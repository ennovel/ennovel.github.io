<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; In the third year of the rule of Belshazzar the king, a vision was seen by me, Daniel, after the one I saw at first. 
<br>8:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 见 了 异 象 的 时 候 ， 我 以 为 在 以 拦 省 书 珊 城 中 （ 城 或 作 宫 ） 。 我 见 异 象 又 如 在 乌 莱 河 边 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And I saw in the vision; and when I saw it, I was in the strong town Shushan, which is in the country of Elam; and in the vision I was by the water-door of the Ulai. 
<br>8:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 举 目 观 看 ， 见 有 双 角 的 公 绵 羊 站 在 河 边 ， 两 角 都 高 。 这 角 高 过 那 角 ， 更 高 的 是 后 长 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And lifting up my eyes, I saw, there before the stream, a male sheep with two horns: and the two horns were high, but one was higher than the other, the higher one coming up last. 
<br>8:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 见 那 公 绵 羊 往 西 ， 往 北 ， 往 南 抵 触 。 兽 在 它 面 前 都 站 立 不 住 ， 也 没 有 能 救 护 脱 离 它 手 的 。 但 它 任 意 而 行 ， 自 高 自 大 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; I saw the sheep pushing to the west and to the north and to the south; and no beasts were able to keep their place before him, and no one was able to get people out of his power; but he did whatever his pleasure was and made himself great. 
<br>8:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 正 思 想 的 时 候 ， 见 有 一 只 公 山 羊 从 西 而 来 ， 遍 行 全 地 ， 脚 不 沾 尘 。 这 山 羊 两 眼 当 中 有 一 非 常 的 角 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And while I was giving thought to this, I saw a he-goat coming from the west over the face of all the earth without touching the earth: and the he-goat had a great horn between his eyes. 
<br>8:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 它 往 我 所 看 见 ， 站 在 河 边 有 双 角 的 公 绵 羊 那 里 去 ， 大 发 忿 怒 ， 向 它 直 闯 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he came to the two-horned sheep which I saw before the stream, rushing at him in the heat of his power. 
<br>8:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 见 公 山 羊 就 近 公 绵 羊 ， 向 它 发 烈 怒 ， 抵 触 它 ， 折 断 它 的 两 角 。 绵 羊 在 它 面 前 站 立 不 住 。 它 将 绵 羊 触 倒 在 地 ， 用 脚 践 踏 ， 没 有 能 救 绵 羊 脱 离 它 手 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And I saw him come right up to the sheep, and he was moved with wrath against him, attacking the sheep so that his two horns were broken; and the sheep had not strength to keep his place before him, but was pushed down on the earth and crushed under his feet: and there was no one to get the sheep out of his power. 
<br>8:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 这 山 羊 极 其 自 高 自 大 ， 正 强 盛 的 时 候 ， 那 大 角 折 断 了 ， 又 在 角 根 上 向 天 的 四 方 （ 方 原 文 作 风 ） 长 出 四 个 非 常 的 角 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the he-goat became very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and in its place came up four other horns turned to the four winds of heaven. 
<br>8:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 四 角 之 中 有 一 角 长 出 一 个 小 角 ， 向 南 ， 向 东 ， 向 荣 美 之 地 ， 渐 渐 成 为 强 大 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And out of one of them came another horn, a little one, which became very great, stretching to the south and to the east and to the beautiful land. 
<br>8:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 它 渐 渐 强 大 ， 高 及 天 象 ， 将 些 天 象 和 星 宿 抛 落 在 地 ， 用 脚 践 踏 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And it became great, even as high as the army of heaven, pulling down some of the army, even of the stars, to the earth and crushing them under its feet. 
<br>8:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 并 且 它 自 高 自 大 ， 以 为 高 及 天 象 之 君 。 除 掉 常 献 给 君 的 燔 祭 ， 毁 坏 君 的 圣 所 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; It made itself great, even as great as the lord of the army; and by it the regular burned offering was taken away, and the place overturned and the holy place made waste. 
<br>8:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 因 罪 过 的 缘 故 ， 有 军 旅 和 常 献 的 燔 祭 交 付 它 。 它 将 真 理 抛 在 地 上 ， 任 意 而 行 ， 无 不 顺 利 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; ... against the regular burned offering; and ... crushed down to the earth, and it did its pleasure and things went well for it. 
<br>8:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 听 见 有 一 位 圣 者 说 话 ， 又 有 一 位 圣 者 问 那 说 话 的 圣 者 说 ， 这 除 掉 常 献 的 燔 祭 和 施 行 毁 坏 的 罪 过 ， 将 圣 所 与 军 旅 践 踏 的 异 象 （ 军 旅 或 作 以 色 列 的 军 ） ， 要 到 几 时 才 应 验 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then there came to my ears the voice of a holy one talking; and another holy one said to that certain one who was talking, How long will the vision be while the regular burned offering is taken away, and the unclean thing causing fear is put up, and the holy place crushed under foot? 
<br>8:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 对 我 说 ， 到 二 千 三 百 日 ， 圣 所 就 必 洁 净 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said to him, For two thousand, three hundred evenings and mornings; then the holy place will be made clean. 
<br>8:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 但 以 理 见 了 这 异 象 ， 愿 意 明 白 其 中 的 意 思 。 忽 有 一 位 形 状 像 人 的 站 在 我 面 前 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And it came about that when I, Daniel, had seen this vision, I had a desire for the sense of it to be unfolded; and I saw one before me in the form of a man. 
<br>8:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 又 听 见 乌 莱 河 两 岸 中 有 人 声 呼 叫 说 ， 加 百 列 阿 ， 要 使 此 人 明 白 这 异 象 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the voice of a man came to my ears between the sides of the Ulai, crying out and saying, Gabriel, make the vision clear to this man. 
<br>8:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 便 来 到 我 所 站 的 地 方 。 他 一 来 ， 我 就 惊 慌 俯 伏 在 地 。 他 对 我 说 ， 人 子 阿 ， 你 要 明 白 ， 因 为 这 是 关 乎 末 后 的 异 象 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So he came and took his place near where I was; and when he came, I was full of fear and went down on my face: but he said to me, Let it be clear to you, O son of man; for the vision has to do with the time of the end. 
<br>8:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 与 我 说 话 的 时 候 ， 我 面 伏 在 地 沉 睡 。 他 就 摸 我 ， 扶 我 站 起 来 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now while he was talking to me, I went into a deep sleep with my face to the earth: but touching me, he put me on my feet where I had been. 
<br>8:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 说 ， 我 要 指 示 你 恼 怒 临 完 必 有 的 事 ， 因 为 这 是 关 乎 末 后 的 定 期 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said, See, I will make clear to you what is to come in the later time of the wrath: for it has to do with the fixed time of the end. 
<br>8:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 所 看 见 双 角 的 公 绵 羊 ， 就 是 玛 代 和 波 斯 王 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The sheep which you saw with two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia. 
<br>8:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 公 山 羊 就 是 希 腊 王 （ 希 腊 原 文 作 雅 完 下 同 ） 。 两 眼 当 中 的 大 角 就 是 头 一 王 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn between his eyes is the first king. 
<br>8:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 至 于 那 折 断 了 的 角 ， 在 其 根 上 又 长 出 四 角 ， 这 四 角 就 是 四 国 ， 必 从 这 国 里 兴 起 来 ， 只 是 权 势 都 不 及 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And as for that which was broken, in place of which four came up, four kingdoms will come up from his nation, but not with his power. 
<br>8:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 这 四 国 末 时 ， 犯 法 的 人 罪 恶 满 盈 ， 必 有 一 王 兴 起 ， 面 貌 凶 恶 ， 能 用 双 关 的 诈 语 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And in the later years of their kingdom, when their evil doings have become complete, there will come up a king full of pride and expert in dark sayings. 
<br>8:24 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 的 权 柄 必 大 ， 却 不 是 因 自 己 的 能 力 。 他 必 行 非 常 的 毁 灭 ， 事 情 顺 利 ， 任 意 而 行 。 又 必 毁 灭 有 能 力 的 和 圣 民 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And his power will be great, and he will be purposing strange things. And all will go well for him and he will do his pleasure; and he will send destruction on the strong ones. 
<br>8:25 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 用 权 术 成 就 手 中 的 诡 计 ， 心 里 自 高 自 大 ， 在 人 坦 然 无 备 的 时 候 ， 毁 灭 多 人 。 又 要 站 起 来 攻 击 万 君 之 君 ， 至 终 却 非 因 人 手 而 灭 亡 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And his designs will be turned against the holy people, causing deceit to do well in his hand; in his heart he will make himself great, and send destruction on numbers who are living unconscious of their danger; and he will put himself up against the prince of princes; but he will be broken, though not by men's hands. 
<br>8:26 [hgb]&nbsp; 所 说 二 千 三 百 日 的 异 象 是 真 的 ， 但 你 要 将 这 异 象 封 住 ， 因 为 关 乎 后 来 许 多 的 日 子 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the vision of evenings and mornings which has been talked of is true: and keep the vision secret; for it has to do with the far-off future. 
<br>8:27 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 我 但 以 理 昏 迷 不 醒 ， 病 了 数 日 ， 然 后 起 来 办 理 王 的 事 务 。 我 因 这 异 象 惊 奇 ， 却 无 人 能 明 白 其 中 的 意 思 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And I, Daniel, was ill for some days; then I got up and did the king's business: and I was full of wonder at the vision, but no one was able to give the sense of it.
