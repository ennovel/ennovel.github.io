<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; In the first year of Belshazzar, king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream, and visions came into his head on his bed: then he put the dream in writing. 
<br>7:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 但 以 理 说 ， 我 夜 里 见 异 象 ， 看 见 天 的 四 风 陡 起 ， 刮 在 大 海 之 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; I had a vision by night, and saw the four winds of heaven violently moving the great sea. 
<br>7:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 有 四 个 大 兽 从 海 中 上 来 ， 形 状 各 有 不 同 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And four great beasts came up from the sea, different one from another. 
<br>7:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 头 一 个 像 狮 子 ， 有 鹰 的 翅 膀 。 我 正 观 看 的 时 候 ， 兽 的 翅 膀 被 拔 去 ， 兽 从 地 上 得 立 起 来 ， 用 两 脚 站 立 ， 像 人 一 样 ， 又 得 了 人 心 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The first was like a lion and had eagle's wings; while I was watching its wings were pulled off, and it was lifted up from the earth and placed on two feet like a man, and a man's heart was given to it. 
<br>7:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 又 有 一 兽 如 熊 ， 就 是 第 二 兽 ， 旁 跨 而 坐 ， 口 齿 内 衔 着 三 根 肋 骨 。 有 吩 咐 这 兽 的 说 ， 起 来 吞 吃 多 肉 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And I saw another beast, like a bear, and it was lifted up on one side, and three side-bones were in its mouth, between its teeth: and they said to it, Up! take much flesh. 
<br>7:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 此 后 我 观 看 ， 又 有 一 兽 如 豹 ， 背 上 有 鸟 的 四 个 翅 膀 。 这 兽 有 四 个 头 ， 又 得 了 权 柄 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; After this I saw another beast, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings like those of a bird; and the beast had four heads, and the power of a ruler was given to it. 
<br>7:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 其 后 我 在 夜 间 的 异 象 中 观 看 ， 见 第 四 兽 甚 是 可 怕 ， 极 其 强 壮 ， 大 有 力 量 ， 有 大 铁 牙 ， 吞 吃 嚼 碎 ， 所 剩 下 的 用 脚 践 踏 。 这 兽 与 前 三 兽 大 不 相 同 ， 头 有 十 角 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; After this, in my vision of the night, I saw a fourth beast, a thing causing fear and very troubling, full of power and very strong; and it had great iron teeth: it took its food, crushing some of it to bits and stamping down the rest with its feet: it was different from all the beasts before it; and it had ten horns. 
<br>7:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 正 观 看 这 些 角 ， 见 其 中 又 长 起 一 个 小 角 。 先 前 的 角 中 有 三 角 在 这 角 前 ， 连 根 被 它 拔 出 来 。 这 角 有 眼 ， 像 人 的 眼 ， 有 口 说 夸 大 的 话 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; I was watching the horns with care, and I saw another coming up among them, a little one, before which three of the first horns were pulled up by the roots: and there were eyes like a man's eyes in this horn, and a mouth saying great things. 
<br>7:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 观 看 ， 见 有 宝 座 设 立 ， 上 头 坐 着 亘 古 常 在 者 。 他 的 衣 服 洁 白 如 雪 ， 头 发 如 纯 净 的 羊 毛 。 宝 座 乃 火 焰 ， 其 轮 乃 烈 火 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; I went on looking till the seats of kings were placed, and one like a very old man took his seat: his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head was like clean wool; his seat was flames of fire and its wheels burning fire. 
<br>7:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 从 他 面 前 有 火 ， 像 河 发 出 。 事 奉 他 的 有 千 千 ， 在 他 面 前 侍 立 的 有 万 万 。 他 坐 着 要 行 审 判 ， 案 卷 都 展 开 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; A stream of fire was flowing and coming out from before him: a thousand thousands were his servants, and ten thousand times ten thousand were in their places before him: the judge was seated and the books were open. 
<br>7:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 时 我 观 看 ， 见 那 兽 因 小 角 说 夸 大 话 的 声 音 被 杀 ， 身 体 损 坏 ， 扔 在 火 中 焚 烧 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then I saw--because of the voice of the great words which the horn said--I saw till the beast was put to death, and its body was given to destruction, and the beast was given to the burning of fire. 
<br>7:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 其 余 的 兽 ， 权 柄 都 被 夺 去 ， 生 命 却 仍 存 留 ， 直 到 所 定 的 时 候 和 日 期 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; As for the rest of the beasts, their authority was taken away: but they let them go on living for a measure of time. 
<br>7:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 在 夜 间 的 异 象 中 观 看 ， 见 有 一 位 像 人 子 的 ， 驾 着 天 云 而 来 ， 被 领 到 亘 古 常 在 者 面 前 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; I saw in visions of the night, and there was coming with the clouds of heaven one like a man, and he came to the one who was very old, and they took him near before him. 
<br>7:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 得 了 权 柄 ， 荣 耀 ， 国 度 ， 使 各 方 ， 各 国 ， 各 族 的 人 都 事 奉 他 。 他 的 权 柄 是 永 远 的 ， 不 能 废 去 。 他 的 国 必 不 败 坏 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And to him was given authority and glory and a kingdom; and all peoples, nations, and languages were his servants: his authority is an eternal authority which will not come to an end, and his kingdom is one which will not come to destruction. 
<br>7:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 至 于 我 但 以 理 ， 我 的 灵 在 我 里 面 愁 烦 ， 我 脑 中 的 异 象 使 我 惊 惶 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; As for me, Daniel, my spirit was pained because of this, and the visions of my head were troubling me. 
<br>7:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 就 近 一 位 侍 立 者 ， 问 他 这 一 切 的 真 情 。 他 就 告 诉 我 ， 将 那 事 的 讲 解 给 我 说 明 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; I came near to one of those who were waiting there, questioning him about what all this was. And he said to me that he would make clear to me the sense of these things. 
<br>7:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 这 四 个 大 兽 就 是 四 王 将 要 在 世 上 兴 起 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; These great beasts are four kings who will be cut off from the earth. 
<br>7:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 然 而 ， 至 高 者 的 圣 民 ， 必 要 得 国 享 受 ， 直 到 永 永 远 远 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But the saints of the Most High will take the kingdom, and it will be theirs for ever, even for ever and ever. 
<br>7:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 时 我 愿 知 道 第 四 兽 的 真 情 ， 它 为 何 与 那 三 兽 的 真 情 大 不 相 同 ， 甚 是 可 怕 ， 有 铁 牙 铜 爪 ， 吞 吃 嚼 碎 ， 所 剩 下 的 用 脚 践 踏 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then it was my desire to have certain knowledge about the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, a cause of great fear, whose teeth were of iron and his nails of brass; who took his food, crushing some of it to bits and stamping on the rest with his feet; 
<br>7:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 头 有 十 角 和 那 另 长 的 一 角 ， 在 这 角 前 有 三 角 被 它 打 落 。 这 角 有 眼 ， 有 说 夸 大 话 的 口 ， 形 状 强 横 ， 过 于 它 的 同 类 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And about the ten horns on his head and the other which came up, causing the fall of three; that horn which had eyes, and a mouth saying great things, which seemed to be greater than the other horns. 
<br>7:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 观 看 ， 见 这 角 与 圣 民 争 战 ， 胜 了 他 们 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And I saw how that horn made war on the saints and overcame them, 
<br>7:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 直 到 亘 古 常 在 者 来 给 至 高 者 的 圣 民 伸 冤 ， 圣 民 得 国 的 时 候 就 到 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Till he came, who was very old, and the decision was made and the authority was given to the saints of the Most High; and the time came when the saints took the kingdom. 
<br>7:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 侍 立 者 这 样 说 ， 第 四 兽 就 是 世 上 必 有 的 第 四 国 ， 与 一 切 国 大 不 相 同 ， 必 吞 吃 全 地 ， 并 且 践 踏 嚼 碎 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; This is what he said: The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom which will come on earth, different from all the kingdoms, and it will overcome all the earth, crushing it down and smashing it. 
<br>7:24 [hgb]&nbsp; 至 于 那 十 角 ， 就 是 从 这 国 中 必 兴 起 的 十 王 ， 后 来 又 兴 起 一 王 ， 与 先 前 的 不 同 。 他 必 制 伏 三 王 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will come to power; and after them another will come up: he will be different from the first ones and will put down three kings. 
<br>7:25 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 必 向 至 高 者 说 夸 大 的 话 ， 必 折 磨 至 高 者 的 圣 民 ， 必 想 改 变 节 期 和 律 法 。 圣 民 必 交 付 他 手 一 载 ， 二 载 ， 半 载 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he will say words against the Most High, attempting to put an end to the saints of the Most High; and he will have the idea of changing times and law; and the saints will be given into his hands for a time and times and half a time. 
<br>7:26 [hgb]&nbsp; 然 而 ， 审 判 者 必 坐 着 行 审 判 。 他 的 权 柄 必 被 夺 去 ， 毁 坏 ， 灭 绝 ， 一 直 到 底 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But the judge will be seated, and they will put an end to his authority, to overcome it and send complete destruction on it. 
<br>7:27 [hgb]&nbsp; 国 度 ， 权 柄 ， 和 天 下 诸 国 的 大 权 必 赐 给 至 高 者 的 圣 民 。 他 的 国 是 永 远 的 。 一 切 掌 权 的 都 必 事 奉 他 ， 顺 从 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the kingdom and the authority and the power of the kingdoms under all the heaven will be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and all powers will be his servants and do his pleasure. 
<br>7:28 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 事 至 此 完 毕 。 至 于 我 但 以 理 ， 心 中 甚 是 惊 惶 ， 脸 色 也 改 变 了 ， 却 将 那 事 存 记 在 心 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Here is the end of the account. As for me, Daniel, I was greatly troubled by my thoughts, and the colour went from my face: but I kept the thing in my heart.
