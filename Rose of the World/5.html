It was part of his programme to study the lesser as well as the great. And, having to his satisfaction completed his psychological analysis of a ruler in chief, he told himself that half a page or so consecrated to one of the pawns in the great chess game of empire would not be without entertainment to his readers—especially as in the lean taciturn Scotsman he believed to have lighted on the type le plus net of the "Anglo-Saxon" soldier.
<br> 
<br> With this idea in view he had watched his subject with the keenness of the collector already some time before his departure, and had been interested in a little scene between host and guest. With a purposeful yet respectful stride, Bethune had approached the Governor and addressed him in an undertone. Sir Arthur had listened and responded with urbanity and condescension. Whereupon the officer had bowed in what seemed grateful acknowledgment; and, as he had turned away, the astute Frenchman had thought to read upon his countenance, saturnine as it was, a certain unmistakable satisfaction.
<br> 
<br> Therefore, when they started on their way down to the town, the traveller could think of no better topic for opening the conversation with his dissimilar companion than praise of the official who had evidently just granted him some important request.
<br> 
<br> "A charming personality, our host, is he not?"
<br> 
<br> "No doubt."
<br> 
<br> Bethune's tone was discouraging—but these diables d'Anglo-Saxons (as M. Chatelard knew) wanted drawing out. So, undauntedly genial, he pursued:
<br> 
<br> "And one of your great politicians, hein? The square man in the square place, as you say."
<br> 
<br> This being a mere statement, Bethune did not feel called upon to reply; and M. Chatelard, amazed at a silence which he, with subtlety, interpreted as hostile, was fain to exclaim:
<br> 
<br> "Is it possible you do not think so?"
<br> 
<br> "I do not feel myself competent to judge," said Raymond Bethune.
<br> 
<br> "My faith," thought the other, "we do not make great progress at this rate. Let us try something more intimate. At least, my young friend," he went on aloud, "you have, I trust, yourself no cause to be dissatisfied with his Excellency. Some little demand you made of him to-night, did you not? Some matter concerning career, advancement?"
<br> 
<br> "My career, my advancement, are quite independent of Sir Arthur Gerardine's influence."
<br> 
<br> M. Chatelard pondered; was there not certainly something more than British reserve in the almost resentful tone—some deep-lying grudge that it would be piquant to find out?
<br> 
<br> "Why, then," he cried, with much artful artlessness of candour. "Why, see how one can deceive one's self! Just now I would have sworn, from your attitude, despite your national phlegm, that you had solicited and been granted some personal favour."
<br> 
<br> "A personal favour, yes. Nothing connected with my service."
<br> 
<br> "A personal favour, hein?"
<br> 
<br> "If indeed you would reckon it a favour—a mere act of justice I regard it."
<br> 
<br> "Indeed, my dear sir, an act of justice?"
<br> 
<br> "The whole affair is one that could not interest you, M. Chatelard."
<br> 
<br> "My dear young man, all interests me. It is my trade to be interested—always."
<br> 
<br> They had reached the end of the palace grounds; and, by the lights of the flaring booths that were plastered against the walls, Bethune halted a second to survey the shrewd, kindly, expressive countenance, quivering with eager curiosity, at his shoulder.
<br> 
<br> His own features relaxed with that twinkle of the eyes which was his usual approach to a display of amusement. After all, why should he not gratify this note-taking traveller with his tale? There was no mystery about it; and a plain statement of the situation might serve to put in order his own ideas which had been troubled by Lady Gerardine's unreasonable and unexpected attitude.
<br> 
<br> "My business with Sir Arthur to-night is soon told——" He broke off abruptly. "You are, I understand, a sedulous observer: did you happen to take any note of her Excellency the Governor's wife?"
<br> 
<br> "Did I take any note of——" the sentence escaped M. Chatelard in a breathless way—as if the words had been knocked out of him—and ended in a little squeak. He drew back one step and contemplated the younger man in silence for a perceptible moment. "Did I notice her Excellency?" he repeated then, in elaborately natural tones. "Why, my dear fellow, it would mean having no eyes not to notice her—one of the most beautiful women it has ever been my good fortune to see! In fact, to-night, still under the influence of the look in her eyes, I should say, my friend, the most beautiful! Lucky dog (as you say) your Governor!"
<br> 
<br> Bethune threw away the match with which he had been lighting his cigar and blew a contemptuous puff.
<br> 
<br> "Before she married Sir Arthur," said he, "she was the wife of a comrade of mine. It is my desire, it is my intention, to write the life of that comrade. I require the co-operation of Lady Gerardine. She refused it to me. I went to Sir Arthur."
<br> 
<br> "You went to Sir Arthur," repeated the Frenchman, in tones of one almost stunned with amazement.
<br> 
<br> "Yes," answered the officer, gravely. "To make her accede to my request."
<br> 
<br> "And he——"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, he has promised to see that she does so at once."
<br> 
<br> For a while M. Chatelard was fain to proceed in silence, words failing him before so extraordinary a situation. As he went he regarded the Englishman with ever-increasing respect, admiration, not to say enthusiasm.
<br> 
<br> "Voilà qui est raide ... voilà qui est fort!" he was saying to himself. "Was I not right to tell myself that there was something truly remarkable about this young man? What a drama! What could not our Balzac have made of it! The well-conserved—but elderly, yes, elderly husband; the young, lovely, bored wife—ah, but she bores herself, the young wife! And then this young, handsome, sinister officer who has known her before, loved her it is clear from the first—the wife of his comrade! He comes to her with a plan ... a plan of an astuteness to deceive an angel. But the woman who loves is never deceived. Because she loves him, she reads his heart. Virtuous, she refuses.... They are both young, she knows her weakness. She bores herself, yes, she bores herself, but she refuses. And he, what does he do, the young, silent, determined adorer? My faith, it is the simplicity of genius: he goes to the old husband, that the old husband may order her to yield to his scheme. And the husband—and this is the strangest part of it all—what does he say? Oh, it is simple, simple in the extreme. He promises to do so at once. What a story! And my friend here, under the starlight, qualifies it in three words: 'No favour—justice.' It is of a cynicism! Yet yonder he stands, as grave and cold as a judge. Poor Sir Gerardine. But here is a young man who will make his way—and, for the psychologist, what a study!"
<br> 
<br> "My faith," said he aloud, "but you have courage, sir."
<br> 
<br> "Courage?"
<br> 
<br> "Ah, you thought I did not notice Lady Gerardine! I will tell you something—as one man to another—she is one who will not make her lover's task easy to him, nor amusing, hey! With her it will be all or nothing: the grand passion. Ah, my gallant friend, believe the word of one who has had experience in these matters! Avoid the grand passion, for it's what makes cinders of our manhood."
<br> 
<br> It was Bethune's turn to halt amazed.
<br> 
<br> "I beg your pardon," he exclaimed. "But are you warning me against falling in love with Lady Gerardine?" Then, overcome with the humour of the idea, he threw back his head and gave vent to his short laugh.
<br> 
<br> In this laugh, however, M. Chatelard's acumen was pleased to discover a concentrated bitterness; in the touch upon his arm, a menace to the interferer.
<br> 
<br> "Nay, heaven forfend!" he cried, dropping the personal tone with a hasty return to natural good-breeding. "It only struck me, sir, that your programme was a little dangerous. And for one like myself, who has made a study of women, Lady Gerardine is a type—a type rare, fortunately, perhaps, for the peace of the world, but, heavens, of what palpitating allurement when one does come across it!"
<br> 
<br> "A type of a very selfish woman," said Bethune, shortly. And this time the physician was not far wrong in noting bitterness in his tone. "As cold as a stone, I should say, and as self-centred as a cat."
<br> 
<br> "Self-centred, I grant you. But cold?" screamed the Frenchman.
<br> 
<br> "As cold at heart as she is white in face," said Harry English's comrade.
<br> 
<br> "White? so is the flame at its intensest! Cold? With that glow in her hair? With that look in the eyes—those lips? Touch that coldness and you will burn to the bone. Ah, it is not the old husband that will feel that fire! But the fire is there, all the fiercer for being concentrated. Ah, when she lets herself go, her Excellency, it will be terrible—it will be grand! There are conflagrations which make the very skies grow red."
<br> 
<br> "My way branches off here," interrupted Bethune, drily, "and yonder are the lights of your hotel. Good night."
<br> 
<br> He shook hands loosely, and was gone before the globe-trotter, interrupted in full eloquence, had had time to lay hold of his formal French manner for the farewell ceremony.
<br> 
<br> "I have pressed him a little too closely," he thought, as he stood watching the soldierly figure swing away from light to darkness, down the narrow street dotted with gaudy booths. "He is already on the fatal slope.... I must not let the end of this drama escape me."
<br> 
<br> Raymond Bethune, as he strode along, laughed to himself at "the French Johnny's" nonsense. Nevertheless a phrase or two seemed to circle in his mind round the baffling image of his friend's widow like a flight of birds round the head of a sphinx: "White? so is the flame at its intensest. Cold? Touch that coldness and be burned to the bone...."
