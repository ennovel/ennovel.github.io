Gertrude Lodge, having beenadmitted to the jail as above described, was sitting in a waiting-room within the second gate, which stood under a classic archway ofashlar, then comparatively modern, and bearing the inscription,'COVNTY JAIL: 1793.' This had been the facade she saw from theheath the day before. Near at hand was a passage to the roof onwhich the gallows stood.</p> 
<p>　　The town was thronged, and the market suspended; but Gertrude hadseen scarcely a soul. Having kept her room till the hour of theappointment, she had proceeded to the spot by a way which avoidedthe open space below the cliff where the spectators had gathered;but she could, even now, hear the multitudinous babble of theirvoices, out of which rose at intervals the hoarse croak of a singlevoice uttering the words, 'Last dying speech and confession!' Therehad been no reprieve, and the execution was over; but the crowdstill waited to see the body taken down.</p> 
<p>　　Soon the persistent girl heard a trampling overhead, then a handbeckoned to her, and, following directions, she went out and crossedthe inner paved court beyond the gatehouse, her knees trembling sothat she could scarcely walk. One of her arms was out of itssleeve, and only covered by her shawl.</p> 
<p>　　On the spot at which she had now arrived were two trestles, andbefore she could think of their purpose she heard heavy feetdescending stairs somewhere at her back. Turn her head she wouldnot, or could not, and, rigid in this position, she was conscious ofa rough coffin passing her shoulder, borne by four men. It wasopen, and in it lay the body of a young man, wearing the smockfrockof a rustic, and fustian breeches. The corpse had been thrown intothe coffin so hastily that the skirt of the smockfrock was hangingover. The burden was temporarily deposited on the trestles.</p> 
<p>　　By this time the young woman's state was such that a gray mistseemed to float before her eyes, on account of which, and the veilshe wore, she could scarcely discern anything: it was as though shehad nearly died, but was held up by a sort of galvanism.</p> 
<p>　　'Now!' said a voice close at hand, and she was just conscious thatthe word had been addressed to her.</p> 
<p>　　By a last strenuous effort she advanced, at the same time hearingpersons approaching behind her. She bared her poor curst arm; andDavies, uncovering the face of the corpse, took Gertrude's hand, andheld it so that her arm lay across the dead man's neck, upon a linethe colour of an unripe blackberry, which surrounded it.</p> 
<p>　　Gertrude shrieked: 'the turn o' the blood,' predicted by theconjuror, had taken place. But at that moment a second shriek rentthe air of the enclosure: it was not Gertrude's, and its effectupon her was to make her start round.</p> 
<p>　　Immediately behind her stood Rhoda Brook, her face drawn, and hereyes red with weeping. Behind Rhoda stood Gertrude's own husband;his countenance lined, his eyes dim, but without a tear.</p> 
<p>　　'D-n you! what are you doing here?' he said hoarsely.</p> 
<p>　　'Hussy--to come between us and our child now!' cried Rhoda. 'Thisis the meaning of what Satan showed me in the vision! You are likeher at last!' And clutching the bare arm of the younger woman, shepulled her unresistingly back against the wall. Immediately Brookhad loosened her hold the fragile young Gertrude slid down againstthe feet of her husband. When he lifted her up she was unconscious.</p> 
<p>　　The mere sight of the twain had been enough to suggest to her thatthe dead young man was Rhoda's son. At that time the relatives ofan executed convict had the privilege of claiming the body forburial, if they chose to do so; and it was for this purpose thatLodge was awaiting the inquest with Rhoda. He had been summoned byher as soon as the young man was taken in the crime, and atdifferent times since; and he had attended in court during thetrial. This was the 'holiday' he had been indulging in of late.</p> 
<p>　　The two wretched parents had wished to avoid exposure; and hence hadcome themselves for the body, a waggon and sheet for its conveyanceand covering being in waiting outside.</p> 
<p>　　Gertrude's case was so serious that it was deemed advisable to callto her the surgeon who was at hand. She was taken out of the jailinto the town; but she never reached home alive. Her delicatevitality, sapped perhaps by the paralyzed arm, collapsed under thedouble shock that followed the severe strain, physical and mental,to which she had subjected herself during the previous twenty-fourhours. Her blood had been 'turned' indeed--too far. Her death tookplace in the town three days after.</p> 
<p>　　Her husband was never seen in Casterbridge again; once only in theold market-place at Anglebury, which he had so much frequented, andvery seldom in public anywhere. Burdened at first with moodinessand remorse, he eventually changed for the better, and appeared as achastened and thoughtful man. Soon after attending the funeral ofhis poor young wife he took steps towards giving up the farms inHolmstoke and the adjoining parish, and, having sold every head ofhis stock, he went away to Port-Bredy, at the other end of thecounty, living there in solitary lodgings till his death two yearslater of a painless decline. It was then found that he hadbequeathed the whole of his not inconsiderable property to areformatory for boys, subject to the payment of a small annuity toRhoda Brook, if she could be found to claim it.</p> 
<p>　　For some time she could not be found; but eventually she reappearedin her old parish,--absolutely refusing, however, to have anythingto do with the provision made for her. Her monotonous milking atthe dairy was resumed, and followed for many long years, till herform became bent, and her once abundant dark hair white and wornaway at the forehead--perhaps by long pressure against the cows.</p> 
<p>　　Here, sometimes, those who knew her experiences would stand andobserve her, and wonder what sombre thoughts were beating insidethat impassive, wrinkled brow, to the rhythm of the alternatingmilk-streams.</p>
