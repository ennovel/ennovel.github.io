But she had promised to go. Moreover, there was a horridfascination at times in becoming instrumental in throwing suchpossible light on her own character as would reveal her to besomething greater in the occult world than she had ever herselfsuspected.</p> 
<p>　　She started just before the time of day mentioned between them, andhalf-an-hour's brisk walking brought her to the south-easternextension of the Egdon tract of country, where the fir plantationwas. A slight figure, cloaked and veiled, was already there. Rhodarecognized, almost with a shudder, that Mrs. Lodge bore her left armin a sling.</p> 
<p>　　They hardly spoke to each other, and immediately set out on theirclimb into the interior of this solemn country, which stood highabove the rich alluvial soil they had left half-an-hour before. Itwas a long walk; thick clouds made the atmosphere dark, though itwas as yet only early afternoon; and the wind howled dismally overthe hills of the heath--not improbably the same heath which hadwitnessed the agony of the Wessex King Ina, presented to after-agesas Lear. Gertrude Lodge talked most, Rhoda replying withmonosyllabic preoccupation. She had a strange dislike to walking onthe side of her companion where hung the afflicted arm, moving roundto the other when inadvertently near it. Much heather had beenbrushed by their feet when they descended upon a cart-track, besidewhich stood the house of the man they sought.</p> 
<p>　　He did not profess his remedial practices openly, or care anythingabout their continuance, his direct interests being those of adealer in furze, turf, 'sharp sand,' and other local products.</p> 
<p>　　Indeed, he affected not to believe largely in his own powers, andwhen warts that had been shown him for cure miraculouslydisappeared--which it must be owned they infallibly did--he wouldsay lightly, 'O, I only drink a glass of grog upon 'em--perhaps it'sall chance,' and immediately turn the subject.</p> 
<p>　　He was at home when they arrived, having in fact seen themdescending into his valley. He was a gray-bearded man, with areddish face, and he looked singularly at Rhoda the first moment hebeheld her. Mrs. Lodge told him her errand; and then with words ofself-disparagement he examined her arm.</p> 
<p>　　'Medicine can't cure it,' he said promptly. ''Tis the work of anenemy.'</p> 
<p>　　Rhoda shrank into herself, and drew back.</p> 
<p>　　'An enemy? What enemy?' asked Mrs. Lodge.</p> 
<p>　　He shook his head. 'That's best known to yourself,' he said. 'Ifyou like, I can show the person to you, though I shall not myselfknow who it is. I can do no more; and don't wish to do that.'</p> 
<p>　　She pressed him; on which he told Rhoda to wait outside where shestood, and took Mrs. Lodge into the room. It opened immediatelyfrom the door; and, as the latter remained ajar, Rhoda Brook couldsee the proceedings without taking part in them. He brought atumbler from the dresser, nearly filled it with water, and fetchingan egg, prepared it in some private way; after which he broke it onthe edge of the glass, so that the white went in and the yolkremained. As it was getting gloomy, he took the glass and itscontents to the window, and told Gertrude to watch them closely.</p> 
<p>　　They leant over the table together, and the milkwoman could see theopaline hue of the egg-fluid changing form as it sank in the water,but she was not near enough to define the shape that it assumed.</p> 
<p>　　'Do you catch the likeness of any face or figure as you look?'</p> 
<p>　　demanded the conjuror of the young woman.</p> 
<p>　　She murmured a reply, in tones so low as to be inaudible to Rhoda,and continued to gaze intently into the glass. Rhoda turned, andwalked a few steps away.</p> 
<p>　　When Mrs. Lodge came out, and her face was met by the light, itappeared exceedingly pale--as pale as Rhoda's--against the sad dunshades of the upland's garniture. Trendle shut the door behind her,and they at once started homeward together. But Rhoda perceivedthat her companion had quite changed.</p> 
<p>　　'Did he charge much?' she asked tentatively.</p> 
<p>　　'O no--nothing. He would not take a farthing,' said Gertrude.</p> 
<p>　　'And what did you see?' inquired Rhoda.</p> 
<p>　　'Nothing I--care to speak of.' The constraint in her manner wasremarkable; her face was so rigid as to wear an oldened aspect,faintly suggestive of the face in Rhoda's bed-chamber.</p> 
<p>　　'Was it you who first proposed coming here?' Mrs. Lodge suddenlyinquired, after a long pause. 'How very odd, if you did!'</p> 
<p>　　'No. But I am not sorry we have come, all things considered,' shereplied. For the first time a sense of triumph possessed her, andshe did not altogether deplore that the young thing at her sideshould learn that their lives had been antagonized by otherinfluences than their own.</p> 
<p>　　The subject was no more alluded to during the long and dreary walkhome. But in some way or other a story was whispered about themany-dairied lowland that winter that Mrs. Lodge's gradual loss ofthe use of her left arm was owing to her being 'overlooked' by RhodaBrook. The latter kept her own counsel about the incubus, but herface grew sadder and thinner; and in the spring she and her boydisappeared from the neighbourhood of Holmstoke.</p>
