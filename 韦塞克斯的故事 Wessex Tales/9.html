The farmer was usuallygloomy and silent: the woman whom he had wooed for her grace andbeauty was contorted and disfigured in the left limb; moreover, shehad brought him no child, which rendered it likely that he would bethe last of a family who had occupied that valley for some twohundred years. He thought of Rhoda Brook and her son; and fearedthis might be a judgment from heaven upon him.</p> 
<p>　　The once blithe-hearted and enlightened Gertrude was changing intoan irritable, superstitious woman, whose whole time was given toexperimenting upon her ailment with every quack remedy she cameacross. She was honestly attached to her husband, and was eversecretly hoping against hope to win back his heart again byregaining some at least of her personal beauty. Hence it arose thather closet was lined with bottles, packets, and ointment-pots ofevery description--nay, bunches of mystic herbs, charms, and booksof necromancy, which in her schoolgirl time she would have ridiculedas folly.</p> 
<p>　　'Damned if you won't poison yourself with these apothecary messesand witch mixtures some time or other,' said her husband, when hiseye chanced to fall upon the multitudinous array.</p> 
<p>　　She did not reply, but turned her sad, soft glance upon him in suchheart-swollen reproach that he looked sorry for his words, andadded, 'I only meant it for your good, you know, Gertrude.'</p> 
<p>　　'I'll clear out the whole lot, and destroy them,' said she huskily,'and try such remedies no more!'</p> 
<p>　　'You want somebody to cheer you,' he observed. 'I once thought ofadopting a boy; but he is too old now. And he is gone away I don'tknow where.'</p> 
<p>　　She guessed to whom he alluded; for Rhoda Brook's story had in thecourse of years become known to her; though not a word had everpassed between her husband and herself on the subject. Neither hadshe ever spoken to him of her visit to Conjuror Trendle, and of whatwas revealed to her, or she thought was revealed to her, by thatsolitary heath-man.</p> 
<p>　　She was now five-and-twenty; but she seemed older.</p> 
<p>　　'Six years of marriage, and only a few months of love,' shesometimes whispered to herself. And then she thought of theapparent cause, and said, with a tragic glance at her witheringlimb, 'If I could only again be as I was when he first saw me!'</p> 
<p>　　She obediently destroyed her nostrums and charms; but there remaineda hankering wish to try something else--some other sort of curealtogether. She had never revisited Trendle since she had beenconducted to the house of the solitary by Rhoda against her will;but it now suddenly occurred to Gertrude that she would, in a lastdesperate effort at deliverance from this seeming curse, again seekout the man, if he yet lived. He was entitled to a certaincredence, for the indistinct form he had raised in the glass hadundoubtedly resembled the only woman in the world who--as she nowknew, though not then--could have a reason for bearing her ill-will.</p> 
<p>　　The visit should be paid.</p> 
<p>　　This time she went alone, though she nearly got lost on the heath,and roamed a considerable distance out of her way. Trendle's housewas reached at last, however: he was not indoors, and instead ofwaiting at the cottage, she went to where his bent figure waspointed out to her at work a long way off. Trendle remembered her,and laying down the handful of furze-roots which he was gatheringand throwing into a heap, he offered to accompany her in herhomeward direction, as the distance was considerable and the dayswere short. So they walked together, his head bowed nearly to theearth, and his form of a colour with it.</p> 
<p>　　'You can send away warts and other excrescences I know,' she said;'why can't you send away this?' And the arm was uncovered.</p> 
<p>　　'You think too much of my powers!' said Trendle; 'and I am old andweak now, too. No, no; it is too much for me to attempt in my ownperson. What have ye tried?'</p> 
<p>　　She named to him some of the hundred medicaments and counterspellswhich she had adopted from time to time. He shook his head.</p> 
<p>　　'Some were good enough,' he said approvingly; 'but not many of themfor such as this. This is of the nature of a blight, not of thenature of a wound; and if you ever do throw it off; it will be allat once.'</p> 
<p>　　'If I only could!'</p> 
<p>　　'There is only one chance of doing it known to me. It has neverfailed in kindred afflictions,--that I can declare. But it is hardto carry out, and especially for a woman.'</p> 
<p>　　'Tell me!' said she.</p> 
<p>　　'You must touch with the limb the neck of a man who's been hanged.'</p> 
<p>　　She started a little at the image he had raised.</p> 
<p>　　'Before he's cold--just after he's cut down,' continued the conjurorimpassively.</p> 
<p>　　'How can that do good?'</p> 
<p>　　'It will turn the blood and change the constitution. But, as I say,to do it is hard. You must get into jail, and wait for him whenhe's brought off the gallows. Lots have done it, though perhaps notsuch pretty women as you. I used to send dozens for skincomplaints. But that was in former times. The last I sent was in'13--near twenty years ago.'</p> 
<p>　　He had no more to tell her; and, when he had put her into a straighttrack homeward, turned and left her, refusing all money as at first.</p>
