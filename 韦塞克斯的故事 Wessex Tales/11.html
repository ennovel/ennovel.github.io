Gertrude found, on inquiry, that theCasterbridge official dwelt in a lonely cottage by a deep slow riverflowing under the cliff on which the prison buildings were situate--the stream being the self-same one, though she did not know it,which watered the Stickleford and Holmstoke meads lower down in itscourse.</p> 
<p>　　Having changed her dress, and before she had eaten or drunk--for shecould not take her ease till she had ascertained some particulars--Gertrude pursued her way by a path along the water-side to thecottage indicated. Passing thus the outskirts of the jail, shediscerned on the level roof over the gateway three rectangular linesagainst the sky, where the specks had been moving in her distantview; she recognized what the erection was, and passed quickly on.</p> 
<p>　　Another hundred yards brought her to the executioner's house, whicha boy pointed out It stood close to the same stream, and was hard bya weir, the waters of which emitted a steady roar.</p> 
<p>　　While she stood hesitating the door opened, and an old man cameforth shading a candle with one hand. Locking the door on theoutside, he turned to a flight of wooden steps fixed against the endof the cottage, and began to ascend them, this being evidently thestaircase to his bedroom. Gertrude hastened forward, but by thetime she reached the foot of the ladder he was at the top. Shecalled to him loudly enough to be heard above the roar of the weir;he looked down and said, 'What d'ye want here?'</p> 
<p>　　'To speak to you a minute.'</p> 
<p>　　The candle-light, such as it was, fell upon her imploring, pale,upturned face, and Davies (as the hangman was called) backed downthe ladder. 'I was just going to bed,' he said; '"Early to bed andearly to rise," but I don't mind stopping a minute for such a one asyou. Come into house.' He reopened the door, and preceded her tothe room within.</p> 
<p>　　The implements of his daily work, which was that of a jobbinggardener, stood in a corner, and seeing probably that she lookedrural, he said, 'If you want me to undertake country work I can'tcome, for I never leave Casterbridge for gentle nor simple--not I.</p> 
<p>　　My real calling is officer of justice,' he added formally.</p> 
<p>　　'Yes, yes! That's it. To-morrow!'</p> 
<p>　　'Ah! I thought so. Well, what's the matter about that? 'Tis nouse to come here about the knot--folks do come continually, but Itell 'em one knot is as merciful as another if ye keep it under theear. Is the unfortunate man a relation; or, I should say, perhaps'</p> 
<p>　　(looking at her dress) 'a person who's been in your employ?'</p> 
<p>　　'No. What time is the execution?'</p> 
<p>　　'The same as usual--twelve o'clock, or as soon after as the Londonmail-coach gets in. We always wait for that, in case of areprieve.'</p> 
<p>　　'O--a reprieve--I hope not!' she said involuntarily,'Well,--hee, hee!--as a matter of business, so do I! But still, ifever a young fellow deserved to be let off, this one does; only justturned eighteen, and only present by chance when the rick was fired.</p> 
<p>　　Howsomever, there's not much risk of it, as they are obliged to makean example of him, there having been so much destruction of propertythat way lately.'</p> 
<p>　　'I mean,' she explained, 'that I want to touch him for a charm, acure of an affliction, by the advice of a man who has proved thevirtue of the remedy.'</p> 
<p>　　'O yes, miss! Now I understand. I've had such people come in pastyears. But it didn't strike me that you looked of a sort to requireblood-turning. What's the complaint? The wrong kind for this, I'llbe bound.'</p> 
<p>　　'My arm.' She reluctantly showed the withered skin.</p> 
<p>　　'Ah--'tis all a-scram!' said the hangman, examining it.</p> 
<p>　　'Yes,' said she.</p> 
<p>　　'Well,' he continued, with interest, 'that IS the class o' subject,I'm bound to admit! I like the look of the place; it is truly assuitable for the cure as any I ever saw. 'Twas a knowing-man thatsent 'ee, whoever he was.'</p> 
<p>　　'You can contrive for me all that's necessary?' she saidbreathlessly.</p> 
<p>　　'You should really have gone to the governor of the jail, and yourdoctor with 'ee, and given your name and address--that's how it usedto be done, if I recollect. Still, perhaps, I can manage it for atrifling fee.'</p> 
<p>　　'O, thank you! I would rather do it this way, as I should like itkept private.'</p> 
<p>　　'Lover not to know, eh?'</p> 
<p>　　'No--husband.'</p> 
<p>　　'Aha! Very well. I'll get ee' a touch of the corpse.'</p> 
<p>　　'Where is it now?' she said, shuddering.</p> 
<p>　　'It?--HE, you mean; he's living yet. Just inside that little smallwinder up there in the glum.' He signified the jail on the cliffabove.</p> 
<p>　　She thought of her husband and her friends. 'Yes, of course,' shesaid; 'and how am I to proceed?'</p> 
<p>　　He took her to the door. 'Now, do you be waiting at the littlewicket in the wall, that you'll find up there in the lane, not laterthan one o'clock. I will open it from the inside, as I shan't comehome to dinner till he's cut down. Good-night. Be punctual; and ifyou don't want anybody to know 'ee, wear a veil. Ah--once I hadsuch a daughter as you!'</p> 
<p>　　She went away, and climbed the path above, to assure herself thatshe would be able to find the wicket next day. Its outline was soonvisible to her--a narrow opening in the outer wall of the prisonprecincts. The steep was so great that, having reached the wicket,she stopped a moment to breathe; and, looking back upon the water-side cot, saw the hangman again ascending his outdoor staircase. Heentered the loft or chamber to which it led, and in a few minutesextinguished his light.</p> 
<p>　　The town clock struck ten, and she returned to the White Hart as shehad come.</p>
