A finesleet had begun to fall, and they trotted across the yard quickly.</p> 
<p>　　The stable-door was open; a light shone from it--from the lanternwhich always hung there, and which Philip had lighted, as he said.</p> 
<p>　　Softly nearing the door, Mrs. Hall pronounced the name 'Helena!'</p> 
<p>　　There was no answer for the moment. Looking in she was taken bysurprise. Two people appeared before her. For one, instead of thedrabbish woman she had expected, Mrs. Hall saw a pale, dark-eyed,ladylike creature, whose personality ruled her attire rather thanwas ruled by it. She was in a new and handsome gown, of course, andan old bonnet. She was standing up, agitated; her hand was held byher companion--none else than Sally's affianced, Farmer CharlesDarton, upon whose fine figure the pale stranger's eyes were fixed,as his were fixed upon her. His other hand held the rein of hishorse, which was standing saddled as if just led in.</p> 
<p>　　At sight of Mrs. Hall they both turned, looking at her in a wayneither quite conscious nor unconscious, and without seeming torecollect that words were necessary as a solution to the scene. Inanother moment Sally entered also, when Mr. Darton dropped hiscompanion's hand, led the horse aside, and came to greet hisbetrothed and Mrs. Hall.</p> 
<p>　　'Ah!' he said, smiling--with something like forced composure--'thisis a roundabout way of arriving, you will say, my dear Mrs. Hall.</p> 
<p>　　But we lost our way, which made us late. I saw a light here, andled in my horse at once--my friend Johns and my man have gone backto the little inn with theirs, not to crowd you too much. No soonerhad I entered than I saw that this lady had taken temporary shelterhere--and found I was intruding.'</p> 
<p>　　'She is my daughter-in-law,' said Mrs. Hall calmly. 'My son, too,is in the house, but he has gone to bed unwell.'</p> 
<p>　　Sally had stood staring wonderingly at the scene until this moment,hardly recognizing Darton's shake of the hand. The spell that boundher was broken by her perceiving the two little children seated on aheap of hay. She suddenly went forward, spoke to them, and took oneon her arm and the other in her hand.</p> 
<p>　　'And two children?' said Mr. Darton, showing thus that he had notbeen there long enough as yet to understand the situation.</p> 
<p>　　'My grandchildren,' said Mrs. Hall, with as much affected ease asbefore.</p> 
<p>　　Philip Hall's wife, in spite of this interruption to her firstrencounter, seemed scarcely so much affected by it as to feel anyone's presence in addition to Mr. Darton's. However, arousingherself by a quick reflection, she threw a sudden critical glance ofher sad eyes upon Mrs. Hall; and, apparently finding hersatisfactory, advanced to her in a meek initiative. Then Sally andthe stranger spoke some friendly words to each other, and Sally wenton with the children into the house. Mrs. Hall and Helena followed,and Mr. Darton followed these, looking at Helena's dress andoutline, and listening to her voice like a man in a dream.</p> 
<p>　　By the time the others reached the house Sally had already goneupstairs with the tired children. She rapped against the wall forRebekah to come in and help to attend to them, Rebekah's house beinga little 'spit-and-dab' cabin leaning against the substantial stone-work of Mrs. Hall's taller erection. When she came a bed was madeup for the little ones, and some supper given to them. Ondescending the stairs after seeing this done Sally went to thesitting-room. Young Mrs. Hall entered it just in advance of her,having in the interim retired with her mother-in-law to take off herbonnet, and otherwise make herself presentable. Hence it wasevident that no further communication could have passed between herand Mr. Darton since their brief interview in the stable.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Japheth Johns now opportunely arrived, and broke up therestraint of the company, after a few orthodox meteorologicalcommentaries had passed between him and Mrs. Hall by way ofintroduction. They at once sat down to supper, the present of wineand turkey not being produced for consumption to-night, lest thepremature display of those gifts should seem to throw doubt on Mrs.</p> 
<p>　　Hall's capacities as a provider.</p> 
<p>　　'Drink hearty, Mr. Johns--drink hearty,' said that matronmagnanimously. 'Such as it is there's plenty of. But perhapscider-wine is not to your taste?--though there's body in it.'</p> 
<p>　　'Quite the contrairy, ma'am--quite the contrairy,' said thedairyman. 'For though I inherit the malt-liquor principle from myfather, I am a cider-drinker on my mother's side. She came fromthese parts, you know. And there's this to be said for't--'tis amore peaceful liquor, and don't lie about a man like your hotterdrinks. With care, one may live on it a twelvemonth withoutknocking down a neighbour, or getting a black eye from an oldacquaintance.'</p> 
<p>　　The general conversation thus begun was continued briskly, though itwas in the main restricted to Mrs. Hall and Japheth, who in truthrequired but little help from anybody. There being slight call uponSally's tongue, she had ample leisure to do what her heart mostdesired, namely, watch her intended husband and her sister-in-lawwith a view of elucidating the strange momentary scene in which hermother and herself had surprised them in the stable. If that scenemeant anything, it meant, at least, that they had met before. Thatthere had been no time for explanations Sally could see, for theirmanner was still one of suppressed amazement at each other'spresence there. Darton's eyes, too, fell continually on the gownworn by Helena as if this were an added riddle to his perplexity;though to Sally it was the one feature in the case which was nomystery. He seemed to feel that fate had impishly changed his vis-a-vis in the lover's jig he was about to foot; that while the gownhad been expected to enclose a Sally, a Helena's face looked outfrom the bodice; that some long-lost hand met his own from thesleeves.</p> 
<p>　　Sally could see that whatever Helena might know of Darton, she knewnothing of how the dress entered into his embarrassment. And atmoments the young girl would have persuaded herself that Darton'slooks at her sister-in-law were entirely the fruit of the clothesquery. But surely at other times a more extensive range ofspeculation and sentiment was expressed by her lover's eye than thatwhich the changed dress would account for.</p> 
<p>　　Sally's independence made her one of the least jealous of women.</p> 
<p>　　But there was something in the relations of these two visitors whichought to be explained.</p> 
<p>　　Japheth Johns continued to converse in his well-known style,interspersing his talk with some private reflections on the positionof Darton and Sally, which, though the sparkle in his eye showedthem to be highly entertaining to himself, were apparently not quitecommunicable to the company. At last he withdrew for the night,going off to the roadside inn half-a-mile back, whither Dartonpromised to follow him in a few minutes.</p> 
<p>　　Half-an-hour passed, and then Mr. Darton also rose to leave, Sallyand her sister-in-law simultaneously wishing him good-night as theyretired upstairs to their rooms. But on his arriving at the frontdoor with Mrs. Hall a sharp shower of rain began to come down, whenthe widow suggested that he should return to the fire-side till thestorm ceased.</p> 
<p>　　Darton accepted her proposal, but insisted that, as it was gettinglate, and she was obviously tired, she should not sit up on hisaccount, since he could let himself out of the house, and wouldquite enjoy smoking a pipe by the hearth alone. Mrs. Hall assented;and Darton was left by himself. He spread his knees to the brands,lit up his tobacco as he had said, and sat gazing into the fire, andat the notches of the chimney-crook which hung above.</p> 
<p>　　An occasional drop of rain rolled down the chimney with a hiss, andstill he smoked on; but not like a man whose mind was at rest. Inthe long run, however, despite his meditations, early hours afieldand a long ride in the open air produced their natural result. Hebegan to doze.</p> 
<p>　　How long he remained in this half-unconscious state he did not know.</p> 
<p>　　He suddenly opened his eyes. The back-brand had burnt itself intwo, and ceased to flame; the light which he had placed on themantelpiece had nearly gone out. But in spite of these deficienciesthere was a light in the apartment, and it came from elsewhere.</p> 
<p>　　Turning his head he saw Philip Hall's wife standing at the entranceof the room with a bed-candle in one hand, a small brass tea-kettlein the other, and HIS gown, as it certainly seemed, still upon her.</p> 
<p>　　'Helena!' said Darton, starting up.</p> 
<p>　　Her countenance expressed dismay, and her first words were anapology. 'I--did not know you were here, Mr. Darton,' she said,while a blush flashed to her cheek. 'I thought every one hadretired--I was coming to make a little water boil; my husband seemsto be worse. But perhaps the kitchen fire can be lighted up again.'</p> 
<p>　　'Don't go on my account. By all means put it on here as youintended,' said Darton. 'Allow me to help you.' He went forward totake the kettle from her hand, but she did not allow him, and placedit on the fire herself.</p> 
<p>　　They stood some way apart, one on each side of the fireplace,waiting till the water should boil, the candle on the mantel betweenthem, and Helena with her eyes on the kettle. Darton was the firstto break the silence. 'Shall I call Sally?' he said.</p> 
<p>　　'O no,' she quickly returned. 'We have given trouble enoughalready. We have no right here. But we are the sport of fate, andwere obliged to come.'</p> 
<p>　　'No right here!' said he in surprise.</p> 
<p>　　'None. I can't explain it now,' answered Helena. 'This kettle isvery slow.'</p> 
<p>　　There was another pause; the proverbial dilatoriness of watched potswas never more clearly exemplified.</p> 
<p>　　Helena's face was of that sort which seems to ask for assistancewithout the owner's knowledge--the very antipodes of Sally's, whichwas self-reliance expressed. Darton's eyes travelled from thekettle to Helena's face, then back to the kettle, then to the facefor rather a longer time. 'So I am not to know anything of themystery that has distracted me all the evening?' he said. 'How isit that a woman, who refused me because (as I supposed) my positionwas not good enough for her taste, is found to be the wife of a manwho certainly seems to be worse off than I?'</p> 
<p>　　'He had the prior claim,' said she.</p> 
<p>　　'What! you knew him at that time?'</p> 
<p>　　'Yes, yes! Please say no more,' she implored.</p> 
<p>　　'Whatever my errors, I have paid for them during the last fiveyears!'</p> 
<p>　　The heart of Darton was subject to sudden overflowings. He was kindto a fault. 'I am sorry from my soul,' he said, involuntarilyapproaching her. Helena withdrew a step or two, at which he becameconscious of his movement, and quickly took his former place. Herehe stood without speaking, and the little kettle began to sing.</p> 
<p>　　'Well, you might have been my wife if you had chosen,' he said atlast. 'But that's all past and gone. However, if you are in anytrouble or poverty I shall be glad to be of service, and as yourrelation by marriage I shall have a right to be. Does your uncleknow of your distress?'</p> 
<p>　　'My uncle is dead. He left me without a farthing. And now we havetwo children to maintain.'</p> 
<p>　　'What, left you nothing? How could he be so cruel as that?'</p> 
<p>　　'I disgraced myself in his eyes.'</p> 
<p>　　'Now,' said Darton earnestly, 'let me take care of the children, atleast while you are so unsettled. YOU belong to another, so Icannot take care of you.'</p> 
<p>　　'Yes you can,' said a voice; and suddenly a third figure stoodbeside them. It was Sally. 'You can, since you seem to wish to?'</p> 
<p>　　she repeated. 'She no longer belongs to another . . . My poorbrother is dead!'</p> 
<p>　　Her face was red, her eyes sparkled, and all the woman came to thefront. 'I have heard it!' she went on to him passionately. 'Youcan protect her now as well as the children!' She turned then toher agitated sister-in-law. 'I heard something,' said Sally (in agentle murmur, differing much from her previous passionate words),'and I went into his room. It must have been the moment you left.</p> 
<p>　　He went off so quickly, and weakly, and it was so unexpected, that Icouldn't leave even to call you.'</p> 
<p>　　Darton was just able to gather from the confused discourse whichfollowed that, during his sleep by the fire, this brother whom hehad never seen had become worse; and that during Helena's absencefor water the end had unexpectedly come. The two young womenhastened upstairs, and he was again left alone.</p> 
<p>　　After standing there a short time he went to the front door andlooked out; till, softly closing it behind him, he advanced andstood under the large sycamore-tree. The stars were flickeringcoldly, and the dampness which had just descended upon the earth inrain now sent up a chill from it. Darton was in a strange position,and he felt it. The unexpected appearance, in deep poverty, ofHelena--a young lady, daughter of a deceased naval officer, who hadbeen brought up by her uncle, a solicitor, and had refused Darton inmarriage years ago--the passionate, almost angry demeanour of Sallyat discovering them, the abrupt announcement that Helena was awidow; all this coming together was a conjuncture difficult to copewith in a moment, and made him question whether he ought to leavethe house or offer assistance. But for Sally's manner he wouldunhesitatingly have done the latter.</p> 
<p>　　He was still standing under the tree when the door in front of himopened, and Mrs. Hall came out. She went round to the garden-gateat the side without seeing him. Darton followed her, intending tospeak.</p> 
<p>　　Pausing outside, as if in thought, she proceeded to a spot where thesun came earliest in spring-time, and where the north wind neverblew; it was where the row of beehives stood under the wall.</p> 
<p>　　Discerning her object, he waited till she had accomplished it.</p> 
<p>　　It was the universal custom thereabout to wake the bees by tappingat their hives whenever a death occurred in the household, under thebelief that if this were not done the bees themselves would pineaway and perish during the ensuing year. As soon as an interiorbuzzing responded to her tap at the first hive Mrs. Hall went on tothe second, and thus passed down the row. As soon as she came backhe met her.</p> 
<p>　　'What can I do in this trouble, Mrs. Hall?' he said.</p> 
<p>　　'O--nothing, thank you, nothing,' she said in a tearful voice, nowjust perceiving him. 'We have called Rebekah and her husband, andthey will do everything necessary.' She told him in a few words theparticulars of her son's arrival, broken in health--indeed, atdeath's very door, though they did not suspect it--and suggested, asthe result of a conversation between her and her daughter, that thewedding should be postponed.</p> 
<p>　　'Yes, of course,' said Darton. 'I think now to go straight to theinn and tell Johns what has happened.' It was not till after he hadshaken hands with her that he turned hesitatingly and added, 'Willyou tell the mother of his children that, as they are now leftfatherless, I shall be glad to take the eldest of them, if it wouldbe any convenience to her and to you?'</p> 
<p>　　Mrs. Hall promised that her son's widow should he told of the offer,and they parted. He retired down the rooty slope and disappeared inthe direction of the inn, where he informed Johns of thecircumstances. Meanwhile Mrs. Hall had entered the house, Sally wasdownstairs in the sitting-room alone, and her mother explained toher that Darton had readily assented to the postponement.</p> 
<p>　　'No doubt he has,' said Sally, with sad emphasis. 'It is not putoff for a week, or a month, or a year. I shall never marry him, andshe will!'</p>
