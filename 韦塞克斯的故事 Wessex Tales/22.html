Along a part of its course it connects with Long-Ash Lane, a monotonous track without a village or hamlet for manymiles, and with very seldom a turning. Unapprized wayfarers who aretoo old, or too young, or in other respects too weak for thedistance to be traversed, but who, nevertheless, have to walk it,say, as they look wistfully ahead, 'Once at the top of that hill,and I must surely see the end of Long-Ash Lane!' But they reach thehilltop, and Long-Ash Lane stretches in front as mercilessly asbefore.</p> 
<p>　　Some few years ago a certain farmer was riding through this lane inthe gloom of a winter evening. The farmer's friend, a dairyman, wasriding beside him. A few paces in the rear rode the farmer's man.</p> 
<p>　　All three were well horsed on strong, round-barrelled cobs; and tobe well horsed was to be in better spirits about Long-Ash Lane thanpoor pedestrians could attain to during its passage.</p> 
<p>　　But the farmer did not talk much to his friend as he rode along.</p> 
<p>　　The enterprise which had brought him there filled his mind; for intruth it was important. Not altogether so important was it,perhaps, when estimated by its value to society at large; but if thetrue measure of a deed be proportionate to the space it occupies inthe heart of him who undertakes it, Farmer Charles Darton's businessto-night could hold its own with the business of kings.</p> 
<p>　　He was a large farmer. His turnover, as it is called, was probablythirty thousand pounds a year. He had a great many draught horses,a great many milch cows, and of sheep a multitude. This comfortableposition was, however, none of his own making. It had been createdby his father, a man of a very different stamp from the presentrepresentative of the line.</p> 
<p>　　Darton, the father, had been a one-idea'd character, with abuttoned-up pocket and a chink-like eye brimming with commercialsubtlety. In Darton the son, this trade subtlety had becometransmuted into emotional, and the harshness had disappeared; hewould have been called a sad man but for his constant care not todivide himself from lively friends by piping notes out of harmonywith theirs. Contemplative, he allowed his mind to be a quietmeeting-place for memories and hopes. So that, naturally enough,since succeeding to the agricultural calling, and up to his presentage of thirty-two, he had neither advanced nor receded as acapitalist--a stationary result which did not agitate one of hisunambitious, unstrategic nature, since he had all that he desired.</p> 
<p>　　The motive of his expedition tonight showed the same absence ofanxious regard for Number One.</p> 
<p>　　The party rode on in the slow, safe trot proper to night-time andbad roads, Farmer Darton's head jigging rather unromantically up anddown against the sky, and his motions being repeated with bolderemphasis by his friend Japheth Johns; while those of the latter weretravestied in jerks still less softened by art in the person of thelad who attended them. A pair of whitish objects hung one on eachside of the latter, bumping against him at each step, and stillfurther spoiling the grace of his seat. On close inspection theymight have been perceived to be open rush baskets--one containing aturkey, and the other some bottles of wine.</p> 
<p>　　'D'ye feel ye can meet your fate like a man, neighbour Darton?'</p> 
<p>　　asked Johns, breaking a silence which had lasted while five-and-twenty hedgerow trees had glided by.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Darton with a half-laugh murmured, 'Ay--call it my fate!</p> 
<p>　　Hanging and wiving go by destiny.' And then they were silent again.</p> 
<p>　　The darkness thickened rapidly, at intervals shutting down on theland in a perceptible flap, like the wave of a wing. The customaryclose of day was accelerated by a simultaneous blurring of the air.</p> 
<p>　　With the fall of night had come a mist just damp enough toincommode, but not sufficient to saturate them. Countrymen as theywere--born, as may be said, with only an open door between them andthe four seasons--they regarded the mist but as an addedobscuration, and ignored its humid quality.</p> 
<p>　　They were travelling in a direction that was enlivened by no moderncurrent of traffic, the place of Darton's pilgrimage being an old-fashioned village--one of the Hintocks (several villages of thatname, with a distinctive prefix or affix, lying thereabout)--wherethe people make the best cider and cider-wine in all Wessex, andwhere the dunghills smell of pomace instead of stable refuse aselsewhere. The lane was sometimes so narrow that the brambles ofthe hedge, which hung forward like anglers' rods over a stream,scratched their hats and curry-combed their whiskers as they passed.</p> 
<p>　　Yet this neglected lane had been a highway to Queen Elizabeth'ssubjects and the cavalcades of the past. Its day was over now, andits history as a national artery done for ever.</p> 
<p>　　'Why I have decided to marry her,' resumed Darton (in a measuredmusical voice of confidence which revealed a good deal of hiscomposition), as he glanced round to see that the lad was not toonear, 'is not only that I like her, but that I can do no better,even from a fairly practical point of view. That I might ha' lookedhigher is possibly true, though it is really all nonsense. I havehad experience enough in looking above me. "No more superior womenfor me," said I--you know when. Sally is a comely, independent,simple character, with no make-up about her, who'll think me as mucha superior to her as I used to think--you know who I mean--was tome.'</p> 
<p>　　'Ay,' said Johns. 'However, I shouldn't call Sally Hall simple.</p> 
<p>　　Primary, because no Sally is; secondary, because if some could be,this one wouldn't. 'Tis a wrong denomination to apply to a woman,Charles, and affects me, as your best man, like cold water. 'Tislike recommending a stage play by saying there's neither murder,villainy, nor harm of any sort in it, when that's what you've paidyour half-crown to see.'</p> 
<p>　　'Well; may your opinion do you good. Mine's a different one.' Andturning the conversation from the philosophical to the practical,Darton expressed a hope that the said Sally had received what he'dsent on by the carrier that day.</p> 
<p>　　Johns wanted to know what that was.</p> 
<p>　　'It is a dress,' said Darton. 'Not exactly a wedding-dress; thoughshe may use it as one if she likes. It is rather serviceable thanshowy--suitable for the winter weather.'</p> 
<p>　　'Good,' said Johns. 'Serviceable is a wise word in a bridegroom. Icommend ye, Charles.'</p> 
<p>　　'For,' said Darton, 'why should a woman dress up like a rope-dancerbecause she's going to do the most solemn deed of her life exceptdying?'</p> 
<p>　　'Faith, why? But she will, because she will, I suppose,' saidDairyman Johns.</p> 
<p>　　'H'm,' said Darton.</p> 
<p>　　The lane they followed had been nearly straight for several miles,but it now took a turn, and winding uncertainly for some distanceforked into two. By night country roads are apt to reveal ungainlyqualities which pass without observation during day; and thoughDarton had travelled this way before, he had not done so frequently,Sally having been wooed at the house of a relative near his own. Henever remembered seeing at this spot a pair of alternative wayslooking so equally probable as these two did now. Johns rode on afew steps.</p> 
<p>　　'Don't be out of heart, sonny,' he cried. 'Here's a handpost.</p> 
<p>　　Enoch--come and climm this post, and tell us the way.'</p> 
<p>　　The lad dismounted, and jumped into the hedge where the post stoodunder a tree.</p> 
<p>　　'Unstrap the baskets, or you'll smash up that wine!' cried Darton,as the young man began spasmodically to climb the post, baskets andall.</p> 
<p>　　'Was there ever less head in a brainless world?' said Johns. 'Here,simple Nocky, I'll do it.' He leapt off, and with much puffingclimbed the post, striking a match when he reached the top, andmoving the light along the arm, the lad standing and gazing at thespectacle.</p> 
<p>　　'I have faced tantalization these twenty years with a temper as mildas milk!' said Japheth; 'but such things as this don't come short ofdevilry!' And flinging the match away, he slipped down to theground.</p> 
<p>　　'What's the matter?' asked Darton.</p> 
<p>　　'Not a letter, sacred or heathen--not so much as would tell us theway to the great fireplace--ever I should sin to say it! Either themoss and mildew have eat away the words, or we have arrived in aland where the natyves have lost the art o' writing, and should ha'</p> 
<p>　　brought our compass like Christopher Columbus.'</p> 
<p>　　'Let us take the straightest road,' said Darton placidly; 'I shan'tbe sorry to get there--'tis a tiresome ride. I would have driven ifI had known.'</p> 
<p>　　'Nor I neither, sir,' said Enoch. 'These straps plough my shoulderlike a zull. If 'tis much further to your lady's home, MaisterDarton, I shall ask to be let carry half of these good things in myinnerds--hee, hee!'</p> 
<p>　　'Don't you be such a reforming radical, Enoch,' said Johns sternly.</p> 
<p>　　'Here, I'll take the turkey.'</p> 
<p>　　This being done, they went forward by the right-hand lane, whichascended a hill, the left winding away under a plantation. The pit-a-pat of their horses' hoofs lessened up the slope; and the ironicaldirecting-post stood in solitude as before, holding out its blankarms to the raw breeze, which brought a snore from the wood as ifSkrymir the Giant were sleeping there.</p>
