Itwas nearly dark, but the shutters were not yet closed, nor thecandles lighted; and Stockdale was tempted to stretch his headtowards the window. He saw outside the door a young man in clothesof a whitish colour, and upon reflection judged their wearer to bethe well-built and rather handsome miller who lived below. Themiller's voice was alternately low and firm, and sometimes itreached the level of positive entreaty; but what the words wereStockdale could in no way hear.</p> 
<p>　　Before the colloquy had ended, the minister's attention wasattracted by a second incident. Opposite Lizzy's home grew a clumpof laurels, forming a thick and permanent shade. One of the laurelboughs now quivered against the light background of sky, and in amoment the head of a man peered out, and remained still. He seemedto be also much interested in the conversation at the door, and wasplainly lingering there to watch and listen. Had Stockdale stood inany other relation to Lizzy than that of a lover, he might have goneout and investigated the meaning of this: but being as yet but anunprivileged ally, he did nothing more than stand up and showhimself against the firelight, whereupon the listener disappeared,and Lizzy and the miller spoke in lower tones.</p> 
<p>　　Stockdale was made so uneasy by the circumstance, that as soon asthe miller was gone, he said, 'Mrs. Newberry, are you aware that youwere watched just now, and your conversation heard?'</p> 
<p>　　'When?' she said.</p> 
<p>　　'When you were talking to that miller. A man was looking from thelaurel-tree as jealously as if he could have eaten you.'</p> 
<p>　　She showed more concern than the trifling event seemed to demand,and he added, 'Perhaps you were talking of things you did not wishto be overheard?'</p> 
<p>　　'I was talking only on business,' she said.</p> 
<p>　　'Lizzy, be frank!' said the young man. 'If it was only on business,why should anybody wish to listen to you?'</p> 
<p>　　She looked curiously at him. 'What else do you think it could be,then?'</p> 
<p>　　'Well--the only talk between a young woman and man that is likely toamuse an eavesdropper.'</p> 
<p>　　'Ah yes,' she said, smiling in spite of her preoccupation. 'Well,my cousin Owlett has spoken to me about matrimony, every now andthen, that's true; but he was not speaking of it then. I wish hehad been speaking of it, with all my heart. It would have been muchless serious for me.'</p> 
<p>　　'O Mrs. Newberry!'</p> 
<p>　　'It would. Not that I should ha' chimed in with him, of course. Iwish it for other reasons. I am glad, Mr. Stockdale, that you havetold me of that listener. It is a timely warning, and I must see mycousin again.'</p> 
<p>　　'But don't go away till I have spoken,' said the minister. 'I'llout with it at once, and make no more ado. Let it be Yes or Nobetween us, Lizzy; please do!' And he held out his hand, in whichshe freely allowed her own to rest, but without speaking.</p> 
<p>　　'You mean Yes by that?' he asked, after waiting a while.</p> 
<p>　　'You may be my sweetheart, if you will.'</p> 
<p>　　'Why not say at once you will wait for me until I have a house andcan come back to marry you.'</p> 
<p>　　'Because I am thinking--thinking of something else,' she said withembarrassment. 'It all comes upon me at once, and I must settle onething at a time.'</p> 
<p>　　'At any rate, dear Lizzy, you can assure me that the miller shallnot be allowed to speak to you except on business? You have neverdirectly encouraged him?'</p> 
<p>　　She parried the question by saying, 'You see, he and his party havebeen in the habit of leaving things on my premises sometimes, and asI have not denied him, it makes him rather forward.'</p> 
<p>　　'Things--what things?'</p> 
<p>　　'Tubs--they are called Things here.'</p> 
<p>　　'But why don't you deny him, my dear Lizzy?'</p> 
<p>　　'I cannot well.'</p> 
<p>　　'You are too timid. It is unfair of him to impose so upon you, andget your good name into danger by his smuggling tricks. Promise methat the next time he wants to leave his tubs here you will let meroll them into the street?'</p> 
<p>　　She shook her head. 'I would not venture to offend the neighboursso much as that,' said she, 'or do anything that would be so likelyto put poor Owlett into the hands of the excisemen.'</p> 
<p>　　Stockdale sighed, and said that he thought hers a mistakengenerosity when it extended to assisting those who cheated the kingof his dues. 'At any rate, you will let me make him keep hisdistance as your lover, and tell him flatly that you are not forhim?'</p> 
<p>　　'Please not, at present,' she said. 'I don't wish to offend my oldneighbours. It is not only Owlett who is concerned.'</p> 
<p>　　'This is too bad,' said Stockdale impatiently.</p> 
<p>　　'On my honour, I won't encourage him as my lover,' Lizzy answeredearnestly. 'A reasonable man will be satisfied with that.'</p> 
<p>　　'Well, so I am,' said Stockdale, his countenance clearing.</p>
