You'd say he had something more than a nervous breakdown, if you saw him. He's bony and frail under his ton of make-up.</p> 
<p>'Marion Nuckles,' says the prosecutor. 'Can you identify Vernon Gregory Little in the courtroom?'</p> 
<p>Nuckles's sunken eyes worm through the room. They stop at my cage. Then, as if against a hurricane wind, he raises a finger to me.</p> 
<p>'Let the record show the witness has identified the defendant. Mister Nuckles, can you confirm you were the defendant's class teacher between ten and eleven o'clock on the morning of Tuesday, May twentieth, this year?'</p> 
<p>Nuckles's eyes swim without registering anything. He breaks into a sweat, and crumples over the railing of the witness box.</p> 
<p>'Your honor, I must protest,' says Brian, 'the witness is in no state …'</p> 
<p>'Shh!' says the judge. He watches Nuckles with razor eyes.</p> 
<p>'I was there,' says Nuckles. His lips tremble, he begins to cry.</p> 
<p>The judge flaps an urgent hand at the prosecutor. 'Get to the point!' he hisses.</p> 
<p>'Marion Nuckles, can you confirm that at some time during that hour you gave some notes to the defendant, written in your own hand, and sent him with them on an errand, outside the classroom?'</p> 
<p>'Yes, yes,' says Nuckles, shaking violently.</p> 
<p>'And what happened then?'</p> 
<p>Nuckles starts to dry retch over the railing. 'Scorned the love of Jesus - erased his perfume from across the land …'</p> 
<p>'Your honor, please,' shouts Brian.</p> 
<p>'Doused it all in the blood of babes …'</p> 
<p>The prosecutor hangs suspended in time, mouth open. 'What happened?' he shouts. 'What exactly did Vernon Little do?'</p> 
<p>'He killed them, killed them all …'</p> 
<p>Nuckles breaks into sobs, barks them like a wolf, and from my cage in the new world I bark sobs back, pelt them through the bars like bones. My sobs ring out through both summations, spray the journey to the cells behind the courthouse, and continue through a visit from an officer who tells me the jury has retired to a hotel to consider the matter of my life or death.</p> 
<p>Friday, twenty-first of November is a smoky day, tingling with a sense that solid matter can pass through you like air. I watch the jury foreman put on his glasses and lift a sheet of paper to his face. Mom couldn't make it today, but Pam came by with Vaine Gurie and Georgette Porkorney. Vaine is frowning, and seems a little slimmer. George's ole porcelain eyes roll around the room, she distracts herself with other thoughts. She trembles a little. You ain't allowed to smoke in here. And look at Pam. When I catch her eye, she makes a flurry of gestures that seem to describe us eating a hearty meal together, soon. I just look away.</p> 
<p>'Mr Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?'</p> 
<p>'We have, sir.'</p> 
<p>The court officer reads out the first charge to the jury. 'How do you find the defendant - guilty, or not guilty?'</p> 
<p>'Not guilty,' says the foreman.</p> 
<p>'On the second count of murder, that of Hiram Salazar in Lockhart, Texas - how do you find the defendant, guilty or not guilty?'</p> 
<p>'Not guilty.'</p> 
<p>My heart beats through five not guilties. Six, seven, nine, eleven. Seventeen not guilties. The prosecutor's lips curl. My attorney sits proud in his chair.</p> 
<p>'On the eighteenth count of murder in the first degree, that of Barry Enoch Gurie in Martirio, Texas - how do you find the defendant, guilty or not guilty?'</p> 
<p>'Not guilty,' says the foreman.</p> 
<p>The officer reads a list of my fallen school friends. The world holds its breath as he looks up to ask the verdict.</p> 
<p>The jury foreman's eyes twitch, then fall.</p> 
<p>'Guilty.'</p> 
<p>Even before he says it, I feel departments in the office of my life start to close up shop; files are shredded, sensitivities are folded into neatly marked boxes, lights and alarms are switched off. As the husk of my body is guided from the court, I sense a single little man sat at the bottom of my soul. He hunches over a card table under a naked low-watt bulb, sipping flat beer from a plastic cup. I figure he must be my janitor. I figure he must be me.</p>
