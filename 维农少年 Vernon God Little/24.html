We need to pick a shortlist of prisoners, advertise them well, then open the voting lines and see who performs.'</p> 
<p>It sounds like he's with at least three other men. The guard knocks urgently on our door, but doesn't open it, like he just wants us to shut up.</p> 
<p>'We have a hundred and fourteen ready to go,' says another man. 'You mean put up three dozen or so, for the first vote?'</p> 
<p>'Tch, no way. I mean put up two or three, at most. Flesh-out their characters for the audience, show interviews, reconstructions of their crimes, tears from the victims' families. Then give the candidates web-cam access for the last week, live to air - a head-to-head battle for sympathy.'</p> 
<p>'I see,' says the guy. 'Kinda Big Brother, huh?'</p> 
<p>'Precisely, just how we sold it to the sponsors.'</p> 
<p>'But how do we select the first two?' asks a third man.</p> 
<p>'It doesn't really matter, provided the crimes are strong enough. I heard a concept the other day that kind of interested me, though, I think it was on a game show or something - "The last shall go first," it said. Has a ring to it, don't you think?'</p> 
<p>'Nice,' says the fourth man. 'Top-of-mind recall.'</p> 
<p>'Precisely.'</p> 
<p>Their footsteps slow as they approach the cell, you hear the guard clink to attention.</p> 
<p>'Any reason for you to be down here, Officer?' asks Lally.</p> 
<p>The guard shuffles on the spot, then a shadow passes over the peephole. 'Open this door,' says Lally. The key turns, and he looks inside. 'What have we here?' He turns to the guard. 'Aren't the men supposed to be segregated?'</p> 
<p>'Oh sure, sure,' says the guard, fidgeting with his keys. 'It's just like, therapy, you know? A little counseling makes the living easier up on the Row.'</p> 
<p>Lally frowns. 'This boy is a mass-murderer - surely it's a little late for counseling. Anyway, these cells are out of bounds, we're installing sound post-production down here.'</p> 
<p>'How's your mama?' I ask Lally. The words skim from my lip like spit. 'Motherfucker.'</p> 
<p>'Jesus, kid!' chokes the guard.</p> 
<p>Lally stifles an impulse to lash me, his business cronies keep him chilled. I stare slow deaths at him. 'There ain't prayers enough in heaven to stop me paying your fucken ass back,' I hear myself whisper. Even Lasalle recoils.</p> 
<p>Lally just smirks. 'Break them up.'</p> 
<p>'Yes, sir,' says the guard. He straightens, and waves an angry hand at Lasalle and me. I try to catch Lasalle's eyes, but he just shuffles away.</p> 
<p>'Lasalle - what's the secret?' I hiss after him.</p> 
<p>'Later, kid, later.'</p> 
<p>Lally smiles at me as I leave the room. 'Still trying to figure things out, eh, Little man?' He gives an asthma laugh, then his voice folds into echoes as he leads his men away. 'So, February fourteenth we launch the first vote.'</p> 
<p>'You mean Valentine's Day?' asks another man.</p> 
<p>'Precisely.'</p> 
<p>Guess what: you can receive junk-mail on Death Row. The week before the first vote I get a sweepstakes letter that says I definitely won a million dollars; at least that's what it says on the envelope. I think you have to buy encyclopedias to get it or something, or to maybe get it. I also find a Bar-B-Chew Barn token entitling me to a Chik'n'Mix for two, at any of their branches across the State. Yeah, they're across the State now. Tomorrow the world, I guess.</p> 
<p>I'm working on my art project when I hear Jonesy making his way down the Row towards me. Banter from the other cells lets you know where he is. He's bringing the phone. I stiffen, and stash away my art stuff. As it happens though, the big news reaches me before Jonesy arrives with the phone. I hear it from a TV up the Row.</p> 
<p>' … The body of the American will be flown home today. Forty refugees also died in the skirmish,' says the news. 'After the break - the end of the road for serial killer Vernon Gregory Little; we'll have the latest on that failed appeal, and also - the duck and the hamster that just won't take no for an answer!'</p> 
<p>Jones doesn't look at me, he just passes me the phone. 'Vernon, I'm sorry,' my attorney crackles through the receiver. 'I don't have the words to tell you how I feel.'</p> 
<p>I just stay quiet.</p> 
<p>'There's nothing more we can do.'</p> 
<p>'What about the Supreme Court?' I ask.</p> 
<p>'In your case, I'm afraid the fast-track process puts that option out of our reach. I'm sorry …'</p> 
<p>I put the phone down on my bunk, hearing every crease of the blanket like gravel in my ears.</p> 
<p>Tonight they install cameras in my cell, and remove all the TVs and radios from the Row. We ain't allowed to see how the voting's going, that's why. I just sit quiet in the darkest corner and think about things, I don't even play with the clacking balls. Eight squillion valentines turned up for me, from sickos all over the world. Somebody in the mail room was kind enough to just send up the one from Ella Bouchard. I left her on my mail list, don't ask me why. I don't open it, though. The Row is extra-quiet tonight, out of respect, I guess. They're called the worst in the land, but my Row mates know something about respect.</p> 
<p>I need another date with Lasalle. As the first public vote gets underway, I find myself thinking hard on some of that stuff he said. Not that it made a whole lot of sense, back when I had a chance to live. But it laid an egg in my mind that started growing. Face my God. In between trading junk-mail, the other cons get talking about this week's public vote, laying bets who'll be first to go. That's what they do in between griping for their TVs and radios. They don't bet on anyone from this Row, but you know the feeling of being the last one in the dentist's waiting-room? That's me right now. The problem with the voting is that you don't get to hear if it's you until the last day. You have to stay prepared. Sometimes I get grand schemes to be wacky for my execution, wear socks on my ears or something, or say something bizarre for my last statement. Then I just bawl a little. These days I'm bawling way too much really, for a man, I know it.</p> 
<p>By the last day of voting, I can't bear it anymore. In an hour the world will know who's going to die. I bitch to Jonesy about some more time with Lasalle, but he ain't interested. He argues with another guard over who gets to mind the governor's phone-line in the execution chamber, for the first executions. Occasionally he snaps down the Row at me.</p> 
<p>'Mr Laid-his-ma ordered no more visits,' he says. 'Anyway, in a while you mayn't have to worry about nothin no more.'</p> 
<p>In the end I take up clacking the metal balls again, until the other cons join in griping. All it does is ruffle Jonesy's feathers. 'Which one a you fucks got a million bucks to pay for special favors?'</p> 
<p>'Git outta here,' yell the cons.</p> 
<p>I just sigh. The swirl of musty air rustles a paper on my bench. An idea rustles with it. 'Jonesy,' I say, gabbing the sweepstakes letter. 'Here's your million.'</p> 
<p>'Yeah, right,' he says.</p> 
<p>'I ain't fooling - look,' I hold up the envelope.</p> 
<p>'You think I was born yesterday?' snorts Jonesy. 'I just about have to shovel that mail-order fuckin bullshit off my driveway every mornin.'</p> 
<p>I try a hooshy laugh on him. 'We-ell,' I hoosh. 'O-kay - but this is a legally binding promise for a million bucks - you know they can't say it unless it's true, and they say it right here in red and white.'</p> 
<p>'Hey, Little!' calls a con. 'You sayin you got the latest sweepstakes letter?'</p> 
<p>'That's right.'</p> 
<p>'Does it have black writin on it, or red writin?'</p> 
<p>'It's the red one, all right.'</p> 
<p>'God, Jesus in Heaven - I'll give you two hundred for that letter,' he says.</p> 
<p>'Lemme see that,' Jonesy snatches the letter through my grille. He studies it a second, then says, 'It's got your name on it, that ain't no good to me.'</p> 
<p>'Officer Jones,' I say, like a schoolteacher or something, 'my execution-kit has a last will and testament in it - I can leave it to you, see?'</p> 
<p>'Little, wait!' yells another con. 'I'll give you three hundred for that letter.'</p> 
<p>'Fuck that,' hollers another, 'I'll make it five!'</p> 
<p>'Pipe the fuck down,' shouts Jonesy. 'Didn't y'all hear he gave it to me?' He checks his watch, then points through the grille at my slippers. 'Get ready.'</p> 
<p>When the clinking of his keychain is out of earshot, a giggle flutters along the Row. 'Hrr-hrr-hr, fuckin Jonesy,' go the cons.</p> 
<p>'Little,' says the con next door. 'You finally learnin how to git along.'</p> 
<p>Officer Jones personally marches me along the Row, and down the stairs to find Lasalle. We have to sidestep a porter pushing a trolley loaded with TVs and radios on their way back to the cells. That means the vote is over. Behind the appliances struts the dark-suited man with the execution papers. It's his job to deliver the papers to the head warden of a Row, so that he can deliver them to the condemned man. As the suited man passes, I see Jonesy flash him an eyebrow, almost imperceptibly. The man just as imperceptibly shakes his head, and walks right on by.</p> 
<p>'None of my boys dyin today,' says Jones. My gut relaxes. I live again, for now. When we reach the floor below, a different floor this time, Jones sticks his head into a regular-looking room, but nobody's there. He calls to a guard up the Row.</p> 
<p>'Lasalle around?'</p> 
<p>'In the cans,' says the guard, 'takin a dump.'</p> 
<p>Jonesy takes me to the shower block on the floor below, and marches me right inside.</p> 
<p>'Ain't we gonna wait for him to come out?' I ask.</p> 
<p>'No time - it's execution day, I have to get downstairs. You got five minutes.' He casts a shifty eye around, then he leaves me with this echoey drip of brown-sounding water, and goes to stand outside the door.</p> 
<p>I crouch on the wet concrete floor, and scan under the cubicles for evidence of life. Two cubicle doors are shut, not that you can lock them or anything. Under one door hangs a pair of jail slippers, and regular jail pants. Under the other is a pair of polished black shoes, and blue suit pants. I knock on that cubicle.</p> 
<p>'Lasalle - it's Vern.'</p> 
<p>'Aw Jesus. What you think I can do for you from a prison fuckin toilet?'</p> 
<p>'Uh - help me face my God.' I hoosh it ironically. I guess it's ironic, hooshing when you're in the prison shithouse on some poor bastard's execution day.</p> 
<p>'Shit,' he gripes.</p> 
<p>Everybody's tense today, see. Tension even buzzes through this can door, like we just met in the freezer section of Death-Mart or something. Waves rise to engulf me.</p> 
<p>'Really wanna meet you God?' says Lasalle. 'Then git on you damn fuckin knees.'</p> 
<p>'Uh - it's kinda wet out here, actually, Lasalle …'</p> 
<p>'Then make a fuckin wish to Santa. Ask for what you most want in this damn world.'</p> 
<p>I think for a second, mostly wondering if I should just leave. Then, after a moment, I hear Lasalle's clothes rustle inside the cubicle. The toilet flushes. He opens the door. His ole turkey neck appears, poking out of a collar and tie. His bottom lip juts dumb.</p> 
<p>'Well?' he says, looking around. 'You a free man?' I look around, like a dumbo, while he straightens his tie, and raises a polite hand to the door. 'Officer Jones,' he calls, 'any news on the boy's pardon?' Jonesy just laughs, a real dirty laugh. Lasalle glares at me. 'So much for fuckin Santa.'</p> 
<p>'Some preacher you are,' I say. I turn for the door but he grips my arm and spins me around. One tubular vein stands out from his neck, throbbing like it lives on a reproductive organ.</p> 
<p>'Blind, dumb shit,' he spits, his breath like hot sandpaper in my ear. 'Where's this God you talk about? You think a caring intelligence would wipe out babies from hunger, watch decent folk scream and burn and bleed every second of the day and night? That ain't no God. Just fuckin people. You stuck with the rest of us in this snake-pit of human wants, wants frustrated and calcified into needs, achin and raw.'</p> 
<p>The outburst takes me aback. 'Everybody needs something,' I mutter.</p> 
<p>'Then don't come cryin to me becausen you got in the way of another man's needs.'</p> 
<p>'But, Lasalle …'</p> 
<p>'Why you think the world chewin its own legs off? Becausen the goodies are right there, but we can't fuckin get 'em. Why can't we get 'em? Becausen the market for promises need us not to. That ain't the work of no God. That's human work, animals who dreamed up an outside God to take the heat.' Lasalle pokes a trembling lip at my face. 'Wise the fuck up. Intermingling needs make this world go round. Serve that intermingling, and you needs can get fulfilled. Ever hear say, "Give the people what they want?"'</p> 
<p>'Sure, but - where's that leave God?'</p> 
<p>'Boy you really missed the boat. I'll make it simple, so's even fuckin you can understand. Papa God growed us up till we could wear long pants; then he licensed his name to dollar bills, left some car keys on the table, and got the fuck outta town.' Water rushes to his eye-holes. 'Don't be lookin up at no sky for help. Look down here, at us twisted dreamers.' He takes hold of my shoulders, spins me around, and punches me towards the mirror on the wall. 'You're the God. Take responsibility. Exercise your power.'</p> 
<p>Four men appear at the door: two guards, a chaplain, and the guy in the dark suit. 'Time for the final event,' says the suit.</p> 
<p>My eyes snap to the cubicle where the other prisoner takes a quiet dump, but the men walk right past it and grab hold of Lasalle. His lip juts dumb again, his shoulders droop. Through the corner of my eye I see Jonesy calling me out.</p> 
<p>'Lasalle? You a con?' I ask.</p> 
<p>'Not for long,' he says softly. 'Looks like not for long.'</p> 
<p>'C'mon, Little,' calls Jones from the door. 'Lasalle won the first vote.'</p> 
<p>'But Lasalle, was that like - the secret of life?'</p> 
<p>He tuts and shakes his head as the group march him to the door.</p> 
<p>'I mean - what's the practical …?'</p> 
<p>He holds a hand up to the guards. They stop. 'You mean, how do you do it? Big yourself up - watch any animal for clues. As for us humans - check this …' He pulls a lighter from his pocket, and motions us to hush. He clicks the lighter once, softly, then cranes an ear toward the toilet cubicles, where the other con still sits out of sight. After a moment, you hear rustling in the cubicle. Then a lighter clicks inside. We watch a puff of smoke rise up, as the con drags on a cigarette he didn't even know he wanted. The power of suggestion. Lasalle turns to me with a smile, and clicks his lighter in the air. 'Learn their needs, and they'll dance to any fuckin tune you play.'</p> 
<p>Jonesy grabs my arm as the group turns to the corridor. I wrassle free, and pounce a couple of steps after Lasalle, but Jonesy threads his arms through mine, Deadlocking me from behind. It's what he needs. I don't struggle.</p> 
<p>'Thanks, Lasalle,' I holler.</p> 
<p>'No sweat, Vernon God,' comes the voice.</p> 
<p>'Boy,' says Jonesy, when he gets me to the stairs, 'you really bought his bullshit.'</p> 
<p>'Somebody told me he was a preacher.'</p> 
<p>'Yeah, right. Clarence Lasalle, the fuckin axe-murderer.'</p> 
<p>I lie awake on my bunk tonight as Lasalle's execution buzzes from the TVs along the row. I expect to hear Taylor's voice, but one of my fellow inmates says she left the show to try and be a roving reporter. She has all the contacts now, I guess. Just needs that one big story. Anyway, we only catch the last hour of the show. Lasalle doesn't make any final statement, which seems kind of cool. He chooses 'I Got You under my Skin' for his final tune. What a guy.</p> 
<p>This view of my ceiling grows familiar over the rest of the week, I even work on my art project, underneath a towel, lying here on my back. The entertainment appliances disappear again, right after Lasalle's event, and I get to thinking about his last talkings. It all sounded too simple, like a TV-movie or something, like just any ole thing they'd run violin music to. It gets me thinking though, about my wasted ole damn life. They don't even have job descriptions for the kind of talents I have. I guess the tragedy is that I should've been up there as the prosecutor, or even Brian Dennehy - I'm the one that can sense stuff about people, and situations and all. Sure, I'm not a great student or anything, or athlete or anything, but I have these talents, I'm sure I have. I guess the way their powerdimes mount up against mine, the final tally of dimes in the power system means they go through, and I don't. One learning, though: my big flaw is fear. In a world where you're supposed to be a psycho, I just didn't yell loud enough to get ahead. I was too darn embarrassed to play God.</p> 
<p>Watch any animal, said Lasalle. Give them what they want, and watch any animal. I can understand the giving thing, but I spend nights all the way to the Ides of March, I survive two, then three more execution votes, trying to place the animal clues. I end up watching these useless brown moths that thwack around the light in my cell, felty splinters torn from nighttime, lost and confused. I guess they're animals. I hear moths are actually programmed to fly a straight line, steered by the moon. But these supermarket kind of lights mess up their navigation. Now look at them. I watch one snag behind the light cage, spanking dust off its wings in puffs. Then, 'Thp,' it spins to the floor, broken. The light just buzzes on. So much for the moon. I can relate to moths, boy.</p> 
<p>Fantasy animals start to infect my dreams, linen spaniels that romp with Jesus, but in daylight I struggle to make sense of Lasalle's concept. I guess the only permanent animal I know is Kurt the dog, and I ain't sure he counts when it comes to the Secret of Everything. Ole Kurt, who drives himself crazy with the smell of next door's barbecue, who props up his self-esteem by being president of the barking circuit. You know he wouldn't be president of anything, if the circuit knew how damn measly he was. He would've been laughed out of town, if they knew. But they don't.</p> 
<p>I sit up on the bunk. Kurt gets by with the bark of a much bigger dog.</p>
