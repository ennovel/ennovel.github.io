<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>‘THE worst place we’ve struck yet,’ said the commanding officer; ‘no facilities, no amenities, and Brigade sitting right on top of us. There’s one pub in Flyte St Mary with capacity for about twenty - that, of course, will be out of bounds for officers; there’s a Naafi in the camp area. I hope to run transport once a week to Melstead Carbury.&nbsp; Marchmain is ten miles away and damn-all when you get there. It will therefore be the first concern of company officers to organize recreation for their men. M.O., I want you to take a look at the lakes to see if they’re fit for bathing.’ ‘Very good, sir.’</p> 
<p>‘Brigade expects us to clean up the house for them. I should have thought some of those half-shaven scrim-shankers I see lounging round Headquarters might have saved us the trouble; however...Ryder, you will find a party of fifty and report to the Quartering Comandant at the house at 1045 hours; he’ll show you what we’re taking over.’</p> 
<p>‘Very good, sir.’</p> 
<p>‘Our predecessors do not seem to have been very enterprising. The valley has great potentialities for an assault course and a mortar range. Weapon-training officer, make a recce this morning and get something laid on before Brigade arrives.’ ‘Very good, sir.’</p> 
<p>‘I’m going out myself with the adjutant to recce training areas. Anyone happen to know this district?’</p> 
<p>I said nothing.</p> 
<p>‘That’s all then, get cracking.’</p> 
<p>‘Wonderful old place in its way,’ said the Quartering Commandant; ‘pity to knock it about too much.’</p> 
<p>He was an old, retired, re-appointed lieutenant-colonel from some miles away. We met in the space before the main doors, where I had my half-company fallen-in, waiting for orders. ‘Come in. I’ll soon show you over. It’s a great warren of a place, but we’ve only requisitioned the ground floor and half a dozen bedrooms. Everything else upstairs is still private property, mostly cram-full of furniture; you never saw such stuff, priceless some of it.</p> 
<p>‘There’s a caretaker and a couple of old servants live at the top - they won’t be any trouble to you - and a blitzed R.C. padre whom Lady Julia gave a home to -jittery old bird, but no trouble. He’s opened the chapel; that’s in bounds for the troops; surprising lot use it, too.</p> 
<p>‘The place belongs to Lady Julia Flyte, as she calls herself now. She was married to Mottram, the Minister of-whatever-it-is. She’s abroad in some woman’s service, and I try to keep an eye on things for her. Queer thing the old marquis leaving everything to her - rough on the boys.</p> 
<p>‘Now this is where the last lot put the clerks; plenty of room, anyway. I’ve had the walls and fireplaces boarded up you see valuable old work underneath. Hullo, someone seems to have been making a beast of himself here; destructive beggars, soldiers are!&nbsp; Lucky we spotted it, or it would have been charged to you chaps.&nbsp; ‘This is another good-sized room, used to be full of tapestry. I’d advise you to use this for conferences.’</p> 
<p>‘I’m only here to clean up, sir. Someone from Brigade will allot the rooms.’ ‘Oh, well, you’ve got an easy job. Very decent fellows the last lot. They shouldn’t have done that to the fireplace though. How did they manage it? Looks solid enough. I wonder if it can be mended?</p> 
<p>‘I expect the brigadier will take this for his office; the last did. It’s got a lot of painting that can’t be moved, done on the walls. As you see, I’ve covered it up as best I can, but</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>soldiers get through anything - as the brigadier’s done in the corner. There was another painted room, outside under pillars - modern work but, if you ask me, the prettiest in the place; it was the signal office and they made absolute hay of it; rather a shame.&nbsp; ‘This eyesore is what they used as the mess; that’s why I didn’t cover it up; not that it would matter much if it did get damaged; always reminds me of one of the costlier knocking-shops, you know - “ Maison Japonaise”...and this was the ante-room...’</p> 
<p>It did not take us long to make our tour of the echoing rooms. Then we went outside on the terrace.</p> 
<p>‘Those are the other ranks’ latrines and wash-house; can’t think why they built them just there; it was done before I took the job over. All this used to be cut off from the front. We laid the road through the trees joining it up with the main drive; unsightly but very practical; awful lot of transport comes in and out; cuts the place up, too. Look where one careless devil went smack through the box-hedge and carried away all that balustrade; did it with a three-ton lorry, too; you’d think he had a Churchill tank at least.&nbsp; ‘That fountain is rather a tender spot with our landlady; the young officers used to lark about in it on guest nights and it was looking a bit the worse for wear, so I wired it in and turned the water off. Looks a bit untidy now; all the drivers throw their cigarette-ends and the remains of the sandwiches there, and you can’t get to it to clean it up, since I put the wire round it. Florid great thing, isn’t it?...</p> 
<p>‘Well, if you’ve seen everything I’ll push off. Good day to you.’ His driver threw a cigarette into the dry basin of the fountain; saluted and opened the door of the car. I saluted and the Quartering Commandant drove away through the new, metalled gap in the lime trees.</p> 
<p>‘Hooper,’ I said, when I had seen my men started, ‘do you think I can safely leave you in charge of the work-party for half an hour?’</p> 
<p>‘I was just wondering where we could scrounge some tea.’</p> 
<p>‘For Christ’s sake,’ I said, ‘they’ve only just begun work.’</p> 
<p>‘They’re awfully browned off.’</p> 
<p>‘Keep them at it.’</p> 
<p>‘Rightyoh.’</p> 
<p>I did not spend long in the desolate ground-floor rooms, but went upstairs and wandered down the familiar corridors, trying doors that were locked, opening doors into rooms piled to the ceiling with furniture. At length I met an old housemaid carrying a cup of tea. ‘Why,’ she said, ‘isn’t it Mr Ryder?’</p> 
<p>‘It is. I was wondering when I should meet someone I know.’</p> 
<p>‘Mrs Hawkins is up in her old room. I was just taking her some tea.’ ‘I’ll take it for you, I said, and passed through the baize doors, up the uncarpeted stairs, to the nursery.</p> 
<p>Nanny Hawkins did not recognize me until I spoke, and my arrival threw her into some confusion; it was not until I had been sitting some time by her fireside that she recovered her old calm. She, who had changed so little in all the years I knew her, had lately become greatly aged. The changes of the last years had come too late in her life to be accepted and understood; her sight was failing, she told me, and she could see only the coarsest needlework. Her speech, sharpened by years of gentle conversation, had reverted now to the soft, peasant tones of its origin.</p> 
<p>‘...only myself here and the two girls and poor Father Membling who was blown up, not a roof to his head nor a stick of furniture till Julia took him in with the kind heart she’s got, and his nerves something shocking...Lady Brideshead, too, Marchmain it is now, who I ought by rights to call her Ladyship now, but it doesn’t come natural, it was the same with her. First, when Julia and Cordelia left to the war, she came here with the two boys and then the military turned them out, so they went to London, nor they hadn’t been in their house not a month, and Bridey away with the yeomanry the same as his poor Lordship, when they were blown up too, everything gone, all the furniture she brought here and kept in the coach-house. Then she had another house outside London, and the military took that, too, and there she is now, when I last heard, in a hotel at the seaside, which isn’t the same as your own home, is it? It doesn’t seem right.&nbsp; ‘...Did you listen to Mr Mottram last night? Very nasty he was about Hitler. I said to the girl Effie who does for me: “If Hitler was listening, and if he understands English, which I doubt, he must feel very small.” Who would have thought of Mr Mottram doing so well? And so many of his friends, too, that used to stay here? I said to Mr Wilcox, who comes to see me regular on the bus from Melstead twice a month, which is very good of him and I appreciate it, I said: “We were entertaining angels unawares,” because Mr Wilcox never liked Mr Mottram’s friends, which I never saw, but used to hear about from all of you, nor Julia didn’t like them, but they’ve done very well, haven’t they?’</p> 
<p>At last I asked her: ‘Have you heard from Julia?’</p> 
<p>‘From Cordelia, only last week, and they’re together still as they have been all the time, and Julia sent me love at the bottom of the page. They’re both very well, though they couldn’t say where, but Father Membling said, reading between the lines, it was Palestine, which is where Bridey’s yeomanry is, so that’s very nice for them all. Cordelia said they were looking forward to coming home after the war, which I am sure we all are, though whether I live to see it, is another story.’</p> 
<p>I stayed with her for half an hour, and left promising to return often. When I reached the hall I found no sign of work and Hooper looking guilty.&nbsp; ‘They had to go off to draw the bed-straw. I didn’t know till Sergeant Block told me. I don’t know whether they’re coming back.’</p> 
<p>‘Don’t know? What orders did you give?’</p> 
<p>‘Well, I told Sergeant Block to bring them back if he thought it was worthwhile; I mean if there was time before dinner.’</p> 
<p>It was nearly twelve. ‘You’ve been hotted again, Hooper. That straw was to be drawn any time before six tonight.’</p> 
<p>‘Oh Lor; sorry, Ryder. Sergeant Block - ‘</p> 
<p>‘It’s my own fault for going away...Fall in the same party immediately after dinner, bring them back here and keep them here till the job’s done.’ ‘Rightyoh. I say, did you say you knew this place before?’ ‘Yes, very well. It belongs to friends of mine,’ and as I said the words they sounded as odd in my I ears as Sebastian’s had done, when, instead of saying, ‘It is my home,’ he said, ‘It is where my family live.’</p> 
<p>‘It doesn’t seem to make any sense - one family in a place this size. What’s the use of it?’</p> 
<p>‘Well, I suppose Brigade are finding it useful.’</p> 
<p>‘But that’s not what it was built for, is it?’</p> 
<p>‘No,’ I said, ‘not what it was built for. Perhaps that’s one of the pleasures of building, like having a son, wondering how he’ll grow up. I don’t know; I never built anything, and I forfeited the right to watch my son grow up. I’m homeless, childless, middle-aged, loveless, Hooper.’ He looked to see if I was being funny, decided that I was, and laughed. ‘Now go back to camp, keep out of the C.O.’s way, if he’s back from his recce, and don’t let on to anyone that we’ve made a nonsense of the morning.’ ‘Okey, Ryder.’</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There was one part of the house I had not yet visited, and I went there now. The chapel showed no ill-effects of its long neglect; the art-nouveau paint was as fresh and bright as ever; the art-nouveau lamp burned once more before the altar. I said a prayer, an ancient, newly-learned form of words, and left, turning towards the camp; and as I walked back, and the cook-house bugle sounded ahead of me, I thought:</p> 
<p>‘The builders did not know the uses to which their work would descend; they made a new house with the stones of the old castle; year by year, generation after generation, they enriched and extended it; year by year the great harvest of timber in the park grew to ripeness; until, in sudden frost, came the age of Hooper; the place was desolate and the work all brought to nothing; Quomodo sedet sola civitas. Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.</p> 
<p>‘And yet,’ I thought, stepping out more briskly towards the camp, where the bugles after a pause had taken up the second call and were sounding ‘Pick-em-up, pick-em-up, hot potatoes’, ‘and yet that is not the last word; it is not even an apt word; it is a dead word from ten years back.</p> 
<p>‘Something quite remote from anything the builders intended, has come out of their work, and out of the fierce little human tragedy in which I played; something none of us thought about at the time; a small red flame - a beaten-copper lamp of deplorable design relit before the beaten-copper doors of a tabernacle; the flame which the old knights saw from their tombs, which they saw put out; that flame burns again for other soldiers, far from home, farther, in heart, than Acre or Jerusalem. It could not have been lit but for the builders and the tragedians, and there I found it this morning, burning anew among the old stones.’</p> 
<p>I quickened my pace and reached the hut which served us for our ante-room.</p> 
<p>‘You’re looking unusually cheerful today,’ said the second-in-command.</p> 
<p>“到现在为止，这是我们到过的最糟糕的地方了。”那个指挥官说道，“没有便利设备，又没有什么可玩儿的，旅部就驻在我们的上头。弗莱特圣玛丽地方有个小酒店，大概能坐二十来人——当然啦，这地方是不准许军官进去的；在营地还有一个三军小卖部。我希望一个星期去梅尔斯蒂德—卡伯里跑一趟运输。马奇梅因家的宅邸离这儿有十英里路，等你到了那儿一切也都完蛋啦。所有军官们首先关心的事情就是给他们连队的士兵们组织娱乐活动。军医官，我希望你去看看那些水池，看看那儿适不适合洗澡。”</p> 
<p>“是，长官。”</p> 
<p>“旅部指望我们把这所房子给他们打扫干净。我本来认为我看见的一些胡子拉碴的、在司令部附近游逛、什么事儿也不干的那些军官们会免了咱们这件麻烦事。但是……赖德，你去找五十人一组的杂役，然后在十点四十五分的时候去那所房子向营指挥官报到；他会向你们交代任务的。”</p> 
<p>“是，长官。”</p> 
<p>“看来我们前任的气魄并不是很大。这个山谷有很大潜力来进行突击训练和迫击炮射击的。武器训练官，今天上午去侦察，在旅部到达前把东西布置好。”</p> 
<p>“是，长官。”</p> 
<p>“我要亲自和副官出去侦察一下训练地区。有谁熟悉这个地方？”</p> 
<p>我没说话。</p> 
<p>“那么就完了，开始干吧。”</p> 
<p>“就它本身说，这个旧宅可真了不起，”营指挥官说，“可惜毁得太厉害了。”</p> 
<p>他是一位上了年纪的、退了伍又重新任命的陆军中校，从几英里路外来的。我们在大门前一块空地上见面，我率领着我的集合起来的半连兵士在这儿待命。“请进。我带去到处看看。这地方的房子很多，不过我们只征用了一楼，还有五六间卧室。楼上其余的一切还是私人财产，大部分都塞满了家具。你决没有见过那样的东西，有些可是无价之宝哩。</p> 
<p>“楼的顶层还住着一个看房人和两个老仆人——他们决不会麻烦你的——还有一个受了闪电战袭击影响的红十字会随军牧师，朱莉娅小姐给了他一间屋子——一个惶惶不可终日的老家伙，不过也不碍事。他已经开放了那个小教堂；那地方准许部队进去；利用这个小教堂的人可多极啦。</p> 
<p>“这个地方是属于朱莉娅·弗莱特小姐的，现在她这样称呼自己。她原来嫁给了莫特拉姆，不知道是个什么部的部长。她现在在国外的某个妇女服务部门工作，我尽力给她照管这些东西。说来也怪，那个老侯爵把所有的东西都留给她了——对儿子们可狠啦。</p> 
<p>“现在这是最后一处安顿办事员的地方了；不管怎样，还有很多房间。你看，我已经叫人把墙壁和壁炉都用木板盖住了——那下面是很有价值的古老的作品。喂，好像有人在这儿捣蛋呢，一批搞破坏的穷要饭的，这些士兵们！幸亏我们发现了这个地方，否则就会让你们把这地方糟蹋了。</p> 
<p>“这是另一间大房子，过去里面都是挂毯和绒绣。我建议你把这间屋子做会议室。”</p> 
<p>“我只是来这儿打扫的，长官。以后旅部的人会来分配房间。”</p> 
<p>“哦，嗯，你可捞了一件轻松的活儿；最后来到的这批人可真是很不错。可是他们不该把壁炉弄成这个样子。他们怎么弄的？壁炉看来是很结实的。不知道这壁炉能不能修好？</p> 
<p>“我估计旅长会把这间屋子当他们办公室的；上一个长官就是这样做的。这间屋子里有许多画没法移走，那是画在墙上的。像你看到的，我已经尽可能把墙都覆盖起来了，可是当兵的什么事都干得出来——就像旅长在那个角落里干的那样。另外还有一间画了画的屋子，在外面廊柱下——都是现代画，你要问我的话，我得说那是这所宅院最最出色的东西了；原来这儿当了通讯部，他们把这里弄得乱七八糟，真太不像话了。</p> 
<p>“这个难看的房间是他们原来当饭厅用的，所以我没有把这间屋子的墙盖住；即使遭到毁害，倒也不会有太大的关系。这地方总使我想起一家颇豪华的拍卖商店，你知道——叫‘日本式房间’……这是接待室……”</p> 
<p>没费多长时间我们就浏览了这些发出回声的空房间。随后，我们出来走到平台上。</p> 
<p>“这间房子是其他军阶的军官的厕所和盥洗室，真猜不透他们为什么偏偏要把厕所建在这个地方。我接管这项工作以前这地方就搞成这样了。这里和前边原来是隔断的。我们铺设了穿过树林那条小路，使它与大路连接起来，虽然不很雅观，却很实用。进进出出的运输车辆多极了，也把这地方弄得乱七八糟的。看看，不知哪个冒失鬼不偏不倚正从黄杨树篱中间穿过去，把所有的栏杆都撞倒了；还是一辆三吨卡车干的。你还会以为至少是一辆丘吉尔型坦克干的。</p> 
<p>“那个喷泉是我们女主人最心爱的一处地方。每逢招待宾客的夜晚，青年军官们经常在里面嬉闹，这个喷泉装置有点破烂不堪了，所以我就用铁丝网把它围起来，并且把水源关掉。看起来现在还是有些不整洁。司机们都把烟蒂和吃剩的三明治扔到里面，你们无法进里面去打扫，因为我在四周拉了铁丝网。真是个漂亮的、了不起的地方，是不是……”</p> 
<p>“喂，如果你所有的地方都看过了，那我可就走了。祝你今天顺利。”</p> 
<p>他的司机把一支烟卷扔进了喷泉干涸了的池里，行了一个礼，然后打开了小汽车的车门。我行了礼，这位营指挥官的车就开走了，穿过了橙树林中那条新开的碎石铺路的豁口。</p> 
<p>“胡珀，”我叫道，这时我已经看到我的人开始干起来了，“你看我把这伙人让你管半小时行不行？”</p> 
<p>“刚才我一直在琢磨，不知道我们能在什么地方搞到一些茶叶。”</p> 
<p>“看在基督的面上，”我说道，“他们才刚刚开始干活哩。”</p> 
<p>“大家都厌倦透了。”</p> 
<p>“叫他们别松劲儿。”</p> 
<p>“好嘞。”</p> 
<p>我在凄凉萧索的一楼逗留的时间不长，我上了楼，徘徊在那熟悉的走廊里，我试着推开锁着的门，打开没锁的门进去看看，里面的家具一直堆到天花板。最后我终于碰见了一位老女仆，她手里端着一杯茶。“哎呀，”她说道，“这不是赖德先生吗？”</p> 
<p>“是我。我正在想什么时候能碰到一个熟人呢。”</p> 
<p>“霍金斯太太正在上面她原来的屋子里呢。我这是给她端茶去。”</p> 
<p>“我替你拿吧。”我说，穿过一扇扇挂着粗呢布的门，走上没有铺地毯的楼梯，就到了育婴室。</p> 
<p>保姆霍金斯直到我说话才认出我来，我的到来一时使她有点慌乱。直到我在炉边挨着她坐了一会儿，她才恢复了原来的那种平静。她在我认识她的这些年中变化不大，但近来也显得老态龙钟了。最近几年的种种变故在她的晚年发生，所以很难让她接受和理解。她告诉我说，她的眼力已经不行了，只能做一些粗针线活计。她的声音由于多年温柔的谈话边的尖锐了，现在却又恢复了原来那种柔和而悦耳的声调了。</p> 
<p>“……只有我自己还在这儿，还有两个年轻的女仆，和那个可怜的蒙布灵神父，他的家遭了轰炸，炸得简直上无片瓦，一点家具也没有，后来朱莉娅菩萨心肠把他带到这儿来住，他的神经受到些刺激……还有布赖兹赫德夫人，现在是马奇梅因夫人了，照理说，我该尊称她‘夫人’的，可是这么叫她，我感到很别扭，她也很别扭。起先，朱莉娅和科迪莉娅打仗去了，她就带着两个男孩到这儿来了，后来军队把他们赶出去了，他们就去了伦敦。他们在家里连一个月都没有住到，布赖德就像可怜的爵爷一样，跟义勇骑兵队走了，他们的家也遭了轰炸，所有的东西都没了，她过去搬到这儿的、存放在马车房里的家具也统统没有了。她在伦敦郊区又弄到一所房子，后来也被军队占用了。我最后听说，她现在住在海边一家旅馆里，那种地方总归和自己家一不一样吧？这也似乎不怎么合适啦。</p> 
<p>“……你昨天晚上没有听莫特拉姆先生的讲话吧？他把希特勒骂得狗血喷头。我对服侍我的女仆艾菲说：‘如果希特勒在听他的讲话，如果他听得懂英语的话，虽然我不太相信，那他一定也会觉得没脸见人啦。’谁想得到莫特拉姆会干得这么漂亮呢？还有他的那么多在这儿住过的朋友也干得不错。威尔科克斯先生经常按时搭公共汽车从梅尔斯蒂德来看我，每个月两次，他人可真好，我很感激。我对他说：‘真没想到，我们招待的还是一帮子天使呢。’因为威尔科克斯先生从来也不喜欢莫特拉姆先生那帮子朋友，我没有看见过那些人，还都是听你们说的，朱莉娅也不喜欢他们，不过他们干得很漂亮，不是吗？”</p> 
<p>最后我问她：“你接到过朱莉娅的信吗？”</p> 
<p>“科迪莉娅来过信，是在上星期，她们一直在一起。朱莉娅在信纸下边附了一句问候我的话。她们两个都很好，尽管她们不能说在什么地方，可是蒙布灵神父说，从字里行间体会到那地方是巴勒斯坦，布赖德的义勇骑兵队也在那个地方，这样对他们来说可就好了。科迪莉娅说，她们盼望打完仗回家来，我相信我们大家都盼着这一天呢，不过我活不活得到那一天，就是另一回事了。”</p> 
<p>我在她那儿待了半个小时，离开时答应常来看她。我走到走廊时，发现人们没有干活的迹象，胡珀一脸内疚的神色。</p> 
<p>“他们都得去拉垫床的草去了。布洛克中士告诉我时，我才知道。我不知道他们是不是快回来了。”</p> 
<p>“不知道？你怎么下达的命令的？”</p> 
<p>“噢，我告诉布洛克中士说，如果他认为还值得拉的话，那就把士兵的垫草拉回来，我的意思是说如果晚饭前还有时间的话。”</p> 
<p>这时已经将近十二点了。“胡珀，你们又心血来潮了。下午六点以前，有的是时间去拉草呀。”</p> 
<p>“唉，上帝，对不起，赖德，布洛克中士——”</p> 
<p>“都怪我自己走开了……一吃完中饭把那批人集合起来带到这儿来，把活干完了才能放他们走。”</p> 
<p>“好咧——啊，喂，你不是说你以前认识这个地方吗？”</p> 
<p>“认识，很熟悉这儿。它是我的一位朋友的。”当我说出这几个字的时候，这几个字在我听起来就像塞巴斯蒂安说这话时一样的古怪，那时他没有说“这是我的家”，而是说“这是我的家住的地方”。</p> 
<p>“这似乎没有什么意思吧——一个家住在这么大的地方。有什么用呢？”</p> 
<p>“嗯，我想旅长觉得它很有用处的。”</p> 
<p>“可是当初这所房子可不是为了这个用途造的吧？”</p> 
<p>“不是，”我说，“当然不是为这个用途造的。也许只是出于一种建筑方面的乐趣而已，就像生一个儿子，却不知道他会怎么长大成人。我也不知道；我什么也没有建筑过，而且我也失去了把我的儿子抚养成人的权利。我没有家，没有儿女，到了中年，没有爱情，胡珀。”他望了望我，看看我是不是在说笑话，后来断定我真是如此，就笑了起来。“现在回营房去吧，避开指挥官，如果他搜索完了回来，别向任何人透露出我们一上午干的蠢事。”</p> 
<p>“好咧——啊，赖德。”</p> 
<p>这所住宅有一处我还没有去过，现在我去了那里。小教堂并没有露出年久失修的凋敝景象；那幅“新艺术”绘画还像以前那样新鲜和光泽照眼；那“新艺术”的灯又在祭坛前点燃起来。我念了一句祈祷文，那是一句古老的、新学来的祈祷词，念完了就离开了那儿，转身朝营房走去。在我往回走的路上，我听见前方炊事班号声响起来了，这时我想：</p> 
<p>“建筑者们不知道他们的建筑将会落得什么样的用场。他们用那个旧城堡的石块建造了一所新房子；年复一年，一代一代，他们装饰，扩建这所房子；一年年过去，园林里郁郁葱葱的树长大成材；直到后来严霜骤降，出现了胡珀的时代；于是这片地方萧条荒废，整个工程荡然无存；寂无人烟的城就像这样屹立在那里。空虚的空虚，一切都是空虚。</p> 
<p>“但是，”我一边思索着，一边步履轻捷地走向营房，原来的号声停顿了一下，接着又开始响起来，发出“快来——吃哟，快来——吃哟，热乎乎的土豆哟”的号声，“但是这还不是最后的话；甚至也还不是恰当的话；而是十年前一个死去了的字眼。</p> 
<p>“建造者们最初未料到的东西已经从他们的建筑中产生，从我在其中扮演了个角色的剧烈的小小人间悲剧中产生；某种我们当时谁也没有想到的东西已经产生。一个小小的红色火光——一盏有着凄凉图案的铜箔灯盏在礼拜堂的铜箔大门前重新点燃，这是古老的骑士从他们坟墓里看到点燃上、又看见熄灭掉的火光；这火光又为另外的士兵们点燃上，他们的心远离家庭，比亚克港、比耶路撒冷还要遥远。要不是为了建筑师们和悲剧演员们，这灯光不会重新点燃的，而今天早晨我找到了它，在古老的石块中间重新点燃起来。”</p> 
<p>我加快了步子，到了那间供我们做会客室的小屋。</p> 
<p>“今天你看起来非常愉快。”那位副指挥官说。</p>
