He was holding out his hand to me.
<br> 
<br> “Your face is stern, monsieur,” he said. “Were you fighting your old battles o’er again?”
<br> 
<br> “No—new ones!” I laughed, springing up and seizing his hand.
<br> 
<br> “May you win them, as of old!” he exclaimed, with great heartiness.
<br> 
<br> “You are generous, monsieur,” I said gently, looking him in the eyes.
<br> 
<br> But this remark he took as quite the ordinary reply, and with a bright glance for us all he moved toward the door. Yvonne followed him, as it seemed was expected of her.
<br> 
<br> “Must you go so early?” she asked, with a kindness in her voice which pierced me.
<br> 
<br> “Yes,” he said, looking down at her upturned face. “The tide is just right now, and this fair 44wind must not be lost. It will be a fine run under this moon; and Pierre has the new boat over to-night.”
<br> 
<br> “It is a good night,” she assented, peering through the open door with a gesture of gay inquiry; “and how sweet the apple-blossoms smell! Have you as good air as this, Monsieur Grande, on those western rivers of yours, or at Trois Pistoles?”
<br> 
<br> As she did not turn her head or seem to require an answer, I made none. And, indeed, I was spared the necessity, for Anderson intervened with matter of his own.
<br> 
<br> “Come down to the gate with me, won’t you?” I heard him beg in a low voice.
<br> 
<br> But for some reason Mademoiselle was not disposed to be kind that night. She drew back, and looked down pointedly at her dainty embroidered moccasins.
<br> 
<br> “Oh,” she cried lightly and aloud, with a tantalizing ring in her voice, “just think how wet the path is!”
<br> 
<br> Anderson turned away with a disappointed air, whereupon she reached out her hand imperiously for him to kiss. Then she waved him a gay bon voyage, and came back into the room with a quick lightness of step which seemed like laughter in itself. Her eyes were a dancing marvel, with some strange excitement.
<br> 
<br> 45“Monsieur,” she began, coming straight toward me. But I just then awoke to my purpose.
<br> 
<br> “A thousand pardons, mademoiselle and madame!” I cried, springing to my feet and hastening to the door. “I will be back in two moments; but I have a word for Monsieur Anderson before he goes.”
<br> 
<br> That I should interrupt her in this way, and rush off when she was about to speak to me, fetched a sudden little cloud of astonishment over Yvonne’s face. But I would not be delayed. I made haste down the path and caught Anderson before he reached the gate. He paused with an air of genial surprise.
<br> 
<br> “Your pardon, monsieur,” said I; “but with your permission I will accompany you a few steps, as I have something to say to you.”
<br> 
<br> “I am glad to have your company, monsieur,” said he, with a manner that spoke sincerity.
<br> 
<br> “Are you?” said I abruptly. “Well, somehow I take your words as something more than the thin clink of compliment. I like you—I liked you the moment my eyes fell upon you.”
<br> 
<br> His face flashed into a rare illumination, and without a word he held out his hand.
<br> 
<br> I could not but smile responsively, though I thrust my hand behind my back and shook my head.
<br> 
<br> “Wait!” said I. “I want to say to you that—I love—I love Mademoiselle de Lamourie!”
<br> 
<br> 46His face clouded a little, and he withdrew his hand, but not angrily.
<br> 
<br> “We are very much of one mind in that, I assure you,” he said.
<br> 
<br> “The very ground she walks upon is sacred to me,” I continued.
<br> 
<br> He smiled ever so little at the passion of my speech, but answered thoughtfully:
<br> 
<br> “It is but natural, I suppose. I do not think we will quarrel upon that score, monsieur.”
<br> 
<br> “For two years,” said I, in a low voice, speaking coldly and evenly, “I have been moved night and day by this love only. It has supported me in hunger and in weariness; it has led me in the wilderness; it has strengthened me in the fight; it has been more to me than all ambition. Even my love of my country has been second to it. I came here to-day for one reason only. And I find—you!”
<br> 
<br> “None can know so well as I what you have lost, monsieur,” said he very gravely, “as none can know so well as I what I have gained.”
<br> 
<br> His kindness, no less than his confidence, hurt me.
<br> 
<br> “Are you so sure?” I asked.
<br> 
<br> “The discussion is unusual, monsieur,” said he, with a sudden resentment. “I will only remind you that Mademoiselle de Lamourie has accepted my suit.”
<br> 
<br> 47No man’s sternness has ever troubled me, and I smiled slightly in acknowledgment of his very reasonable remark.
<br> 
<br> “The situation is unusual, so you must pardon me,” said I, “if I arrogate to myself a somewhat unusual freedom. I tell you now frankly that by all open and honorable means I will strive to win the love of Mademoiselle de Lamourie. I have hope that she has not yet clearly found the wisdom of her heart. I believe that I, not you, am the man whom she will love. Laugh at my vanity as much as you will. I am not yet ready to say my hope is dead, my life turned to nothingness.”
<br> 
<br> “You are weak,” said he, with some severity, “to hold your life thus, as it were, in jeopardy of a woman’s whim.”
<br> 
<br> I could hardly restrain my voice from betraying a certain triumph which I felt at this sign of imperfection in his love.
<br> 
<br> “If you hold it a weakness,” said I, “there is a point at last in which we differ. If it be a weakness, then it is one which, up to two years ago, I had scarce dared hope to attain. Few, indeed, are the women, and as few men, strong enough for the full knowledge of love.”
<br> 
<br> “Yet the greatest love is not the whole of life,” he averred disputatiously.
<br> 
<br> “You speak but coldly,” said I, “for the lover of Mademoiselle de Lamourie.”
<br> 
<br> 48He started. I had stung him. “I am of the Society of Friends—a Quaker!” said he harshly. “I do not fight. I lift not my hand against my fellow-man. Yet did I believe that you would succeed in winning her love, I think I would kill you where you stand!”
<br> 
<br> I liked the sharp lines of his face as he said it, fronting me with eyes grown suddenly cruel. I felt that he meant it, for the moment at least.
<br> 
<br> “Say, rather,” said I, smiling, “that you would honestly try your best to kill me. It would be an interesting experiment. Well, now we understand each other. I will honestly try my best to do you what will be, in my eyes, the sorest injury in the world. But I will try by fair means only, and if I fail I will bear you no grudge. In all else, however, believe that I do greatly desire your welfare, and will seize with eagerness any occasion of doing you a service. You are perhaps less unworthy of Mademoiselle de Lamourie than I am, save that you cannot love her so well. And now,” I added with a smile, “will you take my hand?”
<br> 
<br> As I held it out to him he at first drew back and seemed disposed to repulse me. Then his face cleared.
<br> 
<br> “You are honest!” he exclaimed, and wrung my hand with great cordiality. “I rather like you—and I am very sorry for you. I have her promise.”
<br> 
<br> 49“Well,” said I, “if also you have her love you are the most fortunate man on God’s earth!”
<br> 
<br> “I have it!” said he blithely, and strode off down the path between the apple-trees, his fine shoulders held squarely, and a confidence in all his bearing. But a wave of pity for him, and strange tenderness, went over me in that moment, for in that moment I felt an assurance that I should win.
<br> 
<br> It was an assurance doomed to swift ruin. It was an assurance destined soon to be hidden under such a vast wreckage of my hopes that even memory marvelled when she dragged it forth to light.
