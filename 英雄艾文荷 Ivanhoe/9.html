<p>The condition of the English nation was at this time sufficiently miserable. King Richard was absent a prisoner, and in the power of the perfidious and cruel Duke of Austria. Even the very place of his captivity was uncertain, and his fate but very imperfectly known to the generality of his subjects, who were, in the meantime, a prey to every species of subaltern oppression.</p> 
<p>Prince John, in league with Philip of France, Coeur-de-Lion's mortal enemy, was using every species of influence with the Duke of Austria, to prolong the captivity of his brother Richard, to whom he stood indebted for so many favours. In the meantime, he was strengthening his own faction in the kingdom, of which he proposed to dispute the succession, in case of the King's death, with the legitimate heir, Arthur Duke of Brittany, son of Geoffrey Plantagenet, the elder brother of John. This usurpation, it is well known, he afterwards effected. His own character being light, profligate, and perfidious, John easily attached to his person and faction, not only all who had reason to dread the resentment of Richard for criminal proceedings during his absence, but also the numerous class of "lawless resolutes," whom the crusades had turned back on their country, accomplished in the vices of the East, impoverished in substance, and hardened in character, and who placed their hopes of harvest in civil commotion. To these causes of public distress and apprehension, must be added, the multitude of outlaws, who, driven to despair by the oppression of the feudal nobility, and the severe exercise of the forest laws, banded together in large gangs, and, keeping possession of the forests and the wastes, set at defiance the justice and magistracy of the country. The nobles themselves, each fortified within his own castle, and playing the petty sovereign over his own dominions, were the leaders of bands scarce less lawless and oppressive than those of the avowed depredators. To maintain these retainers, and to support the extravagance and magnificence which their pride induced them to affect, the nobility borrowed sums of money from the Jews at the most usurious interest, which gnawed into their estates like consuming cankers, scarce to be cured unless when circumstances gave them an opportunity of getting free, by exercising upon their creditors some act of unprincipled violence.</p> 
<p>Under the various burdens imposed by this unhappy state of affairs, the people of England suffered deeply for the present, and had yet more dreadful cause to fear for the future. To augment their misery, a contagious disorder of a dangerous nature spread through the land; and, rendered more virulent by the uncleanness, the indifferent food, and the wretched lodging of the lower classes, swept off many whose fate the survivors were tempted to envy, as exempting them from the evils which were to come.</p> 
<p>Yet amid these accumulated distresses, the poor as well as the rich, the vulgar as well as the noble, in the event of a tournament, which was the grand spectacle of that age, felt as much interested as the half-starved citizen of Madrid, who has not a real left to buy provisions for his family, feels in the issue of a bull-feast. Neither duty nor infirmity could keep youth or age from such exhibitions. The Passage of Arms, as it was called, which was to take place at Ashby, in the county of Leicester, as champions of the first renown were to take the field in the presence of Prince John himself, who was expected to grace the lists, had attracted universal attention, and an immense confluence of persons of all ranks hastened upon the appointed morning to the place of combat.</p> 
<p>The scene was singularly romantic. On the verge of a wood, which approached to within a mile of the town of Ashby, was an extensive meadow, of the finest and most beautiful green turf, surrounded on one side by the forest, and fringed on the other by straggling oak-trees, some of which had grown to an immense size. The ground, as if fashioned on purpose for the martial display which was intended, sloped gradually down on all sides to a level bottom, which was enclosed for the lists with strong palisades, forming a space of a quarter of a mile in length, and about half as broad. The form of the enclosure was an oblong square, save that the corners were considerably rounded off, in order to afford more convenience for the spectators. The openings for the entry of the combatants were at the northern and southern extremities of the lists, accessible by strong wooden gates, each wide enough to admit two horsemen riding abreast. At each of these portals were stationed two heralds, attended by six trumpets, as many pursuivants, and a strong body of men-at-arms for maintaining order, and ascertaining the quality of the knights who proposed to engage in this martial game.</p> 
<p>On a platform beyond the southern entrance, formed by a natural elevation of the ground, were pitched five magnificent pavilions, adorned with pennons of russet and black, the chosen colours of the five knights challengers. The cords of the tents were of the same colour. Before each pavilion was suspended the shield of the knight by whom it was occupied, and beside it stood his squire, quaintly disguised as a salvage or silvan man, or in some other fantastic dress, according to the taste of his master, and the character he was pleased to assume during the game.*</p> 
<p>* This sort of masquerade is supposed to have occasioned the * introduction of supporters into the science of heraldry.</p> 
<p>The central pavilion, as the place of honour, had been assigned to Brian be Bois-Guilbert, whose renown in all games of chivalry, no less than his connexions with the knights who had undertaken this Passage of Arms, had occasioned him to be eagerly received into the company of the challengers, and even adopted as their chief and leader, though he had so recently joined them. On one side of his tent were pitched those of Reginald Front-de-Boeuf and Richard de Malvoisin, and on the other was the pavilion of Hugh de Grantmesnil, a noble baron in the vicinity, whose ancestor had been Lord High Steward of England in the time of the Conqueror, and his son William Rufus. Ralph de Vipont, a knight of St John of Jerusalem, who had some ancient possessions at a place called Heather, near Ashby-de-la-Zouche, occupied the fifth pavilion. From the entrance into the lists, a gently sloping passage, ten yards in breadth, led up to the platform on which the tents were pitched. It was strongly secured by a palisade on each side, as was the esplanade in front of the pavilions, and the whole was guarded by men-at-arms.</p> 
<p>The northern access to the lists terminated in a similar entrance of thirty feet in breadth, at the extremity of which was a large enclosed space for such knights as might be disposed to enter the lists with the challengers, behind which were placed tents containing refreshments of every kind for their accommodation, with armourers, tarriers, and other attendants, in readiness to give their services wherever they might be necessary.</p> 
<p>The exterior of the lists was in part occupied by temporary galleries, spread with tapestry and carpets, and accommodated with cushions for the convenience of those ladies and nobles who were expected to attend the tournament. A narrow space, betwixt these galleries and the lists, gave accommodation for yeomanry and spectators of a better degree than the mere vulgar, and might be compared to the pit of a theatre. The promiscuous multitude arranged themselves upon large banks of turf prepared for the purpose, which, aided by the natural elevation of the ground, enabled them to overlook the galleries, and obtain a fair view into the lists. Besides the accommodation which these stations afforded, many hundreds had perched themselves on the branches of the trees which surrounded the meadow; and even the steeple of a country church, at some distance, was crowded with spectators.</p> 
<p>It only remains to notice respecting the general arrangement, that one gallery in the very centre of the eastern side of the lists, and consequently exactly opposite to the spot where the shock of the combat was to take place, was raised higher than the others, more richly decorated, and graced by a sort of throne and canopy, on which the royal arms were emblazoned. Squires, pages, and yeomen in rich liveries, waited around this place of honour, which was designed for Prince John and his attendants. Opposite to this royal gallery was another, elevated to the same height, on the western side of the lists; and more gaily, if less sumptuously decorated, than that destined for the Prince himself. A train of pages and of young maidens, the most beautiful who could be selected, gaily dressed in fancy habits of green and pink, surrounded a throne decorated in the same colours. Among pennons and flags bearing wounded hearts, burning hearts, bleeding hearts, bows and quivers, and all the commonplace emblems of the triumphs of Cupid, a blazoned inscription informed the spectators, that this seat of honour was designed for "La Royne de las Beaulte et des Amours". But who was to represent the Queen of Beauty and of Love on the present occasion no one was prepared to guess.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, spectators of every description thronged forward to occupy their respective stations, and not without many quarrels concerning those which they were entitled to hold. Some of these were settled by the men-at-arms with brief ceremony; the shafts of their battle-axes, and pummels of their swords, being readily employed as arguments to convince the more refractory. Others, which involved the rival claims of more elevated persons, were determined by the heralds, or by the two marshals of the field, William de Wyvil, and Stephen de Martival, who, armed at all points, rode up and down the lists to enforce and preserve good order among the spectators.</p> 
<p>Gradually the galleries became filled with knights and nobles, in their robes of peace, whose long and rich-tinted mantles were contrasted with the gayer and more splendid habits of the ladies, who, in a greater proportion than even the men themselves, thronged to witness a sport, which one would have thought too bloody and dangerous to afford their sex much pleasure. The lower and interior space was soon filled by substantial yeomen and burghers, and such of the lesser gentry, as, from modesty, poverty, or dubious title, durst not assume any higher place. It was of course amongst these that the most frequent disputes for precedence occurred.</p> 
<p>"Dog of an unbeliever," said an old man, whose threadbare tunic bore witness to his poverty, as his sword, and dagger, and golden chain intimated his pretensions to rank,---"whelp of a she-wolf! darest thou press upon a Christian, and a Norman gentleman of the blood of Montdidier?"</p> 
<p>This rough expostulation was addressed to no other than our acquaintance Isaac, who, richly and even magnificently dressed in a gaberdine ornamented with lace and lined with fur, was endeavouring to make place in the foremost row beneath the gallery for his daughter, the beautiful Rebecca, who had joined him at Ashby, and who was now hanging on her father's arm, not a little terrified by the popular displeasure which seemed generally excited by her parent's presumption. But Isaac, though we have seen him sufficiently timid on other occasions, knew well that at present he had nothing to fear. It was not in places of general resort, or where their equals were assembled, that any avaricious or malevolent noble durst offer him injury. At such meetings the Jews were under the protection of the general law; and if that proved a weak assurance, it usually happened that there were among the persons assembled some barons, who, for their own interested motives, were ready to act as their protectors. On the present occasion, Isaac felt more than usually confident, being aware that Prince John was even then in the very act of negotiating a large loan from the Jews of York, to be secured upon certain jewels and lands. Isaac's own share in this transaction was considerable, and he well knew that the Prince's eager desire to bring it to a conclusion would ensure him his protection in the dilemma in which he stood.</p> 
<p>Emboldened by these considerations, the Jew pursued his point, and jostled the Norman Christian, without respect either to his descent, quality, or religion. The complaints of the old man, however, excited the indignation of the bystanders. One of these, a stout well-set yeoman, arrayed in Lincoln green, having twelve arrows stuck in his belt, with a baldric and badge of silver, and a bow of six feet length in his hand, turned short round, and while his countenance, which his constant exposure to weather had rendered brown as a hazel nut, grew darker with anger, he advised the Jew to remember that all the wealth he had acquired by sucking the blood of his miserable victims had but swelled him like a bloated spider, which might be overlooked while he kept in a comer, but would be crushed if it ventured into the light. This intimation, delivered in Norman-English with a firm voice and a stern aspect, made the Jew shrink back; and he would have probably withdrawn himself altogether from a vicinity so dangerous, had not the attention of every one been called to the sudden entrance of Prince John, who at that moment entered the lists, attended by a numerous and gay train, consisting partly of laymen, partly of churchmen, as light in their dress, and as gay in their demeanour, as their companions. Among the latter was the Prior of Jorvaulx, in the most gallant trim which a dignitary of the church could venture to exhibit. Fur and gold were not spared in his garments; and the points of his boots, out-heroding the preposterous fashion of the time, turned up so very far, as to be attached, not to his knees merely, but to his very girdle, and effectually prevented him from putting his foot into the stirrup. This, however, was a slight inconvenience to the gallant Abbot, who, perhaps, even rejoicing in the opportunity to display his accomplished horsemanship before so many spectators, especially of the fair sex, dispensed with the use of these supports to a timid rider. The rest of Prince John's retinue consisted of the favourite leaders of his mercenary troops, some marauding barons and profligate attendants upon the court, with several Knights Templars and Knights of St John.</p> 
<p>It may be here remarked, that the knights of these two orders were accounted hostile to King Richard, having adopted the side of Philip of France in the long train of disputes which took place in Palestine betwixt that monarch and the lion-hearted King of England. It was the well-known consequence of this discord that Richard's repeated victories had been rendered fruitless, his romantic attempts to besiege Jerusalem disappointed, and the fruit of all the glory which he had acquired had dwindled into an uncertain truce with the Sultan Saladin. With the same policy which had dictated the conduct of their brethren in the Holy Land, the Templars and Hospitallers in England and Normandy attached themselves to the faction of Prince John, having little reason to desire the return of Richard to England, or the succession of Arthur, his legitimate heir. For the opposite reason, Prince John hated and contemned the few Saxon families of consequence which subsisted in England, and omitted no opportunity of mortifying and affronting them; being conscious that his person and pretensions were disliked by them, as well as by the greater part of the English commons, who feared farther innovation upon their rights and liberties, from a sovereign of John's licentious and tyrannical disposition.</p> 
<p>Attended by this gallant equipage, himself well mounted, and splendidly dressed in crimson and in gold, bearing upon his hand a falcon, and having his head covered by a rich fur bonnet, adorned with a circle of precious stones, from which his long curled hair escaped and overspread his shoulders, Prince John, upon a grey and high-mettled palfrey, caracoled within the lists at the head of his jovial party, laughing loud with his train, and eyeing with all the boldness of royal criticism the beauties who adorned the lofty galleries.</p> 
<p>Those who remarked in the physiognomy of the Prince a dissolute audacity, mingled with extreme haughtiness and indifference to the feelings of others could not yet deny to his countenance that sort of comeliness which belongs to an open set of features, well formed by nature, modelled by art to the usual rules of courtesy, yet so far frank and honest, that they seemed as if they disclaimed to conceal the natural workings of the soul. Such an expression is often mistaken for manly frankness, when in truth it arises from the reckless indifference of a libertine disposition, conscious of superiority of birth, of wealth, or of some other adventitious advantage, totally unconnected with personal merit. To those who did not think so deeply, and they were the greater number by a hundred to one, the splendour of Prince John's "rheno", (i.e. fur tippet,) the richness of his cloak, lined with the most costly sables, his maroquin boots and golden spurs, together with the grace with which he managed his palfrey, were sufficient to merit clamorous applause.</p> 
<p>In his joyous caracole round the lists, the attention of the Prince was called by the commotion, not yet subsided, which had attended the ambitious movement of Isaac towards the higher places of the assembly. The quick eye of Prince John instantly recognised the Jew, but was much more agreeably attracted by the beautiful daughter of Zion, who, terrified by the tumult, clung close to the arm of her aged father.</p> 
<p>The figure of Rebecca might indeed have compared with the proudest beauties of England, even though it had been judged by as shrewd a connoisseur as Prince John. Her form was exquisitely symmetrical, and was shown to advantage by a sort of Eastern dress, which she wore according to the fashion of the females of her nation. Her turban of yellow silk suited well with the darkness of her complexion. The brilliancy of her eyes, the superb arch of her eyebrows, her well-formed aquiline nose, her teeth as white as pearl, and the profusion of her sable tresses, which, each arranged in its own little spiral of twisted curls, fell down upon as much of a lovely neck and bosom as a simarre of the richest Persian silk, exhibiting flowers in their natural colours embossed upon a purple ground, permitted to be visible ---all these constituted a combination of loveliness, which yielded not to the most beautiful of the maidens who surrounded her. It is true, that of the golden and pearl-studded clasps, which closed her vest from the throat to the waist, the three uppermost were left unfastened on account of the heat, which something enlarged the prospect to which we allude. A diamond necklace, with pendants of inestimable value, were by this means also made more conspicuous. The feather of an ostrich, fastened in her turban by an agraffe set with brilliants, was another distinction of the beautiful Jewess, scoffed and sneered at by the proud dames who sat above her, but secretly envied by those who affected to deride them.</p> 
<p>"By the bald scalp of Abraham," said Prince John, "yonder Jewess must be the very model of that perfection, whose charms drove frantic the wisest king that ever lived! What sayest thou, Prior Aymer?---By the Temple of that wise king, which our wiser brother Richard proved unable to recover, she is the very Bride of the Canticles!"</p> 
<p>"The Rose of Sharon and the Lily of the Valley,"---answered the Prior, in a sort of snuffling tone; "but your Grace must remember she is still but a Jewess."</p> 
<p>"Ay!" added Prince John, without heeding him, "and there is my Mammon of unrighteousness too---the Marquis of Marks, the Baron of Byzants, contesting for place with penniless dogs, whose threadbare cloaks have not a single cross in their pouches to keep the devil from dancing there. By the body of St Mark, my prince of supplies, with his lovely Jewess, shall have a place in the gallery!---What is she, Isaac? Thy wife or thy daughter, that Eastern houri that thou lockest under thy arm as thou wouldst thy treasure-casket?"</p> 
<p>"My daughter Rebecca, so please your Grace," answered Isaac, with a low congee, nothing embarrassed by the Prince's salutation, in which, however, there was at least as much mockery as courtesy.</p> 
<p>"The wiser man thou," said John, with a peal of laughter, in which his gay followers obsequiously joined. "But, daughter or wife, she should be preferred according to her beauty and thy merits.---Who sits above there?" he continued, bending his eye on the gallery. "Saxon churls, lolling at their lazy length!---out upon them!---let them sit close, and make room for my prince of usurers and his lovely daughter. I'll make the hinds know they must share the high places of the synagogue with those whom the synagogue properly belongs to."</p> 
<p>Those who occupied the gallery to whom this injurious and unpolite speech was addressed, were the family of Cedric the Saxon, with that of his ally and kinsman, Athelstane of Coningsburgh, a personage, who, on account of his descent from the last Saxon monarchs of England, was held in the highest respect by all the Saxon natives of the north of England. But with the blood of this ancient royal race, many of their infirmities had descended to Athelstane. He was comely in countenance, bulky and strong in person, and in the flower of his age---yet inanimate in expression, dull-eyed, heavy-browed, inactive and sluggish in all his motions, and so slow in resolution, that the soubriquet of one of his ancestors was conferred upon him, and he was very generally called Athelstane the Unready. His friends, and he had many, who, as well as Cedric, were passionately attached to him, contended that this sluggish temper arose not from want of courage, but from mere want of decision; others alleged that his hereditary vice of drunkenness had obscured his faculties, never of a very acute order, and that the passive courage and meek good-nature which remained behind, were merely the dregs of a character that might have been deserving of praise, but of which all the valuable parts had flown off in the progress of a long course of brutal debauchery.</p> 
<p>It was to this person, such as we have described him, that the Prince addressed his imperious command to make place for Isaac and Rebecca. Athelstane, utterly confounded at an order which the manners and feelings of the times rendered so injuriously insulting, unwilling to obey, yet undetermined how to resist, opposed only the "vis inertiae" to the will of John; and, without stirring or making any motion whatever of obedience, opened his large grey eyes, and stared at the Prince with an astonishment which had in it something extremely ludicrous. But the impatient John regarded it in no such light.</p> 
<p>"The Saxon porker," he said, "is either asleep or minds me not ---Prick him with your lance, De Bracy," speaking to a knight who rode near him, the leader of a band of Free Companions, or Condottieri; that is, of mercenaries belonging to no particular nation, but attached for the time to any prince by whom they were paid. There was a murmur even among the attendants of Prince John; but De Bracy, whose profession freed him from all scruples, extended his long lance over the space which separated the gallery from the lists, and would have executed the commands of the Prince before Athelstane the Unready had recovered presence of mind sufficient even to draw back his person from the weapon, had not Cedric, as prompt as his companion was tardy, unsheathed, with the speed of lightning, the short sword which he wore, and at a single blow severed the point of the lance from the handle. The blood rushed into the countenance of Prince John. He swore one of his deepest oaths, and was about to utter some threat corresponding in violence, when he was diverted from his purpose, partly by his own attendants, who gathered around him conjuring him to be patient, partly by a general exclamation of the crowd, uttered in loud applause of the spirited conduct of Cedric. The Prince rolled his eyes in indignation, as if to collect some safe and easy victim; and chancing to encounter the firm glance of the same archer whom we have already noticed, and who seemed to persist in his gesture of applause, in spite of the frowning aspect which the Prince bent upon him, he demanded his reason for clamouring thus.</p> 
<p>"I always add my hollo," said the yeoman, "when I see a good shot, or a gallant blow."</p> 
<p>"Sayst thou?" answered the Prince; "then thou canst hit the white thyself, I'll warrant."</p> 
<p>"A woodsman's mark, and at woodsman's distance, I can hit," answered the yeoman.</p> 
<p>"And Wat Tyrrel's mark, at a hundred yards," said a voice from behind, but by whom uttered could not be discerned.</p> 
<p>This allusion to the fate of William Rufus, his Relative, at once incensed and alarmed Prince John. He satisfied himself, however, with commanding the men-at-arms, who surrounded the lists, to keep an eye on the braggart, pointing to the yeoman.</p> 
<p>"By St Grizzel," he added, "we will try his own skill, who is so ready to give his voice to the feats of others!"</p> 
<p>"I shall not fly the trial," said the yeoman, with the composure which marked his whole deportment.</p> 
<p>"Meanwhile, stand up, ye Saxon churls," said the fiery Prince; "for, by the light of Heaven, since I have said it, the Jew shall have his seat amongst ye!"</p> 
<p>"By no means, an it please your Grace!---it is not fit for such as we to sit with the rulers of the land," said the Jew; whose ambition for precedence though it had led him to dispute Place with the extenuated and impoverished descendant of the line of Montdidier, by no means stimulated him to an intrusion upon the privileges of the wealthy Saxons.</p> 
<p>"Up, infidel dog when I command you," said Prince John, "or I will have thy swarthy hide stript off, and tanned for horse-furniture."</p> 
<p>Thus urged, the Jew began to ascend the steep and narrow steps which led up to the gallery.</p> 
<p>"Let me see," said the Prince, "who dare stop him," fixing his eye on Cedric, whose attitude intimated his intention to hurl the Jew down headlong.</p> 
<p>The catastrophe was prevented by the clown Wamba, who, springing betwixt his master and Isaac, and exclaiming, in answer to the Prince's defiance, "Marry, that will I!" opposed to the beard of the Jew a shield of brawn, which he plucked from beneath his cloak, and with which, doubtless, he had furnished himself, lest the tournament should have proved longer than his appetite could endure abstinence. Finding the abomination of his tribe opposed to his very nose, while the Jester, at the same time, flourished his wooden sword above his head, the Jew recoiled, missed his footing, and rolled down the steps,---an excellent jest to the spectators, who set up a loud laughter, in which Prince John and his attendants heartily joined.</p> 
<p>"Deal me the prize, cousin Prince," said Wamba; "I have vanquished my foe in fair fight with sword and shield," he added, brandishing the brawn in one hand and the wooden sword in the other.</p> 
<p>"Who, and what art thou, noble champion?" said Prince John, still laughing.</p> 
<p>"A fool by right of descent," answered the Jester; "I am Wamba, the son of Witless, who was the son of Weatherbrain, who was the son of an Alderman."</p> 
<p>"Make room for the Jew in front of the lower ring," said Prince John, not unwilling perhaps to, seize an apology to desist from his original purpose; "to place the vanquished beside the victor were false heraldry."</p> 
<p>"Knave upon fool were worse," answered the Jester, "and Jew upon bacon worst of all."</p> 
<p>"Gramercy! good fellow," cried Prince John, "thou pleasest me ---Here, Isaac, lend me a handful of byzants."</p> 
<p>As the Jew, stunned by the request, afraid to refuse, and unwilling to comply, fumbled in the furred bag which hung by his girdle, and was perhaps endeavouring to ascertain how few coins might pass for a handful, the Prince stooped from his jennet and settled Isaac's doubts by snatching the pouch itself from his side; and flinging to Wamba a couple of the gold pieces which it contained, he pursued his career round the lists, leaving the Jew to the derision of those around him, and himself receiving as much applause from the spectators as if he had done some honest and honourable action.</p>

<p>约翰亲王以狮心王的死敌法王胖力二世为奥援，利用各种手段联络奥地利公爵，要公爵尽量延长囚禁王兄的时间，尽管这位兄长对他患重如山。同时他又在国内扩充自己的势力，企图在国王一旦去世后，与合法继承人，约翰的另一个哥哥杰弗里亲王的儿子，布列塔尼的亚瑟公爵争夺王位。大家知道，这篡位后来他如愿以偿了 (注)。这个人本来浅薄．轻浮，不守信义，善于笼络人心，招降纳叛，归附他的不仅有在理查出国期间干尽罪恶勾当，对他心存忌惮的臣子，还有十字军东征后回到本国的大批“骄兵悍将”，这些人在东方罪恶累累，又囊空如洗，生性残暴，现在便指望从国内的动乱中趁火打劫，捞取利益。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)亚瑟于1196年（理查去世前）被法王腓力二世俘获，约翰登基后，把他囚禁在鲁昂，1203年派人将他秘密处死，这样扫除了他继承王位的一切障碍。</p> 
<p>造成社会动荡、人心不安的原因还不仅这些；封建贵族的压迫和森林法规的残酷措施，也驱使许多人无家可归成为亡命之徒，他们啸聚在山林和荒野中，与官府和法律相抗衡。那些贵族又在各自的城堡内大兴土木，构筑工事，妄图在自己的领地上称王称霸，他们手下的部队，与公然以劫掠为生的土匪不相上下。为了豢养他们的家丁仆从，维持他们的傲慢自大所需要的豪华生活和阔绰排场，他们不得不靠高利贷从犹太人那里获取大量借款，这些借款又像无法治愈的痈疽一样侵袭着他们的家业，这样，他们的唯一希望就是天下大乱，给他们提供机会，让他们用蛮横无理的手段胁迫债主，把债务一笔勾销。</p> 
<p>这种风雨飘摇的时局，给人民带来的灾难是深重的，他们不仅为眼前忧心忡忡，对未来更充满了恐惧。此外，一种带有危险性质的传染病，当时正在英国蔓延，不清洁的环境，下层阶级不良的食物和恶劣的居住条件，更增加了它的危害，这对人民真是雪上加霜，它使许多人丧失了生命，然而幸存者却羡慕他们的命运，因为未来的灾难对他们已无可奈何了。</p> 
<p>但是尽管有这些深重的灾难，穷人和富人，老百姓和贵族，对即将来临的比武大会还是兴致勃勃，因为这是那个时代里万众瞩目的大事，就像马德里的市民哪怕衣食不周，没钱支付家庭开支，也不肯错过斗牛大会的盛举一样。不论工作或疾病，都不能阻止男女老少前去一睹盛况。这场所谓交战定在莱斯特郡阿什贝镇举行，据说参加的都是第一流的武士，约翰亲王也要亲临观战，因此它吸引了千万人的注意，到了比赛举行的那天早上，各个阶层的人便像潮水一般涌向那里。</p> 
<p>这个地点富有独特的传奇色彩。它离阿什贝镇不到一英里，那里有一片树林，树林旁边是一块广阔的草地，周围风景优美，绿草如茵，一边有森林环抱，另一边是错落不齐的一些株树，其中几株还生得相当高大。这里的地形好像是专为比武开辟的，地面从四周向平地缓缓倾斜，平地用牢固的木栅围住，便形成了一块四分之一英里长，大约一半那么宽的比武场。它的形状是长方形的，只是四角为了围观的方便，已整修得相当圆了。比武者的出入口位在场地的南北两端，那里设有坚固的木门，它可容两个骑士并肩入场。每扇门边有两个典礼官带领六名号手和六名随员驻守，还有一队全副武装的士兵负责维持秩序，查验参加比武的骑士的身分。</p> 
<p>南面出入口外有一块天然的高地，它构成了一个平台，上面搭起了五个豪华的帐篷，前面飘着一些褐色和黑色的三角旗，那是充当挑战者的五个骑士选定的颜色。帐篷用的绳索也是同样颜色。每个帐篷前面挂着占有这帐篷的骑士的盾牌，他的扈从站在它旁边，他穿得奇形怪状，像一个野人或穴居人，反正任何不可思议的装束都可以，只要符合他主人的趣味，或者他在这场比赛中希望扮演的角色。(注1)中央那座帐篷作为荣誉席位，归布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔所有，他在骑士比武中历来享有盛誉，又与参加这次比赛的其他骑士关系密切，因此尽管他到得较迟，一到便受到热烈欢迎，被挑战者们拥戴为首脑和领袖。他的帐篷的一边是牛面将军雷金纳德和菲利普·马尔沃辛的帐篷，另一边一个帐篷是休·格兰梅斯尼尔的，这是这一带的一个贵族，他的祖先在征服者威廉及其子红脸威廉(注2)两朝担任过宫内大臣。第五个帐篷属于拉尔夫·维庞特，他是耶路撒冷的圣约翰骑士团骑士，在阿什贝镇附近一个名叫希瑟的地方拥有一些古老的领地。从入口进入比武场有一条坡度不大的道路，它十码宽，另一头通向帐篷所在的平台。它的两边筑有坚固的栅栏，在帐篷前面形成一个大广场，整个场地都有士兵担任警戒。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注1)这种光怪陆离的服饰，据说便是后来纹章中出现扶持盾形纹章的兽形图像的根据。——原注按纹章在中世纪欧洲作为个人或家族的独特标志，具有各种复杂的图案，盾形纹章是它的主要部分，它的两旁往往有两只直立的野兽扶持着它。</p> 
<p>(注2)红脸威廉，征服者威廉的儿子，称威廉二世，1087—1100年在位。</p> 
<p>北面入场的通道也差不多，大约三十英尺宽，它的末端是一大片围场，专供有意进入比武场，与挑战者交手的骑士使用。它后面也设有几座帐篷，里边备有供应他们的各种食物，还有修铝甲的，钉马蹄铁的，以及其他杂役，一旦需要，这些人随时可以提供帮助。</p> 
<p>比武场外围的一部分地方建立了临时看台，台上挂了帷幔，铺了地毯，还为贵族和他们的宝眷准备了座垫，因为这是专供他们观看比武的。看台和比武场之间的狭长地带，是供自由民(注)，以及比普通老百姓略高一等的观众使用的，可以比作戏院中的池座。大量低贱的下等人只能挤在大片青草丛生的土埂上，这是专供他们用的，不过凭借较高的地势，从看台顶上眺望比武，也能看得一清二楚。除此以外，也有不少人爬在四周的树顶上；甚至较远的教堂尖顶上也挤满了观众。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)自由民，从前英国的一个阶层，介于奴隶和地主之间，如小土地私有者和自耕农等。</p> 
<p>对整个场面需要补充的只是，在比武场东边有一个看台，它位在正中，因此面对着比武时双方交锋的地点，它比其他看台都高，装饰也更豪华，台上设有绣着王室纹章的光彩夺目的宝座和华盖。那是为约翰亲王和他的随员准备的，扈卫、少年侍从和卫士穿着华丽的制服，侍候在这尊贵的场所周围。王家看台对面还有一个看台，它同样高度，矗立在比武场的西侧；它不如亲王的看台豪华，但也许比它更显得五彩缤纷。一队非常漂亮的、精选出来的少男少女，穿着红红绿绿、鲜艳花哨的服饰，环立在一张同样色彩鲜艳的椅子周围。各种形状不一的旗子，有的画着受伤的心、燃烧的心或流血的心，有的画着弓箭或者一般象征爱神的胜利的图样，罗列在那里，旗子中间有一条绣宇的横幅，它告诉观众，这是专为“美和爱的女王”设置的荣誉席位。至于“美和爱的女王”究竟是谁，目前还无从猜测。</p> 
<p>这时形形色色的观众已蜂拥而至，正在抢占各自的位置，至于谁有权取得哪个位置，自然少不了发生许多争吵。有些争执，维持秩序的军士只消三言两语便可解决；较难解决的，便得做出仿佛要动用战斧或刀剑弹压的样子，才能平息。也有一些气焰更加嚣张的人相持不下，这就只得由典礼官或两个警卫督察来裁决了。担任警卫督察的是威廉·怀维尔和斯蒂芬·马提瓦尔，他们全副武装，骑着高头大马，不断在场子里来回巡逻，迫使观众保持良好的秩序。</p> 
<p>看台上逐渐挤满了骑士和贵族，他们都身穿礼眼，但这些豪华富丽的长袍，夹在夫人小姐们更鲜艳、更华丽的服饰中，便显得相形见细了。从人数看，妇女甚至比男人更多，尽管一般认为这是充满血腥味的危险娱乐，不会给她们带来多大乐趣，她们仍趋之若骛。看台下面的那片空地，也很快挤满了殷实的城乡平民，他们比绅士略低一等，由于自卑、贫穷或身分不明，不敢僭取更高的席位。不言而喻，在这些人中间，是最容易发生互不服气、相持不下的争吵的。</p> 
<p>“不信基督的狗，”一个老人在讲，他的袍子破旧，说明了他的穷苦，然而他佩带的剑、匕首和金链子，却证明他有一定的身分。“一只母狼崽子！你竟敢冲撞一个基督徒，蒙迪迪耶家族的一个诺曼绅士？”</p> 
<p>这粗暴的训斥针对的不是别人，便是我们的老相识以撒，他今天穿了镶花边的皮袍，不仅阔绰，甚至显得豪华。他与他的女儿，美丽的丽贝卡在一起，他们是在阿什贝会面的，现在他要为她在看台下面的前排找一个位置；女儿挽住了父亲的胳臂，看到他不顾一切往前挤，引起了众人的不满，不禁非常害怕。但是以撒虽然在其他场合相当胆小，这我们已经看到，现在却觉得他没什么好怕的，这不是在一般的娱乐场所，也不是贪婪而恶毒的贵族集中的地方，谁都可以任意欺侮他。在这种群众汇集的大会上，犹太人处在一般法律的保护下，哪怕这个信念并不可靠，在这样的场合，通常总有几个贵族出于自身的利益，愿意充当他们的保护人。至于目前，以撒觉得比平时更有信心，困为他知道，约翰亲王当时正与约克郡的犹太人磋商，要用珠宝和土地作抵押，向他们借一笔巨款。在这笔交易中，以撒占了很大一份，他完全清楚，约翰亲王急于达成协议，因此他万一遇到麻烦，肯定可以得到亲王的保护。</p> 
<p>在这些考虑的鼓舞下，犹太人大胆向前挤，冲撞了诺曼基督徒也不怕，后者的出身、地位或宗教都不在他的话下。然而老人的埋怨引起了旁观者的愤怒。其中有一个身强力壮的自耕农，穿一身浅绿色衣服，腰带里插着十二支箭，身上挂着肩带和银徽章，手里拿着六英尺长的一张弓，摹地旋转身来，露出那张久经风吹日晒、本来已像榛子一般乌油油的、现在又因愤怒更变得阴暗可怕的脸，教训犹太人别忘记，他的全部财产都是靠盘剥穷人，吸他们的血获得的，他这只大腹便便的蜘蛛要是躲在角落里，也就算了，如果想跑到日光中来惹是生非，那么非给掐死不可。这番话是用诺曼英语讲的，口气强硬，态度严厉，使犹太人不由得缩了回去。也许他本来已打算离开这个是非之地，到别处去，然而正在这时，每个人的注意力都被约翰亲王的突然莅临吸引住了；大家发现，亲王已来到比武场，后面跟着一大群服饰华丽的贵人，其中一部分是官员，一部分是教士，但后者的服饰同样鲜艳，举止也同样轻浮，与他们的同伴不相上下。其中一人便是茹尔沃修道院的院长，他的打扮已极尽奢华之能事，达到了教会所允许的最大限度。他的衣服不惜用裘皮和金银装点得富丽堂皇，那双靴子的靴尖也大大超过了当时的荒谬式样，向上高高翘起，不仅达到膝盖，甚至达到了腰带那里，其结果便是他的脚无法伸进马镫。然而对于这位风流修士说来，这小小的不便算不得什么，也许他正好趁此机会；在众多观众，尤其是太太小姐们面前炫耀他熟练的骑术，证明他用不到胆小的骑手所需要的那些脚镫。约翰亲王的扈从还包括他的雇佣兵中一些得宠的军官，他的朝廷上了些为非作歹的贵族和荒淫无耻的侍卫，此外便是圣殿骑士团和圣约翰骑士团的几个骑士。</p> 
<p>不妨在这儿说明一下，这两个骑士团是公然与理查王为敌的；在巴勒斯坦期间，法王腓力二世和英国的狮心王发生许多龃龉，它们却始终站在法王一边。大家知道，这类磨擦的结果，便是理查的一再胜利都徒劳无益，他围攻耶路撒冷的雄心壮志无从实现，他所取得的一切辉煌成果也化为乌有，最后只得与萨拉丁苏丹签订了并不可靠的停战协议。这两个骑士团在英国和诺曼底也奉行它们在圣地制定的方针，拥戴约翰亲王一派；它们从本身的利益出发，不希望理查回国，如果他去世，也不支持他的合法继承人亚瑟。出于这种对抗，约翰亲王仇恨和鄙视英国残存的不多几个举足轻重的撒克逊家族，利用一切机会打击和削弱它们；他意识到，他本人和他的野心在这些家族中不得人心，大部分英国老百姓也不支持他，他们担心，约翰这么一个胡作非为、专横暴虐的人登上王位，必然会进一步侵犯他们的权利，损害他们的自由。</p> 
<p>在这群达官贵人的簇拥下，约翰亲王得意扬扬地骑在一匹灰色骏马上，他服饰华贵，身上不是红的便是金的，胳臂上擎着一只猎鹰，头上戴一顶贵重的皮毛帽子，它的周围镶着一圈宝石，长长的鬈发从帽檐下直披到肩上。他带着这些兴高彩烈的臣子，正在比武场上巡行，一边与他们大声谈笑，一边以帝王的轩昂气概打量着高耸的看台上那许多花枝招展的美女。</p> 
<p>有人在亲王的容貌中看到了荒淫无耻、骄横跋扈、对别人的感情漠不关心等等表现，然而这些人仍不能否认，他的脸带有一张开朗的面貌所天然具有的动人气质，尽管在人力的制约下，它还能适应文明礼貌的一般要求，然而它显得那么坦率和诚实，仿佛它在公然宣称，它不屑隐瞒灵魂的真实活动。这种表情往往被误认为便是胸怀坦荡的勇气，实际这只是一种无所顾忌、满不在乎的心情的流露，因为这个人意识到，就出身、财富和其他后天的优越条件而论，他都高人一等，尽管这一切都与个人的品质无关。然而想得这么深入的，一百个人中不过一个，对于大多数人而言，约翰亲王的豪华气派，他的裘皮披肩，他那件贵重的紫貂长袍，那双摩洛哥皮靴于，那金踢马刺，那骑在马上的悠闲风度，已足以赢得人们的大声喝彩和欢呼了。</p> 
<p>亲王正在比武场上洋洋得意地巡视时，以撒野心勃勃企图争夺较高席位引起的风波，还没有平息，以致也惊动了亲王。后者那双敏锐的眼睛一下子认出了犹太人，不过真正吸引他，引起他兴趣的，还是犹太人那位美丽的女儿，她在骚乱中正吓得什么似的，紧靠在老父亲的胳臂上。</p> 
<p>丽贝卡的姿色，哪伯让约翰亲王这么一位精明的鉴赏家来评判，确实也可以与英国最自豪的美女媲美。她的身材优美匀称，那套东方服饰按照她本族妇女的方式穿在身上，更使她增色不少。她的黄绸头巾与她略显黝黑的皮肤正好相称。她那对明亮的眼睛，那两条弯弯的娥眉，那高高的鼻梁，那珍珠般洁白的牙齿，那一头乌油油的鬈发——它们像一串串形态各异的螺旋形发辫，从头顶滚滚而下，披在可爱的头颈上，披在色彩绚丽的波斯绸外衣所露出的胸前，也披在这件紫色外衣上那些像真花一样鲜艳的花朵上——总之，这一切构成了一幅悦目的图画，使她显得那么可爱，哪怕她周围最美丽的少女也无法与她相比。确实，她由于热，把罩在外面的那件坎肩上从领口到腰部的一排镶珍珠的金钮扣，解开了上面三颗，这才扩大了我们前面提到的那种效果。那串钻石项链和项链上那些十分珍贵的挂件，也因为这样才变得更加显目。一根鸵鸟翎毛，用一只镶宝石的搭扣别在头巾上，成了美丽的犹太姑娘的另一与众不同之处，这遭到了坐在上面的那些傲慢的夫人的讥刺和嘲笑，但是她们装得瞧不起这些装饰品，心里却羡慕不已。</p> 
<p>“我可以凭亚伯拉罕的秃头起誓，”约翰亲王说道，“那个犹太小妞儿生得天姿国色，一定就是害得古往今来那位最聪明的国王(注)神魂颠倒的美人的化身！艾默长老，你说怎么样？我可以凭那个大智大慧的国王的神殿，也就是我那位自作聪明的弟兄理查终于未能攻占的圣殿起誓，她便是《雅歌》中的那个新娘！”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)指以色列国王所罗门，《圣经》中把他说成最聪明的国王，耶路撒冷的圣殿便是他所建。据说他还善于写诗，《圣经》冲的《雅歌》即他所写。《雅歌》是新郎新娘互相唱和的情歌集，那位新娘自称“我是沙仑的玫瑰花，谷中的百合花”（见《雅歌》第2章）。</p> 
<p>“也就是沙仑的玫瑰花和谷中的百合花，”长老答道，声音有些不太自然，“但是殿下不可忘记，她仍然只是一个犹太小妞儿。”</p> 
<p>“啊！”约翰亲王又道，没有理睬他，“我那位不义的财神爷也在那儿，这个马克(注)侯爵，这个金圆男爵正跟不名一文的穷光蛋争位子呢，这些人穿得破破烂烂，袋子里没一个子儿，魔鬼自然不怕他们，要跟他们纠缠。好啦，看在神圣的马克份上，我的供给大臣和他可爱的女儿，应该在看台上占有一席位置！以撒，她是谁？你像挟你的珠宝匣子那样挟在你胳臂下的那个东方仙女，她是你的妻子还是你的女儿？”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)当时在英国和欧洲通行的一种货币单位。</p> 
<p>“禀告殿下，她是我的女儿丽贝卡，”以撤回答，把腰弯得低低的；尽管亲王的问话在客气中，也包含着同样多的调笑，他一点也不觉得刺耳。</p> 
<p>“你是个更聪明的人，”约翰说，一边哈哈大笑，那些趋炎附势的随员赶紧响应，也跟着他笑个不住。“但不论是女儿或妻子，凭她的美貌和你的钱财，她理应得到优待。坐在上面的是谁？”他继续道，向看台上打量了一下。“那些撒克逊乡巴佬大模大样的，好不自在！去他们的！叫他们靠拢一些，给我们的高利贷伯爵和他可爱的女儿让个位子。我得叫这些乡巴佬明白，有权坐在犹太会堂里的人，也有权与他们一起占有这些体面的席位、”</p> 
<p>这些盛气凌人、毫不客气的话是针对看台上的人说的，当时坐在那里的便是撒克逊人塞德里克一家和科宁斯堡的阿特尔斯坦一家，后者是他志同道合的亲戚，从血统上看，也是英国最后几代撒克逊国王的后裔，在北方深得一切撒克逊人的尊敬。但是这个古老王室所固有的一切缺点，也与它的血统一起传给了阿特尔斯坦。他相貌清秀，身体魁梧强壮，正处在盛年时期；然而脸上表情呆板，目光迟钝，神色消沉，举止行动都显得没有朝气，萎靡不振，犹豫不决，他的祖先的一个诨号正可用在他的身上(注)，因此一般人都称他优柔寡断的阿特尔斯坦。他的亲族很多，他们都像塞德里克一样热烈拥护他，认为他的懒散并非由于缺乏勇气，只是由于缺乏决断。还有些人认为，先天遗传的酗酒恶习，使他本来不太灵敏的头脑变得更加迟缓了，他所保留的那一点无所作为的胆量和温厚随和的天性，只是他性格中的糟粕，这种性格本来也许是应该得到赞扬的，可惜的只是在长期纵饮无度的过程中，一切难能可贵的部分都消失殆尽了。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)指英国盎格鲁一撒克逊王朝的一个国王埃塞尔莱德二世，公元979—1016年在位。他在丹麦人的入侵中表现得软弱无力，屡战屡败，因此被冠以“优柔寡断”的诨名。</p> 
<p>约翰亲王便是对着我们所描写的这个人，发出他专横的命令，要他给以撒和丽贝卡让位的。这个命令来得这么粗暴，这么不合时宜，把阿特尔斯坦弄糊涂了，他不想照办，又迟疑不决，不知该怎么对付，只得祭起“消极抵制”的法宝跟约翰周旋；他坐在那儿一动不动，既不服从也不反抗，只是瞪起了一对灰色大眼睛望着亲王，那副惊讶的神色叫人觉得啼笑皆非。然而暴躁的约翰却不想一笑置之。</p> 
<p>“这只撒克逊猪莫非在睡觉，或者不把我放在眼里，”他说。“德布拉西，用你的长枪刺他一下。”这是对他身旁一个骑士说的，这骑士是一支所谓“自由部队”，也就是不属于任何国家，只要谁出钱就给谁卖命的雇佣兵部队的队长。约翰亲王的随员中响起了一阵窃窃私语声，但是德布拉西的职业使他毫不犹豫，当即举起长枪，向比武场和看台之间的空中刺去，也许，在优柔寡断的阿特尔斯坦恢复清醒的头脑，明白是怎么回事，抽回身子以前，那武器便可到达他身上，完成亲王的命令，可是塞德里克不像他的同伴那么迟疑不决，顿时以闪电的速度拨出身边佩带的短剑，猛然一击，把那支长枪的枪头砍掉了。血涌上了约翰亲王的脸。他发出了怒不可遏的咒骂，正要下令作出同样粗暴的反应，这时不仅簇拥在他身边的随员提醒他要保持冷静，群众也对塞德里克的果断行动大声喝彩，以致欢声雷动，转移了亲王的注意力。他怒冲冲地转动着眼睛，似乎想寻找一只可以供他出气的、没有反抗能力的替罪羊；他正好发现了我们提到过的那个弓箭手的坚定目光，这人似乎根本不把亲王的横眉竖目放在眼里，坚持要把喝彩进行到底；于是亲王要他解释，他这么大声嚷嚷是何道理。</p> 
<p>“我看到射出的好箭，使出的好剑术，总要喝几声彩，”自耕农回答道。</p> 
<p>“是这样吗？”亲王又问。“这么说来，你也射得一手好箭啦？”</p> 
<p>“凡是在猎手的射程以内，他能射中的目标，我也能射中，”庄户人回答。</p> 
<p>“那么你也像沃特·蒂雷尔(注)一样，可以在一百码以外射中目标啦，”一个声音从后面发出，但讲话的是谁，已分辨不清。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)威廉二世（红睑威廉）常与贵族发生争执，1100年他在出猎时被背后射来的冷箭射死，据说这箭是一个名叫沃特·蒂雷尔的贵族射的。</p> 
<p>这句话涉及了约翰亲王的祖先红脸威廉，使他不禁吃了一惊，顿时怒火中烧。不过他还是忍住了，只是指指自耕农，命令比武场周围的士兵监视这个讲大话的人。</p> 
<p>“凭圣格里泽尔起誓，”他又道，“既然他对别人的武艺这么喜欢喝彩，我们便得试试他自己的本领！”</p> 
<p>“要试就试，我不会逃走，”庄户人说，他的神态始终显得那么安详。</p> 
<p>“好啦，站起来，你们这些撒克逊乡巴佬，”余怒未息的亲王又道，“老天爷作证，既然我说过了，这个犹太人就得坐在你们中间！”</p> 
<p>“千万别这样，请殿下息怒！我们这样的人跟统治这个国土的人坐在一起是不适宜的，”犹太人说，他刚才气势汹汹，甚至吵架也在所不计，要跟蒙迪迪耶家族那些失势的、破落的后代争夺位置，但是决不想与富裕的撒克逊人挑起争端，侵犯他们的特权。</p> 
<p>“上去，犹太佬，这是我的命令，”约翰亲王说，“否则我就剥下你这层黑皮肤，拿它来鞣制马鞍子！”</p> 
<p>犹太人迫不得已，只能踹着又陡又窄的梯子，往看台上爬。</p> 
<p>“我倒要看看，有谁敢阻挡他！”亲王说，把眼睛盯住了塞德里克，后者那副架势仿佛打算把犹太人摔下看台似的。</p> 
<p>多亏小丑汪八的打岔阻止了这场风波，他一个箭步跳到主人和以撒中间，似乎在回答亲王的威胁，喊道：“好吧，我不在乎！”一边掏出一只腌猪腿，把它当盾牌似的挡在犹太人的胡于前面；原来这是他怕比武大会开得太长，超过了肠胃的忍受能力，特地藏在袍子里面准备着的。犹太人看到他的宗族忌讳的这块食物，举到他的鼻子前面，已经大惊失色，又看到小丑举起一把木剑在他头顶挥舞，不禁连连倒退，以致一脚踩空，滚下了梯子——这对观众是一出有趣的闹剧，大家顿时哈哈大笑，约翰亲王和他的随从也转怒为喜，参加了这场笑声大合唱。</p> 
<p>“亲王老兄，应该给我发奖啦，”汪八说。“我用剑和盾光明正大地打败了我的敌人。”他一口手举起猪肉，另一只手拿着木剑挥个不停。</p> 
<p>“我的武士，你是谁，是干什么的？”约翰亲王问，仍在哈哈大笑。</p> 
<p>“一个享有世袭权利的小丑，”滑稽人答道，“名叫汪八语，乃白痴之子呆子之孙，不过我爷爷的父亲可县当官的”</p> 
<p>“好啦，那只得在台下前排，给犹太人腾出一个位置了，”约翰亲王说，也许这场闹剧正好给他解了围，给了他从原来的意图后退的借口，“让战败者与战胜者坐在一起，这不符合比武的规则。”</p> 
<p>“让坏蛋坐在傻瓜之上更糟，”小丑应道，“让犹太佬坐在乡巴佬之上，则是一切中最糟的一着。”</p> 
<p>“多谢！你这小子不赖，”约翰亲王大声说，“我喜欢你。现在，以撒，借一把金币给我。”</p> 
<p>犹太人听得这要求愣住了，既不敢拒绝又不愿服从，在腰带上挂的皮毛袋子里掏摸，也许是在琢磨，究竟多少金币算得“一把”，但是亲王从马上弯下身子，替以撒解决了难题，从他手中夺下钱袋，掏出两枚金币丢给了汪八，便带着钱袋扬长而去，继续在比武场上巡视，听任犹太人遭到周围人的嘲笑；他自己却沾沾自喜，获得了观众一迭连声的喝彩，仿佛他完成了一次公正而光荣的行动。</p>
