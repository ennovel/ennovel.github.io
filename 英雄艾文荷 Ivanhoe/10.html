<p>In the midst of Prince John's cavalcade, he suddenly stopt, and appealing to the Prior of Jorvaulx, declared the principal business of the day had been forgotten.</p> 
<p>"By my halidom," said he, "we have forgotten, Sir Prior, to name the fair Sovereign of Love and of Beauty, by whose white hand the palm is to be distributed. For my part, I am liberal in my ideas, and I care not if I give my vote for the black-eyed Rebecca."</p> 
<p>"Holy Virgin," answered the Prior, turning up his eyes in horror, "a Jewess!---We should deserve to be stoned out of the lists; and I am not yet old enough to be a martyr. Besides, I swear by my patron saint, that she is far inferior to the lovely Saxon, Rowena."</p> 
<p>"Saxon or Jew," answered the Prince, "Saxon or Jew, dog or hog, what matters it? I say, name Rebecca, were it only to mortify the Saxon churls."</p> 
<p>A murmur arose even among his own immediate attendants.</p> 
<p>"This passes a jest, my lord," said De Bracy; "no knight here will lay lance in rest if such an insult is attempted."</p> 
<p>"It is the mere wantonness of insult," said one of the oldest and most important of Prince John's followers, Waldemar Fitzurse, "and if your Grace attempt it, cannot but prove ruinous to your projects."</p> 
<p>"I entertained you, sir," said John, reining up his palfrey haughtily, "for my follower, but not for my counsellor."</p> 
<p>"Those who follow your Grace in the paths which you tread," said Waldemar, but speaking in a low voice, "acquire the right of counsellors; for your interest and safety are not more deeply gaged than their own."</p> 
<p>From the tone in which this was spoken, John saw the necessity of acquiescence "I did but jest," he said; "and you turn upon me like so many adders! Name whom you will, in the fiend's name, and please yourselves."</p> 
<p>"Nay, nay," said De Bracy, "let the fair sovereign's throne remain unoccupied, until the conqueror shall be named, and then let him choose the lady by whom it shall be filled. It will add another grace to his triumph, and teach fair ladies to prize the love of valiant knights, who can exalt them to such distinction."</p> 
<p>"If Brian de Bois-Guilbert gain the prize," said the Prior, "I will gage my rosary that I name the Sovereign of Love and Beauty."</p> 
<p>"Bois-Guilbert," answered De Bracy, "is a good lance; but there are others around these lists, Sir Prior, who will not fear to encounter him."</p> 
<p>"Silence, sirs," said Waldemar, "and let the Prince assume his seat. The knights and spectators are alike impatient, the time advances, and highly fit it is that the sports should commence."</p> 
<p>Prince John, though not yet a monarch, had in Waldemar Fitzurse all the inconveniences of a favourite minister, who, in serving his sovereign, must always do so in his own way. The Prince acquiesced, however, although his disposition was precisely of that kind which is apt to be obstinate upon trifles, and, assuming his throne, and being surrounded by his followers, gave signal to the heralds to proclaim the laws of the tournament, which were briefly as follows:</p> 
<p>First, the five challengers were to undertake all comers.</p> 
<p>Secondly, any knight proposing to combat, might, if he pleased, select a special antagonist from among the challengers, by touching his shield. If he did so with the reverse of his lance, the trial of skill was made with what were called the arms of courtesy, that is, with lances at whose extremity a piece of round flat board was fixed, so that no danger was encountered, save from the shock of the horses and riders. But if the shield was touched with the sharp end of the lance, the combat was understood to be at "outrance", that is, the knights were to fight with sharp weapons, as in actual battle.</p> 
<p>Thirdly, when the knights present had accomplished their vow, by each of them breaking five lances, the Prince was to declare the victor in the first day's tourney, who should receive as prize a warhorse of exquisite beauty and matchless strength; and in addition to this reward of valour, it was now declared, he should have the peculiar honour of naming the Queen of Love and Beauty, by whom the prize should be given on the ensuing day.</p> 
<p>Fourthly, it was announced, that, on the second day, there should be a general tournament, in which all the knights present, who were desirous to win praise, might take part; and being divided into two bands of equal numbers, might fight it out manfully, until the signal was given by Prince John to cease the combat. The elected Queen of Love and Beauty was then to crown the knight whom the Prince should adjudge to have borne himself best in this second day, with a coronet composed of thin gold plate, cut into the shape of a laurel crown. On this second day the knightly games ceased. But on that which was to follow, feats of archery, of bull-baiting, and other popular amusements, were to be practised, for the more immediate amusement of the populace. In this manner did Prince John endeavour to lay the foundation of a popularity, which he was perpetually throwing down by some inconsiderate act of wanton aggression upon the feelings and prejudices of the people.</p> 
<p>The lists now presented a most splendid spectacle. The sloping galleries were crowded with all that was noble, great, wealthy, and beautiful in the northern and midland parts of England; and the contrast of the various dresses of these dignified spectators, rendered the view as gay as it was rich, while the interior and lower space, filled with the substantial burgesses and yeomen of merry England, formed, in their more plain attire, a dark fringe, or border, around this circle of brilliant embroidery, relieving, and, at the same time, setting off its splendour.</p> 
<p>The heralds finished their proclamation with their usual cry of "Largesse, largesse, gallant knights!" and gold and silver pieces were showered on them from the galleries, it being a high point of chivalry to exhibit liberality towards those whom the age accounted at once the secretaries and the historians of honour. The bounty of the spectators was acknowledged by the customary shouts of "Love of Ladies---Death of Champions---Honour to the Generous---Glory to the Brave!" To which the more humble spectators added their acclamations, and a numerous band of trumpeters the flourish of their martial instruments. When these sounds had ceased, the heralds withdrew from the lists in gay and glittering procession, and none remained within them save the marshals of the field, who, armed cap-a-pie, sat on horseback, motionless as statues, at the opposite ends of the lists. Meantime, the enclosed space at the northern extremity of the lists, large as it was, was now completely crowded with knights desirous to prove their skill against the challengers, and, when viewed from the galleries, presented the appearance of a sea of waving plumage, intermixed with glistening helmets, and tall lances, to the extremities of which were, in many cases, attached small pennons of about a span's breadth, which, fluttering in the air as the breeze caught them, joined with the restless motion of the feathers to add liveliness to the scene.</p> 
<p>At length the barriers were opened, and five knights, chosen by lot, advanced slowly into the area; a single champion riding in front, and the other four following in pairs. All were splendidly armed, and my Saxon authority (in the Wardour Manuscript) records at great length their devices, their colours, and the embroidery of their horse trappings. It is unnecessary to be particular on these subjects. To borrow lines from a contemporary poet, who has written but too little:</p> 
<p>"The knights are dust, And their good swords are rust, Their souls are with the saints, we trust."*</p> 
<p>* These lines are part of an unpublished poem, by Coleridge, * whose Muse so often tantalizes with fragments which * indicate her powers, while the manner in which she flings * them from her betrays her caprice, yet whose unfinished * sketches display more talent than the laboured * masterpieces of others.</p> 
<p>Their escutcheons have long mouldered from the walls of their castles. Their castles themselves are but green mounds and shattered ruins---the place that once knew them, knows them no more---nay, many a race since theirs has died out and been forgotten in the very land which they occupied, with all the authority of feudal proprietors and feudal lords. What, then, would it avail the reader to know their names, or the evanescent symbols of their martial rank!</p> 
<p>Now, however, no whit anticipating the oblivion which awaited their names and feats, the champions advanced through the lists, restraining their fiery steeds, and compelling them to move slowly, while, at the same time, they exhibited their paces, together with the grace and dexterity of the riders. As the procession entered the lists, the sound of a wild Barbaric music was heard from behind the tents of the challengers, where the performers were concealed. It was of Eastern origin, having been brought from the Holy Land; and the mixture of the cymbals and bells seemed to bid welcome at once, and defiance, to the knights as they advanced. With the eyes of an immense concourse of spectators fixed upon them, the five knights advanced up the platform upon which the tents of the challengers stood, and there separating themselves, each touched slightly, and with the reverse of his lance, the shield of the antagonist to whom he wished to oppose himself. The lower orders of spectators in general---nay, many of the higher class, and it is even said several of the ladies, were rather disappointed at the champions choosing the arms of courtesy. For the same sort of persons, who, in the present day, applaud most highly the deepest tragedies, were then interested in a tournament exactly in proportion to the danger incurred by the champions engaged.</p> 
<p>Having intimated their more pacific purpose, the champions retreated to the extremity of the lists, where they remained drawn up in a line; while the challengers, sallying each from his pavilion, mounted their horses, and, headed by Brian de Bois-Guilbert, descended from the platform, and opposed themselves individually to the knights who had touched their respective shields.</p> 
<p>At the flourish of clarions and trumpets, they started out against each other at full gallop; and such was the superior dexterity or good fortune of the challengers, that those opposed to Bois-Guilbert, Malvoisin, and Front-de-Boeuf, rolled on the ground. The antagonist of Grantmesnil, instead of bearing his lance-point fair against the crest or the shield of his enemy, swerved so much from the direct line as to break the weapon athwart the person of his opponent---a circumstance which was accounted more disgraceful than that of being actually unhorsed; because the latter might happen from accident, whereas the former evinced awkwardness and want of management of the weapon and of the horse. The fifth knight alone maintained the honour of his party, and parted fairly with the Knight of St John, both splintering their lances without advantage on either side.</p> 
<p>The shouts of the multitude, together with the acclamations of the heralds, and the clangour of the trumpets, announced the triumph of the victors and the defeat of the vanquished. The former retreated to their pavilions, and the latter, gathering themselves up as they could, withdrew from the lists in disgrace and dejection, to agree with their victors concerning the redemption of their arms and their horses, which, according to the laws of the tournament, they had forfeited. The fifth of their number alone tarried in the lists long enough to be greeted by the applauses of the spectators, amongst whom he retreated, to the aggravation, doubtless, of his companions' mortification.</p> 
<p>A second and a third party of knights took the field; and although they had various success, yet, upon the whole, the advantage decidedly remained with the challengers, not one of whom lost his seat or swerved from his charge---misfortunes which befell one or two of their antagonists in each encounter. The spirits, therefore, of those opposed to them, seemed to be considerably damped by their continued success. Three knights only appeared on the fourth entry, who, avoiding the shields of Bois-Guilbert and Front-de-Boeuf, contented themselves with touching those of the three other knights, who had not altogether manifested the same strength and dexterity. This politic selection did not alter the fortune of the field, the challengers were still successful: one of their antagonists was overthrown, and both the others failed in the "attaint",*</p> 
<p>* This term of chivalry, transferred to the law, gives the * phrase of being attainted of treason.</p> 
<p>that is, in striking the helmet and shield of their antagonist firmly and strongly, with the lance held in a direct line, so that the weapon might break unless the champion was overthrown.</p> 
<p>After this fourth encounter, there was a considerable pause; nor did it appear that any one was very desirous of renewing the contest. The spectators murmured among themselves; for, among the challengers, Malvoisin and Front-de-Boeuf were unpopular from their characters, and the others, except Grantmesnil, were disliked as strangers and foreigners.</p> 
<p>But none shared the general feeling of dissatisfaction so keenly as Cedric the Saxon, who saw, in each advantage gained by the Norman challengers, a repeated triumph over the honour of England. His own education had taught him no skill in the games of chivalry, although, with the arms of his Saxon ancestors, he had manifested himself, on many occasions, a brave and determined soldier. He looked anxiously to Athelstane, who had learned the accomplishments of the age, as if desiring that he should make some personal effort to recover the victory which was passing into the hands of the Templar and his associates. But, though both stout of heart, and strong of person, Athelstane had a disposition too inert and unambitious to make the exertions which Cedric seemed to expect from him.</p> 
<p>"The day is against England, my lord," said Cedric, in a marked tone; "are you not tempted to take the lance?"</p> 
<p>"I shall tilt to-morrow" answered Athelstane, "in the 'melee'; it is not worth while for me to arm myself to-day."</p> 
<p>Two things displeased Cedric in this speech. It contained the Norman word "melee", (to express the general conflict,) and it evinced some indifference to the honour of the country; but it was spoken by Athelstane, whom he held in such profound respect, that he would not trust himself to canvass his motives or his foibles. Moreover, he had no time to make any remark, for Wamba thrust in his word, observing, "It was better, though scarce easier, to be the best man among a hundred, than the best man of two."</p> 
<p>Athelstane took the observation as a serious compliment; but Cedric, who better understood the Jester's meaning, darted at him a severe and menacing look; and lucky it was for Wamba, perhaps, that the time and place prevented his receiving, notwithstanding his place and service, more sensible marks of his master's resentment.</p> 
<p>The pause in the tournament was still uninterrupted, excepting by the voices of the heralds exclaiming---"Love of ladies, splintering of lances! stand forth gallant knights, fair eyes look upon your deeds!"</p> 
<p>The music also of the challengers breathed from time to time wild bursts expressive of triumph or defiance, while the clowns grudged a holiday which seemed to pass away in inactivity; and old knights and nobles lamented in whispers the decay of martial spirit, spoke of the triumphs of their younger days, but agreed that the land did not now supply dames of such transcendent beauty as had animated the jousts of former times. Prince John began to talk to his attendants about making ready the banquet, and the necessity of adjudging the prize to Brian de Bois-Guilbert, who had, with a single spear, overthrown two knights, and foiled a third.</p> 
<p>At length, as the Saracenic music of the challengers concluded one of those long and high flourishes with which they had broken the silence of the lists, it was answered by a solitary trumpet, which breathed a note of defiance from the northern extremity. All eyes were turned to see the new champion which these sounds announced, and no sooner were the barriers opened than he paced into the lists. As far as could be judged of a man sheathed in armour, the new adventurer did not greatly exceed the middle size, and seemed to be rather slender than strongly made. His suit of armour was formed of steel, richly inlaid with gold, and the device on his shield was a young oak-tree pulled up by the roots, with the Spanish word Desdichado, signifying Disinherited. He was mounted on a gallant black horse, and as he passed through the lists he gracefully saluted the Prince and the ladies by lowering his lance. The dexterity with which he managed his steed, and something of youthful grace which he displayed in his manner, won him the favour of the multitude, which some of the lower classes expressed by calling out, "Touch Ralph de Vipont's shield---touch the Hospitallers shield; he has the least sure seat, he is your cheapest bargain."</p> 
<p>The champion, moving onward amid these well-meant hints, ascended the platform by the sloping alley which led to it from the lists, and, to the astonishment of all present, riding straight up to the central pavilion, struck with the sharp end of his spear the shield of Brian de Bois-Guilbert until it rung again. All stood astonished at his presumption, but none more than the redoubted Knight whom he had thus defied to mortal combat, and who, little expecting so rude a challenge, was standing carelessly at the door of the pavilion.</p> 
<p>"Have you confessed yourself, brother," said the Templar, "and have you heard mass this morning, that you peril your life so frankly?"</p> 
<p>"I am fitter to meet death than thou art" answered the Disinherited Knight; for by this name the stranger had recorded himself in the books of the tourney.</p> 
<p>"Then take your place in the lists," said Bois-Guilbert, "and look your last upon the sun; for this night thou shalt sleep in paradise."</p> 
<p>"Gramercy for thy courtesy," replied the Disinherited Knight, "and to requite it, I advise thee to take a fresh horse and a new lance, for by my honour you will need both."</p> 
<p>Having expressed himself thus confidently, he reined his horse backward down the slope which he had ascended, and compelled him in the same manner to move backward through the lists, till he reached the northern extremity, where he remained stationary, in expectation of his antagonist. This feat of horsemanship again attracted the applause of the multitude.</p> 
<p>However incensed at his adversary for the precautions which he recommended, Brian de Bois-Guilbert did not neglect his advice; for his honour was too nearly concerned, to permit his neglecting any means which might ensure victory over his presumptuous opponent. He changed his horse for a proved and fresh one of great strength and spirit. He chose a new and a tough spear, lest the wood of the former might have been strained in the previous encounters he had sustained. Lastly, he laid aside his shield, which had received some little damage, and received another from his squires. His first had only borne the general device of his rider, representing two knights riding upon one horse, an emblem expressive of the original humility and poverty of the Templars, qualities which they had since exchanged for the arrogance and wealth that finally occasioned their suppression. Bois-Guilbert's new shield bore a raven in full flight, holding in its claws a skull, and bearing the motto, "Gare le Corbeau".</p> 
<p>When the two champions stood opposed to each other at the two extremities of the lists, the public expectation was strained to the highest pitch. Few augured the possibility that the encounter could terminate well for the Disinherited Knight, yet his courage and gallantry secured the general good wishes of the spectators.</p> 
<p>The trumpets had no sooner given the signal, than the champions vanished from their posts with the speed of lightning, and closed in the centre of the lists with the shock of a thunderbolt. The lances burst into shivers up to the very grasp, and it seemed at the moment that both knights had fallen, for the shock had made each horse recoil backwards upon its haunches. The address of the riders recovered their steeds by use of the bridle and spur; and having glared on each other for an instant with eyes which seemed to flash fire through the bars of their visors, each made a demi-volte, and, retiring to the extremity of the lists, received a fresh lance from the attendants.</p> 
<p>A loud shout from the spectators, waving of scarfs and handkerchiefs, and general acclamations, attested the interest taken by the spectators in this encounter; the most equal, as well as the best performed, which had graced the day. But no sooner had the knights resumed their station, than the clamour of applause was hushed into a silence, so deep and so dead, that it seemed the multitude were afraid even to breathe.</p> 
<p>A few minutes pause having been allowed, that the combatants and their horses might recover breath, Prince John with his truncheon signed to the trumpets to sound the onset. The champions a second time sprung from their stations, and closed in the centre of the lists, with the same speed, the same dexterity, the same violence, but not the same equal fortune as before.</p> 
<p>In this second encounter, the Templar aimed at the centre of his antagonist's shield, and struck it so fair and forcibly, that his spear went to shivers, and the Disinherited Knight reeled in his saddle. On the other hand, that champion had, in the beginning of his career, directed the point of his lance towards Bois-Guilbert's shield, but, changing his aim almost in the moment of encounter, he addressed it to the helmet, a mark more difficult to hit, but which, if attained, rendered the shock more irresistible. Fair and true he hit the Norman on the visor, where his lance's point kept hold of the bars. Yet, even at this disadvantage, the Templar sustained his high reputation; and had not the girths of his saddle burst, he might not have been unhorsed. As it chanced, however, saddle, horse, and man, rolled on the ground under a cloud of dust.</p> 
<p>To extricate himself from the stirrups and fallen steed, was to the Templar scarce the work of a moment; and, stung with madness, both at his disgrace and at the acclamations with which it was hailed by the spectators, he drew his sword and waved it in defiance of his conqueror. The Disinherited Knight sprung from his steed, and also unsheathed his sword. The marshals of the field, however, spurred their horses between them, and reminded them, that the laws of the tournament did not, on the present occasion, permit this species of encounter.</p> 
<p>"We shall meet again, I trust," said the Templar, casting a resentful glance at his antagonist; "and where there are none to separate us."</p> 
<p>"If we do not," said the Disinherited Knight, "the fault shall not be mine. On foot or horseback, with spear, with axe, or with sword, I am alike ready to encounter thee."</p> 
<p>More and angrier words would have been exchanged, but the marshals, crossing their lances betwixt them, compelled them to separate. The Disinherited Knight returned to his first station, and Bois-Guilbert to his tent, where he remained for the rest of the day in an agony of despair.</p> 
<p>Without alighting from his horse, the conqueror called for a bowl of wine, and opening the beaver, or lower part of his helmet, announced that he quaffed it, "To all true English hearts, and to the confusion of foreign tyrants." He then commanded his trumpet to sound a defiance to the challengers, and desired a herald to announce to them, that he should make no election, but was willing to encounter them in the order in which they pleased to advance against him.</p> 
<p>The gigantic Front-de-Boeuf, armed in sable armour, was the first who took the field. He bore on a white shield a black bull's head, half defaced by the numerous encounters which he had undergone, and bearing the arrogant motto, "Cave, Adsum". Over this champion the Disinherited Knight obtained a slight but decisive advantage. Both Knights broke their lances fairly, but Front-de-Boeuf, who lost a stirrup in the encounter, was adjudged to have the disadvantage.</p> 
<p>In the stranger's third encounter with Sir Philip Malvoisin, he was equally successful; striking that baron so forcibly on the casque, that the laces of the helmet broke, and Malvoisin, only saved from falling by being unhelmeted, was declared vanquished like his companions.</p> 
<p>In his fourth combat with De Grantmesnil, the Disinherited Knight showed as much courtesy as he had hitherto evinced courage and dexterity. De Grantmesnil's horse, which was young and violent, reared and plunged in the course of the career so as to disturb the rider's aim, and the stranger, declining to take the advantage which this accident afforded him, raised his lance, and passing his antagonist without touching him, wheeled his horse and rode back again to his own end of the lists, offering his antagonist, by a herald, the chance of a second encounter. This De Grantmesnil declined, avowing himself vanquished as much by the courtesy as by the address of his opponent.</p> 
<p>Ralph de Vipont summed up the list of the stranger's triumphs, being hurled to the ground with such force, that the blood gushed from his nose and his mouth, and he was borne senseless from the lists.</p> 
<p>The acclamations of thousands applauded the unanimous award of the Prince and marshals, announcing that day's honours to the Disinherited Knight.</p>

<p>《派拉蒙和阿赛特》</p> 
<p>约翰亲王在前呼后拥中突然站住，回头对茹尔沃修道院的长老宣称，这天还有一件大事，他忘记办了。</p> 
<p>“我的老天爷，”他说，“长老，我们忘记指定‘爱与美的女王’了，可是颁奖是要通过她漂亮的手进行的。从我说来，我的观念是很开明的，我认为把这殊荣给予那个黑眼睛的丽贝卡，也未尝不可。”</p> 
<p>“圣母马利亚啊，”长老回答，吃惊得翻起了眼珠，“一个犹太女子！看来我们该给石块打出比武场了，可是我还不太老，不想在这儿殉难呢。再说，我凭我的保护神起誓，她远远比不上可爱的撒克逊美女罗文娜。”</p> 
<p>“撒克逊人或犹太人，”亲王答道。“撒克逊人或犹太人，狗或猪，对我说来都一样！我觉得，即使为了气气那些撒克逊乡巴佬，也应该指定丽贝卡。”</p> 
<p>甚至在他的贴身随从中也响起了一片嘟哝声。</p> 
<p>“这玩笑开得太大了，亲王，”德布拉西开口道，“在这样的侮辱面前，没有一个骑士会端起长枪的。”</p> 
<p>“这对骑士们是奇耻大辱，”约翰亲王身边一个最年长、最重要的随员沃尔德马·菲泽酉说，“如果殿下果真这么做，只能使您的计划中途夭折。”</p> 
<p>“我是请你来当随从，不是来当参谋的，”约翰说，傲慢地勒紧了马组绳。</p> 
<p>“那些追随殿下的人，”沃尔德马说，但压低了嗓音，“既然与您走上了一条道路，他们就有权提出自己的看法，因为他们也像您一样，把自己的利益和安全都押在这上面了。”</p> 
<p>这话的口气使约翰明白，他必须承认这点。“我只是开开玩笑而已，”他说道，“你们却像一条条蝗蛇要围攻我！好吧，随你们爱选谁就选谁，我不管。”</p> 
<p>“不，不，”德布拉西说，“还是让女王的位置暂且空着，等确定了胜利者，由他来选择应该登上这宝座的小姐。这给他的胜利增添了又一道光彩，它让美人们懂得，勇士可以使她们获得如此大的荣誉，因而更珍惜他们的爱情。”</p> 
<p>“如果布里思·布瓦吉贝尔获得胜利，”长老说，“我可以保证，他选出的爱与美的女王一定就是我说的那个人。”</p> 
<p>“布瓦吉贝尔是一个出色的骑士，”德布拉西说，“但是场子里还有不少武士，院长阁下，他们都是敢于与他一决雌雄的。”</p> 
<p>“安静，各位，”沃尔德马说道，“让亲王升座吧。骑士0］和观众都等得不耐烦了，时间已经不早，比赛应该开始了。”</p> 
<p>约翰亲王虽然还没当上国王，沃尔德马·菲泽西却已经负起了一位亲信大臣的责任，时时不忘向他的君主直言劝谏，提出自己的看法。亲王采纳了他的意见，尽管按照他的脾气，他是喜欢在枝节问题上固执己见的；于是他坐上了宝座，在随从人员的护卫下，向典礼官作了个手势，让他们宣布比武大会的规则，它们大致如下：</p> 
<p>第一，五位挑战者不得拒绝应战者的比武要求。</p> 
<p>第二，任何要求比武的骑士，都可以从挑战者中选择他的对手，只须用长枪轻击一下该人的盾牌。他这么做时如果用的是枪柄，那就表示他要求的是所谓友谊比赛，即枪尖上装有一块国头木板，因此交锋时没有危险，至多人和马受些震动。但如果用枪尖轻击盾牌，那么比武就得“真干”，也就是用锐利的武器厮打，像真正作战一样。</p> 
<p>第三，当出场的骑士完成各自的誓约，每人打败五名对手以后，亲王便可宣布第一天比武的胜利者，他获得的奖品是一匹十分漂亮、无比强壮的战马；除此以外，他的勇敢还可获得一项殊荣，那就是指定爱和美的女E，第二天这位女工便将负责颁发奖品。</p> 
<p>第四，根据规定，第二天将举行团体比武，所有在场的骑士，凡是想争夺荣誉的都可以参加。全体参加者将分成两队，人数相等，双方可各尽所能，英勇拼杀，直到约翰亲王发出号令，宣布比赛结束为止。第二天表现最出色的骑士，经亲王裁定后，即由爱和美的女王为他加冕，戴上用薄金叶制作的、雕成桂冠形的头饰。这样，骑士比赛在第二天便结束了。但下一天还要举行群众性的射箭比赛、斗牛和其他娱乐活动，让大家从直接参与中获得更大乐趣。原来约翰亲王企图通过这方式，为他的笼络人心打下基础，因为他平日荒淫无耻，轻举妄动，伤害了人民的感情，造成了不良的影响。</p> 
<p>这时比武场上真是五彩缤纷，热闹异常。斜坡的看台上人头攒动，英国北部和中部的贵族、官僚、阔老和美女，几乎全都汇集到了这儿；这些尊贵的观众穿着形形色色、鲜艳夺目的衣服，构成了一幅欢乐轻快、奢华繁荣的景象；场内平地上则挤满了殷实的市民和快活的自由民，他们的衣着比较朴实，在那个富丽堂皇的圆圈周围，形成了一条暗淡的边缘地带，既对它起了调和作用，也把它衬托得更加光辉灿烂了。</p> 
<p>典礼官宣布比武规则后，照例要拉开嗓门大喊：“赏钱，赏钱，勇敢的骑士们！”于是大把大把的金银钱币从看台上扔了下来。原来当时的风气认为，典礼官是荣誉的保护者和记录者，对他们的慷慨赠予是骑士精神的豪迈表现。他们也照例会用响亮的呼喊答谢观众的好意：“美人献出爱情，武士视死如归，慷慨解囊得到赞美，英勇无畏人人钦佩！”普通的观众随即大声喝彩，一大队号手也吹响了雄壮的曲子。等这些声音平息以后，典礼官们便在兴高采烈中纷纷退场，只剩下两个警卫督察留在场子两头，他们全副武装，骑在马上一动不动，像两尊塑像。这时场子北端那块围场虽然宽广，已挤满了自告奋勇要与挑战者对阵的骑士，从看台上望去，那里成了一片翎毛的海洋，其中夹杂着闪光的头盔和高举的长枪，枪尖上大多挂着一作宽的小燕尾旗，微风吹过，旗子便在空中翻滚飞扬，与不断拂动的羽翎组合在一起，把整个场面点缀得更加生气勃勃。</p> 
<p>最后，栅栏门打开了，靠抽签决定的五名骑上缓缓进入了广场，一个武士骑在前面，另外四个分为两对跟在后面。他们全都穿着光辉夺目的盔甲，我的撒克逊权威（在《沃杜尔文稿》(注1)中）曾连篇累牍记录过它们的式样、颜色，以至马饰的绣花等等，对这一切，这里就无需详加说明了。我只想引用当代一位诗人的几行诗，他写得十分简单：</p> 
<p>骑士业已化作尘埃，</p> 
<p>宝剑业已锈成废铁，</p> 
<p>但愿他们的灵魂仍与圣徒在一起。(注2)</p> 
<p>--------</p>

<p>(注2)这是柯勒律治未发表的一首诗中的几行，他的诗神抛出的往往是一些令人逻想联翩的片断，这反映了他完全凭一时兴趣写作的写诗态度，然而这些未完成的片断有时比别人精心制作的巨著更能发人深省。——原注</p>

<p>在这些骑士的城堡中，他们的盾形纹章早已在墙上腐烂。城堡本身也成了野草丛生的废墟，本来熟悉他们的地方已把他们视同陌路——是的，在这片土地上他们曾享有过封建领主和贵族的全部特权，可是自从那时以来，许多家族已在这里相继消失，被人遗忘了，那么读者又何必一定要知道他们的姓名，或者代表他们的军人身分的那些转瞬即逝的标志呢？</p> 
<p>不过现在，这五位勇士还不会想到，他们的名声和功绩必将湮没无闻的命运，他们骑在马上穿过场子，一边勒紧缰绳，迫使骠悍的战马缓步慢行，以便展示它们的雄健步伐，表现骑马者的优美姿态和风度。这队人一进入比武场，挑战者的帐篷后面立即响起了震耳欲聋的粗野乐声，演奏的人都隐藏在那里。这支东方风格的乐队是从圣地带回来的，饶钹声和钟声的混合，对缓缓走近的骑士，似乎既是表示欢迎，也是表示蔑视。全场的观众都把目光集中到了那五个骑士身上，只见他们朝着挑战者的帐篷所在的平台走去，到了那里随即分开，各自用枪柄的末端轻轻击打了一下他所选择的对手的盾牌。下层的所有观众——不，看台上的人也大多这样，据说其中还有不少妇女——都对这些武士选择友好的比武方式，感到有些失望。因为正如今天的人热衷于残忍的凶杀戏剧一样，那时的人看比武，也是厮杀的场面越危险，越能博得他们的欢心。</p> 
<p>那些武士宣布了比较和平的意图之后，便退回比武场的一端，排成一行站在那里；这时挑战者纷纷走出各自的帐篷，跨上马背，以布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔为首，从平台上下来，分别与自己的对手遥遥相对，站在场子的另一端。</p> 
<p>随着号角与喇叭的一声长鸣，双方便以最快的速度迎面疾驰；挑战者们由于武艺高强，或者由于运气好，占了上风，布瓦吉贝尔、马尔沃卡和牛面将军的对方，转眼之间一个个摔到了地上。格兰梅斯尼尔的对手却未能把枪尖对准敌人的帽盔或盾牌，以致它歪到一边，从对方的身上擦过——这个失着对骑士而言是比翻身落马更不光彩的，因为后者可能出于一时的疏忽，而前者却是武艺不高，不能得心应手地使用武器和驾驭战马的表现。只有第五个人在他那一伙中还差强人意，与他的对手圣约翰骑士打了个平手，彼此打断了对方的长枪。</p> 
<p>群众的喝彩声、典礼官的欢呼声和号角声响成一片，宣告了一场比武的结束。胜利者退回了自己的帐篷，失败者则尽可能振作精神，带着耻辱们失望退出场子，与胜利者就赎回他们的武器和坐骑进行磋商，因为按照比武的规则，这些东西应归胜利者所有。他们中只有那第五个人还在场子里逗留了一下，以便接受附近几个观众的欢呼，这毫无疑问，只能使他的同伴更加觉得无地自容。</p> 
<p>第二批和第三批骑士相继来到场内，他们虽然取得了一些胜利，但整个说来，优势仍在挑战者一边，他们没有一个落下马背或刺不中目标，他们的对方却在交锋中总有一两个人遭到这类不幸。这样，与挑战者对立的一边，由于不断失利，显然精神相当消沉。在第四次较量中，只有三个骑士出场，他们避开了布瓦吉贝尔和牛面将军的盾牌，只挑选了其他三个武艺不如他们精湛、力气不如他们大的骑士。但这一谨慎的选择没有改变场上的形势，挑战者依然取得了胜利。他们的对手中，一个给打下马背，另两人则在冲刺中失利。那就是说在向对方的头盔和盾牌冲击时，用力过猛过大，又把长枪举成一直线，以致不是武器折断，便是武士给抛下马背。</p> 
<p>第四次比赛以后，场上沉寂了好久，看来没有人再想展开新的较量了。观众在交头接耳，窃窃私语；原来挑战者中间，马尔沃辛和牛面将军由于专横暴虐，一向不得人心；除了格兰梅斯尼尔，其他两人也不受欢迎，因为他们都是异族人和外国人。</p> 
<p>这种不满情绪是普遍的，但是谁也不如撒克逊人塞德里克那么强烈，他觉得诺曼挑战者的每一次胜利，都是对英国的荣誉的一次打击。他接受的教育没有骑士比武的内容，尽管他曾带着他祖先的纹章，以一个勇敢而坚定的战士的面目出现在许多场合。他焦急地望着阿特尔斯坦，后者是受过这项训练的，仿佛在要求他亲自出马，从圣殿骑士这伙人手中，夺回被他们抢走的胜利果实。阿特尔斯坦虽然不怕牺牲，而且身体强壮，但天性好逸恶劳，胸无大志，不想把塞德里克的希望付诸实施。</p> 
<p>“我的爵爷，英国今天已脸面扫地，”塞德里克用郑重的口气说，“难道你还不打算拿起武器来吗？”</p> 
<p>“我预备明天上场，”阿特尔斯坦回答，“参加明天的melee；今天也披挂上阵未免多此一举。”</p> 
<p>这句话中有两点叫塞德里克听了觉得不顺耳。它包含了一个诺曼字melee（它的意思是团体战斗），又在一定程度上流露了不关心祖国荣誉的态度。但这话又出自阿特尔斯坦之口，他一向对他十分尊敬，不想追究他的动机或弱点。再说，他也没有时间提出批评，因为汪八这时插了进来，说道：“在一百个人中捞个第一，比在两个人中争高低更有意思，尽管这也并不容易。”</p> 
<p>阿特尔斯坦把这话当作了真心称赞；但是塞德里克更懂得小丑的心思，用严厉而威胁的目光瞪了他一眼；也许多亏时间和地点不允许，他才没有在一怒之下，不顾汪八的身分和职务，把他大骂一顿。</p> 
<p>比武依然停顿着，没人上场，只有典礼官在大声喊叫：“美人献出爱情，长枪纷纷折断！站出来吧，勇敢的骑士们，美丽的眼睛在等待着伟大的行动！”</p> 
<p>挑战者的乐队不时迸发出狂热的曲调，表现了胜利和蔑视的情绪；乡下佬在叨咕，埋怨一个大好节日眼看就要葬送在无声的等待中了；年老的骑士和贵族则在喋喋不休，为尚武精神的衰退发出叹息，谈论他们年轻时代的壮举，但一致同意，今天这个国家已不能提供绝代佳人，那种曾鼓舞从前的骑士赴汤蹈火的美女。约翰亲王开始与随从们商量晚宴的事，他认为，布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔摘取桂冠已成定局，他凭手中一支枪接连把两个骑士打下了马，又打败了第三个人。</p> 
<p>最后，挑战者方面那支萨拉森乐队为了打破比武场上的沉静局面，再一次奏起了漫长而高昂的曲调，但是正当它快结束时，一声孤单的号音蓦地凌空而起，这是应战的调子，来自场子的北端。所有的眼睛都转向了作出这宣布的那位新武士，栅栏门随即大开，他进入了比武场。从包在盔甲内的体形看来，这位新的冒险者的身材不过中等略高，与其说强壮，不如说瘦小。他那身销甲系纯钢制成，镶了不少金饰，盾牌上的纹章是一棵连根拔起的小栎树，下面题了个西班牙字：Desdichado，它的意思是“剥夺了继承权的”。他骑一匹骠悍的黑马，穿过场子时从容不迫，把长枪放低一些，向亲王和女士们表示敬意。他骑马的姿势显得英俊潇洒，带有年轻人风度翩翩的仪表，这使他立即赢得了群众的好感，以致下层阶级的一些人不禁向他大喊：“选择拉尔夫·维庞特作对手，选择医护骑士作对手，他在马上摇摇晃晃的，这是一笔最便宜的买卖。”</p> 
<p>武士对这些善意的提示没有理会，来到场子南面，沿着那条斜坡，走上了平台；令全场观众大吃一惊的是，他径直向中央的帐篷骑去，用长枪的尖端对着布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔的盾牌重重一击，使它发出了响亮的回声。这个大胆的行动引起了普遍的惊异，但最吃惊的还是那位可怕的骑士本人，当时他正逍遥自在地站在帐篷门口，看到这人居然无视他的威名，要与他决一死战，而且态度如此狂妄，这确实出乎他的意料。</p> 
<p>“老弟，你这么满不在乎的拿生命作儿戏，今天早上作过临终忏悔没有，做过祷告没有？”圣殿骑士开口道。</p> 
<p>“我不像你那么怕死，”剥夺了继承权的骑士回答——他在比武的名册上登记的便是这个名字。</p> 
<p>“那么到比武场上去等着吧，”布瓦吉贝尔说，“好好瞧瞧太阳，这已是你最后一次，因为今天夜里你就得睡在极乐园中了。”</p> 
<p>“多谢你的关照，”剥夺了继承权的骑士回答，“作为回报，我劝你换一匹马，也换一支枪，我保证，这是你必须做的两件事。”</p> 
<p>他这么满怀信心地讲完之后，便拉紧缰绳，让马循原路退下斜坡，又以同样倒退的方式穿过场子，直至抵达北端，才一动不动地停在那儿，等待对方的出场。这一番骑术表演，再一次赢得了观众的喝彩。</p> 
<p>尽管遭到了对方的奚落，布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔十分恼火，但没有对他提出的警告置之不理周为这次比武对他的荣誉关系太密切了，不允许他疏忽大意，他必须做到万无一失，打败那个自命不凡的对手。他换了一匹马，那是一匹久经考验的精力充沛、身强力壮的马；又挑选了一支坚韧有力的长枪，怕原来那支枪在前几次交锋中已受到损伤。最后，他丢下了盾牌，它已经有些打坏了，又从他的扈从那里换了一个。原来那个盾牌上画的，只是两个骑士骑在一匹马上，这是象征圣殿骑士早先的谦卑和清贫的，(注)但后来他们的地位变了，他们也变得骄横和富裕了，这最终导致了他们的被取缔。布瓦吉贝尔的新盾牌上画的是一只展翅飞翔的渡鸦，它的爪上吊着一个骷髅，上面的题词是：“所向披靡”。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)圣殿骑士团成立时（1119年）只有八、九个人，他们十分贫穷，因此用两个人骑一匹马作他们的标记。后来他们在战争中发了财，变得骄横跋扈，到了1302年圣殿骑士团终于被教皇下令取缔。</p> 
<p>两位骑士在比武场两端相向站立时，群众的兴趣达到了顶点。没有几个人相信，剥夺继承权的骑士能在这场比赛中赢得胜利；然而他的勇气和豪情得到了观众的好感，大家在心里希望他能如愿以偿。</p> 
<p>号声刚才发出，两人已以闪电的速度向前飞驰，带着雷霆万钧之势在场子中央相遇。两支长枪除了握手的地方，碎成了几段，这时仿佛两个骑士都倒下了，因为冲击的力量那么大，使各人的马都倒退几步，直立了起来。但他们凭熟练的技术，依靠缰绳和踢马刺的作用，控制住了马；两人彼此瞪了一眼，眼睛仿佛从面甲的铁栅后面在射出火星；然后他们收紧缰绳，让马转了半圈，退回场子两端，向随从手中另拿了一支长枪。</p> 
<p>场子里欢声雷动，围巾和手帕在头顶挥动，喝彩声此起彼伏，接连不断，证明了观众对这场比赛的浓厚兴趣——双方势均力敌，旗鼓相当，成了这一天最光辉的一幕。但两位骑士回到原来的出发地点后，欢呼声便沉寂了，场内变得鸦雀无声，仿佛群众在屏声静气等待另一回合比赛的开始。</p> 
<p>几分钟的停顿是允许的，可以让比武者和马略事休息；接着，约翰亲王举起权杖，示意号手发出开始的信号。两位骑士又一次从原地出发，在场子中央遭遇，与上一次速度相同，行动的敏捷和猛烈也相同，只是命运却不同了。</p> 
<p>在第二次冲击中，圣殿骑士瞄准的是对方盾牌的中心，他刺得这么准，这么有力，以致在遭遇时他的长枪碎成了几段，甚至使剥夺继承权的骑士也在马上晃了一下。至于他的对手，在冲击开始时，他虽然也把枪尖对准着布瓦吉贝尔的盾牌，但在即将遭遇的一霎那，他却改变目标，把枪对准了帽盔，这个目标不容易击中，但一旦成功，它引起的震动可以说是无法抵挡的。他的枪不偏不倚，正好击中了诺曼人的面甲，卡在它的铁栅中。然而哪怕遇到这种不利局面，圣殿骑士本来仍可保持他良好的声誉，只可惜这时他的马鞍带断裂了，以致他在马上再也坐不住。这么一来，马鞍、马和人全都落到了地上，掀起了一股尘土。</p> 
<p>为了使自己脱离脚镫和倒下的马，圣殿骑士着实花了一番功夫；这丢脸的一幕和观众的喝彩声把他气得发疯一般，立刻拔出了剑，挥舞着奔向他的战胜者。剥夺继承权的骑士跳下马背，也拔出了剑。然而场上的警卫督察已骑着马，赶到两人中间，提醒他们，比武的规则不允许他们在这样的场合，使用这样的武器进行厮杀。</p> 
<p>“我相信，我们还会碰头的，”圣殿骑士说，狠狠地瞥了对方一眼，“到那时就没人可以分开我们了。”</p> 
<p>“好吧，如果不碰面，责任不会在我一边，”剥夺继承权的骑士说。“到时候，是步战还是马战，是用长枪、战斧、还是剑，都可以悉听尊便。”</p> 
<p>他们还想说几句更激烈的话，但两位警卫督察已把长枪交叉着拦在他们中间，迫使他们分开了。剥夺继承权的骑士回到了原来的位置，布瓦吉贝尔钻进他的帐篷，在失望和痛苦中度过了这一天，没有再露面。</p> 
<p>胜利者这时没有下马，要了一大碗酒，揭开脸罩或头盔的下部，宣称他用这碗酒“向英国每一颗正直的良心致敬，向外国的暴君预告他们的覆灭。”然后他命令他的号手吹响了向挑战者挑战的号音，要求典礼官向他们宣布，他不想选择，但愿意迎战他们中的每一个人，先后次序由他们自行决定。</p> 
<p>彪形大汉牛面将军身穿黑盔黑甲，第一个冲进场内。他的白盾牌上画的大黑牛头，经过几次交锋已只剩下一半，盾牌上大言不惭地写着“常胜将军”几个字。对这位武士，剥夺继承权的骑士占据了有限但决定性的上风。两人都打得勇猛，只是牛面将军在交战中掉了一只脚镫，因而被裁定为较差一筹。</p> 
<p>陌生人的第三次交锋是与菲利普·马尔沃李进行的，他同样取得了胜利；他的枪十分有力，击中了男爵的头盔，以致系头盔的带子断了，马尔沃辛只因丢了头盔，才没掉下马背；这样，他与他的同伴们一样被宣布为失败者。</p> 
<p>在与第四个对手格兰梅斯尼尔较量时，剥夺继承权的骑士不仅像前几次一样勇猛和机灵，而且显得十分客气。格兰梅斯尼尔的马还年幼，性子急躁，冲击时忽快忽慢，打乱了骑手的目标，可是陌生人却不想利用这意外的机会，抬起了枪，让它从对方头顶擦过，没碰到他；然后他旋转马头，骑回原地，通过典礼官知会他，允许他作第二次冲击。格兰梅斯尼尔谢绝了，宣称自己已经失败，表现了与对方同样谦让的态度。</p> 
<p>拉尔夫·维庞特又给陌生人增添了一次胜利的记录；他给抛下马背，重重地掉在地上，以致口鼻鲜血直流，是在昏迷中给抬下比武场的。</p> 
<p>在群众排山倒海般的欢呼声中，约翰亲王和警卫督察一致宣布，剥夺继承权的骑士取得了这一天的光辉胜利。</p>
