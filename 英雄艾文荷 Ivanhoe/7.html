<p>Oswald, returning, whispered into the ear of his master, "It is a Jew, who calls himself Isaac of York; is it fit I should marshall him into the hall?"</p> 
<p>"Let Gurth do thine office, Oswald," said Wamba with his usual effrontery; "the swineherd will be a fit usher to the Jew."</p> 
<p>"St Mary," said the Abbot, crossing himself, "an unbelieving Jew, and admitted into this presence!"</p> 
<p>"A dog Jew," echoed the Templar, "to approach a defender of the Holy Sepulchre?"</p> 
<p>"By my faith," said Wamba, "it would seem the Templars love the Jews' inheritance better than they do their company."</p> 
<p>"Peace, my worthy guests," said Cedric; "my hospitality must not be bounded by your dislikes. If Heaven bore with the whole nation of stiff-necked unbelievers for more years than a layman can number, we may endure the presence of one Jew for a few hours. But I constrain no man to converse or to feed with him. ---Let him have a board and a morsel apart,---unless," he said smiling, "these turban'd strangers will admit his society."</p> 
<p>"Sir Franklin," answered the Templar, "my Saracen slaves are true Moslems, and scorn as much as any Christian to hold intercourse with a Jew."</p> 
<p>"Now, in faith," said Wamba, "I cannot see that the worshippers of Mahound and Termagaunt have so greatly the advantage over the people once chosen of Heaven."</p> 
<p>"He shall sit with thee, Wamba," said Cedric; "the fool and the knave will be well met."</p> 
<p>"The fool," answered Wamba, raising the relics of a gammon of bacon, "will take care to erect a bulwark against the knave."</p> 
<p>"Hush," said Cedric, "for here he comes."</p> 
<p>Introduced with little ceremony, and advancing with fear and hesitation, and many a bow of deep humility, a tall thin old man, who, however, had lost by the habit of stooping much of his actual height, approached the lower end of the board. His features, keen and regular, with an aquiline nose, and piercing black eyes; his high and wrinkled forehead, and long grey hair and beard, would have been considered as handsome, had they not been the marks of a physiognomy peculiar to a race, which, during those dark ages, was alike detested by the credulous and prejudiced vulgar, and persecuted by the greedy and rapacious nobility, and who, perhaps, owing to that very hatred and persecution, had adopted a national character, in which there was much, to say the least, mean and unamiable.</p> 
<p>The Jew's dress, which appeared to have suffered considerably from the storm, was a plain russet cloak of many folds, covering a dark purple tunic. He had large boots lined with fur, and a belt around his waist, which sustained a small knife, together with a case for writing materials, but no weapon. He wore a high square yellow cap of a peculiar fashion, assigned to his nation to distinguish them from Christians, and which he doffed with great humility at the door of the hall.</p> 
<p>The reception of this person in the hall of Cedric the Saxon, was such as might have satisfied the most prejudiced enemy of the tribes of Israel. Cedric himself coldly nodded in answer to the Jew's repeated salutations, and signed to him to take place at the lower end of the table, where, however, no one offered to make room for him. On the contrary, as he passed along the file, casting a timid supplicating glance, and turning towards each of those who occupied the lower end of the board, the Saxon domestics squared their shoulders, and continued to devour their supper with great perseverance, paying not the least attention to the wants of the new guest. The attendants of the Abbot crossed themselves, with looks of pious horror, and the very heathen Saracens, as Isaac drew near them, curled up their whiskers with indignation, and laid their hands on their poniards, as if ready to rid themselves by the most desperate means from the apprehended contamination of his nearer approach.</p> 
<p>Probably the same motives which induced Cedric to open his hall to this son of a rejected people, would have made him insist on his attendants receiving Isaac with more courtesy. But the Abbot had, at this moment, engaged him in a most interesting discussion on the breed and character of his favourite hounds, which he would not have interrupted for matters of much greater importance than that of a Jew going to bed supperless. While Isaac thus stood an outcast in the present society, like his people among the nations, looking in vain for welcome or resting place, the pilgrim who sat by the chimney took compassion upon him, and resigned his seat, saying briefly, "Old man, my garments are dried, my hunger is appeased, thou art both wet and fasting." So saying, he gathered together, and brought to a flame, the decaying brands which lay scattered on the ample hearth; took from the larger board a mess of pottage and seethed kid, placed it upon the small table at which he had himself supped, and, without waiting the Jew's thanks, went to the other side of the hall;---whether from unwillingness to hold more close communication with the object of his benevolence, or from a wish to draw near to the upper end of the table, seemed uncertain.</p> 
<p>Had there been painters in those days capable to execute such a subject, the Jew, as he bent his withered form, and expanded his chilled and trembling hands over the fire, would have formed no bad emblematical personification of the Winter season. Having dispelled the cold, he turned eagerly to the smoking mess which was placed before him, and ate with a haste and an apparent relish, that seemed to betoken long abstinence from food.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile the Abbot and Cedric continued their discourse upon hunting; the Lady Rowena seemed engaged in conversation with one of her attendant females; and the haughty Templar, whose eye wandered from the Jew to the Saxon beauty, revolved in his mind thoughts which appeared deeply to interest him.</p> 
<p>"I marvel, worthy Cedric," said the Abbot, as their discourse proceeded, "that, great as your predilection is for your own manly language, you do not receive the Norman-French into your favour, so far at least as the mystery of wood-craft and hunting is concerned. Surely no tongue is so rich in the various phrases which the field-sports demand, or furnishes means to the experienced woodman so well to express his jovial art."</p> 
<p>"Good Father Aymer," said the Saxon, "be it known to you, I care not for those over-sea refinements, without which I can well enough take my pleasure in the woods. I can wind my horn, though I call not the blast either a 'recheate' or a 'morte'---I can cheer my dogs on the prey, and I can flay and quarter the animal when it is brought down, without using the newfangled jargon of 'curee, arbor, nombles', and all the babble of the fabulous Sir Tristrem."*</p> 
<p>* There was no language which the Normans more formally * separated from that of common life than the terms of the * chase. The objects of their pursuit, whether bird or * animal, changed their name each year, and there were a * hundred conventional terms, to be ignorant of which was to * be without one of the distinguishing marks of a gentleman. * The reader may consult Dame Juliana Berners' book on the * subject. The origin of this science was imputed to the * celebrated Sir Tristrem, famous for his tragic intrigue * with the beautiful Ysolte. As the Normans reserved the * amusement of hunting strictly to themselves, the terms of * this formal jargon were all taken from the French language.</p> 
<p>"The French," said the Templar, raising his voice with the presumptuous and authoritative tone which he used upon all occasions, "is not only the natural language of the chase, but that of love and of war, in which ladies should be won and enemies defied."</p> 
<p>"Pledge me in a cup of wine, Sir Templar," said Cedric, "and fill another to the Abbot, while I look back some thirty years to tell you another tale. As Cedric the Saxon then was, his plain English tale needed no garnish from French troubadours, when it was told in the ear of beauty; and the field of Northallerton, upon the day of the Holy Standard, could tell whether the Saxon war-cry was not heard as far within the ranks of the Scottish host as the 'cri de guerre' of the boldest Norman baron. To the memory of the brave who fought there!---Pledge me, my guests." He drank deep, and went on with increasing warmth. "Ay, that was a day of cleaving of shields, when a hundred banners were bent forwards over the heads of the valiant, and blood flowed round like water, and death was held better than flight. A Saxon bard had called it a feast of the swords---a gathering of the eagles to the prey---the clashing of bills upon shield and helmet, the shouting of battle more joyful than the clamour of a bridal. But our bards are no more," he said; "our deeds are lost in those of another race---our language---our very name---is hastening to decay, and none mourns for it save one solitary old man ---Cupbearer! knave, fill the goblets---To the strong in arms, Sir Templar, be their race or language what it will, who now bear them best in Palestine among the champions of the Cross!"</p> 
<p>"It becomes not one wearing this badge to answer," said Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert; "yet to whom, besides the sworn Champions of the Holy Sepulchre, can the palm be assigned among the champions of the Cross?"</p> 
<p>"To the Knights Hospitallers," said the Abbot; "I have a brother of their order."</p> 
<p>"I impeach not their fame," said the Templar; "nevertheless-----"</p> 
<p>"I think, friend Cedric," said Wamba, interfering, "that had Richard of the Lion's Heart been wise enough to have taken a fool's advice, he might have staid at home with his merry Englishmen, and left the recovery of Jerusalem to those same Knights who had most to do with the loss of it."</p> 
<p>"Were there, then, none in the English army," said the Lady Rowena, "whose names are worthy to be mentioned with the Knights of the Temple, and of St John?"</p> 
<p>"Forgive me, lady," replied De Bois-Guilbert; "the English monarch did, indeed, bring to Palestine a host of gallant warriors, second only to those whose breasts have been the unceasing bulwark of that blessed land."</p> 
<p>"Second to NONE," said the Pilgrim, who had stood near enough to hear, and had listened to this conversation with marked impatience. All turned toward the spot from whence this unexpected asseveration was heard.</p> 
<p>"I say," repeated the Pilgrim in a firm and strong voice, "that the English chivalry were second to NONE who ever drew sword in defence of the Holy Land. I say besides, for I saw it, that King Richard himself, and five of his knights, held a tournament after the taking of St John-de-Acre, as challengers against all comers. I say that, on that day, each knight ran three courses, and cast to the ground three antagonists. I add, that seven of these assailants were Knights of the Temple---and Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert well knows the truth of what I tell you."</p> 
<p>It is impossible for language to describe the bitter scowl of rage which rendered yet darker the swarthy countenance of the Templar. In the extremity of his resentment and confusion, his quivering fingers griped towards the handle of his sword, and perhaps only withdrew, from the consciousness that no act of violence could be safely executed in that place and presence. Cedric, whose feelings were all of a right onward and simple kind, and were seldom occupied by more than one object at once, omitted, in the joyous glee with which he heard of the glory of his countrymen, to remark the angry confusion of his guest; "I would give thee this golden bracelet, Pilgrim," he said, "couldst thou tell me the names of those knights who upheld so gallantly the renown of merry England."</p> 
<p>"That will I do blithely," replied the Pilgrim, "and without guerdon; my oath, for a time, prohibits me from touching gold."</p> 
<p>"I will wear the bracelet for you, if you will, friend Palmer," said Wamba.</p> 
<p>"The first in honour as in arms, in renown as in place," said the Pilgrim, "was the brave Richard, King of England."</p> 
<p>"I forgive him," said Cedric; "I forgive him his descent from the tyrant Duke William."</p> 
<p>"The Earl of Leicester was the second," continued the Pilgrim; "Sir Thomas Multon of Gilsland was the third."</p> 
<p>"Of Saxon descent, he at least," said Cedric, with exultation.</p> 
<p>"Sir Foulk Doilly the fourth," proceeded the Pilgrim.</p> 
<p>"Saxon also, at least by the mother's side," continued Cedric, who listened with the utmost eagerness, and forgot, in part at least, his hatred to the Normans, in the common triumph of the King of England and his islanders. "And who was the fifth?" he demanded.</p> 
<p>"The fifth was Sir Edwin Turneham."</p> 
<p>"Genuine Saxon, by the soul of Hengist!" shouted Cedric---"And the sixth?" he continued with eagerness---"how name you the sixth?"</p> 
<p>"The sixth," said the Palmer, after a pause, in which he seemed to recollect himself, "was a young knight of lesser renown and lower rank, assumed into that honourable company, less to aid their enterprise than to make up their number---his name dwells not in my memory."</p> 
<p>"Sir Palmer," said Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert scornfully, "this assumed forgetfulness, after so much has been remembered, comes too late to serve your purpose. I will myself tell the name of the knight before whose lance fortune and my horse's fault occasioned my falling---it was the Knight of Ivanhoe; nor was there one of the six that, for his years, had more renown in arms.---Yet this will I say, and loudly---that were he in England, and durst repeat, in this week's tournament, the challenge of St John-de-Acre, I, mounted and armed as I now am, would give him every advantage of weapons, and abide the result."</p> 
<p>"Your challenge would soon be answered," replied the Palmer, "were your antagonist near you. As the matter is, disturb not the peaceful hall with vaunts of the issue of the conflict, which you well know cannot take place. If Ivanhoe ever returns from Palestine, I will be his surety that he meets you."</p> 
<p>"A goodly security!" said the Knight Templar; "and what do you proffer as a pledge?"</p> 
<p>"This reliquary," said the Palmer, taking a small ivory box from his bosom, and crossing himself, "containing a portion of the true cross, brought from the Monastery of Mount Carmel."</p> 
<p>The Prior of Jorvaulx crossed himself and repeated a pater noster, in which all devoutly joined, excepting the Jew, the Mahomedans, and the Templar; the latter of whom, without vailing his bonnet, or testifying any reverence for the alleged sanctity of the relic, took from his neck a gold chain, which he flung on the board, saying---"Let Prior Aymer hold my pledge and that of this nameless vagrant, in token that when the Knight of Ivanhoe comes within the four seas of Britain, he underlies the challenge of Brian de Bois-Guilbert, which, if he answer not, I will proclaim him as a coward on the walls of every Temple Court in Europe."</p> 
<p>"It will not need," said the Lady Rowena, breaking silence; "My voice shall be heard, if no other in this hall is raised in behalf of the absent Ivanhoe. I affirm he will meet fairly every honourable challenge. Could my weak warrant add security to the inestimable pledge of this holy pilgrim, I would pledge name and fame that Ivanhoe gives this proud knight the meeting he desires."</p> 
<p>A crowd of conflicting emotions seemed to have occupied Cedric, and kept him silent during this discussion. Gratified pride, resentment, embarrassment, chased each other over his broad and open brow, like the shadow of clouds drifting over a harvest-field; while his attendants, on whom the name of the sixth knight seemed to produce an effect almost electrical, hung in suspense upon their master's looks. But when Rowena spoke, the sound of her voice seemed to startle him from his silence.</p> 
<p>"Lady," said Cedric, "this beseems not; were further pledge necessary, I myself, offended, and justly offended, as I am, would yet gage my honour for the honour of Ivanhoe. But the wager of battle is complete, even according to the fantastic fashions of Norman chivalry---Is it not, Father Aymer?"</p> 
<p>"It is," replied the Prior; "and the blessed relic and rich chain will I bestow safely in the treasury of our convent, until the decision of this warlike challenge."</p> 
<p>Having thus spoken, he crossed himself again and again, and after many genuflections and muttered prayers, he delivered the reliquary to Brother Ambrose, his attendant monk, while he himself swept up with less ceremony, but perhaps with no less internal satisfaction, the golden chain, and bestowed it in a pouch lined with perfumed leather, which opened under his arm. "And now, Sir Cedric," he said, "my ears are chiming vespers with the strength of your good wine---permit us another pledge to the welfare of the Lady Rowena, and indulge us with liberty to pass to our repose."</p> 
<p>"By the rood of Bromholme," said the Saxon, "you do but small credit to your fame, Sir Prior! Report speaks you a bonny monk, that would hear the matin chime ere he quitted his bowl; and, old as I am, I feared to have shame in encountering you. But, by my faith, a Saxon boy of twelve, in my time, would not so soon have relinquished his goblet."</p> 
<p>The Prior had his own reasons, however, for persevering in the course of temperance which he had adopted. He was not only a professional peacemaker, but from practice a hater of all feuds and brawls. It was not altogether from a love to his neighbour, or to himself, or from a mixture of both. On the present occasion, he had an instinctive apprehension of the fiery temper of the Saxon, and saw the danger that the reckless and presumptuous spirit, of which his companion had already given so many proofs, might at length produce some disagreeable explosion. He therefore gently insinuated the incapacity of the native of any other country to engage in the genial conflict of the bowl with the hardy and strong-headed Saxons; something he mentioned, but slightly, about his own holy character, and ended by pressing his proposal to depart to repose.</p> 
<p>The grace-cup was accordingly served round, and the guests, after making deep obeisance to their landlord and to the Lady Rowena, arose and mingled in the hall, while the heads of the family, by separate doors, retired with their attendants.</p> 
<p>"Unbelieving dog," said the Templar to Isaac the Jew, as he passed him in the throng, "dost thou bend thy course to the tournament?"</p> 
<p>"I do so propose," replied Isaac, bowing in all humility, "if it please your reverend valour."</p> 
<p>"Ay," said the Knight, "to gnaw the bowels of our nobles with usury, and to gull women and boys with gauds and toys---I warrant thee store of shekels in thy Jewish scrip."</p> 
<p>"Not a shekel, not a silver penny, not a halfling---so help me the God of Abraham!" said the Jew, clasping his hands; "I go but to seek the assistance of some brethren of my tribe to aid me to pay the fine which the Exchequer of the Jews have imposed upon me---Father Jacob be my speed! I am an impoverished wretch---the very gaberdine I wear is borrowed from Reuben of Tadcaster."</p> 
<p>* In those days the Jews were subjected to an Exchequer, * specially dedicated to that purpose, and which laid them * under the most exorbitant impositions.---L. T.</p> 
<p>The Templar smiled sourly as he replied, "Beshrew thee for a false-hearted liar!" and passing onward, as if disdaining farther conference, he communed with his Moslem slaves in a language unknown to the bystanders. The poor Israelite seemed so staggered by the address of the military monk, that the Templar had passed on to the extremity of the hall ere he raised his head from the humble posture which he had assumed, so far as to be sensible of his departure. And when he did look around, it was with the astonished air of one at whose feet a thunderbolt has just burst, and who hears still the astounding report ringing in his ears.</p> 
<p>The Templar and Prior were shortly after marshalled to their sleeping apartments by the steward and the cupbearer, each attended by two torchbearers and two servants carrying refreshments, while servants of inferior condition indicated to their retinue and to the other guests their respective places of repose.</p>

<p>奥斯瓦尔德回来凑在主人耳边小声说道：“这是一个犹太人，自称名叫约克的以撒，我把他领进大厅合适吗？”</p> 
<p>“让葛四行使你的职务，奥斯瓦尔德，”汪八说，他一贯自作主张，“放猪的充当犹太佬的招待员，这再也合适不过。”</p> 
<p>“圣母马利亚呀！”修道院长说，在身上划了个十字，“一个不信基督的犹太人，还让他走进大厅！”</p> 
<p>“一只犹太狗，”圣殿骑士说道，“居然要跟圣墓的保卫者待在一起？”</p> 
<p>“我保证，”汪八说道，“圣殿骑士不爱跟犹太人待在一起，他爱的只是他们的财产。”</p> 
<p>“安静一些，尊敬的客人们，”塞德里克开口道，“我不能因为你们不喜欢便不接待他。上帝既然让不信基督、顽固不化的整个犹太民族，生存了数不清的年代，我们自然也可以容忍一个犹太人在我们中间待几个小时。但是我不想强迫任何人与他一起吃饭或谈话。我们可以给他单独开饭，不过，”他又笑着道，“如果这些戴头巾的外国人愿意让他同席，那就不必这么做了。”</p> 
<p>“庄主先生，”圣殿骑士道，“我的萨拉森奴仆是真正的穆斯林，也像任何基督徒一样，不愿与犹太人往来。”</p> 
<p>“这倒奇了，”汪八插口道，“我看不出穆罕默德和特马冈特(注)的崇拜者，与犹太人有多大的差别，犹太人一度还是上帝的选民呢。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)特马冈特，十字军杜撰的恶神的名字，认为这便是萨拉森人崇泰的神。。</p> 
<p>“那么让他跟你坐在一起，汪八，”塞德里克说，“傻瓜和贱民应该是很好的搭档。”</p> 
<p>“傻瓜不怕他，”汪八答道，举起了一块吃剩的咸猪肉，“我会在他面前筑起一道防波堤。”(注)</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)犹太教把猪肉等视为不洁之物，不得取食或接触，因此对犹太人举起猪肉便可以使他们退避三舍。</p> 
<p>“别作声，”塞德里克说，“瞧，他来了。”</p> 
<p>给不太有礼貌地带进来的那个人，露出惶恐和犹豫的神态，向餐桌的下首走去；他佝偻着身子，一边还不断地鞠躬；这本来是一个又瘦又高的老人，只是由于长期弯腰的习惯，几乎看不出他有多高了。他那清癯端正的容貌，那鹰钩鼻，那炯炯有神的黑眼睛，那布满皱纹的高高的额头，那灰白的长长的须发，应该算得上是漂亮的，然而只因它们带有犹太种族的特色，便成了卑贱的标志润为在那个黑暗的时代里，这个种族不仅遭到一般群众中幼稚轻信、思想简单的人的普遍歧视，也成了贪婪和残忍的贵族迫害的对象，但或许正是这种歧视和迫害，使这些人养成了一种民族性格，在这种性格中，至少可以说包含着许多鄙陋和庸俗的成分。</p> 
<p>犹太人的衣服看来遭到了暴风雨的严重摧残，那是一件朴素的黄褐色土布外套，上面有许多褶子，里边是深紫色长袍。他脚登一双镶皮毛的大靴子，腰里束着皮带，带上挂着裁纸刀和文具袋，但没有武器。他的帽子很别致，是一种方顶黄色小帽，那是规定犹太人戴的，使他们与基督徒有所区别，但到了大厅门口，他便把它摘下了。</p> 
<p>这个人在撒克逊人塞德里克的大厅中受到的接待，也许是连最仇视以色列各宗族的人也会感到满意的。塞德里克本人对犹太人的一再哈腰致意，只是冷冷地点了点头，示意他在餐桌的末端就座，然而没有一个人让座位给他。相反，他沿着餐桌走去，向围坐在那儿下首的每一个人投出胆怯而乞求同情的目光时，那些撒克逊仆人却伸开双臂安然不动，继续扑在桌上狼吞虎咽，对新到的客人的需要不理不睬，佯作不知。修道院长的仆从在身上划十字，露出了虔诚惶恐的脸色，连那些萨拉森异教徒，看到以撒走近，也怒冲冲地捻着络腮胡子，还把手搭到了他们的短剑上，仿佛准备用最粗暴的手段阻挡他的接近，免得沾染他的邪气似的。</p> 
<p>按理说，塞德里克既然宽大为怀，肯向那个被歧视民族的一个儿子打开大厅的门，他也应该会坚持要他的仆人在接待以撒时以礼相待；可惜修道院长正在与他讨论他心爱的猎狗的品种和习性，这是他最感兴趣的话题，一个犹太人饿着肚子上床这种微不足道的事，自然不在他的心上，不会使他中断他的谈话。这样，以撒只得像个无家可归的孤儿站在一边，找不到座位，也没人理睬，就像他的民族给排斥在世界各国之外一样。这时，坐在壁炉旁边的朝圣者对他产生了同情，把自己的座位让给了他，向他简单地说道：“老头儿，我的衣服干了，肚子也吃饱了，可是你还又湿又饿呢。”他一边这么讲，一边把大壁炉里散开的木炭拨到一起，还从大餐桌上搬了一份浓汤和滚热的山羊肉，放在他刚才吃饭用的小桌子上，没等犹太人道谢，便走到大厅的另一头去了——这是他不愿与他照料的人发生更多的接触，还是急于到餐桌的上首去，似乎很难确定。</p> 
<p>要是在那种日子里，有画家能把这样的场面画下来，那么犹太人弓起。瞧怀的身子，对着火伸出冰凉发抖的手的情景，便可成为一幅像征寒冬的拟人化图画。他让身子暖和一些以后，马上转过身子，对着放在他面前的热气腾腾的食物吃了起来；他吃得很快，显得津津有味，由此可见，他早已饥肠辘辘了。</p> 
<p>这时，修道院长和塞德里克仍在讨论他们的打猎；罗文娜小姐似乎跟她的一个使女在聊天；那位气焰嚣张的圣殿骑士则把眼睛在撒克逊美女和犹太人之间来回转动，仿佛他正在心中盘算，他究竟应该更关心哪一个。</p> 
<p>“尊敬的塞德里克，”修道院长在高谈阔论中突然说道，“我觉得奇怪，您对您本国的完美语言这么爱如珠宝，却不肯接受诺曼法语，可是至少在有关森林和狩猎的奥秘方面，这种语言是值得重视的。毫无疑问，野外运动所需要的各种词语，它无不应有尽有，经验丰富的猎手可以为他的乐趣找到各种表现手段。”</p> 
<p>“尊敬的艾默长老，”撒克逊人答道，“不妨向您直说，我并不希罕海外的那些华丽辞藻，没有它们，我照样可以在树林中得到娱乐。我能吹我的号角，尽管我不能把这种号声称作recheat或mort，我也能嗾使我的狗捕捉猎物，在捉到猎物后把它们开膛剖肚，不必非要用cur6e、arbor、nombles等等新奇的行话不可，这一切只是那位传说中的特里斯特勒姆骑士发明的废话。”(注)</p>

<p>(注)诺曼人把狩猎用语与普通生活用语截然分开，这是其他语言所没有的。他们把捕捉的猎物，不论飞禽或走兽，都按年龄一年换一个名称，不懂得这一百来个通用的名称，便是丧失了绅士所应该具备的一个必要条件。关于这问题，读者可参阅朱莉安娜·巴恩斯的书。据说这门学问的首创者便是著名的骑士特里斯特勒姆，那个因与美丽的伊瑟尔特的爱情悲剧而闻名的人物。由于诺曼人把狩猎严格看作自己独享的娱乐，这些正式的行话用的都是法语。——原注。按朱莉安娜·巴思斯是十五世纪英国的一个女作家，曾任修道院长，编写过一本《狩猎艺术》。特里斯特勒姆，又称特里斯丹，传说人物，据说曾是亚瑟王的圆桌骑士之一。他与美丽的公主伊瑟尔特相爱，经过各种曲折，最后两人殉情而死。</p> 
<p>“法语不仅是狩猎的自然语言，在赢得爱情和征服敌人的战斗中，它也是最自然的语言，”圣殿骑士提高了嗓音，用他一贯使用的盛气凌人、自以为是的口气说道。</p> 
<p>“我们干一杯，骑士阁下，”塞德里克说道，“也给院长斟一杯；让我回忆一下，再把三十年前的往事讲给你们听听。那时，我这个撒克逊人塞德里克讲的都是普通的英语，哪怕谈情说爱，也不必搬弄法国行吟诗人歌词中的美丽辞藻；在圣合大战(注)那一天，诺萨勒顿的战场也会告诉大家，撒克逊战士冲锋陷阵的呐喊声，也像最勇敢的诺曼绅士的喊杀声一样，曾经传播在苏格兰大军的阵地上。客人们，为了曾在那里战斗过的英雄们干杯吧！”他把酒一饮而尽，又意气风发地往下说，“啊，那真是你死我活的战斗，千百面旗子在勇士们的头顶向前飞驰，地上血流成河，每个人都不怕牺牲，视死如归。一个撒克逊吟游诗人称这是军刀的盛宴，猛禽的攫食，剑戟对盾牌和盔甲的冲击，战场上杀声震天，比婚宴上的欢呼声更加热烈。但是现在这样的歌声没有了，”他又道，“我们的事迹已湮灭在另一个民族的事迹中；我们的语言，甚至我们的姓名，都在迅速消亡；可是除了一个孤独的老人，没有人为此悲痛。斟酒的，你这混蛋，把杯子筛满。骑士阁下，让我们为坚强的战士干杯，不论他属于哪个民族，用的什么语言，只要他是今天巴勒斯坦的十字军中最勇猛的战士！”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)圣纛大战，苏格兰国王戴维一世与英王斯蒂芬进行的一场血战，战斗于1138年8月22日在约克郡的诺萨勒顿附近展开。</p> 
<p>“戴有这肩章的人对这话可不能随声附和，”布里思·布瓦吉贝尔说道，“因为除了圣墓的誓死保卫者，还有谁可以得到这样的荣誉呢？”</p> 
<p>“还有医护骑士团(注)的骑士们，”院长说，“我有一个兄弟在那个骑士团中战斗。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)医护骑士团，十字军中另一个著名的骑士组织，主要由意大利骑士组成，因以医护伤员为主要任务，故名，又称圣约翰骑士团。</p> 
<p>“我不想低毁他们的名誉，”圣殿骑士说，“不过……”</p> 
<p>“我想，塞德里克老朋友，”汪八插口道，“狮心王理查要是聪明一些，肯采纳一个傻瓜的忠告，他还是别出外奔波，跟快活的英格兰人一起待在家里的好，至于耶路撒冷，让那些丢掉它的骑士去收复它得了。”</p> 
<p>“在英国军队中，除了圣殿骑士和圣约翰骑士以外，难道真的没有一个人值得一提吗？”罗文娜小姐说道。</p> 
<p>“请原谅，小姐，”布瓦吉贝尔答道。“英国国王确实率领了一大批英勇的武士前往巴勒斯坦，但是他们与坚定不移地用自己的胸膛保卫圣地的人相比，还是差了一些。”</p> 
<p>“比什么人也不差，”朝圣者突然插口道，他正站在附近，听了这些议论，早已按捺不住。这句出乎意外的话使大家都向他转过了脸去。朝圣者又用坚定而沉着的声音继续道：“我是说，在一切用剑保卫圣地的人中，英国的骑士并不比任何人差。而且我得说——因为这是我亲眼所见——在攻占艾克的圣约翰教堂后，理查王本人和他的五位骑士，曾举行过一次比武大会，作为挑战者战败了一切人的进攻。我还得说，在那一天他们每人都战斗了三次，每次都把对手打翻在地上。我还得补充一句：这些进攻者中，有七个是圣殿骑士团的骑士；布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔爵士也完全知道，我讲的都是事实。”</p> 
<p>圣殿骑士一听这话，顿时满面怒容，那张黝黑的脸也变得更黑了，简直不是笔墨所能形容的。他的狼狈和气愤都达到了顶点，以致手指索索发抖，伸到了剑柄上，也许只是由于意识到，在这样的场合和这些人面前，使用武力并不合适，才没有真的拔出剑来。塞德里克是个性情直爽，十分单纯的人，不大会同时考虑到两件事，现在听到他的同胞的光辉事迹，不禁心花怒放，以致根本没有注意他那位客人恼怒惊慌的样子。他说道：“参拜过圣地的人，如果你能告诉我，那些使快活的英格兰扬眉吐气的英勇骑士都是谁，我就把这只金镯子送给你。”</p> 
<p>“那正是我所乐意做的，”朝圣者答道，“不需要报酬，我许过愿，在一段时间内不接触黄金。”</p> 
<p>“你同意的话，我可以替你戴镯子，朝圣者朋友，”汪八插嘴道。</p> 
<p>“第一位武艺高强又地位显赫的，便是英国勇敢的理查国王，”朝圣者说。</p> 
<p>“很好，”塞德里克说道，“尽管他是暴君威廉公爵的后代，对这点我可以不予计较。”</p> 
<p>“莱斯特伯爵是第二位，”朝圣者继续道。“吉尔斯兰的托马斯·麦尔顿爵士居第三位。”</p> 
<p>“他至少是撒克逊血统，”塞德里克兴奋地说。</p> 
<p>“第四位是福克·杜依利爵士，”朝圣者接着道。</p> 
<p>“他也是撒克逊人，至少从母亲方面说是这样，”塞德里克继续道，他听得非常起劲，以致陶醉在英国国王和英伦三岛臣民取得的共同胜利中，至少把他对诺曼人的仇恨忘记了一部分。“谁是第五位？”他问道。</p> 
<p>“第五位是埃德温·特尼汉姆爵士。”</p> 
<p>“他是真正的撒克逊人，不愧是亨吉斯特(注)的后代！”塞德里克大喊，接着又兴奋地问道：“第六位呢？……第六位名叫什么？”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)亨吉斯特，传说中最早来到不列颠的盎格鲁一撒克逊人的领袖，他于公元455年在肯特郡建立了第一个微克逊人的王国，英国历史上的所谓七国时代便是从这时开始。</p> 
<p>“第六位……”朝圣者似乎在努力回忆，停顿了一下以后说，“那是一个年轻的骑士，地位较低，也不太显赫，在那群光辉的人物中不起重要作用，只是凑数而已；他的名字我一时想不起来了。”</p> 
<p>“得啦，朝圣者先生，”布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔骑士用讥笑的口气说道，“你这是装忘记，你刚才对一切都记得清清楚楚，现在这么讲太迟了。我可以来补充这位骑士的名字，尽管命运和战马的失足，曾使我摔倒在他的长枪前面；那是艾文荷骑士，他虽然年轻，论武艺和声望，六个人中没有人能超过他。然而我得说，而且大声地说，要是他目前在英国，敢在本周的比武大会上；像在艾克一样向我挑战，我保证，不论他使用什么武器，我凭我现在的坐骑和刀剑，便可打败他。”</p> 
<p>“可惜你的对手不在这儿，否则你的挑战马上可以实现，”朝圣者答道。“在目前的情况下你很清楚，这场决斗不可能发生，因此对它的结局大事吹嘘，扰乱这间和平的大厅，似乎大可不必。不过一旦艾文荷从巴勒斯坦回来，我可以保证，他会接受你的挑战。”</p> 
<p>“讲得很漂亮！”圣殿骑士道，“那么你拿什么作保证呢？”</p> 
<p>“这只圣物盒，”朝圣者说，从胸前掏出了一只小象牙盒，在身上画了个十字，“它里边装的东西，是从加尔默罗山修道院(注)的真正十字架上取来的。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)加尔默罗修会，又称“圣衣会”，于十二世纪创建于巴勒斯坦的加尔默罗山，系天主教托钵修会之一。</p> 
<p>茹尔沃修道院院长在身上画了个十字，念了一句祷告，在场的人除了犹太人、穆斯林和圣殿骑士，都跟着他念了一遍。圣殿骑士没有摘下帽子，也没对那件所谓圣物表示任何敬意，只是从脖子上取下一根金项链，把它丢在餐桌上，说道：“我和这个无名的流浪汉的信物，由艾默长老保管，它们表示，在艾文荷骑士回到不列颠本土以后，他应立即对布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔的挑战作出反应，如果他不接受，我便得在欧洲每一个圣殿的墙上宣布他是个懦夫。”</p> 
<p>“不必这样，”罗文娜小姐突然打破沉默，说道。“如果在这大厅里没有人出声，那么让我代表现在不在的艾文荷讲句话。我相信，他会光明磊落地接受任何正直的挑战。要是我的无力保证可以给这位朝圣者极其珍贵的信物，增添一些分量，那么我用我的名义和荣誉担保，艾文荷骑士一定会让这位骄傲的骑士如愿以偿。”</p> 
<p>许多互相矛盾的心情，似乎控制了塞德里克，使他在这场争论中保持着沉默。得到满足的自尊心、愤怒和困惑，从他开阔的额上流露出来，它们此起彼伏，互相追逐，像一朵朵乌云投下的阴影在麦田上飘过。与此同时，第六位骑士的名字似乎在他那些仆人的眉宇间引起了强烈的反应，他们纷纷把目光汇集到了主人的脸上。但是罗文娜一开口，她的声音立即惊醒了他。</p> 
<p>“小姐，”塞德里克开口道，“这不太合适；如果还需要人担保，那么尽管我遭到了伤害，我的气愤是理所当然的，我还是愿意拿我的荣誉给艾文荷的荣誉作担保。现在，哪怕按照诺曼骑士制度的荒谬方式，准备决斗的手续完备了。是不是，艾默长老？”</p> 
<p>“是的，”院长答道。“在这场准军事行动决定胜负之前，可以暂且把圣物和贵重的链子保存在我们修道院的库房中。”</p> 
<p>他一边这么说，一边在身上一再画十字，又行了几次跪拜礼，念了几遍祷告，这才把圣物盒交给他的随从安布罗斯修士，又亲自把金链子收起来，放进他衣袖下的一只香皮村里的袋子内，礼节虽没那么繁琐，但也许更加郑重其事。“现在，塞德里克阁下，”他说道，“您的美酒已发挥作用，使我的耳朵嗡嗡直响了，请允许我再敬罗文娜小姐一杯，然后便即告退，回房休息。”</p> 
<p>“凭基督受难十字架起誓，”撒克逊人说，“您的酒量一向有名，喝这一点算得什么，院长阁下！人家告诉我，您是一个快活的修士，在听到晨祷的钟声以前是不会放下酒杯的；我一直担心我老了，在喝酒上面不是您的对手呢。不过我保证，在我年轻的时候，连一个十二岁的撒克逊孩子，也不会这么快就放下酒杯。”</p> 
<p>然而修道院长坚持适可而止，是有他的道理的。不仅从职务上看，他应该是个和事佬，而且在实际生活中，他也厌恶一切仇恨和争吵。这不仅出于对邻人的爱，或者为了独善其身，或者两者兼而有之。在目前的场合，他对那个撒克逊人暴躁的脾气，怀有本能的戒惧，他的朋友又那么鲁莽和自负，已好几次差点发作，长老担心，这迟早会惹出事来，弄得大家不欢而散。因此他客气地表示，任何一个国家的人，都无法在酒量上与强壮耐劳、坚定沉着的撒克逊人比试高下；他还委婉地提了一下他所担任的圣职，最后声明他们必须告退了。</p> 
<p>于是举行了一次最后的祝酒，客人们便在对主人和罗文娜小姐再三道谢之后，站起身来，在大厅中分手了；家中的两位主人则在各自的仆人簇拥下，从不同的门退出。</p> 
<p>圣殿骑士在穿过人群时，对犹太人以撒说道：“不信基督的狗，你也打算到比武大会上凑热闹吗？”</p> 
<p>“是的，想去见识见识，”以撒卑躬屈膝地口答，“如果您老不反对的话。”</p> 
<p>“嘿，”骑士说道，“用高利贷吸我们贵族的血，用不值钱的小玩意儿骗妇女孩子们的钱，我敢打赌，犹太佬的腰包都装得鼓鼓的了。”</p> 
<p>“我没有钱，一个钱也没有，半个钱也没有，亚伯拉罕的上帝可以作证！”犹太人说，握紧了双手。“我现在便是想去找我们本族的一个弟兄帮忙，好让我付清犹太人税务所(注)的罚款，愿我们的始祖雅各保佑我吧！我现在真是穷困潦倒，连身上穿的这件粗布长袍，也是向塔德卡斯特镇的鲁本借的呢。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)在那些日子里、设有专管犹太人的税务所，它对他们课征的苛捐杂税名目繁多。——原注</p> 
<p>圣殿骑士露出阴险的笑容，答道：“谎话连篇，该死的东西！”说罢便扬长而去，仿佛不屑再理睬他，然后跟那些穆斯林奴隶用别人不懂的语言交谈起来。但这个又像武士、又像修士的人的几句话，已把可怜的以色列人吓得心惊胆战，直到圣殿骑士走到了大厅的末端，他才敢伸直佝楼的腰板，抬起头来，发现那位老爷早已走远了。他睁大眼睛向周围打量着，那副神气似乎他面前刚响过一阵惊雷，隆隆的雷声还在他耳边回荡。</p> 
<p>过了不多一会，圣殿骑士和修道院长已在总管和斟酒人的引领下，走进了各自的卧室，每人都有两个举火炬的侍役和两个端食物的仆人跟随着。他们的随从和其他客人，则由地位较低的仆人带往各人的住处。</p>
