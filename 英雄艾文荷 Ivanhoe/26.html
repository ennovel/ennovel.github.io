Douglas</p> 
<p>While the scenes we have described were passing in other parts of the castle, the Jewess Rebecca awaited her fate in a distant and sequestered turret. Hither she had been led by two of her disguised ravishers, and on being thrust into the little cell, she found herself in the presence of an old sibyl, who kept murmuring to herself a Saxon rhyme, as if to beat time to the revolving dance which her spindle was performing upon the floor. The hag raised her head as Rebecca entered, and scowled at the fair Jewess with the malignant envy with which old age and ugliness, when united with evil conditions, are apt to look upon youth and beauty.</p> 
<p>"Thou must up and away, old house-cricket," said one of the men; "our noble master commands it---Thou must e'en leave this chamber to a fairer guest."</p> 
<p>"Ay," grumbled the hag, "even thus is service requited. I have known when my bare word would have cast the best man-at-arms among ye out of saddle and out of service; and now must I up and away at the command of every groom such as thou."</p> 
<p>"Good Dame Urfried," said the other man, "stand not to reason on it, but up and away. Lords' hests must be listened to with a quick ear. Thou hast had thy day, old dame, but thy sun has long been set. Thou art now the very emblem of an old war-horse turned out on the barren heath---thou hast had thy paces in thy time, but now a broken amble is the best of them---Come, amble off with thee."</p> 
<p>"Ill omens dog ye both!" said the old woman; "and a kennel be your burying-place! May the evil demon Zernebock tear me limb from limb, if I leave my own cell ere I have spun out the hemp on my distaff!"</p> 
<p>"Answer it to our lord, then, old housefiend," said the man, and retired; leaving Rebecca in company with the old woman, upon whose presence she had been thus unwillingly forced.</p> 
<p>"What devil's deed have they now in the wind?" said the old hag, murmuring to herself, yet from time to time casting a sidelong and malignant glance at Rebecca; "but it is easy to guess ---Bright eyes, black locks, and a skin like paper, ere the priest stains it with his black unguent---Ay, it is easy to guess why they send her to this lone turret, whence a shriek could no more be heard than at the depth of five hundred fathoms beneath the earth.---Thou wilt have owls for thy neighbours, fair one; and their screams will be heard as far, and as much regarded, as thine own. Outlandish, too," she said, marking the dress and turban of Rebecca---"What country art thou of?---a Saracen? or an Egyptian?---Why dost not answer?---thou canst weep, canst thou not speak?"</p> 
<p>"Be not angry, good mother," said Rebecca.</p> 
<p>"Thou needst say no more," replied Urfried "men know a fox by the train, and a Jewess by her tongue."</p> 
<p>"For the sake of mercy," said Rebecca, "tell me what I am to expect as the conclusion of the violence which hath dragged me hither! Is it my life they seek, to atone for my religion? I will lay it down cheerfully."</p> 
<p>"Thy life, minion?" answered the sibyl; "what would taking thy life pleasure them?---Trust me, thy life is in no peril. Such usage shalt thou have as was once thought good enough for a noble Saxon maiden. And shall a Jewess, like thee, repine because she hath no better? Look at me---I was as young and twice as fair as thou, when Front-de-Boeuf, father of this Reginald, and his Normans, stormed this castle. My father and his seven sons defended their inheritance from story to story, from chamber to chamber---There was not a room, not a step of the stair, that was not slippery with their blood. They died---they died every man; and ere their bodies were cold, and ere their blood was dried, I had become the prey and the scorn of the conqueror!"</p> 
<p>"Is there no help?---Are there no means of escape?" said Rebecca ---"Richly, richly would I requite thine aid."</p> 
<p>"Think not of it," said the hag; "from hence there is no escape but through the gates of death; and it is late, late," she added, shaking her grey head, "ere these open to us---Yet it is comfort to think that we leave behind us on earth those who shall be wretched as ourselves. Fare thee well, Jewess!---Jew or Gentile, thy fate would be the same; for thou hast to do with them that have neither scruple nor pity. Fare thee well, I say. My thread is spun out---thy task is yet to begin."</p> 
<p>"Stay! stay! for Heaven's sake!" said Rebecca; "stay, though it be to curse and to revile me ---thy presence is yet some protection."</p> 
<p>"The presence of the mother of God were no protection," answered the old woman. "There she stands," pointing to a rude image of the Virgin Mary, "see if she can avert the fate that awaits thee."</p> 
<p>She left the room as she spoke, her features writhed into a sort of sneering laugh, which made them seem even more hideous than their habitual frown. She locked the door behind her, and Rebecca might hear her curse every step for its steepness, as slowly and with difficulty she descended the turret-stair.</p> 
<p>Rebecca was now to expect a fate even more dreadful than that of Rowena; for what probability was there that either softness or ceremony would be used towards one of her oppressed race, whatever shadow of these might be preserved towards a Saxon heiress? Yet had the Jewess this advantage, that she was better prepared by habits of thought, and by natural strength of mind, to encounter the dangers to which she was exposed. Of a strong and observing character, even from her earliest years, the pomp and wealth which her father displayed within his walls, or which she witnessed in the houses of other wealthy Hebrews, had not been able to blind her to the precarious circumstances under which they were enjoyed. Like Damocles at his celebrated banquet, Rebecca perpetually beheld, amid that gorgeous display, the sword which was suspended over the heads of her people by a single hair. These reflections had tamed and brought down to a pitch of sounder judgment a temper, which, under other circumstances, might have waxed haughty, supercilious, and obstinate.</p> 
<p>From her father's example and injunctions, Rebecca had learnt to bear herself courteously towards all who approached her. She could not indeed imitate his excess of subservience, because she was a stranger to the meanness of mind, and to the constant state of timid apprehension, by which it was dictated; but she bore herself with a proud humility, as if submitting to the evil circumstances in which she was placed as the daughter of a despised race, while she felt in her mind the consciousness that she was entitled to hold a higher rank from her merit, than the arbitrary despotism of religious prejudice permitted her to aspire to.</p> 
<p>Thus prepared to expect adverse circumstances, she had acquired the firmness necessary for acting under them. Her present situation required all her presence of mind, and she summoned it up accordingly.</p> 
<p>Her first care was to inspect the apartment; but it afforded few hopes either of escape or protection. It contained neither secret passage nor trap-door, and unless where the door by which she had entered joined the main building, seemed to be circumscribed by the round exterior wall of the turret. The door had no inside bolt or bar. The single window opened upon an embattled space surmounting the turret, which gave Rebecca, at first sight, some hopes of escaping; but she soon found it had no communication with any other part of the battlements, being an isolated bartisan, or balcony, secured, as usual, by a parapet, with embrasures, at which a few archers might be stationed for defending the turret, and flanking with their shot the wall of the castle on that side.</p> 
<p>There was therefore no hope but in passive fortitude, and in that strong reliance on Heaven natural to great and generous characters. Rebecca, however erroneously taught to interpret the promises of Scripture to the chosen people of Heaven, did not err in supposing the present to be their hour of trial, or in trusting that the children of Zion would be one day called in with the fulness of the Gentiles. In the meanwhile, all around her showed that their present state was that of punishment and probation, and that it was their especial duty to suffer without sinning. Thus prepared to consider herself as the victim of misfortune, Rebecca had early reflected upon her own state, and schooled her mind to meet the dangers which she had probably to encounter.</p> 
<p>The prisoner trembled, however, and changed colour, when a step was heard on the stair, and the door of the turret-chamber slowly opened, and a tall man, dressed as one of those banditti to whom they owed their misfortune, slowly entered, and shut the door behind him; his cap, pulled down upon his brows, concealed the upper part of his face, and he held his mantle in such a manner as to muffle the rest. In this guise, as if prepared for the execution of some deed, at the thought of which he was himself ashamed, he stood before the affrighted prisoner; yet, ruffian as his dress bespoke him, he seemed at a loss to express what purpose had brought him thither, so that Rebecca, making an effort upon herself, had time to anticipate his explanation. She had already unclasped two costly bracelets and a collar, which she hastened to proffer to the supposed outlaw, concluding naturally that to gratify his avarice was to bespeak his favour.</p> 
<p>"Take these," she said, "good friend, and for God's sake be merciful to me and my aged father! These ornaments are of value, yet are they trifling to what he would bestow to obtain our dismissal from this castle, free and uninjured."</p> 
<p>"Fair flower of Palestine," replied the outlaw, "these pearls are orient, but they yield in whiteness to your teeth; the diamonds are brilliant, but they cannot match your eyes; and ever since I have taken up this wild trade, I have made a vow to prefer beauty to wealth."</p> 
<p>"Do not do yourself such wrong," said Rebecca; "take ransom, and have mercy!---Gold will purchase you pleasure,---to misuse us, could only bring thee remorse. My father will willingly satiate thy utmost wishes; and if thou wilt act wisely, thou mayst purchase with our spoils thy restoration to civil society---mayst obtain pardon for past errors, and be placed beyond the necessity of committing more."</p> 
<p>"It is well spoken," replied the outlaw in French, finding it difficult probably to sustain, in Saxon, a conversation which Rebecca had opened in that language; "but know, bright lily of the vale of Baca! that thy father is already in the hands of a powerful alchemist, who knows how to convert into gold and silver even the rusty bars of a dungeon grate. The venerable Isaac is subjected to an alembic, which will distil from him all he holds dear, without any assistance from my requests or thy entreaty. The ransom must be paid by love and beauty, and in no other coin will I accept it."</p> 
<p>"Thou art no outlaw," said Rebecca, in the same language in which he addressed her; "no outlaw had refused such offers. No outlaw in this land uses the dialect in which thou hast spoken. Thou art no outlaw, but a Norman---a Norman, noble perhaps in birth ---O, be so in thy actions, and cast off this fearful mask of outrage and violence!"</p> 
<p>"And thou, who canst guess so truly," said Brian de Bois-Guilbert, dropping the mantle from his face, "art no true daughter of Israel, but in all, save youth and beauty, a very witch of Endor. I am not an outlaw, then, fair rose of Sharon. And I am one who will be more prompt to hang thy neck and arms with pearls and diamonds, which so well become them, than to deprive thee of these ornaments."</p> 
<p>"What wouldst thou have of me," said Rebecca, "if not my wealth? ---We can have nought in common between us---you are a Christian ---I am a Jewess.---Our union were contrary to the laws, alike of the church and the synagogue."</p> 
<p>"It were so, indeed," replied the Templar, laughing; "wed with a Jewess? 'Despardieux!'---Not if she were the Queen of Sheba! And know, besides, sweet daughter of Zion, that were the most Christian king to offer me his most Christian daughter, with Languedoc for a dowery, I could not wed her. It is against my vow to love any maiden, otherwise than 'par amours', as I will love thee. I am a Templar. Behold the cross of my Holy Order."</p> 
<p>"Darest thou appeal to it," said Rebecca, "on an occasion like the present?"</p> 
<p>"And if I do so," said the Templar, "it concerns not thee, who art no believer in the blessed sign of our salvation."</p> 
<p>"I believe as my fathers taught," said Rebecca; "and may God forgive my belief if erroneous! But you, Sir Knight, what is yours, when you appeal without scruple to that which you deem most holy, even while you are about to transgress the most solemn of your vows as a knight, and as a man of religion?"</p> 
<p>"It is gravely and well preached, O daughter of Sirach!" answered the Templar; "but, gentle Ecclesiastics, thy narrow Jewish prejudices make thee blind to our high privilege. Marriage were an enduring crime on the part of a Templar; but what lesser folly I may practise, I shall speedily be absolved from at the next Preceptory of our Order. Not the wisest of monarchs, not his father, whose examples you must needs allow are weighty, claimed wider privileges than we poor soldiers of the Temple of Zion have won by our zeal in its defence. The protectors of Solomon's Temple may claim license by the example of Solomon."</p> 
<p>"If thou readest the Scripture," said the Jewess, "and the lives of the saints, only to justify thine own license and profligacy, thy crime is like that of him who extracts poison from the most healthful and necessary herbs."</p> 
<p>The eyes of the Templar flashed fire at this reproof---"Hearken," he said, "Rebecca; I have hitherto spoken mildly to thee, but now my language shall be that of a conqueror. Thou art the captive of my bow and spear---subject to my will by the laws of all nations; nor will I abate an inch of my right, or abstain from taking by violence what thou refusest to entreaty or necessity."</p> 
<p>"Stand back," said Rebecca---"stand back, and hear me ere thou offerest to commit a sin so deadly! My strength thou mayst indeed overpower for God made women weak, and trusted their defence to man's generosity. But I will proclaim thy villainy, Templar, from one end of Europe to the other. I will owe to the superstition of thy brethren what their compassion might refuse me, Each Preceptory---each Chapter of thy Order, shall learn, that, like a heretic, thou hast sinned with a Jewess. Those who tremble not at thy crime, will hold thee accursed for having so far dishonoured the cross thou wearest, as to follow a daughter of my people."</p> 
<p>"Thou art keen-witted, Jewess," replied the Templar, well aware of the truth of what she spoke, and that the rules of his Order condemned in the most positive manner, and under high penalties, such intrigues as he now prosecuted, and that, in some instances, even degradation had followed upon it---"thou art sharp-witted," he said; "but loud must be thy voice of complaint, if it is heard beyond the iron walls of this castle; within these, murmurs, laments, appeals to justice, and screams for help, die alike silent away. One thing only can save thee, Rebecca. Submit to thy fate---embrace our religion, and thou shalt go forth in such state, that many a Norman lady shall yield as well in pomp as in beauty to the favourite of the best lance among the defenders of the Temple."</p> 
<p>"Submit to my fate!" said Rebecca---"and, sacred Heaven! to what fate?---embrace thy religion! and what religion can it be that harbours such a villain?---THOU the best lance of the Templars! ---Craven knight!---forsworn priest! I spit at thee, and I defy thee.---The God of Abraham's promise hath opened an escape to his daughter---even from this abyss of infamy!"</p> 
<p>As she spoke, she threw open the latticed window which led to the bartisan, and in an instant after, stood on the very verge of the parapet, with not the slightest screen between her and the tremendous depth below. Unprepared for such a desperate effort, for she had hitherto stood perfectly motionless, Bois-Guilbert had neither time to intercept nor to stop her. As he offered to advance, she exclaimed, "Remain where thou art, proud Templar, or at thy choice advance!---one foot nearer, and I plunge myself from the precipice; my body shall be crushed out of the very form of humanity upon the stones of that court-yard, ere it become the victim of thy brutality!"</p> 
<p>As she spoke this, she clasped her hands and extended them towards heaven, as if imploring mercy on her soul before she made the final plunge. The Templar hesitated, and a resolution which had never yielded to pity or distress, gave way to his admiration of her fortitude. "Come down," he said, "rash girl!---I swear by earth, and sea, and sky, I will offer thee no offence."</p> 
<p>"I will not trust thee, Templar," said Rebecca; thou hast taught me better how to estimate the virtues of thine Order. The next Preceptory would grant thee absolution for an oath, the keeping of which concerned nought but the honour or the dishonour of a miserable Jewish maiden."</p> 
<p>"You do me injustice," exclaimed the Templar fervently; "I swear to you by the name which I bear---by the cross on my bosom---by the sword on my side---by the ancient crest of my fathers do I swear, I will do thee no injury whatsoever! If not for thyself, yet for thy father's sake forbear! I will be his friend, and in this castle he will need a powerful one."</p> 
<p>"Alas!" said Rebecca, "I know it but too well---dare I trust thee?"</p> 
<p>"May my arms be reversed, and my name dishonoured," said Brian de Bois-Guilbert, "if thou shalt have reason to complain of me! Many a law, many a commandment have I broken, but my word never."</p> 
<p>"I will then trust thee," said Rebecca, "thus far;" and she descended from the verge of the battlement, but remained standing close by one of the embrasures, or "machicolles", as they were then called.---"Here," she said, "I take my stand. Remain where thou art, and if thou shalt attempt to diminish by one step the distance now between us, thou shalt see that the Jewish maiden will rather trust her soul with God, than her honour to the Templar!"</p> 
<p>While Rebecca spoke thus, her high and firm resolve, which corresponded so well with the expressive beauty of her countenance, gave to her looks, air, and manner, a dignity that seemed more than mortal. Her glance quailed not, her cheek blanched not, for the fear of a fate so instant and so horrible; on the contrary, the thought that she had her fate at her command, and could escape at will from infamy to death, gave a yet deeper colour of carnation to her complexion, and a yet more brilliant fire to her eye. Bois-Guilbert, proud himself and high-spirited, thought he had never beheld beauty so animated and so commanding.</p> 
<p>"Let there be peace between us, Rebecca," he said.</p> 
<p>"Peace, if thou wilt," answered Rebecca---"Peace---but with this space between."</p> 
<p>"Thou needst no longer fear me," said Bois-Guilbert.</p> 
<p>"I fear thee not," replied she; "thanks to him that reared this dizzy tower so high, that nought could fall from it and live --thanks to him, and to the God of Israel!---I fear thee not."</p> 
<p>"Thou dost me injustice," said the Templar; "by earth, sea, and sky, thou dost me injustice! I am not naturally that which you have seen me, hard, selfish, and relentless. It was woman that taught me cruelty, and on woman therefore I have exercised it; but not upon such as thou. Hear me, Rebecca---Never did knight take lance in his hand with a heart more devoted to the lady of his love than Brian de Bois-Guilbert. She, the daughter of a petty baron, who boasted for all his domains but a ruinous tower, and an unproductive vineyard, and some few leagues of the barren Landes of Bourdeaux, her name was known wherever deeds of arms were done, known wider than that of many a lady's that had a county for a dowery.---Yes," he continued, pacing up and down the little platform, with an animation in which he seemed to lose all consciousness of Rebecca's presence---"Yes, my deeds, my danger, my blood, made the name of Adelaide de Montemare known from the court of Castile to that of Byzantium. And how was I requited? ---When I returned with my dear-bought honours, purchased by toil and blood, I found her wedded to a Gascon squire, whose name was never heard beyond the limits of his own paltry domain! Truly did I love her, and bitterly did I revenge me of her broken faith! But my vengeance has recoiled on myself. Since that day I have separated myself from life and its ties---My manhood must know no domestic home---must be soothed by no affectionate wife ---My age must know no kindly hearth---My grave must be solitary, and no offspring must outlive me, to bear the ancient name of Bois-Guilbert. At the feet of my Superior I have laid down the right of self-action---the privilege of independence. The Templar, a serf in all but the name, can possess neither lands nor goods, and lives, moves, and breathes, but at the will and pleasure of another."</p> 
<p>"Alas!" said Rebecca, "what advantages could compensate for such an absolute sacrifice?"</p> 
<p>"The power of vengeance, Rebecca," replied the Templar, "and the prospects of ambition."</p> 
<p>"An evil recompense," said Rebecca, "for the surrender of the rights which are dearest to humanity."</p> 
<p>"Say not so, maiden," answered the Templar; "revenge is a feast for the gods! And if they have reserved it, as priests tell us, to themselves, it is because they hold it an enjoyment too precious for the possession of mere mortals.---And ambition? it is a temptation which could disturb even the bliss of heaven itself."---He paused a moment, and then added, "Rebecca! she who could prefer death to dishonour, must have a proud and a powerful soul. Mine thou must be!---Nay, start not," he added, "it must be with thine own consent, and on thine own terms. Thou must consent to share with me hopes more extended than can be viewed from the throne of a monarch!---Hear me ere you answer and judge ere you refuse.---The Templar loses, as thou hast said, his social rights, his power of free agency, but he becomes a member and a limb of a mighty body, before which thrones already tremble,---even as the single drop of rain which mixes with the sea becomes an individual part of that resistless ocean, which undermines rocks and ingulfs royal armadas. Such a swelling flood is that powerful league. Of this mighty Order I am no mean member, but already one of the Chief Commanders, and may well aspire one day to hold the batoon of Grand Master. The poor soldiers of the Temple will not alone place their foot upon the necks of kings---a hemp-sandall'd monk can do that. Our mailed step shall ascend their throne---our gauntlet shall wrench the sceptre from their gripe. Not the reign of your vainly-expected Messiah offers such power to your dispersed tribes as my ambition may aim at. I have sought but a kindred spirit to share it, and I have found such in thee."</p> 
<p>"Sayest thou this to one of my people?" answered Rebecca. "Bethink thee---"</p> 
<p>"Answer me not," said the Templar, "by urging the difference of our creeds; within our secret conclaves we hold these nursery tales in derision. Think not we long remained blind to the idiotical folly of our founders, who forswore every delight of life for the pleasure of dying martyrs by hunger, by thirst, and by pestilence, and by the swords of savages, while they vainly strove to defend a barren desert, valuable only in the eyes of superstition. Our Order soon adopted bolder and wider views, and found out a better indemnification for our sacrifices. Our immense possessions in every kingdom of Europe, our high military fame, which brings within our circle the flower of chivalry from every Christian clime---these are dedicated to ends of which our pious founders little dreamed, and which are equally concealed from such weak spirits as embrace our Order on the ancient principles, and whose superstition makes them our passive tools. But I will not further withdraw the veil of our mysteries. That bugle-sound announces something which may require my presence. Think on what I have said.---Farewell!---I do not say forgive me the violence I have threatened, for it was necessary to the display of thy character. Gold can be only known by the application of the touchstone. I will soon return, and hold further conference with thee."</p> 
<p>He re-entered the turret-chamber, and descended the stair, leaving Rebecca scarcely more terrified at the prospect of the death to which she had been so lately exposed, than at the furious ambition of the bold bad man in whose power she found herself so unhappily placed. When she entered the turret-chamber, her first duty was to return thanks to the God of Jacob for the protection which he had afforded her, and to implore its continuance for her and for her father. Another name glided into her petition---it was that of the wounded Christian, whom fate had placed in the hands of bloodthirsty men, his avowed enemies. Her heart indeed checked her, as if, even in communing with the Deity in prayer, she mingled in her devotions the recollection of one with whose fate hers could have no alliance ---a Nazarene, and an enemy to her faith. But the petition was already breathed, nor could all the narrow prejudices of her sect induce Rebecca to wish it recalled.</p>

<p>(注)苏格兰诗人约翰·霍姆（1722—18O8）写的一个悲剧。</p> 
<p>当我们描写的那一幕幕情景在城堡各处进行时，犹太少女丽贝卡也在远处一座孤立的塔楼中等待自己的命运、她给两个蒙面强人带到这儿，丢进了一间小屋子，发现她面前坐着一个老巫婆；老巫婆咿咿呀呀地哼着一支撒克逊小调，仿佛在给正在地上旋转的她的纺锤打拍子。老太婆发现有人进屋．便抬起头来，对南贝卡皱紧眉头，露出了一副幸灾乐祸的脸色，这是丑老婆子处在恶劣的环境中，看到年轻美貌的小姑娘落到自己这地步，都会有的表倩。</p> 
<p>“你得站起来走啦，老虔婆，”一个蒙面人说，“这是老爷的命令。这间屋子得让给年轻漂亮的客人了。”</p> 
<p>“嗯，”老太婆叨咕道，“这就是对我的报答。我早料到了，从前凭我一句话，就能叫你们中间最好的骑兵滚下马背，丢掉差使；可是现在，像你这种家了居然也来命令我走开了。”</p> 
<p>“我的厄弗利德老大娘，”另一个人说，“别发牢骚啦，还是站起来走吧。老爷的命令必须服从．马虎不得。你有过好日子，老大娘，但是你早已过时啦。现在你好比一只老战马，得赶进荒野了，当年你确实曾经耀武扬威。驰骋在战场上，可如今只配在那里溜花蹄了。好啦，你还是乖乖地走吧。”</p> 
<p>“你们两个都是不祥的狗！”老妇人说，“将来也得埋在狗窝里！我得把这纺竿上的麻线纺完以后，才离开这屋子，要我马上离开，除非让魔鬼把我拖走！”</p> 
<p>“那么老爷怪罪下来，你自己负责吧，老虔婆，”家丁说，随即走了。现在丽贝卡尽管不愿意，也只得跟老妇人单独待在一起了。</p> 
<p>“这些混蛋究竟又要捣什么鬼？”老太婆自言自语似地说，一边不时恶狠狠地瞟一眼丽贝卡。“但这是不难猜到的。明亮的眼睛，乌黑的头发，雪白的皮肤，然而总有一天神父也会给它们涂上不祥的油膏！嗯，这是很容易猜到的，他们把她送到这个孤单的塔楼来，是因为在这里哪怕大喊大叫也没人听到，就像待在深不见底的地洞里一样。小妞儿，今后只有猫头鹰跟你作伴啦；你的哭喊也会像它们的吱吱啼叫那样，谁也听不到，谁也不关心。还是个外国人呢，”看到南贝卡的衣着扭头巾，她又说，“你是哪个国家的人？萨拉森人还是埃及人？为什么不回答？你能够哭，难道不能讲话？”</p> 
<p>“不要生我的气，好妈妈，”丽贝卡说。</p> 
<p>“你不用再说了，”厄弗利德答道，“看到尾巴可以知道是狐狸，听到口＿音就可以知道你是犹太姑娘。”</p> 
<p>“请你行行好吧，”丽贝卡说，“告诉我，他们把我抢到这儿，最后要把我怎么样？是要为我的宗教，把我杀死吗？我这么活着倒不如死了的好。”</p> 
<p>“杀死你，小妞儿！”老太婆答道，“他们要杀死你干什么？相信我，你这条小命是没有危险的。你得到的待遇，不会比从前一个撒克逊贵族小姐的差。你这种犹太姑娘，还有什么可抱怨的？你瞧瞧我吧。从前这个雷金纳德的父亲和他那帮诺曼人攻打这个城堡时，我像你一样年轻，还比你漂亮一倍呢。我的父亲和七个弟兄，为了保卫祖传的产业，从一层楼打到另一层楼，从一间屋子打到另一间屋子。这里没有一个房间，没有一级楼梯，没有洒满他们的鲜血。他们战死了，每个人都死了，在他们的尸体还没冷却，他们的血迹还没凝固时，我已成了战胜者的玩物，遭到了侮辱！”</p> 
<p>“这里没有人能救我吗？没有逃走的办法了吗？”丽贝卡说。“我愿意重重的、重重的报答你的帮助。”</p> 
<p>“还是不要指望吧，”老婆子说，“这里是逃不出去的，除非通过地狱之门；可是这得等很久，很久，这扇门才会向我们打开，”她又说，摇了摇灰白的头。“然而想到我们死后，留在世上的人仍得过同样悲惨的生活，我们便死而无恨了。再见吧，小妞儿！不论你是不是犹太人，你的命运反正一样；因为你总得跟那些人打交道，这些人是既不懂得宽容，也不懂得怜悯的。好啦，祝你幸运。我的麻线纺完了，现在轮到你了。”</p> 
<p>“别走，别走，行行好吧！”丽贝卡说。“别走，哪怕你骂我，咒我，也比让我一个人待着好；你留在这里，对我也是一种保护。”</p> 
<p>“圣母在这里也保护不了你，”老妇人答道。“看，她就在那儿，”她指指一个粗糙的圣母像，“你等着瞧吧，看她能不能改变等待着你的命运。”</p> 
<p>她一边说一边走出房间，还把嘴一撇，露出了轻蔑的嘲笑，这比刚才那种温怒的表情叫人看了更不舒服。她出去后，随手锁上了门；丽贝卡可以听到她走下楼梯的声音，梯子太陡，她走一步便骂一声，走得又慢又困难。</p> 
<p>丽贝卡面临的命运，甚至比罗文娜的更可怕；因为对一个撒克逊女继承人多少得保持一点文明礼貌，可是对丽贝卡那种被压迫民族的人，何必讲究这一套呢？然而她也有她的有利条件，那就是她的思维习惯和她天生的坚强意志，为她应付眼前的危险作了较好的准备。她具有坚定而敏锐的性格，从童年时代起，她父亲在家庭范围内表现的豪华和阔绰的排场，或者她在其他希伯来富人家中目睹的奢靡生活，没有封住她的眼睛，使她看不到他们的享乐生活中包含的危机。丽贝卡像这漠克利斯在那次著名的宴会上一样，始终在富丽堂皇的场面中看到，有一把剑用一根头发丝悬挂在她那个民族的头顶上(注)。这样的想象，对她那种在别的环境下可能变得骄傲自大、目空一切、任性固执的性格，起了制约与调和作用，使她得以保持着清醒的头脑。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)据希腊神话，叙拉古人达漠克利斯常羡慕帝王的幸福，于是有一天叙拉古王请他赴宴，在他的座位上用头发丝挂着一把利剑，使他惊恐万状，知道帝王的处境正是这样，灾难随时可以降临到他们头上。</p> 
<p>从父亲的行为和教导中，丽贝卡学会了待人接物谦虚谨慎的作风。确实，她不可能像她的父亲那样卑躬屈膝，低声下气，因为她与这种庸俗的心理，以及它所要求的经常诚惶诚恐的外表，是格格不入的；她保持着既尊重自己，又尊重别人的态度，仿佛她意识到，她作为一个被蔑视的民族的女子，不得不接受她所处的恶劣环境，但这只是专横跋扈的宗教偏见强加给她的，按照她的品质，她却有权取得更高的地位。</p> 
<p>她对逆境有了这种心理准备，便获得了与它周旋的必要的精神力量。目前的处境需要她沉着应付一切，她也就尽量这么做。</p> 
<p>她想到的第一件事便是观察这间屋子，但看来要从这里逃走，或靠它保护，都是没有指望的。它既没有秘密通道，也没有暗门，除了她进来的那扇门连接主要的建筑以外，几乎全部由塔楼的外墙所包围。那扇门里边没有门闩或插销。整个屋子只有一扇窗，窗外的平台位在塔楼顶上，周围建有雉堞墙，这起先给了丽贝卡希望，认为可以从这里逃跑；但是她随即发现，它不能通往其他任何雉堞墙，这只是一个孤立的小楼面或者阳台，周围照例筑有胸墙，胸墙上有射击孔，以便一些弓箭手在这里守卫塔楼，或者利用射击从侧翼保卫城堡的这一边。</p> 
<p>因此唯一的希望便是怀着坚强的意志忍受一切，学习那些视死如归的伟大人物，完全信赖上天的保佑。尽管丽贝卡对《圣经》中上帝向选民所作的许诺，接受了错误的解释，(注1)但是她认为以色列人目前正在经历一个苦难的时期，却没有错；她相信，锡安(注2)的子孙有一天也要与全体外邦人一起，被召唤到上帝面前。同时，她周围的一切也向她说明，目前他们是在接受惩罚和考验，他们的特殊任务便是忍受痛苦，避免犯罪。这样，丽贝卡早已把自己看作不幸的受难者，在这方面，她对她可能遭遇的危险，是有精神准备的。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注1)《旧约圣经》把以色列人称为上帝的选民，说上帝把过南地方许给了亚伯拉罕的子孙（见《创世记》）。但后来犹太教和基督教往往把“上帝许给的地方”解释作“乐土”或“天堂”等等。</p> 
<p>(注2)《圣经》多以锡安代表耶路撒冷，因此锡安的子孙即指以色列人。</p> 
<p>然而当楼梯上响起脚步声时，这个囚犯还是有些发抖，脸色也变了。接着小房间的门给缓缓推开，一个高大的人慢慢走了进来，随手关上了门。这人穿着给她带来这场灾难的那些强盗的衣服，戴着帽子，帽檐给拉到了眉毛上，这没了上半个脸，他的披风也裹得紧紧的，给拉起了一些，包住了其余的脸。他似乎要在这样的伪装下，干一件连他自己想起来也觉得害羞的事。然而尽管他打扮得像一个蒙面大盗，他站在惶惶不安的囚犯面前，仍显得有些局促不安，不知该怎么表达他来此的目的，这使丽贝卡有时间定下心来，推测他要说的话。她已经解下两只贵重的手镯和一根项链，现在赶紧把它们献给那个假想的暴徒，这是很自然的，她认为满足他的贪欲，便能得到宽大处理。</p> 
<p>“请你收下，朋友，”她说，“看在上帝分上，饶了我和我年迈的父亲吧！这些首饰很值钱，但只要我们能获得自由，平安无事地离开这个城堡，这些东西就算不得什么了。”</p> 
<p>“美丽的巴勒斯坦之花啊，”强盗答道，“这些珠宝光彩夺目，但没有你的牙齿洁白；这些钻石闪闪发亮，但是不能与你的眼睛相比。自从我干起这行粗野的勾当以来，我便立下了誓言，宁要美人不要财富。”</p> 
<p>“你千万别干这种健事，”丽贝卡说。“收下赎金，发发善心吧！黄金可以给你买到欢乐，践踏我们只能使你终生悔恨。我的父亲会不惜一切，满足你的最大要求；只要你采取明智的态度，我们给你的钱就足以使你恢复你在文明社会的地位——既为过去的错误获得宽恕，也为今后不再重犯创造了条件。”</p> 
<p>“你这是一厢情愿，”强盗用法语回答，因为刚才丽贝卡是用撒克逊语与他开始谈话的，可他也许觉得他不擅长使用这种语言，“巴卡谷(注)的纯洁的百合花啊！要知道，你的父亲已经落在一个法力无边的炼金术士手中，他甚至能在地牢炉子生锈的铁条上炼出金银。年高德助的以撒正在接受蒸馏器的提炼，它可以使他拥有的一切宝藏蒸发干净，我的说情和你的哀求都不起作用。你的赎金必须用爱情和美貌来支付，我不接受其他货币。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)意为“流泪谷”，在《圣经》中被用来指尘世，因为在人间充满罪孽和悲伤，典出《诗篇》第84篇。</p> 
<p>“那么你不是强盗，”丽贝卡也用他的语言回答他，“没有一个强盗会拒绝我的条件。在这片土地上，也没有一个强盗会使用你所使用的那种语言。你不是强盗，你是一个诺曼人——一个诺曼人，也许还是贵族出身。那么你的行动也应该这样，丢掉可怕的假面具，不要再横行霸道害人吧！”</p> 
<p>“你猜得一点不错，”布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔说，从脸上放下了披风，“你不是真正的以色列的女儿，要不是你年轻漂亮，你简直就是隐多珥的女巫(注)。是的，我不是强盗，沙仑的美丽的玫瑰花啊！我不是要夺取你的首饰，我是要给你的头颈和手臂戴上珠宝和钻石，因为它们应该戴上这些东西。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)《圣经》中提到的一个女巫，见《撒母耳记上》第28章。</p> 
<p>“你不要我的珠宝，那么你要我给你什么呢？”丽贝卡说。“我们之间没有任何共同之点，你是基督徒，我是犹太人。我们的结合既违背基督教会的，也违背犹太会堂的律法。”</p> 
<p>“事情确实如此，”圣殿骑士笑道。“娶一个犹太姑娘！我凭上帝的名义起誓！哪怕她是示巴女王(注1)也不成！何况你知道，锡安的美丽女儿，哪怕最虔诚的基督教国王(注2)把最虔诚的基督教女儿许给我，用朗格多克的大片土地作嫁妆，我也不能娶她。受任何女人都是违背我的誓言的，我不能有妻子，只能有情妇，我与你的关系便是这样。我是一个圣殿骑士。你瞧我身上的神圣十字架。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注1)示巴女王，《圣经》中提到的一个女王，她曾去会见以色列王所罗门，试探他的智慧，见《列王记上》第10章。</p> 
<p>(注2)指法国国王，下面的朗格多克是古代法国南方一个富饶的省份。</p> 
<p>“在眼前这样的场合，你还敢抬出它来证明你的身分？”丽贝卡说。</p> 
<p>“即使我这么做，你又何必大惊小怪，”圣殿骑士说，“你本来并不信仰我们这个得救的神圣标志。”</p> 
<p>“我的信仰来自我祖先的教导，”丽贝卡说，“如果它错了，愿上帝宽恕我！但是你，骑士先生，你的信仰是什么？你毫不犹豫地把你认为最神圣的东西抬出来作证，可是你却同时准备违背你这个骑士和教徒所作的最庄严的誓言！”</p> 
<p>“好一个伶牙俐齿的传教士，简直称得上西拉之女(注1)！”圣殿骑士答道，“但是，温柔的传道小姐，你狭隘的犹太偏见蒙住了你的眼睛，你看不到我们高贵的特权。从圣殿骑士说来，结婚是不能宽恕的罪孽；但是小小的风流韵事却无关紧要，在骑士团下一次的圣堂会议上我就可以得到赦免。你必须承认，那个最聪明的国王(注2)，还有他的父亲，都是很有说服力的例子，可是我们这些以鲜血保卫过耶路撒冷圣殿的穷苦骑士，比他们享有更大的特权。所罗门的圣殿的保卫者，是有权按照所罗门的榜样谈情说爱的。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注1)基督教传说中的一个智者名叫“西拉之子耶数”，据说基督教次经中的《便西拉智训》即他所写。</p> 
<p>(注2)指以色列的伟大国王所罗门，他以聪明著称，他的父亲即大卫王，他们都妻妾成群，《旧约》中的情歌集《雅歌》传说便是所罗门写的。</p> 
<p>“如果你读《圣经》和圣徒的传记，只是要为自己的荒淫无耻和放荡生活寻找理由，”犹太姑娘说，“那么你就是一个有罪的人，你是要从可以医病的、有益的香草中提取毒药。”</p> 
<p>圣殿骑士听到这样的指责，眼睛中冒出了怒火。“听着，丽贝卡，”他说，“我一直对你好言相劝，但是现在我得用征服者的语言踉你说话了。你是我的弓箭和长矛下的俘虏，各国的法律都规定，你必须服从我的意愿。我不会对我的权利退让一步，如果你拒绝我的规劝和要求，我便得用暴力来夺取。”</p> 
<p>“不要过来，”丽贝卡说，“不要过来，在你犯下这种不可饶恕的罪恶以前，先听我一句话！我的力气确实不如你大，因为上帝创造的女人是软弱的，得靠男人从道义上给予保护。但是我会向整个欧洲公布你的无耻行径，让所有的人都知道。我不能从你的教友那里得到同情，但我可以从他们的宗教信仰中得到帮助。你的骑士团的每个组织——每个会堂，都会听到这事，知道你像邪教徒一样，对一个犹太姑娘犯了罪。你的朋友不会为你的罪恶战栗，但是他们会认为，你追逐一个犹太民族的女儿，是玷污了你所佩戴的十字架，因而向你发出诅咒。”</p> 
<p>“你是个精明机灵的女人，”圣殿骑士答道，完全明白她讲的话是对的，他的骑士团明文规定，禁止他目前要干的这种隐私勾当，否则便将受到严厉的制裁，在某些情况下，甚至可能因而遭到贬滴。“你很厉害，”他说，“但是你要申诉，首先便得跑出这个城堡，在它的铜墙铁壁内，你的声音是传不到外面的。在这里，不论你埋怨也好，哭喊也好，抗议也好，求救也好，都只能消失在这些墙壁内。只有一个办法可以救你，丽贝卡，那就是顺从你的命运，接受我们的宗教，这样，你便可以得到荣华富贵，成为圣殿保卫者中最杰出的骑士的情妇，令许多诺曼小姐都自叹不如，羡慕不止。”</p> 
<p>“顺从我的命运！”丽贝卡说，“神圣的上帝啊，那是什么命运？接受你的宗教！那种可以庇护这么一个无赖的宗教，是什么宗教？你是圣殿骑士团中最杰出的骑士！一个怕死的骑士！一个发伪誓的骑士！我唾弃你，蔑视你。亚伯拉罕的上帝许给他的子女的东西(注)，是谁也不能剥夺的——它至少可以使她逃出这耻辱的深渊！”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)指天堂，即前面所说的上帝许给亚伯拉罕的地方。</p> 
<p>她一边说，一边推开通向塔顶平台的格子窗，转眼间便跳到了胸墙上，现在她与脚下那深不可测的地面之间已毫无遮挡。布瓦吉贝尔没有料到，她会不惜一死与他对抗，而这以前她一直站着一动不动，以致他既没有时间拦住她，也无法阻挡她。他正想走上前去，她又喊了：“站在原地别动，骄傲的圣殿骑士，不要上前！——你再跨前一步，我就从这高墙上跳下去了；我的身体会在院子的石板上跌得粉碎，但是它不会再受到你的野蛮凌辱！”</p> 
<p>讲这些话时，她握紧了双手，把它们伸向天空，好像要在她纵身下跳以前，先祈求上天保佑她的灵魂。圣殿骑士犹豫了，他那从没在怜悯或灾祸面前退缩过的决心动摇了，代之而起的是对她的刚烈性格的钦佩。“下来，”他说，“你这个性急的小妞儿！我凭天地江海起誓，我不会欺侮你。”</p> 
<p>“我不相信你，圣殿骑士，”丽贝卡说，“你已让我懂得，应该怎样看待你们这些骑士的品德。下一次圣堂会议就可以开脱你的罪责，本来嘛，这无关紧要，只是涉及一个可怜的犹太女子的荣辱罢了。”</p> 
<p>“这是你冤枉了我，”圣殿骑士急忙分辩道，“我可以用我的名字，用我胸前的十字架，用我腰里的剑，用我祖先的纹章起誓，我决不做任何伤害你的事！不要胡来，即使不为你自己，也要为你的父亲想想！我可以作他的朋友，在这个城堡中他需要一个有力的人帮助他。”</p> 
<p>“不要骗我，”丽贝卡说，“我对你太清楚了。我能够相信你吗？”</p> 
<p>“如果我做出对不起你的事，就让我的枪倒过来刺死我，让我的名字遭到万人唾骂！”布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔说。“我违反过许多法律，破坏过许多诫条，但是我从没背弃过我的诺言。”</p> 
<p>“那么我暂且相信你一次，”丽贝卡说，从胸墙上跳了下来，但依然紧靠着一个被称作下向堞眼的射击孔。“我就站在这里，”她说，“你仍待在那儿，只要你想把我们之间的距离缩短一步，你就会看到，我这个犹太女子宁可把我的灵魂托付给上帝，也不会把她的荣誉交给圣殿骑士！”</p> 
<p>丽贝卡的这些话，表现了她巍然不动的决心，这与她那张富有表情的漂亮脸蛋结合在一起，使她的容貌、神态和举止变得那么庄严，简直已超越了凡人的境界。她的目光毫不畏怯，她的两颊也没有由于面对着随时可能降临的可怕命运而发白；相反，她意识到她掌握着自己的命运，可以根据自己的意愿用死亡来摆脱耻辱，这使她的脸更显得容光焕发，也使她的眼睛格外炯炯有神。布瓦吉贝尔尽管生性傲慢，自视甚高，也不得不承认，他从没见过这么生气蓬勃、这么威严庄重的美女。</p> 
<p>“我们还是讲和吧，丽贝卡，”他说。</p> 
<p>“讲和，只要你愿意，我们可以讲和，”丽贝卡答道，“但是必须保持这个距离。”</p> 
<p>“你现在已用不到再怕我，”布瓦吉贝尔说。</p> 
<p>“我并不怕你，”她答道，“我感谢建造这个令人头晕目眩的塔楼的人，它这么高，没有一个人从这里跳下去还能活命。我感谢他，也感谢以色列的上帝！我不怕你。”</p> 
<p>“你对我并不公正，”圣殿骑士说，“我凭天地江海起誓，你对我并不公正！我不是一生下来就像你看到的这样——冷酷，自私，凶恶。是女人把我变得残忍的，因此我也要用残忍对待女人；但不是对待你这样的女人。听我说，丽贝卡。从没一个手持长枪的骑士，曾比布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔对他心爱的女子更忠诚。这女子是一个小贵族的女儿，他大肆吹嘘的领地，不过是一个败落的小城堡和一个没有收获的葡萄园，以及波尔多的一片贫瘠荒地，可是在任何举行过比武的地方，都能听到她的名字，她的名声传播得比许多拥有一个乡村作嫁妆的女子更远。是的，”他继续说，在小小的平台上踱来踱去，情绪那么激动，似乎忘记了丽贝卡的存在，“是的，那是我的功绩，我的危险，我的血汗，使蒙特迈尔的阿德兰德的名字，传遍了从卡斯蒂利亚(注)到拜占庭的宫廷。可是我得到的报答是什么？在我带着我历尽艰辛，靠流血取得的荣誉回来的时候，我却发现她已嫁给了一个加斯科尼的小地主，他的名字是在他那块微不足道的领地以外，谁也没有听到过的！我是真心爱她的。因此我对她的变心的报复也是严厉的！但是我的报复也改变了我自己。从那一天起，我割断了与生活的一切联系。我的一生必须在没有家庭生活的条件下度过，得不到亲爱的妻子的安慰。年老之后也不能享受天伦之乐。我的坟墓没有亲人凭吊，我的身后也不会留下子女，让布瓦吉贝尔这个古老的姓传下去。我向我的上级交出了自由行动的权利——独立自主的权利。圣殿骑士除了自己的姓名，一切都属于别人，既不能有领地，也不能有财产，只能按照别人的意志和愿望生活、行动和呼吸。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)卡斯蒂利亚，西班牙中部的古代王国。</p> 
<p>“哎哟！”丽贝卡说，“这样牺牲一切能换来什么呢？”</p> 
<p>“换来复仇的权力，丽贝卡，”圣殿骑士答道，“还有显赫的前程。”</p> 
<p>“这是得不偿失，”丽贝卡说，“为此牺牲人生最宝贵的自由权利，太不值得了。”</p> 
<p>“不要这么说，小姐，”圣殿骑士答道，“复仇是天神的盛宴！(注1)正如神父告诉我们的，他们之所以保留这权利，便是因为他们认为这是一种美好的享受，不应让凡人独占。至于显赫的前程！这是一种诱惑，甚至可能干扰天国的幸福。”他停了一会，然后又道，“丽贝卡！一个宁可死也不愿忍受侮辱的女人，必然拥有高傲而强大的心灵。你必须归我所有！不，不要害怕，”他又道，“这必须得到你本人的同意，并按照你的条件行事。你必须答应我，与我分享我的前途，这前途是比国王从他的王位上看到的更远大的。你回答以前先听我说，拒绝以前先好好考虑。正如你说的，圣殿骑士失去了他的社会权利，他的自主选择权，但是他成了一个强大组织的成员和细胞，在这个组织面前，哪怕国王也得发抖，因此他是像一滴雨水汇人了大海，成了不可抗拒的海洋的一部分，它可以侵蚀岩石，吞没舰队。它构成了一股汹涌澎湃、所向披靡的潮水。何况在这个强大的团体中，我不是平凡的一员，我已是它的主要指挥官之一，不久就可以登上大宗师的宝座。圣殿骑士团的贫苦战士不是仅仅要把脚踹在国王的脖子上，那是穿麻鞋的修士干的事。我们穿铁靴的脚要踏上他们的王位，我们围臂销的手要夺下他们的权杖。你们那虚无缥缈的弥赛亚(注2)的统治，不能给你们流落各地的民族带来的权力，却能靠我的野心来取得。我只是希望有一颗与我相似的心分享我的前程，我发现你就是这样一个人。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注1)这是从《圣经》中“伸冤在我，我必报应”，“耶和华是伸冤的上帝”等话引伸出来的。</p> 
<p>(注2)犹太人亡国后，相信上帝将派弥赛亚，即“复国救主”来拯救他们。后来基督教又相信耶稣就是弥赛亚，因而弥赛亚成了“救世主”。</p> 
<p>“这是对我的民族中的一个人说的吗？”丽贝卡答道。“你得想想……”</p> 
<p>“不要这么回答我，”圣殿骑士答道，“不要强调我们之间信仰的分歧；在我们的秘密会议中，我们也嘲笑这种育儿室的故事。不要以为我们会始终受到蒙蔽，相信我们的创建者的痴心妄想，他们抛弃人生的一切享乐，要作殉难的圣徒，为了保卫一片贫瘠的沙漠，一片除了从迷信的角度看毫无价值的沙漠，作无益的战斗，死在饥饿和干渴中，死在瘟疫中，死在野蛮人的刀剑下。但是我们的团体不久就采取了更大胆、更广阔的观点，为我们的牺牲找到了更好的补偿。(注)我们在欧洲的每个王国内拥有了大量的财产，我们获得了强大的军事声誉，把每个基督教国家的骑士精英纷纷吸收到了我们的组织中——这一切所要达到的目的，与我们那些虔诚的创始者的梦想是南辕北辙的；那些按照古老的原则加人我们团体的胸无大志的人，也同样懵然无知，他们的迷信只是使他们充当了我们的被动工具。但是我不想继续揭开我们的内幕了。听，号角声响了，一定发生了什么事，可能需要我到场了。我说的话请你考虑。再见！我不想为我用暴力威胁你的事请你原谅，因为要不是它，你就不会让我看到你的性格。必须靠试金石才能鉴别真金。我马上就会回来，继续与你商谈一切。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)圣殿骑士团成立于第二次十字军东征期间，起先只有几个贫苦的骑士，他们奉行西多会的严格教规，主张过清苦禁欲的生活。后来在十字军的侵略活动中，这个骑士团发了大财，所有的骑士都富埒王侯，但他们仍自称“贫苦的骑士”，这些情形在本书后半部中还会提到。</p> 
<p>他退进小房间，走下了楼梯；丽贝卡望着他的背影，想起自己竟会落进这个无法无天的暴徒手中，不禁毛骨悚然，在她看来，他那种骇人听闻的野心，简直比她刚才走投无路时面对的死亡前景更加可怕。她回到塔楼的小房间以后，首先做的便是为雅备的上帝给她提供的保护，向他谢恩，并祈求他继续保佑她和她的父亲。这时另一个名字溜进了她的祈求中，那就是那个负伤的基督徒的名字；命运使他陷入了他的死敌，一些残暴成性的歹徒的罗网中。她的心确实迟疑了一下，仿佛觉得，她竟然在与神的交谈中，会想起一个与她毫不相干的人 ——一个拿撒勒人，一个敌视她的信仰的人，这是她的信心不纯正的表现。但是名字已到了嘴边，教义上的狭隘偏见，并未能使丽贝卡收回她的话。</p>
