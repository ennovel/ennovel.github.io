<p>The Prior Aymer had taken the opportunity afforded him, of changing his riding robe for one of yet more costly materials, over which he wore a cope curiously embroidered. Besides the massive golden signet ring, which marked his ecclesiastical dignity, his fingers, though contrary to the canon, were loaded with precious gems; his sandals were of the finest leather which was imported from Spain; his beard trimmed to as small dimensions as his order would possibly permit, and his shaven crown concealed by a scarlet cap richly embroidered.</p> 
<p>The appearance of the Knight Templar was also changed; and, though less studiously bedecked with ornament, his dress was as rich, and his appearance far more commanding, than that of his companion. He had exchanged his shirt of mail for an under tunic of dark purple silk, garnished with furs, over which flowed his long robe of spotless white, in ample folds. The eight-pointed cross of his order was cut on the shoulder of his mantle in black velvet. The high cap no longer invested his brows, which were only shaded by short and thick curled hair of a raven blackness, corresponding to his unusually swart complexion. Nothing could be more gracefully majestic than his step and manner, had they not been marked by a predominant air of haughtiness, easily acquired by the exercise of unresisted authority.</p> 
<p>These two dignified persons were followed by their respective attendants, and at a more humble distance by their guide, whose figure had nothing more remarkable than it derived from the usual weeds of a pilgrim. A cloak or mantle of coarse black serge, enveloped his whole body. It was in shape something like the cloak of a modern hussar, having similar flaps for covering the arms, and was called a "Sclaveyn", or "Sclavonian". Coarse sandals, bound with thongs, on his bare feet; a broad and shadowy hat, with cockle-shells stitched on its brim, and a long staff shod with iron, to the upper end of which was attached a branch of palm, completed the palmer's attire. He followed modestly the last of the train which entered the hall, and, observing that the lower table scarce afforded room sufficient for the domestics of Cedric and the retinue of his guests, he withdrew to a settle placed beside and almost under one of the large chimneys, and seemed to employ himself in drying his garments, until the retreat of some one should make room at the board, or the hospitality of the steward should supply him with refreshments in the place he had chosen apart.</p> 
<p>Cedric rose to receive his guests with an air of dignified hospitality, and, descending from the dais, or elevated part of his hall, made three steps towards them, and then awaited their approach.</p> 
<p>"I grieve," he said, "reverend Prior, that my vow binds me to advance no farther upon this floor of my fathers, even to receive such guests as you, and this valiant Knight of the Holy Temple. But my steward has expounded to you the cause of my seeming discourtesy. Let me also pray, that you will excuse my speaking to you in my native language, and that you will reply in the same if your knowledge of it permits; if not, I sufficiently understand Norman to follow your meaning."</p> 
<p>"Vows," said the Abbot, "must be unloosed, worthy Franklin, or permit me rather to say, worthy Thane, though the title is antiquated. Vows are the knots which tie us to Heaven---they are the cords which bind the sacrifice to the horns of the altar, ---and are therefore,---as I said before,---to be unloosened and discharged, unless our holy Mother Church shall pronounce the contrary. And respecting language, I willingly hold communication in that spoken by my respected grandmother, Hilda of Middleham, who died in odour of sanctity, little short, if we may presume to say so, of her glorious namesake, the blessed Saint Hilda of Whitby, God be gracious to her soul!"</p> 
<p>When the Prior had ceased what he meant as a conciliatory harangue, his companion said briefly and emphatically, "I speak ever French, the language of King Richard and his nobles; but I understand English sufficiently to communicate with the natives of the country."</p> 
<p>Cedric darted at the speaker one of those hasty and impatient glances, which comparisons between the two rival nations seldom failed to call forth; but, recollecting the duties of hospitality, he suppressed further show of resentment, and, motioning with his hand, caused his guests to assume two seats a little lower than his own, but placed close beside him, and gave a signal that the evening meal should be placed upon the board.</p> 
<p>While the attendants hastened to obey Cedric's commands, his eye distinguished Gurth the swineherd, who, with his companion Wamba, had just entered the hall. "Send these loitering knaves up hither," said the Saxon, impatiently. And when the culprits came before the dais,---"How comes it, villains! that you have loitered abroad so late as this? Hast thou brought home thy charge, sirrah Gurth, or hast thou left them to robbers and marauders?"</p> 
<p>"The herd is safe, so please ye," said Gurth.</p> 
<p>"But it does not please me, thou knave," said Cedric, "that I should be made to suppose otherwise for two hours, and sit here devising vengeance against my neighbours for wrongs they have not done me. I tell thee, shackles and the prison-house shall punish the next offence of this kind."</p> 
<p>Gurth, knowing his master's irritable temper, attempted no exculpation; but the Jester, who could presume upon Cedric's tolerance, by virtue of his privileges as a fool, replied for them both; "In troth, uncle Cedric, you are neither wise nor reasonable to-night."</p> 
<p>"'How, sir?" said his master; "you shall to the porter's lodge, and taste of the discipline there, if you give your foolery such license."</p> 
<p>"First let your wisdom tell me," said Wamba, "is it just and reasonable to punish one person for the fault of another?"</p> 
<p>"Certainly not, fool," answered Cedric.</p> 
<p>"Then why should you shackle poor Gurth, uncle, for the fault of his dog Fangs? for I dare be sworn we lost not a minute by the way, when we had got our herd together, which Fangs did not manage until we heard the vesper-bell."</p> 
<p>"Then hang up Fangs," said Cedric, turning hastily towards the swineherd, "if the fault is his, and get thee another dog."</p> 
<p>"Under favour, uncle," said the Jester, "that were still somewhat on the bow-hand of fair justice; for it was no fault of Fangs that he was lame and could not gather the herd, but the fault of those that struck off two of his fore-claws, an operation for which, if the poor fellow had been consulted, he would scarce have given his voice."</p> 
<p>"And who dared to lame an animal which belonged to my bondsman?" said the Saxon, kindling in wrath.</p> 
<p>"Marry, that did old Hubert," said Wamba, "Sir Philip de Malvoisin's keeper of the chase. He caught Fangs strolling in the forest, and said he chased the deer contrary to his master's right, as warden of the walk."</p> 
<p>"The foul fiend take Malvoisin," answered the Saxon, "and his keeper both! I will teach them that the wood was disforested in terms of the great Forest Charter. But enough of this. Go to, knave, go to thy place---and thou, Gurth, get thee another dog, and should the keeper dare to touch it, I will mar his archery; the curse of a coward on my head, if I strike not off the forefinger of his right hand!---he shall draw bowstring no more. ---I crave your pardon, my worthy guests. I am beset here with neighbours that match your infidels, Sir Knight, in Holy Land. But your homely fare is before you; feed, and let welcome make amends for hard fare."</p> 
<p>The feast, however, which was spread upon the board, needed no apologies from the lord of the mansion. Swine's flesh, dressed in several modes, appeared on the lower part of the board, as also that of fowls, deer, goats, and hares, and various kinds of fish, together with huge loaves and cakes of bread, and sundry confections made of fruits and honey. The smaller sorts of wild-fowl, of which there was abundance, were not served up in platters, but brought in upon small wooden spits or broaches, and offered by the pages and domestics who bore them, to each guest in succession, who cut from them such a portion as he pleased. Beside each person of rank was placed a goblet of silver; the lower board was accommodated with large drinking horns.</p> 
<p>When the repast was about to commence, the major-domo, or steward, suddenly raising his wand, said aloud,---"Forbear! ---Place for the Lady Rowena."</p> 
<p>A side-door at the upper end of the hall now opened behind the banquet table, and Rowena, followed by four female attendants, entered the apartment. Cedric, though surprised, and perhaps not altogether agreeably so, at his ward appearing in public on this occasion, hastened to meet her, and to conduct her, with respectful ceremony, to the elevated seat at his own right hand, appropriated to the lady of the mansion. All stood up to receive her; and, replying to their courtesy by a mute gesture of salutation, she moved gracefully forward to assume her place at the board. Ere she had time to do so, the Templar whispered to the Prior, "I shall wear no collar of gold of yours at the tournament. The Chian wine is your own."</p> 
<p>"Said I not so?" answered the Prior; "but check your raptures, the Franklin observes you."</p> 
<p>Unheeding this remonstrance, and accustomed only to act upon the immediate impulse of his own wishes, Brian de Bois-Guilbert kept his eyes riveted on the Saxon beauty, more striking perhaps to his imagination, because differing widely from those of the Eastern sultanas.</p> 
<p>Formed in the best proportions of her sex, Rowena was tall in stature, yet not so much so as to attract observation on account of superior height. Her complexion was exquisitely fair, but the noble cast of her head and features prevented the insipidity which sometimes attaches to fair beauties. Her clear blue eye, which sat enshrined beneath a graceful eyebrow of brown sufficiently marked to give expression to the forehead, seemed capable to kindle as well as melt, to command as well as to beseech. If mildness were the more natural expression of such a combination of features, it was plain, that in the present instance, the exercise of habitual superiority, and the reception of general homage, had given to the Saxon lady a loftier character, which mingled with and qualified that bestowed by nature. Her profuse hair, of a colour betwixt brown and flaxen, was arranged in a fanciful and graceful manner in numerous ringlets, to form which art had probably aided nature. These locks were braided with gems, and, being worn at full length, intimated the noble birth and free-born condition of the maiden. A golden chain, to which was attached a small reliquary of the same metal, hung round her neck. She wore bracelets on her arms, which were bare. Her dress was an under-gown and kirtle of pale sea-green silk, over which hung a long loose robe, which reached to the ground, having very wide sleeves, which came down, however, very little below the elbow. This robe was crimson, and manufactured out of the very finest wool. A veil of silk, interwoven with gold, was attached to the upper part of it, which could be, at the wearer's pleasure, either drawn over the face and bosom after the Spanish fashion, or disposed as a sort of drapery round the shoulders.</p> 
<p>When Rowena perceived the Knight Templar's eyes bent on her with an ardour, that, compared with the dark caverns under which they moved, gave them the effect of lighted charcoal, she drew with dignity the veil around her face, as an intimation that the determined freedom of his glance was disagreeable. Cedric saw the motion and its cause. "Sir Templar," said he, "the cheeks of our Saxon maidens have seen too little of the sun to enable them to bear the fixed glance of a crusader."</p> 
<p>"If I have offended," replied Sir Brian, "I crave your pardon, --that is, I crave the Lady Rowena's pardon,---for my humility will carry me no lower."</p> 
<p>"The Lady Rowena," said the Prior, "has punished us all, in chastising the boldness of my friend. Let me hope she will be less cruel to the splendid train which are to meet at the tournament."</p> 
<p>"Our going thither," said Cedric, "is uncertain. I love not these vanities, which were unknown to my fathers when England was free."</p> 
<p>"Let us hope, nevertheless," said the Prior, "our company may determine you to travel thitherward; when the roads are so unsafe, the escort of Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert is not to be despised."</p> 
<p>"Sir Prior," answered the Saxon, "wheresoever I have travelled in this land, I have hitherto found myself, with the assistance of my good sword and faithful followers, in no respect needful of other aid. At present, if we indeed journey to Ashby-de-la-Zouche, we do so with my noble neighbour and countryman Athelstane of Coningsburgh, and with such a train as would set outlaws and feudal enemies at defiance.---I drink to you, Sir Prior, in this cup of wine, which I trust your taste will approve, and I thank you for your courtesy. Should you be so rigid in adhering to monastic rule," he added, "as to prefer your acid preparation of milk, I hope you will not strain courtesy to do me reason."</p> 
<p>"Nay," said the Priest, laughing, "it is only in our abbey that we confine ourselves to the 'lac dulce' or the 'lac acidum' either. Conversing with, the world, we use the world's fashions, and therefore I answer your pledge in this honest wine, and leave the weaker liquor to my lay-brother."</p> 
<p>"And I," said the Templar, filling his goblet, "drink wassail to the fair Rowena; for since her namesake introduced the word into England, has never been one more worthy of such a tribute. By my faith, I could pardon the unhappy Vortigern, had he half the cause that we now witness, for making shipwreck of his honour and his kingdom."</p> 
<p>"I will spare your courtesy, Sir Knight," said Rowena with dignity, and without unveiling herself; "or rather I will tax it so far as to require of you the latest news from Palestine, a theme more agreeable to our English ears than the compliments which your French breeding teaches."</p> 
<p>"I have little of importance to say, lady," answered Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, "excepting the confirmed tidings of a truce with Saladin."</p> 
<p>He was interrupted by Wamba, who had taken his appropriated seat upon a chair, the back of which was decorated with two ass's ears, and which was placed about two steps behind that of his master, who, from time to time, supplied him with victuals from his own trencher; a favour, however, which the Jester shared with the favourite dogs, of whom, as we have already noticed, there were several in attendance. Here sat Wamba, with a small table before him, his heels tucked up against the bar of the chair, his cheeks sucked up so as to make his jaws resemble a pair of nut-crackers, and his eyes half-shut, yet watching with alertness every opportunity to exercise his licensed foolery.</p> 
<p>"These truces with the infidels," he exclaimed, without caring how suddenly he interrupted the stately Templar, "make an old man of me!"</p> 
<p>"Go to, knave, how so?" said Cedric, his features prepared to receive favourably the expected jest.</p> 
<p>"Because," answered Wamba, "I remember three of them in my day, each of which was to endure for the course of fifty years; so that, by computation, I must be at least a hundred and fifty years old."</p> 
<p>"I will warrant you against dying of old age, however," said the Templar, who now recognised his friend of the forest; "I will assure you from all deaths but a violent one, if you give such directions to wayfarers, as you did this night to the Prior and me."</p> 
<p>"How, sirrah!" said Cedric, "misdirect travellers? We must have you whipt; you are at least as much rogue as fool."</p> 
<p>"I pray thee, uncle," answered the Jester, "let my folly, for once, protect my roguery. I did but make a mistake between my right hand and my left; and he might have pardoned a greater, who took a fool for his counsellor and guide."</p> 
<p>Conversation was here interrupted by the entrance of the porter's page, who announced that there was a stranger at the gate, imploring admittance and hospitality,</p> 
<p>"Admit him," said Cedric, "be he who or what he may;---a night like that which roars without, compels even wild animals to herd with tame, and to seek the protection of man, their mortal foe, rather than perish by the elements. Let his wants be ministered to with all care---look to it, Oswald."</p> 
<p>And the steward left the banqueting hall to see the commands of his patron obeyed.</p>

<p>一个更不体面的座位……</p> 
<p>《奥德赛》第二十卷</p> 
<p>艾默长老已利用休息的机会，脱下了骑马穿的斗篷，换了一件衣料更贵重的长袍，外面罩了绣花精致的披风。手指上除了标明他在教会中的尊贵身份的图章金指环以外，他还不顾教规，戴了好几只宝石戒指；他的鞋子是用西班牙输入的最细的皮革做的；他的胡须按照他的修会所允许的程度，修剪得小巧玲戏；他那薙发的头顶则藏在绣满精致花纹的红色小帽下。</p> 
<p>圣殿骑士的装束也换过了，他虽然没戴那么多珠宝，但衣服同样豪华，外表也比他的同伴神气得多。他的锁子甲上衣换成了镶皮毛的深紫色绸短袄，外面罩一件纯白色大褶裥长袍。长袍肩上仍用黑丝绒镶着他的骑士团的八角十字架。但那顶高帽子不再压在他的眉毛上，帽檐下露出了一圈又短又浓的鬈发，这些乌油油的墨黑头发，与他晒得黑不溜秋的皮肤显得很相称。他的举止神态也许本来算得上风度翩翩、英俊威武，可惜由于手握不可抗柜的权力，他养成了骄横跋扈的作风，以致这成了他压倒一切的特征。</p> 
<p>这两个贵人后面跟着他们各自的随从，稍远一些则是保持着谦恭距离的他们的向导；这个人除了朝圣者的一般装束，没有任何引人注目的地方。一件粗呢黑外套或大氅裹住了他的全身，它的式样有些像现代轻骑兵的所谓斯拉夫式披风，肩上也有两片翼子遮盖着手臂。他光着脚，粗糙的鞋子用皮带绑在脚上；阔边的帽子给脸部投下了一层阴影，帽边上缝着一排海扇壳；他拄着一根长长的手杖，它底部包了铁，顶端缚着一枝棕榈叶——这便是朝圣者的全部眼饰(注)。他小心翼翼地跟在这队人后面，走进了大厅，发现下面那张餐桌已挤满了塞德里克的仆人和宾客们的随从，于是退到旁边一张长凳上坐下，长凳紧靠大壁炉，几乎就在它下面；他似乎在烤干衣服，一边等待别人退席，餐桌出现空位子，或者管家出于好心，给他选择的边座另外送些食物。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)这里的朝圣者是专指上圣地耶路撒冷朝拜的基督徒。海扇壳被他们看作圣物，在上面画了圣母马利亚和耶稣等图像，作为护身符系在帽上。朝圣者离开圣地时得携带一支祝圣过的棕榈叶，把它带回本国，放在自己的教区教堂的祭台上。</p> 
<p>塞德里克站起身来，露出殷勤待客的庄严神态，从他那块高出地面的土坛上下来，朝前走了三步，然后站在那里，等待客人们过来。</p> 
<p>“很对不起，”他说，“尊敬的院长，我的誓言束缚了我，在我祖先的这块地方，我不能再向前走了，尽管我要迎接的是您和这位勇敢的圣殿骑士那样的客人。但是我的管家已向您说明了我这种貌似不恭敬的行为的原因。还有，我希望您能原谅我用我的本族语言与您谈话，如果您懂得它，请您也用这种语言回答我；如果不，我对诺曼语也有所了解，可以明白您的意思。”</p> 
<p>“誓言是不能违背的，”院长答道，“可敬的庄园主先生，或者不如说，可敬的乡绅先生，虽然这称呼已太古老了。誓言是把我们与天国联系在一起的纽带——一种把祭品拴在祭台上的绳子，因此正如我以前所说，它是不能解开的，不能违背的，除非我们神圣的教会作出相反的决定。至于语言，我很乐于听到我尊敬的祖母希尔达·米德尔海姆使用过的语言，她是带着圣洁的灵魂去世的，也许我可以不揣冒昧地说，她与她那位光辉的同名者惠特比的圣希尔达(注)只是稍差一筹而已——愿上帝保佑她的在天之灵！”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)惠特比的希尔达（614—680），英国的基督教女教士，曾创建惠特比修道院等，死后被尊为圣徒。</p> 
<p>长老讲完了这一番意在调和气氛的高论之后，他的同伴也简单扼要地说道：“我一向讲法语，这是理查王和他的贵族的语言；但是我懂得英语，可以跟这个国家的本地人互相交谈。”</p> 
<p>塞德里克向讲话人发出了急遽而厌烦的一瞥，这是他每逢听到把两个敌对民族作比较时，往往会有的表现；但是想到作为主人的责任，他克制了怒气的进一步发展，摆了摆手，请他的客人在两把比他的座位略低，然而紧挨着他的椅子上坐下，然后做了个手势，表示晚餐可以端上桌子了。</p> 
<p>仆人们为执行他的命令匆匆走了，这时他的眼睛发现了放猎人葛四，后者正与他的伙伴汪八走进大厅。“叫这些游荡的混蛋马上来见我，”撒克逊人不耐烦地说。两个罪犯来到了土台前面，他又道：“混蛋，你们在外面闲逛，到这个时候才回家，是怎么回事？葛四这小子，你的牲口呢，赶回家了，还是送给强盗和土匪了？”</p> 
<p>“牲口安好无损，您老可以放心，”葛回答道。</p> 
<p>“你这小子，说得倒好，叫我放心，我怎么放心得了，”塞德里克说道。“我已经担心了两个钟头，尽在琢磨，怎么跟那些邻居算帐，谁知他们并没干什么。好吧，告诉你，下次再发生这种事，非把你套上脚镣、关进地牢不可。”</p> 
<p>葛四了解主人的急躁脾气，不想声辩；但是汪八自恃享有小丑的特权，塞德里克对他的话从不计较，因此替他们两人答道：“不过，塞德里克老爷子，您今儿晚上可不够高明，头脑有些糊涂了。”</p> 
<p>“怎么，先生！”主人道，“要是你以为凭你几句笑话，便可以肆无忌惮，我就得把你关进门房间，让你尝尝禁闭的滋味。”</p> 
<p>“那么我先请教您老一个问题，”汪八说，“一个人做了错事，却处罚另一个人，这是不是公平？”</p> 
<p>“当然不，傻瓜，”塞德里克答道。</p> 
<p>“那么，老爷子，您为什么要可怜的葛四，为他的狗方斯的错误戴脚镣？因为我可以起誓，我们没在路上玩儿一分钟，只是为了把猪赶到一起，方斯磨磨蹭蹭的，直到晚祷的钟声响了，才把这事办好。”</p> 
<p>“既然方斯不对，那就把方斯吊死，”塞德里克说，随即扭过头去，对放猪人道，“你可以另外找条狗。”</p> 
<p>“对不起，老爷子，”小丑说道，“您的处罚还是没有打中要害；因为这也不能怪方斯，它的腿瘸了，没法把猪赶到一起，这是那些割断了它两只前爪的家伙作的孽，要是动这个手术以前，先跟可怜的方斯商量一下，我想它是肯定不会同意的。”</p> 
<p>“我的仆人的狗，谁敢割断它的前爪？”撒克逊人勃然大怒，说道。</p> 
<p>“告诉您，那是菲利普·马尔沃辛的猎场管理人老体伯特干的好事，”汪人说。“方斯走过他的森林，他便摆出护林人的架势，说方斯想捕捉鹿，侵犯他的主人的利益。”</p> 
<p>“该死的马尔沃辛，”撒克逊人答道，“还有那个护林人，统统该死！我得让他们明白，按照森林宪章的规定，这一带树林已不属于禁猎范围(注)。但这事不必再谈了。去吧，小子，干你的事去；还有你，葛四，你另外挑只狗，要是那个管林人再敢碰它一下，他就甭想再挽弓了；我不打断他右手的食指，我就是个胆小鬼！我要让他永远拉不了弓，射不了箭。请两位原谅，尊贵的客人，我这儿一些邻舍简直不讲道理，骑士先生，跟您在圣地遇到的异教徒差不多。但是现在，简陋的食物已摆上桌子，请用吧，酒菜固然粗劣，我们的心意是真诚的。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)参见作者附注一。</p> 
<p>话虽这么说，桌上的食物还是应有尽有，主人的歉意是多余的。在餐桌的下端放着用各种方式烹调的猪肉，还有家禽、鹿肉、山羊和兔子，各种鱼，以及大片的面包和大块的糕饼，水果和蜜糖做的各色甜点。较小的野味也十分丰盛，它们不是放在盘子里，而是插在小木棍或铁叉上，由小厮和仆人接连不断送到客人面前，让客人自行割取的。每个有身份的人面前都放着一只银高脚酒杯，下面的餐桌上用的则是角制大酒杯。</p> 
<p>正当就餐即将开始时，管家或膳食总管突然举起权杖，朗声说道：“且慢！罗文娜小姐驾到。”大厅上首，筵席背后的一扇边门随即打开了，罗文娜走进了屋子，后面跟着四个使女。塞德里克虽有些诧异，或许对他的义女抛头露面出现在这个场合，也有些不以为然，但仍赶紧起立迎候，彬彬有礼地把她领到他右边那把较高的椅子那儿，这是女主人的专座。大家全都站了起来迎接她，她一边默默颔首，向他们答礼，一边雍容大方地走到桌边就坐。早在她坐下以前，圣殿骑士已凑在长者耳边说道；“我不会在比武会上戴你的金项圈了。那些希俄斯酒已归你所有。”</p> 
<p>“我不说过了吗？”长老答道。“但是不要神魂颠倒，我们的主人在瞧着你呢。”</p> 
<p>然而布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔一向随心所欲，不知顾忌，拿院长的警告当耳边风，依然把眼睛死死盯在撒克逊美女身上；也许正因为她与苏丹的姬妾差别太大了，这才使他特别心醉神迷。</p> 
<p>罗文娜体态优美，一切都恰到好处；她身材颀长，显得亭亭玉立，但又不是高得过分，以致引人注目。她的皮肤细腻洁白，然而高贵的脸型和容貌，却防止了一般美女有时出现的呆板乏味的神色。弯弯的深褐色眉毛，把她的前额衬托得格外动人，那对清澈的蓝眼睛隐藏在眉毛下，似乎既热烈又温和，既威严又亲切。如果温厚平和是这种面容的天然表情，那么很清楚，从目前看来，她的优越地位养成的习惯，她一贯受到尊敬的身份，都赋予了这位撒克逊少女一种更崇高的气质，它与自然所给予她的特点结合在一起，冲淡了后者的表现。她的浓密头发介于棕色和金黄色之间，以各种优美动人的方式，分散成无数条一绺绺的鬈发，在这方面人力也许给自然帮了些忙。这些鬈发上点缀着宝石首饰，长长的垂挂下来，让人看到这是一个名门出身，又生来自由自在的少女。一串金项链围在她的脖子上，项链下挂了一只也是金质的小圣物盒。她露出的手臂上戴着镯子，身上穿着浅绿色绸小袄和裙子，外面罩了一件宽松的长大褂，几乎拖到地上，袖子也非常大，然而只达到臂弯那儿。大褂颜色深红，是用非常精美的毛料制作的。一块镶金线的丝面纱披到了罩袍的上半身，戴的人可以任意调整，既可以像酉班牙人那样把它遮在脸上和胸前，也可以把它当作围巾披在肩上。</p> 
<p>罗文娜发觉圣殿骑士的眼睛正盯着她瞧，它们露出炽烈的情欲，仿佛躲在黑暗的山洞中向外窥探，这使那对眼睛变得像燃烧的火炭那么亮亮的，于是她庄严地用面纱遮住了脸，似乎在警告他，他那种放肆的目光是不受欢迎的。</p> 
<p>塞德里克看到了这动作和它的原因，说道：“骑士阁下，我们撒克逊姑娘的脸皮没有经过风吹日晒，是受不了十字军武士的注视的。”</p> 
<p>“如果我有冒犯之处，”布里恩爵士答道，“请多多原谅——我是说，请罗文娜小姐原谅，因为我的歉意只能到此为止。”</p> 
<p>“罗文娜小姐谴责我的朋友的大胆表现，也是对我们两人的惩罚，’旧老说。“但愿她在比武大会上，对那些光彩夺目的武士们不致这么残忍才好。”</p> 
<p>“我们去不去那儿还没一定，”塞德里克说。“我不喜欢这种繁华的场面，在英国还是自由国家的时候，我们的祖先是不欣赏这类事的。”</p> 
<p>“不过我们希望，”长老说，“我们的作伴能使您拿定主意，上那儿去走走；现在路上很不太平，布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔爵士的护送还是不可少的。”</p> 
<p>“院长阁下，”撒克逊人答道，“在这片土地上，不论我要上哪儿，在我的利剑和忠诚的随从的帮助下，我一直觉得自己很安全，不需要别人的保护。至于目前，如果我们当真要去阿什贝镇，我们会跟我高贵的邻居和同胞科宁斯堡的阿特尔斯坦同行，我们的随行人员便足以保证我们不必担心强人和仇敌的骚扰。院长阁下，我感谢您的关心，敬您这杯酒，我相信它会合您的口味。不过如果您为了严格遵守修院的戒律，”他又道，“只喝酸奶制品，那么您也不必为了礼节，过分勉强。”</p> 
<p>“不，”长老笑道，“我们只在修道院内才用甜奶或酸奶代替酒。在与世人交往时，我们便按照世俗的方式行事，因此我可以用真正的酒与您互相祝贺，把清淡的饮料留给教友兄弟们。”</p> 
<p>“我也得为美丽的罗文娜干一杯，向她表示敬意，”圣殿骑士说，一边往自己的酒杯里斟酒，“因为自从她的同名者(注1)把这名字引进英国以来，还没有一位小姐更有资格得到美丽这样的称赞。我担保我能原谅不幸的沃尔蒂格恩(注2)，只要他爱的美人有我们见到的这位一半那么美，他为她牺牲自己的荣誉和江山就是值得的。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注1)指最早到达不列颠的盎格鲁-撒克逊人的领袖亨吉斯特的女儿罗文娜。</p> 
<p>(注2)沃尔蒂格恩，传说中的公元五世纪时不列颠人的国王，他为了抵抗皮克特人和苏格兰人，与刚进入不列颠的亨吉斯特联姻，娶了他的女儿罗文娜，但后来撒克逊人拒绝离开，占领了不列颠。</p> 
<p>“我可不敢接受您的恭维，骑士阁下，”罗文娜庄重地回答，没有揭开她的面纱，“我倒是宁可听听，您从巴勒斯坦带回来的最新消息，这对我们英国人说来，比您的法国式教养所擅长的赞美更加动听。”</p> 
<p>“我没有什么重要消息可以奉告，小姐，”布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔爵士答道，“只能说，我们与萨拉丁(注)同意暂时停战了。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)萨拉丁，中世纪埃及和巴勒斯坦等的苏丹，1171—1193年在位。他是第三次十字军的主要对手，由于萨拉丁的强大，这次十字军没有取得任何成果，只得于1192年与萨拉丁缔结和约，暂时停战。</p> 
<p>他的话给汪八打断了，后者这时正坐在他专用的、椅背上饰有两只驴耳的椅子上，它位在主人后面，大约两步远的地方，主人不时从自己的盘子里挑一些食物给他，让这位滑稽人可以与那些得宠的狗享受同等的优惠待遇——我们已经说过，有好几只狗待在那里，享有这种待遇。汪八面前是一张小桌子，他坐在椅上只得把脚跟抬起，抵住椅子的横档。他缩紧了腮帮子，使他的嘴巴变得像一把轧胡桃的小钳子；他的眼睛半睁半闭，然而仍密切注意着每一个可供他插科打浑行使特权的机会。</p> 
<p>“谈到这种跟邪教徒的停战，”他不顾神气活现的圣殿骑士正在讲话，突然嚷了起来，“我便觉得自己一下子变成了老头子！”</p> 
<p>“胡说什么，小混蛋，怎么会这样？”塞德里克说，不过他的神色倒好像准备听一段笑话似的。</p> 
<p>“因为我记得，”汪八答道，“我这一辈子已听到过三次这样的停战，假定每次可以维持五十年，那么按照正规的计算方法，我至少该有一百五十岁了。”</p> 
<p>“不过我保证你不会活到那么老才死，”圣殿骑士说，他现在认出这位森林朋友了。“你要担心的不是其他死法，倒是给人揍死，因为如果你老像今晚给长老和我指路那样，给赶路的人胡乱指点方向，你的下场便是这样。”</p> 
<p>“怎么，老兄！”塞德里克说，“给行人胡乱指点方向？我得打你一顿才成；你不仅是个傻子，至少也是个骗子。”</p> 
<p>“请你听我说，老爷子，”小丑答道，“我的欺骗只是我的愚昧造成的，我把左当成了右，右当成了左；可是他却把傻子当作聪明人，向他问路，这是更大的错误。”</p> 
<p>谈话这时给打断了，门房间的小厮来报告，外面来了个陌生人，要求在庄上借宿一宵，吃些东西。</p> 
<p>“放他进来，”塞德里克说，“不管他是谁，是干什么的；在这种风雨交加的夜晚，哪怕野兽也得寻找藏身之处，人虽然是它们不共戴天的仇敌，为了不致死在荒野中，它们也会向人乞求保护。我们可以满足他的一切需要，奥斯瓦尔德，你去料理这事。”</p> 
<p>管家离开宴会大厅，为执行主人的命令作安排去了。</p>
