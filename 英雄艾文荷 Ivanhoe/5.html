Thomson's Liberty</p> 
<p>In a hall, the height of which was greatly disproportioned to its extreme length and width, a long oaken table, formed of planks rough-hewn from the forest, and which had scarcely received any polish, stood ready prepared for the evening meal of Cedric the Saxon. The roof, composed of beams and rafters, had nothing to divide the apartment from the sky excepting the planking and thatch; there was a huge fireplace at either end of the hall, but as the chimneys were constructed in a very clumsy manner, at least as much of the smoke found its way into the apartment as escaped by the proper vent. The constant vapour which this occasioned, had polished the rafters and beams of the low-browed hall, by encrusting them with a black varnish of soot. On the sides of the apartment hung implements of war and of the chase, and there were at each corner folding doors, which gave access to other parts of the extensive building.</p> 
<p>The other appointments of the mansion partook of the rude simplicity of the Saxon period, which Cedric piqued himself upon maintaining. The floor was composed of earth mixed with lime, trodden into a hard substance, such as is often employed in flooring our modern barns. For about one quarter of the length of the apartment, the floor was raised by a step, and this space, which was called the dais, was occupied only by the principal members of the family, and visitors of distinction. For this purpose, a table richly covered with scarlet cloth was placed transversely across the platform, from the middle of which ran the longer and lower board, at which the domestics and inferior persons fed, down towards the bottom of the hall. The whole resembled the form of the letter T, or some of those ancient dinner-tables, which, arranged on the same principles, may be still seen in the antique Colleges of Oxford or Cambridge. Massive chairs and settles of carved oak were placed upon the dais, and over these seats and the more elevated table was fastened a canopy of cloth, which served in some degree to protect the dignitaries who occupied that distinguished station from the weather, and especially from the rain, which in some places found its way through the ill-constructed roof.</p> 
<p>The walls of this upper end of the hall, as far as the dais extended, were covered with hangings or curtains, and upon the floor there was a carpet, both of which were adorned with some attempts at tapestry, or embroidery, executed with brilliant or rather gaudy colouring. Over the lower range of table, the roof, as we have noticed, had no covering; the rough plastered walls were left bare, and the rude earthen floor was uncarpeted; the board was uncovered by a cloth, and rude massive benches supplied the place of chairs.</p> 
<p>In the centre of the upper table, were placed two chairs more elevated than the rest, for the master and mistress of the family, who presided over the scene of hospitality, and from doing so derived their Saxon title of honour, which signifies "the Dividers of Bread."</p> 
<p>To each of these chairs was added a footstool, curiously carved and inlaid with ivory, which mark of distinction was peculiar to them. One of these seats was at present occupied by Cedric the Saxon, who, though but in rank a thane, or, as the Normans called him, a Franklin, felt, at the delay of his evening meal, an irritable impatience, which might have become an alderman, whether of ancient or of modern times.</p> 
<p>It appeared, indeed, from the countenance of this proprietor, that he was of a frank, but hasty and choleric temper. He was not above the middle stature, but broad-shouldered, long-armed, and powerfully made, like one accustomed to endure the fatigue of war or of the chase; his face was broad, with large blue eyes, open and frank features, fine teeth, and a well formed head, altogether expressive of that sort of good-humour which often lodges with a sudden and hasty temper. Pride and jealousy there was in his eye, for his life had been spent in asserting rights which were constantly liable to invasion; and the prompt, fiery, and resolute disposition of the man, had been kept constantly upon the alert by the circumstances of his situation. His long yellow hair was equally divided on the top of his head and upon his brow, and combed down on each side to the length of his shoulders; it had but little tendency to grey, although Cedric was approaching to his sixtieth year.</p> 
<p>His dress was a tunic of forest green, furred at the throat and cuffs with what was called minever; a kind of fur inferior in quality to ermine, and formed, it is believed, of the skin of the grey squirrel. This doublet hung unbuttoned over a close dress of scarlet which sat tight to his body; he had breeches of the same, but they did not reach below the lower part of the thigh, leaving the knee exposed. His feet had sandals of the same fashion with the peasants, but of finer materials, and secured in the front with golden clasps. He had bracelets of gold upon his arms, and a broad collar of the same precious metal around his neck. About his waist he wore a richly-studded belt, in which was stuck a short straight two-edged sword, with a sharp point, so disposed as to hang almost perpendicularly by his side. Behind his seat was hung a scarlet cloth cloak lined with fur, and a cap of the same materials richly embroidered, which completed the dress of the opulent landholder when he chose to go forth. A short boar-spear, with a broad and bright steel head, also reclined against the back of his chair, which served him, when he walked abroad, for the purposes of a staff or of a weapon, as chance might require.</p> 
<p>Several domestics, whose dress held various proportions betwixt the richness of their master's, and the coarse and simple attire of Gurth the swine-herd, watched the looks and waited the commands of the Saxon dignitary. Two or three servants of a superior order stood behind their master upon the dais; the rest occupied the lower part of the hall. Other attendants there were of a different description; two or three large and shaggy greyhounds, such as were then employed in hunting the stag and wolf; as many slow-hounds of a large bony breed, with thick necks, large heads, and long ears; and one or two of the smaller dogs, now called terriers, which waited with impatience the arrival of the supper; but, with the sagacious knowledge of physiognomy peculiar to their race, forbore to intrude upon the moody silence of their master, apprehensive probably of a small white truncheon which lay by Cedric's trencher, for the purpose of repelling the advances of his four-legged dependants. One grisly old wolf-dog alone, with the liberty of an indulged favourite, had planted himself close by the chair of state, and occasionally ventured to solicit notice by putting his large hairy head upon his master's knee, or pushing his nose into his hand. Even he was repelled by the stern command, "Down, Balder, down! I am not in the humour for foolery."</p> 
<p>In fact, Cedric, as we have observed, was in no very placid state of mind. The Lady Rowena, who had been absent to attend an evening mass at a distant church, had but just returned, and was changing her garments, which had been wetted by the storm. There were as yet no tidings of Gurth and his charge, which should long since have been driven home from the forest and such was the insecurity of the period, as to render it probable that the delay might be explained by some depreciation of the outlaws, with whom the adjacent forest abounded, or by the violence of some neighbouring baron, whose consciousness of strength made him equally negligent of the laws of property. The matter was of consequence, for great part of the domestic wealth of the Saxon proprietors consisted in numerous herds of swine, especially in forest-land, where those animals easily found their food.</p> 
<p>Besides these subjects of anxiety, the Saxon thane was impatient for the presence of his favourite clown Wamba, whose jests, such as they were, served for a sort of seasoning to his evening meal, and to the deep draughts of ale and wine with which he was in the habit of accompanying it. Add to all this, Cedric had fasted since noon, and his usual supper hour was long past, a cause of irritation common to country squires, both in ancient and modern times. His displeasure was expressed in broken sentences, partly muttered to himself, partly addressed to the domestics who stood around; and particularly to his cupbearer, who offered him from time to time, as a sedative, a silver goblet filled with wine ---"Why tarries the Lady Rowena?"</p> 
<p>"She is but changing her head-gear," replied a female attendant, with as much confidence as the favourite lady's-maid usually answers the master of a modern family; "you would not wish her to sit down to the banquet in her hood and kirtle? and no lady within the shire can be quicker in arraying herself than my mistress."</p> 
<p>This undeniable argument produced a sort of acquiescent umph! on the part of the Saxon, with the addition, "I wish her devotion may choose fair weather for the next visit to St John's Kirk; ---but what, in the name of ten devils," continued he, turning to the cupbearer, and raising his voice as if happy to have found a channel into which he might divert his indignation without fear or control---"what, in the name of ten devils, keeps Gurth so long afield? I suppose we shall have an evil account of the herd; he was wont to be a faithful and cautious drudge, and I had destined him for something better; perchance I might even have made him one of my warders."*</p> 
<p>* The original has "Cnichts", by which the Saxons seem to * have designated a class of military attendants, sometimes * free, sometimes bondsmen, but always ranking above an * ordinary domestic, whether in the royal household or in * those of the aldermen and thanes. But the term cnicht, * now spelt knight, having been received into the English * language as equivalent to the Norman word chevalier, I * have avoided using it in its more ancient sense, to * prevent confusion. L. T.</p> 
<p>Oswald the cupbearer modestly suggested, "that it was scarce an hour since the tolling of the curfew;" an ill-chosen apology, since it turned upon a topic so harsh to Saxon ears.</p> 
<p>"The foul fiend," exclaimed Cedric, "take the curfew-bell, and the tyrannical bastard by whom it was devised, and the heartless slave who names it with a Saxon tongue to a Saxon ear! The curfew!" he added, pausing, "ay, the curfew; which compels true men to extinguish their lights, that thieves and robbers may work their deeds in darkness!--- Ay, the curfew;---Reginald Front-de-Boeuf and Philip de Malvoisin know the use of the curfew as well as William the Bastard himself, or e'er a Norman adventurer that fought at Hastings. I shall hear, I guess, that my property has been swept off to save from starving the hungry banditti, whom they cannot support but by theft and robbery. My faithful slave is murdered, and my goods are taken for a prey --and Wamba---where is Wamba? Said not some one he had gone forth with Gurth?"</p> 
<p>Oswald replied in the affirmative.</p> 
<p>"Ay? why this is better and better! he is carried off too, the Saxon fool, to serve the Norman lord. Fools are we all indeed that serve them, and fitter subjects for their scorn and laughter, than if we were born with but half our wits. But I will be avenged," he added, starting from his chair in impatience at the supposed injury, and catching hold of his boar-spear; "I will go with my complaint to the great council; I have friends, I have followers---man to man will I appeal the Norman to the lists; let him come in his plate and his mail, and all that can render cowardice bold; I have sent such a javelin as this through a stronger fence than three of their war shields!---Haply they think me old; but they shall find, alone and childless as I am, the blood of Hereward is in the veins of Cedric.---Ah, Wilfred, Wilfred!" he exclaimed in a lower tone, "couldst thou have ruled thine unreasonable passion, thy father had not been left in his age like the solitary oak that throws out its shattered and unprotected branches against the full sweep of the tempest!" The reflection seemed to conjure into sadness his irritated feelings. Replacing his javelin, he resumed his seat, bent his looks downward, and appeared to be absorbed in melancholy reflection.</p> 
<p>From his musing, Cedric was suddenly awakened by the blast of a horn, which was replied to by the clamorous yells and barking of all the dogs in the hall, and some twenty or thirty which were quartered in other parts of the building. It cost some exercise of the white truncheon, well seconded by the exertions of the domestics, to silence this canine clamour.</p> 
<p>"To the gate, knaves!" said the Saxon, hastily, as soon as the tumult was so much appeased that the dependants could hear his voice. "See what tidings that horn tells us of---to announce, I ween, some hership* and robbery which has been done upon my lands."</p> 
<p>* Pillage.</p> 
<p>Returning in less than three minutes, a warder announced "that the Prior Aymer of Jorvaulx, and the good knight Brian de Bois-Guilbert, commander of the valiant and venerable order of Knights Templars, with a small retinue, requested hospitality and lodging for the night, being on their way to a tournament which was to be held not far from Ashby-de-la-Zouche, on the second day from the present."</p> 
<p>"Aymer, the Prior Aymer? Brian de Bois-Guilbert?"---muttered Cedric; "Normans both;---but Norman or Saxon, the hospitality of Rotherwood must not be impeached; they are welcome, since they have chosen to halt---more welcome would they have been to have ridden further on their way---But it were unworthy to murmur for a night's lodging and a night's food; in the quality of guests, at least, even Normans must suppress their insolence.---Go, Hundebert," he added, to a sort of major-domo who stood behind him with a white wand; "take six of the attendants, and introduce the strangers to the guests' lodging. Look after their horses and mules, and see their train lack nothing. Let them have change of vestments if they require it, and fire, and water to wash, and wine and ale; and bid the cooks add what they hastily can to our evening meal; and let it be put on the board when those strangers are ready to share it. Say to them, Hundebert, that Cedric would himself bid them welcome, but he is under a vow never to step more than three steps from the dais of his own hall to meet any who shares not the blood of Saxon royalty. Begone! see them carefully tended; let them not say in their pride, the Saxon churl has shown at once his poverty and his avarice."</p> 
<p>The major-domo departed with several attendants, to execute his master's commands.</p> 
<p>"The Prior Aymer!" repeated Cedric, looking to Oswald, "the brother, if I mistake not, of Giles de Mauleverer, now lord of Middleham?"</p> 
<p>Oswald made a respectful sign of assent. "His brother sits in the seat, and usurps the patrimony, of a better race, the race of Ulfgar of Middleham; but what Norman lord doth not the same? This Prior is, they say, a free and jovial priest, who loves the wine-cup and the bugle-horn better than bell and book: Good; let him come, he shall be welcome. How named ye the Templar?"</p> 
<p>"Brian de Bois-Guilbert."</p> 
<p>"Bois-Guilbert," said Cedric, still in the musing, half-arguing tone, which the habit of living among dependants had accustomed him to employ, and which resembled a man who talks to himself rather than to those around him---"Bois-Guilbert? that name has been spread wide both for good and evil. They say he is valiant as the bravest of his order; but stained with their usual vices, pride, arrogance, cruelty, and voluptuousness; a hard-hearted man, who knows neither fear of earth, nor awe of heaven. So say the few warriors who have returned from Palestine.---Well; it is but for one night; he shall be welcome too.---Oswald, broach the oldest wine-cask; place the best mead, the mightiest ale, the richest morat, the most sparkling cider, the most odoriferous pigments, upon the board; fill the largest horns*</p> 
<p>* These were drinks used by the Saxons, as we are informed * by Mr Turner: Morat was made of honey flavoured with the * juice of mulberries; Pigment was a sweet and rich liquor, * composed of wine highly spiced, and sweetened also with * honey; the other liquors need no explanation. L. T.</p> 
<p>---Templars and Abbots love good wines and good measure. ---Elgitha, let thy Lady Rowena, know we shall not this night expect her in the hall, unless such be her especial pleasure."</p> 
<p>"But it will be her especial pleasure," answered Elgitha, with great readiness, "for she is ever desirous to hear the latest news from Palestine."</p> 
<p>Cedric darted at the forward damsel a glance of hasty resentment; but Rowena, and whatever belonged to her, were privileged and secure from his anger. He only replied, "Silence, maiden; thy tongue outruns thy discretion. Say my message to thy mistress, and let her do her pleasure. Here, at least, the descendant of Alfred still reigns a princess." Elgitha left the apartment.</p> 
<p>"Palestine!" repeated the Saxon; "Palestine! how many ears are turned to the tales which dissolute crusaders, or hypocritical pilgrims, bring from that fatal land! I too might ask---I too might enquire---I too might listen with a beating heart to fables which the wily strollers devise to cheat us into hospitality ---but no---The son who has disobeyed me is no longer mine; nor will I concern myself more for his fate than for that of the most worthless among the millions that ever shaped the cross on their shoulder, rushed into excess and blood-guiltiness, and called it an accomplishment of the will of God."</p> 
<p>He knit his brows, and fixed his eyes for an instant on the ground; as he raised them, the folding doors at the bottom of the hall were cast wide, and, preceded by the major-domo with his wand, and four domestics bearing blazing torches, the guests of the evening entered the apartment.</p>

<p>于是新的多灾多难的一页开始了，</p> 
<p>精力充沛、身体强壮、黄发碧眼的撒克逊人</p> 
<p>在日耳曼海的咆哮声中登上了英国的荒凉海岸。</p> 
<p>汤姆森：《自由》(注)</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)詹姆斯·汤姆森（1700—1748），苏格兰诗人。自由》是他的一篇长诗，诗中将自由拟人化，铺叙它在希腊、罗马和英国的沧桑变化。英国最早的居民为克尔特人，公元五世纪，撒克逊人才从北欧来到不列颠岛。</p> 
<p>这是一间非常长又非常阔，但矮得极不相称的大厅，厅里放着一张栎木长桌子，它的木板十分粗糙，是直接从森林中砍伐的，几乎没有刨过，桌上已摆好了撒克逊人塞德里克的晚餐。屋顶除了横梁和椽子上铺的一层木板和茅草，没有任何东酉与天空隔开；大厅的两头都有一个大壁炉，由于烟囱的结构十分简陋，烟雾闯进屋内的至少与飞到外面的一样多。在它持续不断的熏染下，这间屋顶不高的大厅的横梁和椽子都蒙上了一层墨黑的烟又。大厅的墙壁上挂着打仗和狩猎的用具，每个屋角都有两扇折门，通往这栋空旷住宅的各个部分。</p> 
<p>房屋的其他设施也都保持着撒克逊时期粗犷简陋的外表，塞德里克是以这种风格自豪的。地面由泥土与石灰混合而成，夯得结结实实，与我们现在仓库的地面差不多。它的一头，大约占屋长的四分之一，比其他地面高出一级，称作台座，专供家族的长辈或显贵的客人使用。为了这个目的，一张铺了富丽堂皇的大红台布的桌子，横放在土台上；另一张比它长、比它矮的饭桌，从上台中部一直延伸到大厅末端，这是供家人和下等人使用的。这两张桌子构成了一个T字形，这种古代的餐桌排列方式，在牛津或剑桥那些历史悠久的学院中还能见到。士台上放着雕花栎木制作的笨重座椅和靠背长椅，在升高的餐桌和这些坐位顶上张着天篷、它可以在一定程度上给坐在这里的大人物挡风，尤其是挡雨，因为那个结构简陋的屋子有些地方是常常会漏水的。</p> 
<p>大厅上首土台部分的墙壁挂满了布慢或帷幕，地上铺着地毯，这些装饰品都做工精细，有些像挂毯，或者绣了鲜艳的、甚至华丽的花纹。在下面那行桌子上空，我们已经说过，屋顶下没有任何遮盖；毛糙的灰泥墙壁空空荡荡的，什么也没挂，简陋的泥地也不铺地毯；餐桌上没有台布，周围只用一些粗糙笨重的长凳代替椅子。</p> 
<p>上首桌子的正中，有两把椅子比其他的高一些，这是供家中的男女主人坐的，他们得主持宴会，这职责使他们获得了一个撒克逊人的尊贵称号，它的意思便是所谓“面包分配者”。</p> 
<p>这两张椅子前面都设有脚凳，它们雕刻精细，镶了象牙，作为它们独特的荣誉标志。撒克逊人塞德里克目前正坐在其中的一把椅子上，他虽然只是一个普通乡绅，也就是诺曼人所说的庄园主，但对这顿晚饭的不能准时开始非常生气，很不耐烦，简直跟从古到今的一切政府要员一样。</p> 
<p>确实，从这位一家之长的面貌看，他是个坦率的人，只是脾气有些急躁和粗暴。他不过中等身材，但肩膀宽阔，手臂又长，显得体格强壮，像一个习惯于忍受战争或打猎的辛劳的人。他脸膛方方的，生着一对大大的蓝眼睛，脸色开朗直爽，牙齿整齐，容貌端正，整个说来表现了一种性情忠厚，但时常不免焦躁生气的个性。高傲和猜疑流露在他的眼神中，因为他的一生就是倾注全力来维护不断遭到侵犯的权科；他那干脆、激烈、坚定的意志总是保持着警惕，密切注视着周围环境的变化。他的一头金黄色长发，在头顶和额上从中央分开，向两边一直垂到肩头；它似乎离苍白还很远，尽管塞德里克已年近花甲了。</p> 
<p>他穿一件草绿色紧身上衣，领圈和袖口镶有一种灰白色皮毛，这种专用作镶边的皮毛名为貂皮，但不如貂皮名贵，据说是用灰色的松鼠皮做的。上衣设扣纽扣，可以看到里边是一件紧紧裹在身上的绛红色里衣；下身的裤子也同样颜色，只是很短，没有达到两腿的下部，膝盖露在外面。脚上的鞋子与农民穿的同一式样，但质地较好，鞋面上有镀金的搭扣。他的两臂都戴着金镯子，脖颈上套着一只阔阔的项圈，是同样的贵金属做的。他腰里的皮带上也镶着许多金饰钮，带子里插着一把笔直的双刃短剑，头尖尖的，几乎垂直地靠在他的腿边。他的椅子背后挂着一件镶裘皮的深红呢大氅，还有一顶绣得很讲究的同样料子的便帽，它们便是这位富裕的地主外出时的全部装束。一把带有又阔又亮的钢尖的、狩猎用的短梭镖，靠在他的椅背后面，每逢他出门时，视情况需要，它可以作他的手杖，也可以作武器。</p> 
<p>几个仆人注视着这位撒克逊贵人的脸色，等待着他的命令，他们的服饰在不同程度上介于主人的华丽和放猪人葛四的粗劣寒酸之间。两三个地位较高的仆役站在土台上，主人的背后；其余的都待在大厅中较低的部分。伺候在这里的还有其他生物：两三只生着乱蓬蓬的粗毛的高大灵提，那种捕捉野鹿和狼用的猎犬；几只一般的猎狗，这种狗骨路大，脖颈粗，头大耳长，但跑得较慢；另外还有一两只现在称作便犬的小猎狗；它们似乎对这顿姗姗来迟的晚餐已等得不耐烦，只是因为天生善于揣摩人的表情，还耐着性子，没敢打扰主人郁郁不乐的沉默，或者对主人放在喂狗的木盘旁边，随时准备用来打退这些四脚侍从的骚扰的小白木棍，还存有戒心，不敢乱来。唯独一只骇人的老狼狗，由于一向得宠，放肆惯了，钻到了那只高贵的椅子旁边，为了引起主人的注意，有时还不惜冒险，把毛茸茸的大脑袋凑近他的膝盖，或者把鼻子伸到他的手上。然而它也遭到了严厉的申斥：“下去，巴尔德，下去！我现在没心思跟你闹着玩。”</p> 
<p>确实，正如我们看到的，塞德里克这时的心情很不平静。罗文娜小姐到远处的教堂作晚祷后，刚刚回家，路上给暴风雨淋湿了，正在更换衣服。葛四也还没有消息，按理说，他应该早把猪群赶回家了，而在这个不太平的时代，造成这种延误的原因很可能是遇到了强盗，在附近的森林里这种人多似牛毛，即或不然，邻近的某些贵族也无法无天，他们自恃力量强大，同样不把别人的财物放在眼里。这件事会造成严重后果，因为撒克逊业主的家产大多只是拥有无数猪群，在森林地带尤其如此 ——在那里这些牲口是很容易找到食物的。</p> 
<p>除了这些心事，撒克逊庄园主还为他宠爱的小丑汪八迟迟不归，十分焦急；这个人的说笑逗趣，尽管不见得怎么样，对他的晚餐，以及晚餐时照例要大口大口喝个不停的啤酒和葡萄酒，可以说是一盘不可缺少的菜肴。不仅如此，塞德里克从中午起还没吃过东西，而平常的晚餐时间早已过去，这不论在古代和现代，都会成为乡绅们心情烦躁的原因。他的不快表现在断断续续的一些话中，它们一部分是自言自语，一部分是对周围的仆人，尤其是那个斟酒人讲的，后者每隔一会，总要给他的银高脚杯把酒斟满，似乎这是一种镇静剂。“罗文娜小姐怎么还在磨蹭？”</p> 
<p>“她正在换帽子呢，”一个女佣人答道，口气满不在乎，就像现代家庭中一位小姐的心腹使女那样，“您不致要她戴着风帽、穿着斗篷来就餐吧？全郡还没有一个小姐穿衣服像我的主人那么快的。”</p> 
<p>这个不可否认的论点，使那位撒克逊主人哑口无言，只得“哼”了一声，表示默认，然后又道：“我希望她下次上圣约翰教堂做礼拜，要挑一个晴朗的日子。但那是怎么回事？”他转过脸去对斟酒人继续道，还提高了嗓音，好像找到了另一条发泄愤怒的畅通无阻的渠道，“究竟是什么魔鬼让葛四在野外待了这么久？我担心我们那些猪恐怕要遭殃了；他做事一向忠实、谨慎，我本来已预备提拔他，说不定还会让他给我当一名卫士呢。”</p> 
<p>斟酒人奥斯瓦尔德小心地提醒他道：“宵禁的钟声响过还不到一个钟头。”不过这辩解选择得不太合适，因为它触及了一个敏感的问题，在塞德里克听来非常刺耳。</p> 
<p>“什么宵禁钟，让它见鬼去吧，”撒克逊人喊道，“这是残暴的私生子(注)搞的花招，只有没良心的奴才会用撒克逊人的嘴巴对着撒克逊人的耳朵讲这种话！宵禁！”他停了一下又说，“哼，宵禁，这无非是强迫正直的人熄灭灯火，可以让窃贼和强盗在黑暗中横行不法！哼，宵禁！牛面将军雷金纳德和菲利普·马尔沃辛，还有黑斯廷斯战役中的每个诺曼冒险家，都像私生子威廉一样，懂得宵禁的妙用。我琢磨，我的家产一定给那些强盗抢走”了，他们养不活这些匪徒，只得靠偷盗和掠夺来维持这支部队。我的忠实奴隶给杀害了，我的家畜给抢走了；还有汪八——汪八在哪儿呢？不是有人说他是跟葛四一起出去的吗？”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)指征服者威廉，他是诺曼底公爵罗伯特一世的私生子。</p> 
<p>奥斯瓦尔德作了肯定的回答。</p> 
<p>“哼！这真是太妙了！把他也带走，让撒克逊小丑去给诺曼老爷逗乐。说真的，我们凡是替诺曼人当差的都是小丑，都应该遭到他们的轻视和嘲笑，比生来只有半个脑袋的家伙更适合当这种脚色。但是我非报仇不可，”他又说，想起可能受到的损害，从椅上跳了起来，抓住了那支打野猪的梭镖，“我要向乡绅会议(注)提出申诉。那里有我的朋友，他们会支持我；我要向诺曼人提出挑战，一对一进行决斗。让他们全身披挂的来吧，不论他们穿什么，胆小鬼还是胆小鬼。我曾用这样的梭镖，穿透过比他们的盾牌还厚三倍的护身甲！也许他们以为我老了，但他们会发现，尽管我了然一身，没有孩子，塞德里克的血管里流的仍是赫里沃德的血。唉，威尔弗莱德，威尔弗莱德！”他轻轻地喊道，“要是你能克制一下你那没有道理的感情，你的父亲便不致到了风烛残年，还像一棵孤单的栎树站在暴风雨中，听任它的枝柯遭受风吹雨打了！”这么一想，他的烦躁心情变成了一种痛苦的感觉。他把梭镖放回原处，重又坐下，把目光注视着地面，仿佛沉浸在忧伤的思索中。</p>

<p>(注)诺曼王朝期间由国有土地承租人组成的咨询会议。</p> 
<p>这时蓦地传来了一阵号角声，把塞德里克从沉思中惊醒了，接着又响起了汪汪不断的狗吠声，不仅大厅上的狗，还有关在房子里其他地方的二三十条狗，都参加了这场狗声大合唱，最后多亏那根白木棍加上仆人们的共同努力，骚乱才得以平息。</p> 
<p>“小子们，到门口看看！”撒克逊人等狗叫大致平静，仆役们可以听清他的声音时说道。一谁在那里吹号角，是怎么回事？我想，这也许是告诉我们，在我的土地上发生了抢劫或掳掠的勾当。”</p> 
<p>过了不到三分钟，一个家丁回来报告道：“茹尔沃修道院的艾默长老，还有英勇而高贵的圣殿骑士团统领布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔骑士，带着一小队人，要求在庄上借宿一夜，吃些东西，他们是前往阿什贝镇，预备参加后天在那里举行的比武大会的。”</p> 
<p>“艾默……艾默长老！布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔！”塞德里克嘟哝道，“两个诺曼人；但不论诺曼人还是撒克逊人，罗瑟伍德一向好客，不会把远道而来的人拒诸门外；他们要借宿，我们欢迎，如果他们肯多跑些路，上别处投宿，我们更加欢迎，但是不值得为一夜的借宿，一夜的酒食多费唇舌；既然是客人，哪怕诺曼人也不致太嚣张吧。去，亨德贝特，”他扭头对站在背后手持管家的白权杖的仆人说道，“带六个小厮把那伙人领往客房休息。照料好他们的马和骡子，别让他们缺少什么。如果他们要换衣服，就让他们换，给他们准备火和洗澡水，还有啤酒和葡萄酒；吩咐厨子尽快给我们的晚餐增加一些食物，等这些客人预备就餐时就端上桌来。对他们说，亨德贝特，塞德里克本想亲自迎接他们，但他发过誓，绝不为了接待任何没有撒克逊高贵血统的人，离开他家客厅的土坛三步。去吧，好好招待他们，别让他们自鸣得意，说我们撒克逊庄户人又寒酸又吝啬。”</p> 
<p>管家率领几个仆人去执行主人的命令了。“艾默长老！”塞德里克望着奥斯瓦尔德念叨道。“如果我记得不错，是贾尔斯·莫尔维勒，现在的米德尔海姆勋爵的兄弟吧？”</p> 
<p>奥斯瓦尔德恭敬地点了点头。“他的哥哥现在独自当家，还侵占了另一份更好的家产——乌尔弗加·米德尔海姆家的产业；但是哪一个诺曼贵族不是这样呢？据说，这位修道院长是个不拘小节、逍遥快活的教士，对杯中物和打猎，比对钟声和经卷更有兴趣。好，让他来吧，可以欢迎他。你说，那个圣殿骑士名叫什么？”</p> 
<p>“布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔。”</p> 
<p>“布瓦吉贝尔！”塞德里克说，用的仍是既像独自沉思，又像跟人讨论的口气，这是生活在仆役中间的主人常有的习惯，仿佛他们是在自言自语，不是在跟周围的人讲话。“布瓦吉贝尔！他的名字传播得很广，有讲好的，也有讲坏的。据说这个人非常勇敢，在那个骑士团里是个首屈一指的人物，但也沾染了他们的恶劣作风—— 骄横，自大，残忍，好色，心肠狠毒，不怕天不怕地，什么都不在他眼里。这是从巴勒斯坦回来的几个武士讲的。好吧，既然只住一宵，对他也可以表示欢迎。奥斯瓦尔德，打开年代最久的酒桶；拿最好的蜂蜜酒，最浓烈的麦酒，最醇厚的桑仁酒，最新鲜的苹果酒，最香最甜的豆蔻酒招待他们；用最大的羊角酒杯把酒斟得满满的，圣殿骑士和修道士都是好酒量。艾尔吉莎，告诉你的罗文娜小姐，今晚她不必到大厅用膳了，除非她自己乐意来。”</p> 
<p>“但是她一定乐意来的，”艾尔吉莎马上答道，“因为她总是想听听巴勒斯坦来的最新消息。”</p> 
<p>塞德里克气呼呼的，瞪了一眼这位口没遮拦的使女；可是罗文娜和属于她的一切都享有特权，是不可侵犯的。他只得答道：“小丫头，别多嘴，你的舌头已经越出范围了。把我的话传达给你的主人，让她自己决定怎么做。至少在这儿，阿尔弗烈德(注)的后裔还是一位公主。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)阿尔弗烈德（849—899），威廉一世征服英国前，撒克逊王朝的一位君主，公元871—899年在位。他曾多次打退丹麦人的入侵，因此成为英国传说中的英雄人物，被称为阿尔弗烈德大王。在本书中，塞德里克认为罗文娜是阿尔弗烈德的后代。</p> 
<p>艾尔吉莎离开了大厅。</p> 
<p>“巴勒斯坦！”撒克逊人叨咕道，“巴勒斯坦！放荡的十字军和虚伪的朝圣者从那个不祥的地方带来的故事，偏偏有那么多人喜欢听！我也可以问……可以打听…… 可以怀着一颗跳动的心，听那些狡猾的流浪汉为了骗一顿饭吃编造的海外奇谈，但是不，我不想这么做，不服从老子的儿子不再是我的儿子；我也不必关心他的命运，对我说来，他与千千万万肩上镶十字架花纹的家伙一样，都是根本不值得我关心的，这些人行为偏激，嗜杀成性，却把这称作实施上帝的意旨。”(注)</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)第三次十字军（1189—1192）主要由英国的狮心王理查和法王腓力二世领导。理杏是诺曼人，参加战斗的骑士也大多为诺曼人，因此它遭到塞德里克的强烈抨击。</p> 
<p>他蹙紧眉头，朝地上注视了一会，等他抬起头来的时候，大厅末端的两扇折门打开了，总管手持权杖在前引导，四个家人举着明晃晃的火炬，带领晚上到达的客人走进了大厅。</p>
