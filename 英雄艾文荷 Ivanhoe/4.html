Chaucer.</p> 
<p>Notwithstanding the occasional exhortation and chiding of his companion, the noise of the horsemen's feet continuing to approach, Wamba could not be prevented from lingering occasionally on the road, upon every pretence which occurred; now catching from the hazel a cluster of half-ripe nuts, and now turning his head to leer after a cottage maiden who crossed their path. The horsemen, therefore, soon overtook them on the road.</p> 
<p>Their numbers amounted to ten men, of whom the two who rode foremost seemed to be persons of considerable importance, and the others their attendants. It was not difficult to ascertain the condition and character of one of these personages. He was obviously an ecclesiastic of high rank; his dress was that of a Cistercian Monk, but composed of materials much finer than those which the rule of that order admitted. His mantle and hood were of the best Flanders cloth, and fell in ample, and not ungraceful folds, around a handsome, though somewhat corpulent person. His countenance bore as little the marks of self-denial, as his habit indicated contempt of worldly splendour. His features might have been called good, had there not lurked under the pent-house of his eye, that sly epicurean twinkle which indicates the cautious voluptuary. In other respects, his profession and situation had taught him a ready command over his countenance, which he could contract at pleasure into solemnity, although its natural expression was that of good-humoured social indulgence. In defiance of conventual rules, and the edicts of popes and councils, the sleeves of this dignitary were lined and turned up with rich furs, his mantle secured at the throat with a golden clasp, and the whole dress proper to his order as much refined upon and ornamented, as that of a quaker beauty of the present day, who, while she retains the garb and costume of her sect continues to give to its simplicity, by the choice of materials and the mode of disposing them, a certain air of coquettish attraction, savouring but too much of the vanities of the world.</p> 
<p>This worthy churchman rode upon a well-fed ambling mule, whose furniture was highly decorated, and whose bridle, according to the fashion of the day, was ornamented with silver bells. In his seat he had nothing of the awkwardness of the convent, but displayed the easy and habitual grace of a well-trained horseman. Indeed, it seemed that so humble a conveyance as a mule, in however good case, and however well broken to a pleasant and accommodating amble, was only used by the gallant monk for travelling on the road. A lay brother, one of those who followed in the train, had, for his use on other occasions, one of the most handsome Spanish jennets ever bred at Andalusia, which merchants used at that time to import, with great trouble and risk, for the use of persons of wealth and distinction. The saddle and housings of this superb palfrey were covered by a long foot-cloth, which reached nearly to the ground, and on which were richly embroidered, mitres, crosses, and other ecclesiastical emblems. Another lay brother led a sumpter mule, loaded probably with his superior's baggage; and two monks of his own order, of inferior station, rode together in the rear, laughing and conversing with each other, without taking much notice of the other members of the cavalcade.</p> 
<p>The companion of the church dignitary was a man past forty, thin, strong, tall, and muscular; an athletic figure, which long fatigue and constant exercise seemed to have left none of the softer part of the human form, having reduced the whole to brawn, bones, and sinews, which had sustained a thousand toils, and were ready to dare a thousand more. His head was covered with a scarlet cap, faced with fur---of that kind which the French call "mortier", from its resemblance to the shape of an inverted mortar. His countenance was therefore fully displayed, and its expression was calculated to impress a degree of awe, if not of fear, upon strangers. High features, naturally strong and powerfully expressive, had been burnt almost into Negro blackness by constant exposure to the tropical sun, and might, in their ordinary state, be said to slumber after the storm of passion had passed away; but the projection of the veins of the forehead, the readiness with which the upper lip and its thick black moustaches quivered upon the slightest emotion, plainly intimated that the tempest might be again and easily awakened. His keen, piercing, dark eyes, told in every glance a history of difficulties subdued, and dangers dared, and seemed to challenge opposition to his wishes, for the pleasure of sweeping it from his road by a determined exertion of courage and of will; a deep scar on his brow gave additional sternness to his countenance, and a sinister expression to one of his eyes, which had been slightly injured on the same occasion, and of which the vision, though perfect, was in a slight and partial degree distorted.</p> 
<p>The upper dress of this personage resembled that of his companion in shape, being a long monastic mantle; but the colour, being scarlet, showed that he did not belong to any of the four regular orders of monks. On the right shoulder of the mantle there was cut, in white cloth, a cross of a peculiar form. This upper robe concealed what at first view seemed rather inconsistent with its form, a shirt, namely, of linked mail, with sleeves and gloves of the same, curiously plaited and interwoven, as flexible to the body as those which are now wrought in the stocking-loom, out of less obdurate materials. The fore-part of his thighs, where the folds of his mantle permitted them to be seen, were also covered with linked mail; the knees and feet were defended by splints, or thin plates of steel, ingeniously jointed upon each other; and mail hose, reaching from the ankle to the knee, effectually protected the legs, and completed the rider's defensive armour. In his girdle he wore a long and double-edged dagger, which was the only offensive weapon about his person.</p> 
<p>He rode, not a mule, like his companion, but a strong hackney for the road, to save his gallant war-horse, which a squire led behind, fully accoutred for battle, with a chamfron or plaited head-piece upon his head, having a short spike projecting from the front. On one side of the saddle hung a short battle-axe, richly inlaid with Damascene carving; on the other the rider's plumed head-piece and hood of mail, with a long two-handed sword, used by the chivalry of the period. A second squire held aloft his master's lance, from the extremity of which fluttered a small banderole, or streamer, bearing a cross of the same form with that embroidered upon his cloak. He also carried his small triangular shield, broad enough at the top to protect the breast, and from thence diminishing to a point. It was covered with a scarlet cloth, which prevented the device from being seen.</p> 
<p>These two squires were followed by two attendants, whose dark visages, white turbans, and the Oriental form of their garments, showed them to be natives of some distant Eastern country.*</p> 
<p>* Note B. Negro Slaves.</p> 
<p>The whole appearance of this warrior and his retinue was wild and outlandish; the dress of his squires was gorgeous, and his Eastern attendants wore silver collars round their throats, and bracelets of the same metal upon their swarthy arms and legs, of which the former were naked from the elbow, and the latter from mid-leg to ankle. Silk and embroidery distinguished their dresses, and marked the wealth and importance of their master; forming, at the same time, a striking contrast with the martial simplicity of his own attire. They were armed with crooked sabres, having the hilt and baldric inlaid with gold, and matched with Turkish daggers of yet more costly workmanship. Each of them bore at his saddle-bow a bundle of darts or javelins, about four feet in length, having sharp steel heads, a weapon much in use among the Saracens, and of which the memory is yet preserved in the martial exercise called "El Jerrid", still practised in the Eastern countries.</p> 
<p>The steeds of these attendants were in appearance as foreign as their riders. They were of Saracen origin, and consequently of Arabian descent; and their fine slender limbs, small fetlocks, thin manes, and easy springy motion, formed a marked contrast with the large-jointed, heavy horses, of which the race was cultivated in Flanders and in Normandy, for mounting the men-at-arms of the period in all the panoply of plate and mail; and which, placed by the side of those Eastern coursers, might have passed for a personification of substance and of shadow.</p> 
<p>The singular appearance of this cavalcade not only attracted the curiosity of Wamba, but excited even that of his less volatile companion. The monk he instantly knew to be the Prior of Jorvaulx Abbey, well known for many miles around as a lover of the chase, of the banquet, and, if fame did him not wrong, of other worldly pleasures still more inconsistent with his monastic vows.</p> 
<p>Yet so loose were the ideas of the times respecting the conduct of the clergy, whether secular or regular, that the Prior Aymer maintained a fair character in the neighbourhood of his abbey. His free and jovial temper, and the readiness with which he granted absolution from all ordinary delinquencies, rendered him a favourite among the nobility and principal gentry, to several of whom he was allied by birth, being of a distinguished Norman family. The ladies, in particular, were not disposed to scan too nicely the morals of a man who was a professed admirer of their sex, and who possessed many means of dispelling the ennui which was too apt to intrude upon the halls and bowers of an ancient feudal castle. The Prior mingled in the sports of the field with more than due eagerness, and was allowed to possess the best-trained hawks, and the fleetest greyhounds in the North Riding; circumstances which strongly recommended him to the youthful gentry. With the old, he had another part to play, which, when needful, he could sustain with great decorum. His knowledge of books, however superficial, was sufficient to impress upon their ignorance respect for his supposed learning; and the gravity of his deportment and language, with the high tone which he exerted in setting forth the authority of the church and of the priesthood, impressed them no less with an opinion of his sanctity. Even the common people, the severest critics of the conduct of their betters, had commiseration with the follies of Prior Aymer. He was generous; and charity, as it is well known, covereth a multitude of sins, in another sense than that in which it is said to do so in Scripture. The revenues of the monastery, of which a large part was at his disposal, while they gave him the means of supplying his own very considerable expenses, afforded also those largesses which he bestowed among the peasantry, and with which he frequently relieved the distresses of the oppressed. If Prior Aymer rode hard in the chase, or remained long at the banquet,---if Prior Aymer was seen, at the early peep of dawn, to enter the postern of the abbey, as he glided home from some rendezvous which had occupied the hours of darkness, men only shrugged up their shoulders, and reconciled themselves to his irregularities, by recollecting that the same were practised by many of his brethren who had no redeeming qualities whatsoever to atone for them. Prior Aymer, therefore, and his character, were well known to our Saxon serfs, who made their rude obeisance, and received his "benedicite, mes filz," in return.</p> 
<p>But the singular appearance of his companion and his attendants, arrested their attention and excited their wonder, and they could scarcely attend to the Prior of Jorvaulx' question, when he demanded if they knew of any place of harbourage in the vicinity; so much were they surprised at the half monastic, half military appearance of the swarthy stranger, and at the uncouth dress and arms of his Eastern attendants. It is probable, too, that the language in which the benediction was conferred, and the information asked, sounded ungracious, though not probably unintelligible, in the ears of the Saxon peasants.</p> 
<p>"I asked you, my children," said the Prior, raising his voice, and using the lingua Franca, or mixed language, in which the Norman and Saxon races conversed with each other, "if there be in this neighbourhood any good man, who, for the love of God, and devotion to Mother Church, will give two of her humblest servants, with their train, a night's hospitality and refreshment?"</p> 
<p>This he spoke with a tone of conscious importance, which formed a strong contrast to the modest terms which he thought it proper to employ.</p> 
<p>"Two of the humblest servants of Mother Church!" repeated Wamba to himself,---but, fool as he was, taking care not to make his observation audible; "I should like to see her seneschals, her chief butlers, and other principal domestics!"</p> 
<p>After this internal commentary on the Prior's speech, he raised his eyes, and replied to the question which had been put.</p> 
<p>"If the reverend fathers," he said, "loved good cheer and soft lodging, few miles of riding would carry them to the Priory of Brinxworth, where their quality could not but secure them the most honourable reception; or if they preferred spending a penitential evening, they might turn down yonder wild glade, which would bring them to the hermitage of Copmanhurst, where a pious anchoret would make them sharers for the night of the shelter of his roof and the benefit of his prayers."</p> 
<p>The Prior shook his head at both proposals.</p> 
<p>"Mine honest friend," said he, "if the jangling of thy bells had not dizzied thine understanding, thou mightst know "Clericus clericum non decimat"; that is to say, we churchmen do not exhaust each other's hospitality, but rather require that of the laity, giving them thus an opportunity to serve God in honouring and relieving his appointed servants."</p> 
<p>"It is true," replied Wamba, "that I, being but an ass, am, nevertheless, honoured to hear the bells as well as your reverence's mule; notwithstanding, I did conceive that the charity of Mother Church and her servants might be said, with other charity, to begin at home."</p> 
<p>"A truce to thine insolence, fellow," said the armed rider, breaking in on his prattle with a high and stern voice, "and tell us, if thou canst, the road to---How call'd you your Franklin, Prior Aymer?"</p> 
<p>"Cedric," answered the Prior; "Cedric the Saxon.---Tell me, good fellow, are we near his dwelling, and can you show us the road?"</p> 
<p>"The road will be uneasy to find," answered Gurth, who broke silence for the first time, "and the family of Cedric retire early to rest."</p> 
<p>"Tush, tell not me, fellow," said the military rider; "'tis easy for them to arise and supply the wants of travellers such as we are, who will not stoop to beg the hospitality which we have a right to command."</p> 
<p>"I know not," said Gurth, sullenly, "if I should show the way to my master's house, to those who demand as a right, the shelter which most are fain to ask as a favour."</p> 
<p>"Do you dispute with me, slave!" said the soldier; and, setting spurs to his horse, he caused him make a demivolte across the path, raising at the same time the riding rod which he held in his hand, with a purpose of chastising what he considered as the insolence of the peasant.</p> 
<p>Gurth darted at him a savage and revengeful scowl, and with a fierce, yet hesitating motion, laid his hand on the haft of his knife; but the interference of Prior Aymer, who pushed his mule betwixt his companion and the swineherd, prevented the meditated violence.</p> 
<p>"Nay, by St Mary, brother Brian, you must not think you are now in Palestine, predominating over heathen Turks and infidel Saracens; we islanders love not blows, save those of holy Church, who chasteneth whom she loveth.---Tell me, good fellow," said he to Wamba, and seconded his speech by a small piece of silver coin, "the way to Cedric the Saxon's; you cannot be ignorant of it, and it is your duty to direct the wanderer even when his character is less sanctified than ours."</p> 
<p>"In truth, venerable father," answered the Jester, "the Saracen head of your right reverend companion has frightened out of mine the way home---I am not sure I shall get there to-night myself."</p> 
<p>"Tush," said the Abbot, "thou canst tell us if thou wilt. This reverend brother has been all his life engaged in fighting among the Saracens for the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre; he is of the order of Knights Templars, whom you may have heard of; he is half a monk, half a soldier."</p> 
<p>"If he is but half a monk," said the Jester, "he should not be wholly unreasonable with those whom he meets upon the road, even if they should be in no hurry to answer questions that no way concern them."</p> 
<p>"I forgive thy wit," replied the Abbot, "on condition thou wilt show me the way to Cedric's mansion."</p> 
<p>"Well, then," answered Wamba, "your reverences must hold on this path till you come to a sunken cross, of which scarce a cubit's length remains above ground; then take the path to the left, for there are four which meet at Sunken Cross, and I trust your reverences will obtain shelter before the storm comes on."</p> 
<p>The Abbot thanked his sage adviser; and the cavalcade, setting spurs to their horses, rode on as men do who wish to reach their inn before the bursting of a night-storm. As their horses' hoofs died away, Gurth said to his companion, "If they follow thy wise direction, the reverend fathers will hardly reach Rotherwood this night."</p> 
<p>"No," said the Jester, grinning, "but they may reach Sheffield if they have good luck, and that is as fit a place for them. I am not so bad a woodsman as to show the dog where the deer lies, if I have no mind he should chase him."</p> 
<p>"Thou art right," said Gurth; "it were ill that Aymer saw the Lady Rowena; and it were worse, it may be, for Cedric to quarrel, as is most likely he would, with this military monk. But, like good servants let us hear and see, and say nothing."</p> 
<p>We return to the riders, who had soon left the bondsmen far behind them, and who maintained the following conversation in the Norman-French language, usually employed by the superior classes, with the exception of the few who were still inclined to boast their Saxon descent.</p> 
<p>"What mean these fellows by their capricious insolence?" said the Templar to the Benedictine, "and why did you prevent me from chastising it?"</p> 
<p>"Marry, brother Brian," replied the Prior, "touching the one of them, it were hard for me to render a reason for a fool speaking according to his folly; and the other churl is of that savage, fierce, intractable race, some of whom, as I have often told you, are still to be found among the descendants of the conquered Saxons, and whose supreme pleasure it is to testify, by all means in their power, their aversion to their conquerors."</p> 
<p>"I would soon have beat him into courtesy," observed Brian; "I am accustomed to deal with such spirits: Our Turkish captives are as fierce and intractable as Odin himself could have been; yet two months in my household, under the management of my master of the slaves, has made them humble, submissive, serviceable, and observant of your will. Marry, sir, you must be aware of the poison and the dagger; for they use either with free will when you give them the slightest opportunity."</p> 
<p>"Ay, but," answered Prior Aymer, "every land has its own manners and fashions; and, besides that beating this fellow could procure us no information respecting the road to Cedric's house, it would have been sure to have established a quarrel betwixt you and him had we found our way thither. Remember what I told you: this wealthy franklin is proud, fierce, jealous, and irritable, a withstander of the nobility, and even of his neighbors, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf and Philip Malvoisin, who are no babies to strive with. He stands up sternly for the privileges of his race, and is so proud of his uninterrupted descend from Hereward, a renowned champion of the Heptarchy, that he is universally called Cedric the Saxon; and makes a boast of his belonging to a people from whom many others endeaver to hide their descent, lest they should encounter a share of the 'vae victis,' or severities imposed upon the vanquished."</p> 
<p>"Prior Aymer," said the Templar, "you are a man of gallantry, learned in the study of beauty, and as expert as a troubadour in all matters concerning the 'arrets' of love; but I shall expect much beauty in this celebrated Rowena to counterbalance the self-denial and forbearance which I must exert if I am to court the favor of such a seditious churl as you have described her father Cedric."</p> 
<p>"Cedric is not her father," replied the Prior, "and is but of remote relation: she is descended from higher blood than even he pretends to, and is but distantly connected with him by birth. Her guardian, however, he is, self-constituted as I believe; but his ward is as dear to him as if she were his own child. Of her beauty you shall soon be judge; and if the purity of her complexion, and the majestic, yet soft expression of a mild blue eye, do not chase from your memory the black-tressed girls of Palestine, ay, or the houris of old Mahound's paradise, I am an infidel, and no true son of the church."</p> 
<p>"Should your boasted beauty," said the Templar, "be weighed in the balance and found wanting, you know our wager?"</p> 
<p>"My gold collar," answered the Prior, "against ten butts of Chian wine;---they are mine as securely as if they were already in the convent vaults, under the key of old Dennis the cellarer."</p> 
<p>"And I am myself to be judge," said the Templar, "and am only to be convicted on my own admission, that I have seen no maiden so beautiful since Pentecost was a twelvemonth. Ran it not so? ---Prior, your collar is in danger; I will wear it over my gorget in the lists of Ashby-de-la-Zouche."</p> 
<p>"Win it fairly," said the Prior, "and wear it as ye will; I will trust your giving true response, on your word as a knight and as a churchman. Yet, brother, take my advice, and file your tongue to a little more courtesy than your habits of predominating over infidel captives and Eastern bondsmen have accustomed you. Cedric the Saxon, if offended,---and he is noway slack in taking offence,---is a man who, without respect to your knighthood, my high office, or the sanctity of either, would clear his house of us, and send us to lodge with the larks, though the hour were midnight. And be careful how you look on Rowena, whom he cherishes with the most jealous care; an he take the least alarm in that quarter we are but lost men. It is said he banished his only son from his family for lifting his eyes in the way of affection towards this beauty, who may be worshipped, it seems, at a distance, but is not to be approached with other thoughts than such as we bring to the shrine of the Blessed Virgin."</p> 
<p>"Well, you have said enough," answered the Templar; "I will for a night put on the needful restraint, and deport me as meekly as a maiden; but as for the fear of his expelling us by violence, myself and squires, with Hamet and Abdalla, will warrant you against that disgrace. Doubt not that we shall be strong enough to make good our quarters."</p> 
<p>"We must not let it come so far," answered the Prior; "but here is the clown's sunken cross, and the night is so dark that we can hardly see which of the roads we are to follow. He bid us turn, I think to the left."</p> 
<p>"To the right," said Brian, "to the best of my remembrance."</p> 
<p>"To the left, certainly, the left; I remember his pointing with his wooden sword."</p> 
<p>"Ay, but he held his sword in his left hand, and so pointed across his body with it," said the Templar.</p> 
<p>Each maintained his opinion with sufficient obstinacy, as is usual in all such cases; the attendants were appealed to, but they had not been near enough to hear Wamba's directions. At length Brian remarked, what had at first escaped him in the twilight; "Here is some one either asleep, or lying dead at the foot of this cross---Hugo, stir him with the butt-end of thy lance."</p> 
<p>This was no sooner done than the figure arose, exclaiming in good French, "Whosoever thou art, it is discourteous in you to disturb my thoughts."</p> 
<p>"We did but wish to ask you," said the Prior, "the road to Rotherwood, the abode of Cedric the Saxon."</p> 
<p>"I myself am bound thither," replied the stranger; "and if I had a horse, I would be your guide, for the way is somewhat intricate, though perfectly well known to me."</p> 
<p>"Thou shalt have both thanks and reward, my friend," said the Prior, "if thou wilt bring us to Cedric's in safety."</p> 
<p>And he caused one of his attendants to mount his own led horse, and give that upon which he had hitherto ridden to the stranger, who was to serve for a guide.</p> 
<p>Their conductor pursued an opposite road from that which Wamba had recommended, for the purpose of misleading them. The path soon led deeper into the woodland, and crossed more than one brook, the approach to which was rendered perilous by the marshes through which it flowed; but the stranger seemed to know, as if by instinct, the soundest ground and the safest points of passage; and by dint of caution and attention, brought the party safely into a wilder avenue than any they had yet seen; and, pointing to a large low irregular building at the upper extremity, he said to the Prior, "Yonder is Rotherwood, the dwelling of Cedric the Saxon."</p> 
<p>This was a joyful intimation to Aymer, whose nerves were none of the strongest, and who had suffered such agitation and alarm in the course of passing through the dangerous bogs, that he had not yet had the curiosity to ask his guide a single question. Finding himself now at his ease and near shelter, his curiosity began to awake, and he demanded of the guide who and what he was.</p> 
<p>"A Palmer, just returned from the Holy Land," was the answer.</p> 
<p>"You had better have tarried there to fight for the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre," said the Templar.</p> 
<p>"True, Reverend Sir Knight," answered the Palmer, to whom the appearance of the Templar seemed perfectly familiar; "but when those who are under oath to recover the holy city, are found travelling at such a distance from the scene of their duties, can you wonder that a peaceful peasant like me should decline the task which they have abandoned?"</p> 
<p>The Templar would have made an angry reply, but was interrupted by the Prior, who again expressed his astonishment, that their guide, after such long absence, should be so perfectly acquainted with the passes of the forest.</p> 
<p>"I was born a native of these parts," answered their guide, and as he made the reply they stood before the mansion of Cedric;---a low irregular building, containing several court-yards or enclosures, extending over a considerable space of ground, and which, though its size argued the inhabitant to be a person of wealth, differed entirely from the tall, turretted, and castellated buildings in which the Norman nobility resided, and which had become the universal style of architecture throughout England.</p> 
<p>Rotherwood was not, however, without defences; no habitation, in that disturbed period, could have been so, without the risk of being plundered and burnt before the next morning. A deep fosse, or ditch, was drawn round the whole building, and filled with water from a neighbouring stream. A double stockade, or palisade, composed of pointed beams, which the adjacent forest supplied, defended the outer and inner bank of the trench. There was an entrance from the west through the outer stockade, which communicated by a drawbridge, with a similar opening in the interior defences. Some precautions had been taken to place those entrances under the protection of projecting angles, by which they might be flanked in case of need by archers or slingers.</p> 
<p>Before this entrance the Templar wound his horn loudly; for the rain, which had long threatened, began now to descend with great violence.</p>

<p>这些人大约有十来个，骑在前面的两个似乎是有些来头的大人物，其余的只是他们的随从。一个大人物的身份和地位是不难确定的，显然那是一个高级教士，他穿着西多会(注)修士的服装，只是它的质地比那个修会一般所允许的好得多。他的斗篷和风帽是用最精细的佛兰德毛料做的，褶裥宽大，然而裹在他有些发胖、但仍很优美的身体周围，并不显得臃肿。他的脸色很少安贫乐道的气息，正如他的衣着毫无鄙视世俗浮华的迹象。他的相貌可以算得端正，只是眼角边总是隐隐约约潜伏着一抹贪图逸乐的闪光，这表明他怀有一种小心掩饰的酒色之欲。在其他方面，他的职务和地位教会了他随时控制他的表情，他可以一下子板起脸来，变得道貌岸然，尽管那张脸天然轻松愉快，他的性情也爱好寻欢作乐。修道院的清规戒律，教皇和教廷的皇皇上谕都不能约束这位贵人，他翻起的衣袖上露出了珍贵的皮毛，他的斗篷领圈上用的是金搭襻，他的整个装束虽然与他的修会一致，但衣服之精美，饰物之华贵，就像当代公谊会女教徒，尽管保持着本教派的衣着打扮，然而精致的衣料和做工，仍能给简朴的服饰增添一种卖弄风情的妩媚意味，让人嗅到太多的世俗的虚荣作风。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)天主教隐修会中的一派，以会规严格著称。</p> 
<p>这位尊贵的教士骑着一匹饲养得很好的、步子从容不迫的骡子，它的全套装备都显得富丽堂皇，缰绳上按照当时的风气，饰有许多银铃铛。他骑在马上毫无出家人的笨拙姿势，态度相当悠闲、潇洒，完全像一个训练有素的骑士。确实，像骡子这种低等坐骑，不论装饰多么华丽，也不论步子多么从容不迫、安闲自在，对这位气派不凡的修士而言，只是供旅途中行路之用。他的后面跟着几名随从，其中一个在俗的仆役牵着一匹非常漂亮的酉班牙小种马，它来自安达卢西亚种马场，是供他在其他场合使用的——当时的商人费了不少周折，冒了不少风险，才引进了这种专供达官贵人乘坐的马。这匹马打扮得十分豪华，鞍子和马衣上还覆盖着一块长及马蹄、几乎触及地面的马披，马披上绣了复杂的花纹，其中有主教冠、十字架和教会的其他标记。另一个在俗的杂役牵着一匹驮骡，上面载的也许便是那位上司的行李；还有两个地位较低的修士、也属于他的修会，他们骑在最后，彼此说说笑笑，但不大理睬队伍中的其他人。</p> 
<p>高级教士的同伴约四十多岁，瘦高个子，生得身强力壮，肌肉发达，像一个运动员；长期的劳累和不断的磨练，似乎没有放过他身上任何一个较柔软的部位，以致他的整个身体几乎全由肌肉、骨骼和腱子组成，它们已经历过一千次的苦役，还准备再接受一千次。他头上戴一顶镶皮边的鲜红便帽，它的形状像倒置的研钵，因此法国人把它称作白帽。这使他的脸完全露在外面，它的表情即使不致引起恐惧，至少会使别人对他产生一定程度的忌惮。脸上各部分由于经常接触炎热的阳光，几乎晒得像黑人那么黑了；它们轮廓分明，天然具有强烈的表现力，但在一般情况下，它们只是处在感情的暴风雨过去之后的沉睡阶段；然而他额头上那些突出的青筋，以及情绪稍有激动，上嘴唇和浓密乌黑的唇髭便会出现的颤动，让人鲜明地看到，感情的暴风雨随时可能重新苏醒。他那对敏捷锐利的黑眼睛发出的每一次闪光都在表示，他一生中克服过无数困难，战胜过不少危险，因此任何违背他意愿的挑战，都不在他的话下，他可以凭他的坚定意志和勇敢无畏，把它们从他的道路上一扫而光。他的眉毛上有一条深深的刀伤，这使他的容貌更显得严峻可怕，也给他的一只眼睛增添了一种凶险的神色，这只眼睛同时受了些轻伤，虽然没有影响视力，但眼睛有些斜视和损坏了。</p> 
<p>这个人外面的衣服，从形状看与他的同伴穿的差不多，是一件修道士的长披风，但颜色是深红的，这说明他不属于四大修会中的任何一派(注)。披风的右肩上用白色绣着一个形状特殊的十字架。这件外衣里面却是一套与它不太协调的内衣，即镇子甲，袖管和手套也一样，都是用精细的工艺交错编缀而成，因而柔韧灵活，贴紧身体，就像现代织袜机上用细软材料织制的东西。从披风的重叠处可以看到，他的大腿的前部也是用锁子甲遮蔽的；膝部和脚则用薄钢片，或巧妙地连结在一起的金属薄片保护；铁甲袜子从膝部直达脚踝，有效地保护了小腿；这一切构成了骑马者的全部自卫装束。他的腰带上挂着一把双刃长匕首，它是他身上唯一的进攻性武器。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)天主教隐修会中的方济各会、多明我会、奥斯定会和加乐默罗会称为四大修会，它们提倡苦修，因此服饰十分朴素，大多穿灰色、黑色衣服</p> 
<p>他与他的同伴不同，骑的不是骡子，而是一匹专供长途跋涉的强壮的马，他那匹威武的战马则处在休息状态，由一个扈从牵在后面，但它仍是全副战时装备，头上套有钢片编制的马头甲，头甲前面矗立着一根短短的钢刺。马鞍一边挂着一柄短战斧，上面雕有大马士革钢的波形花纹；另一边挂着它的主人的翎饰头盔和镇子甲风帽，还有一把当时骑士用的长长的双手重剑。另一个扈从则高举着主人的长矛，矛尖上飘着一面小旗子或饰带，旗上也画有十字架，形状与他外衣上绣的一样。他还拿着他的小三角盾牌，它的顶端相当阔，足以保护胸部，下端则缩小成了尖头。盾牌上披着一块红布，这没了它的花纹。</p> 
<p>这两个扈从后面还跟着两个仆人，他们的脸黑黑的，围着白头巾，衣服也是东方式样，这说明他们来自某个遥远的东方国家(注1)。这位武壬和他的随从的整个外表，都带有原始的异国情调；那些扈从的衣着花哨华丽，那些东方仆役头颈里都戴着银项圈，黝黑的双腿和手臂上也戴着同样金属的镯子，手臂从肘部起，双腿从膝部到脚踝，都露在外面。丝绸和绣花是他们的服装的特色，既显示了他们的主人的富裕和高贵，又与他本人朴素的军人穿戴形成了鲜明的对照。他们的武器是弯弯的长马刀，刀柄和肩带都镶了金，工艺之精美可以与土耳其短剑媲美。他们的鞍头上都挂着一捆箭或镖枪，大约四英尺长，有锋利的钢尖，这是萨拉森人(注2)常用的武器，在东方国家的军事演习中使用的所谓钝头嫖枪，还保留着它的形状。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注1)见作者附注二。——原注</p> 
<p>(注2)萨拉森人，十字军东征时期，西方对阿拉伯人和穆斯林的称呼，意为东方人。</p> 
<p>这些仆人的马，从外表看与骑马的人一样，也来自外国。它们是萨拉森种，因此具备阿拉伯马的血统，腿细小玲珑，距毛不多，鬃毛稀少，步履安闲轻快，与那些强壮的大骨骼马具有明显的区别，后者是佛兰德和诺曼底培育出来的品种，专供当时穿戴全副盔甲的军人乘坐，东方的战马与它们并列在一起，简直跟它们的影子差不多。</p> 
<p>这一行人的独特样子，不仅引起了汪八的兴趣，而且使他那位不太活跃的同伴也产生了好奇心。那个修士，他一眼就认出，是茹尔沃修道院的住持，方圆数十英里内的居民都知道，这是一个爱好打猎和吃喝玩乐的人，如果传说不错的话，他有些娱乐活动，甚至与他的修会的戒律更显得南辕北辙。</p> 
<p>然而那个时代，不论对修道院外的教士还是修道院内的教士的行为，要求都是不高的，因此艾默长老在修道院一带还保持着美好的名声。他又性情随和，从不疾言厉色，对平常的一切过失随时准备给予赦免，这使他在当地的贵族和主要绅士中深得人心，何况他也出身诺曼世家，与其中一些人还沾些亲戚关系。尤其是夫人小姐们，她们看到一个人对她们公开表示赞赏，自然不忍心再对他的道德过多指责；在古老的封建城堡中，寂寞无聊难免侵入那里的客厅和闺房，而这个人却掌握着给她们消闲解闷的许多法儿。长老对野外的游戏总是特别热心，以致在本郡北区饲养了一大群训练有素的猎鹰和跑得最快的猎犬——这些情况使他大大得到贵族子弟们的赏识。对于年长的一代，他扮演的是另一种角色，每逢必要的时候，他便会彬彬有礼地粉墨登场。他的书本知识不论如何浅薄，仍足以使那些无知的人肃然起敬，认为他拥有丰富的学问；他的言谈举止庄重得体，在引经据典阐述教会和教士的权威时，他的声调高昂洪亮，这一切同样也使那些人对他产生了神圣的印象。哪怕喜欢对大人物吹毛求疵的老百姓，也能体谅艾默长老，不计较他的放荡行为．他为人慷慨；大家知道，善行可以掩盖无数罪恶，(注)但这与《圣经》上讲的意思并不相同。修道院的收入大部分由他支配，这给了他大肆挥霍的便利，但这也提供了他在农民中乐善好施的力量，使他可以时常解救被压迫者的疾苦。如果艾默长老热衷于打猎，或者流连灯红酒绿的生活，如果有人看见艾默长老在曙光初露时，从夜幕笼罩下的约会中悄悄回到家中，溜进修道院的后门，那么人们只会耸耸肩膀，对他的不拘小节一笑置之，认为他的许多同仁都在这么于，尽管他们并不像他那样具备将功折罪的条件。就因为这样，艾默长老和他的为人，我们那两位撒克逊奴仆相当熟悉，他们向他匆匆表示了一下敬意，他也向他们作了相应的问候：“我的孩子们，上帝祝福你们。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)《圣经》上译为“爱能遮掩许多的罪”，见《彼得前书》第4章第8节。</p> 
<p>但是他那位同伴和他的随从们与众不同的外表，吸引了他们的注意力，激起了他们的好奇心，以致在茹尔沃的长老问他们，附近一带有没有可以宿夜的地方时，他们几乎没有听到，只是在琢磨那个面目黝黑的陌生人又像修士，又像军人，究竟是何许人，他那些东方仆从穿的是奇装异服，又带着武器，究竟要来干什么。不过也可能长老的祝福和询问所用的语言，两个撒克逊农夫虽然不是一无所知，却觉得很不顺耳，因此不愿答理。</p> 
<p>“孩子们，我是问你们，”长老提高了嗓音，用法语混合语，那种诺曼人和撒克逊人交谈时使甩的语言问道，“这里附近一带，有没有哪位善心的人出于对上帝的爱，对神圣教会的虔诚，愿意给它的两个最谦卑的仆人和他们的随从提供方便，让他们得到一夜的食宿？”</p> 
<p>尽管他认为必须使用客气的词语，他的声调却显得高高在上，与前者构成了强烈的对照。’</p> 
<p>“教会的两名最谦卑的仆人！”汪八在心里念叨，他虽然愚蠢，却没有让这些想法形成语言，“那么它那些执事，那些管家，那些不可一世的高等仆役，应该算什么脚色呢！””</p> 
<p>在心里对长老的话作了这一番评注之后，他才抬起眼睛，回答向他提出的问题。</p> 
<p>“如果两位尊敬的教长，”他说，”希望吃到鲜美的酒菜，住进舒服的卧室，那么只消再走几英里，便可以到达布林沃思的修道院，在那里受到应有尽有的款待；但如果他们宁愿度过清苦的一夜，他们也可以穿过离此不远的一片林间空地，前往科普曼赫斯特的隐修所，那里有一位虔诚的修土，他会让他们在他简陋的小屋里过夜，与他一起做祷告。”</p> 
<p>修道院长对他的两个方案都频频摇头。</p> 
<p>“我的正直的朋友，”他说，“如果你帽上的铃子没有把你的头脑弄糊涂，你也许会懂得‘教士不向教士收什一税’这句话，那就是说，我们教士不会彼此要求款待，我们宁可叨扰俗人，让他们得到一个为上帝效劳的机会，招待和供应他所任命的仆人。”</p> 
<p>“确实，”汪八答道，“我只是一只驴子，现在居然也像大人的骡子一样荣幸，挂上了铃子；不过据在下看来，对教会和它的仆人的布施，也像其他布施一样，应该先从自己人做起。”</p> 
<p>“穷小子，不许你再放肆，”骑士用傲慢威严的声音插了进来，不让他继续讲下去，“如果你知道，就告诉我们，那条路怎么走……艾默长老，你讲的那个庄园主叫什么名字？”</p> 
<p>“塞德里克，”长老答道，“撒克逊人塞德里克。朋友，告诉我，他的家是不是在附近，你知道走哪条路吗？”</p> 
<p>“这条路可不容易找，”葛四第一次打破沉默，回答道，“而且塞德里克家的人早已睡了。”</p> 
<p>“住口，你这家伙，不准你这么跟我讲话，”骑马的军人说。“哪怕他们睡了，也得起床，满足我们的需要，我们这样的旅人不必要求他们，我们有权命令他们。”</p> 
<p>葛四听了，闷闷不乐地嘀咕道：“这些人认为他们有权得到食宿，不是像一般人那样要求照顾，对这样的人，我不知道我是不是应该把主人的住处告诉他们。”</p> 
<p>“不许跟我顶嘴，奴才！”军人说，踢了踢马，使它在路上打了半个圈，同时举起手中的马鞭，摆出要对农民的冒犯进行惩罚的架势。</p> 
<p>葛四皱紧眉头，用仇恨的目光狠狠瞪了他一眼，尽管还有些迟疑，他已咬紧牙关把一只手搭到了刀柄上；但是艾默长老把骡子骑到了猪棺儿和他的朋友之间。制止了这场一触即发的殴斗。</p> 
<p>“不，圣马利亚啊，要知道，布里恩兄弟，你现在不是在巴勒斯坦，你统治的不是土耳其异教徒和邪恶的萨拉森人；我们的岛民是不喜欢挨打的，除非那是神圣的教会对它所爱的人的惩罚。告诉我，小伙子，”他对江人说，一边递了一个小小的银币过去，“到撒克逊人塞德里克的家怎么走；你不可能不知道，再说，哪怕一个不像我们这样担任圣职的人迷了路，你也是有责任指点他的。”</p> 
<p>“说真的，尊敬的神父，”小丑答道，“您那位高贵的朋友的萨拉森作风，吓得我连回家的路也忘记了，我自己今晚回不回得了家，还不知道呢。”</p> 
<p>“别讲了，”修道院长说道，“你愿意的话是可以告诉我们的。这位尊贵的兄弟一生都在为恢复圣墓(注1)跟萨拉森人战斗，他是圣殿骑士团(注2)的骑士，这名称你也许听到过，他一半是修士，一半是战士。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注1)圣墓，指耶稣的墓，在耶路撒冷，十字军东征便是在夺回“主的坟墓”，拯救圣地耶路撒冷的名义下进行的。</p> 
<p>(注2)圣殿骑士团，十字军的主要组织之一，一种宗教性军事机构，奉行西多会的严格教规，总部设在耶路撒冷圣殿，故名。</p> 
<p>“既然他只是半个教士，”小丑答道，“他就不应该对路上遇到的人这么不客气，哪怕他们不想马上回答那些跟他们无关的问题，他也犯不着这么大动肝火。”</p> 
<p>“我宽恕你的强辩，”院长答道，“只要你肯告诉我前往塞德里克庄园的路。”</p> 
<p>“那么好吧，”汪八答道，“您只要沿着这条路走去，便会看到一个陷在地里的十字架，它在地面只剩了一英尺多，然后您向左拐，因为有四条路在陷落的十字架那儿会合；我相信，在暴风雨开始前，你们就可以得到安身之处了。”</p> 
<p>修道院长感谢了那位明智的指路人；这队人随即踢动了马，像一群指望在黑夜的暴风雨降临前赶到客店的人那样匆匆走了。</p> 
<p>在马蹄声逐渐消失后，葛四对他的同伴说道：“如果他们听从你的英明指导，这些大老爷今晚就甭想到达罗瑟伍德了。”</p> 
<p>“对，”小丑咧开嘴，露出了得意的笑容，“不过只要运气好，他们还到得了设菲尔德，这对他们也是一个合适的地方。我还不是一个这么坏的管林人，只要我不想伤害鹿，我就不会给猎狗指点鹿的藏身之处。”</p> 
<p>“你做得对，”葛四说，“不能让艾默看到罗文娜小姐，何况事情可能更坏，因为塞德里克说不定会跟这个又是修士、又是战士的家伙吵架。我们应该老老实实当我们的仆人，多听多看，但什么也别说。”</p> 
<p>现在再谈那些骑马的人，他们很快就把两个奴仆甩得远远的，在用诺曼法语进行下面的谈话了——除了少数还以撒克逊血统自豪的人以外，上层阶级通常都是使用这种语言的。</p> 
<p>“那些家伙没大没小的，毫无顾忌，他们打算干什么！”圣殿骑士对西多会修士说，“你干吗拦阻，不让我教训他们？”</p> 
<p>“算了，布里恩兄弟，”修道院长答道，“说到其中的一个，他本来是傻子，喜欢胡说八道，我跟他讲什么道理。至于另一个，那是个暴徒，这种人又野蛮又凶恶，不可理喻，正如我时常告诉你的，在被征服的撒克逊人中，这样的人还有的是，他们最喜欢干的，就是运用他们所有的一切手段，向我们这些征服者表示反感。”</p> 
<p>“我揍他几下，他就懂得礼貌了，”布里恩说，“我跟这种叛逆精神早已打惯交道。我们的土耳其俘虏也是又凶恶，又不可理喻，简直跟奥丁(注)本人一样难以驾驭；然而到了我手下，我那个管教俘虏的队长，就把他们收拾得服服贴贴，要他们怎样就怎样，一切都听你的。我说，先生，你必须警惕毒药和匕首；这种人只要你给他们一点机会，他们马上会拿起其中的一种来对付你。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)奥丁，本为北欧的神，在撒克逊人皈依基督教后，便把他看作恶魔的化身。</p> 
<p>“对，”艾默长老答道，“可是殴打这个家伙，并不能使我们知道塞德里克的住处；要知道，每个地方都有自己的风土人情，不明白这点，哪怕我们找到了他的家，你也非跟他闹翻不可。记住我说过的话：这个富裕的庄园主是傲慢、凶恶的，他恨我们，总想伺机报复，要与我们诺曼贵族对抗到底；他的邻居牛面将军雷金纳德和菲利普·马尔沃辛都不是好惹的孩子，可是即使这些人也不在他眼里。他要维护他的民族特权，态度十分坚决，又自命不凡，认为他是七国时期的著名拥护者赫里沃德(注)一脉相承的后代，因此大家普遍称他为撒克逊人塞德里克；他公然以属于这个民族自豪，尽管别人都在竭力隐瞒这种出身，免得承担‘败者遭殃’的不幸命运，蒙受被征服者的耻辱。”“艾默长老，”圣殿骑士说道，“你是一个风流人物，你对美女有深刻的研究，像行吟诗人一样熟悉一切有关爱情的事；但是我希望这个著名的罗文娜真的具有天姿国色，这才足以抵消我为了得到她必须作出的牺牲和克制，因为据你介绍，她的父亲是一个叛乱成性的暴民，为了取得他的欢心，我不得不委曲求全才成。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)赫里沃德是十一世纪盎格鲁-撒克逊人的民族英雄，曾坚决反抗征服者威廉，主张建立撒克逊人自己的国家。七国时期是公元五至八世纪七个王国在不列同时并存的时期，这七个王国全由盎格鲁-撒克逊人建立和统治。</p> 
<p>“塞德里克不是她的父亲，”院长答道，“只是她的一位远亲；她的出身甚至比他吹嘘的更高，她与他只有很远的血统关系。然而他是她的监护人，据我猜想，这是他自封的；不过他确实把这位义女看作掌上明珠，像他的亲生女儿一样。关于她的美貌，你不久就可以自己作出判断；如果她洁白的皮肤，那对温柔的蓝眼睛发出的庄严而又多情的目光，不能从你的记忆中驱逐那些梳黑辫子的巴勒斯坦姑娘，对，还有者哈里发宫中那些妖艳的女人，那么我就是个异教徒，不是教会的真正儿子。”</p> 
<p>“要是你吹嘘的那个美女，在我的天平上分量不足，那么你记得我们打的赌吧？”圣殿骑士说。</p> 
<p>“我的金项因对你的十桶希俄斯酒(注)啊，”院长回答。“它们肯定得归我所有了，我觉得好像它们已运进修道院的酒窖，给管酒库的老丹尼斯锁在屋里了。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)希俄斯酒，希腊希俄斯岛生产的名酒。</p> 
<p>“这可得我来评定，”圣殿骑士说，“只有我自己承认，从去年圣灵降临节(注)到现在，我没有见过这么漂亮的少女，我才算输了。是不是这么讲定的？院长，你的项因已发发可危啦，到了阿什口镇的比武大会上，它就得戴在我的护喉甲上了。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)圣灵降临节，基督教的重要节日之一，又称五旬节，在复活节后第五十日。</p> 
<p>“只要你赢得光明正大，给你戴自然可以，”院长说。“我相信你会作出诚实的回答，像一个骑士和教士一样心口如一。然而，老弟，听从我的劝告，管好你的舌头，说话客气一些，你在统治异教徒俘虏和东方奴隶中养成的习惯，在这儿不管用。撒克逊人塞德里克不是好惹的，你得罪了他，他绝对不会善罢甘休，你的骑士身份，我的高级职位，它们的神圣性质，都不在他的话下，他会把我们马上赶出屋子，哪怕这是在深更半夜，他也会让我们去跟云雀作伴。还有，你怎么看罗文娜也得当心。他把她当宝贝一样防备得无微不至，不让任何人多看她一眼；你一旦引起他的警觉，我们在这方面就休想有所作为了。我听说，他的独生儿子就是因为跟那位美女眉来眼去，给他从家里赶走的。看来只能远远地观看，不能靠近她，不能流露任何非分之想，就像我们在圣母马利亚的神龛前面瞻仰圣容一样。”</p> 
<p>“好啦，你讲得够了，”圣殿骑士答道，“我决定在这一夜保持必要的约束，行动像小姑娘一样文雅。不过，怕他把我们赶出屋子，那是不必要的，我和我的扈从，还有哈迈特和阿布达拉，都可以保证你绝不受到侮辱。你尽管放心，我们有足够的力量保护自己。”</p> 
<p>“但愿事情不致变得那么坏，”院长答道。“哦，这便是小丑说的陷落的十字架了，可是周围一片漆黑，简直看不清我们该走哪条路。我想，他是要我们向左转的。”</p> 
<p>“向右转，”布里恩说，“我记得清清楚楚。”</p> 
<p>“向左转，肯定是向左转；我记得，他还用木剑指了指方向呢。”</p> 
<p>“对，但他的剑虽然握在左手，指的时候却是把它横过身体向有指的，”圣殿骑士说。</p> 
<p>两人各执己见，互不相让，遇到这种情况往往如此；于是只得向随从查询，但他们离汪八远了一些，没听清他的话。最后，布里恩有了新发现，这是他在夜色中开头没察觉的：“瞧，有一个人睡在十字架脚下，不过也可能死了。休戈，用你的长矛柄捅他一下。”</p> 
<p>扈从立刻照办，那个人站了起来，用纯正的法语喊道：“不论你是谁，打扰我的好梦是不礼貌的。”</p> 
<p>“我们只是想问你一声，”院长说道，“到罗瑟伍德怎么走，我们要找撒克逊人塞德里克的住处。”</p> 
<p>“我自己也要上那儿，”陌生人答道，“如果我有马，我可以给你们当向导，因为这条路不大好找，但是我很熟悉。”</p> 
<p>“我的朋友，”院长说，“只要你把我们安全地带到那里，我会感谢你，还给你报酬的。”</p> 
<p>他吩咐一个随从骑上他牵的那匹马，把自己原来骑的马让给陌生人，以便他充当他们的向导。</p> 
<p>这人带领他们走的是另一条路，与汪八骗他们走的那条路正好相反。这条路很快就深入了森林，通过了好几条溪流，溪流两旁尽是长满水草的沼泽，这使穿越溪流变得相当危险，但是陌生人似乎凭本能知道哪里的地面最结实，哪里的渡口最安全。这样，由于他的谨慎和小心，这伙人终于顺利地走上了一条他们还没见过的较宽的林荫道。他指着林荫道末端高处一大片参差不齐的矮房子，对院长说道：“那儿便是罗瑟伍德，撒克逊人塞德里克的住处。”</p> 
<p>这对艾默长老真是个大喜讯，他本来胆子不大，在穿过那片危险的沼泽地带时一直提心吊胆，战战兢兢，以致没有心思向带路人提出任何问题。现在他觉得轻松了，离宿处不远了，他的好奇心开始苏醒，于是向这位向导打听他是谁，是干什么的。</p> 
<p>他答说他是“一个朝圣者，刚从圣地回来”。</p> 
<p>“你应该留在那里，为收复圣墓战斗，”圣殿骑士说。</p> 
<p>“讲得对，尊敬的骑士阁下，”朝圣者回答，他看来对圣殿骑士的装束相当熟悉。“不过，既然那些曾经宣誓要为收复圣城战斗的人，可以跑到离他们的职守这么远的地方来，像我这么一个和平的农夫不想履行他们撇下的任务，这又有什么值得惊异的呢？”</p> 
<p>圣殿骑士听了很生气，正想骂他几句、但给修道院长拦住了，后者再度表示，他们的向导长时间外出之后，仍对森林中的道路了如指掌，令他十分钦佩。</p> 
<p>“我是出生在这一带的，”向导答道。在他回答时，他们已来到塞德里克的大院前面，那是一群低矮而不规则的建筑物，分布在相当辽阔的土地上，其中包含着几个庭院或用场；它的规模说明这是一个大户人家，但它与诺曼贵族居住的、塔楼围绕的城堡式高大建筑，又截然不同，尽管后者在英国已到处可见，成了流行的建筑式样。</p> 
<p>然而罗瑟伍德也不是毫无防御设备；在那个动乱的时代，没有一所住宅会甘冒风险，不怕在一夜之间给洗劫一空，夷为平地的。一条深坑或壕沟，环绕在全部房屋周围，其中灌满了从附近河道中引入的水流。壕沟的内外两边都围了篱墙或木栅，它们全用尖头柱子组成，木材取自邻近的森林。西边有一个人口穿越外层木栅，经过吊桥与内层篱墙上相似的缺口沟通。为了防备万一，这些入口都处在突出的角塔的保护下，必要时弓箭手或弹弓手可以从侧翼进行狙击。</p> 
<p>在这个入口前面，圣殿骑士吹响了嘹亮的号音，因为早已威胁着这一带的暴雨，现在已开始哗啦哗啦的倾泻而下了。</p>
