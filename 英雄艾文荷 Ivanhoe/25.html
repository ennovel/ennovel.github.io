Two Gentlemen of Verona</p> 
<p>The apartment to which the Lady Rowena had been introduced was fitted up with some rude attempts at ornament and magnificence, and her being placed there might be considered as a peculiar mark of respect not offered to the other prisoners. But the wife of Front-de-Boeuf, for whom it had been originally furnished, was long dead, and decay and neglect had impaired the few ornaments with which her taste had adorned it. The tapestry hung down from the walls in many places, and in others was tarnished and faded under the effects of the sun, or tattered and decayed by age. Desolate, however, as it was, this was the apartment of the castle which had been judged most fitting for the accommodation of the Saxon heiress; and here she was left to meditate upon her fate, until the actors in this nefarious drama had arranged the several parts which each of them was to perform. This had been settled in a council held by Front-de-Boeuf, De Bracy, and the Templar, in which, after a long and warm debate concerning the several advantages which each insisted upon deriving from his peculiar share in this audacious enterprise, they had at length determined the fate of their unhappy prisoners.</p> 
<p>It was about the hour of noon, therefore, when De Bracy, for whose advantage the expedition had been first planned, appeared to prosecute his views upon the hand and possessions of the Lady Rowena.</p> 
<p>The interval had not entirely been bestowed in holding council with his confederates, for De Bracy had found leisure to decorate his person with all the foppery of the times. His green cassock and vizard were now flung aside. His long luxuriant hair was trained to flow in quaint tresses down his richly furred cloak. His beard was closely shaved, his doublet reached to the middle of his leg, and the girdle which secured it, and at the same time supported his ponderous sword, was embroidered and embossed with gold work. We have already noticed the extravagant fashion of the shoes at this period, and the points of Maurice de Bracy's might have challenged the prize of extravagance with the gayest, being turned up and twisted like the horns of a ram. Such was the dress of a gallant of the period; and, in the present instance, that effect was aided by the handsome person and good demeanour of the wearer, whose manners partook alike of the grace of a courtier, and the frankness of a soldier.</p> 
<p>He saluted Rowena by doffing his velvet bonnet, garnished with a golden broach, representing St Michael trampling down the Prince of Evil. With this, he gently motioned the lady to a seat; and, as she still retained her standing posture, the knight ungloved his right hand, and motioned to conduct her thither. But Rowena declined, by her gesture, the proffered compliment, and replied, "If I be in the presence of my jailor, Sir Knight---nor will circumstances allow me to think otherwise---it best becomes his prisoner to remain standing till she learns her doom."</p> 
<p>"Alas! fair Rowena," returned De Bracy, "you are in presence of your captive, not your jailor; and it is from your fair eyes that De Bracy must receive that doom which you fondly expect from him."</p> 
<p>"I know you not, sir," said the lady, drawing herself up with all the pride of offended rank and beauty; "I know you not---and the insolent familiarity with which you apply to me the jargon of a troubadour, forms no apology for the violence of a robber."</p> 
<p>"To thyself, fair maid," answered De Bracy, in his former tone ---"to thine own charms be ascribed whate'er I have done which passed the respect due to her, whom I have chosen queen of my heart, and lodestar of my eyes."</p> 
<p>"I repeat to you, Sir Knight, that I know you not, and that no man wearing chain and spurs ought thus to intrude himself upon the presence of an unprotected lady."</p> 
<p>"That I am unknown to you," said De Bracy, "is indeed my misfortune; yet let me hope that De Bracy's name has not been always unspoken, when minstrels or heralds have praised deeds of chivalry, whether in the lists or in the battle-field."</p> 
<p>"To heralds and to minstrels, then, leave thy praise, Sir Knight," replied Rowena, "more suiting for their mouths than for thine own; and tell me which of them shall record in song, or in book of tourney, the memorable conquest of this night, a conquest obtained over an old man, followed by a few timid hinds; and its booty, an unfortunate maiden, transported against her will to the castle of a robber?"</p> 
<p>"You are unjust, Lady Rowena," said the knight, biting his lips in some confusion, and speaking in a tone more natural to him than that of affected gallantry, which he had at first adopted; "yourself free from passion, you can allow no excuse for the frenzy of another, although caused by your own beauty."</p> 
<p>"I pray you, Sir Knight," said Rowena, "to cease a language so commonly used by strolling minstrels, that it becomes not the mouth of knights or nobles. Certes, you constrain me to sit down, since you enter upon such commonplace terms, of which each vile crowder hath a stock that might last from hence to Christmas."</p> 
<p>"Proud damsel," said De Bracy, incensed at finding his gallant style procured him nothing but contempt---"proud damsel, thou shalt be as proudly encountered. Know then, that I have supported my pretensions to your hand in the way that best suited thy character. It is meeter for thy humour to be wooed with bow and bill, than in set terms, and in courtly language."</p> 
<p>"Courtesy of tongue," said Rowena, "when it is used to veil churlishness of deed, is but a knight's girdle around the breast of a base clown. I wonder not that the restraint appears to gall you---more it were for your honour to have retained the dress and language of an outlaw, than to veil the deeds of one under an affectation of gentle language and demeanour."</p> 
<p>"You counsel well, lady," said the Norman; "and in the bold language which best justifies bold action I tell thee, thou shalt never leave this castle, or thou shalt leave it as Maurice de Bracy's wife. I am not wont to be baffled in my enterprises, nor needs a Norman noble scrupulously to vindicate his conduct to the Saxon maiden whom he distinguishes by the offer of his hand. Thou art proud, Rowena, and thou art the fitter to be my wife. By what other means couldst thou be raised to high honour and to princely place, saving by my alliance? How else wouldst thou escape from the mean precincts of a country grange, where Saxons herd with the swine which form their wealth, to take thy seat, honoured as thou shouldst be, and shalt be, amid all in England that is distinguished by beauty, or dignified by power?"</p> 
<p>"Sir Knight," replied Rowena, "the grange which you contemn hath been my shelter from infancy; and, trust me, when I leave it ---should that day ever arrive---it shall be with one who has not learnt to despise the dwelling and manners in which I have been brought up."</p> 
<p>"I guess your meaning, lady," said De Bracy, "though you may think it lies too obscure for my apprehension. But dream not, that Richard Coeur de Lion will ever resume his throne, far less that Wilfred of Ivanhoe, his minion, will ever lead thee to his footstool, to be there welcomed as the bride of a favourite. Another suitor might feel jealousy while he touched this string; but my firm purpose cannot be changed by a passion so childish and so hopeless. Know, lady, that this rival is in my power, and that it rests but with me to betray the secret of his being within the castle to Front-de-Boeuf, whose jealousy will be more fatal than mine."</p> 
<p>"Wilfred here?" said Rowena, in disdain; "that is as true as that Front-de-Boeuf is his rival."</p> 
<p>De Bracy looked at her steadily for an instant.</p> 
<p>"Wert thou really ignorant of this?" said he; "didst thou not know that Wilfred of Ivanhoe travelled in the litter of the Jew? ---a meet conveyance for the crusader, whose doughty arm was to reconquer the Holy Sepulchre!" And he laughed scornfully.</p> 
<p>"And if he is here," said Rowena, compelling herself to a tone of indifference, though trembling with an agony of apprehension which she could not suppress, "in what is he the rival of Front-de-Boeuf? or what has he to fear beyond a short imprisonment, and an honourable ransom, according to the use of chivalry?"</p> 
<p>"Rowena," said De Bracy, "art thou, too, deceived by the common error of thy sex, who think there can be no rivalry but that respecting their own charms? Knowest thou not there is a jealousy of ambition and of wealth, as well as of love; and that this our host, Front-de-Boeuf, will push from his road him who opposes his claim to the fair barony of Ivanhoe, as readily, eagerly, and unscrupulously, as if he were preferred to him by some blue-eyed damsel? But smile on my suit, lady, and the wounded champion shall have nothing to fear from Front-de-Boeuf, whom else thou mayst mourn for, as in the hands of one who has never shown compassion."</p> 
<p>"Save him, for the love of Heaven!" said Rowena, her firmness giving way under terror for her lover's impending fate.</p> 
<p>"I can---I will---it is my purpose," said De Bracy; "for, when Rowena consents to be the bride of De Bracy, who is it shall dare to put forth a violent hand upon her kinsman---the son of her guardian---the companion of her youth? But it is thy love must buy his protection. I am not romantic fool enough to further the fortune, or avert the fate, of one who is likely to be a successful obstacle between me and my wishes. Use thine influence with me in his behalf, and he is safe,---refuse to employ it, Wilfred dies, and thou thyself art not the nearer to freedom."</p> 
<p>"Thy language," answered Rowena, "hath in its indifferent bluntness something which cannot be reconciled with the horrors it seems to express. I believe not that thy purpose is so wicked, or thy power so great."</p> 
<p>"Flatter thyself, then, with that belief," said De Bracy, "until time shall prove it false. Thy lover lies wounded in this castle ---thy preferred lover. He is a bar betwixt Front-de-Boeuf and that which Front-de-Boeuf loves better than either ambition or beauty. What will it cost beyond the blow of a poniard, or the thrust of a javelin, to silence his opposition for ever? Nay, were Front-de-Boeuf afraid to justify a deed so open, let the leech but give his patient a wrong draught---let the chamberlain, or the nurse who tends him, but pluck the pillow from his head, and Wilfred in his present condition, is sped without the effusion of blood. Cedric also---"</p> 
<p>"And Cedric also," said Rowena, repeating his words; "my noble ---my generous guardian! I deserved the evil I have encountered, for forgetting his fate even in that of his son!"</p> 
<p>"Cedric's fate also depends upon thy determination," said De Bracy; "and I leave thee to form it."</p> 
<p>Hitherto, Rowena had sustained her part in this trying scene with undismayed courage, but it was because she had not considered the danger as serious and imminent. Her disposition was naturally that which physiognomists consider as proper to fair complexions, mild, timid, and gentle; but it had been tempered, and, as it were, hardened, by the circumstances of her education. Accustomed to see the will of all, even of Cedric himself, (sufficiently arbitrary with others,) give way before her wishes, she had acquired that sort of courage and self-confidence which arises from the habitual and constant deference of the circle in which we move. She could scarce conceive the possibility of her will being opposed, far less that of its being treated with total disregard.</p> 
<p>Her haughtiness and habit of domination was, therefore, a fictitious character, induced over that which was natural to her, and it deserted her when her eyes were opened to the extent of her own danger, as well as that of her lover and her guardian; and when she found her will, the slightest expression of which was wont to command respect and attention, now placed in opposition to that of a man of a strong, fierce, and determined mind, who possessed the advantage over her, and was resolved to use it, she quailed before him.</p> 
<p>After casting her eyes around, as if to look for the aid which was nowhere to be found, and after a few broken interjections, she raised her hands to heaven, and burst into a passion of uncontrolled vexation and sorrow. It was impossible to see so beautiful a creature in such extremity without feeling for her, and De Bracy was not unmoved, though he was yet more embarrassed than touched. He had, in truth, gone too far to recede; and yet, in Rowena's present condition, she could not be acted on either by argument or threats. He paced the apartment to and fro, now vainly exhorting the terrified maiden to compose herself, now hesitating concerning his own line of conduct.</p> 
<p>If, thought he, I should be moved by the tears and sorrow of this disconsolate damsel, what should I reap but the loss of these fair hopes for which I have encountered so much risk, and the ridicule of Prince John and his jovial comrades? "And yet," he said to himself, "I feel myself ill framed for the part which I am playing. I cannot look on so fair a face while it is disturbed with agony, or on those eyes when they are drowned in tears. I would she had retained her original haughtiness of disposition, or that I had a larger share of Front-de-Boeuf's thrice-tempered hardness of heart!"</p> 
<p>Agitated by these thoughts, he could only bid the unfortunate Rowena be comforted, and assure her, that as yet she had no reason for the excess of despair to which she was now giving way. But in this task of consolation De Bracy was interrupted by the horn, "hoarse-winded blowing far and keen," which had at the same time alarmed the other inmates of the castle, and interrupted their several plans of avarice and of license. Of them all, perhaps, De Bracy least regretted the interruption; for his conference with the Lady Rowena had arrived at a point, where he found it equally difficult to prosecute or to resign his enterprise.</p> 
<p>And here we cannot but think it necessary to offer some better proof than the incidents of an idle tale, to vindicate the melancholy representation of manners which has been just laid before the reader. It is grievous to think that those valiant barons, to whose stand against the crown the liberties of England were indebted for their existence, should themselves have been such dreadful oppressors, and capable of excesses contrary not only to the laws of England, but to those of nature and humanity. But, alas! we have only to extract from the industrious Henry one of those numerous passages which he has collected from contemporary historians, to prove that fiction itself can hardly reach the dark reality of the horrors of the period.</p> 
<p>The description given by the author of the Saxon Chronicle of the cruelties exercised in the reign of King Stephen by the great barons and lords of castles, who were all Normans, affords a strong proof of the excesses of which they were capable when their passions were inflamed. "They grievously oppressed the poor people by building castles; and when they were built, they filled them with wicked men, or rather devils, who seized both men and women who they imagined had any money, threw them into prison, and put them to more cruel tortures than the martyrs ever endured. They suffocated some in mud, and suspended others by the feet, or the head, or the thumbs, kindling fires below them. They squeezed the heads of some with knotted cords till they pierced their brains, while they threw others into dungeons swarming with serpents, snakes, and toads." But it would be cruel to put the reader to the pain of perusing the remainder of this description.*</p>

<p>As another instance of these bitter fruits of conquest, and perhaps the strongest that can be quoted, we may mention, that the Princess Matilda, though a daughter of the King of Scotland, and afterwards both Queen of England, niece to Edgar Atheling, and mother to the Empress of Germany, the daughter, the wife, and the mother of monarchs, was obliged, during her early residence for education in England, to assume the veil of a nun, as the only means of escaping the licentious pursuit of the Norman nobles. This excuse she stated before a great council of the clergy of England, as the sole reason for her having taken the religious habit. The assembled clergy admitted the validity of the plea, and the notoriety of the circumstances upon which it was founded; giving thus an indubitable and most remarkable testimony to the existence of that disgraceful license by which that age was stained. It was a matter of public knowledge, they said, that after the conquest of King William, his Norman followers, elated by so great a victory, acknowledged no law but their own wicked pleasure, and not only despoiled the conquered Saxons of their lands and their goods, but invaded the honour of their wives and of their daughters with the most unbridled license; and hence it was then common for matrons and maidens of noble families to assume the veil, and take shelter in convents, not as called thither by the vocation of God, but solely to preserve their honour from the unbridled wickedness of man.</p> 
<p>Such and so licentious were the times, as announced by the public declaration of the assembled clergy, recorded by Eadmer; and we need add nothing more to vindicate the probability of the scenes which we have detailed, and are about to detail, upon the more apocryphal authority of the Wardour MS.</p>

<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)莎士比亚的喜剧，引文见该剧第五幕第四场。</p> 
<p>罗文娜小姐给带进了一间屋子，它的陈设虽然简陋，但还是显得比别的房间奢侈和豪华一些，她被安置在这里，可以认为她与其他囚犯不同，得到了特殊的尊敬。它本来是为牛面将军的妻子布置的，但是她很早就死了，按照她的爱好设置的一些装饰品，由于无人照料，已经陈旧和毁坏。壁毯在许多地方从墙上挂了下来，有的则在日光的照射下变得暗淡和褪色了，还有的在时间的侵蚀下破损和腐烂了。然而尽管显得有些凄凉，这间屋子还是被评定为最适合撒克逊女继承人居住的；现在她便独自待在这里，思考着自己的命运，等待那些在这出凶险的戏剧中扮演各类角色的演员粉墨登场。这已由牛面将军、德布拉西和圣殿骑士三入开会商定了，在会议中，他们经过长时间的热烈争论，对各人在这场横行不法的行动中应该取得的特殊利益，提出了自己的看法，最后决定了那些不幸的俘虏的命运。</p> 
<p>这样，到了中午前后，德布拉西这位最早策划这次行动的角色，前来面见罗文娜小姐，要把娶她为妻，从而取得她的财产的计划，付诸实施了。</p> 
<p>在这段时间里，他除了与他的同党密谋策划以外，已抽空按照当时纨绔子弟的标准，把自己打扮得焕然一新。他的绿大褂和面罩现在已给丢在一旁。他那又长又密的头发编成了一绺绺漂亮的鬈发，披在豪华的皮外套上。他的胡须剃光了，紧身上衣达到了腿弯那儿，腰里束着一条用嵌金工艺制作的绣花腰带，带子上挂着一把笨重的大剑。我们已经讲过这个时期靴子的时髦式样，莫里斯·德布拉西的鞋类更是登峰造极，可以在奢华比赛中名列前茅，它高高翘起，跟一对羊角差不多。这是当时美男子的装束，在目前这场合，由于穿戴者的漂亮身材和优美举止，更显得不同寻常，使这个人变得风流倜傥，既带有大臣的华贵气质，又具有军人的爽朗风度。</p> 
<p>他一见罗文娜，便摘下了丝绒帽子；帽上装饰的一枚金别针，表现了圣米迦勒(注)把魔王踹踏在脚下的图形。他拿着帽子，温文尔雅地做了个手势，请小姐坐下；由于她仍站在那里，骑士脱下右边的手套，打算扶她到那儿就坐。但罗文娜用手势拒绝了他的殷勤表示，回答道：“如果站在我面前的是我的狱卒——骑士先生，情况也不允许我作别的设想——那么最好让他的囚犯站着听取对她的判决。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)《圣经》中的天使长，《启示录》第12章说：“米迦勒与龙争战……那龙名叫魔鬼，又叫撒旦，是迷惑普天下的，他被摔在地上……”</p> 
<p>“暧呀！美丽的罗文娜，”德布拉西答道，“站在你面前的不是你的狱卒，是你的俘虏；他到这里来，不是像你那句戏言所说的要对你作出判决，是要从你那对美丽的眼睛中看到你对德布拉西的判决。”</p> 
<p>“我不认识你，先生，”小姐说，挺直身子，表现了她的身分和美貌不允许侵犯的自尊心，“我不认识你；你用流浪歌人的粗俗语言向我讲的话，只是流露了你的无礼和放肆，这不能为强盗的暴行开脱罪责。”</p> 
<p>“美丽的小姐，”德布拉西回答，仍是刚才的口气，“那是你的花容月貌，才使我对我心目中的女王和北极星，做出了不够尊敬的越轨行为。”</p> 
<p>“我向你再说一遍，骑士先生，我不认识你；任何一个身上穿盔甲、脚上有踢马刺的人，都不应该闯到一个无人保护的妇女面前，跟她纠缠。”</p> 
<p>“你不认识我，这确实是我的不幸，”德布拉西说，“但我相信，不论在比武场上还是战场上，德布拉西的名字不是没有得到过行吟诗人或典礼官的歌颂的。”</p> 
<p>“那么还是让行吟诗人或典礼官去歌颂你吧，骑士先生，”罗文娜答道，“这在他们嘴里比在你自己嘴里合适一些。那么请问，昨天夜里那次难忘的征讨，对一个老人和几个胆小的家丁的征讨，以及这次征讨的成果——一个不幸的少女被强行劫持到强盗的城堡中这件事，应该由行吟诗人编入诗歌中，还是由典礼官记录到比武大会的案卷中呢？’”</p> 
<p>“你并不公正，罗文娜小姐，”骑士说，有些尴尬，因此咬紧了嘴唇，讲话的声音也自然了一些，不像起先那么装得温柔多情了。“你自己冷若冰霜，便不承认别人的热恋有存在的权利，尽管这只是你的美貌引起的。”</p> 
<p>“对不起，骑士先生，”罗文娜说，“请你庄重一些，不要用江湖艺人的陈词烂调，这对骑士或贵族都是不恰当的。确实，你使我不得不坐下了，因为你跟我搬弄这些无聊的废话，这是每个夸夸其谈的小丑都会讲个不停，从现在一直讲到圣诞节的。”</p> 
<p>“你是一个傲慢的女子，”德布拉西说，有些生气，发现他的殷勤只是换来了羞辱，“对一个傲慢的女子，必须用傲慢的态度对付她。现在告诉你，我有办法叫你嫁给我，这办法对你是最合适的。从你的脾气看，用弓箭和刀剑向你求婚，比用日常的词汇和文雅的语言更有效。”</p> 
<p>“文雅的语言在用来掩盖粗俗的行为时，”罗文娜说，“只是把骑士的腰带束在卑鄙的小人身上。因此难怪你觉得拘束，不自然；你还不如老老实实，保留强盗的衣衫和语言好一些，不必用故作多情的言辞和举止掩盖强盗的行径。”</p> 
<p>“你的劝告很好，小姐，”诺曼人说。“只有大胆的语言才理直气壮，可以说明大胆的行动，那么我告诉你，你休想走出这个城堡，除非你成为莫里斯·德布拉西的妻子。我要做的事，谁也阻挡不住，而且一个诺曼贵族既然打定主意，要娶一个撒克逊女子，这是抬举她，用不到低声下气说明理由。你很骄傲，罗文娜，这使你更适合作我的妻子。请问，你除了与我结婚，还有什么其他办法可以爬上这么光荣、这么高贵的位置？可以脱离你那个乡下庄园的狭窄天地？你们撒克逊人是跟猪生活在一起的，猪便是他们的财产，你只有嫁给我，才能享受荣华富贵，才能进入英国的一切名媛淑女和权门显贵之间，这难道还不清楚吗？”</p> 
<p>“骑士先生，”罗文娜答道，“你所不屑一顾的乡下农庄是我从小居住的地方，我可以告诉你，假如真有一天我要离开它，那么带我离开它的人，必然是从不鄙视我从小生长的那个环境和那种生活的。”</p> 
<p>“我明白你的意思，小姐，”德布拉西说，“尽管你可能认为这十分隐晦，我不会猜到。但是不要幻想狮心王理查还会东山再起，更不要幻想，他的亲信艾文荷的威尔弗莱德还会带你去叩见他，他还会像欢迎他的宠臣的新娘那么欢迎你。接触到这个问题，别的求婚者可能会感到嫉妒，但是我的意志是坚定的，我不会把这种儿戏般的、没有希望的恋情放在心上。告诉你，小姐，这位情敌现在掌握在我的手中，我是否向牛面将军透露他在城堡内的秘密，这取决于我，要知道，牛面将军是比我更可怕的一个敌人。”</p> 
<p>“威尔弗莱德在这里！”罗文娜用轻蔑的口气说，“对，这就像牛面将军是他的仇敌一样真实！”</p> 
<p>德布拉西盯住她看了一会。“你真的不知道这件事？”他说，“你不知道艾文荷的威尔弗莱德躺在犹太人的驮舆中旅行？——一个十字军战上躺在这样的交通工具中，还自命不凡，想凭他的胳臂夺回圣墓！”他发出了奚落的大笑声。</p> 
<p>“就算他在这儿吧，”罗文娜尽管忧心忡忡，无法抑制内心的痛苦，还是强迫自己用冷漠的口气卜这么，“他又怎么会成为个面将军的仇敌呢？他只要按照骑士制度的规矩，缴纳一笔公正的赎金，便可获得释放，他有什么需要担心的呢？”</p> 
<p>“罗文娜，”德布拉西说，“这真是妇人之见，是你们经常犯的错误；难道除了你们的美色，就没有东西会引起男人之间的仇恨了吗？你可知道，除了争夺爱情，世上还有权力之争和财富之争？我们这个主人牛面将军，为了保留他对那块富饶的领地艾文荷的权利，可以毫不迟疑、不顾一切、不择手段地铲除任何阻碍他实现这意图的绊脚石，就像争夺一个蓝眼睛的女人一样。但是，小姐，只要你答应我的要求，那个负伤的勇士就不必怕牛面将军对他下毒手，你也不必担心他会落进这个从来不知道同情的敌人手中。”</p> 
<p>“看在仁慈的上帝份上，救救他吧！”罗文娜喊道，在她的情人面临的命运的威胁下，她的决心动摇了。</p> 
<p>“我能够也愿意这么做，这本来是我的打算，”德布拉西说，“因为在罗文娜同意成为德布拉西的新娘后，谁还敢把粗暴的手伸向她的亲属——她的监护人的儿子，她少年时代的同伴？但是你必须用你的爱情购买对他的保护。我不是浪漫的傻瓜，不会帮助一个可能在我和我的要求之间构成障碍的人，让他称心如意，获得成功。你肯为他运用对我的影响力，他便可以得救；如果你拒绝这么做，威尔弗莱德便死定了，你自己也会离自由越来越远。”</p> 
<p>“你的话显得满不在乎，狂妄自大，”罗文娜答道，“我觉得，这与它所表达的罪恶意图不能协议。我不相信你的用心这么险恶，或者你的力量这么大。”</p> 
<p>“那么随你怎么想吧，”德布拉西说，“时间会证明你的想法错了。你的情人受了伤，躺在这城堡内——他是你的心上人。但他也是横亘在牛面将军和他的封地之间的障碍，这片封地在牛面将军看来，是比权力和美女更重要的。这并不费事，只要一月或者一枪，就可以永远解决，使他不再成为障碍。假定牛面将军不敢公开这么干，那就让医生给病人服一帖毒药，让管家或侍候他的使女，抽掉他的枕头，这样，处在目前这种状况的威尔弗莱德不用流一滴血，马上会一命呜呼。还有塞德里克……”</p> 
<p>“还有塞德里克……”罗文娜跟着说道，“我高贵的、慷慨的监护人！我只记得他的儿子，却忘记了他，我真是罪有应得！”</p> 
<p>“塞德里克的命运也得看你怎么决定，”德布拉西说，“这全在于你。”</p> 
<p>这以前，罗文娜在困难的处境中，一直保持着毫不畏缩的勇气，但那是因为她没有想到危险这么严重，这么不叮阻挡。她的性情本来是相面先生认为白嫩的皮肤应有的那种——温柔，羞怯，文雅；只是经过环境的熏陶之后，显得有些刚强罢了。她习惯于看到，大家的意愿，甚至塞德里克本人的意愿——尽管他对别人是相当专横武断的——都在她的要求面前屈服，因而获得了那种勇气和自信，这是我们生活的那个圈子经常给予我们的尊敬造成的。她很难想象，她的愿望会遭到拒绝，对它完全不予理会．更是绝不可能的。</p> 
<p>因此她的傲慢和支配一切的习惯，只是一种虚构的性格，蒙在她的天性上的一层表皮，当她一旦睁开眼睛，看到她本人，以及她的情人和监护人，所面临的危险如何深重时，那层虚假的外表便消失了。她发现，她的意志本来只要略有表示，便会得到尊重和关心，现在却遇到了一个强大、残忍、坚定的人的抵制，他掌握了对她的有利条件，而巨决定利用这条件达到自己的目的，于是她在他面前退缩了。</p> 
<p>她抬起头向周围打量了一下，似乎想寻找帮助，却无法找到，于是断断续续发出几声叹息后，她举起双手，在无法克制的烦恼和忧郁中放声痛哭了。看到这么漂亮的一个人陷入这样的绝望中，对她毫不同情是不可能的，德布拉西也不会无动于衷，尽管他主要还是感到困惑，不是感动。确实，他已走得太远，无法退却了，然而按照罗文娜目前的状况，劝说和威胁对她都没有用。他在屋里踱来踱去，一会儿对胆战心惊的少女讲几句徒劳无益的劝告，一会儿思前想后，踌躇不决，考虑他应该采取的方针。</p> 
<p>“如果我被这个郁郁不乐的女子的眼泪和苦恼打动了，”他想，“那么我岂不前功尽弃，只得把冒了这么多危险想取得的美好希望丢在一边，忍受约翰亲王和他那班酒肉朋友的耻笑了吗？然而，”他又对自己说，“我觉得我大生不是扮演这种角色的人。我不能眼看这么漂亮的一张脸蛋变得如此愁容满面，这么一对眼睛淹没在泪水中。我宁可她还保持着原来那副盛气凌人的脸色，或者我能像牛面将军一样，生着一颗冷酷无情的心！”</p> 
<p>这些思想把他搅得心烦意乱，只能要求罗文娜别太伤心，他向她保证，她还没有完全绝望，不必这么灰心丧气。但是德布拉西的这些安慰被一二阵阵号角声打断了，这就是城堡内的其他人也听到的、打断了他们各种贪婪而荒谬的计划的那声“惊天动地的豪迈的号角声”。也许在所有这些人中，德布拉西是最欢迎它的到来的，因为对他的计划，他既无法推进，又不肯放弃，他与罗文娜小姐的谈判已陷入死胡同了。</p> 
<p>说到这里，我们认为，除了书中这些查无实据的故事以外，必须对读者刚才看到的时代风貌的悲惨表现，提供一些更好的证明了。这是一个不幸的事实：尽管英国的各种自由权利，是多寸一些英勇的贵族面对国王据理力争，才得以实现的，他们自己却也是骇人听闻的压迫者，他们的暴虐行径不仅违背英国的法律，也为天理人情所不容。是的！我们只要从勤奋的亨利(注)的书中，把他搜集的当时历史学家多不胜数的记载中，摘取一段，便足以证明，小说的描写与当时黑暗可怕的现实相比，还膛乎其后。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)即指亨廷顿的亨利、见卷首《劳伦斯·坦普尔顿致德赖斯达斯特博士的信》。</p> 
<p>《撒克逊编年史》作者的叙述，为斯蒂芬国王统治时期大贵族和大官僚的暴行，提供了有力的证据；这些人全是诺曼人，他们一旦动怒，简直可以无所不为。“他们为了建造城堡，肆无忌惮地欺压贫民百姓。城堡建成后，又把它们交给无恶不作的、可以说与魔鬼不相上下的人管理，凡是这些人认为有一点钱的，不论男女，都给抓进城堡，关在牢里严刑拷打，甚至超过了对殉教者所用过的酷刑。有的人给他们丢在污泥中闷死，有的给吊住脚、头或拇指，然后在他们下面点上火烧死。有的给打结的绳索勒紧脑袋，直至脑浆迸裂，也有的给会进充满各种毒蛇和爬虫的土坑中。”但是让读者阅读这样的记载是残忍的，因此其余部分只得省略了。(注)</p>

<p>关于诺曼人征服英国造成的不幸后果，我们还可以举一个例子，也许这是最触目惊心的，那就是玛蒂尔达皇后(注)的遭遇，她虽然是苏格兰国王的女儿，后来又成了英国的王后和神圣罗马帝国的皇后，但这个先后作过国王的女儿、妻子和母后的人，在她早年为了求学留居英国时，却不得不戴上面纱，扮作修女，才能躲避诺曼贵族的戏弄和侮辱。这个权宜措施，她曾向英国主教会议作过陈述，因为这是她采用教会服饰的唯一理由。参加会议的教士一致认为，她的理由是充足的，作为它所根据的那些情况也是众所周知的；这件事便是一个不容置疑、无可否认的证据，说明当时的风气败坏已到了多么严重的程度。他们说，这已是公认的事实：威廉国王征服英国后，他的诺曼部下陶醉在伟大的胜利中，不承认任何法律，一切得服从他们寻欢作乐的需要；他们不仅掠夺被征服的撒克逊人的土地和财产，而且不顾他们的妻子和女儿的荣誉，肆意凌辱她们，以致那些贵族家庭的主妇和闺女戴上面纱，在那时已司空见惯，她们寄身于修道院中，不是为了崇敬上帝，唯一的原因只是为了保持自身的贞洁，免遭男人肆无忌惮的蹂躏。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)玛蒂尔达是苏格兰国王马尔科姆三世的女儿，于1100年嫁给英国国工亨利一世为王后，但她没有作过神圣罗马帝国的皇后。她的女儿出生于1102年，也名玛蒂尔达，早年即嫁给神圣罗马帝国皇帝亨利五世，亨利五世死后，她返回英国，与国王斯蒂芬争夺三位，后来两人达成协议，由她的儿子亨利继承王位，是为亨利二世。这里可能是作者把两个玛蒂尔达混为一谈了。</p> 
<p>确实，这是一个胡作非为的时代，正如那些参加会议的教士所一致公认的那样，他们的话已由埃德默(注)记录在案，不必我们再多费笔墨，依靠不足凭信的《沃杜尔文稿》来证明我们所描写的，以及即将描写的那些情节的真实性了。</p>
