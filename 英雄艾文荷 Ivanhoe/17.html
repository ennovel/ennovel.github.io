<p>No spider ever took more pains to repair the shattered meshes of his web, than did Waldemar Fitzurse to reunite and combine the scattered members of Prince John's cabal. Few of these were attached to him from inclination, and none from personal regard. It was therefore necessary, that Fitzurse should open to them new prospects of advantage, and remind them of those which they at present enjoyed. To the young and wild nobles, he held out the prospect of unpunished license and uncontrolled revelry; to the ambitious, that of power, and to the covetous, that of increased wealth and extended domains. The leaders of the mercenaries received a donation in gold; an argument the most persuasive to their minds, and without which all others would have proved in vain. Promises were still more liberally distributed than money by this active agent; and, in fine, nothing was left undone that could determine the wavering, or animate the disheartened. The return of King Richard he spoke of as an event altogether beyond the reach of probability; yet, when he observed, from the doubtful looks and uncertain answers which he received, that this was the apprehension by which the minds of his accomplices were most haunted, he boldly treated that event, should it really take place, as one which ought not to alter their political calculations.</p> 
<p>"If Richard returns," said Fitzurse, "he returns to enrich his needy and impoverished crusaders at the expense of those who did not follow him to the Holy Land. He returns to call to a fearful reckoning, those who, during his absence, have done aught that can be construed offence or encroachment upon either the laws of the land or the privileges of the crown. He returns to avenge upon the Orders of the Temple and the Hospital, the preference which they showed to Philip of France during the wars in the Holy Land. He returns, in fine, to punish as a rebel every adherent of his brother Prince John. Are ye afraid of his power?" continued the artful confident of that Prince, "we acknowledge him a strong and valiant knight; but these are not the days of King Arthur, when a champion could encounter an army. If Richard indeed comes back, it must be alone,---unfollowed---unfriended. The bones of his gallant army have whitened the sands of Palestine. The few of his followers who have returned have straggled hither like this Wilfred of Ivanhoe, beggared and broken men.---And what talk ye of Richard's right of birth?" he proceeded, in answer to those who objected scruples on that head. "Is Richard's title of primogeniture more decidedly certain than that of Duke Robert of Normandy, the Conqueror's eldest son? And yet William the Red, and Henry, his second and third brothers, were successively preferred to him by the voice of the nation, Robert had every merit which can be pleaded for Richard; he was a bold knight, a good leader, generous to his friends and to the church, and, to crown the whole, a crusader and a conqueror of the Holy Sepulchre; and yet he died a blind and miserable prisoner in the Castle of Cardiff, because he opposed himself to the will of the people, who chose that he should not rule over them. It is our right," he said, "to choose from the blood royal the prince who is best qualified to hold the supreme power ---that is," said he, correcting himself, "him whose election will best promote the interests of the nobility. In personal qualifications," he added, "it was possible that Prince John might be inferior to his brother Richard; but when it was considered that the latter returned with the sword of vengeance in his hand, while the former held out rewards, immunities, privileges, wealth, and honours, it could not be doubted which was the king whom in wisdom the nobility were called on to support."</p> 
<p>These, and many more arguments, some adapted to the peculiar circumstances of those whom he addressed, had the expected weight with the nobles of Prince John's faction. Most of them consented to attend the proposed meeting at York, for the purpose of making general arrangements for placing the crown upon the head of Prince John.</p> 
<p>It was late at night, when, worn out and exhausted with his various exertions, however gratified with the result, Fitzurse, returning to the Castle of Ashby, met with De Bracy, who had exchanged his banqueting garments for a short green kirtle, with hose of the same cloth and colour, a leathern cap or head-piece, a short sword, a horn slung over his shoulder, a long bow in his hand, and a bundle of arrows stuck in his belt. Had Fitzurse met this figure in an outer apartment, he would have passed him without notice, as one of the yeomen of the guard; but finding him in the inner hall, he looked at him with more attention, and recognised the Norman knight in the dress of an English yeoman.</p> 
<p>"What mummery is this, De Bracy?" said Fitzurse, somewhat angrily; "is this a time for Christmas gambols and quaint maskings, when the fate of our master, Prince John, is on the very verge of decision? Why hast thou not been, like me, among these heartless cravens, whom the very name of King Richard terrifies, as it is said to do the children of the Saracens?"</p> 
<p>"I have been attending to mine own business," answered De Bracy calmly, "as you, Fitzurse, have been minding yours."</p> 
<p>"I minding mine own business!" echoed Waldemar; "I have been engaged in that of Prince John, our joint patron."</p> 
<p>"As if thou hadst any other reason for that, Waldemar," said De Bracy, "than the promotion of thine own individual interest? Come, Fitzurse, we know each other---ambition is thy pursuit, pleasure is mine, and they become our different ages. Of Prince John thou thinkest as I do; that he is too weak to be a determined monarch, too tyrannical to be an easy monarch, too insolent and presumptuous to be a popular monarch, and too fickle and timid to be long a monarch of any kind. But he is a monarch by whom Fitzurse and De Bracy hope to rise and thrive; and therefore you aid him with your policy, and I with the lances of my Free Companions."</p> 
<p>"A hopeful auxiliary," said Fitzurse impatiently; "playing the fool in the very moment of utter necessity.---What on earth dost thou purpose by this absurd disguise at a moment so urgent?"</p> 
<p>"To get me a wife," answered De Bracy coolly, "after the manner of the tribe of Benjamin."</p> 
<p>"The tribe of Benjamin?" said Fitzurse; "I comprehend thee not."</p> 
<p>"Wert thou not in presence yester-even," said De Bracy, "when we heard the Prior Aymer tell us a tale in reply to the romance which was sung by the Minstrel?---He told how, long since in Palestine, a deadly feud arose between the tribe of Benjamin and the rest of the Israelitish nation; and how they cut to pieces well-nigh all the chivalry of that tribe; and how they swore by our blessed Lady, that they would not permit those who remained to marry in their lineage; and how they became grieved for their vow, and sent to consult his holiness the Pope how they might be absolved from it; and how, by the advice of the Holy Father, the youth of the tribe of Benjamin carried off from a superb tournament all the ladies who were there present, and thus won them wives without the consent either of their brides or their brides' families."</p> 
<p>"I have heard the story," said Fitzurse, "though either the Prior or thou has made some singular alterations in date and circumstances."</p> 
<p>"I tell thee," said De Bracy, "that I mean to purvey me a wife after the fashion of the tribe of Benjamin; which is as much as to say, that in this same equipment I will fall upon that herd of Saxon bullocks, who have this night left the castle, and carry off from them the lovely Rowena."</p> 
<p>"Art thou mad, De Bracy?" said Fitzurse. "Bethink thee that, though the men be Saxons, they are rich and powerful, and regarded with the more respect by their countrymen, that wealth and honour are but the lot of few of Saxon descent."</p> 
<p>"And should belong to none," said De Bracy; "the work of the Conquest should be completed."</p> 
<p>"This is no time for it at least," said Fitzurse "the approaching crisis renders the favour of the multitude indispensable, and Prince John cannot refuse justice to any one who injures their favourites."</p> 
<p>"Let him grant it, if he dare," said De Bracy; "he will soon see the difference betwixt the support of such a lusty lot of spears as mine, and that of a heartless mob of Saxon churls. Yet I mean no immediate discovery of myself. Seem I not in this garb as bold a forester as ever blew horn? The blame of the violence shall rest with the outlaws of the Yorkshire forests. I have sure spies on the Saxon's motions---To-night they sleep in the convent of Saint Wittol, or Withold, or whatever they call that churl of a Saxon Saint at Burton-on-Trent. Next day's march brings them within our reach, and, falcon-ways, we swoop on them at once. Presently after I will appear in mine own shape, play the courteous knight, rescue the unfortunate and afflicted fair one from the hands of the rude ravishers, conduct her to Front-de-Boeuf's Castle, or to Normandy, if it should be necessary, and produce her not again to her kindred until she be the bride and dame of Maurice de Bracy."</p> 
<p>"A marvellously sage plan," said Fitzurse, "and, as I think, not entirely of thine own device.---Come, be frank, De Bracy, who aided thee in the invention? and who is to assist in the execution? for, as I think, thine own band lies as far off as York."</p> 
<p>"Marry, if thou must needs know," said De Bracy, "it was the Templar Brian de Bois-Guilbert that shaped out the enterprise, which the adventure of the men of Benjamin suggested to me. He is to aid me in the onslaught, and he and his followers will personate the outlaws, from whom my valorous arm is, after changing my garb, to rescue the lady."</p> 
<p>"By my halidome," said Fitzurse, "the plan was worthy of your united wisdom! and thy prudence, De Bracy, is most especially manifested in the project of leaving the lady in the hands of thy worthy confederate. Thou mayst, I think, succeed in taking her from her Saxon friends, but how thou wilt rescue her afterwards from the clutches of Bois-Guilbert seems considerably more doubtful---He is a falcon well accustomed to pounce on a partridge, and to hold his prey fast."</p> 
<p>"He is a Templar," said De Bracy, "and cannot therefore rival me in my plan of wedding this heiress;---and to attempt aught dishonourable against the intended bride of De Bracy---By Heaven! were he a whole Chapter of his Order in his single person, he dared not do me such an injury!"</p> 
<p>"Then since nought that I can say," said Fitzurse, "will put this folly from thy imagination, (for well I know the obstinacy of thy disposition,) at least waste as little time as possible---let not thy folly be lasting as well as untimely."</p> 
<p>"I tell thee," answered De Bracy, "that it will be the work of a few hours, and I shall be at York---at the head of my daring and valorous fellows, as ready to support any bold design as thy policy can be to form one.---But I hear my comrades assembling, and the steeds stamping and neighing in the outer court. ---Farewell.---I go, like a true knight, to win the smiles of beauty."</p> 
<p>"Like a true knight?" repeated Fitzurse, looking after him; "like a fool, I should say, or like a child, who will leave the most serious and needful occupation, to chase the down of the thistle that drives past him.---But it is with such tools that I must work;---and for whose advantage?---For that of a Prince as unwise as he is profligate, and as likely to be an ungrateful master as he has already proved a rebellious son and an unnatural brother. ---But he---he, too, is but one of the tools with which I labour; and, proud as he is, should he presume to separate his interest from mine, this is a secret which he shall soon learn."</p> 
<p>The meditations of the statesman were here interrupted by the voice of the Prince from an interior apartment, calling out, "Noble Waldemar Fitzurse!" and, with bonnet doffed, the future Chancellor (for to such high preferment did the wily Norman aspire) hastened to receive the orders of the future sovereign.</p>

<p>谁能说这是不应该的？</p> 
<p>《巴西尔，一出悲剧》</p> 
<p>就像蜘蛛费尽心机要修补它支离破碎的网一样，沃尔德马·菲泽西也干方百计要让约翰亲王人心涣散的小集团重整旗鼓，东山再起。在这个集团中真心参加的人本来不多，真正拥戴亲王的更是没有。这使菲泽酉必须许给他们各种新的利益，同时也让他们看到他们目前的权势来自哪里。对年轻放荡的贵族，他让他们明白，只有在亲王的统治下，他们才能胡作非为不受惩罚，过无法无天、荒淫无耻的生活；对野心勃勃的人，他许给他们权力，对贪婪的人，他答应他们增加财富，扩充领地。雇佣兵的头领从他这里拿到了金银珠宝——这对他们是最有说服力的理由，没有它，其他一切只是废话。除了金钱，这位长袖善舞的说客还许下了各种更广泛的诺言。总之，凡是可以制止动摇，振奋人心的一切手段都用尽了。关于理查国王回国的事，在他嘴里成了根本不可能的海外奇谈；然而那些怀疑的目光和模棱两可的回答却告诉他，这仍是索绕在那些党羽心头的一大隐忧，于是他大胆加以驳斥，认为即使这成为事实，也不能改变他们对政治形势的整个估计。</p> 
<p>“如果理查回来了，”菲泽西说，“那些没有跟他前往圣地的人就会倒霉，不得不把财产让给穷苦潦倒、囊空如洗的十字军战士；那些在他外出期间违反法律，侵犯了王室领地和特权的，便会遭到清算。他会为圣殿骑士团和医护骑士团在圣地作战期间，偏袒法王腓力二世的行为进行报复。总之，他回来后，会把一切依附他的兄弟约翰亲王的人，都当作叛逆给予惩罚。你们怕他的强大力量吗？”亲王的这位能说会道的亲信继续道，“我们承认他是一个坚强而英勇的骑士，但现在已不是亚瑟王的时代，不是一个勇士可以对抗一支军队的时代了。如果理查真的回到国内，他必然只成了孤家寡人，没有部下，也没有朋友。他那支英勇的军队已变成白骨，堆积在巴勒斯坦的沙漠中了。他的部下回来的寥寥无几，只是像艾文荷的威尔弗莱德那样一些身无分文、心力交瘁的人。再说，所谓理查的继承权算得什么呢？”他又对在这个问题上怀有疑虑的人继续道，“按照长子继承法，理查的权利难道还能超过征服者的长子，诺曼底公爵罗伯特吗？(注)然而红脸威廉和亨利，征服者的第二个和第三个儿子，却相继得到了全国一致的拥戴。罗伯特具备理查所有的一切优点：他是一个勇敢的骑士，一个优秀的领导人，对朋友和教会慷慨大方，除了这一切，他还是一个十字军战士，圣墓的收复者，然而他却成了双目失明的悲惨囚徒，死在加的夫城堡中了，因为他违背人民的意志，人民不愿接受他的统治。我们有权利从王室血统的后裔中，选择最有条件掌握国家权力的人，那就是说，”他又赶紧纠正道，“选择最能促进贵族的利益的人。从个人的品质而言，”他又道，“约翰亲王可能不如他的兄长理查；但是如果考虑到后者是拿着复仇的剑回来的，而前者带给我们的却是恩赏、宽恕（特权、财富和荣誉，那么毫无疑问，聪明的贵族应该拥戴这个人作国王。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)征服者即指征服者威廉一世，他征眼英国后，把诺曼底赐给长子罗伯特作封地，又把英国赐给次子红脸威廉（登基后称威廉二世）。威廉一世去世后，罗伯特便发动叛乱，争夺英国王位。威廉二世利用减税等手段笼络人心，得到了诸侯的拥戴，罗伯特因而失败，退回诺曼底。红脸威廉于1100年去世，由兄弟亨利继位，称亨利一世；1106年罗伯特再度发动叛乱，争夺王位，战败后被亨利一世囚禁在加的夫城堡，历时二十多年，于1134年死在狱中。</p> 
<p>这些和其他许多理由，有些是针对他所游说的人的特殊情况提出的，但它们都对约翰亲王的小集团中的贵族产生了预期的效果。他们中的大部分人允诺出席预定在约克城举行的会议，它的目的便是要为拥立约翰亲王作出全面的安排。</p> 
<p>到了深夜，在多方奔走之后，菲泽西精疲力竭地回到阿什贝城堡时，虽然踌躇满志，却发现德布拉西已脱下参加宴会的服饰，换了一身打扮：上身穿着草绿色短外衣，下身穿着同样质地和颜色的裤子，头上戴着皮帽或头盔，身边佩着一柄短剑，肩上用皮带挂着一只号角，手里拿着一把长弓，腰带上插着一束箭。要是菲泽西在外屋遇见他，会把他当作卫队中的一名弓箭手，毫不理会地走过去，但是在里屋看到他，他不得不引起注意，这才认出那只是一个穿着英国卫士服装的诺曼骑士。</p> 
<p>“德布拉西，你这身打扮是怎么回事？”菲泽西说，有些生气，“难道在我们的主人约翰亲王的命运正处在危急关头的时候，你还有兴趣玩圣诞游戏，或者举办假面舞会不成？你为什么不像我一样，到那些没心肝的胆小鬼中间去？据说，萨拉森人的孩子听到理查王的名字都害怕，现在这些胆小鬼也是这样呢！”</p> 
<p>“我得忙我自己的事，”德布拉西满不在乎地回答，“正如你也在忙你自己的事一样，菲泽酉。”</p> 
<p>“我这是忙我自己的事？”沃尔德马反问道，“我是在为我们共同的主人约翰亲王办事?”</p> 
<p>“你那么做除了为你自己升官发财，难道还有别的原因不成？”德布拉西说。“得啦，沃尔德马，我们谁也骗不了谁，你是野心勃勃，我却只想寻欢作乐，这是我们不同的年龄决定的。关于约翰亲王，你的想法同我的一样，那就是说，他太懦弱，不可能成为一个雄才大略的国王，太残暴，不可能是一个平易近人的国王，太傲慢和专横，不可能变成一个深得人心的国王，又太反复无常，太胆小怕事，不论他是怎样一个国王，都不可能长期不变。然而他是菲泽西和德布拉西所支持和拥戴的国王，因此你用你的政治手腕，我用我的自由兵团帮助他。”</p> 
<p>“好一个得力的助手！”菲泽西不耐烦地说，“到了危急存亡的关键时刻还在那么胡闹。请问，你在这个紧急关头穿上这套奇装异服，是为了什么？”</p> 
<p>“为了得到一个妻子，”德布拉西泰然自若地答道，“按照便雅悯人的办法，实行抢亲(注)。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)便雅悯人本来是以色列十二支派中的一支，后来因得罪了其他支派，互相残杀，其他支派相约不准本族的女子嫁给便雅悯人，便雅悯人只得实行抢亲，把她们占为己有，见《旧约·士师记》第20至21章。</p> 
<p>“抢亲！”菲泽西说，“我不明白你的意思。”</p> 
<p>“昨天晚上你不也在场吗？”德布拉西说。“我们听行吟诗人唱浪漫曲子后，艾默长老不是给我们讲了一个故事？他说，很早以前在巴勒斯坦，使雅悯部族与以色列民族的其他部族成了水火不相容的仇敌，他们怎样把那个部族的勇士几乎斩尽杀绝，又怎样向圣母起誓，不让剩下的那些人娶他们的女儿为妻；后来他们怎么为自己起的誓后悔了，便找会中的长老商量怎样解除那个誓言；于是便雅悯的年轻人便按照长老的劝告，在一次盛大的比武大会上把那里所有的女子抢走，不经过新娘本人和家族的同意，便把她们占为己有，作了妻子。”</p> 
<p>“我听说过这个故事，”菲泽西说，“只是时间和情节都有些不同，不知这是长老还是你别出心裁改的。”</p> 
<p>“不瞒你说，”德布拉酉答道，“我现在便是要按照便雅们人的办法，给自己找一个妻子，那就是说，我要穿着这身衣服，趁那些撒克逊公牛今天晚上挈带家眷离开城堡的时候，在半路上袭击他们，把可爱的罗文娜枪到手中。”</p> 
<p>“你疯了不成，德布拉酉？”菲泽酉说。“你得想想，他们虽然是撒克逊人，但都有财有势，而且深得他们国人的尊敬，因为现在撒克逊血统的人有钱有地位的已屈指可数了。”</p> 
<p>“他们本来不该拥有这一切，”德布拉西说，“征服者的事业必须完成。”</p> 
<p>“至少目前还不是时候，”菲泽西说，“眼前出现的危机使民众的支持变得不可缺少，任何人伤害了他们所尊重的人，他们告到约翰亲王那里，亲王也不能不秉公处理。”</p> 
<p>“他敢处理就让他处理，”德布拉西说，“他马上就会看到，究竟是靠我手下这批强壮的小伙子好，还是靠撒克逊人那些没有心肝的乌合之众好。何况我并不想马上暴露我的身分。瞧，我这身打扮不像一个惯吹号角的山林大盗吗？抢亲的罪责会落在约克郡森林中那些亡命之徒身上。我已派出探子，监视撒克逊人的行动。今晚他们得在特伦特河畔伯顿的一所修道院过夜，它名叫圣维特尔修道院或圣维索尔修道院，管它呢，随他们把这个圣徒叫什么名字。明天他们就会进入我们的势力范围，我们可以像老鹰抓小鸡那样把他们抓走。这以后我就恢复我的本来面目，像一个彬彬有礼的骑士，从那些粗鲁的土匪手里救出落难的不幸美女，把她送往牛面将军的城堡，必要的话，也可以把她带往诺曼底，在她成为莫里斯·德布拉西的新娘和夫人以前，再也见不到她的亲属。”</p> 
<p>“这计划称得上神机妙算，”菲泽酉说，“不过据我看，这不完全是你自己策划的。好吧，德布拉西，老实告诉我，这是谁帮你出的主意，实行时又是谁给你当帮手？因为据我所知，你的队伍还远在约克城呢。”</p> 
<p>“行，你要知道，告诉你也可以，”德布拉酉说，“这是我与圣殿骑士布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔一起，从便雅悯人的冒险活动中得到了启示，一起商定的计策。他帮助我进行这次袭击，他和他的部下扮作强盗，然后我改变装束后，凭这条强有力的胳臂从他们手中救出小姐。”</p> 
<p>“我的老天爷，”菲泽酉说，“这计划称得上你们两人的智慧结晶！你很谨慎，这尤其表现在你打算把那位小姐先留在得力的助手那里，德布拉西。不过我想，你可以轻而易举地把她从她的撒克逊亲人那里抢走，可是接着，怎么从布瓦吉贝尔手掌中救出她，恐怕就不那么容易了。他是一只苍鹰，一向只习惯抓走鹧鸪，不会把到手的东西放走的。”</p> 
<p>“他是一名圣殿骑士，”德布拉西说，“因此不可能与我作对，破坏我娶这位女继承人的计划，也不至于干出任何不光彩的事，想抢走德布拉西看中的新娘。凭上帝起誓，哪怕他有整个骑士团作他的后盾，他也不敢干这种伤害我的事！”</p> 
<p>“我知道，不论我讲什么，”菲泽西说，“你也不会醒悟，抛弃你的幻想，因为你天生就这么固执；那么你尽量少花些时间，别把这件不合时宜的蠢事拖得太久吧。”</p> 
<p>“你放心，”德布拉西答道，“这事只需要几个钟头，办好后，我马上带领我那些大胆勇敢的部下奔赴约克城，不论你定下的方针多么危险，我也一定支持你。现在我听得我的伙计们在集合了，马已在外面院子里踢蹄子和嘶叫。再见。我走了，像一个真正的骑士，要去赢得美人的微笑了。”</p> 
<p>“像一个真正的骑士！”菲泽西望着他的背影念叨道，“不如说像一个傻瓜，像一个孩子，丢下最重要的大事不干，去追逐飘过他身边的一簇飞絮。可是我能利用的只是这些工具，而且这是为了谁的利益？为了一个既愚蠢无知，又放荡任性的亲王，还可能是一个忘恩负义的主子，就像他已证明是一个叛逆的儿子和邪恶的弟兄一样。但是他——他也只是我手中的一件工具罢了；尽管他自命不凡，也不敢把他的利益与我的分开，这是一个他不久就会明白的秘密。”</p> 
<p>那位大臣想到这里，便给亲王的声音打断了；后者在里屋喊道：“高贵的沃尔德马·菲泽西！”于是未来的首相——因为那个狡猾的诺曼人指望的正是这个显赫的职位——便摘下帽子，赶快进去接受未来的国王的指示了。</p>
