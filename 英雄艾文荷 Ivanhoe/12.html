<p>The Disinherited Knight had no sooner reached his pavilion, than squires and pages in abundance tendered their services to disarm him, to bring fresh attire, and to offer him the refreshment of the bath. Their zeal on this occasion was perhaps sharpened by curiosity, since every one desired to know who the knight was that had gained so many laurels, yet had refused, even at the command of Prince John, to lift his visor or to name his name. But their officious inquisitiveness was not gratified. The Disinherited Knight refused all other assistance save that of his own squire, or rather yeoman---a clownish-looking man, who, wrapt in a cloak of dark-coloured felt, and having his head and face half-buried in a Norman bonnet made of black fur, seemed to affect the incognito as much as his master. All others being excluded from the tent, this attendant relieved his master from the more burdensome parts of his armour, and placed food and wine before him, which the exertions of the day rendered very acceptable.</p> 
<p>The Knight had scarcely finished a hasty meal, ere his menial announced to him that five men, each leading a barbed steed, desired to speak with him. The Disinherited Knight had exchanged his armour for the long robe usually worn by those of his condition, which, being furnished with a hood, concealed the features, when such was the pleasure of the wearer, almost as completely as the visor of the helmet itself, but the twilight, which was now fast darkening, would of itself have rendered a disguise unnecessary, unless to persons to whom the face of an individual chanced to be particularly well known.</p> 
<p>The Disinherited Knight, therefore, stept boldly forth to the front of his tent, and found in attendance the squires of the challengers, whom he easily knew by their russet and black dresses, each of whom led his master's charger, loaded with the armour in which he had that day fought.</p> 
<p>"According to the laws of chivalry," said the foremost of these men, "I, Baldwin de Oyley, squire to the redoubted Knight Brian de Bois-Guilbert, make offer to you, styling yourself, for the present, the Disinherited Knight, of the horse and armour used by the said Brian de Bois-Guilbert in this day's Passage of Arms, leaving it with your nobleness to retain or to ransom the same, according to your pleasure; for such is the law of arms."</p> 
<p>The other squires repeated nearly the same formula, and then stood to await the decision of the Disinherited Knight.</p> 
<p>"To you four, sirs," replied the Knight, addressing those who had last spoken, "and to your honourable and valiant masters, I have one common reply. Commend me to the noble knights, your masters, and say, I should do ill to deprive them of steeds and arms which can never be used by braver cavaliers.---I would I could here end my message to these gallant knights; but being, as I term myself, in truth and earnest, the Disinherited, I must be thus far bound to your masters, that they will, of their courtesy, be pleased to ransom their steeds and armour, since that which I wear I can hardly term mine own."</p> 
<p>"We stand commissioned, each of us," answered the squire of Reginald Front-de-Boeuf, "to offer a hundred zecchins in ransom of these horses and suits of armour."</p> 
<p>"It is sufficient," said the Disinherited Knight. "Half the sum my present necessities compel me to accept; of the remaining half, distribute one moiety among yourselves, sir squires, and divide the other half betwixt the heralds and the pursuivants, and minstrels, and attendants."</p> 
<p>The squires, with cap in hand, and low reverences, expressed their deep sense of a courtesy and generosity not often practised, at least upon a scale so extensive. The Disinherited Knight then addressed his discourse to Baldwin, the squire of Brian de Bois-Guilbert. "From your master," said he, "I will accept neither arms nor ransom. Say to him in my name, that our strife is not ended---no, not till we have fought as well with swords as with lances---as well on foot as on horseback. To this mortal quarrel he has himself defied me, and I shall not forget the challenge.---Meantime, let him be assured, that I hold him not as one of his companions, with whom I can with pleasure exchange courtesies; but rather as one with whom I stand upon terms of mortal defiance."</p> 
<p>"My master," answered Baldwin, "knows how to requite scorn with scorn, and blows with blows, as well as courtesy with courtesy. Since you disdain to accept from him any share of the ransom at which you have rated the arms of the other knights, I must leave his armour and his horse here, being well assured that he will never deign to mount the one nor wear the other."</p> 
<p>"You have spoken well, good squire," said the Disinherited Knight, "well and boldly, as it beseemeth him to speak who answers for an absent master. Leave not, however, the horse and armour here. Restore them to thy master; or, if he scorns to accept them, retain them, good friend, for thine own use. So far as they are mine, I bestow them upon you freely."</p> 
<p>Baldwin made a deep obeisance, and retired with his companions; and the Disinherited Knight entered the pavilion.</p> 
<p>"Thus far, Gurth," said he, addressing his attendant, "the reputation of English chivalry hath not suffered in my hands."</p> 
<p>"And I," said Gurth, "for a Saxon swineherd, have not ill played the personage of a Norman squire-at-arms."</p> 
<p>"Yea, but," answered the Disinherited Knight, "thou hast ever kept me in anxiety lest thy clownish bearing should discover thee."</p> 
<p>"Tush!" said Gurth, "I fear discovery from none, saving my playfellow, Wamba the Jester, of whom I could never discover whether he were most knave or fool. Yet I could scarce choose but laugh, when my old master passed so near to me, dreaming all the while that Gurth was keeping his porkers many a mile off, in the thickets and swamps of Rotherwood. If I am discovered------"</p> 
<p>"Enough," said the Disinherited Knight, "thou knowest my promise."</p> 
<p>"Nay, for that matter," said Gurth, "I will never fail my friend for fear of my skin-cutting. I have a tough hide, that will bear knife or scourge as well as any boar's hide in my herd."</p> 
<p>"Trust me, I will requite the risk you run for my love, Gurth," said the Knight. "Meanwhile, I pray you to accept these ten pieces of gold."</p> 
<p>"I am richer," said Gurth, putting them into his pouch, "than ever was swineherd or bondsman."</p> 
<p>"Take this bag of gold to Ashby," continued his master, "and find out Isaac the Jew of York, and let him pay himself for the horse and arms with which his credit supplied me."</p> 
<p>"Nay, by St Dunstan," replied Gurth, "that I will not do."</p> 
<p>"How, knave," replied his master, "wilt thou not obey my commands?"</p> 
<p>"So they be honest, reasonable, and Christian commands," replied Gurth; "but this is none of these. To suffer the Jew to pay himself would be dishonest, for it would be cheating my master; and unreasonable, for it were the part of a fool; and unchristian, since it would be plundering a believer to enrich an infidel."</p> 
<p>"See him contented, however, thou stubborn varlet," said the Disinherited Knight.</p> 
<p>"I will do so," said Gurth, taking the bag under his cloak, and leaving the apartment; "and it will go hard," he muttered, "but I content him with one-half of his own asking." So saying, he departed, and left the Disinherited Knight to his own perplexed ruminations; which, upon more accounts than it is now possible to communicate to the reader, were of a nature peculiarly agitating and painful.</p> 
<p>We must now change the scene to the village of Ashby, or rather to a country house in its vicinity belonging to a wealthy Israelite, with whom Isaac, his daughter, and retinue, had taken up their quarters; the Jews, it is well known, being as liberal in exercising the duties of hospitality and charity among their own people, as they were alleged to be reluctant and churlish in extending them to those whom they termed Gentiles, and whose treatment of them certainly merited little hospitality at their hand.</p> 
<p>In an apartment, small indeed, but richly furnished with decorations of an Oriental taste, Rebecca was seated on a heap of embroidered cushions, which, piled along a low platform that surrounded the chamber, served, like the estrada of the Spaniards, instead of chairs and stools. She was watching the motions of her father with a look of anxious and filial affection, while he paced the apartment with a dejected mien and disordered step; sometimes clasping his hands together ---sometimes casting his eyes to the roof of the apartment, as one who laboured under great mental tribulation. "O, Jacob!" he exclaimed---"O, all ye twelve Holy Fathers of our tribe! what a losing venture is this for one who hath duly kept every jot and tittle of the law of Moses---Fifty zecchins wrenched from me at one clutch, and by the talons of a tyrant!"</p> 
<p>"But, father," said Rebecca, "you seemed to give the gold to Prince John willingly."</p> 
<p>"Willingly? the blotch of Egypt upon him!---Willingly, saidst thou?---Ay, as willingly as when, in the Gulf of Lyons, I flung over my merchandise to lighten the ship, while she laboured in the tempest---robed the seething billows in my choice silks ---perfumed their briny foam with myrrh and aloes---enriched their caverns with gold and silver work! And was not that an hour of unutterable misery, though my own hands made the sacrifice?"</p> 
<p>"But it was a sacrifice which Heaven exacted to save our lives," answered Rebecca, "and the God of our fathers has since blessed your store and your gettings."</p> 
<p>"Ay," answered Isaac, "but if the tyrant lays hold on them as he did to-day, and compels me to smile while he is robbing me?---O, daughter, disinherited and wandering as we are, the worst evil which befalls our race is, that when we are wronged and plundered, all the world laughs around, and we are compelled to suppress our sense of injury, and to smile tamely, when we would revenge bravely."</p> 
<p>"Think not thus of it, my father," said Rebecca; "we also have advantages. These Gentiles, cruel and oppressive as they are, are in some sort dependent on the dispersed children of Zion, whom they despise and persecute. Without the aid of our wealth, they could neither furnish forth their hosts in war, nor their triumphs in peace, and the gold which we lend them returns with increase to our coffers. We are like the herb which flourisheth most when it is most trampled on. Even this day's pageant had not proceeded without the consent of the despised Jew, who furnished the means."</p> 
<p>"Daughter," said Isaac, "thou hast harped upon another string of sorrow. The goodly steed and the rich armour, equal to the full profit of my adventure with our Kirjath Jairam of Leicester ---there is a dead loss too---ay, a loss which swallows up the gains of a week; ay, of the space between two Sabbaths---and yet it may end better than I now think, for 'tis a good youth."</p> 
<p>"Assuredly," said Rebecca, "you shall not repent you of requiting the good deed received of the stranger knight."</p> 
<p>"I trust so, daughter," said Isaac, "and I trust too in the rebuilding of Zion; but as well do I hope with my own bodily eyes to see the walls and battlements of the new Temple, as to see a Christian, yea, the very best of Christians, repay a debt to a Jew, unless under the awe of the judge and jailor."</p> 
<p>So saying, he resumed his discontented walk through the apartment; and Rebecca, perceiving that her attempts at consolation only served to awaken new subjects of complaint, wisely desisted from her unavailing efforts---a prudential line of conduct, and we recommend to all who set up for comforters and advisers, to follow it in the like circumstances.</p> 
<p>The evening was now becoming dark, when a Jewish servant entered the apartment, and placed upon the table two silver lamps, fed with perfumed oil; the richest wines, and the most delicate refreshments, were at the same time displayed by another Israelitish domestic on a small ebony table, inlaid with silver; for, in the interior of their houses, the Jews refused themselves no expensive indulgences. At the same time the servant informed Isaac, that a Nazarene (so they termed Christians, while conversing among themselves) desired to speak with him. He that would live by traffic, must hold himself at the disposal of every one claiming business with him. Isaac at once replaced on the table the untasted glass of Greek wine which he had just raised to his lips, and saying hastily to his daughter, "Rebecca, veil thyself," commanded the stranger to be admitted.</p> 
<p>Just as Rebecca had dropped over her fine features a screen of silver gauze which reached to her feet, the door opened, and Gurth entered, wrapt in the ample folds of his Norman mantle. His appearance was rather suspicious than prepossessing, especially as, instead of doffing his bonnet, he pulled it still deeper over his rugged brow.</p> 
<p>"Art thou Isaac the Jew of York?" said Gurth, in Saxon.</p> 
<p>"I am," replied Isaac, in the same language, (for his traffic had rendered every tongue spoken in Britain familiar to him)---"and who art thou?"</p> 
<p>"That is not to the purpose," answered Gurth.</p> 
<p>"As much as my name is to thee," replied Isaac; "for without knowing thine, how can I hold intercourse with thee?"</p> 
<p>"Easily," answered Gurth; "I, being to pay money, must know that I deliver it to the right person; thou, who are to receive it, will not, I think, care very greatly by whose hands it is delivered."</p> 
<p>"O," said the Jew, "you are come to pay moneys?---Holy Father Abraham! that altereth our relation to each other. And from whom dost thou bring it?"</p> 
<p>"From the Disinherited Knight," said Gurth, "victor in this day's tournament. It is the price of the armour supplied to him by Kirjath Jairam of Leicester, on thy recommendation. The steed is restored to thy stable. I desire to know the amount of the sum which I am to pay for the armour."</p> 
<p>"I said he was a good youth!" exclaimed Isaac with joyful exultation. "A cup of wine will do thee no harm," he added, filling and handing to the swineherd a richer drought than Gurth had ever before tasted. "And how much money," continued Isaac, "has thou brought with thee?"</p> 
<p>"Holy Virgin!" said Gurth, setting down the cup, "what nectar these unbelieving dogs drink, while true Christians are fain to quaff ale as muddy and thick as the draff we give to hogs!---What money have I brought with me?" continued the Saxon, when he had finished this uncivil ejaculation, "even but a small sum; something in hand the whilst. What, Isaac! thou must bear a conscience, though it be a Jewish one."</p> 
<p>"Nay, but," said Isaac, "thy master has won goodly steeds and rich armours with the strength of his lance, and of his right hand---but 'tis a good youth---the Jew will take these in present payment, and render him back the surplus."</p> 
<p>"My master has disposed of them already," said Gurth.</p> 
<p>"Ah! that was wrong," said the Jew, "that was the part of a fool. No Christians here could buy so many horses and armour---no Jew except myself would give him half the values. But thou hast a hundred zecchins with thee in that bag," said Isaac, prying under Gurth's cloak, "it is a heavy one."</p> 
<p>"I have heads for cross-bow bolts in it," said Gurth, readily.</p> 
<p>"Well, then"---said Isaac, panting and hesitating between habitual love of gain and a new-born desire to be liberal in the present instance, "if I should say that I would take eighty zecchins for the good steed and the rich armour, which leaves me not a guilder's profit, have you money to pay me?"</p> 
<p>"Barely," said Gurth, though the sum demanded was more reasonable than he expected, "and it will leave my master nigh penniless. Nevertheless, if such be your least offer, I must be content."</p> 
<p>"Fill thyself another goblet of wine," said the Jew. "Ah! eighty zecchins is too little. It leaveth no profit for the usages of the moneys; and, besides, the good horse may have suffered wrong in this day's encounter. O, it was a hard and a dangerous meeting! man and steed rushing on each other like wild bulls of Bashan! The horse cannot but have had wrong."</p> 
<p>"And I say," replied Gurth, "he is sound, wind and limb; and you may see him now, in your stable. And I say, over and above, that seventy zecchins is enough for the armour, and I hope a Christian's word is as good as a Jew's. If you will not take seventy, I will carry this bag" (and he shook it till the contents jingled) "back to my master."</p> 
<p>"Nay, nay!" said Isaac; "lay down the talents---the shekels---the eighty zecchins, and thou shalt see I will consider thee liberally."</p> 
<p>Gurth at length complied; and telling out eighty zecchins upon the table, the Jew delivered out to him an acquittance for the horse and suit of armour. The Jew's hand trembled for joy as he wrapped up the first seventy pieces of gold. The last ten he told over with much deliberation, pausing, and saying something as he took each piece from the table, and dropt it into his purse. It seemed as if his avarice were struggling with his better nature, and compelling him to pouch zecchin after zecchin while his generosity urged him to restore some part at least to his benefactor, or as a donation to his agent. His whole speech ran nearly thus:</p> 
<p>"Seventy-one---seventy-two; thy master is a good youth ---seventy-three, an excellent youth---seventy-four---that piece hath been clipt within the ring---seventy-five---and that looketh light of weight ---seventy-six---when thy master wants money, let him come to Isaac of York---seventy-seven---that is, with reasonable security." Here he made a considerable pause, and Gurth had good hope that the last three pieces might escape the fate of their comrades; but the enumeration proceeded. ---"Seventy-eight---thou art a good fellow---seventy-nine---and deservest something for thyself------"</p> 
<p>Here the Jew paused again, and looked at the last zecchin, intending, doubtless, to bestow it upon Gurth. He weighed it upon the tip of his finger, and made it ring by dropping it upon the table. Had it rung too flat, or had it felt a hair's breadth too light, generosity had carried the day; but, unhappily for Gurth, the chime was full and true, the zecchin plump, newly coined, and a grain above weight. Isaac could not find in his heart to part with it, so dropt it into his purse as if in absence of mind, with the words, "Eighty completes the tale, and I trust thy master will reward thee handsomely.---Surely," he added, looking earnestly at the bag, "thou hast more coins in that pouch?"</p> 
<p>Gurth grinned, which was his nearest approach to a laugh, as he replied, "About the same quantity which thou hast just told over so carefully." He then folded the quittance, and put it under his cap, adding,---"Peril of thy beard, Jew, see that this be full and ample!" He filled himself unbidden, a third goblet of wine, and left the apartment without ceremony.</p> 
<p>"Rebecca," said the Jew, "that Ishmaelite hath gone somewhat beyond me. Nevertheless his master is a good youth---ay, and I am well pleased that he hath gained shekels of gold and shekels of silver, even by the speed of his horse and by the strength of his lance, which, like that of Goliath the Philistine, might vie with a weaver's beam."</p> 
<p>As he turned to receive Rebecca's answer, he observed, that during his chattering with Gurth, she had left the apartment unperceived.</p> 
<p>In the meanwhile, Gurth had descended the stair, and, having reached the dark antechamber or hall, was puzzling about to discover the entrance, when a figure in white, shown by a small silver lamp which she held in her hand, beckoned him into a side apartment. Gurth had some reluctance to obey the summons. Rough and impetuous as a wild boar, where only earthly force was to be apprehended, he had all the characteristic terrors of a Saxon respecting fawns, forest-fiends, white women, and the whole of the superstitions which his ancestors had brought with them from the wilds of Germany. He remembered, moreover, that he was in the house of a Jew, a people who, besides the other unamiable qualities which popular report ascribed to them, were supposed to be profound necromancers and cabalists. Nevertheless, after a moment's pause, he obeyed the beckoning summons of the apparition, and followed her into the apartment which she indicated, where he found to his joyful surprise that his fair guide was the beautiful Jewess whom he had seen at the tournament, and a short time in her father's apartment.</p> 
<p>She asked him the particulars of his transaction with Isaac, which he detailed accurately.</p> 
<p>"My father did but jest with thee, good fellow," said Rebecca; "he owes thy master deeper kindness than these arms and steed could pay, were their value tenfold. What sum didst thou pay my father even now?"</p> 
<p>"Eighty zecchins," said Gurth, surprised at the question.</p> 
<p>"In this purse," said Rebecca, "thou wilt find a hundred. Restore to thy master that which is his due, and enrich thyself with the remainder. Haste---begone---stay not to render thanks! and beware how you pass through this crowded town, where thou mayst easily lose both thy burden and thy life.---Reuben," she added, clapping her hands together, "light forth this stranger, and fail not to draw lock and bar behind him." Reuben, a dark-brow'd and black-bearded Israelite, obeyed her summons, with a torch in his hand; undid the outward door of the house, and conducting Gurth across a paved court, let him out through a wicket in the entrance-gate, which he closed behind him with such bolts and chains as would well have become that of a prison.</p> 
<p>"By St Dunstan," said Gurth, as he stumbled up the dark avenue, "this is no Jewess, but an angel from heaven! Ten zecchins from my brave young master---twenty from this pearl of Zion---Oh, happy day!---Such another, Gurth, will redeem thy bondage, and make thee a brother as free of thy guild as the best. And then do I lay down my swineherd's horn and staff, and take the freeman's sword and buckler, and follow my young master to the death, without hiding either my face or my name."</p>

<p>剥夺继承权的骑士刚来到他的帐篷内，扈从和小厮们便一拥而上，要帮他解盔卸甲，改换服装，或者伺候梳洗。他们这么热情也可能是出于好奇心调为每人都想知道，这个骑士是何许人，他不仅屡战屡胜，而巨违抗约翰亲王的命令，拒绝揭开脸甲，公开他的姓名。但是他们的殷勤询问一无所获。剥夺继承权的骑士谢绝了一切人的帮助，只留下他自己的扈从——其实只是一个农夫，一个土头上脑的乡巴佬，穿一件深褐色毡大褂，戴一顶诺曼人的黑皮帽，把脸遮没了一半，仿佛也像他的主人一样，存心不让人认出他的真面目。等所有的人都离开帐篷后，这个仆役给主人卸下了盔甲上的笨重部分，然后端来了食物和酒，让他在一天的辛劳之后饱餐一顿。</p> 
<p>骑士狼吞虎咽地刚才吃完，他的仆人已来报告，有五个人，每人都牵了一匹披鞍铝的战马，要面见他禀报一切。剥夺继承权的骑士已脱下盔甲，换了一件长袍，那是这类人常穿的，它附有兜帽，可以在需要的时候遮住脸部，作用几乎跟面甲完全一样；何况现在夜色已越来越浓，除非要与一个特别熟悉的人会面，一般说来，伪装已没有必要。</p> 
<p>因此剥夺继承权的骑士大胆走出了帐篷，发现等待他的便是挑战者们的扈从，这凭他们的褐色和黑色衣服便可看出，他们每人牵着主人的战马，战马上载着他那天比武时穿的盔甲。</p> 
<p>“我是著名的骑士布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔的扈从鲍德温·奥伊勒，”站在最前面的一个人说，“现在特地前来，按照骑士的规矩，向您——用您自己的说法，也就是剥夺继承权的骑士，呈交上述布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔在今天比武中所使用的战马和盔甲；您是留下它们，还是收取同等价值的赎金，由您自行决定，因为比武的规则就是这样的。”</p> 
<p>其余几个扈从几乎重复了同一套话，然后站在那里，等待剥夺继承权的骑士作出决定。</p> 
<p>“对于你们四人，先生们，”骑士向后面四人答道，“还有你们正直而勇敢的主人们，我可以一起回答。请代我向你们的主人，尊贵的骑士们致意，并转达我的话：我不想做不该做的事，夺取他们的战马和盔甲，使这些勇敢的骑士失去它们。我对他们的答复本可到此为止，但是正如我忠实而真诚地称呼自己的，我是个剥夺了继承权的人，我不得不要求你们的主人谅解，请他们为他们的战马和盔甲支付一定的赎金，因为我现在所使用的这些东西，可以说不是属于我自己的。”</p> 
<p>“我们的主人已交代过，”牛面将军雷金纳德的扈从答道，“我们每人可以拿出一百枚金币，作这些战马和盔甲的赎金。”</p> 
<p>“这就够了，”剥夺继承权的骑士说，“我目前的需要使我必须收下其中的一半；至于其余一半，不妨再分作两份，一份分给你们作酬劳，扈从先生们，另一份则分给典礼官和他们的助手，以及那些行吟诗人和仆人。”</p> 
<p>扈从们摘下帽子，深深鞠躬，表示了对这种不常遇到的、至少不会这么慷慨的赏赐和馈赠的敬意。剥夺继承权的骑士接着向布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔的扈从鲍德温继续他的谈话。“我不能接受你的主人的作战装备，也不能收取他的赎金，”他说， “请你用我的名义转告他，我们的战斗还没有结束——是的，我们还没有像比枪那样比过剑，像骑马比武那样徒步比过武。这种生死搏斗是他自己向我提出的，我不应忘记他的挑战。同时，请告诉他，我不能像对待他的朋友那样，对他也以礼相待，我只能把他当作一个誓不两立的敌人。”</p> 
<p>“我的主人知道怎样用礼貌回答礼貌，”鲍德温答道，“但也知道怎么用蔑视回答蔑视，用打击回答打击。既然您不屑按照其他骑士支付赎金的标准，接受他的赎金，那么我只得把他的战马和盔甲留在这儿，因为我相信，他决不愿再骑上这战马，再穿上这盔甲了二”</p> 
<p>“你讲得很好，英勇的扈从，”剥夺继承权的骑士说，“讲得很好，也很勇敢，像一个人的主人不在时应该为他讲的那样。然而你不能把战马和盔甲留在这儿。把它们交还你的主人，如果他不屑收回它们，那就你自己留着使用吧，我的朋友。既然它们算是我的，我就有权把它们转送给你。”</p> 
<p>鲍德温深深鞠了一躬，便随同他的伙伴们一起走了。剥夺继承权的骑士回进了帐篷。</p> 
<p>“就这样，葛四，”他对他的扈从说道，“到现在为止，我还没有损害过英国骑士的荣誉。”</p> 
<p>“我作为撒克逊放猪人，”葛四说，“扮演诺曼扈从的角色也扮得不赖呀。”</p> 
<p>“对，”剥夺继承权的骑士答道，“但是你这副乡巴佬的模样，一直叫我提心吊胆，怕给人看出破绽呢。”</p> 
<p>“嘘！”葛四说，“我不怕别人，只怕我那位小兄弟小丑汪八发现这秘密；我还摸不透，他究竟是无赖还是傻瓜。不过有一次我的老主人离我那么近，还是没有发现我，我开心得差点大笑，他还以为葛四仍在几英里以外，在罗瑟伍德的森林和沼泽里替他放猪呢。如果我给发现……”</p> 
<p>“够了，”剥夺继承权的骑士说，“我答应你的话是算数的。”</p> 
<p>“不，关于那点，”葛四说，“我决不会为了怕皮肉受苦，对不起我的朋友。我有一层坚韧的皮肤，它像我饲养的任何一头公猪的皮那么厚，不怕刀和鞭子。”</p> 
<p>“相信我，你为爱护我冒了危险，我会报答你的，葛四，”骑士说。“现在请你收下这十枚金币。”</p> 
<p>“那么我比任何一个放猪的，任何一个奴隶都富裕了，”葛四说，把金币放进了口袋。</p> 
<p>“把这袋金币送往阿什贝，”主人继续道，“找到约克的犹太人以撒，把钱给他，让他结清战马和盔甲的帐，这是我靠他担保借到的。”</p> 
<p>“不，凭圣邓斯坦起誓，”葛回答道，“这件事我不能干。”</p> 
<p>“怎么，你这小子，”主人说道，“你不愿服从我的命令？”</p> 
<p>“只要命令是对的，合理的，符合基督精神，我一定服从，”葛回答道，“但这个命令不是这样。把钱拿给犹太人去结帐，这便不对，因为他一定会欺骗我的主人；也不合理，因为只有傻瓜才这么做；也不符合基督精神，因为这是把基督徒的钱送给一个邪教徒。”</p> 
<p>“不管怎样，总得跟他结帐，你必须照我的话办，不能自作主张，”剥夺继承权的骑士说。</p> 
<p>“那好吧，我去，”葛四说，把钱袋藏在大褂里，走出了帐篷。“这件事不好办，”他嘟哝道，“不过既然让我跟他结帐，我可以照他开的价钱只付他一半。”他一边这么说，一边便动身了。剥夺继承权的骑士独自呆在那儿想心事，不过这心里带有特别烦恼和痛苦的性质，一时说不清楚，只能让读者自己去领会了。</p> 
<p>现在我们必须把场面转往阿什贝镇，或者不如说它郊外的一幢乡村别墅了，那是一个以色列富商的房屋，以撒、他的女儿和随从们目前便借住在这里——大家知道，犹太人对本民族的人，一向是慷慨而仁慈的／尽管对他们所说的外邦人，他们十分刻薄和小气，觉得这些人既然对他们不仁不义，他们也就没有必要对这些人太客气了。</p> 
<p>这时父女俩所在的那间屋于，诚然不太宽敞，但布置得富丽堂皇，具有东方色彩；房间周围有一圈比地面略高的平台，上面堆满了一叠叠绣花软垫，像西班牙人的起居室，用它们代替椅子和凳子。丽贝卡坐在一堆软垫上，露出忧虑而孝顺的目光，注视着父亲的动作；后者在室内踱来踱去，神情颓丧，步履螨跚，有时握紧了双手，有时抬起眼睛望望屋顶，仿佛心事重重，不知如何是好。 “唉，雅各啊！”他喊道，“我们宗族的十二列祖哟(注)！对一个从不违背摩西的律法，一向循规蹈矩的人说来，这是多大的损失啊！这个暴君，他伸出爪子，一下子从我手中抢走了五十个金币！”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)据《圣经》传说，犹太人的始祖是亚伯拉罕，亚伯拉罕生子以撒，以微生子雅各，雅各生子十二人，即为犹太十二宗族的祖先，见《创世记》第49章。</p> 
<p>“但是，父亲，”丽贝卡说，“我看你好像是自愿把金币给约翰亲王的呢。”</p> 
<p>“自愿！让埃及的疫病降临在他身上吧！你说我是自愿的？对，就像我从前把货物丢进里昂湾一样，也是自愿的，因为我的商船遇到了暴风雨，为了减轻船的重量，我只得把它们丢进水里，把我最好的丝绸送给翻腾的波浪穿，把我的沉香和没药喂它的白沫，把我的金银器皿抛进它的无底洞！尽管这是我亲手作出的牺牲，难道我就不痛心吗？”</p> 
<p>“但这是上帝为了挽救我们的生命，要我们作出的牺牲，”丽贝卡答道，“后来我们祖先的上帝便一直保佑你。让你生意兴隆，发了大财。”</p> 
<p>“对，”以撒答道，“但是如果这个暴君像今天这样把它们抢走，一边掠夺我，一边还强迫我装出笑脸呢？唉，女儿啊，我们给剥夺了家园，到处流浪，但是我们的最大灾难，还是在我们被侮辱被掠夺的时候，我们周围的整个世界却在嘲笑我们，在我们应该挺起腰杆进行报复的时候，我们却不得不克制受损害的感觉，装出笑脸忍受一切。”</p> 
<p>“别这么想吧，爸爸，”丽贝卡说，“我们也有自己的有利条件。这些残忍的外帮人尽管可以压迫我们，在一定程度上还得依靠我们这些流浪的犹太人，这些他们所鄙视和迫害的人。没有我们的金钱的支持，他们就既不能在战争中维持他们的大量军队，也不能在和平时期享受胜利的幸福；我们借给他们的钱却会增加我们的财富。我们像野草一样不怕踩踏，越踩踏生得越茂盛。就拿今天的比武说吧，没有被鄙视的犹太人的资助，它就不可能举办。”</p> 
<p>“女儿呀，”以撒说，“你又触及了另一根伤心的琴弦。那匹精壮的战马和那套贵重的盔甲，相当于我跟莱斯特的吉尔约斯·贾拉姆做的那笔买卖的全部利润呢。唉，这又是一笔亏本生意，它的损失吞没了我从一个安息日到另一个安息日的整个礼拜的收入。不过结果也许会比我现在想象的好，因为那是一个好青年。”</p> 
<p>“我相信，”丽贝卡说，“你为了报答陌生骑士为你做的好事，是不会后悔的。”</p> 
<p>“我相信这样，女儿，”以撒说，“我也相信锡安的重建(注)，但是正如我希望亲眼看到新神殿的城墙和雉谍只是空想一样，我也不能指望一个基督徒，对，哪怕是最好的基督徒，会给犹太人还债，除非在法律和监狱的威胁下。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)锡安是耶路撒冷的一座山，又译郎山，从前是犹太王国的政治和宗教中心，建有王宫及神殿，后为罗马帝国摧毁，但犹太人相信“锡安必蒙救赎”（见《旧约·以赛亚书》），因此犹太民族的复兴便以重建锡安为号召。</p> 
<p>说到这里，他又开始迈着不满的步子在屋内踱来踱去了；丽贝卡发现，她本想安慰他，反而勾起了新的牢骚涸此明智地放弃了徒劳无益的努力——这种适可而止的态度，值得推荐给每个企图充当安慰者和忠告者的人，在遇到类似情况时参照执行。</p> 
<p>现在暮色逐渐浓了，一个犹太仆人走进屋子，把两盏银台灯放到了桌上，灯里用的是香油；同时另一个以色列仆人在一张镶银的小乌木桌上，摆开了最珍贵的美酒和一些精致细巧的食品；因为犹太人在自己家中是非常阔绰，从不拒绝任何奢侈享受的。这时仆人还向以撒报告，一个拿撒勒人(注)（他们在自己人中间谈到基督徒便这么称呼他们）要见他。凡是做买卖的，必须随时准备接见每一个要与他谈生意的人。以撒正把一杯希腊名酒举到唇边，还没尝一口，马上又把它放回了桌上，匆匆叮嘱女儿戴上面纱，然后吩咐让陌生人进屋。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)根据《新约全书》，耶稣的故乡是拿撒勒，因此耶稣有时便被称作拿撒勒人，犹太教徒也把基督教徒都称作拿撒勒人。</p> 
<p>丽贝卡刚把一块垂到脚边的银色薄纱放下，让它遮没美丽的脸庞，门便开了，葛四走了进来，宽大的诺曼斗篷重重叠叠地裹在他的身上，那副样子叫人看了很不舒服，简直显得形迹可疑，尤其是他一进屋，非但不摘下帽子，还把帽檐拉到了乱蓬蓬的眉毛上面。</p> 
<p>“你是约克的犹太人以撒吗？’噶四用撒克逊语说。</p> 
<p>“正是，”以撒用同样的语言回答润为他的买卖使他必须懂得在不列颠使用的各种语言，“你是谁？”</p> 
<p>“这无关紧要，”葛四回答。</p> 
<p>“可是这像你要知道我的名字一样重要，”以撒回答，“不知道你的名字，我怎么跟你交谈呢？”</p> 
<p>“很简单，”葛回答道，“我是来付钱的，我必须知道钱交到了本人手里；你是收钱的，我想，你就不必管钱是谁送来的了。”</p> 
<p>“哦，”犹太人说，“你是来付钱的？我的祖宗亚伯拉罕啊！这就改变了我们之间的关系。那么是谁派你送钱来的呢？”</p> 
<p>“今天比武大会上的优胜者，剥夺继承权的骑士派我送来的，”葛四说。“这是由你担保，莱斯特的吉尔约斯·贾拉姆借给他的那套盔甲的钱。那匹马已送回你的马厩了。我现在需要知道，我得为那套盔甲付多少钱。”</p> 
<p>“我说过他是一个好青年！”以撒高兴得喊了起来。“你喝一杯，这对你没坏处，”他又说，斟了满满一杯酒递给放猪的，葛四有生以来还从未喝过这么好的酒。“那么你身边带了多少钱？”</p> 
<p>“圣母马利亚啊！”葛四说，放下了酒杯，“这些不信基督的东西喝的简直是琼浆玉液，真正的基督徒喝的啤酒却跟喂猪的泔脚一样浑浊！我带着多少钱？”撒克逊人发表了那些不太客气的感想以后，继续道，“不多，就手头这一点。不过，以撒，你可得把良心放在中间，尽管这只是一颗犹太人的心。”</p> 
<p>“别这么讲，”以撒说，“你的主人凭他那条枪和那只右胳膊，已赢了几匹出色的战马，几套贵重的盔甲，当然，他是个好青年，我可以替他把这些全换成现钱，扣除他应付的，多余的全还给他。”</p> 
<p>“我的主人已经把它们统统卖了，”葛四说。</p> 
<p>“啊！那可不对，”犹太人说，“傻瓜才这么做。这里没有一个基督徒买得起这么多的马和盔甲，也没有一个犹太人肯出我一半的价钱。但是你那只袋子里藏着一百个金币呢，”以撒又说，在葛四的大褂下摸了一把，“它怪沉的。”</p> 
<p>“那里边装的是石弓的弹头呢，”葛四早有准备地说。</p> 
<p>“那好吧，”以撒说，喘了口气，在贪得无厌的习性和眼前这事引起的新的慷慨心理之间犹豫不决，“如果我为那匹马的租费和那套盔甲，开价八十枚金币，这一个钱也没赚你的，你付得出吗？”</p> 
<p>“勉强可以，”葛四说，尽管这价钱比他预计的已公道得多，“这么一来，我的主人便一文钱也不剩了。不过这既然是你的最低价钱，我不再计较了。”</p> 
<p>“请你再喝一杯，”犹太人说。“不过八十枚金币实在太少。我垫了款子，连一个钱的利息也没算。再说，那匹马在今天的交战中可能已受了点伤。啊，这场比赛惊心动魄，好不危险！人和马都像巴珊的野牛似的冲向对方！那匹马不可能不受点伤。”</p> 
<p>“听我说，”葛四答道，“它完好无损，呼吸平稳，四肢照旧，你不妨现在就到马厩看看。此外我还得说，那套盔甲也不过值七十枚金币；我相信，一个基督徒的话也像犹太人的一样诚实。如果你还嫌少，我只得把这袋金币带回去（他把钱袋摇得叮当直响），交还我的主人了。”</p> 
<p>“别忙，别忙！”以撒说，“放下袋子，就算八十枚金币吧，你瞧，我对你够大方的了。”</p> 
<p>葛四终于同意了，数出了八十枚金币放在桌上，犹太人给了他收据，包括马的租费和盔甲的钱。他高兴得手直发抖，先把七十枚金币包好。剩下的十枚，他每拿起一个，便仔细掂掂重量，停一会，又叨咕一句，这才放进钱包。看样子，他的贪婪心理正在与他较好的天性搏斗，前者迫使他把金币一枚接一枚地放进口袋，后者又要求他至少得留下几个，还给他的恩人，或者作为赏金送给他的代理人。他的话归纳起来大致这样：</p> 
<p>“七十一，七十二——你的主人是一个好青年——七十三——一个正直的青年——七十四——这一枚的边剪过了——七十五——这一枚好像份量不足——七十六—— 你的主人什么时候要用钱，叫他尽管来找约克的以撒好了——七十七——当然，得有可靠的抵押。”说到这里，他停了好一会儿，葛四满心欢喜，以为这三枚可以避免它们那些伙伴的命运了，但是计数又继续了：“七十八——你是一个好人——七十九——应该给你点什么——”</p> 
<p>这时犹太人又停了一会，打量着最后一枚金币，无疑打算把它送给葛四。他在手指上掂了掂它的分量，又把它丢在桌上，听了听声音。要是声音不够清脆，或者分量轻那么一点儿，慷慨心理也许会占上风，可是活该葛四倒霉，那枚金币声音既响又脆，样子圆鼓鼓的，刚铸成不久，还比别的重了一些。以撒怎么也舍不得与它分开，装出心不在焉的神气，又把它丢进了钱包，一边说道：“八十枚一个不少，我相信你的主人会好好酬劳你的。不过，”他又仔细打量了一下葛四的钱袋，说道： “你的袋子里还有金币、吧？”</p> 
<p>葛四咧开了嘴，似笑非笑地答道：“跟你刚才点过的数目差不多。”然后他折好收据，把它放在帽子下，又说道；“别贪心不足，犹太佬，要知道付给你的已经够多的了！”他又自己动手斟了一杯酒，喝干以后没谢一声便走了。</p> 
<p>“丽贝卡，”犹太人说道，“我叫那个以实玛利人给耍啦。不过他的主人是个好青年；对，我很高兴，他单枪匹马赢了不少金币；他那支枪好不厉害，跟非利士人歌利亚(注)使的那支一样、粗得可以比作织布机上的卷轴了。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)《圣经》中提到的非利士人的大力士，曾使以色列人屡屡战败，后为大卫击杀。据说他力大无穷，使的枪“枪杆粗如机轴”（见《撒母耳记上》第17章）。</p> 
<p>他听不到丽贝卡回答，扭头一看，这才发现，在他与葛四讨价还价的时候，她早已悄悄离开了屋子。</p> 
<p>这时葛四走下了楼梯，正经过黑沉沉的前室或客厅，发现有人在向他招手，这人一身雪白的，手里拿了一盏小银灯，要他到旁边一间屋里去。葛四有些惶惑，不想理睬那人。他虽说像野猪一样粗鲁和大胆，除了人间的暴力什么也不怕，但具有撒克逊人的特点，对山妖鬼怪，白衣女人，以及他的祖先从日耳曼荒山野林中带来的一切迷信观念，怀有天生的恐惧心理。他又蓦地想起，他是在犹太人的家里，这些人除了大家通常赋予他们的种种恶劣品质，还被当作了神秘莫测的巫师和妖人。然而迟疑片刻之后，他还是服从了鬼怪的召唤，跟她走进了她指的那间屋子，使他大喜过望的是他发现，在前领路的便是他在比武大会上见过的漂亮的犹太姑娘，刚才她也在她父亲的屋子里。</p> 
<p>她询问了他和以撒谈判的情形，他仔细讲了一遍。</p> 
<p>“我的父亲只是与你开玩笑的，朋友，”丽贝卡说，“他欠了你主人很大的恩情，不是一匹战马和一套盔甲抵消得了的，哪怕它们的价值增加十倍。你现在付了我父亲多少钱？”</p> 
<p>“八十枚金币，”葛四说，对她的问题感到诧异。</p> 
<p>“这只袋子里有一百枚金币，”丽贝卡说，“你把你的主人应该拿的那部分还给他，多下的就给你吧。你得赶快走，别站在这里说什么感谢啦！你穿过这个拥挤的市镇时，路上得多加小心，你的钱包和性命都难免遭遇不测。鲁本，”她拍了拍手，又喊道，“拿灯送这个陌生人出去，等他走后别忘记阿好门，加上锁。”</p> 
<p>鲁本应声而来，这是个棕色皮肤、黑胡子的以色列人，手里拿着一个火把；他打开通往外边的门，带葛四穿过铺石板的院子，让他从大门上的一扇小门出去后，立即闩上门，加上了铁链，仿佛那是一座监狱。</p> 
<p>“我的圣邓斯坦呀！”葛四在黑暗的街上一边想，一边跌跌撞撞走去，“那不是犹太姑娘，简直是天上下来的仙女！勇敢的少东家给了我十枚金币，漂亮的犹太仙女又给了我二十枚！啊，今天运气真好！再有这么一天，葛四，你就可以赎身啦，你可以堂堂正正做个自由人，谁也管不了你啦。到那时我便得丢下放猪的号角和木棍，拿起自由人的剑和盾牌，跟随少东家去战斗，不必隐姓埋名，也不必把脸藏起来了。”</p>
