She Stoops to Conquer</p> 
<p>When the Templar reached the hall of the castle, he found De Bracy already there. "Your love-suit," said De Bracy, "hath, I suppose, been disturbed, like mine, by this obstreperous summons. But you have come later and more reluctantly, and therefore I presume your interview has proved more agreeable than mine."</p> 
<p>"Has your suit, then, been unsuccessfully paid to the Saxon heiress?" said the Templar.</p> 
<p>"By the bones of Thomas a Becket," answered De Bracy, "the Lady Rowena must have heard that I cannot endure the sight of women's tears."</p> 
<p>"Away!" said the Templar; "thou a leader of a Free Company, and regard a woman's tears! A few drops sprinkled on the torch of love, make the flame blaze the brighter."</p> 
<p>"Gramercy for the few drops of thy sprinkling," replied De Bracy; "but this damsel hath wept enough to extinguish a beacon-light. Never was such wringing of hands and such overflowing of eyes, since the days of St Niobe, of whom Prior Aymer told us.*</p> 
<p>* I wish the Prior had also informed them when Niobe was * sainted. Probably during that enlightened period when * "Pan to Moses lent his pagan horn." L. T.</p> 
<p>A water-fiend hath possessed the fair Saxon."</p> 
<p>"A legion of fiends have occupied the bosom of the Jewess," replied the Templar; "for, I think no single one, not even Apollyon himself, could have inspired such indomitable pride and resolution.---But where is Front-de-Boeuf? That horn is sounded more and more clamorously."</p> 
<p>"He is negotiating with the Jew, I suppose," replied De Bracy, coolly; "probably the howls of Isaac have drowned the blast of the bugle. Thou mayst know, by experience, Sir Brian, that a Jew parting with his treasures on such terms as our friend Front-de-Boeuf is like to offer, will raise a clamour loud enough to be heard over twenty horns and trumpets to boot. But we will make the vassals call him."</p> 
<p>They were soon after joined by Front-de-Boeuf, who had been disturbed in his tyrannic cruelty in the manner with which the reader is acquainted, and had only tarried to give some necessary directions.</p> 
<p>"Let us see the cause of this cursed clamour," said Front-de-Boeuf---"here is a letter, and, if I mistake not, it is in Saxon."</p> 
<p>He looked at it, turning it round and round as if he had had really some hopes of coming at the meaning by inverting the position of the paper, and then handed it to De Bracy.</p> 
<p>"It may be magic spells for aught I know," said De Bracy, who possessed his full proportion of the ignorance which characterised the chivalry of the period. "Our chaplain attempted to teach me to write," he said, "but all my letters were formed like spear-heads and sword-blades, and so the old shaveling gave up the task."</p> 
<p>"Give it me," said the Templar. "We have that of the priestly character, that we have some knowledge to enlighten our valour."</p> 
<p>"Let us profit by your most reverend knowledge, then," said De Bracy; "what says the scroll?"</p> 
<p>"It is a formal letter of defiance," answered the Templar; "but, by our Lady of Bethlehem, if it be not a foolish jest, it is the most extraordinary cartel that ever was sent across the drawbridge of a baronial castle."</p> 
<p>"Jest!" said Front-de-Boeuf, "I would gladly know who dares jest with me in such a matter!---Read it, Sir Brian."</p> 
<p>The Templar accordingly read it as follows:---"I, Wamba, the son of Witless, Jester to a noble and free-born man, Cedric of Rotherwood, called the Saxon,---And I, Gurth, the son of Beowulph, the swineherd------"</p> 
<p>"Thou art mad," said Front-de-Boeuf, interrupting the reader.</p> 
<p>"By St Luke, it is so set down," answered the Templar. Then resuming his task, he went on,---"I, Gurth, the son of Beowulph, swineherd unto the said Cedric, with the assistance of our allies and confederates, who make common cause with us in this our feud, namely, the good knight, called for the present 'Le Noir Faineant', and the stout yeoman, Robert Locksley, called Cleave-the-Wand. Do you, Reginald Front de-Boeuf, and your allies and accomplices whomsoever, to wit, that whereas you have, without cause given or feud declared, wrongfully and by mastery seized upon the person of our lord and master the said Cedric; also upon the person of a noble and freeborn damsel, the Lady Rowena of Hargottstandstede; also upon the person of a noble and freeborn man, Athelstane of Coningsburgh; also upon the persons of certain freeborn men, their 'cnichts'; also upon certain serfs, their born bondsmen; also upon a certain Jew, named Isaac of York, together with his daughter, a Jewess, and certain horses and mules: Which noble persons, with their 'cnichts' and slaves, and also with the horses and mules, Jew and Jewess beforesaid, were all in peace with his majesty, and travelling as liege subjects upon the king's highway; therefore we require and demand that the said noble persons, namely, Cedric of Rotherwood, Rowena of Hargottstandstede, Athelstane of Coningsburgh, with their servants, 'cnichts', and followers, also the horses and mules, Jew and Jewess aforesaid, together with all goods and chattels to them pertaining, be, within an hour after the delivery hereof, delivered to us, or to those whom we shall appoint to receive the same, and that untouched and unharmed in body and goods. Failing of which, we do pronounce to you, that we hold ye as robbers and traitors, and will wager our bodies against ye in battle, siege, or otherwise, and do our utmost to your annoyance and destruction. Wherefore may God have you in his keeping.---Signed by us upon the eve of St Withold's day, under the great trysting oak in the Hart-hill Walk, the above being written by a holy man, Clerk to God, our Lady, and St Dunstan, in the Chapel of Copmanhurst."</p> 
<p>At the bottom of this document was scrawled, in the first place, a rude sketch of a cock's head and comb, with a legend expressing this hieroglyphic to be the sign-manual of Wamba, son of Witless. Under this respectable emblem stood a cross, stated to be the mark of Gurth, the son of Beowulph. Then was written, in rough bold characters, the words, "Le Noir Faineant". And, to conclude the whole, an arrow, neatly enough drawn, was described as the mark of the yeoman Locksley.</p> 
<p>The knights heard this uncommon document read from end to end, and then gazed upon each other in silent amazement, as being utterly at a loss to know what it could portend. De Bracy was the first to break silence by an uncontrollable fit of laughter, wherein he was joined, though with more moderation, by the Templar. Front-de-Boeuf, on the contrary, seemed impatient of their ill-timed jocularity.</p> 
<p>"I give you plain warning," he said, "fair sirs, that you had better consult how to bear yourselves under these circumstances, than give way to such misplaced merriment."</p> 
<p>"Front-de-Boeuf has not recovered his temper since his late overthrow," said De Bracy to the Templar; "he is cowed at the very idea of a cartel, though it come but from a fool and a swineherd."</p> 
<p>"By St Michael," answered Front-de-Boeuf, "I would thou couldst stand the whole brunt of this adventure thyself, De Bracy. These fellows dared not have acted with such inconceivable impudence, had they not been supported by some strong bands. There are enough of outlaws in this forest to resent my protecting the deer. I did but tie one fellow, who was taken redhanded and in the fact, to the horns of a wild stag, which gored him to death in five minutes, and I had as many arrows shot at me as there were launched against yonder target at Ashby.---Here, fellow," he added, to one of his attendants, "hast thou sent out to see by what force this precious challenge is to be supported?"</p> 
<p>"There are at least two hundred men assembled in the woods," answered a squire who was in attendance.</p> 
<p>"Here is a proper matter!" said Front-de-Boeuf, "this comes of lending you the use of my castle, that cannot manage your undertaking quietly, but you must bring this nest of hornets about my ears!"</p> 
<p>"Of hornets?" said De Bracy; "of stingless drones rather; a band of lazy knaves, who take to the wood, and destroy the venison rather than labour for their maintenance."</p> 
<p>"Stingless!" replied Front-de-Boeuf; "fork-headed shafts of a cloth-yard in length, and these shot within the breadth of a French crown, are sting enough."</p> 
<p>"For shame, Sir Knight!" said the Templar. "Let us summon our people, and sally forth upon them. One knight---ay, one man-at-arms, were enough for twenty such peasants."</p> 
<p>"Enough, and too much," said De Bracy; "I should only be ashamed to couch lance against them."</p> 
<p>"True," answered Front-de-Boeuf; "were they black Turks or Moors, Sir Templar, or the craven peasants of France, most valiant De Bracy; but these are English yeomen, over whom we shall have no advantage, save what we may derive from our arms and horses, which will avail us little in the glades of the forest. Sally, saidst thou? we have scarce men enough to defend the castle. The best of mine are at York; so is all your band, De Bracy; and we have scarcely twenty, besides the handful that were engaged in this mad business."</p> 
<p>"Thou dost not fear," said the Templar, "that they can assemble in force sufficient to attempt the castle?"</p> 
<p>"Not so, Sir Brian," answered Front-de-Boeuf. "These outlaws have indeed a daring captain; but without machines, scaling ladders, and experienced leaders, my castle may defy them."</p> 
<p>"Send to thy neighbours," said the Templar, "let them assemble their people, and come to the rescue of three knights, besieged by a jester and a swineherd in the baronial castle of Reginald Front-de-Boeuf!"</p> 
<p>"You jest, Sir Knight," answered the baron; "but to whom should I send?---Malvoisin is by this time at York with his retainers, and so are my other allies; and so should I have been, but for this infernal enterprise."</p> 
<p>"Then send to York, and recall our people," said De Bracy. "If they abide the shaking of my standard, or the sight of my Free Companions, I will give them credit for the boldest outlaws ever bent bow in green-wood."</p> 
<p>"And who shall bear such a message?" said Front-de-Boeuf; "they will beset every path, and rip the errand out of his bosom.---I have it," he added, after pausing for a moment---"Sir Templar, thou canst write as well as read, and if we can but find the writing materials of my chaplain, who died a twelvemonth since in the midst of his Christmas carousals---"</p> 
<p>"So please ye," said the squire, who was still in attendance, "I think old Urfried has them somewhere in keeping, for love of the confessor. He was the last man, I have heard her tell, who ever said aught to her, which man ought in courtesy to address to maid or matron."</p> 
<p>"Go, search them out, Engelred," said Front-de-Boeuf; "and then, Sir Templar, thou shalt return an answer to this bold challenge."</p> 
<p>"I would rather do it at the sword's point than at that of the pen," said Bois-Guilbert; "but be it as you will."</p> 
<p>He sat down accordingly, and indited, in the French language, an epistle of the following tenor:---"Sir Reginald Front-de-Boeuf, with his noble and knightly allies and confederates, receive no defiances at the hands of slaves, bondsmen, or fugitives. If the person calling himself the Black Knight have indeed a claim to the honours of chivalry, he ought to know that he stands degraded by his present association, and has no right to ask reckoning at the hands of good men of noble blood. Touching the prisoners we have made, we do in Christian charity require you to send a man of religion, to receive their confession, and reconcile them with God; since it is our fixed intention to execute them this morning before noon, so that their heads being placed on the battlements, shall show to all men how lightly we esteem those who have bestirred themselves in their rescue. Wherefore, as above, we require you to send a priest to reconcile them to God, in doing which you shall render them the last earthly service."</p> 
<p>This letter being folded, was delivered to the squire, and by him to the messenger who waited without, as the answer to that which he had brought.</p> 
<p>The yeoman having thus accomplished his mission, returned to the head-quarters of the allies, which were for the present established under a venerable oak-tree, about three arrow-flights distant from the castle. Here Wamba and Gurth, with their allies the Black Knight and Locksley, and the jovial hermit, awaited with impatience an answer to their summons. Around, and at a distance from them, were seen many a bold yeoman, whose silvan dress and weatherbeaten countenances showed the ordinary nature of their occupation. More than two hundred had already assembled, and others were fast coming in. Those whom they obeyed as leaders were only distinguished from the others by a feather in the cap, their dress, arms, and equipments being in all other respects the same.</p> 
<p>Besides these bands, a less orderly and a worse armed force, consisting of the Saxon inhabitants of the neighbouring township, as well as many bondsmen and servants from Cedric's extensive estate, had already arrived, for the purpose of assisting in his rescue. Few of these were armed otherwise than with such rustic weapons as necessity sometimes converts to military purposes. Boar-spears, scythes, flails, and the like, were their chief arms; for the Normans, with the usual policy of conquerors, were jealous of permitting to the vanquished Saxons the possession or the use of swords and spears. These circumstances rendered the assistance of the Saxons far from being so formidable to the besieged, as the strength of the men themselves, their superior numbers, and the animation inspired by a just cause, might otherwise well have made them. It was to the leaders of this motley army that the letter of the Templar was now delivered.</p> 
<p>Reference was at first made to the chaplain for an exposition of its contents.</p> 
<p>"By the crook of St Dunstan," said that worthy ecclesiastic, "which hath brought more sheep within the sheepfold than the crook of e'er another saint in Paradise, I swear that I cannot expound unto you this jargon, which, whether it be French or Arabic, is beyond my guess."</p> 
<p>He then gave the letter to Gurth, who shook his head gruffly, and passed it to Wamba. The Jester looked at each of the four corners of the paper with such a grin of affected intelligence as a monkey is apt to assume upon similar occasions, then cut a caper, and gave the letter to Locksley.</p> 
<p>"If the long letters were bows, and the short letters broad arrows, I might know something of the matter," said the brave yeoman; "but as the matter stands, the meaning is as safe, for me, as the stag that's at twelve miles distance."</p> 
<p>"I must be clerk, then," said the Black Knight; and taking the letter from Locksley, he first read it over to himself, and then explained the meaning in Saxon to his confederates.</p> 
<p>"Execute the noble Cedric!" exclaimed Wamba; "by the rood, thou must be mistaken, Sir Knight."</p> 
<p>"Not I, my worthy friend," replied the knight, "I have explained the words as they are here set down."</p> 
<p>"Then, by St Thomas of Canterbury," replied Gurth, "we will have the castle, should we tear it down with our hands!"</p> 
<p>"We have nothing else to tear it with," replied Wamba; "but mine are scarce fit to make mammocks of freestone and mortar."</p> 
<p>"'Tis but a contrivance to gain time," said Locksley; "they dare not do a deed for which I could exact a fearful penalty."</p> 
<p>"I would," said the Black Knight, "there were some one among us who could obtain admission into the castle, and discover how the case stands with the besieged. Methinks, as they require a confessor to be sent, this holy hermit might at once exercise his pious vocation, and procure us the information we desire."</p> 
<p>"A plague on thee, and thy advice!" said the pious hermit; "I tell thee, Sir Slothful Knight, that when I doff my friar's frock, my priesthood, my sanctity, my very Latin, are put off along with it; and when in my green jerkin, I can better kill twenty deer than confess one Christian."</p> 
<p>"I fear," said the Black Knight, "I fear greatly, there is no one here that is qualified to take upon him, for the nonce, this same character of father confessor?"</p> 
<p>All looked on each other, and were silent.</p> 
<p>"I see," said Wamba, after a short pause, "that the fool must be still the fool, and put his neck in the venture which wise men shrink from. You must know, my dear cousins and countrymen, that I wore russet before I wore motley, and was bred to be a friar, until a brain-fever came upon me and left me just wit enough to be a fool. I trust, with the assistance of the good hermit's frock, together with the priesthood, sanctity, and learning which are stitched into the cowl of it, I shall be found qualified to administer both worldly and ghostly comfort to our worthy master Cedric, and his companions in adversity."</p> 
<p>"Hath he sense enough, thinkst thou?" said the Black Knight, addressing Gurth.</p> 
<p>"I know not," said Gurth; "but if he hath not, it will be the first time he hath wanted wit to turn his folly to account."</p> 
<p>"On with the frock, then, good fellow," quoth the Knight, "and let thy master send us an account of their situation within the castle. Their numbers must be few, and it is five to one they may be accessible by a sudden and bold attack. Time wears---away with thee."</p> 
<p>"And, in the meantime," said Locksley, "we will beset the place so closely, that not so much as a fly shall carry news from thence. So that, my good friend," he continued, addressing Wamba, "thou mayst assure these tyrants, that whatever violence they exercise on the persons of their prisoners, shall be most severely repaid upon their own."</p> 
<p>"Pax vobiscum," said Wamba, who was now muffled in his religious disguise.</p> 
<p>And so saying he imitated the solemn and stately deportment of a friar, and departed to execute his mission.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>这么诘屈聱牙、艰涩古奥的笔法，</p> 
<p>我平生还是第一次拜读！</p> 
<p>《委曲求全》(注)</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)英国著名作家哥尔德斯密斯（1730—1774）的一出喜剧。</p> 
<p>圣殿骑士到达城堡的大厅时，发现德布拉酉已在那儿。“我想，”德布拉西说，”你的求婚也像我的一样，给这阵喧哗的号角声打断了。但你来得比我退，又那么勉强，我猜想，你的谈判一定比我的顺利一些。”</p> 
<p>“那么你向撒克逊女继承人提出的求婚，没有获得成功？”圣殿骑士说。</p> 
<p>“凭托马斯·贝克特(注)的圣骸起誓，”德布拉西答道，“罗文娜小姐一定听说，我看到女人的眼泪便会受不了。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)英国政治家，1061—70年任坎特伯雷大主教，因反对英王亨利二世被处死，后由罗马教廷追溢为圣徒。</p> 
<p>“废话！”圣殿骑士说，“你这么一个雇佣兵的首领，还怕女人的眼泪！爱情的火炬上洒几滴眼泪，火会烧得更旺，更明亮。”</p> 
<p>“对不起，什么几滴眼泪，”德布拉西答道，“这位小姐的眼泪已经多得可以把一堆篝火都浇灭了。我还从没见过谁的手会这么绞个不停，谁的眼泪会这么淌个没完，艾默长老给我们讲过圣尼俄柏的事，(注)那么只有她能与这位小姐相比了。这个撒克逊美女简直哭成一个泪人儿啦。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)我希望长老也能告诉我们，尼俄柏是什么时候封为圣徒的。大概是在“潘神把他异教的角借给了摩西”的那个文明时期吧。——原注</p> 
<p>按尼俄柏是希腊神话中的一个母亲，她生了七千七女，后因得罪了神，他们全给杀死，因此厄俄柏整天哭泣。潘神也是希腊神话中的人物，他是山林之神，他的身体是人，腿和脚是羊，头上生着角。《旧约·出埃及记》第34章第29节有一句话：“摩西从西奈山下来时，脸上发光，”但在最早的拉丁文译本（即所谓《武甘大圣经》）中，译者误解了希伯来文原意，把这句话译成了“头上生着两只角的摩西走下西奈山”。司各特的这条附注是在讽刺艾默长老等不学无术，把希腊神话中的（也就是异教时代的）人物称作圣徒，正如《武甘大圣经》的译者误解希伯来文，把异教的潘神头上的角移到了摩西的头上一样。</p> 
<p>“可是我那个犹太姑娘不是朝我哭，是向我大发脾气呢，”圣殿骑士答道。“我想，从古到今没有一个人，包括亚巴顿(注)在内，会这么盛气凌人，坚定不屈。但是牛面将军在哪儿啊？这号角越吹越来劲啦。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)又称亚玻伦，《新约》中提到的无底洞的魔王（见《启示录》第9章）。</p> 
<p>“我想，他正在跟犹太佬谈判呢，”德布拉西冷静地答道，“也许以撒的嚎叫淹没了号角的声音。你凭经验也知道，布里恩爵士，一个犹太人要在我们的朋友牛面将军这种人提出的条件下，与自己的财产告别的时候，会怎么大喊大叫，超过二十只号角加上二十只喇叭的响声。但是我们不妨派听差去叫他一声。”</p> 
<p>不多一会，牛面将军就来了，他在行使酷刑的时候，怎样给号角声打断，读者已经知道了；只是为了作些必要的安排，他才来迟了一步。</p> 
<p>“让我们看看，这该死的号角声究竟是为了什么，”牛面将军说，“我收到了一封信，如果我没有猜错，它是用撒克逊文写的。”</p> 
<p>他望着信，把它翻过来倒过去，转了好几个圈，仿佛他真的以为，只要把那张纸掉几个头，就可以懂得它的意思似的，最后他把它交给了德布拉西。</p> 
<p>“这写的是什么咒语，我一点也不懂，”德布拉西说，因为他与当时的其他骑士并无不同，他们的共同特点便是不通文墨。“我们的神父想教我写字，”他说，“但我的字写得歪歪斜斜，乱七八糟，结果老头儿只得打消了主意。”</p> 
<p>“把它给我，”圣殿骑士说，“我们带有一些教士的性质，因为我们不仅得勇敢，还得具备一定的文化知识。”</p> 
<p>“那么只得劳驾你，靠你的知识来解决难题了，”德布拉西说。“这纸上讲的什么？”</p> 
<p>“这是一封正式的挑战书，”圣殿骑士答道。“但是凭伯利恒的圣母起誓，除非这是愚蠢的玩笑，否则真是一封别开生面的战书，这种东西通过吊桥递进男爵的城堡，恐怕还是破天荒第一次。”</p> 
<p>“玩笑！”牛面将军说，“我倒想听听，谁敢在这种事情上跟我开玩笑！快念，布里恩爵士。”</p> 
<p>于是圣殿骑士开始念了起来：</p> 
<p>“鄙人汪八，乃愚人之子，职业为生而自由的尊贵庄主罗瑟伍德之塞德里克老爷手下的小丑；鄙人葛四，乃贝奥武尔夫之子，职业为放猪人……”</p> 
<p>“你发什么疯！”牛面将军打断了信中的话。</p> 
<p>“凭圣路加起誓，信上是这么写的，”圣殿骑士回答，然后继续念道：“鄙人葛四，乃贝奥武尔夫之子，职业为放猪人；现会同在这场争执中与我们志同道合的盟友及伙伴，即目前暂名为黑甲懒汉的正直骑士，及号称百步穿杨的民间勇士罗伯特·洛克斯利，共同致书牛面将军雷金纳德及其一切狐群狗党，通知如下：由于尔等无缘无故挑起争端，以非法的暴力手段侵犯人身自由，劫走我们的老爷和主人塞德里克庄主，暨高贵而生来自由的哈戈斯坦之罗文娜小姐，暨高贵而生来自由的庄主科宁斯堡之阿特尔斯坦，暨其他生而自由的他们的家人，以及他们的奴仆，暨一个名为约克的以撒的犹太人及其女儿，一个犹太姑娘，并掳走了他们的马和骡子，而当时上述贵人和他们的家丁及奴隶，还有马和骡子，还有上述犹太人和犹太姑娘，均属国王陛下之安分良民，正作为合法臣民，在王国的大路上旅行；因此现特责令尔等，在收到本信后一小时内，立即向我们或我们所指定的人，交出上述贵人，即罗瑟伍德之塞德里克，哈戈斯坦之罗文娜，科宁斯堡之阿特尔斯坦，以及他们的仆人、家丁、随从，还有马和骡子，以及上述犹太人和犹太姑娘，以及属于他们的一切财物和动产，并保证他们的身体不受伤害，他们的财产不受损失。如若不然，我们向你们宣布，我们将把你们看作强盗和叛逆，并对你们实行讨伐、围攻等等，运用一切手段使你们不得安生，直至毁灭。军令如山，战书到时，望即遵照办理。本书以我等名义签发，由忠于上帝、圣母和圣邓斯坦的科普曼赫斯特教堂之虔诚神父手书，于圣维索尔特日前夕写于哈特希尔区大株树集合地。”</p> 
<p>在这文件底部，第一行上潦潦草草涂了几笔，这算是鸡头和鸡冠，它作为象形文字代表白痴之于汪八的签名。第二行是一个虔诚的十字，它是贝奥武尔夫之子葛四的签名。然后是又粗又大的几个字：黑甲懒汉。最后一行是一支勾勒得细巧精致的箭，它代表庄稼汉洛克斯利。</p> 
<p>几位骑士从头至尾听完了这篇不同寻常的妙文，一时为之愕然，作声不得，你望望我，我望望你，好像弄不清这究竟意味着什么。德布拉西首先打破沉默，发出了一阵忍俊不禁的大笑，接着圣殿骑士也笑了起来，只是声音轻一些。牛面将军却相反，似乎对这不合时宜的狂笑十分恼火。</p> 
<p>“我明确警告你们，两位先生，”他说，“在这种情况下，你们最好考虑一下该怎么办，不要嘻嘻哈哈不当一回事。”</p> 
<p>“牛面将军给上次摔下马背的事吓坏了，至今还心有余悸呢，”德布拉西对圣殿骑士说道，“他一听到挑战就怕了，尽管这只是一个傻瓜和一个放猪的发出的。”</p> 
<p>“凭圣米迦勒起誓，”牛面将军答道，“如果你能独自承担这场风险，那就好了，德布拉西。要知道，这些家伙没有强大的武力作后盾，就不敢这么肆无忌惮。这个森林里到处都是强盗，他们对我保护糜鹿本来就不满意。一个偷猎的人一旦给我当场抓到，捆住手脚，让野鹿在五分钟内把他抵死，那就不得了，无数的箭马上会向我射来，好像我是阿什贝比武场上的靶子似的。喂，小伙子，”他接着对等待回话的一个侍仆说道，“你有没有派人探听过，他们这么大胆向我挑战，究竟有多少人马？”</p> 
<p>“树林中至少聚集了两百人，”那个侍仆答道。</p> 
<p>“怪不得他们这么嚣张！”牛面将军说道。“这都是把我的城堡借给你们使用的结果，这种事不可能偷偷进行，这下可好，你们给我捅了马蜂窝，弄得它们在我耳边嗡嗡直叫！”</p> 
<p>“马蜂！”德布拉西说，“这种马蜂是不会螫人的，这只是一群懒汉，他们宁可躲在树林里偷吃鹿肉，却不肯老老实实靠干活谋生。”</p> 
<p>“不会螫人！”牛面将军答道，“一支带叉形箭头、箭杆长达三英尺的箭，从你身旁射来，这是可以螫死人的。”</p> 
<p>“真不害羞，骑士阁下！”圣殿骑士说。“我们应该把我们的人召集起来，向他们发动进攻。一个骑士——对，一个战士就足够对付二十个这种农夫。”</p> 
<p>“对，完全够了，”德布拉西说。“我只觉得用我的枪刺这些家伙太不值得呢。”</p> 
<p>“不错，”牛面将军答道，“如果他们是土耳其异教徒或者摩尔人，圣殿骑士先生，或者法国那些胆小的乡巴佬，勇敢的德布拉西，你们的话是对的。但是这些英国的庄稼人，我们占不了他们的便宜，我们的有利条件只是武器和战马，可是在森林里，这些东西都没有用武之地。你说发动进攻？但是我们的人连守住城堡都不够呢。我手下最好的战士都在约克城；德布拉西，你的部队也是这样；我们在这里的人，除了参加这次疯狂行动的几个以外，还不到二十人。”</p> 
<p>“你怕他们集合大批人马攻打城堡吗？”圣殿骑士说。</p> 
<p>“不是，布里恩爵士，”牛面将军答道。“这些强盗确实有一个骁勇的头领，但是没有登城设备，没有云梯，没有经验丰富的指挥官，我的堡垒不怕他们。”</p> 
<p>“那么派人向你的邻居讨救兵吧，”圣殿骑士说，“让他们集合人马，前来支援雷金纳德男爵的城堡，搭救被一个小丑和一个放猪的围困在这儿的三个骑士！”</p> 
<p>“不要开玩笑，骑士先生，”男爵答道。“但是叫我派人找谁？马尔沃辛已把他的部下带往约克，我的其他盟友也这样；本来我也去了，只是为了这件倒霉的事才留下。”</p> 
<p>“那就派人到约克，召回我们的人，”德布拉西说．“要是他们看见城堡上飘起我的旗帜，望见我的雇佣兵部队，还敢待在这儿不走，那我就服了他们，承认他们是最勇敢的绿林大盗。”</p> 
<p>“但是谁能把信送到呢？”牛面将军说。“他们会守住每一条道路，抓走送信的人。对，有了，”他停了一会，又道，“圣殿骑士先生，你能读信，也能写信，只要我们找到我的教士留下的文具便成；这家伙已在十二个月以前过圣诞节的时候，大吃大喝撑死了……”</p> 
<p>那个侍仆还没有走，赶紧说道：“对，我想起来了，这些文具保存在老太婆厄弗利德那里，因为她喜欢那个忏悔师。我听她讲过，他是在她面前，唯一还保持着对女人应有的礼貌的。”</p> 
<p>“去，把这些东西给我找来，恩格尔莱德，”牛面将军说。“然后，圣殿骑士先生，就请你给这大胆的挑衅回一封信。”</p> 
<p>“按我的心思，与其用笔，不如用剑回答他们，”布瓦吉贝尔说。“不过既然你要这么办，我听你的就是了。”</p> 
<p>这样，他坐了下去，用法文写了下面这封信：</p> 
<p>“牛面将军雷金纳德和他尊贵的骑士盟友及同伴，拒绝接受奴隶、仆役和逃犯的挑战书。如果那个自称为黑甲骑士的人，确实有资格称作骑士，他便应该知道，由于他所结交的那些人，他现在已无权称作骑士，也不配得到高贵血统的真正骑士的尊重了。谈到我们所囚禁的那些人，我们出于基督徒的仁慈精神，请你们派一名教士前来接受他们的临终忏悔，让他们得到上帝的赦免，因为我们已经决定，在今天中午以前把他们处死，然后把他们的头颅挂在城墙上示众，让那些自不量力要来搭救他们的人看到，我们根本不把他们的威胁放在眼里。如上所述，我们希望你们火速派一教士前来，为他们求得上帝的宽恕，这样，你们就为他们尽了人世的最后责任。”</p> 
<p>信折好后，交给了那个侍仆，由他转交等在城堡外的信使，作为对他带来的战书的答复。</p> 
<p>那个庄户人就这样完成了任务，回到了联合部队总部，它目前暂时设在一棵老株树下，离城堡大约三支箭的射程。汪八和葛四，以及他们的盟友黑甲骑士和洛克斯利，还有快活的隐士，都在那里等待回音，已等得有些不耐烦了。周围，离他们稍远的地方，可以看到许多粗犷的庄稼人，他们的森林服装和久经风霜的脸，说明他们都是普通的劳动者。聚集的已超过两百人，其余的还在迅速赶来。那些被他们公认为领袖的，除了帽子上有一根羽毛作标志以外，在服装、武器和装备方面，都与其他人并无不同。</p> 
<p>除了这几伙人，还有一些纪律较差、武器也较坏的人，这包括附近城镇的撒克逊居民，以及来自塞德里克的广阔田庄上的许多奴隶和仆役，他们也为搭救他，纷纷赶到了这儿。这些人的武器大多极其简陋，只是逼于形势才暂时用于军事目的，主要有捕捉野猪的梭镖，长柄大镰刀，连枷等等；因为诺曼人也像一般征服者，他们的方针便是竭力防止被征服的撒克逊人握有或使用刀枪剑戟等武器。这些情况大大限制了撒克逊人的力量，本来他们人数众多，声势浩大，加上是为正义事业而斗争，因此士气旺盛，可以对困守城堡的人形成巨大的威慑力量，现在却做不到了。圣殿骑士的信当时便送到了这支混合部队的领导人面前。</p> 
<p>为了弄清信的内容，首先请教了那位教士。</p> 
<p>“圣邓斯坦曾凭他的曲柄杖，引导许多绵羊进入羊栏，他的功绩超过了天国中的任何其他圣徒，”那位德高望重的圣人说道，“现在我可以凭他的曲柄杖起誓，我对这种乌七八糟的文字一点也看不懂，谁知道它是法国话还是阿拉伯语。”</p> 
<p>他随手把信递给了葛四J后者气虎虎地摇了摇头，又把它交给了汪八。小丑从信纸的一角看到另一角，装出了学识渊博的微笑，跟猴子在这种场合的表现一样，然后跳跳蹦蹦地跑到洛克斯利面前，把信丢给了他。</p> 
<p>“如果这些长字母是弓，这些短字母是箭，我也许还可凑合，懂得一点它们的意思，”勇敢的庄户人说。“可是这些玩意儿跟我无缘，就像离我十二英里远的一头鹿，到不了我手中一样。”</p> 
<p>“那么只得我来充当书记官了，”黑甲骑士说，从洛克斯利手中拿了信，先自己默读一遍，然后用撒克逊语向伙伴们作了说明。</p> 
<p>“处死尊贵的塞德里克！”汪八喊了起来，“我的老天爷，你一定搞错了，骑士先生。”</p> 
<p>“我没有搞错，我的好朋友，”骑士答道，“这都是信上的话，我是照它的意思讲的。”</p> 
<p>“那么，凭坎特伯雷的圣托马斯起誓，”葛四说道，“我们必须攻下城堡，哪怕要赤手空拳把它摧毁也得干！”</p> 
<p>“只能这么干了，”汪人答道，“可是我这双手连砸烂一块砖头也不成呀。”</p> 
<p>“这不过是拖延时间的策略罢了，”洛克斯利说，“他们不敢这么干，因为这一定会遭到我们的可怕报复。”</p> 
<p>“我希望，”黑甲骑士说，“我们中间有人能获准进入城堡，了解一下围城内的情况究竟怎样。我想，既然他们需要一位忏悔神父，这位神圣的修士可以借此机会，一边履行他的宗教职责，一边为我们收集必要的情报。”</p> 
<p>“见你的鬼，你出的什么主意！”虔诚的隐士说，“我告诉你，懒惰的骑士先生，我一脱下修士的袍子，我的教士身分，我的神圣职责，以至我的拉丁文，便跟着它一起离开我了；我穿上草绿衣服时，可以杀死二十只鹿，却不会给一个基督徒做临终忏悔。”</p> 
<p>“那就难办了，”黑甲骑士说，“这里还有谁可以担当忏悔神父的角色？”</p> 
<p>大家彼此看看，没有作声。</p> 
<p>“我想，”过了一会汪八开口道，“反正傻瓜毕竟是傻瓜，这件丢脑袋的差使聪明人不干，只得他来干了。不瞒你们说，亲爱的朋友们和乡亲们，我在穿上小丑的彩衣以前，穿过教士的粗布长袍，受过修士的教育，只是后来得了脑膜炎，才剩下这么一点头脑，只配当个傻瓜了。我相信，只要我穿上修士的袍于，附在它上面的教士身分、神圣职责，以至拉丁文，也会转到我的身上，使我具备履行教士职务的条件，为我高贵的主人塞德里克和他那些苦难的朋友提供今世和来世的安慰。”</p> 
<p>“你看他是不是神智清醒？”黑甲骑士对葛四说。</p> 
<p>“我不知道，”葛回答道，“不过如果不清醒，那么这是他生平第一次把他的胡闹用在正经事上。”</p> 
<p>“那就穿上修士的袍子吧，好小子，”骑士对汪八说，“让你的主人把城堡内的情形详细告诉我们。他们的人数一定不多，十之八九可以靠一次大胆的突然袭击拿下城堡。时间不早了，你快走吧。”</p> 
<p>“还有，”洛克斯利说，“同时我们必须严密封锁这个地方，连一只苍蝇也不让过去，免得走漏消息。这样，我的好朋友，”他又对汪八继续道，“你可以告诉那些暴徒，不论他们的俘虏受到什么伤害，他们都得为此付出最沉重的代价。”</p> 
<p>“Pax vobiscum(注)，”汪八说，现在已把身子紧紧裹在教士的长袍中了。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)拉丁文：祝你们平安。这本是耶稣复活后见到门徒时的第一句话（见《新约·马太福音》第28章），后成为教士见面时常用的问候语。汪八不懂得多少拉丁文，因此只得经常搬弄这句话。</p> 
<p>这么说完，他便模仿修士的姿势，迈着庄严而稳重的步子，出发执行任务了。</p>
