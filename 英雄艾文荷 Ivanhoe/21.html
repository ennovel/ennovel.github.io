Orra, a Tragedy</p> 
<p>The travellers had now reached the verge of the wooded country, and were about to plunge into its recesses, held dangerous at that time from the number of outlaws whom oppression and poverty had driven to despair, and who occupied the forests in such large bands as could easily bid defiance to the feeble police of the period. From these rovers, however, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour Cedric and Athelstane accounted themselves secure, as they had in attendance ten servants, besides Wamba and Gurth, whose aid could not be counted upon, the one being a jester and the other a captive. It may be added, that in travelling thus late through the forest, Cedric and Athelstane relied on their descent and character, as well as their courage. The outlaws, whom the severity of the forest laws had reduced to this roving and desperate mode of life, were chiefly peasants and yeomen of Saxon descent, and were generally supposed to respect the persons and property of their countrymen.</p> 
<p>As the travellers journeyed on their way, they were alarmed by repeated cries for assistance; and when they rode up to the place from whence they came, they were surprised to find a horse-litter placed upon the ground, beside which sat a young woman, richly dressed in the Jewish fashion, while an old man, whose yellow cap proclaimed him to belong to the same nation, walked up and down with gestures expressive of the deepest despair, and wrung his hands, as if affected by some strange disaster.</p> 
<p>To the enquiries of Athelstane and Cedric, the old Jew could for some time only answer by invoking the protection of all the patriarchs of the Old Testament successively against the sons of Ishmael, who were coming to smite them, hip and thigh, with the edge of the sword. When he began to come to himself out of this agony of terror, Isaac of York (for it was our old friend) was at length able to explain, that he had hired a body-guard of six men at Ashby, together with mules for carrying the litter of a sick friend. This party had undertaken to escort him as far as Doncaster. They had come thus far in safety; but having received information from a wood-cutter that there was a strong band of outlaws lying in wait in the woods before them, Isaac's mercenaries had not only taken flight, but had carried off with them the horses which bore the litter and left the Jew and his daughter without the means either of defence or of retreat, to be plundered, and probably murdered, by the banditti, who they expected every moment would bring down upon them. "Would it but please your valours," added Isaac, in a tone of deep humiliation, "to permit the poor Jews to travel under your safeguard, I swear by the tables of our law, that never has favour been conferred upon a child of Israel since the days of our captivity, which shall be more gratefully acknowledged."</p> 
<p>"Dog of a Jew!" said Athelstane, whose memory was of that petty kind which stores up trifles of all kinds, but particularly trifling offences, "dost not remember how thou didst beard us in the gallery at the tilt-yard? Fight or flee, or compound with the outlaws as thou dost list, ask neither aid nor company from us; and if they rob only such as thee, who rob all the world, I, for mine own share, shall hold them right honest folk."</p> 
<p>Cedric did not assent to the severe proposal of his companion. "We shall do better," said he, "to leave them two of our attendants and two horses to convey them back to the next village. It will diminish our strength but little; and with your good sword, noble Athelstane, and the aid of those who remain, it will be light work for us to face twenty of those runagates."</p> 
<p>Rowena, somewhat alarmed by the mention of outlaws in force, and so near them, strongly seconded the proposal of her guardian. But Rebecca suddenly quitting her dejected posture, and making her way through the attendants to the palfrey of the Saxon lady, knelt down, and, after the Oriental fashion in addressing superiors, kissed the hem of Rowena's garment. Then rising, and throwing back her veil, she implored her in the great name of the God whom they both worshipped, and by that revelation of the Law upon Mount Sinai, in which they both believed, that she would have compassion upon them, and suffer them to go forward under their safeguard. "It is not for myself that I pray this favour," said Rebecca; "nor is it even for that poor old man. I know that to wrong and to spoil our nation is a light fault, if not a merit, with the Christians; and what is it to us whether it be done in the city, in the desert, or in the field? But it is in the name of one dear to many, and dear even to you, that I beseech you to let this sick person be transported with care and tenderness under your protection. For, if evil chance him, the last moment of your life would be embittered with regret for denying that which I ask of you."</p> 
<p>The noble and solemn air with which Rebecca made this appeal, gave it double weight with the fair Saxon.</p> 
<p>"The man is old and feeble," she said to her guardian, "the maiden young and beautiful, their friend sick and in peril of his life---Jews though they be, we cannot as Christians leave them in this extremity. Let them unload two of the sumpter-mules, and put the baggage behind two of the serfs. The mules may transport the litter, and we have led horses for the old man and his daughter."</p> 
<p>Cedric readily assented to what she proposed, and Athelstane only added the condition, "that they should travel in the rear of the whole party, where Wamba," he said, "might attend them with his shield of boar's brawn."</p> 
<p>"I have left my shield in the tilt-yard," answered the Jester, "as has been the fate of many a better knight than myself."</p> 
<p>Athelstane coloured deeply, for such had been his own fate on the last day of the tournament; while Rowena, who was pleased in the same proportion, as if to make amends for the brutal jest of her unfeeling suitor, requested Rebecca to ride by her side.</p> 
<p>"It were not fit I should do so," answered Rebecca, with proud humility, "where my society might be held a disgrace to my protectress."</p> 
<p>By this time the change of baggage was hastily achieved; for the single word "outlaws" rendered every one sufficiently alert, and the approach of twilight made the sound yet more impressive. Amid the bustle, Gurth was taken from horseback, in the course of which removal he prevailed upon the Jester to slack the cord with which his arms were bound. It was so negligently refastened, perhaps intentionally, on the part of Wamba, that Gurth found no difficulty in freeing his arms altogether from bondage, and then, gliding into the thicket, he made his escape from the party.</p> 
<p>The bustle had been considerable, and it was some time before Gurth was missed; for, as he was to be placed for the rest of the journey behind a servant, every one supposed that some other of his companions had him under his custody, and when it began to be whispered among them that Gurth had actually disappeared, they were under such immediate expectation of an attack from the outlaws, that it was not held convenient to pay much attention to the circumstance.</p> 
<p>The path upon which the party travelled was now so narrow, as not to admit, with any sort of convenience, above two riders abreast, and began to descend into a dingle, traversed by a brook whose banks were broken, swampy, and overgrown with dwarf willows. Cedric and Athelstane, who were at the head of their retinue, saw the risk of being attacked at this pass; but neither of them having had much practice in war, no better mode of preventing the danger occurred to them than that they should hasten through the defile as fast as possible. Advancing, therefore, without much order, they had just crossed the brook with a part of their followers, when they were assailed in front, flank, and rear at once, with an impetuosity to which, in their confused and ill-prepared condition, it was impossible to offer effectual resistance. The shout of "A white dragon!---a white dragon! ---Saint George for merry England!" war-cries adopted by the assailants, as belonging to their assumed character of Saxon outlaws, was heard on every side, and on every side enemies appeared with a rapidity of advance and attack which seemed to multiply their numbers.</p> 
<p>Both the Saxon chiefs were made prisoners at the same moment, and each under circumstances expressive of his character. Cedric, the instant that an enemy appeared, launched at him his remaining javelin, which, taking better effect than that which he had hurled at Fangs, nailed the man against an oak-tree that happened to be close behind him. Thus far successful, Cedric spurred his horse against a second, drawing his sword at the same time, and striking with such inconsiderate fury, that his weapon encountered a thick branch which hung over him, and he was disarmed by the violence of his own blow. He was instantly made prisoner, and pulled from his horse by two or three of the banditti who crowded around him. Athelstane shared his captivity, his bridle having been seized, and he himself forcibly dismounted, long before he could draw his weapon, or assume any posture of effectual defence.</p> 
<p>The attendants, embarrassed with baggage, surprised and terrified at the fate of their masters, fell an easy prey to the assailants; while the Lady Rowena, in the centre of the cavalcade, and the Jew and his daughter in the rear, experienced the same misfortune.</p> 
<p>Of all the train none escaped except Wamba, who showed upon the occasion much more courage than those who pretended to greater sense. He possessed himself of a sword belonging to one of the domestics, who was just drawing it with a tardy and irresolute hand, laid it about him like a lion, drove back several who approached him, and made a brave though ineffectual attempt to succour his master. Finding himself overpowered, the Jester at length threw himself from his horse, plunged into the thicket, and, favoured by the general confusion, escaped from the scene of action. Yet the valiant Jester, as soon as he found himself safe, hesitated more than once whether he should not turn back and share the captivity of a master to whom he was sincerely attached.</p> 
<p>"I have heard men talk of the blessings of freedom," he said to himself, "but I wish any wise man would teach me what use to make of it now that I have it."</p> 
<p>As he pronounced these words aloud, a voice very near him called out in a low and cautious tone, "Wamba!" and, at the same time, a dog, which he recognised to be Fangs, jumped up and fawned upon him. "Gurth!" answered Wamba, with the same caution, and the swineherd immediately stood before him.</p> 
<p>"What is the matter?" said he eagerly; "what mean these cries, and that clashing of swords?"</p> 
<p>"Only a trick of the times," said Wamba; "they are all prisoners."</p> 
<p>"Who are prisoners?" exclaimed Gurth, impatiently.</p> 
<p>"My lord, and my lady, and Athelstane, and Hundibert, and Oswald."</p> 
<p>"In the name of God!" said Gurth, "how came they prisoners? ---and to whom?"</p> 
<p>"Our master was too ready to fight," said the Jester; "and Athelstane was not ready enough, and no other person was ready at all. And they are prisoners to green cassocks, and black visors. And they lie all tumbled about on the green, like the crab-apples that you shake down to your swine. And I would laugh at it," said the honest Jester, "if I could for weeping." And he shed tears of unfeigned sorrow.</p> 
<p>Gurth's countenance kindled---"Wamba," he said, "thou hast a weapon, and thy heart was ever stronger than thy brain,---we are only two---but a sudden attack from men of resolution will do much---follow me!"</p> 
<p>"Whither?---and for what purpose?" said the Jester.</p> 
<p>"To rescue Cedric."</p> 
<p>"But you have renounced his service but now," said Wamba.</p> 
<p>"That," said Gurth, "was but while he was fortunate---follow me!"</p> 
<p>As the Jester was about to obey, a third person suddenly made his appearance, and commanded them both to halt. From his dress and arms, Wamba would have conjectured him to be one of those outlaws who had just assailed his master; but, besides that he wore no mask, the glittering baldric across his shoulder, with the rich bugle-horn which it supported, as well as the calm and commanding expression of his voice and manner, made him, notwithstanding the twilight, recognise Locksley the yeoman, who had been victorious, under such disadvantageous circumstances, in the contest for the prize of archery.</p> 
<p>"What is the meaning of all this," said he, "or who is it that rifle, and ransom, and make prisoners, in these forests?"</p> 
<p>"You may look at their cassocks close by," said Wamba, "and see whether they be thy children's coats or no---for they are as like thine own, as one green pea-cod is to another."</p> 
<p>"I will learn that presently," answered Locksley; "and I charge ye, on peril of your lives, not to stir from the place where ye stand, until I have returned. Obey me, and it shall be the better for you and your masters.---Yet stay, I must render myself as like these men as possible."</p> 
<p>So saying he unbuckled his baldric with the bugle, took a feather from his cap, and gave them to Wamba; then drew a vizard from his pouch, and, repeating his charges to them to stand fast, went to execute his purposes of reconnoitring.</p> 
<p>"Shall we stand fast, Gurth?" said Wamba; "or shall we e'en give him leg-bail? In my foolish mind, he had all the equipage of a thief too much in readiness, to be himself a true man."</p> 
<p>"Let him be the devil," said Gurth, "an he will. We can be no worse of waiting his return. If he belong to that party, he must already have given them the alarm, and it will avail nothing either to fight or fly. Besides, I have late experience, that errant thieves are not the worst men in the world to have to deal with."</p> 
<p>The yeoman returned in the course of a few minutes.</p> 
<p>"Friend Gurth," he said, "I have mingled among yon men, and have learnt to whom they belong, and whither they are bound. There is, I think, no chance that they will proceed to any actual violence against their prisoners. For three men to attempt them at this moment, were little else than madness; for they are good men of war, and have, as such, placed sentinels to give the alarm when any one approaches. But I trust soon to gather such a force, as may act in defiance of all their precautions; you are both servants, and, as I think, faithful servants, of Cedric the Saxon, the friend of the rights of Englishmen. He shall not want English hands to help him in this extremity. Come then with me, until I gather more aid."</p> 
<p>So saying, he walked through the wood at a great pace, followed by the jester and the swineherd. It was not consistent with Wamba's humour to travel long in silence.</p> 
<p>"I think," said he, looking at the baldric and bugle which he still carried, "that I saw the arrow shot which won this gay prize, and that not so long since as Christmas."</p> 
<p>"And I," said Gurth, "could take it on my halidome, that I have heard the voice of the good yeoman who won it, by night as well as by day, and that the moon is not three days older since I did so."</p> 
<p>"Mine honest friends," replied the yeoman, "who, or what I am, is little to the present purpose; should I free your master, you will have reason to think me the best friend you have ever had in your lives. And whether I am known by one name or another ---or whether I can draw a bow as well or better than a cow-keeper, or whether it is my pleasure to walk in sunshine or by moonlight, are matters, which, as they do not concern you, so neither need ye busy yourselves respecting them."</p> 
<p>"Our heads are in the lion's mouth," said Wamba, in a whisper to Gurth, "get them out how we can."</p> 
<p>"Hush---be silent," said Gurth. "Offend him not by thy folly, and I trust sincerely that all will go well."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>一队人手执武器，风尘仆仆，</p> 
<p>正护送一贵妇人去城堡过夜；</p> 
<p>这是我一路上尾随他们，</p> 
<p>他们的片言只语中获悉的。</p> 
<p>现在这伙人已离此不远了。</p> 
<p>《奥拉，一出悲剧》</p> 
<p>旅人们终于来到了一片森林边缘，即将进入茂密的树林深处，这在那个时候被认为是非常危险的，因为压迫和贫穷使许多人沦为盗匪，啸聚在山林中，当时薄弱的治安力量根本不在他们眼里。然而尽管时间已晚，塞德里克和阿特尔斯坦仍有恃无恐，认为除了汪八和葛四一个是小丑，另一个是囚徒，不能依靠以外，他们身边还带着十个仆人，足以对付那些亡命之徒。不仅如此，塞德里克和阿特尔斯坦还认为，深夜穿过森林不足为虑，他们不仅勇敢，他们的血统和身分也对他们有利。那些强人大多是在严厉的森林法规的逼迫下走投无路，才铤而走险，过这种逃亡生活的，他们主要是撒克逊族的农夫和村民，一般说来，这些人对本族同胞的生命财产还是会手下留情的。</p> 
<p>正当这伙旅人向前赶路的时候，传来了一声声呼救的喊叫；等他们来到发出这些声音的地方，便发现一架驮舆搁在地上，旁边坐着一个衣着华丽的年轻女子，看样子是犹太装束，还有一个老人在踱来踱去，他戴一顶黄帽子，说明他也是犹太人，他的举止显得他正处在无计可施的状况，似乎某种灾难即将降临，以致不断搓着双手。</p> 
<p>对阿特尔斯坦和塞德里克的询问，老犹太人起先没有别的回答，只是接连不断呼叫《旧约全书》中每个族长的名字，祈求他们保佑他，说以实玛利的子孙正举起了剑，要来杀害他们呢。等到从这恐怖中逐渐镇静以后，约克的以撒（因为这确实是我们那位老朋友）终于说明了事实，原来他在阿什贝雇了六个保缥，还有一架驮舆和几匹骡子，因为有一个朋友病了。这些人答应把他们护送到唐卡斯特。一路上平安无事，但到了这里，一个樵夫告诉他们，前面树林中埋伏着一伙强人，这些保嫖马上逃走了，还带走了运驮舆的骡子，害得犹太人父女两个束手无策，进退两难，那伙强盗却随时可能出现，把他们抢劫一空，甚至杀死他们。最后以撒用卑躬屈膝的声音说道；“求求你们这些壮士，让可怜的犹太人与你们一起赶路，保护我们吧，这是从以色列人遭到国虏(注)后，还没有人得到过的恩惠，我凭我们的摩西法典起誓，我一定不会忘记你们的大恩大德。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)指公元前六世纪以色列人亡国后被掳往巴比伦的时期。。</p> 
<p>“你这犹太畜生！”阿特尔斯坦开口便骂，他一向对各种鸡毛蒜皮的小事斤斤计较，尤其是得罪过他的事，他总是怀恨在心，“你忘记在比武场上与我们争夺看台，不把我们放在眼里的事了吗？你们可以抵抗，也可以逃走，随你们的便，或者跟那些强盗合伙做买卖，反正这是你的拿手好戏，可是要我们帮忙，跟我们一起走，你就休想，像你这种人掠夺了整个世界，你们给人掠夺也是活该，我还觉得那些强盗做得对，是主持了公道。”</p> 
<p>塞德里克不赞成他的朋友这种冷酷无情的态度。“我们不妨照顾他们一下，”他说，“分给他们两个仆人，两匹马，把他们送回附近的村庄。这只是稍稍削弱一点我们的力量，但是凭你的宝剑，尊贵的阿特尔斯坦，加上留下的这些人的帮助，我们要对付二十来个毛贼，还是轻而易举的。”</p> 
<p>罗文娜听到强人的袭击，而且就在附近，也有些吃惊，因此竭力附和她的监护人的主张。但就在这时，丽贝卡突然振作精神，一跃而起，从仆人中挤到了撒克逊小姐的马前，跪在地上，按照东方参见贵人的方式，亲吻罗文娜的衣服下摆。然后她站起身来，撩开面纱，以她们两人共同崇敬的上帝的伟大名字，以她们两人共同信仰的西奈山上传授的律法的名义(注)，请求她同情他们，保护他们，允许他们结伴同行。“我请求这样的照顾不是为我自己，”丽贝卡说，“甚至也不是为了那个可怜的老人。我知道，对于基督教徒说来，虐待和损害我们的民族即使算不得功绩，也只是无足轻重的过错；不论在城市，在沙漠，在田野，我们的命运有什么区别呢？但我是为一个许多人所敬重的，甚至也是您所敬重的人请求您，希望在您的保护下，让这个病人得到照料和关心，安全地离开这里。因为如果他遇到不幸，那么您恐怕到了生命的最后一刻，也会为了拒绝我的要求而受到良心的谴责的。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)摩西在西奈山上传授上帝的律法（十诫），见《旧约·出埃及记）第20章。</p> 
<p>丽贝卡提出这呼吁时流露的崇高而庄严的神态，使它对那位撒克逊美女产生了加倍的力量。</p> 
<p>“这人年老体弱，”她对她的监护人说道，“他的闺女年轻美丽，他们的朋友又疾病在身，有生命危险；尽管他们是犹太人，我们作为基督徒，不应对他们见死不救。让我们的人卸下两头骡子，把行李装在两个奴隶后面。骡子可以运载驮舆，我们牵着的两匹马可以让老人和他的女儿骑。”</p> 
<p>塞德里克对她的建议欣然表示同意，阿特尔斯坦也只是附加了一个条件：“他们只能跟在我们全队人马后面，在那里，”他说，“让汪八用他的野猪肉盾牌侍候他们。”</p> 
<p>“那面盾牌早给我丢在比武场上了，”小丑答道，“许多比我本领大的骑士也不得不这么做呢。”</p> 
<p>阿特尔斯坦的脸涨得通红，因为这正是第二天比武大会上他的遭遇。罗文娜听了却正好相反，非常高兴，而且仿佛在为她那位冷漠的追求者的粗鲁嘲笑表示歉意，特地要求丽贝卡把马骑在她的旁边。</p> 
<p>“这恐怕不太合适，”丽贝卡答道，显得既自重又谦逊，“我这么做只能给保护我的小姐带来羞辱。”</p> 
<p>这时行李很快改装好了，因为“强盗”的存在使每个仆人都变得动作敏捷，天色的逐渐变黑也加深了恐怖的感觉。葛四在忙乱中给拖下马背，他趁这机会央求小丑给他松开了缚在手臂上的绳索。汪八把绳子随随便便重缚了一下，也许还是故意的，这样，葛四毫不费力便挣脱了手臂，随即溜进了树丛，神不知鬼不觉地离开了队伍。</p> 
<p>当时一切都乱糟糟的，过了一段时间才有人发现葛四不见了；在下一段路程中，他本应排在一个仆人后面，结果每个仆人都以为别人在看管他，等到他们发现葛四真的逃走，嘁嘁喳喳谈论的时候，队伍已随时可能遭到强盗的袭击，谁也无心过问这事了。</p> 
<p>他们现在经过的那条路非常狭窄，只能勉强容许两匹马并排行走。这时道路开始倾斜，进入深谷，那里有一条溪水穿过，河岸高低不平，又多沼泽，两边长满了矮小的柳树。塞德里克和阿特尔斯坦走在前面，他们看到在这种小径上随时可能挨打，但是谁也没有太多的作战经验，觉得防止危险的唯一办法只是加快速度，尽早通过这个关口。全队人乱哄哄的向前疾走，一部分人刚穿过溪水，突然前后左右同时遭到了攻击，而且来势凶猛；他们处在这种混乱而缺乏准备的状况，一时间无法作出有效的反击。“白龙！白龙！圣乔治保佑快活的英格兰！(注)”的呐喊声从四面八方传来，这是进攻的人冒充撒克逊强盗发出的；现在他们正从周围各处迅速向前推进，因此显得人数很多。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)圣乔治是英国的保护神，圣乔治和白龙便成了古代英国战旗上的图画和战斗口号。</p> 
<p>两个撒克逊头领同时成了俘虏，不过情况不同，表现了他们各自的特点。塞德里克在第一个敌人出现的一刹那，便向他投出了剩下的那支镖枪，而且比投向方斯的那支准确了一些，把那人插到了他身后的一棵株树上。塞德里克得手之后，便跃马冲向第二个人，一边掣出了剑，在愤怒中不及细想，便举剑砍去，以致砍到了头顶的一根粗树枝上，由于用力过猛，剑掉到了地上。他随即成了俘虏，给围在身边的两三个强盗拉下了马。阿特尔斯坦也当了俘虏，他的缰绳给人抓住，在他还没来得及拔出武器，进行任何抵抗以前，他的身子早已给拖到了地上。</p> 
<p>那些仆人既要照看行李，又给主人的遭遇吓得目瞪口呆，一个个只得束手就擒。处在队伍中间的罗文娜小姐，随在队伍后面的犹太父女，也都陷入了同样的不幸。</p> 
<p>整队人中，只有汪八一个逃脱了厄运，在这场合表现得比那些自吹勇敢的人勇敢得多。一个仆人迟疑不决，慢吞吞的刚要拔剑，汪人便把剑夺了过来，像狮子似的挥舞着它，打退了扑向他的几个人，不顾一切地想突人人群，搭救他的主人，但没有成功。发现自己寡不敌众，这小丑只得跳下马背，溜进了树丛，多亏当时一片混乱，逃出了厮杀现场。</p> 
<p>然而勇敢的小丑一旦发现自己安全脱险，不禁迟疑起来，几次想转身回去，与他心爱的主人同甘共苦，一起当俘虏。</p> 
<p>“我听得不少人讲自由的幸福，”他自言自语道，“但我希望有个聪明人能告诉我，现在我得到了自由，该怎么办。”</p> 
<p>他正这么讲，附近有一个声音小心翼翼地喊他了：“汪八！”同时—只狗摇着尾巴，跳到了他身边，他认得这是方斯。于是汪八同样轻轻回答了一声：“葛四！”接着放猪人便出现在他眼前了。</p> 
<p>“这是怎么回事？”葛四焦急地问，“哪来的这些叫喊声和刀剑声？”</p> 
<p>“还不是当今流行的勾当！”汪八说，“他们全给抓走了。”</p> 
<p>“谁给抓走了？”葛四喊道，急得耐不住了。为</p> 
<p>“我的老爷，找的小姐，阿特尔斯坦．亨德们特．还有奥斯瓦尔德。”</p> 
<p>“我的大哪！”葛四说。“他们怎么给抓走的？给谁抓走的？”</p> 
<p>“‘我的主人是动手太快了，”小丑答道，“阿特尔斯坦是动手太慢了，其余的人是根本人想动手。他们现在成了那些穿绿大褂、戴黑面罩的家伙的俘虏，统统给捆住手脚倒在草地上，像你从树上摇下来喂猪的几只酸苹采。我看了真好笑，个过我应该哭才是。”这位正直的小丑真的流下了几滴并非伪装的眼泪。</p> 
<p>葛四的脸色变得激动了。“汪八，”他说，“你有一把剑，你的胆子也一向比你的头脑强大；我们只有两个人，但两个不怕死的人发动的突然袭击，仍可以大有作为，跟我来！”</p> 
<p>“上哪里？什么目的？”小丑问。</p> 
<p>“营救塞德里克。”</p> 
<p>“但你刚才还要跟他一刀两断呢，”汪八说。</p> 
<p>“耶是在他得意的时候，”葛四回答。“跟我来！”</p> 
<p>小丑正想跟他走，第三个人突然出现了，命令两人都站住。根据他的衣着和武器，汪八差点认为这也是刚才袭击他主人的那伙强盗中的一个，但是这人不仅没戴面罩，身上还挂着一根闪闪发亮的丝肩带，肩带下挂着一只贵重的号角，他的声音和神态又显得那么安详和威严，尽管夜色暗淡，小丑还是认出了洛克斯利，那个射箭比赛时，在极其不利的条件下赢得胜利的庄户人。</p> 
<p>“这一切是怎么回事？”他问，“谁在这些森林里抓人，敲榨勒索，绑架过路行人？”</p> 
<p>“你不妨去看看那些人的衣着，”汪八说，“便知道他们是不是你的喽罗了；他们穿得跟你一模一样，都像绿绿的豆荚，分不出彼此呢。”</p> 
<p>“我马上就会调查清楚的，”洛克斯利答道，“现在你们站在这里别动，否则便有生命危险，你们等我回来。听我的话．这对你们和你们的主人都有好处。不过且慢，我得让自己尽可能像那些人。”</p> 
<p>他这么说，解下了挂号角的肩带，从帽上取下了羽毛，把它们交给汪八，然后从腰包内掏出一个面罩，又叮嘱了他们几句，要他们站在原地，便去执行他的侦察任务了。</p> 
<p>“葛四，我们要不要站着不动？”汪八说，“还是趁他不在，赶紧逃走？依我傻瓜之见，他带着强盗的全副装备，随时可以摇身一变成为强盗，不像是个好人。”</p> 
<p>“随他是魔鬼也成，”葛四说，“我们等他回来，不见得便会吃亏。万一他真属于那帮人，他一定已去通风报信，我们逃不了，也打不过他们。再说，我最近的经历让我明白，真的强盗并不是世界上最难对付的坏人。”</p> 
<p>过了几分钟，庄稼人就回来了。</p> 
<p>“葛四朋友，”他说，“我混在那些人中间，了解到他们是什么人派来的，要上哪儿去了。照我看，他们不是真的想害死那些给他们抓住的人。我们现在凭三个人要对付他们，那只是妄想，因为他们都是打惯仗的，而且周围布置了岗哨，任何人都无法靠近他们。但是尽管他们防范严密，我有办法马上召集一支力量，打败他们。你们两个都是仆人，我想，都忠于撒克逊人塞德里克，他是维护英国人的权利的，他遇到危险，不会没有英国人帮助他。所以你们还是跟我来，等我集合人马搭救他。”</p> 
<p>他一边这么说，一边便迈开大步朝树林中直走，小丑和放猪的跟在他后面。但老不讲话，这不符合汪八的个性。</p> 
<p>“我看到这些东西，”他开口了，瞧了瞧仍在他手中的肩带和号角，“就想起了赢得这些漂亮奖品的那一箭，它仿佛还在我的眼前，比圣诞节近得多了。”</p> 
<p>“我也可以起誓，”葛四说道，“那个射箭的好汉的声音，我在白天和黑夜都听到过，算起来那个月夜离现在还不过三天呢。”</p> 
<p>“两位正直的朋友，”庄稼人答道，“我是谁，是干什么的，这与眼前的事毫不相干；等我救出了你们的主人，你们便会明白，我是你们一生中遇到的最好的朋友。至于我用这个名字或那个名字，我射的箭比一个放牛的好或差，我喜欢在阳光下或者月光下活动，这些事都与你们无关，因此你们也大可不必为它们操心。”</p> 
<p>“我们的脑袋伸进了狮子的嘴巴，”汪八凑在葛四耳边说，“得赶快缩回来。”</p> 
<p>“嘘，别作声，”噶四说，“只要你不胡说八道得罪他，我相信我们一定可以平安无事。”</p>
