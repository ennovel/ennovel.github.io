<p>Leaving the Saxon chiefs to return to their banquet as soon as their ungratified curiosity should permit them to attend to the calls of their half-satiated appetite, we have to look in upon the yet more severe imprisonment of Isaac of York. The poor Jew had been hastily thrust into a dungeon-vault of the castle, the floor of which was deep beneath the level of the ground, and very damp, being lower than even the moat itself. The only light was received through one or two loop-holes far above the reach of the captive's hand. These apertures admitted, even at mid-day, only a dim and uncertain light, which was changed for utter darkness long before the rest of the castle had lost the blessing of day. Chains and shackles, which had been the portion of former captives, from whom active exertions to escape had been apprehended, hung rusted and empty on the walls of the prison, and in the rings of one of those sets of fetters there remained two mouldering bones, which seemed to have been once those of the human leg, as if some prisoner had been left not only to perish there, but to be consumed to a skeleton.</p> 
<p>At one end of this ghastly apartment was a large fire-grate, over the top of which were stretched some transverse iron bars, half devoured with rust.</p> 
<p>The whole appearance of the dungeon might have appalled a stouter heart than that of Isaac, who, nevertheless, was more composed under the imminent pressure of danger, than he had seemed to be while affected by terrors, of which the cause was as yet remote and contingent. The lovers of the chase say that the hare feels more agony during the pursuit of the greyhounds, than when she is struggling in their fangs.*</p> 
<p>* "Nota Bene." ---We by no means warrant the accuracy of * this piece of natural history, which we give on the * authority of the Wardour MS. L. T.</p> 
<p>And thus it is probable, that the Jews, by the very frequency of their fear on all occasions, had their minds in some degree prepared for every effort of tyranny which could be practised upon them; so that no aggression, when it had taken place, could bring with it that surprise which is the most disabling quality of terror. Neither was it the first time that Isaac had been placed in circumstances so dangerous. He had therefore experience to guide him, as well as hope, that he might again, as formerly, be delivered as a prey from the fowler. Above all, he had upon his side the unyielding obstinacy of his nation, and that unbending resolution, with which Israelites have been frequently known to submit to the uttermost evils which power and violence can inflict upon them, rather than gratify their oppressors by granting their demands.</p> 
<p>In this humour of passive resistance, and with his garment collected beneath him to keep his limbs from the wet pavement, Isaac sat in a corner of his dungeon, where his folded hands, his dishevelled hair and beard, his furred cloak and high cap, seen by the wiry and broken light, would have afforded a study for Rembrandt, had that celebrated painter existed at the period. The Jew remained, without altering his position, for nearly three hours, at the expiry of which steps were heard on the dungeon stair. The bolts screamed as they were withdrawn---the hinges creaked as the wicket opened, and Reginald Front-de-Boeuf, followed by the two Saracen slaves of the Templar, entered the prison.</p> 
<p>Front-de-Boeuf, a tall and strong man, whose life had been spent in public war or in private feuds and broils, and who had hesitated at no means of extending his feudal power, had features corresponding to his character, and which strongly expressed the fiercer and more malignant passions of the mind. The scars with which his visage was seamed, would, on features of a different cast, have excited the sympathy and veneration due to the marks of honourable valour; but, in the peculiar case of Front-de-Boeuf, they only added to the ferocity of his countenance, and to the dread which his presence inspired. This formidable baron was clad in a leathern doublet, fitted close to his body, which was frayed and soiled with the stains of his armour. He had no weapon, excepting a poniard at his belt, which served to counterbalance the weight of the bunch of rusty keys that hung at his right side.</p> 
<p>The black slaves who attended Front-de-Boeuf were stripped of their gorgeous apparel, and attired in jerkins and trowsers of coarse linen, their sleeves being tucked up above the elbow, like those of butchers when about to exercise their function in the slaughter-house. Each had in his hand a small pannier; and, when they entered the dungeon, they stopt at the door until Front-de-Boeuf himself carefully locked and double-locked it. Having taken this precaution, he advanced slowly up the apartment towards the Jew, upon whom he kept his eye fixed, as if he wished to paralyze him with his glance, as some animals are said to fascinate their prey. It seemed indeed as if the sullen and malignant eye of Front-de-Boeuf possessed some portion of that supposed power over his unfortunate prisoner. The Jew sat with his mouth agape, and his eyes fixed on the savage baron with such earnestness of terror, that his frame seemed literally to shrink together, and to diminish in size while encountering the fierce Norman's fixed and baleful gaze. The unhappy Isaac was deprived not only of the power of rising to make the obeisance which his terror dictated, but he could not even doff his cap, or utter any word of supplication; so strongly was he agitated by the conviction that tortures and death were impending over him.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, the stately form of the Norman appeared to dilate in magnitude, like that of the eagle, which ruffles up its plumage when about to pounce on its defenceless prey. He paused within three steps of the corner in which the unfortunate Jew had now, as it were, coiled himself up into the smallest possible space, and made a sign for one of the slaves to approach. The black satellite came forward accordingly, and, producing from his basket a large pair of scales and several weights, he laid them at the feet of Front-de-Boeuf, and again retired to the respectful distance, at which his companion had already taken his station.</p> 
<p>The motions of these men were slow and solemn, as if there impended over their souls some preconception of horror and of cruelty. Front-de-Boeuf himself opened the scene by thus addressing his ill-fated captive.</p> 
<p>"Most accursed dog of an accursed race," he said, awaking with his deep and sullen voice the sullen echoes of his dungeon vault, "seest thou these scales?"</p> 
<p>The unhappy Jew returned a feeble affirmative.</p> 
<p>"In these very scales shalt thou weigh me out," said the relentless Baron, "a thousand silver pounds, after the just measure and weight of the Tower of London."</p> 
<p>"Holy Abraham!" returned the Jew, finding voice through the very extremity of his danger, "heard man ever such a demand?---Who ever heard, even in a minstrel's tale, of such a sum as a thousand pounds of silver?---What human sight was ever blessed with the vision of such a mass of treasure?---Not within the walls of York, ransack my house and that of all my tribe, wilt thou find the tithe of that huge sum of silver that thou speakest of."</p> 
<p>"I am reasonable," answered Front-de-Boeuf, "and if silver be scant, I refuse not gold. At the rate of a mark of gold for each six pounds of silver, thou shalt free thy unbelieving carcass from such punishment as thy heart has never even conceived."</p> 
<p>"Have mercy on me, noble knight!" exclaimed Isaac; "I am old, and poor, and helpless. It were unworthy to triumph over me---It is a poor deed to crush a worm."</p> 
<p>"Old thou mayst be," replied the knight; "more shame to their folly who have suffered thee to grow grey in usury and knavery ---Feeble thou mayst be, for when had a Jew either heart or hand ---But rich it is well known thou art."</p> 
<p>"I swear to you, noble knight," said the Jew "by all which I believe, and by all which we believe in common------"</p> 
<p>"Perjure not thyself," said the Norman, interrupting him, "and let not thine obstinacy seal thy doom, until thou hast seen and well considered the fate that awaits thee. Think not I speak to thee only to excite thy terror, and practise on the base cowardice thou hast derived from thy tribe. I swear to thee by that which thou dost NOT believe, by the gospel which our church teaches, and by the keys which are given her to bind and to loose, that my purpose is deep and peremptory. This dungeon is no place for trifling. Prisoners ten thousand times more distinguished than thou have died within these walls, and their fate hath never been known! But for thee is reserved a long and lingering death, to which theirs were luxury."</p> 
<p>He again made a signal for the slaves to approach, and spoke to them apart, in their own language; for he also had been in Palestine, where perhaps, he had learnt his lesson of cruelty. The Saracens produced from their baskets a quantity of charcoal, a pair of bellows, and a flask of oil. While the one struck a light with a flint and steel, the other disposed the charcoal in the large rusty grate which we have already mentioned, and exercised the bellows until the fuel came to a red glow.</p> 
<p>"Seest thou, Isaac," said Front-de-Boeuf, "the range of iron bars above the glowing charcoal?*---</p> 
<p>* Note E. The range of iron bars above that glowing charcoal</p> 
<p>on that warm couch thou shalt lie, stripped of thy clothes as if thou wert to rest on a bed of down. One of these slaves shall maintain the fire beneath thee, while the other shall anoint thy wretched limbs with oil, lest the roast should burn.---Now, choose betwixt such a scorching bed and the payment of a thousand pounds of silver; for, by the head of my father, thou hast no other option."</p> 
<p>"It is impossible," exclaimed the miserable Jew---"it is impossible that your purpose can be real! The good God of nature never made a heart capable of exercising such cruelty!"</p> 
<p>"Trust not to that, Isaac," said Front-de-Boeuf, "it were a fatal error. Dost thou think that I, who have seen a town sacked, in which thousands of my Christian countrymen perished by sword, by flood, and by fire, will blench from my purpose for the outcries or screams of one single wretched Jew?---or thinkest thou that these swarthy slaves, who have neither law, country, nor conscience, but their master's will---who use the poison, or the stake, or the poniard, or the cord, at his slightest wink ---thinkest thou that THEY will have mercy, who do not even understand the language in which it is asked?---Be wise, old man; discharge thyself of a portion of thy superfluous wealth; repay to the hands of a Christian a part of what thou hast acquired by the usury thou hast practised on those of his religion. Thy cunning may soon swell out once more thy shrivelled purse, but neither leech nor medicine can restore thy scorched hide and flesh wert thou once stretched on these bars. Tell down thy ransom, I say, and rejoice that at such rate thou canst redeem thee from a dungeon, the secrets of which few have returned to tell. I waste no more words with thee---choose between thy dross and thy flesh and blood, and as thou choosest, so shall it be."</p> 
<p>"So may Abraham, Jacob, and all the fathers of our people assist me," said Isaac, "I cannot make the choice, because I have not the means of satisfying your exorbitant demand!"</p> 
<p>"Seize him and strip him, slaves," said the knight, "and let the fathers of his race assist him if they can."</p> 
<p>The assistants, taking their directions more from the Baron's eye and his hand than his tongue, once more stepped forward, laid hands on the unfortunate Isaac, plucked him up from the ground, and, holding him between them, waited the hard-hearted Baron's farther signal. The unhappy Jew eyed their countenances and that of Front-de-Boeuf, in hope of discovering some symptoms of relenting; but that of the Baron exhibited the same cold, half-sullen, half-sarcastic smile which had been the prelude to his cruelty; and the savage eyes of the Saracens, rolling gloomily under their dark brows, acquiring a yet more sinister expression by the whiteness of the circle which surrounds the pupil, evinced rather the secret pleasure which they expected from the approaching scene, than any reluctance to be its directors or agents. The Jew then looked at the glowing furnace, over which he was presently to be stretched, and seeing no chance of his tormentor's relenting, his resolution gave way.</p> 
<p>"I will pay," he said, "the thousand pounds of silver---That is," he added, after a moment's pause, "I will pay it with the help of my brethren; for I must beg as a mendicant at the door of our synagogue ere I make up so unheard-of a sum.---When and where must it be delivered?"</p> 
<p>"Here," replied Front-de-Boeuf, "here it must be delivered ---weighed it must be---weighed and told down on this very dungeon floor.---Thinkest thou I will part with thee until thy ransom is secure?"</p> 
<p>"And what is to be my surety," said the Jew, "that I shall be at liberty after this ransom is paid?"</p> 
<p>"The word of a Norman noble, thou pawn-broking slave," answered Front-de-Boeuf; "the faith of a Norman nobleman, more pure than the gold and silver of thee and all thy tribe."</p> 
<p>"I crave pardon, noble lord," said Isaac timidly, "but wherefore should I rely wholly on the word of one who will trust nothing to mine?"</p> 
<p>"Because thou canst not help it, Jew," said the knight, sternly. "Wert thou now in thy treasure-chamber at York, and were I craving a loan of thy shekels, it would be thine to dictate the time of payment, and the pledge of security. This is MY treasure-chamber. Here I have thee at advantage, nor will I again deign to repeat the terms on which I grant thee liberty."</p> 
<p>The Jew groaned deeply.---"Grant me," he said, "at least with my own liberty, that of the companions with whom I travel. They scorned me as a Jew, yet they pitied my desolation, and because they tarried to aid me by the way, a share of my evil hath come upon them; moreover, they may contribute in some sort to my ransom."</p> 
<p>"If thou meanest yonder Saxon churls," said Front-de-Boeuf, "their ransom will depend upon other terms than thine. Mind thine own concerns, Jew, I warn thee, and meddle not with those of others."</p> 
<p>"I am, then," said Isaac, "only to be set at liberty, together with mine wounded friend?"</p> 
<p>"Shall I twice recommend it," said Front-de-Boeuf, "to a son of Israel, to meddle with his own concerns, and leave those of others alone?---Since thou hast made thy choice, it remains but that thou payest down thy ransom, and that at a short day."</p> 
<p>"Yet hear me," said the Jew---"for the sake of that very wealth which thou wouldst obtain at the expense of thy------" Here he stopt short, afraid of irritating the savage Norman. But Front-de-Boeuf only laughed, and himself filled up the blank at which the Jew had hesitated.</p> 
<p>"At the expense of my conscience, thou wouldst say, Isaac; speak it out---I tell thee, I am reasonable. I can bear the reproaches of a loser, even when that loser is a Jew. Thou wert not so patient, Isaac, when thou didst invoke justice against Jacques Fitzdotterel, for calling thee a usurious blood-sucker, when thy exactions had devoured his patrimony."</p> 
<p>"I swear by the Talmud," said the Jew, "that your valour has been misled in that matter. Fitzdotterel drew his poniard upon me in mine own chamber, because I craved him for mine own silver. The term of payment was due at the Passover."</p> 
<p>"I care not what he did," said Front-de-Boeuf; "the question is, when shall I have mine own?---when shall I have the shekels, Isaac?"</p> 
<p>"Let my daughter Rebecca go forth to York," answered Isaac, "with your safe conduct, noble knight, and so soon as man and horse can return, the treasure------" Here he groaned deeply, but added, after the pause of a few seconds,---"The treasure shall be told down on this very floor."</p> 
<p>"Thy daughter!" said Front-de-Boeuf, as if surprised,---"By heavens, Isaac, I would I had known of this. I deemed that yonder black-browed girl had been thy concubine, and I gave her to be a handmaiden to Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, after the fashion of patriarchs and heroes of the days of old, who set us in these matters a wholesome example."</p> 
<p>The yell which Isaac raised at this unfeeling communication made the very vault to ring, and astounded the two Saracens so much that they let go their hold of the Jew. He availed himself of his enlargement to throw himself on the pavement, and clasp the knees of Front-de-Boeuf.</p> 
<p>"Take all that you have asked," said he, "Sir Knight---take ten times more---reduce me to ruin and to beggary, if thou wilt, ---nay, pierce me with thy poniard, broil me on that furnace, but spare my daughter, deliver her in safety and honour!---As thou art born of woman, spare the honour of a helpless maiden---She is the image of my deceased Rachel, she is the last of six pledges of her love---Will you deprive a widowed husband of his sole remaining comfort?---Will you reduce a father to wish that his only living child were laid beside her dead mother, in the tomb of our fathers?"</p> 
<p>"I would," said the Norman, somewhat relenting, "that I had known of this before. I thought your race had loved nothing save their moneybags."</p> 
<p>"Think not so vilely of us, Jews though we be," said Isaac, eager to improve the moment of apparent sympathy; "the hunted fox, the tortured wildcat loves its young---the despised and persecuted race of Abraham love their children!"</p> 
<p>"Be it so," said Front-de-Boeuf; "I will believe it in future, Isaac, for thy very sake---but it aids us not now, I cannot help what has happened, or what is to follow; my word is passed to my comrade in arms, nor would I break it for ten Jews and Jewesses to boot. Besides, why shouldst thou think evil is to come to the girl, even if she became Bois-Guilbert's booty?"</p> 
<p>"There will, there must!" exclaimed Isaac, wringing his hands in agony; "when did Templars breathe aught but cruelty to men, and dishonour to women!"</p> 
<p>"Dog of an infidel," said Front-de-Boeuf, with sparkling eyes, and not sorry, perhaps, to seize a pretext for working himself into a passion, "blaspheme not the Holy Order of the Temple of Zion, but take thought instead to pay me the ransom thou hast promised, or woe betide thy Jewish throat!"</p> 
<p>"Robber and villain!" said the Jew, retorting the insults of his oppressor with passion, which, however impotent, he now found it impossible to bridle, "I will pay thee nothing---not one silver penny will I pay thee, unless my daughter is delivered to me in safety and honour!"</p> 
<p>"Art thou in thy senses, Israelite?" said the Norman, sternly ---"has thy flesh and blood a charm against heated iron and scalding oil?"</p> 
<p>"I care not!" said the Jew, rendered desperate by paternal affection; "do thy worst. My daughter is my flesh and blood, dearer to me a thousand times than those limbs which thy cruelty threatens. No silver will I give thee, unless I were to pour it molten down thy avaricious throat---no, not a silver penny will I give thee, Nazarene, were it to save thee from the deep damnation thy whole life has merited! Take my life if thou wilt, and say, the Jew, amidst his tortures, knew how to disappoint the Christian."</p> 
<p>"We shall see that," said Front-de-Boeuf; "for by the blessed rood, which is the abomination of thy accursed tribe, thou shalt feel the extremities of fire and steel!---Strip him, slaves, and chain him down upon the bars."</p> 
<p>In spite of the feeble struggles of the old man, the Saracens had already torn from him his upper garment, and were proceeding totally to disrobe him, when the sound of a bugle, twice winded without the castle, penetrated even to the recesses of the dungeon, and immediately after loud voices were heard calling for Sir Reginald Front-de-Boeuf. Unwilling to be found engaged in his hellish occupation, the savage Baron gave the slaves a signal to restore Isaac's garment, and, quitting the dungeon with his attendants, he left the Jew to thank God for his own deliverance, or to lament over his daughter's captivity, and probable fate, as his personal or parental feelings might prove strongest.</p>

<p>(注)莎士比亚的喜剧，引文见第二幕第八场。</p> 
<p>两位撒克逊家长只能怀着得不到满足的好奇心，依然回到餐桌边，继续满足他们半饱的食欲；我们也只得暂时丢开他们，来到更可怕的牢房里，看看约克的以撒的情形吧。这个可怜的犹太人给匆匆关进了城堡内的一间土牢，它位在地面以下，甚至比周围的壕沟更低，非常潮湿。光线只能从一两个狭长的洞口透入，它们又比俘虏举起手来还高得多。哪怕在中午，穿过这些洞口的光线也昏昏沉沉，上分暗淡，同此城堡的其他屋子还沐浴在幸福的日光中时，这里早已变得黑啾啾的。铁链和镣铐挂在墙上，已经生锈，这是从前的囚犯留下的东西．是为了防止他们越狱潜逃用的；一副脚镣上还挂着两根霉烂的骨头，看来是人的人腿上的，似乎有个囚徒不仅死在那里，还在那里腐烂，最后剩了几根白骨。</p> 
<p>在这间阴森的屋子的一头，有一个大火炉，炉顶横放着几根大铁条，它们也一半生锈了。</p> 
<p>地牢的整个外表，哪怕比以撒坚强的人看了，也会毛骨惊然，然而面对即将来临的危险，他反而比较镇静了，不像危险还遥远，仅仅可能发生的时候那么惊恐万状。爱好打猎的人说，兔子在给猎狗追逐的时候感到的痛苦，比它们在它的牙齿中挣扎的时候更大。(注)那些犹太人也许正因为恐怖随时随地威胁着他们，在心理上对一切可能落到他们身上的暴力，已在一定程度上有所准备，这样，侵害一旦真的降临，他们反倒不致惊慌失措，而惊慌正是使恐怖变得难以忍受的最大因素。对以撒说来，陷入这种危险的境地已不是第一次；他有应付这类困境的经验，也不会丧失希望，他相信他还能像以前一样逢凶化吉，不致成为暴徒的俎上肉。何况从他而言，他具有他的民族坚定顽强的精神，大家知道，以色列人曾经凭他们不屈不挠的意志，应付过暴力和压迫可能给予他们的各种骇人听闻的灾难，而不是俯首听命，满足压迫者的一切需索。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)请注意，这说法来自《沃杜尔文稿》，我们不能保证它符合自然界的真实情况。——原注</p> 
<p>怀着那种消极抵抗的心情，以撒把衣服铺在身子下面，防止地面的潮气危害他的四肢，坐在上牢的一角；他合抱着双手，穿着皮毛衣服，戴着高顶帽子，头发和胡须都乱蓬蓬的，这副样子在一缕缕细长分散的光线映照下，已完全符合伦勃朗(注)的构思，要是那位著名画家活在那个时期的话。在将近三个小时中，犹太人几乎没有改变过姿势，但接着。地牢的楼梯上响起了脚步声，门闩随即被咯吱咯吱地拉开，铰链嘎嘎直响，牢狱的小门打开了，牛面将军雷金纳德走进了地牢，后面跟着圣殿骑士的两名萨拉森奴隶。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)伦勃朗（1606—1669），荷兰的伟大画家，善于运用强烈的色彩，鲜明的对比表现人物性格。</p> 
<p>牛面将军生得高大强壮，他的一生除了在战场上厮杀，便是与人争权夺利，为了扩大封建权力，他可以不择手段；他的面貌与他的性格完全一致，充分表现了他更为凶恶、更为残暴的内心。他脸上留下了几条刀疤，这在另一种形态的脸上，也许可以作为光荣负伤的标志，引起同情和尊敬；但是在牛面将军这张特殊的相貌上，它们只能使他的脸变得更加狰狞可怕，使他这个人更显得残忍狠毒。这个骇人的高贵领主，穿着一件已给铠甲磨损和玷污的紧身皮上衣。他没有拿武器，只在腰带里插着一把匕首，它正好与右边挂的一大串沉甸甸的生锈的钥匙，起了平衡作用。</p> 
<p>跟随牛面将军的两个黑奴已脱下华丽的外衣，穿上了粗麻布短袄和裤子，他们的衣袖卷到了胳膊肘上，跟屠夫似的，仿佛作好了在屠宰场上行使职责的准备。他们每人手里提着一只小篓子，一走进地牢，便站在门口，等牛面将军亲自用两道锁把门小心锁上。完成这戒备措施后，他才慢慢走进屋子，来到犹太人面前．把眼睛盯住了他，仿佛想用目光吓倒他，据说，有些动物便是用这办法捕捉食物的。确实，牛面将军发出的阴森、凶恶的目光，对不幸的俘虏产个了一部分那样的作用。犹太人瘫在地上，张开了嘴，一眼不眨地望着那个野蛮的领主，脸色又紧张义害怕，整个身子一动不动，似乎在残忍成性的诺曼人两只邪恶的眼睛的逼视下，真的蜷缩变小氏不幸的以撒不仅失去了站直身子的能力，没法按照恐怖叮嘱他的那样，向他弯腰行礼，而且不能脱下帽于，说出任何哀求的话；他只觉得心慌意乱，相信酷刑和死亡即将临到他的身上。</p> 
<p>相反，诺曼人的魁梧身材却好像在逐渐膨胀、扩大，像老鹰准备扑向没有自卫能力的猎物似的，把全身的羽毛都竖了起来。这时，不幸的犹太人在墙角缩成一团，可以说已达到了最小限度；诺曼人在离他三步远的地方站住了，向一个奴隶做了个手势，要他上前。那个黑皮肤的走狗立即来到前面，从篓子里取出了一个大天平和几块砝码，把它们放在牛面将军脚边，然后退到一定距离以外，与已经站在那里的他的伙伴并排立着。</p> 
<p>两个仆人的行动缓慢而严肃，仿佛他们心中已预感到恐怖而残忍的一幕即将开始。牛面将军为这一幕所作的汗场白，是向不幸的俘虏发出的。</p> 
<p>“你，罪恶的民族中一只罪恶累累的狗，”他说，低沉而阴森的嗓音在地牢的拱顶下发出了不祥的回声，“看到这只天平没有？”</p> 
<p>愁眉苦脸的犹太人有气无力地答了个“是”字。</p> 
<p>“你得按照伦敦塔(注)公正的度量衡标准，”无情的诺曼人说道，“用这架天平称给我一千磅银子。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)伦敦的王室要塞，从前王家造币厂设在要塞内。</p> 
<p>“神圣的亚伯拉罕啊！”犹太人答道，终于在危急关头发出了声音，“准听到过这样的要求呀？一千磅银于这么大的数目，哪怕在说唱诗人的故事中，有人听到过吗？又有谁的眼睛这么福气，见到过这么一大堆财富？在约克的城墙内，哪怕搜追我的和我每个族人的家，你也找不出你说的那个数目十分之一的银子。”</p> 
<p>“我是讲道理的，”牛面将军答道，“如果银子不够，可以用金子抵数。一马克黄金抵六磅向银。这样，你这只不信基督的狗就可以免受皮肉之苦了；要知道，这种刑罚是你连想象也想象不到的。”</p> 
<p>“饶了我吧，尊贵的骑士！”以撒喊道，“我又老又穷，孤苦零丁。跟我生气是不值得的。掐死我就像掐死一只虫子，不必花那么多力气。”</p> 
<p>“也许你是老了，”骑土答道；“这得怪那些人纵容了你，让你靠高利盘剥和讹诈欺骗活到了这么大的年纪。也许你是身体虚弱，因为哪个犹太人有强壮的体格，充沛的精力呢？不过你钱是有的，这大家知道。”</p> 
<p>“我向您起誓，尊贵的骑上，”犹太人说，“凭我所信仰的一切起誓，凭我们共同信仰的……”</p> 
<p>“不要发假誓，”诺曼人说，打断了他的话，“不要让你的固执害了你的性命，还是趁早想想，什么样的命运在等待着你吧。不要以为我对你讲的话只是吓唬你的，只是要利用你的种族赋予你的卑鄙懦弱的特点，引起你的恐惧。我凭你所不相信的神，凭我们的教会教导我们的福音，凭上帝给予它的捆绑和释放的钥匙起誓。” (注)我的意志是坚定的，不可动摇的。这个地牢也不是跟你闹着玩的。比你显赫千万倍的囚徒曾死在这些墙壁内，他们的下场从没有人知道！只是他们的命运比你好．我为你保留着慢慢折腾、逐渐咽气的特殊待遇。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)《新约·马太福音》第16章耶稣对他的门徒说：“我要把我的教会建造在这磐石上，……把天国的钥匙给你,凡你在地上所捆绑的，在大上也要捆绑，凡你在地下所释放的，在天上也要释放。”</p> 
<p>他又做了个手势，让两个奴隶走到前面，用他们的语言轻轻交代了他们几句，因为他也到过巴勒斯坦，他的心也许还是在那里变得这么残酷的。萨拉森人从他们的婆子里取出了大量木炭、一只风箱和一罐油＿一个人用燧石和大刀打火，另一个人把木炭倒在我们提到过的那只生锈的大炉子里，然后拉动风箱，把火烧得红红的。</p> 
<p>“以撒，”牛面将军说，“你看见烧红的炉子上的这排铁条没有？(注)我们要剥掉你的衣服，让你像躺在鸭绒褥子上一样，躺在这只温暖的床上＿一个奴隶拉风箱，让你下面的火烧得旺旺的，另一个在你倒霉的手脚上搽油，免得它们给烤焦。现在，你可以在烤床和一千磅银子之间进行选择。凭我父亲的名义起誓，你没有别的路可走。”</p>

<p>(注)见作者附注四．一原注</p> 
<p>“这不可能，”伤心的犹太人嚷道，“你的话不可能是真的！慈祥的上帝个会创造一颗这么冷酷的心！”</p> 
<p>“别那么自信，以撒，”牛面将军说，“这个错误会送掉你的命。我看见过一个城市怎么遭到洗劫，我们千百个基督徒同胞怎么死在刀枪下、死在洪水中，死在烈火中，你以为像我这样的人，听到一个堕落的犹太人的几声呼喊和号叫、我的决心便会动摇吗？这些黑奴不知道法律，不知道国家和良心，只知道他们的主人的命令，只要主人眨一眨眼睛，他们便会用毒药．用炮烙刑，用匕首，用绳子把你处死，你以为这些甚至不懂得你的语言的人．会时你的哀求产生一点怜悯心吗？放聪明一些，老头子，把你多余的财产拿出一部分来，把你靠高利贷从基督往那里榨取到的财产，还给他们一部分。你的狡猾马上可以使你的钱包重新装得鼓鼓的，可是你的身体一旦躺到那些铁条上，没有一个医生或音一种药品，可以使你烤焦的皮肉恢复原状。听我的话，乖乖地付你的赎金吧，你应该感到高兴．能够从这个地牢中跑出去；要知道，很少有人能活着从这里出去，泄露这儿的秘密的。我不想再跟你浪费唇舌，在你的钱袋和你的皮肉之间作出选择吧，你选择什么就会得到什么。”</p> 
<p>“亚伯拉罕、雅各和我们民族的一切始祖帮助我吧，”以撒说，“我无法作出选择，因为我没有力量满足你的苛刻要求！”</p> 
<p>“抓住他力呼他的衣服，奴才们．”骑士说，“他的祖先也许可以救他，那么让他们帮助他吧。”</p> 
<p>两个帮手主要是从主人的眼色和手势，而不是从他的语言接受指示的，现在重义走到前面，抓住不幸的以撤，把他从地上提了起来，挟在他们中间，等待冷酷的主人的进一步指示。不幸的犹太人望望他们的脸色，又望望牛面将军，希望从他脸上看到，一点怜悯的迹象，但他看到的依然是又像讥讽又像生气的冷笑，与他刚才发表开场内的时候一样。两个萨拉森人瞪出了野蛮的眼睛，眼球在乌黑的眉毛下阴沉地转动着，瞳孔周围的那道白圈把它们衬托得更加森严可怕，它们流露的只是对即将来临的惨剧暗暗得意的心情，不是对担当它的主持人或执行人的反感。然后犹太人又望望烧红的炉火，眼看他就要给放在那上面了，可是根本看不出那个折磨他的人有丝毫宽容的表现；于是他的决心动摇了。</p> 
<p>“我愿意付钱，”他说，“付一干磅银子。不过，”他停了了一会．义道．“这得靠我们同族人的帮助；我必须守在犹太会堂门门，像讨饭一样向他们乞求，才能凑集这么一笔闻所未闻的大款子。在什么时候，什么地方交钱？”</p> 
<p>“在这儿，”牛面将军答道，“必须在这儿交付；先得称一下；称过以后，便堆在这儿地上。你以为我拿到赎金以前，就会放你走吗？”</p> 
<p>“那么怎样保证我付清赎金以后，便能获得自由？”犹太人问。</p> 
<p>“一个诺曼贵族的话便是保证，你这个高利盘剥的守财奴，”牛面将军答道，“一个诺曼贵人的信用，比你和你的同族人的全部金银更可靠。”</p> 
<p>“请原谅，尊贵的老爷，”以撒怯生生地说，“但是一个对我丝毫也不信任的人，我为什么要完全相信他的话呢？”</p> 
<p>“因为你不得不相信，犹太佬，”骑士说，态度很严厉。“如果你现在是在约克城你的库房里，我来向你借钱，那么我只能按照你定的还款日期和担保办理。这里是我的库房。在这里你得听我的。我定的释放你的条件，你已经知道，不必我再重复一遍了。”</p> 
<p>犹太人深深叹了口气。“至少你得答应我，”他说，“在释放我的同时，也释放那些与我一起旅行的朋友。他们瞧不起我们犹太人，然而他们同情我的困苦遭遇，为了顺便帮助我们，宁可耽误了赶路，现在我的灾难却落到了他们头卜；再说，他们可能帮助我解决一部分赎金。”</p> 
<p>“如果你是指那些撒克逊乡下佬，”牛面将军说，“他们也得付赎金，与你是两码事。我警告你，犹太佬，你还是管你自己吧，别人的事用不到你操心。”</p> 
<p>“那么，”以撒说，“只有那位受伤的朋友，才能与我一起释放啦？”</p> 
<p>“你还要我讲两遍不成？”牛面将军说，“一个以色列人只能管他自己，别人的事不必他管。你既然作了选择，你要考虑的只是如何付你的赎金，而n得在一两天内付清。”</p> 
<p>“然而听我说，”犹太人又道，“你为了得到那些钱，不惜违背你的……”他突然住口了．怕他的话会触怒那个野蛮的诺曼人。但是牛面将军只是大笑一声，把犹太人不敢讲的话替他说了出来：“不惜违背我的良心，你是想这么说吧，以撒？你尽管说好了，我告诉你，我是讲道理的；一个吃了亏的人，哪怕他是犹太人，骂我几句是难免的，我不在乎。你却不像我这么宽宏大量，以撒，雅克·菲茨多特莱尔因为你侵吞他的家产，骂了你一声吸血充，你便向法院控告他呢。”</p> 
<p>“我凭《塔木德》(注1)起誓，”犹太人说，“你老在那件事上弄错了。菲茨多特莱尔是欠了我的钱不还，又在我的屋里拔出匕首威胁我，我才那么做的。他欠我的债早在逾越节(注2)就到期了。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注1)《塔木德》，犹太教的主要经典之一，其重要性仅次于《旧约全书》。</p> 
<p>(注2)逾越节，犹太教的主要节日之一。</p> 
<p>“我不管他的事，”牛面将军说，“现在问题是，我的钱什么时候可以拿到？以撒，你什么时候付钱？”</p> 
<p>“让我的女儿丽贝卡前往约克城，”以撒答道，一你派个人护送她，尊贵的骑士，等他们骑了马赶回来，银子……”他长叹一声，停了一下，又赶紧往下讲，“银子就可以在这间屋子里交割了。”</p> 
<p>“你的女儿！”牛面将军说，仿佛吃了一惊，“我的老天爷，以撒，要是我早知道这点就好了。我还以为那个黑眉毛姑娘是你的小妾呢，我把她给布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔骑士当使女了；这是按照从前家主和勇士的老规矩办理，在这方面他们给我们提供了很好的榜样。”</p> 
<p>以撒听到这个无情的消息，大喊一声，声音震天动地，在上牢中嗡嗡回旋，把两个萨拉森人吓了一跳，松开了抓住犹太人的手。他利用这松手的机会，扑到地上，抱住了牛面将军的膝盖。</p> 
<p>“把你要的一切都拿去吧，骑士老爷，”他说， “哪怕比这多十倍，哪怕让我倾家荡产也可以……不，用你的匕首把我刺死，把我去进那只炉子都可以，但是饶了我的女儿吧，让她清清白白地恢复自由。你也是女人生的，不要糟蹋一个无依无靠的女子吧。她是我去世的拉雪儿的影子，她的六个子女只剩下这一个了。你忍心剥夺我这个鳏夫的唯一安慰吗？你要逼得一个父亲宁可失去他唯一活着的孩子，让她埋到我们祖先的坟墓中，与她死去的母亲待在一起吗？”</p> 
<p>“要是我早知道这点，我是会救她的，”诺曼人说，似乎有些后悔了。“我还以为你们这个民族除了钱袋，什么也不爱呢。”</p> 
<p>“不要把我们想得这么坏，尽管我们是犹太人，”以撒说，竭力想趁这机会，争取他的同情，“遭到追捕的狐狸，遭到围攻的野猫，尚且要保护它们的孩子，被侮辱和被损害的亚伯拉罕的后人，自然也爱他们的子女！”</p> 
<p>“但愿如此，”牛面将军说，“都亏了你，以撒，以后我会相信这点。但目前无法可想了；我不能改变已经发生的事，或者它所带来的后果，我答应过我的骑士朋友了，哪怕有十个犹太人，加上十个犹太姑娘，我也不能为了他们不守信用。再说，就算这姑娘落进了布瓦吉贝尔手中，你干吗认为这对她的前途不利呢?”</p> 
<p>“当然这样．这是一定的！”以撒喊道，痛苦地绞着双手，“那些圣殿骑士除了欺压男人，糟蹋女人，还会干什么别的事！”</p> 
<p>“你这只不信基督的狗！”牛面将军喝道，眼睛炯炯发亮，也许他巴不得找到这个借口，可以重新燃起他的怒火，“不准你诬蔑耶路撒冷圣殿的神圣字军革，还是想想你答应付的赎金吧，否则你的性命就难保了！”</p> 
<p>“强盗，无赖！”犹太人说，再也忍受不住压迫着的侮辱了，因为尽管他天性懦弱．这时已无法克制他的感情。“我现在什么也不付给你，一个铜子也不给你．除非你先把我的女儿还给我，清清白白地还给我！”</p> 
<p>“你疯了不成，以色列人？”诺曼骑士铁板着脸说。“难道你以为你的血肉是有魔法的，抵挡得了烧红的铁条和滚烫的熟油？”</p> 
<p>“我不怕！”犹太人说，父女之情使他忘记了一切，“随你怎么办吧。我的女儿便是我的血和肉，她对我比我的身体贵重一千倍，你的残酷手段只能威胁我的身体，不能使我放弃她。我一磅银子也不给你、除非把它熔化后，灌进你贪婪的喉咙。不，一小块银子也不给你，拿撒勒人，哪怕这一小块银子便能把你从你一生罪有应得的、万劫不复的地狱中拯救出来，我也不给！你要我的命，你就拿去吧，要知道，哪怕在严刑拷打下，犹太人也不会让基督徒如愿以偿。”</p> 
<p>“那就等着瞧吧，”牛面将军说。“你们这个该死的民族本来罪恶滔天，曾把基督打死在十字架上，你们理应受到火和铁的惩罚！扒下他的衣服，小子们，把他绑在铁条上。”</p> 
<p>两个萨拉森人不顾老人的无力反抗，剥去了他的上衣，正准备进一步剥掉他的全部衣服时，城堡外面响起了三通号角声，它甚至也传进了偏远的地牢中，接着又听到了呐喊声，它指名要牛面将军雷金纳德答话。野蛮的诺曼贵族不愿让人看到，他在干这种地狱的勾当，向两个奴隶做了个手势，要他们给犹太人重新穿上衣服，然后带着他们走出了地牢．于是犹太人独自留在那里，为自己的得救感谢上帝，或者为女儿的被俘和可能遭遇的命运伤心，至于究竟如何，这得看在他心中，是他自身的安全还是他对女儿的感情占第一位了。</p>
