Old Song</p> 
<p>When the Jester, arrayed in the cowl and frock of the hermit, and having his knotted cord twisted round his middle, stood before the portal of the castle of Front-de-Boeuf, the warder demanded of him his name and errand.</p> 
<p>"Pax vobiscum," answered the Jester, "I am a poor brother of the Order of St Francis, who come hither to do my office to certain unhappy prisoners now secured within this castle."</p> 
<p>"Thou art a bold friar," said the warder, "to come hither, where, saving our own drunken confessor, a cock of thy feather hath not crowed these twenty years."</p> 
<p>"Yet I pray thee, do mine errand to the lord of the castle," answered the pretended friar; "trust me it will find good acceptance with him, and the cock shall crow, that the whole castle shall hear him."</p> 
<p>"Gramercy," said the warder; "but if I come to shame for leaving my post upon thine errand, I will try whether a friar's grey gown be proof against a grey-goose shaft."</p> 
<p>With this threat he left his turret, and carried to the hall of the castle his unwonted intelligence, that a holy friar stood before the gate and demanded instant admission. With no small wonder he received his master's commands to admit the holy man immediately; and, having previously manned the entrance to guard against surprise, he obeyed, without further scruple, the commands which he had received. The harebrained self-conceit which had emboldened Wamba to undertake this dangerous office, was scarce sufficient to support him when he found himself in the presence of a man so dreadful, and so much dreaded, as Reginald Front-de-Boeuf, and he brought out his "pax vobiscum", to which he, in a good measure, trusted for supporting his character, with more anxiety and hesitation than had hitherto accompanied it. But Front-de-Boeuf was accustomed to see men of all ranks tremble in his presence, so that the timidity of the supposed father did not give him any cause of suspicion.</p> 
<p>"Who and whence art thou, priest?" said he.</p> 
<p>"'Pax vobiscum'," reiterated the Jester, "I am a poor servant of St Francis, who, travelling through this wilderness, have fallen among thieves, (as Scripture hath it,) 'quidam viator incidit in latrones', which thieves have sent me unto this castle in order to do my ghostly office on two persons condemned by your honourable justice."</p> 
<p>"Ay, right," answered Front-de-Boeuf; "and canst thou tell me, holy father, the number of those banditti?"</p> 
<p>"Gallant sir," answered the Jester, "'nomen illis legio', their name is legion."</p> 
<p>"Tell me in plain terms what numbers there are, or, priest, thy cloak and cord will ill protect thee."</p> 
<p>"Alas!" said the supposed friar, "'cor meum eructavit', that is to say, I was like to burst with fear! but I conceive they may be ---what of yeomen ---what of commons, at least five hundred men."</p> 
<p>"What!" said the Templar, who came into the hall that moment, "muster the wasps so thick here? it is time to stifle such a mischievous brood." Then taking Front-de-Boeuf aside "Knowest thou the priest?"</p> 
<p>"He is a stranger from a distant convent," said Front-de-Boeuf; "I know him not."</p> 
<p>"Then trust him not with thy purpose in words," answered the Templar. "Let him carry a written order to De Bracy's company of Free Companions, to repair instantly to their master's aid. In the meantime, and that the shaveling may suspect nothing, permit him to go freely about his task of preparing these Saxon hogs for the slaughter-house."</p> 
<p>"It shall be so," said Front-de-Boeuf. And he forthwith appointed a domestic to conduct Wamba to the apartment where Cedric and Athelstane were confined.</p> 
<p>The impatience of Cedric had been rather enhanced than diminished by his confinement. He walked from one end of the hall to the other, with the attitude of one who advances to charge an enemy, or to storm the breach of a beleaguered place, sometimes ejaculating to himself, sometimes addressing Athelstane, who stoutly and stoically awaited the issue of the adventure, digesting, in the meantime, with great composure, the liberal meal which he had made at noon, and not greatly interesting himself about the duration of his captivity, which he concluded, would, like all earthly evils, find an end in Heaven's good time.</p> 
<p>"'Pax vobiscum'," said the Jester, entering the apartment; "the blessing of St Dunstan, St Dennis, St Duthoc, and all other saints whatsoever, be upon ye and about ye."</p> 
<p>"Enter freely," answered Cedric to the supposed friar; "with what intent art thou come hither?"</p> 
<p>"To bid you prepare yourselves for death," answered the Jester.</p> 
<p>"It is impossible!" replied Cedric, starting. "Fearless and wicked as they are, they dare not attempt such open and gratuitous cruelty!"</p> 
<p>"Alas!" said the Jester, "to restrain them by their sense of humanity, is the same as to stop a runaway horse with a bridle of silk thread. Bethink thee, therefore, noble Cedric, and you also, gallant Athelstane, what crimes you have committed in the flesh; for this very day will ye be called to answer at a higher tribunal."</p> 
<p>"Hearest thou this, Athelstane?" said Cedric; "we must rouse up our hearts to this last action, since better it is we should die like men, than live like slaves."</p> 
<p>"I am ready," answered Athelstane, "to stand the worst of their malice, and shall walk to my death with as much composure as ever I did to my dinner."</p> 
<p>"Let us then unto our holy gear, father," said Cedric.</p> 
<p>"Wait yet a moment, good uncle," said the Jester, in his natural tone; "better look long before you leap in the dark."</p> 
<p>"By my faith," said Cedric, "I should know that voice!"</p> 
<p>"It is that of your trusty slave and jester," answered Wamba, throwing back his cowl. "Had you taken a fool's advice formerly, you would not have been here at all. Take a fool's advice now, and you will not be here long."</p> 
<p>"How mean'st thou, knave?" answered the Saxon.</p> 
<p>"Even thus," replied Wamba; "take thou this frock and cord, which are all the orders I ever had, and march quietly out of the castle, leaving me your cloak and girdle to take the long leap in thy stead."</p> 
<p>"Leave thee in my stead!" said Cedric, astonished at the proposal; "why, they would hang thee, my poor knave."</p> 
<p>"E'en let them do as they are permitted," said Wamba; "I trust ---no disparagement to your birth---that the son of Witless may hang in a chain with as much gravity as the chain hung upon his ancestor the alderman."</p> 
<p>"Well, Wamba," answered Cedric, "for one thing will I grant thy request. And that is, if thou wilt make the exchange of garments with Lord Athelstane instead of me."</p> 
<p>"No, by St Dunstan," answered Wamba; "there were little reason in that. Good right there is, that the son of Witless should suffer to save the son of Hereward; but little wisdom there were in his dying for the benefit of one whose fathers were strangers to his."</p> 
<p>"Villain," said Cedric, "the fathers of Athelstane were monarchs of England!"</p> 
<p>"They might be whomsoever they pleased," replied Wamba; "but my neck stands too straight upon my shoulders to have it twisted for their sake. Wherefore, good my master, either take my proffer yourself, or suffer me to leave this dungeon as free as I entered."</p> 
<p>"Let the old tree wither," continued Cedric, "so the stately hope of the forest be preserved. Save the noble Athelstane, my trusty Wamba! it is the duty of each who has Saxon blood in his veins. Thou and I will abide together the utmost rage of our injurious oppressors, while he, free and safe, shall arouse the awakened spirits of our countrymen to avenge us."</p> 
<p>"Not so, father Cedric," said Athelstane, grasping his hand, ---for, when roused to think or act, his deeds and sentiments were not unbecoming his high race---"Not so," he continued; "I would rather remain in this hall a week without food save the prisoner's stinted loaf, or drink save the prisoner's measure of water, than embrace the opportunity to escape which the slave's untaught kindness has purveyed for his master."</p> 
<p>"You are called wise men, sirs," said the Jester, "and I a crazed fool; but, uncle Cedric, and cousin Athelstane, the fool shall decide this controversy for ye, and save ye the trouble of straining courtesies any farther. I am like John-a-Duck's mare, that will let no man mount her but John-a-Duck. I came to save my master, and if he will not consent---basta---I can but go away home again. Kind service cannot be chucked from hand to hand like a shuttlecock or stool-ball. I'll hang for no man but my own born master."</p> 
<p>"Go, then, noble Cedric," said Athelstane, "neglect not this opportunity. Your presence without may encourage friends to our rescue---your remaining here would ruin us all."</p> 
<p>"And is there any prospect, then, of rescue from without?" said Cedric, looking to the Jester.</p> 
<p>"Prospect, indeed!" echoed Wamba; "let me tell you, when you fill my cloak, you are wrapped in a general's cassock. Five hundred men are there without, and I was this morning one of the chief leaders. My fool's cap was a casque, and my bauble a truncheon. Well, we shall see what good they will make by exchanging a fool for a wise man. Truly, I fear they will lose in valour what they may gain in discretion. And so farewell, master, and be kind to poor Gurth and his dog Fangs; and let my cockscomb hang in the hall at Rotherwood, in memory that I flung away my life for my master, like a faithful------fool."</p> 
<p>The last word came out with a sort of double expression, betwixt jest and earnest. The tears stood in Cedric's eyes.</p> 
<p>"Thy memory shall be preserved," he said, "while fidelity and affection have honour upon earth! But that I trust I shall find the means of saving Rowena, and thee, Athelstane, and thee, also, my poor Wamba, thou shouldst not overbear me in this matter."</p> 
<p>The exchange of dress was now accomplished, when a sudden doubt struck Cedric.</p> 
<p>"I know no language," he said, "but my own, and a few words of their mincing Norman. How shall I bear myself like a reverend brother?"</p> 
<p>"The spell lies in two words," replied Wamba--- "'Pax vobiscum' will answer all queries. If you go or come, eat or drink, bless or ban, 'Pax vobiscum' carries you through it all. It is as useful to a friar as a broomstick to a witch, or a wand to a conjurer. Speak it but thus, in a deep grave tone,---'Pax vobiscum!'---it is irresistible---Watch and ward, knight and squire, foot and horse, it acts as a charm upon them all. I think, if they bring me out to be hanged to-morrow, as is much to be doubted they may, I will try its weight upon the finisher of the sentence."</p> 
<p>"If such prove the case," said the master, "my religious orders are soon taken---'Pax vobiscum'. I trust I shall remember the pass-word.---Noble Athelstane, farewell; and farewell, my poor boy, whose heart might make amends for a weaker head---I will save you, or return and die with you. The royal blood of our Saxon kings shall not be spilt while mine beats in my veins; nor shall one hair fall from the head of the kind knave who risked himself for his master, if Cedric's peril can prevent it. ---Farewell."</p> 
<p>"Farewell, noble Cedric," said Athelstane; "remember it is the true part of a friar to accept refreshment, if you are offered any."</p> 
<p>"Farewell, uncle," added Wamba; "and remember 'Pax vobiscum'."</p> 
<p>Thus exhorted, Cedric sallied forth upon his expedition; and it was not long ere he had occasion to try the force of that spell which his Jester had recommended as omnipotent. In a low-arched and dusky passage, by which he endeavoured to work his way to the hall of the castle, he was interrupted by a female form.</p> 
<p>"'Pax vobiscum!'" said the pseudo friar, and was endeavouring to hurry past, when a soft voice replied, "'Et vobis---quaso, domine reverendissime, pro misericordia vestra'."</p> 
<p>"I am somewhat deaf," replied Cedric, in good Saxon, and at the same time muttered to himself, "A curse on the fool and his 'Pax vobiscum!' I have lost my javelin at the first cast."</p> 
<p>It was, however, no unusual thing for a priest of those days to be deaf of his Latin ear, and this the person who now addressed Cedric knew full well.</p> 
<p>"I pray you of dear love, reverend father," she replied in his own language, "that you will deign to visit with your ghostly comfort a wounded prisoner of this castle, and have such compassion upon him and us as thy holy office teaches---Never shall good deed so highly advantage thy convent."</p> 
<p>"Daughter," answered Cedric, much embarrassed, "my time in this castle will not permit me to exercise the duties of mine office ---I must presently forth---there is life and death upon my speed."</p> 
<p>"Yet, father, let me entreat you by the vow you have taken on you," replied the suppliant, "not to leave the oppressed and endangered without counsel or succour."</p> 
<p>"May the fiend fly away with me, and leave me in Ifrin with the souls of Odin and of Thor!" answered Cedric impatiently, and would probably have proceeded in the same tone of total departure from his spiritual character, when the colloquy was interrupted by the harsh voice of Urfried, the old crone of the turret.</p> 
<p>"How, minion," said she to the female speaker, "is this the manner in which you requite the kindness which permitted thee to leave thy prison-cell yonder?---Puttest thou the reverend man to use ungracious language to free himself from the importunities of a Jewess?"</p> 
<p>"A Jewess!" said Cedric, availing himself of the information to get clear of their interruption,---"Let me pass, woman! stop me not at your peril. I am fresh from my holy office, and would avoid pollution."</p> 
<p>"Come this way, father," said the old hag, "thou art a stranger in this castle, and canst not leave it without a guide. Come hither, for I would speak with thee.---And you, daughter of an accursed race, go to the sick man's chamber, and tend him until my return; and woe betide you if you again quit it without my permission!"</p> 
<p>Rebecca retreated. Her importunities had prevailed upon Urfried to suffer her to quit the turret, and Urfried had employed her services where she herself would most gladly have paid them, by the bedside of the wounded Ivanhoe. With an understanding awake to their dangerous situation, and prompt to avail herself of each means of safety which occurred, Rebecca had hoped something from the presence of a man of religion, who, she learned from Urfried, had penetrated into this godless castle. She watched the return of the supposed ecclesiastic, with the purpose of addressing him, and interesting him in favour of the prisoners; with what imperfect success the reader has been just acquainted.</p>

<p>古歌谣</p> 
<p>小丑穿着隐士的长袍，戴着风帽，腰里来着打结的绳子，站在牛面将军的城堡门前，守门的卫兵要他通报姓名，说明来意。</p> 
<p>“Pax vobiscum，”小丑答道，“在下是圣方济各会的贫苦修士，现特前来为关在城堡中的几个不幸犯人做忏悔祷告。”</p> 
<p>“你好大的胆，敢到这儿来，”卫兵说道。“要知道，除了我们那个酗酒的神父以外，这二十年来，还从没你这样的灰毛公鸡在这儿啼过呢。”</p> 
<p>“请你还是把我的使命禀报你家老爷吧，”冒牌修士答道，“我保证，他一定欢迎这个消息；公鸡就要啼了，整个城堡都会听到。”</p> 
<p>“我的天，”卫兵说道，“但是如果我为了禀报你的使命，离开岗位挨了骂，你可得当心，看你这件灰色袍子是不是挡得住我这支灰色鹅毛箭。”</p> 
<p>他留下这个恐吓后，便离开塔楼，前往大厅报告那个不同寻常的消息了；他说，有一个神圣的修士来到城门外，要求立刻接见。令他大吃一惊的是，他的主人居然命令马上放修士入内；于是他先在大门口安排了警卫，提防突然袭击，然后便毫不迟疑地按照他接到的命令执行了。汪八只是一时心血来潮，才自告奋勇担当这个危险的差使，现在发现，牛面将军雷金纳德竟是这么一个凶神恶煞般的人物，心里不禁有些害怕。他照例先说了句“Pax vobiscum”，这主要是他相信它足以说明他的身分，但口气却不像以前那么轻松，显得结结巴巴的。不过牛面将军一向看到，各种人不论地位高低，都会在他面前发抖，因此对这位所谓神父的胆怯表现，丝毫不以为意。“你是谁，从哪里来，神父？”他问。</p> 
<p>“Pax vobiscum，”小丑又念叨了一遍，“在下是圣方济各会的贫苦修士，在路经这片荒野时，落进了一伙强盗手中，就像《圣经》说的：quidamviator incid it in latrones(注)；他们便派我进城堡来，因为听说大人秉公执法，要处死两名犯人，那些强盗要我来替他们履行宗教职责。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)当时的教士一般都应懂得拉丁文，汪八为了冒充教士，便在话中插入一些拉丁文，它们只是重复他前面或后面的话，也不一定来自《圣经》，下面也是这样。</p> 
<p>“嗯，你做得对，”牛面将军答道，“那么你能告诉我，森林里的强人有多少吗？”</p> 
<p>“大王，”小丑答道，“nomen illis legio——他们号称一个军团呢。”</p> 
<p>“告诉我究竟是多少数目，神父，要不然，你的长袍和腰带就不能保护你。”</p> 
<p>“哎哟！”假冒的修士说道，“cor meum eructavit，那就是说，当时我的头脑都给吓糊涂啦。不过我估计，那些庄稼人，加上老百姓，总数恐怕不下五百人吧。”</p> 
<p>“什么！”圣殿骑士说，他这时正好走进大厅，“这些马蜂已聚集了这么多人？这个马蜂窝是心腹之患，必须把它马上拔掉。”然后他把牛面将军叫到一边，又道：“你认识这个教士吗？”</p> 
<p>“他是从外地一个修道院来的，”牛面将军说，“我不认识他。”</p> 
<p>“那么不要把你的意图告诉他，”圣殿骑士答道，“只是让他捎个字条给德布拉西的自由团队，命令他们火速前来支援他们的主人。同时为了免得这个贼秃怀疑，你可以让他自由活动，为那些撒克逊猪秽作好上屠宰场的准备。”</p> 
<p>“我会这么办，”牛面将军说，随即指定了一个仆人，把汪八带往囚禁塞德里克和阿特尔斯坦的房间。</p> 
<p>塞德里克遭到囚禁之后，他的急躁脾气反而有增无减。他从大厅的一头踱到另一头，那副神气好像要向敌人发动进攻，或者从被围困的地方打开一个缺口，有时对自己，有时对阿特尔斯坦发出一声呐喊；阿特尔斯坦却不动声色地忍受着一切，等待事变的结束，同时泰然自若地消化中午吃下的大量食物；他对囚禁时间的长短似乎不太关心，认为世上的一切灾祸最终都会逢凶化吉，得到上帝的保佑。</p> 
<p>“Pax vohscum，”小丑说，一边走进了屋子，“愿圣邓斯坦、圣丹尼斯、圣达索克，以及其他各位圣徒保佑二位，与二位常在一起。”</p> 
<p>“不必客气，请进屋吧，”塞德里克对假想的修士说道，“不知足下到此有何贵干？”</p> 
<p>“在下是特地来侍候二位升天的，”小丑答道。</p> 
<p>“这不可能，”塞德里克吃了一惊，答道。“他们尽管心狠手辣，胆大妄为，还不敢公然倒行逆施，不顾天理人情。”</p> 
<p>“哎哟！”小丑说道，“要用人道观念约束他们的行为，那等于要用丝线作缰绳控制一匹奔跑的野马。现在，尊贵的塞德里克，请你考虑一下，英勇的阿特尔斯坦，也请你考虑一下，你们在世上犯过的罪孽，因为今天你们就得到上天的法庭上接受审判了。”</p> 
<p>“阿特尔斯坦，你听到没有？”塞德里克说。“我们必须鼓起勇气，迎接这最后一个行动；要知道，与其像奴隶一样活着，不如像自由人一样死去。”</p> 
<p>“我对他们的暴行已作好了最坏的打算，”阿特尔斯坦答道，“我会像就餐一样安详地走向死亡。”</p> 
<p>“那么让我们迎接这神圣的时刻吧，神父，”塞德里克说。</p> 
<p>“再等一等，老爷子，”小丑说，恢复了平时的声调，“在你跳进黑暗的深渊以前，还是先仔细看看的好。”</p> 
<p>“我担保，这声音很熟悉！”塞德里克说。</p> 
<p>“那是你忠实的奴隶和小丑的声音，”汪八接口道，揭开了风帽，“要是你以前肯听从傻瓜的劝告，今天就不用待在这儿了。现在你肯照傻瓜的话办，也可以很快就离开这里。”</p> 
<p>“你这小子，这是什么意思？”撒克逊人问道。</p> 
<p>“你听清楚了，”汪八答道，“穿上这件袍子，系上这根绳子，它们是我所有的修士的全部标志，然后你就泰然自若地走出城堡，让我穿上你的大褂，系上你的腰带，代替你升入天堂。”</p> 
<p>“让你代替我！”塞德里克说，听到这建议吃了一惊。“得啦，他们会绞死你，我可怜的小傻瓜。”</p> 
<p>“随他们爱怎么办就怎么办吧，”汪八说。“我这么做丝毫也不想贬低你的身分，我相信，愚人之子挂在绞索上，不会比他做官的祖先当年挂在绞索上轻一些。”</p> 
<p>“好吧，汪八，”塞德里克答道，“我答应你的要求，但有个条件，那就是我要你跟阿特尔斯坦老爷交换服装，不是跟我。”</p> 
<p>“凭圣邓斯坦作证，这不成，”汪八答道，“那么做没有道理。愚人之子搭救赫里沃德的后代，这是名正言顺的事；但是要他为另一个人死，这个人的祖先却与他风马牛不相关，这就不合情理了。”</p> 
<p>“混蛋，”塞德里克说，“阿特尔斯坦的祖先是英国的国王！”</p> 
<p>“随他们是什么人，我不在乎，”汪八答道，“但我的脖子生在我的肩膀上，我不能为随便什么人绞断它。因此，我的好东家，要就你自己接受我的建议，要就让我像来的时候一样，自由的离开这间牢房。”</p> 
<p>“让我这棵老树枯死吧，”塞德里克继续道，“只要树林还保存着繁荣的希望。我忠实可靠的汪八，救救高贵的阿特尔斯坦！凡是血管里有撒克逊血统的人都有这个责任。你和我可以一起忍受残忍的压迫者的最大暴行，但是让他得到自由和安全，他会唤起全国民众的斗志，为我们报仇的。”</p> 
<p>“不必这么做，塞德里克伯父，”阿特尔斯坦说，握紧了他的手，因为在他精神振奋，认真思考或行动的时候，他的举止和感情不是与他的高贵出身不相符合的。 “不必这么做，”他继续道，“我宁可在这大厅里再待一周，除了一小块面包什么吃的也没有，或者除了给犯人的一点水，什么喝的也没有，也不愿把这个奴隶诚心诚意献给他主人的逃跑机会，占为己有。”</p> 
<p>“两位老爷，你们都是聪明人，”小丑说道，“我只是疯子和傻瓜，但是现在，塞德里克老爷子和阿特尔斯坦朋友，让傻瓜替你们解决争论吧，免得你们多化力气，互相推让。我像约翰·达克的那匹母马，除了约翰·达克，谁也不让骑。我是来搭救我的主人的，如果他不要我救，那就只好拉倒！我只得仍旧回去。善意的帮助不是毽子或板球，可以由这个人抛给另一个人的。除了为我生来的主人，我不能为任何别人吊死！”</p> 
<p>“那么去吧，尊贵的塞德里克，”阿特尔斯坦说，“不要错过这个机会。你到了外面，可以发动亲友前来搭救我们；你留在这儿，我们只能一起完蛋。”</p> 
<p>“那么我们在外面有没有获得救援的希望？”塞德里克望着小丑说。</p> 
<p>“希望确实是有的！”汪八立即答道，“我可以告诉你，你穿上我的袍子，就是披上了将军的战袍。外面已集中了五百人，今天早晨我还是他们的主要领导人之一。我的小丑帽子是头盔，我的小丑手杖便是权杖。好吧，我们会看到，一个傻瓜换了一个聪明人，这会得到什么好处。确实，这么一来，他们可能谨慎有余，勇敢却不足了。好吧，再见，老爷，好好对待可怜的葛四和他的狗方斯；把我的小丑帽子挂在罗瑟伍德的大厅上，作为我为主人抛弃生命的纪念，让大家知道我对他忠心耿耿，尽管我是个傻瓜。”最后这句话带有双重意味，既像说笑，又像是当真的。</p> 
<p>塞德里克的眼睛里噙满了泪水。“只要忠诚和友谊在世上还受到尊敬，这纪念品就会永远保存在那里！”他说。“我相信，我能找到办法，搭救罗文娜和你，阿特尔斯坦，还有你，我可怜的汪八，在这件事上，我不会丢掉你不管的。”</p> 
<p>现在衣服换好了，塞德里克突然想起了一个问题。</p> 
<p>“我除了自己的语言，以及几句不三不四的诺曼话，什么语言也不会讲，”他说。“我怎么能像一个神父呢？”</p> 
<p>“诀窍只有两个字：Pax vobiscum，”汪八答道。“它可以回答一切询问。不论你来或去，吃或喝，赞美或反对，Pax vobiscum可以无往而不利。它对于一个修士的用处，就像巫婆手中的扫帚，魔术师手中的棍子。你得这么念，声调低沉庄重：Pax vobiscum，它可以带着你通行无阻。不论门岗和守卫，骑士和扈从，步兵和骑兵，它对他们像符咒一样，全都管用。我想，明天他们多半会把我送上绞架，到那时，我也得对处死我的刽子手试试它的威力。”</p> 
<p>“如果情况果真如此，”他的主人说，“那么我的教会授职仪式太简单了——Paxvobiscum。我相信，这句口令我能记住。高贵的阿特尔斯坦，再见；再见，我可怜的孩子，你的心抵消了你头脑的缺陷；我会救你脱险，否则也会回来与你一起死的。只要我的血管里还流着血，我就不会让撒克逊王族的血统就此中断；只要能救出为主人出生人死的奴仆，塞德里克哪怕得冒九死一生的危险，也决不会让人伤害他的一根头发。再见。”</p> 
<p>“再见，尊贵的塞德里克，”阿特尔斯坦说，“记住，如果有人向你布施食物，你便得接受，这才像一个游方修士。”</p> 
<p>“再见，老爷子，”汪八又道，“记住PCX VohSC。”</p> 
<p>经过这一番叮嘱之后，塞德里克便出发了；不用多久，小丑作为万应灵丹介绍给他的那句咒语，他便有了应用的机会，可以试试它的效果了。在一条矮拱顶的阴暗过道中，他正摸索前行，要上城堡的大厅，这时一个女人的身影突然挡住了他的去路。</p> 
<p>“Pax vobiscum！”假修士说，竭力想赶快通过。但那女子用温柔的声音说道：“Et vobls；quaeso，domlne reverendisslme，pro miserlcordia yestra.”(注)</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)拉丁文：也祝您平安；尊敬的神父，请您行行好吧。</p> 
<p>“我的耳朵不太好，”塞德里克用纯正的撒克逊语答道，同时在心里叨咕：“该死的傻瓜和他的Pax vobiscum！我的梭镖第一次就没打中。”</p> 
<p>然而当时的教士听到拉丁文便耳聋的并不少见，跟塞德里克谈话的那个女子完全理解这点。</p> 
<p>“我要求您发发慈悲，尊敬的神父，”她改用他的语言答道，”请您去看看关在城堡内的一个伤员，让他的灵魂得到安慰；请您按照您的神圣职务的教导，怜悯怜悯他和我们吧。这对您是功德无量的事。”</p> 
<p>“孩子，”塞德里克非常慌张，答道，“我在这城堡内的时间有限，不允许我行使这些职责。我必须马上离开，有一件涉及生死存亡的大事等着我去办呢。”</p> 
<p>“然而，神父，让我用您起过的誓言请求您吧，”求情者又道，“不要抛弃遇到危险和困难的人，为他想想办法，救救他吧。”</p> 
<p>“让魔鬼把我架走，送进地狱，跟奥丁和托尔(注)的灵魂在一起吧！”塞德里克说，心里焦急万分；如果让他再这么讲下去，也许他非背离他的宗教身分，露出马脚不可，幸好他们的谈话，这时给塔楼内的老太婆厄弗利德的粗哑嗓音打断了。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)托尔与奥丁一样，也是古代斯堪的纳维亚的神，由于他们都是基督教兴起前的异教时代的神，因此说他们的灵魂都在地狱中。</p> 
<p>“喂，小丫头，”她对那个女子说道，“我好意让你离开那边的牢房，到外面走走，你却这么报答我吗？你逼得这位神父不得不用诅咒的话，摆脱一个犹太女子的纠缠，这么做应该吗？”</p> 
<p>“一个犹太女子！”塞德里克说，想利用这消息乘机脱身，“让我过去，小女子！不要挡住我，免得我对你不客气。我刚行过圣事，不能与异教徒接触。”</p> 
<p>“到这儿来，神父，”老婆子说，“你在城堡中是陌生人，没人带路跑不出去。到这儿来，我有话跟你讲。还有，你这个不祥民族的小妮子，回病人屋里去照顾他，等我回来；要是你不得到我的准许再走出屋子，当心我跟你算账！”</p> 
<p>丽贝卡退下了。由于她的再三恳求，厄弗利德才允许她离开塔楼，去从事她心甘情愿担当的任务，在受伤的艾文荷的病榻旁照料他。她意识到了他们的危险处境，决心利用她能得到的一切活命机会，这样，当厄弗利德告诉她，一个教士进入了这个不信上帝的城堡时，她萌发了希望，守候在过道上，等待那个假想的教士回来，打算敦促他关心一下囚徒们的命运；但是读者们已经看到，她的愿望没有完全达到。</p>
