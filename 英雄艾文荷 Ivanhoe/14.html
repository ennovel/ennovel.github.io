There is no more to say, but east and west, In go the speares sadly in the rest, In goth the sharp spur into the side, There see men who can just and who can ride; There shiver shaftes upon shieldes thick, He feeleth through the heart-spone the prick; Up springen speares, twenty feet in height, Out go the swordes to the silver bright; The helms they to-hewn and to-shred; Out burst the blood with stern streames red. Chaucer.</p> 
<p>Morning arose in unclouded splendour, and ere the sun was much above the horizon, the idlest or the most eager of the spectators appeared on the common, moving to the lists as to a general centre, in order to secure a favourable situation for viewing the continuation of the expected games.</p> 
<p>The marshals and their attendants appeared next on the field, together with the heralds, for the purpose of receiving the names of the knights who intended to joust, with the side which each chose to espouse. This was a necessary precaution, in order to secure equality betwixt the two bodies who should be opposed to each other.</p> 
<p>According to due formality, the Disinherited Knight was to be considered as leader of the one body, while Brian de Bois-Guilbert, who had been rated as having done second-best in the preceding day, was named first champion of the other band. Those who had concurred in the challenge adhered to his party of course, excepting only Ralph de Vipont, whom his fall had rendered unfit so soon to put on his armour. There was no want of distinguished and noble candidates to fill up the ranks on either side.</p> 
<p>In fact, although the general tournament, in which all knights fought at once, was more dangerous than single encounters, they were, nevertheless, more frequented and practised by the chivalry of the age. Many knights, who had not sufficient confidence in their own skill to defy a single adversary of high reputation, were, nevertheless, desirous of displaying their valour in the general combat, where they might meet others with whom they were more upon an equality. On the present occasion, about fifty knights were inscribed as desirous of combating upon each side, when the marshals declared that no more could be admitted, to the disappointment of several who were too late in preferring their claim to be included.</p> 
<p>About the hour of ten o'clock, the whole plain was crowded with horsemen, horsewomen, and foot-passengers, hastening to the tournament; and shortly after, a grand flourish of trumpets announced Prince John and his retinue, attended by many of those knights who meant to take share in the game, as well as others who had no such intention.</p> 
<p>About the same time arrived Cedric the Saxon, with the Lady Rowena, unattended, however, by Athelstane. This Saxon lord had arrayed his tall and strong person in armour, in order to take his place among the combatants; and, considerably to the surprise of Cedric, had chosen to enlist himself on the part of the Knight Templar. The Saxon, indeed, had remonstrated strongly with his friend upon the injudicious choice he had made of his party; but he had only received that sort of answer usually given by those who are more obstinate in following their own course, than strong in justifying it.</p> 
<p>His best, if not his only reason, for adhering to the party of Brian de Bois-Guilbert, Athelstane had the prudence to keep to himself. Though his apathy of disposition prevented his taking any means to recommend himself to the Lady Rowena, he was, nevertheless, by no means insensible to her charms, and considered his union with her as a matter already fixed beyond doubt, by the assent of Cedric and her other friends. It had therefore been with smothered displeasure that the proud though indolent Lord of Coningsburgh beheld the victor of the preceding day select Rowena as the object of that honour which it became his privilege to confer. In order to punish him for a preference which seemed to interfere with his own suit, Athelstane, confident of his strength, and to whom his flatterers, at least, ascribed great skill in arms, had determined not only to deprive the Disinherited Knight of his powerful succour, but, if an opportunity should occur, to make him feel the weight of his battle-axe.</p> 
<p>De Bracy, and other knights attached to Prince John, in obedience to a hint from him, had joined the party of the challengers, John being desirous to secure, if possible, the victory to that side. On the other hand, many other knights, both English and Norman, natives and strangers, took part against the challengers, the more readily that the opposite band was to be led by so distinguished a champion as the Disinherited Knight had approved himself.</p> 
<p>As soon as Prince John observed that the destined Queen of the day had arrived upon the field, assuming that air of courtesy which sat well upon him when he was pleased to exhibit it, he rode forward to meet her, doffed his bonnet, and, alighting from his horse, assisted the Lady Rowena from her saddle, while his followers uncovered at the same time, and one of the most distinguished dismounted to hold her palfrey.</p> 
<p>"It is thus," said Prince John, "that we set the dutiful example of loyalty to the Queen of Love and Beauty, and are ourselves her guide to the throne which she must this day occupy.---Ladies," he said, "attend your Queen, as you wish in your turn to be distinguished by like honours."</p> 
<p>So saying, the Prince marshalled Rowena to the seat of honour opposite his own, while the fairest and most distinguished ladies present crowded after her to obtain places as near as possible to their temporary sovereign.</p> 
<p>No sooner was Rowena seated, than a burst of music, half-drowned by the shouts of the multitude, greeted her new dignity. Meantime, the sun shone fierce and bright upon the polished arms of the knights of either side, who crowded the opposite extremities of the lists, and held eager conference together concerning the best mode of arranging their line of battle, and supporting the conflict.</p> 
<p>The heralds then proclaimed silence until the laws of the tourney should be rehearsed. These were calculated in some degree to abate the dangers of the day; a precaution the more necessary, as the conflict was to be maintained with sharp swords and pointed lances.</p> 
<p>The champions were therefore prohibited to thrust with the sword, and were confined to striking. A knight, it was announced, might use a mace or battle-axe at pleasure, but the dagger was a prohibited weapon. A knight unhorsed might renew the fight on foot with any other on the opposite side in the same predicament; but mounted horsemen were in that case forbidden to assail him. When any knight could force his antagonist to the extremity of the lists, so as to touch the palisade with his person or arms, such opponent was obliged to yield himself vanquished, and his armour and horse were placed at the disposal of the conqueror. A knight thus overcome was not permitted to take farther share in the combat. If any combatant was struck down, and unable to recover his feet, his squire or page might enter the lists, and drag his master out of the press; but in that case the knight was adjudged vanquished, and his arms and horse declared forfeited. The combat was to cease as soon as Prince John should throw down his leading staff, or truncheon; another precaution usually taken to prevent the unnecessary effusion of blood by the too long endurance of a sport so desperate. Any knight breaking the rules of the tournament, or otherwise transgressing the rules of honourable chivalry, was liable to be stript of his arms, and, having his shield reversed to be placed in that posture astride upon the bars of the palisade, and exposed to public derision, in punishment of his unknightly conduct. Having announced these precautions, the heralds concluded with an exhortation to each good knight to do his duty, and to merit favour from the Queen of Beauty and of Love.</p> 
<p>This proclamation having been made, the heralds withdrew to their stations. The knights, entering at either end of the lists in long procession, arranged themselves in a double file, precisely opposite to each other, the leader of each party being in the centre of the foremost rank, a post which he did not occupy until each had carefully marshalled the ranks of his party, and stationed every one in his place.</p> 
<p>It was a goodly, and at the same time an anxious, sight, to behold so many gallant champions, mounted bravely, and armed richly, stand ready prepared for an encounter so formidable, seated on their war-saddles like so many pillars of iron, and awaiting the signal of encounter with the same ardour as their generous steeds, which, by neighing and pawing the ground, gave signal of their impatience.</p> 
<p>As yet the knights held their long lances upright, their bright points glancing to the sun, and the streamers with which they were decorated fluttering over the plumage of the helmets. Thus they remained while the marshals of the field surveyed their ranks with the utmost exactness, lest either party had more or fewer than the appointed number. The tale was found exactly complete. The marshals then withdrew from the lists, and William de Wyvil, with a voice of thunder, pronounced the signal words --"Laissez aller!" The trumpets sounded as he spoke---the spears of the champions were at once lowered and placed in the rests ---the spurs were dashed into the flanks of the horses, and the two foremost ranks of either party rushed upon each other in full gallop, and met in the middle of the lists with a shock, the sound of which was heard at a mile's distance. The rear rank of each party advanced at a slower pace to sustain the defeated, and follow up the success of the victors of their party.</p> 
<p>The consequences of the encounter were not instantly seen, for the dust raised by the trampling of so many steeds darkened the air, and it was a minute ere the anxious spectator could see the fate of the encounter. When the fight became visible, half the knights on each side were dismounted, some by the dexterity of their adversary's lance,---some by the superior weight and strength of opponents, which had borne down both horse and man, ---some lay stretched on earth as if never more to rise,---some had already gained their feet, and were closing hand to hand with those of their antagonists who were in the same predicament, ---and several on both sides, who had received wounds by which they were disabled, were stopping their blood by their scarfs, and endeavouring to extricate themselves from the tumult. The mounted knights, whose lances had been almost all broken by the fury of the encounter, were now closely engaged with their swords, shouting their war-cries, and exchanging buffets, as if honour and life depended on the issue of the combat.</p> 
<p>The tumult was presently increased by the advance of the second rank on either side, which, acting as a reserve, now rushed on to aid their companions. The followers of Brian de Bois-Guilbert shouted ---"Ha! Beau-seant! Beau-seant!*</p> 
<p>* "Beau-seant" was the name of the Templars' banner, which * was half black, half white, to intimate, it is said, that * they were candid and fair towards Christians, but black * and terrible towards infidels.</p> 
<p>"--- For the Temple---For the Temple!" The opposite party shouted in answer---"Desdichado! Desdichado!"---which watch-word they took from the motto upon their leader's shield.</p> 
<p>The champions thus encountering each other with the utmost fury, and with alternate success, the tide of battle seemed to flow now toward the southern, now toward the northern extremity of the lists, as the one or the other party prevailed. Meantime the clang of the blows, and the shouts of the combatants, mixed fearfully with the sound of the trumpets, and drowned the groans of those who fell, and lay rolling defenceless beneath the feet of the horses. The splendid armour of the combatants was now defaced with dust and blood, and gave way at every stroke of the sword and battle-axe. The gay plumage, shorn from the crests, drifted upon the breeze like snow-flakes. All that was beautiful and graceful in the martial array had disappeared, and what was now visible was only calculated to awake terror or compassion.</p> 
<p>Yet such is the force of habit, that not only the vulgar spectators, who are naturally attracted by sights of horror, but even the ladies of distinction who crowded the galleries, saw the conflict with a thrilling interest certainly, but without a wish to withdraw their eyes from a sight so terrible. Here and there, indeed, a fair cheek might turn pale, or a faint scream might be heard, as a lover, a brother, or a husband, was struck from his horse. But, in general, the ladies around encouraged the combatants, not only by clapping their hands and waving their veils and kerchiefs, but even by exclaiming, "Brave lance! Good sword!" when any successful thrust or blow took place under their observation.</p> 
<p>Such being the interest taken by the fair sex in this bloody game, that of the men is the more easily understood. It showed itself in loud acclamations upon every change of fortune, while all eyes were so riveted on the lists, that the spectators seemed as if they themselves had dealt and received the blows which were there so freely bestowed. And between every pause was heard the voice of the heralds, exclaiming, "Fight on, brave knights! Man dies, but glory lives!---Fight on---death is better than defeat! ---Fight on, brave knights!---for bright eyes behold your deeds!"</p> 
<p>Amid the varied fortunes of the combat, the eyes of all endeavoured to discover the leaders of each band, who, mingling in the thick of the fight, encouraged their companions both by voice and example. Both displayed great feats of gallantry, nor did either Bois-Guilbert or the Disinherited Knight find in the ranks opposed to them a champion who could be termed their unquestioned match. They repeatedly endeavoured to single out each other, spurred by mutual animosity, and aware that the fall of either leader might be considered as decisive of victory. Such, however, was the crowd and confusion, that, during the earlier part of the conflict, their efforts to meet were unavailing, and they were repeatedly separated by the eagerness of their followers, each of whom was anxious to win honour, by measuring his strength against the leader of the opposite party.</p> 
<p>But when the field became thin by the numbers on either side who had yielded themselves vanquished, had been compelled to the extremity of the lists, or been otherwise rendered incapable of continuing the strife, the Templar and the Disinherited Knight at length encountered hand to hand, with all the fury that mortal animosity, joined to rivalry of honour, could inspire. Such was the address of each in parrying and striking, that the spectators broke forth into a unanimous and involuntary shout, expressive of their delight and admiration.</p> 
<p>But at this moment the party of the Disinherited Knight had the worst; the gigantic arm of Front-de-Boeuf on the one flank, and the ponderous strength of Athelstane on the other, bearing down and dispersing those immediately exposed to them. Finding themselves freed from their immediate antagonists, it seems to have occurred to both these knights at the same instant, that they would render the most decisive advantage to their party, by aiding the Templar in his contest with his rival. Turning their horses, therefore, at the same moment, the Norman spurred against the Disinherited Knight on the one side, and the Saxon on the other. It was utterly impossible that the object of this unequal and unexpected assault could have sustained it, had he not been warned by a general cry from the spectators, who could not but take interest in one exposed to such disadvantage.</p> 
<p>"Beware! beware! Sir Disinherited!" was shouted so universally, that the knight became aware of his danger; and, striking a full blow at the Templar, he reined back his steed in the same moment, so as to escape the charge of Athelstane and Front-de-Boeuf. These knights, therefore, their aim being thus eluded, rushed from opposite sides betwixt the object of their attack and the Templar, almost running their horses against each other ere they could stop their career. Recovering their horses however, and wheeling them round, the whole three pursued their united purpose of bearing to the earth the Disinherited Knight.</p> 
<p>Nothing could have saved him, except the remarkable strength and activity of the noble horse which he had won on the preceding day.</p> 
<p>This stood him in the more stead, as the horse of Bois-Guilbert was wounded, and those of Front-de-Boeuf and Athelstane were both tired with the weight of their gigantic masters, clad in complete armour, and with the preceding exertions of the day. The masterly horsemanship of the Disinherited Knight, and the activity of the noble animal which he mounted, enabled him for a few minutes to keep at sword's point his three antagonists, turning and wheeling with the agility of a hawk upon the wing, keeping his enemies as far separate as he could, and rushing now against the one, now against the other, dealing sweeping blows with his sword, without waiting to receive those which were aimed at him in return.</p> 
<p>But although the lists rang with the applauses of his dexterity, it was evident that he must at last be overpowered; and the nobles around Prince John implored him with one voice to throw down his warder, and to save so brave a knight from the disgrace of being overcome by odds.</p> 
<p>"Not I, by the light of Heaven!" answered Prince John; "this same springald, who conceals his name, and despises our proffered hospitality, hath already gained one prize, and may now afford to let others have their turn." As he spoke thus, an unexpected incident changed the fortune of the day.</p> 
<p>There was among the ranks of the Disinherited Knight a champion in black armour, mounted on a black horse, large of size, tall, and to all appearance powerful and strong, like the rider by whom he was mounted, This knight, who bore on his shield no device of any kind, had hitherto evinced very little interest in the event of the fight, beating off with seeming ease those combatants who attacked him, but neither pursuing his advantages, nor himself assailing any one. In short, he had hitherto acted the part rather of a spectator than of a party in the tournament, a circumstance which procured him among the spectators the name of "Le Noir Faineant", or the Black Sluggard.</p> 
<p>At once this knight seemed to throw aside his apathy, when he discovered the leader of his party so hard bestead; for, setting spurs to his horse, which was quite fresh, he came to his assistance like a thunderbolt, exclaiming, in a voice like a trumpet-call, "Desdichado, to the rescue!" It was high time; for, while the Disinherited Knight was pressing upon the Templar, Front-de-Boeuf had got nigh to him with his uplifted sword; but ere the blow could descend, the Sable Knight dealt a stroke on his head, which, glancing from the polished helmet, lighted with violence scarcely abated on the "chamfron" of the steed, and Front-de-Boeuf rolled on the ground, both horse and man equally stunned by the fury of the blow. "Le Noir Faineant" then turned his horse upon Athelstane of Coningsburgh; and his own sword having been broken in his encounter with Front-de-Boeuf, he wrenched from the hand of the bulky Saxon the battle-axe which he wielded, and, like one familiar with the use of the weapon, bestowed him such a blow upon the crest, that Athelstane also lay senseless on the field. Having achieved this double feat, for which he was the more highly applauded that it was totally unexpected from him, the knight seemed to resume the sluggishness of his character, returning calmly to the northern extremity of the lists, leaving his leader to cope as he best could with Brian de Bois-Guilbert. This was no longer matter of so much difficulty as formerly. The Templars horse had bled much, and gave way under the shock of the Disinherited Knight's charge. Brian de Bois-Guilbert rolled on the field, encumbered with the stirrup, from which he was unable to draw his foot. His antagonist sprung from horseback, waved his fatal sword over the head of his adversary, and commanded him to yield himself; when Prince John, more moved by the Templars dangerous situation than he had been by that of his rival, saved him the mortification of confessing himself vanquished, by casting down his warder, and putting an end to the conflict.</p> 
<p>It was, indeed, only the relics and embers of the fight which continued to burn; for of the few knights who still continued in the lists, the greater part had, by tacit consent, forborne the conflict for some time, leaving it to be determined by the strife of the leaders.</p> 
<p>The squires, who had found it a matter of danger and difficulty to attend their masters during the engagement, now thronged into the lists to pay their dutiful attendance to the wounded, who were removed with the utmost care and attention to the neighbouring pavilions, or to the quarters prepared for them in the adjoining village.</p> 
<p>Thus ended the memorable field of Ashby-de-la-Zouche, one of the most gallantly contested tournaments of that age; for although only four knights, including one who was smothered by the heat of his armour, had died upon the field, yet upwards of thirty were desperately wounded, four or five of whom never recovered. Several more were disabled for life; and those who escaped best carried the marks of the conflict to the grave with them. Hence it is always mentioned in the old records, as the Gentle and Joyous Passage of Arms of Ashby.</p> 
<p>It being now the duty of Prince John to name the knight who had done best, he determined that the honour of the day remained with the knight whom the popular voice had termed "Le Noir Faineant." It was pointed out to the Prince, in impeachment of this decree, that the victory had been in fact won by the Disinherited Knight, who, in the course of the day, had overcome six champions with his own hand, and who had finally unhorsed and struck down the leader of the opposite party. But Prince John adhered to his own opinion, on the ground that the Disinherited Knight and his party had lost the day, but for the powerful assistance of the Knight of the Black Armour, to whom, therefore, he persisted in awarding the prize.</p> 
<p>To the surprise of all present, however, the knight thus preferred was nowhere to be found. He had left the lists immediately when the conflict ceased, and had been observed by some spectators to move down one of the forest glades with the same slow pace and listless and indifferent manner which had procured him the epithet of the Black Sluggard. After he had been summoned twice by sound of trumpet, and proclamation of the heralds, it became necessary to name another to receive the honours which had been assigned to him. Prince John had now no further excuse for resisting the claim of the Disinherited Knight, whom, therefore, he named the champion of the day.</p> 
<p>Through a field slippery with blood, and encumbered with broken armour and the bodies of slain and wounded horses, the marshals of the lists again conducted the victor to the foot of Prince John's throne.</p> 
<p>"Disinherited Knight," said Prince John, "since by that title only you will consent to be known to us, we a second time award to you the honours of this tournament, and announce to you your right to claim and receive from the hands of the Queen of Love and Beauty, the Chaplet of Honour which your valour has justly deserved." The Knight bowed low and gracefully, but returned no answer.</p> 
<p>While the trumpets sounded, while the heralds strained their voices in proclaiming honour to the brave and glory to the victor ---while ladies waved their silken kerchiefs and embroidered veils, and while all ranks joined in a clamorous shout of exultation, the marshals conducted the Disinherited Knight across the lists to the foot of that throne of honour which was occupied by the Lady Rowena.</p> 
<p>On the lower step of this throne the champion was made to kneel down. Indeed his whole action since the fight had ended, seemed rather to have been upon the impulse of those around him than from his own free will; and it was observed that he tottered as they guided him the second time across the lists. Rowena, descending from her station with a graceful and dignified step, was about to place the chaplet which she held in her hand upon the helmet of the champion, when the marshals exclaimed with one voice, "It must not be thus---his head must be bare." The knight muttered faintly a few words, which were lost in the hollow of his helmet, but their purport seemed to be a desire that his casque might not be removed.</p> 
<p>Whether from love of form, or from curiosity, the marshals paid no attention to his expressions of reluctance, but unhelmed him by cutting the laces of his casque, and undoing the fastening of his gorget. When the helmet was removed, the well-formed, yet sun-burnt features of a young man of twenty-five were seen, amidst a profusion of short fair hair. His countenance was as pale as death, and marked in one or two places with streaks of blood.</p> 
<p>Rowena had no sooner beheld him than she uttered a faint shriek; but at once summoning up the energy of her disposition, and compelling herself, as it were, to proceed, while her frame yet trembled with the violence of sudden emotion, she placed upon the drooping head of the victor the splendid chaplet which was the destined reward of the day, and pronounced, in a clear and distinct tone, these words: "I bestow on thee this chaplet, Sir Knight, as the meed of valour assigned to this day's victor:" Here she paused a moment, and then firmly added, "And upon brows more worthy could a wreath of chivalry never be placed!"</p> 
<p>The knight stooped his head, and kissed the hand of the lovely Sovereign by whom his valour had been rewarded; and then, sinking yet farther forward, lay prostrate at her feet.</p> 
<p>There was a general consternation. Cedric, who had been struck mute by the sudden appearance of his banished son, now rushed forward, as if to separate him from Rowena. But this had been already accomplished by the marshals of the field, who, guessing the cause of Ivanhoe's swoon, had hastened to undo his armour, and found that the head of a lance had penetrated his breastplate, and inflicted a wound in his side.</p>

<p>(注)引自乔叟的《坎特伯雷故事集》中《骑士的故事》。</p> 
<p>曙光刚在灿烂无云的碧空中出现，太阳刚从地平线上冉冉升起，不论最懒惰的还是最热心的观众，便已来到大路上，纷纷向比武场这个共同的中心汇集，以便找到一个称心如意的位置，继续观看万众瞩目的比赛。</p> 
<p>接着，警卫督察和他们的部属，也到达了场内，会同典礼官登记要求参加比武的骑士的姓名，以及他们希望参加的一方。这是必要的准备，可以保证比赛双方人数相等。</p> 
<p>按照规定，剥夺继承权的骑士应该充当一方的带头人，布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔在前一天排在第二名，他便被指定为另一方的首席斗士。那些与他一起担任挑战者的人，当然便属于他这一边，只有拉尔夫·维庞特不在其内，因为他摔下马背时受了伤，不宜立即穿上盔甲。反正场上有的是武艺高强的优秀骑士，可以补充双方的队伍。</p> 
<p>事实上，团体比武虽然是所有的骑士同时上场，危险比单人比赛更大，可是在当时却是更常见的比武方式。许多骑士对自己的武艺缺乏信心，不敢与素负盛名的骑士单独比赛，便想在共同的战斗中显露头角，指望在那里找到旗鼓相当的对手。在目前这场合，登记参加比武的，每一边大约已多达五十人，于是警卫督察宣布停止报名，致使那些稍迟提出要求的，只得向隅了。</p> 
<p>到了十点钟左右，整个平原上，骑马和步行的男女老少已到处可见，大家都在匆匆奔赴比武大会；过了不久，响亮的号音宣告了约翰亲王和他的随员的到达，无数将要参加比武或者不打算参加的骑士簇拥在他们后面。</p> 
<p>大约与此同时，撒克逊人塞德里克也到达了，他带着罗文娜小姐，然而阿特尔斯坦没有与他们在一起。这位撒克逊贵族已在高大强壮的身体上：穿好了盔甲，准备在比武中占有一席位置；令塞德里克大吃一惊的是，他报名参加的却是圣殿骑士一边。确实，塞德里克对这位朋友提出了强烈抗议，认为他的选择简直不可理喻、但得到的不是合理的解释，只是一意孤行的人通常作出的固执回答。</p> 
<p>其实阿特尔斯坦选择布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔一边是有原因的，即使这不是唯一的，也是他最充足的理由，只是为了谨慎，他不愿公开而已。原来尽管他疏懒成性，从来不屑以任何方式向罗文娜小姐表示爱慕之意，他对她的美貌绝不是无动于衷的，而且认为他与她的结合，早已得到塞德里克和她的其他亲属首肯，因而已是确定无疑的事。因此前一天的优胜者选择罗文娜作女王时，这位自负而又懒散的科宁斯堡领主不免闷闷不乐，认为只有他才有资格授予她这种荣誉。就为了这个原因，阿特尔斯坦决定要惩罚那个侵犯了他的特权的优胜者。他相信自己力大无穷，奉承他的人至少还夸赞他武艺超群，这使他不仅不愿让剥夺继承权的骑士得到他的强大支援，而且在机会许可时，还要叫他尝尝自己那把战斧的威力。</p> 
<p>德布拉西和约翰亲王身边的其他骑士，遵照他的示意，参加了挑战者一边；亲王决心尽可能帮助这一边取得胜利。另一方面，其他许多武士，包括英格兰人和诺曼人，本地人和外来人，却参加了反对挑战者的一边；因为大家看到，这一边是由剥夺继承权的骑士领头的，这个杰出的勇士的英勇无敌，在前一天的比赛中已得到证实。</p> 
<p>约翰亲王一看到这天选定的女王到达比武场，立刻装出一副彬彬有礼的神气迎了上去；在他需要表现这种脸色的时候，那是轻而易举的，他摘下帽子，从马上下来，把罗文娜小姐搀下了马鞍；这时他的随从们也纷纷摘下帽子，一个最显赫的官员还跨下马背，牵住了她的小马。</p> 
<p>“我们就是这么作出表率，让大家知道应该怎样效忠于爱和美的女王的，”约翰亲王说，“我还要亲自引导她登上她今天理应占有的宝座呢。小姐们，”他又说，“好好侍候你们的女王，你们将来也是有希望获得这样的荣誉的。”</p> 
<p>亲王一边这么说，一边便带领罗文娜，登上了他对面看台上的宝座；那些天仙美女般的阔小姐簇拥在她后面，也一个个占有了各自的位置，尽可能靠近这位临时女王。</p> 
<p>罗文娜坐下不久，音乐便开始演奏了，但是群众为她新的尊贵身分发出的欢呼更响，湮没了一半乐声。这时，太阳射出的强烈光线，已把两边骑士的武器照得闪闪发亮。他们拥挤在场子两端，正在热烈讨论怎样安排各自的阵容，以及迎接战斗的最好方式。</p> 
<p>然后典礼官请大家肃静，宣读了比武的规则。在一定程度上，它们是为了减少今天比武的危险性——由于比武是用锋利的刀剑和枪矛进行的，这种预防措施更其必要。</p> 
<p>根据规则，比武时不得用剑冲刺，只限于砍劈。骑士们可以随自己爱好，使用钉头锤或战斧，但禁止使用匕首。参战者被打下马背，可以在地上与处于同样不利状态的对手继续战斗，但骑在马上的人这时不得向他发起攻击。任何骑士只要把对方逼到场子一端，使他的身体或武器碰到栅栏，这个对手便必须承认自己输了，他的盔甲和战马便得听任胜利者处置。一个这样被打败的骑士，不准继续参加战斗。任何战斗者被打落马以后，不能重新站起的，他的扈从或侍仆可以进入场内，将他们的主人扶出人群；但在这种情况下，该骑士便应裁定为战败者，他的武器和战马均应没收。在约翰亲王掷下他的指挥棒或权杖后，战斗便得立即停止——这是通常采取的又一防范措施，以免激烈的对抗拖得时间太长，引起不必要的流血。任何骑士违反了比武规则，或者在其他方面背离了骑士的光荣准则，应被解除武装，并把他的盾牌倒置在栅栏的木柱上示众，供人们嘲笑，这是对不符合骑士身分的行为的惩罚。在宣布了这些纪律之后，典礼官便告诫骑士们应恪守本分，以赢得爱和美的女王的恩宠。</p> 
<p>宣讲完毕，典礼官们随即退回了各自的位置。接着，骑士们分别从两头的栅栏外鱼贯入场，排成两行，双方相对站立，每一边的带头人站在前排的中央，但他必须等自己的队伍排列整齐，每人都到位之后，才得进入那个位置。</p> 
<p>这真是蔚为大观、引人入胜的场面，那么多英姿飒爽的勇士全身披挂，作好了进行一场生死搏斗的准备，昂首挺胸骑在马上一动不动，仿佛一根根铁的柱子；那些雄壮的战马也喷着鼻息，用蹄子刨着泥土，似乎已等得不耐烦了；但等一声令下，这些人和马便会同样奋不顾身地投入战斗。</p> 
<p>然而目前，骑士们的长枪还直举着，明亮的枪尖朝着太阳，装饰在长枪上的飘带在帽盔的翎毛上空飞舞。双方排好队伍之后，警卫督察便对他们进行最严格的检查，不让任何一方比规定的人数多一个或少一个。计数准确无误之后，督察们退出了场子，于是威廉·怀维尔以雷鸣般的嗓音宣布了号令：“开始！”话声刚落，号角顿时吹响了，战士们纷纷降下长枪，平举在手中，踢马刺迅速击打着马腹，于是前排的人马风驰电掣般冲向对方，两队人以排山倒海之势在场子中央相遇，发出了震耳欲聋的响声，连一英里外也能听到。对方的后排则以较慢的速度前进，以便支援战败者，或接应各自的战胜者。</p> 
<p>交锋的结果不是一下子就能看清楚的；因为这么多战马扬起的尘士这没了一切，焦急的观众必须等一会才知道冲突的结局。当战斗可以看清时，双方已有一半骑士落下了马背——有的是由于对方的长枪来得太快，招架不住；有的则由于双方力量悬殊，无法抵挡，以致人仰马翻；有的人直挺挺躺在地上，好像再也爬不起来；有的则已站了起来，正与对方处在同样困境的人展开肉搏；两边都有一些人负了伤，不能再打，正在用围巾包扎伤口，设法从混乱的人群中脱身。还在马上的骑士也因猛烈的冲击，长枪几乎全在交锋中折断了，现在只得拔出刀剑进行拚搏，一边呐喊，一边厮打，仿佛他们的荣誉和生命全在此一举。</p> 
<p>双方的第二排人马作为后备力量，现在冲上前来，支援各自的伙伴，他们的加入使局面变得更加混乱了。布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔的追随者在大喊：“杀啊，为了圣殿，为了圣殿！黑白旗万岁！黑白旗万岁！(注1)”对方喊的则是“Desdichado！De sdichado！”(注2)——他们的领袖盾牌上的题词。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注1)圣殿骑士团的旗帜由黑白两色组成，称为“黑白旗”。据说白色是表示它要以仁慈和真诚对待基督徒，黑色是表示要以无情和残忍对待异教徒。——原注</p> 
<p>(注2)这是西班牙文，意即“剥夺继承权的”，见前第八章。</p> 
<p>这样，所有的斗士都以雷霆万钧之势压向对方，双方互有胜负，随着一方或另一方的占据优势，争战的人流有时涌向场子的南端，有时涌向北端。与此同时，武器的碰击声和战斗的呐喊声，与军号声汇成一片可怕的声浪，湮没了落地者的呻吟声，这些人无计可施地在马蹄下翻滚。对阵者的华丽盔甲已给尘垢和血渍弄得面目全非，在刀剑和战斧的击打下变得伤痕累累。鲜艳的羽饰在刀枪的削剪下纷纷脱离盔顶，变成了一簇簇随风飘舞的雪花。作战装备中一切美观的、光辉的东酉都消失了，剩下的只是一片狼藉，理应唤起人们的恐怖或怜悯。</p> 
<p>然而习惯的力量却不是这样，不仅庸俗的观众天然会被骇人的事物所吸引，即使高贵的夫人小姐们拥挤在看台上，也对这场厮杀既惊又喜，看得津津有味，谁也不想把眼睛从惊险万状的场面上移开。确实，不时会有一张漂亮的脸蛋吓得发白，不时会听到一两声轻微的尖叫，但这只是一个情人、兄弟或丈夫给打落马背才引起的反应。总的说来，所有这些妇女都在鼓励流血，她们不仅拍手叫好，也不仅挥舞手帕或面纱，每逢看到成功的刺杀或砍击还会大声呼叫：“棒极了，勇敢的枪手！多好的剑法！”</p> 
<p>对这种血腥的游戏，女性的兴趣既然如此之大，那么男人如何起劲就可想而知了。这表现在每逢双方形势发生变化，场内便会爆发出震天动地的欢呼上，这时所有的眼睛都紧紧盯住了场子，情绪如此热烈，仿佛每一次交手，每一个打击，都是观众自己在进行。在喧嚷的间隙中，还能听到典礼官在喊叫；“勇敢的骑士们，继续战斗！人可以死，但荣誉是永存的！加劲战斗啊，战死比战败更光荣！战斗啊，勇敢的骑士们！美丽的眼睛在注视着你们的成绩！”</p> 
<p>在倏忽万变的战斗中，每个人的眼睛都尽力跟踪着双方的带队人，只见他们夹杂在交战的人群中，正用声音和行动鼓舞着他们的同伴。两人都表现了无比高强的武艺，不论布瓦吉贝尔还是剥夺继承权的骑士，都不能在对方的队伍中找到一个称得上旗鼓相当的敌手。他们在相互的仇恨驱策下，一再寻找着两人单独交手的机会；他们明白，两人中任何一人的落马，都意味着另一方的取得胜利。然而在这种人数众多的混战中，他们企图正面接触的努力起先却无从实现，因为他们的每个追随者都争先恐后，要找对方的首领较量，为自己争取荣誉，以致一再把两人隔开。</p> 
<p>但是双方的人数逐渐减少，有的承认战败退出了，有的被逼到场子一头，或者由于其他原因不能再继续战斗，这样，圣殿骑士和剥夺继承权的骑士终于面对面接触了；誓不两立的仇恨和争夺荣誉的决心，使他们变得凶猛异常，每人的招架和攻击都精彩纷呈，赢得了观众的普遍赞赏和情不自禁的一致喝采。</p> 
<p>然而就在这时，剥夺继承权的骑士一方面临了最不利的处境；虎背熊腰的牛面将军从一边，力大无穷的阿特尔斯坦从另一边正向前猛攻，竭力驱散挡在他们面前的人。他们看到，他们几乎同时扫除了这些敌人，可以抽出身来帮助圣殿骑士与对方搏斗，从而为自己一边赢得决定性的胜利了，于是立即掉转马头，从左右两边直扑剥夺继承权的骑士。这种力量悬殊、出其不意的突然袭击，会使任何人都招架不住；幸好这时观众席上发出的一片呐喊起了警告作用，因为他们对这样的惊险场面是不能不感到兴奋的。</p> 
<p>“当心！当心！剥夺继承权的骑士！”这一迭连声的喊叫使那位骑士意识到了面临的危险，于是他向圣殿骑士猛然一击，随即勒住马缰后退一步，避开了阿特尔斯坦和牛面将军的袭击。这两个骑士却由于攻击的目标已逃之夭夭，扑了个空，冲进了他们的目标和圣殿骑士之间，差点使两匹马迎面相撞，幸好它们给及时勒住了。、然而他们拉住马后，立即掉转了马头，于是三人一起对剥夺继承权的骑士展开了围攻，似乎非把他打翻在地不可。</p> 
<p>这时已什么都不能挽救他，他的唯一依靠只剩了他前一天赢得的那匹出色的战马，得看它是否强壮有力和动作敏捷了。</p> 
<p>另一方面，对他说来幸运的是，布瓦吉贝尔的马已受了伤，而牛面将军和阿特尔斯坦的马在两位主人的庞大身躯和全套盔甲的压力下，经过这天的连续战斗，已相当累了。这样，剥夺继承权的骑士凭他一身马上功夫，以及那匹机灵敏捷的坐骑，得以在几分钟内始终把剑头对准着三个敌人；他左右旋转，像一只灵活的苍鹰在空中翱翔，以致他的对手无法靠近他，而他一会儿冲向这个，一会儿冲向那个，用他的剑横扫着这些敌人，使他们没有还手的机会。</p> 
<p>但是尽管他的出色武艺，在场子里赢得了一片彩声，大家看得很清楚，他最后还是会败下阵来的。约翰亲王周围的贵人们一致要求他掷下权杖，挽救这么英勇的一个骑士，免得他因寡不敌众而蒙受耻辱。</p> 
<p>“不成，凭良心说我不能这么做！”约翰亲王答道。“这小子隐瞒姓名，把我们的好意邀请不放在眼里，他得了一次奖已经够了，现在应该把机会让给别人了。”但是正当他这么说的时候，一件出人意料的事发生了，它改变了这天的局面。</p> 
<p>在剥夺继承权的骑士一边，有一个勇士穿一身黑盔黑甲，骑一匹黑马，那马也又高又大，显得威武强壮，与骑在它背上的人一样。这骑士的盾牌上什么花纹也没有，他也似乎对比武的事漠不关心，有人攻打他，他便招架一下，既不想乘胜追击，也不主动找任何人厮杀。总之，好像他只是逢场作戏，在场子上看热闹，不是在参加战斗；这种设精打采的作风使观众赠给了他一个雅号：黑甲懒汉。</p> 
<p>但是现在这位武士发现他的领队人处境危急，好像一下子脱胎换骨，丢掉了懒洋洋的习气，把胯下那匹养精蓄锐的坐骑猛然一踢，以迅雷不及掩耳之势冲上前去，口里发出了号声似的吼叫：“Desdichado，救兵来了！”这来得正好，因为正当剥夺继承权的骑士冲向圣殿骑士的时候，今面将军举起了剑，已逼近他的身子；但是剑还没砍下，黑甲骑士的剑已朝他头上打来，它擦过亮晶晶的帽盔，又几乎以同等的力量劈向战马的护面甲，这样，牛面将军落到了地上，而且在这猛然一击下，马和人同样失去了知觉。黑甲懒汉随即掉转马头，奔向科宁斯堡的阿特尔斯坦；由于自己的剑在攻打牛面将军时已经破裂，他从撒克逊胖子手中夺下了战斧，随手一挥，仿佛这是他用惯的武器，把它砍向阿特尔斯坦的盔顶，后者随即不省人事，倒到了地上。这干脆利落的两下子使他赢得了更大的彩声，人们谁也没料到他还有这么一手；可是打完以后，他那副没精打采的神气又恢复了，他若无其事地回到了场子北端，让他的队长自己去跟布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔解决战斗。现在这已不像刚才那么困难。圣殿骑士的马流血过多，在剥夺继承权的骑士的攻击下，终于倒下。布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔滚到了地上，又给马镫缠住，一下子抽不出脚。他的对手跳下马背，在他的头顶挥舞着那把致命的剑，命令他投降。这时，圣殿骑士的危险处境感动了约翰亲王，不像他的对手那么得不到理睬，亲王扔下了他的权杖，宣告比武结束，让圣殿骑士避免了承认战败的耻辱。</p> 
<p>不过战斗确实已奄奄一息，难以为继了，因为场内只剩了不多几个骑士，大部分人早已不约而同地退出战斗，听任两位队长自己去一决雌雄了。</p> 
<p>双方的扈从们觉得，在他们的主人打得难分难解的时候回答场子，是一件既危险又困难的事，现在战斗结束，他们才汇集到场内，以便行使职责，照料受伤的人，小心翼翼地把他们送往邻近的帐篷，或者设在附近村子里的急救站。</p> 
<p>阿什贝的这一次难忘的战斗就这么结束了，这是当时竞争最激烈的比武大会之一，因为尽管只有四个骑士当场身亡，其中一人还是由于盔甲过于闷热窒息致死的，然而受重伤的却多达三十人，其中四、五个人再也没有复原，还有更多的人造成了终生残疾，哪怕最幸运的，身上也一辈子留下了战斗的痕迹。因此在历史的记载中，总是把它称作“高尚豪迈、轰动一时的阿什贝比武”。</p> 
<p>现在约翰亲王的责任便是评出一位最佳骑士，他决定把这荣誉授予群众称为“黑甲懒汉”的那个勇士。不过有人对他的裁决不以为然，向他指出，胜利事实上是剥夺继承权的骑士赢得的，他在这场比赛中，一个人打败了六名武士，最后还把对方的队长从马背上打到了地下。但是亲王固执己见，理由是剥夺继承权的骑士和他这队人，要是得不到黑甲骑士的有力支援，便会功败垂成，因此奖赏理应给予这人。</p> 
<p>然而令全场的人大惑不解的是，这位受到青睐的骑士已不知去向。他在战斗结束后，立即离开了比武场。有几个观众曾看到他走进了树林中的一片空地，步子仍那么慢条斯理、没精打采，神色懒洋洋的，与他那个黑甲懒汉的雅号完全一致。在两遍号声和典礼官的重复宣布之后、仍不见他的踪影，于是只得为赋予他的荣誉另外物色人选。现在约翰亲王已找不到借口，无法拒绝把这权利给予剥夺继承权的骑士，这样，他成了这天的优胜者。</p> 
<p>警卫督察们再一次带着优胜者，穿过遍地是滑溜溜的鲜血，一堆堆破碎的盔甲和一匹匹打死或打伤的战马的比武场，来到了约翰亲王的看台下面。</p> 
<p>“剥夺继承权的骑士，”约翰亲王说，“由于你不让我们知道你的名字，我们只得这么称呼你，并再一次把这次比武的优胜者的荣誉授予你，宣布你有权从爱与美的女王手中，接受表彰你的勇敢的桂冠。”</p> 
<p>骑士深深鞠躬表示感谢，但没有作出任何回答。</p> 
<p>在号声再度吹响，典礼官拉开嗓门，向勇敢而光荣的优胜者大声祝贺时，在女士们纷纷挥动丝手帕和绣花面纱，全场观众兴高采烈，发出惊天动地的欢呼时，警卫督察们领着剥夺继承权的骑士穿过场子，来到了罗文娜小姐今天占有的那个荣誉座位脚下。</p> 
<p>优胜者给搀扶着，在看台下较低一级梯子前跪下。确实，从战斗结束起，他的全部行动仿佛都是听任周围人的摆布，不是按自己的意愿行事；而且不难看到，他第二次给带着穿过比武场时，他的脚步摇摇晃晃的。罗文娜迈着优美而庄重的步子走下看台，正要把拿在手中的桂冠套在勇士的帽盔上，两位警卫督察却一致喊道：“这样不成，必须脱下帽盔。”骑士小声嘟哝了一句什么，可是隔着脸甲听不清楚，它的主要意思似乎是要求别把他的头盔摘下。</p> 
<p>不知是出于对礼节的尊重还是好奇心，警卫督察没有理会他的反对表示，随手割断了头盔的带子，替他脱下了帽盔，解开了护喉甲。帽盔取下后，一张容貌端正、但晒得黑黑的脸便露了出来；可以看出，这是一个二十五岁的年轻人，披着一头剪短的金黄色头发，面色死一般的苍白，脸上还留着一两条血迹。</p> 
<p>罗文娜一看到他，便发出了一声轻轻的尖叫，但立刻鼓起勇气，恢复了镇静，仿佛在迫使自己继续履行职责，可是她的身体由于感情的激动仍在哆嗦；她把标志着今天的奖赏的华丽桂冠，戴到了优胜者低垂的头上，用清脆而明晰的声音宣布了这些话：“我赐予你这顶桂冠，骑士先生，作为对今天的优胜者的英勇行为的回报。” 说到这里，她停了一下，然后又坚定地加了一句：“还从没一个骑士更配得上戴这顶桂冠的！”</p> 
<p>骑士俯下头，吻了可爱的女王的手，表示了对她的奖励的感谢；然而就在这时，他突然向前扑倒，躺在她的脚边不动了。</p> 
<p>场上顿时一片惊慌。塞德里克看到被驱逐的儿子突然出现，诧异得目瞪口呆，现在冲到前面，似乎要把罗文娜与他分开。但是警卫督察已这么做了，他们猜到了他昏倒的原因，赶紧解开他的盔甲，发现一个枪头穿透他的胸铠，刺伤了他的肋骨。</p>
