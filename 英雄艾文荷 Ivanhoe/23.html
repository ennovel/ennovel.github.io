Orra, a Tragedy</p> 
<p>While these measures were taking in behalf of Cedric and his companions, the armed men by whom the latter had been seized, hurried their captives along towards the place of security, where they intended to imprison them. But darkness came on fast, and the paths of the wood seemed but imperfectly known to the marauders. They were compelled to make several long halts, and once or twice to return on their road to resume the direction which they wished to pursue. The summer morn had dawned upon them ere they could travel in full assurance that they held the right path. But confidence returned with light, and the cavalcade now moved rapidly forward. Meanwhile, the following dialogue took place between the two leaders of the banditti.</p> 
<p>"It is time thou shouldst leave us, Sir Maurice," said the Templar to De Bracy, "in order to prepare the second part of thy mystery. Thou art next, thou knowest, to act the Knight Deliverer."</p> 
<p>"I have thought better of it," said De Bracy; "I will not leave thee till the prize is fairly deposited in Front-de-Boeuf's castle. There will I appear before the Lady Rowena in mine own shape, and trust that she will set down to the vehemence of my passion the violence of which I have been guilty."</p> 
<p>"And what has made thee change thy plan, De Bracy?" replied the Knight Templar.</p> 
<p>"That concerns thee nothing," answered his companion.</p> 
<p>"I would hope, however, Sir Knight," said the Templar, "that this alteration of measures arises from no suspicion of my honourable meaning, such as Fitzurse endeavoured to instil into thee?"</p> 
<p>"My thoughts are my own," answered De Bracy; "the fiend laughs, they say, when one thief robs another; and we know, that were he to spit fire and brimstone instead, it would never prevent a Templar from following his bent."</p> 
<p>"Or the leader of a Free Company," answered the Templar, "from dreading at the hands of a comrade and friend, the injustice he does to all mankind."</p> 
<p>"This is unprofitable and perilous recrimination," answered De Bracy; "suffice it to say, I know the morals of the Temple-Order, and I will not give thee the power of cheating me out of the fair prey for which I have run such risks."</p> 
<p>"Psha," replied the Templar, "what hast thou to fear?---Thou knowest the vows of our order."</p> 
<p>"Right well," said De Bracy, "and also how they are kept. Come, Sir Templar, the laws of gallantry have a liberal interpretation in Palestine, and this is a case in which I will trust nothing to your conscience."</p> 
<p>"Hear the truth, then," said the Templar; "I care not for your blue-eyed beauty. There is in that train one who will make me a better mate."</p> 
<p>"What! wouldst thou stoop to the waiting damsel?" said De Bracy.</p> 
<p>"No, Sir Knight," said the Templar, haughtily. "To the waiting-woman will I not stoop. I have a prize among the captives as lovely as thine own."</p> 
<p>"By the mass, thou meanest the fair Jewess!" said De Bracy.</p> 
<p>"And if I do," said Bois-Guilbert, "who shall gainsay me?"</p> 
<p>"No one that I know," said De Bracy, "unless it be your vow of celibacy, or a cheek of conscience for an intrigue with a Jewess."</p> 
<p>"For my vow," said the Templar, "our Grand Master hath granted me a dispensation. And for my conscience, a man that has slain three hundred Saracens, need not reckon up every little failing, like a village girl at her first confession upon Good Friday eve."</p> 
<p>"Thou knowest best thine own privileges," said De Bracy. "Yet, I would have sworn thy thought had been more on the old usurer's money bags, than on the black eyes of the daughter."</p> 
<p>"I can admire both," answered the Templar; "besides, the old Jew is but half-prize. I must share his spoils with Front-de-Boeuf, who will not lend us the use of his castle for nothing. I must have something that I can term exclusively my own by this foray of ours, and I have fixed on the lovely Jewess as my peculiar prize. But, now thou knowest my drift, thou wilt resume thine own original plan, wilt thou not?---Thou hast nothing, thou seest, to fear from my interference."</p> 
<p>"No," replied De Bracy, "I will remain beside my prize. What thou sayst is passing true, but I like not the privileges acquired by the dispensation of the Grand Master, and the merit acquired by the slaughter of three hundred Saracens. You have too good a right to a free pardon, to render you very scrupulous about peccadilloes."</p> 
<p>While this dialogue was proceeding, Cedric was endeavouring to wring out of those who guarded him an avowal of their character and purpose. "You should be Englishmen," said he; "and yet, sacred Heaven! you prey upon your countrymen as if you were very Normans. You should be my neighbours, and, if so, my friends; for which of my English neighbours have reason to be otherwise? I tell ye, yeomen, that even those among ye who have been branded with outlawry have had from me protection; for I have pitied their miseries, and curst the oppression of their tyrannic nobles. What, then, would you have of me? or in what can this violence serve ye?---Ye are worse than brute beasts in your actions, and will you imitate them in their very dumbness?"</p> 
<p>It was in vain that Cedric expostulated with his guards, who had too many good reasons for their silence to be induced to break it either by his wrath or his expostulations. They continued to hurry him along, travelling at a very rapid rate, until, at the end of an avenue of huge trees, arose Torquilstone, now the hoary and ancient castle of Reginald Front-de-Boeuf. It was a fortress of no great size, consisting of a donjon, or large and high square tower, surrounded by buildings of inferior height, which were encircled by an inner court-yard. Around the exterior wall was a deep moat, supplied with water from a neighbouring rivulet. Front-de-Boeuf, whose character placed him often at feud with his enemies, had made considerable additions to the strength of his castle, by building towers upon the outward wall, so as to flank it at every angle. The access, as usual in castles of the period, lay through an arched barbican, or outwork, which was terminated and defended by a small turret at each corner.</p> 
<p>Cedric no sooner saw the turrets of Front-de-Boeuf's castle raise their grey and moss-grown battlements, glimmering in the morning sun above the wood by which they were surrounded, than he instantly augured more truly concerning the cause of his misfortune.</p> 
<p>"I did injustice," he said, "to the thieves and outlaws of these woods, when I supposed such banditti to belong to their bands; I might as justly have confounded the foxes of these brakes with the ravening wolves of France. Tell me, dogs---is it my life or my wealth that your master aims at? Is it too much that two Saxons, myself and the noble Athelstane, should hold land in the country which was once the patrimony of our race?---Put us then to death, and complete your tyranny by taking our lives, as you began with our liberties. If the Saxon Cedric cannot rescue England, he is willing to die for her. Tell your tyrannical master, I do only beseech him to dismiss the Lady Rowena in honour and safety. She is a woman, and he need not dread her; and with us will die all who dare fight in her cause."</p> 
<p>The attendants remained as mute to this address as to the former, and they now stood before the gate of the castle. De Bracy winded his horn three times, and the archers and cross-bow men, who had manned the wall upon seeing their approach, hastened to lower the drawbridge, and admit them. The prisoners were compelled by their guards to alight, and were conducted to an apartment where a hasty repast was offered them, of which none but Athelstane felt any inclination to partake. Neither had the descendant of the Confessor much time to do justice to the good cheer placed before them, for their guards gave him and Cedric to understand that they were to be imprisoned in a chamber apart from Rowena. Resistance was vain; and they were compelled to follow to a large room, which, rising on clumsy Saxon pillars, resembled those refectories and chapter-houses which may be still seen in the most ancient parts of our most ancient monasteries.</p> 
<p>The Lady Rowena was next separated from her train, and conducted, with courtesy, indeed, but still without consulting her inclination, to a distant apartment. The same alarming distinction was conferred on Rebecca, in spite of her father's entreaties, who offered even money, in this extremity of distress, that she might be permitted to abide with him. "Base unbeliever," answered one of his guards, "when thou hast seen thy lair, thou wilt not wish thy daughter to partake it." And, without farther discussion, the old Jew was forcibly dragged off in a different direction from the other prisoners. The domestics, after being carefully searched and disarmed, were confined in another part of the castle; and Rowena was refused even the comfort she might have derived from the attendance of her handmaiden Elgitha.</p> 
<p>The apartment in which the Saxon chiefs were confined, for to them we turn our first attention, although at present used as a sort of guard-room, had formerly been the great hall of the castle. It was now abandoned to meaner purposes, because the present lord, among other additions to the convenience, security, and beauty of his baronial residence, had erected a new and noble hall, whose vaulted roof was supported by lighter and more elegant pillars, and fitted up with that higher degree of ornament, which the Normans had already introduced into architecture.</p> 
<p>Cedric paced the apartment, filled with indignant reflections on the past and on the present, while the apathy of his companion served, instead of patience and philosophy, to defend him against every thing save the inconvenience of the present moment; and so little did he feel even this last, that he was only from time to time roused to a reply by Cedric's animated and impassioned appeal to him.</p> 
<p>"Yes," said Cedric, half speaking to himself, and half addressing himself to Athelstane, "it was in this very hall that my father feasted with Torquil Wolfganger, when he entertained the valiant and unfortunate Harold, then advancing against the Norwegians, who had united themselves to the rebel Tosti. It was in this hall that Harold returned the magnanimous answer to the ambassador of his rebel brother. Oft have I heard my father kindle as he told the tale. The envoy of Tosti was admitted, when this ample room could scarce contain the crowd of noble Saxon leaders, who were quaffing the blood-red wine around their monarch."</p> 
<p>"I hope," said Athelstane, somewhat moved by this part of his friend's discourse, "they will not forget to send us some wine and refactions at noon---we had scarce a breathing-space allowed to break our fast, and I never have the benefit of my food when I eat immediately after dismounting from horseback, though the leeches recommend that practice."</p> 
<p>Cedric went on with his story without noticing this interjectional observation of his friend.</p> 
<p>"The envoy of Tosti," he said, "moved up the hall, undismayed by the frowning countenances of all around him, until he made his obeisance before the throne of King Harold.</p> 
<p>"'What terms,' he said, 'Lord King, hath thy brother Tosti to hope, if he should lay down his arms, and crave peace at thy hands?'</p> 
<p>"'A brother's love,' cried the generous Harold, 'and the fair earldom of Northumberland.'</p> 
<p>"'But should Tosti accept these terms,' continued the envoy, 'what lands shall be assigned to his faithful ally, Hardrada, King of Norway?'</p> 
<p>"'Seven feet of English ground,' answered Harold, fiercely, 'or, as Hardrada is said to be a giant, perhaps we may allow him twelve inches more.'</p> 
<p>"The hall rung with acclamations, and cup and horn was filled to the Norwegian, who should be speedily in possession of his English territory."</p> 
<p>"I could have pledged him with all my soul," said Athelstane, "for my tongue cleaves to my palate."</p> 
<p>"The baffled envoy," continued Cedric, pursuing with animation his tale, though it interested not the listener, "retreated, to carry to Tosti and his ally the ominous answer of his injured brother. It was then that the distant towers of York, and the bloody streams of the Derwent,*</p> 
<p>* Note D. Battle of Stamford.</p> 
<p>beheld that direful conflict, in which, after displaying the most undaunted valour, the King of Norway, and Tosti, both fell, with ten thousand of their bravest followers. Who would have thought that upon the proud day when this battle was won, the very gale which waved the Saxon banners in triumph, was filling the Norman sails, and impelling them to the fatal shores of Sussex?---Who would have thought that Harold, within a few brief days, would himself possess no more of his kingdom, than the share which he allotted in his wrath to the Norwegian invader? ---Who would have thought that you, noble Athelstane---that you, descended of Harold's blood, and that I, whose father was not the worst defender of the Saxon crown, should be prisoners to a vile Norman, in the very hall in which our ancestors held such high festival?"</p> 
<p>"It is sad enough," replied Athelstane; "but I trust they will hold us to a moderate ransom---At any rate it cannot be their purpose to starve us outright; and yet, although it is high noon, I see no preparations for serving dinner. Look up at the window, noble Cedric, and judge by the sunbeams if it is not on the verge of noon."</p> 
<p>"It may be so," answered Cedric; "but I cannot look on that stained lattice without its awakening other reflections than those which concern the passing moment, or its privations. When that window was wrought, my noble friend, our hardy fathers knew not the art of making glass, or of staining it---The pride of Wolfganger's father brought an artist from Normandy to adorn his hall with this new species of emblazonment, that breaks the golden light of God's blessed day into so many fantastic hues. The foreigner came here poor, beggarly, cringing, and subservient, ready to doff his cap to the meanest native of the household. He returned pampered and proud, to tell his rapacious countrymen of the wealth and the simplicity of the Saxon nobles ---a folly, oh, Athelstane, foreboded of old, as well as foreseen, by those descendants of Hengist and his hardy tribes, who retained the simplicity of their manners. We made these strangers our bosom friends, our confidential servants; we borrowed their artists and their arts, and despised the honest simplicity and hardihood with which our brave ancestors supported themselves, and we became enervated by Norman arts long ere we fell under Norman arms. Far better was our homely diet, eaten in peace and liberty, than the luxurious dainties, the love of which hath delivered us as bondsmen to the foreign conqueror!"</p> 
<p>"I should," replied Athelstane, "hold very humble diet a luxury at present; and it astonishes me, noble Cedric, that you can bear so truly in mind the memory of past deeds, when it appeareth you forget the very hour of dinner."</p> 
<p>"It is time lost," muttered Cedric apart and impatiently, "to speak to him of aught else but that which concerns his appetite! The soul of Hardicanute hath taken possession of him, and he hath no pleasure save to fill, to swill, and to call for more. ---Alas!" said he, looking at Athelstane with compassion, "that so dull a spirit should be lodged in so goodly a form! Alas! that such an enterprise as the regeneration of England should turn on a hinge so imperfect! Wedded to Rowena, indeed, her nobler and more generous soul may yet awake the better nature which is torpid within him. Yet how should this be, while Rowena, Athelstane, and I myself, remain the prisoners of this brutal marauder and have been made so perhaps from a sense of the dangers which our liberty might bring to the usurped power of his nation?"</p> 
<p>While the Saxon was plunged in these painful reflections, the door of their prison opened, and gave entrance to a sewer, holding his white rod of office. This important person advanced into the chamber with a grave pace, followed by four attendants, bearing in a table covered with dishes, the sight and smell of which seemed to be an instant compensation to Athelstane for all the inconvenience he had undergone. The persons who attended on the feast were masked and cloaked.</p> 
<p>"What mummery is this?" said Cedric; "think you that we are ignorant whose prisoners we are, when we are in the castle of your master? Tell him," he continued, willing to use this opportunity to open a negotiation for his freedom,---"Tell your master, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf, that we know no reason he can have for withholding our liberty, excepting his unlawful desire to enrich himself at our expense. Tell him that we yield to his rapacity, as in similar circumstances we should do to that of a literal robber. Let him name the ransom at which he rates our liberty, and it shall be paid, providing the exaction is suited to our means." The sewer made no answer, but bowed his head.</p> 
<p>"And tell Sir Reginald Front-de-Boeuf," said Athelstane, "that I send him my mortal defiance, and challenge him to combat with me, on foot or horseback, at any secure place, within eight days after our liberation; which, if he be a true knight, he will not, under these circumstances, venture to refuse or to delay."</p> 
<p>"I shall deliver to the knight your defiance," answered the sewer; "meanwhile I leave you to your food."</p> 
<p>The challenge of Athelstane was delivered with no good grace; for a large mouthful, which required the exercise of both jaws at once, added to a natural hesitation, considerably damped the effect of the bold defiance it contained. Still, however, his speech was hailed by Cedric as an incontestible token of reviving spirit in his companion, whose previous indifference had begun, notwithstanding his respect for Athelstane's descent, to wear out his patience. But he now cordially shook hands with him in token of his approbation, and was somewhat grieved when Athelstane observed, "that he would fight a dozen such men as Front-de-Boeuf, if, by so doing, he could hasten his departure from a dungeon where they put so much garlic into their pottage." Notwithstanding this intimation of a relapse into the apathy of sensuality, Cedric placed himself opposite to Athelstane, and soon showed, that if the distresses of his country could banish the recollection of food while the table was uncovered, yet no sooner were the victuals put there, than he proved that the appetite of his Saxon ancestors had descended to him along with their other qualities.</p> 
<p>The captives had not long enjoyed their refreshment, however, ere their attention was disturbed even from this most serious occupation by the blast of a horn winded before the gate. It was repeated three times, with as much violence as if it had been blown before an enchanted castle by the destined knight, at whose summons halls and towers, barbican and battlement, were to roll off like a morning vapour. The Saxons started from the table, and hastened to the window. But their curiosity was disappointed; for these outlets only looked upon the court of the castle, and the sound came from beyond its precincts. The summons, however, seemed of importance, for a considerable degree of bustle instantly took place in the castle.</p>

<p>啊，自从人们围坐在这张桌边，</p> 
<p>自从灯烛照亮这个桌面以来，</p> 
<p>已经历了多少漫长的岁月！</p> 
<p>可是远古的声音仿佛还萦绕在我们耳边，</p> 
<p>还在这些阴暗空虚的拱顶四周回旋，</p> 
<p>似乎那些早已安息在坟墓中的人，</p> 
<p>仍在这儿流速徘徊，窃窃低语。</p> 
<p>《奥拉，一出悲剧》</p> 
<p>就在为营救塞德里克等人进行紧张的准备时，绑架他们的武装歹徒正把他们送往预定的囚禁地点。但是夜色越来越浓，这伙强人似乎不太熟悉森林中的路径。他们不得不一再停顿，这花了不少时间，有一两次还只得退回原处，辨别应走的方向。夏季天亮得早，曙光初露时，他们还不能完全确定，他们走的路线是不是正确。但是天色明亮以后，信心便恢复了，他们也得以迅速向前趱行。这时在强盗的两个领导人之间，进行了下面的谈话：</p> 
<p>“现在你可以走了，莫里斯爵士，”圣殿骑士对德布拉西说，“你该去准备这次秘密行动的第二部分了。你知道，下一步你该扮演救星骑士了。”</p> 
<p>“我改变主意了，”德布拉西说，“我得等我的美人在牛面将军的城堡中安置妥当以后，才离开你。到了那里，我便得以我的本来面目出现在罗文娜小姐面前，我相信我的热情会感动她，使她谅解我在这次暴力行动中的过错。”</p> 
<p>“你改变计划的原因是什么，德布拉西？”圣殿骑士问。</p> 
<p>“那与你无关，”他的朋友答道。</p> 
<p>“但是我希望，骑士阁下，你改变主意不是对我的正直意图产生了怀疑．菲泽西不是曾竭力向你灌输这种想法吗？”</p> 
<p>“我的想法是我自己的，”德布拉西答道。“人们说，一个强盗掠夺另一个强盗的时候，魔鬼也会放声大笑；但我们知道，哪怕他嘴里喷出的是硫磺火焰，也不能阻止圣殿骑士随心所欲的胡来。”</p> 
<p>“这是说，自由团队的领导人也怕遭到一个同伴和朋友的算计，”圣殿骑士答道，“尽管他自己天天都在算计别人。”</p> 
<p>“你对我反咬一口是没有道理的，也是危险的，”德布拉西答道。“你得明白，我知道圣殿骑士团的信誉，我不会给你机会，让你把我冒了这么大的危险获得的美女骗走。”</p> 
<p>“真是胡言乱语，”圣殿骑士说道，“你有什么可担心的？你知道我们骑士全团的誓言。”</p> 
<p>“一点不错，”德布拉酉说，“还知道你们怎么遵守诺言。得啦，圣殿骑士阁下，骑士的侠义守则在巴勒斯坦是可以随意解释的；在这一点上，我不能相信你的良心。”</p> 
<p>“那么实话对你说吧，”圣殿骑士道，“我对你的蓝眼睛美人不感兴趣。那伙人中另外有一个姑娘更符合我的心意。”</p> 
<p>“什么！你竟然愿意要那个使女？”德布拉西说。</p> 
<p>“不，骑士阁下，”圣殿骑士傲慢地说。“我当然不会要那个使女。我看中的那个人，在俘虏中与你的一样可爱。”</p> 
<p>“我的天哪，你是指那个漂亮的犹太姑娘！”德布拉西说。</p> 
<p>“只要我愿意，”布瓦吉贝尔说，“谁敢反对？”</p> 
<p>“谁也不会反对，”德布拉西说，“除非你的独身誓言，或者你的良知不允许你与一个犹太姑娘私通。”</p> 
<p>“说到我的誓言，”圣殿骑士道，“我已得到我们大宗师的特许，可以不受约束。至于良知，一个杀死过三百名萨拉森人的勇士，不需要考虑每一个小过大，他不是乡下姑娘，不会在耶稣受难日前夕的第一次忏悔中把什么都当作罪孽。”</p> 
<p>“当然，你的权利，你自己最清楚，”德布拉西说。“不过，我可以起誓，你想得到的主要是那个老守财奴的钱袋，不是那个黑眼睛的女儿。”</p> 
<p>“我两者都要，”圣殿骑士答道。“再说，那个犹太佬我只能得到一半我不得不与牛面将军平分他的财产，他捞不到好处，不会把他的城堡借给我们。在这次抢劫活动中，我必须得到一件我可以独自占有的东西，我便把这个犹太小妞儿看作我的特殊战利品。现在你知道了我的意图，你可以按照你原来的计划行事了，是不是？你瞧，你根本不用担心我会抢走你的心上人。”</p> 
<p>“不，”德布拉西答道，“我得留在我的美人身边。你这番话也许是真的，但我不喜欢你从你的大宗师那里得到的特权，也不喜欢你从杀戮三百名萨拉森人取得的功绩。你既然享有特权，可以随时获得宽恕，你就不会把那些小过失放在心上了。”</p> 
<p>这场谈话进行时，塞德里克正跟押送他的人套交情，指望从他们口中了解他们是何许人，什么意图。“你们应该是英国人，”他说，“然而，我的天呐！你们却要陷害你们的同胞，好像你们是诺曼人似的。你们应该都是我的邻居，因而也是我的朋友；因为凡是我的邻居，都应该是我的朋友，怎么会不是这样呢？告诉你们，老乡们，哪怕你们中间那些曾被栽上土匪罪名的人，也得到过我的保护；因为我同情他们的苦难，诅咒专横的贵族对他们的压迫。那么你们还要我怎么样？这种暴力行动又能使你们得到什么呢？你们干的事比野兽还不如，难道你们要学它们当哑巴不成？”</p> 
<p>塞德里克的劝告，对押送他的人毫无作用，他们有太多的理由需要保持沉默，因此不论他发怒也好，讲好话也好，他们反正不开门，只是一个劲地催他快走。这样，他们加速前进，最后来到了一条林荫道上，它的两旁尽是高大的树木，牛面将军雷金纳德的托奎尔斯通城堡，便矗立在它的末端，它历史悠久，已相当古老了。这本来是一个不大的堡垒，包括个上楼，即又高又大的方形塔楼，周围的建筑较低，这些房屋都位在一个内院的中央、沿着外面的围墙有一条深深的壕沟，水是从附近的一条小河引入的。牛面将军的性格使他与他的敌人时常争吵，因此他又增添了不少建筑，加强城堡的防御力量，在外面的围墙上造了一些塔楼，可以从每个犄角上掩护它的侧翼。入口与当时的一般城堡相仿，得穿过一个拱形碉楼或外堡，它外面每个角上都有一个小塔楼保卫它。</p> 
<p>塞德里克一眼望去，看到了牛面将军城堡中那些小塔楼上长满青苔的灰色雉堞，它们正闪闪烁烁，沐浴在周围树林上空的一片晨光中，于是他立刻明白了，对这次灾难的原因有了较清醒的认识。</p> 
<p>“我错怪了这些树林中的强人和盗匪了，”他说，“我还以为绑架我们的是这些人呢。我真糊涂，把法国来的吃人豺狼跟本地的狐狸混为一谈了。告诉我，你们这些畜生，你们是要我的性命或者我的财产吧？这个国家个来世世代代属于我们撒克逊人．现在我和阿特尔斯坦这两个撒克逊人，八这儿享有我们的土地，难道不应该吗？那么处死我们吧，你们先是剥夺我们的自由，现在又想剥夺我们的生命，这样，你们的暴政就功德圆满了。如果撒克逊人塞德里克不能拯救英国，他愿意为它而死。告诉你们专横的主人，我对他只有一个要求，那就是让罗文娜小姐获得光荣而安全的自由。她是妇女，他用不到怕她，我们一死就再没有人会为她战斗了。”</p> 
<p>这一席话，那些仆从听了照旧一声不吭。现在他们已站在城堡的大门前，德布拉西吹了三遍号角；弓弩手们看到他们走近，本来已在城堡上严阵以待，这时赶紧放下了吊桥，让他们入内。俘虏们给押送人员叫下了马，带进一间屋子，还匆匆忙忙给他们端来了一些食物，但是除了阿特尔斯坦，谁也没有心思吃饭。不过忏悔者(注)的这位后裔对放在他面前的菜肴，也没有太多的时间享受，因为押送人员随即通知他和塞德里克，他们得与罗文娜分开，单独禁闭在一间屋子中。反抗是没有用的，他们给送进一了一间大房间，那里的柱子又粗又大，这种撒克逊建筑有些像老式的食堂和礼堂，在我们最古老的修道院中还能见到。</p>

<p>接着，罗文娜小姐也给隔离了，那是很远的一间屋子；确实，她是被客客气请去的，但不论怎么说，没有征求过她的同意。丽贝卡也得到了同样人可思议的优越待遇，尽管她的父亲再三恳求，不愿在这危急关头与她分开，甚至答应拿出钱来也没有用。一个押送的人回答他道：“不信基督的混蛋等你看到你的狗岗后，你就不会希望你的女儿也住在那里了。”这样，毫无商量的余地，犹太老人给拽走了，他关的地方与别的俘虏不在同一个方向。他们的家人经过仔细搜查，解除了武装后，都给赶进城堡的另一部分；罗文娜要求让她的贴身使女艾尔占莎留在身边侍候她，也遭到了拒绝。</p> 
<p>我们先来看看那两位撒克逊家长的情形。囚禁他们的那间屋子．现在虽然当作了牢房，从前却是城堡的大厅，只是后来它的地位降低了，因为目前的主人为了舒适、安全和美观．扩建这栋男爵府邸时，盖造了一问新的豪华大厅，它的拱形屋顶是用较细的、精致的柱产支撑的，装磺也比较典雅，表现了诺曼人已在开始采用的富丽堂皇的建筑风格。</p> 
<p>塞德里走在屋里踱来踱去，怒气冲冲地回顾着过去和现在，他那位朋友却垂头丧气．不想进行忍辱负重的哲学思考，提高抵御一切的毅力，只是时眼前的处境觉得不太舒服罢了；其实这种不舒服，他也感受不深，因此对塞德里克声色俱厉、慷慨激昂的诉说，不过偶尔回答一两句。</p> 
<p>“是的，”塞德里克说，又像自言自语，又像是在向阿特尔斯坦讲话，“当年就在这间大厅里，托奎尔·沃尔夫岗格宴请英勇而不幸的哈罗德(注)时，我的祖父也参加了宴会，那时哈罗德正要去攻打挪威人，因为他们支持托斯蒂格的叛乱。就是在这问大厅里，哈罗德对反叛的兄弟的使臣作出了庄严的回答。我的父亲几次谈到过这事．一讲起来便很兴奋。托斯蒂格的使臣进了大厅，当时这间宽敞的屋于几乎挤满了撒克逊的贵族领袖，他们正围着他们的君主，大口喝着血红的葡萄酒。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)即哈罗德二世、1066年1月继爱德华之后为英国国王，这人极有才能，作战英勇、但在位仅数月，便在十月于抵抗诺曼人的黑斯廷斯战役中阵亡,，从而结束了英国的撒克逊王朝。托斯蒂格是他的兄弟，于1066年发动叛乱，挪威国王哈拉尔德三世因觊觎英国王位、支持了托斯蒂格。这年九月、托斯蒂格和哈拉尔德三世均在作战中被哈罗德杀死。</p> 
<p>塞德里克的这部分议论，有些打动他的朋友了，阿特尔斯坦说道：“我希望他们别忘了中午给我们送些酒菜来，刚才那么匆匆忙忙的．我简直没吃一点东西；我平常下马以后不能立刻吃饭，总觉得没有味道，尽管医生认为，骑马以后应该用些食物。”</p> 
<p>塞德里克继续讲他的故事，不去理会他的朋友的这些感触。</p> 
<p>“托斯蒂格的使臣走上大厅，”他说，“看到周围那一张张怒目而视的脸没有气馁、走到哈罗德国王的御座前行了礼。</p> 
<p>“‘陛下，’他说，‘你的兄弟托斯蒂格希望知道，如果他放下武器，向你提议和平，你的条件是什么？’</p> 
<p>“‘我与他恢复手足之情，’宽宏大量的哈罗德答道，‘赐给他富饶的诺森伯兰伯爵领地。’</p> 
<p>“‘但是托斯蒂格接受这些条件的话，’使臣继续道，‘他的忠实盟友挪威国王哈德拉达(注)可以得到什么领地？’</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)即哈拉尔德三世，这是他的浑号，意为“残酷的统治者”。下面的“七英尺土地”指坟墓。</p> 
<p>“‘七英尺英国土地，’哈罗德严厉地回答，‘不过听说哈德拉达生得高大，我也许可以多给他十二英寸。’</p> 
<p>“大厅中响起了一片喝彩声，大大小小的杯子都斟满了酒，祝贺哈德拉达不久就可以得到这片英国领土了。”</p> 
<p>“我也全心全意希望为他祝酒，”阿特尔斯坦说，“我的舌头于得快粘住硬腭了。”</p> 
<p>“碰了钉子的使臣，”塞德里克继续兴致勃勃地讲他的故事，尽管听的人对这事不感兴趣，“只得带着气愤的兄长的这个不祥答复，回去向托斯蒂格和他的盟友复命了。这样，约克郡的遥远塔楼和德文特河才看到了那场血腥的战斗 (注1)，它把河水都染红了，挪威国王和托斯蒂格在表现了最无畏的勇气后，都倒进了血泊中，他们的一万名勇士也死了。谁想得到，在赢得这次战斗的那自豪的一天，吹拂着胜利的撒克逊军旗的那股风，也把诺曼人的战船吹到了苏塞克斯的不幸的海岸上(注2)？谁会想到，短短几天之后，哈罗德便不再拥有他的王国，留给他的只是他在愤怒中许给挪威侵略者的一小块土地？谁又会想到，你，尊贵的阿特尔斯坦，你这个哈罗德血统的后裔，还有我，曾经英勇保卫撒克逊王朝的祖父的子孙，成了一个卑鄙的诺曼人的阶下囚，给关在我们祖先曾举办过庄严的宴会的大厅中？”</p>

<p>(注2)征服者威廉的军队于1066年9月在苏塞克斯一带登陆，随即发生了黑斯廷斯战役。</p> 
<p>“这是相当伤心的，”阿特尔斯坦答道，“但我相信，他们不过是要我们拿出一笔小小的赎金罢了。无论如何，他们不可能是要把我们干脆饿死。不过中午都快到了，还不见他们准备送午饭来。你抬头瞧瞧窗外，尊贵的塞德里克，看看阳光照到哪里了，是不是快到中午了。”</p> 
<p>“大概快到了，”塞德里克答道，“但我看到这些彩色格子玻璃，便不能不想起许多事，不仅仅是眼前这个时刻和没有酒菜等等。当年造这窗子的时候，尊贵的朋友，我们吃苦耐劳的祖先还不会制造玻璃，更不知道彩色玻璃。沃尔夫岗格的父亲自鸣得意．从诺曼底找了个手艺人来，要他用这种新式的彩色玻璃装饰这间大厅，它把上帝赐给我们的明亮阳光，分解成了许多鲜艳的颜色。这个外国人来的时候身无分文，是个穷光蛋，对我们卑躬屈膝，奉承讨好，看到屋里最下贱的仆人也要脱帽致敬。可他回去的时候已经腰缠万贯，一见他那些贪心的本国人，便夸耀撒克逊贵人如何有钱，如何老实可欺——唉，阿特尔斯坦，这实在是不祥之兆，亨吉斯特和他刻苦耐劳的各宗族的后裔，凡是保持着他们艰苦朴素作风的，也无不预见到了。我们把那些外国人当作知心朋友，呵以依赖的仆人，我们请来了他们的工匠，借用了他们的技术，抛弃了我们勇敢的祖先所赖以立身处世的朴素和艰苦的正直作风；在我们被诺曼人的武力征服以前，我们早已给诺曼人的技术腐蚀得弱不禁风了。享用我们本国的食品，过和平而自由的生活，这比为了贪图奢华精致的饮食，使自己沦为外国征服者的奴隶好得多！”</p> 
<p>“好啦，”阿特尔斯坦答道，“现在哪怕粗茶淡饭对我也是豪华的享受了。尊贵的塞德里克，我觉得奇怪，你对过去的事记得一清二楚，对眼前的午饭却好像忘得干干净净了。”’</p> 
<p>“这真是对牛弹琴，”塞德里克有些不耐烦，自言自语道，“跟他讲什么都是白搭，他关心的只是他的肚子！哈迪克努特(注)的灵魂已经占有了他，除了吃喝，不断地吃喝，他什么也不感兴趣。唉，”他看看阿特尔斯坦，露出怜悯的脸色，“这么美好的仪表却包藏着一颗麻木不仁的心灵！唉！振兴英国的大业却要依靠这么一副生锈的饺链来转动！确实，与罗文娜结婚，她更高贵、更丰富的灵魂，还可能唤醒他身上较好的天赋，让它从麻木不仁中脱颖而出。然而怎么做到这点呢，现在罗文娜、阿特尔斯坦和我，都落进了这些粗野的暴徒手中；他们这么做也许就因为意识到，我们的自由对他们篡夺国家权力是一种威胁吧？”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)撒克逊王朝的一个国王，1040—1O42年在位，他暴戾而又贪食，最后是在一次婚宴上大吃大喝胀死的。</p> 
<p>这个撒克逊人沉浸在痛苦的思索中，这时，牢房的门开了，手持白木棍作职权标志的管家走了进来。这个管理膳食的重要人物，迈着庄严的步子走到房间中央后面四个仆人抬着一张放满菜肴的桌子,它们的出现和香味使阿特尔斯坦顿时精神振奋,消除了他对不舒服的一切抱怨。照管饮食的几个人都戴着面罩,穿着长袍。</p> 
<p>“这是玩的什么把戏？”塞德里克说：“你们以为到了你们主人的城堡中，我们还个知道囚禁我们的是谁吗？告诉他，”他继续道，想利用这机会，为他们的释放展开谈判，“告诉你们的主人下面将军雷阵雨金纳德，我们懂得，他剥夺我们的自由，无非想从我们这里非法榨取一笔钱罢了。那么告诉他，我们愿意计步，满足他的贪欲．就像我们遇到真正的强盗，也不得个这么做一样。让他开个价钱，说明需要多少赎余，只要他的勒索符合我们的力量，我们可以照付。”</p> 
<p>管家没有回答，只是点了点头。</p> 
<p>“告诉牛面将军雷金纳德爵一士，”阿特尔斯坦说，“我根本不怕他，我向他提出挑战，在我们获得自由后的八天内进行决个，不沦步战还是马战，在任何安全的地方都叮以。如果他是一个真正的骑士，在这种情况下，他就无权拒绝或拖延。”</p> 
<p>“我会向骑士转达您的挑战，”管家回答，“现在请您安心用膳．我告辞了。”</p> 
<p>阿特尔斯坦的挑战不是理直气壮提出的，因为他这时嘴里正塞着一大口食物，需要上下颚的同时活动，加上他天性优柔寡断，大大削弱了这个大胆抗议的效果。然而他的话还是得到了塞德里克的赞赏，认为这是他的朋友精神上复活的不容置疑的迹象——不论他如何尊重阿特尔斯坦的出身，他以前的麻木表现，已使他有些失去耐心了。于是他与他热烈握手，表示对他十分满意，但接着又有些失望，因为阿特尔斯坦又道：“这些人实在太糟了，好好的浓汤里放了这么多大蒜，要是我的挑战能使我们马上离开这个鬼地方．哪怕有十二个牛面将军，我也不怕。”不过虽然这些话又露出了只重口腹之欲的麻木心理，塞德里克还是在阿特尔斯坦对面坐了下去，马上汗始狼吞虎咽地吃了起来，这证明，尽管对祖国的忧虑可以使他对想象中的食物弃之不顾，当食物真正放在桌上的时候，撒克逊祖先的胃口看来还是与他们的其他特点一起传给他了。</p> 
<p>然而两位俘虏享用这顿饮食还没多久，耳中便传来了一阵号角声，打断了他们这项最严肃的任务。号音重复了三遍，响得山摇地动，仿佛奉命前来锄奸除暴的骑士已经到达魔窟门前，要用他的号音摧毁厅堂和塔楼，碉堡和雉堞，使整个城堡化为乌有了。两个撒克逊人从桌边一跃而起，跑到窗边。但是他们的好奇心没有如愿，山为从这些窗口只能看有到城堡的院子，号声却来自城堡以外。然而号角声似乎只有特殊的重要性，因为顷刻之间城堡内部便变得人声嘈杂，十分忙乱了。</p>
