<p>William de Wyvil and Stephen de Martival, the marshals of the field, were the first to offer their congratulations to the victor, praying him, at the same time, to suffer his helmet to be unlaced, or, at least, that he would raise his visor ere they conducted him to receive the prize of the day's tourney from the hands of Prince John. The Disinherited Knight, with all knightly courtesy, declined their request, alleging, that he could not at this time suffer his face to be seen, for reasons which he had assigned to the heralds when he entered the lists. The marshals were perfectly satisfied by this reply; for amidst the frequent and capricious vows by which knights were accustomed to bind themselves in the days of chivalry, there were none more common than those by which they engaged to remain incognito for a certain space, or until some particular adventure was achieved. The marshals, therefore, pressed no farther into the mystery of the Disinherited Knight, but, announcing to Prince John the conqueror's desire to remain unknown, they requested permission to bring him before his Grace, in order that he might receive the reward of his valour.</p> 
<p>John's curiosity was excited by the mystery observed by the stranger; and, being already displeased with the issue of the tournament, in which the challengers whom he favoured had been successively defeated by one knight, he answered haughtily to the marshals, "By the light of Our Lady's brow, this same knight hath been disinherited as well of his courtesy as of his lands, since he desires to appear before us without uncovering his face. ---Wot ye, my lords," he said, turning round to his train, "who this gallant can be, that bears himself thus proudly?"</p> 
<p>"I cannot guess," answered De Bracy, "nor did I think there had been within the four seas that girth Britain a champion that could bear down these five knights in one day's jousting. By my faith, I shall never forget the force with which he shocked De Vipont. The poor Hospitaller was hurled from his saddle like a stone from a sling."</p> 
<p>"Boast not of that," said a Knight of St John, who was present; "your Temple champion had no better luck. I saw your brave lance, Bois-Guilbert, roll thrice over, grasping his hands full of sand at every turn."</p> 
<p>De Bracy, being attached to the Templars, would have replied, but was prevented by Prince John. "Silence, sirs!" he said; "what unprofitable debate have we here?"</p> 
<p>"The victor," said De Wyvil, "still waits the pleasure of your highness."</p> 
<p>"It is our pleasure," answered John, "that he do so wait until we learn whether there is not some one who can at least guess at his name and quality. Should he remain there till night-fall, he has had work enough to keep him warm."</p> 
<p>"Your Grace," said Waldemar Fitzurse, "will do less than due honour to the victor, if you compel him to wait till we tell your highness that which we cannot know; at least I can form no guess ---unless he be one of the good lances who accompanied King Richard to Palestine, and who are now straggling homeward from the Holy Land."</p> 
<p>"It may be the Earl of Salisbury," said De Bracy; "he is about the same pitch."</p> 
<p>"Sir Thomas de Multon, the Knight of Gilsland, rather," said Fitzurse; "Salisbury is bigger in the bones." A whisper arose among the train, but by whom first suggested could not be ascertained. "It might be the King---it might be Richard Coeur-de-Lion himself!"</p> 
<p>"Over God's forbode!" said Prince John, involuntarily turning at the same time as pale as death, and shrinking as if blighted by a flash of lightning; "Waldemar!---De Bracy! brave knights and gentlemen, remember your promises, and stand truly by me!"</p> 
<p>"Here is no danger impending," said Waldemar Fitzurse; "are you so little acquainted with the gigantic limbs of your father's son, as to think they can be held within the circumference of yonder suit of armour?---De Wyvil and Martival, you will best serve the Prince by bringing forward the victor to the throne, and ending an error that has conjured all the blood from his cheeks.---Look at him more closely," he continued, "your highness will see that he wants three inches of King Richard's height, and twice as much of his shoulder-breadth. The very horse he backs, could not have carried the ponderous weight of King Richard through a single course."</p> 
<p>While he was yet speaking, the marshals brought forward the Disinherited Knight to the foot of a wooden flight of steps, which formed the ascent from the lists to Prince John's throne. Still discomposed with the idea that his brother, so much injured, and to whom he was so much indebted, had suddenly arrived in his native kingdom, even the distinctions pointed out by Fitzurse did not altogether remove the Prince's apprehensions; and while, with a short and embarrassed eulogy upon his valour, he caused to be delivered to him the war-horse assigned as the prize, he trembled lest from the barred visor of the mailed form before him, an answer might be returned, in the deep and awful accents of Richard the Lion-hearted.</p> 
<p>But the Disinherited Knight spoke not a word in reply to the compliment of the Prince, which he only acknowledged with a profound obeisance.</p> 
<p>The horse was led into the lists by two grooms richly dressed, the animal itself being fully accoutred with the richest war-furniture; which, however, scarcely added to the value of the noble creature in the eyes of those who were judges. Laying one hand upon the pommel of the saddle, the Disinherited Knight vaulted at once upon the back of the steed without making use of the stirrup, and, brandishing aloft his lance, rode twice around the lists, exhibiting the points and paces of the horse with the skill of a perfect horseman.</p> 
<p>The appearance of vanity, which might otherwise have been attributed to this display, was removed by the propriety shown in exhibiting to the best advantage the princely reward with which he had been just honoured, and the Knight was again greeted by the acclamations of all present.</p> 
<p>In the meanwhile, the bustling Prior of Jorvaulx had reminded Prince John, in a whisper, that the victor must now display his good judgment, instead of his valour, by selecting from among the beauties who graced the galleries a lady, who should fill the throne of the Queen of Beauty and of Love, and deliver the prize of the tourney upon the ensuing day. The Prince accordingly made a sign with his truncheon, as the Knight passed him in his second career around the lists. The Knight turned towards the throne, and, sinking his lance, until the point was within a foot of the ground, remained motionless, as if expecting John's commands; while all admired the sudden dexterity with which he instantly reduced his fiery steed from a state of violent emotion and high excitation to the stillness of an equestrian statue.</p> 
<p>"Sir Disinherited Knight," said Prince John, "since that is the only title by which we can address you, it is now your duty, as well as privilege, to name the fair lady, who, as Queen of Honour and of Love, is to preside over next day's festival. If, as a stranger in our land, you should require the aid of other judgment to guide your own, we can only say that Alicia, the daughter of our gallant knight Waldemar Fitzurse, has at our court been long held the first in beauty as in place. Nevertheless, it is your undoubted prerogative to confer on whom you please this crown, by the delivery of which to the lady of your choice, the election of to-morrow's Queen will be formal and complete.---Raise your lance."</p> 
<p>The Knight obeyed; and Prince John placed upon its point a coronet of green satin, having around its edge a circlet of gold, the upper edge of which was relieved by arrow-points and hearts placed interchangeably, like the strawberry leaves and balls upon a ducal crown.</p> 
<p>In the broad hint which he dropped respecting the daughter of Waldemar Fitzurse, John had more than one motive, each the offspring of a mind, which was a strange mixture of carelessness and presumption with low artifice and cunning. He wished to banish from the minds of the chivalry around him his own indecent and unacceptable jest respecting the Jewess Rebecca; he was desirous of conciliating Alicia's father Waldemar, of whom he stood in awe, and who had more than once shown himself dissatisfied during the course of the day's proceedings. He had also a wish to establish himself in the good graces of the lady; for John was at least as licentious in his pleasures as profligate in his ambition. But besides all these reasons, he was desirous to raise up against the Disinherited Knight (towards whom he already entertained a strong dislike) a powerful enemy in the person of Waldemar Fitzurse, who was likely, he thought, highly to resent the injury done to his daughter, in case, as was not unlikely, the victor should make another choice.</p> 
<p>And so indeed it proved. For the Disinherited Knight passed the gallery close to that of the Prince, in which the Lady Alicia was seated in the full pride of triumphant beauty, and, pacing forwards as slowly as he had hitherto rode swiftly around the lists, he seemed to exercise his right of examining the numerous fair faces which adorned that splendid circle.</p> 
<p>It was worth while to see the different conduct of the beauties who underwent this examination, during the time it was proceeding. Some blushed, some assumed an air of pride and dignity, some looked straight forward, and essayed to seem utterly unconscious of what was going on, some drew back in alarm, which was perhaps affected, some endeavoured to forbear smiling, and there were two or three who laughed outright. There were also some who dropped their veils over their charms; but, as the Wardour Manuscript says these were fair ones of ten years standing, it may be supposed that, having had their full share of such vanities, they were willing to withdraw their claim, in order to give a fair chance to the rising beauties of the age.</p> 
<p>At length the champion paused beneath the balcony in which the Lady Rowena was placed, and the expectation of the spectators was excited to the utmost.</p> 
<p>It must be owned, that if an interest displayed in his success could have bribed the Disinherited Knight, the part of the lists before which he paused had merited his predilection. Cedric the Saxon, overjoyed at the discomfiture of the Templar, and still more so at the miscarriage of his two malevolent neighbours, Front-de-Boeuf and Malvoisin, had, with his body half stretched over the balcony, accompanied the victor in each course, not with his eyes only, but with his whole heart and soul. The Lady Rowena had watched the progress of the day with equal attention, though without openly betraying the same intense interest. Even the unmoved Athelstane had shown symptoms of shaking off his apathy, when, calling for a huge goblet of muscadine, he quaffed it to the health of the Disinherited Knight. Another group, stationed under the gallery occupied by the Saxons, had shown no less interest in the fate of the day.</p> 
<p>"Father Abraham!" said Isaac of York, when the first course was run betwixt the Templar and the Disinherited Knight, "how fiercely that Gentile rides! Ah, the good horse that was brought all the long way from Barbary, he takes no more care of him than if he were a wild ass's colt---and the noble armour, that was worth so many zecchins to Joseph Pareira, the armourer of Milan, besides seventy in the hundred of profits, he cares for it as little as if he had found it in the highways!"</p> 
<p>"If he risks his own person and limbs, father," said Rebecca, "in doing such a dreadful battle, he can scarce be expected to spare his horse and armour."</p> 
<p>"Child!" replied Isaac, somewhat heated, "thou knowest not what thou speakest---His neck and limbs are his own, but his horse and armour belong to---Holy Jacob! what was I about to say! ---Nevertheless, it is a good youth---See, Rebecca! see, he is again about to go up to battle against the Philistine---Pray, child---pray for the safety of the good youth,---and of the speedy horse, and the rich armour.---God of my fathers!" he again exclaimed, "he hath conquered, and the uncircumcised Philistine hath fallen before his lance,---even as Og the King of Bashan, and Sihon, King of the Amorites, fell before the sword of our fathers!---Surely he shall take their gold and their silver, and their war-horses, and their armour of brass and of steel, for a prey and for a spoil."</p> 
<p>The same anxiety did the worthy Jew display during every course that was run, seldom failing to hazard a hasty calculation concerning the value of the horse and armour which was forfeited to the champion upon each new success. There had been therefore no small interest taken in the success of the Disinherited Knight, by those who occupied the part of the lists before which he now paused.</p> 
<p>Whether from indecision, or some other motive of hesitation, the champion of the day remained stationary for more than a minute, while the eyes of the silent audience were riveted upon his motions; and then, gradually and gracefully sinking the point of his lance, he deposited the coronet which it supported at the feet of the fair Rowena. The trumpets instantly sounded, while the heralds proclaimed the Lady Rowena the Queen of Beauty and of Love for the ensuing day, menacing with suitable penalties those who should be disobedient to her authority. They then repeated their cry of Largesse, to which Cedric, in the height of his joy, replied by an ample donative, and to which Athelstane, though less promptly, added one equally large.</p> 
<p>There was some murmuring among the damsels of Norman descent, who were as much unused to see the preference given to a Saxon beauty, as the Norman nobles were to sustain defeat in the games of chivalry which they themselves had introduced. But these sounds of disaffection were drowned by the popular shout of "Long live the Lady Rowena, the chosen and lawful Queen of Love and of Beauty!" To which many in the lower area added, "Long live the Saxon Princess! long live the race of the immortal Alfred!"</p> 
<p>However unacceptable these sounds might be to Prince John, and to those around him, he saw himself nevertheless obliged to confirm the nomination of the victor, and accordingly calling to horse, he left his throne; and mounting his jennet, accompanied by his train, he again entered the lists. The Prince paused a moment beneath the gallery of the Lady Alicia, to whom he paid his compliments, observing, at the same time, to those around him ---"By my halidome, sirs! if the Knight's feats in arms have shown that he hath limbs and sinews, his choice hath no less proved that his eyes are none of the clearest."</p> 
<p>It was on this occasion, as during his whole life, John's misfortune, not perfectly to understand the characters of those whom he wished to conciliate. Waldemar Fitzurse was rather offended than pleased at the Prince stating thus broadly an opinion, that his daughter had been slighted.</p> 
<p>"I know no right of chivalry," he said, "more precious or inalienable than that of each free knight to choose his lady-love by his own judgment. My daughter courts distinction from no one; and in her own character, and in her own sphere, will never fail to receive the full proportion of that which is her due."</p> 
<p>Prince John replied not; but, spurring his horse, as if to give vent to his vexation, he made the animal bound forward to the gallery where Rowena was seated, with the crown still at her feet.</p> 
<p>"Assume," he said, "fair lady, the mark of your sovereignty, to which none vows homage more sincerely than ourself, John of Anjou; and if it please you to-day, with your noble sire and friends, to grace our banquet in the Castle of Ashby, we shall learn to know the empress to whose service we devote to-morrow."</p> 
<p>Rowena remained silent, and Cedric answered for her in his native Saxon.</p> 
<p>"The Lady Rowena," he said, "possesses not the language in which to reply to your courtesy, or to sustain her part in your festival. I also, and the noble Athelstane of Coningsburgh, speak only the language, and practise only the manners, of our fathers. We therefore decline with thanks your Highness's courteous invitation to the banquet. To-morrow, the Lady Rowena will take upon her the state to which she has been called by the free election of the victor Knight, confirmed by the acclamations of the people."</p> 
<p>So saying, he lifted the coronet, and placed it upon Rowena's head, in token of her acceptance of the temporary authority assigned to her.</p> 
<p>"What says he?" said Prince John, affecting not to understand the Saxon language, in which, however, he was well skilled. The purport of Cedric's speech was repeated to him in French. "It is well," he said; "to-morrow we will ourself conduct this mute sovereign to her seat of dignity.---You, at least, Sir Knight," he added, turning to the victor, who had remained near the gallery, "will this day share our banquet?"</p> 
<p>The Knight, speaking for the first time, in a low and hurried voice, excused himself by pleading fatigue, and the necessity of preparing for to-morrow's encounter.</p> 
<p>"It is well," said Prince John, haughtily; "although unused to such refusals, we will endeavour to digest our banquet as we may, though ungraced by the most successful in arms, and his elected Queen of Beauty."</p> 
<p>So saying, he prepared to leave the lists with his glittering train, and his turning his steed for that purpose, was the signal for the breaking up and dispersion of the spectators.</p> 
<p>Yet, with the vindictive memory proper to offended pride, especially when combined with conscious want of desert, John had hardly proceeded three paces, ere again, turning around, he fixed an eye of stern resentment upon the yeoman who had displeased him in the early part of the day, and issued his commands to the men-at-arms who stood near---"On your life, suffer not that fellow to escape."</p> 
<p>The yeoman stood the angry glance of the Prince with the same unvaried steadiness which had marked his former deportment, saying, with a smile, "I have no intention to leave Ashby until the day after to-morrow---I must see how Staffordshire and Leicestershire can draw their bows---the forests of Needwood and Charnwood must rear good archers."</p> 
<p>"I," said Prince John to his attendants, but not in direct reply, ---"I will see how he can draw his own; and woe betide him unless his skill should prove some apology for his insolence!"</p> 
<p>"It is full time," said De Bracy, "that the 'outrecuidance'*</p> 
<p>* Presumption, insolence.</p> 
<p>of these peasants should be restrained by some striking example."</p> 
<p>Waldemar Fitzurse, who probably thought his patron was not taking the readiest road to popularity, shrugged up his shoulders and was silent. Prince John resumed his retreat from the lists, and the dispersion of the multitude became general.</p> 
<p>In various routes, according to the different quarters from which they came, and in groups of various numbers, the spectators were seen retiring over the plain. By far the most numerous part streamed towards the town of Ashby, where many of the distinguished persons were lodged in the castle, and where others found accommodation in the town itself. Among these were most of the knights who had already appeared in the tournament, or who proposed to fight there the ensuing day, and who, as they rode slowly along, talking over the events of the day, were greeted with loud shouts by the populace. The same acclamations were bestowed upon Prince John, although he was indebted for them rather to the splendour of his appearance and train, than to the popularity of his character.</p> 
<p>A more sincere and more general, as well as a better-merited acclamation, attended the victor of the day, until, anxious to withdraw himself from popular notice, he accepted the accommodation of one of those pavilions pitched at the extremities of the lists, the use of which was courteously tendered him by the marshals of the field. On his retiring to his tent, many who had lingered in the lists, to look upon and form conjectures concerning him, also dispersed.</p> 
<p>The signs and sounds of a tumultuous concourse of men lately crowded together in one place, and agitated by the same passing events, were now exchanged for the distant hum of voices of different groups retreating in all directions, and these speedily died away in silence. No other sounds were heard save the voices of the menials who stripped the galleries of their cushions and tapestry, in order to put them in safety for the night, and wrangled among themselves for the half-used bottles of wine and relics of the refreshment which had been served round to the spectators.</p> 
<p>Beyond the precincts of the lists more than one forge was erected; and these now began to glimmer through the twilight, announcing the toil of the armourers, which was to continue through the whole night, in order to repair or alter the suits of armour to be used again on the morrow.</p> 
<p>A strong guard of men-at-arms, renewed at intervals, from two hours to two hours, surrounded the lists, and kept watch during the night.</p>

<p>《花与叶》(注)</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)这是英国古代的一首长诗，作者已不可考，从前一度曾被认为是乔叟的作品；</p> 
<p>最先向胜利者表示祝贺的，是两位警卫督察威廉·怀维尔和斯蒂芬·马提瓦尔，同时他们还要求他解下帽盔，至少把面甲拉起一些，好让他们带他前去参见约翰亲王，领取当天比武的奖赏。剥夺继承权的骑士按照骑士的礼节，表示了感谢，但拒绝了他们的要求，声称他目前还不便公开他的面貌，理由他已在入场时向典礼官说明过了。警卫督察对这答复完全满意，因为在骑士时代，骑士往往会许下各种不可思议的誓愿，约束自己的行动，他们在一定时期内，或者在完成某种惊人的业绩以前，隐瞒自己的姓名更是司空见惯的。这样，两位警卫督察不再向剥夺继承权的骑士追问他的秘密，径直向约翰亲王报告，胜利者不愿透露姓名，要求让他就这样前来谒见殿下，以便为他的勇敢接受犒赏。</p> 
<p>陌生人的古怪举措引起了亲王的好奇心；这次比武的结果本来已使他很不高兴，几个挑战者都是他所器重的，现在却接连败在一个无名小子手下，这小子对警卫督察的回答又如此傲慢，于是他说道：“我凭圣母头上的灵光起誓，这个骑士既然不肯在我们面前揭开脸甲，那么他不仅失去了他的继承权，也失去了他应该得到的礼遇。”接着又转身对他周围的人说道：“诸位大人，你们说，这个小伙子这么自以为了不起，他究竟是谁？”</p> 
<p>“我猜不出，”德布拉西回答，“我还认为，在英伦三岛内没有一个武士能在一天的比武中，接连打败这五名骑士。老实说，我永远不会忘记，他冲向维庞特的力量有多大。可怜的医护骑士竟在马上坐不住，像弹石弓上的石块一样，一下子给撂到了地上。”</p> 
<p>“别夸大其词，”在场的一个医护团骑士说道，“你们的圣殿骑士也不见得高明多少。我看见你们那位勇敢的武士布瓦吉贝尔在地上滚了三次，每次都抓了满满两手的黄土。”</p> 
<p>德布拉西一向偏袒圣殿骑士，正想回答，给约翰亲王拦住了。“安静，各位先生！”他说，“这种争论有什么意义？”</p> 
<p>“胜利者还在等待殿下的召见呢，”怀维尔说。</p> 
<p>“那就请他等着，”约翰回答，“至少等到我们中间有人猜到他的姓名和身分以后再说。哪怕他要等到天黑也没关系，他累了一天该休息一会了。”</p> 
<p>“殿下，”沃尔德马·菲泽西说道，“如果您非要他等待不可，这对胜利者未免有失公允，因为我们所不知道的事是无从猜测的，至少我猜不出，除非说，那是跟随理查国王前往巴勒斯坦的几个武艺高强的武士中的一个，他们现在正仆仆风尘从圣地回国呢。”</p> 
<p>“那么这可能是索尔兹伯里伯爵，”德布拉酉说，“他的身材差不多。”</p> 
<p>“还是像吉尔斯兰的骑士托马斯·麦尔顿，”菲泽西说，“索尔兹伯里的骨骼还要大一些。”这时随员中有人在轻轻议论，但是不能确定是谁说出了这么一句话：“说不定这便是国王——狮心工理查本人！”</p> 
<p>“这简直太荒唐了！”约翰亲王说，不禁转过身来，脸色变得死一般苍白，仿佛给突然发出的闪电吓了一跳。“沃尔德马！德布拉酉！勇敢的骑士们和绅士们，别忘记你们的诺言，忠诚不渝地站在我一边！”</p> 
<p>“目前还不存在这种危险，”沃尔德马·菲泽西答道，“难道您对您父亲那个儿子的四肢有多大，竟也不知道，以致认为那套铠甲容纳得了他的身体不成？怀维尔和马提瓦尔，你们现在能为亲王做的最好的事，还是把胜利者马上带来见他，别再胡乱猜测，弄得他心神不定。您不妨仔细瞧瞧他，”他继续对亲王说，“您就会发现，他比理查国王矮三英寸，肩膀更是窄了六英寸。他骑的那匹马载不动理查国王，哪怕跑一圈也不成。”</p> 
<p>他还没讲完，警卫督察已把剥夺继承权的骑士带到约翰亲王的宝座下面，站在通向看台的木阶梯前面。亲王这时仍心烦意乱，想到那位对他恩重如山，他又思将仇报的兄长，忽然回到了祖国，怎么也安静不下，菲泽西指出的那些特征，并不能完全消除他的疑虑；他心乱如麻，勉强对骑士讲了几句赞扬的话，便吩咐把他赏赐的一匹战马牵给他，但心里仍惴惴不安，唯恐从面甲后面发出的声音，终于证实那便是狮心工理查深沉而可怕的嗓音。</p> 
<p>但是剥夺继承权的骑士听了亲王的赞扬，没有回答一句话，只是用深深的鞠躬表示了感谢。</p> 
<p>马由两个衣着华丽的马夫牵到了场子中间，牲口身上的全副作战装备也是最豪华的；然而在真正识马的人眼中，这套装备与那匹骏马本身的价值相比，依然微不足道。剥夺继承权的骑士把一只手搭在鞍子的前鞒上，纵身一跃，跳上了马背，没有使用脚镫；他在马上挥舞着长枪，绕场子骑了两圈，凭一个骑手纯熟的技巧，显示了马的英姿和步态。</p> 
<p>这番表演本可以被人讥为虚荣心理的流露，然而这马是亲王的赏赐，充分显示它的优点是合乎礼节，无可非议的，因此场子里又欢声雷动，再一次向骑士表示了祝贺。</p> 
<p>茹尔沃修道院院长趁此机会，赶紧凑在约翰亲王耳边，提醒他现在得让胜利者表现他高超的判断力，而不是他的武艺了，他应该从看台上花枝招展的美女中选出一位小姐，充当爱和美的女王，为明天的比武颁奖了。这样，当骑士在场上跑第二圈，经过亲王面前时，他便举起权杖，示意他停下。骑士立即向亲王驰去，把枪尖朝下，等它离地不到一英尺时，他已一动不动地站住，仿佛在等待亲王的命令；这种能使一匹战马从剧烈的奔跑和兴奋中，蓦地站住，变成塑像一般的娴熟骑术，赢得了场上所有的人的啧啧赞赏。</p> 
<p>“剥夺继承权的骑士，”约翰亲王说， “由于你没有别的名字，我们只得这么称呼你了。现在你的责任，同时也是你的特权，便是指定一位漂亮的小姐担任爱和美的女王，主持明天的比武盛典。如果你在我们这片国土上是外地人，需要别人帮助你作出选择，那么我们能说的只是：我们的英勇骑士沃尔德马·菲泽西的女儿艾利西姬，论美貌和地位在我们的朝廷中，都是久负盛誉，被公认为首屈一指的。不过你喜欢把这顶王冠给予谁，便可给予谁，这是你不可剥夺的权利，你所选中的小姐，便是手续完备的、正式选出的明天的女王。举起你的枪。”</p> 
<p>骑士举起了枪，约翰亲王把一顶翠绿缎子冠冕挂在枪尖上，冠冕边缘有一圈黄金，金圈上面的边是由箭头和鸡心交错组成，与公爵冠冕上的草莓叶和圆球一样。</p> 
<p>约翰亲王为沃尔德马·菲泽西的女儿作了明确的提示，这不止出于一个动机，但每个动机都是轻率、自负的心理，与卑鄙的权术和狡猾结合而成的产物。他就犹太女子而贝卡讲的笑话，显得过于粗俗，不能为人接受，现在他希望从周围骑士的心目中消除它所造成的影响。他对艾利西娅的父亲沃尔德马一向有些畏惧，这天在比武场上，后者又多次表示了对他的不满，现在他想借此机会取得他的欢心；他还希望得到那位小姐的青睐，因为约翰不仅野心勃勃，至少还热衷于寻欢作乐。除了这一切，他还对剥夺继承权的骑士怀有强烈的不满，现在便试图煽起沃尔德马·菲泽西对他的仇恨，因为艾利西娅很可能落选，而一旦落选，这位大臣自然会为她的耻辱，与那个骑士结下深仇大恨。</p> 
<p>事实证明的确如此。艾利西姬小姐便坐在亲王旁边的那个看台上，显得扬扬得意，似乎女王的头衔非她莫属，可是剥夺继承权的骑士从台前走了过去，尽管他现在骑得相当慢，与刚才的绕场飞驰大不相同，仿佛在行使审查的权利，仔细端详点缀在场子周围的无数漂亮脸蛋。</p> 
<p>在接受审查的过程中，美女们的表现真是千姿百态，值得一看。有的涨红了脸；有的装出一副矜持和端庄的神态；有的眼睛望着前面，仿佛根本不知道发生了什么事；有的吓得缩在后面，不过这也可能是假装害羞；有的强作镇静，露出了微笑；也有两三个人若无其事，只顾放声大笑。还有几个人放下了面纱，不让人看到她们的容貌，不过据《沃杜尔文稿》说，这些都是红颜半老的美女，可以想象，她们对这类虚名已有过十年的体会，现在只得心甘情愿不再争妍斗胜，把机会让给后起之秀了。</p> 
<p>最后，武士停在一个看台下，罗文娜小姐便在上面，全场观众的心终于兴奋到了极点。</p> 
<p>必须承认，剥夺继承权的骑士获得胜利时，这部分看台的反应最为强烈，如果这引起了他的好感，那么他对这看台有所偏爱，停留在这儿是不奇怪的。圣殿骑士的狼狈下场，固然令撒克逊人塞德里克大喜过望，他那两个心怀叵测的邻居牛面将军和马尔沃辛的失败，更叫他兴奋不已，把半个身子伸到了看台外面；在每次交锋中他不是用眼睛盯着胜利者，而是把整个心灵都扑到了他身上。罗文娜小姐也同样目不转睛地注视着比武的进展，只是没有公开流露紧张的心情。甚至从不激动的阿特尔斯坦也显得兴致勃勃，不再无动于衷，还叫人给了他一大杯麝香葡萄酒，把它一饮而尽，向剥夺继承权的骑士表示祝贺。</p> 
<p>撒克逊人占据的看台下面，还有另一群人对当天比武的结果表现了同样大的兴趣。</p> 
<p>“我们的始祖亚伯拉罕啊！”约克的以撒在圣殿骑士和剥夺继承权的骑士进行第一轮比赛时，这么说，“这些外邦人骑起马来简直不要命了！唉，这么好一匹马是千里迢迢从柏柏里(注)运来的，他却不当它一回事，好像这是一只小野驴崽子；那身贵重的盔甲，在米兰的盔甲匠约瑟夫·佩莱拉眼里一定价值连城，卖出去可以有百分之七十的利润，他却满不在乎，好像那是路上捡来的！”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)柏柏里，北非沿海地区的古代名称。</p> 
<p>“既然他不惜拿他的性命和身体冒险，参加这么一场可怕的战斗，”丽贝卡说，“父亲，你怎么还能指望他顾全他的马和盔甲呢？”</p> 
<p>“孩子！”以撒回答，有些烦躁，“你不明白你在说些什么。他的性命和身体是他自己的，但是他的马和盔甲是属于……啊，神圣的雅各！我怎么差点说了出来？不过话说回来，这是一个好青年。瞧，丽贝卡！……瞧，他又要跟非利士人(注1)决斗了！祈祷吧，孩子，为这个好青年的安全，为这匹瞟悍的马和这套贵重的盔甲祈祷吧。我们祖先的上帝啊！”他又喊道，“他胜利了，不行割礼的非利士人倒在他的长枪前面，简直像巴珊的王噩，亚摩利人的王西宏，(注2)倒在我们祖先的剑下一样！他一定会夺取他们的黄金和白银，他们的战马，他们的铜的和钢的盔甲，他可以发一笔大财了！”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注1)非利士人，古代与犹太人为敌的一支民族．后为以色列王大卫所打败，见《圣经》。</p> 
<p>(注2)巴珊和亚摩利都是巴勒斯坦一带的古国，后被以色列人征服，见《圣经·申命记》等。</p> 
<p>精明的犹太人对每一轮比赛都看得同样起劲，同时没有忘记在心里匆匆计算，勇士可以从每一次新的胜利中没收的战马和盔甲的价值。就这样，现在剥夺继承权的骑士面前那部分场子上的人，都是对他的胜利表现过极大的兴趣的。</p> 
<p>不知是出于拿不定主意，还是其他犹豫的动机，这位今天的英雄在看台前站立了不止一分钟，肃静的观众都把眼睛紧盯着他的举动；接着，他不慌不忙、从容不迫地让枪尖降低一些，把挑在枪尖上的王冠放到了美丽的罗文娜的脚边。号声顿时响了，典礼官宣布，罗文娜小姐当选为下一天爱和美的女王，谁不服从她的权威便将受到相应的惩罚。然后他们又大喊：“赏钱”，塞德里克欢天喜地的，当即扔下了一大笔赏金，阿特尔斯坦虽然迟了一步，也丢下了同样多的数目。</p> 
<p>诺曼血统的妇女中发出了一片喊喊喳喳的低语声，把荣誉给予一个撒克逊美女是从未有过的，她们受不了，正如诺曼贵族受不了在他们自己引进的武艺比赛中惨败一样。但这些不满的声音都湮没在群众的欢呼中了，他们大喊：“正式当选为爱和美的女王的罗文娜小姐万岁！”下面场地上的许多人还喊道：“撒克逊公主万岁！不朽的阿尔弗烈德工族万岁！”</p> 
<p>不论这些喊声，约翰亲王和他周围的人多么不能接受，他还是看到他不得不允准优胜者的任命，因此吩咐备马，离开了座位，骑上他的西班牙马，在众人的簇拥下，再度走进场子。在艾利西娅小姐的看台前面，亲王停了一下向她表示敬意，同时对他身边的人说道：“上帝知道，诸位大人！如果这位勇士的武艺说明他的四肢和肌肉多么发达，他的选择却证明他的眼光还是很不高明的。”</p> 
<p>约翰的这一举动，正如他一生的其他表现一样，让人看到，他的不幸正在于不能深刻理解他希望笼络的那些人的性格。沃尔德马·菲泽西听到亲王这么大事渲染他的女儿遭到的轻视，只是觉得生气，不是高兴。</p> 
<p>“我只知道，”他说，“骑士制度最公正无私、最不容侵犯的规则，便是骑士有权根据他自己的判断，选择他心爱的小姐。我的女儿不想靠任何人的恩赐出人头地，她凭自己的品质和身分，永远不会得不到与她完全相称的荣誉。”</p> 
<p>约翰亲王没有回答，只是踢了踢马，仿佛要发泄他的烦恼，让马向前直跑，来到了罗文娜的看台前面，那顶王冠还在她的脚下。</p> 
<p>“美丽的小姐，”他说，“请戴上女王的标志吧，它赋予您的权力是安茹家(注)的约翰所衷心尊敬的。如果您愿意，请与今尊和您的亲友一起光临今天在阿什口城堡举行的宴会，以便我们与我们明天要效忠的女王增进一些了解。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)诺曼王朝传至斯蒂芬无嗣，由法国安茹家的亨利（诺曼王朝亨利一世的外孙）继承，称亨利二世，是为金雀花王朝的开始。</p> 
<p>罗文娜没有作声，塞德里克用撒克逊语替她作了回答。</p> 
<p>“罗文娜小姐不懂得您的语言，”他说，“因此她无法回答您的礼遇，也不能参加您的宴会。我和尊贵的科宁斯堡的阿特尔斯坦也一样，我们只讲我们祖先的语言，按照祖先的方式行事。因此我们感谢殿下的好意邀请，但只得谢绝赴宴。明天，罗文娜小姐将按照优胜骑士的自由选择赋予她的、又经人民的欢呼所确认的荣誉，履行她的职责。”</p> 
<p>这么说后，他举起冠冕，把它戴在罗文娜的头上，表示她接受了授予她的临时权力。</p> 
<p>“他说什么来着？”约翰亲王说，假装听不懂撒克逊语，其实他是完全懂得的。塞德里克那一席话的主要内容，只得由别人用法语向他重复一遍。“很好，”他说，“明天我会亲自带这位不开口的女王登上她的宝座。骑士先生，”他又转身向仍待在看台旁边的优胜者说道，“至少您会参加我们的宴会吧？”</p> 
<p>骑士第一次开了口，用低低的、极快的声音表示了歉意，因为他太累了，需要休息，为明天的比赛作准备。</p> 
<p>“好吧，”亲王用傲慢的口气答道，“这种拒绝不合常情，不过我们还是会尽量吃好这一顿筵席的，哪怕最成功的武士和他所选出的女王不肯赏光。”</p> 
<p>这么说完，他便准备率领他那些衣着华丽的随员离开比武场了；他掉转马头，表示大会已经结束，可以散场了。</p> 
<p>然而自尊心受到了伤害，总会念念不忘寻求报复，尤其是认为自己并非罪有应得时，因此约翰还没走出三步，又转过身来，瞪起怒冲冲的眼睛，向今天早上惹他不快的自耕农发出了狠狠的一瞥，然后命令站在他附近的卫士道：“注意，绝对别让那家伙溜走。”</p> 
<p>在亲王愤怒的目光面前，庄户人毫无惧色，依然保持着原先泰然自若的神态。微微一晒道：“我在后天以前还不打算离开阿什贝。我得看看，斯塔福郡和莱斯特郡的弓箭手有多大能耐；生长在尼德伍德和查思伍德森林中的人应该是擅长射箭的。”</p> 
<p>“我也得瞧瞧他自己的箭射得怎样呢，”约翰亲王并不正面回答他，却对他的随从说道，“除非他的箭法证明他的傲慢还有些道理，否则我决不轻饶他！”</p> 
<p>“这些狂妄自大的农夫太放肆了，”德布拉西说，“应该惩办一两个才好。”</p> 
<p>沃尔德马·菲泽西也许觉得，他的主子还不懂得笼络民心，错过了这个大好时机，因而耸了耸肩膀，保持着沉默。约翰亲王重又朝场子外面走去，群众正在纷纷散场。</p> 
<p>他们来自不同的地区，现在便遵循不同的路线，分成许多股人群，一伙一伙地离开这片平原。数目最多的一股人流是前往阿什贝镇的，不少头面人物寄寓在那里的城堡中，其余的人则住在镇上。其中大多是骑士，有的已在今天的比武大会中亮过相，有的则准备在正下一天一献身手。由于他们骑得很慢，一边走一边闲谈今天的盛况，他们受到了群众的大声欢呼。约翰亲王也成了这种欢呼的目标，然而这与其说是对他的爱戴，不如说是对他和他的随从们的华丽衣着的赞美。</p> 
<p>对当天的优胜者的欢呼，那就比较真诚，也更普遍了，这是他当之无愧的；最后，他为了脱身，避免观众的注意，只得接受警卫督察的好意，钻进了他们为他提供的一座帐篷，它位在场子的北端。这样，为了看他，为了揣摩他的来历，在比武场上流连不走的许多人，目送他进入帐篷休息以后，也陆续离开了。</p> 
<p>就这样，不久以前还聚集在一个地方，争相观看同一些场面的喧闹沸腾的人群，终于逐渐分散，变成了各奔东西的人流，那嘈杂的讲话声也慢慢消失，转化成遥远的嗡嗡声，然后迅速地归于沉寂了。现在除了几个仆人偶尔发出的几句话，已听不到别的声音，他们有的正忙于收拾看台上的垫子和帷幔，让它们可以安然无恙地度过黑夜，也有的在彼此争夺当初向观众兜售的、还没喝完的酒和吃剩的糕点。</p> 
<p>比武场的周围出现了几个锻铁炉，它们在朦胧的夜幕下发出熊熊火光，向人们宣告，铠甲匠们正在通宵达旦地劳动，修补或改制一套套盔甲，以便明天使用。</p> 
<p>一队队雄赳赳的卫士分布在场子四周，每两小时换一次班，整夜保持着警戒。</p>
