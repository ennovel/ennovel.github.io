Speed: Sir, we are undone! these are the villains That all the travellers do fear so much. Val: My friends,--- 1st Out: That's not so, sir, we are your enemies. 2d Out: Peace! we'll hear him. 3d Out: Ay, by my beard, will we; For he's a proper man. Two Gentlemen of Verona</p> 
<p>The nocturnal adventures of Gurth were not yet concluded; indeed he himself became partly of that mind, when, after passing one or two straggling houses which stood in the outskirts of the village, he found himself in a deep lane, running between two banks overgrown with hazel and holly, while here and there a dwarf oak flung its arms altogether across the path. The lane was moreover much rutted and broken up by the carriages which had recently transported articles of various kinds to the tournament; and it was dark, for the banks and bushes intercepted the light of the harvest moon.</p> 
<p>From the village were heard the distant sounds of revelry, mixed occasionally with loud laughter, sometimes broken by screams, and sometimes by wild strains of distant music. All these sounds, intimating the disorderly state of the town, crowded with military nobles and their dissolute attendants, gave Gurth some uneasiness. "The Jewess was right," he said to himself. "By heaven and St Dunstan, I would I were safe at my journey's end with all this treasure! Here are such numbers, I will not say of arrant thieves, but of errant knights and errant squires, errant monks and errant minstrels, errant jugglers and errant jesters, that a man with a single merk would be in danger, much more a poor swineherd with a whole bagful of zecchins. Would I were out of the shade of these infernal bushes, that I might at least see any of St Nicholas's clerks before they spring on my shoulders."</p> 
<p>Gurth accordingly hastened his pace, in order to gain the open common to which the lane led, but was not so fortunate as to accomplish his object. Just as he had attained the upper end of the lane, where the underwood was thickest, four men sprung upon him, even as his fears anticipated, two from each side of the road, and seized him so fast, that resistance, if at first practicable, would have been now too late.---"Surrender your charge," said one of them; "we are the deliverers of the commonwealth, who ease every man of his burden."</p> 
<p>"You should not ease me of mine so lightly," muttered Gurth, whose surly honesty could not be tamed even by the pressure of immediate violence,---"had I it but in my power to give three strokes in its defence."</p> 
<p>"We shall see that presently," said the robber; and, speaking to his companions, he added, "bring along the knave. I see he would have his head broken, as well as his purse cut, and so be let blood in two veins at once."</p> 
<p>Gurth was hurried along agreeably to this mandate, and having been dragged somewhat roughly over the bank, on the left-hand side of the lane, found himself in a straggling thicket, which lay betwixt it and the open common. He was compelled to follow his rough conductors into the very depth of this cover, where they stopt unexpectedly in an irregular open space, free in a great measure from trees, and on which, therefore, the beams of the moon fell without much interruption from boughs and leaves. Here his captors were joined by two other persons, apparently belonging to the gang. They had short swords by their sides, and quarter-staves in their hands, and Gurth could now observe that all six wore visors, which rendered their occupation a matter of no question, even had their former proceedings left it in doubt.</p> 
<p>"What money hast thou, churl?" said one of the thieves.</p> 
<p>"Thirty zecchins of my own property," answered Gurth, doggedly.</p> 
<p>"A forfeit---a forfeit," shouted the robbers; "a Saxon hath thirty zecchins, and returns sober from a village! An undeniable and unredeemable forfeit of all he hath about him."</p> 
<p>"I hoarded it to purchase my freedom," said Gurth.</p> 
<p>"Thou art an ass," replied one of the thieves "three quarts of double ale had rendered thee as free as thy master, ay, and freer too, if he be a Saxon like thyself."</p> 
<p>"A sad truth," replied Gurth; "but if these same thirty zecchins will buy my freedom from you, unloose my hands, and I will pay them to you."</p> 
<p>"Hold," said one who seemed to exercise some authority over the others; "this bag which thou bearest, as I can feel through thy cloak, contains more coin than thou hast told us of."</p> 
<p>"It is the good knight my master's," answered Gurth, "of which, assuredly, I would not have spoken a word, had you been satisfied with working your will upon mine own property."</p> 
<p>"Thou art an honest fellow," replied the robber, "I warrant thee; and we worship not St Nicholas so devoutly but what thy thirty zecchins may yet escape, if thou deal uprightly with us. Meantime render up thy trust for a time." So saying, he took from Gurth's breast the large leathern pouch, in which the purse given him by Rebecca was enclosed, as well as the rest of the zecchins, and then continued his interrogation.---"Who is thy master?"</p> 
<p>"The Disinherited Knight," said Gurth.</p> 
<p>"Whose good lance," replied the robber, "won the prize in to-day's tourney? What is his name and lineage?"</p> 
<p>"It is his pleasure," answered Gurth, "that they be concealed; and from me, assuredly, you will learn nought of them."</p> 
<p>"What is thine own name and lineage?"</p> 
<p>"To tell that," said Gurth, "might reveal my master's."</p> 
<p>"Thou art a saucy groom," said the robber, "but of that anon. How comes thy master by this gold? is it of his inheritance, or by what means hath it accrued to him?"</p> 
<p>"By his good lance," answered Gurth.---"These bags contain the ransom of four good horses, and four good suits of armour."</p> 
<p>"How much is there?" demanded the robber.</p> 
<p>"Two hundred zecchins."</p> 
<p>"Only two hundred zecchins!" said the bandit; "your master hath dealt liberally by the vanquished, and put them to a cheap ransom. Name those who paid the gold."</p> 
<p>Gurth did so.</p> 
<p>"The armour and horse of the Templar Brian de Bois-Guilbert, at what ransom were they held?---Thou seest thou canst not deceive me."</p> 
<p>"My master," replied Gurth, "will take nought from the Templar save his life's-blood. They are on terms of mortal defiance, and cannot hold courteous intercourse together."</p> 
<p>"Indeed!"---repeated the robber, and paused after he had said the word. "And what wert thou now doing at Ashby with such a charge in thy custody?"</p> 
<p>"I went thither to render to Isaac the Jew of York," replied Gurth, "the price of a suit of armour with which he fitted my master for this tournament."</p> 
<p>"And how much didst thou pay to Isaac?---Methinks, to judge by weight, there is still two hundred zecchins in this pouch."</p> 
<p>"I paid to Isaac," said the Saxon, "eighty zecchins, and he restored me a hundred in lieu thereof."</p> 
<p>"How! what!" exclaimed all the robbers at once; "darest thou trifle with us, that thou tellest such improbable lies?"</p> 
<p>"What I tell you," said Gurth, "is as true as the moon is in heaven. You will find the just sum in a silken purse within the leathern pouch, and separate from the rest of the gold."</p> 
<p>"Bethink thee, man," said the Captain, "thou speakest of a Jew ---of an Israelite,---as unapt to restore gold, as the dry sand of his deserts to return the cup of water which the pilgrim spills upon them."</p> 
<p>"There is no more mercy in them," said another of the banditti, "than in an unbribed sheriffs officer."</p> 
<p>"It is, however, as I say," said Gurth.</p> 
<p>"Strike a light instantly," said the Captain; "I will examine this said purse; and if it be as this fellow says, the Jew's bounty is little less miraculous than the stream which relieved his fathers in the wilderness."</p> 
<p>A light was procured accordingly, and the robber proceeded to examine the purse. The others crowded around him, and even two who had hold of Gurth relaxed their grasp while they stretched their necks to see the issue of the search. Availing himself of their negligence, by a sudden exertion of strength and activity, Gurth shook himself free of their hold, and might have escaped, could he have resolved to leave his master's property behind him. But such was no part of his intention. He wrenched a quarter-staff from one of the fellows, struck down the Captain, who was altogether unaware of his purpose, and had well-nigh repossessed himself of the pouch and treasure. The thieves, however, were too nimble for him, and again secured both the bag and the trusty Gurth.</p> 
<p>"Knave!" said the Captain, getting up, "thou hast broken my head; and with other men of our sort thou wouldst fare the worse for thy insolence. But thou shalt know thy fate instantly. First let us speak of thy master; the knight's matters must go before the squire's, according to the due order of chivalry. Stand thou fast in the meantime---if thou stir again, thou shalt have that will make thee quiet for thy life---Comrades!" he then said, addressing his gang, "this purse is embroidered with Hebrew characters, and I well believe the yeoman's tale is true. The errant knight, his master, must needs pass us toll-free. He is too like ourselves for us to make booty of him, since dogs should not worry dogs where wolves and foxes are to be found in abundance."</p> 
<p>"Like us?" answered one of the gang; "I should like to hear how that is made good."</p> 
<p>"Why, thou fool," answered the Captain, "is he not poor and disinherited as we are?---Doth he not win his substance at the sword's point as we do?---Hath he not beaten Front-de-Boeuf and Malvoisin, even as we would beat them if we could? Is he not the enemy to life and death of Brian de Bois-Guilbert, whom we have so much reason to fear? And were all this otherwise, wouldst thou have us show a worse conscience than an unbeliever, a Hebrew Jew?"</p> 
<p>"Nay, that were a shame," muttered the other fellow; "and yet, when I served in the band of stout old Gandelyn, we had no such scruples of conscience. And this insolent peasant,---he too, I warrant me, is to be dismissed scatheless?"</p> 
<p>"Not if THOU canst scathe him," replied the Captain.---"Here, fellow," continued he, addressing Gurth, "canst thou use the staff, that thou starts to it so readily?"</p> 
<p>"I think," said Gurth, "thou shouldst be best able to reply to that question."</p> 
<p>"Nay, by my troth, thou gavest me a round knock," replied the Captain; "do as much for this fellow, and thou shalt pass scot-free; and if thou dost not---why, by my faith, as thou art such a sturdy knave, I think I must pay thy ransom myself.---Take thy staff, Miller," he added, "and keep thy head; and do you others let the fellow go, and give him a staff---there is light enough to lay on load by."</p> 
<p>The two champions being alike armed with quarter-staves, stepped forward into the centre of the open space, in order to have the full benefit of the moonlight; the thieves in the meantime laughing, and crying to their comrade, "Miller! beware thy toll-dish." The Miller, on the other hand, holding his quarter-staff by the middle, and making it flourish round his head after the fashion which the French call "faire le moulinet", exclaimed boastfully, "Come on, churl, an thou darest: thou shalt feel the strength of a miller's thumb!"</p> 
<p>"If thou be'st a miller," answered Gurth, undauntedly, making his weapon play around his head with equal dexterity, "thou art doubly a thief, and I, as a true man, bid thee defiance."</p> 
<p>So saying, the two champions closed together, and for a few minutes they displayed great equality in strength, courage, and skill, intercepting and returning the blows of their adversary with the most rapid dexterity, while, from the continued clatter of their weapons, a person at a distance might have supposed that there were at least six persons engaged on each side. Less obstinate, and even less dangerous combats, have been described in good heroic verse; but that of Gurth and the Miller must remain unsung, for want of a sacred poet to do justice to its eventful progress. Yet, though quarter-staff play be out of date, what we can in prose we will do for these bold champions.</p> 
<p>Long they fought equally, until the Miller began to lose temper at finding himself so stoutly opposed, and at hearing the laughter of his companions, who, as usual in such cases, enjoyed his vexation. This was not a state of mind favourable to the noble game of quarter-staff, in which, as in ordinary cudgel-playing, the utmost coolness is requisite; and it gave Gurth, whose temper was steady, though surly, the opportunity of acquiring a decided advantage, in availing himself of which he displayed great mastery.</p> 
<p>The Miller pressed furiously forward, dealing blows with either end of his weapon alternately, and striving to come to half-staff distance, while Gurth defended himself against the attack, keeping his hands about a yard asunder, and covering himself by shifting his weapon with great celerity, so as to protect his head and body. Thus did he maintain the defensive, making his eye, foot, and hand keep true time, until, observing his antagonist to lose wind, he darted the staff at his face with his left hand; and, as the Miller endeavoured to parry the thrust, he slid his right hand down to his left, and with the full swing of the weapon struck his opponent on the left side of the head, who instantly measured his length upon the green sward.</p> 
<p>"Well and yeomanly done!" shouted the robbers; "fair play and Old England for ever! The Saxon hath saved both his purse and his hide, and the Miller has met his match."</p> 
<p>"Thou mayst go thy ways, my friend," said the Captain, addressing Gurth, in special confirmation of the general voice, "and I will cause two of my comrades to guide thee by the best way to thy master's pavilion, and to guard thee from night-walkers that might have less tender consciences than ours; for there is many one of them upon the amble in such a night as this. Take heed, however," he added sternly; "remember thou hast refused to tell thy name---ask not after ours, nor endeavour to discover who or what we are; for, if thou makest such an attempt, thou wilt come by worse fortune than has yet befallen thee."</p> 
<p>Gurth thanked the Captain for his courtesy, and promised to attend to his recommendation. Two of the outlaws, taking up their quarter-staves, and desiring Gurth to follow close in the rear, walked roundly forward along a by-path, which traversed the thicket and the broken ground adjacent to it. On the very verge of the thicket two men spoke to his conductors, and receiving an answer in a whisper, withdrew into the wood, and suffered them to pass unmolested. This circumstance induced Gurth to believe both that the gang was strong in numbers, and that they kept regular guards around their place of rendezvous.</p> 
<p>When they arrived on the open heath, where Gurth might have had some trouble in finding his road, the thieves guided him straight forward to the top of a little eminence, whence he could see, spread beneath him in the moonlight, the palisades of the lists, the glimmering pavilions pitched at either end, with the pennons which adorned them fluttering in the moonbeams, and from which could be heard the hum of the song with which the sentinels were beguiling their night-watch.</p> 
<p>Here the thieves stopt.</p> 
<p>"We go with you no farther," said they; "it were not safe that we should do so.---Remember the warning you have received---keep secret what has this night befallen you, and you will have no room to repent it---neglect what is now told you, and the Tower of London shall not protect you against our revenge."</p> 
<p>"Good night to you, kind sirs," said Gurth; "I shall remember your orders, and trust that there is no offence in wishing you a safer and an honester trade."</p> 
<p>Thus they parted, the outlaws returning in the direction from whence they had come, and Gurth proceeding to the tent of his master, to whom, notwithstanding the injunction he had received, he communicated the whole adventures of the evening.</p> 
<p>The Disinherited Knight was filled with astonishment, no less at the generosity of Rebecca, by which, however, he resolved he would not profit, than that of the robbers, to whose profession such a quality seemed totally foreign. His course of reflections upon these singular circumstances was, however, interrupted by the necessity for taking repose, which the fatigue of the preceding day, and the propriety of refreshing himself for the morrow's encounter, rendered alike indispensable.</p> 
<p>The knight, therefore, stretched himself for repose upon a rich couch with which the tent was provided; and the faithful Gurth, extending his hardy limbs upon a bear-skin which formed a sort of carpet to the pavilion, laid himself across the opening of the tent, so that no one could enter without awakening him.</p>

<p>《维洛那二绅士》(注)</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)莎士比亚的喜剧，引文见该剧第四幕第一场。</p> 
<p>葛四的黑夜冒险还没有结束；确实，到了镇外，走过一两所荒凉的小屋，进入一条深不见底的小巷以后，他自己也不免心里发怵；小巷两边的士坎上长满了高大的榛树和冬青，不时还有一两棵矮壮的栎树，伸出胳臂邀在道路上空。而且最近为比武大会运送各种物品的车子来来往往，把路面压得坎坷不平，尽是一条条车辙。土堤和树木又挡住了仲秋时节的月光，以致巷子里更显得阴森可怕。</p> 
<p>镇上饮酒作乐的声音从远处传来，不时还夹杂着疯狂的笑声，断断续续的尖叫和遥远的乐调发出的粗野节奏。这一切声响都让人想到镇上混乱嘈杂的状态，那里住满了军官、贵族和他们那些放荡的随从；葛四感到有些不安，在心里嘀咕：“犹太姑娘说得对，但愿上帝和圣邓斯坦保佑我一路平安，把这许多金币带到目的地！这种地方什么样的人都可能遇到，除了杀人越货的强盗，还有闯荡江湖的骑士和扈从，闯荡江湖的修士和吟游诗人，闯荡江湖的杂耍艺人和戏子小丑，一个人只要身边有那么几个钱。便难免遭到危险，何况我这个穷放猪的又带着整整一袋金币！但愿我快些走出这些该死的树荫，那么在圣尼古拉的徒弟(注)扑到我身上来以前，我至少可以先看到他！”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)据说，圣尼古拉是盗贼的保护神，因此“圣尼古拉的徒弟”习惯上即指盗贼。</p> 
<p>这样，葛四加紧了步子，想尽早走出巷子，来到空旷的平地上，可是他命中注定达不到这个目的。他刚走到巷子的另一头，从旁边茂密的矮树丛中蓦地跳出了四条大汉，而且正如他提心吊胆预料的，一边两个，从路两旁一下子扑到他身上，紧紧抓住了他，哪怕他想反抗，这时已经来不及了。“交出你的东西，”其中一个人说，“我们是劫富济贫的好汉，专门减轻每个人的负担的。”</p> 
<p>“你们要减轻我的负担可不那么容易，”葛四嘟哝道，他生性鲠直，哪怕刀架在脖子上也是不买账的，“只要我还有力气保护它，你们就休想得手。”</p> 
<p>“那就试试吧，”强盗说，又对他的伙伴道：“把这混蛋带走。我看他不光要丢掉他的钱袋，还想丢掉他的脑袋呢，那就让他两个一起丢吧。”</p> 
<p>葛四乖乖地接受了这判决，给架走了。在几个强盗的押送下，他趔趔趄趄地迈过小巷左边的堤岸，来到了位在小巷和空旷的公地之间一片稀疏的丛林中。粗暴的押送人不容分说，强迫他走进丛林深处，然后在一块不规则的空地上突然站住，这里的树木间隔较大，因此月光可以从树枝和树叶中间倾泻而下。这时又来了两个人，显然也是他们一伙的。他们佩着短剑，手里拿着铁头木棍，现在葛四可以看到，所有这六个人都戴着面罩，那么他们是于什么的就可想而知了，尽管起先他还有些怀疑。</p> 
<p>“乡巴佬，你有多少钱？”一个强盗问。</p> 
<p>“三十枚金币，是我自己的，”葛四理直气壮地回答。</p> 
<p>“这钱来路不明，”强盗们喊道，“一个撒克逊人带着三十枚金币，不去喝酒，却从镇上回家去！毫无疑问，应该立即没收他的全部财产。”</p> 
<p>“这是我的积蓄，预备赎身用的，我要自由，”葛四说。</p> 
<p>“你是一头蠢驴，”一个强盗答道，“三夸脱双料麦酒就可以使你像你的主人一样自由了，对，如果他像你一样是撒克逊人，你还可以比他更自由。”</p> 
<p>“这是个不幸的事实，”葛回答道，“不过如果这三十枚金币可以从你们手里赎回我的自由，你们放开我的手，我把这些钱给你们就是了。”</p> 
<p>“慢着，”一个人说，他似乎是这伙人的头头，“你的钱袋藏在大褂里面，我看得出来，它很沉，不止你讲的那个数目。”</p> 
<p>“那是杰出的骑士，我的主人的，”葛回答道，“我当然不必提到它们，因为你们要的只是我自己的财产。”</p> 
<p>“你很老实，我保证，”强盗答道。“我们对圣尼古拉本来并不怎么虔诚，只要你对我们老老实实，说不定连你的三十枚金币，我们也不要呢。现在，请你把你代管的钱袋暂时交给我。”他一边这么说，一边就从葛四胸口把那只皮制大钱包掏了出来，丽贝卡给他的钱袋便与其他金币一起，放在这包里。那个强盗继续询问：“你的主人是谁？”</p> 
<p>“剥夺继承权的骑士，”葛回答道。</p> 
<p>“今天在比武中赢得胜利的那个骑士？”强盗问。“他名叫什么，什么门第？”</p> 
<p>“他不愿公开他的姓名，”葛回答道，“当然，你们也甭想从我嘴里打听到什么。”</p> 
<p>“那么你自己的姓名和身分呢？”</p> 
<p>“这也不能告诉你，”葛四说，“否则就会暴露我主人的姓名了。”</p> 
<p>“你是个机灵的家伙，”强盗说，“不过这以后再讲。这些金币你的主人怎么弄到的？是他继承了财产，还是靠别的办法得到的？”</p> 
<p>“靠他的一枝枪得到的，”葛四答道。“这些袋子里装的是国匹战马和四套盔甲的赎金。”</p> 
<p>“一共多少数目？”强盗问。</p> 
<p>“两百枚金币。”</p> 
<p>“仅仅两百枚金币！”强盗说。“你的主人对待打败的人太大方了，让他们占了便宜。报一下付金币的人的姓名。”</p> 
<p>葛四照办了。</p> 
<p>“圣殿骑士布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔的战马和盔甲——它们是多少赎金？你瞧，你别想欺骗我。”</p> 
<p>“我的主人不要圣殿骑士的赎金，噶回答道，“只要他的性命。他们讲好要进行一场生死搏斗，没有别的交易可做。”</p> 
<p>“是啊！”强盗说，停了一会又重复了一遍。“那么你带着这些托你保管的钱，跑到阿什贝镇来干什么？”</p> 
<p>“我是上那儿找约克的犹太人以撒付钱的，”葛四答道，“那是一套盔甲的钱，也就是今天比武大会上我主人穿的那套，它是向犹太人借的。”</p> 
<p>“你付了以撒多少钱？从袋子的重量看，我想，那里面仍有两百枚金币呢。”</p> 
<p>“我付给了以撒八十枚金币，”撒克逊人说，“他又退回了我一百枚。”</p> 
<p>“怎么！什么！”所有的强盗异口同声喊了起来，“你敢跟我们开玩笑，拿这种混帐话糊弄我们？”</p> 
<p>“我讲的句句是真话，”葛四说，“真得像天上的月亮一样。你们瞧好了，皮钱包里还有一只丝钱袋，钱袋里就是那个数，它们跟其他金币不在一起。”</p> 
<p>“老兄，你倒想想，”头领说，“你讲的是一个犹太人，一个以色列人，他们像干燥的沙漠，旅人把一杯水泼在沙漠上，马上会给它吸干，犹太人也这样，他能把金币还给你吗？”</p> 
<p>“他们从来不发善心，”另一个强盗说，“就像税务官不会不受贿一样。”</p> 
<p>“不过我讲的都是真话，”葛四说。</p> 
<p>“马上点个火来，”头领说，“我得检查一下这只钱袋，如果真像这家伙说的，犹太人发了善心，那么这确实是奇迹，就像他们的祖先能从盘石里打出活命的水来一样(注)。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)以色列人逃出埃及时，到了旷野中没有水喝，口出怨言，摩西便用手中的枝击打盘石，盘石便流出了水来，见《约·出埃及记》第17章。</p> 
<p>于是火点亮了，那个强盗开始检查钱包。其余的人都围在他身边，甚至那两个抓住葛四的人也松了手，伸长脖子争看检查的结果。葛四利用他们没抓紧的机会，立即用足力气，挣脱了身子；他本可逃跑，要是他肯丢下主人的钱财不管，可是他不愿这么做，只从一个人手里夺下一根木棍，朝头领脑袋上打去，后者没有提防他这一着，差点给他抢走皮包和钱。不过这些强盗手脚麻利，立刻又抓住了忠心的葛四，夺回了钱袋。</p> 
<p>“混蛋！”头领说，从地上爬了起来，“你打破了我的头，这样的事要是犯在别人手里，他们就不会像我这么客气了。至于我们怎么对付你，你马上就会知道。首先让我们谈谈你的主人——按照骑士制度的法则，骑士问题得优先处理，然后解决扈从的事。现在请你站稳一些，如果你再胡来，我就叫你一辈子休想再动弹一下。伙计们！”他对着他的同伴们继续道，“这钱袋上绣着希伯来字，我完全相信这个乡巴佬讲的是真话。那个流浪的骑士，他的主人，可以不必在我们这儿留下买路钱。他与我们是同路人，我们不能剥夺他的钱财，因为同类不能互相残害，要知道，现在狼和狐狸还在我们周围为非作歹。”</p> 
<p>“同类人！”一个强盗开口道，“我倒想问问，这是什么道理。”</p> 
<p>“怎么，你这傻瓜，”头领答道，“他不是剥夺了继承权，与我们一样穷吗？他不是与我们一样，也得靠自己的剑维持生活吗？他不是打败了牛面将军和马尔沃辛，做了我们也要做的事吗？他与我们有充分理由害怕的布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔，不也是誓不两立的仇敌吗？要是这还不够，难道你要我们比一个不信基督的犹太佬良心更坏吗？”</p> 
<p>“当然不，那太丢脸了，”另一个人叨咕道，“不过从前我跟硬汉子老首迪林干的时候，我们从不讲什么良心。这个乡下人这么傲慢，难道我们不教训他一下，便放他走不成？”</p> 
<p>“那倒不是，只要你能教训他，”头领回答。接着他对葛四继续道：“喂，你这家伙，刚才你一下子就夺下了一根木棍，你能使不能使啊？”</p> 
<p>“我想，”葛四说，“这个问题最好问你自己。”</p> 
<p>“对，说实话，你给了我狠狠一棍，”头领答道，“现在你就给这家伙也来一下，如果得手，我们便放你过去，不难为你；如果赢不了，那么……可你是个死不服输的无赖，那么恐怕只得我替你付买路钱了。拿起你的棍子，磨坊老板(注)。”他又说，“保护好你的脑袋；还有你们这些人，放开那家伙，也给他一根木棍；好在这儿很亮，正可以让你们较量一番。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)这是罗宾汉一个伙伴的诨名，在有关罗宾汉的故事中屡屡提到，但真实姓名已无从查考。</p> 
<p>两个勇士同样拿起铁头木棍，跨前几步，走到了空地中央，那里月光照耀得如同白昼。其余的人嘻嘻哈哈，在旁边看热闹，一边朝他们的伙伴大喊：“磨坊老板，当心你的脑袋瓜子。”这时，磨坊老板已握住木棍中部，按照法国人所说的“风车方式”，把它在头顶上抡得转个不停，一边气势汹汹地大喊：“来吧，乡巴佬，有种的就上来，尝尝你磨坊老爷手上的力气！”</p> 
<p>“如果你真是磨坊老板，”葛四答道，毫不气馁，同样熟练地把木棍在头顶抢得刷刷直响，“那么你是双料的强盗，可我是个真正的人，根本不把你放在眼里。”</p> 
<p>两人一边呐喊，一边靠拢，打了几分钟谁也没有得手，从管力、勇气和武艺看都不分上下；他们一会儿招架，一会儿反击，两根棍子快得像飞一样，只听得它们噼噼啪啪的碰击声，要是有人站在远处，一定会以为至少边边都有六个人在对打。没这么顽强，甚至没这么危险的格斗，都得到了英雄诗篇的描绘，偏偏葛四和磨坊老板的这场鏖战却无人汇歌，这只因为还没有神圣的诗人对它千变万化的表现引起足够的重视。尽管木棍比武已不时兴(注)，我们还得竭尽所能，用散文为这两位勇敢的斗士作些记载。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)铁头木棍是英国农民的传统武器，以罗宾汉为首的侠盗大多出身农民，因此这成了他们的主要武器，每人几乎都随身携带。</p> 
<p>他们打了好久，还是不分胜负；磨坊老板发现自己遇到了旗鼓相当的敌手，又听得同伴们在取笑他——因为在这种场合，总是他越焦急，他们越觉得有趣——这样，他终于沉不住气，可是这种心情对高尚的木棍比武，也像对一般的棍棒比赛一样不利，这时绝对的冷静是必要的，这给了意志坚定，但相当沉着的葛四可乘之机，他的能耐也得到了充分发挥，以致他占了明显的优势。</p> 
<p>磨坊老板暴跳如雷，用木棍的两头轮流向前猛攻，竭力想使距离缩短到半根木棍那么长，可是葛四仍把握在木棍上的双手分开一码左右，一边挡住对方的攻击，一边用最快的速度旋转木棍，保护脑袋和身体。这样，他既达到了防御目的，又使他的眼睛和手脚保持着正确的节奏，终于看准对方的失着，用左手举起木棍朝他虚晃一记，趁磨坊老板急于挡开这一击的时机，把右手溜到左手那里，抡起整条木棍，使劲朝对方打去，从左边击中了他的脑袋，让他直挺挺地躺到了草地上。</p> 
<p>“打得好，像个英国农民！”强盗们齐声喝彩，“公平的比赛万岁！古老的英格兰万岁！这个撒克逊人保住了他的钱袋，也保住了他的脑袋，磨坊老板碰到对头啦。”</p> 
<p>“你可以走你的路了，朋友，”头领向葛四说，用这种特殊的方式对众人的欢呼表示了赞同，“我派两个伙计给你带路，让你可以尽快回到你主人的帐篷，同时也保护你，免得再遇到夜游神的袭击，要知道，有的人可不像我们这么慈悲心肠。在这种漆黑的夜里，到处都有那些人在溜达呢。不过，听着，”他又严厉地说，“请你记住，你没告诉我们你的名字，你也不要打听我们的名字，不要想知道我们是谁，是于什么的、如果你不听劝告，下次碰到我们，你就不会这么便宜了。”</p> 
<p>葛四感谢了头领的以礼相待，答应一定记住他的忠告。两个强盗拿了木棍，叮嘱葛四紧紧跟在他们后面，便迈开双腿，沿着一条小径朝前直走。小径得通过树丛和毗连的一块空地，在树丛边上，有两个人与向导小声谈了几句，听了回答，便返回树林，放他们通过了，没有难为他。这情形使葛四相信，他遇到的那伙强人力量很大，他们聚会的地点周围都布置着正规的岗哨。</p> 
<p>他们来到了一片野草丛生的荒原，要不是有人带路，葛四便可能迷失方向；这以后两个强盗领着他直奔一块高地，到了山顶，他已从月光中望见，比武场的栅栏铺展在他的脚下，场子两头的帐篷闪闪发亮，它们旁边的燕尾旗不断飘拂，还能隐隐听到，值夜的哨兵们为了消磨漫漫长夜低低哼唱的小曲。</p> 
<p>这时两个强盗站住了。</p> 
<p>“我们不再陪你朝前走了，”他们说，“否则就不安全了。记住我们给你的警告，对你今夜遇到的事必须严守秘密，免得后悔莫及；别把我们的话当作耳边风，要不，伦敦塔(注)也不能在我们的报复面前保护你。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)伦敦塔，英国的皇家要塞，威廉一世时开始兴建，十七世纪前一直为王室住地，戒备森严。</p> 
<p>“晚安，好心的朋友，”葛四说，“你们的嘱咐我会记住；相信我，我对你们并无恶意，只是希望你们能干些更安全、更有益的买卖。”</p> 
<p>他们就这样分手了，强盗从他们来的路上回去，葛四则朝他主人的帐篷直跑；不过尽管他接受过谆谆告诫，他还是把这晚上的全部经过告诉了他的主人。</p> 
<p>剥夺继承权的骑士听得目瞪口呆，然而丽贝卡的慷慨馈赠，他不打算接受，强盗们的宽宏大量也使他大惑不解，觉得这与他平素听到的他们的作为完全背道而驰。但是这些奇遇引起的思索没有继续下去，他必须好好休息，这对恢复一天的疲劳和养精蓄锐迎接明夭的战斗，都是不可缺少的。</p> 
<p>帐篷中设有一张华丽的卧榻，于是骑士躺下去休息了；忠实的葛四则在帐篷门口铺上一块熊皮，仿佛地毯似的，他便伸直劳累的四肢躺在那里，这样，任何人不惊醒他就无法入内。</p>
