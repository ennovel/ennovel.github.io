<p>Devotion borrows Music's tone, And Music took Devotion's wing; And, like the bird that hails the sun, They soar to heaven, and soaring sing. The Hermit of St Clement's Well</p> 
<p>It was after three hours' good walking that the servants of Cedric, with their mysterious guide, arrived at a small opening in the forest, in the centre of which grew an oak-tree of enormous magnitude, throwing its twisted branches in every direction. Beneath this tree four or five yeomen lay stretched on the ground, while another, as sentinel, walked to and fro in the moonlight shade.</p> 
<p>Upon hearing the sound of feet approaching, the watch instantly gave the alarm, and the sleepers as suddenly started up and bent their bows. Six arrows placed on the string were pointed towards the quarter from which the travellers approached, when their guide, being recognised, was welcomed with every token of respect and attachment, and all signs and fears of a rough reception at once subsided.</p> 
<p>"Where is the Miller?" was his first question.</p> 
<p>"On the road towards Rotherham."</p> 
<p>"With how many?" demanded the leader, for such he seemed to be.</p> 
<p>"With six men, and good hope of booty, if it please St Nicholas."</p> 
<p>"Devoutly spoken," said Locksley; "and where is Allan-a-Dale?"</p> 
<p>"Walked up towards the Watling-street, to watch for the Prior of Jorvaulx."</p> 
<p>"That is well thought on also," replied the Captain;---"and where is the Friar?"</p> 
<p>"In his cell."</p> 
<p>"Thither will I go," said Locksley. "Disperse and seek your companions. Collect what force you can, for there's game afoot that must be hunted hard, and will turn to bay. Meet me here by daybreak.---And stay," he added, "I have forgotten what is most necessary of the whole---Two of you take the road quickly towards Torquilstone, the Castle of Front-de-Boeuf. A set of gallants, who have been masquerading in such guise as our own, are carrying a band of prisoners thither---Watch them closely, for even if they reach the castle before we collect our force, our honour is concerned to punish them, and we will find means to do so. Keep a close watch on them therefore; and dispatch one of your comrades, the lightest of foot, to bring the news of the yeomen thereabout."</p> 
<p>They promised implicit obedience, and departed with alacrity on their different errands. In the meanwhile, their leader and his two companions, who now looked upon him with great respect, as well as some fear, pursued their way to the Chapel of Copmanhurst.</p> 
<p>When they had reached the little moonlight glade, having in front the reverend, though ruinous chapel, and the rude hermitage, so well suited to ascetic devotion, Wamba whispered to Gurth, "If this be the habitation of a thief, it makes good the old proverb, The nearer the church the farther from God.---And by my coxcomb," he added, "I think it be even so---Hearken but to the black sanctus which they are singing in the hermitage!"</p> 
<p>In fact the anchorite and his guest were performing, at the full extent of their very powerful lungs, an old drinking song, of which this was the burden:---</p> 
<p>"Come, trowl the brown bowl to me, Bully boy, bully boy, Come, trowl the brown bowl to me: Ho! jolly Jenkin, I spy a knave in drinking, Come, trowl the brown bowl to me."</p> 
<p>"Now, that is not ill sung," said Wamba, who had thrown in a few of his own flourishes to help out the chorus. "But who, in the saint's name, ever expected to have heard such a jolly chant come from out a hermit's cell at midnight!"</p> 
<p>"Marry, that should I," said Gurth, "for the jolly Clerk of Copmanhurst is a known man, and kills half the deer that are stolen in this walk. Men say that the keeper has complained to his official, and that he will be stripped of his cowl and cope altogether, if he keeps not better order."</p> 
<p>While they were thus speaking, Locksley's loud and repeated knocks had at length disturbed the anchorite and his guest. "By my beads," said the hermit, stopping short in a grand flourish, "here come more benighted guests. I would not for my cowl that they found us in this goodly exercise. All men have their enemies, good Sir Sluggard; and there be those malignant enough to construe the hospitable refreshment which I have been offering to you, a weary traveller, for the matter of three short hours, into sheer drunkenness and debauchery, vices alike alien to my profession and my disposition."</p> 
<p>"Base calumniators!" replied the knight; "I would I had the chastising of them. Nevertheless, Holy Clerk, it is true that all have their enemies; and there be those in this very land whom I would rather speak to through the bars of my helmet than barefaced."</p> 
<p>"Get thine iron pot on thy head then, friend Sluggard, as quickly as thy nature will permit," said the hermit, "while I remove these pewter flagons, whose late contents run strangely in mine own pate; and to drown the clatter---for, in faith, I feel somewhat unsteady---strike into the tune which thou hearest me sing; it is no matter for the words---I scarce know them myself."</p> 
<p>So saying, he struck up a thundering "De profundis clamavi", under cover of which he removed the apparatus of their banquet: while the knight, laughing heartily, and arming himself all the while, assisted his host with his voice from time to time as his mirth permitted.</p> 
<p>"What devil's matins are you after at this hour?" said a voice from without.</p> 
<p>"Heaven forgive you, Sir Traveller!" said the hermit, whose own noise, and perhaps his nocturnal potations, prevented from recognising accents which were tolerably familiar to him---"Wend on your way, in the name of God and Saint Dunstan, and disturb not the devotions of me and my holy brother."</p> 
<p>"Mad priest," answered the voice from without, "open to Locksley!"</p> 
<p>"All's safe---all's right," said the hermit to his companion.</p> 
<p>"But who is he?" said the Black Knight; "it imports me much to know."</p> 
<p>"Who is he?" answered the hermit; "I tell thee he is a friend."</p> 
<p>"But what friend?" answered the knight; "for he may be friend to thee and none of mine?"</p> 
<p>"What friend?" replied the hermit; "that, now, is one of the questions that is more easily asked than answered. What friend? ---why, he is, now that I bethink me a little, the very same honest keeper I told thee of a while since."</p> 
<p>"Ay, as honest a keeper as thou art a pious hermit," replied the knight, "I doubt it not. But undo the door to him before he beat it from its hinges."</p> 
<p>The dogs, in the meantime, which had made a dreadful baying at the commencement of the disturbance, seemed now to recognise the voice of him who stood without; for, totally changing their manner, they scratched and whined at the door, as if interceding for his admission. The hermit speedily unbolted his portal, and admitted Locksley, with his two companions.</p> 
<p>"Why, hermit," was the yeoman's first question as soon as he beheld the knight, "what boon companion hast thou here?"</p> 
<p>"A brother of our order," replied the friar, shaking his head; "we have been at our orisons all night."</p> 
<p>"He is a monk of the church militant, I think," answered Locksley; "and there be more of them abroad. I tell thee, friar, thou must lay down the rosary and take up the quarter-staff; we shall need every one of our merry men, whether clerk or layman. ---But," he added, taking him a step aside, "art thou mad? to give admittance to a knight thou dost not know? Hast thou forgot our articles?"</p> 
<p>"Not know him!" replied the friar, boldly, "I know him as well as the beggar knows his dish."</p> 
<p>"And what is his name, then?" demanded Locksley.</p> 
<p>"His name," said the hermit---"his name is Sir Anthony of Scrabelstone---as if I would drink with a man, and did not know his name!"</p> 
<p>"Thou hast been drinking more than enough, friar," said the woodsman, "and, I fear, prating more than enough too."</p> 
<p>"Good yeoman," said the knight, coming forward, "be not wroth with my merry host. He did but afford me the hospitality which I would have compelled from him if he had refused it."</p> 
<p>"Thou compel!" said the friar; "wait but till have changed this grey gown for a green cassock, and if I make not a quarter-staff ring twelve upon thy pate, I am neither true clerk nor good woodsman."</p> 
<p>While he spoke thus, he stript off his gown, and appeared in a close black buckram doublet and drawers, over which he speedily did on a cassock of green, and hose of the same colour. "I pray thee truss my points," said he to Wamba, "and thou shalt have a cup of sack for thy labour."</p> 
<p>"Gramercy for thy sack," said Wamba; "but think'st thou it is lawful for me to aid you to transmew thyself from a holy hermit into a sinful forester?"</p> 
<p>"Never fear," said the hermit; "I will but confess the sins of my green cloak to my greyfriar's frock, and all shall be well again."</p> 
<p>"Amen!" answered the Jester; "a broadcloth penitent should have a sackcloth confessor, and your frock may absolve my motley doublet into the bargain."</p> 
<p>So saying, he accommodated the friar with his assistance in tying the endless number of points, as the laces which attached the hose to the doublet were then termed.</p> 
<p>While they were thus employed, Locksley led the knight a little apart, and addressed him thus:---"Deny it not, Sir Knight---you are he who decided the victory to the advantage of the English against the strangers on the second day of the tournament at Ashby."</p> 
<p>"And what follows if you guess truly, good yeoman?" replied the knight.</p> 
<p>"I should in that case hold you," replied the yeoman, "a friend to the weaker party."</p> 
<p>"Such is the duty of a true knight at least," replied the Black Champion; "and I would not willingly that there were reason to think otherwise of me."</p> 
<p>"But for my purpose," said the yeoman, "thou shouldst be as well a good Englishman as a good knight; for that, which I have to speak of, concerns, indeed, the duty of every honest man, but is more especially that of a true-born native of England."</p> 
<p>"You can speak to no one," replied the knight, "to whom England, and the life of every Englishman, can be dearer than to me."</p> 
<p>"I would willingly believe so," said the woodsman, "for never had this country such need to be supported by those who love her. Hear me, and I will tell thee of an enterprise, in which, if thou be'st really that which thou seemest, thou mayst take an honourable part. A band of villains, in the disguise of better men than themselves, have made themselves master of the person of a noble Englishman, called Cedric the Saxon, together with his ward, and his friend Athelstane of Coningsburgh, and have transported them to a castle in this forest, called Torquilstone. I ask of thee, as a good knight and a good Englishman, wilt thou aid in their rescue?"</p> 
<p>"I am bound by my vow to do so," replied the knight; "but I would willingly know who you are, who request my assistance in their behalf?"</p> 
<p>"I am," said the forester, "a nameless man; but I am the friend of my country, and of my country's friends---With this account of me you must for the present remain satisfied, the more especially since you yourself desire to continue unknown. Believe, however, that my word, when pledged, is as inviolate as if I wore golden spurs."</p> 
<p>"I willingly believe it," said the knight; "I have been accustomed to study men's countenances, and I can read in thine honesty and resolution. I will, therefore, ask thee no further questions, but aid thee in setting at freedom these oppressed captives; which done, I trust we shall part better acquainted, and well satisfied with each other."</p> 
<p>"So," said Wamba to Gurth,---for the friar being now fully equipped, the Jester, having approached to the other side of the hut, had heard the conclusion of the conversation,---"So we have got a new ally?---l trust the valour of the knight will be truer metal than the religion of the hermit, or the honesty of the yeoman; for this Locksley looks like a born deer-stealer, and the priest like a lusty hypocrite."</p> 
<p>"Hold thy peace, Wamba," said Gurth; "it may all be as thou dost guess; but were the horned devil to rise and proffer me his assistance to set at liberty Cedric and the Lady Rowena, I fear I should hardly have religion enough to refuse the foul fiend's offer, and bid him get behind me."</p> 
<p>The friar was now completely accoutred as a yeoman, with sword and buckler, bow, and quiver, and a strong partisan over his shoulder. He left his cell at the head of the party, and, having carefully locked the door, deposited the key under the threshold.</p> 
<p>"Art thou in condition to do good service, friar," said Locksley, "or does the brown bowl still run in thy head?"</p> 
<p>"Not more than a drought of St Dunstan's fountain will allay," answered the priest; "something there is of a whizzing in my brain, and of instability in my legs, but you shall presently see both pass away."</p> 
<p>So saying, he stepped to the stone basin, in which the waters of the fountain as they fell formed bubbles which danced in the white moonlight, and took so long a drought as if he had meant to exhaust the spring.</p> 
<p>"When didst thou drink as deep a drought of water before, Holy Clerk of Copmanhurst?" said the Black Knight.</p> 
<p>"Never since my wine-butt leaked, and let out its liquor by an illegal vent," replied the friar, "and so left me nothing to drink but my patron's bounty here."</p> 
<p>Then plunging his hands and head into the fountain, he washed from them all marks of the midnight revel.</p> 
<p>Thus refreshed and sobered, the jolly priest twirled his heavy partisan round his head with three fingers, as if he had been balancing a reed, exclaiming at the same time, "Where be those false ravishers, who carry off wenches against their will? May the foul fiend fly off with me, if I am not man enough for a dozen of them."</p> 
<p>"Swearest thou, Holy Clerk?" said the Black Knight.</p> 
<p>"Clerk me no Clerks," replied the transformed priest; "by Saint George and the Dragon, I am no longer a shaveling than while my frock is on my back---When I am cased in my green cassock, I will drink, swear, and woo a lass, with any blithe forester in the West Riding."</p> 
<p>"Come on, Jack Priest," said Locksley, "and be silent; thou art as noisy as a whole convent on a holy eve, when the Father Abbot has gone to bed.---Come on you, too, my masters, tarry not to talk of it---I say, come on, we must collect all our forces, and few enough we shall have, if we are to storm the Castle of Reginald Front-de-Boeuf."</p> 
<p>"What! is it Front-de-Boeuf," said the Black Knight, "who has stopt on the king's highway the king's liege subjects?---Is he turned thief and oppressor?"</p> 
<p>"Oppressor he ever was," said Locksley.</p> 
<p>"And for thief," said the priest, "I doubt if ever he were even half so honest a man as many a thief of my acquaintance."</p> 
<p>"Move on, priest, and be silent," said the yeoman; "it were better you led the way to the place of rendezvous, than say what should be left unsaid, both in decency and prudence."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>在漫长而忧郁的秋夜，</p> 
<p>森林的道路模糊而黑暗，</p> 
<p>这时隐士的琅琅诵经声</p> 
<p>在寂寞的旅人耳边多么甜蜜！</p> 
<p>信仰借助于音乐的旋律，</p> 
<p>音乐长出了信仰的翅膀，</p> 
<p>它们像飞鸟迎着阳光欢呼，</p> 
<p>在空中翱翔盘旋飞上云霄。</p> 
<p>《圣克莱门泉的隐士》</p> 
<p>经过三个小时的步行之后，塞德里克的两个仆人和他们的神秘向导，到达了林中一块小小的空地，空地中央矗立着一棵雄伟粗壮的栎树，交叉的枝叶伸向四周，覆盖着地面。四五个庄稼人伸直身子，躺在树荫下。另一个人像是放哨的，在腰陇的月光下踱来踱去。</p> 
<p>听到行近的脚步声，岗哨立刻发出了警告，躺着的人一下子站了起来，拿起了弓箭。六支箭搭上弓弦，瞄准了来人的方向，但当他们认出向导以后，立刻变得欢欣鼓舞，用又恭敬又热情的态度迎接他；这样，担心遭到粗暴接待的一切疑虑，顿时烟消云散了。</p> 
<p>“磨坊主在哪儿？”是他的第一个问题。</p> 
<p>“他已去了罗瑟勒姆。”</p> 
<p>“带了多少人去？”向导问，看来他是个领导人。</p> 
<p>“带了六个人，如果圣尼古拉保佑，一定可以满载而归。”</p> 
<p>“有信心就好，”洛克斯利说。“阿伦阿代尔在哪里？”</p> 
<p>“上沃特林大道一带，侦察茹尔沃长老的行踪了。”</p> 
<p>“那也考虑得不错，”首领道。“修士在哪儿？”</p> 
<p>“在他自己的小屋里。”</p> 
<p>“那么我到那儿去，”洛克斯利说。“你们分头找各自的伙伴，尽量多召集一些人，因为有一笔大买卖要做，必须花些力气，才能旗开得胜。拂晓前在这儿与我会合。哦，且慢，”他又说，“我忘了一件最必要的事。你们两个马上出发，前往牛面将军的城堡托奎尔斯通走一趟。一伙武土改扮成我们的模样，正把一批俘虏送往耶里。密切监视他们，因为哪怕在我们的力量集结以前．他们到达了城堡，我们也得惩罚他们，这事有关我们的名誉，我们必须设法做到这点。要对他们进行严密的监视，还有，你们得分出一个伙计，要跑得最快的，打听一下那一带老乡的情形，马上向我报告。”</p> 
<p>他们保证绝对照办，便带着各自的任务飞也似的走了、与此同时，他们的首领，以及那两个现在已对他刮目相看，又敬又怕的同伴，也《即出发，火速赶往科普曼赫斯特的隐修所了。</p> 
<p>不久他们便来到了月光下的那一小块空地，看到了神圣而破旧的礼拜堂和简陋的隐修所，那确实像是与肚隔绝、刻苦修炼的地方，于是汪八小声对葛四说道：“如果这是一个强盗的住处，那么占话说得真不错：‘离教堂越近，离上帝越远’。我可以凭我的小丑帽子起誓，这句话用在这里甚至更合适。你听听，他们在隐修所里唱的是什么乌七八糟的赞美歌！”</p> 
<p>真的，隐士和他的客人正拉开粗壮的大嗓门，唱一支古老的饮酒歌，它一再反复的便是这几句：</p> 
<p>来吧，用大碗斟满了酒传给我，</p> 
<p>乖乖的小伙子哟小伙子，</p> 
<p>来吧，用大碗斟满了酒传给我，</p> 
<p>快活的浑小子哟，别跟我喝酒耍无赖，</p> 
<p>来吧，用大碗斟满了酒传给我。</p> 
<p>“哟，这歌唱得不赖，”汪八说，也随声哼了几句花腔。“但是我得用圣徒的名字起誓，在隐士的修炼室里，谁能料到，深更半夜会这么喝酒作乐，大声唱歌！”</p> 
<p>“得啦，不必大惊小怪，”葛四说道，“大家知道，科普曼赫斯特的教士一向无拘无束，这一带偷猎的鹿，一半死在他的手里。人们说，护林人向上司告过他的状，如果他再不改正，非把他的头巾和法衣剥掉不可。”</p> 
<p>他们这么谈论的时候，洛克斯利的大声喊叫和一再打门，终于把隐土和他的客人从欢乐中惊醒了。“凭我的念珠起誓，”隐士说，赶紧煞住了一声洪亮的花腔，“又有客人要来过夜了。我是修土，可不能让他们看到我们干的好事。懒汉老弟，每人都有他的对头；有的还心肠恶毒，我不过因为你赶路累了，招待你吃了三个钟头酒菜，他们便会造谣生事，把这说成纵酒行乐，胡作非为，仿佛这是违背我的职业和人品的罪恶。</p> 
<p>“这些胡说八道的小人！”骑士答道，“我恨不得用鞭子抽他们一顿、不过，神父，你说得对，每个人都有他的对头；在这片土地上也有不少人，我宁可通过我头盔上的铁条跟他们讲话．不想让他们看到我的真面目</p> 
<p>“那就把你的铁罐子戴上吧，懒汉老弟，别再磨蹭，尽量快一些，”隐士说，“让我来收拾这些酒器；不知怎么回事，那些酒好像都跑进了我的脑袋，说真的，它变得迷迷糊糊的。喂，请你还是跟我一起唱的好，唱响一些．免得让人听到瓶瓶罐罐的碰击声。唱什么无关紧要，连我自己也不知唱什么好呢。”</p> 
<p>这么说着，他便拉开嗓子，跟打雷似的唱起了“我从深渊向你求告”(注)，同时在歌声的掩盖下收拾餐桌L的用具。骑士放声大笑，一边趁这时机把帽盔脸甲全都戴好，一边尽可能不时忍住笑，用他的大嗓门给主人帮腔。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)基督教的赞美诗，见《旧约·诗篇》第130篇。</p> 
<p>“这个时候，你在念什么鬼祷告？”门外的声音问。</p> 
<p>“愿上帝宽恕你，旅客先生！”隐土答道；他自己的喊声，也许还有这一夜喝的酒，使他不能听出这个对他相当熟悉的嗓音。“我以上帝和圣邓斯坦的名义，请你走自己的路吧，别来打扰我和我的修士兄弟的祈祷。”</p> 
<p>“这教士发疯了，”门外的声音说道，“开门，我是洛克斯利！”</p> 
<p>“这下可以放心了，什么事也没有，”隐士对他的同伴说。</p> 
<p>“但他是准呀？”黑甲骑士说，“这跟我关系重大，必须知道。”</p> 
<p>“他是谁！”隐士答道，“我告诉你，他是一个朋友。”</p> 
<p>“但是什么朋友？”骑士问道，“因为他可能是你的朋友，却不是我的朋＆、”</p> 
<p>“什么朋友！”隐士答道，“这个问题要问是容易的，回答却不容易。什么朋友！好吧，他是……让我想想，对，就是刚才我告诉你的，那个正直的守林人。”</p> 
<p>“对，跟你一样，你是虔诚的修士，他是正直的守林人，”骑士答道．“这点毫无疑问、但你还是把门打开吧，免得他把铰链踢断。”</p> 
<p>这时，在交涉开始的时候叫得那么可怕的两条狗，似乎也听出了门外那个人的声合，态度骤然变了，一边用爪子扒门，一边发出伤心的吠叫，仿佛在为他求情，要放他进屋。隐士马上拔掉门闩，让洛克斯利和他的两个伙伴进了屋子。</p> 
<p>“怎么，隐士，”庄稼汉一看见骑士，便提出了这个问题，“这就是跟你一起唱歌喝酒的朋友？他是谁？”</p> 
<p>“我们修会的一个兄弟，”修上答道，摇了摇头，“我们在这儿做了一夜祷告。”</p> 
<p>“我想，他是军队修会的修上吧，”洛克斯利答道，“这样的人外面有的是，找告诉你，修士，你得放下念珠，拿起棍子来了；我们必须把我们快活的小伙产全都召集拢来，不沦他是出家的还是在家的。不过，”他又说，把他拉到一边，“你疯了不是？让一个不认识的骑士进入你的屋里？你忘记了我们的规则吗？”</p> 
<p>“不认识！”修士勇敢地答道，“我完全认识他，就像乞丐认识自己的盘子一样”</p> 
<p>“那么他叫什么名字？”洛克斯利问。</p> 
<p>“他名叫……”隐士道，“他是斯克兰布尔修道院的安东尼兄弟；你以为我会跟一个我不知道姓名的人喝酒不成！”</p> 
<p>“你已经喝得太多了，修士。”庄稼人说，“恐怕还唠唠叨叨讲了不少不该讲的话。”</p> 
<p>“好庄户人，”骑士上前说道，“别跟我这位快活的主人生气。他只是请我吃了一顿饭，其实如果他不肯，我也会强迫他请的。”</p> 
<p>“你强迫我！”修士说道。“等着瞧吧，等我脱下这身灰布衣服，换上绿色大褂，拿起铁头木棍，我不把你打得屁滚尿流，就算不得真修士，也算不得好猎手。”</p> 
<p>他一边说，一边脱下了长袍，露出了紧身粗布黑上衣和裤子，随即穿上了绿大褂和同样颜色的罩裤。“请你帮个忙，给我把这些带子缚紧，”他讨汪八说，“我可以赏你一杯葡萄酒，不会要你白干的。”</p> 
<p>“多谢您老啦，”汪八答道，“不过要我帮助你把一个修士变成强盗，这么做个犯法吗？”</p> 
<p>“别怕，”隐士说，“我穿了绿大褂犯的罪，会向我穿了灰大褂的修士忏悔，于是一切便会逢凶化吉。”</p> 
<p>“那敢情好！”小丑答道，“粗布大褂犯了罪有麻布大褂替他仔悔，那个穿小丑彩衣的我干了坏事，也可以靠穿修士长袍的您老给消灾除祸啦。。</p> 
<p>他一边说，一边帮修士把联结上衣和裤子的无数条带子—一缚紧。</p> 
<p>他们这么干时，洛克斯利把骑士叫到一旁，对他说道：“不要否认，骑士先生，你便是在阿什贝的第二天比武中，帮助英国人一边打败外国人的那个人。”</p> 
<p>“我的朋友，如果你猜得不错，那怎么样呢？”骑士问。</p> 
<p>“那么我就认为，你是弱者的朋友，”庄稼汉答道。</p> 
<p>“这本来是一个真正的骑士的起码职责，”黑甲勇士回答，“我自然不愿意别人不这么看我。”</p> 
<p>“不过根据我的看法，”庄稼人说，“你不仅应该作一个合格的骑士．也应该作一个合格的英国人；因为我现在要谈的那件事，的确是每个正直的人都责无旁贷的，但一个真正出生在英国的人责任尤其重大。”</p> 
<p>“没有一个人会比我更重视英国的利益，更关心每一个英国人的生命，你放心讲好了，”骑士答道。</p> 
<p>“这正是我希望相信的事，”乡下人说，“因为这个国家还从没像现在这样，需要得到爱护它的人的支持。听我说，现在有一件大事需要我们去做，如果你真像你所说的那样，你也可以参加这个光荣的行动。一群歹徒装扮成比他们高尚的人，抓走了一个被人称作撒克逊人塞德里克的正直的英国人，以及他的义女，他的一个朋友科宁斯堡的阿特尔斯坦，把他们关进了这片森林中的托奎尔斯通城堡。你作为一个善良的骑士和善良的英国人，我问你，你愿意出力搭救他们吗？”</p> 
<p>“根据我的誓言，我应该这么做，”骑上回答，“但是你要求我帮助他们，我希望知道你是谁？”</p> 
<p>“我只是一个无名小子，”庄稼人说，“但我是我的国家的朋友，我的国家的朋友的朋友。我只能讲到这里为止，你不必再追问，尤其因为你自己也还不愿公开姓名。然而请你相信，我的话是算数的，是像骑士的誓言一样可靠的。”</p> 
<p>“我完全相信这点，”骑士说，“我一向善于观察人们的脸，从你的脸上我看到了正直和坚定。因此我不想再提出任何问题，我愿意帮助你．让那些受到欺压的俘虏获得自由；等那事完成后，我相信我们会获得进一步的了解，彼此感到满意的。”</p> 
<p>这时修士在汪八的帮助下，装束完毕。小丑走到屋子的另一头，听到了谈话的结果，便对岛四说道：“那么我们又找到一个帮手了？我相信，骑上的勇敢是比隐士的祈祷和庄稼汉的正直支有用的；因为洛克斯利这家伙像专在树林里打鹿的惯偷，那个修士又像不守清现的伪君子。”</p> 
<p>“别多嘴，汪八，”葛回答道，“一切也许正像你猜的那样，不过要是魔鬼对付我说，他愿意帮忙，搭救塞德里戈和罗文娜小姐，我恐怕也不会为了信仰上帝，便拒绝魔鬼的帮助，要他别管我的事。”</p> 
<p>现在修上已完全打扮成庄稼汉，拿着刀和盾牌，背着弓箭，还扛了一把粗大的戟。他领着这伙人走出屋子，小心翼翼锁上了门，把钥匙藏在了门槛下。</p> 
<p>“你现在的情况怎么样，那一大碗一大碗酒是不是还在你的头脑里作怪？”洛克斯利说。</p> 
<p>“只要再喝一口圣邓斯坦的泉水便没事了，”教士答道。“我的头脑还在嗡嗡响，腿也有些发软，但是你瞧吧，一切马上都会过去。”</p> 
<p>说着，他走向石盂，泉水落下时形成的水泡，正在清澈的月光下跳动，他俯下身子，长长地喝了一大口，仿佛要把一盆水都喝干似的。</p> 
<p>“你恐怕从没一口喝过这么多水吧，我的科普曼赫斯特的教土？”黑甲骑土说道。</p> 
<p>“不对，有一次我的酒桶漏了，酒都从那个非法孔道溜走了，我什么也喝不到，只得靠我的保护圣徒的施舍过日子，那时我一口也喝过这么多，”修士答道。</p> 
<p>然后他把手和头都伸进泉水中，洗净了夜间大吃大喝留下的一切痕迹。</p> 
<p>现在快活的修士终于清醒了，显得神采奕奕，像拿一根芦杆似的，用二只手指提起那把笨重的大戟，在头顶挥了三圈，一边还大声嚷嚷：“那几个强抢妇女的混帐暴徒在哪里？要是我一个对付不了他们十个，我他妈的就是魔鬼的孙子！”</p> 
<p>“神父，你也要骂人？”黑甲骑士说。</p> 
<p>“别叫我神父，”那个换了装束的教士答道，“凭圣乔治和白龙起誓，我口有穿上灰布道袍的时候，才是削发的僧侣。只要我穿上绿大褂，我便与这西区森林里任何一个快活的伙伴一样，也要喝酒，骂人，追求姑娘。”</p> 
<p>“走吧，别胡闹了。”洛克斯利说，“‘安静一些，你哇啦哇啦的，吵得比节日夜里长老睡觉以后的整个修道院还热闹。你们各位也请。快走，别慢吞吞的，只顾讲话；真的，得走快些，我们必须集合所有的力量，人手越多越好．山为这是要攻打牛面将军雷金纳德的城堡呢。”</p> 
<p>“什么！那是牛面将军？”黑甲骑十说，“他竟然在大路上打劫国王的臣民？他真的成了贼人，欺压平民不成？”</p> 
<p>“他一贯欺压平民，”洛克斯利说。</p> 
<p>“至于贼人，”教土道，“告诉你，他比我认识的许多强盗还坏一倍。”</p> 
<p>“神父，快走，别再讲话．”庄稼人说。“你最好还是在前面带路，把大伙领往集合地点；凡是不该讲的话就别讲，应该庄重一些．谨慎一些。”</p>
