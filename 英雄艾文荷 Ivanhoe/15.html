Atrides thus aloud, "Stand forth distinguish'd from the circling crowd, Ye who by skill or manly force may claim, Your rivals to surpass and merit fame. This cow, worth twenty oxen, is decreed, For him who farthest sends the winged reed." Iliad</p> 
<p>The name of Ivanhoe was no sooner pronounced than it flew from mouth to mouth, with all the celerity with which eagerness could convey and curiosity receive it. It was not long ere it reached the circle of the Prince, whose brow darkened as he heard the news. Looking around him, however, with an air of scorn, "My Lords," said he, "and especially you, Sir Prior, what think ye of the doctrine the learned tell us, concerning innate attractions and antipathies? Methinks that I felt the presence of my brother's minion, even when I least guessed whom yonder suit of armour enclosed."</p> 
<p>"Front-de-Boeuf must prepare to restore his fief of Ivanhoe," said De Bracy, who, having discharged his part honourably in the tournament, had laid his shield and helmet aside, and again mingled with the Prince's retinue.</p> 
<p>"Ay," answered Waldemar Fitzurse, "this gallant is likely to reclaim the castle and manor which Richard assigned to him, and which your Highness's generosity has since given to Front-de-Boeuf."</p> 
<p>"Front-de-Boeuf," replied John, "is a man more willing to swallow three manors such as Ivanhoe, than to disgorge one of them. For the rest, sirs, I hope none here will deny my right to confer the fiefs of the crown upon the faithful followers who are around me, and ready to perform the usual military service, in the room of those who have wandered to foreign Countries, and can neither render homage nor service when called upon."</p> 
<p>The audience were too much interested in the question not to pronounce the Prince's assumed right altogether indubitable. "A generous Prince!---a most noble Lord, who thus takes upon himself the task of rewarding his faithful followers!"</p> 
<p>Such were the words which burst from the train, expectants all of them of similar grants at the expense of King Richard's followers and favourites, if indeed they had not as yet received such. Prior Aymer also assented to the general proposition, observing, however, "That the blessed Jerusalem could not indeed be termed a foreign country. She was 'communis mater'---the mother of all Christians. But he saw not," he declared, "how the Knight of Ivanhoe could plead any advantage from this, since he" (the Prior) "was assured that the crusaders, under Richard, had never proceeded much farther than Askalon, which, as all the world knew, was a town of the Philistines, and entitled to none of the privileges of the Holy City."</p> 
<p>Waldemar, whose curiosity had led him towards the place where Ivanhoe had fallen to the ground, now returned. "The gallant," said he, "is likely to give your Highness little disturbance, and to leave Front-de-Boeuf in the quiet possession of his gains--he is severely wounded."</p> 
<p>"Whatever becomes of him," said Prince John, "he is victor of the day; and were he tenfold our enemy, or the devoted friend of our brother, which is perhaps the same, his wounds must be looked to ---our own physician shall attend him."</p> 
<p>A stern smile curled the Prince's lip as he spoke. Waldemar Fitzurse hastened to reply, that Ivanhoe was already removed from the lists, and in the custody of his friends.</p> 
<p>"I was somewhat afflicted," he said, "to see the grief of the Queen of Love and Beauty, whose sovereignty of a day this event has changed into mourning. I am not a man to be moved by a woman's lament for her lover, but this same Lady Rowena suppressed her sorrow with such dignity of manner, that it could only be discovered by her folded hands, and her tearless eye, which trembled as it remained fixed on the lifeless form before her."</p> 
<p>"Who is this Lady Rowena," said Prince John, "of whom we have heard so much?"</p> 
<p>"A Saxon heiress of large possessions," replied the Prior Aymer; "a rose of loveliness, and a jewel of wealth; the fairest among a thousand, a bundle of myrrh, and a cluster of camphire."</p> 
<p>"We shall cheer her sorrows," said Prince John, "and amend her blood, by wedding her to a Norman. She seems a minor, and must therefore be at our royal disposal in marriage.---How sayst thou, De Bracy? What thinkst thou of gaining fair lands and livings, by wedding a Saxon, after the fashion of the followers of the Conqueror?"</p> 
<p>"If the lands are to my liking, my lord," answered De Bracy, "it will be hard to displease me with a bride; and deeply will I hold myself bound to your highness for a good deed, which will fulfil all promises made in favour of your servant and vassal."</p> 
<p>"We will not forget it," said Prince John; "and that we may instantly go to work, command our seneschal presently to order the attendance of the Lady Rowena and her company---that is, the rude churl her guardian, and the Saxon ox whom the Black Knight struck down in the tournament, upon this evening's banquet.---De Bigot," he added to his seneschal, "thou wilt word this our second summons so courteously, as to gratify the pride of these Saxons, and make it impossible for them again to refuse; although, by the bones of Becket, courtesy to them is casting pearls before swine."</p> 
<p>Prince John had proceeded thus far, and was about to give the signal for retiring from the lists, when a small billet was put into his hand.</p> 
<p>"From whence?" said Prince John, looking at the person by whom it was delivered.</p> 
<p>"From foreign parts, my lord, but from whence I know not" replied his attendant. "A Frenchman brought it hither, who said, he had ridden night and day to put it into the hands of your highness."</p> 
<p>The Prince looked narrowly at the superscription, and then at the seal, placed so as to secure the flex-silk with which the billet was surrounded, and which bore the impression of three fleurs-de-lis. John then opened the billet with apparent agitation, which visibly and greatly increased when he had perused the contents, which were expressed in these words:</p> 
<p>"Take heed to yourself for the Devil is unchained!"</p> 
<p>The Prince turned as pale as death, looked first on the earth, and then up to heaven, like a man who has received news that sentence of execution has been passed upon him. Recovering from the first effects of his surprise, he took Waldemar Fitzurse and De Bracy aside, and put the billet into their hands successively. "It means," he added, in a faltering voice, "that my brother Richard has obtained his freedom."</p> 
<p>"This may be a false alarm, or a forged letter," said De Bracy.</p> 
<p>"It is France's own hand and seal," replied Prince John.</p> 
<p>"It is time, then," said Fitzurse, "to draw our party to a head, either at York, or some other centrical place. A few days later, and it will be indeed too late. Your highness must break short this present mummery."</p> 
<p>"The yeomen and commons," said De Bracy, "must not be dismissed discontented, for lack of their share in the sports."</p> 
<p>"The day," said Waldemar, "is not yet very far spent---let the archers shoot a few rounds at the target, and the prize be adjudged. This will be an abundant fulfilment of the Prince's promises, so far as this herd of Saxon serfs is concerned."</p> 
<p>"I thank thee, Waldemar," said the Prince; "thou remindest me, too, that I have a debt to pay to that insolent peasant who yesterday insulted our person. Our banquet also shall go forward to-night as we proposed. Were this my last hour of power, it should be an hour sacred to revenge and to pleasure---let new cares come with to-morrow's new day."</p> 
<p>The sound of the trumpets soon recalled those spectators who had already begun to leave the field; and proclamation was made that Prince John, suddenly called by high and peremptory public duties, held himself obliged to discontinue the entertainments of to-morrow's festival: Nevertheless, that, unwilling so many good yeoman should depart without a trial of skill, he was pleased to appoint them, before leaving the ground, presently to execute the competition of archery intended for the morrow. To the best archer a prize was to be awarded, being a bugle-horn, mounted with silver, and a silken baldric richly ornamented with a medallion of St Hubert, the patron of silvan sport.</p> 
<p>More than thirty yeomen at first presented themselves as competitors, several of whom were rangers and under-keepers in the royal forests of Needwood and Charnwood. When, however, the archers understood with whom they were to be matched, upwards of twenty withdrew themselves from the contest, unwilling to encounter the dishonour of almost certain defeat. For in those days the skill of each celebrated marksman was as well known for many miles round him, as the qualities of a horse trained at Newmarket are familiar to those who frequent that well-known meeting.</p> 
<p>The diminished list of competitors for silvan fame still amounted to eight. Prince John stepped from his royal seat to view more nearly the persons of these chosen yeomen, several of whom wore the royal livery. Having satisfied his curiosity by this investigation, he looked for the object of his resentment, whom he observed standing on the same spot, and with the same composed countenance which he had exhibited upon the preceding day.</p> 
<p>"Fellow," said Prince John, "I guessed by thy insolent babble that thou wert no true lover of the longbow, and I see thou darest not adventure thy skill among such merry-men as stand yonder."</p> 
<p>"Under favour, sir," replied the yeoman, "I have another reason for refraining to shoot, besides the fearing discomfiture and disgrace."</p> 
<p>"And what is thy other reason?" said Prince John, who, for some cause which perhaps he could not himself have explained, felt a painful curiosity respecting this individual.</p> 
<p>"Because," replied the woodsman, "I know not if these yeomen and I are used to shoot at the same marks; and because, moreover, I know not how your Grace might relish the winning of a third prize by one who has unwittingly fallen under your displeasure."</p> 
<p>Prince John coloured as he put the question, "What is thy name, yeoman?"</p> 
<p>"Locksley," answered the yeoman.</p> 
<p>"Then, Locksley," said Prince John, "thou shalt shoot in thy turn, when these yeomen have displayed their skill. If thou carriest the prize, I will add to it twenty nobles; but if thou losest it, thou shalt be stript of thy Lincoln green, and scourged out of the lists with bowstrings, for a wordy and insolent braggart."</p> 
<p>"And how if I refuse to shoot on such a wager?" said the yeoman. ---"Your Grace's power, supported, as it is, by so many men-at-arms, may indeed easily strip and scourge me, but cannot compel me to bend or to draw my bow."</p> 
<p>"If thou refusest my fair proffer," said the Prince, "the Provost of the lists shall cut thy bowstring, break thy bow and arrows, and expel thee from the presence as a faint-hearted craven."</p> 
<p>"This is no fair chance you put on me, proud Prince," said the yeoman, "to compel me to peril myself against the best archers of Leicester And Staffordshire, under the penalty of infamy if they should overshoot me. Nevertheless, I will obey your pleasure."</p> 
<p>"Look to him close, men-at-arms," said Prince John, "his heart is sinking; I am jealous lest he attempt to escape the trial.---And do you, good fellows, shoot boldly round; a buck and a butt of wine are ready for your refreshment in yonder tent, when the prize is won."</p> 
<p>A target was placed at the upper end of the southern avenue which led to the lists. The contending archers took their station in turn, at the bottom of the southern access, the distance between that station and the mark allowing full distance for what was called a shot at rovers. The archers, having previously determined by lot their order of precedence, were to shoot each three shafts in succession. The sports were regulated by an officer of inferior rank, termed the Provost of the Games; for the high rank of the marshals of the lists would have been held degraded, had they condescended to superintend the sports of the yeomanry.</p> 
<p>One by one the archers, stepping forward, delivered their shafts yeomanlike and bravely. Of twenty-four arrows, shot in succession, ten were fixed in the target, and the others ranged so near it, that, considering the distance of the mark, it was accounted good archery. Of the ten shafts which hit the target, two within the inner ring were shot by Hubert, a forester in the service of Malvoisin, who was accordingly pronounced victorious.</p> 
<p>"Now, Locksley," said Prince John to the bold yeoman, with a bitter smile, "wilt thou try conclusions with Hubert, or wilt thou yield up bow, baldric, and quiver, to the Provost of the sports?"</p> 
<p>"Sith it be no better," said Locksley, "I am content to try my fortune; on condition that when I have shot two shafts at yonder mark of Hubert's, he shall be bound to shoot one at that which I shall propose."</p> 
<p>"That is but fair," answered Prince John, "and it shall not be refused thee.---If thou dost beat this braggart, Hubert, I will fill the bugle with silver-pennies for thee."</p> 
<p>"A man can do but his best," answered Hubert; "but my grandsire drew a good long bow at Hastings, and I trust not to dishonour his memory."</p> 
<p>The former target was now removed, and a fresh one of the same size placed in its room. Hubert, who, as victor in the first trial of skill, had the right to shoot first, took his aim with great deliberation, long measuring the distance with his eye, while he held in his hand his bended bow, with the arrow placed on the string. At length he made a step forward, and raising the bow at the full stretch of his left arm, till the centre or grasping-place was nigh level with his face, he drew his bowstring to his ear. The arrow whistled through the air, and lighted within the inner ring of the target, but not exactly in the centre.</p> 
<p>"You have not allowed for the wind, Hubert," said his antagonist, bending his bow, "or that had been a better shot."</p> 
<p>So saying, and without showing the least anxiety to pause upon his aim, Locksley stept to the appointed station, and shot his arrow as carelessly in appearance as if he had not even looked at the mark. He was speaking almost at the instant that the shaft left the bowstring, yet it alighted in the target two inches nearer to the white spot which marked the centre than that of Hubert.</p> 
<p>"By the light of heaven!" said Prince John to Hubert, "an thou suffer that runagate knave to overcome thee, thou art worthy of the gallows!"</p> 
<p>Hubert had but one set speech for all occasions. "An your highness were to hang me," he said, "a man can but do his best. Nevertheless, my grandsire drew a good bow---"</p> 
<p>"The foul fiend on thy grandsire and all his generation!" interrupted John , "shoot, knave, and shoot thy best, or it shall be the worse for thee!"</p> 
<p>Thus exhorted, Hubert resumed his place, and not neglecting the caution which he had received from his adversary, he made the necessary allowance for a very light air of wind, which had just arisen, and shot so successfully that his arrow alighted in the very centre of the target.</p> 
<p>"A Hubert! a Hubert!" shouted the populace, more interested in a known person than in a stranger. "In the clout!---in the clout! ---a Hubert for ever!"</p> 
<p>"Thou canst not mend that shot, Locksley," said the Prince, with an insulting smile.</p> 
<p>"I will notch his shaft for him, however," replied Locksley.</p> 
<p>And letting fly his arrow with a little more precaution than before, it lighted right upon that of his competitor, which it split to shivers. The people who stood around were so astonished at his wonderful dexterity, that they could not even give vent to their surprise in their usual clamour. "This must be the devil, and no man of flesh and blood," whispered the yeomen to each other; "such archery was never seen since a bow was first bent in Britain."</p> 
<p>"And now," said Locksley, "I will crave your Grace's permission to plant such a mark as is used in the North Country; and welcome every brave yeoman who shall try a shot at it to win a smile from the bonny lass he loves best."</p> 
<p>He then turned to leave the lists. "Let your guards attend me," he said, "if you please---I go but to cut a rod from the next willow-bush."</p> 
<p>Prince John made a signal that some attendants should follow him in case of his escape: but the cry of "Shame! shame!" which burst from the multitude, induced him to alter his ungenerous purpose.</p> 
<p>Locksley returned almost instantly with a willow wand about six feet in length, perfectly straight, and rather thicker than a man's thumb. He began to peel this with great composure, observing at the same time, that to ask a good woodsman to shoot at a target so broad as had hitherto been used, was to put shame upon his skill. "For his own part," he said, "and in the land where he was bred, men would as soon take for their mark King Arthur's round-table, which held sixty knights around it. A child of seven years old," he said, "might hit yonder target with a headless shaft; but," added he, walking deliberately to the other end of the lists, and sticking the willow wand upright in the ground, "he that hits that rod at five-score yards, I call him an archer fit to bear both bow and quiver before a king, an it were the stout King Richard himself."</p> 
<p>"My grandsire," said Hubert, "drew a good bow at the battle of Hastings, and never shot at such a mark in his life---and neither will I. If this yeoman can cleave that rod, I give him the bucklers---or rather, I yield to the devil that is in his jerkin, and not to any human skill; a man can but do his best, and I will not shoot where I am sure to miss. I might as well shoot at the edge of our parson's whittle, or at a wheat straw, or at a sunbeam, as at a twinkling white streak which I can hardly see."</p> 
<p>"Cowardly dog!" said Prince John.---"Sirrah Locksley, do thou shoot; but, if thou hittest such a mark, I will say thou art the first man ever did so. However it be, thou shalt not crow over us with a mere show of superior skill."</p> 
<p>"I will do my best, as Hubert says," answered Locksley; "no man can do more."</p> 
<p>So saying, he again bent his bow, but on the present occasion looked with attention to his weapon, and changed the string, which he thought was no longer truly round, having been a little frayed by the two former shots. He then took his aim with some deliberation, and the multitude awaited the event in breathless silence. The archer vindicated their opinion of his skill: his arrow split the willow rod against which it was aimed. A jubilee of acclamations followed; and even Prince John, in admiration of Locksley's skill, lost for an instant his dislike to his person. "These twenty nobles," he said, "which, with the bugle, thou hast fairly won, are thine own; we will make them fifty, if thou wilt take livery and service with us as a yeoman of our body guard, and be near to our person. For never did so strong a hand bend a bow, or so true an eye direct a shaft."</p> 
<p>"Pardon me, noble Prince," said Locksley; "but I have vowed, that if ever I take service, it should be with your royal brother King Richard. These twenty nobles I leave to Hubert, who has this day drawn as brave a bow as his grandsire did at Hastings. Had his modesty not refused the trial, he would have hit the wand as well I."</p> 
<p>Hubert shook his head as he received with reluctance the bounty of the stranger, and Locksley, anxious to escape further observation, mixed with the crowd, and was seen no more.</p> 
<p>The victorious archer would not perhaps have escaped John's attention so easily, had not that Prince had other subjects of anxious and more important meditation pressing upon his mind at that instant. He called upon his chamberlain as he gave the signal for retiring from the lists, and commanded him instantly to gallop to Ashby, and seek out Isaac the Jew. "Tell the dog," he said, "to send me, before sun-down, two thousand crowns. He knows the security; but thou mayst show him this ring for a token. The rest of the money must be paid at York within six days. If he neglects, I will have the unbelieving villain's head. Look that thou pass him not on the way; for the circumcised slave was displaying his stolen finery amongst us."</p> 
<p>So saying, the Prince resumed his horse, and returned to Ashby, the whole crowd breaking up and dispersing upon his retreat.</p>

<p>艾文荷的名字一经讲出，立即从一张嘴飞向另一张嘴，速度之快说明了人们的关心和好奇心如何之大。不用多久，它就传到了亲王的圈子中，他听到这消息，脸色顿时变得阴沉了。然而他向周围扫了一眼，装出鄙夷的神气，说道：“各位爷们，尤其是你，艾默长老，博学之士说，人的内心天然会对事物产生好感和恶感，你们觉得这个理论怎么样？在我还根本没有猜到裹在那套盔甲中的人是谁时，我便意识到，我兄长的宠臣已来到我们面前。”</p> 
<p>“牛面将军必须准备归还他得到的艾文荷封地了，”德布拉酉说，他刚完成了比武的光荣任务，丢下盾牌和帽盔，重又回到亲王的随员中间。</p> 
<p>“对，”沃尔德马·菲泽西答道，“这小伙子看来是会要求把理查赐给他的城堡和采邑还给他的，尽管殿下已慷慨地把它们赏给了牛面将军。”</p> 
<p>“艾文荷这样的领地，”约翰答道，“哪怕有三个，牛面将军也不会嫌多，他是不会把到手的东西再吐出来的。再说，诸位，我希望你们没有人会否认，我有权把王室的领地分封给忠实追随我，随时准备完成作战任务的人，让他们取代那些在国外游荡，到了需要的时候，却既不能出力也无法效忠的人。”</p> 
<p>这个问题对那些人关系太大了，他们不可能不认为，亲王自封的权力是完全不容否认的。一致恭维他是“一个慷慨的亲王！一个对忠实的追随者赏罚分明的、高贵正直的王爷！”</p> 
<p>随员中的这一片颂扬声，自然都来自怀有非分之想的人，他们即使还没有真正从损害理查工的亲信和随从的利益中得到好处，也指望有朝一日能得到这样的好处。艾默院长也赞同大家的看法，只是指出：“不能把神圣的耶路撒冷真的称作外国，它是共同的母亲——一切基督徒的圣地。”但是他宣称，他认为“艾文荷骑士不能以此为口实，替自己辩解”，因为他相信，“理查统率的十字军至多只到达了阿什克伦(注)，全世界都知道，那本来是非利士人的城市，没有任何权利享受圣城的名义。”沃尔德马出于好奇心，曾到艾文荷倒下的地方查看过，现在他回来了，说道：“那小伙子看来不会给殿下增添什么麻烦，牛面将军大可放心，不必为他得到的封地发愁；那人的伤势非常重呢。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)阿什克伦在巴勒斯坦，加沙以北，非利士人的古城。</p> 
<p>“但不论他的伤势怎样，”约翰亲王说，“他是今天的优胜者；哪怕他是我们十倍的敌人，或者我兄长的赤胆忠心的臣子，反正都一样他的伤势仍必须得到医疗，让我们的医生去照料他吧。”＿</p> 
<p>他讲话时，嘴角露出了一抹阴险的微笑。沃尔德马赶紧答道。艾文荷早已给扶出比武场，处在他的亲友的照料下了。</p> 
<p>“我看到爱和美的女王那么悲痛，确实有些难过，”他说道，“想不到女王的大喜日子给这件事搞成了悲剧。我这个人看到女人为她的情人伤心，是从来不会感动的，但是这个罗文娜小姐不同，她忍住了悲伤，态度仍那么庄严，要不是她握紧双手，没有眼泪的眼睛微微颤动，盯住了面前那个气息奄奄的身子，谁也不会发现她的痛苦。”</p> 
<p>“这个罗文娜小姐大家谈得这么多，”约翰亲王说道，“她究竟是谁啊？”</p> 
<p>“一个撒克逊女继承人，拥有大量家产，”艾默长老回答，“一朵可爱的玫瑰花，一颗价值连城的珍珠，千里挑一的美人，一束芳草，一株龙脑香。”</p> 
<p>“我们要使她破涕为笑，转悲为喜，”约翰亲王说，“把她嫁给一个诺曼人，改变她的血统。她好像还没成年，我们王室有权支配她的婚姻。德布拉西，你说这话对吗？如果让你效法征服者的部下，娶一个撒克逊女子，获得大片富饶的田地和大量财产，你觉得怎么样？”</p> 
<p>“只要这些田地合我的心意，殿下，”德布拉西答道，“那么加上一个新娘，我是不会不愿意的；这件好事会使我终生忠于殿下，您对您的仆人和藩臣所作的一切许诺，也就真的兑现了。”</p> 
<p>“我不会忘记这事，”约翰亲王说，“我们可以马上着手办理，命令我的总管立即通知罗文娜小姐和她的伴当——我是指那个乡巴佬，她的监护人，还有那个在比武大会上给黑甲骑士打翻在地的撒克逊公牛——出席今晚的宴会。德比戈特，”他转身对他的管家说，“这第二次邀请，你可得尽量客气一些，满足那些撒克逊人的自尊心，使他们无法再度拒绝，虽然我可以凭圣贝克特的遗骨起誓，跟这些家伙讲礼貌只是对牛弹琴。”</p> 
<p>约翰亲王边说边走，打算示意大家离开比武场了，但正在这时，一封小小的信递到了他手中。</p> 
<p>“从哪儿来的？”约翰亲王问，看了看递信的人。</p> 
<p>“从国外来的，殿下，但这是谁发出的，我不知道，”侍仆回答。“这是一个法国人带到这儿的，他说他一路上马不停蹄，日夜兼程，务求把它及时送到殿下手中。”</p> 
<p>亲王仔细端详了一会信封上的字，又看看盖在扎信封的丝线上的火漆印，那上面有三个百合花纹(注)。约翰拆开信封时显得有些不安，随着读到的内容，这种不安越来越明显和强烈了。信上的话是这么几个字：</p> 
<p>“务必小心，魔鬼已逃出牢笼！”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)这是法国王室的纹章图案。</p> 
<p>亲王的脸色变得死一般苍白，他先看看地上，又望望天空，仿佛一个人接到了判处死刑的消息。从开头的惊慌中定下神来以后，他把沃尔德马·菲泽西和德布拉西叫到一边，将信相继拿给他们看，然后用颤抖的声音说道：“这是告诉我，我的哥哥理查已获得自由。”</p> 
<p>“这可能只是一场虚惊，信是伪造的，”德布拉西说。</p> 
<p>“这是法王的亲笔，盖着他的印，”约翰亲王答道。</p> 
<p>“那么，”菲泽西说，“事不宜迟，得立刻集合我们的人马了，在约克或其他中心地点都可以。再晚几天恐怕就真的来不及了。殿下得马上宣布中断这场游戏才是。”</p> 
<p>“农民和老百姓还没参加比赛，这么草草收场，他们一定会不满意，”德布拉西说。</p> 
<p>“今天时间还早，”沃尔德马说，“不妨立即举行射箭比赛，评出胜负，颁发奖品。这样，对那些撒克逊奴才说来，亲王的诺言已充分履行了。”</p> 
<p>“谢谢你，沃尔德马，”亲王说道，“你也提醒了我，那个傲慢的农民昨天侮辱过我，我还没跟他算账呢。我们的宴会也得在今天晚上按原计划举行。哪怕这是我最后一小时掌握权力，这一小时仍是神圣的，不论报复和取乐都应照常进行。新的麻烦等新的一天到来时再说吧。”</p> 
<p>号声立刻吹响了，把正要离开比武场的观众又叫了回来。典礼官宣布，约翰亲王因有重大而紧急的公事亟待处理，不得不取消明日继续举行的比赛；然而他不愿让这么多身怀绝技的平民就这么离开，得不到施展能耐的机会，因此决定在散场之前，立即进行预定在明天举行的射箭比赛。射箭的优胜者将获得奖赏，即一只镶银的号角和一条绣有狩猎保护神圣休伯特图像的贵重丝肩带。</p> 
<p>起先有三十多个庄稼人报名参加比赛，其中几个是尼德伍德森林和查恩伍德森林的护林人和他们的助手。然而当射手们发现要与这些人进行比赛时，有二十来人退出了竞赛，不愿在几乎必然失败的角逐中自讨没趣。因为在那些日子，每个著名弓箭手的技艺，在周围许多英里以内是无人不知的，正如在新市场(注)训练出来的每匹马的优点，凡是经常出入那个著名集市的人都了如指掌。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)英国以驯马和赛马闻名的集镇，买卖马匹的中心之一。</p> 
<p>争夺射手荣誉的名单虽然少了一些，仍有八人。约翰亲王从他的宝座走前几步，打量了一下那些入选的庄稼人，其中几人穿着王家猎园仆役的制服。这检查满足了他的好奇心之后，他开始用眼睛搜寻他憎恨的那个人了。他发现这人仍站在原地，脸上的神色也与昨天一样，仍显得那么泰然自若。</p> 
<p>“汉子，”约翰亲王说，“我听了你昨天傲慢无礼的大话，就知道你不是真正喜欢弯弓射箭的人现在果真如此，你看到这些快活的小伙子站在那里，便不敢冒险，与他们比试高低了。””</p> 
<p>“对不起，殿下，”自耕农回答，“我不参加射箭，除了怕失败，怕丢脸之外，还另有原因。”</p> 
<p>“你的另有原因是什么？”约翰亲王问，他出于某种也许连他自己也解释不清的理由，对这个人怀有一种欲罢不能的好奇心。</p> 
<p>“首先，”庄户人答道，“我不知道，这些弓箭手平时用的靶子，是不是与我的相同；其次，我不明白，殿下对一个出言不逊、得罪了您的人，为什么兴趣这么大，万一他得了个三等奖，这对您也不见得光彩。”</p> 
<p>约翰亲王的脸蓦地红了，他问道；“庄稼人，你叫什么名字？”</p> 
<p>“洛克斯利(注)，”庄稼人答道。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)这里写的自耕农就是罗宾汉，他作为英国民间传说中的英雄人物，无真实姓名可查，但据说他出生在一个名叫洛克斯利的村子里，因此有时人们便用它作他的名字。罗宾汉也以神箭手闻名。</p> 
<p>“那么，洛克斯利，”约翰亲王说，“你可以等这些人表演完以后，你再射箭。如果你得了奖，我可以另外再赏你二十枚金币；但是如果你输了，你就得剥下你那身草绿色衣服(注)，让人用弓弦把你打出比武场，作为对一个夸夸其谈、专讲大话的无礼汉子的惩戒。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)英国的护林人和猎人大多穿草绿色衣服，他们以善于射箭著称。</p> 
<p>“但是如果我不愿打赌，拒绝参加比赛呢？”自耕农说。“殿下有权有势，又有这么多卫士听您使唤，要剥掉我的衣服打我，确实很容易，但是您无法强迫我射箭。”</p> 
<p>“如果你不识抬举，拒绝我的建议，”亲王说，“比武场的值勤官就得割断你的弓弦，折断你的弓箭，把你当一个胆小鬼赶出场子。”</p> 
<p>“可这并不公正，骄傲的亲王，”自耕农说，“您强迫我冒风险，跟莱斯特郡和斯塔福郡最好的弓箭手较量，可是如果他们赢了，我还得受到不体面的惩罚，哪有这种事。不过既然您要这么办，我可以服从。”</p> 
<p>“卫士们，仔细看好他，”约翰亲王说，“他已经害怕了；我得留心，别让他溜走，逃避这场比赛。小伙子们，你们是好样的，拿出射箭的本领来吧；一只公羊和一大桶酒已在那边帐篷里准备犒赏你们了。”</p> 
<p>靶子设在比武场南面通道的上端。比赛的人便站在通道的出人口轮流射击，这里与目标的距离正好符合所谓远距离射箭的标准。弓箭手们先抽签决定前后次序，他们每人可以接连射三次。比赛由一位称作竞技监督官的较低级官员主持，因为警卫督察职位较高，他们不愿降低身分，主持平民百姓的比赛。</p> 
<p>弓箭手们一个接一个抖擞精神，雄赳赳地跨前几步，走到规定的位置上进行射击。二十四枝箭接连发出了，十枝射中了靶子，其余的也离它不远，从目标的距离看，仍可算作成绩良好。在十枝射中靶子的箭中，两校在内圈以内，是马尔沃辛家的护林人休伯特射的，因此他被宣布为优胜者。</p> 
<p>“洛克斯利，现在轮到你了，”约翰亲王对大胆的自耕农说，露出了讥笑，“你是愿意与休伯特一决胜负呢，还是愿意向竞技监督官交出你的弓箭和肩带？”</p> 
<p>“既然没有别的法子，”洛克斯利说，“那么我还是碰碰运气吧；不过我有个条件，我在休伯特的靶子上射过两箭以后，他也必须在我要他射的靶子上射一次。”</p> 
<p>“那完全公平合理，”约翰亲王答道，“我不反对你的要求。休伯特，只要你能打败这个牛皮大王，我可以把那个号角装满了银币送给你。”</p> 
<p>“一个人只能尽力而为，”休伯特答道，“不过我有一个祖宗在黑斯廷斯战役中挽得一手好弓，我相信我不会辱没他的名声。”</p> 
<p>原来的靶子取走了，换了一个新的，大小一样，放在原地。休伯特作为前一轮比赛的优胜者，有权先射；他把弓挽在手里，在弦上搭好箭，小心翼翼瞄准目标，又用眼睛量了好久距离。最后他跨前一步，伸直左臂，把弓举起一些，使它的中心或者握手处几乎与脸同一高度，然后把弓弦拉到耳朵那里。箭呼啸着穿过空中，落在靶子的内圈里边，但不是在正中央。</p> 
<p>“你没有考虑到风力，休怕特，”他的对手一边说，一边弯弓，“要不，成绩还会好些。”</p> 
<p>这么说时，洛克斯利已跨前几步，走到指定的地点，似乎根本没把他的目标当一回事，举起弓，好像连瞧也没瞧那个靶子，便漫不经心似的射出了箭。他的话几乎还没停，那枝箭已离开弓弦，飞到了靶子上，离正中心的白点比休伯特的箭更近两英寸。</p> 
<p>“老天爷作证！”约翰亲王对休伯特说，“要是你败在那个跑江湖的混蛋手中，你就应该在绞架上吊死！”</p> 
<p>休伯特回答的反正还是那套话：“殿下可以绞死我，”他说，“一个人只能尽力而为。不过我的一个祖宗挽得一手好弓……”</p> 
<p>“见你的鬼，我不管你的祖宗怎么样！”约翰打断了他的话。“射箭，混蛋，射出成绩来，要不然我烧不了你！”</p> 
<p>经过这么开导之后，休伯特回到了射箭的地方，这次没有忽略他的对手向他提出的劝告，对正好吹过的一阵微风给予了必要的考虑；这次他射得很成功，箭头落在靶子的正中央。</p> 
<p>“好箭，好箭！不愧是休伯特(注)！”场内一片喝彩声，似乎是在为那个大名鼎鼎的圣徒，而不是在为一个陌生人欢呼。“射中靶心了，射中靶心了！休伯特永远是休伯特！”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)指狩猎守护神圣休伯特，这只是利用这人与圣休怕特同一名字玩弄的文字游戏。</p> 
<p>“这一次你可输定了，洛克斯利，”亲王说，露出了嘲笑。</p> 
<p>“那么我只得赶走他这枝箭了，”洛克斯利答道。</p> 
<p>现在他比上一次小心了一些，一箭射去正好击中那位对手的箭，把它打成了碎片。这精采的一箭把站在周围的人惊得愣住了，甚至忘记了用叫喊来表示他们的钦佩。“这一定是一个魔鬼，不是有血肉的凡人，”弓箭手们在窃窃低语。“这样好的箭术，从英国有弓箭以来还从没见到过。”</p> 
<p>“现在，”洛克斯利说，“我得要求殿下允许我另立一个靶子了，那是北方人常用的；我欢迎每一个勇敢的射手都来试试，借此博得他心爱的漂亮姑娘的一笑。”</p> 
<p>于是他转身向场外走去，一边说道：“您不放心，可以派人跟着我；我只是要上附近的柳树林砍一枝柳条。”</p> 
<p>约翰亲王做个手势，正打算让几个卫士跟着他，免得他逃走；但是人群中爆发了一片“可耻！可耻！”的喊声，这使他不得不打消了这个不够大方的主意。</p> 
<p>洛克斯利几乎马上带着一根柳树干回来了，它大约六英尺长，全部笔直的，比一个人的拇指略粗一些。他开始从容不迫地剥树皮，同时说道，要一个好猎户射刚才那么大的靶子，这简直是对他的箭来的侮辱。他说，照他看，在他生长的那片土地上，“这好比是拿亚瑟王的圆桌面作靶子(注)，那张桌子容得六十名骑士围桌而坐呢。一个七岁的小孩都可以闭着眼睛，射中那样的靶子。”然后他不慌不忙地走到场子的另一头，把柳干直直的插在地上，说道：“只有能在一百码以外射中这根干子的，才称得上是神箭手，才配在国王面前佩带弓箭，也就是给强大的理查国王当差。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>(注)亚瑟王是英国民间传说中的不列颠国王，他的故事构成了一套所谓亚瑟王传奇。他手下有不少骑士，据说为了免得这些人在就餐时互争座次，他命人制作了一张特大的圆桌，可以容纳几十人，甚至一百多人同时入席。</p> 
<p>“我的老祖宗挽得一手好弓，”休伯特说，“参加过黑斯廷斯战役，可他一辈子也没射过这样的靶子——我自然也没有。如果这个庄稼汉能一箭劈开这根树干，我只得甘拜下风，不过我想，我这是输给一个乔装改扮的魔鬼，不是输给一个凡人的。一个人只能尽力而为，我不会明知射不中还偏要射。这简直是要我射我们神父那把裁纸刀的刀口，或者一根麦秆，或者一条太阳光，那种照得我眼睛发花的白光。”</p> 
<p>“你这只胆小的狗！”约翰亲王说道。“洛克斯利老弟，你就射吧。如果你射中了，我得说，你是古往今来最好的弓箭手。不论怎样，你不要老是哇哇乱叫，吹个没完，得拿真本领给我们看。”</p> 
<p>“正如休伯特说的，我也只能尽力而为，”洛克斯利答道，“没有人能做得更好。”</p> 
<p>他一边这么说，一边又拉了拉弓，但这次他仔细检查了一下武器，换了一根弦，因为他发觉原来那根已不太光滑，经过前两次射击有些磨损了。然后他对着目标端详了一会，这时场内鸦雀无声，大家都屏声静气等待着结果。弓箭手证实了自己的技术，没有辜负人们的期望，他一箭射去，柳树于便应声劈开了。欢呼声随即惊天动地，约翰亲王也不得不对洛克斯利的本领大加赞赏，以致暂时忘记了对他本人的不满。“这二十个金币，”他说，“还有这号角，是你光明正大赢得的，现在都归你了。如果你肯穿上制服，在我的贴身卫队中当一名卫士，跟在我身边，我还可以给你五十枚金币。因为从没有人能这么坚定沉着地挽过弓，或者用这么分毫不差的目力射过箭。”</p> 
<p>“请原谅，高贵的亲王，”洛克斯利说，“但我已经起过誓，如果我参加军队，只能在您的王兄理查国王手下当差。这二十枚金币我让给休伯特，他今天干得很出色，跟他的祖先在黑斯廷斯一样。要是他不那么谦虚，不拒绝比赛，他也可以像我一样射中那根柳条。”</p> 
<p>休伯特一边摇头，一边半推半就地接受了陌生人的馈赠；洛克斯利不想让人继续看到他，伺机混进人群中，随即消失了。</p> 
<p>获胜的弓箭手能够这么容易地躲过约翰亲王的目光，也许是由于后者公务缠身，正忙于考虑另一些更紧急、更重要的事。他站起身来离开比武场时，招呼他的总管走到身边，命令他立即赶往阿什口，寻找犹太人以撒。“告诉这畜生，”他说，“在日落以前给我送两千克朗来。他知道担保是什么；但你可以拿这戒指给他看，让他放心。其余的款子，必须六天以内在约克城交付。如果他不好好办，告诉这个不信基督的混蛋，当心他的脑袋。你一路上得多加注意，别跟他走岔了，因为这个行过割礼的奴才，刚才还在这儿炫耀他骗来的漂亮衣服呢。”</p> 
<p>亲王说完便跨上了马背，返回阿什口；全场观众也随即散开，各自回家了。”</p>
