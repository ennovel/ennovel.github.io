They were not definite, but they were hopeful. It was generally understood that he could call on powerful influences in case of emergency, and that he had done so with success; and that evening, when Mrs. Beaufort appeared at the Opera wearing her old smile and a new emerald necklace, society drew a breath of relief.</p> 
<p>New York was inexorable in its condemnation of business irregularities. So far there had been no exception to its tacit rule that those who broke the law of probity must pay; and every one was aware that even Beaufort and Beaufort's wife would be offered up unflinchingly to this principle. But to be obliged to offer them up would be not only painful but inconvenient. The disappearance of the Beauforts would leave a considerable void in their compact little circle; and those who were too ignorant or too careless to shudder at the moral catastrophe bewailed in advance the loss of the best ball-room in New York.</p> 
<p>Archer had definitely made up his mind to go to Washington. He was waiting only for the opening of the law-suit of which he had spoken to May, so that its date might coincide with that of his visit; but on the following Tuesday he learned from Mr. Letterblair that the case might be postponed for several weeks. Nevertheless, he went home that afternoon determined in any event to leave the next evening. The chances were that May, who knew nothing of his professional life, and had never shown any interest in it, would not learn of the postponement, should it take place, nor remember the names of the litigants if they were mentioned before her; and at any rate he could no longer put off seeing Madame Olenska. There were too many things that he must say to her.</p> 
<p>On the Wednesday morning, when he reached his office, Mr. Letterblair met him with a troubled face. Beaufort, after all, had not managed to "tide over"; but by setting afloat the rumour that he had done so he had reassured his depositors, and heavy payments had poured into the bank till the previous evening, when disturbing reports again began to predominate. In consequence, a run on the bank had begun, and its doors were likely to close before the day was over. The ugliest things were being said of Beaufort's dastardly manoeuvre, and his failure promised to be one of the most discreditable in the history of Wall Street.</p> 
<p>The extent of the calamity left Mr. Letterblair white and incapacitated. "I've seen bad things in my time; but nothing as bad as this. Everybody we know will be hit, one way or another. And what will be done about Mrs. Beaufort? What CAN be done about her? I pity Mrs. Manson Mingott as much as anybody: coming at her age, there's no knowing what effect this affair may have on her. She always believed in Beaufort--she made a friend of him! And there's the whole Dallas connection: poor Mrs. Beaufort is related to every one of you. Her only chance would be to leave her husband--yet how can any one tell her so? Her duty is at his side; and luckily she seems always to have been blind to his private weaknesses."</p> 
<p>There was a knock, and Mr. Letterblair turned his head sharply. "What is it? I can't be disturbed."</p> 
<p>A clerk brought in a letter for Archer and withdrew. Recognising his wife's hand, the young man opened the envelope and read: "Won't you please come up town as early as you can? Granny had a slight stroke last night. In some mysterious way she found out before any one else this awful news about the bank. Uncle Lovell is away shooting, and the idea of the disgrace has made poor Papa so nervous that he has a temperature and can't leave his room. Mamma needs you dreadfully, and I do hope you can get away at once and go straight to Granny's."</p> 
<p>Archer handed the note to his senior partner, and a few minutes later was crawling northward in a crowded horse-car, which he exchanged at Fourteenth Street for one of the high staggering omnibuses of the Fifth Avenue line. It was after twelve o'clock when this laborious vehicle dropped him at old Catherine's. The sitting-room window on the ground floor, where she usually throned, was tenanted by the inadequate figure of her daughter, Mrs. Welland, who signed a haggard welcome as she caught sight of Archer; and at the door he was met by May. The hall wore the unnatural appearance peculiar to well-kept houses suddenly invaded by illness: wraps and furs lay in heaps on the chairs, a doctor's bag and overcoat were on the table, and beside them letters and cards had already piled up unheeded.</p> 
<p>May looked pale but smiling: Dr. Bencomb, who had just come for the second time, took a more hopeful view, and Mrs. Mingott's dauntless determination to live and get well was already having an effect on her family. May led Archer into the old lady's sitting-room, where the sliding doors opening into the bedroom had been drawn shut, and the heavy yellow damask portieres dropped over them; and here Mrs. Welland communicated to him in horrified undertones the details of the catastrophe. It appeared that the evening before something dreadful and mysterious had happened. At about eight o'clock, just after Mrs. Mingott had finished the game of solitaire that she always played after dinner, the door-bell had rung, and a lady so thickly veiled that the servants did not immediately recognise her had asked to be received.</p> 
<p>The butler, hearing a familiar voice, had thrown open the sitting-room door, announcing: "Mrs. Julius Beaufort"--and had then closed it again on the two ladies. They must have been together, he thought, about an hour. When Mrs. Mingott's bell rang Mrs. Beaufort had already slipped away unseen, and the old lady, white and vast and terrible, sat alone in her great chair, and signed to the butler to help her into her room. She seemed, at that time, though obviously distressed, in complete control of her body and brain. The mulatto maid put her to bed, brought her a cup of tea as usual, laid everything straight in the room, and went away; but at three in the morning the bell rang again, and the two servants, hastening in at this unwonted summons (for old Catherine usually slept like a baby), had found their mistress sitting up against her pillows with a crooked smile on her face and one little hand hanging limp from its huge arm.</p> 
<p>The stroke had clearly been a slight one, for she was able to articulate and to make her wishes known; and soon after the doctor's first visit she had begun to regain control of her facial muscles. But the alarm had been great; and proportionately great was the indignation when it was gathered from Mrs. Mingott's fragmentary phrases that Regina Beaufort had come to ask her--incredible effrontery!--to back up her husband, see them through--not to "desert" them, as she called it--in fact to induce the whole family to cover and condone their monstrous dishonour.</p> 
<p>"I said to her: "Honour's always been honour, and honesty honesty, in Manson Mingott's house, and will be till I'm carried out of it feet first,'" the old woman had stammered into her daughter's ear, in the thick voice of the partly paralysed. "And when she said: `But my name, Auntie--my name's Regina Dallas,' I said: `It was Beaufort when he covered you with jewels, and it's got to stay Beaufort now that he's covered you with shame.'"</p> 
<p>So much, with tears and gasps of horror, Mrs. Welland imparted, blanched and demolished by the unwonted obligation of having at last to fix her eyes on the unpleasant and the discreditable. "If only I could keep it from your father-in-law: he always says: `Augusta, for pity's sake, don't destroy my last illusions' --and how am I to prevent his knowing these horrors?" the poor lady wailed.</p> 
<p>"After all, Mamma, he won't have SEEN them," her daughter suggested; and Mrs. Welland sighed: "Ah, no; thank heaven he's safe in bed. And Dr. Bencomb has promised to keep him there till poor Mamma is better, and Regina has been got away somewhere."</p> 
<p>Archer had seated himself near the window and was gazing out blankly at the deserted thoroughfare. It was evident that he had been summoned rather for the moral support of the stricken ladies than because of any specific aid that he could render. Mr. Lovell Mingott had been telegraphed for, and messages were being despatched by hand to the members of the family living in New York; and meanwhile there was nothing to do but to discuss in hushed tones the consequences of Beaufort's dishonour and of his wife's unjustifiable action.</p> 
<p>Mrs. Lovell Mingott, who had been in another room writing notes, presently reappeared, and added her voice to the discussion. In THEIR day, the elder ladies agreed, the wife of a man who had done anything disgraceful in business had only one idea: to efface herself, to disappear with him. "There was the case of poor Grandmamma Spicer; your great-grandmother, May. Of course," Mrs. Welland hastened to add, "your great- grandfather's money difficulties were private--losses at cards, or signing a note for somebody--I never quite knew, because Mamma would never speak of it. But she was brought up in the country because her mother had to leave New York after the disgrace, whatever it was: they lived up the Hudson alone, winter and summer, till Mamma was sixteen. It would never have occurred to Grandmamma Spicer to ask the family to `countenance' her, as I understand Regina calls it; though a private disgrace is nothing compared to the scandal of ruining hundreds of innocent people."</p> 
<p>"Yes, it would be more becoming in Regina to hide her own countenance than to talk about other people's," Mrs. Lovell Mingott agreed. "I understand that the emerald necklace she wore at the Opera last Friday had been sent on approval from Ball and Black's in the afternoon. I wonder if they'll ever get it back?"</p> 
<p>Archer listened unmoved to the relentless chorus. The idea of absolute financial probity as the first law of a gentleman's code was too deeply ingrained in him for sentimental considerations to weaken it. An adventurer like Lemuel Struthers might build up the millions of his Shoe Polish on any number of shady dealings; but unblemished honesty was the noblesse oblige of old financial New York. Nor did Mrs. Beaufort's fate greatly move Archer. He felt, no doubt, more sorry for her than her indignant relatives; but it seemed to him that the tie between husband and wife, even if breakable in prosperity, should be indissoluble in misfortune. As Mr. Letterblair had said, a wife's place was at her husband's side when he was in trouble; but society's place was not at his side, and Mrs. Beaufort's cool assumption that it was seemed almost to make her his accomplice. The mere idea of a woman's appealing to her family to screen her husband's business dishonour was inadmissible, since it was the one thing that the Family, as an institution, could not do.</p> 
<p>The mulatto maid called Mrs. Lovell Mingott into the hall, and the latter came back in a moment with a frowning brow.</p> 
<p>"She wants me to telegraph for Ellen Olenska. I had written to Ellen, of course, and to Medora; but now it seems that's not enough. I'm to telegraph to her immediately, and to tell her that she's to come alone."</p> 
<p>The announcement was received in silence. Mrs. Welland sighed resignedly, and May rose from her seat and went to gather up some newspapers that had been scattered on the floor.</p> 
<p>"I suppose it must be done," Mrs. Lovell Mingott continued, as if hoping to be contradicted; and May turned back toward the middle of the room.</p> 
<p>"Of course it must be done," she said. "Granny knows what she wants, and we must carry out all her wishes. Shall I write the telegram for you, Auntie? If it goes at once Ellen can probably catch tomorrow morning's train." She pronounced the syllables of the name with a peculiar clearness, as if she had tapped on two silver bells.</p> 
<p>"Well, it can't go at once. Jasper and the pantry-boy are both out with notes and telegrams."</p> 
<p>May turned to her husband with a smile. "But here's Newland, ready to do anything. Will you take the telegram, Newland? There'll be just time before luncheon."</p> 
<p>Archer rose with a murmur of readiness, and she seated herself at old Catherine's rosewood "Bonheur du Jour," and wrote out the message in her large immature hand. When it was written she blotted it neatly and handed it to Archer.</p> 
<p>"What a pity," she said, "that you and Ellen will cross each other on the way!--Newland," she added, turning to her mother and aunt, "is obliged to go to Washington about a patent law-suit that is coming up before the Supreme Court. I suppose Uncle Lovell will be back by tomorrow night, and with Granny improving so much it doesn't seem right to ask Newland to give up an important engagement for the firm--does it?"</p> 
<p>She paused, as if for an answer, and Mrs. Welland hastily declared: "Oh, of course not, darling. Your Granny would be the last person to wish it." As Archer left the room with the telegram, he heard his mother-in- law add, presumably to Mrs. Lovell Mingott: "But why on earth she should make you telegraph for Ellen Olenska--" and May's clear voice rejoin: "Perhaps it's to urge on her again that after all her duty is with her husband."</p> 
<p>The outer door closed on Archer and he walked hastily away toward the telegraph office.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>第二天，有关博福特的处境，华尔街有了更多安慰性的报道。这些报道虽不十分明确，却很有希望。人们听说，遇到紧急情况他可以请求有权势的大人物帮忙，而他在这方面已经取得成功。这天晚上，当博福特太太戴着一串祖母绿的新项链，面带熟悉的笑容出现在歌剧场上时，社交界宽慰地舒了一口气。</p> 
<p>纽约社会对生意场中不轨行为的谴责是毫不留情的。迄今为止，这项不言而喻的规矩尚无一个例外：破坏这项诚实法则的人都必须付出代价；人人都清楚，即使是博福特和博福特的妻子，也会被毫不犹豫地端出来，作为这项法则的祭品。然而不得已将他们端出来，不仅是件费力的事，且会带来诸多不便。博福特夫妇的消失将会在他们紧密的小圈子里造成相当大的空白；而那些过于无知、过于粗心、因而不会为道德灾难而惊恐的人们，已经为要失去纽约最好的舞厅而提前发出悲哀的叹息了。</p> 
<p>阿切尔已打定主意要去华盛顿。他只盼着他对梅讲的那件诉讼开庭，以便其日期可能与他的拜访巧合。然而第二周的周二，他从莱特布赖先生那儿得知案子可能要推迟几个星期。尽管如此，这天下午他回家后依然决定，无论如何要在翌日傍晚动身。侥幸的是梅对他的职业生活一无所知，而已从来没表露过任何兴趣，她大概不会了解延期的事，即使知道了，在她面前提起当事人的名字，她也不会记得。而不管怎样，他不能再推迟去见奥兰斯卡夫人了，他有太多太多的事必须对她讲。</p> 
<p>星期三上午他到了办公室，看见莱特布赖先生满面愁容。博福特到底还是未能设法“过关”。但他通过散布自己已度过难关的谣言，让他的存款人安了心，截止前一天傍晚，大量的付款源源不断地注入银行，而这时，令人不安的报道才又开始占据上风。结果向银行的挤兑又开始了，不等今天结束，银行很可能就得关门。人们纷纷议论博福特丑恶的懦夫行径，他的失败可能成为华尔街历史上最可耻的事件。</p> 
<p>灾难的严重性使莱特布赖先生脸色煞白，一筹莫展。“我一生见过很多糟糕的事情，但没有一次比这一件更糟糕。我们认识的每一个人都会这样那样地受到打击。博福特太太该怎么办呢？她又能怎么办？我同样也很同情曼森·明戈特太太：到了她这样的年纪，不知道这事会对她产生什么影响、她一直信任博福特——还把他当成朋友呢！还有达拉斯家的全部亲戚，可怜的博福特太太与你们每个人都有亲戚关系。她惟一的机会是离开她丈夫——可怎么能对她讲呢？留在他身边是她的本分，幸运的是她似乎一直对他私下的癖好视而不见。”</p> 
<p>传来一声敲门声，莱特布赖猛地转过头去。“什么事？别来打扰我。”</p> 
<p>一位职员送来一封给阿切尔的信，接着便出去了。年轻人认出是他妻子的笔迹，便打开信封，读道：“请尽快进城来好吗？昨晚外婆有点犯病，她很神秘地最先发现了有关银行的可怕消息。洛弗尔舅舅外出打猎去了，可怜的爸爸十分害怕丢脸，竞发起烧来，不能出门。妈妈非常需要你来，我也希望你立刻动身，直接到外婆家去。”</p> 
<p>阿切尔将信递给他的上司，几分钟之后他便坐上拥挤的马拉街车，慢吞吞向北驶去。在14街他又换乘第五大街专线一辆摇摇晃晃的公共马车。过了12点，那笨重的交通工具才把他丢在老凯瑟琳家的门前。平时由她君临的一楼起居室窗口被她女儿韦兰太太不相称的身影占据了。后者看见阿切尔，憔悴的脸上露出欢迎的神色。梅在门口迎住他。门厅的外观有些异样，这是整洁住宅在突遭疾病袭击时的特有现象：椅子上一堆堆的披肩和皮衣，桌上摆着医生的提包和外套，旁边堆着无人留意的信件与名片。</p> 
<p>梅脸色苍白，但露着笑容告诉他：本科姆医生刚刚第二次光临，他的态度更加乐观了。明戈特太太活下去并恢复健康的坚强决心已经对家人产生影响。她领着阿切尔进了老夫人的起居室，里面那直通卧室的斜拉门已经关上，沉甸甸的黄缎门帘挂在上面。韦兰太太在这儿用惊恐的低音向他转述了灾难的详情。似乎是在前一大晚上，发生了一件神秘而又可怕的事。大约8点钟，明戈特太太刚结束她平时在饭后玩的单人纸牌游戏，这时门铃响了，一位戴着厚面纱的夫人求见，仆人当时没认出是谁。</p> 
<p>管家听声音很熟，便推开起居室的门通报道：“朱利叶斯·博福特太太到。”接着又为两位夫人关上了门，他觉得她们俩一起待了大约一个小时光景。当明戈特太太的铃声响起时，博福特太太已悄然离去。只见老夫人独自坐在她那把大椅子里，脸色煞白，十分吓人，她示意管家帮她进卧室。那时候，她看起来尽管明显十分苦恼，但身体与头脑仍能完全控制。那位混血女佣把她安置在床上，跟平时一样给她端来一杯茶，把屋子里一一收拾停当，便走了。但在凌晨3点钟，铃声又响了，两个仆人听到这不寻常的召唤急忙赶来（因为老凯瑟琳平时睡得像婴儿一般甜），发现他们的女主人抵着枕头坐着，脸上挂着一丝苦笑，一只小手从大胳臂上无力地垂下来。</p> 
<p>这次中风显然还属轻度，因为她吐字还算清晰，能表达自己的愿望；而且医生第一次诊治之后，很快便恢复了面部肌肉的控制。然而，这件事不仅引起全家人极大的惊恐，同时在了解真相后，他们也产生了极大的愤慨。大家从明戈特太太支离破碎的话语中得知，里吉纳·博福特是来要求她——真是厚颜无耻！——支持她丈夫，帮他们度过难关，照她的说法，别“抛弃”他们——实际上是功全家人掩盖并宽恕他们的丑恶行径。</p> 
<p>“我对她说了：‘名誉终归是名誉，诚实终归是诚实，在曼森·明戈特家，永远不会变，直到人家把我脚朝前从这儿抬出去，’”老太太用半瘫痪病人的沙哑声音结结巴巴对着女儿的耳朵说。“当她说‘可是姑妈，我的姓名——我的姓名是里吉纳·达拉斯’时，我说：‘博福特用珠宝把你包裹起来，你的姓就是博福特了，现在他又用耻辱包裹了你，你只好还叫博福特。’”</p> 
<p>韦兰太太流着眼泪，惊恐万状地喘息着转述了这些情况。由于承担了这不寻常的义务，最终不得不面对这些讨厌而又可耻的事实，她脸色惨白，摇摇欲坠。“我要是能瞒住你岳父该多好啊！他老是说：‘奥古斯塔，可怜可怜，别毁了我最后的幻想。’——可我怎么才能不让他知道这些可怕的事呢？”可怜的夫人哭泣着说。</p> 
<p>“妈妈，他毕竟见不到这些事了，”女儿提示说。韦兰太太则叹息道：“啊，是的；感谢上天，他躺在床上很安全。本科姆医生答应让他躺着，直到可怜的妈妈病情好转。而里吉纳也已经不知去向了。”</p> 
<p>阿切尔坐在窗口，茫然地凝望着空无人迹的大街。显然，他被召来更多地是为了给罹难的夫人们以精神的支持，而不是因为他能提供什么具体帮助。已经给洛弗尔· 明戈特先生发了电报，给住在纽约的家族成员的信息也在派人传送。这期间，除了悄声议论博福特的耻辱与他妻子的不正当行为造成的恶果别无他事。</p> 
<p>洛弗尔·明戈特太太刚才在另一间屋里写信，现在又过来加入了讨论。年长的夫人们一致认为，在她们那个时代，－。个在生意上丢了脸的男人，他妻子只能有一种想法：就是隐退，跟他一起销声匿迹。“可怜的祖母斯派塞——你的太外婆，梅——就是个例子。当然，”韦兰太太急忙补充说，“你太外公的财政困难是私人性质的——打牌输了，或者借给别人了——我一直不很清楚，因为妈妈从米不肯讲。但她是在乡下长大的，因为出了丢脸的事，不管是怎么回事，她母亲不得不离开了纽约。她们单独住在哈德逊河上游，年复一年，直到我妈妈16岁。斯派塞祖母是绝对不会像里吉纳那样要求家里人‘支持’她的，尽管私人性质的耻辱与毁了数百个无辜者的丑闻相比简直算不了什么。”</p> 
<p>“是啊，里吉纳若是躲起来不露面，比要求别人支持更得体，”洛弗尔太太赞同地说。“我听说，上星期五看歌剧时她戴的祖母绿项链是鲍尔一布莱克首饰店下午刚送去的试用品，不知他们是否还能收回去。”</p> 
<p>阿切尔无动于衷地听着异口同声的无情声讨。在财政事务中的绝对诚实，是绅士规范的首要法则，这在他心目中根深蒂固，多愁善感的体恤也不能将其削弱。像莱姆尔·斯特拉瑟斯之流的投机分子可以靠无数见不得人的勾当为他的鞋油店聚集几百万，但清白诚实依然是老纽约金融界崇尚的道德规范。博福特太太的命运也没有给阿切尔以太太的触动。与她那些愤愤的亲戚相比，他无疑更为她感到遗憾，但他认为夫妻间的纽带即便顺利时可以破裂，在逆境中却应坚不可摧。正如莱特布赖先生说的，当丈夫遇到困难时，妻子应该站在他一边。然而上流社会却不会站在他一边。博福特太太厚颜地臆断它会支持他，这种想法几乎把她变成了他的帮凶。她请求她的家人遮盖她丈夫生意上的耻辱——仅仅有这种想法都是不能允许的，因为家庭作为社会的细胞是不能做那种事的。</p> 
<p>混血女佣把洛弗尔太太叫到门厅，后者旋即皱着眉头回来了。</p> 
<p>“她要我发电报叫埃伦·奥兰斯卡。当然，我已经给埃伦写了信去，也给梅多拉写了。可现在看来还不行，我得赶紧去给她发份电报，叫她一个人回来。”</p> 
<p>迎接这一消息的是一片沉默。韦兰太太听大由命地叹了口气，梅则从座位上站起来，去收拾散落在地上的几张报纸。</p> 
<p>“我看这电报是一定得发了。”洛弗尔·明戈特太太接着说，似乎希望有人反对似的。梅转身走向屋子中间。</p> 
<p>“当然一定得发了，”她说。“外婆清楚自己想干什么，我们必须满足她的所有要求。我来为你写电文好吗，舅妈？如果立即发走，埃伦也许能赶上明晨的火车。”她将那名字的音节说得特别清晰，仿佛敲响两只银铃似的。</p> 
<p>“唔，马上可发不走，贾斯珀和配膳男仆都出去送信、发电报了。”</p> 
<p>梅嫣然一笑转向她的丈夫。“可这儿有纽兰待命呢。你去发电报好吗，纽兰？午饭前正好还来得及。”</p> 
<p>阿切尔站起来，咕哝说行。她自己坐到老凯瑟琳玫瑰木的“迭式写字台”旁，用她那尚不够圆熟的大字体写起了电文。写完又用吸墨纸仔细吸干，交给了阿切尔。</p> 
<p>“多可惜呀，”她说，“你和埃伦要在路上擦肩而过了！”她转过身来对着母亲和舅妈补充说：“纽兰得到华盛顿去，为了一件即将提交最高法院的专利案件。我想，洛弗尔舅舅明晚就回来了，既然外婆大有好转，似乎不应该让纽兰放弃事务所的一项重要任务吧？”</p> 
<p>她打住话头，仿佛等待回答。韦兰太太急忙声明说：“噢，当然不应该，亲爱的。你外婆最不愿那样了。”阿切尔拿着电报走出房间后，听到他的岳母又说——可能是对洛弗尔·明戈特：“可她究竟干吗要让你发电报叫埃伦·奥兰斯卡——”梅声音清晰地应声说：“也许是为了再次向她强调，她的职责终究是要和丈夫在一起。”</p> 
<p>外大门在阿切尔身后关上了，他急忙向电报局走去。</p>
