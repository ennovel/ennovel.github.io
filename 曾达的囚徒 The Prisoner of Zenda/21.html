<p>　　It was night, and I was in the cell wherein the King had lain in theCastle of Zenda. The great pipe that Rupert of Hentzau had nicknamed"Jacob's Ladder" was gone, and the lights in the room across the moattwinkled in the darkness. All was still; the din and clash of strife weregone. I had spent the day hidden in the forest, from the time when Fritzhad led me off, leaving Sapt with the princess. Under cover of dusk,muffled up, I had been brought to the Castle and lodged where I now lay.</p> 
<p>　　Though three men had died there--two of them by my hand-- I was nottroubled by ghosts. I had thrown myself on a pallet by the window, andwas looking out on the black water; Johann, the keeper, still pale from hiswound, but not much hurt besides, had brought me supper. He told me thatthe King was doing well, that he had seen the princess; that she and he,Sapt and Fritz, had been long together. Marshal Strakencz was gone toStrelsau; Black Michael lay in his coffin, and Antoinette de Maubanwatched by him; had I not heard, from the chapel, priests singing mass forhim?</p> 
<p>　　Outside there were strange rumours afloat. Some said that the prisonerof Zenda was dead; some, that he had vanished yet alive; some, that hewas a friend who had served the King well in some adventure in England;others, that he had discovered the Duke's plots, and had therefore beenkidnapped by him. One or two shrewd fellows shook their heads and saidonly that they would say nothing, but they had suspicions that more was tobe known than was known, if Colonel Sapt would tell all he knew.</p> 
<p>　　Thus Johann chattered till I sent him away and lay there alone,thinking, not of the future, but--as a man is wont to do when stirring thingshave happened to him--rehearsing the events of the past weeks, andwondering how strangely they had fallen out. And above me, in thestillness of the night, I heard the standards flapping against their poles, forBlack Michael's banner hung there half-mast high, and above it the royalflag of Ruritania, floating for one night more over my head. Habit grows so quick, that only by an effort did I recollect that it floated no longer forme.</p> 
<p>　　Presently Fritz von Tarlenheim came into the room. I was standingthen by the window; the glass was opened, and I was idly fingering thecement which clung to the masonry where "Jacob's Ladder" had been. Hetold me briefly that the King wanted me, and together we crossed thedrawbridge and entered the room that had been Black Michael's.</p> 
<p>　　The King was lying there in bed; our doctor from Tarlenheim was inattendance on him, and whispered to me that my visit must be brief. TheKing held out his hand and shook mine. Fritz and the doctor withdrew tothe window.</p> 
<p>　　I took the King's ring from my finger and placed it on his.</p> 
<p>　　"I have tried not to dishonour it, sire," said I.</p> 
<p>　　"I can't talk much to you," he said, in a weak voice. "I have had a greatfight with Sapt and the Marshal--for we have told the Marshal everything.</p> 
<p>　　I wanted to take you to Strelsau and keep you with me, and tell everyoneof what you had done; and you would have been my best and nearestfriend, Cousin Rudolf. But they tell me I must not, and that the secret mustbe kept-- if kept it can be.""They are right, sire. Let me go. My work here is done.""Yes, it is done, as no man but you could have done it. When they seeme again, I shall have my beard on; I shall--yes, faith, I shall be wastedwith sickness. They will not wonder that the King looks changed in face.</p> 
<p>　　Cousin, I shall try to let them find him changed in nothing else. You haveshown me how to play the King.""Sire," said I. "I can take no praise from you. It is by the narrowestgrace of God that I was not a worse traitor than your brother."He turned inquiring eyes on me; but a sick man shrinks from puzzles,and he had no strength to question me. His glance fell on Flavia's ring,which I wore. I thought he would question me about it; but, after fingeringit idly, he let his head fall on his pillow.</p> 
<p>　　"I don't know when I shall see you again," he said faintly, almostlistlessly.</p> 
<p>　　"If I can ever serve you again, sire," I answered.</p> 
<p>　　His eyelids closed. Fritz came with the doctor. I kissed the King's hand,and let Fritz lead me away. I have never seen the King since.</p> 
<p>　　Outside, Fritz turned, not to the right, back towards the drawbridge,but to the left, and without speaking led me upstairs, through a handsomecorridor in the chateau.</p> 
<p>　　"Where are we going?" I asked.</p> 
<p>　　Looking away from me, Fritz answered:</p> 
<p>　　"She has sent for you. When it is over, come back to the bridge. I'llwait for you there.""What does she want?" said I, breathing quickly.</p> 
<p>　　He shook his head.</p> 
<p>　　"Does she know everything?""Yes, everything."He opened a door, and gently pushing me in, closed it behind me. Ifound myself in a drawing-room, small and richly furnished. At first Ithought that I was alone, for the light that came from a pair of shadedcandles on the mantelpiece was very dim. But presently I discerned awoman's figure standing by the window. I knew it was the princess, and Iwalked up to her, fell on one knee, and carried the hand that hung by herside to my lips. She neither moved nor spoke. I rose to my feet, and,piercing the gloom with my eager eyes, saw her pale face and the gleam ofher hair, and before I knew, I spoke softly:</p> 
<p>　　"Flavia!"She trembled a little, and looked round. Then she darted to me, takinghold of me.</p> 
<p>　　"Don't stand, don't stand! No, you mustn't! You're hurt! Sit down--here,here!"She made me sit on a sofa, and put her hand on my forehead.</p> 
<p>　　"How hot your head is," she said, sinking on her knees by me. Thenshe laid her head against me, and I heard her murmur: "My darling, howhot your head is!"Somehow love gives even to a dull man the knowledge of his lover'sheart. I had come to humble myself and pray pardon for my presumption;but what I said now was:</p> 
<p>　　"I love you with all my heart and soul!"For what troubled and shamed her? Not her love for me, but the fearthat I had counterfeited the lover as I had acted the King, and taken herkisses with a smothered smile.</p> 
<p>　　"With all my life and heart," said I, as she clung to me. "Always, fromthe first moment I saw you in the Cathedral! There has been but onewoman in the world to me--and there will be no other. But God forgive methe wrong I've done you!""They made you do it!" she said quickly; and she added, raising herhead and looking in my eyes: "It might have made no difference if I'dknown it. It was always you, never the King!""I meant to tell you," said I. "I was going to on the night of the ball inStrelsau, when Sapt interrupted me. After that, I couldn't--I couldn't risklosing you before--before--I must! My darling, for you I nearly left theKing to die!""I know, I know! What are we to do now, Rudolf?"I put my arm round her and held her up while I said:</p> 
<p>　　"I am going away tonight.""Ah, no, no!" she cried. "Not tonight!""I must go tonight, before more people have seen me. And how wouldyou have me stay, sweetheart, except--?" "If I could come with you!" shewhispered very low.</p> 
<p>　　"My God!" said I roughly, "don't talk about that!" and I thrust her alittle back from me.</p> 
<p>　　"Why not? I love you. You are as good a gentleman as the King!"Then I was false to all that I should have held by. For I caught her inmy arms and prayed her, in words that I will not write, to come with me,daring all Ruritania to take her from me. And for a while she listened, withwondering, dazzled eyes. But as her eyes looked on me, I grew ashamed,and my voice died away in broken murmurs and stammerings, and at last Iwas silent.</p> 
<p>　　She drew herself away from me and stood against the wall, while I saton the edge of the sofa, trembling in every limb, knowing what I haddone--loathing it, obstinate not to undo it. So we rested a long time.</p> 
<p>　　"I am mad!" I said sullenly.</p> 
<p>　　"I love your madness, dear," she answered.</p> 
<p>　　Her face was away from me, but I caught the sparkle of a tear on hercheek. I clutched the sofa with my hand and held myself there.</p> 
<p>　　"Is love the only thing?" she asked, in low, sweet tones that seemed tobring a calm even to my wrung heart. "If love were the only thing, I wouldfollow you--in rags, if need be--to the world's end; for you hold my heartin the hollow of your hand! But is love the only thing?"I made no answer. It gives me shame now to think that I would nothelp her.</p> 
<p>　　She came near me and laid her hand on my shoulder. I put my hand upand held hers.</p> 
<p>　　"I know people write and talk as if it were. Perhaps, for some, Fate letsit be. Ah, if I were one of them! But if love had been the only thing, youwould have let the King die in his cell."I kissed her hand.</p> 
<p>　　"Honour binds a woman too, Rudolf. My honour lies in being true tomy country and my House. I don't know why God has let me love you; butI know that I must stay."Still I said nothing; and she, pausing a while, then went on:</p> 
<p>　　"Your ring will always be on my finger, your heart in my heart, thetouch of your lips on mine. But you must go and I must stay. Perhaps Imust do what it kills me to think of doing."I knew what she meant, and a shiver ran through me. But I could notutterly fail her. I rose and took her hand.</p> 
<p>　　"Do what you will, or what you must," I said. "I think God shows Hispurposes to such as you. My part is lighter; for your ring shall be on myfinger and your heart in mine, and no touch save of your lips will ever beon mine. So, may God comfort you, my darling!"There struck on our ears the sound of singing. The priests in the chapelwere singing masses for the souls of those who lay dead. They seemed tochant a requiem over our buried joy, to pray forgiveness for our love thatwould not die. The soft, sweet, pitiful music rose and fell as we stoodopposite one another, her hands in mine.</p> 
<p>　　"My queen and my beauty!" said I.</p> 
<p>　　"My lover and true knight!" she said. "Perhaps we shall never see oneanother again. Kiss me, my dear, and go!"I kissed her as she bade me; but at the last she clung to me, whisperingnothing but my name, and that over and over again --and again--and again;and then I left her.</p> 
<p>　　Rapidly I walked down to the bridge. Sapt and Fritz were waiting forme. Under their directions I changed my dress, and muffling my face, as Ihad done more than once before, I mounted with them at the door of theCastle, and we three rode through the night and on to the breaking day,and found ourselves at a little roadside station just over the border ofRuritania. The train was not quite due, and I walked with them in ameadow by a little brook while we waited for it. They promised to sendme all news; they overwhelmed me with kindness--even old Sapt wastouched to gentleness, while Fritz was half unmanned. I listened in a kindof dream to all they said. "Rudolf! Rudolf! Rudolf!" still rang in my ears-aburden of sorrow and of love. At last they saw that I could not heed them,and we walked up and down in silence, till Fritz touched me on the arm,and I saw, a mile or more away, the blue smoke of the train. Then I heldout a hand to each of them.</p> 
<p>　　"We are all but half-men this morning," said I, smiling. "But we havebeen men, eh, Sapt and Fritz, old friends? We have run a good coursebetween us.""We have defeated traitors and set the King firm on his throne," saidSapt.</p> 
<p>　　Then Fritz von Tarlenheim suddenly, before I could discern hispurpose or stay him, uncovered his head and bent as he used to do, andkissed my hand; and as I snatched it away, he said, trying to laugh:</p> 
<p>　　"Heaven doesn't always make the right men kings!"Old Sapt twisted his mouth as he wrung my hand.</p> 
<p>　　"The devil has his share in most things," said he.</p> 
<p>　　The people at the station looked curiously at the tall man with themuffled face, but we took no notice of their glances. I stood with my twofriends and waited till the train came up to us. Then we shook hands again, saying nothing; and both this time--and, indeed, from old Sapt it seemedstrange--bared their heads, and so stood still till the train bore me awayfrom their sight. So that it was thought some great man travelled privatelyfor his pleasure from the little station that morning; whereas, in truth itwas only I, Rudolf Rassendyll, an English gentleman, a cadet of a goodhouse, but a man of no wealth nor position, nor of much rank. They wouldhave been disappointed to know that. Yet had they known all they wouldhave looked more curiously still. For, be I what I might now, I had beenfor three months a King, which, if not a thing to be proud of, is at least anexperience to have undergone. Doubtless I should have thought more of it,had there not echoed through the air, from the towers of Zenda that wewere leaving far away, into my ears and into my heart the cry of awoman's love--"Rudolf! Rudolf! Rudolf!"Hark! I hear it now!</p>
