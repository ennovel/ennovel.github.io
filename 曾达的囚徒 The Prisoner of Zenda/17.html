I had prayed for dirty weather, such ashad favoured my previous voyage in the moat, but Fortune was this timeagainst me. Still I reckoned that by keeping close under the wall and in theshadow I could escape detection from the windows of the chateau thatlooked out on the scene of my efforts. If they searched the moat, indeed,my scheme must fail; but I did not think they would. They had made"Jacob's Ladder" secure against attack. Johann had himself helped to fix itclosely to the masonry on the under side, so that it could not now bemoved from below any more than from above. An assault with explosivesor a long battering with picks alone could displace it, and the noiseinvolved in either of these operations put them out of the question. Whatharm, then, could a man do in the moat? I trusted that Black Michael,putting this query to himself, would answer confidently, "None;" while,even if Johann meant treachery, he did not know my scheme, and woulddoubtless expect to see me, at the head of my friends, before the frontentrance to the chateau. There, I said to Sapt, was the real danger. "Andthere," I added, "you shall be. Doesn't that content you?"But it did not. Dearly would he have liked to come with me, had I notutterly refused to take him. One man might escape notice, to double theparty more than doubled the risk; and when he ventured to hint once againthat my life was too valuable, I, knowing the secret thought he clung to,sternly bade him be silent, assuring him that unless the King lived throughthe night, I would not live through it either.</p> 
<p>　　At twelve o'clock, Sapt's command left the chateau of Tarlenheim andstruck off to the right, riding by unfrequented roads, and avoiding the townof Zenda. If all went well, they would be in front of the Castle by about aquarter to two. Leaving their horses half a mile off, they were to steal upto the entrance and hold themselves in readiness for the opening of thedoor. If the door were not opened by two, they were to send Fritz vonTarlenheim round to the other side of the Castle. I would meet him there if I were alive, and we would consult whether to storm the Castle or not. If Iwere not there, they were to return with all speed to Tarlenheim, rouse theMarshal, and march in force to Zenda. For if not there, I should be dead;and I knew that the King would not be alive five minutes after I ceased tobreathe. I must now leave Sapt and his friends, and relate how I myselfproceeded on this eventful night. I went out on the good horse which hadcarried me, on the night of the coronation, back from the hunting-lodge toStrelsau. I carried a revolver in the saddle and my sword. I was coveredwith a large cloak, and under this I wore a warm, tight-fitting woollenjersey, a pair of knickerbockers, thick stockings, and light canvas shoes. Ihad rubbed myself thoroughly with oil, and I carried a large flask ofwhisky. The night was warm, but I might probably be immersed a longwhile, and it was necessary to take every precaution against cold: for coldnot only saps a man's courage if he has to die, but impairs his energy ifothers have to die, and, finally, gives him rheumatics, if it be God's willthat he lives. Also I tied round my body a length of thin but stout cord, andI did not forget my ladder. I, starting after Sapt, took a shorter route,skirting the town to the left, and found myself in the outskirts of the forestat about half-past twelve. I tied my horse up in a thick clump of trees,leaving the revolver in its pocket in the saddle--it would be no use to me-and,ladder in hand, made my way to the edge of the moat. Here Iunwound my rope from about my waist, bound it securely round the trunkof a tree on the bank, and let myself down. The Castle clock struck aquarter to one as I felt the water under me and began to swim round thekeep, pushing the ladder before me, and hugging the Castle wall. Thusvoyaging, I came to my old friend, "Jacob's Ladder," and felt the ledge ofthe masonry under me. I crouched down in the shadow of the great pipe--Itried to stir it, but it was quite immovable--and waited. I remember thatmy predominant feeling was neither anxiety for the King nor longing forFlavia, but an intense desire to smoke; and this craving, of course, I couldnot gratify.</p> 
<p>　　The drawbridge was still in its place. I saw its airy, slight frameworkabove me, some ten yards to my right, as I crouched with my back againstthe wall of the King's cell. I made out a window two yards my side of it and nearly on the same level. That, if Johann spoke true, must belong tothe duke's apartments; and on the other side, in about the same relativeposition, must be Madame de Mauban's window. Women are careless,forgetful creatures. I prayed that she might not forget that she was to bethe victim of a brutal attempt at two o'clock precisely. I was rather amusedat the part I had assigned to my young friend Rupert Hentzau; but I owedhim a stroke--for, even as I sat, my shoulder ached where he had, with anaudacity that seemed half to hide his treachery, struck at me, in the sight ofall my friends, on the terrace at Tarlenheim.</p> 
<p>　　Suddenly the duke's window grew bright. The shutters were not closed,and the interior became partially visible to me as I cautiously raisedmyself till I stood on tiptoe. Thus placed, my range of sight embraced ayard or more inside the window, while the radius of light did not reach me.</p> 
<p>　　The window was flung open and someone looked out. I marked Antoinettede Mauban's graceful figure, and, though her face was in shadow, the fineoutline of her head was revealed against the light behind. I longed to crysoftly, "Remember!" but I dared not--and happily, for a moment later aman came up and stood by her. He tried to put his arm round her waist, butwith a swift motion she sprang away and leant against the shutter, herprofile towards me. I made out who the newcomer was: it was youngRupert. A low laugh from him made me sure, as he leant forward,stretching out his hand towards her.</p> 
<p>　　"Gently, gently!" I murmured. "You're too soon, my boy!"His head was close to hers. I suppose he whispered to her, for I sawher point to the moat, and I heard her say, in slow and distinct tones:</p> 
<p>　　"I had rather throw myself out of this window!"He came close up to the window and looked out.</p> 
<p>　　"It looks cold," said he. "Come, Antoinette, are you serious?"She made no answer so far as I heard; and he smiting his handpetulantly on the window-sill, went on, in the voice of some spoilt child:</p> 
<p>　　"Hang Black Michael! Isn't the princess enough for him? Is he to haveeverything? What the devil do you see in Black Michael?""If I told him what you say--" she began.</p> 
<p>　　"Well, tell him," said Rupert, carelessly; and, catching her off her guard, he sprang forward and kissed her, laughing, and crying, "There'ssomething to tell him!"If I had kept my revolver with me, I should have been very sorelytempted. Being spared the temptation, I merely added this new score to hisaccount.</p> 
<p>　　"Though, faith," said Rupert, "it's little he cares. He's mad about theprincess, you know. He talks of nothing but cutting the play-actor'sthroat."Didn't he, indeed?</p> 
<p>　　"And if I do it for him, what do you think he's promised me?"The unhappy woman raised her hands above her head, in prayer or indespair.</p> 
<p>　　"But I detest waiting," said Rupert; and I saw that he was about to layhis hand on her again, when there was a noise of a door in the roomopening, and a harsh voice cried:</p> 
<p>　　"What are you doing here, sir?"Rupert turned his back to the window, bowed low, and said, in his loud,merry tones: "Apologizing for your absence, sir. Could I leave the ladyalone?"The newcomer must be Black Michael. I saw him directly, as headvanced towards the window. He caught young Rupert by the arm.</p> 
<p>　　"The moat would hold more than the King!" said he, with a significantgesture.</p> 
<p>　　"Does your Highness threaten me?" asked Rupert.</p> 
<p>　　"A threat is more warning than most men get from me.""Yet," observed Rupert, "Rudolf Rassendyll has been much threatened,and yet lives!""Am I in fault because my servants bungle?" asked Michael scornfully.</p> 
<p>　　"Your Highness has run no risk of bungling!" sneered Rupert.</p> 
<p>　　It was telling the duke that he shirked danger as plain as ever I haveheard a man told. Black Michael had self-control. I dare say he scowled--itwas a great regret to me that I could not see their faces better--but hisvoice was even and calm, as he answered:</p> 
<p>　　"Enough, enough! We mustn't quarrel, Rupert. Are Detchard and Bersonin at their posts?""They are, sir.""I need you no more.""Nay, I'm not oppressed with fatigue," said Rupert.</p> 
<p>　　"Pray, sir, leave us," said Michael, more impatiently. "In ten minutesthe drawbridge will be drawn back, and I presume you have no wish toswim to your bed."Rupert's figure disappeared. I heard the door open and shut again.</p> 
<p>　　Michael and Antoinette de Mauban were left together. To my chagrin, theduke laid his hand on the window and closed it. He stood talking toAntoinette for a moment or two. She shook her head, and he turnedimpatiently away. She left the window. The door sounded again, and BlackMichael closed the shutters.</p> 
<p>　　"De Gautet, De Gautet, man!" sounded from the drawbridge. "Unlessyou want a bath before your bed, come along!"It was Rupert's voice, coming from the end of the drawbridge. Amoment later he and De Gautet stepped out on the bridge. Rupert's armwas through De Gautet's, and in the middle of the bridge he detained hiscompanion and leant over. I dropped behind the shelter of "Jacob'sLadder."Then Master Rupert had a little sport. He took from De Gautet a bottlewhich he carried, and put it to his lips.</p> 
<p>　　"Hardly a drop!" he cried discontentedly, and flung it in the moat.</p> 
<p>　　It fell, as I judged from the sound and the circles on the water, within ayard of the pipe. And Rupert, taking out his revolver, began to shoot at it.</p> 
<p>　　The first two shots missed the bottle, but hit the pipe. The third shatteredthe bottle. I hoped that the young ruffian would be content; but he emptiedthe other barrels at the pipe, and one, skimming over the pipe, whistledthrough my hair as I crouched on the other side.</p> 
<p>　　"'Ware bridge!" a voice cried, to my relief.</p> 
<p>　　Rupert and De Gautet cried, "A moment!" and ran across. The bridgewas drawn back, and all became still. The clock struck a quarter-past one.</p> 
<p>　　I rose and stretched myself and yawned.</p> 
<p>　　I think some ten minutes had passed when I heard a slight noise to my right. I peered over the pipe, and saw a dark figure standing in the gatewaythat led to the bridge. It was a man. By the careless, graceful poise, Iguessed it to be Rupert again. He held a sword in his hand, and he stoodmotionless for a minute or two. Wild thoughts ran through me. On whatmischief was the young fiend bent now? Then he laughed low to himself;then he turned his face to the wall, took a step in my direction, and, to mysurprise, began to climb down the wall. In an instant I saw that there mustbe steps in the wall; it was plain. They were cut into or affixed to the wall,at intervals of about eighteen inches. Rupert set his foot on the lower one.</p> 
<p>　　Then he placed his sword between his teeth, turned round, and noiselesslylet himself into the water. Had it been a matter of my life only, I wouldhave swum to meet him. Dearly would I have loved to fight it out withhim then and there--with steel, on a fine night, and none to come betweenus. But there was the King! I restrained myself, but I could not bridle myswift breathing, and I watched him with the intensest eagerness.</p> 
<p>　　He swam leisurely and quietly across. There were more steps up on theother side, and he climbed them. When he set foot in the gateway, standingon the drawn-back bridge, he felt in his pocket and took something out. Iheard him unlock the door. I could hear no noise of its closing behind him.</p> 
<p>　　He vanished from my sight.</p> 
<p>　　Abandoning my ladder--I saw I did not need it now--I swam to theside of the bridge and climbed half way up the steps. There I hung withmy sword in my hand, listening eagerly. The duke's room was shutteredand dark. There was a light in the window on the opposite side of thebridge. Not a sound broke the silence, till half-past one chimed from thegreat clock in the tower of the chateau.</p> 
<p>　　There were other plots than mine afoot in the Castle that night.</p>
