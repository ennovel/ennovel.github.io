I marked theeffect on the garrison of Zenda: they ceased to be seen abroad; and any ofmy men who went near the Castle reported that the utmost vigilanceprevailed there. Touched as I was by Madame de Mauban's appeal, Iseemed as powerless to befriend her as I had proved to help the King.</p> 
<p>　　Michael bade me defiance; and although he too had been seen outside thewalls, with more disregard for appearances than he had hitherto shown, hedid not take the trouble to send any excuse for his failure to wait on theKing. Time ran on in inactivity, when every moment was pressing; for notonly was I faced with the new danger which the stir about mydisappearance brought on me, but great murmurs had arisen in Strelsau atmy continued absence from the city. They had been greater, but for theknowledge that Flavia was with me; and for this reason I suffered her tostay, though I hated to have her where danger was, and though every dayof our present sweet intercourse strained my endurance almost to breaking.</p> 
<p>　　As a final blow, nothing would content my advisers, Strakencz and theChancellor (who came out from Strelsau to make an urgent representationto me), save that I should appoint a day for the public solemnization of mybetrothal, a ceremony which in Ruritania is well nigh as binding and greata thing as the marriage itself. And this--with Flavia sitting by me-- I wasforced to do, setting a date a fortnight ahead, and appointing the Cathedralin Strelsau as the place. And this formal act being published far and wide,caused great joy throughout the kingdom, and was the talk of all tongues;so that I reckoned there were but two men who chafed at it--I mean BlackMichael and myself; and but one who did not know of it--that one the manwhose name I bore, the King of Ruritania.</p> 
<p>　　In truth, I heard something of the way the news was received in theCastle; for after an interval of three days, the man Johann, greedy for moremoney, though fearful for his life, again found means to visit us. He had been waiting on the duke when the tidings came. Black Michael's face hadgrown blacker still, and he had sworn savagely; nor was he better pleasedwhen young Rupert took oath that I meant to do as I said, and turning toMadame de Mauban, wished her joy on a rival gone. Michael's hand stoletowards his sword (said Johann), but not a bit did Rupert care; for herallied the duke on having made a better King than had reigned for yearspast in Ruritania. "And," said he, with a meaning bow to his exasperatedmaster, "the devil sends the princess a finer man than heaven had markedout for her, by my soul, it does!" Then Michael harshly bade him hold histongue, and leave them; but Rupert must needs first kiss madame's hand,which he did as though he loved her, while Michael glared at him.</p> 
<p>　　This was the lighter side of the fellow's news; but more serious camebehind, and it was plain that if time pressed at Tarlenheim, it pressed nonethe less fiercely at Zenda. For the King was very sick: Johann had seenhim, and he was wasted and hardly able to move. "There could be nothought of taking another for him now." So alarmed were they, that theyhad sent for a physician from Strelsau; and the physician having beenintroduced into the King's cell, had come forth pale and trembling, andurgently prayed the duke to let him go back and meddle no more in theaffair; but the duke would not, and held him there a prisoner, telling himhis life was safe if the King lived while the duke desired and died whenthe duke desired--not otherwise. And, persuaded by the physician, theyhad allowed Madame de Mauban to visit the King and give him suchattendance as his state needed, and as only a woman can give. Yet his lifehung in the balance; and I was still strong and whole and free. Whereforegreat gloom reigned at Zenda; and save when they quarrelled, to whichthey were very prone, they hardly spoke. But the deeper the depression ofthe rest, young Rupert went about Satan's work with a smile in his eye anda song on his lip; and laughed "fit to burst" (said Johann) because the dukealways set Detchard to guard the King when Madame de Mauban was inthe cell--which precaution was, indeed, not unwise in my careful brother.</p> 
<p>　　Thus Johann told his tale and seized his crowns. Yet he besought us toallow him to stay with us in Tarlenheim, and not venture his head again inthe lion's den; but we had need of him there, and, although I refused to constrain him, I prevailed on him by increased rewards to go back andcarry tidings to Madame de Mauban that I was working for her, and that, ifshe could, she should speak one word of comfort to the King. For whilesuspense is bad for the sick, yet despair is worse still, and it might be thatthe King lay dying of mere hopelessness, for I could learn of no definitedisease that afflicted him.</p> 
<p>　　"And how do they guard the King now?" I asked, remembering thattwo of the Six were dead, and Max Holf also.</p> 
<p>　　"Detchard and Bersonin watch by night, Rupert Hentzau and DeGautet by day, sir," he answered.</p> 
<p>　　"Only two at a time?""Ay, sir; but the others rest in a room just above, and are within soundof a cry or a whistle.""A room just above? I didn't know of that. Is there any communicationbetween it and the room where they watch?""No, sir. You must go down a few stairs and through the door by thedrawbridge, and so to where the King is lodged.""And that door is locked?""Only the four lords have keys, sir."I drew nearer to him.</p> 
<p>　　"And have they keys of the grating?" I asked in a low whisper.</p> 
<p>　　"I think, sir, only Detchard and Rupert.""Where does the duke lodge?""In the chateau, on the first floor. His apartments are on the right asyou go towards the drawbridge.""And Madame de Mauban?""Just opposite, on the left. But her door is locked after she hasentered.""To keep her in?""Doubtless, sir.""Perhaps for another reason?""It is possible.""And the duke, I suppose, has the key?""Yes. And the drawbridge is drawn back at night, and of that, too, the duke holds the key, so that it cannot be run across the moat withoutapplication to him.""And where do you sleep?""In the entrance hall of the chateau, with five servants.""Armed?""They have pikes, sir, but no firearms. The duke will not trust themwith firearms."Then at last I took the matter boldly in my hands. I had failed once at"Jacob's Ladder;" I should fail again there. I must make the attack from theother side.</p> 
<p>　　"I have promised you twenty thousand crowns," said I. "You shall havefifty thousand if you will do what I ask of you tomorrow night. But, first,do those servants know who your prisoner is?""No, sir. They believe him to be some private enemy of the duke's.""And they would not doubt that I am the King?""How should they?" he asked.</p> 
<p>　　"Look to this, then. Tomorrow, at two in the morning exactly, flingopen the front door of the chateau. Don't fail by an instant.""Shall you be there, sir?""Ask no questions. Do what I tell you. Say the hall is close, or whatyou will. That is all I ask of you.""And may I escape by the door, sir, when I have opened it?""Yes, as quick as your legs will carry you. One thing more. Carry thisnote to madame--oh, it's in French, you can't read it-- and charge her, forthe sake of all our lives, not to fail in what it orders."The man was trembling but I had to trust to what he had of courageand to what he had of honesty. I dared not wait, for I feared that the Kingwould die.</p> 
<p>　　When the fellow was gone, I called Sapt and Fritz to me, and unfoldedthe plan that I had formed. Sapt shook his head over it.</p> 
<p>　　"Why can't you wait?" he asked.</p> 
<p>　　"The King may die.""Michael will be forced to act before that.""Then," said I, "the King may live.""Well, and if he does?""For a fortnight?" I asked simply.</p> 
<p>　　And Sapt bit his moustache.</p> 
<p>　　Suddenly Fritz von Tarlenheim laid his hand on my shoulder.</p> 
<p>　　"Let us go and make the attempt," said he.</p> 
<p>　　"I mean you to go--don't be afraid," said I.</p> 
<p>　　"Ay, but do you stay here, and take care of the princess."A gleam came into old Sapt's eye.</p> 
<p>　　"We should have Michael one way or the other then," he chuckled;"whereas if you go and are killed with the King, what will become ofthose of us who are left?""They will serve Queen Flavia," said I, "and I would to God I could beone of them."A pause followed. Old Sapt broke it by saying sadly, yet with anunmeant drollery that set Fritz and me laughing:</p> 
<p>　　"Why didn't old Rudolf the Third marry your--great-grandmother, wasit?""Come," said I, "it is the King we are thinking about.""It is true," said Fritz.</p> 
<p>　　"Moreover," I went on, "I have been an impostor for the profit ofanother, but I will not be one for my own; and if the King is not alive andon his throne before the day of betrothal comes, I will tell the truth, comewhat may.""You shall go, lad," said Sapt.</p> 
<p>　　Here is the plan I had made. A strong party under Sapt's command wasto steal up to the door of the chateau. If discovered prematurely, they wereto kill anyone who found them--with their swords, for I wanted no noise offiring. If all went well, they would be at the door when Johann opened it.</p> 
<p>　　They were to rush in and secure the servants if their mere presence and theuse of the King's name were not enough. At the same moment--and on thishinged the plan--a woman's cry was to ring out loud and shrill fromAntoinette de Mauban's chamber. Again and again she was to cry: "Help,help! Michael, help!" and then to utter the name of young Rupert Hentzau.</p> 
<p>　　Then, as we hoped, Michael, in fury, would rush out of his apartments opposite, and fall alive into the hands of Sapt. Still the cries would go on;and my men would let down the drawbridge; and it would be strange ifRupert, hearing his name thus taken in vain, did not descend from wherehe slept and seek to cross. De Gautet might or might not come with him:</p> 
<p>　　that must be left to chance.</p> 
<p>　　And when Rupert set his foot on the drawbridge? There was my part:</p> 
<p>　　for I was minded for another swim in the moat; and, lest I should growweary, I had resolved to take with me a small wooden ladder, on which Icould rest my arms in the water--and my feet when I left it. I would rear itagainst the wall just by the bridge; and when the bridge was across, Iwould stealthily creep on to it--and then if Rupert or De Gautet crossed insafety, it would be my misfortune, not my fault. They dead, two men onlywould remain; and for them we must trust to the confusion we had createdand to a sudden rush. We should have the keys of the door that led to theall-important rooms. Perhaps they would rush out. If they stood by theirorders, then the King's life hung on the swiftness with which we couldforce the outer door; and I thanked God that not Rupert Hentzau watched,but Detchard. For though Detchard was a cool man, relentless, and nocoward, he had neither the dash nor the recklessness of Rupert. Moreover,he, if any one of them, really loved Black Michael, and it might be that hewould leave Bersonin to guard the King, and rush across the bridge to takepart in the affray on the other side.</p> 
<p>　　So I planned--desperately. And, that our enemy might be the betterlulled to security, I gave orders that our residence should be brilliantlylighted from top to bottom, as though we were engaged in revelry; andshould so be kept all night, with music playing and people moving to andfro. Strakencz would be there, and he was to conceal our departure, if hecould, from Flavia. And if we came not again by the morning, he was tomarch, openly and in force to the Castle, and demand the person of theKing; if Black Michael were not there, as I did not think he would be, theMarshal would take Flavia with him, as swiftly as he could, to Strelsau,and there proclaim Black Michael's treachery and the probable death ofthe King, and rally all that there was honest and true round the banner ofthe princess. And, to say truth, this was what I thought most likely to happen. For I had great doubts whether either the King or Black Michaelor I had more than a day to live. Well, if Black Michael died, and if I, theplay-actor, slew Rupert Hentzau with my own hand, and then died myself,it might be that Fate would deal as lightly with Ruritania as could behoped, notwithstanding that she demanded the life of the King--and to herdealing thus with me, I was in no temper to make objection.</p> 
<p>　　It was late when we rose from conference, and I betook me to theprincess's apartments. She was pensive that evening; yet, when I left her,she flung her arms about me and grew, for an instant, bashfully radiant asshe slipped a ring on my finger. I was wearing the King's ring; but I hadalso on my little finger a plain band of gold engraved with the motto ofour family: "Nil Quae Feci." This I took off and put on her, and signed toher to let me go. And she, understanding, stood away and watched me withdimmed eyes.</p> 
<p>　　"Wear that ring, even though you wear another when you are queen," Isaid.</p> 
<p>　　"Whatever else I wear, this I will wear till I die and after," said she, asshe kissed the ring.</p>
