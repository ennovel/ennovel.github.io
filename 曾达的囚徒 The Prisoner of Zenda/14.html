I caused the bulletins to be of a very seriouscharacter, and created great public excitement, whereby three thingsoccurred: first, I gravely offended the medical faculty of Strelsau byrefusing to summon to my bedside any of them, save a young man, afriend of Fritz's, whom we could trust; secondly, I received word fromMarshal Strakencz that my orders seemed to have no more weight than his,and that the Princess Flavia was leaving for Tarlenheim under hisunwilling escort (news whereat I strove not to be glad and proud); andthirdly, my brother, the Duke of Strelsau, although too well informed tobelieve the account of the origin of my sickness, was yet persuaded by thereports and by my seeming inactivity that I was in truth incapable ofaction, and that my life was in some danger. This I learnt from the manJohann, whom I was compelled to trust and send back to Zenda, where, bythe way, Rupert Hentzau had him soundly flogged for daring to smirch themorals of Zenda by staying out all night in the pursuits of love. This, fromRupert, Johann deeply resented, and the duke's approval of it did more tobind the keeper to my side than all my promises.</p> 
<p>　　On Flavia's arrival I cannot dwell. Her joy at finding me up and well,instead of on my back and fighting with death, makes a picture that evennow dances before my eyes till they grow too dim to see it; and herreproaches that I had not trusted even her must excuse the means I took toquiet them. In truth, to have her with me once more was like a taste ofheaven to a damned soul, the sweeter for the inevitable doom that was tofollow; and I rejoiced in being able to waste two whole days with her. Andwhen I had wasted two days, the Duke of Strelsau arranged a hunting-party.</p> 
<p>　　The stroke was near now. For Sapt and I, after anxious consultations, had resolved that we must risk a blow, our resolution being clinched byJohann's news that the King grew peaked, pale, and ill, and that his healthwas breaking down under his rigorous confinement. Now a man--be heking or no king--may as well die swiftly and as becomes a gentleman,from bullet or thrust, as rot his life out in a cellar! That thought madeprompt action advisable in the interests of the King; from my own point ofview, it grew more and more necessary. For Strakencz urged on me theneed of a speedy marriage, and my own inclinations seconded him withsuch terrible insistence that I feared for my resolution. I do not believe thatI should have done the deed I dreamt of; but I might have come to flight,and my flight would have ruined the cause. And--yes, I am no saint (askmy little sister-in-law), and worse still might have happened.</p> 
<p>　　It is perhaps as strange a thing as has ever been in the history of acountry that the King's brother and the King's personator, in a time ofprofound outward peace, near a placid, undisturbed country town, undersemblance of amity, should wage a desperate war for the person and life ofthe King. Yet such was the struggle that began now between Zenda andTarlenheim. When I look back on the time, I seem to myself to have beenhalf mad. Sapt has told me that I suffered no interference and listened tono remonstrances; and if ever a King of Ruritania ruled like a despot, Iwas, in those days, the man. Look where I would, I saw nothing that madelife sweet to me, and I took my life in my hand and carried it carelessly asa man dangles an old glove. At first they strove to guard me, to keep mesafe, to persuade me not to expose myself; but when they saw how I wasset, there grew up among them--whether they knew the truth or not-- afeeling that Fate ruled the issue, and that I must be left to play my gamewith Michael my own way.</p> 
<p>　　Late next night I rose from table, where Flavia had sat by me, andconducted her to the door of her apartments. There I kissed her hand, andbade her sleep sound and wake to happy days. Then I changed my clothesand went out. Sapt and Fritz were waiting for me with six men and thehorses. Over his saddle Sapt carried a long coil of rope, and both wereheavily armed. I had with me a short stout cudgel and a long knife.</p> 
<p>　　Making a circuit, we avoided the town, and in an hour found ourselves slowly mounting the hill that led to the Castle of Zenda. The night wasdark and very stormy; gusts of wind and spits of rain caught us as webreasted the incline, and the great trees moaned and sighed. When wecame to a thick clump, about a quarter of a mile from the Castle, we badeour six friends hide there with the horses. Sapt had a whistle, and theycould rejoin us in a few moments if danger came: but, up to now, we hadmet no one. I hoped that Michael was still off his guard, believing me tobe safe in bed. However that might be, we gained the top of the hillwithout accident, and found ourselves on the edge of the moat where itsweeps under the road, separating the Old Castle from it. A tree stood onthe edge of the bank, and Sapt,silently and diligently, set to make fast therope. I stripped off my boots, took a pull at a flask of brandy, loosened theknife in its sheath, and took the cudgel between my teeth. Then I shookhands with my friends, not heeding a last look of entreaty from Fritz, andlaid hold of the rope. I was going to have a look at "Jacob's Ladder."Gently I lowered myself into the water. Though the night was wild, theday had been warm and bright, and the water was not cold. I struck out,and began to swim round the great walls which frowned above me. I couldsee only three yards ahead; I had then good hopes of not being seen, as Icrept along close under the damp, moss-grown masonry. There were lightsfrom the new part of the Castle on the other side, and now and again Iheard laughter and merry shouts. I fancied I recognized young RupertHentzau's ringing tones, and pictured him flushed with wine. Recalling mythoughts to the business in hand, I rested a moment. If Johann'sdescription were right, I must be near the window now. Very slowly Imoved; and out of the darkness ahead loomed a shape. It was the pipe,curving from the window to the water: about four feet of its surface weredisplayed; it was as big round as two men. I was about to approach it,when I saw something else, and my heart stood still. The nose of a boatprotruded beyond the pipe on the other side; and listening intently, I hearda slight shuffle--as of a man shifting his position. Who was the man whoguarded Michael's invention? Was he awake or was he asleep? I felt if myknife were ready, and trod water; as I did so, I found bottom under my feet.</p> 
<p>　　The foundations of the Castle extended some fifteen inches, making a ledge; and I stood on it, out of water from my armpits upwards. Then Icrouched and peered through the darkness under the pipe, where, curving,it left a space.</p> 
<p>　　There was a man in the boat. A rifle lay by him--I saw the gleam of thebarrel. Here was the sentinel! He sat very still. I listened; he breathedheavily, regularly, monotonously. By heaven, he slept! Kneeling on theshelf, I drew forward under the pipe till my face was within two feet of his.</p> 
<p>　　He was a big man, I saw. It was Max Holf, the brother of Johann. My handstole to my belt, and I drew out my knife. Of all the deeds of my life, Ilove the least to think of this, and whether it were the act of a man or atraitor I will not ask. I said to myself: "It is war--and the King's life is thestake." And I raised myself from beneath the pipe and stood up by the boat,which lay moored by the ledge. Holding my breath, I marked the spot andraised my arm. The great fellow stirred. He opened his eyes--wide, wider.</p> 
<p>　　He grasped in terror at my face and clutched at his rifle. I struck home.</p> 
<p>　　And I heard the chorus of a love-song from the opposite bank.</p> 
<p>　　Leaving him where he lay, a huddled mass, I turned to "Jacob'sLadder." My time was short. This fellow's turn of watching might be overdirectly, and relief would come. Leaning over the pipe, I examined it, fromthe end near the water to the topmost extremity where it passed, or seemedto pass, through the masonry of the wall. There was no break in it, nochink. Dropping on my knees, I tested the under side. And my breath wentquick and fast, for on this lower side, where the pipe should have clungclose to the masonry, there was a gleam of light! That light must comefrom the cell of the King! I set my shoulder against the pipe and exertedmy strength. The chink widened a very, very little, and hastily I desisted; Ihad done enough to show that the pipe was not fixed in the masonry at thelower side.</p> 
<p>　　Then I heard a voice--a harsh, grating voice:</p> 
<p>　　"Well, sire, if you have had enough of my society, I will leave you torepose; but I must fasten the little ornaments first."It was Detchard! I caught the English accent in a moment.</p> 
<p>　　"Have you anything to ask, sire, before we part?"The King's voice followed. It was his, though it was faint and hollow-different from the merry tones I had heard in the glades of the forest.</p> 
<p>　　"Pray my brother," said the King, "to kill me. I am dying by incheshere.""The duke does not desire your death, sire--yet," sneered Detchard;"when he does behold your path to heaven!"The King answered:</p> 
<p>　　"So be it! And now, if your orders allow it, pray leave me.""May you dream of paradise!" said the ruffian.</p> 
<p>　　The light disappeared. I heard the bolts of the door run home. And thenI heard the sobs of the King. He was alone, as he thought. Who daresmock at him?</p> 
<p>　　I did not venture to speak to him. The risk of some exclamationescaping him in surprise was too great. I dared do nothing that night; andmy task now was to get myself away in safety, and to carry off the carcassof the dead man. To leave him there would tell too much. Casting loosethe boat, I got in. The wind was blowing a gale now, and there was littledanger of oars being heard. I rowed swiftly round to where my friendswaited. I had just reached the spot, when a loud whistle sounded over themoat behind me.</p> 
<p>　　"Hullo, Max!" I heard shouted.</p> 
<p>　　I hailed Sapt in a low tone. The rope came down. I tied it round thecorpse, and then went up it myself.</p> 
<p>　　"Whistle you too," I whispered, "for our men, and haul in the line. Notalk now."They hauled up the body. Just as it reached the road, three men onhorseback swept round from the front of the Castle. We saw them; but,being on foot ourselves, we escaped their notice. But we heard our mencoming up with a shout.</p> 
<p>　　"The devil, but it's dark!" cried a ringing voice.</p> 
<p>　　It was young Rupert. A moment later, shots rang out. Our people hadmet them. I started forward at a run, Sapt and Fritz following me.</p> 
<p>　　"Thrust, thrust!" cried Rupert again, and a loud groan following toldthat he himself was not behind-hand.</p> 
<p>　　"I'm done, Rupert!" cried a voice. "They're three to one. Save yourself!"I ran on, holding my cudgel in my hand. Suddenly a horse cametowards me. A man was on it, leaning over his shoulder.</p> 
<p>　　"Are you cooked too, Krafstein?" he cried.</p> 
<p>　　There was no answer.</p> 
<p>　　I sprang to the horse's head. It was Rupert Hentzau.</p> 
<p>　　"At last!" I cried.</p> 
<p>　　For we seemed to have him. He had only his sword in his hand. Mymen were hot upon him; Sapt and Fritz were running up. I had outstrippedthem; but if they got close enough to fire, he must die or surrender.</p> 
<p>　　"At last!" I cried.</p> 
<p>　　"It's the play-actor!" cried he, slashing at my cudgel. He cut it clean intwo; and, judging discretion better than death, I ducked my head and (Iblush to tell it) scampered for my life. The devil was in Rupert Hentzau;for he put spurs to his horse, and I, turning to look, saw him ride, fullgallop, to the edge of the moat and leap in, while the shots of our party fellthick round him like hail. With one gleam of moonlight we should haveriddled him with balls; but, in the darkness, he won to the corner of theCastle, and vanished from our sight.</p> 
<p>　　"The deuce take him!" grinned Sapt.</p> 
<p>　　"It's a pity," said I, "that he's a villain. Whom have we got?"We had Lauengram and Krafstein: they lay dead; and, concealmentbeing no longer possible, we flung them, with Max, into the moat; and,drawing together in a compact body, rode off down the hill. And, in ourmidst, went the bodies of three gallant gentlemen. Thus we travelled home,heavy at heart for the death of our friends, sore uneasy concerning theKing, and cut to the quick that young Rupert had played yet anotherwinning hand with us.</p> 
<p>　　For my own part, I was vexed and angry that I had killed no man inopen fight, but only stabbed a knave in his sleep. And I did not love tohear Rupert call me a play-actor.</p>
