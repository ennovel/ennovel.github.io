Butsoon the scene grew clear: and it was a strange scene. The bridge was inits place. At the far end of it stood a group of the duke's servants; two orthree carried the lights which had dazzled me, three or four held pikes inrest. They were huddled together; their weapons were protruded beforethem; their faces were pale and agitated. To put it plainly, they looked inas arrant a fright as I have seen men look, and they gazed apprehensivelyat a man who stood in the middle of the bridge, sword in hand. RupertHentzau was in his trousers and shirt; the white linen was stained withblood, but his easy, buoyant pose told me that he was himself either nottouched at all or merely scratched. There he stood, holding the bridgeagainst them, and daring them to come on; or, rather, bidding them sendBlack Michael to him; and they, having no firearms, cowered before thedesperate man and dared not attack him. They whispered to one another;and in the backmost rank, I saw my friend Johann, leaning against theportal of the door and stanching with a handkerchief the blood whichflowed from a wound in his cheek.</p> 
<p>　　By marvellous chance, I was master. The cravens would oppose me nomore than they dared attack Rupert. I had but to raise my revolver, and Isent him to his account with his sins on his head. He did not so much asknow that I was there. I did nothing--why, I hardly know to this day. I hadkilled one man stealthily that night, and another by luck rather than skill-perhapsit was that. Again, villain as the man was, I did not relish beingone of a crowd against him--perhaps it was that. But stronger than eitherof these restrained feelings came a curiosity and a fascination which heldme spellbound, watching for the outcome of the scene.</p> 
<p>　　"Michael, you dog! Michael! If you can stand, come on!" cried Rupert;and he advanced a step, the group shrinking back a little before him.</p> 
<p>　　"Michael, you bastard! Come on!"The answer to his taunts came in the wild cry of a woman:</p> 
<p>　　"He's dead! My God, he's dead!""Dead!" shouted Rupert. "I struck better than I knew!" and he laughedtriumphantly. Then he went on: "Down with your weapons there! I'm yourmaster now! Down with them, I say!"I believe they would have obeyed, but as he spoke came new things.</p> 
<p>　　First, there arose a distant sound, as of shouts and knockings from theother side of the chateau. My heart leapt. It must be my men, come by ahappy disobedience to seek me. The noise continued, but none of the restseemed to heed it. Their attention was chained by what now happenedbefore their eyes. The group of servants parted and a woman staggered onto the bridge. Antoinette de Mauban was in a loose white robe, her darkhair streamed over her shoulders, her face was ghastly pale, and her eyesgleamed wildly in the light of the torches. In her shaking hand she held arevolver, and, as she tottered forward, she fired it at Rupert Hentzau. Theball missed him, and struck the woodwork over my head.</p> 
<p>　　"Faith, madame," laughed Rupert, "had your eyes been no more deadlythan your shooting, I had not been in this scrape--nor Black Michael inhell--tonight!"She took no notice of his words. With a wonderful effort, she calmedherself till she stood still and rigid. Then very slowly and deliberately shebegan to raise her arm again, taking most careful aim.</p> 
<p>　　He would be mad to risk it. He must rush on her, chancing the bullet,or retreat towards me. I covered him with my weapon.</p> 
<p>　　He did neither. Before she had got her aim, he bowed in his mostgraceful fashion, cried "I can't kill where I've kissed," and before she or Icould stop him, laid his hand on the parapet of the bridge, and lightly leaptinto the moat.</p> 
<p>　　At that very moment I heard a rush of feet, and a voice I knew--Sapt's- cry: "God! it's the duke--dead!" Then I knew that the King needed me nomore, and throwing down my revolver, I sprang out on the bridge. Therewas a cry of wild wonder, "The King!" and then I, like Rupert of Hentzau,sword in hand, vaulted over the parapet, intent on finishing my quarrelwith him where I saw his curly head fifteen yards off in the water of the moat.</p> 
<p>　　He swam swiftly and easily. I was weary and half crippled with mywounded arm. I could not gain on him. For a time I made no sound, but aswe rounded the corner of the old keep I cried:</p> 
<p>　　"Stop, Rupert, stop!"I saw him look over his shoulder, but he swam on. He was under thebank now, searching, as I guessed, for a spot that he could climb. I knewthere to be none--but there was my rope, which would still be hangingwhere I had left it. He would come to where it was before I could. Perhapshe would miss it-- perhaps he would find it; and if he drew it up after him,he would get a good start of me. I put forth all my remaining strength andpressed on. At last I began to gain on him; for he, occupied with his search,unconsciously slackened his pace.</p> 
<p>　　Ah, he had found it! A low shout of triumph came from him. He laidhold of it and began to haul himself up. I was near enough to hear himmutter: "How the devil comes this here?' I was at the rope, and he,hanging in mid air, saw me, but I could not reach him.</p> 
<p>　　"Hullo! who's here?" he cried in startled tones.</p> 
<p>　　For a moment, I believe, he took me for the King--I dare say I waspale enough to lend colour to the thought; but an instant later he cried:</p> 
<p>　　"Why it's the play-actor! How come you here, man?"And so saying he gained the bank.</p> 
<p>　　I laid hold of the rope, but I paused. He stood on the bank, sword inhand, and he could cut my head open or spit me through the heart as Icame up. I let go the rope.</p> 
<p>　　"Never mind," said I; "but as I am here, I think I'll stay."He smiled down on me.</p> 
<p>　　"These women are the deuce--" he began; when suddenly the great bellof the Castle started to ring furiously, and a loud shout reached us from themoat.</p> 
<p>　　Rupert smiled again, and waved his hand to me.</p> 
<p>　　"I should like a turn with you, but it's a little too hot!" said he, and hedisappeared from above me.</p> 
<p>　　In an instant, without thinking of danger, I laid my hand to the rope. I was up. I saw him thirty yards off, running like a deer towards the shelterof the forest. For once Rupert Hentzau had chosen discretion for his part. Ilaid my feet to the ground and rushed after him, calling to him to stand. Hewould not. Unwounded and vigorous, he gained on me at every step; but,forgetting everything in the world except him and my thirst for his blood, Ipressed on, and soon the deep shades of the forest of Zenda engulfed usboth, pursued and pursuer.</p> 
<p>　　It was three o'clock now, and day was dawning. I was on a longstraight grass avenue, and a hundred yards ahead ran young Rupert, hiscurls waving in the fresh breeze. I was weary and panting; he looked overhis shoulder and waved his hand again to me. He was mocking me, for hesaw he had the pace of me. I was forced to pause for breath. A momentlater, Rupert turned sharply to the right and was lost from my sight.</p> 
<p>　　I thought all was over, and in deep vexation sank on the ground. But Iwas up again directly, for a scream rang through the forest-- a woman'sscream. Putting forth the last of my strength, I ran on to the place where hehad turned out of my sight, and, turning also, I saw him again. But alas! Icould not touch him. He was in the act of lifting a girl down from herhorse; doubtless it was her scream that I heard. She looked like a smallfarmer's or a peasant's daughter, and she carried a basket on her arm.</p> 
<p>　　Probably she was on her way to the early market at Zenda. Her horse wasa stout, well shaped animal. Master Rupert lifted her down amid hershrieks--the sight of him frightened her; but he treated her gently, laughed,kissed her, and gave her money. Then he jumped on the horse, sittingsideways like a woman; and then he waited for me. I, on my part, waitedfor him.</p> 
<p>　　Presently he rode towards me, keeping his distance, however. He liftedup his hand, saying:</p> 
<p>　　"What did you in the Castle?" "I killed three of your friends," said I.</p> 
<p>　　"What! You got to the cells?""Yes.""And the King?""He was hurt by Detchard before I killed Detchard, but I pray that helives."131 The Prisoner of Zenda"You fool!" said Rupert, pleasantly.</p> 
<p>　　"One thing more I did.""And what's that?""I spared your life. I was behind you on the bridge, with a revolver inmy hand.""No? Faith, I was between two fires!""Get off your horse," I cried, "and fight like a man.""Before a lady!" said he, pointing to the girl. "Fie, your Majesty!"Then in my rage, hardly knowing what I did, I rushed at him. For amoment he seemed to waver. Then he reined his horse in and stoodwaiting for me. On I went in my folly. I seized the bridle and I struck athim. He parried and thrust at me. I fell back a pace and rushed at himagain; and this time I reached his face and laid his cheek open, and dartedback almost before he could strike me. He seemed almost dazed at thefierceness of my attack; otherwise I think he must have killed me. I sankon my knee panting, expecting him to ride at me. And so he would havedone, and then and there, I doubt not, one or both of us would have died;but at the moment there came a shout from behind us, and, looking round,I saw, just at the turn of the avenue, a man on a horse. He was riding hard,and he carried a revolver in his hand. It was Fritz von Tarlenheim, myfaithful friend. Rupert saw him, and knew that the game was up. Hechecked his rush at me and flung his leg over the saddle, but yet for just amoment he waited. Leaning forward, he tossed his hair off his foreheadand smiled, and said: "Au revoir, Rudolf Rassendyll!"Then, with his cheek streaming blood, but his lips laughing and hisbody swaying with ease and grace, he bowed to me; and he bowed to thefarm-girl, who had drawn near in trembling fascination, and he waved hishand to Fritz, who was just within range and let fly a shot at him. The ballcame nigh doing its work, for it struck the sword he held, and he droppedthe sword with an oath, wringing his fingers and clapped his heels hard onhis horse's belly, and rode away at a gallop.</p> 
<p>　　And I watched him go down the long avenue, riding as though he rodefor his pleasure and singing as he went, for all there was that gash in hischeek.</p> 
<p>　　Once again he turned to wave his hand, and then the gloom of thicketsswallowed him and he was lost from our sight. Thus he vanished--recklessand wary, graceful and graceless, handsome,debonair, vile, andunconquered. And I flung my sword passionately on the ground and criedto Fritz to ride after him. But Fritz stopped his horse, and leapt down andran to me, and knelt, putting his arm about me. And indeed it was time, forthe wound that Detchard had given me was broken forth afresh, and myblood was staining the ground.</p> 
<p>　　"Then give me the horse!" I cried, staggering to my feet and throwinghis arms off me. And the strength of my rage carried me so far as wherethe horse stood, and then I fell prone beside it. And Fritz knelt by meagain.</p> 
<p>　　"Fritz!" I said.</p> 
<p>　　"Ay, friend--dear friend!" he said, tender as a woman.</p> 
<p>　　"Is the King alive?"He took his handkerchief and wiped my lips, and bent and kissed meon the forehead.</p> 
<p>　　"Thanks to the most gallant gentleman that lives," said he softly, "theKing is alive!"The little farm-girl stood by us, weeping for fright and wide-eyed forwonder; for she had seen me at Zenda; and was not I, pallid, dripping, foul,and bloody as I was-- yet was not I the King?</p> 
<p>　　And when I heard that the King was alive, I strove to cry "Hurrah!"But I could not speak, and I laid my head back in Fritz's arms and closedmy eyes, and I groaned; and then, lest Fritz should do me wrong in histhoughts, I opened my eyes and tried to say "Hurrah!" again. But I couldnot. And being very tired, and now very cold, I huddled myself close up toFritz, to get the warmth of him, and shut my eyes again and went to sleep.</p>
