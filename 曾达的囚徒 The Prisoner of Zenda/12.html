It is risingground, and in the centre of the demesne, on the top of the hill, stands afine modern chateau, the property of a distant kinsman of Fritz's, theCount Stanislas von Tarlenheim. Count Stanislas himself was a studentand a recluse. He seldom visited the house, and had, on Fritz's request,very readily and courteously offered me its hospitality for myself and myparty. This, then, was our destination; chosen ostensibly for the sake of theboar-hunting (for the wood was carefully preserved, and boars, oncecommon all over Ruritania, were still to be found there in considerablenumbers), really because it brought us within striking distance of the Dukeof Strelsau's more magnificent dwelling on the other side of the town. Alarge party of servants, with horses and luggage, started early in themorning;we followed at midday, travelling by train for thirty miles, andthen mounting our horses to ride the remaining distance to the chateau.</p> 
<p>　　We were a gallant party. Besides Sapt and Fritz, I was accompanied byten gentlemen: every one of them had been carefully chosen, and no lesscarefully sounded, by my two friends, and all were devotedly attached tothe person of the King. They were told a part of the truth; the attempt onmy life in the summer-house was revealed to them, as a spur to theirloyalty and an incitement against Michael. They were also informed that afriend of the King's was suspected to be forcibly confined within theCastle of Zenda. His rescue was one of the objects of the expedition; but,it was added, the King's main desire was to carry into effect certain stepsagainst his treacherous brother, as to the precise nature of which theycould not at present be further enlightened. Enough that the Kingcommanded their services, and would rely on their devotion whenoccasion arose to call for it. Young, well-bred, brave, and loyal, they askedno more: they were ready to prove their dutiful obedience, and prayed fora fight as the best and most exhilarating mode of showing it.</p> 
<p>　　Thus the scene was shifted from Strelsau to the chateau of Tarlenheimand Castle of Zenda, which frowned at us across the valley. I tried to shiftmy thoughts also, to forget my love, and to bend all my energies to thetask before me. It was to get the King out of the Castle alive. Force wasuseless: in some trick lay the chance; and I had already an inkling of whatwe must do. But I was terribly hampered by the publicity which attendedmy movements. Michael must know by now of my expedition; and I knewMichael too well to suppose that his eyes would be blinded by the feint ofthe boar-hunt. He would understand very well what the real quarry was.</p> 
<p>　　That, however, must be risked--that and all it might mean; for Sapt, no lessthan myself, recognized that the present state of things had becomeunendurable. And there was one thing that I dared to calculate on--not, as Inow know, without warrant. It was this--that Black Michael would notbelieve that I meant well by the King. He could not appreciate--I will notsay an honest man, for the thoughts of my own heart have been revealed-buta man acting honestly. He saw my opportunity as I had seen it, as Sapthad seen it; he knew the princess--nay (and I declare that a sneaking sortof pity for him invaded me), in his way he loved her; he would think thatSapt and Fritz could be bribed, so the bribe was large enough. Thinkingthus, would he kill the King, my rival and my danger? Ay, verily, that hewould, with as little compunction as he would kill a rat. But he would killRudolf Rassendyll first, if he could; and nothing but the certainty of beingutterly damned by the release of the King alive and his restoration to thethrone would drive him to throw away the trump card which he held inreserve to baulk the supposed game of the impudent impostor Rassendyll.</p> 
<p>　　Musing on all this as I rode along, I took courage.</p> 
<p>　　Michael knew of my coming, sure enough. I had not been in the housean hour, when an imposing Embassy arrived from him. He did not quitereach the impudence of sending my would-be assassins, but he sent theother three of his famous Six--the three Ruritanian gentlemen--Lauengram, Krafstein, and Rupert Hentzau. A fine, strapping trio theywere, splendidly horsed and admirably equipped. Young Rupert, wholooked a dare-devil, and could not have been more than twenty-two ortwenty-three, took the lead, and made us the neatest speech, wherein my devoted subject and loving brother Michael of Strelsau, prayed me topardon him for not paying his addresses in person, and, further, for notputting his Castle at my disposal; the reason for both of these apparentderelictions being that he and several of his servants lay sick of scarletfever, and were in a very sad, and also a very infectious state. So declaredyoung Rupert with an insolent smile on his curling upper lip and a toss ofhis thick hair--he was a handsome villain, and the gossip ran that many alady had troubled her heart for him already.</p> 
<p>　　"If my brother has scarlet fever," said I, "he is nearer my complexionthan he is wont to be, my lord. I trust he does not suffer?""He is able to attend to his affairs, sire.""I hope all beneath your roof are not sick. What of my good friends,De Gautet, Bersonin, and Detchard? I heard the last had suffered a hurt."Lauengram and Krafstein looked glum and uneasy, but young Rupert'ssmile grew broader.</p> 
<p>　　"He hopes soon to find a medicine for it, sire," he answered.</p> 
<p>　　And I burst out laughing, for I knew what medicine Detchard longedfor-- it is called Revenge.</p> 
<p>　　"You will dine with us, gentlemen?" I asked.</p> 
<p>　　Young Rupert was profuse in apologies. They had urgent duties at theCastle.</p> 
<p>　　"Then," said I, with a wave of my hand, "to our next meeting,gentlemen. May it make us better acquainted.""We will pray your Majesty for an early opportunity," quoth Rupertairily; and he strode past Sapt with such jeering scorn on his face that Isaw the old fellow clench his fist and scowl black as night.</p> 
<p>　　For my part, if a man must needs be a knave, I would have him adebonair knave, and I liked Rupert Hentzau better than his long-faced,close-eyed companions. It makes your sin no worse, as I conceive, to do ita la mode and stylishly.</p> 
<p>　　Now it was a curious thing that on this first night, instead of eating theexcellent dinner my cooks had prepared for me, I must needs leave mygentlemen to eat it alone, under Sapt's presiding care, and ride myself withFritz to the town of Zenda and a certain little inn that I knew of. There was little danger in the excursion; the evenings were long and light, and theroad this side of Zenda well frequented. So off we rode, with a groombehind us. I muffled myself up in a big cloak.</p> 
<p>　　"Fritz," said I, as we entered the town, "there's an uncommonly prettygirl at this inn.""How do you know?" he asked.</p> 
<p>　　"Because I've been there," said I.</p> 
<p>　　"Since--?" he began.</p> 
<p>　　"No. Before," said I.</p> 
<p>　　"But they'll recognize you?""Well, of course they will. Now, don't argue, my good fellow, butlisten to me. We're two gentlemen of the King's household, and one of ushas a toothache. The other will order a private room and dinner, and,further, a bottle of the best wine for the sufferer. And if he be as clever afellow as I take him for, the pretty girl and no other will wait on us.""What if she won't?" objected Fritz.</p> 
<p>　　"My dear Fritz," said I, "if she won't for you, she will for me."We were at the inn. Nothing of me but my eyes was visible as I walkedin. The landlady received us; two minutes later, my little friend (ever, Ifear me, on the look-out for such guests as might prove amusing) made herappearance. Dinner and the wine were ordered. I sat down in the privateroom. A minute later Fritz came in.</p> 
<p>　　"She's coming," he said.</p> 
<p>　　"If she were not, I should have to doubt the Countess Helga's taste."She came in. I gave her time to set the wine down--I didn't want itdropped. Fritz poured out a glass and gave it to me.</p> 
<p>　　"Is the gentleman in great pain?" the girl asked, sympathetically.</p> 
<p>　　"The gentleman is no worse than when he saw you last," said I,throwing away my cloak.</p> 
<p>　　She started, with a little shriek. Then she cried:</p> 
<p>　　"It was the King, then! I told mother so the moment I saw his picture.</p> 
<p>　　Oh, sir, forgive me!""Faith, you gave me nothing that hurt much," said I.</p> 
<p>　　"But the things we said!""I forgive them for the thing you did.""I must go and tell mother.""Stop," said I, assuming a graver air. "We are not here for sport tonight.</p> 
<p>　　Go and bring dinner, and not a word of the King being here."She came back in a few minutes, looking grave, yet very curious.</p> 
<p>　　"Well, how is Johann?" I asked, beginning my dinner.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, that fellow, sir--my lord King, I mean!"""Sir" will do, please. How is he?""We hardly see him now, sir.""And why not?""I told him he came too often, sir," said she, tossing her head.</p> 
<p>　　"So he sulks and stays away?""Yes, sir.""But you could bring him back?" I suggested with a smile.</p> 
<p>　　"Perhaps I could," said she.</p> 
<p>　　"I know your powers, you see," said I, and she blushed with pleasure.</p> 
<p>　　"It's not only that, sir, that keeps him away. He's very busy at theCastle.""But there's no shooting on now.""No, sir; but he's in charge of the house.""Johann turned housemaid?"The little girl was brimming over with gossip.</p> 
<p>　　"Well, there are no others," said she. "There's not a woman there-- notas a servant, I mean. They do say--but perhaps it's false, sir.""Let's have it for what it's worth," said I.</p> 
<p>　　"Indeed, I'm ashamed to tell you, sir.""Oh, see, I'm looking at the ceiling.""They do say there is a lady there, sir; but, except for her, there's not awoman in the place. And Johann has to wait on the gentlemen.""Poor Johann! He must be overworked. Yet I'm sure he could find halfan hour to come and see you.""It would depend on the time, sir, perhaps.""Do you love him?" I asked.</p> 
<p>　　"Not I, sir.""And you wish to serve the King?""Yes, sir.""Then tell him to meet you at the second milestone out of Zendatomorrow evening at ten o'clock. Say you'll be there and will walk homewith him.""Do you mean him harm, sir?""Not if he will do as I bid him. But I think I've told you enough, mypretty maid. See that you do as I bid you. And, mind, no one is to knowthat the King has been here."I spoke a little sternly, for there is seldom harm in infusing a little fearinto a woman's liking for you, and I softened the effect by giving her ahandsome present. Then we dined, and, wrapping my cloak about my face,with Fritz leading the way, we went downstairs to our horses again.</p> 
<p>　　It was but half-past eight, and hardly yet dark; the streets were full forsuch a quiet little place, and I could see that gossip was all agog. With theKing on one side and the duke on the other, Zenda felt itself the centre ofall Ruritania. We jogged gently through the town, but set our horses to asharper pace when we reached the open country.</p> 
<p>　　"You want to catch this fellow Johann?" asked Fritz.</p> 
<p>　　"Ay, and I fancy I've baited the hook right. Our little Delilah will bringour Samson. It is not enough, Fritz, to have no women in a house, thoughbrother Michael shows some wisdom there. If you want safety, you musthave none within fifty miles.""None nearer than Strelsau, for instance," said poor Fritz, with alovelorn sigh.</p> 
<p>　　We reached the avenue of the chateau, and were soon at the house. Asthe hoofs of our horses sounded on the gravel, Sapt rushed out to meet us.</p> 
<p>　　"Thank God, you're safe!" he cried. "Have you seen anything ofthem?""Of whom?" I asked, dismounting. He drew us aside, that the groomsmight not hear.</p> 
<p>　　"Lad," he said to me, "you must not ride about here, unless with half adozen of us. You know among our men a tall young fellow, Bernenstein byname?"I knew him. He was a fine strapping young man, almost of my height,and of light complexion.</p> 
<p>　　"He lies in his room upstairs, with a bullet through his arm.""The deuce he does!""After dinner he strolled out alone, and went a mile or so into thewood; and as he walked, he thought he saw three men among the trees;and one levelled a gun at him. He had no weapon, and he started at a runback towards the house. But one of them fired, and he was hit, and hadmuch ado to reach here before he fainted. By good luck, they feared topursue him nearer the house."He paused and added:</p> 
<p>　　"Lad, the bullet was meant for you.""It is very likely," said I, "and it's first blood to brother Michael.""I wonder which three it was," said Fritz.</p> 
<p>　　"Well, Sapt," I said, "I went out tonight for no idle purpose, as youshall hear. But there's one thing in my mind.""What's that?" he asked.</p> 
<p>　　"Why this," I answered. "That I shall ill requite the very great honoursRuritania has done me if I depart from it leaving one of those Six alive-neitherwith the help of God, will I."And Sapt shook my hand on that.</p>
