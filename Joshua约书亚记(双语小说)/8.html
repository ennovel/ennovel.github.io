<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the Lord said to Joshua, Have no fear and do not be troubled: take with you all the fighting-men and go up against Ai: for I have given into your hands the king of Ai and his people and his town and his land: 
<br>8:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 怎 样 待 耶 利 哥 和 耶 利 哥 的 王 ， 也 当 照 样 待 艾 城 和 艾 城 的 王 。 只 是 城 内 所 夺 的 财 物 和 牲 畜 ， 你 们 可 以 取 为 自 己 的 掠 物 。 你 要 在 城 后 设 下 伏 兵 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And you are to do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king: but their goods and their cattle you may take for yourselves: let a secret force be stationed to make a surprise attack on the town from the back. 
<br>8:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 ， 约 书 亚 和 一 切 兵 丁 都 起 来 ， 要 上 艾 城 去 。 约 书 亚 选 了 三 万 大 能 的 勇 士 ， 夜 间 打 发 他 们 前 往 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So Joshua and the fighting-men got ready to go up against Ai; and Joshua took thirty thousand men of war, and sent them out by night. 
<br>8:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 吩 咐 他 们 说 ， 你 们 要 在 城 后 埋 伏 ， 不 可 离 城 太 远 ， 都 要 各 自 准 备 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he gave them their orders, saying, Go and take up your position secretly at the back of the town: do not go very far away, and let all of you be ready: 
<br>8:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 与 我 所 带 领 的 众 民 要 向 城 前 往 。 城 里 的 人 像 初 次 出 来 攻 击 我 们 的 时 候 ， 我 们 就 在 他 们 面 前 逃 跑 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And I and all the people with me will come near the town, and when they come out against us as they did before, we will go in flight from them; 
<br>8:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 必 出 来 追 赶 我 们 ， 直 到 我 们 引 诱 他 们 离 开 城 。 因 为 他 们 必 说 ， 这 些 人 像 初 次 在 我 们 面 前 逃 跑 。 所 以 我 们 要 在 他 们 面 前 逃 跑 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And they will come out after us, till we have got them away from the town; for they will say, They have gone in flight from us as before; so we will go in flight before them; 
<br>8:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 们 就 从 埋 伏 的 地 方 起 来 ， 夺 取 那 城 。 因 为 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 ， 必 把 城 交 在 你 们 手 里 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then you will get up from your secret position and take the town, for the Lord your God will give it up into your hands. 
<br>8:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 们 夺 了 城 以 后 ， 就 放 火 烧 城 ， 要 照 耶 和 华 的 话 行 。 这 是 我 吩 咐 你 们 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when you have taken the town, put fire to it, as the Lord has said: see, I have given you your orders. 
<br>8:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 书 亚 打 发 他 们 前 往 ， 他 们 就 上 埋 伏 的 地 方 去 ， 住 在 伯 特 利 和 艾 城 的 中 间 ， 就 是 在 艾 城 的 西 边 。 这 夜 约 书 亚 却 在 民 中 住 宿 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So Joshua sent them out: and they took up a secret position between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua kept with the people that night. 
<br>8:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 书 亚 清 早 起 来 ， 点 齐 百 姓 ， 他 和 以 色 列 的 长 老 在 百 姓 前 面 上 艾 城 去 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And early in the morning Joshua got up, and put the people in order, and he and the chiefs of Israel went up before the people to Ai. 
<br>8:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 众 民 ， 就 是 他 所 带 领 的 兵 丁 ， 都 上 去 ， 向 前 直 往 ， 来 到 城 前 ， 在 艾 城 北 边 安 营 。 在 约 书 亚 和 艾 城 中 间 有 一 山 谷 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And all the fighting-men who were with him went up and came near the town, and took up a position on the north side of Ai facing the town, with a valley between him and the town. 
<br>8:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 挑 了 约 有 五 千 人 ， 使 他 们 埋 伏 在 伯 特 利 和 艾 城 的 中 间 ， 就 是 在 艾 城 的 西 边 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And taking about five thousand men, he put them in position for a surprise attack on the west side of Ai, between Beth-el and Ai. 
<br>8:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 安 置 了 百 姓 ， 就 是 城 北 的 全 军 和 城 西 的 伏 兵 。 这 夜 约 书 亚 进 入 山 谷 之 中 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So all the people were in their places, the army on the north side of the town and the secret force on the west; and that night Joshua went down into the valley. 
<br>8:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 艾 城 的 王 看 见 这 景 况 ， 就 和 全 城 的 人 ， 清 早 急 忙 起 来 ， 按 所 定 的 时 候 ， 出 到 亚 拉 巴 前 ， 要 与 以 色 列 人 交 战 。 王 却 不 知 道 在 城 后 有 伏 兵 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now when the king of Ai saw it, he got up quickly and went out to war against Israel, he and all his people, to the slope going down to the valley; but he had no idea that a secret force was waiting at the back of the town. 
<br>8:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 书 亚 和 以 色 列 众 人 在 他 们 面 前 装 败 ， 往 那 通 旷 野 的 路 逃 跑 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Joshua and all Israel, acting as if they were overcome before them, went in flight by way of the waste land. 
<br>8:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 城 内 的 众 民 都 被 招 聚 ， 追 赶 他 们 。 艾 城 人 追 赶 的 时 候 ， 就 被 引 诱 离 开 城 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And all the people in Ai came together to go after them; and they went after Joshua, moving away from the town. 
<br>8:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 艾 城 和 伯 特 利 城 没 有 一 人 不 出 来 追 赶 以 色 列 人 的 ， 撇 了 敞 开 的 城 门 ， 去 追 赶 以 色 列 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; There was not a man in Ai and Beth-el who did not go out after Israel; and the town was open and unwatched while they went after Israel. 
<br>8:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 和 华 吩 咐 约 书 亚 说 ， 你 向 艾 城 伸 出 手 里 的 短 枪 ， 因 为 我 要 将 城 交 在 你 手 里 。 约 书 亚 就 向 城 伸 出 手 里 的 短 枪 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the Lord said to Joshua, Let your spear be stretched out against Ai; for I will give it into your hands. So Joshua took up his spear, stretching it out in the direction of the town. 
<br>8:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 一 伸 手 ， 伏 兵 就 从 埋 伏 的 地 方 急 忙 起 来 ， 夺 了 城 ， 跑 进 城 去 ， 放 火 焚 烧 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the secret force came quickly from their place, and running forward when they saw his hand stretched out, went into the town and took it, and put fire to it straight away. 
<br>8:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 艾 城 的 人 回 头 一 看 ， 不 料 ， 城 中 烟 气 冲 天 ， 他 们 就 无 力 向 左 向 右 逃 跑 。 那 往 旷 野 逃 跑 的 百 姓 便 转 身 攻 击 追 赶 他 们 的 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the men of Ai, looking back, saw the smoke of the town going up to heaven, and were unable to go this way or that: and the people who had gone in flight to the waste land were turned back on those who were coming after them. 
<br>8:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 书 亚 和 以 色 列 众 人 见 伏 兵 已 经 夺 了 城 ， 城 中 烟 气 飞 腾 ， 就 转 身 回 去 ， 击 杀 艾 城 的 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the town had been taken by the surprise attack, and that the smoke of the town had gone up, turning round they overcame the men of Ai. 
<br>8:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 伏 兵 也 出 城 迎 击 艾 城 人 ， 艾 城 人 就 困 在 以 色 列 人 中 间 ， 前 后 都 是 以 色 列 人 。 于 是 以 色 列 人 击 杀 他 们 ， 没 有 留 下 一 个 ， 也 没 有 一 个 逃 脱 的 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the other force came out of the town against them, so that they were being attacked on this side and on that: and Israel overcame them and let not one of them get away with his life. 
<br>8:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 生 擒 了 艾 城 的 王 ， 将 他 解 到 约 书 亚 那 里 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But the king of Ai they made prisoner, and took him to Joshua. 
<br>8:24 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 色 列 人 在 田 间 和 旷 野 杀 尽 所 追 赶 一 切 艾 城 的 居 民 。 艾 城 人 倒 在 刀 下 ， 直 到 灭 尽 。 以 色 列 众 人 就 回 到 艾 城 ， 用 刀 杀 了 城 中 的 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then, after the destruction of all the people of Ai in the field and in the waste land where they went after them, and when all the people had been put to death without mercy, all Israel went back to Ai, and put to death all who were in it without mercy. 
<br>8:25 [hgb]&nbsp; 当 日 杀 毙 的 人 ， 连 男 带 女 共 有 一 万 二 千 ， 就 是 艾 城 所 有 的 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; On that day twelve thousand were put to death, men and women, all the people of Ai. 
<br>8:26 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 书 亚 没 有 收 回 手 里 所 伸 出 来 的 短 枪 ， 直 到 把 艾 城 的 一 切 居 民 尽 行 杀 灭 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For Joshua did not take back his hand with the outstretched spear till the destruction of the people of Ai was complete. 
<br>8:27 [hgb]&nbsp; 惟 独 城 中 的 牲 畜 和 财 物 ， 以 色 列 人 都 取 为 自 己 的 掠 物 ， 是 照 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 约 书 亚 的 话 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But the cattle and the goods from that town, Israel took for themselves, as the Lord had given orders to Joshua. 
<br>8:28 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 书 亚 将 艾 城 焚 烧 ， 使 城 永 为 高 堆 ， 荒 场 ， 直 到 今 日 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So Joshua gave Ai to the flames, and made it a waste mass of stones for ever, as it is to this day. 
<br>8:29 [hgb]&nbsp; 又 将 艾 城 王 挂 在 树 上 ， 直 到 晚 上 。 日 落 的 时 候 ， 约 书 亚 吩 咐 人 把 尸 首 从 树 上 取 下 来 ， 丢 在 城 门 口 ， 在 尸 首 上 堆 成 一 大 堆 石 头 ， 直 存 到 今 日 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he put the king of Ai to death, hanging him on a tree till evening: and when the sun went down, Joshua gave them orders to take his body down from the tree, and put it in the public place of the town, covering it with a great mass of stones, which is there to this day. 
<br>8:30 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 时 ， 约 书 亚 在 以 巴 路 山 上 为 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 筑 一 座 坛 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Joshua put up an altar to the Lord, the God of Israel, in Mount Ebal, 
<br>8:31 [hgb]&nbsp; 是 用 没 有 动 过 铁 器 的 整 石 头 筑 的 ， 照 着 耶 和 华 仆 人 摩 西 所 吩 咐 以 色 列 人 的 话 ， 正 如 摩 西 律 法 书 上 所 写 的 。 众 人 在 这 坛 上 给 耶 和 华 奉 献 燔 祭 和 平 安 祭 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; In the way ordered by Moses, the servant of the Lord, as it is recorded in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of uncut stones, untouched by any iron instrument: and on it they made burned offerings and peace-offerings to the Lord. 
<br>8:32 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 书 亚 在 那 里 ， 当 着 以 色 列 人 面 前 ， 将 摩 西 所 写 的 律 法 抄 写 在 石 头 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he made there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, writing it before the eyes of the children of Israel. 
<br>8:33 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 色 列 众 人 ， 无 论 是 本 地 人 ， 是 寄 居 的 ， 和 长 老 ， 官 长 ， 并 审 判 官 ， 都 站 在 约 柜 两 旁 ， 在 抬 耶 和 华 约 柜 的 祭 司 利 未 人 面 前 ， 一 半 对 着 基 利 心 山 ， 一 半 对 着 以 巴 路 山 ， 为 以 色 列 民 祝 福 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 仆 人 摩 西 先 前 所 吩 咐 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And all Israel, those who were Israelites by birth, as well as the men from other lands living with them, and their responsible men and their overseers and judges, took their places round the ark, in front of the priests, the Levites, whose work it was to take up the ark of the Lord's agreement; half of them were stationed in front of Mount Gerizim and half in front of Mount Ebal, in agreement with the orders for the blessing of the children of Israel which Moses, the servant of the Lord, had given. 
<br>8:34 [hgb]&nbsp; 随 后 ， 约 书 亚 将 律 法 上 祝 福 ， 咒 诅 的 话 ， 照 着 律 法 书 上 一 切 所 写 的 ， 都 宣 读 了 一 遍 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And after, he gave them all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, as it is all recorded in the book of the law; 
<br>8:35 [hgb]&nbsp; 摩 西 所 吩 咐 的 一 切 话 ， 约 书 亚 在 以 色 列 全 会 众 和 妇 女 ， 孩 子 ， 并 他 们 中 间 寄 居 的 外 人 面 前 ， 没 有 一 句 不 宣 读 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Reading to all the meeting of Israel, with the women and the children and the men from other lands who were living among them, every word of the orders which Moses had given.
