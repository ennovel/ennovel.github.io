He was now satisfied that Philip had actually gone to seek out the ‘cunning man,’ and gather hints for the next race.</p> 
<p>When that evening Feltram returned, and, later still, entered Sir Bale’s library, the master of Mardykes was gladder to see his face and more interested about his news than he would have cared to confess.</p> 
<p>Philip Feltram did not affect unconsciousness of that anxiety, but, with great directness, proceeded to satisfy it.</p> 
<p>“I was in Cloostedd Forest today, nearly all day — and found the old gentleman in a wax. He did not ask me to drink, nor show me any kindness. He was huffed because you would not take the trouble to cross the lake to speak to him yourself. He took the money you sent him and counted it over, and dropped it into his pocket; and he called you hard names enough and to spare; but I brought him round, and at last he did talk.”</p> 
<p>“And what did he say?”</p> 
<p>“He said that the estate of Mardykes would belong to a Feltram.”</p> 
<p>“He might have said something more likely,” said Sir Bale sourly. “Did he say anything more?”</p> 
<p>“Yes. He said the winner at Langton Lea would be Silver Bell.”</p> 
<p>“Any other name?”</p> 
<p>“No.”</p> 
<p>“Silver Bell? Well, that’s not so odd as the last. Silver Bell stands high in the list. He has a good many backers — long odds in his favour against most of the field. I should not mind backing Silver Bell.”</p> 
<p>The fact is, that he had no idea of backing any other horse from the moment he heard the soothsayer’s prediction. He made up his mind to no half measures this time. He would go in to win something handsome.</p> 
<p>He was in great force and full of confidence on the race-course. He had no fears for the result. He bet heavily. There was a good margin still untouched of the Mardykes estate; and Sir Bale was a good old name in the county. He found a ready market for his offers, and had soon staked — such is the growing frenzy of that excitement — about twenty thousand pounds on his favourite, and stood to win seven.</p> 
<p>He did not win, however. He lost his twenty thousand pounds.</p> 
<p>And now the Mardykes estate was in imminent danger. Sir Bale returned, having distributed I O Us and promissory notes in all directions about him — quite at his wit’s end.</p> 
<p>Feltram was standing — as on the occasion of his former happier return — on the steps of Mardykes Hall, in the evening sun, throwing eastward a long shadow that was lost in the lake. He received him, as before, with a laugh.</p> 
<p>Sir Bale was too much broken to resent this laugh as furiously as he might, had he been a degree less desperate.</p> 
<p>He looked at Feltram savagely, and dismounted.</p> 
<p>“Last time you would not trust him, and this time he would not trust you. He’s huffed, and played you false.”</p> 
<p>“It was not he. I should have backed that damned horse in any case,” said Sir Bale, grinding his teeth. “What a witch you have discovered! One thing is true, perhaps. If there was a Feltram rich enough, he might have the estate now; but there ain’t. They are all beggars. So much for your conjurer.”</p> 
<p>“He may make amends to you, if you make amends to him.”</p> 
<p>“He! Why, what can that wretched impostor do? Damn me, I’m past helping now.”</p> 
<p>“Don’t you talk so,” said Feltram. “Be civil. You must please the old gentleman. He’ll make it up. He’s placable when it suits him. Why not go to him his own way? I hear you are nearly ruined. You must go and make it up.”</p> 
<p>“Make it up! With whom? With a fellow who can’t make even a guess at what’s coming? Why should I trouble my head about him more?”</p> 
<p>“No man, young or old, likes to be frumped. Why did you cross his fancy? He won’t see you unless you go to him as he chooses.”</p> 
<p>“If he waits for that, he may wait till doomsday. I don’t choose to go on that water — and cross it I won’t,” said Sir Bale.</p> 
<p>But when his distracting reminders began to pour in upon him, and the idea of dismembering what remained of his property came home to him, his resolution faltered.</p> 
<p>“I say, Feltram, what difference can it possibly make to him if I choose to ride round to Cloostedd Forest instead of crossing the lake in a boat?”</p> 
<p>Feltram smiled darkly, and answered.</p> 
<p>“I can’t tell. Can you?”</p> 
<p>“Of course I can’t — I say I can’t; besides, what audacity of a fellow like that presuming to prescribe to me! Utterly ludicrous! And he can’t predict — do you really think or believe, Feltram, that he can?”</p> 
<p>“I know he can. I know he misled you on purpose. He likes to punish those who don’t respect his will; and there is a reason in it, often quite clear — not ill-natured. Now you see he compels you to seek him out, and when you do, I think he’ll help you through your trouble. He said he would.”</p> 
<p>“Then you have seen him since?”</p> 
<p>“Yesterday. He has put a pressure on you; but he means to help you.”</p> 
<p>“If he means to help me, let him remember I want a banker more than a seer. Let him give me a lift, as he did before. He must lend me money.”</p> 
<p>“He’ll not stick at that. When he takes up a man, he carries him through.”</p> 
<p>“The races of Byermere — I might retrieve at them. But they don’t come off for a month nearly; and what is a man like me to do in the meantime?”</p> 
<p>“Every man should know his own business best. I’m not like you,” said Feltram grimly.</p> 
<p>Now Sir Bale’s trouble increased, for some people were pressing. Something like panic supervened; for it happened that land was bringing just then a bad price, and more must be sold in consequence.</p> 
<p>“All I can tell them is, I am selling land. It can’t be done in an hour. I’m selling enough to pay them all twice over. Gentlemen used to be able to wait till a man sold his acres for payment. Damn them! do they want my body, that they can’t let me alone for five minutes?”</p> 
<p>The end of it was, that before a week Sir Bale told Feltram that he would go by boat, since that fellow insisted on it; and he did not very much care if he were drowned.</p> 
<p>It was a beautiful autumnal day. Everything was bright in that mellowed sun, and the deep blue of the lake was tremulous with golden ripples; and crag and peak and scattered wood, faint in the distance, came out with a filmy distinctness on the fells in that pleasant light.</p> 
<p>Sir Bale had been ill, and sent down the night before for Doctor Torvey. He was away with a patient. Now, in the morning, he had arrived inopportunely. He met Sir Bale as he issued from the house, and had a word with him in the court, for he would not turn back.</p> 
<p>“Well,” said the Doctor, after his brief inspection, “you ought to be in your bed; that’s all I can say. You are perfectly mad to think of knocking about like this. Your pulse is at a hundred and ten; and, if you go across the lake and walk about Cloostedd, you’ll be raving before you come back.”</p> 
<p>Sir Bale told him, apologetically, as if his life were more to his doctor than to himself, that he would take care not to fatigue himself, and that the air would do him good, and that in any case he could not avoid going; and so they parted.</p> 
<p>Sir Bale took his seat beside Feltram in the boat, the sail was spread, and, bending to the light breeze that blew from Golden Friars, she glided from the jetty under Mardykes Hall, and the eventful voyage had begun.</p>
