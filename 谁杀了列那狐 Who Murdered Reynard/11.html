"What is it you want to know?"</p> 
<p>"I want you to be kind enough to tell me all you can concerning M. Reynard's death."</p> 
<p>"I can soon do that. I know nothing. I went out shopping, and when I came back there was a dead man on the floor."</p> 
<p>"At what time was that?"</p> 
<p>"Oh, during the afternoon. It was a good while after lunch."</p> 
<p>"Can't you be more definite than that?"</p> 
<p>"Not unless I guess. When anyone sees a dead man the next thing she does isn't to look at the clock. Not unless it's in books."</p> 
<p>"You're not trying to be very helpful."</p> 
<p>"I'm not trying either way. I 'm trying to make you understand that if you want to find out who did it you're wasting time asking us."</p> 
<p>"Who was in the room when you entered?"</p> 
<p>"No one except His Excellency. He'd just come in."</p> 
<p>"What do you know about Mr. Kindell?"</p> 
<p>"He's my cousin."</p> 
<p>"Then you probably know the business that brought him over here at the same time as yourselves."</p> 
<p>"I might guess, and be wrong. It mayn't have been business at all. He's not the sort who'd go about killing strange men in other people's rooms, if you mean that."</p> 
<p>"I'm sorry to hear that you have so decided an opinion. Here is a homicide which appears to have been the act of either your father or this young man, and of which we should greatly prefer that His Excellency should be cleared. I hoped that you might be able to give us a pointer in the right direction."</p> 
<p>"Well, I can't. They're both silly ideas. I've told you my father had only just come into the room."</p> 
<p>"How do you know that?"</p> 
<p>"He told me himself. I could see how angry he was that the man was there."</p> 
<p>"Angry? Surely that is a curious reaction to the discovery of a murdered man? Perhaps his annoyance was that you should see what had occurred?"</p> 
<p>"Perhaps it was, more or less. My father is particular about his suite being private and quiet. It's what he's got a right to expect, being who he is. . . . And if he had found it necessary to shoot someone, I don't see how you should interfere. He's an American citizen. You might say he is America, having the office he has. . . . Extra-territorial you call it, don't you? Or something like that."</p> 
<p>M. Samuel permitted himself a slight smile. "The ambassadorial immunity to which you allude does not extend to a neutral country. His Excellency is not accredited to France. But we are anxious to do what we can to spare him from any annoyance if - as we are anxious to think - the crime was not his, or even if he could give us any plausible justification for what occurred, our Government might be disposed to receive it in a spirit of tolerance. Our trouble is that neither you nor His Excellency will help us at all."</p> 
<p>"But we know nothing about it. What can we say more?"</p> 
<p>"You could tell me more of Mr. Kindell than you do. Why did he come up to these rooms at about the time the murder occurred?"</p> 
<p>"To say good-bye to me, more likely than not. He was going back to England last night."</p> 
<p>"Well, he will be coming back now."</p> 
<p>"Then he can tell you himself whatever you want to know."</p> 
<p>"Yes. He may see that it will be wise to do that."</p> 
<p>M. Samuel's tone indicated that it would be better if others were of the same mind. With a sufficient minimum of courtesy he got up to go. He thought that after he had talked to Kindell he might persuade the girl to a greater frankness.</p> 
<p>He felt that she had already told him more than she was aware, and a theory which would explain much was already taking place in his practical and experienced mind.</p>
