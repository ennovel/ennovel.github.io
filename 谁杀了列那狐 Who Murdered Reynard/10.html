THURLOW, accredited Ambassador Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary from the United States to the Court of St. James, might or might not be a guilty, but he was certainly a most angry, man.</p> 
<p>The French have a reputation for being more excitable than the people of his own land, but in this instance the contrast was of a contrary kind. Mr. Thurlow's explosive indignation found itself unable to disturb the calm, or deflect the course, of an investigation which, while treating him with extreme courtesy was yet of a coldly probing implacability.</p> 
<p>M. Samuel's colleagues said that he had no imagination, and that self-confidence born of invincible stupidity, had established him in the high position he held - which would, indeed, have been too high to have permitted him to give his time to the details of this investigation, but for the national humiliations or international complications which might arise from any major blunder.</p> 
<p>M. Samuel would himself have accepted (with important qualifications) the character which his enemies attributed to him. He would have said that his success was due to the fact that he preferred the obvious and commonplace to the bizarre or recondite explanation of any problem with which he might have to deal. In the result, he had had few spectacular triumphs of which to boast, but his mistakes had been fewer still. So he had come to his present place.</p> 
<p>Now he sat opposite Mr. Thurlow, in the lounge of that gentleman's suite, sharing a pleasant fire, and having accepted one of the ambassador's excellent cigars.</p> 
<p>"Monsieur - Your Excellency - - " he said, "that you should be annoyed thus - our regret is extreme. But you will see how we stand. M. Reynard is dead. He was a police-officer of France and he has been murdered here. He did not die by his own hand, that is sure. We do not say it was done by you. We have no cause to suggest! But a motive there must have been. And it is between yourself and Mr. Kindell the deed must lie. You say you are sure it was not he; and beyond that you will tell us nothing at all. It is hard to think that you know as little as that!"</p> 
<p>"I tell you I never heard of the man till I saw his dead body lying in the room, on which I rang the hotel office at once. I did not know who he was, nor how he came to be there. Can I be plainer than that? It is for you to explain, and for the hotel management to apologize that they cannot keep my rooms clear of a sight which I was sorry for my daughter to see."</p> 
<p>M. Samuel, allowed himself to smile slightly at this view of the matter, but continued the conversation without being diverted from the patient persistent path which he had decided to take.</p> 
<p>"You should consider," he said, "that our Bureau can be discreet. It is with us that a confidence may be safely made. There may be questions of mistake, or of self-defence. Even that of justification might be proposed. Our Government would listen to representations made in the right way, coming from one in the position you hold, or from your Government on your behalf, Even though M. Reynard's position, and the character that he held - ! But you will say nothing at all, and the hours pass! That which may be done now may be impossible on another day."</p> 
<p>"I tell you I know nothing at all. Can I add to that?"</p> 
<p>"There is this young man you would shield?"</p> 
<p>"I would shield no one who shoots men in rooms I have taken at a price which should secure my privacy, unless I know a good reason why, which I certainly don't now."</p> 
<p>"Yet Mr. Kindell is a friend?"</p> 
<p>"He is slightly related to me."</p> 
<p>"If you would tell me why you came to Paris at all?"</p> 
<p>"My daughter approves your shops."</p> 
<p>M. Samuel shrugged his shoulders slightly. He gave an audible sigh. "And the young man who is slightly related? He would have come for the same cause?"</p> 
<p>"I know nothing of that. He did not come with us."</p> 
<p>"No. But he was here. I must regret that you will not help me at all. . . . I will see Miss Thurlow now, if you please."</p> 
<p>"She can tell you nothing. She was not here at the time."</p> 
<p>"That is to be seen."</p> 
<p>"Well, I will call her."</p> 
<p>"I should prefer to see her alone."</p> 
<p>Mr. Thurlow hesitated. Then, with an impatient gesture, he gave way, as he dearly must.</p> 
<p>"Very well. You are wasting time. But I waste my own if I tell you that. I will ask Miss Thurlow to see you here."</p> 
<p>But as he spoke Irene entered the room. She would have withdrawn when she saw M. Samuel, but her father said: "Irene, you had better answer any questions this gentleman asks. He thinks I have no more sense than to kill strangers who enter my apartment, with a knife that I haven't got."</p> 
<p>He walked out as he spoke, leaving M. Samuel to interrogate a girl who now looked at him with wary and hostile eyes.</p>
