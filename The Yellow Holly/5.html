She was a fluffy-haired kitten of a woman, more like a Dresden china shepherdess than a mere human being. Nothing could be prettier than her face and figure, and nothing more engaging than her manners. With her yellow hair, her charming face, and her melting blue eyes, she managed to hold her own against younger women. The late Mr. Ward, Lord Ransome's son, had been a fast young man, devoted to the turf and to his pretty wife. But he was killed when riding in a steeplechase two years after his marriage, and left his widow alone in the world with one daughter for consolation in her affliction. Mrs. Ward being in want of money--for her deceased father had been a general with nothing but his pay--played her cards so well with regard to her father-in-law, that he allowed her a good income and thought she was the most perfect of women. But Lord Ransome was the only one of the family who thought so, for the other relatives fought rather shy of the pretty, pleading widow.
<br> 
<br> Not that Mrs. Ward minded. She characterized the women as frumps and the men as fools, and, having enough to live on comfortably, set up a house in Curzon Street. It was thought that she would marry again; and probably she would have done so had a sufficiently rich husband with a title been forthcoming. But somehow no one worth capturing ever came Mrs. Ward's way, and as time went on she chose to assume the role of a devoted mother, and--as she phrased it--to live again in her daughter. This was quite wrong, as Dorothy Ward was a slim, serious-minded girl of nineteen, not given to gayety, and was one who was anxious to marry a husband with mind rather than with money. How frivolous little Mrs. Ward came to have such a Puritan daughter no one ever could make out. She resembled her mother neither in face, nor in manner, nor in tastes. Mrs. Ward openly lamented that Dorothy was such a difficult girl to manage, which meant that Dorothy had refused several good matches, and had declined to be guided entirely by her mother's opinion. When the Earl of Summerslea proposed and was not accepted, Mrs. Ward was furious, but Dorothy said steadily that she would never marry a brute with a title.
<br> 
<br> "You'll marry any one I choose," said Mrs. Ward when the two were discussing the matter.
<br> 
<br> "Certainly not Lord Summerslea," rejoined Dorothy, steadily.
<br> 
<br> "And certainly not that penniless George Brendon," retorted her mother. "You shall not throw yourself away on him."
<br> 
<br> "He is a good man and a clever man, and a man whom any woman might be proud of winning, mother."
<br> 
<br> "And a man with no money and no position. Who is he? What is his family? No one ever heard of him."
<br> 
<br> "They will one day, when he becomes famous."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, as a writing-person. As though any one cared two pins about that sort of thing. I want to see you a countess."
<br> 
<br> "You shall never see me the Countess of Summerslea. I know all about that man. He is bad and dissipated."
<br> 
<br> "O Lord! as if that mattered," cried Mrs. Ward with supreme contempt. "Your father was the same, yet we got on all right."
<br> 
<br> "I am sure you did," said Dorothy, with bitter meaning, upon which Mrs. Ward showed her claws. Her friends called her a kitten, but she was a cat in reality and could scratch on occasions. But all her scratching could not make Dorothy Lady Summerslea.
<br> 
<br> Hating Brendon, and knowing that her daughter liked him, it was supposed by Mrs. Ward's friends that the young man would be sent to the right-about, and that Dorothy would be kept out of his way. But Mrs. Ward knew her daughter too well to take such a disastrous course.
<br> 
<br> "My dear," she said to an intimate friend, "if I did that, Dorothy is just the kind of annoying girl to run away with him and live in a garret. If I let them meet they will not think of marriage, and I dare say Dorothy will get tired of Brendon. He is so shabby in his dress, and so poor, that after a time she will cease to like him. No! No! I'll let him follow her wherever he likes, and meet her on all occasions. They will grow sick of one another."
<br> 
<br> In an ordinary case this recipe might have answered. But Dorothy respected as well as loved George Brendon, and, every time she met him, grew to admire and love him more. Mrs. Ward became quite exasperated, and redoubled her efforts to sicken Dorothy of the "creature," as she called Brendon. She took to praising him on all occasions, and sometimes asked him to dinner. At the same time she constantly abused young Walter Vane, who was Lord Derrington's grandson and heir. He was the man she wished Dorothy to marry, as one day he would have a title and fifteen thousand a year. But in spite of this Machiavellian policy Dorothy still continued to love George, and expressed a hearty dislike for Walter Vane, whom she characterized as a "weakling."
<br> 
<br> "If he had only the grit of his grandfather I might respect him."
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Ward turned pale under her rouge when she heard this. "Oh, no, no! Lord Derrington is a terrible old man. Were Walter such as he is, I should not ask you to marry him."
<br> 
<br> "You would marry me to the Prince of Darkness himself if it suited your purpose," said her daughter, calmly, from which speech it will be seen that Miss Ward had small respect for her fascinating mother.
<br> 
<br> The two did not assimilate, as their dispositions were so different. Mrs. Ward complained that Dorothy was too religious, and Dorothy found the frivolous world in which her mother moved dull beyond words. It so happened that Dorothy stayed mostly at home or went out with one of her aunts, who was something of her type, while Mrs. Ward enjoyed herself at Hurlingham and Monte Carlo. The little woman always managed to keep on the right side, as she had no notion of losing her position in society, or the income which Lord Ransome allowed her; but within limits she was extremely fast. She generally had a number of young men at her heels, and made use of them in betting and in getting boxes for the theaters, for suppers at the Cecil, and gloves, when nothing else was to be had. But she managed all these things so discreetly that no one had a word to say, and the general impression was that she was a dear little woman with a stiff daughter--quite a trial. And if some old frumps did praise up Dorothy and condemn the mother, they were in the minority.
<br> 
<br> Things were in this position when the murder of Mrs. Jersey took place. Dorothy read about it in the papers, and knowing that George had gone to stop in the house with Train, was extremely anxious to hear particulars. She wrote to his Kensington address asking him to call, but received no reply. Then she saw that he gave evidence at the inquest, and two days later George made his appearance at the Curzon Street house. Mrs. Ward, who had been voluble in her expressions regarding Brendon's "love for low company," so she put it, sailed toward him with open hands. She always welcomed Brendon in this bright, girlish, kittenish way, as it was part of her scheme. She thought so serious a man would never relish a frivolous mother-in-law, and hoped to get rid of him in this way. But Brendon was too much in love with Dorothy to mind the vagaries of her fashionable parent.
<br> 
<br> "My dear Mr. Brendon," cried Mrs. Ward in her usual gushing manner, "I am so glad to see you. The murder, you know. I saw your name in the papers. How exciting! how romantic! Tell us all about it."
<br> 
<br> "There is nothing to tell, Mrs. Ward," said George, glancing round the room and seeing that Dorothy was absent. "All I know is set forth in the papers."
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Ward arranged herself on the sofa and laughed joyously. "Quite exciting it is," she said. "I wonder who killed the poor woman, and how did you come to be there on the very night she died?"
<br> 
<br> This last question was asked sharply, and with a keen glance. George was rather taken aback, but not thinking she had any intention in what she said, answered, soberly enough: "I went to see a friend, Mrs. Ward. It was unfortunate that I chose that night."
<br> 
<br> "Well, of course you didn't know," said Mrs. Ward, artlessly. "But fancy knowing any one living in an out-of-the-way place like that. But you do know such queer people."
<br> 
<br> George thought he knew none queerer than Mrs. Ward herself, but he suppressed this speech as impolite. "My friend is Mr. Leonard Train."
<br> 
<br> "Really! I think I have met him. His father made a fortune out of mustard, or coke, or something horrid. What was he doing there?"
<br> 
<br> "Looking for characters for a book."
<br> 
<br> "Oh!" Mrs. Ward opened her eyes. "Did he find any?"
<br> 
<br> "I believe so. But he has left the house now."
<br> 
<br> "I should think every one would leave it after the murder," said Mrs. Ward. "Dorothy will be down soon, but meantime tell me the whole thing from your own clever point of view."
<br> 
<br> She was so pertinacious that Brendon had reluctantly to yield. He detailed events as they had been reported by the press, but concerning the confidence of Leonard he kept silent. Mrs. Ward expressed her disappointment when he finished. "You tell me nothing new."
<br> 
<br> "I warned you that I would not," replied Brendon, wondering at her petulant speech.
<br> 
<br> "But surely you can throw some light on the matter?" said Mrs. Ward.
<br> 
<br> Brendon shook his head. "I fear not. I went to bed at eleven and slept soundly until I was awakened by the clamor."
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Ward thought for a moment. "Does Mr. Train know anything?"
<br> 
<br> "Nothing more than I have told you," declared Brendon, uncomfortably. He disliked deviating from the truth even in the smallest particular, but he dare not risk the story of his birth becoming public property. It was strange, he thought, that Mrs. Ward should take such a profound interest in this case. He had never before heard her talk on such a subject. To add to his perplexity, he saw that, in spite of her rouge, in spite of the shaded windows, she looked haggard. Yet it was impossible that she could be connected with the matter in any way. He ventured a leading question. "Why are you so anxious to know about this case?"
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Ward's reply rather astonished him. "I am not blind," she said quietly, "and I know well enough that you admire my daughter. You are poor, you are unknown, and should Dorothy marry you she would make a very bad match."
<br> 
<br> "I am aware of that," began George, "but----"
<br> 
<br> "Wait," cried Mrs. Ward, raising her hand, "I have not yet done. Notwithstanding all these disadvantages, I made up my mind to place no bar to your union with my daughter, as she seems to like you----"
<br> 
<br> "She loves me, Mrs. Ward."
<br> 
<br> "Nonsense. Dorothy is too young to know the meaning of the word. I say she likes you, so we can let it stand at that. But in spite of your poverty and obscurity--" Brendon winced, for Mrs. Ward's tone was insolent in the extreme--"I am not willing that you should marry Dorothy, unless----" She hesitated.
<br> 
<br> "Unless?" queried George, looking steadily at her. "Now we come to the point. Unless your character is above suspicion."
<br> 
<br> "What do you mean?"
<br> 
<br> "You know well enough. Here you go to a low house, and while you are there the mistress of it is murdered."
<br> 
<br> George rose with some indignation. "Good heavens, Mrs. Ward, you don't suspect me!" he cried.
<br> 
<br> "Oh, dear, no. But it would be unpleasant for my daughter to have a husband mixed up with such a shady affair."
<br> 
<br> "I am not mixed up with it, Mrs. Ward."
<br> 
<br> "It's unpleasant," said Mrs. Ward, willfully holding to her opinion. "I don't like it. Find out who killed that woman and I say nothing. But until you do find out, and until the assassin is brought to justice, I must ask you to discontinue your visits to Dorothy."
<br> 
<br> Brendon saw that she was simply making an excuse to rid herself of his presence so as to leave the way clear for Walter Vane. But he was too strong a man to be foiled in this way, and speedily made up his mind how to act. "Shall we leave the matter to Miss Ward?"
<br> 
<br> "That means you wish to see her," said the mother cleverly. "Oh, well, there is no reason why you should not. But it will be for the last time, remember. Your character must bear inspection."
<br> 
<br> "I think it does," cried George, rather nettled.
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Ward, who by this time was nearly at the door, turned lightly and replied, in her most kittenish way, "Ah, my dear Mr. Brendon, I know more than you think. Lola Velez----"
<br> 
<br> "Lola Velez." George looked and felt uneasy.
<br> 
<br> "You change color. Oh, I have heard all about you and that dancer."
<br> 
<br> "I assure you that my connection with that lady is perfectly innocent."
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Ward scoffed. "Lady!" she said, sneering. "What next? However, I do not wish to hear the particulars. Such creatures are nothing to me. And if you clear yourself of this very shady business in Amelia Square by discovering the true assassin, I shall overlook Lola Velez."
<br> 
<br> "There is no need to overlook her or me."
<br> 
<br> "I think there is," said Mrs. Ward, frigidly, and with a wave of her slim hand. "There is no more to be said, Mr. Brendon. You know my decision, and as Dorothy's mother I have some power, I hope. Now I will send her to you, and you can say what you like--in fact, you can communicate to her the state of my feelings. But," added Mrs. Ward, shooting a Parthian arrow, "I should not mention Lola Velez if I were you. Good-by, I shall not see you for many a long day, I expect."
<br> 
<br> "And hope," said Brendon, much mortified.
<br> 
<br> "And hope," replied Mrs. Ward, coolly. "You are the last man in the world I should like for my son-in-law. Marry that dancer," and with a shrill, unpleasant laugh Mrs. Ward vanished.
<br> 
<br> Brendon paced the room, waiting for Dorothy. How Mrs. Ward had learned of his connection with Lola Velez he could not understand. Brendon was perfectly innocent, and what he had done for the dancer was dictated by pure kindness. But even if he explained the whole circumstances of his meeting and of his philanthropy to Dorothy, she was a woman, when all was said and done, and might not believe him. On the whole, he decided to take Mrs. Ward's advice and hold his tongue on the subject of the dancer. On some future occasion he might be able to explain, and at the present moment he had the satisfaction of knowing that his conscience was clear. He had just arrived at this decision when Dorothy entered the room. The next moment she was in his arms, and the two entered Paradise at once.
<br> 
<br> "My dearest, I am so glad to see you," said Dorothy in her soft voice as they sat down. "I wrote, but you did not come."
<br> 
<br> "I was engaged, darling."
<br> 
<br> Dorothy nodded. "I know, at the inquest which was held on that poor creature."
<br> 
<br> "Why do you take an interest in the case, Dorothy?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, because you went to stop at the house, and it was so strange that she should have died on that very night."
<br> 
<br> "So your mother says," said George, uncomfortably. "I really think she believes that I have something to do with the matter."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, that's nonsense," said Dorothy, serenely; "but mother does not like you very much, George, and----"
<br> 
<br> "She hates me you mean."
<br> 
<br> "Well," responded Miss Ward, candidly, "if you ask me to tell the truth, I think she does. But you know what my mother is. I--no, if I cannot say good of her, let me at least say nothing bad. But I love you, George, you know that."
<br> 
<br> "My own heart," and Brendon took her in his strong arms, thanking God for the gift of so steadfast a heart. For a few minutes silence reigned, and the lovers looked at one another with fond affection.
<br> 
<br> Dorothy was tall and slim and dark, with a Spanish face of that delicate, high-bred cast which is seen to perfection among the women of Andalusia. Judging by her large black eyes, and the serious expression of her lips, Dorothy Ward might have had Moorish blood in her veins. Perhaps she had, as one of her father's ancestors, when ambassador to Madrid in the reign of the first James, had brought back with him a Spanish wife. And Dorothy inherited all the Iberian beauty of that lady. She should have been called Inez, or Paquita, for the purely English name of Dorothy suited her badly. That is a milkmaid's name, and Miss Ward was more of the court than of the pasture.
<br> 
<br> Her dark beauty contrasted well with the fair comeliness of George Brendon, and seated side by side on the sofa they looked an extremely handsome couple. Certainly they might have appeared happier, for Dorothy was downcast, and in Brendon's blue eyes there lurked a worried look. He was wondering how he could communicate Mrs. Ward's decision to the girl. Dorothy looked at him and smiled.
<br> 
<br> "A penny for your thoughts, George," she said, taking his hand.
<br> 
<br> "I'll sell them as bankrupt stock," said Brendon, drawing her closer, and then he took his courage in both hands for the necessary confession. "This may be my last visit, Dorothy," he said.
<br> 
<br> She looked at him in surprise. "Why do you say that?"
<br> 
<br> "Your mother----"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, never mind my mother," broke in the girl, petulantly. "I know she objects to our marriage, so----"
<br> 
<br> "On the contrary, she told me that she would not object if I could clear myself of complicity in this crime."
<br> 
<br> "George! Did she accuse you of----"
<br> 
<br> "Not in so many words," interrupted the lover, "but I saw very plainly what she meant. The fact that I slept in that house on the night Mrs. Jersey was murdered is to her mind a proof that I have something to do with the matter."
<br> 
<br> "But you can prove conclusively that you have not," insisted Dorothy.
<br> 
<br> "Certainly. Mr. Train, with whom I was stopping, can prove that I did not leave my room. The key of the sitting-room door was in his possession, and to get out I should have had to make use of him." George paused and thought for a moment. "But there is one thing----"
<br> 
<br> "What is it?" asked Dorothy, seeing that he hesitated.
<br> 
<br> "I don't know if I ought to tell you."
<br> 
<br> "Whatever concerns you concerns me," she said, pressing his hand to her heart. "You know that I love you as dearly as you love me, and nothing you tell me shall ever part us."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, I don't think what I am about to say will have that effect," was Brendon's reply, "but I have a confession to make about my--my birth."
<br> 
<br> Dorothy looked at him in amazement. "About your birth?" she repeated.
<br> 
<br> "Yes. You may as well know all, and I know you will not betray me, even to your mother."
<br> 
<br> "To her least of all," said Dorothy, vehemently. "Tell me quick."
<br> 
<br> Encouraged by her faith, and by the tender clasp of her hand, George related to her the story of his birth and of his connection with Lord Derrington. Also he detailed how he had gone to seek Mrs. Jersey, and how she had been murdered before he could get the truth out of her. "Or even see her," finished George. "And now you know, dearest, why I do not wish you to repeat this story. If your mother knew it she might think--think--well, she certainly would not let you marry me."
<br> 
<br> "She has made her mind up already so far as that is concerned," said Dorothy, quickly. "It is Mr. Vane whom she wishes me to marry."
<br> 
<br> "My cousin, although he does not know it," said George, quietly; "but I want your advice, Dorothy, and will be guided by it. What shall I do? You see, now that Mrs. Jersey is dead there is no chance of getting at the truth."
<br> 
<br> "Why not advertise?"
<br> 
<br> "I have tried that for some months in every country paper in the kingdom, but there has been no response. My father and mother must have been married in some out-of-the-way village, in some lonely church. The parson and those who know about the marriage may be dead. In fact, it is extremely probable that they are. Mrs. Jersey was present as my mother's maid, and she might have been able to tell me where the church is. I only want to find the register of the marriage and get the certificate. Then I shall see Lord Derrington and insist on my rights being recognized. He can't leave either the title or the money away from me."
<br> 
<br> "Have you seen him at all yet?"
<br> 
<br> "Not to speak to. But he was pointed out to me. I hear he is an old tyrant."
<br> 
<br> Dorothy shuddered. "A most terrible old man. He always reminds me of one of those Italian despots. There is nothing he would not do provided that the law could not touch him."
<br> 
<br> "And I dare say, from your description, the things he desires to do are of the kind that the law would make him answerable for."
<br> 
<br> "George," said Dorothy, after a pause, "do you think he has anything to do with this murder?"
<br> 
<br> Brendon turned slightly pale and set his lips firmly. "No, dearest," was his reply, but delivered with some uncertainty. "He does not know--at all events from me--that I am seeking for a restitution of my rights, and therefore would have no reason to rid himself of this woman. Besides, I don't know if he is aware of her existence."
<br> 
<br> It will be seen that Brendon was ignorant that Lord Derrington was the owner of the Jersey mansion and had allowed Madame an annuity. Had he known this much he might have been able to shape his course better; but, being in the dark, he had to do the best he could with Dorothy's assistance. He had asked for her advice and she gave it.
<br> 
<br> "George, I should get back my birthright if I were you."
<br> 
<br> "But I may be dragged into this murder case."
<br> 
<br> "No. Mr. Train can save you from being accused of that. It is only right that you should take your proper position in society. You know I would marry you as you are, and defy my mother and the world. But you owe it to your dead mother and to yourself to show that you have the right to your father's name."
<br> 
<br> "In that case I shall do what you advise," cried George, taking heart from her firm tone; "and the first thing I shall do will be to see Mr. Ireland.
<br> 
<br> "Who is he, George?"
<br> 
<br> "My guardian. He took charge of me after my grandfather Lockwood died, and it was by his advice that I changed my name to baffle the inquiries of Lord Derrington. He will know all about the marriage, and may be able to indicate where my parents went when they eloped. I have never asked him for a detailed statement, but I shall do so now. Once I find a clew, I shall not rest until I prove my legitimacy. For your sake, my dear--for your sake," and he kissed her.
<br> 
<br> "And for your own," said Dorothy, as they rose. "I shall say nothing to my mother or to any one, George. But tell me all that you do."
<br> 
<br> "I shall make a regular report," replied Brendon, "but we will probably have to meet elsewhere, as your mother has asked me to discontinue my visits here."
<br> 
<br> "I shall speak to her," said Dorothy, angrily.
<br> 
<br> "No. Do not do that. She will only grow angry and make things harder for you, my own heart. Good-by, and God bless you."
<br> 
<br> They kissed and parted at the door. Brendon was just stepping out into the hall when a thought occurred to him. He re-entered and closed the door. "Dorothy," he asked, in a low whisper, "why did you give me the yellow holly on that night?"
<br> 
<br> She looked surprised. "It was to please you," she said softly; "and to tell you the truth, George, I thought that the holly was a proof that my mother was relenting toward you."
<br> 
<br> "How do you mean, Dorothy?"
<br> 
<br> "It was my mother who gave me the holly," she explained. "I came from the Park and told her you were going to stop with Mr. Train, and that she could set her mind at rest, as I should not see you for a few days. She seemed pleased, and taking the yellow holly from a vase in her boudoir she gave me a sprig, saying that I could give it to you for consolation."
<br> 
<br> "Did you tell her that you had fastened it in my coat?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes. But she only laughed, and said it would please you. Why do you ask me this, George?"
<br> 
<br> "There is no reason for my asking," he replied, suppressing the truth, "but yellow holly is rare."
<br> 
<br> "Very rare. I don't know where my mother got the sprig."
<br> 
<br> After this they parted, and Brendon walked thoughtfully away. Mrs. Jersey had been startled by the sight of the holly. Mrs. Ward had given the sprig to Dorothy, who had presented it to him. He asked himself if there was a reason for Mrs. Ward's action.
