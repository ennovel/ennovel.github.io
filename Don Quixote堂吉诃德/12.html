Round the skins six of the men belonging to the fold seated themselves, having first with rough politeness pressed Don Quixote to take a seat upon a trough which they placed for him upside down. Don Quixote seated himself, and Sancho remained standing to serve the cup, which was made of horn. Seeing him standing, his master said to him:</p> 
<p>“That thou mayest see, Sancho, the good that knight-errantry contains in itself, and how those who fill any office in it are on the high road to be speedily honoured and esteemed by the world, I desire that thou seat thyself here at my side and in the company of these worthy people, and that thou be one with me who am thy master and natural lord, and that thou eat from my plate and drink from whatever I drink from; for the same may be said of knight-errantry as of love, that it levels all.”</p> 
<p>“Great thanks,” said Sancho, “but I may tell your worship that provided I have enough to eat, I can eat it as well, or better, standing, and by myself, than seated alongside of an emperor. And indeed, if the truth is to be told, what I eat in my corner without form or fuss has much more relish for me, even though it be bread and onions, than the turkeys of those other tables where I am forced to chew slowly, drink little, wipe my mouth every minute, and cannot sneeze or cough if I want or do other things that are the privileges of liberty and solitude. So, senor, as for these honours which your worship would put upon me as a servant and follower of knight-errantry, exchange them for other things which may be of more use and advantage to me; for these, though I fully acknowledge them as received, I renounce from this moment to the end of the world.”</p> 
<p>“For all that,” said Don Quixote, “thou must seat thyself, because him who humbleth himself God exalteth;” and seizing him by the arm he forced him to sit down beside himself.</p> 
<p>The goatherds did not understand this jargon about squires and knights-errant, and all they did was to eat in silence and stare at their guests, who with great elegance and appetite were stowing away pieces as big as one’s fist. The course of meat finished, they spread upon the sheepskins a great heap of parched acorns, and with them they put down a half cheese harder than if it had been made of mortar. All this while the horn was not idle, for it went round so constantly, now full, now empty, like the bucket of a water-wheel, that it soon drained one of the two wine-skins that were in sight. When Don Quixote had quite appeased his appetite he took up a handful of the acorns, and contemplating them attentively delivered himself somewhat in this fashion:</p> 
<p>“Happy the age, happy the time, to which the ancients gave the name of golden, not because in that fortunate age the gold so coveted in this our iron one was gained without toil, but because they that lived in it knew not the two words “mine” and “thine”! In that blessed age all things were in common; to win the daily food no labour was required of any save to stretch forth his hand and gather it from the sturdy oaks that stood generously inviting him with their sweet ripe fruit. The clear streams and running brooks yielded their savoury limpid waters in noble abundance. The busy and sagacious bees fixed their republic in the clefts of the rocks and hollows of the trees, offering without usance the plenteous produce of their fragrant toil to every hand. The mighty cork trees, unenforced save of their own courtesy, shed the broad light bark that served at first to roof the houses supported by rude stakes, a protection against the inclemency of heaven alone. Then all was peace, all friendship, all concord; as yet the dull share of the crooked plough had not dared to rend and pierce the tender bowels of our first mother that without compulsion yielded from every portion of her broad fertile bosom all that could satisfy, sustain, and delight the children that then possessed her. Then was it that the innocent and fair young shepherdess roamed from vale to vale and hill to hill, with flowing locks, and no more garments than were needful modestly to cover what modesty seeks and ever sought to hide. Nor were their ornaments like those in use to-day, set off by Tyrian purple, and silk tortured in endless fashions, but the wreathed leaves of the green dock and ivy, wherewith they went as bravely and becomingly decked as our Court dames with all the rare and far-fetched artifices that idle curiosity has taught them. Then the love-thoughts of the heart clothed themselves simply and naturally as the heart conceived them, nor sought to commend themselves by forced and rambling verbiage. Fraud, deceit, or malice had then not yet mingled with truth and sincerity. Justice held her ground, undisturbed and unassailed by the efforts of favour and of interest, that now so much impair, pervert, and beset her. Arbitrary law had not yet established itself in the mind of the judge, for then there was no cause to judge and no one to be judged. Maidens and modesty, as I have said, wandered at will alone and unattended, without fear of insult from lawlessness or libertine assault, and if they were undone it was of their own will and pleasure. But now in this hateful age of ours not one is safe, not though some new labyrinth like that of Crete conceal and surround her; even there the pestilence of gallantry will make its way to them through chinks or on the air by the zeal of its accursed importunity, and, despite of all seclusion, lead them to ruin. In defence of these, as time advanced and wickedness increased, the order of knights-errant was instituted, to defend maidens, to protect widows and to succour the orphans and the needy. To this order I belong, brother goatherds, to whom I return thanks for the hospitality and kindly welcome ye offer me and my squire; for though by natural law all living are bound to show favour to knights-errant, yet, seeing that without knowing this obligation ye have welcomed and feasted me, it is right that with all the good-will in my power I should thank you for yours.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>All this long harangue (which might very well have been spared) our knight delivered because the acorns they gave him reminded him of the golden age; and the whim seized him to address all this unnecessary argument to the goatherds, who listened to him gaping in amazement without saying a word in reply. Sancho likewise held his peace and ate acorns, and paid repeated visits to the second wine-skin, which they had hung up on a cork tree to keep the wine cool.</p> 
<p>Don Quixote was longer in talking than the supper in finishing, at the end of which one of the goatherds said, “That your worship, senor knight-errant, may say with more truth that we show you hospitality with ready good-will, we will give you amusement and pleasure by making one of our comrades sing: he will be here before long, and he is a very intelligent youth and deep in love, and what is more he can read and write and play on the rebeck to perfection.”</p> 
<p>The goatherd had hardly done speaking, when the notes of the rebeck reached their ears; and shortly after, the player came up, a very good-looking young man of about two-and-twenty. His comrades asked him if he had supped, and on his replying that he had, he who had already made the offer said to him:</p> 
<p>“In that case, Antonio, thou mayest as well do us the pleasure of singing a little, that the gentleman, our guest, may see that even in the mountains and woods there are musicians: we have told him of thy accomplishments, and we want thee to show them and prove that we say true; so, as thou livest, pray sit down and sing that ballad about thy love that thy uncle the prebendary made thee, and that was so much liked in the town.”</p> 
<p>“With all my heart,” said the young man, and without waiting for more pressing he seated himself on the trunk of a felled oak, and tuning his rebeck, presently began to sing to these words.</p>  
<p>Well I know it, even though</p> 
<p>Love’s mute tongues, thine eyes, have never</p> 
<p>By their glances told me so.</p> 
<p>For I know my love thou knowest,</p> 
<p>Therefore thine to claim I dare:</p> 
<p>Once it ceases to be secret,</p> 
<p>Love need never feel despair.</p> 
<p>True it is, Olalla, sometimes</p> 
<p>Thou hast all too plainly shown</p> 
<p>That thy heart is brass in hardness,</p> 
<p>And thy snowy bosom stone.</p> 
<p>Yet for all that, in thy coyness,</p> 
<p>And thy fickle fits between,</p> 
<p>Hope is there — at least the border</p> 
<p>Of her garment may be seen.</p> 
<p>Lures to faith are they, those glimpses,</p> 
<p>And to faith in thee I hold;</p> 
<p>Kindness cannot make it stronger,</p> 
<p>Coldness cannot make it cold.</p> 
<p>If it be that love is gentle,</p> 
<p>In thy gentleness I see</p> 
<p>Something holding out assurance</p> 
<p>To the hope of winning thee.</p> 
<p>If it be that in devotion</p> 
<p>Lies a power hearts to move,</p> 
<p>That which every day I show thee,</p> 
<p>Helpful to my suit should prove.</p> 
<p>Many a time thou must have noticed —</p> 
<p>If to notice thou dost care —</p> 
<p>How I go about on Monday</p> 
<p>Dressed in all my Sunday wear.</p> 
<p>Love’s eyes love to look on brightness;</p> 
<p>Love loves what is gaily drest;</p> 
<p>Sunday, Monday, all I care is</p> 
<p>Thou shouldst see me in my best.</p> 
<p>No account I make of dances,</p> 
<p>Or of strains that pleased thee so,</p> 
<p>Keeping thee awake from midnight</p> 
<p>Till the cocks began to crow;</p> 
<p>Or of how I roundly swore it</p> 
<p>That there’s none so fair as thou;</p> 
<p>True it is, but as I said it,</p> 
<p>By the girls I’m hated now.</p> 
<p>For Teresa of the hillside</p> 
<p>At my praise of thee was sore;</p> 
<p>Said, “You think you love an angel;</p> 
<p>It’s a monkey you adore;</p> 
<p>“Caught by all her glittering trinkets,</p> 
<p>And her borrowed braids of hair,</p> 
<p>And a host of made-up beauties</p> 
<p>That would Love himself ensnare.”</p> 
<p>‘T was a lie, and so I told her,</p> 
<p>And her cousin at the word</p> 
<p>Gave me his defiance for it;</p> 
<p>And what followed thou hast heard.</p> 
<p>Mine is no high-flown affection,</p> 
<p>Mine no passion par amours —</p> 
<p>As they call it — what I offer</p> 
<p>Is an honest love, and pure.</p> 
<p>Cunning cords the holy Church has,</p> 
<p>Cords of softest silk they be;</p> 
<p>Put thy neck beneath the yoke, dear;</p> 
<p>Mine will follow, thou wilt see.</p> 
<p>Else — and once for all I swear it</p> 
<p>By the saint of most renown —</p> 
<p>If I ever quit the mountains,</p> 
<p>‘T will be in a friar’s gown.</p> 
<p>Here the goatherd brought his song to an end, and though Don Quixote entreated him to sing more, Sancho had no mind that way, being more inclined for sleep than for listening to songs; so said he to his master, “Your worship will do well to settle at once where you mean to pass the night, for the labour these good men are at all day does not allow them to spend the night in singing.”</p> 
<p>“I understand thee, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote; “I perceive clearly that those visits to the wine-skin demand compensation in sleep rather than in music.”</p> 
<p>“It’s sweet to us all, blessed be God,” said Sancho.</p> 
<p>“I do not deny it,” replied Don Quixote; “but settle thyself where thou wilt; those of my calling are more becomingly employed in watching than in sleeping; still it would be as well if thou wert to dress this ear for me again, for it is giving me more pain than it need.”</p> 
<p>Sancho did as he bade him, but one of the goatherds, seeing the wound, told him not to be uneasy, as he would apply a remedy with which it would be soon healed; and gathering some leaves of rosemary, of which there was a great quantity there, he chewed them and mixed them with a little salt, and applying them to the ear he secured them firmly with a bandage, assuring him that no other treatment would be required, and so it proved.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德受到几个牧羊人的热情接待。桑乔将就着安顿好罗西南多和他的驴，闻到锅里炖羊肉散发出的香味就折了回来。他想看看羊肉熟了没有，巴不得马上就端下锅来吃肉。这时，牧羊人把锅从火上端了下来，在地上铺了几张羊皮，迅速摆上一张旧桌子，非常客气地请两人共同进餐。茅屋里的六个牧羊人围坐在羊皮四周。他们首先以粗俗的礼仪请唐吉诃德坐在一个倒置的木桶上。唐吉诃德坐下后，桑乔站在旁边用角杯斟酒。唐吉诃德看到桑乔站着，就对他说：</p> 
<p>“桑乔，为了让你看到游侠骑士的殊荣，看到任何人只要与骑士稍有联系，马上就会得到世人的赞扬和尊重，我要你坐在我身边，陪伴我这位好人，与我同餐共饮，不分你我，尽管我是你的主人，也是你的大人。所谓游侠骑士，可以用一句谈论爱情的话来说，就是‘万事皆同’。”</p> 
<p>“不胜荣幸！”桑乔说，“不过我可以告诉您，只要有得吃，我自己一人站着吃和陪着皇帝吃一样好，甚至比陪着皇帝吃更好。而且说实话，您应该知道，我自己在角落里可以不必装模作样，拘于礼仪，即使吃面包葱头，也比在餐桌上吃吐绶鸡强，在餐桌上我得强装斯文，细嚼慢咽，还得不时揩嘴，想打喷嚏、咳嗽或做其他事都不行。因此，我的大人，您想把游侠骑士亲随的荣誉授予我，可我是您的侍从，已经是您的亲随了，所以我请您把这荣誉换成其他更实用的东西。这些荣誉，即使我领情接受下来，也永远用不上啊。”</p> 
<p>“尽管如此，你还是得坐下，‘卑微之人，上帝举荐’。”</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德拉着桑乔的胳膊，让他坐在自己身旁。几位牧羊人对侍从和游侠骑士之间的调侃不知所云，只是边吃边默默地注视着客人彬彬有礼而又津津有味地把拳头大小的羊肉块吞进肚里。羊肉吃完后，主人又在羊皮上摆了很多褐色橡子和半块奶酪，那奶酪硬得像泥灰块。斟酒频频，觥筹交错（角杯忽满忽空，就像水车上的戽斗），很快就把面前摆着的两只酒囊喝空了一个。唐吉诃德饭饱酒足，抓起一把橡子，端详一番，开始高谈阔论：</p> 
<p>“古人云，幸福的世纪和年代为黄金年代，这并不是因为在我们这个铁器时代非常珍贵的黄金到那个时候便唾手可得。人们称之为黄金年代，是因为生活在那个时代的人没有你我之概念。在那个神圣的年代，一切皆共有。任何人要得到基本食物，只需举手之劳，便可以从茂盛的圣栎树上得到香甜的果实。源源不断的清泉与河流提供了甘美澄澈的饮水。勤劳机智的蜜蜂在石缝树洞里建立了它们的国家，把丰收的甜蜜果实无私地奉献给大家。茁壮的栓皮槠树落落大方地褪去它宽展轻巧的树皮，在朴质的木桩上盖成了房屋，为人们抵御酷暑严寒。</p> 
<p>“那时候，人们安身立命，情同手足，和睦融洽，笨重的弯头犁还没敢打开我们仁慈的大地母亲的脏腑，而她却心甘情愿地用富庶辽阔的胸膛所拥有的一切来喂养和愉悦那些拥有她的儿女们。真的，那时候，纯真的靓女松散着头发，越山谷，过山丘，除了把该遮羞的部位遮住之外，并没有什么其他服饰。那点遮饰同现在的服饰不一样。现在多用蒂罗紫和五彩纷呈的丝绸，而那个时候只是将牛蒡的几片绿叶和常春藤编在一起而已，但却同现在的嫔妃们穿着新颖艳丽的服装一样显得庄重奢华。那时表达爱情的方式也很简朴，只是直抒心怀，从不绞尽脑汁去胡吹乱捧。欺诈和邪恶还未同真实和正义混杂在一起。正义自有它的天地，任何私欲贪心都不敢干扰冒犯它。而现在，这些东西竟敢蔑视、干扰和诋毁正义。那时候在法官的意识里，还没有枉法断案的观念，因为没有什么事什么人需要被宣判。我刚才说过，童女们可以只身到处行走，无需害怕恶棍歹徒伤害她们。如果她们失身，那也是心甘情愿的。</p> 
<p>“而现在呢，在我们这可恶的时代里，就是再建一座克里特迷宫①，也不会让任何一个女孩子感到安全。可恶的欲火使情爱的瘟疫通过缝隙和空气渗透进去，任何幽居处所对她们都无济于事。时间流逝，邪恶渐增。游侠骑士的出现可以使少女得到保护，使寡妇受到帮助，孤儿和穷人也能得到救济。</p> 
<p>“牧羊兄弟们，我就是这类游侠骑士。对于你们给予我和我的侍从的热情款待，我表示感谢。人人都理所当然地有义务帮助游侠骑士，可我知道你们并不了解这种义务，却能如此款待我，因此我才对你们诚挚地表示感谢。”</p> 
<p>①希腊神话中传说的四座迷宫之一，是代达洛斯为囚禁怪物弥诺陶罗斯所建。</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德的这番议论完全可以谅解，因为牧羊人的橡子使他想起了黄金时代，他忽然心血来潮，便对牧羊人慷慨陈辞。牧羊人一言不发，怔怔地听着。桑乔则默默地吃着橡子，还不时到第二个酒囊那儿去一下。那个酒囊挂在一棵栓皮槠树上，这样酒可以更凉些。</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德说话的时间比吃饭用的时间还多。晚饭结束后，一个牧羊人说：</p> 
<p>“游侠骑士大人，为了进一步证实您所说的我们招待您的真情，我们想请我们的一个伙伴唱唱歌，让您放松一下，高兴高兴。我们这个伙伴一会儿就来。他是个十分聪明而又多情的小伙子，并且能认字写字。他是三弦牧琴演奏手，演奏得妙极了。”</p> 
<p>牧羊人刚说到这儿，耳边就传来了三弦牧琴的乐曲声。那个小伙子也随之出现。他最多二十二岁，面目清秀。牧羊人们问他是否吃了饭，他说吃过了。刚才推荐他的那个人对他说：</p> 
<p>“安东尼奥，你赏脸唱一点儿，就可以为我们带来欢乐，也让我们这位贵客看看，在这深山老林里也有懂音乐的人。我们已经对他介绍了你的才干，希望你露一手，证明我们说的是真话。你请坐，唱唱你那教士叔叔为你作的爱情歌谣吧，这歌谣在村镇上挺受欢迎的。”</p> 
<p>“不胜荣幸。”小伙子说。</p> 
<p>小伙子没有再推辞，坐在一截圣栎树干上，弹着三弦牧琴，很动情地唱起来：</p> 
<p>安东尼奥之歌</p> 
<p>纵使你嘴上不说，</p> 
<p>娇眸顾盼情默默。</p> 
<p>我心明白，奥拉利亚，</p> 
<p>你在倾慕我。</p> 
<p>我知你痴心相印，</p> 
<p>笃信你钟情于我。</p> 
<p>仰慕春思尽表露，</p> 
<p>幸福美满无失落。</p> 
<p>奥拉利亚，你确曾若明若暗表露过，</p> 
<p>你心宛如青铜坚，</p> 
<p>白皙胸脯似石砣。</p> 
<p>你曾对我多呵叱，</p> 
<p>孤高自赏显冷漠。</p> 
<p>希望容或此中生，</p> 
<p>石榴裙展舞婆娑。</p> 
<p>义无反顾，</p> 
<p>信念执著，</p> 
<p>一厢情思不沮丧，</p> 
<p>倘得青睐亦自若。</p> 
<p>爱情若需常趋附，</p> 
<p>殷殷关切总投合。</p> 
<p>我曾时时暗传情，</p> 
<p>意乱情迷似入魔。</p> 
<p>你若有心人，</p> 
<p>秀眼会见我，</p> 
<p>周日披盛装，</p> 
<p>周一仍穿着。</p> 
<p>爱情与盛装，</p> 
<p>交相辉映同衬托。</p> 
<p>我愿你眼中，</p> 
<p>风骚我独获。</p> 
<p>可为你起舞，</p> 
<p>可为你唱和，</p> 
<p>夜半余音绕，</p> 
<p>报晓鸡同歌。</p> 
<p>盛赞无需有，</p> 
<p>我叹你天姿国色。</p> 
<p>句句意真切，</p> 
<p>引来恶语饶长舌。</p> 
<p>我把你颂扬，</p> 
<p>贝罗卡尔的特雷莎却说：</p> 
<p>“你以为钟情于天使，</p> 
<p>其实是中了邪魔。</p> 
<p>你赞赏不止孰不知，</p> 
<p>伊人青丝系假发，</p> 
<p>伊人娇媚是矫饰，</p> 
<p>骗取爱情心险恶。”</p> 
<p>我斥特雷莎，</p> 
<p>她嗔怒唤兄来挑衅。</p> 
<p>他之于我我于他，</p> 
<p>你尽可揣测。</p> 
<p>我爱你不沉湎，</p> 
<p>追求你不曲合。</p> 
<p>愿望诚高尚，</p> 
<p>为享天伦乐。</p> 
<p>教堂可结缡，</p> 
<p>连理夫妻相伴。</p> 
<p>向前莫犹豫，</p> 
<p>我甘结丝萝。</p> 
<p>你若弃我情，</p> 
<p>我指天为誓，</p> 
<p>从此做修士，</p> 
<p>今生隐遁深山过。</p> 
<p>牧羊人唱完了，唐吉诃德请求牧羊人再唱点什么。可桑乔想去睡觉，不愿意再听歌了。他对主人说：</p> 
<p>“您该去过夜的地方休息了。这几位好人劳累了一天，晚上不能再唱了。”</p> 
<p>“我明白了，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“你刚才去拿酒囊喝了酒，现在需要的是睡觉而不是音乐。”</p> 
<p>“感谢上帝，大家都唱得不错。”桑乔说。</p> 
<p>“这我不否认，”唐吉诃德说，“你找地方休息吧。干我这种差事，似乎最好是守夜，而不是睡觉。不过，不管怎样，桑乔，你最好先看看我的耳朵，它疼得太厉害了。”</p> 
<p>桑乔照办了。一个牧羊人看到唐吉诃德的伤，对他说不必着急，自己有个办法，可以使他很快康复。牧羊人拿来几片迷迭香叶子，这种东西当地很多。牧羊人把叶子嚼碎，加上一点儿盐，敷在唐吉诃德的耳朵上，包扎好，说用不着别的药了。唐吉诃德的耳朵果然好了。</p>
