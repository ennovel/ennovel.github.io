However, recalling the advice of his host as to the requisites he ought to carry with him, especially that referring to money and shirts, he determined to go home and provide himself with all, and also with a squire, for he reckoned upon securing a farm-labourer, a neighbour of his, a poor man with a family, but very well qualified for the office of squire to a knight. With this object he turned his horse’s head towards his village, and Rocinante, thus reminded of his old quarters, stepped out so briskly that he hardly seemed to tread the earth.</p> 
<p>He had not gone far, when out of a thicket on his right there seemed to come feeble cries as of some one in distress, and the instant he heard them he exclaimed, “Thanks be to heaven for the favour it accords me, that it so soon offers me an opportunity of fulfilling the obligation I have undertaken, and gathering the fruit of my ambition. These cries, no doubt, come from some man or woman in want of help, and needing my aid and protection;” and wheeling, he turned Rocinante in the direction whence the cries seemed to proceed. He had gone but a few paces into the wood, when he saw a mare tied to an oak, and tied to another, and stripped from the waist upwards, a youth of about fifteen years of age, from whom the cries came. Nor were they without cause, for a lusty farmer was flogging him with a belt and following up every blow with scoldings and commands, repeating, “Your mouth shut and your eyes open!” while the youth made answer, “I won’t do it again, master mine; by God’s passion I won’t do it again, and I’ll take more care of the flock another time.”</p> 
<p>Seeing what was going on, Don Quixote said in an angry voice, “Discourteous knight, it ill becomes you to assail one who cannot defend himself; mount your steed and take your lance” (for there was a lance leaning against the oak to which the mare was tied), “and I will make you know that you are behaving as a coward.” The farmer, seeing before him this figure in full armour brandishing a lance over his head, gave himself up for dead, and made answer meekly, “Sir Knight, this youth that I am chastising is my servant, employed by me to watch a flock of sheep that I have hard by, and he is so careless that I lose one every day, and when I punish him for his carelessness and knavery he says I do it out of niggardliness, to escape paying him the wages I owe him, and before God, and on my soul, he lies.”</p> 
<p>“Lies before me, base clown!” said Don Quixote. “By the sun that shines on us I have a mind to run you through with this lance. Pay him at once without another word; if not, by the God that rules us I will make an end of you, and annihilate you on the spot; release him instantly.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The farmer hung his head, and without a word untied his servant, of whom Don Quixote asked how much his master owed him.</p> 
<p>He replied, nine months at seven reals a month. Don Quixote added it up, found that it came to sixty-three reals, and told the farmer to pay it down immediately, if he did not want to die for it.</p> 
<p>The trembling clown replied that as he lived and by the oath he had sworn (though he had not sworn any) it was not so much; for there were to be taken into account and deducted three pairs of shoes he had given him, and a real for two blood-lettings when he was sick.</p> 
<p>“All that is very well,” said Don Quixote; “but let the shoes and the blood-lettings stand as a setoff against the blows you have given him without any cause; for if he spoiled the leather of the shoes you paid for, you have damaged that of his body, and if the barber took blood from him when he was sick, you have drawn it when he was sound; so on that score he owes you nothing.”</p> 
<p>“The difficulty is, Sir Knight, that I have no money here; let Andres come home with me, and I will pay him all, real by real.”</p> 
<p>“I go with him!” said the youth. “Nay, God forbid! No, senor, not for the world; for once alone with me, he would ray me like a Saint Bartholomew.”</p> 
<p>“He will do nothing of the kind,” said Don Quixote; “I have only to command, and he will obey me; and as he has sworn to me by the order of knighthood which he has received, I leave him free, and I guarantee the payment.”</p> 
<p>“Consider what you are saying, senor,” said the youth; “this master of mine is not a knight, nor has he received any order of knighthood; for he is Juan Haldudo the Rich, of Quintanar.”</p> 
<p>“That matters little,” replied Don Quixote; “there may be Haldudos knights; moreover, everyone is the son of his works.”</p> 
<p>“That is true,” said Andres; “but this master of mine — of what works is he the son, when he refuses me the wages of my sweat and labour?”</p> 
<p>“I do not refuse, brother Andres,” said the farmer, “be good enough to come along with me, and I swear by all the orders of knighthood there are in the world to pay you as I have agreed, real by real, and perfumed.”</p> 
<p>“For the perfumery I excuse you,” said Don Quixote; “give it to him in reals, and I shall be satisfied; and see that you do as you have sworn; if not, by the same oath I swear to come back and hunt you out and punish you; and I shall find you though you should lie closer than a lizard. And if you desire to know who it is lays this command upon you, that you be more firmly bound to obey it, know that I am the valorous Don Quixote of La Mancha, the undoer of wrongs and injustices; and so, God be with you, and keep in mind what you have promised and sworn under those penalties that have been already declared to you.”</p> 
<p>So saying, he gave Rocinante the spur and was soon out of reach. The farmer followed him with his eyes, and when he saw that he had cleared the wood and was no longer in sight, he turned to his boy Andres, and said, “Come here, my son, I want to pay you what I owe you, as that undoer of wrongs has commanded me.”</p> 
<p>“My oath on it,” said Andres, “your worship will be well advised to obey the command of that good knight — may he live a thousand years — for, as he is a valiant and just judge, by Roque, if you do not pay me, he will come back and do as he said.”</p> 
<p>“My oath on it, too,” said the farmer; “but as I have a strong affection for you, I want to add to the debt in order to add to the payment;” and seizing him by the arm, he tied him up again, and gave him such a flogging that he left him for dead.</p> 
<p>“Now, Master Andres,” said the farmer, “call on the undoer of wrongs; you will find he won’t undo that, though I am not sure that I have quite done with you, for I have a good mind to flay you alive.” But at last he untied him, and gave him leave to go look for his judge in order to put the sentence pronounced into execution.</p> 
<p>Andres went off rather down in the mouth, swearing he would go to look for the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha and tell him exactly what had happened, and that all would have to be repaid him sevenfold; but for all that, he went off weeping, while his master stood laughing.</p> 
<p>Thus did the valiant Don Quixote right that wrong, and, thoroughly satisfied with what had taken place, as he considered he had made a very happy and noble beginning with his knighthood, he took the road towards his village in perfect self-content, saying in a low voice, “Well mayest thou this day call thyself fortunate above all on earth, O Dulcinea del Toboso, fairest of the fair! since it has fallen to thy lot to hold subject and submissive to thy full will and pleasure a knight so renowned as is and will be Don Quixote of La Mancha, who, as all the world knows, yesterday received the order of knighthood, and hath to-day righted the greatest wrong and grievance that ever injustice conceived and cruelty perpetrated: who hath to-day plucked the rod from the hand of yonder ruthless oppressor so wantonly lashing that tender child.”</p> 
<p>He now came to a road branching in four directions, and immediately he was reminded of those cross-roads where knights-errant used to stop to consider which road they should take. In imitation of them he halted for a while, and after having deeply considered it, he gave Rocinante his head, submitting his own will to that of his hack, who followed out his first intention, which was to make straight for his own stable. After he had gone about two miles Don Quixote perceived a large party of people, who, as afterwards appeared, were some Toledo traders, on their way to buy silk at Murcia. There were six of them coming along under their sunshades, with four servants mounted, and three muleteers on foot. Scarcely had Don Quixote descried them when the fancy possessed him that this must be some new adventure; and to help him to imitate as far as he could those passages he had read of in his books, here seemed to come one made on purpose, which he resolved to attempt. So with a lofty bearing and determination he fixed himself firmly in his stirrups, got his lance ready, brought his buckler before his breast, and planting himself in the middle of the road, stood waiting the approach of these knights-errant, for such he now considered and held them to be; and when they had come near enough to see and hear, he exclaimed with a haughty gesture, “All the world stand, unless all the world confess that in all the world there is no maiden fairer than the Empress of La Mancha, the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso.”</p> 
<p>The traders halted at the sound of this language and the sight of the strange figure that uttered it, and from both figure and language at once guessed the craze of their owner; they wished, however, to learn quietly what was the object of this confession that was demanded of them, and one of them, who was rather fond of a joke and was very sharp-witted, said to him, “Sir Knight, we do not know who this good lady is that you speak of; show her to us, for, if she be of such beauty as you suggest, with all our hearts and without any pressure we will confess the truth that is on your part required of us.”</p> 
<p>“If I were to show her to you,” replied Don Quixote, “what merit would you have in confessing a truth so manifest? The essential point is that without seeing her you must believe, confess, affirm, swear, and defend it; else ye have to do with me in battle, ill-conditioned, arrogant rabble that ye are; and come ye on, one by one as the order of knighthood requires, or all together as is the custom and vile usage of your breed, here do I bide and await you relying on the justice of the cause I maintain.”</p> 
<p>“Sir Knight,” replied the trader, “I entreat your worship in the name of this present company of princes, that, to save us from charging our consciences with the confession of a thing we have never seen or heard of, and one moreover so much to the prejudice of the Empresses and Queens of the Alcarria and Estremadura, your worship will be pleased to show us some portrait of this lady, though it be no bigger than a grain of wheat; for by the thread one gets at the ball, and in this way we shall be satisfied and easy, and you will be content and pleased; nay, I believe we are already so far agreed with you that even though her portrait should show her blind of one eye, and distilling vermilion and sulphur from the other, we would nevertheless, to gratify your worship, say all in her favour that you desire.”</p> 
<p>“She distils nothing of the kind, vile rabble,” said Don Quixote, burning with rage, “nothing of the kind, I say, only ambergris and civet in cotton; nor is she one-eyed or humpbacked, but straighter than a Guadarrama spindle: but ye must pay for the blasphemy ye have uttered against beauty like that of my lady.”</p> 
<p>And so saying, he charged with levelled lance against the one who had spoken, with such fury and fierceness that, if luck had not contrived that Rocinante should stumble midway and come down, it would have gone hard with the rash trader. Down went Rocinante, and over went his master, rolling along the ground for some distance; and when he tried to rise he was unable, so encumbered was he with lance, buckler, spurs, helmet, and the weight of his old armour; and all the while he was struggling to get up he kept saying, “Fly not, cowards and caitiffs! stay, for not by my fault, but my horse’s , am I stretched here.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>One of the muleteers in attendance, who could not have had much good nature in him, hearing the poor prostrate man blustering in this style, was unable to refrain from giving him an answer on his ribs; and coming up to him he seized his lance, and having broken it in pieces, with one of them he began so to belabour our Don Quixote that, notwithstanding and in spite of his armour, he milled him like a measure of wheat. His masters called out not to lay on so hard and to leave him alone, but the muleteers blood was up, and he did not care to drop the game until he had vented the rest of his wrath, and gathering up the remaining fragments of the lance he finished with a discharge upon the unhappy victim, who all through the storm of sticks that rained on him never ceased threatening heaven, and earth, and the brigands, for such they seemed to him. At last the muleteer was tired, and the traders continued their journey, taking with them matter for talk about the poor fellow who had been cudgelled. He when he found himself alone made another effort to rise; but if he was unable when whole and sound, how was he to rise after having been thrashed and well-nigh knocked to pieces? And yet he esteemed himself fortunate, as it seemed to him that this was a regular knight-errant’s mishap, and entirely, he considered, the fault of his horse. However, battered in body as he was, to rise was beyond his power.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德离开客店时，天已渐亮。他有了骑士称号，满心欢喜，得意洋洋，兴高采烈，差点把马的肚皮给乐破了。他忽然想到店主曾劝导他要带好必要的物品，特别是钱和衬衣，就决定回家把这些东西置办齐，再找一个侍从。他打算找邻居的一个农民。那农民虽穷，还有孩子，可是作骑士的侍从特别合适。这么一想，他就掉转了罗西南多的头。马似乎也知恋家，立刻蹄下生风一般地跑起来。</p> 
<p>没走多远，他就似乎听到右侧的密林中传来微弱的声音，像是有人在呻吟。于是他说：</p> 
<p>“感谢苍天如此迅速赐给我机会，让我尽自己的职责，实现夙愿，旗开得胜。这声音一定是某个贫穷男人或女人在寻求我的照顾和帮助呢。”</p> 
<p>他掉转缰绳，催马循声而去，刚进森林，就看见一棵圣栎树上拴着一匹母马，另一棵树上捆着一个大约十五岁的孩子，上身裸露，声音就是从他嘴里发出来的。原来是一个健壮的农夫正在用腰带抽打这个孩子，每打一下还训斥一声，说：</p> 
<p>“少说话，多长眼。”</p> 
<p>那孩子再三说：</p> 
<p>“我再也不敢了，主人。我向上帝起誓，我再也不敢了。</p> 
<p>我保证以后多加小心，照看好羊群。”</p> 
<p>看到这情景，唐吉诃德不禁怒吼道：</p> 
<p>“无理的骑士，你真不像话，竟与一个不能自卫的人战斗。骑上你的马，拿起你的矛（拴母马的那棵树上正靠着一支长矛），我要让你知道，你这样做不过是个胆小鬼。”</p> 
<p>农夫猛然看见这个全身披挂的人在他面前挥舞长矛，顿时吓得魂不附体，只好客客气气地回答：</p> 
<p>“骑士大人，我正在惩罚的这个孩子是我的佣人，负责照看我在这一带的羊群。可是他太粗心了，每天丢一只羊。我要惩罚这个冒失鬼、无赖。他说我这么做是因为我是个吝啬鬼，想借此赖掉我欠他的工钱。我向上帝，向我的灵魂发誓，他撒谎！”</p> 
<p>“卑鄙的乡巴佬，竟敢在我面前说谎！”唐吉诃德说，“上有太阳作证，我要把你用长矛一下刺穿。你马上付他工钱，否则，有主宰我们的上帝作证，我现在就把你结果掉。你马上把他放开。”</p> 
<p>农夫低下了头，一言不发地为孩子解开了绳子。唐吉诃德问那个孩子，主人欠他多少钱。孩子说一共欠了九个月的工钱，每个月七个雷阿尔。唐吉诃德算了一下，一共六十三个雷阿尔。他告诉农夫，如果不想丢命的话，就立刻掏钱。惊恐的农夫说，生死关头绝无假话，凭他发的誓（他其实没有发过誓），并没有那么多钱，因为还得扣除他给佣人三双鞋的钱和佣人生病时两次输血花的一个雷阿尔。</p> 
<p>“即便如此，”唐吉诃德说，“鞋钱和输血的钱也被你无缘无故地抽打他抵消了。就算他把你给他买的鞋穿破了，可是你也把他的皮打破了；就算他生病时理发师为他输了血，他没病时你却把他打出了血。这样说来，他就不欠你钱了。”</p> 
<p>“骑士大人，问题是我没带钱。让安德烈斯跟我到家去，我如数照付。”</p> 
<p>“跟他去？”孩子说，“没门儿！不，大人，我不去。等到剩下我一个人的时候，他准会像对圣巴多罗美①那样扒了我的皮。”</p> 
<p>①圣巴多罗美是耶稣十二门徒之一，被剥皮而死。</p> 
<p>“不会的，”唐吉诃德说，“只要我命令他听我的，他就得以骑士规则的名义向我发誓，我才放他走。他保证会付给你工钱。”</p> 
<p>“大人，”孩子说，“您是这么说，可我的主人不是骑士，也没有接受过任何骑士称号。他是老财胡安·阿尔杜多，是金塔纳尔的邻居。”</p> 
<p>“这无关紧要，”唐吉诃德说，“阿尔杜多家族里也有骑士，更何况要以事观人嘛。”</p> 
<p>“是的，”安德烈斯说，“可是我这位主人赖了我的血汗钱，该如何以其事观其人呢？”</p> 
<p>“我不会赖帐，安德烈斯兄弟。”农夫说，“请跟我来，我以世界上所有骑士的称号发誓，按照我刚才说的付给你全部工钱，而且还会多些。”</p> 
<p>“多些就不必了，”唐吉诃德说，“你只要如数照付，我就满意了。你发誓就得做到，否则，我也同样发誓会再去找你，惩罚你。即使你比蜥蜴藏得还好，我也一定要找到你。如果你想知道是谁在命令你，好让你更加切实地履行诺言，那么我告诉你，我是曼查的英勇骑士唐吉诃德，专爱打抱不平。再见吧，不要忘记你答应过和发过誓的事情，否则，你就要受到应有的惩罚。”</p> 
<p>说完，唐吉诃德双腿夹了一下罗西南多，很快就跑远了。农夫看着他跑出森林，已经无影无踪了，便转向佣人安德烈斯，对他说：</p> 
<p>“过来，孩子，我想把欠你的钱全部还清，就像那位专爱打抱不平的骑士命令的那样。”</p> 
<p>“这我敢肯定，”安德烈斯说，“你得执行那位优秀骑士的命令。他是位勇敢而又善良的判官，应该活千岁。如果你不付我工钱，他就会回来，按照他说的那样惩罚你。”</p> 
<p>“我也敢肯定。”农夫说，“不过，我太爱你了，所以我想多欠你一点儿，好多多还你钱。”说着农夫抓住孩子的胳膊，又把孩子捆在圣栎树上，狠狠鞭打孩子，差点把他打死。“现在，安德烈斯大人，你去叫那位专爱打抱不平的人吧，看他怎样打这个不平吧，尽管我觉得，要打抱不平，他年纪还不算老。我真想剥了你的皮，你最怕我剥你的皮。”</p> 
<p>不过，农夫最后还是放开了孩子，让孩子去找那位判官来执行他的判决。安德烈斯有些沮丧，临走发誓要去找曼查的英勇骑士唐吉诃德，把刚才的事情一五一十地告诉他，让农夫受到加倍的惩罚。虽然嘴上这么说，孩子还是哭着走的，而农夫却在那里笑。英勇的唐吉诃德就是如此打抱不平的，而且他自己还得意至极，觉得自己在骑士生涯中已经有了一个极其顺利和高尚的开端，对自己非常满意，一面往村里走一面轻声说道：</p> 
<p>“你真是世界上最幸运的人，托博索美丽绝伦的杜尔西内亚！你有幸拥有英勇著名的骑士唐吉诃德在你面前俯首听命。众所周知，他昨天得到了骑士称号，今天又讨伐了最无耻、最残忍的罪恶行径。今天，那个残忍的敌人无缘无故地鞭打那个瘦弱的孩子，他从那个敌人手里夺下了鞭子。”</p> 
<p>这时他来到了一个十字路口，忽然想起游侠骑士常在交叉路口考虑该走哪条路。于是他也装模作样地站了一会儿，最后才考虑成熟了。他放开了罗西南多的缰绳，任它选择。马凭着它的第一感觉，朝着有马群的方向走。走了大约两英里，唐吉诃德看到一大群人，后来才知道，是托莱多的商人去穆尔西亚买丝织品。有六个人打着阳伞，四个佣人骑着马，还有三个骡夫步行。刚从远处发现他们，唐吉诃德就想到又遇上了新的冒险行动。他尽力模仿书上的情节，只要有可能，他就模仿。他觉得又有了一次机会。于是他风度翩翩，威风凛凛地在马上坐定，握紧长矛，把皮盾放在胸前，停在路当中，等待那些游侠骑士到来。他觉得那些人就是游侠骑士。待那些人走到跟他可以互相看得见、听得着的距离时，他傲慢地打了个手势，提高声音，说道：</p> 
<p>“如果你们这些人不承认世界上没有谁比曼查的女皇、托博索的杜尔西内亚更漂亮，就休想过去。”</p> 
<p>听到这番话，商人们都停了下来。看到说话人的奇怪样子，再听他那番话，商人们立刻意识到这是个疯子。不过他们不慌不忙，还想看看他这番话的下文。其中一个人爱开玩笑却又很谨慎，对他说：</p> 
<p>“骑士大人，我们不知道谁是您说的那位美丽夫人，让我们见见她吧。如果她真像您说的那么漂亮，我们诚心诚意地自愿接受您的要求。”</p> 
<p>“你们见到了她，才能承认这样一个明显的事实吗？”唐吉诃德说，“不管你们是否见过她，重要的是你们得相信、承认、肯定、发誓并坚持说她是最漂亮的。否则，你们这些高傲自大的人就得同我兵戎相见。现在，你们或者按照骑士规则一个个来，或者按照你们的习惯和陋习一起上，我都在这里等着你们。我相信正义在我一边。”</p> 
<p>“骑士大人，”那个商人说，“我以在场所有王子的名义请求您，让我们承认我们前所未见、前所未闻的事情，实在于心不安，而且，这会严重伤害阿尔卡利亚和埃斯特雷马杜拉①的那些女皇和王后们。烦请您让我们看看那位夫人的画像吧，哪怕它只像麦粒一般微小。这样一了百了，我们满意了，放心了，您也高兴了，满足了。我们渴望瞻仰她的芳容。即使她在画像上是个独眼，另一只眼流朱砂和硫磺石，为了让您高兴，我们也会按照您的意愿夸奖她。”</p> 
<p>①阿尔卡利亚和埃斯特雷马杜拉是当时西班牙最落后的地区，并非两个国家。</p> 
<p>“无耻的恶棍，”唐吉诃德怒气冲天地说，“她眼里流出的不是你说的那些东西，而是珍贵的琥珀和麝香。她也不是独眼或驼背，而且身子比瓜达拉马的纱锭还直。你们亵渎我如此美丽的夫人，该受到惩罚。”</p> 
<p>说罢，他抓起长矛向刚才说那些话的人刺去。他愤怒至极，要不是幸好罗西南多失蹄跌倒在路上，那位大胆的商人就遭殃了。罗西南多一倒地，它的主人也摔得滚了很远。他想站起来，可是长矛、皮盾、马刺、头盔和沉重的盔甲碍手碍脚，就是站不起来。他挣扎了一番还是站不起来，嘴里仍在说：</p> 
<p>“别跑，胆小鬼，卑贱的人，你们等着。我站不起来，这不怨我，是马的错。”</p> 
<p>其中一个骡夫，也许人不太好，见他倒在地上还如此狂妄，忍不住要把他痛打一顿。那骡夫走过去，抓住长矛，撅成几截，拿起一截抽打唐吉诃德。虽然唐吉诃德身着甲胄，可还是被打得遍体鳞伤，商人们直喊骡夫别打得那么厉害，赶快放了他。可骡夫已经怒不可遏，直打到怒气全消才住手。然后，骡夫捡起其余几截断矛，扔在唐吉诃德身上。唐吉诃德虽然见到乱棍如雨般打在他身上，却仍然不住嘴地吓天吓地，吓唬那些他认为是坏蛋的人。</p> 
<p>骡夫打累了，商人一行又继续赶路，一路上一直谈论这个被打的可怜虫。唐吉诃德看到只剩自己一人了，又试图站起来。可是他身体无恙时都站不起来，现在被打得遍体鳞伤，又怎能站起来呢？他暗自解脱，认为这是游侠骑士必遭之祸，而且全是马的错。他浑身灼痛，自己根本站不起来。</p>
