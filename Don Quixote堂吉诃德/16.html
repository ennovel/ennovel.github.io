Don Quixote and Sancho dismounted, and turning Rocinante and the ass loose to feed on the grass that was there in abundance, they ransacked the alforjas, and without any ceremony very peacefully and sociably master and man made their repast on what they found in them.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Sancho had not thought it worth while to hobble Rocinante, feeling sure, from what he knew of his staidness and freedom from incontinence, that all the mares in the Cordova pastures would not lead him into an impropriety. Chance, however, and the devil, who is not always asleep, so ordained it that feeding in this valley there was a drove of Galician ponies belonging to certain Yanguesan carriers, whose way it is to take their midday rest with their teams in places and spots where grass and water abound; and that where Don Quixote chanced to be suited the Yanguesans’ purpose very well. It so happened, then, that Rocinante took a fancy to disport himself with their ladyships the ponies, and abandoning his usual gait and demeanour as he scented them, he, without asking leave of his master, got up a briskish little trot and hastened to make known his wishes to them; they, however, it seemed, preferred their pasture to him, and received him with their heels and teeth to such effect that they soon broke his girths and left him naked without a saddle to cover him; but what must have been worse to him was that the carriers, seeing the violence he was offering to their mares, came running up armed with stakes, and so belaboured him that they brought him sorely battered to the ground.</p> 
<p>By this time Don Quixote and Sancho, who had witnessed the drubbing of Rocinante, came up panting, and said Don Quixote to Sancho:</p> 
<p>“So far as I can see, friend Sancho, these are not knights but base folk of low birth: I mention it because thou canst lawfully aid me in taking due vengeance for the insult offered to Rocinante before our eyes.”</p> 
<p>“What the devil vengeance can we take,” answered Sancho, “if they are more than twenty, and we no more than two, or, indeed, perhaps not more than one and a half?”</p> 
<p>“I count for a hundred,” replied Don Quixote, and without more words he drew his sword and attacked the Yanguesans and excited and impelled by the example of his master, Sancho did the same; and to begin with, Don Quixote delivered a slash at one of them that laid open the leather jerkin he wore, together with a great portion of his shoulder. The Yanguesans, seeing themselves assaulted by only two men while they were so many, betook themselves to their stakes, and driving the two into the middle they began to lay on with great zeal and energy; in fact, at the second blow they brought Sancho to the ground, and Don Quixote fared the same way, all his skill and high mettle availing him nothing, and fate willed it that he should fall at the feet of Rocinante, who had not yet risen; whereby it may be seen how furiously stakes can pound in angry boorish hands.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Then, seeing the mischief they had done, the Yanguesans with all the haste they could loaded their team and pursued their journey, leaving the two adventurers a sorry sight and in sorrier mood.</p> 
<p>Sancho was the first to come to, and finding himself close to his master he called to him in a weak and doleful voice, “Senor Don Quixote, ah, Senor Don Quixote!”</p> 
<p>“What wouldst thou, brother Sancho?” answered Don Quixote in the same feeble suffering tone as Sancho.</p> 
<p>“I would like, if it were possible,” answered Sancho Panza, “your worship to give me a couple of sups of that potion of the fiery Blas, if it be that you have any to hand there; perhaps it will serve for broken bones as well as for wounds.”</p> 
<p>“If I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?” said Don Quixote; “but I swear to thee, Sancho Panza, on the faith of a knight-errant, ere two days are over, unless fortune orders otherwise, I mean to have it in my possession, or my hand will have lost its cunning.”</p> 
<p>“But in how many does your worship think we shall have the use of our feet?” answered Sancho Panza.</p> 
<p>“For myself I must say I cannot guess how many,” said the battered knight Don Quixote; “but I take all the blame upon myself, for I had no business to put hand to sword against men who where not dubbed knights like myself, and so I believe that in punishment for having transgressed the laws of chivalry the God of battles has permitted this chastisement to be administered to me; for which reason, brother Sancho, it is well thou shouldst receive a hint on the matter which I am now about to mention to thee, for it is of much importance to the welfare of both of us. It is at when thou shalt see rabble of this sort offering us insult thou art not to wait till I draw sword against them, for I shall not do so at all; but do thou draw sword and chastise them to thy heart’s content, and if any knights come to their aid and defence I will take care to defend thee and assail them with all my might; and thou hast already seen by a thousand signs and proofs what the might of this strong arm of mine is equal to” — so uplifted had the poor gentleman become through the victory over the stout Biscayan.</p> 
<p>But Sancho did not so fully approve of his master’s admonition as to let it pass without saying in reply, “Senor, I am a man of peace, meek and quiet, and I can put up with any affront because I have a wife and children to support and bring up; so let it be likewise a hint to your worship, as it cannot be a mandate, that on no account will I draw sword either against clown or against knight, and that here before God I forgive the insults that have been offered me, whether they have been, are, or shall be offered me by high or low, rich or poor, noble or commoner, not excepting any rank or condition whatsoever.”</p> 
<p>To all which his master said in reply, “I wish I had breath enough to speak somewhat easily, and that the pain I feel on this side would abate so as to let me explain to thee, Panza, the mistake thou makest. Come now, sinner, suppose the wind of fortune, hitherto so adverse, should turn in our favour, filling the sails of our desires so that safely and without impediment we put into port in some one of those islands I have promised thee, how would it be with thee if on winning it I made thee lord of it? Why, thou wilt make it well-nigh impossible through not being a knight nor having any desire to be one, nor possessing the courage nor the will to avenge insults or defend thy lordship; for thou must know that in newly conquered kingdoms and provinces the minds of the inhabitants are never so quiet nor so well disposed to the new lord that there is no fear of their making some move to change matters once more, and try, as they say, what chance may do for them; so it is essential that the new possessor should have good sense to enable him to govern, and valour to attack and defend himself, whatever may befall him.”</p> 
<p>“In what has now befallen us,” answered Sancho, “I’d have been well pleased to have that good sense and that valour your worship speaks of, but I swear on the faith of a poor man I am more fit for plasters than for arguments. See if your worship can get up, and let us help Rocinante, though he does not deserve it, for he was the main cause of all this thrashing. I never thought it of Rocinante, for I took him to be a virtuous person and as quiet as myself. After all, they say right that it takes a long time to come to know people, and that there is nothing sure in this life. Who would have said that, after such mighty slashes as your worship gave that unlucky knight-errant, there was coming, travelling post and at the very heels of them, such a great storm of sticks as has fallen upon our shoulders?”</p> 
<p>“And yet thine, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “ought to be used to such squalls; but mine, reared in soft cloth and fine linen, it is plain they must feel more keenly the pain of this mishap, and if it were not that I imagine — why do I say imagine? — know of a certainty that all these annoyances are very necessary accompaniments of the calling of arms, I would lay me down here to die of pure vexation.”</p> 
<p>To this the squire replied, “Senor, as these mishaps are what one reaps of chivalry, tell me if they happen very often, or if they have their own fixed times for coming to pass; because it seems to me that after two harvests we shall be no good for the third, unless God in his infinite mercy helps us.”</p> 
<p>“Know, friend Sancho,” answered Don Quixote, “that the life of knights-errant is subject to a thousand dangers and reverses, and neither more nor less is it within immediate possibility for knights-errant to become kings and emperors, as experience has shown in the case of many different knights with whose histories I am thoroughly acquainted; and I could tell thee now, if the pain would let me, of some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have mentioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes and miseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortal enemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive, gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied to one of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of no small authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pitfall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himself bound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to him one of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh finished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, a great friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I may well suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignities which they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know, Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be in hand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in express words: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has in his hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason that he whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imagine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore suffered any indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, were nothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carried rapier, sword, or dagger.”</p> 
<p>“They gave me no time to see that much,” answered Sancho, “for hardly had I laid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with their sticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out of my feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all those stake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain of the blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as on my shoulders.”</p> 
<p>“For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza,” said Don Quixote, “that there is no recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death does not remove.”</p> 
<p>“And what greater misfortune can there be,” replied Panza, “than the one that waits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were one of those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I am beginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won’t be enough to put us right.”</p> 
<p>“No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,” returned Don Quixote, “and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me that not the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.”</p> 
<p>“There is nothing wonderful in that,” replied Sancho, “since he is a knight-errant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free where we come out scotched.”</p> 
<p>“Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,” said Don Quixote; “I say so because this little beast may now supply the want of Rocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of my wounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for I remember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of the gay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very contentedly mounted on a handsome ass.”</p> 
<p>“It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says,” answered Sancho, “but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung like a sack of manure.”</p> 
<p>To which Don Quixote replied, “Wounds received in battle confer honour instead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee before, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whatever fashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us in these wilds.”</p> 
<p>“And yet I have heard your worship say,” observed Panza, “that it is very meet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it very good fortune.”</p> 
<p>“That is,” said Don Quixote, “when they cannot help it, or when they are in love; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained two years on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, without their ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for — I know not if it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; at any rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the Princess Oriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste before a mishap like Rocinante’s befalls the ass.”</p> 
<p>“The very devil would be in it in that case,” said Sancho; and letting off thirty “ohs,” and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations on whomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with all his pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to the excessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had he possessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his master would have been behind him.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on the ass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, he proceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high road might be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to better, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he perceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote must needs be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was not one, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settled they had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without any further controversy.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>①杨瓜斯是西班牙的一个地方。</p> 
<p>根据圣贤锡德·哈迈德·贝嫩赫利的记载，唐吉诃德告别了牧羊人以及在克里索斯托莫葬礼上见到的所有人，与他的侍从一起钻进了牧羊姑娘马塞拉走进的那片树林。他们在树林里走了近两个小时，四处寻找马塞拉，最后来到一片绿草如茵的平地上，旁边有一条清澈的小溪缓缓流淌。此时正当夏日炎炎，他们不由自主地要在此午休。唐吉诃德和桑乔翻身下马，让罗西南多和驴子尽情吃草，自己也把褡裢来了个底朝上。主仆二人无拘无束，把袋子里的东西美美地吃了个一干二净。</p> 
<p>桑乔没有给罗西南多套上绊索。他知道罗西南多很温驯，很少发情，科尔多瓦牧场的所有母马都不会令它动邪念。可是命运和魔鬼并不总是睡觉，那个地方正巧有杨瓜斯人喂养的一群加利西亚小母马在吃草。杨瓜斯人常常在这个地方午休，正好让他们的小马吃草饮水。这个地方很合他们的心意，而唐吉诃德停留之处也正是这个地方。结果，这回罗西南多忽然心血来潮地要同母马们开开心。它未经主人的许可，嗅着母马们的气味溜达着走过去，后来竟碎步跑起来，要去同母马合欢。可是，母马们当时觉得最需要的是吃草，而不是合欢，于是报之以蹄子踢和嘴巴啃。不一会儿，罗西南多就弄得肚带断，鞍子脱落，浑身光溜溜了。不过，最令它难忘的还是那些脚夫们看到罗西南多要对母马施暴，便手持木棒赶来，一顿痛打，打得它浑身是伤，躺在地上起不来。</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德和桑乔看到罗西南多被打，气喘吁吁地跑来。唐吉诃德对桑乔说：</p> 
<p>“依我看，桑乔朋友，这些人不是骑士，只是一群下人。我是说，你可以帮助我。现在罗西南多受到了伤害，我们得为它报仇。”</p> 
<p>“报什么鬼仇呀，”桑乔说，“他们有二十多人，咱们只不过两个人，也许还只能说是一个半人。”</p> 
<p>“我以一当百。”唐吉诃德说。</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德不再说什么，持剑向杨瓜斯人冲去。桑乔受主人鼓舞，也跟着冲了上去。唐吉诃德首先刺中了对方一个人，把他的皮衣划开了一个大口子，背上的皮也撕掉了一块。</p> 
<p>那几个杨瓜斯人看到他们只有两个人，仗着自己人多，手持木棒拥上来，把两人围在中间，痛打起来，没两下便把桑乔打倒在地。唐吉诃德虽然技术高超，勇气过人，也同样被打倒了。他希望幸运能够降临到罗西南多脚下，可罗西南多终究还是未能站起来，可见那些粗人的怒棒打得多么沉重。杨瓜斯人看到闯了大祸，赶紧把货物放到马背上启程赶路，只剩下两个垂头丧气的征险者。</p> 
<p>桑乔首先醒来。他来到主人身边，声音凄惨地叫道：</p> 
<p>“唐吉诃德大人！哎，唐吉诃德大人！”</p> 
<p>“干什么，桑乔兄弟？”唐吉诃德说，声调和桑乔一样软弱凄惨。</p> 
<p>“如果您手里有那个什么布拉斯的圣水，”桑乔说，“能不能给我喝两口？兴许它能治断骨，也能治伤口呢。”</p> 
<p>“真倒霉！要是我手头有这种圣水，那还怕什么呢？”唐吉诃德说，“不过，桑乔·潘萨，我以游侠骑士的名义发誓，如果不是命运另有安排，用不了两天，我就会有这种圣水。”</p> 
<p>“您看我们过多少天才能走路呢？”桑乔问。</p> 
<p>“我只能说，我也不知道得过多少天。”唐吉诃德说，“这都怨我，我不应该举剑向那些人进攻。他们同我不一样，不是受封骑士。我违反了骑士规则。我觉得是战神让杨瓜斯人惩罚我。所以，桑乔·潘萨，你最好记住我下面说的话，这对咱们俩都很重要：如果你再看到这样的无赖跟我们捣乱，可别等我举剑向他们进攻，我不会再那样做了。你应该举剑进攻，任意处置他们。如果有骑士来帮助保护他们，我也会来保护你，全力惩治他们。你大概已经无数次地体察到我这雄健臂膀的力量了吧。”</p> 
<p>这位曾经战胜过勇猛的比斯开人的可怜大人显得不可一世。</p> 
<p>可是，桑乔·潘萨却对主人说的不以为然。他说道：“大人，我是个和气、安稳、本分的人。我还有老婆孩子，所以我可以容忍所有的挑衅。我也可以告诉您，我不会听从您的指使。不管是无赖还是骑士，我都不会持剑进攻他们。而且从现在开始，直到见上帝的时候，不管什么人欺辱我，不管是高的、矮的、贫的、富的、贵人或是老百姓，我都宽恕他们，毫无例外。”</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德听后说道：</p> 
<p>“现在我这肋骨疼得厉害，我应该再有点精神，这样就可以说得轻松些，使你明白你的错误所左，桑乔。过来，罪人，咱们一直走背运。如果现在时来运转，鼓起咱们愿望的风帆，咱们肯定会驶进我许诺过的某个岛屿的港口。如果我征服了这个岛，把他封给你，你行吗？你肯定不行，因为你不是骑士，也不想是骑士，而且连为你所遭受的侮辱报仇，以维护自己尊严的勇气和企图都没有。你应该知道，在那些刚刚征服的王国和省份里，当地人的情绪不会平静，也并不那么服从新主人。新主人不必害怕他们兴风作浪、重蹈覆辙，或者像他们说的那样，碰碰运气。这就需要新的统治者有治理的才智和应付各种事件、保护自己的勇气。”</p> 
<p>“这种事情现在就发生了。”桑乔说，“我也希望具有您所说的那些才智和勇气。可是我以一个穷人的名义发誓，我最需要的是膏药，而不是训诫。您看看自己是否能站起来，或者咱们去帮帮罗西南多吧，尽管它并不配我们去帮助，因为它是造成咱们被痛打的主要原因。我从未想到罗西南多竟会是这样，我一直把它看成贞洁的，像我一样老实。反正俗话说得对，‘日久见人心’，‘世事莫测’。您向那个倒霉的游侠骑士猛刺之后，谁能料到还会有乱棍打在咱们的背上呢？”</p> 
<p>“桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“你的背想必已习惯于风雨，可是我的背却弱不禁风，这回挨打，自然会疼得很厉害。可是我想，不，不是什么我想！我肯定，要习武就肯定会有这类痛苦，不然的话，我早就气死了。”</p> 
<p>桑乔说：</p> 
<p>“如果这些倒霉的事情是骑士的必然结果，那么请您告诉我，它是频频发生呢，还是在特定的时候才降临？我觉得像这种事情，如果上帝不以他的无限怜悯帮助咱们，咱们有两次也就完蛋了，用不着第三次。”</p> 
<p>“你知道，桑乔朋友，”唐吉诃德说，“游侠骑士的生活就是与成千的危险和不幸联系在一起的，不过，他们同样也有可能成为国王或皇帝，很多游侠骑士的经历就证明了这一点，我对此十分清楚。如果我身上不疼的话，现在就可以给你讲几个游侠骑士的故事。他们仅仅凭着自己臂膀的力量爬到了我刚才说的那种高位，而在此前后他们经历过各种苦难磨砺。高卢的英勇的阿马迪斯就曾落到他的死敌阿尔卡劳斯魔法师手里。阿尔卡劳斯抓住他以后，把他捆在院子里的一根桩子上，用马缰绳打了他两百下，这是确凿无疑的。还有一位不大出名的作家，也是很可信的，说太阳神骑士有一回在某个城堡里掉进了陷阱。他手脚被捆着，一下子就落进了地下的深渊，还被喂了用水、雪、沙混合而成的所谓药品，差点儿丢了性命。要不是一位聪明的老朋友在这个倒霉的时候救了他，这位可怜的骑士可就惨了。</p> 
<p>“我也可以列入这类优秀人物。他们遭受的磨难比咱们现在遭受的要大得多。我可以告诉你，桑乔，被对方用随手拿起来的东西打出伤来并不算耻辱，这是决斗法规上明确写明的。假如修鞋匠随手用楦子打伤别人，不能说那个人被用棍子打了一顿，尽管楦子也是棍子。我这样说是让你别以为咱们在这次战斗里被打痛了，就是蒙受了耻辱。那些人用来打咱们的家伙不是别的，只是他们手里的木棒。我记得他们当中没有任何人使用了剑或者匕首。”</p> 
<p>“我倒没看那么仔细，”桑乔说，“当时我的手刚要拿剑，肩膀就被他们用松木棒狠揍了一通，什么也看不见了，脚也站不住了，倒在我现在躺的这个地方。我伤心的倒不是这顿棒打算不算羞辱，而是肩上背上被打的疼痛劲儿，那真是刻骨铭心啊。”</p> 
<p>“桑乔兄弟，我得告诉你，”唐吉诃德说，“时间长了，记忆就消失了；人一死，痛苦也就没有了。”</p> 
<p>“那么，还有什么东西比时间才能抹掉的记忆，比死亡才能结束的痛苦更为不幸呢？”桑乔说，“如果咱们的不幸是几块膏药就能够治好的，事情还不算很糟糕。可是我却看到，即使一座医院的所有膏药也不足以治好咱们的伤。”</p> 
<p>“别这么说，桑乔，你得从咱们的短处见出力量来，”唐吉诃德说，“我也会这样做。咱们去看看罗西南多吧，我觉得可怜的它对这场不幸倒一点不在乎。”</p> 
<p>“这倒没什么可夸耀的，”桑乔说，“它也是个游侠骑士呀。我可以夸耀的倒是我的驴没事，没有任何损失。咱们反正没少遭罪。”</p> 
<p>“幸运总是在不幸中网开一面，也让人有所安慰。”唐吉诃德说，“我这样讲是因为这头驴现在可以弥补罗西南多的空缺。它可以驮我到某个城堡去，治治我的伤。我骑这样的牲畜也不算不体面。我记得那个好老头西勒尼①，快乐笑神的家庭教师和导师，进入千门城时就骑着一头很漂亮的驴，而且非常得意。”</p> 
<p>①西勒尼是希腊神话中的一个神，终日饮酒作乐，睡眼惺忪，总要别人扶着或骑在驴上。</p> 
<p>“也许他真的像您说的那样，是骑着驴去的，”桑乔说，“不过，要是像个驴粪袋似的横搭在驴背上，那可跟骑着驴去大不一样。”</p> 
<p>“在战斗中受了伤是光荣，而不是耻辱；所以，潘萨朋友，别说什么了，而是像我刚才说的那样，尽力站起来，用你愿意的任何方式把我扶到你的驴上吧。咱们得在天黑之前离开这里，以免在这荒无人烟的地方遭受袭击。”</p> 
<p>“不过我听您说过，”桑乔说，“游侠骑士每年都有很多时间是在荒山野岭度过的，他们觉得这很幸福。”</p> 
<p>“那只是在迫不得已或者恋爱的时候才如此。”唐吉诃德说，“不过，确实有的骑士苦行了足足两年时间，迎着烈日睡在岩石上；无论严寒酷暑都在野外露宿，连他的意中人都不知道他到哪儿去了。这其中就有阿马迪斯，当时他叫贝尔特内夫罗斯，就在‘卑岩’上住了不知是八年还是八个月，我记得不很清楚了。反正他是在那里受苦，也不知道他夫人奥里亚娜怎么惹他了。不过，咱们别说这个了，桑乔，趁着你的驴和罗西南多没再遭别的难，你再使把劲儿。”</p> 
<p>“简直是活见鬼。”桑乔说。</p> 
<p>他们喊了三十声“哎哟”，叹了六十口气，咒骂了一百二十遍引他们到这里来的人，才筋疲力尽地爬起来，站在路中央，就像两只弯弓，总是站不直，费了半天劲，总算给驴备上了鞍。那只驴那天也太逍遥自在了，走起路来有些心不在焉。后来桑乔把罗西南多也扶了起来。如果它能说话，它发的牢骚肯定不比桑乔和唐吉诃德少。桑乔总算把唐吉诃德扶上了驴，又套上罗西南多，拉着驴的缰绳，向他们估计是大路的方向走去。幸亏情况慢慢好转了。他们走了不到一西里路，一条道路就出现在他们面前，路旁还有个客店，唐吉诃德认为那是城堡。桑乔坚持说是客店，主人则说不是客店，是城堡，他们争论不休，一直争到门前，桑乔领着一行人走进去，也不再争辩了。</p>
