<p>“What giants?” said Sancho Panza.</p> 
<p>“Those thou seest there,” answered his master, “with the long arms, and some have them nearly two leagues long.”</p> 
<p>“Look, your worship,” said Sancho; “what we see there are not giants but windmills, and what seem to be their arms are the sails that turned by the wind make the millstone go.”</p> 
<p>“It is easy to see,” replied Don Quixote, “that thou art not used to this business of adventures; those are giants; and if thou art afraid, away with thee out of this and betake thyself to prayer while I engage them in fierce and unequal combat.”</p> 
<p>So saying, he gave the spur to his steed Rocinante, heedless of the cries his squire Sancho sent after him, warning him that most certainly they were windmills and not giants he was going to attack. He, however, was so positive they were giants that he neither heard the cries of Sancho, nor perceived, near as he was, what they were, but made at them shouting, “Fly not, cowards and vile beings, for a single knight attacks you.”</p> 
<p>A slight breeze at this moment sprang up, and the great sails began to move, seeing which Don Quixote exclaimed, “Though ye flourish more arms than the giant Briareus, ye have to reckon with me.”</p> 
<p>So saying, and commending himself with all his heart to his lady Dulcinea, imploring her to support him in such a peril, with lance in rest and covered by his buckler, he charged at Rocinante’s fullest gallop and fell upon the first mill that stood in front of him; but as he drove his lance-point into the sail the wind whirled it round with such force that it shivered the lance to pieces, sweeping with it horse and rider, who went rolling over on the plain, in a sorry condition. Sancho hastened to his assistance as fast as his ass could go, and when he came up found him unable to move, with such a shock had Rocinante fallen with him.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“God bless me!” said Sancho, “did I not tell your worship to mind what you were about, for they were only windmills? and no one could have made any mistake about it but one who had something of the same kind in his head.”</p> 
<p>“Hush, friend Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “the fortunes of war more than any other are liable to frequent fluctuations; and moreover I think, and it is the truth, that that same sage Friston who carried off my study and books, has turned these giants into mills in order to rob me of the glory of vanquishing them, such is the enmity he bears me; but in the end his wicked arts will avail but little against my good sword.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“God order it as he may,” said Sancho Panza, and helping him to rise got him up again on Rocinante, whose shoulder was half out; and then, discussing the late adventure, they followed the road to Puerto Lapice, for there, said Don Quixote, they could not fail to find adventures in abundance and variety, as it was a great thoroughfare. For all that, he was much grieved at the loss of his lance, and saying so to his squire, he added, “I remember having read how a Spanish knight, Diego Perez de Vargas by name, having broken his sword in battle, tore from an oak a ponderous bough or branch, and with it did such things that day, and pounded so many Moors, that he got the surname of Machuca, and he and his descendants from that day forth were called Vargas y Machuca. I mention this because from the first oak I see I mean to rend such another branch, large and stout like that, with which I am determined and resolved to do such deeds that thou mayest deem thyself very fortunate in being found worthy to come and see them, and be an eyewitness of things that will with difficulty be believed.”</p> 
<p>“Be that as God will,” said Sancho, “I believe it all as your worship says it; but straighten yourself a little, for you seem all on one side, may be from the shaking of the fall.”</p> 
<p>“That is the truth,” said Don Quixote, “and if I make no complaint of the pain it is because knights-errant are not permitted to complain of any wound, even though their bowels be coming out through it.”</p> 
<p>“If so,” said Sancho, “I have nothing to say; but God knows I would rather your worship complained when anything ailed you. For my part, I confess I must complain however small the ache may be; unless this rule about not complaining extends to the squires of knights-errant also.”</p> 
<p>Don Quixote could not help laughing at his squire’s simplicity, and he assured him he might complain whenever and however he chose, just as he liked, for, so far, he had never read of anything to the contrary in the order of knighthood.</p> 
<p>Sancho bade him remember it was dinner-time, to which his master answered that he wanted nothing himself just then, but that he might eat when he had a mind. With this permission Sancho settled himself as comfortably as he could on his beast, and taking out of the alforjas what he had stowed away in them, he jogged along behind his master munching deliberately, and from time to time taking a pull at the bota with a relish that the thirstiest tapster in Malaga might have envied; and while he went on in this way, gulping down draught after draught, he never gave a thought to any of the promises his master had made him, nor did he rate it as hardship but rather as recreation going in quest of adventures, however dangerous they might be. Finally they passed the night among some trees, from one of which Don Quixote plucked a dry branch to serve him after a fashion as a lance, and fixed on it the head he had removed from the broken one. All that night Don Quixote lay awake thinking of his lady Dulcinea, in order to conform to what he had read in his books, how many a night in the forests and deserts knights used to lie sleepless supported by the memory of their mistresses. Not so did Sancho Panza spend it, for having his stomach full of something stronger than chicory water he made but one sleep of it, and, if his master had not called him, neither the rays of the sun beating on his face nor all the cheery notes of the birds welcoming the approach of day would have had power to waken him. On getting up he tried the bota and found it somewhat less full than the night before, which grieved his heart because they did not seem to be on the way to remedy the deficiency readily. Don Quixote did not care to break his fast, for, as has been already said, he confined himself to savoury recollections for nourishment.</p> 
<p>They returned to the road they had set out with, leading to Puerto Lapice, and at three in the afternoon they came in sight of it. “Here, brother Sancho Panza,” said Don Quixote when he saw it, “we may plunge our hands up to the elbows in what they call adventures; but observe, even shouldst thou see me in the greatest danger in the world, thou must not put a hand to thy sword in my defence, unless indeed thou perceivest that those who assail me are rabble or base folk; for in that case thou mayest very properly aid me; but if they be knights it is on no account permitted or allowed thee by the laws of knighthood to help me until thou hast been dubbed a knight.”</p> 
<p>“Most certainly, senor,” replied Sancho, “your worship shall be fully obeyed in this matter; all the more as of myself I am peaceful and no friend to mixing in strife and quarrels: it is true that as regards the defence of my own person I shall not give much heed to those laws, for laws human and divine allow each one to defend himself against any assailant whatever.”</p> 
<p>“That I grant,” said Don Quixote, “but in this matter of aiding me against knights thou must put a restraint upon thy natural impetuosity.”</p> 
<p>“I will do so, I promise you,” answered Sancho, “and will keep this precept as carefully as Sunday.”</p> 
<p>While they were thus talking there appeared on the road two friars of the order of St. Benedict, mounted on two dromedaries, for not less tall were the two mules they rode on. They wore travelling spectacles and carried sunshades; and behind them came a coach attended by four or five persons on horseback and two muleteers on foot. In the coach there was, as afterwards appeared, a Biscay lady on her way to Seville, where her husband was about to take passage for the Indies with an appointment of high honour. The friars, though going the same road, were not in her company; but the moment Don Quixote perceived them he said to his squire, “Either I am mistaken, or this is going to be the most famous adventure that has ever been seen, for those black bodies we see there must be, and doubtless are, magicians who are carrying off some stolen princess in that coach, and with all my might I must undo this wrong.”</p> 
<p>“This will be worse than the windmills,” said Sancho. “Look, senor; those are friars of St. Benedict, and the coach plainly belongs to some travellers: I tell you to mind well what you are about and don’t let the devil mislead you.”</p> 
<p>“I have told thee already, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “that on the subject of adventures thou knowest little. What I say is the truth, as thou shalt see presently.”</p> 
<p>So saying, he advanced and posted himself in the middle of the road along which the friars were coming, and as soon as he thought they had come near enough to hear what he said, he cried aloud, “Devilish and unnatural beings, release instantly the highborn princesses whom you are carrying off by force in this coach, else prepare to meet a speedy death as the just punishment of your evil deeds.”</p> 
<p>The friars drew rein and stood wondering at the appearance of Don Quixote as well as at his words, to which they replied, “Senor Caballero, we are not devilish or unnatural, but two brothers of St. Benedict following our road, nor do we know whether or not there are any captive princesses coming in this coach.”</p> 
<p>“No soft words with me, for I know you, lying rabble,” said Don Quixote, and without waiting for a reply he spurred Rocinante and with levelled lance charged the first friar with such fury and determination, that, if the friar had not flung himself off the mule, he would have brought him to the ground against his will, and sore wounded, if not killed outright. The second brother, seeing how his comrade was treated, drove his heels into his castle of a mule and made off across the country faster than the wind.</p> 
<p>Sancho Panza, when he saw the friar on the ground, dismounting briskly from his ass, rushed towards him and began to strip off his gown. At that instant the friars muleteers came up and asked what he was stripping him for. Sancho answered them that this fell to him lawfully as spoil of the battle which his lord Don Quixote had won. The muleteers, who had no idea of a joke and did not understand all this about battles and spoils, seeing that Don Quixote was some distance off talking to the travellers in the coach, fell upon Sancho, knocked him down, and leaving hardly a hair in his beard, belaboured him with kicks and left him stretched breathless and senseless on the ground; and without any more delay helped the friar to mount, who, trembling, terrified, and pale, as soon as he found himself in the saddle, spurred after his companion, who was standing at a distance looking on, watching the result of the onslaught; then, not caring to wait for the end of the affair just begun, they pursued their journey making more crosses than if they had the devil after them.</p> 
<p>Don Quixote was, as has been said, speaking to the lady in the coach: “Your beauty, lady mine,” said he, “may now dispose of your person as may be most in accordance with your pleasure, for the pride of your ravishers lies prostrate on the ground through this strong arm of mine; and lest you should be pining to know the name of your deliverer, know that I am called Don Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant and adventurer, and captive to the peerless and beautiful lady Dulcinea del Toboso: and in return for the service you have received of me I ask no more than that you should return to El Toboso, and on my behalf present yourself before that lady and tell her what I have done to set you free.”</p> 
<p>One of the squires in attendance upon the coach, a Biscayan, was listening to all Don Quixote was saying, and, perceiving that he would not allow the coach to go on, but was saying it must return at once to El Toboso, he made at him, and seizing his lance addressed him in bad Castilian and worse Biscayan after his fashion, “Begone, caballero, and ill go with thee; by the God that made me, unless thou quittest coach, slayest thee as art here a Biscayan.”</p> 
<p>Don Quixote understood him quite well, and answered him very quietly, “If thou wert a knight, as thou art none, I should have already chastised thy folly and rashness, miserable creature.” To which the Biscayan returned, “I no gentleman! — I swear to God thou liest as I am Christian: if thou droppest lance and drawest sword, soon shalt thou see thou art carrying water to the cat: Biscayan on land, hidalgo at sea, hidalgo at the devil, and look, if thou sayest otherwise thou liest.”</p> 
<p>“’“You will see presently,” said Agrajes,’” replied Don Quixote; and throwing his lance on the ground he drew his sword, braced his buckler on his arm, and attacked the Biscayan, bent upon taking his life.</p> 
<p>The Biscayan, when he saw him coming on, though he wished to dismount from his mule, in which, being one of those sorry ones let out for hire, he had no confidence, had no choice but to draw his sword; it was lucky for him, however, that he was near the coach, from which he was able to snatch a cushion that served him for a shield; and they went at one another as if they had been two mortal enemies. The others strove to make peace between them, but could not, for the Biscayan declared in his disjointed phrase that if they did not let him finish his battle he would kill his mistress and everyone that strove to prevent him. The lady in the coach, amazed and terrified at what she saw, ordered the coachman to draw aside a little, and set herself to watch this severe struggle, in the course of which the Biscayan smote Don Quixote a mighty stroke on the shoulder over the top of his buckler, which, given to one without armour, would have cleft him to the waist. Don Quixote, feeling the weight of this prodigious blow, cried aloud, saying, “O lady of my soul, Dulcinea, flower of beauty, come to the aid of this your knight, who, in fulfilling his obligations to your beauty, finds himself in this extreme peril.” To say this, to lift his sword, to shelter himself well behind his buckler, and to assail the Biscayan was the work of an instant, determined as he was to venture all upon a single blow. The Biscayan, seeing him come on in this way, was convinced of his courage by his spirited bearing, and resolved to follow his example, so he waited for him keeping well under cover of his cushion, being unable to execute any sort of manoeuvre with his mule, which, dead tired and never meant for this kind of game, could not stir a step.</p> 
<p>On, then, as aforesaid, came Don Quixote against the wary Biscayan, with uplifted sword and a firm intention of splitting him in half, while on his side the Biscayan waited for him sword in hand, and under the protection of his cushion; and all present stood trembling, waiting in suspense the result of blows such as threatened to fall, and the lady in the coach and the rest of her following were making a thousand vows and offerings to all the images and shrines of Spain, that God might deliver her squire and all of them from this great peril in which they found themselves. But it spoils all, that at this point and crisis the author of the history leaves this battle impending, giving as excuse that he could find nothing more written about these achievements of Don Quixote than what has been already set forth. It is true the second author of this work was unwilling to believe that a history so curious could have been allowed to fall under the sentence of oblivion, or that the wits of La Mancha could have been so undiscerning as not to preserve in their archives or registries some documents referring to this famous knight; and this being his persuasion, he did not despair of finding the conclusion of this pleasant history, which, heaven favouring him, he did find in a way that shall be related in the Second Part.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>这时他们发现了田野里的三十四架风车。</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德一看见风车就对侍从说：</p> 
<p>“命运的安排比我们希望的还好。你看那儿，桑乔·潘萨朋友，就有三十多个放肆的巨人。我想同他们战斗，要他们所有人的性命。有了战利品，我们就可以发财了。这是正义的战斗。从地球表面清除这些坏种是对上帝的一大贡献。”</p> 
<p>“什么巨人？”桑乔·潘萨问。</p> 
<p>“就是你看见的那些长臂家伙，有的臂长足有两西里①呢。”唐吉诃德说。</p> 
<p>①此处为西班牙里程单位，简称为西里，一西里为5572．7米。</p> 
<p>“您看，”桑乔说，“那些不是巨人，是风车。那些像长臂的东西是风车翼，靠风转动，能够推动石磨。”</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德说：“在征险方面你还是外行。他们是巨人。如果你害怕了，就靠边站，我去同他们展开殊死的搏斗。”</p> 
<p>说完他便催马向前。侍从桑乔大声喊着告诉他，他进攻的肯定是风车，不是巨人。可他全然不理会，已经听不见侍从桑乔的喊叫，认定那就是巨人，到了风车跟前也没看清那是什么东西，只是高声喊道：</p> 
<p>“不要逃跑，你们这些胆小的恶棍！向你们进攻的只是骑士孤身一人。”这时起了点风，大风车翼开始转动，唐吉诃德见状便说：</p> 
<p>“即使你们的手比布里亚柔斯①的手还多，也逃脱不了我的惩罚。”</p> 
<p>①布里亚柔斯是希腊神话人物，又称埃盖翁，据说有五十个头、一百只手。</p> 
<p>他又虔诚地请他的杜尔西内亚夫人保佑他，请她在这个关键时刻帮助他。说完他戴好护胸，攥紧长矛，飞马上前，冲向前面的第一个风车。长矛刺中了风车翼，可疾风吹动风车翼，把长矛折断成几截，把马和骑士重重地摔倒在田野上。桑乔催驴飞奔而来救护他，只见唐吉诃德已动弹不得。是马把他摔成了这个样子。</p> 
<p>“上帝保佑！”桑乔说，“我不是告诉您了吗，看看您在干什么？那是风车，除非谁脑袋里也有了风车，否则怎么能不承认那是风车呢？”</p> 
<p>“住嘴，桑乔朋友！”唐吉诃德说，“战斗这种事情，比其它东西更为变化无常。我愈想愈认为，是那个偷了我的书房和书的贤人弗雷斯通把这些巨人变成了风车，以剥夺我战胜他而赢得的荣誉。他对我敌意颇深。不过到最后，他的恶毒手腕终究敌不过我的正义之剑。”</p> 
<p>“让上帝尽力而为吧。”桑乔·潘萨说。</p> 
<p>桑乔扶唐吉诃德站起来，重新上马。那匹马已经东倒西歪了。他们谈论着刚才的险遇，继续向拉皮塞隘口方向赶路。唐吉诃德说那儿旅客多，可能会遇到各种各样的凶险。他最难过的是长矛没有了。他对侍从说：</p> 
<p>“我记得在小说里看到过，一位叫迭戈·佩雷斯·德巴尔加斯的西班牙骑士，在一次战斗中折断了剑。他从圣栎树上砍下了一根大树枝。那天他用这根树枝做了很多事情，打倒了许多摩尔人，落了个绰号马丘卡。从那天起，他以及他的后代就叫巴尔加斯和马丘卡。我说这些是因为假如碰到一棵圣栎树或栎树，我就想折一根大树枝，要和我想象的那根一样好。我要用它做一番事业。你真幸运，能看到并证明这些几乎令人难以相信的事情。”</p> 
<p>“靠上帝恩赐吧，”桑乔说，“我相信您说的话。不过请您坐直点，现在身子都歪到一边去了，大概是摔痛了。”</p> 
<p>“是的，”唐吉诃德说，“我没哼哼，是因为游侠骑士不能因为受伤而呻吟，即使肠子流出来也不能叫唤。”</p> 
<p>“既然这样，我就没什么说的了。”桑乔说，“不过只有上帝知道，我倒是希望您既然痛就别忍着。反正我有点儿痛就得哼哼，除非规定游侠骑士的侍从也不能叫唤。”</p> 
<p>看到侍从如此单纯，唐吉诃德忍不住笑了。唐吉诃德对他说，不论他愿意不愿意，他可以随时任意哼哼，反正直到此时，他还没读到过认为这违反骑士规则的说法。桑乔说该是吃饭的时候了。他的主人却说还没必要，而桑乔想吃也可以吃。既然得到了准许，桑乔就在驴背上坐好，从褡裢里拿出吃的，远远地跟在主人后面边走边吃，还不时拿起酒囊津津有味地呷一口，那个样子，就是马拉加①最有福气的酒店老板见了也会嫉妒。桑乔呷着酒，早把主人对他许的诺言忘得一干二净了，觉得这样到处征险并不怎么累，挺轻松的。</p> 
<p>①马拉加是西班牙的著名酒产地。</p> 
<p>最后，他们在几棵树之间的空地上度过了那个夜晚。唐吉诃德还折了一根干树枝，把断矛上的铁矛头安上去，权当长矛。唐吉诃德彻夜未眠。他要模拟书中描写的样子，想念杜尔西内亚。书里的那些骑士常常在荒林中几夜不睡觉，以想念夫人作为排遣。桑乔可不是这样。他酒足饭饱，一觉睡到天亮。阳光照耀在他脸上，小鸟欢欣鸣啭，新的一天到来了。要不是主人叫醒他，他还不起来呢。起来后，他摸了一下酒囊，发现比前一天晚上瘪了些，不禁一阵心痛，他知道没有办法马上补充这个酒囊。唐吉诃德还是不想吃东西，就像前面说的，他要靠美好的回忆为生。他们又踏上了通往拉皮塞隘口的路程。大约三点钟，他们看见了隘口。</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德一看见隘口就说：“桑乔·潘萨兄弟，我们会在这里深深卷入被称为冒险的事业。不过你要注意，即使你看见我遇到了世界上最严重的险情，只要冒犯我的人不是恶棍和下等人，你就不要用你的剑来保护我。如果是恶棍和下等人，你可以帮助我。但如果是骑士，你就不能来帮助我。这是骑士规则所不允许的，除非你已经被封为骑士。”</p> 
<p>“是的，大人，”桑乔说，“我完全听从您的吩咐，尤其是我本人生性平和，不愿招惹是非。可是说真的，要是该我自卫了，我可不管那些规则，因为不管是神的规则还是世俗的规则，都允许对企图侵犯自己的人实行自卫。”</p> 
<p>“我也没说不是这样，”唐吉诃德说，“不过，在帮助我进攻骑士这点上，你还是得约束自己的冲动天性。”</p> 
<p>桑乔说：“我会像记着礼拜日一样记着这点，照此行事。”</p> 
<p>他们正说着话，路上出现了两个圣贝尼托教会的教士，骑着两匹骆驼一般大的骡子，戴着风镜，打着阳伞。后面跟着一辆车，车旁边有四五个骑马的人和两个步行的骡夫相随。后来才知道，车上是位比斯开贵夫人，要去塞维利亚，她的丈夫正在那儿，准备赴西印度群岛荣任官职。教士虽然同那一行人走的是同一条路，但并不是那位夫人的随行人员。唐吉诃德一发现他们，便对桑乔说：</p> 
<p>“如果我没有弄错的话，这大概就是前所未有的奇遇了。那些黑乎乎的东西可能是——不，肯定是几个魔法师，他们劫持了车上的公主。我必须全力铲除这种罪恶行为。”</p> 
<p>“这比风车的事还糟糕，”桑乔说，“您小心，大人，那是圣贝尼托教会的教士，那辆车肯定是某位过路客人的。您小心，我跟您说，您看看您在干什么吧，千万别让魔鬼搞昏了头。”</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德说：“我对你说过，桑乔，关于征险的事情你知道得不多。我说的是真的，你马上就会看到。”说完，他冲上去，迎着两个教士站到路中间。待估计他们能听到自己的声音时，唐吉诃德高声喊道：</p> 
<p>“你们这些罪恶的魔鬼，把你们劫持的公主立刻放掉，否则，你们马上就会为你们的罪恶行径而受到正义的惩罚。”</p> 
<p>两个教士勒住缰绳，被唐吉诃德的装束和话弄得莫名其妙，说：</p> 
<p>“骑士大人，我们不是罪恶的魔鬼，而是圣贝尼托教会的两个教士。我们赶自己的路，不知道这辆车上是不是有被劫持的公主。”</p> 
<p>“花言巧语对我不起作用。我认识你们这些卑鄙的家伙。”</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德说。</p> 
<p>不等两人回答，唐吉诃德便催马提矛冲向走在前面的教士。他怒气冲冲，凶猛至极，要不是那个教士自己滚落下马，唐吉诃德准会把他刺下马，那就严重了，即使不死，也得重伤。第二个教士看到自己的同伴这个样子，便夹紧那匹快骡的肚子，朝田野疾风般遁去。</p> 
<p>桑乔·潘萨看到教士落地，便立刻下驴，跑到他身边，开始剥他的衣服。这时，教士的两个伙计赶来，问他为什么要扒教士的衣服。桑乔说，作为主人唐吉诃德打胜这一仗的战利品、这衣服理所当然属于他。两个伙计不懂得竟有这等荒唐事，也不明白什么战利品、打仗之类的事情，看到唐吉诃德正在同车上的人说话，便冲上去，把桑乔打倒在地，把他的头发和胡子都拔光了，还猛踢一顿，打得他躺在地上，不见气息，晕了过去。</p> 
<p>那教士又惊又怕，面无血色，不敢滞留片刻，赶紧翻身上骡，催骡向逃跑的教士方向跑去。那个教士正远远地观望，看这场意外的遭遇如何收场。两个教士不愿等到最后结局，便继续赶路，一路上还划着十字，仿佛身后有什么魔鬼跟着似的。</p> 
<p>上面说过，唐吉诃德正在和车上的夫人说话。他说：</p> 
<p>“尊贵的夫人，您可以任意行动了。现在，劫持您的匪徒已经被我有力的臂膀打得威风扫地。您不必打听解救您的人的名字，您知道，我是曼查的唐吉诃德，一位游侠骑士和冒险家，托博索美丽无比的杜尔西内亚的追随者。作为您从我这里所得好处的报答，我只希望您能够到托博索去，替我拜见那位夫人，告诉她我为解救您所做的一切。”</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德的这番话被一个跟车的侍从听到了。他也是比斯开人，看到唐吉诃德无意放车前行，而是说让他们回到托博索去，就走到唐吉诃德面前，抓住唐吉诃德的长矛，用蹩脚的西班牙语和更蹩脚的比斯开语说道：</p> 
<p>“滚开，骑士，真讨厌。我向创造我的上帝发誓，如果你还不让车走，你就是自取灭亡！”</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德听得十分清楚。他十分平静地回答：</p> 
<p>“但愿你是骑士，正因为你不是骑士，我才没有对你如此放肆无礼予以惩罚，臭东西！”</p> 
<p>比斯开人说：</p> 
<p>“我不是骑士？我向上帝发誓，就像你这个基督教徒向上帝撒谎一样！如果你投矛拔剑，你就会看到‘水把猫冲走有多快’！陆地上的比斯开人，在海上是英雄，面对魔鬼也是英雄！而你呢，只会胡说八道，还会干什么？”</p> 
<p>“阿格拉赫①说，看剑！”唐吉诃德说。</p> 
<p>①阿格拉赫是《高卢的阿马迪斯》里的一个人物。他常持剑说：“看剑！”</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德把长矛扔在地上，拔出剑，端着护胸盾，向比斯开人冲去，一心要把他置于死地。</p> 
<p>比斯开人一看唐吉诃德这架势，想下骡应战。真要打，那租来的破骡子靠不住。可是已经晚了，他只好抽剑迎战，又顺手从车内抽出一个坐垫当盾牌。两人对打起来，仿佛是两个不共戴天的仇敌。其余的人让他们别打了，可是他们不听。那个比斯开人还结结巴巴地说，如果不让他们交战，他就要把女主人和所有干扰他的人都杀掉。车上的夫人被眼前的景象吓得惊魂失魄，目瞪口呆。她让车夫把车赶远些，遥遥观看这场激战。比斯开人从护胸盾牌上侧向唐吉诃德的胳膊砍了一剑。要不是唐吉诃德有所防备，早就被齐腰劈成两半了。</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德觉得肩上受到了重重的一击，便大叫一声：</p> 
<p>“哦，我的宝贝夫人，绝世佳丽杜尔西内亚，请您来帮助您的骑士吧！为了报答您的恩宠，他现在正挺身迎战。”</p> 
<p>说完，他握紧剑，拿好护胸盾，马上向比斯开人进攻，决意一剑见高低。</p> 
<p>比斯开人看到唐吉诃德这么凶猛地冲来，决定以勇对勇。可那骡子已疲惫不堪，并且也不习惯这类事情，依然寸步不移。比斯开人无可奈何，只好用坐垫挡住自己的身体。</p> 
<p>前面说过，唐吉诃德举剑向那狡猾的比斯开人冲去，决意把他劈成两半。比斯开人也同样举着剑，用坐垫挡护着自己，迎战唐吉诃德。观战的人都心惊胆战，提心吊胆，唯恐这番激战惹出什么事来，威胁到自己。车上的夫人和其他女仆不停地向西班牙所有神像和寺院祈祷，乞求上帝把比斯开人和她们从巨大的危险中解救出来。</p> 
<p>可最糟糕的是，这个故事的作者讲到此时戛然而止，推诿说，除了谈过的内容之外，没有找到更多有关唐吉诃德事迹的材料。而这部著作的第二位作者实在不愿意相信这部奇书会被人遗忘，不愿意相信曼查的文人会如此冷漠，没有在他们的资料或写字台里保留一些有关这位著名骑士的文献。这样一想，他就对找到有关这个平淡故事的最后结局有信心了。天助也，他居然找到了。至于如何找到的，请看故事的第二部分①。</p> 
<p>①塞万提斯最初把本书的上卷分为四部分，但后来又改变了这种做法。</p>
