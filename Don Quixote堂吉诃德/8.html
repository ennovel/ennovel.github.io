<p>When they reached Don Quixote he was already out of bed, and was still shouting and raving, and slashing and cutting all round, as wide awake as if he had never slept.</p> 
<p>They closed with him and by force got him back to bed, and when he had become a little calm, addressing the curate, he said to him, “Of a truth, Senor Archbishop Turpin, it is a great disgrace for us who call ourselves the Twelve Peers, so carelessly to allow the knights of the Court to gain the victory in this tourney, we the adventurers having carried off the honour on the three former days.”</p> 
<p>“Hush, gossip,” said the curate; “please God, the luck may turn, and what is lost to-day may be won to-morrow; for the present let your worship have a care of your health, for it seems to me that you are over-fatigued, if not badly wounded.”</p> 
<p>“Wounded no,” said Don Quixote, “but bruised and battered no doubt, for that bastard Don Roland has cudgelled me with the trunk of an oak tree, and all for envy, because he sees that I alone rival him in his achievements. But I should not call myself Reinaldos of Montalvan did he not pay me for it in spite of all his enchantments as soon as I rise from this bed. For the present let them bring me something to eat, for that, I feel, is what will be more to my purpose, and leave it to me to avenge myself.”</p> 
<p>They did as he wished; they gave him something to eat, and once more he fell asleep, leaving them marvelling at his madness.</p> 
<p>That night the housekeeper burned to ashes all the books that were in the yard and in the whole house; and some must have been consumed that deserved preservation in everlasting archives, but their fate and the laziness of the examiner did not permit it, and so in them was verified the proverb that the innocent suffer for the guilty.</p> 
<p>One of the remedies which the curate and the barber immediately applied to their friend’s disorder was to wall up and plaster the room where the books were, so that when he got up he should not find them (possibly the cause being removed the effect might cease), and they might say that a magician had carried them off, room and all; and this was done with all despatch. Two days later Don Quixote got up, and the first thing he did was to go and look at his books, and not finding the room where he had left it, he wandered from side to side looking for it. He came to the place where the door used to be, and tried it with his hands, and turned and twisted his eyes in every direction without saying a word; but after a good while he asked his housekeeper whereabouts was the room that held his books.</p> 
<p>The housekeeper, who had been already well instructed in what she was to answer, said, “What room or what nothing is it that your worship is looking for? There are neither room nor books in this house now, for the devil himself has carried all away.”</p> 
<p>“It was not the devil,” said the niece, “but a magician who came on a cloud one night after the day your worship left this, and dismounting from a serpent that he rode he entered the room, and what he did there I know not, but after a little while he made off, flying through the roof, and left the house full of smoke; and when we went to see what he had done we saw neither book nor room: but we remember very well, the housekeeper and I, that on leaving, the old villain said in a loud voice that, for a private grudge he owed the owner of the books and the room, he had done mischief in that house that would be discovered by-and-by: he said too that his name was the Sage Munaton.”</p> 
<p>“He must have said Friston,” said Don Quixote.</p> 
<p>“I don’t know whether he called himself Friston or Friton,” said the housekeeper, “I only know that his name ended with ‘ton.’”</p> 
<p>“So it does,” said Don Quixote, “and he is a sage magician, a great enemy of mine, who has a spite against me because he knows by his arts and lore that in process of time I am to engage in single combat with a knight whom he befriends and that I am to conquer, and he will be unable to prevent it; and for this reason he endeavours to do me all the ill turns that he can; but I promise him it will be hard for him to oppose or avoid what is decreed by Heaven.”</p> 
<p>“Who doubts that?” said the niece; “but, uncle, who mixes you up in these quarrels? Would it not be better to remain at peace in your own house instead of roaming the world looking for better bread than ever came of wheat, never reflecting that many go for wool and come back shorn?”</p> 
<p>“Oh, niece of mine,” replied Don Quixote, “how much astray art thou in thy reckoning: ere they shear me I shall have plucked away and stripped off the beards of all who dare to touch only the tip of a hair of mine.”</p> 
<p>The two were unwilling to make any further answer, as they saw that his anger was kindling.</p> 
<p>In short, then, he remained at home fifteen days very quietly without showing any signs of a desire to take up with his former delusions, and during this time he held lively discussions with his two gossips, the curate and the barber, on the point he maintained, that knights-errant were what the world stood most in need of, and that in him was to be accomplished the revival of knight-errantry. The curate sometimes contradicted him, sometimes agreed with him, for if he had not observed this precaution he would have been unable to bring him to reason.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile Don Quixote worked upon a farm labourer, a neighbour of his, an honest man (if indeed that title can be given to him who is poor), but with very little wit in his pate. In a word, he so talked him over, and with such persuasions and promises, that the poor clown made up his mind to sally forth with him and serve him as esquire. Don Quixote, among other things, told him he ought to be ready to go with him gladly, because any moment an adventure might occur that might win an island in the twinkling of an eye and leave him governor of it. On these and the like promises Sancho Panza (for so the labourer was called) left wife and children, and engaged himself as esquire to his neighbour.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Don Quixote next set about getting some money; and selling one thing and pawning another, and making a bad bargain in every case, he got together a fair sum. He provided himself with a buckler, which he begged as a loan from a friend, and, restoring his battered helmet as best he could, he warned his squire Sancho of the day and hour he meant to set out, that he might provide himself with what he thought most needful. Above all, he charged him to take alforjas with him. The other said he would, and that he meant to take also a very good ass he had, as he was not much given to going on foot. About the ass, Don Quixote hesitated a little, trying whether he could call to mind any knight-errant taking with him an esquire mounted on ass-back, but no instance occurred to his memory. For all that, however, he determined to take him, intending to furnish him with a more honourable mount when a chance of it presented itself, by appropriating the horse of the first discourteous knight he encountered. Himself he provided with shirts and such other things as he could, according to the advice the host had given him; all which being done, without taking leave, Sancho Panza of his wife and children, or Don Quixote of his housekeeper and niece, they sallied forth unseen by anybody from the village one night, and made such good way in the course of it that by daylight they held themselves safe from discovery, even should search be made for them.</p> 
<p>Sancho rode on his ass like a patriarch, with his alforjas and bota, and longing to see himself soon governor of the island his master had promised him. Don Quixote decided upon taking the same route and road he had taken on his first journey, that over the Campo de Montiel, which he travelled with less discomfort than on the last occasion, for, as it was early morning and the rays of the sun fell on them obliquely, the heat did not distress them.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>And now said Sancho Panza to his master, “Your worship will take care, Senor Knight-errant, not to forget about the island you have promised me, for be it ever so big I’ll be equal to governing it.”</p> 
<p>To which Don Quixote replied, “Thou must know, friend Sancho Panza, that it was a practice very much in vogue with the knights-errant of old to make their squires governors of the islands or kingdoms they won, and I am determined that there shall be no failure on my part in so liberal a custom; on the contrary, I mean to improve upon it, for they sometimes, and perhaps most frequently, waited until their squires were old, and then when they had had enough of service and hard days and worse nights, they gave them some title or other, of count, or at the most marquis, of some valley or province more or less; but if thou livest and I live, it may well be that before six days are over, I may have won some kingdom that has others dependent upon it, which will be just the thing to enable thee to be crowned king of one of them. Nor needst thou count this wonderful, for things and chances fall to the lot of such knights in ways so unexampled and unexpected that I might easily give thee even more than I promise thee.”</p> 
<p>“In that case,” said Sancho Panza, “if I should become a king by one of those miracles your worship speaks of, even Juana Gutierrez, my old woman, would come to be queen and my children infantes.”</p> 
<p>“Well, who doubts it?” said Don Quixote.</p> 
<p>“I doubt it,” replied Sancho Panza, “because for my part I am persuaded that though God should shower down kingdoms upon earth, not one of them would fit the head of Mari Gutierrez. Let me tell you, senor, she is not worth two maravedis for a queen; countess will fit her better, and that only with God’s help.”</p> 
<p>“Leave it to God, Sancho,” returned Don Quixote, “for he will give her what suits her best; but do not undervalue thyself so much as to come to be content with anything less than being governor of a province.”</p> 
<p>“I will not, senor,” answered Sancho, “specially as I have a man of such quality for a master in your worship, who will know how to give me all that will be suitable for me and that I can bear.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>这时，忽听唐吉诃德咆哮起来：</p> 
<p>“来吧，来吧，勇敢的骑士们，是显示你们勇敢臂膀的力量的时候了，现在是宫廷骑士得势。”</p> 
<p>人们都循吵闹声赶去，其他书就没有再继续检查，估计《卡罗莱亚》、《西班牙的狮子》和路易斯·德阿维拉的《皇帝旧事》顷刻之间已化为灰烬。这几本大概都藏在剩下的那堆书里，神甫倘若看到这几本书，也许不会让它们遭受这样严厉的处罚。</p> 
<p>大家赶到时，唐吉诃德已经起床了，正继续大喊大叫，到处乱扎乱刺，那个精神劲儿，一点儿也不像刚睡醒的样子。大家抱住他，硬把他按在床上。他安静了一会儿，又开始对神甫说：</p> 
<p>“特平大主教大人，我们这些号称十二廷臣的人竟让这些宫廷骑士在这场战斗中大获全胜，真是奇耻大辱。前三天，我们这些征险骑士还连战连捷呢。”</p> 
<p>“您安静点儿，老兄。”神甫说，“上帝会保佑我们时来运转的。‘失之今日，得于明天’，您现在需要注意身体。我觉得您大概太累了，要不就是受了重伤。”</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德说：“没有受伤，不过浑身仿佛散了架，这倒是真的。那个婊子养的罗尔丹用圣栎木棍差点把我打散架。他完全是出于嫉妒，就因为我是他斗勇的敌手。待我能从床上起来时，不管他有多少魔法，我都要报仇，否则我就不叫雷纳尔多斯·德蒙塔尔万。现在，先给我弄点吃的，我知道这对我最合适。报仇的事就留给我吧。”</p> 
<p>吃的拿来了，他又睡着了。他疯成这样，使大家目瞪口呆。</p> 
<p>那天晚上，女管家把畜栏里和家里所有的书都烧了。那些本应留作永久资料的书，命运和懒惰的检查官并没有放过它们，也烧掉了。这就应验了那句俗语：“刚正常为罪恶受过”。</p> 
<p>神甫和理发师拯救朋友的一个办法，就是把唐吉诃德那间书房砌上砖堵死，让他伤好后找不到那些书（说不定会病除根断），说魔法师把书房和里面所有的东西都带走了。他们说做就做。两天后，唐吉诃德起床了。他做的第一件事就是去看他的书。可是他找不到原来放书的房间，就逐间搜寻，走到原来是门的地方，用手摸了摸，四处张望，默默无语。过了好一阵，他问女管家书房在什么地方。女管家很清楚该怎样回答，对他说：</p> 
<p>“您找什么房，什么东西？这里没有书也没有房，都让魔鬼带走了。”</p> 
<p>“不是魔鬼，”外甥女说，“是位魔法师。您走后的一个晚上，魔法师腾云而来。他从蛇背上下来，走进房间。我也不知道他在里面干什么。不一会儿，他从房顶飞出，房间里全是烟。待我们想起过去看看他究竟干了什么，已经是书、房皆空了。我和管家记得十分清楚，那个老东西临走时大声说，他和那些书籍以及房间的主人有私仇，对那间房子的处置随后就可见分晓。他还说他是圣贤穆尼亚通。”</p> 
<p>“大概说的是弗雷斯通。”唐吉诃德说。</p> 
<p>女管家说：“我也不知道是说弗雷斯通还是弗里通，只知道最后一个字是‘通’。”</p> 
<p>“是啊，”唐吉诃德说，“那是一个狡猾的魔法师，我的大敌，对我嫉恨如仇。他先天有灵，预知过一段时间后，会有他手下的一个骑士来同我展开恶战。我定会取胜，他却无可奈何，所以他要对我竭尽破坏之能事。我断定，苍天安排好的事，他很难违拗和逃脱。”</p> 
<p>“这还用问吗？”外甥女说，“可是舅舅，谁让您去管那些事？在家里老老实实呆着，别到处去管闲事难道不好吗？况且弄不好的话，‘毛未剪成反被剪’呢。”</p> 
<p>“你搞错了，外甥女，”唐吉诃德说，“谁想剪我的毛，不等他碰到我一根头发梢，我早已把他的毛全都剃光拔掉了。”</p> 
<p>两个女人怕再勾起唐吉诃德的火气，不再言语。这样，唐吉诃德在家安安静静地住了十五天，没有再想出外疯跑的迹象。在这期间，他成天向两个老朋友神甫和理发师作有趣的讲述。他说世界上最需要的就是游侠骑士，而且他对游侠骑士的崛起责无旁贷。神甫有时表示反对，有时不得不让步。如果不采取这种方法，就无法和唐吉诃德谈下去。</p> 
<p>这时候，唐吉诃德又去游说相邻的一位农夫。那农夫是个好人（如果这个称号可以送给穷人的话），就是缺少头脑。唐吉诃德对农夫又说又劝又许愿，总之，那个可怜的农夫决定跟他出走，去做他的侍从。唐吉诃德为了让农夫心甘情愿地跟他走，说也许会在某次历险之后，转眼之间得到一个岛屿，那就让农夫做岛屿的总督。如此这番许愿之后，桑乔·潘萨，也就是那个农夫，决定离开自己的老婆和孩子，充当邻居的侍从。</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德然后下令筹款。有的东西卖了，有的东西典当了，反正都廉价出手，终于筹集了一笔钱。他戴上从朋友那儿借的护胸，勉强扣上破头盔，把他打算上路的日期和时辰通知了侍从桑乔，让桑乔收拾好必需品，特别嘱咐别忘了带个褡裢。桑乔说，定会带上，同时，他还有头驴很不错，也想带上，因为他还不习惯走远路。关于驴的问题，唐吉诃德考虑了一下，回想是否有某位游侠骑士带着骑驴的侍从，结论是前所未有。尽管如此，他还是同意了桑乔带上驴，并打算等到以后有机会，碰上一个无礼骑士，就夺其马，给桑乔换个体面的坐骑。唐吉诃德按照那店主对他说的，带上了衬衣和其他可能带的东西。一切就绪之后，一个夜晚，桑乔没有向老婆和孩子告别，唐吉诃德也没有向女管家和外甥女辞行，就离开了村庄，没有被任何人发现。他们连夜赶路，待到天亮时断定，即使人们找他们也找不到了。</p> 
<p>桑乔带着褡裢和酒囊，骑在驴上神态威严，渴望现在就成为主人承诺的岛屿总督。唐吉诃德碰巧又到了蒙铁尔原野上，也就是他初征失利的地方。这次不像上次那么难受了，正值清晨，太阳斜射在他身上，并没有让他感到疲惫。</p> 
<p>这时，桑乔对他的主人说：</p> 
<p>“游侠骑士大人，您别忘了您许诺的那个岛屿。无论岛有多大，我都能管理。”</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德回答说：</p> 
<p>“你应该知道，桑乔朋友，古时候游侠骑士征服岛屿或王国之后，就封他的侍从做那儿的总督。这是很流行的做法，我决不会破坏这个好习惯，而且我要做得比他们还好。有些时候，也许更多的时候，他们都要等到侍从老了，不愿意再白天受累、晚上吃苦地侍奉他们了，才给侍从封个不大不小的村镇或县区的伯爵，最多是个侯爵。只要你我都活着，我完全可以在六天之内征服一个王国，再加上几个附庸国，你正好可以做一个附庸国的国王。对此你别太当回事。有些前所未闻、连想也不敢想的事情往往会在骑士身上发生。我给你的会比我承诺给你的还多，这很容易做到。”</p> 
<p>桑乔说：“那么，我就可以在您说的某次奇迹中当上国王，我老婆安娜·古铁雷斯至少是王后，我的儿子也成王子了。”</p> 
<p>“难道还有谁对此怀疑吗？”唐吉诃德说。</p> 
<p>“我就怀疑，”桑乔说，“对于我来说，即使上帝让王国似雨点一般从天而降，也不会有一个正好落在玛丽·古铁雷斯①头上。您知道，大人，王后也算不上什么，当女伯爵最好。这得靠上帝相助。”</p> 
<p>①桑乔说他妻子叫胡安娜，此处又称玛丽。在下文中，他妻子则自称特雷莎·卡斯卡霍。</p> 
<p>“那你就向上帝乞求吧，”唐吉诃德说，“他会给你一个最合适的位置。不过你别太自卑。你至少得做个总督才行。”</p> 
<p>“我不做总督，大人。”桑乔说，“我愿意跟随尊贵的主人。所有的职位，只要对我合适，我又承担得起，您都会给我的。”</p>
