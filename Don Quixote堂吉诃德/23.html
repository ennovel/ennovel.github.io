With them there came also two men on horseback and two on foot; those on horseback with wheel-lock muskets, those on foot with javelins and swords, and as soon as Sancho saw them he said:</p> 
<p>“That is a chain of galley slaves, on the way to the galleys by force of the king’s orders.”</p> 
<p>“How by force?” asked Don Quixote; “is it possible that the king uses force against anyone?”</p> 
<p>“I do not say that,” answered Sancho, “but that these are people condemned for their crimes to serve by force in the king’s galleys.”</p> 
<p>“In fact,” replied Don Quixote, “however it may be, these people are going where they are taking them by force, and not of their own will.”</p> 
<p>“Just so,” said Sancho.</p> 
<p>“Then if so,” said Don Quixote, “here is a case for the exercise of my office, to put down force and to succour and help the wretched.”</p> 
<p>“Recollect, your worship,” said Sancho, “Justice, which is the king himself, is not using force or doing wrong to such persons, but punishing them for their crimes.”</p> 
<p>The chain of galley slaves had by this time come up, and Don Quixote in very courteous language asked those who were in custody of it to be good enough to tell him the reason or reasons for which they were conducting these people in this manner. One of the guards on horseback answered that they were galley slaves belonging to his majesty, that they were going to the galleys, and that was all that was to be said and all he had any business to know.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“Nevertheless,” replied Don Quixote, “I should like to know from each of them separately the reason of his misfortune;” to this he added more to the same effect to induce them to tell him what he wanted so civilly that the other mounted guard said to him:</p> 
<p>“Though we have here the register and certificate of the sentence of every one of these wretches, this is no time to take them out or read them; come and ask themselves; they can tell if they choose, and they will, for these fellows take a pleasure in doing and talking about rascalities.”</p> 
<p>With this permission, which Don Quixote would have taken even had they not granted it, he approached the chain and asked the first for what offences he was now in such a sorry case.</p> 
<p>He made answer that it was for being a lover.</p> 
<p>“For that only?” replied Don Quixote; “why, if for being lovers they send people to the galleys I might have been rowing in them long ago.”</p> 
<p>“The love is not the sort your worship is thinking of,” said the galley slave; “mine was that I loved a washerwoman’s basket of clean linen so well, and held it so close in my embrace, that if the arm of the law had not forced it from me, I should never have let it go of my own will to this moment; I was caught in the act, there was no occasion for torture, the case was settled, they treated me to a hundred lashes on the back, and three years of gurapas besides, and that was the end of it.”</p> 
<p>“What are gurapas?” asked Don Quixote.</p> 
<p>“Gurapas are galleys,” answered the galley slave, who was a young man of about four-and-twenty, and said he was a native of Piedrahita.</p> 
<p>Don Quixote asked the same question of the second, who made no reply, so downcast and melancholy was he; but the first answered for him, and said, “He, sir, goes as a canary, I mean as a musician and a singer.”</p> 
<p>“What!” said Don Quixote, “for being musicians and singers are people sent to the galleys too?”</p> 
<p>“Yes, sir,” answered the galley slave, “for there is nothing worse than singing under suffering.”</p> 
<p>“On the contrary, I have heard say,” said Don Quixote, “that he who sings scares away his woes.”</p> 
<p>“Here it is the reverse,” said the galley slave; “for he who sings once weeps all his life.”</p> 
<p>“I do not understand it,” said Don Quixote; but one of the guards said to him, “Sir, to sing under suffering means with the non sancta fraternity to confess under torture; they put this sinner to the torture and he confessed his crime, which was being a cuatrero, that is a cattle-stealer, and on his confession they sentenced him to six years in the galleys, besides two bundred lashes that he has already had on the back; and he is always dejected and downcast because the other thieves that were left behind and that march here ill-treat, and snub, and jeer, and despise him for confessing and not having spirit enough to say nay; for, say they, ‘nay’ has no more letters in it than ‘yea,’ and a culprit is well off when life or death with him depends on his own tongue and not on that of witnesses or evidence; and to my thinking they are not very far out.”</p> 
<p>“And I think so too,” answered Don Quixote; then passing on to the third he asked him what he had asked the others, and the man answered very readily and unconcernedly, “I am going for five years to their ladyships the gurapas for the want of ten ducats.”</p> 
<p>“I will give twenty with pleasure to get you out of that trouble,” said Don Quixote.</p> 
<p>“That,” said the galley slave, “is like a man having money at sea when he is dying of hunger and has no way of buying what he wants; I say so because if at the right time I had had those twenty ducats that your worship now offers me, I would have greased the notary’s pen and freshened up the attorney’s wit with them, so that to-day I should be in the middle of the plaza of the Zocodover at Toledo, and not on this road coupled like a greyhound. But God is great; patience — there, that’s enough of it.”</p> 
<p>Don Quixote passed on to the fourth, a man of venerable aspect with a white beard falling below his breast, who on hearing himself asked the reason of his being there began to weep without answering a word, but the fifth acted as his tongue and said, “This worthy man is going to the galleys for four years, after having gone the rounds in ceremony and on horseback.”</p> 
<p>“That means,” said Sancho Panza, “as I take it, to have been exposed to shame in public.”</p> 
<p>“Just so,” replied the galley slave, “and the offence for which they gave him that punishment was having been an ear-broker, nay body-broker; I mean, in short, that this gentleman goes as a pimp, and for having besides a certain touch of the sorcerer about him.”</p> 
<p>“If that touch had not been thrown in,” said Don Quixote, “be would not deserve, for mere pimping, to row in the galleys, but rather to command and be admiral of them; for the office of pimp is no ordinary one, being the office of persons of discretion, one very necessary in a well-ordered state, and only to be exercised by persons of good birth; nay, there ought to be an inspector and overseer of them, as in other offices, and recognised number, as with the brokers on change; in this way many of the evils would be avoided which are caused by this office and calling being in the hands of stupid and ignorant people, such as women more or less silly, and pages and jesters of little standing and experience, who on the most urgent occasions, and when ingenuity of contrivance is needed, let the crumbs freeze on the way to their mouths, and know not which is their right hand. I should like to go farther, and give reasons to show that it is advisable to choose those who are to hold so necessary an office in the state, but this is not the fit place for it; some day I will expound the matter to some one able to see to and rectify it; all I say now is, that the additional fact of his being a sorcerer has removed the sorrow it gave me to see these white hairs and this venerable countenance in so painful a position on account of his being a pimp; though I know well there are no sorceries in the world that can move or compel the will as some simple folk fancy, for our will is free, nor is there herb or charm that can force it. All that certain silly women and quacks do is to turn men mad with potions and poisons, pretending that they have power to cause love, for, as I say, it is an impossibility to compel the will.”</p> 
<p>“It is true,” said the good old man, “and indeed, sir, as far as the charge of sorcery goes I was not guilty; as to that of being a pimp I cannot deny it; but I never thought I was doing any harm by it, for my only object was that all the world should enjoy itself and live in peace and quiet, without quarrels or troubles; but my good intentions were unavailing to save me from going where I never expect to come back from, with this weight of years upon me and a urinary ailment that never gives me a moment’s ease;” and again he fell to weeping as before, and such compassion did Sancho feel for him that he took out a real of four from his bosom and gave it to him in alms.</p> 
<p>Don Quixote went on and asked another what his crime was, and the man answered with no less but rather much more sprightliness than the last one.</p> 
<p>“I am here because I carried the joke too far with a couple of cousins of mine, and with a couple of other cousins who were none of mine; in short, I carried the joke so far with them all that it ended in such a complicated increase of kindred that no accountant could make it clear: it was all proved against me, I got no favour, I had no money, I was near having my neck stretched, they sentenced me to the galleys for six years, I accepted my fate, it is the punishment of my fault; I am a young man; let life only last, and with that all will come right. If you, sir, have anything wherewith to help the poor, God will repay it to you in heaven, and we on earth will take care in our petitions to him to pray for the life and health of your worship, that they may be as long and as good as your amiable appearance deserves.”</p> 
<p>This one was in the dress of a student, and one of the guards said he was a great talker and a very elegant Latin scholar.</p> 
<p>Behind all these there came a man of thirty, a very personable fellow, except that when he looked, his eyes turned in a little one towards the other. He was bound differently from the rest, for he had to his leg a chain so long that it was wound all round his body, and two rings on his neck, one attached to the chain, the other to what they call a “keep-friend” or “friend’s foot,” from which hung two irons reaching to his waist with two manacles fixed to them in which his hands were secured by a big padlock, so that he could neither raise his hands to his mouth nor lower his head to his hands. Don Quixote asked why this man carried so many more chains than the others. The guard replied that it was because he alone had committed more crimes than all the rest put together, and was so daring and such a villain, that though they marched him in that fashion they did not feel sure of him, but were in dread of his making his escape.</p> 
<p>“What crimes can he have committed,” said Don Quixote, “if they have not deserved a heavier punishment than being sent to the galleys?”</p> 
<p>“He goes for ten years,” replied the guard, “which is the same thing as civil death, and all that need be said is that this good fellow is the famous Gines de Pasamonte, otherwise called Ginesillo de Parapilla.”</p> 
<p>“Gently, senor commissary,” said the galley slave at this, “let us have no fixing of names or surnames; my name is Gines, not Ginesillo, and my family name is Pasamonte, not Parapilla as you say; let each one mind his own business, and he will be doing enough.”</p> 
<p>“Speak with less impertinence, master thief of extra measure,” replied the commissary, “if you don’t want me to make you hold your tongue in spite of your teeth.”</p> 
<p>“It is easy to see,” returned the galley slave, “that man goes as God pleases, but some one shall know some day whether I am called Ginesillo de Parapilla or not.”</p> 
<p>“Don’t they call you so, you liar?” said the guard.</p> 
<p>“They do,” returned Gines, “but I will make them give over calling me so, or I will be shaved, where, I only say behind my teeth. If you, sir, have anything to give us, give it to us at once, and God speed you, for you are becoming tiresome with all this inquisitiveness about the lives of others; if you want to know about mine, let me tell you I am Gines de Pasamonte, whose life is written by these fingers.”</p> 
<p>“He says true,” said the commissary, “for he has himself written his story as grand as you please, and has left the book in the prison in pawn for two hundred reals.”</p> 
<p>“And I mean to take it out of pawn,” said Gines, “though it were in for two hundred ducats.”</p> 
<p>“Is it so good?” said Don Quixote.</p> 
<p>“So good is it,” replied Gines, “that a fig for ‘Lazarillo de Tormes,’ and all of that kind that have been written, or shall be written compared with it: all I will say about it is that it deals with facts, and facts so neat and diverting that no lies could match them.”</p> 
<p>“And how is the book entitled?” asked Don Quixote.</p> 
<p>“The ‘Life of Gines de Pasamonte,’” replied the subject of it.</p> 
<p>“And is it finished?” asked Don Quixote.</p> 
<p>“How can it be finished,” said the other, “when my life is not yet finished? All that is written is from my birth down to the point when they sent me to the galleys this last time.”</p> 
<p>“Then you have been there before?” said Don Quixote.</p> 
<p>“In the service of God and the king I have been there for four years before now, and I know by this time what the biscuit and courbash are like,” replied Gines; “and it is no great grievance to me to go back to them, for there I shall have time to finish my book; I have still many things left to say, and in the galleys of Spain there is more than enough leisure; though I do not want much for what I have to write, for I have it by heart.”</p> 
<p>“You seem a clever fellow,” said Don Quixote.</p> 
<p>“And an unfortunate one,” replied Gines, “for misfortune always persecutes good wit.”</p> 
<p>“It persecutes rogues,” said the commissary.</p> 
<p>“I told you already to go gently, master commissary,” said Pasamonte; “their lordships yonder never gave you that staff to ill-treat us wretches here, but to conduct and take us where his majesty orders you; if not, by the life of — never mind — ; it may be that some day the stains made in the inn will come out in the scouring; let everyone hold his tongue and behave well and speak better; and now let us march on, for we have had quite enough of this entertainment.”</p> 
<p>The commissary lifted his staff to strike Pasamonte in return for his threats, but Don Quixote came between them, and begged him not to ill-use him, as it was not too much to allow one who had his hands tied to have his tongue a trifle free; and turning to the whole chain of them he said:</p> 
<p>“From all you have told me, dear brethren, make out clearly that though they have punished you for your faults, the punishments you are about to endure do not give you much pleasure, and that you go to them very much against the grain and against your will, and that perhaps this one’s want of courage under torture, that one’s want of money, the other’s want of advocacy, and lastly the perverted judgment of the judge may have been the cause of your ruin and of your failure to obtain the justice you had on your side. All which presents itself now to my mind, urging, persuading, and even compelling me to demonstrate in your case the purpose for which Heaven sent me into the world and caused me to make profession of the order of chivalry to which I belong, and the vow I took therein to give aid to those in need and under the oppression of the strong. But as I know that it is a mark of prudence not to do by foul means what may be done by fair, I will ask these gentlemen, the guards and commissary, to be so good as to release you and let you go in peace, as there will be no lack of others to serve the king under more favourable circumstances; for it seems to me a hard case to make slaves of those whom God and nature have made free. Moreover, sirs of the guard,” added Don Quixote, “these poor fellows have done nothing to you; let each answer for his own sins yonder; there is a God in Heaven who will not forget to punish the wicked or reward the good; and it is not fitting that honest men should be the instruments of punishment to others, they being therein no way concerned. This request I make thus gently and quietly, that, if you comply with it, I may have reason for thanking you; and, if you will not voluntarily, this lance and sword together with the might of my arm shall compel you to comply with it by force.”</p> 
<p>“Nice nonsense!” said the commissary; “a fine piece of pleasantry he has come out with at last! He wants us to let the king’s prisoners go, as if we had any authority to release them, or he to order us to do so! Go your way, sir, and good luck to you; put that basin straight that you’ve got on your head, and don’t go looking for three feet on a cat.”</p> 
<p>’Tis you that are the cat, rat, and rascal,” replied Don Quixote, and acting on the word he fell upon him so suddenly that without giving him time to defend himself he brought him to the ground sorely wounded with a lance-thrust; and lucky it was for him that it was the one that had the musket. The other guards stood thunderstruck and amazed at this unexpected event, but recovering presence of mind, those on horseback seized their swords, and those on foot their javelins, and attacked Don Quixote, who was waiting for them with great calmness; and no doubt it would have gone badly with him if the galley slaves, seeing the chance before them of liberating themselves, had not effected it by contriving to break the chain on which they were strung. Such was the confusion, that the guards, now rushing at the galley slaves who were breaking loose, now to attack Don Quixote who was waiting for them, did nothing at all that was of any use. Sancho, on his part, gave a helping hand to release Gines de Pasamonte, who was the first to leap forth upon the plain free and unfettered, and who, attacking the prostrate commissary, took from him his sword and the musket, with which, aiming at one and levelling at another, he, without ever discharging it, drove every one of the guards off the field, for they took to flight, as well to escape Pasamonte’s musket, as the showers of stones the now released galley slaves were raining upon them. Sancho was greatly grieved at the affair, because he anticipated that those who had fled would report the matter to the Holy Brotherhood, who at the summons of the alarm-bell would at once sally forth in quest of the offenders; and he said so to his master, and entreated him to leave the place at once, and go into hiding in the sierra that was close by.</p> 
<p>“That is all very well,” said Don Quixote, “but I know what must be done now;” and calling together all the galley slaves, who were now running riot, and had stripped the commissary to the skin, he collected them round him to hear what he had to say, and addressed them as follows: “To be grateful for benefits received is the part of persons of good birth, and one of the sins most offensive to God is ingratitude; I say so because, sirs, ye have already seen by manifest proof the benefit ye have received of me; in return for which I desire, and it is my good pleasure that, laden with that chain which I have taken off your necks, ye at once set out and proceed to the city of El Toboso, and there present yourselves before the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, and say to her that her knight, he of the Rueful Countenance, sends to commend himself to her; and that ye recount to her in full detail all the particulars of this notable adventure, up to the recovery of your longed-for liberty; and this done ye may go where ye will, and good fortune attend you.”</p> 
<p>Gines de Pasamonte made answer for all, saying, “That which you, sir, our deliverer, demand of us, is of all impossibilities the most impossible to comply with, because we cannot go together along the roads, but only singly and separate, and each one his own way, endeavouring to hide ourselves in the bowels of the earth to escape the Holy Brotherhood, which, no doubt, will come out in search of us. What your worship may do, and fairly do, is to change this service and tribute as regards the lady Dulcinea del Toboso for a certain quantity of ave-marias and credos which we will say for your worship’s intention, and this is a condition that can be complied with by night as by day, running or resting, in peace or in war; but to imagine that we are going now to return to the flesh-pots of Egypt, I mean to take up our chain and set out for El Toboso, is to imagine that it is now night, though it is not yet ten in the morning, and to ask this of us is like asking pears of the elm tree.”</p> 
<p>“Then by all that’s good,” said Don Quixote (now stirred to wrath), “Don son of a bitch, Don Ginesillo de Paropillo, or whatever your name is, you will have to go yourself alone, with your tail between your legs and the whole chain on your back.”</p> 
<p>Pasamonte, who was anything but meek (being by this time thoroughly convinced that Don Quixote was not quite right in his head as he had committed such a vagary as to set them free), finding himself abused in this fashion, gave the wink to his companions, and falling back they began to shower stones on Don Quixote at such a rate that he was quite unable to protect himself with his buckler, and poor Rocinante no more heeded the spur than if he had been made of brass. Sancho planted himself behind his ass, and with him sheltered himself from the hailstorm that poured on both of them. Don Quixote was unable to shield himself so well but that more pebbles than I could count struck him full on the body with such force that they brought him to the ground; and the instant he fell the student pounced upon him, snatched the basin from his head, and with it struck three or four blows on his shoulders, and as many more on the ground, knocking it almost to pieces. They then stripped him of a jacket that he wore over his armour, and they would have stripped off his stockings if his greaves had not prevented them. From Sancho they took his coat, leaving him in his shirt-sleeves; and dividing among themselves the remaining spoils of the battle, they went each one his own way, more solicitous about keeping clear of the Holy Brotherhood they dreaded, than about burdening themselves with the chain, or going to present themselves before the lady Dulcinea del Toboso. The ass and Rocinante, Sancho and Don Quixote, were all that were left upon the spot; the ass with drooping head, serious, shaking his ears from time to time as if he thought the storm of stones that assailed them was not yet over; Rocinante stretched beside his master, for he too had been brought to the ground by a stone; Sancho stripped, and trembling with fear of the Holy Brotherhood; and Don Quixote fuming to find himself so served by the very persons for whom he had done so much.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>他们不愿去的地方的不幸者</p> 
<p>曼查的阿拉伯作家锡德·哈迈德·贝嫩赫利在这个极其严肃、夸张、细致、优美的虚构故事里讲到，曼查著名的唐吉诃德和他的侍从桑乔·潘萨如第二十一章所述，讲完那番话后，唐吉诃德抬头看到路上迎面走来大约十二个人，一条大铁链拴着他们的脖子，把他们连成一串，而且那些人都戴着手铐。此外，还有两个人骑马，一个人步行。骑马的人带着转轮手枪，步行的人拿着长矛和剑。桑乔一看见他们，就对唐吉诃德说：</p> 
<p>“这是国王强制送去划船的苦役犯。”</p> 
<p>“什么强制苦役犯？”唐吉诃德问，“国王难道会强制某个人吗？”</p> 
<p>“不是这个意思，”桑乔说，“是这些人犯了罪，被判去为国王划船服苦役。”</p> 
<p>“一句话，不管他们愿意不愿意，”唐吉诃德说，“这些人是被强迫带去，而不是自愿的。”</p> 
<p>“是这样。”桑乔说。</p> 
<p>“既然这样，”唐吉诃德说，“那就该行使我的除暴安良的职责了。”</p> 
<p>“您注意点儿，”桑乔说，“法律，也就是国王本人，并没有迫害这类人，而是对他们的罪恶进行惩罚。”</p> 
<p>这时，那些苦役犯已经走近了。唐吉诃德极其礼貌地请那几个押解的人告诉他，究竟为了什么原因押解那些人。一个骑马的捕役回答说，他们是国王陛下的苦役犯，是去划船的，此外就没什么可说的了，连他也只知道这些。</p> 
<p>“即便如此，”唐吉诃德说，“我也想知道每个人被罚做苦役的原因。”</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德又如此这般地补充了一些道理，想动员他们告知他想知道的事情。另一个骑马的捕役说：</p> 
<p>“虽然我们身上带着这帮坏蛋的卷宗和判决书，可是现在不便停下拿出来看。您可以去问他们本人。他们如果愿意，就会告诉您。他们肯定愿意讲。这些人不仅喜欢干他们的卑鄙行径，而且喜欢讲。”</p> 
<p>既然得到允许，唐吉诃德就去问了。其实即使不允许，他也会我行我素。他来到队伍前，问第一个人究竟犯了什么罪，竟落得如此下场。那个人说是因为谈情说爱。</p> 
<p>“仅仅为这个？”唐吉诃德说，“如果因为谈情说爱就被罚做划船苦役，我早被罚到船上去了。”</p> 
<p>“并不是像您想的那种谈情说爱，”苦役犯说，“我喜欢的是一大桶漂白的衣服。我使劲抱着它，若不是司法的力量把我强行拉开，我到现在也不会自己松手。我是被当场抓住的，用不着严刑拷问，审理完毕，我背上挨了一百下，再加上三年整的‘古拉巴’就完事了。”</p> 
<p>“什么是‘古拉巴’？”唐吉诃德问。</p> 
<p>“‘古拉巴’就是罚做划船苦役。”苦役犯回答。这个小伙子至多二十四岁，他说自己是皮德拉伊塔人。</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德又去问第二个人。那人忧心忡忡，一言不发。第一个人替他回答说：</p> 
<p>“大人，他是金丝雀。我是说，他是乐师和歌手。”</p> 
<p>“怎么回事？”唐吉诃德问，“乐师和歌手也要做苦役？”</p> 
<p>“是的，大人，”苦役犯说，“再没有比‘苦唱’更糟糕的事了。”</p> 
<p>“我以前听说，‘一唱解百愁’。”唐吉诃德说。</p> 
<p>“在这儿相反，”苦役犯说，“一唱哭百年。”</p> 
<p>“我不明白。”唐吉诃德说。</p> 
<p>这时一个捕役对唐吉诃德说：</p> 
<p>“骑士大人，在这帮无赖里，‘苦唱’的意思就是在刑讯之下招供。对这个犯人动了刑，他才认了罪。他是盗马贼，也就是偷牲口的。他招认后，判在他背上鞭笞两百下，这个已经执行了，另外再加六年苦役。他总是沉默不语，愁眉不展，因为留在那边的罪犯和在这儿的苦役犯都虐待他，还排挤他，嘲弄他，蔑视他，就因为他招了，不敢说‘不’。他们说‘是’或‘否’都是那么长的音，而且罪犯见识多了，就知道他们的生死不由证人和证据决定，全在自己一张嘴。我觉得他们说得也有道理。”</p> 
<p>“这我就明白了。”唐吉诃德说。</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德又走到第三个人跟前，把刚才问别人的那几句话又问了一遍。那人立刻满不在乎地说：</p> 
<p>“我因为欠人家十个杜卡多①，要去享受五年美妙的古拉巴。”</p> 
<p>①杜卡多是曾用于西班牙和奥匈帝国的金币，也是一种假想的币名。</p> 
<p>“我很愿意给你二十杜卡多，让你从这一苦难中解脱出来。”唐吉诃德说。</p> 
<p>“我觉得这就好比一个身在海上的人有很多钱，”苦役犯说，“他眼看就要饿死了，可就是买不到他所需要的东西。我是说，如果我当时能够得到您现在才给我的这二十杜卡多，我至少可以拿它疏通一下书记员，活动一下检察官，现在则完全可以留在托莱多的索科多韦尔广场上，而不是在这儿像条猎兔狗似的被拴着。不过，上帝是伟大的。耐心等待吧，什么也别说了。”</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德又去问第四个人。第四个人长着尊贵的面容，一副白胡子垂到胸前。听到唐吉诃德问他怎么到这儿来了，他竟哭了起来，一言不发。第五个苦役犯解释说；</p> 
<p>“这位贵人被判了四年苦役，而且临走还被拉着骑在马上，穿着华丽的衣服，在净是熟人的街上招摇过市。”</p> 
<p>“我觉得，”桑乔说，“那是当众羞辱他。”</p> 
<p>“是的，”苦役犯说，“给他判刑的罪名就是给人家的耳朵甚至整个身子牵牵线。其实我是说，这位是拉皮条的。此外，他还会点巫术。”</p> 
<p>“若不是因为他会点巫术，”唐吉诃德说，“单因为他拉皮条，就不该判他做划船苦役，而应该让他去指挥海船，做船队的头头。因为拉皮条这行当并不是随便可以干的。这是机灵人的职业，在治理有方的国家里特别需要，而且必须是出身高贵的人才行。此外，还得像其他行业一样，就像市场上的经纪人那样，有廉洁的知名人士来监督他们。这样可以避免一些蠢货从事这个行业所产生的弊病。像那些平淡无奇的娘儿们，乳臭未干、涉世不深的毛孩子和无赖，关键时刻需要他们拿主意的时候，他们却举棋不定，手足无措。我本来想再说下去，讲讲为什么要对这个国家从事这项必不可少的职业的人进行挑选，可是在这儿讲不合适。等到某一天，我再对能够解决这个问题的人讲吧。</p> 
<p>“我只想说，看到这位两鬓斑白、面容尊贵的老人因为拉皮条被累成这个样子，我感到难过，可是再一想到他会巫术，我又不难过了，虽然我知道世界上并不是像某些头脑简单的人想的那样，有能够动摇和左右人的意志的巫术。我们的意志是自由的，没有任何迷魂药和魔法能够迫使它改变。一些粗俗的女人和居心叵测的骗子常常做些混合剂和春药，让人疯狂，让人们相信它们能催人纵欲，可是我要说，意志是改变不了的。”</p> 
<p>“是的，”那位慈祥的老人说，“说真的，大人，关于巫术的事，我没有罪；拉皮条的事我无法否认，可我从未想到这是做坏事。我只是想让大家都痛痛快快，生活安定，无忧无虑。然而，我的良好愿望并没有给我带来任何好处，我还是得去那个回头无望的地方。我已经这么大年纪了，又有尿道病，这闹得我一刻也不得安宁。”</p> 
<p>说到这儿，他又像刚才一样哭了起来。桑乔看他十分可怜，便从怀里掏出一枚值四雷阿尔的钱币周济他。</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德走过去问另外一个人犯了什么罪。这个人回答得比前面那个人爽快得多。他说：</p> 
<p>“我到了这儿，是因为我同我的两个堂妹和另外两个不是我堂妹的姐妹开玩笑开得太过分了。结果我们的血缘队伍乱了套，连鬼都说不清了。事实确凿，没人帮忙，我又没钱，差点儿丢了脑袋。判我六年苦役，我认了，咎由自取嘛。我还年轻，只要活着，一切都会有希望。假如您，骑士大人，有什么东西能帮帮我们这些可怜人，上帝在天会报答你，我们在地上祈祷时也不会忘记求上帝保佑您长命百岁，身体健康，祝您这样慈祥的人万寿无疆。”</p> 
<p>这时，来了一个学生装束的人。一个捕役说，这个人能言善辩，而且精通拉丁文。</p> 
<p>最后过来的是个相貌端庄的人，年龄约三十岁，只是看东西的时候，一只眼睛总是对向另一只。他的桎梏与其他人不同，脚上拖着一条大铁链，铁链盘在身上，脖子上套着两个铁环，一个连着铁链，另一个拴在一种叫做枷的械具上，下面还有两条锁链一直搭拉到腰间的两只手铐上，手铐上拴着一个大锁，这样他的手够不着嘴，头也不能低下来够着手。</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德问那人为什么他戴的械具比别人多。捕役回答说，因为他一个人犯的罪比其他人所有的罪还多。他是个胆大妄为的家伙，即使这样锁着也还不放心呢，怕他跑了。</p> 
<p>“他犯了什么罪，又判了多少年苦役呢？”唐吉诃德问。</p> 
<p>“判了十年，”捕役说，“相当于剥夺公民权。不过，只要你知道这家伙是大名鼎鼎的希内斯·帕萨蒙特就行了。他还有个名字叫希内西略·帕拉皮利亚。”</p> 
<p>“差官大人，”苦役犯说，“你注意点，别给人胡编名字和绰号。我叫希内斯，而不是希内西略。我的父名叫帕萨蒙特，而不是你说的帕拉皮利亚。各人管好自己的事就行了。”</p> 
<p>“江洋大盗先生，不管你愿意不愿意，你若是不想让我帮你住嘴，说话就小声点儿。”</p> 
<p>“人完全应当像上帝一样受到尊敬，”苦役犯说，“总有一天，我会叫你知道我到底是不是叫希内西略·帕拉皮利亚。”</p> 
<p>“难道别人不是这样叫你吗，骗子？”捕役说。</p> 
<p>“是这么叫，”苦役犯说，“可我会让他们不这么叫的。否则，我就把自己身上几个地方的毛全拔掉。骑士大人，如果你能给我们点什么，就给我们个到此为止，抬腿走人吧。你总打听别人的事情，已经让大家烦了。如果你想知道我的事情，我告诉你，我是希内斯·帕萨蒙特，我正在亲自记录我的生活。”</p> 
<p>“他说的是真的，”捕役说，“他正在写他自己的故事，写得真不错。他在监狱里把书典押了二百雷阿尔。”</p> 
<p>“即使是二百杜卡多，我也要把它赎回来。”希内斯说。</p> 
<p>“书就这么好？”唐吉诃德问。</p> 
<p>“简直可以说太好了，”希内斯说，“与之相比，《托尔梅斯河的领路人》以及其他所有那类书都相形见绌。我可以告诉你，那里面写的全是真事，若是杜撰的，不可能写得那么优美风趣。”</p> 
<p>“书名是什么？”唐吉诃德问。</p> 
<p>“《希内斯·帕萨蒙特传》。”希内斯说。</p> 
<p>“写完了吗？”唐吉诃德问。</p> 
<p>“我的生活还没有完，书怎么能写完了呢？”希内斯说，“写好的是从我出生到上次做划船苦役。”</p> 
<p>“你原来做过划船苦役？”唐吉诃德问。</p> 
<p>“愿为上帝和国王效劳。我那次做了四年苦役，知道了干面包和鞭子的滋味。”希内斯说，“做划船苦役我并不很害怕，我可以在船上写我的书。我有很多话要说，而在西班牙的船上空闲时间很多。其实，我用于书写的时间并不要很多。我主要靠打腹稿。”</p> 
<p>“看来你很聪明。”唐吉诃德说。</p> 
<p>“也很不幸，”希内斯说，“不幸总是伴随着聪明人。”</p> 
<p>“也伴随坏蛋。”捕役说。</p> 
<p>“我已经说过，差官大人，”希内斯说，“你讲话客气点儿。那些大人只是让你把我们带到陛下指定的地方去，并没有给你侮慢我们这些可怜人的权力。你若是再不客气点儿，我发誓……行了，‘说不定哪天客店的事情就会水落石出呢’。谁也别说了，你好好待着，说话客气点儿。已经费半天口舌了，咱们赶路吧。”</p> 
<p>闻此狂言，捕役举棍要打帕萨蒙特。唐吉诃德立刻起身挡住，求他别打帕萨蒙特，说帕萨蒙特手被锁得那么紧，说话有点儿出圈也该谅解。然后，唐吉诃德转身对所有苦役犯说：</p> 
<p>“极其尊贵的弟兄们，听了你们讲的这些话，我弄清楚了，虽然你们是犯了罪才受惩罚，你们却不大愿意受这个苦，很不情愿。看来你们有的人因为受到刑讯时缺乏勇气，有的人因为没钱，有的人因为没有得到帮助，反正都是法官断案不公，你们才落到这种地步，没有得到公正的待遇。所有这些现在都要求我、劝说我甚至迫使我对你们起到老天让我来世上作骑士的作用，实现我扶弱济贫的誓言。</p> 
<p>“不过，我知道聪明一点儿的办法就是能商量的不强求。所以，我想请求这几位捕役和差官大人行行好，放了你们。若是愿意为国王效劳，比这更好的机会还多着呢。我觉得把上帝和大自然的自由人变成奴隶是件残忍的事情。况且，捕役大人，”唐吉诃德说，“这些可怜人丝毫也没有冒犯你们。咎由自取，上帝在天不会忘记惩恶扬善，正直的人也不该去充当别人的刽子手，他们本来就不该干这个。我心平气和地请求你们。如果能做到呢，我会对你们有所答谢，否则，我的长矛和剑，还有我臂膀的力量，就会强迫你们这样做。”</p> 
<p>“可笑的蠢话！”差官说，“说了半天，竟是这等蠢话！你想让我们把国王的犯人放了，就好像我们有权力或者你有权力命令我们把犯人放了似的！走吧，大人，戴好你脑袋上的那个盆儿，趁早赶你的路吧，别在这儿找三爪猫①了。”</p> 
<p>①西班牙成语，意即“自找苦吃”。</p> 
<p>“你就是猫，是老鼠，是混蛋。”唐吉诃德说。</p> 
<p>说完唐吉诃德便冲了上去。差官猝不及防，被长矛刺伤翻倒在地。还算唐吉诃德刺对了，那人身上带着火枪呢。其他人被这突如其来的事情惊呆了。不过他们立刻明白过来，于是骑马的人举起剑，步行的人拿起了标枪，向唐吉诃德冲来。唐吉诃德镇静自若地迎战。要不是那队苦役犯看到他们获得自由的机会已到，纷纷挣脱锁链，企图逃跑，这回唐吉诃德说不定就糟殃了。</p> 
<p>大乱中，捕役们得追赶逃散的苦役犯，又得同与他们激战的唐吉诃德周旋，顾此失彼。桑乔帮着放开了希内斯·帕萨蒙特。希内斯第一个摆脱锁链，投入战斗。他向已经倒在地上的差官冲去，夺下了他的剑和枪，然后用剑指指这个人，又用枪瞄瞄那个人，不过他一直没有开枪。面对希内斯的枪和苦役犯们不断扔来的石头，捕役们全部落荒而逃，整个原野上已看不到他们的踪影。桑乔对此很担心。他想到这些逃跑的人一定会去报告圣友团，那么圣友团马上就会出来追捕苦役犯。桑乔把自己的担心对唐吉诃德讲了，请求他赶快离开那里，躲到附近的山上去。</p> 
<p>“那好，”唐吉诃德说，“不过我知道现在最应该做什么。”</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德叫苦役犯都过来。那些苦役犯吵吵嚷嚷地已经把差官的衣服都剥光了。大家围在一起，听唐吉诃德吩咐什么。唐吉诃德对他们说：</p> 
<p>“出身高贵的人知恩图报，而最惹上帝生气的就是忘恩负义。各位大人，你们已经亲眼看到了你们从我这儿得到的恩典。作为对我的报答，我希望你们带着我从你们脖子上取下的锁链，去托博索拜见杜尔西内亚夫人，告诉她，她的骑士，猥獕骑士，向她致意，并且把这次著名的历险经过，一直到你们获得了渴望已久的自由，都原原本本地向她讲述一遍。然后，你们就各奔前程。”</p> 
<p>希内斯·帕萨蒙特代表大家说：</p> 
<p>“大人，我们的救星，您吩咐的事情万万做不得。我们不可能一起在大路上走，只能各走各的路，争取进到大山深处，才不会被圣友团找到。圣友团肯定已经出动寻找我们了。您能够做的，也应该做的，就是把您对托博索的杜尔西内亚夫人的进见礼，换成让我们按照您的意志念几遍万福玛利亚和《信经》。这件事我们无论白天还是黑夜，无论逃遁还是休息，无论和平时期还是战争年代，都做得到。但是，如果以为我们现已回到了太平盛世，可以拿着锁链去托博索了，那简直是白日说梦，让我们缘木求鱼。”</p> 
<p>“我发誓，”唐吉诃德勃然大怒说，“我要让你这个婊子养的希内西略·帕罗皮略，或者就像他们叫你的那样，我一定要让你一个人老老实实地带着整条锁链去！”</p> 
<p>帕萨蒙特本来就是火暴脾气。他听到唐吉诃德这番胡言乱语，什么要解放他们，却又让他们做蠢事，知道唐吉诃德精神不太正常。他向伙伴们使了个眼色，大家退到一旁，向唐吉诃德投起石头来。石头似雨点般打来，唐吉诃德拿护胸盾遮挡都来不及。而罗西南多也像铜铸一般，任凭唐吉诃德怎么踢都一步不移。桑乔藏在驴后边，躲避向两人铺天盖地打来的石头。唐吉诃德躲避不得，身上不知道挨了多少石头。石头来势凶猛，竟把他打倒在地。他刚倒下，那个学生就扑上来，夺过他头上的铜盆，在他背上砸了三四下，然后又在地上摔了三四下，差点把铜盆摔碎了。他们扒掉唐吉诃德套在甲胄上的短外套，又去脱他的袜子。要不是护胫甲挡着，连袜子也没了。那些人把桑乔的外衣也抢走了。桑乔被剥得只剩下了内衣。那些人把其他战利品也分了，然后就各自逃走了。他们着急的是逃脱圣友团的追捕，而不是带着锁链去拜见托博索的杜尔西内亚。</p> 
<p>现在，只剩下驴和罗西南多，还有桑乔和唐吉诃德。驴低头沉思，不时还晃动一下耳朵，以为那场石雨还没有停止，正从耳边飞过。罗西南多躺在主人身旁，它也是被一阵石头打倒的。只穿着内衣的桑乔仍在为圣友团害怕。唐吉诃德看到自己本来对那些人那么好，却被他们弄成这副样子，气急败坏。</p>
