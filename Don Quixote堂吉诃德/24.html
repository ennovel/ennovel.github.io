If I had believed thy words, I should have avoided this trouble; but it is done now, it is only to have patience and take warning for the future.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“Your worship will take warning as much as I am a Turk,” returned Sancho; “but, as you say this mischief might have been avoided if you had believed me, believe me now, and a still greater one will be avoided; for I tell you chivalry is of no account with the Holy Brotherhood, and they don’t care two maravedis for all the knights-errant in the world; and I can tell you I fancy I hear their arrows whistling past my ears this minute.”</p> 
<p>“Thou art a coward by nature, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “but lest thou shouldst say I am obstinate, and that I never do as thou dost advise, this once I will take thy advice, and withdraw out of reach of that fury thou so dreadest; but it must be on one condition, that never, in life or in death, thou art to say to anyone that I retired or withdrew from this danger out of fear, but only in compliance with thy entreaties; for if thou sayest otherwise thou wilt lie therein, and from this time to that, and from that to this, I give thee lie, and say thou liest and wilt lie every time thou thinkest or sayest it; and answer me not again; for at the mere thought that I am withdrawing or retiring from any danger, above all from this, which does seem to carry some little shadow of fear with it, I am ready to take my stand here and await alone, not only that Holy Brotherhood you talk of and dread, but the brothers of the twelve tribes of Israel, and the Seven Maccabees, and Castor and Pollux, and all the brothers and brotherhoods in the world.”</p> 
<p>“Senor,” replied Sancho, “to retire is not to flee, and there is no wisdom in waiting when danger outweighs hope, and it is the part of wise men to preserve themselves to-day for to-morrow, and not risk all in one day; and let me tell you, though I am a clown and a boor, I have got some notion of what they call safe conduct; so repent not of having taken my advice, but mount Rocinante if you can, and if not I will help you; and follow me, for my mother-wit tells me we have more need of legs than hands just now.”</p> 
<p>Don Quixote mounted without replying, and, Sancho leading the way on his ass, they entered the side of the Sierra Morena, which was close by, as it was Sancho’s design to cross it entirely and come out again at El Viso or Almodovar del Campo, and hide for some days among its crags so as to escape the search of the Brotherhood should they come to look for them. He was encouraged in this by perceiving that the stock of provisions carried by the ass had come safe out of the fray with the galley slaves, a circumstance that he regarded as a miracle, seeing how they pillaged and ransacked.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>That night they reached the very heart of the Sierra Morena, where it seemed prudent to Sancho to pass the night and even some days, at least as many as the stores he carried might last, and so they encamped between two rocks and among some cork trees; but fatal destiny, which, according to the opinion of those who have not the light of the true faith, directs, arranges, and settles everything in its own way, so ordered it that Gines de Pasamonte, the famous knave and thief who by the virtue and madness of Don Quixote had been released from the chain, driven by fear of the Holy Brotherhood, which he had good reason to dread, resolved to take hiding in the mountains; and his fate and fear led him to the same spot to which Don Quixote and Sancho Panza had been led by theirs, just in time to recognise them and leave them to fall asleep: and as the wicked are always ungrateful, and necessity leads to evildoing, and immediate advantage overcomes all considerations of the future, Gines, who was neither grateful nor well-principled, made up his mind to steal Sancho Panza’s ass, not troubling himself about Rocinante, as being a prize that was no good either to pledge or sell. While Sancho slept he stole his ass, and before day dawned he was far out of reach.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Aurora made her appearance bringing gladness to the earth but sadness to Sancho Panza, for he found that his Dapple was missing, and seeing himself bereft of him he began the saddest and most doleful lament in the world, so loud that Don Quixote awoke at his exclamations and heard him saying, “O son of my bowels, born in my very house, my children’s plaything, my wife’s joy, the envy of my neighbours, relief of my burdens, and lastly, half supporter of myself, for with the six-and-twenty maravedis thou didst earn me daily I met half my charges.”</p> 
<p>Don Quixote, when he heard the lament and learned the cause, consoled Sancho with the best arguments he could, entreating him to be patient, and promising to give him a letter of exchange ordering three out of five ass-colts that he had at home to be given to him. Sancho took comfort at this, dried his tears, suppressed his sobs, and returned thanks for the kindness shown him by Don Quixote. He on his part was rejoiced to the heart on entering the mountains, as they seemed to him to be just the place for the adventures he was in quest of. They brought back to his memory the marvellous adventures that had befallen knights-errant in like solitudes and wilds, and he went along reflecting on these things, so absorbed and carried away by them that he had no thought for anything else.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nor had Sancho any other care (now that he fancied he was travelling in a safe quarter) than to satisfy his appetite with such remains as were left of the clerical spoils, and so he marched behind his master laden with what Dapple used to carry, emptying the sack and packing his paunch, and so long as he could go that way, he would not have given a farthing to meet with another adventure.</p> 
<p>While so engaged he raised his eyes and saw that his master had halted, and was trying with the point of his pike to lift some bulky object that lay upon the ground, on which he hastened to join him and help him if it were needful, and reached him just as with the point of the pike he was raising a saddle-pad with a valise attached to it, half or rather wholly rotten and torn; but so heavy were they that Sancho had to help to take them up, and his master directed him to see what the valise contained. Sancho did so with great alacrity, and though the valise was secured by a chain and padlock, from its torn and rotten condition he was able to see its contents, which were four shirts of fine holland, and other articles of linen no less curious than clean; and in a handkerchief he found a good lot of gold crowns, and as soon as he saw them he exclaimed:</p> 
<p>“Blessed be all Heaven for sending us an adventure that is good for something!”</p> 
<p>Searching further he found a little memorandum book richly bound; this Don Quixote asked of him, telling him to take the money and keep it for himself. Sancho kissed his hands for the favour, and cleared the valise of its linen, which he stowed away in the provision sack. Considering the whole matter, Don Quixote observed:</p> 
<p>“It seems to me, Sancho — and it is impossible it can be otherwise — that some strayed traveller must have crossed this sierra and been attacked and slain by footpads, who brought him to this remote spot to bury him.”</p> 
<p>“That cannot be,” answered Sancho, “because if they had been robbers they would not have left this money.”</p> 
<p>“Thou art right,” said Don Quixote, “and I cannot guess or explain what this may mean; but stay; let us see if in this memorandum book there is anything written by which we may be able to trace out or discover what we want to know.”</p> 
<p>He opened it, and the first thing he found in it, written roughly but in a very good hand, was a sonnet, and reading it aloud that Sancho might hear it, he found that it ran as follows:</p>  
<p>Or to the height of cruelty attains,</p> 
<p>Or else it is my doom to suffer pains</p> 
<p>Beyond the measure due to my offence.</p> 
<p>But if Love be a God, it follows thence</p> 
<p>That he knows all, and certain it remains</p> 
<p>No God loves cruelty; then who ordains</p> 
<p>This penance that enthrals while it torments?</p> 
<p>It were a falsehood, Chloe, thee to name;</p> 
<p>Such evil with such goodness cannot live;</p> 
<p>And against Heaven I dare not charge the blame,</p> 
<p>I only know it is my fate to die.</p> 
<p>To him who knows not whence his malady</p> 
<p>A miracle alone a cure can give.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“There is nothing to be learned from that rhyme,” said Sancho, “unless by that clue there’s in it, one may draw out the ball of the whole matter.”</p> 
<p>“What clue is there?” said Don Quixote.</p> 
<p>“I thought your worship spoke of a clue in it,” said Sancho.</p> 
<p>“I only said Chloe,” replied Don Quixote; “and that no doubt, is the name of the lady of whom the author of the sonnet complains; and, faith, he must be a tolerable poet, or I know little of the craft.”</p> 
<p>“Then your worship understands rhyming too?”</p> 
<p>“And better than thou thinkest,” replied Don Quixote, “as thou shalt see when thou carriest a letter written in verse from beginning to end to my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, for I would have thee know, Sancho, that all or most of the knights-errant in days of yore were great troubadours and great musicians, for both of these accomplishments, or more properly speaking gifts, are the peculiar property of lovers-errant: true it is that the verses of the knights of old have more spirit than neatness in them.”</p> 
<p>“Read more, your worship,” said Sancho, “and you will find something that will enlighten us.”</p> 
<p>Don Quixote turned the page and said, “This is prose and seems to be a letter.”</p> 
<p>“A correspondence letter, senor?”</p> 
<p>“From the beginning it seems to be a love letter,” replied Don Quixote.</p> 
<p>“Then let your worship read it aloud,” said Sancho, “for I am very fond of love matters.”</p> 
<p>“With all my heart,” said Don Quixote, and reading it aloud as Sancho had requested him, he found it ran thus:</p> 
<p>Thy false promise and my sure misforutne carry me to a place whence the news of my death will reach thy ears before the words of my complaint. Ungrateful one, thou hast rejected me for one more wealthy, but not more worthy; but if virtue were esteemed wealth I should neither envy the fortunes of others nor weep for misfortunes of my own. What thy beauty raised up thy deeds have laid low; by it I believed thee to be an angel, by them I know thou art a woman. Peace be with thee who hast sent war to me, and Heaven grant that the deceit of thy husband be ever hidden from thee, so that thou repent not of what thou hast done, and I reap not a revenge I would not have.</p> 
<p>When he had finished the letter, Don Quixote said, “There is less to be gathered from this than from the verses, except that he who wrote it is some rejected lover;” and turning over nearly all the pages of the book he found more verses and letters, some of which he could read, while others he could not; but they were all made up of complaints, laments, misgivings, desires and aversions, favours and rejections, some rapturous, some doleful. While Don Quixote examined the book, Sancho examined the valise, not leaving a corner in the whole of it or in the pad that he did not search, peer into, and explore, or seam that he did not rip, or tuft of wool that he did not pick to pieces, lest anything should escape for want of care and pains; so keen was the covetousness excited in him by the discovery of the crowns, which amounted to near a hundred; and though he found no more booty, he held the blanket flights, balsam vomits, stake benedictions, carriers’ fisticuffs, missing alforjas, stolen coat, and all the hunger, thirst, and weariness he had endured in the service of his good master, cheap at the price; as he considered himself more than fully indemnified for all by the payment he received in the gift of the treasure-trove.</p> 
<p>The Knight of the Rueful Countenance was still very anxious to find out who the owner of the valise could be, conjecturing from the sonnet and letter, from the money in gold, and from the fineness of the shirts, that he must be some lover of distinction whom the scorn and cruelty of his lady had driven to some desperate course; but as in that uninhabited and rugged spot there was no one to be seen of whom he could inquire, he saw nothing else for it but to push on, taking whatever road Rocinante chose — which was where he could make his way — firmly persuaded that among these wilds he could not fail to meet some rare adventure. As he went along, then, occupied with these thoughts, he perceived on the summit of a height that rose before their eyes a man who went springing from rock to rock and from tussock to tussock with marvellous agility. As well as he could make out he was unclad, with a thick black beard, long tangled hair, and bare legs and feet, his thighs were covered by breeches apparently of tawny velvet but so ragged that they showed his skin in several places.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He was bareheaded, and notwithstanding the swiftness with which he passed as has been described, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance observed and noted all these trifles, and though he made the attempt, he was unable to follow him, for it was not granted to the feebleness of Rocinante to make way over such rough ground, he being, moreover, slow-paced and sluggish by nature. Don Quixote at once came to the conclusion that this was the owner of the saddle-pad and of the valise, and made up his mind to go in search of him, even though he should have to wander a year in those mountains before he found him, and so he directed Sancho to take a short cut over one side of the mountain, while he himself went by the other, and perhaps by this means they might light upon this man who had passed so quickly out of their sight.</p> 
<p>“I could not do that,” said Sancho, “for when I separate from your worship fear at once lays hold of me, and assails me with all sorts of panics and fancies; and let what I now say be a notice that from this time forth I am not going to stir a finger’s width from your presence.”</p> 
<p>“It shall be so,” said he of the Rueful Countenance, “and I am very glad that thou art willing to rely on my courage, which will never fail thee, even though the soul in thy body fail thee; so come on now behind me slowly as well as thou canst, and make lanterns of thine eyes; let us make the circuit of this ridge; perhaps we shall light upon this man that we saw, who no doubt is no other than the owner of what we found.”</p> 
<p>To which Sancho made answer, “Far better would it be not to look for him, for, if we find him, and he happens to be the owner of the money, it is plain I must restore it; it would be better, therefore, that without taking this needless trouble, I should keep possession of it until in some other less meddlesome and officious way the real owner may be discovered; and perhaps that will be when I shall have spent it, and then the king will hold me harmless.”</p> 
<p>“Thou art wrong there, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “for now that we have a suspicion who the owner is, and have him almost before us, we are bound to seek him and make restitution; and if we do not see him, the strong suspicion we have as to his being the owner makes us as guilty as if he were so; and so, friend Sancho, let not our search for him give thee any uneasiness, for if we find him it will relieve mine.”</p> 
<p>And so saying he gave Rocinante the spur, and Sancho followed him on foot and loaded, and after having partly made the circuit of the mountain they found lying in a ravine, dead and half devoured by dogs and pecked by jackdaws, a mule saddled and bridled, all which still further strengthened their suspicion that he who had fled was the owner of the mule and the saddle-pad.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As they stood looking at it they heard a whistle like that of a shepherd watching his flock, and suddenly on their left there appeared a great number of goats and behind them on the summit of the mountain the goatherd in charge of them, a man advanced in years. Don Quixote called aloud to him and begged him to come down to where they stood. He shouted in return, asking what had brought them to that spot, seldom or never trodden except by the feet of goats, or of the wolves and other wild beasts that roamed around. Sancho in return bade him come down, and they would explain all to him.</p> 
<p>The goatherd descended, and reaching the place where Don Quixote stood, he said, “I will wager you are looking at that hack mule that lies dead in the hollow there, and, faith, it has been lying there now these six months; tell me, have you come upon its master about here?”</p> 
<p>“We have come upon nobody,” answered Don Quixote, “nor on anything except a saddle-pad and a little valise that we found not far from this.”</p> 
<p>“I found it too,” said the goatherd, “but I would not lift it nor go near it for fear of some ill-luck or being charged with theft, for the devil is crafty, and things rise up under one’s feet to make one fall without knowing why or wherefore.”</p> 
<p>“That’s exactly what I say,” said Sancho; “I found it too, and I would not go within a stone’s throw of it; there I left it, and there it lies just as it was, for I don’t want a dog with a bell.”</p> 
<p>“Tell me, good man,” said Don Quixote, “do you know who is the owner of this property?”</p> 
<p>“All I can tell you,” said the goatherd, “is that about six months ago, more or less, there arrived at a shepherd’s hut three leagues, perhaps, away from this, a youth of well-bred appearance and manners, mounted on that same mule which lies dead here, and with the same saddle-pad and valise which you say you found and did not touch. He asked us what part of this sierra was the most rugged and retired; we told him that it was where we now are; and so in truth it is, for if you push on half a league farther, perhaps you will not be able to find your way out; and I am wondering how you have managed to come here, for there is no road or path that leads to this spot. I say, then, that on hearing our answer the youth turned about and made for the place we pointed out to him, leaving us all charmed with his good looks, and wondering at his question and the haste with which we saw him depart in the direction of the sierra; and after that we saw him no more, until some days afterwards he crossed the path of one of our shepherds, and without saying a word to him, came up to him and gave him several cuffs and kicks, and then turned to the ass with our provisions and took all the bread and cheese it carried, and having done this made off back again into the sierra with extraordinary swiftness. When some of us goatherds learned this we went in search of him for about two days through the most remote portion of this sierra, at the end of which we found him lodged in the hollow of a large thick cork tree. He came out to meet us with great gentleness, with his dress now torn and his face so disfigured and burned by the sun, that we hardly recognised him but that his clothes, though torn, convinced us, from the recollection we had of them, that he was the person we were looking for. He saluted us courteously, and in a few well-spoken words he told us not to wonder at seeing him going about in this guise, as it was binding upon him in order that he might work out a penance which for his many sins had been imposed upon him. We asked him to tell us who he was, but we were never able to find out from him: we begged of him too, when he was in want of food, which he could not do without, to tell us where we should find him, as we would bring it to him with all good-will and readiness; or if this were not to his taste, at least to come and ask it of us and not take it by force from the shepherds. He thanked us for the offer, begged pardon for the late assault, and promised for the future to ask it in God’s name without offering violence to anybody. As for fixed abode, he said he had no other than that which chance offered wherever night might overtake him; and his words ended in an outburst of weeping so bitter that we who listened to him must have been very stones had we not joined him in it, comparing what we saw of him the first time with what we saw now; for, as I said, he was a graceful and gracious youth, and in his courteous and polished language showed himself to be of good birth and courtly breeding, and rustics as we were that listened to him, even to our rusticity his gentle bearing sufficed to make it plain.</p> 
<p>“But in the midst of his conversation he stopped and became silent, keeping his eyes fixed upon the ground for some time, during which we stood still waiting anxiously to see what would come of this abstraction; and with no little pity, for from his behaviour, now staring at the ground with fixed gaze and eyes wide open without moving an eyelid, again closing them, compressing his lips and raising his eyebrows, we could perceive plainly that a fit of madness of some kind had come upon him; and before long he showed that what we imagined was the truth, for he arose in a fury from the ground where he had thrown himself, and attacked the first he found near him with such rage and fierceness that if we had not dragged him off him, he would have beaten or bitten him to death, all the while exclaiming, ‘Oh faithless Fernando, here, here shalt thou pay the penalty of the wrong thou hast done me; these hands shall tear out that heart of thine, abode and dwelling of all iniquity, but of deceit and fraud above all; and to these he added other words all in effect upbraiding this Fernando and charging him with treachery and faithlessness.</p> 
<p>“We forced him to release his hold with no little difficulty, and without another word he left us, and rushing off plunged in among these brakes and brambles, so as to make it impossible for us to follow him; from this we suppose that madness comes upon him from time to time, and that some one called Fernando must have done him a wrong of a grievous nature such as the condition to which it had brought him seemed to show. All this has been since then confirmed on those occasions, and they have been many, on which he has crossed our path, at one time to beg the shepherds to give him some of the food they carry, at another to take it from them by force; for when there is a fit of madness upon him, even though the shepherds offer it freely, he will not accept it but snatches it from them by dint of blows; but when he is in his senses he begs it for the love of God, courteously and civilly, and receives it with many thanks and not a few tears. And to tell you the truth, sirs,” continued the goatherd, “it was yesterday that we resolved, I and four of the lads, two of them our servants, and the other two friends of mine, to go in search of him until we find him, and when we do to take him, whether by force or of his own consent, to the town of Almodovar, which is eight leagues from this, and there strive to cure him (if indeed his malady admits of a cure), or learn when he is in his senses who he is, and if he has relatives to whom we may give notice of his misfortune. This, sirs, is all I can say in answer to what you have asked me; and be sure that the owner of the articles you found is he whom you saw pass by with such nimbleness and so naked.”</p> 
<p>For Don Quixote had already described how he had seen the man go bounding along the mountain side, and he was now filled with amazement at what he heard from the goatherd, and more eager than ever to discover who the unhappy madman was; and in his heart he resolved, as he had done before, to search for him all over the mountain, not leaving a corner or cave unexamined until he had found him. But chance arranged matters better than he expected or hoped, for at that very moment, in a gorge on the mountain that opened where they stood, the youth he wished to find made his appearance, coming along talking to himself in a way that would have been unintelligible near at hand, much more at a distance. His garb was what has been described, save that as he drew near, Don Quixote perceived that a tattered doublet which he wore was amber-tanned, from which he concluded that one who wore such garments could not be of very low rank.</p> 
<p>Approaching them, the youth greeted them in a harsh and hoarse voice but with great courtesy. Don Quixote returned his salutation with equal politeness, and dismounting from Rocinante advanced with well-bred bearing and grace to embrace him, and held him for some time close in his arms as if he had known him for a long time. The other, whom we may call the Ragged One of the Sorry Countenance, as Don Quixote was of the Rueful, after submitting to the embrace pushed him back a little and, placing his hands on Don Quixote’s shoulders, stood gazing at him as if seeking to see whether he knew him, not less amazed, perhaps, at the sight of the face, figure, and armour of Don Quixote than Don Quixote was at the sight of him. To be brief, the first to speak after embracing was the Ragged One, and he said what will be told farther on.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>看到自己的狼狈样，唐吉诃德对桑乔说：</p> 
<p>“桑乔，我一直听说，‘善待无赖等于向海里泼水’。如果我早听你的，就不会有这场乱子了。不过事情已经做了，别着急，从现在起，引以为戒。”</p> 
<p>“您若真能引以为戒，我也就能变成突厥人了。”桑乔说，“不过既然您说了，如果当初听我的话，就不会吃这个亏，那么现在请您相信我的话吧，以免吃更大的亏。我告诉您，用骑士那套做法对付圣友团可行不通。在他们眼里，游侠骑士一钱不值。您知道吗，我觉得现在仿佛就能听到他们的箭在我耳边嗡嗡作响呢①。”</p> 
<p>“你天生是个胆小鬼，桑乔。”唐吉诃德说，“为了不让你说我这个人顽固不化，从来不听你的劝告，我想这次就听你这一回，躲开这帮让你如此恐惧的复仇分子。不过得有个条件，那就是不管我生前还是死后，都不许对任何人说我这次害怕了，只能说我是应你的请求，才在危险面前退却的。假如你说了别的，就是说谎。从现在到那时，从那时回到现在，我都会否认。每当你想说出来或者已经说出来的时候，我都会说你在说谎，而且还会再说谎。你别再说什么了。只要你想到我是由于恐惧作祟，才在某个危险、特别是这个危险面前退却，我就不准备走了，要一个人留在这里，不仅等着你说你害怕的那个圣友团，还要等着以色列十二部落兄弟，等着七个马加比②，等着卡斯托尔和波卢克斯③，以及世界上所有的兄弟姐妹们。”</p> 
<p>①圣友团通常将罪犯用箭射死，然后陈尸荒野。</p> 
<p>②公元前2世纪统治巴勒斯坦的犹太祭司哈斯蒙尼家族的马塔蒂亚及其儿子，因骁勇善战，得绰号“马加比”，意为“锤子”。</p> 
<p>③希腊神话里宙斯的孪生子，又合称狄奥斯库里，意为“宙斯的儿子们”。</p> 
<p>“大人，”桑乔说，“退却不等于逃跑，等着也不算聪明。如果危险超过了希望，明智的办法就是养精蓄锐，而不是孤注一掷。您应该知道，我虽然是个粗人，可是还能做到人们所说的克制。您如果听我的劝告，就不会后悔，那就是如果身体还行，您就骑上罗西南多，如果不行，让我来扶您上，然后跟我走。我的头脑告诉我，现在咱们最需要的不是动手，而是动腿。”</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德不再多说，桑乔牵着他的驴，两人从旁边的一个山口走进莫雷纳山脉。桑乔想越过山脉，到维索或坎普的阿尔莫多瓦尔去，在穷山僻壤待几天，圣友团就是找他们也找不到。他再一看，同苦役犯们厮打时被抢走了不少东西，可是驮在驴背上的食物居然保存了下来，桑乔更振奋了，觉得这是个奇迹。</p> 
<p>那天晚上，两人来到莫雷纳山脉深处。桑乔想在那儿过夜，然后再待几天，至少他们带的食物能维持多久就待多久。于是，两人在栓皮槠树林里的两块石头之间安歇下来。可是，就像某些从来没有真正信仰的人认为的那样，厄运总是如期而至。由于唐吉诃德的好心和糊涂而挣脱了锁链的著名骗子、盗贼希内斯·帕萨蒙特，出于对圣友团的恐惧，他当然有理由感到恐惧，也想在莫雷纳山脉藏身，而且居然鬼使神差地跑到了唐吉诃德和桑乔安歇的那个地方。希内斯立刻就认出了这两个人，不过没有惊动他们。两人依然睡着。坏人总是忘恩负义，不免干些不该干的事，而且为了眼前的利益放弃将来的利益。希内斯不知恩图报，反而居心不良，竟决定偷走桑乔的驴。不过，他没有动罗西南多，因为知道无论是典当还是出卖它，都得不到好价钱。桑乔睡觉的时候，希内斯偷走了他的驴，在天亮之前就逃之夭夭，无论如何也追赶不上了。</p> 
<p>曙光初照，给大地带来了欢乐，却给桑乔带来了悲伤。他看到自己的驴不见了，十分伤心地哭了起来。唐吉诃德被他的哭声惊醒了，听见他在说：</p> 
<p>“我的心肝宝贝呀，你生在我家，是孩子们的宠物，是我老婆的欢欣，连邻居们都嫉妒我。你减轻了我的负担，供养了我的一半生活，你每天挣的二十六个马拉维迪，完全可以支付我的一半伙食！”</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德见桑乔大哭不止，问清缘由后，极力好言相劝，叫他别着急，还答应给他立下一张凭据，把自己家里的五头驴送给桑乔三头。</p> 
<p>桑乔这才放下心来。他揩干眼泪，哭腔也没那么厉害了，感谢唐吉诃德给他的恩赐。唐吉诃德自从进了山，心情愉快，觉得这正是他寻险的理想之地。他又想起了游侠骑士在荒山野岭的种种奇遇，完全沉醉了，脑子里根本没有其他东西。桑乔到了自以为安全的地方后，也心中释然，用教士们剩下的那些残羹剩饭大饱口福。他背着那些本来是驴驮的东西，跟在主人后面，不时从口袋里掏出食物，狼吞虎咽地塞进肚子。</p> 
<p>他宁愿这样，不想再寻求什么冒险了。</p> 
<p>桑乔抬起头，看到唐吉诃德止住了脚步，试图用长矛把路上的一包东西挑起来。他赶紧过去帮忙。赶到跟前时，唐吉诃德正好用长矛挑起一个坐垫，上面系着一个手提箱。手提箱已经烂得差不多了，或者说全烂了，不过还挺沉，桑乔只好用手去拿。唐吉诃德让他看看手提箱里装的是什么东西。桑乔赶紧看了看。虽然手提箱上有条锁链，还有一把锁，可是从箱子破漏的地方能看到里面。原来是四件荷兰细麻布衬衣，还有其它一些麻布织品，都挺干净。一块手绢里有不少金盾。桑乔一看见金盾就说：</p> 
<p>“老天有眼，给我们带来了外快！”</p> 
<p>桑乔继续翻看，发现有个装帧精美的备忘记事本。唐吉诃德要了笔记本，让桑乔自己把钱留下。桑乔见主人如此慷慨大方，吻了唐吉诃德的手，然后把箱子里的东西掏出来，放进干粮袋里。唐吉诃德见状说：</p> 
<p>“桑乔，我觉得可能是某个迷路的人途经此地，遭到了歹徒袭击。大概歹徒已经把他杀了，然后转移到如此闭塞的地方埋了。”</p> 
<p>“不可能，”桑乔说，“如果是强盗，这钱就不会剩下了。”</p> 
<p>“你说得对。”唐吉诃德说，“既然这样，我就猜不出到底是怎么回事了。等一等，咱们看看笔记本上记着什么，看能不能找出咱们需要的东西。”</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德打开笔记本，看见上面写着一首诗，虽然是草稿，可字体写得很漂亮。他高声念起来，让桑乔也听听。诗是这样写的：</p> 
<p>或许爱情无知，</p> 
<p>或许爱情残酷，</p> 
<p>想来我不该</p> 
<p>屈受此痛苦。</p> 
<p>爱情若是神，</p> 
<p>学当五车富，</p> 
<p>残酷不应有，</p> 
<p>是谁使我受此苦？</p> 
<p>若说是你，菲丽，</p> 
<p>那是我的谬误。</p> 
<p>罪恶善良不相容，</p> 
<p>横祸绝非天上出。</p> 
<p>唯有我将逝，</p> 
<p>有目皆共睹。</p> 
<p>苦因尚不明，</p> 
<p>回天亦无术。</p> 
<p>“仅凭这首诗，什么也看不出，”桑乔说，“除非先理出个头绪来。”</p> 
<p>“这里有什么头绪？”唐吉诃德问。</p> 
<p>“大概，”桑乔说，“就是您刚才说的那个头绪吧。”</p> 
<p>“我刚才只说了‘菲丽’，”唐吉诃德说，“这肯定是诗作者抱怨的那位贵妇人的名字。看来她是一位理智的诗人，或许我对诗懂得不多。”</p> 
<p>“您也懂得诗？”桑乔问。</p> 
<p>“懂得比你想象的多，”唐吉诃德说，“以后你给托博索的杜尔西内亚夫人带信的时候就会看到，通篇都是用诗写的。我该让你知道了，桑乔，上个世纪所有或者大部分游侠骑士都是伟大的诗人和伟大的音乐家。更确切地说，这两种才能或天赋是多情的游侠骑士的必备条件。不过，以前骑士的诗更注重情感，而不是辞藻。”</p> 
<p>“您再念点儿，”桑乔说，“也许能找到些有用的东西。”</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德又翻了一页，说道：</p> 
<p>“这是散文，像是一封信。”</p> 
<p>“是信函吗，大人？”桑乔问。</p> 
<p>“开头倒像是情书。”唐吉诃德说。</p> 
<p>“那么您大点声念，”桑乔说，“我对这些谈情说爱的事情挺感兴趣。”</p> 
<p>“好吧。”唐吉诃德说。</p> 
<p>既然桑乔求他，他就高声念起来。信是这样写的：</p> 
<p>你虚假的诺言和我切实的不幸让我来到了这个地</p> 
<p>方。你首先听到的将是我的死讯，然后才是我的抱怨。负心人，你为了比我富有但是并不比我更有价值的人而抛弃了我。可是，品德比财富更重要。我不会对别人的幸运嫉妒，也不会为自己的不幸哭泣。你的美貌造就的东西又被你的行为摧毁了。凭你的美貌，我把你看成天使；</p> 
<p>凭你的行为，你不过是个女人。是你造成了悲剧。放心吧，但愿老天让你丈夫对你的欺骗永远不被揭露，你不必为你的行为后悔，我也不会为我并不喜欢的东西而去报复。</p> 
<p>念完信，唐吉诃德说：</p> 
<p>“那首诗比这封信上说的东西还要多。看得出，这是个被抛弃的情人。”</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德差不多翻遍了整个本子，又看到一些诗和信件。有的能看清，有的看不懂，里面无非都是些抱怨和怀疑，有奉承和鄙夷，有信誓旦旦，也有哭哭啼啼。有的有趣，有的乏味。唐吉诃德翻看笔记本，桑乔则忙着翻手提箱，连箱角和坐垫也不放过，又查又找，每一道缝都扒开看，每一根线都捋一捋，无一疏漏，结果找到的金盾竟达一百多个，桑乔兴奋得不得了。虽然没有再找到其他东西，他还是觉得以前被人用被单扔，被圣水灌得直呕吐，以及棍棒的教训，脚夫的拳头，褡裢和外套的丢失，跟随主人忍饥挨渴受累，都不冤枉了。他认为所有这些都已由金盾作了极好的补偿。</p> 
<p>猥獕骑士特别想知道谁是手提箱的主人。从那些诗和信、金盾和高级衬衣来看，唐吉诃德估计一定是位有身份的恋人，由于受到他那位贵妇人的抛弃和冷遇而寻了短见。可是，在那个渺无人烟、道路崎岖的地方，没有人能够证实这一点，唐吉诃德也只好任凭罗西南多随意择路而行，脑子里仍一直想着，在这荆棘丛生之地一定会遇到险情。</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德边想边走，忽然看见前面一个山头上有个人在岩石杂草中极其轻盈地跳跃而行。那人似乎赤身裸体，胡子又黑又密，头发也乱蓬蓬，脚上没穿鞋，小腿也光着，大腿部穿条短裤，好像是棕黄色丝绒，可是也已经破破烂烂，很多地方都露出肉来，头上什么也没戴。虽然那人跳跃得很轻盈，可这些细节都被猥獕骑士看在眼里。他想追赶却追不上，因为罗西南多不习惯走这种崎岖山路，而且步子小，行动迟缓。唐吉诃德估计坐垫和手提箱就是那个人的，想去追他，即使追一年，也一定要追上他。唐吉诃德让桑乔在山的一侧堵截那人，自己从山的另一侧过去，也许这样能找到那个在他们眼前转瞬消失的人。</p> 
<p>“我不能去，”桑乔说，“我只要离开您就害怕，觉得危机四伏。我告诉您，从现在起，我要一直守在您身边，寸步不离。”</p> 
<p>“那也好，”唐吉诃德说，“我很高兴你愿意得到我的勇气的保护。哪怕你身体的灵魂没有了，这种勇气也会保护你。你现在跟着我慢慢走，尽可能把你的眼睛睁大些。咱们绕过这座小山，也许就会碰到刚才看见的那个人。咱们捡到的那些东西肯定是他的。”</p> 
<p>桑乔答道：</p> 
<p>“最好还是别找了。假如咱们找到了他，而且钱也是他的，当然就得把钱还给他。所以，最好别瞎费那个劲。让我把钱好好保存着，等以后钱的真正主人以其它不那么神秘的方式出现。或许那时候钱也花完了，国王就会宽恕我。”</p> 
<p>“你这是自欺欺人，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“咱们已经猜出钱的主人是谁，而且几乎近在眼前，就有义务找到他，把钱还给他。如果咱们不找到他，咱们的这种猜测就足以让咱们内疚了，仿佛咱们真办了错事似的。所以，桑乔朋友，你别为找他而难过。如果找到他，我就不难过了。”</p> 
<p>于是，唐吉诃德用脚夹了一下罗西南多，桑乔背着东西步行跟在后面，这全是希内斯·帕萨蒙特办的好事。他们绕着山跑了一阵，在一条小溪里发现了一匹鞍辔俱全、已倒地而死的骡子。骡子已经被野狗和乌鸦吃了一半。这些都证实了他们的怀疑：刚才跑的那个人就是骡子和坐垫的主人。</p> 
<p>他们正看着，忽然听见一声像是牧羊人放羊的口哨声，接着左侧出现了一大片羊群。羊群后面，在一座山的山顶上，出现了一位牧羊老人。唐吉诃德高声喊叫，请老人下到他们待的地方来。老人则高声问，是谁把他们带到这个地方来的。除了羊、狼和附近的其它野兽外，很少或者根本没有人来到这个地方。桑乔让他下来，再跟他细说。老人下了山，来到唐吉诃德身边，说：</p> 
<p>“我打赌，你们正在看地上那匹死骡子。它倒在那儿已经六个月了。告诉我，你们碰到它的主人了吗？”</p> 
<p>“我们谁也没碰到，”唐吉诃德说，“只是在离这儿不远的地方发现了一只坐垫和一个手提箱。”</p> 
<p>“我也发现了，”羊倌说，“不过我没有去拿它，也没有到它跟前去，怕那是什么祸害，或者让别人以为我做贼，再来跟我算帐。魔鬼很狡猾，人走过去，脚下的东西就会飞起来，稀里糊涂地就把人掀倒了。”</p> 
<p>“我也这样说。”桑乔说，“我看见了它，可是连块石头都懒得扔过去。东西仍然原封不动地放在那儿，我并不想招惹是非。”</p> 
<p>“请告诉我，善良的人，”唐吉诃德说，“你知道这些东西是谁的吗？”</p> 
<p>“我可以告诉你的就是，大约六个月以前，”牧羊人说，“有个英俊潇洒的小伙子来到牧羊人住的棚子里，那个棚子离这儿有三西里远。他骑的就是那匹现在已经死了的骡子，带的就是你们见过却没有动过的坐垫和手提箱。他问我们，这山上什么地方最险峻、最隐秘。我们告诉他，就是咱们现在待的这个地方。这是真的。假如你再往前走半西里路，恐怕就没路走了。我感到惊奇，不知你们怎么能够来到这个地方。没有一条路通向这里。总之，那个小伙子听到我们的回答后，掉转骡子，向我们给他指的地方走去。我们喜欢他那样子，可是对他的要求感到奇怪，对他来去匆匆也感到奇怪。此后就一直没见到他。过了几天，他在路上碰到我们当中的一位牧羊人，二话不说，上前就对牧人又打又踢，接着又向驮干粮的驴奔去，把所有的面包和奶酪都抢走了。然后，他又极其敏捷地藏进山里。我们几个牧羊人听说后，找了两天，连山上最荒僻的地方都找了，最后才在一棵又粗又挺拔的栓皮槠的树洞里找到他。</p> 
<p>“他出来迎接我们时，态度很和气。他的衣服已经破了，脸被太阳晒得已经扭曲，我们几乎认不出他了。不过凭他身上的衣服，虽然破了，我们还是认出他就是我们要找的那个人。他彬彬有礼地问候我们，然后有条有理简单地告诉我们，不要为看到他这个样子而感到奇怪。只有这样，才能对过去的许多错误进行忏悔。我们请他告诉我们他的名字，可他最终也没有说。我们还要求他，需要食品的时候，可以告诉我们在哪儿能找到他，我们会非常友好、非常认真地给他送去，人没有食品没法活。如果他不愿意给他送，他也可以出来要，而不用向牧羊人抢。</p> 
<p>“他对我们的帮助表示感谢，并且请求原谅他前几次的行抢。看在上帝份上，需要食品的时候，他会出来要，不会再对任何人非礼了。至于他的住所，他说只有那个睡觉的地方。说到最后，他竟轻声哭了起来，哭得那么动情，除非我们是石头做的，否则一想到我们初次看到他时的样子，以及现在这个样子，我们也为之落泪。我刚才说过，他本是个英俊潇洒的小伙子，从他的礼貌和得体的言谈中，可以断定他是个出身高贵的有教养的人。我们虽然是些粗人，可就是再粗的人，听他这么讲话，也知道他是位贵人。大家正说到兴头上，他忽然顿住了，沉默不语，两眼盯着地，一直盯了很长时间。我们都愣住了，不无怜悯地等着，想知道他为什么发呆。他睁着眼睛，一直盯着地，连眼皮也不眨一下，过一会儿闭上了眼睛，可是又咬紧牙关，眉头紧蹙。我们很容易就知道他一定受过什么刺激。</p> 
<p>“他很快就证实了我们的猜测。他本来躺在地上，突然怒气冲天地从地上跳起来，疯狂地向他身边的一个人冲去。要不是我们把他拉开，他会把那人连打带咬地弄死。他一边发疯一边喊：‘哎，你这狼心狗肺的费尔南多，我要跟你算帐！我这双手要掏出你的心，你的心集万恶之大成，尤其是对我背信弃义！’</p> 
<p>“他还说了些其他的话，都是骂费尔南多的，说他狡诈欺骗。我们把他拉开了，心里都很难过。他不再说什么，离开我们，跑进乱草丛中藏了起来，我们根本找不到他。我们猜想他犯病是有规律的，可能有个叫费尔南多的人做了什么对不起他的事，而且把他坑害得不轻，才把他弄成这个样子。后来我们又多次发现，他出来时，有时向牧人们要他们随身带的食物，有时就硬抢。他犯病的时候，即使牧人们诚心诚意地给他吃的，他也不好好拿着，非得打人家几拳才行。可是他神态正常时，就会谦恭有礼地说‘看在上帝份上’之类的话，并且千谢万谢，还常常感激涕零。</p> 
<p>“说实话，大人，”牧人接着说，“我和四个人，其中两个人是伙计，两个是朋友，决定一起去找他，等找到他，不管他愿意不愿意，定要把他送到八西里之外的阿尔莫达瓦尔镇去。如果病能治，就给他治病，或者趁他明白的时候，问他叫什么，是否有什么亲戚，去报个信。两位大人，你们问的事情，我知道的就这些。还有，你们捡到的那些东西就是他的，他就是你们看见的那个赤身裸体、健步如飞的人（因为唐吉诃德刚才向牧人讲述了那个在山上跳着走的人）。”</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德听了牧人的话后很惊奇，并且更急于知道这位不幸的疯子到底是谁了。他心中暗想，一定要找遍整座山，所有隐蔽之处和山洞都不放过，直到找到他为止。真可谓天助人也，就在这个时候，他们要找的那个小伙子从一个山口向他们走过来，嘴里还嘟囔着什么，即使在近处都听不清，就更别提从远处了。他的衣服仿佛是花色的。可是等他走近了，唐吉诃德才看清，他穿的破烂皮坎肩是用龙涎香鞣制的。可以断定，穿着这种衣服的人身份不会低。</p> 
<p>小伙子走近他们，向他们问好，声音虽然嘶哑，却很有礼貌。唐吉诃德同样很客气地向他问好，并且下了马，文雅潇洒地同他拥抱，而且拥抱了好一会儿，仿佛见到了一位久违的朋友。我们称唐吉诃德为猥獕骑士，那个小伙子，我们就暂且称他“褴褛汉”吧，他也同唐吉诃德拥抱，随后把唐吉诃德向后推开一点儿，双手放在他肩上，端详着他，仿佛看是否认识他。看到唐吉诃德这副样子和打扮，他感到惊奇，就像唐吉诃德初见他时也惊奇一样。拥抱过后，褴褛汉首先开口，说了下面一席话。</p>
