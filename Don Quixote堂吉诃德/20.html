<p>“Thou art very right, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “but to tell the truth, it had escaped my memory; and likewise thou mayest rely upon it that the affair of the blanket happened to thee because of thy fault in not reminding me of it in time; but I will make amends, for there are ways of compounding for everything in the order of chivalry.”</p> 
<p>“Why! have I taken an oath of some sort, then?” said Sancho.</p> 
<p>“It makes no matter that thou hast not taken an oath,” said Don Quixote; “suffice it that I see thou art not quite clear of complicity; and whether or no, it will not be ill done to provide ourselves with a remedy.”</p> 
<p>“In that case,” said Sancho, “mind that your worship does not forget this as you did the oath; perhaps the phantoms may take it into their heads to amuse themselves once more with me; or even with your worship if they see you so obstinate.”</p> 
<p>While engaged in this and other talk, night overtook them on the road before they had reached or discovered any place of shelter; and what made it still worse was that they were dying of hunger, for with the loss of the alforjas they had lost their entire larder and commissariat; and to complete the misfortune they met with an adventure which without any invention had really the appearance of one. It so happened that the night closed in somewhat darkly, but for all that they pushed on, Sancho feeling sure that as the road was the king’s highway they might reasonably expect to find some inn within a league or two. Going along, then, in this way, the night dark, the squire hungry, the master sharp-set, they saw coming towards them on the road they were travelling a great number of lights which looked exactly like stars in motion. Sancho was taken aback at the sight of them, nor did Don Quixote altogether relish them: the one pulled up his ass by the halter, the other his hack by the bridle, and they stood still, watching anxiously to see what all this would turn out to be, and found that the lights were approaching them, and the nearer they came the greater they seemed, at which spectacle Sancho began to shake like a man dosed with mercury, and Don Quixote’s hair stood on end; he, however, plucking up spirit a little, said:</p> 
<p>“This, no doubt, Sancho, will be a most mighty and perilous adventure, in which it will be needful for me to put forth all my valour and resolution.”</p> 
<p>“Unlucky me!” answered Sancho; “if this adventure happens to be one of phantoms, as I am beginning to think it is, where shall I find the ribs to bear it?”</p> 
<p>“Be they phantoms ever so much,” said Don Quixote, “I will not permit them to touch a thread of thy garments; for if they played tricks with thee the time before, it was because I was unable to leap the walls of the yard; but now we are on a wide plain, where I shall be able to wield my sword as I please.”</p> 
<p>“And if they enchant and cripple you as they did the last time,” said Sancho, “what difference will it make being on the open plain or not?”</p> 
<p>“For all that,” replied Don Quixote, “I entreat thee, Sancho, to keep a good heart, for experience will tell thee what mine is.”</p> 
<p>“I will, please God,” answered Sancho, and the two retiring to one side of the road set themselves to observe closely what all these moving lights might be; and very soon afterwards they made out some twenty encamisados, all on horseback, with lighted torches in their hands, the awe-inspiring aspect of whom completely extinguished the courage of Sancho, who began to chatter with his teeth like one in the cold fit of an ague; and his heart sank and his teeth chattered still more when they perceived distinctly that behind them there came a litter covered over with black and followed by six more mounted figures in mourning down to the very feet of their mules — for they could perceive plainly they were not horses by the easy pace at which they went. And as the encamisados came along they muttered to themselves in a low plaintive tone. This strange spectacle at such an hour and in such a solitary place was quite enough to strike terror into Sancho’s heart, and even into his master’s ; and (save in Don Quixote’s case) did so, for all Sancho’s resolution had now broken down. It was just the opposite with his master, whose imagination immediately conjured up all this to him vividly as one of the adventures of his books.</p> 
<p>He took it into his head that the litter was a bier on which was borne some sorely wounded or slain knight, to avenge whom was a task reserved for him alone; and without any further reasoning he laid his lance in rest, fixed himself firmly in his saddle, and with gallant spirit and bearing took up his position in the middle of the road where the encamisados must of necessity pass; and as soon as he saw them near at hand he raised his voice and said:</p> 
<p>“Halt, knights, or whosoever ye may be, and render me account of who ye are, whence ye come, where ye go, what it is ye carry upon that bier, for, to judge by appearances, either ye have done some wrong or some wrong has been done to you, and it is fitting and necessary that I should know, either that I may chastise you for the evil ye have done, or else that I may avenge you for the injury that has been inflicted upon you.”</p> 
<p>“We are in haste,” answered one of the encamisados, “and the inn is far off, and we cannot stop to render you such an account as you demand;” and spurring his mule he moved on.</p> 
<p>Don Quixote was mightily provoked by this answer, and seizing the mule by the bridle he said, “Halt, and be more mannerly, and render an account of what I have asked of you; else, take my defiance to combat, all of you.”</p> 
<p>The mule was shy, and was so frightened at her bridle being seized that rearing up she flung her rider to the ground over her haunches. An attendant who was on foot, seeing the encamisado fall, began to abuse Don Quixote, who now moved to anger, without any more ado, laying his lance in rest charged one of the men in mourning and brought him badly wounded to the ground, and as he wheeled round upon the others the agility with which he attacked and routed them was a sight to see, for it seemed just as if wings had that instant grown upon Rocinante, so lightly and proudly did he bear himself. The encamisados were all timid folk and unarmed, so they speedily made their escape from the fray and set off at a run across the plain with their lighted torches, looking exactly like maskers running on some gala or festival night. The mourners, too, enveloped and swathed in their skirts and gowns, were unable to bestir themselves, and so with entire safety to himself Don Quixote belaboured them all and drove them off against their will, for they all thought it was no man but a devil from hell come to carry away the dead body they had in the litter.</p> 
<p>Sancho beheld all this in astonishment at the intrepidity of his lord, and said to himself, “Clearly this master of mine is as bold and valiant as he says he is.”</p> 
<p>A burning torch lay on the ground near the first man whom the mule had thrown, by the light of which Don Quixote perceived him, and coming up to him he presented the point of the lance to his face, calling on him to yield himself prisoner, or else he would kill him; to which the prostrate man replied, “I am prisoner enough as it is; I cannot stir, for one of my legs is broken: I entreat you, if you be a Christian gentleman, not to kill me, which will be committing grave sacrilege, for I am a licentiate and I hold first orders.”</p> 
<p>“Then what the devil brought you here, being a churchman?” said Don Quixote.</p> 
<p>“What, senor?” said the other. “My bad luck.”</p> 
<p>“Then still worse awaits you,” said Don Quixote, “if you do not satisfy me as to all I asked you at first.”</p> 
<p>“You shall be soon satisfied,” said the licentiate; “you must know, then, that though just now I said I was a licentiate, I am only a bachelor, and my name is Alonzo Lopez; I am a native of Alcobendas, I come from the city of Baeza with eleven others, priests, the same who fled with the torches, and we are going to the city of Segovia accompanying a dead body which is in that litter, and is that of a gentleman who died in Baeza, where he was interred; and now, as I said, we are taking his bones to their burial-place, which is in Segovia, where he was born.”</p> 
<p>“And who killed him?” asked Don Quixote.</p> 
<p>“God, by means of a malignant fever that took him,” answered the bachelor.</p> 
<p>“In that case,” said Don Quixote, “the Lord has relieved me of the task of avenging his death had any other slain him; but, he who slew him having slain him, there is nothing for it but to be silent, and shrug one’s shoulders; I should do the same were he to slay myself; and I would have your reverence know that I am a knight of La Mancha, Don Quixote by name, and it is my business and calling to roam the world righting wrongs and redressing injuries.”</p> 
<p>“I do not know how that about righting wrongs can be,” said the bachelor, “for from straight you have made me crooked, leaving me with a broken leg that will never see itself straight again all the days of its life; and the injury you have redressed in my case has been to leave me injured in such a way that I shall remain injured for ever; and the height of misadventure it was to fall in with you who go in search of adventures.”</p> 
<p>“Things do not all happen in the same way,” answered Don Quixote; “it all came, Sir Bachelor Alonzo Lopez, of your going, as you did, by night, dressed in those surplices, with lighted torches, praying, covered with mourning, so that naturally you looked like something evil and of the other world; and so I could not avoid doing my duty in attacking you, and I should have attacked you even had I known positively that you were the very devils of hell, for such I certainly believed and took you to be.”</p> 
<p>“As my fate has so willed it,” said the bachelor, “I entreat you, sir knight-errant, whose errand has been such an evil one for me, to help me to get from under this mule that holds one of my legs caught between the stirrup and the saddle.”</p> 
<p>“I would have talked on till to-morrow,” said Don Quixote; “how long were you going to wait before telling me of your distress?”</p> 
<p>He at once called to Sancho, who, however, had no mind to come, as he was just then engaged in unloading a sumpter mule, well laden with provender, which these worthy gentlemen had brought with them. Sancho made a bag of his coat, and, getting together as much as he could, and as the bag would hold, he loaded his beast, and then hastened to obey his master’s call, and helped him to remove the bachelor from under the mule; then putting him on her back he gave him the torch, and Don Quixote bade him follow the track of his companions, and beg pardon of them on his part for the wrong which he could not help doing them.</p> 
<p>And said Sancho, “If by chance these gentlemen should want to know who was the hero that served them so, your worship may tell them that he is the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.”</p> 
<p>The bachelor then took his departure.</p> 
<p>I forgot to mention that before he did so he said to Don Quixote, “Remember that you stand excommunicated for having laid violent hands on a holy thing, juxta illud, si quis, suadente diabolo.”</p> 
<p>“I do not understand that Latin,” answered Don Quixote, “but I know well I did not lay hands, only this pike; besides, I did not think I was committing an assault upon priests or things of the Church, which, like a Catholic and faithful Christian as I am, I respect and revere, but upon phantoms and spectres of the other world; but even so, I remember how it fared with Cid Ruy Diaz when he broke the chair of the ambassador of that king before his Holiness the Pope, who excommunicated him for the same; and yet the good Roderick of Vivar bore himself that day like a very noble and valiant knight.”</p> 
<p>On hearing this the bachelor took his departure, as has been said, without making any reply; and Don Quixote asked Sancho what had induced him to call him the “Knight of the Rueful Countenance” more then than at any other time.</p> 
<p>“I will tell you,” answered Sancho; “it was because I have been looking at you for some time by the light of the torch held by that unfortunate, and verily your worship has got of late the most ill-favoured countenance I ever saw: it must be either owing to the fatigue of this combat, or else to the want of teeth and grinders.”</p> 
<p>“It is not that,” replied Don Quixote, “but because the sage whose duty it will be to write the history of my achievements must have thought it proper that I should take some distinctive name as all knights of yore did; one being ‘He of the Burning Sword,’ another ‘He of the Unicorn,’ this one ‘He of the Damsels,’ that ‘He of the Phoenix,’ another ‘The Knight of the Griffin,’ and another ‘He of the Death,’ and by these names and designations they were known all the world round; and so I say that the sage aforesaid must have put it into your mouth and mind just now to call me ‘The Knight of the Rueful Countenance,’ as I intend to call myself from this day forward; and that the said name may fit me better, I mean, when the opportunity offers, to have a very rueful countenance painted on my shield.”</p> 
<p>“There is no occasion, senor, for wasting time or money on making that countenance,” said Sancho; “for all that need be done is for your worship to show your own, face to face, to those who look at you, and without anything more, either image or shield, they will call you ‘Him of the Rueful Countenance’ and believe me I am telling you the truth, for I assure you, senor (and in good part be it said), hunger and the loss of your grinders have given you such an ill-favoured face that, as I say, the rueful picture may be very well spared.”</p> 
<p>Don Quixote laughed at Sancho’s pleasantry; nevertheless he resolved to call himself by that name, and have his shield or buckler painted as he had devised.</p> 
<p>Don Quixote would have looked to see whether the body in the litter were bones or not, but Sancho would not have it, saying:</p> 
<p>“Senor, you have ended this perilous adventure more safely for yourself than any of those I have seen: perhaps these people, though beaten and routed, may bethink themselves that it is a single man that has beaten them, and feeling sore and ashamed of it may take heart and come in search of us and give us trouble enough. The ass is in proper trim, the mountains are near at hand, hunger presses, we have nothing more to do but make good our retreat, and, as the saying is, the dead to the grave and the living to the loaf.”</p> 
<p>And driving his ass before him he begged his master to follow, who, feeling that Sancho was right, did so without replying; and after proceeding some little distance between two hills they found themselves in a wide and retired valley, where they alighted, and Sancho unloaded his beast, and stretched upon the green grass, with hunger for sauce, they breakfasted, dined, lunched, and supped all at once, satisfying their appetites with more than one store of cold meat which the dead man’s clerical gentlemen (who seldom put themselves on short allowance) had brought with them on their sumpter mule. But another piece of ill-luck befell them, which Sancho held the worst of all, and that was that they had no wine to drink, nor even water to moisten their lips; and as thirst tormented them, Sancho, observing that the meadow where they were was full of green and tender grass, said what will be told in the following chapter.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“这几天咱们碰到了不少晦气，大人，我敢肯定，这是您违反了骑士规则而受到的惩罚。您没有履行您在夺取马兰德里诺（或者叫摩尔人，我记不清了）的头盔之前不上桌吃饭、不和女王睡觉以及其他的种种誓言。”</p> 
<p>“你说得对，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“说实话，那些誓言我早就忘了。不过你也该明白，由于你没有及时提醒我，才发生了你被人用被单扔的事情。然而，我会设法弥补的，骑士界里有各种挽救损失的办法。”</p> 
<p>“难道我发过什么誓吗？”桑乔问。</p> 
<p>“是否发过誓倒无关紧要，”唐吉诃德说，“我只是大概知道你没参与，这就够了，不管怎样，采取补救措施总不会错。”</p> 
<p>“既然这样，”桑乔说，“这事您可别忘了，就好比别忘了誓言一样。也许那些鬼怪又会想起来拿我开心呢。要是它们看到您还是这么固执，说不定还会找您的麻烦呢。”</p> 
<p>两人边走边说，已经傍晚了，也没有发现一个可以过夜的地方。糟糕的是他们饿得厉害，可褡裢丢了，所有的干粮也没有了。真是祸不单行。他们果真遇到了麻烦事。当时已近黄昏，可两人还在赶路。桑乔觉得既然他们走的是正路，再走一两西里，肯定会有客店。走着走着，夜幕降临。桑乔饥肠辘辘，唐吉诃德也食欲难捺。这时，他们看见路上有一片亮光向他们移动过来，像是群星向他们靠拢。桑乔见状惊恐万分，唐吉诃德也不无畏怯。桑乔抓住驴的缰绳，唐吉诃德也拽紧了罗西南多，两人愣在那里，仔细看那是什么东西。那些亮光越来越近，越来越大，桑乔怕得直发抖，唐吉诃德的头发也直竖起来。他壮了壮胆，说：</p> 
<p>“桑乔，这肯定是咱们遇到的最严重、最危险的遭遇。现在该显示我的全部勇气和力量了。”</p> 
<p>“我真倒霉，”桑乔说，“如果这又是那伙妖魔做怪，我就是这么认为的，那么我的背怎么受得了啊？”</p> 
<p>“即使是再大的妖怪，”唐吉诃德说，“我也不会允许它们碰你的一根毫毛。那次是因为我上不了墙头，才让它们得以拿你开心的。可这次咱们是在平原上，我完全可以任意挥舞我的剑。”</p> 
<p>“如果它们又像那次那样，对您施了魔法，让您手脚麻木，”桑乔说，“在不在平原上又有什么用呢？”</p> 
<p>“无论如何，”唐吉诃德说，“我求求你，桑乔，打起精神来，到时候你就会知道我的本事了。”</p> 
<p>“上帝保佑，我会知道的。”桑乔说。</p> 
<p>两人来到路旁，仔细观察那堆走近的亮光到底是什么东西。他们很快就发现原来是许多穿白色法衣的人，这一看可把桑乔的锐气一下子打了下去。他开始牙齿打颤，就像患了疟疾时发冷一样。待两人完全看清楚了，桑乔的牙齿颤得更厉害了。原来那近二十名白衣人都骑着马，手里举着火把，后面还有人抬着一个盖着黑布的棺材，接着是六个从人头到骡蹄子都遮着黑布的骑骡子的人。那牲口走路慢腾腾的，显然不是马。</p> 
<p>那些身穿白色法衣的人低声交谈着。这个时候在旷野里看到这种人，也难怪桑乔从心里感到恐惧，连唐吉诃德都害怕了。唐吉诃德一害怕，桑乔就更没了勇气。不过，这时唐吉诃德忽然一转念，想象这就是小说里一次历险的再现。他想象那棺材里躺着一位受了重伤或者已经死去的骑士，只有自己才能为那位骑士报仇。他二话不说，托定长矛，气宇轩昂地站在路中央那些人的必经之处，看他们走近了，便提高嗓门说道：</p> 
<p>“站住，骑士们，或者随便你们是什么人。快告诉我，你们是什么人，从哪儿来，到哪儿去，棺材里装的是什么。看样子，你们是干了什么坏事，或者是有人坑了你们，最好还是让我知道，好让我或者对你们做的坏事进行惩罚，或者为你们受的欺负报仇。”</p> 
<p>“我们还有急事，”一个白衣人说，“离客店还很远，我们不能在此跟你费这么多口舌。”</p> 
<p>说着他催马向前。唐吉诃德闻言勃然大怒，抓住那匹马的缰绳，说：</p> 
<p>“站住，规矩点儿，快回答我的问话，否则，我就要对你们动手了。”</p> 
<p>那是一匹极易受惊的骡子。唐吉诃德一抓它的缰绳，立刻把它吓得扬起前蹄，将主人从它的屁股后面摔到地上。一个步行的伙计见状便对唐吉诃德骂起来。唐吉诃德立刻怒上心头，持矛向一个穿丧服的人刺去。那人伤得很厉害，摔倒在地。唐吉诃德又转身冲向其他人，看他冲刺的那个利索勇猛劲儿，仿佛给罗西南多安上了一对翅膀，使得它轻松矫捷。那些白衣人都胆小，又没带武器，无意恋战，马上在原野上狂奔起来，手里还举着火把，样子很像节日夜晚奔跑的化装骑手。那些穿黑衣的人被衣服裹着动弹不得，使唐吉诃德得以很从容地痛打他们。他们以为这家伙不是人，而是一个地狱里的魔鬼，跑出来抢夺棺材里的那具尸体，也只好败阵而逃。</p> 
<p>桑乔把这一切都看在眼里，很佩服主人的勇猛，心里想：“我这位主人还真像他自己说的那样勇敢无畏。”刚才被骡子扔下来的那个人身旁有支火把还在燃烧。唐吉诃德借着火光发现了他，于是走到他身旁，用矛头指着他的脸，让他投降，否则就杀了他。那人答道：</p> 
<p>“我有一条腿断了，动弹不得，早已投降了，如果您是位基督教勇士，我请求您不要杀我，否则您就亵渎了神明。我是教士，而且是高级教士。”</p> 
<p>“你既然是教士，是什么鬼把你带到这儿来了？”唐吉诃德问。</p> 
<p>“大人，您问是什么鬼？是我的晦气。”那人答道。</p> 
<p>“你要是不回答我刚才的问题，”唐吉诃德说，“还有更大的晦气等着你呢。”</p> 
<p>“您马上会得到回答，”教士说，“是这样，您知道，刚才我说我是个教士，其实我只不过是个传道员。我叫阿隆索·洛佩斯，是阿尔科本达斯人。我从塞哥维亚城来。同来的还有十一个教士，也就是刚才举着火把逃跑的那几个人。我们正在护送棺材里的尸体。那个人死在巴埃萨，尸体原来也停放在那里。他是塞哥维亚人，现在我们要把他的尸体送回去安葬。”</p> 
<p>“是谁害了他？”唐吉诃德问。</p> 
<p>“是上帝借一次瘟疫发高烧送走了他。”</p> 
<p>“既然这样，”唐吉诃德说，“上帝也把我解脱了。要是别人害死了他，我还得替他报仇。既然是上帝送他走，我就没什么可说了，只能耸耸肩。即使上帝送我走，我也只能如此。我想让你知道，我是曼查的骑士，名叫唐吉诃德。我的职责就是游历四方，除暴安良，报仇雪恨。”</p> 
<p>“我不知道你这叫什么除暴，”传道员说，“你不由分说就弄断了我的一条腿，我这条腿恐怕一辈子也站不直了。你为我雪的恨就是让我遗恨终生。你还寻险呢，碰见你就让我够险的了。”</p> 
<p>“世事不尽相同，”唐吉诃德说，“问题在于你，阿隆索·洛佩斯传道员，像个夜游神，穿着白色法衣，手里举着火把，嘴里祈祷着，身上还戴着孝，完全像另一个世界里的妖怪。这样我不得不履行我的职责，向你出击。哪怕知道你真是地狱里的魔鬼，我也得向你进攻。我一直把你们当成了地狱的魔鬼。”</p> 
<p>“看来我是命该如此了，”传道员说，“求求您，游侠骑士，请您帮忙把我从骡子底下弄出来，我的脚别在马鞍和脚蹬中间了。”</p> 
<p>“我怎么忘了这件事呢，”唐吉诃德说，“你还想等到什么时候再提醒我呀。”</p> 
<p>然后，唐吉诃德喊桑乔过来。桑乔并没有理会，他正忙着从教士们的一匹备用马上卸货，全是些吃的东西。桑乔用外衣卷成个口袋，使劲往里面装，然后把东西放到他的驴上，才应着唐吉诃德的喊声走过来，帮着唐吉诃德把传道员从骡子身下拉出来，扶他上马，又将火把递给他。唐吉诃德让他去追赶他的同伴们，并且向他道歉，说刚才的冒犯是身不由己。桑乔也对传道员说：</p> 
<p>“如果那些大人想知道打败他们的这位勇士是谁，您可以告诉他们，是曼查的唐吉诃德，他另外还有个名字叫‘猥獕骑士’。”</p> 
<p>传道员走后，唐吉诃德问桑乔怎么想起叫自己“猥獕骑士”。</p> 
<p>“我这么说是因为我借着那个倒霉旅客的火把光亮看了您一会儿，”桑乔说，“您的样子确实是我见过的最猥獕的样子。这大概是因为您打累了，或者因为您缺了很多牙。”</p> 
<p>“并非如此，”唐吉诃德说，“大概是负责撰写我的业绩的那位贤人找过你，说我最好还是取个绰号，就像以前所有的骑士一样。他们有的叫火剑骑士，有的叫独角兽骑士，这个叫少女骑士，那个叫凤凰骑士，另外一个叫鬈发骑士，还有的叫死亡骑士，这些名称或绰号尽人皆知。所以我说，准是那位贤人把让我叫‘猥獕骑士’的想法加进了你的语言和思想。这个名字很适合我，我想从现在起就叫这个名字。以后如果盾牌上有地方，我还要在我的盾牌上画一个猥獕的人呢。”</p> 
<p>“没必要浪费钱和时间做这种事情，”桑乔说，“现在您只须把您的面孔和您本人暴露在众目睽睽之下，用不着其他什么形象或盾牌，人们就会称您是猥獕骑士。请您相信我说的是真话，我敢肯定，大人，说句笑话，挨饿和掉牙齿已经让您的脸够难看的了，我刚才说过，完全不必要再画那幅猥獕相了。”</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德被桑乔这么风趣逗笑了，不过，他还是想叫这个名字，而且仍要把这幅样子画在盾牌上，就像原来设想的那样。唐吉诃德对桑乔说：</p> 
<p>“我明白，桑乔，我现在已经被逐出教会了，因为我对圣物粗鲁地动了手。‘受魔鬼诱惑者，与魔鬼同罪’，尽管我知道我动的不是手，而是短矛，而且当时我并不是想去袭击教士和教会的东西。对于教士和教会的东西，我像天主教徒和虔诚的基督教徒一样尊重和崇拜。我只是想消灭另一个世界的妖魔鬼怪。如果把我逐出教会，我就会记起锡德·鲁伊·迪亚斯由于当着教皇陛下的面砸了那个国王使节的椅子而被逐出了教会的事。那天罗德里戈·德比瓦尔表现得也很好，像个勇敢正直的骑士。”</p> 
<p>听到这些，传道员什么话也没说便离去了①。唐吉诃德想看看棺材里的尸体是不是已经变成尸骨，桑乔不同意，说：</p> 
<p>“大人，您刚刚又冒了一次险，这是我见过的您受伤最少的一次。这些人虽然被打败了，但他们很可能想起来，他们是被一个人打败的，会恼羞成怒，再来找咱们的麻烦。驴已经安排好了，附近有山，咱们的肚子也饿了，最好现在就悠悠地启程吧。俗话说，‘死人找坟墓，活人奔面包’。”</p> 
<p>①前一页说传道员已走，此处又说传道员离去，显系作者的疏忽。</p> 
<p>桑乔牵着驴，求唐吉诃德跟他走。唐吉诃德觉得桑乔说的有理，不再说什么就跟着桑乔走了。两人走了不远，来到两山之间一个人迹罕见的空旷山谷里，下了马。桑乔把驴背上的东西拿下来，两人躺在绿草地上，饥不择食地把早饭、午饭、点心和晚饭合成一顿，把送尸体的教士骡子上带的饭盒（他们一直过得很不错）吃了好几个，填饱了肚子。可是，还有一件不顺心的事，桑乔觉得这事最糟糕，那就是教士们没有带酒，连喝的水也没有，两人渴得厉害。桑乔看着绿草如茵的平原，讲了一番话，内容详见下章。</p>
