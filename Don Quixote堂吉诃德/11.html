Seeing, therefore, that the struggle was now over, and that his master was returning to mount Rocinante, he approached to hold the stirrup for him, and, before he could mount, he went on his knees before him, and taking his hand, kissed it saying, “May it please your worship, Senor Don Quixote, to give me the government of that island which has been won in this hard fight, for be it ever so big I feel myself in sufficient force to be able to govern it as much and as well as anyone in the world who has ever governed islands.”</p> 
<p>To which Don Quixote replied, “Thou must take notice, brother Sancho, that this adventure and those like it are not adventures of islands, but of cross-roads, in which nothing is got except a broken head or an ear the less: have patience, for adventures will present themselves from which I may make you, not only a governor, but something more.”</p> 
<p>Sancho gave him many thanks, and again kissing his hand and the skirt of his hauberk, helped him to mount Rocinante, and mounting his ass himself, proceeded to follow his master, who at a brisk pace, without taking leave, or saying anything further to the ladies belonging to the coach, turned into a wood that was hard by. Sancho followed him at his ass’s best trot, but Rocinante stepped out so that, seeing himself left behind, he was forced to call to his master to wait for him. Don Quixote did so, reining in Rocinante until his weary squire came up, who on reaching him said, “It seems to me, senor, it would be prudent in us to go and take refuge in some church, for, seeing how mauled he with whom you fought has been left, it will be no wonder if they give information of the affair to the Holy Brotherhood and arrest us, and, faith, if they do, before we come out of gaol we shall have to sweat for it.”</p> 
<p>“Peace,” said Don Quixote; “where hast thou ever seen or heard that a knight-errant has been arraigned before a court of justice, however many homicides he may have committed?”</p> 
<p>“I know nothing about omecils,” answered Sancho, “nor in my life have had anything to do with one; I only know that the Holy Brotherhood looks after those who fight in the fields, and in that other matter I do not meddle.”</p> 
<p>“Then thou needst have no uneasiness, my friend,” said Don Quixote, “for I will deliver thee out of the hands of the Chaldeans, much more out of those of the Brotherhood. But tell me, as thou livest, hast thou seen a more valiant knight than I in all the known world; hast thou read in history of any who has or had higher mettle in attack, more spirit in maintaining it, more dexterity in wounding or skill in overthrowing?”</p> 
<p>“The truth is,” answered Sancho, “that I have never read any history, for I can neither read nor write, but what I will venture to bet is that a more daring master than your worship I have never served in all the days of my life, and God grant that this daring be not paid for where I have said; what I beg of your worship is to dress your wound, for a great deal of blood flows from that ear, and I have here some lint and a little white ointment in the alforjas.”</p> 
<p>“All that might be well dispensed with,” said Don Quixote, “if I had remembered to make a vial of the balsam of Fierabras, for time and medicine are saved by one single drop.”</p> 
<p>“What vial and what balsam is that?” said Sancho Panza.</p> 
<p>“It is a balsam,” answered Don Quixote, “the receipt of which I have in my memory, with which one need have no fear of death, or dread dying of any wound; and so when I make it and give it to thee thou hast nothing to do when in some battle thou seest they have cut me in half through the middle of the body — as is wont to happen frequently, — but neatly and with great nicety, ere the blood congeal, to place that portion of the body which shall have fallen to the ground upon the other half which remains in the saddle, taking care to fit it on evenly and exactly. Then thou shalt give me to drink but two drops of the balsam I have mentioned, and thou shalt see me become sounder than an apple.”</p> 
<p>“If that be so,” said Panza, “I renounce henceforth the government of the promised island, and desire nothing more in payment of my many and faithful services than that your worship give me the receipt of this supreme liquor, for I am persuaded it will be worth more than two reals an ounce anywhere, and I want no more to pass the rest of my life in ease and honour; but it remains to be told if it costs much to make it.”</p> 
<p>“With less than three reals, six quarts of it may be made,” said Don Quixote.</p> 
<p>“Sinner that I am!” said Sancho, “then why does your worship put off making it and teaching it to me?”</p> 
<p>“Peace, friend,” answered Don Quixote; “greater secrets I mean to teach thee and greater favours to bestow upon thee; and for the present let us see to the dressing, for my ear pains me more than I could wish.”</p> 
<p>Sancho took out some lint and ointment from the alforjas; but when Don Quixote came to see his helmet shattered, he was like to lose his senses, and clapping his hand upon his sword and raising his eyes to heaven, be said, “I swear by the Creator of all things and the four Gospels in their fullest extent, to do as the great Marquis of Mantua did when he swore to avenge the death of his nephew Baldwin (and that was not to eat bread from a table-cloth, nor embrace his wife, and other points which, though I cannot now call them to mind, I here grant as expressed) until I take complete vengeance upon him who has committed such an offence against me.”</p> 
<p>Hearing this, Sancho said to him, “Your worship should bear in mind, Senor Don Quixote, that if the knight has done what was commanded him in going to present himself before my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, he will have done all that he was bound to do, and does not deserve further punishment unless he commits some new offence.”</p> 
<p>“Thou hast said well and hit the point,” answered Don Quixote; and so I recall the oath in so far as relates to taking fresh vengeance on him, but I make and confirm it anew to lead the life I have said until such time as I take by force from some knight another helmet such as this and as good; and think not, Sancho, that I am raising smoke with straw in doing so, for I have one to imitate in the matter, since the very same thing to a hair happened in the case of Mambrino’s helmet, which cost Sacripante so dear.”</p> 
<p>“Senor,” replied Sancho, “let your worship send all such oaths to the devil, for they are very pernicious to salvation and prejudicial to the conscience; just tell me now, if for several days to come we fall in with no man armed with a helmet, what are we to do? Is the oath to be observed in spite of all the inconvenience and discomfort it will be to sleep in your clothes, and not to sleep in a house, and a thousand other mortifications contained in the oath of that old fool the Marquis of Mantua, which your worship is now wanting to revive? Let your worship observe that there are no men in armour travelling on any of these roads, nothing but carriers and carters, who not only do not wear helmets, but perhaps never heard tell of them all their lives.”</p> 
<p>“Thou art wrong there,” said Don Quixote, “for we shall not have been above two hours among these cross-roads before we see more men in armour than came to Albraca to win the fair Angelica.”</p> 
<p>“Enough,” said Sancho; “so be it then, and God grant us success, and that the time for winning that island which is costing me so dear may soon come, and then let me die.”</p> 
<p>“I have already told thee, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “not to give thyself any uneasiness on that score; for if an island should fail, there is the kingdom of Denmark, or of Sobradisa, which will fit thee as a ring fits the finger, and all the more that, being on terra firma, thou wilt all the better enjoy thyself. But let us leave that to its own time; see if thou hast anything for us to eat in those alforjas, because we must presently go in quest of some castle where we may lodge to-night and make the balsam I told thee of, for I swear to thee by God, this ear is giving me great pain.”</p> 
<p>“I have here an onion and a little cheese and a few scraps of bread,” said Sancho, “but they are not victuals fit for a valiant knight like your worship.”</p> 
<p>“How little thou knowest about it,” answered Don Quixote; “I would have thee to know, Sancho, that it is the glory of knights-errant to go without eating for a month, and even when they do eat, that it should be of what comes first to hand; and this would have been clear to thee hadst thou read as many histories as I have, for, though they are very many, among them all I have found no mention made of knights-errant eating, unless by accident or at some sumptuous banquets prepared for them, and the rest of the time they passed in dalliance. And though it is plain they could not do without eating and performing all the other natural functions, because, in fact, they were men like ourselves, it is plain too that, wandering as they did the most part of their lives through woods and wilds and without a cook, their most usual fare would be rustic viands such as those thou now offer me; so that, friend Sancho, let not that distress thee which pleases me, and do not seek to make a new world or pervert knight-errantry.”</p> 
<p>“Pardon me, your worship,” said Sancho, “for, as I cannot read or write, as I said just now, I neither know nor comprehend the rules of the profession of chivalry: henceforward I will stock the alforjas with every kind of dry fruit for your worship, as you are a knight; and for myself, as I am not one, I will furnish them with poultry and other things more substantial.”</p> 
<p>“I do not say, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “that it is imperative on knights-errant not to eat anything else but the fruits thou speakest of; only that their more usual diet must be those, and certain herbs they found in the fields which they knew and I know too.”</p> 
<p>“A good thing it is,” answered Sancho, “to know those herbs, for to my thinking it will be needful some day to put that knowledge into practice.”</p> 
<p>And here taking out what he said he had brought, the pair made their repast peaceably and sociably. But anxious to find quarters for the night, they with all despatch made an end of their poor dry fare, mounted at once, and made haste to reach some habitation before night set in; but daylight and the hope of succeeding in their object failed them close by the huts of some goatherds, so they determined to pass the night there, and it was as much to Sancho’s discontent not to have reached a house, as it was to his master’s satisfaction to sleep under the open heaven, for he fancied that each time this happened to him he performed an act of ownership that helped to prove his chivalry.</p>

<p>桑乔·潘萨被教士的伙计打了一顿，这时也站了起来。他一直关注着主人唐吉诃德的战斗，心里祈求上帝保佑主人胜利，能够夺取某个小岛，让他如约当个总督。因此，他看到战斗结束，主人准备翻身上马时，便抓住马蹬，不等主人上马便跑在主人面前，抓住主人的手吻了一下，说：</p> 
<p>“我的唐吉诃德大人，请您把在这场激战中赢得的小岛赐予我吧。不管它有多大，我自认为有能力像世界上其他管理小岛的人一样，管理好这个岛。”</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德答道：</p> 
<p>“听着，桑乔兄弟，这次征险以及其它此类征险并不是争岛之险，只是路遇之战。这种战斗只能落个头破或耳缺。别着急，以后还会遇到征险，那时候你不仅可以当总督，而且可以做更大的官。”</p> 
<p>桑乔感激万分，他再次吻唐吉诃德的手和护马甲，扶唐吉诃德上罗西南多，自己也骑上驴，没同车上的夫人告辞或再说点什么，就快步跟在主人后面，走进旁边的一片树林。桑乔紧催他的驴追赶，可是罗西南多走得很快，眼看他已落在后面，只好拉开嗓门，让主人等等他。唐吉诃德勒住罗西南多的缰绳，等这位疲惫不堪的侍从赶上来。桑乔刚一赶上，就说：</p> 
<p>“大人，我觉得咱们最好先到某个教堂去暂避一时。刚才同您战斗的那个人受了伤，很快就会向圣友团①报告，追捕咱们。若是把咱们抓住了，要逃出来就不那么简单了。”</p> 
<p>①圣友团是西班牙于1476年建立的民团，旨在保护居民不受盗匪侵犯。</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德说：“住嘴！游侠骑士可以杀人累累，哪儿有被抓起来的！你见到过或读到过吗？”</p> 
<p>“我对杀人罪一无所知，”桑乔说，“也从来没对任何人做过这种事。别的我不管，我只知道圣友团专管野外争斗的事。”</p> 
<p>“别担心，朋友，”唐吉诃德说，“即使你落在迦勒底人手里，我也会把你救出来，更别说圣友团了。不过你说实话，你看世界上是否还有比我英勇的骑士？在你读过的传记里，是否有人比我更能攻善守、巧制强敌？”</p> 
<p>桑乔答道：“实际上，我既不会念，也不会写，从没读过任何传记。不过我敢打赌，比您更神勇的主人，我这一辈子从没服侍过。愿上帝保佑，您这种神勇别在我刚才说的那个地方受挫。我要请求您的是给自己治伤。您那只耳朵流了很多血。我的褡裢里有纱布，还有些白药膏。”</p> 
<p>“这些都不需要，”唐吉诃德说，“要是我早想到做一瓶菲耶拉布拉斯①圣水，只需一滴，便可以即刻痊愈。”</p> 
<p>“那是什么圣瓶、什么圣水呀？”桑乔问。</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德说：“那种圣水的配方我还记得。有了那种圣水就舍身无所惧，受伤不致亡了。我把圣水做好了就交给你。你要是看到我在战斗中被拦腰斩断（这种事常有），就在血还未凝固之前，把我轻巧落地的上半身非常仔细地安放在鞍子上另外那半截身子上，要注意安放得完好如初。然后，你再喂我两口我刚才说的那种圣水，你就会看到，我依然完好无恙。”</p> 
<p>“如果有那种圣水，”桑乔说，“我从现在起就放弃原来当海岛总督的要求。作为对我诸多周到服侍的回报，我不要别的，只求您把那种圣水的配方告诉我。我估计无论在什么地方，一盎司圣水都可以卖两个雷阿尔以上。有了它，我就可以过一辈子体面舒服的日子了。不过我想知道，要做那种圣水是不是得花很多钱？”</p> 
<p>“用不了三个雷阿尔就可以做三阿孙勃雷②的圣水。”唐吉诃德说。</p> 
<p>①菲耶拉布拉斯是查理大帝的武士，据说他得到了耶稣就难时的荆冠与圣水。</p> 
<p>②容量单位，一阿孙勃雷相当于2．016公升。</p> 
<p>“都怨我，”桑乔说，“那么您还等什么，为什么不现在就做圣水，并且教我做呢？”</p> 
<p>“住嘴，朋友，”唐吉诃德说，“我想教给你更大的秘诀，让你得到更多的利益。现在咱们先治伤。我这只耳朵疼得很厉害。”</p> 
<p>桑乔从褡裢里拿出了纱布和药膏。可是，唐吉诃德一看到自己的头盔破了，又走火入魔了。他一手按剑，仰望天空，说道：</p> 
<p>“我要向万物的创造者和四大《福音》巨著发誓，在向那个对我无礼的家伙报仇之前，我要过曼图亚侯爵那样的生活。他为了给他的侄子巴尔多维诺斯报仇，食不近桌，眠不近妻，还有其它一些情况，我想不起来了，不过我都发誓要一一照做。”</p> 
<p>桑乔闻言说道：</p> 
<p>“您看，唐吉诃德大人，如果那个骑士按照您的吩咐去拜见了托博索的杜尔西尼亚夫人，他的事也就算完了。只要他不再做别的坏事，就不该再受惩罚。”</p> 
<p>“你说得千真万确，”唐吉诃德说，“我取消要向他报仇的盟誓。不过我还要发誓，在从某个骑士那里抢到一个与此头盔一模一样的头盔之前，我还要过我刚才说的那种生活。桑乔，你不要以为我只是心血来潮，我是在效仿先人。我的头盔和曼布里诺的头盔完全一样，萨克里潘特为此可付出了臣大的代价。”</p> 
<p>“这种誓言您还是让魔鬼去说吧，我的大人，”桑乔说，“这样既伤身体又伤神。不信，您现在就告诉我，假如我们很多天都碰不到一个身披甲胄、头戴头盔的人怎么办？您难道真的为了实现自己的誓言而给自己找种种麻烦，例如和衣睡觉，露宿风餐，还有那位曼图亚老侯爵发誓要做的那些乱七八糟的事情？您看看，这路上根本没有披甲胄的人，全是些脚夫车夫。他们不仅不戴头盔，也许一辈子都没听说过头盔呢。”</p> 
<p>“你错了，”唐吉诃德说，“用不了两个小时，咱们在这个路口就可以看到，披挂甲胄的人比去阿尔布拉卡追求安吉丽嘉①的人还多。”</p> 
<p>①安吉丽嘉是契丹公主，阿尔布拉卡是她所居住的城堡。</p> 
<p>“好吧，但愿如此，”桑乔说，“求上帝让我们走运。现在应该出大代价赢得这个岛屿，然后我就是死也闭眼了。”</p> 
<p>“我对你说过，桑乔，你别担心。要是没有岛屿，一定会有丹麦王国或索夫拉迪萨王国在恭候你，而且还是在陆地上，你应该高兴。咱们先不谈这个，你先看看褡裢里是否有什么食物，吃完好去找个城堡过夜，做我说的那种圣水。说实话，我的耳朵疼得很厉害。”</p> 
<p>“我这儿有一个葱头、一点儿干酪和几块硬面包，”桑乔说，“不过这不是您这种勇敢骑士吃的东西。”</p> 
<p>“你怎么这样想！”唐吉诃德说，“你要知道，桑乔，一个月不吃东西是游侠骑士的骄傲。即使吃，也是有什么吃什么。你若是像我一样读很多书，就知道这确有其事。不过，虽然这种书很多，却并不意味着游侠骑士除了偶尔吃一些奢侈的宴会之外，整日节食。我们可以想象，他们不能不吃东西，不能没有其他一些本能的需要，因为他们也是和我们一样的人。而且你也该知道，他们一生中大部分时间周游于野林荒郊，又没有厨师，所以他们的日常食物就是粗茶淡饭，就像你给我的那些食物一样。所以，桑乔朋友，你别担心，我愿意要这种东西。你也不要别出心裁，惹游侠骑士生气。”</p> 
<p>“对不起，”桑乔说，“我刚才说过，我既不会读，也不会写，根本不懂骑士的规矩。从现在起，我负责为您这位骑士提供各种干果作食品。我不是骑士，所以就给自己准备些飞禽或其它更有营养的东西。”</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德说：“桑乔，我不是说骑士只能吃你说的那些果子，而是说他们最通常的食物是那些东西和一些野草。他们能辨别那些野草，我也能。”</p> 
<p>桑乔说：“能够辨别那些野草可有用呢。我想，说不定哪天就用得上。”</p> 
<p>桑乔把带的东西拿了出来，两人和和气气地吃起来。不过，他们又急于找到一个过夜的地方，便草草吃完了那些冷干粮，骑上马连忙赶路，要在天黑之前赶到村落。可是他们只看到几间牧羊人的茅屋，于是决定在那儿过夜。桑乔为没能赶到村落而沮丧，可唐吉诃德却很愿意露宿。每当遇到这种情况时，他都认为这是锻炼其骑士精神的好机会。</p>
