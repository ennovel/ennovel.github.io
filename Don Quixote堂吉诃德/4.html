<p>The landlord, who, as has been mentioned, was something of a wag, and had already some suspicion of his guest’s want of wits, was quite convinced of it on hearing talk of this kind from him, and to make sport for the night he determined to fall in with his humour. So he told him he was quite right in pursuing the object he had in view, and that such a motive was natural and becoming in cavaliers as distinguished as he seemed and his gallant bearing showed him to be; and that he himself in his younger days had followed the same honourable calling, roaming in quest of adventures in various parts of the world, among others the Curing-grounds of Malaga, the Isles of Riaran, the Precinct of Seville, the Little Market of Segovia, the Olivera of Valencia, the Rondilla of Granada, the Strand of San Lucar, the Colt of Cordova, the Taverns of Toledo, and divers other quarters, where he had proved the nimbleness of his feet and the lightness of his fingers, doing many wrongs, cheating many widows, ruining maids and swindling minors, and, in short, bringing himself under the notice of almost every tribunal and court of justice in Spain; until at last he had retired to this castle of his, where he was living upon his property and upon that of others; and where he received all knights-errant of whatever rank or condition they might be, all for the great love he bore them and that they might share their substance with him in return for his benevolence. He told him, moreover, that in this castle of his there was no chapel in which he could watch his armour, as it had been pulled down in order to be rebuilt, but that in a case of necessity it might, he knew, be watched anywhere, and he might watch it that night in a courtyard of the castle, and in the morning, God willing, the requisite ceremonies might be performed so as to have him dubbed a knight, and so thoroughly dubbed that nobody could be more so. He asked if he had any money with him, to which Don Quixote replied that he had not a farthing, as in the histories of knights-errant he had never read of any of them carrying any. On this point the landlord told him he was mistaken; for, though not recorded in the histories, because in the author’s opinion there was no need to mention anything so obvious and necessary as money and clean shirts, it was not to be supposed therefore that they did not carry them, and he might regard it as certain and established that all knights-errant (about whom there were so many full and unimpeachable books) carried well-furnished purses in case of emergency, and likewise carried shirts and a little box of ointment to cure the wounds they received. For in those plains and deserts where they engaged in combat and came out wounded, it was not always that there was some one to cure them, unless indeed they had for a friend some sage magician to succour them at once by fetching through the air upon a cloud some damsel or dwarf with a vial of water of such virtue that by tasting one drop of it they were cured of their hurts and wounds in an instant and left as sound as if they had not received any damage whatever. But in case this should not occur, the knights of old took care to see that their squires were provided with money and other requisites, such as lint and ointments for healing purposes; and when it happened that knights had no squires (which was rarely and seldom the case) they themselves carried everything in cunning saddle-bags that were hardly seen on the horse’s croup, as if it were something else of more importance, because, unless for some such reason, carrying saddle-bags was not very favourably regarded among knights-errant. He therefore advised him (and, as his godson so soon to be, he might even command him) never from that time forth to travel without money and the usual requirements, and he would find the advantage of them when he least expected it.</p> 
<p>Don Quixote promised to follow his advice scrupulously, and it was arranged forthwith that he should watch his armour in a large yard at one side of the inn; so, collecting it all together, Don Quixote placed it on a trough that stood by the side of a well, and bracing his buckler on his arm he grasped his lance and began with a stately air to march up and down in front of the trough, and as he began his march night began to fall.</p> 
<p>The landlord told all the people who were in the inn about the craze of his guest, the watching of the armour, and the dubbing ceremony he contemplated. Full of wonder at so strange a form of madness, they flocked to see it from a distance, and observed with what composure he sometimes paced up and down, or sometimes, leaning on his lance, gazed on his armour without taking his eyes off it for ever so long; and as the night closed in with a light from the moon so brilliant that it might vie with his that lent it, everything the novice knight did was plainly seen by all.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile one of the carriers who were in the inn thought fit to water his team, and it was necessary to remove Don Quixote’s armour as it lay on the trough; but he seeing the other approach hailed him in a loud voice, “O thou, whoever thou art, rash knight that comest to lay hands on the armour of the most valorous errant that ever girt on sword, have a care what thou dost; touch it not unless thou wouldst lay down thy life as the penalty of thy rashness.” The carrier gave no heed to these words (and he would have done better to heed them if he had been heedful of his health), but seizing it by the straps flung the armour some distance from him. Seeing this, Don Quixote raised his eyes to heaven, and fixing his thoughts, apparently, upon his lady Dulcinea, exclaimed, “Aid me, lady mine, in this the first encounter that presents itself to this breast which thou holdest in subjection; let not thy favour and protection fail me in this first jeopardy;” and, with these words and others to the same purpose, dropping his buckler he lifted his lance with both hands and with it smote such a blow on the carrier’s head that he stretched him on the ground, so stunned that had he followed it up with a second there would have been no need of a surgeon to cure him. This done, he picked up his armour and returned to his beat with the same serenity as before.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Shortly after this, another, not knowing what had happened (for the carrier still lay senseless), came with the same object of giving water to his mules, and was proceeding to remove the armour in order to clear the trough, when Don Quixote, without uttering a word or imploring aid from anyone, once more dropped his buckler and once more lifted his lance, and without actually breaking the second carrier’s head into pieces, made more than three of it, for he laid it open in four. At the noise all the people of the inn ran to the spot, and among them the landlord. Seeing this, Don Quixote braced his buckler on his arm, and with his hand on his sword exclaimed, “O Lady of Beauty, strength and support of my faint heart, it is time for thee to turn the eyes of thy greatness on this thy captive knight on the brink of so mighty an adventure.” By this he felt himself so inspired that he would not have flinched if all the carriers in the world had assailed him. The comrades of the wounded perceiving the plight they were in began from a distance to shower stones on Don Quixote, who screened himself as best he could with his buckler, not daring to quit the trough and leave his armour unprotected. The landlord shouted to them to leave him alone, for he had already told them that he was mad, and as a madman he would not be accountable even if he killed them all. Still louder shouted Don Quixote, calling them knaves and traitors, and the lord of the castle, who allowed knights-errant to be treated in this fashion, a villain and a low-born knight whom, had he received the order of knighthood, he would call to account for his treachery. “But of you,” he cried, “base and vile rabble, I make no account; fling, strike, come on, do all ye can against me, ye shall see what the reward of your folly and insolence will be.” This he uttered with so much spirit and boldness that he filled his assailants with a terrible fear, and as much for this reason as at the persuasion of the landlord they left off stoning him, and he allowed them to carry off the wounded, and with the same calmness and composure as before resumed the watch over his armour.</p> 
<p>But these freaks of his guest were not much to the liking of the landlord, so he determined to cut matters short and confer upon him at once the unlucky order of knighthood before any further misadventure could occur; so, going up to him, he apologised for the rudeness which, without his knowledge, had been offered to him by these low people, who, however, had been well punished for their audacity. As he had already told him, he said, there was no chapel in the castle, nor was it needed for what remained to be done, for, as he understood the ceremonial of the order, the whole point of being dubbed a knight lay in the accolade and in the slap on the shoulder, and that could be administered in the middle of a field; and that he had now done all that was needful as to watching the armour, for all requirements were satisfied by a watch of two hours only, while he had been more than four about it. Don Quixote believed it all, and told him he stood there ready to obey him, and to make an end of it with as much despatch as possible; for, if he were again attacked, and felt himself to be dubbed knight, he would not, he thought, leave a soul alive in the castle, except such as out of respect he might spare at his bidding.</p> 
<p>Thus warned and menaced, the castellan forthwith brought out a book in which he used to enter the straw and barley he served out to the carriers, and, with a lad carrying a candle-end, and the two damsels already mentioned, he returned to where Don Quixote stood, and bade him kneel down. Then, reading from his account-book as if he were repeating some devout prayer, in the middle of his delivery he raised his hand and gave him a sturdy blow on the neck, and then, with his own sword, a smart slap on the shoulder, all the while muttering between his teeth as if he was saying his prayers. Having done this, he directed one of the ladies to gird on his sword, which she did with great self-possession and gravity, and not a little was required to prevent a burst of laughter at each stage of the ceremony; but what they had already seen of the novice knight’s prowess kept their laughter within bounds. On girding him with the sword the worthy lady said to him, “May God make your worship a very fortunate knight, and grant you success in battle.” Don Quixote asked her name in order that he might from that time forward know to whom he was beholden for the favour he had received, as he meant to confer upon her some portion of the honour he acquired by the might of his arm. She answered with great humility that she was called La Tolosa, and that she was the daughter of a cobbler of Toledo who lived in the stalls of Sanchobienaya, and that wherever she might be she would serve and esteem him as her lord. Don Quixote said in reply that she would do him a favour if thenceforward she assumed the “Don” and called herself Dona Tolosa. She promised she would, and then the other buckled on his spur, and with her followed almost the same conversation as with the lady of the sword. He asked her name, and she said it was La Molinera, and that she was the daughter of a respectable miller of Antequera; and of her likewise Don Quixote requested that she would adopt the “Don” and call herself Dona Molinera, making offers to her further services and favours.</p> 
<p>Having thus, with hot haste and speed, brought to a conclusion these never-till-now-seen ceremonies, Don Quixote was on thorns until he saw himself on horseback sallying forth in quest of adventures; and saddling Rocinante at once he mounted, and embracing his host, as he returned thanks for his kindness in knighting him, he addressed him in language so extraordinary that it is impossible to convey an idea of it or report it. The landlord, to get him out of the inn, replied with no less rhetoric though with shorter words, and without calling upon him to pay the reckoning let him go with a Godspeed.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>他心中不快，迅速吃完了那可怜的晚餐，叫来店主，两人来到马厩里。他跪在店主面前，对他说：</p> 
<p>“勇敢的骑士，我得劳您大驾。有件事有利于您，也造福于人类。您若不答应，我就不起来。”</p> 
<p>店主看到客人跪倒在脚下，又说了这番话，瞪着眼迷惑不解。店主请他起来，他坚持不起来，店主只好说同意帮忙。</p> 
<p>“我知道您宽宏大量，我的大人。”唐吉诃德说，“是这样，我要劳您大驾而您又慷慨应允的事，就是要您明天封我为骑士。我今晚就在城堡的小教堂守夜①，明天，我说过，就可以完成我的夙愿，就可以周游四方，到处征险，为穷人解难了，这是骑士和像我这样的游侠的责任。我生来就渴望这样的业绩。”</p> 
<p>店主是个比较狡诈的人，对客人的失常已有所察觉。听完这番话，他对此已确信无疑，为了给当晚增添点笑料，决定顺水推舟，于是对他说，他的愿望和要求很正确，这是像他这样仪表堂堂的杰出骑士的特性。他自己年轻的时候也曾投身于这项光荣事业，周游各地，到处征险，连马拉加的佩切莱斯、里亚兰岛、塞维利亚的孔帕斯、塞哥维亚的阿索格拉、巴伦西亚的奥利韦拉、格拉纳达的龙迪利亚、圣卢卡尔海滩、科尔多瓦的波特罗、托莱多的小客店和其他一些地方②都去过，凭着手脚利索，勾引过许多寡妇，糟蹋过几个少女，还欺骗了几个孤儿，干了不少伤天害理的事，几乎在西班牙所有法院都挂了号。最后，他引退在这座城堡里，靠自己和别人的钱过日子，还接待各种各样的游侠骑士。这纯粹是出于对骑士的热爱，同时也希望骑士们分些财产给他，作为对其好心的报酬。</p> 
<p>①骑士受封前应在教堂守夜，看护甲胄。</p> 
<p>②塞万提斯在这里列数了西班牙地痞、流浪汉的集中地。</p> 
<p>他还说，城堡里没有用以守夜看护甲胄的小教堂。原来的小教堂已经拆了，准备盖新的。不过，如果需要的话，他知道，随便在什么地方都可以守夜。那天晚上，他可以在城堡的院子里守夜，待第二天早晨，有上帝为证，举行适当仪式，他就被封为骑士了，而且是世界上最标准的骑士。</p> 
<p>店主问他是否带了钱。唐吉诃德说身无分文，因为他从未在骑士小说里看到某位游侠骑士还带钱。</p> 
<p>店主说，他搞错了。骑士小说里没写带钱是因为作者认为，像带钱和干净的衬衣这类再明白不过的事情就不必写了，可不能因此就认为他们没带钱和衬衣。他肯定，所有游侠骑士（把那么多书都塞得满满当当的）都是腰缠万贯，以防万一。此外，他们还带着衬衣和一个装满创伤药膏的小盒子，因为并不是每次在野外或沙漠发生格斗时受了伤都有人医治的，也没有英明的魔法师朋友乘云托来一位少女或侏儒，送来神水，那水功力之大，骑士只要喝一滴，伤口立刻痊愈，恢复如初。所以，过去的骑士都让侍从带着钱和其他必需品，如纱布、药膏。有的骑士没有侍从（这种情况不多，很少见），他就自己把所有东西都装在几个精巧的褡裢里，挂在马屁股上。褡裢很小，几乎看不见，似乎里面装有其他更重要的东西。如果不是上述情况，带褡裢的方式一般不大为骑士们所接受。所以，店主劝导他（现在他可以像对待教子一般对他讲话，因为他一会儿就要做教父了），以后出门不要忘了带钱和其他备用品，他将会看到带着这些东西是多么有用，至少得这么想。</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德答应按照店主的劝导一一照办。店主又让他到客店一侧的大院子里去看护甲胄。唐吉诃德收拾好全副甲胄，放在一个水井旁的水槽上，然后手持皮盾，拿着长矛，煞有介事地在水槽前巡视。此刻已是垂暮之时。</p> 
<p>店主把他如何发疯，要看护甲胄，等待受封为骑士的事都告诉客店里所有的人。大家对他这种奇特的发神经方式感到惊诧，纷纷从远处张望。大家看到他举止安祥，忽而来回巡视，忽而靠在长矛上，长时间盯着甲胄。暮色已完全降临，然而皓月当空，犹如白昼，这位新骑士的一举一动大家都看得清清楚楚。这时，一位住宿的脚夫忽然想起要去打水饮马，这就得把唐吉诃德放在水槽上的甲胄拿下来。唐吉诃德看到脚夫走来，便高声说道：</p> 
<p>“喂，你，大胆的骑士，无论你是谁，要是想来动这位最勇敢可是从未动武的勇士的甲胄，就小心点儿！你要是不想为你的莽撞丢命的话，就别去碰它！”</p> 
<p>脚夫并没有从他这番话里觉悟过来（要是觉悟过来就好了，那就可以安全无事），却抓起甲胄的皮带，把甲胄扔得老远。这被唐吉诃德看见了。他仰望天空，心念（他觉得心里在念）他的情人杜尔西内亚，说：</p> 
<p>“我的心上人，当第一次凌辱降临到这个已经归附你的胸膛的时候，请助我矣！请你在我的第一次战斗中不吝恩泽与保佑！”</p> 
<p>说完这些和其它诸如此类的话，他放下皮盾，双手举起长矛，这次对着脚夫的脑袋奋力一击，把脚夫打翻在地。脚夫头破血流，如果再挨第二下，就不用请外科医生了。唐吉诃德打完后，收拾好甲胄，又像开始那样安祥地巡视起来。</p> 
<p>过了一会儿，又来了一个脚夫。他并不知道已经发生的事情（那个脚夫还未苏醒），准备打水饮骡子。他刚要挪开甲胄，腾出水槽，唐吉诃德二话不说，也不请谁保佑，就又拿起皮盾，举起长矛，这次倒是没把第二个脚夫的脑袋打碎，只是打成了三瓣还多——一共四瓣。听到声音，客店里所有的人都赶来了，包括店主在内。看到这种情况，唐吉诃德又拿起皮盾，扶剑说道：</p> 
<p>“哦，美丽的心上人，我这颗脆弱的心灵的勇气和力量！被你征服的骑士正面临巨大的险恶，现在是你回首垂眸的时刻了！”</p> 
<p>他似乎由此获得了非凡的力量，即使全世界的脚夫向他进攻，他也不会后退。脚夫的伙伴们从远处用乱石袭击唐吉诃德，他只能用皮盾尽力抵挡，却不敢离开水槽，怕他的甲胄失去保护。店主大声呼喊那些扔石头的人赶紧住手，因为已经告诉过他们，唐吉诃德是个疯子，所以，即使他把那些人都杀了，也不会受到制裁的。唐吉诃德喊的声音更大。他把那些人叫作叛逆，还说城堡长官是个坏骑士，竟然纵容他们这样对待游侠骑士。要是他已经接受了店主授予的骑士称号，决不会轻饶这个背信弃义的臭店主。“至于你们这些卑鄙下流的家伙，我并不理会你们。你们扔吧，来吧，使出你们的全部本事攻击我吧。你们如此愚妄，看着吧，一定会得到报应！”</p> 
<p>他的威严震慑了那些攻击他的人，再加上店主的劝阻，那些人不扔石头了。于是，唐吉诃德也允许他们把受伤的人抬走，然后继续安然地看护甲胄。</p> 
<p>店主觉得这位客人的胡闹太不像话，决走趁着还没有再出乱子，尽快授予他那个晦气的骑士称号。店主找到唐吉诃德，为那些蠢人对他的无礼行为表示歉意，说他自己事先对此事一无所知，而且那些人也由于他们的愚蠢行为受到了惩罚。店主说原来已讲过，城堡里没有小教堂，所以其它的形式也就不必要了。根据自己对授衔仪式所知，最重要的就是击颈击背，而这在田野里也可以进行，更何况他早已达到了看护甲胄的要求。本来，看护两个小时就足够了，而他已经看护了四个小时。</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德信以为真，说他悉心遵命，以便尽快完成仪式。受封以后如果再受到攻击，他不会让城堡里留下活人，除非是长官关照的那些人。出于对长官的尊敬，他将饶那些人一命。这位城堡长官听了这话后不寒而栗。他让人马上找来一本记着他给脚夫多少麦稭和大麦的帐博，让一个男孩拿来一截蜡烛头，再带上那两位女子，来到唐吉诃德面前，命他跪下，然后念手中那本帐簿（就好像在虔诚地祷告）。念到一半时，店主抬起手，在唐吉诃德的颈部一记猛击，然后又用唐吉诃德的剑在他背上轻轻一拍，嘴里始终念念有词。然后，店主命令一个女子向唐吉诃德授剑。那个女子做得既利索又谨慎，因为她们必须注意，在举行仪式的整个过程中不至于大笑起来。她们曾目睹新骑士的英勇行为，终于没敢笑出来。授剑后，一位贵女子说：</p> 
<p>“上帝保佑你成为幸运大骑士，在战斗中为你赐福。”</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德问她叫什么，为的是永远记住应该向谁报恩。他想把将来靠自己臂膀的力量获得的荣誉分给她一份。女子非常谦恭地回答说，她叫托洛萨，是托莱多一位修鞋匠的女儿，住在桑乔·别纳亚的那些小铺附近。还说无论在什么地方，她都愿意侍候他，把他奉为主人。唐吉诃德说，出于爱，他赐予她“唐”称①，从那以后她就叫唐娜托洛萨。她答应了。另一名女子为他套上马刺，唐吉诃德又把同授剑女子说的那套话对她说了一遍。问她姓名，她说叫莫利内拉，父亲是安特奎拉一位有威望的磨坊主。她也请求唐吉诃德赐予她“唐”称，叫唐娜莫利内拉，以后会为他效劳尽力。仪式以前所未有的快速结束之后，唐吉诃德迫不及待地要飞马出去征险。备好罗西南多后，他骑上马，拥抱店主，感谢店主恩赐他骑士称号，说了些莫名其妙的话，无法转述。店主看到他已出客店门，便用同样华丽却又简单得多的话语回答他，也没向他索要住宿费，就让他欢天喜地地走了。</p> 
<p>①西班牙的尊称。对男称“唐”，对女称“唐娜”。</p>
