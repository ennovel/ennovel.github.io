Shortly afterwards Don Quixote perceived a man on horseback who wore on his head something that shone like gold, and the moment he saw him he turned to Sancho and said:</p> 
<p>“I think, Sancho, there is no proverb that is not true, all being maxims drawn from experience itself, the mother of all the sciences, especially that one that says, ‘Where one door shuts, another opens.’ I say so because if last night fortune shut the door of the adventure we were looking for against us, cheating us with the fulling mills, it now opens wide another one for another better and more certain adventure, and if I do not contrive to enter it, it will be my own fault, and I cannot lay it to my ignorance of fulling mills, or the darkness of the night. I say this because, if I mistake not, there comes towards us one who wears on his head the helmet of Mambrino, concerning which I took the oath thou rememberest.”</p> 
<p>“Mind what you say, your worship, and still more what you do,” said Sancho, “for I don’t want any more fulling mills to finish off fulling and knocking our senses out.”</p> 
<p>“The devil take thee, man,” said Don Quixote; “what has a helmet to do with fulling mills?”</p> 
<p>“I don’t know,” replied Sancho, “but, faith, if I might speak as I used, perhaps I could give such reasons that your worship would see you were mistaken in what you say.”</p> 
<p>“How can I be mistaken in what I say, unbelieving traitor?” returned Don Quixote; “tell me, seest thou not yonder knight coming towards us on a dappled grey steed, who has upon his head a helmet of gold?”</p> 
<p>“What I see and make out,” answered Sancho, “is only a man on a grey ass like my own, who has something that shines on his head.”</p> 
<p>“Well, that is the helmet of Mambrino,” said Don Quixote; “stand to one side and leave me alone with him; thou shalt see how, without saying a word, to save time, I shall bring this adventure to an issue and possess myself of the helmet I have so longed for.”</p> 
<p>“I will take care to stand aside,” said Sancho; “but God grant, I say once more, that it may be marjoram and not fulling mills.”</p> 
<p>“I have told thee, brother, on no account to mention those fulling mills to me again,” said Don Quixote, “or I vow — and I say no more — I’ll full the soul out of you.”</p> 
<p>Sancho held his peace in dread lest his master should carry out the vow he had hurled like a bowl at him.</p> 
<p>The fact of the matter as regards the helmet, steed, and knight that Don Quixote saw, was this. In that neighbourhood there were two villages, one of them so small that it had neither apothecary’s shop nor barber, which the other that was close to it had, so the barber of the larger served the smaller, and in it there was a sick man who required to be bled and another man who wanted to be shaved, and on this errand the barber was going, carrying with him a brass basin; but as luck would have it, as he was on the way it began to rain, and not to spoil his hat, which probably was a new one, he put the basin on his head, and being clean it glittered at half a league’s distance. He rode upon a grey ass, as Sancho said, and this was what made it seem to Don Quixote to be a dapple-grey steed and a knight and a golden helmet; for everything he saw he made to fall in with his crazy chivalry and ill-errant notions; and when he saw the poor knight draw near, without entering into any parley with him, at Rocinante’s top speed he bore down upon him with the pike pointed low, fully determined to run him through and through, and as he reached him, without checking the fury of his charge, he cried to him:</p> 
<p>“Defend thyself, miserable being, or yield me of thine own accord that which is so reasonably my due.”</p> 
<p>The barber, who without any expectation or apprehension of it saw this apparition coming down upon him, had no other way of saving himself from the stroke of the lance but to let himself fall off his ass; and no sooner had he touched the ground than he sprang up more nimbly than a deer and sped away across the plain faster than the wind.</p> 
<p>He left the basin on the ground, with which Don Quixote contented himself, saying that the pagan had shown his discretion and imitated the beaver, which finding itself pressed by the hunters bites and cuts off with its teeth that for which, by its natural instinct, it knows it is pursued.</p> 
<p>He told Sancho to pick up the helmet, and he taking it in his hands said:</p> 
<p>“By God the basin is a good one, and worth a real of eight if it is worth a maravedis,” and handed it to his master, who immediately put it on his head, turning it round, now this way, now that, in search of fitment, and not finding it he said, “Clearly the pagan to whose measure this famous head-piece was first forged must have had a very large head; but the worst of it is half of it is wanting.”</p> 
<p>When Sancho heard him call the basin a headpiece he was unable to restrain his laughter, but remembering his master’s wrath he checked himself in the midst of it.</p> 
<p>“What art thou laughing at, Sancho?” said Don Quixote.</p> 
<p>“I am laughing,” said he, “to think of the great head the pagan must have had who owned this helmet, for it looks exactly like a regular barber’s basin.”</p> 
<p>“Dost thou know what I suspect, Sancho?” said Don Quixote; “that this wonderful piece of this enchanted helmet must by some strange accident have come into the hands of some one who was unable to recognise or realise its value, and who, not knowing what he did, and seeing it to be of the purest gold, must have melted down one half for the sake of what it might be worth, and of the other made this which is like a barber’s basin as thou sayest; but be it as it may, to me who recognise it, its transformation makes no difference, for I will set it to rights at the first village where there is a blacksmith, and in such style that that helmet the god of smithies forged for the god of battles shall not surpass it or even come up to it; and in the meantime I will wear it as well as I can, for something is better than nothing; all the more as it will be quite enough to protect me from any chance blow of a stone.”</p> 
<p>“That is,” said Sancho, “if it is not shot with a sling as they were in the battle of the two armies, when they signed the cross on your worship’s grinders and smashed the flask with that blessed draught that made me vomit my bowels up.”</p> 
<p>“It does not grieve me much to have lost it,” said Don Quixote, “for thou knowest, Sancho, that I have the receipt in my memory.”</p> 
<p>“So have I,” answered Sancho, “but if ever I make it, or try it again as long as I live, may this be my last hour; moreover, I have no intention of putting myself in the way of wanting it, for I mean, with all my five senses, to keep myself from being wounded or from wounding anyone: as to being blanketed again I say nothing, for it is hard to prevent mishaps of that sort, and if they come there is nothing for it but to squeeze our shoulders together, hold our breath, shut our eyes, and let ourselves go where luck and the blanket may send us.”</p> 
<p>“Thou art a bad Christian, Sancho,” said Don Quixote on hearing this, “for once an injury has been done thee thou never forgettest it: but know that it is the part of noble and generous hearts not to attach importance to trifles. What lame leg hast thou got by it, what broken rib, what cracked head, that thou canst not forget that jest? For jest and sport it was, properly regarded, and had I not seen it in that light I would have returned and done more mischief in revenging thee than the Greeks did for the rape of Helen, who, if she were alive now, or if my Dulcinea had lived then, might depend upon it she would not be so famous for her beauty as she is;” and here he heaved a sigh and sent it aloft; and said Sancho, “Let it pass for a jest as it cannot be revenged in earnest, but I know what sort of jest and earnest it was, and I know it will never be rubbed out of my memory any more than off my shoulders. But putting that aside, will your worship tell me what are we to do with this dapple-grey steed that looks like a grey ass, which that Martino that your worship overthrew has left deserted here? for, from the way he took to his heels and bolted, he is not likely ever to come back for it; and by my beard but the grey is a good one.”</p> 
<p>“I have never been in the habit,” said Don Quixote, “of taking spoil of those whom I vanquish, nor is it the practice of chivalry to take away their horses and leave them to go on foot, unless indeed it be that the victor have lost his own in the combat, in which case it is lawful to take that of the vanquished as a thing won in lawful war; therefore, Sancho, leave this horse, or ass, or whatever thou wilt have it to be; for when its owner sees us gone hence he will come back for it.”</p> 
<p>“God knows I should like to take it,” returned Sancho, “or at least to change it for my own, which does not seem to me as good a one: verily the laws of chivalry are strict, since they cannot be stretched to let one ass be changed for another; I should like to know if I might at least change trappings.”</p> 
<p>“On that head I am not quite certain,” answered Don Quixote, “and the matter being doubtful, pending better information, I say thou mayest change them, if so be thou hast urgent need of them.”</p> 
<p>“So urgent is it,” answered Sancho, “that if they were for my own person I could not want them more;” and forthwith, fortified by this licence, he effected the mutatio capparum, rigging out his beast to the ninety-nines and making quite another thing of it. This done, they broke their fast on the remains of the spoils of war plundered from the sumpter mule, and drank of the brook that flowed from the fulling mills, without casting a look in that direction, in such loathing did they hold them for the alarm they had caused them; and, all anger and gloom removed, they mounted and, without taking any fixed road (not to fix upon any being the proper thing for true knights-errant), they set out, guided by Rocinante’s will, which carried along with it that of his master, not to say that of the ass, which always followed him wherever he led, lovingly and sociably; nevertheless they returned to the high road, and pursued it at a venture without any other aim.</p> 
<p>As they went along, then, in this way Sancho said to his master, “Senor, would your worship give me leave to speak a little to you? For since you laid that hard injunction of silence on me several things have gone to rot in my stomach, and I have now just one on the tip of my tongue that I don’t want to be spoiled.”</p> 
<p>“Say, on, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “and be brief in thy discourse, for there is no pleasure in one that is long.”</p> 
<p>“Well then, senor,” returned Sancho, “I say that for some days past I have been considering how little is got or gained by going in search of these adventures that your worship seeks in these wilds and cross-roads, where, even if the most perilous are victoriously achieved, there is no one to see or know of them, and so they must be left untold for ever, to the loss of your worship’s object and the credit they deserve; therefore it seems to me it would be better (saving your worship’s better judgment) if we were to go and serve some emperor or other great prince who may have some war on hand, in whose service your worship may prove the worth of your person, your great might, and greater understanding, on perceiving which the lord in whose service we may be will perforce have to reward us, each according to his merits; and there you will not be at a loss for some one to set down your achievements in writing so as to preserve their memory for ever. Of my own I say nothing, as they will not go beyond squirely limits, though I make bold to say that, if it be the practice in chivalry to write the achievements of squires, I think mine must not be left out.”</p> 
<p>“Thou speakest not amiss, Sancho,” answered Don Quixote, “but before that point is reached it is requisite to roam the world, as it were on probation, seeking adventures, in order that, by achieving some, name and fame may be acquired, such that when he betakes himself to the court of some great monarch the knight may be already known by his deeds, and that the boys, the instant they see him enter the gate of the city, may all follow him and surround him, crying, ‘This is the Knight of the Sun’-or the Serpent, or any other title under which he may have achieved great deeds. ‘This,’ they will say, ‘is he who vanquished in single combat the gigantic Brocabruno of mighty strength; he who delivered the great Mameluke of Persia out of the long enchantment under which he had been for almost nine hundred years.’ So from one to another they will go proclaiming his achievements; and presently at the tumult of the boys and the others the king of that kingdom will appear at the windows of his royal palace, and as soon as he beholds the knight, recognising him by his arms and the device on his shield, he will as a matter of course say, ‘What ho! Forth all ye, the knights of my court, to receive the flower of chivalry who cometh hither!’ At which command all will issue forth, and he himself, advancing half-way down the stairs, will embrace him closely, and salute him, kissing him on the cheek, and will then lead him to the queen’s chamber, where the knight will find her with the princess her daughter, who will be one of the most beautiful and accomplished damsels that could with the utmost pains be discovered anywhere in the known world. Straightway it will come to pass that she will fix her eyes upon the knight and he his upon her, and each will seem to the other something more divine than human, and, without knowing how or why they will be taken and entangled in the inextricable toils of love, and sorely distressed in their hearts not to see any way of making their pains and sufferings known by speech. Thence they will lead him, no doubt, to some richly adorned chamber of the palace, where, having removed his armour, they will bring him a rich mantle of scarlet wherewith to robe himself, and if he looked noble in his armour he will look still more so in a doublet. When night comes he will sup with the king, queen, and princess; and all the time he will never take his eyes off her, stealing stealthy glances, unnoticed by those present, and she will do the same, and with equal cautiousness, being, as I have said, a damsel of great discretion. The tables being removed, suddenly through the door of the hall there will enter a hideous and diminutive dwarf followed by a fair dame, between two giants, who comes with a certain adventure, the work of an ancient sage; and he who shall achieve it shall be deemed the best knight in the world.</p> 
<p>“The king will then command all those present to essay it, and none will bring it to an end and conclusion save the stranger knight, to the great enhancement of his fame, whereat the princess will be overjoyed and will esteem herself happy and fortunate in having fixed and placed her thoughts so high. And the best of it is that this king, or prince, or whatever he is, is engaged in a very bitter war with another as powerful as himself, and the stranger knight, after having been some days at his court, requests leave from him to go and serve him in the said war. The king will grant it very readily, and the knight will courteously kiss his hands for the favour done to him; and that night he will take leave of his lady the princess at the grating of the chamber where she sleeps, which looks upon a garden, and at which he has already many times conversed with her, the go-between and confidante in the matter being a damsel much trusted by the princess. He will sigh, she will swoon, the damsel will fetch water, much distressed because morning approaches, and for the honour of her lady he would not that they were discovered; at last the princess will come to herself and will present her white hands through the grating to the knight, who will kiss them a thousand and a thousand times, bathing them with his tears. It will be arranged between them how they are to inform each other of their good or evil fortunes, and the princess will entreat him to make his absence as short as possible, which he will promise to do with many oaths; once more he kisses her hands, and takes his leave in such grief that he is well-nigh ready to die. He betakes him thence to his chamber, flings himself on his bed, cannot sleep for sorrow at parting, rises early in the morning, goes to take leave of the king, queen, and princess, and, as he takes his leave of the pair, it is told him that the princess is indisposed and cannot receive a visit; the knight thinks it is from grief at his departure, his heart is pierced, and he is hardly able to keep from showing his pain. The confidante is present, observes all, goes to tell her mistress, who listens with tears and says that one of her greatest distresses is not knowing who this knight is, and whether he is of kingly lineage or not; the damsel assures her that so much courtesy, gentleness, and gallantry of bearing as her knight possesses could not exist in any save one who was royal and illustrious; her anxiety is thus relieved, and she strives to be of good cheer lest she should excite suspicion in her parents, and at the end of two days she appears in public. Meanwhile the knight has taken his departure; he fights in the war, conquers the king’s enemy, wins many cities, triumphs in many battles, returns to the court, sees his lady where he was wont to see her, and it is agreed that he shall demand her in marriage of her parents as the reward of his services; the king is unwilling to give her, as he knows not who he is, but nevertheless, whether carried off or in whatever other way it may be, the princess comes to be his bride, and her father comes to regard it as very good fortune; for it so happens that this knight is proved to be the son of a valiant king of some kingdom, I know not what, for I fancy it is not likely to be on the map. The father dies, the princess inherits, and in two words the knight becomes king. And here comes in at once the bestowal of rewards upon his squire and all who have aided him in rising to so exalted a rank. He marries his squire to a damsel of the princess’s , who will be, no doubt, the one who was confidante in their amour, and is daughter of a very great duke.”</p> 
<p>“That’s what I want, and no mistake about it!” said Sancho. “That’s what I’m waiting for; for all this, word for word, is in store for your worship under the title of the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.”</p> 
<p>“Thou needst not doubt it, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “for in the same manner, and by the same steps as I have described here, knights-errant rise and have risen to be kings and emperors; all we want now is to find out what king, Christian or pagan, is at war and has a beautiful daughter; but there will be time enough to think of that, for, as I have told thee, fame must be won in other quarters before repairing to the court. There is another thing, too, that is wanting; for supposing we find a king who is at war and has a beautiful daughter, and that I have won incredible fame throughout the universe, I know not how it can be made out that I am of royal lineage, or even second cousin to an emperor; for the king will not be willing to give me his daughter in marriage unless he is first thoroughly satisfied on this point, however much my famous deeds may deserve it; so that by this deficiency I fear I shall lose what my arm has fairly earned. True it is I am a gentleman of known house, of estate and property, and entitled to the five hundred sueldos mulct; and it may be that the sage who shall write my history will so clear up my ancestry and pedigree that I may find myself fifth or sixth in descent from a king; for I would have thee know, Sancho, that there are two kinds of lineages in the world; some there be tracing and deriving their descent from kings and princes, whom time has reduced little by little until they end in a point like a pyramid upside down; and others who spring from the common herd and go on rising step by step until they come to be great lords; so that the difference is that the one were what they no longer are, and the others are what they formerly were not. And I may be of such that after investigation my origin may prove great and famous, with which the king, my father-in-law that is to be, ought to be satisfied; and should he not be, the princess will so love me that even though she well knew me to be the son of a water-carrier, she will take me for her lord and husband in spite of her father; if not, then it comes to seizing her and carrying her off where I please; for time or death will put an end to the wrath of her parents.”</p> 
<p>“It comes to this, too,” said Sancho, “what some naughty people say, ‘Never ask as a favour what thou canst take by force;’ though it would fit better to say, ‘A clear escape is better than good men’s prayers.’ I say so because if my lord the king, your worship’s father-in-law, will not condescend to give you my lady the princess, there is nothing for it but, as your worship says, to seize her and transport her. But the mischief is that until peace is made and you come into the peaceful enjoyment of your kingdom, the poor squire is famishing as far as rewards go, unless it be that the confidante damsel that is to be his wife comes with the princess, and that with her he tides over his bad luck until Heaven otherwise orders things; for his master, I suppose, may as well give her to him at once for a lawful wife.”</p> 
<p>“Nobody can object to that,” said Don Quixote.</p> 
<p>“Then since that may be,” said Sancho, “there is nothing for it but to commend ourselves to God, and let fortune take what course it will.”</p> 
<p>“God guide it according to my wishes and thy wants,” said Don Quixote, “and mean be he who thinks himself mean.”</p> 
<p>“In God’s name let him be so,” said Sancho: “I am an old Christian, and to fit me for a count that’s enough.”</p> 
<p>“And more than enough for thee,” said Don Quixote; “and even wert thou not, it would make no difference, because I being the king can easily give thee nobility without purchase or service rendered by thee, for when I make thee a count, then thou art at once a gentleman; and they may say what they will, but by my faith they will have to call thee ‘your lordship,’ whether they like it or not.”</p> 
<p>“Not a doubt of it; and I’ll know how to support the tittle,” said Sancho.</p> 
<p>“Title thou shouldst say, not tittle,” said his master.</p> 
<p>“So be it,” answered Sancho. “I say I will know how to behave, for once in my life I was beadle of a brotherhood, and the beadle’s gown sat so well on me that all said I looked as if I was to be steward of the same brotherhood. What will it be, then, when I put a duke’s robe on my back, or dress myself in gold and pearls like a count? I believe they’ll come a hundred leagues to see me.”</p> 
<p>“Thou wilt look well,” said Don Quixote, “but thou must shave thy beard often, for thou hast it so thick and rough and unkempt, that if thou dost not shave it every second day at least, they will see what thou art at the distance of a musket shot.”</p> 
<p>“What more will it be,” said Sancho, “than having a barber, and keeping him at wages in the house? and even if it be necessary, I will make him go behind me like a nobleman’s equerry.”</p> 
<p>“Why, how dost thou know that noblemen have equerries behind them?” asked Don Quixote.</p> 
<p>“I will tell you,” answered Sancho. “Years ago I was for a month at the capital and there I saw taking the air a very small gentleman who they said was a very great man, and a man following him on horseback in every turn he took, just as if he was his tail. I asked why this man did not join the other man, instead of always going behind him; they answered me that he was his equerry, and that it was the custom with nobles to have such persons behind them, and ever since then I know it, for I have never forgotten it.”</p> 
<p>“Thou art right,” said Don Quixote, “and in the same way thou mayest carry thy barber with thee, for customs did not come into use all together, nor were they all invented at once, and thou mayest be the first count to have a barber to follow him; and, indeed, shaving one’s beard is a greater trust than saddling one’s horse.”</p> 
<p>“Let the barber business be my look-out,” said Sancho; “and your worship’s be it to strive to become a king, and make me a count.”</p> 
<p>“So it shall be,” answered Don Quixote, and raising his eyes he saw what will be told in the following chapter.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>赢得了曼布里诺头盔及其他事</p> 
<p>这时下起了小雨。桑乔想两人一起到砑布机作坊里去避雨。刚刚闹了个大笑话，所以，唐吉诃德对这个砑布机感到厌恶，不想进去。于是两人拐上右边的一条路，同他们前几天走的那条路一样。没走多远，唐吉诃德就发现一个骑马的人，头上戴个闪闪发光的东西，好像是金的。唐吉诃德立刻转过身来对桑乔说：</p> 
<p>“依我看，桑乔，俗话句句真，因为它是经验的总结。而经验是各种知识之母。特别是那句：‘此门不开那门开’。我是说，昨天晚上，命运用砑布机欺骗咱们，把咱们要找的门堵死了。可现在，另一扇门却大开，为咱们准备了更大更艰巨的凶险。这回如果我不进去，那就是我的错，也不用怨什么砑布机或者黑天了。假如我没弄错的话，迎面来了一个人，头上戴着曼布里诺的头盔。我曾发誓要得到它，这你知道。”</p> 
<p>“那个东西您可得看清楚，”桑乔说，“但愿别又是一些刺激咱们感官的砑布机。”</p> 
<p>“你这家伙，”唐吉诃德说，“头盔跟砑布机有什么关系！”</p> 
<p>“我什么也不懂，”桑乔说，“可我要是能像过去一样多嘴的话，我肯定能讲出许多道理来，证明您说错了。”</p> 
<p>“我怎么会说错呢，放肆的叛徒！”唐吉诃德说，“你说，你没看见那个向我们走来的骑士骑着一匹花斑灰马，头上还戴着金头盔吗？”</p> 
<p>“我看见的似乎是一个骑着棕驴的人，那驴同我的驴一样，他头上戴着个闪闪发光的东西。”</p> 
<p>“那就是曼布里诺的头盔。”唐吉诃德说，“你站到一边去，让我一个人对付他。你会看到，为了节省时间，我一言不发就能结束这场战斗，得到我盼望已久的头盔。”</p> 
<p>“我会小心退到一旁，”桑乔说，“上帝保佑，我再说一遍，但愿那是牛至①，而不是砑布机。”</p> 
<p>①牛至是一种植物。西班牙谚语：“牛至不会遍山岗，世上不会皆坦途。”</p> 
<p>“我说过了，兄弟，你别再提，我也不再想什么砑布机了。”唐吉诃德说，“我发誓……我不说什么了，让你的灵魂去捶你吧。”</p> 
<p>桑乔怕主人不履行对他发过的誓言，便缩成一团，不再作声了。</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德看到的头盔、马和骑士原来是下面这么回事：那一带有两个地方。一个地方很小，连药铺和理发店也没有。而旁边另一个地方就有。于是大地方的理发师①也到小地方来干活。小地方有个病人要抽血，还有个人要理发。理发师就是为此而来的，还带了个铜盆。他来的时候不巧下雨了。理发师的帽子大概是新的。他不想把帽子弄脏，就把铜盆扣在头上。那盆还挺干净，离着半里远就能看见它发亮。理发师就像桑乔说的，骑着一头棕驴。这就是唐吉诃德说的花斑灰马、骑士和金盔。唐吉诃德看到那些东西，很容易按照他的疯狂的骑士意识和怪念头加以想象。看到那个骑马人走近了，他二话不说，提矛催马向前冲去，想把那人扎个透心凉。冲到那人跟前时，他并没有减速，只是对那人喊道：</p> 
<p>“看矛，卑鄙的家伙，要不就心甘情愿地把本应该属于我的东西献出来！”</p> 
<p>①当时的风俗，理发师往往以医疗为副业。</p> 
<p>理发师万万没有想到，也没有提防会有这么个怪人向他冲过来。为了躲过长矛，他只好翻身从驴背上滚下来。刚一落地，他又像鹿一样敏捷地跳起身，在原野上跑起来，速度快得风犹不及。理发师把铜盆丢在了地上，唐吉诃德见了很高兴，说这个家伙还算聪明，他学了海狸的做法。海狸在被猎人追赶的时候会用牙齿咬断它那个东西。它凭本能知道，人们追的是它那个东西。唐吉诃德让桑乔把头盔捡起来交给他。</p> 
<p>桑乔捧着铜盆说：</p> 
<p>“我向上帝保证，这个铜盆质量不错，值一枚八雷阿尔的银币。”</p> 
<p>桑乔把铜盆交给主人。唐吉诃德把它扣在自己脑袋上，转来转去找盔顶，结果找不到，便说：</p> 
<p>“这个著名的头盔当初一定是按照那个倒霉鬼的脑袋尺寸造的。那家伙的脑袋一定很大。糟糕的是这个头盔只有一半。”</p> 
<p>桑乔听到唐吉诃德把铜盆叫作头盔，忍不住笑了。可他忽然想起了主人的脾气，笑到一半就止住了。</p> 
<p>“你笑什么，桑乔？”唐吉诃德问。</p> 
<p>“我笑这个头盔的倒霉主人的脑袋竟有这么大。”桑乔说，“这倒像个理发师的铜盆。”</p> 
<p>“你猜我怎么想，桑乔？这个著名的头盔大概曾意外地落到过一个不识货、也不懂得它的价值的人手里。那人不知道这是干什么用的，看到铜很纯，就把那一半熔化了，卖点钱。剩下的这一半就像你说的，像个理发师用的铜盆。不管怎么样，我识货，不在乎它是否走了样。回头找到有铜匠的地方，我就把它收拾一下，哪怕收拾得并不比铁神为战神造的那个头盔好，甚至还不如它。我凑合着戴，有总比没有强，而且，对付石头击打还是挺管用。”</p> 
<p>“那石头只要不是用弹弓打来的就行，”桑乔说，“可别像上次两军交战时那样崩掉了您的牙，还把那个装圣水的瓶子打碎了，那圣水让我差点儿把五脏六腑都吐出来。”</p> 
<p>“那圣水没了，我一点也不可惜。你知道，桑乔，它的配方我都记在脑子里了。”唐吉诃德说。</p> 
<p>“我也记得，”桑乔说，“可是如果我这辈子再做一回并再喝一回那种圣水，我马上就完蛋了。而且，我不想弄到需要喝那种水的地步。我要全力以赴，防止受伤，也不伤害别人。我不想再被人用被单扔，这种倒霉的事情可以避免。可是如果真的再被扔，我也只好抱紧肩膀，屏住呼吸，听天由命，让被单随便折腾吧。”</p> 
<p>“你不是个好基督徒，桑乔，”唐吉诃德闻言说道，“一次受辱竟终生不忘。你该知道，宽广的胸怀不在乎这些枝节小事。你是少了条腿，断了根肋骨，还是脑袋开花了，以至于对那个玩笑念念不忘？事后看，那完全是逗着玩呢。我如果不这样认为，早就去替你报仇了，准比对那些劫持了海伦的希腊人还要狠。海伦要是处在现在这个时代，或者我的杜尔西内亚处在海伦那个时代，海伦的美貌肯定不会有现在这么大名气。”</p> 
<p>唐吉诃德说到此长叹一声。桑乔说：</p> 
<p>“就当是逗着玩吧，反正又不能真去报仇。不过，我知道什么是动真格的，什么是逗着玩。我还知道它永远不会从我的记忆里抹去，就像不能从我的背上抹去一样。还是别说这个了。您告诉我，那个马蒂诺①被您打败了，他丢下的这匹似棕驴的花斑灰马怎么办？看那人逃之夭夭的样子，估计他不会再回来找了。我凭我的胡子发誓，这真是匹好灰马呀。”</p> 
<p>①桑乔把曼布里诺说错成马蒂诺了。</p> 
<p>“我从不习惯占有被我打败的那些人的东西，”唐吉诃德说，“而且夺取他们的马，让他们步行，这也不符合骑士的习惯，除非是战胜者在战斗中失去了自己的马。只有在这种情况下，作为正当的战利品，夺取战败者的马才算合法。所以，桑乔，你放了那匹马或那头驴，随便你愿意把它当成什么吧。</p> 
<p>它的主人看见咱们离开这儿，就会回来找它。”</p> 
<p>“上帝知道，我想带走它，”桑乔说，“至少跟我这头驴换一换。我觉得我这头驴并不怎么好。骑士规则还真严，连换头驴都不让。我想知道是否连马具都不让换。”</p> 
<p>“这点我不很清楚，”唐吉诃德说，“既然遇到了疑问，又没有答案，如果你特别需要，我看就先换吧。”</p> 
<p>“太需要了，”桑乔说，“对于我来说，这是再需要不过的了。”</p> 
<p>既然得到了允许，桑乔马上来了个交换仪式，然后把他的驴打扮一番，比原来漂亮了好几倍。从教士那儿夺来的骡子背上还有些干粮，他们吃了，又背向砑布机，喝了点旁边小溪里的水。砑布机曾经把他们吓得够呛。他们已经讨厌砑布机，不想再看见它了。</p> 
<p>喝了点凉水，也就没什么可忧虑的了。两人上了马，漫无方向地（游侠骑士之根本就是漫无目的）上了路，任凭罗西南多随意走。主人随它意，那头驴也听它的，亲亲热热地在后面跟着。罗西南多走到哪儿，那头驴就跟到哪儿。最后他们还是回到了大路，毫无目标地沿着大路溜达。</p> 
<p>正走着，桑乔问主人：</p> 
<p>“大人，您准许我同您说几句话吗？自从您下了那道苛刻的命令，不让我多说话后，我有很多东西都烂在肚子里了。现在有件事就在我嘴边上，我不想让它荒废了。”</p> 
<p>“说吧，”唐吉诃德答道，“不过简单些。话一长就没意思了。”</p> 
<p>“我说，大人，”桑乔说，“这几天我一直在想，您在荒野岔口寻险征险，得到的太少了。虽然您克敌制胜，勇排凶险，可是没人看见，也没人知道，恐怕会一辈子无声无息。这就辜负了您的苦心，您也没有得到相应的报答。所以，除非您有更好的主意，我建议咱们去为某个正在交战的皇帝或君主效劳，您可以在那儿显示您的勇气、您的力量和您超人的智力。咱们去投奔的那位大人发现这些之后，就会论功行赏，您的业绩也就会被永远铭记。至于我就不用说了，反正超不出侍从的范围。我敢说，如果骑士小说里少不了写上侍从的功劳，写我的部分也不会超过三行。”</p> 
<p>“你讲得不错，桑乔。”唐吉诃德说，“可是在达到那个地步之前，骑士还是应该四方征险，经受锻炼，待获得几次成功之后，就能声名显赫。那个时候再去觐见朝廷，也算是知名骑士了。小伙子们在城门口一看见他，就会围上来喊‘他就是太阳骑士’，或者‘蛇骑士’，或者功成名就的其它称号的骑士。他们会说：‘就是他战胜了力大无比的巨人布罗卡布鲁诺，解除了横行将近九百年的波斯国马木路克王朝的魔法。’于是他的事迹就传开了。听到小伙子和其他人的喧嚷声，那个王国的国王来到王宫窗前。国王看到了骑士，一眼就从甲胄和盾牌的徽记认出了他。于是国王大声喊道：‘喂，朝廷所有的勇士，都去迎接远道而来的骑士精英呀。’国王一喊，大家都出来了。国王走到台阶上迎接他，紧紧拥抱他，同他行接吻礼，然后拉着他的手，来到后宫。骑士会在后宫碰到公主，她是世界上难得的一位最完美的公主。</p> 
<p>“下面的情况就是，公主看着骑士，骑士也盯着公主的眼睛，两人都认为对方是世界上最神圣的。他们不知道怎么会又怎么不会坠入情网，无以自拔，还为不知怎样说才能表达自己的热望和情感而从内心感到痛苦。骑士肯定会被带到王宫一间布置豪华的房间里，为他脱去甲胄，拿来一件红色的披风。骑士穿戴甲胄时就显得很精神，现在脱去甲胄更显得英俊了。</p> 
<p>“骑士同国王、王后和公主共进晚餐。骑士的眼睛始终没有离开公主，偷偷地看她。公主也同样看着骑士，也是偷偷地瞧，我说过，这是一位很规矩的公主。晚餐快结束的时候，不料，有一个又丑又矮的侏儒从客厅的门口进来，身后还有一个漂亮的女人，由两名巨人左右相伴。那个女人说遇到了一点有关骑士的麻烦事，谁要是能解决，就会被认为是世界上最优秀的骑士。国王吩咐所有在场的人都试试看，结果只有这位骑士客人能够解决，于是他名声更噪。公主对此非常高兴，而且为自己钟情于一位如此高尚的人感到了极大的满足。</p> 
<p>“正巧这位国王或王子或随便他是谁吧，同另一个与他势均力敌的人交战。这位骑士客人在朝廷住了几天之后，就请求允许他在这场战斗中为国王效劳。国王很痛快地答应了，骑士彬彬有礼地吻了国王的手谢恩。当天晚上，骑士隔着花园的栅栏同公主告别，公主的卧室在那个花园里。骑士已经隔着栅栏同公主幽会过多次，都是由公主信任的一个女仆牵线联系的。骑士唉声叹气，公主则晕了过去，女仆端来了水。女仆很着急，因为天快亮了，女仆不愿意事情败露，这会影响公主的声誉。公主醒过来，把两只白皙的手伸给栅栏外的骑士。骑士无数次地吻她的手，以泪洗她的手。两人商定，不管事情是好是坏，都要告诉对方。公主求骑士尽可能早些回来，骑士发誓说一定早回来。骑士又吻她的手，告别时更是难分难舍，差点没死过去。</p> 
<p>“骑士回到自己的房间，躺在床上，离别的痛苦使他难以成眠。他很早就起来向国王、王后和公主告别。同国王和王后告别后，听说公主身体不舒服，不能见他，骑士心如刀割，差点让痛苦在脸上表现出来。那个牵线的女仆当时在场，有所察觉，就把这些情况告诉了公主。公主听后流泪了，对女仆说，她最伤心的一件事就是不知道骑士是否是国王后裔。女仆肯定地说，骑士如果不是国王的后代，就不会那样彬彬有礼，风度翩翩，雄姿英发。公主听到这话放心了。她尽力安慰自己，以免父母看出什么。两天之后，公主又开始露面了。</p> 
<p>“骑士走了。他参加了战斗，打败了国王的敌人，赢得了许多城市，打了很多胜仗。后来他回到朝廷，到与公主常常幽会的地方去找公主，商定要向公主的父亲提亲，以此作为国王对自己的酬报。国王不愿意，因为他不知道骑士的身世。可骑士和公主还是想出了对策，或者靠私奔，或者靠其它什么办法，反正公主成了骑士的夫人。国王也开始觉得这是件好事了，因为他弄清了这个骑士是某个我也不知道叫什么的王国的勇敢国王的儿子，我觉得地图上好像没有那个王国。国王死了，公主承袭王位，骑士转眼间成了国王。于是他开始赏赐他的侍从和所有曾帮助他爬上如此高位的人。他把公主的一个女仆，也就是当初给他们牵线的那个女仆，许配给了他的侍从。那个女仆是一位赫赫有名的公爵的女儿。”</p> 
<p>“我就是要这样的，”桑乔说，“我有话直说，我就是要这样的。而刚才说的这些，您这位猥獕骑士也会遇到。”</p> 
<p>“对此你不必怀疑，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“那些游侠骑士就是按照我刚才说的方式爬上国王或皇帝宝座的。现在要做的就是看看哪个基督教徒或异教徒的国王遇到了战争，而且有个漂亮的女儿。可是，这事还得过一段时间再想。我刚才说过，咱们得先到别处闯出名声，才能有资格到朝廷去。还有一件事：就算是某个国王遇到了战争，他也有个漂亮的女儿，而且我也获得了威振天下的名气，但我不知道怎样才能证明我是国王的后裔，哪怕是国王表兄的后裔呢。如果国王不首先知道这点，我就是战功再卓著，国王也不会让他的女儿嫁给我。我怕因为这个失掉本应该属于我的东西。我的确是名门之后，家里有财产土地，能得到五百苏埃尔多①，说不定撰写我的传记的贤人会查清我的身世，证明我是国王的第五代或第六代重孙。</p> 
<p>①苏埃尔多是西班牙古币名。按照西班牙中世纪法律，对侮辱贵族者可处以五百苏埃尔多的罚款，并将此款交给受辱贵族作为赔偿。</p> 
<p>“我该让你知道，桑乔，世界上有两种身世。一种是帝王君主的后裔，他们慢慢衰落，最后只剩下一个尖了，就像个倒置的金字塔。还有一种是出身卑微，一步一步一直爬到了上等人的地位。这两类人的区别在于一些人过去是，现在不是了，而另一些人现在是，过去不是。我大概属于前一种。查清我属于豪门贵族，国王就高兴了，就会成为我的岳父了。如果不是这样，公主也会对我一往情深。即使她父亲不同意，她也明知我是布衣，她仍然会同意我做她的主人或丈夫。否则我就会把她劫走，带到我愿意去的地方。等过些时候，或者她的父母死了，他们也就不生气了。”</p> 
<p>“在这儿就用上了有些没良心人的话：‘能豪夺者不巧取’。”桑乔说，“不过还有句更合适的话：‘苦苦哀求，莫如溜走’。我这么说是因为万一国王大人，您的岳父，不乖乖地把公主交给您，也只好像您说的那样，把公主劫走或转移掉。不过还有个问题，那就是若在王国里过安分日子，可怜的侍从应该得到恩赐，要不然就让给他们牵线的女仆跟公主一起走。她本来就应该成为侍从的妻子。侍从与女仆患难与共，直到老天开眼。我相信主人最后一定会把女仆赏给侍从做正式妻子。”</p> 
<p>“没人能阻止这事。”唐吉诃德说。</p> 
<p>“倘若如此，”桑乔说，“咱们就求上帝保佑，听天由命吧。”</p> 
<p>“上帝会保佑咱们，”唐吉诃德说，“按照我的愿望和你的情况分别安排的。平民就是平民。”</p> 
<p>“听凭上帝安排吧，”桑乔说，“我是个老基督徒，能当个伯爵就知足了。”</p> 
<p>“这要求已经有些过高了，”唐吉诃德说，“你即使没有成为伯爵，也不要在意。只要我当上国王，完全可以赐给你贵族身份，根本用不着花钱去买或者向我进贡。我让你当伯爵，你就成了贵族，别管人家说什么。他们就是不高兴，也得称你为‘阁下’。”</p> 
<p>“那好哇，我要受封‘嚼位’啦。”桑乔说。</p> 
<p>“应该是‘爵位’而不是‘嚼位’。”唐吉诃德说。</p> 
<p>“就算是吧。”桑乔说，“这我可会安排。我这辈子曾经当过教友会的差役。我穿差役的外衣特别合适，大家都说我完全可以当教友会的总管。我若是像外国的伯爵那样，披着公爵的披风，浑身黄金珠宝该多好哇。我得让大家都看清楚。”</p> 
<p>“那样子一定不错，”唐吉诃德说，“不过你得经常刮胡子。像你这样又浓又密、乱七八糟的胡子，至少每两天就得剪一次。否则离着很远就看到你的胡子了。”</p> 
<p>“家里雇个理发师不就行了吗？”桑乔说，“必要的话，还可以让他跟在我后面，就像个贵族的马夫。”</p> 
<p>“你怎么知道贵族后面总跟着个马夫呢？”唐吉诃德问。</p> 
<p>“我告诉你吧，”桑乔说，“以前我曾在朝廷干过一个月。我在那儿看到一位个子很矮的大人，听说他爵位很高。总有个人骑马跟着他转，像个尾巴。我问为什么那个人不与贵族同行，而是跟在后面。有人告诉我，说那人是贵族的马夫。贵族们身后总是带着个马夫。从那时候起，我就知道了，而且从来没忘过。”</p> 
<p>“说得对，”唐吉诃德说，“你也可以带着你的理发师。习惯不一样，做法也可以不一样。你完全可以成为第一个带理发师的伯爵，况且刮胡子是比备马还贴身的事哩。”</p> 
<p>“理发师的事我来办，”桑乔说，“您就争取做国王，让我当伯爵吧。”</p> 
<p>“会这样的。”唐吉诃德说。</p> 
<p>这时唐吉诃德抬起头，看见了一样东西，究竟是什么，详情见下章。</p>
