The agony of his swollen throat had spread now through his every nerve and fiber, and the act of breathing seemed itself a defiance toward the will of God. His flesh was slick with sweat and sore with fever. Sleep would fall upon him like a heavy shroud, bearing him into blessed insensibility, but while he was awake his vision was as blurred as a candle behind soot-filmed glass. In spite of all these torments, however, the worst was that he was keenly aware of his condition. The deterioration of his body had not yet reached his mind, and thus he had sense enough to realize he was perilously close to the grave's edge.</p><p>"Will you help me turn him overi" Dr. Shields asked Matthew and Mrs. Nettles.</p><p>Matthew hesitated, his own face pallid in the light from a double candleholder to which was fixed a circle of reflective mirror. "What are you going to doi"</p><p>Dr. Shields pushed his spectacles up on the bridge of his nose. "The afflicted blood is pooling in his body, " he answered. "It must be moved. Stirred up from its stagnant ponds, if you will."</p><p>"Stirred upi Howi By more bleedingi"</p><p>"No. I think at this point the lancet will not perform its necessary function."</p><p>"How, theni" Matthew insisted.</p><p>"Mrs. Nettles, " the doctor said curtly, "if you'll please assist mei"</p><p>"Yes sir." She took hold of Woodward's arm and leg on one side and Shields took the opposite side.</p><p>"all right, then. Turn him toward me, " Shields instructed. "Magistrate, can you help us at alli"</p><p>"I shall try, " Woodward whispered.</p><p>Together, the doctor and Mrs. Nettles repositioned Woodward so he lay on his stomach. Matthew was torn about whether to give a hand, for he feared what Dr. Shields had decided to do. The magistrate gave a single groan during the procedure, but otherwise bore the pain and indignity like a gentleman.</p><p>"Very well." Dr. Shields looked across the bed at Mrs. Nettles. "I shall have to lift his gown up, as his back must be bared."</p><p>"What procedure is thisi" Matthew asked. "I demand to know!"</p><p>"For your information, young man, it is a time-tested procedure to move the blood within the body. It involves heat and a vacuum effect. Mrs. Nettles, would you remove yourself, pleasei For the sake of decorumi"</p><p>"Shall I wait outsidei"</p><p>"No, that won't be necessary. I shall call if you're needed." He paused while Mrs. Nettles left the room, and when the door was again closed he said to Woodward, "I am going to pull your gown up to your shoulders, Isaac. Whatever help you may give me is much appreciated."</p><p>"Yes, " came the muffled reply. "Do what is needed."</p><p>The doctor went about the business of exposing Woodward's buttocks and back. Matthew saw that at the base of the magistrate's spine was a bed sore about two inches in diameter, bright red at its center and outlined with yellow infection. a second, smaller, but no less malignant sore had opened on the back of Woodward's right thigh.</p><p>Dr. Shields opened his bag, brought out a pair of supple deerskin gloves, and began to put them on. "If your stomach is weak, " he said quietly to Matthew, "you should follow Mrs. Nettles. I need no further complications."</p><p>"My stomach is fine, " Matthew lied. "What... is the procedurei"</p><p>The doctor reached into the bag again and brought out a small glass sphere, its surface marred only by a circular opening with a pronounced curved rim. The rim, Matthew saw with sickened fascination, had been discolored dark brown by the application of fire. "as I said before... heat and vacuum." From the pocket of his tan waistcoat he produced the fragrant piece of sassafras root, which he deftly pushed to the magistrate's lips. "Isaac, there will be some pain involved, and we wish your tongue not to be injured." Woodward accepted the tongue-guard and sank his teeth into the accustomed grooves. "Young man, will you hold the candles, pleasei"</p><p>Matthew picked up the double candlestick from the table beside Woodward's bed. Dr. Shields leaned forward and stroked the sphere's rim from one flame to the other in a circular motion, all the time staring into Matthew's eyes in order to gauge his nerves. as he continued to heat the rim, Shields said, "Magistrate, I am going to apply a blister cup to your back. The first of six. I regret the sensation, but the afflicted blood will be caused to rise to the surface from the internal organs and that is our purpose. are you ready, siri"</p><p>Woodward nodded, his eyes squeezed tightly shut. Shields held the cup's opening directly over the flames for perhaps five seconds. Then, rapidly and without hesitation, he pressed the hot glass rim down upon Woodward's white flesh a few inches upward from the virulent bedsore.</p><p>There was a small noise - a snake's hiss, perhaps - and the cup clamped tightly as the heated air within compressed itself. an instant after the hideous contact was made, Woodward cried out around the sassafras root and his body shivered in a spasm of pure, animal pain.</p><p>"Steady, " Shields said, speaking to both the magistrate and his clerk. "Let nature do its work."</p><p>Matthew could see that already the flesh caught within the blister cup was swelling and reddening. Dr. Shields had brought a second cup from his bag, and again let the flames lick its cruel rim. after the procedure of heating the air inside the cup, the glass was pressed to Woodward's back with predictable and - at least to Matthew - spine-crawling result.</p><p>By the time the third cup was affixed, the flesh within the first had gone through the stages of red to scarlet and now was blood-gorged and turning brown like a maliferous poison mushroom.</p><p>Shields had the fourth cup in his gloved hand. He offered it to the candle flames. "We shall see a play directly, I understand, " he said, his voice divorced from his actions. "The citizens do enjoy the maskers every year."</p><p>Matthew didn't answer. He was watching the first brown mushroom of flesh becoming still darker, and the other two following the path of swollen discoloration.</p><p>"Usually, " the doctor went on, "they don't arrive until the middle of July or so. I understand from Mr. Brightman - he's the leader of the company - that two towns they customarily play in were decimated by sickness, and a third had vanished altogether. That accounts for their early arrival this year. It's a thing to be thankful for, though, because we need a pleasant diversion." He pressed the fourth blister cup onto Woodward's back, and the magistrate trembled but held back a moan. "My wife and I used to enjoy the theater in Boston, " Shields said as he prepared the fifth implement. "a play in the afternoon... a beaker of wine... a concert on the Commons." He smiled faintly. "Those were wonderful times."</p><p>Matthew had recovered his composure enough to ask the question that at this point naturally presented itself. "Why did you leave Bostoni"</p><p>The doctor waited until the fifth cup was attached before he replied. "Well... let us say I needed a challenge. Or perhaps... there was something I wished to accomplish."</p><p>"and have youi accomplished it, I meani"</p><p>Shields stared at the rim of the sixth cup as he moved it between the flames, and Matthew saw the fire reflected in his spectacles. "No, " he said. "Not yet."</p><p>"This involves Fount Royal, I presumei and your infirmaryi"</p><p>"It involves... what it involves." Shields glanced quickly into Matthew's eyes and then away again. "You do have a fetish for questions, don't youi"</p><p>If this remark was designed to seal Matthew's mouth and turn aside his curiosity, it had the opposite effect. "Only for questions that go unanswered."</p><p>"Touche, " the doctor said, and he pressed the sixth blister cup firmly onto Woodward's back. again the magistrate trembled with pain but was steadfastly silent. "all right, then: I left Boston because my practise was failing there. The city has a glut of doctors, as well as lawyers and ministers. There must be a dozen physicians alone, not to mention the herbalists and faith-healers! So I decided that for a space of time I would leave Boston - and my wife, whose sewing enterprise is actually doing quite well -&nbsp;&nbsp;and offer my services elsewhere."</p><p>"Fount Royal is a long distance from Boston, " Matthew said.</p><p>"Oh, I didn't come directly here. I lived for a month in New York, spent a summer in Philadelphia, and lived in other smaller places. I always seemed to be heading southward." He began peeling off his deerskin gloves. "You may put the candles down now."</p><p>Matthew returned the double candlestick to the table. He had seen - though he certainly didn't let his eyes linger on the sight, or his imagination linger on what the sensation must be -&nbsp;&nbsp;that the flesh gripped by the first two cups had become hideous, blood-swollen ebony blisters. The others were following the gruesome pattern.</p><p>"We shall let the blood rise for a time." Dr. Shields put the gloves into his bag. "This procedure breaks up the stagnant pools within his body, you see."</p><p>Matthew saw nothing but grotesque swellings. He dared not dwell on what pressures were inflicted within the magistrate's suffering bones. To keep his mind from wandering in that painful direction, he asked, "Do you plan on staying in Fount Royal very much longeri"</p><p>"No, I don't think so. Bidwell pays me a fee, and he has certainly built a fine infirmary for my use, but... I do miss my wife. and Boston, too. So as soon as the town is progressing again, the population healthy and growing, I shall seek to find a replacement for myself."</p><p>"and what then would be the accomplishment you crave, siri"</p><p>Dr. Shields cocked his head to one side, a hint of a smile on his mouth but his owlish eyes stony. "You're a regular goat amid a briar patch, aren't youi"</p><p>"I pride myself on being persistent, if that's your meaning."</p><p>"No, that is not my meaning, but I'll answer that rather meddlesome question in spite of my reluctance to add pine knots to your fire. My accomplishment - my hoped-for accomplishment, that is - would be twofold: one, to aid in the construction of a settlement that would grow into a city; and two, to have my name forevermore on the title of Fount Royal's infirmary. I plan on remaining here long enough to see both those things come to pass." He reached out and gently grasped the first blister cup between thumb and forefinger, checking its suction. "The influence of Rachel Howarth, " he said, "was an unfortunate interruption in the forward motion of Fount Royal. But as soon as her ashes are buried - or scattered or whatever Bidwell's going to do with them - we shall put an end to our calamities. as the weather has turned for the better, the swamp vapors have been banished. Soon we shall see an increase in the population, both by people coming in from elsewhere and by healthy babies being born. Within a year, I think Fount Royal will be back to where it was before this ugly incident ever happened. I shall do my best to aid that growth, leave my mark and name for posterity, and return to Boston and my wife. and, of course, the comfort and culture of the city."</p><p>"admirable aims, " Matthew said. "I expect having your name on the mast of an infirmary would help your standing in Boston, as well."</p><p>"It would. a letter from Bidwell stating that fact and his appreciation for my services could secure me a place in a medical partnership that ordinarily I might be denied."</p><p>Matthew was about to ask if Bidwell knew what the doctor intended when there was a knock at the door. Shields said, "Who is it, pleasei"</p><p>"Nicholas, " came the reply. "I wanted to look in on the magistrate."</p><p>Instantly Matthew sensed a change in Dr. Shields's demeanor. It was nothing radical, but remarkable nevertheless. The doctor's face seemed to tighten; indeed, his entire body went taut as if an unseen hand had gripped him around the back of his neck. When Shields answered, even his voice had sharpened. "The magistrate is indisposed at the moment."</p><p>"Oh... well, then. I'll return later."</p><p>"Wait!" Woodward had removed the sassafras root from his mouth, and was whispering in Matthew's direction. "ask Mr. Paine to come in, please."</p><p>Matthew went to the door and stopped Paine before he reached the stairs. When Paine entered the room, Matthew watched the doctor's face and saw that Shields refused to even cast a glance at his fellow citizen.</p><p>"How is hei" Paine inquired, standing at the door.</p><p>"as I said, indisposed, " Shields replied, with a distinct chill. "You can see for yourself."</p><p>Paine flinched a little at the sight of the six glass cups and the ebony blisters they had drawn, but he came around to Matthew's side of the bed for a view of the magistrate's face. "Good evening, " he said, with as much of a smile as he could summon. "I see... Dr. Shields is taking care of you. How are you feelingi"</p><p>"I have felt... much superior, " Woodward said.</p><p>"I'm sure." Paine's smile faltered. "I wanted to tell you... that I approve heartily of your decree, sir. also that your efforts - and the efforts of your clerk, of course - have been nothing short of commendable."</p><p>"My thanks, " Woodward replied, his eyes heavy-lidded.</p><p>"Might I get you anythingi"</p><p>"You might leave, " Shields said. "You're taxing him."</p><p>"Oh. I'm sorry. I don't wish to do any harm."</p><p>"No harm." Woodward gasped for a breath, a green crust around his nostrils. "I appreciate... your taking... time and effort... to come and see me."</p><p>"I also wanted to tell you, sir, that the stake has been cut. I understand Mr. Bidwell hasn't yet decided where the execution shall take place, but the likelihood is in one of the unused fields on Industry Street."</p><p>"Yes." Woodward swallowed thickly. "That would do."</p><p>Shields grasped the first blister cup and popped it free. Woodward winced and bit his lower lip. "I think you should depart now, " the doctor said to Paine. "Unless you'd like to give a hand in this procedurei"</p><p>"Uh... yes, I'd best be going." Paine, for all his manly experiences, appeared to Matthew to be a little green around the gills. "Magistrate, I'll look in on you at a later time." He glanced at Matthew with a pained expression of commiseration and took a step toward the door.</p><p>"Mr. Painei" Woodward whispered. "Please... may I ask you somethingi"</p><p>"Yes, surely." Paine returned to the bedside and stood close, leaning toward the magistrate, the better to hear him clearly.</p><p>Shields removed the second blister cup. again Woodward winced, and now his eyes were wet. He said, "We share... a commonality."</p><p>"We do, siri"</p><p>"Your wife. Died of fits, I understand. I wanted you to know... my son... perished of fits... suffered by the plague. Was your wife... also plague-strickeni"</p><p>Dr. Shields's hand had seized the third blister cup, but had not yet removed it.</p><p>Nicholas Paine stared into Woodward's face. Matthew saw a pulse beating at Paine's temple. "I fear you're mistaken, sir, " Paine said, in a strangely hollow voice. "I have never been married."</p><p>"Dr. Shields told me, " Woodward went on, with an effort. "I know... such things are difficult to speak of. Believe me, I do know."</p><p>"Dr. Shields, " Paine repeated, "told you."</p><p>"Yes. That she suffered fits until she died. and that... possibly it was the plague."</p><p>Shields removed the third cup and placed it almost noiselessly into his bag.</p><p>Paine licked his lower lip. "I'm sorry, " he said, "but I fear Dr. Shields is just as mistaken as - " He chose that instant to look into the doctor's face, and Matthew was a witness to what next occurred.</p><p>Something passed between Paine and Shields. It was something intangible, yet absolutely horrific. For the briefest of seconds Matthew saw the doctor's eyes blaze with a hatred that defied all reason and logic, and Paine actually drew back as if from a threatening physical presence. Matthew also realized that he'd witnessed very little direct communication between Dr. Shields and Paine. It dawned on Matthew that it was the doctor who preferred to keep his distance from Paine, yet the feeling had been so well disguised that Paine might not even have been aware of a void between them.</p><p>However, now an ugly animosity was clearly revealed if only for that fleeting second. Paine perhaps recognized it for the first time, and his mouth opened as if he might exclaim or protest against it. Yet in the next heartbeat Paine's face froze as tightly as the doctor's and whatever he might have said remained unborn.</p><p>Shields held the dark bond between them for only a second or two longer, and then he very calmly returned his attention to his patient. He removed the fourth blister cup, and into the bag it went.</p><p>Matthew looked questioningly at Paine, but the other man had blanched and would not meet his gaze. Matthew realized a piece of information had been delivered from Dr. Shields to Paine in that brief hateful glare, and whatever it was had almost buckled Paine's knees.</p><p>"My wife, " Paine's voice was choked with emotion. "My wife."</p><p>"My son... died, " Woodward said, oblivious to the drama. "Fits. From the plague. Pardon my asking you... but I wished you to know... you were not alone in your grief."</p><p>"Grief, " Paine repeated. Shadows lay in his eye sockets, and his face appeared to have become more gaunt and aged by five years in as many seconds. "Yes, " he said quietly. "Grief."</p>       <amp-ad

          </amp-ad><p>Dr. Shields pulled the fifth blister cup free, none too gently, and Woodward winced.</p><p>"I should... tell you about my wife, " Paine offered, his face turned toward the window. "She did perish from fits. But not caused by the plague. No." He shook his head. "Hunger was the killer. Hunger... and crushing despair. We were very young, you see. Very poor. We had a baby girl who was sick, as well. and I was sick in the mind... and very desperate."</p><p>No one spoke. Even the magistrate, in his cloudy realm on the edge of delirium, realized Paine had dropped his mask of sturdy self-control and was revealing heart's blood and fractured bones.</p><p>"I think I understand this, " Paine said, though that strange remark itself was a puzzle to Matthew. "I am... quite overcome... but I must tell you... all of you... that I never intended... the result of what happened. as I said, I was young... I was brash, and I was frightened. My wife and my child needed food and medicine. I had nothing... but an ability I had learned from hunting cruel and violent men." He was silent for a time, during which Dr. Shields stared intently at the sixth blister cup but made no attempt at removing it.</p><p>"I did not fire the first shot, " Paine went on, his voice tired and heavy. "I was first struck myself. In the leg. But you must know that already. Something I had been taught by the older men... during my career at sea... was that once a weapon -&nbsp;&nbsp;pistol or rapier - was aimed at you, you fired or slashed back with grievous intent. That was our creed, and it served to keep us -&nbsp;&nbsp;most of us - among the living. It was a natural reaction, learned by watching other men die wallowing in their own blood. That was why I could not - could not - spare Quentin Summers in our duel. How can a man be taught the ways of a wolf and then live among sheepi Especially... when there is hunger and need involved... and the specter of death knocking at the door."</p><p>Matthew's curiosity had ignited from a flame to a bonfire and he yearned to ask Paine exactly what he was talking about, but something of the moment seemed almost sacred in its self-revelation, in its picture of a proud man giving up his pride to the overwhelming desire for confession and - perhaps - sanctuary from past misdeeds. Therefore he felt it small of himself to speak and break this spell of soul-broaching.</p><p>Paine walked to the window and looked out over the lantern-spangled town. On Industry Street, two fires some distance apart marked the camps of Exodus Jerusalem and the newly arrived maskers. Through the warm night wafted the faint sound of laughter and the trilling of a recorder from Van Gundy's tavern. "My compliments, " Paine said, his face still averted. "I presume my wound left a trail. Is that what you followedi"</p><p>Dr. Shields at last freed the ebony flesh under the sixth blister cup. He put the implement into his bag, followed by the sassafras root. Then, slowly and methodically, he began to close the bag by its buttons and loops.</p><p>"are you not going to answer mei" Paine asked. "Or is this a torture by silencei"</p><p>"I think, " the doctor said with grit in his voice, "that the time has come for you to depart."</p><p>"Departi What game are you playing ati"</p><p>"No game. I assure you... no game." Shields pressed a finger to one of the six horrid black swellings that protruded from Woodward's back. "ah, yes. Quite firm now. We have drawn the stagnant blood upward from the organs, you seei" He glanced at Matthew, then away. "This procedure has a cleansing effect, and we should see some improvement in the magistrate's condition by morning."</p><p>"and if noti" Matthew had to ask.</p><p>"If not... then there is the next step."</p><p>"Which isi"</p><p>"again applying the cups, " Shields said, "and then bleeding the blisters." Matthew instantly regretted his inquiry. The thought of those swellings being burst by a lancet was almost too much to consider.</p><p>Shields lowered the magistrate's gown. "You should endeavor to sleep on your stomach tonight, Isaac. I know your position is less than comfortable, but I'm afraid it's necessary."</p><p>"I shall endure it, " Woodward rasped, drifting even now toward sleep again.</p><p>"Good. I'll have Mrs. Nettles send a servant with a cold compress for your fever. In the morning we shall - "</p><p>"Shields, what do you want of mei" Paine interrupted, this time daring to face the other man. Moisture glistened on Paine's forehead and cheeks.</p><p>The doctor lifted his eyebrows. "I've already told you, sir. I wish you to depart."</p><p>"are you going to hold this over my head for the rest of my lifei"</p><p>Shields did not answer, but stared fixedly through his spectacle lenses at his antagonist. So damning was this wordless accusation that Paine was forced at length to drop his gaze to the floorboards. Then, abruptly, Paine turned toward the door and slinked out in the manner of the wolf he had proclaimed himself to be - yet, however, a wolf whose tail had been shorn off by an unexpected blade.</p><p>In the wake of Paine's departure, Dr. Shields let free a breath he'd been hoarding. "Well, " he said, and behind the lenses his magnified eyes appeared stunned by the rapid turn of events. He blinked slowly several times, as if clearing his mind as well as his vision. "What was I sayingi Oh... in the morning we shall administer a colonic and apply fresh plasters. Then we shall proceed as necessary." He took a handkerchief from inside his jacket and mopped his brow. "Is it hot in here to youi"</p><p>"No, sir, " Matthew said. "The temperature seems very regular." He now saw his opportunity. "May I ask what your exchange with Mr. Paine concernedi"</p><p>"I will have Mrs. Nettles look in on the magistrate from time to time tonight, " the doctor said. "You might keep yourself aware, also. I will be ready to come if any emergency presents itself." He placed a reassuring hand on Woodward's shoulder. "I'm going to leave now, Isaac, just rest and be of good spirits. Tomorrow we might have you up and walking for some exercise." From the magistrate there was no reply, because he had already fallen asleep.</p><p>"Good night, " Shields said to Matthew and, taking his bag with him, he left the bedchamber.</p><p>Matthew was after him like a shot. "One moment, sir!" he called in the hallway, but to be such a small-framed man Dr. Shields suddenly had the stride of a racehorse. Just before the doctor reached the stairs, Matthew said, "If you refuse to tell me, I shall find out on my own."</p><p>This statement caused an immediate reaction. Dr. Shields halted in his tracks, spun around with furious speed, and advanced on Matthew as if to strike the clerk a blow. By the Mars-orange glow of the hallway's lantern, Shields's face was a hellish, sweating rictus with bared and clenched teeth, his eyes drawn into narrow slits that made him appear a stranger to the man Matthew had seen only seconds before. To compound this transformation, Shields gripped the front of Matthew's shirt with one hand and forced his back solidly and painfully into the wall.</p><p>"You listen!" Shields hissed. His hand tightened, twisting the fabric it clenched. "You do not - I repeat, do not- - have the right to interfere in my business. What transpired between Paine and myself tonight will remain just that: between him and me. No one else. Certainly not you. Do you understand me, boyi" Shields gave Matthew a violent shake to underscore his vehemence. 'answer!"</p><p>In spite of the fact that he towered over the doctor, Matthew was stricken with fright. "Yes, sir, " Matthew said. "I do understand."</p><p>"You'd better, or by God you'll wish you had!" Shields held Matthew pressed up against the wall for a few seconds longer -&nbsp;&nbsp;an eternity to Matthew - and then the doctor's hand left his shirt. Without a further word, Shields walked away and descended the stairs.</p><p>Matthew was left severely confused and no less severely scared. The doctor might have been a brother to Will Shawcombe, for all that rough treatment. as he straightened his shirt and tried to steady his nerves, Matthew realized something truly treacherous was going on between Shields and Paine; indeed, the violence induced from Shields spoke volumes about the doctor's mental state. What had all that been, about wounds and weapons and Paine's deceased wifei I presume my wound left a trail, Paine had said. Is that what you followedi</p><p>Whatever the problem was, it had to do with Paine's past -&nbsp;&nbsp;which seemed more infamous now than ever. But Matthew was faced with so many puzzles to untangle concerning Rachel's plight - and such a short time to untangle them - that this new situation seemed more of a sideshow than a compelling attraction. He didn't believe the strife between the two men had anything to do with Rachel, whereas, for instance, Gwinett Linch's voice singing in the darkness of the Hamilton house while Satan laid an ultimatum at the feet of Violet adams most certainly did.</p><p>Therefore, though he might fervently desire to know more about the relationship he'd witnessed tonight, he felt pressed by time to keep his focus on proving Rachel's innocence and let old griefs fall by the wayside. For now, at least.</p><p>He looked in once more on the magistrate and waited for the servant girl to come with the cold compress. Matthew thanked her, bade her go, and himself applied the compress - a water-soaked cotton cloth, to be accurate - to the sleeping man's face and on the back of his neck where the fever seemed most heated. afterward, Matthew went downstairs and found Mrs. Nettles closing the shutters for the night. He asked if he might have a pot of tea and some biscuits, and was soon thereafter in possession of a tray with both. He took the moment to inquire of Mrs. Nettles what she knew about the ratcatcher, but she could supply nothing other than the facts that Linch kept to himself, and though he was sorely needed he was something of a pariah because of the nature of his craft. Matthew also asked - in a most casual way - if Mrs. Nettles had ever detected a tension between Dr. Shields and Nicholas Paine, or knew of anything that might be a cause of trouble in their dealings with each other.</p><p>Mrs. Nettles answered that she knew of no trouble, but that she was aware of a certain chill emanating from the good doctor regarding Mr. Paine. By contrast, she said, Dr. Shields acted warmly toward Mr. Winston and Mr. Bidwell, but it was apparent to her that the doctor would rather not share the same room in which Mr. Paine was present. It was nothing so dramatic that anyone else might notice, but in her opinion Dr. Shields had a marked distaste for the man.</p><p>"Thank you, " Matthew said. "Oh... one more thing. Who arrived first in Fount Royali Mr. Paine or the doctori"</p><p>"Mr. Paine did, " she replied. "It was... oh, more'n a month or two a'fore Dr. Shields came." She knew there must be a valid reason for these questions. "Does this concern Rachel Howarthi"</p><p>"No, I don't believe so. It's only an observation I needed verified."</p><p>"Oh, I swan it's more'n that!" She offered him a sly smile. "You canna' leave a thread undone, can yai"</p><p>"I might find employment as a weaver of rugs, if that's what you mean."</p><p>"Ha!" She gave a rough bark of a laugh. "Yes, I 'spect you might!" However, her smile vanished and her countenance darkened until she had reached her customary grim composure. "It's all up for Madam Howarth then, is that the basketi"</p><p>"The lid has not yet been closed, " Matthew said.</p><p>"Meanin' whati"</p><p>"Meaning that the execution flame has not yet been lighted... and that I have some reading to do. Excuse me and good night." Matthew took his tray of tea and biscuits upstairs to his room, where he poured himself a cup and sat down next to the open window, his lantern burning on its sill. For the third time he took the documents from their protective box and began reading through them, starting at the beginning.</p><p>By now he might have recited the testimony by heart. Still he felt - or, rather, ardently hoped - that something in the thicket of words might leap out at him like a directional signpost, signaling the next step in his exploration. He drank from his cup of tea and chewed on a biscuit. Bidwell had taken his own repast at Van Gundy's tavern, as Matthew had discovered from Dr. Shields, who had earlier seen Bidwell hoisting a tankard with Winston and several other men in a general air of merry celebration.</p><p>He finished - for the third time - Jeremiah Buckner's account and paused to rub his eyes. He felt in need of a tankard himself, yet strong drink would weaken his resolve and blur his sight. Oh, for a night of pure sleep untouched by the thought of Rachel afire on the stake!</p><p>Or even a night untouched by the thought of Rachel. Period.</p><p>He recalled what the magistrate had said: Helping her. Finding the truth. Being of service. Whatever and however you choose to phrase it... Rachel Howarth is your nightbird, Matthew. Perhaps the magistrate was right, but not in the sinister way he had meant it.</p><p>Matthew closed his eyes for a moment to rest them. Then he opened them, drank some more tea to fortify himself, and continued his reading. Now he was venturing into the testimony of Elias Garrick, and the man's recollection of the night he had awakened and -&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, he thought. That was odd.</p><p>He read again over the section he had just digested. That night I was feelin' poorly, and I waked up to go outside and spew what was makin' me ill. It was silent. Every thin' was silent, like the whole world was afeared to breathe.</p><p>Matthew sat up from his slouched position in the chair. He reached out and pulled the lantern nearer. Then he turned back through the pages until he found the beginning of Jeremiah Buckner's testimony.</p><p>and there it was.</p><p>Me and Patience went to bed just like usual that night. She put out the lamp. Then... I don't know how long it was later... 1 heard my name spoke. I opened my eyes. Every thin' was dark, and silent. I waited, a'listenin'. Just silent, like there was nothin' else in the whole world makin' a sound but my breathin'. Then... I heard my name spoke again, and I looked at the foot of the bed and seen her.</p><p>With an eager hand, Matthew turned to the beginning of Violet adams's testimony, as she recounted entering the Hamilton house. He put a finger on the line of importance, his heart starting to slam hard in his chest.</p><p>There wasn't nary a noise. It was silent, like... it was just me breathin' and that was the only sound.</p><p>Three witnesses.</p><p>Three testimonies.</p><p>But the same word: silent.</p><p>and that about breathing being the only sound... what possible coincidence could that bei also the repeated phrase whole world by both Buckner and Garrick... it defied reason to think both men would speak the exact same words.</p><p>Unless... without knowing it... all three of the witnesses had been told what to say.</p><p>Matthew felt a chill skitter up his spine. The hairs on the back of his neck moved. He realized he had just had a glimpse of the shadow he sought.</p><p>It was a terrifying realization. Because the shadow was larger and darker and more strangely powerful than he had dared believe. The shadow had been standing behind Jeremiah Buckner,</p><p>Elias Garrick, and Violet adams there in the gaol, all the time they'd been giving their accounts.</p><p>"My God, " Matthew whispered, his eyes wide. Because he had realized the shadow was in their minds, directing their words, emotions, and counterfeit memories. The three witnesses were no more than flesh-and-blood poppets, constructed by the hand of an evil beyond Matthew's imagining.</p><p>One hand. The same hand. a hand that sewed six gold buttons on a Satanic cloak. That created a white-haired imp, a leathery lizard-like manbeast, and a bizarre creature that had a male penis and female breasts. The same hand had created these scenes of sickening depravity, had painted them on the very air to display to Buckner, Garrick, Violet, and probably other citizens, who had fled for their sanity. For that's what the scenes were: air-paintings. Or, rather, paintings that came to life inside the minds that were spelled to accept them as truth.</p><p>That was why Buckner could not recall where he'd put his cane, which he was unable to get around without, or whether he had worn a coat outside in the cold February air, or whether he had taken his shoes off when he'd climbed back into bed.</p><p>That was why Garrick could not recall what clothes he had worn outside to go spew, or whether he had put on shoes or boots, or what pattern the six gold buttons were arranged in though he clearly noted their number.</p><p>That was why Violet adams had not noticed the reek of a decaying dog's carcass, or the fact that the Hamilton house was overrun by canines.</p><p>Not one of the three witnesses had actually witnessed anything but these mental paintings, constructed by a shadowy hand that had emphasized some details for the purpose of shock and disgust - the kind of details that would make for damning court testimony - but had omitted other details of a more commonplace nature.</p><p>Except for the pattern of gold buttons on the cloak, Matthew thought. That was where the shadowy hand had been... the only word Matthew could think of was precious.</p><p>The hand had made the oversight of not detailing the arrangement of buttons for Buckner or Garrick, but had attempted to make up for it by providing that detail to Violet, who collected buttons and therefore might be more observant as to their pattern.</p><p>It occurred to Matthew that the shadowy hand might have placed the poppets under the floor of Rachel's house, and then painted the dream by which Cara Grunewald had seen an item of importance hidden there. He would have liked to have spoken to Madam Grunewald, to learn if, when she'd gone to sleep that night, everything was silent, as if the whole world was feared to breathe.</p><p>Matthew turned through the pages to another point he recalled of Garrick's account. It was when he had challenged Garrick concerning the arrangement of the six gold buttons, and had pressed his question to the man's obviously confused agitation.</p><p>Garrick's response had been a whispered It was a silent town. Silent. The whole world, afeared to breathe.</p><p>Matthew realized that what he had heard was Garrick repeating a phrase supplied to him by the owner of the shadowy hand. Garrick had been unable to answer the question, and had unwittingly fixed on that somnambulistic phrase in a moment of great stress because it was one of the clearest things he did remember.</p><p>and now there was the question of Linch's voice, singing in the dark at the Hamilton house. If Violet had not actually set foot in the house, how could she have heard the ratcatcher singing his grotesque ditty from the back roomi</p><p>Matthew put aside the documents and finished his cup of tea, staring out the window toward the slaves' quarters and the darkness beyond. He might have decided that Violet had been dreaming the involvement of Linch as well as the rest of it, but his own exploration of Linch's dwelling told Matthew the ratcatcher had concealed the secrets of his identity behind a cleverly constructed front.</p><p>Linch was literate and obviously cunning. Was it possible his was the shadowy hand that had guided the three witnessesi</p><p>But whyi and howi By what form of sorcery had Linch - or whomever - caused three individuals to see similar apparitions and believe without a doubt they had been viewing realityi It had to be black magic, of a sort. Not the kind popularly associated with Satan, but the kind that evolves from a corrupt and twisted human mentality. But also a mentality that was well ordered and precise, as Linch's must be.</p><p>Matthew couldn't understand how Linch, or anyone else, might have done it.</p><p>Such a thing - the guiding of three minds toward a common fiction - seemed to be absolutely impossible. Nevertheless, Matthew was certain that was exactly what had occurred.</p><p>and what of the question of motivei Why go to such lengths - and such incredible risk - to paint Rachel as being a servant of the Devili It had to be much more than simply covering the tracks that led away from the murders of Reverend Grove and Daniel Howarth. In fact, those killings seemed to Matthew to have been committed to add weight of suspicion upon Rachel.</p><p>So the point was to create a witch, Matthew thought. Rachel was already disliked by many of the citizens before Grove was murdered. Her dark beauty could not have aided her popularity among the other women, and her Portuguese heritage reminded the men of how close the Spanish territory lay to their farmland. She had a tongue, a willful spirit, and courage that ruffled the feathers of the church-guarding hens. Therefore Rachel was from the beginning a perfect candidate.</p><p>Matthew chewed on another biscuit. He looked at the stars that glittered above the ocean, and at the candle that burned within the lantern's glass. The light of understanding was what he sought, yet it was a difficult illumination to unveil.</p><p>Why create a witchi What possible reason was there for iti To hurt Bidwelli Was all this engineered by the jealous ravens of Charles Town to destroy Fount Royal before it could grow to rivalryi</p><p>If that were so, wouldn't Winston have known Rachel was innocenti Or had the Charles Town elders planted another traitor or two within Fount Royal's midst and for the sake of security not informed Winstoni</p><p>and then there was the question of the mysterious surveyor, and what might lie in the mud at the fount's bottom. It struck him that tomorrow night - very late, after the last lantern had gone out and the final celebrants swept from Van Gundy's tavern - he might try his strength at some underwater swimming.</p><p>Though the tea was certainly sturdy enough, Matthew still felt weariness pulling at him. It was his mind that needed rest just as much - if not more so - than his body. He needed to climb into bed, sleep until dawn, and awaken ready for a fresh appraisal of what he suspected, what he knew, and what he had yet to learn.</p><p>Matthew relieved himself at the chamberpot, then undressed and lay down upon the bed. He left the lantern burning, as his realization of the shadowy hand's strange and compelling power had made him somewhat less than easy with the dark.</p><p>He tossed and turned in the first bout of what would be a nightlong grappling with the hot gearwheels of his brain. at last, though, he relaxed enough to sleep for a time, and except for the occasional barking of a mongrel the town was ruled by silence.</p> </div> </div> <div class="row turn-page"> <a class="col-xs-2" href="/Speaks%20the%20Nightbird%20(Matthew%20Corbett%20%231)/28.html?v=1662298104776">Previous</a> <a class="col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:center;" href="/Speaks%20the%20Nightbird%20(Matthew%20Corbett%20%231)/book.html?v=1662298104775">Table</a> <a class="col-xs-2 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:right;" href="/Speaks%20the%20Nightbird%20(Matthew%20Corbett%20%231)/30.html?v=1662298104778"> Next</a> </div> <hr></div><hr><footer class="container"> <p>© Company 2014</p></footer><amp-lightbox id="searchLightbox" class="-il" layout="nodisplay" on="lightboxOpen:searchInput.focus; lightboxClose:searchTriggerOpen.focus" scrollable="" hidden="hidden"> <div> <div class="-ic" role="button" tabindex="0" on="tap:searchLightbox.close"></div> <div class="-ih"> <div class="-sg -sb" on="tap: searchLightbox.close, AMP.setState({ query: '' }), searchForm.clear" role="button" tabindex="0"> <div class="ap-a-ico -sw"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#close"></use> </svg> </div> </div> <div class="ap-o-search-field"> <form action="#" action-xhr="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/echo" class="-ip" id="searchForm" on="submit:AMP.setState({ query: throttledValue }),searchResult.focus" target="_top"> <amp-autocomplete class="-id" filter="substring" min-characters="1" on="select:AMP.setState({ query: event.value })" submit-on-enter="false" src="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/autosuggest"> <div class="ap-a-ico -im"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#search"></use> </svg> </div> <input id="searchInput" class="-iv" name="q" placeholder="What are you looking for?" on="input-throttled:AMP.setState({ throttledValue: event.value })" required=""> <button class="-ig" type="submit" name="search-submit" disabled="" [disabled]="!throttledValue">Search </button> <div role="listbox"></div> </amp-autocomplete> </form> <div class="empty" [class]="query ?
