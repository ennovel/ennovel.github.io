In seconds he seemed an inch or two taller. His shoulders appeared to widen against the fabric of his dark blue jacket, as if the man had been tightly compressing himself around his secret core.</p><p>When he turned toward Matthew again, it was with an unhurried grace. Johnstone was smiling, but the truth had delivered its blow; his face was damp, his eyes deep-sunken and shock-blasted.</p><p>"Sirs, " he said, "dear sirs. I must confess... I never attended Oxford. Oh, this is embarrassing. Quite so. I attended a small school in Wales. I was... the son of a miner, and I realized at an early age... that some doors would be closed to my ascent, if I did not attempt to hide some... um... unfortunate and unsavory elements of my family. Therefore, I created - "</p><p>"a lie, just as you're creating now, " Matthew interrupted. "are you incapable of telling the truthi"</p><p>Johnstone's mouth, which was open to speak the next falsehood, slowly closed. His smile had vanished, his face as grim as gray stone.</p><p>"I think he's lived with lies so long they're like a suit, without which he would feel nude to the world, " Matthew said. "You did learn a great deal about Oxford, though, didn't youi Did you actually go there and tour the place when you returned to England, just in case you needed the informationi It never hurts to add details to your script, does iti and all that about your social club!" Matthew shook his head and clucked his tongue. "are the Ruskins even really in existence, or is that your own true namei You know, I might have realized I had proof of your lies that very night. When the magistrate recited the motto of his own social club to you, he spoke it in Latin, believing that as a fellow Oxford brother you would need no translation. But when you recited back the motto of the Ruskins, you spoke English. Have you ever known the motto of a social fraternity to be in Englishi Tell me, did you make that motto up on the spoti"</p><p>Johnstone began to laugh. The laughter, however, was strained through his tightly clenched teeth, and therefore was less merry than murderous.</p><p>"This woman who was purported to be your wife, " Matthew said. "Who was shei Some insane wretch from Charles Towni No, no, you would have had to find someone you at least imagined you could control. Was she then a doxy, to whom you could promise future wealth for her cooperationi"</p><p>The laughter faded and went away, but Johnstone continued to grin. His face, the flesh drawn over the bones and the eyeholes dwindled to burns, had taken on the appearance of a truly demonic mask.</p><p>"I presume you made quick work of the woman, as soon as you'd left sight of Charles Town, " Matthew ventured. "Did she believe you were returning her to the dove roosti"</p><p>Johnstone suddenly turned and began to limp toward the door, proving that his kneebrace enforced the fiction of his deformity.</p><p>"Mr. Greeni" Matthew called, in a casual tone. The doorway was presently blocked by the red-bearded giant, who also held at his side a pistol. "That weapon has been prepared for firing, sir, " Matthew said. "I don't for an instant doubt your ability to inflict deadly violence, therefore the necessary precaution against it. Would you please come back to your chairi"</p><p>Johnstone didn't respond. Green said, "I 'spect you'd best do as Mr. Corbett asks." The air had whistled through the space a front tooth used to occupy.</p><p>"Very well, then!" Johnstone turned toward his tormentor with a theatrical flourish, the death's-head grin at full force. "I shall be glad to sit down and listen to these mad ravings, as I find myself currently imprisoned! You know, you're all bewitched! Every one of you!" He stalked back to the chairs, taking a position not unlike center stage. "God help our minds, to withstand such demonic power! Don't you see iti" He pointed at Matthew, who was gratified to see that the hand trembled. "This boy is in league with the blackest evil to ever crawl from a pit! God help us, in its presence!" Now Johnstone held his hand palm-upward, in a gesture of supplication. "I throw myself before your common sense, sirs! Before your decency and love of fellow man! God knows these are the first things any demon would try to destr - "</p><p>Smack! went a book down onto Johnstone's offered palm. Johnstone staggered, and stared at the volume of English plays that Matthew had devoured, and that Mrs. Nettles had returned to the nearby bookcase.</p><p>"Poor Tom Foolery, I believe, " Matthew said. "I think on page one-seventeen or thereabouts is a similar speech, in case you wish to be more exact."</p><p>Something moved across Johnstone's face in that instant, as he met Matthew's gaze. Something vulpine, and mean as sin. It was as if for a fleeting space of time the animal had been dragged from its den and made to show itself; then the instant passed, and the glimpse was gone. Johnstone's countenance had formed again into stone. Disdainfully, he turned his hand over and let the book fall to the floor.</p><p>"Sit down, " Matthew said firmly, as Mr. Green guarded the doorway. Slowly, with as much dignity as he could cloak himself, Johnstone returned to his chair.</p><p>Matthew went to the fanciful map of Fount Royal that hung on the wall behind him. He tapped the spring with his forefinger. "This, gentleman, is the reason for such deception. at some time in the past - several years, I believe, before Mr. Bidwell sent a land scout to find him suitable property - this spring was used as a vault for pirate treasure. I don't mean just Spanish gold and silver coins, either. I mean jewels, silverware, plates... whatever this pirate and his crew managed to take. as the spring was likely used by this individual as a source of fresh water, he decided to employ it for a different purpose. Mr. Johnstone, do you know this individual's namei" No response. "Well, I'm assuming he was English, since he seemed to prefer attacking Spanish merchant ships. Probably he attacked a few Spanish pirates who were themselves laden with treasure. In any case, he built up a wondrous fortune... but of course, he was always in fear of being attacked himself, therefore he needed a secure hiding-place for his loot. Please correct me, Mr. Johnstone, if I am mistaken at any of these conjectures."</p><p>Johnstone might have burned the very air between them with his stare.</p><p>"Oh, I should tell you, sir, " Matthew said, "that the vast majority of the fortune you schemed to possess is now lost. In my investigation of the pond, I found an opening to an underground flow. a small opening but, regretfully for you, an efficient one as to the movement of water. Over a period of time, most of the loot went down the hole. I don't doubt that there are a few items of value remaining - some coins or pieces of pottery - but the vault has been emptied by the one who truly owns it: Mother Nature."</p><p>He saw now a flinch of true pain on Johnstone's face, as this nerve was so deeply struck. "I suspect you found some items when you posed as the surveyor, and those financed your schoolmaster's suits. a wagon and horses, tooi and clothes for your cardboard wifei Then I presume you also had items to finance your passage back to and from England, and to be able to show Lancaster what was awaiting him. Did you also show him the blade that was awaiting his throati"</p><p>"My God!" Dr. Shields said, aghast. "I... always thought alan came from a wealthy family! I saw a gold ring he owned... with a ruby in it! and a gold pocket watch he had, inscribed with his initials!"</p><p>"Reallyi I'd say the ring was something he'd found. Perhaps he purchased the pocket watch in Charles Town before he came here, and had those initials inscribed to further advance his false identity." Matthew's eyebrows lifted. "Or was it a watch you had previously murdered someone to get, and those initials prompted your choice of a namei"</p><p>"You, " Johnstone said, his mouth twisting, "are absolutely a fool."</p><p>"I have been called so, sir, but never let it be said that I am fooled. at least not for very long. But you are a smart man, sir. I swear you are. If I were to ask Mr. Green to sit in your lap, and take Mr. Bidwell and Mr. Winston for a thorough search of your house, would we find a sapphire brooch therei a book on ancient Egypti Would we find the ratcatcher's five-bladed devicei You know, that was a crowning move! The claw marks! a deception only a talented thespian could construct! and to create a ratcatcher out of John Lancaster... well, it was an inspiration. Did you know that he had experience with training ratsi Had you seen his circus acti You knew Fount Royal was in need of a ratcatcher... therefore, instant acceptance by the town. Was it you or Lancaster who created the poppetsi Those, too, were very convincing. Just rough-edged enough to appeal real."</p><p>"I shall... lose my mind, listening to you, " Johnstone said. He blinked slowly. "Lose my mind... altogether."</p><p>"You decided Rachel was perfect witch material. You knew, as everyone knows, what occurred at Salem. But you, with your sterling abilities to manipulate an audience, realized how such mass fear might be scripted, act upon act. The only problem is that you, sir, are a man who has the command of a crowd's mind, yet you needed a man with the command of the individual mind. The point being to seed this terror in Fount Royal by using selected persons, and thus to ruin the town and cause it to be abandoned. after which you - and Lancaster, or so he believed - might remove the riches."</p><p>Johnstone lifted a hand and touched his forehead. He rocked slightly back and forth in his chair.</p><p>"as to the murder of Daniel Howarth, " Matthew said, "I suspect you lured him out of the house that night to a prearranged meetingi Something he would not have mentioned to Racheli She told me that the night of his murder he asked her if she loved him. She said it was rare for him to be so... well... needful. He already had fears that Nicholas Paine was interested in Rachel. Did you fan those flames, by intimating that Rachel might also have feelings for Painei Did you promise to meet him in a private place, to exchange information that should not be overheardi Of course he wouldn't have known what you were planning. I'm sure your power of persuasion might have directed Daniel to any place you chose, at any time. Who cut his throat, theni You or Lancasteri"</p><p>When Johnstone didn't answer, Matthew said, "You, I think. I presume you then applied the five-bladed device to Daniel's dead or dying bodyi I'm sure Lancaster never would have imagined he'd meet his end the same way. He panicked when he learned he'd been discovered, didn't hei Did he want to leavei" Matthew smiled grimly. "But no, you couldn't have that, could youi You couldn't let him leave, knowing what he knew. Had you always planned to murder him, after he'd helped you remove the treasure and Fount Royal was your own private fortressi"</p><p>"Damn you, " Bidwell said to Johnstone, his face reddening. "Damn your eyes, and heart, and soul. Damn you to a slow death, as you would have made me a murderer too!"</p><p>"Calm yourself, " Matthew advised. "He shall be damned, as I understand the colonial prison is one step above a hellhole and dungheap. Which is where he shall spend some days before he hangs, if I have anything to do with it."</p><p>"That, " Johnstone said wanly, "may be true." Matthew sensed the man was now willing to speak. "But, " Johnstone continued, "I have survived Newgate itself, and so I doubt I shall be much inconvenienced."</p><p>"ahhhhh!" Matthew nodded. He leaned against the wall opposite the man. "a graduate not of Oxford, but of Newgate prison! How did your attendance in such a school come abouti"</p><p>"Debts. Political associations. and friends, " he said, staring at the floor, "with knives. My career was ruined. and I did have a good career. Oh... not that I was ever a major lamp, but I did have aspirations. I hoped... at some point... to have enough money to invest in a theater troupe of my own." He sighed heavily. "My candle was extinguished by jealous colleagues. But was I not... credible in my performancei" He lifted his sweat-slick face to Matthew, and offered a faint smile.</p><p>"You are deserving of applause. From the hangman, at least."</p><p>"I take that as a backhanded compliment. allow me to deliver one of my own: you have a fair to middling mind. With some work, you might become a thinker."</p><p>"I shall take such into consideration."</p><p>"This beast." Johnstone put his hand on the convexity on his leg. "It does pain me. I am glad, in that regard, to get it off once and for all." He unbuttoned the breeches at the knee, rolled down the stocking, and began to unstrap the leather brace. all present could see that the kneecap was perfectly formed. "You're correct. It was candle wax. I spent a whole night shaping it before I was satisfied with the damn thing. Here: a trophy." He tossed the brace to the floor at Matthew's feet.</p><p>Matthew couldn't help but think it was much more palatable than the trophy of a carved-out, horrible-smelling bear's head he'd been presented with at the celebration last night. also a much more satisfying one.</p><p>Johnstone winced as he stretched the leg out straight and briskly massaged the knee. "I was suffering a muscle cramp the other night that near put me on the floor. Had to wear a similar apparatus for a role I played... oh... ten years ago. One of my last roles, with the Paradigm Players. a comedy, actually. Unfortunately there was nothing funny about it, if you discount the humor of having the audience pelt you with tomatoes and horse-shit."</p><p>"By God, I ought to strangle you myself!" Bidwell raged. "I ought to save the hangman a penny rope!"</p><p>Johnstone said, "Strangle yourself while you're at it. You were the one in such a rush to burn the woman." This statement, delivered so offhandedly, was the straw that broke Bidwell's back. The master of dead Fount Royal gave a shouted oath and lunged from his chair at Johnstone, seizing the actor's throat with both hands.</p><p>They went to the floor in a tangle and crash. at once Matthew and Winston rushed forward to disengage them, as Green looked on from his position guarding the door and Shields clung to his chair. Bidwell was pulled away from Johnstone, but not before delivering two blows that bloodied the actor's nostrils.</p><p>"Sit down, " Matthew told Bidwell, who angrily jerked out of his grasp. Winston righted Johnstone's chair and helped him into it, then immediately retreated to a corner of the library as if he feared contamination from having touched the man. Johnstone wiped his bleeding nose with his sleeve and picked up his cane, which had also fallen to the floor.</p><p>"I ought to kill you!" Bidwell shouted, the veins standing out in his neck. "Tear you to pieces myself, for what you've done!"</p><p>"The law will take care of him, sir, " Matthew said. "Now please... sit down and keep your dignity."</p><p>Reluctantly, Bidwell returned to his chair and thumped down into it. He glowered straight ahead, ideas of vengeance still crackling like flames in his mind.</p><p>"Well, you should feel very pleased with yourself, " Johnstone said to Matthew. He leaned his head back and sniffled. "The hero of the day, and all that. am I your stepping-stone to the judicial robesi"</p><p>Matthew realized Johnstone the manipulator was yet at work, trying to move him into a defensive position. "The treasure, " he said, ignoring the man's remark. "How come you to know about iti"</p><p>"I believe my nose is broken."</p><p>"The treasure, " Matthew insisted. "Now is not the time to play games."</p><p>"ah, the treasure! Yes, that." He closed his eyes and sniffled blood again. "Tell me, Matthew, have you ever set foot inside Newgate prisoni"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Pray to God you never do." Johnstone's eyes opened. "I was there for one year, three months, and twenty-eight days, serving restitution for my debts. The prisoners have the run of the place. There are guards, yes, but they withdraw for their own throats. Everyone - debtors, thieves, drunks and lunatics, murderers, child fuckers and mother rapers... they're all thrown together, like animals in a pit, and... believe me... you do what you must to survive. You know whyi"</p><p>He brought his head forward and grinned at Matthew, and when he did fresh crimson oozed from both nostrils. "Because no one... no one... cares whether you live or die but yourself. Yourself, " he hissed, and again that vulpine, cruel shadow passed quickly across his face. He nodded, his tongue flicking out and tasting the blood that glistened in the candlelight. "When they come at you - three or four at a time - and hold you down, it is not because they wish you well. I have seen men killed in such a fashion, battered until they are mortally torn inside. and still they go on, as the corpse is not yet cold. Still they go on. and you must - you must - sink to their level and join them if you wish to live another day. You must shout and shriek and howl like a beast, and strike and thrust... and want to kill... for if you show any weakness at all, they will turn upon you and it will be your broken corpse being thrown upon the garbage pile at first light."</p><p>The fox leaned toward his captor, heedless now of his bleeding nose. "Sewage runs right along the floor there. We knew it had rained outside, and how hard, when the sewage rose to our ankles. I saw two men fight to the death over a pack of playing cards. The fight ended when one drowned the other in that indescribable filth. Wouldn't that be a lovely way to end your life, Matthewi Drowned in human shiti"</p><p>"Is there a point to this recitation, siri"</p><p>"Oh, indeed there is!" Johnstone grinned broadly, blood on his lips and the shine of his eyes verging on madness. "No words are vile enough, nor do they carry enough weight of bestiality, to describe Newgate prison, but I wished you to know the circumstances in which I found myself. The days were sufficiently horri-ble... but then came the nights! Oh, the joyous bliss of the darkness! I can feel it even now! Listen!" he whispered. "Hear themi Starting to stiri Starting to crawl from their mattresses and stalk the night fantastici Hear themi The creak of a bed-frame here - and one over there, as well! Oh, listen... someone weeps! Someone calls out for God... but it is always the Devil who answers." Johnstone's savage grin faltered and slipped away.</p><p>"Even if it was so terrible a place, " Matthew said, "you still survived it."</p><p>"Did Ii" Johnstone asked, and let the question hang. He stood up, wincing as he put weight on his unbraced knee. He supported himself with his cane. "I pay for wearing that damn brace, you may be sure. Yes, I did live through Newgate prison, as I realized I might offer the assembled animals something to entertain them besides carnage. I might offer them plays. Or, rather, scenes from plays. I did all the parts, in different voices and dialects. What I didn't know I made up. They never knew the difference, nor did they care. They were particularly pleased at any scene that involved the disgrace or degradation of court officials, and as there are a pittance of those in our catalogue, I found myself concocting the scenes as I played them out. Suddenly I was a very popular man. a celebrity, among the rabble."</p><p>Johnstone stood with the cane on the floor and both hands on the cane, and Matthew realized he had - as was his nature -&nbsp;&nbsp;again taken center stage before his audience. "I came into the favor of a very large and very mean individual we called the Meatgrinder, as he... um... had used such a device to dispose of his wife's body. But - lo and behold! - he was a fan of the stagelamps! I was elevated to the prospect of command performances, and also found myself protected from the threat of harm."</p><p>as Matthew had known he sooner or later would, Johnstone now swivelled his body so as to have a view of the other men in the room. Or rather, so they would have a full view of the thes-pian's expressions. "Near the end of my term, " Johnstone went on, "I came into the acquaintance of a certain man. He was my age or therebouts, but looked very much older. He was sick, too. Coughing up blood. Well, needless to say a sick man in Newgate prison is like a warm piece of liver to wolves. It's an interesting thing to behold, actually. They beat him because he was an easy target, and also because they wanted him to go ahead and die lest they fall sick themselves. I tell you, you can learn quite a lot about the human condition at Newgate; you ought to put yourself there for a night and make a study of it."</p><p>"I'm sure there are less dangerous universities, " Matthew said.</p><p>"Yes, but none teaches as quickly as Newgate." Johnstone flashed a sharp smile. "and the lessons are very well learned. But: this man I was telling you about. He realized the Meatgrinder's power in our little community, yet the Meatgrinder was... well, he'd rather kill a man than smell his breath, shall we say. Therefore this sick and beaten individual asked me to intercede on his behalf, as a gentleman. He actually was quite educated himself. Had once been a dealer in antiques, in London. He asked me to intercede to save him further beatings or other indignities... in exchange for some very interesting information concerning a wa-terhole across the atlantic."</p><p>"ah, " Matthew said. "He knew of the treasure."</p><p>"Not only knew, he helped place the fortune there. He was a member of the crew. Oh, he told me all about it, in fascinating detail. Told me he'd never revealed it to a soul, because he was going to go back for it someday. Someday, he said. and I might be his partner and share it with him, if I would protect his life. Told me that the spring was forty feet deep, told me that the treasure had been lowered in wicker baskets and burlap bags... told enough to put a sea voyage in the mind of a poor starving ex-thespian who had no prospects, no family, and absolutely no belief in that straw poppet you call God." again, Johnstone displayed a knife-edged smile. "This man... this crewman... said there'd been a storm at sea. The ship had been wrecked. He and five or six others survived, and reached an island. Pirates being as they are, I suppose stones and coconuts did the job of knives and pistols. at last, one man survived to light a fire for a passing English frigate." Johnstone shrugged. "What did I have to lose to at least come look for myselfi Oh... he had an inscribed gold pocket watch hidden in his mattress that he also gave to me. You see, that man's name was alan Johnstone."</p><p>"What's your name, theni" Bidwell asked.</p><p>"Julius Caesar. William Shakespeare. Lord Bott Fucking Tott. Take your pick, what does it matteri"</p><p>"and what happened to the real alan Johnstonei" Matthew inquired, though he already had an idea. It had dawned on him, as well, that the turtles - reed-eaters by nature - had probably loved feasting on all those baskets and bags.</p><p>"The beatings ceased. I had to prove my worth to him. He survived for a time. Then he grew very, very ill. Sick unto death, really. I was able to get the coordinates of the waterhole's latitude and longitude from him... something I'd been trying to do for a month or more without seeming overly demanding. Then someone told the Meatgrinder that very night... someone... a little shadow of a someone... that the sick man coughing up all that blood over there in the corner... well, it was dangerous to everyone. Such disease might wipe out our little community, and we were so fond of it. By morning, alas, my partner had set off on his final voyage, alone and unlamented."</p>       <amp-ad

          </amp-ad><p>"By Christ, " Matthew said softly, his guts twisting. "Little wonder you decided to invent the witchcraft scheme. You're on regular speaking terms with Satan, aren't youi"</p><p>Johnstone - for want of a better name - laughed quietly. He threw his head back, his eyes gleaming, and laughed louder.</p><p>There was a faintly audible click.</p><p>and suddenly, moving with a speed that belied his stiff leg, Johnstone lunged forward. He pressed against Matthew's throat the pointed edge of a five-inch blade that had been concealed within the cane's shaft.</p><p>"Be still!" Johnstone hissed, his eyes boring into Matthew's. Bidwell had stood up, and now Winston and Dr. Shields rose to their feet. "Everyone, be still!"</p><p>Green crossed the threshold, pistol in hand. Johnstone reached out, grasped Matthew's shirt, and turned him so the thespian's back was to the wall and Matthew's back was in danger of a pistol ball should Green lose his head. "No, no!" Johnstone said, as if scolding a wayward pupil. "Green, stand where you are."</p><p>The red-bearded giant halted. The blade pressed perilously near entering the flesh. Though he was quaking inside, Matthew was able to keep a calm mask. "This will do you no good."</p><p>"It will do me less good to be sent to prison and have my neck stretched!" Johnstone's face was damp, a pulse beating rapidly at his temple. Blood still stained his nostrils and upper lip. "No, I can't bear that. Not prison." He shook his head with finality. "One season in Hell is enough for any man."</p><p>"You have no choice, sir. as I said, this will do you no - "</p><p>"Bidwell!" Johnstone snapped. "Get a wagon ready! Now! Green, take the pistol by the barrel. Come over here... slowly... and give it to me."</p><p>"Gentlemen, " Matthew said, "I would suggest doing neither."</p><p>"I have a knife at your throat. Do you feel iti" He gave a little jab. "Therei Would you like a sharper tastei"</p><p>"Mr. Green, " Matthew said, staring into the wild eyes of the fox. "Take a position, please, and aim your pistol at Mr. Johnstone's head."</p><p>"Christ, boy!" Bidwell shouted. "No! Green, he's crazy!"</p><p>"No further play at heroics, " Johnstone said tightly. "You've strutted your feathers, you've shown your cock, and you have blasted me with a cannon. So spare yourself, because I'm going out that door! No power on earth will ever send me back to a goddamned prison!"</p><p>"I understand your rush to avoid judgment, sir. But there are the two men with axes waiting just outside the front door."</p><p>"What two meni You're lying!"</p><p>'You see the lantern on the windowsilli Mr. Bidwell placed it there as a signal to tell the two men to take their positions."</p><p>"Name them!"</p><p>"Hiram abercrombie is one, " Bidwell answered. "Malcolm Jennings is the other."</p><p>"Well, neither of those fools could hit a horse in the head with an axe! Green, I said give me the pistol!"</p><p>"Stay where you are, Mr. Green, " Matthew said.</p><p>"Matthew!" Winston spoke up. "Don't be foolish!"</p><p>"a pistol in this man's hand will mean someone's death." Matthew kept his eyes directed into Johnstone's. Bloodhound and fox were now locked together in a duel of wills. "One bullet, one death, I assure you."</p><p>"The pistol! I won't ask again before I start cutting!"</p><p>"Oh, is this the instrumenti" Matthew asked. "The very onei Something you bought in Charles Town, I presumei"</p><p>"Damn you, you talk too fucking much!" Johnstone pushed the blade's tip into the side of Matthew's neck. The pain almost sent Matthew to his knees, and it did bring tears to his eyes and make him clench his teeth. In fact, his whole body clenched. But he was damned if he'd cry out or otherwise display agony. The blade had entered only a fraction of an inch, deep enough to cause warm blood to well out and trickle down his neck, but it had not nicked an artery. Matthew knew Johnstone was simply raising the stakes in their game.</p><p>"Would you like a little more of iti" Johnstone asked.</p><p>Bidwell had positioned himself to one side of the men, and therefore saw the blood. "For God's sake!" he brayed. "Green! Give him the pistol!"</p><p>Before Matthew could protest, he heard Green's clumping boots behind him and the pistol's grip was offered to Johnstone. The weapon was instantly snatched into Johnstone's hand, but the blade remained exactly where it was, blood-deep and drinking.</p><p>"The wagon, Bidwell!" Johnstone demanded, now aiming the pistol at Matthew's midsection. "Get it ready!"</p><p>"Yes, do get it ready." Matthew was speaking with an effort. It wasn't every day he talked with a knife blade in his neck. "and while you're at it, fix the wheels so they'll fall off two hours or so down the road. Why don't you take a single horse, Johnstonei That way it can step into a rut in the dark, throw you, and break your neck and be done with it. Oh... wait! Why don't you simply go through the swampi I know some lovely suckpits that would be glad to take your boots."</p><p>"Shut up! I want a wagon! I want a wagon, because you're going with me!"</p><p>"Oh ho!" With an even greater effort, Matthew forced himself to grin. "Sir, you're an excellent comedian after all!"</p><p>"You think this is funnyi" Johnstone's face was contorted with rage. He blew spittle. "Shall you laugh harder through the slit in your throat or the hole in your guti"</p><p>"The real question is: shall you laugh, when your intended hostage is on the floor and your pistol is emptyi"</p><p>Johnstone's mouth opened. No sound emerged, but a silver thread of saliva broke over his lower lip and fell like the undoing of a spider's web.</p><p>Carefully, Matthew took a backward step. The blade's tip slid from his neck. "Your problem, sir, " he said as he pressed his fingers to the small wound, "is that your friends and associates seem to have short spans of life. If I were to accompany you in a wagon, my own life span would be dramatically reduced. So: I dislike the idea of dying - greatly dislike it - but since I shall certainly die somewhere if I follow your wishes, it would be better to die here. That way, at least, the sterling gentlemen in this room may rush you and end this hopeless fantasy of escape you have seized upon. But actually, I don't think anyone would mind if you were to run for it.</p><p>Just go. Out the front door. I swear I'll be silent. Of course, Mr. Bidwell, Mr. Green - or even Mrs. Nettles, whom I see there in the doorway - might shout a warning to the axemen. Let me think." He frowned. "Two axes, versus a knife and one bullet. Yes, you might get past them. Then you could go to... well, where would you go, Mr. Johnstonei You see, that's the thorny part: where would you goi"</p><p>Johnstone said nothing. He still pointed both the pistol and knife, but his eyes had blurred like a frost on the fount in midwinter.</p><p>"Oh!" Matthew nodded for emphasis. "Through the forest, why don't youi The Indians will grant you safe passage, I'm sure. But you see my conditioni I unfortunately met a bear and was nearly killed. Then again, you do have a knife and a single bullet. But... oh... what shall you do for foodi Well, you have the knife and bullet. Best take matches, and a lamp. Best go to your house and pack for your trip, and we'll be waiting at the gate to give you a fine farewell. Run along, now!"</p><p>Johnstone did not move.</p><p>"Oh, my, " Matthew said quietly. He looked from the pistol to the blade and back again. "all dressed up, and nowhere to go."</p><p>"I'm... not... "Johnstone shook his head from side to side, in the manner of a gravely wounded animal. "I'm not... done. Not done."</p><p>"Hm, " Matthew said. "Picture the theatre, sir. The applause has been given, the bows taken. The audience has gone home. The stagelamps are ever so slowly extinguished. They gave a beautiful dream of light, didn't theyi The sets are dismantled, the costumes folded and retired. Someone comes to sweep the stage, and even yesterday's dust is carried away." He listened to the harsh rising and falling of Johnstone's chest.</p><p>"The play, " Matthew said, "is over." an anxious silence reigned, and none dared challenge it.</p><p>at last Matthew decided a move had to be made. He had seen that the knife's cutting edge had small teeth, which would have severed arteries and vocal cords with one or two swift, unexpected slashes. Especially if one came up behind the victim, clasped a hand over the mouth, and pulled the head back to better offer the throat. Perhaps this wasn't the original cane Johnstone had first brought with him to Fount Royal, but one he'd had made in either Charles Town or England after he'd determined how the murders were to be done.</p><p>Matthew held out his hand, risking a blade stab. "Would you give me the pistol, pleasei" Johnstone's face looked soft and swollen by raging inner pressures. He seemed not to realize Matthew had spoken, but was simply staring into space.</p><p>"Siri" Matthew prompted. "You won't be needing the pistol."</p><p>"Uh, " Johnstone said. "Uh." His mouth opened, closed, and opened again. The gasping of an air-drowning fish. Then, in a heartbeat, the consciousness and fury leapt into Johnstone's eyes once more and he backed away two steps, nearly meeting the wall. Behind him was the fanciful map of Fount Royal, with its elegant streets and rows of houses, quiltwork farms, immense orchards, precise naval yard and piers, and at the town's center the life-giving spring.</p><p>Johnstone said, "No. I shall not."</p><p>"Listen to me!" Bidwell urged. "There's no point to this! Matthew's right, there's nowhere for you to go!"</p><p>"I shall not, " Johnstone repeated. "Shall not. Return to prison. No. Never."</p><p>"Unfortunately, " Matthew said, "you have no choice in the matter."</p><p>"Finally!" Johnstone smiled, but it was a terrible, skull-like grimace. "Finally, you speak a misstatement! So you're not as smart as you think, are youi"</p><p>"Pardon mei"</p><p>"a misstatement, " he repeated, his voice thickened. "Tell me: though I... know my script was flawed... did I at least play an adequate rolei"</p><p>"You did, sir. Especially the night the schoolhouse burned. I was taken with your grief."</p><p>Johnstone gave a deep, bitter chuckling that might have briefly wandered into the territory of tears. "That was the only time I wasn't acting, boy! It killed my soul to see the schoolhouse burn!"</p><p>"Whati It really mattered so much to youi"</p><p>"You don't know. You see... I actually enjoyed being a teacher. It was like acting, in a way. But... there was greater worth in it, and the audience was always appreciative, I told myself... if I couldn't find any more of the treasure than what I'd discovered... I could stay here, and I could be alan Johnstone the schoolmaster. For the rest of my days." He stared at the pistol in his hand. "Not long after that, I brought the ruby ring up. and it set me aflame again... about why I was really here." He lifted his face and looked at Matthew. He stared at Winston, Dr. Shields, and Bidwell all in turn.</p><p>"Please put aside the pistol, " Matthew said. "I think it's time."</p><p>"Time. Yes, " Johnstone repeated, nodding. "It is time. I can't go back to prison. Do you understand thati"</p><p>"Siri" Matthew now realized with a surge of alarm what the man intended. "There's no need!"</p><p>"My need." Johnstone dropped the knife to the floor and put his foot on it. "You were correct about something, Matthew: if I was given the pistol..." He paused, beginning to waver on his feet as if he might pass out. "Someone had to die."</p><p>Suddenly Johnstone turned the weapon toward his face, which brought a gasp of shock from Bidwell. "I do have a choice, you see, " Johnstone said, the sweat glistening on his cheeks in the red-cast candlelight. "and damn you all to Hell, where I shall be waiting with eager arms.</p><p>"and now, " he said, with a slight tilting forward of his head, "exit the actor."</p><p>He opened his mouth, slid the pistol's barrel into it, squeezed his eyes tightly shut, and pulled the trigger.</p><p>There was a loud metallic clack as the wheel-lock mechanism was engaged. a shower of sparks flew, hissing like little comets, into Johnstone's face.</p><p>The pistol, however, failed to fire.</p><p>Johnstone opened his eyes, displaying an expression of such terror that Matthew hoped never to witness its like again. He withdrew the gun from his mouth. Something inside the weapon was making a chirrupy cricket sound. Tendrils of blue smoke spun through the air around Johnstone's face, as he looked into the gun's barrel. another spark jumped, bright as a gold coin.</p><p>Crack! went the pistol, like a mallet striking a board.</p><p>Johnstone's head rocked back. The eyes were wide open, wet, and brimming with shock. Matthew saw blood and reddish-gray clumps of matter clinging to the wall behind Johnstone's skull. The map of Bidwell's Fount Royal had in an instant become gore-drenched and brain-spattered.</p><p>Johnstone fell, his knees folding. at the end, an instant before he hit the floor, he might have been giving a final, arrogant bow.</p><p>and then his head hit the planks, and from that gruesome hole in the back of it, directly opposite the only slightly tidier hole in his forehead, streamed the physical matter of the thes-pian's memories, schemes, acting ability, intelligence, pride, fear of prison, desires, evil, and...</p><p>Yes, even his affinity for teaching. Even that, now only so much liquid.</p> </div> </div> <div class="row turn-page"> <a class="col-xs-2" href="/Speaks%20the%20Nightbird%20(Matthew%20Corbett%20%231)/42.html?v=1662298105979">Previous</a> <a class="col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:center;" href="/Speaks%20the%20Nightbird%20(Matthew%20Corbett%20%231)/book.html?v=1662298105978">Table</a> <a class="col-xs-2 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:right;" href="/Speaks%20the%20Nightbird%20(Matthew%20Corbett%20%231)/44.html?v=1662298105980"> Next</a> </div> <hr></div><hr><footer class="container"> <p>© Company 2014</p></footer><amp-lightbox id="searchLightbox" class="-il" layout="nodisplay" on="lightboxOpen:searchInput.focus; lightboxClose:searchTriggerOpen.focus" scrollable="" hidden="hidden"> <div> <div class="-ic" role="button" tabindex="0" on="tap:searchLightbox.close"></div> <div class="-ih"> <div class="-sg -sb" on="tap: searchLightbox.close, AMP.setState({ query: '' }), searchForm.clear" role="button" tabindex="0"> <div class="ap-a-ico -sw"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#close"></use> </svg> </div> </div> <div class="ap-o-search-field"> <form action="#" action-xhr="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/echo" class="-ip" id="searchForm" on="submit:AMP.setState({ query: throttledValue }),searchResult.focus" target="_top"> <amp-autocomplete class="-id" filter="substring" min-characters="1" on="select:AMP.setState({ query: event.value })" submit-on-enter="false" src="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/autosuggest"> <div class="ap-a-ico -im"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#search"></use> </svg> </div> <input id="searchInput" class="-iv" name="q" placeholder="What are you looking for?" on="input-throttled:AMP.setState({ throttledValue: event.value })" required=""> <button class="-ig" type="submit" name="search-submit" disabled="" [disabled]="!throttledValue">Search </button> <div role="listbox"></div> </amp-autocomplete> </form> <div class="empty" [class]="query ?
