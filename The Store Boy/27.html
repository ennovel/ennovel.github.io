He didn't intend to redeem the glass, and if found in his possession, it would bring him under suspicion. Now that a detective had the matter in charge, it occurred to him that it would be well to have the ticket found in Ben's room.</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The two had rooms upon the same floor, and it would, therefore, be easy to slip into Ben's chamber and leave it somewhere about.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Now, it chanced that Susan, the chambermaid, was about, though Conrad did not see her, when he carried out his purpose, and, instigated by curiosity, she peeped through the half-open door, and saw him place the ticket on the bureau.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Wondering what it was, she entered the room after Conrad had vacated it, and found the ticket Conrad had placed there.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Susan knew what a pawnbroker's ticket was, and read it with curiosity.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She saw that it was made out to Ben Barclay.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How, then, did Master Conrad get hold of it?" she said to herself. "It's my belief he's trying to get Master Ben into trouble. It's a shame, it is, for Master Ben is a gentleman and he isn't."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Between the two boys, Susan favored Ben, who always treated her with consideration, while Conrad liked to order about the servants, as if they were made to wait upon him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 After Conrad had disposed of the pawn ticket, he said carelessly to his mother:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Mother, if I were you, I'd look into Ben's room. You might find the opera glass there."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I don't think he'd leave it there. He would pawn it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then you might find the ticket somewhere about."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Upon this hint, Mrs. Hill went up to Ben's room, and there, upon the bureau, she naturally found the ticket.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I thought so," she said to herself. "Conrad was right. The boy is a thief. Here is the ticket made out to him by name. Well, well, he's brazen enough, in all conscience. Now shall I show it to Cousin Hamilton at once, or shall I wait until the detective has reported?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 On the whole, Mrs. Hill decided to wait. She could delay with safety, for she had proof which would utterly crush and confound the hated interloper.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Meanwhile, the detective pursued his investigations. Of course, he visited Simpson's, and there he learned that the opera glass, which he readily recognized from the description, had been brought there a few days previous.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Who brought it?" he asked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "A boy of about sixteen."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Did he give his name?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The books were referred to, and the attendant answered in the affirmative.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He gave the name of Ben Barclay," he answered.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you think that was his real name?" asked the detective.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That depends on whether he had a right to pawn it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Suppose he stole it?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then, probably, he did not give his real name."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "So I think," said Mr. Lynx quietly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you know if there is a boy by that name?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "There is; but I doubt if he knows anything about the matter."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I will call again, perhaps to-morrow," he added. "I must report to my principal what I have discovered."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 From Simpson's he went straight to Mrs. Hamilton, who had as yet received no communication from the housekeeper.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, Mr. Lynx," she asked, with interest, "have you heard anything of the glass?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have seen it," was the quiet reply.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Where?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "At a well-known pawnshop on the Bowery."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Did you learn who left it?" asked Mrs. Hamilton eagerly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "A boy--about sixteen years of age--who gave the name of Ben Barclay."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I can't believe Ben would be guilty of such a disgraceful act!" ejaculated Mrs. Hamilton, deeply moved.
