<p>Susan drew in her breath with an amount of expression not easily described, further relieving her feelings with a smart cough, answered, 'Very quiet indeed, Miss Floy, no doubt. Excessive so.'</p> 
<p>'When I was a child,' said Florence, thoughtfully, and after musing for some moments, 'did you ever see that gentleman who has taken the trouble to ride down here to speak to me, now three times - three times, I think, Susan?'</p> 
<p>'Three times, Miss,' returned the Nipper. 'Once when you was out a walking with them Sket- '</p> 
<p>Florence gently looked at her, and Miss Nipper checked herself.</p> 
<p>'With Sir Barnet and his lady, I mean to say, Miss, and the young gentleman. And two evenings since then.'</p> 
<p>'When I was a child, and when company used to come to visit Papa, did you ever see that gentleman at home, Susan?' asked Florence.</p> 
<p>'Well, Miss,' returned her maid, after considering, 'I really couldn't say I ever did. When your poor dear Ma died, Miss Floy, I was very new in the family, you see, and my element:' the Nipper bridled, as opining that her merits had been always designedly extinguished by Mr Dombey: 'was the floor below the attics.'</p> 
<p>'To be sure,' said Florence, still thoughtfully; 'you are not likely to have known who came to the house. I quite forgot.'</p> 
<p>'Not, Miss, but what we talked about the family and visitors,' said Susan, 'and but what I heard much said, although the nurse before Mrs Richards make unpleasant remarks when I was in company, and hint at little Pitchers, but that could only be attributed, poor thing,' observed Susan, with composed forbearance, 'to habits of intoxication, for which she was required to leave, and did.'</p> 
<p>Florence, who was seated at her chamber window, with her face resting on her hand, sat looking out, and hardly seemed to hear what Susan said, she was so lost in thought.</p> 
<p>'At all events, Miss,' said Susan, 'I remember very well that this same gentleman, Mr Carker, was almost, if not quite, as great a gentleman with your Papa then, as he is now. It used to be said in the house then, Miss, that he was at the head of all your Pa's affairs in the City, and managed the whole, and that your Pa minded him more than anybody, which, begging your pardon, Miss Floy, he might easy do, for he never minded anybody else. I knew that, Pitcher as I might have been.'</p> 
<p>Susan Nipper, with an injured remembrance of the nurse before Mrs Richards, emphasised 'Pitcher' strongly.</p> 
<p>'And that Mr Carker has not fallen off, Miss,' she pursued, 'but has stood his ground, and kept his credit with your Pa, I know from what is always said among our people by that Perch, whenever he comes to the house; and though he's the weakest weed in the world, Miss Floy, and no one can have a moment's patience with the man, he knows what goes on in the City tolerable well, and says that your Pa does nothing without Mr Carker, and leaves all to Mr Carker, and acts according to Mr Carker, and has Mr Carker always at his elbow, and I do believe that he believes (that washiest of Perches!) that after your Pa, the Emperor of India is the child unborn to Mr Carker.'</p> 
<p>Not a word of this was lost on Florence, who, with an awakened interest in Susan's speech, no longer gazed abstractedly on the prospect without, but looked at her, and listened with attention.</p> 
<p>'Yes, Susan,' she said, when that young lady had concluded. 'He is in Papa's confidence, and is his friend, I am sure.'</p> 
<p>Florence's mind ran high on this theme, and had done for some days. Mr Carker, in the two visits with which he had followed up his first one, had assumed a confidence between himself and her - a right on his part to be mysterious and stealthy, in telling her that the ship was still unheard of - a kind of mildly restrained power and authority over her - that made her wonder, and caused her great uneasiness. She had no means of repelling it, or of freeing herself from the web he was gradually winding about her; for that would have required some art and knowledge of the world, opposed to such address as his; and Florence had none. True, he had said no more to her than that there was no news of the ship, and that he feared the worst; but how he came to know that she was interested in the ship, and why he had the right to signify his knowledge to her, so insidiously and darkly, troubled Florence very much.</p> 
<p>This conduct on the part of Mr Carker, and her habit of often considering it with wonder and uneasiness, began to invest him with an uncomfortable fascination in Florence's thoughts. A more distinct remembrance of his features, voice, and manner: which she sometimes courted, as a means of reducing him to the level of a real personage, capable of exerting no greater charm over her than another: did not remove the vague impression. And yet he never frowned, or looked upon her with an air of dislike or animosity, but was always smiling and serene.</p> 
<p>Again, Florence, in pursuit of her strong purpose with reference to her father, and her steady resolution to believe that she was herself unwittingly to blame for their so cold and distant relations, would recall to mind that this gentleman was his confidential friend, and would think, with an anxious heart, could her struggling tendency to dislike and fear him be a part of that misfortune in her, which had turned her father's love adrift, and left her so alone? She dreaded that it might be; sometimes believed it was: then she resolved that she would try to conquer this wrong feeling; persuaded herself that she was honoured and encouraged by the notice of her father's friend; and hoped that patient observation of him and trust in him would lead her bleeding feet along that stony road which ended in her father's heart.</p> 
<p>Thus, with no one to advise her - for she could advise with no one without seeming to complain against him - gentle Florence tossed on an uneasy sea of doubt and hope; and Mr Carker, like a scaly monster of the deep, swam down below, and kept his shining eye upon her. Florence had a new reason in all this for wishing to be at home again. Her lonely life was better suited to her course of timid hope and doubt; and she feared sometimes, that in her absence she might miss some hopeful chance of testifying her affection for her father. Heaven knows, she might have set her mind at rest, poor child! on this last point; but her slighted love was fluttering within her, and, even in her sleep, it flew away in dreams, and nestled, like a wandering bird come home, upon her father's neck.</p> 
<p>Of Walter she thought often. Ah! how often, when the night was gloomy, and the wind was blowing round the house! But hope was strong in her breast. It is so difficult for the young and ardent, even with such experience as hers, to imagine youth and ardour quenched like a weak flame, and the bright day of life merging into night, at noon, that hope was strong yet. Her tears fell frequently for Walter's sufferings; but rarely for his supposed death, and never long.</p> 
<p>She had written to the old Instrument-maker, but had received no answer to her note: which indeed required none. Thus matters stood with Florence on the morning when she was going home, gladly, to her old secluded life.</p> 
<p>Doctor and Mrs Blimber, accompanied (much against his will) by their valued charge, Master Barnet, were already gone back to Brighton, where that young gentleman and his fellow-pilgrims to Parnassus were then, no doubt, in the continual resumption of their studies. The holiday time was past and over; most of the juvenile guests at the villa had taken their departure; and Florence's long visit was come to an end.</p> 
<p>There was one guest, however, albeit not resident within the house, who had been very constant in his attentions to the family, and who still remained devoted to them. This was Mr Toots, who after renewing, some weeks ago, the acquaintance he had had the happiness of forming with Skettles Junior, on the night when he burst the Blimberian bonds and soared into freedom with his ring on, called regularly every other day, and left a perfect pack of cards at the hall-door; so many indeed, that the ceremony was quite a deal on the part of Mr Toots, and a hand at whist on the part of the servant.</p> 
<p>Mr Toots, likewise, with the bold and happy idea of preventing the family from forgetting him (but there is reason to suppose that this expedient originated in the teeming brain of the Chicken), had established a six-oared cutter, manned by aquatic friends of the Chicken's and steered by that illustrious character in person, who wore a bright red fireman's coat for the purpose, and concealed the perpetual black eye with which he was afflicted, beneath a green shade. Previous to the institution of this equipage, Mr Toots sounded the Chicken on a hypothetical case, as, supposing the Chicken to be enamoured of a young lady named Mary, and to have conceived the intention of starting a boat of his own, what would he call that boat? The Chicken replied, with divers strong asseverations, that he would either christen it Poll or The Chicken's Delight. Improving on this idea, Mr Toots, after deep study and the exercise of much invention, resolved to call his boat The Toots's Joy, as a delicate compliment to Florence, of which no man knowing the parties, could possibly miss the appreciation.</p> 
<p>Stretched on a crimson cushion in his gallant bark, with his shoes in the air, Mr Toots, in the exercise of his project, had come up the river, day after day, and week after week, and had flitted to and fro, near Sir Barnet's garden, and had caused his crew to cut across and across the river at sharp angles, for his better exhibition to any lookers-out from Sir Barnet's windows, and had had such evolutions performed by the Toots's Joy as had filled all the neighbouring part of the water-side with astonishment. But whenever he saw anyone in Sir Barnet's garden on the brink of the river, Mr Toots always feigned to be passing there, by a combination of coincidences of the most singular and unlikely description.</p> 
<p>'How are you, Toots?' Sir Barnet would say, waving his hand from the lawn, while the artful Chicken steered close in shore.</p> 
<p>'How de do, Sir Barnet?' Mr Toots would answer, What a surprising thing that I should see you here!'</p> 
<p>Mr Toots, in his sagacity, always said this, as if, instead of that being Sir Barnet's house, it were some deserted edifice on the banks of the Nile, or Ganges.</p> 
<p>'I never was so surprised!' Mr Toots would exclaim. - 'Is Miss Dombey there?'</p> 
<p>Whereupon Florence would appear, perhaps.</p> 
<p>'Oh, Diogenes is quite well, Miss Dombey,' Toots would cry. 'I called to ask this morning.'</p> 
<p>'Thank you very much!' the pleasant voice of Florence would reply.</p> 
<p>'Won't you come ashore, Toots?' Sir Barnet would say then. 'Come! you're in no hurry. Come and see us.'</p> 
<p>'Oh, it's of no consequence, thank you!' Mr Toots would blushingly rejoin. 'I thought Miss Dombey might like to know, that's all. Good-bye!' And poor Mr Toots, who was dying to accept the invitation, but hadn't the courage to do it, signed to the Chicken, with an aching heart, and away went the Joy, cleaving the water like an arrow.</p> 
<p>The Joy was lying in a state of extraordinary splendour, at the garden steps, on the morning of Florence's departure. When she went downstairs to take leave, after her talk with Susan, she found Mr Toots awaiting her in the drawing-room.</p> 
<p>'Oh, how de do, Miss Dombey?' said the stricken Toots, always dreadfully disconcerted when the desire of his heart was gained, and he was speaking to her; 'thank you, I'm very well indeed, I hope you're the same, so was Diogenes yesterday.'</p> 
<p>'You are very kind,' said Florence.</p> 
<p>'Thank you, it's of no consequence,' retorted Mr Toots. 'I thought perhaps you wouldn't mind, in this fine weather, coming home by water, Miss Dombey. There's plenty of room in the boat for your maid.'</p> 
<p>'I am very much obliged to you,' said Florence, hesitating. 'I really am - but I would rather not.'</p> 
<p>'Oh, it's of no consequence,' retorted Mr Toots. 'Good morning.'</p> 
<p>'Won't you wait and see Lady Skettles?' asked Florence, kindly.</p> 
<p>'Oh no, thank you,' returned Mr Toots, 'it's of no consequence at all.'</p> 
<p>So shy was Mr Toots on such occasions, and so flurried! But Lady Skettles entering at the moment, Mr Toots was suddenly seized with a passion for asking her how she did, and hoping she was very well; nor could Mr Toots by any possibility leave off shaking hands with her, until Sir Barnet appeared: to whom he immediately clung with the tenacity of desperation.</p> 
<p>'We are losing, today, Toots,' said Sir Barnet, turning towards Florence, 'the light of our house, I assure you'</p> 
<p>'Oh, it's of no conseq - I mean yes, to be sure,' faltered the embarrassed Mr Toots. 'Good morning!'</p> 
<p>Notwithstanding the emphatic nature of this farewell, Mr Toots, instead of going away, stood leering about him, vacantly. Florence, to relieve him, bade adieu, with many thanks, to Lady Skettles, and gave her arm to Sir Barnet.</p> 
<p>'May I beg of you, my dear Miss Dombey,' said her host, as he conducted her to the carriage, 'to present my best compliments to your dear Papa?'</p> 
<p>It was distressing to Florence to receive the commission, for she felt as if she were imposing on Sir Barnet by allowing him to believe that a kindness rendered to her, was rendered to her father. As she could not explain, however, she bowed her head and thanked him; and again she thought that the dull home, free from such embarrassments, and such reminders of her sorrow, was her natural and best retreat.</p> 
<p>Such of her late friends and companions as were yet remaining at the villa, came running from within, and from the garden, to say good-bye. They were all attached to her, and very earnest in taking leave of her. Even the household were sorry for her going, and the servants came nodding and curtseying round the carriage door. As Florence looked round on the kind faces, and saw among them those of Sir Barnet and his lady, and of Mr Toots, who was chuckling and staring at her from a distance, she was reminded of the night when Paul and she had come from Doctor Blimber's: and when the carriage drove away, her face was wet with tears.</p> 
<p>Sorrowful tears, but tears of consolation, too; for all the softer memories connected with the dull old house to which she was returning made it dear to her, as they rose up. How long it seemed since she had wandered through the silent rooms: since she had last crept, softly and afraid, into those her father occupied: since she had felt the solemn but yet soothing influence of the beloved dead in every action of her daily life! This new farewell reminded her, besides, of her parting with poor Walter: of his looks and words that night: and of the gracious blending she had noticed in him, of tenderness for those he left behind, with courage and high spirit. His little history was associated with the old house too, and gave it a new claim and hold upon her heart. Even Susan Nipper softened towards the home of so many years, as they were on their way towards it. Gloomy as it was, and rigid justice as she rendered to its gloom, she forgave it a great deal. 'I shall be glad to see it again, I don't deny, Miss,' said the Nipper. 'There ain't much in it to boast of, but I wouldn't have it burnt or pulled down, neither!'</p> 
<p>'You'll be glad to go through the old rooms, won't you, Susan?' said Florence, smiling.</p> 
<p>'Well, Miss,' returned the Nipper, softening more and more towards the house, as they approached it nearer, 'I won't deny but what I shall, though I shall hate 'em again, to-morrow, very likely.'</p> 
<p>Florence felt that, for her, there was greater peace within it than elsewhere. It was better and easier to keep her secret shut up there, among the tall dark walls, than to carry it abroad into the light, and try to hide it from a crowd of happy eyes. It was better to pursue the study of her loving heart, alone, and find no new discouragements in loving hearts about her. It was easier to hope, and pray, and love on, all uncared for, yet with constancy and patience, in the tranquil sanctuary of such remembrances: although it mouldered, rusted, and decayed about her: than in a new scene, let its gaiety be what it would. She welcomed back her old enchanted dream of life, and longed for the old dark door to close upon her, once again.</p> 
<p>Full of such thoughts, they turned into the long and sombre street. Florence was not on that side of the carriage which was nearest to her home, and as the distance lessened between them and it, she looked out of her window for the children over the way.</p> 
<p>She was thus engaged, when an exclamation from Susan caused her to turn quickly round.</p> 
<p>'Why, Gracious me!' cried Susan, breathless, 'where's our house!'</p> 
<p>'Our house!' said Florence.</p> 
<p>Susan, drawing in her head from the window, thrust it out again, drew it in again as the carriage stopped, and stared at her mistress in amazement.</p> 
<p>There was a labyrinth of scaffolding raised all round the house, from the basement to the roof. Loads of bricks and stones, and heaps of mortar, and piles of wood, blocked up half the width and length of the broad street at the side. Ladders were raised against the walls; labourers were climbing up and down; men were at work upon the steps of the scaffolding; painters and decorators were busy inside; great rolls of ornamental paper were being delivered from a cart at the door; an upholsterer's waggon also stopped the way; no furniture was to be seen through the gaping and broken windows in any of the rooms; nothing but workmen, and the implements of their several trades, swarming from the kitchens to the garrets. Inside and outside alike: bricklayers, painters, carpenters, masons: hammer, hod, brush, pickaxe, saw, and trowel: all at work together, in full chorus!</p> 
<p>Florence descended from the coach, half doubting if it were, or could be the right house, until she recognised Towlinson, with a sun-burnt face, standing at the door to receive her.</p> 
<p>'There is nothing the matter?' inquired Florence.</p> 
<p>'Oh no, Miss.'</p> 
<p>'There are great alterations going on.'</p> 
<p>'Yes, Miss, great alterations,' said Towlinson.</p> 
<p>Florence passed him as if she were in a dream, and hurried upstairs. The garish light was in the long-darkened drawing-room and there were steps and platforms, and men In paper caps, in the high places. Her mother's picture was gone with the rest of the moveables, and on the mark where it had been, was scrawled in chalk, 'this room in panel. Green and gold.' The staircase was a labyrinth of posts and planks like the outside of the house, and a whole Olympus of plumbers and glaziers was reclining in various attitudes, on the skylight. Her own room was not yet touched within, but there were beams and boards raised against it without, baulking the daylight. She went up swiftly to that other bedroom, where the little bed was; and a dark giant of a man with a pipe in his mouth, and his head tied up in a pocket-handkerchief, was staring in at the window.</p> 
<p>It was here that Susan Nipper, who had been in quest of Florence, found her, and said, would she go downstairs to her Papa, who wished to speak to her.</p> 
<p>'At home! and wishing to speak to me!' cried Florence, trembling.</p> 
<p>Susan, who was infinitely more distraught than Florence herself, repeated her errand; and Florence, pale and agitated, hurried down again, without a moment's hesitation. She thought upon the way down, would she dare to kiss him? The longing of her heart resolved her, and she thought she would.</p> 
<p>Her father might have heard that heart beat, when it came into his presence. One instant, and it would have beat against his breast.</p> 
<p>But he was not alone. There were two ladies there; and Florence stopped. Striving so hard with her emotion, that if her brute friend Di had not burst in and overwhelmed her with his caresses as a welcome home - at which one of the ladies gave a little scream, and that diverted her attention from herself - she would have swooned upon the floor.</p> 
<p>'Florence,' said her father, putting out his hand: so stiffly that it held her off: 'how do you do?'</p> 
<p>Florence took the hand between her own, and putting it timidly to her lips, yielded to its withdrawal. It touched the door in shutting it, with quite as much endearment as it had touched her.</p> 
<p>'What dog is that?' said Mr Dombey, displeased.</p> 
<p>'It is a dog, Papa - from Brighton.'</p> 
<p>'Well!' said Mr Dombey; and a cloud passed over his face, for he understood her.</p> 
<p>'He is very good-tempered,' said Florence, addressing herself with her natural grace and sweetness to the two lady strangers. 'He is only glad to see me. Pray forgive him.'</p> 
<p>She saw in the glance they interchanged, that the lady who had screamed, and who was seated, was old; and that the other lady, who stood near her Papa, was very beautiful, and of an elegant figure.</p> 
<p>'Mrs Skewton,' said her father, turning to the first, and holding out his hand, 'this is my daughter Florence.'</p> 
<p>'Charming, I am sure,' observed the lady, putting up her glass. 'So natural! My darling Florence, you must kiss me, if you please.'</p> 
<p>Florence having done so, turned towards the other lady, by whom her father stood waiting.</p> 
<p>'Edith,' said Mr Dombey, 'this is my daughter Florence. Florence, this lady will soon be your Mama.'</p> 
<p>Florence started, and looked up at the beautiful face in a conflict of emotions, among which the tears that name awakened, struggled for a moment with surprise, interest, admiration, and an indefinable sort of fear. Then she cried out, 'Oh, Papa, may you be happy! may you be very, very happy all your life!' and then fell weeping on the lady's bosom.</p> 
<p>There was a short silence. The beautiful lady, who at first had seemed to hesitate whether or no she should advance to Florence, held her to her breast, and pressed the hand with which she clasped her, close about her waist, as if to reassure her and comfort her. Not one word passed the lady's lips. She bent her head down over Florence, and she kissed her on the cheek, but she said no word.</p> 
<p>'Shall we go on through the rooms,' said Mr Dombey, 'and see how our workmen are doing? Pray allow me, my dear madam.'</p> 
<p>He said this in offering his arm to Mrs Skewton, who had been looking at Florence through her glass, as though picturing to herself what she might be made, by the infusion - from her own copious storehouse, no doubt - of a little more Heart and Nature. Florence was still sobbing on the lady's breast, and holding to her, when Mr Dombey was heard to say from the Conservatory:</p> 
<p>'Let us ask Edith. Dear me, where is she?'</p> 
<p>'Edith, my dear!' cried Mrs Skewton, 'where are you? Looking for Mr Dombey somewhere, I know. We are here, my love.'</p> 
<p>The beautiful lady released her hold of Florence, and pressing her lips once more upon her face, withdrew hurriedly, and joined them. Florence remained standing In the same place: happy, sorry, joyful, and in tears, she knew not how, or how long, but all at once: when her new Mama came back, and took her in her arms again.</p> 
<p>'Florence,' said the lady, hurriedly, and looking into her face with great earnestness. 'You will not begin by hating me?'</p> 
<p>'By hating you, Mama?' cried Florence, winding her arm round her neck, and returning the look.</p> 
<p>'Hush! Begin by thinking well of me,' said the beautiful lady. 'Begin by believing that I will try to make you happy, and that I am prepared to love you, Florence. Good-bye. We shall meet again soon. Good-bye! Don't stay here, now.'</p> 
<p>Again she pressed her to her breast she had spoken in a rapid manner, but firmly - and Florence saw her rejoin them in the other room. And now Florence began to hope that she would learn from her new and beautiful Mama, how to gaIn her father's love; and in her sleep that night, in her lost old home, her own Mama smiled radiantly upon the hope, and blessed it. Dreaming Florence!</p> 
<p>“苏珊，这一天终于来到了，”弗洛伦斯对极好的尼珀说道，“我们又要回到我们安静的家里去了！”</p> 
<p>苏珊露出难以描述的丰富表情，吸进一口气，然后又有力地咳嗽了一声，来缓和她的感情，回答道，“确实很安静，弗洛伊小姐，这是没有疑问的。非常安静。”</p> 
<p>“当我是个孩子的时候，”弗洛伦斯沉思了一会儿以后，若有所思地问道，“您有没有看见过那位不怕麻烦，到现在已有三次骑马到这里来跟我谈话的先生？我想有三次了吧，苏珊？”</p> 
<p>“三次了，小姐，”尼珀回答道，“有一次他们邀您出去散步，这些斯克特——”</p> 
<p>弗洛伦斯温和地看了她一下，尼珀小姐就克制住自己。</p> 
<p>“小姐，我是想说，巴尼特爵士和他夫人以及那位年轻的先生。从那次以后，他又在晚上来了两次。”</p> 
<p>“当我是个小孩子，客人们前来拜访爸爸的时候，您在家里看到过那位先生吗，苏珊？”弗洛伦斯问道。</p> 
<p>“唔，小姐，”她的侍女考虑之后回答道，“我确实不好说我是不是看到过他。您知道，您可怜的妈妈死的时候，弗洛伊小姐，我刚刚上您家来，我的活动范围，”尼珀仰起头来，好像是抱怨董贝先生经常故意看不起她的劳绩似的，“就在顶楼下面。”</p> 
<p>“是的，”弗洛伦斯依旧深思地说道，“您大概不会知道谁到我们家里来过。我是完全忘记了。”</p> 
<p>“当然，小姐，我们也谈论主人和客人，”苏珊说道，“我当然还听到不少谈话，虽然当我跟她们在一起的时候，理查兹大嫂以前的保姆曾经讲过一些令人不愉快的话，暗示说，有长耳朵的小水罐①什么的，可是这只能怪她本人爱把自己灌醉，这可怜的人，”苏珊带着镇静的、宽容的神情，说道，“她就因为这个缘故被解雇了，她也就走了。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>①长耳朵的小水罐：英国谚语，意指小孩子耳朵尖。</p> 
<p>弗洛伦斯坐在卧室的窗口，手支托着脸，向外看着，似乎没有听见苏珊说了些什么；她深深地陷在沉思中了。</p> 
<p>“不管怎么样，小姐，”苏珊说，“我记得很清楚，那时候，这位卡克先生在您爸爸的心目中是一位重要的人物；即使不说跟现在一样，也跟现在差不多。那时候，小姐，我在屋子里经常听说，他在您爸爸城里的公司里是个头，一切事情都归他管，您爸爸器重他超过任何人，这一点，弗洛伊小姐，请您原谅，他很容易这样做，因为他从来不重视其他人。我知道这，因为我也许是个长耳朵的水罐，听到别人这么说。”</p> 
<p>苏珊·尼珀委屈地回想起理查兹大嫂以前的保姆，说到“长耳朵的水罐”时有力地加重了语气。</p> 
<p>“他们还谈到卡克先生没有失宠，小姐，”她继续说道，“而是牢牢地保持住自己的地位，继续受到您爸爸的信任。这些我是从那位珀奇那里听到的。他每到这里来的时候，总要到我们这些人中间聊天，虽然他是世界上最没骨气的人，弗洛伊小姐，谁也没有耐性跟他相处一分钟，可是他对城里发生的事情倒知道得很多。他说，您爸爸不论做什么事，都离不开卡克先生，一切事情都交给卡克先生去办理，一切都按照卡克先生的意见去做，并让卡克先生老跟随在他的身边。照我看，在珀奇心目中，除了您爸爸之外，印度皇帝跟卡克先生相比还是个没出生的孩子呢。”</p> 
<p>这些话弗洛伦斯没有听漏一个字；她对苏珊的谈话产生了兴趣，不再心不在焉地望着窗外的景物，而是看着她，并注意地听着她。</p> 
<p>“是的，苏珊，”当那位姑娘讲完时，她说道，“我相信，他得到爸爸的信任，而且是他的朋友。”</p> 
<p>弗洛伦斯的思想集中在这个问题上，好几天也离不开它。卡克先生在接着第一次拜访之后而来的两次拜访中，装出他和她相互信任似的，并装出他有权神秘地和悄悄地告诉她，那条船还是下落不明，而且他对她有一种稍稍加以克制的权力和影响，这使她感到奇怪，并使她心中产生极大的不安。她无法拒绝它，使她自己从他逐渐缠绕在她身上的蜘蛛网中解脱出来；因为那需要掌握这世界的某种策略和知识，才能对抗他的这种诡计，而弗洛伦斯却没有掌握。不错，他除了对她说那条船杳无音讯，并说，他担心会发生最坏的结果之外，并没有再说别的，但是他怎么知道她关心这条船，为什么他有权利那么阴险地、恶毒地把他知道的事情告诉给她呢，弗洛伦斯对这感到苦恼不安。</p> 
<p>卡克先生的这种行为以及她经常怀疑和不安地思考它的习惯，开始使他在弗洛伦斯的思想中具有一种很令人不愉快的魔力。有时，为了使他成为一个真实的人，不能比其他人对她施加更大的魔力，她就想方设法，更清楚地回忆起他的面貌、声音和神态，可是这样做，并不能消除她心中那模糊的印象。然而他却从不皱眉蹙额，也从不露出厌恶或敌意的神态来看她，而总是笑容满脸，安详自若。</p> 
<p>另一方面，弗洛伦斯由于强烈地怀抱着要达到重新赢得她父亲喜爱的目的，并坚决相信她自己非出本意地应对他们父女之间如此冷淡与疏远的关系负责，因此她会想到，这位先生是她父亲知心的朋友；她还会忧虑地想到，她对他产生厌恶和恐惧的思想会不会是她促使她父亲不爱她并造成她如此孤独的不幸原因之一呢？她担心可能是这样；有时她相信就正是这样。于是她就决心克服这种错误的感情，使她自己相信，她父亲的朋友的关注对她来说是光荣和鼓励；并希望对他进行耐心的观察和信任将会引导她的流血的双脚走过那坎坷不平的道路，通向她父亲的心。</p> 
<p>就这样，没有人给她出主意——因为她要跟人商量，似乎就像是抱怨父亲似的——，温柔的弗洛伦斯在怀疑与希望的不平静的海洋上颠簸着；卡克先生则像是深海中有鳞的妖怪一样在下面游着，闪闪发光的眼睛一直在注视着她。</p> 
<p>弗洛伦斯在这一切之中，又有了一个希望重新回家的新理由。孤独的生活更适合于她怀有胆怯的希望与怀疑的过程；她有时担心，当她不在家的时候，她也许会错过向她父亲表明她的爱心的好机会。天知道，她可以在这最后的一点上让她的心安静下来，可怜的孩子！可是她那受到冷落的爱正在她的心中跳动，它甚至在她睡眠时飞了出去，像一只在外游荡的鸟儿飞回家一样，安息在她父亲的脖子上。</p> 
<p>她时常思念沃尔特。啊！当夜色朦胧，风在屋外吹刮的时候，她曾经多少次想到了他啊！但是她心中怀着强烈的希望。对于年轻和感情热烈的人——甚至像她那样经验不多的人——来说，很难想象青春与热忱会像微弱的火焰一样熄灭，生命的白天会在中午就被黑夜吞没，因此，希望在她心中仍然是强烈的。她时常为沃尔特所遭受的苦难而流泪，但却很少为他假定的死亡而流泪，时间也从来不长久。</p> 
<p>她曾经写信给年老的仪器制造商，但却没有得到回音，但她在信中并没有要求回复。那天早上弗洛伦斯高高兴兴地准备回家去过她以往的隐居生活的时候，她的情况就是这样。</p> 
<p>布林伯博士和夫人，在他们尊贵的弟子巴尼特少爷的陪同（这是十分违反他心愿的）下，早已回到布赖顿；这位小先生和跟他同去帕纳萨斯朝圣的伴侣们无疑早已在那里继续他们的攻读。假期早已过去了；别墅中大部分年轻的客人们都已离开；弗洛伦斯这长时间的拜访也将要结束了。</p> 
<p>不过，有一位客人虽然没有居住在巴尼特爵士的家里，但却始终如一地对这家人表示关切，并仍和过去一样对他们忠心耿耿。这就是图茨先生。他在挣脱布林伯枷锁，并戴着戒指高飞进自由王国的那一天晚上，有幸认识了小斯克特尔斯；他在几个星期以前重叙了这一交情之后，每隔一天就准时前来看望一次，并在门厅的门口留下一大堆名片；名片的数量实在多极了，因此这个表示礼仪的方式使人想起了惠斯特牌①，图茨先生像是在配牌，仆人则像是个玩牌的对手。</p> 
<p>图茨先生为了使这家人不会忘记他，还采用了一个大胆的、巧妙的主意（不过，有理由设想，这个办法是从斗鸡足智多谋的脑袋中产生的）：他购置了一条六个桨的单桅帆船；斗鸡的水上运动的朋友们充任船员，那位杰出的英雄亲自把舵；他为了这个目的穿了一件鲜红的消防队员的短外衣，并用绿色的遮阳掩盖眼睛周围永久性的青紫斑；在给这条船装备用品之前，图茨先生曾试探斗鸡对这样一个假想的情况的意见：假定斗鸡迷恋上一位名叫玛丽的姑娘，心里正打算自己弄一条船，那么他将把那条船取个什么名字呢？斗鸡斩钉截铁、发誓赌咒地回答说，他将把它命名为“波尔”②或“斗鸡的喜悦”。图茨先生把这个想法加以改进，在深深思索并充分发挥创造才能之后，决定把他的单桅帆船称为“图茨的欢乐”——这是对弗洛伦斯的巧妙颂辞，凡是知道他们的人没有一个不对它表示赞许的。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>①惠斯持（whist）牌：由4人成局的一种纸牌戏，共有52张牌，以2人为1组，两组相对。桥脾就是由惠斯特牌发展出来的。</p> 
<p>②波尔（Poll）是玛丽（Mary）的小称。</p> 
<p>图茨先生躺在他的华丽的帆船中的一个深红色的靠垫上，脚跷在空中，在执行他的计划的过程中，一天又一天，一星期又一星期，向上游划来，在巴尼特爵士花园附近来来去去；他命令他的船员们一次又一次沿着锐角方向穿过河流，以便从巴尼特爵士窗口往外看的人们可以更好地看到他；他还让“图茨的欢乐”进行各种演习，使河岸附近的居民看得目瞪口呆。可是每当他看到巴尼特爵士花园里的什么人待在河边的时候，图茨先生总是假装成由于一些情况的巧合而划过那里，这种巧合是非常离奇古怪和不大可能发生的。</p> 
<p>“您好吗，图茨？”巴尼特爵士会从草坪上向他挥着手，说道。这时机灵的斗鸡就直向岸边划去。</p> 
<p>“您好，巴尼特爵士！”图茨先生回答道，“多么令人惊奇的事呀，我会在这里遇见您！”</p> 
<p>图茨先生以他特有的聪明，经常这样说，仿佛这里不是巴尼特爵士的住宅，而是尼罗河或恒河上的一座什么荒废的大厦似的。</p> 
<p>“我从没感到这么惊奇的！”图茨先生会惊叫道，“董贝小姐在这里吗？”</p> 
<p>也许弗洛伦斯随后就会到这里来。</p> 
<p>“啊，戴奥吉尼斯很健康，董贝小姐，”图茨先生会喊道，“今天早上我去打听过。”</p> 
<p>“非常感谢您！”弗洛伦斯会用愉快的声音回答道。</p> 
<p>“您不上岸来吗，图茨！”巴尼特爵士这时会这样说，“上来吧！您又不急着上什么地方去。来看看我们吧。”</p> 
<p>“哦，这无关紧要，谢谢您！”图茨先生会红着脸回答道，“我想董贝小姐也许会高兴知道这个情况；我要说的都说完了。再见吧！”可怜的图茨先生真盼望能接受这个邀请，但却又没有这样的勇气，所以就怀着痛苦的心情，向斗鸡打了个手势，于是“欢乐”就离开了，像箭一般地破浪前进。</p> 
<p>弗洛伦斯要离开这里的这天早晨，“欢乐”装饰得十分豪华，停泊在花园的台阶旁边。当弗洛伦斯跟苏珊谈话以后下楼去告别时，她发现图茨先生正在客厅里等待她。</p> 
<p>“您好，董贝小姐！”感动的图茨说道；当他心中的愿望得到满足的时候，他经常可怕地仓皇失措；这时他对她说道，“谢谢您，我确实很健康，我希望您也一样，戴奥吉尼斯昨天也是这样。”</p> 
<p>“谢谢您的好意，”弗洛伦斯说。</p> 
<p>“谢谢您，这无关紧要，”图茨先生回答道，“今天天气很好，我想您也许不会反对从水路回家吧，董贝小姐。船里宽敞得很，您的侍女也可以跟您同船走。”</p> 
<p>“我十分感谢您，”弗洛伦斯迟疑地说道，“我确实感谢，不过——我不想那样走。”</p> 
<p>“哦，这无关紧要，”图茨先生回答道，“早上好。”</p> 
<p>“您不等一下，看看斯克特尔斯夫人吗？”弗洛伦斯亲切地问道。</p> 
<p>“哦不，谢谢您，”图茨先生说道，“这根本无关紧要。”</p> 
<p>图茨先生在这种场合下是这么害羞，这么慌张啊！可是斯克特尔斯夫人就在这时候进来了，图茨先生突然想要问问她好吗，并祝她健康；图茨先生跟她握手的时候怎么也下不了决心把手放下，直到巴尼特爵士来到为止；一看到巴尼特爵士，图茨先生就立刻紧紧地把他抓住。</p> 
<p>“图茨，”巴尼特爵士朝着弗洛伦斯说道，“我肯定地对您说，我们今天将失去屋子里的明灯了。”</p> 
<p>“哦，这无关紧要——我是想说，您说得完全不错，”局促不安的图茨结结巴巴地说道，“再见吧！”</p> 
<p>图茨先生尽管这样有声有色地作了告别，但却没有走开，而是原地站着不动，并斜着眼睛，茫然地看着四周。弗洛伦斯为了使他摆脱困境，就开始向斯克特尔斯夫人告别，说了很多感谢的话，同时把胳膊向巴尼特爵士伸去。</p> 
<p>“我亲爱的董贝小姐，”她的主人把她送上四轮马车的时候，说道，“我请您向您亲爱的爸爸转达我最亲切的问候，可以吗？”</p> 
<p>弗洛伦斯接受这项任务是痛苦的，因为她觉得她如果要使他相信，他对她所表示的好意就是对她爸爸所表示的好意，那么这就欺骗了巴尼特爵士。不过因为她不能解释，所以她就低下头去向他表示感谢，这时她又重新想起那沉闷无趣的家可以使她从这些使她感到尴尬、引起她悲伤的事情中解脱出来，因此它是她自然的和最好的藏身场所。</p> 
<p>她新近交上的朋友们和伴侣们，有些依旧住在别墅里，他们都从房屋里和花园中跑来向她告别。他们全都和她依依不舍，十分诚挚地跟她分手。甚至连仆人们也对她的离去感到惋惜；他们聚集在马车门口向她点头和行屈膝礼。当弗洛伦斯看着四周亲切的脸孔，在这些脸孔中间看到了巴尼特爵士和夫人的脸孔，看到了站在远处正在吃吃笑着和注视着她的图茨先生的脸孔时，她想起了那天夜里保罗和她离开布林伯博士的学校回家时的情景；当马车离开他们向前奔跑的时候，她的脸孔都被泪水沾湿了。</p> 
<p>这是悲伤的眼泪，但这也是带来安慰的眼泪，因为当与她现在正要回去的那座沉闷无趣的老房屋有关的所有美好的回忆涌上心头的时候，它们使她感到这座老房屋十分亲切。自从她在那些寂静无声的房间中漫步穿行以来，自从她最后一次轻轻地、害怕地偷偷走进她父亲的那些房间以来，自从她在日常生活的一举一动之间都感觉到死去的亲爱的弟弟的庄严而又抚慰的影响以来，似乎已经过去了多么长久的时间了啊！这次新的告别还使她想起了她跟可怜的沃尔特的离别，想起了他那天夜间的神情和话语，想起了她曾注意到他既对留在后面的人们怀着亲切的感情，但同时却又表露出勇气和高兴；他的短短的历史也是和这座古老的房屋联系着的，这使这座房屋具有一种新的权利来要求获得和支配她的心。</p> 
<p>当她们行进在回家的路途中时，甚至连苏珊·尼珀对这居住了许多年的家的态度也温和起来了。虽然它是阴郁的，她对它的阴郁曾进行过严厉而中肯的指责，可是她大大地原谅它了。“我不否认，小姐，我将高兴再看到它，”尼珀说，“虽然它没有什么可夸耀的，可是我却不愿意它被火烧了，也不愿意它被拆毁了！”</p> 
<p>“你将高兴穿过那些老房间，是不是，苏珊？”弗洛伦斯笑嘻嘻地问道。</p> 
<p>“唔，小姐，”苏珊回答道；当她们愈来愈接近这座房屋的时候，她对它的态度也愈来愈温和了，“我不想否认，我将高兴穿过它们，不过很可能，明天我又会恨它们了。”</p> 
<p>弗洛伦斯觉得，她住在家里比住在其他任何地方都更感到安宁。在家里，在这些高高的、黑暗的墙壁中间，把她心中的秘密深深地隐藏起来，比把它带到外面明亮的光线中，试图避开许多幸福的眼睛的注意，要好得多和容易得多。怀着爱的心在这里孤独地进行探索，不会因为看到周围怀着爱的心而感到新的气馁，这要好得多；在充满这些回忆的平静的圣堂内去希望，去祈祷，去热爱，比在一个不论有多少欢乐的新环境中要容易得多，虽然在她的四周，圣堂的墙壁已经朽坏了，腐蚀了，枯烂了；虽然她还会像过去一样得不到关怀，但她可以怀着恒心和耐性。她欢迎回到她那具有魅力的往昔生活的梦幻中，盼望过去那黑黑的大门再一次把她关进里面去。</p> 
<p>满怀着这些思想，她们转进了那条长长的和幽暗的街道。弗洛伦斯不是坐在马车中最靠近她的家的那一边，当她们离家的距离愈来愈近的时候，她从窗口向外望出去，想看看住在对面的那些孩子们。</p> 
<p>她正在这样注意看着的时候，苏珊高声喊叫了一声，促使她迅速地回过头来。</p> 
<p>“嗳呀，天哪！”苏珊气喘吁吁地喊道，“我们的家在哪里呀！”</p> 
<p>“我们的家！”弗洛伦斯说道。</p> 
<p>当马车停住的时候，苏珊刚把头从窗外缩进来，这时又重新探出去，然后又把头缩回来，吃惊地呆呆地看着她的女主人。</p> 
<p>房屋四周，从底层到屋顶，竖立着纵横交错的脚手架。屋旁宽阔的街道有一半宽和一半长的地方都被一堆堆砖石、一堆堆灰浆和一堆堆木材堵塞住了；一些梯子竖靠在墙上，工人们爬上、爬下；另一些工人正在脚手架的踏板上工作；油漆工和室内装饰工则在屋子里忙碌着。一大卷一大卷的装饰用纸正从门口的一辆大车中卸下；家具商的一辆货车也挡住了道路；从裂着口的破窗子往里看，房间中没有任何家具；所能看到的只是工人们和他们的工具挤满了从厨房到顶楼的各个地方。屋里屋外都一样：砌砖工、油漆工、木匠、石匠；锤子、灰沙斗、刷子、镐、锯、铁瓦刀——全都一齐工作着。</p> 
<p>弗洛伦斯下了马车，心中半信半疑，这究竟是不是她的家，直到后来她认出了脸被晒得黑黑的托林森正在门口迎接她。</p> 
<p>“没出什么事吧？”弗洛伦斯问道。</p> 
<p>“哦，没有，小姐。”</p> 
<p>“这里正发生着很大的变化啊。”</p> 
<p>“是的，小姐，很大的变化，”托林森说道。</p> 
<p>弗洛伦斯仿佛在梦中似地走过他身旁，急急忙忙跑上楼去。耀眼的光线充满了过去长期黑暗的客厅，在高处可以看到梯子、踏板和戴着纸帽子的工人。她母亲的画像已经和其他家具一道搬走了，在原先挂像的地方潦草地涂写着几个粉笔字：“这间房间要镶上护墙板，绿色和金黄色的。”楼梯间像屋外一样，一片纵横交错的柱子和木板；一群白铁工和玻璃工像奥林匹斯山上的群神①一样，在天窗上弯下身子，以各种不同的姿势操作着。她自己的房间里面暂时还没有触动，但是房子外面支立着梁杆和木板，阻挡阳光从窗户射进去。她迅速走上另一间摆着小床的房间去，一位皮肤黝黑的大汉，嘴巴里衔着一支烟管，头上包扎着一块手绢，正在窗口张大眼睛往里看。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>①奥斯匹斯山（Olympus）：希腊北部泰撒来和马其顿交界处山脉东头的高山，据传说，太古时代希腊的十二个大神就住在这个山上。</p> 
<p>一直在寻找弗洛伦斯的苏珊·尼珀，就在这里找到了她，并建议她下楼到她爸爸那里去；他希望跟她说话。</p> 
<p>“他在家！还希望跟我说话！”弗洛伦斯颤抖地喊道。</p> 
<p>苏珊比弗洛伦斯更加心神错乱，又把她的使命重说了一遍；弗洛伦斯脸色苍白，心情激动，没有片刻迟疑，就急急忙忙跑下楼去。在下楼的路途中想：她敢不敢吻他呢？心中难以抑制的愿望使她下定了决心，她想她敢。</p> 
<p>当她走到她父亲面前的时候，他也许会听到她的心在跳动。再过一瞬间，它就要贴在他的胸前跳动了。</p> 
<p>可是他不是一个人。那里还有两位夫人；弗洛伦斯站住了。她心情斗争得十分激烈，如果这时她那粗野的朋友戴没有冲进房间，亲热地抚摸着她的全身，表示欢迎她回家的话，那么她真会晕倒在地板上的。其中有一位夫人看到这个情景，轻轻地尖叫了一声，这转移了弗洛伦斯对自己的注意力。</p> 
<p>“弗洛伦斯，”她的父亲向她伸出手，说道；那冷冰冰的神态，使她不禁在原地站住，不敢再走向前去，“你好吗？”</p> 
<p>弗洛伦斯把他的手握在自己的双手中，胆怯地把它拉近嘴唇，当它抽回去的时候，她不敢违抗地顺从了。他走去关门，这手刚才接触到她时就跟现在接触到门时一样冷淡。</p> 
<p>“这条狗是怎么回事？”董贝先生不高兴地问道。</p> 
<p>“这条狗，爸爸，是从布赖顿来的。”</p> 
<p>“唔！”董贝先生说道，这时一朵阴云掠过他的脸孔，因为他明白她的意思。</p> 
<p>“他的脾气很好，”弗洛伦斯以她生性具有的优雅和亲切的态度，向这两位夫人致意道，“他只是看到我觉得高兴。请原谅他。”</p> 
<p>她在跟她们交换眼光的时候，看到那位刚才发出尖叫声并坐着的夫人已经老了，另一位站在她爸爸身旁的夫人长得很美丽，而且身材优雅。</p> 
<p>“斯丘顿夫人，”她爸爸转向第一位夫人，指着弗洛伦斯，说道，“这是我的女儿弗洛伦斯。”</p> 
<p>“真的，她非常可爱，”那位夫人举起长柄眼镜看着她，说道，“多么自然！我亲爱的弗洛伦斯，你一定得亲我一下，好吗？”</p> 
<p>弗洛伦斯这样做了，然后转向另一位夫人，她爸爸站在她身边等待着。</p> 
<p>“伊迪丝，”董贝先生说道，“这是我的女儿弗洛伦斯。弗洛伦斯，这位夫人不久就是你的妈妈了。”</p> 
<p>弗洛伦斯吃了一惊，抬起眼睛，望着那张美丽的脸孔，心中充满了各种矛盾的情绪；在这当中，妈妈这个名词所唤出的眼泪在一刹那间跟惊异、好奇、羡慕和说不出的恐惧斗争着。然后，她喊道，“啊，爸爸，祝你幸福！祝你一辈子非常、非常幸福！”接着，她哭着扑向这位夫人的怀里。</p> 
<p>随后是短时间的沉默。那位美丽的夫人最初似乎有些犹豫，是不是要向前朝弗洛伦斯走去，这时她把她抱在怀里，紧紧地握着她紧抱住她腰身的手，仿佛让她放心和在安慰她。这位夫人一句话也没有说。她向弗洛伦斯低下头，吻着她的脸颊，但却没有说话。</p> 
<p>“我们是不是到这些房间去走走，”董贝先生说道，“看看我们这些工人活干得怎么样了？请允许我，我亲爱的夫人。”</p> 
<p>他一边说，一边向斯丘顿夫人伸出胳膊；斯丘顿夫人这时正用长柄眼镜看着弗洛伦斯，好像正在心中琢磨着，如果在弗洛伦斯身上注入稍多一些心灵与自然——当然是从她自己的仓库中取来的——的话，那么她会成为一个什么样的人呢。弗洛伦斯依旧伏在那位夫人的胸前哭泣，并紧抱着她，这时听到董贝先生从暖房中说道：</p> 
<p>“让我问问伊迪丝。哎呀，她在哪里呀？”</p> 
<p>“伊迪丝，我亲爱的！”斯丘顿夫人喊道，“你在哪里？她一定正在找董贝先生，我知道。我们在这里哪，我亲爱的。”</p> 
<p>美丽的夫人放松了她对弗洛伦斯的拥抱，又一次把嘴唇紧贴在她的脸上，然后急忙走出房间，参加到他们当中。弗洛伦斯一动不动地站在原来的地方：幸福、悲伤、高兴、流泪。当她的新妈妈回来又把她抱在怀中的时候，她不知道这是怎么发生的，也不知道时间过去了多久，只知道这一切都是同时发生的。</p> 
<p>“弗洛伦斯，”这位夫人极为恳切地注视着她的脸孔，急忙说道，“你不会一开始就恨我吧？”</p> 
<p>“恨你，妈妈？”弗洛伦斯用胳膊搂着她的脖子，注视着她，喊道。</p> 
<p>“轻一些！一开始往好里想我吧，”美丽的夫人说道，“开始相信我将设法使你幸福，相信我是准备爱你的，弗洛伦斯。再见，我们很快就会再见面的。再见吧！现在别待在这里。”</p> 
<p>她又把她抱在胸前，刚才的这些话她是急促地说出的，但语气却是坚决的。弗洛伦斯看到她在另一间房间里参加到他们当中。</p> 
<p>现在弗洛伦斯开始希望，她将向她美丽的新妈妈学习怎样博得她父亲的喜爱；当她在这个跟原来很不一样的家中睡觉的时候，她的新妈妈满面春风地向着她的这个希望微笑着，并为它祝福。充满了梦想的弗洛伦斯啊！</p>
