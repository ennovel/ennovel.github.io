<p>Such a Midshipman he seemed to be, at least, in the then position of domestic affairs. Walter eyed him kindly many a time in passing in and out; and poor old Sol, when Walter was not there, would come and lean against the doorpost, resting his weary wig as near the shoe-buckles of the guardian genius of his trade and shop as he could. But no fierce idol with a mouth from ear to ear, and a murderous visage made of parrot's feathers, was ever more indifferent to the appeals of its savage votaries, than was the Midshipman to these marks of attachment.</p> 
<p>Walter's heart felt heavy as he looked round his old bedroom, up among the parapets and chimney-pots, and thought that one more night already darkening would close his acquaintance with it, perhaps for ever. Dismantled of his little stock of books and pictures, it looked coldly and reproachfully on him for his desertion, and had already a foreshadowing upon it of its coming strangeness. 'A few hours more,' thought Walter, 'and no dream I ever had here when I was a schoolboy will be so little mine as this old room. The dream may come back in my sleep, and I may return waking to this place, it may be: but the dream at least will serve no other master, and the room may have a score, and every one of them may change, neglect, misuse it.'</p> 
<p>But his Uncle was not to be left alone in the little back parlour, where he was then sitting by himself; for Captain Cuttle, considerate in his roughness, stayed away against his will, purposely that they should have some talk together unobserved: so Walter, newly returned home from his last day's bustle, descended briskly, to bear him company.</p> 
<p>'Uncle,' he said gaily, laying his hand upon the old man's shoulder, 'what shall I send you home from Barbados?'</p> 
<p>'Hope, my dear Wally. Hope that we shall meet again, on this side of the grave. Send me as much of that as you can.'</p> 
<p>'So I will, Uncle: I have enough and to spare, and I'll not be chary of it! And as to lively turtles, and limes for Captain Cuttle's punch, and preserves for you on Sundays, and all that sort of thing, why I'll send you ship-loads, Uncle: when I'm rich enough.'</p> 
<p>Old Sol wiped his spectacles, and faintly smiled.</p> 
<p>'That's right, Uncle!' cried Walter, merrily, and clapping him half a dozen times more upon the shoulder. 'You cheer up me! I'll cheer up you! We'll be as gay as larks to-morrow morning, Uncle, and we'll fly as high! As to my anticipations, they are singing out of sight now.</p> 
<p>'Wally, my dear boy,' returned the old man, 'I'll do my best, I'll do my best.'</p> 
<p>'And your best, Uncle,' said Walter, with his pleasant laugh, 'is the best best that I know. You'll not forget what you're to send me, Uncle?'</p> 
<p>'No, Wally, no,' replied the old man; 'everything I hear about Miss Dombey, now that she is left alone, poor lamb, I'll write. I fear it won't be much though, Wally.'</p> 
<p>'Why, I'll tell you what, Uncle,' said Walter, after a moment's hesitation, 'I have just been up there.'</p> 
<p>'Ay, ay, ay?' murmured the old man, raising his eyebrows, and his spectacles with them.</p> 
<p>'Not to see her,' said Walter, 'though I could have seen her, I daresay, if I had asked, Mr Dombey being out of town: but to say a parting word to Susan. I thought I might venture to do that, you know, under the circumstances, and remembering when I saw Miss Dombey last.'</p> 
<p>'Yes, my boy, yes,' replied his Uncle, rousing himself from a temporary abstraction.</p> 
<p>'So I saw her,' pursued Walter, 'Susan, I mean: and I told her I was off and away to-morrow. And I said, Uncle, that you had always had an interest in Miss Dombey since that night when she was here, and always wished her well and happy, and always would be proud and glad to serve her in the least: I thought I might say that, you know, under the circumstances. Don't you think so ?'</p> 
<p>'Yes, my boy, yes,' replied his Uncle, in the tone as before.</p> 
<p>'And I added,' pursued Walter, 'that if she - Susan, I mean - could ever let you know, either through herself, or Mrs Richards, or anybody else who might be coming this way, that Miss Dombey was well and happy, you would take it very kindly, and would write so much to me, and I should take it very kindly too. There! Upon my word, Uncle,' said Walter, 'I scarcely slept all last night through thinking of doing this; and could not make up my mind when I was out, whether to do it or not; and yet I am sure it is the true feeling of my heart, and I should have been quite miserable afterwards if I had not relieved it.'</p> 
<p>His honest voice and manner corroborated what he said, and quite established its ingenuousness.</p> 
<p>'So, if you ever see her, Uncle,' said Walter, 'I mean Miss Dombey now - and perhaps you may, who knows! - tell her how much I felt for her; how much I used to think of her when I was here; how I spoke of her, with the tears in my eyes, Uncle, on this last night before I went away. Tell her that I said I never could forget her gentle manner, or her beautiful face, or her sweet kind disposition that was better than all. And as I didn't take them from a woman's feet, or a young lady's: only a little innocent child's,' said Walter: 'tell her, if you don't mind, Uncle, that I kept those shoes - she'll remember how often they fell off, that night - and took them away with me as a remembrance!'</p> 
<p>They were at that very moment going out at the door in one of Walter's trunks. A porter carrying off his baggage on a truck for shipment at the docks on board the Son and Heir, had got possession of them; and wheeled them away under the very eye of the insensible Midshipman before their owner had well finished speaking.</p> 
<p>But that ancient mariner might have been excused his insensibility to the treasure as it rolled away. For, under his eye at the same moment, accurately within his range of observation, coming full into the sphere of his startled and intensely wide-awake look-out, were Florence and Susan Nipper: Florence looking up into his face half timidly, and receiving the whole shock of his wooden ogling!</p> 
<p>More than this, they passed into the shop, and passed in at the parlour door before they were observed by anybody but the Midshipman. And Walter, having his back to the door, would have known nothing of their apparition even then, but for seeing his Uncle spring out of his own chair, and nearly tumble over another.</p> 
<p>'Why, Uncle!' exclaimed Walter. 'What's the matter?'</p> 
<p>Old Solomon replied, 'Miss Dombey!'</p> 
<p>'Is it possible?' cried Walter, looking round and starting up in his turn. 'Here!'</p> 
<p>Why, It was so possible and so actual, that, while the words were on his lips, Florence hurried past him; took Uncle Sol's snuff-coloured lapels, one in each hand; kissed him on the cheek; and turning, gave her hand to Walter with a simple truth and earnestness that was her own, and no one else's in the world!</p> 
<p>'Going away, Walter!' said Florence.</p> 
<p>'Yes, Miss Dombey,' he replied, but not so hopefully as he endeavoured: 'I have a voyage before me.'</p> 
<p>'And your Uncle,' said Florence, looking back at Solomon. 'He is sorry you are going, I am sure. Ah! I see he is! Dear Walter, I am very sorry too.'</p> 
<p>'Goodness knows,' exclaimed Miss Nipper, 'there's a many we could spare instead, if numbers is a object, Mrs Pipchin as a overseer would come cheap at her weight in gold, and if a knowledge of black slavery should be required, them Blimbers is the very people for the sitiwation.'</p> 
<p>With that Miss Nipper untied her bonnet strings, and alter looking vacantly for some moments into a little black teapot that was set forth with the usual homely service on the table, shook her head and a tin canister, and began unasked to make the tea.</p> 
<p>In the meantime Florence had turned again to the Instrument-maker, who was as full of admiration as surprise. 'So grown!' said old Sol. 'So improved! And yet not altered! Just the same!'</p> 
<p>'Indeed!' said Florence.</p> 
<p>'Ye - yes,' returned old Sol, rubbing his hands slowly, and considering the matter half aloud, as something pensive in the bright eyes looking at him arrested his attention. 'Yes, that expression was in the younger face, too!'</p> 
<p>'You remember me,' said Florence with a smile, 'and what a little creature I was then?'</p> 
<p>'My dear young lady,' returned the Instrument-maker, 'how could I forget you, often as I have thought of you and heard of you since! At the very moment, indeed, when you came in, Wally was talking about you to me, and leaving messages for you, and - '</p> 
<p>'Was he?' said Florence. 'Thank you, Walter! Oh thank you, Walter! I was afraid you might be going away and hardly thinking of me;' and again she gave him her little hand so freely and so faithfully that Walter held it for some moments in his own, and could not bear to let it go.</p> 
<p>Yet Walter did not hold it as he might have held it once, nor did its touch awaken those old day-dreams of his boyhood that had floated past him sometimes even lately, and confused him with their indistinct and broken shapes. The purity and innocence of her endearing manner, and its perfect trustfulness, and the undisguised regard for him that lay so deeply seated in her constant eyes, and glowed upon her fair face through the smile that shaded - for alas! it was a smile too sad to brighten - it, were not of their romantic race. They brought back to his thoughts the early death-bed he had seen her tending, and the love the child had borne her; and on the wings of such remembrances she seemed to rise up, far above his idle fancies, into clearer and serener air.</p> 
<p>'I - I am afraid I must call you Walter's Uncle, Sir,' said Florence to the old man, 'if you'll let me.'</p> 
<p>'My dear young lady,' cried old Sol. 'Let you! Good gracious!'</p> 
<p>'We always knew you by that name, and talked of you,' said Florence, glancing round, and sighing gently. 'The nice old parlour! Just the same! How well I recollect it!'</p> 
<p>Old Sol looked first at her, then at his nephew, and then rubbed his hands, and rubbed his spectacles, and said below his breath, 'Ah! time, time, time!'</p> 
<p>There was a short silence; during which Susan Nipper skilfully impounded two extra cups and saucers from the cupboard, and awaited the drawing of the tea with a thoughtful air.</p> 
<p>'I want to tell Walter's Uncle,' said Florence, laying her hand timidly upon the old man's as it rested on the table, to bespeak his attention, 'something that I am anxious about. He is going to be left alone, and if he will allow me - not to take Walter's place, for that I couldn't do, but to be his true friend and help him if I ever can while Walter is away, I shall be very much obliged to him indeed. Will you? May I, Walter's Uncle?'</p> 
<p>The Instrument-maker, without speaking, put her hand to his lips, and Susan Nipper, leaning back with her arms crossed, in the chair of presidency into which she had voted herself, bit one end of her bonnet strings, and heaved a gentle sigh as she looked up at the skylight.</p> 
<p>'You will let me come to see you,' said Florence, 'when I can; and you will tell me everything about yourself and Walter; and you will have no secrets from Susan when she comes and I do not, but will confide in us, and trust us, and rely upon us. And you'll try to let us be a comfort to you? Will you, Walter's Uncle?'</p> 
<p>The sweet face looking into his, the gentle pleading eyes, the soft voice, and the light touch on his arm made the more winning by a child's respect and honour for his age, that gave to all an air of graceful doubt and modest hesitation - these, and her natural earnestness, so overcame the poor old Instrument-maker, that he only answered:</p> 
<p>'Wally! say a word for me, my dear. I'm very grateful.'</p> 
<p>'No, Walter,' returned Florence with her quiet smile. 'Say nothing for him, if you please. I understand him very well, and we must learn to talk together without you, dear Walter.'</p> 
<p>The regretful tone in which she said these latter words, touched Walter more than all the rest.</p> 
<p>'Miss Florence,' he replied, with an effort to recover the cheerful manner he had preserved while talking with his Uncle, 'I know no more than my Uncle, what to say in acknowledgment of such kindness, I am sure. But what could I say, after all, if I had the power of talking for an hour, except that it is like you?'</p> 
<p>Susan Nipper began upon a new part of her bonnet string, and nodded at the skylight, in approval of the sentiment expressed.</p> 
<p>'Oh! but, Walter,' said Florence, 'there is something that I wish to say to you before you go away, and you must call me Florence, if you please, and not speak like a stranger.'</p> 
<p>'Like a stranger!' returned Walter, 'No. I couldn't speak so. I am sure, at least, I couldn't feel like one.'</p> 
<p>'Ay, but that is not enough, and is not what I mean. For, Walter,' added Florence, bursting into tears, 'he liked you very much, and said before he died that he was fond of you, and said "Remember Walter!" and if you'll be a brother to me, Walter, now that he is gone and I have none on earth, I'll be your sister all my life, and think of you like one wherever we may be! This is what I wished to say, dear Walter, but I cannot say it as I would, because my heart is full.'</p> 
<p>And in its fulness and its sweet simplicity, she held out both her hands to him. Walter taking them, stooped down and touched the tearful face that neither shrunk nor turned away, nor reddened as he did so, but looked up at him with confidence and truth. In that one moment, every shadow of doubt or agitation passed away from Walter's soul. It seemed to him that he responded to her innocent appeal, beside the dead child's bed: and, in the solemn presence he had seen there, pledged himself to cherish and protect her very image, in his banishment, with brotherly regard; to garner up her simple faith, inviolate; and hold himself degraded if he breathed upon it any thought that was not in her own breast when she gave it to him.</p> 
<p>Susan Nipper, who had bitten both her bonnet strings at once, and imparted a great deal of private emotion to the skylight, during this transaction, now changed the subject by inquiring who took milk and who took sugar; and being enlightened on these points, poured out the tea. They all four gathered socially about the little table, and took tea under that young lady's active superintendence; and the presence of Florence in the back parlour, brightened the Tartar frigate on the wall.</p> 
<p>Half an hour ago Walter, for his life, would have hardly called her by her name. But he could do so now when she entreated him. He could think of her being there, without a lurking misgiving that it would have been better if she had not come. He could calmly think how beautiful she was, how full of promise, what a home some happy man would find in such a heart one day. He could reflect upon his own place in that heart, with pride; and with a brave determination, if not to deserve it - he still thought that far above him - never to deserve it less</p> 
<p>Some fairy influence must surely have hovered round the hands of Susan Nipper when she made the tea, engendering the tranquil air that reigned in the back parlour during its discussion. Some counter-influence must surely have hovered round the hands of Uncle Sol's chronometer, and moved them faster than the Tartar frigate ever went before the wind. Be this as it may, the visitors had a coach in waiting at a quiet corner not far off; and the chronometer, on being incidentally referred to, gave such a positive opinion that it had been waiting a long time, that it was impossible to doubt the fact, especially when stated on such unimpeachable authority. If Uncle Sol had been going to be hanged by his own time, he never would have allowed that the chronometer was too fast, by the least fraction of a second.</p> 
<p>Florence at parting recapitulated to the old man all that she had said before, and bound him to the compact. Uncle Sol attended her lovingly to the legs of the wooden Midshipman, and there resigned her to Walter, who was ready to escort her and Susan Nipper to the coach.</p> 
<p>'Walter,' said Florence by the way, 'I have been afraid to ask before your Uncle. Do you think you will be absent very long?'</p> 
<p>'Indeed,' said Walter, 'I don't know. I fear so. Mr Dombey signified as much, I thought, when he appointed me.'</p> 
<p>'Is it a favour, Walter?' inquired Florence, after a moment's hesitation, and looking anxiously in his face.</p> 
<p>'The appointment?' returned Walter.</p> 
<p>'Yes.'</p> 
<p>Walter would have given anything to have answered in the affirmative, but his face answered before his lips could, and Florence was too attentive to it not to understand its reply.</p> 
<p>'I am afraid you have scarcely been a favourite with Papa,' she said, timidly.</p> 
<p>'There is no reason,' replied Walter, smiling, 'why I should be.'</p> 
<p>'No reason, Walter!'</p> 
<p>'There was no reason,' said Walter, understanding what she meant. 'There are many people employed in the House. Between Mr Dombey and a young man like me, there's a wide space of separation. If I do my duty, I do what I ought, and do no more than all the rest.'</p> 
<p>Had Florence any misgiving of which she was hardly conscious: any misgiving that had sprung into an indistinct and undefined existence since that recent night when she had gone down to her father's room: that Walter's accidental interest in her, and early knowledge of her, might have involved him in that powerful displeasure and dislike? Had Walter any such idea, or any sudden thought that it was in her mind at that moment? Neither of them hinted at it. Neither of them spoke at all, for some short time. Susan, walking on the other side of Walter, eyed them both sharply; and certainly Miss Nipper's thoughts travelled in that direction, and very confidently too.</p> 
<p>'You may come back very soon,' said Florence, 'perhaps, Walter.'</p> 
<p>'I may come back,' said Walter, 'an old man, and find you an old lady. But I hope for better things.'</p> 
<p>'Papa,' said Florence, after a moment, 'will - will recover from his grief, and - speak more freely to me one day, perhaps; and if he should, I will tell him how much I wish to see you back again, and ask him to recall you for my sake.'</p> 
<p>There was a touching modulation in these words about her father, that Walter understood too well.</p> 
<p>The coach being close at hand, he would have left her without speaking, for now he felt what parting was; but Florence held his hand when she was seated, and then he found there was a little packet in her own.</p> 
<p>'Walter,' she said, looking full upon him with her affectionate eyes, 'like you, I hope for better things. I will pray for them, and believe that they will arrive. I made this little gift for Paul. Pray take it with my love, and do not look at it until you are gone away. And now, God bless you, Walter! never forget me. You are my brother, dear!'</p> 
<p>He was glad that Susan Nipper came between them, or he might have left her with a sorrowful remembrance of him. He was glad too that she did not look out of the coach again, but waved the little hand to him instead, as long as he could see it.</p> 
<p>In spite of her request, he could not help opening the packet that night when he went to bed. It was a little purse: and there was was money in it.</p> 
<p>Bright rose the sun next morning, from his absence in strange countries and up rose Walter with it to receive the Captain, who was already at the door: having turned out earlier than was necessary, in order to get under weigh while Mrs MacStinger was still slumbering. The Captain pretended to be in tip-top spirits, and brought a very smoky tongue in one of the pockets of the of the broad blue coat for breakfast.</p> 
<p>'And, Wal'r,' said the Captain, when they took their seats at table, if your Uncle's the man I think him, he'll bring out the last bottle of the Madeira on the present occasion.'</p> 
<p>'No, no, Ned,' returned the old man. 'No! That shall be opened when Walter comes home again.'</p> 
<p>'Well said!' cried the Captain. 'Hear him!'</p> 
<p>'There it lies,' said Sol Gills, 'down in the little cellar, covered with dirt and cobwebs. There may be dirt and cobwebs over you and me perhaps, Ned, before it sees the light.'</p> 
<p>'Hear him! 'cried the Captain. 'Good morality! Wal'r, my lad. Train up a fig-tree in the way it should go, and when you are old sit under the shade on it. Overhaul the - Well,' said the Captain on second thoughts, 'I ain't quite certain where that's to be found, but when found, make a note of. Sol Gills, heave ahead again!'</p> 
<p>'But there or somewhere, it shall lie, Ned, until Wally comes back to claim it,' said the old man. 'That's all I meant to say.'</p> 
<p>'And well said too,' returned the Captain; 'and if we three don't crack that bottle in company, I'll give you two leave to.'</p> 
<p>Notwithstanding the Captain's excessive joviality, he made but a poor hand at the smoky tongue, though he tried very hard, when anybody looked at him, to appear as if he were eating with a vast apetite. He was terribly afraid, likewise, of being left alone with either Uncle or nephew; appearing to consider that his only chance of safety as to keeping up appearances, was in there being always three together. This terror on the part of the Captain, reduced him to such ingenious evasions as running to the door, when Solomon went to put his coat on, under pretence of having seen an extraordinary hackney-coach pass: and darting out into the road when Walter went upstairs to take leave of the lodgers, on a feint of smelling fire in a neighbouring chimney. These artifices Captain Cuttle deemed inscrutable by any uninspired observer.</p> 
<p>Walter was coming down from his parting expedition upstairs, and was crossing the shop to go back to the little parlour, when he saw a faded face he knew, looking in at the door, and darted towards it.</p> 
<p>'Mr Carker!' cried Walter, pressing the hand of John Carker the Junior. 'Pray come in! This is kind of you, to be here so early to say good-bye to me. You knew how glad it would make me to shake hands with you, once, before going away. I cannot say how glad I am to have this opportunity. Pray come in.'</p> 
<p>'It is not likely that we may ever meet again, Walter,' returned the other, gently resisting his invitation, 'and I am glad of this opportunity too. I may venture to speak to you, and to take you by the hand, on the eve of separation. I shall not have to resist your frank approaches, Walter, any more.</p> 
<p>There was a melancholy in his smile as he said it, that showed he had found some company and friendship for his thoughts even in that.</p> 
<p>'Ah, Mr Carker!' returned Walter. 'Why did you resist them? You could have done me nothing but good, I am very sure.</p> 
<p>He shook his head. 'If there were any good,' he said, 'I could do on this earth, I would do it, Walter, for you. The sight of you from day to day, has been at once happiness and remorse to me. But the pleasure has outweighed the pain. I know that, now, by knowing what I lose.'</p> 
<p>'Come in, Mr Carker, and make acquaintance with my good old Uncle,' urged Walter. 'I have often talked to him about you, and he will be glad to tell you all he hears from me. I have not,' said Walter, noticing his hesitation, and speaking with embarrassment himself: 'I have not told him anything about our last conversation, Mr Carker; not even him, believe me.</p> 
<p>The grey Junior pressed his hand, and tears rose in his eyes.</p> 
<p>'If I ever make acquaintance with him, Walter,' he returned, 'it will be that I may hear tidings of you. Rely on my not wronging your forbearance and consideration. It would be to wrong it, not to tell him all the truth, before I sought a word of confidence from him. But I have no friend or acquaintance except you: and even for your sake, am little likely to make any.'</p> 
<p>'I wish,' said Walter, 'you had suffered me to be your friend indeed. I always wished it, Mr Carker, as you know; but never half so much as now, when we are going to part'</p> 
<p>'It is enough replied the other, 'that you have been the friend of my own breast, and that when I have avoided you most, my heart inclined the most towards you, and was fullest of you. Walter, good-bye!'</p> 
<p>'Good-bye, Mr Carker. Heaven be with you, Sir!' cried Walter with emotion.</p> 
<p>'If,' said the other, retaining his hand while he spoke; 'if when you come back, you miss me from my old corner, and should hear from anyone where I am lying, come and look upon my grave. Think that I might have been as honest and as happy as you! And let me think, when I know time is coming on, that some one like my former self may stand there, for a moment, and remember me with pity and forgiveness! Walter, good-bye!'</p> 
<p>His figure crept like a shadow down the bright, sun-lighted street, so cheerful yet so solemn in the early summer morning; and slowly passed away.</p> 
<p>The relentless chronometer at last announced that Walter must turn his back upon the wooden Midshipman: and away they went, himself, his Uncle, and the Captain, in a hackney-coach to a wharf, where they were to take steam-boat for some Reach down the river, the name of which, as the Captain gave it out, was a hopeless mystery to the ears of landsmen. Arrived at this Reach (whither the ship had repaired by last night's tide), they were boarded by various excited watermen, and among others by a dirty Cyclops of the Captain's acquaintance, who, with his one eye, had made the Captain out some mile and a half off, and had been exchanging unintelligible roars with him ever since. Becoming the lawful prize of this personage, who was frightfully hoarse and constitutionally in want of shaving, they were all three put aboard the Son and Heir. And the Son and Heir was in a pretty state of confusion, with sails lying all bedraggled on the wet decks, loose ropes tripping people up, men in red shirts running barefoot to and fro, casks blockading every foot of space, and, in the thickest of the fray, a black cook in a black caboose up to his eyes in vegetables and blinded with smoke.</p> 
<p>The Captain immediately drew Walter into a corner, and with a great effort, that made his face very red, pulled up the silver watch, which was so big, and so tight in his pocket, that it came out like a bung.</p> 
<p>'Wal'r,' said the Captain, handing it over, and shaking him heartily by the hand, 'a parting gift, my lad. Put it back half an hour every morning, and about another quarter towards the arternoon, and it's a watch that'll do you credit.'</p> 
<p>'Captain Cuttle! I couldn't think of it!' cried Walter, detaining him, for he was running away. 'Pray take it back. I have one already.'</p> 
<p>'Then, Wal'r,' said the Captain, suddenly diving into one of his pockets and bringing up the two teaspoons and the sugar-tongs, with which he had armed himself to meet such an objection, 'take this here trifle of plate, instead.'</p> 
<p>'No, no, I couldn't indeed!' cried Walter, 'a thousand thanks! Don't throw them away, Captain Cuttle!' for the Captain was about to jerk them overboard. 'They'll be of much more use to you than me. Give me your stick. I have often thought I should like to have it. There! Good-bye, Captain Cuttle! Take care of my Uncle! Uncle Sol, God bless you!'</p> 
<p>They were over the side in the confusion, before Walter caught another glimpse of either; and when he ran up to the stern, and looked after them, he saw his Uncle hanging down his head in the boat, and Captain Cuttle rapping him on the back with the great silver watch (it must have been very painful), and gesticulating hopefully with the teaspoons and sugar-tongs. Catching sight of Walter, Captain Cuttle dropped the property into the bottom of the boat with perfect unconcern, being evidently oblivious of its existence, and pulling off the glazed hat hailed him lustily. The glazed hat made quite a show in the sun with its glistening, and the Captain continued to wave it until he could be seen no longer. Then the confusion on board, which had been rapidly increasing, reached its height; two or three other boats went away with a cheer; the sails shone bright and full above, as Walter watched them spread their surface to the favourable breeze; the water flew in sparkles from the prow; and off upon her voyage went the Son and Heir, as hopefully and trippingly as many another son and heir, gone down, had started on his way before her.</p> 
<p>Day after day, old Sol and Captain Cuttle kept her reckoning in the little hack parlour and worked out her course, with the chart spread before them on the round table. At night, when old Sol climbed upstairs, so lonely, to the attic where it sometimes blew great guns, he looked up at the stars and listened to the wind, and kept a longer watch than would have fallen to his lot on board the ship. The last bottle of the old Madeira, which had had its cruising days, and known its dangers of the deep, lay silently beneath its dust and cobwebs, in the meanwhile, undisturbed.</p> 
<p>仪器制造商门口的木制海军军官候补生就像铁石心肠的小海军军官候补生一样，对沃尔特的离别一直极为漠不关心，甚至当沃尔特有后客厅逗留的最后一天即将消逝时也依然一样。象限仪紧挨着他像肉瘤般的一只圆鼓鼓的黑眼睛，身形像往日一样呈现出一副朝气蓬勃、不屈不挠的姿态，海军军官候补生尽量炫耀着他的像小精灵般的短裤，并埋头于科学研究，对于世俗的忧虑没有丝毫同情。他是个受环境支配的人儿；气候干燥的日子，他满身尘土；薄雾弥漫的日子，他身上复盖着点点煤烟的碎屑；下雨的日子，他失去了光泽的制服顿时焕然一新，闪闪发亮；炎热的日子，他的皮肤被晒出泡来；但是他在其他方面却是个麻木不仁、冷酷无情、自高自大的海军军官候补生，专心致志于自己的发现，对周围尘世间发生的事情不闻不问，就像阿基米得①在叙拉古被围时一样。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>①阿基米得（Archimedes，约公元前287—212年）：古希腊数学家和物理学家，理论力学的创始人，生于西西里岛的叙拉古城（Syracuse，当时是希腊的殖民城市）。当叙拉古开始被罗马人围困时，他正专心研究数学，不知道外面发生的战争。</p> 
<p>至少，在目前家中发生大事的情况下，他就是这样的一位海军军官候补生。沃尔特进进出出时向他亲切地定神看了许多次；当沃尔特不在家时，可怜的老所尔就出来靠在门柱上，把他那疲倦的戴着假发的脑袋尽量挨近这位他的店铺与营业的天才守卫者的鞋扣；可是海军军官候补生对这些向他作出的亲热殷勤的表示完全无动于衷，就像那残忍凶猛的偶像一样，嘴巴咧得大大的，由鹦鹉羽毛做成的脸孔露出一副杀气腾腾的凶相，对于他那些尚未开化的崇拜者们的恳求根本漠不关心。</p> 
<p>沃尔特环视着他居住多年的卧室，向上望到女儿墙和烟囱；天已经黑了，这时他想到这个夜晚过去，他就要跟它也许永久分离，心情感到沉重不堪。他的一些书籍和图画已经搬走，卧室由于他的遗弃，冷淡地、责备地望着他，并早已对他未来的疏远投下了阴影。“再过几个小时之后，”沃尔特想，“这个房间就不再属于我了，就像我当小学生时在这里做过的梦一样不再属于我了一样。在我睡觉的时候，梦也许还会回来，我也许还会醒着回到这个地方，但这梦至少不会回到新的主人的脑子里去了；这房间今后也许会有二十个新主人，他们每个人也许都会改变它、冷落它或不正当地使用它。”</p> 
<p>可是，不能让舅舅独自待在后面的小客厅里。这时，他正一个人坐在那里呢，因为卡特尔船长虽然性格粗犷，但却很能体贴人，他这时故意违背自己的心愿，没有来到，为的是使他们舅甥两人在没有旁人在场的情况下一块儿聊聊。所以，沃尔特经过最后一天的奔忙以后一回到家里，就急忙下楼去陪伴他。</p> 
<p>“舅舅，”他把一只手搁在老人的肩膀上，快乐地说道，“我从巴巴多斯给你送些什么东西来呢？”</p> 
<p>“把希望送来，我亲爱的沃利。在我进坟墓以前我们还能再见面的希望。你给我尽量多送一些来吧。”</p> 
<p>“我会给你送来的，舅舅。这样的希望我多得很，不会舍不得送给你的！至于活的海龟，给卡特尔船长配制潘趣酒的柠檬，给你星期天吃的罐头食品以及其他这一类东西，等我发了财，我会整船整船给你送来的。”</p> 
<p>老所尔擦了擦眼镜，无力地微笑着。</p> 
<p>“这就对了，舅舅！”沃尔特愉快地喊道，又在他肩膀上拍了六下，“你鼓舞我！我鼓舞你！我们将像明天早上的云雀一样快乐，舅舅，我们将像它们一样飞得那么高！至于我的希望嘛，它现在正在望不到的高空中歌唱着呢。”</p> 
<p>“沃利，我亲爱的孩子，”老人回答道，“我将尽我最大的努力，我将尽我最大的努力。”</p> 
<p>“你说到你最大的努力，舅舅，”沃尔特高兴地笑着说，“那肯定是最好的努力。舅舅，你不会忘记你将送给我的东西吧？”</p> 
<p>“不会的，沃利，不会的，”老人回答道，“我听到有关董贝小姐的一切，我将会写信告诉你。可怜的小羊羔，她现在单独一个人了。不过，我怕我听到的不多，沃利。”</p> 
<p>“啊，舅舅，这我就要告诉你，”沃尔特迟疑了片刻，说道，“我刚刚到那里去啦。”</p> 
<p>“啊，是吗？”老人扬起眉毛，同时也举起眼镜，说道。</p> 
<p>“我不是去看她，”沃尔特说，“虽然我敢说，如果我要求的话，我就能见到她，因为董贝先生不在家。我是去跟苏珊说句告别的话。你知道，在当前的情况下，同时如果记得我上次见到董贝小姐的那一天的话，我是可以大胆那么做的。”</p> 
<p>“是的，我的孩子，是的，”他的舅舅从暂时的出神中惊醒过来，回答道。</p> 
<p>“这样，我就见到了她，”沃尔特继续说道，“我是说苏珊；我告诉她我明天就要走了。我还跟她说，舅舅，自从董贝小姐那天夜里到这里来以后，你一直很关心她，一直在祝她健康和幸福，而且总以能稍稍为她效劳而感到自豪和高兴。你知道，在当前的情况下，我是可以这样说的。你觉得是不是？”</p> 
<p>“是的，我的孩子，是的，”他的舅舅用刚才同样的声调回答道。</p> 
<p>“我还要再说一句，”沃尔特继续说，“如果她——我是说苏珊——由她本人，或通过理查兹大嫂或其他顺便路过这里的什么人，在什么时候，让你知道，董贝小姐健康和幸福的话，那么你将会十分感谢她的好意，并会写信告诉我，我也将会十分感谢她的好意的。好啦，全说完了。说实在的，舅舅，”沃尔特说，“昨天我因为想这件事情几乎一整夜没睡着觉；而我一出门又下不定决心，究竟去不去做这件事；可是我相信我内心的真实感情，如果我不把它表达出来的话，那么我以后一定会很痛苦的。”</p> 
<p>他的诚实的声音和神态表明他所说的话是完全真实的，而且是坦诚的。</p> 
<p>“因此，舅舅，如果你什么时候见到她，”沃尔特说，“我现在是说董贝小姐，——也许你会见到她的，谁知道呢！——就请你告诉她，我对她怀着多大的好感；当我在这里的时候，我一直多么想着她，在我离开前一天的夜里，舅舅，我是多么热泪盈眶地谈到她。请你告诉她，我说，我永远不会忘记她那温柔的举止，她那美丽的容貌或她那胜过一切的可爱的、善良的性情。因为这两只鞋我并不是从一个女人的脚上，也不是从一个姑娘的脚上，而只是从一个天真的小孩的脚上得到的，”沃尔特说，“舅舅，如果你不介意，就请你告诉她，我保存着这双鞋子——她会记得，那天夜里它们跌落了多少次——，并把它们当作纪念品随身带走了！”</p> 
<p>就在这个时候，它们被装在沃尔特的一只箱子里被搬到门口。一个搬运工人正在把他的行李搬到一辆货车上，以便运到码头，装上“儿子和继承人”号；当它们的主人还没有讲完话的时候，它们已在冷淡无情的海军军官候补生的眼前被推走了。</p> 
<p>但是那位以往的海员对运走的珍宝所表现出的冷淡无情的态度也许是情有可原的。因为，使他大吃一惊的是，就在这同一个时刻，就在他的视野圈内，就在他的眼皮底下，弗洛伦斯和苏珊·尼珀已完全进入了他高度警惕的监视范围之中。弗洛伦斯不无胆怯地望着他的脸，碰见了他那紧张惊骇的木头眼光！</p> 
<p>不仅如此，她们还走进店铺，到了客厅的门口，除了海军军官候补生外，没有任何人注意到她们。沃尔特这时背对着门，如果不是看见舅舅从椅子中跳起来、几乎跌到另一张椅子上的话，连他当时也根本不会知道她们像幽灵似地突然来临。</p> 
<p>“怎么了，舅舅！”沃尔特大声喊道，“出了什么事？”</p> 
<p>老所罗门回答道：“董贝小姐！”</p> 
<p>“可能吗？”沃尔特喊道，一边四下环视，现在轮到他跳起来了，“到这里来了？”</p> 
<p>对了，这不仅是可能的，而且是千真万确的事实。他的话音未落，弗洛伦斯已急忙从他的身边跑过去，把所尔舅舅的鼻烟色的翻领的两边分别握在两只手中，吻了吻他的脸颊，然后转过身来，以她那独有的十分纯朴、真诚、恳切的神情，把手伸向沃尔特，这种神情确是世界上其他人所没有的！</p> 
<p>“要离开这里了吗，沃尔特？”弗洛伦斯问道。</p> 
<p>“是的，董贝小姐，”他回答道，但不像他努力想要表示出的那么乐观开朗，“我将外出航行。”</p> 
<p>“您的舅舅，”弗洛伦斯又回过来望着所罗门，说道，“您出去他一定感到难过。唉，我看他是这样的！亲爱的沃尔特，我也感到很难过。”</p> 
<p>“天知道，”尼珀姑娘高声嚷道，“世界上有许多人，我们没有他们也行，如果要精明善算的人，派皮普钦太太去当监工，称黄金，准能买到便宜的黄金，如果需要对付黑奴的知识，布林伯他们这家人就是最合适的人选。”</p> 
<p>尼珀小姐一边说，一边解开帽带，接着向桌子上和其他家常茶具摆在一起的一只小黑茶壶里面发呆地看了一会儿，然后摇摇头，又摇摇洋铁皮的茶叶罐，没经人请就泡起茶来。</p> 
<p>在这期间，弗洛伦斯又转向了仪器制造商；他对她极为赞赏，又感到极为惊奇。“长得这么大了！”老所尔说，“长得这么漂亮！可是一点没有变！跟原先一模一样！”</p> 
<p>“真的吗？”弗洛伦斯说。</p> 
<p>“是——是的，”老所尔回答道，一边慢吞吞地搓着手，低声地思考着这个问题，这时那双向他望着的明亮的眼睛中的沉思的神情吸引了他的注意，“是的，过去那张更年轻的脸上也曾表露过这样的神情！”</p> 
<p>“您还记得我哪，”弗洛伦斯微笑着说道，“那时候我是个多么小的小人儿啊？”</p> 
<p>“我亲爱的小姐，”仪器制造商回答道，“我怎么能忘记您呢？从那时起，我多么经常地想到您，多么经常地听到您的消息！说真的，就在您进来的时候，沃利还正在跟我谈起您，给您留下口信，还——”</p> 
<p>“真的吗？”弗洛伦斯说道，“谢谢您，沃尔特！啊，谢谢您，沃尔特！我还怕您走了以后不会再想到我了呢。”接着她又无拘无束、充分信任地向沃尔特伸出小手；他把它在自己手中握了好几秒钟，舍不得放开。</p> 
<p>可是沃尔特并不像先前那样握它，这样的接触也没有唤醒过去童年时代的那些白日梦，甚至最近这些梦有时还会从他面前漂浮过去，并以它们那模糊不清、支离破碎的形状使他心烦意乱。她那天真纯洁、可亲可爱的神态，她在专注的眼光中深切表露出的以及在俊俏的脸上通过微笑（这微笑太悲哀了，它在她脸上投下了阴影，不能使它容光焕发）洋溢着的对他的完全信任与真诚关怀，所有这些都不是浪漫性质的。它们使他回想起了他曾看到她殷勤看护的那张夭逝的小床，回想起了那男孩对她所怀的热爱，靠着这些回忆的翅膀，她似乎已远远地超越了他的那些胡思乱想，飞升到那更为明净、更为宁静的高空之中了。</p> 
<p>“我——我想，我得管您叫沃尔特的舅舅，先生，”弗洛伦斯对老人说，“如果您允许的话。”</p> 
<p>“我亲爱的小姐，”老所尔喊道，“如果我允许的话！我的上帝！”</p> 
<p>“我们常常是以这个称呼来了解您和谈起您的，”弗洛伦斯向四周看了一眼，轻轻地叹气道，“可爱的老客厅！完全跟先前一模一样！我把它记得多么清楚啊！”</p> 
<p>老所尔先看看她，又看看他的外甥，然后搓搓手，又擦擦眼镜，低声说道，“唉，时间啊，时间啊，时间啊！”</p> 
<p>接着是短暂的沉默；在这段时间中苏珊·尼珀灵巧地从碗柜里取出了两只带碟子的茶杯，并以若有所思的神气等待着泡茶。</p> 
<p>“我想跟沃尔特的舅舅说点我很担心的事，”弗洛伦斯胆怯地把手放在老人搁在桌子上的手上，以便引起他的注意，说道，“他很快就要单独一个人了，如果他允许我——不是代替沃尔特，因为那是我做不到的，而是在沃尔特不在的时候成为他的真诚的朋友，并尽我的力量来帮助他，那我就会十分感谢他。您肯允许我吗？我可以吗，沃尔特舅舅？”</p> 
<p>仪器制造商默默无言地把她的手拉到他的嘴唇上。苏珊·尼珀两手交叉，背靠在她自行充任的主席的椅子上，这时咬着帽带的一端，仰望着天窗，轻轻地叹了口气。</p> 
<p>“如果我可能的话，那么请允许我来看您，”弗洛伦斯说，“那时请您告诉我您自己和沃尔特的一切事情；如果苏珊代替我来的话，那么就请您不要对她保守秘密，请您信任我们，信赖我们，依靠我们。请您设法让我们成为您的安慰，您愿意吗，沃尔特的舅舅？”</p> 
<p>那张望着他的可爱的脸孔，那双关切的恳求的眼睛，那个温柔的声音，以及她在他胳膊上轻轻的抚摸，本来就使她显得十分亲切可爱，再加上女孩子对他年龄所怀有的崇敬与尊重，这就使她更加得人欢心，当时她表露出一种优雅得体的疑惑不定的神情和由于谦虚羞怯而犹豫不决的神情——所有这一切，以及她那出乎天性的恳切的态度，完全征服了这位可怜的年老的仪器制造商，他只是回答道：</p> 
<p>“沃利，为我说一句话吧，我亲爱的，我太感激了。”</p> 
<p>“不，沃尔特，”弗洛伦斯平静地微笑着回答道，“请您一句话也不要为他说。我很了解他，我们必须学会在您不在场的时候相互交谈，亲爱的沃尔特。”</p> 
<p>她说最后几个字时惋惜的声调比其他的一切更使他感动。</p> 
<p>“弗洛伦斯小姐，”他努力恢复刚才跟舅舅谈话时所保持的高兴的神态，回答道，“说真的，我跟舅舅一样，不知道说些什么话来感谢您的深情厚意。可是即使我能说上一个小时，我除了说这再一次表明了您的为人之外，我究竟还能说些别的什么呢？”</p> 
<p>苏珊·尼珀开始咬她帽带另外的一端，并向天窗点点头，表示赞成沃尔特表达出来的感情。</p> 
<p>“啊，沃尔特，”弗洛伦斯说道，“可是在您走之前，我还想跟您再说些话，请你一定管我叫弗洛伦斯，而不要像一个陌生人那样跟我说话。”</p> 
<p>“像一个陌生人一样！”沃尔特答道，“不，我不能那样说的。我相信，至少我没有这样的感觉。”</p> 
<p>“是的，但是那样还不够，我也不是这个意思。因为，沃尔特，”弗洛伦斯眼泪满满地涌流出来，继续说道，“他很喜欢您，临死的时候还说他爱您，又说，‘别忘记沃尔特！’现在他已死了，我在世界上没有兄弟了，如果您做我的哥哥，沃尔特，我将一辈子做您的妹妹，不论我们将来在什么地方，我都会像想到哥哥那样想到您！这就是我想要说的，亲爱的沃尔特，可是我却不能说得像我想说的那样好，因为千言万语充满了我的心怀，我不知该说什么好。”</p> 
<p>她怀着那颗充满了感情、纯朴可爱的心，把双手向他伸过去。沃尔特握着它们，弯下身子，嘴唇接触到她的流满了眼泪的脸；当他这样做的时候，她的脸没有退缩，没有转开，也没有发红，而是信赖地、真诚地仰望着他。在那瞬刻之间，任何怀疑或焦虑的阴影都从沃尔特的心灵中消失了；他似乎觉得，他是在那死去的孩子的床边回答她的天真的请求，并且在那个他曾亲眼看到的庄严的场合中发誓说，在他放逐在外的时候，他将以他兄弟般的关怀，珍爱和保护她的形象；他将保持她纯朴的信任，不让遭到破坏；如果他怀有任何当她对他表示信任时心中不曾怀有的思想，因而辜负了这样的信任时，他就认为自己卑鄙可耻。</p> 
<p>苏珊·尼珀在这过程中已经同时咬住帽带的两端，并向天窗传送了她本人的许多感情，这时她改变话题，问大家谁要牛奶，谁要糖；这些问题得到回答以后，她就开始倒茶。他们四人和睦友爱地围坐在小桌子的旁边，在那位姑娘殷勤的指挥下开始喝茶；弗洛伦斯光临后客厅，使墙上带帆的鞑靼战舰发出了光辉。</p> 
<p>半个小时以前，沃尔特无论如何也不敢放肆地用她的名字喊她。可是现在只要她请求，他就可以这样喊她。当他想到她来到这里的时候，不仅又在暗暗地担心：如果她不来反而更好。他可以平静地想到她长得多么美，想到多么大有希望，想到有朝一日某一位幸福的男子在她这样一颗心中将会得到多少缱绻柔情。他可以自豪地想到他在这颗心中也占有一席之地；并毅然下定决心，如果他现在还不配得到它的话——他仍然认为它高不可攀——他决不能在将来比现在更不配得到它。</p> 
<p>一定有什么神力支配着苏珊·尼珀倒茶的手，并产生了笼罩着后客厅中喝茶谈话时的平静的气氛。一定又有什么敌对的魔力支配着精密计时表的指针，使它们走得比永远在顺风中航行的鞑靼战舰还快。不管怎么样，客人们是有一辆轿式马车在一个不远的安静的角落里等待着的；当他们偶尔看到精密计时表时，它确凿地指明，马车已经等待得很长久了；这个事实是不容怀疑的，当它由这样一个无可指责的权威说明时尤其如此。如果所尔舅舅要按照他自己的时间处以绞刑的话，那么他也不会承认这精密计时表走快了一秒钟的万分之一。</p> 
<p>弗洛伦斯在离别时又把所有她刚才说过的话向老人扼要地重说了一遍，并要他保证遵守他们所达成的协议。所尔舅舅亲切地陪她走到木制海军军官候补生的腿边，在那里把她交给沃尔特；沃尔特欣然地护送着她与苏珊，向马车走去。</p> 
<p>“沃尔特，”弗洛伦斯在路上说道，“我刚才当着你舅舅的面不敢问您。您认为您将离开很久吗？”</p> 
<p>“说实在的，”沃尔特说，“我也不知道。我怕会这样。董贝先生指派我的时候，我觉得他表示了这样的意思。”</p> 
<p>“这是不是对您的一种恩惠，沃尔特？”弗洛伦斯迟疑了片刻后问道，同时忧虑地望着他的脸。</p> 
<p>“您是指这次指派吗？”沃尔特反问道。</p> 
<p>“是的。”</p> 
<p>沃尔特非常想给予肯定的回答，但是他的脸色比他的嘴回答得早，弗洛伦斯又是那么注意地观察着，所以她不可能不理解它的回答。</p> 
<p>“我怕您不是我爸爸所宠爱的人，”她胆怯地说道。</p> 
<p>“没有什么理由我必须是，”沃尔特微笑着回答道。</p> 
<p>“没有理由吗，沃尔特？”</p> 
<p>“过去没有什么理由，”沃尔特明白她的意思，说道，“公司里雇用着许多人。在董贝先生和像我这样的一个年轻人之间，有着一个很宽阔的距离。如果我尽我的职责，我就做我应当做的事，而不做任何其他有情。”</p> 
<p>在弗洛伦斯心上是不是有着她还不怎么意识到的忧虑，是不是自从最近那天夜间她走到楼下她父亲房间去以后她心中产生出一种模糊不清和不可名状的忧虑：沃尔特由于偶然的原因对她产生兴趣以及过早地认识她，这会引起她父亲对他强烈的不快和讨厌？在沃尔特心中是不是也有这样的想法，或者突然想到在这个时刻她的心中也正在这么想？在短短的一段时间中，他们两人谁也没有说话。走在沃尔特另一边的苏珊敏锐地注视着他们两人；尼珀姑娘的思想肯定也朝着那个方向转悠，并且十分相信自己的看法是正确的。</p> 
<p>“您可能很快就会回来的，”弗洛伦斯说道，“也许会这样的，沃尔特。”</p> 
<p>“我可能回来时已成了个老头子了，”沃尔特说道，“并且看到您已成了个老太太了。不过我往好里希望。”</p> 
<p>“爸爸，”弗洛伦斯沉默了片刻之后说，“也许会——会从悲痛中恢复过来，有一天会——更无拘无束地跟我说话；如果那样的话，那么我将告诉他，我是多么希望看到您重新回来，并请求他为了我的缘故把您调回来。”</p> 
<p>她谈到她父亲的这些话声调压抑，缺乏信心，令人感动，沃尔特听得很明白。</p> 
<p>马车就在近旁，他本来会默默无言地跟她分手的，因为他这时真正感觉到离别的滋味了；可是弗洛伦斯坐下以后握住他的手，这时他觉得她手中有一个小包包。</p> 
<p>“沃尔特，”她用感情深厚的眼光望着他的脸，说道，“我像您一样，也希望有美好的将来。我将祈求它，相信它会来临。我为保罗准备了这个小小的礼物，请随同我的爱把它拿走吧，在您离别之前别去看它。愿上帝保佑您，沃尔特！千万别忘记我。您是我的哥哥呀，亲爱的！”</p> 
<p>他感到高兴的是，苏珊·尼珀这时走到他们中间，要不然他就会给她留下一个关于他的悲伤的回忆了。他又感到高兴的是，她没有再从马车里往外望，而是向他挥着小手，一直到他望不见为止。</p> 
<p>他在当天夜里睡觉之前，不顾她的请求，还是忍不住把那小包包打开了。这是个小小的钱包，里面装着钱。</p> 
<p>第二天早晨，太阳从异国他乡返回，光辉灿烂地升起，沃尔特也随同它一道起来，去迎接早已在门口的船长。船长本不需要这么早就起床，但他是为了在麦克斯廷杰太太还在睡觉的时候就上路才这么做的；他假装情绪高昂，在他宽大的蓝色外衣的一个口袋中带来一条熏得很黑的舌头作为早餐。</p> 
<p>“沃尔，”当他们在桌旁坐下的时候，船长说道，“如果你舅舅是我所想的那种人，遇上今天这样的日子，他是会取出他最后的那瓶马德拉白葡萄酒的。”</p> 
<p>“不，不，内德，”老人回答道，“不，那瓶酒等沃尔特重新回到家里时再打开。”</p> 
<p>“说得好！”船长喊道，“听他说吧！”</p> 
<p>“它躺在那里，”所尔·吉尔斯说，“躺在下面的小地窖里，上面覆盖着尘土和蜘蛛网。在它重见阳光之前，内德，也许你和我身上也已覆盖着尘土和蜘蛛网了。”</p> 
<p>“听他说吧！”船长喊道，“极妙的寓意！沃尔，我的孩子，栽一株无花果，让它好好长大，等你老了，就坐在树荫下休息。翻一下——不过，”船长想了一下，说，“我不能很肯定从哪本书里可以找到这句话；可是你要是收到的话，请把它记下来。所尔·吉尔斯。重新往前用力拉吧①！”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>①这是水手在起锚时的劳动号子，船长借用它来要所尔·吉尔斯继续往下说。</p> 
<p>“可是它得躺在那里或别的什么地方，内德，直到沃利回来要求喝它的时候，”老人说道，“这就是我所想要说的一切。”</p> 
<p>“说得也不错，”船长回答道，“如果我们三人不能一起打开那瓶酒的话，那么我允许你们两人把我的那份也喝掉！”</p> 
<p>船长虽然谈笑风生，十分兴高采烈，但他对付那条熏黑的舌头的本领却怪差劲，尽管当有人看着他的时候，他极力装出胃口很好地吃着。而且，他很害怕和舅舅或外甥单独在一起，好像他认为，他要保持这种春风满面的神态，唯一安全的机会是三个人老待在一起。船长由于怀有这种恐惧心理，他就想出了好些机智的逃避方法：当所罗门走去穿外衣的时候，他就假装看到一辆不同寻常的出租马车经过而跑到门口；当沃尔特上楼去跟房客们告别时，他就假装闻到邻近烟囱的火焦味而冲到街上。船长认为，没有灵感的观察者是很难看破他的这些巧计的。</p> 
<p>沃尔特去楼上告别之后走下楼来，正穿过店铺向小客厅走回的时候，他看到一张他认识的憔悴的脸正向门里探望，就立即向他急冲过去。</p> 
<p>“卡克先生！”沃尔特紧握着约翰·卡克先生的手，喊道，“请进来吧！您真客气，起得这么早来向我告别。您知道，我多么高兴能在离别之前再跟您握一次手啊。我说不出我是多么高兴能有这个机会。请进来吧！”</p> 
<p>“我们不见得以后还能再见面了，沃尔特，”那一位委婉地谢绝了他的邀请，“我也因为有这个机会而感到高兴。在即将离别之前，我也许可以不揣冒昧地来跟您说说话和握握手。</p> 
<p>沃尔特，我将不再迫不得已反对您坦率地跟我接近了”。</p> 
<p>当他说这些话的时候，在他的微笑中还带有一些忧郁的东西，这表明他甚至在沃尔特要跟他接近的想法本身中也看到了关怀与友谊。</p> 
<p>“唉，卡克先生！”沃尔特回答道，“您为什么要反对呢？</p> 
<p>我完全相信，您只会做对我有益的事情。”</p> 
<p>他摇摇头。“如果在这世界上我能做点儿什么有益事情的话，那么我将会为您做的。我一天天看到您，对我来说，既感到快乐，又引起悔恨。但是高兴超过了痛苦。现在我明白了这一点，因为我知道我失去什么了。”</p> 
<p>“请进来吧，卡克先生，来跟我善良的年老的舅舅认识认识吧，”沃尔特催促着，“我常常跟他说到您，他将会高兴把从我那里听到的一切告诉您；我没有，”沃尔特注意到他的迟疑，他自己也感到局促不安地说道，“我没有跟他说起我们上次谈话的内容，什么也没有说；卡克先生；甚至对他我也不说，请相信我。”</p> 
<p>这位头发斑白的低级职员紧握着他的手，眼睛里涌出了泪水。</p> 
<p>“如果我什么时候跟他认识，沃尔特，”他回答道，“那么那只是为了可以从他那里打听到您的消息。请相信我决不会对不起您对我的宽容与关心。如果我在取得他的信任之前不把全部真情告诉他，那么我就对不起您的宽容与关心了。但是我除了您，没有别的朋友或熟人；甚至为了您的缘故我也未必会去找。”</p> 
<p>“我希望，”沃尔特说，“您已真正允许我做您的朋友。卡克先生；您知道，我经常是这样希望的；可是这希望从不曾像现在我们就要分别的时候这么强烈。”</p> 
<p>“您一直是我心里的朋友，当我愈是避开您的时候，我的心就愈是向着您，愈是一心一意地想着您——我想这就够了。</p> 
<p>沃尔特，再见吧！”</p> 
<p>“再见吧，卡克先生，愿老天爷保佑您，先生！”沃尔特激动地喊道。</p> 
<p>“如果，”那一位继续握着他的手说道，“如果您回来时，在我原先的角落里看不到我，并从别人那里打听到我躺在什么地方的话，那么请来看看我的坟墓吧。请想一想，我本来是可以跟您一样诚实和幸福的！当我知道我的死期就要来临的时候，请让我想到，有一位像我过去一样的人会在那里站上片刻，怀着怜悯与宽恕的心情记得我的！沃尔特，再见吧！”</p> 
<p>夏日清晨的街道布满了阳光，明明亮亮，那么令人爽心悦目，又那么庄严肃穆；他的身形像一个影子似的，沿着这条街道缓慢地移行着，最后消失不见了。</p> 
<p>毫不留情的精密计时表终于宣告：沃尔特必须离别木制海军军官候补生了。他们——他自己、舅舅和船长——乘着一辆出租马车动身前往码头，再从码头搭乘汽艇到河流下面的一个河段；当船长说出它的名称时，陆地上的人们听起来真像是个不可思议、神奇莫测的秘密。当汽艇乘着昨夜的涨潮，开到这个河段之后，他们被一群情绪兴奋的划小船的船家团团围住，里面有一位是船长认识的肮脏的赛克洛普斯①；他虽然只有一只眼睛，但在一英里半之外就认出了船长，从那时起就跟他交换着难以理解的么喝。这位胡子拉碴、嗓子嘶哑得可怕的人，把他们三人当成了合法的战利品，运送到“儿子和继承人”号上。“儿子和继承人”号上十分混乱，沾着泥水的船帆被撂在湿漉漉的甲板上，没有拉紧的绳索把人们绊倒，穿着红衬衫的船员们赤着脚跑来跑去，木桶堵塞着每一小块空处；在这一切杂乱的中心，甲板上黑厨房中的一位黑厨师周围堆满了蔬菜，一直堆到他的眼睛底下，他的眼睛被烟薰得几乎失明。</p>

<p>船长立即把沃尔特拉到一个角落里，脸孔涨得通红，使劲地拉出了那只银表；那只表很大，在他的衣袋中塞得又很紧，所以把它拉出的时候就像从桶口拔出个大塞子似的。</p> 
<p>“沃尔，”船长把它递过去，并热烈地握着他的手说道，“这是告别的礼物，我的孩子。每天早上把它往后拨半小时，到中午再往后拨一刻钟左右。这只表是你可以引以自豪的。”</p> 
<p>“卡特尔船长！我不能要这个！”沃尔特喊道，一边拦住他，因为他正要跑开。“请拿回去。我已经有一只了。”</p> 
<p>“那么，沃尔，”船长突然把手伸进另一只口袋。取出两只茶匙和一副方糖箝子，他装备着这些东西就是为了防备遭到拒绝时用的。“就请改拿走这些喝茶用的小东西吧！”</p> 
<p>“不，不，说真的，我不能拿走！”沃尔特喊道，“千谢万谢！别扔掉，卡特尔船长！”因为船长正想要把它们投掷到船外。“它们对您比对我有用得多。把您的手杖给我吧。我时常想，我要能有它该多好啊。唔，这就是！再见，卡特尔船长！</p> 
<p>请照顾照顾舅舅吧！所尔舅舅，上帝保佑你！”</p> 
<p>沃尔特没来得及再望他们一眼，他们已经在混乱之中离开大船了；当他跑到船尾，目送着他们的时候，他看见舅舅坐在小船里低垂着头，卡特尔船长用那只大银表拍打着他的背（那一定很痛），还精神抖擞地用茶匙和方糖箝子打着手势。卡特尔船长瞧见沃尔特时，显然忘记了他还有这些财产，漫不经心地把它们掉落到小船船底，同时脱下了上了光的帽子，拼命地向他欢呼。上了光的帽子在阳光下闪闪发光，大出风头，船长不断地挥舞着它，直到望不见沃尔特为止。船上一直在迅速增加的杂乱这时达到了高潮；另外两三只小船在欢呼声中离开；当沃尔特望着船帆在顺风中舒展开帆面的时候，船帆在上空明亮和丰满地闪耀着；浪花从船头飞溅过来；“儿子和继承人”号就这样雄赳赳气昂昂地、轻轻快快地启程航行，就像在它之前已经走上旅程的其他许多儿子和继承人一样，一直向前行进。</p> 
<p>老所尔和卡特尔船长在小后客厅里一天天在圆桌上摊开地图，推算着船舶的航行距离，研究着它的航线。夜里，当老所尔十分孤独地走上楼去，一直走到有时大风猛刮的顶楼上时，他仰望着星星，静听着风声；如果让他在那艘船上值夜，也不会像他现在值得这么长久。那最后一瓶马德拉白葡萄酒曾经度过漂洋过海的日子，体验过海洋深处的危险，这时却安安静静地躺在尘土和蜘蛛网下面，谁也不去打搅它。</p>
