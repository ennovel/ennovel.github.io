McMurdo, who had already been appointed Inner Deacon, with every prospect of some day succeeding McGinty as Bodymaster, was now so necessary to the councils of his comrades that nothing was done without his help and advice. The more popular he became, however, with the Freemen, the blacker were the scowls which greeted him as he passed along the streets of Vermissa. In spite of their terror the citizens were taking heart to band themselves together against their oppressors. Rumours had reached the lodge of secret gatherings in the Herald office and of distribution of firearms among the law-abiding people. But McGinty and his men were undisturbed by such reports. They were numerous, resolute, and well armed. Their opponents were scattered and powerless. It would all end, as it had done in the past, in aimless talk and possibly in impotent arrests. So said McGinty, McMurdo, and all the bolder spirits.</p> 
<p>It was a Saturday evening in May. Saturday was always the lodge night, and McMurdo was leaving his house to attend it when Morris, the weaker brother of the order, came to see him. His brow was creased with care, and his kindly face was drawn and haggard.</p> 
<p>"Can I speak with you freely, Mr. McMurdo?"</p> 
<p>"Sure."</p> 
<p>"I can't forget that I spoke my heart to you once, and that you kept it to yourself, even though the Boss himself came to ask you about it."</p> 
<p>"What else could I do if you trusted me? It wasn't that I agreed with what you said."</p> 
<p>"I know that well. But you are the one that I can speak to and be safe. I've a secret here," he put his hand to his breast, "and it is just burning the life out of me. I wish it had come to any one of you but me. If I tell it, it will mean murder, for sure. If I don't, it may bring the end of us all. God help me, but I am near out of my wits over it!"</p> 
<p>McMurdo looked at the man earnestly. He was trembling in every limb. He poured some whisky into a glass and handed it to him. "That's the physic for the likes of you," said he. "Now let me hear of it."</p> 
<p>Morris drank, and his white face took a tinge of colour. "I can tell it to you all in one sentence," said he. "There's a detective on our trail."</p> 
<p>McMurdo stared at him in astonishment. "Why, man, you're crazy," he said. "Isn't the place full of police and detectives and what harm did they ever do us?"</p> 
<p>"No, no, it's no man of the district. As you say, we know them, and it is little that they can do. But you've heard of Pinkerton's?"</p> 
<p>"I've read of some folk of that name."</p> 
<p>"Well, you can take it from me you've no show when they are on your trail. It's not a take-it-or-miss-it government concern. It's a dead earnest business proposition that's out for results and keeps out till by hook or crook it gets them. If a Pinkerton man is deep in this business, we are all destroyed."</p> 
<p>"We must kill him."</p> 
<p>"Ah, it's the first thought that came to you! So it will be up at the lodge. Didn't I say to you that it would end in murder?"</p> 
<p>"Sure, what is murder? Isn't it common enough in these parts?"</p> 
<p>"It is, indeed; but it's not for me to point out the man that is to be murdered. I'd never rest easy again. And yet it's our own necks that may be at stake. In God's name what shall I do?" He rocked to and fro in his agony of indecision.</p> 
<p>But his words had moved McMurdo deeply. It was easy to see that he shared the other's opinion as to the danger, and the need for meeting it. He gripped Morris's shoulder and shook him in his earnestness.</p> 
<p>"See here, man," he cried, and he almost screeched the words in his excitement, "you won't gain anything by sitting keening like an old wife at a wake. Let's have the facts. Who is the fellow? Where is he? How did you hear of him? Why did you come to me?"</p> 
<p>"I came to you; for you are the one man that would advise me. I told you that I had a store in the East before I came here. I left good friends behind me, and one of them is in the telegraph service. Here's a letter that I had from him yesterday. It's this part from the top of the page. You can read it yourself."</p> 
<p>This was what McMurdo read:</p> 
<p>How are the Scowrers getting on in your parts? We read plenty of them in the papers. Between you and me I expect to hear news from you before long. Five big corporations and the two railroads have taken the thing up in dead earnest. They mean it, and you can bet they'll get there! They are right deep down into it. Pinkerton has taken hold under their orders, and his best man, Birdy Edwards, is operating. The thing has got to be stopped right now.</p> 
<p>"Now read the postscript."</p> 
<p>Of course, what I give you is what I learned in business; so it goes no further. It's a queer cipher that you handle by the yard every day and can get no meaning from.</p> 
<p>McMurdo sat in silence for some time, with the letter in his listless hands. The mist had lifted for a moment, and there was the abyss before him.</p> 
<p>"Does anyone else know of this?" he asked.</p> 
<p>"I have told no one else."</p> 
<p>"But this man--your friend--has he any other person that he would be likely to write to?"</p> 
<p>"Well, I dare say he knows one or two more."</p> 
<p>"Of the lodge?"</p> 
<p>"It's likely enough."</p> 
<p>"I was asking because it is likely that he may have given some description of this fellow Birdy Edwards--then we could get on his trail."</p> 
<p>"Well, it's possible. But I should not think he knew him. He is just telling me the news that came to him by way of business. How would he know this Pinkerton man?"</p> 
<p>McMurdo gave a violent start.</p> 
<p>"By Gar!" he cried, "I've got him. What a fool I was not to know it. Lord! but we're in luck! We will fix him before he can do any harm. See here, Morris, will you leave this thing in my hands?"</p> 
<p>"Sure, if you will only take it off mine."</p> 
<p>"I'll do that. You can stand right back and let me run it. Even your name need not be mentioned. I'll take it all on myself, as if it were to me that this letter has come. Will that content you?"</p> 
<p>"It's just what I would ask."</p> 
<p>"Then leave it at that and keep your head shut. Now I'll get down to the lodge, and we'll soon make old man Pinkerton sorry for himself."</p> 
<p>"You wouldn't kill this man?"</p> 
<p>"The less you know, Friend Morris, the easier your conscience will be, and the better you will sleep. Ask no questions, and let these things settle themselves. I have hold of it now."</p> 
<p>Morris shook his head sadly as he left. "I feel that his blood is on my hands," he groaned.</p> 
<p>"Self-protection is no murder, anyhow," said McMurdo, smiling grimly. "It's him or us. I guess this man would destroy us all if we left him long in the valley. Why, Brother Morris, we'll have to elect you Bodymaster yet; for you've surely saved the lodge."</p> 
<p>And yet it was clear from his actions that he thought more seriously of this new intrusion than his words would show. It may have been his guilty conscience, it may have been the reputation of the Pinkerton organization, it may have been the knowledge that great, rich corporations had set themselves the task of clearing out the Scowrers; but, whatever his reason, his actions were those of a man who is preparing for the worst. Every paper which would incriminate him was destroyed before he left the house. After that he gave a long sigh of satisfaction; for it seemed to him that he was safe. And yet the danger must still have pressed somewhat upon him; for on his way to the lodge he stopped at old man Shafter's. The house was forbidden him; but when he tapped at the window Ettie came out to him. The dancing Irish deviltry had gone from her lover's eyes. She read his danger in his earnest face.</p> 
<p>"Something has happened!" she cried. "Oh, Jack, you are in danger!"</p> 
<p>"Sure, it is not very bad, my sweetheart. And yet it may be wise that we make a move before it is worse."</p> 
<p>"Make a move?"</p> 
<p>"I promised you once that I would go some day. I think the time is coming. I had news to-night, bad news, and I see trouble coming."</p> 
<p>"The police?"</p> 
<p>"Well, a Pinkerton. But, sure, you wouldn't know what that is, acushla, nor what it may mean to the likes of me. I'm too deep in this thing, and I may have to get out of it quick. You said you would come with me if I went."</p> 
<p>"Oh, Jack, it would be the saving of you!"</p> 
<p>"I'm an honest man in some things, Ettie. I wouldn't hurt a hair of your bonny head for all that the world can give, nor ever pull you down one inch from the golden throne above the clouds where I always see you. Would you trust me?"</p> 
<p>She put her hand in his without a word. "Well, then, listen to what I say, and do as I order you, for indeed it's the only way for us. Things are going to happen in this valley. I feel it in my bones. There may be many of us that will have to look out for ourselves. I'm one, anyhow. If I go, by day or night, it's you that must come with me!"</p> 
<p>"I'd come after you, Jack."</p> 
<p>"No, no, you shall come WITH me. If this valley is closed to me and I can never come back, how can I leave you behind, and me perhaps in hiding from the police with never a chance of a message? It's with me you must come. I know a good woman in the place I come from, and it's there I'd leave you till we can get married. Will you come?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, Jack, I will come."</p> 
<p>"God bless you for your trust in me! It's a fiend out of hell that I should be if I abused it. Now, mark you, Ettie, it will be just a word to you, and when it reaches you, you will drop everything and come right down to the waiting room at the depot and stay there till I come for you."</p> 
<p>"Day or night, I'll come at the word, Jack."</p> 
<p>Somewhat eased in mind, now that his own preparations for escape had been begun, McMurdo went on to the lodge. It had already assembled, and only by complicated signs and countersigns could he pass through the outer guard and inner guard who close-tiled it. A buzz of pleasure and welcome greeted him as he entered. The long room was crowded, and through the haze of tobacco smoke he saw the tangled black mane of the Bodymaster, the cruel, unfriendly features of Baldwin, the vulture face of Harraway, the secretary, and a dozen more who were among the leaders of the lodge. He rejoiced that they should all be there to take counsel over his news.</p> 
<p>"Indeed, it's glad we are to see you, Brother!" cried the chairman. "There's business here that wants a Solomon in judgment to set it right."</p> 
<p>"It's Lander and Egan," explained his neighbour as he took his seat. "They both claim the head money given by the lodge for the shooting of old man Crabbe over at Stylestown, and who's to say which fired the bullet?"</p> 
<p>McMurdo rose in his place and raised his hand. The expression of his face froze the attention of the audience. There was a dead hush of expectation.</p> 
<p>"Eminent Bodymaster," he said, in a solemn voice, "I claim urgency!"</p> 
<p>"Brother McMurdo claims urgency," said McGinty. "It's a claim that by the rules of this lodge takes precedence. Now Brother, we attend you."</p> 
<p>McMurdo took the letter from his pocket.</p> 
<p>"Eminent Bodymaster and Brethren," he said, "I am the bearer of ill news this day; but it is better that it should be known and discussed, than that a blow should fall upon us without warning which would destroy us all. I have information that the most powerful and richest organizations in this state have bound themselves together for our destruction, and that at this very moment there is a Pinkerton detective, one Birdy Edwards, at work in the valley collecting the evidence which may put a rope round the necks of many of us, and send every man in this room into a felon's cell. That is the situation for the discussion of which I have made a claim of urgency."</p> 
<p>There was a dead silence in the room. It was broken by the chairman.</p> 
<p>"What is your evidence for this, Brother McMurdo?" he asked.</p> 
<p>"It is in this letter which has come into my hands," said McMurdo. Me read the passage aloud. "It is a matter of honour with me that I can give no further particulars about the letter, nor put it into your hands; but I assure you that there is nothing else in it which can affect the interests of the lodge. I put the case before you as it has reached me."</p> 
<p>"Let me say, Mr. Chairman," said one of the older brethren, "that I have heard of Birdy Edwards, and that he has the name of being the best man in the Pinkerton service."</p> 
<p>"Does anyone know him by sight?" asked McGinty.</p> 
<p>"Yes," said McMurdo, "I do."</p> 
<p>There was a murmur of astonishment through the hall.</p> 
<p>"I believe we hold him in the hollow of our hands," he continued with an exulting smile upon his face. "If we act quickly and wisely, we can cut this thing short. If I have your confidence and your help, it is little that we have to fear."</p> 
<p>"What have we to fear, anyhow? What can he know of our affairs?"</p> 
<p>"You might say so if all were as stanch as you, Councillor. But this man has all the millions of the capitalists at his back. Do you think there is no weaker brother among all our lodges that could not be bought? He will get at our secrets--maybe has got them already. There's only one sure cure."</p> 
<p>"That he never leaves the valley," said Baldwin.</p> 
<p>McMurdo nodded. "Good for you, Brother Baldwin," he said. "You and I have had our differences, but you have said the true word to-night."</p> 
<p>"Where is he, then? Where shall we know him?"</p> 
<p>"Eminent Bodymaster," said McMurdo, earnestly, "I would put it to you that this is too vital a thing for us to discuss in open lodge. God forbid that I should throw a doubt on anyone here; but if so much as a word of gossip got to the ears of this man, there would be an end of any chance of our getting him. I would ask the lodge to choose a trusty committee, Mr. Chairman-- yourself, if I might suggest it, and Brother Baldwin here, and five more. Then I can talk freely of what I know and of what I advise should be done."</p> 
<p>The proposition was at once adopted, and the committee chosen. Besides the chairman and Baldwin there were the vulture-faced secretary, Harraway, Tiger Cormac, the brutal young assassin, Carter, the treasurer, and the brothers Willaby, fearless and desperate men who would stick at nothing.</p> 
<p>The usual revelry of the lodge was short and subdued: for there was a cloud upon the men's spirits, and many there for the first time began to see the cloud of avenging Law drifting up in that serene sky under which they had dwelt so long. The horrors they had dealt out to others had been so much a part of their settled lives that the thought of retribution had become a remote one, and so seemed the more startling now that it came so closely upon them. They broke up early and left their leaders to their council.</p> 
<p>"Now, McMurdo!" said McGinty when they were alone. The seven men sat frozen in their seats.</p> 
<p>"I said just now that I knew Birdy Edwards," McMurdo explained. "I need not tell you that he is not here under that name. He's a brave man, but not a crazy one. He passes under the name of Steve Wilson, and he is lodging at Hobson's Patch."</p> 
<p>"How do you know this?"</p> 
<p>"Because I fell into talk with him. I thought little of it at the time, nor would have given it a second thought but for this letter; but now I'm sure it's the man. I met him on the cars when I went down the line on Wednesday--a hard case if ever there was one. He said he was a reporter. I believed it for the moment. Wanted to know all he could about the Scowrers and what he called 'the outrages' for a New York paper. Asked me every kind of question so as to get something. You bet I was giving nothing away. 'I'd pay for it and pay well,' said he, 'if I could get some stuff that would suit my editor.' I said what I thought would please him best, and he handed me a twenty-dollar bill for my information. 'There's ten times that for you,' said he, 'if you can find me all that I want.'"</p> 
<p>"What did you tell him, then?"</p> 
<p>"Any stuff I could make up."</p> 
<p>"How do you know he wasn't a newspaper man?"</p> 
<p>"I'll tell you. He got out at Hobson's Patch, and so did I. I chanced into the telegraph bureau, and he was leaving it.</p> 
<p>"'See here,' said the operator after he'd gone out, 'I guess we should charge double rates for this.'--'I guess you should,' said I. He had filled the form with stuff that might have been Chinese, for all we could make of it. 'He fires a sheet of this off every day,' said the clerk. 'Yes,' said I; 'it's special news for his paper, and he's scared that the others should tap it.' That was what the operator thought and what I thought at the time; but I think differently now."</p> 
<p>"By Gar! I believe you are right," said McGinty. "But what do you allow that we should do about it?"</p> 
<p>"Why not go right down now and fix him?" someone suggested.</p> 
<p>"Ay, the sooner the better."</p> 
<p>"I'd start this next minute if I knew where we could find him," said McMurdo. "He's in Hobson's Patch; but I don't know the house. I've got a plan, though, if you'll only take my advice."</p> 
<p>"Well, what is it?"</p> 
<p>"I'll go to the Patch to-morrow morning. I'll find him through the operator. He can locate him, I guess. Well, then I'll tell him that I'm a Freeman myself. I'll offer him all the secrets of the lodge for a price. You bet he'll tumble to it. I'll tell him the papers are at my house, and that it's as much as my life would be worth to let him come while folk were about. He'll see that that's horse sense. Let him come at ten o'clock at night, and he shall see everything. That will fetch him sure."</p> 
<p>"Well?"</p> 
<p>"You can plan the rest for yourselves. Widow MacNamara's is a lonely house. She's as true as steel and as deaf as a post. There's only Scanlan and me in the house. If I get his promise--and I'll let you know if I do--I'd have the whole seven of you come to me by nine o'clock. We'll get him in. If ever he gets out alive--well, he can talk of Birdy Edwards's luck for the rest of his days!"</p> 
<p>"There's going to be a vacancy at Pinkerton's or I'm mistaken. Leave it at that, McMurdo. At nine to-morrow we'll be with you. You once get the door shut behind him, and you can leave the rest with us."</p> 
<p>恐怖统治达到了顶峰。麦克默多已经被委任为会中的执事，大有希望日后继麦金蒂做身主的候选人，现在他的同伙都要征求他的意见，以致没有他的指点和协助，什么事也做不成。可是，他在自由人会中的名声愈大，当他在维尔米萨街上走过时，那些平民愈仇视他。他们不顾恐怖的威胁，决心联合起来共同反抗压其他们的人。死酷党听到传说：先驱报社有秘密集会，并向守法的平民分发武器。但麦金蒂和他手下的人对此却毫不介意。因为他们人数众多，胆大包天，武器精良；而对手却是一盘散沙，无权无势。结果一定象过去一样，只是漫无目标的空谈，多半是无能为力的罢手而已。这就是麦金蒂、麦克默多和那些勇敢分子们的说法。</p> 
<p>党徒们经常在星期六晚上集会。五月里，一个星期六的晚上，麦克默多正要去赴会，被称为懦夫的莫里斯兄弟前来拜访他。莫里斯愁容满面，紧皱双眉，慈祥的面孔显得憔悴瘦长。</p> 
<p>“我可以和你随便谈谈吗？麦克默多先生。”</p> 
<p>“当然可以。”</p> 
<p>“我从未忘记，有一次我曾向你说过心里话，甚至首领亲自来问你这件事，你也守口如瓶。”</p> 
<p>“既然你信任我，我怎能不这样做呢？但这并不等于我同意你所说的话。”</p> 
<p>“这点我是知道的。不过我只有对你才敢说心里话，而又不怕泄露。现在我有一件秘密，"他把手放在胸前，说道，“它使我心急如焚。我愿它施加于你们任何一个人身上，只希望我能幸免。假如我把它说出来，势必要出谋杀案件。如果我不说，那就可能招致我们全体覆灭。愿上帝救我，我简直不知如何是好了！”</p> 
<p>麦克默多恳切地望着他，只见他四肢颤抖。麦克默多倒了一杯威士忌酒给他。</p> 
<p>“这就是对你这样的人用的药品，"麦克默多说道，“现在请你告诉我吧。”</p> 
<p>莫里斯把酒喝了，苍白的面容恢复了红润。"我可以只用一句话就向你说清楚。"他说道，“已经有侦探追查我们了。”</p> 
<p>麦克默多惊愕地望着他。</p> 
<p>“怎么？伙计，你疯了！"麦克默多说道，“这地方不是经常塞满警察和侦探吗？他们对我们又有什么损害呢？”</p> 
<p>“不，不，这并不是本地人。正象你说的，那些本地人，我们都知道，他们是干不出什么名堂的，可是你听说过平克顿的侦探吗？”</p> 
<p>“我听说过几个人的名字。”</p> 
<p>“好，我可以告诉你，他们追查你时，你可不要不在意。那不是一家漫不经心的政府机构，而是一个十分认真的起业中的智囊，它决心要查个水落石出，不择手段地要搞出个结果来。假如一个平克顿的侦探要插手过问这件事，那我们就全毁了。”</p> 
<p>“我们必须杀死他。”</p> 
<p>“啊，你首先想到的就是这个！那就一定要在会上提出来了。我不是向你说过，结果会出谋杀案件吗？”</p> 
<p>“当然了，杀人算什么？在此地不是极普通的事吗？”</p> 
<p>“的确，是这样，可是我并没有想叫这个人被杀啊。我心里又将永远不能平静了。可是不然的话，我们自己的生命也是危险的。上帝啊，我怎么办呢？"他身体前后摇动，犹豫不决。</p> 
<p>他的话使麦克默多深受感动。不难看出，麦克默多是同意莫里斯对危机的看法的，需要去应付它。麦克默多抚着莫里斯的肩膀，热情地摇摇他。</p> 
<p>“喂，伙计，"麦克默多非常激动，几乎喊叫似地大声说道，</p> 
<p>“你坐在这儿象老太太哭丧一样是毫无用处的。我们来摆摆情况。这个人是谁？他在哪里？你怎么听说到他的？为什么你来找我？”</p> 
<p>“我来找你，因为唯有你能指教我。我曾对你说过，在我来这里以前，我在西部地方开过一家商店。那里有我一些好朋友。有一个朋友是在电报局工作的。这就是我昨天收到的信，是他写给我的。这一页顶上就写得很清楚，你自己可以把它念一下。”</p> 
<p>麦克默多遂读道：</p> 
<p>"你们那里的死酷党人现在怎么样了？在报上看到许多有关他们的报道。你知我知，我希望不久就得到你的消息。听说，有五家有限公司和两处铁路局十分认真地着手处理这件事。他们既然有这种打算，那你可以确信，他们一定要到那里去的。他们正直接插手。平克顿侦探公司已经奉命进行调查，其中的佼佼者伯尔弟·爱德华正在行动，这些罪恶的事情现在完全可以得到制止了。”</p> 
<p>“请你把附言读一读。”</p> 
<p>“当然，我所告诉你的，是我从日常业务工作中了解到的，所以不能再进一步说清楚了。他们使用的是奇怪的密码，我不懂他们的意思。”</p> 
<p>麦克默多手里拿着这封信，无精打采地静坐了很久，一时间一团迷雾冉冉升起，在他面前呈现出万丈深渊。</p> 
<p>“还有别的人知道这件事吗？"麦克默多问道。</p> 
<p>“我没有告诉别的人。”</p> 
<p>“不过这个人，你的朋友，会写信给别的人吗？”</p> 
<p>“啊，我敢说他还认识一两个人。”</p> 
<p>“是会里人吗？”</p> 
<p>“很可能。”</p> 
<p>“我所以要问这个，因为或者他可以把伯尔弟·爱德华这个人的形状介绍一下。那么我们就可以着手追寻他的行踪了。”</p> 
<p>“啊，这倒可以。可是我不认为他认识爱德华。他告诉我这个消息，也是从日常业务中得到的，他怎么能认识这个平克顿的侦探呢？”</p> 
<p>麦克默多猛然跳起来。</p> 
<p>“天哪！"他喊道，“我一定要抓住他。我连这事都不知道，该是多么愚蠢哪！不过我们还算幸运！趁他还未能造成损害，我们可以先收拾他。喂，莫里斯，你愿意把这件事交给我去办吗？”</p> 
<p>“当然了，只要你能不连累我就行。”</p> 
<p>“我一定办这件事，你完全可撒手让我来办。我甚至用不着提你的名字，我一人作事一人当，就当作这封信是写给我的。这可使你满意了吧？”</p> 
<p>“这样办正合我的心意。”</p> 
<p>“那么，就谈到这里，你要保持缄默。现在我要到分会去，我们很快就可以让这个老平克顿侦探垂头丧气了。”</p> 
<p>“你们不会杀死这个人吧？”</p> 
<p>“莫里斯，我的朋友，你知道得越少，你越可以问心无愧。你最好去睡大觉，不要再多问了，让这件事听其自然吧。现在我来处理它。”</p> 
<p>莫里斯走时，忧愁地摇了摇头，叹道：</p> 
<p>“我觉得我的双手沾满了他的鲜血。”</p> 
<p>“无论如何，自卫不能算是谋杀，"麦克默多狞笑道，“不是我们杀死他，就是他杀死我们。如果我们让他长久呆在山谷里，我想他会把我们一网打尽的。呃，莫里斯兄弟，我们还要选你做身主呢，因为你真正救了我们整个死酷党。”</p> 
<p>然而从他的行动可以清楚地看出来，他虽然这么说，可是却十分认真地思考这件新获得的消息。可能他问心有愧；可能由于平克顿组织威名显赫；可能知道这些庞大而富有的有限公司自己动手清除死酷党人，不管他出于哪种考虑，他的行动说明他是从最坏处作准备的。在他离家以前，把凡是能把他牵连进刑事案件的片纸只字都销毁了。然后他才满意地出口长气，似乎觉得安全了。可是危险还压在他心上，因为在去分会途中，他又在老谢夫特家停了下来。谢夫特已经禁止麦克默多到他家去。可是麦克默多轻轻敲了敲窗户，伊蒂便出来迎接他。她情人双目中的残暴表情消逝了，但伊蒂从他严肃的脸上看到发生了什么危险的事。</p> 
<p>“你一定出了什么事！"伊蒂高声喊道，“噢，杰克，你一定遇到了危险！”</p> 
<p>“不错，我亲爱的，不过这并不是很坏的事。在事情没有恶化以前，我们把家搬一搬，那就是很明智的了。”</p> 
<p>“搬家？”</p> 
<p>“有一次我答应你，将来我要离开这里。我想这一天终于来到了。今晚我得到一个消息，是一个坏消息，我看麻烦事来了。”</p> 
<p>“是警察吗？”</p> 
<p>“对，是一个平克顿的侦探。不过，亲爱的，你不用打听到底是怎么回事，也不必知道这件事对我这样的人会怎么样。这件事与我关系太大了，但我很快就会摆脱它的。你说过，如果我离开这里，你要和我一起走。”</p> 
<p>“啊，杰克，这会使你得救的。”</p> 
<p>“我是一个诚实的人，伊蒂，我不会伤害你那美丽身躯的一根毫发。你仿佛坐在云端的黄金宝座上，我常常瞻望你的容颜，却决不肯从那里把你拖下一英寸来。你相信我吗？”</p> 
<p>伊蒂默默无言地把手放在麦克默多的手掌中。</p> 
<p>“好，那么，请你听我说，并且照我说的去做。因为这确实是我们唯一的生路。我确信，谷中将有大事发生。我们许多人都需要加以提防。无论如何，我是其中的一个。如果我离开这里，不论日夜，你都要和我一起走！”</p> 
<p>“我一定随后就去，杰克。”</p> 
<p>“不，不，你一定要和我一起走。如果我离开这个山谷，我就永远不能再回来，或许我要躲避警察耳目，连通信的机会也没有，我怎能把你丢下呢？你一定要和我一起走。我来的那地方有一个好女人，我把你安顿到那里，我们再结婚。你肯走吗？”</p> 
<p>“好的，杰克，我随你走。”</p> 
<p>“你这样相信我，上帝保佑你！如果我辜负了你的信任，那我就是一个从地狱里钻出来的魔鬼了。现在，伊蒂，请你注意，只要我带一个便笺给你，你接到它，就要抛弃一切，直接到车站候车室，在那里等候，我会来找你。”</p> 
<p>“接到你写的便笺，不管白天晚上，我一定去，杰克。”</p> 
<p>麦克默多作好了出走的准备工作，心情稍稍舒畅了些，便向分会走去。那里已经聚满了人。他回答了暗号，通过了戒备森严的外围警戒和内部警卫。麦克默多一走进来，便受到热烈的欢迎。长长的房屋挤满了人，他从烟雾之中看到了身主麦金蒂那乱成一团的又长又密的黑发，鲍德温凶残而不友好的表情，书记哈拉威那鹫鹰一样的脸孔，以及十几个分会中的领导人物。他很高兴，他们都在这里，可以商议一下他得来的消息。</p> 
<p>“真的，我们看到你很高兴，兄弟！"身主麦金蒂高声喊道，</p> 
<p>“这里正有一件事需要有一个所罗门作出公正的裁决呢。"①</p> 
<p>①所罗门：（Solomon）古以色列王国国王大卫之子，以智慧著称。——译者注</p> 
<p>“是兰德和伊根，"麦克默多坐下来，邻座的人向他解释说，“他们两个人去枪杀斯蒂列斯镇的克雷布老人，两个人都抢着要分会的赏金，你来说说究竟是谁开枪击中的？”</p> 
<p>麦克默多从座位上站起来，把手举起，他面上的表情，使大家都吃惊地注意着他。出现一阵死一样的寂静，等待他讲话。</p> 
<p>“可敬的身主，"麦克默多严肃地说道，“我有紧急的事报告！”</p> 
<p>“既然麦克默多兄弟有紧急事报告，"麦金蒂说道，“按照会中规定，自然应该优先讨论。现在，兄弟，请你说吧。”</p> 
<p>麦克默多从衣袋里拿出信来。</p> 
<p>“可敬的身主和诸位弟兄，"麦克默多说道，“今天，我带来一个不幸的消息。不过我们事先知道并加以讨论，总比毫无戒备就被一网打尽要好得多。我得到通知说，国内那些最有钱有势的组织联合起来准备消灭我们，有一个平克顿的侦探，一个名叫伯尔弟·爱德华的人已来到这个山谷搜集证据，以便把绞索套到我们许多人的脖子上，并把在座的各位送进重罪犯牢房。所以我说有紧急事要报告，请大家讨论。”</p> 
<p>室中顿时鸦雀无声，最后还是身主麦金蒂打破了沉寂。</p> 
<p>“麦克默多兄弟，你有什么证据吗？"麦金蒂问道。</p> 
<p>“我收到一封信，这些情况就在这封信里写着，"麦克默多说道。他高声把这一段话读了一遍，又说，“我要守信用，不能再把这封信的详细内容都读出来，也不能把信交到你们手里，但我敢向你们保证，信上再也没有与本会利益攸关的事了。我一接到信，立即前来向诸位报告这件事。”</p> 
<p>“请允许我讲一讲，"一个年纪较大的弟兄说道，“我听说过伯尔弟·爱德华这个人，他是平克顿私家侦探公司里一个最有名片的侦探。”</p> 
<p>“有人见过他吗？”</p> 
<p>“是的，"麦克默多说道，“我见过他。”</p> 
<p>室内顿时出现一阵惊诧的低语声。</p> 
<p>“我相信他跑不出我们的手心，"麦克默多笑容满面，继续说道，“假如我们干得迅速而机智，很快就可以把这件事解决好。如果你们信得过我，再给我一些帮助，那我们就更没有什么可怕的了。”</p> 
<p>“可是，我们怕什么呢？他怎么能知道我们的事呢？”</p> 
<p>“参议员先生，如果大家都象你那样忠诚，你就可以这样说。可是这个人有那些资本家的百万资本做靠山。你难道以为我们会里就没有一个意志薄弱的弟兄可以被收买吗？他会弄到我们的秘密的——甚至可能已经把秘密弄到手了。现在只有一种可靠的对策。”</p> 
<p>“那就是不叫他生离这山谷！"鲍德温说道。</p> 
<p>麦克默多点点头。</p> 
<p>“你说得好，鲍德温兄弟，"麦克默多说道，“你我过去往往意见不合，可是今晚你倒说对了。”</p> 
<p>“那么，他在哪里呢？我们在哪里能见到他？”</p> 
<p>“可敬的身主，"麦克默多热情洋溢地说道，“我要向你建议，这对我们是一件生死攸关的大事，不便在会上公开讨论。我并不是不信任在座的哪位弟兄。可是只要有只言片语传到那个侦探耳中，我们就会失掉抓到他的一切机会。我要求分会选择一些最可靠的人。假如我可以提议的话，参议员先生，你自己算一个，还有鲍德温兄弟，再找五个人。那么我就可以自由地发表我所知道的一切，也可以说一说我打算怎么做了。”</p> 
<p>麦克默多的建议马上被采纳了。选出的人员除了麦金蒂和鲍德温以外，还有面如鹫鹰的书记哈拉威、老虎科马克、凶残的中年杀人凶手司库卡特和不顾生死的亡命徒威拉比两兄弟。</p> 
<p>大家精神上仿佛笼罩了一片乌云，许多人头一次开始看到，在他们居住得那么久的地方，一片为被害者复仇的乌云——法律，弥漫在晴空。他们施加于他人的恐怖，过去被他们认为是远不会遭到报应的，现在却使他们大吃一惊，这种果报来得如此急迫，紧压在他们头上。所以党徒们例常的欢宴，这次却抑郁不欢，草草收场了。党徒们很早就走开了。只有他们的头领们留下议事。</p> 
<p>“麦克默多，现在你说吧，"他们孤零零的七个人呆呆地坐在那里，麦金蒂说道。</p> 
<p>“我刚才说过我认识伯尔弟·爱德华，"麦克默多解释说，</p> 
<p>“我用不着告诉你们，你们就可想到，他在这里用的不是这个名字。他是一个勇敢的人，不是一个蠢才。他诡称名叫史蒂夫·威尔逊，住在霍布森领地。”</p> 
<p>“你怎么知道的呢？”</p> 
<p>“因为我和他讲过话。那时我没有想到这些，要不是收到这封信，我连想也不会再想这件事了。可是现在我深信这就是那个人了。星期三我有事到霍布森领地去，在车上遇到他。他说他是一个记者，那时我相信了他的话。他说他要为纽约一家报纸写稿，想知道有关死酷党人的一切情况，还要了解他所谓的'暴行'，他向我问了各种各样问题，打算弄到一些情况。你们可以相信，我什么也没有泄露。他说，‘如果我能得到对我编辑工作有用的材料，我愿出重金酬谢，'我拣我认为他最爱听的话说了一遍，他便付给我一张二十元纸币作酬金。他又说，'如果你能把我所需要的一切告诉给我，那我就再加十倍酬金。'”</p> 
<p>“那么，你告诉他些什么？”</p> 
<p>“我可以虚构出任何材料。”</p> 
<p>“你怎么知道他不是一个报馆的人呢？”</p> 
<p>“我可以告诉你们，他在霍布森领地下了车，我也随着下了车。我走进了电报局，他刚从那里离开。</p> 
<p>“'喂，'在他走出去以后，报务员说道，‘这种电文，我想我们应当加倍收费才对。'我说，‘我想你们是应当加倍收的。'我们都觉得他填写的电报单象中文那么难懂。这个职员又说：'他每天都来发一份电报。'我说，‘对，这是他报纸的特别新闻，他怕别人知道。'这就是那时候那个报务员和我所想到的。可是现在我想的却截然不同了。”</p> 
<p>“天哪！我相信你的话是真的，"麦金蒂说道，“可是你认为我们应该怎样对付这件事呢？”</p> 
<p>“为什么不立刻去收拾他呢？"有一个党徒提议说。</p> 
<p>“哎，不错，愈早愈好。”</p> 
<p>“如果我知道他住在哪里，我就立刻这样去做了，"麦克默多说道，“我只知道他在霍布森领地，可不知道他的寓所。不过，只要你们接受我的建议，我倒有一个计划。”</p> 
<p>“好，什么计划？”</p> 
<p>“明天早晨我就到霍布森领地去，我通过报务员去找他。我想，他能打听出这个人的住处。好，那么，我可以告诉他我自己就是一个自由人会会员。我告诉他，只要他肯出高价，我就把分会的秘密告诉他。他一定会同意。那时我就告诉他，材料在我家里。因为到处都有人，不便让他白天到我家去。他自然知道这是一种起码的常识。我让他夜晚十点钟来我家看那些材料，那时我们一定可以抓住他了。”</p> 
<p>“这样好吗？”</p> 
<p>“其余的事，你们可以自己去筹划。寡妇麦克娜玛拉家是一座孤零零的住宅。她绝对可靠而且聋得象一根木桩。只有斯坎伦和我住在她寓所。假如他答应来的话，我就告诉你们，我会让你们七个人九点钟到我这里来。我们就把他搞进屋。假如他还能活着出去，嗯，那他后半辈子就可以大吹伯尔弟·爱德华的运气了。”</p> 
<p>“这么说，平克顿侦探公司该有一个空缺了。要不，就是我弄错了，"麦金蒂说道，“就谈到这里吧，麦克默多。明天九点钟我们到你那儿去。他走进来以后，你只要把门关上，其它的事就由我们处理好了。”</p>
