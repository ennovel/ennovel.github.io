<p>&nbsp; Had he also set that fire?</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Sitting in the interrogation room across from Ronald Grayson, I thought about another teenager, Scott Dyleski. Dyleski was sixteen when he’d broken into a woman’s home in Lafayette, stabbed her dozens of times, and mutilated her body because in his twisted mind, he imagined that she’d taken delivery of his drug paraphernalia and was keeping it from him. Dyleski was wrong, psychotic, and the murder should never have happened.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; But it had.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; And so, as I looked at fifteen-year-old Ronald Grayson with his clear skin and dark hair, drumming his fingers on the tabletop as though we were wasting his time, I wondered if he had doomed Pat and Bert Malone to horrific deaths so he could steal their stuff in order to buy drugs. I used my most patient and friendly tone of voice.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Ron, why don’t you tell us what happened?”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “I have nothing to say.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “That’s your right,” Jacobi grumbled menacingly.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Jacobi is five eleven, over two hundred pounds of well-marbled muscle, with lumpy features, hard gray eyes, gray hair, and a shiny gold badge. I would have expected the kid to show either fear or deference, but he seemed unfazed by our bad lieutenant.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “I don’t want to talk to you about the cocaine, you little shit,” Jacobi said, breathing into Grayson’s face. “But, man-to-man, tell us about the fire and we’ll help you with the coke charge. Do you understand me? I’m trying to help you.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Leave me alone, you fat fuck,” Grayson said.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Before Jacobi could smack the back of the kid’s head, his father, Vincent Grayson, and his lawyer blew through the door. Grayson was livid. “Ronnie, don’t say anything.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “I didn’t, Dad.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Grayson turned his fury on Jacobi. “You can’t talk to my son unless I’m with him. I know the law.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Save it, Mr. Grayson,” Jacobi growled. “Your imbecile son is under arrest for using and dealing, and I haven’t talked to him about the drugs at all.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; The lawyer’s name was Sam Farber, and from his business card I gathered that he had a one-man practice doing wills and real estate closings.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “I’m telling you and you and you,” Jacobi said, pointing his finger at the kid, his father, and the lawyer in turn. “I’ll lobby the DA on Ronald’s behalf if he helps us with the fire. That’s our only interest in him right now.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “My client is a good Samaritan,” Farber said, dragging up a chair, squaring his leather briefcase with the edge of the table before opening it. “His father was with him when he made the call to 911. That’s all he had to do with it, end of story.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Mr. Farber, we all know that the person who calls in the fire has to be cleared of setting it,” I said. “But Ronald hasn’t convinced us that he had nothing to do with it.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Go ahead, Ron,” said Farber.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Ron Grayson’s eyes slid across mine and up to the camera in the corner of the room. He mumbled, “I was in the car with my dad. I smelled smoke. I told Dad which way to drive. Then I saw the fire coming out of that house. I dialed 911 on my cell and reported it. That’s all.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “What time was this?”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “It was ten thirty.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Mr. Grayson, I asked your son.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Look. My son was sitting next to me in the car! The guy at the gas station can vouch for Ronnie. They cleaned the windshields together.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Ronnie, did you know the Malones?” I asked.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Who?”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “The people who lived in the house.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Never heard of them.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Did you see anyone leaving the house?”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “No.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Ever been to Palo Alto?”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “I’ve never been anywhere in Mexico.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Do you have enough, Inspectors?” Farber said. “My client has cooperated fully.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “I want to take a look at his room,” I said.</p>
