<p>&nbsp; “I was close to their daughter when I was in high school,” Conklin said. “Kelly Malone. Her parents were great to me.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “I’m so sorry, Rich.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “I haven’t seen them since Kelly went off to the University of Colorado,” Conklin said. “This is going to kill her.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; I put my hand on his shoulder, knowing that we were going to treat the Malones’ deaths as homicides unless it was proven otherwise. Upstairs, the fire crew was doing mop-up and overhaul, dismantling the second-story ceiling, putting out hot spots under the eaves.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “The security system was off,” Hanni said, joining us. “The fire department got the call from a neighbor. The fire started in this room,” he said, pointing out the furniture that had been burned low to the ground.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; He looked around the room at the mounds of plaster and debris. “After we sift through all this, I’ll let you know if I find anything, but I think you can pretty much kiss off any notes or fingerprints.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “But you’ll try anyway, right?” Conklin said.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “I said I would, Rich.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Last thing we needed was for Conklin to get into a fight. I asked him what the Malones were like.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Kelly said her dad could be a prick,” Rich said, “but when you’re eighteen, that could’ve meant he wouldn’t let her stay out with me past eleven.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Tell me whatever else you remember.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Bert sold luxury cars. Patty was a homemaker. They had money, obviously. They entertained a lot. Their friends seemed nice - regular parents, you know.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Wouldn’t be the first time regular people turned out to be twisted,” Hanni muttered.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; A sweep of headlights drew my eyes toward the broken plate glass window. The coroner’s van joined the fleet of law enforcement and fire department vehicles on the street.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Noonan called out to me. “I checked out the bedroom on the second floor, Sarge. There’s a safe in the closet. The lock and the safe are intact, but the door is open - and the safe is empty.”</p>
