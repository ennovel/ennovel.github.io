It was Chief Anthony Tracchio, and his voice was unusually loud.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “What is it, Tony?”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “I need the two of you in my office, pronto.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; After a short volley of useless quibble, he hung up.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Fifteen minutes later, Conklin and I walked into Tracchio’s wood-paneled corner suite and saw two well-known people seated in the leather armchairs. Former governor Connor Hume Campion’s face looked swollen with rage, and his much younger wife, Valentina, appeared heavily sedated.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; The front page of the Sunday Chronicle was on Tracchio’s desk. I could read the headline upside down and from ten feet away: SUSPECT QUESTIONED IN CAMPION DISAPPEARANCE.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Cindy hadn’t waited for my quote, damn it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; What the hell had she written?</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Tracchio patted his Vitalis comb-over and introduced us to the parents of the missing boy as Conklin and I dragged chairs up to his massive desk. Connor Campion acknowledged us with a hard stare. “I had to read this in the newspaper?” he said to me. “That my son died in a whorehouse?”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; I flushed, then said, “If we’d had anything solid, Mr. Campion, we would have made sure you knew first. But all we have is an anonymous tip that your son visited a prostitute. We get crank tips constantly. It could have meant nothing.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Could have meant? So what’s in this paper is true?”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “I haven’t read that article, Mr. Campion, but I can give you an update.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Tracchio lit up a cigar as I filled the former governor in on our last eighteen hours: the interviews, our futile searches for evidence, and that we had Junie Moon in custody based on her uncorroborated admission that Michael had died in her arms. When I stopped talking, Campion shot out of his seat, and I realized that while we had assumed Michael was dead, the Campions hadn’t given up hope. My sketchy report had given the Campions more of a reality check than they’d expected.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; It wasn’t what they wanted to hear.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Campion turned his red-faced glare on Tracchio, a man who’d become chief of police by way of an undistinguished career in administration.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “I want my son’s body returned to us if every dump in the state has to be picked through by hand.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Consider it done,” Tracchio said.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Campion turned to me, and I saw his anger collapse. Tears filled his eyes. I touched his arm and said, “We’re on this, sir. Full-time. We won’t sleep until we find Michael.”</p>
