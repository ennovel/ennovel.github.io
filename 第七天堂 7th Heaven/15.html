<p>&nbsp; She was followed by her attorney, Melody Chado, a public defender who would make a reputation for herself with this case, no matter how the jury decided. Chado wore black - tunic, pants, jet-black beads - and was all business. She settled her client in a chair, opened her black leather briefcase, and looked at her watch several times as we waited. There were only four chairs in the small room, so when my good friend Assistant District Attorney Yuki Castellano entered a moment later, there was standing room only.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Yuki put down her briefcase and leaned against the wall.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Ms. Chado appeared to be just out of law school. She was probably only a couple of years older than her client, who looked so vulnerable I felt a little sorry for her - and that pissed me off.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “I’ve advised my client not to make any statements,” Ms. Chado said, setting her young face with a hard-ass expression that I found hard to take seriously. “This is your meeting, Ms. Castellano.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “I’ve talked with the DA,” Yuki said. “We’re charging your client with murder two.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “What happened to ‘illegal disposal of a body’?” Chado asked.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “That’s just not good enough,” Yuki snapped. “Your client was the last person to see Michael Campion alive. Ms. Moon never called medical emergency or the police - and why not? Because she didn’t care about Campion’s life or death. She only cared about herself.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “You’ll never get an indictment for murder,” Chado said. “There’s enough reasonable doubt in your theory to fill the ocean.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Listen to me, Junie,” Yuki said. “Help us locate Michael’s remains. If it can be determined in autopsy that his heart attack would have killed him no matter what you did, we’ll drop the murder charge and pretty much get out of your life.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “No deal,” Chado interjected. “What if she helps you find his body and it is so decomposed that his heart is just rotted meat? Then you’ll have a demonstrable connection to my client and she’ll be screwed.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; I reevaluated Melody Chado as she fought with Yuki. Chado had either had a great education, grown up in a family of lawyers - or both. Junie fell back in her chair, turned a shocked face toward her breathless attorney. I guessed that Chado’s description had blown off whatever romance was left of Junie’s memory of Michael Campion.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “I want to hear about the knife, Junie,” Rich said, steering the interview to our only piece of evidence.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “The knife?” Junie asked.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “We found a knife under your sofa. Looks like bloodstains on the blade. It’ll take a few days to get the DNA results, but if you help us, Ms. Castellano will take that as another sign of your cooperation.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Don’t answer,” said Melody Chado. “We’re done.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Junie was looking at Rich, and she was talking over her attorney. “I thought the knife went into one of the garbage bags,” she said to my partner. “So I don’t know what knife you found. But listen, I remember the name of the town.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Junie, that’s enough. That’s all!”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “I think it was Johnson,” Junie said to Rich. “I saw a sign when we got off the highway.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Jackson?” I asked. “Was it Jackson?”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Yes. That’s right.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “You’re sure about that? I thought you said you drove up the coast.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “I’m pretty sure. It was late, I got confused. I wasn’t trying to remember,” she told me, her eyes downcast. “I was trying to forget.”</p>
