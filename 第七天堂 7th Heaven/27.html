Rachel Savino, for instance, lived next door to the Malones in a sprawling Mediterranean-style house. She was an attractive brunette of about forty, wearing tight slacks, a tighter blouse, the break in the tan line on her ring finger telling me she was a recent divorc&amp;#233;e.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; She wouldn’t let us inside her door.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Savino eyed my dusty blue trousers, man-tailored shirt, and blazer, and did a double take when she noticed my shoulder holster. She barely acknowledged Jacobi. I guess we didn’t look like residents of Presidio Heights. So Jacobi and I stood on her terra-cotta steps while her pack of corgis jumped and yelped around us.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Have you ever seen this young man?” I asked, showing her a Polaroid of Ronald Grayson.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “No. I don’t think so.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Have you seen anyone hanging around or driving by who may have seemed out of place in the neighborhood?” asked Jacobi.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Darwin! Shut up! I don’t think so, no.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Any kids or cars that don’t belong here? Anyone ring your bell who seemed out of place? Any suspicious phone calls or deliveries?”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; No. No. No.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; And now she was asking questions. What about the fire at the Malones’? Was it an accident as she had assumed? Were we suggesting that it was deliberately set?</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Had the Malones been murdered?</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Jacobi said, “We’re just doing an investigation, Ms. Savino. No need to get your bowels in an -”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; I cut him off. “What about your dogs?” I asked. “Did they set up any kind of an uproar last night at around ten thirty?”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “The fire trucks made them crazy, but not before.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Do you find it unusual that the Malones didn’t arm their security system?” I asked.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “I don’t think they even locked their doors,” she said. And that was her final word. She opened her door, let in the pack, then closed it firmly behind her, locks and bolts clicking into place.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Over four hours and a dozen interviews later, Jacobi and I had learned that the Malones were churchgoing, well liked, generous, friendly, and got along well together, and not one soul knew of anyone who hated them. They were the perfect couple. So who had killed them, and why?</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Jacobi was grousing about his aching feet when my cell phone rang. Conklin, calling from the car.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “I looked up that pyramid symbol on the dollar bill,” he said. “It has to do with the Masons, a secret society that goes back to the 1700s. George Washington was a Mason. So was Benjamin Franklin. Most of the Founding Fathers.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Yeah, okay. How about Bert Malone? Was he a Mason?”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Kelly says no way. She’s with me now, Lindsay. We’re heading over to her parents’ house.”</p>
