The onlookers were back in their beds, and as the sounds of hammering cracked through the otherwise silent neighborhood, Hanni said, “There was a fire four months ago in Palo Alto, reminds me of this one.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “How so?”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Big, expensive house. The alarm was turned off. Two people died in the living room, and I had the same question in my mind: Why didn’t they leave?”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Panic, disorientation, like you were saying.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Yeah, it happens. But since I wasn’t called in until a couple of days after the fire, I couldn’t know for sure. Drives me crazy when the fire department decides the fire’s accidental without an arson investigator present. Anyway, the bodies were cremated at the funeral home by the time I was called.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “You thought the fire was suspicious?” Conklin asked.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Hanni nodded. “I still think so. The victims were good people, and they had money. But no one could come up with a motive for anyone to kill Henry and Peggy Jablonsky - not revenge, not insurance fraud, not even ‘I hate your face.’ So I was left with a bad feeling and no way to tell if the fire was arson or a spark flew out of the fireplace and lit up the Christmas tree.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “I guess you didn’t find a book with Latin written inside,” I said.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “By the time I got there, the ‘evidence eradication unit’ had tossed a mountain of soaked household goods into the front yard. I guess I wasn’t looking for a book.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Hanni took his car keys out of his pocket. “Okay, guys, I’m done. See you in a few hours.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Rich and I stood back from his van as the arson investigator drove off.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Were you able to reach Kelly?” I asked my partner.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “Got her answering machine. I didn’t know what to say.” He shook his head. “I finally said, ‘It’s Rich. Conklin. I know it’s been a long time, Kelly. But. Um. Could you call me right away?’ ”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “That’s good. That’s fine.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp; “I don’t know. She’ll either think I’m a psycho for calling her at one in the morning to say hello after twelve years. Or, if she knows that I’m a cop, I just scared the hell out of her.”</p>
