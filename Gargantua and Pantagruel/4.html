<p>No sooner did the Cymbrians’ overcomer</p> 
<p>Pass through the air to shun the dew of summer,</p> 
<p>But at his coming straight great tubs were fill’d,</p> 
<p>With pure fresh butter down in showers distill’d:</p> 
<p>Wherewith when water’d was his grandam, Hey,</p> 
<p>Aloud he cried, Fish it, sir, I pray y’;</p> 
<p>Because his beard is almost all beray’d;</p> 
<p>Or, that he would hold to ‘m a scale, he pray’d.</p> 
<p>To lick his slipper, some told was much better,</p> 
<p>Than to gain pardons, and the merit greater.</p> 
<p>In th’ interim a crafty chuff approaches,</p> 
<p>From the depth issued, where they fish for roaches;</p> 
<p>Who said, Good sirs, some of them let us save,</p> 
<p>The eel is here, and in this hollow cave</p> 
<p>You’ll find, if that our looks on it demur,</p> 
<p>A great waste in the bottom of his fur.</p> 
<p>To read this chapter when he did begin,</p> 
<p>Nothing but a calf’s horns were found therein;</p> 
<p>I feel, quoth he, the mitre which doth hold</p> 
<p>My head so chill, it makes my brains take cold.</p> 
<p>Being with the perfume of a turnip warm’d,</p> 
<p>To stay by chimney hearths himself he arm’d,</p> 
<p>Provided that a new thill-horse they made</p> 
<p>Of every person of a hair-brain’d head.</p> 
<p>They talked of the bunghole of Saint Knowles,</p> 
<p>Of Gilbathar and thousand other holes,</p> 
<p>If they might be reduced t’ a scarry stuff,</p> 
<p>Such as might not be subject to the cough:</p> 
<p>Since ev’ry man unseemly did it find,</p> 
<p>To see them gaping thus at ev’ry wind:</p> 
<p>For, if perhaps they handsomely were closed,</p> 
<p>For pledges they to men might be exposed.</p> 
<p>In this arrest by Hercules the raven</p> 
<p>Was flayed at her (his) return from Lybia haven.</p> 
<p>Why am not I, said Minos, there invited?</p> 
<p>Unless it be myself, not one’s omitted:</p> 
<p>And then it is their mind, I do no more</p> 
<p>Of frogs and oysters send them any store:</p> 
<p>In case they spare my life and prove but civil,</p> 
<p>I give their sale of distaffs to the devil.</p> 
<p>To quell him comes Q.B., who limping frets</p> 
<p>At the safe pass of tricksy crackarets:</p> 
<p>The boulter, the grand Cyclops’ cousin, those</p> 
<p>Did massacre, whilst each one wiped his nose:</p> 
<p>Few ingles in this fallow ground are bred,</p> 
<p>But on a tanner’s mill are winnowed.</p> 
<p>Run thither all of you, th’ alarms sound clear,</p> 
<p>You shall have more than you had the last year.</p> 
<p>Short while thereafter was the bird of Jove</p> 
<p>Resolved to speak, though dismal it should prove;</p> 
<p>Yet was afraid, when he saw them in ire,</p> 
<p>They should o’erthrow quite flat down dead th’ empire.</p> 
<p>He rather choosed the fire from heaven to steal,</p> 
<p>To boats where were red herrings put to sale;</p> 
<p>Than to be calm ‘gainst those, who strive to brave us,</p> 
<p>And to the Massorets’ fond words enslave us.</p> 
<p>All this at last concluded gallantly,</p> 
<p>In spite of Ate and her hern-like thigh,</p> 
<p>Who, sitting, saw Penthesilea ta’en,</p> 
<p>In her old age, for a cress-selling quean.</p> 
<p>Each one cried out, Thou filthy collier toad,</p> 
<p>Doth it become thee to be found abroad?</p> 
<p>Thou hast the Roman standard filch’d away,</p> 
<p>Which they in rags of parchment did display.</p> 
<p>Juno was born, who, under the rainbow,</p> 
<p>Was a-bird-catching with her duck below:</p> 
<p>When her with such a grievous trick they plied</p> 
<p>That she had almost been bethwacked by it.</p> 
<p>The bargain was, that, of that throatful, she</p> 
<p>Should of Proserpina have two eggs free;</p> 
<p>And if that she thereafter should be found,</p> 
<p>She to a hawthorn hill should be fast bound.</p> 
<p>Seven months thereafter, lacking twenty-two,</p> 
<p>He, that of old did Carthage town undo,</p> 
<p>Did bravely midst them all himself advance,</p> 
<p>Requiring of them his inheritance;</p> 
<p>Although they justly made up the division,</p> 
<p>According to the shoe-welt-law’s decision,</p> 
<p>By distributing store of brews and beef</p> 
<p>To these poor fellows that did pen the brief.</p> 
<p>But th’ year will come, sign of a Turkish bow,</p> 
<p>Five spindles yarn’d, and three pot-bottoms too,</p> 
<p>Wherein of a discourteous king the dock</p> 
<p>Shall pepper’d be under an hermit’s frock.</p> 
<p>Ah! that for one she hypocrite you must</p> 
<p>Permit so many acres to be lost!</p> 
<p>Cease, cease, this vizard may become another,</p> 
<p>Withdraw yourselves unto the serpent’s brother.</p> 
<p>’Tis in times past, that he who is shall reign</p> 
<p>With his good friends in peace now and again.</p> 
<p>No rash nor heady prince shall then rule crave,</p> 
<p>Each good will its arbitrement shall have;</p> 
<p>And the joy, promised of old as doom</p> 
<p>To the heaven’s guests, shall in its beacon come.</p> 
<p>Then shall the breeding mares, that benumb’d were,</p> 
<p>Like royal palfreys ride triumphant there.</p> 
<p>And this continue shall from time to time,</p> 
<p>Till Mars be fetter’d for an unknown crime;</p> 
<p>Then shall one come, who others will surpass,</p> 
<p>Delightful, pleasing, matchless, full of grace.</p> 
<p>Cheer up your hearts, approach to this repast,</p> 
<p>All trusty friends of mine; for he’s deceased,</p> 
<p>Who would not for a world return again,</p> 
<p>So highly shall time past be cried up then.</p> 
<p>He who was made of wax shall lodge each member</p> 
<p>Close by the hinges of a block of timber.</p> 
<p>We then no more shall Master, master, whoot,</p> 
<p>The swagger, who th’ alarum bell holds out;</p> 
<p>Could one seize on the dagger which he bears,</p> 
<p>Heads would be free from tingling in the ears,</p> 
<p>To baffle the whole storehouse of abuses.</p> 
<p>The thus farewell Apollo and the Muses.</p>
