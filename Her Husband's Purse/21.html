Jennie and Sadie were also curious as to that. But Daniel himself was curious, too. How was a husband to meet such unnatural behaviour in a wife? Did other men's wives so disregard their husbands' wishes and commands? If women got much more independent it would break up the holy estate of matrimony altogether.
<br> 
<br> He finally decided, on his homeward walk, that about the only course open to him was to take refuge in a dignified silence, though now that Margaret's time was drawing near, he felt sufficiently apprehensive of the outcome to be very leniently inclined toward her. Funny how he cared for her when she treated him the way she did! He could not help it, somehow. She certainly had a way with her! Well, when she was over her trial and quite herself again, he'd have another try at bringing her to a proper sense of the confederation to which he was accustomed and which was his due.
<br> 
<br> He wondered uneasily what the people of the town thought of this incongruous intimacy between his clerk and his wife. It certainly passed his comprehension as much as it did that of his sisters that a girl as "high-toned" as Margaret was should insist upon being intimate with his stenographer. That Miss Hamilton was equally "high-toned," he was incapable of recognizing. Jennie had voiced his own sentiments when a few days before she had exclaimed, "When she could run with anybody, she goes and picks out an office clerk! It's nothing else, Danny, but that she's bound to act contrary, to show us she don't care if she didn't bring you a dollar to her name!"
<br> 
<br> However, a letter which he found on the hall table when he reached home diverted not only his own attention, but that of the whole household, from Margaret's case.
<br> 
<br> It was from the school teacher of Martz Township, who wrote in behalf of his step-mother; and after dinner, as the family sat together, as was their custom, in the sitting-room, for an hour before Daniel went again to his office—Jennie and Sadie fussing about him to make him comfortable, adjusting the window-blind, placing his chair, handing him the newspaper, retying his necktie, brushing his coat collar—Daniel presently opened and read the letter he had received.
<br> 
<br> Margaret listened to it and to the lengthy discussion which followed with an attention that was to bear early and abundant fruit.
<br> 
<br> 
<br> "DEAR FRIEND:
<br> 
<br> "I am writing for Mrs. Leitzel, to leave you know she had it so bad in her lungs here the past couple weeks the neighbours thought it would give pneumonia, but she got better and now she's up again, but very weak, and I'm leaving you know that we think she ought not to live alone a half a mile away from her nearest neighbour, because if she got so sick that she couldn't help herself, she might die before her neighbours found it out yet that she needed help. And she's too feeble any more to make up her fires and fetch her water from the spring and chop her wood. The house not having any modern improvements, and so much out of repair, it makes it harder, too, for such an old woman. And she has hardly anything to live on. The neighbours say she had either ought to have some one with her, or you ought to take her to your home to live. If not, she'll have to go the poorhouse, and that of course you would not want, either.
<br> 
<br> "She is better now and says to tell you not to worry, but I warn you she may get down sick again any time, as old as what she is. And I think you have got good cause to worry, though I told her I'd tell you not to. If it hadn't been for the neighbours doing for her this last couple weeks, she'd have died.
<br> 
<br> "Yours truly,
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "MAYBELLE RAUCH.
<br> 
<br> "P.S. She says she sends her love to all and that you have got no need to worry."
<br> 
<br> 
<br> But Daniel and his sisters did seem to think they had "need to worry" very much, at the startling revelations of this letter, not the revelations as to their step-mother's sufferings and needs, but as to the neighbourhood publicity given to their neglect of her.
<br> 
<br> "To think she'd go and have that busybody teacher and all her other neighbours in and complain to 'em all like this, so's they write to us yet and ask for help for her! Well, this beats all! She never went this far before!" scolded Jennie.
<br> 
<br> "Yes, I don't see why she couldn't leave us know herself if she's got any complaints, and not put it out to the whole township like this!" Sadie worried.
<br> 
<br> "It certainly will make talk out there!" Daniel frowned.
<br> 
<br> "Enough to get into the newspapers if she doesn't watch out!"
<br> 
<br> "But how," Margaret ventured a question, "could she let you know except in the way she's taking, since she can't write herself? And how could she help having the neighbours in if she was ill and helpless and alone?"
<br> 
<br> "She could anyhow have sent us a postal card to say she was sick and wanted one of us to come out," said Jennie.
<br> 
<br> "Would you have gone to her?"
<br> 
<br> "Of course one of us would have gone."
<br> 
<br> "Maybe she couldn't even write a postal card, or get out to mail it if she did write it, if she's so old and feeble, and was ill."
<br> 
<br> "If that was the case," said Daniel, "then to avoid a repetition of the occurrence, I don't see what else we are to do but put her into a home."
<br> 
<br> "You know how she's against that, Danny," said Jennie. "If you decide to do it, you'll have a time with her! And those neighbours all taking her part!"
<br> 
<br> "This impertinent teacher," said Daniel, tapping the letter he held, "has the face to reproach us, you notice, for not keeping the place in repair! It wasn't our business to keep it in repair when we never get any rent for it."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, it does seem as if Mom might have kept it in repair when she was getting it rent free," said Jennie. "I don't see why she has not been able to save something in all these years from what she's earnt from her vegetable garden."
<br> 
<br> "She certainly hasn't managed good," said Sadie.
<br> 
<br> "And to think of the cheek of those neighbours!" said Jennie wrathfully. "Saying we had ought to take her in here to live with us yet! As if she was our own flesh and blood!"
<br> 
<br> "What would Hiram say to something like this coming!" Sadie speculated; "when he thinks we did too much in not charging her rent."
<br> 
<br> "Well," Daniel suddenly announced with a magnanimous air that seemed to swell his chest, "I'll send her a check. I'll send her five dollars. Maybe I'll make it ten."
<br> 
<br> "Ten dollars yet, Danny!" said Sadie, regarding her brother with affectionate admiration.
<br> 
<br> "I'm not sure I'll send as much as ten. But anyhow five."
<br> 
<br> "She'll be sure to show the check around to prove to those neighbours how good you are to her."
<br> 
<br> "And there will be some among them," said Daniel indignantly, "that will be ready enough to call it stingy!"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, well, some folks would say it was stingy if you sent her twenty-five dollars yet!"
<br> 
<br> "If you and Sadie want to put a little to what I send," Daniel tentatively suggested, "we might make it ten or fifteen."
<br> 
<br> "Well," said Jennie reluctantly, "it ain't fair for you to pay all, either. What do you say, Sadie?"
<br> 
<br> "Well," Sadie hesitatingly agreed; "for all, I did want to get a new fancy for my white hat. How much will you give, Jennie?"
<br> 
<br> "Well, if you and I each give two-fifty to Danny's five or ten, that ought to stop her neighbours' talking out there."
<br> 
<br> "All right," Sadie pensively agreed.
<br> 
<br> "No use asking Hiram to contribute," Daniel growled, "when he thinks we ought to charge her rent for the place. He gets angry whenever he hears I gave her a little. I told him once, 'If I can better afford than you can to give her a little, and I don't ask you to help out, what are you kicking about?' 'It's the principle of it,' he said. 'If you give her money, it's admitting you owe it to her, or you wouldn't give it to her. Now I contend that we don't owe her anything.' 'Well, then,' I said, 'when I give her a little now and then, I'll put it down on my accounts under Christian Charities. Will that satisfy you?' But no, even that didn't satisfy him. He's all for putting her to a home. And it looks now as if that's what we'll have to do pretty soon," Daniel concluded, rising to go to his office.
<br> 
<br> Margaret looked on in silence as Jennie and Sadie each counted out carefully from their purses two dollars and a half and passed it over to their brother.
<br> 
<br> "I'll send a check, then, to mother for fifteen dollars," he said as he put the money into his own purse. "I'll make it fifteen," he nodded. "I'm willing to make it fifteen. That will certainly settle the gossips out there and keep her going for a while comfortably."
<br> 
<br> He came across the room to Margaret's chair by the window.
<br> 
<br> "Good-bye, my dear," he said, bending to kiss her; and it took all her self-control not to shrink in utter repugnance from his caress.
<br> 
<br> "Oh!" she inwardly moaned as she turned to gaze out of the window when he had gone, "what crime have I committed in marrying a man I——"
<br> 
<br> But even her innermost secret thought recoiled from the admission that she despised her husband, the father of her child.
<br> 
<br> She went upstairs to her room to spend the time, while she waited for the hour of Catherine's arrival, in putting some last touches to the baby outfit she had made and in writing a note to Daniel's step-mother expressing her sympathy with her recent illness and reiterating her promise to come to see her as soon as possible after her confinement.
<br> 
<br> "I'll mail it myself," she decided as she sealed and stamped her letter, "or give it to Catherine to mail."
<br> 
<br> At four o'clock, feeling a little nervous, but quite determined, she went downstairs to await the signal ring at the door. As it was ten days since Catherine had been to the house, Margaret hoped that Emmy, the maid, was off her guard, unless the episode of this morning had caused Jennie and Sadie to renew their watchfulness.
<br> 
<br> "It's so stupid of them, to say the least, to imagine I'd submit to such interference in my own personal affairs!" she reflected.
<br> 
<br> She knew their suspicions would be aroused if they found her in the parlour, for of late she spent most of her time in her own room. But she felt quite ready to deal with them as effectively as she had done that morning.
<br> 
<br> She had not been downstairs long when a ring at the door-bell brought her to her feet, only to sink down again trembling, for it was not the four by twos agreed upon between her and Catherine; and a moment later Mrs. Ocksreider was shown into the parlour. Jennie and Sadie came directly into the room to receive with much satisfaction this distinguished and now frequent visitor who, until Daniel's marriage, had confined her calls on them to once a year; and they looked surprised to see Margaret already there.
<br> 
<br> "Were you expecting Mrs. Congressman Ocksreider that you're down already?" Jennie suspiciously inquired, when the sisters had greeted Mrs. Ocksreider obsequiously.
<br> 
<br> "No, but I'm expecting Miss Hamilton," Margaret quietly announced. "I have an appointment with her at four-thirty. When she comes, I shall have to ask you all to excuse me."
<br> 
<br> Jennie and Sadie looked the consternation they felt at Margaret's audacity, not to say disrespect, in asking such a person as Mrs. Ocksreider to excuse her because of an appointment with that Hamilton girl!
<br> 
<br> "It's to be hoped," Jennie rapidly thought, "that Mrs. Ocksreider will think it's a business appointment she's got with our Danny's clerk," while Sadie ostentatiously consulted her new wrist-watch to see how soon they might expect the objectionable Miss Hamilton.
<br> 
<br> "You and your husband's stenographer seem to be great friends," said Mrs. Ocksreider with what seemed to Margaret a rather malicious enjoyment of her sisters-in-law's evident discomfiture.
<br> 
<br> "We are," said Margaret.
<br> 
<br> "I've always heard those Hamiltons very well spoken of, as very nice, worthy people," Mrs. Ocksreider said in a tone of kindly condescension. "Where do they live, Mrs. Leitzel?"
<br> 
<br> That Mrs. Ocksreider shouldn't even know where they lived, put them of course outside the pale. Jennie and Sadie suffered acutely at Margaret's reply.
<br> 
<br> "They live in a small rented house on Green Street," she said, and added: "One of the few really distinguished homes in our town."
<br> 
<br> "'Distinguished?'" repeated Mrs. Ocksreider, puzzled.
<br> 
<br> "I mean, rather, it is a home that has distinction, by reason of its inmates and its furnishings."
<br> 
<br> "Its furnishings?" questioned Mrs. Ocksreider, still puzzled.
<br> 
<br> "Its pictures and books and general good taste. One of the few households that have pictures and books."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, but we all have pictures and books, Mrs. Leitzel!"
<br> 
<br> "Real pictures, I mean, and real books, too."
<br> 
<br> "But I'm sure most families of our class have the classics in their homes," Mrs. Ocksreider protested.
<br> 
<br> "The classics' do help to furnish a room nicely, don't they?" Margaret granted. "But the Hamiltons have books which they read. French and German as well as English."
<br> 
<br> "Well, of course, a public school teacher's home would be likely to have all kinds of books," Mrs. Ocksreider conceded, "that society people wouldn't buy."
<br> 
<br> "Of course," Margaret agreed.
<br> 
<br> "But I don't see why that should make their little home on Green Street what you called it—'distinguished.'"
<br> 
<br> "But I said the furnishings and the inmates gave it distinction. You see, I know because I am very intimate with them."
<br> 
<br> "I have heard that you were. It is so nice for your husband's little stenographer that you should take her up like that. It's so unusual, too. She's very fortunate, I'm sure."
<br> 
<br> "It's rather she that has taken me up. I'm quite proud that she thinks me worth the time she gives me. You see she's more than Mr. Leitzel's stenographer: she's an able law clerk. Mr. Leitzel says she's indispensable to him."
<br> 
<br> "Then he and his sisters share your enthusiasm over the Hamiltons?" Mrs. Ocksreider inquired in a tone of polite skepticism.
<br> 
<br> "I am the only one of us all who is intimate with them," Margaret complacently stated.
<br> 
<br> "I didn't see them at your reception last fall, did I?"
<br> 
<br> "They didn't come," Margaret readily answered. "You know they don't go into society at all."
<br> 
<br> Jennie and Sadie felt cold as they heard these shameless admissions, their Danny's wife bragging of her intimacy with people whom she openly advertised as living in a rented house on a side street and as not going into society! Not to go into society was, in the Leitzels' eyes, to be so abjectly unimportant as to make you want to get off the earth. And Margaret flaunted it!
<br> 
<br> "Ain't she the contrary piece though!" Jennie inwardly raged.
<br> 
<br> "Ah!" Margaret almost jumped from her chair as the door-bell at this moment rang "four by twos."
<br> 
<br> "That's Miss Hamilton now," she announced, rising and walking as quickly as she could (which was not very quick) across the room. "Will you please excuse me, Mrs. Ocksreider? I am sorry, but it is an appointment——"
<br> 
<br> But as she reached the door which opened into the hall, she saw the front door closed abruptly by Emmy, the maid.
<br> 
<br> Instantly stepping back into the parlour, Margaret hurried to the window, rapped upon it, then raised it and leaned out to speak to Miss Hamilton on the pavement. "Emmy made a mistake; I am at home, Catherine. Come back, and I'll open the door."
<br> 
<br> She closed the window and again made her way heavily across the room, smiling in a friendly way upon Mrs. Ocksreider as she passed her. "A mistake of the maid's. I'm seeing so few people just now," she dropped an explanation on her way.
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Ocksreider's subsequent description of the scene, in which the Leitzel sisters' horror at Mrs. Leitzel's innocent candour about "those Hamiltons," and the young woman's clever outwitting of her two would-be "keepers," afforded most delectable entertainment to New Munich society for two months to come.
