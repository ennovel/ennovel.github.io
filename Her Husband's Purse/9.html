<br> 
<br> "Can't I help you dress, dear?" she asked kindly.
<br> 
<br> "Will you hook this thing up the back, please, Hattie?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, but you are rash to wear this new chiffon waist, Margaret; chiffon mashes so easily, you know."
<br> 
<br> "But I'm not going out; I shall not be putting a wrap over it," said Margaret, looking at Harriet in surprise.
<br> 
<br> "I know you're not going out, but, Margaret, chiffon mashes so easily!"
<br> 
<br> "Well, I'll try to remember not to hold any of the children, though I'd rather mash the waist than forego that pleasure. Still, clothes are scarce and I've got no money for a trousseau——"
<br> 
<br> "Donkey! This will be your first tête-à-tête with Mr. Leitzel since your engagement, and he's quite crazy about you—and chiffon is most perishable."
<br> 
<br> Margaret looked at her blankly.
<br> 
<br> "Do you see no connection between the two facts, you goose?" demanded Harriet.
<br> 
<br> "Oh!" exclaimed Margaret. "Now I see what you mean!"
<br> 
<br> "Really?"
<br> 
<br> "But, Hattie, dear, you needn't be so—so explicit."
<br> 
<br> "'Explicit!' I nearly had to draw a diagram! Look here, Margaret, you're too thin; there's no excuse for anybody's looking as thin as you do when cotton wadding is so cheap."
<br> 
<br> "Recommend it to Mr. Leitzel; he's thinner than I am."
<br> 
<br> "I came in to tell you that Walter has ordered the wedding announcements and they will be finished in ten days; you and I and Mr. Leitzel can meantime be addressing the envelopes. I've drawn up a list of names; you can look over it and see whether I've forgotten any one. You must get Mr. Leitzel's list to-day."
<br> 
<br> "Very well."
<br> 
<br> Margaret turned away to her closet to hide the quick tears that sprang to her eyes at her sister's quite cold-blooded eagerness to speed her on her way. Harriet seemed to be almost feverishly fearful that something might intervene to stop the marriage if it were not quickly precipitated.
<br> 
<br> It was when her betrothed gave her, that evening, a diamond ring, that Margaret's strongest revulsion came to her, so strong that when she had conquered it, by reminding herself again of all the arguments by which she had brought herself to this pass, she had overcome for good and all any last remaining hesitation to accept her doom.
<br> 
<br> "You may think I was very extravagant, Margaret," Daniel said, as he held her hand and slipped the beautiful jewel upon her finger. "It cost me three hundred dollars. But you see, dear, a diamond is always property; capital safely invested. I'm only too glad and thankful that I can afford to give my affianced bride a costly diamond engagement ring. Is it tight enough?" he anxiously inquired. "I'm afraid it is a little loose; you better have it made tighter; no extra charge for that, they told me at the jeweller's. You might lose it if it's loose."
<br> 
<br> Margaret had a momentary impulse to tear the ring from her finger and fling it in his face, and such impulses were so foreign to her gentle disposition that she marvelled at herself.
<br> 
<br> "I'm glad it's property, Daniel," she returned with a perfunctory facetiousness, "for if you don't use me well, I can sell out to Isaac or Israel and run off! Or, if business got dull with you, we could fall back on our diamond ring!"
<br> 
<br> "My business get dull!" he laughed. It was rather delightful to know she was marrying him with so little idea of his great possessions; another proof of the fascination he had always had for ladies, according to Jennie and Sadie.
<br> 
<br> He was beginning to feel a little nervous at the thought of his sisters. Jennie, especially, would not like it that he was going ahead and getting married without consulting her. Of course, she and Sadie would both see, as soon as they came to know Margaret, that he had, even without their help, "struck a bonanza" in getting such a wife; so sweet-tempered and unselfish, so lovely looking, so healthy, such "a perfect lady," so "refined," except when she said "damn" and "devilish." He must warn her not to forget herself before his sisters—they'd never get over the shock. He had no doubt that eventually Jennie and Sadie would be as delighted with his "choice" as he was himself. He had told them so in his letter to them that day, assuring them that they would find his bride possessed of every quality they had always insisted upon in the girl he made his wife.
<br> 
<br> It did seem strange not to be able to tell them what Margaret's fortune was. He knew how eager they must be to know. He was beginning to feel very restive himself at not being enlightened on that score.
<br> 
<br> "Funny how I can't bring myself to ask her about it!" he wondered at himself for the hundredth time. "But she seems so disinterested in her love for me, how can I seem less so in mine for her? It would not look well!"
<br> 
<br> "Harriet wants you to draw up your list," Margaret here reminded him, "for the wedding announcements; she'd like to have it to-day."
<br> 
<br> "Harriet wants—— Is she running this wedding?" he asked suspiciously.
<br> 
<br> "Yes, quite so. You and she and I have got to address envelopes all day to-morrow, you know."
<br> 
<br> "Very well. I have already made out my list. It took a good deal of careful and thoughtful discrimination," he said, drawing a document from his pocket and unfolding it, "though not nearly so much as it would if I were being married in New Munich and having a large wedding. Mere announcements—one doesn't have to draw the line so carefully, you know, as in the case of invitations to one's house."
<br> 
<br> "'Draw the line?'" repeated Margaret questioningly; for social caste in South Carolina, being less fluid than in Pennsylvania, her family for generations had scarcely even rubbed against people of any other status than its own; and the gradations and shades of social difference with which Daniel had wrestled in making his list was something quite outside her experiences.
<br> 
<br> "Well, you see, every one we send announcements to," Daniel elucidated his meaning, "is bound to call on you; only too glad of the chance. And, naturally, you don't want undesirable people calling on you. If you didn't return their calls, you would make enemies of them; and while I am so fortunately situated that that would not make any material difference to us, still it is better to avoid making enemies if possible."
<br> 
<br> "But—I don't understand. How do you happen to have acquaintances that are 'undesirable,' and in what sense undesirable—so much so as to make it awkward to have to return their calls?"
<br> 
<br> "Well, for instance, the clerks employed in my office. I think they may perhaps club together and give us a handsome wedding-present if we send them cards. And if they do, I suppose their wives will feel privileged to call."
<br> 
<br> "And their wives are 'undesirable?' Yes, I suppose I see what you mean. How awfully narrow our lives are, aren't they? I imagine it might be a very broadening and interesting experience to really make friends with other classes than our own. I've never had the shadow of a chance to."
<br> 
<br> Daniel's glow of pride in realizing that he was marrying a woman whose aristocratic ignorance of other classes than her own was so absolute as to make her suppose na?vely that it might be "broadening and interesting" to know such, quite counteracted the disturbing effect of this absurd suggestion. He had only to remember his sisters' long struggle for recognition and their present precarious foothold in New Munich "society" to appreciate to the full the (to him) wonderful fact that his wife and all her "kin," as they called their relatives, "could have it to say" they had always been "at the top."
<br> 
<br> That such a wife might find his sisters "undesirable" did not occur to him, his sense of his sisters' crudities being dulled by familiarity with them, and his standard of value being so largely a financial one.
<br> 
<br> "When folks call on you in New Munich, Margaret," said Daniel, "Jennie and Sadie will be a great help to you in telling you whom of your callers you must cultivate and whom you must not."
<br> 
<br> "But aside from your employees and their wives there would be only your family's friends, of course?" Margaret asked, again puzzled.
<br> 
<br> "Well, some people prominent in our church, but not in society, and a few others, may bother us some. You need not worry about it; Jennie and Sadie will separate the sheep from the goats for you," he smiled.
<br> 
<br> "You have told me so little of your people. Your sisters live in New Munich?"
<br> 
<br> "I ought to have mentioned before this, dear, that my sisters keep house for me. They will continue to live with me."
<br> 
<br> "Oh!" Margaret's heart bounded with a great relief at this information, though even to her own secret consciousness it seemed disloyal to rejoice that she was not going to be thrown alone upon the society of Daniel Leitzel; the prospect had already begun to seem rather appalling.
<br> 
<br> "No use in our setting up a separate establishment," continued Daniel; "it's so much cheaper for us all to live together, my sisters being such excellent managers."
<br> 
<br> Margaret, not gathering from this that his sisters shared with him the expense of the "establishment," but concluding, rather, that they were dependent upon him, hastened to assure him that she would not wish him, on her account, to assume the support of two households.
<br> 
<br> "To tell you the truth, Margaret, I shouldn't know how to get on without Jennie and Sadie, they understand me and all my little habits so well, and they do take such care of my comforts, which is a great thing to a man who constantly uses his brain so strenuously as I do."
<br> 
<br> Again Margaret inwardly congratulated herself that it would not devolve upon her to take care of his comforts and learn all his "little habits," which occupation appeared to her a pitiable waste of a woman's life—in the case of any but a great man.
<br> 
<br> "When I did it for Uncle Osmond," she reflected, "it seemed worth while because of what he was giving to the world almost up to the day of his death."
<br> 
<br> "The work of a corporation lawyer," she asked Daniel, "is it anything more than a money-making job?"
<br> 
<br> "Anything more?" repeated Daniel, shocked at the suggestion that it could be anything more. "Isn't that enough?"
<br> 
<br> "Dear me, no! When two women spend their lives keeping a man fit for his work, they surely want to know that his work is worth such a price; that it is benefiting society."
<br> 
<br> "Well, of course, any money-making 'job,' as you call it (I would hardly call my legal work a 'job') must benefit society; if I make money, I not only can support a family but can give to public charities, and to the church."
<br> 
<br> "There's nothing in that, Daniel; I have studied enough social and political economy to know, as you, too, certainly must know, that society has outgrown the philanthropy and charity idea; has learned to hate philanthropy and charity; people are demanding the right to earn their own way and keep their self-respect."
<br> 
<br> "I'm afraid, Margaret," said Daniel gravely, "your irreligious uncle gave you some rather unladylike ideas. However," he smiled, "my Christian influence on you, as fond of me as you are, will soon make you forget his infidel teachings. For goodness' sake, dear, don't forget yourself and repeat such atheistic thoughts before my sisters or indeed to any one in New Munich. Our best society is very critical."
<br> 
<br> It flashed upon Margaret to wonder, with a sudden sense of despair, what her uncle would have said to her marrying Daniel Leitzel.
<br> 
<br> "If I don't do it quickly, I can't hold out!" she miserably thought.
<br> 
<br> But she realized that she confronted a worse fate in the alternative of remaining with Hattie.
<br> 
<br> "How old are your sisters?" she asked.
<br> 
<br> "They are both elderly women, though as vigorous as they ever were."
<br> 
<br> Margaret told herself that she would be so much kinder to them than Hattie had ever been to her. "They shall never feel unwelcome in my home," she resolved.
<br> 
<br> "Are they your only relatives in New Munich?" she inquired.
<br> 
<br> "In New Munich, yes. But Hiram lives in Millerstown nearby."
<br> 
<br> "Your parents are not living?"
<br> 
<br> "My mother—no, my parents are not living."
<br> 
<br> "You seem not quite sure," she smiled.
<br> 
<br> Daniel coloured uncomfortably. The thought of his Mennonite step-mother gave him his first humiliating sense of inferiority to a Berkeley of Berkeley Hill. What a shock it would be to "a perfect lady" like Margaret if she ever met the old woman! He would try to avert such a stab to his self-respect.
<br> 
<br> "I suppose," he thought with some bitterness, "I can't get out of telling her about mother; she's bound to hear of her some time, and even perhaps meet her."
<br> 
<br> "I have a step-mother," he said testily.
<br> 
<br> "She lives in New Munich?"
<br> 
<br> "No, fifteen miles out in the country. We don't see much of her."
<br> 
<br> "I don't see her name here," said Margaret, glancing down the list he had given her.
<br> 
<br> "No; it won't be necessary to send her a card."
<br> 
<br> "You are not friendly with her? She was not a good step-mother to you?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, yes; no one could be unfriendly with her—that is, she's an inoffensive, good-hearted old woman. But—well, we see very little of her; she's not a blood-relative, you know."
<br> 
<br> "But surely, if you are not at daggers' points with her, you would send your father's widow an announcement of your wedding!"
<br> 
<br> "But—we don't think very much of her, Margaret; we're not, just to say, intimate with her."
<br> 
<br> "You say, though, that she is 'inoffensive and good-hearted,' and she was your father's wife?" repeated Margaret, looking mystified.
<br> 
<br> "Oh, well," Daniel gave in, "I'll add her name if you think I—I ought to. She'll be so pleased; she'll tell it all over the township! I mean"—he pulled himself up—"well, you see, she's old and no use to any one and I'm afraid she's going to be, after a while, something of a burden to us all."
<br> 
<br> Margaret remained silent, as Daniel took a pencil from his vest-pocket and scribbled at the end of his wedding list.
<br> 
<br> "There," he said, handing the paper back to her. "Anything to please you, my dear!"
<br> 
<br> "Daniel?"
<br> 
<br> "Well, dearest?"
<br> 
<br> "I don't like the way you speak of that old lady."
<br> 
<br> "But haven't I consented to send cards to her, Margaret?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes. And I'm sure that a man who loves children as you do, who gives money to charities and the church, as you tell me you do, couldn't be thoughtless of the aged. I don't want to believe you could."
<br> 
<br> "No, indeed! I gave one hundred dollars last year to our U. B. Church Home for Old Ladies." He drew out his purse, extracted a newspaper clipping, and passed it to her, "My name heads the list, you see."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, Daniel, and you were going to neglect to send an announcement of your wedding to the 'aged, inoffensive, kind-hearted, but useless and burdensome' widow of your father!"
<br> 
<br> "But, Margaret," he protested, his self-esteem wincing at her disapproval, "if ever you see her, you'll not blame me! You'll understand. Anyway, family sentiment among you Southerners is so much stronger, I've always been told, than with us in the North."
<br> 
<br> "I'm sure it must be."
<br> 
<br> "My step-mother is too poor, too, to send us a wedding present," he added as a mitigating reason for his "neglect."
<br> 
<br> Margaret, having no conception of his penuriousness (he seemed so lavishly generous to her), took such speeches as this for a childish simplicity, the eccentricity of legal genius, perhaps. Had she known that he actually felt it wasteful to invest an expensively engraved card and a stamp where there would be no return of any kind, she would have advised him to consult an alienist.
<br> 
<br> Little did she and Daniel dream that the sending of that wedding announcement to old Mrs. Leitzel of Martz Township was going to make history for the entire Leitzel family.
