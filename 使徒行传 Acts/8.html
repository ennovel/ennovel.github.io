<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Saul gave approval to his death. Now at that time a violent attack was started against the church in Jerusalem; and all but the Apostles went away into all parts of Judaea and Samaria.
<br>8:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 虔 诚 的 人 ， 把 司 提 反 埋 葬 了 ， 为 他 捶 胸 大 哭 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And God-fearing men put Stephen's body in its last resting-place, making great weeping over him.
<br>8:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;扫 罗 却 残 害 教 会 ， 进 各 人 的 家 ， 拉 着 男 女 下 在 监 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Saul was burning with hate against the church, going into every house and taking men and women and putting them in prison.
<br>8:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 些 分 散 的 人 ， 往 各 处 去 传 道 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But those who had gone in flight went everywhere preaching the word.
<br>8:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;腓 利 下 撒 玛 利 亚 城 去 ， 宣 讲 基 督 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Philip went down to Samaria and was teaching them about Christ.
<br>8:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 听 见 了 ， 又 看 见 腓 利 所 行 的 神 迹 ， 就 同 心 合 意 地 听 从 他 的 话 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And all the people gave attention to the words which Philip said, when they saw the signs which he did.
<br>8:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 有 许 多 人 被 污 鬼 附 着 ， 那 些 鬼 大 声 呼 叫 ， 从 他 们 身 上 出 来 。 还 有 许 多 瘫 痪 的 ， 瘸 腿 的 ， 都 得 了 医 治 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For unclean spirits came out from those who had them, crying with a loud voice; and a number of those who were ill and broken in body were made well.
<br>8:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 那 城 里 ， 就 大 有 欢 喜 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there was great joy in that city.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And there was much joy in that town.
<br>8:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 一 个 人 ， 名 叫 西 门 ， 向 来 在 那 城 里 行 邪 术 ， 妄 自 尊 大 ， 使 撒 玛 利 亚 的 百 姓 惊 奇 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But there was a certain man named Simon, who in the past had been a wonder-worker and a cause of surprise to the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was a great man:
<br>8:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;无 论 大 小 ， 都 听 从 他 ， 说 ， 这 人 就 是 那 称 为 神 的 大 能 者 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;To whom they all gave attention, from the smallest to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God which is named Great.
<br>8:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 听 从 他 ， 因 他 久 用 邪 术 ， 使 他 们 惊 奇 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they gave attention to him, because for a long time his wonder-working powers had kept them under his control.
<br>8:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;及 至 他 们 信 了 腓 利 所 传 神 国 的 福 音 ， 和 耶 稣 基 督 的 名 ， 连 男 带 女 就 受 了 洗 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But when they had faith in the good news given by Philip about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, a number of men and women had baptism.
<br>8:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;西 门 自 己 也 信 了 。 既 受 了 洗 ， 就 常 与 腓 利 在 一 处 。 看 见 他 所 行 的 神 迹 和 大 异 能 ， 就 甚 惊 奇 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Simon himself had faith and, having had baptism, he went with Philip and, seeing the signs and the great wonders which he did, he was full of surprise.
<br>8:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;使 徒 在 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 听 见 撒 玛 利 亚 人 领 受 了 神 的 道 ， 就 打 发 彼 得 约 翰 往 他 们 那 里 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now when the Apostles at Jerusalem had news that the people of Samaria had taken the word of God into their hearts, they sent to them Peter and John;
<br>8:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;两 个 人 到 了 ， 就 为 他 们 祷 告 ， 要 叫 他 们 受 圣 灵 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Who, when they came there, made prayer for them, that the Holy Spirit might be given to them:
<br>8:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 圣 灵 还 没 有 降 在 他 们 一 个 人 身 上 。 他 们 只 奉 主 耶 稣 的 名 受 了 洗 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For up to that time he had not come on any of them; only baptism had been given to them in the name of the Lord Jesus.
<br>8:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 使 徒 按 手 在 他 们 头 上 ， 他 们 就 受 了 圣 灵 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then they put their hands on them, and the Holy Spirit came on them.
<br>8:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;西 门 看 见 使 徒 按 手 ， 便 有 圣 灵 赐 下 。 就 拿 钱 给 使 徒 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the touch of the Apostles' hands, he made them an offering of money, saying,
<br>8:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;说 ， 把 这 权 柄 也 给 我 ， 叫 我 手 按 着 谁 。 谁 就 可 以 受 圣 灵 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Give me this power, so that when I put my hands on anyone he may get the Holy Spirit.
<br>8:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 说 ， 你 的 银 子 ， 和 你 一 同 灭 亡 吧 。 因 你 想 神 的 恩 赐 ， 是 可 以 用 钱 买 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Peter said, May your money come to destruction with you, because you had the idea that what is freely given by God may be got for a price.
<br>8:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 在 这 道 上 ， 无 分 无 关 。 因 为 在 神 面 前 ， 你 的 心 不 正 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;You have no part in this business, because your heart is not right before God.
<br>8:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 当 懊 悔 你 这 罪 恶 ， 祈 求 主 。 或 者 你 心 里 的 意 念 可 得 赦 免 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Let your heart be changed, and make prayer to God that you may have forgiveness for your evil thoughts.
<br>8:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 看 出 你 正 在 苦 胆 之 中 ， 被 罪 恶 捆 绑 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For I see that you are prisoned in bitter envy and the chains of sin.
<br>8:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;西 门 说 ， 愿 你 们 为 我 求 主 ， 叫 你 们 所 说 的 ， 没 有 一 样 临 到 我 身 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Simon, answering, said, Make prayer for me to the Lord, so that these things which you have said may not come on me.
<br>8:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;使 徒 既 证 明 主 道 ， 而 且 传 讲 ， 就 回 耶 路 撒 冷 去 ， 一 路 在 撒 玛 利 亚 好 些 村 庄 传 扬 福 音 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So they, having given their witness and made clear the word of the Lord, went back to Jerusalem, giving the good news on their way in a number of the small towns of Samaria.
<br>8:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 主 的 一 个 使 者 对 腓 利 说 ， 起 来 ， 向 南 走 ， 往 那 从 耶 路 撒 冷 下 迦 萨 的 路 上 去 。 那 路 是 旷 野 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But an angel of the Lord said to Philip, Get up, and go to the south, to the road which goes from Jerusalem to Gaza, through the waste land.
<br>8:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;腓 利 就 起 身 去 了 。 不 料 ， 有 一 个 埃 提 阿 伯 （ 即 古 实 ， 见 以 赛 亚 十 八 章 一 节 ） 人 ， 是 个 有 大 权 的 太 监 ， 在 埃 提 阿 伯 女 王 干 大 基 的 手 下 总 管 银 库 ， 他 上 耶 路 撒 冷 礼 拜 去 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he went and there was a man of Ethiopia, a servant of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, and controller of all her property, who had come up to Jerusalem for worship;
<br>8:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;现 在 回 来 ， 在 车 上 坐 着 ， 念 先 知 以 赛 亚 的 书 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He was going back, seated in his carriage, and was reading the book of the prophet Isaiah.
<br>8:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;圣 灵 对 腓 利 说 ， 你 去 贴 近 那 车 走 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the Spirit said to Philip, Go near, and get on his carriage.
<br>8:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;腓 利 就 跑 到 太 监 那 里 ， 听 见 他 念 先 知 以 赛 亚 的 书 ， 便 问 他 说 ， 你 所 念 的 ， 你 明 白 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Philip, running up to him, saw that he was reading Isaiah the prophet, and said to him, Is the sense of what you are reading clear to you?
<br>8:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 说 ， 没 有 人 指 教 我 ， 怎 能 明 白 呢 ？ 于 是 请 腓 利 上 车 ， 与 他 同 坐 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said, How is that possible when I have no guide? And he made Philip get up by his side.
<br>8:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 所 念 的 那 段 经 ， 说 ， 他 像 羊 被 牵 到 宰 杀 之 地 ， 又 像 羊 羔 在 剪 毛 的 人 手 下 无 声 ， 他 也 是 这 样 不 开 口 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now the place in the book where he was reading was this: He was taken, like a sheep, to be put to death; and as a lamb is quiet when its wool is being cut, so he made no sound:
<br>8:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 卑 微 的 时 候 ， 人 不 按 公 义 审 判 他 。 （ 原 文 作 他 的 审 判 被 夺 去 ） 谁 能 述 说 他 的 世 代 ， 因 为 他 的 生 命 从 地 上 夺 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Being of low degree, his cause was not given a hearing: who has knowledge of his family? for his life is cut off from the earth.
<br>8:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;太 监 对 腓 利 说 ， 请 问 先 知 说 这 话 ， 是 指 着 谁 ， 是 指 着 自 己 呢 ？ 是 指 着 别 人 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the Ethiopian said to Philip, About whom are these words said by the prophet? about himself, or some other?
<br>8:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;腓 利 就 开 口 从 这 经 上 起 ， 对 他 传 讲 耶 稣
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So Philip, starting from this writing, gave him the good news about Jesus.
<br>8:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;二 人 正 往 前 走 ， 到 了 有 水 的 地 方 ， 太 监 说 ， 看 哪 ， 这 里 有 水 ， 我 受 洗 有 什 么 妨 碍 呢 ？ （ 有 古 卷 在 此 有
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And while they were going on their way, they came to some water, and the Ethiopian said, See, here is water; why may I not have baptism?
<br>8:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;腓 利 说 ， 你 若 是 一 心 相 信 就 可 以 ， 他 回 答 说 ， 我 信 耶 稣 基 督 是 神 的 儿 子 ）
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;[]
<br>8:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 吩 咐 车 站 住 ， 腓 利 和 太 监 二 人 同 下 水 里 去 ， 腓 利 就 给 他 施 洗 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he gave orders for the carriage to be stopped, and the two of them went down into the water, and Philip gave him baptism.
<br>8:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;从 水 里 上 来 ， 主 的 灵 把 腓 利 提 了 去 ， 太 监 也 不 再 见 他 了 ， 就 欢 欢 喜 喜 地 走 路 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away; and the Ethiopian saw him no more, for he went on his way full of joy.
<br>8:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;后 来 有 人 在 亚 锁 都 遇 见 腓 利 ， 他 走 遍 那 地 方 ， 在 各 城 宣 传 福 音 ， 直 到 该 撒 利 亚 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Philip came to Azotus, and went through all the towns, preaching the good news, till he came to Caesarea.
