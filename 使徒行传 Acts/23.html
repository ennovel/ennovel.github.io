<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Paul, looking fixedly at the Sanhedrin, said, My brothers, my life has been upright before God till this day.
<br>23:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;大 祭 司 亚 拿 尼 亚 ， 就 吩 咐 旁 边 站 着 的 人 打 他 的 嘴 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the high priest, Ananias, gave orders to those who were near him to give him a blow on the mouth.
<br>23:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;保 罗 对 他 说 ， 你 这 粉 饰 的 墙 。 神 要 打 你 。 你 坐 堂 为 的 是 按 律 法 审 问 我 ， 你 竟 违 背 律 法 ， 吩 咐 人 打 我 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Paul said to him, God will give blows to you, you whitewashed wall: are you here to be my judge by law, and by your orders am I given blows against the law?
<br>23:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;站 在 旁 边 的 人 说 ， 你 辱 骂 神 的 大 祭 司 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And those who were near said, Do you say such words against God's high priest?
<br>23:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;保 罗 说 ， 弟 兄 们 ， 我 不 晓 得 他 是 大 祭 司 。 经 上 记 着 说 ， 不 可 毁 谤 你 百 姓 的 官 长 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Paul said, Brother, I had no idea that he was the high priest: for it has been said, You may not say evil about the ruler of your people.
<br>23:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;保 罗 看 出 大 众 ， 一 半 是 撒 都 该 人 ， 一 半 是 法 利 赛 人 ， 就 在 公 会 中 大 声 说 ， 弟 兄 们 ， 我 是 法 利 赛 人 ， 也 是 法 利 赛 人 的 子 孙 。 我 现 在 受 审 问 ， 是 为 盼 望 死 人 复 活 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But when Paul saw that half of them were Sadducees and the rest Pharisees, he said in the Sanhedrin, Brothers, I am a Pharisee, and the son of Pharisees: I am here to be judged on the question of the hope of the coming back from the dead.
<br>23:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;说 了 这 话 ， 法 利 赛 人 和 撒 都 该 人 ， 就 争 论 起 来 ， 会 众 分 为 两 党 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he had said this, there was an argument between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and a division in the meeting.
<br>23:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 撒 都 该 人 说 ， 没 有 复 活 ， 也 没 有 天 使 ， 和 鬼 魂 ， 法 利 赛 人 却 说 ， 两 样 都 有 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For the Sadducees say that there is no coming back from the dead, and no angels or spirits: but the Pharisees have belief in all these.
<br>23:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 大 大 地 喧 嚷 起 来 。 有 几 个 法 利 赛 党 的 文 士 站 起 来 ， 争 辩 说 ， 我 们 看 不 出 这 人 有 什 么 恶 处 ， 倘 若 有 鬼 魂 ， 或 是 天 使 ， 对 他 说 过 话 ， 怎 么 样 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And there was a great outcry: and some of the scribes on the side of the Pharisees got up and took part in the discussion, saying, We see no evil in this man: what if he has had a revelation from an angel or a spirit?
<br>23:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 时 大 起 争 吵 ， 千 夫 长 恐 怕 保 罗 被 他 们 扯 碎 了 ， 就 吩 咐 兵 丁 下 去 ， 把 他 从 众 人 当 中 抢 出 来 ， 带 进 营 楼 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the argument became very violent, the chief captain, fearing that Paul would be pulled in two by them, gave orders to the armed men to take him by force from among them, and take him into the army building.
<br>23:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;当 夜 ， 主 站 在 保 罗 旁 边 说 ， 放 心 吧 ， 你 怎 样 在 耶 路 撒 冷 为 我 作 见 证 ， 也 必 怎 样 在 罗 马 为 我 作 见 证 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the night after, the Lord came to his side and said, Be of good heart, for as you have been witnessing for me in Jerusalem, so will you be my witness in Rome.
<br>23:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;到 了 天 亮 ， 犹 太 人 同 谋 起 誓 ， 说 ， 若 不 先 杀 保 罗 ， 就 不 吃 不 喝 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when it was day, the Jews came together and put themselves under an oath that they would take no food or drink till they had put Paul to death.
<br>23:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 样 同 心 起 誓 的 ， 有 四 十 多 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And more than forty of them took this oath.
<br>23:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 来 见 祭 司 长 和 长 老 说 ， 我 们 已 经 起 了 一 个 大 誓 ， 若 不 先 杀 保 罗 ， 就 不 吃 什 么 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they came to the chief priests and the rulers and said, We have taken a great oath to take no food till we have put Paul to death
<br>23:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;现 在 你 们 和 公 会 要 知 会 千 夫 长 ， 叫 他 带 下 保 罗 到 你 们 这 里 来 ， 假 作 要 详 细 察 考 他 的 事 。 我 们 已 经 预 备 好 了 ， 不 等 他 来 到 跟 前 就 杀 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So now, will you and the Sanhedrin make a request to the military authorities to have him sent down to you, as if you were desiring to go into the business in greater detail; and we, before ever he gets to you, will be waiting to put him to death.
<br>23:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;保 罗 的 外 甥 ， 听 见 他 们 设 下 埋 伏 ， 就 来 到 营 楼 里 告 诉 保 罗 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Paul's sister's son had word of their design, and he came into the army building and gave news of it to Paul.
<br>23:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;保 罗 请 一 个 百 夫 长 来 ， 说 ， 你 领 这 少 年 人 去 见 千 夫 长 ， 他 有 事 告 诉 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Paul sent for a captain and said, Take this young man to your chief, for he has news for him.
<br>23:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 把 他 领 去 见 千 夫 长 说 ， 被 囚 的 保 罗 请 我 到 他 那 里 ， 求 我 领 这 少 年 人 来 见 你 。 他 有 事 告 诉 你 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So he took him to the chief captain and said, Paul, the prisoner, made a request to me to take this young man to you, for he has something to say to you.
<br>23:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;千 夫 长 就 拉 着 他 的 手 ， 走 到 一 旁 ， 私 下 问 他 说 ， 你 有 什 么 事 告 诉 我 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the chief took him by the hand and, going on one side, said to him privately, What is it you have to say to me?
<br>23:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 说 ， 犹 太 人 已 经 约 定 ， 要 求 你 明 天 带 下 保 罗 到 公 会 里 去 ， 假 作 要 详 细 查 问 他 的 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said, The Jews are in agreement together to make a request to you for Paul to be taken, on the day after this, into the Sanhedrin, to be questioned in greater detail.
<br>23:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 切 不 要 随 从 他 们 ， 因 为 他 们 有 四 十 多 人 埋 伏 ， 已 经 起 誓 ， 说 ， 若 不 先 杀 保 罗 ， 就 不 吃 不 喝 。 现 在 预 备 好 了 ， 只 等 你 应 允 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But do not give way to them, for more than forty of them are waiting for him, having taken an oath not to take food or drink till they have put him to death: and now they are ready, waiting for your order.
<br>23:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 千 夫 长 打 发 少 年 人 走 ， 嘱 咐 他 说 ， 不 要 告 诉 人 你 将 这 事 报 给 我 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So the chief captain let the young man go, saying to him, Do not say to anyone that you have given me word of these things.
<br>23:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;千 夫 长 便 叫 了 两 个 百 夫 长 来 ， 说 ， 预 备 步 兵 二 百 ， 马 兵 七 十 ， 长 枪 手 二 百 ， 今 夜 亥 初 往 该 撒 利 亚 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he sent for two captains and said, Make ready two hundred men, with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, to go to Caesarea, at the third hour of the night:
<br>23:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;也 要 预 备 牲 口 叫 保 罗 骑 上 ， 护 送 到 巡 抚 腓 力 斯 那 里 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And get beasts so that they may put Paul on them, and take him safely to Felix, the ruler.
<br>23:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;千 夫 长 又 写 了 文 书 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he wrote a letter after this manner:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he sent a letter in these words:
<br>23:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;大 略 说 ， 革 老 丢 吕 西 亚 ， 请 巡 抚 腓 力 斯 大 人 安 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Claudius Lysias, to the most noble ruler, Felix, peace be with you.
<br>23:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 人 被 犹 太 人 拿 住 ， 将 要 杀 害 ， 我 得 知 他 是 罗 马 人 ， 就 带 兵 丁 下 去 救 他 出 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;This man was taken by the Jews, and was about to be put to death by them, when I came on them with the army and took him out of danger, having knowledge that he was a Roman.
<br>23:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 要 知 道 他 们 告 他 的 缘 故 ， 我 就 带 他 下 到 他 们 的 公 会 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And, desiring to get at the reason for their attack on him, I took him down to their Sanhedrin:
<br>23:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;便 查 知 他 被 告 ， 是 因 他 们 律 法 的 辩 论 ， 并 没 有 什 么 该 死 该 绑 的 罪 名 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then it became clear to me that it was a question of their law, and that nothing was said against him which might be a reason for prison or death.
<br>23:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;后 来 有 人 把 要 害 他 的 计 谋 告 诉 我 ， 我 就 立 时 解 他 到 你 那 里 去 ， 又 吩 咐 告 他 的 人 ， 在 你 面 前 告 他 。 （ 有 古 卷 在 此 有 愿 你 平 安 ）
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when news was given to me that a secret design was being made against the man, I sent him straight away to you, giving orders to those who are against him to make their statements before you.
<br>23:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 兵 丁 照 所 吩 咐 他 们 的 ， 将 保 罗 夜 里 带 到 安 提 帕 底 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So the armed men, as they were ordered, took Paul and came by night to Antipatris.
<br>23:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;第 二 天 ， 让 马 兵 护 送 ， 他 们 就 回 营 楼 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But on the day after, they sent the horsemen on with him, and went back to their place:
<br>23:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;马 兵 来 到 该 撒 利 亚 ， 把 文 书 呈 给 巡 抚 ， 便 叫 保 罗 站 在 他 面 前 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they, when they came to Caesarea, gave the letter to the ruler, and took Paul before him.
<br>23:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;巡 抚 看 了 文 书 ， 问 保 罗 是 那 省 的 人 ， 既 晓 得 他 是 基 利 家 人 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And after reading it, he said, What part of the country do you come from? And, hearing that he was from Cilicia,
<br>23:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 说 ， 等 告 你 的 人 来 到 ， 我 要 细 听 你 的 事 ， 便 吩 咐 人 把 他 看 守 在 希 律 的 衙 门 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;I will give hearing to your cause, he said, when those who are against you have come. And he gave orders for him to be kept in Herod's Praetorium.
