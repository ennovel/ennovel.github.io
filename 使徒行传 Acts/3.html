<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now Peter and John were going up to the Temple at the ninth hour, the hour of prayer;
<br>3:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 一 个 人 ， 生 来 是 瘸 腿 的 ， 天 天 被 人 抬 来 ， 放 在 殿 的 一 个 门 口 ， 那 门 名 叫 美 门 ， 要 求 进 殿 的 人 周 济 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And a certain man who from birth had had no power in his legs, was taken there every day, and put down at the door of the Temple which is named Beautiful, requesting money from those who went into the Temple;
<br>3:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 看 见 彼 得 约 翰 将 要 进 殿 ， 就 求 他 们 周 济 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He then, seeing Peter and John going into the Temple, made a request to them.
<br>3:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 约 翰 定 睛 看 他 。 彼 得 说 ， 你 看 我 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Peter, looking at him, with John, said, Keep your eyes on us.
<br>3:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 人 就 留 意 看 他 们 ， 指 望 得 着 什 么 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he gave attention to them, hoping to get something from them.
<br>3:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 说 ， 金 银 我 都 没 有 ， 只 把 我 所 有 的 给 你 ， 我 奉 拿 撒 勒 人 耶 稣 基 督 的 名 ， 叫 你 起 来 行 走 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Peter said, I have no silver or gold, but what I have, that I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up on your feet.
<br>3:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 拉 着 他 的 右 手 ， 扶 他 起 来 ， 他 的 脚 和 踝 子 骨 ， 立 刻 健 壮 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he took him by his right hand, lifting him up; and straight away his feet and the bones of his legs became strong,
<br>3:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 跳 起 来 ， 站 着 ， 又 行 走 。 同 他 们 进 了 殿 ， 走 着 ， 跳 着 ， 赞 美 神 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And, jumping up, he got on to his feet and went into the Temple with them, walking and jumping and giving praise to God.
<br>3:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;百 姓 都 看 见 他 行 走 ， 赞 美 神 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And all the people saw him walking and praising God:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And all the people saw him walking and praising God:
<br>3:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;认 得 他 是 那 素 常 坐 在 殿 的 美 门 口 求 周 济 的 ， 就 因 他 所 遇 着 的 事 ， 满 心 希 奇 惊 讶 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they saw that it was the man who made requests for money at the door of the Temple, and they were full of wonder and surprise at what had taken place.
<br>3:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 人 正 在 称 为 所 罗 门 的 廊 下 ， 拉 着 彼 得 ， 约 翰 。 众 百 姓 一 齐 跑 到 他 们 那 里 ， 很 觉 希 奇 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And while he kept his hands on Peter and John, all the people came running together to the covered way which is named Solomon's, full of wonder.
<br>3:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 看 见 ， 就 对 百 姓 说 ， 以 色 列 人 哪 ， 为 什 么 把 这 事 当 作 希 奇 呢 ？ 为 什 么 定 睛 看 我 们 ， 以 为 我 们 凭 自 己 的 能 力 和 虔 诚 ， 使 这 人 行 走 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when Peter saw it he said to the people, You men of Israel, why are you so greatly surprised at this man? or why are you looking at us as if by our power or virtue we had given him the use of his legs?
<br>3:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;亚 伯 拉 罕 ， 以 撒 ， 雅 各 的 神 ， 就 是 我 们 列 祖 的 神 ， 已 经 荣 耀 了 他 的 仆 人 耶 稣 。 （ 仆 人 或 作 儿 子 ） 你 们 却 把 他 交 付 彼 拉 多 。 彼 拉 多 定 意 要 释 放 他 ， 你 们 竟 在 彼 拉 多 面 前 弃 绝 了 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has given glory to his servant Jesus; whom you gave up, turning your backs on him, when Pilate had made the decision to let him go free.
<br>3:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 弃 绝 了 那 圣 洁 公 义 者 ， 反 求 着 释 放 一 个 凶 手 给 你 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But you would have nothing to do with the Holy and Upright One, and made request for a man of blood to be given to you,
<br>3:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 杀 了 那 生 命 的 主 ， 神 却 叫 他 从 死 里 复 活 了 。 我 们 都 是 为 这 事 作 见 证 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And put to death the Lord of life; whom God gave back from the dead; of which fact we are witnesses.
<br>3:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 们 因 信 他 的 名 ， 他 的 名 便 叫 你 们 所 看 见 所 认 识 的 这 人 ， 健 壮 了 。 正 是 他 所 赐 的 信 心 ， 叫 这 人 在 你 们 众 人 面 前 全 然 好 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And his name, through faith in his name, has made this man strong, whom you see and have knowledge of: yes, the faith which is through him has made him well, before you all.
<br>3:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;弟 兄 们 ， 我 晓 得 你 们 作 这 事 ， 是 出 于 不 知 ， 你 们 的 官 长 也 是 如 此 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And now, my brothers, I am conscious that you did this, as did your rulers, without knowledge.
<br>3:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 神 曾 借 众 先 知 的 口 ， 预 言 基 督 将 要 受 害 ， 就 这 样 应 验 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But the things which God had made clear before, by the mouth of all the prophets, that the Christ would have to undergo, he has put into effect in this way.
<br>3:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;所 以 你 们 当 悔 改 归 正 ， 使 你 们 的 罪 得 以 涂 抹 ， 这 样 ， 那 安 舒 的 日 子 ， 就 必 从 主 面 前 来 到 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So then, let your hearts be changed and be turned to God, so that your sins may be completely taken away, and times of blessing may come from the Lord;
<br>3:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;主 也 必 差 遣 所 预 定 给 你 们 的 基 督 耶 稣 降 临 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And that he may send the Christ who was marked out for you from the first, even Jesus:
<br>3:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;天 必 留 他 ， 等 到 万 物 复 兴 的 时 候 ， 就 是 神 从 创 世 以 来 ， 借 着 圣 先 知 的 口 所 说 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Who is to be kept in heaven till the time when all things are put right, of which God has given word by the mouth of his holy prophets, who have been from the earliest times.
<br>3:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;摩 西 曾 说 ， 主 神 要 从 你 们 弟 兄 中 间 ， 给 你 们 兴 起 一 位 先 知 像 我 ， 凡 他 向 你 们 所 说 的 ， 你 们 都 要 听 从 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For Moses said, The Lord will give you a prophet from among your people, like me; you will give ear to everything which he will say to you.
<br>3:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;凡 不 听 从 那 先 知 的 ， 必 要 从 民 中 全 然 灭 绝 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And every soul who does not give attention to that prophet, will be cut off from among the people.
<br>3:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;从 撒 母 耳 以 来 的 众 先 知 ， 凡 说 预 言 的 ， 也 都 说 到 这 些 日 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And all the prophets from Samuel and those who came after, every one of them, gave word of these days.
<br>3:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 是 先 知 的 子 孙 ， 也 承 受 神 与 你 们 祖 宗 所 立 的 约 ， 就 是 对 亚 伯 拉 罕 说 ， 地 上 万 族 ， 都 要 因 你 的 后 裔 得 福 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;You are the sons of the prophets, and of the agreement which God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, Through your seed a blessing will come on all the families of the earth.
<br>3:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;神 既 兴 起 他 的 仆 人 ， （ 或 作 儿 子 ） 就 先 差 他 到 你 们 这 里 来 ， 赐 福 给 你 们 ， 叫 你 们 各 人 回 转 ， 离 开 罪 恶 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;To you, first, God sent his servant, blessing you by turning every one of you from his sins.
