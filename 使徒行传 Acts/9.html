<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Saul, still burning with desire to put to death the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,
<br>9:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;求 文 书 给 大 马 色 的 各 会 堂 ， 若 是 找 着 信 奉 这 道 的 人 ， 无 论 男 女 ， 都 准 他 捆 绑 带 到 耶 路 撒 冷 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And made a request for letters from him to the Synagogues of Damascus, so that if there were any of the Way there, men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem.
<br>9:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;扫 罗 行 路 ， 将 到 大 马 色 ， 忽 然 从 天 上 发 光 ， 四 面 照 着 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And while he was journeying, he came near Damascus; and suddenly he saw a light from heaven shining round him;
<br>9:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 就 仆 倒 在 地 ， 听 见 有 声 音 对 他 说 ， 扫 罗 ， 扫 罗 ， 你 为 什 么 逼 迫 我 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he went down on the earth, and a voice said to him, Saul, Saul, why are you attacking me so cruelly?
<br>9:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 说 ， 主 阿 ， 你 是 谁 。 主 说 ， 我 就 是 你 所 逼 迫 的 耶 稣 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said, Who are you, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus, whom you are attacking:
<br>9:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;起 来 ， 进 城 去 ， 你 所 当 作 的 事 ， 必 有 人 告 诉 你 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But get up, and go into the town, and it will be made clear to you what you have to do.
<br>9:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;同 行 的 人 ， 站 在 那 里 ， 说 不 出 话 来 ， 听 见 声 音 ， 却 看 不 见 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the men who were with him were not able to say anything; hearing the voice, but seeing no one.
<br>9:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;扫 罗 从 地 上 起 来 ， 睁 开 眼 睛 ， 竟 不 能 看 见 什 么 。 有 人 拉 他 的 手 ， 领 他 进 了 大 马 色 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Saul got up from the earth, and when his eyes were open, he saw nothing; and he was guided by the hand into Damascus.
<br>9:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;三 日 不 能 看 见 ， 也 不 吃 ， 也 不 喝 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And for three days he was not able to see, and he took no food or drink.
<br>9:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;当 下 在 大 马 色 ， 有 一 个 门 徒 ， 名 叫 亚 拿 尼 亚 。 主 在 异 象 中 对 他 说 ， 亚 拿 尼 亚 。 他 说 ， 主 ， 我 在 这 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias! and he said, Here I am, Lord.
<br>9:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;主 对 他 说 ， 起 来 ， 往 直 街 去 ， 在 犹 大 的 家 里 ， 访 问 一 个 大 数 人 名 叫 扫 罗 。 他 正 祷 告 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the Lord said to him, Get up, and go to the street which is named Straight, and make search at the house of Judas for one named Saul of Tarsus: for he is at prayer;
<br>9:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 看 见 了 一 个 人 ， 名 叫 亚 拿 尼 亚 ， 进 来 按 手 在 他 身 上 ， 叫 他 能 看 见 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and putting his hands on him, so that he may be able to see.
<br>9:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;亚 拿 尼 亚 回 答 说 ， 主 阿 ， 我 听 见 许 多 人 说 ， 这 人 怎 样 在 耶 路 撒 冷 多 多 苦 害 你 的 圣 徒 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Ananias said, Lord, I have had accounts of this man from a number of people, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem:
<br>9:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;并 且 他 在 这 里 有 从 祭 司 长 得 来 的 权 柄 捆 绑 一 切 求 告 你 名 的 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And here he has authority from the chief priests to make prisoners all who give worship to your name.
<br>9:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;主 对 亚 拿 尼 亚 说 ， 你 只 管 去 。 他 是 我 所 拣 选 的 器 皿 ， 要 在 外 邦 人 和 君 王 并 以 色 列 人 面 前 ， 宣 扬 我 的 名 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But the Lord said, Go without fear: for he is a special vessel for me, to give to the Gentiles and kings and to the children of Israel the knowledge of my name:
<br>9:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 也 要 指 示 他 ， 为 我 的 名 必 须 受 许 多 的 苦 难 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For I will make clear to him what troubles he will have to undergo for me.
<br>9:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;亚 拿 尼 亚 就 去 了 ， 进 入 那 家 ， 把 手 按 在 扫 罗 身 上 说 ， 兄 弟 扫 罗 ， 在 你 来 的 路 上 ， 向 你 显 现 的 主 ， 就 是 耶 稣 ， 打 发 我 来 ， 叫 你 能 看 见 ， 又 被 圣 灵 充 满 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Ananias went out and came to the house, and putting his hands on him, said, Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, whom you saw when you were on your journey, has sent me, so that you may be able to see, and be full of the Holy Spirit.
<br>9:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;扫 罗 的 眼 睛 上 ， 好 像 有 鳞 立 刻 掉 下 来 ， 他 就 能 看 见 ， 于 是 起 来 受 了 洗 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And straight away it seemed as if a veil was taken from his eyes, and he was able to see; and he got up, and had baptism;
<br>9:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;吃 过 饭 就 健 壮 了 。 扫 罗 和 大 马 色 的 门 徒 同 住 了 些 日 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he had taken food his strength came back. And for some days he kept with the disciples who were in Damascus.
<br>9:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 在 各 会 堂 里 宣 传 耶 稣 ， 说 他 是 神 的 儿 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And straight away, in the Synagogues, he was preaching Jesus as the Son of God.
<br>9:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;凡 听 见 的 人 ， 都 惊 奇 说 ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 残 害 求 告 这 名 的 ， 不 是 这 人 吗 ？ 并 且 他 到 这 里 来 ， 特 要 捆 绑 他 们 带 到 祭 司 长 那 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And all those hearing him were full of wonder and said, Is not this the man who in Jerusalem was attacking all the worshippers of this name? and he had come here so that he might take them as prisoners before the chief priests.
<br>9:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 扫 罗 越 发 有 能 力 ， 驳 倒 住 大 马 色 的 犹 太 人 ， 证 明 耶 稣 是 基 督 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Saul went on increasing in power, and the Jews in Damascus were not able to give answers to the arguments by which he made it clear that Jesus was the Christ.
<br>9:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;过 了 好 些 日 子 ， 犹 太 人 商 议 要 杀 扫 罗 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then, after some days, the Jews made an agreement together to put him to death:
<br>9:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 他 们 的 计 谋 ， 被 扫 罗 知 道 了 。 他 们 又 昼 夜 在 城 门 守 候 要 杀 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Saul got knowledge of their design. And they kept watch day and night on the roads out of the town, so that they might put him to death:
<br>9:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 的 门 徒 就 在 夜 间 ， 用 筐 子 把 他 从 城 墙 上 缒 下 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But his disciples took him by night and let him down from the wall in a basket.
<br>9:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;扫 罗 到 了 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 想 与 门 徒 结 交 。 他 们 却 都 怕 他 ， 不 信 他 是 门 徒 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he came to Jerusalem, he made an attempt to be joined to the disciples, but they were all in fear of him, not taking him for a disciple.
<br>9:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;惟 有 巴 拿 巴 接 待 他 ， 领 去 见 使 徒 ， 把 他 在 路 上 怎 么 看 见 主 ， 主 怎 么 向 他 说 话 ， 他 在 大 马 色 ， 怎 么 奉 耶 稣 的 名 放 胆 传 道 ， 都 述 说 出 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Barnabas took him to the Apostles and gave them an account of how he had seen the Lord on the road, and had given hearing to his words, and how at Damascus he had been preaching in the name of Jesus without fear.
<br>9:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 扫 罗 在 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 和 门 徒 出 入 来 往 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he was with them, going in and out at Jerusalem,
<br>9:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;奉 主 的 名 ， 放 胆 传 道 。 并 与 说 希 利 尼 话 的 犹 太 人 ， 讲 论 辩 驳 。 他 们 却 想 法 子 要 杀 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Preaching in the name of the Lord without fear; and he had discussions with the Greek Jews; but they were working for his death.
<br>9:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;弟 兄 们 知 道 了 ， 就 送 他 下 该 撒 利 亚 ， 打 发 他 往 大 数 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the brothers had knowledge of it, they took him to Caesarea and sent him to Tarsus.
<br>9:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 时 犹 太 ， 加 利 利 ， 撒 玛 利 亚 ， 各 处 的 教 会 都 得 平 安 ， 被 建 立 。 凡 事 敬 畏 主 ， 蒙 圣 灵 的 安 慰 ， 人 数 就 增 多 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And so the church through all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was made strong; and, living in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, was increased greatly.
<br>9:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 周 流 四 方 的 时 候 ， 也 到 了 居 住 吕 大 的 圣 徒 那 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And it came about that while Peter was going through all parts of the country he came to the saints who were living at Lydda.
<br>9:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;遇 见 一 个 人 ， 名 叫 以 尼 雅 ， 得 了 瘫 痪 ， 在 褥 子 上 躺 卧 八 年 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And there was a certain man there, named Aeneas, who for eight years had been in bed, without power of moving.
<br>9:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 对 他 说 ， 以 尼 雅 ， 耶 稣 基 督 医 好 你 了 。 起 来 收 拾 你 的 褥 子 。 他 就 立 刻 起 来 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ makes you well: get up and make your bed. And straight away he got up.
<br>9:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;凡 住 吕 大 和 沙 仑 的 人 都 看 见 了 他 ， 就 归 服 主 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And all those living in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and were turned to the Lord.
<br>9:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 约 帕 有 一 个 女 徒 ， 名 叫 大 比 大 ， 翻 希 利 尼 话 ， 就 是 多 加 。 （ 多 加 就 是 羚 羊 的 意 思 ） 她 广 行 善 事 ， 多 施 周 济 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, that is, Dorcas: this woman was given to good works and acts of mercy at all times.
<br>9:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;当 时 ， 她 患 病 而 死 。 有 人 把 她 洗 了 。 停 在 楼 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And it came about, in those days, that she got ill and came to her death: and when she had been washed, they put her in a room which was high up.
<br>9:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;吕 大 原 与 约 帕 相 近 。 门 徒 听 见 彼 得 在 那 里 ， 就 打 发 两 个 人 去 见 他 ， 央 求 他 说 ， 快 到 我 们 那 里 去 ， 不 要 耽 延 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And because Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, having knowledge that Peter was there, sent two men to him, requesting him to come to them straight away.
<br>9:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 就 起 身 和 他 们 同 去 。 到 了 ， 便 有 人 领 他 上 楼 。 众 寡 妇 都 站 在 彼 得 旁 边 哭 ， 拿 多 加 与 她 们 同 在 时 ， 所 做 的 里 衣 外 衣 给 他 看 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Peter went with them. And when he had come, they took him into the room: and all the widows were there, weeping and putting before him the coats and clothing which Dorcas had made while she was with them.
<br>9:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 叫 她 们 都 出 去 ， 就 跪 下 祷 告 ， 转 身 对 着 死 人 说 ， 大 比 大 ， 起 来 ， 她 就 睁 开 眼 睛 ， 见 了 彼 得 ， 便 坐 起 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Peter made them all go outside, and went down on his knees in prayer; and turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, get up. And, opening her eyes, she saw Peter and got up.
<br>9:41&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 伸 手 扶 她 起 来 ， 叫 众 圣 徒 和 寡 妇 进 去 ， 把 多 加 活 活 地 交 给 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he took her hand, lifting her up; and, sending for the saints and widows, he gave her to them, living.
<br>9:42&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 事 传 遍 了 约 帕 ， 就 有 许 多 人 信 了 主 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And news of it went all through Joppa, and a number of people had faith in the Lord.
<br>9:43&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;此 后 彼 得 在 约 帕 一 个 硝 皮 匠 西 门 的 家 里 ， 住 了 多 日 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he was living in Joppa for some time with Simon, a leather-worker.
