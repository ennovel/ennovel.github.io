<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the day of Pentecost was come, they were all together in one place.
<br>2:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;忽 然 从 天 上 有 响 声 下 来 ， 好 像 一 阵 大 风 吹 过 ， 充 满 了 他 们 所 坐 的 屋 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like the rushing of a violent wind, and all the house where they were was full of it.
<br>2:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 有 舌 头 如 火 焰 显 现 出 来 ， 分 开 落 在 他 们 各 人 头 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they saw tongues, like flames of fire, coming to rest on every one of them.
<br>2:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 就 都 被 圣 灵 充 满 ， 按 着 圣 灵 所 赐 的 口 才 ， 说 起 别 国 的 话 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they were all full of the Holy Spirit, and were talking in different languages, as the Spirit gave them power.
<br>2:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 时 ， 有 虔 诚 的 犹 太 人 ， 从 天 下 各 国 来 ， 住 在 耶 路 撒 冷 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now there were living at Jerusalem, Jews, God-fearing men, from every nation under heaven.
<br>2:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 声 音 一 响 ， 众 人 都 来 聚 集 ， 各 人 听 见 门 徒 用 众 人 的 乡 谈 说 话 ， 就 甚 纳 闷 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when this sound came to their ears, they all came together, and were greatly surprised because every man was hearing the words of the disciples in his special language.
<br>2:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;都 惊 讶 希 奇 说 ， 看 哪 ， 这 说 话 的 不 都 是 加 利 利 人 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they were full of wonder and said, Are not all these men Galilaeans?
<br>2:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 们 各 人 ， 怎 么 听 见 他 们 说 我 们 生 来 所 用 的 乡 谈 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And how is it that every one of us is hearing their words in the language which was ours from our birth?
<br>2:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 们 帕 提 亚 人 ， 玛 代 人 ， 以 拦 人 ， 和 住 在 米 所 波 大 米 ， 犹 太 ， 加 帕 多 家 ， 本 都 ， 亚 西 亚 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Men of Parthia, Media, and Elam, and those living in Mesopotamia, in Judaea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,
<br>2:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;弗 吕 家 ， 旁 非 利 亚 ， 埃 及 的 人 ， 并 靠 近 古 利 奈 的 吕 彼 亚 一 带 地 方 的 人 ， 从 罗 马 来 的 客 旅 中 ， 或 是 犹 太 人 ， 或 是 进 犹 太 教 的 人 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;In Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and those who have come from Rome, Jews by birth and others who have become Jews,
<br>2:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;革 哩 底 和 亚 拉 伯 人 ， 都 听 见 他 们 用 我 们 的 乡 谈 ， 讲 说 神 的 大 作 为 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Men of Crete and Arabia, to all of us they are talking in our different languages, of the great works of God.
<br>2:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 就 都 惊 讶 猜 疑 ， 彼 此 说 ， 这 是 什 么 意 思 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they were all surprised and in doubt saying to one another, What is the reason of this?
<br>2:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;还 有 人 讥 诮 说 ， 他 们 无 非 是 新 酒 灌 满 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But others, making sport of them, said, They are full of new wine.
<br>2:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 和 十 一 个 使 徒 ， 站 起 ， 高 声 说 ， 犹 太 人 ， 和 一 切 住 在 耶 路 撒 冷 的 人 哪 ， 这 件 事 你 们 当 知 道 ， 也 当 侧 耳 听 我 的 话 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Peter, getting up, with the eleven, said in a loud voice, O men of Judaea, and all you who are living in Jerusalem, take note of this and give ear to my words.
<br>2:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 想 这 些 人 是 醉 了 ， 其 实 不 是 醉 了 ， 因 为 时 候 刚 到 巳 初 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For these men are not overcome with wine, as it seems to you, for it is only the third hour of the day;
<br>2:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 正 是 先 知 约 珥 所 说 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But this is the thing which was said by the prophet Joel;
<br>2:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;神 说 ， 在 末 后 的 日 子 ， 我 要 将 我 的 灵 浇 灌 凡 有 血 气 的 。 你 们 的 儿 女 要 说 预 言 。 你 们 的 少 年 人 要 见 异 象 。 老 年 人 要 作 异 梦 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And it will come about, in the last days, says God, that I will send out my Spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters will be prophets, and your young men will see visions, and your old men will have dreams:
<br>2:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 那 些 日 子 ， 我 要 将 我 的 灵 浇 灌 我 的 仆 人 和 使 女 ， 他 们 就 要 说 预 言 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And on my men-servants and my women-servants I will send my Spirit, and they will be prophets.
<br>2:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 天 上 我 要 显 出 奇 事 ， 在 地 下 我 要 显 出 神 迹 ， 有 血 ， 有 火 ， 有 烟 雾 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And wonders will be seen in heaven, and signs on the earth, blood and fire and smoke:
<br>2:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;日 头 要 变 为 黑 暗 ， 月 亮 要 变 为 血 ， 这 都 在 主 大 而 明 显 的 日 子 未 到 以 前 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The sun will become dark and the moon will be turned to blood, before that great day of the Lord comes in glory:
<br>2:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;到 那 时 候 ， 凡 求 告 主 名 的 ， 就 必 得 救 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And whoever makes his prayer to the Lord will have salvation.
<br>2:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;以 色 列 人 哪 ， 请 听 我 的 话 。 神 借 着 拿 撒 勒 人 耶 稣 ， 在 你 们 中 间 施 行 异 能 ， 奇 事 ， 神 迹 ， 将 他 证 明 出 来 ， 这 是 你 们 自 己 知 道 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Men of Israel, give ear to these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man who had the approval of God, as was made clear to you by the great works and signs and wonders which God did by him among you, as you yourselves have knowledge,
<br>2:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 既 按 着 神 的 定 旨 先 见 ， 被 交 与 人 ， 你 们 就 借 着 无 法 之 人 的 手 ， 把 他 钉 在 十 字 架 上 杀 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Him, when he was given up, by the decision and knowledge of God, you put to death on the cross, by the hands of evil men:
<br>2:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;神 却 将 死 的 痛 苦 解 释 了 ， 叫 他 复 活 。 因 为 他 原 不 能 被 死 拘 禁 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But God gave him back to life, having made him free from the pains of death because it was not possible for him to be overcome by it.
<br>2:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;大 卫 指 着 他 说 ， 我 看 见 主 常 在 我 眼 前 ， 他 在 我 右 边 ， 叫 我 不 至 于 摇 动 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For David said of him, I saw the Lord before my face at all times, for he is at my right hand, so that I may not be moved:
<br>2:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;所 以 我 心 里 欢 喜 ， 我 的 灵 （ 原 文 作 舌 ） 快 乐 。 并 且 我 的 肉 身 要 安 居 在 指 望 中 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And for this cause my heart was glad and my tongue full of joy, and my flesh will be resting in hope:
<br>2:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 你 必 不 将 我 的 灵 魂 撇 在 阴 间 ， 也 不 叫 你 的 圣 者 见 朽 坏 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For you will not let my soul be in hell and you will not give up your Holy One to destruction.
<br>2:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 已 将 生 命 的 道 路 指 示 我 ， 必 叫 我 因 见 你 的 面 ， （ 或 作 叫 我 在 你 面 前 ） 得 着 满 足 的 快 乐 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;You have made me see the ways of life; I will be full of joy when I see your face.
<br>2:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;弟 兄 们 ， 先 祖 大 卫 的 事 ， 我 可 以 明 明 地 对 你 们 说 ， 他 死 了 ， 也 葬 埋 了 ， 并 且 他 的 坟 墓 ， 直 到 今 日 还 在 我 们 这 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;My brothers, I may say to you openly that David came to his death, and was put in the earth, and his resting-place is with us today.
<br>2:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;大 卫 既 是 先 知 ， 又 晓 得 神 曾 向 他 起 誓 ， 要 从 他 的 后 裔 中 ， 立 一 位 坐 在 他 的 宝 座 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But being a prophet, and having in mind the oath which God had given to him, that of the fruit of his body one would take his place as a king,
<br>2:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 预 先 看 明 这 事 ， 讲 论 基 督 复 活 说 ， 他 的 灵 魂 ， 不 撇 在 阴 间 ， 他 的 肉 身 ， 也 不 见 朽 坏 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He, having knowledge of the future, was talking of the coming again of Christ from the dead, that he was not kept in hell and his body did not see destruction.
<br>2:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 耶 稣 ， 神 已 经 叫 他 复 活 了 ， 我 们 都 为 这 事 作 见 证 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;This Jesus God has given back to life, of which we all are witnesses.
<br>2:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 既 被 神 的 右 手 高 举 ， （ 或 作 他 既 高 举 在 神 的 右 边 ） 又 从 父 受 了 所 应 许 的 圣 灵 ， 就 把 你 们 所 看 见 所 听 见 的 ， 浇 灌 下 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And so, being lifted up to the right hand of God, and having the Father's word that the Holy Spirit would come, he has sent this thing, which now you see and have knowledge of.
<br>2:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;大 卫 并 没 有 升 到 天 上 ， 但 自 己 说 ， 主 对 我 主 说 ， 你 坐 在 我 的 右 边 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For David has not gone up into heaven, but says, himself, The Lord said to my Lord, Be seated at my right hand,
<br>2:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;等 我 使 你 仇 敌 作 你 的 脚 凳 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Until I make thy foes thy footstool.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Till I put all those who are against you under your feet.
<br>2:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;故 此 ， 以 色 列 全 家 当 确 实 的 知 道 ， 你 们 钉 在 十 字 架 上 的 这 位 耶 稣 ， 神 已 经 立 他 为 主 为 基 督 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For this reason, let all Israel be certain that this Jesus, whom you put to death on the cross, God has made Lord and Christ.
<br>2:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 听 见 这 话 ， 觉 得 扎 心 ， 就 对 彼 得 和 其 余 的 使 徒 说 ， 弟 兄 们 ， 我 们 当 怎 样 行 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now when these words came to their ears their hearts were troubled, and they said to Peter and the other Apostles, Brothers, what are we to do?
<br>2:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 说 ， 你 们 各 人 要 悔 改 ， 奉 耶 稣 基 督 的 名 受 洗 ， 叫 你 们 的 罪 得 赦 ， 就 必 领 受 所 赐 的 圣 灵 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Peter said, Let your hearts be changed, every one of you, and have baptism in the name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will have the Holy Spirit given to you.
<br>2:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 这 应 许 是 给 你 们 ， 和 你 们 的 儿 女 ， 并 一 切 在 远 方 的 人 ， 就 是 主 我 们 神 所 召 来 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For the word of God is for you and for your children and for all those who are far off, even all those who may be marked out by the Lord our God.
<br>2:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 还 用 许 多 话 作 见 证 ， 劝 勉 他 们 说 ， 你 们 当 救 自 己 脱 离 这 弯 曲 的 世 代 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And with more such words he gave his witness, offering them salvation and saying, Come out from this evil generation.
<br>2:41&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 领 受 他 话 的 人 ， 就 受 了 洗 ， 那 一 天 ， 门 徒 约 添 了 三 千 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then those who gave hearing to his words had baptism: and about three thousand souls were joined to them that day.
<br>2:42&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;都 恒 心 遵 守 使 徒 的 教 训 ， 彼 此 交 接 ， 掰 饼 ， 祈 祷 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they kept their attention fixed on the Apostles' teaching and were united together in the taking of broken bread and in prayer.
<br>2:43&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 都 惧 怕 。 使 徒 又 行 了 许 多 奇 事 神 迹 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But fear came on every soul: and all sorts of wonders and signs were done by the Apostles.
<br>2:44&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;信 的 人 都 在 一 处 ， 凡 物 公 用 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And all that believed were together, and had all things common;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And all those who were of the faith kept together, and had all things in common;
<br>2:45&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;并 且 卖 了 田 产 家 业 ， 照 各 人 所 需 用 的 分 给 各 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And exchanging their goods and property for money, they made division of it among them all, as they had need.
<br>2:46&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 天 天 同 心 合 意 ， 恒 切 地 在 殿 里 且 在 家 中 掰 饼 ， 存 着 欢 喜 诚 实 的 心 用 饭 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And day by day, going in agreement together regularly to the Temple and, taking broken bread together in their houses, they took their food with joy and with true hearts,
<br>2:47&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;赞 美 神 ， 得 众 民 的 喜 爱 。 主 将 得 救 的 人 ， 天 天 加 给 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Giving praise to God, and having the approval of all the people; and every day the number of those who had salvation was increased by the Lord.
