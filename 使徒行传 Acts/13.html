<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now there were at Antioch, in the church there, prophets and teachers, Barnabas, and Symeon who was named Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, a relation of Herod the king, and Saul.
<br>13:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 事 奉 主 ， 禁 食 的 时 候 ， 圣 灵 说 ， 要 为 我 分 派 巴 拿 巴 和 扫 罗 ， 去 作 我 召 他 们 所 作 的 工 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And while they were doing the Lord's work, and going without food, the Holy Spirit said, Let Barnabas and Saul be given to me for the special work for which they have been marked out by me.
<br>13:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 禁 食 祷 告 ， 按 手 在 他 们 头 上 ， 就 打 发 他 们 去 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then, after prayer and going without food they put their hands on them, and sent them away.
<br>13:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 既 被 圣 灵 差 遣 ， 就 下 到 西 流 基 ， 从 那 里 坐 船 往 居 比 路 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia; and from there they went by ship to Cyprus.
<br>13:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;到 了 撒 拉 米 ， 就 在 犹 太 人 各 会 堂 里 传 讲 神 的 道 。 也 有 约 翰 作 他 们 的 帮 手 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And at Salamis they were preaching the word of God in the Synagogues of the Jews: and John was with them, helping them.
<br>13:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;经 过 全 岛 ， 直 到 帕 弗 ， 在 那 里 遇 见 一 个 有 法 术 假 充 先 知 的 犹 太 人 ， 名 叫 巴 耶 稣 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when they had gone through all the island to Paphos, they came across a certain wonder-worker and false prophet, a Jew whose name was Bar-Jesus;
<br>13:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 人 常 和 方 伯 士 求 保 罗 同 在 ， 士 求 保 罗 是 个 通 达 人 。 他 请 了 巴 拿 巴 和 扫 罗 来 ， 要 听 神 的 道 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Who was with the ruler, Sergius Paulus, an able man. This man sent for Barnabas and Saul, desiring to have knowledge of the word of God.
<br>13:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;只 是 那 行 法 术 的 以 吕 马 ， （ 这 名 翻 出 来 就 是 行 法 术 的 意 思 ） 敌 挡 使 徒 ， 要 叫 方 伯 不 信 真 道 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Elymas, the wonder-worker (for that is the sense of his name), put himself against them, with the purpose of turning the ruler from the faith.
<br>13:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;扫 罗 又 名 保 罗 ， 被 圣 灵 充 满 定 睛 看 他 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Saul, whose other name is Paul, being full of the Holy Spirit, looking hard at him, said,
<br>13:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;说 ， 你 这 充 满 各 样 诡 诈 奸 恶 ， 魔 鬼 的 儿 子 ， 众 善 的 仇 敌 ， 你 混 乱 主 的 正 道 还 不 止 住 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;O you, who are full of false tricks and evil ways, a son of the Evil One, hating all righteousness, will you for ever be turning people from the right ways of the Lord?
<br>13:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;现 在 主 的 手 加 在 你 身 上 。 你 要 瞎 眼 ， 暂 且 不 见 日 光 。 他 的 眼 睛 立 刻 昏 蒙 黑 暗 ， 四 下 里 求 人 拉 着 手 领 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And now, see, the hand of the Lord is on you, and you will be blind and not able to see the sun for a time. And straight away a dark mist came down on him; and he went about looking for a guide.
<br>13:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;方 伯 看 见 所 作 的 事 ， 很 希 奇 主 的 道 ， 就 信 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then the ruler, when he saw what was done, had faith, being full of wonder at the teaching of the Lord.
<br>13:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;保 罗 和 他 的 同 人 ， 从 帕 弗 开 船 ， 来 到 旁 非 利 亚 的 别 加 。 约 翰 就 离 开 他 们 回 耶 路 撒 冷 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Paul and those who were with him went by ship from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia: and there John went away from them and came back to Jerusalem.
<br>13:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 离 了 别 加 往 前 行 ， 来 到 彼 西 底 的 安 提 阿 。 在 安 息 日 进 会 堂 坐 下 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But they, going through from Perga, came to Antioch in Pisidia; and they went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath and were seated.
<br>13:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;读 完 了 律 法 和 先 知 的 书 ， 管 会 堂 的 叫 人 过 去 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 二 位 兄 台 ， 若 有 什 么 劝 勉 众 人 的 话 ， 请 说 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And after the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the Synagogue sent to them, saying, Brothers, if you have a word of comfort for the people, say on.
<br>13:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;保 罗 就 站 起 来 ， 举 手 说 ， 以 色 列 人 ， 和 一 切 敬 畏 神 的 人 ， 请 听 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Paul, getting up and making a sign with his hand, said, Men of Israel, and you who have the fear of God, give ear.
<br>13:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 以 色 列 民 的 神 ， 拣 选 了 我 们 的 祖 宗 ， 当 民 寄 居 埃 及 的 时 候 ， 抬 举 他 们 ， 用 大 能 的 手 领 他 们 出 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The God of this people Israel made selection of our fathers, lifting the people up from their low condition when they were living in the land of Egypt, and with a strong arm took them out of it.
<br>13:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 在 旷 野 容 忍 他 们 约 有 四 十 年 。 （ 容 忍 或 作 抚 养 ）
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And for about forty years he put up with their ways in the waste land.
<br>13:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;既 灭 了 迦 南 地 七 族 的 人 ， 就 把 那 地 分 给 他 们 为 业 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And having put to destruction seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them the land for their heritage for about four hundred and fifty years.
<br>13:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;此 后 ， 给 他 们 设 立 士 师 ， 约 有 四 百 五 十 年 ， 直 到 先 知 撒 母 耳 的 时 候 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And after these things he gave them judges, till the time of Samuel the prophet.
<br>13:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;后 来 他 们 求 一 个 王 ， 神 就 将 便 雅 悯 支 派 中 ， 基 士 的 儿 子 扫 罗 ， 给 他 们 作 王 四 十 年 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then at their request for a king, God gave them Saul, the son of Kish, a man of the family of Benjamin, who was their king for forty years.
<br>13:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;既 废 了 扫 罗 ， 就 选 立 大 卫 作 他 们 的 王 。 又 为 他 作 见 证 说 ， 我 寻 得 耶 西 的 儿 子 大 卫 ， 他 是 合 我 心 意 的 人 ， 凡 事 要 遵 行 我 的 旨 意 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And having put him on one side, he made David their king, to whom he gave witness, saying, I have taken David, the son of Jesse, a man dear to my heart, who will do all my pleasure.
<br>13:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;从 这 人 的 后 裔 中 ， 神 已 经 照 着 所 应 许 的 ， 为 以 色 列 人 立 了 一 位 救 主 ， 就 是 耶 稣 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;From this man's seed has God given to Israel a Saviour, even Jesus, as he gave his word;
<br>13:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 他 没 有 出 来 以 先 ， 约 翰 向 以 色 列 众 民 宣 讲 悔 改 的 洗 礼 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For whose coming John made ready the way by preaching to all the people of Israel the baptism which goes with a change of heart.
<br>13:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;约 翰 将 行 尽 他 的 程 途 说 ， 你 们 以 为 我 是 谁 ？ 我 不 是 基 督 。 只 是 有 一 位 在 我 以 后 来 的 ， 我 解 他 脚 上 的 鞋 带 ， 也 是 不 配 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when John was completing his work, he said, What do I seem to you to be? I am not he; but one is coming after me, whose shoes I am not good enough to undo.
<br>13:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;弟 兄 们 ， 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 子 孙 ， 和 你 们 中 间 敬 畏 神 的 人 哪 ， 这 救 世 的 道 ， 是 传 给 我 们 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;My brothers, children of the family of Abraham, and those among you who have the fear of God, to us the word of this salvation is sent.
<br>13:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 路 撒 冷 居 住 的 人 ， 和 他 们 的 官 长 ， 因 为 不 认 识 基 督 ， 也 不 明 白 每 安 息 日 所 读 众 先 知 的 书 ， 就 把 基 督 定 了 死 罪 ， 正 应 了 先 知 的 预 言 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For the men of Jerusalem and their rulers, having no knowledge of him, or of the sayings of the prophets which come to their ears every Sabbath day, gave effect to them by judging him.
<br>13:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;虽 然 查 不 出 他 有 当 死 的 罪 来 ， 还 是 求 彼 拉 多 杀 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And though no cause of death was seen in him, they made a request to Pilate that he might be put to death.
<br>13:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;既 成 就 了 经 上 指 着 他 所 记 的 一 切 话 ， 就 把 他 从 木 头 上 取 下 来 ， 放 在 坟 墓 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when they had done all the things said in the Writings about him, they took him down from the tree, and put him in the place of the dead.
<br>13:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;神 却 叫 他 从 死 里 复 活 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But God raised him from the dead:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But God gave him back from the dead:
<br>13:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 从 加 利 利 同 他 上 耶 路 撒 冷 的 人 多 日 看 见 他 ， 这 些 人 如 今 在 民 间 是 他 的 见 证 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And for a number of days he was seen by those who came with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses before the people.
<br>13:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 们 也 报 好 信 息 给 你 们 ， 就 是 那 应 许 祖 宗 的 话 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And we are giving you the good news of the undertaking made to the fathers,
<br>13:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;神 已 经 向 我 们 这 作 儿 女 的 应 验 ， 叫 耶 稣 复 活 了 。 正 如 诗 篇 第 二 篇 上 记 着 说 ， 你 是 我 的 儿 子 ， 我 今 日 生 你 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Which God has now put into effect for our children, by sending Jesus; as it says in the second Psalm, You are my Son; this day I have given you being.
<br>13:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;论 到 神 叫 他 从 死 里 复 活 ， 不 再 归 于 朽 坏 ， 就 这 样 说 ， 我 必 将 所 应 许 大 卫 那 圣 洁 可 靠 的 恩 典 ， 赐 给 你 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And about his coming back from the dead, never again to go to destruction, he has said these words, I will give you the holy and certain mercies of David.
<br>13:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 有 一 篇 上 说 ， 你 必 不 叫 你 的 圣 者 见 朽 坏 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Because he says in another Psalm, You will not let your Holy One see destruction.
<br>13:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;大 卫 在 世 的 时 候 ， 遵 行 了 神 的 旨 意 ， 就 睡 了 ， （ 或 作 大 卫 按 神 的 旨 意 服 事 了 他 那 一 世 的 人 就 睡 了 ） 。 归 到 他 祖 宗 那 里 ， 已 见 朽 坏 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now David, having done God's work for his generation, went to sleep, and was put with his fathers, and his body came to destruction:
<br>13:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;惟 独 神 所 复 活 的 ， 他 并 未 见 朽 坏 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But he, who was lifted up by God, did not see destruction.
<br>13:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;所 以 弟 兄 们 ， 你 们 当 晓 得 ， 赦 罪 的 道 是 由 这 人 传 给 你 们 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And so, let it be clear to you, my brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is offered to you:
<br>13:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 靠 摩 西 的 律 法 ， 在 一 切 不 得 称 义 的 事 上 ， 信 靠 这 人 ， 就 都 得 称 义 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And through him everyone who has faith is made free from all those things, from which the law of Moses was not able to make you free.
<br>13:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;所 以 你 们 务 要 小 心 ， 免 得 先 知 书 上 所 说 的 临 到 你 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So take care that these words of the prophets do not come true for you;
<br>13:41&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;主 说 ， 你 们 这 轻 慢 的 人 要 观 看 ， 要 惊 奇 ， 要 灭 亡 。 因 为 在 你 们 的 时 候 ， 我 行 一 件 事 ， 虽 有 人 告 诉 你 们 ， 你 们 总 是 不 信 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;See, you doubters, have wonder and come to your end; for I will do a thing in your days to which you will not give belief, even if it is made clear to you.
<br>13:42&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 出 会 堂 的 时 候 ， 众 人 请 他 们 到 下 安 息 日 ， 再 讲 这 话 给 他 们 听 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when they went out, they made a request that these words might be said to them again on the Sabbath after.
<br>13:43&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;散 会 以 后 ， 犹 太 人 和 敬 虔 进 犹 太 教 的 人 ， 多 有 跟 从 保 罗 ， 巴 拿 巴 的 ， 二 人 对 他 们 讲 道 ， 劝 他 们 务 要 恒 久 在 神 的 恩 中 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now when the meeting was ended, a number of the Jews and of the God-fearing Gentiles who had become Jews, went after Paul and Barnabas: who put before them how important it was to keep on in the grace of God.
<br>13:44&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;到 下 安 息 日 ， 合 城 的 人 ， 几 乎 都 来 聚 集 ， 要 听 神 的 道 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And on the Sabbath after, almost all the town came together to give hearing to the word of God.
<br>13:45&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 犹 太 人 看 见 人 这 样 多 ， 就 满 心 嫉 妒 ， 硬 驳 保 罗 所 说 的 话 ， 并 且 毁 谤 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But when the Jews saw such a great number of people, they were full of envy and said evil words against Paul's preaching.
<br>13:46&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;保 罗 和 巴 拿 巴 放 胆 说 ， 神 的 道 先 讲 给 你 们 ， 原 是 应 当 的 ， 只 因 你 们 弃 绝 这 道 ， 断 定 自 己 不 配 得 永 生 ， 我 们 就 转 向 外 邦 人 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Paul and Barnabas without fear said, It was necessary for the word of God to be given to you first; but because you will have nothing to do with it, and have no desire for eternal life, it will now be offered to the Gentiles.
<br>13:47&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 主 曾 这 样 吩 咐 我 们 说 ， 我 已 经 立 你 作 外 邦 人 的 光 ， 叫 你 施 行 救 恩 直 到 地 极 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For so the Lord has given us orders, saying, I have given you for a light to the Gentiles so that you may be for salvation to the ends of the earth.
<br>13:48&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;外 邦 人 听 见 这 话 ， 就 欢 喜 了 ， 赞 美 神 的 道 ， 凡 预 定 得 永 生 的 人 都 信 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the Gentiles, hearing this, were glad and gave glory to the word of God: and those marked out by God for eternal life had faith.
<br>13:49&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 主 的 道 ， 传 遍 了 那 一 带 地 方 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the word of the Lord went through all the country.
<br>13:50&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 犹 太 人 挑 唆 虔 敬 尊 贵 的 妇 女 ， 和 城 内 有 名 望 的 人 ， 逼 迫 保 罗 ， 巴 拿 巴 ， 将 他 们 赶 出 境 外 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But the Jews, working up the feelings of the God-fearing women of high position and of the chief men of the town, got an attack started against Paul and Barnabas, driving them out of those parts.
<br>13:51&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;二 人 对 着 众 人 跺 下 脚 上 的 尘 土 ， 就 往 以 哥 念 去 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But they, shaking off the dust of that place from their feet, came to Iconium.
<br>13:52&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;门 徒 满 心 喜 乐 ， 又 被 圣 灵 充 满 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the disciples were full of joy and of the Holy Spirit.
