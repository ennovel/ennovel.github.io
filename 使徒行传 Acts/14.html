<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now in Iconium they went together to the Synagogue of the Jews and gave such teaching that a great number of Jews and Greeks had faith.
<br>14:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 那 不 顺 从 的 犹 太 人 耸 动 外 邦 人 ， 叫 他 们 心 里 恼 恨 弟 兄 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But those Jews who had not the faith, made the minds of the Gentiles bitter against the brothers.
<br>14:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;二 人 在 那 里 住 了 多 日 ， 倚 靠 主 放 胆 讲 道 。 主 借 他 们 的 手 ， 施 行 神 迹 奇 事 ， 证 明 他 的 恩 道 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So they kept there for a long time, taking heart in the Lord, who gave witness to the word of his grace by causing signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
<br>14:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;城 里 的 众 人 就 分 了 党 。 有 附 从 犹 太 人 的 ， 有 附 从 使 徒 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But there was a division among the people of the town; some were on the side of the Jews and some on the side of the Apostles.
<br>14:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 时 ， 外 邦 人 和 犹 太 人 ， 并 他 们 的 官 长 ， 一 齐 拥 上 来 ， 要 凌 辱 使 徒 ， 用 石 头 打 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when a violent attempt was made by the Gentiles and the Jews, with their rulers, to make an attack on them and have them stoned,
<br>14:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;使 徒 知 道 了 ， 就 逃 往 吕 高 尼 的 路 司 得 ， 特 庇 ， 两 个 城 ， 和 周 围 地 方 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Having got news of it, they went in flight to the towns of Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and the country round about:
<br>14:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 那 里 传 福 音 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there they preached the gospel.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And went on preaching the good news there.
<br>14:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;路 司 得 城 里 ， 坐 着 一 个 两 脚 无 力 的 人 ， 生 来 是 瘸 腿 的 ， 从 来 没 有 走 过 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And at Lystra there was a certain man, who from birth had been without the use of his feet, never having had the power of walking.
<br>14:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 听 保 罗 讲 道 。 保 罗 定 睛 看 他 ， 见 他 有 信 心 ， 可 得 痊 愈 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;This man was giving ear to the preaching of Paul, who, looking at him, and seeing that he had faith to be made well,
<br>14:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 大 声 说 ， 你 起 来 ， 两 脚 站 直 。 那 人 就 跳 起 来 而 且 行 走 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Said in a loud voice, Get up on your feet. And, jumping up, he went walking about.
<br>14:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 看 见 保 罗 所 作 的 事 ， 就 用 吕 高 尼 的 话 ， 大 声 说 ， 有 神 借 着 人 形 ， 降 临 在 我 们 中 间 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the people saw what Paul had done, they said in a loud voice, in the language of Lycaonia, The gods have come down to us in the form of men.
<br>14:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 称 巴 拿 巴 为 丢 斯 ， 称 保 罗 为 希 耳 米 ， 因 为 他 说 话 领 首 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they gave the name of Jupiter to Barnabas, and to Paul that of Mercury, because he was the chief talker.
<br>14:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 城 外 丢 斯 庙 的 祭 司 ， 牵 着 牛 ， 拿 着 花 圈 ， 来 到 门 前 ， 要 同 众 人 向 使 徒 献 祭 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the priest of the image of Jupiter, which was before the town, took oxen and flowers to the doors of the town, and was about to make an offering with the people.
<br>14:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;巴 拿 巴 ， 保 罗 ， 二 使 徒 听 见 ， 就 撕 开 衣 裳 ， 跳 进 众 人 中 间 ， 喊 着 说 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But when this came to the ears of the Apostles, Paul and Barnabas, they went running out among the people, parting their clothing, and crying out,
<br>14:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;诸 君 ， 为 什 么 作 这 事 呢 ？ 我 们 也 是 人 ， 性 情 和 你 们 一 样 。 我 们 传 福 音 给 你 们 ， 是 叫 你 们 离 弃 这 些 虚 妄 ， 归 向 那 创 造 天 ， 地 ， 海 ， 和 其 中 万 物 的 永 生 神 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Good people, why are you doing these things? We are men with the same feelings as you, and we give you the good news so that you may be turned away from these foolish things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all things in them:
<br>14:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 在 从 前 的 世 代 ， 任 凭 万 国 各 行 其 道 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Who in the past let all nations go in the ways which seemed good to them.
<br>14:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;然 而 为 自 己 未 尝 不 显 出 证 据 来 ， 就 如 常 施 恩 惠 ， 从 天 降 雨 ， 赏 赐 丰 年 ， 叫 你 们 饮 食 饱 足 ， 满 心 喜 乐 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But he was not without witness, because he did good, and gave you rain from heaven and times of fruit, making your hearts full of food and joy.
<br>14:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;二 人 说 了 这 些 话 ， 仅 仅 地 拦 住 众 人 不 献 祭 与 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And even with these words, it was hard for them to keep the people from making an offering to them.
<br>14:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 有 些 犹 太 人 ， 从 安 提 阿 和 以 哥 念 来 ， 挑 唆 众 人 ， 就 用 石 头 打 保 罗 ， 以 为 他 是 死 了 ， 便 拖 到 城 外 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But some Jews came to that place from Antioch and Iconium, and got control over the people; and after stoning Paul, they had him pulled out of the town, taking him for dead.
<br>14:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;门 徒 正 围 着 他 ， 他 就 起 来 ， 走 进 城 去 。 第 二 天 ， 同 巴 拿 巴 往 特 庇 去 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But when the disciples came round him, he got up and went into the town: and the day after he went away with Barnabas to Derbe.
<br>14:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;对 那 城 里 的 人 传 了 福 音 ， 使 好 些 人 作 门 徒 。 就 回 路 司 得 ， 以 哥 念 ， 安 提 阿 去 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And having made a number of disciples through the preaching of the good news in that town, they went back to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch,
<br>14:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;坚 固 门 徒 的 心 ， 劝 他 们 恒 守 所 信 的 道 。 又 说 ， 我 们 进 入 神 的 国 ， 必 须 经 历 许 多 艰 难 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Making strong the souls of the disciples, saying to them that they were to keep the faith, and that we have to go through troubles of all sorts to come into the kingdom of God.
<br>14:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;二 人 在 各 教 会 中 选 立 了 长 老 ， 又 禁 食 祷 告 ， 就 把 他 们 交 托 所 信 的 主 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when they had made selection of some to be rulers in every church, and had given themselves to prayer and kept themselves from food, they put them into the care of the Lord in whom they had faith.
<br>14:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;二 人 经 过 彼 西 底 ， 来 到 旁 非 利 亚 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they went through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia.
<br>14:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 别 加 讲 了 道 ， 就 下 亚 大 利 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And, after preaching the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia;
<br>14:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;从 那 里 坐 船 ， 往 安 提 阿 去 。 当 初 他 们 被 众 人 所 托 蒙 神 之 恩 ， 要 办 现 在 所 作 之 工 ， 就 是 在 这 地 方 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And from there they went by ship to Antioch, where they had been handed over to the grace of God for the work which they had not done.
<br>14:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;到 了 那 里 ， 聚 集 了 会 众 ， 就 述 说 神 借 他 们 所 行 的 一 切 事 ， 并 神 怎 样 为 外 邦 人 开 了 信 道 的 门 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when they came there, and had got the church together, they gave them an account of all the things which God had done through them, and how he had made open a door of faith to the Gentiles.
<br>14:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;二 人 就 在 那 里 同 门 徒 住 了 多 日 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there they abode long time with the disciples.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they were with the disciples there for a long time.
