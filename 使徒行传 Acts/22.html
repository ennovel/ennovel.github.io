<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto you.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;My brothers and fathers, give ear to the story of my life which I now put before you.
<br>22:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 听 他 说 的 是 希 伯 来 话 ， 就 更 加 安 静 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And, hearing him talking in the Hebrew language, they became the more quiet, and he said,
<br>22:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;保 罗 说 ， 我 原 是 犹 太 人 ， 生 在 基 利 家 的 大 数 ， 长 在 这 城 里 ， 在 迦 玛 列 门 下 ， 按 着 我 们 祖 宗 严 紧 的 律 法 受 教 ， 热 心 事 奉 神 ， 象 你 们 众 人 今 日 一 样 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia by birth, but I had my education in this town at the feet of Gamaliel, being trained in the keeping of every detail of the law of our fathers; given up to the cause of God with all my heart, as you are today.
<br>22:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 也 曾 逼 迫 奉 这 道 的 人 ， 直 到 死 地 ， 无 论 男 女 都 锁 拿 下 监 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And I made attacks on this Way, even to death, taking men and women and putting them in prison.
<br>22:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 是 大 祭 司 和 众 长 老 都 可 以 给 我 作 见 证 的 。 我 又 领 了 他 们 达 与 弟 兄 的 书 信 ， 往 大 马 色 去 ， 要 把 在 那 里 奉 这 道 的 人 锁 拿 ， 带 到 耶 路 撒 冷 受 刑 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Of which the high priest will be a witness, and all the rulers, from whom I had letters to the brothers; and I went into Damascus, to take those who were there as prisoners to Jerusalem for punishment.
<br>22:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 将 到 大 马 色 ， 正 走 的 时 候 ， 约 在 晌 午 ， 忽 然 从 天 上 发 大 光 ， 四 面 照 着 我 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And it came about that while I was on my journey, coming near to Damascus, about the middle of the day, suddenly I saw a great light from heaven shining round me.
<br>22:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 就 仆 倒 在 地 ， 听 见 有 声 音 对 我 说 ， 扫 罗 ， 扫 罗 ， 你 为 什 么 逼 迫 我 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when I went down on the earth, a voice came to my ears saying to me, Saul, Saul, why are you attacking me so cruelly?
<br>22:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 回 答 说 ， 主 阿 ， 你 是 谁 ？ 他 说 ， 我 就 是 你 所 逼 迫 的 拿 撒 勒 人 耶 稣 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And I, answering, said, Who are you; Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are attacking.
<br>22:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;与 我 同 行 的 人 ， 看 见 了 那 光 ， 却 没 有 听 明 那 位 对 我 说 话 的 声 音 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And those who were with me saw the light, but the voice of him who was talking to me came not to their ears.
<br>22:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 说 ， 主 阿 ， 我 当 作 什 么 。 主 说 ， 起 来 ， 进 大 马 色 去 ， 在 那 里 要 将 所 派 你 作 的 一 切 事 ， 告 诉 你 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And I said, What shall I do, LORD? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And I said, What have I to do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Get up, and go into Damascus; and it will be made clear to you what you have to do.
<br>22:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 因 那 光 的 荣 耀 ， 不 能 看 见 ， 同 行 的 人 ， 就 拉 着 我 手 进 了 大 马 色 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And because I was unable to see because of the glory of that light, those who were with me took me by the hand, and so I came to Damascus.
<br>22:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 里 有 一 个 人 ， 名 叫 亚 拿 尼 亚 ， 按 着 律 法 是 虔 诚 人 ， 为 一 切 住 在 那 里 的 犹 太 人 所 称 赞 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And one Ananias, a God-fearing man, who kept the law, and of whom all the Jews in that place had a high opinion,
<br>22:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 来 见 我 ， 站 在 旁 边 ， 对 我 说 ， 兄 弟 扫 罗 ， 你 可 以 看 见 。 我 当 时 往 上 一 看 ， 就 看 见 了 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Came to my side and said, Brother Saul, let your eyes be open. And in that very hour I was able to see him.
<br>22:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 又 说 ， 我 们 祖 宗 的 神 ， 拣 选 了 你 ， 叫 你 明 白 他 的 旨 意 ， 又 得 见 那 义 者 ， 听 他 口 中 所 出 的 声 音 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said, You have been marked out by the God of our fathers to have knowledge of his purpose, and to see the Upright One and to give ear to the words of his mouth.
<br>22:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 你 要 将 所 看 见 的 ， 所 听 见 的 ， 对 着 万 人 为 他 作 见 证 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and of what has come to your ears.
<br>22:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;现 在 你 为 什 么 耽 延 呢 ？ 起 来 ， 求 告 他 的 名 受 洗 ， 洗 去 你 的 罪 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And now, why are you waiting? get up, and have baptism, for the washing away of your sins, giving worship to his name.
<br>22:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;后 来 我 回 到 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 在 殿 里 祷 告 的 时 候 ， 魂 游 象 外 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And it came about that when I had come back to Jerusalem, while I was at prayer in the Temple, my senses became more than naturally clear,
<br>22:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;看 见 主 向 我 说 ， 你 赶 紧 的 离 开 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 不 可 迟 延 ， 因 你 为 我 作 的 见 证 ， 这 里 的 人 ， 必 不 领 受 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And I saw him saying to me, Go out of Jerusalem straight away because they will not give hearing to your witness about me.
<br>22:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 就 说 ， 主 阿 ， 他 们 知 道 我 从 前 把 信 你 的 人 ， 收 在 监 里 ， 又 在 各 会 堂 里 鞭 打 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And I said, Lord, they themselves have knowledge that I went through the Synagogues putting in prison and whipping all those who had faith in you:
<br>22:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;并 且 你 的 见 证 人 司 提 反 ， 被 害 流 血 的 时 候 ， 我 也 站 在 旁 边 欢 喜 。 又 看 守 害 死 他 之 人 的 衣 裳 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when Stephen your witness was put to death, I was there, giving approval, and looking after the clothing of those who put him to death.
<br>22:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;主 向 我 说 ， 你 去 吧 。 我 要 差 你 远 远 地 往 外 邦 人 那 里 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to me, Go, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.
<br>22:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 听 他 说 到 这 句 话 ， 就 高 声 说 ， 这 样 的 人 ， 从 世 上 除 掉 他 吧 。 他 是 不 当 活 着 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they gave him a hearing as far as this word; then with loud voices they said, Away with this man from the earth; it is not right for him to be living.
<br>22:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 喧 嚷 ， 摔 掉 衣 裳 ， 把 尘 土 向 空 中 扬 起 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And while they were crying out, and pulling off their clothing, and sending dust into the air,
<br>22:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;千 夫 长 就 吩 咐 将 保 罗 带 进 营 楼 去 ， 叫 人 用 鞭 子 拷 问 他 ， 要 知 道 他 们 向 他 这 样 喧 嚷 ， 是 为 什 么 缘 故 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The chief captain gave orders for him to be taken into the army building, saying that he would put him to the test by whipping, so that he might have knowledge of the reason why they were crying out so violently against him.
<br>22:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;刚 用 皮 条 捆 上 ， 保 罗 对 旁 边 站 着 的 百 夫 长 说 ， 人 是 罗 马 人 ， 又 没 有 定 罪 ， 你 们 就 鞭 打 他 ， 有 这 个 例 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when they had put leather bands round him, Paul said to the captain who was present, Is it the law for you to give blows to a man who is a Roman and has not been judged?
<br>22:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;百 夫 长 听 见 这 话 ， 就 去 见 千 夫 长 ， 告 诉 他 说 ， 你 要 作 什 么 ？ 这 人 是 罗 马 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And hearing this, the man went to the chief captain and gave him an account of it, saying, What are you about to do? for this man is a Roman.
<br>22:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;千 夫 长 就 来 问 保 罗 说 ， 你 告 诉 我 ， 你 是 罗 马 人 吗 ？ 保 罗 说 ， 是 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the chief captain came to him and said, Give me an answer, are you a Roman? And he said, Yes.
<br>22:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;千 夫 长 说 ， 我 用 许 多 银 子 ， 才 入 了 罗 马 的 民 籍 。 保 罗 说 ， 我 生 来 就 是 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the chief captain said, I got Roman rights for myself at a great price. And Paul said, But I had them by birth.
<br>22:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 那 些 要 拷 问 保 罗 的 人 ， 就 离 开 他 去 了 。 千 夫 长 既 知 道 他 是 罗 马 人 ， 又 因 为 捆 绑 了 他 ， 也 害 怕 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then those who were about to put him to the test went away: and the chief captain was in fear, seeing that he was a Roman, and that he had put chains on him.
<br>22:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;第 二 天 ， 千 夫 长 为 要 知 道 犹 太 人 控 告 保 罗 的 实 情 ， 便 解 开 他 ， 吩 咐 祭 司 长 和 全 公 会 的 人 ， 都 聚 集 ， 将 保 罗 带 下 来 ， 叫 他 站 在 他 们 面 前 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But on the day after, desiring to have certain knowledge of what the Jews had to say against him, he made him free, and gave orders for the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to come together, and he took Paul and put him before them.
