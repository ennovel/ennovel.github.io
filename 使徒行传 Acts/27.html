<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the decision had been made that we were to go by sea to Italy, they gave Paul and certain other prisoners into the care of a captain named Julius, of the Augustan band.
<br>27:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 一 只 亚 大 米 田 的 船 ， 要 沿 着 亚 西 亚 一 带 地 方 的 海 边 走 ， 我 们 就 上 了 那 船 开 行 ， 有 马 其 顿 的 帖 撒 罗 尼 迦 人 ， 亚 里 达 古 ， 和 我 们 同 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And we went to sea in a ship of Adramyttium which was sailing to the sea towns of Asia, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
<br>27:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;第 二 天 ， 到 了 西 顿 。 犹 流 宽 待 保 罗 ， 准 他 往 朋 友 那 里 去 ， 受 他 们 的 照 应 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And on the day after, we came to Sidon; and Julius was kind to Paul, and let him go to see his friends and take a rest.
<br>27:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;从 那 里 又 开 船 ， 因 为 风 不 顺 ， 就 贴 着 居 比 路 背 风 岸 行 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And sailing again from there, we went on under cover of Cyprus, because the wind was against us.
<br>27:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;过 了 基 利 家 旁 非 利 亚 前 面 的 海 ， 就 到 了 吕 家 的 每 拉 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And having gone across the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia we came to Myra, in Lycia.
<br>27:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 那 里 百 夫 长 遇 见 一 只 亚 力 山 太 的 船 ， 要 往 义 大 利 去 ， 便 叫 我 们 上 了 那 船 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And there the captain came across a ship of Alexandria, sailing for Italy, and put us in it.
<br>27:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;一 连 多 日 ， 船 行 得 慢 ， 仅 仅 来 到 革 尼 土 的 对 面 。 因 为 被 风 拦 阻 ， 就 贴 着 革 哩 底 背 风 岸 ， 从 撒 摩 尼 对 面 行 过 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when we had gone on slowly for a long time, and had had hard work getting across to Cnidus, for the wind was against us, we went under cover of Crete, in the direction of Salmone;
<br>27:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 们 沿 岸 行 走 ， 仅 仅 来 到 一 个 地 方 ， 名 叫 佳 澳 。 离 那 里 不 远 ， 有 拉 西 亚 城 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And sailing down the side of it, as well as we were able, we came to a certain place named Fair Havens, near which was the town of Lasea.
<br>27:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;走 的 日 子 多 了 ， 已 经 过 了 禁 食 的 节 期 ， 行 船 又 危 险 ， 保 罗 就 劝 众 人 说 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And as a long time had gone by, and the journey was now full of danger, because it was late in the year, Paul put the position before them,
<br>27:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 位 ， 我 看 这 次 行 船 ， 不 但 货 物 和 船 要 受 伤 损 ， 大 遭 破 坏 ， 连 我 们 的 性 命 也 难 保 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Saying, Friends, I see that this journey will be one of great damage and loss, not only to the goods and the ship, but to ourselves.
<br>27:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 百 夫 长 信 从 掌 船 的 和 船 主 ， 不 信 从 保 罗 所 说 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But the captain gave more attention to the master and the owner of the ship than to what Paul said.
<br>27:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;且 因 在 这 海 口 过 冬 不 便 ， 船 上 的 人 ， 就 多 半 说 ， 不 如 开 船 离 开 这 地 方 ， 或 者 能 到 非 尼 基 过 冬 。 非 尼 基 是 革 哩 底 的 一 个 海 口 ， 一 面 朝 东 北 ， 一 面 朝 东 南 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And as the harbour was not a good one in which to be for the winter, the greater number of them were for going out to sea, in order, if possible, to put in for the winter at Phoenix, a harbour of Crete, looking to the north-east and south-east.
<br>27:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 时 微 微 起 了 南 风 ， 他 们 以 为 得 意 ， 就 起 了 锚 ， 贴 近 革 哩 底 行 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the south wind came softly, being of the opinion that their purpose might be effected, they let the ship go and went sailing down the side of Crete, very near to the land.
<br>27:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;不 多 几 时 ， 狂 风 从 岛 上 扑 下 来 ， 那 风 名 叫 友 拉 革 罗 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But after a little time, a very violent wind, named Euraquilo, came down from it with great force.
<br>27:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;船 被 风 抓 住 ， 敌 不 住 风 ， 我 们 就 任 风 刮 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the ship got into the grip of it, and was not able to make headway into the wind, we gave way, and went before it.
<br>27:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;贴 着 一 个 小 岛 的 背 风 岸 奔 行 ， 那 岛 名 叫 高 大 ， 在 那 里 仅 仅 收 住 了 小 船 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And, sailing near the side of a small island named Cauda, we were able, though it was hard work, to make the ship's boat safe:
<br>27:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;既 然 把 小 船 拉 上 来 ， 就 用 缆 索 捆 绑 船 底 。 又 恐 怕 在 赛 耳 底 沙 滩 上 搁 了 浅 ， 就 落 下 篷 来 ， 任 船 飘 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And having got it up, they put cords under and round the ship; but fearing that they might be pushed on to the Syrtis, they let down the sails and so went running before the wind.
<br>27:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 们 被 风 浪 逼 得 甚 急 ， 第 二 天 众 人 就 把 货 物 抛 在 海 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And, still fighting the storm with all our strength, the day after they made a start at getting the goods out of the ship;
<br>27:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;到 第 三 天 ， 他 们 又 亲 手 把 船 上 的 器 具 抛 弃 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And on the third day, they let all the sailing apparatus go over the side.
<br>27:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;太 阳 和 星 辰 多 日 不 显 露 ， 又 有 狂 风 大 浪 催 逼 ， 我 们 得 救 的 指 望 就 都 绝 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And as we had not seen the sun or stars for a long time, and a great storm was on us, all hope of salvation was gone.
<br>27:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 多 日 没 有 吃 什 么 ， 保 罗 就 出 来 站 在 他 们 中 间 说 ， 众 位 ， 你 们 本 该 听 我 的 话 ， 不 离 开 革 哩 底 ， 免 得 遭 这 样 的 伤 损 破 坏 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when they had been without food for a long time, Paul got up among them and said, Friends, it would have been better if you had given attention to me and not gone sailing out from Crete, to undergo this damage and loss.
<br>27:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;现 在 我 还 劝 你 们 放 心 。 你 们 的 性 命 ， 一 个 也 不 失 丧 ， 惟 独 失 丧 这 船 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But now, I say to you, be of good heart, for there will be no loss of life, but only of the ship.
<br>27:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 我 所 属 所 事 奉 的 神 ， 他 的 使 者 昨 夜 站 在 我 旁 边 说 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For this night there came to my side an angel of the God who is my Master and whose servant I am,
<br>27:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;保 罗 ， 不 要 害 怕 ， 你 必 定 站 在 该 撒 面 前 。 并 且 与 你 同 船 的 人 ， 神 都 赐 给 你 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Saying, Have no fear, Paul, for you will come before Caesar, and God has given to you all those who are sailing with you.
<br>27:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;所 以 众 位 可 以 放 心 ， 我 信 神 ， 他 怎 样 对 我 说 ， 事 情 也 要 怎 样 成 就 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And so, O men, be of good heart, for I have faith in God that it will be as he said to me.
<br>27:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;只 是 我 们 必 要 撞 在 一 个 岛 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But we will be sent on to a certain island.
<br>27:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;到 了 第 十 四 天 夜 间 ， 船 在 亚 底 亚 海 ， 飘 来 飘 去 ， 约 到 半 夜 ， 水 手 以 为 渐 近 旱 地 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But when the fourteenth day came, while we were going here and there in the Adriatic sea, about the middle of the night the sailors had an idea that they were getting near land;
<br>27:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 探 深 浅 ， 探 得 有 十 二 丈 ， 稍 往 前 行 ， 又 探 深 浅 ， 探 得 有 九 丈 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they let down the lead, and saw that the sea was a hundred and twenty feet deep; and after a little time they did it again and it was ninety feet.
<br>27:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;恐 怕 撞 在 石 头 上 ， 就 从 船 尾 抛 下 四 个 锚 ， 盼 望 天 亮 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then, fearing that by chance we might come on to the rocks, they let down four hooks from the back of the ship, and made prayers for the coming of day.
<br>27:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;水 手 想 要 逃 出 船 去 ， 把 小 船 放 在 海 里 ， 假 作 要 从 船 头 抛 锚 的 样 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then the sailors made attempts secretly to get away from the ship, letting down a boat as if they were about to put down hooks from the front of the ship;
<br>27:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;保 罗 对 百 夫 长 和 兵 丁 说 ， 这 些 人 若 不 等 在 船 上 ， 你 们 必 不 能 得 救 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Paul said to the captain and his men, If you do not keep these men in the ship, you will not be safe.
<br>27:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 兵 丁 砍 断 小 船 的 绳 子 ， 由 它 飘 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then the armed men, cutting the cords of the boat, let her go.
<br>27:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;天 渐 亮 的 时 候 保 罗 劝 众 人 都 吃 饭 ， 说 ， 你 们 悬 望 忍 饿 不 吃 什 么 ， 已 经 十 四 天 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when dawn was near, Paul gave them all orders to take food, saying, This is the fourteenth day you have been waiting and taking no food.
<br>27:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;所 以 我 劝 你 们 吃 饭 ， 这 是 关 乎 你 们 救 命 的 事 。 因 为 你 们 各 人 连 一 根 头 发 ， 也 不 至 于 损 坏 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So I make request to you to take food; for this is for your salvation: not a hair from the head of any of you will come to destruction.
<br>27:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;保 罗 说 了 这 话 ， 就 拿 着 饼 ， 在 众 人 面 前 祝 谢 了 神 ， 掰 开 吃 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he had said this and had taken bread, he gave praise to God before them all, and took a meal of the broken bread.
<br>27:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 他 们 都 放 下 心 ， 也 就 吃 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then they all took heart and did the same.
<br>27:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 们 在 船 上 的 ， 共 有 二 百 七 十 六 个 人
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And we were, in the ship, two hundred and seventy-six persons.
<br>27:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 吃 饱 了 ， 就 把 船 上 的 麦 子 ， 抛 在 海 里 ， 为 要 叫 船 轻 一 点 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when they had had enough food, they made the weight of the ship less, turning the grain out into the sea.
<br>27:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;到 了 天 亮 ， 他 们 不 认 识 那 地 方 ， 但 见 一 个 海 湾 ， 有 岸 可 登 ， 就 商 议 能 把 船 拢 进 去 不 能 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when it was day, they had no knowledge of the land, but they saw an inlet of the sea with a floor of sand, and they had the idea of driving the ship up on to it if possible.
<br>27:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 砍 断 缆 索 ， 弃 锚 在 海 里 ， 同 时 也 松 开 舵 绳 ， 拉 起 头 篷 ， 顺 着 风 向 岸 行 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So cutting away the hooks, and letting them go into the sea, and freeing the cords of the guiding-blades, and lifting up the sail to the wind, they went in the direction of the inlet.
<br>27:41&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 遇 着 两 水 夹 流 的 地 方 ， 就 把 船 搁 了 浅 。 船 头 胶 住 不 动 ， 船 尾 被 浪 的 猛 力 冲 坏 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And coming to a point between two seas, they got the ship to land; and the front part was fixed in the sand and not able to be moved, but the back part was broken by the force of the waves.
<br>27:42&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;兵 丁 的 意 思 ， 要 把 囚 犯 杀 了 ， 恐 怕 有 ？ ？ 水 脱 逃 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then the armed men were for putting the prisoners to death, so that no one would get away by swimming.
<br>27:43&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 百 夫 长 要 救 保 罗 ， 不 准 他 们 任 意 而 行 ， 就 吩 咐 会 ？ ？ 水 的 ， 跳 下 水 去 先 上 岸 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But the captain, desiring to keep Paul safe, kept them from their purpose, and gave orders that those who had knowledge of swimming were to go off the ship and get first to land:
<br>27:44&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;其 余 的 人 ， 可 以 用 板 子 ， 或 船 上 的 零 碎 东 西 上 岸 。 这 样 众 人 都 得 了 救 上 了 岸 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the rest, some on boards and some on things from the ship. And so it came about that they all got safe to land.
