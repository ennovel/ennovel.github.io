"Should you like towalk down to the river?"She seemed to listen to herself speaking from a far-off airyheight, and yet to be wholly gathered into the circle ofconsciousness which drew its glowing ring about herself andDarrow. To the aerial listener her words sounded flat andcolourless, but to the self within the ring each one beatwith a separate heart.</p> 
<p>　　It was the day after Darrow's arrival, and he had come downearly, drawn by the sweetness of the light on the lawns andgardens below his window. Anna had heard the echo of hisstep on the stairs, his pause in the stone- flagged hall,his voice as he asked a servant where to find her. She wasat the end of the house, in the brown-panelled sitting-roomwhich she frequented at that season because it caught thesunlight first and kept it longest. She stood near thewindow, in the pale band of brightness, arranging somesalmon-pink geraniums in a shallow porcelain bowl. Everysensation of touch and sight was thrice-alive in her. Thegrey- green fur of the geranium leaves caressed her fingersand the sunlight wavering across the irregular surface ofthe old parquet floor made it seem as bright and shifting asthe brown bed of a stream.</p> 
<p>　　Darrow stood framed in the door-way of the farthest drawing-room, a light-grey figure against the black and whiteflagging of the hall; then he began to move toward her downthe empty pale-panelled vista, crossing one after anotherthe long reflections which a projecting cabinet or screencast here and there upon the shining floors.</p> 
<p>　　As he drew nearer, his figure was suddenly displaced by thatof her husband, whom, from the same point, she had so oftenseen advancing down the same perspective. Straight, spare,erect, looking to right and left with quick precise turns ofthe head, and stopping now and then to straighten a chair oralter the position of a vase, Fraser Leath used to marchtoward her through the double file of furniture like ageneral reviewing a regiment drawn up for his inspection.</p> 
<p>　　At a certain point, midway across the second room, he alwaysstopped before the mantel-piece of pinkish-yellow marble andlooked at himself in the tall garlanded glass thatsurmounted it. She could not remember that he had everfound anything to straighten or alter in his own studiedattire, but she had never known him to omit the inspectionwhen he passed that particular mirror.</p> 
<p>　　When it was over he continued more briskly on his way, andthe resulting expression of satisfaction was still on hisface when he entered the oak sitting-room to greet hiswife...</p> 
<p>　　The spectral projection of this little daily scene hung butfor a moment before Anna, but in that moment she had time tofling a wondering glance across the distance between herpast and present. Then the footsteps of the present cameclose, and she had to drop the geraniums to give her hand toDarrow...</p> 
<p>　　"Yes, let us walk down to the river."They had neither of them, as yet, found much to say to eachother. Darrow had arrived late on the previous afternoon,and during the evening they had had between them Owen Leathand their own thoughts. Now they were alone for the firsttime and the fact was enough in itself. Yet Anna wasintensely aware that as soon as they began to talk moreintimately they would feel that they knew each other lesswell.</p> 
<p>　　They passed out onto the terrace and down the steps to thegravel walk below. The delicate frosting of dew gave thegrass a bluish shimmer, and the sunlight, sliding in emeraldstreaks along the tree-boles, gathered itself into greatluminous blurs at the end of the wood-walks, and hung abovethe fields a watery glory like the ring about an autumnmoon.</p> 
<p>　　"It's good to be here," Darrow said.</p> 
<p>　　They took a turn to the left and stopped for a moment tolook back at the long pink house-front, plainer, friendlier,less adorned than on the side toward the court. Soprolonged yet delicate had been the friction of time uponits bricks that certain expanses had the bloom and textureof old red velvet, and the patches of gold lichen spreadingover them looked like the last traces of a dim embroidery.</p> 
<p>　　The dome of the chapel, with its gilded cross, rose aboveone wing, and the other ended in a conical pigeon-house,above which the birds were flying, lustrous and slatey,their breasts merged in the blue of the roof when theydropped down on it.</p> 
<p>　　"And this is where you've been all these years."They turned away and began to walk down a long tunnel ofyellowing trees. Benches with mossy feet stood against themossy edges of the path, and at its farther end it widenedinto a circle about a basin rimmed with stone, in which theopaque water strewn with leaves looked like a slab of gold-flecked agate. The path, growing narrower, wound oncircuitously through the woods, between slender serriedtrunks twined with ivy. Patches of blue appeared above themthrough the dwindling leaves, and presently the trees drewback and showed the open fields along the river.</p> 
<p>　　They walked on across the fields to the tow-path. In acurve of the wall some steps led up to a crumbling pavilionwith openings choked with ivy. Anna and Darrow seatedthemselves on the bench projecting from the inner wall ofthe pavilion and looked across the river at the slopesdivided into blocks of green and fawn-colour, and at thechalk-tinted village lifting its squat church-tower and greyroofs against the precisely drawn lines of the landscape.</p> 
<p>　　Anna sat silent, so intensely aware of Darrow's nearnessthat there was no surprise in the touch he laid on her hand.</p> 
<p>　　They looked at each other, and he smiled and said: "Thereare to be no more obstacles now.""Obstacles?" The word startled her. "What obstacles?""Don't you remember the wording of the telegram that turnedme back last May? 'Unforeseen obstacle': that was it. Whatwas the earth-shaking problem, by the way? Finding agoverness for Effie, wasn't it?""But I gave you my reason: the reason why it was anobstacle. I wrote you fully about it.""Yes, I know you did." He lifted her hand and kissed it.</p> 
<p>　　"How far off it all seems, and how little it all matterstoday!"She looked at him quickly. "Do you feel that? I suppose I'mdifferent. I want to draw all those wasted months intotoday--to make them a part of it.""But they are, to me. You reach back and take everything--back to the first days of all."She frowned a little, as if struggling with an inarticulateperplexity. "It's curious how, in those first days, too,something that I didn't understand came between us.""Oh, in those days we neither of us understood, did we? It'spart of what's called the bliss of being young.""Yes, I thought that, too: thought it, I mean, in lookingback. But it couldn't, even then, have been as true of youas of me; and now----""Now," he said, "the only thing that matters is that we'resitting here together."He dismissed the rest with a lightness that might haveseemed conclusive evidence of her power over him. But shetook no pride in such triumphs. It seemed to her that shewanted his allegiance and his adoration not so much forherself as for their mutual love, and that in treatinglightly any past phase of their relation he took somethingfrom its present beauty. The colour rose to her face.</p> 
<p>　　"Between you and me everything matters.""Of course!" She felt the unperceiving sweetness of hissmile. "That's why," he went on, "'everything,' for me, ishere and now: on this bench, between you and me."She caught at the phrase. "That's what I meant: it's hereand now; we can't get away from it.""Get away from it? Do you want to? AGAIN?"Her heart was beating unsteadily. Something in her,fitfully and with reluctance, struggled to free itself, butthe warmth of his nearness penetrated every sense as thesunlight steeped the landscape. Then, suddenly, she feltthat she wanted no less than the whole of her happiness.</p> 
<p>　　"'Again'? But wasn't it YOU, the last time----?"She paused, the tremor in her of Psyche holding up the lamp.</p> 
<p>　　But in the interrogative light of her pause her companion'sfeatures underwent no change.</p> 
<p>　　"The last time? Last spring? But it was you who--for thebest of reasons, as you've told me--turned me back from yourvery door last spring!"She saw that he was good-humouredly ready to "thresh out,"for her sentimental satisfaction, a question which, for hisown, Time had so conclusively dealt with; and the sense ofhis readiness reassured her.</p> 
<p>　　"I wrote as soon as I could," she rejoined. "I explainedthe delay and asked you to come. And you never evenanswered my letter.""It was impossible to come then. I had to go back to mypost.""And impossible to write and tell me so?""Your letter was a long time coming. I had waited a week--ten days. I had some excuse for thinking, when it came,that you were in no great hurry for an answer.""You thought that--really--after reading it?""I thought it."Her heart leaped up to her throat. "Then why are you heretoday?"He turned on her with a quick look of wonder. "God knows--if you can ask me that!""You see I was right to say I didn't understand."He stood up abruptly and stood facing her, blocking the viewover the river and the checkered slopes. "Perhaps I mightsay so too.""No, no: we must neither of us have any reason for saying itagain." She looked at him gravely. "Surely you and Ineedn't arrange the lights before we show ourselves to eachother. I want you to see me just as I am, with all myirrational doubts and scruples; the old ones and the newones too."He came back to his seat beside her. "Never mind the oldones. They were justified--I'm willing to admit it. Withthe governess having suddenly to be packed off, and Effie onyour hands, and your mother-in-law ill, I see theimpossibility of your letting me come. I even see that, atthe moment, it was difficult to write and explain. But whatdoes all that matter now? The new scruples are the ones Iwant to tackle."Again her heart trembled. She felt her happiness so near,so sure, that to strain it closer might be like a child'scrushing a pet bird in its caress. But her very securityurged her on. For so long her doubts had been knife-edged:</p> 
<p>　　now they had turned into bright harmless toys that she couldtoss and catch without peril!</p> 
<p>　　"You didn't come, and you didn't answer my letter; and afterwaiting four months I wrote another.""And I answered that one; and I'm here.""Yes." She held his eyes. "But in my last letter I repeatedexactly what I'd said in the first--the one I wrote you lastJune. I told you then that I was ready to give you theanswer to what you'd asked me in London; and in telling youthat, I told you what the answer was.""My dearest! My dearest!" Darrow murmured.</p> 
<p>　　"You ignored that letter. All summer you made no sign. Andall I ask now is, that you should frankly tell me why.""I can only repeat what I've just said. I was hurt andunhappy and I doubted you. I suppose if I'd cared less Ishould have been more confident. I cared so much that Icouldn't risk another failure. For you'd made me feel thatI'd miserably failed. So I shut my eyes and set my teethand turned my back. There's the whole pusillanimous truthof it!""Oh, if it's the WHOLE truth!----" She let him claspher. "There's my torment, you see. I thought that was whatyour silence meant till I made you break it. Now I want tobe sure that I was right.""What can I tell you to make you sure?""You can let me tell YOU everything first." She drewaway, but without taking her hands from him. "Owen saw youin Paris," she began.</p> 
<p>　　She looked at him and he faced her steadily. The light wasfull on his pleasantly-browned face, his grey eyes, hisfrank white forehead. She noticed for the first time aseal-ring in a setting of twisted silver on the hand he hadkept on hers.</p> 
<p>　　"In Paris? Oh, yes...So he did.""He came back and told me. I think you talked to him amoment in a theatre. I asked if you'd spoken of my havingput you off--or if you'd sent me any message. He didn'tremember that you had.""In a crush--in a Paris foyer? My dear!""It was absurd of me! But Owen and I have always been on oddkind of brother-and-sister terms. I think he guessed aboutus when he saw you with me in London. So he teased me alittle and tried to make me curious about you; and when hesaw he'd succeeded he told me he hadn't had time to say muchto you because you were in such a hurry to get back to thelady you were with."He still held her hands, but she felt no tremor in his, andthe blood did not stir in his brown cheek. He seemed to behonestly turning over his memories.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes: and what else did he tell you?""Oh, not much, except that she was awfully pretty. When Iasked him to describe her he said you had her tucked away ina baignoire and he hadn't actually seen her; but he saw thetail of her cloak, and somehow knew from that that she waspretty. One DOES, you know...I think he said the cloakwas pink."Darrow broke into a laugh. "Of course it was--they alwaysare! So that was at the bottom of your doubts?""Not at first. I only laughed. But afterward, when I wroteyou and you didn't answer----Oh, you DO see?" sheappealed to him.</p> 
<p>　　He was looking at her gently. "Yes: I see.""It's not as if this were a light thing between us. I wantyou to know me as I am. If I thought that at thatmoment...when you were on your way here, almost----"He dropped her hand and stood up. "Yes, yes--I understand.""But do you?" Her look followed him. "I'm not a goose of agirl. I know...of course I KNOW...but there are thingsa woman feels...when what she knows doesn't make anydifference. It's not that I want you to explain--I meanabout that particular evening. It's only that I want you tohave the whole of my feeling. I didn't know what it wastill I saw you again. I never dreamed I should say suchthings to you!""I never dreamed I should be here to hear you say them!" Heturned back and lifting a floating end of her scarf put hislips to it. "But now that you have, I know--I know," hesmiled down at her.</p> 
<p>　　"You know?""That this is no light thing between us. Now you may ask meanything you please! That was all I wanted to ask YOU."For a long moment they looked at each other withoutspeaking. She saw the dancing spirit in his eyes turn graveand darken to a passionate sternness. He stooped and kissedher, and she sat as if folded in wings.</p>
