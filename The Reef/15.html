<p>　　Effie was to pay for her morning's holiday by an hour or twoin the school-room, and Owen suggested that he and Darrowshould betake themselves to a distant covert in thedesultory quest for pheasants.</p> 
<p>　　Darrow was not an ardent sportsman, but any pretext forphysical activity would have been acceptable at the moment;and he was glad both to get away from the house and not tobe left to himself.</p> 
<p>　　When he came downstairs the motor was at the door, and Annastood before the hall mirror, swathing her hat in veils.</p> 
<p>　　She turned at the sound of his step and smiled at him for along full moment.</p> 
<p>　　"I'd no idea you knew Miss Viner," she said, as he helpedher into her long coat.</p> 
<p>　　"It came back to me, luckily, that I'd seen her two or threetimes in London, several years ago. She was secretary, orsomething of the sort, in the background of a house where Iused to dine."He loathed the slighting indifference of the phrase, but hehad uttered it deliberately, had been secretly practising itall through the interminable hour at the luncheon-table.</p> 
<p>　　Now that it was spoken, he shivered at its note ofcondescension. In such cases one was almost sure tooverdo...But Anna seemed to notice nothing unusual.</p> 
<p>　　"Was she really? You must tell me all about it--tell meexactly how she struck you. I'm so glad it turns out thatyou know her.""'Know' is rather exaggerated: we used to pass each other onthe stairs."Madame de Chantelle and Owen appeared together as he spoke,and Anna, gathering up her wraps, said: "You'll tell meabout that, then. Try and remember everything you can."As he tramped through the woods at his young host's side,Darrow felt the partial relief from thought produced byexercise and the obligation to talk. Little as he cared forshooting, he had the habit of concentration which makes itnatural for a man to throw himself wholly into whateverbusiness he has in hand, and there were moments of theafternoon when a sudden whirr in the undergrowth, a vividergleam against the hazy browns and greys of the woods, wasenough to fill the foreground of his attention. But all thewhile, behind these voluntarily emphasized sensations, hissecret consciousness continued to revolve on a loud wheel ofthought. For a time it seemed to be sweeping him throughdeep gulfs of darkness. His sensations were too swift andswarming to be disentangled. He had an almost physicalsense of struggling for air, of battling helplessly withmaterial obstructions, as though the russet covert throughwhich he trudged were the heart of a maleficent jungle...</p> 
<p>　　Snatches of his companion's talk drifted to himintermittently through the confusion of his thoughts. Hecaught eager self-revealing phrases, and understood thatOwen was saying things about himself, perhaps hintingindirectly at the hopes for which Darrow had been preparedby Anna's confidences. He had already become aware that thelad liked him, and had meant to take the first opportunityof showing that he reciprocated the feeling. But the effortof fixing his attention on Owen's words was so great that itleft no power for more than the briefest and mostinexpressive replies.</p> 
<p>　　Young Leath, it appeared, felt that he had reached aturning-point in his career, a height from which he couldimpartially survey his past progress and projectedendeavour. At one time he had had musical and literaryyearnings, visions of desultory artistic indulgence; butthese had of late been superseded by the resolutedetermination to plunge into practical life.</p> 
<p>　　"I don't want, you see," Darrow heard him explaining, "todrift into what my grandmother, poor dear, is trying to makeof me: an adjunct of Givre. I don't want--hang it all!--toslip into collecting sensations as my father collectedsnuff-boxes. I want Effie to have Givre--it's mygrandmother's, you know, to do as she likes with; and I'veunderstood lately that if it belonged to me it wouldgradually gobble me up. I want to get out of it, into alife that's big and ugly and struggling. If I can extractbeauty out of THAT, so much the better: that'll prove myvocation. But I want to MAKE beauty, not be drowned inthe ready-made, like a bee in a pot of honey."Darrow knew that he was being appealed to for corroborationof these views and for encouragement in the course to whichthey pointed. To his own ears his answers sounded now curt,now irrelevant: at one moment he seemed chillinglyindifferent, at another he heard himself launching out on aflood of hazy discursiveness. He dared not look at Owen,for fear of detecting the lad's surprise at these senselesstransitions. And through the confusion of his inwardstruggles and outward loquacity he heard the ceaseless trip-hammer beat of the question: "What in God's name shall Ido?"...</p> 
<p>　　To get back to the house before Anna's return seemed hismost pressing necessity. He did not clearly know why: hesimply felt that he ought to be there. At one moment itoccurred to him that Miss Viner might want to speak to himalone--and again, in the same flash, that it would probablybe the last thing she would want...At any rate, he felt heought to try to speak to HER; or at least be prepared todo so, if the chance should occur...</p> 
<p>　　Finally, toward four, he told his companion that he had someletters on his mind and must get back to the house anddespatch them before the ladies returned. He left Owen withthe beater and walked on to the edge of the covert. At thepark gates he struck obliquely through the trees, followinga grass avenue at the end of which he had caught a glimpseof the roof of the chapel. A grey haze had blotted out thesun and the still air clung about him tepidly. At lengththe house-front raised before him its expanse of damp-silvered brick, and he was struck afresh by the high decorumof its calm lines and soberly massed surfaces. It made himfeel, in the turbid coil of his fears and passions, like amuddy tramp forcing his way into some pure sequesteredshrine...</p> 
<p>　　By and bye, he knew, he should have to think the complexhorror out, slowly, systematically, bit by bit; but for themoment it was whirling him about so fast that he could justclutch at its sharp spikes and be tossed off again. Onlyone definite immediate fact stuck in his quivering grasp.</p> 
<p>　　He must give the girl every chance--must hold himselfpassive till she had taken them...</p> 
<p>　　In the court Effie ran up to him with her leaping terrier.</p> 
<p>　　"I was coming out to meet you--you and Owen. Miss Viner wascoming, too, and then she couldn't because she's got such aheadache. I'm afraid I gave it to her because I did mydivision so disgracefully. It's too bad, isn't it? Butwon't you walk back with me? Nurse won't mind the least bit;she'd so much rather go in to tea."Darrow excused himself laughingly, on the plea that he hadletters to write, which was much worse than having aheadache, and not infrequently resulted in one.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, then you can go and write them in Owen's study. That'swhere gentlemen always write their letters."She flew on with her dog and Darrow pursued his way to thehouse. Effie's suggestion struck him as useful. He hadpictured himself as vaguely drifting about the drawing-rooms, and had perceived the difficulty of Miss Viner'shaving to seek him there; but the study, a small room on theright of the hall, was in easy sight from the staircase, andso situated that there would be nothing marked in his beingfound there in talk with her.</p> 
<p>　　He went in, leaving the door open, and sat down at thewriting-table. The room was a friendly heterogeneous place,the one repository, in the well-ordered and amply-servantedhouse, of all its unclassified odds and ends: Effie'scroquet-box and fishing rods, Owen's guns and golf-sticksand racquets, his step-mother's flower-baskets and gardeningimplements, even Madame de Chantelle's embroidery frame, andthe back numbers of the Catholic Weekly. The early twilighthad begun to fall, and presently a slanting ray across thedesk showed Darrow that a servant was coming across the hallwith a lamp. He pulled out a sheet of note-paper and beganto write at random, while the man, entering, put the lamp athis elbow and vaguely "straightened" the heap of newspaperstossed on the divan. Then his steps died away and Darrowsat leaning his head on his locked hands.</p> 
<p>　　Presently another step sounded on the stairs, wavered amoment and then moved past the threshold of the study.</p> 
<p>　　Darrow got up and walked into the hall, which was stillunlighted. In the dimness he saw Sophy Viner standing bythe hall door in her hat and jacket. She stopped at sightof him, her hand on the door-bolt, and they stood for asecond without speaking.</p> 
<p>　　"Have you seen Effie?" she suddenly asked. "She went out tomeet you.""She DID meet me, just now, in the court. She's gone onto join her brother."Darrow spoke as naturally as he could, but his voice soundedto his own ears like an amateur actor's in a "light" part.</p> 
<p>　　Miss Viner, without answering, drew back the bolt. Hewatched her in silence as the door swung open; then he said:</p> 
<p>　　"She has hernurse with her. She won't be long."She stood irresolute, and he added: "I was writing in there--won't you come and have a little talk? Every one's out."The last words struck him as not well-chosen, but there wasno time to choose. She paused a second longer and thencrossed the threshold of the study. At luncheon she had satwith her back to the window, and beyond noting that she hadgrown a little thinner, and had less colour and vivacity, hehad seen no change in her; but now, as the lamplight fell onher face, its whiteness startled him.</p> 
<p>　　"Poor thing...poor thing...what in heaven's name can shesuppose?" he wondered.</p> 
<p>　　"Do sit down--I want to talk to you," he said and pushed achair toward her.</p> 
<p>　　She did not seem to see it, or, if she did, she deliberatelychose another seat. He came back to his own chair andleaned his elbows on the blotter. She faced him from thefarther side of the table.</p> 
<p>　　"You promised to let me hear from you now and then," hebegan awkwardly, and with a sharp sense of his awkwardness.</p> 
<p>　　A faint smile made her face more tragic. "Did I? There wasnothing to tell. I've had no history--like the happycountries..."He waited a moment before asking: "You ARE happy here?""I WAS," she said with a faint emphasis.</p> 
<p>　　"Why do you say 'was'? You're surely not thinking of going?</p> 
<p>　　There can't be kinder people anywhere." Darrow hardly knewwhat he was saying; but her answer came to him with deadlydefiniteness.</p> 
<p>　　"I suppose it depends on you whether I go or stay.""On me?" He stared at her across Owen's scattered papers.</p> 
<p>　　"Good God! What can you think of me, to say that?"The mockery of the question flashed back at him from herwretched face. She stood up, wandered away, and leaned aninstant in the darkening window-frame. From there sheturned to fling back at him: "Don't imagine I'm the leastbit sorry for anything!"He steadied his elbows on the table and hid his face in hishands. It was harder, oh, damnably harder, than he hadexpected! Arguments, expedients, palliations, evasions, allseemed to be slipping away from him: he was left face toface with the mere graceless fact of his inferiority. Helifted his head to ask at random: "You've been here, then,ever since?""Since June; yes. It turned out that the Farlows werehunting for me--all the while--for this."She stood facing him, her back to the window, evidentlyimpatient to be gone, yet with something still to say, orthat she expected to hear him say. The sense of herexpectancy benumbed him. What in heaven's name could he sayto her that was not an offense or a mockery?</p> 
<p>　　"Your idea of the theatre--you gave that up at once, then?""Oh, the theatre!" She gave a little laugh. "I couldn'twait for the theatre. I had to take the first thing thatoffered; I took this."He pushed on haltingly: "I'm glad--extremely glad--you'rehappy here...I'd counted on your letting me know if therewas anything I could do...The theatre, now--if you stillregret it--if you're not contented here...I know people inthat line in London--I'm certain I can manage it for youwhen I get back----"She moved up to the table and leaned over it to ask, in avoice that was hardly above a whisper: "Then you DO wantme to leave? Is that it?"He dropped his arms with a groan. "Good heavens! How canyou think such things? At the time, you know, I begged youto let me do what I could, but you wouldn't hear of it...andever since I've been wanting to be of use--to do something,anything, to help you..."She heard him through, motionless, without a quiver of theclasped hands she rested on the edge of the table.</p> 
<p>　　"If you want to help me, then--you can help me to stayhere," she brought out with low-toned intensity.</p> 
<p>　　Through the stillness of the pause which followed, the brayof a motor-horn sounded far down the drive. Instantly sheturned, with a last white look at him, and fled from theroom and up the stairs. He stood motionless, benumbed bythe shock of her last words. She was afraid, then--afraidof him--sick with fear of him! The discovery beat him downto a lower depth...</p> 
<p>　　The motor-horn sounded again, close at hand, and he turnedand went up to his room. His letter-writing was asufficient pretext for not immediately joining the partyabout the tea-table, and he wanted to be alone and try toput a little order into his tumultuous thinking.</p> 
<p>　　Upstairs, the room held out the intimate welcome of its lampand fire. Everything in it exhaled the same sense of peaceand stability which, two evenings before, had lulled him tocomplacent meditation. His armchair again invited him fromthe hearth, but he was too agitated to sit still, and withsunk head and hands clasped behind his back he began towander up and down the room.</p> 
<p>　　His five minutes with Sophy Viner had flashed strange lightsinto the shadowy corners of his consciousness. The girl'sabsolute candour, her hard ardent honesty, was for themoment the vividest point in his thoughts. He wondered anew,as he had wondered before, at the way in which the harshdiscipline of life had stripped her of false sentimentwithout laying the least touch on her pride. When they hadparted, five months before, she had quietly but decidedlyrejected all his offers of help, even to the suggestion ofhis trying to further her theatrical aims: she had made itclear that she wished their brief alliance to leave no traceon their lives save that of its own smiling memory. But nowthat they were unexpectedly confronted in a situation whichseemed, to her terrified fancy, to put her at his mercy, herfirst impulse was to defend her right to the place she hadwon, and to learn as quickly as possible if he meant todispute it. While he had pictured her as shrinking awayfrom him in a tremor of self-effacement she had watched hismovements, made sure of her opportunity, and come straightdown to "have it out" with him. He was so struck by thefrankness and energy of the proceeding that for a moment helost sight of the view of his own character implied in it.</p> 
<p>　　"Poor thing...poor thing!" he could only go on saying; andwith the repetition of the words the picture of himself asshe must see him pitiably took shape again.</p> 
<p>　　He understood then, for the first time, how vague, incomparison with hers, had been his own vision of the part hehad played in the brief episode of their relation. Theincident had left in him a sense of exasperation and self-contempt, but that, as he now perceived, was chiefly, if notaltogether, as it bore on his preconceived ideal of hisattitude toward another woman. He had fallen below his ownstandard of sentimental loyalty, and if he thought of SophyViner it was mainly as the chance instrument of his lapse.</p> 
<p>　　These considerations were not agreeable to his pride, butthey were forced on him by the example of her valiantcommon-sense. If he had cut a sorry figure in the business,he owed it to her not to close his eyes to the fact anylonger...</p> 
<p>　　But when he opened them, what did he see? The situation,detestable at best, would yet have been relatively simple ifprotecting Sophy Viner had been the only duty involved init. The fact that that duty was paramount did not do awaywith the contingent obligations. It was Darrow's instinct,in difficult moments, to go straight to the bottom of thedifficulty; but he had never before had to take so dark adive as this, and for the minute he shivered on thebrink...Well, his first duty, at any rate, was to the girl:</p> 
<p>　　he must let her see that he meant to fulfill it to the lastjot, and then try to find out how to square the fulfillmentwith the other problems already in his path...</p>
