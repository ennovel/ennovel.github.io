<p>　　The wind flung about the stripped tree-tops of the avenueand dashed the stinging streams into his face. He walked tothe gate and then turned into the high-road and strode alongin the open, buffeted by slanting gusts. The evenly ridgedfields were a blurred waste of mud, and the russet covertswhich he and Owen had shot through the day before shivereddesolately against a driving sky.</p> 
<p>　　Darrow walked on and on, indifferent to the direction he wastaking. His thoughts were tossing like the tree-tops.</p> 
<p>　　Anna's announcement had not come to him as a completesurprise: that morning, as he strolled back to the housewith Owen Leath and Miss Viner, he had had a momentaryintuition of the truth. But it had been no more than anintuition, the merest faint cloud-puff of surmise; and nowit was an attested fact, darkening over the whole sky.</p> 
<p>　　In respect of his own attitude, he saw at once that thediscovery made no appreciable change. If he had been boundto silence before, he was no less bound to it now; the onlydifference lay in the fact that what he had just learned hadrendered his bondage more intolerable. Hitherto he had feltfor Sophy Viner's defenseless state a sympathy profoundlytinged with compunction. But now he was half-conscious ofan obscure indignation against her. Superior as he hadfancied himself to ready-made judgments, he was aware ofcherishing the common doubt as to the disinterestedness ofthe woman who tries to rise above her past. No wonder shehad been sick with fear on meeting him! It was in his powerto do her more harm than he had dreamed...</p> 
<p>　　Assuredly he did not want to harm her; but he diddesperately want to prevent her marrying Owen Leath. Hetried to get away from the feeling, to isolate andexteriorize it sufficiently to see what motives it was madeof; but it remained a mere blind motion of his blood, theinstinctive recoil from the thing that no amount of arguingcan make "straight." His tramp, prolonged as it was, carriedhim no nearer to enlightenment; and after trudging throughtwo or three sallow mud-stained villages he turned about andwearily made his way back to Givre. As he walked up theblack avenue, making for the lights that twinkled throughits pitching branches, he had a sudden realisation of hisutter helplessness. He might think and combine as he would;but there was nothing, absolutely nothing, that he coulddo...</p> 
<p>　　He dropped his wet coat in the vestibule and began to mountthe stairs to his room. But on the landing he was overtakenby a sober-faced maid who, in tones discreetly lowered,begged him to be so kind as to step, for a moment, into theMarquise's sitting-room. Somewhat disconcerted by thesummons, he followed its bearer to the door at which, acouple of hours earlier, he had taken leave of Mrs. Leath.</p> 
<p>　　It opened to admit him to a large lamp-lit room which heimmediately perceived to be empty; and the fact gave himtime to note, even through his disturbance of mind, theinteresting degree to which Madame de Chantelle's apartment"dated" and completed her. Its looped and corded curtains,its purple satin upholstery, the Sevres jardinieres, therosewood fire-screen, the little velvet tables edged withlace and crowded with silver knick-knacks and simperingminiatures, reconstituted an almost perfect setting for theblonde beauty of the 'sixties. Darrow wondered that FraserLeath's filial respect should have prevailed over hisaesthetic scruples to the extent of permitting such ananachronism among the eighteenth century graces of Givre;but a moment's reflection made it clear that, to its lateowner, the attitude would have seemed exactly in thetraditions of the place.</p> 
<p>　　Madame de Chantelle's emergence from an inner room snatchedDarrow from these irrelevant musings. She was alreadybeaded and bugled for the evening, and, save for a slightpinkness of the eye-lids, her elaborate appearance revealedno mark of agitation; but Darrow noticed that, inrecognition of the solemnity of the occasion, she pinched alace handkerchief between her thumb and forefinger.</p> 
<p>　　She plunged at once into the centre of the difficulty,appealing to him, in the name of all the Everards, todescend there with her to the rescue of her darling. Shewasn't, she was sure, addressing herself in vain to onewhose person, whose "tone," whose traditions so brilliantlydeclared his indebtedness to the principles she besought himto defend. Her own reception of Darrow, the confidence shehad at once accorded him, must have shown him that she hadinstinctively felt their unanimity of sentiment on thesefundamental questions. She had in fact recognized in himthe one person whom, without pain to her maternal piety, shecould welcome as her son's successor; and it was almost asto Owen's father that she now appealed to Darrow to aid inrescuing the wretched boy.</p> 
<p>　　"Don't think, please, that I'm casting the least reflectionon Anna, or showing any want of sympathy for her, when I saythat I consider her partly responsible for what's happened.</p> 
<p>　　Anna is 'modern'--I believe that's what it's called when youread unsettling books and admire hideous pictures. Indeed,"Madame de Chantelle continued, leaning confidentiallyforward, "I myself have always more or less lived in thatatmosphere: my son, you know, was very revolutionary. Onlyhe didn't, of course, apply his ideas: they were purelyintellectual. That's what dear Anna has always failed tounderstand. And I'm afraid she's created the same kind ofconfusion in Owen's mind--led him to mix up things you readabout with things you do...You know, of course, that shesides with him in this wretched business?"Developing at length upon this theme, she finally narroweddown to the point of Darrow's intervention. "My grandson,Mr. Darrow, calls me illogical and uncharitable because myfeelings toward Miss Viner have changed since I've heardthis news. Well! You've known her, it appears, for someyears: Anna tells me you used to see her when she was acompanion, or secretary or something, to a dreadfully vulgarMrs. Murrett. And I ask you as a friend, I ask you as oneof US, to tell me if you think a girl who has had toknock about the world in that kind of position, and at theorders of all kinds of people, is fitted to be Owen's wifeI'm not implying anything against her! I LIKED the girl,Mr. Darrow...But what's that got to do with it? I don't wanther to marry my grandson. If I'd been looking for a wifefor Owen, I shouldn't have applied to the Farlows to find meone. That's what Anna won't understand; and what you musthelp me to make her see."Darrow, to this appeal, could oppose only the repeatedassurance of his inability to interfere. He tried to makeMadame de Chantelle see that the very position he hoped totake in the household made his intervention the morehazardous. He brought up the usual arguments, and soundedthe expected note of sympathy; but Madame de Chantelle'salarm had dispelled her habitual imprecision, and, thoughshe had not many reasons to advance, her argument clung toits point like a frightened sharp-clawed animal.</p> 
<p>　　"Well, then," she summed up, in response to his repeatedassertions that he saw no way of helping her, "you can, atleast, even if you won't say a word to the others, tell mefrankly and fairly--and quite between ourselves--yourpersonal opinion of Miss Viner, since you've known her somuch longer than we have."He protested that, if he had known her longer, he had knownher much less well, and that he had already, on this point,convinced Anna of his inability to pronounce an opinion.</p> 
<p>　　Madame de Chantelle drew a deep sigh of intelligence. "Youropinion of Mrs. Murrett is enough! I don't suppose youpretend to conceal THAT? And heaven knows what otherunspeakable people she's been mixed up with. The onlyfriends she can produce are called Hoke...Don't try toreason with me, Mr. Darrow. There are feelings that godeeper than facts...And I KNOW she thought of studyingfor the stage..." Madame de Chantelle raised the corner ofher lace handkerchief to her eyes. "I'm old-fashioned--likemy furniture," she murmured. "And I thought I could counton you, Mr. Darrow..."When Darrow, that night, regained his room, he reflectedwith a flash of irony that each time he entered it hebrought a fresh troop of perplexities to trouble its sereneseclusion. Since the day after his arrival, only forty-eight hours before, when he had set his window open to thenight, and his hopes had seemed as many as its stars, eachevening had brought its new problem and its reneweddistress. But nothing, as yet, had approached the blankmisery of mind with which he now set himself to face thefresh questions confronting him.</p> 
<p>　　Sophy Viner had not shown herself at dinner, so that he hadhad no glimpse of her in her new character, and no means ofdivining the real nature of the tie between herself and OwenLeath. One thing, however, was clear: whatever her realfeelings were, and however much or little she had at stake,if she had made up her mind to marry Owen she had more thanenough skill and tenacity to defeat any arts that poorMadame de Chantelle could oppose to her.</p> 
<p>　　Darrow himself was in fact the only person who mightpossibly turn her from her purpose: Madame de Chantelle, athaphazard, had hit on the surest means of saving Owen--if toprevent his marriage were to save him! Darrow, on thispoint, did not pretend to any fixed opinion; one feelingalone was clear and insistent in him: he did not mean, if hecould help it, to let the marriage take place.</p> 
<p>　　How he was to prevent it he did not know: to his tormentedimagination every issue seemed closed. For a fantasticinstant he was moved to follow Madame de Chantelle'ssuggestion and urge Anna to withdraw her approval. If hisreticence, his efforts to avoid the subject, had not escapedher, she had doubtless set them down to the fact of hisknowing more, and thinking less, of Sophy Viner than he hadbeen willing to admit; and he might take advantage of thisto turn her mind gradually from the project. Yet how do sowithout betraying his insincerity? If he had had nothing tohide he could easily have said: "It's one thing to knownothing against the girl, it's another to pretend that Ithink her a good match for Owen." But could he say even somuch without betraying more? It was not Anna's questions, orhis answers to them, that he feared, but what might cryaloud in the intervals between them. He understood now thatever since Sophy Viner's arrival at Givre he had felt inAnna the lurking sense of something unexpressed, and perhapsinexpressible, between the girl and himself...When at lasthe fell asleep he had fatalistically committed his next stepto the chances of the morrow.</p> 
<p>　　The first that offered itself was an encounter with Mrs.</p> 
<p>　　Leath as he descended the stairs the next morning. She hadcome down already hatted and shod for a dash to the parklodge, where one of the gatekeeper's children had had anaccident. In her compact dark dress she looked more thanusually straight and slim, and her face wore the pale glowit took on at any call on her energy: a kind of warriorbrightness that made her small head, with its strong chinand close-bound hair, like that of an amazon in a frieze.</p> 
<p>　　It was their first moment alone since she had left him, theafternoon before, at her mother-in-law's door; and after afew words about the injured child their talk inevitablyreverted to Owen.</p> 
<p>　　Anna spoke with a smile of her "scene" with Madame deChantelle, who belonged, poor dear, to a generation when"scenes" (in the ladylike and lachrymal sense of the term)were the tribute which sensibility was expected to pay tothe unusual. Their conversation had been, in every detail,so exactly what Anna had foreseen that it had clearly notmade much impression on her; but she was eager to know theresult of Darrow's encounter with her mother-in-law.</p> 
<p>　　"She told me she'd sent for you: she always 'sends for'</p> 
<p>　　people in emergencies. That again, I suppose, is del'epoque. And failing Adelaide Painter, who can't get heretill this afternoon, there was no one but poor you to turnto."She put it all lightly, with a lightness that seemed to histight-strung nerves slightly, undefinably over-done. But hewas so aware of his own tension that he wondered, the nextmoment, whether anything would ever again seem to him quiteusual and insignificant and in the common order of things.</p> 
<p>　　As they hastened on through the drizzle in which the stormof the night was weeping itself out, Anna drew close underhis umbrella, and at the pressure of her arm against his herecalled his walk up the Dover pier with Sophy Viner. Thememory gave him a startled vision of the inevitableoccasions of contact, confidence, familiarity, which hisfuture relationship to the girl would entail, and thecountless chances of betrayal that every one of theminvolved.</p> 
<p>　　"Do tell me just what you said," he heard Anna pleading; andwith sudden resolution he affirmed: "I quite understand yourmother-in-law's feeling as she does."The words, when uttered, seemed a good deal less significantthan they had sounded to his inner ear; and Anna repliedwithout surprise: "Of course. It's inevitable that sheshould. But we shall bring her round in time." Under thedripping dome she raised her face to his. "Don't youremember what you said the day before yesterday? 'Togetherwe can't fail to pull it off for him!' I've told Owen that,so you're pledged and there's no going back."The day before yesterday! Was it possible that, no longerago, life had seemed a sufficiently simple business for asane man to hazard such assurances?</p> 
<p>　　"Anna," he questioned her abruptly, "why are you so anxiousfor this marriage?"She stopped short to face him. "Why? But surely I'veexplained to you--or rather I've hardly had to, you seemedso in sympathy with my reasons!""I didn't know, then, who it was that Owen wanted to marry."The words were out with a spring and he felt a clearer airin his brain. But her logic hemmed him in.</p> 
<p>　　"You knew yesterday; and you assured me then that you hadn'ta word to say----""Against Miss Viner?" The name, once uttered, sounded on andon in his ears. "Of course not. But that doesn'tnecessarily imply that I think her a good match for Owen."Anna made no immediate answer. When she spoke it was toquestion: "Why don't you think her a good match for Owen?""Well--Madame de Chantelle's reasons seem to me not quite asnegligible as you think.""You mean the fact that she's been Mrs. Murrett's secretary,and that the people who employed her before were calledHoke? For, as far as Owen and I can make out, these are thegravest charges against her.""Still, one can understand that the match is not what Madamede Chantelle had dreamed of.""Oh, perfectly--if that's all you mean."The lodge was in sight, and she hastened her step. Hestrode on beside her in silence, but at the gate she checkedhim with the question: "Is it really all you mean?""Of course," he heard himself declare.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, then I think I shall convince you--even if I can't,like Madame de Chantelle, summon all the Everards to myaid!" She lifted to him the look of happy laughter thatsometimes brushed her with a gleam of spring.</p> 
<p>　　Darrow watched her hasten along the path between thedripping chrysanthemums and enter the lodge. After she hadgone in he paced up and down outside in the drizzle, waitingto learn if she had any message to send back to the house;and after the lapse of a few minutes she came out again.</p> 
<p>　　The child, she said, was badly, though not dangerously,hurt, and the village doctor, who was already on hand, hadasked that the surgeon, already summoned from Francheuil,should be told to bring with him certain needful appliances.</p> 
<p>　　Owen had started by motor to fetch the surgeon, but therewas still time to communicate with the latter by telephone.</p> 
<p>　　The doctor furthermore begged for an immediate provision ofsuch bandages and disinfectants as Givre itself couldfurnish, and Anna bade Darrow address himself to Miss Viner,who would know where to find the necessary things, and woulddirect one of the servants to bicycle with them to thelodge.</p> 
<p>　　Darrow, as he hurried off on this errand, had at onceperceived the opportunity it offered of a word with SophyViner. What that word was to be he did not know; but now,if ever, was the moment to make it urgent and conclusive.</p> 
<p>　　It was unlikely that he would again have such a chance ofunobserved talk with her.</p> 
<p>　　He had supposed he should find her with her pupil in theschool-room; but he learned from a servant that Effie hadgone to Francheuil with her step-brother, and that MissViner was still in her room. Darrow sent her word that hewas the bearer of a message from the lodge, and a momentlater he heard her coming down the stairs.</p>
