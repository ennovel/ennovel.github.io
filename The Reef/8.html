It streamed against Darrow's high-perchedwindows, reduced their vast prospect of roofs and chimneysto a black oily huddle, and filled the room with the drabtwilight of an underground aquarium.</p> 
<p>　　The streams descended with the regularity of a third day'srain, when trimming and shuffling are over, and the weatherhas settled down to do its worst. There were no variationsof rhythm, no lyrical ups and downs: the grey linesstreaking the panes were as dense and uniform as a page ofunparagraphed narrative.</p> 
<p>　　George Darrow had drawn his armchair to the fire. The time-table he had been studying lay on the floor, and he satstaring with dull acquiescence into the boundless blur ofrain, which affected him like a vast projection of his ownstate of mind. Then his eyes travelled slowly about theroom.</p> 
<p>　　It was exactly ten days since his hurried unpacking hadstrewn it with the contents of his portmanteaux. Hisbrushes and razors were spread out on the blotched marble ofthe chest of drawers. A stack of newspapers had accumulatedon the centre table under the "electrolier", and half adozen paper novels lay on the mantelpiece among cigar-casesand toilet bottles; but these traces of his passage had madeno mark on the featureless dulness of the room, its look ofbeing the makeshift setting of innumerable transientcollocations. There was something sardonic, almostsinister, in its appearance of having deliberately "made up"for its anonymous part, all in noncommittal drabs andbrowns, with a carpet and paper that nobody would remember,and chairs and tables as impersonal as railway porters.</p> 
<p>　　Darrow picked up the time-table and tossed it on to thetable. Then he rose to his feet, lit a cigar and went tothe window. Through the rain he could just discover theface of a clock in a tall building beyond the railway roofs.</p> 
<p>　　He pulled out his watch, compared the two time-pieces, andstarted the hands of his with such a rush that they flewpast the hour and he had to make them repeat the circuitmore deliberately. He felt a quite disproportionateirritation at the trifling blunder. When he had correctedit he went back to his chair and threw himself down, leaningback his head against his hands. Presently his cigar wentout, and he got up, hunted for the matches, lit it again andreturned to his seat.</p> 
<p>　　The room was getting on his nerves. During the first fewdays, while the skies were clear, he had not noticed it, orhad felt for it only the contemptuous indifference of thetraveller toward a provisional shelter. But now that he wasleaving it, was looking at it for the last time, it seemedto have taken complete possession of his mind, to be soakingitself into him like an ugly indelible blot. Every detailpressed itself on his notice with the familiarity of anaccidental confidant: whichever way he turned, he felt thenudge of a transient intimacy...</p> 
<p>　　The one fixed point in his immediate future was that hisleave was over and that he must be back at his post inLondon the next morning. Within twenty-four hours he wouldagain be in a daylight world of recognized activities,himself a busy, responsible, relatively necessary factor inthe big whirring social and official machine. That fixedobligation was the fact he could think of with the leastdiscomfort, yet for some unaccountable reason it was the oneon which he found it most difficult to fix his thoughts.</p> 
<p>　　Whenever he did so, the room jerked him back into the circleof its insistent associations. It was extraordinary withwhat a microscopic minuteness of loathing he hated it all:</p> 
<p>　　the grimy carpet and wallpaper, the black marble mantel-piece, the clock with a gilt allegory under a dusty bell,the high-bolstered brown-counterpaned bed, the framed cardof printed rules under the electric light switch, and thedoor of communication with the next room. He hated the doormost of all...</p> 
<p>　　At the outset, he had felt no special sense ofresponsibility. He was satisfied that he had struck theright note, and convinced of his power of sustaining it.</p> 
<p>　　The whole incident had somehow seemed, in spite of itsvulgar setting and its inevitable prosaic propinquities, tobe enacting itself in some unmapped region outside the paleof the usual. It was not like anything that had everhappened to him before, or in which he had ever picturedhimself as likely to be involved; but that, at first, hadseemed no argument against his fitness to deal with it.</p> 
<p>　　Perhaps but for the three days' rain he might have got awaywithout a doubt as to his adequacy. The rain had made allthe difference. It had thrown the whole picture out ofperspective, blotted out the mystery of the remoter planesand the enchantment of the middle distance, and thrust intoprominence every commonplace fact of the foreground. It wasthe kind of situation that was not helped by being thoughtover; and by the perversity of circumstance he had beenforced into the unwilling contemplation of its everyaspect...</p> 
<p>　　His cigar had gone out again, and he threw it into the fireand vaguely meditated getting up to find another. But themere act of leaving his chair seemed to call for a greaterexertion of the will than he was capable of, and he leanedhis head back with closed eyes and listened to the drummingof the rain.</p> 
<p>　　A different noise aroused him. It was the opening andclosing of the door leading from the corridor into theadjoining room. He sat motionless, without opening hiseyes; but now another sight forced itself under his loweredlids. It was the precise photographic picture of that otherroom. Everything in it rose before him and pressed itselfupon his vision with the same acuity of distinctness as theobjects surrounding him. A step sounded on the floor, andhe knew which way the step was directed, what pieces offurniture it had to skirt, where it would probably pause,and what was likely to arrest it. He heard another sound,and recognized it as that of a wet umbrella placed in theblack marble jamb of the chimney-piece, against the hearth.</p> 
<p>　　He caught the creak of a hinge, and instantly differentiatedit as that of the wardrobe against the opposite wall. Thenhe heard the mouse-like squeal of a reluctant drawer, andknew it was the upper one in the chest of drawers beside thebed: the clatter which followed was caused by the mahoganytoilet-glass jumping on its loosened pivots...</p> 
<p>　　The step crossed the floor again. It was strange how muchbetter he knew it than the person to whom it belonged! Nowit was drawing near the door of communication between thetwo rooms. He opened his eyes and looked. The step hadceased and for a moment there was silence. Then he heard alow knock. He made no response, and after an interval hesaw that the door handle was being tentatively turned. Heclosed his eyes once more...</p> 
<p>　　The door opened, and the step was in the room, comingcautiously toward him. He kept his eyes shut, relaxing hisbody to feign sleep. There was another pause, then awavering soft advance, the rustle of a dress behind hischair, the warmth of two hands pressed for a moment on hislids. The palms of the hands had the lingering scent of somestuff that he had bought on the Boulevard...He looked up andsaw a letter falling over his shoulder to his knee...</p> 
<p>　　"Did I disturb you? I'm so sorry! They gave me this just nowwhen I came in."The letter, before he could catch it, had slipped betweenhis knees to the floor. It lay there, address upward, athis feet, and while he sat staring down at the strongslender characters on the blue-gray envelope an arm reachedout from behind to pick it up.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, don't--DON'T" broke from him, and he bent over andcaught the arm. The face above it was close to his.</p> 
<p>　　"Don't what?"----"take the trouble," he stammered.</p> 
<p>　　He dropped the arm and stooped down. His grasp closed overthe letter, he fingered its thickness and weight andcalculated the number of sheets it must contain.</p> 
<p>　　Suddenly he felt the pressure of the hand on his shoulder,and became aware that the face was still leaning over him,and that in a moment he would have to look up and kiss it...</p> 
<p>　　He bent forward first and threw the unopened letter into themiddle of the fire.</p>
