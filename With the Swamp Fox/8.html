BLACK MINGO SWAMP.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      A protracted halt to men whose hearts are heavy is not a desirable boon, and so we from Williamsburg soon discovered.
<br> 
<br> The first idea in our minds, when we were come into camp and began to build shelters for ourselves, each after his own liking, was that we could enjoy this respite from a roving life, where it was necessary to be constantly on the alert against danger.
<br> 
<br> Once we had really settled down, however, and there was nothing of especial moment with which to occupy our attention, the hours moved so slowly as to seem like unto days.
<br> 
<br> At first we three comrades spent a goodly portion of the time speculating among ourselves [168] as to how long we might be able to hold the field against the numberless men which the king was sending in pursuit; but after a time we were wearied with such occupation, and began to long for active duty.
<br> 
<br> This isolation and sense of perfect security grew irksome, and there was not a man among the small detachment who would not gladly have faced a foe of five times our number, in order to shake off the lethargy which began to creep over him after eight and forty hours had passed.
<br> 
<br> On the fourth day after our having settled down in this encampment, Major James and Captain Mouzon were sent back into the lower Carolinas to make certain those who were enlisted in the Williamsburg brigade held steadfast to their pledges, and the absence of our uncle was to Percy and I like a great calamity. We looked upon him not only as the head of the family; but as a true friend and companion-in-arms upon whom we could rely under every circumstance, [169] and although not thrown much in his company because of the position we occupied in the force, the knowledge of his being near at hand, did we need his advice, was in itself a pleasurable satisfaction which we failed fully to realize until he was absent.
<br> 
<br> When a week passed and we were "rusting out," as Gavin Witherspoon said, it seemed absolutely necessary we have some employment, and the old man said to me one morning while Percy was making ready the breakfast:
<br> 
<br> "Three men have already been sent out as scouts since we came into this camp, and such duty is necessary because it stands to reason that the Tories will make every effort to discover the general's hiding-place."
<br> 
<br> "Ay, all you have said is true, Gavin Witherspoon," I replied; "but of what avail is it to us since the general calls upon others to act as scouts, forgetting that we readily performed such duty when it was [170] an hundred times more dangerous than at present?"
<br> 
<br> "This is how it may avail," the old man said in the tone of one who defies contradiction. "You shall go this morning to General Marion and offer the services of us three, promising that we will act as scouts so long as the detachment remains here."
<br> 
<br> "But if he refuses to detail us for such work?"
<br> 
<br> "Then pluck up sufficient courage to remind him that we went gladly, when, perchance, every man in the command would have hesitated. By so doing you may make him understand he owes something to us three."
<br> 
<br> At first thought I was not willing to browbeat our commander, for it appeared to me that what Gavin Witherspoon had proposed was little less than an attempt to bully the general into acceding to our desires; but the longer I considered the matter the more reasonable did it seem [171] that we should be sent out, rather than forced to remain in camp where our presence was of no possible benefit.
<br> 
<br> By going we should take away nothing of value from the encampment, and it might be possible fortune would so favor us that we could render some signal assistance, even though it did not seem probable there was any force of the enemy in that vicinity.
<br> 
<br> Therefore it was that I did as Gavin Witherspoon requested, and to our great surprise the general not only willingly gave his consent, but said it pleasured him much that we should so desire to serve the Cause.
<br> 
<br> "While we remain here waiting such turn in the tide of affairs as will give us an opportunity to serve the colonists, it is well to know thoroughly all the country and its inhabitants," he said in conclusion. "Therefore, so that you return to camp and report once in every four and twenty hours, you not only have my permission; [172] but will lay me under obligation by acting the part of scouts, spies or whatsoever you choose to call the officer."
<br> 
<br> It can well be understood that we did not linger long after this interview.
<br> 
<br> In less than an hour we three, provided with such store of provisions as would be our portion until the following day, and carrying an ample amount of ammunition, set out with no idea whatsoever as to where chance might lead us, save that it seemed wisest to travel toward the south, for in that direction lay home and friends.
<br> 
<br> Gavin Witherspoon at once took command of the party by proceeding in advance, and we, having good cause to trust him implicitly, were more than willing to follow as he should propose.
<br> 
<br> There was no thought in our minds that a single enemy might be near at hand.
<br> 
<br> The only possibility counted upon was that we should run across one or more Tories seeking to find the encampment, and thus, perchance, prevent discovery. [173]
<br> 
<br> Thus it was we proceeded with a certain amount of caution, although not deeming it necessary.
<br> 
<br> Until late in the afternoon we traveled along the banks of the Waccamaw River, our faces turned toward Williamsburg, and then Percy said, as he threw himself at full length by the side of the stream:
<br> 
<br> "We are come on a mission which cannot bear fruit, and it makes little difference whether we halt here, or five miles further on. Having remained so long in camp without exercise, my legs tire quickly, and I propose to rest for the night."
<br> 
<br> We were ready to gratify him in this respect, the more so because all of us were in much the same condition, and therefore it was that our scout came to an end, for the time being, hardly more than fifteen miles from the starting-point.
<br> 
<br> Surely we had no reason to grumble against fortune on this our first visit in the Upper Carolinas.
<br> 
<br> Such food as we had was ready cooked, [174] and in order to make camp it was only necessary to lie down among the bushes, where for a time all slept as we had not done during the time of idleness.
<br> 
<br> The sun was within an hour of setting when I awakened and found my companions lying in restful attitudes, but with open eyes.
<br> 
<br> They also had satisfied the desire for slumber.
<br> 
<br> How it chanced that we three remained there without speaking one to another, I know not; but so we did, strangely enough, and because of our unwitting silence were we enabled to accomplish that which had seemed improbable.
<br> 
<br> Human voices in the distance, but sounding nearer and nearer, attracted our attention, causing all three to rise and seek better concealment, when we saw through the foliage a party of seven armed men coming up the bank of the stream from the south, and proceeding with a certain degree of caution which told that [175] they were in search of something or some one.
<br> 
<br> Although not absolutely certain, we felt reasonably sure these travelers were enemies, and well we might, considering the fact that nowhere between here and the Carolinas was it known that any friends of the Cause had habitation.
<br> 
<br> When the party passed where we were in hiding, they had ceased conversation; therefore we had no means of determining who they were, save that all wore portions of a Britisher's accouterments, while our friends still held to the powder-horn and shot-pouch.
<br> 
<br> Not until they were lost to view in the distance did either of us speak, and then it was Percy who said, much as if he had made an important discovery:
<br> 
<br> "They are Tories, and searching for General Marion's encampment."
<br> 
<br> "I allow all that to be true, lad, and now what may be our duty?" Gavin Witherspoon asked. [176]
<br> 
<br> "To learn where they halt for the night, and then carry the information back to camp," my brother said heedlessly, for indeed that seemed to be the only course left for us.
<br> 
<br> "There is in my mind a better plan, lad, and, if it so be you two are willing to take the chances, I venture to predict we will carry yonder gentlemen before General Marion, instead of hastening ahead to tell him they are coming."
<br> 
<br> "Do you mean that we three are to attack seven?" Percy asked, and the old man said with a smile:
<br> 
<br> "I have seen both you lads ride gallantly forward when it was a case of twenty against one, and yet you hesitate with the odds not much more than double against us?"
<br> 
<br> "Percy does not hesitate," I replied, jealous lest there should be a question as to the courage of one of our family. "So that it is in your mind, Gavin Witherspoon, [177] we will agree to anything that has the faintest hope of success."
<br> 
<br> "This is my plan: Yonder strangers are doubtless enemies; but if they prove to be friends, then have we done them no harm by carrying out that which is in my mind. We will follow so far in the rear that there is no danger of being discovered until they camp for the night, and then it will go hard indeed if we fail to find an opportunity for making them prisoners."
<br> 
<br> I did not agree with Gavin Witherspoon in his belief that we might readily make prisoners of seven men; yet was I well pleased to venture the attempt, believing something of good might come, even though we failed in the purpose. It was seldom we who held true to the colonies had an opportunity of striking even so slight a blow as this when the odds were no more than two against one, and it would have been folly for us to have refused such a chance.
<br> 
<br> Percy, once the plan was made plain, did [178] not consider it necessary to say whether he agreed to it or not.
<br> 
<br> To his mind, all who were acquainted with him should know he would favor any plan, and there was little need for Gavin Witherspoon to go further into details than he had already done.
<br> 
<br> "It is such work as this for which we left the camp," Percy said quietly, "and if the strangers are friends, we can atone for any rough handling by showing them the way to General Marion's camp."
<br> 
<br> This, so nearly as I can repeat it after these many years, was all that passed between us regarding the venture, and we set off on the trail without further delay.
<br> 
<br> There is less difficulty in successfully stalking a man than a deer, and this last had both Percy and I performed time and time again until it seemed to us like a simple task. Therefore it was that Gavin Witherspoon had no green hands to aid him in the work he had cut out.
<br> 
<br> Keeping so far in the rear as to hear the [179] noise as they forced their way through the underbrush, and yet not so near that we might by any possibility be seen, the three of us followed this little company who might be friends, but were probably enemies, until the going down of the sun, when we knew from such sounds as came to us that they had halted.
<br> 
<br> Now it was only a matter of waiting, which, under almost any circumstances, is the most difficult task to perform patiently; yet every lad who has hunted wild turkeys is well schooled in such work, and it can safely be said that we did not risk a failure by being over-eager.
<br> 
<br> The men, although having advanced with but little caution, realized the fact that there might be enemies in the vicinity, for they forbore building a camp-fire, and this fact rendered our work rather more difficult than it otherwise would have been.
<br> 
<br> After it was certain they had settled down for the night we stole nearer and nearer, until it was possible to hear the [180] conversation carried on in an ordinary tone, and then we remained motionless until the time for action should arrive.
<br> 
<br> When we were come thus far I believed we should hear such words as would declare whether these seven men were friends or enemies, and in this I was not disappointed, although we failed to learn anything of importance.
<br> 
<br> While eating supper one of them, in the course of the ordinary conversation concerning the tramp of the day, remarked:
<br> 
<br> "There is no probability we shall find any of the rebels during the next two or three days' march, for as yet we are among those who remain loyal to the king."
<br> 
<br> The words as written above were all we had to give us a clue to the character of these strangers; but they were sufficient.
<br> 
<br> We knew now, as well as if these men had explained at length, that they were in search of General Marion's encampment, and from that instant, answering for Percy as well as Gavin Witherspoon, I know that [181] the three of us counted on making a capture at whatsoever hazard.
<br> 
<br> Not until fully an hour after the men had stretched themselves upon the ground and the last word was spoken between them, did we make a move toward nearing the encampment.
<br> 
<br> Then it was that I would have gone forward, risking the danger with the belief that my life had better be made the price, rather than either of the others, when the old man laid his hand on mine as he whispered softly in my ear:
<br> 
<br> "It is for me to go, first, because I have had more experience in such work, and again, on the plea that I can best be spared to the Cause if either of us must pay a penalty for leading in the attack."
<br> 
<br> Although there may be the twang of a braggart in the words, still must it be set down that I tried to restrain Gavin Witherspoon, but without success.
<br> 
<br> When I would have pushed him away he held me back, and it seemed impossible [182] to advance without such a squabble as would have given the alarm.
<br> 
<br> I was absolutely forced to let him take the lead; but Percy and I kept close upon his heels.
<br> 
<br> When, after creeping so cautiously that not a twig snapped beneath our weight, we had come to the small cleared place on the bank of the stream which the men had selected as an encampment, we saw that they were sleeping near the foot of a pine tree that had been overturned by the wind.
<br> 
<br> The overhanging mass of roots formed a certain sort of shelter which served to protect them from the dew.
<br> 
<br> Their rifles were stacked against one of the branches at a distance of fully three yards from where they lay, and, as a matter of course, it was necessary to first secure possession of these. 
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;Gavin did his work, as we knew beyond a question he could do, and when he raised himself beside the weapons, we two, Percy [183] and I, sprang to our feet, calling upon the sleepers to surrender.
<br> 
<br> They had no other choice than to obey, and sheepish indeed were these seven after we had drawn them up in line, when they understood how small was the force which had taken them prisoners.
<br> 
<br> Yet were they reasonably good men, so far as Tories go, inasmuch as no one spoke a word, all refusing to answer the questions which we asked.
<br> 
<br> So far as we ourselves were concerned this made little difference, and without delay, although they as well as ourselves were fatigued, most likely, by the long tramp, we began the return to General Marion's camp.
<br> 
<br> As it proved later, our capture was of great importance, even though the prisoners stoutly refused to give information when the general questioned them, for their presence showed that Tarleton was hot after us, knowing somewhat of our whereabouts, and the time was come when we [184] must retreat yet further, or return to the task of showing the invaders that the spirit of liberty in these southern colonies was not yet crushed out.
<br> 
<br> Now let me set down here what we had learned since the day when we set free the one hundred and fifty Continentals who refused, save in the case of the three true men, to join our force.
<br> 
<br> Major Wemyss had marched for seventy miles from Nelson's Ferry, straight across the district of Williamsburg, desolating a path fifteen miles in breadth after such merciless fashion that one would have said he had been taught in the schools of the savage.
<br> 
<br> All the dwellings on his way, save those habited by well-known Tories, were given to the flames; the people were plundered of their possessions; such property as the troops could not use was destroyed, while the animals were wantonly shot and allowed to rot where they fell.
<br> 
<br> Those who were thus plundered saw all [185] their belongings swept away by fire, and they, even to the women and children, were held forcibly back to prevent them from saving the smallest article of value.
<br> 
<br> Men were hanged without semblance of trial, and when their loved ones pleaded for mercy, the British soldiery rode them down.
<br> 
<br> All the time it seemed almost as if the good God had forsaken the colonies, and yet we came to know that all these acts of barbarous cruelty were necessary to arouse our people from the fear and the despondency into which they had fallen.
<br> 
<br> It did arouse them.
<br> 
<br> It forced men into the ranks of the patriots who otherwise would have waited quietly by until the colonies or the king should have proven a right to the country.
<br> 
<br> Within two days from the time the seven scouts were taken prisoners and we had arrived at our encampment, the hour was come when we should return, and among [186] those on the banks of the Waccamaw who held steadfast to General Marion, there was no one who did not rejoice because the moment for action was at hand.
<br> 
<br> Taking the prisoners with us, we set out on a forced march, which was continued night and day until we had seen the sun rise and set three times while we yet remained in the saddle, save when it was absolutely necessary to give rest to our steeds.
<br> 
<br> Then we were come to Lynch's Creek once more—to the old camp—where we found all those who had waited behind until the signal should be given, with the addition of more than two hundred new recruits—men who had been driven by the cruelty of the king's hirelings into the ranks of those who would save their country.
<br> 
<br> More than this, those whom we met gave information that Major Wemyss had retired to Georgetown, wearied with chasing the Swamp Fox, and a body of six [187] hundred well-armed Tories were encamped near Black Mingo Swamp, fifteen miles below where we were halted, under command of Captain John Ball.
<br> 
<br> Here was our work cut out for us, and like the true patriot and ardent soldier that he was, General Marion gave us no cause to complain of hesitation on his part.
<br> 
<br> It was less than four hours from the time our command was halted, and while yet we were exchanging greetings with those who had parted from us so many days before, that our commander, calling the men in a body around him, thus spoke:
<br> 
<br> "Hardly more than two hours' ride from here are encamped a force of these renegades whom we call Tories. They outnumber us slightly; but even though there were twice as many, yet I believe you who have served so gallantly under me since I came into the Williamsburg district, could whip them in the open field. We are told that recruits are flocking from [188] every quarter of this portion of the colony to join us, and by waiting we may double our strength; yet at the same time it is possible that the enemy will take the alarm and flee. I propose that we march at once, and within twenty-four hours from the time of returning to the scene of our labors strike such a blow as shall give Tarleton and Wemyss to understand that the spirit of liberty has been revived, rather than broken, by their butcheries and their barbarities."
<br> 
<br> A ringing cheer, in which every man participated, was the answer to this speech, and more than that no commander could need.
<br> 
<br> Five minutes later, it could not have been more, we were in the saddle, led by two sons of Captain Waties, who had already made themselves familiar with the approaches to the enemy's camp, and Major James, my uncle, said as he reined his horse in that he might fall back between Percy and I for a moment: [189]
<br> 
<br> "Lads, we have once more taken up the work, and with such a commander I venture to predict that it will not cease, until the last adherent to the Cause has yielded up his life, or we have brought the Carolinas out from under the sway of the butchers."
<br> 
<br> Gavin Witherspoon, who had been riding slightly in the rear, spurred his horse forward until he could speak with my uncle:
<br> 
<br> "Whereabout in the Black Mingo are these scurvy scoundrels encamped?"
<br> 
<br> "At Shepherd's Ferry on the south side of the stream."
<br> 
<br> "Then we must cross that bridge on planks, if I mistake not, in order to come at them?"
<br> 
<br> "You are right, Gavin."
<br> 
<br> "And so many horsemen as we number may not be able to do that without giving an alarm."
<br> 
<br> "It is a chance which we must take. Whether they have warning of our approach, or not, from the moment we reach the causeway our advance must be rapid." [190]
<br> 
<br> Then my uncle rode ahead to join General Marion, and we, tired and sleepy from being long in the saddle without proper hours of rest, relapsed into silence until we were arrived at this same bridge of which Gavin had spoken.
<br> 
<br> It was midnight, and I had said to Percy that all the odds were in our favor, so far as taking the enemy by surprise was concerned, when the foremost of the troops clattered across the planks.
<br> 
<br> Within sixty seconds an alarm gun was heard from the Tory encampment.
<br> 
<br> Now was come the time, and the first, when we two lads were to take part in a conflict where the enemy was expecting us.
<br> 
<br> It would be a real battle, and Percy cried, clasping my hand as we spurred our horses on at a gallop lest we be left in the rear:
<br> 
<br> "We may perchance come to our death, Bob, before the sun shall rise again; but it shall never be said that we failed to follow the head of the family wherever he might lead!"
