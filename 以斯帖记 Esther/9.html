<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;) 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, when the time came for the king's order to be put into effect, on the very day when the haters of the Jews had been hoping to have rule over them; though the opposite had come about, and the Jews had rule over their haters; 
<br>9:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 犹 大 人 在 亚 哈 随 鲁 王 各 省 的 城 里 聚 集 ， 下 手 击 杀 那 要 害 他 们 的 人 。 无 人 能 敌 挡 他 们 ， 因 为 各 族 都 惧 怕 他 们 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; On that day, the Jews came together in their towns through all the divisions of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, for the purpose of attacking all those who were attempting evil against them: and everyone had to give way before them, for the fear of them had come on all the peoples. 
<br>9:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 各 省 的 首 领 ， 总 督 ， 省 长 ， 和 办 理 王 事 的 人 ， 因 惧 怕 末 底 改 ， 就 都 帮 助 犹 大 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And all the chiefs and the captains and the rulers and those who did the king's business gave support to the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai had come on them. 
<br>9:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 末 底 改 在 朝 中 为 大 ， 名 声 传 遍 各 省 ， 日 渐 昌 盛 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and word of him went out through every part of the kingdom: for the man Mordecai became greater and greater. 
<br>9:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 犹 大 人 用 刀 击 杀 一 切 仇 敌 ， 任 意 杀 灭 恨 他 们 的 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So the Jews overcame all their attackers with the sword and with death and destruction, and did to their haters whatever they had a desire to do. 
<br>9:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 在 书 珊 城 ， 犹 大 人 杀 灭 了 五 百 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And in Shushan the Jews put to death five hundred men. 
<br>9:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 又 杀 巴 珊 大 他 ， 达 分 ， 亚 斯 帕 他 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; They put to death Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 
<br>9:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 破 拉 他 ， 亚 大 利 雅 ， 亚 利 大 他 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, 
<br>9:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 帕 玛 斯 他 ， 亚 利 赛 ， 亚 利 代 ， 瓦 耶 撒 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha, 
<br>9:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 这 十 人 都 是 哈 米 大 他 的 孙 子 ， 犹 大 人 仇 敌 哈 曼 的 儿 子 。 犹 大 人 却 没 有 下 手 夺 取 财 物 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the hater of the Jews; but they put not a hand on any of their goods. 
<br>9:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 当 日 ， 将 书 珊 城 被 杀 的 人 数 呈 在 王 前 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; On that day the number of those who had been put to death in the town of Shushan was given to the king. 
<br>9:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 王 对 王 后 以 斯 帖 说 ， 犹 大 人 在 书 珊 城 杀 灭 了 五 百 人 ， 又 杀 了 哈 曼 的 十 个 儿 子 ， 在 王 的 各 省 不 知 如 何 呢 ？ 现 在 你 要 什 么 ， 我 必 赐 给 你 。 你 还 求 什 么 ， 也 必 为 你 成 就 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the king said to Esther the queen, The Jews have put five hundred men to death in Shushan, as well as the ten sons of Haman: what then have they done in the rest of the kingdom! Now what is your prayer? for it will be given to you; what other request have you? and it will be done. 
<br>9:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 斯 帖 说 ， 王 若 以 为 美 ， 求 你 准 书 珊 的 犹 大 人 ， 明 日 也 照 今 日 的 旨 意 行 ， 并 将 哈 曼 十 个 儿 子 的 尸 首 挂 在 木 架 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Esther said, If it is the king's pleasure, let authority be given to the Jews in Shushan to do tomorrow as has been done today, and let orders be given for the hanging of Haman's ten sons. 
<br>9:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 王 便 允 准 如 此 行 。 旨 意 传 在 书 珊 ， 人 就 把 哈 曼 十 个 儿 子 的 尸 首 挂 起 来 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the king said that this was to be done, and the order was given out in Shushan, and the hanging of Haman's ten sons was effected. 
<br>9:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 亚 达 月 十 四 日 书 珊 的 犹 大 人 又 聚 集 在 书 珊 ， 杀 了 三 百 人 ， 却 没 有 下 手 夺 取 财 物 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For the Jews who were in Shushan came together again on the fourteenth day of the month Adar and put to death three hundred men in Shushan; but they put not a hand on their goods. 
<br>9:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 在 王 各 省 其 余 的 犹 大 人 ， 也 都 聚 集 保 护 性 命 ， 杀 了 恨 他 们 的 人 七 万 五 千 ， 却 没 有 下 手 夺 取 财 物 。 这 样 ， 就 脱 离 仇 敌 ， 得 享 平 安 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the other Jews in every division of the kingdom came together, fighting for their lives, and got salvation from their haters and put seventy-five thousand of them to death; but they did not put a hand on their goods. 
<br>9:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 亚 达 月 十 三 日 ， 行 了 这 事 。 十 四 日 安 息 ， 以 这 日 为 设 筵 欢 乐 的 日 子 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; This they did on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same month they took their rest, and made it a day of feasting and joy. 
<br>9:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 但 书 珊 的 犹 大 人 ， 这 十 三 日 ， 十 四 日 聚 集 杀 戮 仇 敌 。 十 五 日 安 息 ， 以 这 日 为 设 筵 欢 乐 的 日 子 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But the Jews in Shushan came together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth day of the month; and on the fifteenth day they took their rest, and made it a day of feasting and joy. 
<br>9:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 所 以 住 无 城 墙 乡 村 的 犹 大 人 ， 如 今 都 以 亚 达 月 十 四 日 为 设 筵 欢 乐 的 吉 日 ， 彼 此 馈 送 礼 物 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So the Jews of the country places living in unwalled towns make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of feasting and joy and a good day, a day for sending offerings one to another. 
<br>9:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 末 底 改 记 录 这 事 ， 写 信 与 亚 哈 随 鲁 王 各 省 远 近 所 有 的 犹 大 人 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews in every division of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, near and far, 
<br>9:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 嘱 咐 他 们 每 年 守 亚 达 月 十 四 ， 十 五 两 日 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; To stablish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Ordering them to keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar and the fifteenth day of the same month, every year, 
<br>9:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 这 月 的 两 日 为 犹 大 人 脱 离 仇 敌 得 平 安 ， 转 忧 为 喜 ， 转 悲 为 乐 的 吉 日 。 在 这 两 日 设 筵 欢 乐 ， 彼 此 馈 送 礼 物 ， 周 济 穷 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; As days on which the Jews had rest from their haters, and the month which for them was turned from sorrow to joy, and from weeping to a good day: and that they were to keep them as days of feasting and joy, of sending offerings to one another and good things to the poor. 
<br>9:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 ， 犹 大 人 按 着 末 底 改 所 写 与 他 们 的 信 ， 应 承 照 初 次 所 守 的 守 为 永 例 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the Jews gave their word to go on as they had been doing and as Mordecai had given them orders in writing; 
<br>9:24 [hgb]&nbsp; 是 因 犹 大 人 的 仇 敌 ， 亚 甲 族 哈 米 大 他 的 儿 子 哈 曼 ， 设 谋 杀 害 犹 大 人 ， 掣 普 珥 ， 就 是 掣 签 ， 为 要 杀 尽 灭 绝 他 们 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Because Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the hater of all the Jews, had made designs for their destruction, attempting to get a decision by Pur (that is, chance) with a view to putting an end to them and cutting them off; 
<br>9:25 [hgb]&nbsp; 这 事 报 告 于 王 ， 王 便 降 旨 使 哈 曼 谋 害 犹 大 人 的 恶 事 ， 归 到 他 自 己 的 头 上 ， 并 吩 咐 把 他 和 他 的 众 子 都 挂 在 木 架 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But when the business was put before the king, he gave orders by letters that the evil design which he had made against the Jews was to be turned against himself; and that he and his sons were to be put to death by hanging. 
<br>9:26 [hgb]&nbsp; 照 着 普 珥 的 名 字 ， 犹 大 人 就 称 这 两 日 为 普 珥 日 。 他 们 因 这 信 上 的 话 ， 又 因 所 看 见 所 遇 见 的 事 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So these days were named Purim, after the name of Pur. And so, because of the words of this letter, and of what they had seen in connection with this business, and what had come to them, 
<br>9:27 [hgb]&nbsp; 就 应 承 自 己 与 后 裔 ， 并 归 附 他 们 的 人 ， 每 年 按 时 必 守 这 两 日 ， 永 远 不 废 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their appointed time every year; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The Jews made a rule and gave an undertaking, causing their seed and all those who were joined to them to do the same, so that it might be in force for ever, that they would keep those two days, as ordered in the letter, at the fixed time every year; 
<br>9:28 [hgb]&nbsp; 各 省 各 城 ， 家 家 户 户 ， 世 世 代 代 纪 念 遵 守 这 两 日 ， 使 这 普 珥 日 在 犹 大 人 中 不 可 废 掉 ， 在 他 们 后 裔 中 也 不 可 忘 记 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And that those days were to be kept in memory through every generation and every family, in every division of the kingdom and every town, that there might never be a time when these days of Purim would not be kept among the Jews, or when the memory of them would go from the minds of their seed. 
<br>9:29 [hgb]&nbsp; 亚 比 孩 的 女 儿 王 后 以 斯 帖 ， 和 犹 大 人 末 底 改 以 全 权 写 第 二 封 信 ， 坚 嘱 犹 大 人 守 这 普 珥 日 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Esther the queen, daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, sent a second letter giving the force of their authority to the order about the Purim. 
<br>9:30 [hgb]&nbsp; 用 和 平 诚 实 话 ， 写 信 给 亚 哈 随 鲁 王 国 中 ， 一 百 二 十 七 省 所 有 的 犹 大 人 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he sent letters to all the Jews in the hundred and twenty-seven divisions of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with true words of peace, 
<br>9:31 [hgb]&nbsp; 劝 他 们 按 时 守 这 普 珥 日 ， 禁 食 呼 求 ， 是 照 犹 大 人 末 底 改 ， 和 王 后 以 斯 帖 ， 所 嘱 咐 的 。 也 照 犹 大 人 为 自 己 与 后 裔 所 应 承 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Giving the force of law to these days of Purim at their fixed times, as they had been ordered by Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen, and in keeping with the rules they had made for themselves and their seed, in connection with their time of going without food and their cry for help. 
<br>9:32 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 斯 帖 命 定 守 普 珥 日 ， 这 事 也 记 录 在 书 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The order given by Esther gave the force of law to the rules about the Purim; and it was recorded in the book.
