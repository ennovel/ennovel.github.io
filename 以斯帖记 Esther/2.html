<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; After these things, when the king's feelings were calmer, the thought of Vashti and what she had done and the order he had made against her, came back to his mind. 
<br>2:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 王 的 侍 臣 对 王 说 ， 不 如 为 王 寻 找 美 貌 的 处 女 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the servants who were waiting on the king said to him, Let search be made for some fair young virgins for the king: 
<br>2:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 王 可 以 派 官 在 国 中 的 各 省 ， 招 聚 美 貌 的 处 女 到 书 珊 城 （ 或 作 宫 ） 的 女 院 ， 交 给 掌 管 女 子 的 太 监 希 该 ， 给 她 们 当 用 的 香 品 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Let the king give authority to certain men in all the divisions of his kingdom, to get together all the fair young virgins and send them to Shushan, the king's town, to the women's house, under the care of Hegai, the king's servant, the keeper of the women: and let the things needed for making them clean be given to them; 
<br>2:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 王 所 喜 爱 的 女 子 可 以 立 为 王 后 ， 代 替 瓦 实 提 。 王 以 这 事 为 美 ， 就 如 此 行 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And let the girl who is pleasing to the king be queen in place of Vashti. And the king was pleased with this suggestion; and he did so. 
<br>2:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 书 珊 城 有 一 个 犹 大 人 ， 名 叫 末 底 改 ， 是 便 雅 悯 人 基 士 的 曾 孙 ， 示 每 的 孙 子 ， 睚 珥 的 儿 子 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now there was a certain Jew in Shushan named Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite; 
<br>2:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 从 前 巴 比 伦 王 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 ， 将 犹 大 王 耶 哥 尼 雅 （ 又 名 约 雅 斤 ） 和 百 姓 从 耶 路 撒 冷 掳 去 ， 末 底 改 也 在 其 内 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Who had been taken away from Jerusalem among those who had been made prisoner with Jeconiah, king of Judah, when Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had taken him away. 
<br>2:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 末 底 改 抚 养 他 叔 叔 的 女 儿 哈 大 沙 （ 后 名 以 斯 帖 ） ， 因 为 她 没 有 父 母 。 这 女 子 又 容 貌 俊 美 ， 她 父 母 死 了 ， 末 底 改 就 收 她 为 自 己 的 女 儿 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he had been a father to Hadassah, that is Esther, the daughter of his father's brother: for she had no father or mother, and she was very beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his daughter. 
<br>2:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 王 的 谕 旨 传 出 ， 就 招 聚 许 多 女 子 到 书 珊 城 ， 交 给 掌 管 女 子 的 希 该 。 以 斯 帖 也 送 入 王 宫 ， 交 付 希 该 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So when the order made by the king was publicly given out, and a number of girls had been placed in the care of Hegai in the king's house in Shushan, Esther was taken into the king's house and put in the care of Hegai, the keeper of the women. 
<br>2:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 希 该 喜 悦 以 斯 帖 ， 就 恩 待 她 。 急 忙 给 她 需 用 的 香 品 和 她 所 当 得 的 分 ， 又 派 所 当 得 的 七 个 宫 女 服 事 她 ， 使 她 和 她 的 宫 女 搬 入 女 院 上 好 的 房 屋 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he was pleased with the girl and was kind to her; and he quickly gave her what was needed for making her clean, and the things which were hers by right, and seven servant-girls who were to be hers from the king's house: and he had her and her servant-girls moved to the best place in the women's part of the house. 
<br>2:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 斯 帖 未 曾 将 籍 贯 宗 族 告 诉 人 ， 因 为 末 底 改 嘱 咐 她 不 可 叫 人 知 道 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Esther had not said what family or people she came from, for Mordecai had given her orders not to do so. 
<br>2:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 末 底 改 天 天 在 女 院 前 边 行 走 ， 要 知 道 以 斯 帖 平 安 不 平 安 ， 并 后 事 如 何 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And every day Mordecai took his walk before the square of the women's house, to see how Esther was and what would be done to her. 
<br>2:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 众 女 子 照 例 先 洁 净 身 体 十 二 个 月 。 六 个 月 用 没 药 油 ， 六 个 月 用 香 料 和 洁 身 之 物 。 满 了 日 期 ， 然 后 挨 次 进 去 见 亚 哈 随 鲁 王 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;) 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now every girl, when her turn came, had to go in to King Ahasuerus, after undergoing, for a space of twelve months, what was ordered by the law for the women (for this was the time necessary for making them clean, that is, six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet perfumes and such things as are needed for making women clean): 
<br>2:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 女 子 进 去 见 王 是 这 样 。 从 女 院 到 王 宫 的 时 候 ， 凡 她 所 要 的 都 必 给 她 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And in this way the girl went in to the king; whatever she had a desire for was given to her to take with her from the women's house into the house of the king. 
<br>2:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 晚 上 进 去 ， 次 日 回 到 女 子 第 二 院 ， 交 给 掌 管 妃 嫔 的 太 监 沙 甲 。 除 非 王 喜 爱 她 ， 再 提 名 召 她 ， 就 不 再 进 去 见 王 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; In the evening she went, and on the day after she came back to the second house of the women, into the keeping of Shaashgaz, one of the king's unsexed servants who had the care of the king's wives: only if the king had delight in her and sent for her by name did she go in to him again. 
<br>2:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 末 底 改 叔 叔 亚 比 孩 的 女 儿 ， 就 是 末 底 改 收 为 自 己 女 儿 的 以 斯 帖 ， 按 次 序 当 进 去 见 王 的 时 候 ， 除 了 掌 管 女 子 的 太 监 希 该 所 派 定 给 她 的 ， 她 别 无 所 求 。 凡 看 见 以 斯 帖 的 都 喜 悦 她 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now when the time came for Esther, the daughter of Abihail, his father's brother, whom Mordecai had taken as his daughter, to go in to the king, she made request for nothing but what Hegai, the king's servant and keeper of the women, had given her. And Esther was looked on kindly by all who saw her. 
<br>2:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 亚 哈 随 鲁 王 第 七 年 十 月 ， 就 是 提 别 月 ， 以 斯 帖 被 引 入 宫 见 王 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So Esther was taken in to King Ahasuerus in his house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his rule. 
<br>2:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 王 爱 以 斯 帖 过 于 爱 众 女 ， 她 在 王 眼 前 蒙 宠 爱 比 众 处 女 更 甚 。 王 就 把 王 后 的 冠 冕 戴 在 她 头 上 ， 立 她 为 王 后 ， 代 替 瓦 实 提 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Esther was more pleasing to the king than all the women, and to his eyes she was fairer and more full of grace than all the other virgins: so he put his crown on her head and made her queen in place of Vashti. 
<br>2:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 王 因 以 斯 帖 的 缘 故 给 众 首 领 和 臣 仆 设 摆 大 筵 席 ， 又 豁 免 各 省 的 租 税 ， 并 照 王 的 厚 意 大 颁 赏 赐 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the king gave a great feast for all his captains and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he gave orders through all the divisions of his kingdom for a day of rest from work, and gave wealth from his store. 
<br>2:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 第 二 次 招 聚 处 女 的 时 候 ， 末 底 改 坐 在 朝 门 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when the virgins came together in the second house of the women, Mordecai took his seat in the doorway of the king's house. 
<br>2:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 斯 帖 照 着 末 底 改 所 嘱 咐 的 ， 还 没 有 将 籍 贯 宗 族 告 诉 人 。 因 为 以 斯 帖 遵 末 底 改 的 命 ， 如 抚 养 她 的 时 候 一 样 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Esther had still said nothing of her family or her people, as Mordecai had given her orders; for Esther did what Mordecai said, as when she was living with him. 
<br>2:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 当 那 时 候 ， 末 底 改 坐 在 朝 门 ， 王 的 太 监 中 有 两 个 守 门 的 ， 辟 探 和 提 列 ， 恼 恨 亚 哈 随 鲁 王 ， 想 要 下 手 害 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; In those days, while Mordecai was seated at the king's doorway, two of the king's servants, Bigthan and Teresh, keepers of the door, being angry, were looking for a chance to make an attack on King Ahasuerus. 
<br>2:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 末 底 改 知 道 了 ， 就 告 诉 王 后 以 斯 帖 。 以 斯 帖 奉 末 底 改 的 名 ， 报 告 于 王 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Mordecai, having knowledge of their purpose, sent word of it to Esther the queen; and Esther gave the news to the king in Mordecai's name. 
<br>2:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 究 察 这 事 ， 果 然 是 实 ， 就 把 二 人 挂 在 木 头 上 ， 将 这 事 在 王 面 前 写 于 历 史 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when the thing had been looked into, it was seen to be true, and the two of them were put to death by hanging on a tree: and it was put down in the records before the king.
