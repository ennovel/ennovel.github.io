<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now after this, death came to the king of the children of Ammon, and Hanun, his son, became king in his place. 
<br>10:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 说 ， 我 要 照 哈 嫩 的 父 亲 拿 辖 厚 待 我 的 恩 典 厚 待 哈 嫩 。 于 是 大 卫 差 遣 臣 仆 ， 为 他 丧 父 安 慰 他 。 大 卫 的 臣 仆 到 了 亚 扪 人 的 境 内 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And David said, I will be a friend to Hanun, the son of Nahash, as his father was a friend to me. So David sent his servants, to give him words of comfort on account of his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon. 
<br>10:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 但 亚 扪 人 的 首 领 对 他 们 的 主 哈 嫩 说 ， 大 卫 差 人 来 安 慰 你 ， 你 想 他 是 尊 敬 你 父 亲 吗 ？ 他 差 臣 仆 来 不 是 详 察 窥 探 ， 要 倾 覆 这 城 吗 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But the chiefs of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, Does it seem to you that David is honouring your father by sending comforters to you? has he not sent his servants to go through the town and make secret observation of it, and overcome it? 
<br>10:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 哈 嫩 便 将 大 卫 臣 仆 的 胡 须 剃 去 一 半 ， 又 割 断 他 们 下 半 截 的 衣 服 ， 使 他 们 露 出 下 体 ， 打 发 他 们 回 去 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So Hanun took David's servants, and after cutting off half the hair on their chins, and cutting off the skirts of their robes up to the middle, he sent them away. 
<br>10:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 有 人 告 诉 大 卫 ， 他 就 差 人 去 迎 接 他 们 ， 因 为 他 们 甚 觉 羞 耻 ， 告 诉 他 们 说 ， 可 以 住 在 耶 利 哥 ， 等 到 胡 须 长 起 再 回 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; When David had news of it, he sent men out with the purpose of meeting them on their way, for the men were greatly shamed: and the king said, Go to Jericho till your hair is long again, and then come back. 
<br>10:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 亚 扪 人 知 道 大 卫 憎 恶 他 们 ， 就 打 发 人 去 ， 招 募 伯 利 合 的 亚 兰 人 和 琐 巴 的 亚 兰 人 ， 步 兵 二 万 ， 与 玛 迦 王 的 人 一 千 ， 陀 伯 人 一 万 二 千 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves hated by David, they sent to the Aramaeans of Beth-rehob and Zobah, and got for payment twenty thousand footmen, and they got from the king of Maacah a thousand men, and from Tob twelve thousand. 
<br>10:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 听 见 了 ， 就 差 派 约 押 统 带 勇 猛 的 全 军 出 去 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And hearing of this, David sent Joab and all the army and the best fighting-men. 
<br>10:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 亚 扪 人 出 来 ， 在 城 门 前 摆 阵 。 琐 巴 与 利 合 的 亚 兰 人 ， 陀 伯 人 ， 并 玛 迦 人 ， 另 在 郊 野 摆 阵 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the children of Ammon came out and put their forces in position at the way into the town: and the Aramaeans of Zobah and of Rehob, with the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field. 
<br>10:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 押 看 见 敌 人 在 他 前 后 摆 阵 ， 就 从 以 色 列 军 中 挑 选 精 兵 ， 使 他 们 对 着 亚 兰 人 摆 阵 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now when Joab saw that their forces were in position against him in front and at his back, he took the best of the men of Israel and put them in line against the Aramaeans; 
<br>10:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 其 余 的 兵 交 与 他 兄 弟 亚 比 筛 ， 对 着 亚 扪 人 摆 阵 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the rest of the people he put in position against the children of Ammon, with Abishai, his brother, at their head. 
<br>10:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 押 对 亚 比 筛 说 ， 亚 兰 人 若 强 过 我 ， 你 就 来 帮 助 我 。 亚 扪 人 若 强 过 你 ， 我 就 去 帮 助 你 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said, If the Aramaeans are stronger and get the better of me, then you are to come to my help; but if the children of Ammon get the better of you, I will come to your help. 
<br>10:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 们 都 当 刚 强 ， 为 本 国 的 民 和 神 的 城 邑 作 大 丈 夫 。 愿 耶 和 华 凭 他 的 意 旨 而 行 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Take heart, and let us be strong for our people and for the towns of our God, and may the Lord do what seems good to him. 
<br>10:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 ， 约 押 和 跟 随 他 的 人 前 进 攻 打 亚 兰 人 。 亚 兰 人 在 约 押 面 前 逃 跑 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Joab and the people with him went forward to the fight against the Aramaeans, and they went in flight before him. 
<br>10:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 亚 扪 人 见 亚 兰 人 逃 跑 ， 他 们 也 在 亚 比 筛 面 前 逃 跑 进 城 。 约 押 就 离 开 亚 扪 人 那 里 ， 回 耶 路 撒 冷 去 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when the children of Ammon saw the flight of the Aramaeans, they themselves went in flight from Abishai, and came into the town. So Joab went back from fighting the children of Ammon and came to Jerusalem. 
<br>10:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 亚 兰 人 见 自 己 被 以 色 列 人 打 败 ， 就 又 聚 集 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when the Aramaeans saw that Israel had overcome them, they got themselves together. 
<br>10:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 哈 大 底 谢 差 遣 人 ， 将 大 河 那 边 的 亚 兰 人 调 来 。 他 们 到 了 希 兰 ， 哈 大 底 谢 的 将 军 朔 法 率 领 他 们 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Hadadezer sent for the Aramaeans who were on the other side of the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach, the captain of Hadadezer's army, at their head. 
<br>10:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 有 人 告 诉 大 卫 ， 他 就 聚 集 以 色 列 众 人 ， 过 约 旦 河 ， 来 到 希 兰 。 亚 兰 人 迎 着 大 卫 摆 阵 ， 与 他 打 仗 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And word of this was given to David: and he got all Israel together and went over Jordan and came to Helam. And the Aramaeans put their forces in position against David, and made an attack on him. 
<br>10:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 亚 兰 人 在 以 色 列 人 面 前 逃 跑 。 大 卫 杀 了 亚 兰 七 百 辆 战 车 的 人 ， 四 万 马 兵 ， 又 杀 了 亚 兰 的 将 军 朔 法 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the Aramaeans went in flight before Israel; and David put to the sword the men of seven hundred Aramaean war-carriages and forty thousand footmen, and Shobach, the captain of the army, was wounded, and came to his death there. 
<br>10:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 属 哈 大 底 谢 的 诸 王 见 自 己 被 以 色 列 人 打 败 ， 就 与 以 色 列 人 和 好 ， 归 服 他 们 。 于 是 亚 兰 人 不 敢 再 帮 助 亚 扪 人 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when all the kings who were servants of Hadadezer saw that they were overcome by Israel, they made peace with Israel and became their servants. So the Aramaeans, in fear, gave no more help to the children of Ammon.
