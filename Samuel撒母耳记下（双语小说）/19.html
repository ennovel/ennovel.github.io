<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And word was given to Joab that the king was weeping and sorrowing for Absalom. 
<br>19:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 众 民 听 说 王 为 他 儿 子 忧 愁 ， 他 们 得 胜 的 欢 乐 却 变 成 悲 哀 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the salvation of that day was changed to sorrow for all the people: for it was said to the people, The king is in bitter grief for his son. 
<br>19:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 日 众 民 暗 暗 地 进 城 ， 就 如 败 阵 逃 跑 ， 惭 愧 的 民 一 般 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the people made their way back to the town quietly and secretly, as those who are shamed go secretly when they go in flight from the war. 
<br>19:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 王 蒙 着 脸 ， 大 声 哭 号 说 ， 我 儿 押 沙 龙 阿 。 押 沙 龙 ， 我 儿 ， 我 儿 阿 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son! 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But the king, covering his face, gave a great cry, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son! 
<br>19:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 押 进 去 见 王 ， 说 ， 你 今 日 使 你 一 切 仆 人 脸 面 惭 愧 了 。 他 们 今 日 救 了 你 的 性 命 和 你 儿 女 妻 妾 的 性 命 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Joab came into the house to the king and said, Today you have put to shame the faces of all your servants who even now have kept you and your sons and your daughters and your wives and all your women safe from death; 
<br>19:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 却 爱 那 恨 你 的 人 ， 恨 那 爱 你 的 人 。 你 今 日 明 明 地 不 以 将 帅 ， 仆 人 为 念 。 我 今 日 看 明 ， 若 押 沙 龙 活 着 ， 我 们 都 死 亡 ， 你 就 喜 悦 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For your haters, it seems, are dear to you, and your friends are hated. For you have made it clear that captains and servants are nothing to you: and now I see that if Absalom was living and we had all been dead today, it would have been right in your eyes. 
<br>19:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 现 在 你 当 出 去 ， 安 慰 你 仆 人 的 心 。 我 指 着 耶 和 华 起 誓 ， 你 若 不 出 去 ， 今 夜 必 无 一 人 与 你 同 在 一 处 。 这 祸 患 就 比 你 从 幼 年 到 如 今 所 遭 的 更 甚 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So get up now, and go out and say some kind words to your servants; for, by the Lord, I give you my oath, that if you do not go out, not one of them will keep with you tonight; and that will be worse for you than all the evil which has overtaken you from your earliest years. 
<br>19:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 王 起 来 ， 坐 在 城 门 口 。 众 民 听 说 王 坐 在 城 门 口 ， 就 都 到 王 面 前 。 以 色 列 人 已 经 逃 跑 ， 各 回 各 家 去 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the king got up and took his seat near the town-door. And word was given to all the people that the king was in the public place: and all the people came before the king. Now all the men of Israel had gone back in flight to their tents. 
<br>19:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 色 列 众 支 派 的 人 纷 纷 议 论 说 ， 王 曾 救 我 们 脱 离 仇 敌 的 手 ， 又 救 我 们 脱 离 非 利 士 人 的 手 ， 现 在 他 躲 避 押 沙 龙 逃 走 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And through all the tribes of Israel the people were having arguments, saying, The king made us safe from the hands of those who were against us and made us free from the hands of the Philistines; and now he has gone in flight from the land, because of Absalom. 
<br>19:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 们 膏 押 沙 龙 治 理 我 们 ， 他 已 经 阵 亡 。 现 在 为 什 么 不 出 一 言 请 王 回 来 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Absalom, whom we made a ruler over us, is dead in the fight. So now why do you say nothing about getting the king back? And word of what all Israel was saying came to the king. 
<br>19:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 王 差 人 去 见 祭 司 撒 督 和 亚 比 亚 他 ， 说 ， 你 们 当 向 犹 大 长 老 说 ， 以 色 列 众 人 已 经 有 话 请 王 回 宫 ， 你 们 为 什 么 落 在 他 们 后 头 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And King David sent word to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, Say to the responsible men of Judah, Why are you the last to take steps to get the king back to his house? 
<br>19:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 们 是 我 的 弟 兄 ， 是 我 的 骨 肉 ， 为 什 么 在 人 后 头 请 王 回 来 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; You are my brothers, my bone and my flesh; why are you the last to get the king back again? 
<br>19:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 也 要 对 亚 玛 撒 说 ， 你 不 是 我 的 骨 肉 吗 ？ 我 若 不 立 你 替 约 押 常 作 元 帅 ， 愿 神 重 重 地 降 罚 与 我 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And say to Amasa, Are you not my bone and my flesh? May God's punishment be on me, if I do not make you chief of the army before me at all times in place of Joab! 
<br>19:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 如 此 就 挽 回 犹 大 众 人 的 心 ， 如 同 一 人 的 心 。 他 们 便 打 发 人 去 见 王 ， 说 ， 请 王 和 王 的 一 切 臣 仆 回 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the hearts of the men of Judah were moved like one man; so that they sent to the king, saying, Come back, with all your servants. 
<br>19:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 王 就 回 来 ， 到 了 约 旦 河 。 犹 大 人 来 到 吉 甲 ， 要 去 迎 接 王 ， 请 他 过 约 旦 河 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So the king came back, and came as far as Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, meeting the king there, to take him back with them over Jordan. 
<br>19:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 巴 户 琳 的 便 雅 悯 人 ， 基 拉 的 儿 子 示 每 急 忙 与 犹 大 人 一 同 下 去 迎 接 大 卫 王 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Shimei, the son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, got up quickly and went down with the men of Judah for the purpose of meeting King David; 
<br>19:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 跟 从 示 每 的 有 一 千 便 雅 悯 人 ， 还 有 扫 罗 家 的 仆 人 洗 巴 和 他 十 五 个 儿 子 ， 二 十 个 仆 人 。 他 们 都 趟 过 约 旦 河 迎 接 王 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And with him a thousand men of Benjamin, and Ziba, the servant of Saul, with his fifteen sons and twenty servants, came rushing to Jordan before the king, 
<br>19:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 有 摆 渡 船 过 去 ， 渡 王 的 家 眷 ， 任 王 使 用 。 王 要 过 约 旦 河 的 时 候 ， 基 拉 的 儿 子 示 每 就 俯 伏 在 王 面 前 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And kept going across the river to take the people of the king's house over, and to do whatever was desired by the king. And Shimei, the son of Gera, went down on his face in the dust before the king, when he was about to go over Jordan, 
<br>19:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 对 王 说 ， 我 主 我 王 出 耶 路 撒 冷 的 时 候 ， 仆 人 行 悖 逆 的 事 ， 现 在 求 我 主 不 要 因 此 加 罪 与 仆 人 ， 不 要 记 念 ， 也 不 要 放 在 心 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And said to him, Let me not be judged as a sinner in your eyes, O my lord, and do not keep in mind the wrong I did on the day when my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, or take it to heart. 
<br>19:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 仆 人 明 知 自 己 有 罪 ， 所 以 约 瑟 全 家 之 中 ， 今 日 我 首 先 下 来 迎 接 我 主 我 王 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For your servant is conscious of his sin: and so, as you see, I have come today, the first of all the sons of Joseph, for the purpose of meeting my lord the king. 
<br>19:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 洗 鲁 雅 的 儿 子 亚 比 筛 说 ， 示 每 既 咒 骂 耶 和 华 的 受 膏 者 ， 不 应 当 治 死 他 吗 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's anointed? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, said, Is not death the right fate for Shimei, because he has been cursing the one marked by the holy oil? 
<br>19:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 说 ， 洗 鲁 雅 的 儿 子 ， 我 与 你 们 有 何 关 涉 ， 使 你 们 今 日 与 我 反 对 呢 ？ 今 日 在 以 色 列 中 岂 可 治 死 人 呢 ？ 我 岂 不 知 今 日 我 作 以 色 列 的 王 吗 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And David said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you put yourselves against me today? is it right for any man in Israel to be put to death today? for I am certain today that I am king in Israel. 
<br>19:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 王 对 示 每 说 ， 你 必 不 死 。 王 就 向 他 起 誓 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So the king said to Shimei, You will not be put to death. And the king gave him his oath. 
<br>19:24 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 的 孙 子 米 非 波 设 也 下 去 迎 接 王 。 他 自 从 王 去 的 日 子 ， 直 到 王 平 平 安 安 地 回 来 ， 没 有 修 脚 ， 没 有 剃 胡 须 ， 也 没 有 洗 衣 服 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Mephibosheth, the son of Saul's son, came down for the purpose of meeting the king; his feet had not been cared for or his hair cut or his clothing washed from the day when the king went away till the day when he came back in peace. 
<br>19:25 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 来 到 耶 路 撒 冷 迎 接 王 的 时 候 ， 王 问 他 说 ， 米 非 波 设 ， 你 为 什 么 没 有 与 我 同 去 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now when he had come from Jerusalem to see the king, the king said to him, Why did you not come with me, Mephibosheth? 
<br>19:26 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 回 答 说 ， 我 主 我 王 ， 仆 人 是 瘸 腿 的 。 那 日 我 想 要 备 驴 骑 上 ， 与 王 同 去 ， 无 奈 我 的 仆 人 欺 哄 了 我 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said in answer, Because of the deceit of my servant, my lord king: for I, your servant, said to him, You are to make ready an ass and on it I will go with the king, for your servant has not the use of his feet. 
<br>19:27 [hgb]&nbsp; 又 在 我 主 我 王 面 前 谗 毁 我 。 然 而 我 主 我 王 如 同 神 的 使 者 一 般 ， 你 看 怎 样 好 ， 就 怎 样 行 吧 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; He has given you a false account of me: but my lord the king is like the angel of God: do then whatever seems good to you. 
<br>19:28 [hgb]&nbsp; 因 为 我 祖 全 家 的 人 ， 在 我 主 我 王 面 前 都 算 为 死 人 ， 王 却 使 仆 人 在 王 的 席 上 同 人 吃 饭 ， 我 现 在 向 王 还 能 辨 理 诉 冤 吗 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For all my father's family were only dead men before my lord the king: and still you put your servant among those whose place is at the king's table. What right then have I to say anything more to the king? 
<br>19:29 [hgb]&nbsp; 王 对 他 说 ， 你 何 必 再 提 你 的 事 呢 ？ 我 说 ， 你 与 洗 巴 均 分 地 土 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the king said, Say nothing more about these things. I say, Let there be a division of the land between Ziba and you. 
<br>19:30 [hgb]&nbsp; 米 非 波 设 对 王 说 ， 我 主 我 王 既 平 平 安 安 地 回 宫 ， 就 任 凭 洗 巴 都 取 了 也 可 以 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Mephibosheth said, Let him take it all, now that my lord the king has come back to his house in peace! 
<br>19:31 [hgb]&nbsp; 基 列 人 巴 西 莱 从 罗 基 琳 下 来 ， 要 送 王 过 约 旦 河 ， 就 与 王 一 同 过 了 约 旦 河 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went on as far as Jordan with the king to take him across Jordan. 
<br>19:32 [hgb]&nbsp; 巴 西 莱 年 纪 老 迈 ， 已 经 八 十 岁 了 。 王 住 在 玛 哈 念 的 时 候 ， 他 就 拿 食 物 来 供 给 王 。 他 原 是 大 富 户 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now Barzillai was a very old man, as much as eighty years old: and he had given the king everything he had need of, while he was at Mahanaim, for he was a very great man. 
<br>19:33 [hgb]&nbsp; 王 对 巴 西 莱 说 ， 你 与 我 同 去 ， 我 要 在 耶 路 撒 冷 那 里 养 你 的 老 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the king said to Barzillai, Come over with me, and I will take care of you in Jerusalem. 
<br>19:34 [hgb]&nbsp; 巴 西 莱 对 王 说 ， 我 在 世 的 年 日 还 能 有 多 少 ， 使 我 与 王 同 上 耶 路 撒 冷 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Barzillai said to the king, How much of my life is still before me, for me to go up to Jerusalem with the king? 
<br>19:35 [hgb]&nbsp; 仆 人 现 在 八 十 岁 了 ， 还 能 尝 出 饮 食 的 滋 味 ， 辨 别 美 恶 吗 ？ 还 能 听 男 女 歌 唱 的 声 音 吗 ？ 仆 人 何 必 累 赘 我 主 我 王 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; I am now eighty years old: good and bad are the same to me; have meat and drink any taste for me now? am I able to take pleasure in the voices of men or women in song? why then am I to be a trouble to my lord the king? 
<br>19:36 [hgb]&nbsp; 仆 人 只 要 送 王 过 约 旦 河 ， 王 何 必 赐 我 这 样 的 恩 典 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Your servant's desire was only to take the king over Jordan; why is the king to give me such a reward? 
<br>19:37 [hgb]&nbsp; 求 你 准 我 回 去 ， 好 死 在 我 本 城 ， 葬 在 我 父 母 的 墓 旁 。 这 里 有 王 的 仆 人 金 罕 ， 让 他 同 我 主 我 王 过 去 ， 可 以 随 意 待 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Let your servant now go back again, so that when death comes to me, it may be in my town and by the resting-place of my father and mother. But here is your servant Chimham: let him go with my lord the king, and do for him what seems good to you. 
<br>19:38 [hgb]&nbsp; 王 说 ， 金 罕 可 以 与 我 同 去 ， 我 必 照 你 的 心 愿 待 他 。 你 向 我 求 什 么 ， 我 都 必 为 你 成 就 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the king said in answer, Let Chimham go over with me, and I will do for him whatever seems good to you: and whatever your desire is, I will do it for you. 
<br>19:39 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 众 民 过 约 旦 河 ， 王 也 过 去 。 王 与 巴 西 莱 亲 嘴 ， 为 他 祝 福 ， 巴 西 莱 就 回 本 地 去 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then all the people went over Jordan, and the king went over: and the king gave Barzillai a kiss, with his blessing; and he went back to his place. 
<br>19:40 [hgb]&nbsp; 王 过 去 ， 到 了 吉 甲 ， 金 罕 也 跟 他 过 去 。 犹 大 众 民 和 以 色 列 民 的 一 半 也 都 送 王 过 去 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went with him: and all the people of Judah, as well as half the people of Israel, took the king on his way. 
<br>19:41 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 色 列 众 人 来 见 王 ， 对 他 说 ， 我 们 弟 兄 犹 大 人 为 什 么 暗 暗 送 王 和 王 的 家 眷 ， 并 跟 随 王 的 人 过 约 旦 河 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the men of Israel came to the king and said, Why have our countrymen of Judah taken you away in secret and come over Jordan with the king and all his family, because all his people are David's men? 
<br>19:42 [hgb]&nbsp; 犹 大 众 人 回 答 以 色 列 人 说 ， 因 为 王 与 我 们 是 亲 属 ， 你 们 为 何 因 这 事 发 怒 呢 ？ 我 们 吃 了 王 的 什 么 呢 ？ 王 赏 赐 了 我 们 什 么 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath he given us any gift? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And all the men of Judah gave this answer to the men of Israel, Because the king is our near relation: why then are you angry about this? have we taken any of the king's food, or has he given us any offering? 
<br>19:43 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 色 列 人 回 答 犹 大 人 说 ， 按 支 派 ， 我 们 与 王 有 十 分 的 情 分 。 在 大 卫 身 上 ， 我 们 也 比 你 们 更 有 情 分 。 你 们 为 何 藐 视 我 们 ， 请 王 回 来 不 先 与 我 们 商 量 呢 ？ 但 犹 大 人 的 话 比 以 色 列 人 的 话 更 硬 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And in answer to the men of Judah, the men of Israel said, We have ten parts in the king, and we are the first in order of birth: why did you make nothing of us? and were we not the first to make suggestions for getting the king back? And the words of the men of Judah were more violent than the words of the men of Israel.
