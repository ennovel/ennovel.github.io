The hills were clothed in the fresh foliage of spring now,and were a gracious and worthy setting for the broad river flowing between.
<br> 
<br> Our trip began auspiciously, with a perfect day, as to breeze and sunshine,and our boat threw the miles out behind her with satisfactory despatch.
<br> 
<br> We found a railway intruding at Chester, Illinois; Chester hasalso a penitentiary now, and is otherwise marching on. At GrandTower, too, there was a railway; and another at Cape Girardeau.
<br> 
<br> The former town gets its name from a huge, squat pillar of rock,which stands up out of the water on the Missouri side of the river--a piece of nature's fanciful handiwork--and is one of themost picturesque features of the scenery of that region.
<br> 
<br> For nearer or remoter neighbors, the Tower has the Devil'sBake Oven--so called, perhaps, because it does not powerfullyresemble anybody else's bake oven; and the Devil's Tea Table--this latter a great smooth-surfaced mass of rock, with diminishingwine-glass stem, perched some fifty or sixty feet above the river,beside a beflowered and garlanded precipice, and sufficientlylike a tea-table to answer for anybody, Devil or Christian.
<br> 
<br> Away down the river we have the Devil's Elbow and the Devil'sRace-course, and lots of other property of his which I cannot nowcall to mind.
<br> 
<br> The Town of Grand Tower was evidently a busier place than ithad been in old times, but it seemed to need some repairshere and there, and a new coat of whitewash all over.
<br> 
<br> Still, it was pleasant to me to see the old coat once more.
<br> 
<br> 'Uncle' Mumford, our second officer, said the place had beensuffering from high water, and consequently was not lookingits best now. But he said it was not strange that it didn'twaste white-wash on itself, for more lime was made there,and of a better quality, than anywhere in the West;and added--'On a dairy farm you never can get any milkfor your coffee, nor any sugar for it on a sugar plantation;and it is against sense to go to a lime town to hunt for white-wash.'
<br> 
<br> In my own experience I knew the first two items to be true;and also that people who sell candy don't care for candy;therefore there was plausibility in Uncle Mumford's final observationthat 'people who make lime run more to religion than whitewash.'
<br> 
<br> Uncle Mumford said, further, that Grand Tower was a great coalingcenter and a prospering place.
<br> 
<br> Cape Girardeau is situated on a hillside, and makes a handsome appearance.
<br> 
<br> There is a great Jesuit school for boys at the foot of the town by the river.
<br> 
<br> Uncle Mumford said it had as high a reputation for thoroughness as anysimilar institution in Missouri ' There was another college higher up onan airy summit--a bright new edifice, picturesquely and peculiarly toweredand pinnacled--a sort of gigantic casters, with the cruets all complete.
<br> 
<br> Uncle Mumford said that Cape Girardeau was the Athens of Missouri,and contained several colleges besides those already mentioned; and all ofthem on a religious basis of one kind or another. He directed my attentionto what he called the 'strong and pervasive religious look of the town,'
<br> 
<br> but I could not see that it looked more religious than the other hilltowns with the same slope and built of the same kind of bricks.
<br> 
<br> Partialities often make people see more than really exists.
<br> 
<br> Uncle Mumford has been thirty years a mate on the river.
<br> 
<br> He is a man of practical sense and a level head; has observed;has had much experience of one sort and another; has opinions;has, also, just a perceptible dash of poetry in his composition,an easy gift of speech, a thick growl in his voice, and an oathor two where he can get at them when the exigencies of hisoffice require a spiritual lift. He is a mate of the blessedold-time kind; and goes gravely damning around, when thereis work to the fore, in a way to mellow the ex-steamboatman'sheart with sweet soft longings for the vanished days that shallcome no more. 'GIT up there you! Going to be all day?
<br> 
<br> Why d'n't you SAY you was petrified in your hind legs,before you shipped!'
<br> 
<br> He is a steady man with his crew; kind and just, but firm;so they like him, and stay with him. He is still in the slouchygarb of the old generation of mates; but next trip the AnchorLine will have him in uniform--a natty blue naval uniform,with brass buttons, along with all the officers of the line--and then he will be a totally different style of scenery from whathe is now.
<br> 
<br> Uniforms on the Mississippi! It beats all the other changesput together, for surprise. Still, there is another surprise--that it was not made fifty years ago. It is so manifestly sensible,that it might have been thought of earlier, one would suppose.
<br> 
<br> During fifty years, out there, the innocent passenger in needof help and information, has been mistaking the mate forthe cook, and the captain for the barber--and being roughlyentertained for it, too. But his troubles are ended now.
<br> 
<br> And the greatly improved aspect of the boat's staff is anotheradvantage achieved by the dress-reform period.
<br> 
<br> Steered down the bend below Cape Girardeau. They used to call it'Steersman's Bend;' plain sailing and plenty of water in it, always;about the only place in the Upper River that a new cub was allowedto take a boat through, in low water.
<br> 
<br> Thebes, at the head of the Grand Chain, and Commerce at the footof it, were towns easily rememberable, as they had not undergoneconspicuous alteration. Nor the Chain, either--in the natureof things; for it is a chain of sunken rocks admirablyarranged to capture and kill steamboats on bad nights.
<br> 
<br> A good many steamboat corpses lie buried there, out of sight;among the rest my first friend the 'Paul Jones;' she knocked herbottom out, and went down like a pot, so the historian told me--Uncle Mumford. He said she had a gray mare aboard, and a preacher.
<br> 
<br> To me, this sufficiently accounted for the disaster; as it did,of course, to Mumford, who added--'But there are many ignorant people who would scoff at sucha matter, and call it superstition. But you will always noticethat they are people who have never traveled with a gray mareand a preacher. I went down the river once in such company.
<br> 
<br> We grounded at Bloody Island; we grounded at Hanging Dog;we grounded just below this same Commerce; we jolted BeaverDam Rock; we hit one of the worst breaks in the 'Graveyard'
<br> 
<br> behind Goose Island; we had a roustabout killed in a fight;we burnt a boiler; broke a shaft; collapsed a flue; and went intoCairo with nine feet of water in the hold--may have been more,may have been less. I remember it as if it were yesterday.
<br> 
<br> The men lost their heads with terror. They painted the mare blue,in sight of town, and threw the preacher overboard, or we shouldnot have arrived at all. The preacher was fished out and saved.
<br> 
<br> He acknowledged, himself, that he had been to blame.
<br> 
<br> I remember it all, as if it were yesterday.'
<br> 
<br> That this combination--of preacher and gray mare--should breed calamity,seems strange, and at first glance unbelievable; but the fact is fortifiedby so much unassailable proof that to doubt is to dishonor reason.
<br> 
<br> I myself remember a case where a captain was warned by numerous friendsagainst taking a gray mare and a preacher with him, but persisted in hispurpose in spite of all that could be said; and the same day--it may havebeen the next, and some say it was, though I think it was the same day--he got drunk and fell down the hatchway, and was borne to his home a corpse.
<br> 
<br> This is literally true.
<br> 
<br> No vestige of Hat Island is left now; every shred of it is washed away.
<br> 
<br> I do not even remember what part of the river it used to be in,except that it was between St. Louis and Cairo somewhere.
<br> 
<br> It was a bad region--all around and about Hat Island, in early days.
<br> 
<br> A farmer who lived on the Illinois shore there, said that twenty-ninesteamboats had left their bones strung along within sight from his house.
<br> 
<br> Between St. Louis and Cairo the steamboat wrecks average one to the mile;--two hundred wrecks, altogether.
<br> 
<br> I could recognize big changes from Commerce down. Beaver Dam Rock wasout in the middle of the river now, and throwing a prodigious 'break;'
<br> 
<br> it used to be close to the shore, and boats went down outside of it.
<br> 
<br> A big island that used to be away out in mid-river, has retiredto the Missouri shore, and boats do not go near it any more.
<br> 
<br> The island called Jacket Pattern is whittled down to a wedge now,and is booked for early destruction. Goose Island is all gonebut a little dab the size of a steamboat. The perilous 'Graveyard,'
<br> 
<br> among whose numberless wrecks we used to pick our way so slowlyand gingerly, is far away from the channel now, and a terror to nobody.
<br> 
<br> One of the islands formerly called the Two Sisters is gone entirely;the other, which used to lie close to the Illinois shore, is now onthe Missouri side, a mile away; it is joined solidly to the shore,and it takes a sharp eye to see where the seam is--but it isIllinois ground yet, and the people who live on it have to ferrythemselves over and work the Illinois roads and pay Illinois taxes:
<br> 
<br> singular state of things!
<br> 
<br> Near the mouth of the river several islands were missing--washed away.
<br> 
<br> Cairo was still there--easily visible across the long, flat point uponwhose further verge it stands; but we had to steam a long way aroundto get to it. Night fell as we were going out of the 'Upper River'
<br> 
<br> and meeting the floods of the Ohio. We dashed along without anxiety;for the hidden rock which used to lie right in the way has moved upstream a long distance out of the channel; or rather, about one countyhas gone into the river from the Missouri point, and the Cairo point has'made down' and added to its long tongue of territory correspondingly.
<br> 
<br> The Mississippi is a just and equitable river; it never tumbles one man's farmoverboard without building a new farm just like it for that man's neighbor.
<br> 
<br> This keeps down hard feelings.
<br> 
<br> Going into Cairo, we came near killing a steamboat which paidno attention to our whistle and then tried to cross our bows.
<br> 
<br> By doing some strong backing, we saved him; which was a great loss,for he would have made good literature.
<br> 
<br> Cairo is a brisk town now; and is substantially built, and has a citylook about it which is in noticeable contrast to its former estate,as per Mr. Dickens's portrait of it. However, it was alreadybuilding with bricks when I had seen it last--which was when Colonel(now General) Grant was drilling his first command there.
<br> 
<br> Uncle Mumford says the libraries and Sunday-schools havedone a good work in Cairo, as well as the brick masons.
<br> 
<br> Cairo has a heavy railroad and river trade, and her situation atthe junction of the two great rivers is so advantageous that shecannot well help prospering.
<br> 
<br> When I turned out, in the morning, we had passed Columbus, Kentucky,and were approaching Hickman, a pretty town, perched on a handsome hill.
<br> 
<br> Hickman is in a rich tobacco region, and formerly enjoyed a greatand lucrative trade in that staple, collecting it there in herwarehouses from a large area of country and shipping it by boat;but Uncle Mumford says she built a railway to facilitate this commercea little more, and he thinks it facilitated it the wrong way--took the bulk of the trade out of her hands by 'collaring it alongthe line without gathering it at her doors.'
