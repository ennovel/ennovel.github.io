<br> 
<br> I am to this day profiting somewhat by that experience;for in that brief, sharp schooling, I got personally and familiarlyacquainted with about all the different types of human naturethat are to be found in fiction, biography, or history.
<br> 
<br> The fact is daily borne in upon me, that the average shore-employmentrequires as much as forty years to equip a man with this sortof an education. When I say I am still profiting by this thing,I do not mean that it has constituted me a judge of men--no, it has not done that; for judges of men are born, not made.
<br> 
<br> My profit is various in kind and degree; but the feature of itwhich I value most is the zest which that early experience hasgiven to my later reading. When I find a well-drawn characterin fiction or biography, I generally take a warm personalinterest in him, for the reason that I have known him before--met him on the river.
<br> 
<br> The figure that comes before me oftenest, out of the shadows of thatvanished time, is that of Brown, of the steamer 'Pennsylvania'--the manreferred to in a former chapter, whose memory was so good and tiresome.
<br> 
<br> He was a middle-aged, long, slim, bony, smooth-shaven, horse-faced, ignorant,stingy, malicious, snarling, fault hunting, mote-magnifying tyrant.
<br> 
<br> I early got the habit of coming on watch with dread at my heart.
<br> 
<br> No matter how good a time I might have been having with the off-watch below,and no matter how high my spirits might be when I started aloft, my soulbecame lead in my body the moment I approached the pilot-house.
<br> 
<br> I still remember the first time I ever entered the presence of that man.
<br> 
<br> The boat had backed out from St. Louis and was 'straightening down;'
<br> 
<br> I ascended to the pilot-house in high feather, and very proudto be semi-officially a member of the executive family of so fastand famous a boat. Brown was at the wheel. I paused in the middleof the room, all fixed to make my bow, but Brown did not look around.
<br> 
<br> I thought he took a furtive glance at me out of the corner of his eye,but as not even this notice was repeated, I judged I had been mistaken.
<br> 
<br> By this time he was picking his way among some dangerous 'breaks' abreastthe woodyards; therefore it would not be proper to interrupt him; so Istepped softly to the high bench and took a seat.
<br> 
<br> There was silence for ten minutes; then my new boss turnedand inspected me deliberately and painstakingly from headto heel for about--as it seemed to me--a quarter of an hour.
<br> 
<br> After which he removed his countenance and I saw it no morefor some seconds; then it came around once more, and thisquestion greeted me--'Are you Horace Bigsby's cub?'
<br> 
<br> 'Yes, sir.'
<br> 
<br> After this there was a pause and another inspection. Then--'What's your name?'
<br> 
<br> I told him. He repeated it after me. It was probably the onlything he ever forgot; for although I was with him many monthshe never addressed himself to me in any other way than 'Here!'
<br> 
<br> and then his command followed.
<br> 
<br> 'Where was you born?'
<br> 
<br> 'In Florida, Missouri.'
<br> 
<br> A pause. Then--'Dern sight better staid there!'
<br> 
<br> By means of a dozen or so of pretty direct questions, he pumpedmy family history out of me.
<br> 
<br> The leads were going now, in the first crossing. This interruptedthe inquest. When the leads had been laid in, he resumed--'How long you been on the river?'
<br> 
<br> I told him. After a pause--'Where'd you get them shoes?'
<br> 
<br> I gave him the information.
<br> 
<br> 'Hold up your foot!'
<br> 
<br> I did so. He stepped back, examined the shoe minutely and contemptuously,scratching his head thoughtfully, tilting his high sugar-loaf hat well forwardto facilitate the operation, then ejaculated, 'Well, I'll be dod derned!'
<br> 
<br> and returned to his wheel.
<br> 
<br> What occasion there was to be dod derned about it is a thingwhich is still as much of a mystery to me now as it was then.
<br> 
<br> It must have been all of fifteen minutes--fifteen minutesof dull, homesick silence--before that long horse-faceswung round upon me again--and then, what a change!
<br> 
<br> It was as red as fire, and every muscle in it was working.
<br> 
<br> Now came this shriek--'Here!--You going to set there all day?'
<br> 
<br> I lit in the middle of the floor, shot there by the electricsuddenness of the surprise. As soon as I could get my voice I said,apologetically:--'I have had no orders, sir.'
<br> 
<br> 'You've had no ORDERS! My, what a fine bird we are! We must have ORDERS!
<br> 
<br> Our father was a GENTLEMAN--owned slaves--and we've been to SCHOOL.
<br> 
<br> Yes, WE are a gentleman, TOO, and got to have ORDERS! ORDERS, is it?
<br> 
<br> ORDERS is what you want! Dod dern my skin, I'LL learn you to swell yourselfup and blow around here about your dod-derned ORDERS! G'way from the wheel!
<br> 
<br> (I had approached it without knowing it.)I moved back a step or two, and stood as in a dream, all my sensesstupefied by this frantic assault.
<br> 
<br> 'What you standing there for? Take that ice-pitcher down tothe texas-tender-come, move along, and don't you be all day about it!'
<br> 
<br> The moment I got back to the pilot-house, Brown said--'Here! What was you doing down there all this time?'
<br> 
<br> 'I couldn't find the texas-tender; I had to go all the way to the pantry.'
<br> 
<br> 'Derned likely story! Fill up the stove.'
<br> 
<br> I proceeded to do so. He watched me like a cat.
<br> 
<br> Presently he shouted--'Put down that shovel? Deadest numskull I ever saw--ain't even got sense enough to load up a stove.
<br> 
<br> All through the watch this sort of thing went on. Yes, and thesubsequent watches were much like it, during a stretch of months.
<br> 
<br> As I have said, I soon got the habit of coming on duty with dread.
<br> 
<br> The moment I was in the presence, even in the darkest night,I could feel those yellow eyes upon me, and knew their ownerwas watching for a pretext to spit out some venom on me.
<br> 
<br> Preliminarily he would say-'Here! Take the wheel.'
<br> 
<br> Two minutes later--'WHERE in the nation you going to? Pull her down! pull her down!'
<br> 
<br> After another moment--'Say! You going to hold her all day? Let her go--meet her! meet her!'
<br> 
<br> Then he would jump from the bench, snatch the wheel from me,and meet her himself, pouring out wrath upon me all the time.
<br> 
<br> George Ritchie was the other pilot's cub. He was havinggood times now; for his boss, George Ealer, was as kindheartedas Brown wasn't. Ritchie had steeled for Brown the season before;consequently he knew exactly how to entertain himself and plague me,all by the one operation. Whenever I took the wheel for a momenton Ealer's watch, Ritchie would sit back on the bench and play Brown,with continual ejaculations of 'Snatch her! snatch her!
<br> 
<br> Derndest mud-cat I ever saw!' 'Here! Where you going NOW?
<br> 
<br> Going to run over that snag?' 'Pull her DOWN ! Don't you hear me?
<br> 
<br> Pull her DOWN!' 'There she goes! JUST as I expected!
<br> 
<br> I TOLD you not to cramp that reef G'way from the wheel!'
<br> 
<br> So I always had a rough time of it, no matter whose watch it was;and sometimes it seemed to me that Ritchie's good-natured badgeringwas pretty nearly as aggravating as Brown's dead-earnest nagging.
<br> 
<br> I often wanted to kill Brown, but this would not answer.
<br> 
<br> A cub had to take everything his boss gave, in the way ofvigorous comment and criticism; and we all believed that therewas a United States law making it a penitentiary offense tostrike or threaten a pilot who was on duty. However, I couldIMAGINE myself killing Brown; there was no law against that;and that was the thing I used always to do the moment I was abed.
<br> 
<br> Instead of going over my river in my mind as was my duty,I threw business aside for pleasure, and killed Brown.
<br> 
<br> I killed Brown every night for months; not in old, stale,commonplace ways, but in new and picturesque ones;--ways that weresometimes surprising for freshness of design and ghastliness ofsituation and environment.
<br> 
<br> Brown was ALWAYS watching for a pretext to find fault;and if he could find no plausible pretext, he would invent one.
<br> 
<br> He would scold you for shaving a shore, and for not shaving it;for hugging a bar, and for not hugging it; for 'pulling down'
<br> 
<br> when not invited, and for not pulling down when not invited;for firing up without orders, and for waiting FOR orders. In a word,it was his invariable rule to find fault with EVERYTHING you did;and another invariable rule of his was to throw all his remarks(to you) into the form of an insult.
<br> 
<br> One day we were approaching New Madrid, bound down and heavily laden.
<br> 
<br> Brown was at one side of the wheel, steering; I was at the other,standing by to 'pull down' or 'shove up.' He cast a furtive glance at meevery now and then. I had long ago learned what that meant; viz., he wastrying to invent a trap for me. I wondered what shape it was going to take.
<br> 
<br> By and by he stepped back from the wheel and said in his usual snarly way--'Here!--See if you've got gumption enough to round her to.'
<br> 
<br> This was simply BOUND to be a success; nothing could prevent it;for he had never allowed me to round the boat to before;consequently, no matter how I might do the thing, he couldfind free fault with it. He stood back there with his greedyeye on me, and the result was what might have been foreseen:
<br> 
<br> I lost my head in a quarter of a minute, and didn't know what Iwas about; I started too early to bring the boat around,but detected a green gleam of joy in Brown's eye, and correctedmy mistake; I started around once more while too high up,but corrected myself again in time; I made other false moves,and still managed to save myself; but at last I grew so confusedand anxious that I tumbled into the very worst blunder of all--I got too far down before beginning to fetch the boat around.
<br> 
<br> Brown's chance was come.
<br> 
<br> His face turned red with passion; he made one bound,hurled me across the house with a sweep of his arm,spun the wheel down, and began to pour out a stream ofvituperation upon me which lasted till he was out of breath.
<br> 
<br> In the course of this speech he called me all the differentkinds of hard names he could think of, and once or twice Ithought he was even going to swear--but he didn't this time.
<br> 
<br> 'Dod dern' was the nearest he ventured to the luxury of swearing,for he had been brought up with a wholesome respect for futurefire and brimstone.
<br> 
<br> That was an uncomfortable hour; for there was a big audienceon the hurricane deck. When I went to bed that night,I killed Brown in seventeen different ways-all of them new.
