The pilot inspected me;I re-inspected the pilot. These customary preliminaries over, I satdown on the high bench, and he faced about and went on with his work.
<br> 
<br> Every detail of the pilot-house was familiar to me, with one exception,--a large-mouthed tube under the breast-board. I puzzled over that thing aconsiderable time; then gave up and asked what it was for.
<br> 
<br> 'To hear the engine-bells through.'
<br> 
<br> It was another good contrivance which ought to have been inventedhalf a century sooner. So I was thinking, when the pilot asked--'Do you know what this rope is for?'
<br> 
<br> I managed to get around this question, without committing myself.
<br> 
<br> 'Is this the first time you were ever in a pilot-house?'
<br> 
<br> I crept under that one.
<br> 
<br> 'Where are you from?'
<br> 
<br> 'New England.'
<br> 
<br> 'First time you have ever been West?'
<br> 
<br> I climbed over this one.
<br> 
<br> 'If you take an interest in such things, I can tell you what allthese things are for.'
<br> 
<br> I said I should like it.
<br> 
<br> 'This,' putting his hand on a backing-bell rope, 'is to sound the fire-alarm;this,' putting his hand on a go-ahead bell, 'is to call the texas-tender;this one,' indicating the whistle-lever, 'is to call the captain'--and so he went on, touching one object after another, and reeling offhis tranquil spool of lies.
<br> 
<br> I had never felt so like a passenger before.
<br> 
<br> I thanked him, with emotion, for each new fact, and wrote itdown in my note-book. The pilot warmed to his opportunity,and proceeded to load me up in the good old-fashioned way.
<br> 
<br> At times I was afraid he was going to rupture his invention;but it always stood the strain, and he pulled through all right.
<br> 
<br> He drifted, by easy stages, into revealments of the river'smarvelous eccentricities of one sort and another,and backed them up with some pretty gigantic illustrations.
<br> 
<br> For instance-'Do you see that little boulder sticking out of the water yonder? well,when I first came on the river, that was a solid ridge of rock,over sixty feet high and two miles long. All washed away but that.'
<br> 
<br> [This with a sigh.)I had a mighty impulse to destroy him, but it seemed to me that killing,in any ordinary way, would be too good for him.
<br> 
<br> Once, when an odd-looking craft, with a vast coal-scuttle slantingaloft on the end of a beam, was steaming by in the distance,he indifferently drew attention to it, as one might to an objectgrown wearisome through familiarity, and observed that it wasan 'alligator boat.'
<br> 
<br> 'An alligator boat? What's it for?'
<br> 
<br> 'To dredge out alligators with.'
<br> 
<br> 'Are they so thick as to be troublesome?'
<br> 
<br> 'Well, not now, because the Government keeps them down.
<br> 
<br> But they used to be. Not everywhere; but in favorite places,here and there, where the river is wide and shoal-like Plum Point,and Stack Island, and so on--places they call alligator beds.'
<br> 
<br> 'Did they actually impede navigation?'
<br> 
<br> 'Years ago, yes, in very low water; there was hardly a trip, then, that wedidn't get aground on alligators.'
<br> 
<br> It seemed to me that I should certainly have to get out my tomahawk.
<br> 
<br> However, I restrained myself and said--'It must have been dreadful.'
<br> 
<br> 'Yes, it was one of the main difficulties about piloting.
<br> 
<br> It was so hard to tell anything about the water; the damnedthings shift around so--never lie still five minutes at a time.
<br> 
<br> You can tell a wind-reef, straight off, by the look of it;you can tell a break; you can tell a sand-reef--that's all easy;but an alligator reef doesn't show up, worth anything.
<br> 
<br> Nine times in ten you can't tell where the water is;and when you do see where it is, like as not it ain't therewhen YOU get there, the devils have swapped around so, meantime.
<br> 
<br> Of course there were some few pilots that could judge ofalligator water nearly as well as they could of any other kind,but they had to have natural talent for it; it wasn't a thinga body could learn, you had to be born with it. Let me see:
<br> 
<br> there was Ben Thornburg, and Beck Jolly, and Squire Bell,and Horace Bixby, and Major Downing, and John Stevenson,and Billy Gordon, and Jim Brady, and George Ealer,and Billy Youngblood--all A 1 alligator pilots. THEY could tellalligator water as far as another Christian could tell whiskey.
<br> 
<br> Read it?--Ah, COULDN'T they, though! I only wish I had as manydollars as they could read alligator water a mile and a half off.
<br> 
<br> Yes, and it paid them to do it, too. A good alligator pilot couldalways get fifteen hundred dollars a month. Nights, other peoplehad to lay up for alligators, but those fellows never laidup for alligators; they never laid up for anything but fog.
<br> 
<br> They could SMELL the best alligator water it was said;I don't know whether it was so or not, and I think a body's gothis hands full enough if he sticks to just what he knows himself,without going around backing up other people's say-so's,though there's a plenty that ain't backward about doing it,as long as they can roust out something wonderful to tell.
<br> 
<br> Which is not the style of Robert Styles, by as much asthree fathom--maybe quarter-LESS.'
<br> 
<br> [My! Was this Rob Styles?--This mustached and stately figure?-A slimenough cub, in my time. How he has improved in comeliness in five-and-twentyyear and in the noble art of inflating his facts.] After these musings,I said aloud-'I should think that dredging out the alligators wouldn't have done much good,because they could come back again right away.'
<br> 
<br> 'If you had had as much experience of alligators as I have, you wouldn'ttalk like that. You dredge an alligator once and he's CONVINCED.
<br> 
<br> It's the last you hear of HIM. He wouldn't come back for pie.
<br> 
<br> If there's one thing that an alligator is more down on than another,it's being dredged. Besides, they were not simply shovedout of the way; the most of the scoopful were scooped aboard;they emptied them into the hold; and when they had got a trip,they took them to Orleans to the Government works.'
<br> 
<br> 'What for?'
<br> 
<br> 'Why, to make soldier-shoes out of their hides.
<br> 
<br> All the Government shoes are made of alligator hide.
<br> 
<br> It makes the best shoes in the world. They last five years,and they won't absorb water. The alligator fishery is aGovernment monopoly. All the alligators are Government property--just like the live-oaks. You cut down a live-oak, andGovernment fines you fifty dollars; you kill an alligator,and up you go for misprision of treason--lucky duck if theydon't hang you, too. And they will, if you're a Democrat.
<br> 
<br> The buzzard is the sacred bird of the South, and you can'ttouch him; the alligator is the sacred bird of the Government,and you've got to let him alone.'
<br> 
<br> 'Do you ever get aground on the alligators now?'
<br> 
<br> 'Oh, no! it hasn't happened for years.'
<br> 
<br> 'Well, then, why do they still keep the alligator boats in service?'
<br> 
<br> 'Just for police duty--nothing more. They merely go up and downnow and then. The present generation of alligators know themas easy as a burglar knows a roundsman; when they see one coming,they break camp and go for the woods.'
<br> 
<br> After rounding-out and finishing-up and polishing-off the alligator business,he dropped easily and comfortably into the historical vein, and told of sometremendous feats of half-a-dozen old-time steamboats of his acquaintance,dwelling at special length upon a certain extraordinary performance of hischief favorite among this distinguished fleet--and then adding--'That boat was the "Cyclone,"--last trip she ever made--she sunk,that very trip--captain was Tom Ballou, the most immortal liar that everI struck. He couldn't ever seem to tell the truth, in any kind of weather.
<br> 
<br> Why, he would make you fairly shudder. He WAS the most scandalous liar!
<br> 
<br> I left him, finally; I couldn't stand it. The proverb says, "like master,like man;" and if you stay with that kind of a man, you'll come undersuspicion by and by, just as sure as you live. He paid first-class wages;but said I, What's wages when your reputation's in danger? So I letthe wages go, and froze to my reputation. And I've never regretted it.
<br> 
<br> Reputation's worth everything, ain't it? That's the way I look at it.
<br> 
<br> He had more selfish organs than any seven men in the world--all packedin the stern-sheets of his skull, of course, where they belonged.
<br> 
<br> They weighed down the back of his head so that it made his nose tilt upin the air. People thought it was vanity, but it wasn't, it was malice.
<br> 
<br> If you only saw his foot, you'd take him to be nineteen feet high,but he wasn't; it was because his foot was out of drawing.
<br> 
<br> He was intended to be nineteen feet high, no doubt, if his footwas made first, but he didn't get there; he was only five feet ten.
<br> 
<br> That's what he was, and that's what he is. You take the lies out of him,and he'll shrink to the size of your hat; you take the malice out of him,and he'll disappear. That "Cyclone" was a rattler to go, and the sweetestthing to steer that ever walked the waters. Set her amidships,in a big river, and just let her go; it was all you had to do.
<br> 
<br> She would hold herself on a star all night, if you let her alone.
<br> 
<br> You couldn't ever feel her rudder. It wasn't any more labor to steerher than it is to count the Republican vote in a South Carolina election.
<br> 
<br> One morning, just at daybreak, the last trip she ever made, they tookher rudder aboard to mend it; I didn't know anything about it; I backedher out from the wood-yard and went a-weaving down the river all serene.
<br> 
<br> When I had gone about twenty-three miles, and made four horribly crookedcrossings----'
<br> 
<br> 'Without any rudder?'
<br> 
<br> 'Yes--old Capt. Tom appeared on the roof and began to find faultwith me for running such a dark night--'
<br> 
<br> 'Such a DARK NIGHT ?--Why, you said----'
<br> 
<br> 'Never mind what I said,--'twas as dark as Egypt now, though prettysoon the moon began to rise, and----'
<br> 
<br> 'You mean the SUN--because you started out just at break of---- look here!
<br> 
<br> Was this BEFORE you quitted the captain on account of his lying, or----'
<br> 
<br> 'It was before--oh, a long time before. And as I was saying, he----'
<br> 
<br> 'But was this the trip she sunk, or was----'
<br> 
<br> 'Oh, no!--months afterward. And so the old man, he----'
<br> 
<br> 'Then she made TWO last trips, because you said----'
<br> 
<br> He stepped back from the wheel, swabbing away his perspiration,and said--'Here!' (calling me by name), 'YOU take her and lie a while--you're handier at it than I am. Trying to play yourself for a strangerand an innocent!--why, I knew you before you had spoken seven words;and I made up my mind to find out what was your little game.
<br> 
<br> It was to DRAW ME OUT. Well, I let you, didn't I?
<br> 
<br> Now take the wheel and finish the watch; and next time play fair,and you won't have to work your passage.'
<br> 
<br> Thus ended the fictitious-name business. And not six hours outfrom St. Louis! but I had gained a privilege, any way, for I hadbeen itching to get my hands on the wheel, from the beginning.
<br> 
<br> I seemed to have forgotten the river, but I hadn't forgottenhow to steer a steamboat, nor how to enjoy it, either.
