<p>Well acquainted apparently with the way upstairs, the man thumped on a bed-room door, and shouted his message through it: “The master wants you, and mind you don’t keep him waiting.”</p> 
<p>The person sending this peremptory message was Sir Giles Mountjoy of Ardoon, knight and banker. The person receiving the message was Sir Giles’s head clerk. As a matter of course, Dennis Howmore dressed himself at full speed, and hastened to his employer’s private house on the outskirts of the town.</p> 
<p>He found Sir Giles in an irritable and anxious state of mind. A letter lay open on the banker’s bed, his night-cap was crumpled crookedly on his head, he was in too great a hurry to remember the claims of politeness, when the clerk said “Good morning.”</p> 
<p>“Dennis, I have got something for you to do. It must be kept a secret, and it allows of no delay.”</p> 
<p>“Is it anything connected with business, sir?”</p> 
<p>The banker lost his temper. “How can you be such an infernal fool as to suppose that anything connected with business could happen at this time in the morning? Do you know the first milestone on the road to Garvan?”</p> 
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p> 
<p>“Very well. Go to the milestone, and take care that nobody sees you when you get there. Look at the back of the stone. If you discover an Object which appears to have been left in that situation on the ground, bring it to me; and don’t forget that the most impatient man in all Ireland is waiting for you.”</p> 
<p>Not a word of explanation followed these extraordinary instructions.</p> 
<p>The head clerk set forth on his errand, with his mind dwelling on the national tendencies to conspiracy and assassination. His employer was not a popular person. Sir Giles had paid rent when he owed it; and, worse still, was disposed to remember in a friendly spirit what England had done for Ireland, in the course of the last fifty years. If anything appeared to justify distrust of the mysterious Object of which he was in search, Dennis resolved to be vigilantly on the look-out for a gun-barrel, whenever he passed a hedge on his return journey to the town.</p> 
<p>Arrived at the milestone, he discovered on the ground behind it one Object only — a fragment of a broken tea-cup.</p> 
<p>Naturally enough, Dennis hesitated. It seemed to be impossible that the earnest and careful instructions which he had received could relate to such a trifle as this. At the same time, he was acting under orders which were as positive as tone, manner, and language could make them. Passive obedience appeared to be the one safe course to take — at the risk of a reception, irritating to any man’s self-respect, when he returned to his employer with a broken teacup in his hand.</p> 
<p>The event entirely failed to justify his misgivings. There could be no doubt that Sir Giles attached serious importance to the contemptible discovery made at the milestone. After having examined and re-examined the fragment, he announced his intention of sending the clerk on a second errand — still without troubling himself to explain what his incomprehensible instructions meant.</p> 
<p>“If I am not mistaken,” he began, “the Reading Rooms, in our town, open as early as nine. Very well. Go to the Rooms this morning, on the stroke of the clock.” He stopped, and consulted the letter which lay open on his bed. “Ask the librarian,” he continued, “for the third volume of Gibbon’s ‘Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.’ Open the book at pages seventy-eight and seventy-nine. If you find a piece of paper between those two leaves, take possession of it when nobody is looking at you, and bring it to me. That’s all, Dennis. And bear in mind that I shall not recover the use of my patience till I see you again.”</p> 
<p>On ordinary occasions, the head clerk was not a man accustomed to insist on what was due to his dignity. At the same time he was a sensible human being, conscious of the consideration to which his responsible place in the office entitled him. Sir Giles’s irritating reserve, not even excused by a word of apology, reached the limits of his endurance. He respectfully protested.</p> 
<p>“I regret to find, sir,” he said, “that I have lost my place in my employer’s estimation. The man to whom you confide the superintendence of your clerks and the transaction of your business has, I venture to think, some claim (under the present circumstances) to be trusted.”</p> 
<p>The banker was now offended on his side.</p> 
<p>“I readily admit your claim,” he answered, “when you are sitting at your desk in my office. But, even in these days of strikes, co-operations, and bank holidays, an employer has one privilege left — he has not ceased to be a Man, and he has not forfeited a man’s right to keep his own secrets. I fail to see anything in my conduct which has given you just reason to complain.”</p> 
<p>Dennis, rebuked, made his bow in silence, and withdrew.</p> 
<p>Did these acts of humility mean that he submitted? They meant exactly the contrary. He had made up his mind that Sir Giles Mountjoy’s motives should, sooner or later, cease to be mysteries to Sir Giles Mountjoy’s clerk.</p>
