He laid his hairy hands on her shoulders, and kissed her on either cheek. After that prefatory act of endearment, he made his inquiries. What extraordinary combination of events had led Iris to leave London, and had brought her to visit him in his banking-house at Ardoon?</p> 
<p>“I wanted to get away from home,” she answered; “and having nobody to go to but my godfather, I thought I should like to see You.”</p> 
<p>“Alone!” cried Sir Giles.</p> 
<p>“No — with my maid to keep me company.”</p> 
<p>“Only your maid, Iris? Surely you have acquaintances among young ladies like yourself?”</p> 
<p>“Acquaintances — yes. No friends.”</p> 
<p>“Does your father approve of what you have done?”</p> 
<p>“Will you grant me a favour, godpapa?”</p> 
<p>“Yes — if I can.”</p> 
<p>“Don’t insist on my answering your last question.”</p> 
<p>The faint colour that had risen in her face, when she entered the room, left it. At the same time, the expression of her mouth altered. The lips closed firmly; revealing that strongest of all resolutions which is founded on a keen sense of wrong. She looked older than her age: what she might be ten years hence, she was now. Sir Giles understood her. He got up, and took a turn in the room. An old habit, of which he had cured himself with infinite difficulty when he was made a Knight, showed itself again. He put his hands in his pockets.</p> 
<p>“You and your father have had another quarrel,” he said, stopping opposite Iris.</p> 
<p>“I don’t deny it,” she replied.</p> 
<p>“Who is to blame?”</p> 
<p>She smiled bitterly. “The woman is always to blame.”</p> 
<p>“Did your father tell you that?”</p> 
<p>“My father reminded me that I was twenty-one years old, last birthday — and told me that I could do as I liked. I understood him, and I left the house.”</p> 
<p>“You will go back again, I suppose?”</p> 
<p>“I don’t know.”</p> 
<p>Sir Giles began pacing the room once more. His rugged face, telling its story of disaster and struggle in early life, showed signs of disappointment and distress.</p> 
<p>“Hugh promised to write to me,” he said, “and he has not written. I know what that means; I know what you have done to offend your father. My nephew has asked you to marry him for the second time. And for the second time you have refused.”</p> 
<p>Her face softened; its better and younger aspect revived. “Yes,” she said, sadly and submissively; “I have refused him again.”</p> 
<p>Sir Giles lost his temper. “What the devil is your objection to Hugh?” he burst out.</p> 
<p>“My father said the same thing to me,” she replied, “almost in the same words. I made him angry when I tried to give my reason. I don’t want to make you angry, too.”</p> 
<p>He took no notice of this. “Isn’t Hugh a good fellow?” he went on. “Isn’t he affectionate? and kindhearted? and honourable?— aye, and a handsome man too, if you come to that.”</p> 
<p>“Hugh is all that you say. I like him; I admire him; I owe to his kindness some of the happiest days of my sad life, and I am grateful — oh, with all my heart, I am grateful to Hugh!”</p> 
<p>“If that’s true, Iris ——”</p> 
<p>“Every word of it is true.”</p> 
<p>“I say, if that’s true — there’s no excuse for you. I hate perversity in a young woman! Why don’t you marry him?”</p> 
<p>“Try to feel for me,” she said gently; “I can’t love him.”</p> 
<p>Her tone said more to the banker than her words had expressed. The secret sorrow of her life, which was known to her father, was known also to Sir Giles.</p> 
<p>“Now we have come to it at last!” he said. “You can’t love my nephew Hugh. And you won’t tell me the reason why, because your sweet temper shrinks from making me angry. Shall I mention the reason for you, my dear? I can do it in two words — Lord Harry.”</p> 
<p>She made no reply; she showed no sign of feeling at what he had just said. Her head sank a little; her hands clasped themselves on her lap; the obstinate resignation which can submit to anything hardened her face, stiffened her figure — and that was all.</p> 
<p>The banker was determined not to spare her.</p> 
<p>“It’s easy to see,” he resumed, “that you have not got over your infatuation for that vagabond yet. Go where he may, into the vilest places and among the lowest people, he carries your heart along with him. I wonder you are not ashamed of such an attachment as that.”</p> 
<p>He had stung her at last. She roused herself, and answered him.</p> 
<p>“Harry has led a wild life,” she said; “he has committed serious faults, and he may live to do worse than he has done yet. To what degradation, bad company, and a bad bringing-up may yet lead him, I leave his enemies to foresee. But I tell you this, he has redeeming qualities which you, and people like you, are not good Christians enough to discover. He has friends who can still appreciate him — your nephew, Arthur Mountjoy, is one of them. Oh, I know it by Arthur’s letters to me! Blame Lord Harry as you may, I tell you he has the capacity for repentance in him, and one day — when it is too late, I dare say — he will show it. I can never be his wife. We are parted, never in all likelihood to meet again. Well, he is the only man whom I have ever loved; and he is the only man whom I ever shall love. If you think this state of mind proves that I am as bad as he is, I won’t contradict you. Do we any of us know how bad we are ——? Have you heard of Harry lately?”</p> 
<p>The sudden transition, from an earnest and devoted defence of the man, to an easy and familiar inquiry about him, startled Sir Giles.</p> 
<p>For the moment, he had nothing to say; Iris had made him think. She had shown a capacity for mastering her strongest feelings, at the moment when they threatened to overcome her, which is very rarely found in a young woman. How to manage her was a problem for patient resolution to solve. The banker’s obstinacy, rather than his conviction, had encouraged him to hold to the hope of Hugh’s marriage, even after his nephew had been refused for the second time. His headstrong goddaughter had come to visit him of her own accord. She had not forgotten the days of her childhood, when he had some influence over her — when she had found him kinder to her than her father had ever been. Sir Giles saw that he had taken the wrong tone with Iris. His anger had not alarmed her; his opinion had not influenced her. In Hugh’s interests, he determined to try what consideration and indulgence would do towards cultivating the growth of her regard for him. Finding that she had left her maid and her luggage at the hotel, he hospitably insisted on their removal to his own house.</p> 
<p>“While you are in Ardoon, Iris, you are my guest,” he said.</p> 
<p>She pleased him by readily accepting the invitation — and then annoyed him by asking again if he had heard anything of Lord Harry.</p> 
<p>He answered shortly and sharply: “I have heard nothing. What is your last news of him?”</p> 
<p>“News,” she said, “which I sincerely hope is not true. An Irish paper has been sent to me, which reports that he has joined the secret society — nothing better than a society of assassins, I am afraid — which is known by the name of the Invincibles.”</p> 
<p>As she mentioned that formidable brotherhood, Dennis Howmore returned from the police-office. He announced that a Sergeant was then waiting to receive instructions from Sir Giles.</p>
