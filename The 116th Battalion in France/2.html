The reasons for this were—Firstly, the recruiting system, by means of which men were gathered into the Battalions of the Expeditionary Force, through the different Militia Regiments; the majority of the overseas Battalions being formed by drafts from three, four, five and sometimes more different Regiments. Secondly, the method of reinforcement, which distributed officers and men to Battalions in France disregarding any other principle except that these officers and men were from the same Province as the Battalion to which they were going. And even this did not hold good at all times.
<br> 
<br> The fact remains, however, that the 116th Battalion was recruited and fostered in the County of Ontario and led to France and in France by an officer of the 34th Regiment. In consequence, a few details concerning the military history of that County and the parent regiment may be of interest to those members of the 116th who joined the Battalion from other parts of the Province and through other regiments.
<br> 
<br> [8]
<br> 
<br> The County of Ontario can justly claim credit to have been one of the first counties in the Province to recognize and fulfil its militia obligations, the first company of militia in the County being formed at Oshawa and known as The Oshawa Rifle Company.
<br> 
<br> Lieut. Colonel Bick, the Commanding Officer of the 34th Regiment, has in his possession a bugle with the following inscription:
<br> 
<br> “Presented by the Ladies of Oshawato the Oshawa
<br> Rifle Company on their return home from the
<br> Front, June 1866.”
<br> 
<br> The 34th Ontario County Regiment was organized in accordance with the general orders of September 14th, 1866, and was composed of ten companies and H.Q. as follows:—
<br> Battalion and Staff H.Q. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whitby
<br> No. 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Company &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whitby
<br> 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brooklin
<br> 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oshawa
<br> 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greenwood
<br> 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Port Perry
<br> 6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uxbridge
<br> 7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beaverton
<br> 8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pickering
<br> 9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Columbus
<br> 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cannington
<br> 
<br> Sometime afterwards the Battalion was reduced to seven companies, those at Greenwood, Port Perry and Columbus being eliminated.
<br> 
<br> [9]
<br> 
<br> In 1905 one more Company was added with Headquarters at Brechin and the distribution at the present time is as follows:—
<br> Regimental H.Q. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whitby
<br> A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Company &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oshawa
<br> B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whitby
<br> C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oshawa
<br> D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beaverton
<br> E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uxbridge
<br> F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Port Perry
<br> G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cannington
<br> H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oshawa.
<br> 
<br> During the Fenian Raids of 1866 and 1868, Ontario County contributed its quota and a number of Ontario County men saw service in the North-West Rebellion of 1885, some of whom are still living in the County.
<br> 
<br> When war broke out in August, 1914, recruiting centres were established throughout Ontario County, and almost immediately the 34th Regiment was asked to supply a draft of 125 men for the First Contingent.
<br> 
<br> So great was the response to the call for this draft that finally 7 officers and 200 other ranks went to Valcartier to join the 2nd and 4th Battalions.
<br> 
<br> During the interval between the departure of the First Contingent and the enrolling of the Second, a great deal of preparatory work was done, but recruiting was not the only military activity of the times, as there was considerable anxiety felt throughout the County regarding the attitude of the alien population.
<br> 
<br> [10]
<br> 
<br> The public buildings throughout the County were placed under guard, and upwards of 300 aliens were paroled and kept under surveillance. Great credit is due to Major A. F. Hind, at that time Chief of Police in Oshawa and later an officer in the 116th Battalion, for the efficient way in which this work was carried on.
<br> 
<br> During the month of May, 1915, Lieut. Colonel Bick, Officer Commanding the 34th Regiment, prior to his departure for Niagara with the 37th Overseas Battalion, appointed Captain G. W. P. Every of Whitby (later transferred to the 116th Battalion), to carry on recruiting throughout the County. Many small drafts of officers and men were despatched to the different overseas Battalions at that time being formed, including 27 other ranks to the 58th Battalion which was afterwards closely connected with the 116th in France; and so things went along until October, 1915, when the 116th Ontario County Battalion was authorized. Major S. S. Sharpe, second in command of the 34th Regiment, was given the command of the Battalion. Headquarters were established at Uxbridge with companies distributed as follows:—
<br> A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Company &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uxbridge &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major H. P. Cooke
<br> B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beaverton &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major F. H. Moody
<br> C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whitby &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major G. W. P. Every
<br> D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oshawa &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major A. F. Hind
<br> 
<br> Lieut.-Colonel Sharpe immediately set to work to enlist the sympathy and secure the co-operation of the citizens in all parts of the County.
<br> 
<br> A Civilian Recruiting League was formed and a[11] deputation sent to wait upon the County Council and ask for financial assistance. The County Council responded in a magnificent manner to the request and voted $5,000 to the 116th Battalion—$2,000 for the purchase of band instruments, and $3,000 for recruiting purposes.
<br> 
<br> Many other generous donations were made to the Battalion by the people of Ontario County including the Colours of the Battalion, which were carried through Belgium, with great pride, after the Armistice.
<br> 
<br> The progress made in recruiting during the winter was such that by May, 1916, the Battalion was 1,145 strong, and on the 23rd of July, 1916, set sail from Halifax for England on the old reliable H.M.T. “Olympic.”
