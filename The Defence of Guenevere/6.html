<p>What made me weep that day,</p> 
<p>When out of the council-hall</p>  
<p>Rapunzel, Rapunzel,</p>  
<p>Is it not true that every day</p> 
<p>She climbeth up the same strange way,</p> 
<p>Her scarlet cloak spread broad and gay,</p>  
<p>And left me there alone,</p> 
<p>To think on what they said:</p> 
<p>‘Thou art a king’s own son,</p>  
<p>Rapunzel, Rapunzel,</p>  
<p>When I undo the knotted mass,</p> 
<p>Fathoms below the shadows pass</p> 
<p>Over my hair along the grass.</p>  
<p>I put my armour on,</p> 
<p>Thinking on what they said:</p> 
<p>‘Thou art a king’s own son,</p>  
<p>Rapunzel, Rapunzel,</p>  
<p>See on the marble parapet,</p> 
<p>I lean my brow, strive to forget</p> 
<p>That fathoms below my hair grows wet</p>  
<p>I rode throughout the town,</p> 
<p>Men did not bow the head,</p> 
<p>Though I was the king’s own son:</p>  
<p>Rapunzel, Rapunzel,</p>  
<p>See on the marble parapet,</p> 
<p>The faint red stains with tears are wet;</p> 
<p>The long years pass, no help comes yet</p>  
<p>For leagues and leagues I rode,</p> 
<p>Till hot my armour grew,</p> 
<p>Till underneath the leaves</p>  
<p>Rapunzel, Rapunzel,</p>  
<p>And yet: but I am growing old,</p> 
<p>For want of love my heart is cold;</p> 
<p>Years pass, the while I loose and fold</p>  
<p>I have heard tales of men, who in the night</p> 
<p>Saw paths of stars let down to earth from heaven,</p> 
<p>Who followed them until they reach’d the light</p> 
<p>Wherein they dwell, whose sins are all forgiven;</p> 
<p>But who went backward when they saw the gate</p> 
<p>Of diamond, nor dared to enter in;</p> 
<p>All their life long they were content to wait,</p> 
<p>Purging them patiently of every sin.</p> 
<p>I must have had a dream of some such thing,</p> 
<p>And now am just awaking from that dream;</p> 
<p>For even in grey dawn those strange words ring</p> 
<p>Through heart and brain, and still I see that gleam.</p> 
<p>For in my dream at sunset-time I lay</p> 
<p>Beneath these beeches, mail and helmet off,</p> 
<p>Right full of joy that I had come away</p> 
<p>From court; for I was patient of the scoff</p> 
<p>That met me always there from day to day,</p> 
<p>From any knave or coward of them all:</p> 
<p>I was content to live that wretched way;</p> 
<p>For truly till I left the council-hall,</p> 
<p>And rode forth arm’d beneath the burning sun,</p> 
<p>My gleams of happiness were faint and few,</p> 
<p>But then I saw my real life had begun,</p> 
<p>And that I should be strong quite well I knew.</p> 
<p>For I was riding out to look for love,</p> 
<p>Therefore the birds within the thickets sung,</p> 
<p>Even in hot noontide; as I pass’d, above</p> 
<p>The elms o’ersway’d with longing towards me hung.</p> 
<p>Now some few fathoms from the place where I</p> 
<p>Lay in the beech-wood, was a tower fair,</p> 
<p>The marble corners faint against the sky;</p> 
<p>And dreamily I wonder’d what lived there:</p> 
<p>Because it seem’d a dwelling for a queen,</p> 
<p>No belfry for the swinging of great bells.</p> 
<p>No bolt or stone had ever crush’d the green</p> 
<p>Shafts, amber and rose walls, no soot that tells</p> 
<p>Of the Norse torches burning up the roofs,</p> 
<p>On the flower-carven marble could I see;</p> 
<p>But rather on all sides I saw the proofs</p> 
<p>Of a great loneliness that sicken’d me;</p> 
<p>Making me feel a doubt that was not fear,</p> 
<p>Whether my whole life long had been a dream,</p> 
<p>And I should wake up soon in some place, where</p> 
<p>The piled-up arms of the fighting angels gleam;</p> 
<p>Not born as yet, but going to be born,</p> 
<p>No naked baby as I was at first,</p> 
<p>But an armed knight, whom fire, hate and scorn</p> 
<p>Could turn from nothing: my heart almost burst</p> 
<p>Beneath the beeches, as I lay a-dreaming,</p> 
<p>I tried so hard to read this riddle through,</p> 
<p>To catch some golden cord that I saw gleaming</p> 
<p>Like gossamer against the autumn blue.</p> 
<p>But while I ponder’d these things, from the wood</p> 
<p>There came a black-hair’d woman, tall and bold,</p> 
<p>Who strode straight up to where the tower stood,</p>  
<p>Rapunzel, Rapunzel,</p>  
<p>Ah Christ! it was no dream then, but there stood</p> 
<p>(She comes again) a maiden passing fair,</p> 
<p>Against the roof, with face turn’d to the wood,</p> 
<p>Bearing within her arms waves of her yellow hair.</p> 
<p>I read my riddle when I saw her stand,</p> 
<p>Poor love! her face quite pale against her hair,</p> 
<p>Praying to all the leagues of empty land</p> 
<p>To save her from the woe she suffer’d there.</p> 
<p>To think! they trod upon her golden hair</p> 
<p>In the witches’ sabbaths; it was a delight</p> 
<p>For these foul things, while she, with thin feet bare,</p> 
<p>Stood on the roof upon the winter night,</p> 
<p>To plait her dear hair into many plaits,</p> 
<p>And then, while God’s eye look’d upon the thing,</p> 
<p>In the very likenesses of Devil’s bats,</p> 
<p>Upon the ends of her long hair to swing.</p> 
<p>And now she stood above the parapet,</p> 
<p>And, spreading out her arms, let her hair flow,</p> 
<p>Beneath that veil her smooth white forehead set</p> 
<p>Upon the marble, more I do not know;</p> 
<p>Because before my eyes a film of gold</p> 
<p>Floated, as now it floats. O unknown love,</p> 
<p>Would that I could thy yellow stair behold,</p>  
<p>Is there any who will dare</p> 
<p>To climb up the yellow stair,</p>  
<p>If it would please God make you sing again,</p> 
<p>I think that I might very sweetly die,</p> 
<p>My soul somehow reach heaven in joyous pain,</p> 
<p>My heavy body on the beech-nuts lie.</p> 
<p>Now I remember what a most strange year,</p> 
<p>Most strange and awful, in the beechen wood</p> 
<p>I have pass’d now; I still have a faint fear</p> 
<p>It is a kind of dream not understood.</p> 
<p>I have seen no one in this wood except</p> 
<p>The witch and her; have heard no human tones,</p> 
<p>But when the witches’ revelry has crept</p> 
<p>Between the very jointing of my bones.</p> 
<p>Ah! I know now; I could not go away,</p> 
<p>But needs must stop to hear her sing that song</p> 
<p>She always sings at dawning of the day.</p> 
<p>I am not happy here, for I am strong,</p> 
<p>And every morning do I whet my sword,</p> 
<p>Yet Rapunzel still weeps within the tower,</p> 
<p>And still God ties me down to the green sward,</p>  
<p>My mother taught me prayers</p> 
<p>To say when I had need;</p> 
<p>I have so many cares,</p> 
<p>That I can take no heed</p> 
<p>Of many words in them;</p> 
<p>But I remember this:</p> 
<p>Christ, bring me to thy bliss.</p> 
<p>Mary, maid withouten wem,</p> 
<p>Keep me! I am lone, I wis,</p> 
<p>Yet besides I have made this</p> 
<p>By myself: Give me a kiss,</p> 
<p>Dear God dwelling up in heaven!</p> 
<p>Also: Send me a true knight,</p> 
<p>Lord Christ, with a steel sword, bright,</p> 
<p>Broad, and trenchant; yea, and seven</p> 
<p>Spans from hilt to point, O Lord!</p> 
<p>And let the handle of his sword</p> 
<p>Be gold on silver, Lord in heaven!</p> 
<p>Such a sword as I see gleam</p> 
<p>Sometimes, when they let me dream.</p> 
<p>Yea, besides, I have made this:</p> 
<p>Lord, give Mary a dear kiss,</p> 
<p>And let gold Michael, who looked down,</p> 
<p>When I was there, on Rouen town</p> 
<p>From the spire, bring me that kiss</p> 
<p>On a lily! Lord do this!</p> 
<p>These prayers on the dreadful nights,</p> 
<p>When the witches plait my hair,</p> 
<p>And the fearfullest of sights</p> 
<p>On the earth and in the air,</p> 
<p>Will not let me close my eyes,</p> 
<p>I murmur often, mix’d with sighs,</p> 
<p>That my weak heart will not hold</p> 
<p>At some things that I behold.</p> 
<p>Nay, not sighs, but quiet groans,</p> 
<p>That swell out the little bones</p> 
<p>Of my bosom; till a trance</p> 
<p>God sends in middle of that dance,</p> 
<p>And I behold the countenance</p> 
<p>Of Michael, and can feel no more</p> 
<p>The bitter east wind biting sore</p> 
<p>My naked feet; can see no more</p> 
<p>The crayfish on the leaden floor,</p> 
<p>That mock with feeler and grim claw.</p> 
<p>Yea, often in that happy trance,</p> 
<p>Beside the blessed countenance</p> 
<p>Of golden Michael, on the spire</p> 
<p>Glowing all crimson in the fire</p> 
<p>Of sunset, I behold a face,</p> 
<p>Which sometime, if God give me grace,</p> 
<p>May kiss me in this very place.</p>  
<p>It grows half way between the dark and light;</p> 
<p>Love, we have been six hours here alone:</p> 
<p>I fear that she will come before the night,</p>  
<p>Nay, draw a little nearer, that your breath</p> 
<p>May touch my lips, let my cheek feel your arm;</p> 
<p>Now tell me, did you ever see a death,</p>  
<p>Once came two knights and fought with swords below,</p> 
<p>And while they fought I scarce could look at all,</p> 
<p>My head swam so; after, a moaning low</p> 
<p>Drew my eyes down; I saw against the wall</p> 
<p>One knight lean dead, bleeding from head and breast,</p> 
<p>Yet seem’d it like a line of poppies red</p> 
<p>In the golden twilight, as he took his rest,</p> 
<p>In the dusky time he scarcely seemed dead.</p> 
<p>But the other, on his face, six paces off,</p> 
<p>Lay moaning, and the old familiar name</p> 
<p>He mutter’d through the grass, seem’d like a scoff</p> 
<p>Of some lost soul remembering his past fame.</p> 
<p>His helm all dinted lay beside him there,</p> 
<p>The visor-bars were twisted towards the face,</p> 
<p>The crest, which was a lady very fair,</p> 
<p>Wrought wonderfully, was shifted from its place.</p> 
<p>The shower’d mail-rings on the speedwell lay,</p> 
<p>Perhaps my eyes were dazzled with the light</p> 
<p>That blazed in the west, yet surely on that day</p> 
<p>Some crimson thing had changed the grass from bright</p> 
<p>Pure green I love so. But the knight who died</p> 
<p>Lay there for days after the other went;</p> 
<p>Until one day I heard a voice that cried:</p> 
<p>Fair knight, I see Sir Robert we were sent</p> 
<p>To carry dead or living to the king.</p> 
<p>So the knights came and bore him straight away</p> 
<p>On their lance truncheons, such a batter’d thing,</p> 
<p>His mother had not known him on that day,</p> 
<p>But for his helm-crest, a gold lady fair</p>  
<p>Ah, they were brothers then,</p> 
<p>And often rode together, doubtless where</p> 
<p>The swords were thickest, and were loyal men,</p>  
<p>Yea, love; but shall we not depart from hence?</p> 
<p>The white moon groweth golden fast, and gleams</p> 
<p>Between the aspens stems; I fear, and yet a sense</p> 
<p>Of fluttering victory comes over me,</p> 
<p>That will not let me fear aright; my heart,</p> 
<p>Feel how it beats, love, strives to get to thee;</p> 
<p>I breathe so fast that my lips needs must part;</p>  
<p>I, Sebald, also, pluck from off the staff</p> 
<p>The crimson banner; let it lie below,</p> 
<p>Above it in the wind let grasses laugh.</p> 
<p>Now let us go, love, down the winding stair,</p> 
<p>With fingers intertwined: ay, feel my sword!</p> 
<p>I wrought it long ago, with golden hair</p> 
<p>Flowing about the hilts, because a word,</p> 
<p>Sung by a minstrel old, had set me dreaming</p> 
<p>Of a sweet bow’d down face with yellow hair;</p> 
<p>Betwixt green leaves I used to see it gleaming,</p> 
<p>A half smile on the lips, though lines of care</p> 
<p>Had sunk the cheeks, and made the great eyes hollow;</p> 
<p>What other work in all the world had I,</p> 
<p>But through all turns of fate that face to follow?</p> 
<p>But wars and business kept me there to die.</p> 
<p>O child, I should have slain my brother, too,</p> 
<p>My brother, Love, lain moaning in the grass,</p> 
<p>Had I not ridden out to look for you,</p> 
<p>When I had watch’d the gilded courtiers pass</p> 
<p>From the golden hall. But it is strange your name</p> 
<p>Is not the same the minstrel sung of yore;</p> 
<p>You call’d it Rapunzel, ’tis not the name.</p> 
<p>See, love, the stems shine through the open door.</p>  
<p>O love! me and my unknown name you have well won;</p> 
<p>The witch’s name was Rapunzel: eh! not so sweet?</p> 
<p>No! but is this real grass, love, that I tread upon?</p>  
<p>Dip down your dear face in the dewy grass, O love!</p> 
<p>And ever let the sweet slim harebells, tenderly hung,</p> 
<p>Kiss both your parted lips; and I will hang above,</p> 
<p>And try to sing that song the dreamy harper sung.</p> 
<p>He sings.</p> 
<p>‘Twixt the sunlight and the shade</p> 
<p>Float up memories of my maid:</p> 
<p>God, remember Guendolen!</p> 
<p>Gold or gems she did not wear,</p> 
<p>But her yellow rippled hair,</p> 
<p>Like a veil, hid Guendolen!</p> 
<p>‘Twixt the sunlight and the shade,</p> 
<p>My rough hands so strangely made,</p> 
<p>Folded Golden Guendolen.</p> 
<p>Hands used to grip the sword-hilt hard,</p> 
<p>Framed her face, while on the sward</p> 
<p>Tears fell down from Guendolen.</p> 
<p>Guendolen now speaks no word,</p> 
<p>Hands fold round about the sword:</p> 
<p>Now no more of Guendolen.</p> 
<p>Only ‘twixt the light and shade</p> 
<p>Floating memories of my maid</p>  
<p>I kiss thee, new-found name! but I will never go:</p> 
<p>Your hands need never grip the hammer’d sword again,</p> 
<p>But all my golden hair shall ever round you flow,</p> 
<p>Between the light and shade from Golden Guendolen.</p>  
<p>I took my armour off,</p> 
<p>Put on king’s robes of gold;</p> 
<p>Over the kirtle green</p>  
<p>Guendolen! Guendolen!</p>  
<p>I am so glad, for every day</p> 
<p>He kisses me much the same way</p> 
<p>As in the tower: under the sway</p>  
<p>We rode throughout the town,</p> 
<p>A gold crown on my head;</p> 
<p>Through all the gold-hung streets,</p>  
<p>Gwendolen! Guendolen!</p>  
<p>Verily, I seem like one</p> 
<p>Who, when day is almost done,</p> 
<p>Through a thick wood meets the sun</p>  
<p>Yea, at the palace gates,</p> 
<p>Praise God! the great knights said,</p> 
<p>For Sebald the high king,</p>  
<p>Woe is me! Guendolen</p>  
<p>Nothing wretched now, no screams;</p> 
<p>I was unhappy once in dreams,</p> 
<p>And even now a harsh voice seems</p>  
<p>WOE! THAT ANY MAN COULD DARE</p> 
<p>TO CLIMB UP THE YELLOW STAIR,</p> 
<p>GLORIOUS GUENDOLEN’S GOLDEN HAIR.</p>
