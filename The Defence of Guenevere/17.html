<p>Ah! no, no, it is nothing, surely nothing at all,</p> 
<p>Only the wild-going wind round by the garden-wall,</p> 
<p>For the dawn just now is breaking, the wind beginning to fall.</p> 
<p>Wind, wind! thou art sad, art thou kind?</p> 
<p>Wind, wind, unhappy! thou art blind,</p> 
<p>Yet still thou wanderest the lily-seed to find.</p> 
<p>So I will sit, and think and think of the days gone by,</p> 
<p>Never moving my chair for fear the dogs should cry,</p> 
<p>Making no noise at all while the flambeau burns awry.</p> 
<p>For my chair is heavy and carved, and with sweeping green behind</p> 
<p>It is hung, and the dragons thereon grin out in the gusts of the wind;</p> 
<p>On its folds an orange lies, with a deep gash cut in the rind.</p> 
<p>Wind, wind! thou art sad, art thou kind?</p> 
<p>Wind, wind, unhappy! thou art blind,</p> 
<p>still thou wanderest the lily-seed to find.</p> 
<p>If I move my chair it will scream, and the orange will roll out afar,</p> 
<p>And the faint yellow juice ooze out like blood from a wizard’s jar;</p> 
<p>And the dogs will howl for those who went last month to the war.</p> 
<p>Wind, wind! thou art sad, art thou kind?</p> 
<p>Wind, wind, unhappy! thou art blind,</p> 
<p>Yet still thou wanderest the lily-seed to find.</p> 
<p>So I will sit and think of love that is over and past,</p> 
<p>O, so long ago! Yes, I will be quiet at last:</p> 
<p>Whether I like it or not, a grim half-slumber is cast</p> 
<p>Over my worn old brains, that touches the roots of my heart,</p> 
<p>And above my half-shut eyes, the blue roof ‘gins to part,</p> 
<p>And show the blue spring sky, till I am ready to start</p> 
<p>From out of the green-hung chair; but something keeps me still,</p> 
<p>And I fall in a dream that I walk’d with her on the side of a hill,</p> 
<p>Dotted, for was it not spring? with tufts of the daffodil.</p> 
<p>Wind, wind! thou art sad, art thou kind?</p> 
<p>Wind, wind, unhappy! thou art blind,</p> 
<p>Yet still thou wanderest the lily-seed to find.</p> 
<p>And Margaret as she walk’d held a painted book in her hand;</p> 
<p>Her finger kept the place; I caught her, we both did stand</p> 
<p>Face to face, on the top of the highest hill in the land.</p> 
<p>Wind, wind! thou art sad, art thou kind?</p> 
<p>Wind, wind, unhappy! thou art blind,</p> 
<p>Yet still thou wanderest the lily-seed to find.</p> 
<p>I held to her long bare arms, but she shudder’d away from me,</p> 
<p>While the flush went out of her face as her head fell back on a tree,</p> 
<p>And a spasm caught her mouth, fearful for me to see;</p> 
<p>And still I held to her arms till her shoulder touched my mail,</p> 
<p>Weeping she totter’d forward, so glad that I should prevail,</p> 
<p>And her hair went over my robe, like a gold flag over a sail.</p> 
<p>Wind, wind! thou art sad, art thou kind?</p> 
<p>Wind, wind, unhappy! thou art blind,</p> 
<p>Yet still thou wanderest the lily-seed to find.</p> 
<p>I kiss’d her hard by the ear, and she kiss’d me on the brow,</p> 
<p>And then lay down on the grass, where the mark on the moss is now,</p> 
<p>And spread her arms out wide while I went down below.</p> 
<p>Wind, wind! thou art sad, art thou kind?</p> 
<p>Wind, wind, unhappy! thou art blind,</p> 
<p>Yet still thou wanderest the lily-seed to find.</p> 
<p>And then I walk’d for a space to and fro on the side of the hill,</p> 
<p>Till I gather’d and held in my arms great sheaves of the daffodil,</p> 
<p>And when I came again my Margaret lay there still.</p> 
<p>I piled them high and high above her heaving breast,</p> 
<p>How they were caught and held in her loose ungirded vest!</p> 
<p>But one beneath her arm died, happy so to be prest!</p> 
<p>Wind, wind! thou art sad, art thou kind?</p> 
<p>Wind, wind, unhappy! thou art blind,</p> 
<p>Yet still thou wanderest the lily-seed to find.</p> 
<p>Again I turn’d my back and went away for an hour;</p> 
<p>She said no word when I came again, so, flower by flower,</p> 
<p>I counted the daffodils over, and cast them languidly lower.</p> 
<p>Wind, wind! thou art sad, art thou kind?</p> 
<p>Wind, wind, unhappy! thou art blind,</p> 
<p>Yet still thou wanderest the lily-seed to find.</p> 
<p>My dry hands shook and shook as the green gown show’d again,</p> 
<p>Clear’d from the yellow flowers, and I grew hollow with pain,</p> 
<p>And on to us both there fell from the sun-shower drops of rain.</p> 
<p>Wind, wind! thou art sad, art thou kind?</p> 
<p>Wind, wind, unhappy! thou art blind,</p> 
<p>Yet still thou wanderest the lily-seed to find.</p> 
<p>Alas! alas! there was blood on the very quiet breast,</p> 
<p>Blood lay in the many folds of the loose ungirded vest,</p> 
<p>Blood lay upon her arm where the flower had been prest.</p> 
<p>I shriek’d and leapt from my chair, and the orange roll’d out afar,</p> 
<p>The faint yellow juice oozed out like blood from a wizard’s jar;</p> 
<p>And then in march’d the ghosts of those that had gone to the war.</p> 
<p>I knew them by the arms that I was used to paint</p> 
<p>Upon their long thin shields; but the colours were all grown faint,</p> 
<p>And faint upon their banner was Olaf, king and saint.</p> 
<p>Wind, wind! thou art sad, art thou kind?</p> 
<p>Wind, wind, unhappy! thou art blind,</p> 
<p>Yet still thou wanderest the lily-seed to find.</p>
