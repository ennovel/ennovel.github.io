<p>We took down at St. John’s hard by the mill,</p> 
<p>Two are good masons; we have tools enough,</p>  
<p>So:</p>  
<p>Why, Jacques Aquadent,</p>  
<p>What colour’d hair</p>  
<p>Why, sir, you jest: what matters Jacques’ hair,</p>  
<p>O! John, John, John!</p> 
<p>Throw all your mason’s tools down the deep well,</p> 
<p>Hang Peter up and Jacques; They’re no good,</p>  
<p>Shall I call the guard</p> 
<p>To hang them, sir? and yet, sir, for the tools,</p> 
<p>We’d better keep them still; sir, fare you well.</p> 
<p>[Muttering as he goes.</p> 
<p>What have I done that he should jape at me?</p> 
<p>And why not build? the walls are weak enough,</p> 
<p>And we’ve two masons and a heap of tools.</p>  
<p>To think a man should have a lump like that</p> 
<p>For his lieutenant! I must call him back,</p> 
<p>Or else, as surely as St. George is dead,</p>   
<p>Come now, and talk</p> 
<p>This weighty matter out; there, we’ve no stone</p>   
<p>We are not strong enough to send ten men</p> 
<p>Ten miles to fetch us stone enough to build.</p> 
<p>In three hours’ time they would be taken or slain,</p>   
<p>Alas! John, that we cannot bring them back,</p> 
<p>They would go off to Clisson or Sanxere,</p> 
<p>And tell them we were weak in walls and men,</p> 
<p>Then down go we; for, look you, times are changed,</p> 
<p>And now no longer does the country shake</p> 
<p>At sound of English names; our captains fade</p> 
<p>From off our muster-rolls. At Lusac bridge</p> 
<p>I daresay you may even yet see the hole</p> 
<p>That Chandos beat in dying; far in Spain</p> 
<p>Pembroke is prisoner; Phelton prisoner here;</p> 
<p>Manny lies buried in the Charterhouse;</p> 
<p>Oliver Clisson turn’d these years agone;</p> 
<p>The Captal died in prison; and, over all,</p> 
<p>Edward the prince lies underneath the ground,</p> 
<p>Edward the king is dead, at Westminster</p> 
<p>The carvers smooth the curls of his long beard.</p> 
<p>Everything goes to rack — eh! and we too.</p> 
<p>Now, Curzon, listen; if they come, these French,</p> 
<p>Whom have I got to lean on here, but you?</p> 
<p>A man can die but once, will you die then,</p> 
<p>Your brave sword in your hand, thoughts in your heart</p> 
<p>Of all the deeds we have done here in France —</p> 
<p>And yet may do? So God will have your soul,</p>  
<p>Why, sir, I</p> 
<p>Will fight till the last moment, until then</p> 
<p>Will do whate’er you tell me. Now I see</p> 
<p>We must e’en leave the walls; well, well, perhaps</p> 
<p>They’re stronger than I think for; pity, though!</p>  
<p>Farewell, John, pray you watch the Gascons well,</p>   
<p>Farewell, good lump! and yet, when all is said,</p> 
<p>’Tis a good lump. Why then, if Guesclin comes;</p> 
<p>Some dozen stones from his petrariae,</p> 
<p>And, under shelter of his crossbows, just</p> 
<p>An hour’s steady work with pickaxes,</p> 
<p>Then a great noise — some dozen swords and glaives</p> 
<p>A-playing on my basnet all at once,</p> 
<p>And little more cross purposes on earth</p> 
<p>For me.</p> 
<p>Now this is hard: a month ago,</p> 
<p>And a few minutes’ talk had set things right</p> 
<p>‘Twixt me and Alice; if she had a doubt,</p> 
<p>As, may Heaven bless her! I scarce think she had,</p> 
<p>’Twas but their hammer, hammer in her ears,</p> 
<p>Of how Sir Peter fail’d at Lusac Bridge:</p> 
<p>And how he was grown moody of late days;</p> 
<p>And how Sir Lambert, think now! his dear friend,</p> 
<p>His sweet, dear cousin, could not but confess</p> 
<p>That Peter’s talk tended towards the French,</p> 
<p>Which he, for instance Lambert, was glad of,</p> 
<p>Being, Lambert, you see, on the French side.</p> 
<p>Well,</p> 
<p>If I could but have seen her on that day,</p> 
<p>Then, when they sent me off!</p> 
<p>I like to think,</p> 
<p>Although it hurts me, makes my head twist, what,</p> 
<p>If I had seen her, what I should have said,</p> 
<p>What she, my darling, would have said and done.</p> 
<p>As thus perchance.</p> 
<p>To find her sitting there,</p> 
<p>In the window-seat, not looking well at all,</p> 
<p>Crying perhaps, and I say quietly:</p> 
<p>Alice! she looks up, chokes a sob, looks grave,</p> 
<p>Changes from pale to red, but, ere she speaks,</p> 
<p>Straightway I kneel down there on both my knees,</p> 
<p>And say: O lady, have I sinn’d, your knight?</p> 
<p>That still you ever let me walk alone</p> 
<p>In the rose garden, that you sing no songs</p> 
<p>When I am by, that ever in the dance</p> 
<p>You quietly walk away when I come near?</p> 
<p>Now that I have you, will you go, think you?</p> 
<p>Ere she could answer I would speak again,</p> 
<p>Still kneeling there.</p> 
<p>What! they have frighted you,</p> 
<p>By hanging burs, and clumsily carven puppets,</p> 
<p>Round my good name; but afterwards, my love,</p> 
<p>I will say what this means; this moment, see!</p> 
<p>Do I kneel here, and can you doubt me? Yea:</p> 
<p>For she would put her hands upon my face:</p> 
<p>Yea, that is best, yea feel, love, am I changed?</p> 
<p>And she would say: Good knight, come, kiss my lips!</p> 
<p>And afterwards as I sat there would say:</p> 
<p>Please a poor silly girl by telling me</p> 
<p>What all those things they talk of really were,</p> 
<p>For it is true you did not help Chandos,</p> 
<p>And true, poor love! you could not come to me</p> 
<p>When I was in such peril.</p> 
<p>I should say:</p> 
<p>I am like Balen, all things turn to blame.</p> 
<p>I did not come to you? At Bergerath</p> 
<p>The constable had held us close shut up,</p> 
<p>If from the barriers I had made three steps,</p> 
<p>I should have been but slain; at Lusac, too,</p> 
<p>We struggled in a marish half the day,</p> 
<p>And came too late at last: you know, my love,</p> 
<p>How heavy men and horses are all arm’d.</p> 
<p>All that Sir Lambert said was pure, unmix’d,</p> 
<p>Quite groundless lies; as you can think, sweet love.</p> 
<p>She, holding tight my hand as we sat there,</p> 
<p>Started a little at Sir Lambert’s name,</p> 
<p>But otherwise she listen’d scarce at all</p> 
<p>To what I said. Then with moist, weeping eyes,</p> 
<p>And quivering lips, that scarcely let her speak,</p> 
<p>She said: I love you.</p> 
<p>Other words were few,</p> 
<p>The remnant of that hour; her hand smooth’d down</p> 
<p>My foolish head; she kiss’d me all about</p> 
<p>My face, and through the tangles of my beard</p> 
<p>Her little fingers crept!</p> 
<p>O God, my Alice,</p> 
<p>Not this good way: my lord but sent and said</p> 
<p>That Lambert’s sayings were taken at their worth,</p> 
<p>Therefore that day I was to start, and keep</p> 
<p>This hold against the French; and I am here:</p> 
<p>[Looks out of the window.</p> 
<p>A sprawling lonely garde with rotten walls,</p> 
<p>And no one to bring aid if Guesclin comes,</p> 
<p>Or any other.</p> 
<p>There’s a pennon now!</p> 
<p>At last.</p> 
<p>But not the constable’s: whose arms,</p> 
<p>I wonder, does it bear? Three golden rings</p> 
<p>On a red ground; my cousin’s by the rood!</p> 
<p>Well, I should like to kill him, certainly,</p> 
<p>But to be kill’d by him: [A trumpet sounds.</p> 
<p>That’s for a herald;</p> 
<p>I doubt this does not mean assaulting yet.</p> 
<p>Enter John Curzon.</p>  
<p>So please you, sir, concerning your estate,</p>  
<p>Outside,</p> 
<p>I’ll talk with him, close by the gate St. Ives.</p>   
<p>Then bid them bring me hither my furr’d gown</p> 
<p>With the long sleeves, and under it I’ll wear,</p> 
<p>By Lambert’s leave, a secret coat of mail;</p> 
<p>And will you lend me, John, your little axe?</p> 
<p>I mean the one with Paul wrought on the blade?</p> 
<p>And I will carry it inside my sleeve,</p> 
<p>Good to be ready always; you, John, go</p> 
<p>And bid them set up many suits of arms,</p> 
<p>Bows, archgays, lances, in the base-court, and</p> 
<p>Yourself, from the south postern setting out,</p> 
<p>With twenty men, be ready to break through</p>  
<p>How, sir! will you attack him unawares,</p>  
<p>Trust me, John, I know</p> 
<p>The reason why he comes here with sleeved gown,</p> 
<p>Fit to hide axes up. So, let us go. [They go.</p>  
<p>And if I choose to take the losing side</p>  
<p>O! no hurt to me;</p> 
<p>I see you sneering, Why take trouble then,</p> 
<p>Seeing you love me not? Look you, our house</p> 
<p>(Which, taken altogether, I love much)</p> 
<p>Had better be upon the right side now,</p> 
<p>If, once for all, it wishes to bear rule</p> 
<p>As such a house should: cousin, you’re too wise</p> 
<p>To feed your hope up fat, that this fair France</p> 
<p>Will ever draw two ways again; this side</p> 
<p>The French, wrong-headed, all a-jar</p> 
<p>With envious longings; and the other side</p> 
<p>The order’d English, orderly led on</p> 
<p>By those two Edwards through all wrong and right,</p> 
<p>And muddling right and wrong to a thick broth</p> 
<p>With that long stick, their strength. This is all changed,</p> 
<p>The true French win, on either side you have</p> 
<p>Cool-headed men, good at a tilting match,</p> 
<p>And good at setting battles in array,</p> 
<p>And good at squeezing taxes at due time;</p> 
<p>Therefore by nature we French being here</p> 
<p>Upon our own big land: [Sir Peter laughs aloud.</p> 
<p>Well, Peter! well!</p>  
<p>Hearing you sweat to prove</p> 
<p>All this I know so well; but you have read</p>   
<p>There! they were wrong, as wrong as men could be</p> 
<p>For, as I think, they found it such delight</p> 
<p>To see fair Helen going through their town;</p> 
<p>Yea, any little common thing she did</p> 
<p>(As stooping to pick a flower) seem’d so strange,</p> 
<p>So new in its great beauty, that they said:</p> 
<p>Here we will keep her living in this town,</p> 
<p>Till all burns up together. And so, fought,</p> 
<p>In a mad whirl of knowing they were wrong;</p> 
<p>Yea, they fought well, and ever, like a man</p> 
<p>That hangs legs off the ground by both his hands,</p> 
<p>Over some great height, did they struggle sore,</p> 
<p>Quite sure to slip at last; wherefore, take note</p> 
<p>How almost all men, reading that sad siege,</p> 
<p>Hold for the Trojans; as I did at least,</p> 
<p>Thought Hector the best knight a long way:</p> 
<p>Now</p> 
<p>Why should I not do this thing that I think;</p> 
<p>For even when I come to count the gains,</p> 
<p>I have them my side: men will talk, you know</p> 
<p>(We talk of Hector, dead so long agone,)</p> 
<p>When I am dead, of how this Peter clung</p> 
<p>To what he thought the right; of how he died,</p> 
<p>Perchance, at last, doing some desperate deed</p> 
<p>Few men would care do now, and this is gain</p> 
<p>To me, as ease and money is to you.</p> 
<p>Moreover, too, I like the straining game</p> 
<p>Of striving well to hold up things that fall;</p> 
<p>So one becomes great. See you! in good times</p> 
<p>All men live well together, and you, too,</p> 
<p>Live dull and happy: happy? not so quick,</p> 
<p>Suppose sharp thoughts begin to burn you up?</p> 
<p>Why then, but just to fight as I do now,</p> 
<p>A halter round my neck, would be great bliss.</p> 
<p>O! I am well off. [Aside.</p> 
<p>Talk, and talk, and talk,</p> 
<p>I know this man has come to murder me,</p>  
<p>If your side were right,</p> 
<p>You might be, though you lost; but if I said,</p> 
<p>‘You are a traitor, being, as you are,</p> 
<p>Born Frenchman.’ What are Edwards unto you,</p>  
<p>Nay, hold there, my Lambert, hold!</p> 
<p>For fear your zeal should bring you to some harm,</p>  
<p>Furthermore, my knight,</p> 
<p>Men call you slippery on your losing side,</p> 
<p>When at Bordeaux I was ambassador,</p> 
<p>I heard them say so, and could scarce say: Nay.</p>  
<p>They lied: and you lie, not for the first time.</p> 
<p>What have you got there, fumbling up your sleeve,</p>  
<p>Nay, liar in your teeth!</p> 
<p>Dead liar too; St. Denis and St. Lambert!</p>  
<p>How thief! thief! thief! so there, fair thief, so there,</p> 
<p>St. George Guienne! glaives for the castellan!</p> 
<p>You French, you are but dead, unless you lay</p> 
<p>Your spears upon the earth. St. George Guienne!</p> 
<p>Well done, John Curzon, how he has them now.</p>   
<p>Why, put them all to ransom, those that can</p> 
<p>Pay anything, but not too light though, John,</p> 
<p>Seeing we have them on the hip: for those</p> 
<p>That have no money, that being certified,</p> 
<p>Why, turn them out of doors before they spy;</p>   
<p>I do not wish to kill him,</p> 
<p>Although I think I ought; he shall go mark’d,</p> 
<p>By all the saints, though!</p> 
<p>Enter Lambert guarded.</p> 
<p>Now, Sir Lambert, now!</p> 
<p>What sort of death do you expect to get,</p>  
<p>Cousin! cousin! think!</p> 
<p>I am your own blood; may God pardon me!</p> 
<p>I am not fit to die; if you knew all,</p> 
<p>All I have done since I was young and good.</p> 
<p>O! you would give me yet another chance,</p> 
<p>As God would, that I might wash all clear out,</p> 
<p>By serving you and Him. Let me go now!</p> 
<p>And I will pay you down more golden crowns</p>  
<p>Well, stand back,</p> 
<p>And do not touch me! No, you shall not die,</p> 
<p>Nor yet pay ransom. You, John Curzon, cause</p> 
<p>Some carpenters to build a scaffold, high,</p> 
<p>Outside the gate; when it is built, sound out</p> 
<p>To all good folks, ‘Come, see a traitor punish’d!’</p> 
<p>Take me my knight, and set him up thereon,</p> 
<p>And let the hangman shave his head quite clean,</p> 
<p>And cut his ears off close up to the head;</p> 
<p>And cause the minstrels all the while to play</p> 
<p>Soft music, and good singing; for this day</p> 
<p>Is my high day of triumph; is it not,</p>  
<p>Ah! on your own blood,</p> 
<p>Own name, you heap this foul disgrace? you dare,</p> 
<p>With hands and fame thus sullied, to go back</p>  
<p>Say her name</p> 
<p>Again, and you are dead, slain here by me.</p> 
<p>Why should I talk with you? I’m master here,</p> 
<p>And do not want your schooling; is it not</p> 
<p>My mercy that you are not dangling dead</p>  
<p>Such mercy! why not kill me then outright?</p> 
<p>To die is nothing; but to live that all</p>  
<p>Why, will it make you any uglier man</p> 
<p>To lose your ears? they’re much too big for you,</p>  
<p>Hold, John! [To Lambert.</p> 
<p>That’s your choice,</p> 
<p>To die, mind! Then you shall die: Lambert mine,</p> 
<p>I thank you now for choosing this so well,</p> 
<p>It saves me much perplexity and doubt;</p> 
<p>Perchance an ill deed too, for half I count</p> 
<p>This sparing traitors is an ill deed.</p> 
<p>Well,</p>  
<p>O God! this is a fiend and not a man;</p> 
<p>Will some one save me from him? help, help, help!</p>  
<p>Why, what is this I see?</p> 
<p>A man who is a knight, and bandied words</p> 
<p>So well just now with me, is lying down,</p> 
<p>Gone mad for fear like this! So, so, you thought</p> 
<p>You knew the worst, and might say what you pleased.</p> 
<p>I should have guess’d this from a man like you.</p> 
<p>Eh! righteous Job would give up skin for skin,</p> 
<p>Yea, all a man can have for simple life,</p> 
<p>And we talk fine, yea, even a hound like this,</p> 
<p>Who needs must know that when he dies, deep hell</p> 
<p>Will hold him fast for ever, so fine we talk,</p> 
<p>‘Would rather die,’ all that. Now sir, get up!</p> 
<p>And choose again: shall it be head sans ears,</p> 
<p>Or trunk sans head?</p> 
<p>John Curzon, pull him up!</p> 
<p>What, life then? go and build the scaffold, John.</p> 
<p>Lambert, I hope that never on this earth</p> 
<p>We meet again; that you’ll turn out a monk,</p> 
<p>And mend the life I give you, so farewell,</p> 
<p>I’m sorry you’re a rascal. John, despatch.</p> 
<p>In the French camp before the Castle.</p>  
<p>So now is come the ending of my life;</p> 
<p>If I could clear this sickening lump away</p> 
<p>That sticks in my dry throat, and say a word,</p>  
<p>Tell me, fair sir knight,</p> 
<p>If you have been clean liver before God,</p> 
<p>And then you need not fear much; as for me,</p> 
<p>I cannot say I hate you, yet my oath,</p>  
<p>I knew you could not hate me, therefore I</p> 
<p>Am bold to pray for life; ’twill harm your cause</p> 
<p>To hang knights of good name, harms here in France</p> 
<p>I have small doubt, at any rate hereafter</p> 
<p>Men will remember you another way</p> 
<p>Than I should care to be remember’d, ah!</p> 
<p>Although hot lead runs through me for my blood,</p> 
<p>All this falls cold as though I said, Sweet lords,</p> 
<p>Give back my falcon!</p> 
<p>See how young I am,</p> 
<p>Do you care altogether more for France,</p> 
<p>Say rather one French faction, than for all</p> 
<p>The state of Christendom? a gallant knight,</p> 
<p>As (yea, by God!) I have been, is more worth</p> 
<p>Than many castles; will you bring this death,</p> 
<p>For a mere act of justice, on my head?</p> 
<p>Think how it ends all, death! all other things</p> 
<p>Can somehow be retrieved, yea, send me forth</p> 
<p>Naked and maimed, rather than slay me here;</p> 
<p>Then somehow will I get me other clothes,</p> 
<p>And somehow will I get me some poor horse,</p> 
<p>And, somehow clad in poor old rusty arms,</p> 
<p>Will ride and smite among the serried glaives,</p> 
<p>Fear not death so; for I can tilt right well,</p> 
<p>Let me not say I could; I know all tricks,</p> 
<p>That sway the sharp sword cunningly; ah you,</p> 
<p>You, my Lord Clisson, in the other days</p> 
<p>Have seen me learning these, yea, call to mind,</p> 
<p>How in the trodden corn by Chartres town,</p> 
<p>When you were nearly swooning from the back</p> 
<p>Of your black horse, those three blades slid at once</p>  
<p>Nay, this is pitiful, to see him die.</p> 
<p>My Lord the Constable, I pray you note</p> 
<p>That you are losing some few thousand crowns</p> 
<p>By slaying this man; also think: his lands</p> 
<p>Along the Garonne river lie for leagues,</p> 
<p>And are right rich, a many mills he has,</p> 
<p>Three abbeys of grey monks do hold of him:</p> 
<p>Though wishing well for Clement, as we do,</p> 
<p>I know the next heir, his old uncle, well,</p> 
<p>Who does not care two deniers for the knight</p> 
<p>As things go now, but slay him, and then see,</p> 
<p>How he will bristle up like any perch,</p> 
<p>With curves of spears. What! do not doubt, my lord,</p> 
<p>You’ll get the money, this man saved my life,</p> 
<p>And I will buy him for two thousand crowns;</p> 
<p>Well, five then: eh! what! No again? well then,</p>  
<p>My sweet lord, much I grieve</p> 
<p>I cannot please you, yea, good sooth, I grieve</p> 
<p>This knight must die, as verily he must;</p> 
<p>For I have sworn it, so men take him out,</p>  
<p>Music, do you know,</p> 
<p>Music will suit you well, I think, because</p> 
<p>You look so mild, like Laurence being grill’d;</p> 
<p>Or perhaps music soft and slow, because</p> 
<p>This is high day of triumph unto me,</p> 
<p>Is it not, Peter?</p> 
<p>You are frighten’d, though,</p> 
<p>Eh! you are pale, because this hurts you much,</p> 
<p>Whose life was pleasant to you, not like mine,</p> 
<p>You ruin’d wretch! Men mock me in the streets,</p> 
<p>Only in whispers loud, because I am</p> 
<p>Friend of the constable; will this please you,</p> 
<p>Unhappy Peter? once a-going home,</p> 
<p>Without my servants, and a little drunk,</p> 
<p>At midnight through the lone dim lamp-lit streets.</p> 
<p>A whore came up and spat into my eyes,</p> 
<p>Rather to blind me than to make me see,</p> 
<p>But she was very drunk, and tottering back,</p> 
<p>Even in the middle of her laughter fell</p> 
<p>And cut her head against the pointed stones,</p> 
<p>While I lean’d on my staff, and look’d at her,</p> 
<p>And cried, being drunk.</p> 
<p>Girls would not spit at you.</p> 
<p>You are so handsome, I think verily</p> 
<p>Most ladies would be glad to kiss your eyes,</p> 
<p>And yet you will be hung like a cur dog</p> 
<p>Five minutes hence, and grow black in the face,</p> 
<p>And curl your toes up. Therefore I am glad.</p> 
<p>Guess why I stand and talk this nonsense now,</p> 
<p>With Guesclin getting ready to play chess,</p> 
<p>And Clisson doing something with his sword,</p> 
<p>I can’t see what, talking to Guesclin though,</p> 
<p>I don’t know what about, perhaps of you.</p> 
<p>But, cousin Peter, while I stroke your beard,</p> 
<p>Let me say this, I’d like to tell you now</p> 
<p>That your life hung upon a game of chess,</p> 
<p>That if, say, my squire Robert here should beat,</p> 
<p>Why you should live, but hang if I beat him;</p> 
<p>Then guess, clever Peter, what I should do then:</p> 
<p>Well, give it up? why, Peter, I should let</p> 
<p>My squire Robert beat me, then you would think</p> 
<p>That you were safe, you know; Eh? not at all,</p> 
<p>But I should keep you three days in some hold,</p> 
<p>Giving you salt to eat, which would be kind,</p> 
<p>Considering the tax there is on salt;</p> 
<p>And afterwards should let you go, perhaps?</p> 
<p>No I should not, but I should hang you, sir,</p> 
<p>With a red rope in lieu of mere grey rope.</p> 
<p>But I forgot, you have not told me yet</p> 
<p>If you can guess why I talk nonsense thus,</p> 
<p>Instead of drinking wine while you are hang’d?</p> 
<p>You are not quick at guessing, give it up.</p> 
<p>This is the reason; here I hold your hand,</p> 
<p>And watch you growing paler, see you writhe</p> 
<p>And this, my Peter, is a joy so dear,</p> 
<p>I cannot by all striving tell you how</p> 
<p>I love it, nor I think, good man, would you</p> 
<p>Quite understand my great delight therein;</p> 
<p>You, when you had me underneath you once,</p> 
<p>Spat as it were, and said, ‘Go take him out,’</p> 
<p>That they might do that thing to me whereat,</p> 
<p>E’en now this long time off I could well shriek,</p> 
<p>And then you tried forget I ever lived,</p> 
<p>And sunk your hating into other things;</p> 
<p>While I: St. Denis! though, I think you’ll faint,</p> 
<p>Your lips are grey so; yes, you will, unless</p> 
<p>You let it out and weep like a hurt child;</p> 
<p>Hurrah! you do now. Do not go just yet,</p> 
<p>For I am Alice, am right like her now,</p>  
<p>You filthy beast, stand back and let him go,</p> 
<p>Or by God’s eyes I’ll choke you!</p> 
<p>[Kneeling to Sir Peter.</p> 
<p>Fair sir knight</p> 
<p>I kneel upon my knees and pray to you</p> 
<p>That you would pardon me for this your death;</p> 
<p>God knows how much I wish you still alive,</p> 
<p>Also how heartily I strove to save</p> 
<p>Your life at this time; yea, he knows quite well,</p> 
<p>(I swear it, so forgive me!) how I would,</p> 
<p>If it were possible, give up my life</p> 
<p>Upon this grass for yours; fair knight, although,</p> 
<p>He knowing all things knows this thing too, well,</p> 
<p>Yet when you see his face some short time hence,</p>  
<p>O! my lord,</p> 
<p>I cannot say this is as good as life,</p> 
<p>But yet it makes me feel far happier now,</p> 
<p>And if at all, after a thousand years,</p> 
<p>I see God’s face, I will speak loud and bold,</p> 
<p>And tell Him you were kind, and like Himself;</p> 
<p>Sir, may God bless you!</p> 
<p>Did you note how I</p> 
<p>Fell weeping just now? pray you, do not think</p> 
<p>That Lambert’s taunts did this, I hardly heard</p> 
<p>The base things that he said, being deep in thought</p> 
<p>Of all things that have happen’d since I was</p> 
<p>A little child; and so at last I thought</p> 
<p>Of my true lady: truly, sir, it seem’d</p> 
<p>No longer gone than yesterday, that this</p> 
<p>Was the sole reason God let me be born</p> 
<p>Twenty-five years ago, that I might love</p> 
<p>Her, my sweet lady, and be loved by her;</p> 
<p>This seem’d so yesterday, today death comes,</p> 
<p>And is so bitter strong, I cannot see</p> 
<p>Why I was born.</p> 
<p>But as a last request,</p> 
<p>I pray you, O kind Clisson, send some man,</p> 
<p>Some good man, mind you, to say how I died,</p> 
<p>And take my last love to her: fare-you-well,</p> 
<p>And may God keep you; I must go now, lest</p> 
<p>I grow too sick with thinking on these things;</p> 
<p>Likewise my feet are wearied of the earth,</p> 
<p>From whence I shall be lifted upright soon.</p> 
<p>[As he goes.</p> 
<p>Ah me! shamed too, I wept at fear of death;</p> 
<p>And yet not so, I only wept because</p> 
<p>There was no beautiful lady to kiss me</p> 
<p>Before I died, and sweetly wish good speed</p> 
<p>From her dear lips. O for some lady, though</p> 
<p>I saw her ne’er before; Alice, my love,</p> 
<p>I do not ask for; Clisson was right kind,</p> 
<p>If he had been a woman, I should die</p> 
<p>Without this sickness: but I am all wrong,</p> 
<p>So wrong, and hopelessly afraid to die.</p> 
<p>There, I will go.</p> 
<p>My God! how sick I am,</p> 
<p>If only she could come and kiss me now.</p> 
<p>The Hotel de la Barde, Bordeaux.</p> 
<p>The Lady Alice de la Barde looking out of a window into the street.</p> 
<p>No news yet! surely, still he holds his own:</p> 
<p>That garde stands well; I mind me passing it</p> 
<p>Some months ago; God grant the walls are strong!</p> 
<p>I heard some knights say something yestereve,</p> 
<p>I tried hard to forget: words far apart</p> 
<p>Struck on my heart something like this; one said:</p> 
<p>What eh! a Gascon with an English name,</p> 
<p>Harpdon? then nought, but afterwards: Poictou.</p> 
<p>As one who answers to a question ask’d,</p> 
<p>Then carelessly regretful came: No, no.</p> 
<p>Whereto in answer loud and eagerly,</p> 
<p>One said: Impossible? Christ, what foul play!</p> 
<p>And went off angrily; and while thenceforth</p> 
<p>I hurried gaspingly afraid, I heard:</p> 
<p>Guesclin; Five thousand men-at-arms; Clisson.</p> 
<p>My heart misgives me it is all in vain</p> 
<p>I send these succours; and in good time there</p> 
<p>Their trumpet sounds: ah! here they are; good knights,</p> 
<p>God up in Heaven keep you.</p> 
<p>If they come</p> 
<p>And find him prisoner, for I can’t believe</p> 
<p>Guesclin will slay him, even though they storm.</p> 
<p>The last horse turns the corner.</p> 
<p>God in Heaven!</p> 
<p>What have I got to thinking of at last!</p> 
<p>That thief I will not name is with Guesclin,</p> 
<p>Who loves him for his lands. My love! my love!</p> 
<p>O, if I lose you after all the past,</p> 
<p>What shall I do?</p> 
<p>I cannot bear the noise</p> 
<p>And light street out there, with this thought alive,</p> 
<p>Like any curling snake within my brain;</p> 
<p>Let me just hide my head within these soft</p> 
<p>Deep cushions, there to try and think it out.</p> 
<p>[Lying in the window-seat.</p> 
<p>I cannot hear much noise now, and I think</p> 
<p>That I shall go to sleep: it all sounds dim</p> 
<p>And faint, and I shall soon forget most things;</p> 
<p>Yea, almost that I am alive and here;</p> 
<p>It goes slow, comes slow, like a big mill-wheel</p> 
<p>On some broad stream, with long green weeds a-sway,</p> 
<p>And soft and slow it rises and it falls,</p> 
<p>Still going onward.</p> 
<p>Lying so, one kiss,</p> 
<p>And I should be in Avalon asleep,</p> 
<p>Among the poppies, and the yellow flowers;</p> 
<p>And they should brush my cheek, my hair being spread</p> 
<p>Far out among the stems; soft mice and small</p> 
<p>Eating and creeping all about my feet,</p> 
<p>Red shod and tired; and the flies should come</p> 
<p>Creeping o’er my broad eyelids unafraid;</p> 
<p>And there should be a noise of water going,</p> 
<p>Clear blue fresh water breaking on the slates,</p> 
<p>Likewise the flies should creep: God’s eyes! God help!</p> 
<p>A trumpet? I will run fast, leap adown</p> 
<p>The slippery sea-stairs, where the crabs fight.</p> 
<p>Ah!</p> 
<p>I was half dreaming, but the trumpet’s true;</p> 
<p>He stops here at our house. The Clisson arms?</p> 
<p>Ah, now for news. But I must hold my heart,</p> 
<p>And be quite gentle till he is gone out;</p> 
<p>And afterwards: but he is still alive,</p> 
<p>He must be still alive.</p> 
<p>Enter a Squire of Clisson’s.</p> 
<p>Good day, fair sir,</p>  
<p>My Lady Alice de la Barde, I come</p> 
<p>From Oliver Clisson, knight and mighty lord,</p> 
<p>Bringing you tidings: I make bold to hope</p> 
<p>You will not count me villain, even if</p> 
<p>They wring your heart, nor hold me still in hate;</p> 
<p>For I am but a mouthpiece after all,</p> 
<p>A mouthpiece, too, of one who wishes well</p>  
<p>Can you talk faster, sir,</p> 
<p>Get over all this quicker? fix your eyes</p> 
<p>On mine, I pray you, and whate’er you see,</p> 
<p>Still go on talking fast, unless I fall,</p>  
<p>I pray your pardon then,</p> 
<p>And, looking in your eyes, fair lady, say</p> 
<p>I am unhappy that your knight is dead.</p> 
<p>Take heart, and listen! let me tell you all.</p> 
<p>We were five thousand goodly men-at-arms,</p> 
<p>And scant five hundred had he in that hold:</p> 
<p>His rotten sand-stone walls were wet with rain,</p> 
<p>And fell in lumps wherever a stone hit;</p> 
<p>Yet for three days about the barrier there</p> 
<p>The deadly glaives were gather’d, laid across,</p> 
<p>And push’d and pull’d; the fourth our engines came;</p> 
<p>But still amid the crash of falling walls,</p> 
<p>And roar of lombards, rattle of hard bolts,</p> 
<p>The steady bow-strings flash’d, and still stream’d out</p> 
<p>St. George’s banner, and the seven swords,</p> 
<p>And still they cried: St. George Guienne! until</p> 
<p>Their walls were flat as Jericho’s of old,</p>  
<p>Stop, sir, and tell me if you slew him then,</p> 
<p>And where he died, if you can really mean</p>   
<p>What base-court?</p> 
<p>What do you talk of? Nay, go on, go on;</p> 
<p>’Twas only something gone within my head:</p> 
<p>Do you not know, one turns one’s head round quick,</p> 
<p>And something cracks there with sore pain? go on,</p>  
<p>Almost alone,</p> 
<p>There in the base-court fought he with his sword,</p> 
<p>Using his left hand much, more than the wont</p> 
<p>Of most knights now-a-days; our men gave back,</p> 
<p>For wheresoever he hit a downright blow,</p> 
<p>Some one fell bleeding, for no plate could hold</p> 
<p>Against the sway of body and great arm;</p> 
<p>Till he grew tired, and some man (no! not I,</p> 
<p>I swear not I, fair lady, as I live!)</p> 
<p>Thrust at him with a glaive between the knees,</p> 
<p>And threw him; down he fell, sword undermost;</p> 
<p>Many fell on him, crying out their cries,</p>  
<p>Yea, slew him: I am much too young to live,</p> 
<p>Fair God, so let me die!</p> 
<p>You have done well,</p> 
<p>Done all your message gently, pray you go,</p> 
<p>Our knights will make you cheer; moreover, take</p> 
<p>This bag of franks for your expenses.</p> 
<p>[The Squire kneels.</p> 
<p>But</p> 
<p>You do not go; still looking at my face,</p> 
<p>You kneel! what, squire, do you mock me then?</p> 
<p>You need not tell me who has set you on,</p> 
<p>But tell me only, ’tis a made-up tale.</p> 
<p>You are some lover may-be or his friend;</p> 
<p>Sir, if you loved me once, or your friend loved,</p> 
<p>Think, is it not enough that I kneel down</p> 
<p>And kiss your feet? your jest will be right good</p> 
<p>If you give in now; carry it too far,</p> 
<p>And ’twill be cruel: not yet? but you weep</p> 
<p>Almost, as though you loved me; love me then,</p> 
<p>And go to Heaven by telling all your sport,</p> 
<p>And I will kiss you then with all my heart,</p> 
<p>Upon the mouth: O! what can I do then</p>  
<p>Lady fair, forgive me still!</p> 
<p>You know I am so sorry, but my tale</p> 
<p>Is not yet finish’d:</p> 
<p>So they bound his hands,</p> 
<p>And brought him tall and pale to Guesclin’s tent,</p> 
<p>Who, seeing him, leant his head upon his hand,</p> 
<p>And ponder’d somewhile, afterwards, looking up:</p>  
<p>Yea, I know now,</p>  
<p>Yet, lady, for your own sake I say this,</p> 
<p>Yea, for my own sake, too, and Clisson’s sake.</p> 
<p>When Guesclin told him he must be hanged soon,</p> 
<p>Within a while he lifted up his head</p> 
<p>And spoke for his own life; not crouching, though,</p> 
<p>As abjectly afraid to die, nor yet</p> 
<p>Sullenly brave as many a thief will die,</p> 
<p>Nor yet as one that plays at japes with God:</p> 
<p>Few words he spoke; not so much what he said</p> 
<p>Moved us, I think, as, saying it, there played</p> 
<p>Strange tenderness from that big soldier there</p> 
<p>About his pleading; eagerness to live</p> 
<p>Because folk loved him, and he loved them back,</p> 
<p>And many gallant plans unfinish’d now</p> 
<p>For ever. Clisson’s heart, which may God bless!</p> 
<p>Was moved to pray for him, but all in vain;</p> 
<p>Wherefore I bring this message:</p> 
<p>That he waits,</p> 
<p>Still loving you, within the little church</p> 
<p>Whose windows, with the one eye of the light</p> 
<p>Over the altar, every night behold</p> 
<p>The great dim broken walls he strove to keep!</p> 
<p>There my Lord Clisson did his burial well.</p>  
<p>Thank Clisson from me, squire, and farewell!</p> 
<p>And now to keep myself from going mad.</p> 
<p>Christ! I have been a many times to church,</p> 
<p>And, ever since my mother taught me prayers,</p> 
<p>Have used them daily, but today I wish</p> 
<p>To pray another way; come face to face,</p> 
<p>O Christ, that I may clasp your knees and pray</p> 
<p>I know not what; at any rate come now</p> 
<p>From one of many places where you are,</p> 
<p>Either in Heaven amid thick angel wings,</p> 
<p>Or sitting on the altar strange with gems,</p> 
<p>Or high up in the duskness of the apse;</p> 
<p>Let us go, You and I, a long way off,</p> 
<p>To the little damp, dark, Poitevin church.</p> 
<p>While you sit on the coffin in the dark,</p> 
<p>Will I lie down, my face on the bare stone</p> 
<p>Between your feet, and chatter anything</p> 
<p>I have heard long ago. What matters it</p> 
<p>So I may keep you there, your solemn face</p> 
<p>And long hair even-flowing on each side,</p> 
<p>Until you love me well enough to speak,</p> 
<p>And give me comfort? yea, till o’er your chin,</p> 
<p>And cloven red beard the great tears roll down</p> 
<p>In pity for my misery, and I die,</p> 
<p>Kissed over by you.</p> 
<p>Eh Guesclin! if I were</p> 
<p>Like Countess Mountfort now, that kiss’d the knight,</p> 
<p>Across the salt sea come to fight for her:</p> 
<p>Ah! just to go about with many knights,</p> 
<p>Wherever you went, and somehow on one day,</p> 
<p>In a thick wood to catch you off your guard,</p> 
<p>Let you find, you and your some fifty friends,</p> 
<p>Nothing but arrows wheresoe’er you turn’d,</p> 
<p>Yea, and red crosses, great spears over them;</p> 
<p>And so, between a lane of my true men,</p> 
<p>To walk up pale and stern and tall, and with</p> 
<p>My arms on my surcoat, and his therewith,</p> 
<p>And then to make you kneel, O knight Guesclin;</p> 
<p>And then: alas! alas! when all is said,</p> 
<p>What could I do but let you go again,</p> 
<p>Being pitiful woman? I get no revenge,</p> 
<p>Whatever happens; and I get no comfort:</p> 
<p>I am but weak, and cannot move my feet,</p> 
<p>But as men bid me.</p> 
<p>Strange I do not die.</p> 
<p>Suppose this has not happen’d after all?</p> 
<p>I will lean out again and watch for news.</p> 
<p>I wonder how long I can still feel thus,</p> 
<p>As though I watch’d for news, feel as I did</p> 
<p>Just half-an-hour ago, before this news.</p> 
<p>How all the street is humming, some men sing,</p> 
<p>And some men talk; some look up at the house,</p> 
<p>Then lay their heads together and look grave:</p> 
<p>Their laughter pains me sorely in the heart;</p> 
<p>Their thoughtful talking makes my head turn round:</p> 
<p>Yea, some men sing, what is it then they sing?</p> 
<p>Eh? Launcelot, and love and fate and death:</p> 
<p>They ought to sing of him who was as wight</p> 
<p>As Launcelot or Wade, and yet avail’d</p> 
<p>Just nothing, but to fail and fail and fail,</p> 
<p>And so at last to die and leave me here,</p> 
<p>Alone and wretched; yea, perhaps they will,</p> 
<p>When many years are past, make songs of us:</p> 
<p>God help me, though, truly I never thought</p> 
<p>That I should make a story in this way,</p> 
<p>A story that his eyes can never see.</p> 
<p>[One sings from outside.]</p> 
<p>Therefore be it believed</p> 
<p>Whatsoever he grieved,</p> 
<p>When his horse was relieved,</p> 
<p>This Launcelot,</p> 
<p>Beat down on his knee,</p> 
<p>Right valiant was he</p> 
<p>God’s body to see,</p> 
<p>Though he saw it not.</p> 
<p>Right valiant to move,</p> 
<p>But for his sad love</p> 
<p>The high God above</p> 
<p>Stinted his praise.</p> 
<p>Yet so he was glad</p> 
<p>That his son, Lord Galahad,</p> 
<p>That high joyaunce had</p> 
<p>All his life-days.</p> 
<p>Sing we therefore then</p> 
<p>Launcelot’s praise again,</p> 
<p>For he wan crownés ten,</p> 
<p>If he wan not twelve.</p> 
<p>To his death from his birth</p> 
<p>He was mickle of worth,</p> 
<p>Lay him in the cold earth,</p> 
<p>A long grave ye may delve.</p> 
<p>Omnes homines benedicite!</p> 
<p>This last fitte ye may see,</p> 
<p>All men pray for me</p> 
<p>Who made this history</p> 
<p>Cunning and fairly.</p>
