<p>But, knowing now that they would have her speak,</p> 
<p>She threw her wet hair backward from her brow,</p> 
<p>Her hand close to her mouth touching her cheek,</p> 
<p>As though she had had there a shameful blow,</p> 
<p>And feeling it shameful to feel ought but shame</p> 
<p>All through her heart, yet felt her cheek burned so,</p> 
<p>She must a little touch it; like one lame</p> 
<p>She walked away from Gauwaine, with her head</p> 
<p>Still lifted up; and on her cheek of flame</p> 
<p>The tears dried quick; she stopped at last and said:</p> 
<p>O knights and lords, it seems but little skill</p> 
<p>To talk of well-known things past now and dead.</p> 
<p>God wot I ought to say, I have done ill,</p> 
<p>And pray you all forgiveness heartily!</p> 
<p>Because you must be right, such great lords; still</p> 
<p>Listen, suppose your time were come to die,</p> 
<p>And you were quite alone and very weak;</p> 
<p>Yea, laid a dying while very mightily</p> 
<p>The wind was ruffling up the narrow streak</p> 
<p>Of river through your broad lands running well:</p> 
<p>Suppose a hush should come, then some one speak:</p> 
<p>‘One of these cloths is heaven, and one is hell,</p> 
<p>Now choose one cloth for ever; which they be,</p> 
<p>I will not tell you, you must somehow tell</p> 
<p>Of your own strength and mightiness; here, see!’</p> 
<p>Yea, yea, my lord, and you to ope your eyes,</p> 
<p>At foot of your familiar bed to see</p> 
<p>A great God’s angel standing, with such dyes,</p> 
<p>Not known on earth, on his great wings, and hands,</p> 
<p>Held out two ways, light from the inner skies</p> 
<p>Showing him well, and making his commands</p> 
<p>Seem to be God’s commands, moreover, too,</p> 
<p>Holding within his hands the cloths on wands;</p> 
<p>And one of these strange choosing cloths was blue,</p> 
<p>Wavy and long, and one cut short and red;</p> 
<p>No man could tell the better of the two.</p> 
<p>After a shivering half-hour you said:</p> 
<p>‘God help! heaven’s colour, the blue;’ and he said, ‘hell.’</p> 
<p>Perhaps you then would roll upon your bed,</p> 
<p>And cry to all good men that loved you well,</p> 
<p>‘Ah Christ! if only I had known, known, known;’</p> 
<p>Launcelot went away, then I could tell,</p> 
<p>Like wisest man how all things would be, moan,</p> 
<p>And roll and hurt myself, and long to die,</p> 
<p>And yet fear much to die for what was sown.</p> 
<p>Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie,</p> 
<p>Whatever may have happened through these years,</p> 
<p>God knows I speak truth, saying that you lie.</p> 
<p>Her voice was low at first, being full of tears,</p> 
<p>But as it cleared, it grew full loud and shrill,</p> 
<p>Growing a windy shriek in all men’s ears,</p> 
<p>A ringing in their startled brains, until</p> 
<p>She said that Gauwaine lied, then her voice sunk,</p> 
<p>And her great eyes began again to fill,</p> 
<p>Though still she stood right up, and never shrunk,</p> 
<p>But spoke on bravely, glorious lady fair!</p> 
<p>Whatever tears her full lips may have drunk,</p> 
<p>She stood, and seemed to think, and wrung her hair,</p> 
<p>Spoke out at last with no more trace of shame,</p> 
<p>With passionate twisting of her body there:</p> 
<p>It chanced upon a day that Launcelot came</p> 
<p>To dwell at Arthur’s court: at Christmas-time</p> 
<p>This happened; when the heralds sung his name,</p> 
<p>Son of King Ban of Benwick, seemed to chime</p> 
<p>Along with all the bells that rang that day,</p> 
<p>O’er the white roofs, with little change of rhyme.</p> 
<p>Christmas and whitened winter passed away,</p> 
<p>And over me the April sunshine came,</p> 
<p>Made very awful with black hail-clouds, yea</p> 
<p>And in the Summer I grew white with flame,</p> 
<p>And bowed my head down: Autumn, and the sick</p> 
<p>Sure knowledge things would never be the same,</p> 
<p>However often Spring might be most thick</p> 
<p>Of blossoms and buds, smote on me, and I grew</p> 
<p>Careless of most things, let the clock tick, tick,</p> 
<p>To my unhappy pulse, that beat right through</p> 
<p>My eager body; while I laughed out loud,</p> 
<p>And let my lips curl up at false or true,</p> 
<p>Seemed cold and shallow without any cloud.</p> 
<p>Behold my judges, then the cloths were brought;</p> 
<p>While I was dizzied thus, old thoughts would crowd,</p> 
<p>Belonging to the time ere I was bought</p> 
<p>By Arthur’s great name and his little love;</p> 
<p>Must I give up for ever then, I thought,</p> 
<p>That which I deemed would ever round me move</p> 
<p>Glorifying all things; for a little word,</p> 
<p>Scarce ever meant at all, must I now prove</p> 
<p>Stone-cold for ever? Pray you, does the Lord</p> 
<p>Will that all folks should be quite happy and good?</p> 
<p>I love God now a little, if this cord</p> 
<p>Were broken, once for all what striving could</p> 
<p>Make me love anything in earth or heaven?</p> 
<p>So day by day it grew, as if one should</p> 
<p>Slip slowly down some path worn smooth and even,</p> 
<p>Down to a cool sea on a summer day;</p> 
<p>Yet still in slipping there was some small leaven</p> 
<p>Of stretched hands catching small stones by the way,</p> 
<p>Until one surely reached the sea at last,</p> 
<p>And felt strange new joy as the worn head lay</p> 
<p>Back, with the hair like sea-weed; yea all past</p> 
<p>Sweat of the forehead, dryness of the lips,</p> 
<p>Washed utterly out by the dear waves o’ercast,</p> 
<p>In the lone sea, far off from any ships!</p> 
<p>Do I not know now of a day in Spring?</p> 
<p>No minute of that wild day ever slips</p> 
<p>From out my memory; I hear thrushes sing,</p> 
<p>And wheresoever I may be, straightway</p> 
<p>Thoughts of it all come up with most fresh sting:</p> 
<p>I was half mad with beauty on that day,</p> 
<p>And went without my ladies all alone,</p> 
<p>In a quiet garden walled round every way;</p> 
<p>I was right joyful of that wall of stone,</p> 
<p>That shut the flowers and trees up with the sky,</p> 
<p>And trebled all the beauty: to the bone,</p> 
<p>Yea right through to my heart, grown very shy</p> 
<p>With weary thoughts, it pierced, and made me glad;</p> 
<p>Exceedingly glad, and I knew verily,</p> 
<p>A little thing just then had made me mad;</p> 
<p>I dared not think, as I was wont to do,</p> 
<p>Sometimes, upon my beauty; If I had</p> 
<p>Held out my long hand up against the blue,</p> 
<p>And, looking on the tenderly darken’d fingers,</p> 
<p>Thought that by rights one ought to see quite through,</p> 
<p>There, see you, where the soft still light yet lingers,</p> 
<p>Round by the edges; what should I have done,</p> 
<p>If this had joined with yellow spotted singers,</p> 
<p>And startling green drawn upward by the sun?</p> 
<p>But shouting, loosed out, see now! all my hair,</p> 
<p>And trancedly stood watching the west wind run</p> 
<p>With faintest half-heard breathing sound; why there</p> 
<p>I lose my head e’en now in doing this;</p> 
<p>But shortly listen: In that garden fair</p> 
<p>Came Launcelot walking; this is true, the kiss</p> 
<p>Wherewith we kissed in meeting that spring day,</p> 
<p>I scarce dare talk of the remember’d bliss,</p> 
<p>When both our mouths went wandering in one way,</p> 
<p>And aching sorely, met among the leaves;</p> 
<p>Our hands being left behind strained far away.</p> 
<p>Never within a yard of my bright sleeves</p> 
<p>Had Launcelot come before: and now, so nigh!</p> 
<p>After that day why is it Guenevere grieves?</p> 
<p>Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie,</p> 
<p>Whatever happened on through all those years,</p> 
<p>God knows I speak truth, saying that you lie.</p> 
<p>Being such a lady could I weep these tears</p> 
<p>If this were true? A great queen such as I</p> 
<p>Having sinn’d this way, straight her conscience sears;</p> 
<p>And afterwards she liveth hatefully,</p> 
<p>Slaying and poisoning, certes never weeps:</p> 
<p>Gauwaine be friends now, speak me lovingly.</p> 
<p>Do I not see how God’s dear pity creeps</p> 
<p>All through your frame, and trembles in your mouth?</p> 
<p>Remember in what grave your mother sleeps,</p> 
<p>Buried in some place far down in the south,</p> 
<p>Men are forgetting as I speak to you;</p> 
<p>By her head sever’d in that awful drouth</p> 
<p>Of pity that drew Agravaine’s fell blow,</p> 
<p>I pray your pity! let me not scream out</p> 
<p>For ever after, when the shrill winds blow</p> 
<p>Through half your castle-locks! let me not shout</p> 
<p>For ever after in the winter night</p> 
<p>When you ride out alone! in battle-rout</p> 
<p>Let not my rusting tears make your sword light!</p> 
<p>Ah! God of mercy, how he turns away!</p> 
<p>So, ever must I dress me to the fight,</p> 
<p>So: let God’s justice work! Gauwaine, I say,</p> 
<p>See me hew down your proofs: yea all men know</p> 
<p>Even as you said how Mellyagraunce one day,</p> 
<p>One bitter day in la Fausse Garde, for so</p> 
<p>All good knights held it after, saw:</p> 
<p>Yea, sirs, by cursed unknightly outrage; though</p> 
<p>You, Gauwaine, held his word without a flaw,</p> 
<p>This Mellyagraunce saw blood upon my bed:</p> 
<p>Whose blood then pray you? is there any law</p> 
<p>To make a queen say why some spots of red</p> 
<p>Lie on her coverlet? or will you say:</p> 
<p>Your hands are white, lady, as when you wed,</p> 
<p>Where did you bleed? and must I stammer out, Nay,</p> 
<p>I blush indeed, fair lord, only to rend</p> 
<p>My sleeve up to my shoulder, where there lay</p> 
<p>A knife-point last night: so must I defend</p> 
<p>The honour of the Lady Guenevere?</p> 
<p>Not so, fair lords, even if the world should end</p> 
<p>This very day, and you were judges here</p> 
<p>Instead of God. Did you see Mellyagraunce</p> 
<p>When Launcelot stood by him? what white fear</p> 
<p>Curdled his blood, and how his teeth did dance,</p> 
<p>His side sink in? as my knight cried and said:</p> 
<p>Slayer of unarm’d men, here is a chance!</p> 
<p>Setter of traps, I pray you guard your head,</p> 
<p>By God I am so glad to fight with you,</p> 
<p>Stripper of ladies, that my hand feels lead</p> 
<p>For driving weight; hurrah now! draw and do,</p> 
<p>For all my wounds are moving in my breast,</p> 
<p>And I am getting mad with waiting so.</p> 
<p>He struck his hands together o’er the beast,</p> 
<p>Who fell down flat, and grovell’d at his feet,</p> 
<p>And groan’d at being slain so young: At least,</p> 
<p>My knight said, rise you, sir, who are so fleet</p> 
<p>At catching ladies, half-arm’d will I fight,</p> 
<p>My left side all uncovered! then I weet,</p> 
<p>Up sprang Sir Mellyagraunce with great delight</p> 
<p>Upon his knave’s face; not until just then</p> 
<p>Did I quite hate him, as I saw my knight</p> 
<p>Along the lists look to my stake and pen</p> 
<p>With such a joyous smile, it made me sigh</p> 
<p>From agony beneath my waist-chain, when</p> 
<p>The fight began, and to me they drew nigh;</p> 
<p>Ever Sir Launcelot kept him on the right,</p> 
<p>And traversed warily, and ever high</p> 
<p>And fast leapt caitiff’s sword, until my knight</p> 
<p>Sudden threw up his sword to his left hand,</p> 
<p>Caught it, and swung it; that was all the fight,</p> 
<p>Except a spout of blood on the hot land;</p> 
<p>For it was hottest summer; and I know</p> 
<p>I wonder’d how the fire, while I should stand,</p> 
<p>And burn, against the heat, would quiver so,</p> 
<p>Yards above my head; thus these matters went;</p> 
<p>Which things were only warnings of the woe</p> 
<p>That fell on me. Yet Mellyagraunce was shent,</p> 
<p>For Mellyagraunce had fought against the Lord;</p> 
<p>Therefore, my lords, take heed lest you be blent</p> 
<p>With all this wickedness; say no rash word</p> 
<p>Against me, being so beautiful; my eyes,</p> 
<p>Wept all away to grey, may bring some sword</p> 
<p>To drown you in your blood; see my breast rise,</p> 
<p>Like waves of purple sea, as here I stand;</p> 
<p>And how my arms are moved in wonderful wise,</p> 
<p>Yea also at my full heart’s strong command,</p> 
<p>See through my long throat how the words go up</p> 
<p>In ripples to my mouth; how in my hand</p> 
<p>The shadow lies like wine within a cup</p> 
<p>Of marvellously colour’d gold; yea now</p> 
<p>This little wind is rising, look you up,</p> 
<p>And wonder how the light is falling so</p> 
<p>Within my moving tresses: will you dare,</p> 
<p>When you have looked a little on my brow,</p> 
<p>To say this thing is vile? or will you care</p> 
<p>For any plausible lies of cunning woof,</p> 
<p>When you can see my face with no lie there</p> 
<p>For ever? am I not a gracious proof:</p> 
<p>But in your chamber Launcelot was found:</p> 
<p>Is there a good knight then would stand aloof,</p> 
<p>When a queen says with gentle queenly sound:</p> 
<p>O true as steel come now and talk with me,</p> 
<p>I love to see your step upon the ground</p> 
<p>Unwavering, also well I love to see</p> 
<p>That gracious smile light up your face, and hear</p> 
<p>Your wonderful words, that all mean verily</p> 
<p>The thing they seem to mean: good friend, so dear</p> 
<p>To me in everything, come here to-night,</p> 
<p>Or else the hours will pass most dull and drear;</p> 
<p>If you come not, I fear this time I might</p> 
<p>Get thinking over much of times gone by,</p> 
<p>When I was young, and green hope was in sight:</p> 
<p>For no man cares now to know why I sigh;</p> 
<p>And no man comes to sing me pleasant songs,</p> 
<p>Nor any brings me the sweet flowers that lie</p> 
<p>So thick in the gardens; therefore one so longs</p> 
<p>To see you, Launcelot; that we may be</p> 
<p>Like children once again, free from all wrongs</p> 
<p>Just for one night. Did he not come to me?</p> 
<p>What thing could keep true Launcelot away</p> 
<p>If I said, Come? there was one less than three</p> 
<p>In my quiet room that night, and we were gay;</p> 
<p>Till sudden I rose up, weak, pale, and sick,</p> 
<p>Because a bawling broke our dream up, yea</p> 
<p>I looked at Launcelot’s face and could not speak,</p> 
<p>For he looked helpless too, for a little while;</p> 
<p>Then I remember how I tried to shriek,</p> 
<p>And could not, but fell down; from tile to tile</p> 
<p>The stones they threw up rattled o’er my head</p> 
<p>And made me dizzier; till within a while</p> 
<p>My maids were all about me, and my head</p> 
<p>On Launcelot’s breast was being soothed away</p> 
<p>From its white chattering, until Launcelot said:</p> 
<p>By God! I will not tell you more today,</p> 
<p>Judge any way you will: what matters it?</p> 
<p>You know quite well the story of that fray,</p> 
<p>How Launcelot still’d their bawling, the mad fit</p> 
<p>That caught up Gauwaine: all, all, verily,</p> 
<p>But just that which would save me; these things flit.</p> 
<p>Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie,</p> 
<p>Whatever may have happen’d these long years,</p> 
<p>God knows I speak truth, saying that you lie!</p> 
<p>All I have said is truth, by Christ’s dear tears.</p> 
<p>She would not speak another word, but stood</p> 
<p>Turn’d sideways; listening, like a man who hears</p> 
<p>His brother’s trumpet sounding through the wood</p> 
<p>Of his foes’ lances. She lean’d eagerly,</p> 
<p>And gave a slight spring sometimes, as she could</p> 
<p>At last hear something really; joyfully</p> 
<p>Her cheek grew crimson, as the headlong speed</p> 
<p>Of the roan charger drew all men to see,</p> 
<p>The knight who came was Launcelot at good need.</p>
