<p>Had she come all the way for this,</p> 
<p>To part at last without a kiss?</p> 
<p>Yea, had she borne the dirt and rain</p> 
<p>That her own eyes might see him slain</p> 
<p>Beside the haystack in the floods?</p> 
<p>Along the dripping leafless woods,</p> 
<p>The stirrup touching either shoe,</p> 
<p>She rode astride as troopers do;</p> 
<p>With kirtle kilted to her knee,</p> 
<p>To which the mud splash’d wretchedly;</p> 
<p>And the wet dripp’d from every tree</p> 
<p>Upon her head and heavy hair,</p> 
<p>And on her eyelids broad and fair;</p> 
<p>The tears and rain ran down her face.</p> 
<p>By fits and starts they rode apace,</p> 
<p>And very often was his place</p> 
<p>Far off from her; he had to ride</p> 
<p>Ahead, to see what might betide</p> 
<p>When the roads cross’d; and sometimes, when</p> 
<p>There rose a murmuring from his men,</p> 
<p>Had to turn back with promises.</p> 
<p>Ah me! she had but little ease;</p> 
<p>And often for pure doubt and dread</p> 
<p>She sobb’d, made giddy in the head</p> 
<p>By the swift riding; while, for cold,</p> 
<p>Her slender fingers scarce could hold</p> 
<p>The wet reins; yea, and scarcely, too,</p> 
<p>She felt the foot within her shoe</p> 
<p>Against the stirrup: all for this,</p> 
<p>To part at last without a kiss</p> 
<p>Beside the haystack in the floods.</p> 
<p>For when they near’d that old soak’d hay,</p> 
<p>They saw across the only way</p> 
<p>That Judas, Godmar, and the three</p> 
<p>Red running lions dismally</p> 
<p>Grinn’d from his pennon, under which</p> 
<p>In one straight line along the ditch,</p> 
<p>They counted thirty heads.</p> 
<p>So then,</p> 
<p>While Robert turn’d round to his men,</p> 
<p>She saw at once the wretched end,</p> 
<p>And, stooping down, tried hard to rend</p> 
<p>Her coif the wrong way from her head,</p> 
<p>And hid her eyes; while Robert said:</p> 
<p>Nay, love, ’tis scarcely two to one,</p> 
<p>At Poictiers where we made them run</p> 
<p>So fast: why, sweet my love, good cheer,</p> 
<p>The Gascon frontier is so near,</p> 
<p>Nought after this.</p> 
<p>But: O! she said,</p> 
<p>My God! my God! I have to tread</p> 
<p>The long way back without you; then</p> 
<p>The court at Paris; those six men;</p> 
<p>The gratings of the Chatelet;</p> 
<p>The swift Seine on some rainy day</p> 
<p>Like this, and people standing by,</p> 
<p>And laughing, while my weak hands try</p> 
<p>To recollect how strong men swim.</p> 
<p>All this, or else a life with him,</p> 
<p>For which I should be damned at last,</p> 
<p>Would God that this next hour were past!</p> 
<p>He answer’d not, but cried his cry,</p> 
<p>St. George for Marny! cheerily;</p> 
<p>And laid his hand upon her rein.</p> 
<p>Alas! no man of all his train</p> 
<p>Gave back that cheery cry again;</p> 
<p>And, while for rage his thumb beat fast</p> 
<p>Upon his sword-hilt, some one cast</p> 
<p>About his neck a kerchief long,</p> 
<p>And bound him.</p> 
<p>Then they went along</p> 
<p>To Godmar; who said: Now, Jehane,</p> 
<p>Your lover’s life is on the wane</p> 
<p>So fast, that, if this very hour</p> 
<p>You yield not as my paramour,</p> 
<p>He will not see the rain leave off:</p> 
<p>Nay, keep your tongue from gibe and scoff</p> 
<p>Sir Robert, or I slay you now.</p> 
<p>She laid her hand upon her brow,</p> 
<p>Then gazed upon the palm, as though</p> 
<p>She thought her forehead bled, and: No!</p> 
<p>She said, and turn’d her head away,</p> 
<p>As there were nothing else to say,</p> 
<p>And everything were settled: red</p> 
<p>Grew Godmar’s face from chin to head:</p> 
<p>Jehane, on yonder hill there stands</p> 
<p>My castle, guarding well my lands;</p> 
<p>What hinders me from taking you,</p> 
<p>And doing that I list to do</p> 
<p>To your fair wilful body, while</p> 
<p>Your knight lies dead?</p> 
<p>A wicked smile</p> 
<p>Wrinkled her face, her lips grew thin,</p> 
<p>A long way out she thrust her chin:</p> 
<p>You know that I should strangle you</p> 
<p>While you were sleeping; or bite through</p> 
<p>Your throat, by God’s help: ah! she said,</p> 
<p>Lord Jesus, pity your poor maid!</p> 
<p>For in such wise they hem me in,</p> 
<p>I cannot choose but sin and sin,</p> 
<p>Whatever happens: yet I think</p> 
<p>They could not make me eat or drink,</p> 
<p>And so should I just reach my rest.</p> 
<p>Nay, if you do not my behest,</p> 
<p>O Jehane! though I love you well,</p> 
<p>Said Godmar, would I fail to tell</p> 
<p>All that I know? Foul lies, she said.</p> 
<p>Eh? lies, my Jehane? by God’s head,</p> 
<p>At Paris folks would deem them true!</p> 
<p>Do you know, Jehane, they cry for you:</p> 
<p>Jehane the brown! Jehane the brown!</p> 
<p>Give us Jehane to burn or drown!</p> 
<p>Eh! gag me Robert! Sweet my friend,</p> 
<p>This were indeed a piteous end</p> 
<p>For those long fingers, and long feet,</p> 
<p>And long neck, and smooth shoulders sweet;</p> 
<p>An end that few men would forget</p> 
<p>That saw it. So, an hour yet:</p> 
<p>Consider, Jehane, which to take</p> 
<p>Of life or death!</p> 
<p>So, scarce awake,</p> 
<p>Dismounting, did she leave that place,</p> 
<p>And totter some yards: with her face</p> 
<p>Turn’d upward to the sky she lay,</p> 
<p>Her head on a wet heap of hay,</p> 
<p>And fell asleep: and while she slept,</p> 
<p>And did not dream, the minutes crept</p> 
<p>Round to the twelve again; but she,</p> 
<p>Being waked at last, sigh’d quietly,</p> 
<p>And strangely childlike came, and said:</p> 
<p>I will not. Straightway Godmar’s head,</p> 
<p>As though it hung on strong wires, turn’d</p> 
<p>Most sharply round, and his face burn’d.</p> 
<p>For Robert, both his eyes were dry,</p> 
<p>He could not weep, but gloomily</p> 
<p>He seem’d to watch the rain; yea, too,</p> 
<p>His lips were firm; he tried once more</p> 
<p>To touch her lips; she reached out, sore</p> 
<p>And vain desire so tortured them,</p> 
<p>The poor grey lips, and now the hem</p> 
<p>Of his sleeve brush’d them.</p> 
<p>With a start</p> 
<p>Up Godmar rose, thrust them apart;</p> 
<p>From Robert’s throat he loosed the bands</p> 
<p>Of silk and mail; with empty hands</p> 
<p>Held out, she stood and gazed, and saw,</p> 
<p>The long bright blade without a flaw</p> 
<p>Glide out from Godmar’s sheath, his hand</p> 
<p>In Robert’s hair; she saw him bend</p> 
<p>Back Robert’s head; she saw him send</p> 
<p>The thin steel down; the blow told well,</p> 
<p>Right backward the knight Robert fell,</p> 
<p>And moaned as dogs do, being half dead,</p> 
<p>Unwitting, as I deem: so then</p> 
<p>Godmar turn’d grinning to his men,</p> 
<p>Who ran, some five or six, and beat</p> 
<p>His head to pieces at their feet.</p> 
<p>Then Godmar turn’d again and said:</p> 
<p>So, Jehane, the first fitte is read!</p> 
<p>Take note, my lady, that your way</p> 
<p>Lies backward to the Chatelet!</p> 
<p>She shook her head and gazed awhile</p> 
<p>At her cold hands with a rueful smile,</p> 
<p>As though this thing had made her mad.</p> 
<p>This was the parting that they had</p> 
<p>Beside the haystack in the floods.</p>
