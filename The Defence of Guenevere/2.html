<p>Hot August noon: already on that day</p> 
<p>Since sunrise through the Wiltshire downs, most sad</p> 
<p>Of mouth and eye, he had gone leagues of way;</p> 
<p>Ay and by night, till whether good or bad</p> 
<p>He was, he knew not, though he knew perchance</p> 
<p>That he was Launcelot, the bravest knight</p> 
<p>Of all who since the world was, have borne lance,</p> 
<p>Or swung their swords in wrong cause or in right.</p> 
<p>Nay, he knew nothing now, except that where</p> 
<p>The Glastonbury gilded towers shine,</p> 
<p>A lady dwelt, whose name was Guenevere;</p> 
<p>This he knew also; that some fingers twine,</p> 
<p>Not only in a man’s hair, even his heart,</p> 
<p>(Making him good or bad I mean,) but in his life,</p> 
<p>Skies, earth, men’s looks and deeds, all that has part,</p> 
<p>Not being ourselves, in that half-sleep, half-strife,</p> 
<p>(Strange sleep, strange strife,) that men call living; so</p> 
<p>Was Launcelot most glad when the moon rose,</p> 
<p>Because it brought new memories of her. “Lo,</p> 
<p>Between the trees a large moon, the wind lows</p> 
<p>Not loud, but as a cow begins to low,</p> 
<p>Wishing for strength to make the herdsman hear:</p> 
<p>The ripe corn gathereth dew; yea, long ago,</p> 
<p>In the old garden life, my Guenevere</p> 
<p>Loved to sit still among the flowers, till night</p> 
<p>Had quite come on, hair loosen’d, for she said,</p> 
<p>Smiling like heaven, that its fairness might</p> 
<p>Draw up the wind sooner to cool her head.</p> 
<p>Now while I ride how quick the moon gets small,</p> 
<p>As it did then: I tell myself a tale</p> 
<p>That will not last beyond the whitewashed wall,</p> 
<p>Thoughts of some joust must help me through the vale,</p> 
<p>Keep this till after: How Sir Gareth ran</p> 
<p>A good course that day under my Queen’s eyes,</p> 
<p>And how she sway’d laughing at Dinadan.</p> 
<p>No. Back again, the other thoughts will rise,</p> 
<p>And yet I think so fast ’twill end right soon:</p> 
<p>Verily then I think, that Guenevere,</p> 
<p>Made sad by dew and wind, and tree-barred moon,</p> 
<p>Did love me more than ever, was more dear</p> 
<p>To me than ever, she would let me lie</p> 
<p>And kiss her feet, or, if I sat behind,</p> 
<p>Would drop her hand and arm most tenderly,</p> 
<p>And touch my mouth. And she would let me wind</p> 
<p>Her hair around my neck, so that it fell</p> 
<p>Upon my red robe, strange in the twilight</p> 
<p>With many unnamed colours, till the bell</p> 
<p>Of her mouth on my cheek sent a delight</p> 
<p>Through all my ways of being; like the stroke</p> 
<p>Wherewith God threw all men upon the face</p> 
<p>When he took Enoch, and when Enoch woke</p> 
<p>With a changed body in the happy place.</p> 
<p>Once, I remember, as I sat beside,</p> 
<p>She turn’d a little, and laid back her head,</p> 
<p>And slept upon my breast; I almost died</p> 
<p>In those night-watches with my love and dread.</p> 
<p>There lily-like she bow’d her head and slept,</p> 
<p>And I breathed low, and did not dare to move,</p> 
<p>But sat and quiver’d inwardly, thoughts crept,</p> 
<p>And frighten’d me with pulses of my Love.</p> 
<p>The stars shone out above the doubtful green</p> 
<p>Of her bodice, in the green sky overhead;</p> 
<p>Pale in the green sky were the stars I ween,</p> 
<p>Because the moon shone like a star she shed</p> 
<p>When she dwelt up in heaven a while ago,</p> 
<p>And ruled all things but God: the night went on,</p> 
<p>The wind grew cold, and the white moon grew low,</p> 
<p>One hand had fallen down, and now lay on</p> 
<p>My cold stiff palm; there were no colours then</p> 
<p>For near an hour, and I fell asleep</p> 
<p>In spite of all my striving, even when</p> 
<p>I held her whose name-letters make me leap.</p> 
<p>I did not sleep long, feeling that in sleep</p> 
<p>I did some loved one wrong, so that the sun</p> 
<p>Had only just arisen from the deep</p> 
<p>Still land of colours, when before me one</p> 
<p>Stood whom I knew, but scarcely dared to touch,</p> 
<p>She seemed to have changed so in the night;</p> 
<p>Moreover she held scarlet lilies, such</p> 
<p>As Maiden Margaret bears upon the light</p> 
<p>Of the great church walls, natheless did I walk</p> 
<p>Through the fresh wet woods, and the wheat that morn,</p> 
<p>Touching her hair and hand and mouth, and talk</p> 
<p>Of love we held, nigh hid among the corn.</p> 
<p>Back to the palace, ere the sun grew high,</p> 
<p>We went, and in a cool green room all day</p> 
<p>I gazed upon the arras giddily,</p> 
<p>Where the wind set the silken kings a-sway.</p> 
<p>I could not hold her hand, or see her face;</p> 
<p>For which may God forgive me! but I think,</p> 
<p>Howsoever, that she was not in that place.</p> 
<p>These memories Launcelot was quick to drink;</p> 
<p>And when these fell, some paces past the wall,</p> 
<p>There rose yet others, but they wearied more,</p> 
<p>And tasted not so sweet; they did not fall</p> 
<p>So soon, but vaguely wrenched his strained heart sore</p> 
<p>In shadowy slipping from his grasp: these gone,</p> 
<p>A longing followed; if he might but touch</p> 
<p>That Guenevere at once! Still night, the lone</p> 
<p>Grey horse’s head before him vex’d him much,</p> 
<p>In steady nodding over the grey road:</p> 
<p>Still night, and night, and night, and emptied heart</p> 
<p>Of any stories; what a dismal load</p> 
<p>Time grew at last, yea, when the night did part,</p> 
<p>And let the sun flame over all, still there</p> 
<p>The horse’s grey ears turn’d this way and that,</p> 
<p>And still he watch’d them twitching in the glare</p> 
<p>Of the morning sun, behind them still he sat,</p> 
<p>Quite wearied out with all the wretched night,</p> 
<p>Until about the dustiest of the day,</p> 
<p>On the last down’s brow he drew his rein in sight</p> 
<p>Of the Glastonbury roofs that choke the way.</p> 
<p>And he was now quite giddy as before,</p> 
<p>When she slept by him, tired out, and her hair</p> 
<p>Was mingled with the rushes on the floor,</p> 
<p>And he, being tired too, was scarce aware</p> 
<p>Of her presence; yet as he sat and gazed,</p> 
<p>A shiver ran throughout him, and his breath</p> 
<p>Came slower, he seem’d suddenly amazed,</p> 
<p>As though he had not heard of Arthur’s death.</p> 
<p>This for a moment only, presently</p> 
<p>He rode on giddy still, until he reach’d</p> 
<p>A place of apple-trees, by the thorn-tree</p> 
<p>Wherefrom St. Joseph in the days past preached.</p> 
<p>Dazed there he laid his head upon a tomb,</p> 
<p>Not knowing it was Arthur’s, at which sight</p> 
<p>One of her maidens told her, ‘He is come,’</p> 
<p>And she went forth to meet him; yet a blight</p> 
<p>Had settled on her, all her robes were black,</p> 
<p>With a long white veil only; she went slow,</p> 
<p>As one walks to be slain, her eyes did lack</p> 
<p>Half her old glory, yea, alas! the glow</p> 
<p>Had left her face and hands; this was because</p> 
<p>As she lay last night on her purple bed,</p> 
<p>Wishing for morning, grudging every pause</p> 
<p>Of the palace clocks, until that Launcelot’s head</p> 
<p>Should lie on her breast, with all her golden hair</p> 
<p>Each side: when suddenly the thing grew drear,</p> 
<p>In morning twilight, when the grey downs bare</p> 
<p>Grew into lumps of sin to Guenevere.</p> 
<p>At first she said no word, but lay quite still,</p> 
<p>Only her mouth was open, and her eyes</p> 
<p>Gazed wretchedly about from hill to hill;</p> 
<p>As though she asked, not with so much surprise</p> 
<p>As tired disgust, what made them stand up there</p> 
<p>So cold and grey. After, a spasm took</p> 
<p>Her face, and all her frame, she caught her hair,</p> 
<p>All her hair, in both hands, terribly she shook,</p> 
<p>And rose till she was sitting in the bed,</p> 
<p>Set her teeth hard, and shut her eyes and seem’d</p> 
<p>As though she would have torn it from her head,</p> 
<p>Natheless she dropp’d it, lay down, as she deem’d</p> 
<p>It matter’d not whatever she might do:</p> 
<p>O Lord Christ! pity on her ghastly face!</p> 
<p>Those dismal hours while the cloudless blue</p> 
<p>Drew the sun higher: He did give her grace;</p> 
<p>Because at last she rose up from her bed,</p> 
<p>And put her raiment on, and knelt before</p> 
<p>The blessed rood, and with her dry lips said,</p> 
<p>Muttering the words against the marble floor:</p> 
<p>‘Unless you pardon, what shall I do, Lord,</p> 
<p>But go to hell? and there see day by day</p> 
<p>Foul deed on deed, hear foulest word on word,</p> 
<p>For ever and ever, such as on the way</p> 
<p>To Camelot I heard once from a churl,</p> 
<p>That curled me up upon my jennet’s neck</p> 
<p>With bitter shame; how then, Lord, should I curl</p> 
<p>For ages and for ages? dost thou reck</p> 
<p>That I am beautiful, Lord, even as you</p> 
<p>And your dear mother? why did I forget</p> 
<p>You were so beautiful, and good, and true,</p> 
<p>That you loved me so, Guenevere? O yet</p> 
<p>If even I go to hell, I cannot choose</p> 
<p>But love you, Christ, yea, though I cannot keep</p> 
<p>From loving Launcelot; O Christ! must I lose</p> 
<p>My own heart’s love? see, though I cannot weep,</p> 
<p>Yet am I very sorry for my sin;</p> 
<p>Moreover, Christ, I cannot bear that hell,</p> 
<p>I am most fain to love you, and to win</p> 
<p>A place in heaven some time: I cannot tell:</p> 
<p>Speak to me, Christ! I kiss, kiss, kiss your feet;</p> 
<p>Ah! now I weep!’ The maid said, ‘By the tomb</p> 
<p>He waiteth for you, lady,’ coming fleet,</p> 
<p>Not knowing what woe filled up all the room.</p> 
<p>So Guenevere rose and went to meet him there,</p> 
<p>He did not hear her coming, as he lay</p> 
<p>On Arthur’s head, till some of her long hair</p> 
<p>Brush’d on the new-cut stone: ‘Well done! to pray</p> 
<p>For Arthur, my dear Lord, the greatest king</p> 
<p>That ever lived.’ ‘Guenevere! Guenevere!</p> 
<p>Do you not know me, are you gone mad? fling</p> 
<p>Your arms and hair about me, lest I fear</p> 
<p>You are not Guenevere, but some other thing.’</p> 
<p>‘Pray you forgive me, fair lord Launcelot!</p> 
<p>I am not mad, but I am sick; they cling,</p> 
<p>God’s curses, unto such as I am; not</p> 
<p>Ever again shall we twine arms and lips.’</p> 
<p>‘Yea, she is mad: thy heavy law, O Lord,</p> 
<p>Is very tight about her now, and grips</p> 
<p>Her poor heart, so that no right word</p> 
<p>Can reach her mouth; so, Lord, forgive her now,</p> 
<p>That she not knowing what she does, being mad,</p> 
<p>Kills me in this way; Guenevere, bend low</p> 
<p>And kiss me once! for God’s love kiss me! sad</p> 
<p>Though your face is, you look much kinder now;</p> 
<p>Yea once, once for the last time kiss me, lest I die.’</p> 
<p>‘Christ! my hot lips are very near his brow,</p> 
<p>Help me to save his soul! Yea, verily,</p> 
<p>Across my husband’s head, fair Launcelot!</p> 
<p>Fair serpent mark’d with V upon the head!</p> 
<p>This thing we did while yet he was alive,</p> 
<p>Why not, O twisting knight, now he is dead?</p> 
<p>Yea, shake! shake now and shiver! if you can</p> 
<p>Remember anything for agony,</p> 
<p>Pray you remember how when the wind ran</p> 
<p>One cool spring evening through fair aspen-tree,</p> 
<p>And elm and oak about the palace there,</p> 
<p>The king came back from battle, and I stood</p> 
<p>To meet him, with my ladies, on the stair,</p> 
<p>My face made beautiful with my young blood.’</p> 
<p>‘Will she lie now, Lord God?’ ‘Remember too,</p> 
<p>Wrung heart, how first before the knights there came</p> 
<p>A royal bier, hung round with green and blue,</p> 
<p>About it shone great tapers with sick flame.</p> 
<p>And thereupon Lucius, the Emperor,</p> 
<p>Lay royal-robed, but stone-cold now and dead,</p> 
<p>Not able to hold sword or sceptre more,</p> 
<p>But not quite grim; because his cloven head</p> 
<p>Bore no marks now of Launcelot’s bitter sword,</p> 
<p>Being by embalmers deftly solder’d up;</p> 
<p>So still it seem’d the face of a great lord,</p> 
<p>Being mended as a craftsman mends a cup.</p> 
<p>Also the heralds sung rejoicingly</p> 
<p>To their long trumpets; Fallen under shield,</p> 
<p>Here lieth Lucius, King of Italy,</p> 
<p>Slain by Lord Launcelot in open field.</p> 
<p>Thereat the people shouted: Launcelot!</p> 
<p>And through the spears I saw you drawing nigh,</p> 
<p>You and Lord Arthur: nay, I saw you not,</p> 
<p>But rather Arthur, God would not let die,</p> 
<p>I hoped, these many years; he should grow great,</p> 
<p>And in his great arms still encircle me,</p> 
<p>Kissing my face, half blinded with the heat</p> 
<p>Of king’s love for the queen I used to be.</p> 
<p>Launcelot, Launcelot, why did he take your hand,</p> 
<p>When he had kissed me in his kingly way?</p> 
<p>Saying: This is the knight whom all the land</p> 
<p>Calls Arthur’s banner, sword, and shield today;</p> 
<p>Cherish him, love. Why did your long lips cleave</p> 
<p>In such strange way unto my fingers then?</p> 
<p>So eagerly glad to kiss, so loath to leave</p> 
<p>When you rose up? Why among helmed men</p> 
<p>Could I always tell you by your long strong arms,</p> 
<p>And sway like an angel’s in your saddle there?</p> 
<p>Why sicken’d I so often with alarms</p> 
<p>Over the tilt-yard? Why were you more fair</p> 
<p>Than aspens in the autumn at their best?</p> 
<p>Why did you fill all lands with your great fame,</p> 
<p>So that Breuse even, as he rode, fear’d lest</p> 
<p>At turning of the way your shield should flame?</p> 
<p>Was it nought then, my agony and strife?</p> 
<p>When as day passed by day, year after year,</p> 
<p>I found I could not live a righteous life!</p> 
<p>Didst ever think queens held their truth for dear?</p> 
<p>O, but your lips say: Yea, but she was cold</p> 
<p>Sometimes, always uncertain as the spring;</p> 
<p>When I was sad she would be overbold,</p> 
<p>Longing for kisses. When war-bells did ring,</p> 
<p>The back-toll’d bells of noisy Camelot.</p> 
<p>‘Now, Lord God, listen! listen, Guenevere,</p> 
<p>Though I am weak just now, I think there’s not</p> 
<p>A man who dares to say: You hated her,</p> 
<p>And left her moaning while you fought your fill</p> 
<p>In the daisied meadows! lo you her thin hand,</p> 
<p>That on the carven stone can not keep still,</p> 
<p>Because she loves me against God’s command,</p> 
<p>Has often been quite wet with tear on tear,</p> 
<p>Tears Launcelot keeps somewhere, surely not</p> 
<p>In his own heart, perhaps in Heaven, where</p> 
<p>He will not be these ages.’ ‘Launcelot!</p> 
<p>Loud lips, wrung heart! I say when the bells rang,</p> 
<p>The noisy back-toll’d bells of Camelot,</p> 
<p>There were two spots on earth, the thrushes sang</p> 
<p>In the lonely gardens where my love was not,</p> 
<p>Where I was almost weeping; I dared not</p> 
<p>Weep quite in those days, lest one maid should say,</p> 
<p>In tittering whispers: Where is Launcelot</p> 
<p>To wipe with some kerchief those tears away?</p> 
<p>Another answer sharply with brows knit,</p> 
<p>And warning hand up, scarcely lower though:</p> 
<p>You speak too loud, see you, she heareth it,</p> 
<p>This tigress fair has claws, as I well know,</p> 
<p>As Launcelot knows too, the poor knight! well-a-day!</p> 
<p>Why met he not with Iseult from the West,</p> 
<p>Or better still, Iseult of Brittany?</p> 
<p>Perchance indeed quite ladyless were best.</p> 
<p>Alas, my maids, you loved not overmuch</p> 
<p>Queen Guenevere, uncertain as sunshine</p> 
<p>In March; forgive me! for my sin being such,</p> 
<p>About my whole life, all my deeds did twine,</p> 
<p>Made me quite wicked; as I found out then,</p> 
<p>I think; in the lonely palace where each morn</p> 
<p>We went, my maids and I, to say prayers when</p> 
<p>They sang mass in the chapel on the lawn.</p> 
<p>And every morn I scarce could pray at all,</p> 
<p>For Launcelot’s red-golden hair would play,</p> 
<p>Instead of sunlight, on the painted wall,</p> 
<p>Mingled with dreams of what the priest did say;</p> 
<p>Grim curses out of Peter and of Paul;</p> 
<p>Judging of strange sins in Leviticus;</p> 
<p>Another sort of writing on the wall,</p> 
<p>Scored deep across the painted heads of us.</p> 
<p>Christ sitting with the woman at the well,</p> 
<p>And Mary Magdalen repenting there,</p> 
<p>Her dimmed eyes scorch’d and red at sight of hell</p> 
<p>So hardly ‘scaped, no gold light on her hair.</p> 
<p>And if the priest said anything that seemed</p> 
<p>To touch upon the sin they said we did,</p> 
<p>(This in their teeth) they looked as if they deem’d</p> 
<p>That I was spying what thoughts might be hid</p> 
<p>Under green-cover’d bosoms, heaving quick</p> 
<p>Beneath quick thoughts; while they grew red with shame,</p> 
<p>And gazed down at their feet: while I felt sick,</p> 
<p>And almost shriek’d if one should call my name.</p> 
<p>The thrushes sang in the lone garden there:</p> 
<p>But where you were the birds were scared I trow:</p> 
<p>Clanging of arms about pavilions fair,</p> 
<p>Mixed with the knights’ laughs; there, as I well know,</p> 
<p>Rode Launcelot, the king of all the band,</p> 
<p>And scowling Gauwaine, like the night in day,</p> 
<p>And handsome Gareth, with his great white hand</p> 
<p>Curl’d round the helm-crest, ere he join’d the fray;</p> 
<p>And merry Dinadan with sharp dark face,</p> 
<p>All true knights loved to see; and in the fight</p> 
<p>Great Tristram, and though helmed you could trace</p> 
<p>In all his bearing the frank noble knight;</p> 
<p>And by him Palomydes, helmet off,</p> 
<p>He fought, his face brush’d by his hair,</p> 
<p>Red heavy swinging hair; he fear’d a scoff</p> 
<p>So overmuch, though what true knight would dare</p> 
<p>To mock that face, fretted with useless care,</p> 
<p>And bitter useless striving after love?</p> 
<p>O Palomydes, with much honour bear</p> 
<p>Beast Glatysaunt upon your shield, above</p> 
<p>Your helm that hides the swinging of your hair,</p> 
<p>And think of Iseult, as your sword drives through</p> 
<p>Much mail and plate: O God, let me be there</p> 
<p>A little time, as I was long ago!</p> 
<p>Because stout Gareth lets his spear fall low,</p> 
<p>Gauwaine and Launcelot, and Dinadan</p> 
<p>Are helm’d and waiting; let the trumpets go!</p> 
<p>Bend over, ladies, to see all you can!</p> 
<p>Clench teeth, dames, yea, clasp hands, for Gareth’s spear</p> 
<p>Throws Kay from out his saddle, like a stone</p> 
<p>From a castle-window when the foe draws near:</p> 
<p>Iseult! Sir Dinadan rolleth overthrown.</p> 
<p>Iseult! again: the pieces of each spear</p> 
<p>Fly fathoms up, and both the great steeds reel;</p> 
<p>Tristram for Iseult! Iseult! and Guenevere!</p> 
<p>The ladies’ names bite verily like steel.</p> 
<p>They bite: bite me, Lord God! I shall go mad,</p> 
<p>Or else die kissing him, he is so pale,</p> 
<p>He thinks me mad already, O bad! bad!</p> 
<p>Let me lie down a little while and wail.’</p> 
<p>‘No longer so, rise up, I pray you, love,</p> 
<p>And slay me really, then we shall be heal’d,</p> 
<p>Perchance, in the aftertime by God above.’</p> 
<p>‘Banner of Arthur, with black-bended shield</p> 
<p>Sinister-wise across the fair gold ground!</p> 
<p>Here let me tell you what a knight you are,</p> 
<p>O sword and shield of Arthur! you are found</p> 
<p>A crooked sword, I think, that leaves a scar</p> 
<p>On the bearer’s arm, so be he thinks it straight,</p> 
<p>Twisted Malay’s crease beautiful blue-grey,</p> 
<p>Poison’d with sweet fruit; as he found too late,</p> 
<p>My husband Arthur, on some bitter day!</p> 
<p>O sickle cutting hemlock the day long!</p> 
<p>That the husbandman across his shoulder hangs,</p> 
<p>And, going homeward about evensong,</p> 
<p>Dies the next morning, struck through by the fangs!</p> 
<p>Banner, and sword, and shield, you dare not die,</p> 
<p>Lest you meet Arthur in the other world,</p> 
<p>And, knowing who you are, he pass you by,</p> 
<p>Taking short turns that he may watch you curl’d,</p> 
<p>Body and face and limbs in agony,</p> 
<p>Lest he weep presently and go away,</p> 
<p>Saying: I loved him once, with a sad sigh,</p> 
<p>Now I have slain him, Lord, let me go too, I pray.</p> 
<p>[Launcelot falls.</p> 
<p>Alas! alas! I know not what to do,</p> 
<p>If I run fast it is perchance that I</p> 
<p>May fall and stun myself, much better so,</p> 
<p>Never, never again! not even when I die.’</p> 
<p>LAUNCELOT, on awaking.</p> 
<p>‘I stretch’d my hands towards her and fell down,</p> 
<p>How long I lay in swoon I cannot tell:</p> 
<p>My head and hands were bleeding from the stone,</p> 
<p>When I rose up, also I heard a bell.’</p>
