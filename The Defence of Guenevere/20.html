<p>Midways of a wallèd garden,</p> 
<p>In the happy poplar land,</p> 
<p>Did an ancient castle stand,</p> 
<p>With an old knight for a warden.</p> 
<p>Many scarlet bricks there were</p> 
<p>In its walls, and old grey stone;</p> 
<p>Over which red apples shone</p> 
<p>At the right time of the year.</p> 
<p>On the bricks the green moss grew.</p> 
<p>Yellow lichen on the stone,</p> 
<p>Over which red apples shone;</p> 
<p>Little war that castle knew.</p> 
<p>Deep green water fill’d the moat,</p> 
<p>Each side had a red-brick lip,</p> 
<p>Green and mossy with the drip</p> 
<p>Of dew and rain; there was a boat</p> 
<p>Of carven wood, with hangings green</p> 
<p>About the stern; it was great bliss</p> 
<p>For lovers to sit there and kiss</p> 
<p>In the hot summer noons, not seen.</p> 
<p>Across the moat the fresh west wind</p> 
<p>In very little ripples went;</p> 
<p>The way the heavy aspens bent</p> 
<p>Towards it, was a thing to mind.</p> 
<p>The painted drawbridge over it</p> 
<p>Went up and down with gilded chains,</p> 
<p>’Twas pleasant in the summer rains</p> 
<p>Within the bridge-house there to sit.</p> 
<p>There were five swans that ne’er did eat</p> 
<p>The water-weeds, for ladies came</p> 
<p>Each day, and young knights did the same,</p> 
<p>And gave them cakes and bread for meat.</p> 
<p>They had a house of painted wood,</p> 
<p>A red roof gold-spiked over it,</p> 
<p>Wherein upon their eggs to sit</p> 
<p>Week after week; no drop of blood,</p> 
<p>Drawn from men’s bodies by sword-blows,</p> 
<p>Came ever there, or any tear;</p> 
<p>Most certainly from year to year</p> 
<p>’Twas pleasant as a Provence rose.</p> 
<p>The banners seem’d quite full of ease,</p> 
<p>That over the turret-roofs hung down;</p> 
<p>The battlements could get no frown</p> 
<p>From the flower-moulded cornices.</p> 
<p>Who walked in that garden there?</p> 
<p>Miles and Giles and Isabeau,</p> 
<p>Tall Jehane du Castel beau,</p> 
<p>Alice of the golden hair,</p> 
<p>Big Sir Gervaise, the good knight,</p> 
<p>Fair Ellayne le Violet,</p> 
<p>Mary, Constance fille de fay,</p> 
<p>Many dames with footfall light.</p> 
<p>Whosoever wander’d there,</p> 
<p>Whether it be dame or knight,</p> 
<p>Half of scarlet, half of white</p> 
<p>Their raiment was; of roses fair</p> 
<p>Each wore a garland on the head,</p> 
<p>At Ladies’ Gard the way was so:</p> 
<p>Fair Jehane du Castel beau</p> 
<p>Wore her wreath till it was dead.</p> 
<p>Little joy she had of it,</p> 
<p>Of the raiment white and red,</p> 
<p>Or the garland on her head,</p> 
<p>She had none with whom to sit</p> 
<p>In the carven boat at noon;</p> 
<p>None the more did Jehane weep,</p> 
<p>She would only stand and keep</p> 
<p>Saying: He will be here soon!</p> 
<p>Many times in the long day</p> 
<p>Miles and Giles and Gervaise passed,</p> 
<p>Holding each some white hand fast,</p> 
<p>Every time they heard her say:</p> 
<p>Summer cometh to an end,</p> 
<p>Undern cometh after noon;</p> 
<p>Golden wings will be here soon,</p> 
<p>What if I some token send?</p> 
<p>Wherefore that night within the hall,</p> 
<p>With open mouth and open eyes,</p> 
<p>Like some one listening with surprise,</p> 
<p>She sat before the sight of all.</p> 
<p>Stoop’d down a little she sat there,</p> 
<p>With neck stretch’d out and chin thrown up,</p> 
<p>One hand around a golden cup;</p> 
<p>And strangely with her fingers fair</p> 
<p>She beat some tune upon the gold;</p> 
<p>The minstrels in the gallery</p> 
<p>Sung: Arthur, who will never die,</p> 
<p>In Avallon he groweth old.</p> 
<p>And when the song was ended, she</p> 
<p>Rose and caught up her gown and ran;</p> 
<p>None stopp’d her eager face and wan</p> 
<p>Of all that pleasant company.</p> 
<p>Right so within her own chamber</p> 
<p>Upon her bed she sat; and drew</p> 
<p>Her breath in quick gasps; till she knew</p> 
<p>That no man follow’d after her.</p> 
<p>She took the garland from her head,</p> 
<p>Loosed all her hair, and let it lie</p> 
<p>Upon the coverlet; thereby</p> 
<p>She laid the gown of white and red;</p> 
<p>And she took off her scarlet shoon,</p> 
<p>And bared her feet; still more and more</p> 
<p>Her sweet face redden’d; evermore</p> 
<p>She murmur’d: He will be here soon;</p> 
<p>Truly he cannot fail to know</p> 
<p>My tender body waits him here;</p> 
<p>And if he knows, I have no fear</p> 
<p>For poor Jehane du Castel beau.</p> 
<p>She took a sword within her hand,</p> 
<p>Whose hilts were silver, and she sung</p> 
<p>Somehow like this, wild words that rung</p> 
<p>A long way over the moonlit land:</p> 
<p>Gold wings across the sea!</p> 
<p>Grey light from tree to tree,</p> 
<p>Gold hair beside my knee,</p> 
<p>I pray thee come to me,</p> 
<p>Gold wings!</p> 
<p>The water slips,</p> 
<p>The red-bill’d moorhen dips.</p> 
<p>Sweet kisses on red lips;</p> 
<p>Alas! the red rust grips,</p> 
<p>And the blood-red dagger rips,</p> 
<p>Yet, O knight, come to me!</p> 
<p>Are not my blue eyes sweet?</p> 
<p>The west wind from the wheat</p> 
<p>Blows cold across my feet;</p> 
<p>Is it not time to meet</p> 
<p>Gold wings across the sea?</p> 
<p>White swans on the green moat,</p> 
<p>Small feathers left afloat</p> 
<p>By the blue-painted boat;</p> 
<p>Swift running of the stoat,</p> 
<p>Sweet gurgling note by note</p> 
<p>Of sweet music.</p> 
<p>O gold wings,</p> 
<p>Listen how gold hair sings,</p> 
<p>And the Ladies Castle rings,</p> 
<p>Gold wings across the sea.</p> 
<p>I sit on a purple bed,</p> 
<p>Outside, the wall is red,</p> 
<p>Thereby the apple hangs,</p> 
<p>And the wasp, caught by the fangs,</p> 
<p>Dies in the autumn night,</p> 
<p>And the bat flits till light,</p> 
<p>And the love-crazèd knight</p> 
<p>Kisses the long wet grass:</p> 
<p>The weary days pass,</p> 
<p>Gold wings across the sea.</p> 
<p>Gold wings across the sea!</p> 
<p>Moonlight from tree to tree,</p> 
<p>Sweet hair laid on my knee,</p> 
<p>O, sweet knight, come to me.</p> 
<p>Gold wings, the short night slips,</p> 
<p>The white swan’s long neck drips,</p> 
<p>I pray thee kiss my lips,</p> 
<p>Gold wings across the sea!</p> 
<p>No answer through the moonlit night;</p> 
<p>No answer in the cold grey dawn;</p> 
<p>No answer when the shaven lawn</p> 
<p>Grew green, and all the roses bright.</p> 
<p>Her tired feet look’d cold and thin,</p> 
<p>Her lips were twitch’d, and wretched tears,</p> 
<p>Some, as she lay, roll’d past her ears,</p> 
<p>Some fell from off her quivering chin.</p> 
<p>Her long throat, stretched to its full length,</p> 
<p>Rose up and fell right brokenly;</p> 
<p>As though the unhappy heart was nigh</p> 
<p>Striving to break with all its strength.</p> 
<p>And when she slipp’d from off the bed,</p> 
<p>Her cramp’d feet would not hold her; she</p> 
<p>Sank down and crept on hand and knee,</p> 
<p>On the window-sill she laid her head.</p> 
<p>There, with crooked arm upon the sill,</p> 
<p>She look’d out, muttering dismally:</p> 
<p>There is no sail upon the sea,</p> 
<p>No pennon on the empty hill.</p> 
<p>I cannot stay here all alone,</p> 
<p>Or meet their happy faces here,</p> 
<p>And wretchedly I have no fear;</p> 
<p>A little while, and I am gone.</p> 
<p>Therewith she rose upon her feet,</p> 
<p>And totter’d; cold and misery</p> 
<p>Still made the deep sobs come, till she</p> 
<p>At last stretch’d out her fingers sweet,</p> 
<p>And caught the great sword in her hand;</p> 
<p>And, stealing down the silent stair,</p> 
<p>Barefooted in the morning air.</p> 
<p>And only in her smock, did stand</p> 
<p>Upright upon the green lawn grass;</p> 
<p>And hope grew in her as she said:</p> 
<p>I have thrown off the white and red,</p> 
<p>And pray God it may come to pass</p> 
<p>I meet him; if ten years go by</p> 
<p>Before I meet him; if, indeed,</p> 
<p>Meanwhile both soul and body bleed,</p> 
<p>Yet there is end of misery,</p> 
<p>And I have hope. He could not come,</p> 
<p>But I can go to him and show</p> 
<p>These new things I have got to know,</p> 
<p>And make him speak, who has been dumb.</p> 
<p>O Jehane! the red morning sun</p> 
<p>Changed her white feet to glowing gold,</p> 
<p>Upon her smock, on crease and fold,</p> 
<p>Changed that to gold which had been dun.</p> 
<p>O Miles, and Giles, and Isabeau,</p> 
<p>Fair Ellayne le Violet,</p> 
<p>Mary, Constance fille de fay!</p> 
<p>Where is Jehane du Castel beau?</p> 
<p>O big Gervaise ride apace!</p> 
<p>Down to the hard yellow sand,</p> 
<p>Where the water meets the land.</p> 
<p>This is Jehane by her face.</p> 
<p>Why has she a broken sword?</p> 
<p>Mary! she is slain outright;</p> 
<p>Verily a piteous sight;</p> 
<p>Take her up without a word!</p> 
<p>Giles and Miles and Gervaise there,</p> 
<p>Ladies’ Gard must meet the war;</p> 
<p>Whatsoever knights these are,</p> 
<p>Man the walls withouten fear!</p> 
<p>Axes to the apple-trees,</p> 
<p>Axes to the aspens tall!</p> 
<p>Barriers without the wall</p> 
<p>May be lightly made of these.</p> 
<p>O poor shivering Isabeau;</p> 
<p>Poor Ellayne le Violet,</p> 
<p>Bent with fear! we miss today</p> 
<p>Brave Jehane du Castel beau.</p> 
<p>O poor Mary, weeping so!</p> 
<p>Wretched Constance fille de fay!</p> 
<p>Verily we miss today</p> 
<p>Fair Jehane du Castel beau.</p> 
<p>The apples now grow green and sour</p> 
<p>Upon the mouldering castle-wall,</p> 
<p>Before they ripen there they fall:</p> 
<p>There are no banners on the tower,</p> 
<p>The draggled swans most eagerly eat</p> 
<p>The green weeds trailing in the moat;</p> 
<p>Inside the rotting leaky boat</p> 
<p>You see a slain man’s stiffen’d feet.</p>
