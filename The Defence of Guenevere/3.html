<p>It is the longest night in all the year,</p> 
<p>Near on the day when the Lord Christ was born;</p> 
<p>Six hours ago I came and sat down here,</p> 
<p>And ponder’d sadly, wearied and forlorn.</p> 
<p>The winter wind that pass’d the chapel door,</p> 
<p>Sang out a moody tune, that went right well</p> 
<p>With mine own thoughts: I look’d down on the floor,</p> 
<p>Between my feet, until I heard a bell</p> 
<p>Sound a long way off through the forest deep,</p> 
<p>And toll on steadily; a drowsiness</p> 
<p>Came on me, so that I fell half asleep,</p> 
<p>As I sat there not moving: less and less</p> 
<p>I saw the melted snow that hung in beads</p> 
<p>Upon my steel-shoes; less and less I saw</p> 
<p>Between the tiles the bunches of small weeds:</p> 
<p>Heartless and stupid, with no touch of awe</p> 
<p>Upon me, half-shut eyes upon the ground,</p> 
<p>I thought: O Galahad! the days go by,</p> 
<p>Stop and cast up now that which you have found,</p> 
<p>So sorely you have wrought and painfully.</p> 
<p>Night after night your horse treads down alone</p> 
<p>The sere damp fern, night after night you sit</p> 
<p>Holding the bridle like a man of stone,</p> 
<p>Dismal, unfriended: what thing comes of it?</p> 
<p>And what if Palomydes also ride,</p> 
<p>And over many a mountain and bare heath</p> 
<p>Follow the questing beast with none beside?</p> 
<p>Is he not able still to hold his breath</p> 
<p>With thoughts of Iseult? doth he not grow pale</p> 
<p>With weary striving, to seem best of all</p> 
<p>To her, ‘as she is best,’ he saith? to fail</p> 
<p>Is nothing to him, he can never fall.</p> 
<p>For unto such a man love-sorrow is</p> 
<p>So dear a thing unto his constant heart,</p> 
<p>That even if he never win one kiss,</p> 
<p>Or touch from Iseult, it will never part.</p> 
<p>And he will never know her to be worse</p> 
<p>Than in his happiest dreams he thinks she is:</p> 
<p>Good knight, and faithful, you have ‘scaped the curse</p> 
<p>In wonderful-wise; you have great store of bliss.</p> 
<p>Yea, what if Father Launcelot ride out,</p> 
<p>Can he not think of Guenevere’s arms, round</p> 
<p>Warm and lithe, about his neck, and shout</p> 
<p>Till all the place grows joyful with the sound?</p> 
<p>And when he lists can often see her face,</p> 
<p>And think, ‘Next month I kiss you, or next week,</p> 
<p>And still you think of me’: therefore the place</p> 
<p>Grows very pleasant, whatsoever he seek.</p> 
<p>But me, who ride alone, some carle shall find</p> 
<p>Dead in my arms in the half-melted snow,</p> 
<p>When all unkindly with the shifting wind,</p> 
<p>The thaw comes on at Candlemas: I know</p> 
<p>Indeed that they will say: ‘This Galahad</p> 
<p>If he had lived had been a right good knight;</p> 
<p>Ah! poor chaste body!’ but they will be glad,</p> 
<p>Not most alone, but all, when in their sight</p> 
<p>That very evening in their scarlet sleeves</p> 
<p>The gay-dress’d minstrels sing; no maid will talk</p> 
<p>Of sitting on my tomb, until the leaves,</p> 
<p>Grown big upon the bushes of the walk,</p> 
<p>East of the Palace-pleasaunce, make it hard</p> 
<p>To see the minster therefrom: well-a-day!</p> 
<p>Before the trees by autumn were well bared,</p> 
<p>I saw a damozel with gentle play,</p> 
<p>Within that very walk say last farewell</p> 
<p>To her dear knight, just riding out to find</p> 
<p>(Why should I choke to say it?) the Sangreal,</p> 
<p>And their last kisses sunk into my mind,</p> 
<p>Yea, for she stood lean’d forward on his breast,</p> 
<p>Rather, scarce stood; the back of one dear hand,</p> 
<p>That it might well be kiss’d, she held and press’d</p> 
<p>Against his lips; long time they stood there, fann’d</p> 
<p>By gentle gusts of quiet frosty wind,</p> 
<p>Till Mador de la porte a-going by,</p> 
<p>And my own horsehoofs roused them; they untwined,</p> 
<p>And parted like a dream. In this way I,</p> 
<p>With sleepy face bent to the chapel floor,</p> 
<p>Kept musing half asleep, till suddenly</p> 
<p>A sharp bell rang from close beside the door,</p> 
<p>And I leapt up when something pass’d me by,</p> 
<p>Shrill ringing going with it, still half blind</p> 
<p>I stagger’d after, a great sense of awe</p> 
<p>At every step kept gathering on my mind,</p> 
<p>Thereat I have no marvel, for I saw</p> 
<p>One sitting on the altar as a throne,</p> 
<p>Whose face no man could say he did not know,</p> 
<p>And though the bell still rang, he sat alone,</p> 
<p>With raiment half blood-red, half white as snow.</p> 
<p>Right so I fell upon the floor and knelt,</p> 
<p>Not as one kneels in church when mass is said,</p> 
<p>But in a heap, quite nerveless, for I felt</p> 
<p>The first time what a thing was perfect dread.</p> 
<p>But mightily the gentle voice came down:</p> 
<p>‘Rise up, and look and listen, Galahad,</p> 
<p>Good knight of God, for you will see no frown</p> 
<p>Upon my face; I come to make you glad.</p> 
<p>For that you say that you are all alone,</p> 
<p>I will be with you always, and fear not</p> 
<p>You are uncared for, though no maiden moan</p> 
<p>Above your empty tomb; for Launcelot,</p> 
<p>He in good time shall be my servant too,</p> 
<p>Meantime, take note whose sword first made him knight,</p> 
<p>And who has loved him alway, yea, and who</p> 
<p>Still trusts him alway, though in all men’s sight,</p> 
<p>He is just what you know, O Galahad,</p> 
<p>This love is happy even as you say,</p> 
<p>But would you for a little time be glad,</p> 
<p>To make ME sorry long, day after day?</p> 
<p>Her warm arms round his neck half throttle ME,</p> 
<p>The hot love-tears burn deep like spots of lead,</p> 
<p>Yea, and the years pass quick: right dismally</p> 
<p>Will Launcelot at one time hang his head;</p> 
<p>Yea, old and shrivell’d he shall win my love.</p> 
<p>Poor Palomydes fretting out his soul!</p> 
<p>Not always is he able, son, to move</p> 
<p>His love, and do it honour: needs must roll</p> 
<p>The proudest destrier sometimes in the dust,</p> 
<p>And then ’tis weary work; he strives beside</p> 
<p>Seem better than he is, so that his trust</p> 
<p>Is always on what chances may betide;</p> 
<p>And so he wears away, my servant, too,</p> 
<p>When all these things are gone, and wretchedly</p> 
<p>He sits and longs to moan for Iseult, who</p> 
<p>Is no care now to Palomydes: see,</p> 
<p>O good son Galahad, upon this day,</p> 
<p>Now even, all these things are on your side,</p> 
<p>But these you fight not for; look up, I say,</p> 
<p>And see how I can love you, for no pride</p> 
<p>Closes your eyes, no vain lust keeps them down.</p> 
<p>See now you have ME always; following</p> 
<p>That holy vision, Galahad, go on,</p> 
<p>Until at last you come to ME to sing</p> 
<p>In Heaven always, and to walk around</p> 
<p>The garden where I am.’ He ceased, my face</p> 
<p>And wretched body fell upon the ground;</p> 
<p>And when I look’d again, the holy place</p> 
<p>Was empty; but right so the bell again</p> 
<p>Came to the chapel-door, there entered</p> 
<p>Two angels first, in white, without a stain,</p> 
<p>And scarlet wings, then, after them, a bed</p> 
<p>Four ladies bore, and set it down beneath</p> 
<p>The very altar-step, and while for fear</p> 
<p>I scarcely dared to move or draw my breath,</p> 
<p>Those holy ladies gently came a-near,</p> 
<p>And quite unarm’d me, saying: ‘Galahad,</p> 
<p>Rest here awhile and sleep, and take no thought</p> 
<p>Of any other thing than being glad;</p> 
<p>Hither the Sangreal will be shortly brought,</p> 
<p>Yet must you sleep the while it stayeth here.’</p> 
<p>Right so they went away, and I, being weary,</p> 
<p>Slept long and dream’d of Heaven: the bell comes near,</p> 
<p>I doubt it grows to morning. Miserere!</p>  
<p>O servant of the high God, Galahad!</p> 
<p>Rise and be arm’d: the Sangreal is gone forth</p> 
<p>Through the great forest, and you must be had</p> 
<p>Unto the sea that lieth on the north:</p> 
<p>There shall you find the wondrous ship wherein</p> 
<p>The spindles of King Solomon are laid,</p> 
<p>And the sword that no man draweth without sin,</p> 
<p>But if he be most pure: and there is stay’d,</p> 
<p>Hard by, Sir Launcelot, whom you will meet</p> 
<p>In some short space upon that ship: first, though,</p> 
<p>Will come here presently that lady sweet,</p> 
<p>Sister of Percival, whom you well know,</p> 
<p>And with her Bors and Percival: stand now,</p>  
<p>Galahad,</p> 
<p>That I may stand so close beneath your brow,</p>  
<p>That I may stand and touch you with my hand,</p>  
<p>That I may kneel while up above you stand,</p> 
<p>And gaze at me, O holy Galahad,</p>  
<p>O gentle knight,</p> 
<p>That you bow down to us in reverence,</p> 
<p>We are most glad, I, Katherine, with delight</p>  
<p>Galahad, we go hence,</p> 
<p>For here, amid the straying of the snow,</p> 
<p>Come Percival’s sister, Bors, and Percival.</p>  
<p>How still and quiet everything seems now:</p> 
<p>They come, too, for I hear the horsehoofs fall.</p> 
<p>Enter Sir Bors, Sir Percival, and his Sister.</p> 
<p>Fair friends and gentle lady, God you save!</p> 
<p>A many marvels have been here to-night;</p> 
<p>Tell me what news of Launcelot you have,</p>  
<p>Why, as for seeing that same holy thing,</p> 
<p>As we were riding slowly side by side,</p> 
<p>An hour ago, we heard a sweet voice sing,</p> 
<p>And through the bare twigs saw a great light glide,</p> 
<p>With many-colour’d raiment, but far off;</p> 
<p>And so pass’d quickly: from the court nought good;</p> 
<p>Poor merry Dinadan, that with jape and scoff</p> 
<p>Kept us all merry, in a little wood</p> 
<p>Was found all hack’d and dead: Sir Lionel</p> 
<p>And Gauwaine have come back from the great quest,</p> 
<p>Just merely shamed; and Lauvaine, who loved well</p> 
<p>Your father Launcelot, at the king’s behest</p> 
<p>Went out to seek him, but was almost slain,</p> 
<p>Perhaps is dead now; everywhere</p> 
<p>The knights come foil’d from the great quest, in vain;</p> 
<p>In vain they struggle for the vision fair.</p>
