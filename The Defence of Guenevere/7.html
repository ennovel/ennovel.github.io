<p>And if you meet the Canon of Chimay,</p> 
<p>As going to Ortaise you well may do,</p> 
<p>Greet him from John of Castel Neuf, and say</p> 
<p>All that I tell you, for all this is true.</p> 
<p>This Geffray Teste Noire was a Gascon thief,</p> 
<p>Who, under shadow of the English name,</p> 
<p>Pilled all such towns and countries as were lief</p> 
<p>To King Charles and St. Denis; thought it blame</p> 
<p>If anything escaped him; so my lord,</p> 
<p>The Duke of Berry, sent Sir John Bonne Lance,</p> 
<p>And other knights, good players with the sword,</p> 
<p>To check this thief, and give the land a chance.</p> 
<p>Therefore we set our bastides round the tower</p> 
<p>That Geffray held, the strong thief! like a king,</p> 
<p>High perch’d upon the rock of Ventadour,</p> 
<p>Hopelessly strong by Christ! It was mid spring,</p> 
<p>When first I joined the little army there</p> 
<p>With ten good spears; Auvergne is hot, each day</p> 
<p>We sweated armed before the barrier;</p> 
<p>Good feats of arms were done there often. Eh?</p> 
<p>Your brother was slain there? I mind me now,</p> 
<p>A right good man-at-arms, God pardon him!</p> 
<p>I think ’twas Geffray smote him on the brow</p> 
<p>With some spiked axe, and while he totter’d, dim</p> 
<p>About the eyes, the spear of Alleyne Roux</p> 
<p>Slipped through his camaille and his throat; well, well!</p> 
<p>Alleyne is paid now; your name Alleyne too?</p> 
<p>Mary! how strange! but this tale I would tell:</p> 
<p>For spite of all our bastides, damned Blackhead</p> 
<p>Would ride abroad whene’er he chose to ride,</p> 
<p>We could not stop him; many a burgher bled</p> 
<p>Dear gold all round his girdle; far and wide</p> 
<p>The villaynes dwelt in utter misery</p> 
<p>‘Twixt us and thief Sir Geffray; hauled this way</p> 
<p>By Sir Bonne Lance at one time; he gone by,</p> 
<p>Down comes this Teste Noire on another day.</p> 
<p>And therefore they dig up the stone, grind corn,</p> 
<p>Hew wood, draw water, yea, they lived, in short,</p> 
<p>As I said just now, utterly forlorn,</p> 
<p>Till this our knave and blackhead was out-fought.</p> 
<p>So Bonne Lance fretted, thinking of some trap</p> 
<p>Day after day, till on a time he said:</p> 
<p>John of Newcastle, if we have good hap,</p> 
<p>We catch our thief in two days. How? I said.</p> 
<p>Why, Sir, today he rideth out again,</p> 
<p>Hoping to take well certain sumpter mules</p> 
<p>From Carcassonne, going with little train,</p> 
<p>Because, forsooth, he thinketh us mere fools;</p> 
<p>But if we set an ambush in some wood,</p> 
<p>He is but dead: so, Sir, take thirty spears</p> 
<p>To Verville forest, if it seem you good.</p> 
<p>Then felt I like the horse in Job, who hears</p> 
<p>The dancing trumpet sound, and we went forth;</p> 
<p>And my red lion on the spear-head flapped,</p> 
<p>As faster than the cool wind we rode north,</p> 
<p>Towards the wood of Verville; thus it happed.</p> 
<p>We rode a soft pace on that day, while spies</p> 
<p>Got news about Sir Geffray: the red wine</p> 
<p>Under the road-side bush was clear; the flies,</p> 
<p>The dragon-flies I mind me most, did shine</p> 
<p>In brighter arms than ever I put on;</p> 
<p>So: Geffray, said our spies, would pass that way</p> 
<p>Next day at sundown: then he must be won;</p> 
<p>And so we enter’d Verville wood next day,</p> 
<p>In the afternoon; through it the highway runs,</p> 
<p>‘Twixt copses of green hazel, very thick,</p> 
<p>And underneath, with glimmering of suns,</p> 
<p>The primroses are happy; the dews lick</p> 
<p>The soft green moss: ‘Put cloths about your arms,</p> 
<p>Lest they should glitter; surely they will go</p> 
<p>In a long thin line, watchful for alarms,</p> 
<p>With all their carriages of booty; so,</p> 
<p>Lay down my pennon in the grass: Lord God.</p> 
<p>What have we lying here? will they be cold,</p> 
<p>I wonder, being so bare, above the sod,</p> 
<p>Instead of under? This was a knight too, fold</p> 
<p>Lying on fold of ancient rusted mail;</p> 
<p>No plate at all, gold rowels to the spurs,</p> 
<p>And see the quiet gleam of turquoise pale</p> 
<p>Along the ceinture; but the long time blurs</p> 
<p>Even the tinder of his coat to nought,</p> 
<p>Except these scraps of leather; see how white</p> 
<p>The skull is, loose within the coif! He fought</p> 
<p>A good fight, maybe, ere he was slain quite.</p> 
<p>No armour on the legs too; strange in faith!</p> 
<p>A little skeleton for a knight, though: ah!</p> 
<p>This one is bigger, truly without scathe</p> 
<p>His enemies escaped not! ribs driven out far;</p> 
<p>That must have reach’d the heart, I doubt: how now,</p> 
<p>What say you, Aldovrand, a woman? why?’</p> 
<p>Under the coif a gold wreath on the brow,</p> 
<p>Yea, see the hair not gone to powder, lie,</p> 
<p>Golden, no doubt, once: yea, and very small,</p> 
<p>This for a knight; but for a dame, my lord,</p> 
<p>These loose-hung bones seem shapely still, and tall.</p> 
<p>Didst ever see a woman’s bones, my Lord?</p> 
<p>Often, God help me! I remember when</p> 
<p>I was a simple boy, fifteen years old,</p> 
<p>The Jacquerie froze up the blood of men</p> 
<p>With their fell deeds, not fit now to be told.</p> 
<p>God help again! we enter’d Beauvais town,</p> 
<p>Slaying them fast, whereto I help’d, mere boy</p> 
<p>As I was then; we gentles cut them down,</p> 
<p>These burners and defilers, with great joy.</p> 
<p>Reason for that, too, in the great church there</p> 
<p>These fiends had lit a fire, that soon went out,</p> 
<p>The church at Beauvais being so great and fair:</p> 
<p>My father, who was by me, gave a shout</p> 
<p>Between a beast’s howl and a woman’s scream,</p> 
<p>Then, panting, chuckled to me: ‘John, look! look!</p> 
<p>Count the dames’ skeletons!’ From some bad dream</p> 
<p>Like a man just awaked, my father shook;</p> 
<p>And I, being faint with smelling the burnt bones,</p> 
<p>And very hot with fighting down the street,</p> 
<p>And sick of such a life, fell down, with groans</p> 
<p>My head went weakly nodding to my feet.</p> 
<p>— An arrow had gone through her tender throat,</p> 
<p>And her right wrist was broken; then I saw</p> 
<p>The reason why she had on that war-coat,</p> 
<p>Their story came out clear without a flaw;</p> 
<p>For when he knew that they were being waylaid,</p> 
<p>He threw it over her, yea, hood and all;</p> 
<p>Whereby he was much hack’d, while they were stay’d</p> 
<p>By those their murderers; many an one did fall</p> 
<p>Beneath his arm, no doubt, so that he clear’d</p> 
<p>Their circle, bore his death-wound out of it;</p> 
<p>But as they rode, some archer least afear’d</p> 
<p>Drew a strong bow, and thereby she was hit.</p> 
<p>Still as he rode he knew not she was dead,</p> 
<p>Thought her but fainted from her broken wrist,</p> 
<p>He bound with his great leathern belt: she bled?</p> 
<p>Who knows! he bled too, neither was there miss’d</p> 
<p>The beating of her heart, his heart beat well</p> 
<p>For both of them, till here, within this wood,</p> 
<p>He died scarce sorry; easy this to tell;</p> 
<p>After these years the flowers forget their blood.</p> 
<p>How could it be? never before that day,</p> 
<p>However much a soldier I might be,</p> 
<p>Could I look on a skeleton and say</p> 
<p>I care not for it, shudder not: now see,</p> 
<p>Over those bones I sat and pored for hours,</p> 
<p>And thought, and dream’d, and still I scarce could see</p> 
<p>The small white bones that lay upon the flowers,</p> 
<p>But evermore I saw the lady; she</p> 
<p>With her dear gentle walking leading in,</p> 
<p>By a chain of silver twined about her wrists,</p> 
<p>Her loving knight, mounted and arm’d to win</p> 
<p>Great honour for her, fighting in the lists.</p> 
<p>O most pale face, that brings such joy and sorrow</p> 
<p>Into men’s hearts (yea, too, so piercing sharp</p> 
<p>That joy is, that it marcheth nigh to sorrow</p> 
<p>For ever, like an overwinded harp).</p> 
<p>Your face must hurt me always: pray you now,</p> 
<p>Doth it not hurt you too? seemeth some pain</p> 
<p>To hold you always, pain to hold your brow</p> 
<p>So smooth, unwrinkled ever; yea again,</p> 
<p>Your long eyes where the lids seem like to drop,</p> 
<p>Would you not, lady, were they shut fast, feel</p> 
<p>Far merrier? there so high they will not stop,</p> 
<p>They are most sly to glide forth and to steal</p> 
<p>Into my heart; I kiss their soft lids there,</p> 
<p>And in green gardens scarce can stop my lips</p> 
<p>From wandering on your face, but that your hair</p> 
<p>Falls down and tangles me, back my face slips.</p> 
<p>Or say your mouth, I saw you drink red wine</p> 
<p>Once at a feast; how slowly it sank in,</p> 
<p>As though you fear’d that some wild fate might twine</p> 
<p>Within that cup, and slay you for a sin.</p> 
<p>And when you talk your lips do arch and move</p> 
<p>In such wise that a language new I know</p> 
<p>Besides their sound; they quiver, too, with love</p> 
<p>When you are standing silent; know this, too,</p> 
<p>I saw you kissing once, like a curved sword</p> 
<p>That bites with all its edge, did your lips lie,</p> 
<p>Curled gently, slowly, long time could afford</p> 
<p>For caught-up breathings: like a dying sigh</p> 
<p>They gather’d up their lines and went away,</p> 
<p>And still kept twitching with a sort of smile,</p> 
<p>As likely to be weeping presently;</p> 
<p>Your hands too, how I watch’d them all the while!</p> 
<p>Cry out St. Peter now, quoth Aldovrand;</p> 
<p>I cried, St. Peter! broke out from the wood</p> 
<p>With all my spears; we met them hand to hand,</p> 
<p>And shortly slew them; natheless, by the rood,</p> 
<p>We caught not Blackhead then, or any day;</p> 
<p>Months after that he died at last in bed,</p> 
<p>From a wound pick’d up at a barrier-fray;</p> 
<p>That same year’s end a steel bolt in the head,</p> 
<p>And much bad living killed Teste Noire at last;</p> 
<p>John Froissart knoweth he is dead by now,</p> 
<p>No doubt, but knoweth not this tale just past;</p> 
<p>Perchance then you can tell him what I show.</p> 
<p>In my new castle, down beside the Eure,</p> 
<p>There is a little chapel of squared stone,</p> 
<p>Painted inside and out; in green nook pure</p> 
<p>There did I lay them, every wearied bone;</p> 
<p>And over it they lay, with stone-white hands</p> 
<p>Clasped fast together, hair made bright with gold;</p> 
<p>This Jaques Picard, known through many lands,</p> 
<p>Wrought cunningly; he’s dead now: I am old.</p>
