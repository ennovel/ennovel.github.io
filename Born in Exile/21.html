Her health was in general excellent, and she had no disposition to nurse imaginary ailments, but when some slight disorder broke the routine of her life she made the most of it, enjoying—much as children do—the importance with which for the time it invested her. At such seasons she was wont to regard herself with a mildly despondent compassion, to feel that her family and her friends held her of slight account; she spoke in a tone of conscious resignation, often with a forgiving smile. When the girls redoubled their attentions, and soothed her with gentle words, she would close her eyes and sigh, seeming to remind them that they would know her value when she was no more.</p> 
<p>‘You are hoarse, mother,’ Sidwell said to her, when they met at breakfast.</p> 
<p>‘Am I, dear? You know I felt rather afraid of the journey. I hope I shan’t be laid up.’</p> 
<p>Sidwell advised her not to leave the house today. Having seen the invalid comfortably established in an upper room, she went into the city on business which could not be delayed. On her way occurred the meeting with Peak, but of this, on her return, she made no mention. Mother and daughter had luncheon upstairs, and Sidwell was full of affectionate solicitude.</p> 
<p>‘This afternoon you had better lie down for an hour or two,’ she said.</p> 
<p>‘Do you think so? Just drop a line to father, and warn him that we may kept here for some time.’</p> 
<p>‘Shall I send for Dr Endacott?’</p> 
<p>‘Just as you like, dear.’</p> 
<p>But Mrs. Warricombe had eaten such an excellent lunch, that Sidwell could not feel uneasy.</p> 
<p>‘We’ll see how you are this evening. At all events, it will be safer for you not to go downstairs. If you lie quiet for an hour or two, I can look for those pamphlets that father wants.’</p> 
<p>‘Just as you like, dear.’</p> 
<p>By three o’clock the invalid was calmly slumbering. Having entered the bedroom on tiptoe and heard regular breathing, Sidwell went down and for a few minutes lingered about the hall. A servant came to her for instructions on some domestic matter; when this was dismissed she mentioned that, if anyone called, she would be found in the library.</p> 
<p>The pamphlets of which her father had spoken were soon discovered. She laid them aside, and seated herself by the fire, but without leaning back. At any sound within or outside the house she moved her head to listen. Her look was anxious, but the gleam of her eyes expressed pleasurable agitation.</p> 
<p>At half-past three she went into the drawing-room, where all the furniture was draped, and the floor bare. Standing where she could look from a distance through one of the windows, at which the blind had been raised, she waited for a quarter of an hour. Then the chill atmosphere drove her back to the fireside. In the study, evidences of temporary desertion were less oppressive, but the windows looked only upon a sequestered part of the garden. Sidwell desired to watch the approach from the high-road, and in a few minutes she was again in the drawing-room. But scarcely had she closed the door behind her when a ringing of the visitors’ bell sounded with unfamiliar distinctness. She started, hastened from the room, fled into the library, and had time to seat herself before she heard the footsteps of a servant moving in answer to the summons.</p> 
<p>The door opened, and Peak was announced.</p> 
<p>Sidwell had never known what it was to be thus overcome with emotion. Shame at her inability to command the calm features with which she would naturally receive a caller flushed her cheeks and neck; she stepped forward with downcast eyes, and only in offering her hand could at length look at him who stood before her. She saw at once that Peak was unlike himself; he too had unusual warmth in his countenance, and his eyes seemed strangely large, luminous. On his forehead were drops of moisture.</p> 
<p>This sight restored her self-control, or such measure of it as permitted her to speak in the conventional way.</p> 
<p>‘I am sorry that mother can’t leave her room. She had a slight cold this morning, but I didn’t think it would give her any trouble.’</p> 
<p>Peak was delighted, and betrayed the feeling even whilst he constrained his face into a look of exaggerated anxiety.</p> 
<p>‘It won’t be anything serious, I hope? The railway journey, I’m afraid.’</p> 
<p>‘Yes, the journey. She has a slight hoarseness, but I think we shall prevent it from’——</p> 
<p>Their eyes kept meeting, and with more steadfastness. They were conscious of mutual scrutiny, and, on both sides, of changes since they last met. When two people have devoted intense study to each other’s features, a three months’ absence not only revives the old impressions but subjects them to sudden modification which engrosses thought and feeling. Sidwell continued to utter commonplaces, simply as a means of disguising the thoughts that occupied her; she was saying to herself that Peak’s face had a purer outline than she had believed, and that his eyes had gained in expressiveness. In the same way Godwin said and replied he knew not what, just to give himself time to observe and enjoy the something new—the increased animation or subtler facial movements—which struck him as often as he looked at his companion. Each wondered what the other had been doing, whether the time had seemed long or short.</p> 
<p>‘I hope you have kept well?’ Sidwell asked.</p> 
<p>Godwin hastened to respond with civil inquiries.</p> 
<p>‘I was very glad to hear from Mr. Warricombe a few days ago, he continued. Sidwell was not aware that her father had written, but her pleased smile seemed to signify the contrary.</p> 
<p>‘She looks younger,’ Peak said in his mind. ‘Perhaps that London dress and the new way of arranging her hair have something to do with it. But no, she looks younger in herself. She must have been enjoying the pleasures of town.’</p> 
<p>‘You have been constantly occupied, no doubt,’ he added aloud, feeling at the same time that this was a clumsy expression of what he meant. Though he had unbuttoned his overcoat, and seated himself as easily as he could, the absurd tall hat which he held embarrassed him; to deposit it on the floor demanded an effort of which he was yet incapable.</p> 
<p>‘I have seen many things and heard much talk,’ Sidwell was replying, in a gay tone. It irritated him; he would have preferred her to speak with more of the old pensiveness. Yet perhaps she was glad simply because she found herself again talking with him?</p> 
<p>‘And you?’ she went on. ‘It has not been all work, I hope?’</p> 
<p>‘Oh no! I have had many pleasant intervals.’</p> 
<p>This was in imitation of her vivacity. He felt the words and the manner to be ridiculous, but could not restrain himself. Every moment increased his uneasiness; the hat weighed in his hands like a lump of lead, and he was convinced that he had never looked so clownish. Did her smile signify criticism of his attitude?</p> 
<p>With a decision which came he knew not how, he let his hat drop to the floor and pushed it aside. There, that was better; he felt less of a bumpkin.</p> 
<p>Sidwell glanced at the glossy grotesque, but instantly averted her eyes, and asked rather more gravely:</p> 
<p>‘Have you been in Exeter all the time?’</p> 
<p>‘Yes.’</p> 
<p>‘But you didn’t spend your Christmas alone, I hope?’</p> 
<p>‘Oh, I had my books.’</p> 
<p>Was there not a touch of natural pathos in this? He hoped so; then mocked at himself for calculating such effects.</p> 
<p>‘I think you don’t care much for ordinary social pleasures, Mr Peak?’</p> 
<p>He smiled bitterly.</p> 
<p>‘I have never known much of them,—and you remember that I look forward to a life in which they will have little part. Such a life,’ he continued, after a pause, ‘seems to you unendurably dull? I noticed that, when I spoke of it before.’</p> 
<p>‘You misunderstood me.’ She said it so undecidedly that he gazed at her with puzzled look. Her eyes fell.</p> 
<p>‘But you like society?’</p> 
<p>‘If you use the word in its narrowest meaning,’ she answered, ‘then I not only dislike society, but despise it.’</p> 
<p>She had raised her eyebrows, and was looking coldly at him. Did she mean to rebuke him for the tone he had adopted? Indeed, he seemed to himself presumptuous. But if they were still on terms such as these, was it not better to know it, even at the cost of humiliation? One moment he believed that he could read Sidwell’s thoughts, and that they were wholly favourable to him; at another he felt absolutely ignorant of all that was passing in her, and disposed to interpret her face as that of a conventional woman who had never regarded him as on her own social plane. These uncertainties, these frequent reversions to a state of mind which at other times he seemed to have long outgrown, were a singular feature of his relations with Sidwell. Could such experiences consist with genuine love? Never had he felt more willing to answer the question with a negative. He felt that he was come here to act a part, and that the end of the interview, be it what it might, would only affect him superficially.</p> 
<p>‘No,’ he replied, with deliberation; ‘I never supposed that you had any interest in the most foolish class of wealthy people. I meant that you recognise your place in a certain social rank, and regard intercourse with your equals as an essential of happiness.’</p> 
<p>‘If I understood why you ask’—she began abruptly, but ceased as she met his glance. Again he thought she was asserting a distant dignity.</p> 
<p>‘The question arose naturally out of a train of thought which always occupies me when I talk with you. I myself belong to no class whatever, and I can’t help wondering how—if the subject ever occurred to you—you would place me.’</p> 
<p>He saw his way now, and, having said thus much, could talk on defiantly. This hour must decide his fortune with Sidwell, yet his tongue utterly refused any of the modes of speech which the situation would have suggested to an ordinary mind. He could not ‘make love’. Instead of humility, he was prompted to display a rough arrogance; instead of tender phrases, he uttered what sounded like deliberate rudeness. His voice was less gently tuned than Sidwell had been wont to hear it. It all meant that he despaired of wooing successfully, and more than half wished to force some word from Sidwell which would spare him the necessity of a plain avowal.</p> 
<p>But before he had finished speaking, her face changed. A light of sudden understanding shone in her eyes; her lips softened to a smile of exquisite gentleness.</p> 
<p>‘The subject never did occur to me,’ she answered. ‘How should it? A friend is a friend.’</p> 
<p>It was not strictly true, but in the strength of her emotion she could forget all that contradicted it.</p> 
<p>‘A friend—yes.’</p> 
<p>Godwin began with the same note of bluntness. But of a sudden he felt the influence of Sidwell’s smile. His voice sank into a murmur, his heart leapt, a thrill went through his veins.</p> 
<p>‘I wish to be something more than a friend.’</p> 
<p>He felt that it was bald, inadequate. Yet the words had come of their own accord, on an impulse of unimpaired sincerity. Sidwell’s head was bent.</p> 
<p>‘That is why I can’t take simple things for granted,’ he continued, his gaze fixed upon her. ‘If I thought of nothing but friendship, it would seem rational enough that you should accept me for what I am—a man of education, talking your own language. Because I have dared to hope something more, I suffer from the thought that I was not born into your world, and that you must be always remembering this difference.’</p> 
<p>‘Do you think me so far behind the age?’ asked Sidwell, trying to laugh.</p> 
<p>‘Classes are getting mixed, confused. Yes, but we are so conscious of the process that we talk of class distinctions more than of anything else,—talk and think of them incessantly. You have never heard me make a profession of Radicalism; I am decidedly behind the age. Be what I may—and I have spiritual pride more than enough—the fact that I have relatives in the lower, even the lowest, social class must necessarily affect the whole course of my life. A certain kind of man declares himself proud of such an origin—and most often lies. Or one may be driven by it into rebellion against social privilege. To me, my origin is simply a grave misfortune, to be accepted and, if possible, overcome. Does that sound mean-spirited? I can’t help it; I want you to know me.’</p> 
<p>‘I believe I know you very well,’ Sidwell replied.</p> 
<p>The consciousness that she was deceived checked the words which were rising to his lips. Again he saw himself in a pitiful light, and this self-contempt reflected upon Sidwell. He could not doubt that she was yielding to him; her attitude and her voice declared it; but what was the value of love won by imposture? Why had she not intelligence enough to see through his hypocrisy, which at times was so thin a veil? How defective must her sympathy be!</p> 
<p>‘Yet you have seen very little of me,’ he said, smiling.</p> 
<p>There was a short silence; then he exclaimed in a voice of emotion:</p> 
<p>‘How I wish we had known each other ever since that day when your brother brought me to your house near Kingsmill! If we had met and talked through all those years! But that was impossible for the very reason which makes me inarticulate now that I wish to say so much. When you first saw me I was a gawky schoolboy, learning to use my brains, and knowing already that life had nothing to offer me but a false position. Whether I remained with my kith and kin, or turned my back upon them in the hope of finding my equals, I was condemned to a life of miserable incompleteness. I was born in exile. It took a long time before I had taught myself how to move and speak like one of the class to which I belonged by right of intellect. I was living alone in London, in mean lodging-houses. But the day came when I felt more confidence in myself. I had saved money, and foresaw that in a year or two I should be able to carry out a plan, make one serious attempt to win a position among educated people.’</p> 
<p>He stopped. Had he intended a full confession, it was thus he might have begun it. Sidwell was regarding him, but with a gentle look, utterly unsuspecting. She was unable to realise his character and his temptations.</p> 
<p>‘And have you not succeeded?’ she asked, in a low voice.</p> 
<p>‘Have I? Let me put it to the test. I will set aside every thought of presumption; forget that I am a penniless student looking forward to a country curacy; and say what I wished to when we had our last conversation. Never mind how it sounds. I have dared to hope that some day I shall ask you to be my wife, and that you won’t refuse.’</p> 
<p>The word ‘wife’ reverberated on his ears. A whirl of emotion broke the defiant calm he had supported for the last few minutes. The silence seemed to be endless; when he looked at Sidwell, her head was bent, the eyes concealed by their drooping lids. Her expression was very grave.</p> 
<p>‘Such a piece of recklessness,’ he said at length, ‘deserves no answer.’</p> 
<p>Sidwell raised her eyes and spoke gently, with voice a little shaken.</p> 
<p>‘Why should you call it recklessness? I have never thought of the things that seem to trouble you so much. You were a friend of ours. Wasn’t that enough?’</p> 
<p>It seemed to him an evasive reply. Doubtless it was much that she showed neither annoyance nor prudish reserve. He had won the right of addressing her on equal terms, but she was not inclined to anticipate that future day to which he pointed.</p> 
<p>‘You have never thought of such things, because you have never thought of me as I of you. Every day of your absence in London has caused me torments which were due most often to the difference between your social position and mine. You have been among people of leisure and refinement and culture. Each evening you have talked with men whom it cost no effort to make themselves liked and respected. I think of that with bitterness.’</p> 
<p>‘But why? I have made many acquaintances; have met very interesting people. I am glad of it; it enables me to understand you better than I could before.’</p> 
<p>‘You are glad on that account?’</p> 
<p>‘Yes; indeed I am.’</p> 
<p>‘Dare I think you mean more than a civil phrase?’</p> 
<p>‘I mean quite simply all that my words imply. I have thought of you, though certainly without bitterness. No one’s conversation in London interested me so much as yours.’</p> 
<p>Soothed with an exquisite joy, Godwin felt his eyes moisten. For a moment he was reconciled to all the world, and forgot the hostilities of a lifetime.</p> 
<p>‘And will it still be so, now, when you go back?’ he asked, in a soft tone.</p> 
<p>‘I am sure it will.’</p> 
<p>‘Then it will be strange if I ever feel bitterly again.’</p> 
<p>Sidwell smiled.</p> 
<p>‘You could have said nothing that could please me more. Why should your life be troubled by these dark moods? I could understand it if you were still struggling with—with doubts, with all manner of uncertainties about your course’——</p> 
<p>She hesitated, watching his face.</p> 
<p>‘You think I have chosen well?’ said Godwin, meeting her look.</p> 
<p>Sidwell’s eyes were at once averted.</p> 
<p>‘I hope,’ she said, ‘we may talk of that again very soon. You have told me much of yourself, but I have said little or nothing of my own—difficulties. It won’t be long before we come back from London, and then’——</p> 
<p>Once more their eyes met steadily.</p> 
<p>‘You think,’ Godwin asked, ‘that I am right in aiming at a life of retirement?’</p> 
<p>‘It is one of my doubts. Your influence would be useful anywhere; but most useful, surely, among people of active mind.’</p> 
<p>‘Perhaps I shan’t be able to choose. Remember that I am seeking for a livelihood as well as for a sphere of usefulness.’</p> 
<p>His eyes fell as he spoke. Hitherto he had had no means of learning whether Sidwell would bring her husband a dowry substantial enough to be considered. Though he could not feel that she had betrothed herself to him, their talk was so nearly that of avowed lovers that perchance she would disclose whatever might help to put his mind at rest. The thought revived his painful self-consciousness; it was that of a schemer, yet would not the curse of poverty have suggested it to any man?</p> 
<p>‘Perhaps you won’t be able to choose—at first,’ Sidwell assented, thereby seeming to answer his unspoken question. ‘But I am sure my father will use whatever influence he has.’</p> 
<p>Had he been seated near enough, he would have been tempted to the boldness of taking her hand. What more encouragement did he await? But the distance between them was enough to check his embarrassed impulses. He could not even call her ‘Sidwell’; it would have been easier a few minutes ago, before she had begun to speak with such calm friendliness. Now, in spite of everything, he felt that to dare such a familiarity must needs call upon him the reproof of astonished eyes.</p> 
<p>‘You return tomorrow?’ he asked, suddenly.</p> 
<p>‘I think so. You have promised me to be cheerful until we are home again.’</p> 
<p>‘A promise to be cheerful wouldn’t mean much. But it does mean much that I can think of what you have said today.’</p> 
<p>Sidwell did not speak, and her silence seemed to compel him to rise. It was strange how remote he still felt from her pure, grave face, and the flowing outlines of her figure. Why could he not say to her, ‘I love you; give me your hands; give me your lips’? Such words seemed impossible. Yet passion thrilled in him as he watched the grace of her movements, the light and shadow upon her features. She had risen and come a step or two forward.</p> 
<p>‘I think you look taller—in that dress.’</p> 
<p>The words rather escaped him than were spoken. His need was to talk of common things, of trifles, that so he might come to feel humanly.</p> 
<p>Sidwell smiled with unmistakable pleasure.</p> 
<p>‘Do I? Do you like the dress?’</p> 
<p>‘Yes. It becomes you.’</p> 
<p>‘Are you critical in such things?’</p> 
<p>‘Not with understanding. But I should like to see you every day in a new and beautiful dress.’</p> 
<p>‘Oh, I couldn’t afford it!’ was the laughing reply.</p> 
<p>He offered his hand; the touch of her warm, soft fingers fired his blood.</p> 
<p>‘Sidwell!’</p> 
<p>It was spoken at last, involuntarily, and he stood with his eyes on hers, her hand crushed in his.</p> 
<p>‘Some day!’ she whispered.</p> 
<p>If their lips met, the contact was so slight as to seem accidental; it was the mere timorous promise of a future kiss. And both were glad of the something that had imposed restraint.</p> 
<p>When Sidwell went up to her mother’s sitting-room, a servant had just brought tea.</p> 
<p>‘I hear that Mr. Peak has been,’ said Mrs. Warricombe, who looked puffy and uncomfortable after her sleep. ‘Emma was going to take tea to the study, but I thought it unnecessary. How could he know that we were here?’</p> 
<p>‘I met him this morning on my way into the town.’</p> 
<p>‘Surely it was rather inconsiderate of him to call.’</p> 
<p>‘He asked if he might.’</p> 
<p>Mrs. Warricombe turned her head and examined Sidwell.</p> 
<p>‘Oh! And did he stay long?’</p> 
<p>‘Not very long,’ replied Sidwell, who was in quiet good-humour.</p> 
<p>‘I think it would have been better if you had told him by the servant that I was not well enough to see callers. You didn’t mention that he might be coming.’</p> 
<p>Mrs. Warricombe’s mind worked slowly at all times, and at present she was suffering from a cold.</p> 
<p>‘Why didn’t you speak of it, Sidwell?’</p> 
<p>‘Really—I forgot,’ replied the daughter, lightly.</p> 
<p>‘And what had he to say?’</p> 
<p>‘Nothing new, mother. Is your head better, dear?’</p> 
<p>There was no answer. Mrs. Warricombe had conceived a vague suspicion which was so alarming that she would not press inquiries alluding to it. The encouragement given by her husband to Godwin Peak in the latter’s social progress had always annoyed her, though she could not frame solid objections. To be sure, to say of a man that he is about to be ordained meets every possible question that society can put; but Mrs. Warricombe’s uneasiness was in part due to personal dislike. Oftener than not, she still thought of Peak as he appeared some eleven years ago—an evident plebeian, without manners, without a redeeming grace. She knew the story of his relative who had opened a shop in Kingsmill; thinking of that now, she shuddered.</p> 
<p>Sidwell began to talk of indifferent matters, and Peak was not again mentioned.</p> 
<p>Her throat being still troublesome, Mrs. Warricombe retired very soon after dinner. About nine o’clock Sidwell went to the library, and sat down at her father’s writing-table, purposing a letter to Sylvia. She penned a line or two, but soon lapsed into reverie, her head on her hands. Of a sudden the door was thrown open, and there stood Buckland, fresh from travel.</p> 
<p>‘What has brought you?’ exclaimed his sister, starting up anxiously, for something in the young man’s look seemed ominous.</p> 
<p>‘Oh, nothing to trouble about. I had to come down—on business. Mother gone to bed?’</p> 
<p>Sidwell explained.</p> 
<p>‘All right; doesn’t matter. I suppose I can sleep here? Let them get me a mouthful of something; cold meat, anything will do.’</p> 
<p>His needs were quickly supplied, and before long he was smoking by the library fire.</p> 
<p>‘I was writing to Sylvia,’ said his sister, glancing at her fragmentary letter.</p> 
<p>‘Oh!’</p> 
<p>‘You know she is at Salisbury?’</p> 
<p>‘Salisbury? No, I didn’t.’</p> 
<p>His carelessness proved to Sidwell that she was wrong in conjecturing that his journey had something to do with Miss Moorhouse. Buckland was in no mood for conversation; he smoked for a quarter of an hour whilst Sidwell resumed her writing.</p> 
<p>‘Of course you haven’t seen Peak?’ fell from him at length.</p> 
<p>His sister looked at him before replying.</p> 
<p>‘Yes. He called this afternoon.’</p> 
<p>‘But who told him you were here?’</p> 
<p>His brows were knitted, and he spoke very abruptly. Sidwell gave the same explanation as to her mother, and had further to reply that she alone received the caller.</p> 
<p>‘I see,’ was Buckland’s comment.</p> 
<p>Its tone troubled Sidwell.</p> 
<p>‘Has your coming anything to do with Mr. Peak?’</p> 
<p>‘Yes, it has. I want to see him the first thing tomorrow.</p> 
<p>‘Can you tell me what about?’</p> 
<p>He searched her face, frowning.</p> 
<p>‘Not now. I’ll tell you in the morning.’</p> 
<p>Sidwell saw herself doomed to a night of suspense. She could not confess how nearly the mystery concerned her. Had Buckland made some discovery that irritated him against Peak? She knew he was disposed to catch at anything that seemed to tell against Godwin’s claims to respectful treatment, and it surely must be a grave affair to hurry him on so long a journey. Though she could imagine no ground of fear, the situation was seriously disturbing.</p> 
<p>She tried to go on with her letter, but failed. As Buckland smoked in silence, she at length rose and said she would go upstairs.</p> 
<p>‘All right! Shall see you at breakfast. Good-night!’</p> 
<p>At nine next morning Mrs. Warricombe sent a message to Buckland that she wished to see him in her bedroom. He entered hurriedly.</p> 
<p>‘Cold better, mother? I have only just time to drink a cup of coffee. I want to catch Peak before he can have left home.’</p> 
<p>‘Mr. Peak? Why? I was going to speak about him.’</p> 
<p>‘What were you going to say?’ Buckland asked, anxiously.</p> 
<p>His mother began in a roundabout way which threatened long detention. In a minute or two Buckland had gathered enough to interrupt her with the direct inquiry:</p> 
<p>‘You don’t mean that there’s anything between him and Sidwell?’</p> 
<p>‘I do hope not; but I can’t imagine why she should—really, almost make a private appointment. I am very uneasy, Buckland. I have hardly slept. Sidwell is rather—you know’——</p> 
<p>‘The deuce! I can’t stop now. Wait an hour or two, and I shall have seen the fellow. You needn’t alarm yourself. He will probably have disappeared in a few days.’</p> 
<p>‘What do you mean?’ Mrs. Warricombe asked, with nervous eagerness.</p> 
<p>‘I’ll explain afterwards.’</p> 
<p>He hurried away. Sidwell was at the breakfast-table. Her eyes seemed to declare that she had not slept well. With an insignificant word or two, the young man swallowed his cup of coffee, and had soon left the house.</p>
