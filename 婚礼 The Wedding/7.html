<p>Of course we’ll be there, one couple said. We wouldn’t miss it for the world, said another. Though the calls were friendly, I didn’t linger on the phone and was finished well before noon.</p> 
<p>Jane and Anna had gone in search of flowers for the bouquets; later in the afternoon, they planned to swing by Noah’s house. With hours to go until we were supposed to meet, I decided to drive to Creekside. On the way, I picked up three loaves of Wonder Bread from the grocery store.</p> 
<p>As I drove, my thoughts drifted to Noah’s house and my first visit there a long time ago.</p> 
<p>Jane and I had been dating for six months before she brought me home to visit.&nbsp; She’d graduated from Meredith in June, and after the ceremony, she rode in my car as we followed her parents back to New Bern. Jane was the oldest of her siblings—only seven years separated the four of them—and I could tell from their faces when we arrived that they were still evaluating me. While I’d stood with Jane’s family at her graduation and Allie had even looped her hand through my arm at one point, I couldn’t help feeling self-conscious about the impression I’d made on them.</p> 
<p>Sensing my anxiety, Jane immediately suggested that we take a walk when we reached the house. The seductive beauty of the low country had a soothing effect on my nerves; the sky was the color of robin’s eggs, and the air held neither the briskness of spring nor the heat and humidity of summer. Noah had planted thousands of bulbs over the years, and lilies bloomed along the fence line in clusters of riotous color. A thousand shades of green graced the trees, and the air was filled with the trills of songbirds. But it was the rose garden, even from a distance, that caught my gaze. The five concentric hearts—the highest bushes in the middle, the lowest on the outside—were bursting in reds, pinks, oranges, whites, and yellows. There was an orchestrated randomness to the blooms, one that suggested a stalemate between man and nature that seemed almost out of place amid the wild beauty of the landscape.&nbsp; In time, we ended up under the trellis adjacent to the garden. Obviously, I’d become quite fond of Jane by then, yet I still wasn’t certain whether we would have a future together. As I’ve mentioned, I considered it a necessity to be gainfully employed before I became involved in a serious relationship. I was still a year away from my own graduation from law school, and it seemed unfair to ask her to wait for me. I didn’t know then, of course, that I would eventually work in New Bern. Indeed, in the coming year, interviews were already set up with firms in Atlanta and Washington, D.C., while she had made plans to move back home.</p> 
<p>Jane, however, had been making my plans difficult to keep. She seemed to enjoy my company. She listened with interest, teased me playfully, and always reached for my hand whenever we were together. The first time she did this, I remember thinking how right it felt. Though it sounds ridiculous, when a couple holds hands, it either feels right or it doesn’t. I suppose this has to do with the intertwining of fingers and the proper placement of the thumb, though when I tried to explain my reasoning to her, Jane laughed and asked me why it was so important to analyze.</p> 
<p>On that day, the day of her graduation, she took my hand again and for the first time told me the story of Allie and Noah. They’d met when they were teenagers and had fallen in love, but Allie had moved away and they didn’t speak for the next fourteen years. While they were separated, Noah worked in New Jersey, headed off to war, and finally returned to New Bern. Allie, meanwhile, became engaged to someone else. On the verge of her wedding, however, she returned to visit Noah and realized it was he whom she’d always loved. In the end, Allie broke off her engagement and stayed in New Bern.&nbsp; Though we’d talked about many things, she’d never told me this. At the time, the story was not as touching to me as it is now, but I suppose this was a function of my age and gender. Yet I could tell the story meant a lot to her, and I was touched by how much she cared for her parents. Soon after she began, her dark eyes were brimming with tears that spilled onto her cheeks. At first she dabbed at them, but then she stopped, as if deciding it didn’t matter whether or not I saw her cry. This implied comfort affected me deeply, for I knew that she was entrusting me with something that she’d shared with few others. I myself have seldom cried at anything, and when she finished, she seemed to understand this about me.</p> 
<p>“I’m sorry about getting so emotional,” she said quietly. “But I’ve been waiting to tell you that story for a long time. I wanted it to be just the right moment, in just the right place.”</p> 
<p>Then she squeezed my hand as though she wanted to hold on to it forever.&nbsp; I glanced away, feeling a tightness in my chest that I’d never before experienced. The scene around me was intensely vivid, every petal and blade of grass standing out in sharp relief. Behind her, I saw her family gathering on the porch. Prisms of sunlight cut patterns on the ground.&nbsp; “Thank you for sharing this with me,” I whispered, and when I turned to face her, I knew what it meant to finally fall in love.</p> 
<p>I went to Creekside and found Noah seated at the pond.</p> 
<p>“Hello, Noah,” I said.</p> 
<p>“Hello, Wilson.” He continued staring out over the water. “Thanks for dropping by.”</p> 
<p>I set the bag of bread on the ground. “You doing okay?”</p> 
<p>“Could be better. Could be worse, though, too.”</p> 
<p>I sat beside him on the bench. The swan in the pond had no fear of me and stayed in the shallows near us.</p> 
<p>“Did you tell her,” he asked, “about having the wedding at the house?”</p> 
<p>I nodded. This had been the idea that I mentioned to Noah the day before.</p> 
<p>“I think she was surprised she hadn’t thought of it first.”</p> 
<p>“She’s got a lot on her mind.”</p> 
<p>“Yes, she does. She and Anna left right after breakfast.”</p> 
<p>“Rarin’ to go?”</p> 
<p>“You could say that. Jane practically dragged Anna out the door. I haven’t heard from her since.”</p> 
<p>“Allie was the same way with Kate’s wedding.”</p> 
<p>He was speaking of Jane’s younger sister. Like the wedding this weekend, Kate’s had been held at Noah’s house. Jane had been the matron of honor.&nbsp; “I suppose she’s already been looking at wedding gowns.”</p> 
<p>I glanced at him, surprised.</p> 
<p>“That was the best part for Allie, I think,” he went on. “She and Kate spent two days in Raleigh searching for the perfect dress. Kate tried on over a hundred of them, and when Allie got home, she described every one of them to me. Lace here, sleeves there, silk and taffeta, cinched waistlines . . . she must have rambled on for hours, but she was so beautiful when she was excited that I barely heard what she was saying.”</p> 
<p>I brought my hands to my lap. “I don’t think she and Anna will have the time for something like that.”</p> 
<p>“No, I don’t suppose they will.” He turned to me. “But she’ll be beautiful no matter what she wears, you know.”</p> 
<p>I nodded.</p> 
<p>These days, the children share in the upkeep of Noah’s house.&nbsp; We own it jointly; Noah and Allie had made those arrangements before they moved to Creekside. Because the house had meant so much to them, and to the children, they simply couldn’t part with it. Nor could they have given it to only one of their children, since it is the site of countless shared memories for all of them.</p> 
<p>As I said, I visited the house frequently, and as I walked the property after leaving Creekside, I made mental notes of all that had to be done. A caretaker kept the grass mowed and the fence in good condition, but a lot of work would be needed to get the property ready for visitors, and there was no way I could do it alone. The white house was coated with the gray dust of a thousand rainstorms, but it was nothing that a good power washing couldn’t spruce up.&nbsp; Despite the caretaker’s efforts, however, the grounds were in bad shape. Weeds were sprouting along the fence posts, hedges needed to be trimmed, and only dried stalks remained of the early-blooming lilies. Hibiscus, hydrangea, and geraniums added splashes of color but needed reshaping as well.&nbsp; While all that could be taken care of relatively quickly, the rose garden worried me. It had grown wild in the years the house had been empty; each concentric heart was roughly the same height, and every bush seemed to grow into the last. Countless stems poked out at odd angles, and the leaves obscured much of the color. I had no idea whether the floodlights still worked. From where I stood, it seemed there was no way it could be salvaged except by pruning everything back and waiting another year for the blooms to return.&nbsp; I hoped my landscaper would be able to work a miracle. If anyone could handle the project, he could. A quiet man with a passion for perfection, Nathan Little had worked on some of the most famous gardens in North Carolina—the Biltmore Estate, the Tryon Place, the Duke Botanical Gardens—and he knew more about plants than anyone I’d ever met.</p> 
<p>My passion for our own garden at home—small, but nonetheless stunning—had led us</p> 
<p>to become friends over the years, and Nathan often made a point of coming by in the hours after work. We had long conversations about acid in the soil and the role of shade for azaleas, differences in fertilizers, and even the watering requirements of pansies. It was something completely removed from the work I did at the office, which is perhaps the reason it gave me such joy.&nbsp; As I surveyed the property, I visualized how I wanted it to look. In the midst of my earlier calls, I’d also contacted Nathan, and though it was Sunday, he’d agreed to swing by. He had three crews, most of whom spoke only Spanish, and the amount of work a single crew could accomplish in a day was staggering. Still, this was a large project, and I prayed they would be able to finish in time.&nbsp; It was as I was making my mental notes that I saw Harvey Wellington, the pastor, in the distance. He was on his front porch, leaning against the post with his arms crossed. He didn’t move when I spotted him. We seemed to be watching each other, and a moment later, I saw him grin. I thought it was an invitation to go see him, but when I glanced away and then back again, he’d vanished inside his home. Even though we’d spoken, even though I’d shaken his hand, I suddenly realized that I’d never set foot beyond his front door.&nbsp; Nathan dropped by after lunch, and we spent an hour together. He nodded continuously as I spoke but kept his questions to a minimum. When I was finished, he shaded his eyes with his hand.</p> 
<p>Only the rose garden will be troublesome, he finally said. It will be much work to make it look the way it should.</p> 
<p>But it’s possible?</p> 
<p>He studied the rose garden for a long moment before nodding. Wednesday and Thursday, he finally said. The entire crew will come, he added. Thirty people.&nbsp; Only two days? I asked. Even with the garden? He knew his business as I know my own, but this statement amazed me nonetheless.</p> 
<p>He smiled and put a hand on my shoulder. “Do not worry, my friend,” he said. “It will be magnificent.”</p> 
<p>By midafternoon, heat was rising from the ground in shimmering waves. The humidity had thickened the air, making the horizon seem out of focus. Feeling the perspiration beading on my brow, I removed a handkerchief from my pocket.&nbsp; After wiping my face, I sat on the porch to wait for Jane and Anna.</p> 
<p>Though the home was boarded up, this hadn’t been done for safety reasons.&nbsp; Rather, the boards were placed over the windows to prevent random vandalism and to keep people from exploring the rooms within. Noah had designed them himself before leaving for Creekside—while his sons had actually done most of the work—and they were attached to the house with hinges and internal hooks so they could be opened easily from the inside. The caretaker did that twice a year to air out the house. The electricity had been turned off, but there was a generator in the rear that the caretaker sometimes turned on to check that the outlets and switches were still in working order. The water had never been turned off because of the sprinkler system, and the caretaker had told me that he sometimes ran the faucets in the kitchen and baths to clean the pipes of any dust that had accumulated.</p> 
<p>One day, I’m sure that someone will move back in. It won’t be Jane and me, nor could I imagine any of the other siblings here, but it seemed inevitable. It was also inevitable that this would happen only long after Noah was gone.&nbsp; A few minutes later, Anna and Jane arrived, dust billowing behind the car as they pulled up the drive. I met them in the shade of a giant oak tree. Both were looking around, and I could see the anxiety mounting on Jane’s face. Anna was chewing gum, and she offered a brief smile.</p> 
<p>“Hi, Daddy,” she said.</p> 
<p>“Hi, sweetheart. How did it go today?” I asked.</p> 
<p>“It was fun. Mom was in a panic, but we finally got it worked out. The bouquet is ordered. and so are the corsages and boutonnieres.” Jane didn’t seem to hear her; she was still glancing around frantically. I knew she was thinking there was no way the property would be ready in time. Because she visits less frequently than I, I think she had retained the image of how this place used to look, not how it looked today.</p> 
<p>I brought a hand to her shoulder. “Do not worry, it will be magnificent,” I reassured her, echoing the promise of the landscaper.&nbsp; Later, Jane and I strolled the grounds together. Anna had wandered off to talk to Keith on her cell phone. As we walked, I related the ideas I had discussed with Nathan, but I could tell her mind was elsewhere.&nbsp; When pressed, Jane shook her head. “It’s Anna,” she confessed with a sigh. “One minute she’s into the plans, and the next minute she isn’t. And she can’t seem to make any decisions on her own. Even with the flowers. She didn’t know what colors she wanted for the bouquets, she didn’t know which varieties. But as soon as I say that I like something, she says that she does, too. It’s driving me crazy. I mean, I know this whole thing is my idea, but still, it’s her wedding.” “She’s always been like that,” I said. “Don’t you remember when she was little?&nbsp; You used to tell me the same thing when the two of you went shopping for school clothes.”</p> 
<p>“I know,” she said, but her tone suggested something else was bothering her.</p> 
<p>“What is it?” I asked.</p> 
<p>“I just wish we had more time.” Jane sighed. “I know we’ve gotten a few things done, but if we had more time, I could arrange for a reception of some sort. As lovely as the ceremony will be, what about afterward? She’ll never have another chance to experience something like this.”</p> 
<p>My wife, the hopeless romantic.</p> 
<p>“Why don’t we have a reception, then?”</p> 
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p> 
<p>“Why don’t we have one here? We’ll just open up the house.” She looked at me as if I’d lost my senses. “For what? We don’t have a caterer, we don’t have tables, we won’t have any music. Those things take time to arrange. It’s not as if you can snap your fingers and have everyone you need come running.”</p> 
<p>“That’s what you said about the photographer, too.”</p> 
<p>“Receptions are different,” she explained with an air of finality.&nbsp; “Then we’ll do it differently,” I persisted. “Maybe we’ll have some of the guests bring food.”</p> 
<p>She blinked. “Pot luck?” She didn’t try to hide her dismay. “You want to have a pot luck dinner for the reception?”</p> 
<p>I felt myself shrink a bit. “It was just an idea,” I mumbled.</p> 
<p>She shook her head and looked off into the distance. “It’s okay,” she said.</p> 
<p>“It’s not a big deal, anyway. It’s the ceremony that matters.”</p> 
<p>“Let me make some calls,” I offered. “Maybe I can arrange something.”</p> 
<p>“There’s not enough time,” she repeated.</p> 
<p>“I do know people who do things like this.”</p> 
<p>This was true. As one of only three estate lawyers in town—and for the early part of my career the only one—it seemed that I knew most of the business owners in the county.</p> 
<p>She hesitated. “I know you do,” she said, but the words sounded like an apology.</p> 
<p>Surprising myself, I reached for her hand.</p> 
<p>“I’ll make some calls,” I said. “Trust me.”</p> 
<p>It might have been the seriousness with which I spoke, or the earnestness of my gaze, but as we stood together, she looked up and seemed to study me. Then, ever so slowly, she squeezed my hand to profess her confidence in me.&nbsp; “Thank you,” she said, and with her hand clutching mine, I felt a strange sensation of déjà vu, as if our years together had suddenly been reversed. And for the briefest moment, I could see Jane standing under the trellis again—I’d just heard the story of her parents, and we were our youthful selves, the future bright and promising before us. Everything was new, as it was so long ago, and when I watched her leave with Anna a minute later, I was suddenly certain that this wedding was the most blessed thing to have happened to us in years.</p>
