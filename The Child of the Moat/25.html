They wondered what had delayed the pursuit, but felt sure it would come.
<br> 
<br> The snow had more or less melted and the day was clear, so that they could see far behind them. When, therefore, they reached a place where they could clearly see two miles and no one following, they slackened pace, so as to give their horses every chance.
<br> 
<br> Ian’s plan was to swim or ford the swollen river at the Weal, the long pool-like stretch, of the Tees,—and then take the track to Garrigill. His present anxiety was to keep Aline warm. He had brought away two big heavy riding cloaks from Andrew, saying that he needed to be warm sleeping on the hills. One of these he had put round Aline, but she was at first very cold. The exercise, however, warmed her a little and they did not dare to stop until they had put the river between them and their pursuers. It was fortunate for them that there was no wind and that the day, although cold, was bright and sunny. The hills looked hard and colourless, but the sunshine seemed to conquer the austerity.
<br> 
<br> They reached the river and negotiated it safely, Ian taking off his boots and lower garments to keep them318 dry. When they reached the other side Aline undressed and put on all of Ian’s clothes that he could take off and they wrung out hers and hung them where they would best dry with the motion through the air.
<br> 
<br> Ian had obtained a sword and two pistols from Andrew, while Aline had the sword with which she swam the moat.
<br> 
<br> They passed through Garrigill without mishap. Ian was particularly nervous of their being caught just as they reached a village, lest a hue and cry should be raised that would stop them. He looked anxiously back when they neared Alston, but no one was in view. It seemed best to make no attempt to keep out of sight by detours, but simply to press on.
<br> 
<br> Their foes, he guessed, would probably get fresh horses in Alston. Oh, if only they had money to do the same! It was impossible to reach Scotland that night, so the best plan seemed to Ian to be to rest their horses at the loneliest part of the road beyond Alston, where they could be concealed themselves and at the same time get a distant view of the road. After a rest they might make a good run for it, as the day was already getting on, particularly if their pursuers cantered their horses from Alston and came up with them at all blown. Then in the dark the best thing would probably be to abandon the horses and escape on foot.
<br> 
<br> They did as he had planned, and after they had rested an hour and a half, during which time the horses had some oats, Ian saw their adversaries about a mile behind. There were six of them and they had been badly delayed getting fresh horses in Alston. They were galloping rather wildly down the hill.
<br> 
<br> 319
<br> 
<br> Ian held his hand for Aline to mount and then vaulted into his seat and they set off at a trot. The others saw them and put spurs to their horses, yelling as they rode.
<br> 
<br> “Keep cool, not too fast,” said Ian, “wait till they come much nearer.”
<br> 
<br> Slowly their pursuers gained upon them, but Aline and Ian reserved their strength.
<br> 
<br> A mile they rode and the interval was lessened by a quarter; their hearts were too full to speak; another mile and the distance was again less by a quarter. Aline looked back: “Oh, Ian! We shall never get away, and they will catch you, too. I wish you had not come to rescue me. Do you think ‘Moll o’ the graves’ really does know anything about what is going to happen?”
<br> 
<br> “No, little heart, but do not be afraid, we have been helped so far. I think we shall get away.”
<br> 
<br> Another mile’s ride and they were only separated from their pursuers by a quarter mile.
<br> 
<br> Ian waited,—three hundred yards,—two hundred,—one hundred,—fifty. “Now,” he said, “let them go,” and both riders lashed their horses and the distance began to lengthen out again till it reached three or four hundred yards. Three of their pursuers fell behind altogether, the mounts they had obtained in Alston were not equal to the strain. One was Father Martin, and it would have made Aline’s ears tingle if she had heard the curses heaped upon her and Ian.
<br> 
<br> The other three kept together for a time and then they also began to spread out a little. At length there were forty paces between the first and second, and a couple of hundred yards to the third.
<br> 
<br> 320
<br> 
<br> It soon became clear, however, that, though they need not fear the third horse, both the other two would ultimately be a match for them, nor would it get dark soon enough for them to escape. Ian kept absolutely cool, but it was a terrible moment. If he were killed, even if Aline did escape, who in the wide world would look after her?
<br> 
<br> When the nearest horse was only about sixty yards behind he said to Aline, “Ride on, I think I can deal with these fellows, but I wish we had more pistols,—two shots will not see us far. Get to Carlisle and find Matthew Musgrave. I doubt not he will smuggle you away over the border; and, if I come not, when Walter Margrove arrives he will somehow provide for you.”
<br> 
<br> “But I won’t leave you,” said Aline. She looked at him so beseechingly, that he knew it was useless to say anything.
<br> 
<br> “Then you must do as I tell you. I am going to stop; you go on thirty or forty paces beyond and then stop also. Be ready to dismount if necessary. You are a good swordswoman, but you know nothing about shooting.”
<br> 
<br> Ian then reined in, turned and pointed his pistol at the leading horse. The man was taken aback by the sudden move, but fired wildly as he rode and the bullet whizzed past Ian’s head. It was only a matter of seconds, but Ian waited to make quite sure and then fired at the horse, which fell and brought its rider with a horrible crash to the ground.
<br> 
<br> The second horse was treated in like manner; but its rider saw what was coming just in time to slacken his pace and leap to the ground as the horse fell. He then321 fired twice, missing the first time, but grazing Ian’s left side with the second shot.
<br> 
<br> He was a big powerful man and before Ian had time to step back and mount, he was in upon him with his sword. Ian had time to draw, but found that the man was no fool with his weapon. Time was precious, too, for the third horseman, who had drawn rein for a moment, was now advancing and would be upon them immediately.
<br> 
<br> Aline, who had seen this, dismounted and shouted: “Leave him to me and load your pistols”; but before she could reach them, Ian’s sword was through the man’s neck.
<br> 
<br> Luckily the horses stood; but he had only time to load one of the pistols, while Aline mounted again, before the third man arrived. He slowed up as he approached and attempted to fire from his horse, but the pistol only flashed in the pan and missed fire. Again Ian brought the horse to the ground, and as the man, who was not seriously hurt, picked himself up, Ian said; “Well, good-bye, my friend, I am sorry that urgent business prevents our waiting,” and springing to his saddle he galloped off.
<br> 
<br> Before the man could fire they were some distance away and the bullet went hopelessly wide.
<br> 
<br> “That’s twice I’ve been shot in three days, little one,” said Ian. “It’s a mercy these fellows cannot shoot better.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, you never told me about the other,” said Aline, “and you must wait now and let me attend to this; the blood is all over your arm and down nearly to your knee.”
<br> 
<br> 322
<br> 
<br> “Indeed, I must not, sweet child, we shall soon have the rest of the gang after us. In fact, I do not know what to do, the horses are completely done and yet it is not safe to put up anywhere. Whatever happens we must not be caught in a town. I believe it would have been safer to have waited and killed them all.”
<br> 
<br> Aline shuddered. “Oh, how awful.”
<br> 
<br> Ian tore a piece off his shirt sleeve and stopped the bleeding of his wound as well as he could, and they rode on in silence for a time, till they came to the place where the road divided for Haltwhistle and Brampton. The trees grew thickly by the stream and it was getting dark. “Let us hide here,” Ian said. “They are unlikely to see us and we can then go whichever way they do not. They cannot be here for some time, so the horses can again get a feed and a rest.”
<br> 
<br> They piled up some dead leaves where two fallen trunks made a sort of shelter, did what they could for Ian’s wound and huddled together and waited.
<br> 
<br> At last, after about two hours, they dimly saw three horses. There was only one rider, but the fugitives guessed that the others carried the dead and the injured man. Four men walked beside them.
<br> 
<br> “I can hardly move another step,” they heard one of them say.
<br> 
<br> “I do not suppose you are as tired as I am,” said a second voice, “besides I bruised myself pretty badly when that devil brought my horse down. I shall be too stiff to move to-morrow.”
<br> 
<br> “Well,” said a third voice, which both recognised as that of Father Martin,—“This kind of game is not in my line anyway. Ride, ride, it is nothing but ride.323 I shall be too sore to sit down for a week; when on earth are you going to bring me to a place for a night’s rest? S’death. I almost feel as though I did not care what happened to the villains, I am so worn out. That’s three of my men dead; for I reckon Philip there will never speak again. Fancy that little she-cat killing Gilbert.”
<br> 
<br> “That’s you, Pussie,” softly whispered Ian in her ear.
<br> 
<br> “Well, this is the way to Haltwhistle; that’s six miles nearer than Brampton,” said one of the other voices, “and they are more likely to have gone there to put us off the track. Anyway, we can get men over to Brampton soon after daylight.”
<br> 
<br> “Thanks for the information,” again whispered Ian.
<br> 
<br> Gradually the voices died away in the still evening air, and finally the sound of the horses’ hoofs also.
<br> 
<br> “Thou art a naughty boy to whisper like that,” said Aline.
<br> 
<br> “Marry, it was safe enough for such a noise as they were making.”
<br> 
<br> They waited a little longer and then Aline put on her own clothes which were now quite dry. She was also going to cut off her hair, but Ian dissuaded her; so she braided it very tightly and concealed it with the bonnet.
<br> 
<br> They walked by their horses for an hour and then mounted and reached Brampton at ten o’clock at night. They approached the small hostelry and dismounted. “Can you give my page and myself supper and a night’s lodging?” Ian enquired. “The horses will want a good rub down, too; they are tired.”
<br> 
<br> 324
<br> 
<br> “Whence have you come and whither bound?” said mine host.
<br> 
<br> “We’ve come from Alston to-day and we’re bound for Scotland to-morrow. But show us a seat and a fire, this is no time for talk.”
<br> 
<br> “Come in, then; but you should not be travelling to Scotland now; there’s trouble on the border again and you may fall in with more than you desired; but it’s none of my business.”
<br> 
<br> At first the place looked empty; but there was a boy curled up on a settle and fast asleep.
<br> 
<br> Ian looked at him and to his surprise it was Wilfred. He hesitated a moment before waking the lad; it seemed unkind, he looked so comfortable; but it might assist toward Aline’s safety. So he lightly touched him on the shoulder. Wilfred looked up and rubbed his eyes. When he saw who it was a look of pleased surprise spread over his face.
<br> 
<br> “What are you doing here, Will?” said Ian.
<br> 
<br> “You said you wanted me to keep a look out for you near Brampton, Master Menstrie; so Matthew and I, finding there was work to be done at Naworth Castle, have come over here. Matthew is lodging at a house near the castle, but as Master Forster, here, is a friend of Matthew’s, I am staying with him. I was to go and help Matthew as soon as we had news of you; but I have spent all my time on the road for some days. He will be so glad to hear you have got back again. We heard in Carlisle that you had been drowned, but I knew you were a great swimmer and felt it could not be true and that you would go on to Holwick as you said. Did you get there?” asked the boy.
<br> 
<br> 325
<br> 
<br> “Yes, I got there all right.”
<br> 
<br> “And what did you do about the little lady?”
<br> 
<br> “The little lady is safe so far,” said Ian, “and Angus, one of the pages from the Hall, is coming with me to see if we can make arrangements for her in Scotland.”
<br> 
<br> “I am glad to hear she is safe.”
<br> 
<br> “The boy, Angus, and I are leaving early to-morrow for Longtown. If those rascals follow us up and you get a chance to delay them, do so. A loose shoe proved very useful before.”
<br> 
<br> William Forster, the innkeeper, brought supper, and Wilfred, who was now thoroughly awake, boylike, was not averse to sharing their meal.
<br> 
<br> “There’s a room prepared for you upstairs,” said Forster. “I suppose your page will be all right on the other settle?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, that will do,” answered Ian. “You do not mind, little one,” he whispered softly after the man had gone. “I think it is best.”
<br> 
<br> “Of course not,” she answered.
<br> 
<br> After the meal they sat by the fire for a few minutes, and Ian looked across at the two boys, as they seemed. Wilfred was immensely better in health and had entirely lost the half starved look. “He’s certainly a beautiful lad,” Ian mused. “They make as fine a pair of boys as Aline and Audry were girls. I must paint those two, just like that, if ever we get safely through. I wish I could sketch them now.”
<br> 
<br> When Ian had retired, Wilfred, who was fascinated by his companion, tried to draw her into conversation; but she was very reticent and pleaded that she wanted to go to sleep, which was indeed true.
<br> 
<br> 326
<br> 
<br> “You have a fine master now,” said Wilfred, “even though he is only a carpenter. He doesn’t look like a man to have a page in those rough home-spuns of his. But you are lucky, going round and serving him. I wish I had the chance. I would die for that man.”
<br> 
<br> “So would I,” said Aline quietly.
<br> 
<br> “Then I’ll love you, too,” said the boy; “but you are right, we must go to sleep.”
<br> 
<br> In the morning Wilfred woke early, while it was still quite dark and roused Angus, as Ian named Aline. “Go you and wake your master,” he said.
<br> 
<br> Aline found Ian and after a meal they took lanthorns out to the stable and prepared to start.
<br> 
<br> Wilfred helped them and chattered away to Aline, trying in every way to lighten her share of the labours.
<br> 
<br> While Ian was settling the score Wilfred took Aline aside: “Remember, Angus,” he said, “that we are both willing to die for him; and if ever I am wanted I am ready. He risked his life for me and I can never repay him.”
<br> 
<br> “Risked his life for you! When? I never heard of it.”
<br> 
<br> Wilfred looked at her. “Do you mean to say he never told you?”
<br> 
<br> “No, he is not the kind that would. Oh, I should like to stay and hear all about it! But I must not wait, Master Menstrie will be wanting me.”
<br> 
<br> “I wish I could tell you everything; but I am so glad that you love him. I am sure that you and I would be great friends,—very great friends; oh, if only I could go with you! But we must say good-bye,” and then Wilfred hesitated, “I am sure I do not know how327 it is,” he said shyly, “I sometimes used to kiss my best friend, Hugh, when there was no one else near; but boys don’t kiss much. However, we two shall never meet again and somehow I want to kiss you.”
<br> 
<br> He approached her a little awkwardly, there were tears in his eyes, and Aline let him kiss her.
<br> 
<br> “Good-bye again, Angus, I shall not forget you,” he said.
<br> 
<br> At that moment Ian returned and they mounted their horses and bade farewell and rode off.
<br> 
<br> The boy stood in the grey dawn, gazing regretfully after them down the road. Then a thought struck him. He felt puzzled. “Why, I do not believe that was a boy at all,—No, I am sure it was not. It must have been the little lady herself. What a fool I was not to think of it before. But fancy her taking a kiss from the likes of me!”
<br> 
<br> They had hardly disappeared from sight, when he heard the clatter of hoofs behind him and a body of armed men rode down the street.
<br> 
<br> “Good morrow, my lad,” said their leader, “you are up betimes.”
<br> 
<br> Wilfred had decided that it would be best to appear very communicative and then perhaps they would not trouble to ask any one else.
<br> 
<br> “Yes,” he said, “there have been some silly loons here, who did not know what a good thing bed is on a cold winter morning, routing me up to look after their horses,” and Wilfred half turned on his heel as though he would go back to the house.
<br> 
<br> “Not so fast, my lad,” said the leader, “who were they, and what were they like?”
<br> 
<br> 328
<br> 
<br> “Oh, there were two of them, a man in homespun and his page, though why he should have a page perplexed me not a little. Do you know who he was, good sirs, I should like to know the meaning of it?”
<br> 
<br> “That is not your concern, lad; come, can you tell me any more? Was he a big man?”
<br> 
<br> “No, he was about middle size; but very well built, with deep set grey eyes and a fine face.”
<br> 
<br> “Humph,” grunted the horseman, “deep set grey eyes, yes; to the devil with the fine face! And what about the other?” he added.
<br> 
<br> “Oh, he was a pretty slip of a boy.”
<br> 
<br> “Were they armed?”
<br> 
<br> “They both had swords and the man had pistols.”
<br> 
<br> “That’s they, right enough; but one more question—Where did they come from and where are they going?”
<br> 
<br> “They came from Alston and arrived very tired last night.”
<br> 
<br> “That settles it, and which way did you say they had gone now?”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, they set off along the Carlisle road, long before it was light. You don’t want to find them, do you? You’ll never do it if you stand talking here; marry, you’ve got your work cut out for you if you want to catch them.”
<br> 
<br> “Come along, men,” said their leader.
<br> 
<br> “They must be pretty well in Carlisle by now,” shouted Wilfred, as they started off. “You will hardly do it.”
<br> 
<br> “To hell fire with them; but we’ll get them yet”; and the horses thundered down the road.
