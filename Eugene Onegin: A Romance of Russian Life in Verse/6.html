 30 “Svetlana,” a short poem by Joukovski, upon which his fame mainly rests. Joukovski was an unblushing plagiarist. Many eminent English poets have been laid under contribution by him, often without going through the form of acknowledging the source of inspiration. Even the poem in question cannot be pronounced entirely original, though its intrinsic beauty is unquestionable. It undoubtedly owes its origin to Burger’s poem “Leonora,” which has found so many English translators. Not content with a single development of Burger’s ghastly production the Russian poet has directly paraphrased “Leonora” under its own title, and also written a poem “Liudmila” in imitation of it. The principal outlines of these three poems are as follows: A maiden loses her lover in the wars; she murmurs at Providence and is vainly reproved for such blasphemy by her mother. Providence at length loses patience and sends her lover’s spirit, to all appearances as if in the flesh, who induces the unfortunate maiden to elope. Instead of riding to a church or bridal chamber the unpleasant bridegroom resorts to the graveyard and repairs to his own grave, from which he has recently issued to execute his errand. It is a repulsive subject. “Svetlana,” however, is more agreeable than its prototype “Leonora,” inasmuch as the whole catastrophe turns out a dream brought on by “sorcery,” during the “sviatki” or Holy Nights (see Canto V. st. x), and the dreamer awakes to hear the tinkling of her lover’s sledge approaching. “Svetlana” has been translated by Sir John Bowring.

<div>
 Quite a sensation; the position
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To all good neighbours’ sport conduced.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Endless conjectures all propound
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And secretly their views expound.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;

<div>

 &nbsp;

<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The wedding-day had been arranged,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But the date subsequently changed

<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of course Tattiana was annoyed
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 By such allusions scandalous,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Yet was her inmost soul o’erjoyed
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With satisfaction marvellous,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As in her heart the thought sank home,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I am in love, my hour hath come!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Thus in the earth the seed expands
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Obedient to warm Spring’s commands.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Long time her young imagination
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 By indolence and languor fired
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The fated nutriment desired;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And long internal agitation
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She waited for — I don’t know whom!

<div>
 &nbsp;

 The fatal hour had come at last —
</div>

 She oped her eyes and cried: ’tis he!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Alas! for now before her passed
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The same warm vision constantly;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Now all things round about repeat
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His name: the tenderness of home
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tiresome unto her hath become
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And the kind-hearted servitors:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Immersed in melancholy thought,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She hears of conversation nought
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And hated casual visitors,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Their coming which no man expects,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And stay whose length none recollects.

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;

 She the delicious novel reads,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With what avidity and zest
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She drinks in those seductive deeds!

 31 The heroes of two romances much in vogue in Pushkin’s time: the former by Madame Cottin, the latter by the famous Madame Krudener. The frequent mention in the course of this poem of romances once enjoying a European celebrity but now consigned to oblivion, will impress the reader with the transitory nature of merely mediocre literary reputation. One has now to search for the very names of most of the popular authors of Pushkin’s day and rummage biographical dictionaries for the dates of their births and deaths. Yet the poet’s prime was but fifty years ago, and had he lived to a ripe old age he would have been amongst us still. He was four years younger than the late Mr. Thomas Carlyle. The decadence of Richardson’s popularity amongst his countrymen is a fact familiar to all.

 Her passion’s faithful counterpart,

<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.

<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 On raptures, sorrows not her own,

<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She murmurs in an undertone
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A letter for her hero meant:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 That hero, though his merit shone,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Was certainly no Grandison.

<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And shall adopt some new caprice.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Thus having braved Apollo’s rage
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With humble prose I’ll fill my page
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And a romance in ancient style
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Shall my declining years beguile;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Nor shall my pen paint terribly
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The torment born of crime unseen,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But shall depict the touching scene
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of Russian domesticity;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I will descant on love’s sweet dream,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The olden time shall be my theme.
</div> 
<div>

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Old people’s simple conversations
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 My unpretending page shall fill,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Their offspring’s innocent flirtations
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 By the old lime-tree or the rill,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Their Jealousy and separation
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And tears of reconciliation:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Fresh cause of quarrel then I’ll find,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But finally in wedlock bind.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The passionate speeches I’ll repeat,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Accents of rapture or despair
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I uttered to my lady fair
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Then they came easily enow,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 My tongue is somewhat rusty now.
</div> 
<div>

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 What bitter tears with thee I shed!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Thou hast resigned thy destiny
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Thou’lt suffer, dearest, but before,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Hope with her fascinating power
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To dire contentment shall give birth
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Thou’lt quaff love’s sweet envenomed stream,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Fantastic images shall swarm
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In thy imagination warm,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of happy meetings thou shalt dream,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And wheresoe’er thy footsteps err,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Confront thy fated torturer!

 Love’s pangs Tattiana agonize.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She seeks the garden in her need —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And cares not farther to proceed;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Barely to draw her breath she seems,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And now ’tis night, the guardian moon
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Sails her allotted course on high,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And from the misty woodland nigh
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The nightingale trills forth her tune;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And thus unto her nurse did say:
</div> 
<div>
 XVII
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “Nurse, ’tis so close I cannot rest.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Open the window — sit by me.”
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “What ails thee, dear?”—“I feel depressed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Relate some ancient history.”
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “But which, my dear? — In days of yore
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Within my memory I bore
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Many an ancient legend which
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In monsters and fair dames was rich;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But now my mind is desolate,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 What once I knew is clean forgot —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Alas! how wretched now my lot!”
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “But tell me, nurse, can you relate
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The days which to your youth belong?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Were you in love when you were young?”—
</div> 
<div>
 XVIII
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “Alack! Tattiana,” she replied,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “We never loved in days of old,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 My mother-inlaw who lately died34
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Had killed me had the like been told.”
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “How came you then to wed a man?”—
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “Why, as God ordered! My Ivan
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Was younger than myself, my light,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 For I myself was thirteen quite;35
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Her suit before my parents pressing:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 At last my father gave his blessing,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And bitter tears of fright I shed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Weeping they loosed my tresses long36
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And led me off to church with song.”
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div>

 34 A young married couple amongst Russian peasants reside in the house of the bridegroom’s father till the “tiaglo,” or family circle is broken up by his death.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 35 Marriages amongst Russian serfs used formerly to take place at ridiculously early ages. Haxthausen asserts that strong hearty peasant women were to be seen at work in the fields with their infant husbands in their arms. The inducement lay in the fact that the “tiaglo” (see previous note) received an additional lot of the communal land for every male added to its number, though this could have formed an inducement in the southern and fertile provinces of Russia only, as it is believed that agriculture in the north is so unremunerative that land has often to be forced upon the peasants, in order that the taxes, for which the whole Commune is responsible to Government, may be paid. The abuse of early marriages was regulated by Tsar Nicholas.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 36 Courtships were not unfrequently carried on in the larger villages, which alone could support such an individual, by means of a “svakha,” or matchmaker. In Russia unmarried girls wear their hair in a single long plait or tail, “kossa;” the married women, on the other hand, in two, which are twisted into the head-gear.

<div>
 &nbsp;

<div>
 “Then amongst strangers I was left —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But I perceive thou dost not heed —”
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “Alas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Mortally sick I am indeed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Behold, my sobs I scarce restrain —”
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “My darling child, thou art in pain. —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The Lord deliver her and save!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tell me at once what wilt thou have?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I’ll sprinkle thee with holy water. —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 How thy hands burn!”—“Dear nurse, I’m well.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I am — in love — you know — don’t tell!”
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “The Lord be with thee, O my daughter!”—
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And the old nurse a brief prayer said
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And crossed with trembling hand the maid.

 “I am in love,” her whispers tell
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The aged woman in her woe:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “My heart’s delight, thou art not well.”—
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “I am in love, nurse! leave me now.”
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Behold! the moon was shining bright
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And showed with an uncertain light
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tattiana’s beauty, pale with care,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Her tears and her dishevelled hair;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And on the footstool sitting down
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Beside our youthful heroine fair,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A kerchief round her silver hair
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The aged nurse in ample gown,37
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Whilst all creation seemed to dream
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Enchanted by the moon’s pale beam.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;

 37 It is thus that I am compelled to render a female garment not known, so far as I am aware, to Western Europe. It is called by the natives “doushegreika,” that is to say, “warmer of the soul”— in French, chaufferette de l’ame. It is a species of thick pelisse worn over the “sarafan,” or gown.

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But borne in spirit far away
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tattiana gazes on the moon,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And starting suddenly doth say:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “Nurse, leave me. I would be alone.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Pen, paper bring: the table too
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Draw near. I soon to sleep shall go —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Good-night.” Behold! she is alone!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 ’Tis silent — on her shines the moon —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Upon her elbow she reclines,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And Eugene ever in her soul
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Indites an inconsiderate scroll
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Wherein love innocently pines.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Now it is ready to be sent —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?
</div> 
<div>
 XXII
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I have known beauties cold and raw
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As Winter in their purity,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Striking the intellect with awe
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 By dull insensibility,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And I admired their common sense
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And natural benevolence,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But, I acknowledge, from them fled;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 For on their brows I trembling read
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The inscription o’er the gates of Hell
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “Abandon hope for ever here!”38
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Love to inspire doth woe appear
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To such — delightful to repel.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Perchance upon the Neva e’en
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Similar dames ye may have seen.

<div>
 Amid submissive herds of men
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Virgins miraculous I see,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Who selfishly unmoved remain
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Alike by sighs and flattery.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But what astonished do I find
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When harsh demeanour hath consigned
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A timid love to banishment? —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 On fresh allurements they are bent,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 At least by show of sympathy;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 At least their accents and their words
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Appear attuned to softer chords;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And then with blind credulity
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The youthful lover once again
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Pursues phantasmagoria vain.

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed? —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Because in singleness of thought
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She never of deception dreamed
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But trusted the ideal she wrought? —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Because her passion wanted art,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Obeyed the impulses of heart? —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Because she was so innocent,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 That Heaven her character had blent
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With an imagination wild,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With intellect and strong volition
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And a determined disposition,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 An ardent heart and yet so mild? —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Doth love’s incautiousness in her
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 So irremissible appear?
</div> 
<div>
 XXV
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 O ye whom tender love hath pained
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Without the ken of parents both,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Whose hearts responsive have remained
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To the impressions of our youth,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The all-entrancing joys of love —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Young ladies, if ye ever strove
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The mystic lines to tear away
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A lover’s letter might convey,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Or into bold hands anxiously
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Have e’er a precious tress consigned,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Or even, silent and resigned,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When separation’s hour drew nigh,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Have felt love’s agitated kiss
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With tears, confused emotions, bliss —

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With unanimity complete,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Condemn not weak Tattiana mine;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Do not cold-bloodedly repeat
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The sneers of critics superfine;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And you, O maids immaculate,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 E’en as the presence of a snake,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I the same admonition make.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Who knows? with love’s consuming flame
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Perchance you also soon may burn,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Then to some gallant in your turn
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The triumph of a conquest new.

 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The God of Love is after you!

<div>
 A coquette loves by calculation,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tattiana’s love was quite sincere,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A love which knew no limitation,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Even as the love of children dear.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She did not think “procrastination
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Enhances love in estimation
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And thus secures the prey we seek.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His vanity first let us pique

 Incessantly his chains to break.”

 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The letter which Tattiana wrote.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 At Russ she was by no means clever
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And read our newspapers scarce ever,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And in her native language she
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 So she in French herself expressed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I cannot help it I declare,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Though hitherto a lady ne’er
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In Russ her love made manifest,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And never hath our language proud
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In correspondence been allowed.39

 39 It is well known that until the reign of the late Tsar French was the language of the Russian court and of Russian fashionable society. It should be borne in mind that at the time this poem was written literary warfare more or less open was being waged between two hostile schools of Russian men of letters. These consisted of the Arzamass, or French school, to which Pushkin himself together with his uncle Vassili Pushkin the “Nestor of the Arzamass” belonged, and their opponents who devoted themselves to the cultivation of the vernacular.

</div> 
<div>
 To whom ye for unnumbered crimes
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Had to compose in secret rhymes,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To whom your hearts were consecrate —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Did they not all the Russian tongue
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With little knowledge and that wrong
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In charming fashion mutilate?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Did not their lips with foreign speech
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The native Russian tongue impeach?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div>

 40 The “Blago–Namierenni,” or “Well–Wisher,” was an inferior Russian newspaper of the day, much scoffed at by contemporaries. The editor once excused himself for some gross error by pleading that he had been “on the loose.”

</div> 
<div>
 I promised! — Did I so? — Well, there!

 Now I am ready to refuse.

 41 Hippolyte Bogdanovitch — b. 1743, d. 1803 — though possessing considerable poetical talent was like many other Russian authors more remarkable for successful imitation than for original genius. His most remarkable production is “Doushenka,” “The Darling,” a composition somewhat in the style of La Fontaine’s “Psyche.” Its merit consists in graceful phraseology, and a strong pervading sense of humour.

 42 Parny — a French poet of the era of the first Napoleon, b. 1753, d. 1814. Introduced to the aged Voltaire during his last visit to Paris, the patriarch laid his hands upon the youth’s head and exclaimed: “Mon cher Tibulle.” He is chiefly known for his erotic poetry which attracted the affectionate regard of the youthful Pushkin when a student at the Lyceum. We regret to add that, having accepted a pension from Napoleon, Parny forthwith proceeded to damage his literary reputation by inditing an “epic” poem entitled “Goddam! Goddam! par un French — Dog.” It is descriptive of the approaching conquest of Britain by Napoleon, and treats the embryo enterprise as if already conducted to a successful conclusion and become matter of history. A good account of the bard and his creations will be found in the Saturday Review of the 2d August 1879.

 Tattiana’s letter I possess,

 I guard it as a holy thing,

 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And though I read it with distress,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I’m o’er it ever pondering.

<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Inspired by whom this tenderness,

<div>
 &nbsp;

<div>
 This gentle daring who could guess?

 Who this soft nonsense could impart,

 Imprudent prattle of the heart,

 Tattiana’s Letter to Oneguine
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I write to you! Is more required?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Can lower depths beyond remain?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 ’Tis in your power now, if desired,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To crush me with a just disdain.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But if my lot unfortunate
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 You in the least commiserate
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 You will not all abandon me.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 At first, I clung to secrecy:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Believe me, of my present shame
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 You never would have heard the name,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 If the fond hope I could have fanned
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 At times, if only once a week,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To see you by our fireside stand,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To listen to the words you speak,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Address to you one single phrase
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And then to meditate for days
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of one thing till again we met.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 ’Tis said you are a misanthrope,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In country solitude you mope,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And we — an unattractive set —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Can hearty welcome give alone.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Why did you visit our poor place?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Forgotten in the village lone,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I never should have seen your face
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And bitter torment never known.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The untutored spirit’s pangs calmed down
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 By time (who can anticipate?)
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I had found my predestinate,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Become a faithful wife and e’en
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A fond and careful mother been.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Another! to none other I
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 My heart’s allegiance can resign,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 My doom has been pronounced on high,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 ’Tis Heaven’s will and I am thine.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The sum of my existence gone
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But promise of our meeting gave,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I feel thou wast by God sent down
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 My guardian angel to the grave.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Thou didst to me in dreams appear,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Unseen thou wast already dear.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Thine eye subdued me with strange glance,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I heard thy voice’s resonance
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Long ago. Dream it cannot be!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Scarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I flushed up, stupefied I grew,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And cried within myself: ’tis he!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Is it not truth? in tones suppressed
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With thee I conversed when I bore
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Comfort and succour to the poor,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To ease the anguish of my breast.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Nay! even as this instant fled,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Was it not thou, O vision bright,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 That glimmered through the radiant night
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And gently hovered o’er my head?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Was it not thou who thus didst stoop
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To whisper comfort, love and hope?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Or torturer malevolent?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Doubt and uncertainty decide:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 All this may be an empty dream,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Delusions of a mind untried,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Providence otherwise may deem —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Then be it so! My destiny
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 From henceforth I confide to thee!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Lo! at thy feet my tears I pour
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And thy protection I implore.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Imagine! Here alone am I!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 No one my anguish comprehends,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 At times my reason almost bends,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And silently I here must die —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But I await thee: scarce alive
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 My heart with but one look revive;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Or to disturb my dreams approach
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Alas! with merited reproach.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 ’Tis finished. Horrible to read!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With shame I shudder and with dread —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But boldly I myself resign:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Thine honour is my countersign!

 Tattiana moans and now she sighs
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And in her grasp the letter shakes,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Even the rosy wafer dries
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Upon her tongue which fever bakes.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Her head upon her breast declines
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And an enchanting shoulder shines
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 From her half-open vest of night.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But lo! already the moon’s light
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Is waning. Yonder valley deep
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Looms gray behind the mist and morn
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Silvers the brook; the shepherd’s horn
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Arouses rustics from their sleep.

 Nor on the letter yet hath she

 The image of her seal impressed.

<div>
 “Then send your grandson quietly
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To take this letter to O— Well!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Unto our neighbour. Mind you tell —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Command him not to say a word —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I mean my name not to repeat.”
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “To whom is it to go, my sweet?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of late I have been quite absurd —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 So many neighbours here exist —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Am I to go through the whole list?”
</div> 
<div>

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “How dull you are this morning, nurse!”
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “My darling, growing old am I!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In age the memory gets worse,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But I was sharp in times gone by.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In times gone by thy bare command —”
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “Oh! nurse, nurse, you don’t understand!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 What is thy cleverness to me?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The letter is the thing, you see —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Oneguine’s letter!”—“Ah! the thing!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Now don’t be cross with me, my soul,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 You know that I am now a fool —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But why are your cheeks whitening?”
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “Nothing, good nurse, there’s nothing wrong,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But send your grandson before long.”
</div> 
<div>

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 No answer all that day was borne.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Another passed; ’twas just the same.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tattiana waits. No answer came!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Olga’s admirer came that day:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “Tell me, why doth your comrade stay?”
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The hostess doth interrogate:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “He hath neglected us of late.”—
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quick —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “He promised here this day to ride,”
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Lenski unto the dame replied,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “The post hath kept him, it is like.”
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As if he cruelly had joked!
</div> 
<div>
 XXXIX
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 ’Twas dusk! Upon the table bright
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Shrill sang the samovar at eve,44
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The china teapot too ye might
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In clouds of steam above perceive.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Into the cups already sped
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 By Olga’s hand distributed
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And a boy handed round the cream.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tania doth by the casement linger
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And breathes upon the chilly glass,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And traces with a slender finger
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Upon its damp opacity,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The mystic monogram, O. E.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 44 The samovar, i.e. “self-boiler,” is merely an urn for hot water having a fire in the center. We may observe a similar contrivance in our own old-fashioned tea-urns which are provided with a receptacle for a red-hot iron cylinder in center. The tea-pot is usually placed on the top of the samovar.

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In the meantime her spirit sinks,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Her weary eyes are filled with tears —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A horse’s hoofs she hears — She shrinks!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Nearer they come — Eugene appears!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Ah! than a spectre from the dead
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 More swift the room Tattiana fled,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 From hall to yard and garden flies,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Not daring to cast back her eyes.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She fears and like an arrow rushes
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The bridge and alley to the lake,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Brambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Till out of breath upon a seat
</div> 
<div>
 XLI
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She sank. —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 ?“He’s here! Eugene is here!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Merciful God, what will he deem?”
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Yet still her heart, which torments tear,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Guards fondly hope’s uncertain dream.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She waits, on fire her trembling frame —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Will he pursue? — But no one came.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She heard of servant-maids the note,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Singing in chorus all the while.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 (This by command; for it was found,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 However cherries might abound,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They disappeared by stealth and guile,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 So mouths they stopt with song, not fruit —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Device of rural minds acute!)
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The Maidens’ Song
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Young maidens, fair maidens,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Friends and companions,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Disport yourselves, maidens,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Arouse yourselves, fair ones.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Come sing we in chorus
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The secrets of maidens.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Allure the young gallant
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With dance and with song.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As we lure the young gallant,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Espy him approaching,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Disperse yourselves, darlings,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And pelt him with cherries,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With cherries, red currants,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With raspberries, cherries.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Approach not to hearken
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To secrets of virgins,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Approach not to gaze at
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The frolics of maidens.
</div> 
<div>
 XLII
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They sang, whilst negligently seated,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Attentive to the echoing sound,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tattiana with impatience waited
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Until her heart less high should bound —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Till the fire in her cheek decreased;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But tremor still her frame possessed,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Nor did her blushes fade away,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 More crimson every moment they.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With iridescent wing doth flap
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When captured in a schoolboy’s cap;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She from the winter corn espies
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A sportsman who in covert lies.
</div> 
<div>
 XLIII
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But finally she heaves a sigh,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And rising from her bench proceeds;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But scarce had turned the corner nigh,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Which to the neighbouring alley leads,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When Eugene like a ghost did rise
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Before her straight with roguish eyes.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tattiana faltered, and became
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But this adventure’s consequence
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To-day, my friends, at any rate,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I am not strong enough to state;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I, after so much eloquence,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Must take a walk and rest a bit —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Some day I’ll somehow finish it.
