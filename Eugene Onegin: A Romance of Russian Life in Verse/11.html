 ‘Fare thee well, and if for ever,

 Still for ever fare thee well.’— Byron

<div>
 I
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In the Lyceum’s noiseless shade
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As in a garden when I grew,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I Apuleius gladly read
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But would not look at Cicero.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 ’Twas then in valleys lone, remote,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In spring-time, heard the cygnet’s note
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 By waters shining tranquilly,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 That first the Muse appeared to me.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Into the study of the boy
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 There came a sudden flash of light,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The Muse revealed her first delight,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Sang childhood’s pastimes and its joy,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Glory with which our history teems
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And the heart’s agitated dreams.
</div> 
<div>
 II
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And the world met her smilingly,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A first success light pinions gave,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The old Derjavine noticed me,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And blest me, sinking to the grave.78
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Then my companions young with pleasure
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In the unfettered hours of leisure
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Her utterances ever heard,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And by a partial temper stirred
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And boiling o’er with friendly heat,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They first of all my brow did wreathe
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And an encouragement did breathe
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 O triumphs of my guileless days,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 How sweet a dream your memories raise!
</div> 
<div>

 78 This touching scene produced a lasting impression on Pushkin’s mind. It took place at a public examination at the Lyceum, on which occasion the boy poet produced a poem. The incident recalls the “Mon cher Tibulle” of Voltaire and the youthful Parny (see Note 42). Derjavine flourished during the reigns of Catherine the Second and Alexander the First. His poems are stiff and formal in style and are not much thought of by contemporary Russians. But a century back a very infinitesimal endowment of literary ability was sufficient to secure imperial reward and protection, owing to the backward state of the empire. Stanza II properly concludes with this line, the remainder having been expunged either by the author himself or the censors. I have filled up the void with lines from a fragment left by the author having reference to this canto.

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Passion’s wild sway I then allowed,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Her promptings unto law did make,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Pursuits I followed of the crowd,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 My sportive Muse I used to take
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To many a noisy feast and fight,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Terror of guardians of the night;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And wild festivities among
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She brought with her the gift of song.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Like a Bacchante in her sport
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And the young revellers of past times
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Vociferously paid her court,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And I, amid the friendly crowd,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of my light paramour was proud.
</div> 
<div>

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But I abandoned their array,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And fled afar — she followed me.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 How oft the kindly Muse away
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Hath whiled the road’s monotony,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Entranced me by some mystic tale.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Like Leonora did she ride79
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With me Caucasian rocks beside!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 How oft to the Crimean shore
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She led me through nocturnal mist
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Unto the sounding sea to list,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Where Nereids murmur evermore,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And where the billows hoarsely raise
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To God eternal hymns of praise.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div>

 Then, the far capital forgot,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Its splendour and its blandishments,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She visited the humble tents
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of migratory gipsy hordes —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And wild among them grew her words —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Our godlike tongue she could exchange
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 For savage speech, uncouth and strange,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And ditties of the steppe she loved.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But suddenly all changed around!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Lo! in my garden was she found
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And as a country damsel roved,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A pensive sorrow in her glance
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And in her hand a French romance.

 Lead into good society,

<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With jealous fear, anxiety.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Through dense aristocratic rows
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of diplomats and warlike beaux
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And supercilious dames she glides,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Sits down and gazes on all sides —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Amazed at the confusing crowd,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Variety of speech and vests,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Deliberate approach of guests
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And the dark fringe of men, like frames
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Enclosing pictures of fair dames.

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;

<div>
 With clouded brow stands silently?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Unknown to all he doth appear,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A vision desolate and drear
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Doth seem to him the festal scene.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Doth his brow wretchedness declare
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Or suffering pride? Why is he there?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Who may he be? Is it Eugene?

 The twenty-sixth year of his age,

 81 The “Demon,” a short poem by Pushkin which at its first appearance created some excitement in Russian society. A more appropriate, or at any rate explanatory title, would have been the Tempter. It is descriptive of the first manifestation of doubt and cynicism in his youthful mind, allegorically as the visits of a “demon.” Russian society was moved to embody this imaginary demon in the person of a certain friend of Pushkin’s. This must not be confounded with Lermontoff’s poem bearing the same title upon which Rubinstein’s new opera, “Il Demonio,” is founded.

</div> 
<div>
 A wish from place to place to roam,

<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A very troublesome disease,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In some a willing martyrdom.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Abandoned he his country seat,

 A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div>

<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But still remembrance to him clings,

<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His travels like all other things
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Inspired but weariness intense;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Returning, from his ship amid
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A ball he fell as Tchatzki did.82
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div>

 82 Tchatzki, one of the principal characters in Griboyedoff’s celebrated comedy “Woe from Wit” (Gore ot Ouma).

<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Behold, the crowd begins to stir,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A whisper runs along the hall,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A lady draws the hostess near,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Behind her a grave general.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Her manners were deliberate,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Reserved, but not inanimate,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Her eyes no saucy glance address,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 There was no angling for success.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Her features no grimaces bleared;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of affectation innocent,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Calm and without embarrassment,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A faithful model she appeared
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of “comme il faut.” Shishkoff, forgive!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I can’t translate the adjective.83
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 83 Shishkoff was a member of the literary school which cultivated the vernacular as opposed to the Arzamass or Gallic school, to which the poet himself and his uncle Vassili Pushkin belonged. He was admiral, author, and minister of education.

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Ladies in crowds around her close,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Her with a smile old women greet,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The men salute with lower bows
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And watch her eye’s full glance to meet.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Maidens before her meekly move
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Along the hall, and high above
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The general who accompanies.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 None could her beautiful declare,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Yet viewing her from head to foot,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 None could a trace of that impute,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Which in the elevated sphere
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of London life is “vulgar” called
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.

 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I like this word exceedingly
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Although it will not bear translation,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With us ’tis quite a novelty
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Not high in general estimation;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 ‘Twould serve ye in an epigram —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But turn we once more to our dame.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Enchanting, but unwittingly,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 At table she was sitting by
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The brilliant Nina Voronskoi,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The Neva’s Cleopatra, and
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 None the conviction could withstand
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 That Nina’s marble symmetry,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Though dazzling its effulgence white,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Could not eclipse her neighbour’s light.
</div> 
<div>

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “And is it,” meditates Eugene.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “And is it she? It must be — no —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 How! from the waste of steppes unseen,”—
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And the eternal lorgnette through
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Frequent and rapid doth his glance
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Seek the forgotten countenance
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Familiar to him long ago.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “Inform me, prince, pray dost thou know
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The lady in the crimson cap
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Who with the Spanish envoy speaks?”—
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The prince’s eye Oneguine seeks:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “Ah! long the world hath missed thy shape!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But stop! I will present thee, if
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 You choose.”—“But who is she?”—“My wife.”
</div> 
<div>
 XVIII
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “So thou art wed! I did not know.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Long ago?”—”’Tis the second year.”
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “To —?”—“Larina.”—“Tattiana?”—“So.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And dost thou know her?”—“We live near.”
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “Then come with me.” The prince proceeds,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His wife approaches, with him leads
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His relative and friend as well.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The lady’s glance upon him fell —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And though her soul might be confused,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And vehemently though amazed
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She on the apparition gazed,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 No signs of trouble her accused,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A mien unaltered she preserved,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Her bow was easy, unreserved.
</div> 
<div>
 XIX
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Ah no! no faintness her attacked
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Nor sudden turned she red or white,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Her brow she did not e’en contract
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Though he surveyed her at his ease,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Not the least trace Oneguine sees
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of the Tattiana of times fled.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He conversation would have led —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But could not. Then she questioned him:—
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “Had he been long here, and where from?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Straight from their province had he come?”—
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Cast upwards then her eyeballs dim
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Unto her husband, went away —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Transfixed Oneguine mine doth stay.
</div> 
<div>
 XX
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Is this the same Tattiana, say,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Before whom once in solitude,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In the beginning of this lay,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Deep in the distant province rude,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Impelled by zeal for moral worth,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He salutary rules poured forth?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The maid whose note he still possessed
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Where all upon the surface lies —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 That girl — but he must dreaming be —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 That girl whom once on a time he
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Could in a humble sphere despise,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Can she have been a moment gone
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Thus haughty, careless in her tone?
</div> 
<div>
 XXI
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He quits the fashionable throng
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And meditative homeward goes,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Visions, now sad, now grateful, long
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Do agitate his late repose.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He wakes — they with a letter come —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The Princess N. will be at home
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 On such a day. O Heavens, ’tis she!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Oh! I accept. And instantly
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He a polite reply doth scrawl.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In the recesses what hath stirred
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of a heart cold and cynical?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Vexation? Vanity? or strove
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Again the plague of boyhood — love?
</div> 
<div>
 XXII
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The hours once more Oneguine counts,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Impatient waits the close of day,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But ten strikes and his sledge he mounts
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And gallops to her house away.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Trembling he seeks the young princess —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tattiana finds in loneliness.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Together moments one or two
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They sat, but conversation’s flow
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Deserted Eugene. He, distraught,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Sits by her gloomily, desponds,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Scarce to her questions he responds,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Full of exasperating thought.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He fixedly upon her stares —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She calm and unconcerned appears.
</div> 
<div>
 XXIII
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The husband comes and interferes
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With this unpleasant tete-a-tete,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With Eugene pranks of former years
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And jests doth recapitulate.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The conversation was revived
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 By the coarse wit of worldly hate;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But round the hostess scintillate
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Light sallies without coxcombry,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Awhile sound conversation seems
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To banish far unworthy themes
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And platitudes and pedantry,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And never was the ear affright
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 By liberties or loose or light.
</div> 
<div>
 XXIV
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And yet the city’s flower was there,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Noblesse and models of the mode,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Faces which we meet everywhere
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And necessary fools allowed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Behold the dames who once were fine
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With roses, caps and looks malign;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Some marriageable maids behold,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Blank, unapproachable and cold.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Lo, the ambassador who speaks
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Economy political,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And with gray hair ambrosial
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The old man who has had his freaks,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Renowned for his acumen, wit,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But now ridiculous a bit.
</div> 
<div>

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Behold Sabouroff, whom the age
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 For baseness of the spirit scorns,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Saint Priest, who every album’s page
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With blunted pencil-point adorns.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Another tribune of the ball
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Hung like a print against the wall,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Pink as Palm Sunday cherubim,84
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Motionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The traveller, bird of passage he,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Awakens secret merriment
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 By his embarrassed dignity —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Mute glances interchanged aside
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Meet punishment for him provide.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 84 On Palm Sunday the Russians carry branches, or used to do so. These branches were adorned with little painted pictures of cherubs with the ruddy complexions of tradition. Hence the comparison.
</div>

 XXVI
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But my Oneguine the whole eve
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Within his mind Tattiana bore,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Not the young timid maid, believe,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Enamoured, simple-minded, poor,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But the indifferent princess,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Divinity without access
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of the imperial Neva’s shore.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 O Men, how very like ye are
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To Eve the universal mother,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Possession hath no power to please,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The serpent to unlawful trees
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Aye bids ye in some way or other —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Unless forbidden fruit we eat,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Our paradise is no more sweet.
</div> 
<div>

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 How thoroughly her part she took!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 How soon to habits she conformed
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Which crushing dignity must brook!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Who would the maiden innocent
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In the unmoved, magnificent
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Autocrat of the drawing-room seek?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And he had made her heart beat quick!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 ’Twas he whom, amid nightly shades,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She mourned and to the moon would raise
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The languid eye of love-sick maids,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Dreaming perchance in weal or woe
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To end with him her path below.
</div>

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To Love all ages lowly bend,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But the young unpolluted heart
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His gusts should fertilize, amend,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As vernal storms the fields athwart.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Youth freshens beneath Passion’s showers,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Develops and matures its powers,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And thus in season the rich field
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But at a later, sterile age,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The solstice of our earthly years,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Mournful Love’s deadly trace appears
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As storms which in chill autumn rage
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And leave a marsh the fertile ground
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And devastate the woods around.
</div>

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tattiana loved as when a lad,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Both day and night he now must pass
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In love-lorn meditation sad.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Careless of every social rule,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The crystals of her vestibule
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He daily in his drives drew near
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And like a shadow haunted her.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Enraptured was he if allowed
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 If his hot hand encountered hers,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Or he dispersed the motley crowd
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.
</div> 
<div>
 XXX
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She seemed of him oblivious,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Despite the anguish of his breast,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Received him freely at her house,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 At times three words to him addressed
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In company, or simply bowed,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Or recognized not in the crowd.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 No coquetry was there, I vouch —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Society endures not such!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Oneguine’s cheek grew ashy pale,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Either she saw not or ignored;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Oneguine wasted; on my word,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Already he grew phthisical.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 All to the doctors Eugene send,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And they the waters recommend.
</div> 
<div>
 XXXI
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He went not — sooner was prepared
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To write his forefathers to warn
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of his approach; but nothing cared
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tattiana — thus the sex is born. —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He obstinately will remain,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Still hopes, endeavours, though in vain.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Sickness more courage doth command
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Than health, so with a trembling hand
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A love epistle he doth scrawl.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Though correspondence as a rule
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He used to hate — and was no fool —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Yet suffering emotional
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Had rendered him an invalid;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But word for word his letter read.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Oneguine’s Letter to Tattiana
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 All is foreseen. My secret drear
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Will sound an insult in your ear.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 What acrimonious scorn I trace
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Depicted on your haughty face!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 What do I ask? What cause assigned
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 That I to you reveal my mind?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To what malicious merriment,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 It may be, I yield nutriment!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Meeting you in times past by chance,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Warmth I imagined in your glance,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But, knowing not the actual truth,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Restrained the impulses of youth;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Also my wretched liberty
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I would not part with finally;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 This separated us as well —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Lenski, unhappy victim, fell,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 From everything the heart held dear
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I then resolved my heart to tear;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Unknown to all, without a tie,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I thought — retirement, liberty,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Will happiness replace. My God!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 How I have erred and felt the rod!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 No, ever to behold your face,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To follow you in every place,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Your smiling lips, your beaming eyes,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To watch with lovers’ ecstasies,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Long listen, comprehend the whole
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of your perfections in my soul,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Before you agonized to die —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 This, this were true felicity!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But such is not for me. I brood
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Daily of love in solitude.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 My days of life approach their end,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Yet I in idleness expend
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The remnant destiny concedes,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And thus each stubbornly proceeds.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I feel, allotted is my span;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But, that life longer may remain,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 At morn I must assuredly
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Know that thy face that day I see.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I tremble lest my humble prayer
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 You with stern countenance declare
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The artifice of villany —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I hear your harsh, reproachful cry.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 If ye but knew how dreadful ’tis
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To bear love’s parching agonies —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To burn, yet reason keep awake
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The fever of the blood to slake —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A passionate desire to bend
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And, sobbing at your feet, to blend
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Entreaties, woes and prayers, confess
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 All that the heart would fain express —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Yet with a feigned frigidity
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To arm the tongue and e’en the eye,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To be in conversation clear
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And happy unto you appear.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 So be it! But internal strife
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I cannot longer wage concealed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The die is cast! Thine is my life!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Into thy hands my fate I yield!
</div> 
<div>

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 No answer! He another sent.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Epistle second, note the third,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Remained unnoticed. Once he went
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To an assembly — she appeared
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Just as he entered. How severe!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She will not see, she will not hear.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Alas! she is as hard, behold,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Oh, how her lips compressed restrain
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The indignation of her heart!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Upon her brow sits wrath alone —
</div> 
<div>
 XXXIII
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And it may be a secret dread
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Lest the world or her lord divine
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A certain little escapade
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Well known unto Oneguine mine.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 ’Tis hopeless! Homeward doth he flee
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Cursing his own stupidity,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And brooding o’er the ills he bore,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Society renounced once more.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Then in the silent cabinet
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He in imagination saw
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The time when Melancholy’s claw
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 ‘Mid worldly pleasures chased him yet,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Caught him and by the collar took
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And shut him in a lonely nook.
</div> 
<div>
 XXXIV
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He read as vainly as before,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Manzoni, Herder and Chamfort,85

<div>
 &nbsp;
</div>

 Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:

<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He read the unbelieving Bayle,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Also the works of Fontenelle,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Some Russian authors he perused —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Nought in the universe refused:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Which lessons unto us repeat,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Wherein I castigation get;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And where a madrigal occurs
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Writ in my honour now and then —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 E sempre bene, gentlemen!

 85 Owing to the unstable nature of fame the names of some of the above literary worthies necessitate reference at this period in the nineteenth century.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Johann Gottfried von Herder, b. 1744, d. 1803, a German philosopher, philanthropist and author, was the personal friend of Goethe and held the poet of court chaplain at Weimar. His chief work is entitled, “Ideas for a Philosophy of the History of Mankind,” in 4 vols.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Sebastien Roch Nicholas Chamfort, b. 1741, d. 1794, was a French novelist and dramatist of the Revolution, who contrary to his real wishes became entangled in its meshes. He exercised a considerable influence over certain of its leaders, notably Mirabeau and Sieyes. He is said to have originated the title of the celebrated tract from the pen of the latter. “What is the Tiers Etat? Nothing. What ought it to be? Everything.” He ultimately experienced the common destiny in those days, was thrown into prison and though shortly afterwards released, his incarceration had such an effect upon his mind that he committed suicide.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Marie Francois Xavier Bichat, b. 1771, d. 1802, a French anatomist and physiologist of eminence. His principal works are a “Traite des Membranes,” “Anatomie generale appliquee a la Physiologie et a la Medecine,” and “Recherches Physiologiques sur la Vie et la Mort.” He died at an early age from constant exposure to noxious exhalations during his researches.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Pierre Francois Tissot, b. 1768, d. 1864, a French writer of the Revolution and Empire. In 1812 he was appointed by Napoleon editor of the Gazette de France. He wrote histories of the Revolution, of Napoleon and of France. He was likewise a poet and author of a work entitled “Les trois Irlandais Conjures, ou l’ombre d’Emmet,” and is believed to have edited Foy’s “History of the Peninsular War.”

 The above catalogue by its heterogeneous composition gives a fair idea of the intellectual movement in Russia from the Empress Catherine the Second downwards. It is characterized by a feverish thirst for encyclopaedic knowledge without a corresponding power of assimilation.

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But what results? His eyes peruse
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But thoughts meander far away —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Ideas, desires and woes confuse
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His intellect in close array.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 On lines invisible are fixt;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 ’Twas these he read and these alone
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His spirit was intent upon.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They were the wonderful traditions
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of kindly, dim antiquity,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Dreams with no continuity,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Prophecies, threats and apparitions,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The lively trash of stories long
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Or letters of a maiden young.
</div> 
<div>
 XXXVI
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And by degrees upon him grew
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A lethargy of sense, a trance,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And soon imagination threw
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Before him her wild game of chance.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And now upon the snow in thaw
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A young man motionless he saw,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As one who bivouacs afield,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And heard a voice cry — Why! He’s killed! —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And now he views forgotten foes,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Poltroons and men of slanderous tongue,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Bevies of treacherous maidens young;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of thankless friends the circle rose,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A mansion — by the window, see!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She sits alone —’tis ever she!
</div> 
<div>
 XXXVII
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 So frequently his mind would stray
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Almost became a poet say —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Oh! what had been his eminence!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Indeed, by force of magnetism
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A Russian poem’s mechanism
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 My scholar without aptitude
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 At this time almost understood.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 How like a poet was my chum
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When, sitting by his fire alone
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Whilst cheerily the embers shone,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He “Benedetta” used to hum,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Or “Idol mio,” and in the grate
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Would lose his slippers or gazette.

 XXXVIII
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Time flies! a genial air abroad,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Winter resigned her empire white,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Oneguine ne’er as poet showed
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Nor died nor lost his senses quite.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His chambers close wherein confined
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He marmot-like did hibernate,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His double sashes and his grate,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And sallied forth one brilliant morn —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Along the Neva’s bank he sleighs,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 On the blue blocks of ice the rays
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of the sun glisten; muddy, worn,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The snow upon the streets doth melt —
</div> 
<div>

 Whither along them doth he pelt?

</div> 
<div>
 Oneguine whither gallops? Ye
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Have guessed already. Yes, quite so!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Unto his own Tattiana he,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Incorrigible rogue, doth go.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Her house he enters, ghastly white,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The vestibule finds empty quite —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He enters the saloon. ’Tis blank!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A door he opens. But why shrank
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He back as from a sudden blow? —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Alone the princess sitteth there,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Pallid and with dishevelled hair,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Gazing upon a note below.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Her tears flow plentifully and
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Her cheek reclines upon her hand.
</div> 
<div>

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Oh! who her speechless agonies
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Could not in that brief moment guess!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Who now could fail to recognize
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tattiana in the young princess!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Eugene fell prostrate at her feet —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She starts, nor doth a word express,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But gazes on Oneguine’s face
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Without amaze or wrath displayed:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His sunken eye and aspect faint,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Imploring looks and mute complaint
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She comprehends. The simple maid
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 By fond illusions once possest
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Is once again made manifest.
</div> 
<div>
 XLI
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His kneeling posture he retains —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Calmly her eyes encounter his —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Insensible her hand remains
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Beneath his lips’ devouring kiss.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 What visions then her fancy thronged —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A breathless silence then, prolonged —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But finally she softly said:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “Enough, arise! for much we need
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Without disguise ourselves explain.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Oneguine, hast forgotten yet
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The hour when — Fate so willed — we met
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In the lone garden and the lane?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 How meekly then I heard you preach —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To-day it is my turn to teach.
</div> 
<div>

 “Oneguine, I was younger then,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And better, if I judge aright;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I loved you — what did I obtain?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;

 Affection how did you requite?
</div>

</div>

 But with austerity! — for you

<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 No novelty — is it not true? —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Was the meek love a maiden feels.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But now — my very blood congeals,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Calling to mind your icy look
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And sermon — but in that dread hour
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I blame not your behaviour —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 An honourable course ye took,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Displayed a noble rectitude —
</div> 
<div>

<div>
 My soul is filled with gratitude!

 I did not please you. Why pursue

 Me now, inflict upon me pain? —

 &nbsp;
</div>

 Wherefore am I your quarry held? —

 Is it that I am now compelled

<div>
 To move in fashionable life,

<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 That I am rich, a prince’s wife? —

 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Because my lord, in battles maimed,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Is petted by the Emperor? —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div>

 That my dishonour would ensure

<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A notoriety proclaimed,

<div>

 And in society might shed

 A bastard fame prohibited?

 Indifferent was her future fate.

 For ever your Tattiana leave.

 Stood as if struck by lightning fire.

 Raged round him and of balked desire!

 Glittered in a perspective long,

 Some are afar and some are dead.

 Without them Eugene is complete;

 And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;

</div> 
<div>
 Ah! what hath fate not torn away!

 Happy who quit life’s banquet seat

 Before the dregs they shall divine

 But who abandon it — as I

<div>
 Have my Oneguine — suddenly.

 86 The celebrated Persian poet. Pushkin uses the passage referred to as an epigraph to the “Fountain of Baktchiserai.” It runs thus: “Many, even as I, visited that fountain, but some of these are dead and some have journeyed afar.” Saadi was born in 1189 at Shiraz and was a reputed descendant from Ali, Mahomet’s son-inlaw. In his youth he was a soldier, was taken prisoner by the Crusaders and forced to work in the ditches of Tripoli, whence he was ransomed by a merchant whose daughter he subsequently married. He did not commence writing till an advanced age. His principal work is the “Gulistan,” or “Rose Garden,” a work which has been translated into almost every European tongue.
