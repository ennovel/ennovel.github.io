 ‘La Morale est dans la nature des choses.’— Necker
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 [Mikhailovskoe, 1825]
</div> 
<div>
 I
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 THE less we love a lady fair
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The easier ’tis to gain her grace,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And the more surely we ensnare
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Her in the pitfalls which we place.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Time was when cold seduction strove
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To swagger as the art of love,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Everywhere trumpeting its feats,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Not seeking love but sensual sweets.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But this amusement delicate
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Was worthy of that old baboon,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Our fathers used to dote upon;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The Lovelaces are out of date,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Their glory with their heels of red
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And long perukes hath vanished.
</div> 
<div>
 II
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 For who imposture can endure,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A constant harping on one tune,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Serious endeavours to assure
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 What everybody long has known;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Ever to hear the same replies
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And overcome antipathies
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Which never have existed, e’en
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In little maidens of thirteen?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And what like menaces fatigues,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Entreaties, oaths, fictitious fear,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Epistles of six sheets or near,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And husbands’ tedious amity?
</div> 
<div>
 III
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Such were the musings of Eugene.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He in the early years of life
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Had a deluded victim been
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of error and the passions’ strife.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 By daily life deteriorated,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Awhile this beauty captivated,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And that no longer could inspire.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Slowly exhausted by desire,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Yet satiated with success,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In solitude or worldly din,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He heard his soul’s complaint within,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With laughter smothered weariness:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And thus he spent eight years of time,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Destroyed the blossom of his prime.
</div> 
<div>
 IV
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Though beauty he no more adored,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He still made love in a queer way;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Rebuffed — as quickly reassured,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Jilted — glad of a holiday.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Without enthusiasm he met
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The fair, nor parted with regret,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Thus a guest with composure will
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To take a hand at whist oft come:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He takes his seat, concludes his game,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And straight returning whence he came,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tranquilly goes to sleep at home,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And in the morning doth not know
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Whither that evening he will go.
</div> 
<div>
 V
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 However, Tania’s letter reading,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Eugene was touched with sympathy;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The language of her girlish pleading
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Aroused in him sweet reverie.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He called to mind Tattiana’s grace,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Pallid and melancholy face,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And in a vision, sinless, bright,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His spirit sank with strange delight.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 May be the empire of the sense,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Regained authority awhile,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But he desired not to beguile
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Such open-hearted innocence.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But to the garden once again
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Wherein we lately left the twain.
</div> 
<div>
 VI
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Two minutes they in silence spent,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Oneguine then approached and said:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “You have a letter to me sent.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Do not excuse yourself. I read
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Confessions which a trusting heart
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 May well in innocence impart.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Charming is your sincerity,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Feelings which long had ceased to be
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 It wakens in my breast again.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But I came not to adulate:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Your frankness I shall compensate
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 By an avowal just as plain.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 An ear to my confession lend;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To thy decree my will I bend.
</div> 
<div>
 VII
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “If the domestic hearth could bless —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 My sum of happiness contained;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 If wife and children to possess
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A happy destiny ordained:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 If in the scenes of home I might
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 E’en for an instant find delight,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Then, I say truly, none but thee
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I would desire my bride to be —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I say without poetic phrase,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Found the ideal of my youth,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Thee only would I choose, in truth,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As partner of my mournful days,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And be as happy — as I might.
</div> 
<div>
 VIII
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “But strange am I to happiness;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 ’Tis foreign to my cast of thought;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Me your perfections would not bless;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I am not worthy them in aught;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And honestly ’tis my belief
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Our union would produce but grief.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Though now my love might be intense,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Habit would bring indifference.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I see you weep. Those tears of yours
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tend not my heart to mitigate,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But merely to exasperate;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Judge then what roses would be ours,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 What pleasures Hymen would prepare
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 For us, may be for many a year.
</div> 
<div>

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “What can be drearier than the house,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Wherein the miserable wife
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Deplores a most unworthy spouse
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And leads a solitary life?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The tiresome man, her value knowing,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Yet curses on his fate bestowing,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Is full of frigid jealousy,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Such am I. This did ye expect,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When in simplicity ye wrote
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Your innocent and charming note
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With so much warmth and intellect?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Hath fate apportioned unto thee
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 This lot in life with stern decree?
</div> 
<div>
 X
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “Ideas and time ne’er backward move;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 My soul I cannot renovate —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I love you with a brother’s love,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Perchance one more affectionate.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Listen to me without disdain.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A maid hath oft, may yet again
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 replace the visions fancy drew;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As in their turn the seasons roll.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 ’Tis evidently Heaven’s will
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 You fall in love again. But still —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Learn to possess more self-control.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Not all will like myself proceed —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And thoughtlessness to woe might lead.”
</div> 
<div>
 XI
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Thus did our friend Oneguine preach:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Attentive listened to his speech,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 All breathless and without replies.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His arm he offers. Mute and sad
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 (Mechanically, let us add),
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tattiana doth accept his aid;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And, hanging down her head, the maid
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Around the garden homeward hies.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Together they returned, nor word
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of censure for the same incurred;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The country hath its liberties
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And privileges nice allowed,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Even as Moscow, city proud.
</div> 
<div>
 XII
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Confess, O ye who this peruse,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Oneguine acted very well
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 By poor Tattiana in the blues;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 ’Twas not the first time, I can tell
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 You, he a noble mind disclosed,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Though some men, evilly disposed,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Spared him not their asperities.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His friends and also enemies
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 (One and the same thing it may be)
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Esteemed him much as the world goes.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Yes! every one must have his foes,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But Lord! from friends deliver me!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The deuce take friends, my friends, amends
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I’ve had to make for having friends!
</div> 
<div>
 XIII
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Dark, unavailing reverie,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I just hint, in parenthesis,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 There is no stupid calumny
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Born of a babbler in a loft
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And by the world repeated oft,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 There is no fishmarket retort
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And no ridiculous report,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Which your true friend with a sweet smile
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Where fashionable circles meet
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A hundred times will not repeat,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Quite inadvertently meanwhile;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And yet he in your cause would strive
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And loves you as — a relative!
</div> 
<div>
 XIV
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Are all your relatives quite well?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Permit me; is it worth the trouble
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 For your instruction here to tell
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 What I by relatives conceive?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 These are your relatives, believe:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Those whom we ought to love, caress,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With spiritual tenderness;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Whom, as the custom is of men,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 We visit about Christmas Day,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Or by a card our homage pay,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 That until Christmas comes again
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They may forget that we exist.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And so — God bless them, if He list.

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In this the love of the fair sex
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Beats that of friends and relatives:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In love, although its tempests vex,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Our liberty at least survives:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The natural fickleness of passion,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The torrent of opinion,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And the fair sex as light as down!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Besides the hobbies of a spouse
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Should be respected throughout life
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 By every proper-minded wife,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And this the faithful one allows,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When in as instant she is lost —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Satan will jest, and at love’s cost.
</div> 
<div>
 XVI
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Where is he who doth not deceive?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Who words and actions will adjust
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To standards in which we believe?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Oh! who is not calumnious?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Who labours hard to humour us?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To whom are our misfortunes grief
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And who is not a tiresome thief?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 My venerated reader, oh!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Cease the pursuit of shadows vain,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Spare yourself unavailing pain
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And all your love on self bestow;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A worthy object ’tis, and well
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I know there’s none more amiable.
</div> 
<div>

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But from the interview what flowed?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Alas! It is not hard to guess.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The insensate fire of love still glowed
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Nor discontinued to distress
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tattiana more than ever burned
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With hopeless passion: from her bed
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Her health, life’s sweetness and its bloom,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Her smile and maidenly repose,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 All vanished as an echo goes.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Across her youth a shade had come,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As when the tempest’s veil is drawn
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Across the smiling face of dawn.
</div> 
<div>
 XVIII
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Alas! Tattiana fades away,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Listless is she the livelong day
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Nor interest in aught betrays.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Shaking with serious air the head,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In whispers low the neighbours said:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 ’Tis time she to the altar went!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But enough! Now, ’tis my intent
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The imagination to enliven
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With love which happiness extends;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Against my inclination, friends,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 By sympathy I have been driven.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Forgive me! Such the love I bear
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 My heroine, Tattiana dear.

<div>
 Vladimir, hourly more a slave
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To youthful Olga’s beauty bright,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Into delicious bondage gave
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His ardent soul with full delight.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Always together, eventide
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Found them in darkness side by side,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 At morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Around the meadow and the grove.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And what resulted? Drunk with love,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But with confused and bashful air,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Lenski at intervals would dare,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 If Olga smilingly approve,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Dally with a dishevelled tress
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Or kiss the border of her dress.
</div> 
<div>

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To Olga frequently he would
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Some nice instructive novel read,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Whose author nature understood
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Better than Chateaubriand did
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Yet sometimes pages two or three
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 (Nonsense and pure absurdity,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 For maiden’s hearing deemed unfit),
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He somewhat blushing would omit:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Far from the rest the pair would creep
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And (elbows on the table) they
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A game of chess would often play,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Buried in meditation deep,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Till absently Vladimir took
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With his own pawn alas! his rook!
</div>

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Homeward returning, he at home
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Is occupied with Olga fair,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He leisurely adorns for her.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Landscapes thereon he would design,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A tombstone, Aphrodite’s shrine,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Or, with a pen and colours fit,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A dove which on a lyre doth sit;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The “in memoriam” pages sought,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Where many another hand had signed
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A tender couplet he combined,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A register of fleeting thought,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A flimsy trace of musings past
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Which might for many ages last.
</div> 
<div>
 XXII
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Surely ye all have overhauled
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A country damsel’s album trim,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Which all her darling friends have scrawled
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 From first to last page to the rim.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Behold! orthography despising,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Metreless verses recognizing
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 By friendship how they were abused,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Upon the opening page ye find:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Qu’ecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Subscribed, toujours a vous, Annette;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And on the last one, underlined:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Who in thy love finds more delight
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Beyond this may attempt to write.
</div> 
<div>
 XXIII
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Infallibly you there will find
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Two hearts, a torch, of flowers a wreath,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And vows will probably be signed:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Affectionately yours till death.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Some army poet therein may
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In such an album with delight
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I would, my friends, inscriptions write,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 My verses, kindly meant, would earn
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Delighted glances in return;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 That afterwards with evil smile
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They would not solemnly debate
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 If cleverly or not I prate.

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But, O ye tomes without compare,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Which from the devil’s bookcase start,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Albums magnificent which scare
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The fashionable rhymester’s heart!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Yea! although rendered beauteous
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 By Tolstoy’s pencil marvellous,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Though Baratynski verses penned,45
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The thunderbolt on you descend!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Whene’er a brilliant courtly dame
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Presents her quarto amiably,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Despair and anger seize on me,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And a malicious epigram
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Trembles upon my lips from spite —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And madrigals I’m asked to write!

<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But Lenski madrigals ne’er wrote
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In Olga’s album, youthful maid,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To purest love he tuned his note
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Nor frigid adulation paid.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 What never was remarked or heard
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of Olga he in song averred;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Both natural and truthful seemed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Thus thou, Yazykoff, dost arise46
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In amorous flights when so inspired,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Singing God knows what maid admired,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And all thy precious elegies,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Sometime collected, shall relate
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The story of thy life and fate.

 Since Fame and Freedom he adored,

 Incited by his stormy Muse
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But Olga would not such peruse.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When poets lachrymose recite
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Their own productions, some insist

<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 No greater pleasure can exist
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div>

 Just so! that modest swain is blest

<div>

<div>
 Who reads his visionary theme
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To the fair object of his dream,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A beauty languidly at rest,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Yes, happy — though she at his side
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 By other thoughts be occupied.

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But I the products of my Muse,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Consisting of harmonious lays,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To my old nurse alone peruse,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Companion of my childhood’s days.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Or, after dinner’s dull repast,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I by the button-hole seize fast
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 My neighbour, who by chance drew near,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And breathe a drama in his ear.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Or else (I deal not here in jokes),
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I sail upon my lake at times
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And terrify a swarm of ducks,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Who, heard the music of my lay,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Take to their wings and fly away.
</div> 
<div>

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But to Oneguine! A propos!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His daily occupations, lo!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Minutely I will now portray.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A hermit’s life Oneguine led,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 At seven in summer rose from bed,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And clad in airy costume took
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His course unto the running brook.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 There, aping Gulnare’s bard, he spanned
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His Hellespont from bank to bank,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And then a cup of coffee drank,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Some wretched journal in his hand;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Then dressed himself . . . (*)
</div>

</div>

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The uncontaminated kiss
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A dinner, whimsical each course,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A bottle of a vintage white
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And solitude and calm delight.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Such was Oneguine’s sainted life,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And such unconsciously he led,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Nor marked how summer’s prime had fled
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In aimless ease and far from strife,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The curse of commonplace delight.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And town and friends forgotten quite.

 XXX
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 This northern summer of our own,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 On winters of the south a skit,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Glimmers and dies. This is well known,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Though we will not acknowledge it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Already Autumn chilled the sky,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The tiny sun shone less on high
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And shorter had the days become.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The forests in mysterious gloom
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Were stripped with melancholy sound,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Upon the earth a mist did lie
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And many a caravan on high
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A weary season was at hand —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 November at the gate did stand.
</div> 
<div>
 XXXI
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The morn arises foggy, cold,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The silent fields no peasant nears,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The wolf upon the highways bold
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With his ferocious mate appears.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Detecting him the passing horse
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 snorts, and his rider bends his course
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And wisely gallops to the hill.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 No more at dawn the shepherd will
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Drive out the cattle from their shed,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Nor at the hour of noon with sound
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of horn in circle call them round.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Singing inside her hut the maid
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.
</div> 
<div>
 XXXII
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Already crisp hoar frosts impose
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 O’er all a sheet of silvery dust
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 (Readers expect the rhyme of rose,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 There! take it quickly, if ye must).
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Behold! than polished floor more nice
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The shining river clothed in ice;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A joyous troop of little boys
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Engrave the ice with strident noise.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Thinking to float upon the stream,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Descends the bank with care extreme,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The first bright wreathing storm of snow
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Which falls in starry flakes below.
</div> 
<div>
 XXXIII
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 How in the country pass this time?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Walking? The landscape tires the eye
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In winter by its blank and dim
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And naked uniformity.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 On horseback gallop o’er the steppe!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His footing on the treacherous rime
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And may fall headlong any time.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Alone beneath your rooftree stay
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And read De Pradt or Walter Scott!47
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Keep your accounts! You’d rather not?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Then get mad drunk or wroth; the day
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Will pass; the same tomorrow try —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 You’ll spend your winter famously!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div>

 47 The Abbe de Pradt: b. 1759, d. 1837. A political pamphleteer of the French Revolution: was at first an emigre, but made his peace with Napoleon and was appointed Archbishop of Malines.

</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A true Childe Harold my Eugene
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To idle musing was a prey;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 At morn an icy bath within
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He sat, and then the livelong day,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Alone within his habitation
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And buried deep in meditation,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He round the billiard-table stalked,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When evening o’er the landscape looms,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A table to the fire is brought,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Driving abreast three horses gray.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “Bring dinner now without delay!”
</div> 
<div>
 XXXV
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Upon the table in a trice
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of widow Clicquot or Moet
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 For the young poet they display.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Its ebullition foaming white
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 (Like other things I could relate)
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 My heart of old would captivate.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The last poor obol I was worth —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Was it not so? — for thee I gave,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And thy inebriating wave
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Full many a foolish prank brought forth;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And oh! what verses, what delights,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Delicious visions, jests and fights!
</div> 
<div>
 XXXVI
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Alas! my stomach it betrays
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With its exhilarating flow,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And I confess that now-a-days
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To cope with Ay no more I dare,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 For Ay is like a mistress fair,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Seductive, animated, bright,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But wilful, frivolous, and light.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Who in the agony of grief
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Is ever ready with relief,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Assistance ever will extend,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Or quietly partake our woe.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!
</div> 
<div>
 XXXVII
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The golden ember now enshrines,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And barely visible the smoke
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Upward in a thin stream inclines.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But little warmth the fireplace lends,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The goblet still is bubbling bright —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Outside descend the mists of night.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 How pleasantly the evening jogs
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When o’er a glass with friends we prate
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Just at the hour we designate
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The time between the wolf and dogs —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I cannot tell on what pretence —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But lo! the friends to chat commence.
</div> 
<div>
 XXXVIII
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “How are our neighbours fair, pray tell,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tattiana, saucy Olga thine?”
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “The family are all quite well —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Give me just half a glass of wine —
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They sent their compliments — but oh!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 How charming Olga’s shoulders grow!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Her figure perfect grows with time!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She is an angel! We sometime
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Must visit them. Come! you must own,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 My friend, ’tis but to pay a debt,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 For twice you came to them and yet
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 You never since your nose have shown.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But stay! A dolt am I who speak!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They have invited you this week.”
</div> 
<div>
 XXXIX
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “Me?”—“Yes! It is Tattiana’s fete
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Next Saturday. The Larina
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Told me to ask you. Ere that date
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Make up your mind to go there.”—“Ah!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 It will be by a mob beset
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of every sort and every set!”
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “Not in the least, assured am I!”
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 “Who will be there?”—“The family.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Do me a favour and appear.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Will you?”—“Agreed.”—“I thank you, friend,”
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And saying this Vladimir drained
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His cup unto his maiden dear.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Then touching Olga they depart
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!
</div> 
<div>
 XL
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He was most gay. The happy date
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In three weeks would arrive for them;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The secrets of the marriage state
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And love’s delicious diadem
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With rapturous longing he awaits,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Nor in his dreams anticipates
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Hymen’s embarrassments, distress,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And freezing fits of weariness.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In life domestic see a string
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of pictures painful harrowing,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A novel in Lafontaine’s style,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 My wretched Lenski’s fate I mourn,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He seemed for matrimony born.
</div> 
<div>
 XLI
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He was beloved: or say at least,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He thought so, and existence charmed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The credulous indeed are blest,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And he who, jealousy disarmed,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In sensual sweets his soul doth steep
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Or, parable more flattering,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As butterflies to blossoms cling.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But wretched who anticipates,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Whose brain no fond illusions daze,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Who every gesture, every phrase
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In true interpretation hates:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Whose heart experience icy made
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And yet oblivion forbade.
