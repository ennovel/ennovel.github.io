<br> 
<br> It was all very well to feel confident of a victory for the Blue when you were back there in Yardley with the Yardley cheers ringing in your ears, but it was rather more difficult now, when almost every person waved a Broadwood flag or wore a knot of green and when one was literally within the enemy’s camp. This was the thought that came to Gerald as he followed his father and Harry while they worked their way through the crowd about the tiny grand-stand and finally[292] found seats on that structure. Accommodations there were at a premium, for the stand afforded the only shade about the diamond and was so small that only Faculty members, parents, friends, and students accompanying them were admitted. The rest of the spectators lined the field behind the ropes stretched along the first and third base lines, or perched themselves upon the roof and in the windows of the laboratory building which stood nearby. Broadwood’s field adjoined the campus, and from the stand one could look down a long slope of meadow and farm land for almost a mile.
<br> 
<br> Gerald confided his doubts to Harry when they had finally squeezed themselves into their seats high up under the sloping roof, but Harry had of a sudden changed from a pessimist to an optimist regarding Yardley’s chances.
<br> 
<br> “Don’t you worry,” he replied excitedly. “We’ll trim ’em for fair. Here comes Yardley now!”
<br> 
<br> The blue-stockinged team, some twenty strong, came trotting down from the gymnasium, pushed through the crowd about the ropes, hurdled over or ducked under them, and went to their bench at the right of the plate. The bench, with its little strip of gay awning above, was in full view of the stand and Gerald and Harry amused themselves[293] with comments on the appearances of the players.
<br> 
<br> “There’s Millener,” said Harry. “Doesn’t he look great in his uniform?” Gerald admitted that he did, but insisted that Colton looked finer.
<br> 
<br> “Look at Danforth!” said Gerald a moment later. “He hasn’t got his uniform on! I’ll bet he isn’t going to play!”
<br> 
<br> “He’s sick, that’s what’s the matter with him,” responded Harry bitterly. “Look at him. He looks like a sheet of paper. Isn’t that the toughest luck you ever saw? Why, he’s one of our best players; we haven’t got anyone else can play second like Danforth!”
<br> 
<br> “Who’ll they use?” asked Gerald anxiously.
<br> 
<br> “Tufts, I guess; he’s the regular sub. But he isn’t any good. We’ll find out in a minute, though, for they’re going out to practice.” Gerald turned to acquaint his father with the heart-breaking news, but Mr. Pennimore had discovered an acquaintance in the lady at his other side and was busily engaged in conversation. Then the team trotted out for practice, and Gerald, discovering Dan amongst the players, held his breath until the youth had taken his position at second. Then he turned radiantly to Harry. But Harry had seen for himself, and their exclamations of wonderment and delight exploded together.
<br> 
<br> [294]
<br> 
<br> “Dan,” cried Gerald.
<br> 
<br> “Vinton!” cried Harry.
<br> 
<br> For the next few minutes they excitedly discussed this new development in all its phases. Mr. Pennimore was informed and expressed the proper degree of pleasure and excitement. But he made a terrible mistake the next moment when he inquired whether anyone had made a run yet. Gerald sat on him properly, informing him that the game hadn’t begun. Then Broadwood came onto the field and the cheers drowned conversation for a full minute. Yardley retired to the bench and Gerald and Harry watched the rival team’s practice with critical eyes. But they were forced to acknowledge that “Broadwood certainly could field,” and that if the Green played that way in the game, Yardley would have hard work winning. At last, at half-past two, the umpire called the captains to him, Millener of Yardley and Gale of Broadwood, and there was a minute’s conference at the plate. Then Gale turned to the bench and raised his hand.
<br> 
<br> “On the run, fellows!” he called.
<br> 
<br> Broadwood took the field and Gerald and Harry examined the Blue’s pitcher with interest as he began throwing into the catcher’s mitt to limber up. He was as tall as Colton, but slenderer, had dark hair and a rather surly expression about[295] his mouth except when he smiled. His movements, save when actually pitching, were deliberate to a degree.
<br> 
<br> “He doesn’t look much,” confided Gerald.
<br> 
<br> “But you wait and see,” muttered Harry. “He’s all right. Here comes Durfee to bat. I say! They’ve gone and changed the batting order, haven’t they?”
<br> 
<br> “Probably because Danforth’s out,” suggested Gerald wisely. “Seems to me it’s a good scheme to have Durfee bat first, because if he does get to first he’s pretty sure to steal safely.”
<br> 
<br> Little Durfee, the Yardley shortstop, spread his legs, gripped his bat and faced the pitcher.
<br> 
<br> “Play ball!” said the umpire.
<br> 
<br> And the “Big Game” was on.
<br> 
<br> A moment later the Yardley partisans were leaping and shouting for joy. Durfee bunted past Herring and the pitcher fielded too late. Durfee was credited with a hit, but with a quicker man in the box he would never have reached first safely. But he was there, very much there, and that was enough for the wavers of the blue flags. Then came Colton, and there were cries of “Home run, Colton! Hit it out!” And in the outfield the players stepped back, for Colton’s reputation was well known. With two balls and one strike on him, Colton raised his bat in front of a waist-high[296] ball and sent it rolling slowly toward third. Third baseman and pitcher both made for it, but it was a clean hit this time and Durfee was safe at second and Colton at first. How Yardley did shriek and yell!
<br> 
<br> “Well, I guess that’ll do for a starter!” shrieked Smith, coaching back of first. “I guess that’s going some! On your toes, now! Down with his arm!”
<br> 
<br> Herring, plainly worried, tried to throw Colton out at first, but Smith laughed derisively and Colton climbed to his feet again, dusted the front of his clothes and edged again into a lead. Herring scowled, glanced around at Durfee, who was dancing back and forth at second, and settled down to the next man, Condit. Evidently Condit thought that what had served twice would serve again, or maybe he had his orders from the bench. At all events, he, too, bunted. The ball rolled toward the pitcher’s box as straight as an arrow and Herring scooped it up. But he was rattled, threw hurriedly and the ball instead of reaching first baseman’s hands landed on Condit’s shoulder and glanced away under the rope. Little Durfee raced home, Colton went to third and Condit took second.
<br> 
<br> The Yardley cheers were deafening. Gerald and Harry pounded each other on the back and[297] shrieked into each other’s ears, and even Mr. Pennimore was excited and kept saying “Good! Good! Good!” over and over in a voice that, owing to the noise about him, no one could possibly hear. Patterson, Broadwood’s catcher, held a consultation with Herring midway between box and plate, and everyone knew that he was trying to steady the pitcher down. That his efforts were successful was proved a minute later when Lawrence hit a ball into Herring’s territory and was thrown out neatly. However, that was only one out and Yardley was still delirious with joy.
<br> 
<br> Alf Loring was up next and he, like Colton, was enthusiastically advised to “Lam it out for a homer!” “Knock the cover off it, Alf!” He didn’t quite do that, but he managed to find one to his liking and singled to center, scoring Colton and Condit. Alf himself, however, went out trying to make second, and when Richards struck out miserably a few minutes later, the side was out and Broadwood was so relieved that she cheered long and loudly. Yardley let her cheer. With three runs already to her credit she could afford to be indulgent.
<br> 
<br> For Broadwood, Cross, second baseman, was the first man up. Colton’s first ball went wild and took Mr. Cross squarely in the ribs, dropping[298] him where he stood, but not incapacitating him from hobbling to first a moment afterwards. So apparently painful was his progress down the line that Yardley men forbore to jeer and a murmur of sympathy arose from the feminine onlookers. Colton looked quite remorseful for a moment, but for a moment only. For just as soon as he had transferred his regard from Cross to the man at the bat, Cross, disabilities and all, streaked down to second, making one of the prettiest steals of the day and awakening peals of laughter from friend and foe alike. Dan ran to the base to cover, but Richards was taken so wholly by surprise that he didn’t even make the motion to throw down. Colton looked disgusted, tried to catch Cross napping, and turned his attention resolutely to the batsman. But Colton hadn’t found himself yet; that was apparent to everyone. With two balls and two strikes on the batsman he was unable to please the umpire and Captain Gale walked to first.
<br> 
<br> The next man came to bat and swung at a wide one and an attempt at a double steal was made. Cross, however, was out on a fast throw from catcher to third and it was a close decision that called Gale safe on second, so rapidly did the ball fly about. Such snappy work deserved applause and received it. The batsman made the second[299] out, Colton to Millener, and right-fielder Boudinot, who followed him, fell a victim to Colton’s deceptive curves and canny change of speed. So ended the first inning, the score 3 to 0 and Yardley well pleased and confident of the outcome.
<br> 
<br> Dan’s first chance at the willow came in the next inning, after Millener, first man up, had hit a hard liner that first baseman was unable to handle. I wish I could say that Dan faced the enemy’s pitcher unflinchingly and drove out a three-bagger. But truth compels me to narrate the fact that Dan did nothing of the sort. It was his first appearance in a big game and he was distinctly nervous; and Herring and Patterson saw it and simply toyed with him. He aided in his own defeat by knocking two flies in succession, and then reached out for a wide ball and walked dejectedly back to the bench. He found the whole team smiling, not maliciously, but with a sort of “We’ve-all-been-there” expression that was rather comforting to him and helped him hold his head up again.
<br> 
<br> “You’ll do better next time,” muttered Alf, clapping him on the knee. “Just don’t let him scare you, Dan.”
<br> 
<br> Smith, who followed Dan at the bat, hit to Broadwood’s second baseman and a neat double play retired the side.
<br> 
<br> [300]
<br> 
<br> When Broadwood came up Colton was master of the situation and retired her in one, two, three order.
<br> 
<br> The first of the third found the head of the Yardley batting list up. Yardley cheers broke forth encouragingly as little Durfee selected his bat and strode to the plate. But a foul which settled with a smack into Patterson’s mitt spoiled his career at the outset. When, however, Colton smashed out a two-bagger over shortstop’s head, things looked rosy again. But Colton was too ambitious and was an easy out in trying to steal third. Condit popped an infield fly. Again Broadwood fell victim to Colton.
<br> 
<br> In the fourth inning Loring followed Colton’s example and got two bases on a drive into left field. Unfortunately he followed the pitcher’s example too closely and, like him, was put out trying to steal third.
<br> 
<br> Broadwood had a streak of luck in her half. With one down, Russell was hit by Colton and went to first. Boudinot then took advantage of Colton’s moment of upset and landed on an easy ball and sent it arching into center field. Out there there was a mix-up and Smith and Lawrence, each trying for the catch, collided and the ball fell to earth, leaving Russell on second and Boudinot on first. With only one man out, Kent[301] sacrificed and advanced the runners. Broadwood was cheering imploringly for runs. Patterson, her catcher, looked wicked as he faced Colton. Colton settled down and pitched carefully, but Patterson was not to be denied. There was a sharp crack and away went the ball far over center-fielder’s head. That hit was good for three bases, and Russell and Boudinot scored.
<br> 
<br> Broadwood went crazy with joy and the green banners waved tumultuously. Up on the grand stand, Mr. Pennimore, Gerald, and Harry unanimously agreed that “it was perfectly rotten.” There was still a man on third and Broadwood kept up her cheering as Bray, her big first baseman, took his place at the plate. But Bray was far too eager to hit and Colton disposed of him easily.
<br> 
<br> With the score 3 to 2 in Yardley’s favor the game went on without further scoring until the sixth inning. Anyone not owning allegiance to Blue or Green would probably have voted the next inning and a half quite uninteresting. But to the audience it was all breathlessly exciting. Every move in the game was closely watched, every moment had its thrill. Dan faced the redoubtable Herring again in the fifth, and, although he was not so nervous this time, he again failed to connect with the ball. In the first of[302] the sixth Yardley got a man as far as second, but no further.
<br> 
<br> When Broadwood came to bat in their half of this inning it was seen that the first man up was a new player. His name was Little and he had taken Russell’s place in center field. Broadwood cheered expectantly when he stepped to the plate. Evidently he had a reputation as a hitter. If he had, he fully lived up to it, for he found the second ball offered and sent it over Lawrence’s head for a home-run, tying the score and throwing Broadwood adherents into a veritable delirium of delight.
<br> 
<br> “Why didn’t Lawrence play further out?” demanded Harry angrily. “I saw Millener wave to him. I’ll bet that run will lose us the game!”
<br> 
<br> “It doesn’t look as easy as it did after the first inning, does it?” asked Gerald dubiously. “Still, we’ve got just as good a show as they have.”
<br> 
<br> “No, we haven’t. They’re beginning to find Colton now. They’ll start in and knock him all over the place, I’ll bet! You just wait and see!” Harry’s tones were so lugubrious that Mr. Pennimore thought he ought to cheer him up. So he remarked pleasantly:
<br> 
<br> “Well, well, that was a fine hit, wasn’t it?”
<br> 
<br> [303]
<br> 
<br> The remark was received with silent disgust.
<br> 
<br> Amidst renewed cheering from Broadwood, Boudinot stepped to the plate and gripped his bat.
