Colton steadied down magnificently and Boudinot, Kent and Patterson were easy victims. A sigh of relief swept over the Yardley ranks as the last men went out. Fortune still smiled impartially upon the Blue and the Green alike, and there were still three innings to be contested.
<br> 
<br> A little breeze came along the hillside and brought a measure of relief to the perspiring players and spectators. The sun was almost two hours nearer the horizon.
<br> 
<br> In the first of the seventh Yardley again got men on bases, and with two out and men on first and second, Dan went to bat. As he picked out his bat he looked inquiringly at Payson, but the coach shook his head. “Do the best you can,” he said simply. Dan’s best wasn’t good enough. It was an easy hit into second baseman’s glove. Secretly, however, he was encouraged, and entertained hopes of being able to get a safe hit off[305] the Blue’s pitcher before the game was over. That hope wasn’t realized, but it comforted Dan at the time.
<br> 
<br> Colton pitched wonderful ball in the seventh and eighth, and Broadwood could do nothing with him, although in the eighth an error on the part of Condit at third put a man safe on first, and a poor throw to second by Richards later gave the same runner another base. But he didn’t get beyond the second bag.
<br> 
<br> The ninth inning opened with Lawrence at bat for the Blue. Yardley had congregated her cheering forces back of third base and was whooping things up in great style. The time had come for a rally and the School at large meant to do all it could to bring it about. The blue-stockinged players themselves brightened up and looked more determined. Up in the grand-stand Gerald and Harry were leaning forward on the edge of the seat and breathing hard. Mr. Pennimore had lighted a cigar. As he was an infrequent smoker, Gerald knew that the cigar was to quiet his father’s nerves.
<br> 
<br> Lawrence came to bat, looking fiercely determined, and after he had struck four fouls hit the ball into first baseman’s hands. A poor beginning, that. But the cheerers seemed undismayed and when Loring followed him they gave[306] him a cheer that was a cheer, a cheer with three “Lorings” on the end.
<br> 
<br> Alf had been batting finely and great things were expected of him. Just what he would have accomplished will never be known, for an in-shoot struck him on the wrist and he walked to first nursing the injured member and scowling fearsomely at Herring. Herring, however, was probably quite as regretful over the occurrence as Alf. Once on the bag Alf recovered his good temper and, just to prove that all was forgiven, immediately stole second amidst the wild plaudits of his friends. He made a fine slide and beat the ball by what looked to be about a half-inch, but which was probably somewhat more. Richards, looking just as grimly determined as Lawrence, singled between shortstop and third baseman, and Alf went on to third. He would have kept on for home, and might possibly have made it, had not Colton, coaching behind that base, held him. Colton came in for a good deal of criticism, but with only one out, he played it safely and wisely.
<br> 
<br> Millener went to bat with Alf on third and Richards on first. Richards was not a good man at stealing and Durfee, who was coaching at first, held him there and awaited a hit. Millener was anxious enough to hit, too; you could see that. But nothing came to his liking. Perhaps the[307] cross-fire of coaching got on Herring’s nerves. At all events, after scoring two strikes on Millener he was unable to put another ball over, and Millener trotted to first on four balls. That filled the bases and Yardley’s cheering took on new volume and stridency. Surely the game was won now! With three on bases and only one man down, things looked very good!
<br> 
<br> But when it was seen that the man up was Vinton, the prospect didn’t appear quite so bright. Vinton had shown that while he could play his position at second to the King’s taste he was no batter. Many wondered why Payson didn’t substitute another player, one whose ability to bat was proved. The truth is that Payson didn’t dare to, as he explained afterwards. He expected the game to run into extra innings and he had no one amongst the substitutes who could hold down second satisfactorily. So he chanced it, knowing that even if Dan went out there was still Smith to depend on.
<br> 
<br> Dan, when he realized the situation and what was expected of him, rather wished for a moment that Payson had taken him out. But that was for a moment only. Then his fighting spirit arose and he determined to show them that Payson knew what he was about. So he faced Herring with a fine assumption of confidence and so impressed[308] the latter that when the catcher called for a straight ball he shook his head and tried a drop instead. Dan was learning now, and the drop didn’t deceive him. He let it go by and heard the umpire say “Ball!” But the next delivery caught him napping, and the score was even. Then came something that looked just about right, and Dan stepped forward and struck it. But the ball went glancing back over the stop and the umpire called “Foul! Strike two!”
<br> 
<br> Dan’s heart sank then. But outwardly he only smiled grimly and took a firmer grip on the bat. The next delivery was so palpably wide that Dan didn’t even hesitate about refusing it. Then perhaps Herring was impatient, for he sent a slow ball that dropped ever so little as it neared the plate, and Dan, with a sudden suffocating sensation in his throat, swung at it hard. Bat and ball met with a comforting sound that sent him speeding down the line to first. High and far went the ball. Dan rounded first and started toward second. Then, realizing that he was blocked, he slowed up and scampered back so as not to be in the way of Millener if that player had to return to first. That was a long fly, but Broadwood’s center-fielder was under it as it came down, and Dan was out.
<br> 
<br> Over on third, however, Alf was poised, one[309] foot on the bag, ready to sprint for home as soon as the ball touched earth or player. And the instant center-fielder caught it Alf settled his head between his shoulders and dug out for the plate. In came the ball, center-fielder to shortstop, shortstop to catcher, but it didn’t come quick enough to keep Alf from scoring. He was over the base and rolling out of the way amidst a cloud of dust when the catcher swung for him. And down on third Richards was watching hard for a chance to follow Alf in, and on second Millener was dancing exultantly about. Dan walked back to the bench and into the arms of the players there. They thumped him and shouted congratulations into his ears. They had to shout, for the cheering section was making such a noise that only shouts could be heard even over here at the bench. Dan grinned and sank into a seat. Danforth, whom Dan had displaced at second and who had been looking pretty glum all the afternoon, reached over and shook hands smilingly. Then came Alf and squeezed himself in beside Dan and rumpled his hair and punched him and beamed ecstatically. Meanwhile Smith was trying what he could do. Two balls and then a shout of joy as the ball arched up and away into left field dwindling to silence as left-fielder pulled it down, tossed away his glove and trotted in.
<br> 
<br> [310]
<br> 
<br> The side was out and the score stood 4 to 3 in Yardley’s favor. Cheered to the echo the blue-stockinged players ran into the field. The day was not yet won, and they all realized it. Some of the enemy’s best batters were coming up and if victory was to remain with the Blue it behooved the latter’s warriors to battle grandly.
<br> 
<br> “Now, then, fellows!” cried Millener. “Buck up, and get this over! Play the game!”
<br> 
<br> The last half began amidst such a pandemonium of sound as hadn’t been heard on Broadwood Field for years. Cheers for Yardley and cheers for Broadwood met in midfield and clashed heavenward in a mighty volume. Then, “Batter up, please!” called the umpire, and the final struggle was on.
<br> 
<br> Cross, the first of the foe to face Colton, was an easy proposition and struck out miserably. And Yardley acclaimed wildly. Then came Gale, the Broadwood captain. He looked at once anxious and determined. He found the first ball thrown for a safe hit over shortstop. Then it was Broadwood’s turn to shout, and she did it. After Gale came the dangerous Little, and the Yardley outfield fell further back. But although Little hit, his effort was good for only one base. Things began to look interesting now and Boudinot, after lingering at the bench for several[311] moments listening to instructions, stepped to the plate with a gleam in his eye that put Colton on his mettle.
<br> 
<br> For a minute or two it seemed that Colton had taken his measure, for he worked two strikes on him in succession. But after that Colton couldn’t please the umpire and Boudinot walked to first and filled the bases. If there had been pandemonium before, what ensued is beyond any language I know. Back of first and third the Broadwood coachers were yelling themselves hoarse. Colton was plainly nervous, so nervous that he made the mistake of throwing to first in an attempt to catch the runner there. That almost proved disastrous, for Millener was not looking for the throw, and only stopped it by a hair’s breadth. If it had gone by, at least two men would have scored and the game would have been lost then and there. Richards walked down to the box and talked a moment with Colton, finally clapping him encouragingly on the shoulder before he returned to his mask and mitt.
<br> 
<br> Broadwood’s next man was Kent, the shortstop. He wasn’t big but he was spry and very much in earnest. He smiled derisively at the first ball and looked pained when the umpire called it a strike. He even wanted to argue about it, but the official refused to let him. So he gave his attention[312] to Colton instead, looking quite incensed. Colton sent in an exasperating in-shoot that fooled Kent quite as fully as had the first delivery and the umpire called:
<br> 
<br> “Strike two!”
<br> 
<br> Kent got madder still, so mad that he quite forgot caution and stepped out after the next ball and, contrary to all law, found it squarely on the end of his bat. In raced the man on third, down from second went the next runner, off for second streaked the third, and away went Kent and the ball simultaneously, the former for the first bag and the latter, to all appearances, for somewhere in right center-field. Broadwood leaped deliriously and waved her banners. All this is what the first moment saw. The next saw a lad poised midway between first base and second and some yards back of the line, leap high into the air in the path of the speeding ball, saw the ball tip the upthrust glove, bound into the air, and come down in that same glove, saw the lad race to second and tag that base, and saw Broadwood’s discomfiture and defeat, Yardley’s ecstasy and victory!
<br> 
<br> Over on a corner of the Yardley bench the scorer bent over his book while the crowds overflowed the field. He was putting the finishing touches to his work, and as he figured the last[313] summary he smiled in contentment. Here is the story the score-book told:

<br> 
<br> What a journey home in the automobile that was! Mr. Pennimore, Gerald, Dan, Alf, and Harry in the tonneau, and Tom beside the chauffeur! How the blue flags snapped and fluttered[314] their signal of victory as the big car ate up the white road! How, as they rehearsed the struggle, they always came back sooner or later to Dan’s double play!
<br> 
<br> “Why, Dan,” declared Alf vehemently, “you won that game just as much as though you had made a home-run with the bases full! If you hadn’t doubled then Broadwood would have scored twice at least! Confound you, Dan, you’re always doing some spectacular stunt and making a blooming hero of yourself! Why can’t I be a hero, I’d like to know? But you just wait until next year. If I can’t find any other way of doing it I’ll set fire to Dudley and rescue Tom in his nightie from the devouring flames! I’ll be a hero or perish!”
<br> 
<br> “So that,” inquired Mr. Pennimore when they had ceased laughing at Alf’s sally, “is what you call a ‘double play.’ Well, it strikes me, Dan, that double plays are your forte.”
<br> 
<br> “That’s the first one I ever made, sir,” answered Dan.
<br> 
<br> Mr. Pennimore smiled.
<br> 
<br> “Technically, yes, I dare say. But I wonder if we can’t put the term ‘double play’ to a broader interpretation. It seems to me, now, that anyone who not only makes his own career successful but finds time to look after the welfare of his[315] friend might very well be said to be making a double play. What do you say, Mr. Dyer?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, sir, you’re right,” answered Tom with decision. “And that’s just what Dan’s done, as we all know.”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, and here is one who knows it better than the rest of us,” said Mr. Pennimore, with an affectionate look at Gerald.
<br> 
<br> Gerald smiled and glanced shyly at Dan.
<br> 
<br> “I know one time when he made a double play, and a bully one,” he affirmed amidst laughter. “And that was when I tried to make a ‘steal for home.’”
<br> 
<br> “And which,” added Mr. Pennimore, “unlike most ‘double plays,’ instead of resulting in a ‘put-out’ perhaps prevented one!”
<br> 
<br> And he chuckled quite as heartily as any one at his joke.
<br> 
<br> Here, then, let us leave them for a time, speeding home through the warm, amber glow of late afternoon, the wind in their faces and joy in their hearts, feeling as only boys can feel after a battle bravely fought and a victory well won.
