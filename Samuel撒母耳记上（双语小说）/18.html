<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now after David's talk with Saul was ended, the soul of Jonathan was joined with the soul of David, and David became as dear to him as his very life. 
<br>18:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 日 扫 罗 留 住 大 卫 ， 不 容 他 再 回 父 家 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And that day Saul took David and would not let him go back to his father's house. 
<br>18:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 拿 单 爱 大 卫 如 同 爱 自 己 的 性 命 ， 就 与 他 结 盟 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Jonathan and David made an agreement together, because of Jonathan's love for David. 
<br>18:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 拿 单 从 身 上 脱 下 外 袍 ， 给 了 大 卫 ， 又 将 战 衣 ， 刀 ， 弓 ， 腰 带 都 给 了 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Jonathan took off the robe he had on and gave it to David, with all his military dress, even to his sword and his bow and the band round his body. 
<br>18:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 无 论 差 遣 大 卫 往 何 处 去 ， 他 都 作 事 精 明 。 扫 罗 就 立 他 作 战 士 长 ， 众 百 姓 和 扫 罗 的 臣 仆 无 不 喜 悦 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And David went wherever Saul sent him, and did wisely: and Saul put him at the head of his men of war, and this was pleasing to all the people as well as to Saul's servants. 
<br>18:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 打 死 了 那 非 利 士 人 ， 同 众 人 回 来 的 时 候 ， 妇 女 们 从 以 色 列 各 城 里 出 来 ， 欢 欢 喜 喜 ， 打 鼓 击 磬 ， 歌 唱 跳 舞 ， 迎 接 扫 罗 王 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now on their way, when David came back after the destruction of the Philistine, the women came out of all the towns of Israel, with songs and dances, meeting David with melody and joy and instruments of music. 
<br>18:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 众 妇 女 舞 蹈 唱 和 ， 说 ， 扫 罗 杀 死 千 千 ， 大 卫 杀 死 万 万 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the women, answering one another in their song, said, Saul has put to death his thousands and David his tens of thousands. 
<br>18:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 甚 发 怒 ， 不 喜 悦 这 话 ， 就 说 ， 将 万 万 归 大 卫 ， 千 千 归 我 ， 只 剩 下 王 位 没 有 给 他 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul was very angry and this saying was unpleasing to him; and he said, They have given David credit for tens of thousands, and to me for only thousands: what more is there for him but the kingdom? 
<br>18:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 从 这 日 起 ， 扫 罗 就 怒 视 大 卫 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul eyed David from that day and forward. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And from that day Saul was looking with envy on David. 
<br>18:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 次 日 ， 从 神 那 里 来 的 恶 魔 大 大 降 在 扫 罗 身 上 ， 他 就 在 家 中 胡 言 乱 语 。 大 卫 照 常 弹 琴 ， 扫 罗 手 里 拿 着 枪 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now on the day after, an evil spirit from God came on Saul with great force and he was acting like a prophet among the men of his house, while David was making music for him, as he did day by day: and Saul had his spear in his hand. 
<br>18:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 把 枪 一 抡 ， 心 里 说 ， 我 要 将 大 卫 刺 透 ， 钉 在 墙 上 。 大 卫 躲 避 他 两 次 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul, balancing the spear in his hand, said, I will give David a blow, pinning him to the wall. And David got away from him twice. 
<br>18:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 惧 怕 大 卫 。 因 为 耶 和 华 离 开 自 己 ， 与 大 卫 同 在 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul went in fear of David, because the Lord was with David and had gone away from Saul. 
<br>18:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 所 以 扫 罗 使 大 卫 离 开 自 己 ， 立 他 为 千 夫 长 ， 他 就 领 兵 出 入 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So Saul sent him away, and made him a captain over a thousand; and he went about his business before the people. 
<br>18:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 作 事 无 不 精 明 ， 耶 和 华 也 与 他 同 在 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And in all his undertakings David did wisely; and the Lord was with him. 
<br>18:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 见 大 卫 作 事 精 明 ， 就 甚 怕 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when Saul saw how wisely he did, he was in fear of him. 
<br>18:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 但 以 色 列 和 犹 大 众 人 都 爱 大 卫 ， 因 为 他 领 他 们 出 入 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But David was loved by all Israel and Judah, for he went out and came in before them. 
<br>18:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 对 大 卫 说 ， 我 将 大 女 儿 米 拉 给 你 为 妻 ， 只 要 你 为 我 奋 勇 ， 为 耶 和 华 争 战 。 扫 罗 心 里 说 ， 我 不 好 亲 手 害 他 ， 要 借 非 利 士 人 的 手 害 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul said to David, Here is my oldest daughter Merab, whom I will give you for your wife: only be strong for me, fighting in the Lord's wars. For Saul said, Let it not be through me that his fate comes to him, but through the Philistines. 
<br>18:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 对 扫 罗 说 ， 我 是 谁 ？ 我 是 什 么 出 身 ， 我 父 家 在 以 色 列 中 是 何 等 的 家 ， 岂 敢 作 王 的 女 婿 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And David said to Saul, Who am I, and what is my father's family in Israel, that I am to be son-in-law to the king? 
<br>18:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 的 女 儿 米 拉 到 了 当 给 大 卫 的 时 候 ， 扫 罗 却 给 了 米 何 拉 人 亚 得 列 为 妻 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But when the time came to give Merab, Saul's daughter, to David, she was given to Adriel of Meholath. 
<br>18:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 的 次 女 米 甲 爱 大 卫 。 有 人 告 诉 扫 罗 ， 扫 罗 就 喜 悦 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul's daughter Michal was in love with David: and Saul had word of it and was pleased. 
<br>18:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 心 里 说 ， 我 将 这 女 儿 给 大 卫 ， 作 他 的 网 罗 ， 好 借 非 利 士 人 的 手 害 他 。 所 以 扫 罗 对 大 卫 说 ， 你 今 日 可 以 第 二 次 作 我 的 女 婿 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul said, I will give her to him, so that she may be a cause of danger to him, and so that the hands of the Philistines may be against him. So Saul said to David, Today you are to become my son-in-law for the second time. 
<br>18:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 吩 咐 臣 仆 说 ， 你 们 暗 中 对 大 卫 说 ， 王 喜 悦 你 ， 王 的 臣 仆 也 都 喜 爱 你 ， 所 以 你 当 作 王 的 女 婿 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul gave his servants orders saying, Have talk with David secretly and say to him, See how the king has delight in you, and how you are loved by all his servants: then be the king's son-in-law. 
<br>18:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 的 臣 仆 就 照 这 话 说 给 大 卫 听 。 大 卫 说 ， 你 们 以 为 作 王 的 女 婿 是 一 件 小 事 吗 ？ 我 是 贫 穷 卑 微 的 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul's servants said these things to David. And David said, Does it seem to you a small thing to be the king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, of no great name? 
<br>18:24 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 的 臣 仆 回 奏 说 ， 大 卫 所 说 的 如 此 如 此 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the servants of Saul gave him an account of what David had said. 
<br>18:25 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 说 ， 你 们 要 对 大 卫 这 样 说 ， 王 不 要 什 么 聘 礼 ， 只 要 一 百 非 利 士 人 的 阳 皮 ， 好 在 王 的 仇 敌 身 上 报 仇 。 扫 罗 的 意 思 要 使 大 卫 丧 在 非 利 士 人 的 手 里 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul said, Then say to David, The king has no desire for any bride-price, but only for the private parts of a hundred Philistines so that the king may get the better of his haters. But it was in Saul's mind that David might come to his end by the hands of the Philistines. 
<br>18:26 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 的 臣 仆 将 这 话 告 诉 大 卫 ， 大 卫 就 欢 喜 作 王 的 女 婿 。 日 期 还 没 有 到 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when his servants said these words to David, he was well pleased to be the son-in-law of the king. And the days were still not past. 
<br>18:27 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 和 跟 随 他 的 人 起 身 前 往 ， 杀 了 二 百 非 利 士 人 ， 将 阳 皮 满 数 交 给 王 ， 为 要 作 王 的 女 婿 。 于 是 扫 罗 将 女 儿 米 甲 给 大 卫 为 妻 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So David and his men got up and went, and put to death two hundred of the Philistines; and David took their private parts and gave the full number of them to the king, so that he might be the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him his daughter Michal for his wife. 
<br>18:28 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 见 耶 和 华 与 大 卫 同 在 ， 又 知 道 女 儿 米 甲 爱 大 卫 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter loved him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And it was clear to Saul that the Lord was with David; and he was loved by all Israel. 
<br>18:29 [hgb]&nbsp; 就 更 怕 大 卫 ， 常 作 大 卫 的 仇 敌 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul's fear of David became all the greater, and he went on hating him, day by day. 
<br>18:30 [hgb]&nbsp; 每 逢 非 利 士 军 长 出 来 打 仗 ， 大 卫 比 扫 罗 的 臣 仆 作 事 精 明 ， 因 此 他 的 名 被 人 尊 重 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the rulers of the Philistines went out to war: and whenever they went out, David did more wisely than all the other servants of Saul, so that his name became greatly honoured.
