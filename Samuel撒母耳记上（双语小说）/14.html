<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now one day Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to the young man who was with him, looking after his arms, Come, let us go over to the Philistine force over there. But he said nothing to his father. 
<br>14:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 在 基 比 亚 的 尽 边 ， 坐 在 米 矶 仑 的 石 榴 树 下 ， 跟 随 他 的 约 有 六 百 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul was still waiting in the farthest part of Geba, under the fruit-tree in Migron: there were about six hundred men with him; 
<br>14:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 在 那 里 有 亚 希 突 的 儿 子 亚 希 亚 ， 穿 着 以 弗 得 。 亚 希 突 是 以 迦 博 的 哥 哥 ， 非 尼 哈 的 儿 子 ， 以 利 的 孙 子 。 以 利 从 前 在 示 罗 作 耶 和 华 的 祭 司 。 约 拿 单 去 了 ， 百 姓 却 不 知 道 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, brother of Ichabod, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of the Lord in Shiloh, who had the ephod. And the people had no idea that Jonathan had gone. 
<br>14:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 拿 单 要 从 隘 口 过 到 非 利 士 防 营 那 里 去 。 这 隘 口 两 边 各 有 一 个 山 峰 ， 一 名 播 薛 ， 一 名 西 尼 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now between the narrow roads over the mountains by which Jonathan was making his way to the Philistines' forces, there was a sharp overhanging rock on one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: one was named Bozez and the other Seneh. 
<br>14:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 一 峰 向 北 ， 与 密 抹 相 对 ， 一 峰 向 南 ， 与 迦 巴 相 对 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The one rock went up on the north in front of Michmash and the other on the south in front of Geba. 
<br>14:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 拿 单 对 拿 兵 器 的 少 年 人 说 ， 我 们 不 如 过 到 未 受 割 礼 人 的 防 营 那 里 去 ， 或 者 耶 和 华 为 我 们 施 展 能 力 。 因 为 耶 和 华 使 人 得 胜 ， 不 在 乎 人 多 人 少 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Jonathan said to his young servant who had his arms, Come, let us go over to the armies of these men who have no circumcision: it may be that the Lord will give us help, for there is no limit to his power; the Lord is able to give salvation by a great army or by a small band. 
<br>14:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 拿 兵 器 的 对 他 说 ， 随 你 的 心 意 行 吧 。 你 可 以 上 去 ， 我 必 跟 随 你 ， 与 你 同 心 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And his servant said to him, Do whatever is in your mind: see, I am with you in every impulse of your heart. 
<br>14:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 拿 单 说 ， 我 们 要 过 到 那 些 人 那 里 去 ， 使 他 们 看 见 我 们 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Jonathan said, Now we will go over to these men and let them see us. 
<br>14:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 若 对 我 们 说 ， 你 们 站 住 ， 等 我 们 到 你 们 那 里 去 ， 我 们 就 站 住 ， 不 上 他 们 那 里 去 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; If they say to us, Keep quiet where you are till we come to you; then we will keep our places and not go up to them. 
<br>14:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 若 说 ， 你 们 上 到 我 们 这 里 来 ， 这 话 就 是 我 们 的 证 据 。 我 们 便 上 去 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 将 他 们 交 在 我 们 手 里 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But if they say, Come up to us; then we will go up, for the Lord has given them into our hands: and this will be the sign to us. 
<br>14:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 二 人 就 使 非 利 士 的 防 兵 看 见 。 非 利 士 人 说 ， 希 伯 来 人 从 所 藏 的 洞 穴 里 出 来 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And they let the Philistine force see the two of them: and the Philistines said, Look! the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have taken cover. 
<br>14:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 防 兵 对 约 拿 单 和 拿 兵 器 的 人 说 ， 你 们 上 到 这 里 来 ， 我 们 有 一 件 事 指 示 你 们 。 约 拿 单 就 对 拿 兵 器 的 人 说 ， 你 跟 随 我 上 去 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 将 他 们 交 在 以 色 列 人 手 里 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the armed men of the force gave Jonathan and his servant their answer, saying, Come up here to us, and we will let you see something. Then Jonathan said to his servant, Come up after me: for the Lord has given them up into the hands of Israel. 
<br>14:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 拿 单 就 爬 上 去 ， 拿 兵 器 的 人 跟 随 他 。 约 拿 单 杀 倒 非 利 士 人 ， 拿 兵 器 的 人 也 随 着 杀 他 们 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Jonathan went up, gripping with his hands and his feet, his servant going up after him; and the Philistines gave way before Jonathan when he made an attack on them, and his servant put them to death after him. 
<br>14:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 拿 单 和 拿 兵 器 的 人 起 头 所 杀 的 约 有 二 十 人 ， 都 在 一 亩 地 的 半 犁 沟 之 内 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And at their first attack, Jonathan and his servant put to the sword about twenty men, all inside the space of half an acre of land. 
<br>14:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 在 营 中 ， 在 田 野 ， 在 众 民 内 都 有 战 兢 ， 防 兵 和 掠 兵 也 都 战 兢 ， 地 也 震 动 ， 战 兢 之 势 甚 大 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And there was great fear in the tents and in the field and among all the men of the armed force, and the attackers were shaking with fear; even the earth was moved with a great shaking and there was a fear as from God. 
<br>14:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 在 便 雅 悯 的 基 比 亚 ， 扫 罗 的 守 望 兵 看 见 非 利 士 的 军 众 溃 散 ， 四 围 乱 窜 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the watchmen of Saul, looking out from Geba in the land of Benjamin, saw all the army flowing away and running here and there. 
<br>14:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 就 对 跟 随 他 的 民 说 ， 你 们 查 点 查 点 ， 看 从 我 们 这 里 出 去 的 是 谁 。 他 们 一 查 点 ， 就 知 道 约 拿 单 和 拿 兵 器 的 人 没 有 在 这 里 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Saul said to the people who were with him, Let everyone be numbered and let us see who has gone from us. And when they had been numbered, it was seen that Jonathan and his servant were not there. 
<br>14:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 时 神 的 约 柜 在 以 色 列 人 那 里 。 扫 罗 对 亚 希 亚 说 ， 你 将 神 的 约 柜 运 了 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul said to Ahijah, Let the ephod come here. For he went before Israel with the ephod at that time. 
<br>14:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 正 与 祭 司 说 话 的 时 候 ， 非 利 士 营 中 的 喧 嚷 越 发 大 了 。 扫 罗 就 对 祭 司 说 ， 停 手 吧 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now while Saul was talking to the priest, the noise in the tents of the Philistines became louder and louder; and Saul said to the priest, Take back your hand. 
<br>14:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 和 跟 随 他 的 人 都 聚 集 ， 来 到 战 场 ， 看 见 非 利 士 人 用 刀 互 相 击 杀 ， 大 大 惶 乱 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul and all the people with him came together and went forward to the fight: and every man's sword was turned against the man at his side, and there was a very great noise. 
<br>14:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 从 前 由 四 方 来 跟 随 非 利 士 军 的 希 伯 来 人 现 在 也 转 过 来 ， 帮 助 跟 随 扫 罗 和 约 拿 单 的 以 色 列 人 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines for some time, and had gone up with them to their tents, turning round were joined to those who were with Saul and Jonathan. 
<br>14:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 藏 在 以 法 莲 山 地 的 以 色 列 人 听 说 非 利 士 人 逃 跑 ， 就 出 来 紧 紧 地 追 杀 他 们 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And all the men of Israel who had taken cover in the hill-country of Ephraim, hearing that the Philistines had been put to flight, went after them, attacking them. 
<br>14:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 日 ， 耶 和 华 使 以 色 列 人 得 胜 ， 一 直 战 到 伯 亚 文 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So the Lord made Israel safe that day: and the fight went over to Beth-aven. 
<br>14:24 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 叫 百 姓 起 誓 说 ， 凡 不 等 到 晚 上 向 敌 人 报 完 了 仇 吃 什 么 的 ， 必 受 咒 诅 。 因 此 这 日 百 姓 没 有 吃 什 么 ， 就 极 其 困 惫 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And all the people were with Saul, about twenty thousand men, and the fight was general through all the hill-country of Ephraim; but Saul made a great error that day, by putting the people under an oath, saying, Let that man be cursed who takes food before evening comes and I have given punishment to those who are against me. So the people had not a taste of food. 
<br>14:25 [hgb]&nbsp; 众 民 进 入 树 林 ， 见 有 蜜 在 地 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And there was honey on the face of the field, and all the people came to the honey, the bees having gone from it; 
<br>14:26 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 进 了 树 林 ， 见 有 蜜 流 下 来 ， 却 没 有 人 敢 用 手 取 蜜 入 口 ， 因 为 他 们 怕 那 誓 言 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But not a man put his hand to his mouth for fear of the curse. 
<br>14:27 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 拿 单 没 有 听 见 他 父 亲 叫 百 姓 起 誓 ， 所 以 伸 手 中 的 杖 ， 用 杖 头 蘸 在 蜂 房 里 ， 转 手 送 入 口 内 ， 眼 睛 就 明 亮 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But Jonathan, having no knowledge of the oath his father had put on the people, stretching out the rod which was in his hand, put the end of it in the honey, and put it to his mouth; then his eyes were made bright. 
<br>14:28 [hgb]&nbsp; 百 姓 中 有 一 人 对 他 说 ， 你 父 亲 曾 叫 百 姓 严 严 地 起 誓 说 ， 今 日 吃 什 么 的 ， 必 受 咒 诅 。 因 此 百 姓 就 疲 乏 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then one of the people said to him, Your father put the people under an oath, saying, Let that man be cursed who takes any food this day. And the people were feeble, needing food. 
<br>14:29 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 拿 单 说 ， 我 父 亲 连 累 你 们 了 。 你 看 ， 我 尝 了 这 一 点 蜜 ， 眼 睛 就 明 亮 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Jonathan said, My father has made trouble come on the land: now see how bright my eyes have become because I have taken a little of this honey. 
<br>14:30 [hgb]&nbsp; 今 日 百 姓 若 任 意 吃 了 从 仇 敌 所 夺 的 物 ， 击 杀 的 非 利 士 人 岂 不 更 多 吗 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; How much more if the people had freely taken their food from the goods of those who were fighting against them! would there not have been much greater destruction among the Philistines? 
<br>14:31 [hgb]&nbsp; 这 日 ， 以 色 列 人 击 杀 非 利 士 人 ， 从 密 抹 直 到 亚 雅 仑 。 百 姓 甚 是 疲 乏 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; That day they overcame the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were feeble from need of food. 
<br>14:32 [hgb]&nbsp; 就 急 忙 将 所 夺 的 牛 羊 和 牛 犊 宰 于 地 上 ， 肉 还 带 血 就 吃 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And rushing at the goods taken in the fight, the people took oxen and sheep and young oxen, and put them to death there on the earth, and had a meal, taking the flesh with the blood in it. 
<br>14:33 [hgb]&nbsp; 有 人 告 诉 扫 罗 说 ， 百 姓 吃 带 血 的 肉 ， 得 罪 耶 和 华 了 。 扫 罗 说 ， 你 们 有 罪 了 ， 今 日 要 将 大 石 头 滚 到 我 这 里 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then it was said to Saul, See, the people are sinning against the Lord, taking the blood with the flesh. And he said to those who gave him the news, Now let a great stone be rolled to me here. 
<br>14:34 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 又 说 ， 你 们 散 在 百 姓 中 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 各 人 将 牛 羊 牵 到 我 这 里 来 宰 了 吃 ， 不 可 吃 带 血 的 肉 得 罪 耶 和 华 。 这 夜 ， 百 姓 就 把 牛 羊 牵 到 那 里 宰 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul said, Go about among the people and say to them, Let every man come here to me with his ox and his sheep, and put them to death here, and take his meal: do no sin against the Lord by taking the blood with the flesh. So all the people took their oxen with them that night and put them to death there. 
<br>14:35 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 为 耶 和 华 筑 了 一 座 坛 ， 这 是 他 初 次 为 耶 和 华 筑 的 坛 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul put up an altar to the Lord: this was the first altar which he put up to the Lord. 
<br>14:36 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 说 ， 我 们 不 如 夜 里 下 去 追 赶 非 利 士 人 ， 抢 掠 他 们 ， 直 到 天 亮 ， 不 留 他 们 一 人 。 众 民 说 ， 你 看 怎 样 好 就 去 行 吧 。 祭 司 说 ， 我 们 先 当 亲 近 神 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, attacking them till the morning, till there is not a man of them living. And they said, Do whatever seems right to you. Then the priest said, Let us come near to God. 
<br>14:37 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 求 问 神 说 ， 我 下 去 追 赶 非 利 士 人 可 以 不 可 以 。 你 将 他 们 交 在 以 色 列 人 手 里 不 交 。 这 日 神 没 有 回 答 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul, desiring directions from God, said, Am I to go down after the Philistines? will you give them up into the hands of Israel? But he gave him no answer that day. 
<br>14:38 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 说 ， 你 们 百 姓 中 的 长 老 都 上 这 里 来 ， 查 明 今 日 是 谁 犯 了 罪 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul said, Come near, all you chiefs of the people, and let us get word from God and see in whom is this sin today. 
<br>14:39 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 指 着 救 以 色 列 永 生 的 耶 和 华 起 誓 ， 就 是 我 儿 子 约 拿 单 犯 了 罪 ， 他 也 必 死 。 但 百 姓 中 无 一 人 回 答 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For, by the living Lord, the saviour of Israel, even if the sinner is Jonathan, my son, death will certainly be his fate. But not a man among all the people gave him any answer. 
<br>14:40 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 就 对 以 色 列 众 人 说 ， 你 们 站 在 一 边 ， 我 与 我 儿 子 约 拿 单 也 站 在 一 边 。 百 姓 对 扫 罗 说 ， 你 看 怎 样 好 就 去 行 吧 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then he said to all Israel, You be on one side, and I with Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said to Saul, Do whatever seems good to you. 
<br>14:41 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 祷 告 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 说 ， 求 你 指 示 实 情 。 于 是 掣 签 掣 出 扫 罗 和 约 拿 单 来 。 百 姓 尽 都 无 事 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Saul said to the Lord, the God of Israel, Why have you not given me an answer today? If the sin is in me or in Jonathan my son, O Lord God of Israel, give Urim, and if it is in your people Israel, give Thummim. And by the decision of the Lord, Saul and Jonathan were marked out, and the people went free. 
<br>14:42 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 说 ， 你 们 再 掣 签 ， 看 是 我 ， 是 我 儿 子 约 拿 单 ， 就 掣 出 约 拿 单 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul said, Give your decision between my son Jonathan and me. And Jonathan was taken. 
<br>14:43 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 对 约 拿 单 说 ， 你 告 诉 我 ， 你 作 了 什 么 事 。 约 拿 单 说 ， 我 实 在 以 手 里 的 杖 ， 用 杖 头 蘸 了 一 点 蜜 尝 了 一 尝 。 这 样 我 就 死 吗 （ 吗 或 作 吧 ） 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Saul said to Jonathan, Give me an account of what you have done. And Jonathan gave him the story and said, Certainly I took a little honey on the end of my rod; and now death is to be my fate. 
<br>14:44 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 说 ， 约 拿 单 哪 ， 你 定 要 死 。 若 不 然 ， 愿 神 重 重 地 降 罚 与 我 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul said, May God's punishment be on me if death is not your fate, Jonathan. 
<br>14:45 [hgb]&nbsp; 百 姓 对 扫 罗 说 ， 约 拿 单 在 以 色 列 人 中 这 样 大 行 拯 救 ， 岂 可 使 他 死 呢 ？ 断 乎 不 可 。 我 们 指 着 永 生 的 耶 和 华 起 誓 ， 连 他 的 一 根 头 发 也 不 可 落 地 ， 因 为 他 今 日 与 神 一 同 作 事 。 于 是 百 姓 救 约 拿 单 免 了 死 亡 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the people said to Saul, Is death to come to Jonathan, the worker of this great salvation for Israel? Let it not be so: by the living Lord, not one hair of his head is to be touched, for he has been working with God today. So the people kept Jonathan from death. 
<br>14:46 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 回 去 ， 不 追 赶 非 利 士 人 。 非 利 士 人 也 回 本 地 去 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Saul, turning back, went after the Philistines no longer: and the Philistines went back to their place. 
<br>14:47 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 执 掌 以 色 列 的 国 权 ， 常 常 攻 击 他 四 围 的 一 切 仇 敌 ， 就 是 摩 押 人 ， 亚 扪 人 ， 以 东 人 ， 和 琐 巴 诸 王 ， 并 非 利 士 人 。 他 无 论 往 何 处 去 ， 都 打 败 仇 敌 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now when Saul had taken his place as ruler of Israel, he made war on those who were against him on every side, Moab and the Ammonites and Edom and the kings of Zobah and the Philistines: and whichever way he went, he overcame them. 
<br>14:48 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 奋 勇 攻 击 亚 玛 力 人 ， 救 了 以 色 列 人 脱 离 抢 掠 他 们 之 人 的 手 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he did great things, and overcame the Amalekites, and made Israel safe from the hands of their attackers. 
<br>14:49 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 的 儿 子 是 约 拿 单 ， 亦 施 韦 ， 麦 基 舒 亚 。 他 的 两 个 女 儿 ， 长 女 名 米 拉 ， 次 女 名 米 甲 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan and Ishvi and Malchi-shua; and these are the names of his daughters: the older was named Merab and the younger Michal; 
<br>14:50 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 的 妻 名 叫 亚 希 暖 ， 是 亚 希 玛 斯 的 女 儿 。 扫 罗 的 元 帅 名 叫 押 尼 珥 ， 是 尼 珥 的 儿 子 。 尼 珥 是 扫 罗 的 叔 叔 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz; the captain of his army was Abner, the son of Ner, brother of Saul's father. 
<br>14:51 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 的 父 亲 基 士 ， 押 尼 珥 的 父 亲 尼 珥 ， 都 是 亚 别 的 儿 子 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Kish, the father of Saul, and Ner, the father of Abner, were sons of Abiel. 
<br>14:52 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 平 生 常 与 非 利 士 人 大 大 争 战 。 扫 罗 遇 见 有 能 力 的 人 或 勇 士 ， 都 招 募 了 来 跟 随 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; All through the life of Saul there was bitter war against the Philistines; and whenever Saul saw any strong man or any good fighting man, he kept him near himself.
