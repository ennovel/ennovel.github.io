<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now in those days the Philistines got their forces together to make war on Israel. And Achish said to David, Certainly you and your men are to go out with me to the fight. 
<br>28:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 对 亚 吉 说 ， 仆 人 所 能 作 的 事 ， 王 必 知 道 。 亚 吉 对 大 卫 说 ， 这 样 ， 我 立 你 永 远 作 我 的 护 卫 长 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And David said to Achish, You will see now what your servant will do. And Achish said to David, Then I will make you keeper of my head for ever. 
<br>28:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 时 撒 母 耳 已 经 死 了 ， 以 色 列 众 人 为 他 哀 哭 ， 葬 他 在 拉 玛 ， 就 是 在 他 本 城 里 。 扫 罗 曾 在 国 内 不 容 有 交 鬼 的 和 行 巫 术 的 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel, after weeping for him, had put his body in its last resting-place in Ramah, his town. And Saul had put away from the land all those who had control of spirits and who made use of secret arts. 
<br>28:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 非 利 士 人 聚 集 ， 来 到 书 念 安 营 。 扫 罗 聚 集 以 色 列 众 人 在 基 利 波 安 营 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the Philistines came together and put their forces in position in Shunem; and Saul got all Israel together and they took up their positions in Gilboa. 
<br>28:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 看 见 非 利 士 的 军 旅 就 惧 怕 ， 心 中 发 颤 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when Saul saw the Philistine army he was troubled, and his heart was moved with fear. 
<br>28:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 求 问 耶 和 华 ， 耶 和 华 却 不 借 梦 ， 或 乌 陵 ， 或 先 知 回 答 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when Saul went for directions to the Lord, the Lord gave him no answer, by a dream or by the Urim or by the prophets. 
<br>28:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 吩 咐 臣 仆 说 ， 当 为 我 找 一 个 交 鬼 的 妇 人 ， 我 好 去 问 她 。 臣 仆 说 ， 在 隐 多 珥 有 一 个 交 鬼 的 妇 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Saul said to his servants, Get me a woman who has control of a spirit so that I may go to her and get directions. And his servants said to him, There is such a woman at En-dor. 
<br>28:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 扫 罗 改 了 装 ， 穿 上 别 的 衣 服 ， 带 着 两 个 人 ， 夜 里 去 见 那 妇 人 。 扫 罗 说 ， 求 你 用 交 鬼 的 法 术 ， 将 我 所 告 诉 你 的 死 人 ， 为 我 招 上 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So Saul, putting on other clothing, so that he might not be seen to be the king, took two men with him and went to the woman by night; and he said, Now, with the help of the spirit which you have, make the person whose name I will give you come up. 
<br>28:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 妇 人 对 他 说 ， 你 知 道 扫 罗 从 国 中 剪 除 交 鬼 的 和 行 巫 术 的 。 你 为 何 陷 害 我 的 性 命 ， 使 我 死 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the woman said to him, But you have knowledge of what Saul has done, how he has put away out of the land those who have control of spirits and the users of secret arts: why would you, by a trick, put me in danger of death? 
<br>28:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 向 妇 人 指 着 耶 和 华 起 誓 说 ， 我 指 着 永 生 的 耶 和 华 起 誓 ， 你 必 不 因 这 事 受 刑 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul made an oath to her by the Lord, saying, By the living Lord, no punishment will come to you for this. 
<br>28:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 妇 人 说 ， 我 为 你 招 谁 上 来 呢 ？ 回 答 说 ， 为 我 招 撒 母 耳 上 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the woman said, Who am I to let you see? And he said, Make Samuel come up for me. 
<br>28:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 妇 人 看 见 撒 母 耳 ， 就 大 声 呼 叫 ， 对 扫 罗 说 ， 你 是 扫 罗 ， 为 什 么 欺 哄 我 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the woman saw that it was Saul, and she gave a loud cry, and said to Saul, Why have you made use of deceit? for you are Saul. 
<br>28:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 王 对 妇 人 说 ， 不 要 惧 怕 ， 你 看 见 了 什 么 呢 ？ 妇 人 对 扫 罗 说 ， 我 看 见 有 神 从 地 里 上 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the king said to her, Have no fear: what do you see? And the woman said to Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth. 
<br>28:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 说 ， 他 是 怎 样 的 形 状 。 妇 人 说 ， 有 一 个 老 人 上 来 ， 身 穿 长 衣 。 扫 罗 知 道 是 撒 母 耳 ， 就 屈 身 ， 脸 伏 于 地 下 拜 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said to her, What is his form? And she said, It is an old man coming up covered with a robe. And Saul saw that it was Samuel, and with his face bent down to the earth he gave him honour. 
<br>28:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 撒 母 耳 对 扫 罗 说 ， 你 为 什 么 搅 扰 我 ， 招 我 上 来 呢 ？ 扫 罗 回 答 说 ， 我 甚 窘 急 。 因 为 非 利 士 人 攻 击 我 ， 神 也 离 开 我 ， 不 再 借 先 知 或 梦 回 答 我 。 因 此 请 你 上 来 ， 好 指 示 我 应 当 怎 样 行 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Samuel said to Saul, Why have you made me come up, troubling my rest? And Saul in answer said, I am in great danger; for the Philistines are making war on me, and God has gone away from me and will no longer give me any answer, by the prophets or by dreams: so I have sent for you to make clear to me what I am to do. 
<br>28:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 撒 母 耳 说 ， 耶 和 华 已 经 离 开 你 ， 且 与 你 为 敌 ， 你 何 必 问 我 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Samuel said, Why do you put your questions to me, seeing that God has gone away from you and is on the side of him who is against you? 
<br>28:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 和 华 照 他 借 我 说 的 话 ， 已 经 从 你 手 里 夺 去 国 权 ， 赐 与 别 人 ， 就 是 大 卫 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to David: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the Lord himself has done what I said: the Lord has taken the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbour David; 
<br>28:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 因 你 没 有 听 从 耶 和 华 的 命 令 。 他 恼 怒 亚 玛 力 人 ， 你 没 有 灭 绝 他 们 ， 所 以 今 日 耶 和 华 向 你 这 样 行 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Because you did not do what the Lord said, and did not give effect to his burning wrath against Amalek. So the Lord has done this thing to you today. 
<br>28:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 并 且 耶 和 华 必 将 你 和 以 色 列 人 交 在 非 利 士 人 的 手 里 。 明 日 你 和 你 众 子 必 与 我 在 一 处 了 。 耶 和 华 必 将 以 色 列 的 军 兵 交 在 非 利 士 人 手 里 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And more than this, the Lord will give Israel up with you into the hands of the Philistines: and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me: and the Lord will give up the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines. 
<br>28:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 猛 然 仆 倒 ， 挺 身 在 地 ， 因 撒 母 耳 的 话 甚 是 惧 怕 。 那 一 昼 一 夜 没 有 吃 什 么 ， 就 毫 无 气 力 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Saul went down flat on the earth, and was full of fear because of Samuel's words: and there was no strength in him, for he had taken no food all that day or all that night. 
<br>28:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 妇 人 到 扫 罗 面 前 ， 见 他 极 其 惊 恐 ， 对 他 说 ， 婢 女 听 从 你 的 话 ， 不 顾 惜 自 己 的 性 命 ， 遵 从 你 所 吩 咐 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the woman came to Saul and saw that he was in great trouble, and said to him, See now, your servant has given ear to your words, and I have put my life in danger by doing what you said. 
<br>28:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 现 在 求 你 听 婢 女 的 话 ， 容 我 在 你 面 前 摆 上 一 点 食 物 ， 你 吃 了 ， 可 以 有 气 力 行 路 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So now, give ear to the voice of your servant, and let me give you a little bread; and take some food to give you strength when you go on your way. 
<br>28:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 不 肯 ， 说 ， 我 不 吃 。 但 他 的 仆 人 和 妇 人 再 三 劝 他 ， 他 才 听 了 他 们 的 话 ， 从 地 上 起 来 ， 坐 在 床 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But he would not, saying, I have no desire for food. But his servants, together with the woman, made him take food, and he gave way to them. So he got up from the earth, and took his seat on the bed. 
<br>28:24 [hgb]&nbsp; 妇 人 急 忙 将 家 里 的 一 只 肥 牛 犊 宰 了 ， 又 拿 面 抟 成 无 酵 饼 烤 了 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the woman had in the house a young cow, made fat for food; and she put it to death straight away; and she took meal and got it mixed and made unleavened bread; 
<br>28:25 [hgb]&nbsp; 摆 在 扫 罗 和 他 仆 人 面 前 。 他 们 吃 完 ， 当 夜 就 起 身 走 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And she put it before Saul and his servants, and they had a meal. Then they got up and went away the same night.
