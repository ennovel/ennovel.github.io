<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now the Philistines got their armies together for war, and came together at Socoh in the land of Judah, and took up their position between Socoh and Azekah in Ephes-dammim. 
<br>17:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 和 以 色 列 人 也 聚 集 ， 在 以 拉 谷 安 营 ， 摆 列 队 伍 ， 要 与 非 利 士 人 打 仗 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul and the men of Israel came together and took up their position in the valley of Elah, and put their forces in order against the Philistines. 
<br>17:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 非 利 士 人 站 在 这 边 山 上 ， 以 色 列 人 站 在 那 边 山 上 ， 当 中 有 谷 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The Philistines were stationed on the mountain on one side and Israel on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them. 
<br>17:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 从 非 利 士 营 中 出 来 一 个 讨 战 的 人 ， 名 叫 歌 利 亚 ， 是 迦 特 人 ， 身 高 六 肘 零 一 虎 口 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And a fighter came out from the tents of the Philistines, named Goliath of Gath; he was more than six cubits tall. 
<br>17:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 头 戴 铜 盔 ， 身 穿 铠 甲 ， 甲 重 五 千 舍 客 勒 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he had a head-dress of brass on his head, and he was dressed in a coat of metal, the weight of which was five thousand shekels of brass. 
<br>17:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 腿 上 有 铜 护 膝 ， 两 肩 之 中 背 负 铜 戟 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; His legs were covered with plates of brass and hanging on his back was a javelin of brass. 
<br>17:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 枪 杆 粗 如 织 布 的 机 轴 ， 铁 枪 头 重 六 百 舍 客 勒 。 有 一 个 拿 盾 牌 的 人 在 他 前 面 走 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The stem of his spear was as long as a cloth-worker's rod, and its head was made of six hundred shekels' weight of iron: and one went before him with his body-cover. 
<br>17:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 歌 利 亚 对 着 以 色 列 的 军 队 站 立 ， 呼 叫 说 ， 你 们 出 来 摆 列 队 伍 作 什 么 呢 ？ 我 不 是 非 利 士 人 吗 ？ 你 们 不 是 扫 罗 的 仆 人 吗 ？ 可 以 从 你 们 中 间 拣 选 一 人 ， 使 他 下 到 我 这 里 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; He took up his position and in a loud voice said to the armies of Israel, Why have you come out to make war? Am I not a Philistine and you servants of Saul? Send out a man for yourselves and let him come down to me. 
<br>17:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 若 能 与 我 战 斗 ， 将 我 杀 死 ， 我 们 就 作 你 们 的 仆 人 。 我 若 胜 了 他 ， 将 他 杀 死 ， 你 们 就 作 我 们 的 仆 人 ， 服 事 我 们 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; If he is able to have a fight with me and overcome me, then we will be your servants: but if I am able to overcome him, then you will be our servants and do work for us. 
<br>17:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 非 利 士 人 又 说 ， 我 今 日 向 以 色 列 人 的 军 队 骂 阵 。 你 们 叫 一 个 人 出 来 ， 与 我 战 斗 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the Philistine said, I have put to shame the armies of Israel this day; give me a man so that we may have a fight together. 
<br>17:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 和 以 色 列 众 人 听 见 非 利 士 人 的 这 些 话 ， 就 惊 惶 ， 极 其 害 怕 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul and all Israel, hearing those words of the Philistine, were troubled and full of fear. 
<br>17:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 是 犹 大 ， 伯 利 恒 的 以 法 他 人 耶 西 的 儿 子 。 耶 西 有 八 个 儿 子 。 当 扫 罗 的 时 候 ， 耶 西 已 经 老 迈 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah named Jesse, who had eight sons; and he was an old man in Saul's day, and far on in years. 
<br>17:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 西 的 三 个 大 儿 子 跟 随 扫 罗 出 征 。 这 出 征 的 三 个 儿 子 ， 长 子 名 叫 以 利 押 ， 次 子 名 叫 亚 比 拿 达 ， 三 子 名 叫 沙 玛 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the three oldest sons of Jesse had gone with Saul to the fight: the names of the three who went to the fight were Eliab, the oldest, and Abinadab the second, and Shammah the third. 
<br>17:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 是 最 小 的 。 那 三 个 大 儿 子 跟 随 扫 罗 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And David was the youngest: and the three oldest were with Saul's army. 
<br>17:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 有 时 离 开 扫 罗 ， 回 伯 利 恒 放 他 父 亲 的 羊 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now David went to and from Saul, looking after his father's sheep at Beth-lehem. 
<br>17:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 非 利 士 人 早 晚 都 出 来 站 着 ， 如 此 四 十 日 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the Philistine came near every morning and evening for forty days. 
<br>17:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 一 日 ， 耶 西 对 他 儿 子 大 卫 说 ， 你 拿 一 伊 法 烘 了 的 穗 子 和 十 个 饼 ， 速 速 地 送 到 营 里 去 ， 交 给 你 哥 哥 们 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Jesse said to his son David, Take now for your brothers an ephah of this dry grain and these ten cakes of bread, and go quickly with them to the tents to your brothers; 
<br>17:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 再 拿 这 十 块 奶 饼 ， 送 给 他 们 的 千 夫 长 ， 且 问 你 哥 哥 们 好 ， 向 他 们 要 一 封 信 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And take these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand, and see how your brothers are and come back with a sign to say how they are. 
<br>17:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 与 大 卫 的 三 个 哥 哥 和 以 色 列 众 人 ， 在 以 拉 谷 与 非 利 士 人 打 仗 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines. 
<br>17:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 早 晨 起 来 ， 将 羊 交 托 一 个 看 守 的 人 ， 照 着 他 父 亲 所 吩 咐 的 话 ， 带 着 食 物 去 了 。 到 了 辎 重 营 ， 军 兵 刚 出 到 战 场 ， 呐 喊 要 战 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And David got up early in the morning, and, giving the sheep into the care of a keeper, took the things and went as Jesse had said; and he came to the lines where the carts were, when the army was going out to the fight giving their war-cry. 
<br>17:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 色 列 人 和 非 利 士 人 都 摆 列 队 伍 ， 彼 此 相 对 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Israel and the Philistines had put their forces in position, army against army. 
<br>17:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 把 他 带 来 的 食 物 留 在 看 守 物 件 人 的 手 下 ， 跑 到 战 场 ， 问 他 哥 哥 们 安 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And David gave his parcels into the hands of the keeper of the army stores, and went running to the army and came to his brothers to get knowledge about them. 
<br>17:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 与 他 们 说 话 的 时 候 ， 那 讨 战 的 ， 就 是 属 迦 特 的 非 利 士 人 歌 利 亚 ， 从 非 利 士 队 中 出 来 ， 说 从 前 所 说 的 话 。 大 卫 都 听 见 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And while he was talking to them, the fighter, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came out from the Philistines' lines and said the same words, in David's hearing. 
<br>17:24 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 色 列 众 人 看 见 那 人 ， 就 逃 跑 ， 极 其 害 怕 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And all the men of Israel, when they saw him, went in flight, overcome with fear. 
<br>17:25 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 色 列 人 彼 此 说 ， 这 上 来 的 人 你 看 见 了 吗 ？ 他 上 来 是 要 向 以 色 列 人 骂 阵 。 若 有 能 杀 他 的 ， 王 必 赏 赐 他 大 财 ， 将 自 己 的 女 儿 给 他 为 妻 ， 并 在 以 色 列 人 中 免 他 父 家 纳 粮 当 差 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the men of Israel said, Have you seen this man? Clearly he has come out to put shame on Israel: and it is certain that if any man overcomes him, the king will give that man great wealth, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's family free in Israel. 
<br>17:26 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 问 站 在 旁 边 的 人 说 ， 有 人 杀 这 非 利 士 人 ， 除 掉 以 色 列 人 的 耻 辱 ， 怎 样 待 他 呢 ？ 这 未 受 割 礼 的 非 利 士 人 是 谁 呢 ？ 竟 敢 向 永 生 神 的 军 队 骂 阵 吗 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And David said to the men near him, What will be done to the man who overcomes this Philistine and takes away the shame from Israel? for who is this Philistine, a man without circumcision, that he has put shame on the armies of the living God? 
<br>17:27 [hgb]&nbsp; 百 姓 照 先 前 的 话 回 答 他 说 ， 有 人 能 杀 这 非 利 士 人 ， 必 如 此 如 此 待 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the people gave him this answer, So it will be done to the man who overcomes him. 
<br>17:28 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 的 长 兄 以 利 押 听 见 大 卫 与 他 们 所 说 的 话 ， 就 向 他 发 怒 ， 说 ， 你 下 来 作 什 么 呢 ？ 在 旷 野 的 那 几 只 羊 ， 你 交 托 了 谁 呢 ？ 我 知 道 你 的 骄 傲 和 你 心 里 的 恶 意 ， 你 下 来 特 为 要 看 争 战 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Eliab, his oldest brother, hearing what David said to the men, was moved to wrath against David, and said, Why have you come here? Into whose care have you given that little flock of sheep in the waste land? I have knowledge of your pride and the evil of your heart, you have come down to see the fight. 
<br>17:29 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 说 ， 我 作 了 什 么 呢 ？ 我 来 岂 没 有 缘 故 吗 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And David said, What have I done now? was it not only a word? 
<br>17:30 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 就 离 开 他 转 向 别 人 ， 照 先 前 的 话 而 问 。 百 姓 仍 照 先 前 的 话 回 答 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And turning away from him to one of the other men, he said the same words: and the people gave him the same answer. 
<br>17:31 [hgb]&nbsp; 有 人 听 见 大 卫 所 说 的 话 ， 就 告 诉 了 扫 罗 。 扫 罗 便 打 发 人 叫 他 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And, hearing what David said, they gave Saul word of it: and he sent for him. 
<br>17:32 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 对 扫 罗 说 ， 人 都 不 必 因 那 非 利 士 人 胆 怯 。 你 的 仆 人 要 去 与 那 非 利 士 人 战 斗 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart become feeble because of him; I, your servant, will go out and have a fight with this Philistine. 
<br>17:33 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 对 大 卫 说 ， 你 不 能 去 与 那 非 利 士 人 战 斗 。 因 为 你 年 纪 太 轻 ， 他 自 幼 就 作 战 士 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul said to David, You are not able to go out against this Philistine and have a fight with him: for you are only a boy, and he has been a man of war from his earliest days. 
<br>17:34 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 对 扫 罗 说 ， 你 仆 人 为 父 亲 放 羊 ， 有 时 来 了 狮 子 ， 有 时 来 了 熊 ， 从 群 中 衔 一 只 羊 羔 去 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And David said to Saul, Your servant has been keeper of his father's sheep; and if a lion or a bear came and took a lamb from the flock, 
<br>17:35 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 就 追 赶 它 ， 击 打 它 ， 将 羊 羔 从 它 口 中 救 出 来 。 它 起 来 要 害 我 ， 我 就 揪 着 它 的 胡 子 ， 将 它 打 死 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; I went out after him, and overcame him, and took it out of his mouth: and if, turning on me, he came at me, I took him by the hair and overcame him and put him to death. 
<br>17:36 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 仆 人 曾 打 死 狮 子 和 熊 ， 这 未 受 割 礼 的 非 利 士 人 向 永 生 神 的 军 队 骂 阵 ， 也 必 像 狮 子 和 熊 一 般 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Your servant has overcome lion and bear: and the fate of this Philistine, who is without circumcision, will be like theirs, seeing that he has put shame on the armies of the living God. 
<br>17:37 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 又 说 ， 耶 和 华 救 我 脱 离 狮 子 和 熊 的 爪 ， 也 必 救 我 脱 离 这 非 利 士 人 的 手 。 扫 罗 对 大 卫 说 ， 你 可 以 去 吧 。 耶 和 华 必 与 你 同 在 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And David said, The Lord, who kept me safe from the grip of the lion and the bear, will be my saviour from the hands of this Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go! and may the Lord be with you. 
<br>17:38 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 就 把 自 己 的 战 衣 给 大 卫 穿 上 ， 将 铜 盔 给 他 戴 上 ， 又 给 他 穿 上 铠 甲 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Saul gave David his clothing of war, and put a head-dress of brass on his head and had him clothed with a coat of metal. 
<br>17:39 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 把 刀 跨 在 战 衣 外 ， 试 试 能 走 不 能 走 。 因 为 素 来 没 有 穿 惯 ， 就 对 扫 罗 说 ， 我 穿 戴 这 些 不 能 走 ， 因 为 素 来 没 有 穿 惯 。 于 是 摘 脱 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And David took Saul's sword and put the band round him over the metal coat, and was unable to go forward; for he was not used to them. Then David said to Saul, It is not possible for me to go out with these, for I am not used to them. So David took them off. 
<br>17:40 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 手 中 拿 杖 ， 又 在 溪 中 挑 选 了 五 块 光 滑 石 子 ， 放 在 袋 里 ， 就 是 牧 人 带 的 囊 里 。 手 中 拿 着 甩 石 的 机 弦 ， 就 去 迎 那 非 利 士 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then he took his stick in his hand, and got five smooth stones from the bed of the stream and put them in a bag such as is used by sheep-keepers; and in his hand was a leather band used for sending stones: and so he went in the direction of the Philistine. 
<br>17:41 [hgb]&nbsp; 非 利 士 人 也 渐 渐 地 迎 着 大 卫 来 ， 拿 盾 牌 的 走 在 前 头 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the Philistine came nearer to David; and the man who had his body-cover went before him. 
<br>17:42 [hgb]&nbsp; 非 利 士 人 观 看 ， 见 了 大 卫 ， 就 藐 视 他 。 因 为 他 年 轻 ， 面 色 光 红 ， 容 貌 俊 美 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when the Philistine, taking note, saw David, he had a poor opinion of him: for he was only a boy, red-haired and good-looking. 
<br>17:43 [hgb]&nbsp; 非 利 士 人 对 大 卫 说 ， 你 拿 杖 到 我 这 里 来 ， 我 岂 是 狗 呢 ？ 非 利 士 人 就 指 着 自 己 的 神 咒 诅 大 卫 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you come out to me with sticks? And the Philistine put curses on David by all his gods. 
<br>17:44 [hgb]&nbsp; 非 利 士 人 又 对 大 卫 说 ， 来 吧 。 我 将 你 的 肉 给 空 中 的 飞 鸟 ， 田 野 的 走 兽 吃 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the Philistine said to David, Come here to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field. 
<br>17:45 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 对 非 利 士 人 说 ， 你 来 攻 击 我 ， 是 靠 着 刀 枪 和 铜 戟 。 我 来 攻 击 你 ， 是 靠 着 万 军 之 耶 和 华 的 名 ， 就 是 你 所 怒 骂 带 领 以 色 列 军 队 的 神 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then David said to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword and a spear and a javelin: but I come to you in the name of the Lord of armies, the God of the armies of Israel on which you have put shame. 
<br>17:46 [hgb]&nbsp; 今 日 耶 和 华 必 将 你 交 在 我 手 里 。 我 必 杀 你 ， 斩 你 的 头 ， 又 将 非 利 士 军 兵 的 尸 首 给 空 中 的 飞 鸟 ， 地 上 的 野 兽 吃 ， 使 普 天 下 的 人 都 知 道 以 色 列 中 有 神 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; This day the Lord will give you up into my hands, and I will overcome you, and take your head off you; and I will give the bodies of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth today, so that all the earth may see that Israel has a God; 
<br>17:47 [hgb]&nbsp; 又 使 这 众 人 知 道 耶 和 华 使 人 得 胜 ， 不 是 用 刀 用 枪 ， 因 为 争 战 的 胜 败 全 在 乎 耶 和 华 。 他 必 将 你 们 交 在 我 们 手 里 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And all these people who are here today may see that the Lord does not give salvation by sword and spear: for the fight is the Lord's, and he will give you up into our hands. 
<br>17:48 [hgb]&nbsp; 非 利 士 人 起 身 ， 迎 着 大 卫 前 来 。 大 卫 急 忙 迎 着 非 利 士 人 ， 往 战 场 跑 去 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now when the Philistine made a move and came near to David, David quickly went at a run in the direction of the army, meeting the Philistine face to face. 
<br>17:49 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 用 手 从 囊 中 掏 出 一 块 石 子 来 ， 用 机 弦 甩 去 ， 打 中 非 利 士 人 的 额 ， 石 子 进 入 额 内 ， 他 就 仆 倒 ， 面 伏 于 地 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone and sent it from his leather band straight at the Philistine, and the stone went deep into his brow, and he went down to the earth, falling on his face. 
<br>17:50 [hgb]&nbsp; 这 样 ， 大 卫 用 机 弦 甩 石 ， 胜 了 那 非 利 士 人 ， 打 死 他 。 大 卫 手 中 却 没 有 刀 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So David overcame the Philistine with his leather band and a stone, wounding the Philistine and causing his death: but David had no sword in his hand. 
<br>17:51 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 跑 去 ， 站 在 非 利 士 人 身 旁 ， 将 他 的 刀 从 鞘 中 拔 出 来 ， 杀 死 他 ， 割 了 他 的 头 。 非 利 士 众 人 看 见 他 们 讨 战 的 勇 士 死 了 ， 就 都 逃 跑 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So running up to the Philistine and putting his foot on him, David took his sword out of its cover, and put him to death, cutting off his head with it. And when the Philistines saw that their fighter was dead, they went in flight. 
<br>17:52 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 色 列 人 和 犹 大 人 便 起 身 呐 喊 ， 追 赶 非 利 士 人 ， 直 到 迦 特 （ 或 作 该 ） 和 以 革 伦 的 城 门 。 被 杀 的 非 利 士 人 倒 在 沙 拉 音 的 路 上 ， 直 到 迦 特 和 以 革 伦 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the men of Israel and of Judah got up, and gave a cry, and went after the Philistines as far as Gath and the town doors of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines were falling down by the road from Shaaraim all the way to Gath and Ekron. 
<br>17:53 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 色 列 人 追 赶 非 利 士 人 回 来 ， 就 夺 了 他 们 的 营 盘 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the children of Israel came back from going after the Philistines, and took their goods from the tents. 
<br>17:54 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 将 那 非 利 士 人 的 头 拿 到 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 却 将 他 军 装 放 在 自 己 的 帐 棚 里 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And David took the head of the Philistine to Jerusalem, but the metal war-dress and the arms he put in his tent. 
<br>17:55 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 看 见 大 卫 去 攻 击 非 利 士 人 ， 就 问 元 帅 押 尼 珥 说 ， 押 尼 珥 阿 ， 那 少 年 人 是 谁 的 儿 子 。 押 尼 珥 说 ， 我 敢 在 王 面 前 起 誓 ， 我 不 知 道 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the army, Abner, whose son is this young man? And Abner said, On your life, O king, I have no idea. 
<br>17:56 [hgb]&nbsp; 王 说 ， 你 可 以 问 问 那 幼 年 人 是 谁 的 儿 子 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the king said, Make search and see whose son this young man is. 
<br>17:57 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 卫 打 死 非 利 士 人 回 来 ， 押 尼 珥 领 他 到 扫 罗 面 前 ， 他 手 中 拿 着 非 利 士 人 的 头 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when David was coming back after the destruction of the Philistine, Abner took him to Saul, with the head of the Philistine in his hand. 
<br>17:58 [hgb]&nbsp; 扫 罗 问 他 说 ， 少 年 人 哪 ， 你 是 谁 的 儿 子 。 大 卫 说 ， 我 是 你 仆 人 伯 利 恒 人 耶 西 的 儿 子 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Saul said to him, Young man, whose son are you? And David in answer said, I am the son of your servant Jesse of Beth-lehem.
