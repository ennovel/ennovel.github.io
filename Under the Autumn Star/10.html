He chose Grindhusen to help him with the work, and I was set to cutting a way for the pipes up from the cellar through the two floors of the house.
<br> 
<br> Fruen came down one day when I was busy in the cellar. I called out to her to mind the hole in the floor; but she took it very calmly.
<br> 
<br> “There’s no hole there now, is there?” she asked, pointing one way. “Or there?” But at last she missed her footing after all, and slipped down into the hole where I was. And there we stood. It was not light there anyway; and for her, coming straight in from the daylight outside, it must have seemed quite dark. She felt about the edge, and said:
<br> 
<br> “Now, how am I to get up again?”
<br> 
<br> I lifted her up. It was no matter to speak of; she was slight of figure, for all she had a big girl of her own.
<br> 
<br> “Well, I must say. . . . ” She stood shaking the earth from her dress. “One, two, three, and up! — as neatly as could be. . . . Look here, I’d like you to help me with something upstairs one day, will you? I want to move some things. Only we must wait till a day when my husband’s over at the annexe; he doesn’t like my changing things about. How long will it be before you’ve finished all there is to do here?”
<br> 
<br> I mentioned a time, a week or thereabout.
<br> 
<br> “And where are you going then?”
<br> 
<br> “To the farm just by. Grindhusen’s fixed it up for us to go and dig potatoes there. . . . ”
<br> 
<br> Then came the work in the kitchen; I had to saw through the floor there. Fr?ken Elisabeth came in once or twice while I was there; it could hardly have been otherwise, seeing it was the kitchen. And for all her dislike of me, she managed to say a word or two, and stand looking at the work a little.
<br> 
<br> “Only fancy, Oline,” she said to the maid, “when it’s all done, and you’ll only have to turn on a tap.”
<br> 
<br> But Oline, who was old, did not look anyways delighted. It was like going against Providence, she said, to go sending water through a pipe right into the house. She’d carried all the water she’d a use for these twenty years; what was she to do now?
<br> 
<br> “Take a rest,” said I.
<br> 
<br> “Rest, indeed! We’re made to work, I take it, not to rest.”
<br> 
<br> “And sew things against the time you get married,” said Fr?ken Elisabeth, with a smile.
<br> 
<br> It was only girlish talk, but I was grateful to her for taking a little part in the talk with us, and staying there for a while. And heavens, how I did try to behave, and talk smartly and sensibly, showing off like a boy. I remember it still. Then suddenly Fr?ken Elisabeth seemed to remember it wasn’t proper for her to stay out here with us any longer, and so she went.
<br> 
<br> That evening I went up to the churchyard, as I had done so many times before, but seeing Fr?kenen already there, I turned away, and took myself off into the woods. And afterwards I thought: now she will surely be touched by my humility, and think: poor fellow, he showed real delicacy in that. And the next thing, of course, was to imagine her coming after me. I would get up from the stone where I was sitting, and give a greeting. Then she would be a little embarrassed, and say: “I was just going for a walk — it’s such a lovely evening — what are you doing here?” “Just sitting here,” say I, with innocent eyes, as if my thoughts had been far away. And when she hears that I was just sitting there in the late of the evening, she must realize that I am a dreamer and a soul of unknown depth, and then she falls in love with me. . . .
<br> 
<br> She was in the churchyard again the following evening, and a thought of high conceit flew suddenly into my mind: it was myself she came to see! But, watching her more closely, I saw that she was busy, doing something about a grave, so it was not me she had come for. I stole away up to the big ant-heap in the wood and watched the insects as long as I could see; afterwards, I sat listening to the falling cones and clusters of rowan berries. I hummed a tune, and whispered to myself and thought; now and again I had to get up and walk a little to get warm. The hours passed, the night came on, and I was so in love I walked there bare-headed, letting myself be stared out of all countenance by the stars.
<br> 
<br> “How’s the time?” Grindhusen might ask when I came back to the barn.
<br> 
<br> “Just gone eleven,” I would say, though it might be two or three in the morning.
<br> 
<br> “Huh! And a nice time to be coming to bed. Fansmagt! Waking folk up when they’ve been sleeping decently!”
<br> 
<br> And Grindhusen turns over on the other side, to fall asleep again in a moment. There was no trouble with Grindhusen.
<br> 
<br> Eyah, it’s over-foolish of a man to fall in love when he’s getting on in years. And who was it set out to show there was a way to quiet and peace of mind?
