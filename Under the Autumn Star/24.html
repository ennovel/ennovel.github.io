It was more than a trifle cold at first, and my woollen rug came in very handy; I used it alternately to put over my knees and wrap round my shoulders.
<br> 
<br> We drove the way I had walked up with Falkenberg, and I recognized place after place as we passed. There and there he had tuned the pianos; there we had heard the grey goose passing. . . . The sun came up, and it grew warmer; the hours went by; then, coming to cross-roads, the ladies knocked at the window and said it was dinner-time.
<br> 
<br> I could see by the sun it was too early for the ladies’ dinner-time, though well enough for me, seeing I took my dinner with Falkenberg at noon. So I drove on.
<br> 
<br> “Can’t you stop?” they cried.
<br> 
<br> “I thought . . . you don’t generally have dinner till three. . . . ”
<br> 
<br> “But we’re hungry.”
<br> 
<br> I turned off aside from the road, took out the horses, and fed and watered them. Had these strange beings set their dinner-time by mine? “V?rsaagod!”
<br> 
<br> But I felt I could not well sit down to eat with them, so I remained standing by the horses.
<br> 
<br> “Well?” said Fruen.
<br> 
<br> “Thank you kindly,” said I, and waited to be served. They helped me, both of them, as if they could never give me enough. I drew the corks of the beer bottles, and was given a liberal share here as well; it was a picnic by the roadside — a little wayfaring adventure in my life. And Fruen I dared look at least, for fear she should be hurt.
<br> 
<br> And they talked and jested with each other, and now and again with me, out of their kindliness, that I might feel at ease. Said Fr?ken Elisabeth:
<br> 
<br> “Oh, I think it’s just lovely to have meals out of doors. Don’t you?”
<br> 
<br> And here she said De, instead of Du, as she had said before.
<br> 
<br> “It’s not so new to him, you know,” said Fruen; “he has his dinner out in the woods every day.”
<br> 
<br> Eh, but that voice of hers, and her eyes, and the womanly, tender look of the hand that held the glass towards me. . . . I might have said something in turn — have told them this or that of strange things from out in the wide world, for their amusement; I could have set those ladies right when they chattered on, all ignorant of the way of riding camels or of harvest in the vineyards. . . .
<br> 
<br> I made haste to finish my meal, and moved away. I took the buckets and went down for more water for the horses, though there was no need. I sat down by the stream and stayed there.
<br> 
<br> After a little while Fruen called:
<br> 
<br> “You must come and stand by the horses; we are going off to see if we can find some wild hops or something nice.”
<br> 
<br> But when I came up they decided that the wild hops were over, and there were no rowan berries left now, nor any richly coloured leaves.
<br> 
<br> “There’s nothing in the woods now,” said Fr?kenen. And she spoke to me directly once again: “Well, there’s no churchyard here for you to roam about in.”
<br> 
<br> “No.”
<br> 
<br> “You must miss it, I should think.” And then she went on to explain to Fruen that I was a curious person who wandered about in graveyards by night and held meetings with the dead. And it was there I invented my machines and things.
<br> 
<br> By way of saying something, I asked about young Erik. He had been thrown by a runaway horse and badly hurt. . . .
<br> 
<br> “He’s better now,” said Fr?kenen shortly. — Are you ready to go on again, Lovise?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, indeed. Can we start?”
<br> 
<br> “Whenever you please,” I answered.
<br> 
<br> And we drove on again.
<br> 
<br> The hours pass, the sun draws lower down the sky, and it is cooler — a chill in the air; then later wind and wet, half rain, half snow. We passed the annexe church, a couple of wayside stores, and farm after farm.
<br> 
<br> Then came a knocking on the window of the carriage.
<br> 
<br> “Wasn’t it here you went riding one night on borrowed horses?” said Fr?kenen laughingly. “Oh, we know all about it, never fear!”
<br> 
<br> And both the ladies were highly amused.
<br> 
<br> I answered on a sudden thought:
<br> 
<br> “And yet your father would have me to take service with him — or wasn’t it so?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes.”
<br> 
<br> “While I think of it, Fr?ken, how did your father know I was working for Captain Falkenberg? You were surprised yourself to find me there.”
<br> 
<br> She thought quickly, and glanced at Fruen and said:
<br> 
<br> “I wrote home and told them.”
<br> 
<br> Fruen cast down her eyes.
<br> 
<br> Now it seemed to me that the young lady was inventing. But she put in excellent answers, and tied my tongue. It sounded all so natural; she writes an ordinary letter to her people at home, and puts in something like this: “And who do you think is here? The man who did those water-pipes for us; he’s felling timber now for Captain Falkenberg. . . . ”
<br> 
<br> But when we reached the vicarage, the new hand was engaged already, and there at work — had been there three weeks past. He came out to take the horses.
<br> 
<br> After that, I thought and thought again — why had they chosen me to drive them down? Perhaps it was meant as a little treat for me, as against Falkenberg’s being asked into the parlour to sing. But surely — didn’t they understand, these people, that I was a man who had nearly finished a new machine, and would soon have no need of any such trifles!
<br> 
<br> I went about sharp and sullen and ill-pleased with myself, had my meal in the kitchen, where Oline gave me her blessing for the water-pipes, and went out to tend my horses. I took my rug and went over to the barn in the dark. . . .
<br> 
<br> I woke to find some one touching me.
<br> 
<br> “You mustn’t lie here, you know; it’s simply freezing,” said Pr?stefruen. “Come with me, and I’ll show you. . . . ”
<br> 
<br> We talked of that a little; I was not inclined to move, and at last she sat down herself instead. A flame she was — nay, a daughter of Nature. Within her the music of a rapturous dance was playing yet.
