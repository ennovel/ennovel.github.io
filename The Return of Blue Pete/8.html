<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A hive of industry was below her--men and horses, huge tree trunks and masses of rock, network trestle and piled poles. Men swarmed everywhere, appearing from her height mere dots of movement, ridiculously unfit to cope with the force that was making her father so irritable these days.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Two distinct gangs were at work. Over beyond the water the filling in of the trestle was almost complete, the material being hauled by a train working from cuttings to the west. A great hundred-and-fifty foot bank of loose earth had swallowed the "crazy conthraption" to the very edge of the water, sloping steeply upward at its near side from the bridge that spanned the permanent course of the river. Everything hung now waiting only for the choking of the quicksand to commence the filling of the near side.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 From bank to bank of the river a heavy boom of logs caught the trees felled in the forest above and floated down for the great maw that had already swallowed so much. These trees, trimmed of all but their larger branches, were being drawn to the shore by the surer footed men and several teams of horses; the river bottom down there was a tangle of trunks ready to feed to the quicksands.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Closer in beneath the bank over which she looked men were piling rocks on the spongy area, as they had been for weeks--as they were a year ago under O'Connor--as they might be forever, unless luck favoured her father.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To the inexperienced eye the scene was ceaseless activity, but Tressa had long since learned the skill with which the bohunk conceals his laziness. A dozen civilised workmen would accomplish as much as three times their number of foreigners. But this was a bohunk's job; civilised workmen treated it as a plague.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The swift figure of Adrian Conrad moved from group to group, leaving a wake of energy. By sheer personality and grit he gained his ends, though railway construction was as foreign to his life's plans, past and future, as suicide.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She smiled as she thought of the reason of his presence, and blew a kiss over the edge to his unsuspecting head. This, the great task of her father's career, would mark the end of Conrad's apprenticeship. These days of a mass attack on the bottomless pit might be the beginning of the end. When the mass of logs and trees and rocks was dumped in, surely she could lay her plans for a new life! Conrad would return to the city, to the partnership he had dropped only temporarily to be near her; and her father would have enough for the rest of his days.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A week or two to test the success of their latest effort, another to build the permanent foundations and strengthen the trestle in its final shape, and then a few weeks at most for the fill-in. Already the wave in the trestle beneath the supply trains was scarcely noticeable. The end was in sight.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Her father she could pick out easily enough--that still, large figure standing by itself, or joined now and then by Adrian. Once it jerked forward, and half a dozen men catapulted themselves at some part of the work that did not please him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Presently Adrian and two others gathered before the contractor, where they seemed to confer a long time. One, Tressa knew, would be Koppowski; the other must be one of his friends, Werner probably, or Morani, or Heppel. They alone of the five hundred possessed intelligence enough to justify consultation. The rest merely obeyed orders, like the horses, and crammed their stomachs till the dishes were empty. Yes, and made strange music of evenings. She never understood that.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Then Adrian and her father were alone.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The men swarming through the lower lacework of the trestle were keying up with sledge and rope and wrench, adding a pole here and there. These they lifted by means of rope and pulley attached to convenient parts of the existing structure. Her father was pointing upward. A bohunk climbed clumsily to the point indicated and tied a pulley there. Passing a rope through the pulley, he tossed the end down. Several men seized it. To the other end a log was attached.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Down below, Torrance watched the carrying out of his orders with keenest interest. He had been at this for months, and his trained eye could pick out the weak spots with unerring instinct. To his eye he was forced to trust for the support of those twin bands of steel high above his head, since the uncertain and uneven sinking of the trestle, green timber, and ignorant and careless workmen, with the incidence of accident far above the average, made construction at the best patchy and haphazard.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He was surprised and a little chagrinned by the weakness he had discovered; he could not understand how it had escaped him before. The pull, the brace of the trestle poles just there did not seem unsound, yet instinct warned him that something was amiss in the sag of adjacent supports. His orders to Conrad, accordingly, were hurried and abrupt.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The men in the trestle went about the work in their usual clumsy way, but at last a score of men had hold of the rope and the fresh log rose on its end in slow jerks. Then it was clear of the ground, rolling in a leisurely way against the lower supports of the trestle in response to the uncurling of the rope. Up above, men were holding it away from the trestle; a dozen more waiting to fasten it in place.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 It had risen twenty feet when a cry of warning burst from Torrance's lips. He scarcely knew why. His wandering eyes had fancied a sag in the support that held the pulley; his quick ear had caught a new note in the creaking timbers.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 From above came the sound of snapping ropes--a chorus of panic-stricken cries--a succession of crashes as the two logs dashed earthward.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The swarthy man half way up, who had been directing the rising log, a task for which he was chosen on account of his great strength and cool judgment, turned a lightning backward somersault without pausing to look where he might land. As he turned over he twisted in the air, caught a support, and swung himself easily to safety. For a moment he contemplated the tragedy below, then like a cat sprang upward through the trestle. The others merely closed their eyes and hung on.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of the two freed logs the upper bounced from support to support, finally resting in the trestle itself. But the one that had been on its way to remedy the weakness turned slightly sideways and glanced off into the group of frozen bohunks below. The trestle trembled from end to end.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Torrance did not follow the course of the falling logs. All that mattered at such a moment was the fate of his great work. He saw the quiver run through it--felt it in his own body--heard the creaking of ropes and blots, and there flashed through him a horror that he had not provided for a strain like that. When the trestle held its place, a great surge of pride and joy swept over him, but his knees were trembling.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When his eyes returned to earth, the bohunks were in flight, almost to a man, though danger was past. Only Conrad, Koppy, and Lefty Werner were straining at the log that held down their crushed comrades. Torrance sprang forward and bent his great back to the weight. Two fewer bohunks were on construction in Canada.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Some one dropped from the trestle close to Torrance, and a hand thrust itself before the contractor's eyes. In the hand was the end of a rope. Torrance looked from it to the dusky Indian face above it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Cut!" jerked the halfbreed. "Thar's more up thar."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Torrance reached out slowly and took the rope, incredulous.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "'Twan't bolted," said the halfbreed. "An' then that."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A wave of crimson deepened the tan on Torrance's face. Whirling on the group beside him, he struck viciously, and Koppy hurtled over the log and lay as still as his dead companions. Instantly Conrad was on the Pole, running his hands swiftly over the unconscious body. With a satisfied smile he drew a knife from a leather sheath fastened inside the trouser-band, and thrust it into his own belt.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You did well to strike quickly," he muttered to Torrance. "A bullet would be the proper thing, but we've no direct proof; the Police would ask questions. He'll be round in a minute."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Torrance was examining the severed rope.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Where did you find this, Mavy?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The halfbreed pointed aloft. "Lower end o' the support the pulley was fastened to. Thar's more."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Torrance was restraining himself for lack of victims on whom to vent his wrath; Werner had retired to a discreet distance. Koppy was sitting weakly on the log, wondering what had happened. The contractor reached out one big hand and jerked him to his feet.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Now, you--! I'll give you twenty minutes to round up them cusses of yours and get them up in that trestle. The Indian here'll show you what you got to do. And you'll stand right under all the time--and you'll stand there every time we work on the trestle. I'm going to make it worth your skin to stop this thing. And if after to-day I find a rope cut or a bolt missing I'll smash you to pulp. And Big Jim Torrance don't go back on his word. . . . What's more, you and the other dogs won't be paid for the time it takes to fix things up."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He closed his powerful fist on the Pole's shoulder so tightly that the man's face twisted.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You think you're going to bust this job up, you and your gang. I'm telling you that before you succeed you'll wish you'd stayed in jail in your own country. I don't know what you got against the trestle, but I do know you're a hellish cuss I'm going to break to the halter. If you count to bust things up here, I'll see that the busting falls on your own head. Scat!"
