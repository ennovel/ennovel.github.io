THE CASH BOY'S PROMOTION.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      Cousin Seth arranged everything as he had planned, and Mrs. Mead's landlord, when he called, learned to his surprise that his poor tenant was intending to move.
<br> 
<br> "Have you found cheaper rooms?" he asked.
<br> 
<br> "No, but I am going to take a whole house."
<br> 
<br> The landlord looked astonished.
<br> 
<br> "Where?" he asked.
<br> 
<br> "On West Sixteenth Street."
<br> 
<br> "Yet you have always been pleading poverty, and only last month I had to wait two days for the last dollar of the rent."
<br> 
<br> "That is true; but an old friend has found me out, and will give me a helping hand."
<br> 
<br> Of course, no more was to be said.
<br> 
<br> The removal was soon made, for Mrs. Mead had little to move, and with Seth Lawton's efficient help, the widow found herself in possession of her[Pg 126] new establishment, with everything running smoothly.
<br> 
<br> "Now," said Mr. Lawton, "I must see if I can't do something for Willie. How much does Ezra Little pay him?"
<br> 
<br> "Two dollars and a half a week."
<br> 
<br> "That is too little."
<br> 
<br> "I don't think Mr. Little will pay more."
<br> 
<br> "Let him ask."
<br> 
<br> "I am afraid in that case he will lose his place. The last time Willie asked for a raise he was angry."
<br> 
<br> "Very well, if he loses his place I will find him another. Or, stay, I will ask Ezra myself."
<br> 
<br> "That will be better."
<br> 
<br> So Seth called the next evening on his rich relative. He was not received with open arms, for Mr. Little was under the impression that he wanted to borrow money.
<br> 
<br> "I can't give you much time to-night, Seth," said the merchant. "I have a business engagement. Have you found anything to do?"
<br> 
<br> "I think I can see my way clear to a place as confidential clerk and bookkeeper in a small office downtown."
<br> 
<br> "How much salary?"
<br> 
<br> [Pg 127]
<br> 
<br> "Possibly fifteen dollars a week."
<br> 
<br> "You had better accept. You are extremely lucky at your age to get such an office."
<br> 
<br> "You wouldn't be satisfied with it, Ezra," returned Seth, with a smile.
<br> 
<br> "I? You are dreaming. What, a well-known and long-established merchant to think of such a salary! You must be insane."
<br> 
<br> "Yet you are within five years as old as I am, Ezra."
<br> 
<br> "What does that matter? I take it there is considerable difference between your position and mine."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, I suppose so."
<br> 
<br> "To tell the truth, I didn't think you would be able to get any position at all. I hope this won't slip through your fingers."
<br> 
<br> "Then you advise me to accept it?"
<br> 
<br> "Of course. You would be crazy not to do so. Remember, you will have to depend upon yourself. The fact that you are a relation will not justify you in asking help from me."
<br> 
<br> "I have a favor to ask, however, Ezra."
<br> 
<br> "I cannot lend you money, if that's what you mean," said Ezra, brusquely.
<br> 
<br> "It isn't. I find that one of your cash boys is[Pg 128] the son of an old friend of ours—Mary Mead, formerly Mary Grant."
<br> 
<br> "Yes; I gave the boy a place in order to help her."
<br> 
<br> "You pay him two dollars and a half a week. There are only two boys, and this is very small."
<br> 
<br> "It is all I pay any of the boys."
<br> 
<br> "But Willie is a well-grown boy of fourteen. Surely, out of old friendship, and to help his mother, you can pay him more."
<br> 
<br> "Have you been talking to Mrs. Mead, and encouraged her to think that I will increase her boy's wages?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes."
<br> 
<br> "Then you have done a foolish thing. I decline. I am half inclined to discharge the boy."
<br> 
<br> "It won't be necessary. He will leave the store at the end of the week."
<br> 
<br> "What does this mean?"
<br> 
<br> "That I will undertake to find him a better place."
<br> 
<br> Ezra looked annoyed and angry.
<br> 
<br> "You can't do it," he said. "You have no acquaintances in the city. You are not even sure of employment yourself."
<br> 
<br> [Pg 129]
<br> 
<br> "So it seems you have sized me up, Ezra," said Seth Lawton, mildly.
<br> 
<br> "That is easy enough. You were born to be an unsuccessful man. You are fifty-six years old, and I suppose you haven't saved enough money to keep you going for three months."
<br> 
<br> "I don't owe a cent, Ezra."
<br> 
<br> "That is something. But I can't remain here talking. Don't forget what I said about making sure of the place you spoke of."
<br> 
<br> "Just as I expected," thought Seth. "Ezra seems to be a thoroughly selfish man. It is lucky for me that——" but he did not finish the sentence.
<br> 
<br> Mr. Little did not think of the matter again till the superintendent told him on Saturday night: "One of the cash boys has resigned his place."
<br> 
<br> "Who is it?"
<br> 
<br> "William Mead."
<br> 
<br> "It is all the bad advice of Seth Lawton," he reflected. "He is a perfect meddler. Probably his mother will be here in a day or two to beg me to take him back."
<br> 
<br> But no such application came. Willie had obtained a place on Grand Street at four dollars a week.
<br> 
<br> [Pg 130]
<br> 
<br> Scott continued to enjoy the companionship of Seth Lawton, but sometimes Cousin Seth was out of the city for days at a time, in which event Scott was thrown back on the company of Loammi, but this gave him very little satisfaction.
<br> 
<br> One evening Loammi happened upon his cousin coming out of a store on Sixth Avenue.
<br> 
<br> "Have you been buying anything?" he asked.
<br> 
<br> "Yes."
<br> 
<br> "What?"
<br> 
<br> "A couple of neckties."
<br> 
<br> "Where did you get the money?"
<br> 
<br> Scott said, quietly: "That is my business, Loammi."
<br> 
<br> "I thought you gave pa all the money you had."
<br> 
<br> "I gave him forty dollars."
<br> 
<br> "How much have you got left?"
<br> 
<br> "I don't care to tell."
<br> 
<br> This was enough for Loammi, who saw a chance to do his cousin an ill turn. Accordingly he said to his father that evening: "Pa, did you know that Scott had money?"
<br> 
<br> "What do you mean?"
<br> 
<br> Then Loammi told the story.
<br> 
<br> "I asked him how much he had, and he wouldn't[Pg 131] tell me. It seems to me he ought to have handed it to you."
<br> 
<br> In this Mr. Little agreed with his son.
<br> 
<br> "Call Scott," said he.
<br> 
<br> Scott was in his small chamber, and there Loammi found him.
<br> 
<br> "Pa wants to see you, Scott."
<br> 
<br> Scott went downstairs and into Mr. Little's presence.
<br> 
<br> "Do you wish to see me, sir?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes. Loammi tells me you have some money."
<br> 
<br> "Yes; I have a little money."
<br> 
<br> "I thought you gave up all you had when you came here."
<br> 
<br> "So I did, all but sixty cents, but I have regretted it since."
<br> 
<br> "Why?"
<br> 
<br> "Because I understood it was to be used for my clothing, and it was not."
<br> 
<br> "I told you in what light I considered it. But I won't dwell upon that now. You deceived me in letting me think you had given up all your money."
<br> 
<br> "No, I did not, sir."
<br> 
<br> "Then how do you explain your having money at present. Was it given you by Mr. Lawton?"
<br> 
<br> "No, sir."
<br> 
<br> [Pg 132]
<br> 
<br> "Where, then, did you get it?"
<br> 
<br> "It was money that I was swindled out of by a fellow passenger. I induced him to return a part of it."
<br> 
<br> "How much have you now?"
<br> 
<br> "About five dollars."
<br> 
<br> "You may give it to me."
<br> 
<br> "I prefer not to do so, Mr. Little; I need it myself."
<br> 
<br> Scott spoke respectfully, but firmly.
<br> 
<br> "Do you refuse?" demanded Ezra, angrily.
<br> 
<br> "Yes, sir."
<br> 
<br> "Do you think this is a suitable return for all I have done for you?"
<br> 
<br> "You have given me a home, but it is in return for services in your store. As for this money, it was given me by my father and I prefer to keep it."
<br> 
<br> Ezra Little was taken aback by the boy's resolute tone. On the whole, he decided not to press the demand.
<br> 
<br> "Be it so," he said; "but understand that I shall, hereafter, give you nothing but your board and lodging. When you require clothing or anything else, you must buy it yourself."
<br> 
<br> "I understand, sir."
<br> 
<br> [Pg 133]
<br> 
<br> "Seth has been talking to that boy," reflected Ezra Little. "It would serve him right for me to discharge him."
<br> 
<br> But Ezra Little knew that Scott was an excellent salesman, and that he could not supply his place at less than eight dollars a week, so he did not care to dismiss him.
<br> 
<br> "I'll bring him to terms yet," he said to himself.
