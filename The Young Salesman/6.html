SCOTT FINDS A RELATIVE AND A PLACE.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      Loammi Little, for this was the name of the red-haired boy, regarded Scott with curiosity mingled with surprise.
<br> 
<br> "What is your name?" he asked, abruptly.
<br> 
<br> "Scott Walton."
<br> 
<br> "I never heard of you, though I have heard pa say that a cousin of his married a man named Walton. Where is your father?"
<br> 
<br> "He is dead," answered Scott, sadly. "He died on the voyage over."
<br> 
<br> "Humph!" said Loammi, in a tone far from sympathetic. "I suppose you are poor."
<br> 
<br> "I am not rich," replied Scott, coldly.
<br> 
<br> He began to resent the unfeeling questions with which his cousin was plying him.
<br> 
<br> "If you have come over here to live on pa, I don't think he will like it."
<br> 
<br> "I don't want to live on anyone," said Scott, his[Pg 46] cheek flushing with anger. "I am ready to earn my own living."
<br> 
<br> "That's the way pa did. He came over here a poor boy, or rather a poor young man."
<br> 
<br> "I respect him the more for it."
<br> 
<br> "All the same I would rather begin life with a little money," said Loammi.
<br> 
<br> "I have a little money," rejoined Scott, with a half smile.
<br> 
<br> "How much?"
<br> 
<br> "I would rather wait and tell your father my circumstances."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, well, if you don't like to tell. Pa'll tell me all about it."
<br> 
<br> "That is as he chooses—but I would rather tell him first."
<br> 
<br> "How old are you?" asked Loammi, after a pause.
<br> 
<br> "Sixteen."
<br> 
<br> "So am I."
<br> 
<br> "Your father has a store on Eighth Avenue?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes; have you been in it?"
<br> 
<br> "Not yet. I only arrived in New York yesterday."
<br> 
<br> "Where are you living?"
<br> 
<br> "In a hotel on the Bowery."
<br> 
<br> [Pg 47]
<br> 
<br> "That isn't a fashionable street."
<br> 
<br> "So I judge; but I can't afford to board on a fashionable street."
<br> 
<br> "No, I suppose not. You are pretty well dressed, though."
<br> 
<br> "My father bought me this suit in London before we started for America. Are you working in your father's store?"
<br> 
<br> "No, I am attending school. I am not a poor boy, and don't have to work. Did you work any before you left the old country?"
<br> 
<br> "No, I was at school."
<br> 
<br> "Are you a good scholar?"
<br> 
<br> "That isn't for me to say. I stood very well in school."
<br> 
<br> "I am studying Latin and Greek," observed Loammi, proudly.
<br> 
<br> "I have studied them both," said Scott, quietly.
<br> 
<br> "How far were you in Latin?"
<br> 
<br> "I was reading Cicero's orations when I left school."
<br> 
<br> As this was considerably beyond the point to which Loammi had attained, he made no comment. He was considering what question to ask next, when his father entered the room.
<br> 
<br> There was a strong resemblance between father[Pg 48] and son. Ezra Little was a slender man, about five feet ten inches in height, with hair of a yellowish-red, inclined to be thin toward the top of the head.
<br> 
<br> There was a feeble growth of side whiskers extending halfway down each cheek. His eyes were of a pale blue, and his look was shrewd and cold.
<br> 
<br> He gazed inquiringly at Scott.
<br> 
<br> "This boy says his mother was your cousin, pa," exclaimed Loammi.
<br> 
<br> "What name?" asked Ezra.
<br> 
<br> "Scott Walton."
<br> 
<br> Ezra Little nodded.
<br> 
<br> "I see. Your father was an artist?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes."
<br> 
<br> "Where is he?"
<br> 
<br> "He died on the voyage over."
<br> 
<br> "Leaving you alone in the world?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes," answered Scott, sadly.
<br> 
<br> "Well, what are your plans?"
<br> 
<br> This question was asked coldly.
<br> 
<br> "My father died so lately that I haven't had time to form any plans. I thought I would like to consult you about them."
<br> 
<br> "I suppose you haven't much money?"
<br> 
<br> "No, sir."
<br> 
<br> [Pg 49]
<br> 
<br> "You have some?"
<br> 
<br> "About ten pounds."
<br> 
<br> "Fifty dollars."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, sir."
<br> 
<br> "And that is all?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, sir."
<br> 
<br> "That won't keep you long," said Loammi, disdainfully. "I s'pose you'll expect pa to take care of you."
<br> 
<br> "Have I hinted anything of the kind?" demanded Scott, indignantly. "I am young and strong, and I am quite ready to earn my own living. I don't want anybody to support me."
<br> 
<br> "Well spoken, lad!" said Ezra, in a tone of approval. "I'll think over your case. Loammi, tell your mother that Scott will stay to supper."
<br> 
<br> "Thank you, sir."
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Little was as plain in appearance as her husband and son, but Scott liked her better. She appeared to have a kindly disposition, and expressed sympathy for him when she heard of his father's death.
<br> 
<br> This was in contrast to Mr. Little and Loammi, upon whom it seemed to make no impression.
<br> 
<br> "And where are you staying, Scott?" she asked, in a tone of friendly interest.
<br> 
<br> [Pg 50]
<br> 
<br> "At a hotel on the Bowery."
<br> 
<br> "How much do they charge you?" inquired Ezra Little.
<br> 
<br> "Two dollars a day."
<br> 
<br> "It is very extravagant for a boy with your small stock of money to pay such a price."
<br> 
<br> "I know it, sir, but I only went there yesterday, I shall not think of staying."
<br> 
<br> Scott had decided not to mention his loss to Mr. Little, as he felt sure that it would bring upon him a reproof for his credulity in trusting a man of whom he knew so little as Crawford Lane.
<br> 
<br> "Why couldn't he come here, Ezra?" suggested Mrs. Little, turning to her husband.
<br> 
<br> Mr. Little coughed.
<br> 
<br> "After supper I shall speak to Scott about business," he said, "and that point will be discussed."
<br> 
<br> Scott looked forward to the interview with interest and anxiety. For him a great deal depended on it.
<br> 
<br> He hoped that Mr. Little would give him a place in the store where he would be in the line of promotion, and be able to earn his living.
<br> 
<br> He followed Mr. Little from the dining room into what might be called a library, though there[Pg 51] were only about fifty books in a small bookcase. There was a desk, however, used by Mr. Little for letter writing, and for the keeping of his accounts. Here, too, he received business visitors.
<br> 
<br> "Well," he said, pointing Scott to a chair, "now we will discuss your plans. You want a chance to work?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, sir."
<br> 
<br> "I may find a place for you in my store, but I warn you that you can't expect much pay to begin with."
<br> 
<br> "I don't expect much pay, sir. If I can earn enough to support myself it will satisfy me."
<br> 
<br> "Eh, but that would require high pay. It costs a good deal to support a boy in New York."
<br> 
<br> This rather alarmed Scott, for he felt that he must manage somehow to support himself on what he earned.
<br> 
<br> "We generally pay a beginner only three dollars a week," proceeded Mr. Little.
<br> 
<br> "Three dollars a week!"
<br> 
<br> Why, Scott was paying two dollars a day for board and lodging at the hotel.
<br> 
<br> He looked at Mr. Little in dismay.
<br> 
<br> "I shouldn't think I could support myself on three dollars a week," he said.
<br> 
<br> [Pg 52]
<br> 
<br> "We might strain a point and pay you three dollars and a half."
<br> 
<br> "Is there any boarding house where I could live on three dollars and a half?"
<br> 
<br> "Well, no; perhaps not; but you have some money, you tell me."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, sir, I have fifty dollars."
<br> 
<br> "Just at first you can use a part of that to supply deficiencies."
<br> 
<br> "I thought I might need that for clothes."
<br> 
<br> "Ahem!" said Mr. Little. "I have thought a way out of the difficulty."
<br> 
<br> Scott looked at him hopefully.
<br> 
<br> "I think Mrs. Little can find a small room for you upstairs, and you can live here."
<br> 
<br> "Thank you, sir."
<br> 
<br> "Of course what you earn in the store won't pay for your keep, so I suggest that you hand me the fifty dollars to make up."
<br> 
<br> Scott did not like that suggestion. He did not feel like giving up the money bequeathed him by his father. It would make him feel helpless and dependent.
<br> 
<br> Besides, when he wanted clothing, where should he find money to pay for it? Yet, if he declined Mr. Little's offer, he knew that the fifty dollars[Pg 53] would soon be exhausted, and he might have no other place offered him.
<br> 
<br> "When could I move here?" he asked.
<br> 
<br> "To-morrow, and on Monday morning, you can begin work at the store."
<br> 
<br> "Very well, sir."
<br> 
<br> "You can give me the money now."
<br> 
<br> "I will give you forty dollars, but I shall have to pay my hotel bill."
<br> 
<br> "You can keep five dollars for that. It will be sufficient."
<br> 
<br> So Scott handed over forty-five dollars to Mr. Little, who counted it over with evident satisfaction. Then the English boy started for the hotel.
<br> 
<br> He had secured a place, but somehow he felt depressed. His prospects did not seem very bright, after all.
