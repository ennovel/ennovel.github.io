EZRA LITTLE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      Arrived at the Gilsey House, Scott went into the reading room, thinking he might find Mr. Wood there. But he failed to see him.
<br> 
<br> "Whom are you looking for?" asked Edward Stripling, the telephone boy, who occupied one corner of the room.
<br> 
<br> "Mr. Wood."
<br> 
<br> "Perhaps you are the one he wanted to see. He told me to tell any one inquiring that he would be back in fifteen minutes."
<br> 
<br> "Then we shan't have to wait long, Mr. Babcock."
<br> 
<br> The inventor took up a paper from the table, but he was so nervous that he could not concentrate his attention upon it.
<br> 
<br> Ten minutes later Justin Wood entered the room.
<br> 
<br> "I am glad to see you, Scott," was his cordial greeting.
<br> 
<br> [Pg 194]
<br> 
<br> "Thank you, Mr. Wood. I come on business. Let me introduce Mr. Babcock."
<br> 
<br> "Glad to see you, Mr. Babcock," said Wood, courteously.
<br> 
<br> "Could we go up to your room? We won't keep you long."
<br> 
<br> "Certainly. Follow me."
<br> 
<br> Mr. Wood had a front room on the third floor a pleasant apartment, for which he paid a high rent.
<br> 
<br> "Now, Mr. Wood," began Scott, "I am going to ask your attention for ten minutes."
<br> 
<br> "I will give you fifteen, if necessary," said Wood, smiling.
<br> 
<br> Thereupon Scott told the story of the inventor, to which Justin Wood listened attentively.
<br> 
<br> "Have you a model of your invention?" he asked, turning to Babcock.
<br> 
<br> "Here it is, sir."
<br> 
<br> The young man asked various questions, which Babcock answered satisfactorily.
<br> 
<br> "I think well of your invention," said Mr. Wood, in conclusion. "Now, what do you want me to do?"
<br> 
<br> Scott answered.
<br> 
<br> "Mr. Babcock has exhausted all his means and[Pg 195] is penniless," he said. "The invention is perfected, but he is not in a position to put it before the public. He has, to be sure, received offers of assistance from a gentleman whom we both know."
<br> 
<br> "To whom do you refer?"
<br> 
<br> "Ezra Little."
<br> 
<br> "Indeed! Is that liberal gentleman willing to help him?"
<br> 
<br> "He offers me thirty-five dollars for the invention," said Babcock, bitterly. "I have spent a whole year in perfecting it, and this is to be my compensation."
<br> 
<br> "I think you had better not trouble Mr. Little," observed Justin, quietly. "How much money do you need to put it before the public?"
<br> 
<br> "If I had one hundred and fifty dollars," said the inventor, hesitatingly, "I think I could manage. I would be willing to sell a one-half interest for that sum."
<br> 
<br> "That would not be enough," said Wood, decidedly.
<br> 
<br> "With it I'd stand some chance of success."
<br> 
<br> "I will tell you what I will do. I will give you five hundred dollars for one-third interest, on condition that you work zealously to make it a success."
<br> 
<br> [Pg 196]
<br> 
<br> "Oh, sir, you are too generous," said Babcock, with emotion. "With that money I see my way clear."
<br> 
<br> "What would be your plan?"
<br> 
<br> "I can make arrangements with a responsible party to manufacture it, and will myself travel and put it before the public."
<br> 
<br> "I will risk it."
<br> 
<br> "I am sure, sir, that you will get your money back several times over."
<br> 
<br> "I hope so. I am not buying it for myself, but for a friend of mine."
<br> 
<br> Scott looked at him inquiringly.
<br> 
<br> "The friend is Scott Walton," he said, smiling. "Should it pay, I shall deduct the five hundred dollars from the first money received in the way of profit, and then make over the whole investment to you, Scott. I hope it may make you rich."
<br> 
<br> "How can I thank you, Mr. Wood?" said Scott, gratefully.
<br> 
<br> "Wait till you see whether you have anything to be grateful for."
<br> 
<br> "There is no doubt about that," said the inventor, confidently. "You will excuse me for saying, Mr. Wood, that I shall work even harder for my young friend Walton than I would for you."
<br> 
<br> [Pg 197]
<br> 
<br> "That is just what I wish. I am already rich, while Scott has his fortune yet to make."
<br> 
<br> "I will help him to make it."
<br> 
<br> "Come around to-morrow, Mr. Babcock, at ten o'clock, and I will have the money ready. We will also have papers regularly drawn up, so that Scott's share of the investment may be secured to him. And now, I shall have to bid you good-evening, as I have an engagement with a friend at the union League Club."
<br> 
<br> The two went out.
<br> 
<br> The inventor was fairly radiant.
<br> 
<br> "Mr. Walton," he said, "you don't know what you have done for me. You have given me a new lease of life. When I came to your room to-night I was in a mood that might have led me to throw myself from the Brooklyn Bridge. Mr. Little's cold-blooded letter had much to do with bringing on that mood. I felt that there was no hope for me."
<br> 
<br> "And now?"
<br> 
<br> "Now I have hope—and confidence. I have a presentiment of success. I shall make myself rich and you also."
<br> 
<br> "I hope your presentiment will prove prophetic," said Scott, smiling. "I can assure you that[Pg 198] a fortune will be welcome. At present I have only accumulated one hundred dollars."
<br> 
<br> "That is not bad for a young man of your age."
<br> 
<br> "Say a boy. I am not ashamed of being a boy."
<br> 
<br> "Remember I am speaking of my partner. I must speak of him with respect."
<br> 
<br> "Did I tell you I was going to leave the city for a time?"
<br> 
<br> "No. Why is it? You have not lost your place, I hope."
<br> 
<br> "No, I am going to travel for the firm. If I am lucky I shall soon earn an excellent income."
<br> 
<br> "You are sure to do that."
<br> 
<br> "How can you tell that I will succeed?"
<br> 
<br> "I was not referring to your regular position. I was thinking of your interest in my invention."
<br> 
<br> "You are confident, then, of success?"
<br> 
<br> "I am quite confident of it."
<br> 
<br> "I hope you are right; mostly, however, on your account, for I think my future is tolerably secure."
<br> 
<br> "I see you have no idea of the value of your interest in my enterprise."
<br> 
<br> "I shall not think seriously of it, but I will welcome any good that may come to me from it."
<br> 
<br> [Pg 199]
<br> 
<br> "My life will be changed," said Babcock. "I shall at once send for my little Molly."
<br> 
<br> "Is that your little daughter?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes."
<br> 
<br> "Where is she now?"
<br> 
<br> "In the country. Now, I shall feel justified in bringing her to the city. She is a sweet little girl."
<br> 
<br> "I am sure you will be happier for having her with you."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, you may well say that."
<br> 
<br> "By the way, have you answered Ezra Little's letter?"
<br> 
<br> "No; I shall answer it in person to-morrow, after I have concluded arrangements with your friend."
<br> 
<br> About two o'clock the next day, the inventor took his way to Ezra Little's dry-goods store on Eighth Avenue. He sent in his name and was admitted.
<br> 
<br> He was a welcome visitor, for Mr. Little, who was a practical man, had a fair conception of the value of his invention, and meant to make a fortune out of it—for himself. As for the poor inventor, he cared little for him.
<br> 
<br> Henry Babcock entered the merchant's presence, and was bidden to take a seat.
<br> 
<br> [Pg 200]
<br> 
<br> "I received a letter from you, Mr. Little," he said.
<br> 
<br> "Yes. I offered you thirty-five dollars for your invention."
<br> 
<br> "That seems to me very small."
<br> 
<br> "Probably it is more than I shall make out of it, but you seemed to be in need, and I am willing to help you."
<br> 
<br> "Don't you think, however, you could let me have more? Thirty-five dollars would not support me a month."
<br> 
<br> "It would give you time to look for a place, Mr. Babcock."
<br> 
<br> "But, Mr. Little, think of the time I have spent—and the money!"
<br> 
<br> "That does not concern me," said the merchant, coldly.
<br> 
<br> "I think I shall have to decline your offer."
<br> 
<br> "That is foolish. However, I will strain a point, and give you fifty dollars."
<br> 
<br> Henry Babcock shook his head.
<br> 
<br> "Mr. Little," he said, triumphantly, "I have sold a one-third interest in my invention for five hundred dollars."
<br> 
<br> Ezra Little looked amazed and disappointed. It was a chance of his life lost.
<br> 
<br> [Pg 201]
<br> 
<br> "What fool gave you that sum?" he asked, roughly.
<br> 
<br> "A Mr. Wood, to whom your cousin, Scott Walton, introduced me."
<br> 
<br> "Why didn't you tell me that at first?" snarled Ezra Little. "Wood must have been a fool to be influenced by that boy. Good-morning!"
