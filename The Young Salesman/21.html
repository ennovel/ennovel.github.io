A NEW PLACE.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      The house of Tower, Douglas &amp; Co. occupied a very high position in New York, and was known by reputation all over the country. The firm was liberal and considerate, and there were plenty of boys and young men who sought to enter their establishment.
<br> 
<br> Rich men sometimes offered the services of their sons, but Mr. Tower was never willing to accept them.
<br> 
<br> "A boy who works for nothing," he said, "is worth only what he receives. He loses his self-respect, and has no ambition to rise."
<br> 
<br> Generally, however, the wages paid to beginners were small, not over three or four dollars a week.
<br> 
<br> Of course it was impossible for Scott to live on such pay. Justin Wood was a relative of Mrs. Tower, and being personally liked by her husband, was the better able to secure favors.
<br> 
<br> [Pg 177]
<br> 
<br> When he obtained Scott's engagement he said: "Now as to the rate of compensation, Mr. Tower; how much are you willing to pay my young friend?"
<br> 
<br> "We usually pay three dollars a week. We will stretch a point and make it four in the case of young Walton."
<br> 
<br> "I want you to pay him ten dollars a week."
<br> 
<br> Mr. Tower looked amazed.
<br> 
<br> "Impossible!" he exclaimed. "You must be crazy."
<br> 
<br> "The boy is wholly dependent on what he earns."
<br> 
<br> "That may be; but I am under no obligation to support him."
<br> 
<br> "True," said Justin Wood, smiling, "but you may charge the extra six dollars to me."
<br> 
<br> "That will make a difference; but suppose our other employees find it out; then there will be dissatisfaction."
<br> 
<br> "Then let him understand that he is only paid ten dollars as a special favor to me, and that the arrangement must be kept strictly secret."
<br> 
<br> "That will do; but suppose he does not meet our expectations?"
<br> 
<br> "He will. You need be under no apprehensions.[Pg 178] I am something of a judge of boys, and I can assure you that he has a talent for business."
<br> 
<br> "I will take your word for it until I have a chance to judge for myself."
<br> 
<br> When Scott was informed that he would receive ten dollars a week he was delighted, and thanked Mr. Tower warmly.
<br> 
<br> "I am afraid I can't earn that sum, sir," he said.
<br> 
<br> "I know you can't," said the merchant, "but Mr. Wood is a cousin of my wife, and it is on his account that I pay you so liberal a salary. I expect you to work zealously so that you may deserve it."
<br> 
<br> "Thank you, sir; I will."
<br> 
<br> Scott spoke confidently, and Mr. Tower was pleased with his modest self-assurance.
<br> 
<br> "I don't think Justin is deceived in the boy," he said to himself. "At any rate, I will give him a fair chance."
<br> 
<br> Six months later, when Justin Wood called and asked how Scott was progressing, Mr. Tower said: "He is a born salesman. He is quick, shrewd, intelligent, and above all, he inspires confidence in customers. We will hereafter pay him ten dollars a week on our own account, and will not ask you[Pg 179] to reimburse us. But we will not raise him above that till the end of the year."
<br> 
<br> "That is perfectly satisfactory. I have only one favor to ask."
<br> 
<br> "What is that?"
<br> 
<br> "Send him on the road as soon as you consider him competent. I think he will make a successful drummer."
<br> 
<br> "That is my intention. Some of my salesmen can never go outside the store. Young Walton will make a good record outside."
<br> 
<br> Scott had been with the new firm for a month, when Seth Lawton returned from Chicago. He was much pleased at Scott's success, but understood very well that he was indebted for it to the friendly offices of Justin Wood.
<br> 
<br> "Do your best, Scott," he said. "You are at the bottom of the ladder, but you must climb. Your future depends on yourself. Do you ever see anything of Loammi?"
<br> 
<br> "I have met him two or three times. He seems surprised, and I think a little disappointed, at my success."
<br> 
<br> "Does he know how much you receive?"
<br> 
<br> "No; I promised to keep that a secret. But he knows that I live in a comfortable boarding house[Pg 180] on Lexington Avenue, and have a good room. If he knew I was paid ten dollars a week he would want to borrow money. His father has reduced his allowance to fifty cents a week, and he complains that he might as well be a newsboy. 'Don't you think the old man is mean?' he asked me yesterday."
<br> 
<br> "And what did you reply?"
<br> 
<br> "I told him that I didn't care to criticise his father."
<br> 
<br> "Good! I see you are discreet. What is Ezra going to do with his son? Will he train him up to business?"
<br> 
<br> "Loammi says he is going to Columbia College, or perhaps to Yale."
<br> 
<br> "He will never get there. He won't study hard enough."
<br> 
<br> "So I think, Cousin Seth. I wish I had the chance."
<br> 
<br> "Would you really like to go to college, Scott?" asked Seth Lawton, thoughtfully.
<br> 
<br> "No, I think not as I am at present situated. I could not enter before I am eighteen, and by that time I shall be well advanced in the knowledge of business."
<br> 
<br> "I think you are right, but I advise you to study,[Pg 181] and read instructive books in your leisure hours."
<br> 
<br> "I am doing that, Cousin Seth, and I am thinking soon of taking a commercial course in some business college."
<br> 
<br> "Do so, and I will pay the bill for tuition."
<br> 
<br> "I can afford to pay that myself, cousin. You are too generous. That is what keeps you poor."
<br> 
<br> Seth Lawton smiled.
<br> 
<br> "Oh, I am not so unselfish as you suppose," he said. "I make enough to live comfortably."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, Cousin Seth, but you ought to be saving up money. You are no longer a young man."
<br> 
<br> "I should think not, at fifty-five."
<br> 
<br> "And suppose you get sick, how are you to live?"
<br> 
<br> "Don't you think Ezra Little would take care of me?"
<br> 
<br> Scott laughed.
<br> 
<br> "I am afraid not," he answered; "but you have another relative who would be glad to help you."
<br> 
<br> "Meaning yourself."
<br> 
<br> "Yes."
<br> 
<br> "Good boy!" said Seth, and he looked moved. "Yes, I think you would be willing to help me if I were in need, but at present you have only enough for yourself."
<br> 
<br> [Pg 182]
<br> 
<br> "I am saving a little money, cousin."
<br> 
<br> "What! Out of ten dollars a week?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes; ten dollars a week is quite a liberal salary."
<br> 
<br> "You are right. It will do you no harm to be economical. By the way, has Ezra Little never returned to you the forty dollars you placed in his hands?"
<br> 
<br> "No."
<br> 
<br> "You should ask him for it."
<br> 
<br> "I would rather not," said Scott, shrinking.
<br> 
<br> "But it is rightfully yours. He has no excuse for keeping it."
<br> 
<br> "I don't think I would like to speak to him on the subject," said Scott, thoughtfully.
<br> 
<br> "Then I will."
<br> 
<br> In fact, Mr. Lawton lost no time in doing as he proposed. He called at Ezra Little's house and broached the subject.
<br> 
<br> "Ezra," he said, "I understand that you have forty dollars belonging to Scott."
<br> 
<br> "I don't look upon it in that light," said Mr. Little. "I gave the boy a place in my store."
<br> 
<br> "And all you gave him was his board."
<br> 
<br> "True; but that was more than he earned."
<br> 
<br> "I don't agree with you. It strikes me, Ezra,[Pg 183] that it is small business to take the boy's small capital and appropriate it to your own use."
<br> 
<br> Ezra Little looked incensed.
<br> 
<br> "Mr. Lawton," he said, "it strikes me that your interference is impertinent."
<br> 
<br> "On the contrary, as Scott has no one else to speak up for him, I consider that, as his near relative, it is my duty to do it."
<br> 
<br> "If you had attended to your own affairs, instead of meddling with others, you would not be in danger of going to the poorhouse, as you are at present."
<br> 
<br> "Am I?" asked Seth, looking amused. "You seem to know a good deal about my affairs."
<br> 
<br> "I don't suppose you have a hundred dollars in the world. If you should be in need you mustn't expect me to help you."
<br> 
<br> "I shall not. You are pretty safe on that score, Ezra."
<br> 
<br> "I see you are poor and proud. However, I am glad to hear it."
<br> 
<br> "Then suppose we return to Scott's money. Are you prepared to give it back?"
<br> 
<br> "No, I am not."
<br> 
<br> "I don't think it will do you any good. Robbing the orphan——"
<br> 
<br> [Pg 184]
<br> 
<br> "Mr. Lawton, I will not submit to such insinuations. If Scott should lose his position, as he is likely to do if he is guided by your advice, I will help him out of the money in my hands."
<br> 
<br> "Very well; I will hold you to that. However, I don't think he is likely to be placed in that predicament."
<br> 
<br> "How much does he receive from Tower, Douglas &amp; Co.?"
<br> 
<br> "More than you paid him. However, I will not occupy any more of your time. If you become ashamed of your meanness, you can let me know."
<br> 
<br> "Seth Lawton, I won't stand any more of your impertinence. You appear to forget who I am."
<br> 
<br> "I am not likely to forget who and what you are, Ezra. Good-evening!"
<br> 
<br> "The beggar!" soliloquized the merchant. "He need never expect any favors from me. He will yet repent his impertinence."
