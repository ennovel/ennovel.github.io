AT NIAGARA FALLS.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      On his way back from Cleveland, Scott, having the necessary leisure, stopped a couple of days at Niagara Falls. He registered his name at the Clifton House, on the Canada side.
<br> 
<br> He lost no time in visiting the objects of interest connected with the falls, and at the close of the first day sat on the piazza, with the falls in sight.
<br> 
<br> A blond-bearded young man of perhaps twenty-five, evidently an Englishman, sat near by. He looked at Scott once or twice, as if tempted to speak, but a certain reticence characteristic of his countrymen appeared to prevent.
<br> 
<br> Scott observed this, and made a remark by way of opening a conversation.
<br> 
<br> "Yes," answered the young man, "you are right. The falls are grand. You Americans ought to be very proud of them."
<br> 
<br> "But," said Scott, smiling, "I am not an American."
<br> 
<br> The Englishman looked surprised, for Scott,[Pg 211] though he had only been in America a year, had come to resemble the people among whom he had cast his lot.
<br> 
<br> "What, then, are you?" inquired his new acquaintance, looking puzzled.
<br> 
<br> "I was born in England."
<br> 
<br> "Indeed!" said the other. "Then we are countrymen."
<br> 
<br> "I am glad to know it," said Scott, courteously.
<br> 
<br> "How long have you been in America, if I may ask?"
<br> 
<br> "A little more than a year."
<br> 
<br> "And do you live in Canada?"
<br> 
<br> "No, I live in New York."
<br> 
<br> "You are not—in business?" queried the Englishman, noticing his youthful appearance.
<br> 
<br> "Oh, yes, I am employed by a New York firm."
<br> 
<br> "But how do you happen—excuse my asking—to be here? But perhaps it is your vacation."
<br> 
<br> "No, I am traveling for the firm. I am a traveling salesman for the house of Tower, Douglas &amp; Co."
<br> 
<br> "That is a large firm, I have heard."
<br> 
<br> "One of the largest in New York."
<br> 
<br> "I confess I am puzzled. You occupy such a responsible position, and yet you are so young."
<br> 
<br> [Pg 212]
<br> 
<br> "I believe my case is exceptional. I am the youngest traveler for our house."
<br> 
<br> "I rejoice in your success, since you are an English boy. May I ask your name?"
<br> 
<br> Scott handed his new acquaintance a card like this:
<br> 
<br> SCOTT WALTON
<br> 
<br> Representing
<br> 
<br> Tower, Douglas &amp; Co.
<br> 
<br> NEW YORK.
<br> 
<br> "Thank you," said the other.
<br> 
<br> He took from his pocket a card, from which Scott learned that he was Lord Cecil Grant, Earl of Windermere.
<br> 
<br> "I am honored in making your acquaintance," said Scott. "May I say that you seem young to be an earl? I fancied all earls were at least fifty years of age."
<br> 
<br> "I wish that I had waited till fifty for my title," said the young Englishman, gravely; "but my poor father died suddenly, six months ago, and partly to dissipate my grief I came to America."
<br> 
<br> "Have you been here long, my lord?" asked Scott, not knowing exactly how to address his distinguished companion.
<br> 
<br> "Never mind the title," said the earl, smiling.
<br> 
<br> [Pg 213]
<br> 
<br> "It comes awkwardly to an American to use it, and you are already half an American."
<br> 
<br> "What shall I call you, then?"
<br> 
<br> "You may call me Mr. Grant, if you like. If you come to know me better, you may call me Cecil. I shall take the liberty, since you are a boy, to call you Scott."
<br> 
<br> As he spoke there was a winning smile upon his face, and Scott felt that he should like him.
<br> 
<br> "I will try to forget that you are an earl," he said, "and then I shall feel more at home with you."
<br> 
<br> "What do you say to a walk, Scott? The evening is too fine to spend here."
<br> 
<br> "I shall be delighted."
<br> 
<br> He put on his hat, and the two sauntered off together. They were both good walkers, and had covered several miles before they returned to the hotel.
<br> 
<br> "I wish I had met you before, Scott," said the earl, familiarly. "Won't you tell me something about yourself, and your history? I am sure you have one."
<br> 
<br> Almost before he knew it, Scott had told the story already familiar to the reader. The earl listened with evident interest.
<br> 
<br> [Pg 214]
<br> 
<br> "Really," he said, "it is worthy of telling in book form. That uncle of yours——"
<br> 
<br> "My mother's cousin," corrected Scott.
<br> 
<br> "No matter. We will say relative. He must certainly be a mean, disagreeable fellow, don't you know, and as to your cousin with the peculiar name——"
<br> 
<br> "Loammi."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, I never heard the name before. Well, he must be a cad."
<br> 
<br> "I think he is," said Scott, smiling; "but I assure you he considers himself infinitely above me."
<br> 
<br> "I shall not ask you for an introduction."
<br> 
<br> "He would like nothing better than to become acquainted with you, Mr. Grant."
<br> 
<br> "You compliment me. Well, here we are at the hotel. What are your plans for to-morrow? I hope you do not leave in the morning?"
<br> 
<br> "No; I shall spend another day here."
<br> 
<br> "Why not spend it together?"
<br> 
<br> "I should like nothing better," said Scott, sincerely.
<br> 
<br> "Then we will do so. I will secure a carriage in the morning, and we will make a day of it."
<br> 
<br> He was as good as his word, and Scott had a delightful time. He almost succeeded in forgetting[Pg 215] his companion's rank, and found him a congenial companion.
<br> 
<br> Just after supper, when the earl had gone up to his room, a pretentious-looking man of middle age, who seemed to be continually trying to assert his claim to superiority, came up to Scott.
<br> 
<br> "Boy," he said, "I understand there is an English earl staying at the hotel?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, sir. It is the Earl of Windermere."
<br> 
<br> "Have you seen him? Could you point him out to me?"
<br> 
<br> "He has gone up to his room, but will probably be back almost immediately."
<br> 
<br> "How shall I know him?"
<br> 
<br> "He will come up and speak to me, and then we shall probably go out to walk together."
<br> 
<br> "Are you a friend of the earl?" asked Mr. Burton, in surprise.
<br> 
<br> "I think I may call myself so. We have been together all day."
<br> 
<br> Mr. Burton regarded Scott with new respect. He had unceremoniously called him "boy," but it was before he knew that he was a friend of an earl.
<br> 
<br> "Would you kindly introduce me?" he asked, eagerly.
<br> 
<br> [Pg 216]
<br> 
<br> "I am not quite sure whether he would be willing," returned Scott, with hesitation.
<br> 
<br> "Would you mind asking him?"
<br> 
<br> "If you will let me know your name, sir."
<br> 
<br> "I am Nathan Burton, of Albany. I have been an alderman," said the other, consequentially.
<br> 
<br> "I hope you may yet be mayor," answered Scott, amused.
<br> 
<br> "Stranger things have happened," rejoined Mr. Burton, complacently. "Did you come over with the earl?"
<br> 
<br> "A year earlier," returned Scott, gravely.
<br> 
<br> From this Mr. Burton inferred that they had been friends on the other side.
<br> 
<br> "And your name is——"
<br> 
<br> "Scott Walton."
<br> 
<br> "An aristocratic name!" thought the Albany alderman. "Are you related to the earl?"
<br> 
<br> "No, sir. We are only friends."
<br> 
<br> At this moment the earl entered the room, and at once went up to Scott.
<br> 
<br> "Are you ready for a walk, Scott?" he asked.
<br> 
<br> "Yes, but first——" And here in a low voice Scott communicated Mr. Burton's request.
<br> 
<br> The earl looked around at the alderman and seemed amused.
<br> 
<br> [Pg 217]
<br> 
<br> "Very well," he said, smiling.
<br> 
<br> At a signal, Mr. Burton approached.
<br> 
<br> "My lord," said Scott, formally, "allow me to present Mr. Alderman Burton, of Albany."
<br> 
<br> Mr. Burton bowed profoundly.
<br> 
<br> "I am glad to become acquainted with a representative American," said the earl, in a dignified voice, quite different from his tone in talking with Scott.
<br> 
<br> "My lord earl, I feel very much honored to make your acquaintance," said Mr. Burton, with another profound bow.
<br> 
<br> "I believe you Americans have no titles," said the earl.
<br> 
<br> "No, my lord; but I should be in favor of having them."
<br> 
<br> "In that case, you might become Earl of Albany."
<br> 
<br> "You do me proud, indeed you do, my lord," said the gratified alderman.
<br> 
<br> "I am sorry to leave you so soon, but my young friend and I propose to have a walk."
<br> 
<br> "Don't let me detain you, my lord. If I might dare to ask one favor——"
<br> 
<br> "What is it, sir?"
<br> 
<br> "If you would favor me with your card?"
<br> 
<br> [Pg 218]
<br> 
<br> With a smile, the earl produced the coveted bit of pasteboard and handed it to the alderman.
<br> 
<br> When they were fairly out of the hotel, both laughed merrily.
<br> 
<br> "Do you want me to be as respectful as Mr. Alderman Burton?" asked Scott.
<br> 
<br> "No, be yourself, Scott. That will suit me better."
