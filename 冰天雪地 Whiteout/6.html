<p>MIRANDA OXENFORD ordered a cappuccino Viennoise, with a pyramid of whipped cream on top. At the last moment she asked for a piece of carrot cake as well. She stuffed her change into the pocket of her skirt and carried her breakfast to the table where her thin sister Olga was seated with a double espresso and a cigarette. The place was bedecked with paper chains, and a Christmas tree twinkled over the panini toaster, but someone with a nice sense of irony had put the Beach Boys on the music system, and they were singing "Surfin' USA."</p> 
<p>Miranda often ran into Olga first thing in the morning at this coffee bar in Sauchiehall Street, in the center of Glasgow. They worked nearby: Miranda was managing director of a recruitment agency specializing in IT personnel, and Olga was an advocate. They both liked to take five minutes to gather their thoughts before going into their offices.</p> 
<p>They did not look like sisters, Miranda thought, catching a glimpse of her reflection in a mirror. She was short, with curly blond hair, and her figure was, well, cuddly. Olga was tall like Daddy, but she had the same black eyebrows as their late mother, who had been Italian by birth and was always called Mamma Marta. Olga was dressed for work in a dark gray suit and sharply pointed shoes. She could have played the part of Cruella De Vil. She probably terrified juries.</p> 
<p>Miranda took off her coat and scarf. She wore a pleated skirt and a sweater embroidered with small flowers. She dressed to charm, not to intimidate. As she sat down, Olga said, "You're working on Christmas Eve?"</p> 
<p>"Just for an hour," Miranda replied. "To make sure nothing's left undone over the holiday."</p> 
<p>"Same here."</p> 
<p>"Have you heard the news? A technician at the Kremlin died of a</p> 
<p>virus."</p> 
<p>"Oh, God, that's going to blight our Christmas."</p> 
<p>Olga could seem heartless, but she was not really so, Miranda thought. "It was on the radio. I haven't spoken to Daddy yet, but it seems the poor boy became fond of a lab hamster and took it home."</p> 
<p>"What did he do, have sex with it?"</p> 
<p>"It probably bit him. He lived alone, so nobody called for help. At least that means he probably didn't pass the virus to anyone else. All the same, it's awful for Daddy. He won't show it, but he's sure to feel responsible."</p> 
<p>"He should have gone in for a less hazardous branch of science— something like atomic weapons research."</p> 
<p>Miranda smiled. She was especially pleased to see Olga today. She was glad of the chance of a quiet word. The whole family was about to gather at Steepfall, their father's house, for Christmas. She was bringing her fiance, Ned Hanley, and she wanted to make sure Olga would be nice to him. But she approached the subject in a roundabout way. "I hope this doesn't spoil the holiday. I've been looking forward to it so much. You know Kit's coming?"</p> 
<p>"I'm deeply sensible of the honor our little brother is doing us."</p> 
<p>"He wasn't going to come, but I talked him round."</p> 
<p>"Daddy will be pleased." Olga spoke with a touch of sarcasm.</p> 
<p>"He will, actually," Miranda said reproachfully. "You know it broke his heart to fire Kit."</p> 
<p>"I know I've never seen him so angry. I thought he would kill someone."</p> 
<p>"Then he cried."</p> 
<p>"I didn't see that."</p> 
<p>"Nor did I. Lori told me." Lori was Stanley's housekeeper. "But now he wants to forgive and forget."</p> 
<p>Olga stubbed her cigarette. "I know. Daddy's magnanimity is boundless. Does Kit have a job yet?"</p> 
<p>"No."</p> 
<p>"Can't you find him something? It's your field, and he's good."</p> 
<p>"Things are quiet—and people know he was sacked by his father."</p> 
<p>"Has he stopped gambling?"</p> 
<p>"He must have. He promised Daddy he would. And he's got no money."</p> 
<p>"Daddy paid his debts, didn't he?"</p> 
<p>"I don't think we're supposed to know."</p> 
<p>"Come on, Mandy." Olga was using Miranda's childhood name. "How much?"</p> 
<p>"You should ask Daddy—or Kit."</p> 
<p>"Was it ten thousand pounds?"</p> 
<p>Miranda looked away.</p> 
<p>"More than that? Twenty?"</p> 
<p>Miranda whispered, "Fifty."</p> 
<p>"Good God! That little bastard pissed away fifty grand of our inheritance? Wait till I see him."</p> 
<p>"Anyway, enough of Kit. You're going to get to know Ned much better this Christmas. I want you to treat him as one of the family."</p> 
<p>"Ned should be one of the family by now. When are you getting married? You're too old for a long engagement. You've both been married before—it's not as if you have to save up for your trousseau."</p> 
<p>This was not the response Miranda was hoping for. She wanted Olga to feel warm toward Ned. "Oh, you know what Ned's like," she said defensively. "He's lost in his own world." Ned was editor of The Glasgow Review of Books, a respected cultural-political journal, but he was not practical.</p> 
<p>"I don't know how you stand it. I can't abide vacillation."</p> 
<p>The conversation was not going the way Miranda wanted. "Believe me, it's a blessed relief after Jasper." Miranda's first husband had been a bully and a tyrant. Ned was the opposite, and that was one of the reasons she loved him. "Ned will never be organized enough to boss me around— half the time he can't remember what day it is."</p> 
<p>"Still, you managed perfectly well without a man for five years."</p> 
<p>"I did, and I was proud of myself, especially when the economy turned down and they stopped paying me those big bonuses."</p> 
<p>"So why do you want another man?"</p> 
<p>"Well, you know ..."</p> 
<p>"Sex? Oh, please. Haven't you heard of vibrators?"</p> 
<p>Miranda giggled. "It's not the same."</p> 
<p>"Indeed it's not. A vibrator is bigger and harder and more reliable and, when you're done with it, you can put it back in the bedside table and forget about it."</p> 
<p>Miranda began to feel attacked, as often happened when she talked to her sister. "Ned's very good with Tom," she said. Tom was her eleven-year-old son. "Jasper hardly ever spoke to Tom, except to give him orders. Ned takes an interest in him—asks him questions and listens to the answers."</p> 
<p>"Speaking of stepchildren, how does Tom get along with Sophie?" Ned's daughter by his first marriage was fourteen.</p> 
<p>"She's coming to Steepfall, too—I'm picking her up later this morning. Tom looks at Sophie the way the Greeks regarded the gods, as supernatural beings who are dangerous unless pacified by constant sacrifices. He's always trying to give her sweets. She'd rather have cigarettes. She's as thin as a stick and prepared to die to stay that way." Miranda looked pointedly at Olga's pack of Marlboro Lights.</p> 
<p>"We all have our weaknesses," said Olga. "Have some more carrot cake."</p> 
<p>Miranda put down her fork and took a sip of coffee. "Sophie can be difficult, but it's not her fault. Her mother resents me, and the child is bound to pick up that attitude."</p> 
<p>"I bet Ned leaves you to deal with the problem."</p> 
<p>"I don't mind."</p> 
<p>"Now that he's living in your flat, does he pay you rent?"</p> 
<p>"He can't afford it. That magazine pays peanuts. And he's still carrying the mortgage on the house his ex lives in. He's not comfortable about being financially dependent, believe you me."</p> 
<p>"I can't think why he wouldn't be comfortable. He can have a bonk whenever he feels like it, he's got you to look after his difficult daughter, and he's living rent-free."</p> 
<p>Miranda was hurt. "That's a bit harsh."</p> 
<p>"You shouldn't have let him move in without committing to a date for the wedding."</p> 
<p>The same thought had occurred to Miranda, but she was not going to admit it. "He just thinks everyone needs more time to get used to the idea of his remarriage."</p> 
<p>"Who's 'everyone,' then?"</p> 
<p>"Well, Sophie, for a start."</p> 
<p>"And she reflects her mother's attitudes, you've already admitted. So what you're saying is that Ned won't marry you until his ex gives permission."</p> 
<p>"Olga, please take off your advocate's wig when you're talking to me."</p> 
<p>"Someone's got to tell you these things."</p> 
<p>"You oversimplify everything. I know it's your job, but I'm your sister, not a hostile witness."</p> 
<p>"I'm sorry I spoke."</p> 
<p>"I'm glad you spoke, because this is just the kind of thing I don't want you to say to Ned. He's the man I love, and I want to marry him, so I'm asking you to be nice to him over Christmas."</p> 
<p>"I'll do my best," Olga said lightly.</p> 
<p>Miranda wanted her sister to understand how important this was. "I need him to feel that he and I can build a new family together, for ourselves and the two children. I'm asking you to help me convince him we can do that."</p> 
<p>"All right. Okay."</p> 
<p>"If this holiday goes well, I think he'll agree to a date for the wedding."</p> 
<p>Olga touched Miranda's hand. "I get the message. I know how much it means to you. I'll be good."</p> 
<p>Miranda had made her point. Satisfied, she turned her mind to another area of friction. "I hope things go all right between Daddy and Kit."</p> 
<p>"So do I, but there's not much we can do about it."</p> 
<p>"Kit called me a few days ago. For some reason, he's dead keen to sleep in the guest cottage at Steepfall."</p> 
<p>Olga bridled. "Why should he have the cottage all to himself? That means you and Ned and Hugo and I will all have to squeeze into two poky bedrooms in the old house!"</p> 
<p>Miranda had expected Olga to resist this. "I know it's unreasonable, but I said it was okay by me. It was difficult enough to persuade him to come—I didn't want to put an obstacle in the way."</p> 
<p>"He's a selfish little bastard. What reason did he give you?"</p> 
<p>"I didn't question him."</p> 
<p>"Well, I will." Olga took her mobile phone from her briefcase and pressed a number.</p> 
<p>"Don't make an issue of this," Miranda pleaded.</p> 
<p>"I just want to ask him the question." Speaking into the phone, she said: "Kit—what's this about you sleeping in the cottage? Don't you think it's a bit—" She paused. "Oh. Why not? ... I see ... but why don't you—" She stopped abruptly, as if he had hung up on her.</p> 
<p>Miranda thought, sadly, that she knew what Kit had said. "What is it?"</p> 
<p>Olga put the phone back into her bag. "We don't need to argue about the cottage. He's changed his mind. He's not coming to Steepfall after all."</p>
