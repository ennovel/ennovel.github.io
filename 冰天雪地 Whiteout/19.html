<p>STANLEY dropped his bombshell during dinner.</p> 
<p>Miranda felt mellow. The osso bucco was hearty and satisfying, and her father had opened two bottles of Brunello di Montepulciano to go with it. Kit was restless, dashing upstairs every time his mobile rang, but everyone else was relaxed. The four kids ate quickly then retired to the barn to watch a DVD movie called Scream 2, leaving six adults around the table in the dining room: Miranda and Ned, Olga and Hugo, Daddy at the head and Kit at the foot. Lori served coffee while Luke loaded the dishwasher in the kitchen.</p> 
<p>Then Stanley said, "How would you all feel if I started dating again?"</p> 
<p>Everyone went quiet. Even Lori reacted: she stopped pouring coffee and stood still, staring at him in shock.</p> 
<p>Miranda had guessed, but all the same it was disquieting to hear him come right out and say it. She said, "I suppose we're talking about Toni Gallo."</p> 
<p>He looked startled and said, "No."</p> 
<p>Olga said, "Oh, poo."</p> 
<p>Miranda did not believe him, either, but she refrained from contradicting him.</p> 
<p>"Anyway, I'm not talking about anyone in particular, I'm discussing a general principle," he went on. "Mamma Marta has been dcad for a year and a half, may she rest in peace. For almost four decades she was the only woman in my life. But I'm sixty, and I probably have another twenty or thirty years to live. I may not want to spend them alone."</p> 
<p>Lori shot him a hurt look. He was not alone, she wanted to say; he had her and Luke.</p> 
<p>Olga said bad-temperedly, "So why consult us? You don't need our permission to sleep with your secretary or anyone else."</p> 
<p>"I'm not asking permission. I want to know how you would feel if it happened. And it won't be my secretary, by the way. Dorothy is very happily married."</p> 
<p>Miranda spoke, mainly to prevent Olga saying something harsh. "I think we'd find it hard, Daddy, to see you with another woman in this house. But we want you to be happy, and I believe we'd do our best to welcome someone you loved."</p> 
<p>He gave her a wry look. "Not exactly a ringing endorsement, but thank you for trying to be positive."</p> 
<p>Olga said, "You won't get that much from me. For God's sake, what are we supposed to say to you? Are you thinking of marrying this woman? Would you have more children?"</p> 
<p>"I'm not thinking of marrying anyone," he said tetchily. Olga was irritating him by refusing to argue on his terms. Mamma had always been able to get under his skin in exactly the same way. He added, "But I'm not ruling anything out."</p> 
<p>"It's outrageous." Olga stormed. "When I was a child I hardly saw you. You were always at the lab. Mamma and I were at home with baby Mandy from seven-thirty in the morning until nine at night. We were a onc-parent family, and it was all for your career, so that you could invent narrow-spectrum antibiotics and an ulcer drug and an anticholesterol pill, and become famous and rich. Well, I want a reward for my sacrifice."</p> 
<p>"You had a very expensive education," Stanley said.</p> 
<p>"It's not enough. I want my children to inherit the money you made, and I don't want them to share it with a litter of brats bred by some tart who knows nothing except how to take advantage of a widower."</p> 
<p>Miranda let out a cry of protest.</p> 
<p>Hugo, embarrassed, said, "Don't beat about the bush, Olga dear, say what's on your mind."</p> 
<p>Stanley's expression darkened, and he said, "I wasn't planning to date some tart."</p> 
<p>Olga saw that she had gone too far. She said, "I didn't mean that last part." For her, that amounted to an apology.</p> 
<p>Kit said flippantly, "It won't be much different. Mamma was tall, athletic, nonintellectual, and Italian. Toni Gallo is tall, athletic, nonintellectual, and Spanish. I wonder if she cooks."</p> 
<p>"Don't be stupid," Olga told him. "The difference is that for the last forty years Toni hasn't been part of this family, so she's not one of us, she's an outsider."</p> 
<p>Kit bridled. "Don't call me stupid, Olga. At least I can see what's under my nose."</p> 
<p>Miranda's heart missed a beat. What was he talking about?</p> 
<p>The same question occurred to Olga. "What's under my nose that I can't see?"</p> 
<p>Miranda glanced surreptitiously at Ned. She feared that later he might ask her what Kit meant. He often picked up on such things.</p> 
<p>Kit backed off. "Oh, stop cross-examining me, you're a pain in the arse.</p> 
<p>"Aren't you concerned about your financial future?" Olga said to Kit. "Your inheritance is threatened as much as mine. Have you got so much money that you don't care?"</p> 
<p>Kit laughed humorlessly. "Yeah, right."</p> 
<p>Miranda said to Olga, "Aren't you being a bit mercenary?"</p> 
<p>"Well, Daddy did ask."</p> 
<p>Stanley said, "I thought you might feel badly about your mother's being replaced by someone new. It never occurred to me that your main concern would be my will."</p> 
<p>Miranda felt hurt for her father. But she was more worried about Kit and what he might say. As a child, he had never been good at keeping secrets. She and Olga had been obliged to keep everything from him. If they trusted him with a confidence, he would blurt it out to Mamma in five minutes. Now he knew Miranda s darkest secret. He was no longer a child, but on the other h?nd he had never really grown up. This was dangerous. Her heart beat like a tom-tom. Perhaps if she took part in the conversation she had a chance of controlling it. She addressed Olga. "The important thing is to keep the family together. Whatever Daddy decides, we mustn't let it break us up."</p> 
<p>"Don't lecture me about the family," Olga said angrily. "Talk to your brother."</p> 
<p>Kit said, "Get off my case!"</p> 
<p>Stanley said, "I don't want to rake all that up again."</p> 
<p>Olga persisted. "But he's the one who has come closest to destroying the family."</p> 
<p>"Fuck you, Olga," Kit said.</p> 
<p>"Easy," Stanley said firmly. "We can have a passionate discussion without descending to insults and obscenity."</p> 
<p>"Come on, Daddy," Olga said. She was furious, because she had been called mercenary, and she needed to counterattack. "What could be more threatening to the family than one of us who steals from another?"</p> 
<p>Kit was red with shame and fury. "I'll tell you," he said.</p> 
<p>Miranda knew what was coming. Terrified, she stretched out her arm toward Kit with her hand upright in a Halt sign. "Kit, calm down, please," she said frantically.</p> 
<p>He was not listening. "I'll tell you what could be more threatening to the family."</p> 
<p>Miranda shouted at him: "Just shut up!"</p> 
<p>Stanley realized there was a subtext of which he was ignorant, and he frowned with puzzlement. "What are you two talking about?"</p> 
<p>Kit said, "I'm talking about someone—"</p> 
<p>Miranda stood up. "No!" —someone who sleeps—"</p> 
<p>Miranda snatched up a glass of water and threw it in Kit's face.</p> 
<p>There was a sudden hush.</p> 
<p>Kit wiped his face with his napkin. With everyone watching him in shocked silence, he said, "... sleeps with her sister's husband."</p> 
<p>Olga was bewildered. "This makes no sense. I never slept with Jasper—or Ned."</p> 
<p>Miranda held her head in her h?nds.</p> 
<p>"I didn't mean you," Kit said.</p> 
<p>Olga looked at Miranda. Miranda looked away.</p> 
<p>Lori, still standing there with the coffeepot, gave a gasp of sudden, shocked comprehension.</p> 
<p>Stanley said, "Good God! I never imagined that."</p> 
<p>Miranda looked at Ned. He was horrified. He said, "Did you?"</p> 
<p>She did not reply.</p> 
<p>Olga turned to Hugo. "You and my sister?"</p> 
<p>He tried his bad-boy grin. Olga swung her arm and slapped his face. The blow had a solid sound, more like a punch. "Ow!" he cried, and rocked back in his chair.</p> 
<p>Olga said, "You lousy, lying . . ." She searched for words. "You worm. You pig. You bloody bastard, you rotten sod." She turned to Miranda. "And you!"</p> 
<p>Miranda could not meet her eye. She looked down at the table. A small cup of coffee was in front of her. The cup was fine white china with a blue stripe, Mamma's favorite set.</p> 
<p>"How could you?" Olga said to her. "How could you?"</p> 
<p>Miranda would try to explain, one day; but anything she said now would sound like an excuse. So she just shook her head.</p> 
<p>Olga stood up and walked out of the room.</p> 
<p>Hugo looked sheepish. "I'd better . . ." He followed her.</p> 
<p>Stanley suddenly realized that Lori was standing there listening to every word. Belatedly, he said, "Lori, you'd better help Luke in the kitchen."</p> 
<p>She started as if awakened. "Yes, Professor Oxenford."</p> 
<p>Stanley looked at Kit. "That was brutal." Anger made his voice shake.</p> 
<p>"Oh, that's right, blame me," Kit said petulantly. "I didn't sleep with Hugo, did I?" He threw down his napkin and left.</p> 
<p>Ned was mortified. "Um, excuse me," he said, and he went out.</p> 
<p>Only Miranda and her father were left in the room. Stanley got up and came to her side. He put his h?nd on her shoulder. "They'll all calm down about it, eventually," he said. "This is bad, but it will pass."</p> 
<p>She turned to him and pressed her face into the soft tweed of his waistcoat. "Oh, Daddy, I'm sorry," she said, and she began to cry.</p>
