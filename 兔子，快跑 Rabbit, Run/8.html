Usually, the dream is worse than the reality: God rules reality. The actual presences of people are always bearable. Mrs. Springer is a plump, dark, small?boned woman with a gypsy look about her. Both the mother and the daughter have a sinister aura, but in the mother this ability to create uneasiness is a settled gift, thoroughly meshed into the strategies of middle?class life. With the daughter it is a floating thing, useless and as dangerous to herself as to others. Eccles is relieved that Janice is out of the house; he feels guiltiest in her presence. She and Mrs. Fosnacht have gone into Brewer to a matinee of Some Like It Hot. Their two sons are in the Springers' back yard. Mrs. Springer takes him through the house to the screened?in porch, where she can keep an eye on the children. Her house is expensively but confusedly famished; each room seems to contain one more easy chair than necessary. To get from the front door to the back they take a crooked path in the packed rooms. She leads him slowly; both of her ankles are bound in elastic bandages. The pained littleness of her steps reinforces his illusion that her hips are encased in a plaster cast. She gently lowers herself onto the cushions of the porch glider and startles Eccles by kicking up her legs as, with a squeak and sharp sway, the glider takes her weight. The action seems to express pleasure; her bald pale calves stick out stiff and her saddle shoes are for a moment lifted from the floor. These shoes are cracked and rounded, as if they've been revolved in a damp tub for years. He sits down in a trickily hinged aluminumand?plastic lawn chair. Through the porch screen at his side, he can see Nelson Angstrom and the slightly older Fosnacht boy play in the sun around a swing?slide?and?sandbox set. Eccles once bought one of those and when it came, all in pieces in a long cardboard box, was humiliated to find himself unable to put it together; Angus, the old deaf sexton, finally had to do it for him.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"It's nice to see you," Mrs. Springer says. "It's been so long since you came last."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>`Just three weeks, isn't it?" he says. The chair presses against his back and he hooks his heels around the pipe at the bottom to keep it from folding. "It's been a busy time, with the confirmation classes and the Youth Group deciding to have a softball team this year and a number of deaths in the parish." His previous contacts with this woman have not disposed him to be apologetic. Her having so large a home offends his aristocratic sense of caste; he would like her better, and she would be more comfortable, if her place were smaller.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Yes I wouldn't want your job for the world."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I enjoy it most of the time."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"They say you do. They say you're becoming quite an expert golf player."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Oh dear. And he thought she was relaxing. He thought for the moment they were on the porch of a shabby peeling house and she was a long?suffering fat factory wife who had learned to take fife as it came. That is what she looked like; that is easily what she might have been. Fred Springer when he married her was probably less likely?looking than Harry Angstrom when her daughter married him. He tries to imagine Harry four years ago, and gets a presentable picture: tall, fair, famous in his school days, clever enough ? a son of the morning. His air of confidence must have especially appealed to Janice. David and Michal. Defraud ye not one the other .... He scratches his forehead and says, "Playing golf with someone is a good way to get to know him. That's what I try to do, you understand ? get to know people. I don't think you can lead someone to Christ unless you know him."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Well now what do you know about my son?in?law that I don't?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"That he's a good man, for one thing."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Good for what?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Must you be good for something?" He tries to think. "Yes, I suppose you must."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Nelson! Stop that this minute!" She turns rigid in the glider but does not rise to see what is making the boy cry. Eccles, sitting by the screen, can see. The Fosnacht boy stands by the swing, holding two red plastic trucks. Angstrom's son, some inches shorter, is batting with an open hand toward the bigger boy's chest, but does not quite dare to move forward a step and actually strike him. Young Fosnacht stands fast, with the maddening invulnerability of the stupid, looking down at the flailing hand and contorted face of the smaller boy without even a smile of satisfaction, a true scientist, observing without passion the effect of his experiment. Mrs. Springer's voice leaps to a frantic hardness and cuts through the screen: "Did you hear me I said stop that bawling!"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nelson's face turns up toward the porch and he tries to explain, "Pilly have ?Pilly -" But just trying to describe the injustice gives it unbearable force, and as if struck from behind he totters forward and slaps the thief's chest and receives a mild shove that makes him sit on the ground. He rolls on his stomach and spins in the grass, revolved by his own incoherent kicking. Eccles' heart seems to twist with the child's body; he knows so well the propulsive power of a wrong, the way the mind batters against it and each futile blow sucks the air emptier until it seems the whole frame of blood and bone must burst in a universe that can be such a vacuum.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"The boy's taken his truck," he tells Mrs. Springer.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Well let him get it himself," she says. "He must learn. I can't be getting up on these legs and running outside every minute; they've been at it like that all afternoon."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Billy." The boy looks up in surprise toward Eccles' male voice. "Give it back." Billy considers this new evidence and hesitates indeterminately. "Now, please." Convinced, Billy walks over and pedantically drops the toy on his sobbing playmate's head.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The new pain starts fresh grief in Nelson's throat, but seeing the truck on the grass beside his face chokes him. It takes him a moment to realize that the cause of his misery is removed and another moment to rein the emotion in his body. His great dry gasps as he rounds these comers seem to heave the sheet of trimmed grass and the sunshine itself. A wasp bumping persistently against the screen dips and the aluminum chair under Eccles threatens to buckle; as if the wide world is participating in Nelson's readjustment.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I don't know why the boy is such a sissy," Mrs. Springer says. "Or maybe I do."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Her sly adding this irks Eccles. "Why?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The liverish skin under her eyes lifts and the corners of her mouth pull down in an appraising scowl. "Well, he's like his dad: spoiled. He's been made too much of and thinks the world owes him what he wants."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"It was the other boy; Nelson only wanted what was his."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Yes and I suppose you think with his dad it was all Janice's fault." The way she pronounces ` Janice" makes the girl seem more substantial, precious, and important than the pathetic shadow in Eccles' mind. He wonders if she's not, after all, right: if he hasn't gone over to the other side.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Nó I don't," he says. "I think his behavior has no justification. This isn't to say, though, that his behavior doesn't have reasons, reasons that in part your daughter could have controlled. With my Church, I believe that we are all responsible beings, responsible for ourselves and for each other." The words, so well turned?out, taste chalky in his mouth. He wishes she'd offer him something to drink. Spring is turning warm.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The old gypsy sees his uncertainty. "Well that's easy to say," she says. "It's not so easy maybe to take such a view if you're nine months expecting and from a respectable home and your husband's running around a few miles away with some bat and everybody thinks it's the funniest thing since I don't know what." The word "bat" darts into the air like one, quick and black.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Nobody thinks it's funny, Mrs. Springer."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You don't hear the talk I do. You don't see the smiles. Why, one woman as good as said to me the other day if she can't keep him she has no right to him. She had the gall to grin right in my face. I could have strangled her. I said to her, `A man has duty too. It isn't all one way.' It's women like her give men the ideas they have, that the world's just here for their pleasure. From the way you act you half?believe it too. Well if the world is going to be full of Harry Angstroms how much longer do you think they'll need your church?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She has sat up and her dark eyes are lacquered by tears that do not fall. Her voice has risen in pitch and abrades Eccles' face like a file; he feels covered with cuts. Her talk of the smiling gossip encircling this affair has surrounded him with a dreadful reality, like the reality of those hundred faces when on Sunday mornings at 11:30 he mounts the pulpit and the text flies from his mind and his notes dissolve into nonsense. He fumbles through his memory and manages to bring out, "I feel Harry is in some respects a special case."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"The only thing special about him is he doesn't care who he hurts or how much. Now I mean no offense, Reverend Eccles, and I'm sure you've done your best considering how busy you are, but to be honest I wish that first night I had called the police like I wanted to."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He seems to hear that she is going to call the police to arrest him. Why not? With his white collar he forges God's name on every word he speaks. He steals belief from the children he is supposed to be teaching. He murders faith in the minds of any who really listen to his babble. He commits fraud with every schooled cadence of the service, mouthing Our Father when his heart knows the real father he is trying to please, has been trying to please all his life, the God who smokes cigars. He asks her, "What can the police do?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Well I don't know but more than play golf I expect."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I'm quite sure he will come back."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You've been saying that for two months."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I still believe it." But he doesn't, he doesn't believe anything. There is silence while Mrs. Springer seems to read this fact in his face.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Could you" ? her voice is changed; it beseeches ? "bring me over that stool there in the corner? I have to get my legs up."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When he blinks, his eyelids scratch. He rouses from his daze and gets the stool and takes it to her. Her broad shins in their green childlike socks lift meekly, and as he places the stool under the heels, his bending, with its echo of religious?pamphlet paintings of Christ washing the feet ofbeggars, fits his body to receive a new flow of force. He straightens up and towers above her. She plucks at her skirt at the knees, tugging it down.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Thank you," she says. "That's a real relief for me."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I'm afraid it's the only sort of relief I've given you," he confesses with a simplicity that he finds, and mocks himself for finding, admirable.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Ah," she sighs. "There's not much anybody can do I guess."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"No, there are things to do. Perhaps you're right about the police. Or at least a lawyer."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Fred's against it."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Mr. Springer has good reasons. I don't mean merely business reasons. All the law can extract from Harry is financial support; and I don't think, in this case, that money is really the point. In fact I'm not sure money is ever really the point."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"That's easy to say if you've always had enough." He doesn't mind. It seems to slip from her automatically, with less malice than lassitude; he is certain she wants to listen.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"That may be. I don't know. But at any rate my concern everyone's concern for that matter, I'm sure ? is with the general health of the situation. And if there's to be a true healing, it must be Harry and Janice who act. Really, no matter how much we want to help, no matter how much we try to do on the fringes, we're outside." In imitation of his father he has clasped his hands behind him and turned his back on his auditor; through the screen he watches the one other who, perhaps, is not outside, Nelson, lead the Fosnacht boy across the lawn in pursuit of a neighbor's dog. Nelson's laughter spills from his head as his clumsy tottering steps jar his body. The dog is old, reddish, small, and slow; the Fosnacht boy is puzzled yet pleased by his friend's cry of "Lion! Lion!" It interests Eccles to see that under conditions of peace Angstrom's boy leads the other. The green air seen through the muzzy screen seems to vibrate with Nelson's noise. Eccles feels the situation: this constant translucent outpour of selfless excitement must naturally now and then dam in the duller boy's narrower passages and produce a sullen backflow, a stubborn bullying act. He pities Nelson, who will be stranded in innocent surprise many times before he locates in himself the source of this strange reverse tide. It seems to Eccles that he himselfwas this way as a boy, always giving and giving and always being suddenly swamped. The old dog's tail wags as the boys approach. It stops wagging and droops in an uncertain wary arc when they surround it like hunters, crowing. Nelson reaches out and beats the dog's back with both hands. Eccles wants to shout; the dog might bite; he can't bear to watch.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Yes but he drifts further away," Mrs. Springer is whining. "He's well off. He has no reason to come back if we don't give him one."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Eccles sits down in the aluminum chair again. "No. He'll come back for the same reason he left. He's fastidious. He has to loop the loop. The world he's in now, the world of this girl in Brewer, won't continue to satisfy his fantasies. Just in seeing him from week to week, I've noticed a change."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Well not to hear Peggy Fosnacht tell it. She says she hears he's leading the life of Riley. I don't know how many women he has."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Just one, I'm sure. The strange thing about Angstrom, he's by nature a domestic creature. Oh dear."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There is a flurry in the remote group; the boys run one way and the dog the other. Young Fosnacht halts but Nelson keeps coming, his face stretched by fright.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mrs. Springer hears his sobbing and says angrily, "Did they get Elsie to snap again? That dog must be sick in the head the way she keeps coming over here for more."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Eccles jumps up ? his chair collapses behind him ? and opens the screen door and runs down to meet Nelson in the sunshine. The boy shies from him. He grabs him. "Did the dog bite?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The boy's sobbing is paralyzed by this new fright, the man in black grabbing him.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Did Elsie bite you?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Fosnacht boy hangs back at a safe distance.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nelson, unexpectedly solid and damp in Eccles' arms, releases great rippling gasps and begins to find his voice.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Eccles shakes him to choke this threat of wailing and, wild to make himself understood, with a quick lunge clicks his teeth at the child's cheek. "Like that? Did the dog do that?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The boy's face goes rapt at the pantomime. "Like dis," he says, and his fine little lip lifts from his teeth and his nose wrinkles and he jerks his head an inch to one side.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"No bite?" Eccles insists, relaxing the grip of his arms.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The little lip lifts again with that miniature fierceness. Eccles feels mocked by a petite facial alertness that recalls, in tilt and cast, Harry's. Sobbing sweeps over Nelson again and he breaks away and runs up the porch steps to his grandmother. Eccles stands up; in just that little time of squatting the sun has started sweat on his black back.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As he climbs the steps he is troubled by something pathetic, something penetratingly touching, in the memory of those tiny square teeth bared in that play snarl. The harmlessness yet the reality of the instinct: the kitten's instinct to kill the spool with its cotton paws.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He comes onto the porch to find the boy between his grand-mother's legs, his face buried in her belly. In worming against her warmth he has pulled her dress up from her knees, and their repulsive breadth and pallor, laid bare defenselessly, superimposed upon the tiny, gamely gritted teeth the boy exposed for him, this old whiteness strained through this fine mesh, make a milk that feels to Eccles like his own blood. Strong ? as if pity is, as he has been taught, not a helpless outcry but a powerful tide that could redeem the world ? he steps forward and promises to the two bowed heads, "If he doesn't come back when she has the baby, then you should get the law after him. There are laws, of course; quite a few."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Elsie snaps," Mrs. Springer says, "because you and Billy tease her."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Naughty Elsie," Nelson says.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Naughty Nelson," Mrs. Springer corrects. She lifts her face to Eccles and continues in the same correcting voice, "Yes well she's a week due now and I don't see him running in."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>His moment of sympathy for her has passed; he leaves her on the porch. Love never ends, he tells himself, using the Revised Standard Version. The King James has it that it never fails. Mrs. Springer's voice carries after him into the house, "Now the next time I catch you teasing Elsie you're going to get a whipping from your grandmom."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"No, Mom?mom," the child begs coyly, fright gone.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Eccles thought he would find the kitchen and take a drink of water from the tap but the kitchen slips by him in the jumble of rooms. He makes a mouth that works up saliva and swallows it as he leaves the stucco house. He gets into his Buick and drives down Joseph Street and then a block along Jackson Road to the Angstroms' number, 303.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mrs. Angstrom has four?cornered nostrils. Lozenge?shape, they are set in a nose that is not so much large as extra?defined; the little pieces of muscle and cartilage and bone are individually emphatic and divide the skin into many facets in the sharp light. Their interview takes place in her kitchen amid several burning light bulbs. Burning in the middle of day: their home is the dark side of a two?family brick house. She came to the door wearing suds on her red forearms and returns with him to a sink full of bloated shirts and underwear. She plunges at these things vigorously while they talk. She is a vigorous woman. Mrs. Springer's fat ? soft, aching excess ? had puffed out from little bones, the bones once of a slip of a woman like Janice; Mrs. Angstrom's is packed on a great harsh frame. Harry's size must come from her side. Eccles is continually conscious of the long faucets, heraldic of cool water, shielded by her formidable body; but the opportunity never arises for a request so small as a glass of water.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I don't know why you come to me," she says. "Harold's one and twenty. I have no control over him."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"He hasn't been to see you?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"No sir." She displays her profile above her left shoulder. "You've made him so ashamed I suppose he's embarrassed to."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"He should be ashamed, don't you think?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I wouldn't know why. I never wanted him to go with the girl in the first place. Just to look at her you know she's two?thirds crazy."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Oh now, that's not true, is it?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Not true! Why the first thing that girl said to me was, Why don't I get a washing machine? Comes into my kitchen, takes one look around, and starts telling me how to manage my life."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Surely you don't think she meant anything."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"No, she didn't mean anything. All she meant was, What was I doing living in such a run?down half?house when she came from a great big stucco barn on Joseph Street with the kitchen full of gadgets, and, Wasn't I lucky to be fobbing off my boy on such a well?equipped little trick? I never liked that girl's eyes. They never met your face full?on." She turns her face on Eccles and, warned, he returns her stare. Beneath her misted spectacles ? an old?fashioned type, circles of steel?rimmed glass in which the bifocal crescents catch a pinker tint of light ?her arrogantly tilted nose displays its meaty, intricate underside. Her broad mouth is stretched slightly by a vague expectation. Eccles realizes that this woman is a humorist. The difficulty with humorists is that they will mix what they believe with what they don't ? whichever seems likelier to win an effect. The strange thing is how much he likes her, though in a way she is plunging at him as roughly as she plunges the dirty clothes. But that's it, it's the same to her. Unlike Mrs. Springer, she doesn't really see him at all. Her confrontation is with everybody, and secure under the breadth of her satire he can say what he pleases.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He bluntly defends Janice. "The girl is shy."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Shy! She wasn't too shy to get herself pregnant so poor Hassy has to marry her when he could scarcely tuck his shirt?tail in."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"He was one and twenty, as you say."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Yes, well, years. Some die young; some are born old."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Epigrams, everything. My, she is funny. Eccles laughs out loud. She doesn't acknowledge hearing him, and turns to her wash with furious seriousness. "About as shy as a snake," she says, "that girl. These little women are poison. Mincing around with their sneaky eyes getting everybody's sympathy. Well she doesn't get mine; let the men weep. To hear her father?in?law talk she's the worst martyr since Joan of Arc."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He laughs again; but isn't she? "Well, uh, what does Mr. Angstrom think Harry should do?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Crawl back. What else? He will, too, poor boy. He's just like his father underneath. All soft heart. I suppose that's why men rule the world. They're all heart."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"That's an unusual view."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Is it? It's what they keep telling you in church. Men are all heart and women are all body. I don't know who's supposed to have the brains. God, I suppose."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Eccles smiles, wondering if the Lutheran church gives everyone such ideas. Luther himself was a little like this, perhaps overstating half?truths in a kind of comic wrath. The whole black Protestant paradox?thumping maybe begins there. Helpless, predestined Man, the king of Creation. Utterly fallen: a hubris in shoving the particular aside. Maybe: he's forgotten most of the theology they made him absorb. It occurs to him that he should see the Angstroms' pastor.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mrs. Angstrom picks up a dropped thread. "Now my daughter Miriam is as old as the hills and always was; I've never worried about her. I remember, on Sundays long ago when we'd walk out by the quarry Harold was so afraid ?he wasn't more than twelve then ? he was so afraid she'd fall over the edge. I knew she wouldn't. You watch her. She won't marry out of pity like poor Hassy and then have all the world jump on him for trying to get out."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I'm not so sure the world has jumped on him. The girl's mother and I were just discussing that it seemed quite the contrary."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Don't you think it. That girl gets no sympathy from me. She has everybody on her side from Eisenhower down. They'll talk him around. You'll talk him around. And there's another."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The front door has opened with a softness she alone hears. Her husband comes into the kitchen wearing a white shirt and a tie but with his fingernails outlined in black; he is a printer. He is as tall as his wife but seems shorter. His mouth works self?deprecatorily over badly fitted false teeth. His nose is Harry's, a neat smooth button. "How do you do, Father," he says; either he was raised as a Catholic or among Catholics.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Mr. Angstrom, it's very nice to meet you." The man's hand has tough ridges but a soft, dry palm. "We've been discussing your son."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I feel terrible about that." Eccles believes him. Earl Angstrom has a gray, ragged look. This business has blighted him. He thins his lips across his slipping teeth like a man with stomach trouble biting back gas. He is being nibbled from within. Color has washed from his hair and eyes like cheap ink. A straight man, who has measured his life with the pica?stick and locked the forms tight, he has returned in the morning and found the type scrambled.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"He goes on and on about the girl as if she was the mother of Christ," Mrs. Angstrom says.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"That's not true," Angstrom says mildly, and sits down in his white shirt at the porcelain kitchen table. Four settings, year after year, have worn black blurs through the enamel. "I just don't see how Harry could make such a mess. He wasn't like other boys, sloppy. He was a tidy worker."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With raw sudsy hands Mrs. Angstrom has set about heating coffee for her husband. This small act of service seems to bring her into harmony with him; they begin, in the sudden way of old couples apparently at odds, to speak as one. "It was the Army," she says. "When he came back from Texas he was a different boy."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"He didn't want to come into the shop," Angstrom says. "He didn't want to go into a dirty trade."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Reverend Eccles, would you like some coffee?" Mrs. Angstrom asks.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>At last, his chance. "No, thank you. What I would love, though, is a glass of water."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Just water? With ice?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Any way. Any way would be lovely."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Yes, Earl is right," she says. "People now say how lazy Hassy is, but he's not. He never was. When you'd be proud of his basketball in high school you know, people would say, `Yes well but he's so tall, it's easy for him.' But they didn't know how he had worked at that. Out back every evening banging the ball way past dark; you wondered how he could see."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"From about twelve years old on," Angstrom says, "he was at that night and day. I put a pole up for him out back; the garage wasn't high enough."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"When he set his mind to something," Mrs. Angstrom says, "there was no stopping him." She yanks powerfully at the lever of the ice?cube tray and with a brilliant multiple crunch that sends chips sparkling the cubes come loose. "He wanted to be best at that and I honestly believe he was."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I know what you mean," Eccles says. "I play a little golf with him and already he's become better than I am."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She puts the cubes in a glass and holds the glass under a spigot and brings it to him. He tilts it at his lips and Earl Angstrom's palely vehement voice wavers through the liquid. "Then he comes back from the Army and all he cares about is chasing ass."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Your language, Earl," his wife says, setting coffee in a flowered cup on the table between his hands.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He looks down into the steam and says, "Excuse me. When I think of what that boy's doing my stomach does somersaults. He's become the worst kind of Brewer bum. If I could get my loving hands on him, Father, I'd try to thrash him if he killed me in the process." His ashen face bunches defiantly at the mouth; his colorless eyes swarm with glitter.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Eccles says "No" into his tilted glass like a megaphone and then drinks until no more water can be sucked from under the ice cubes that bump his upper lip. He wipes the moisture from his mouth and says, "There's a great deal of goodness in your son. When I'm with him ? it's rather unfortunate, really ? I feel so cheerful I quite forget what the point of my seeing him is." He laughs, first at Mr., and, failing here to rouse a smile, at Mrs.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"This golf you play," Angstrom says. "What is the point? In my opinion a good swift kick is what he needs. The girl's parents should call in the Brewer police, him living in sin with a tart like that."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Eccles glances toward Mrs. Angstrom and feels the arch of his eyebrows like drying paste on his forehead. He didn't expect, a minute ago, to be looking toward her as an ally and toward this worn?out good man as a rather vulgar and disappointing foe.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Don't talk nonsense, Earl," Mrs. Angstrom says. "What does Springer want with his name in the papers? The way you talk you'd think poor Harry was your enemy."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"He is my enemy," Angstrom says. He touches the saucer from both sides with his stained fingertips. "That night I spent walking the streets looking for him he became my enemy. You can't talk. You didn't see the girl's face."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"What do I care about her face? You talk about tarts: they don't become ivory?white saints in my book just by having a marriage license. That girl wanted Harry and got him with the only trick she knew and now she's run out of tricks."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Don't talk that way, Mary. It's just words with you. Suppose I had acted the way Harry has."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Ah," she says, and turns, and Eccles flinches, seeing her face taut to release a missile. "I didn't want you; you wanted me. Or wasn't it that way?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Yes of course it was that way," Angstrom mutters.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Well then: where's the comparison?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Angstrom has hunched his shoulders over the coffee, drawn himself in very small, as if she has boxed him into a tiny corner. "Oh Mary," he sighs, not daring move with words.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Eccles tries to defend him; he goes to the weaker side of a fight almost automatically. "I don't think you can say," he tells Mrs. Angstrom, "that Janice didn't imagine that her marriage was built on mutual attraction. If the girl was such a clever schemer she wouldn't have let Harry slip away so easily."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mrs. Angstrom's interest in this discussion, now that she knows she pressed her husband too hard, has waned; she maintains a position ? that Janice is in control ? so obviously false that it amounts to a concession. "She hasn't let him slip away," she says. "She'll have him back, you watch."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Eccles asks the man, "Do you think too that Harry will come around?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"No," Angstrom says, looking down, "never. He's too far gone. He'll just slide deeper and deeper now until we might as well forget him. If he was twenty, or twenty?two; but at his age . . . In the shop sometimes you see these young Brewer bums. They can't stick it. They're like cripples only they don't limp. Human garbage, they call them. And I sit there at the machine for two months wondering how the hell it could be my Harry, that used to hate a mess so much."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Eccles looks over at Harry's mother and is jarred to see her leaning against the sink with soaked cheeks gleaming under the glasses. He gets up in shock. Is she crying because she thinks her husband is speaking the truth, or because she thinks he is saying this just to hurt her, in revenge for making him admit that he had wanted her? "I hope you're wrong," Eccles says. "I must go now; I thank you both for discussing this with me. I realize it's painful."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Angstrom takes him back through the house and in the dark of the dining room touches his arm. "He liked things just so," he says. "I never saw a boy like him. Any rumpus in the family he'd take hard out of all reason ? when Mary and I, you know, would have our fun." Eccles nods, but doubts that "fun" quite describes what he's seen.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In the living?room shadows a slender girl stands in a barearmed summer dress. "Mim! Did you just get in?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Yeah."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"This is Father ? I mean Reverend ='</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Eccles."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Eccles, he came to talk about Harry. My daughter Miriam." "Hello, Miriam. I've heard Harry speak very fondly of you."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Hi."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With that word the big window behind her takes on the intimate glaze of the big window in a luncheonette. Flip greetings seem to trail behind her with wisps of cigarette smoke and drugstore perfume. Mrs. Angstrom's nose has delicacy on the girl's face, a sharpness Saracen or even more ancient, barbaric. Taken with the prominent nose her height at first glance seems her mother's, but when her father stands beside her, Eccles sees that it is his height; their bodies, the beautiful girl's and the weary man's, are the same. They have the same narrowness, and a serviceable vulgarity that offends him. They'll get through. They know what they're doing. It's a weakness of his, to prefer people who don't know what they're doing. The helpless: these, and the people on top, beyond help. The ones who maneuver more or less well in the middle seem to his aristocratic prejudices to be thieving from both ends. When they bunch at the door, Angstrom puts his arm around his daughter's waist and Eccles thinks of Mrs. Angstrom silent in the kitchen with her wet cheeks and red arms, a mad captive. Yet, turning on the pavement to wave at the two of them in the doorway, he has to smile at their incongruous symmetry, the earringed Arab boy with her innocent contempt for his eunuch's collar, and the limp?faced old woman of a printer, paired in slenderness, interlocked.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He gets into the Buick thirsty and vexed. There was something pleasant said in the last half?hour but he can't remember what it was. He feels scratched, hot, confused, and dry; he's spent an afternoon in a bramble patch. He's seen half a dozen people and a dog and nowhere did an opinion tally with his own, that Harry Angstrom was worth saving and could be saved. Instead down there between the brambles there seemed to be no Harry at all: nothing but stale air and last year's dead stalks. The day is declining through the white afternoon to the long blue spring evening. He drives past a corner where someone is practicing on a trumpet behind an open upstairs window. Du du do do da da dee. Dee dee da da do do du. Cars are whispering home from work. He drives across the town, tacking on the diagonal streets along a course parallel to the distant ridge of the mountain. Fritz Kruppenbach, Mt. Judge's Lutheran minister for twenty?seven years, lives in a high brick house not far from the cemetery. The motorcycle belonging to his college?age son is on its side in the driveway, partly dismantled. The sloping lawn, graded in fussy terraces, has the unnatural chartreuse evenness that comes with much fertilizing, much weed?killing, and much mowing. Mrs. Kruppenbach ? will Lucy ever achieve that dimpled, obedient look? ? comes to the door in a dark wool dress that makes no compromise with the season. Her gray hair girdles her head with braids of great compactness. When she lets all that hair down, she must be a witch. "He's mowing out back," she says.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I'd like to talk to him for just a few minutes. It's a problem that involves our two congregations."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Go up to his room, why do?an tcha? I'll fetch him."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The house ? foyer, halls, staircase, even the minister's leathery den upstairs ? is flooded with the smell of beef roasting. Eccles sits by the window of Kruppenbach's den on an oak?backed choir pew left over from some renovation. Seated on the bench he feels an adolescent compulsion to pray but instead peers across the valley at the green fragments of the golf course where he would like to be, with Harry. Eccles has found other partners either better or worse than he; only Harry is both, and only Harry gives the game a desperate gaiety, as if they are together engaged in an impossible quest set by a benevolent but absurd lord, a quest whose humiliations sting them almost to tears but one that is renewed at each tee, in a fresh flood of green. And for Eccles there is an additional hope, a secret detennination to trounce Harry. He feels that the thing that makes Harry unsteady, that makes him unable to repeat his beautiful effortless swing every time, is the thing at the root of all the problems that he has created; and that by beating him decisively he, Eccles, will get on top of this weakness, this flaw, and hence solve the problems. In the meantime there is the pleasure of hearing Harry now and then cry, "Hey, hey," or "I love it, love it!" Their rapport at moments attains for Eccles a pitch of pleasure, a harmless ecstasy, that makes the world with its vicious circumstantiality seem remote and spherical and green.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The house shudders to the master's step. Kruppenbach comes up the stairs into his den, angry at being taken from his lawnmowing. He wears old black pants and an undershirt soaked with sweat. His shoulders are coated with wiry gray wool.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Hello, Chack," he says at pulpit volume, with no intonation of greeting. His German accent makes his words seem stones, set angrily one on top of another. "What is it?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Eccles, not daring "Fritz" with the older man, laughs and blurts, "Hello!"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Kruppenbach grimaces. He has a massive square head, crewcut. He is a man of brick: as if he was born as a baby literally of clay and decades of exposure have baked him to the color and hardness of brick. He repeats, "What?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You have a family called Angstrom."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Yes."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"The father's a printer."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Yes."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Their son, Harry, deserted his wife over two months ago; her people, the Springers, are in my church."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Yes, well. The boy. The boy's a Schussel."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Eccles isn't certain what that means. He supposes that Kruppenbach doesn't sit down because he doesn't want to stain his furniture with his own sweat. His continuing to stand puts Eccles in a petitionary position, sitting on the bench like a choirboy. The odor of meat cooking grows more insistent as he explains what he thinks happened: how Harry has been in a sense spoiled by his athletic successes; how the wife, to be fair, had perhaps showed little imagination in their marriage; how he himself, as minister, had tried to keep the boy's conscience in touch with his wife without pressing him into a premature reunion, for the boy's problem wasn't so much a lack of feeling as an uncontrolled excess of it; how the four parents, for various reasons, were of little help; how he had witnessed, just minutes ago, a quarrel between the Angstroms that perhaps offered a clue as to why their son</p> 
<p>"Do you think," Kruppenbach at last interrupts, "do you think this is your job, to meddle in these people's lives? I know what they teach you at seminary now: this psychology and that. But I don't agree with it. You think now your job is to be an unpaid doctor, to run around and plug up the holes and make everything smooth. I don't think that. I don't think that's your job."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I only ?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"No now let me finish. I've been in Mt. Judge twenty?seven years and you've been here two. I've listened to your story but I wasn't listening to what it said about the people, I was listening to what it said about you. What I heard was this: the story of a minister of God selling his message for a few scraps of gossip and a few games of golf. What do you think now it looks like to God, one childish husband leaving one childish wife? Do you ever think any more what God sees? Or have you grown beyond that?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"No, of course not. But it seems to me our role in a situation like this =</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"It seems to you our role is to be cops, cops without handcuffs, without guns, without anything but our human good nature. Isn't it right? Don't answer, just think if I'm not right. Well, I say that's a Devil's idea. I say, let the cops be cops and look after their laws that have nothing to do with us."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I agree, up to a point -"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"There iss no up to a point! There is no reason or measure in what we must do." His thick forefinger, woolly between the knuckles, has begun to tap emphasis on the back of a leather chair. "If Gott wants to end misery He'll declare the Kingdom now." Jack feels a blush begin to bum his face. "How big do you think your little friends look among the billions that God sees? In Bombay now they die in the streets every minute. You say role. I say you don't know what your role is or you'd be home locked in prayer. There is your role: to make yourself an exemplar of faith. There is where comfort comes from: faith, not what little finagling a body can do here and there, stirring the bucket. In running back and forth you run from the duty given you by God, to make your faith powerful, so when the call comes you can go out and tell them, `Yes, he is dead, but you will see him again in Heaven. Yes, you suffer, but you must love your pain, because it is Christ's pain.' When on Sunday morning then, when we go before their faces, we must walk up not worn out with misery but full of Christ, hot" ? he clenches his hairy fists ? "with Christ, on fire: burn them with the force of our belief. That is why they come; why else would they pay us? Anything else we can do or say anyone can do and say. They have doctors and lawyers for that. It's all in the Book ? a thief with faith is worth all the Pharisees. Make no mistake. Now I'm serious. Make no mistake. There is nothing but Christ for us. All the rest, all this decency and busyness, is nothing. It is Devil's work."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Fritz," Mrs. Kruppenbach's voice calls carefully up the stairs. "Supper."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The red man in his undershirt looks down at Eccles and asks, "Will you kneel a moment with me and pray for Christ to come into this room?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"No. No I won't. I'm too angry. It would be hypocritical."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The refusal, unthinkable from a layman, makes Kruppenbach, not softer, but stiller. "Hypocrisy," he says mildly. "You have no seriousness. Don't you believe in damnation? Didn't you know when you put that collar on, what you risked?" In the brick skin of his face his eyes seem small imperfections, pink and glazed with water as if smarting in intense heat.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He turns without waiting for Jack to answer and goes downstairs for supper. Jack descends behind him and continues out the door. His heart is beating like a scolded child's and his knees are weak with fury. He had come for an exchange of information and been flagellated with an insane spiel. Unctuous old thundering Hun, no conception of the ministry as a legacy of light, probably himself scrambled into it out of a butcher's shop. Jack realizes that these are spiteful and unworthy thoughts but he can't stop them. His depression is so deep that he tries to gouge it deeper by telling himself He's right, he's right as he sits behind the pearl?gray steering wheel. He bows his head so his forehead touches an arc of its perfect plastic circle, but he can't cry; he's parched. His shame and failure hang downward in him heavy but fruitless.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Though he knows that Lucy wants him home ? if dinner is not quite ready he will be in time to give the children their baths ? he instead drives to the drugstore in the center of town. The poodlecut girl behind the counter is in his Youth Group and two parishioners buying medicine or contraceptives or Kleenex hail him gaily. It is here that in truth they come to find the antidotes to their lives. He feels at home; Eccles feels most at home in Godless public places. He rests his wrists on the cold clean marble and orders a vanilla ice?cream soda with a scoop of maple?walnut ice cream, and drinks two Coca?Cola glasses full of miraculous clear water before it comes.</p>
