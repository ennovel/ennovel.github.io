Harry has such a hard loop in himself after he hears Eccles out. He doesn't know what he says to Eccles; all he is conscious of is the stacks of merchandise in jangling packages he can see through the windows of the phone?booth door. On the drugstore wall there is a banner bearing in red the one word PARADICHLOROBENZENE. All the while he is trying to understand Eccles he is rereading this word, trying to see where it breaks, wondering if it can be pronounced. Right when he finally understands, right at the pit of his life, a fat woman comes up to the counter and pays for two bottles of vitamins. He steps into the sunshine outside the drugstore swallowing, to keep the loop from rising in his body and choking him. It's a hot day, the first of summer; the heat comes up off the glittering pavement into the faces of pedestrians, strikes them sideways off the store windows and hot stone facades. In the white light faces wear the American expression, eyes squinting and mouths sagging open in a scowl, that makes them look as if they are about to say something menacing and cruel. In the street under glaring hardtops drivers bake in stalled traffic. Above, milk hangs in a sky that seems too exhausted to clear. Harry waits at a corner with some sweating footsore shoppers for a Mt. Judge bus, number 16n; when it hisses to a stop it is already packed. He hangs from a steel bar in the rear, fighting to keep from doubling up with the kink inside. Curved posters advertise filtered cigarettes and suntan lotion and C.A.R.E.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He had ridden one of these buses last night into Brewer and gone to Ruth's apartment but there was no light on and nobody answered his ring, though there was a dim light behind the frosted glass lettered F. X. PELLIGRINI. He sat around on the steps, looking down at the delicatessen until the lights went out and then looking at the bright church window. When the lights went out behind that he felt alone and hopeless and thought of going home. He wandered up to Weiser Street and looked down at all the lights and the great sunflower and couldn't see a bus and kept walking, down to the south side, and became afraid by himself and went into a low?looking hotel and bought a room. He didn't sleep very well; a neon tube with a taped connection fizzled outside the window and some woman kept laughing in another room. He woke up early enough to go back to Mt. Judge and get a suit and go to work but something held him back. Something held him back all day. He tries to think of what it was because whatever it was murdered his daughter. Wanting to see Ruth again was some of it but it was clear after he went around to her address in the morning that she wasn't there probably off to Atlantic City with some prick and still he wandered around Brewer, going in and out of department stores with music piping from the walls and eating a hot dog at the five and dime and hesitating outside a movie house but not going in and keeping an eye out for Ruth. He kept expecting to see the fat shoulders he used to kiss jostle out of a crowd and the ginger hair he used to beg to unpin shining on the other side of a rack of birthday cards. But it was a city of over a hundred thousand and the odds were totally against him and anyway there was tons of time, he could find her another day. No, what kept him in the city despite the increasing twisting inside that told him something was wrong back home, what kept him walking through the cold air breathed from the doors of movie houses and up and down between counters of perfumed lingerie and tinny jewelry and salted nuts (poor old Jan) and up into the park along paths he walked once with Ruth to watch from under a horsechestnut tree five mangy kids play cat with a tennis ball and a broomstick and then finally back down Weiser to the drugstore he called from, what kept him walking was the idea that somewhere he'd find an opening. For what made him mad at Janice wasn't so much that she was in the right for once and he was wrong and stupid but the closed feeling of it, the feeling of being closed in. He had gone to church and brought back this little flame and had nowhere to put it on the dark damp walls of the apartment, so it had flickered and gone out. And he realized that he wouldn't always be able to produce this flame. What held him back all day was the feeling that somewhere there was something better for him than listening to babies cry and cheating people in used?car lots and it's this feeling he tries to kill, right there on the bus; he grips the chrome bar and leans far over two women with white pleated blouses and laps of packages and closes his eyes and tries to kill it. The kink in his stomach starts to take the form of nausea and he clings to the icy bar bitterly as the bus swings around the mountain.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He gets off, in a sweat, blocks too soon. Here in Mt. Judge the shadows have begun to grow deep, the sun baking Brewer rides the crest of the mountain, and his sweat congeals, shortening his breath. He runs to keep his body occupied, to joggle his mind blank. Past a dry?cleaning plant with a little pipe hissing steam at the side. Through the oil and rubber smells riding above the asphalt pond around the red pumps of an Esso station. Past the Mt. Judge town?hall lawn and the World War II honor roll with the name plaques crumbled and blistered behind glass. His chest begins to hurt and he slows to a walk.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When he gets to the Springers' house Mrs. comes to the door and shuts it in his face. But he knows from the gray Buick parked outside big as a battleship that Eccles is in there and in a little while Jack comes to the door and lets him in. He says conspiratorially in the dim hall, "Your wife has been given a sedative and is asleep."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"The baby. . .</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"The undertaker has her."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Rabbit wants to cry out, it seems indecent, for the undertaker to be taking such a tiny body, that they ought to bury it in its own simplicity, like the body of a bird, in a small hole dug in the grass. But he nods. He feels he will never resist anything again.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Eccles goes upstairs and Harry sits in a chair and watches the light from the window play across an iron table of ferns and African violets and baby cacti. Where it hits the leaves they are bright yellow?green; the leaves in shadow in front of them look like black?green holes cut in this golden color. Somebody comes down the stairs with an erratic step. He doesn't turn his head to see who it is; he doesn't want to risk looking anybody in the face. A furry touch on his forearm and he meets Nelson's eyes. The child's face is stretched shiny with curiosity. "Mommy sleep," he says in a deep voice imitating the tragedy?struck voices he has been hearing.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Rabbit pulls him up into his lap. He's heavier and longer than he used to be. His body acts as a covering; he pulls the boy's head down against his neck. Nelson asks, "Baby sick?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Baby sick."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Big, big water in tub," Nelson says, and straggles to sit up so he can explain with his amts, which go wide. "Mom?mom came and took Mommy away." What all did the poor kid see? He wants to get off his father's lap but Harry holds him fast with a kind of terror; the house is thick with a grief that seems to threaten the boy. Also the boy's body wriggles with an energy that threatens the grief, might tip it and bring the whole house crashing down on them. It is himself he is protecting by imprisoning the child.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Eccles comes downstairs and stands there studying them. "Why don't you take him outside?" he asks. "He's had a nightmare of a day. &gt;,</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>They all three go outdoors. Eccles takes Harry's hand in a long quiet grip and says, "Stay here. You're needed, even if they don't tell you." After Eccles pulls away in his car, he and Nelson sit in the grass by the driveway and throw bits of gravel down toward the pavement. The boy laughs and talks in excitement but out here the sound is not so loud. Harry feels thinly protected by the fact that this is what Eccles told him to do. Men are walking home from work along the pavement; Nelson tosses a pebble too near the feet of one and the man looks up. This unknown face seems to stare at Harry from deep in another world, the world of the blameless, the world outside the bubble of Becky's death. He and Nelson change their target to a green lawn?seeder leaning against the wall of the garage. Harry hits it four times running. Though the air is still light the sunshine has shrunk to a few scraps in the tops of trees. The grass is growing damp and he wonders if he should sneak Nelson in the door and go.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mr. Springer comes to the door and calls, "Harry." They go over. "Becky's made a few sandwiches in place of supper," he says. "You and the boy come in." They go into the kitchen and Nelson eats. Harry refuses everything except a glass of water. Mrs. Springer is not in the kitchen and Harry is grateful for her absence. "Harry," Mr. Springer says, and stands up, patting his mustache with two fingers, like he's about to make a financial concession, "Reverend Eccles and Becky and I have had a talk. I won't say I don't blame you because of course I do. But you're not the only one to blame. Her mother and I somehow never made her feel secure, never perhaps you might say made her welcome, I don't know" ? his little pink crafty eyes are not crafty now, blurred and chafed ? "we gave her all we had, I'd like to think. At any rate" ? this comes out harsh and crackly; he pauses to regain quietness in his voice ? "life must go on. Am I making any sense to you?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Yes sir."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Life must go on. We must go ahead with what we have left. Though Becky's too upset to see you now, she agrees. We had a talk and agree that it's the only way. I mean, what I mean to say, I can see you're puzzled, is that we consider you in our family, Harry, despite" ? he lifts an arm vaguely toward the stairs ? "this." His arm slumps back and he adds the word "accident."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Harry shields his eyes with his hand. They feel hot and vulnerable to light. "Thank you," he says, and almost moans in his gratitude to this man, whom he has always despised, for making a speech so generous. He tries to frame, in accordance with an etiquette that continues to operate in the thick of grief as if underwater, a counter?speech. "I promise I'll keep my end of the bargain," he brings out, and stops, stifled by the abject sound of his voice. What made him say bargain?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I know you will," Springer says. "Reverend Eccles assures us you will."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Dessert," Nelson says distinctly.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Nelly, why don't you take a cookie to bed?" Springer speaks with a familiar jollity that, though strained, reminds Rabbit that the kid lived here for months. "Isn't it your bedtime? Shall Mommom take you up?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Daddy," Nelson says, and slides off his chair and comes to his father.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Both men are embarrassed. "O.K.," Rabbit says. "You show me your room."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Springer gets two Oreo cookies out of the pantry and unexpectedly Nelson runs forward to hug him. He stoops to accept the hug and his withered dandy's face goes blank against the boy's cheek; big black square cufflinks, thinly rimmed and initialed S in gold, creep out of his coat sleeves as his amts tighten the hug.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As Nelson leads his father to the stairs they pass the room where Mrs. Springer is sitting. Rabbit has a glimpse of a puffed face slippery with tears, like an interior organ surgically exposed, and averts his eyes. He whispers to Nelson to go in and kiss her good night. When the boy returns to him they go upstairs and down a smooth corridor papered with a design of old?style cars into a little room whose white curtains are tinted green by a tree outside. On either side of the window symmetrical pictures, one of kittens and one of puppies, are hung. He wonders if this was the room where Janice was little. It has a musty innocence, and a suspense, as if it stood empty for years. An old teddy bear, the fur worn down to cloth and one eye void, sits in a broken child's rocker. Has it been Janice's? Who pulled the eye out? Nelson becomes queerly passive in this room. Harry undresses the sleepy body, tanned brown all but the narrow bottom, puts it into pajamas and into bed and arranges the covers over it. He tells him, "You're a good boy." "Yop. &gt; "I'm going to go now. Don't be scared." "Daddy go way?" "So you can sleep. I'll be back." "O.K. Good." "Good." "Daddy?" "What?" "Is baby Becky dead?" "Yes." "Was she scared?" "Oh no. No. She wasn't scared." "Is she happy?" "Yeah, she's very happy now." "Good." "Don't you worry about it." "O.K."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You snuggle up." "Yop." "Think about throwing stones." "When I grow up, I'll throw them very far." "That's right. You can throw them pretty far now." "I know it." "O.K. Go to sleep." Downstairs he asks Springer, who is washing dishes in the kitchen, "You don't want me to stay here tonight, do you?" "Not tonight, Harry. I'm sorry. I think it would be better not tonight."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"O.K., sure. I'll go back to the apartment. Shall I come over in the morning?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Yes, please. We'll give you breakfast."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"No, I don't want any. I mean, to see Janice when she wakes up.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Yes of course."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You think she'll sleep the night through."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I think so."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Uh ? I'm sorry I wasn't at the lot today."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Oh, that's nothing. That's negligible."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You don't want me to work tomorrow, do you?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Of course not."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I still have the job, don't I?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Of course." His talk is gingerly; his eyes fidget; he feels his wife is listening.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You're being awfully good to me."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Springer doesn't answer; Harry goes out through the sunporch, so he won't have to glimpse Mrs. Springer's face again, and around the house and walks home in the soupy summer dark, which tinkles with the sounds of dishes being washed. He climbs Wilbur Street and goes in his old door and up the stairs. There is still that faint smell of something like cabbage cooking. He lets himself into the apartment with his key and turns on all the lights as rapidly as he can. He goes into the bathroom and the water is still in the tub. Some of it has seeped away so the top of the water is an inch below a faint gray line on the porcelain but the tub is still more than half full. A heavy, calm volume, odorless, tasteless, colorless, the water shocks him like the presence of a silent person in the bathroom. Stillness makes a dead skin on its unstirred surface. There's even a kind of dust on it. He rolls back his sleeve and reaches down and pulls the plug; the water swings and the drain gasps. He watches the line of water slide slowly and evenly down the wall of the tub, and then with a crazed vortical cry the last of it is sucked away. He thinks how easy it was, yet in all His strength God did nothing. Just that little rubber stopper to lift.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In bed he discovers that his legs ache from all the walking he did in Brewer today. His shins feel splintered; no matter how he twists, the pain, after a moment of relief gained by the movement, sneaks back. He tries praying to relax him but it doesn't do it. There's no connection. He opens his eyes to look at the ceiling and the darkness is mottled with an unsteady network of veins like the net of yellow and blue that mottled the skin of his baby. He remembers seeing her neat red profile through the window at the hospital and a great draft of grief sweeps through him, brings him struggling out of bed to turn on the lights. The electric glare seems thin. His groin aches to weep. He is afraid to stick even his hand into the bathroom; he fears if he turns on the light he will see a tiny wrinkled blue corpse lying face up on the floor of the drained tub. The pressure in his bladder grows until he is at last forced to dare; the dark bottom of the tub leaps up blank and white.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He expects never to go to sleep and, awaking with the slant of sunshine and the noise of doors slamming downstairs, feels his body has betrayed his soul. He dresses in haste, more panicked now than at any time yesterday. The event is realer. Invisible cushions press against his throat and slow his legs and arms; the kink in his chest has grown thick and crusty. Forgive me, forgive me, he keeps saying silently to no one.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He goes over to the Springers' and the tone of the house has changed; he feels everything has been rearranged slightly to make a space into which he can fit by making himself small. Mrs. Springer serves him orange juice and coffee and even speaks, cautiously.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Do you want cream?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"No. No. I'll drink it black."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"We have cream if you want it."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"No, really. It's fine."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Janice is awake. He goes upstairs and lies down beside her on the bed; she clings to him and sobs into the cup between his neck and jaw and the sheet. Her face has been shrunk; her body seems small as a child's, and hot and hard. She tells him, "I can't stand to look at anyone except you. I can't bear to look at the others."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"It wasn't your fault," he tells her. "It was mine."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I've got my milk back," Janice says, "and every time my breasts sting I think she must be in the next room."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>They cling together in a common darkness; he feels the walls between them dissolve in a flood of black; but the heavy knot of apprehension remains in his chest, his own.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He stays in the house all that day. Visitors come, and tiptoe about. Their manner suggests that Janice upstairs is very sick. They sit, these women, over coffee in the kitchen with Mrs. Springer, whose petite rounded voice, oddly girlish divorced from the sight of her body, sighs on and on like an indistinct, rising and falling song. Peggy Fosnacht comes, her sunglasses off, her walleyes wide to the world, and goes upstairs. Her son Billy plays with Nelson, and no one moves to halt their squeals of anger and pain in the back yard, which, neglected, in time die away. Even Harry has a visitor. The doorbell rings and Mrs. Springer goes and comes into the dim room where Harry is sitting looking at magazines and says, in a surprised and injured voice, "A man for you."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She leaves the doorway and he gets up and walks a few steps forward to greet the man coming into the room, Tothero, leaning on a cane and his face half?paralyzed; but talking, walking, alive. And the baby dead. "Hi! Gee, how are you?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Harry." With the hand that is not on the cane he grips Harry's arm. He brings a long look to bear on Harry's face; his mouth is tweaked downward on one side and the skin over his eye on this side is dragged down diagonally so it nearly curtains the glitter. The gouging grip of his fingers trembles.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Let's sit down," Rabbit says, and helps him into an easy chair. Tothero knocks off a doily in arranging his arms. Rabbit brings over a straight chair and sits close so he won't have to raise his voice. "Should you be running around?" he asks when Tothero says nothing.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"My wife brought me. In the car. Outside, Harry. We heard your terrible news. Didn't I warn you?" Already his eyes are bulging with water.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"When?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"When?" The stricken side of his face is turned away, perhaps consciously, into shadow, so his smile seems wholly alive, wise, and sure. "That first night. I said go back. I begged you."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I guess you did. I've forgotten."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"No you haven't. No you haven't, Harry." His breath chuffs on the "Ha" of "Harry." "Let me tell you something. Will you listen?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Sure."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Right and wrong," he says, and stops; his big head shifts, and the stiff downward lines of his mouth and bad eye show. "Right and wrong aren't dropped from the sky. We. We make them. Against misery. Invariably, Harry, invariably" ? he grows confident of his ability to negotiate long words ?"misery follows their disobedience. Not our own, often at first not our own. Now you've had an example of that in your own life." Rabbit wonders when the tear?trails appeared on Tothero's cheeks; there they are, like snail?tracks. "Do you believe me?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Sure. Sure. Look, I know this has been my fault. I've felt like a, like an insect ever since it happened."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Tothero's tranquil smile deepens; a faint rasping purr comes out of his face. "I warned you," he says, "I warned you, Harry, but youth is deaf. Youth is careless."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Harry blurts, "But what can I do?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Tothero doesn't seem to hear. "Don't you remember? My begging you to go back?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I don't know, I guess so."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Good. Ali. You're still a fine man, Harry. You have a healthy body. When I'm dead and gone, remember how your old coach told you to avoid suffering. Remember." The last word is intoned coyly, with a little wag of the head; on the thrust of this incongruous vivacity he rises from his chair, and prevents himself from pitching forward by quick use of his cane. Harry jumps up in alarm, and the two of them stand for the moment very close. The old man's big head breathes a distressing scent, not so much medicine as a vegetable staleness. "You young people," he says with a rising intonation, a schoolteacher's tone, scolding yet sly, "tend to forget. Don't you? Now don't you?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He wants this admission mysteriously much. "Sure," Rabbit says, praying he'll go.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Harry helps him to his car, a '57 blue?and?cream Dodge waiting in front of the orange fire hydrant. Mrs. Tothero offers, rather coolly, her regrets at the death of his infant daughter. She looks harried and noble. Gray hair straggles down across her finely wrinkled silver temple. She wants to get away from here, away with her prize. Beside her on the front seat Tothero looks like a smirking gnome, brainlessly stroking the curve of his cane. Rabbit returns to the house feeling depressed and dirtied by the visit. Tothero's revelation chilled him. He wants to believe in the sky as the source of all dictates.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Eccles comes later in the afternoon, to complete the arrangements for the funeral: it will be held tomorrow afternoon, Wednesday. As he leaves Rabbit catches his attention and they talk in the front hall a moment. "What do you think?" Rabbit asks.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"About what?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"What shall I do?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Eccles glances up nervously. His face has that pale babyish look of someone who has not slept enough. "Do what you are doing," he says. "Be a good husband. A good father. Love what you have left."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"And that's enough?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You mean to earn forgiveness? I'm sure it is, carried out through a lifetime."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I mean" ? he's never before felt pleading with Eccles "remember that thing we used to talk about? The thing behind everything?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Harry, you know I don't think that thing exists in the way you think it does."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"O.K." He realizes that Eccles wants to get away too, that the sight of himself is painful, disgusting.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Eccles must see that he senses this, for he curtly summons up merry and makes an attempt. "Harry, it's not for me to forgive you. You've done nothing to me to forgive. I'm equal with you in guilt. We must work for forgiveness; we must earn the right to see that thing behind everything. Harry, I know that people are brought to Christ. I've seen it with my eyes and tasted it with my mouth. And I do think this. I think marriage is a sacrament, and that this tragedy, terrible as it is, has at last united you and Janice in a sacred way."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Through the next hours Rabbit clings to this belief, though it seems to bear no relation to the colors and sounds of the big sorrowing house, the dabs and arcs of late sunshine in the little jungle of plants on the glass table, or the almost wordless supper he and Janice share in her bedroom.</p>
