Unworn carpets of a very pale green deaden their footsteps. Little silver half?tubes on the walls shield a weak glow. The colors of the curtains and walls are atonal halfcolors, colors no one would live with, salmon and aqua and a violet like the violet that kills germs on toilet seats in gas stations. They are ushered into a little pink side room. Harry can see into the main room; on a few rows of auditorium chairs about six people sit, five of them women. The only one he knows is Peggy Gring. Her little boy wriggling beside her makes seven. It was meant to be at first nobody but the families, but the Springers then asked a few close friends. His parents are not here. Invisible hands bonelessly trail up and down the keys of an electric organ. The unnatural coloring of the interior comes to a violent head in the hothouse flowers arranged around a little white coffin. The coffin, with handles of painted gold, rests on a platform draped with a deep purple curtain; he thinks the curtain might draw apart and reveal, like a magician's trick, the living baby underneath. Janice looks in and yields a whimper and an undertaker's man, blond and young with an unnaturally red face, conjures a bottle of spirits of ammonia out of his side pocket. Her mother holds it under her nose and Janice suppresses a face of disgust; her eyebrows stretch up, showing the bumps her eyeballs make under the thin membrane. Harry takes her arm and turns her so she can't see into the next room.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The side room has a window through which they can look at the street, where children and cars are running. "Hope the minister hasn't forgotten," the young red?faced man says, and to his own embarrassment chuckles. He can't help being at his ease here. His face seems lightly rouged.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Does that happen often?" Mr. Springer asks. He is standing behind his wife, and his face tips forward with curiosity, his mouth a birdy black gash beneath his sandy mustache. Mrs. Springer has sat down on a chair and is pressing her palms against her face through the veil. The purple berries quiver on their stem of wire.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"About twice a year," is the answer.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A familiar old blue Plymouth slows against the curb outside. Rabbit's mother gets out and looks up and down the sidewalk angrily. His heart leaps and trips his tongue: "Here come my parents." They all come to attention. Mrs. Springer gets up and Harry places himself between her and Janice. Standing in formation with the Springers like this, he can at least show his mother that he's reformed, that he's accepted and been accepted. The undertaker's man goes out to bring them in; Harry can see them standing on the bright sidewalk, arguing which door to go into, Mim a little to one side. Dressed in a church sort of dress and with no makeup, she reminds him of the little sister he once had. The sight of his parents makes him wonder why he was afraid of them.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>His mother comes through the door first; her eyes sweep the line of them and she steps toward him with reaching curved arms. "Hassy, what have they done to you?" She asks this out loud and wraps him in a hug as if she would carry him back to the sky from which they have fallen.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This quick it opens, and seals shut again. In a boyish reflex of embarrassment he pushes her away and stands to his full height. As if unaware of what she has said, his mother turns and embraces Janice. Pop, murmuring, shakes Springer's hand. Mim comes and touches Harry on the shoulder and then squats and whispers to Nelson, these two the youngest. All under him Harry feels these humans knit together. His wife and mother cling together. His mother began the embrace automatically but has breathed a great life of grief into it. Her face creases in pain; Janice, rumpled and smothered, yet responds; her weak black arms try to encircle the big?boned frame yearning against her. Mary Angstrom yields up two words to her. The others are puzzled; only Harry from his tall cool height understands. His mother had been propelled by the instinct that makes us embrace those we wound, and then she had felt this girl in her arms as a woman like her and then had sensed that she too, having restored her son to himself, must be deserted.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He had felt in himself these stages of grief unfold in her as her amts tightened. Now she releases Janice, and speaks, sadly and properly, to the Springers. They have let her first outcry pass as madness. They of course have done nothing to Harry, what has been done he has done to them. His liberation is unseen by them. They become remote beside him. The words his mother spoke to Janice, "My daughter," recede. Mim rises from squatting; his father takes Nelson into his arms. Their motions softly jostle him.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>And meanwhile his heart completes its turn and turns again, a wider turn in a thinning medium to which the outer world bears a decreasing relevance.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Eccles has arrived by some other entrance and from a far doorway beckons them. The seven of them file with Nelson into the room where the flowers wait, and take their seats on the front row. Black Eccles reads before the white casket. It annoys Rabbit that Eccles should stand between him and his daughter. It occurs to him, what no one has mentioned, the child was never baptized. Eccles reads. "I am the resurrection and the life, with the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The angular words walk in Harry's head like clumsy blackbirds; he feels their possibility. Eccles doesn't; his face is humorless and tired. His voice is false. All these people are false: except his dead daughter, the white box with gold trim.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arms, and carry them in his bosom."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Shepherd, lamb, amts: Harry's eyes fill with tears. It is as if at first the tears are everywhere about him, a sea, and that at last the saltwater gets into his eyes. His daughter is dead: June gone from him; his heart swims in loss, that had skimmed over it before, dives deeper and deeper into the limitless volume of loss. Never hear her cry again, never see her marbled skin again, never cup her faint weight in his arms again and watch the blue of her eyes wander in search of the source of his voice. Never, the word never stops, there is never a gap in its thickness.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>They go to the cemetery. He and his father and Janice's father and the undertaker's man carry the white box to the hearse. There is weight to it but the weight is all wood. They get into their cars and drive through the streets uphill. The town hushes around them; a woman comes out on her porch with a basket of wash and waits there, a small boy stops himself in the middle of throwing a ball to watch them pass. They pass between two granite pillars linked by an arch of wrought iron. The cemetery is beautiful at four o'clock. Its nurtured green nap slopes down somewhat parallel to the rays of the sun. Tombstones cast long slate shadows. Up a crunching blue gravel lane the procession moves in second gear, its destination a meek green canopy smelling of earth and ferns. The cars stop; they get out. Beyond them at a distance stands a crescent sweep of black woods; the cemetery is high on the mountains, between the town and the forest. Below their feet chimneys smoke. A man on a power lawnmower rides between the worn teeth of tombstones near the far hedge. Swallows in a wide ball dip and toss themselves above a stone cottage, a crypt. The white coffin is artfully rolled on casters from the hearse's resonant body onto crimson straps that hold it above the small nearly square but deep?dug grave. The small creaks and breaths of effort scratch on a pane of silence. Silence. A cough. The flowers have followed them; here they are, densely banked within the tent. Behind Harry's feet a neat mound of dirt topped with squares of sod waits to be replaced and meanwhile breathes a deep word of earth. The undertaking men look pleased, their job near done, and fold their gloved hands in front of their flies. Silence.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"The Lord is my shepherd: therefore can I lack nothing."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Eccles' voice is fragile outdoors. The distant buzz of the power mower halts respectfully. Rabbit's chest vibrates with excitement and strength; he is sure his girl has ascended to Heaven. This feeling fills Eccles' recited words like a living body a skin. "O God, whose most dear Son did take little children into his arms and bless them; Give us Grace, we beseech thee, to entrust the soul of this child to thy never?failing care and love, and bring us all to the heavenly kingdom; through the same thy Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Amen," Mrs. Springer whispers.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Yes. That is how it is. He feels them all, the heads as still around him as tombstones, he feels them all one, all one with the grass, with the hothouse flowers, all, the undertaker's men, the unseen caretaker who has halted his mower, all gathered into one here to give his unbaptized baby force to leap to Heaven.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>An electric switch is turned, the straps begin to lower the casket into the grave and stop. Eccles makes a cross of sand on the lid. Stray grains roll one by one down the curved lid into the hole. An ungloved hand throws crumpled petals. "Deal graciously, we pray thee, with all those who mourn, that, casting every care on thee . . ." The straps whine again. Janice at his side staggers. He holds her arm and even through the cloth it feels hot. A small breath of wind makes the canopy fill and tuff. The smell of flowers rises toward them. ". . . and the Holy Ghost, bless you and keep you, now and for evermore. Amen."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Eccles closes his book. Harry's father and Janice's, standing side by side, look up and blink. The undertaker's men begin to be busy with their equipment, retrieving the straps from the hole. Mourners move into the sunshine. Casting every care on thee . . . The sky greets him. A strange strength sinks down into him. It is as if he has been crawling in a cave and now at last beyond the dark recession of crowding rocks he has seen a patch of light; he turns, and Janice's face, dumb with grief, blocks the light. "Don't look at me," he says. "I didn't kill her."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This comes out of his mouth clearly, in tune with the simplicity he feels now in everything. Heads talking softly snap around at a voice so sudden and cruel.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>They misunderstand. He just wants this straight. He explains to the heads, "You all keep acting as if 1 did it. I wasn't anywhere near. She's the one." He turns to her, and her face, slack as if slapped, seems hopelessly removed from him. "Hey it's O.K.," he tells her. "You didn't mean to." He tries to take her hand but she snatches it back like from a trap and looks toward her parents, who step toward her.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>His face burns. His embarrassment is savage. Forgiveness had been big in his heart and now it's hate. He hates his wife's face. She doesn't see. She had a chance to join him in truth, just the simplest factual truth, and she turned away. He sees that among the heads even his own mother's is horrified, blank with shock, a wall against him; she asks him what have they done to him and then she does it too. A suffocating sense of injustice blinds him. He turns and runs.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Uphill exultantly. He dodges among gravestones. Dandelions grow bright as butter among the graves. Behind him his name is called in Eccles' voice: "Harry! Harry!" He feels Eccles chasing him but does not turn to look. He cuts diagonally through the stones across the grass toward the woods. The distance to the dark crescent of trees is greater than it seemed from beside the grave. The romping of his body turns heavy; the slope of land grows steeper. Yet there is a resilience in the burial ground that sustains his flight, a gentle settled bumpiness that buoys him up with its memory of the dodging spurting runs down a crowded court. He arrives between the amts of the woods and aims for the center of the crescent. Once inside, he is less sheltered than he expected; turning, he can see through the leaves back down the graveyard to where, beside the small green tent, the human beings he had left cluster. Eccles is halfway between them and him. He has stopped running. His black chest heaves. His wide?set eyes concentrate into the woods. The others, thick stalks in dark clothes, jiggle: maneuvering, planning, testing each other's strengths, holding each other up. Their pale faces flash mute signals toward the woods and turn away, in disgust or despair, and then flash again full in the declining sun, fascinated. Only Eccles' gaze is steady. He may be gathering energy to renew the chase.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Rabbit crouches and runs raggedly. His hands and face are scratched from plowing through the bushes and saplings that rim the woods. Deeper inside there is more space. The pine trees smother all other growth. Their brown needles muffle the rough earth with a slippery blanket; sunshine falls in narrow slots on this dead floor. It is dim but hot in here, like an attic; the unseen afternoon sun bakes the dark shingles of green above his head. Dead lower branches thrust at the level of his eyes. His hands and face feel hot where they were scratched. He turns to see if he has left the people behind. No one is following. Far off, down at the end of the aisle of pines he is in, a green glows which is perhaps the green of the cemetery; but it seems as far off as the patches of sky that flicker through the treetops. In fuming he loses some sense of direction. But the tree?trunks are at first in neat rows that carry him along between them, and he walks always against the slope of the land. If he walks far enough uphill he will in time reach the scenic drive that runs along the ridge. Only by going downhill can he be returned to the others.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The trees cease to march in rows and grow together more thickly. These are older trees. The darkness under them is denser and the ground is steeper. Rocks jut up through the blanket of needles, scabby with lichen; collapsed trunks hold intricate claws across the path. At places where a hole has been opened up in a roof of evergreen, prickly bushes and yellow grasses grow in a hasty sweet?smelling tumble, and midges swarm. These patches, some of them broad enough to catch a bit of the sun slanting down the mountainside, make the surrounding darkness darker, and in pausing in them Rabbit becomes conscious, by its cessation, of a whisper that fills the brown tunnels all around him. The surrounding trees are too tall for him to see any sign, even a remote cleared landscape, of civilization. Islanded in light, he becomes frightened. He is conspicuous; the bears and nameless menaces that whisper through the forest can see him clearly. Rather than hang vulnerable in these wells of visibility he rushes toward the menace, across the rocks and rotting trunks and slithering needles. Insects follow him out of the sun; his sweat is a strong perfume. His chest binds and his shins hurt from jarring uphill into pits and flat rocks that the needles conceal. He takes off his binding hot blue coat and carries it in a twisted bundle. He struggles against his impulse to keep fuming his head, to see what is behind him; there is never anything, just the hushed, deathly life of the woods, but his fear fills the winding space between the tree?trunks with agile threats that just dodge out of the corner of his eye each time he whips his head around. He must hold his head rigid. He's terrorizing himself. As a kid he often went up through the woods. But maybe as a kid he walked under a protection that has now been lifted; he can't believe the woods were this dark then. They too have grown. Such an unnatural darkness, clogged with spider?fine twigs that finger his face incessantly, a darkness in defiance of the broad daylight whose sky leaps in jagged patches from treetop to treetop above him like a silent monkey.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The small of his back aches from crouching. He begins to doubt his method. As a kid he never entered from the cemetery. Perhaps walking against the steepest slope is stupid, carrying him along below the ridge of the mountain when a few yards to his left the road is running. He bears to his left, trying to keep himself in a straight path; the whisper of woods seems to swell louder and his heart lifts with hope: he was right, he is near a road. He hurries on, scrambling wildly, expecting the road to appear with every step, its white posts and speeding metal to gleam. The slope of the ground dies unnoticed under his feet. He stops, stunned, on the edge of a precipitate hollow whose near bank is strewn with the hairy bodies of dead trees locked against trunks that have managed to cling erect to the steep soil and that cast into the hollow a shadow as deep as the last stage of twilight. Something rectangular troubles this gloom; it dawns on him that on the floor of the hollow lie the cellarhole and the crumbled sandstone walls of a forgotten house. To his shrill annoyance at having lost his way and headed himself downhill again is added a clangorous fear, as if this ruined evidence of a human intrusion into a world of blind life tolls bells that ring to the edges of the universe. The thought that this place was once self?conscious, that its land was tramped and cleared and known, blackens the air with ghosts that climb the ferry bank toward him like children clambering up from a grave. Perhaps there were children, fat girls in calico fetching water from a spring, boys scarring the trees with marks of play, growing old on boards stretched above the cellarhole, dying with a last look out the window at the bank where Rabbit stands. He feels more conspicuous and vulnerable than in the little clearings of sunshine; he obscurely feels lit by a great spark, the spark whereby the blind tumble of matter recognized itself, a spark struck in an encounter a terrible God willed. His stomach slides; his ears seem suddenly open to the sound of a voice. He scrambles back uphill, thrashing noisily in the deepening darkness to drown out the voice that wants to cry out to him from a source that flits from tree to tree in the shadows. In the treacherous light the slope of land is like some fleeing, dodging creature.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The light widens enough for him to spy off to his right a nest of old tin cans and bottles sunken into the needles. He is safe. He strikes the road. He jacks his long legs over the guard fence and straightens up. Gold spots are switching on and off in the comets of his eyes. The asphalt scrapes under his shoes and he seems entered, panting, on a new life. Chilly air strokes his shoulder blades; somewhere in there he split old man Springer's shirt right down the back. He has come out of the woods about a half?mile below the Pinnacle Hotel. As he swings along, jauntily hanging his blue coat over his shoulder on the hook of one finger, Janice and Eccles and his mother and his sins seem a thousand miles behind. He decides to call Eccles, like you'd send somebody a postcard. Eccles had liked him and put a lot of trust in him and deserves at least a phone call. Rabbit rehearses what he'll say. It's O.K., he'll tell him, I'm on the way. I mean, I think there are several ways; don't worry. Thanks for everything. What he wants to get across is that Eccles shouldn't be discouraged.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On the top of the mountain it is still broad day. Up in the sea of sky a lake of fragmented mackerel clouds drifts in one piece like a school of fish. There are only a couple cars parked around the hotel, jalopies, 'S2 Pontiacs and 'S1 Mercs like Springer Motors sells to these blotchy kids that come in with a stripper in their wallets and a hundred dollars in the bank. Inside the cafeteria a few of them are playing a pinball machine called BOUNCING BETSY. They look at him and make wise faces and one of the boys even calls, "Did she rip your shirt?" But, it's strange, they don't really know anything about him except he looks mussed. You do things and do things and nobody really has a clue. The clock says twenty of six. He goes to the pay?phone on the mustard?colored wall and looks up Eccles' number in the book.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>His wife answers dryly, "Hello?" Rabbit shuts his eyes and her freckles dance in the red of his lids.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Hi. Could I speak to Reverend Eccles please?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Who is this?" Her voice has gotten up on a hard little high horse; she knows who.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Hey, this is Harry Angstrom. Is Jack there?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The receiver at the other end of the line is replaced. That bitch. Poor Eccles probably sitting there his heart bleeding to hear the word from me and she going back and telling him wrong number, that poor bastard being married to that bitch. He hangs up himself, hears the dime rattle down, and feels simplified by this failure. He goes out across the parking lot.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He seems to leave behind him in the cafeteria all the poison she must be dripping into the poor tired guy's ears. He imagines her telling Eccles about how he slapped her fanny and thinks he hears Eccles laughing and himself smiles. He'll remember Eccles as laughing; there was that in him that held you off, that you couldn't reach, the nasal official business, but through the laughter you could get to him. Sort of sneaking in behind him, past the depressing damp clinging front. What made it depressing was that he wasn't sure, but couldn't tell you, and worried his eyebrows instead, and spoke every word in a different voice. All in all, a relief to be free of him.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From the edge of the parking lot, Brewer is spread out like a carpet, its flowerpot red going dusty. Some lights are already turned on. The great neon sunflower at the center of the city looks small as a daisy. Now the low clouds are pink but up above, high in the dome, tails of cirrus still hang pale and pure. As he starts down the steps he wonders, Would she have? Lucy. Are ministers' wives frigid? Like du Ponts.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He goes down the mountainside on the flight of log stairs and through the park, where some people are still playing tennis, and down Weiser Street. He puts his coat back on and walks up Summer. His heart is murmuring in suspense but it is in the center of his chest. That lopsided kink about Becky is gone, he has put her in Heaven, he felt her go. If Janice had felt it he would have stayed. Or would he? The outer door is open and an old lady in a Polish sort of kerchief is coming mumbling out of F. X. Pelligrini's door. He rings Ruth's bell.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The buzzer answers and he quickly snaps open the inner door and starts up the steps. Ruth comes to the banister and looks down and says, "Go away."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Huh? How'd you know it was me?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Go back to your wife."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I can't. I just left her."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He has climbed to the step next to the top one, and their faces are on a level. "You're always leaving her," she says.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"No, this time it's different. It's really bad."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You're bad all around. You're bad with me, too."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Why?" He has come up the last step and stands there a yard away from her, excited and helpless. He thought when he saw her, instnct would tell him what to do but in a way it's all new, though it's only been a few weeks. She is changed, graver in her motions and thicker in the waist. The blue of her eyes is no longer blank.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She looks at him with a contempt that is totally new. "Why?" she repeats in an incredulous hard voice.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Let me guess," he says. "You're pregnant."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Surprise softens the hardness a moment.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"That's great," he says, and takes advantage of her softness to push her ahead of him into the room. Just from the touches of pushing he remembers what Ruth feels like in his arms. "Great," he repeats, closing the door. He tries to embrace her and she fights him successfully and backs away behind a chair. She had meant that fight; his neck is scraped.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Go away," she says. "Go away."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Don't you need me?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Need you," she cries, and he squints in pain at the straining note of hysteria; he feels she has imagined this encounter so often she is determined to say everything, which will be too much. He sits down in an easy chair. His legs ache. She says, "I needed you that night you walked out. Remember how much I needed you? Remember what you made me do?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"She was in the hospital," he says. "I had to go."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"God, you're cute. God, you're so holy. You had to go. You had to stay, too, didn't you? You know, I was stupid enough to think you'd at least call."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I wanted to but I was trying to start clean. I didn't know you were pregnant."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You didn't, why not? Anybody else would have. I was sick enough."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"When, with me?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"God, yes. Why don't you look outside your own pretty skin once in a while?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Well why didn't you tell me?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Why should I? What would that have done? You're no help. You're nothing. You know why I didn't? You'll laugh, but I didn't because I thought you'd leave me if you knew. You wouldn't ever let me do anything to prevent it but I figured once it happened you'd leave me. You left me anyway so there you are. Why don't you get out? Please get out. I begged you to get out the first time. The damn first time I begged you. Why are you here?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I want to be here. It's right. Look. I'm happy you're pregnant."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"It's too fucking late to be happy."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Why? Why is it too late?" He's frightened, remembering how she wasn't here when he came before. She's here now, she had been away then. Women went away to have it done, he knew. There was a place in Philadelphia even the kids in high school had known about.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"How can you sit there?" she asks him. "I can't understand it, how you can sit there; you just killed your baby and there you sit."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Who told you that?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Your ministerial friend. Your fellow saint. He called about a half?hour ago."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"God. He's still trying."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I said you weren't here. I said you'd never be here."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I didn't kill the poor kid. Janice did. I got mad at her one night and came looking for you and she got drunk and drowned the poor kid in the bathtub. Don't make me talk about it. Where were you, anyway."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She looks at him with dull wonder and says softly, "Boy, you really have the touch of death, don't you?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Hey; have you done something?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Hold still. Just sit there. I see you very clear all of a sudden. You're Mr. Death himself: You're not just nothing, you're worse than nothing. You're not a rat, you don't stink, you're not enough to stink."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Look, I didn't do anything. I was coming to see you when it happened."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"No, you don't do anything. You just wander around with the kiss of death. Get out. Honest to God, Rabbit, just looking at you makes me sick. Her sincerity in saying this leaves her so limp that for support she grips the top slat of the back of a straight chair one of the chairs they used to sit in to eat ?and leans forward over it, open?mouthed and staring.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He, who always took a pride in dressing neatly, who had always been led to think he was all right to look at, blushes to feel this sincerity. The sensation he had counted on, of being by nature her mate, of getting on top of her, hasn't come. He looks at his fingernails, with their big cuticle moons. His hands and legs are suffused with a paralyzing sensation of reality; his child is really dead, his day is really done, this woman is really sickened by him. Realizing this much makes him anxious to have all of it, to go as far in this direction as he can. He asks her flat, "Did you get an abortion?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She smirks and says hoarsely, "What do you think?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He closes his eyes and while the gritty grained fur of the chair arms rushes up against his fingertips he prays, God, dear God, no, not another, you have one, let this one go. A dirty knife turns in his intricate inner darkness. When he opens his eyes he sees, from the tentative hovering way she is standing there, trying to bring off a hard swagger in her stance, that she means to torment him. His voice goes sharp with hope: "Have you?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A crumbling film comes over her face. "No," she says, "no. I should but I keep not doing it. I don't want to do it."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Up he gets and his amts go around her, without squeezing, like a magic ring, and though she stiffens at his touch and twists her head sideways on her muscled white throat, he has regained that feeling, of being on top. "Oh," he says, "good. That's so good."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"It was too ugly," she says. "Margaret had it all rigged up but I kept ?thinking about ="</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Yes," he says. "Yes. You're so good. I'm so glad," and tries to nuzzle the side of her face. His nose touches wet. "You have it," he coaxes. "Have it." She is still a moment, staring at her thoughts, and then jerks out of his arms and says, "Don't touch me!" Her face flares; her body is bent forward like a threatened animal's. As if his touch is death.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I love you," he says.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"That means nothing from you. Have it, have it, you say: how? Will you marry me?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I'd love to."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You'd love to. You'd love to be the man in the moon, too. What about your wife? What about the boy you already have?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I don't know."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Will you divorce her? No. You love being married to her too. You love being married to everybody. Why can't you make up your mind what you want to do?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Can't I? I don't know."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"How would you support me? How many wives can you support? Your jobs are a joke. You aren't worth hiring. Maybe once you could play basketball but you can't do anything now. What the hell do you think the world is?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Please have the baby," he says. "You got to have it."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Why? Why do you care?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I don't know. I don't know any of these answers. All I know is what feels right. You feel right to me. Sometimes Janice used to. Sometimes nothing does."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Who cares? That's the thing. Who cares what you feel?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I don't know," he says again.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She groans ? from her face he feared she would spit ? and turns and looks at the wall that is all in bumps from being painted over peeling previous coats so often.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He says, "I'm hungry. Why don't I go out to the delicatessen and get us something. Then we can think."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She turns, steadier. "I've been thinking," she says. "You know where I was when you came here the other day? I was with my parents. You know I have parents. They're pretty poor parents but that's what they are. They live in West Brewer. They know. I mean they know some things. They know I'm pregnant. Pregnant's a nice word, it happens to everybody, you don't have to think too much what you must do to get that way. Now I'd like to marry you. I would. I mean whatever I said but if we're married it'll be all right. Now you work it out. You divorce that wife you feel so sorry for about once a month, you divorce her or forget me. If you can't work it out, I'm dead to you; I'm dead to you and this baby of yours is dead too. Now: get out if you want to." Saying all this unsteadies her and makes her cry, but she pretends she's not. She grips the back of the chair, the sides of her nose shining, and looks at him to say something. The way she ís fighting for control of herself repels him; he doesn't like people who manage things. He likes things to happen of themselves.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He has nervously felt her watching him for some sign of resolution inspired by her speech. In fact he has hardly listened; it is too complicated and, compared to the vision of a sandwich, unreal. He stands up, he hopes with soldierly effect, and says, "That's fair. I'll work it out. What do you want at the store?" A sandwich and a glass of milk, and then undressing her, getting her out of that cotton dress harried into wrinkles and seeing that thickened waist calm in its pale cool skin. He loves women when they're first pregnant; a kind of dawn comes over their bodies. If he can just once more bury himself in her he knows he'll come up with his nerves all combed.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I don't want anything," she says.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Oh you got to eat," he says.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I've eaten," she says.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He tries to kiss her but she says "No" and does not look inviting, fat and flushed and her many?colored hair straggled and damp.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I'll be right back," he says.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As he goes down the stairs worries come as quick as the click of his footsteps. Janice, money, Eccles' phone call, the look on his mother's face all clatter together in sharp dark waves; guilt and responsibility slide together like two substantial shadows inside his chest. The mere engineering of it ? the conversations, the phone calls, the lawyers, the finances ? seems to complicate, physically, in front of his mouth, s., he is conscious of the effort of breathing, and every action, just reaching for the doorknob, feels like a precarious extension of along mechanical sequence insecurely linked to his heart. The doorknob's solidity answers his touch, and turns with a silky click.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Outside in the air his fears condense. Globes of ether, pure nervousness, slide down his legs. The sense of outside space scoops at his chest. Standing on the step he tries to sort out his worries. Two thoughts comfort him, let a little light through the dense pack of impossible alternatives. Ruth has parents, and she will let his baby live; two thoughts that are perhaps the same thought, the vertical order of parenthood, a kind of thin tube upright in time in which our solitude is somewhat diluted. Ruth and Janice both have parents: on this excuse he dissolves them both. Nelson remains: here is a hardness he must carry with him. On this small fulcrum he tries to balance the rest, weighing opposites against each other: Janice and Ruth, Eccles and his mother, the right way and the good way, the way to the delicatessen ? gaudy with stacked fruit lit by a naked bulb ? and the other way, down Summer Street to where the city ends. He tries to picture how it will end, with an empty baseball field, a dark factory, and then over a brook into a dirt road, he doesn't know. He pictures a huge vacant field of cinders and his heart goes hollow.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Afraid, really afraid, he remembers what once consoled him by seeming to make a hole where he looked through into under lying brightness, and lifts his eyes to the church window. It is, because of church poverty or the late summer nights or just carelessness, unlit, a dark circle in a limestone facade.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There is light, though, in the streetlights; muffled by trees their mingling cones retreat to the unseen end of Summer Street. Nearby, to his left, directly under one, the rough asphalt looks like dimpled snow. He decides to walk around the block, to clear his head and pick his path. Funny, how what makes you move is so simple and the field you must move in is so crowded. His legs take strength from the distinction, scissor along evenly. Goodness lies inside, there is nothing outside, those things he was trying to balance have no weight. He feels his inside as very real suddenly, a pure blank space in the middle of a dense net. 1 don't know, he kept telling Ruth; he doesn't know, what to do, where to go, what will happen, the thought that he doesn't know seems to make him infinitely small and impossible to capture. Its smallness fills him like a vastness. It's like when they heard you were great and put two men on you and no matter which way you turned you bumped into one of them and the only thing to do was pass. So you passed and the ball belonged to the others and your hands were empty and the men on you looked foolish because in effect there was nobody there.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Rabbit comes to the curb but instead of going to his right and around the block he steps down, with as big a feeling as if this little sidestreet is a wide river, and crosses. He wants to travel to the next patch of snow. Although this block of brick three?stories is just like the one he left, something in it makes him happy; the steps and windowsills seem to twitch and shift in the corner of his eye, alive. This illusion trips him. His hands lift of their own and he feels the wind on his ears even before, his heels hitting heavily on the pavement at first but with an effortless gathering out of a kind of sweet panic growing lighter and quicker and quieter, he runs. Ah: runs. Runs.</p>
