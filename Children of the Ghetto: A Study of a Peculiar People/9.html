Dutch Debby was a tall sallow ungainly girl who lived in the wee back room on the second floor behind Mrs. Simons and supported herself and her dog by needle-work. Nobody ever came to see her, for it was whispered that her parents had cast her out when she presented them with an illegitimate grandchild. The baby was fortunate enough to die, but she still continued to incur suspicion by keeping a dog, which is an un-Jewish trait. Bobby often squatted on the stairs guarding her door and, as it was very dark on the staircase, Esther suffered great agonies lest she should tread on his tail and provoke reprisals. Her anxiety led her to do so one afternoon and Bobby's teeth just penetrated through her stocking. The clamor brought out Dutch Debby, who took the girl into her room and soothed her. Esther had often wondered what uncanny mysteries lay behind that dark dog-guarded door and she was rather more afraid of Debby than of Bobby.</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But that afternoon saw the beginning of a friendship which added one to the many factors which were moulding the future woman. For Debby turned out a very mild bogie, indeed, with a good English vocabulary and a stock of old _London Journals_, more precious to Esther than mines of Ind. Debby kept them under the bed, which, as the size of the bed all but coincided with the area of the room, was a wise arrangement. And on the long summer evenings and the Sunday afternoons when her little ones needed no looking after and were traipsing about playing "whoop!" and pussy-cat in the street downstairs, Esther slipped into the wee back room, where the treasures lay, and there, by the open window, overlooking the dingy back yard and the slanting perspectives of sun-decked red tiles where cats prowled and dingy sparrows hopped, in an atmosphere laden with whiffs from a neighboring dairyman's stables, Esther lost herself in wild tales of passion and romance. She frequently read them aloud for the benefit of the sallow-faced needle-woman, who had found romance square so sadly with the realities of her own existence. And so all a summer afternoon, Dutch Debby and Esther would be rapt away to a world of brave men and fair women, a world of fine linen and purple, of champagne and wickedness and cigarettes, a world where nobody worked or washed shirts or was hungry or had holes in boots, a world utterly ignorant of Judaism and the heinousness of eating meat with butter. Not that Esther for her part correlated her conception of this world with facts. She never realized that it was an actually possible world--never indeed asked herself whether it existed outside print or not. She never thought of it in that way at all, any more than it ever occurred to her that people once spoke the Hebrew she learned to read and translate. "Bobby" was often present at these readings, but he kept his thoughts to himself, sitting on his hind legs with his delightfully ugly nose tilted up inquiringly at Esther. For the best of all this new friendship was that Bobby was not jealous. He was only a sorry dun-colored mongrel to outsiders, but Esther learned to see him almost through Dutch Debby's eyes. And she could run up the stairs freely, knowing that if she trod on his tail now, he would take it as a mark of _camaraderie_.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I used to pay a penny a week for the _London Journal_," said Debby early in their acquaintanceship, "till one day I discovered I had a dreadful bad memory."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And what was the good of that?" said Esther.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Why, it was worth shillings and shillings to me. You see I used to save up all the back numbers of the _London Journal_ because of the answers to correspondents, telling you how to do your hair and trim your nails and give yourself a nice complexion. I used to bother my head about that sort of thing in those days, dear; and one day I happened to get reading a story in a back number only about a year old and I found I was just as interested as if I had never read it before and I hadn't the slightest remembrance of it. After that I left off buying the _Journal_ and took to reading my big heap of back numbers. I get through them once every two years." Debby interrupted herself with a fit of coughing, for lengthy monologue is inadvisable for persons who bend over needle-work in dark back rooms. Recovering herself, she added, "And then I start afresh. You couldn't do that, could you?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No," admitted Esther, with a painful feeling of inferiority. "I remember all I've ever read."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Ah, you will grow up a clever woman!" said Debby, patting her hair.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, do you think so?" said Esther, her dark eyes lighting up with pleasure.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh yes, you're always first in your class, ain't you?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Is that what you judge by, Debby?" said Esther, disappointed. "The other girls are so stupid and take no thought for anything but their hats and their frocks. They would rather play gobs or shuttlecock or hopscotch than read about the 'Forty Thieves.' They don't mind being kept a whole year in one class but I--oh, I feel so mad at getting on so slow. I could easily learn the standard work in three months. I want to know everything--so that I can grow up to be a teacher at our school."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And does your teacher know everything?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh yes! She knows the meaning of every word and all about foreign countries."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And would you like to be a teacher?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "If I could only be clever enough!" sighed Esther. "But then you see the teachers at our school are real ladies and they dress, oh, so beautifully! With fur tippets and six-button gloves. I could never afford it, for even when I was earning five shillings a week I should have to give most of it to father and the children."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But if you're very good--I dare say some of the great ladies like the Rothschilds will buy you nice clothes. I have heard they are very good to clever children."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, then the other teachers would know I was getting charity! And they would mock at me. I heard Miss Hyams make fun of a teacher because she wore the same dress as last winter. I don't think I should like to be a teacher after all, though it is nice to be able to stand with your back to the fire in the winter. The girls would know--'" Esther stopped and blushed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Would know what, dear?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, they would know father," said Esther in low tones. "They would see him selling things in the Lane and they wouldn't do what I told them."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Nonsense, Esther. I believe most of the teachers' fathers are just as bad--I mean as poor. Look at Miss Hyams's own father."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh Debby! I do hope that's true. Besides when I was earning five shillings a week, I could buy father a new coat, couldn't I? And then there would be no need for him to stand in the Lane with lemons or 'four-corner fringes,' would there?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, dear. You shall be a teacher, I prophesy, and who knows? Some day you may be Head Mistress!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Esther laughed a startled little laugh of delight, with a suspicion of a sob in it. "What! Me! Me go round and make all the teachers do their work. Oh, wouldn't I catch them gossiping! I know their tricks!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You seem to look after your teacher well. Do you ever call her over the coals for gossiping?" inquired Dutch Debby, amused.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, no," protested Esther quite seriously. "I like to hear them gossiping. When my teacher and Miss Davis, who's in the next room, and a few other teachers get together, I learn--Oh such a lot!--from their conversation."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then they do teach you after all," laughed Debby.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, but it's not on the Time Table," said Esther, shaking her little head sapiently. "It's mostly about young men. Did you ever have a young man, Debby?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Don't--don't ask such questions, child!" Debby bent over her needle-work.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Why not?" persisted Esther. "If I only had a young man when I grew up, I should be proud of him. Yes, you're trying to turn your head away. I'm sure you had. Was he nice like Lord Eversmonde or Captain Andrew Sinclair? Why you're crying, Debby!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Don't be a little fool, Esther! A tiny fly has just flown into my eye--poor little thing! He hurts me and does himself no good."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Let me see, Debby," said Esther. "Perhaps I shall be in time to save him."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, don't trouble."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Don't be so cruel, Debby. You're as bad as Solomon, who pulls off flies' wings to see if they can fly without them."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He's dead now. Go on with 'Lady Ann's Rival;' we've been wasting the whole afternoon talking. Take my advice, Esther, and don't stuff your head with ideas about young men. You're too young. Now, dear, I'm ready. Go on."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Where was I? Oh yes. 'Lord Eversmonde folded the fair young form to his manly bosom and pressed kiss after kiss upon her ripe young lips, which responded passionately to his own. At last she recovered herself and cried reproachfully, Oh Sigismund, why do you persist in coming here, when the Duke forbids it?' Oh, do you know, Debby, father said the other day I oughtn't to come here?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh no, you must," cried Debby impulsively. "I couldn't part with you now."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Father says people say you are not good," said Esther candidly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Debby breathed painfully. "Well!" she whispered.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But I said people were liars. You _are_ good!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, Esther, Esther!" sobbed Debby, kissing the earnest little face with a vehemence that surprised the child.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I think father only said that," Esther went on, "because he fancies I neglect Sarah and Isaac when he's at _Shool_ and they quarrel so about their birthdays when they're together. But they don't slap one another hard. I'll tell you what! Suppose I bring Sarah down here!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, but won't she cry and be miserable here, if you read, and with no Isaac to play with?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh no," said Esther confidently. "She'll keep Bobby company."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Bobby took kindly to little Sarah also. He knew no other dogs and in such circumstances a sensible animal falls back on human beings. He had first met Debby herself quite casually and the two lonely beings took to each other. Before that meeting Dutch Debby was subject to wild temptations. Once she half starved herself and put aside ninepence a week for almost three months and purchased one-eighth of a lottery ticket from Sugarman the _Shadchan_, who recognized her existence for the occasion. The fortune did not come off.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Debby saw less and less of Esther as the months crept on again towards winter, for the little girl feared her hostess might feel constrained to offer her food, and the children required more soothing. Esther would say very little about her home life, though Debby got to know a great deal about her school-mates and her teacher.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 One summer evening after Esther had passed into the hands of Miss Miriam Hyams she came to Dutch Debby with a grave face and said: "Oh, Debby. Miss Hyams is not a heroine."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No?" said Debby, amused. "You were so charmed with her at first."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, she is very pretty and her hats are lovely. But she is not a heroine."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Why, what's happened?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You know what lovely weather it's been all day?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, this morning all in the middle of the Scripture lesson, she said to us, 'What a pity, girls, we've got to stay cooped up here this bright weather'--you know she chats to us so nicely--'in some schools they have half-holidays on Wednesday afternoons in the summer. Wouldn't it be nice if we could have them and be out in the sunshine in Victoria Park?' 'Hoo, yes, teacher, wouldn't that be jolly?' we all cried. Then teacher said: 'Well, why not ask the Head Mistress for a holiday this afternoon? You're the highest standard in the school--I dare say if you ask for it, the whole school will get a holiday. Who will be spokes-woman?' Then all the girls said I must be because I was the first girl in the class and sounded all my h's, and when the Head Mistress came into the room I up and curtseyed and asked her if we could have a holiday this afternoon on account of the beautiful sunshine. Then the Head Mistress put on her eye-glasses and her face grew black and the sunshine seemed to go out of the room. And she said 'What! After all the holidays we have here, a month at New Year and a fortnight at Passover, and all the fast-days! I am surprised that you girls should be so lazy and idle and ask for more. Why don't you take example by your teacher? Look at Miss Hyams." We all looked at Miss Hyams, but she was looking for some papers in her desk. 'Look how Miss Hyams works!' said the Head Mistress. '_She_ never grumbles, _she_ never asks for a holiday!' We all looked again at Miss Hyams, but she hadn't yet found the papers. There was an awful silence; you could have heard a pin drop. There wasn't a single cough or rustle of a dress. Then the Head Mistress turned to me and she said: 'And you, Esther Ansell, whom I always thought so highly of, I'm surprised at your being the ringleader in such a disgraceful request. You ought to know better. I shall bear it in mind, Esther Ansell.' With that she sailed out, stiff and straight as a poker, and the door closed behind her with a bang."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, and what did Miss Hyams say then?" asked Debby, deeply interested.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "She said: 'Selina Green, and what did Moses do when the Children of Israel grumbled for water?' She just went on with the Scripture lesson, as if nothing had happened."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I should tell the Head Mistress who sent me on," cried Debby indignantly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, no," said Esther shaking her head. "That would be mean. It's a matter for her own conscience. Oh, but I do wish," she concluded, "we had had a holiday. It would have been so lovely out in the Park."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Victoria Park was _the_ Park to the Ghetto. A couple of miles off, far enough to make a visit to it an excursion, it was a perpetual blessing to the Ghetto. On rare Sunday afternoons the Ansell family minus the _Bube_ toiled there and back _en masse_, Moses carrying Isaac and Sarah by turns upon his shoulder. Esther loved the Park in all weathers, but best of all in the summer, when the great lake was bright and busy with boats, and the birds twittered in the leafy trees and the lobelias and calceolarias were woven into wonderful patterns by the gardeners. Then she would throw herself down on the thick grass and look up in mystic rapture at the brooding blue sky and forget to read the book she had brought with her, while the other children chased one another about in savage delight. Only once on a Saturday afternoon when her father was not with them, did she get Dutch Debby to break through her retired habits and accompany them, and then it was not summer but late autumn. There was an indefinable melancholy about the sere landscape. Russet refuse strewed the paths and the gaunt trees waved fleshless arms in the breeze. The November haze rose from the moist ground and dulled the blue of heaven with smoky clouds amid which the sun, a red sailless boat, floated at anchor among golden and crimson furrows and glimmering far-dotted fleeces. The small lake was slimy, reflecting the trees on its borders as a network of dirty branches. A solitary swan ruffled its plumes and elongated its throat, doubled in quivering outlines beneath the muddy surface. All at once the splash of oars was heard and the sluggish waters were stirred by the passage of a boat in which a heroic young man was rowing a no less heroic young woman.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Dutch Debby burst into tears and went home. After that she fell back entirely on Bobby and Esther and the _London Journal_ and never even saved up nine shillings again.
