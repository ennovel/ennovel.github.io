In the eighteenth century Israel Baal Shem, "the Master of the Name," retired to the mountains to meditate on philosophical truths. He arrived at a creed of cheerful and even stoical acceptance of the Cosmos in all its aspects and a conviction that the incense of an enjoyed pipe was grateful to the Creator. But it is the inevitable misfortune of religious founders to work apocryphal miracles and to raise up an army of disciples who squeeze the teaching of their master into their own mental moulds and are ready to die for the resultant distortion. It is only by being misunderstood that a great man can have any influence upon his kind. Baal Shem was succeeded by an army of thaumaturgists, and the wonder-working Rabbis of Sadagora who are in touch with all the spirits of the air enjoy the revenue of princes and the reverence of Popes. To snatch a morsel of such a Rabbi's Sabbath _Kuggol_, or pudding, is to insure Paradise, and the scramble is a scene to witness. _Chasidism_ is the extreme expression of Jewish optimism. The Chasidim are the Corybantes or Salvationists of Judaism. In England their idiosyncrasies are limited to noisy jubilant services in their _Chevrah_, the worshippers dancing or leaning or standing or writhing or beating their heads against the wall as they will, and frisking like happy children in the presence of their Father.</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Meckisch also danced at home and sang "Tiddy, riddy, roi, toi, toi, toi, ta," varied by "Rom, pom, pom" and "Bim, bom" in a quaint melody to express his personal satisfaction with existence. He was a weazened little widower with a deep yellow complexion, prominent cheek bones, a hook nose and a scrubby, straggling little beard. Years of professional practice as a mendicant had stamped his face with an anguished suppliant conciliatory grin, which he could not now erase even after business hours. It might perhaps have yielded to soap and water but the experiment had not been tried. On his head he always wore a fur cap with lappets for his ears. Across his shoulders was strung a lemon-basket filled with grimy, gritty bits of sponge which nobody ever bought. Meckisch's merchandise was quite other. He dealt in sensational spectacle. As he shambled along with extreme difficulty and by the aid of a stick, his lower limbs which were crossed in odd contortions appeared half paralyzed, and, when his strange appearance had attracted attention, his legs would give way and he would find himself with his back on the pavement, where he waited to be picked up by sympathetic spectators shedding silver and copper. After an indefinite number of performances Meckisch would hurry home in the darkness to dance and sing "Tiddy, riddy, roi, toi, bim, bom."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Thus Meckisch lived at peace with God and man, till one day the fatal thought came into his head that he wanted a second wife. There was no difficulty in getting one--by the aid of his friend, Sugarman the __ soon the little man found his household goods increased by the possession of a fat, Russian giantess. Meckisch did not call in the authorities to marry him. He had a "still wedding," which cost nothing. An artificial canopy made out of a sheet and four broomsticks was erected in the chimney corner and nine male friends sanctified the ceremony by their presence. Meckisch and the Russian giantess fasted on their wedding morn and everything was in honorable order.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But Meckisch's happiness and economies were short-lived. The Russian giantess turned out a tartar. She got her claws into his savings and decorated herself with Paisley shawls and gold necklaces. Nay more! She insisted that Meckisch must give her "Society" and keep open house. Accordingly the bed-sitting room which they rented was turned into a _salon_ of reception, and hither one Friday night came Peleg Shmendrik and his wife and Mr. and Mrs. Sugarman. Over the Sabbath meal the current of talk divided itself into masculine and feminine freshets. The ladies discussed bonnets and the gentlemen Talmud. All the three men dabbled, pettily enough, in stocks and shares, but nothing in the world would tempt them to transact any negotiation or discuss the merits of a prospectus on the Sabbath, though they were all fluttered by the allurements of the Sapphire Mines, Limited, as set forth in a whole page of advertisement in the "_Jewish Chronicle_, the organ naturally perused for its religious news on Friday evenings. The share-list would close at noon on Monday.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But when Moses, our teacher, struck the rock," said Peleg Shmendrik, in the course of the discussion, "he was right the first time but wrong the second, because as the Talmud points out, a child may be chastised when it is little, but as it grows up it should be reasoned with."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes," said Sugarman the _Shadchan_, quickly; "but if his rod had not been made of sapphire he would have split that instead of the rock."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Was it made of sapphire?" asked Meckisch, who was rather a Man-of-the-Earth.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Of course it was--and a very fine thing, too," answered Sugarman.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you think so?" inquired Peleg Shmendrik eagerly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The sapphire is a magic stone," answered Sugarman. "It improves the vision and makes peace between foes. Issachar, the studious son of Jacob, was represented on the Breast-plate by the sapphire. Do you not know that the mist-like centre of the sapphire symbolizes the cloud that enveloped Sinai at the giving of the Law?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I did not know that," answered Peleg Shmendrik, "but I know that Moses's Rod was created in the twilight of the first Sabbath and God did everything after that with this sceptre."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Ah, but we are not all strong enough to wield Moses's Rod; it weighed forty seahs," said Sugarman.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How many seahs do you think one could safely carry?" said Meckisch.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Five or six seahs--not more," said Sugarman. "You see one might drop them if he attempted more and even sapphire may break--the First Tables of the Law were made of sapphire, and yet from a great height they fell terribly, and were shattered to pieces."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Gideon, the M.P., may be said to desire a Rod of Moses, for his secretary told me he will take forty," said Shmendrik.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Hush! what are you saying!" said Sugarman, "Gideon is a rich man, and then he is a director."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It seems a good lot of directors," said Meckisch.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Good to look at. But who can tell?" said Sugarman, shaking his head. "The Queen of Sheba probably brought sapphires to Solomon, but she was not a virtuous woman."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Ah, Solomon!" sighed Mrs. Shmendrik, pricking up her ears and interrupting this talk of stocks and stones, "If he'd had a thousand daughters instead of a thousand wives, even his treasury couldn't have held out. I had only two girls, praised be He, and yet it nearly ruined me to buy them husbands. A dirty _Greener_ comes over, without a shirt to his skin, and nothing else but he must have two hundred pounds in the hand. And then you've got to stick to his back to see that he doesn't take his breeches in his hand and off to America. In Poland he would have been glad to get a maiden, and would have said thank you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, but what about your own son?" said Sugarman; "Why haven't you asked me to find Shosshi a wife? It's a sin against the maidens of Israel. He must be long past the Talmudical age."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He is twenty-four," replied Peleg Shmendrik.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Tu, tu, tu, tu, tu!" said Sugarman, clacking his tongue in horror, "have you perhaps an objection to his marrying?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Save us and grant us peace!" said the father in deprecatory horror. "Only Shosshi is so shy. You are aware, too, he is not handsome. Heaven alone knows whom he takes after."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Peleg, I blush for you," said Mrs. Shmendrik. "What is the matter with the boy? Is he deaf, dumb, blind, unprovided with legs? If Shosshi is backward with the women, it is because he 'learns' so hard when he's not at work. He earns a good living by his cabinet-making and it is quite time he set up a Jewish household for himself. How much will you want for finding him a _Calloh_?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Hush!" said Sugarman sternly, "do you forget it is the Sabbath? Be assured I shall not charge more than last time, unless the bride has an extra good dowry."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 On Saturday night immediately after _Havdalah_, Sugarman went to Mr. Belcovitch, who was just about to resume work, and informed him he had the very _Chosan_ for Becky. "I know," he said, "Becky has a lot of young men after her, but what are they but a pack of bare-backs? How much will you give for a solid man?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 After much haggling Belcovitch consented to give twenty pounds immediately before the marriage ceremony and another twenty at the end of twelve months.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But no pretending you haven't got it about you, when we're at the _Shool_, no asking us to wait till we get home," said Sugarman, "or else I withdraw my man, even from under the _Chuppah_ itself. When shall I bring him for your inspection?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, to-morrow afternoon, Sunday, when Becky will be out in the park with her young men. It's best I shall see him first!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Sugarman now regarded Shosshi as a married man! He rubbed his hands and went to see him. He found him in a little shed in the back yard where he did extra work at home. Shosshi was busy completing little wooden articles--stools and wooden spoons and moneyboxes for sale in Petticoat Lane next day. He supplemented his wages that way.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Good evening, Shosshi," said Sugarman.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Good evening," murmured Shosshi, sawing away.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Shosshi was a gawky young man with a blotched sandy face ever ready to blush deeper with the suspicion that conversations going on at a distance were all about him. His eyes were shifty and catlike; one shoulder overbalanced the other, and when he walked, he swayed loosely to and fro. Sugarman was rarely remiss in the offices of piety and he was nigh murmuring the prayer at the sight of monstrosities. "Blessed art Thou who variest the creatures." But resisting the temptation he said aloud, "I have something to tell you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Shosshi looked up suspiciously.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Don't bother: I am busy," he said, and applied his plane to the leg of a stool.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But this is more important than stools. How would you like to get married?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Shosshi's face became like a peony.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Don't make laughter," he said.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But I mean it. You are twenty-four years old and ought to have a wife and four children by this time."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But I don't want a wife and four children," said Shosshi.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, of course not. I don't mean a widow. It is a maiden I have in my eye."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Nonsense, what maiden would have me?" said Shosshi, a note of eagerness mingling with the diffidence of the words.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What maiden? _Gott in Himmel_! A hundred. A fine, strong, healthy young man like you, who can make a good living!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Shosshi put down his plane and straightened himself. There was a moment of silence. Then his frame collapsed again into a limp mass. His head drooped over his left shoulder. "This is all foolishness you talk, the maidens make mock."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Be not a piece of clay! I know a maiden who has you quite in affection!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The blush which had waned mantled in a full flood. Shosshi stood breathless, gazing half suspiciously, half credulously at his strictly honorable Mephistopheles.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 It was about seven o'clock and the moon was a yellow crescent in the frosty heavens. The sky was punctured with clear-cut constellations. The back yard looked poetic with its blend of shadow and moonlight.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "A beautiful fine maid," said Sugarman ecstatically, "with pink cheeks and black eyes and forty pounds dowry."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The moon sailed smilingly along. The water was running into the cistern with a soothing, peaceful sound. Shosshi consented to go and see Mr. Belcovitch.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Mr. Belcovitch made no parade. Everything was as usual. On the wooden table were two halves of squeezed lemons, a piece of chalk, two cracked cups and some squashed soap. He was not overwhelmed by Shosshi, but admitted he was solid. His father was known to be pious, and both his sisters had married reputable men. Above all, he was not a Dutchman. Shosshi left No. 1 Royal Street, Belcovitch's accepted son-in-law. Esther met him on the stairs and noted the radiance on his pimply countenance. He walked with his head almost erect. Shosshi was indeed very much in love and felt that all that was needed for his happiness was a sight of his future wife.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But he had no time to go and see her except on Sunday afternoons, and then she was always out. Mrs. Belcovitch, however, made amends by paying him considerable attention. The sickly-looking little woman chatted to him for hours at a time about her ailments and invited him to taste her medicine, which was a compliment Mrs. Belcovitch passed only to her most esteemed visitors. By and by she even wore her night-cap in his presence as a sign that he had become one of the family. Under this encouragement Shosshi grew confidential and imparted to his future mother-in-law the details of his mother's disabilities. But he could mention nothing which Mrs. Belcovitch could not cap, for she was a woman extremely catholic in her maladies. She was possessed of considerable imagination, and once when Fanny selected a bonnet for her in a milliner's window, the girl had much difficulty in persuading her it was not inferior to what turned out to be the reflection of itself in a side mirror.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I'm so weak upon my legs," she would boast to Shosshi. "I was born with ill-matched legs. One is a thick one and one is a thin one, and so one goes about."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Shosshi expressed his sympathetic admiration and the courtship proceeded apace. Sometimes Fanny and Pesach Weingott would be at home working, and they were very affable to him. He began to lose something of his shyness and his lurching gait, and he quite looked forward to his weekly visit to the Belcovitches. It was the story of Cymon and Iphigenia over again. Love improved even his powers of conversation, for when Belcovitch held forth at length Shosshi came in several times with "So?" and sometimes in the right place. Mr. Belcovitch loved his own voice and listened to it, the arrested press-iron in his hand. Occasionally in the middle of one of his harangues it would occur to him that some one was talking and wasting time, and then he would say to the room, "Shah! Make an end, make an end," and dry up. But to Shosshi he was especially polite, rarely interrupting himself when his son-in-law elect was hanging on his words. There was an intimate tender tone about these _causeries_.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I should like to drop down dead suddenly," he would say with the air of a philosopher, who had thought it all out. "I shouldn't care to lie up in bed and mess about with medicine and doctors. To make a long job of dying is so expensive."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "So?" said Shosshi.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Don't worry, Bear! I dare say the devil will seize you suddenly," interposed Mrs. Belcovitch drily.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It will not be the devil," said Mr. Belcovitch, confidently and in a confidential manner. "If I had died as a young man, Shosshi, it might have been different."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Shosshi pricked up his ears to listen to the tale of Bear's wild cubhood.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "One morning," said Belcovitch, "in Poland, I got up at four o'clock to go to Supplications for Forgiveness. The air was raw and there was no sign of dawn! Suddenly I noticed a black pig trotting behind me. I quickened my pace and the black pig did likewise. I broke into a run and I heard the pig's paws patting furiously upon the hard frozen ground. A cold sweat broke out all over me. I looked over my shoulder and saw the pig's eyes burning like red-hot coals in the darkness. Then I knew that the Not Good One was after me. 'Hear, O Israel,' I cried. I looked up to the heavens but there was a cold mist covering the stars. Faster and faster I flew and faster and faster flew the demon pig. At last the _Shool_ came in sight. I made one last wild effort and fell exhausted upon the holy threshold and the pig vanished."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "So?" said Shosshi, with a long breath.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Immediately after _Shool_ I spake with the Rabbi and he said 'Bear, are thy _Tephillin_ in order?' So I said 'Yea, Rabbi, they are very large and I bought them of the pious scribe, Naphtali, and I look to the knots weekly.' But he said, 'I will examine them.' So I brought them to him and he opened the head-phylactery and lo! in place of the holy parchment he found bread crumbs."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Hoi, hoi," said Shosshi in horror, his red hands quivering.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes," said Bear mournfully, "I had worn them for ten years and moreover the leaven had denied all my Passovers."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Belcovitch also entertained the lover with details of the internal politics of the "Sons of the Covenant."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Shosshi's affection for Becky increased weekly under the stress of these intimate conversations with her family. At last his passion was rewarded, and Becky, at the violent instance of her father, consented to disappoint one of her young men and stay at home to meet her future husband. She put off her consent till after dinner though, and it began to rain immediately before she gave it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The moment Shosshi came into the room he divined that a change had come over the spirit of the dream. Out of the corners of his eyes he caught a glimpse of an appalling beauty standing behind a sewing machine. His face fired up, his legs began to quiver, he wished the ground would open and swallow him as it did Korah.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Becky," said Mr. Belcovitch, "this is Mr. Shosshi Shmendrik."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Shosshi put on a sickly grin and nodded his head affirmatively, as if to corroborate the statement, and the round felt hat he wore slid back till the broad rim rested on his ears. Through a sort of mist a terribly fine maid loomed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Becky stared at him haughtily and curled her lip. Then she giggled.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Shosshi held out his huge red hand limply. Becky took no notice of it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "_Nu_, Becky!" breathed Belcovitch, in a whisper that could have been heard across the way.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How are you? All right?" said Becky, very loud, as if she thought deafness was among Shosshi's disadvantages.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Shosshi grinned reassuringly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 There was another silence.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Shosshi wondered whether the _convenances_ would permit him to take his leave now. He did not feel comfortable at all. Everything had been going so delightfully, it had been quite a pleasure to him to come to the house. But now all was changed. The course of true love never does run smooth, and the advent of this new personage into the courtship was distinctly embarrassing.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The father came to the rescue.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "A little rum?" he said.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes," said Shosshi.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Chayah! _nu_. Fetch the bottle!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Mrs. Belcovitch went to the chest of drawers in the corner of the room and took from the top of it a large decanter. She then produced two glasses without feet and filled them with the home-made rum, handing one to Shosshi and the other to her husband. Shosshi muttered a blessing over it, then he leered vacuously at the company and cried, "To life!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "To peace!" replied the older man, gulping down the spirit. Shosshi was doing the same, when his eye caught Becky's. He choked for five minutes, Mrs. Belcovitch thumping him maternally on the back. When he was comparatively recovered the sense of his disgrace rushed upon him and overwhelmed him afresh. Becky was still giggling behind the sewing machine. Once more Shosshi felt that the burden of the conversation was upon him. He looked at his boots and not seeing anything there, looked up again and grinned encouragingly at the company as if to waive his rights. But finding the company did not respond, he blew his nose enthusiastically as a lead off to the conversation.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Mr. Belcovitch saw his embarrassment, and, making a sign to Chayah, slipped out of the room followed by his wife. Shosshi was left alone with the terribly fine maid.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Becky stood still, humming a little air and looking up at the ceiling, as if she had forgotten Shosshi's existence. With her eyes in that position it was easier for Shosshi to look at her. He stole side-long glances at her, which, growing bolder and bolder, at length fused into an uninterrupted steady gaze. How fine and beautiful she was! His eyes began to glitter, a smile of approbation overspread his face. Suddenly she looked down and their eyes met. Shosshi's smile hurried off and gave way to a sickly sheepish look and his legs felt weak. The terribly fine maid gave a kind of snort and resumed her inspection of the ceiling. Gradually Shosshi found himself examining her again. Verily Sugarman had spoken truly of her charms. But--overwhelming thought--had not Sugarman also said she loved him? Shosshi knew nothing of the ways of girls, except what he had learned from the Talmud. Quite possibly Becky was now occupied in expressing ardent affection. He shuffled towards her, his heart beating violently. He was near enough to touch her. The air she was humming throbbed in his ears. He opened his mouth to speak--Becky becoming suddenly aware of his proximity fixed him with a basilisk glare--the words were frozen on his lips. For some seconds his mouth remained open, then the ridiculousness of shutting it again without speaking spurred him on to make some sound, however meaningless. He made a violent effort and there burst from his lips in Hebrew:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Happy are those who dwell in thy house, ever shall they praise thee, Selah!" It was not a compliment to Becky. Shosshi's face lit up with joyous relief. By some inspiration he had started the afternoon prayer. He felt that Becky would understand the pious necessity. With fervent gratitude to the Almighty he continued the Psalm: "Happy are the people whose lot is thus, etc." Then he turned his back on Becky, with his face to the East wall, made three steps forwards and commenced the silent delivery of the _Amidah_. Usually he gabbled off the "Eighteen Blessings" in five minutes. To-day they were prolonged till he heard the footsteps of the returning parents. Then he scurried through the relics of the service at lightning speed. When Mr. and Mrs. Belcovitch re-entered the room they saw by his happy face that all was well and made no opposition to his instant departure.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He came again the next Sunday and was rejoiced to find that Becky was out, though he had hoped to find her in. The courtship made great strides that afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Belcovitch being more amiable than ever to compensate for Becky's private refusal to entertain the addresses of such a _Schmuck_. There had been sharp domestic discussions during the week, and Becky had only sniffed at her parents' commendations of Shosshi as a "very worthy youth." She declared that it was "remission of sins merely to look at him."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Next Sabbath Mr. and Mrs. Belcovitch paid a formal visit to Shosshi's parents to make their acquaintance, and partook of tea and cake. Becky was not with them; moreover she defiantly declared she would never be at home on a Sunday till Shosshi was married. They circumvented her by getting him up on a weekday. The image of Becky had been so often in his thoughts now that by the time he saw her the second time he was quite habituated to her appearance. He had even imagined his arm round her waist, but in practice he found he could go no further as yet than ordinary conversation.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Becky was sitting sewing buttonholes when Shosshi arrived. Everybody was there--Mr. Belcovitch pressing coats with hot irons; Fanny shaking the room with her heavy machine; Pesach Weingott cutting a piece of chalk-marked cloth; Mrs. Belcovitch carefully pouring out tablespoonfuls of medicine. There were even some outside "hands," work being unusually plentiful, as from the manifestos of Simon Wolf, the labor-leader, the slop manufacturers anticipated a strike.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Sustained by their presence, Shosshi felt a bold and gallant wooer. He determined that this time he would not go without having addressed at least one remark to the object of his affections. Grinning amiably at the company generally, by way of salutation, he made straight for Becky's corner. The terribly fine lady snorted at the sight of him, divining that she had been out-manoeuvred. Belcovitch surveyed the situation out of the corners of his eyes, not pausing a moment in his task.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "_Nu_, how goes it, Becky?" Shosshi murmured.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Becky said, "All right, how are you?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "God be thanked, I have nothing to complain of," said Shosshi, encouraged by the warmth of his welcome. "My eyes are rather weak, still, though much better than last year."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Becky made no reply, so Shosshi continued: "But my mother is always a sick person. She has to swallow bucketsful of cod liver oil. She cannot be long for this world."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Nonsense, nonsense," put in Mrs. Belcovitch, appearing suddenly behind the lovers. "My children's children shall never be any worse; it's all fancy with her, she coddles herself too much."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, no, she says she's much worse than you," Shosshi blurted out, turning round to face his future mother-in-law.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, indeed!" said Chayah angrily. "My enemies shall have my maladies! If your mother had my health, she would be lying in bed with it. But I go about in a sick condition. I can hardly crawl around. Look at my legs--has your mother got such legs? One a thick one and one a thin one."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Shosshi grew scarlet; he felt he had blundered. It was the first real shadow on his courtship--perhaps the little rift within the lute. He turned back to Becky for sympathy. There was no Becky. She had taken advantage of the conversation to slip away. He found her again in a moment though, at the other end of the room. She was seated before a machine. He crossed the room boldly and bent over her.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Don't you feel cold, working?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 _Br-r-r-r-r-r-h_!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 It was the machine turning. Becky had set the treadle going madly and was pushing a piece of cloth under the needle. When she paused, Shosshi said:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Have you heard Reb Shemuel preach? He told a very amusing allegory last--"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 _Br-r-r-r-r-r-r-h_!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Undaunted, Shosshi recounted the amusing allegory at length, and as the noise of her machine prevented Becky hearing a word she found his conversation endurable. After several more monologues, accompanied on the machine by Becky, Shosshi took his departure in high feather, promising to bring up specimens of his handiwork for her edification.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 On his next visit he arrived with his arms laden with choice morsels of carpentry. He laid them on the table for her admiration.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They were odd knobs and rockers for Polish cradles! The pink of Becky's cheeks spread all over her face like a blot of red ink on a piece of porous paper. Shosshi's face reflected the color in even more ensanguined dyes. Becky rushed from the room and Shosshi heard her giggling madly on the staircase. It dawned upon him that he had displayed bad taste in his selection.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What have you done to my child?" Mrs. Belcovitch inquired.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "N-n-othing," he stammered; "I only brought her some of my work to see."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And is this what one shows to a young girl?" demanded the mother indignantly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "They are only bits of cradles," said Shosshi deprecatingly. "I thought she would like to see what nice workmanly things I turned out. See how smoothly these rockers are carved! There is a thick one, and there is a thin one!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Ah! Shameless droll! dost thou make mock of my legs, too?" said Mrs. Belcovitch. "Out, impudent face, out with thee!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Shosshi gathered up his specimens in his arms and fled through the door. Becky was still in hilarious eruption outside. The sight of her made confusion worse confounded. The knobs and rockers rolled thunderously down the stairs; Shosshi stumbled after them, picking them up on his course and wishing himself dead.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 All Sugarman's strenuous efforts to patch up the affair failed. Shosshi went about broken-hearted for several days. To have been so near the goal--and then not to arrive after all! What made failure more bitter was that he had boasted of his conquest to his acquaintances, especially to the two who kept the stalls to the right and left of him on Sundays in Petticoat Lane. They made a butt of him as it was; he felt he could never stand between them for a whole morning now, and have Attic salt put upon his wounds. He shifted his position, arranging to pay sixpence a time for the privilege of fixing himself outside Widow Finkelstein's shop, which stood at the corner of a street, and might be presumed to intercept two streams of pedestrians. Widow Finkelstein's shop was a chandler's, and she did a large business in farthing-worths of boiling water. There was thus no possible rivalry between her ware and Shosshi's, which consisted of wooden candlesticks, little rocking chairs, stools, ash-trays, etc., piled up artistically on a barrow.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But Shosshi's luck had gone with the change of _locus_. His _clientele_ went to the old spot but did not find him. He did not even make a hansel. At two o'clock he tied his articles to the barrow with a complicated arrangement of cords. Widow Finkelstein waddled out and demanded her sixpence. Shosshi replied that he had not taken sixpence, that the coign was not one of vantage. Widow Finkelstein stood up for her rights, and even hung on to the barrow for them. There was a short, sharp argument, a simultaneous jabbering, as of a pair of monkeys. Shosshi Shmendrik's pimply face worked with excited expostulation, Widow Finkelstein's cushion-like countenance was agitated by waves of righteous indignation. Suddenly Shosshi darted between the shafts and made a dash off with the barrow down the side street. But Widow Finkelstein pressed it down with all her force, arresting the motion like a drag. Incensed by the laughter of the spectators, Shosshi put forth all his strength at the shafts, jerked the widow off her feet and see-sawed her sky-wards, huddled up spherically like a balloon, but clinging as grimly as ever to the defalcating barrow. Then Shosshi started off at a run, the carpentry rattling, and the dead weight of his living burden making his muscles ache.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Right to the end of the street he dragged her, pursued by a hooting crowd. Then he stopped, worn out.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Will you give me that sixpence, you _Ganef_!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, I haven't got it. You'd better go back to your shop, else you'll suffer from worse thieves."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 It was true. Widow Finkelstein smote her wig in horror and hurried back to purvey treacle.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But that night when she shut up the shutters, she hurried off to Shosshi's address, which she had learned in the interim. His little brother opened the door and said Shosshi was in the shed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He was just nailing the thicker of those rockers on to the body of a cradle. His soul was full of bitter-sweet memories. Widow Finkelstein suddenly appeared in the moonlight. For a moment Shosshi's heart beat wildly. He thought the buxom figure was Becky's.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have come for my sixpence."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Ah! The words awoke him from his dream. It was only the Widow Finkelstein.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And yet--! Verily, the widow, too, was plump and agreeable; if only her errand had been pleasant, Shosshi felt she might have brightened his back yard. He had been moved to his depths latterly and a new tenderness and a new boldness towards women shone in his eyes.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He rose and put his head on one side and smiled amiably and said, "Be not so foolish. I did not take a copper. I am a poor young man. You have plenty of money in your stocking."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How know you that?" said the widow, stretching forward her right foot meditatively and gazing at the strip of stocking revealed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Never mind!" said Shosshi, shaking his head sapiently.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, it's true," she admitted. "I have two hundred and seventeen golden sovereigns besides my shop. But for all that why should you keep my sixpence?" She asked it with the same good-humored smile.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The logic of that smile was unanswerable. Shosshi's mouth opened, but no sound issued from it. He did not even say the Evening Prayer. The moon sailed slowly across the heavens. The water flowed into the cistern with a soft soothing sound.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Suddenly it occurred to Shosshi that the widow's waist was not very unlike that which he had engirdled imaginatively. He thought he would just try if the sensation was anything like what he had fancied. His arm strayed timidly round her black-beaded mantle. The sense of his audacity was delicious. He was wondering whether he ought to say _She-hechyoni_--the prayer over a new pleasure. But the Widow Finkelstein stopped his mouth with a kiss. After that Shosshi forgot his pious instincts.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Except old Mrs. Ansell, Sugarman was the only person scandalized. Shosshi's irrepressible spirit of romance had robbed him of his commission. But Meckisch danced with Shosshi Shmendrik at the wedding, while the _Calloh_ footed it with the Russian giantess. The men danced in one-half of the room, the women in the other.
