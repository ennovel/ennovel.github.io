THE THREE METAMORPHOSES.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      Three metamorphoses of the spirit do I designate to you: how the spirit becometh a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child.
<br> 
<br> Many heavy things are there for the spirit, the strong load-bearing spirit in which reverence dwelleth: for the heavy and the heaviest longeth its strength.
<br> 
<br> What is heavy? so asketh the load-bearing spirit; then kneeleth it down like the camel, and wanteth to be well laden.
<br> 
<br> What is the heaviest thing, ye heroes? asketh the load-bearing spirit, that I may take it upon me and rejoice in my strength.
<br> 
<br> Is it not this: To humiliate oneself in order to mortify one’s pride? To exhibit one’s folly in order to mock at one’s wisdom?
<br> 
<br> Or is it this: To desert our cause when it celebrateth its triumph? To ascend high mountains to tempt the tempter?
<br> 
<br> Or is it this: To feed on the acorns and grass of knowledge, and for the sake of truth to suffer hunger of soul?
<br> 
<br> Or is it this: To be sick and dismiss comforters, and make friends of the deaf, who never hear thy requests?
<br> 
<br> Or is it this: To go into foul water when it is the water of truth, and not disclaim cold frogs and hot toads?
<br> 
<br> Or is it this: To love those who despise us, and give one’s hand to the phantom when it is going to frighten us?
<br> 
<br> All these heaviest things the load-bearing spirit taketh upon itself: and like the camel, which, when laden, hasteneth into the wilderness, so hasteneth the spirit into its wilderness.
<br> 
<br> But in the loneliest wilderness happeneth the second metamorphosis: here the spirit becometh a lion; freedom will it capture, and lordship in its own wilderness.
<br> 
<br> Its last Lord it here seeketh: hostile will it be to him, and to its last God; for victory will it struggle with the great dragon.
<br> 
<br> What is the great dragon which the spirit is no longer inclined to call Lord and God? “Thou-shalt,” is the great dragon called. But the spirit of the lion saith, “I will.”
<br> 
<br> “Thou-shalt,” lieth in its path, sparkling with gold—a scale-covered beast; and on every scale glittereth golden, “Thou shalt!”
<br> 
<br> The values of a thousand years glitter on those scales, and thus speaketh the mightiest of all dragons: “All the values of things—glitter on me.
<br> 
<br> All values have already been created, and all created values—do I represent. Verily, there shall be no ‘I will’ any more. Thus speaketh the dragon.
<br> 
<br> My brethren, wherefore is there need of the lion in the spirit? Why sufficeth not the beast of burden, which renounceth and is reverent?
<br> 
<br> To create new values—that, even the lion cannot yet accomplish: but to create itself freedom for new creating—that can the might of the lion do.
<br> 
<br> To create itself freedom, and give a holy Nay even unto duty: for that, my brethren, there is need of the lion.
<br> 
<br> To assume the right to new values—that is the most formidable assumption for a load-bearing and reverent spirit. Verily, unto such a spirit it is preying, and the work of a beast of prey.
<br> 
<br> As its holiest, it once loved “Thou-shalt”: now is it forced to find illusion and arbitrariness even in the holiest things, that it may capture freedom from its love: the lion is needed for this capture.
<br> 
<br> But tell me, my brethren, what the child can do, which even the lion could not do? Why hath the preying lion still to become a child?
<br> 
<br> Innocence is the child, and forgetfulness, a new beginning, a game, a self-rolling wheel, a first movement, a holy Yea.
<br> 
<br> Aye, for the game of creating, my brethren, there is needed a holy Yea unto life: ITS OWN will, willeth now the spirit; HIS OWN world winneth the world’s outcast.
<br> 
<br> Three metamorphoses of the spirit have I designated to you: how the spirit became a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child.—
<br> 
<br> Thus spake Zarathustra. And at that time he abode in the town which is called The Pied Cow.
