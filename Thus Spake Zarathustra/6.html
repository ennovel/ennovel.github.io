THE DESPISERS OF THE BODY.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      To the despisers of the body will I speak my word. I wish them neither to learn afresh, nor teach anew, but only to bid farewell to their own bodies,—and thus be dumb.
<br> 
<br> “Body am I, and soul”—so saith the child. And why should one not speak like children?
<br> 
<br> But the awakened one, the knowing one, saith: “Body am I entirely, and nothing more; and soul is only the name of something in the body.”
<br> 
<br> The body is a big sagacity, a plurality with one sense, a war and a peace, a flock and a shepherd.
<br> 
<br> An instrument of thy body is also thy little sagacity, my brother, which thou callest “spirit”—a little instrument and plaything of thy big sagacity.
<br> 
<br> “Ego,” sayest thou, and art proud of that word. But the greater thing—in which thou art unwilling to believe—is thy body with its big sagacity; it saith not “ego,” but doeth it.
<br> 
<br> What the sense feeleth, what the spirit discerneth, hath never its end in itself. But sense and spirit would fain persuade thee that they are the end of all things: so vain are they.
<br> 
<br> Instruments and playthings are sense and spirit: behind them there is still the Self. The Self seeketh with the eyes of the senses, it hearkeneth also with the ears of the spirit.
<br> 
<br> Ever hearkeneth the Self, and seeketh; it compareth, mastereth, conquereth, and destroyeth. It ruleth, and is also the ego’s ruler.
<br> 
<br> Behind thy thoughts and feelings, my brother, there is a mighty lord, an unknown sage—it is called Self; it dwelleth in thy body, it is thy body.
<br> 
<br> There is more sagacity in thy body than in thy best wisdom. And who then knoweth why thy body requireth just thy best wisdom?
<br> 
<br> Thy Self laugheth at thine ego, and its proud prancings. “What are these prancings and flights of thought unto me?” it saith to itself. “A by-way to my purpose. I am the leading-string of the ego, and the prompter of its notions.”
<br> 
<br> The Self saith unto the ego: “Feel pain!” And thereupon it suffereth, and thinketh how it may put an end thereto—and for that very purpose it IS MEANT to think.
<br> 
<br> The Self saith unto the ego: “Feel pleasure!” Thereupon it rejoiceth, and thinketh how it may ofttimes rejoice—and for that very purpose it IS MEANT to think.
<br> 
<br> To the despisers of the body will I speak a word. That they despise is caused by their esteem. What is it that created esteeming and despising and worth and will?
<br> 
<br> The creating Self created for itself esteeming and despising, it created for itself joy and woe. The creating body created for itself spirit, as a hand to its will.
<br> 
<br> Even in your folly and despising ye each serve your Self, ye despisers of the body. I tell you, your very Self wanteth to die, and turneth away from life.
<br> 
<br> No longer can your Self do that which it desireth most:—create beyond itself. That is what it desireth most; that is all its fervour.
<br> 
<br> But it is now too late to do so:—so your Self wisheth to succumb, ye despisers of the body.
<br> 
<br> To succumb—so wisheth your Self; and therefore have ye become despisers of the body. For ye can no longer create beyond yourselves.
<br> 
<br> And therefore are ye now angry with life and with the earth. And unconscious envy is in the sidelong look of your contempt.
<br> 
<br> I go not your way, ye despisers of the body! Ye are no bridges for me to the Superman!—
<br> 
<br> Thus spake Zarathustra.
