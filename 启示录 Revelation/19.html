<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;After these things there came to my ears a sound like the voice of a great band of people in heaven, saying, Praise to the Lord; salvation and glory and power be to our God:
<br>19:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 的 判 断 是 真 实 公 义 的 。 因 他 判 断 了 那 用 淫 行 败 坏 世 界 的 大 淫 妇 ， 并 且 向 淫 妇 讨 流 仆 人 血 的 罪 ， 给 他 们 伸 冤 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For true and upright are his decisions; for by him has the evil woman been judged, who made the earth unclean with the sins of her body; and he has given her punishment for the blood of his servants.
<br>19:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 说 ， 哈 利 路 亚 。 烧 淫 妇 的 烟 往 上 冒 ， 直 到 永 永 远 远 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And again they said, Praise to the Lord. And her smoke went up for ever and ever.
<br>19:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 二 十 四 位 长 老 与 四 活 物 ， 就 俯 伏 敬 拜 坐 宝 座 的 神 ， 说 ， 阿 们 ， 哈 利 路 亚 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the four and twenty rulers and the four beasts went down on their faces and gave worship to God who was seated on the high seat, saying, Even so, praise to the Lord.
<br>19:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 声 音 从 宝 座 出 来 说 ， 神 的 众 仆 人 哪 ， 凡 敬 畏 他 的 ， 无 论 大 小 ， 都 要 赞 美 我 们 的 神 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And a voice came from the high seat, saying, Give praise to our God, all you his servants, small and great, in whom is the fear of him.
<br>19:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 听 见 好 像 群 众 的 声 音 ， 众 水 的 声 音 ， 大 雷 的 声 音 ， 说 ， 哈 利 路 亚 。 因 为 主 我 们 的 神 ， 全 能 者 ， 作 王 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And there came to my ears the voice of a great army, like the sound of waters, and the sound of loud thunders, saying, Praise to the Lord: for the Lord our God, Ruler of all, is King.
<br>19:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 们 要 欢 喜 快 乐 ， 将 荣 耀 归 给 他 。 因 为 羔 羊 婚 娶 的 时 候 到 了 ， 新 妇 也 自 己 预 备 好 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Let us be glad with delight, and let us give glory to him: because the time is come for the Lamb to be married, and his wife has made herself ready.
<br>19:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 蒙 恩 得 穿 光 明 洁 白 的 细 麻 衣 ， 这 细 麻 衣 就 是 圣 徒 所 行 的 义 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And to her it was given to be clothed in delicate linen, clean and shining: for the clean linen is the righteousness of the saints.
<br>19:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;天 使 吩 咐 我 说 ， 你 要 写 上 ， 凡 被 请 赴 羔 羊 之 婚 筵 的 有 福 了 。 又 对 我 说 ， 这 是 神 真 实 的 话 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to me, Put in the book, Happy are the guests at the bride-feast of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true words of God.
<br>19:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 就 俯 伏 在 他 脚 前 要 拜 他 。 他 说 ， 千 万 不 可 。 我 和 你 并 你 那 些 为 耶 稣 作 见 证 的 弟 兄 同 是 作 仆 人 的 。 你 要 敬 拜 神 。 因 为 预 言 中 的 灵 意 ， 乃 是 为 耶 稣 作 见 证 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And I went on my face before his feet to give him worship. And he said to me, See you do it not: I am a brother-servant with you and with your brothers who keep the witness of Jesus: give worship to God: for the witness of Jesus is the spirit of the prophet's word.
<br>19:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 观 看 ， 见 天 开 了 。 有 一 匹 白 马 。 骑 在 马 上 的 ， 称 为 诚 信 真 实 。 他 审 判 争 战 都 按 着 公 义 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the heaven was open; and I saw a white horse, and he who was seated on it was named Certain and True; and he is judging and making war in righteousness.
<br>19:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 的 眼 睛 如 火 焰 ， 他 头 上 戴 着 许 多 冠 冕 。 又 有 写 着 的 名 字 ， 除 了 他 自 己 没 有 人 知 道 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And his eyes are a flame of fire, and crowns are on his head; and he has a name in writing, of which no man has knowledge but himself.
<br>19:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 穿 着 溅 了 血 的 衣 服 。 他 的 名 称 为 神 之 道 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he is clothed in a robe washed with blood: and his name is The Word of God.
<br>19:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 天 上 的 众 军 ， 骑 着 白 马 ， 穿 着 细 麻 衣 ， 又 白 又 洁 ， 跟 随 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the armies which are in heaven went after him on white horses, clothed in delicate linen, white and clean.
<br>19:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 利 剑 从 他 口 中 出 来 ， 可 以 击 杀 列 国 。 他 必 用 铁 杖 辖 管 他 们 。 （ 辖 管 原 文 作 牧 ） 并 要 踹 全 能 神 烈 怒 的 酒 榨 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And out of his mouth comes a sharp sword, with which he overcomes the nations: and he has rule over them with a rod of iron: and he is crushing with his feet the grapes of the strong wrath of God the Ruler of all.
<br>19:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 他 衣 服 和 大 腿 上 ， 有 名 写 着 说 ， 万 王 之 王 ， 万 主 之 主 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And on his robe and on his leg is a name, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.
<br>19:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 又 看 见 一 位 天 使 站 在 日 头 中 ， 向 天 空 所 飞 的 鸟 ， 大 声 喊 着 说 ， 你 们 聚 集 来 赴 神 的 大 筵 席 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And I saw an angel taking his place in the sun; and he was crying with a loud voice, saying to all the birds in flight in the heavens, Come together to the great feast of God;
<br>19:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;可 以 吃 君 王 与 将 军 的 肉 ， 壮 士 与 马 和 骑 马 者 的 肉 ， 并 一 切 自 主 的 为 奴 的 ， 以 及 大 小 人 民 的 肉 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So that you may take for your food the flesh of kings, and of captains, and of strong men, and of horses and of those who are seated on them, and the flesh of all men, free and unfree, small and great.
<br>19:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 看 见 那 兽 ， 和 地 上 的 君 王 ， 并 他 们 的 众 军 ， 都 聚 集 ， 要 与 骑 白 马 的 并 他 的 军 兵 争 战 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, come together to make war against him who was seated on the horse and against his army.
<br>19:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 兽 被 擒 拿 ， 那 在 兽 面 前 曾 行 奇 事 ， 迷 惑 受 兽 印 记 ， 和 拜 兽 像 之 人 的 假 先 知 ， 也 与 兽 同 被 擒 拿 。 他 们 两 个 就 活 活 地 被 扔 在 烧 着 硫 磺 的 火 湖 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who did the signs before him, by which they were turned from the true way who had the mark of the beast, and who gave worship to his image: these two were put living into the sea of ever-burning fire.
<br>19:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;其 余 的 被 骑 白 马 者 口 中 出 来 的 剑 杀 了 。 飞 鸟 都 吃 饱 了 他 们 的 肉 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the rest were put to death with the sword of him who was on the horse, even the sword which came out of his mouth: and all the birds were made full with their flesh.
