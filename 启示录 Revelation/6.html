<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And I saw when the Lamb undid one of the stamps, and the voice of one of the four beasts came to my ears, saying as with a voice of thunder, Come and see.
<br>6:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 就 观 看 ， 见 有 一 匹 白 马 ， 骑 在 马 上 的 拿 着 弓 。 并 有 冠 冕 赐 给 他 。 他 便 出 来 ， 胜 了 又 要 胜 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And I saw a white horse, and he who was seated on it had a bow; and there was given to him a crown: and he went out with power to overcome.
<br>6:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;揭 开 第 二 印 的 时 候 ， 我 听 见 第 二 个 活 物 说 ， 你 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the second stamp was undone, the voice of the second beast came to my ears, saying, Come and see.
<br>6:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 另 有 一 匹 马 出 来 ， 是 红 的 。 有 权 柄 给 了 那 骑 马 的 ， 可 以 从 地 上 夺 去 太 平 ， 使 人 彼 此 相 杀 。 又 有 一 把 大 刀 赐 给 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And another horse came out, a red horse; and it was given to him who was seated on it to take peace from the earth, so that people might put one another to death: and there was given to him a great sword.
<br>6:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;揭 开 第 三 印 的 时 候 ， 我 听 见 第 三 个 活 物 说 ， 你 来 。 我 就 观 看 ， 见 有 一 匹 黑 马 。 骑 在 马 上 的 手 里 拿 着 天 平 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the third stamp was undone, the voice of the third beast came to my ears, saying, Come and see. And I saw a black horse; and he who was seated on it had scales in his hand.
<br>6:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 听 见 在 四 活 物 中 ， 似 乎 有 声 音 说 ， 一 钱 银 子 买 一 升 麦 子 ， 一 钱 银 子 买 三 升 大 麦 。 油 和 酒 不 可 糟 蹋 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And a voice came to my ears, from the middle of the four beasts, saying, A measure of grain for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny: and see that you do no damage to the oil and the wine.
<br>6:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;揭 开 第 四 印 的 时 候 ， 我 听 见 第 四 个 活 物 说 ， 你 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the fourth stamp was undone, the voice of the fourth beast came to my ears, saying, Come and see.
<br>6:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 就 观 看 ， 见 有 一 匹 灰 色 马 。 骑 在 马 上 的 ， 名 字 叫 作 死 。 阴 府 也 随 着 他 。 有 权 柄 赐 给 他 们 ， 可 以 用 刀 剑 ， 饥 荒 ， 瘟 疫 （ 瘟 疫 或 作 死 亡 ） ， 野 兽 ， 杀 害 地 上 四 分 之 一 的 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And I saw a grey horse, and the name of him who was seated on it was Death; and Hell came after him. And there was given to them authority over the fourth part of the earth, to put to destruction by the sword, and by taking away their food, and by death, and by the beasts of the earth.
<br>6:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;揭 开 第 五 印 的 时 候 ， 我 看 见 在 祭 坛 底 下 ， 有 为 神 的 道 ， 并 为 作 见 证 ， 被 杀 之 人 的 灵 魂 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the fifth stamp was undone, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been put to death for the word of God, and for the witness which they kept.
<br>6:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;大 声 喊 着 说 ， 圣 洁 真 实 的 主 阿 ， 你 不 审 判 住 在 地 上 的 人 给 我 们 伸 流 血 的 冤 ， 要 等 到 几 时 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they gave a great cry, saying, How long will it be, O Ruler, holy and true, before you take your place as judge and give punishment for our blood to those on the earth?
<br>6:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 有 白 衣 赐 给 他 们 各 人 。 又 有 话 对 他 们 说 ， 还 要 安 息 片 时 ， 等 着 一 同 作 仆 人 的 ， 和 他 们 的 弟 兄 ， 也 像 他 们 被 杀 ， 满 足 了 数 目 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And there was given to every one a white robe, and they were ordered to take their rest for a little time, till the number was complete of the other servants, their brothers, who would be put to death, even as they had been.
<br>6:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;揭 开 第 六 印 的 时 候 ， 我 又 看 见 地 大 震 动 。 日 头 变 黑 像 毛 布 ， 满 月 变 红 像 血 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And I saw when the sixth stamp was undone, and there was a great earth-shock; and the sun became black as haircloth, and all the moon became as blood;
<br>6:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;天 上 的 星 辰 坠 落 于 地 ， 如 同 无 花 果 树 被 大 风 摇 动 ， 落 下 未 熟 的 果 子 一 样 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the stars of heaven were falling to the earth, like green fruit from a tree before the force of a great wind.
<br>6:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;天 就 挪 移 ， 好 像 书 卷 被 卷 起 来 。 山 岭 海 岛 都 被 挪 移 离 开 本 位 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the heaven was taken away like the roll of a book when it is rolled up; and all the mountains and islands were moved out of their places.
<br>6:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;地 上 的 君 王 ， 臣 宰 ， 将 军 ， 富 户 ， 壮 士 ， 和 一 切 为 奴 的 ， 自 主 的 ， 都 藏 在 山 洞 ， 和 岩 石 穴 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the kings of the earth, and the rulers, and the chief captains, and the men of wealth, and the strong, and every servant and free man, took cover in the holes and the rocks of the mountains;
<br>6:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;向 山 和 岩 石 说 ， 倒 在 我 们 身 上 吧 ， 把 我 们 藏 起 来 ， 躲 避 坐 宝 座 者 的 面 目 ， 和 羔 羊 的 忿 怒 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Come down on us, covering us from the face of him who is seated on the high seat, and from the wrath of the Lamb:
<br>6:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 他 们 忿 怒 的 大 日 到 了 ， 谁 能 站 得 住 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For the great day of their wrath is come, and who may keep his place?
