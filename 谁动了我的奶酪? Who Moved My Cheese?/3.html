They wanted to hear more about what was happening in eachother's lives. After a good deal of kidding, and a good mean, they settled into an interesting conversation.</p> 
<p>　　Angela, who had been one of the most popular people in the class, said, "Life sure turned outdifferently than I thought it would when we were in school. A lot has changed.""It certainly has," Nathan echoed. They knew he had gone into his family's business, which hadoperated pretty much the same and had been a part of the local community for as long as they couldremember. So, they were surprised when he seemed concerned. He asked, "But, have younoticed how we don't want to change when things change?"Carlos said, "I guess we resist changing because we're afraid of change.""Carlos, you were Captain of the football team," Jessica said. "I never thought I'd hear you sayanything about being afraid!"They all laughed as they realized that although they had gone off in different directions - fromworking at home to managing companies - they were experiencing similar feelings.</p> 
<p>　　Everyone was trying to cope with the unexpected changes that were happening to them in recentyears. And more admitted that they did not know a good way to handle them.</p> 
<p>　　Then Michael said, "I used to be afraid of change. When a big change came along in business, wedidn't know what to do. So we didn't do anything differently and we almost lost it.</p> 
<p>　　"That is," he continued, "until I heard a funny little story that changed everything.""How so?" Nathan asked.</p> 
<p>　　"Well, the story altered the way I looked at change, and after that, things quickly improved for me -at work and in my life.</p> 
<p>　　"Then, I passed the story on to some people in our company and they passed it on to others, andsoon our business did much better. And like me, many people said it helped them in their personallives.""What's the story?" Angela asked.</p> 
<p>　　 "It's called, 'Who Moved My Cheese?'"The group laughed. "I think I like it already," Carlos said. "Would you tell us the story?""Sure," Michael replied. "I'd be happy to - it doesn't take long." And so he began the story.</p>
