Instead, he zipped up his new black APC storm jacket, retied his Camper bowling shoes, and headed across town to the Plaza Hotel to meet his agent. The ornate gold-painted Plaza dining room was buzzing with the usual throng of gaudily dressed Russian tourists, extravagant grandmothers, and a few loud families from Texas, all toting shopping bags from FAO Schwarz and Tiffany, and all taking high tea. Except for Rusty Klein.&nbsp; Mwa! Mwa! Rusty blew kisses into the air on either side of Dan's face as he sat down. ?Is Mystery coming?? he asked hopefully. Dozens of gold bracelets clanked noisily as Rusty clapped herself on the forehead. ?Fuck me! I guess I forgot to mention it. Mystery's on a six-month world book tour. We've already sold five hundred thousand copies in Japan!? The last time Dan had seen Mystery had been at an open mike at the Rivington Rover Poetry Club downtown. They'd practically had sex on stage as they performed improv poetry together. Then the wan, horny, yellow-toothed poetess had retreated to write, and Dan hadn't seen her since. ?But her book's not even out yet,? he protested. Rusty piled her fire-engine-red hair on top of her head and stuck a sharpened number two pencil through it. She picked up her martini and guzzled it, smearing hot pink lipstick all over the rim of the glass. ?It doesn't matter if the booknever comes out. Mystery's already a celebrity,? she declared. An avid chain-smoker, Dan was suddenly desperate for a cigarette. But smoking was prohibited, so instead he grabbed a fork from off the table and pressed the tines into the palm of his shaking hand. Mystery, who was only nineteen or twenty (Dan wasn't quite sure), had managed to write a memoir calledWhy I'm So Easy in less than a week. The day she'd finished it, Rusty had sold it to Random House for an astounding six-figure advance, with a film deal attached. Rusty scooted her chair forward and pushed her half-drunk glass of stale tap water toward Dan, as if she expected him to drink it. ?I sent ?Ashes, Ashes? out to theNorth Dakota Review,? she told him offhandedly. ?They hated it.? ?Ashes, Ashes? was Dan's latest poem, written in the voice of a guy who misses his dead dog, only it was left up to the reader to figure out that the narrator was addressing a dog and not his old girlfriend or something. It's the first baseball game of the season I wait for your kiss Breath meaty like chocolate My shoes are still there One in your bed where you left it The other in the backseat of my car Dan slumped in his chair. The week his poem ?Sluts? had come out inThe New Yorker , he'd felt invincible and famous. Now he felt like a schmo. ?Sweetness, I can think of several reasons why your writing may not appeal to everyone the way Mystery's does,? Rusty crooned. ?You're young yet, sugarplum. All you need is some good training. Fuck me, I need another drink.? She belched into her fist and then stuck both hands above her head. Within seconds, a sploshingly full martini was set down before her. Dan picked up the half-empty glass of water and then set it down again. He wanted to ask her about those ?several reasons? why his writing didn't appeal to everyone the way Mystery's did, but then again, he was pretty sure he knew. While Mystery mostly wrote about sex, Dan mostly wrote about death, or wanting to die, or wondering if being dead was better than being alive, which was kind of depressing if you thought about it. Also, he wasn't an orphan like Mystery was?according to legend, anyway. An orphan raised by prostitutes. Dan was just a seventeen-year-old kid who lived in a sprawling prewar apartment on the Upper West Side with his outrageous but loving divorced dad, Rufus, and relatively loving, big-boobed little sister, Jenny. ?So was that all you wanted to tell me?? he asked, feeling depressed. ?Are you kidding?? Fueled by the fourth gulp of martini number two, Rusty whipped a cell phone out of her limited edition Snapdragon Louis Vuitton purse. ?Get ready, Danny-boy. I'm calling Sig Castle atRed Letter. I'm going to get him to give you a job!? Red Letterwas the most prestigious literary journal in the world. Started five years ago by the German poet Siegfried Castle in an abandoned warehouse in East Berlin, it had recently been bought by Cond? Nast and moved to New York, where it was currently thriving in its role as the rogue avant-garde child of the publishers ofVogue andLucky. Rusty started dialing before Dan even had a chance to respond. Sure, working atRed Letter would be an honor, but he wasn't really in the market for a job right now. ?But I'm still in school,? he muttered. His agent tended to forget sometimes that he was only seventeen and therefore couldn't meet her for midmorning espressos on a Monday or fly to London on the spur of the moment to attend a poetry reading. Or hold a full-time job. ?Sig-Sig, it's Rusty,? she crooned. ?Listen, babes, I'm sending you a poet. He's got potential, but he could use a little sharpening up. Got me?? Siegfried Castle?Dan still couldn't believe Rusty was actually talking tothe Siegfried Castle?said something Dan couldn't hear. Rusty thrust the phone at him. ?Sig wants a word.? Dan's hands dripped with sweat as he held the phone to his nervous ear and croaked, ?Hello?? ?I hawen't gut a cwue vho you ahr, but Wuthsty cweated dat vantastic Mystewy Cwaze, so I thuppose I muthst take you athswell, yah?? lisped Siegfried Castle in a snooty German accent. Dan could barely understand a word, except for the Mystery Craze part. How come everyone had heard of Mystery and no one had heard ofhim ? After all, he'd been published inThe New Yorker. ?Thank you so much for the opportunity,? he responded meekly. ?I have next week off school for spring break, so I can work all day. Once break is over, I can only come after school.? Rusty grabbed the phone away from him. ?He'll be there Monday morning,? she pronounced. ?Bye-bye, Sig-Sig.? Clicking off, she tossed her phone into her purse and groped for her martini. ?We used to be lovers, but it's better now that we're friends,? she confessed. She reached out and pinched one of Dan's pale, confused cheeks. ?Aw. You're Sig-Sig's new intern, his cutie-patootie little intern!? Rusty made it sound so demeaning, as if Dan would be spending his workdays stirring Siegfried Castle's decaf mochas and sharpening his pencils. But an internship atRed Letter was such a prestigious, impossible-to-get job, he couldn't possibly complain. ?So, isRed Letter named after the letterA foradulteress that Hester Prynne had to wear inThe Scarlet Letter?? he asked, genuinely interested. Rusty stared at him quizzically. ?Fuck if I know.? Why s and b are still friends ?I made us tea.? Serena pointed to the white cups and saucers sitting on her orange plastic lunch tray. She sniffed and wiped her nose on the sleeve of her pale green Calypso blouse. ?With honey.? Blair permitted Serena to sit down across from her at the blond wood cafeteria table and accepted the tea. She had a terrible cold. Tea with honey would be just the thing. Besides, she and Serena always sat together at lunchtime, especially when they had peer group, for which they were both leaders. Plus there was something Blair needed to ask her. The cafeteria was crowded with girls pouring ketchup over their sweet potato fries and trading gossip about spring break. ?I heard Serena and Nate Archibald got arrested for doing it on a chairlift,? Rain Hoffstetter whispered to Laura Salmon. ?I heard she's moving to Amsterdam after graduation. She met this guy from the Dutch Olympic snowboarding team. They're getting married,? Kati Farkas told them. ?And Blair's dad is trying to get her into Brown now,? Isabel Coates piped up. ?Because she and Erik van der Woodsen are totally in love.? ?Nothing happened, you know, between Nate and me,? Serena declared after she'd sat down. She took a sip of her tea. Actually, somethinghad happened between them, but that was a long time ago. ?I mean, after Georgie's party.? Blair stirred her tea. She and Serena had been ignoring each other ever since the party in Sun Valley, mostly because it was easier and more exciting to let the other girl imagine what had happened than to admit the embarrassing truth. She pushed her tea aside and rested her elbows on the table, staring at Serena intently. ?What was it like??
