Nate stood frozen in the doorway, blinking. Blair's clothes were on the floor and her delicate hand with its little ruby ring was curled around the neck of somebody blond. The blond person turned his head, proving not to be a member of the Dutch Olympic snowboarding team?thankfully?but Erik van der Woodsen, Serena's older brother. Which wasn't much better. ?Sorry,? Nate muttered. ?I just needed some stuff out of the closet.? ?Um, can you come back later? We're kind of busy,? Erik said, without a hint of embarrassment. Nate just stood there staring at them with his hands in his pockets. He needed some sort of explanation or acknowledgment from the bottom half of the Erik-Blair nooky sandwich before he could turn his back. But Blair just lay there with her eyes closed. Erik had almost talked her body into going on the trip she'd wanted to take in the first place, but at the sound of Nate's voice, she canceled the flight. Finally she heard the sound of the door closing and Nate's footsteps hurrying down the hall. Then she rose up on her elbows and inched her body away from Erik's, pulling the sheet up over her chest to cover herself. ?Actually, this was going to be my first time,? she admitted, blushing with shame for lying about it when he'd asked. ?But I guess I'm not ready.? She looked up at Erik, her blue eyes round, hoping with all her heart he wouldn't be too mad. Erik's adorable lips curled up in a half smile. ?Nah. You're ready. I'm just not the right guy, that's all.? And it's no secret who is.

I know, I know, it's seems like forever since we last talked. Spring break is almost over, and by the sound of it, everyone has been pretty busy not thinking about the college acceptance letters that are due in our mailboxes in only two weeks. Yes, we've been busy, busy,busy . But before I get down towho 's gotten intowhat troublewhere , let me first clarify a few things in no particular order. a) The members of the Dutch Olympic snowboarding team are notall gay or married or boring. I know this because I hooked up with one of them very briefly when my family was skiing in Banff. His name was Jansen, and he was gorgeous beyond belief. b) If you are still a virgin when you go off to college, you won't be the only one. I know this ? well, just because I know. c) It is not a federal offense to drop mail into a river, unless you work for the postal service. d) Itis a federal offense not to answer a girl's e-mail when all she wants is for you to forgive her and kiss and make up. It is also a federal offense to receive a gift and not say thank you.And it is very definitely a federal offense to run naked down a public road, especially when the police are chasing you?see news below. e) Last but not least, as much as I hate to say it, we all feel better about ourselves when we aren't fighting with our parents. Glad we got that cleared up. Now, the latest news ? Infamous Connecticut heiress and Upper East Side boy-about-town arrested for indecent exposure She shocked us by selling her favorite show pony for drug money, and he shocked us by appearing, all greased up, in a European aftershave commercial. Now they're at it again.G andC were arrested last night for prancing around on a public road,in the buff . It was later discovered that both were under the influence of all manner of substances and that they had also stolen a ski patrol toboggan, which was returned by authorities to ski patrol headquarters. Both parties were released on bail this morning and were flown home to Greenwich and New York, respectively, by private jet. It is rumored that both the Wood River Police Department and the Sun Valley Ski Patrol have already received substantial ?anonymous? donation checks to keep quiet about the matter.G is already back at Breakaway, where she has earned a lifetime membership.C has been grounded, which means he may no longer use his family's suite at the Tribeca Star Hotel or his mother's chauffeur-driven town car. Poor baby. It has also been rumored that a very beautiful model/Upper East Side schoolgirl was involved in the incident, but she managed to avoid the police and escape. Later that evening, a mysterious handsome local boy escorted her back to her hotel. That's our girl!&nbsp; Sightings Vlooking longingly at the film cameras in the window of49th Street Photo , like a kid at the window of a pet store. Poor thing can't wait till her parents go home.B andE and a bunch ofSun Valley Ski Patrol guys having a beer at a local bar inKetchum, Idaho , with?believe it or not? no apparent sexual tension. I've heard this can happen to girls once they ?you know . They lose their need to flirt. J creeping around the Upper East Side again, hiding behind trees. What's her deal, anyway?S and her brother,E , tearing up the slopes on their own inSun Valley .&nbsp; Your e-mail&nbsp; Q:Dear GG, I have known a certain boy my whole life and I'm pretty sure I've been in love with him all that time, I just never realized it. He was with my best friend and now he's with another friend of mine, although I'm pretty sure that's close to being over. I need to find out if he feels the same way about me, but I'm not sure what to do.&nbsp; ?lost A:Dear lost, You know what I do when I'm not sure what to do? Grab him. Just kiss him and everything will fall into place from there. If he feels the same way, you'll know. And if he doesn't, you'll know. Good luck, sweetie.&nbsp; ?GG Q:Dear Gossip Girl, I love your page. You are a cool girl. I want to find out your name, because I think you may be the same girl I just met skiing. I might never meet you again because I live very far from America, but I will always love you from afar.&nbsp; ?Jan A:Dear Jan, I have a feeling we did meet, a long time ago. And even if I'm not the girl you're talking about, you have my permission to love me from afar. But let's keep it that way, okay?&nbsp; ?GG See you back at school next week. It might actually be kind of nice to sleep in our own beds again. You know you love me.&nbsp; gossip girl
