The cigarette he'd been smoking on the walk from the subway had burned down to the quick, singeing his fingers. He tossed it onto the sidewalk, hoping that someone fromRed Letter wasn't watching disapprovingly from a window. ?I'm Daniel Humphrey? The new intern?? The heavily grated door buzzed, and Dan pushed it open. He wiped his sweaty hands on his pants as he mounted the stairs in front of him. Already he could see the glare of office lights, hear thetap, tap, tap of computer keyboards, the hum of fax machines, photocopiers, and printers, and the steady murmur of voices talking on the phone. He reached the top stair and surveyed the open-plan office, full of strange heads bent over desks, talking on the phone and looking busy, busy, busy. Bisecting the white walls was a thin, horizontal red line, making it look like the large room had been wrapped with red ribbon. When he squinted, though, Dan could see that the line was made up of thousands of tiny words painted in red. He wondered what it said, but in order to get close enough he'd have to lean over someone's desk, and he didn't want to be rude. He waited for someone to greet him and show him around?someone there must have buzzed him in, after all?but no one seemed to notice him. Even in his fancy new suit? He shifted from foot to foot and cleared his throat noisily. Nothing. ?Um,? he spoke to the guy sitting nearest him. The guy had dark, slicked-back hair and was wearing a crisp white shirt with French cuffs tucked into neatly pressed black trousers that were probably made by Armani or Gucci or something. There were four unopened minibottles of San Pellegrino mineral water lined up on the desk in front of him. ?I'm here to see Siegfried Castle,? Dan told him. The guy looked up and squinted at Dan.?Pourquoi?? Dan frowned. Couldn't the guy just speak English? ?Because I'm his new intern?? The guy stood up. ?And I ham your new boss.? He held out his hand, palm up. ?Siegfried Castle. Call me Sig?no, actzuelly, I zink you must call mesir .? Dan wasn't sure how to handle the palm-up scenario. Boldly he put his hand on top of Siegfried Castle's and turned it around, shaking it up and down like a normal person would. Siegfried Castle grimaced and removed his hand. ?You're a poet, no?? Dan nodded, his eyes shifting nervously to the other people in the office. They were all looking up now, examining him coldly. He noticed now that everyone else had those little green bottles of San Pellegrino lined up on their desks, too. And they were all dressed in black and white, just like Mr. Castle. Dan felt like a freak in his light blue shirt and gray suit. ?Yes. I had a poem in the Valentine's Day issue ofThe New Yorker last month. Maybe you saw it? It's called ?Sluts.?? Siegfried Castle didn't seem to hear him, and Dan wondered if there was some sort of rivalry betweenRed Letter andThe New Yorker . Maybe he'd committed a horrible faux pas by mentioning the competition. ?Now. I show you my out box. My in box. My files. Show you the slush pile. Show you the photocopier. The phone. The fax. You sit there. I call you for things. We eat at one-thirty in conference room. You will order our food.? He was pointing around the office, and Dan realized that Mr. Castle wasn't going to show him anything else or introduce him to anyone. The tour was over. The phone rang, and Siegfried Castle sat down again and pointed at it with a neatly manicured finger. Dan picked up the phone. ?Hello?? He winced, realizing he should have said something more professional. ?May I help you?? ?Who the fuck are you?? the voice on the other end said in an English accent. ?Get me the Zigster, pronto.? He held the phone out to Mr. Castle, who he noticed had a few gray hairs and was probably older than he looked. ?It's for you, I think.? Dan sat down in what was presumably his chair in the corner, facing the wall. There was nothing on the desk. No computer, no phone. Not even any San Pellegrino. He wondered if he should go around and introduce himself to the other people in the office, but he didn't really want to bother them while they were working. He squinted up at the red line of words running along the wall, but the more he looked at them, the more they seemed to dance and blur together. He glanced sideways at Mr. Castle's out box. It had a letter in it. ?Would you like me to mail that for you?? he asked. Siegfried popped a cigarette into his mouth and flicked open his silver Zippo lighter. Then he threw the unlit cigarette into the trash can beneath his desk. ?Go ahead,? he said spitefully, as if he couldn't wait to get rid of Dan. ?Also, I need caviar.? He pulled a hundred-dollar bill out of his pocket. ?Gourmet Garage on Seventh Avenue.Not beluga. It's zee black one in the blue tin.? As ifanyone would know what he was talking about? Dan took the money and the letter and went outside. The envelope wasn't stamped, and he had no idea where the post office was, but surely there was one nearby, and he could smoke a cigarette while he was looking for it. Ten blocks later he still hadn't found the post office, but he'd smoked four cigarettes on a pier overlooking the Hudson River. ?I have to get back,? he told himself, and tossed his cigarette into the water. But how could he go back with the envelope in hand, looking like a dope because he couldn't figure out where to buy a stamp? He leaned against the railing, and before he could stop and think about what he was doing, he tossed the envelope into the swirling brown water. It floated on top for a minute, turned beige and wet-looking, and then sank.
