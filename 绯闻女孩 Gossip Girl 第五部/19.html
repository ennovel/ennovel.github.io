Vanessa glared at her older sister, too furious to say anything. Then Arlo blew his nose again, his chest heaving with sobs. Vanessa was sort of worried he might be having a heart attack or something.&nbsp; ?Dad?? ?We just had no idea you were so ?artistic ,? Gabriela faltered. ?No idea.? It wasn't exactly a compliment, but Vanessa hadn't exactly been fishing for compliments. Her films were so dark and weird, hardly anyone ever really liked them. Arlo grabbed the remote and switched the TV on again. They'd been watching the reinterpretation she'd done of a scene fromWar and Peace, starring none other than Dan. The camera followed a scrap of dirty paper being blown by the wind through Madison Square Park at sunset and then settled on Dan, lying collapsed on a park bench. It zoomed in on his face, and Vanessa's heart dropped into her knees. ?Can we turn that off now?? she pleaded. But no one paid any attention. ?It's not just that you can tell a story,? Arlo gushed, entranced. ?But the way you do it, like a painter.? He turned his teary, bloodshot eyes to Vanessa. ?You put us all to shame.? ?She got into NYU early, too, cuz she's so freakin' good,? Ruby burbled proudly. Vanessa's face burned. ?Shut up.? Gabriela wrapped a tentative, kimonoed arm around her shoulder. ?We're so proud of you, Eggplant,? she whispered, using the endearing name Vanessa hadn't heard since she was a baby. Then Arlo came over and hugged the both of them, his face damp with tears. Ruby reached out to rub his back, and soon the four of them were wrapped in a group hug even the hippiest of hippies couldn't top. It was totally un-Vanessa, but it wasn't like anyone was filming it or anything. ?Jordy's going to come stay with us for a while this summer. Is that all right?? Gabriela murmured while they were still hugging. Ruby snorted. ?I don't think she minds what you do with Jordy.? ?Oh, I thought you liked him,? her mother said. ?I do,? Vanessa faltered. And Jordy was nice while he lasted. ?I just?? ?She likes that Dan friend of hers from the picture a bit better,? Arlo interrupted, as if reading her mind. ?He's really got something.? Ruby giggled, and Vanessa kicked her in her leather pants. Yeah, Dan definitely had something, and she was pretty sure she knew what it was.
<br> &nbsp;Her.

Isn't it great to be back? Isn't it great to be back andstill not know where we're going to school next year? Isn't it great to be back when it feels like our lives are hanging in the balance and we're all going completely bonkers? Well, here's a little something to look forward to: Calling all boys You know you want to meet me, and here's your chance. Tomorrow is our first day back at school, and the weather is supposed to be unseasonably warm and beautiful. As soon as school lets out, you'll find me lying on a red blanket, soaking up the sun on the grass in Sheep Meadow. You are all welcome to join me, and you are also all welcome to bring snacks and beverages. No pretzels or Gatorade, please. Sorry, girls, but this is a boys-only invite. Boys have never been as good at waiting as we are, and you know what they say?the best things come to people who wait.&nbsp; Your e-mail&nbsp; Q:Dear GG, You know that crazy girlN met in rehab? Well, I live down the road from her, and we went to Greenwich Saints together until she got kicked out. Anyway, I heard my parents talking about how she was in jail in Sun Valley for indecent exposure, and it's so crazy because her mom was in South America and had no idea she was even there so that kidC 's parents had to bail her out, too, even though they didn't even know her.
<br> &nbsp;?Conngurl&nbsp; A:Dear Conngurl, That would explain a lot, I guess. And I have to say,C 's parents deserve a medal for their generosity. Personally, I think she might have benefited from a few extra nights in the slammer. But what I really want to know is?what did they give her to wear in her jail cell??
<br> &nbsp;?GG&nbsp; Q:Dear GossipGurl, ok, so i'm not a stalking pervert, but i did sort of follow this boy i have a total crush on down to s's building and then sat on the met steps in the rain, waiting for him to come out, which he didn't until way after dark and now i have a really bad cold. i feel so stupid.
<br> &nbsp;?atishoo&nbsp; A:Dear atishoo, That's a little sad. Although I know which boy you're talking about, and had I spotted him on the street I probably would've done the same thing. What hasS got that we haven't? Don't answer that?we're jealous enough of her as it is. BTW, I have a cold, too!&nbsp; ?GG&nbsp; Q:Dear GG, I heard college acceptance letters are coming late this year because the schools can't decide whether to increase class size or just reject people. They're having a secret forum about it this week.&nbsp; ?ino&nbsp; A:Dear ino, I don't talk to people who spread stupid rumors about college acceptance letters. We're all paranoid enough as it is.&nbsp; ?GG&nbsp; Sightings Bin theWicker Garden buying an adorable yellow cashmere bunny rabbit?probably the first cashmere item ever she didn't a) buy for herself or b) steal.N staring up atB 's building on Seventy-second Street like it had all the answers. Don't count on it, sweet pea.J and her gangly girlfriend stalking that poor boy from theSmale School again. What is it with those two?D on theL train toWilliamsburg .D not getting off theL train in Williamsburg.V filming new grass growing inCentral Park ?I'm not kidding, she's that serious about her work.&nbsp; P.S. I won't totally spoil it for you, but has anyone seenC lately? He has a new little friend, and I'm dying to know where it came from. It's so exotic! See you in the park, boys!! You know you love me. gossip girl
