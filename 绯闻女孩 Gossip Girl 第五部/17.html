Supposedly, the daffodils represented hope, although Vanessa wasn't exactly sure what the fishing net itself was supposed to represent. The net was scratchy and was cutting up her hands, and Jordy was annoying her with the way he was suddenly all interested in her parents and their work. He'd even taken his shoes off when he came inside, just like they did, and he was wearing a beaded peace-sign necklace that he'd probably stolen out of a box of his mom's old things. Needless to say, the sound of the buzzer was a welcome signal to Vanessa to drop what she was doing andrun . ?I'll get it!? she shouted, stuffing a daffodil into Jordy's helpful hands. She hurried over to the intercom. ?Hello?? ?Postal service with a package, ma'am.? Vanessa buzzed the postman in. He reached the top of the stairs and handed over a box. It was addressed to her, and Dan's name and address were written in the upper left hand corner. She closed the door and sat down on the floor, tearing open the package with her teeth. Inside, wrapped in newspaper, was a bright pink plastic spaceship with three plastic little girls standing on top of it. The little girls had matching black pigtails and matching green plastic dresses. She turned the toy over and flicked the power switch to on, then set the toy down on the floor. A crazy Japanese dance song began to play as the girls on the spaceship whirled around and around and little plastic lights flashed on and off at their feet. It was tacky and horrible?superfantastically so. ?What on Mother Earth?? Gabriela exclaimed, coming over to look. ?Who would send you such a thing?? That wonderful boy you thought I might marry one day? ?I like it,? Vanessa declared. ?It's so bad, it's good.? Jordy walked over with a garland of daffodils draped around his neck. He frowned down at the thing like it was supposed to make sense. ?What is it?? ?It's just a thing,? Vanessa replied, the ideas for her next film already stacking up in her brain. ?Hey, could you come down here for a minute?? she asked, thinking of Jordy's nose. He bent down eagerly and she closed one eye, cupping her fingers around the other eye to form a camera-lens view of his astounding nose, the crazy pink spaceship toy whirling and flashing in the background. Sounds like an Oscar winner already. ?Stay right there.? Vanessa sprinted toward her room to retrieve her camera from the closet. If she was fast, her parents wouldn't even notice what she was doing. ?Hold it,? she whispered, holding the camera to her eye as she zoomed in on Jordy's nose, making sure to leave the peace-sign necklace and the daffodils out of the frame. ?Okay, got it.? She turned the camera off and tossed it into her black book bag by the door. From across the living room, her father was watching her curiously, the flashing lights from the toy setting his eyes aglow. She headed back into her room to gather some more supplies. From now on, she'd have to take the spaceship and the camera with her wherever she went, capturing whatever crazy thing she fancied, the spaceship being the only constant, forever in the background. ?Can I stand up now?? Jordy asked when she came back. He was still kneeling awkwardly in front of the spaceship, his eyes woozy from listening to its insane song over and over. Vanessa grabbed the toy and switched it off, tucking it and her extra batteries and lenses into her bag. ?Yeah, you can go,? she told him absently. Meaning she had no use for him anymore. ?Hey, where areyou going?? Ruby shouted at her from the kitchenette. Vanessa could already tell from Ruby's tone of voice that her sister knew exactly what she was up to. She laced up her Doc Martens and pulled the black windbreaker she'd bought at the army-navy store on over her head. ?Out,? she shouted back as she banged through the door, her father's eyes burning curious holes into her back as she went. The answer may be written on the bathroom wall Petite mignonette, sweet coquette I taste your cookies, your bread You fill my plate On his last day at work before school started again, Dan stood in front of the toilet in theRed Letter men's room reading and rereading the words he'd written on the scrap of paper that had disappeared from his desk a week ago. He'd found the other poem he'd written using that same last line?you fill my plate?and he'd intended to reword the line in this new poem. But it was his fleeting glimpse of Elise holding a baguette that had inspired the poem, and both his interest in her and his interest in finishing the poem had completely diminished. Did that have anything to do with a certain e-mail he might have received recently? The redundant line was not the main reason he couldn't stop staring at the words on the bathroom wall. The words he was staring at weren't even his. Whoever had copied his fragment of a poem onto the wall had written underneath it,Note to self: See above for how notto write . Okay, so what he'd written was sappy and girly and didn't make much sense. He'd be the first to admit that. But insulting someone's writing so deliberately was just downright ? mean and immature. It was like talking trash about your mother: Onlyyou were allowed to do it. ?Bastards,? Dan muttered under his breath as he flushed the toilet. He dug a black Sharpie out of his back pocket and began to scrawl next to his poem. Notes on how not to be an asshole: 1. Don't steal stuff from people's desks, especially when they don't know you well enough to think it's funny. 2. Never assume a poem is finished. In fact, never assume anything, because when you ASSuME, you make anassout of uand me. 3. Go fuck yourself, because no one else will. He stuffed the pen back into his pocket, washed his hands, and kicked open the door, almost trampling over Siegfried Castle. ?Kid,? Mr. Castle addressed him in his awkward German accent. ?I am haffing some calls about checks zat never arrived. But you mailed zem yourself last veek. Wusty just called to say Mystewy Cwaze is trapped in Helsinki because Wusty can't wire her traveling money.? Dan walked over to his desk and picked up his black messenger bag. He was tempted to tell Sig Castle that Mystery's check was on its way to Helsinki via the Hudson River, but he didn't want to get fired?he wanted to quit. Mr. Castle had followed him to his desk and was staring him down with his mean German eyes. ?Why don't you find someone else to be your slave,? Dan hissed. He climbed on top of his chair to read the words written in the red horizontal line that was painted around the room.Red Letter, Red Letter, Red Letter, was all it said, over and over. ?That's real creative,? he added, hopping off the chair. And then he walked out. Within thirty seconds of his leaving, his cell phone rang obnoxiously in his back pocket. Dan knew without looking at it who was calling. ?Fuck me, kid. NO ONE, I mean NO ONE, quits a job atRed Letter !? Rusty Klein shouted at him. ?You're supposed to be ABSORBING the aura of literary genius. You're supposed to DO AS YOU'RE TOLD. You're just an APPRENTICE, for chrissakes. You can't QUIT!? Dan strode up Seventh Avenue South with the phone pressed against his ear, determined not to let Rusty ruin the tingly feeling of triumph coursing through his body. ?Sorry, but I don't really get what mailing people's mail or buying caviar or making photocopies has to do with writing good poems.? Rusty was silent?at least for a moment. ?Hop in a cab, doll. I'll meet you at the Plaza in ten. I think I know how to handle this.? Dan stood at the head of the stairs down into the subway at Fourteenth Street. He thought about how Rusty had tried to talk him into taking a break from school to write a memoir, which was so totally not what he wanted to do. He wanted to go to college to have new experiences and learn how to write better, and he didn't need an agent to do it. ?That's okay, I think I can handle it myself. Actually, I think I can handleme myself. At least for a while, anyway.? Rusty didn't answer right away. He could hear the phones ringing and her assistant, Buckley, frantically answering them. Dan waited for her to shout something at him about how he didn't know what was good for him, but instead she just said, ?You're sure about this?? ?Yeah,? Dan said firmly. ?Thanks.? ?Well, fuck me. Have a good one, then.? ?You too,? Dan said earnestly before hanging up. Rusty Klein was crazy and intimidating and kind of a bully, but he would miss her all the same. He ducked into the donut shop behind him and ordered an extra large black coffee and a jelly donut, dialing Vanessa's number as he waited. His hands shook as he carried the huge, hot cup of coffee outside. He set it on the ground, lit a cigarette, and waited as the phone rang and rang. ?Hey,? he said when her machine picked up. ?I sent you something. I was wondering if you got it.? He took a long drag on his cigarette, trying to think of what else to say. ?It's Dan, by the way. Hope you're okay. Um ? bye,? he added, and hung up. Well, it wasn't exactly ?Sorry and let's get back together,? but at least it broke the ice. Sometimes the truth bites Leo was standing in front of the black metal gate, waiting for her. ?Hey,? Jenny said, her cheeks flushed with the notion that she had invited herself over. Leo fumbled with the lock on the gate. He nodded at the bike learning against the metal trash cans in the entryway. ?Dad rides that around the park a few times every morning. He's really fit for his age.? Jenny had never even heard Leo mention his father. She'd always imagined him fatherless and lonely in his mother's huge pink-and-white Park Avenue spread, watching TV and brushing that spoiled dog of hers with a gold hairbrush while his mom was out spending the millions she'd received in the divorce settlement on designer dog jackets and dinners with younger men. ?Hey guys, I'm home,? Leo called into the apartment as he opened the door. ?Here,? he told Jenny, taking her black parka and hanging it over his. ?Come on.? Jenny followed him down the dark, narrow hallway. The apartment smelled of stale popcorn and Pine-Sol. The white paint on the walls was cracked and peeling, and the plain burgundy rug was worn and linty. It reminded her of her house, only worse. ?Mom, Dad, this is Jennifer, the girl I've been telling you about.? Jenny's jaw almost dropped to her new red suede Steve Madden retro sneakers when she got a glimpse of Mr. and Mrs. Berensen. They were wearing matching gray sweat suits and eating microwave popcorn, their feet propped up on a glass-topped rattan coffee table as they watched TV in their tiny, dark living room. Mrs. Berensen was petite, with short white hair and bright blue eyes surrounded by tiny smile wrinkles. Mr. Berensen was at least eighty, with white hair, long, bony limbs, and a tanned, leathery face. They were both so skinny, they looked like they lived on a diet of only popcorn and water. ?It's really nice ? to meet you,? Jenny faltered. She stepped forward to shake their hands. ?Oh, aren't you a doll,? Mrs. Berensen declared. ?We were just watching some old James Bond flick,? Mr. Berensen said. ?Sit down and watch if you like.? He grunted as he shifted over on the burgundy velour couch to make room for them. Jenny didn't know how he could possibly make it around the park on a bike. It looked as if he was going to keel over and die right there. ?That's okay.? Leo touched Jenny's elbow. ?Come on, I'll show you my room.? Jenny bit her lip as she followed him into the adjoining room. She hated herself for feeling disappointed. Why should she care if Leo wasn't a prince living in an exclusive doorman building on Park Avenue? Because a guy's gotta have something more than a sweet disposition and a cute chipped tooth! Leo's room was even more depressing than the rest of the apartment. Just a single bed pushed up against the wall, with some kind of synthetic yellow-and-green-plaid coverlet on it that looked as if it belonged in a motel circa 1979, plain white walls, a linty brown rug, and a scratched wooden desk with a giant Mac on it. The computer was very definitely the newest, most expensive thing the Berensens owned. Jenny perched on the edge of the bed and sneezed violently. She was having an allergic reaction to this entire situation.
