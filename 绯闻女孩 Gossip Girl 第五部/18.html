Leo sat down on his stiff wooden desk chair and jiggled the mouse until the computer sprang awake. ?This is what I do most of the time I'm not in school or with you.? ?Oh?? Jenny wondered if he was about to show her some weird chat room he went to to pretend he was somebody else. ?Come here and I'll show you.? Reluctantly she stood up and went over to look, expecting to have to read through a bunch of annoying e-mails. Instead, it was a painting, an exact replica of Marc Chagall'sBirthday, with some little flourishes that were all Leo's own. ?You did that?? Jenny asked, when she had found her voice. Itwas very good. ?Yeah, but it's not finished yet. I have to do something about the windowpane. It's a little too bleak.? He started opening menus of color palettes and shading techniques. ?I could outline it in gold. ?? He glanced up at Jenny. ?What do you think?? Jenny walked back to the bed again because there was nowhere else to sit. She bounced up and down on it a few times in an effort to clear her head. ?I really thought you lived in that fancy apartment on Park. I thought Daphne was your dog.? She stopped bouncing, looked down at the rug, and swallowed. ?I guess I sort of wanted you to think that. That's why I took you there.? Jenny looked up. Leo looked a lot less dashing and handsome slumped at his desk chair in his hideous room. ?But Elise said she heard you were at that benefit at the Frick. And you have that nice leather jacket.? She tucked her hands under her thighs. ?I thought that's where you lived,? she repeated. Leo shook his head. ?I walk Henry for Madame T after school. She invites me to things like the party at the Frick and gives me memberships to the museums 'cause she knows I like art and her kids are all grown. It's pretty nice of her, actually.? Jenny nodded. Why was it so hard to accept what she already knew? Leo was just a normal boy who walked dogs after school. And had really old parents and lived in a really dark, depressing apartment. Sure he was into art and so was she, but there had to be more ?something . Suddenly she scooted off the bed and lunged for the phone. ?Let's do something crazy and romantic! We can steal a bottle of wine from your parents and take it to the park and sit out under the stars and get drunk!? Leo looked dumbstruck. ?Maybeyou're the mysterious one,? he remarked with a confused smile. ?My parents don't have any wine, and besides, it's a school night. I have to cook dinner and do my homework. You're welcome to stay and eat with us.? Dinner with Leo's emaciated thousand-year-old parents who didn't even drink wine? There was nothing crazy or romantic aboutthat ! Jenny didn't know what was wrong with her, but if she didn't bust out of Leo's tiny room very soon, she was going to explode. ?I think I have to go now,? she muttered, practically running for the door. Her face was hot, and she couldn't possibly stop to say good-bye to his parents. The front door was only eight feet down the hall. She lunged for her coat, already anticipating the cool air on her cheeks and the soothing bus ride across town. ?Wait!? she heard Leo call after her, but she was already gone. Elise had told her to figure out if the real Leo was someone she could like. Now she had the answer. And it wasn't pretty. B feels the first flush of sisterhood ?It's so wonderful to see you home!? Blair's mother gushed when Blair stepped out of the elevator, wheeling her Louis Vuitton valises. Mookie, Aaron's dog, waggled up to her and rubbed his butt against her knees. ?Fuck off,? Blair hissed at him under her breath, even though she was kind of glad to be home. She took off her coat and tossed it onto the antique settee in the corner of the foyer. ?Hi, Mom. Where's Kitty Minky?? Eleanor waddled over and kissed Blair noisily. Then she handed her the phone. ?It's your father, dear. We've been having the most wonderful chat.? As far as Blair knew, her parents hadn't spoken to each other?civilly, that is?in over a year. ?Dad?? she said, taking the phone. ?Blair Bear,? her dad's cheerful, wine-infused voice darted over the airwaves from his chateau in France.??a va bien?? ?Sort of,? Blair replied. ?Haven't heard from Yale yet?? ?Nope.? Blair hadn't given her father any inkling that her chances at Yale?his alma mater?were almost completely destroyed. She wandered down the hallway to her old room and stood in the doorway. ?Not yet.? ?All right. Well, be nice to your mother. She's absolutely glowing, isn't she?? ?I guess.? Blair walked into the room and sat down on the floor. ?I miss you, Dad.? ?Miss you too, Bear,? her father said before clicking off. ?So what do you think?? Her mother walked into the room behind her, breathing heavily. Her stomach seemed to have expanded about twelve inches while Blair was away, but her face was nicely bronzed from the Hawaii trip, and she looked kind of pretty in a dark-green-and-black Diane von Furstenberg maternity dress. Even her black velvet headband didn't seem so bad. Blair attempted a half-smile from where she sat cross-legged on the floor in the middle of the room. ?You look nice.? ?No, I mean the room.? Blair shrugged and went back to studying the room. The familiar mother-of-pearl-white walls had been repainted the palest yellow-green, with celery green trim and a stenciled daisy border. Instead of her rose-colored Oriental carpet, a creamy yellow shag rug covered the floor. A bassinet stood in the corner, covered with white lace, and inside it was a folded yellow blanket, stitched intricately with white daisies. Along the far wall stood a changing table and an armoire, both painted pale yellow. To Blair's right was a wooden rocking chair with daisies stenciled on its back. Kitty Minky, her cat, lay curled up on a cushion on the seat of the chair, fast asleep. Her mother waddled over to the armoire and ran her hand over the drawers. ?We wanted to monogram all the furniture, but we haven't decided on a name yet.? She smiled brilliantly at Blair. ?Your father suggested that you come up with a name. You've always been so creative, darling. I think it's a wonderful idea!? ?Me?? Blair blanched. This baby had nothing to do with her. Why on earth would they want her to name it? ?Don't worry about it being a Jewish name or anything. Cyrus doesn't care. We just need a good name.? Her mother smiled encouragingly. ?And don't rush into it. Think about it for a while.? She walked over to the bassinet, shook out the yellow daisy blanket and refolded it again. ?Cyrus and I are going to the 21 Club now for a wine tasting. Let Myrtle know what you want for dinner, and she'll fix you something.? She bent down to kiss Blair on top of her head. ?Just a good name,? she repeated before leaving the room. Blair stayed where she was, contemplating the color scheme and her new role of Big Sister, Namer of Babies. Her room didn't even smell the same. It smelled new, new and full of promise. ?I've been pushing for Daisy,? Aaron said, ambling into the room in a pair of maroon flannel Harvard boxer shorts and nothing else. His baby dreadlocks had grown past his ears again, and his bare chest was tan from his week in Hawaii. He would've looked good if he wasn't so annoying. ?How was Hawaii?? Blair asked, although she really didn't care. Aaron's dark eyes widened excitedly. ?Even better than I thought. I met this girl who's like, even more into being a vegetarian than me. Her parents are Haitian refugees. From Berkeley. She taught me to surf. We had some trippy times.? Blair raised her eyebrows, unimpressed. ?But now you're back,? she remarked. He nodded. ?So, what do you think of Daisy?for the kid's name?? She wrinkled her nose. ?Duh, Harvard Boy, that's way too obvious.? She twirled her ruby ring around and around on her finger. ?So what was that Haitian girl's name, anyway?? Aaron frowned. ?Yael. She said a lot of people say it like ?Yai-elle? or something, but she pronounced just like the school: Yale.? ?Yale.? Blair stopped twirling her ring, the corners of her mouth curving up into a smile. ?Yale.?&nbsp; Of course. S and n get it out of their systems With Blair out of the apartment, there was no reason not to invite Nate over. ?Hey,? he said when she greeted him at the door. It felt kind of strange seeing Serena back in her old surroundings. But it was also kind of nice. ?Hey.? She kissed his cheek and helped him out of his rain-soaked trench coat, hanging it neatly in the coat closet. His gray Abercrombie T-shirt looked worn and soft, and she couldn't wait to get her hands on it. ?Sorry things got so weird at the party,? she said. Thinking about it now, she didn't know why she hadn't kissed Nate back in Sun Valley, after he'd rescued her from the ditch and she was already naked and everything. Well, she'd just have to get naked again, wouldn't she? ?That's okay.? Nate seemed to be waiting for something, like an explanation for why she'd summoned him there. She took a step toward him, her bare feet cold on the hardwood floor. She was wearing only a thin white cotton undershirt and a denim miniskirt, and she shivered, partly from the chill, but mostly out of nervous anticipation. Nate reached out and rubbed her bare arms. ?Nate?? Serena asked, collapsing into him. She could feel his breath on her face.Oh, Natie . ?You know how we're always such good buds and we understand each other perfectly and we're always there for each other, even when things get really messed up?? ?Uh-huh,? Nate replied hoarsely, still rubbing his hands up and down her arms. ?Well, why can't we justbe together?? Nate stopped rubbing. It was impossible even to think of saying no to the most gorgeous girl in his entire universe when she was already one of his best friends and was practically throwing herself at him. Maybe if he just gave her a little kiss and told her gently that it wasn't meant to be ? He leaned in and kissed her, very tentatively, on the mouth. A nice, sweet, innocent kiss. But Serena wasn't looking for sweet and innocent, she was looking for true love, and she kissed him back hungrily, like someone who had been waiting for this for a long, long time. She grabbed his hand and pulled him into her bedroom. ?Hey,? Nate said, stopping in the doorway. ?Is Blair still staying here?? ?Hey,? Serena said back, dropping his hand. How could it be true love if Nate was in love with someone else? She sighed and fell back on her bed, smiling sadly up at the ceiling. ?Blair moved back home.? ?Oh.? Nate went over and sat down on the bed next to her. He touched her shoulder. ?Are you okay?? Serena grinned. Even if he wasn't her one true love, Nate was still her sweetie. ?Blair and Erik didn't go all the way,? she told him, because she knew he'd want to know. ?How do you know that?? Nate asked suspiciously. He hadn't missed the fact that Serena and Blair were fighting. Serena rolled onto her stomach and buried her face in her arms like a little girl. ?I asked him?? Her voice was muffled. ?Heis my brother, you know.? Nate didn't say anything. He was relieved, but he wasn't going to tell her that. She propped herself up on her elbows. ?You know I love you, Natie. But I think we both know who you really wanna be kissing.? Nate nodded and turned his head to look out the rain-spattered window. A big bird was perched on the roof of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He wondered if it was one of those peregrine falcons that were always flying around Central Park, surprising people by not being pigeons. The falcons were elegant and beautiful, and seeing them every now and again was somehow reassuring. He lay down next to Serena and wrapped his arms around her in a brotherly embrace. ?I love you, too,? he whispered in her ear. Serena smiled and closed her eyes. She could imagine herself and Nate lying like this in her dorm room at college?wherever it was she wound up. They would never be a couple, but every once in a while, they would get together and hug and kiss, just like this. It would always be completely harmless, and Blair would never have to know. And eventually they'd stop doing it, when Serenafinally found true love. If that ever happened. V has more talent than a commune full of hippies When Vanessa arrived home, Ruby, Gabriela, and Arlo were huddled around the television, eating raw soybeans and drinking warm sake. ?What's going on? I thought you guys were leaving today.? Vanessa set down her heavy bag of camera equipment and peeled off her jacket. She'd been caught in a sudden downpour and was soaked through. ?They're leavingsoon.? Ruby clicked off the TV, and the three of them flashed the fakest smiles Vanessa had ever seen. ?How was your day, dear?? Vanessa untied her Doc Martens and kicked them off. From the corner of the living room, Ruby's parakeet, Tofu, squawked inside his cage, as if to warn her,Something's up! Something's up! Gabriela stood up and brushed the wrinkles out of the elaborately printed pink-and-purple Japanese kimono she was wearing. Her gray braids were pinned on top of her head, Heidi style. ?What're you guys still doing here, anyway?? Vanessa asked. ?I thought you were going home today.? Her father blew his nose noisily in response. He was wearing a red wool sweater that had very obviously been made for a woman, because the three-quarter-length sleeves pouffed out at the shoulders. Vanessa walked toward him, squinting. His face was all splotchy and his eyes were red. ?Dad, are you sick?? Arlo Abrams shook his head and blew his nose once more. Fresh tears spilled down his cheeks. ?Hush, sweetheart,? Gabriela whispered, although it wasn't clear to whom. ?It's your films,? Ruby finally burst out. She'd never been able to keep quiet about anything. ?I showed them your films.?
