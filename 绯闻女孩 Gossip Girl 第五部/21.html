She, too, had a terrible cold. ?What??&nbsp; ?Sex. With Nate.? Serena crumpled up the napkin and stuck it under her tray so they both wouldn't have to look at it. Was this a trick question? Was Blair just waiting for her to say the wrong thing so she could pounce on her with her claws out and rip Serena's head off with her teeth? ?It was really ?? She paused, waiting for Blair's expression to turn ugly, but Blair just sat there looking genuinely interested.She really wants to know, Serena realized. ?It was amazing. We were both kind of scared, but because it was with Nate, it was fun.? She smiled, remembering. ?And we weren't embarrassed about it afterward.? Blair nodded and looked down at the table. That was all well and good, but what about her? How were she and Nate ever going to do it if they weren't?? Over Serena's shoulder Blair could see the girls from their ninth-grade peer group heading toward the table. It was time to change the subject. ?Never mind,? she muttered, grabbing her bag off the floor to get out the materials for peer group. ?Hey, guys, how was your break?? Mary Goldberg, Vicky Reinerson, and Cassie Inwirth asked the two seniors in unison. The three perky freshman girls were all wearing matching black V-neck sweaters. They set their lunch trays on the table and sat down practically on top of one another. ?Ours was totally crazy.? ?Good,? Blair said without much enthusiasm. She gave each of them a handout. ?If you could just read this before we get started.? The girls glanced down at the handout and giggled as if to say,Like we're really going to talk about that? ?So, Serena, did you have to do any modeling over break? I heard you were in a shoot with the Dutch Olympic snowboarding team, like for some lip balm or something?? Mary Goldberg asked. Serena flashed them a wry smile. The shit people made up about her was so insane, she almost wished it were true. ?Yeah, it was awesome!? The other two members of the group, Jenny Humphrey and Elise Wells, came over carrying their lunches in brown paper bags. Instead of the tired cafeteria salad bar or hot lunch of fish sticks with sweet potato fries, they were eating egg rolls from the Chinese restaurant over on Lex, which they'd had delivered right to the school doors. It was always surprising to discover how crafty the two girls could be when?except for Jenny's gigantic chest?they were the picture of innocence and goodness. ?Jenny is depressed,? Elise announced as she sat down. She pulled a piece of shrimp out of her egg roll and popped it into her mouth. ?She needs advice. Bad.? Jenny nudged her friend irritably. ?I'm fine.? She stared at her egg roll, which was soaking, untouched, in a deep bath of sweet-and-sour sauce. After what she'd done to it, it was basically inedible. ?See, Leo turned out to be totally normal instead of a French duke or something,? Elise explained, as if they all knew exactly who Leo was, or even cared. ?And the only reason he knows stuff about fur and dog boots is because he walks Madame T's dog for her, and we all know she wears a ton of fur.? Blair yawned rudely and dumped a packet of Equal into her tea just for something to do. Hopefully Serena would take care of this one. Suddenly, Serena grabbed the empty Equal packet out of Blair's hand and wrote something on it. Then she passed it back. He's still in love with you,Blair read. The ninth-graders looked back and forth between the two seniors. ?What are you guysdoing ?? Mary Goldberg and Vicky Reinerson whined with annoyance at being left out. Blair folded up the packet of Equal and dropped it into her bag. ?So, who here knows how to knit?? Jenny wasn't sure what the hell was going on. ?I do. I learned at arts camp last summer.? Blair blew her nose. ?Doesn't everyone learn to knit up at boarding school?? she sniffed in Serena's direction. Serena shrugged. ?I never learned, but all the models are doing it. It's all they do backstage at the shows.? ?We've always wanted to learn!? Cassie, Mary, and Vicky piped up. ?Knit?? Elise asked, completely lost. Blair zipped up her Coach hobo bag and stood up. ?Come on,? she told them. ?We're going out to buy yarn. And after school, we're all knitting booties at my house.? Across the cafeteria, that shaved-headed senior weirdo, Vanessa Abrams, was filming their meeting, a crazy pink plastic spaceship whirling and blinking on the table in the foreground. Serena stood up and gathered her things. ?You mean socks,? she countered. ?No.Booties ,? Blair corrected with a smile. At least it was something they could do with their hands besides smoking. And after school would be a great time to start, especially with the boys otherwise occupied. The ninth-graders trailed Serena and Blair out the school's great blue doors, thrilled by the idea of being on a field trip led by the two coolest girls in the entire school. After so many cold months, the warmth of the sun was so intense, it was shocking. ?I'm sorry we were fighting,? Serena told Blair as the group of girls walked east toward Third Avenue. ?It's not even worth it if we always wind up friends again, anyway.? ?That's okay,? Blair said, blinking her eyes slowly like a cat in the sun. Maybe it was the weather, but all of a sudden, she felt strangely optimistic. Every day babies were born and given cool names like Yale; boys and girls who were broken up got back together; best friends fought and made up; and people got into college?particularly a college called Yale. ?It's such a nice day. I think we'd better go to the park after school instead of to my house.? ?I can run home and get a blanket,? Serena offered. ?We can meet in the meadow.?&nbsp; Uh-oh. They couldn't stay away ?Fifty bucks says she won't show,? Anthony Avuldsen challenged his friends. Nate, Anthony, Charlie, and Jeremy had walked over to Sheep Meadow directly after school let out, just to see if a certain popular online personality was actually going to show her face. The weather was fine and a bunch of guys were already throwing a Frisbee around. Nate recognized Jason Pressman, a junior from the St. Jude's lax team, and went over to say hello. ?Didja hear about Holmes?? Jason asked. There was a big bag of pot in his lap, and he was busy rolling tight little joints and lining them up inside an old Altoids tin. ?I heard he was missing.? Nate licked his lips as he watched Jason sprinkle pot inside a neatly folded rolling paper. ?Busted,? Jason said. ?Dude got caught in the Miami airport with like, a bale of hash.? He sealed the joint and dropped it into the tin. ?He's been expelled. Coach says yougotta be lax captain now.? Anthony, Charlie, and Jeremy were rolling their own joints just a little ways away. Nate turned around and grinned at them. It was an even better story that he'd given up lax captain only to get it in the end. Besides, he'd earned it. Jason reached up and slapped Nate's hand, passing him a joint as he did so. ?Nice work, man. Congratulations.? ?Hey, thanks.? Nate held the joint in his fist. ?What a day,? he observed, throwing his head back to catch the sun. Good thing there were more guys around than girls, otherwise the grass would've been wet with drool. The meadow was filling up with private-school boys pretending they just happened to all be in the park at the same time for absolutely no reason. Chuck Bass was sitting cross-legged on a red camping blanket, wearing a black baseball cap withSun Valley Ski Patrol printed on it. Perched on his shoulder was a small white monkey. Yes, that's right. A live one. Chuck was an asshole, but he never ceased to entertain. Nate was too intrigued not to check it out. He lit the joint Jason had given him and walked over. ?What is that, anyway?? he asked, sucking on the joint. ?A snow monkey. From South America.? Chuck scratched the monkey under the chin while the monkey looked up at Nate with trusting golden eyes. ?Sweetie, meet Natie. Natie, meet Sweetie.? ?Where'd you get her?? Chuck sneezed and blew his nose into a pink silk handkerchief. ?Him. Georgie's mom sent him to my parents as a thank-you gift?you know, for getting her out of the whole indecent-exposure fiasco?? He stroked Sweetie's long white tail where it draped over his left shoulder, as though he were wearing an expensive fur stole, only it was still alive. ?Actually, they have snow monkeys in the zoo right here in Central Park, but they're really rare as pets. Mom thinks Sweetie smells, but I have my own apartment now over on Sutton Place. So I get to keep him.? Well, isn't he just the luckiest? ?Cool.? Nate was pretty much over the monkey now and ready to move on to something else. ?Hey, Nate!? Jeremy shouted at him. ?This kid's seeing your old girlfriend. The ninth-grader with the huge boobies!? Twenty feet away, Jeremy, Charlie, and Anthony were talking to some kid with platinum blond hair whom Nate thought looked familiar, but he wasn't sure. He walked over and shook the kid's hand, holding the joint between his lips as he did so, like Humphrey Bogart or something. ?We're notseeing each other,? Leo insisted nervously. ?We sort of met online and then became friends and then?? He stopped and frowned at Nate. ?Hey, I never knew she'd gone out withyou .? He shoved his hands into the pockets of his jeans and kicked at the grass. ?Anyway, now we're not even talking.? Just then, Serena van der Woodsen and Blair Waldorf walked into the meadow, trailed by five younger girls, including Jenny Humphrey, the notorious ?ninth-grader with the huge boobies.? The girls helped Serena spread out a huge red fleece stadium blanket. Then they all sat down cross-legged on top of the blanket in a tight circle. Blair handed each girl a ball of pale yellow yarn and a set of pink metal knitting needles. ?First we have to cast the yarn onto one needle,? Jenny instructed. She made a loop of yarn, stuck the tip of her needle through it, and began casting on. The other girls leaned in, watching closely. Not fifty feet away, Nate continued to puff on his joint. ?But youlike her. I mean, admit it. She's pretty hard not to like.?
