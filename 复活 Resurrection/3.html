<p>When Maslova, wearied out by the long walk, reached the building, accompanied by two soldiers, Prince Dmitri Ivanovitch Nekhludoff, who had seduced her, was still lying on his high bedstead, with a feather bed on the top of the spring mattress, in a fine, clean, well-ironed linen night shirt, smoking a cigarette, and considering what he had to do to-day, and what had happened yesterday.</p> 
<p>Recalling the evening he had spent with the Korchagins, a wealthy and aristocratic family, whose daughter every one expected he would marry, he sighed, and, throwing away the end of his cigarette, was going to take another out of the silver case; but, changing his mind, he resolutely raised his solid frame, and, putting down his smooth, white legs, stepped into his slippers, threw his silk dressing gown over his broad shoulders, and passed into his dressing-room, walking heavily and quickly. There he carefully cleaned his teeth, many of which were filled, with tooth powder, and rinsed his mouth with scented elixir. After that he washed his hands with perfumed soap, cleaned his long nails with particular care, then, from a tap fixed to his marble washstand, he let a spray of cold water run over his face and stout neck. Having finished this part of the business, he went into a third room, where a shower bath stood ready for him. Having refreshed his full, white, muscular body, and dried it with a rough bath sheet, he put on his fine undergarments and his boots, and sat down before the glass to brush his black beard and his curly hair, that had begun to get thin above the forehead. Everything he used, everything belonging to his toilet, his linen, his clothes, boots, necktie, pin, studs, was of the best quality, very quiet, simple, durable and costly.</p> 
<p>Nekhludoff dressed leisurely, and went into the dining-room. A table, which looked very imposing with its four legs carved in the shape of lions' paws, and a huge side-board to match, stood in the oblong room, the floor of which had been polished by three men the day before. On the table, which was covered with a fine, starched cloth, stood a silver coffeepot full of aromatic coffee, a sugar basin, a jug of fresh cream, and a bread basket filled with fresh rolls, rusks, and biscuits; and beside the plate lay the last number of the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, a newspaper, and several letters.</p> 
<p>Nekhludoff was just going to open his letters, when a stout, middle-aged woman in mourning, a lace cap covering the widening parting of her hair, glided into the room. This was Agraphena Petrovna, formerly lady's maid to Nekhludoff's mother. Her mistress had died quite recently in this very house, and she remained with the son as his housekeeper. Agraphena Petrovna had spent nearly ten years, at different times, abroad with Nekhludoff's mother, and had the appearance and manners of a lady. She had lived with the Nekhludoffs from the time she was a child, and had known Dmitri Ivanovitch at the time when he was still little Mitinka.</p> 
<p>"Good-morning, Dmitri Ivanovitch."</p> 
<p>"Good-morning, Agraphena Petrovna. What is it you want?" Nekhludoff asked.</p> 
<p>"A letter from the princess; either from the mother or the daughter. The maid brought it some time ago, and is waiting in my room," answered Agraphena Petrovna, handing him the letter with a significant smile.</p> 
<p>"All right! Directly!" said Nekhludoff, taking the letter and frowning as he noticed Agraphena Petrovna's smile.</p> 
<p>That smile meant that the letter was from the younger Princess Korchagin, whom Agraphena Petrovna expected him to marry. This supposition of hers annoyed Nekhludoff.</p> 
<p>"Then I'll tell her to wait?" and Agraphena Petrovna took a crumb brush which was not in its place, put it away, and sailed out of the room.</p> 
<p>Nekhludoff opened the perfumed note, and began reading it.</p> 
<p>The note was written on a sheet of thick grey paper, with rough edges; the writing looked English. It said:</p> 
<p>Having assumed the task of acting as your memory, I take the liberty of reminding you that on this the 28th day of April you have to appear at the Law Courts, as juryman, and, in consequence, can on no account accompany us and Kolosoff to the picture gallery, as, with your habitual flightiness, you promised yesterday; _a moins que vous ne soyez dispose a payer la cour d'assise les 300 roubles d'amende que vous vous refusez pour votre cheval,_ for not appearing in time. I remembered it last night after you were gone, so do not forget.</p> 
<p>Princess M. Korchagin.</p> 
<p>On the other side was a postscript.</p> 
<p>_Maman vous fait dire que votre convert vous attendra jusqu'a la nuit. Venez absolument a quelle heure que cela soit._</p> 
<p>M. K.</p> 
<p>Nekhludoff made a grimace. This note was a continuation of that skilful manoeuvring which the Princess Korchagin had already practised for two months in order to bind him closer and closer with invisible threads. And yet, beside the usual hesitation of men past their youth to marry unless they are very much in love, Nekhludoff had very good reasons why, even if he did make up his mind to it, he could not propose at once. It was not that ten years previously he had betrayed and forsaken Maslova; he had quite forgotten that, and he would not have considered it a reason for not marrying. No! The reason was that he had a liaison with a married woman, and, though he considered it broken off, she did not.</p> 
<p>Nekhludoff was rather shy with women, and his very shyness awakened in this married woman, the unprincipled wife of the marechal de noblesse of a district where Nekhludoff was present at an election, the desire of vanquishing him. This woman drew him into an intimacy which entangled him more and more, while it daily became more distasteful to him. Having succumbed to the temptation, Nekhludoff felt guilty, and had not the courage to break the tie without her consent. And this was the reason he did not feel at liberty to propose to Korchagin even if he had wished to do so. Among the letters on the table was one from this woman's husband. Seeing his writing and the postmark, Nekhludoff flushed, and felt his energies awakening, as they always did when he was facing any kind of danger.</p> 
<p>But his excitement passed at once. The marechal do noblesse, of the district in which his largest estate lay, wrote only to let Nekhludoff know that there was to be a special meeting towards the end of May, and that Nekhludoff was to be sure and come to "_donner un coup d'epaule_," at the important debates concerning the schools and the roads, as a strong opposition by the reactionary party was expected.</p> 
<p>The marechal was a liberal, and was quite engrossed in this fight, not even noticing the misfortune that had befallen him.</p> 
<p>Nekhludoff remembered the dreadful moments he had lived through; once when he thought that the husband had found him out and was going to challenge him, and he was making up his mind to fire into the air; also the terrible scene he had with her when she ran out into the park, and in her excitement tried to drown herself in the pond.</p> 
<p>"Well, I cannot go now, and can do nothing until I get a reply from her," thought Nekhludoff. A week ago he had written her a decisive letter, in which he acknowledged his guilt, and his readiness to atone for it; but at the same time he pronounced their relations to be at an end, for her own good, as he expressed it. To this letter he had as yet received no answer. This might prove a good sign, for if she did not agree to break off their relations, she would have written at once, or even come herself, as she had done before. Nekhludoff had heard that there was some officer who was paying her marked attention, and this tormented him by awakening jealousy, and at the same time encouraged him with the hope of escape from the deception that was oppressing him.</p> 
<p>The other letter was from his steward. The steward wrote to tell him that a visit to his estates was necessary in order to enter into possession, and also to decide about the further management of his lands; whether it was to continue in the same way as when his mother was alive, or whether, as he had represented to the late lamented princess, and now advised the young prince, they had not better increase their stock and farm all the land now rented by the peasants themselves. The steward wrote that this would be a far more profitable way of managing the property; at the same time, he apologised for not having forwarded the 3,000 roubles income due on the 1st. This money would he sent on by the next mail. The reason for the delay was that he could not get the money out of the peasants, who had grown so untrustworthy that he had to appeal to the authorities. This letter was partly disagreeable, and partly pleasant. It was pleasant to feel that he had power over so large a property, and yet disagreeable, because Nekhludoff had been an enthusiastic admirer of Henry George and Herbert Spencer. Being himself heir to a large property, he was especially struck by the position taken up by Spencer in Social Statics, that justice forbids private landholding, and with the straightforward resoluteness of his age, had not merely spoken to prove that land could not be looked upon as private property, and written essays on that subject at the university, but had acted up to his convictions, and, considering it wrong to hold landed property, had given the small piece of land he had inherited from his father to the peasants. Inheriting his mother's large estates, and thus becoming a landed proprietor, he had to choose one of two things: either to give up his property, as he had given up his father's land ten years before, or silently to confess that all his former ideas were mistaken and false.</p> 
<p>He could not choose the former because he had no means but the landed estates (he did not care to serve); moreover, he had formed luxurious habits which he could not easily give up. Besides, he had no longer the same inducements; his strong convictions, the resoluteness of youth, and the ambitious desire to do something unusual were gone. As to the second course, that of denying those clear and unanswerable proofs of the injustice of landholding, which he had drawn from Spencer's Social Statics, and the brilliant corroboration of which he had at a later period found in the works of Henry George, such a course was impossible to him.</p> 
<p>当玛丝洛娃在士兵押送下走了许多路，筋疲力尽，好容易才走到州法院大厦时，她两个养母的侄儿，当年诱奸她的德米特里·伊凡内奇·聂赫留朵夫公爵正躺在高高的弹簧床上，床上铺着鸭绒垫褥，被单被揉得很皱。他穿着一件前襟皱裥熨得笔挺的洁净荷兰细麻布睡衣，敞开领子，吸着香烟。他目光呆滞地瞪着前方，想着今天有什么事要做，昨天发生过什么事。</p> 
<p>昨天他在有钱有势的柯察金家度过一个黄昏。大家都认为他应该同他们家的小姐结婚。他想起昨晚的事，叹了一口气，丢掉手里的烟蒂，想从银烟盒里再取出一支烟，可是忽然改变主意，从床上挂下两条光溜溜的白腿，用脚找到拖鞋。他拿起一件绸晨衣往胖胖的肩膀上一披，迈着沉重的步子，急速走到卧室旁的盥洗室里。盥洗室里充满甘香酒剂、花露水、发蜡和香水的香味。他在那里用特等牙粉刷他那口补过多处的牙齿，用香喷喷的漱口药水漱口。然后上上下下擦洗身子，再用几块不同的毛巾擦干。他拿香皂洗手，用刷子仔细刷净长指甲，在巨大的大理石洗脸盆里洗了脸和肥胖的脖子，然后走到卧室旁的第三间屋里，那里已为他准备好了淋浴。他用凉水冲洗丰满白净、肌肉累累的身子，拿软毛巾擦干，穿上熨得笔挺的洁净衬衫和擦得象镜子一样光亮的皮鞋，坐到梳妆台前，用两把刷子梳理他那鬈曲的黑胡子和头顶前面已变得稀疏的鬈发。</p> 
<p>凡是他使用的东西，衬衫、外衣、皮鞋、领带、别针、袖扣，样样都是最贵重最讲究的，都很高雅，大方，坚固，名贵。</p> 
<p>聂赫留朵夫从好多领带和胸针中随手取了一条领带和一枚胸针（以前他对挑选领带和胸针很感兴趣，现在却毫不在意），又从椅子上拿起刷净的衣服穿好。这下子他虽算不上精神抖擞，却也浑身上下整洁芳香。他走进长方形饭厅。饭厅里的镶木地板昨天已由三个农民擦得锯光闪亮，上面摆着麻栎大酒台和一张活动大餐桌，桌腿雕成张开的狮爪，很有气派。桌上铺一块浆得笔挺、绣有巨大花体字母拼成的家徽的薄桌布，上面放着装有香气扑鼻的咖啡的银咖啡壶、银糖缸、盛有煮沸过的奶油的银壶和装满新鲜白面包、面包干和饼干的篮子。食具旁放着刚收到的信件、报纸和一本新出的法文杂志《两个世界》①。聂赫留朵夫刚要拆信，从通向走廊的门里忽然悄悄地进来一个肥胖的老妇人。她身穿丧服，头上扎着花边头带，把她那宽阔的头路都遮住了。她叫阿格拉斐娜，原是聂赫留朵夫母亲的侍女。前不久母亲在这个房子里去世，她就留下担任少爷的女管家。</p>

<p>①一八二九年起在巴黎印行的文艺和政论法语杂志，在俄国知识分子中间流行很广。这里原文为法语。以下原文凡用法语的，一律排仿宋体，不再一一作注。</p> 
<p>阿格拉斐娜跟随聂赫留朵夫母亲前后在国外待了十年，很有点贵妇人的风度和气派。她从小就生活在聂赫留朵夫家，在德米特里·伊凡内奇还叫小名米金卡的时候就知道他了。</p> 
<p>“您早，德米特里·伊凡内奇！”</p> 
<p>“您好，阿格拉斐娜！有什么新鲜事儿啊？”聂赫留朵夫戏谑地问。</p> 
<p>“有一封信，也不知是公爵夫人写来的，还是公爵小姐写来的，她们家的女佣人送来有好半天了，现在她还在我屋里等着呢，”阿格拉斐娜说着把信交给聂赫留朵夫，脸上现出会心的微笑。</p> 
<p>“好，等一下，”聂赫留朵夫接过信说，察觉阿格拉斐娜脸上的笑意，不由得皱起眉头。</p> 
<p>阿格拉斐娜的笑容表示，信是柯察金公爵小姐写来的。她以为聂赫留朵夫已准备同她结婚。阿格拉斐娜笑容的含义却使聂赫留朵夫不快。</p> 
<p>“那我去叫她再等一下，”阿格拉斐娜拿起那把放错地方的扫面包屑小刷子，将它放回老地方，悄悄地走出饭厅。</p> 
<p>聂赫留朵夫拆开阿格拉斐娜交给他的那封香气扑鼻的信，抽出一张曲边的灰色厚信纸，看见上面的字迹尖细而稀疏，读了起来：</p> 
<p>“我既已承担责任，把您的事随时提醒您，现在就通知您，今天四月二十八日您应该出庭陪审，因此您不能照您一贯的轻率作风，如昨天所答应的那样，陪我们和柯洛索夫去观看画展，除非您情愿向州法院缴纳三百卢布罚金，相当于您舍不得买那匹马的数目，为的是您没有准时出庭。昨天您一走，我就记起这件事。请您务必不要忘记。</p> 
<p>玛·柯察金公爵小姐。”</p> 
<p>信纸背面又加了两句：</p> 
<p>“妈要我告诉您，为您准备的晚餐将等您到深夜。请您务必光临，迟早听便。</p> 
<p>玛·柯·”</p> 
<p>聂赫留朵夫皱起眉头。这封信是柯察金公爵小姐两个月来向他巧妙进攻的又一招，目的是要用无形的千丝万缕把他同自己拴得越来越紧。凡是年纪已不很轻、又不是在热恋中的男人，对结婚问题往往患得患失，犹豫不决。不过，除了这一点，聂赫留朵夫还有一个重大原因，使他就算拿定主意，也不能立刻去求婚。这原因并非他在十年前诱奸了卡秋莎又把她抛弃了。这件事他已经忘记得一干二净，即使想起来，也不会把它看作结婚的障碍。这原因是他同一个有夫之妇有过私情，虽然从他这方面来说，这种关系现在已经结束，但她却不认为已一刀两断。</p> 
<p>聂赫留朵夫见到女人很腼腆。正因为他腼腆，这个有夫之妇才想要征服他。这个女人是聂赫留朵夫参加选举的那个县的首席贵族的妻子。她终于把聂赫留朵夫引入彀中。聂赫留朵夫一天比一天迷恋她，同时又一天比一天嫌恶她。聂赫留朵夫起初经不住她的诱惑，后来又在她面前感到内疚，因此若不取得她的同意，就不能断绝这种关系。也就因为这个缘故，聂赫留朵夫认为即使他心里愿意，也无权向柯察金小姐求婚。</p> 
<p>桌上正好放着那个女人的丈夫的来信。聂赫留朵夫一看见他的笔迹和邮戳，就脸红耳赤，心惊肉跳。他每次面临危险，总有这样的感觉。不过，他的紧张是多余的：那个丈夫，聂赫留朵夫主要地产所在县的首席贵族，通知聂赫留朵夫说，五月底将召开地方自治会非常会议，他要求聂赫留朵夫务必出席，以便在讨论有关学校和马路等当前重大问题时支持他，因为估计将遭到反动派的坚决反对。</p> 
<p>首席贵族是个自由派，他和几个志同道合的人一起反对亚历山大三世①登位后逐渐抬头的反动势力，一心一意投入这场斗争，根本不知道家里出了不幸的变故。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>①俄国沙皇，一八八一——一八九四年在位，因他父亲被民意党人杀害，实行恐怖统治，怂恿反动势力抬头。</p> 
<p>聂赫留朵夫想起由于这个人而产生的种种烦恼。记得有一次他以为那女人的丈夫已知道这事，就做好同他决斗的准备，决斗时他将朝天开枪。还记得她跟他大闹过一场，她在绝望中奔往花园的池塘，想投水自尽，他连忙追了上去。“我现在不能到她那边去，在她没有答复我以前，我也不能采取任何措施，”聂赫留朵夫心里盘算着。一星期以前，他写了一封信给她，语气很坚决，承认自己有罪，不惜用任何方式赎罪，但认为为了她的幸福，他们的关系必须一刀两断。他现在就在等她的回信，但没有等到。没有回信多少也是个好兆头。她要是不同意断绝关系，早就该来信了，说不定还会象上次那样亲自赶来。聂赫留朵夫听说现在有个军官在追求她，这使他心里酸溜溜的，但同时又因为可以不再撒谎做假而感到高兴，并松了一口气。</p> 
<p>另一封信是经管他地产的总管写来的。总管在信里说，他聂赫留朵夫必须亲自回乡一次，以便办理遗产过户手续，同时就农业的经营方式作出决定：继续照公爵夫人在世时那样经营呢，还是采取他总管以前曾向公爵夫人提出，如今再向公爵少爷提出的办法，也就是增加农具，把租给农民的土地全部收回自己耕种。总管认为自己耕种要划算得多。此外，总管还表示歉意说，原定月初汇出的三千卢布得耽搁几天，这笔钱将随下一班邮车汇出。耽搁的原因是农民不肯缴租，他收不齐租金，只得求助于官府，强制农民缴纳。聂赫留朵夫收到这封信，又高兴又不高兴。高兴的是他意识到自己掌握了大量产业。不高兴的是他当年原是斯宾塞①的忠实信徒，而且身为大地主，对斯宾塞在《社会静力学》②中所提出的“正义不容许土地私有”这个论点特别折服。他出于青年人的正直和果断，不仅口头上拥护土地不该成为私有财产的观点，在大学里还就这个问题写过论文，而且真的曾把一小块土地（那块土地不属于他母亲所有，而是他从父亲名下直接继承来的）分给农民。他不愿违反自己的信念而占有土地。如今继承了母亲的遗产而成为大地主，他必须在两条道路中间选择一条：或者象十年前处理父亲遗下的两百俄亩土地那样，放弃他名下的产业；或者默认自己以前的全部想法都是荒谬的。</p> 
<p>第一条道路他不能走，因为除了土地他没有任何其他生活资料。他既不愿意做官，又不能放弃早已过惯的奢侈生活。再说，他也没有必要放弃这样的生活，因为年轻时的信仰、决心、虚荣和一鸣惊人的欲望，如今都没有了。至于第二条道路，要否定他从斯宾塞的《社会静力学》中汲取来、后来又从亨利·乔治③的著作里找到光辉论证的“土地私有不合理”这个论点，他可怎么也办不到。</p>
