<p>His conversation with the president and the fresh air quieted Nekhludoff a little. He now thought that the feelings experienced by him had been exaggerated by the unusual surroundings in which he had spent the whole of the morning, and by that wonderful and startling coincidence. Still, it was absolutely necessary to take some steps to lighten Maslova's fate, and to take them quickly. "Yes, at once! It will be best to find out here in the court where the advocate Fanarin or Mikishin lives." These were two well-known advocates whom Nekhludoff called to mind. He returned to the court, took off his overcoat, and went upstairs. In the first corridor he met Fanarin himself. He stopped him, and told him that he was just going to look him up on a matter of business.</p> 
<p>Fanarin knew Nekhludoff by sight and name, and said he would be very glad to be of service to him.</p> 
<p>"Though I am rather tired, still, if your business will not take very long, perhaps you might tell me what it is now. Will you step in here?" And he led Nekhludoff into a room, probably some judge's cabinet. They sat down by the table.</p> 
<p>"Well, and what is your business?"</p> 
<p>"First of all, I must ask you to keep the business private. I do not want it known that I take an interest in the affair."</p> 
<p>"Oh, that of course. Well?"</p> 
<p>"I was on the jury to-day, and we have condemned a woman to Siberia, an innocent woman. This bothers me very much." Nekhludoff, to his own surprise, blushed and became confused. Fanarin glanced at him rapidly, and looked down again, listening.</p> 
<p>"Well?"</p> 
<p>"We have condemned a woman, and I should like to appeal to a higher court."</p> 
<p>"To the Senate, you mean," said Fanarin, correcting him.</p> 
<p>"Yes, and I should like to ask you to take the case in hand." Nekhludoff wanted to get the most difficult part over, and added, "I shall take the costs of the case on myself, whatever they may be."</p> 
<p>"Oh, we shall settle all that," said the advocate, smiling with condescension at Nekhludoff's inexperience in these matters. "What is the case?"</p> 
<p>Nekhludoff stated what had happened.</p> 
<p>"All right. I shall look the case through to-morrow or the day after--no--better on Thursday. If you will come to me at six o'clock I will give you an answer. Well, and now let us go; I have to make a few inquiries here."</p> 
<p>Nekhludoff took leave of him and went out. This talk with the advocate, and the fact that he had taken measures for Maslova's defence, quieted him still further. He went out into the street. The weather was beautiful, and he joyfully drew in a long breath of spring air. He was at once surrounded by isvostchiks offering their services, but he went on foot. A whole swarm of pictures and memories of Katusha and his conduct to her began whirling in his brain, and he felt depressed and everything appeared gloomy. "No, I shall consider all this later on; I must now get rid of all these disagreeable impressions," he thought to himself.</p> 
<p>He remembered the Korchagin's dinner and looked at his watch. It was not yet too late to get there in time. He heard the ring of a passing tramcar, ran to catch it, and jumped on. He jumped off again when they got to the market-place, took a good isvostchik, and ten minutes later was at the entrance of the Korchagins' big house.</p> 
<p>同庭长谈了话，又呼吸到清新的空气，聂赫留朵夫心里稍微平静了些。他想，刚才他所以感到特别难受，是由于在那么不习惯的环境里度过了整整一个上午。</p> 
<p>“这事真是万万没料到，太可怕了！一定要千方百计减轻她的苦难，而且要赶快动手。立刻就动手。对，我得在这里打听一下，法纳林或者米基兴住在什么地方。”他想起了两位名律师。</p> 
<p>聂赫留朵夫返身回到法院，脱下大衣，走上楼去。他在第一条走廊里就遇见了法纳林。他拦住律师，说有事要同他商量。法纳林认识他，知道他的姓名，表示极愿意为他效劳。</p> 
<p>“虽然我很累了……但要是时间不长，您就给我讲讲您的事吧。咱们到这里来。”</p> 
<p>法纳林把聂赫留朵夫带到一个房间里，多半是哪个法官的办公室。他们在桌旁坐下。</p> 
<p>“那么，是怎么一回事？”</p> 
<p>“首先我要请求您，”聂赫留朵夫说，“不要让任何人知道我在过问这个案件。”</p> 
<p>“噢，这是理所当然的。那么……”</p> 
<p>“我今天做了一次陪审员。我们把一个女人，一个无罪的女人判了服苦役。这件事使我很难过。”</p> 
<p>聂赫留朵夫自己也没想到，竟然脸红耳赤，说不下去了。</p> 
<p>法纳林瞥了他一眼，又垂下眼睛听着。</p> 
<p>“哦，”他只应了一声。</p> 
<p>“我们把一个无罪的女人判成有罪。我希望撤销原判，把这个案子转到最高法院重判。”</p> 
<p>“转到枢密院去，”法纳林纠正他说。</p> 
<p>“对了，我就是来求您办这件事的。”</p> 
<p>聂赫留朵夫想赶快说出最难出口的话，因此立刻就接着说：</p> 
<p>“至于办这个案子的酬报和费用，不管多少，全部由我负担，”他红着脸说。</p> 
<p>“哦，这事我们以后好商量，”律师说。他看到聂赫留朵夫的幼稚，宽厚地微笑着。</p> 
<p>“那么问题究竟出在哪里呢？”</p> 
<p>聂赫留朵夫把事情的始末讲了一遍。</p> 
<p>“好吧，这事我明天就来办，要研究一下案情。后天，不，礼拜四晚上六点钟您到我家来，我给您答复。这样好吗？那咱们走吧，我还有些事，要在这里查一下。”</p> 
<p>聂赫留朵夫向他告辞，走了出去。</p> 
<p>他同律师谈过话，又采取了措施替玛丝洛娃辩护，觉得心里平静多了。他走到法院外面。天气晴朗，他舒畅地吸了一大口春天的空气。马车夫纷纷向他兜揽生意，可是他情愿步行。有关卡秋莎以及他对她行为的种种思绪和回忆，顿时在他头脑里翻腾起来。他又变得垂头丧气，心情郁闷了。“不行，这事以后再说吧，”他自言自语，“现在我得抛开这些烦恼，去散散心。”</p> 
<p>他想起了柯察金家的午餐，看了看表。时间不算晚，还赶得上。正好有一辆公共马车叮噹响着驶过来。他跑了几步，跳上马车。他在广场上下了车，另外雇了一辆漂亮的马车，过了十分钟，就来到柯察金家大门口。</p>
