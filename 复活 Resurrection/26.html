<p>"Please to walk in, your excellency," said the friendly, fat doorkeeper of the Korchagins' big house, opening the door, which moved noiselessly on its patent English hinges; "you are expected. They are at dinner. My orders were to admit only you." The doorkeeper went as far as the staircase and rang.</p> 
<p>"Are there any strangers?" asked Nekhludoff, taking off his overcoat.</p> 
<p>"Mr. Kolosoff and Michael Sergeivitch only, besides the family."</p> 
<p>A very handsome footman with whiskers, in a swallow-tail coat and white gloves, looked down from the landing.</p> 
<p>"Please to walk up, your excellency," he said. "You are expected."</p> 
<p>Nekhludoff went up and passed through the splendid large dancing-room, which he knew so well, into the dining-room. There the whole Korchagin family--except the mother, Sophia Vasilievna, who never left her cabinet--were sitting round the table. At the head of the table sat old Korchagin; on his left the doctor, and on his right, a visitor, Ivan Ivanovitch Kolosoff, a former Marechal de Noblesse, now a bank director, Korchagin's friend and a Liberal. Next on the left side sat Miss Rayner, the governess of Missy's little sister, and the four-year-old girl herself. Opposite them, Missy's brother, Petia, the only son of the Korchagins, a public-school boy of the Sixth Class. It was because of his examinations that the whole family were still in town. Next to him sat a University student who was coaching him, and Missy's cousin, Michael Sergeivitch Telegin, generally called Misha; opposite him, Katerina Alexeevna, a 40-year-old maiden lady, a Slavophil; and at the foot of the table sat Missy herself, with an empty place by her side.</p> 
<p>"Ah! that's right! Sit down. We are still at the fish," said old Korchagin with difficulty, chewing carefully with his false teeth, and lifting his bloodshot eyes (which had no visible lids to them) to Nekhludoff.</p> 
<p>"Stephen!" he said, with his mouth full, addressing the stout, dignified butler, and pointing with his eyes to the empty place. Though Nekhludoff knew Korchagin very well, and had often seen him at dinner, to-day this red face with the sensual smacking lips, the fat neck above the napkin stuck into his waistcoat, and the whole over-fed military figure, struck him very disagreeably. Then Nekhludoff remembered, without wishing to, what he knew of the cruelty of this man, who, when in command, used to have men flogged, and even hanged, without rhyme or reason, simply because he was rich and had no need to curry favour.</p> 
<p>"Immediately, your excellency," said Stephen, getting a large soup ladle out of the sideboard, which was decorated with a number of silver vases. He made a sign with his head to the handsome footman, who began at once to arrange the untouched knives and forks and the napkin, elaborately folded with the embroidered family crest uppermost, in front of the empty place next to Missy. Nekhludoff went round shaking hands with every one, and all, except old Korchagin and the ladies, rose when he approached. And this walk round the table, this shaking the hands of people, with many of whom he never talked, seemed unpleasant and odd. He excused himself for being late, and was about to sit down between Missy and Katerina Alexeevna, but old Korchagin insisted that if he would not take a glass of vodka he should at least take a bit of something to whet his appetite, at the side table, on which stood small dishes of lobster, caviare, cheese, and salt herrings. Nekhludoff did not know how hungry he was until he began to eat, and then, having taken some bread and cheese, he went on eating eagerly.</p> 
<p>"Well, have you succeeded in undermining the basis of society?" asked Kolosoff, ironically quoting an expression used by a retrograde newspaper in attacking trial by jury. "Acquitted the culprits and condemned the innocent, have you?"</p> 
<p>"Undermining the basis--undermining the basis," repeated Prince Korchagin, laughing. He had a firm faith in the wisdom and learning of his chosen friend and companion.</p> 
<p>At the risk of seeming rude, Nekhludoff left Kolosoff's question unanswered, and sitting down to his steaming soup, went on eating.</p> 
<p>"Do let him eat," said Missy, with a smile. The pronoun him she used as a reminder of her intimacy with Nekhludoff. Kolosoff went on in a loud voice and lively manner to give the contents of the article against trial by jury which had aroused his indignation. Missy's cousin, Michael Sergeivitch, endorsed all his statements, and related the contents of another article in the same paper. Missy was, as usual, very distinguee, and well, unobtrusively well, dressed.</p> 
<p>"You must be terribly tired," she said, after waiting until Nekhludoff had swallowed what was in his mouth.</p> 
<p>"Not particularly. And you? Have you been to look at the pictures?" he asked.</p> 
<p>"No, we put that off. We have been playing tennis at the Salamatoffs'. It is quite true, Mr. Crooks plays remarkably well."</p> 
<p>Nekhludoff had come here in order to distract his thoughts, for he used to like being in this house, both because its refined luxury had a pleasant effect on him and because of the atmosphere of tender flattery that unobtrusively surrounded him. But to-day everything in the house was repulsive to him--everything: beginning with the doorkeeper, the broad staircase, the flowers, the footman, the table decorations, up to Missy herself, who to-day seemed unattractive and affected. Kolosoff's self-assured, trivial tone of liberalism was unpleasant, as was also the sensual, self-satisfied, bull-like appearance of old Korchagin, and the French phrases of Katerina Alexeevna, the Slavophil. The constrained looks of the governess and the student were unpleasant, too, but most unpleasant of all was the pronoun _him_ that Missy had used. Nekhludoff had long been wavering between two ways of regarding Missy; sometimes he looked at her as if by moonlight, and could see in her nothing but what was beautiful, fresh, pretty, clever and natural; then suddenly, as if the bright sun shone on her, he saw her defects and could not help seeing them. This was such a day for him. To-day he saw all the wrinkles of her face, knew which of her teeth were false, saw the way her hair was crimped, the sharpness of her elbows, and, above all, how large her thumb-nail was and how like her father's.</p> 
<p>"Tennis is a dull game," said Kolosoff; "we used to play lapta when we were children. That was much more amusing."</p> 
<p>"Oh, no, you never tried it; it's awfully interesting," said Missy, laying, it seemed to Nekhludoff, a very affected stress on the word "awfully." Then a dispute arose in which Michael Sergeivitch, Katerina Alexeevna and all the others took part, except the governess, the student and the children, who sat silent and wearied.</p> 
<p>"Oh, these everlasting disputes!" said old Korchagin, laughing, and he pulled the napkin out of his waistcoat, noisily pushed back his chair, which the footman instantly caught hold of, and left the table.</p> 
<p>Everybody rose after him, and went up to another table on which stood glasses of scented water. They rinsed their mouths, then resumed the conversation, interesting to no one.</p> 
<p>"Don't you think so?" said Missy to Nekhludoff, calling for a confirmation of the statement that nothing shows up a man's character like a game. She noticed that preoccupied and, as it seemed to her, dissatisfied look which she feared, and she wanted to find out what had caused it.</p> 
<p>"Really, I can't tell; I have never thought about it," Nekhludoff answered.</p> 
<p>"Will you come to mamma?" asked Missy.</p> 
<p>"Yes, yes," he said, in a tone which plainly proved that he did not want to go, and took out a cigarette.</p> 
<p>She looked at him in silence, with a questioning look, and he felt ashamed. "To come into a house and give the people the dumps," he thought about himself; then, trying to be amiable, said that he would go with pleasure if the princess would admit him.</p> 
<p>"Oh, yes! Mamma will be pleased. You may smoke there; and Ivan Ivanovitch is also there."</p> 
<p>The mistress of the house, Princess Sophia Vasilievna, was a recumbent lady. It was the eighth year that, when visitors were present, she lay in lace and ribbons, surrounded with velvet, gilding, ivory, bronze, lacquer and flowers, never going out, and only, as she put it, receiving intimate friends, i.e., those who according to her idea stood out from the common herd.</p> 
<p>Nekhludoff was admitted into the number of these friends because he was considered clever, because his mother had been an intimate friend of the family, and because it was desirable that Missy should marry him.</p> 
<p>Sophia Vasilievna's room lay beyond the large and the small drawing-rooms. In the large drawing-room, Missy, who was in front of Nekhludoff, stopped resolutely, and taking hold of the back of a small green chair, faced him.</p> 
<p>Missy was very anxious to get married, and as he was a suitable match and she also liked him, she had accustomed herself to the thought that he should be hers (not she his). To lose him would be very mortifying. She now began talking to him in order to get him to explain his intentions.</p> 
<p>"I see something has happened," she said. "Tell me, what is the matter with you?"</p> 
<p>He remembered the meeting in the law court, and frowned and blushed.</p> 
<p>"Yes, something has happened," he said, wishing to be truthful; "a very unusual and serious event."</p> 
<p>"What is it, then? Can you not tell me what it is?" She was pursuing her aim with that unconscious yet obstinate cunning often observable in the mentally diseased.</p> 
<p>"Not now. Please do not ask me to tell you. I have not yet had time fully to consider it," and he blushed still more.</p> 
<p>"And so you will not tell me?" A muscle twitched in her face and she pushed back the chair she was holding. "Well then, come!" She shook her head as if to expel useless thoughts, and, faster than usual, went on in front of him.</p> 
<p>He fancied that her mouth was unnaturally compressed in order to keep back the tears. He was ashamed of having hurt her, and yet he knew that the least weakness on his part would mean disaster, i.e., would bind him to her. And to-day he feared this more than anything, and silently followed her to the princess's cabinet.</p> 
<p>“老爷，请进，都在等您呢，”柯察金家那个和蔼可亲的胖门房一面说，一面拉开装有英国饺链、开时没有声音的麻栎大门。“他们已经入席了，但关照过，您一到就请进。”</p> 
<p>门房走到楼梯口，拉了拉通到楼上的铃。</p> 
<p>“有客人吗？”聂赫留朵夫一面脱衣服，一面问。“柯洛索夫先生，还有米哈伊尔少爷，其余都是家里人，”</p> 
<p>门房回答。</p> 
<p>一个穿燕尾服、戴白手套的漂亮侍仆从楼梯顶上往下看了看。</p> 
<p>“您请，老爷，”他说。“关照过了，请您上来。”</p> 
<p>聂赫留朵夫上了楼，穿过熟识的华丽宽敞的大客厅，走进餐厅。餐厅里，一家人都已围坐在饭桌旁，除了母亲沙斐雅公爵夫人之外。她是从来不出房门一步的。饭桌上首坐着柯察金老头；他的左边坐着医生，右边坐着客人柯洛索夫，柯洛索夫当过省首席贵族，如今是银行董事，又是柯察金的具有自由派思想的朋友；左边再下去是米西的小妹的家庭教师蓝德小姐，还有就是才四岁的小妹；她们对面，右边再下去是米西的哥哥，柯察金的独生子，六年级中学生彼嘉，一家人就是因为等他考试而留在城里没有走；彼嘉旁边是那个担任补习教师的大学生；左边再下去是斯拉夫派信徒，四十岁的老姑娘卡吉琳娜；她对面是米哈伊尔，或者叫米沙，他是米西的表哥。饭桌下首是米西本人，她旁边放着一份没有动用过的餐具。</p> 
<p>“哦，这就好了。请坐，我们刚开始吃鱼，”柯察金老头费力地用假牙小心咀嚼着，说道，抬起看不出眼皮的充血眼睛望望聂赫留朵夫。“斯吉邦，”他嘴里塞满食物，用眼睛示意那副没有用过的餐具，转身对那个神情庄重的餐厅胖侍仆说。</p> 
<p>聂赫留朵夫同柯察金老头虽然很熟，同他一起吃过多次饭，可是今天聂赫留朵夫不知怎的特别讨厌他那张红脸、他那被背心上掖着的餐巾衬托着的两片吃得津津有味的贪婪嘴唇、他那粗大的脖子，尤其是他那吃得大腹便便的将军式身躯。聂赫留朵夫不由得想起这个老头的残酷。他在任地区长官的时候，常常无缘无故把人鞭笞一顿，甚至把人绞死，其实他既有钱又有势，根本没有必要这样来邀功请赏。</p> 
<p>“马上就来，老爷，”斯吉邦一面说，一面从摆满银餐具的酒橱里拿出一个大汤勺，又向那个蓄络腮胡子的漂亮侍仆点点头。那个侍仆就把米西旁边那副没有用过的餐具摆摆正。那副餐具上原来盖着一块折叠得整整齐齐的浆过的餐巾，餐巾上面绣着家徽。</p> 
<p>聂赫留朵夫绕饭桌一周，同大家一一握手。他走过的时候，除了柯察金老头和太太小姐们，一个个都站起来。聂赫留朵夫跟多数人虽然从没交谈过，但还是一一握手问好。这种应酬他今天觉得特别嫌恶，特别无聊。他为自己的迟到表示了歉意，正想在米西和卡吉琳娜之间的空位上坐下，但柯察金老头要他即使不喝酒，也先到那张摆着龙虾、鱼子酱、干酪和咸青鱼的冷菜桌上去吃一点。聂赫留朵夫自己也没想到肚子那么饿，一吃干酪面包就放不下，竟狼吞虎咽地吃起来。</p> 
<p>“哦，怎么样，把是非彻底颠倒了？”柯洛索夫借用反动报纸抨击陪审制度的用语挖苦说。“把有罪的判成无罪，把无罪的判成有罪，是不是？”</p> 
<p>“把是非彻底颠倒了……把是非彻底颠倒了……”老公爵笑着连声说，他无限信任这位自由派同志和朋友的博学多才。</p> 
<p>聂赫留朵夫不顾是否失礼，没有答理柯洛索夫，却坐到一盘刚端上来的热气腾腾的汤旁边，继续吃着。</p> 
<p>“您让他先吃吧，”米西笑眯眯地说，用他这个代词表示他们之间的亲密关系。</p> 
<p>这时柯洛索夫情绪激动，大声讲到那篇使他生气的反对陪审制的文章。公爵的表侄米哈伊尔附和他的看法，介绍了那家报纸另一篇文章的内容。</p> 
<p>米西打扮得象平时一样雅致，她衣着讲究，但讲究得并不刺眼。</p> 
<p>“您一定累坏了，饿坏了，是不是？”她等聂赫留朵夫咽下食物，说。</p> 
<p>“不，还好。那么您呢？去看过画展吗？”聂赫留朵夫问。</p> 
<p>“不，我们改期了。我们在萨拉玛托夫家打草地网球①。说实在的，密丝脱克鲁克斯打得真漂亮。”</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>①原文是英语。</p> 
<p>聂赫留朵夫到这里来是为了散散心。平时他在这座房子里总感到很愉快，不仅因为这种豪华的气派使他觉得舒服，而且周围那种亲切奉承的气氛使他高兴。今天呢，说也奇怪，这座房子里的一切，从门房、宽阔的楼梯、鲜花、侍仆、桌上的摆设起，直到米西本人，什么都使他嫌恶。他觉得米西今天并不可爱，装腔作势，很不自然。他讨厌柯洛索夫那种妄自尊大的自由派论调，讨厌柯察金老头那种得意扬扬的好色的公牛般身材，讨厌斯拉夫派信徒卡吉琳娜的满口法国话，讨厌家庭女教师和补习教师那种拘谨的样子，尤其讨厌米西说到他时单用代词他……聂赫留朵夫对米西的态度常常摇摆不定：有时他仿佛眯细眼睛或者在月光底下瞅她，看到了她身上的种种优点，他觉得她又娇嫩，又美丽，又聪明，又大方……有时他仿佛在灿烂的阳光下瞧她，这样就不能不看到她身上的种种缺点。今天对他来说就是这样的日子。今天他看见她脸上的每道皱纹，看见她头发蓬乱，看见她的臂肘尖得难看，尤其是看见她大拇指上宽大的指甲，简直同她父亲的手指甲一模一样。</p> 
<p>“那玩意儿没意思，”柯洛索夫谈到网球说，“我们小时候玩的棒球要有趣多了。”</p> 
<p>“不，您没有尝到那个乐趣。那种球好玩极了，”米西不同意他的话，但聂赫留朵夫觉得她说好玩极了几个字有点装腔作势，怪不自然的。</p> 
<p>于是展开了一场争论，米哈伊尔和卡吉琳娜也都参加进去。只有家庭女教师、补习教师和孩子们没作声，显然不感兴趣。</p> 
<p>“老是吵嘴！”柯察金老头哈哈大笑，从背心上拉下餐巾，哗啦啦地推开椅子，从桌旁站起来。仆人把他的椅子接过去。其余的人也跟着他纷纷起立，走到放有漱口杯和香喷喷温水的小桌旁，漱了一下口，继续那种谁也不感兴趣的谈话。</p> 
<p>“您说是吗？”米西转身对聂赫留朵夫说，要他赞成她的意见，她认为，人的性格再没有比在运动中暴露得更清楚的了。可她在他脸上却看到那种心事重重而且——她觉得——</p> 
<p>愤愤不平的神色。她感到害怕，很想知道那是什么缘故。</p> 
<p>“说实话，我不知道。这问题我从来没有考虑过，”聂赫留朵夫回答。</p> 
<p>“您去看看妈妈，好吗？”米西问。</p> 
<p>“好，好，”他一面说，一面拿出香烟，但他的口气分明表示他不愿意去。</p> 
<p>她不作声，困惑地对他瞧瞧。他感到有点不好意思。“不错，既然来看人家，可不能弄得人家扫兴啊，”他暗自想，就竭力做出亲切的样子说，要是公爵夫人肯接见，他是高兴去的。</p> 
<p>“当然，当然，您去，妈妈会高兴的。烟到那边也可以抽。</p> 
<p>伊凡·伊凡内奇也在那里。”</p> 
<p>这家的女主人沙斐雅公爵夫人长期卧病在床。她躺着会客已经有八年了，身上穿的满是花边、缎带和丝绒，周围都是镀金、象牙、青铜摆件和漆器，还有各种花草。她从不出门，一向只接见她所谓“自己的朋友”，其实就是她认为出类拔萃的人物。聂赫留朵夫属于这种被接见的“朋友”之列，因为她认为他是个聪明的年轻人，又因为他的母亲是他们家的老朋友，更因为米西如能嫁给他，那就更加称心了。</p> 
<p>沙斐雅公爵夫人的房间在大客厅和小客厅后面。米西走在聂赫留朵夫前面，但一走进大客厅，她就突然站住，双手扶着涂金椅子背，对他瞧了瞧。</p> 
<p>米西很想出嫁，而聂赫留朵夫是个好配偶。再说，她喜欢他，她惯于想：他是属于她的（不是她属于他，而是他属于她）。她还用精神病患者常用的那种无意而又固执的狡诈手法来达到目的。此刻她同他说话，就要他说出他的心事来。</p> 
<p>“我看出您遇到什么事了，”米西说。“您这是怎么了？”</p> 
<p>聂赫留朵夫想到他在法庭上见到了卡秋莎，就皱起眉头，脸涨得通红。</p> 
<p>“是的，遇到了事，”他说，想把今天的事老实说出来，“一件奇怪的、不寻常的大事。”</p> 
<p>“什么事啊？您不能告诉我吗？”</p> 
<p>“这会儿我不能。请您别问我。这件事我还来不及好好考虑，”聂赫留朵夫说着，脸涨得更红了。</p> 
<p>“您对我都不肯讲吗？”她脸上的肌肉跳动了一下，手里的椅子也挪了挪。</p> 
<p>“不，我不能，”他回答，觉得这样回答她，等于在回答自己，承认确实遇到了一件非同小可的事。</p> 
<p>“噢，那么我们走吧。”</p> 
<p>米西摇摇头，仿佛要甩掉不必要的想法，接着迈开异乎寻常的步子急急向前走去。</p> 
<p>聂赫留朵夫觉得她不自然地咬紧嘴唇，忍住眼泪。他弄得她伤心，他觉得又不好意思又难过，但他知道只要心一软，就会把自己毁掉，也就是说同她结合在一起，再也拆不开。而这是他现在最害怕的事。于是他就一言不发地同她一起来到公爵夫人屋里。</p>
