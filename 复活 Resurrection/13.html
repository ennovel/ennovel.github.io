<p>After that Nekhludoff did not see Katusha for more than three years. When he saw her again he had just been promoted to the rank of officer and was going to join his regiment. On the way he came to spend a few days with his aunts, being now a very different young man from the one who had spent the summer with them three years before. He then had been an honest, unselfish lad, ready to sacrifice himself for any good cause; now he was depraved and selfish, and thought only of his own enjoyment. Then God's world seemed a mystery which he tried enthusiastically and joyfully to solve; now everything in life seemed clear and simple, defined by the conditions of the life he was leading. Then he had felt the importance of, and had need of intercourse with, nature, and with those who had lived and thought and felt before him--philosophers and poets. What he now considered necessary and important were human institutions and intercourse with his comrades. Then women seemed mysterious and charming--charming by the very mystery that enveloped them; now the purpose of women, all women except those of his own family and the wives of his friends, was a very definite one: women were the best means towards an already experienced enjoyment. Then money was not needed, and he did not require even one-third of what his mother allowed him; but now this allowance of 1,500 roubles a month did not suffice, and he had already had some unpleasant talks about it with his mother.</p> 
<p>Then he had looked on his spirit as the I; now it was his healthy strong animal I that he looked upon as himself.</p> 
<p>And all this terrible change had come about because he had ceased to believe himself and had taken to believing others. This he had done because it was too difficult to live believing one's self; believing one's self, one had to decide every question not in favour of one's own animal life, which is always seeking for easy gratifications, but almost in every case against it. Believing others there was nothing to decide; everything had been decided already, and decided always in favour of the animal I and against the spiritual. Nor was this all. Believing in his own self he was always exposing himself to the censure of those around him; believing others he had their approval. So, when Nekhludoff had talked of the serious matters of life, of God, truth, riches, and poverty, all round him thought it out of place and even rather funny, and his mother and aunts called him, with kindly irony, notre cher philosophe. But when he read novels, told improper anecdotes, went to see funny vaudevilles in the French theatre and gaily repeated the jokes, everybody admired and encouraged him. When he considered it right to limit his needs, wore an old overcoat, took no wine, everybody thought it strange and looked upon it as a kind of showing off; but when he spent large sums on hunting, or on furnishing a peculiar and luxurious study for himself, everybody admired his taste and gave him expensive presents to encourage his hobby. While he kept pure and meant to remain so till he married his friends prayed for his health, and even his mother was not grieved but rather pleased when she found out that he had become a real man and had gained over some French woman from his friend. (As to the episode with Katusha, the princess could not without horror think that he might possibly have married her.) In the same way, when Nekhludoff came of age, and gave the small estate he had inherited from his father to the peasants because he considered the holding of private property in land wrong, this step filled his mother and relations with dismay and served as an excuse for making fun of him to all his relatives. He was continually told that these peasants, after they had received the land, got no richer, but, on the contrary, poorer, having opened three public-houses and left off doing any work. But when Nekhludoff entered the Guards and spent and gambled away so much with his aristocratic companions that Elena Ivanovna, his mother, had to draw on her capital, she was hardly pained, considering it quite natural and even good that wild oats should be sown at an early age and in good company, as her son was doing. At first Nekhludoff struggled, but all that he had considered good while he had faith in himself was considered bad by others, and what he had considered evil was looked upon as good by those among whom he lived, and the struggle grew too hard. And at last Nekhludoff gave in, i.e., left off believing himself and began believing others. At first this giving up of faith in himself was unpleasant, but it did not long continue to be so. At that time he acquired the habit of smoking, and drinking wine, and soon got over this unpleasant feeling and even felt great relief.</p> 
<p>Nekhludoff, with his passionate nature, gave himself thoroughly to the new way of life so approved of by all those around, and he entirely stifled the inner voice which demanded something different. This began after he moved to St. Petersburg, and reached its highest point when he entered the army.</p> 
<p>Military life in general depraves men. It places them in conditions of complete idleness, i.e., absence of all useful work; frees them of their common human duties, which it replaces by merely conventional ones to the honour of the regiment, the uniform, the flag; and, while giving them on the one hand absolute power over other men, also puts them into conditions of servile obedience to those of higher rank than themselves.</p> 
<p>But when, to the usual depraving influence of military service with its honours, uniforms, flags, its permitted violence and murder, there is added the depraving influence of riches and nearness to and intercourse with members of the Imperial family, as is the case in the chosen regiment of the Guards in which all the officers are rich and of good family, then this depraving influence creates in the men who succumb to it a perfect mania of selfishness. And this mania of selfishness attacked Nekhludoff from the moment he entered the army and began living in the way his companions lived. He had no occupation whatever except to dress in a uniform, splendidly made and well brushed by other people, and, with arms also made and cleaned and handed to him by others, ride to reviews on a fine horse which had been bred, broken in and fed by others. There, with other men like himself, he had to wave a sword, shoot off guns, and teach others to do the same. He had no other work, and the highly-placed persons, young and old, the Tsar and those near him, not only sanctioned his occupation but praised and thanked him for it.</p> 
<p>After this was done, it was thought important to eat, and particularly to drink, in officers' clubs or the salons of the best restaurants, squandering large sums of money, which came from some invisible source; then theatres, ballets, women, then again riding on horseback, waving of swords and shooting, and again the squandering of money, the wine, cards, and women. This kind of life acts on military men even more depravingly than on others, because if any other than a military man lead such a life he cannot help being ashamed of it in the depth of his heart. A military man is, on the contrary, proud of a life of this kind especially at war time, and Nekhludoff had entered the army just after war with the Turks had been declared. "We are prepared to sacrifice our lives at the wars, and therefore a gay, reckless life is not only pardonable, but absolutely necessary for us, and so we lead it."</p> 
<p>Such were Nekhludoff's confused thoughts at this period of his existence, and he felt all the time the delight of being free of the moral barriers he had formerly set himself. And the state he lived in was that of a chronic mania of selfishness. He was in this state when, after three years' absence, he came again to visit his aunts.</p> 
<p>从那时起，聂赫留朵夫整整三年没有同卡秋莎见面。直到三年后他升为军官，动身去部队，路过姑妈家，这才又见到了她。但同三年前的夏天住在她们家里时相比，他已换了个人了。</p> 
<p>那时他是个正派青年，富有自我牺牲精神，乐意为一切高尚事业献身；如今他可成了一个彻头彻尾的利己主义者，迷恋酒色，享乐成癖。那时，上帝创造的世界在他看来是个谜，他兴致勃勃地企图解开这个谜；现在呢，生活中的一切事情都简单明了，都是由他所处的生活环境安排的。那时，接触大自然，接触前人——在他以前生活、思想和感觉过的哲学家、诗人——是重要的；现在呢，重要的是社会制度和跟同事们的交际活动。那时，他觉得女人是神秘而迷人的，正因为神秘就更加迷人；现在呢，女人，除了亲人和朋友的妻子，她们的作用都很清楚：女人是他领略过的最好的玩乐用具。那时他不需要钱，母亲给他的钱连三分之一都花不掉，他可以放弃父亲名下的地产，分赠给他的佃户；现在呢，母亲按月给他一千五百卢布，他还不够用，为了钱他跟母亲拌过嘴。那时，他认为精神的生命才是真正的我；现在呢，他以为精力充沛的强壮的兽性的我才是他自己。</p> 
<p>他身上发生各种可怕的变化，只是由于他不再坚持自己的信念而相信别人的理论。他不再坚持自己的信念而相信别人的理论，因为要是坚持自己的信念，日子就太不好过。要是坚持自己的信念，处理一切事情就不利于追求轻浮享乐的兽性的我，而总会同它抵触。相信别人的理论，就根本无须处理什么，一切问题都迎刃而解，而且总是同精神的我抵触而有利于兽性的我。此外，他要是坚持自己的信念，总会遭到人家的谴责；他要是相信别人的理论，就会获得周围人们的赞扬。</p> 
<p>譬如，聂赫留朵夫思索上帝、真理、财富、贫穷等问题，阅读有关书籍并同人家谈论这些事，人家就会觉得不合时宜，简直有点可笑，他的母亲和姑妈就会好意地取笑他，戏称他是我们亲爱的哲学家。但他看爱情小说，讲淫秽笑话，到法国剧院看轻松喜剧，并且津津乐道，大家就称赞他，鼓励他。他省吃俭用，穿旧大衣，不喝酒，大家就觉得他脾气古怪，有意标新立异。他在打猎上挥金如土，在布置书房上穷奢极侈，大家就吹捧他风雅脱俗，还送给他贵重礼品。他原来童贞无瑕，并且想保持到结婚，但他的亲人都为他担忧，以为他有病，后来他母亲知道他从同事手里夺了一个法国女人，成了真正的男子汉，不仅不难过，反而感到高兴。但公爵夫人一想到儿子同卡秋莎的关系，而且可能同她结婚，就感到忧心忡忡。</p> 
<p>同样，聂赫留朵夫成年以后，他把父亲遗留给他的一块面积不大的地产分赠给农民，因为他认为地主拥有土地是不合理的。不料他这种行为却使他的母亲和亲戚大为吃惊，并且从此成为大家嘲弄的话题。人家多次告诉他，获得土地的农民不仅没有发财，反而更穷了，因为他们开了三家小酒店，索性不干农活。等聂赫留朵夫进了近卫军，跟门第高贵的同僚们一起花天酒地，输去许多钱，弄得叶莲娜·伊凡诺夫娜不得不动用存款，她却满不在乎，反而认为这是理所当然的，甚至觉得年轻时在上流社会种些痘苗以增加免疫力，还是件好事。</p> 
<p>聂赫留朵夫起初作过反抗，但十分困难，因为凡是他凭自己的信念认为好的，别人却认为坏的；反之，他凭自己的信念认为坏的，别人却认为好的。最后聂赫留朵夫屈服了，不再坚持自己的信念而相信别人的话。开头这样的自我否定是很不愉快的，但这种不愉快的感觉并没有持续多久。就在这时聂赫留朵夫开始吸烟喝酒，他不再感到不愉快，甚至觉得轻松自在了。</p> 
<p>聂赫留朵夫天生热情好动，不久就沉湎于这种受亲友称道的新生活中，把内心的其他要求一概排斥了。这种变化开始于他来到彼得堡以后，而在他进入军界后彻底完成。</p> 
<p>军官生活本来就容易使人堕落。一个人一旦进入军界，就终日无所事事，也就是说脱离合理的有益劳动，逃避人们共同负担的义务。换来的则是军队、军服、军旗的荣誉。再有，一方面是颐指气使，对别人享有无限权力；另一方面，在长官面前却又奴颜婢膝，唯命是从。</p> 
<p>不过，除了进军队服务以及军服、军旗和合法的暴行屠杀所造成的一般性堕落外，在有钱有势的军官才能进入的近卫军团里，军官们因为富裕和接近皇室而格外堕落。这批人很容易发展成为疯狂的利己主义者。聂赫留朵夫自从担任军职，开始象同僚们那样生活以来，他就落入了这种疯狂的利己主义的泥沼之中。</p> 
<p>他没有什么正经事要做，只须穿上不是他自己而是别人精心缝制、洗刷干净的军服，戴上头盔，拿起别人铸造、擦亮并交到他手里的武器，跨上一匹由别人饲养和训练的骏马，跟着那些同他一样的人去参加练兵或者检阅，也就是纵马奔驰，挥舞马刀，开枪射击，并把这一套教给别人就行了。他们没有别的事做，但那些达官贵人，不论老少，连沙皇和他的亲信都赞同他们的活动，甚至因此夸奖他们，感谢他们。这些活动结束以后，他们认为正当和重要的是到军官俱乐部或者豪华的饭店里去吃吃喝喝，纵情挥霍不知从哪里弄来的金钱；然后就是剧场，舞会，女人，然后又是骑马，舞刀，奔驰，然后又是挥金如土，喝酒，打牌，玩女人。</p> 
<p>这样的生活对军人的腐蚀特别厉害，因为要是一个平民过这样的生活，他内心深处就会感到害臊。军人过这样的生活却心安理得，并且自吹自擂，引以为荣，特别是在战争时期。聂赫留朵夫正好是在向土耳其宣战后进入军队的。“我们准备为国捐躯，因此这种花天酒地的生活不仅可以原谅，而且在我们是必要的。所以我们才这样过日子。”</p> 
<p>聂赫留朵夫在生命的这个阶段也隐隐约约有这样的想法。他由于冲破了以前给自己定下的种种道德藩篱，一直感到轻松愉快，并且经常处于利己主义的疯狂状态中。</p> 
<p>三年后他到姑妈家去的时候，正处在这样的精神状态中。</p>
