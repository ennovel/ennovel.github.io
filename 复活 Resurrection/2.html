<p>The story of the prisoner Maslova's life was a very common one.</p> 
<p>Maslova's mother was the unmarried daughter of a village woman, employed on a dairy farm, which belonged to two maiden ladies who were landowners. This unmarried woman had a baby every year, and, as often happens among the village people, each one of these undesired babies, after it had been carefully baptised, was neglected by its mother, whom it hindered at her work, and left to starve. Five children had died in this way. They had all been baptised and then not sufficiently fed, and just left to die. The sixth baby, whose father was a gipsy tramp, would have shared the same fate, had it not so happened that one of the maiden ladies came into the farmyard to scold the dairymaids for sending up cream that smelt of the cow. The young woman was lying in the cowshed with a fine, healthy, new-born baby. The old maiden lady scolded the maids again for allowing the woman (who had just been confined) to lie in the cowshed, and was about to go away, but seeing the baby her heart was touched, and she offered to stand godmother to the little girl, and pity for her little god-daughter induced her to give milk and a little money to the mother, so that she should feed the baby; and the little girl lived. The old ladies spoke of her as "the saved one." When the child was three years old, her mother fell ill and died, and the maiden ladies took the child from her old grandmother, to whom she was nothing but a burden.</p> 
<p>The little black-eyed maiden grew to be extremely pretty, and so full of spirits that the ladies found her very entertaining.</p> 
<p>The younger of the ladies, Sophia Ivanovna, who had stood godmother to the girl, had the kinder heart of the two sisters; Maria Ivanovna, the elder, was rather hard. Sophia Ivanovna dressed the little girl in nice clothes, and taught her to read and write, meaning to educate her like a lady. Maria Ivanovna thought the child should be brought up to work, and trained her to be a good servant. She was exacting; she punished, and, when in a bad temper, even struck the little girl. Growing up under these two different influences, the girl turned out half servant, half young lady. They called her Katusha, which sounds less refined than Katinka, but is not quite so common as Katka. She used to sew, tidy up the rooms, polish the metal cases of the icons and do other light work, and sometimes she sat and read to the ladies.</p> 
<p>Though she had more than one offer, she would not marry. She felt that life as the wife of any of the working men who were courting her would be too hard; spoilt as she was by a life of case.</p> 
<p>She lived in this manner till she was sixteen, when the nephew of the old ladies, a rich young prince, and a university student, came to stay with his aunts, and Katusha, not daring to acknowledge it even to herself, fell in love with him.</p> 
<p>Then two years later this same nephew stayed four days with his aunts before proceeding to join his regiment, and the night before he left he betrayed Katusha, and, after giving her a 100-rouble note, went away. Five months later she knew for certain that she was to be a mother. After that everything seemed repugnant to her, her only thought being how to escape from the shame that awaited her. She began not only to serve the ladies in a half-hearted and negligent way, but once, without knowing how it happened, was very rude to them, and gave them notice, a thing she repented of later, and the ladies let her go, noticing something wrong and very dissatisfied with her. Then she got a housemaid's place in a police-officer's house, but stayed there only three months, for the police officer, a man of fifty, began to torment her, and once, when he was in a specially enterprising mood, she fired up, called him "a fool and old devil," and gave him such a knock in the chest that he fell. She was turned out for her rudeness. It was useless to look for another situation, for the time of her confinement was drawing near, so she went to the house of a village midwife, who also sold wine. The confinement was easy; but the midwife, who had a case of fever in the village, infected Katusha, and her baby boy had to be sent to the foundlings' hospital, where, according to the words of the old woman who took him there, he at once died. When Katusha went to the midwife she had 127 roubles in all, 27 which she had earned and 100 given her by her betrayer. When she left she had but six roubles; she did not know how to keep money, but spent it on herself, and gave to all who asked. The midwife took 40 roubles for two months' board and attendance, 25 went to get the baby into the foundlings' hospital, and 40 the midwife borrowed to buy a cow with. Twenty roubles went just for clothes and dainties. Having nothing left to live on, Katusha had to look out for a place again, and found one in the house of a forester. The forester was a married man, but he, too, began to annoy her from the first day. He disgusted her, and she tried to avoid him. But he, more experienced and cunning, besides being her master, who could send her wherever he liked, managed to accomplish his object. His wife found it out, and, catching Katusha and her husband in a room all by themselves, began beating her. Katusha defended herself, and they had a fight, and Katusha got turned out of the house without being paid her wages.</p> 
<p>Then Katusha went to live with her aunt in town. The aunt's husband, a bookbinder, had once been comfortably off, but had lost all his customers, and had taken to drink, and spent all he could lay hands on at the public-house. The aunt kept a little laundry, and managed to support herself, her children, and her wretched husband. She offered Katusha the place of an assistant laundress; but seeing what a life of misery and hardship her aunt's assistants led, Katusha hesitated, and applied to a registry office for a place. One was found for her with a lady who lived with her two sons, pupils at a public day school. A week after Katusha had entered the house the elder, a big fellow with moustaches, threw up his studies and made love to her, continually following her about. His mother laid all the blame on Katusha, and gave her notice.</p> 
<p>It so happened that, after many fruitless attempts to find a situation, Katusha again went to the registry office, and there met a woman with bracelets on her bare, plump arms and rings on most of her fingers. Hearing that Katusha was badly in want of a place, the woman gave her her address, and invited her to come to her house. Katusha went. The woman received her very kindly, set cake and sweet wine before her, then wrote a note and gave it to a servant to take to somebody. In the evening a tall man, with long, grey hair and a white beard, entered the room, and sat down at once near Katusha, smiling and gazing at her with glistening eyes. He began joking with her. The hostess called him away into the next room, and Katusha heard her say, "A fresh one from the country," Then the hostess called Katusha aside and told her that the man was an author, and that he had a great deal of money, and that if he liked her he would not grudge her anything. He did like her, and gave her 25 roubles, promising to see her often. The 25 roubles soon went; some she paid to her aunt for board and lodging; the rest was spent on a hat, ribbons, and such like. A few days later the author sent for her, and she went. He gave her another 25 roubles, and offered her a separate lodging.</p> 
<p>Next door to the lodging rented for her by the author there lived a jolly young shopman, with whom Katusha soon fell in love. She told the author, and moved to a little lodging of her own. The shopman, who promised to marry her, went to Nijni on business without mentioning it to her, having evidently thrown her up, and Katusha remained alone. She meant to continue living in the lodging by herself, but was informed by the police that in this case she would have to get a license. She returned to her aunt. Seeing her fine dress, her hat, and mantle, her aunt no longer offered her laundry work. As she understood things, her niece had risen above that sort of thing. The question as to whether she was to become a laundress or not did not occur to Katusha, either. She looked with pity at the thin, hard-worked laundresses, some already in consumption, who stood washing or ironing with their thin arms in the fearfully hot front room, which was always full of soapy steam and draughts from the windows, and thought with horror that she might have shared the same fate.</p> 
<p>Katusha had begun to smoke some time before, and since the young shopman had thrown her up she was getting more and more into the habit of drinking. It was not so much the flavour of wine that tempted her as the fact that it gave her a chance of forgetting the misery she suffered, making her feel more unrestrained and more confident of her own worth, which she was not when quite sober; without wine she felt sad and ashamed. Just at this time a woman came along who offered to place her in one of the largest establishments in the city, explaining all the advantages and benefits of the situation. Katusha had the choice before her of either going into service or accepting this offer--and she chose the latter. Besides, it seemed to her as though, in this way, she could revenge herself on her betrayer and the shopman and all those who had injured her. One of the things that tempted her, and was the cause of her decision, was the woman telling her she might order her own dresses--velvet, silk, satin, low-necked ball dresses, anything she liked. A mental picture of herself in a bright yellow silk trimmed with black velvet with low neck and short sleeves conquered her, and she gave up her passport. On the same evening the procuress took an isvostchik and drove her to the notorious house kept by Carolina Albertovna Kitaeva.</p> 
<p>From that day a life of chronic sin against human and divine laws commenced for Katusha Maslova, a life which is led by hundreds of thousands of women, and which is not merely tolerated but sanctioned by the Government, anxious for the welfare of its subjects; a life which for nine women out of ten ends in painful disease, premature decrepitude, and death.</p> 
<p>Katusha Maslova lived this life for seven years. During these years she twice changed houses, and had once been to the hospital. In the seventh year of this life, when she was twenty-six years old, happened that for which she was put in prison and for which she was now being taken to be tried, after more than three months of confinement with thieves and murderers in the stifling air of a prison.</p> 
<p>女犯玛丝洛娃的身世极其平几。她是一个未婚的女农奴的私生子。这女农奴跟着饲养牲口的母亲一起，在两个地主老姑娘的庄院里干活。这个没有结过婚的女人年年都生一个孩子，并且按照乡下习惯，总是给孩子行洗礼，然后做母亲的不再给这个违背她的心愿来到人间的孩子喂奶，因为这会影响她干活。于是，孩子不久就饿死了。</p> 
<p>就这样死了五个孩子。个个都行了洗礼，个个都没有吃奶，个个都死掉了。第六个孩子是跟一个过路的吉卜赛人生的，是个女孩。她的命运本来也不会有什么两样，可是那两个老姑娘中有一个凑巧来到牲口棚，斥责饲养员做的奶油有牛骚气。当时产妇和她那个白白胖胖的娃娃正躺在牲口棚里。那老姑娘因为奶油做得不好吃，又因为把产妇放进牲口棚里，大骂了一通，骂完正要走，忽然看见那娃娃，觉得很惹人爱怜，就自愿做她的教母。她给女孩行了洗礼，又因怜悯这个教女，常给做母亲的送点牛奶和钱。这样，女孩就活了下来。</p> 
<p>两个老姑娘从此就叫她“再生儿”。</p> 
<p>孩子三岁那年，她母亲害病死了。饲养牲口的外婆觉得外孙女是个累赘，两个老姑娘就把女孩领到身边抚养。这个眼睛乌溜溜的小女孩长得非常活泼可爱，两个老姑娘就常常拿她消遣解闷。</p> 
<p>这两个老姑娘中，妹妹索菲雅·伊凡诺夫娜心地比较善良，给女孩行洗礼的就是她；姐姐玛丽雅·伊凡诺夫娜脾气比较急躁。索菲雅把这娃娃打扮身漂漂亮亮，还教她念书，一心想把她培养成自己的养女。玛丽雅却要把她训练成一名出色的侍女，因此对她很严格，遇到自己情绪不好，就罚她甚至打她。由于两个老姑娘持不同的态度，小姑娘长大成人后，便一半成了个侍女，一半成了个养女。她的名字也不上不下，叫卡秋莎，而不叫卡吉卡，也不叫卡金卡。①她缝补衣服，收拾房间，擦拭圣像，煮茶烧菜，磨咖啡豆，煮咖啡，洗零星衣物，有时还坐下来给两个老姑娘读书解闷。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>①她的本名叫卡吉琳娜，卡吉卡是粗俗的叫法，卡金卡是高雅的称呼，而卡秋莎则是普通的小名。</p> 
<p>有人来给她说媒，她一概谢绝，觉得嫁给卖力气过活的男人，日子一定很苦。她已经过惯地主家的舒适生活。</p> 
<p>她就这样一直生活到十六岁。在满十六岁那年，两个老姑娘的侄儿，一个在大学念书的阔绰的公爵少爷来到她们家。卡秋莎暗暗爱上了他，却不敢向他表白，连自己都不敢承认产生了这种感情。两年后，这位侄少爷出发远征，途经姑妈家，又待了四天。临行前夜，他引诱了卡秋莎，动身那天塞给她一张百卢布钞票。他走了五个月后，她才断定自己怀孕了。</p> 
<p>从那时起，她变得性情烦躁，一味想着怎样才能避免即将临头的羞辱。她服侍两个老姑娘，不仅敷衍塞责，而且连自己都没想到，竟发起脾气来。她顶撞老姑娘，对她们说了不少粗话，事后又觉得懊悔，就要求辞工。</p> 
<p>两个老姑娘对她也很不满意，就放她走了。她从她们家里出来，到警察局长家做侍女，但只做了三个月，因为那局长虽然年已半百，还是对她纠缠不清。有一次，他逼得特别厉害，她发起火来，骂他混蛋和老鬼，狠狠地把他推开，他竟被推倒在地。她因此被解雇了。她再找工作已不可能，因为快要分娩，就寄居到乡下一个给人接生兼贩私酒的寡妇家里。分娩很顺利，可是那接生婆刚给一个有病的乡下女人接过生，便把产褥热传染给了卡秋莎。男孩一生下来就被送到育婴堂。据送去的老太婆说，婴儿一到那里就死了。</p> 
<p>卡秋莎住到接生婆家里的时候，身上总共有一百二十七卢布：二十七卢布是她自己挣的，一百卢布是引诱她的公爵少爷送的。等她从接生婆家里出来，手头只剩下六个卢布。她不懂得省吃俭用，很会花钱，待人又厚道，总是有求必应。接生婆向她要了四十卢布，作为两个月的伙食费和茶点钱，又要了二十五卢布，算是把婴儿送到育婴堂的费用。另外，接生婆又向她借了四十卢布买牛。剩下的二十几个卢布，卡秋莎自己买衣服，送礼，零星花掉了。这样，当卡秋莎身体复元时，她已身无分文，不得不重新找工作。她到林务官家干活。林务官虽然已有老婆，但也跟警察局长一样，从第一天起就缠住卡秋莎不放。卡秋莎讨厌他，竭力回避他。但他比卡秋莎狡猾老练，主要因为他是东家，可以任意支使她，终于找到了一个机会，把她占有了。做妻子的知道了这件事，有一次看到丈夫同卡秋莎单独待在房间里，就扑过去打她。卡秋莎不甘示弱，两人厮打起来。结果卡秋莎被撵了出来，连工资都没有拿到。此后卡秋莎来到城里，住在姨妈家。姨父是个装订工，原先日子过得不错，后来主顾越来越少，他就借酒解愁，把家里的东西都变卖喝掉了。</p> 
<p>姨妈开了一家小洗衣店，借以养活儿女，供养潦倒的丈夫。姨妈要玛丝洛娃进她的洗衣店干活。但玛丝洛娃看到洗衣店里女工的艰苦生活，犹豫不决，就到荐头行找工作，给人家当女仆。她找到了一户人家，有一位太太和两个念中学的男孩。进去才一星期，那个念中学六年级的留小胡子的大儿子就丢下功课，缠住玛丝洛娃，不让她安宁。做母亲的却一味责怪玛丝洛娃，把她解雇了。玛丝洛娃没有找到新的工作，但在荐头行里无意中遇到一位手上戴满戒指、肥胖的光胳膊上戴着手镯的太太。这位太太知道了玛丝洛娃的处境，就留下地址，请玛丝洛娃到她家去。玛丝洛娃去找她。这位太太亲热地招待她，请她吃馅饼和甜酒，同时打发侍女送一封信到什么地方去。傍晚就有一个须发花白的高个子来到这屋里。这老头子一来就挨着玛丝洛娃坐下，眼睛闪闪发亮，笑嘻嘻地打量着她，同她说笑。女主人把他叫到另一个房间，玛丝洛娃但听得女主人说：“刚从乡下来的，新鲜得很呐！”然后女主人把玛丝洛娃叫去，对她说他是作家，钱多得要命，只要她能如他的意，他是不会舍不得花钱的。她果然如了他的意，他就给了她二十五卢布，还答应常常同她相会。她付清了姨妈家的生活费，买了新衣服、帽子和缎带，很快就把钱花光了。过了几天，作家又来请她去。她去了。他又给了她二十五卢布，叫她搬到一个独门独户的寓所去住。</p> 
<p>玛丝洛娃住在作家替她租下的寓所里，却爱上了同院一个快乐的店员。她主动把这事告诉作家，然后又搬到一个更小的独户寓所里去住。那个店员起初答应同她结婚，后来竟不辞而别，到下城去，显然是把她抛弃了。这样，玛丝洛娃又剩下孤零零一个人。她本想独个儿继续住在那个寓所里，可是人家不答应。派出所长对她说，她要领到黄色执照①，接受医生检查，才能单独居住。于是她又回到姨妈家。姨妈见她穿戴着时式的衣服、披肩和帽子，客客气气接待她，再也不敢要她做洗衣妇，认为她现在的身价高了。而对玛丝洛娃来说，她根本不考虑做洗衣妇的问题。她瞧着前面几个屋子里的洗衣妇，对她们充满怜悯。她们脸色苍白，胳膊干瘦，有的己得了痨病，过着苦役犯一般的生活。那里不论冬夏，窗子一直敞开着，她们就在三十度②高温的肥皂蒸汽里洗熨衣服。玛丝洛娃一想到她也可能服这样的苦役，不禁感到恐惧。</p> 
<p>就在玛丝洛娃没有任何依靠，生活无着的时候，一个为妓院物色姑娘的牙婆找到了她。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>①帝俄政府发的妓女执照。</p> 
<p>②指列氏温度。列氏温度计把冰点作0度，沸点作80度，列氏30度等于摄氏37．5度。</p> 
<p>玛丝洛娃早就抽上香烟，而在她同店员姘居的后期和被他抛弃以后，就越来越离不开酒瓶。她之所以离不开酒瓶，不仅因为酒味醇美，更因为酒能使她忘记身受的一切痛苦，暂时解脱烦闷，增强自尊心。而这样的精神状态不喝酒是无法维持的。她不喝酒就觉得意气消沉，羞耻难当。</p> 
<p>牙婆招待姨妈吃饭，把玛丝洛娃灌醉，要她到城里一家最高级的妓院去做生意，又向她列举干这个营生的种种好处。玛丝洛娃面临着一场选择：或者低声下气去当女仆，但这样就逃避不了男人的纠缠，不得不同人临时秘密通奸；或者取得生活安定而又合法的地位，就是进行法律所容许而又报酬丰厚的长期的公开通奸。她选择了后一条。此外，她想用这种方式来报复诱奸她的年轻公爵、店员和一切欺侮过她的男人。同时还有一个条件诱惑她，使她最后打定主意，那就是牙婆答应她，她喜爱什么衣服，就可以做什么衣服，丝绒的，法伊绉①的，绸缎的，袒胸露臂的舞衫，等等，任凭挑选。玛丝洛娃想象着自己穿上一件袒胸黑丝绒滚边的鹅黄连衣裙的情景，再也经不住诱惑，就交出身份证去换取黄色执照。当天晚上，牙婆雇来一辆马车，把她带到著名的基塔耶娃妓院里。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>①正反两面都有横条纹的丝织品或毛织品。</p> 
<p>从此以后，玛丝洛娃就经常违背上帝的诫命和人类道德，过起犯罪的生活来。千百万妇女过着这种生活，不仅获得关心公民福利的政府的许可，而且受到它的保护。最后，这类妇女十个倒有九个受着恶疾的折磨，未老先衰，过早夭折。</p> 
<p>夜间纵酒作乐，白天昏睡不醒。下午两三点钟，她们才懒洋洋地从肮脏的床上爬起来，喝矿泉水醒酒，或者喝咖啡，身上穿着罩衫、短上衣或者长睡衣，没精打采地在几个房间里走来走去，隔着窗帘望望窗外，有气无力地对骂几句。接着是梳洗，擦油，往身上和头发上洒香水，试衣服，为服饰同老鸨吵嘴，反复照镜子，涂脂抹粉，画眉毛，吃油腻的甜点心；最后穿上袒露肉体的鲜艳绸衫，来到灯火辉煌的华丽大厅里。客人陆续到来，奏乐，跳舞，吃糖，喝酒，吸烟，通奸。客人中间有年轻的，有中年的，有半大孩子，有龙钟的老头，有单身的，有成家的，有商人，有店员，有亚美尼亚人，有犹太人，有鞑靼人，有富裕的，有贫穷的，有强壮的，有病弱的，有喝醉的，有清醒的，有粗野的，有温柔的，有军人，有文官，有大学生，有中学生。总之，各种不同身分，不同年龄，不同性格的男人，应有尽有。又是喧闹又是调笑，又是打架又是音乐，吸烟喝酒，喝酒吸烟，音乐从黄昏一直响到天明。直到早晨，她们才得脱身和睡觉。天天如此，个个星期都是这样。每到周末，她们乘车去到政府机关——警察分局，那里坐着官员和医生，都是男人。他们的态度有时严肃认真，有时轻浮粗野，蹂躏了不仅为人类所赋有、甚至连禽兽都具备的那种足以防止犯罪的羞耻心，给这些女人检查身体，发给她们许可证，使她们可以和同谋者再干上一星期同类罪行。下一个星期还是这样。天天如此，不分冬夏，没有假期。</p> 
<p>玛丝洛娃就这样过了七年。在这期间，她换过两家妓院，住过一次医院。在她进妓院的第七年，也是她初次失身后的第八年，那时她才二十六岁，不料出了一件事，使她进了监狱。她在牢里同杀人犯和盗贼一起生活了六个月，今天被押解到法院受审。</p>
