She was to make her debut on the third of January, at a magnificent ball, which her mamma proposed to give to all the nobility and choice gentry of O--- and its neighbourhood for twenty miles round. Of course, she looked forward to it with the wildest impatience, and the most extravagant anticipations of delight.</p> 
<p>'Miss Grey,' said she, one evening, a month before the all- important day, as I was perusing a long and extremely interesting letter of my sister's--which I had just glanced at in the morning to see that it contained no very bad news, and kept till now, unable before to find a quiet moment for reading it,--'Miss Grey, do put away that dull, stupid letter, and listen to me! I'm sure my talk must be far more amusing than that.'</p> 
<p>She seated herself on the low stool at my feet; and I, suppressing a sigh of vexation, began to fold up the epistle.</p> 
<p>'You should tell the good people at home not to bore you with such long letters,' said she; 'and, above all, do bid them write on proper note-paper, and not on those great vulgar sheets. You should see the charming little lady-like notes mamma writes to her friends.'</p> 
<p>'The good people at home,' replied I, 'know very well that the longer their letters are, the better I like them. I should be very sorry to receive a charming little lady-like note from any of them; and I thought you were too much of a lady yourself, Miss Murray, to talk about the "vulgarity" of writing on a large sheet of paper.'</p> 
<p>'Well, I only said it to tease you. But now I want to talk about the ball; and to tell you that you positively must put off your holidays till it is over.'</p> 
<p>'Why so?--I shall not be present at the ball.'</p> 
<p>'No, but you will see the rooms decked out before it begins, and hear the music, and, above all, see me in my splendid new dress. I shall be so charming, you'll be ready to worship me--you really must stay.'</p> 
<p>'I should like to see you very much; but I shall have many opportunities of seeing you equally charming, on the occasion of some of the numberless balls and parties that are to be, and I cannot disappoint my friends by postponing my return so long.'</p> 
<p>'Oh, never mind your friends! Tell them we won't let you go.'</p> 
<p>'But, to say the truth, it would be a disappointment to myself: I long to see them as much as they to see me--perhaps more.'</p> 
<p>'Well, but it is such a short time.'</p> 
<p>'Nearly a fortnight by my computation; and, besides, I cannot bear the thoughts of a Christmas spent from home: and, moreover, my sister is going to be married.'</p> 
<p>'Is she--when?'</p> 
<p>'Not till next month; but I want to be there to assist her in making preparations, and to make the best of her company while we have her.'</p> 
<p>'Why didn't you tell me before?'</p> 
<p>'I've only got the news in this letter, which you stigmatize as dull and stupid, and won't let me read.'</p> 
<p>'To whom is she to be married?'</p> 
<p>'To Mr. Richardson, the vicar of a neighbouring parish.'</p> 
<p>'Is he rich?'</p> 
<p>'No; only comfortable.'</p> 
<p>'Is he handsome?'</p> 
<p>'No; only decent.'</p> 
<p>'Young?'</p> 
<p>'No; only middling.'</p> 
<p>'Oh, mercy! what a wretch! What sort of a house is it?'</p> 
<p>'A quiet little vicarage, with an ivy-clad porch, an old-fashioned garden, and--'</p> 
<p>'Oh, stop!--you'll make me sick. How CAN she bear it?'</p> 
<p>'I expect she'll not only be able to bear it, but to be very happy. You did not ask me if Mr. Richardson were a good, wise, or amiable man; I could have answered Yes, to all these questions--at least so Mary thinks, and I hope she will not find herself mistaken.'</p> 
<p>'But--miserable creature! how can she think of spending her life there, cooped up with that nasty old man; and no hope of change?'</p> 
<p>'He is not old: he's only six or seven and thirty; and she herself is twenty-eight, and as sober as if she were fifty.'</p> 
<p>'Oh! that's better then--they're well matched; but do they call him the "worthy vicar"?'</p> 
<p>'I don't know; but if they do, I believe he merits the epithet.'</p> 
<p>'Mercy, how shocking! and will she wear a white apron and make pies and puddings?'</p> 
<p>'I don't know about the white apron, but I dare say she will make pies and puddings now and then; but that will be no great hardship, as she has done it before.'</p> 
<p>'And will she go about in a plain shawl, and a large straw bonnet, carrying tracts and bone soup to her husband's poor parishioners?'</p> 
<p>'I'm not clear about that; but I dare say she will do her best to make them comfortable in body and mind, in accordance with our mother's example.'</p>
