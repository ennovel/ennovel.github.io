<p>In the morning I climbed a hill，and looked out over the sea，but there was nothing at all on the water．And around me on the island，I could not see any houses or people．I did not like to think what had happened to my friend Alan and the others，and I did not want to look at this emptiness any longer．So I climbed down again，and walked eastwards．I was hoping to find a house，where I could dry my clothes，and get something to eat． I soon discovered that nobody lived on Earraid．It was too far to swim to Mull，which could see across the water．I thought perhaps I could wade across，but when I tried it，the water was too deep，and I had to turn back．By now it had started to rain，and I felt very miserable．</p> 
<p>Then I remembered the piece of wood，which had already saved my life once．It would help me to get across the sea to Mull！So I walked all the way back to the beach where I had arrived．The piece of wood was in the sea，so I waded into the water to get it．But as I came closer，it moved away from me．And when the water was too deep for me to stand，the piece of wood was still several metres away．I had to leave it，and went back to the beach．It was a terrible moment for me．I was feeling very tired，hungry and thirsty，with no hope of getting away from this lonely island．For the first time since leaving Essendean，I lay down and cried． I do not want to remember the time that I spent on Earraid．I had nothing with me except my uncle's gold and Alan's silver button，and as I had never lived near the sea，I did not know what to eat or how to fish．In fact，I found some shellfish among the rocks on the coast，and ate them，but I was very sick afterwards．That was the only food that I could find，so I was always hungry on Earraid．All day and all night it rained heavily，but there was no roof or tree on the island，and my clothes were cold and wet on my body．</p> 
<p>I chose to spend most of my time in the north of Earraid，on a little hill．From here I could see the old church on the island of Iona，not far away to the west，and smoke from people's houses on Mull，to the east．I used to watch this smoke，and think of the people there，and their comfortable lives．This gave me a little hope，in my lonely life among the rocks and the rain and the cold sea．</p> 
<p>Two days passed，and on the third day two things happened．First，I discovered that I had lost almost all my money through a hole in my pocket．I only had three of my uncle's thirty-eight pounds left．But worse was to come．While I was sitting on a rock，looking out over Iona，I suddenly noticed a small boat moving fast through the Water．I jumped to my feet and shouted as loudly as I could．The two men in the boat were near enough to hear．They shouted back in Gaelic，and laughed．But the boat did not turn，and sailed on，right in front of my eyes，to Iona． I could not understand why they did not come to help me．I continued shouting wildly，although I could no longer see them．And then，I lay down and cried for the second time．This time I wasn't sad，but angry，because I thought that they had left me to die alone in that terrible place．</p> 
<p>The next morning，I was surprised to see that the same men were sailing towards Earraid from Iona．At once I ran down to the rocky coast to meet them．The boat came near me，but stayed a few metres away in the water．There was a third man in the boat，who was talking and laughing with the others．Then he stood up and spoke fast to me in Gaelic，which I could not understand．But sometimes he used an English word，and once I heard the word ‘tide’．This gave me a flash of hope． ‘Do you mean—that when the tide is low…？’I cried，and could not finish． ‘Yes，yes，’he called back，‘tide，’and laughed again． I turned my back on the boat and ran back excitedly to the east of the island，where Earraid was the closest to Mull．And sure enough，there was now only a little water between the is lands．I was able to wade through it easily，and reached Mull with a happy shout．How stupid of me not to realize that it was possible to get to Mull，twice a day，at low tide！Now I felt very grateful to the boatmen for guessing my problem，and coming back to help me． I walked towards the smoke that I had seen so often from Earraid，and reached a long，low house built of stone．Outside sat an old man，smoking his pipe in the sun．He spoke a little English， and told me that the officers and sailors from the ship had all arrived there safely a few days before． ‘Was one of them dressed in fine clothes？’I asked． ‘Aye，there was one like that，’he smiled．‘Ye must be the lad with the silver button！’ ‘Why，yes！’I said，surprised． ‘Well then，your friend says that ye must follow him to the house of his clansman，James Stewart，in Appin．’</p> 
<p>He and his wife gave me food and drink，and let me sleep that night in their house． In the morning I thanked them for their kindness，and started my journey to Appin．</p> 
<p>I walked across Mull to Torosay，where I took a boat across the water to Lochaline．Then I walked to Kingairlock，where I took another boat across Loch Linnhe to Appin．This took six days，and on my way I met and spoke to a number of travellers．I heard all about Alan's clan，the Stewarts，and their enemies，the Campbells．Although they were both High land clans，the Campbells and Stewarts had hated each other for years，and now the Campbells were helping the English army drive many Highlanders out of their homes． Indeed， in a day or two， I heard， red-haired Colin Campbell himself was com ing to Appin， with King George's soldiers， to drive the Stew arts out and so destroy his enemies． But I heard also of James Stewart， head of the Stewart clan in Appin， and that he and his clansmen would dearly love to see Colin Campbell dead．</p> 
<p>People also talked of a man called Alan Breck． Some called him a murderer； others said that he was a brave fighter． He was in danger every time he returned to the Highlands，be cause the English would pay a good price for him-dead or alive． I listened with interest to everything that they told me．But I liked it best when I heard Alan described as a fine man and an honest Highlander．</p> 
<p>When I got out of the boat in Appin， I sat down among some trees to decide what to do next． Should I go on， and join Alan， whose friends were King George's enemies， and whose life was full of danger，or should I go back south again，quietly and safely， to the Lowlands？</p> 
<p>As I was thinking， four men on horses came past me on the road． As soon as I saw these men， I decided to continue my adventure， although I cannot explain why．</p> 
<p>I stopped the first man， who was tall and red－haired．</p> 
<p>‘Could you tell me the way to James Stewart's house，sir？’I asked．</p> 
<p>All the men looked at each other． The red－haired man did not reply，but spoke to one of the others，who looked like a lawyer．‘Is Stewart calling his people together， do ye think？’</p> 
<p>The lawyer replied，‘We'd better wait here for the sold iers to join us， before we go any further．’</p> 
<p>The red－haired man，I suddenly realized，must be Colin Campbell himself．‘If you're worried about me，’ I said，‘I'm not a Stewart， but a Lowlander， and I'm for King George．’ ‘That's well said，’ replied Campbell，‘but， if I may ask，why is an honest Lowlander like you so far from his home？Today is not a good day for travelling． This is the day when the Appin Stewarts have to leave their farms， and there may be trouble．”</p> 
<p>He was turning to speak to the lawyer again，</p> 
<p>when there came a sudden bang from the hill， and Campbell fell off his horse．‘They've shot me！’ he cried， holding his heart．</p> 
<p>He died almost immediately． The men's faces were white as they looked down at his body．I saw something move on the hill，and noticed， among the trees， a man with a gun， turning away from the road．</p> 
<p>‘Look！ The murderer！’ I cried， and began to run up the hill towards him． He saw me chasing him， and went faster．Soon he disappeared behind a rock， and I could no longer see him． I stopped next to some trees， then I heard a voice below，on the road．</p> 
<p>The lawyer was shouting to a large number of redcoated soldiers， who had just joined the men around Campbell's dead body．‘Ten pounds if ye catch that lad！’ he cried．He's one of the murderers！ He stopped us in the road，to give the killer a better chance to shoot Campbell！’</p> 
<p>Now I felt a new kind of fear． My life was in serious danger， although I had not done anything wrong．</p> 
<p>My mouth felt dry， and for a moment I could not move． I stood there in the open，on the hill，while the soldiers lifted their guns，ready to shoot．</p> 
<p>‘Jump in here among the trees，’ said a voice near me．</p> 
<p>I did not know what I was doing， but I obeyed． As I did so， I heard the banging of the guns， and realized that the sol diers were shooting at me． In the shadow of the trees， I found Alan Breck standing there． It was he who had spoken to me．</p> 
<p>3 戴维是独自一人</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>晚上很冷，所以我不能坐下来休息。反之，我在沙滩上走来走去，以试着保暖。除了波涛声外，再也没有别的声音了。我感到非常孤独，也很害怕。</p> 
<p>早晨，我爬上一座小山，远望大海，但水上什么也没看见。而在岛上，我的四周也没有房屋或者人们。我不愿多想我的朋友艾伦和别人出了什么事，而且我也不想再看这片荒野了。于是我又爬下来，朝东走去。我希望自己能找到一座房子，能在那儿弄干衣服并找点东西吃。</p> 
<p>我很快就发现没有人居住在伊锐德。要游到马尔去太远了，隔着水我能看到那儿。我琢磨着等退潮时也许能蹚过去，但我试时水太深了，我不得不退回来。这时开始下起雨来，我感到非常难受。</p> 
<p>接着我想起了那块木板，曾救过我性命的那块。它将能帮着我渡过大海到达马尔！于是我返回到我到达时的那片海滩。那块木头在海里，于是我蹚水去取它。可是，我一靠近些时，木头就从我身边漂走了。水深得我都站不住时，那片木头离我还有几米远。我不得不随它去，回到岸上。这对我来说是很难受的一刻。我感到非常累，又饥又渴，觉得没有希望从这个孤岛上逃身。离开埃森丁后我第一次躺下来哭了起来。</p> 
<p>我不想再记起我在伊锐德岛的日子。除了我叔叔的金子和艾伦的银扣子，我一无所有；而且因为以前我从来没有在海边生活过，我不知道该吃什么或怎样捕鱼。事实上，在海岸的礁石中间我找到了一些贝，吃了，但过后我感到非常恶心。那是我所能找到的唯一食品，因此在伊锐德岛我总是处于饥饿状态。整天整夜雨都下得很大，但岛上没有树，也没有屋檐，我的衣服裹着身体，又冷又潮。</p> 
<p>经选择我把我的大部分时间花在伊锐德岛北部的一座小山上。从这儿我能看见西边不远处爱欧娜岛上古老的教堂和东边马尔岛上的住户的房中冒出的炊烟。我望着炊烟，想像着生活在那里的人们和他们舒适的生活。这给我在凄风冷海中、在礁石之间过着的孤独的生活带来一丝希望。</p> 
<p>两天过去了，第三天发生了两件事。首先，我发现我几乎所有的钱都从口袋上的一个洞那儿漏掉了。叔叔给我的38镑钱只剩下3镑。可是更糟糕的事接踵而至了。当我坐在一块礁石上远望比爱欧娜岛更远处时，我忽然注意到一条小船飞快地驶过水面。我突然站起来，竭尽全力地叫。船上的那两个人离我近到了能够听到我的声音的程度。他们用盖尔语对我大声回话，大笑着。但船没有掉头，继续向前驶着，在我眼巴巴的注视之下直至爱欧娜岛。</p> 
<p>我不明白他们为什么不来帮助我。虽然我看不见他们了，但我继续狂叫着。接着，我躺下来，又一次哭了。这一次我并不伤心，而是气愤，因为我想到他们把我留在这个可怕的地方，让我孤零零地死去。</p> 
<p>第二天早上，我惊奇地看见正是那两个人从爱欧娜岛向伊锐德岛驶来。我立刻跑下来，来到礁岩岸边迎接他们。船到了我附近，但停在水中离我几米远处。船上除这两个人外，还有一个人，他正和另外两个人说笑着。然后他站起来，用盖尔语对我飞快地说起来，那我听不懂。但有时他也用一个英语单词，一次我听到“潮水”这个词。这给了我一丝希望。</p> 
<p>“您是说——当潮水退低时……？”我大声地喊着，但没能说完。</p> 
<p>“对，对，”他回话道，“潮水，”接着又笑了。</p> 
<p>我转过身，背对着小船，激动地跑回小岛的东端，在那儿伊锐德岛离马尔岛最近。而且很肯定的是现在两岛之间的水很少。我能够轻易地蹚过去，随着一声欢快的叫声我到达马尔。我多傻，竟没有意识到我能乘低潮时一天两次地到马尔！我非常感激那些船夫，他们猜到了我的问题而且还回来帮助我。</p> 
<p>我向我在伊锐德岛上曾这么多次地看到的那缕炊烟走去，到了一个长长的、低矮的石屋那儿。屋外坐着一位老人，正在太阳下用烟斗吸烟。他讲一点儿英语，告诉我那条船上的高级船员和水手几天前就已安全地到达了那儿。</p> 
<p>“其中有一位穿着考究的人吗？”我问道。</p> 
<p>“对，有像那么回事的一位。”他微笑着，“你一定是那个有银扣子的小伙子！”</p> 
<p>“哎，我是！”我说道，感到惊讶。</p> 
<p>“那样的话，你的朋友说你一定得跟着他到他族人詹姆斯·斯图尔特的、位于阿平的家去。”</p> 
<p>他和妻子给我吃的和喝的，并让我夜晚睡在他们家里。早晨我谢过了他们的好意，开始了去往阿平的旅途。</p> 
<p>我穿过马尔岛来到托罗塞岛，乘船来到洛哈林。接着我走到金盖尔洛克，在那儿又乘船穿过林荷溯到达阿平。这花了我6天时间，一路上我遇到了不少赶路人并和他们进行了交谈。我听说了艾伦的氏族斯图尔特人和他们的仇人坎贝尔人的所有的事。虽然他们都是苏格兰高地氏族，但坎贝尔人和斯图尔特人互相仇恨已有数年之久，而且坎贝尔人现在正在帮着英格兰部队把很多高地人驱赶出他们的家园。事实上，我又听说一两天后长着红头发的科林·坎贝尔将带领乔治国王的部队到阿平驱逐斯图尔特人，这样就能打垮他的敌人。但我又听说阿平的斯图尔特氏族的头领詹姆斯·斯图尔特和他的族人将非常喜欢看到科林·坎贝尔被打死。</p> 
<p>人们也谈论一个叫艾伦·布雷克的人。有人叫他杀人犯，也有另外一些人说他是个英勇的斗士。因为英格兰人出高价悬赏捉拿他——不管他是活还是死的，所以每次他返回苏格兰高地时都处在危险之中。我饶有兴趣地听着人们告诉我的每一件事。但当我听到艾伦被描绘成一个品德不错的人和一个诚实的苏格兰高地人时我最喜欢。</p> 
<p>我在阿平下船后，坐在一些树中决定下一步该怎么办。是继续走并伴随其朋友与乔治国王为敌及其生活充满了危险的艾伦呢，还是悄悄地、安全地又回南方到低地去？</p> 
<p>当我思考时，四个人骑着马从我面前走过。虽然我无法解释原因，但我一看见他们就决定继续我的冒险。我挡住了第一个人，那是个高个子并长着红头发。</p> 
<p>“您能告诉我去詹姆斯·斯图尔特家怎么走吗，先生？”我问道。</p> 
<p>所有的人互相看着。长红头发的人没有回答，但对其他人中一个看似律师的人说：“你53是否认为斯图尔特正在召集他的民众呢？”</p> 
<p>律师回答道：“在我们继续走之前，最好在这儿等士兵来加入我们的队伍。”</p> 
<p>这个长红头发的人，我猛然意识到一定是科林·坎贝尔本人。“如果你们为我烦恼的话，”我说，“（我告诉你）我可不是斯图尔特人，而是一个低地人，我赞成乔治国王一边。”</p> 
<p>“那说得漂亮。”坎贝尔回答道，“但是，允许我问一句，为什么像你这样一个诚实的低地人要远离你的家园呢？今天并不是个适于旅行的好天。就是在今天所有的在阿平的斯图尔特人都得离开他们的农场，这可能会有事端。”</p> 
<p>忽然从山上传来砰的一声时，他正又扭头和他的律师说话，接着他就应声落马了。“他们打中了我！”他手捂着心脏，喊着。</p> 
<p>他几乎马上就死了，当他们俯视着他的尸体时，他们的脸像纸一样苍白。我看见小山上有什么东西在移动，并透过树丛注意到有一个带枪的人从路上跑开了。</p> 
<p>“看！杀人犯！”我叫着，开始拔腿上山向他跑去。他看见我追他，跑得更快了。很快他在一块岩石后消失了，我再也看不见他了。我在一些树旁停住了，接着听到从下面的路上传来一个声音。律师正对着一大群身穿红色制服的士兵大喊，他们正并入围拢坎贝尔的尸体的人中。“谁抓住那个小伙子，给谁10镑！”他喊道。“他是其中的一个谋杀犯！他在路上截住我们，给刺杀者向坎贝尔开枪的良机！”</p> 
<p>现在我感到一种别样的恐惧。虽然我什么都没做错，但我的生命处在巨大的危险之中。我口干舌燥，有一会儿竟不能动弹。我站在山上的空旷处，而这时士兵们举起了枪，准备射击。</p> 
<p>“跳进这里，到树丛里来，”我附近有个声音说道。</p> 
<p>我不知道我在干什么，但我遵从了。我这么做时，听到了枪的砰砰声，并意识到士兵们在向我开枪。在树的阴暗处，我发现艾伦·布雷克站在那儿。刚才是他和我说话。</p>
