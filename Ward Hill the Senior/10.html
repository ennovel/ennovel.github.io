<br> 
<br> Ward at once left his room and went to search for Little Pond. He met the lad coming across the campus, and in response to his invitation, the little fellow immediately returned with him, and for a long time they sat together in Pond's room and talked over the plan which Ward had formed.
<br> 
<br> "You see it's this way," said Ward. "We can't let this thing go on forever, for it's beginning to tell on us already. What with setting the room to rights and never knowing what to expect, it doesn't leave very much time for studying, and that's what I want this term. Now Mike has put a new lock on my door and on yours too, so these fellows won't be able to break in for a day or two, anyway."
<br> 
<br> "Then I don't see what you can do," said Pond. "If they can't get in, they can't do any mischief, and if they don't do any mischief, you can't catch them."
<br> 
<br> "That's all true; but what I want is to find out who the fellows are. I know well enough now, but I want the proof, you see. Now, my plan is this. They won't have any keys to the new locks, so they can't get in now if they try, and I don't think they'll try to-day. But to-morrow is Saturday, and in the afternoon we don't have any recitations, you know. Well, I'm going off up to the glen to-morrow afternoon and I'll take pains to let it be known that I sha'n't be in my room. That'll leave the coast all clear, you see, and I think somebody will be pretty sure to come up and try to get in while I'm away. Then I want you to stay in your room and keep watch. You can have your door just a little bit ajar, and whenever you hear any one coming up the stairs, you can keep an eye on them. You can see them without being seen yourself, and if they go and try to get in my room, or come up to yours, why, then we'll know who it is that's doing the work, though I don't think there's any difficulty now in picking out the ones who have been the prime movers in it."
<br> 
<br> "All right, Ward," replied Pond; "I'll do it."
<br> 
<br> "You see it's as much to your advantage as it is to mine," said Ward, as he rose to depart. "We don't want this thing kept up any longer, and I think if we can catch the fellows now, we'll put an end to it, though it may break out somewhere else in a worse way."
<br> 
<br> Satisfied with what he had done, Ward ran down the stairs, and just as he was unlocking the door of his room, Henry and Jack Hobart came up together into the hall. Ward's first impulse was to turn and leave the building. He had no desire to meet Jack then, but quickly changing his purpose, he unlocked the door and waited for the two boys to enter.
<br> 
<br> "Hello, Ward!" said Jack. "We've been talking about you, and finally decided we'd better stop that and come straight over here and talk to you."
<br> 
<br> Ward made no reply, and as Henry was apparently busied in arranging the papers and books on his table, Jack felt that the burden of the conversation was resting upon himself.
<br> 
<br> Ward noticed that he was somewhat constrained in his manner, nor was he displeased to see it. For was not Jack the one who had obtained Mike's key? And while he might not be the one who had wrought the mischief in his room, still he was so thoroughly satisfied in his own mind that Jack was aware of what was going on and had lent his influence to further it, that it was with something of a feeling of satisfaction he noted the evident uneasiness of his visitor.
<br> 
<br> "The way of it is this," said Jack, breaking in upon the awkward silence. "We need you on the nine, Ward, there's no mistake about that. If we are going to have any show against the Burrs this fall, we've just got to have your help. There's no mistake about that, and that's what I've come over to talk with you about."
<br> 
<br> "Did Tim Pickard send you?" asked Ward, making no effort to conceal the sneer on his face.
<br> 
<br> "No," said Jack quietly, "and that's where the mischief comes in. There's no doubt that Tim's down on you, Ward. You don't need me to tell you that."
<br> 
<br> "Hardly."
<br> 
<br> "But Tim isn't the whole of the Weston school. It's true he's got a lot of the fellows under his thumb and they'll do just what he tells them to. That's the way he succeeded in shutting you off from the nine. He pretended to call a meeting, but he never told Henry here nor me about it. He claims he had a majority there and that they voted not to have you on the nine this fall. He couldn't have done it if we'd been there, and Tim knows it too."
<br> 
<br> Ward still made no reply save to glance at Jack, who was now talking eagerly and apparently had overcome his recent feeling of embarrassment.
<br> 
<br> "Henry and I have been talking it over," continued Jack, "and we've about decided that we've found a way out, and that's what I came over especially to explain. Now, Ward, if you'll go in with us I think we'll have it fixed up in no time."
<br> 
<br> "I can't go in when I don't know what it is you want me to go into."
<br> 
<br> "It's this, Ward. Henry and I have decided that we sha'n't play on the nine unless you are taken on too."
<br> 
<br> "What?" said Ward abruptly.
<br> 
<br> He could hardly believe the words he had just heard. That Jack, who had taken Professor Mike's key, and who plainly must be aware of the troubles which were besetting him now on every side, should be the one to make such a proposition as that to which he had just listened seemed to Ward almost incredible. It would completely change every plan in his mind if Jack meant what he had said, and so far as appearances went, the boy seemed to be thoroughly in earnest.
<br> 
<br> "Yes," said Jack, "that's just what I mean. I don't believe that even Tim would care to lose both Henry and me just now, for he'd know he'd have the whole school down on him at once. It's bad enough to lose you, and there are a lot of the fellows who don't like it a little bit. Tim knows it, but he won't let on. Now, if Henry and I just quit too, it'll place Tim in a box too tight even for him."
<br> 
<br> "Then your plan is to force Tim to take me on the nine by threatening to leave yourselves if he doesn't, is it?" said Ward slowly.
<br> 
<br> "That's it, that's it," said Jack eagerly. "He'll have to come to time then."
<br> 
<br> "Well, I don't think I shall do it," said Ward deliberately. "Not that I shouldn't like to play on the nine. I'm not foolish enough to deny that, for I should, of course; but I don't care to force myself in where I'm not wanted."
<br> 
<br> "That isn't it, Ward," said Jack still more eagerly. "You are wanted--that is, nearly every fellow in the school wants you except Tim Pickard. Now, the question is whether you're going to let one fellow like Tim stand against the whole school. Why, I think even Luscious will go into the scheme and help squeeze Tim."
<br> 
<br> Ward felt that in spite of all his efforts his heart was becoming softer. Always susceptible to praise, the words of Jack were like balm to his troubled soul. He longed, far more than any one knew, to be at peace with the boys, and if once he were restored to his position on the nine, he felt confident he could easily regain his popularity.
<br> 
<br> But his anger at Tim was still strong, though Jack puzzled him sadly. Could it be that he had a share in the schemes which were then afoot? The mystery of the stolen key certainly indicated something of the kind, and yet with all his faults Jack Hobart would not lie, Ward felt assured of that. The thought of Jack's honesty suddenly brought Ward to a quick determination. He would speak to him without reserve of his troubles and see how he received his words.
<br> 
<br> "Jack," he said abruptly, "did you know that we'd had our room stacked almost every day since we came back to Weston?"
<br> 
<br> "No," said Jack in genuine surprise; "I didn't know a thing about it. You've kept it to yourself pretty well, not even to mention it to me."
<br> 
<br> "Well, it's been stacked, that's sure. I think we've spent more time tacking down our carpet and setting up our beds than we have in studying; haven't we, Henry?"
<br> 
<br> Henry glanced up in surprise that Ward should mention their trouble, but he smiled and nodded his head by way of reply, though he did not speak.
<br> 
<br> "Ward, that's tough," said Jack soberly. "I'm sorry you didn't tell me about it, for maybe I could have helped you. Have you any idea who it is that's doing it?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes," said Ward sharply; "but I'm only waiting for positive proof, and I think I'm close on to the track of that. One thing I've found out for sure, and that's some help."
<br> 
<br> "What's that?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, nothing much. Only that Mike has lost two of his keys and we know who took them. It wasn't very much of a trick to find that out, you know." Ward spoke quietly, but he was watching keenly to see what the effect of his words upon Jack would be.
<br> 
<br> Suddenly Jack looked up and his face flushed deeply. "Ward," said he, "was that the reason you asked me the other day if I had borrowed Mike's bunch of keys?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes," said Ward quietly.
<br> 
<br> "Well, old fellow, I don't know what I can say, if you really think I'd do such a thing. I did ask for the loan of the keys, that's a fact, but I didn't use them myself." Jack acted as if he were about to say more, but hesitated and became silent.
<br> 
<br> Ward was puzzled and his manner clearly betrayed the fact. The silence in the room was decidedly awkward for all concerned, and the boys shifted uneasily in their seats.
<br> 
<br> Jack was the first to speak, as he said: "It looks queer, I know, Ward, but I don't want to tell you who took the keys. There's something crooked, and I'm going to help you out of the scrape if I can. I'd tell you in a minute, I would honestly, who took the keys from me, but I am just sure he didn't stack your room. But I'll help you find out and I'll help you straighten out the fellow too."
<br> 
<br> "I think the 'Tangs' may have had something to do with it," said Ward.
<br> 
<br> It was the first time the name of the secret organization had been mentioned since he had left school at the close of the preceding year. Somehow it had been a tabooed subject and neither had referred to it in their letters or conversation. Jack had considered it a subject on which Ward might be somewhat sensitive, and Ward had been uncertain as to what Jack's plans would be.
<br> 
<br> "What makes you think the 'Tangs' had anything to do with it?" said Jack, after a pause of a moment, in which the uneasiness of the boys was still marked.
<br> 
<br> "Because I received one of their gentle little epistles before this trouble began."
<br> 
<br> "I haven't heard a word of the 'Tangs' since I came back to school," said Jack thoughtfully. "I didn't know they'd started up again, and I'm sure I hoped the thing was dead. It is dead so far as I'm concerned, for I've washed my hands of the whole business. I told Tim so before I came back to school, and if he knows when he's well off he'll let it alone too. He's got enough to do to keep himself straight with the faculty without going into the 'Tangs' again. But, Ward, I mean just what I say; I'm going to take off my coat and help you to find out about this matter, and if we once catch the fellow we'll give him a dose that'll cure him, I know."
<br> 
<br> "Thank you."
<br> 
<br> "You don't appear to be very enthusiastic," said Jack quietly.
<br> 
<br> It was evident that he was hurt by Ward's apparent lack of confidence in him; but his affection for his friend was so genuine and strong that he plainly was not to be put off by any of Ward's rebuffs.
<br> 
<br> "We'll talk about that later," said Jack as he rose to depart. "What I want to know now is whether you'll come down on the ball-ground to-morrow afternoon, and then Henry and I'll speak our little piece to Tim and we'll have it out. Tim'll give in, I know he will, for he isn't over happy as it is. He knows how a good many of the fellows feel, and besides that he wants the nine strengthened."
<br> 
<br> "I can't do it, Speck," said Ward at last, using the familiar nickname by which he had been accustomed to call his friend, for the first time in several days. "It's mighty good of you; but, you see, I just couldn't go on the nine in any such way as that."
<br> 
<br> "Then Henry and I'll quit too," said Jack emphatically.
<br> 
<br> "No, you won't. That would certainly spoil it all. I want you both to keep right on. There's no necessity for you to give up because I can't go in, and besides I've something else in mind just now, and if you both leave it'll spoil it all. I couldn't come down to-morrow, anyway, for I've planned to go and spend the afternoon up at the glen. Honest, Speck, I do thank you for your offer. It's mighty good of you, but I don't want you to do it yet, anyway. Maybe a little later I'll come in, but not just yet."
<br> 
<br> "All right, Ward. Have it your own way. You always do, somehow. Well, I must go over and see how Luscious is making out. He's a fine fellow, Luscious is, and he's going to push you for the valedic, as sure's you live."
<br> 
<br> "He's a good worker; any one can see that," said Ward as Jack departed.
<br> 
<br> "The plot thickens," he added turning to Henry. "For the life of me I can't see the way out as yet."
<br> 
<br> "I feel sure of one thing," said Henry, "and that is, that Jack's had nothing to do with it."
<br> 
<br> "I hope you're right," replied Ward thoughtfully; "but it's strange about those keys."
<br> 
<br> "Yes; but Jack can explain it, and he will before long."
<br> 
<br> Ward then explained the plan he had formed with Little Pond, and Henry agreed with him that it would be better for him and Jack to go down to the ball-ground, in view of what Ward had it in mind to do, and to appear as if they were not suspicious of any one or of any thing.
<br> 
<br> Accordingly, on the following afternoon Ward started out with Big Smith for a tramp to the glen, one of the favorite resorts of the Weston boys. He had taken pains to speak of his intended absence in the hearing of several of the boys of whom he had felt somewhat suspicious, and after having conferred with Little Pond, who promised to observe all his directions, the two boys departed from West Hall.
<br> 
<br> Ward's heart was much lighter than it had been for several days now. Puzzled as he was over Jack's part in the affair, the evident affection he had recently displayed led Ward to believe that still he was not entirely without friends. Even Big Smith was not to be despised, and Ward was surprised to observe the many changes which had come over the strange lad. His assumption had not entirely disappeared, and his former complete ignorance that there was any one else in the world of quite as much importance as he, was not yet all gone. But Big Smith was learning some of the lessons which in another form Ward Hill himself was also compelled to learn.
<br> 
<br> That morning Doctor Gray in his chapel talk had referred to the story of Wellington, when at one time he had visited the great English school at Eton, and after watching the eager crowd of boys in their struggles and games, had said, "Here Waterloo was won."
<br> 
<br> Ward was thinking of the words all that afternoon. If Wellington had really won the victory of Waterloo at Eton, then Napoleon must have lost it under similar conditions, he thought, and he wondered whether Weston might not be solving some such problems also. As for himself, Ward Hill fully appreciated the fact that he was in the midst of a struggle, and to the lad's credit be it said, out of it all came a stronger determination that his battle should not be lost.
<br> 
<br> He had enjoyed the afternoon thoroughly, and when he returned he ran eagerly up to Little Pond's room to learn whether he had discovered anything or not.
<br> 
<br> "Yes," said Pond, "I've found out some things. Come in and I'll tell you all about it."
<br> 
<br> Ward eagerly followed his little friend into his room, and taking a seat, turned to listen to what Pond had to tell him.
