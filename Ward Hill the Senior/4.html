CRANE'S EXAMINATION
<br> 
<br> Along with all the excitement attending the return of the boys to the school there was a feeling of depression in Ward's heart which he could not entirely shake off. The walls of the room seemed more bare than they did in the preceding year, and the undefined dread of meeting his former companions pressed heavily upon him, now that he found himself once more in the old familiar place and under the necessity of facing not only them but himself as well.
<br> 
<br> The cloud which had rested upon him when he left Weston, while it had never disappeared, had nevertheless been somewhat dim and hazy when he had been away from it all, and had had the presence of his father and mother to strengthen him; but now he was alone, and all his former feelings returned. How long it would be before he would see Rockford again! And what experiences were likely to be his before the fall term was ended.
<br> 
<br> Heavy as his heart was, however, Ward did not refer to his feelings, but busied himself in arranging the few articles of furniture which comprised their possessions, and soon the room took on its old and familiar appearance. Up the stairs and through the halls the other boys were rushing, and the sound of the heavy trunks as they were deposited in the rooms could be continually heard. Their own door was closed and no one entered to disturb them, a fact over which Ward secretly rejoiced, for he was dreading far more than he cared to express, his first meeting with his fellows.
<br> 
<br> "There," said Henry at last, "I don't see that we can do anything more to-night. I think we'd better go over and report to the doctor now, don't you?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes," said Ward gloomily. "It's got to be done, and the sooner it's over the better."
<br> 
<br> Henry glanced keenly at his friend, but made no further response, and in a few moments the boys left West Hall and went over to Dr. Gray's house. The reception room seemed to be almost filled with boys and their parents, and Ward was surprised as he noted that many were evidently new-comers.
<br> 
<br> As he took his seat he busied himself for a time in carefully observing his companions and it was not long before he had satisfied himself that among the new arrivals he would find some who would be congenial to himself. His thoughts and observations were both interrupted by the entrance of the principal, who at once advanced and shook the hands of Ward and Henry, and after they had delivered the letter they had brought, they quickly departed.
<br> 
<br> As they came out again into the broad, shaded street, Ward determined to carry out a plan he had formed, which was nothing less than to seek out Mr. Crane at once, and ascertain when his examination upon the work in which he had failed was to take place. He said nothing concerning it to Henry, however, and merely remarking that he would soon be back in the room, turned and abruptly left his chum.
<br> 
<br> As he walked slowly over toward East Hall, the building over which Mr. Crane had charge and in which he had his room, his feeling of anxiety increased. Perhaps after all he would be unable to pass his examination. He had worked faithfully all summer long and had felt confident when he left home that he could easily make up the lost work, but now that the testing time had come all his fears returned. There was one thing certain any way, he thought, and that was if he should succeed in passing Mr. Crane's tests now, never again would he be found in such a predicament. He thought again of the teacher's words about its being so much more easy to keep up than to catch up.
<br> 
<br> "He's right," said Ward aloud. "He's right. He always is. I almost wish Mr. Crane would let me room with him. I think I could do right there so much more easily."
<br> 
<br> He smiled as he thought of the suggestion and realized how absurd it was. After all, if he could room with the man whom he so highly respected and loved, would he be any better for it? It would be Mr. Crane's "right" and not his. No, he must brace himself to meet his problems himself. Ward Hill's future lay in Ward Hill's hands.
<br> 
<br> Just then he came around the bend in the path and East Hall was right before him. From every window a light was streaming, and it was evident that there was to be no lack of boys at Weston this year. Now and then a burst of laughter could be heard, and occasionally the words of a song rose on the still air. The building seemed to be teeming with life and spirits, and somehow in the presence of it all Ward felt a wave of lonesomeness sweeping over him. The East Hall boys all had good rooms, plenty of money, and no lack of friends. His own room seemed to him bare and chill; money he knew he must use sparingly; and as for friends, he did not know whether any besides Jack and Henry were left for him among the boys of the Weston school.
<br> 
<br> He was now by the stone steps which led up to the first hall, and Mr. Crane's room was the first one on the left. Summoning all his courage, Ward resolutely approached the door and rapped.
<br> 
<br> It was opened by Mr. Crane himself, and as he quickly recognized the lad standing before him, he held forth his hand and said cordially: "Why, Hill, I'm delighted to see you. Come in."
<br> 
<br> Ward entered and seated himself in the chair indicated by his teacher. He was in almost the very same place where he had been ten weeks before, and all the memories of that scene came pressing back upon him. The recollection was not over-pleasing, and the troubled boy was hardly able to speak. He had thought many times of the very words he would use when he first saw Mr. Crane again, but they were gone from him now.
<br> 
<br> Mr. Crane, apparently not noticing Ward's embarrassment, began to speak of the experiences of the summer.
<br> 
<br> "I took a long tramp among the Northern hills," he said. "It was a thoroughly enjoyable experience to me. I was alone the most of the time, and more than once I wished that you were with me. I think you would have enjoyed it, and I knew that I did."
<br> 
<br> Ward listened as Mr. Crane went on with his descriptions, and for a moment almost forgot the purpose of his visit. Soon it all came back, however, and unable to restrain himself longer, he broke out with the words:
<br> 
<br> "I know I should have enjoyed it, Mr. Crane, but I didn't have just that kind of a summer. I spent every forenoon in going over my work. I only had two days off all summer long, and yet I've not felt so bad as I thought I should. At least I don't now, for I think I can pass up on my examinations; that is, if they're no harder than those you gave at the end of the year."
<br> 
<br> "They'll be no harder," replied Mr. Crane, with a smile. "Now tell me about the work you've done."
<br> 
<br> And Ward entered into a detailed account of all the studying he had done during the summer vacation.
<br> 
<br> Mr. Crane listened attentively, occasionally interrupting to ask some question that occurred to him, and at last when the troubled lad had finished his story, he quietly said:
<br> 
<br> "And now you think that you can pass any examination I can give you on the work?"
<br> 
<br> "Hardly that," said Ward quickly; "but I do think, Mr. Crane, that I can pass any examination which isn't any tougher--I mean harder--than the one you gave the class last June."
<br> 
<br> "Very well, Hill, I shall take your word for it. You ought to know as much about it as any one, and if you think you understand the work, I'm satisfied."
<br> 
<br> "I don't understand you," faltered Ward. "What do you mean?"
<br> 
<br> "Just what I said, Hill. All I want of an examination is to satisfy myself that a boy can go on with his class. From what you have told me of your studying, and from what I know of you, I am satisfied you can do that, and that is all I want. Of course I shall expect good work from you, Hill, and you'll not disappoint me."
<br> 
<br> "Why, Mr. Crane," said Ward starting up from his seat. "And I'm not to take an examination? Is that what you mean?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes."
<br> 
<br> "I never expected anything like that," said Ward much moved. "I can't tell you how much I thank you, Mr. Crane. It's not that I'm afraid of the examination," he added hastily, "but I never even dreamed of your doing any such thing."
<br> 
<br> "I trust you are not too much disappointed. If you are, I can very readily arrange to meet your wishes," replied Mr. Crane smilingly. "I've told you, however, just how I feel about it, and if I'm content, why, it seems to me you ought to be."
<br> 
<br> "I am! I am!" said Ward hastily, as he bade Mr. Crane good-night and departed for his room in West Hall.
<br> 
<br> How different everything appeared now! The very stars in the heavens seemed to share in his joy. The songs and laughter that came through the open windows of the great dormitory behind him now seemed to voice his own feelings. In his eagerness he began to run and as he entered West Hall he mounted the steps two at a time and burst into his room.
<br> 
<br> "Oh, Henry----"
<br> 
<br> He suddenly stopped as he saw that there were three boys besides Henry in the room. One was Jack, and in a moment that impulsive lad was welcoming him.
<br> 
<br> "I say, Ward," said Jack, "I'm just in. I didn't stop over in East Hall longer than to leave my grip before I put straight for your room. Behold, I looked for you and you were not. You've been looking me up, I know. That's just what you've been doing. I don't believe I'd have come back to Weston if you hadn't come!"
<br> 
<br> "I've been over to see Mr. Crane and fix up my conditions," said Ward.
<br> 
<br> "Got 'em all fixed?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, every one."
<br> 
<br> "Good for you, Ward! Good for you! Oh, I say, I haven't introduced the new fellows to, you. This," he added turning to a well-grown lad, evidently of about their own age, "this is Lucius Berry. He's going to enter our class, and from what I hear he's going to make you hustle to get the valedic."
<br> 
<br> Ward greeted the new member of the class cordially, and then Jack said, "This is Pond's baby brother."
<br> 
<br> The lad flushed at Jack's words, and Ward hastened to take him by the hand and assure him of a warm welcome. He was a slight, delicate boy, and while he bore a striking resemblance to his older brother, of whom almost every boy in the Weston school was very fond, it was also evident that he was not nearly so strong and well as he. Ward wondered that he should ever have been permitted to leave home, and as he thought of the experiences through which the sensitive lad was bound to pass if he remained through the year, his own heart went out to him and he resolved that so far as it lay within his power he would do his utmost for him.
<br> 
<br> For a half-hour the boys sat and talked together. The prospects of the nine, the new members of the school, the rooms they were to have, were all gone over, and Ward in the new joy which had come to him at Mr. Crane's words was thoroughly happy.
<br> 
<br> "Little Pond," as Pond's younger brother was at once dubbed, explained that his brother expected to return at the opening of the following term and that meanwhile he was working in the home village store to secure the means.
<br> 
<br> "He's got the best kind of stuff in him!" said Jack enthusiastically. "Talk about money giving a fellow his place in the Weston school! Why, Pond's the most popular boy that's been here in years. I think I'd be glad to change places with him myself, that is, if he'd give me his brains in the bargain. Just imagine me if you can, calling out, 'Yes, this calico is five cents a yard. Those eggs are fresh, for Mrs. Green brought them, and she never has any but the best, you know. Clothespins? Yes, I think we have a few, and I'll measure you off a few yards of this cotton cloth if you say the word.'"
<br> 
<br> The boys all laughed as Jack went through the motions as if he were a clerk in a country store and were measuring off the goods some good woman had decided to purchase. "But I say, fellows, it's hard for the nine, though, with Pond gone. But Berry here is a good player. He was the captain of the nine in the school he came from before he learned of the advantages of the Weston school. There only can you find such fellows as Jack Hobart and Ward Hill, and such teachers as Blake and Big Smith, for I'm of the opinion that Dr. Gray will call Big Smith into the faculty this fall. He'll have to do it, or Big Smith will fire the doctor."
<br> 
<br> Jack thrust his thumbs into his hip pockets and strutted about the room as he talked, and to Ward his manner and bearing seemed irresistibly droll. But then, Ward Hill was in a mood to enjoy almost anything that night.
<br> 
<br> "I say, Berry," said Jack stopping suddenly before the new boy, "your name's Lucius, isn't it?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes," replied Berry. "I've told you so once or twice already."
<br> 
<br> "So you have. So you have," said Jack. "But somehow, I forget so easily. Why, I've actually been known to forget the case and gender of a noun in Mr. Crane's class, haven't I, Ward? Lucius, Lucius," he added as if he were puzzled by the name. "I have it now. You shall be no more Lucius. From this time forth your name shall be Luscious. Luscious Berry! Oh, what a name!"
<br> 
<br> All the boys laughed heartily at Berry's new name, Berry himself joined good-naturedly in the laugh as he said: "I thought I'd shaken that name off when I came to Weston. It's the very same name they gave me in the other school."
<br> 
<br> "Jack," said Ward suddenly, "has Tim Pickard come back?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes," said Jack, sobered in a moment. "Yes, Tim's here. He's going to room alone at Ma Perrins', you know, this year."
<br> 
<br> Ward's face clouded and he knew from the change in Jack's manner that something was wrong, though he could not determine just what it was. The fun, however, was gone, and in a few minutes Jack rose and said: "Come on, Luscious, we'll have to go over to our room. He's to room with me, you know," he added turning to Ward. "He's come all properly recommended and all that sort of thing, so I've agreed to take him in. Good-night, Henry. Good-night, Puddle--a little Pond's a puddle, isn't it? Good-night, Ward. Your vertebrae are in their proper tension I hope, and your upper lip is sufficiently rigid, my dear young friend, I trust."
<br> 
<br> The boys were gone, but Jack's last words were not lost upon Ward. He understood his friend so well that he was satisfied Jack knew of some coming trial for him. And Ward tried to prepare himself for the trouble which he feared was soon coming, although he had slight conception that night of how soon it was to come.
