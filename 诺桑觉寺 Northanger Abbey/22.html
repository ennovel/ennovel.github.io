Instantaneously, with the consciousness of existence, returned her recollection of the manuscript; and springing from the bed in the very moment of the maid's going away, she eagerly collected every scattered sheet which had burst from the roll on its falling to the ground, and flew back to enjoy the luxury of their perusal on her pillow. She now plainly saw that she must not expect a manuscript of equal length with the generality of what she had shuddered over in books, for the roll, seeming to consist entirely of small disjointed sheets, was altogether but of trifling size, and much less than she had supposed it to be at first.</p> 
<p>Her greedy eye glanced rapidly over a page. She started at its import. Could it be possible, or did not her senses play her false? An inventory of linen, in coarse and modern characters, seemed all that was before her! If the evidence of sight might be trusted, she held a washing-bill in her hand. She seized another sheet, and saw the same articles with little variation; a third, a fourth, and a fifth presented nothing new. Shirts, stockings, cravats, and waistcoats faced her in each. Two others, penned by the same hand, marked an expenditure scarcely more interesting, in letters, hair-powder, shoe-string, and breeches-ball. And the larger sheet, which had enclosed the rest, seemed by its first cramp line, "To poultice chestnut mare" -- a farrier's bill! Such was the collection of papers (left perhaps, as she could then suppose, by the negligence of a servant in the place whence she had taken them) which had filled her with expectation and alarm, and robbed her of half her night's rest! She felt humbled to the dust. Could not the adventure of the chest have taught her wisdom? A corner of it, catching her eye as she lay, seemed to rise up in judgment against her. Nothing could now be clearer than the absurdity of her recent fancies. To suppose that a manuscript of many generations back could have remained undiscovered in a room such as that, so modern, so habitable! -- Or that she should be the first to possess the skill of unlocking a cabinet, the key of which was open to all!</p> 
<p>How could she have so imposed on herself? Heaven forbid that Henry Tilney should ever know her folly! And it was in a great measure his own doing, for had not the cabinet appeared so exactly to agree with his description of her adventures, she should never have felt the smallest curiosity about it. This was the only comfort that occurred. Impatient to get rid of those hateful evidences of her folly, those detestable papers then scattered over the bed, she rose directly, and folding them up as nearly as possible in the same shape as before, returned them to the same spot within the cabinet, with a very hearty wish that no untoward accident might ever bring them forward again, to disgrace her even with herself.</p> 
<p>Why the locks should have been so difficult to open, however, was still something remarkable, for she could now manage them with perfect ease. In this there was surely something mysterious, and she indulged in the flattering suggestion for half a minute, till the possibility of the door's having been at first unlocked, and of being herself its fastener, darted into her head, and cost her another blush.</p> 
<p>She got away as soon as she could from a room in which her conduct produced such unpleasant reflections, and found her way with all speed to the breakfast-parlour, as it had been pointed out to her by Miss Tilney the evening before. Henry was alone in it; and his immediate hope of her having been undisturbed by the tempest, with an arch reference to the character of the building they inhabited, was rather distressing. For the world would she not have her weakness suspected, and yet, unequal to an absolute falsehood, was constrained to acknowledge that the wind had kept her awake a little. "But we have a charming morning after it," she added, desiring to get rid of the subject; "and storms and sleeplessness are nothing when they are over. What beautiful hyacinths! I have just learnt to love a hyacinth."</p> 
<p>"And how might you learn? By accident or argument?"</p> 
<p>"Your sister taught me; I cannot tell how. Mrs. Allen used to take pains, year after year, to make me like them; but I never could, till I saw them the other day in Milsom Street; I am naturally indifferent about flowers."</p> 
<p>"But now you love a hyacinth. So much the better. You have gained a new source of enjoyment, and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible. Besides, a taste for flowers is always desirable in your sex, as a means of getting you out of doors, and tempting you to more frequent exercise than you would otherwise take. And though the love of a hyacinth may be rather domestic, who can tell, the sentiment once raised, but you may in time come to love a rose?"</p> 
<p>"But I do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors. The pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me, and in fine weather I am out more than half my time. Mamma says I am never within."</p> 
<p>"At any rate, however, I am pleased that you have learnt to love a hyacinth. The mere habit of learning to love is the thing; and a teachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing. Has my sister a pleasant mode of instruction?"</p> 
<p>Catherine was saved the embarrassment of attempting an answer by the entrance of the general, whose smiling compliments announced a happy state of mind, but whose gentle hint of sympathetic early rising did not advance her composure.</p> 
<p>The elegance of the breakfast set forced itself on Catherine's notice when they were seated at table; and, lucidly, it had been the general's choice. He was enchanted by her approbation of his taste, confessed it to be neat and simple, thought it right to encourage the manufacture of his country; and for his part, to his uncritical palate, the tea was as well flavoured from the clay of Staffordshire, as from that of Dresden or Save. But this was quite an old set, purchased two years ago. The manufacture was much improved since that time; he had seen some beautiful specimens when last in town, and had he not been perfectly without vanity of that kind, might have been tempted to order a new set. He trusted, however, that an opportunity might ere long occur of selecting one -- though not for himself. Catherine was probably the only one of the party who did not understand him.</p> 
<p>Shortly after breakfast Henry left them for Woodston, where business required and would keep him two or three days. They all attended in the hall to see him mount his horse, and immediately on re-entering the breakfast-room, Catherine walked to a window in the hope of catching another glimpse of his figure. "This is a somewhat heavy call upon your brother's fortitude," observed the general to Eleanor. "Woodston will make but a sombre appearance today."</p> 
<p>"Is it a pretty place?" asked Catherine.</p> 
<p>"What say you, Eleanor? Speak your opinion, for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men. I think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations. The house stands among fine meadows facing the south-east, with an excellent kitchen-garden in the same aspect; the walls surrounding which I built and stocked myself about ten years ago, for the benefit of my son. It is a family living, Miss Morland; and the property in the place being chiefly my own, you may believe I take care that it shall not be a bad one. Did Henry's income depend solely on this living, he would not be ill-provided for. Perhaps it may seem odd, that with only two younger children, I should think any profession necessary for him; and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business. But though I may not exactly make converts of you young ladies, I am sure your father, Miss Morland, would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment. The money is nothing, it is not an object, but employment is the thing. Even Frederick, my eldest son, you see, who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county, has his profession."</p> 
<p>The imposing effect of this last argument was equal to his wishes. The silence of the lady proved it to be unanswerable.</p> 
<p>Something had been said the evening before of her being shown over the house, and he now offered himself as her conductor; and though Catherine had hoped to explore it accompanied only by his daughter, it was a proposal of too much happiness in itself, under any circumstances, not to be gladly accepted; for she had been already eighteen hours in the abbey, and had seen only a few of its rooms. The netting-box, just leisurely drawn forth, was closed with joyful haste, and she was ready to attend him in a moment. "And when they had gone over the house, he promised himself moreover the pleasure of accompanying her into the shrubberies and garden." She curtsied her acquiescence. "But perhaps it might be more agreeable to her to make those her first object. The weather was at present favourable, and at this time of year the uncertainty was very great of its continuing so. Which would she prefer? He was equally at her service. Which did his daughter think would most accord with her fair friend's wishes? But he thought he could discern. Yes, he certainly read in Miss Morland's eyes a judicious desire of making use of the present smiling weather. But when did she judge amiss? The abbey would be always safe and dry. He yielded implicitly, and would fetch his hat and attend them in a moment." He left the room, and Catherine, with a disappointed, anxious face, began to speak of her unwillingness that he should be taking them out of doors against his own inclination, under a mistaken idea of pleasing her; but she was stopped by Miss Tilney's saying, with a little confusion, "I believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine; and do not be uneasy on my father's account; he always walks out at this time of day."</p> 
<p>Catherine did not exactly know how this was to be understood. Why was Miss Tilney embarrassed? Could there be any unwillingness on the general's side to show her over the abbey? The proposal was his own. And was not it odd that he should always take his walk so early? Neither her father nor Mr. Allen did so. It was certainly very provoking. She was all impatience to see the house, and had scarcely any curiosity about the grounds. If Henry had been with them indeed! But now she should not know what was picturesque when she saw it. Such were her thoughts, but she kept them to herself, and put on her bonnet in patient discontent.</p> 
<p>She was struck, however, beyond her expectation, by the grandeur of the abbey, as she saw it for the first time from the lawn. The whole building enclosed a large court; and two sides of the quadrangle, rich in Gothic ornaments, stood forward for admiration. The remainder was shut off by knolls of old trees, or luxuriant plantations, and the steep woody hills rising behind, to give it shelter, were beautiful even in the leafless month of March. Catherine had seen nothing to compare with it; and her feelings of delight were so strong, that without waiting for any better authority, she boldly burst forth in wonder and praise. The general listened with assenting gratitude; and it seemed as if his own estimation of Northanger had waited unfixed till that hour.</p> 
<p>The kitchen-garden was to be next admired, and he led the way to it across a small portion of the park.</p> 
<p>The number of acres contained in this garden was such as Catherine could not listen to without dismay, being more than double the extent of all Mr. Allen's, as well her father's, including church-yard and orchard. The walls seemed countless in number, endless in length; a village of hot-houses seemed to arise among them, and a whole parish to be at work within the enclosure. The general was flattered by her looks of surprise, which told him almost as plainly, as he soon forced her to tell him in words, that she had never seen any gardens at all equal to them before; and he then modestly owned that, "without any ambition of that sort himself -- without any solicitude about it -- he did believe them to be unrivalled in the kingdom. If he had a hobby-horse, it was that. He loved a garden. Though careless enough in most matters of eating, he loved good fruit -- or if he did not, his friends and children did. There were great vexations, however, attending such a garden as his. The utmost care could not always secure the most valuable fruits. The pinery had yielded only one hundred in the last year. Mr. Allen, he supposed, must feel these inconveniences as well as himself."</p> 
<p>"No, not at all. Mr. Allen did not care about the garden, and never went into it."</p> 
<p>With a triumphant smile of self-satisfaction, the general wished he could do the same, for he never entered his, without being vexed in some way or other, by its falling short of his plan.</p> 
<p>"How were Mr. Allen's succession-houses worked?" describing the nature of his own as they entered them.</p> 
<p>"Mr. Allen had only one small hot-house, which Mrs. Allen had the use of for her plants in winter, and there was a fire in it now and then."</p> 
<p>"He is a happy man!" said the general, with a look of very happy contempt.</p> 
<p>Having taken her into every division, and led her under every wall, till she was heartily weary of seeing and wondering, he suffered the girls at last to seize the advantage of an outer door, and then expressing his wish to examine the effect of some recent alterations about the tea-house, proposed it as no unpleasant extension of their walk, if Miss Morland were not tired. "But where are you going, Eleanor? Why do you choose that cold, damp path to it? Miss Morland will get wet. Our best way is across the park."</p> 
<p>"This is so favourite a walk of mine," said Miss Tilney, "that I always think it the best and nearest way. But perhaps it may be damp."</p> 
<p>It was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old Scotch firs; and Catherine, struck by its gloomy aspect, and eager to enter it, could not, even by the general's disapprobation, be kept from stepping forward. He perceived her inclination, and having again urged the plea of health in vain, was too polite to make further opposition. He excused himself, however, from attending them: "The rays of the sun were not too cheerful for him, and he would meet them by another course." He turned away; and Catherine was shocked to find how much her spirits were relieved by the separation. The shock, however, being less real than the relief, offered it no injury; and she began to talk with easy gaiety of the delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired.</p> 
<p>"I am particularly fond of this spot," said her companion, with a sigh. "It was my mother's favourite walk."</p> 
<p>Catherine had never heard Mrs. Tilney mentioned in the family before, and the interest excited by this tender remembrance showed itself directly in her altered countenance, and in the attentive pause with which she waited for something more.</p> 
<p>"I used to walk here so often with her!" added Eleanor; "though I never loved it then, as I have loved it since. At that time indeed I used to wonder at her choice. But her memory endears it now."</p> 
<p>"And ought it not," reflected Catherine, "to endear it to her husband? Yet the general would not enter it." Miss Tilney continuing silent, she ventured to say, "Her death must have been a great affliction!"</p> 
<p>"A great and increasing one," replied the other, in a low voice. "I was only thirteen when it happened; and though I felt my loss perhaps as strongly as one so young could feel it, I did not, I could not, then know what a loss it was." She stopped for a moment, and then added, with great firmness, "I have no sister, you know -- and though Henry -- though my brothers are very affectionate, and Henry is a great deal here, which I am most thankful for, it is impossible for me not to be often solitary."</p> 
<p>"To be sure you must miss him very much."</p> 
<p>"A mother would have been always present. A mother would have been a constant friend; her influence would have been beyond all other."</p> 
<p>"Was she a very charming woman? Was she handsome? Was there any picture of her in the abbey? And why had she been so partial to that grove? Was it from dejection of spirits?" -- were questions now eagerly poured forth; the first three received a ready affirmative, the two others were passed by; and Catherine's interest in the deceased Mrs. Tilney augmented with every question, whether answered or not. Of her unhappiness in marriage, she felt persuaded. The general certainly had been an unkind husband. He did not love her walk: could he therefore have loved her? And besides, handsome as he was, there was a something in the turn of his features which spoke his not having behaved well to her.</p> 
<p>"Her picture, I suppose," blushing at the consummate art of her own question, "hangs in your father's room?"</p> 
<p>"No; it was intended for the drawing-room; but my father was dissatisfied with the painting, and for some time it had no place. Soon after her death I obtained it for my own, and hung it in my bed-chamber -- where I shall be happy to show it you; it is very like." Here was another proof. A portrait -- very like -- of a departed wife, not valued by the husband! He must have been dreadfully cruel to her!</p> 
<p>Catherine attempted no longer to hide from herself the nature of the feelings which, in spite of all his attentions, he had previously excited; and what had been terror and dislike before, was now absolute aversion. Yes, aversion! His cruelty to such a charming woman made him odious to her. She had often read of such characters, characters which Mr. Allen had been used to call unnatural and overdrawn; but here was proof positive of the contrary.</p> 
<p>She had just settled this point when the end of the path brought them directly upon the general; and in spite of all her virtuous indignation, she found herself again obliged to walk with him, listen to him, and even to smile when he smiled. Being no longer able, however, to receive pleasure from the surrounding objects, she soon began to walk with lassitude; the general perceived it, and with a concern for her health, which seemed to reproach her for her opinion of him, was most urgent for returning with his daughter to the house. He would follow them in a quarter of an hour. Again they parted -- but Eleanor was called back in half a minute to receive a strict charge against taking her friend round the abbey till his return. This second instance of his anxiety to delay what she so much wished for struck Catherine as very remarkable.</p> 
<p>第二天早晨八点．女仆进屋折百叶窗发出啊声，才把凯瑟琳吵醒。她一边纳闷自己怎么闭的眼，一边把眼睁开，见到了敞亮的景象。她的火炉已经生着，一夜风暴过后．早晨一片晴朗。就在她苏醒的瞬间，她想起了那份手稿。女仆一走，她便霍地跳下床，急火火地拣起纸卷掉地时散落的每一张纸片，然后飞也似地奔回床上，趴在枕头上津津有味地读了起来。她现在清清楚楚地发现，这篇手稿并不像她期望的那样，没有她通常战战兢兢地读过的那些书那么长，因为这卷纸看来全是些零零散散的小纸片，总共也没有多厚，比她当初想象的薄多了。</p> 
<p>她以贪婪的目光迅速扫视了一张，其内容使她大吃一惊。这可能吗？莫非是她的眼睛在欺骗她吧？呈现在她面前的似乎是一份衣物清单，潦潦草草的全是现代字体！如果她的眼睛还靠得住的话，她手里拿着一份洗衣帐单。她又抓起另一张，见到的还是那些东西，没有什么差别。她又抓起第三张、第四张、第五张，没有见到任何新鲜花样。每一张都是衬衫、长袜、领带和背心。还有两张，出自同一手笔，上面记载着一笔同样乏味的开销：邮资、</p> 
<p>发粉、鞋带、肥皂等。包在外面的那张大纸，一看那密密麻麻的第一行字：“给栗色骡马敷泥罨剂”，似乎是一份兽医的帐单！就是这样一堆纸（她这时可以料想，兴许是哪位仆人疏忽大意，放在她找到它们的地方），使她充满了期望和恐惧，害得她半夜没有合眼！她觉得羞愧极了。难道那只箱子的教训还不能使她学乖一些？她躺在床上，望见了箱子的一角，这个角仿佛也在起来责备她。她最近这些想象之荒诞，现在可以看得再清楚不过了。居然设想多少年代以前的一份手稿，放在如此现代，如此适于居住的房间里，而一直未被发现！那只钥匙明明谁都能用，她居然设想自己头一个掌握了开柜子的诀窍！</p> 
<p>她怎么能如此欺骗自己？这种傻事千万别让亨利·蒂尔尼知道！说起来，这件事多半怪他不好，假使那只柜子与他描绘她的奇遇时所说的模样不相吻合，她决不会对它感到一丝半点的好奇。这是她唯一感到的一点安慰。她迫不及待地想要清除她干傻事的那些可恨的痕迹，清除当时撒了一床的那些可憎的票据，于是她立刻爬起来，把票据一张张叠好，尽量叠成以前的样子，送回到柜中原来的地方，衷心祝愿别发生什么不幸再把它们端出来，让她自己都觉得没有脸面。</p> 
<p>然而，那两把锁起先为什么那样难开却依然有点蹊跷，因为她现在开起来易如反掌。这其中定有什么奥秘。她先是自鸣得意地沉思了半分钟，后来突然想到那柜门起初可能根本没锁，而是她自己给锁上的，不禁又臊红了脸。</p> 
<p>她想起自己在这房里的举动，觉得十分难堪，于是便趁早离开了这里。头天晚上，蒂尔尼小姐把早餐厅指给她看了，她以最快的速度找到了那里。早餐厅里只有亨利一个人。他一见面便说，希望夜里的风暴没吓着她，并且狡黠地谈起了他们这座房子的特性，这些话使凯瑟琳感到十分不安。她最怕别人怀疑自己懦弱，然而她又撒不出弥天大谎，便只得承认风刮得她有阵子睡不着。“不过，风雨过后，我们不是有个明媚的早晨吗？”她补充说道，一心想避开这个话题。“风暴和失眠都过去了，也就无所谓了。多好看的风信子啊！我最近才懂得喜爱风信子。”</p> 
<p>“你是怎么懂得的？是偶然的，还是被人说服的？”</p> 
<p>“跟你妹妹学的，我也说不上是怎么学的。艾伦太太曾经一年年地设法让我喜爱风信子，可我就是做不到，直到那天我在米尔萨街见到那些花。我天生不喜爱花。”</p> 
<p>“不过你现在爱上了风信子。这就更好了。你又增添了一种新的享乐来源，人的乐趣多多益善嘛。再说，女人爱花总是好事，可以使你们到户外来，引诱你们经常多活动活动，否则你们是不会这么做的。康说喜爱风信子还属于一种室内乐趣。但是一旦来了兴头，谁敢说你到时候不会爱上蔷薇花呢？”</p> 
<p>“可是我并不需要这样的爱好把我引出门。散散步，透透新鲜空气，这样的乐趣对我来说已经足够了。逢到天晴气朗，我有大半时间呆在户外。妈妈说我从不着家。”</p> 
<p>“不管怎么样，我很高兴你学会了喜爱风信子。能学会喜爱东西的习性本身就很了不起。年轻的小姐禀性好学，这是难能可贵的。我妹妹的指教方式还令人愉快吧？”</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳正窘迫得不知道如何回答是好，这时将军进来解救了她。他笑盈盈地向她问候，一看样子就知道他心情很愉快，但他温婉地暗示说他也赞成早起，这并没使凯瑟琳心里进一步平静下来。</p> 
<p>大家坐下吃饭时，那套精致的早餐餐具引起了凯瑟琳的注意。幸好，这都是将军亲自选择的、凯瑟琳对他的审美力表示赞赏，将军听了喜不自胜，老实承认这套餐具有些洁雅简朴，认为应该鼓励本国的制造业。他是个五味不辨的人，觉得用斯塔福德郡的茶壶彻出来的茶，和用德累斯顿或塞夫勒 的茶壶沏出来的茶没有什么差别。不过，这是一套旧餐具,</p> 
<p>还是两年前购置的。自打那时以来，工艺水平已有很大改进，他上回进城时，就见到一些别致的样品，他若不是因为一点也不爱慕虚荣的话，也许早就动心要订购一套新的了。不过他相信，她不久会有机会选购一套新的，尽管不是为他自已。在座的人里，大概只有凯瑟琳一个人没听懂他的话。</p> 
<p>吃过早饭不久，亨利便辞别众人到伍德斯顿去了，有事要在那里逗留三两天。大伙说来到门厅，看着他跨上马。凯瑟琳一回到早餐厅，便连忙走到窗口，希望再看一眼他的背影。“这回可真够你哥哥受的，”将军对埃丽诺说道，“伍德斯顿今天会显得阴阴沉沉的。”</p> 
<p>“那地方好吗？”凯瑟琳问道。</p> 
<p>“你说呢？埃丽诺？说说你的看法，因为说到女人对男人和地方的感受，还是女人最有发言权。我认为，拿最公正的眼光来看，你得承认伍德斯顿有许多可取之处。房子坐落在绿茵茵的草坪上，朝着东南方向，还有一块极好的菜园，也冲着东南。大约十年前，我为儿子着想，亲手垒起了围墙，种上了牧草。这是个家传的牧师职位。这一带的大部分田产都是我本人的，你尽可相信，我保证这是个不坏的职位。假使亨利仅仅依靠这笔牧师棒禄维生，他也不会感到拮据的。这看上去也许有点奇怪，我只有两个年纪较小的孩子，居然还要亨利去做事。当然，我们有时也都希望他能摆脱一切事务上的纠缠。不过，我虽说可能改变了你们年轻小姐的见解，但是我敢断定，莫兰小姐，你父亲会赞成我的看去，认为给每个年轻小伙子找点事干还是大有裨益的。钱倒无关紧要，那不是目的，重要的是有点事干。你瞧．就连我的长子弗雷德里克，他要继承的地产也许不比本郡的任何平民来得少，可他也有自己的职业。”这最后一个论据就像将军期望的那样，取得了显著的效果。莫兰小姐默默不语，证明这话是无可辩驳的。</p> 
<p>头天晚上说过，要领着客人在房里四处转转，现在将军自告奋勇，愿当向导。凯瑟琳本来只希望让蒂尔尼小姐领着她去看看的，可是这顶提议实在太让人高兴了，她无论如何也不会不乐于接受的，因为她来到诺桑觉寺已经十八个钟头了，才仅仅看了几个房间。她慢腾腾地刚把针线匣拉出来．现在又兴冲冲地急忙关上了，转眼间便准备好了要踉将军去。等把房子内部看完以后，将军还希望能陪她去矮树林和花园里走走。凯瑟琳行了个屈膝礼，表示默许。不过，她也许乐意先去矮树林和花园溜溜。眼下天气很好，每年这个时候，这脚气天气很难持久。她到底愿意先去哪儿？将军听凭她的吩咐。他女儿认为怎么样最适合她这位漂亮朋友的心意？不过，他觉得他能明察出来。是啊。他从莫兰小姐的眼神中可以看出一个明智的愿望：她想趁明媚的天气到外边走走。她的决定什么时候错过呢？寺院内部随时都能看，也不怕下雨。将军欣然同意了，这就去取帽子，马上陪她们去。他走出屋子，凯瑟琳带着失望、焦灼的神气，说起了她不愿意让将军勉为其难地带她们到户外去，还误以为这样会让她高兴。不想她的话被打断了，蒂尔尼小姐有点窘迫地说道；““上午天气这么好，我想出去走走是再明智不过了。不要为我父亲担忧，他每天总在这个时候出去散步。”</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳摸不清这是怎么回事。蒂尔尼小姐为什么发窘呢？莫非将军不愿带她参观寺院？可那建议是他提出来的。他总是这么早就出去散步，这岂不是很奇怪吗？她父亲和艾伦先生从不这么早去散步。这事真惹人烦恼。她急着要看房子，对庭园简直毫无兴趣。要是亨利和他们在一起，那该有多好啊！现在却好，她就是见到景色优美的地方，也欣赏不了。她心里这样想着．嘴里却没有说出来，虽然心里不满，但还是耐着性子戴上了帽子。</p> 
<p>不过，出乎她的意料，当她第一次从草坪上观看寺院时，不觉被它的壮观景象迷住了。整座大楼围成一个大四方院，四方院两侧耸立着缀满哥特装饰的楼房，令人为之赞赏。楼房的其余部分被参天的古树和葱郁的林木所遮掩，屋后有陡峭的苍山为屏障，即便在草木凋零的三月，山景也很秀丽。凯瑟琳没有见过这么瑰丽的景色，心里真是喜出望外，也不等待内行人的指点，便贸然赞叹起来＿将军带着同感激的心情听她说着，仿佛他自己对诺桑觉寺一直没有主见似的。</p> 
<p>下一步是去观赏菜园。将军领着她穿过庄园的一小截，来到了菜园那里。</p> 
<p>这块园子面积之大，使凯瑟琳听了不由得吓了一跳，因为把艾伦先生和她父亲的园子合在一起，加上教堂的坟地和果园，还及不上它一半大。围墙似乎多得不计其数，而且长得无边无际，墙内的暖房多得好像是一个村庄似的。似乎可以容下整个教区的人都在里面工作。将军见她露出惊讶的神气，不觉十分得意。其实她脸上的神气已经很明显了，可是将军还要硬逼着她说，她以前从未见过可以与它伦比的菜园。将军随即谦虚的承认，他自己可没有这种奢望，连想都不曾想过，不过他的确相信这园子在王国是无与伦比的。如果说他有什么癖好的话，那就在这上面。他喜欢果木园。他虽说在吃上一般不大讲究，但他喜欢上等的水果，或者说，如果他不喜欢，他的朋友和孩子还喜欢呢。不过，照料他这样的果园，那是很麻烦的事情。那些最珍贵的果子即使费尽心血，也不见得一准能保证收得到，去年菠萝种植房总共才结了一百个菠萝。他想艾伦先生一定像他一样，对这些事感到很头痛。</p> 
<p>“不，他才不呢。艾伦先生并不关心果园，他连进都不进去。”</p> 
<p>将军脸上浮出自呜得意的微笑，但愿他也能做到这一点，因为他每次进园子，总发现有这样那样的问题，达不到他的计划要求，使他为之烦恼。</p> 
<p>“艾伦先生的轮作暖房搞得怎么样？”将军一边往里走，一边说起了自己这个轮作暖房的情况。</p> 
<p>艾伦先生只有一个小暖房，到了冬天，艾伦太太用来存放自己的花草，里面不时地生着火。</p> 
<p>“他真有福气！”将军带着欣喜而鄙夷的神情说道。</p> 
<p>“他领着莫兰小姐一区一区地都去过了，走遍了每一个角落，直至莫兰小姐实在看腻了，惊叹得没劲了，他才允许两位小姐趁机走出一道外门。接着又表示想查看一下凉亭经过新近修缮以后效果如何，建议莫兰小姐若是不累的话，大家不妨多走一段，不会引起不快的。</p> 
<p>“可你往哪儿走，埃丽诺？你为什么挑选一条又阴又湿的小道？莫兰小姐会打湿衣服的。我们最好从庄园里穿过去。”</p> 
<p>“我最喜爱这条小径，”蒂尔尼小姐说，“我总觉得这条路最好，最近。不过，也快有点湿。”</p> 
<p>那是一条狭窄的小道，逶迤穿过一片茂密的苏格兰老杉林。凯瑟琳被小径的幽暗景致吸引住了，急切地想要钻进去，即使将军不肯赞成，她也止不住要向前走去。将军看出了她的心思，再次劝她注意身体，可是无济于事，便客客气气地不再阻拦了。不过，他本人要失陪了，因为他受不了那阻暗的光线，他要从另一条道上去迎她们。将军转身走了，凯瑟琳惊奇地发现，他这一走，她精神上反而感到大为释然。幸而这种释然来得真切，惊讶并未引起痛苦。她带着从容欣喜的口吻说起，这样的树林会给人一种愉快的忧郁感。</p> 
<p>“我特别喜爱这块地方，”她的伙伴叹了一口气说。“我母亲过去最喜欢在这里散步。”</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳先前从未听见这家人提起过蒂尔尼太太，蒂尔尼小姐的深情回忆激起了她的兴趣，使她骤然变了脸色，静悄悄地等着倾听更多的情况。</p> 
<p>“以前我常和她来这里散步，”埃丽诺接着说道，“虽然我当时并不像后来那样喜欢这个地方。那时候，我实在奇怪她怎么会看中这个地方。可是现在由于对她的怀念，我也就很喜欢这个地方了。”</p> 
<p>“难道他丈夫，”凯瑟琳心里在想，“不是也应该很喜欢这个地方吗？然而将军偏偏不愿走进去。”蒂尔尼小姐仍然一声不响，凯瑟琳贸然说道：“她的去世一定引起了巨大的悲痛。”</p> 
<p>“巨大的、与日俱增的悲痛。”，蒂尔尼小姐用低沉的声调答道“母亲去世时，我才十三岁，虽然对于一个孩子来说，我也许是够悲痛的了，但我当时井不知道、也不可能知道这是多么大的损失。”</p> 
<p>她顿了顿，然后以很坚决的口气补充道：“你知道，我没有姐妹。虽然亨利——一虽然我两个哥哥都很疼爱我，亨利还谢天谢地地经常回家，但我不可能不常常感到很孤独。”</p> 
<p>“毫无疑问，你一定很想念他。”</p> 
<p>“做母亲的就会始终呆在家里，像个朝夕相伴的朋友。母亲的影响比任何人的都大。”</p> 
<p>“她是个十分可爱的女人吧？她长得很漂亮吧？寺院里有她的画像吗？她为什么那样喜欢那片树林子？是因为精神沮丧的关系？”</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳迫不及待地提了这一连串问题。前三个问题当即得到了肯定的回答，另外两个给略过去了。凯瑟琳每提一个问题，无论得到回答与否，都要对已故的蒂尔尼太太增添一分兴趣。她相信她的婚事一定不美满。将军一准是个无情无义的丈夫。他连他妻子散步的地方都不喜欢，那他还会喜欢他的妻子吗？另外，他虽然仪表堂堂，但他脸上有一种异样的表情，说明他亏待过他妻子。</p> 
<p>“我想，你母亲的画像，”凯瑟琳觉得自己的问题十分圆滑，不禁涨红了脸，“挂在你父亲房里吧？”</p> 
<p>“不。原先打算挂在客厅里，可我父亲觉得画得不好，有一段时间没有地方挂。母亲死后不久，我把它要过来，挂在我的卧房里，我将很高兴地带你去看看，画得很像我母亲。”这又是一条证据。妻子的画像，而且画得很像，做丈夫的却不稀罕。他对妻子一定残酷至极。</p> 
<p>将军先前尽管殷勤备至，可还是引起了凯瑟琳的反感。凯瑟琳不想再向自己掩饰这种反感了。以前是惧怕和讨厌，现在变成了极度的憎恨。是的，憎恨！将军居然残酷地对待一个如此可爱的女人，真叫她感到可憎。她经常在书里看到这种人物，艾伦先生说这些人物很不自然，写过了头，可这里却是个确凿的反证。</p> 
<p>她刚刚想妥这个问题，不觉来到小径尽头，马上和将军碰上了头。她尽管义愤填膺，但是又不得不和他走在一起，听他说话，甚至也跟着他笑。然而，她再也不能从周围的景色中获得乐趣了，脚步顿时变得懒散起来。将军觉察了这一点，为了关心客人的健康，就催促凯瑟琳和他女儿赶快回屋，他这样关切似乎在责备凯瑟琳不该对他怀有那种看法。将军在一刻钟后也跟着回去。他们又分手了。但是半分钟后，他又把埃丽话叫回去，严厉地责成说：在他回来之前，决不准她带着朋友在寺院里乱转。他再一次迫不及待地拖延了凯瑟琳眼巴巴想干的事情，让她觉得实在奇怪。</p>
