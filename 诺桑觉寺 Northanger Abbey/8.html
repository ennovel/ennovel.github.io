The Thorpes and James Morland were there only two minutes before them; and Isabella having gone through the usual ceremonial of meeting her friend with the most smiling and affectionate haste, of admiring the set of her gown, and envying the curl of her hair, they followed their chaperones, arm in arm, into the ballroom, whispering to each other whenever a thought occurred, and supplying the place of many ideas by a squeeze of the hand or a smile of affection.</p> 
<p>The dancing began within a few minutes after they were seated; and James, who had been engaged quite as long as his sister, was very importunate with Isabella to stand up; but John was gone into the card-room to speak to a friend, and nothing, she declared, should induce her to join the set before her dear Catherine could join it too. "I assure you," said she, "I would not stand up without your dear sister for all the world; for if I did we should certainly be separated the whole evening." Catherine accepted this kindness with gratitude, and they continued as they were for three minutes longer, when Isabella, who had been talking to James on the other side of her, turned again to his sister and whispered, "My dear creature, I am afraid I must leave you, your brother is so amazingly impatient to begin; I know you will not mind my going away, and I dare say John will be back in a moment, and then you may easily find me out." Catherine, though a little disappointed, had too much good nature to make any opposition, and the others rising up, Isabella had only time to press her friend's hand and say, "Good-bye, my dear love," before they hurried off. The younger Miss Thorpes being also dancing, Catherine was left to the mercy of Mrs. Thorpe and Mrs. Allen, between whom she now remained. She could not help being vexed at the non-appearance of Mr. Thorpe, for she not only longed to be dancing, but was likewise aware that, as the real dignity of her situation could not be known, she was sharing with the scores of other young ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner. To be disgraced in the eye of the world, to wear the appearance of infamy while her heart is all purity, her actions all innocence, and the misconduct of another the true source of her debasement, is one of those circumstances which peculiarly belong to the heroine's life, and her fortitude under it what particularly dignifies her character. Catherine had fortitude too; she suffered, but no murmur passed her lips.</p> 
<p>From this state of humiliation, she was roused, at the end of ten minutes, to a pleasanter feeling, by seeing, not Mr. Thorpe, but Mr. Tilney, within three yards of the place where they sat; he seemed to be moving that way, but he did not see her, and therefore the smile and the blush, which his sudden reappearance raised in Catherine, passed away without sullying her heroic importance. He looked as handsome and as lively as ever, and was talking with interest to a fashionable and pleasing-looking young woman, who leant on his arm, and whom Catherine immediately guessed to be his sister; thus unthinkingly throwing away a fair opportunity of considering him lost to her forever, by being married already. But guided only by what was simple and probable, it had never entered her head that Mr. Tilney could be married; he had not behaved, he had not talked, like the married men to whom she had been used; he had never mentioned a wife, and he had acknowledged a sister. From these circumstances sprang the instant conclusion of his sister's now being by his side; and therefore, instead of turning of a deathlike paleness and falling in a fit on Mrs. Allen's bosom, Catherine sat erect, in the perfect use of her senses, and with cheeks only a little redder than usual.</p> 
<p>Mr. Tilney and his companion, who continued, though slowly, to approach, were immediately preceded by a lady, an acquaintance of Mrs. Thorpe; and this lady stopping to speak to her, they, as belonging to her, stopped likewise, and Catherine, catching Mr. Tilney's eye, instantly received from him the smiling tribute of recognition. She returned it with pleasure, and then advancing still nearer, he spoke both to her and Mrs. Allen, by whom he was very civilly acknowledged. "I am very happy to see you again, sir, indeed; I was afraid you had left Bath." He thanked her for her fears, and said that he had quitted it for a week, on the very morning after his having had the pleasure of seeing her.</p> 
<p>"Well, sir, and I dare say you are not sorry to be back again, for it is just the place for young people -- and indeed for everybody else too. I tell Mr. Allen, when he talks of being sick of it, that I am sure he should not complain, for it is so very agreeable a place, that it is much better to be here than at home at this dull time of year. I tell him he is quite in luck to be sent here for his health."</p> 
<p>"And I hope, madam, that Mr. Allen will be obliged to like the place, from finding it of service to him."</p> 
<p>"Thank you, sir. I have no doubt that he will. A neighbour of ours, Dr. Skinner, was here for his health last winter, and came away quite stout."</p> 
<p>"That circumstance must give great encouragement."</p> 
<p>"Yes, sir -- and Dr. Skinner and his family were here three months; so I tell Mr. Allen he must not be in a hurry to get away."</p> 
<p>Here they were interrupted by a request from Mrs. Thorpe to Mrs. Allen, that she would move a little to accommodate Mrs. Hughes and Miss Tilney with seats, as they had agreed to join their party. This was accordingly done, Mr. Tilney still continuing standing before them; and after a few minutes' consideration, he asked Catherine to dance with him. This compliment, delightful as it was, produced severe mortification to the lady; and in giving her denial, she expressed her sorrow on the occasion so very much as if she really felt it that had Thorpe, who joined her just afterwards, been half a minute earlier, he might have thought her sufferings rather too acute. The very easy manner in which he then told her that he had kept her waiting did not by any means reconcile her more to her lot; nor did the particulars which he entered into while they were standing up, of the horses and dogs of the friend whom he had just left, and of a proposed exchange of terriers between them, interest her so much as to prevent her looking very often towards that part of the room where she had left Mr. Tilney. Of her dear Isabella, to whom she particularly longed to point out that gentleman, she could see nothing. They were in different sets. She was separated from all her party, and away from all her acquaintance; one mortification succeeded another, and from the whole she deduced this useful lesson, that to go previously engaged to a ball does not necessarily increase either the dignity or enjoyment of a young lady. From such a moralizing strain as this, she was suddenly roused by a touch on the shoulder, and turning round, perceived Mrs. Hughes directly behind her, attended by Miss Tilney and a gentleman. "I beg your pardon, Miss Morland," said she, "for this liberty -- but I cannot anyhow get to Miss Thorpe, and Mrs. Thorpe said she was sure you would not have the least objection to letting in this young lady by you." Mrs. Hughes could not have applied to any creature in the room more happy to oblige her than Catherine. The young ladies were introduced to each other, Miss Tilney expressing a proper sense of such goodness, Miss Morland with the real delicacy of a generous mind making light of the obligation; and Mrs. Hughes, satisfied with having so respectably settled her young charge, returned to her party.</p> 
<p>Miss Tilney had a good figure, a pretty face, and a very agreeable countenance; and her air, though it had not all the decided pretension, the resolute stylishness of Miss Thorpe's, had more real elegance. Her manners showed good sense and good breeding; they were neither shy nor affectedly open; and she seemed capable of being young, attractive, and at a ball without wanting to fix the attention of every man near her, and without exaggerated feelings of ecstatic delight or inconceivable vexation on every little trifling occurrence. Catherine, interested at once by her appearance and her relationship to Mr. Tilney, was desirous of being acquainted with her, and readily talked therefore whenever she could think of anything to say, and had courage and leisure for saying it. But the hindrance thrown in the way of a very speedy intimacy, by the frequent want of one or more of these requisites, prevented their doing more than going through the first rudiments of an acquaintance, by informing themselves how well the other liked Bath, how much she admired its buildings and surrounding country, whether she drew, or played, or sang, and whether she was fond of riding on horseback.</p> 
<p>The two dances were scarcely concluded before Catherine found her arm gently seized by her faithful Isabella, who in great spirits exclaimed, "At last I have got you. My dearest creature, I have been looking for you this hour. What could induce you to come into this set, when you knew I was in the other? I have been quite wretched without you."</p> 
<p>"My dear Isabella, how was it possible for me to get at you? I could not even see where you were."</p> 
<p>"So I told your brother all the time -- but he would not believe me. Do go and see for her, Mr. Morland, said I -- but all in vain -- he would not stir an inch. Was not it so, Mr. Morland? But you men are all so immoderately lazy! I have been scolding him to such a degree, my dear Catherine, you would be quite amazed. You know I never stand upon ceremony with such people."</p> 
<p>"Look at that young lady with the white beads round her head," whispered Catherine, detaching her friend from James. "It is Mr. Tilney's sister."</p> 
<p>"Oh! Heavens! You don't say so! Let me look at her this moment. What a delightful girl! I never saw anything half so beautiful! But where is her all-conquering brother? Is he in the room? Point him out to me this instant, if he is. I die to see him. Mr. Morland, you are not to listen. We are not talking about you."</p> 
<p>"But what is all this whispering about? What is going on?"</p> 
<p>"There now, I knew how it would be. You men have such restless curiosity! Talk of the curiosity of women, indeed! 'Tis nothing. But be satisfied, for you are not to know anything at all of the matter."</p> 
<p>"And is that likely to satisfy me, do you think?"</p> 
<p>"Well, I declare I never knew anything like you. What can it signify to you, what we are talking of. Perhaps we are talking about you; therefore I would advise you not to listen, or you may happen to hear something not very agreeable."</p> 
<p>In this commonplace chatter, which lasted some time, the original subject seemed entirely forgotten; and though Catherine was very well pleased to have it dropped for a while, she could not avoid a little suspicion at the total suspension of all Isabella's impatient desire to see Mr. Tilney. When the orchestra struck up a fresh dance, James would have led his fair partner away, but she resisted. "I tell you, Mr. Morland," she cried, "I would not do such a thing for all the world. How can you be so teasing; only conceive, my dear Catherine, what your brother wants me to do. He wants me to dance with him again, though I tell him that it is a most improper thing, and entirely against the rules. It would make us the talk of the place, if we were not to change partners."</p> 
<p>"Upon my honour," said James, "in these public assemblies, it is as often done as not."</p> 
<p>"Nonsense, how can you say so? But when you men have a point to carry, you never stick at anything. My sweet Catherine, do support me; persuade your brother how impossible it is. Tell him that it would quite shock you to see me do such a thing; now would not it?"</p> 
<p>"No, not at all; but if you think it wrong, you had much better change."</p> 
<p>"There," cried Isabella, "you hear what your sister says, and yet you will not mind her. Well, remember that it is not my fault, if we set all the old ladies in Bath in a bustle. Come along, my dearest Catherine, for heaven's sake, and stand by me." And off they went, to regain their former place. John Thorpe, in the meanwhile, had walked away; and Catherine, ever willing to give Mr. Tilney an opportunity of repeating the agreeable request which had already flattered her once, made her way to Mrs. Allen and Mrs. Thorpe as fast as she could, in the hope of finding him still with them -- a hope which, when it proved to be fruitless, she felt to have been highly unreasonable. "Well, my dear," said Mrs. Thorpe, impatient for praise of her son, "I hope you have had an agreeable partner."</p> 
<p>"Very agreeable, madam."</p> 
<p>"I am glad of it. John has charming spirits, has not he?"</p> 
<p>"Did you meet Mr. Tilney, my dear?" said Mrs. Allen.</p> 
<p>"No, where is he?"</p> 
<p>"He was with us just now, and said he was so tired of lounging about, that he was resolved to go and dance; so I thought perhaps he would ask you, if he met with you."</p> 
<p>"Where can he be?" said Catherine, looking round; but she had not looked round long before she saw him leading a young lady to the dance.</p> 
<p>"Ah! He has got a partner; I wish he had asked you," said Mrs. Allen; and after a short silence, she added, "he is a very agreeable young man."</p> 
<p>"Indeed he is, Mrs. Allen," said Mrs. Thorpe, smiling complacently; "I must say it, though I am his mother, that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world."</p> 
<p>This inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension of many; but it did not puzzle Mrs. Allen, for after only a moment's consideration, she said, in a whisper to Catherine, "I dare say she thought I was speaking of her son."</p> 
<p>Catherine was disappointed and vexed. She seemed to have missed by so little the very object she had had in view; and this persuasion did not incline her to a very gracious reply, when John Thorpe came up to her soon afterwards and said, "Well, Miss Morland, I suppose you and I are to stand up and jig it together again."</p> 
<p>"Oh, no; I am much obliged to you, our two dances are over; and, besides, I am tired, and do not mean to dance any more."</p> 
<p>"Do not you? Then let us walk about and quiz people. Come along with me, and I will show you the four greatest quizzers in the room; my two younger sisters and their partners. I have been laughing at them this half hour."</p> 
<p>Again Catherine excused herself; and at last he walked off to quiz his sisters by himself. The rest of the evening she found very dull; Mr. Tilney was drawn away from their party at tea, to attend that of his partner; Miss Tilney, though belonging to it, did not sit near her, and James and Isabella were so much engaged in conversing together that the latter had no leisure to bestow more on her friend than one smile, one squeeze, and one "dearest Catherine."</p> 
<p>尽管凯瑟琳要看《尤多尔弗》，艾伦太太担心裁缝来迟，普尔蒂尼街这边的人还是按时赶到了舞厅。索普一家和詹姆斯只不过比他们早到两分钟。伊莎贝拉像往常一样，一见到她的朋友便急忙上前欢迎，只见她喜笑颜开，亲热无比。时而赞赏她长裙的款式，时而羡慕她鬈发的样式。接着，两人跟着年长的陪伴人，臂挽臂地步人舞厅，脑子里一有个什么念头，便要嘀咕一番，有许多念头是用捏捏手和亲切的微笑代为表达的。</p> 
<p>大伙刚坐下不几分钟，跳舞便开始了。詹姆斯同她妹妹一样，早就约好了舞伴，因而再三催促伊莎贝拉快点起身。哪知约翰跑进牌室找朋友说话了，伊莎贝拉当众宣布：要是亲爱的凯瑟琳不能一道加入，她说什么也不先跳。"我告诉你吧，”她说，“你亲爱的妹妹不跟着一起来，我就决不跳舞。不然，我们整个晚上都要分开了。”凯瑟琳很感激地领了她的情，就这样又坐了三分钟。</p> 
<p>却说伊莎贝拉先是跟坐在她另一边的詹姆斯说着话，这时突然又转向凯瑟琳，悄声说道：“亲爱的，我恐怕得离开你了，你哥哥实在等不及了。我知道你不会介意让我去的。约翰一会儿准回来。那时，你很容易就能找到我。”</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳虽然点点失望，但她脾气好，没有加以阻拦。于是那两个人立起身，伊莎贝拉只来得及捏了捏她朋友的手，说了声“ 回头见，我的宝贝！”便同詹姆斯匆匆走开了。索普家的二小姐三小姐也在跳舞，凯瑟琳依旧坐在索晋太太和艾伦太太中间，跟她们作伴。索普先生还没露面，这不能不使她感到恼火。她不单渴望跳舞，而且也知道：别人既然不知道她实际上已经堂堂有了舞伴，那她就像坐在那里找不到舞伴的几十位姑娘一样丢脸。一个心地纯洁、行为无辜的姑娘，当着大家丢人现眼，有失体面，殊不知这完全是由于别人的差失造成的，这种情况想必也是女主角生活中的特有遭遇吧。在这种遭遇中，女主角表现得越刚强，人格就显得越高尚。凯瑟琳也是刚强的。她心里感到屈辱，但嘴里并不抱怨。</p> 
<p>忍气吞声地等了十分钟，凯瑟琳心里蓦地一惊，不觉顿时转忧为喜。原来，她在离她座位不到三码远的地方看见了他，不是索普先生，而是蒂尔尼先生。似乎在朝她们这边走来，但是没有望见她。因此，凯瑟琳因为看见他突现而泛起的微笑和红晕便又消失了，并没玷污她这个女主角的尊严。蒂尔尼先生看上去像以往一样英俊，一样活跃，正在兴致勃勃地跟一位时髦俏丽的年轻女子谈话。那女子搭着他的手臂，凯瑟琳马上猜测那是他妹妹。她本来大可认为他已经结婚，因而使她永远失去了他。现在却不假思索地抛弃了这一良好机会。不过。单从简单、可能的情况来判断，她也从未想过蒂尔尼先生可能会结婚。他的言谈举止与她熟悉的已婚男子并不相像。他从未提起他有妻子，只说过有个妹妹。根据这些情况，她立刻断定，现在在他身边的是妹妹。因此，凯瑟琳没有变得面无人色，也没有昏倒在艾伦太太怀里，只见她笔挺挺地坐着，头脑十分清醒，双颊只比平时略红一点。</p> 
<p>蒂尔尼先生与他的女伴跟在一位妇人后边，缓慢而不停地向她们走来。这位妇人认识索普太太，因而便停下同她说话，蒂尔尼兄妹因为由她领着，也跟着停住脚。蒂尔尼先生一望见凯瑟琳正在看他，便立即露出微笑，表示相识。凯瑟琳也快活地向他笑了笑。接着，蒂尔尼先生又往前走了几步。同凯瑟琳和艾伦太太说话，艾伦太太客客气气地向他打了个招呼：“我很高兴又见到你，先生。我本来担心你离巴思了呢。”，蒂尔尼先生谢谢她的关心，说他离开过巴思一个星期，就是他有幸认识她的第二无早晨走的。</p> 
<p>“唔，先生，你这次回来肯定不会后悔吧，因为这里正是年轻人的天地．当然也是其他人的天地。当艾伦先生谈到他讨厌巴思时，我就对他说，他的确不该抱怨，因为这个地方实在太可爱了，逢上这样的淡季，待在这里比待在家里强多了。我跟他说，他真有福气，能到这里疗养。”</p> 
<p>“我希望，太太，艾伦先生发现巴思对他大有裨益，到时候就该喜欢这个地方了。”</p> 
<p>“谢谢你，先生。我相信他会的。我们的一位邻居斯金纳博士去年冬天来这里疗养过，回去的时候身体好极了。”</p> 
<p>“这个事实一定会带来很大的鼓舞。”</p> 
<p>“是的，先生。斯金纳博士一家在这里住了三个月呢。因此我跟艾伦先生说，他不要急着走。”</p> 
<p>话说到这儿让索普太太打断了。她请艾伦太太稍许挪动一下，给休斯太太和蒂尔尼小姐让个座，因为她俩答应陪她们一起坐坐。大家坐下以后，蒂尔尼先生还依然立在她们面前。他思谋了几分钟之后，便请凯瑟琳与他跳舞。这本是件值得高兴的事，不想女方却感到悔恨交加。她表示谢绝时，显得微不胜遗憾，好像煞有其事似的，幸亏索普刚来，他若是早来半分钟，准会以为她万分痛苦。接着，索普又大大咧咧地对她说让她久等了，但这丝毫没有使她觉得好过些。他们起身跳舞时，索普细说起他刚刚辞别的那位朋友的马和狗，还说他们打算交换獮，可是凯瑟琳对此不感兴趣，她仍旧不时地朝她离开蒂尔尼先生的地方张望。她特别想让亲爱的伊莎贝拉见见他，可惜伊莎贝拉连个影子也见不着。他们不在一个舞群里。她离开了自己的所有伙伴，离开了自己的所工有熟人，不痛快的事真是一桩接着一桩。她从这—桩桩事里，得出了一条有益的教训，舞会前先约好舞伴，不见得会增加一位少女的尊严与乐趣。正当她如此这般吸取教训时，忽然觉得有人拍了拍她的肩膀，将她从沉思中惊醒。她一扭头，发现休斯太太就在她身后，由蒂尔尼小姐和一位先生伴随着。“请原谅我冒昧，莫兰小姐。”休斯太太说。“我无论如何也找不到索普小姐。索普太太说，你肯定不会介意陪陪这位小姐。”休斯太太还真找对了人，这屋里谁也不会比凯瑟琳更乐意做这份人情了。休斯太太为两位小姐作了介绍。蒂尔尼小姐很有礼貌地感谢了对方的好意。莫兰小姐本着慷慨的精神，委婉地表示这算不了什么。休斯太太把她带来的小姐作了妥善安置之后，便满意地回到她的同伙那里。</p> 
<p>蒂尔尼小姐身材苗条，脸蛋俊俏，和颜悦色的十分招人爱。她的仪态虽然不像索普小姐的那样十分做作，十分时髦，但却更加端庄大方。她的言谈举止表现出卓越的见识和良好的教养。她既不羞怯，也不故作大方。她年轻迷人，但是到了舞会上，并不想吸引周围每个男人的注意。不管遇到什么芥末小事，也不会装腔作势地欣喜若狂，或是莫名其妙地焦灼万分。由于她的美貌和她与蒂尔尼先生的关系。凯瑟琳立刻对她产生了兴趣，自然很想同她结识。因此，每当想起什么话头，很乐意与她谈，而且也有勇气、有闲暇与她谈。但是，由于这些先决条件经常出现缺这少那的情况，两人也就无法立即成为知己。只能进行一些相识间的初步交谈，说说各自喜欢不喜欢巴思，是否欣赏巴思的建筑和周围的乡村，绘不绘画，弹不弹琴，唱不唱歌，爱不爱骑马。</p> 
<p>两支舞曲刚刚结束，凯瑟琳发觉忠实的伊莎贝拉轻轻抓住了她的手臂，只听她兴高采烈地嚷道；“我终于找到你了。我心爱的，我找了你一个钟头了。你知道我在另一个舞群里跳舞，怎么能跑到这一个舞群来呢？我离开了你真没劲儿。”</p> 
<p>“亲爱的伊莎贝拉、我怎么能找到你呢？我连你在哪儿都看不见。”</p> 
<p>“我一直这样告诉你哥哥，可他就是不肯相信。‘快去找找你妹妹，莫兰先生，’我说。可全是白搭，他一动不动。难道不是吗，莫兰先生？你们男人都懒得出奇！我一直在狠狠地责备他，亲爱的觊瑟琳，你会感到大为惊奇的。你知道我对这种人从不客气。”</p> 
<p>“你看那个头上戴白珠子的小姐，”凯瑟琳轻声说道，一面把她的朋友从詹姆斯身边拉开。“那是蒂尔尼先生的妹妹。”</p> 
<p>“哦，天哪！真的吗？快让我瞧瞧。多可爱的姑娘啊！我从没见过这么美的人儿！她那位人人喜爱的哥哥在哪儿？在不在大厅里？如果在，请马上指给我看。我真想看看他。莫兰先生，你不用听，我们没说你。”</p> 
<p>“那你们在嘀咕什么？出什么事了？”</p> 
<p>“你看，我就知道是这么回事！你们男人好奇起来简直坐立不安！还说女人好奇，哼！和你们比起来真是小巫见大巫。不过，你就死心了吧，你休想知道是什么事。”</p> 
<p>“你以为这样我就死心啦？”</p> 
<p>“哎．真奇怪，我从没见过你这号人。我们谈什么与你有什么相干？也许我们就在谈论你，因此我奉劝你不要听，不然、你说不定会听见不太顺耳的话。”</p> 
<p>这样无聊地闲扯了好一阵，原先的话题似乎给忘了个精光。凯瑟琳虽说很愿意让它中断一会，但是她禁不住有点怀疑：伊莎贝拉原先急切地想见蒂尔尼先生，怎么又一下子就忘个精光。当乐队重新奏起新舞曲时，詹姆斯又想把他的漂亮舞伴拉走，但是被拒绝。“你听我说，莫兰先生，”</p> 
<p>伊莎贝拉喊道，“我决不会干这种事儿。你怎么能这么烦人！你看看，亲爱的凯瑟琳，你哥哥想让我干什么？他想让我同他跳舞，虽然我跟他说这极不恰当，太不成体统。我们要是不换换舞伴，岂不成了人家的话柄。”</p> 
<p>“说真话，”詹姆斯说，“在公共舞会上，这是常有的事。”</p> 
<p>“胡扯，你怎么能这么说？你们男人要达到个什么目的，总是无所顾忌。亲爱的凯瑟琳，快帮帮我的忙，劝劝你哥哥，让他知道这是办不到的。告诉他，你要是见我干这种事，定会大为震惊。难道不是吗？”</p> 
<p>“不，决不会。不过，你要是认为不恰当，那你最好换换舞伴。”</p> 
<p>“你看，”伊莎贝拉嚷道，“你妹妹的话你都听见了，可你就是不理会。你记住，我们要是惹得巴思的老太太们飞短流长的，那可不是我的过错。来吧，亲爱的凯瑟琳。看在老天爷的份上，跟我站在一起。”两人拔腿就走，回到原来的位置。这当儿，约翰·索普早溜掉了。凯瑟琳刚才受过蒂尔尼先生的一次抬举，很想给他个机会重提一下那个令人愉快的请求，便快步向艾伦太太和索普太太那儿走去，实指望见他还和她们在一起。她的希望落空以后，又觉得抱这样的希望也太可笑了。“唔，亲爱的，”索普太太说，迫不及待地想听听别人夸夸她的儿子。我希望你找了个愉快的舞伴。”</p> 
<p>“愉快极了，太太。”</p> 
<p>“我很高兴。约翰神采迷人，是吧？”</p> 
<p>“你遇见蒂尔尼先生没有，好孩子？"艾伦太太说道。</p> 
<p>“没有。他在哪儿？”</p> 
<p>“他刚才还跟我们在一起，说他逛荡腻了，打定主意要去跳舞。所以我想，他要是碰见你，兴许会请你跳的。”</p> 
<p>“他可能在哪儿呢？”凯瑟琳边说边四下张望。没张望多久，便发现蒂尔尼先生正领着一位年轻小姐去跳舞。</p> 
<p>“哦！他有舞伴了！可惜他没请你跳，”艾伦太太说道。沉默了一会之后，她又补充道：他是个很讨人爱的小伙子。”</p> 
<p>“的确是，艾伦太太，”索普太太自鸣得意地笑道。虽然我是他母亲，但我还是要说说，天下没有比他更讨人爱的小伙子了。”</p> 
<p>这句牛头不对马嘴的回答让许多人听了，也许会感到莫名其妙。但是艾伦太太却不感到困惑，只见她略思片刻，便悄声对凯瑟琳说道：“她一准以为我在说她儿子。”</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳又失望，又气恼。她似乎只晚了＿步，就把眼见到手的机会放跑了。尔后不久，约翰·索普来到她跟前，说道：“莫兰小姐，我想我们还是再来跳一会儿吧。”凯瑟琳因为心里正在懊悔，也没给他个好声好气的回答。</p> 
<p>“噢，不。多谢你的好意，我们的两段舞已经跳过了。再说，我累了，不想再跳了。”</p> 
<p>“不想跳了？那就让我们在屋里走走，跟人开开玩笑。快跟我来吧，我要让你瞧瞧这屋里四个最滑稽的人：我的两位妹妹和她们的舞伴。我这半个钟头里，一直在嘲笑他们。”</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳再次谢绝了。最后，索普先生只好独自去嘲弄他的妹妹。凯瑟琳觉得后半个晚上非常无聊。用茶时，蒂尔尼先生让人从她们中间拽走了，去应酬他的舞伴的那伙人。蒂尔尼小姐虽然与她们在一块，但是并不挨近她。詹姆斯与伊莎贝拉光顾得一起说话，伊莎贝拉无暇顾及她的朋友，顶多对她笑一笑，捏一下手，叫一声“最亲爱的凯瑟琳”。</p>
