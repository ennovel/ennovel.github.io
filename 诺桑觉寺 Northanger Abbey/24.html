It was Sunday, and the whole time between morning and afternoon service was required by the general in exercise abroad or eating cold meat at home; and great as was Catherine's curiosity, her courage was not equal to a wish of exploring them after dinner, either by the fading light of the sky between six and seven o'clock, or by the yet more partial though stronger illumination of a treacherous lamp. The day was unmarked therefore by anything to interest her imagination beyond the sight of a very elegant monument to the memory of Mrs. Tilney, which immediately fronted the family pew. By that her eye was instantly caught and long retained; and the perusal of the highly strained epitaph, in which every virtue was ascribed to her by the inconsolable husband, who must have been in some way or other her destroyer, affected her even to tears.</p> 
<p>That the general, having erected such a monument, should be able to face it, was not perhaps very strange, and yet that he could sit so boldly collected within its view, maintain so elevated an air, look so fearlessly around, nay, that he should even enter the church, seemed wonderful to Catherine. Not, however, that many instances of beings equally hardened in guilt might not be produced. She could remember dozens who had persevered in every possible vice, going on from crime to crime, murdering whomsoever they chose, without any feeling of humanity or remorse; till a violent death or a religious retirement closed their black career. The erection of the monument itself could not in the smallest degree affect her doubts of Mrs. Tilney's actual decease. Were she even to descend into the family vault where her ashes were supposed to slumber, were she to behold the coffin in which they were said to be enclosed -- what could it avail in such a case? Catherine had read too much not to be perfectly aware of the ease with which a waxen figure might be introduced, and a supposititious funeral carried on.</p> 
<p>The succeeding morning promised something better. The general's early walk, ill-timed as it was in every other view, was favourable here; and when she knew him to be out of the house, she directly proposed to Miss Tilney the accomplishment of her promise. Eleanor was ready to oblige her; and Catherine reminding her as they went of another promise, their first visit in consequence was to the portrait in her bed-chamber. It represented a very lovely woman, with a mild and pensive countenance, justifying, so far, the expectations of its new observer; but they were not in every respect answered, for Catherine had depended upon meeting with features, hair, complexion, that should be the very counterpart, the very image, if not of Henry's, of Eleanor's -- the only portraits of which she had been in the habit of thinking, bearing always an equal resemblance of mother and child. A face once taken was taken for generations. But here she was obliged to look and consider and study for a likeness. She contemplated it, however, in spite of this drawback, with much emotion, and, but for a yet stronger interest, would have left it unwillingly.</p> 
<p>Her agitation as they entered the great gallery was too much for any endeavour at discourse; she could only look at her companion. Eleanor's countenance was dejected, yet sedate; and its composure spoke her inured to all the gloomy objects to which they were advancing. Again she passed through the folding doors, again her hand was upon the important lock, and Catherine, hardly able to breathe, was turning to close the former with fearful caution, when the figure, the dreaded figure of the general himself at the further end of the gallery, stood before her! The name of "Eleanor" at the same moment, in his loudest tone, resounded through the building, giving to his daughter the first intimation of his presence, and to Catherine terror upon terror. An attempt at concealment had been her first instinctive movement on perceiving him, yet she could scarcely hope to have escaped his eye; and when her friend, who with an apologizing look darted hastily by her, had joined and disappeared with him, she ran for safety to her own room, and, locking herself in, believed that she should never have courage to go down again. She remained there at least an hour, in the greatest agitation, deeply commiserating the state of her poor friend, and expecting a summons herself from the angry general to attend him in his own apartment. No summons, however, arrived; and at last, on seeing a carriage drive up to the abbey, she was emboldened to descend and meet him under the protection of visitors. The breakfast-room was gay with company; and she was named to them by the general as the friend of his daughter, in a complimentary style, which so well concealed his resentful ire, as to make her feel secure at least of life for the present. And Eleanor, with a command of countenance which did honour to her concern for his character, taking an early occasion of saying to her, "My father only wanted me to answer a note," she began to hope that she had either been unseen by the general, or that from some consideration of policy she should be allowed to suppose herself so. Upon this trust she dared still to remain in his presence, after the company left them, and nothing occurred to disturb it.</p> 
<p>In the course of this morning's reflections, she came to a resolution of making her next attempt on the forbidden door alone. It would be much better in every respect that Eleanor should know nothing of the matter. To involve her in the danger of a second detection, to court her into an apartment which must wring her heart, could not be the office of a friend. The general's utmost anger could not be to herself what it might be to a daughter; and, besides, she thought the examination itself would be more satisfactory if made without any companion. It would be impossible to explain to Eleanor the suspicions, from which the other had, in all likelihood, been hitherto happily exempt; nor could she therefore, in her presence, search for those proofs of the general's cruelty, which however they might yet have escaped discovery, she felt confident of somewhere drawing forth, in the shape of some fragmented journal, continued to the last gasp. Of the way to the apartment she was now perfectly mistress; and as she wished to get it over before Henry's return, who was expected on the morrow, there was no time to be lost. The day was bright, her courage high; at four o'clock, the sun was now two hours above the horizon, and it would be only her retiring to dress half an hour earlier than usual.</p> 
<p>It was done; and Catherine found herself alone in the gallery before the clocks had ceased to strike. It was no time for thought; she hurried on, slipped with the least possible noise through the folding doors, and without stopping to look or breathe, rushed forward to the one in question. The lock yielded to her hand, and, luckily, with no sullen sound that could alarm a human being. On tiptoe she entered; the room was before her; but it was some minutes before she could advance another step. She beheld what fixed her to the spot and agitated every feature. She saw a large, well-proportioned apartment, an handsome dimity bed, arranged as unoccupied with an housemaid's care, a bright Bath stove, mahogany wardrobes, and neatly painted chairs, on which the warm beams of a western sun gaily poured through two sash windows! Catherine had expected to have her feelings worked, and worked they were. Astonishment and doubt first seized them; and a shortly succeeding ray of common sense added some bitter emotions of shame. She could not be mistaken as to the room; but how grossly mistaken in everything else! -- in Miss Tilney's meaning, in her own calculation! This apartment, to which she had given a date so ancient, a position so awful, proved to be one end of what the general's father had built. There were two other doors in the chamber, leading probably into dressing-closets; but she had no inclination to open either. Would the veil in which Mrs. Tilney had last walked, or the volume in which she had last read, remain to tell what nothing else was allowed to whisper? No: whatever might have been the general's crimes, he had certainly too much wit to let them sue for detection. She was sick of exploring, and desired but to be safe in her own room, with her own heart only privy to its folly; and she was on the point of retreating as softly as she had entered, when the sound of footsteps, she could hardly tell where, made her pause and tremble. To be found there, even by a servant, would be unpleasant; but by the general (and he seemed always at hand when least wanted), much worse! She listened -- the sound had ceased; and resolving not to lose a moment, she passed through and closed the door. At that instant a door underneath was hastily opened; someone seemed with swift steps to ascend the stairs, by the head of which she had yet to pass before she could gain the gallery. She had no power to move. With a feeling of terror not very definable, she fixed her eyes on the staircase, and in a few moments it gave Henry to her view. "Mr. Tilney!" she exclaimed in a voice of more than common astonishment. He looked astonished too. "Good God!" she continued, not attending to his address. "How came you here? How came you up that staircase?"</p> 
<p>"How came I up that staircase!" he replied, greatly surprised. "Because it is my nearest way from the stable-yard to my own chamber; and why should I not come up it?"</p> 
<p>Catherine recollected herself, blushed deeply, and could say no more. He seemed to be looking in her countenance for that explanation which her lips did not afford. She moved on towards the gallery. "And may I not, in my turn," said he, as he pushed back the folding doors, "ask how you came here? This passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast-parlour to your apartment, as that staircase can be from the stables to mine."</p> 
<p>"I have been," said Catherine, looking down, "to see your mother's room."</p> 
<p>"My mother's room! Is there anything extraordinary to be seen there?"</p> 
<p>"No, nothing at all. I thought you did not mean to come back till tomorrow."</p> 
<p>"I did not expect to be able to return sooner, when I went away; but three hours ago I had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me. You look pale. I am afraid I alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs. Perhaps you did not know -- you were not aware of their leading from the offices in common use?"</p> 
<p>"No, I was not. You have had a very fine day for your ride."</p> 
<p>"Very; and does Eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in the house by yourself?"</p> 
<p>"Oh! No; she showed me over the greatest part on Saturday -- and we were coming here to these rooms -- but only" -- dropping her voice -- "your father was with us."</p> 
<p>"And that prevented you," said Henry, earnestly regarding her. "Have you looked into all the rooms in that passage?"</p> 
<p>"No, I only wanted to see -- Is not it very late? I must go and dress."</p> 
<p>"It is only a quarter past four" showing his watch -- "and you are not now in Bath. No theatre, no rooms to prepare for. Half an hour at Northanger must be enough."</p> 
<p>She could not contradict it, and therefore suffered herself to be detained, though her dread of further questions made her, for the first time in their acquaintance, wish to leave him. They walked slowly up the gallery. "Have you had any letter from Bath since I saw you?"</p> 
<p>"No, and I am very much surprised. Isabella promised so faithfully to write directly."</p> 
<p>"Promised so faithfully! A faithful promise! That puzzles me. I have heard of a faithful performance. But a faithful promise -- the fidelity of promising! It is a power little worth knowing, however, since it can deceive and pain you. My mother's room is very commodious, is it not? Large and cheerful-looking, and the dressing-closets so well disposed! It always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house, and I rather wonder that Eleanor should not take it for her own. She sent you to look at it, I suppose?"</p> 
<p>"No."</p> 
<p>"It has been your own doing entirely?" Catherine said nothing. After a short silence, during which he had closely observed her, he added, "As there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity, this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother's character, as described by Eleanor, which does honour to her memory. The world, I believe, never saw a better woman. But it is not often that virtue can boast an interest such as this. The domestic, unpretending merits of a person never known do not often create that kind of fervent, venerating tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours. Eleanor, I suppose, has talked of her a great deal?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, a great deal. That is -- no, not much, but what she did say was very interesting. Her dying so suddenly" (slowly, and with hesitation it was spoken), "and you -- none of you being at home -- and your father, I thought -- perhaps had not been very fond of her."</p> 
<p>"And from these circumstances," he replied (his quick eye fixed on hers), "you infer perhaps the probability of some negligence -- some" -- (involuntarily she shook her head) -- "or it may be -- of something still less pardonable." She raised her eyes towards him more fully than she had ever done before. "My mother's illness," he continued, "the seizure which ended in her death, was sudden. The malady itself, one from which she had often suffered, a bilious fever -- its cause therefore constitutional. On the third day, in short, as soon as she could be prevailed on, a physician attended her, a very respectable man, and one in whom she had always placed great confidence. Upon his opinion of her danger, two others were called in the next day, and remained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours. On the fifth day she died. During the progress of her disorder, Frederick and I (we were both at home) saw her repeatedly; and from our own observation can bear witness to her having received every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those about her, or which her situation in life could command. Poor Eleanor was absent, and at such a distance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin."</p> 
<p>"But your father," said Catherine, "was he afflicted?"</p> 
<p>"For a time, greatly so. You have erred in supposing him not attached to her. He loved her, I am persuaded, as well as it was possible for him to -- we have not all, you know, the same tenderness of disposition -- and I will not pretend to say that while she lived, she might not often have had much to bear, but though his temper injured her, his judgment never did. His value of her was sincere; and, if not permanently, he was truly afflicted by her death."</p> 
<p>"I am very glad of it," said Catherine; "it would have been very shocking!"</p> 
<p>"If I understand you rightly, you had formed a surmise of such horror as I have hardly words to -- Dear Miss Morland, consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained. What have you been judging from? Remember the country and the age in which we live. Remember that we are English, that we are Christians. Consult your own understanding, your own sense of the probable, your own observation of what is passing around you. Does our education prepare us for such atrocities? Do our laws connive at them? Could they be perpetrated without being known, in a country like this, where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing, where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies, and where roads and newspapers lay everything open? Dearest Miss Morland, what ideas have you been admitting?"</p> 
<p>They had reached the end of the gallery, and with tears of shame she ran off to her own room.</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳想要看看那几间神秘的屋子，可是第二天并没有得到机会。这天是星期日，早祷和晚祷之间的时间都让将军占去了，先是出去散步，后来又在家吃冷肉。凯瑟琳尽管好厅心切，但是让她在晚饭后六七点钟之间，借着天空中渐渐隐弱的光线去看那些房间，她还还没有那么大的胆量，灯光虽然比较明亮，但是照到的地方有限，而且也不大可靠，因此也不敢借着灯光去看。于是，这天就没出现让她感兴趣的事情，只在教堂的家族前面，看到一块十分精致的蒂尔尼夫人的纪念碑。她一眼望见这块碑，注视了许久。读着那篇写得很不自然的碑文，她甚至感动得流泪。那个做丈夫的一定以某种方式毁了他的妻子，因为无可安慰，便把一切美德加到了她的身上。</p> 
<p>将军立起这样一座纪念碑，而且能够面对着它，这也许并不十分奇怪，然而他居然能够如此镇定自若地坐在它的面前，摆出一副如此道貌岸然的神态，无所畏惧地望来望去，不仅如此，他甚至居然敢走进这座教堂，这在凯瑟琳看来却是异乎寻常的。不过，像这样犯了罪还无所谓的例子也并非少见。她能记起几十个干过这种罪恶勾当的人，他们一次又一次地犯罪，想杀谁就杀谁，没有任何人性或悔恨之感，最后不是死于非命，就是皈依隐遁，如此了结这邪恶的一生。她怀疑蒂尔尼夫人是不是真的死了，竖立这么块纪念碑也丝毫不能打消她的怀疑。即使让她下到大家认为藏着蒂尔厄夫人遗骸的墓窖里，让她亲眼瞧见据说盛着她的遗体的棺材，但这又有什么用呢？凯瑟琳看过许多书，完全了解在棺材里放一个蜡人，然后办一场假丧事有多容易。</p> 
<p>第二天早晨，事情有了几分指望。将军的早间散步虽说从别的角度来看不合时宜，但是在这一点上却很有利。凯瑟琳知道将军离开家吃，马上向蒂尔尼小姐提出，要她实践自己的许诺。埃丽诺立刻答应了她的要求。两人动身前往时，凯瑟琳提醒她别忘了还有一项许诺，于是她们决定先去蒂尔尼小姐房里看画像。像上画着一个十分可爱的女人，她面容淑静忧郁，这都证实了这位初来看像的人原先预料的不错。但是，画像并非在各方面都与她预料的相吻合。因为她一心指望见到这样一个女人，她的容貌、神情、面色如果不与亨利相酷似，也应与埃丽诺一模一样。她心目内经常想到的几幅画像，总是显示了母亲与子女的极度相似。一副面孔一旦画出来，便能显现几代人的特征。可在这里，她不得不仔细打量，认真思索，来寻找一点相似之处。然而，尽管存在这个缺欠，她还是满怀深情地注视画像，若不是因为还有更感兴趣的事情，她真要有点恋恋不舍了。</p> 
<p>两人走进大走廊时，凯瑟琳激动得话都说下出来了，只能默默地望着她的伙伴。埃丽诺面色忧郁而镇静。这种镇静自若的神情表明，她对她们正在接近的那些凄惨景象，已经习以为常了。她再次穿过折门，再次抓住了那只大锁。凯瑟琳紧张得几乎连气都透不过来，她战战兢兢、小心翼翼地转身关折门。恰在这时，一个身影，将军那可怕的身影，出现在走廊的尽头，立在她的面前。</p> 
<p>在这同时，将军声嘶力竭地喊了声“埃丽诺”，响彻了整座楼房。他女儿听到喊声才知道父亲来了，凯瑟琳则给吓得心惊胆战。她一看见将军，本能地想躲一躲，然而又明知躲不过他的眼睛。等到她的朋友带着歉然的神情，打她旁边匆匆地跑过去，随着将军走不见了，她连忙跑回自己房里，锁上门躲了起来，心想她决没有勇气再下楼了。她在房里至少呆了一个钟头，心里极度不安，深切怜悯她那可怜的朋友。不知她的处境如何，等待着盛怒的将军传唤自己去他房里。然而，并没来人叫她。最后，眼见一辆马车驶到寺院前，她壮起胆子走下楼，仗着客人的遮护去见将军。客人一到，早餐厅里变得热闹起来。将军向客人介绍说，莫兰小姐是他女儿的朋友，一副恭恭敬敬的神态，把他那满腹怒火掩饰得分毫不露，凯瑟琳觉得自己的性命至少在眼下是保险的。埃丽诺为了维护父亲的人格，极力保持镇定。她一得到机会，便对凯瑟琳说：“我父亲只是叫我回来回复一张便条。”这时，凯瑟琳开始希望：将军或是真没看见她，或是从某种策略考虑，让她自己去这样认为。基于这样的信念，等客人告辞之后。她还依然敢于留在将军面前，而且也没再生什么枝节。</p> 
<p>这天上午，经过考虑，凯瑟琳决定下次单独去闯那道禁门。从各方面看，事情最好不叫埃丽诺知道。让她卷入被再次发现的危险，诱使她走进一间让她心酸的屋子，可不够朋友的情分。将军对她再怎么恼怒，总不像对对他女儿一样。再说，要是没人陪着，探查起来想必会更称心一些。她不可能向埃丽诺道明她的猜疑，因为对方可能侥幸地直到今天也没有起过这种念头。况且，她也不能当着她的面，去搜寻将军残酷无情的证据，这种证据虽然可能尚未被人发现，但她完全有信心在什么地方找到一本日记，断断续续地直写到生命的最后一刻。她现在已经熟悉去那间屋子的路了。她知道亨利明天要回来，而她又希望赶在亨利回来之前了结这桩事，因此不能再耽搁时间了。今天天气晴朗，她也浑身是胆。四点钟的时候，离太阳落山还有两个钟头。她现在就走，别人还会以为她只是比平时早半个钟头去换装。</p> 
<p>她说干就干，钟还没敲完便孤身一人来到了走廊。现在不是思索的时候，她匆匆往前走去，穿过折门时尽量不出动静。接着，也顾不得停下来望一望，或是喘口气，便朝那扇门冲过去。她手一拧，锁打开了，而且很侥幸，没有发出可以惊动人的可怕声音。</p> 
<p>她踮起脚尖走了进去，整个屋子呈现在她面前。但是，她有好一会儿工夫一步也迈不动了。她看见的情景把她定住了，整个面孔都惊傻了。她见到一间又大又匀称的屋子，一张华丽的床上挂着提花布幄帐，铺着提花布被子，女仆悉心地把床铺得像是没人用过一样，不只亮闪闪的巴思火炉，几个桃花木衣橱，几把油漆得很光洁的椅子，夕阳和煦的光线射进两扇窗子，明快地照在椅子上。凯瑟琳早就料到要引起情绪的激动，现在果然激动起来。她</p> 
<p>先是感到惊讶与怀疑，接着，照常理一想，又感到几分苦涩与羞愧。她不可能走错屋子，但是其余的一切都大错特错了，既误解了蒂尔尼小姐的意思，又作出了错误的估计！她原以为这间屋子年代那么久远，经历那么可怕，到头来却是将军的父亲所修建的房子的一端。房里还有两道门，大概．是通向化妆室的，但是她哪个门也不想打开。既然别的渠道都给堵绝了，蒂尔尼夫人最后散步时所戴的面纱，或者最后阅读的书籍，会不会留下来提供点线索呢？不，无论将军犯下了何等罪行，他老奸巨滑的决不会露出破绽。凯瑟琳探索腻了，只想安然地呆在自己房里，唯有她自己知道她做的这些蠢事。她刚要像进来时那样轻手轻脚地走出去，不知道从哪里传来一阵脚步声。吓得她抖抖簌簌地停了下来。让人看见她在这儿，即使是让一个佣人看见了，那也将是很没趣的事。而若是让将军看见了(他总是在最不需要他的时候出现在面前)，那就更糟糕。她留神听了听，脚步声停止了。她决定一刻不耽搁，走出门去，顺手关上。恰在此刻，楼下传来急骤开门的声音，有人似乎正在疾步登上楼梯，而凯瑟琳偏偏还要经过这个楼梯口，才能到达走廊那里。她无力往前走了，带着一种不可名状的恐惧，将目光直溜溜地盯着楼梯。</p> 
<p>过不多久，亨利出现在她面前。“蒂尔尼先生？”她带着异常惊讶的口气喊道：蒂尔尼先生看样子也很惊讶。“天啊！”凯瑟琳继续说道，没留意对方向她打招呼，“你怎么到这儿来了？你怎么从这道楼梯上来了？”</p> 
<p>“我怎么从这楼梯上来？”亨利十分惊奇地回道：“因为从马厩去我房里，数这条路最近。我为什么不从这儿上来呢？”</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳镇静了一下，不觉羞得满脸通红，再也说不出话了。亨利似乎在瞅着她，想以她脸上找到她嘴里不肯提供的解释。凯瑟琳朝走廊走去。“现在是否轮到我，”亨利说道，顺手推开折门。“问问你怎么到这儿来了？从早餐厅去你房里，这至少是一条异乎寻常的通道，就像从马厩去我房里，这道楼梯也很异乎寻常一样。”</p> 
<p>“我是来，”凯瑟琳垂下眼睛说道，“看看你母亲的房间。”</p> 
<p>“我母亲的房间！那里有什么异乎寻常的东西好看吗？”</p> 
<p>“没有，什么也没有。我原以为你明天才会回来。”</p> 
<p>“我离并时，没想到能早点回来。可是三个钟头以前，我高兴地发现没事了，不必逗留了。你脸色苍白。恐怕我上楼跑得太快，让你受惊了。也许你不了解——你不知道这条楼梯是从共用下房那儿通上来的？”</p> 
<p>“是的，我不知道。你今天骑马走路，天气很好吧？”</p> 
<p>“是很好。埃丽诺是不是不管你，让你自己到各个屋里去看看！”</p> 
<p>“哦，不！星期六那天她领着我把大部分屋子都看过了，我们正走到这些屋子这儿，只是，”（压低了声音），“你父亲跟我们在一起。”</p> 
<p>“因此妨碍了你，”亨利说道，恳切地打量着她，“你看过这条过道里的所有屋子没有？”</p> 
<p>“没有。我只想看看——时候不早了吧？我得去换衣服了。”</p> 
<p>“才四点一刻，（拿出手表给她看）“你现在不是在巴思。不必像去戏院或去舞厅那样打扮。在诺桑觉寺，有半个钟头就足够了。”</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳无法反驳，只好硬着头皮不走了。不过，因为害怕亨利再追问，她在他们结交以来，破题儿第一遭想要离开他。他们顺着走廊缓缓走去。“我走了以后，你有没有接到巴思的来信？”</p> 
<p>“没有。我感到很奇怪。伊莎贝拉曾忠实地许诺要马上写信。”</p> 
<p>“忠实地许诺！忠实的许诺！这就叫我疑惑不解了。我听说过忠实的行为，但却没有听说过忠实的诺言----忠实地许诺！不过这是一种不值得知晓的能力，因为它会使你上当，给你带来痛苦。我母亲的房间十分宽敞吧？看上去又大又舒畅，化妆室布置得非常考究。我总觉得，这是全楼最舒适的房间。我很奇怪，埃丽诺为什么不住进去。我想，是她让你来看的吧？”</p> 
<p>“不。”</p> 
<p>“这全是你自己的主意啦？”凯瑟琳没有作声。稍许沉默了一会，亨利仔细地审视着她，然后接着说道：“既然屋子里没有什么可以引起好奇的东西，你的举动一定是出自对我母亲的贤德的敬慕之情。埃丽诺向你讲述过她的贤德，真是让人想起来就感到敬佩。我相信，世界上从未见过比她更贤惠的女人了。但是美德不是经常能引起这种兴趣的。一个默默无闻的女人，在家里表现出一些朴实的美德，并非常常激起这种热烈的崇敬之情，以至于促使别人像你这样去看她的屋子。我想，埃丽诺谈过很多关于我母亲的情况吧？”</p> 
<p>“是的，谈过很多。那就是说——不，不很多。不过她谈到的事情都很有趣。她死得太突然，”(这话说得很缓慢，而且有些吞吞吐吐)“你们——你们一个也不在家。我想，你父亲也许不很喜欢你母亲。”</p> 
<p>“从这些情况出发，”亨利答道，一面用敏锐的目光盯住她的眼睛，“你也许推断八成有点什么过失——有点----(凯瑟琳不由自主地摇摇头)，“或者，也许是一种更加不可宽恕的罪过。”凯瑟琳朝他抬起眼睛，从来没瞪得这么圆过。“我母亲的病，”亨利继续说道，“致她于死地的那次发作，的确很突然。这病本身倒是她常患的一种病：胆热。因此，病因与体质有关。简单说吧，到了第三天。一经把她说通，就请来个医生护理她。那是个非常体面的人，我母亲一向十分信任他。遵照他对我母亲病情危险的看法，第二天又请来了两个人，几乎昼夜不停地护理了二十四小时，第五天，她去世了。在她患病期间，我和弗雷德里克都在家，不断地去看望她。据我们亲眼所见，可以证明我母亲受到了周围人们充满深情的多方关照，或者说，受到了她的社会地位所得到的一切照料。可怜的埃丽诺的确不在家，她离家太远了，赶回来时母亲已经入殓。”</p> 
<p>“可你父亲，”凯瑟琳说，“他感到悲痛吗？”</p> 
<p>“他一度十分悲痛。你错误地以为他不疼爱我母亲。我相信，他是尽他的可能爱着我母亲。你知道，人的性情并非一样温柔体贴，我不敢冒称我母亲在世时用不着经常忍气吞声。不过，虽然我父亲的脾气惹她伤心，可他从未屈枉过她。他真心实意地器重她。他确实为她的死感到悲伤，虽说不够持久。”</p> 
<p>“我听了很高兴，”凯瑟琳说道，“要不然，那就太可怕了。”</p> 
<p>“如果我没理难解错的话，你臆测到一种不可言状的恐怖。。亲爱的莫兰小姐，猜想想你疑神疑鬼的多么令人可怕。你是凭什么来判断的？请记住我们生活的国度和时代。请记住我们是英国人，是基督教徒。请你用脑子分析一下，想想可不可能，看看周围的实际情况。我们受的教养允许我们犯下这种暴行吗？我们的法律能容忍这样的暴行吗？在我们这个社会文化交流如此发达的国家里，每个人周围都有自动监视他的人，加上有公路和报纸传递消息，什么事情都能公布于众。犯下这种暴行怎么能不宣扬出去呢？亲爱的莫兰小姐，你这是动的什么念头啊？”</p> 
<p>他们来到了走廊尽头，凯瑟琳含着羞愧的泪水，跑回自己房里。</p>
