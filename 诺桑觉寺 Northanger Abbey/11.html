A bright morning so early in the year, she allowed, would generally turn to rain, but a cloudy one foretold improvement as the day advanced. She applied to Mr. Allen for confirmation of her hopes, but Mr. Allen, not having his own skies and barometer about him, declined giving any absolute promise of sunshine. She applied to Mrs. Allen, and Mrs. Allen's opinion was more positive. "She had no doubt in the world of its being a very fine day, if the clouds would only go off, and the sun keep out."</p> 
<p>At about eleven o'clock, however, a few specks of small rain upon the windows caught Catherine's watchful eye, and "Oh! dear, I do believe it will be wet," broke from her in a most desponding tone.</p> 
<p>"I thought how it would be," said Mrs. Allen.</p> 
<p>"No walk for me today," sighed Catherine; "but perhaps it may come to nothing, or it may hold up before twelve."</p> 
<p>"Perhaps it may, but then, my dear, it will be so dirty."</p> 
<p>"Oh! That will not signify; I never mind dirt."</p> 
<p>"No," replied her friend very placidly, "I know you never mind dirt."</p> 
<p>After a short pause, "It comes on faster and faster!" said Catherine, as she stood watching at a window.</p> 
<p>"So it does indeed. If it keeps raining, the streets will be very wet."</p> 
<p>"There are four umbrellas up already. How I hate the sight of an umbrella!"</p> 
<p>"They are disagreeable things to carry. I would much rather take a chair at any time."</p> 
<p>"It was such a nice-looking morning! I felt so convinced it would be dry!"</p> 
<p>"Anybody would have thought so indeed. There will be very few people in the pump-room, if it rains all the morning. I hope Mr. Allen will put on his greatcoat when he goes, but I dare say he will not, for he had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat; I wonder he should dislike it, it must be so comfortable."</p> 
<p>The rain continued -- fast, though not heavy. Catherine went every five minutes to the clock, threatening on each return that, if it still kept on raining another five minutes, she would give up the matter as hopeless. The clock struck twelve, and it still rained. "You will not be able to go, my dear."</p> 
<p>"I do not quite despair yet. I shall not give it up till a quarter after twelve. This is just the time of day for it to clear up, and I do think it looks a little lighter. There, it is twenty minutes after twelve, and now I shall give it up entirely. Oh! That we had such weather here as they had at Udolpho, or at least in Tuscany and the south of France! -- the night that poor St. Aubin died! -- such beautiful weather!"</p> 
<p>At half past twelve, when Catherine's anxious attention to the weather was over and she could no longer claim any merit from its amendment, the sky began voluntarily to clear. A gleam of sunshine took her quite by surprise; she looked round; the clouds were parting, and she instantly returned to the window to watch over and encourage the happy appearance. Ten minutes more made it certain that a bright afternoon would succeed, and justified the opinion of Mrs. Allen, who had "always thought it would clear up." But whether Catherine might still expect her friends, whether there had not been too much rain for Miss Tilney to venture, must yet be a question.</p> 
<p>It was too dirty for Mrs. Allen to accompany her husband to the pump-room; he accordingly set off by himself, and Catherine had barely watched him down the street when her notice was claimed by the approach of the same two open carriages, containing the same three people that had surprised her so much a few mornings back.</p> 
<p>"Isabella, my brother, and Mr. Thorpe, I declare! They are coming for me perhaps -- but I shall not go -- I cannot go indeed, for you know Miss Tilney may still call." Mrs. Allen agreed to it. John Thorpe was soon with them, and his voice was with them yet sooner, for on the stairs he was calling out to Miss Morland to be quick. "Make haste! Make haste!" as he threw open the door. "Put on your hat this moment -- there is no time to be lost -- we are going to Bristol. How d'ye do, Mrs. Allen?"</p> 
<p>"To Bristol! Is not that a great way off? But, however, I cannot go with you today, because I am engaged; I expect some friends every moment." This was of course vehemently talked down as no reason at all; Mrs. Allen was called on to second him, and the two others walked in, to give their assistance. "My sweetest Catherine, is not this delightful? We shall have a most heavenly drive. You are to thank your brother and me for the scheme; it darted into our heads at breakfast-time, I verily believe at the same instant; and we should have been off two hours ago if it had not been for this detestable rain. But it does not signify, the nights are moonlight, and we shall do delightfully. Oh! I am in such ecstasies at the thoughts of a little country air and quiet! So much better than going to the Lower Rooms. We shall drive directly to Clifton and dine there; and, as soon as dinner is over, if there is time for it, go on to Kingsweston."</p> 
<p>"I doubt our being able to do so much," said Morland.</p> 
<p>"You croaking fellow!" cried Thorpe. "We shall be able to do ten times more. Kingsweston! Aye, and Blaize Castle too, and anything else we can hear of; but here is your sister says she will not go."</p> 
<p>"Blaize Castle!" cried Catherine. "What is that'?"</p> 
<p>"The finest place in England -- worth going fifty miles at any time to see."</p> 
<p>"What, is it really a castle, an old castle?"</p> 
<p>"The oldest in the kingdom."</p> 
<p>"But is it like what one reads of?"</p> 
<p>"Exactly -- the very same."</p> 
<p>"But now really -- are there towers and long galleries?"</p> 
<p>"By dozens."</p> 
<p>"Then I should like to see it; but I cannot -- I cannot go.</p> 
<p>"Not go! My beloved creature, what do you mean'?"</p> 
<p>"I cannot go, because" -- looking down as she spoke, fearful of Isabella's smile -- "I expect Miss Tilney and her brother to call on me to take a country walk. They promised to come at twelve, only it rained; but now, as it is so fine, I dare say they will be here soon."</p> 
<p>"Not they indeed," cried Thorpe; "for, as we turned into Broad Street, I saw them -- does he not drive a phaeton with bright chestnuts?"</p> 
<p>"I do not know indeed."</p> 
<p>"Yes, I know he does; I saw him. You are talking of the man you danced with last night, are not you?"</p> 
<p>"Yes.</p> 
<p>"Well, I saw him at that moment turn up the Lansdown Road, driving a smart-looking girl."</p> 
<p>"Did you indeed?"</p> 
<p>"Did upon my soul; knew him again directly, and he seemed to have got some very pretty cattle too."</p> 
<p>"It is very odd! But I suppose they thought it would be too dirty for a walk."</p> 
<p>"And well they might, for I never saw so much dirt in my life. Walk! You could no more walk than you could fly! It has not been so dirty the whole winter; it is ankle-deep everywhere."</p> 
<p>Isabella corroborated it: "My dearest Catherine, you cannot form an idea of the dirt; come, you must go; you cannot refuse going now."</p> 
<p>"I should like to see the castle; but may we go all over it? May we go up every staircase, and into every suite of rooms?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, yes, every hole and corner."</p> 
<p>"But then, if they should only be gone out for an hour till it is dryer, and call by and by?"</p> 
<p>"Make yourself easy, there is no danger of that, for I heard Tilney hallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback, that they were going as far as Wick Rocks."</p> 
<p>"Then I will. Shall I go, Mrs. Allen?"</p> 
<p>"Just as you please, my dear."</p> 
<p>"Mrs. Allen, you must persuade her to go," was the general cry. Mrs. Allen was not inattentive to it: "Well, my dear," said she, "suppose you go." And in two minutes they were off.</p> 
<p>Catherine's feelings, as she got into the carriage, were in a very unsettled state; divided between regret for the loss of one great pleasure, and the hope of soon enjoying another, almost its equal in degree, however unlike in kind. She could not think the Tilneys had acted quite well by her, in so readily giving up their engagement, without sending her any message of excuse. It was now but an hour later than the time fixed on for the beginning of their walk; and, in spite of what she had heard of the prodigious accumulation of dirt in the course of that hour, she could not from her own observation help thinking that they might have gone with very little inconvenience. To feel herself slighted by them was very painful. On the other hand, the delight of exploring an edifice like Udolpho, as her fancy represented Blaize Castle to be, was such a counterpoise of good as might console her for almost anything.</p> 
<p>They passed briskly down Pulteney Street, and through Laura Place, without the exchange of many words. Thorpe talked to his horse, and she meditated, by turns, on broken promises and broken arches, phaetons and false hangings, Tilneys and trap-doors. As they entered Argyle Buildings, however, she was roused by this address from her companion, "Who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by?"</p> 
<p>"Who? Where?"</p> 
<p>"On the right-hand pavement -- she must be almost out of sight now." Catherine looked round and saw Miss Tilney leaning on her brother's arm, walking slowly down the street. She saw them both looking back at her. "Stop, stop, Mr. Thorpe," she impatiently cried; "it is Miss Tilney; it is indeed. How could you tell me they were gone? Stop, stop, I will get out this moment and go to them." But to what purpose did she speak? Thorpe only lashed his horse into a brisker trot; the Tilneys, who had soon ceased to look after her, were in a moment out of sight round the corner of Laura Place, and in another moment she was herself whisked into the marketplace. Still, however, and during the length of another street, she entreated him to stop. "Pray, pray stop, Mr. Thorpe. I cannot go on. I will not go on. I must go back to Miss Tilney." But Mr. Thorpe only laughed, smacked his whip, encouraged his horse, made odd noises, and drove on; and Catherine, angry and vexed as she was, having no power of getting away, was obliged to give up the point and submit. Her reproaches, however, were not spared. "How could you deceive me so, Mr. Thorpe? How could you say that you saw them driving up the Lansdown Road? I would not have had it happen so for the world. They must think it so strange, so rude of me! To go by them, too, without saying a word! You do not know how vexed I am; I shall have no pleasure at Clifton, nor in anything else. I had rather, ten thousand times rather, get out now, and walk back to them. How could you say you saw them driving out in a phaeton?" Thorpe defended himself very stoutly, declared he had never seen two men so much alike in his life, and would hardly give up the point of its having been Tilney himself.</p> 
<p>Their drive, even when this subject was over, was not likely to be very agreeable. Catherine's complaisance was no longer what it had been in their former airing. She listened reluctantly, and her replies were short. Blaize Castle remained her only comfort; towards that, she still looked at intervals with pleasure; though rather than be disappointed of the promised walk, and especially rather than be thought ill of by the Tilneys, she would willingly have given up all the happiness which its walls could supply -- the happiness of a progress through a long suite of lofty rooms, exhibiting the remains of magnificent furniture, though now for many years deserted -- the happiness of being stopped in their way along narrow, winding vaults, by a low, grated door; or even of having their lamp, their only lamp, extinguished by a sudden gust of wind, and of being left in total darkness. In the meanwhile, they proceeded on their journey without any mischance, and were within view of the town of Keynsham, when a halloo from Morland, who was behind them, made his friend pull up, to know what was the matter. The others then came close enough for conversation, and Morland said, "We had better go back, Thorpe; it is too late to go on today; your sister thinks so as well as I. We have been exactly an hour coming from Pulteney Street, very little more than seven miles; and, I suppose, we have at least eight more to go. It will never do. We set out a great deal too late. We had much better put it off till another day, and turn round."</p> 
<p>"It is all one to me," replied Thorpe rather angrily; and instantly turning his horse, they were on their way back to Bath.</p> 
<p>"If your brother had not got such a d -- beast to drive," said he soon afterwards, "we might have done it very well. My horse would have trotted to Clifton within the hour, if left to himself, and I have almost broke my arm with pulling him in to that cursed broken-winded jade's pace. Morland is a fool for not keeping a horse and gig of his own."</p> 
<p>"No, he is not," said Catherine warmly, "for I am sure he could not afford it."</p> 
<p>"And why cannot he afford it?"</p> 
<p>"Because he has not money enough."</p> 
<p>"And whose fault is that?"</p> 
<p>"Nobody's, that I know of." Thorpe then said something in the loud, incoherent way to which he had often recourse, about its being a d -- thing to be miserly; and that if people who rolled in money could not afford things, he did not know who could, which Catherine did not even endeavour to understand. Disappointed of what was to have been the consolation for her first disappointment, she was less and less disposed either to be agreeable herself or to find her companion so; and they returned to Pulteney Street without her speaking twenty words.</p> 
<p>As she entered the house, the footman told her that a gentleman and lady had called and inquired for her a few minutes after her setting off; that, when he told them she was gone out with Mr. Thorpe, the lady had asked whether any message had been left for her; and on his saying no, had felt for a card, but said she had none about her, and went away. Pondering over these heart-rending tidings, Catherine walked slowly upstairs. At the head of them she was met by Mr. Allen, who, on hearing the reason of their speedy return, said, "I am glad your brother had so much sense; I am glad you are come back. It was a strange, wild scheme."</p> 
<p>They all spent the evening together at Thorpe's. Catherine was disturbed and out of spirits; but Isabella seemed to find a pool of commerce, in the fate of which she shared, by private partnership with Morland, a very good equivalent for the quiet and country air of an inn at Clifton. Her satisfaction, too, in not being at the Lower Rooms was spoken more than once. "How I pity the poor creatures that are going there! How glad I am that I am not amongst them! I wonder whether it will be a full ball or not! They have not begun dancing yet. I would not be there for all the world. It is so delightful to have an evening now and then to oneself. I dare say it will not be a very good ball. I know the Mitchells will not be there. I am sure I pity everybody that is. But I dare say, Mr. Morland, you long to be at it, do not you? I am sure you do. Well, pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you. I dare say we could do very well without you; but you men think yourselves of such consequence."</p> 
<p>Catherine could almost have accused Isabella of being wanting in tenderness towards herself and her sorrows, so very little did they appear to dwell on her mind, and so very inadequate was the comfort she offered. "Do not be so dull, my dearest creature," she whispered. "You will quite break my heart. It was amazingly shocking, to be sure; but the Tilneys were entirely to blame. Why were not they more punctual? It was dirty, indeed, but what did that signify? I am sure John and I should not have minded it. I never mind going through anything, where a friend is concerned; that is my disposition, and John is just the same; he has amazing strong feelings. Good heavens! What a delightful hand you have got! Kings, I vow! I never was so happy in my life! I would fifty times rather you should have them than myself."</p> 
<p>And now I may dismiss my heroine to the sleepless couch, which is the true heroine's portion; to a pillow strewed with thorns and wet with tears. And lucky may she think herself, if she get another good night's rest in the course of the next three months.</p> 
<p>第二天早晨，天色阴沉沉的，太阳只勉强露了几次脸。凯瑟琳由此断定，一切都令她称心如意。她认为，节气这么早，明朗的清早一般都要转雨，而阴沉的清早则预示着天要逐渐转晴。她请艾伦先生来印证她的看法，可是艾伦先生因为对这里的天气不熟悉，身边又没有晴雨计，不肯断然保证准出太阳。她又向艾伦太太求告，艾伦太太的意见倒比较明确：“假使阴云消散，太阳出来的话，我保险是个大晴天。”</p> 
<p>十一点光景，凯瑟琳那双戒备的眼睛发现窗子上落了几滴细雨，不禁带着万分沮丧的口气嚷道：“哦，天哪！真要下雨了。”</p> 
<p>“我早知道要下雨，”艾伦太太说。</p> 
<p>“我今天散不成步啦，”凯瑟琳叹息道，“不过，也许下不起来，也许十二点以前会停住。”</p> 
<p>“也许会。不过，好孩子，即使那样，路上也会很泥泞的。”</p> 
<p>“噢！那没有关系。我从不怕泥泞。”</p> 
<p>“是的，”她的朋友心平气和地答道，“我知道你不怕泥泞。”</p> 
<p>沉默了一会。“雨越下越急了！”凯瑟琳立在窗口，一边观察一边说道。</p> 
<p>“真的越下越急了。要是不停地下下去，街上就要水汪汪的了。”</p> 
<p>“已经有四把伞撑起来了。我真讨厌见到伞！”</p> 
<p>“带伞就是讨人厌。我宁愿什么时候都坐轿子。”</p> 
<p>“刚才天气还那么好！我还以为准不会下雨呢！”</p> 
<p>“谁不是这么想的。要是下一个上午雨，矿泉厅就不会有什么人了。我希望艾伦先生出去的时候穿上大衣，不过我敢说他不会穿的，因为叫他干什么都行，就是不愿穿上大衣出门。我不知道他怎么这么讨厌穿大衣，穿上大衣一定很不舒服吧。”</p> 
<p>雨继续下着，下得很急，但不是很大。凯瑟琳每隔五分钟就去看看钟，每次回来都扬言：要是再下五分钟，她就死了心不再想这件事了。钟打了十二点，雨还在下。“你走不了啦，亲爱的。”</p> 
<p>“我还没有完全绝望呢。不到十二点一刻，我是不会甘休的。现在正是天该放晴的时候，我真的觉得天色亮了一点。得了，都十二点二十了，我也只有彻底死心了。哦！要是这里能有《尤多尔弗》里描写的那种天气，或者至少能有托斯卡纳和法国南部的那种天气，那该有多好啊！可怜的圣·奥宾死去的那天晚上，天气有多美啊。”</p> 
<p>十二点半的时候，凯瑟琳不再关注天气了，因为即使天晴了，她也没有什么好处可图。而偏偏这时候，天空却自动开始放晴，豁然射进的一缕阳光使她吃了一惊。她四下一看，乌云正在消散。她当即回到窗口，一面观察，一面祝愿太阳快点出来。又过十分钟，看来下午肯定是晴天了，这就证实艾伦太太的看法是正确的，她说她“总觉得天会放晴”。但是，凯瑟琳还能不能期待她的朋友，蒂尔尼小姐会不会因为路上雨水还不太多而贸然出来，一时还不能肯定。</p> 
<p>外面太泥泞，艾伦太太不能陪丈夫去矿泉厅，因此艾伦先生便自己去了。凯瑟琳望着他刚走上街，便立即发现来了两辆敞篷马车，这就是几天前的一个早晨使她大为吃惊的那两辆马车，里面坐着同样的三个人。</p> 
<p>“准是伊莎贝拉、我哥哥和索普先生！他们也许是来找我的，不过我可不去。我实在不能去，因为你知道蒂尔尼小姐还可能来。”艾伦太太同意这个说法。约翰·索普转眼就上来了，不过他的声音上来得还要快，因为他在楼梯上就大声催促凯瑟琳：“快！快！”当他冲开门：“快戴上帽子。别耽误时间了。我们要去布里斯托尔。你好，艾伦太太？”</p> 
<p>“布里斯托尔？那不是很远吗？不过我今天不能跟你们去啦。因为我有约会。我在等几位朋友，他们随时都会来。”当然，这话遭到索普的强烈反驳，认为这根本不成理由。索普还请艾伦太太为他帮忙。这时楼下那两个人也走上来，为他帮腔。“我最心爱的凯瑟琳，难道这还不好玩吗？我们要乘车出去玩个痛快。你要感谢你哥哥和我想出这个点子。我们是吃早饭时突然想到的，我确信是同时想到的。要不是因为这场可恶的雨，我们早就走了两个钟头了。不过这不要紧，夜晚有月亮，我们一定会玩得很愉快的。哦！一想到乡下的空气和宁静，我简直心醉神迷了！这比去下舞厅不知强多少倍。我们乘车直奔克利夫顿，在那儿吃晚饭。一吃完饭，要是有时间，再去金斯韦斯顿。”</p> 
<p>“我不信能走那么多地方。”莫兰说。</p> 
<p>“你这家伙！就爱说不吉利的话！”索普嚷道，“我们能跑十倍多的地方。金斯韦斯顿！当然还有布莱兹城堡，凡是听说过的地方都要去。可这里却好，你妹妹说她不要去。”</p> 
<p>“布莱兹城堡！”凯瑟琳嚷道，“那是什么地方？”</p> 
<p>“英格兰最好的名胜。无论什么时候，都值得跑五十英里去瞧一瞧。”</p> 
<p>“什么！ 真是个城堡？真是个城堡？”</p> 
<p>“王国最古老的城堡。”</p> 
<p>“和书里写的一样吗？”</p> 
<p>“一点不错，完全一样。”</p> 
<p>“不过，真有城楼和长廊吗？”</p> 
<p>“有好几十。”</p> 
<p>“那我倒想去看看。但是不成，我去不了。”</p> 
<p>“去不了！我心爱的宝贝，你这是什么意思？”</p> 
<p>“我去不了，因为”（说话时垂着眼睛，唯恐伊莎贝拉嘲笑她），“我在等蒂尔尼小姐和她哥哥来找我去野外散步。他们答应十二点来。可是下雨了。不过现在天晴了，他们可能马上就会来。”</p> 
<p>“他们才不会来呢，”索普嚷道，“刚才我们走进布罗德街时看见过他们。他是不是驾着一辆四轮敞篷马车，套着栗色马？”</p> 
<p>“我真的不知道。”</p> 
<p>“是的，我知道是的。我看见了。你说的是昨晚跟你跳舞的那个人吧？”</p> 
<p>“是的。”</p> 
<p>“我当时见他赶着车子拐进兰斯当路了，拉着一位时髦的女郎。”</p> 
<p>“真的吗？”</p> 
<p>“真的，我敢对天起誓。我一眼就认出了他。他似乎也有两匹很漂亮的马。”</p> 
<p>“这就怪啦！我想他们一定认为路上太泥泞，不能散步。”</p> 
<p>“那倒很有可能，我生平从没见过路上这么泥泞。散步！那简直比登天还难！整个冬天都没这么泥泞过，到处都齐到脚踝。”</p> 
<p>伊莎贝拉也来作证说：“亲爱的凯瑟琳，你想象不到有多泥泞。得啦，你一定得去，不能拒绝。”</p> 
<p>“我倒想去看看那个城堡。我们能全看一看吗？能登上每节楼梯，走进每个房间吗？”</p> 
<p>“是的，是的，每个角落。”</p> 
<p>“不过，假使他们只是出去一个钟头，等路干点儿再来找我怎么办？”</p> 
<p>“你放心吧，那不可能，因为我听见蒂尔尼对骑马走过的一个人嚷嚷说，他们要到威克岩那儿。”</p> 
<p>“那我就去吧。我可以去吗，艾伦太太？”</p> 
<p>“随你的便，孩子。”</p> 
<p>“艾伦太太，你一定得劝她去，”几个人异口同声地喊道。艾伦太太对此没有置之不理。“唔，孩子，”她说，“你去吧。”不到两分钟，他们便出发了。</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳跨进马车时，心里真不知是什么滋味，一面为失去一次欢聚的乐趣而感到遗憾，一面又希望马上享受到另一个乐趣，两者虽然性质不同，但程度几乎是一样的。她认为蒂尔尼兄妹不该这样待她，也不送个信说明缘故就随便失约。现在，他们比约定散步的时间才过去一个钟头，虽然她听说在这一个钟头里路上积满了泥泞，但她根据自己的观察，认为还是可以去散步的，不会引起什么不便。她觉得自己受到别人的怠慢，心里不禁十分难过。但是，在她的想象中，布莱兹城堡就像尤多尔弗城堡一样，能去那里探索一下倒确是一件十分快乐的事，心里任凭有什么烦恼，这时也能从中得到安慰。</p> 
<p>马车轻快地驶过普尔蒂尼街，穿过劳拉巷。一路上大家很少说话。索普对马说着话，凯瑟琳在沉思默想，时而是失守的约会和失修的拱廊，时而是四轮马车和假帷幔，时而又是蒂尔尼兄妹和活板门。他们进入阿盖尔楼区时，她让同伴的话音惊醒了：“刚才过去了个姑娘使劲盯着你瞧，她是谁？”</p> 
<p>“谁？在哪儿？”</p> 
<p>“在右边的人行道上，现在几乎看不见了。”凯瑟琳回头望去。只见蒂尔尼小姐挽着她哥哥的手臂，慢腾腾地在街上走着。她看见他们两人都在回头望她。“停下．停下，索普先生，”她急火火地嚷道，“那是蒂尔尼小姐，真是她。你凭什么对我说他们出去了？停下，停下，我马上下车，我要去找他们。”可她说了又有什么用？索普只顾抽着马，使它跑得更快了。蒂尔尼兄妹很快不再回头看她了，转眼间便拐进劳拉巷，看不见了。再一转眼。凯瑟琳自己也给拉进了市场巷。但是，直到走完另一条街她还在苦苦恳求索普停车。“我求你，请你停下，索普先生。我不能再去了，我不想再去了。我得回去找蒂尔尼小姐。”索普先生只是哈哈大笑，把鞭子甩得啪啪响，催着马快跑，发出怪里怪气的声音，车子一个劲儿地往前飞奔。凯瑟琳虽说十分恼火，却也没法下车，只好断了念头忍受下去。不过，她也没有少责备索普。“你怎么能这样骗我，索普先生？你怎么能说你看见他们的车子拐进兰斯当路了？我说什么也不愿有这种事发生！他们见我打他们旁边走过时连个招呼也不打，一定会觉得我很奇怪，很无礼！你不知道我有多恼火。我到克利夫顿不会感到快活的，干什么都快活不了。我真想，一万个想现在就下车，走回去找他们。你凭什么说你看见他们坐着四轮敞篷马车出去了？”索普理直气壮地为自己辩解，扬言说他生平从没见过这么相像的两个人，而且还一口咬定就是蒂尔尼先生。</p> 
<p>即使这件事情争过后，这一路上也不可能很愉快了。凯瑟琳不像上次兜风时来得那么客气了。她勉强地听他说话，回答得都-----很简短。布莱兹城堡依然是她唯一的安慰。对于它，她仍旧不时地抱有一种愉快的期待感。在古堡里，她可以穿过一长列巍峨的房间，里面陈设着一些残遗的豪华家具。现已多年无人居住，沿着狭窄迂回的地窖走去，蓦然被一道低栅栏挡住去路，甚至他们的油灯，他们唯一的油灯，被一阵突如其来的疾风吹灭、他们当即陷入一团漆黑。这些都是游历古堡时可以得到的乐趣。但是凯瑟琳宁可放弃这一切乐趣，也不愿意错过这次约好了的散步，尤其不愿意给蒂尔尼兄妹留下一个坏印象。其间，他们还在平安地赶路。当基恩沙姆镇在望的对候，后头的莫兰突然喊了一声，他的朋友只得勒住马，看看出了什么事。这时那两个人走上前来，只听莫兰说：“我们最好还是回去吧，索普。今天太晚了，不能再往前走了。你妹妹和我都这么想。我们从普尔蒂尼出来已经整整一个钟头了，才只走了七英里。我想，我们至少还得走八英里。这万万使不得。我们出来得太晚了。最好改天再去，现在往回转。”</p> 
<p>“这对我都一样，”索普悻悻地答道。当即调转马头，起程回巴思。</p> 
<p>“假使你哥哥不是赶着那么一匹该死的马，”他歇了不久说道，“我们可能早到了。我的马要是任着它跑，一个钟头就能赶到克利夫顿。为了不落下那匹该死的直喘大气的驽马，我一直勒住我的马，差一点把胳膊都拽断了。莫兰真是个傻瓜，不自己养一匹马，买一辆双轮轻便马车。”</p> 
<p>“不，他不是傻瓜，”凯瑟琳激越地说，“我知道他养不起。”</p> 
<p>“他为什么养不起？”</p> 
<p>“因为他没有那么多的钱。”</p> 
<p>“那怪谁呀？”</p> 
<p>“我想谁也不怪。”</p> 
<p>这时，索普像往常一样，又扯起嗓子，语无伦次地絮叨起来，说什么吝啬是多么可悲的事情，要是在钱堆里打滚的人都买不起东西，他不知道谁还买得起。对于他这话，凯瑟琳甚至都不想搞懂意思。这次游览本来是要为她的第一个失望带来宽慰的，不想现在又叫她失望了，因而她也就越来越没有心思敷衍地的伙伴了，同时也觉得他越来越叫人讨厌。直至回到普尔蒂尼街，她一路上总共说了不到二十句话。</p> 
<p>进屋时，男仆告诉她，她走后不到几分钟，有一位先生和一位小姐来找她，当他告诉他们她同索普先生出去了时，那位小姐便问有没有给她留话，一听说没有，就在身上摸名片，后来说她没带，便告辞了。凯瑟琳思索着这些叫人心碎的消息，慢腾腾地走上楼。到了楼梯顶，遇见艾伦先生。他一听说他们为什么回来得这么快，便说道：“我很高兴你哥哥如此理智。你回来得好。这本来就是个十分轻率的怪主意。”</p> 
<p>那天晚上，大家是在索普太太寓所度过的。凯瑟琳心烦意乱，闷闷不乐。但是伊莎贝拉似乎觉得，和莫兰搭档打打康默斯，完全可以和克利夫顿客店里静谧的乡间风味相媲美。她不止一次地表示，她很高兴自己没去下舞厅。“我真可怜那些往那儿跑的可怜虫！我很高兴我没夹在他们当中！我怀疑会有多少人参加舞会！他们还没开始跳舞呢。我是绝对不会去的。自己不时地清闲自在地过个晚上，那有多愉快。我敢说．那个舞会不会有多大意思。我知道，米切尔家就不会去。我真可怜那些去的人。不过我敢说，莫兰先生，你很想去跳舞，对吧？你肯定想去。那么，就请吧，这屋里可没人阻拦你。我敢说，你不在，我们照样可以过得很愉快。你们男人就觉得自己了不起。”</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳简直想责备伊莎贝拉对她和她的烦恼一点也不体谅。她似乎根本不把她和她的烦恼放在心上，她那些安慰她的话说得实在不得要领。“别这么垂头丧气的，我的宝贝，”她低声说道，“你简直要把我的心撕碎了。这件事太不像话了。不过全怪蒂尔尼兄妹。他们干嘛不准时一点？不错，路上泥泞，可那算得了什么？约翰和我肯定不会在乎的。为了朋友，我是赴汤蹈火都在所不辞的。这是我的性格，约翰也是如此，他是个极重感情的人。天哪！你这手牌太好啦！居然全是老K！我从没这么高兴过！我一百个希望你捞到这手牌，这比我自己捞着还让我高兴。”</p> 
<p>现在。我该打发我的女主角上床去辗转反侧，感伤垂泪了，因为真正的女主角大都命该如此。假若她能在三个月之内睡上一夜安稳觉，她便会觉得自己十分幸运了。</p>
