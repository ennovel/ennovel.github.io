Everybody acquainted with Bath may remember the difficulties of crossing Cheap Street at this point; it is indeed a street of so impertinent a nature, so unfortunately connected with the great London and Oxford roads, and the principal inn of the city, that a day never passes in which parties of ladies, however important their business, whether in quest of pastry, millinery, or even (as in the present case) of young men, are not detained on one side or other by carriages, horsemen, or carts. This evil had been felt and lamented, at least three times a day, by Isabella since her residence in Bath; and she was now fated to feel and lament it once more, for at the very moment of coming opposite to Union Passage, and within view of the two gentlemen who were proceeding through the crowds, and threading the gutters of that interesting alley, they were prevented crossing by the approach of a gig, driven along on bad pavement by a most knowing-looking coachman with all the vehemence that could most fitly endanger the lives of himself, his companion, and his horse.</p> 
<p>"Oh, these odious gigs!" said Isabella, looking up. "How I detest them." But this detestation, though so just, was of short duration, for she looked again and exclaimed, "Delightful! Mr. Morland and my brother!"</p> 
<p>"Good heaven! 'Tis James!" was uttered at the same moment by Catherine; and, on catching the young men's eyes, the horse was immediately checked with a violence which almost threw him on his haunches, and the servant having now scampered up, the gentlemen jumped out, and the equipage was delivered to his care.</p> 
<p>Catherine, by whom this meeting was wholly unexpected, received her brother with the liveliest pleasure; and he, being of a very amiable disposition, and sincerely attached to her, gave every proof on his side of equal satisfaction, which he could have leisure to do, while the bright eyes of Miss Thorpe were incessantly challenging his notice; and to her his devoirs were speedily paid, with a mixture of joy and embarrassment which might have informed Catherine, had she been more expert in the development of other people's feelings, and less simply engrossed by her own, that her brother thought her friend quite as pretty as she could do herself.</p> 
<p>John Thorpe, who in the meantime had been giving orders about the horses, soon joined them, and from him she directly received the amends which were her due; for while he slightly and carelessly touched the hand of Isabella, on her he bestowed a whole scrape and half a short bow. He was a stout young man of middling height, who, with a plain face and ungraceful form, seemed fearful of being too handsome unless he wore the dress of a groom, and too much like a gentleman unless he were easy where he ought to be civil, and impudent where he might be allowed to be easy. He took out his watch: "How long do you think we have been running it from Tetbury, Miss Morland?"</p> 
<p>"I do not know the distance." Her brother told her that it was twenty-three miles.</p> 
<p>"Three and twenty!" cried Thorpe. "Five and twenty if it is an inch." Morland remonstrated, pleaded the authority of road-books, innkeepers, and milestones; but his friend disregarded them all; he had a surer test of distance. "I know it must be five and twenty," said he, "by the time we have been doing it. It is now half after one; we drove out of the inn-yard at Tetbury as the town clock struck eleven; and I defy any man in England to make my horse go less than ten miles an hour in harness; that makes it exactly twenty-five."</p> 
<p>"You have lost an hour," said Morland; "it was only ten o'clock when we came from Tetbury."</p> 
<p>"Ten o'clock! It was eleven, upon my soul! I counted every stroke. This brother of yours would persuade me out of my senses, Miss Morland; do but look at my horse; did you ever see an animal so made for speed in your life?" (The servant had just mounted the carriage and was driving off.) "Such true blood! Three hours and and a half indeed coming only three and twenty miles! Look at that creature, and suppose it possible if you can."</p> 
<p>"He does look very hot, to be sure."</p> 
<p>"Hot! He had not turned a hair till we came to Walcot Church; but look at his forehand; look at his loins; only see how he moves; that horse cannot go less than ten miles an hour: tie his legs and he will get on. What do you think of my gig, Miss Morland? A neat one, is not it? Well hung; town-built; I have not had it a month. It was built for a Christchurch man, a friend of mine, a very good sort of fellow; he ran it a few weeks, till, I believe, it was convenient to have done with it. I happened just then to be looking out for some light thing of the kind, though I had pretty well determined on a curricle too; but I chanced to meet him on Magdalen Bridge, as he was driving into Oxford, last term: 'Ah! Thorpe,' said he, 'do you happen to want such a little thing as this? It is a capital one of the kind, but I am cursed tired of it.' 'Oh! D -- ,' said I; 'I am your man; what do you ask?' And how much do you think he did, Miss Morland?"</p> 
<p>"I am sure I cannot guess at all."</p> 
<p>"Curricle-hung, you see; seat, trunk, sword-case, splashing-board, lamps, silver moulding, all you see complete; the iron-work as good as new, or better. He asked fifty guineas; I closed with him directly, threw down the money, and the carriage was mine."</p> 
<p>"And I am sure," said Catherine, "I know so little of such things that I cannot judge whether it was cheap or dear."</p> 
<p>"Neither one nor t'other; I might have got it for less, I dare say; but I hate haggling, and poor Freeman wanted cash."</p> 
<p>"That was very good-natured of you," said Catherine, quite pleased.</p> 
<p>"Oh! D -- it, when one has the means of doing a kind thing by a friend, I hate to be pitiful."</p> 
<p>An inquiry now took place into the intended movements of the young ladies; and, on finding whither they were going, it was decided that the gentlemen should accompany them to Edgar's Buildings, and pay their respects to Mrs. Thorpe. James and Isabella led the way; and so well satisfied was the latter with her lot, so contentedly was she endeavouring to ensure a pleasant walk to him who brought the double recommendation of being her brother's friend, and her friend's brother, so pure and uncoquettish were her feelings, that, though they overtook and passed the two offending young men in Milsom Street, she was so far from seeking to attract their notice, that she looked back at them only three times.</p> 
<p>John Thorpe kept of course with Catherine, and, after a few minutes' silence, renewed the conversation about his gig. "You will find, however, Miss Morland, it would be reckoned a cheap thing by some people, for I might have sold it for ten guineas more the next day; Jackson, of Oriel, bid me sixty at once; Morland was with me at the time."</p> 
<p>"Yes," said Morland, who overheard this; "but you forget that your horse was included."</p> 
<p>"My horse! Oh, d -- it! I would not sell my horse for a hundred. Are you fond of an open carriage, Miss Morland?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, very; I have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one; but I am particularly fond of it."</p> 
<p>"I am glad of it; I will drive you out in mine every day."</p> 
<p>"Thank you," said Catherine, in some distress, from a doubt of the propriety of accepting such an offer.</p> 
<p>"I will drive you up Lansdown Hill tomorrow."</p> 
<p>"Thank you; but will not your horse want rest?"</p> 
<p>"Rest! He has only come three and twenty miles today; all nonsense; nothing ruins horses so much as rest; nothing knocks them up so soon. No, no; I shall exercise mine at the average of four hours every day while I am here."</p> 
<p>"Shall you indeed!" said Catherine very seriously. "That will be forty miles a day."</p> 
<p>"Forty! Aye, fifty, for what I care. Well, I will drive you up Lansdown tomorrow; mind, I am engaged."</p> 
<p>"How delightful that will be!" cried Isabella, turning round. "My dearest Catherine, I quite envy you; but I am afraid, brother, you will not have room for a third."</p> 
<p>"A third indeed! No, no; I did not come to Bath to drive my sisters about; that would be a good joke, faith! Morland must take care of you."</p> 
<p>This brought on a dialogue of civilities between the other two; but Catherine heard neither the particulars nor the result. Her companion's discourse now sunk from its hitherto animated pitch to nothing more than a short decisive sentence of praise or condemnation on the face of every woman they met; and Catherine, after listening and agreeing as long as she could, with all the civility and deference of the youthful female mind, fearful of hazarding an opinion of its own in opposition to that of a self-assured man, especially where the beauty of her own sex is concerned, ventured at length to vary the subject by a question which had been long uppermost in her thoughts; it was, "Have you ever read Udolpho, Mr. Thorpe?"</p> 
<p>"Udolpho! Oh, Lord! Not I; I never read novels; I have something else to do."</p> 
<p>Catherine, humbled and ashamed, was going to apologize for her question, but he prevented her by saying, "Novels are all so full of nonsense and stuff; there has not been a tolerably decent one come out since Tom Jones, except The Monk; I read that t'other day; but as for all the others, they are the stupidest things in creation."</p> 
<p>"I think you must like Udolpho, if you were to read it; it is so very interesting."</p> 
<p>"Not I, faith! No, if I read any, it shall be Mrs. Radcliffe's; her novels are amusing enough; they are worth reading; some fun and nature in them."</p> 
<p>"Udolpho was written by Mrs. Radcliffe," said Catherine, with some hesitation, from the fear of mortifying him.</p> 
<p>"No sure; was it? Aye, I remember, so it was; I was thinking of that other stupid book, written by that woman they make such a fuss about, she who married the French emigrant."</p> 
<p>"I suppose you mean Camilla?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, that's the book; such unnatural stuff! An old man playing at see-saw, I took up the first volume once and looked it over, but I soon found it would not do; indeed I guessed what sort of stuff it must be before I saw it: as soon as I heard she had married an emigrant, I was sure I should never be able to get through it."</p> 
<p>"I have never read it."</p> 
<p>"You had no loss, I assure you; it is the horridest nonsense you can imagine; there is nothing in the world in it but an old man's playing at see-saw and learning Latin; upon my soul there is not."</p> 
<p>This critique, the justness of which was unfortunately lost on poor Catherine, brought them to the door of Mrs. Thorpe's lodgings, and the feelings of the discerning and unprejudiced reader of Camilla gave way to the feelings of the dutiful and affectionate son, as they met Mrs. Thorpe, who had descried them from above, in the passage. "Ah, Mother! How do you do?" said he, giving her a hearty shake of the hand. "Where did you get that quiz of a hat? It makes you look like an old witch. Here is Morland and I come to stay a few days with you, so you must look out for a couple of good beds somewhere near." And this address seemed to satisfy all the fondest wishes of the mother's heart, for she received him with the most delighted and exulting affection. On his two younger sisters he then bestowed an equal portion of his fraternal tenderness, for he asked each of them how they did, and observed that they both looked very ugly.</p> 
<p>These manners did not please Catherine; but he was James's friend and Isabella's brother; and her judgment was further bought off by Isabella's assuring her, when they withdrew to see the new hat, that John thought her the most charming girl in the world, and by John's engaging her before they parted to dance with him that evening. Had she been older or vainer, such attacks might have done little; but, where youth and diffidence are united, it requires uncommon steadiness of reason to resist the attraction of being called the most charming girl in the world, and of being so very early engaged as a partner; and the consequence was that, when the two Morlands, after sitting an hour with the Thorpes, set off to walk together to Mr. Allen's, and James, as the door was closed on them, said, "Well, Catherine, how do you like my friend Thorpe?" instead of answering, as she probably would have done, had there been no friendship and no flattery in the case, "I do not like him at all," she directly replied, "I like him very much; he seems very agreeable."</p> 
<p>"He is as good-natured a fellow as ever lived; a little of a rattle; but that will recommend him to your sex, I believe: and how do you like the rest of the family?"</p> 
<p>"Very, very much indeed: Isabella particularly."</p> 
<p>"I am very glad to hear you say so; she is just the kind of young woman I could wish to see you attached to; she has so much good sense, and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable; I always wanted you to know her; and she seems very fond of you. She said the highest things in your praise that could possibly be; and the praise of such a girl as Miss Thorpe even you, Catherine," taking her hand with affection, "may be proud of."</p> 
<p>"Indeed I am," she replied; "I love her exceedingly, and am delighted to find that you like her too. You hardly mentioned anything of her when you wrote to me after your visit there."</p> 
<p>"Because I thought I should soon see you myself. I hope you will be a great deal together while you are in Bath. She is a most amiable girl; such a superior understanding! How fond all the family are of her; she is evidently the general favourite; and how much she must be admired in such a place as this -- is not she?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, very much indeed, I fancy; Mr. Allen thinks her the prettiest girl in Bath."</p> 
<p>"I dare say he does; and I do not know any man who is a better judge of beauty than Mr. Allen. I need not ask you whether you are happy here, my dear Catherine; with such a companion and friend as Isabella Thorpe, it would be impossible for you to be otherwise; and the Allens, I am sure, are very kind to you?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, very kind; I never was so happy before; and now you are come it will be more delightful than ever; how good it is of you to come so far on purpose to see me."</p> 
<p>James accepted this tribute of gratitude, and qualified his conscience for accepting it too, by saying with perfect sincerity, "Indeed, Catherine, I love you dearly."</p> 
<p>Inquiries and communications concerning brothers and sisters, the situation of some, the growth of the rest, and other family matters now passed between them, and continued, with only one small digression on James's part, in praise of Miss Thorpe, till they reached Pulteney Street, where he was welcomed with great kindness by Mr. and Mrs. Allen, invited by the former to dine with them, and summoned by the latter to guess the price and weigh the merits of a new muff and tippet. A pre-engagement in Edgar's Buildings prevented his accepting the invitation of one friend, and obliged him to hurry away as soon as he had satisfied the demands of the other. The time of the two parties uniting in the Octagon Room being correctly adjusted, Catherine was then left to the luxury of a raised, restless, and frightened imagination over the pages of Udolpho, lost from all worldly concerns of dressing and dinner, incapable of soothing Mrs. Allen's fears on the delay of an expected dressmaker, and having only one minute in sixty to bestow even on the reflection of her own felicity, in being already engaged for the evening.</p> 
<p>半分钟工夫，两位小姐穿过矿泉院，来到联盟路对面的拱廊底下，不想在这儿给挡住了去路。凡是熟悉巴思的人都会记得，要在这个地方穿过奇普街，真是困难重重。这的确是一条很伤脑筋的街道，偏巧连着去伦敦和牛津的大道以及城里的大旅馆、因此不管哪一天，一群群的妇女无论有多么重要的事情，无论是去买发面饼、女帽，还是像眼下这样去追赶小伙子，总要在街边给拦住，让马车、骑马人或大车先过去。伊莎贝拉自从来到巴思以后，这种苦头每天至少要吃三次，每次都要哀叹一番。现在，她注定要再吃一次苦头，再哀叹一番。且说她们刚来到联盟路对面，便望见那两位绅士正在那条别有风味的小巷里绕着边沟，穿过人群往前走。恰在这当儿，偏偏来了一辆双轮轻便马车，挡住了她们的去路。赶车的是一个非常神气的人，赶着车在高低不平的街道上猛跑，随时可能危及到他自己、他的伙伴和那匹马的性命。</p> 
<p>“噢！这些讨厌的马车！”伊莎贝拉举目望了望说。“我对它们憎恶极啦！”然而，她的憎恶尽管理由充分，但持续的时间却不长，因为她再定睛一看，不禁惊叫起来：“太好了！原来是莫兰先生和我哥哥！”</p> 
<p>“天哪！是詹姆斯！”凯瑟琳同时嚷道。两位年轻人一看见她们，便猛地一下勒住了马。险些没把它蹲倒。仆人急忙赶了来，两位先生跳下车，把马车交给他照料。</p> 
<p>这次相遇完全出乎凯瑟琳的意料，她欣喜若狂地迎接哥哥。这位哥哥是个性情非常和蔼的人，对妹妹十分钟爱，因而同样表现得很高兴。当他尽情表露自己的喜悦之情时，索普小组那双亮晶晶的眼睛一直在朝他溜来溜去，想勾起他的注意。随即，莫兰先生带着半喜半窘的神情，向索普小姐问起好来。假若凯瑟琳能善于揣摸别人感情的发展脉络，而不要仅仅沉湎于自己的感情之中，那她或许会认识到：同她自己一样，她哥哥也认为她的女友十分漂亮。</p> 
<p>这当儿，约翰·索普先是在吩咐马的事，随后也走过来，凯瑟琳马上得到了应有的补偿，因为他一面漫不经心地轻轻拉了拉伊莎贝拉的手，一面笨拙地将一条腿往后一退，另一条腿一弯曲，向凯瑟琳微微鞠了个躬。他是个体魄健壮的青年，中等身材，面貌粗俗，体态笨拙。他似乎唯恐自己太漂亮，所以就穿了一身马夫的衣服，唯恐自己太文雅，所以便在应该讲究礼貌的时候表现得十分随便，在可以随便一点的时候又表现得十分放肆。他掏出表，说道：“‘你猜我们从泰特布里到这儿走了多少时间，莫兰小姐？”</p> 
<p>“我不知道有多远。”她哥哥告诉她是二十三英里。</p> 
<p>“二十三！”索普大声嚷道，“足有二十五英里。”莫兰加以分辩，而且搬出了旅行指南、旅店老板和里程碑作证据。可是，他的朋友全不把这些放在眼里，他有个更稳妥的距离测量法。“根据路上的时间来计算，”他说，“我敢肯定是二十五英里。现在是一点半，城里的钟打十一点的时候，我们从泰特布里旅馆的院子里赶车出来。全英格兰有谁敢说我的马套上车每小时走不到十英里。这不恰好是二十五英里。”</p> 
<p>“你少说了一个钟头，”莫兰说，“我们离开泰特布里的时候，才十点钟。”</p> 
<p>“十点！肯定是十一点！我把钟声一下下都数过了。莫兰小姐，你这位哥哥是想把我搅糊涂啊。你只要瞧瞧我的马，你生平见过这么快的马吗？”(</p> 
<p>仆人刚刚跳上马车，准备赶开。)“这样出色的纯种马！说什么三个半钟头只跑了二十三英里！瞧瞧那匹马，你认为这可能吗？”</p> 
<p>“看样子的确汗淋淋的！”</p> 
<p>“汗淋淋的！我们直到沃尔考特教堂，它都没倒一根毛。你瞧瞧它的前身，瞧瞧它的腰，只要看看它走路的姿态。它不可能一个钟头走不了十英里。把它的腿捆起来，它也能往前走。你觉得我这辆马车怎么样，莫兰小姐？轻巧吧？弹性真好，是城里造的。我买了还不到一个月。本来是给基督教会学院①的一个人定做的，那是我的一个朋友，人很不错。他用了几个星期，后来想必手头紧了，就想脱手。恰在这时，我想找一辆轻便马车，虽然有双马拉的我也想买。说来也巧，上学期我在马格达仑桥上遇见了他，他正赶车去牛津。‘哦！索普，’他说，‘你想不想买这么一辆小车子？这类车里它算最棒的了，不过我可用腻了。’‘噢！该死，’我说，‘我买了。你要什么价？’莫兰小姐，你猜他要了多少？”</p> 
<p>“我当然猜不着。”</p> 
<p>“你瞧，完全是双马双轮马车的装潢：座子、行李箱、剑匣、挡泥板、车灯、银镶线，你瞧，一应俱全。那铁制部件跟新的一样，甚至比新的还好。他要五十几尼。我当即同他拍板成交，把钱一扔．这车就归我了。”</p> 
<p>“的确，”凯瑟琳说，“我对这种事一无所知，无法断定究竟是便宜还是贵。”</p> 
<p>“既不便宜也不贵。也许我可以少出点钱，但我不喜欢讨价还价，再说可怜的弗里曼需要现钱。”</p> 
<p>“你心眼真好，”凯瑟琳十分高兴地说道。</p> 
<p>“噢，该死！在有能力为朋友帮点忙的时候，我讨厌小里小气的。”</p> 
<p>这时，两位先生问起两位小姐打算到哪儿去，问明之后，便决定陪她们一起去埃德加大楼，顺便拜访一下索普太太。詹姆斯和伊莎贝拉在前面引路。伊莎贝拉觉得自己十分走运，眼前这位先生既是她哥哥的朋友，又是她朋友的哥哥，心里一高兴，免不了要想方设法让他一路上愉愉快快的。她的心情是那样纯洁，丝毫没有卖弄风骚的意味，因此，当他们在米尔萨姆街赶过那两个讨人嫌的年轻人时，她全然不想去挑逗他们的注意力，只不过回头望了他们三次。</p> 
<p>约翰·索普当然是和凯瑟琳走在一起啦。沉默了几分钟之后，他又谈起了他的双轮轻便马车：“你将发现，莫兰小姐，有些人还是会认为我买了个便宜货，因为第二天我本来可以一转手多卖十几尼的。奥里尔的杰克逊一开口就给我六十几尼。当时莫兰也在场。”</p> 
<p>“是的，”莫兰无意中听见了，说道。“不过你忘了，还包括你的马呢。”</p> 
<p>“我的马！哦，该死！我的马给我一百几尼我也不卖。莫兰小姐，你喜欢敞篷马车吗？”</p> 
<p>“是的，非常喜欢。这种马车我一直没有机会乘，不过我倒是特别喜欢的。”</p> 
<p>“那好极了。我每天都可以让你乘我的车出去。”</p> 
<p>“谢谢，”凯瑟琳答道。她心里有些忐忑不安，不知道接受这样的好意是否妥当。</p> 
<p>“我明天就带你上兰斯当山。”</p> 
<p>“谢谢你。可是你的马不要歇歇吗？”</p> 
<p>“歇歇！它今天才走了二十三英里。真是胡说八道。歇息最伤马不过了，也使马疲乏得最快。不，不能歇。我平均每天要让马运动四个钟头。”；</p> 
<p>“真的吗？”凯瑟琳认真地说道。“那就是一天四十英里啊。”</p> 
<p>“四十!哼，说不定有五十英里呢。好了，我明天带你上兰斯当山。记住，我可跟你约定啦。”</p> 
<p>“那该多有意思啊！”伊莎贝拉转过身，大声嚷道，“亲爱的凯瑟琳，我真羡慕你。不过，哥哥，你车上坐不下第三个人吧？”</p> 
<p>“什么第三个人！当然坐不下。我来巴思不是为了带着妹妹四处兜风的。那岂不要成为笑话！莫兰会照应你的。”</p> 
<p>那两个人听了这话，互相客气了一番，但是具体说了些什么话，最后决定怎么办，凯瑟琳并没听见。她的同伴刚才那股兴致勃勃的谈锋现在消沉了，只有见到女人的时候才对其容貌断然品评一声，话语简短，褒贬分明。凯瑟琳带着年轻女性的谦逊与恭敬，尽可能洗耳恭听，随声附和，唯恐以自己的妇人之见唐突了一个充满自信的男人，特别是在牵涉到女性的美貌这样一个话题上。最后，她终于鼓起勇气，将话锋一转，提出了她心里思忖了很久的一个大问题：“你看过《尤多尔弗》吗，索普先生？”</p> 
<p>“《尤多尔弗》！噢，天哪！没着过。我从不看小说，我还有别的事要干。”</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳觉得十分羞愧，正想道歉，不料约翰把她打断了：“小说里尽是胡说八道！自从《汤姆·琼斯》②以后，就没有一本像样的小说，只有《僧人》③除外。我几天前看过这本书。至于别的小说，全都是些无聊透顶的作品。”</p> 
<p>“我想你若是看看《尤多尔弗》，一定会喜欢的。这本书有趣极了。”</p> 
<p>“老实说，我才不看呢！我要是看小说，那就看拉德克利夫夫人的。她的小说倒挺有意思，值得一读！那里边还多少有点逗趣的内容和对大自然的描写。”</p> 
<p>“《尤多尔弗》就是拉德克利夫夫人写的，””凯瑟琳说道。她这话说得有点犹豫．唯恐让对方下不了台。</p> 
<p>“绝对不可能。真是她写的？噢，我记起来了，是她写的。我刚才想到另外一本无聊的书上了，就是那个被人们捧上了天的女人④写的。她嫁给了那位法国移民。”</p> 
<p>“我想你指的是《加米拉》吧！”</p> 
<p>“对，就是那本书。简直是胡诌八扯！一个老头子玩跷跷板！有一次我拿起第一卷，随便看了看，立刻发现不行。的确，我还没见到书就猜到里面是什么货色了。我一听说它的作者嫁给了个移民，就准知道我无论如何也看不下下去。”</p> 
<p>“我从没看过这本书。”</p> 
<p>“那你一点也不亏。尽管放心好了。那书真是无聊透了。什么内容也没有，就是一个老头子在玩跷跷板，学拉丁文，直是空洞透顶”。</p> 
<p>不幸的是，这席公允的评论并没对可怜的凯瑟琳产生任何影响。说话间，大家来到了索普太太的寓所门前。索普太太从楼上发现了他们，便到走廊上来迎接。等见了索普太太，那位《加米拉》读者的那些敏锐而公允的情感消失了，代之而来的是一颗恭敬而亲热的孝子之心。“哦</p> 
<p>，妈妈！您好！”。索普说道，一面亲切地同她握手。“你从哪儿搞到了那么一顶怪帽子！你戴着它真像个老巫婆。莫兰和我来家陪你住几天，因此你得在附近给我们找个好地方睡。"做母亲的听了这话，溺爱子女的一片心意似乎得到了满足，因为她是怀着欣喜万分和宠爱备至的心情来接待儿子的。随即，索普对两个小妹妹表现得同样很亲热，一个个向她们问好，还说两人样子真丑。</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳并不喜欢这种言谈举止。但是，索普毕竟是詹姆斯的朋友，伊莎贝拉的哥哥。再加上出去看帽子的时候，伊莎贝拉对她说，约翰认为她是天下最迷人的姑娘；而在临分手之前，约翰又约她当天晚上同他跳舞；因此她就改变了先前的看法。假若凯瑟琳年纪稍大一些，虚荣心稍强一些，这种攻势也许不会产生什么效果。但是，一个既年轻又羞怯的少女，在被人夸作天下最迷人的姑娘，被人老早就约作舞伴的时候，她只有异常坚定、异常理智，才能做到无动于衷。且说莫兰兄妹同索普家的人坐了一个钟头之后，便起身一道去艾伦先生府上。主人刚关上门，詹姆斯便说：“凯瑟琳，你觉得我的朋友索普怎么样？”假如这其中不存在友谊，而她又没有受到恭维的话，她很可能回答说：“我一点也不喜欢他。"</p> 
<p>但她如今马上答道：“我很喜欢他。他看上去十分和蔼。”</p> 
<p>“他是个顶和气的人，只是有点喋喋不休，不过我想这会博得你们女人的欢心。你喜欢他们家的人吗？”</p> 
<p>“很喜欢，的确很喜欢，尤其是伊莎贝拉。”</p> 
<p>“我很高兴听你这么说。我就希望见你亲近她这样的年轻女人。她富有理智，一点也不做作，十分和蔼可亲。我总想让你结识她。她似乎很喜欢你，对你极为赞赏。能受到索普小姐这样一位姑娘的赞赏，即使你，凯瑟琳，”亲昵地握住她的手，“也会感到自豪。”</p> 
<p>“我的确感到自豪，”凯瑟琳答道，“我极其喜爱她，我很高兴你也喜欢她。你去他们家以后，给我写信的时候怎么一句也没提到她？”</p> 
<p>“因为我想我马上就会见到你的。我希望你们在巴思期间，能经常呆在一起。她是个极其和蔼可亲的姑娘，那么聪明过人！她们全家人都喜爱她，她显然是全家人的宠幸。在这样一个地方，一定有不少人爱慕她，你说是不是？”</p> 
<p>“是的，我想一定会有很多人。艾伦先生认为她是巴思最漂亮的姑娘。”</p> 
<p>"我想他是这么认为的。我不知道有谁能比艾伦先生更善于审美。亲爱的凯瑟琳，我不必问你在这里过得是否愉快。有伊莎贝拉、索普这样的朋友作伴，你不可能不愉快。毫无疑问，艾伦夫妇待你一定很好。”</p> 
<p>“是很好。我以前从没有这么愉快过。现在你来了。那就更令人愉快了。你可真好，特意跑这么远来看我。”</p> 
<p>詹姆斯接受了这番感激之词，而且，为了使良心上也受之无愧，还情恳意切地说道：“凯瑟琳。我实在太爱你了。”</p> 
<p>兄妹俩一问一答地谈起了兄弟姊妹的情况，这几个在做什么，那几个发育得怎么样，以及其他家务事。除了詹姆斯打岔夸赞了索普小姐一声以外，他们一直在谈论这些事情。到了普尔蒂尼街。詹姆斯受到艾伦夫妇的盛情招待，男的留他吃饭、女的请他猜猜她新买的皮笼和披肩要多少钱，权衡一下它们的优点。詹姆斯因为和埃德加大楼那边有约在先，无法接受艾伦先生的邀请，只好一满足艾伦太太的要求、便勿匆告辞。两家在八角厅会面的时间既然订准了，凯瑟琳便可带着惊恐不安的心情，张开想象的翅膀，尽情欣赏她的《尤多尔弗》，把整装吃饭的一切人间琐事统统抛在一边。艾伦太太生怕裁缝来晚了，她也顾不得安慰。甚至连自己已经跟人约好晚上去跳舞这等荣幸事。也只能在一小时里抽出一分钟来回味一番。</p>
