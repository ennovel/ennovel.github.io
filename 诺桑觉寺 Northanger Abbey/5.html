Mr. Tilney was no fonder of the play than the pump-room. She hoped to be more fortunate the next day; and when her wishes for fine weather were answered by seeing a beautiful morning, she hardly felt a doubt of it; for a fine Sunday in Bath empties every house of its inhabitants, and all the world appears on such an occasion to walk about and tell their acquaintance what a charming day it is.</p> 
<p>As soon as divine service was over, the Thorpes and Allens eagerly joined each other; and after staying long enough in the pump-room to discover that the crowd was insupportable, and that there was not a genteel face to be seen, which everybody discovers every Sunday throughout the season, they hastened away to the Crescent, to breathe the fresh air of better company. Here Catherine and Isabella, arm in arm, again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved conversation; they talked much, and with much enjoyment; but again was Catherine disappointed in her hope of reseeing her partner. He was nowhere to be met with; every search for him was equally unsuccessful, in morning lounges or evening assemblies; neither at the Upper nor Lower Rooms, at dressed or undressed balls, was he perceivable; nor among the walkers, the horsemen, or the curricle-drivers of the morning. His name was not in the pump-room book, and curiosity could do no more. He must be gone from Bath. Yet he had not mentioned that his stay would be so short! This sort of mysteriousness, which is always so becoming in a hero, threw a fresh grace in Catherine's imagination around his person and manners, and increased her anxiety to know more of him. From the Thorpes she could learn nothing, for they had been only two days in Bath before they met with Mrs. Allen. It was a subject, however, in which she often indulged with her fair friend, from whom she received every possible encouragement to continue to think of him; and his impression on her fancy was not suffered therefore to weaken. Isabella was very sure that he must be a charming young man, and was equally sure that he must have been delighted with her dear Catherine, and would therefore shortly return. She liked him the better for being a clergyman, "for she must confess herself very partial to the profession"; and something like a sigh escaped her as she said it. Perhaps Catherine was wrong in not demanding the cause of that gentle emotion -- but she was not experienced enough in the finesse of love, or the duties of friendship, to know when delicate raillery was properly called for, or when a confidence should be forced.</p> 
<p>Mrs. Allen was now quite happy -- quite satisfied with Bath. She had found some acquaintance, had been so lucky too as to find in them the family of a most worthy old friend; and, as the completion of good fortune, had found these friends by no means so expensively dressed as herself. Her daily expressions were no longer, "I wish we had some acquaintance in Bath!" They were changed into, "How glad I am we have met with Mrs. Thorpe!" and she was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two families, as her young charge and Isabella themselves could be; never satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of Mrs. Thorpe, in what they called conversation, but in which there was scarcely ever any exchange of opinion, and not often any resemblance of subject, for Mrs. Thorpe talked chiefly of her children, and Mrs. Allen of her gowns.</p> 
<p>The progress of the friendship between Catherine and Isabella was quick as its beginning had been warm, and they passed so rapidly through every gradation of increasing tenderness that there was shortly no fresh proof of it to be given to their friends or themselves. They called each other by their Christian name, were always arm in arm when they walked, pinned up each other's train for the dance, and were not to be divided in the set; and if a rainy morning deprived them of other enjoyments, they were still resolute in meeting in defiance of wet and dirt, and shut themselves up, to read novels together. Yes, novels; for I will not adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel-writers, of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances, to the number of which they are themselves adding -- joining with their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works, and scarcely ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine, who, if she accidentally take up a novel, is sure to turn over its insipid pages with disgust. Alas! If the heroine of one novel be not patronized by the heroine of another, from whom can she expect protection and regard? I cannot approve of it. Let us leave it to the reviewers to abuse such effusions of fancy at their leisure, and over every new novel to talk in threadbare strains of the trash with which the press now groans. Let us not desert one another; we are an injured body. Although our productions have afforded more extensive and unaffected pleasure than those of any other literary corporation in the world, no species of composition has been so much decried. From pride, ignorance, or fashion, our foes are almost as many as our readers. And while the abilities of the nine-hundredth abridger of the History of England, or of the man who collects and publishes in a volume some dozen lines of Milton, Pope, and Prior, with a paper from the Spectator, and a chapter from Sterne, are eulogized by a thousand pens -- there seems almost a general wish of decrying the capacity and undervaluing the labour of the novelist, and of slighting the performances which have only genius, wit, and taste to recommend them. "I am no novel-reader -- I seldom look into novels -- Do not imagine that I often read novels -- It is really very well for a novel." Such is the common cant. "And what are you reading, Miss -- ?" "Oh! It is only a novel!" replies the young lady, while she lays down her book with affected indifference, or momentary shame. "It is only Cecilia, or Camilla, or Belinda"; or, in short, only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed to the world in the best-chosen language. Now, had the same young lady been engaged with a volume of the Spectator, instead of such a work, how proudly would she have produced the book, and told its name; though the chances must be against her being occupied by any part of that voluminous publication, of which either the matter or manner would not disgust a young person of taste: the substance of its papers so often consisting in the statement of improbable circumstances, unnatural characters, and topics of conversation which no longer concern anyone living; and their language, too, frequently so coarse as to give no very favourable idea of the age that could endure it.</p> 
<p>当天晚上，凯瑟琳坐在剧院里，见索普小姐频频向她点头、微笑，当然要花出很多工夫进行回敬。但她没有顾此失彼，没有忘记左顾右盼，往她目力所及的每个包厢里寻觅蒂尔尼先生。可惜她始终也没找到。蒂尔尼先生看戏的兴趣，并不比去矿泉厅的兴趣大。莫兰小馆希望第二天能走运一些。当她祈求天公作美的愿望得到应验，次日早晨果见天晴气朗时，她简直不怀疑自己要交好运了，因为在巴思，星期天天气一好，家家户户都要出来玩耍。这时候，仿佛全镇的人都在到处散步，见熟人便说：今天天气多好。</p> 
<p>一作完礼拜，索普一家和艾伦夫妇便急忙跑到了一起。大家先到矿泉厅玩了了一会，发现那里面人太多，而且见不到一副优雅的面孔。在这个季节，每逢星期天，都有这个感觉,便又匆匆赶到新月街，去呼吸一下上流社会的新鲜空气。在这里，凯瑟琳和伊莎贝拉臂挽着臂，无拘无束地畅谈着，再次尝到了友谊的欢乐。她们谈了很多，而且也很带劲，但是凯瑟琳重见她的舞伴的希望又落空了。蒂尔尼先生哪儿也碰不见。早晨的散步也好，晚上的舞会也罢，总是找不到他。无论在上舞厅还是下舞厅，无论在化装舞会上还是便装舞会上，哪儿都见不到他，在早晨散步、骑马或赶车的人们中间，也找不见他。矿泉厅的来宾簿上没有他的名字，再怎么打听也无济于事。他一定离开巴思了，然而他并没说过只呆这么几天呀。男主角总是行踪神秘，在凯瑟琳的想象中，这种神秘感给蒂尔尼的容貌和举止增添了一层新的魅力，使她更迫切地要进一步了解他。她从索普家那儿探听不到什么情况，因为她们遇见艾伦太太之前，来到巴思仅仅两天。不过，这是她和她的漂亮朋友经常议论的话题。她的朋友极力鼓励她，要她不要忘掉蒂尔尼先生。因此，蒂尔尼先生给她留下的印象一直没有减淡。伊莎贝拉确信，蒂尔尼先生一定是个很迷人的青年。她还确信，他一定很喜欢亲爱的凯瑟琳，因此很快就会回来的。她还因为他是个牧师，而越发喜爱他，因为“说老实话，我自己就很喜欢这个职业”。伊莎贝拉说完这话，不由自主地像是叹了口气。也许凯瑟琳不该不问问她为何轻声叹息，但她对爱情的花招和友谊的职责毕竟不够老练，不知道什么时候需要插科打诨，什么时候应该迫使对方吐露隐衷。</p> 
<p>艾伦太太现在十分快活，对巴思十分满意。她终于找到了熟人，还非常幸运地发现，她们原来是她的一位极其可敬的老朋友的一家人。而且，使她感到无比庆幸的是，这些朋友的穿戴绝没有她自己的来得豪华。她每天的口头禅不再是：“我们要是在巴思有几位朋友就好了，”而是变成：“我真高兴，能遇见索普太太！”她就像她年轻的被保护人和伊莎贝拉一样，迫不及待地要增进两家人的交往。一天下来，除非大部分时间是守在索普太太身边，否则她决不会感到满意。她们在一起，照她们的说法是聊聊天，谁知她们几乎从不交换意见，也很少谈论类似的话题，因为索普太太主要谈自己的孩子，艾伦太太主要谈自己的长裙。</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳与伊莎贝拉之间的友谊，一开始就很热烈，因而进展得也很迅速。两人一步步地越来越亲密，不久，无论她们的朋友还是她们自己，再也见不到还有什么进一步发展的余地了。她们相互以教名相称，总是挽臂而行。跳舞时相互帮着别好长裙，并且非在一个组里跳不可。如果逢上早晨下雨，不能享受别的乐趣，那她们也要不顾雨水与泥泞，坚决聚到一起，关在屋里一道看小说。是的，看小说，因为我不想采取小说家通常采取的那种卑鄙而愚蠢的行径，明明自己也在写小说，却以轻蔑的态度去诋毁小说。他们同自己不共戴天的敌人串通一气，对这些作品进行恶语中伤，从不允许自己作品中的女主角看小说。如果有位女主角偶尔拾起了一本书，这本书一定乏味至极，女主角一定怀着憎恶的心情在翻阅着。天哪！如果一部小说的女主角不从另一部小说的女主角那里得到庇护，那她又能指望从何处得到保护和尊重呢？我可不赞成这样做。让那些评论家穷极无聊地去咒骂那些洋溢着丰富想象力的作品吧，让他们使用那些目今充斥在报章上的种种陈词滥调去谈论每本新小说吧。我们可不要互相背弃，我们是个受到残害的整体。虽然我们的作品比其他任何文学形式给人们提供了更广泛、更真挚的乐趣，但是还没有任何一种作品遭到如此多的诋毁。由于傲慢、无知或赶时髦的缘故，我们的敌人几乎和我们的读者一样多。有人把《英国史》缩写成百分之九，有人把弥尔顿、蒲柏和普赖尔的几十行诗，《旁观者》的一篇杂文，以及斯特恩作品里的某一章，拼凑成一个集子加以出版，诸如此般的才干受到了上千人的赞颂；然而人们几乎总是愿意诋毁小说家的才能，贬损小说家的劳动，蔑视那些只以天才、智慧和情趣见长的作品。“我不是小说读者，很少浏览小说。别以为我常看小说。这对一本小说来说还真够不错的了。”这是人们常用的口头禅。</p> 
<p>“你在读什么,小姐! ”“哦!</p> 
<p>只不过是本小说！小姐答道，一面装着不感兴趣的样子，或是露出一时羞愧难言的神情，赶忙将书撂下。“这只不过是本《西西丽亚》，《卡米拉》，或是《贝林达》。总而言之，只是这样一些作品。在这些作品中，智慧的伟力得到了最充分的施展，因而，对人性的最透彻的理解、对其千姿百态的恰如其分的描述，四处洋溢的机智幽默，所有这一切都用最精湛的语言展现出来。假如那位小姐是在看一本《旁观者》杂志。而不是在看这种作品，她一定会十分骄傲地把杂志拿出来，而且说出它的名字！不过，别看那厚厚的一本，这位小姐无论在读哪一篇，其内容和文体都不可能不使一位情趣高雅的青年人为之作呕。这些作品的要害，往在在于描写了一些不可能发生的事件，矫揉造作的人物，以及与活人无关的话题；而且语言常常如此粗劣，使人对于能够容忍这种语言的时代产生了不良的印象。</p>
