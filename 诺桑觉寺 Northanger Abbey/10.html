"Oh, heavens! My beloved Catherine, have I got you at last?" was her address on Catherine's entering the box and sitting by her. "Now, Mr. Morland," for he was close to her on the other side, "I shall not speak another word to you all the rest of the evening; so I charge you not to expect it. My sweetest Catherine, how have you been this long age? But I need not ask you, for you look delightfully. You really have done your hair in a more heavenly style than ever; you mischievous creature, do you want to attract everybody? I assure you, my brother is quite in love with you already; and as for Mr. Tilney -- but that is a settled thing -- even your modesty cannot doubt his attachment now; his coming back to Bath makes it too plain. Oh! What would not I give to see him! I really am quite wild with impatience. My mother says he is the most delightful young man in the world; she saw him this morning, you know; you must introduce him to me. Is he in the house now? Look about, for heaven's sake! I assure you, I can hardly exist till I see him."</p> 
<p>"No," said Catherine, "he is not here; I cannot see him anywhere."</p> 
<p>"Oh, horrid! Am I never to be acquainted with him? How do you like my gown? I think it does not look amiss; the sleeves were entirely my own thought. Do you know, I get so immoderately sick of Bath; your brother and I were agreeing this morning that, though it is vastly well to be here for a few weeks, we would not live here for millions. We soon found out that our tastes were exactly alike in preferring the country to every other place; really, our opinions were so exactly the same, it was quite ridiculous! There was not a single point in which we differed; I would not have had you by for the world; you are such a sly thing, I am sure you would have made some droll remark or other about it."</p> 
<p>"No, indeed I should not."</p> 
<p>"Oh, yes you would indeed; I know you better than you know yourself. You would have told us that we seemed born for each other, or some nonsense of that kind, which would have distressed me beyond conception; my cheeks would have been as red as your roses; I would not have had you by for the world."</p> 
<p>"Indeed you do me injustice; I would not have made so improper a remark upon any account; and besides, I am sure it would never have entered my head."</p> 
<p>Isabella smiled incredulously and talked the rest of the evening to James.</p> 
<p>Catherine's resolution of endeavouring to meet Miss Tilney again continued in full force the next morning; and till the usual moment of going to the pump-room, she felt some alarm from the dread of a second prevention. But nothing of that kind occurred, no visitors appeared to delay them, and they all three set off in good time for the pump-room, where the ordinary course of events and conversation took place; Mr. Allen, after drinking his glass of water, joined some gentlemen to talk over the politics of the day and compare the accounts of their newspapers; and the ladies walked about together, noticing every new face, and almost every new bonnet in the room. The female part of the Thorpe family, attended by James Morland, appeared among the crowd in less than a quarter of an hour, and Catherine immediately took her usual place by the side of her friend. James, who was now in constant attendance, maintained a similar position, and separating themselves from the rest of their party, they walked in that manner for some time, till Catherine began to doubt the happiness of a situation which, confining her entirely to her friend and brother, gave her very little share in the notice of either. They were always engaged in some sentimental discussion or lively dispute, but their sentiment was conveyed in such whispering voices, and their vivacity attended with so much laughter, that though Catherine's supporting opinion was not unfrequently called for by one or the other, she was never able to give any, from not having heard a word of the subject. At length however she was empowered to disengage herself from her friend, by the avowed necessity of speaking to Miss Tilney, whom she most joyfully saw just entering the room with Mrs. Hughes, and whom she instantly joined, with a firmer determination to be acquainted, than she might have had courage to command, had she not been urged by the disappointment of the day before. Miss Tilney met her with great civility, returned her advances with equal goodwill, and they continued talking together as long as both parties remained in the room; and though in all probability not an observation was made, nor an expression used by either which had not been made and used some thousands of times before, under that roof, in every Bath season, yet the merit of their being spoken with simplicity and truth, and without personal conceit, might be something uncommon.</p> 
<p>"How well your brother dances!" was an artless exclamation of Catherine's towards the close of their conversation, which at once surprised and amused her companion.</p> 
<p>"Henry!" she replied with a smile. "Yes, he does dance very well."</p> 
<p>"He must have thought it very odd to hear me say I was engaged the other evening, when he saw me sitting down. But I really had been engaged the whole day to Mr. Thorpe." Miss Tilney could only bow. "You cannot think," added Catherine after a moment's silence, "how surprised I was to see him again. I felt so sure of his being quite gone away."</p> 
<p>"When Henry had the pleasure of seeing you before, he was in Bath but for a couple of days. He came only to engage lodgings for us."</p> 
<p>"That never occurred to me; and of course, not seeing him anywhere, I thought he must be gone. Was not the young lady he danced with on Monday a Miss Smith?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, an acquaintance of Mrs. Hughes."</p> 
<p>"I dare say she was very glad to dance. Do you think her pretty?"</p> 
<p>"Not very."</p> 
<p>"He never comes to the pump-room, I suppose?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, sometimes; but he has rid out this morning with my father."</p> 
<p>Mrs. Hughes now joined them, and asked Miss Tilney if she was ready to go. "I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing you again soon," said Catherine. "Shall you be at the cotillion ball tomorrow?"</p> 
<p>"Perhaps we -- Yes, I think we certainly shall."</p> 
<p>"I am glad of it, for we shall all be there." This civility was duly returned; and they parted -- on Miss Tilney's side with some knowledge of her new acquaintance's feelings, and on Catherine's, without the smallest consciousness of having explained them.</p> 
<p>She went home very happy. The morning had answered all her hopes, and the evening of the following day was now the object of expectation, the future good. What gown and what head-dress she should wear on the occasion became her chief concern. She cannot be justified in it. Dress is at all times a frivolous distinction, and excessive solicitude about it often destroys its own aim. Catherine knew all this very well; her great aunt had read her a lecture on the subject only the Christmas before; and yet she lay awake ten minutes on Wednesday night debating between her spotted and her tamboured muslin, and nothing but the shortness of the time prevented her buying a new one for the evening. This would have been an error in judgment, great though not uncommon, from which one of the other sex rather than her own, a brother rather than a great aunt, might have warned her, for man only can be aware of the insensibility of man towards a new gown. It would be mortifying to the feelings of many ladies, could they be made to understand how little the heart of man is affected by what is costly or new in their attire; how little it is biased by the texture of their muslin, and how unsusceptible of peculiar tenderness towards the spotted, the sprigged, the mull, or the jackonet. Woman is fine for her own satisfaction alone. No man will admire her the more, no woman will like her the better for it. Neatness and fashion are enough for the former, and a something of shabbiness or impropriety will be most endearing to the latter. But not one of these grave reflections troubled the tranquillity of Catherine.</p> 
<p>She entered the rooms on Thursday evening with feelings very different from what had attended her thither the Monday before. She had then been exulting in her engagement to Thorpe, and was now chiefly anxious to avoid his sight, lest he should engage her again; for though she could not, dared not expect that Mr. Tilney should ask her a third time to dance, her wishes, hopes, and plans all centred in nothing less. Every young lady may feel for my heroine in this critical moment, for every young lady has at some time or other known the same agitation. All have been, or at least all have believed themselves to be, in danger from the pursuit of someone whom they wished to avoid; and all have been anxious for the attentions of someone whom they wished to please. As soon as they were joined by the Thorpes, Catherine's agony began; she fidgeted about if John Thorpe came towards her, hid herself as much as possible from his view, and when he spoke to her pretended not to hear him. The cotillions were over, the country-dancing beginning, and she saw nothing of the Tilneys.</p> 
<p>"Do not be frightened, my dear Catherine," whispered Isabella, "but I am really going to dance with your brother again. I declare positively it is quite shocking. I tell him he ought to be ashamed of himself, but you and John must keep us in countenance. Make haste, my dear creature, and come to us. John is just walked off, but he will be back in a moment."</p> 
<p>Catherine had neither time nor inclination to answer. The others walked away, John Thorpe was still in view, and she gave herself up for lost. That she might not appear, however, to observe or expect him, she kept her eyes intently fixed on her fan; and a self-condemnation for her folly, in supposing that among such a crowd they should even meet with the Tilneys in any reasonable time, had just passed through her mind, when she suddenly found herself addressed and again solicited to dance, by Mr. Tilney himself. With what sparkling eyes and ready motion she granted his request, and with how pleasing a flutter of heart she went with him to the set, may be easily imagined. To escape, and, as she believed, so narrowly escape John Thorpe, and to be asked, so immediately on his joining her, asked by Mr. Tilney, as if he had sought her on purpose! -- it did not appear to her that life could supply any greater felicity.</p> 
<p>Scarcely had they worked themselves into the quiet possession of a place, however, when her attention was claimed by John Thorpe, who stood behind her. "Heyday, Miss Morland!" said he. "What is the meaning of this? I thought you and I were to dance together."</p> 
<p>"I wonder you should think so, for you never asked me."</p> 
<p>"That is a good one, by Jove! I asked you as soon as I came into the room, and I was just going to ask you again, but when I turned round, you were gone! This is a cursed shabby trick! I only came for the sake of dancing with you, and I firmly believe you were engaged to me ever since Monday. Yes; I remember, I asked you while you were waiting in the lobby for your cloak. And here have I been telling all my acquaintance that I was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room; and when they see you standing up with somebody else, they will quiz me famously."</p> 
<p>"Oh, no; they will never think of me, after such a description as that."</p> 
<p>"By heavens, if they do not, I will kick them out of the room for blockheads. What chap have you there?" Catherine satisfied his curiosity. "Tilney," he repeated. "Hum -- I do not know him. A good figure of a man; well put together. Does he want a horse? Here is a friend of mine, Sam Fletcher, has got one to sell that would suit anybody. A famous clever animal for the road -- only forty guineas. I had fifty minds to buy it myself, for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse when I meet with one; but it would not answer my purpose, it would not do for the field. I would give any money for a real good hunter. I have three now, the best that ever were backed. I would not take eight hundred guineas for them. Fletcher and I mean to get a house in Leicestershire, against the next season. It is so d -- uncomfortable, living at an inn."</p> 
<p>This was the last sentence by which he could weary Catherine's attention, for he was just then borne off by the resistless pressure of a long string of passing ladies. Her partner now drew near, and said, "That gentleman would have put me out of patience, had he stayed with you half a minute longer. He has no business to withdraw the attention of my partner from me. We have entered into a contract of mutual agreeableness for the space of an evening, and all our agreeableness belongs solely to each other for that time. Nobody can fasten themselves on the notice of one, without injuring the rights of the other. I consider a country-dance as an emblem of marriage. Fidelity and complaisance are the principal duties of both; and those men who do not choose to dance or marry themselves, have no business with the partners or wives of their neighbours."</p> 
<p>"But they are such very different things!"</p> 
<p>" -- That you think they cannot be compared together."</p> 
<p>"To be sure not. People that marry can never part, but must go and keep house together. People that dance only stand opposite each other in a long room for half an hour."</p> 
<p>"And such is your definition of matrimony and dancing. Taken in that light certainly, their resemblance is not striking; but I think I could place them in such a view. You will allow, that in both, man has the advantage of choice, woman only the power of refusal; that in both, it is an engagement between man and woman, formed for the advantage of each; and that when once entered into, they belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution; that it is their duty, each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere, and their best interest to keep their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours, or fancying that they should have been better off with anyone else. You will allow all this?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, to be sure, as you state it, all this sounds very well; but still they are so very different. I cannot look upon them at all in the same light, nor think the same duties belong to them."</p> 
<p>"In one respect, there certainly is a difference. In marriage, the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman, the woman to make the home agreeable to the man; he is to purvey, and she is to smile. But in dancing, their duties are exactly changed; the agreeableness, the compliance are expected from him, while she furnishes the fan and the lavender water. That, I suppose, was the difference of duties which struck you, as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison."</p> 
<p>"No, indeed, I never thought of that."</p> 
<p>"Then I am quite at a loss. One thing, however, I must observe. This disposition on your side is rather alarming. You totally disallow any similarity in the obligations; and may I not thence infer that your notions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as your partner might wish? Have I not reason to fear that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to return, or if any other gentleman were to address you, there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with him as long as you chose?"</p> 
<p>"Mr. Thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother's, that if he talks to me, I must talk to him again; but there are hardly three young men in the room besides him that I have any acquaintance with."</p> 
<p>"And is that to be my only security? Alas, alas!"</p> 
<p>"Nay, I am sure you cannot have a better; for if I do not know anybody, it is impossible for me to talk to them; and, besides, I do not want to talk to anybody."</p> 
<p>"Now you have given me a security worth having; and I shall proceed with courage. Do you find Bath as agreeable as when I had the honour of making the inquiry before?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, quite -- more so, indeed."</p> 
<p>"More so! Take care, or you will forget to be tired of it at the proper time. You ought to be tired at the end of six weeks."</p> 
<p>"I do not think I should be tired, if I were to stay here six months."</p> 
<p>"Bath, compared with London, has little variety, and so everybody finds out every year. 'For six weeks, I allow Bath is pleasant enough; but beyond that, it is the most tiresome place in the world.' You would be told so by people of all descriptions, who come regularly every winter, lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve, and go away at last because they can afford to stay no longer."</p> 
<p>"Well, other people must judge for themselves, and those who go to London may think nothing of Bath. But I, who live in a small retired village in the country, can never find greater sameness in such a place as this than in my own home; for here are a variety of amusements, a variety of things to be seen and done all day long, which I can know nothing of there."</p> 
<p>"You are not fond of the country."</p> 
<p>"Yes, I am. I have always lived there, and always been very happy. But certainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a Bath life. One day in the country is exactly like another."</p> 
<p>"But then you spend your time so much more rationally in the country."</p> 
<p>"Do I?"</p> 
<p>"Do you not?"</p> 
<p>"I do not believe there is much difference."</p> 
<p>"Here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long."</p> 
<p>"And so I am at home -- only I do not find so much of it. I walk about here, and so I do there; but here I see a variety of people in every street, and there I can only go and call on Mrs. Allen."</p> 
<p>Mr. Tilney was very much amused.</p> 
<p>"Only go and call on Mrs. Allen!" he repeated. "What a picture of intellectual poverty! However, when you sink into this abyss again, you will have more to say. You will be able to talk of Bath, and of all that you did here."</p> 
<p>"Oh! Yes. I shall never be in want of something to talk of again to Mrs. Allen, or anybody else. I really believe I shall always be talking of Bath, when I am at home again -- I do like it so very much. If I could but have Papa and Mamma, and the rest of them here, I suppose I should be too happy! James's coming (my eldest brother) is quite delightful -- and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are his intimate friends already. Oh! Who can ever be tired of Bath?"</p> 
<p>"Not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do. But papas and mammas, and brothers, and intimate friends are a good deal gone by, to most of the frequenters of Bath -- and the honest relish of balls and plays, and everyday sights, is past with them." Here their conversation closed, the demands of the dance becoming now too importunate for a divided attention.</p> 
<p>Soon after their reaching the bottom of the set, Catherine perceived herself to be earnestly regarded by a gentleman who stood among the lookers-on, immediately behind her partner. He was a very handsome man, of a commanding aspect, past the bloom, but not past the vigour of life; and with his eye still directed towards her, she saw him presently address Mr. Tilney in a familiar whisper. Confused by his notice, and blushing from the fear of its being excited by something wrong in her appearance, she turned away her head. But while she did so, the gentleman retreated, and her partner, coming nearer, said, "I see that you guess what I have just been asked. That gentleman knows your name, and you have a right to know his. It is General Tilney, my father."</p> 
<p>Catherine's answer was only "Oh!" -- but it was an "Oh!" expressing everything needful: attention to his words, and perfect reliance on their truth. With real interest and strong admiration did her eye now follow the general, as he moved through the crowd, and "How handsome a family they are!" was her secret remark.</p> 
<p>In chatting with Miss Tilney before the evening concluded, a new source of felicity arose to her. She had never taken a country walk since her arrival in Bath. Miss Tilney, to whom all the commonly frequented environs were familiar, spoke of them in terms which made her all eagerness to know them too; and on her openly fearing that she might find nobody to go with her, it was proposed by the brother and sister that they should join in a walk, some morning or other. "I shall like it," she cried, "beyond anything in the world; and do not let us put it off -- let us go tomorrow." This was readily agreed to, with only a proviso of Miss Tilney's, that it did not rain, which Catherine was sure it would not. At twelve o'clock, they were to call for her in Pulteney Street; and "Remember -- twelve o'clock," was her parting speech to her new friend. Of her other, her older, her more established friend, Isabella, of whose fidelity and worth she had enjoyed a fortnight's experience, she scarcely saw anything during the evening. Yet, though longing to make her acquainted with her happiness, she cheerfully submitted to the wish of Mr. Allen, which took them rather early away, and her spirits danced within her, as she danced in her chair all the way home.</p> 
<p>晚上，艾伦夫妇，索普太太一家，莫兰兄妹都来到剧院。伊莎贝拉同凯瑟琳坐在一起，她在她们漫长的分离中攒下的一肚子话，现在总算有机会吐露几句了。“哦、天哪！亲爱的凯瑟琳，我们总算又到一块了！”凯瑟琳一走进包厢，坐到她身边，她便这样说道，“你听着，莫兰先生，”因为詹姆斯坐在她另一侧，“这整个晚上我不再跟你说一句话了，所以我奉劝你别再指望了。亲爱的凯瑟琳，你这一向可好吗？不过我用不着问你，因为你看上去很高兴。你的发式比以前更漂亮了。你这个调皮鬼，你想把每一个人都迷住吗？老实告诉你，我哥哥已经深深爱上你了。至于蒂尔尼先生——不过那已经是大局已定了——即使像你这么谦虚的人，也不能怀疑他对你一片钟情。他回到巴思这件事，使问题再清楚不过了。噢！我说什么也要见见他！我真等得不耐烦了。我母亲说，他是天下最可爱的小伙子。你知道吧，我母亲今天上午见到他了。你一定要给我介绍介绍。他这会儿在不在剧院里？看在老天爷的份上，请你四下瞧瞧！说老实话，我不见到他简直没法活了。”</p> 
<p>“不在，”凯瑟琳说，“他不在这里。我哪儿也看不见他。”</p> 
<p>“哦，可怕！难道我永远也不能和他结识？你觉得我这件长裙怎么样？我想看不出什么毛病吧？这袖子完全是我自己设计的。你知道吧，我对巴思腻味透了！你哥哥和我今天早晨都这么说，在这里玩几周虽说满不错，但是说什么也不要住在这里。我俩很快发现，我们的爱好完全一样，都爱乡下不爱别的地方。的确，我们的意见完全一致，真是滑稽。我们的意见没有一丁点不同的地方。我可不希望你当时在旁边，你这个狡猾的东西，我知道你准会说些离奇的话。”</p> 
<p>“不，我真不会。”</p> 
<p>“哦，你会的！你准会说。我比你本人还了解你。你会说，我们是天造地设的一对儿，或者诸如此类的胡话，羞得我无地自容，我的脸就像你的玫瑰花一样红。我决不希望你当时在旁边。”</p> 
<p>“你真是冤枉我了。我无论如何也说不出那样没体统的话，何况……我压根儿想不到这种话。”</p> 
<p>伊莎贝拉怀疑地笑了笑，晚上余下的时间就一直在同詹姆斯说话。</p> 
<p>第二天上午，凯瑟琳仍然一心一意地想要再次见到蒂尔尼小姐。在去矿泉厅的通常时刻到来之前，她不觉有些惶惶不安，唯恐再遇到什么阻碍。但是这种情况并未发生，没有客人来耽搁他们。三个人准时出发，来到矿泉厅，像往常一样，仍然去做那些事，说那些话。艾伦先生饮过矿泉水后，便同几位先生一起谈起了当天的政事，比较一下各人在报上看到的各种说法。两位女士在一道转悠，注视着每一张陌生的面孔，几乎每一顶新女帽。索普太太母女由詹姆斯·莫兰陪同，不到一刻钟便出现在人群里，凯瑟琳马上像通常一样，来到她朋友身边。詹姆斯现在是紧随不舍，也来到了她身边。他们撇开了别的人，按这种阵势走了一会。后来，凯瑟琳对这种处境的乐趣产生了怀疑，因为她虽说只和她的朋友和哥哥在一起，他们却很少注意她。他们俩总在热情地讨论什么，或是激烈地争论什么，但是他们的感情是用悄声细语来传达的，争得激烈的时候又常常哈哈大笑，他们虽则经常或你或我地请求凯瑟琳发表支持意见，但是凯瑟琳因为一个字儿也没听清他们的话，总是发表不出任何意见。最后，她终于找到了一个离开她朋友的机会。看见蒂尔尼小姐同休斯太太走进屋来，她心里高兴极了，便说有话要同蒂尔尼小姐说，于是便立刻跑了过去，决计阿蒂尔尼小姐交上朋友。其实，她若不是受到头天失望情绪的激励，兴许还鼓不起那么大的勇气！蒂尔尼小姐十分客气地招呼她，以同样友好的态度报答她的友好表示，两人一直说到她们的伙伴要离开时为止。虽然她们说的每句话，用的每个字眼，很可能来巴思的每个旺季，在这间大厅里，不知道被人们用过几千次，然而这些语说得如此真挚朴实，毫无虚荣浮夸之感，这却有点难能可贵。</p> 
<p>“你哥哥的舞跳得真好！”她们的谈话快结束时，凯瑟琳天真地说道。她的伙伴，不觉又惊又喜。</p> 
<p>“亨利！”她笑吟吟地答道，“是的，他的舞跳得的确好。”</p> 
<p>“那天晚上他见我坐着不动，可又听我说我已约好了舞伴，一定感到很奇怪。可我真的全天都同索普先生约好了。”蒂尔尼小姐只能点点头。“你无法想象，”沉默了一会之后，凯瑟琳接着说道，“我再见到他时有多惊讶。我还真以为他远走高飞了呢。”</p> 
<p>“亨利上次有幸见到你时，他在巴思仅仅逗留了两天。他是来给我们订房子的。”</p> 
<p>“这我可从没想到。当然，到处见不到他，我以为他准是走了。星期一和他跳舞的那位年轻女士是不是一位史密斯小姐？”</p> 
<p>“是的。休斯太太的一位朋友。”</p> 
<p>“她大概很喜欢跳舞。你觉得她漂亮吗？”</p> 
<p>“不很漂亮。”</p> 
<p>“我想，你哥哥从不来矿泉厅吧？”</p> 
<p>“不，有时候来。不过他今天早晨跟我父亲骑马出去了。”</p> 
<p>这时休斯太太走过来，问蒂尔尼小姐想不想走。“希望不久有幸再见到你，”凯瑟琳说，“你参加，明天的克提林舞会吗？”</p> 
<p>“也许——是的，我想我们一定会去。”</p> 
<p>“那好极了，我们都去那儿。”对方照样客气了一声，随后两人便分手了。这时，蒂尔尼小姐对这个新朋友的心思多少有了些了解。但是凯瑟琳一点也没意识到，那是她自己流露出来的。</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳高高兴兴地回到家。今天上午她总算如愿以偿了，现在她的期待目标是明天晚上，是未来的快乐。到时候她该穿什么长裙，戴什么首饰，成了她最关心的事情。照理她不该这么讲究穿戴。无论什么时候，衣服都是徒有虚表的东西，过分考究往往会使它失去原有的作用。凯瑟琳很清楚这一点。就在去年圣诞节，她的姑婆还教导过她。然而，她星期三夜里躺下十分钟之久还没睡着，盘算着究竟是穿那件带斑点的纱裙，还是穿件绣花的纱裙。要不是因为时间仓促，她准要买一件新衣服晚上穿。她若是真买了，那将是一个很大的（虽然并非罕见的）失算，而对于这种失算，若是换个男人而不是女人，换个哥哥而不是姑婆，或许是会告诫她的，因为只有男人知道男人对新衣服是满不在乎的。有许多女人，假使她们能够懂得男人对于她们穿着华丽或是时新多么无动于衷，对于细纱布的质地好坏多么无所谓，对于她们偏爱带斑点的、有枝叶花纹的、透明的细纱布或薄棉布多么缺乏敏感，那她们将会感到很伤心。女人穿戴考究只能使她自已感到满足。男人不会因此而更倾慕她，别的女人不会因此而更喜爱她。“男人觉得，女人整洁入时已经足够了；而对于女人来说，穿着有点寒酸失体的女人将最为可爱，但是，这些严肃的思想并没扰乱凯瑟琳内心的平静。</p> 
<p>星期四晚上她走进舞厅，心情与星期一来这里时大不相同。当时她为自己约好同索普跳舞而感到欢欣鼓舞，现在她主要担忧的却是千万不要见到他，免得他再来约她跳舞。她虽则不能也不敢指望蒂尔尼先生会第三次请她跳舞，但是她的心愿、她的希望、她的打算却全都集注在这上面。在这个节骨眼上，每个年轻小姐都会同情我的女主角的，因为每个年轻小姐都曾经体验过同样的激动不安。她们全都被自己怕见的人追逐过，或者至少也自以为经历过这种危险；并且她们全都渴望过要博得自己心上人对自己的青睐。索普家的人一来到她们中间，凯瑟琳的苦恼便开始了。要是约翰·索普朝她走来，她便感到坐立不安，尽量避开他的视线；当他跟她搭话时，她就硬是装作没有听见。克提林舞结束了，接着开始了乡风舞，可她还是见不到蒂尔尼兄妹的影子。“你可不要吃惊．亲爱的凯瑟琳，”伊莎贝拉消声说道，“我又要和你哥哥跳舞了。我的确认为这太不像话。我跟他说，他应该为自己感到害臊，不过你和约翰可得给我们捧捧场。快，亲爱的凯瑟琳，到我们这儿来。约翰刚刚走开，一会儿就回来。”</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳没来得及回答，不过她也不想回答。那两人走开了，约翰·索普还在附近，她觉得一切都完了。不过，为了使自己显得不在注意他，不在期待他、她只管拿眼睛死盯着自己的扇子。人这么多，她居然认为可以在短时间内遇见蒂尔尼兄妹！她刚想责怪自己太傻，猛然发现蒂尔尼先生在跟她说话，再次请她跳舞。她接受他的邀请时眼睛如何烁烁发光，动作如何爽快，同他走向舞池时心房跳得如何惬意，这都不难想象！逃脱了约翰·索普，而</p> 
<p>且她认为逃脱得很悬乎，接着遇到蒂尔尼先生，马上受到他的邀请，好像他在有意寻她似的！在凯瑟琳看来，这真是人生的最大幸福。</p> 
<p>谁料想，他俩刚挤进去，悄悄地占了一个位置，凯瑟琳便发现约翰·索普在背后招她。“嗨，莫兰小姐！”他说，“你这是什么意思？我还以为你要和我一起跳呢。”</p> 
<p>“我很奇怪你会这样想，因为你根本没有请过我。”</p> 
<p>“啊，这是什么话！我一进屋就请过你，刚才正要再去请你，不想一转身、你就溜了！这种伎俩真卑鄙！我是特意为了跟你跳舞才来这儿的，我坚信你从星期一起就一直约好同我跳舞的。对，我想起来了，你在休息室等着取斗篷的时候，我向你提出了邀请。我刚才还对这屋里所有的熟人说，我要和舞会上最漂亮的姑娘跳舞。他们要是见你在和别人跳舞，准会老实不客气地挖苦我。”</p> 
<p>“哦！不会的。经你那么一形容，他们决不会想到是我。”</p> 
<p>“我敢起誓！他们要是想不到是你，我就把他们当成傻瓜踢出大厅。那家伙是什么人？”凯瑟琳满足了他的好奇心。“蒂尔尼，”索普重复了一声，“哼，我不认识他。身材倒不错，长得挺匀称的。他要不要买马？我这儿有位朋友，萨姆·弗莱彻。他有匹马要卖，对谁都合适。跑起路来快极了，才要四十凡尼。我本来一百个想买它，因为我有句格言：见到好马非买不可。可惜这马不合我的要求，不能打猎。要是匹货真价实的好猎马，出多少钱我都干。我现在有三匹，都是最好骑的马。就是给我八百几尼，我也不卖。弗莱彻和我打算在莱斯特郡买座房子，准备下个猎季用。住在旅馆里太他妈的不舒服了。”</p> 
<p>这是他所能烦扰凯瑟琳的最后一句话，原来恰在此刻，一大帮女士一拥而过，不可抗拒地把他挤走了。这时，凯瑟琳的舞伴走上前来，说道：“那位先生再多纠缠半分钟，我就会忍耐不住了。他没有权利转移我的舞伴的注意力。我们已经订了约，今天晚上要互相使对方愉快，在此期间，我们的愉快只能由我们两个人来分享。谁要是缠住了其中一个人，不可能不损害另一个人的权利。我把乡风舞视为婚姻的象征。忠诚和顺从是双方的主要职责。那些自己不想跳舞，不想结婚的男人，休要纠缠他们邻人的舞伴或妻子。”</p> 
<p>“不过，那是截然不同的两码事。”</p> 
<p>“你认为不能相提并论？”</p> 
<p>“当然不能。结了婚的人水远不能分离、而必须一同生活，一同理家。跳舞的人只是在一间长房子里面对面地站上半个钟头。”</p> 
<p>“你原来是这样给结婚和跳舞下定义的。照这样看来它们当然就不很相似了。不过，我想我可以用另外一种观点来看待它们。你会承认，两者都是男人享有选择的便利，而女人只有拒绝的权利。两者都是男女之间的协定，对双方都有好处。一旦达成协定，他们只归相互所有，值至解除协定为止。他们各自都有个义务，不能提出理由后悔自己为什么没有选择别人，最有利的作法是不要对自己邻人的才艺作非分之想，或者幻想自己找到别人会更加幸福。你承认这一切吗？”</p> 
<p>“当然承认。如你所说的，这一切听上去都不错。但它们还是截然不同的。我怎么也不能把它们等量齐观起来，也不能认为它们赋有同样的义务。”</p> 
<p>“在某一点上、差别当然是有的。结了婚，男人必须赡养女人，女人必须给男人安排个温暖的家庭。一个是供养家庭，一个是笑脸相迎。，但在跳舞时、两人的职责恰好调了个儿：男的要做到谦和顺从，女的要提供扇子和薰衣草香水。我想，这就是被你认为造成两者无法相比的职责差别吧。”</p> 
<p>“不对，的确不对。我从没想到那上面。”</p> 
<p>“那我就大惑不解了。不过，有一点我必须指出。你的脾气真令人惊讶。你完全否认它们在义务上有任何相似的地方。因此我是否可以推断：你对跳舞职责的看法并不像你的舞伴所希望的那样严格？难道我没有理由担忧：假如刚才同你说话的那个男人再回来，或者别的男人要找你说话，你会不受约束地同他爱讲多久就讲多久？”</p> 
<p>“索普先生是我哥哥的一个特别要好的朋友，他要是找我讲话，我还得同他讲。但是除他以外，我在这大厅里认识的年轻人还不到三个。”</p> 
<p>“难道这是我唯一的保险？天哪！天哪！”</p> 
<p>“唔，这可是你最好的保险啦。我要是谁也不认识，就不可能跟人说话。何况，我也不想同任何人说话。”</p> 
<p>“这回你可给了我个值得珍惜的保险。我可以大胆地继续下去了。你现在是不是还和上次我问你时一样喜欢巴思？”</p> 
<p>“是的，非常喜欢。甚至更喜欢了。”</p> 
<p>“更喜欢！你可要当心，不然你到时候会乐而忘返的。你呆上六个星期就该腻味了。”</p> 
<p>“我想，即使让我在这里呆上六个月，我也不会腻昧。”</p> 
<p>“和伦敦比起来，巴思十分单调，每年大家都有这个体会。‘我承认，只呆六个星期，巴思还是很有意思的。但是一超过这个期限，那它就是世界上最令人讨厌的地方了。’各种各样的人都会这样告诉你。可是他们每年冬天都要定期来到这里，把原定的六个星期延长到十个、十二个星期，最后因为没钱再住下去了。才都纷纷离去。</p> 
<p>“唔，各人有各人的看法，那些去伦敦的人尽可以瞧不起巴思。但是我生活在乡下一个偏僻的小村镇上，我决不会觉得像这样的地方会比我家乡还单调。这里一天到晚有各式各样的娱乐，还有各式各样的事情可看可做。这些，我在乡下是闻所未闻的。”</p> 
<p>“你不喜欢乡下啦。”</p> 
<p>“不，喜欢的。我一直住在乡下，也一直很快乐。但是，乡下的生活肯定比巴思的生活单调得多。在乡下，见天都是一模一样。”</p> 
<p>“可你在乡下生活得更有理智。”</p> 
<p>“是吗？”</p> 
<p>“难道不是？”</p> 
<p>“我认为没有多少区别。”</p> 
<p>“你在这里整天只是消遣娱乐呀。”</p> 
<p>“我在家里也一样，只是找不到那么多好玩的。我在这里到处溜达，在家里也是这样，不过我在这里的每条街上都见到形形色色的人们，在家里只能去看望艾伦太太。”</p> 
<p>蒂尔尼先生觉得很有趣。“只能去看望艾伦太太！”他重复了一声，“那可真无聊透了！不过、当你再度陷入这个深渊的时候，你就会有许多话好说了。你可以谈论巴思，谈论你在这里做的一切事情。”</p> 
<p>“哦，是的。我对艾伦先生或是别人决不会没话说了。我的确认为，我再回到家里可以一个劲儿地谈论巴思，我实在太喜欢巴思啦。我假使能让爸爸妈妈和家里的其他人都来这里，那该有多好啊！我大哥詹姆斯来了真叫人高兴。而尤其令人高兴的是：我们刚刚认识的那家人原来是他的老朋友，哦！谁还会厌烦巴思呢？”</p> 
<p>“像你这样看见什么都感到新奇的人，是不会厌烦巴思的。但是，对于大多数常来巴思的人来说，他们的爸爸妈妈和兄弟好友都早已来够了，他们对舞会、戏剧以及日常风景的真挚爱好，也已成为过去。”</p> 
<p>他们的谈话到此停止了。现在，跳舞已经到了不容分神的紧张阶段。</p> 
<p>两人刚刚跳到舞列的末尾，凯瑟琳察觉着热闹的人里有一位先生，就立在她舞伴的身后，正一本正经地审视着她。这是个十分漂亮的男子，仪表非常威严，虽然韶华已过，但是生命的活力犹在。他的目光仍然盯向凯瑟琳、凯瑟琳见他随即在亲呢地同蒂尔尼先生小声说话。她给看得有些心乱，唯恐自己外表有什么差失，引起了那人的注意，不觉绯红了脸。扭过头去。但是，就在她扭头的时候，那位先生走开了，她的舞伴却来到她跟前，说道：“我看得出来，你在猜测那位先生刚才问我什么话了。他知道你的名字，你也有权知道他的名字。他是蒂尔尼将军，我的父亲。”</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳只回答了一声、“哦！”但是这一声“哦”，却充分表达了所要表达的意思：听见了他的话，而且确信地讲的是实话。她带着真正的兴趣和强烈的敬慕之情，目送着将军在人群里穿过，心里暗暗赞叹一声：“多么漂亮的一家人啊！”</p> 
<p>夜晚来临，同蒂尔尼小姐闲谈时，她心头又泛起了一层新的喜悦。自到巴思以来，她还从未去乡下散过步。蒂尔尼小姐熟悉郊外人们常去游览的每个地方。说得凯瑟琳恨不得也去观光观光。</p> 
<p>当她表示恐怕没人陪她去时，那兄妹俩当下提议说，他们哪天上午陪她出去走走。“那好极了，”凯瑟琳嚷道，“咱们别拖了，明天就去吧。”兄妹俩欣然同意了，只是蒂尔尼小姐提了个条件：天不得下雨。凯瑟琳说，肯定不会下。他们约定，十二点来普尔蒂尼街喊她。“记住十二点，”临别时，凯瑟琳还对她的新朋友叮嘱了这么一句。至于她的老朋友伊莎贝拉，虽然和她结识得早一些，因而情谊也更深一些，通过两个星期的交往，对她的忠诚与美德已经有所体会，但她当晚几乎连个影子也没见到她。她虽说很想让伊莎贝拉知道自己有多么快乐，但还是欣然服从艾伦先生的意愿，早早离开了舞厅。回家的路上，她坐在轿子里，身子在摇颤，心花在怒放。</p>
