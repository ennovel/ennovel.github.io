Her situation in life, the character of her father and mother, her own person and disposition, were all equally against her. Her father was a clergyman, without being neglected, or poor, and a very respectable man, though his name was Richard -- and he had never been handsome. He had a considerable independence besides two good livings -- and he was not in the least addicted to locking up his daughters. Her mother was a woman of useful plain sense, with a good temper, and, what is more remarkable, with a good constitution. She had three sons before Catherine was born; and instead of dying in bringing the latter into the world, as anybody might expect, she still lived on -- lived to have six children more -- to see them growing up around her, and to enjoy excellent health herself. A family of ten children will be always called a fine family, where there are heads and arms and legs enough for the number; but the Morlands had little other right to the word, for they were in general very plain, and Catherine, for many years of her life, as plain as any. She had a thin awkward figure, a sallow skin without colour, dark lank hair, and strong features -- so much for her person; and not less unpropitious for heroism seemed her mind. She was fond of all boy's plays, and greatly preferred cricket not merely to dolls, but to the more heroic enjoyments of infancy, nursing a dormouse, feeding a canary-bird, or watering a rose-bush. Indeed she had no taste for a garden; and if she gathered flowers at all, it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief -- at least so it was conjectured from her always preferring those which she was forbidden to take. Such were her propensities -- her abilities were quite as extraordinary. She never could learn or understand anything before she was taught; and sometimes not even then, for she was often inattentive, and occasionally stupid. Her mother was three months in teaching her only to repeat the "Beggar's Petition"; and after all, her next sister, Sally, could say it better than she did. Not that Catherine was always stupid -- by no means; she learnt the fable of "The Hare and Many Friends" as quickly as any girl in England. Her mother wished her to learn music; and Catherine was sure she should like it, for she was very fond of tinkling the keys of the old forlorn spinner; so, at eight years old she began. She learnt a year, and could not bear it; and Mrs. Morland, who did not insist on her daughters being accomplished in spite of incapacity or distaste, allowed her to leave off. The day which dismissed the music-master was one of the happiest of Catherine's life. Her taste for drawing was not superior; though whenever she could obtain the outside of a letter from her mother or seize upon any other odd piece of paper, she did what she could in that way, by drawing houses and trees, hens and chickens, all very much like one another. Writing and accounts she was taught by her father; French by her mother: her proficiency in either was not remarkable, and she shirked her lessons in both whenever she could. What a strange, unaccountable character! -- for with all these symptoms of profligacy at ten years old, she had neither a bad heart nor a bad temper, was seldom stubborn, scarcely ever quarrelsome, and very kind to the little ones, with few interruptions of tyranny; she was moreover noisy and wild, hated confinement and cleanliness, and loved nothing so well in the world as rolling down the green slope at the back of the house.</p> 
<p>Such was Catherine Morland at ten. At fifteen, appearances were mending; she began to curl her hair and long for balls; her complexion improved, her features were softened by plumpness and colour, her eyes gained more animation, and her figure more consequence. Her love of dirt gave way to an inclination for finery, and she grew clean as she grew smart; she had now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and mother remark on her personal improvement. "Catherine grows quite a good-looking girl -- she is almost pretty today," were words which caught her ears now and then; and how welcome were the sounds! To look almost pretty is an acquisition of higher delight to a girl who has been looking plain the first fifteen years of her life than a beauty from her cradle can ever receive.</p> 
<p>Mrs. Morland was a very good woman, and wished to see her children everything they ought to be; but her time was so much occupied in lying-in and teaching the little ones, that her elder daughters were inevitably left to shift for themselves; and it was not very wonderful that Catherine, who had by nature nothing heroic about her, should prefer cricket, baseball, riding on horseback, and running about the country at the age of fourteen, to books -- or at least books of information -- for, provided that nothing like useful knowledge could be gained from them, provided they were all story and no reflection, she had never any objection to books at all. But from fifteen to seventeen she was in training for a heroine; she read all such works as heroines must read to supply their memories with those quotations which are so serviceable and so soothing in the vicissitudes of their eventful lives.</p> 
<p>From Pope, she learnt to censure those who "bear about the mockery of woe."</p> 
<p>From Gray, that "Many a flower is born to blush unseen, "And waste its fragrance on the desert air."</p> 
<p>From Thompson, that -- "It is a delightful task "To teach the young idea how to shoot."</p> 
<p>And from Shakespeare she gained a great store of information -- amongst the rest, that -- "Trifles light as air, "Are, to the jealous, confirmation strong, "As proofs of Holy Writ."</p> 
<p>That "The poor beetle, which we tread upon, "In corporal sufferance feels a pang as great "As when a giant dies."</p> 
<p>And that a young woman in love always looks -- "like Patience on a monument "Smiling at Grief."</p> 
<p>So far her improvement was sufficient -- and in many other points she came on exceedingly well; for though she could not write sonnets, she brought herself to read them; and though there seemed no chance of her throwing a whole party into raptures by a prelude on the pianoforte, of her own composition, she could listen to other people's performance with very little fatigue. Her greatest deficiency was in the pencil -- she had no notion of drawing -- not enough even to attempt a sketch of her lover's profile, that she might be detected in the design. There she fell miserably short of the true heroic height. At present she did not know her own poverty, for she had no lover to portray. She had reached the age of seventeen, without having seen one amiable youth who could call forth her sensibility, without having inspired one real passion, and without having excited even any admiration but what was very moderate and very transient. This was strange indeed! But strange things may be generally accounted for if their cause be fairly searched out. There was not one lord in the neighbourhood; no -- not even a baronet. There was not one family among their acquaintance who had reared and supported a boy accidentally found at their door -- not one young man whose origin was unknown. Her father had no ward, and the squire of the parish no children.</p> 
<p>But when a young lady is to be a heroine, the perverseness of forty surrounding families cannot prevent her. Something must and will happen to throw a hero in her way.</p> 
<p>Mr. Allen, who owned the chief of the property about Fullerton, the village in Wiltshire where the Morlands lived, was ordered to Bath for the benefit of a gouty constitution -- and his lady, a good-humoured woman, fond of Miss Morland, and probably aware that if adventures will not befall a young lady in her own village, she must seek them abroad, invited her to go with them. Mr. and Mrs. Morland were all compliance, and Catherine all happiness.</p> 
<p>凡是在凯瑟琳·莫兰的幼年时代见过她的人，谁都想不到她命中注定会成为女主角。她的家庭出身，父母的性格、她自己的品貌气质，统统对她不利。她父亲是个牧师，既不受人冷落，也没陷入贫穷。为人十分体面，不过他起了个“理查德”的俗名，长得从来不算英俊；他除了两份优厚的牧师俸禄之外，还有一笔相当可观的独立资产。而且，他一点也不喜欢把女儿关在家里。她母亲是个朴实能干的女人，她性情平和，而更为了不起的是．她身体健壮。她在凯瑟琳出世之前生过三个儿子。在生凯瑟琳时，人们都担心她活不成了，不料她还是活了下来，接连又生了六个孩子，并且眼看着他们在她身边长大成人，而她自己也一直很健康。一家人家要是养了十个孩子，个个有头有脑，四肢齐全，总被人们称作美好的家庭。不过，莫兰家除此而外。没有别的好称道的，因为这些孩子大都长得很平常。而凯瑟琳多年来一直像其他孩子一样难看。她细瘦个儿，笨里笨气的，皮肤灰里透黄，不见血色；头发又黑又直，五官粗粝。她的相貌不过如此，她的智力似乎同样不适宜作女主角。她对男孩子玩的游戏样样都喜爱。她非但不喜欢布娃娃，就连那些比较适合女主角身分的幼儿爱好，诸如养个睡鼠。喂只金丝雀，浇浇玫瑰花，她都觉得远远没有打板球来得有趣。确实，她不喜欢花园、偶尔采几朵花，那多半是出于好淘气，至少别人是这么推测的，因为她专采那些不准采的花。她就是这个脾气。她的资质也同样很特别。无论什么东西，不教就学不会，弄不懂，有时即使教过了，她也学不会，因为她往往心不在焉，时而还笨头笨脑的。她母亲花了三个月工夫，才教她背会了一首诗《乞丐请愿歌》，结果还是她的大妹妹比她背得好。凯瑟琳并非总是很笨．决非如此。《兔子和朋友》这个寓言，她比英格兰哪个姑娘学得都快。她母亲希望她学音乐，凯瑟琳也认准自己会喜欢音乐，因为她很爱拨弄那架无人问津的旧琴，于是她从八岁起便开始学习音乐。没想她学了一年便吃不消了。莫兰太太对女儿们力不从心或是不感兴趣的事情从不勉强．因此她让凯瑟琳半途而废了。辞退音乐教师那天，是凯瑟琳一生最快活的日子。她并不特别喜爱绘画，不过，每逢能从母亲那儿要来一只信封。或是随便抓到一张什么稀奇古怪的纸头，她就信笔画起来，什么房子啦，树啦。母鸡和雏鸡啦，画来画去全是一个模样。她父亲教她写字和算术。母亲教她法文。但是她哪一门都学不好，一有机会便逃避上课。这真是个不可思议的怪人！十岁的年纪就表现得如此放纵不羁。可她既没坏心眼，也没坏脾气，很少固执己见，难得与人争吵，对弟弟妹妹十分宽和．很少欺侮他们。此外，她喜欢吵闹和撒野，不愿关在家里，不爱清洁，天下的事情她最爱做的，便是躺在屋后的绿茵坡上往下打滚。</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳·莫兰十岁的时候就是这副样子。到了十五岁，她渐渐有了姿色，卷起了头发，对舞会也产生了渴望。她的肤色变得好看了，脸蛋儿也变得丰满起来，因而五官显得十分柔和。她的眼睛更有生气，身段更加惹人注目。她再也不像以前那样喜欢脏里脏气了，而是讲究起服饰来，人越长得漂亮，就越干净利落。如今，她有时能听到父母夸她出落得像个人样了，“ 凯瑟琳这丫头越长越好看，今天几乎漂亮起来了。”她耳朵里不时听到这样的赞语心里说不出有多高兴！一个女孩子生平十五年来一向相貌平平，乍一听说自己几乎漂亮起来了，那比一个生来就很美丽的少女听到这话要高兴得多。</p> 
<p>莫兰太太是个十分贤惠的女人，很希望自己的孩子个个都有出息。可惜她的时间全让分娩和抚养幼小的孩子占去了，自然顾不上几个大女儿，只能让她们自己照管自己。因此，也就难怪凯瑟琳这么个毫无女主角气质的人，在十四岁上居然宁可玩板球、棒球、骑马和四下乱跑，而却不喜欢看书，至少不喜欢看那些知识性的书。假如有这么一些书，里面不包含任何有益的知识，全是些故事情节，读起来用不着动脑筋，这样的书她倒也从不反对看。然而，从十五岁到十七岁，她在培养自己作女主角了。但凡做女主角的，有些书是势必要读的，记住内中的锦言，借以应付瞬息多变的人生，或者用来聊以自慰，而凯瑟琳也把这些书统统读过了。</p> 
<p>她从蒲柏那里学会指责这样的人，他们</p> 
<p>到处装出一副假悲伤的样子。</p> 
<p>从格雷那里学到</p> 
<p>多少花儿盛开而无人看见，</p> 
<p>他们的芳香白白浪费在荒原。</p> 
<p>从汤姆生那里，学到的是</p> 
<p>启迪青年人的思想，</p> 
<p>这是桩赏心乐事</p> 
<p>还从莎士比亚那里学到大量知识，其中有</p> 
<p>像空气一样轻的小事，</p> 
<p>对于一个嫉妒的人，</p> 
<p>也会变成天书一样有力的证据。</p> 
<p>还有</p> 
<p>被我们践踏的一只可怜的甲虫，</p> 
<p>它肉体上承受的疼痛，</p> 
<p>和一个巨人临死时感到的并无异样。</p> 
<p>一个坠入情网的少女，看上去总</p> 
<p>像是墓碑上刻着的“忍耐”的化身，</p> 
<p>在对着悲哀微笑。</p> 
<p>她在这方面已经有了长足的进步，在其他方面也获得了巨大的进展。她虽然不会写十四行诗，却下定决心要多念念。她虽然看上去无法当众演奏一支自编的钢琴序曲，让全场的人为之欣喜若狂，但她却能不知疲倦地倾听别人演奏。她最大的缺欠是在画笔上，她不懂得绘画，甚至不想给自己的情人画个侧面像，也好泄露一下天机。她在这方面实在可怜，还达不到一个真正女主角的高度。眼下，她还认识不到自己的缺欠，因为她没有情人可画。</p> 
<p>她已经长到十七岁，还不曾见到一个足以使她动情的可爱青年，也不曾使别人为她倾倒过，除了一些很有限度和瞬息即逝的羡慕之外，还不曾使人对她萌发过任何倾慕之心。这着实奇怪！但是，如果找准了原因．事情再怪也总能说个分明。原来，这附近一带没有一个勋爵，甚至连个准男爵都没有。她们相识的人家中，没有哪一家抚养过一个偶然在家门口拣到的弃婴，也没有一个出身不明的青年。凯瑟琳的父亲没有被保护人，教区里的乡绅又无儿无女。</p> 
<p>但是，当一位年轻小姐命中注定要做女主角的时候，即使方圆左近有四十户人家从中作梗，也拦她不住。事情的发展，定会给她送来一位男主角。</p> 
<p>莫兰一家住在威尔特郡的富勒顿村，村镇一带的产业大部分归一位艾伦先生所有。艾伦先生听了医生的嘱咐，准备去巴思疗养痛风病。他的太太是个和悦的女人，很喜爱莫兰小姐。她八成知道：如果一位年轻小姐在本村遇不到什么奇缘，那她应该到外地去寻求。于是便约凯瑟琳同去巴思。莫兰夫妇欣然同意，凯瑟琳也满心喜悦。</p>
