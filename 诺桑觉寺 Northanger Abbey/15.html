The two youngest Miss Thorpes were by themselves in the parlour; and, on Anne's quitting it to call her sister, Catherine took the opportunity of asking the other for some particulars of their yesterday's party. Maria desired no greater pleasure than to speak of it; and Catherine immediately learnt that it had been altogether the most delightful scheme in the world, that nobody could imagine how charming it had been, and that it had been more delightful than anybody could conceive. Such was the information of the first five minutes; the second unfolded thus much in detail -- that they had driven directly to the York Hotel, ate some soup, and bespoke an early dinner, walked down to the pump-room, tasted the water, and laid out some shillings in purses and spars; thence adjoined to eat ice at a pastry-cook's, and hurrying back to the hotel, swallowed their dinner in haste, to prevent being in the dark; and then had a delightful drive back, only the moon was not up, and it rained a little, and Mr. Morland's horse was so tired he could hardly get it along.</p> 
<p>Catherine listened with heartfelt satisfaction. It appeared that Blaize Castle had never been thought of; and, as for all the rest, there was nothing to regret for half an instant. Maria's intelligence concluded with a tender effusion of pity for her sister Anne, whom she represented as insupportably cross, from being excluded the party.</p> 
<p>"She will never forgive me, I am sure; but, you know, how could I help it? John would have me go, for he vowed he would not drive her, because she had such thick ankles. I dare say she will not be in good humour again this month; but I am determined I will not be cross; it is not a little matter that puts me out of temper."</p> 
<p>Isabella now entered the room with so eager a step, and a look of such happy importance, as engaged all her friend's notice. Maria was without ceremony sent away, and Isabella, embracing Catherine, thus began: "Yes, my dear Catherine, it is so indeed; your penetration has not deceived you. Oh! That arch eye of yours! It sees through everything."</p> 
<p>Catherine replied only by a look of wondering ignorance.</p> 
<p>"Nay, my beloved, sweetest friend," continued the other, "compose yourself. I am amazingly agitated, as you perceive. Let us sit down and talk in comfort. Well, and so you guessed it the moment you had my note? Sly creature! Oh! My dear Catherine, you alone, who know my heart, can judge of my present happiness. Your brother is the most charming of men. I only wish I were more worthy of him. But what will your excellent father and mother say? Oh! Heavens! When I think of them I am so agitated!"</p> 
<p>Catherine's understanding began to awake: an idea of the truth suddenly darted into her mind; and, with the natural blush of so new an emotion, she cried out, "Good heaven! My dear Isabella, what do you mean? Can you -- can you really be in love with James?"</p> 
<p>This bold surmise, however, she soon learnt comprehended but half the fact. The anxious affection, which she was accused of having continually watched in Isabella's every look and action, had, in the course of their yesterday's party, received the delightful confession of an equal love. Her heart and faith were alike engaged to James. Never had Catherine listened to anything so full of interest, wonder, and joy. Her brother and her friend engaged! New to such circumstances, the importance of it appeared unspeakably great, and she contemplated it as one of those grand events, of which the ordinary course of life can hardly afford a return. The strength of her feelings she could not express; the nature of them, however, contented her friend. The happiness of having such a sister was their first effusion, and the fair ladies mingled in embraces and tears of joy.</p> 
<p>Delighting, however, as Catherine sincerely did in the prospect of the connection, it must be acknowledged that Isabella far surpassed her in tender anticipations. "You will be so infinitely dearer to me, my Catherine, than either Anne or Maria: I feel that I shall be so much more attached to my dear Morland's family than to my own."</p> 
<p>This was a pitch of friendship beyond Catherine.</p> 
<p>"You are so like your dear brother," continued Isabella, "that I quite doted on you the first moment I saw you. But so it always is with me; the first moment settles everything. The very first day that Morland came to us last Christmas -- the very first moment I beheld him -- my heart was irrecoverably gone. I remember I wore my yellow gown, with my hair done up in braids; and when I came into the drawing-room, and John introduced him, I thought I never saw anybody so handsome before."</p> 
<p>Here Catherine secretly acknowledged the power of love; for, though exceedingly fond of her brother, and partial to all his endowments, she had never in her life thought him handsome.</p> 
<p>"I remember too, Miss Andrews drank tea with us that evening, and wore her puce-coloured sarsenet; and she looked so heavenly that I thought your brother must certainly fall in love with her; I could not sleep a wink all right for thinking of it. Oh! Catherine, the many sleepless nights I have had on your brother's account! I would not have you suffer half what I have done! I am grown wretchedly thin, I know; but I will not pain you by describing my anxiety; you have seen enough of it. I feel that I have betrayed myself perpetually -- so unguarded in speaking of my partiality for the church! But my secret I was always sure would be safe with you."</p> 
<p>Catherine felt that nothing could have been safer; but ashamed of an ignorance little expected, she dared no longer contest the point, nor refuse to have been as full of arch penetration and affectionate sympathy as Isabella chose to consider her. Her brother, she found, was preparing to set off with all speed to Fullerton, to make known his situation and ask consent; and here was a source of some real agitation to the mind of Isabella. Catherine endeavoured to persuade her, as she was herself persuaded, that her father and mother would never oppose their son's wishes. "It is impossible," said she, "for parents to be more kind, or more desirous of their children's happiness; I have no doubt of their consenting immediately."</p> 
<p>"Morland says exactly the same," replied Isabella; "and yet I dare not expect it; my fortune will be so small; they never can consent to it. Your brother, who might marry anybody!"</p> 
<p>Here Catherine again discerned the force of love.</p> 
<p>"Indeed, Isabella, you are too humble. The difference of fortune can be nothing to signify."</p> 
<p>"Oh! My sweet Catherine, in your generous heart I know it would signify nothing; but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many. As for myself, I am sure I only wish our situations were reversed. Had I the command of millions, were I mistress of the whole world, your brother would be my only choice."</p> 
<p>This charming sentiment, recommended as much by sense as novelty, gave Catherine a most pleasing remembrance of all the heroines of her acquaintance; and she thought her friend never looked more lovely than in uttering the grand idea. "I am sure they will consent," was her frequent declaration; "I am sure they will be delighted with you."</p> 
<p>"For my own part," said Isabella, "my wishes are so moderate that the smallest income in nature would be enough for me. Where people are really attached, poverty itself is wealth; grandeur I detest: I would not settle in London for the universe. A cottage in some retired village would be ecstasy. There are some charming little villas about Richmond."</p> 
<p>"Richmond!" cried Catherine. "You must settle near Fullerton. You must be near us."</p> 
<p>"I am sure I shall be miserable if we do not. If I can but be near you, I shall be satisfied. But this is idle talking! I will not allow myself to think of such things, till we have your father's answer. Morland says that by sending it tonight to Salisbury, we may have it tomorrow. Tomorrow? I know I shall never have courage to open the letter. I know it will be the death of me."</p> 
<p>A reverie succeeded this conviction -- and when Isabella spoke again, it was to resolve on the quality of her wedding-gown.</p> 
<p>Their conference was put an end to by the anxious young lover himself, who came to breathe his parting sigh before he set off for Wiltshire. Catherine wished to congratulate him, but knew not what to say, and her eloquence was only in her eyes. From them, however, the eight parts of speech shone out most expressively, and James could combine them with ease. Impatient for the realization of all that he hoped at home, his adieus were not long; and they would have been yet shorter, had he not been frequently detained by the urgent entreaties of his fair one that he would go. Twice was he called almost from the door by her eagerness to have him gone. "Indeed, Morland, I must drive you away. Consider how far you have to ride. I cannot bear to see you linger so. For heaven's sake, waste no more time. There, go, go -- I insist on it."</p> 
<p>The two friends, with hearts now more united than ever, were inseparable for the day; and in schemes of sisterly happiness the hours flew along. Mrs. Thorpe and her son, who were acquainted with everything, and who seemed only to want Mr. Morland's consent, to consider Isabella's engagement as the most fortunate circumstance imaginable for their family, were allowed to join their counsels, and add their quota of significant looks and mysterious expressions to fill up the measure of curiosity to be raised in the unprivileged younger sisters. To Catherine's simple feelings, this odd sort of reserve seemed neither kindly meant, nor consistently supported; and its unkindness she would hardly have forborne pointing out, had its inconsistency been less their friend; but Anne and Maria soon set her heart at ease by the sagacity of their "I know what"; and the evening was spent in a sort of war of wit, a display of family ingenuity, on one side in the mystery of an affected secret, on the other of undefined discovery, all equally acute.</p> 
<p>Catherine was with her friend again the next day, endeavouring to support her spirits and while away the many tedious hours before the delivery of the letters; a needful exertion, for as the time of reasonable expectation drew near, Isabella became more and more desponding, and before the letter arrived, had worked herself into a state of real distress. But when it did come, where could distress be found? "I have had no difficulty in gaining the consent of my kind parents, and am promised that everything in their power shall be done to forward my happiness," were the first three lines, and in one moment all was joyful security. The brightest glow was instantly spread over Isabella's features, all care and anxiety seemed removed, her spirits became almost too high for control, and she called herself without scruple the happiest of mortals.</p> 
<p>Mrs. Thorpe, with tears of joy, embraced her daughter, her son, her visitor, and could have embraced half the inhabitants of Bath with satisfaction. Her heart was overflowing with tenderness. It was "dear John" and "dear Catherine" at every word; "dear Anne and dear Maria" must immediately be made sharers in their felicity; and two "dears" at once before the name of Isabella were not more than that beloved child had now well earned. John himself was no skulker in joy. He not only bestowed on Mr. Morland the high commendation of being one of the finest fellows in the world, but swore off many sentences in his praise.</p> 
<p>The letter, whence sprang all this felicity, was short, containing little more than this assurance of success; and every particular was deferred till James could write again. But for particulars Isabella could well afford to wait. The needful was comprised in Mr. Morland's promise; his honour was pledged to make everything easy; and by what means their income was to be formed, whether landed property were to be resigned, or funded money made over, was a matter in which her disinterested spirit took no concern. She knew enough to feel secure of an honourable and speedy establishment, and her imagination took a rapid flight over its attendant felicities. She saw herself at the end of a few weeks, the gaze and admiration of every new acquaintance at Fullerton, the envy of every valued old friend in Putney, with a carriage at her command, a new name on her tickets, and a brilliant exhibition of hoop rings on her finger.</p> 
<p>When the contents of the letter were ascertained, John Thorpe, who had only waited its arrival to begin his journey to London, prepared to set off. "Well, Miss Morland," said he, on finding her alone in the parlour, "I am come to bid you good-bye." Catherine wished him a good journey. Without appearing to hear her, he walked to the window, fidgeted about, hummed a tune, and seemed wholly self-occupied.</p> 
<p>"Shall not you be late at Devizes?" said Catherine. He made no answer; but after a minute's silence burst out with, "A famous good thing this marrying scheme, upon my soul! A clever fancy of Morland's and Belle's. What do you think of it, Miss Morland? I say it is no bad notion."</p> 
<p>"I am sure I think it a very good one."</p> 
<p>"Do you? That's honest, by heavens! I am glad you are no enemy to matrimony, however. Did you ever hear the old song 'Going to One Wedding Brings on Another?' I say, you will come to Belle's wedding, I hope."</p> 
<p>"Yes; I have promised your sister to be with her, if possible."</p> 
<p>"And then you know" -- twisting himself about and forcing a foolish laugh -- "I say, then you know, we may try the truth of this same old song."</p> 
<p>"May we? But I never sing. Well, I wish you a good journey. I dine with Miss Tilney today, and must now be going home."</p> 
<p>"Nay, but there is no such confounded hurry. Who knows when we may be together again? Not but that I shall be down again by the end of a fortnight, and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me."</p> 
<p>"Then why do you stay away so long?" replied Catherine -- finding that he waited for an answer.</p> 
<p>"That is kind of you, however -- kind and good-natured. I shall not forget it in a hurry. But you have more good nature and all that, than anybody living, I believe. A monstrous deal of good nature, and it is not only good nature, but you have so much, so much of everything; and then you have such -- upon my soul, I do not know anybody like you."</p> 
<p>"Oh! dear, there are a great many people like me, I dare say, only a great deal better. Good morning to you."</p> 
<p>"But I say, Miss Morland, I shall come and pay my respects at Fullerton before it is long, if not disagreeable."</p> 
<p>"Pray do. My father and mother will be very glad to see you."</p> 
<p>"And I hope -- I hope, Miss Morland, you will not be sorry to see me."</p> 
<p>"Oh! dear, not at all. There are very few people I am sorry to see. Company is always cheerful."</p> 
<p>"That is just my way of thinking. Give me but a little cheerful company, let me only have the company of the people I love, let me only be where I like and with whom I like, and the devil take the rest, say I. And I am heartily glad to hear you say the same. But I have a notion, Miss Morland, you and I think pretty much alike upon most matters."</p> 
<p>"Perhaps we may; but it is more than I ever thought of. And as to most matters, to say the truth, there are not many that I know my own mind about."</p> 
<p>"By Jove, no more do I. It is not my way to bother my brains with what does not concern me. My notion of things is simple enough. Let me only have the girl I like, say I, with a comfortable house over my head, and what care I for all the rest? Fortune is nothing. I am sure of a good income of my own; and if she had not a penny, why, so much the better."</p> 
<p>"Very true. I think like you there. If there is a good fortune on one side, there can be no occasion for any on the other. No matter which has it, so that there is enough. I hate the idea of one great fortune looking out for another. And to marry for money I think the wickedest thing in existence. Good day. We shall be very glad to see you at Fullerton, whenever it is convenient." And away she went. It was not in the power of all his gallantry to detain her longer. With such news to communicate, and such a visit to prepare for, her departure was not to be delayed by anything in his nature to urge; and she hurried away, leaving him to the undivided consciousness of his own happy address, and her explicit encouragement.</p> 
<p>The agitation which she had herself experienced on first learning her brother's engagement made her expect to raise no inconsiderable emotion in Mr. and Mrs. Allen, by the communication of the wonderful event. How great was her disappointment! The important affair, which many words of preparation ushered in, had been foreseen by them both ever since her brother's arrival; and all that they felt on the occasion was comprehended in a wish for the young people's happiness, with a remark, on the gentleman's side, in favour of Isabella's beauty, and on the lady's, of her great good luck. It was to Catherine the most surprising insensibility. The disclosure, however, of the great secret of James's going to Fullerton the day before, did raise some emotion in Mrs. Allen. She could not listen to that with perfect calmness, but repeatedly regretted the necessity of its concealment, wished she could have known his intention, wished she could have seen him before he went, as she should certainly have troubled him with her best regards to his father and mother, and her kind compliments to all the Skinners.</p> 
<p>第二天一早，凯瑟琳收到伊莎贝拉的一封信，字字行行都写得、心平气和，情意绵绵，恳求她的朋友立即去一趟，有极其要紧的事情要谈。凯瑟琳一听说有要紧事，觉得十分好奇，便带着万分喜悦的心情，急匆匆地赶到埃德加大楼。客厅里只有索普家的两位小女儿。安妮小姐跑去喊她姐姐时，凯瑟琳趁机向另一位小姐问起昨天出游的情况。玛丽亚向往的最大乐趣就是谈论这件事。</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳马上便听说：那是世界上最最愉快的一次旅行。谁也想象不到有多好玩，谁也想象不到多有意思。这是头五分钟的消息，随后五分钟透露了大量细枝末节，说他们径直驶到约克旅馆。喝了点汤，预订了一顿午餐，走到矿泉厅，尝了尝矿泉水。花了几先令买了钱包和晶石；又从那里去点心铺吃冷饮，为了避免摸黑走路，又赶紧回到旅馆，匆匆忙忙地吃完饭。回家的路上走得很愉快，只可惜月亮没出来，下了点小雨，莫兰先生的马累得都快走不动了。</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳听得打心眼里感到高兴。看来，他们根本没想到要去布莱兹城堡，除此之外，她没有任何事情可以感到惋惜的。玛丽亚说到临了，还情意深长地对她姐姐安妮表示了一番同情，说她因为没去成而气得不得了。</p> 
<p>“她肯定永远不会原谅我。不过你知道．我又有什么法子？约翰非要让我去，因为他嫌安妮脚脖子太粗，说什么也不肯带她去。她这个月怕是再也快活不起来了。不过我可决不会闹别扭，我是不会为一丁点小事生气发火的。”</p> 
<p>这时，伊莎贝拉急匆匆地走进屋来，只见她神气十足，满面春风，让她的朋友都看愣了。伊莎贝拉老实不客气地撵走了玛丽亚，然后一把搂住凯瑟琳，开口说道：“是的，亲爱的凯瑟琳，的确如此。你看得不错。唔，你那双眼睛真利害！能洞察一切。”</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳没有答话，只显出一副疑惑不解的神情。</p> 
<p>“唔，得了，我心爱的，最可爱的朋友，“伊莎贝拉接着说道，“镇静点。你看得出来，我心里万分激动。我们还是坐下来，舒舒服服地讲。唔，这么说来、你一见到我的信就猜着了？狡猾鬼！哦！亲爱的凯瑟琳，唯有你了解我的心，能够判断我眼下有多幸福。你哥哥是世界上最可爱的男人。但愿我更能配得上他。不过今尊和令堂会怎么说呢？哦，天哪！我想起他们．心里可就乱了套啦！”</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳开始醒悟，她突然明白了这是怎么回事。心里一激动，自然涨得满脸通红，只听她大声嚷道：“天哪！我亲爱的伊莎贝拉，你这是什么意恩？难道—一难道你当真爱上了詹姆斯？”</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳马上得知。她这个大胆的推测仅仅猜对了事情的一半。伊莎贝拉责备过凯瑟琳，说她总能从伊莎贝拉的每个神色、每个举动中看出殷切的钟情，在昨天的远游中，詹姆斯可喜地向她表露了同样的钟情。她把自己的忠贞和爱情交给了詹姆斯。凯瑟琳从未听到如此有趣、如此奇异、如此欣喜的事情。她哥哥和她的朋友订婚了！没有这种经历的人，不会觉得这件事有多么了不起。</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳认为这是普通生活里难得重演的一件大事。她无法表达心里的强烈感情，然而这种感情却使她的朋友感到得意。她们首先倾吐了要作姑嫂的喜悦，两位漂亮小姐紧紧地抱在一起，洒下了欣喜的泪花。</p> 
<p>对于这起姻缘．凯瑟琳真心实意地感到高兴。不过应该承认：在预期她们将来的亲切关系这方面，她远远及不上伊莎贝拉。“凯瑟琳，对我来说，你比安妮和玛丽亚不知道要亲切多少倍。我觉得，我喜爱亲爱的莫兰家的人，会大大胜过喜爱自己家的人。”</p> 
<p>这是凯瑟琳不可企及的一种友谊高度。</p> 
<p>“你真像你亲爱的哥哥，”伊莎贝拉继续说道，“我刚一见到你就喜爱得不得了。不过我总是这样：什么事情都是一眼定局。去年圣诞节莫兰来我们家的头一天，我头一眼见到他，我的心便一去不复返了。我记得我穿着我那件黄长裙，头上盘着辫子。当我走进客厅，约翰介绍他时，我心想我以前从未见过这么漂亮的人。”</p> 
<p>一听到这话，凯瑟琳心里暗暗佩服爱情的威力，因为她虽说极其喜爱自己的哥哥，赞赏他的种种天赋，但她平生从不认为他长得漂亮。</p> 
<p>“我还记得，那天晚上安德鲁斯小姐和我们一道喝茶，穿着她那件紫褐色的薄绸子衣服，看上去像天仙一样，我还以为你哥哥肯定会爱上她呢。我想着这件事，整夜都没合眼。哦！凯瑟琳，我为你哥哥经历了多少个不眠之夜呀！我所忍受的痛苦，我一半也不想让你忍受！我知道我现在瘦得可怜，不过我不想叙说我的忧虑，省得惹你难过。你已经看得足够了。我觉得我不断地泄露自己的秘密，没有心计地说出了我喜欢做牧师的人！不过我总相信你会替我保密的。”</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳心想，没有什么比这更保险的了。不过她又为对方没料到自己这么一无所知而感到羞愧，便不敢再争辩。而且，伊莎贝拉硬要说她目光敏锐，为人亲切，富有同情心，她也不便否认。</p> 
<p>她发现，她哥哥准备火速赶到富勒顿，说明他的情况，请求父母的同意。伊莎贝拉为这件事倒着实有点忐忑不安。凯瑟琳相信，她父母决不会反对儿子的心愿，于是便尽力这样劝慰伊莎贝拉。“做父母的，”她说，“不可能有比他们更慈祥，更希望自己的子女得到幸福的。毫无疑问，他们会立刻同意的。”</p> 
<p>“莫兰说的跟你一模一样，”伊莎贝拉答道，“然而我还不敢抱这个希望。我的财产太少了，他们决不会同意的。你哥哥娶什么人不行。”</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳再次觉察到爱情的威力。</p> 
<p>“伊莎贝拉，你真是太自谦了。财产上的差别算得了什么。”</p> 
<p>“唔！亲爱的凯瑟琳，你是宽怀大度的。我知道，在你看来，这算不了什么，可是我们不能期待多数人都不计较。就我来说，我真但愿我们能换个地位。我即使掌管着几百万镑，主宰着全世界，你哥哥也是我唯一的选择。</p> 
<p>她这有趣的想法既富有见识，又别出心裁，使凯瑟琳极其愉快地记起了她所熟识的所有女主角。她心想，她的朋友倾吐这般崇高的思想时，看上去从来没有这么动人过。“他们肯定会同意的，”她一再宣称，“他们肯定会喜欢你的。”</p> 
<p>“至于我自己，”伊莎贝拉说道，“我的要求很低，哪怕是最微薄的收入也够我用的了。人们要是真心相爱，贫穷本身就是财富。我讨厌豪华的生活。我无论如何也不要住到伦敦。能在偏僻的村镇有座乡舍，这就够迷人的了。里士满附近有几座小巧可爱的别墅。”</p> 
<p>“里士满！”凯瑟琳惊叫道，“你们必须住到富勒顿附近！你们必须离我们近一点！”</p> 
<p>“若不是这样，我肯定要沮丧的。只要能离你很近，我就心满意足了。不过这是空谈！在得到你父亲的答复之前，我不该考虑这种事。莫兰说，今天晚上把信发到索尔兹伯里，明天就能接到回信。明天啊！我知道我决没有勇气打开那封信。我知道它会要我的命。”</p> 
<p>伊莎贝拉说完这话，接着出了一阵神。她再开口时，谈起了要用什么料子做结婚礼服。</p> 
<p>她们的谈话被那焦灼不安的情郎打断了，他趁动身去威尔特郡之前，先来这里惜个别。凯瑟琳本想向他道喜，可是不知说啥为好，满肚子的话全含在眼神里。在那双眼睛里，八大词类活脱脱地应有尽有，詹姆斯可以得心应手地把它们串联起来。他一心急着回家实现自己的愿望，告别的时间并不长，若不是因为他的美人一再催他快走反而耽搁了，他告别的时间还要短些。有两次，他几乎走到门口了，伊莎贝拉还急火火地把他叫回来，催他快走。</p> 
<p>“莫兰，我真要把你赶走啦。想想你要骑多远啊。我不能容忍你这么拖拖拉拉的。看在老天爷的份上，别再磨蹭时间啦。好了，走吧，走吧——你一定要走。”</p> 
<p>现在，两位女友的心比以往拧得更紧了，整天都割舍不开。两人姐妹般地寻找快乐，不觉时间过得飞快。索普太太和她的儿子了解全部内情，似乎只要莫兰先生一同意，就会把伊莎贝拉的订婚当作他们家里最可庆幸的一件大事，因而可以一道来谈论，他们那意味深长的神色和神秘莫测的表情，使得那两位蒙在鼓里的小妹妹也感到很好奇。凯瑟琳思想比较单纯，在她看来，这种莫名其妙的隐瞒似乎既非出自好意，也未能贯彻始终。他们若是始终隐瞒下去的话，她早就忍不住要指出他们这样做实在太没情义了。不料安妮和玛丽亚机灵地说了声“我知道怎么回事”，马上使她放下心来。到了晚上．居然还斗起智来、一家人都在各显其能；一边闪闪烁烁地故作神秘，一边隐约其词地硬说知道，真是针锋相对。</p> 
<p>第二天．凯瑟琳又去和她的朋友做伴，尽量使她打起精神，消磨来信之前的这段烦人的时光。她这样做是大有必要的，因为快到该来信的时候，伊莎贝拉变得越来越颓丧，信还没到，她真的忧心仲仲起来。等信一到．哪里还能见到忧虑的踪影？“我顺利地取得了我慈爱的双亲的同意，他们答应将竭尽全力促进我的幸福。”这是头三行的内容，顷刻间，一切都令人欣喜地有了保证。伊莎贝拉顿时红光满面，神采奕奕——一切忧虑和焦灼似乎一扫而光，她简直抑制不住内心的喜悦，毫无顾忌地称自己是人间最幸福的人儿。</p> 
<p>索普太太喜泪盈眶，挨个地拥抱着女儿、儿子和客人，兴奋得简直想把巴思的半数居民都拥抱一遍。她心里充满了柔情蜜意，开口一个“亲爱的约翰”，闭口一个“亲爱的凯瑟琳”、说什么必须马上让“亲爱的安妮和亲爱的玛丽亚”也来分享他们的喜悦；还在伊莎贝拉的名字前面一次用了两个“亲爱的”，这是那个可爱的孩子受之无愧的。约翰高兴起来也毫不掩饰。他不仅推崇备至地把莫兰先生称作天下最好的人，而且赌咒发誓地说了许多赞美他的话语。</p> 
<p>带来这一切喜悦的那封信写得很短，里面只是保证大功已经告成，一切详情细节还得挨到詹姆斯以后来信再说。不过，那些详情细节伊莎贝拉完全可以等待。她所必需的一切全都包含在莫兰先生的许诺之中：他保证办得万事如意。至于如何筹措收入，究竟是分给田产还是交给资金，这些她都一概不去关心。她心里有数，觉得自己可以十拿九稳地很快便会有一个像样的家庭。她的想象在围绕着心目中的幸福驰骋。她幻想几周以后富勒顿新结识的朋友都在注视她，艳羡她，普尔蒂尼可贵的老友都在妒忌她。她有一辆马车供自己受用，她的名片换了新的姓，手指上戴着光彩夺目的钻石戒指。</p> 
<p>约翰·索普本来只等信一到就启程去伦敦，现在既然知道了信的内容，他便准备动身了。“莫兰小姐，”他发现她独自一人呆在客厅时，说道，“我是来向你辞行的。”凯瑟琳祝他一路平安。约翰似乎没有听见她的话，走到窗口，身子不安地扭来扭去。嘴里哼着曲子，仿佛一门心思在想自己的事。</p> 
<p>“你去德魏泽斯不会迟到吧？”凯瑟琳问，约翰没有回答。但是，沉默了一阵之后，他猝然说道：“说实话，结婚这个主意真是太好了！莫兰和贝尔的想象太妙了。你觉得怎么样、莫兰小姐？我说这个主意不赖。”</p> 
<p>“我当然认为很好啦。”</p> 
<p>“是吗？老天在上，这才叫真心话！我很高兴，你不反对结婚。你有没有听见过《参加婚礼可以促成良缘》这首老歌谣？我是说，希望你来参加贝尔的婚礼。”</p> 
<p>“是的，我已经答应你妹妹，要是可能，就来陪伴她。”</p> 
<p>“可你知道．”他把身子扭来扭去的，勉强傻笑一声，“我是说，可你知道，我们可以试试这首老歌谣说的灵不灵。”</p> 
<p>“我们？可我从来不唱歌呀。好了、祝你一路平安。我今天和蒂尔尼小姐一道吃饭，现在得回家了。”</p> 
<p>“得了，不要这么急急忙忙的。谁知道我们何时才能再见面！不过我两周后还要回来的。在我看来，这将是遥遥无期的两周。”</p> 
<p>“那你为什么要走这么久呢？”凯瑟琳见他在等她答话，便如此答道。</p> 
<p>“你真客气。既客气又温存。我不会轻易忘记的。我相信，你在性情上比任何人都温柔，你的性情好极了。不仅仅是性情好。而且什么——而且什么都好。再说，你还这样——－凭良心说，我从没见过像你这样的人。”</p> 
<p>“哦，天哪！像我这样的人实在多得很，只是比我强得多。再见。”</p> 
<p>“可我是说，莫兰小姐，如不嫌弃的话，我不久会来富勒顿拜访的。”</p> 
<p>“请来吧。我父母亲见到你会很高兴的。”</p> 
<p>“我希望——我希望，莫兰小姐，你见到我不会很遗憾吧。”</p> 
<p>“哦，天哪，决不会！没有几个人我见到会感到遗憾的。有人来往总是令人愉快的。”</p> 
<p>“我正是这么想的。我常说，让我有几个愉快的伙伴，让我只和我喜爱的人在一起，只和我喜爱的人呆在我喜爱的地方，剩下的事都见鬼去吧．听你也这样说，我打心眼里感到高兴。我有个看法，莫兰小姐，你我对多数问题的看法十分相似。”</p> 
<p>“也许可能。不过这是我从没想到的。至于说多数问题，说老实话，我在很多问题上并没有自己的看法。”</p> 
<p>“啊，我也是如此！我向来不愿为那些与我无关的事情伤脑筋。我对事情的看法很简单。我常说，只要让我有了我心爱的姑娘，再有一座舒适的房屋，别的事情我还在乎什么？财产是无足轻重的。反正我有一笔可观的收入。要是姑娘不名一文，岂不更好。”</p> 
<p>“的确是。在这件事上，我与你的看法是一样的。如果一方有一笔可观的财产，另一方就用不着再有什么了。不管哪一方有财产，反正够用了就行。一个有钱人去找另一个有钱人，我讨厌这样的念头。为了金钱而结婚，我认为这是天下最卑劣的事情。再见。你无论什么时候得便来富勒顿，我们见到你都会十分高兴。”</p> 
<p>她说罢拔腿就走。约翰尽管百般殷勤，却无能为力再挽留她了。凯瑟琳回去有这样的消息要传播，有这样一个约会要准备，任凭约翰再怎么强留，她还是不肯耽搁。她匆匆地走了。留下约翰一门心思想着自己的巧言妙语和凯瑟琳的明显怂恿。</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳最初听说哥哥订婚时由于自己心情激动，便不由觉得：她要是把这奇妙的事情告诉艾伦夫妇．也能引起不小的激动。但是她有多失望啊！她绕了好多弯子才提到的这件大事，原来自她哥哥到达以后，早被艾伦夫妇预料到。这当儿，他们的全部感触都包含在一个祝愿里，祝愿这对青年人幸福。同时还一人议论了一句，先生赞赏伊莎贝拉长得美，太太说她福气大。在凯瑟琳看来，这种麻木不仁的态度实在太令人惊讶了。不过，当凯瑟琳透露了詹姆斯头天去富勒顿这个重大秘密时，艾伦太太总算有了些反应。她无法平心静气地听下去，屡次抱憾说这也要保密，可惜她事先不知道詹姆斯要走，没在他行前见到他，否则她肯定要托他向他父母问好，向斯金纳一家人致意。</p>
