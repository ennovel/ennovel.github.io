"This lengthened absence, these solitary rambles, did not speak a mind at ease, or a conscience void of reproach." At length he appeared; and, whatever might have been the gloom of his meditations, he could still smile with them. Miss Tilney, understanding in part her friend's curiosity to see the house, soon revived the subject; and her father being, contrary to Catherine's expectations, unprovided with any pretence for further delay, beyond that of stopping five minutes to order refreshments to be in the room by their return, was at last ready to escort them.</p> 
<p>They set forward; and, with a grandeur of air, a dignified step, which caught the eye, but could not shake the doubts of the well-read Catherine, he led the way across the hall, through the common drawing-room and one useless antechamber, into a room magnificent both in size and furniture -- the real drawing-room, used only with company of consequence. It was very noble -- very grand -- very charming! -- was all that Catherine had to say, for her indiscriminating eye scarcely discerned the colour of the satin; and all minuteness of praise, all praise that had much meaning, was supplied by the general: the costliness or elegance of any room's fitting-up could be nothing to her; she cared for no furniture of a more modern date than the fifteenth century. When the general had satisfied his own curiosity, in a close examination of every well-known ornament, they proceeded into the library, an apartment, in its way, of equal magnificence, exhibiting a collection of books, on which an humble man might have looked with pride. Catherine heard, admired, and wondered with more genuine feeling than before -- gathered all that she could from this storehouse of knowledge, by running over the titles of half a shelf, and was ready to proceed. But suites of apartments did not spring up with her wishes. Large as was the building, she had already visited the greatest part; though, on being told that, with the addition of the kitchen, the six or seven rooms she had now seen surrounded three sides of the court, she could scarcely believe it, or overcome the suspicion of there being many chambers secreted. It was some relief, however, that they were to return to the rooms in common use, by passing through a few of less importance, looking into the court, which, with occasional passages, not wholly unintricate, connected the different sides; and she was further soothed in her progress by being told that she was treading what had once been a cloister, having traces of cells pointed out, and observing several doors that were neither opened nor explained to her -- by finding herself successively in a billiard-room, and in the general's private apartment, without comprehending their connection, or being able to turn aright when she left them; and lastly, by passing through a dark little room, owning Henry's authority, and strewed with his litter of books, guns, and greatcoats.</p> 
<p>From the dining-room, of which, though already seen, and always to be seen at five o'clock, the general could not forgo the pleasure of pacing out the length, for the more certain information of Miss Morland, as to what she neither doubted nor cared for, they proceeded by quick communication to the kitchen -- the ancient kitchen of the convent, rich in the massy walls and smoke of former days, and in the stoves and hot closets of the present. The general's improving hand had not loitered here: every modern invention to facilitate the labour of the cooks had been adopted within this, their spacious theatre; and, when the genius of others had failed, his own had often produced the perfection wanted. His endowments of this spot alone might at any time have placed him high among the benefactors of the convent.</p> 
<p>With the walls of the kitchen ended all the antiquity of the abbey; the fourth side of the quadrangle having, on account of its decaying state, been removed by the general's father, and the present erected in its place. All that was venerable ceased here. The new building was not only new, but declared itself to be so; intended only for offices, and enclosed behind by stable-yards, no uniformity of architecture had been thought necessary. Catherine could have raved at the hand which had swept away what must have been beyond the value of all the rest, for the purposes of mere domestic economy; and would willingly have been spared the mortification of a walk through scenes so fallen, had the general allowed it; but if he had a vanity, it was in the arrangement of his offices; and as he was convinced that, to a mind like Miss Morland's, a view of the accommodations and comforts, by which the labours of her inferiors were softened, must always be gratifying, he should make no apology for leading her on. They took a slight survey of all; and Catherine was impressed, beyond her expectation, by their multiplicity and their convenience. The purposes for which a few shapeless pantries and a comfortless scullery were deemed sufficient at Fullerton, were here carried on in appropriate divisions, commodious and roomy. The number of servants continually appearing did not strike her less than the number of their offices. Wherever they went, some pattened girl stopped to curtsy, or some footman in dishabille sneaked off. Yet this was an abbey! How inexpressibly different in these domestic arrangements from such as she had read about -- from abbeys and castles, in which, though certainly larger than Northanger, all the dirty work of the house was to be done by two pair of female hands at the utmost. How they could get through it all had often amazed Mrs. Allen; and, when Catherine saw what was necessary here, she began to be amazed herself.</p> 
<p>They returned to the hall, that the chief staircase might be ascended, and the beauty of its wood, and ornaments of rich carving might be pointed out: having gained the top, they turned in an opposite direction from the gallery in which her room lay, and shortly entered one on the same plan, but superior in length and breadth. She was here shown successively into three large bed-chambers, with their dressing-rooms, most completely and handsomely fitted up; everything that money and taste could do, to give comfort and elegance to apartments, had been bestowed on these; and, being furnished within the last five years, they were perfect in all that would be generally pleasing, and wanting in all that could give pleasure to Catherine. As they were surveying the last, the general, after slightly naming a few of the distinguished characters by whom they had at times been honoured, turned with a smiling countenance to Catherine, and ventured to hope that henceforward some of their earliest tenants might be "our friends from Fullerton." She felt the unexpected compliment, and deeply regretted the impossibility of thinking well of a man so kindly disposed towards herself, and so full of civility to all her family.</p> 
<p>The gallery was terminated by folding doors, which Miss Tilney, advancing, had thrown open, and passed through, and seemed on the point of doing the same by the first door to the left, in another long reach of gallery, when the general, coming forwards, called her hastily, and, as Catherine thought, rather angrily back, demanding whether she were going? -- And what was there more to be seen? -- Had not Miss Morland already seen all that could be worth her notice? -- And did she not suppose her friend might be glad of some refreshment after so much exercise? Miss Tilney drew back directly, and the heavy doors were closed upon the mortified Catherine, who, having seen, in a momentary glance beyond them, a narrower passage, more numerous openings, and symptoms of a winding staircase, believed herself at last within the reach of something worth her notice; and felt, as she unwillingly paced back the gallery, that she would rather be allowed to examine that end of the house than see all the finery of all the rest. The general's evident desire of preventing such an examination was an additional stimulant. Something was certainly to be concealed; her fancy, though it had trespassed lately once or twice, could not mislead her here; and what that something was, a short sentence of Miss Tilney's, as they followed the general at some distance downstairs, seemed to point out: "I was going to take you into what was my mother's room -- the room in which she died -- " were all her words; but few as they were, they conveyed pages of intelligence to Catherine. It was no wonder that the general should shrink from the sight of such objects as that room must contain; a room in all probability never entered by him since the dreadful scene had passed, which released his suffering wife, and left him to the stings of conscience.</p> 
<p>She ventured, when next alone with Eleanor, to express her wish of being permitted to see it, as well as all the rest of that side of the house; and Eleanor promised to attend her there, whenever they should have a convenient hour. Catherine understood her: the general must be watched from home, before that room could be entered. "It remains as it was, I suppose?" said she, in a tone of feeling.</p> 
<p>"Yes, entirely."</p> 
<p>"And how long ago may it be that your mother died?"</p> 
<p>"She has been dead these nine years." And nine years, Catherine knew, was a trifle of time, compared with what generally elapsed after the death of an injured wife, before her room was put to rights.</p> 
<p>"You were with her, I suppose, to the last?"</p> 
<p>"No," said Miss Tilney, sighing; "I was unfortunately from home. Her illness was sudden and short; and, before I arrived it was all over."</p> 
<p>Catherine's blood ran cold with the horrid suggestions which naturally sprang from these words. Could it be possible? Could Henry's father -- ? And yet how many were the examples to justify even the blackest suspicions! And, when she saw him in the evening, while she worked with her friend, slowly pacing the drawing-room for an hour together in silent thoughtfulness, with downcast eyes and contracted brow, she felt secure from all possibility of wronging him. It was the air and attitude of a Montoni! What could more plainly speak the gloomy workings of a mind not wholly dead to every sense of humanity, in its fearful review of past scenes of guilt? Unhappy man! And the anxiousness of her spirits directed her eyes towards his figure so repeatedly, as to catch Miss Tilney's notice. "My father," she whispered, "often walks about the room in this way; it is nothing unusual."</p> 
<p>"So much the worse!" thought Catherine; such ill-timed exercise was of a piece with the strange unseasonableness of his morning walks, and boded nothing good.</p> 
<p>After an evening, the little variety and seeming length of which made her peculiarly sensible of Henry's importance among them, she was heartily glad to be dismissed; though it was a look from the general not designed for her observation which sent his daughter to the bell. When the butler would have lit his master's candle, however, he was forbidden. The latter was not going to retire. "I have many pamphlets to finish," said he to Catherine, "before I can close my eyes, and perhaps may be poring over the affairs of the nation for hours after you are asleep. Can either of us be more meetly employed? My eyes will be blinding for the good of others, and yours preparing by rest for future mischief."</p> 
<p>But neither the business alleged, nor the magnificent compliment, could win Catherine from thinking that some very different object must occasion so serious a delay of proper repose. To be kept up for hours, after the family were in bed, by stupid pamphlets was not very likely. There must be some deeper cause: something was to be done which could be done only while the household slept; and the probability that Mrs. Tilney yet lived, shut up for causes unknown, and receiving from the pitiless hands of her husband a nightly supply of coarse food, was the conclusion which necessarily followed. Shocking as was the idea, it was at least better than a death unfairly hastened, as, in the natural course of things, she must ere long be released. The suddenness of her reputed illness, the absence of her daughter, and probably of her other children, at the time -- all favoured the supposition of her imprisonment. Its origin -- jealousy perhaps, or wanton cruelty -- was yet to be unravelled.</p> 
<p>In revolving these matters, while she undressed, it suddenly struck her as not unlikely that she might that morning have passed near the very spot of this unfortunate woman's confinement -- might have been within a few paces of the cell in which she languished out her days; for what part of the abbey could be more fitted for the purpose than that which yet bore the traces of monastic division? In the high-arched passage, paved with stone, which already she had trodden with peculiar awe, she well remembered the doors of which the general had given no account. To what might not those doors lead? In support of the plausibility of this conjecture, it further occurred to her that the forbidden gallery, in which lay the apartments of the unfortunate Mrs. Tilney, must be, as certainly as her memory could guide her, exactly over this suspected range of cells, and the staircase by the side of those apartments of which she had caught a transient glimpse, communicating by some secret means with those cells, might well have favoured the barbarous proceedings of her husband. Down that staircase she had perhaps been conveyed in a state of well-prepared insensibility!</p> 
<p>Catherine sometimes started at the boldness of her own surmises, and sometimes hoped or feared that she had gone too far; but they were supported by such appearances as made their dismissal impossible.</p> 
<p>The side of the quadrangle, in which she supposed the guilty scene to be acting, being, according to her belief, just opposite her own, it struck her that, if judiciously watched, some rays of light from the general's lamp might glimmer through the lower windows, as he passed to the prison of his wife; and, twice before she stepped into bed, she stole gently from her room to the corresponding window in the gallery, to see if it appeared; but all abroad was dark, and it must yet be too early. The various ascending noises convinced her that the servants must still be up. Till midnight, she supposed it would be in vain to watch; but then, when the clock had struck twelve, and all was quiet, she would, if not quite appalled by darkness, steal out and look once more. The clock struck twelve -- and Catherine had been half an hour asleep.</p> 
<p>一个钟头过去了，将军还没回来。这其间，他的年轻客人左思右想，对他的人格着实没有个好印象。“拖拖拉住地说到不到，独自一个人逛来逛去，这说明他心神不宁，或者良心不安。”最后他终于出现了。不管他的思绪多么郁闷，他依然能够面带笑容。蒂尔尼小姐多少了解一点她朋友的好奇心理，知道她想看看这座房子，马上重新提起了这件事。出乎凯瑟琳的意料，将军居然我不到还要拖延的任何借口，只是停顿了五分钟，为他们回屋时要好了茶点，然后便准备陪她们去转。</p> 
<p>几个人出发了。将军气派堂堂，步伐威严，虽然十分惹眼，但却打消不了熟读传奇小说的凯瑟琳对他的疑虑。他领头穿过门厅，经过共用客厅和一间形同虚设的前厅，进入一音庄严宏大、陈设华丽的大屋子。这是正式客厅，只用来接待要人贵客。客厅十分宏伟，十分富丽，十分迷人。凯瑟琳只能说这么几句话，因为她给搞得眼花缭乱，几乎连缎子的颜色都分辨不清。一切细致入微的赞语，一切意味深长的赞语，全都出自将军之口。无论哪个房间，家具的豪华精致对凯瑟琳来说是微不足道的，她不稀罕晚于十五世纪的家具。将军满足了自己的好奇心，仔仔细细地查看了每一件熟悉的装饰。接着，大家来到了书房。这间屋子也同样豪华，里面摆着收集的图书，谦恭的人见了兴许会感到自豪呢。凯瑟琳带着比先前更加真挚的感情，听着，赞美着，惊叹着，尽量这座知识宝库里多吸取些知识，浏览了半个书架的书名，然后便准备走了。但是她想的那种套间并没出现。这座楼房虽然很大，但她已经看过了大半。她听说，她看过的六七间屋子，加上厨房，环绕着院子的三面，可她简直无法相信，无法消除心中的怀疑，总觉得还有不少密室。然而，使她感到欣慰的是，他们要回到几间共用的屋子，穿过几间不很显要的房间，一间间的都对着院子，院里偶尔有几条错综曲折的通道，把几侧连结起来。途中，她更为欣慰地听说，她脚踩着的地方从前是修道院的回廊，主人把一些密室的陈迹指给她看，她还见到几扇门，主人既没打开，也没向她解说。她接连走进弹子房和将军的私室，搞不清它们之间是怎么沟通的，离开时还转错了方向。最后穿过一间昏暗的小屋，这是亨利的私室，屋里乱七八糟地堆放着他的书籍、猎枪和大衣。</p> 
<p>餐厅已经见过了，而且每到五点钟都要看一次。可是将军为了让莫兰小姐知道得更清楚，还兴致勃勃地用脚步量了量它的长度，殊不知凯瑟琳对此既不怀疑，也不感兴趣。他们抄近道来到了厨房。那是修道院的老厨房，既有昔日的厚墙和薰烟，又有现代化的炉灶和烤箱。将军的修缮技能没有在这里虚晃过去。在这个厨师的广阔天地里，他采用了一切现代化设备，来改善厨师的劳动条件。凡是别人无能为力的地方，他往往凭着自己的天资，把事情解决得尽善尽美。他仅只此处的贡献，就可确保他在这座修道院的恩主之中，永远成为佼佼者。</p> 
<p>寺院的全部古迹到这厨房的四壁便终止了。四方院的第四面房子因为濒于坍塌，早被将军的父亲拆除了，盖起了现在这房屋。一切古色古香的东西到此便绝了迹。新房子不仅仅是新，而且还要标榜其新。因为本来只打算用作下房，后面又圈着马厩，也就没考虑建筑形式的一体化。凯瑟琳真要大发雷霆了，有人仅仅为了节省家庭开支，居然毁掉了本该成为全寺最有价值的古迹。假若将军许可的话，她宁肯不到这惨遭破坏的地方来散步，免得心里感到痛苦。但是，要说将军有虚荣心的话，那就表现在他对下房的安排上。他相信，在莫兰小姐这种人的心目中，能看看那些足以减轻下人劳动强度的舒适便利设施，总会感到十分高兴的，因此他尽可领着她往前走，用不着向她表示歉意。他们把所有的设施略微看了一下，出乎凯瑟琳的意料，这些设施是那样众多，那样方便，给她留下了深刻的印象。在富勒顿，有几个不成样子的食品柜和一个不舒适的洗涤槽，也就解决问题了。可在这里，这一切却在儿间恰当的屋子里进行既方便又宽敞。仆人川流不息，人数之众，与下房之多同样使她感到惊讶。几个人无论走到哪里，都有穿着木跟套鞋的女仆停下来施礼，穿着便服的男仆则偷偷溜走。然而，这是一座寺院啊！如此安排家务，这同她在书里看到的差异之大，真是无法形容：书里的寺院和城堡虽说无疑比诺桑觉寺来得还大，但是房内的一切杂活至多由两个女佣来做，她们怎么能做得完，这常使艾伦太太感到惊愕。可当凯瑟琳发现这里需要这么多人，她自已又感到惊愕起来。</p> 
<p>他们回到门厅，以便好登上主楼梯，让客人瞧瞧它那精美的木质和富丽的雕饰。到了楼探顶，没向凯瑟琳卧房所在的走廊走去，而是转了个相反方向，很快进入另一条走廊。这条走廊的格局踉那一条的一样，只是更长更宽。她在这里接连看了三间大卧房，连同各自的化妆室，一间间陈设得极其完备，极其华丽。但凡金钱和情趣能给住房带来的舒适和雅致，这里是应有尽有。因为都是近五年内装饰起来的。一般人喜欢的东西倒完备无缺，凯瑟琳感兴趣的东西却一无所有。看完最后一个卧房时，将军随便列举了几位不时光临的名人，然后喜笑颜开地转向凯瑟琳，大胆地希望。今后最早来这里作客的人里，能有“富勒顿的朋友”。凯瑟琳不由得受宠若惊，觉得自己瞧不起对她如此亲切，对她全家如此客气的一个人深感遗憾。</p> 
<p>走廊的尽头是一扇折门，蒂尔尼小姐上前一下打开门，走了进去，里面又是一条长长的走廊，她似乎刚想闯进左边的第一扇门，不料将军走上前来，急忙把她叫住(凯瑟琳觉得他好像很恼怒)，问她要去哪里？还有什么要看的？凡是值得看的，莫兰小姐不是都看过了吗？前前后后跑了半天，她不觉得她的朋友可能想吃点点心吗？蒂尔尼小姐当即缩了回来，沉甸甸的折门又关上了。</p> 
<p>但是说时迟那时快，痛心的凯瑟琳赶在关门的前头，趁机向里面瞥了一眼，见到一条狭窄的过道上开着无数的门，影影绰绰地还见到一条螺旋楼梯，相信自己终于来到了值得一看的地方了。她心灰意懒地顺着走廊往回走时，觉得要是许可的话，她宁可看看房子这端，也不愿意参观那富丽堂皇的其他部分。”将军分明是不想让她去看，这就越发激起了她的好奇心。这里一定隐藏着什么东西。她的想象最近虽然越了一两次轨，但是这回绝对错不了。这里到底隐藏着什么呢？两人跟着将军下楼时，蒂尔尼小姐见将军离着她们比较远，便趁机说道：“我本想带你去我母亲的房里，也就是她临终时呆的那间——”这句话虽然简短，凯瑟琳听了都觉得意味深长。难怪将军不敢去看那间房子里的东西。十有八九，自从那可怕的事情解脱了他妻子的痛苦，让他随良心的责备以来，他就从来没有进过那间屋子。</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳抓住下一次和埃丽诺单独在一起的机会，冒昧地表示希望能允许她看看那间屋子，以及房子那边的其余地方。埃丽诺答应方便时带她去。凯瑟琳明白她的意思：要瞅准将军不在家时，才能走进那间屋子。“我想那屋子还保持着原样吧？”她带着伤感的语调说道。</p> 
<p>“是的，完全是原样。”</p> 
<p>“你母亲去世多久了？”</p> 
<p>“九年了。”凯瑟琳知道：一个受折磨的妻子，一般要在死后许多年，她的屋子才能收拾好；与一般情况相比，九年的时间还不算长。</p> 
<p>“很想，你守着她直到临终吧？”</p> 
<p>“不，”蒂尔尼小姐叹了口气说：“不幸得很，我当时不在家母亲的病来得突然、短暂。还没等我到家，一切都完了。”</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳听了这话，心里自然而然地冒出一些可怕的联想，不禁感到毛骨悚然。这可能吗？亨利的父亲难道会----？然而多少先例证明，即使最坏的猜疑都是有道理的。晚上，凯瑟琳和她的朋友一起做活计，见着将军在客厅里迟缓地踱步，垂着眼，锁着眉，整整沉思了一个钟头。这时凯瑟琳感到，她决不会冤枉他。这简直是蒙透尼的神气的姿态！一个尚未完全丧尽人性的人，一想起过去的罪恶情景不免胆战心惊，还有什么比这能表明其阴郁的心理的！不幸的人儿！凯瑟琳因为心情焦虑，便一而再再而三地把目光投向将军，以至引起了蒂尔尼小姐的注意。“我父亲，”她小声说道。“经常这样在屋里走来走去，这没有什么奇怪的。”</p> 
<p>“这就更加不妙！”凯瑟琳心想：他这不合时宜的踱步，与他早晨不合时宜的奇怪散步是一致的，决不是好征兆。</p> 
<p>晚上过得很枯燥，似乎也很漫长，这使凯瑟琳特别认识到亨利在他们之中的重要性。后来，当她可以走时，她感到由衷的高兴，尽管她无意中看到是将军使眼色，让他女儿去拉铃的的。不过，男管家刚想给主人点蜡烛，将军却拦住了他。原来，他还不准备马上去休息。“我要看完许多小册子，”他对凯瑟琳说道，然后才能睡觉。也许在你入睡之后，我还要花几个钟头来研究国家大事。我们两人还有比这更恰当的分工吗？我的眼睛为了别人的利益都快累瞎了，可你的眼睛却在休息，休息好了好淘气。”</p> 
<p>但是，他说他要办公也好，那绝妙的恭维也罢，都动摇不了凯瑟琳心中的念头，她认为将军长时间地推迟正常的睡眠，一定另有一个大相径庭的动机。家人人睡之后，让一些无聊的小册子搅得几个钟头不能安歇，这是不大可能的。这里面一定有个更加深奥的原故：他准有什么事情，非要等全家人人睡之后才能去干。</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳接着必然会得出这样的结论：蒂尔尼太太很可能还活着，不知什么缘故给关了起来，每天晚上从她无情无义的丈夫手里，接过一点残羹粗饭。这个念头虽则骇人听闻，但至少要比不义加速的死亡来得好些，因为照自然趋势来说，她不久定会得到释放。听说她当时是突然得病，她女儿又不在身边，很可能另外两个孩子也不在，这些情况都有助于说明，她被监禁的推测可能是对的。监禁的起因—一或许是拈酸吃醋，或许是无端的残忍——还有待澄清。</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳一边脱衣一边寻思这些问题时，突然想到她早上说不定就从囚禁那不幸女人的地方走过，距离她在里面残喘度日的囚室不过几步远，因为这里还保留着修道院建筑的痕迹，诺桑觉寺还有哪里比这儿更适合监禁人呢？再说那条用石头铺砌的拱顶走廊，她已经心惊胆战地在里面走了一遭，对那一扇扇门还记忆犹新，尽管将军没作解释。这一扇扇门，哪儿不能通呢？为了证明她的推测下无道理，她还进而想到：蒂尔尼夫人住房所在的那段走廊被列为了禁区，据她记忆断定，这段走廊应该恰好位于那排可疑的密室上方。那些房间旁边的那节楼梯，凯瑟琳曾经倏忽地瞥过一眼，一定有密道与下面的密室沟通，可能为蒂尔尼将军的残暴行径提供了方便。蒂尔尼夫人可能是被蓄意搞昏以后，给抬下楼的。</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳有时对自己的大胆推测感到吃惊，有时她希望自己想得太过火，同时又怕太过火。但是从表面来看，这些推测又是那样合乎情理，她又打消不了。</p> 
<p>她相信，将军的罪恶活动发生在四方院的那边，恰好与她这边迎面相对。因此她意识到：如果仔细观察，将军去囚室见他妻子时，他的灯光也许会从楼下窗口透出来。上床之前，她曾两次悄悄溜出房间，来到走廊相应的窗口，瞧瞧有没有灯光。可是外面一片黑暗，想必还为时过早。而且从一阵阵上楼梯的声音来看，她相信佣人一定还没睡觉。午夜之前，她料想看不到什么名堂，但是到午夜，等时钟敲了十二点，万籁俱寂的时候，如果不让黑暗吓破胆的话，倒还想溜出去再看一次。但是，时钟打十二点的时候，凯瑟琳已经睡着了半个钟头。</p>
