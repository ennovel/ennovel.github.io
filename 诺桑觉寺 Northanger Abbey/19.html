The result of her observations was not agreeable. Isabella seemed an altered creature. When she saw her, indeed, surrounded only by their immediate friends in Edgar's Buildings or Pulteney Street, her change of manners was so trifling that, had it gone no farther, it might have passed unnoticed. A something of languid indifference, or of that boasted absence of mind which Catherine had never heard of before, would occasionally come across her; but had nothing worse appeared, that might only have spread a new grace and inspired a warmer interest. But when Catherine saw her in public, admitting Captain Tilney's attentions as readily as they were offered, and allowing him almost an equal share with James in her notice and smiles, the alteration became too positive to be passed over. What could be meant by such unsteady conduct, what her friend could be at, was beyond her comprehension. Isabella could not be aware of the pain she was inflicting; but it was a degree of wilful thoughtlessness which Catherine could not but resent. James was the sufferer. She saw him grave and uneasy; and however careless of his present comfort the woman might be who had given him her heart, to her it was always an object. For poor Captain Tilney too she was greatly concerned. Though his looks did not please her, his name was a passport to her goodwill, and she thought with sincere compassion of his approaching disappointment; for, in spite of what she had believed herself to overhear in the pump-room, his behaviour was so incompatible with a knowledge of Isabella's engagement that she could not, upon reflection, imagine him aware of it. He might be jealous of her brother as a rival, but if more had seemed implied, the fault must have been in her misapprehension. She wished, by a gentle remonstrance, to remind Isabella of her situation, and make her aware of this double unkindness; but for remonstrance, either opportunity or comprehension was always against her. If able to suggest a hint, Isabella could never understand it. In this distress, the intended departure of the Tilney family became her chief consolation; their journey into Gloucestershire was to take place within a few days, and Captain Tilney's removal would at least restore peace to every heart but his own. But Captain Tilney had at present no intention of removing; he was not to be of the party to Northanger; he was to continue at Bath. When Catherine knew this, her resolution was directly made. She spoke to Henry Tilney on the subject, regretting his brother's evident partiality for Miss Thorpe, and entreating him to make known her prior engagement.</p> 
<p>"My brother does know it," was Henry's answer.</p> 
<p>"Does he? Then why does he stay here?"</p> 
<p>He made no reply, and was beginning to talk of something else; but she eagerly continued, "Why do not you persuade him to go away? The longer he stays, the worse it will be for him at last. Pray advise him for his own sake, and for everybody's sake, to leave Bath directly. Absence will in time make him comfortable again; but he can have no hope here, and it is only staying to be miserable."</p> 
<p>Henry smiled and said, "I am sure my brother would not wish to do that."</p> 
<p>"Then you will persuade him to go away?"</p> 
<p>"Persuasion is not at command; but pardon me, if I cannot even endeavour to persuade him. I have myself told him that Miss Thorpe is engaged. He knows what he is about, and must be his own master."</p> 
<p>"No, he does not know what he is about," cried Catherine; "he does not know the pain he is giving my brother. Not that James has ever told me so, but I am sure he is very uncomfortable."</p> 
<p>"And are you sure it is my brother's doing?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, very sure."</p> 
<p>"Is it my brother's attentions to Miss Thorpe, or Miss Thorpe's admission of them, that gives the pain?"</p> 
<p>"Is not it the same thing?"</p> 
<p>"I think Mr. Morland would acknowledge a difference. No man is offended by another man's admiration of the woman he loves; it is the woman only who can make it a torment."</p> 
<p>Catherine blushed for her friend, and said, "Isabella is wrong. But I am sure she cannot mean to torment, for she is very much attached to my brother. She has been in love with him ever since they first met, and while my father's consent was uncertain, she fretted herself almost into a fever. You know she must be attached to him."</p> 
<p>"I understand: she is in love with James, and flirts with Frederick."</p> 
<p>"Oh! no, not flirts. A woman in love with one man cannot flirt with another."</p> 
<p>"It is probable that she will neither love so well, nor flirt so well, as she might do either singly. The gentlemen must each give up a little."</p> 
<p>After a short pause, Catherine resumed with, "Then you do not believe Isabella so very much attached to my brother?"</p> 
<p>"I can have no opinion on that subject."</p> 
<p>"But what can your brother mean? If he knows her engagement, what can he mean by his behaviour?"</p> 
<p>"You are a very close questioner."</p> 
<p>"Am I? I only ask what I want to be told."</p> 
<p>"But do you only ask what I can be expected to tell?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, I think so; for you must know your brother's heart."</p> 
<p>"My brother's heart, as you term it, on the present occasion, I assure you I can only guess at."</p> 
<p>"Well?"</p> 
<p>"Well! Nay, if it is to be guesswork, let us all guess for ourselves. To be guided by second-hand conjecture is pitiful. The premises are before you. My brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man; he has had about a week's acquaintance with your friend, and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her."</p> 
<p>"Well," said Catherine, after some moments' consideration, "you may be able to guess at your brother's intentions from all this; but I am sure I cannot. But is not your father uncomfortable about it? Does not he want Captain Tilney to go away? Sure, if your father were to speak to him, he would go."</p> 
<p>"My dear Miss Morland," said Henry, "in this amiable solicitude for your brother's comfort, may you not be a little mistaken? Are you not carried a little too far? Would he thank you, either on his own account or Miss Thorpe's, for supposing that her affection, or at least her good behaviour, is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain Tilney? Is he safe only in solitude? Or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else? He cannot think this -- and you may be sure that he would not have you think it. I will not say, 'Do not be uneasy,' because I know that you are so, at this moment; but be as little uneasy as you can. You have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend; depend upon it, therefore, that real jealousy never can exist between them; depend upon it that no disagreement between them can be of any duration. Their hearts are open to each other, as neither heart can be to you; they know exactly what is required and what can be borne; and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant."</p> 
<p>Perceiving her still to look doubtful and grave, he added, "Though Frederick does not leave Bath with us, he will probably remain but a very short time, perhaps only a few days behind us. His leave of absence will soon expire, and he must return to his regiment. And what will then be their acquaintance? The mess-room will drink Isabella Thorpe for a fortnight, and she will laugh with your brother over poor Tilney's passion for a month."</p> 
<p>Catherine would contend no longer against comfort. She had resisted its approaches during the whole length of a speech, but it now carried her captive. Henry Tilney must know best. She blamed herself for the extent of her fears, and resolved never to think so seriously on the subject again.</p> 
<p>Her resolution was supported by Isabella's behaviour in their parting interview. The Thorpes spent the last evening of Catherine's stay in Pulteney Street, and nothing passed between the lovers to excite her uneasiness, or make her quit them in apprehension. James was in excellent spirits, and Isabella most engagingly placid. Her tenderness for her friend seemed rather the first feeling of her heart; but that at such a moment was allowable; and once she gave her lover a flat contradiction, and once she drew back her hand; but Catherine remembered Henry's instructions, and placed it all to judicious affection. The embraces, tears, and promises of the parting fair ones may be fancied.</p> 
<p>几天过去了，凯瑟琳虽说不敢怀疑她的朋友，但她不得不密切地注视着她。她观察的结果并不令人愉快。伊莎贝拉似乎变成了另外一个人。当她见她仅仅处在埃德加大楼或是普尔蒂尼街那些亲近的朋友中间时，她的仪态变化倒是微乎其微，假如到此为止的话，兴许还不会引起别人的注意。她时不时地有点无精打采，冷冷漠漠的，或者像她自夸的那样有点心不在焉（这是凯瑟琳以前从未听说的）。不过，假若没有出现更糟糕的事情，这点毛病也许只会焕发出一种新的魅力，激起人们更大的兴趣。但是在公共场合，凯瑟琳看见蒂尔尼上尉一献殷勤、她便欣欣然地加以接受，而且对他几乎像对詹姆斯一样注视，一样笑脸相迎。这时她的变化就太明显了，不能不引起别人的注意。这种朝三暮四的举动究竟是什么意思，她的朋友究竟在搞什么鬼，这是凯瑟琳所无法理解的。伊莎贝拉可能认识不到她给别人造成的痛苦，但是对于她的任性轻率，凯瑟琳却不能不感到气愤。詹姆斯是受害者。她见他面色阴沉，心神不定。以前倾心于他的那个女人不管多么不关心他现在的安适，她可随时在关心。她对可怜的蒂尔尼上尉，同样感到十分关切。虽说他长得不讨她喜欢，但是他的姓却赢得了她的好感。她带着真挚的同情，想到蒂尔尼上尉行将面临的失望，因为，她尽管自以为在矿泉厅听到了他们的对话，可是从蒂尔尼上尉的举止来看，他不像是知道伊莎贝拉已经订了婚，因此，凯瑟琳经过前思后想，觉得他不可能知道真情。他也许会跟她哥哥争风吃醋，不过假如这其中还有更多奥妙的话，那恐怕一定是她误解了。她希望通过委婉的规劝，提醒伊莎贝拉认清自己的处境，让她知道这样做对两边都不好。但是，要提出规劝，她总是面临着机会难得和不可理喻的问题。她即使能暗示几句，伊莎贝拉也绝对领会不了。在这烦恼之中，蒂尔尼一家打算离开巴思就成了她很大的慰藉。这一家子几天之内就要动身回格洛斯特郡去了，蒂尔尼上尉一走，至少可以使除他以外的每个人恢复平静，谁想蒂尔尼上尉眼下并不打算离去，而不准备和家人一起回诺桑觉寺，而要继续留在巴思。凯瑟琳得知这一情况之后，立即拿定了主意。她跟亨利·蒂尔尼谈了这件事，对他哥哥分明喜爱索普小姐感到遗憾，恳求他告诉他哥哥，索普小姐早已订婚。</p> 
<p>“我哥哥已经知道这事了。”亨利答道。</p> 
<p>“他知道了？那他为什么还要留在这里？”</p> 
<p>亨利没有作答。他谈起了别的事情，可是凯瑟琳心急地继续说道：“你为什么不劝他走开？他呆的时间越长，最终会对他越糟糕。请你看在他的份上，也看在大家的份上，劝他马上离开巴思。离开之后，他到时会重新感到愉快的。他在这里是没有希望的，呆下去只会自寻烦恼。”</p> 
<p>亨利笑笑说：“我哥哥当然也不愿意那样干。”</p> 
<p>“那你要劝他离开啦。”</p> 
<p>“劝说我是办不到的。如果我连劝都不去劝他，那也要请你原谅。我曾亲口对他说过，索普小姐已经订婚。他知道自己在干什么，这事只能由他自己做主。”</p> 
<p>“不，他不知道他在干什么，”凯瑟琳大声嚷道，“他不知道他给我哥哥带来了痛苦。詹姆斯并没跟我这样说过，不过我敢肯定他很痛苦。”’。</p> 
<p>“你肯定这是我哥哥的过错？”</p> 
<p>“是的，十分肯定。”</p> 
<p>“究竟是因为我哥哥献了殷勤、还是因为索普小姐接受了殷勤。才引起这般痛苦的？”</p> 
<p>“这难道不是一回事吗？”</p> 
<p>“我想莫兰先生会承认这是有区别的。男人谁也不会因为有人爱慕自己心爱的女人而感到恼火，只有女人才能制造出痛苦。”</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳为自己的朋友感到脸红，说道：“伊莎贝拉是有错。可我相信她决不是有意制造痛苦，因为她十分疼爱我哥哥。她自从第一次见到我哥哥，一直在爱着他。当我父亲是否同意还捉摸不定的时候，她简直要急病了。你知道她一定很爱詹姆斯。”</p> 
<p>“我知道她在与詹姆斯恋爱，还在与弗雷德里克调情。”</p> 
<p>“哦，不，不是调情！一个女人爱上一个男人，不可能再与别人调情。”</p> 
<p>“也许，她无论是恋爱．还是调情都不会像单打一时来得圆满。两位先生都得作点牺牲。”</p> 
<p>稍停了一会，凯瑟琳继续说道。“这么说，你不相信伊莎贝拉很爱我哥哥啦？”</p> 
<p>“这我可不敢说。”</p> 
<p>“可你哥哥是什么意思？他要是知道伊莎贝拉已经订了婚，他这般举动能是什么意思呢？”</p> 
<p>“你还真能够刨根问底的。” “是吗？我只是问我想知道的事情。”</p> 
<p>“可你回的只是你认为我能回答的问题吗？”</p> 
<p>“是的，我想是这样，因为你一定了解你哥哥的心。”</p> 
<p>“老实对你说吧，眼下这当儿，我对我哥哥的心(这是你的说法)，只能猜测而已。”</p> 
<p>“怎么样？”</p> 
<p>“怎么样！唔，如果是猜测的话，还是让我们各猜各的吧。受别人猜测的左右是可怜的。这些前提全摆在你的面前。我哥哥是个很活泼的、有时也许很轻率的年轻人，他和你的朋友大约结交了一个星期，知道她订婚的时间几乎同认识她的时间一样长。”</p> 
<p>“是呀，”凯瑟琳略思片刻，说道，“你也许能从这一切里推测出你哥哥用心何在，我可办不到。难道你父亲不为此感到不安吗？难道他不想让蒂尔尼上尉离开巴思吗？当然，要是你父亲来劝说他，他是会走的。”</p> 
<p>“亲爱的莫兰小姐，”亨利说道，“你如此关切地为你哥哥的安适担忧，是不是也会出点差错呢？你是不是作得太过火了？你认为索普小姐只有在见不到蒂尔尼上尉踪影的情况下，才能保证对你哥哥一片钟情，或者至少保证行为检点，你哥哥是否会为自己或索普小姐感谢你作出这样的设想呢？你哥哥是否只在与世隔绝的情况下才是保险的？或者说，索普小姐是否只在不受别人诱惑的情况下，才对你哥哥忠贞不渝？他不可能这样想，而且你可以相信，他也不会让你这样想。我不想说；‘请不要担忧，’因为我知道你现在正在担忧，不过请你尽量少担忧。你相信你哥哥与你的朋友是相慕相爱的，因此请你放心，他们之间决不会当真去争风吃醋。放心吧，他们之间的不和是短暂的。他们的心是息息相通的，对你就不可能。他们完全知道各自有什么要求，能容忍到什么限度。你尽管相信，他们开玩笑决不会开到不愉快的地步。”</p> 
<p>他发现凯瑟琳依然将信将疑地板着脸，便进而说道：“弗雷德里克虽然不和我们一道离开巴思，但他可能只呆很短一段时间，也许只比我们晚走几天。他的假期马上就要结束，他必须回到部队。那时候，他们的友谊会怎么样呢？食堂里的军官们会为伊莎贝拉·索普干上两个星期的杯，伊莎贝拉会和你哥哥一起，对蒂尔尼这个可怜虫的一片痴情笑上一个月。”</p> 
<p>凯瑟琳不再放心不下了。整整一席话，她心里都是忐忑不安的，现在终于放下了心。亨利·蒂尔尼一定知道得最清楚。她责怪自己吓成那个样子，决心不再把这件事看得太严重。</p> 
<p>临别一面，伊莎贝拉的举动进一步坚定了凯瑟琳的决心。凯瑟琳临行前一天的晚上，索普家的人是在普尔蒂尼街度过的，两位情人之间没有发生什么事引起凯瑟琳的焦灼不安，或者使她忧心仲仲地离开他们。詹姆斯喜气洋洋的，伊莎贝拉心平气和，极其迷人。看来，她对朋友的依依深情在她心中是占据第一位的。不过值此时刻这是可以容许的。一次，她断然把她的情人抢白了一番。还有一次，她抽回了自己的手。不过凯瑟琳铭记着亨利的教诲，把这一切归诸于审慎多情。分手时，两位美貌小姐如何拥抱，流泪、许愿，读者自己也想象得出。</p>
