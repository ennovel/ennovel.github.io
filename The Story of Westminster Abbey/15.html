And what more fitting than that he who has been so justly named the "poet of the dawn, the finder of our fair language, the father of English poetry," should rest, when his life's work was ended, near to those others with whose names our early history is studded?
<br> 
<br> He was born in London about the year 1335, the son of a merchant vintner, and throughout his life London was to him "a city very deare and sweete." He was well educated, though where we know not, in classics, divinity, astronomy, philosophy, and chemistry, and naturally spoke French fluently, as its use was general. From his boyhood he loved reading only less than he loved nature.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On bok?s for to rede, I me delyte,
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Save certeynly whan that the moneth of May
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is comen, and that I here the foul?s synge,
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that the flour?s gynnen for to sprynge,
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Farwel my boke and my devoc?oun."
<br> 
<br> And almost equally, too, he loved to see life, to travel in foreign countries, to study, in a kindly sympathetic spirit, human nature in all its forms, neither criticising harshly nor condemning impatiently, but just observing and understanding.
<br> 
<br> Those early years of his life marked a great epoch in England, for Edward III. made the land ring with the fame of his victories at Crecy and Poitiers; the valour of his knights and soldiers; the fair and famous deeds done in the name of that chivalry which was then at its height; and young Chaucer seems to have caught the reflection of all that enthusiasm and vigour. He was the child of his age, but he heard its sobs as well as its laughter, the rattling chains of its slaves as well as the clanking steel and the trumpet notes of its armed men. The Black Death and the revolt of the downtrodden peasants made a grim setting to the picture of heart-stirring triumphs in the battle-field, and Chaucer saw both the setting and the picture.
<br> 
<br> When he was about twenty he became attached to the court in a humble capacity, but his pleasant manners and conversation, his cheerfulness and his straightforward simplicity, soon won him promotion, so that he was made first gentleman-in-waiting, then esquire to King Edward, who more than once spoke of him as his "beloved valet," and who trusted him well enough to send him on many important missions to foreign countries as his messenger. But Chaucer's greatest and unchanging ally at court was the king's brother, John of Gaunt. For more than forty years their friendship remained unbroken through many ups and downs of fortune.
<br> 
<br> In 1369 John of Gaunt's first wife, Blanche, died, young, beautiful, and beloved. Chaucer had already shown his power of writing excellent verse by a translation he had made from a celebrated French poem "Le Roman de la Rose," so it was only natural that John of Gaunt should turn to him when in the sorrow of the moment he desired the goodness and charm of his lady to be commemorated. The result was the "Book of the Duchess," a story told as an allegory, for Chaucer was under the spell of French literature, which revelled in allegory. In this book he tells how one May morning, the sun shining in at his windows, and the sound of the "sweete foule's carolling," drew him forth into the forest, where, led thereto by a faithful dog, he found a knight dressed in black, mourning all in a quiet spot among the mighty trees. His hands drooped, his face was pale, he could not be consoled. But finding the poet a sympathetic listener, he told him the story of his sorrow.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My lady bright
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which I heve loved with all my might,
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is from me deed, and is agone ...
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was so fair, so fresh, so free."
<br> 
<br> Years of happiness he had spent with her, this sweet lady, who yet was so strong and helpful.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I hed wrong and she the right,
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wolde alwey so good?ly
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgive me so débónnairly.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In alle my youth, in alle chance,
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She took me in her governaunce.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therewith she was alwày so trewe,
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our joys was ever y-liche newe."
<br> 
<br> And now she was dead. Words of comfort were of no avail. The poet could no longer intrude on grief so overwhelming. He could only silently sympathise, and then leave the mourning knight alone in his sorrow, with the parting words
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that your los? By God, hit is routhe."
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<br> 
<br> Soon after he had written this touching tribute to the memory of a woman who had been his ideal of goodness and graciousness, Chaucer was sent on a mission to Genoa and Florence, a journey which left its influence upon him in a very marked manner, as he made the acquaintance of Francis Petrarch, the Italian poet, and through him he learned to know the works of Dante and the delightful stories of Boccaccio. A new world was opened out to him, and eagerly he wandered through it, eyes and mind open to every fresh vision that unfolded itself before him. From this time forward his works were tinged with Italian influence, and thereby became much the richer. For he lost none of his own sturdy individuality and fresh, pure style; he only added to this more warmth, more colouring, more romance.
<br> 
<br> On his return to England he was made Comptroller of the Customs of the Port of London, on the understanding that he did all the accounts himself, so important was it that this post should be filled by a man who was both shrewd and honest; and in addition to this both the king and John of Gaunt granted him certain allowances and privileges, so that in worldly affairs he prospered. Good fortune, however, did not cause him to become idle, and his poems followed each other in quick succession. There was the "Assembly of Fowles," of course an allegory, and written probably to celebrate the betrothal of young King Richard to the Princess Anne of Bohemia.
<br> 
<br> "Troilus and Cresside" was a much deeper poem, full of sadness, and Chaucer himself called it his "little Tragedie," adding the hope that one day God might send it to him to "write some Comedie." It is in this work that he refers to the great difficulty with which he, in common with the other writers of his day, had to contend—the unsettled state of the language. The struggle as to whether the French or English tongue should prevail had been a fierce one, but it was now in its last throes. Chaucer, through his works, helped more than any one else to develop our language as it is to-day, and strenuously avoided those "owre curyrows termes which could not be understood of comyn people, and which in every shire varied." But his own words show the difficulties which beset him.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And for there is so great diversité
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In English, and in writing of our tong,
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So pray I God that none miswrite thee
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or thee mismetre for default of tong,
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And red whereso thou be, or elles song,
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That thou be understood, God I beseech."
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<br> 
<br> And it is just because he wrote to be understood that the charm of Chaucer's style remains for ever fresh and entrancing.
<br> 
<br> In his "House of Fame" he had free scope for his pleasant wit, especially when he tells of all he saw and heard in the "House of Rumour," whither came shipmen, pilgrims, pardoners, couriers, and their like, each bringing scraps of news, which, whether true or false, were passed on, growing like a rolling snowball. He set fame at its true value, and for himself only desires that in life he might be able to "study and rite alway," while for the rest—
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It suffyceth me, as I were dedd,
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That no wight have my name in honde,
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wot myself best how I stonde."
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<br> 
<br> The "Legend of Good Women" was written in praise of all those maidens and wives who loved truly and unchangingly.
<br> 
<br> Hitherto Chaucer, whose married life was not an altogether happy one, had sung but little of love in its highest, purest form. But here, in a prologue sparkling and radiant as the morning he describes, he tells us how he went out to greet the daisy, the flower he loved, and would ever love anew till his heart did die.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kneeling alway, til it uncloséd was
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the swet?, soft?, swot? gras
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was with flour?s swote embroidered all.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<br> 
<br> In his dream there came to him the God of Love, with his queen, Alcestis, who, daisy-like, was clad in royal habits green—
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A fret of golde she hedde next her heer,
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And upon that a white courone she beer."
<br> 
<br> She it was who made him swear that from henceforth he would "poetize of wommen trewe in lovying," "speke wel of love," and so make a glorious legend.
<br> 
<br> Chaucer had intended writing at least nineteen stories on the lines decreed by Alcestis, but his days of prosperity had come to an end for the time being, with the exile of John of Gaunt, and he became so poor after his dismissal from the Customs, that he had to raise money on his pension. And so the legend seems to have been laid aside.
<br> 
<br> When Henry of Lancaster became king five years later, he doubled the pension, remembering how his father, just dead, had loved the poet; and so the cloud, which had been heavy enough while it lasted, passed away. But it is to those dark days that we owe the greatest of all Chaucer's work—his "Canterbury Tales"—work, it must be remembered, which rings and re-rings with cheerfulness, courage, sympathy, and kindliness. We know so little of Chaucer as a man but this one fact stands out, that he never allowed his own troubles or anxieties, or even his pressing poverty, to over-cloud his heart or his mind. For him the sun shone always, though he saw it not, and because of that sunshine no trace of bitterness or harshness is to be found in his work.
<br> 
<br> In the prologue to the "Tales" Chaucer explains his plot in the most natural and personal way. One day in the spring, he says, he was waiting at the Tabard Inn, to rest before continuing a pilgrimage he had set out to make to Canterbury, when twenty-nine other pilgrims, all bound for the same destination, arrived. He soon made friends with them, and, finding their company very entertaining, arranged to join this party. Then came the proposal that each one should tell two tales to enliven the journey; a good supper at the end to be the reward of the pilgrim whose story found most favour. The jovial host of the inn decided to join them, and one morning in early spring the procession set out. What a motley crowd they were! Yet Chaucer, with his happy knack of describing people just as they appeared, has made them all so real to us, that it is easy to picture each one of them, and in so doing to get a vivid glimpse of the men and women whom the poet was accustomed to meet every day of his life. But for Chaucer we should know next to nothing about the people of his day. First came the knight, who "lovede chyvalrye," who had ridden far afield in his master's wars; a great soldier, but tender as a woman, "a verrey parfyte gentil knight." With him was his son, acting as his squire, great of strength, able to make brave songs, and to sit well his horse, handsomely dressed, yet in his manners "curteys, lowly, and servysable." His attendant was a yeoman, sunburnt and sturdy, who carried the sheaf of arrows, which he could dress right yeomanly. It seems likely that for a short while Chaucer served as a soldier in France, and if so, how familiar these three must have been to him. Then came the prioress, very "pleasant and semely," adopting court manners, and impressing every one with the idea that she was so compassionate and charitable that even to see a mouse in a trap made her weep. She had her own attendant nuns and priests. The monk was only interested in riding, but the friar, who was licensed to hear confessions, raise money, and perform the offices of the Church in a certain district, was merry, the good friend of all rich women, and reported to "hear confession very sweetly," being easy with the penances he ordered. Sometimes he lisped, "to make his English sweet upon the tongue," and when he sang to his guitar, "his eyes shone like stars on a frosty night." The merchant sat high on his horse, and talked loudly of his increased wealth, a great contrast to the poor clerk of Oxford, who looked hollow, wore a threadbare cloak, and had not been worldly enough to get a benefice. The sergeant-at-law, the landholder, the haberdasher, carpenter, weaver, dyer, tapestry-maker, the cook, the sailor, and the doctor, all had their special characteristics, but of these there is not space to speak. The wife of Bath had a bold face and wore bright clothes; had buried five husbands, all of whom she had ruled, and was quite willing to try a sixth. The poor parson, who was "a shepherd holy and vertuous, never despising sinful men, but teaching them the law of Christ, which he faithfully followed," was, I think, the pilgrim whom Chaucer most reverenced. The religion of the monks and friars revolted him, but those poor priests, leading their simple lives of work and worship, were to his eyes in very truth the servants of Christ, who witnessed loyally to their Master, in spite of the contempt with which their very poverty caused them to be treated. His brother, the ploughman, was in his way as good a man as the priest, for he was a true and honest labourer, who lived in charity with all, loved God, and would, for Christ's sake, "thresh, dyke, or delve for the poor widow's hire." The miller; the manciple, who bought the food for an Inn of Court; the reeve or steward; the summoner to the ecclesiastical courts; and the pardoner, with his packets of relics which he always sold successfully, made up the party; and all having agreed to the host's proposals as to the tales to be told, they drew lots to decide who should begin, the choice falling on the knight, whereat all rejoiced. "Tell us merry things," was the injunction of the host, who was rejoicing in a spell of freedom from his wife's sharp eyes and sharper tongue, and—
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speak ye so plain at this time, we you pray,
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That we may understand? what you say."
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<br> 
<br> Just as Chaucer gave to each pilgrim his own individuality, so in every case he fitted the story to its teller. The knight had a tale of love, romance, and adventure; the clerk chose for heroine the patient, much-suffering Griselda; the prioress told of a child-martyr, and the poor parson, in earnest words, drew their thoughts upward to "that parfyt glorious pilgrimage which each and all must make to celestial Jerusalem." Chaucer did not live to finish all the tales he had planned out. In the year 1399 he had taken on a long lease a house at Westminster, which stood where now is Henry VII.'s chapel, and here he spent the last few months of his life, reading and writing contentedly to the end, in high favour at the Palace hard by, and the centre of a little group who loved and revered him. Probably the poor priest's tale was his last bit of work, and that significantly ends with words concerning the pilgrimage of man to the Heavenly City, "To thilke life He bring us, that bought us with His precious blood. Amen."
<br> 
<br> Chaucer's wife had been dead many years, and of his children we know nothing, except that to his son Lewis he gave an astrolabe, an instrument for taking the height of the stars, and wrote for him a "little treatise" on the subject, in which he craves pardon for his "rude inditing and his superfluity of words," explaining that a child is best taught by simple words and much repetition. But we can never think of Chaucer as alone or solitary in his old age. Rather was the house at Westminster a pleasant haven of rest where he anchored surrounded by his many comrades and friends. So greatly honoured was he, that when he died it was at once decided to bury him in the Abbey. The verses with which I end have been called Chaucer's Creed, and some say he repeated them just before his death. Certain it is that they guided his conduct through life.
<br> 
<br> THE GOOD COUNSEL OF CHAUCER
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flee from the crowd and dwell with truthfulness,
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contented with thy good, though it be small.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Treasure breeds hate and climbing dizziness;
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The world is envious, wealth beguiles us all.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Care not for loftier things than to thee fall,
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Counsel thyself, who counsel'st others' need,
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Truth shall thee deliver without dread.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pain thee not all the crooked to redress,
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trusting to her who turneth as a ball;
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For little meddling wins much easiness.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beware lest thou dost kick against an awl!
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strive not, as doth a clay pot with a wall.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judge thou thyself, who judgest others' deeds,
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Truth shall thee deliver without dread.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All that is sent receive with cheerfulness:
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To wrestle with this world inviteth fall.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is no home, here is but wilderness.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forth! pilgrim, forth! Forth, beast, out of thy stall!
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look up on high, and thank thy God for all!
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cast by ambition, let thy soul thee lead,
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Truth shall thee deliver, without dread.
