<br> 
<br> “Yes,” he said at last, “he was in England a week later than we were, and must have come direct to this spot, passing us somewhere on the way; during the night, probably.”
<br> 
<br> The captain was now standing up, his fists clenched.
<br> 
<br> “What do you propose to do?” inquired the manager.
<br> 
<br> “I should like to know first whether we are here as his guests or his prisoners. We were fools to have accepted his invitation without giving ourselves time to think and consult.”
<br> 
<br> “But, hang it all, captain, he came on us so unexpectedly that there was no time to plan, or even to suspect. He seemed to speak so honestly and straightforwardly, and was so ready with his explanation that even up to a moment ago I believed he was but a blameless tourist, with, eccentric tastes, and the money to indulge them; a craze for big game shooting, like so many of them toffs have, and, of course, that kind of a man is mouching all over the world. You meet them everywhere: South America, Africa, Asia. Of course he’s got us aboard here, and could steam away past your ship, and my settlement, with us two flung down the hold, and helpless, just as I put away that Scotch engineer on the Rajah at Southampton. By Jove, I shouldn’t wonder a bit but that’s what’s in his mind: taking a leaf out of my own book. We would have no chance of self-defense with so many men on board, and our steam launch could not keep within sight of him if this boat has turbine engines. The mines are exploded, and the way is clear.”
<br> 
<br> “Don’t you think your men would give her a shot as she went by?”
<br> 
<br> “Not unless I was there to command them. I’ve left nobody in authority. I wonder what he’s doing so long down below? If we are his guests, he should be here to entertain us.”
<br> 
<br> “He is probably giving his orders,” said the captain gloomily. “We are trapped, my boy. He wouldn’t leave us this long to consult together unless he was sure of us.”
<br> 
<br> “Why hasn’t your mate come up from the launch?”
<br> 
<br> “I told him to stay there until I called him. You see, I had my doubts of this man from the first. If he attempts to lay hands on us, I’ll shout to the mate to cut for it.”
<br> 
<br> “What good could that do?” protested the manager. “The motor boat can overtake our launch even if she were half way to camp.”
<br> 
<br> “Ah, here he comes,” said the captain, as Stran-leigh, debonair and smiling, appeared at the head of the companion way. “I’ll settle the question whether we are prisoners or not within two seconds.”
<br> 
<br> “I hope you’ll excuse me,” began Stranleigh, coming forward, “but you are the first guests I have had the pleasure of receiving aboard since I left England, and I wish my to do his best, so I took the liberty of giving special orders for our lunch, and the gong will ring, they tell me, in about a quarter of an hour.”
<br> 
<br> “I am very sorry, Mr. Stranleigh,” replied the captain, “but I am a little anxious about my ship, so I have told my mate to remain in our launch, and I must ask you to excuse me. I cannot remain to lunch.”
<br> 
<br> “Dear me, I’m sorry,” said Stranleigh. “Why is that? What harm can come to your steamer?”
<br> 
<br> “Well, I’ve seen those logs piled up still very close to the brink of the river, and I fear if they tumbled down also, coming end on upon us, they might do the Rajah some damage.”
<br> 
<br> “My men tell me,” Stranleigh reassured him, “that there’s no further danger of more logs getting into the river. Still, they are such fools that they may possibly be mistaken, and I quite share and sympathize with your anxiety. By the way, did any of the other logs damage your boat?”
<br> 
<br> “That I don’t know yet. Some of them certainly struck her.”
<br> 
<br> “Then, captain, you must let me pay for whatever damage has been done; yes, and overpay, because, after all, I am the man responsible. Of course, you see, when we came up the river, there was no ship there, and no sign of any settlement. Still, that does not excuse my not having kept a better outlook. If the timber struck the steamer, is it likely the damage will be serious?”
<br> 
<br> “That, of course, I cannot tell without examination,” replied the master of the Rajah.
<br> 
<br> “Well, captain, we come of a sporting race. I’ll give you a hundred pounds here in gold, win or lose. If the damage is a thousand pounds, then you’ve lost. If there’s no damage at all, you’ve won a hundred pounds. Come, captain, what do you say?”
<br> 
<br> “If no damage has been done, Mr. Stranleigh, I don’t want any money from you. Even if the steamer is hurt, I am not sure I should have a valid claim against you. After all, the affair was an accident.”
<br> 
<br> “Are you satisfied to give me a quit claim for a hundred pounds, cash down?”
<br> 
<br> “I’ll be quite satisfied if you excuse me from attending luncheon, and allow me to go back to my ship.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, certainly, but I’d like you to take the money. Can’t you send the mate, and order him to come back and report to you? It’s a pity to miss a meal, you know.”
<br> 
<br> “I’d feel safer if I went myself.”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, I know exactly how anxious you must feel, and in your place I should do the same. Very well, captain, the only point between us is the hundred pounds or not. To tell the truth, I shall not object to pay full compensation to your owners for what I have done. I imagine, however, so stanch a ship as yours has come to no harm. She lies bow upstream, and the current is not so strong down there as it is up here. The timber, I think, if it struck at all, would glance off, carrying away nothing but a bit of paint; but if you must go, I shall insist on your taking the hundred pounds.”
<br> 
<br> “Take the money, captain,” said the manager, looking up at him with a smile. It was evident that his fears had once more been overcome, but the captain was not so easily cajoled.
<br> 
<br> “Very well,” he said, anxious to end the situation and learn whether he was to be let go or not.
<br> 
<br> “And now, Mr. Frowningshield,” continued Stranleigh, turning to the manager, “let us settle all our financial affairs before lunch, so that we may enjoy our meal without the thought of commercialism at the hoard. You have seen the damage I have caused in your forest, thinking all the while it was my own property. Of course, if you were acting for yourself alone, I am certain I could drive a very easy bargain with you, but you are responsible for the care of these lands to the European syndicate you spoke of, and so, on its behalf, you must be just, rather than generous. At how much coin of the realm do you place my depredations? I know it would cost me a pretty penny if I committed so unforgivable a trespass in England.”
<br> 
<br> “How many trees did you cut down, Mr. Stranleigh?”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, Lord knows! Twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, or a hundred perhaps. That can easily be discovered. We’ll send a man across in the motor boat to count the stumps.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, it isn’t worth while. Would you be content to part with another hundred pounds?”
<br> 
<br> “Done; and you’ve let me off cheaply, Mr. Frowningshield. Just pardon me a moment until I get the money,” and once more he disappeared down below.
<br> 
<br> But all this had not changed in the least the captain’s apprehension.
<br> 
<br> “He’s gone to give the signal,” he said.
<br> 
<br> “Well, you know, captain, I’ve a great regard for you, yet I cannot find it possible to distrust the faith of that young man. He may be a fool, but he’s a gentleman. I don’t believe he would invite three men to a feast, and then imprison them. Now, I’m no fool, but then I’m no gentleman, either, and I’d do it in a minute, if I had an enemy in my power, yet I’m sure he won’t. You’ll see him come up with the money, and you’ll miss a mighty good feed by going off to the Rajah.”
<br> 
<br> “I’m willing to miss the meal, if I once get aboard my ship. I’ll turn her round, and make for the ocean within the hour. You stop here as long as you can; all afternoon, if possible, and give the Rajah a chance to get out of sight before this fellow follows.”
<br> 
<br> “But he can easily overtake you. Still, what could he do if he did? You surely don’t expect him to seize your vessel?”
<br> 
<br> “I don’t know what I expect, but I am afraid of him. I think him quite capable of following me to sea, and capturing the Rajah.”
<br> 
<br> “Nonsense, that would be rank piracy. That would be a hanging matter. It would do him no good to sink you, and what could he do with the Rajah once he had her? There are too many witnesses on board. He wouldn’t dare to sail into any port in the world. But then there’s not the slightest danger of that. He’s no pirate. The days of piracy are past. He may be a fool, but he’s not such a fool as to try a trick like that.”
<br> 
<br> “Will you stop here and give me a chance to get away?”
<br> 
<br> “Willingly.”
<br> 
<br> “Very well, if I once get out of sight there are ten chances to one he can’t catch me before I’m in the Tagus.”
<br> 
<br> Stranleigh reappeared with some rolls of gold done up in paper, and these he divided equally between the captain and Frowningshield. The latter could not resist the temptation of asking a question.
<br> 
<br> “I’ve been looking at this illustrated newspaper, and I notice its date is very recent. You must have made a quick voyage from England, Mr. Stranleigh.”
<br> 
<br> For a moment they had the young man on the hip, but he did not allow the knowledge of this to change the expression of his placid face. He took the journal in his hand, and looked at the date.
<br> 
<br> “Yes, they do these things quickly nowadays, but perhaps not so quickly as one unaccustomed to journalism would imagine. I believe that the illustrated weeklies are dated some time ahead, and I have been told they send forth their foreign editions as far in advance as possible. This, now, could have come from London, through by way of Paris to Lisbon, and reach that city probably several days before the date mentioned on the cover. I must ask the doctor where he bought this copy, whether at Lisbon or Teneriffe.”
<br> 
<br> He flung the Sphere carelessly down on the table as if the matter, after all, was of no moment, and even Frowningshield, who was watching him like a detective of fiction, could distinguish no note of hesitation in his voice, nor catch any glance of annoyance from his eyes.
<br> 
<br> “Well, Mr. Stranleigh,” said the captain, who was not equally successful in keeping an inflection of anxiety from his words, “I am very much obliged to you for your invitation, even though I cannot take advantage of it, so I shall bid you good-by.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, you’re not away yet, captain,” said Stranleigh, with a slight laugh, and the captain drew himself up with a little start of surprise. Stran-leigh walked to the head of the companion way, and said:
<br> 
<br> “Will you be as quick as you can down there?”
<br> 
<br> As his back turned on them, the captain grasped Frowningshield’s wrist.
<br> 
<br> “He’s playing with me like a cat with a mouse,” he whispered.
<br> 
<br> “Nonsense,” replied the other. “Your nerves have gone wrong. He’s as transparent as glass.”
<br> 
<br> Stranleigh turned, followed this time by a steward carrying a hamper,
<br> 
<br> “I don’t like to think of your losing your lunch, captain,” he said, “so I’ve had them put up a basketful for you and the mate on your way to the Rajah. There is in the hamper several bottles of champagne that I think will commend itself to you, or to any other judge of a good vintage, and there is also a box of cigars. If these weeds do not elicit the highest commendation I’ll insist that you bestow on me a better box the next time we meet. So good-by, captain, and good luck to you. May you sail the high seas prosperously and safely. Here’s hoping I shall meet you again when you are not in such a hurry.”
<br> 
<br> Basket and hamper had been placed in the launch, and Stranleigh waved his hand at the captain and mate as their craft steamed out into the current and made for the mining camp.
<br> 
<br> The gong sounded out at last.
<br> 
<br> “Well, Mr. Frowningshield,” said the young man, returning from the side, “if you’re as hungry as I am, you’ll enjoy this meal. Come along.”
<br> 
<br> The manager did enjoy the meal, and they lingered long over the consuming of it, coming up on deck after it was over to indulge in coffee, liquors, and cigars. The manager fell under the charm of the young man’s conversation, and began to revise his first estimate that his host was a fool. He had drunk but sparingly of the generous wine, yet in the glow of contentment which it produced he laughed quietly to himself now and then at the unfounded fears of the captain, which had cause him to run away from so excellent a repast.
<br> 
<br> “If this is a cigar from a similar box to the one you gave the captain, the old man is to be congratulated.”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, it is. The captain, of course, will see civilization long before you do, and so can provide himself with any variety of the weed he fancies; but you, in this out-of-the-world place, are not so fortunate, therefore I must beg of you to accept six boxes in remembrance of the enjoyable time I have spent in your society.”
<br> 
<br> “Why, Mr. Stranleigh, I’m awfully much obliged, and I may tell you at once I am not going to refuse. A man doesn’t get a present like that every year of his life, worse luck.”
<br> 
<br> “Then to make up the average, Mr. Frowning-shield, you must let me add a few cases of our champagne.”
<br> 
<br> “Really, you are most kind. I don’t know how to thank you.”
<br> 
<br> “Don’t attempt it, I beg of you.”
<br> 
<br> A steward approached and presented Stranleigh with a sealed envelope, which, begging the pardon of his guest, he tore open, saying:
<br> 
<br> “I give all my orders in writing, so that there can be no mistake, and I rarely receive verbal reports from any one.”
<br> 
<br> “A good idea,” said Frowningshield.
<br> 
<br> “Yes, it prevents disputes afterwards.”
<br> 
<br> He read to himself the penciled words of the telegrapher who had transcribed a wireless message from the hilltop.
<br> 
<br> “The Rajah is turning round, and is evidently about to depart.”
<br> 
<br> Stranleigh, with a pencil, wrote on the back of the letter the following dispatch to Mackeller.
<br> 
<br> “Report once more if the Rajah actually sails; then take with you anything you don’t want to leave, and come down to the water. The motor boat will be waiting for you. Come aboard at the prow, and get immediately out of sight in the forecastle, for sitting aft with me is the man who kicked you down into the hold, and I don’t wish him to recognize you.”
<br> 
<br> Giving this to the waiting steward, Stranleigh resumed conversation with his guest, who showed no desire to depart. Shortly after came the second message: “The Rajah has sailed. Send motor boat now.”
<br> 
<br> Stranleigh folded up the sheet of paper, and handed it to the steward.
<br> 
<br> “Give that to the captain,” he said, and a few minutes later the purr of the motor boat was heard leaving the ship. The sound aroused Frowningshield.
<br> 
<br> “Are you sending away the motor boat?” he asked. “As our steam launch has not returned, I fear I must depend on you for getting me down to the camp.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, that’s all right,” replied Stranleigh easily. “The boat isn’t going far; just to pick up two of my men who’ve been prospecting in the hills. In fact, this is the end of my trespass, for there is little use in my gazing on a Promised Land that has been promised to somebody else. As for the motor boat, and getting to camp, I can take you there more comfortably than on that little craft. You see, there’s nothing further to keep me here, as I have said, unless I can make terms with your syndicate, and that very likely would not suit my book, because cheapness of land was one of my objects in coming so far. If your syndicate expects to find valuable minerals on this property, they are not likely to sell any of their holdings to me at such a price as I should care to pay, so I think I shall cast off and away, but whether I shall go north or south will depend on circumstances when I get out to sea.”
<br> 
<br> “What, you are not going to sail to-night, are you?” said Frowningshield, sitting up.
<br> 
<br> “Yes, there’s no use in stopping here any longer. Do you happen to know any place along the coast which would be suitable as a colonizing place for Englishmen? I should like it to resemble this as much as possible: hills, a large flow of pure water, free from any fever swamps, and good soil.”
<br> 
<br> “No, Mr. Stranleigh, this is the only portion of Africa I am acquainted with.”
<br> 
<br> “It’s very likely the captain of the Rajah may be able to give me some hints. He has probably knocked around the world a bit, and doubtless has kept his eyes open. I wish I had thought of asking him before he left whether or not he knows this coast. Besides, I would like to learn for certain if I have damaged his ship. It’s a good thing she wasn’t facing the other way, otherwise a log might have wrecked rudder or screw, or both.”
<br> 
<br> “I am afraid,” stammered Frowningshield, “that you won’t see the captain again. He was very anxious to be off, and I rather fancy by this time he’s well out at sea.”
<br> 
<br> “Ah, in that case,” remarked Stranleigh indifferently, “I shall be consoled by the assurance that his steamer is uninjured.”
<br> 
<br> In due time the motor boat returned, and its occupants entered the yacht without being seen by their master’s guest. The motor boat was hoisted on board, and the captain, coming aft, said:
<br> 
<br> “Any further orders, sir?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes. Plymouth, if you please. And, captain, just stop on your way at the camp, which I am informed is on the left-hand bank of the river. Draw up at the landing if there is one; if not, perhaps Mr. Frowningshield’s launch will be waiting for him. There are some packages to go ashore.”
<br> 
<br> The steamer proceeded down the river with just enough speed on to give her steering way. Frowningshield sat very silent, but his host made up with loquacity for the other’s taciturnity. He told entertaining stories, and related odd experiences, and all with a delicate courtesy, as if his guest was the most honored of men, instead of being merely an adventurer and a marauder on a gold quest.
<br> 
<br> The captain drew up expertly at the landing. Nothing was to be seen of the Rajah that so lately had been berthed there. In spite of the fact that they saw their boss stepping ashore, large groups of men had ceased work, and were standing twenty or thirty yards back from the landing, viewing with eyes of wonderment the trim white steamer that had come out of the wilderness. Frowning-shield stepped ashore like a man in a dream, and a couple of stewards placed the cases of champagne and the boxes of cigars on the rock beside him. Lord Stranleigh leaned against the rail, and bade farewell to the manager.
<br> 
<br> “Wouldn’t you like to come on to Plymouth with us?” he said. “Penny all the way. County Council express boat. No stop between Chelsea and London Bridge.”
<br> 
<br> “God knows I wish I could,” said Frowning-shield, with a deep sigh.
<br> 
<br> “Well, at least,” cried Stranleigh cheerfully, “we’ve had one pleasant afternoon, and I’m more than grateful for your company. I hope that you will find valuable minerals on this spot; a second Klondike or Kimberley in either gold or diamonds. Somehow I think you’ll be successful, and so I’ll leave you my best wishes. Good-by, good-by.”
<br> 
<br> The steamer was moving off down the river as Stranleigh waved his hand at the choice gang of ruffians that manned the highest outcrop of the reef.
<br> 
<br> “After all,” he murmured to himself, “they’re Englishmen, poor devils, and we’re all a long way from home!”
<br> 
<br> The manager standing there on the rock suddenly bethought himself, and raised his hat. A cheer broke forth from the outlaws, and they waved aloft tattered caps.
<br> 
<br> “Pull the whistle, captain, with a hip-hip-hip-hurrah,” and the siren sounded across the delta.
<br> 
<br> The manager stood for a long while watching the retreating boat, with his hands clasped behind him.
<br> 
<br> “By God,” he said, “I don’t know what to make of that man! I believe the captain’s right, and that he’ll capture the Rajah before nightfall, yet he’ll have no shot from my cannon.”
<br> 
<br> The Woman in White, as soon as she was out of sight of the camp, made record time to the coast, traversed the deep channel between the river and the sea with some caution, then struck straight out to the west. The sun was still about two hours above the western ocean. Far to the north the Rajah could be seen keeping closer inshore than seemed quite safe, the captain’s idea being doubtless to get out of sight behind the first headland he might encounter. The heavily laden boat was burning up coal with reckless prodigality, the slight wind from the shore carrying out to sea a great black banner of smoke. Stranleigh walked forward to the captain.
<br> 
<br> “Can you overtake him before sunset?” he asked.
<br> 
<br> “I think so, sir.”
<br> 
<br> “Well, I imagine our best plan is to convince him as speedily as possible that he can’t run away from us. I don’t like to see him wasting coal like that. Coal is more valuable than the ore he carries until we reach Teneriffe. Full speed ahead, captain.”
<br> 
<br> The hum of the turbines rose and rose, and the trembling of the yacht perceptibly increased as the sharp prow clove through the waters with the speed of a torpedo-boat destroyer. The steward, setting out cups and saucers for tea, on a wicker table, found some difficulty in keeping the jingling dishes from catastrophe. The Rajah had about four hours the start, and had probably worried away thirty knots of the long route she was to travel. Higher and higher she seemed to rise in the water, and the sun was still a good quarter of an hour above the horizon when The Woman in White came tearing up alongside to landward of her, carried now by her own momentum, for the turbines had been stopped some distance away. Apparently everybody on board was leaning over the rail watching the amazing speed of the swanlike craft, white and graceful, as she gradually slowed down. Stranleigh recognized the anxious face of the captain, and shouted up at him:
<br> 
<br> “Tell your stokers to economize on that coal.” The captain replied truculently:
<br> 
<br> “No one gives orders on this steamer but me.”
<br> 
<br> “Quite right,” replied Stranleigh, with less imperiousness than had barbed his first shout. “That’s why I’m asking you to give the command.”
<br> 
<br> The captain, after a moment’s hesitation, sent the order below, then turned again to the white vessel, which was now keeping exact time with his own black one.
<br> 
<br> “Captain,” said Stranleigh, in his ordinary tone of voice, “both Frowningshield and myself were very sorry you could not lunch with us, so perhaps you will be good enough to come aboard this yacht and dine with me.”
<br> 
<br> “A captain cannot leave his ship,” curtly replied the master of the Rajah.
<br> 
<br> “Ordinarily, no, but this is an exceptional case. I’ve got a letter for you, captain.”
<br> 
<br> “Then why didn’t you give it to me at noon?”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, come now, a man can’t think of everything when he is overjoyed at receiving an expected and very welcome guest. You must admit, captain, that once I undertook the work of ocean postman, I lost no time in giving you the double knock. I don’t think there’s anything in these waters would have overhauled you so quickly as I have done. Won’t you then make an exception, and honor us with your presence?”
<br> 
<br> “No, I will not. If, as you say, you’ve got a letter for me, I’ll throw down a line for it.”
<br> 
<br> “Well, on the face of it, that seems fair. A man in England drops you a line, and you drop a line for his line. Nevertheless, this letter, although addressed to you, I do not intend to part with. There are several documents in my pocket which I’d like to show you, and I wish to make some explanations that will interest you.”
<br> 
<br> “Look here, Mr. Stranleigh, I’m captain aboard this steamer, and I’m on the high seas. I warn you, before witnesses here, that any interference on your part is piracy. I shall not come aboard your steamer, nor shall I allow any one from your steamer to come aboard of me. I take orders from none but my own masters, the owners of this ship. I am now under their orders, and acting upon them. I won’t stand any interference.”
<br> 
<br> “Again I say quite right, captain. Your sentiments are admirable, and your views of nautical duty are correct. Nevertheless, it is necessary that you and I should enjoy a quiet talk together, and I ask you to favor me by coming aboard.”
<br> 
<br> “Well, I won’t.”
<br> 
<br> “Then, as the mountain wouldn’t come to Mahomet, Mahomet went to the mountain. I ask your permission to go aboard your vessel.”
<br> 
<br> “I shan’t give it. I’ve told you that before. Now, sheer off, or I’ll put a cannon ball into your engine room.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, have you got a cannon ball on board? How jolly! We are entirely unarmed so far as ordnance is concerned, but I’d like to say, captain, that the chances are ten to one your cannon ball wouldn’t do much harm. You might even plant a floating mine in front of The Woman in White, and although it probably would blow her prow up, yet I think, crablike, I could crawl backward to the nearest port, as the White Star liner Suevic made her way from the Lizard to Southampton.”
<br> 
<br> “Are you going to sheer off, sir.”
<br> 
<br> “No, and you are not going to fire, either, captain. It isn’t etiquette at sea to shoot cannon balls at a man until you have finished the cigars he has presented to you. I dislike very much to allude to my own gifts in this way, but still I wish you to understand that I am well versed in nautical law.”
<br> 
<br> “I want to get along with my voyage, Mr. Stranleigh, unmolested.”
<br> 
<br> “Why, bless your tarry heart, captain, get along with your voyage. If you can run away from us, don’t let me put any obstacle in your path.”
<br> 
<br> “Will you sheer off, sir.”
<br> 
<br> “Certainly not. I’m quite within my rights. This part of the ocean belongs as much to me as to the Rajah. I’m not delaying you in the least, and all your talk of interference is mere humbug. If I ran my craft close enough to endanger yours, you might have a right to object; but I call your attention to the fact that we are under perfect control, and I can keep the distance between the ships to an inch. If I went farther away, I should be unable to converse with you without straining my throat, which I decline to do. Now, you will neither come aboard my vessel, nor allow me to go aboard yours.”
<br> 
<br> “That’s right.”
<br> 
<br> “Well, I don’t think it is. Nevertheless, you force me to do what I should much rather, for your sake, not do, and that is I am compelled to read your letter, and the documents I have referred to, in the hearing of your crew and my own.”
<br> 
<br> “You may read what you like to the crew.”
<br> 
<br> “Captain, I ask you to reconsider that dictum. I grant that you might honestly have made such a remark on any other voyage you have ever taken during your long seafaring life, except this one. Just think for a moment. Don’t reply rashly, and be assured that I mean no harm to you, nor to anybody else aboard your ship. Quite the contrary. What I intend to do will be greatly to your advantage, and to that of every man who is with you.”
<br> 
<br> When Lord Stranleigh made reference to his present voyage, the captain, who had been leaning against the rail, stood up suddenly. The men were whispering with one another. The captain saw that Stranleigh had taken from his pocket several envelopes, and stood there awaiting his reply. At last the captain said huskily:
<br> 
<br> “Will you come aboard alone, sir?”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, quite alone, of course, since it is your wish, or you can come aboard here with half a dozen or a dozen men as your bodyguard, if you like. Bring the cannon, too, if it makes you feel any safer.”
<br> 
<br> “I’d rather you came aboard here, sir.”
<br> 
<br> “Very good. Fling over a slightly stronger line than you’d have sent down for the letter, and I’ll be with you in a jiffy.”
<br> 
<br> “But how am I to know some others won’t climb up?”
<br> 
<br> “Well, hang it, arm your men with handspikes, and knock ’em down again. Don’t keep me waiting here all night. It will be dark very soon, and I shan’t occupy more than ten minutes of your time. You seem spoiling for a fight, but I can’t accommodate you. I’m a man of peace, and that’s why I shudder when you speak to me of cannon. I swear I’ll tell Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and President Roosevelt the way you’re behaving. You’re a positive danger on the high seas, with your ultimatums, and your shots through the engine room, and all that. Heave over a line, and get your men to watch that the yacht doesn’t spring aboard of you. No wonder we English are disliked for our browbeating.”
<br> 
<br> The captain seemed rather ashamed of his fears in face of this bantering, and besides, some of his crew had laughed, which still further disconcerted him. A rope fell coiling through the air, and came slap on deck.
<br> 
<br> “Hang tight aloft there,” cried Stranleigh, as he jerked the rope taut, swung himself free of his own boat, and clambered up the black cliff of the Rajah hand over hand, feet against the side like a monkey.
