He had no feeling of his left hand but he braked all he could with his right and the line rushed out. Finally his left hand found the line and he leaned back against the line and now it burned his back and his left hand, and his left hand was taking all the strain and cutting badly. He looked back at the coils of line and they were feeding smoothly. Just then the fish jumped making a great bursting of the ocean and then a heavy fall. Then he jumped again and again and the boat was going fast although line was still racing out and the old man was raising the strain to breaking point and raising it to breaking point again and again. He had been pulled down tight onto the bow and his face was in the cut slice of dolphin and he could not move.</p> 
<div>
 　　他的右拳猛的朝他的脸撞去，钓索火辣辣地从他右手里溜出去，他惊醒过来了。他的左手失去了知觉，他就用右手拚命拉住了钓索，但它还是一个劲儿地朝外溜。他的左手终于抓住了钓索，他仰着身子把钓索朝后拉，这一来钓索火辣辣地勒着他的背脊和左手，这左手承受了全部的拉力，给勒得好痛。他回头望望那些钓索卷儿，它们正在滑溜地放出钓索。正在这当儿，鱼跳起来了，使海面大大地迸裂开来，然后沉重地掉下去。接着它跳了一次又一次，船走得很快，然而钓索依旧飞也似地向外溜，老人把它拉紧到就快绷断的程度，他一次次把它拉紧到就快绷断的程度。他被拉得紧靠在船头上，脸庞贴在那爿切下的鲯鳅肉上，他没法动弹。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　This is what we waited for, he thought. So now let us take it.
</div> 
<div>
 　　我们等着的事儿发生啦，他想。我们来对付它吧。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　Make him pay for the line, he thought. Make him pay for it.
</div> 
<div>
 　　让它为了拖钓索付出代价吧，他想。让它为了这个付出代价吧。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　He could not see the fish‘s jumps but only heard the breaking of the ocean and the heavy splash as he fell. The speed of the line was cutting his hands badly but he had always known this would happen and he tried to keep the cutting across the calloused parts and not let the line slip into the palm nor cut the fingers.
</div> 
<div>
 　　他看不见鱼的跳跃，只听得见海面的迸裂声，和鱼掉下时沉重的水花飞溅声。飞快地朝外溜的钓索把他的手勒得好痛，但是他一直知道这事迟早会发生，就设法让钓索勒在起老茧的部位，不让它滑到掌心或者勒在手指头上。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　If the boy was here he would wet the coils of line, he thought. Yes. If the boy were here. If the boy were here.
</div> 
<div>
 　　如果那孩子在这儿，他会用水打湿这些钓索卷儿，他想。是啊。如果孩子在这儿。如果孩子在这儿。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　The line went out and out and out but it was slowing now and he was making the fish earn each inch of it. Now he got his head up from the wood and out of the slice of fish that his cheek had crushed. Then he was on his knees and then he rose slowly to his feet. He was ceding line but more slowly all he time. He worked back to where he could feel with his foot the coils of line that he could not see. There was plenty of line still and now the fish had to pull the friction of all that new line through the water.
</div> 
<div>
 　　钓索朝外溜着，溜着，溜着，不过这时越来越慢了，他正在让鱼每拖走一英寸都得付出代价。现在他从木船板上抬起头来，不再贴在那爿被他脸颊压烂的鱼肉上了。然后他跪着，然后慢慢儿站起身来。他正在放出钓索，然而越来越慢了。他把身子慢慢挪到可以用脚碰到那一卷卷他看不见的钓索的地方。钓索还有很多，现在这鱼不得不在水里拖着这许多摩擦力大的新钓索了。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　Yes, he thought. And now he has jumped more than a dozen times and filled the sacks along his back with air and he cannot go down deep to die where I cannot bring him up. He will start circling soon and then I must work on him. I wonder what started him so suddenly? Could it have been hunger that made him desperate, or was he frightened by something in the night? Maybe he suddenly felt fear. But he was such a calm, strong fish and he seemed so fearless and so confident. It is strange.
</div> 
<div>
 　　是啊，他想。到这时它已经跳了不止十二次，把沿着背脊的那些液囊装满了空气，所以没法沉到深水中，在那儿死去，使我没法把它捞上来。它不久就会转起圈子来，那时我一定想法对付它。不知道它怎么会这么突然地跳起来的。敢情饥饿使它不顾死活了，还是在夜间被什么东西吓着了？也许它突然感到害怕了。不过它是一条那样沉着、健壮的鱼，似乎是毫无畏惧而信心十足的。这很奇怪。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You better be fearless and confident yourself, old man," he said. "You‘re holding him again but you cannot get line. But soon he has to circle."
</div> 
<div>
 　　“你最好自己也毫无畏惧而信心十足，老家伙，”他说。“你又把它拖住了，可是你没法收回钓索。不过它马上就得打转了。”
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　The old man held him with his left hand and his shoulders now and stooped down and scooped up water in his right hand to get the crushed dolphin flesh off of his face. He was afraid that it might nauseate him and he would vomit and lose his strength. When his face was cleaned he washed his right hand in the water over the side and then let it stay in the salt water while he watched the first light come before the sunrise. He‘s headed almost east, he thought. That means he is tired and going with the current. Soon he will have to circle. Then our true work begins.
</div> 
<div>
 　　老人这时用他的左手和肩膀拽住了它，弯下身去，用右手舀水洗掉粘在脸上的压烂的鲯鳅肉。他怕这肉会使他恶心，弄得他呕吐，丧失力气。擦干净了脸，他把右手在船舷外的水里洗洗，然后让它泡在这盐水里，一面注视着日出前的第一线曙光。它几乎是朝正东方走的，他想。这表明它疲乏了，随着潮流走。它马上就得打转了。那时我们才真正开始干啦。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　After he judged that his right hand had been in the water long enough he took it out and looked at it.
</div> 
<div>
 　　等他觉得把右手在水里泡的时间够长了，他把它拿出水来，朝它瞧着。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It is not bad," he said. "And pain does not matter to a man."
</div> 
<div>
 　　“情况不坏，”他说。“疼痛对一条汉子来说，算不上什么。”
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　He took hold of the line carefully so that it did not fit into any of the fresh line cuts and shifted his weight so that he could put his left hand into the sea on the other side of the skiff.
</div> 
<div>
 　　他小心地攥着钓索，使它不致嵌进新勒破的任何一道伤痕，把身子挪到小船的另一边，这样他能把左手伸进海里。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You did not do so badly for something worthless," he said to his left hand. "But there was a moment when I could not find you."
</div> 
<div>
 　　“你这没用的东西，总算干得还不坏，”他对他的左手说。“可是曾经有一会儿，我得不到你的帮助。”
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　Why was I not born with two good hands? he thought. Perhaps it was my fault in not training that one properly. But God knows he has had enough chances to learn. He did not do so badly in the night, though, and he has only cramped once. If he cramps again let the line cut him off.
</div> 
<div>
 　　为什么我不生下来就有两只好手呢？他想。也许是我自己的过错，没有好好儿训练这只手。可是天知道它曾有过够多的学习机会。然而它今天夜里干得还不错，仅仅抽了一回筋。要是它再抽筋，就让这钓索把它勒断吧。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　When he thought that he knew that he was not being clear-headed and he thought he should chew some more of the dolphin. But I can‘t, he told himself. It is better to be light-headed than to lose your strength from nausea. And I know I cannot keep it if I eat it since my face was in it. I will keep it for an emergency until it goes bad. But it is too late to try for strength now through nourishment. You‘re stupid, he told himself. Eat the other flying fish.
</div> 
<div>
 　　他想到这里，明白自己的头脑不怎么清醒了，他想起应该再吃一点鲯鳅。可是我不能，他对自己说。情愿头昏目眩，也不能因恶心欲吐而丧失力气。我还知道吃了胃里也搁不住，因为我的脸曾经压在它上面。我要把它留下以防万一，直到它腐臭了为止。不过要想靠营养来增强力气，如今已经太晚了。你真蠢，他对自己说。把另外那条飞鱼吃了吧。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　It was there, cleaned and ready, and he picked it up with his left hand and ate it chewing the bones carefully and eating all of it down to the tail.
</div> 
<div>
 　　它就在那儿，已经洗干净，就可以吃了，他就用左手把它捡起，吃起来，细细咀嚼着鱼骨，从头到尾全都吃了。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　It has more nourishment than almost any fish, he thought. At least the kind of strength that I need. Now I have done what I can, he thought. Let him begin to circle and let the fight come.
</div> 
<div>
 　　它几乎比什么鱼都更富有营养，他想。至少能给我所需要的那种力气。我如今已经做到了我能做到的一切，他想。让这鱼打起转来，就来交锋吧。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　The sun was rising for the third time since he had put to sea when the fish started to circle.
</div> 
<div>
 　　自从他出海以来，这是第三次出太阳，这时鱼打起转来了。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　He could not see by the slant of the line that the fish was circling. It was too early for that. He just felt a faint slackening of the pressure of the line and be commenced to pull on it gently with his right hand. It tightened, as always, but just when he reached the point where it would break, line began to come in. He slipped his shoulders and head from under the line and began to pull in line steadily and gently. He used both of his hands in a swinging motion and tried to do the pulling as much as he could with his body and his legs. His old legs and shoulders pivoted with the swinging of the pulling.
</div> 
<div>
 　　他根据钓索的斜度还看不出鱼在打转。这为时尚早。他仅仅感觉到钓索上的拉力微微减少了一些，就开始用右手轻轻朝里拉。钓索象往常那样绷紧了，可是拉到快迸断的当儿，却渐渐可以回收了。他把钓索从肩膀和头上卸下来，动手平稳而和缓地回收钓索。他用两只手大幅度地一把把拉着，尽量使出全身和双腿的力气来拉。他一把把地拉着，两条老迈的腿儿和肩膀跟着转动。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It is a very big circle," he said. "But he is circling."
</div> 
<div>
 　　“这圈子可真大，”他说。“它可总算在打转啦。”
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　Then the line would not come in any more and he held it until he saw the drops jumping from it in the sun. Then it started out and the old man knelt down and let it go grudgingly back into the dark water.
</div> 
<div>
 　　跟着钓索就此收不回来了，他紧紧拉着，竟看见水珠儿在阳光里从钓索上迸出来。随后钓索开始往外溜了，老人跪下了，老大不愿地让它又渐渐回进深暗的水中。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　"He is making the far part of his circle now," he said. I must hold all I can, he thought. The strain will shorten his circle each time. Perhaps in an hour I will see him. Now I must convince him and then I must kill him.
</div> 
<div>
 　　“它正绕到圈子的对面去了，”他说。我一定要拚命拉紧，他想。拉紧了，它兜的圈子就会一次比一次小。也许一个钟点内我就能见到它。我眼下一定要稳住它，过后我一定要弄死它。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　But the fish kept on circling slowly and the old man was wet with sweat and tired deep into his bones two hours later. But the circles were much shorter now and from the way the line slanted he could tell the fish had risen steadily while he swam.
</div> 
<div>
 　　但是这鱼只顾慢慢地打着转，两小时后，老人浑身汗湿，疲乏得入骨了。不过这时圈子已经小得多了，而且根据钓索的斜度，他能看出鱼一边游一边在不断地上升。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　For an hour the old man had been seeing black spots before his eyes and the sweat salted his eyes and salted the cut over his eye and on his forehead. He was not afraid of the black spots. They were normal at the tension that he was pulling on the line. Twice, though, he had felt faint and dizzy and that had worried him.
</div> 
<div>
 　　老人看见眼前有些黑点子，已经有一个钟点了，汗水中的盐份沤着他的眼睛，沤着眼睛上方和脑门上的伤口。他不怕那些黑点子。他这么紧张地拉着钓索，出现黑点子是正常的现象。但是他已有两回感到头昏目眩，这叫他担心。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I could not fail myself and die on a fish like this," he said. "Now that I have him coming so beautifully, God help me endure. I‘ll say a hundred Our Fathers and a hundred Hail Marys. But I cannot say them now."
</div> 
<div>
 　　“我不能让自己垮下去，就这样死在一条鱼的手里，”他说。“既然我已经叫它这样漂亮地过来了，求天主帮助我熬下去吧。我要念一百遍《天主经》和一百遍《圣母经》。不过眼下还不能念。”
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　Consider them said, he thought. I‘ll say them later.
</div> 
<div>
 　　就算这些已经念过了吧，他想。我过后会念的。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　Just then he felt a sudden banging and jerking on the line he held with his two hands. It was sharp and hard-feeling and heavy.
</div> 
<div>
 　　就在这当儿，他觉得自己双手攥住的钓索突然给撞击、拉扯了一下。来势很猛，有一种强劲的感觉，很是沉重。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　He is hitting the wire leader with his spear, he thought. That was bound to come. He had to do that. It may make him jump though and I would rather he stayed circling now. The jumps were necessary for him to take air. But after that each one can widen the opening of the hook wound and he can throw the hook.
</div> 
<div>
 　　它正用它的长嘴撞击着铁丝导线，他想。这是免不了的。它不能不这样干。然而这一来也许会使它跳起来，我可是情愿它眼下继续打转的。它必须跳出水面来呼吸空气。但是每跳一次，钓钩造成的伤口就会裂得大一些，它可能把钓钩甩掉。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Don‘t jump, fish," he said. "Don‘t jump."
</div> 
<div>
 　　“别跳，鱼啊，”他说。“别跳啦。”
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　The fish hit the wire several times more and each time he shook his head the old man gave up a little line.
</div> 
<div>
 　　鱼又撞击了铁丝导线好几次，它每次一甩头，老人就放出一些钓索。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　I must hold his pain where it is, he thought. Mine does not matter. I can control mine. But his pain could drive him mad.
</div> 
<div>
 　　我必须让它的疼痛老是在一处地方，他想。我的疼痛不要紧。我能控制。但是它的疼痛能使它发疯。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　After a while the fish stopped beating at the wire and started circling slowly again. The old man was gaining line steadily now. But he felt faint again. He lifted some sea water with his left hand and put it on his head. Then he put more on and rubbed the back of his neck.
</div> 
<div>
 　　过了片刻，鱼不再撞击铁丝，又慢慢地打起转来。老人这时正不停地收进钓索。可是他又感到头晕了。他用左手舀了些海水，洒在脑袋上。然后他再洒了点，在脖颈上揉擦着。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I have no cramps," he said. "He‘ll be up soon and I can last. You have to last. Don‘t even speak of it."
</div> 
<div>
 　　“我没抽筋，”他说。“它马上就会冒出水来，我熬得住。你非熬下去不可。连提也别再提了吧。”
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　He kneeled against the bow and, for a moment, slipped the line over his back again. I‘ll rest now while he goes out on the circle and then stand up and work on him when he comes in, he decided.
</div> 
<div>
 　　他靠着船头跪下，暂时又把钓索挎在背上。我眼下要趁它朝外兜圈子的时候歇一下，等它兜回来的时候再站起身来对付它，他这样下了决心。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　It was a great temptation to rest in the bow and let the fish make one circle by himself without recovering any line. But when the strain showed the fish had turned to come toward the boat, the old man rose to his feet and started the pivoting and the weaving pulling that brought in all the line he gained.
</div> 
<div>
 　　他巴不得在船头上歇一下，让鱼自顾自兜一个圈子，并不回收一点钓索。但是等到钓索松动了一点，表明鱼已经转身在朝小船游回来，老人就站起身来，开始那种左右转动交替拉曳的动作，他的钓索全是这样收回来的。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　I‘m tireder than I have ever been, he thought, and now the trade wind is rising. But that will be good to take him in with. I need that badly.
</div> 
<div>
 　　我从来没有这样疲乏过，他想，而现在刮起贸易风来了。但是正好靠它来把这鱼拖回去。我多需要这风啊。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I‘ll rest on the next turn as he goes out," he said. "I feel much better. Then in two or three turns more I will have him."
</div> 
<div>
 　　“等它下一趟朝外兜圈子的时候，我要歇一下，”他说。“我觉得好过多了。再兜两三圈，我就能逮住它。”
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　His straw hat was far on the back of his head and he sank down into the bow with the pull of the line as he felt the fish turn.
</div> 
<div>
 　　他的草帽被推到后脑勺上去了，他感到鱼在转身，随着钓索一扯，他在船头上一起股坐下了。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　You work now, fish, he thought. I‘ll take you at the turn.
</div> 
<div>
 　　你现在忙你的吧，鱼啊，他想。你转身时我再来对付你。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　The sea had risen considerably. But it was a fair-weather breeze and he had to have it to get home.
</div> 
<div>
 　　海浪大了不少。不过这是晴天吹的微风，他得靠它才能回去。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I‘ll just steer south and west," he said. "A man is never lost at sea and it is a long island."
</div> 
<div>
 　　“我只消朝西南航行就成，”他说。“人在海上是决不会迷路的，何况这是个长长的岛屿。”
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　It was on the third turn that he saw the fish first.
</div> 
<div>
 　　鱼兜到第三圈，他才第一次看见它。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　He saw him first as a dark shadow that took so long to pass under the boat that he could not believe its length.
</div> 
<div>
 　　他起先看见的是一个黑乎乎的影子，它需要那么长的时间从船底下经过，他简直不相信它有这么长。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No," he said. "He can‘t be that big."
</div> 
<div>
 　　“不能，”他说。“它哪能这么大啊。”
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　But he was that big and at the end of this circle he came to the surface only thirty yards away and the man saw his tail out of water. It was higher than a big scythe blade and a very pale lavender above the dark blue water. It raked back and as the fish swam just below the surface the old man could see his huge bulk and the purple stripes that banded him. His dorsal fin was down and his huge pectorals were spread wide.
</div> 
<div>
 　　但是它当真有这么大，这一圈兜到末了，它冒出水来，只有三十码远，老人看见它的尾巴露出在水面上。这尾巴比一把大镰刀的刀刃更高，是极淡的浅紫色，竖在深蓝色的海面上。它朝后倾斜着，鱼在水面下游的时候，老人看得见它庞大的身躯和周身的紫色条纹。它的脊鳍朝下耷拉着，巨大的胸鳍大张着。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　On this circle the old man could see the fish‘s eye and the two gray sucking fish that swam around him. Sometimes they attached themselves to him. Sometimes they darted off. Sometimes they would swim easily in his shadow. They were each over three feet long and when they swam fast they lashed their whole bodies like eels.
</div> 
<div>
 　　这回鱼兜圈子回来时，老人看见它的眼睛和绕着它游的两条灰色的乳鱼。它们有时候依附在它身上。有时候倏地游开去。有时候会在它的阴影里自在地游着。它们每条都有三英尺多长，游得快时全身猛烈地甩动着，象鳗鱼一般。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　The old man was sweating now but from something else besides the sun. On each calm placid turn the fish made he was gaining line and he was sure that in two turns more he would have a chance to get the harpoon in.
</div> 
<div>
 　　老人这时在冒汗，但不光是因为晒了太阳，还有别的原因。鱼每回沉着、平静地拐回来时，他总收回一点钓索，所以他确信再兜上两个圈子，就能有机会把鱼叉扎进去了。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　But I must get him close, close, close, he thought. I mustn‘t try for the head. I must get the heart.
</div> 
<div>
 　　可是我必须把它拉得极近，极近，极近，他想。我千万不能扎它的脑袋。我该扎进它的心脏。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Be calm and strong, old man," he said.
</div> 
<div>
 　　“要沉着，要有力，老头儿，”他说。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　On the next circle the fish‘s back was out but he was a little too far from the boat. On the next circle he was still too far away but he was higher out of water and the old man was sure that by gaining some more line he could have him alongside.
</div> 
<div>
 　　又兜了一圈，鱼的背脊露出来了，不过它离小船还是太远了一点。再兜了一圈，还是太远，但是它露出在水面上比较高些了，老人深信，再收回一些钓索，就可以把它拉到船边来。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　He had rigged his harpoon long before and its coil of light rope was in a round basket and the end was made fast to the bitt in the bow.
</div> 
<div>
 　　他早就把鱼叉准备停当，叉上的那卷细绳子给搁在一只圆筐内，一端紧系在船头的系缆柱上。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　The fish was coming in on his circle now calm and beautiful looking and only his great tail moving. The old man pulled on him all that he could to bring him closer. For just a moment the fish turned a little on his side. Then he straightened himself and began another circle.
</div> 
<div>
 　　这时鱼正兜了一个圈子回来，既沉着又美丽，只有它的大尾巴在动。老人竭尽全力把它拉得近些。有那么一会儿，鱼的身子倾斜了一点儿。然后它竖直了身子，又兜起圈子来。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I moved him," the old man said. "I moved him then."
</div> 
<div>
 　　“我把它拉动了，”老人说。“我刚才把它拉动了。”
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　He felt faint again now but he held on the great fish all the strain that he could. I moved him, he thought. Maybe this time I can get him over. Pull, hands, he thought. Hold up, legs. Last for me, head. Last for me. You never went. This time I‘ll pull him over.
</div> 
<div>
 　　他又感到头晕，可是他竭尽全力拽住了那条大鱼。我把它拉动了，他想。也许这一回我能把它拉过来。拉呀，手啊，他想。站稳了，腿儿。为了我熬下去吧，头。为了我熬下去吧。你从没晕倒过。这一回我要把它拉过来。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　But when he put all of his effort on, starting it well out before the fish came alongside and pulling with all his strength, the fish pulled part way over and then righted himself and swam away.
</div> 
<div>
 　　但是，等他把浑身的力气都使出来，趁鱼还没来到船边，还很远时就动手，使出全力拉着，那鱼却侧过一半身子，然后竖直了身子游开去。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Fish," the old man said. "Fish, you are going to have to die anyway. Do you have to kill me too?"
</div> 
<div>
 　　“鱼啊，”老人说。“鱼，你反正是死定了。难道你非得把我也害死吗？”
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　That way nothing is accomplished, he thought. His mouth was too dry to speak but he could not reach for the water now. I must get him alongside this time, he thought. I am not good for many more turns. Yes you are, he told himself. You‘re good for ever.
</div> 
<div>
 　　照这样下去是会一事无成的，他想。他嘴里干得说不出话来，但是此刻他不能伸手去拿水来喝。我这一回必须把它拉到船边来，他想。它再多兜几圈，我就不行了。不，你是行的，他对自己说。你永远行的。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　On the next turn, he nearly had him. But again the fish righted himself and swam slowly away.
</div> 
<div>
 　　在兜下一圈时，他差一点把它拉了过来。可是这鱼又竖直了身子，慢慢地游走了。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　You are killing me, fish, the old man thought. But you have a right to. Never have I seen a greater, or more beautiful, or a calmer or more noble thing than you, brother. Come on and kill me. I do not care who kills who.
</div> 
<div>
 　　你要把我害死啦，鱼啊，老人想。不过你有权利这样做。我从没见过比你更庞大、更美丽、更沉着或更崇高的东西，老弟。来，把我害死吧。我不在乎谁害死谁。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　Now you are getting confused in the head, he thought. You must keep your head clear. Keep your head clear and know how to suffer like a man. Or a fish, he thought.
</div> 
<div>
 　　你现在头脑糊涂起来啦，他想。你必须保持头脑清醒。保持头脑清醒，要象个男子汉，懂得怎样忍受痛苦。或者象一条鱼那样，他想。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Clear up, head," he said in a voice he could hardly hear. "Clear up."
</div> 
<div>
 　　“清醒过来吧，头，”他用自己也简直听不见的声音说。“清醒过来吧。”
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　Twice more it was the same on the turns.
</div> 
<div>
 　　鱼又兜了两圈，还是老样子。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　I do not know, the old man thought. He had been on the point of feeling himself go each time. I do not know. But I will try it once more.
</div> 
<div>
 　　我弄不懂，老人想。每一回他都觉得自己快要垮了。我弄不懂。但我还要试一下。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　He tried it once more and he felt himself going when he turned the fish. The fish righted himself and swam off again slowly with the great tail weaving in the air.
</div> 
<div>
 　　他又试了一下，等他把鱼拉得转过来时，他感到自己要垮了。那鱼竖直了身子，又慢慢地游开去，大尾巴在海面上摇摆着。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　I‘ll try it again, the old man promised, although his hands were mushy now and he could only see well in flashes.
</div> 
<div>
 　　我还要试一下，老人对自己许愿，尽管他的双手这时已经软弱无力，眼睛也不好使，只看得见间歇的一起。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　He tried it again and it was the same. So he thought, and he felt himself going before he started; I will try it once again.
</div> 
<div>
 　　他又试了一下，又是同样情形。原来如此，他想，还没动手就感到要垮下来了，我还要再试一下。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　He took all his pain and what was left of his strength and his long gone pride and he put it against the fish‘s agony and the fish came over onto his side and swam gently on his side, his bill almost touching the planking of the skiff and started to pass the boat, long, deep, wide, silver and barred with purple and interminable in the water.
</div> 
<div>
 　　他忍住了一切痛楚，拿出剩余的力气和丧失已久的自傲，用来对付这鱼的痛苦挣扎，于是它游到了他的身边，在他身边斯文地游着，它的嘴几乎碰着了小船的船壳板，它开始在船边游过去，身子又长，又高，又宽，银色底上有着紫色条纹，在水里看来长得无穷无尽。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　The old man dropped the line and put his foot on it and lifted the harpoon as high as he could and drove it down with all his strength, and more strength he had just summoned, into the fish‘s side just behind the great chest fin that rose high in the air to the altitude of the man‘s chest. He felt the iron go in and he leaned on it and drove it further and then pushed all his weight after it.
</div> 
<div>
 　　老人放下钓索，一脚踩住了，把鱼叉举得尽可能地高，使出全身的力气，加上他刚才鼓起的力气，把它朝下直扎进鱼身的一边，就在大胸鳍后面一点儿的地方，这胸鳍高高地竖立着，高齐老人的胸膛。他感到那铁叉扎了进去，就把身子倚在上面，把它扎得更深一点，再用全身的重量把它压下去。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　Then the fish came alive, with his death in him, and rose high out of the water showing all his great beauty. He seemed to hang in the air above the old man in the skiff. Then he fell into the water with a crash that sent spray over the old man and over all of the skiff.
</div> 
<div>
 　　于是那鱼闹腾起来，尽管死到临头了，它仍从水中高高跳起，把它那惊人的长度和宽度，它的力量和美，全都暴露无遗。它仿佛悬在空中，就在小船中老人的头顶上空。然后，它砰的一声掉在水里，浪花溅了老人一身，溅了一船。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　The old man felt faint and sick and he could not see well. But he cleared the harpoon line and let it run slowly through his raw hands and, when he could see, he saw the fish was on his back with his silver belly up. The shaft of the harpoon was projectin g at an angle from the fish‘s shoulder and the sea was discolouring with the red of the blood from his heart. First it was dark as a shoal in the blue water that was more than a mile deep. Then it spread like a cloud. The fish was silvery and still and floated with the waves.
</div> 
<div>
 　　老人感到头晕，恶心，看不大清楚东西。然而他放松了鱼叉上的绳子，让它从他划破了皮的双手之间慢慢地溜出去，等他的眼睛好使了，他看见那鱼仰天躺着，银色的肚皮朝上。鱼叉的柄从鱼的肩部斜截出来，海水被它心脏里流出的鲜血染红了。起先，这摊血黑魆魆的，如同这一英里多深的蓝色海水中的一块礁石。然后它象云彩般扩散开来。那鱼是银色的，一动不动地随着波浪浮动着。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　The old man looked carefully in the glimpse of vision that he had. Then he took two turns of the harpoon line around the bitt in the bow and laid his head on his hands.
</div> 
<div>
 　　老人用他偶尔着得清的眼睛仔细望着。接着他把鱼叉上的绳子在船头的系缆柱上绕了两圈，然后把脑袋搁在双手上。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Keep my head clear," he said against the wood of the bow. "I am a tired old man. But I have killed this fish which is my brother and now I must do the slave work."
</div> 
<div>
 　　“让我的头脑保持清醒吧，”他靠在船头的木板上说。“我是个疲乏的老头儿。可是我杀死了这条鱼，它是我的兄弟，现在我得去干辛苦的活儿了。”
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　Now I must prepare the nooses and the rope to lash him alongside, he thought. Even if we were two and swamped her to load him and bailed her out, this skiff would never hold him. I must prepare everything, then bring him in and lash him well and step the mast and set sail for home.
</div> 
<div>
 　　现在我得准备好套索和绳子，把它绑在船边，他想。即使我这里有两个人，把船装满了水来把它拉上船，然后把水舀掉，这条小船也绝对容不下它。我得做好一切准备，然后把拖过来，好好绑住，竖起桅杆，张起帆驶回去。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　He started to pull the fish in to have him alongside so that he could pass a line through his gills and out his mouth and make his head fast alongside the bow. I want to see him, he thought, and to touch and to feel him. He is my fortune, he thought. But that is not why I wish to feel him. I think I felt his heart, he thought. When I pushed on the harpoon shaft the second time. Bring him in now and make him fast and get the noose around his tail and another around his middle to bind him to the skiff.
</div> 
<div>
 　　他动手把鱼拖到船边，这样可以用一根绳子穿进它的鳃，从嘴里拉出来，把它的脑袋紧绑在船头边。我想看看它，他想，碰碰它，摸摸它。它是我的财产，他想。然而我想摸摸它倒不是为了这个。我以为刚才已经碰到了它的心脏，他想。那是在我第二次握着鱼叉的柄扎进去的时候。现在得把它拖过来，牢牢绑住，用一根套索拴住它的尾巴，另一根拴住它的腰部，把它绑牢在这小船上。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Get to work, old man," he said. He took a very small drink of the water. "There is very much slave work to be done now that the fight is over."
</div> 
<div>
 　　“动手干活吧，老头儿，”他说。他喝了很少的一口水。“战斗既然结束了，就有好多辛苦的活儿要干呢。”
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　He looked up at the sky and then out to his fish. He looked at the sun carefully. It is not much more than noon, he thought. And the trade wind is rising. The lines all mean nothing now. The boy and I will splice them when we are home.
</div> 
<div>
 　　他抬头望望天空，然后望望船外的鱼。他仔细望望太阳。晌午才过了没多少时候，他想。而贸易风刮起来了。这些钓索现在都用不着了。回家以后，那孩子和我要把它们捻接起来。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Come on, fish," he said. But the fish did not come. Instead he lay there wallowing now in the seas and the old man pulled the skiff up onto him. When he was even with him and had the fish‘s head against the bow he could not believe his size. But he untied the harpoon rope from the bitt, passed it through the fish‘s gills and out his jaws, made a turn around his sword then passed the rope through t he other gill, made another turn around the bill and knotted the double rope and made it fast to the bitt in the bow. He cut the rope then and went astern to noose the tail. The fish had turned silver from his original purple and silver, and the stripes showed the same pale violet colour as his tail. They were wider than a man‘s hand with his fingers spread and the fish‘s eye looked as detached as the mirrors in a periscope or as a saint in a procession.
</div> 
<div>
 　　“过来吧，鱼，”他说。可是这鱼不过来。它反而躺在海面上翻滚着，老人只得把小船驶到它的身边。等他跟它并拢了，并把鱼的头靠在船头边，他简直无法相信它竟这么大。他从系缆柱上解下鱼叉柄上的绳子，穿进鱼鳃，从嘴里拉出来，在它那剑似的长上颚上绕了一圈，然后穿过另一个鱼鳃，在剑嘴上绕了一圈，把这双股绳子挽了个结，紧系在船头的系缆柱上。然后他割下一截绳子，走到船梢去套住鱼尾巴。鱼已经从原来的紫银两色变成了纯银色，条纹和尾巴显出同样的淡紫色。这些条纹比一个人揸开五指的手更宽，它的眼睛看上去冷漠得象潜望镜中的反射镜，或者迎神行列中的圣徒像。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It was the only way to kill him," the old man said. He was feeling better since the water and he knew he would not go away and his head was clear. He‘s over fifteen hundred pounds the way he is, he thought. Maybe much more. If he dresses out two-thirds of that at thirty cents a pound?
</div> 
<div>
 　　“要杀死它只有用这个办法，”老人说。他喝了水，觉得好过些了，知道自己不会垮，头脑很清醒。看样子它不止一千五百磅重，他想。也许还要重得多。如果去掉了头尾和下脚，肉有三分之二的重量，照三角钱一磅计算，该是多少？
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I need a pencil for that," he said. "My head is not that clear. But I think the great DiMaggio would be proud of me today. I had no bone spurs. But the hands and the back hurt truly." I wonder what a bone spur is, he thought. Maybe we have them without knowing of it.
</div> 
<div>
 　　“我需要一支铅笔来计算，”他说。“我的头脑并不清醒到这个程度啊。不过，我想那了不起的迪马吉奥今天会替我感到骄傲。我没有长骨刺。可是双手和背脊实在痛得厉害。”不知道骨刺是什么玩意儿，他想。也许我们都长着它，自己不知道。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　He made the fish fast to bow and stern and to the middle thwart. He was so big it was like lashing a much bigger skiff alongside. He cut a piece of line and tied the fish‘s lower jaw against his bill so his mouth would not open and they would sail as cleanly as possible. Then he stepped the mast and, with the stick that was his gaff and with his boom rigged, the patched sail drew, the boat began to move, and half lying in the stern he sailed south-west.
</div> 
<div>
 　　他把鱼紧系在船头、船梢和中央的座板上。它真大，简直象在船边绑上了另一只大得多的船。他割下一段钓索，把鱼的下颌和它的长上颚扎在一起，使它的嘴不能张开，船就可以尽可能干净利落地行驶了。然后他竖起桅杆，装上那根当鱼钩用的棍子和下桁，张起带补丁的帆，船开始移动，他半躺在船梢，向西南方驶去。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　He did not need a compass to tell him where southwest was. He only needed the feel of the trade wind and the drawing of the sail. I better put a small line out with a spoon on it and try and get something to eat and drink for the moisture. But he could not find a spoon and his sardines were rotten. So he hooked a patch of yellow Gulf weed with the gaff as they passed and shook it so that the small shrimps that were in it fell onto the planking of the skiff.
</div> 
<div>
 　　他不需要罗盘来告诉他西南方在哪里。他只消凭贸易风吹在身上的感觉和帆的动向就能知道。我还是放一根系着匙形假饵的细钓丝到水里去，钓些什么东西来吃吃吧，也可以润润嘴。可是他找不到匙形假饵，他的沙丁鱼也都腐臭了。所以他趁船经过的时候用鱼钩钩上了一簇黄色的马尾藻，把它抖抖，使里面的小虾掉在小船船板上。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　There were more than a dozen of them and they jumped and kicked like sand fleas. The old man pinched their heads off with his thumb and forefinger and ate them chewing up the shells and the tails. They were very tiny but he knew they were nourishing and they tasted good.
</div> 
<div>
 　　小虾总共有一打以上，蹦跳着，甩着脚，象沙蚤一般。老人用拇指和食指掐去它们的头，连壳带尾巴嚼着吃下去。它们很小，可是他知道它们富有营养，而且味道也好。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　The old man still had two drinks of water in the bottle and he used half of one after he had eaten the shrimps. The skiff was sailing well considering the handicaps and he steered with the tiller under his arm. He could see the fish and he had only to look at his hands and feel his back against the stern to know that this had truly happened and was not a dream. At one time when he was feeling so badly toward the end, he had thought perhaps it was a dream. Then when he had seen the fish come out of the water and hang motionless in the sky before he fell, he was sure there was some great strangeness and he could not believe it. Then he could not see well, although now he saw as well as ever.
</div> 
<div>
 　　老人瓶中还有两口水，他吃了虾以后，喝了半口。考虑到这小船的不利条件，它行驶得可算好了，他把舵柄挟在胳肢窝里，掌着舵。他看得见鱼，他只消看看自己的双手，感觉到背脊靠在船梢上，就能知道这是确实发生的事儿，不是一场梦。有一个时期，眼看事情要告吹了，他感到非常难受，以为这也许是一场梦。等他后来看到鱼跃出水面，在落下前一动不动地悬在半空中的那一刹那，他确信此中准有什么莫大的奥秘，使他无法相信。当时他看不大清楚，尽管眼下他又象往常那样看得很清楚了。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　Now he knew there was the fish and his hands and back were no dream. The hands cure quickly, he thought. I bled them clean and the salt water will heal them. The dark water of the true gulf is the greatest healer that there is. All I must do is keep the head clear. The hands have done their work and we sail well. With his mouth shut and his tail straight up and down we sail like brothers. Then his head started to become a little unclear and he thought, is he bringing me in or am I bringing him in? If I were towing him behind there would be no question. Nor if the fish were in the skiff, with all dignity gone, there would be no question either. But they were sailing together lashed side by side and the old man thought, let him bring me in if it pleases him . I am only better than him through trickery and he meant me no harm.
</div> 
<div>
 　　现在他知道这鱼就在这里，他的双手和背脊都不是梦中的东西。这双手很快就会痊愈的，他想。它们出血出得很多，海水会把它们治好的。这真正的海湾中的深暗的水是世上最佳的治疗剂。我只消保持头脑清醒就行。这两只手已经尽了自己的本份，我们航行得很好。鱼闭着嘴，尾巴直上直下地竖着，我们象亲兄弟一样航行着。接着他的头脑有点儿不清楚了，他竟然想起，是它在带我回家，还是我在带它回家呢？如果我把它拖在船后，那就毫无疑问了。如果这鱼丢尽了面子，给放在这小船上，那么也不会有什么疑问。可是他们是并排地拴在一起航行的，所以老人想，只要它高兴，让它把我带回家去得了。我不过靠了诡计才比它强的，可它对我并无恶意。
</div> 
<div>
 　　
</div> 
<div>
 　　They sailed well and the old man soaked his hands in the salt water and tried to keep his head clear. There were high cumulus clouds and enough cirrus above them so that the old man knew the breeze would last all night. The old man looked at the fish constantly to make sure it was true. It was an hour before the first shark hit him.
</div> 
<div>
 　　他们航行得很好，老人把手浸在盐水里，努力保持头脑清醒。积云堆聚得很高，上空还有相当多的卷云，因此老人看出这风将刮上整整一夜。老人时常对鱼望望，好确定真有这么回事。这时候是第一条鲨鱼来袭击它的前一个钟点。
