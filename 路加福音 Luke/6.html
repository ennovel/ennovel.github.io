<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now it came about that on the Sabbath he was going through the fields of grain, and his disciples took the heads of the grain for food, crushing them in their hands.
<br>6:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 几 个 法 利 赛 人 说 ， 你 们 为 什 么 作 安 息 日 不 可 作 的 事 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But some of the Pharisees said, Why do you do what it is not right to do on the Sabbath?
<br>6:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 经 上 记 着 大 卫 和 跟 从 他 的 人 ， 饥 饿 之 时 所 作 的 事 ， 连 这 个 你 们 也 没 有 念 过 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus said, Have you not seen in the Writings what David did when he was in need of food, he, and those who were with him;
<br>6:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 怎 么 进 了 神 的 殿 ， 拿 陈 设 饼 吃 ， 又 给 跟 从 的 人 吃 。 这 饼 除 了 祭 司 以 外 ， 别 人 都 不 可 吃 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;How he went into the house of God and took for food the holy bread, which only the priests may take, and gave it to those who were with him?
<br>6:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 对 他 们 说 ， 人 子 是 安 息 日 的 主 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said, The Son of man is lord even of the Sabbath.
<br>6:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 有 一 个 安 息 日 ， 耶 稣 进 了 会 堂 教 训 人 。 在 那 里 有 一 个 人 右 手 枯 干 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And it came about, on another Sabbath, that he went into the Synagogue and was teaching there. And a man was there whose right hand was dead.
<br>6:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;文 士 和 法 利 赛 人 窥 探 耶 稣 ， 在 安 息 日 治 病 不 治 病 。 要 得 把 柄 去 告 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the scribes and Pharisees were watching him to see if he would make him well on the Sabbath, so that they might be able to say something against him.
<br>6:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 却 知 道 他 们 的 意 念 。 就 对 那 枯 干 一 只 手 的 人 说 ， 起 来 ， 站 在 当 中 。 那 人 就 起 来 站 着 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But he had knowledge of their thoughts; and he said to the man whose hand was dead, Get up and come into the middle. And he got up and came forward.
<br>6:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 我 问 你 们 ， 在 安 息 日 行 善 行 恶 ， 救 命 害 命 ， 那 样 是 可 以 的 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus said, I put the question to you, Is it right to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil? to give life or to take it away?
<br>6:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 就 周 围 看 着 他 们 众 人 ， 对 那 人 说 ， 伸 出 手 来 。 他 把 手 一 伸 ， 手 就 复 了 原 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And looking round on all of them, he said to him, Put out your hand. And he did so: and his hand was made well.
<br>6:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 就 满 心 大 怒 ， 彼 此 商 议 ， 怎 样 处 治 耶 稣 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But they were full of wrath, and were talking together about what they might do to Jesus.
<br>6:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 时 耶 稣 出 去 上 山 祷 告 。 整 夜 祷 告 神 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And it came about in those days that he went out to the mountain for prayer; and he was all night in prayer to God.
<br>6:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;到 了 天 亮 ， 叫 他 的 门 徒 来 。 就 从 他 们 中 间 挑 选 十 二 个 人 ， 称 他 们 为 使 徒 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the day came and, turning to his disciples, he made a selection from among them of twelve, to whom he gave the name of Apostles;
<br>6:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 十 二 个 人 有 西 门 ， 耶 稣 又 给 他 起 名 叫 彼 得 ， 还 有 他 兄 弟 安 得 烈 ， 又 有 雅 各 和 约 翰 ， 腓 力 和 巴 多 罗 买 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Simon, to whom he gave the name of Peter, and Andrew, his brother, and James and John and Philip and Bartholomew
<br>6:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;马 太 和 多 马 ， 亚 勒 腓 的 儿 子 雅 各 ， 和 奋 锐 党 的 西 门 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Matthew and Thomas and James, the son of Alphaeus, and Simon, who was named the Zealot,
<br>6:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;雅 各 的 儿 子 犹 大 ， （ 儿 子 或 作 兄 弟 ） 和 卖 主 的 加 略 人 犹 大 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Judas, the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, he who was false to him.
<br>6:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 和 他 们 下 了 山 ， 站 在 一 块 平 地 上 。 同 站 的 有 许 多 门 徒 ， 又 有 许 多 百 姓 ， 从 犹 太 全 地 ， 和 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 并 推 罗 西 顿 的 海 边 来 。 都 要 听 他 讲 道 ， 又 指 望 医 治 他 们 的 病 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he came down with them to a level place, and a great band of his disciples, and a very great number of people from all Judaea and Jerusalem and from the parts of Tyre and Sidon by the sea, came to give hearing to him, and to be made well from their diseases;
<br>6:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;还 有 被 污 鬼 缠 磨 的 ， 也 得 了 医 治 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And those who were troubled with unclean spirits were made well.
<br>6:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 都 想 要 摸 他 。 因 为 有 能 力 从 他 身 上 发 出 来 ， 医 好 了 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And all the people were desiring to be touched by him, for power came from him and made them all well.
<br>6:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 举 目 看 着 门 徒 说 ， 你 们 贫 穷 的 人 有 福 了 。 因 为 神 的 国 是 你 们 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And turning his eyes to his disciples he said, Happy are you who are poor: for the kingdom of God is yours.
<br>6:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 饥 饿 的 人 有 福 了 。 因 为 你 们 将 要 饱 足 。 你 们 哀 哭 的 人 有 福 了 。 因 为 你 们 将 要 喜 笑 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Happy are you who are in need of food now: for you will be made full. Happy are you who are weeping now; for you will be glad.
<br>6:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;人 为 人 子 恨 恶 你 们 ， 拒 绝 你 们 ， 辱 骂 你 们 ， 弃 掉 你 们 的 名 ， 以 为 是 恶 ， 你 们 就 有 福 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Happy are you, when men have hate for you, and put you away from among them and say angry words to you, turning away in disgust at your name, because of the Son of man.
<br>6:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;当 那 日 你 们 要 欢 喜 跳 跃 。 因 为 你 们 在 天 上 的 赏 赐 是 大 的 。 他 们 的 祖 宗 待 先 知 也 是 这 样 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Be glad in that day, and be lifted up for joy, for your reward in heaven will be great: for their fathers did these same things to the prophets.
<br>6:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 你 们 富 足 的 人 有 祸 了 。 因 为 你 们 受 过 你 们 的 安 慰 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But unhappy are you who have wealth: for you have been comforted now.
<br>6:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 饱 足 的 人 有 祸 了 。 因 为 你 们 将 要 饥 饿 。 你 们 喜 笑 的 人 有 祸 了 。 因 为 你 们 将 要 哀 恸 哭 泣 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Unhappy are you who are full of food now: for you will be in need. Unhappy are you who are laughing now: for you will be crying in sorrow.
<br>6:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;人 都 说 你 们 好 的 时 候 ， 你 们 就 有 祸 了 。 因 为 他 们 的 祖 宗 待 假 先 知 也 是 这 样 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Unhappy are you when all men give you their approval: for so their fathers did to the false prophets.
<br>6:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;只 是 我 告 诉 你 们 这 听 道 的 人 ， 你 们 的 仇 敌 要 爱 他 ， 恨 你 们 的 要 待 他 好 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But I say to you who give ear to me, Have love for those who are against you, do good to those who have hate for you,
<br>6:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;咒 诅 你 们 的 要 为 他 祝 福 ， 凌 辱 你 们 的 要 为 他 祷 告 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Give blessing to those who give you curses, say prayers for those who are cruel to you.
<br>6:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 人 打 你 这 边 的 脸 ， 连 那 边 的 脸 也 由 他 打 。 有 人 夺 你 的 外 衣 ， 连 里 衣 也 由 他 拿 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;If a man gives you a blow on one side of your face, then let the other side be turned to him; from him who takes away your coat, do not keep back your robe.
<br>6:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;凡 求 你 的 ， 就 给 他 。 有 人 夺 你 的 东 西 去 ， 不 用 再 要 回 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Give to everyone who comes with a request, and if a man takes away your property, make no attempt to get it back again.
<br>6:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 愿 意 人 怎 样 待 你 们 ， 你 们 也 要 怎 样 待 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Do to others as you would have them do to you.
<br>6:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 若 单 爱 那 爱 你 们 的 人 ， 有 什 么 可 酬 谢 的 呢 ？ 就 是 罪 人 也 爱 那 爱 他 们 的 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;If you have love for those who have love for you, what credit is it to you? for even sinners have love for those who have love for them.
<br>6:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 若 善 待 那 善 待 你 们 的 人 ， 有 什 么 可 酬 谢 的 呢 ？ 就 是 罪 人 也 是 这 样 行 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is it to you? for even sinners do the same.
<br>6:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 若 借 给 人 ， 指 望 从 他 收 回 ， 有 什 么 可 酬 谢 的 呢 ？ 就 是 罪 人 也 借 给 罪 人 ， 要 如 数 收 回 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And if you let those have the use of your money, from whom you are hoping to get it back, what credit is it to you? even sinners do so to sinners, hoping to get back as much as they gave.
<br>6:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 倒 要 爱 仇 敌 ， 也 要 善 待 他 们 ， 并 要 借 给 人 不 指 望 偿 还 。 你 们 的 赏 赐 就 必 大 了 ， 你 们 也 必 作 至 高 者 的 儿 子 。 因 为 他 恩 待 那 忘 恩 的 和 作 恶 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But be loving to those who are against you and do them good, and give them your money, not giving up hope, and your reward will be great and you will be the sons of the Most High: for he is kind to evil men, and to those who have hard hearts.
<br>6:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 要 慈 悲 ， 象 你 们 的 父 慈 悲 一 样 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Be full of pity, even as your Father is full of pity.
<br>6:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 不 要 论 断 人 ， 就 不 被 论 断 。 你 们 不 要 定 人 的 罪 ， 就 不 被 定 罪 。 你 们 要 饶 恕 人 ， 就 必 蒙 饶 恕 。 （ 饶 恕 原 文 作 释 放 ）
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Be not judges of others, and you will not be judged: do not give punishment to others, and you will not get punishment yourselves: make others free, and you will be made free:
<br>6:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 要 给 人 ， 就 必 有 给 你 们 的 。 并 且 用 十 足 的 升 斗 ， 连 摇 带 按 ， 上 尖 下 流 的 ， 倒 在 你 们 怀 里 。 因 为 你 们 用 什 么 量 器 量 给 人 ， 也 必 用 什 么 量 器 量 给 你 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Give, and it will be given to you; good measure, crushed down, full and running over, they will give to you. For in the same measure as you give, it will be given to you again.
<br>6:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 又 用 比 喻 对 他 们 说 ， 瞎 子 岂 能 领 瞎 子 ， 两 个 人 不 是 都 要 掉 在 坑 里 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he gave them teaching in the form of a story, saying, Is it possible for one blind man to be guide to another? will they not go falling together into a hole?
<br>6:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;学 生 不 能 高 过 先 生 。 凡 学 成 了 的 不 过 和 先 生 一 样 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The disciple is not greater than his master, but everyone whose learning is complete will be like his master.
<br>6:41&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;为 什 么 看 见 你 弟 兄 眼 中 有 刺 ， 却 不 想 自 己 眼 中 有 梁 木 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And why do you take note of the grain of dust in your brother's eye, but take no note of the bit of wood which is in your eye?
<br>6:42&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 不 见 自 己 眼 中 有 梁 木 。 怎 能 对 你 弟 兄 说 ， 容 我 去 掉 你 眼 中 的 刺 呢 ？ 你 这 假 冒 为 善 的 人 ， 先 去 掉 自 己 眼 中 的 梁 木 ， 然 后 才 能 看 得 清 楚 ， 去 掉 你 弟 兄 眼 中 的 刺 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;How will you say to your brother, Brother, let me take the grain of dust out of your eye, when you yourself do not see the bit of wood in your eye? O false one! first take the wood out of your eye and then you will see clearly to take the dust out of your brother's eye.
<br>6:43&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 没 有 好 树 结 坏 果 子 。 也 没 有 坏 树 结 好 果 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For no good tree gives bad fruit, and no bad tree gives good fruit.
<br>6:44&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;凡 树 木 看 果 子 ， 就 可 以 认 出 他 来 。 人 不 是 从 荆 棘 上 摘 无 花 果 ， 也 不 是 从 蒺 藜 里 摘 葡 萄 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For every tree is judged by its fruit. Men do not get figs from thorns, or grapes from blackberry plants.
<br>6:45&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;善 人 从 他 心 里 所 存 的 善 ， 就 发 出 善 来 。 恶 人 从 他 心 里 所 存 的 恶 ， 就 发 出 恶 来 。 因 为 心 里 所 充 满 的 ， 口 里 就 说 出 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The good man, out of the good store of his heart, gives good things; and the evil man, out of his evil store, gives evil: for out of the full store of the heart come the words of the mouth.
<br>6:46&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 为 什 么 称 呼 我 主 阿 ， 主 阿 ， 却 不 遵 我 的 话 行 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Why do you say to me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?
<br>6:47&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;凡 到 我 这 里 来 ， 听 见 我 的 话 就 去 行 的 ， 我 要 告 诉 你 们 他 像 什 么 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Everyone who comes to me and gives ear to my words and does them, I will make clear to you what he is like:
<br>6:48&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 像 一 个 人 盖 房 子 ， 深 深 地 挖 地 ， 把 根 基 安 在 磐 石 上 。 到 发 大 水 的 时 候 ， 水 冲 那 房 子 ， 房 子 总 不 能 摇 动 。 因 为 根 基 立 在 磐 石 上 。 有 古 卷 作 因 为 盖 造 得 好
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He is like a man building a house, who went deep and put the base of it on a rock; and when the water came up and the river was driving against that house, it was not moved, because the building was good.
<br>6:49&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;惟 有 听 见 不 去 行 的 ， 就 像 一 个 人 在 土 地 上 盖 房 子 ， 没 有 根 基 。 水 一 冲 ， 随 即 倒 塌 了 ， 并 且 那 房 子 坏 得 很 大 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But he who gives hearing, without doing, is like a man building a house on the earth without a base for it; and when the force of the river came against it, straight away it came down; and the destruction of that house was great.
