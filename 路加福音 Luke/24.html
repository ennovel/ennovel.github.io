<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But on the first day of the week, at dawn, they came to the place where his body had been put, taking the spices which they had got ready.
<br>24:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;看 见 石 头 已 经 从 坟 墓 滚 开 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they saw that the stone had been rolled away.
<br>24:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;她 们 就 进 去 ， 只 是 不 见 主 耶 稣 的 身 体 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they went in, but the body of the Lord Jesus was not there.
<br>24:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;正 在 猜 疑 之 间 ， 忽 然 有 两 个 人 站 在 旁 边 。 衣 服 放 光 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And while they were in doubt about it, they saw two men in shining clothing by them:
<br>24:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;妇 女 们 惊 怕 ， 将 脸 伏 地 。 那 两 个 人 就 对 她 们 说 ， 为 什 么 在 死 人 中 找 活 人 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And while their faces were bent down to the earth in fear, these said to them, Why are you looking for the living among the dead?
<br>24:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 不 在 这 里 ， 已 经 复 活 了 。 当 记 念 他 还 在 加 利 利 的 时 候 ， 怎 样 告 诉 你 们 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He is not here, he has come back to life: have in mind what he said to you when he was still in Galilee, saying,
<br>24:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;说 ， 人 子 必 须 被 交 在 罪 人 手 里 ， 钉 在 十 字 架 上 ， 第 三 日 复 活 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The Son of man will be given up into the hands of evil-doers, and be put to death on the cross, and on the third day he will come back to life.
<br>24:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;她 们 就 想 起 耶 稣 的 话 来 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they remembered his words,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And his words came back into their minds,
<br>24:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;便 从 坟 墓 那 里 回 去 ， 把 这 一 切 事 告 诉 十 一 个 使 徒 和 其 余 的 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they went away from that place and gave an account of all these things to the eleven disciples and all the others.
<br>24:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 告 诉 使 徒 的 ， 就 是 抹 大 拉 的 马 利 亚 ， 和 约 亚 拿 ， 并 雅 各 的 母 亲 马 利 亚 ， 还 有 与 她 们 在 一 处 的 妇 女 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary, the mother of James: and the other women with them said these things to the Apostles.
<br>24:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;她 们 这 些 话 ， 使 徒 以 为 是 胡 言 ， 就 不 相 信 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But these words seemed foolish to them, and they had no belief in them.
<br>24:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 起 来 ， 跑 到 坟 墓 前 ， 低 头 往 里 看 ， 见 细 麻 布 独 在 一 处 ， 就 回 去 了 ， 心 里 希 奇 所 成 的 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Peter got up and went to the place where the body had been put, and looking in he saw nothing but the linen cloths, and he went to his house full of wonder at what had taken place.
<br>24:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;正 当 那 日 ， 门 徒 中 有 两 个 人 往 一 个 村 子 去 ， 这 村 子 名 叫 以 马 忤 斯 ， 离 耶 路 撒 冷 约 有 二 十 五 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And then, two of them, on that very day, were going to a little town named Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem.
<br>24:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 彼 此 谈 论 所 遇 见 的 这 一 切 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they were talking together about all those things which had taken place.
<br>24:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;正 谈 论 相 问 的 时 候 ， 耶 稣 亲 自 就 近 他 们 ， 和 他 们 同 行 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And while they were talking and questioning together, Jesus himself came near and went with them.
<br>24:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;只 是 他 们 的 眼 睛 迷 糊 了 ， 不 认 识 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But their eyes were not open that they might have knowledge of him.
<br>24:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 走 路 彼 此 谈 论 的 是 什 么 事 呢 ？ 他 们 就 站 住 ， 脸 上 带 着 愁 容 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, What are you talking about together while you go?
<br>24:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;二 人 中 有 一 个 名 叫 革 流 巴 的 ， 回 答 说 ， 你 在 耶 路 撒 冷 作 客 ， 还 不 知 道 这 几 天 在 那 里 所 出 的 事 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then stopping, and looking sadly at him, one of them, named Cleopas, said to him, Are you the only man living in Jerusalem who has not had news of the things which have taken place there at this time?
<br>24:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 什 么 事 呢 ？ 他 们 说 ， 就 是 拿 撒 勒 人 耶 稣 的 事 。 他 是 个 先 知 ， 在 神 和 众 百 姓 面 前 ， 说 话 行 事 都 有 大 能 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, What things? And they said, The things to do with Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet, great in his acts and his words, before God and all the people:
<br>24:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;祭 司 长 和 我 们 的 官 府 ， 竟 把 他 解 去 定 了 死 罪 ， 钉 在 十 字 架 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And how the chief priests and our rulers gave him up to be put to death on the cross.
<br>24:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 我 们 素 来 所 盼 望 要 赎 以 色 列 民 的 就 是 他 。 不 但 如 此 ， 而 且 这 事 成 就 ， 现 在 已 经 三 天 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But we were hoping that he would be the Saviour of Israel. In addition to all this he has now let three days go by from the time when these things took place;
<br>24:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;再 者 ， 我 们 中 间 有 几 个 妇 女 使 我 们 惊 奇 ， 她 们 清 早 到 了 坟 墓 那 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And certain women among us gave us cause for wonder, for they went early to the place where his body had been put,
<br>24:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;不 见 他 的 身 体 ， 就 回 来 告 诉 我 们 说 ， 看 见 了 天 使 显 现 ， 说 他 活 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And it was not there; then they came saying that they had seen a vision of angels who said that he was living.
<br>24:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 有 我 们 的 几 个 人 ， 往 坟 墓 那 里 去 ， 所 遇 见 的 ， 正 如 妇 女 们 所 说 的 ， 只 是 没 有 看 见 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And some of those who were with us went to the place, and saw that it was as the women had said, but him they did not see.
<br>24:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 无 知 的 人 哪 ， 先 知 所 说 的 一 切 话 ， 你 们 的 心 ， 信 得 太 迟 钝 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said, O foolish men! how slow you are to give belief to what the prophets have said.
<br>24:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;基 督 这 样 受 害 ， 又 进 入 他 的 荣 耀 ， 岂 不 是 应 当 的 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Was it not necessary for the Christ to go through these things, and to come into his glory?
<br>24:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 从 摩 西 和 众 先 知 起 ， 凡 经 上 所 指 着 自 己 的 话 ， 都 给 他 们 讲 解 明 白 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he made clear to them all the things in the Writings, from Moses and from all the prophets, which had to do with himself.
<br>24:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;将 近 他 们 所 去 的 村 子 ， 耶 稣 好 像 还 要 往 前 行
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they came near the town to which they were going, and he seemed as if he was going on;
<br>24:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 却 强 留 他 说 ， 时 候 晚 了 ， 日 头 已 经 平 西 了 ， 请 你 同 我 们 住 下 吧 。 耶 稣 就 进 去 ， 要 同 他 们 住 下 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But they kept him back, saying, Do not go, for evening is near, the day is almost gone. And he went in with them.
<br>24:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;到 了 坐 席 的 时 候 ， 耶 稣 拿 起 饼 来 ， 祝 谢 了 ， 掰 开 ， 递 给 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he was seated with them at table, he took the bread, and said words of blessing and, making division of it, he gave it to them.
<br>24:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 的 眼 睛 明 亮 了 ， 这 才 认 出 他 来 。 忽 然 耶 稣 不 见 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And then their eyes were open, and they had knowledge of him, but he went from their view.
<br>24:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 彼 此 说 ， 在 路 上 ， 他 和 我 们 说 话 ， 给 我 们 讲 解 圣 经 的 时 候 ， 我 们 的 心 岂 不 是 火 热 的 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they said to one another, Were not our hearts burning in us while he was talking to us on the way, making clear to us the holy Writings?
<br>24:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 就 立 时 起 身 ， 回 耶 路 撒 冷 去 ， 正 遇 见 十 一 个 使 徒 ， 和 他 们 的 同 人 ， 聚 集 在 一 处 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And that very hour they got up and went back to Jerusalem, where the eleven and the others had come together.
<br>24:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;说 ， 主 果 然 复 活 ， 已 经 现 给 西 门 看 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they said to them, The Lord has truly come back to life again, and Simon has seen him.
<br>24:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;两 个 人 就 把 路 上 所 遇 见 ， 和 掰 饼 的 时 候 怎 么 被 他 们 认 出 来 的 事 ， 都 述 说 了 一 遍 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they gave an account of the things which had taken place on the way, and how, when he gave them bread, they had knowledge of him.
<br>24:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;正 说 这 话 的 时 候 ， 耶 稣 亲 自 站 在 他 们 当 中 ， 说 ， 愿 你 们 平 安 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And while they were saying these things, he himself was among them, and said to them, Peace be with you!
<br>24:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 却 惊 慌 害 怕 ， 以 为 所 看 见 的 是 魂 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But they were full of fear, being of the opinion that they were seeing a spirit.
<br>24:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 你 们 为 什 么 愁 烦 ？ 为 什 么 心 里 起 疑 念 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, Why are you troubled, and why are your hearts full of doubt?
<br>24:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 看 我 的 手 ， 我 的 脚 ， 就 知 道 实 在 是 我 了 。 摸 我 看 看 。 魂 无 骨 无 肉 ， 你 们 看 我 是 有 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;See; my hands and my feet: it is I myself; put your hands on me and make certain; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have.
<br>24:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;说 了 这 话 ， 就 把 手 和 脚 给 他 们 看 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he had said this, he let them see his hands and his feet.
<br>24:41&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 正 喜 得 不 敢 信 ， 并 且 希 奇 ， 耶 稣 就 说 ， 你 们 这 里 有 什 么 吃 的 没 有 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And because, for joy and wonder, they were still in doubt, he said to them, Have you any food here?
<br>24:42&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 便 给 他 一 片 烧 鱼 。 （ 有 古 卷 在 此 有 和 一 块 蜜 房 ）
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they gave him a bit of cooked fish.
<br>24:43&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 接 过 来 ， 在 他 们 面 前 吃 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he took it, and did eat before them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And before their eyes he took a meal.
<br>24:44&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 这 就 是 我 从 前 与 你 们 同 在 之 时 ， 所 告 诉 你 们 的 话 ， 说 ， 摩 西 的 律 法 ， 先 知 的 书 ， 和 诗 篇 上 所 记 的 ， 凡 指 着 我 的 话 ， 都 必 须 应 验 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, These are the words which I said to you when I was still with you, how it was necessary for all the things which are in the writings of Moses and the prophets and in the Psalms about me, to be put into effect.
<br>24:45&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 耶 稣 开 他 们 的 心 窍 ， 使 他 们 能 明 白 圣 经 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then he made the holy Writings clear to their minds.
<br>24:46&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 对 他 们 说 ， 照 经 上 所 写 的 ， 基 督 必 受 害 ， 第 三 日 从 死 里 复 活 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, So it is in the Writings that the Christ would undergo death, and come back to life again on the third day;
<br>24:47&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;并 且 人 要 奉 他 的 名 传 悔 改 赦 罪 的 道 ， 从 耶 路 撒 冷 起 直 传 到 万 邦 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And that teaching about a change of heart and forgiveness of sins is to be given to Jerusalem first and to all nations in his name.
<br>24:48&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 就 是 这 些 事 的 见 证 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And ye are witnesses of these things.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;You are witnesses of these things.
<br>24:49&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 要 将 我 父 所 应 许 的 降 在 你 们 身 上 。 你 们 要 在 城 里 等 候 ， 直 到 你 们 领 受 从 上 头 来 的 能 力 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And now I will send to you what my father has undertaken to give you, but do not go from the town, till the power from heaven comes to you.
<br>24:50&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 领 他 们 到 伯 大 尼 的 对 面 ， 就 举 手 给 他 们 祝 福 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he took them out till they were near Bethany, and lifting up his hands, he gave them a blessing.
<br>24:51&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;正 祝 福 的 时 候 ， 他 就 离 开 他 们 ， 被 带 到 天 上 去 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And while he was doing so, he went from them and was taken up into heaven.
<br>24:52&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 就 拜 他 ， 大 大 地 欢 喜 ， 回 耶 路 撒 冷 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they gave him worship and went back to Jerusalem with great joy.
<br>24:53&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;常 在 殿 里 称 颂 神 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
