<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And it came about, after a short time, that he went through town and country giving the good news of the kingdom of God, and with him were the twelve,
<br>8:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;还 有 被 恶 鬼 所 附 ， 被 疾 病 所 累 ， 已 经 治 好 的 几 个 妇 女 ， 内 中 有 称 为 抹 大 拉 的 马 利 亚 ， 曾 有 七 个 鬼 从 她 身 上 赶 出 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And certain women who had been made free from evil spirits and diseases, Mary named Magdalene, from whom seven evil spirits had gone out,
<br>8:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 有 希 律 的 家 宰 苦 撒 的 妻 子 约 亚 拿 ， 并 苏 撒 拿 ， 和 好 些 别 的 妇 女 ， 都 是 用 自 己 的 财 物 供 给 耶 稣 和 门 徒 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's chief house-servant, and Susanna and a number of others, who gave him of their wealth for his needs.
<br>8:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;当 许 多 人 聚 集 ， 又 有 人 从 各 城 里 出 来 见 耶 稣 的 时 候 ， 耶 稣 就 用 比 喻 说 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when a great number of people came together, and men from every town went out to him, he gave them teaching in the form of a story:
<br>8:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 一 个 撒 种 的 出 去 撒 种 。 撒 的 时 候 ， 有 落 在 路 旁 的 ， 被 人 践 踏 ， 天 上 的 飞 鸟 又 来 吃 尽 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;A man went out to put in seed, and while he was doing it, some was dropped by the wayside and it was crushed under foot, and was taken by the birds of heaven.
<br>8:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 落 在 磐 石 上 的 ， 一 出 来 就 枯 干 了 ， 因 为 得 不 着 滋 润 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And some went on the rock, and when it came up it became dry and dead because it had no water.
<br>8:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 落 在 荆 棘 里 的 ， 荆 棘 一 同 生 长 ， 把 它 挤 住 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And some went among thorns, and the thorns came up with it and it had no room for growth.
<br>8:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 有 落 在 好 土 里 的 ， 生 长 起 来 ， 结 实 百 倍 。 耶 稣 说 了 这 些 话 ， 就 大 声 说 ， 有 耳 可 听 的 ， 就 应 当 听 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And some falling on good earth, came up and gave fruit a hundred times as much. And with these words he said in a loud voice, He who has ears, let him give ear.
<br>8:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;门 徒 问 耶 稣 说 ， 这 比 喻 是 什 么 意 思 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And his disciples put questions to him about the point of the story.
<br>8:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 说 ， 神 国 的 奥 秘 ， 只 叫 你 们 知 道 。 至 于 别 人 ， 就 用 比 喻 ， 叫 他 们 看 也 看 不 见 ， 听 也 听 不 明 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said, To you is given knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God; but to the others, they are given in stories, so that seeing, they may not see, and though they give hearing, the sense will not be clear to them.
<br>8:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 比 喻 乃 是 这 样 。 种 子 就 是 神 的 道 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now this is the point of the story: The seed is the word of God.
<br>8:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 些 在 路 旁 的 ， 就 是 人 听 了 道 ， 随 后 魔 鬼 来 ， 从 他 们 心 里 把 道 夺 去 ， 恐 怕 他 们 信 了 得 救 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Those by the side of the road are those who have given hearing; then the Evil One comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not have faith and get salvation.
<br>8:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 些 在 磐 石 上 的 ， 就 是 人 听 道 ， 欢 喜 领 受 ， 但 心 中 没 有 根 ， 不 过 暂 时 相 信 ， 及 至 遇 见 试 炼 就 退 后 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And those on the rock are those who with joy give hearing to the word; but having no root, they have faith for a time, and when the test comes they give up.
<br>8:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 落 在 荆 棘 里 的 ， 就 是 人 听 了 道 ， 走 开 以 后 ， 被 今 生 的 思 虑 钱 财 宴 乐 挤 住 了 ， 便 结 不 出 成 熟 的 子 粒 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And those which went among thorns are those who have given hearing, and go on their way, but they are overcome by cares and wealth and the pleasures of life, and they give no fruit.
<br>8:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 落 在 好 土 里 的 ， 就 是 人 听 了 道 ， 持 守 在 诚 实 善 良 的 心 里 ， 并 且 忍 耐 着 结 实 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And those in the good earth are those who, having given ear to the word, keep it with a good and true heart, and in quiet strength give fruit.
<br>8:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;没 有 人 点 灯 用 器 皿 盖 上 ， 或 放 在 床 底 下 ， 乃 是 放 在 灯 台 上 ， 叫 进 来 的 人 看 见 亮 光 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;No man, when the light is lighted, puts a cover over it, or puts it under a bed, but he puts it on its table, so that those who come in may see the light.
<br>8:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 掩 藏 的 事 ， 没 有 不 显 出 来 的 。 隐 瞒 的 事 ， 没 有 不 露 出 来 被 人 知 道 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For nothing is put out of view which will not be made clear, and nothing is secret of which the knowledge will not come to light.
<br>8:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;所 以 你 们 应 当 小 心 怎 样 听 。 因 为 凡 有 的 ， 还 要 加 给 他 。 凡 没 有 的 ， 连 他 自 以 为 有 的 ， 也 要 夺 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So take care how you give hearing, for to him who has will be given, and from him who has not will be taken even what he seems to have.
<br>8:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 的 母 亲 和 他 弟 兄 来 了 ， 因 为 人 多 ， 不 得 到 他 跟 前 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And his mother and his brothers came to him, and they were not able to get near him because of the great number of people.
<br>8:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 人 告 诉 他 说 ， 你 母 亲 和 你 弟 兄 ， 站 在 外 边 ， 要 见 你 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And someone said to him, Your mother and your brothers are outside desiring to see you.
<br>8:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 听 了 神 之 道 而 遵 行 的 人 ， 就 是 我 的 母 亲 ， 我 的 弟 兄 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But he said to them in answer, My mother and my brothers are those who have knowledge of the word of God and do it.
<br>8:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 一 天 耶 稣 和 门 徒 上 了 船 ， 对 门 徒 说 ， 我 们 可 以 渡 到 湖 那 边 去 。 他 们 就 开 了 船 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now it came about on one of those days that he got into a boat with his disciples; and he said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the water: and they put out the boat.
<br>8:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;正 行 的 时 候 ， 耶 稣 睡 着 了 。 湖 上 忽 然 起 了 暴 风 ， 船 将 满 了 水 ， 甚 是 危 险 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But while they were sailing he went to sleep: and a storm of wind came down on the sea, and the boat became full of water and they were in danger.
<br>8:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;门 徒 来 叫 醒 了 他 ， 说 ， 夫 子 ， 夫 子 ， 我 们 丧 命 啦 。 耶 稣 醒 了 ， 斥 责 那 狂 风 大 浪 。 风 浪 就 止 住 ， 平 静 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then they came to him and, awaking him out of his sleep, said, Master, Master, destruction is near. And he, when he was awake, gave orders to the wind and the rolling waves, and the storm came to an end, and all was calm.
<br>8:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 的 信 心 在 哪 里 呢 ？ 他 们 又 惧 怕 ， 又 希 奇 ， 彼 此 说 ， 这 到 底 是 谁 ？ 他 吩 咐 风 和 水 ， 连 风 和 水 也 听 从 他 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, Where is your faith? And fear and wonder overcame them, and they said to one another, Who then is this, who gives orders even to the winds and the water and they do what he says?
<br>8:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 到 了 格 拉 森 有 古 卷 作 加 大 拉 人 的 地 方 ， 就 是 加 利 利 的 对 面 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they came to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.
<br>8:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 上 了 岸 ， 就 有 城 里 一 个 被 鬼 附 着 的 人 ， 迎 面 而 来 ， 这 个 人 许 久 不 穿 衣 服 ， 不 住 房 子 ， 只 住 在 坟 茔 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he had come to the land, there came to him a certain man from the town who had evil spirits; and for a long time he had had no clothing on, and was not living in a house but in the place of the dead.
<br>8:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 见 了 耶 稣 ， 就 俯 伏 在 他 面 前 ， 大 声 喊 叫 ， 说 ， 至 高 神 的 儿 子 耶 稣 ， 我 与 你 有 什 么 相 干 。 求 你 不 要 叫 我 受 苦 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he saw Jesus, he gave a loud cry and went down on the earth before him and in a loud voice said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Do not be cruel to me.
<br>8:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;是 因 耶 稣 曾 吩 咐 污 鬼 从 那 人 身 上 出 来 。 原 来 这 鬼 屡 次 抓 住 他 ， 他 常 被 人 看 守 ， 又 被 铁 链 和 脚 镣 捆 锁 ， 他 竟 把 锁 链 挣 断 ， 被 鬼 赶 到 旷 野 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For he gave an order to the evil spirit to come out of the man. For frequently it would take a grip of him: and he was kept under control, and prisoned with chains; but parting the chains in two, he would be sent by the driving of the evil spirit into waste places.
<br>8:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 问 他 说 ， 你 名 叫 什 么 。 他 说 ， 我 名 叫 群 。 这 是 因 为 附 着 他 的 鬼 多 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus said to him, What is your name? And he said, Legion; for a number of spirits had gone into him.
<br>8:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;鬼 就 央 求 耶 稣 ， 不 要 吩 咐 他 们 到 无 底 坑 里 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they made a request to him that he would not give them an order to go away into the deep.
<br>8:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 里 有 一 大 群 猪 ， 在 山 上 吃 食 。 鬼 央 求 耶 稣 ， 准 他 们 进 入 猪 里 去 。 耶 稣 准 了 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now there was a great herd of pigs in that place, getting food on the mountain: and the evil spirits made a request to him that he would let them go into the pigs, and he let them.
<br>8:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;鬼 就 从 那 人 出 来 ， 进 入 猪 里 去 。 于 是 那 群 猪 闯 下 山 崖 ， 投 在 湖 里 淹 死 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the evil spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs: and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the water and came to destruction.
<br>8:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;放 猪 的 看 见 这 事 就 逃 跑 了 ， 去 告 诉 城 里 和 乡 下 的 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the men who took care of them saw what had come about, they went quickly and gave news of it in the town and the country.
<br>8:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 出 来 要 看 是 什 么 事 。 到 了 耶 稣 那 里 ， 看 见 鬼 所 离 开 的 那 人 ， 坐 在 耶 稣 脚 前 ， 穿 着 衣 服 ， 心 里 明 白 过 来 ， 他 们 就 害 怕 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they went out to see what had taken place, and they came to Jesus and saw the man out of whom the evil spirits had gone, seated, clothed and with full use of his senses, at the feet of Jesus; and fear came on them.
<br>8:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;看 见 这 事 的 ， 便 将 被 鬼 附 着 的 人 怎 么 得 救 ， 告 诉 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And those who had seen it gave them an account of how the man who had the evil spirits was made well.
<br>8:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;格 拉 森 四 围 的 人 ， 因 为 害 怕 得 很 ， 都 求 耶 稣 离 开 他 们 。 耶 稣 就 上 船 回 去 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes made a request to him to go away from them; for they were in great fear: and he got into a boat and went back.
<br>8:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;鬼 所 离 开 的 那 人 ， 恳 求 和 耶 稣 同 在 。 耶 稣 却 打 发 他 回 去 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But the man from whom the evil spirits had gone out had a great desire to be with him, but he sent him away, saying,
<br>8:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;说 ， 你 回 家 去 ， 传 说 神 为 你 作 了 何 等 大 的 事 。 他 就 去 满 城 里 传 扬 耶 稣 为 他 作 了 何 等 大 的 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Go back to your house and let them have news of all the great things which God has done for you. And he went away, giving word through all the town of the great things which Jesus had done for him.
<br>8:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 回 来 的 时 候 ， 众 人 迎 接 他 ， 因 为 他 们 都 等 候 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when Jesus went back, the people were glad to see him, for they were all waiting for him.
<br>8:41&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 一 个 管 会 堂 的 ， 名 叫 睚 鲁 ， 来 俯 伏 在 耶 稣 脚 前 ， 求 耶 稣 到 他 家 里 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then there came a man named Jairus, who was a ruler in the Synagogue: and he went down at the feet of Jesus, desiring him to come to his house;
<br>8:42&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 他 有 一 个 独 生 女 儿 ， 约 有 十 二 岁 ， 快 要 死 了 。 耶 稣 去 的 时 候 ， 众 人 拥 挤 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was near to death. But while he was on his way, the people were pushing to be near him.
<br>8:43&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 一 个 女 人 ， 患 了 十 二 年 的 血 漏 ， 在 医 生 手 里 花 尽 了 她 一 切 养 生 的 ， 并 没 有 一 人 能 医 好 她 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And a woman, who had had a flow of blood for twelve years, and had given all her money to medical men, and not one of them was able to make her well,
<br>8:44&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;她 来 到 耶 稣 背 后 ， 摸 他 的 衣 裳 ？ ？ 子 ， 血 漏 立 刻 就 止 住 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Came after him and put her hand on the edge of his robe, and straight away the flowing of her blood was stopped.
<br>8:45&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 摸 我 的 是 谁 。 众 人 都 不 承 认 ， 彼 得 和 同 行 的 人 都 说 ， 夫 子 ， 众 人 拥 拥 挤 挤 紧 靠 着 你 。 有 古 卷 在 此 有 你 还 问 摸 我 的 是 谁 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus said, Who was touching me? And when they all said, It is not I, Peter and those who were with him said, Master, the people are pushing round you on every side.
<br>8:46&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 总 有 人 摸 我 。 因 我 觉 得 有 能 力 从 我 身 上 出 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Jesus said, Someone was touching me, for I had the feeling that power had gone out from me.
<br>8:47&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 女 人 知 道 不 能 隐 藏 ， 就 战 战 兢 兢 地 来 俯 伏 在 耶 稣 脚 前 ， 把 摸 他 的 缘 故 ， 和 怎 样 立 刻 得 好 了 ， 当 着 众 人 都 说 出 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the woman saw that she was not able to keep it secret, she came, shaking with fear, and falling down before him she made clear before all the people the reason for her touching him, and how she was made well straight away.
<br>8:48&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 她 说 ， 女 儿 ， 你 的 信 救 了 你 ， 平 平 安 安 地 去 吧 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.
<br>8:49&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;还 说 话 的 时 候 ， 有 人 从 管 会 堂 的 家 里 来 说 ， 你 的 女 儿 死 了 ， 不 要 劳 动 夫 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;While he was still talking, someone came from the house of the ruler of the Synagogue, saying, Your daughter is dead; do not go on troubling the Master.
<br>8:50&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 听 见 就 对 他 说 ， 不 要 怕 ， 只 要 信 ， 你 的 女 儿 就 必 得 救 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Jesus at these words said to him, Have no fear, only have faith, and she will be made well.
<br>8:51&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 到 了 他 的 家 ， 除 了 彼 得 ， 约 翰 ， 雅 各 ， 和 女 儿 的 父 母 ， 不 许 别 人 同 他 进 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he came to the house he did not let any man go in with him, but only Peter and John and James, and the father of the girl and her mother.
<br>8:52&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 都 为 这 女 儿 哀 哭 捶 胸 。 耶 稣 说 ， 不 要 哭 ， 他 不 是 死 了 ， 是 睡 着 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And all the people were weeping and crying for her; but he said, Do not be sad, for she is not dead, but sleeping.
<br>8:53&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 晓 得 女 儿 已 经 死 了 ， 就 嗤 笑 耶 稣 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they were laughing at him, being certain that she was dead.
<br>8:54&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 拉 着 她 的 手 ， 呼 叫 说 ， 女 儿 ， 起 来 吧 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But he, taking her hand, said to her, My child, get up.
<br>8:55&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;她 的 灵 魂 便 回 来 ， 她 就 立 刻 起 来 了 。 耶 稣 吩 咐 给 她 东 西 吃 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And her spirit came back to her and she got up straight away: and he gave orders that food was to be given to her.
<br>8:56&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;她 的 父 母 惊 奇 得 很 。 耶 稣 嘱 咐 他 们 ， 不 要 把 所 作 的 事 告 诉 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And her father and mother were full of wonder, but he gave orders to them to say nothing about it to anyone.
