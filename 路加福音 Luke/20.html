<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And it came about on one of those days, when he was teaching the people in the Temple and preaching the good news,
<br>20:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;问 他 说 ， 你 告 诉 我 们 ， 你 仗 着 什 么 权 柄 作 这 些 事 ？ 给 你 这 权 柄 的 是 谁 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;That the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people came to him and said, Make clear to us by what authority you do these things and who gave you this authority.
<br>20:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 我 也 要 问 你 们 一 句 话 。 你 们 且 告 诉 我 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And in answer he said to them, I will put a question to you, and do you give me an answer:
<br>20:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;约 翰 的 洗 礼 ， 是 从 天 上 来 的 ？ 是 从 人 间 来 的 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The baptism of John, was it from heaven or of men?
<br>20:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 彼 此 商 议 说 ， 我 们 若 说 从 天 上 来 ， 他 必 说 你 们 为 什 么 不 信 他 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they said among themselves, If we say, From heaven; he will say, Why did you not have faith in him?
<br>20:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;若 说 从 人 间 来 ， 百 姓 都 要 用 石 头 打 死 我 们 。 因 为 他 们 信 约 翰 是 先 知 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But if we say, Of men; we will be stoned by the people, for they are certain that John was a prophet.
<br>20:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 回 答 说 ， 不 知 道 是 从 哪 里 来 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they made answer that they had no idea where it came from.
<br>20:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 我 也 不 告 诉 你 们 ， 我 仗 着 什 么 权 柄 作 这 些 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus said, And I will not make clear to you by what authority I do these things.
<br>20:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 就 设 比 喻 ， 对 百 姓 说 ， 有 人 栽 了 一 个 葡 萄 园 ， 租 给 园 户 ， 就 往 外 国 去 住 了 许 久 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he gave the people this story: A man made a vine-garden and gave the use of it to some field-workers and went into another country for a long time.
<br>20:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;到 了 时 候 ， 打 发 一 个 仆 人 到 园 户 那 里 去 ， 叫 他 们 把 园 中 当 纳 的 果 子 交 给 他 。 园 户 竟 打 了 他 ， 叫 他 空 手 回 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And at the right time he sent a servant to the workers to get part of the fruit from the vines; but the workmen gave him blows and sent him away with nothing.
<br>20:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 打 发 一 个 仆 人 去 。 他 们 也 打 了 他 ， 并 且 凌 辱 他 ， 叫 他 空 手 回 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he sent another servant, and they gave blows to him in the same way, and put shame on him, and sent him away with nothing.
<br>20:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 打 发 第 三 个 仆 人 去 。 他 们 也 打 伤 了 他 ， 把 他 推 出 去 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he sent a third, and they gave him wounds and put him out.
<br>20:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;园 主 说 ， 我 怎 么 办 呢 ？ 我 要 打 发 我 的 爱 子 去 。 或 者 他 们 尊 敬 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the lord of the garden said, What am I to do? I will send my dearly loved son; they may give respect to him.
<br>20:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;不 料 ， 园 户 看 见 他 ， 就 彼 此 商 量 说 ， 这 是 承 受 产 业 的 。 我 们 杀 他 吧 ， 使 产 业 归 于 我 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But when the workmen saw him, they said to one another, This is he who will one day be the owner of the property: let us put him to death and the heritage will be ours.
<br>20:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 把 他 推 出 葡 萄 园 外 杀 了 。 这 样 ， 葡 萄 园 的 主 人 ， 要 怎 样 处 治 他 们 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And driving him out of the garden they put him to death. Now what will the lord do to these workmen?
<br>20:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 要 来 除 灭 这 些 园 户 ， 将 葡 萄 园 转 给 别 人 。 听 见 的 人 说 ， 这 是 万 不 可 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He will come and put them to destruction and give the garden to others. And when he said this, they said, May it not be so.
<br>20:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 看 着 他 们 说 ， 经 上 记 着 ， 匠 人 所 弃 的 石 头 ， 已 作 了 房 角 的 头 块 石 头 。 这 是 什 么 意 思 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But he, looking on them, said, Is it not in the Writings, The stone which the builders put on one side, the same has become the chief stone of the building?
<br>20:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;凡 掉 在 那 石 头 上 的 ， 必 要 跌 碎 。 那 石 头 掉 在 谁 的 身 上 ， 就 要 把 谁 砸 得 稀 烂 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Everyone falling on that stone will be broken, but the man on whom the stone comes down will be crushed to dust.
<br>20:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;文 士 和 祭 司 长 ， 看 出 这 比 喻 是 指 着 他 们 说 的 ， 当 时 就 想 要 下 手 拿 他 。 只 是 惧 怕 百 姓 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the chief priests and the scribes made attempts to get their hands on him in that very hour; and they were in fear of the people, for they saw that he had made up this story against them.
<br>20:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 窥 探 耶 稣 ， 打 发 奸 细 装 作 好 人 ， 要 在 他 的 话 上 得 把 柄 ， 好 将 他 交 在 巡 抚 的 政 权 之 下 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they kept watch on him, and sent out secret representatives, who were acting the part of good men, in order that they might get something from his words, on account of which they might give him up to the government and into the power of the ruler.
<br>20:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;奸 细 就 问 耶 稣 说 ， 夫 子 ， 我 们 晓 得 你 所 讲 所 传 都 是 正 道 ， 也 不 取 人 的 外 貌 ， 乃 是 诚 诚 实 实 传 神 的 道 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they put a question to him, saying, Master, we are certain that your teaching and your words are right, and that you have no respect for a man's position, but you are teaching the true way of God:
<br>20:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 们 纳 税 给 该 撒 ， 可 以 不 可 以 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Is it right for us to make payment of taxes to Caesar or not?
<br>20:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 看 出 他 们 的 诡 诈 ， 就 对 他 们 说 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But he saw through their trick and said to them,
<br>20:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;拿 一 个 银 钱 来 给 我 看 。 这 像 和 这 号 是 谁 的 。 他 们 说 ， 是 该 撒 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Let me see a penny. Whose image and name are on it? And they said, Caesar's.
<br>20:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 这 样 ， 该 撒 的 物 当 归 给 该 撒 ， 神 的 物 当 归 给 神 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said, Then give to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's.
<br>20:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 当 着 百 姓 ， 在 这 话 上 得 不 着 把 柄 。 又 希 奇 他 的 应 对 ， 就 闭 口 无 言 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they were not able to get anything from these words before the people: but they were full of wonder at his answer, and said nothing.
<br>20:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;撒 都 该 人 常 说 没 有 复 活 的 事 。 有 几 个 来 问 耶 稣 说 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And some of the Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no coming back from the dead; and they said to him,
<br>20:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;夫 子 ， 摩 西 为 我 们 写 着 说 ， 人 若 有 妻 无 子 就 死 了 ， 他 兄 弟 当 娶 他 的 妻 ， 为 哥 哥 生 子 立 后 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Master, Moses said that if a man's brother comes to his end, having a wife, but no children, his brother is to take the wife, and get a family for his brother.
<br>20:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 弟 兄 七 人 。 第 一 个 娶 了 妻 ， 没 有 孩 子 死 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now there were seven brothers, and the first had a wife and came to his end, having no children;
<br>20:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;第 二 个 ， 第 三 个 ， 也 娶 过 她 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the second;
<br>20:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 七 个 人 ， 都 娶 过 她 ， 没 有 留 下 孩 子 就 死 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the third took her; and in the same way, all the seven, without having any children, came to their end.
<br>20:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;后 来 妇 人 也 死 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Last of all the woman died also.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And last of all, the woman came to her end.
<br>20:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 样 当 复 活 的 时 候 ， 她 是 哪 一 个 的 妻 子 呢 ？ 因 为 他 们 七 个 人 都 娶 过 她 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;When they come back from the dead, whose wife will she be? for all the seven had her.
<br>20:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 这 世 界 的 人 ， 有 娶 有 嫁 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus said to them, The sons of this world are married and have wives;
<br>20:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;惟 有 算 为 配 得 那 世 界 ， 与 从 死 里 复 活 的 人 ， 也 不 娶 也 不 嫁 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But those to whom is given the reward of the world to come, and to come back from the dead, have no wives, and are not married;
<br>20:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 他 们 不 能 再 死 。 和 天 使 一 样 。 既 是 复 活 的 人 ， 就 为 神 的 儿 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And death has no more power over them, for they are equal to the angels, and are sons of God, being of those who will come back from the dead.
<br>20:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;至 于 死 人 复 活 ， 摩 西 在 荆 棘 篇 上 ， 称 主 是 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 神 ， 以 撒 的 神 ， 雅 各 的 神 ， 就 指 示 明 白 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But even Moses made it clear that the dead come back to life, saying, in the story of the burning thorn-tree, The Lord, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
<br>20:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;神 原 不 是 死 人 的 神 ， 乃 是 活 人 的 神 。 因 为 在 他 那 里 ， 人 都 是 活 的 。 （ 那 里 或 作 看 来 ）
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now he is not the God of the dead but of the living: for all men are living to him.
<br>20:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 几 个 文 士 说 ， 夫 子 ， 你 说 得 好 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And some of the scribes, in answer to this, said, Master, you have said well.
<br>20:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;以 后 他 们 不 敢 再 问 他 什 么 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they had fear of putting any more questions to him.
<br>20:41&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 人 怎 么 说 基 督 是 大 卫 的 子 孙 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, Why do they say that the Christ is the son of David?
<br>20:42&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;诗 篇 上 ， 大 卫 自 己 说 ， 主 对 我 主 说 ， 你 坐 在 我 的 右 边 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For David himself says in the book of Psalms, The Lord said to my Lord, Take your seat at my right hand,
<br>20:43&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;等 我 使 你 仇 敌 作 你 的 脚 凳 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Till I put under your feet all those who are against you.
<br>20:44&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;大 卫 既 称 他 为 主 ， 他 怎 么 又 是 大 卫 的 子 孙 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;David then gives him the name of Lord, so how is it possible for him to be his son?
<br>20:45&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 百 姓 听 的 时 候 ， 耶 稣 对 门 徒 说 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples,
<br>20:46&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 要 防 备 文 士 。 他 们 好 穿 长 衣 游 行 ， 喜 爱 人 在 街 市 上 问 他 们 安 ， 又 喜 爱 会 堂 里 的 高 位 ， 筵 席 上 的 首 座 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Keep away from the scribes, whose pleasure it is to go about in long robes, and to have words of respect said to them in the market-places, and to take the chief seats in the Synagogues and the first places at feasts;
<br>20:47&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 侵 吞 寡 妇 的 家 产 ， 假 意 作 很 长 的 祷 告 。 这 些 人 要 受 更 重 的 刑 罚 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Who take the property of widows and before the eyes of men make long prayers; they will get a greater punishment.
