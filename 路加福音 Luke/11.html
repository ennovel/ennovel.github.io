<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And it came about that he was in prayer in a certain place, and when he came to an end, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, will you give us teaching about prayer, as John did to his disciples?
<br>11:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 你 们 祷 告 的 时 候 ， 要 说 ， 我 们 在 天 上 的 父 ， 有 古 卷 只 作 父 阿 愿 人 都 尊 你 的 名 为 圣 。 愿 你 的 国 降 临 。 愿 你 的 旨 意 行 在 地 上 ， 如 同 行 在 天 上 。 有 古 卷 无 愿 你 的 旨 意 云 云
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, When you say your prayers, say, Father, may your name be kept holy and your kingdom come.
<br>11:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 们 日 用 的 饮 食 ， 天 天 赐 给 我 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Give us day by day our daily bread.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Give us every day bread for our needs.
<br>11:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;赦 免 我 们 的 罪 ， 因 为 我 们 也 赦 免 凡 亏 欠 我 们 的 人 。 不 叫 我 们 遇 见 试 探 。 救 我 们 脱 离 凶 恶 。 有 古 卷 无 末 句
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;May we have forgiveness for our sins, as we make free all those who are in debt to us. And let us not be put to the test.
<br>11:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 又 说 ， 你 们 中 间 谁 有 一 个 朋 友 ， 半 夜 到 他 那 里 去 说 ， 朋 友 ， 请 借 给 我 三 个 饼 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, Which of you, having a friend, would go to him in the middle of the night and say to him, Friend, let me have three cakes of bread;
<br>11:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 我 有 一 个 朋 友 行 路 ， 来 到 我 这 里 ， 我 没 有 什 么 给 他 摆 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Because a friend of mine has come to me on a journey, and I have nothing to put before him;
<br>11:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 人 在 里 面 回 答 说 ， 不 要 搅 扰 我 。 门 已 经 关 闭 ， 孩 子 们 也 同 我 在 床 上 了 。 我 不 能 起 来 给 你 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he, from inside the house, would say in answer, Do not be a trouble to me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; it is not possible for me to get up and give to you?
<br>11:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 告 诉 你 们 ， 虽 不 因 他 是 朋 友 起 来 给 他 ， 但 因 他 情 词 迫 切 地 直 求 ， 就 必 起 来 照 他 所 需 用 的 给 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;I say to you, Though he will not get up and give to him, because he is his friend, still, if he keeps on making his request, he will get up and give him as much as he has need of.
<br>11:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 又 告 诉 你 们 ， 你 们 祈 求 就 给 你 们 。 寻 找 就 寻 见 。 叩 门 就 给 你 们 开 门 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And I say to you, Make requests, and they will be answered; what you are searching for, you will get; when you give the sign, the door will be open to you.
<br>11:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 凡 祈 求 的 就 得 着 。 寻 找 的 就 寻 见 。 叩 门 的 就 给 他 开 门 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For to everyone who makes a request, it will be given; and he who is searching will get his desire; and to him who gives the sign, the door will be open.
<br>11:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 中 间 作 父 亲 的 ， 谁 有 儿 子 求 饼 ， 反 给 他 石 头 呢 ？ 求 鱼 ， 反 拿 蛇 当 鱼 给 他 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And which of you, being a father, will give a stone to his son, who makes request for bread? or for a fish, will give him a snake?
<br>11:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;求 鸡 蛋 ， 反 给 他 蝎 子 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Or for an egg, will give him a scorpion?
<br>11:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 虽 然 不 好 ， 尚 且 知 道 拿 好 东 西 给 儿 女 。 何 况 天 父 ， 岂 不 更 将 圣 灵 给 求 他 的 人 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;If, then, you who are evil are able to give good things to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who make request to him?
<br>11:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 赶 出 一 个 叫 人 哑 吧 的 鬼 。 鬼 出 去 了 ， 哑 吧 就 说 出 话 来 众 人 都 希 奇 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he was sending an evil spirit out of a man who was without the power of talking. And it came about that when the spirit had gone the man had the power of talking; and the people were full of wonder.
<br>11:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;内 中 却 有 人 说 ， 他 是 靠 着 鬼 王 别 西 卜 赶 鬼 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But some of them said, He sends out evil spirits by Beelzebul, the ruler of evil spirits.
<br>11:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 有 人 试 探 耶 稣 ， 向 他 求 从 天 上 来 的 神 迹 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And others, testing him, were looking for a sign from heaven from him.
<br>11:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 晓 得 他 们 的 意 念 ， 便 对 他 们 说 ， 凡 一 国 自 相 分 争 ， 就 成 为 荒 场 。 凡 一 家 自 相 分 争 ， 就 必 败 落 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But he, having knowledge of their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom in which there is division is made waste; and a house in which there is division comes to destruction.
<br>11:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;若 撒 但 自 相 分 争 ， 他 的 国 怎 能 站 得 住 呢 ？ 因 为 你 们 说 我 是 靠 着 别 西 卜 赶 鬼 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;If, then, Satan is at war with himself, how will he keep his kingdom? because you say that I send evil spirits out of men by the help of Beelzebul.
<br>11:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 若 靠 着 别 西 卜 赶 鬼 ， 你 们 的 子 弟 赶 鬼 ， 又 靠 着 谁 呢 ？ 这 样 ， 他 们 就 要 断 定 你 们 的 是 非 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And if I, by Beelzebul, send out evil spirits, by whose help do your sons send them out? so let them be your judges.
<br>11:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 若 靠 着 神 的 能 力 赶 鬼 ， 这 就 是 神 的 国 临 到 你 们 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But if I, by the finger of God, send out evil spirits, then the kingdom of God has overtaken you.
<br>11:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;壮 士 披 挂 整 齐 ， 看 守 自 己 的 住 宅 ， 他 所 有 的 都 平 安 无 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;When the strong man armed keeps watch over his house, then his goods are safe:
<br>11:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 有 一 个 比 他 更 壮 的 来 ， 胜 过 他 ， 就 夺 去 他 所 倚 靠 的 盔 甲 兵 器 ， 又 分 了 他 的 赃 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But when one who is stronger makes an attack on him and overcomes him, he takes away his instruments of war, in which he had put his faith, and makes division of his goods.
<br>11:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;不 与 我 相 合 的 ， 就 是 敌 我 的 。 不 同 我 收 聚 的 ， 就 是 分 散 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He who is not with me is against me, and he who will not give me help in getting people together is driving them away.
<br>11:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;污 鬼 离 了 人 身 ， 就 在 无 水 之 地 ， 过 来 过 去 ， 寻 求 安 歇 之 处 。 既 寻 不 着 ， 便 说 ， 我 要 回 到 我 所 出 来 的 屋 里 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The unclean spirit, when he has gone out of a man, goes through dry places, looking for rest; and when he does not get it, he says, I will go back to my house from which I came.
<br>11:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;到 了 ， 就 看 见 里 面 打 扫 干 净 ， 修 饰 好 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he comes, he sees that it has been made fair and clean.
<br>11:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;便 去 另 带 了 七 个 比 自 己 更 恶 的 鬼 来 ， 都 进 去 住 在 那 里 。 那 人 末 后 的 景 况 ， 比 先 前 更 不 好 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then he goes and gets seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they go in, and take their places there: and the last condition of that man is worse than the first.
<br>11:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 正 说 这 话 的 时 候 ， 众 人 中 间 ， 有 一 个 女 人 大 声 说 ， 怀 你 胎 的 和 乳 养 你 的 有 福 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And it came about that when he said these things, a certain woman among the people said in a loud voice, Happy is the body which gave you birth, and the breasts from which you took milk.
<br>11:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 是 却 还 不 如 听 神 之 道 而 遵 守 的 人 有 福 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But he said, More happy are they who give hearing to the word of God and keep it.
<br>11:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;当 众 人 聚 集 的 时 候 ， 耶 稣 开 讲 说 ， 这 世 代 是 一 个 邪 恶 的 世 代 。 他 们 求 看 神 迹 ， 除 了 约 拿 的 神 迹 以 外 ， 再 没 有 神 迹 给 他 们 看 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when a great number of people came together to him, he said, This generation is an evil generation: it is looking for a sign and no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah.
<br>11:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;约 拿 怎 样 为 尼 尼 微 人 成 了 神 迹 ， 人 子 也 要 照 样 为 这 世 代 的 人 成 了 神 迹 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will the Son of man be to this generation.
<br>11:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;当 审 判 的 时 候 ， 南 方 的 女 王 ， 要 起 来 定 这 世 代 的 罪 。 因 为 她 从 地 极 而 来 ， 要 听 所 罗 门 的 智 慧 话 。 看 哪 ， 在 这 里 有 一 人 比 所 罗 门 更 大 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The queen of the South will come up on the day of judging and give her decision against the men of this generation: for she came from the ends of the earth to give ear to the wisdom of Solomon; and now something greater than Solomon is here.
<br>11:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;当 审 判 的 时 候 ， 尼 尼 微 人 ， 要 起 来 定 这 世 代 的 罪 。 因 为 尼 尼 微 人 听 了 约 拿 所 传 的 ， 就 悔 改 了 。 看 哪 ， 在 这 里 有 一 人 比 约 拿 更 大 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The men of Nineveh will come up in the day of judging and give their decision against this generation: for they were turned away from their sins at the preaching of Jonah; but now something greater than Jonah is here.
<br>11:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;没 有 人 点 灯 放 在 地 窨 子 里 ， 或 是 斗 底 下 ， 总 是 放 在 灯 台 上 ， 使 进 来 的 人 得 见 亮 光 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;No man, when the light has been lighted, puts it in a secret place, or under a vessel, but on its table, so that those who come in may see the light.
<br>11:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 眼 睛 就 是 身 上 的 灯 ， 你 的 眼 睛 若 了 亮 ， 全 身 就 光 明 。 眼 睛 若 昏 花 ， 全 身 就 黑 暗 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The light of the body is the eye: when your eye is true, all your body is full of light; but when it is evil, your body is dark.
<br>11:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;所 以 你 要 省 察 ， 恐 怕 你 里 头 的 光 ， 或 者 黑 暗 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So take care that the light which is in you is not dark.
<br>11:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;若 是 你 全 身 光 明 ， 毫 无 黑 暗 ， 就 必 全 然 光 明 ， 如 同 灯 的 明 光 照 亮 你 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;If, then, all your body is light, with no part of it dark, it will be completely full of light, as when a flame with its bright shining gives you light.
<br>11:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;说 话 的 时 候 ， 有 一 个 法 利 赛 人 请 耶 稣 同 他 吃 饭 。 耶 稣 就 进 去 坐 席 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now, while he was talking, a Pharisee made a request that he would come to a meal with him; and he went in and took his seat at the meal.
<br>11:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 法 利 赛 人 看 见 耶 稣 饭 前 不 洗 手 ， 便 诧 异 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the Pharisee saw it, he was surprised because he came to the meal without first washing himself.
<br>11:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;主 对 他 说 ， 如 今 你 们 法 利 赛 人 洗 净 杯 盘 的 外 面 。 你 们 里 面 却 满 了 勒 索 和 邪 恶 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the Lord said to him, You Pharisees make the outside of the cup and the plate clean; but inside you are thieves and full of evil.
<br>11:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;无 知 的 人 哪 ， 造 外 面 的 ， 不 也 造 里 面 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;O you foolish ones! did not he who made the outside in the same way make the inside?
<br>11:41&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;只 要 把 里 面 的 施 舍 给 人 ， 凡 物 于 你 们 就 都 洁 净 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But if you give to the poor such things as you are able, then all things are clean to you.
<br>11:42&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 法 利 赛 人 有 祸 了 。 因 为 你 们 将 薄 荷 芸 香 ， 并 各 样 菜 蔬 ， 献 上 十 分 之 一 ， 那 公 义 和 爱 神 的 事 ， 反 倒 不 行 了 。 这 原 是 你 们 当 行 的 ， 那 也 是 不 可 不 行 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But a curse is on you, Pharisees! for you make men give a tenth of every sort of plant, and give no thought to right and the love of God; but it is right for you to do these things, and not let the others be undone.
<br>11:43&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 法 利 赛 人 有 祸 了 。 因 为 你 们 喜 爱 会 堂 里 的 首 位 ， 又 喜 爱 人 在 街 市 上 问 你 们 的 安 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;A curse is on you, Pharisees! for your desires are for the most important seats in the Synagogues and for words of respect said to you in the market-place.
<br>11:44&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 有 祸 了 。 因 为 你 们 如 同 不 显 露 的 坟 墓 ， 走 在 上 面 的 人 并 不 知 道 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;A curse is on you! for you are like the resting-places of dead men, which are not seen, and men go walking over them without knowledge of it.
<br>11:45&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;律 法 师 中 有 一 个 回 答 耶 稣 说 ， 夫 子 ， 你 这 样 说 ， 也 把 我 们 糟 蹋 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And one of the teachers of the law, answering, said to him, Master, in saying this, you give a bad name to us as to them.
<br>11:46&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 你 们 律 法 师 也 有 祸 了 。 因 为 你 们 把 难 担 的 担 子 ， 放 在 人 身 上 ， 自 己 一 个 指 头 却 不 肯 动 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said, A curse is on you, teachers of the law! for while other men are crushed under the weight of the rules you make for them, you yourselves do not put so much as one finger to them.
<br>11:47&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 有 祸 了 。 因 为 你 们 修 造 先 知 的 坟 墓 ， 那 先 知 正 是 你 们 的 祖 宗 所 杀 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;A curse is on you! for you make resting-places for the bodies of the prophets, but your fathers put them to death.
<br>11:48&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;可 见 你 们 祖 宗 所 作 的 事 ， 你 们 又 证 明 又 喜 欢 。 因 为 他 们 杀 了 先 知 ， 你 们 修 造 先 知 的 坟 墓 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So you are witnesses and give approval to the work of your fathers; for they put them to death and you make their last resting-places.
<br>11:49&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;所 以 神 用 智 慧 曾 说 ， 用 智 慧 或 作 的 智 者 我 要 差 遣 先 知 和 使 徒 ， 到 他 们 那 里 去 。 有 的 他 们 要 杀 害 ， 有 的 他 们 要 逼 迫 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For this reason the wisdom of God has said, I will send them prophets and teachers, and to some of them they will give death and cruel pains;
<br>11:50&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;使 创 世 以 来 ， 所 流 众 先 知 血 的 罪 ， 都 要 问 在 这 世 代 的 人 身 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So that punishment may come on this generation for the blood of all the prophets which was given from the earliest days;
<br>11:51&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 是 从 亚 伯 的 血 起 ， 直 到 被 杀 在 坛 和 殿 中 间 撒 迦 利 亚 的 血 为 止 。 我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 这 都 要 问 在 这 世 代 的 人 身 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who was put to death between the altar and the Temple. Yes, I say to you, It will come on this generation.
<br>11:52&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 律 法 师 有 祸 了 。 因 为 你 们 把 知 识 的 钥 匙 夺 了 去 。 自 己 不 进 去 ， 正 要 进 去 的 人 ， 你 们 也 阻 挡 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;A curse is on you, teachers of the law! for you have taken away the key of knowledge: you did not go in yourselves, and you got in the way of those who were going in.
<br>11:53&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 从 那 里 出 来 ， 文 士 和 法 利 赛 人 ， 就 极 力 地 催 逼 他 ， 引 动 他 多 说 话 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he had come out of that place, the scribes and the Pharisees came round him angrily, questioning him about more things;
<br>11:54&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;私 下 窥 听 ， 要 拿 他 的 话 柄 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And watching him, for a chance to get something from his words which might be used against him.
