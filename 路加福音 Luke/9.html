<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And getting the twelve together, he gave them power and authority over all evil spirits and over diseases, to make them well.
<br>9:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 差 遣 他 们 去 宣 传 神 国 的 道 ， 医 治 病 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he sent them out to be preachers of the kingdom of God, and to make well those who were ill.
<br>9:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;对 他 们 说 ， 行 路 的 时 候 ， 不 要 带 拐 杖 ， 和 口 袋 ， 不 要 带 食 物 ， 和 银 子 ， 也 不 要 带 两 件 褂 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, Take nothing for your journey, no stick or bag or bread or money, and do not take two coats.
<br>9:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;无 论 进 哪 一 家 ， 就 住 在 那 里 ， 也 从 那 里 起 行 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And if you go into a house, let that house be your resting-place till you go away.
<br>9:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;凡 不 接 待 你 们 的 ， 你 们 离 开 那 城 的 时 候 ， 要 把 脚 上 的 尘 土 跺 下 去 ， 见 证 他 们 的 不 是 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And if any people will not take you in, when you go away from that town, put off its dust from your feet for a witness against them.
<br>9:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;门 徒 就 出 去 ， 走 遍 各 乡 ， 宣 传 福 音 ， 到 处 治 病 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they went away, journeying through all the towns, preaching the good news and making people free from diseases in all places.
<br>9:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;分 封 的 王 希 律 听 见 耶 稣 所 作 的 一 切 事 ， 就 游 移 不 定 。 因 为 有 人 说 ， 是 约 翰 从 死 里 复 活 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now Herod the king had news of all these things: and he was in doubt, because it was said by some people that John had come back from the dead;
<br>9:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 有 人 说 ， 是 以 利 亚 显 现 。 还 有 人 说 ， 是 古 时 的 一 个 先 知 又 活 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And by some, that Elijah had come; and by others, that one of the old prophets had come back to life.
<br>9:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;希 律 说 ， 约 翰 我 已 经 斩 了 ， 这 却 是 什 么 人 ？ 我 竟 听 见 他 这 样 的 事 呢 ？ 就 想 要 见 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Herod said, I put John to death: but who is this, of whom such stories are given to me? And he had a desire to see him.
<br>9:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;使 徒 回 来 ， 将 所 作 的 事 告 诉 耶 稣 。 耶 稣 就 带 他 们 暗 暗 地 离 开 那 里 ， 往 一 座 城 去 ， 那 城 名 叫 伯 赛 大 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the twelve, when they came back, gave him an account of what they had done. And he took them with him and went away from the people to a town named Beth-saida.
<br>9:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 众 人 知 道 了 ， 就 跟 着 他 去 。 耶 稣 便 接 待 他 们 ， 对 他 们 讲 论 神 国 的 道 ， 医 治 那 些 需 医 的 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But the people, getting news of it, went after him: and he was pleased to see them, and gave them teaching about the kingdom of God, and made those well who were in need of it.
<br>9:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;日 头 快 要 平 西 ， 十 二 个 门 徒 来 对 他 说 ， 请 叫 众 人 散 开 ， 他 们 好 往 四 面 乡 村 里 去 借 宿 找 吃 的 。 因 为 我 们 这 里 是 野 地 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the day went on; and the twelve came to him and said, Send these people away so that they may go into the towns and the country round about and get resting-places and food for themselves, for we are in a waste place.
<br>9:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 你 们 给 他 们 吃 吧 。 门 徒 说 ， 我 们 不 过 有 五 个 饼 ， 两 条 鱼 。 若 不 去 为 这 许 多 人 买 食 物 就 不 够 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But he said, Give them food yourselves. And they said, We have only five cakes of bread and two fishes, if we do not go and get food for all these people.
<br>9:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 时 ， 人 数 约 有 五 千 。 耶 稣 对 门 徒 说 ， 叫 他 们 一 排 一 排 的 坐 下 ， 每 排 大 约 五 十 个 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them be seated in groups, about fifty to a group.
<br>9:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;门 徒 就 如 此 行 ， 叫 众 人 都 坐 下 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they did so, and made them all sit down.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they did so, and made them all be seated.
<br>9:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 拿 着 这 五 个 饼 ， 两 条 鱼 ， 望 着 天 祝 福 ， 掰 开 ， 递 给 门 徒 摆 在 众 人 面 前 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he took the five cakes of bread and the two fishes and, looking up to heaven, he said words of blessing over them, and when they had been broken, he gave them to the disciples to give to the people.
<br>9:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 就 吃 ， 并 且 都 吃 饱 了 。 把 剩 下 的 零 碎 收 拾 起 来 ， 装 满 了 十 二 篮 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they all took the food and had enough; and they took up of the broken bits which were over, twelve baskets full.
<br>9:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 自 己 祷 告 的 时 候 ， 门 徒 也 同 他 在 那 里 。 耶 稣 问 他 们 说 ， 众 人 说 我 是 谁 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And it came about that when he was in prayer, by himself, and the disciples were with him, he put a question to them, saying, Who do the people say I am?
<br>9:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 说 ， 有 人 说 是 施 洗 的 约 翰 。 有 人 说 是 以 利 亚 。 还 有 人 说 ， 是 古 时 的 一 个 先 知 又 活 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they, answering, said, John the Baptist; but others say Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets has come back.
<br>9:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 你 们 说 我 是 谁 。 彼 得 回 答 说 ， 是 神 所 立 的 基 督 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said, But who do you say that I am? And Peter, answering, said, The Christ of God.
<br>9:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 切 切 地 嘱 咐 他 们 ， 不 可 将 这 事 告 诉 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But he gave them special orders, not to say this to any man;
<br>9:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 说 ， 人 子 必 须 受 许 多 的 苦 ， 被 长 老 祭 司 长 和 文 士 弃 绝 ， 并 且 被 杀 ， 第 三 日 复 活 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Saying, The Son of man will undergo much and be put on one side by the rulers and the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and be put to death, and on the third day he will come back to life.
<br>9:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 又 对 众 人 说 ， 若 有 人 要 跟 从 我 ， 就 当 舍 己 ， 天 天 背 起 他 的 十 字 架 来 ， 跟 从 我 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them all, If any man has a desire to come after me, let him give up all, and take up his cross every day, and come after me.
<br>9:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 凡 要 救 自 己 生 命 的 ， 生 命 或 作 灵 魂 下 同 必 丧 掉 生 命 。 凡 为 我 丧 掉 生 命 的 ， 必 救 了 生 命 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For whoever has a desire to keep his life will have it taken from him, but whoever gives up his life because of me, will keep it.
<br>9:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;人 若 赚 得 全 世 界 ， 却 丧 了 自 己 ， 赔 上 自 己 ， 有 什 么 益 处 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For what profit will a man have if he gets all the world, but undergoes loss or destruction himself?
<br>9:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;凡 把 我 和 我 的 道 当 作 可 耻 的 ， 人 子 在 自 己 的 荣 耀 里 ， 并 天 父 与 圣 天 使 的 荣 耀 里 ， 降 临 的 时 候 ， 也 要 把 那 人 当 作 可 耻 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For if any man has a feeling of shame because of me or of my words, the Son of man will have shame because of him when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
<br>9:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 站 在 这 里 的 ， 有 人 在 没 尝 死 味 以 前 ， 必 看 见 神 的 国 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But truly I say to you, Some of those who are here now will have no taste of death till they see the kingdom of God.
<br>9:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;说 了 这 话 以 后 ， 约 有 八 天 ， 耶 稣 带 着 彼 得 ， 约 翰 ， 雅 各 ， 上 山 去 祷 告 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And about eight days after he had said these things, he took Peter and John and James with him and went up into the mountain for prayer.
<br>9:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;正 祷 告 的 时 候 ， 他 的 面 貌 就 改 变 了 ， 衣 服 洁 白 放 光 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And while he was in prayer, his face was changed and his clothing became white and shining.
<br>9:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;忽 然 有 摩 西 以 利 亚 两 个 人 ， 同 耶 稣 说 话 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And two men, Moses and Elijah, were talking with him;
<br>9:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 在 荣 光 里 显 现 ， 谈 论 耶 稣 去 世 的 事 ， 就 是 他 在 耶 路 撒 冷 将 要 成 的 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Who were seen in glory and were talking of his death which was about to take place in Jerusalem.
<br>9:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 和 他 的 同 伴 都 打 盹 ， 既 清 醒 了 ， 就 看 见 耶 稣 的 荣 光 ， 并 同 他 站 着 的 那 两 个 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now Peter and those who were with him were overcome with sleep: but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men who were with him.
<br>9:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;二 人 正 要 和 耶 稣 分 离 的 时 候 ， 彼 得 对 耶 稣 说 ， 夫 子 ， 我 们 在 这 里 真 好 ， 可 以 搭 三 座 棚 ， 一 座 为 你 ， 一 座 为 摩 西 ， 一 座 为 以 利 亚 。 他 却 不 知 道 所 说 的 是 什 么 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when they were about to go away from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah: having no knowledge of what he was saying.
<br>9:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;说 这 话 的 时 候 ， 有 一 朵 云 彩 来 遮 盖 他 们 。 他 们 进 入 云 彩 里 就 惧 怕 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And while he said these things, the shade of a cloud came over them, and they were full of fear when they went into the cloud.
<br>9:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 声 音 从 云 彩 里 出 来 ， 说 ， 这 是 我 的 儿 子 ， 我 所 拣 选 的 （ 有 古 卷 作 这 是 我 的 爱 子 ） ， 你 们 要 听 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And there was a voice from the cloud saying, This is my Son, the man of my selection; give ear to him.
<br>9:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;声 音 住 了 ， 只 见 耶 稣 一 人 在 那 里 。 当 那 些 日 子 ， 门 徒 不 提 所 看 见 的 事 ， 一 样 也 不 告 诉 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And after the voice was gone they saw that Jesus was by himself. And they kept quiet, and said nothing at that time to anyone of the things which they had seen.
<br>9:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;第 二 天 ， 他 们 下 了 山 ， 就 有 许 多 人 迎 见 耶 稣 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And on the day after, when they came down from the mountain, a great band of people came to him.
<br>9:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;其 中 有 一 人 喊 叫 说 ， 夫 子 ， 求 你 看 顾 我 的 儿 子 ， 因 为 他 是 我 的 独 生 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And a man from among them, crying out, said, Master, I make a request to you, give a thought to my son, for he is my only child:
<br>9:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 被 鬼 抓 住 ， 就 忽 然 喊 叫 。 鬼 又 叫 他 抽 疯 ， 口 中 流 沫 ， 并 且 重 重 地 伤 害 他 ， 难 以 离 开 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And see, a spirit takes him, and suddenly he gives a cry, twisted in pain and streaming at the lips, and when it goes away from him at last, he is marked as from blows.
<br>9:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 求 过 你 的 门 徒 ， 把 鬼 赶 出 去 ， 他 们 却 是 不 能 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And I made a request to your disciples to send it out of him, but they were not able to do it.
<br>9:41&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 嗳 ， 这 又 不 信 又 悖 谬 的 世 代 阿 ， 我 在 你 们 这 里 ， 忍 耐 你 们 ， 要 到 几 时 呢 ？ 将 你 的 儿 子 带 到 这 里 来 吧 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus said, O generation without faith and false in heart, how long will I have to be with you and put up with you? let your son come here.
<br>9:42&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;正 来 的 时 候 ， 鬼 把 他 摔 倒 ， 叫 他 重 重 地 抽 疯 。 耶 稣 就 斥 责 那 污 鬼 ， 把 孩 子 治 好 了 ， 交 给 他 父 亲 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And while he was coming, he was pushed violently down and twisted by the evil spirit. But Jesus gave sharp orders to the unclean spirit, and made the boy well, and gave him back to his father.
<br>9:43&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 都 诧 异 神 的 大 能 。 大 能 或 作 威 荣 耶 稣 所 作 的 一 切 事 ， 众 人 正 希 奇 的 时 候 ， 耶 稣 对 门 徒 说 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they were full of wonder at the great power of God. But while they were all wondering at all the things which he did, he said to his disciples,
<br>9:44&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 要 把 这 些 话 存 在 耳 中 。 因 为 人 子 将 要 被 交 在 人 手 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Let these words go deep into your ears, for the Son of man will be given up into the hands of men.
<br>9:45&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 不 明 白 这 话 ， 意 思 乃 是 隐 藏 的 ， 叫 他 们 不 能 明 白 ， 他 们 也 不 敢 问 这 话 的 意 思 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But this saying was not clear to them and its sense was kept secret from them so that they were not able to see it: and they had fear of questioning him about it.
<br>9:46&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;门 徒 中 间 起 了 议 论 ， 谁 将 为 大 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now there was a discussion among them about which of them would be the greatest.
<br>9:47&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 看 出 他 们 心 中 的 议 论 ， 就 领 一 个 小 孩 子 来 ， 叫 他 站 在 自 己 旁 边 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But when Jesus saw the reasoning of their hearts, he took a small child and put him by his side,
<br>9:48&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;对 他 们 说 ， 凡 为 我 名 接 待 这 小 孩 子 的 ， 就 是 接 待 我 。 凡 接 待 我 的 ， 就 是 接 待 那 差 我 来 的 。 你 们 中 间 最 小 的 ， 他 便 为 大 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And said to them, Whoever gives honour to this child in my name, gives honour to me: and whoever gives honour to me, gives honour to him who sent me: for whoever is least among you all, that man is great.
<br>9:49&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;约 翰 说 ， 夫 子 ， 我 们 看 见 一 个 人 奉 你 的 名 赶 鬼 ， 我 们 就 禁 止 他 。 因 为 他 不 与 我 们 一 同 跟 从 你 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And John, answering, said, Master, we saw a man driving out evil spirits in your name, and we did not let him do it, because he was not one of us.
<br>9:50&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 不 要 禁 止 他 。 因 为 不 敌 挡 你 们 的 ， 就 是 帮 助 你 们 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Jesus said to him, Let him do it, for he who is not against you is for you.
<br>9:51&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 被 接 上 升 的 日 子 将 到 ， 他 就 定 意 向 耶 路 撒 冷 去 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And it came about that when the days were near for him to be taken up, his face was turned to go to Jerusalem,
<br>9:52&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;便 打 发 使 者 在 他 前 头 走 。 他 们 到 了 撒 玛 利 亚 的 一 个 村 庄 ， 要 为 他 预 备 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he sent men before: and they came to a small town of Samaria to make ready for him.
<br>9:53&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 里 的 人 不 接 待 他 ， 因 他 面 向 耶 路 撒 冷 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But they would not have him there, because he was clearly going to Jerusalem.
<br>9:54&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 的 门 徒 ， 雅 各 ， 约 翰 ， 看 见 了 ， 就 说 ， 主 阿 ， 你 要 我 们 吩 咐 火 从 天 上 降 下 来 ， 烧 灭 他 们 ， 像 以 利 亚 所 作 的 吗 （ 有 古 卷 无 像 以 利 亚 所 作 的 数 字 ） ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, Lord, may we send fire from heaven and put an end to them?
<br>9:55&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 转 身 责 备 两 个 门 徒 说 ， 你 们 的 心 如 何 ， 你 们 并 不 知 道 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But turning round he said sharp words to them.
<br>9:56&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;人 子 来 不 是 要 灭 人 的 性 命 （ 性 命 或 作 灵 魂 。 下 同 。 ） ， 是 要 救 人 的 性 命 。 说 着 就 往 别 的 村 庄 去 了 （ 有 古 卷 只 有 五 十 五 节 首 句 ， 五 十 六 节 末 句 。 ） 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they went to another small town.
<br>9:57&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 走 路 的 时 候 ， 有 一 人 对 耶 稣 说 你 无 论 往 哪 里 去 ， 我 要 跟 从 你 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when they were on the way, a certain man said to him, I will come after you wherever you go.
<br>9:58&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 狐 狸 有 洞 ， 天 空 的 飞 鸟 有 窝 ， 只 是 人 子 没 有 枕 头 的 地 方 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus said to him, Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have resting-places, but the Son of man has nowhere to put his head.
<br>9:59&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 对 一 个 人 说 ， 跟 从 我 来 ， 那 人 说 ， 主 ， 容 我 先 回 去 埋 葬 我 的 父 亲 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to another, Come after me. But he said, Lord, let me first go and give the last honours to my father.
<br>9:60&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 任 凭 死 人 埋 葬 他 们 的 死 人 。 你 只 管 去 传 扬 神 国 的 道 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But he said to him, Let the dead take care of their dead; it is for you to go and give news of the kingdom of God.
<br>9:61&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 有 一 人 说 ， 主 ， 我 要 跟 从 你 。 但 容 我 先 去 辞 别 我 家 里 的 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And another man said, I will come with you, Lord, but first let me say a last good-day to those who are at my house.
<br>9:62&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 手 扶 着 犁 向 后 看 的 ， 不 配 进 神 的 国 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Jesus said, No man, having put his hand to the plough and looking back, is good enough for the kingdom of God.
