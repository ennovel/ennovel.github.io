<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they all went and took him before Pilate.
<br>23:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 告 他 说 ， 我 们 见 这 人 诱 惑 国 民 ， 禁 止 纳 税 给 该 撒 ， 并 说 自 己 是 基 督 ， 是 王 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they made statements against him, saying, This man has to our knowledge been teaching our nation to do wrong, and not to make payment of taxes to Caesar, even saying that he himself is Christ, a king.
<br>23:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 问 耶 稣 说 ， 你 是 犹 太 人 的 王 吗 ？ 耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 你 说 的 是 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Pilate said to him, Are you the King of the Jews? And he said in answer, You say so.
<br>23:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 对 祭 司 长 和 众 人 说 ， 我 查 不 出 这 人 有 什 么 罪 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Pilate said to the chief priests and the people, In my opinion this man has done no wrong.
<br>23:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 他 们 越 发 极 力 地 说 ， 他 煽 惑 百 姓 ， 在 犹 太 遍 地 传 道 ， 从 加 利 利 起 ， 直 到 这 里 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But they became more violent than before, saying, He has made trouble among the people, teaching through all Judaea from Galilee to this place.
<br>23:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 一 听 见 ， 就 问 这 人 是 加 利 利 人 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But at these words Pilate said, Is the man a Galilaean?
<br>23:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;既 晓 得 耶 稣 属 希 律 所 管 ， 就 把 他 送 到 希 律 那 里 去 。 那 时 希 律 正 在 耶 路 撒 冷 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he saw that he was under the authority of Herod, he sent him to Herod, who was in Jerusalem himself at that time.
<br>23:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;希 律 看 见 耶 稣 ， 就 很 欢 喜 。 因 为 听 见 过 他 的 事 ， 久 已 想 要 见 他 。 并 且 指 望 看 他 行 一 件 神 迹 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now when Herod saw Jesus he was very glad, having for a long time had a desire to see him, for he had had accounts of him, and was hoping to see some wonders done by him.
<br>23:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 问 他 许 多 的 话 。 耶 稣 却 一 言 不 答 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he put a great number of questions to him, but he said nothing.
<br>23:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;祭 司 长 和 文 士 ， 都 站 着 极 力 地 告 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the chief priests and the scribes were there, making statements against him violently.
<br>23:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;希 律 和 他 的 兵 丁 就 藐 视 耶 稣 ， 戏 弄 他 ， 给 他 穿 上 华 丽 衣 服 ， 把 他 送 回 彼 拉 多 那 里 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Herod, with the men of his army, put shame on him and made sport of him, and dressing him in shining robes, he sent him back to Pilate.
<br>23:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;从 前 希 律 和 彼 拉 多 彼 此 有 仇 。 在 那 一 天 就 成 了 朋 友 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And that day Herod and Pilate became friends with one another, for before they had been against one another.
<br>23:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 传 齐 了 祭 司 长 ， 和 官 府 ， 并 百 姓 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Pilate sent for the chief priests and the rulers and the people, and said to them,
<br>23:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 解 这 人 到 我 这 里 ， 说 他 是 诱 惑 百 姓 的 。 看 哪 ， 我 也 曾 将 你 们 告 他 的 事 ， 在 你 们 面 前 审 问 他 ， 并 没 有 查 出 他 什 么 罪 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;You say that this man has been teaching the people evil things: now I, after going into the question before you, see nothing wrong in this man in connection with the things which you have said against him:
<br>23:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 是 希 律 也 是 如 此 ， 所 以 把 他 送 回 来 。 可 见 他 没 有 作 什 么 该 死 的 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Herod is of the same opinion, for he has sent him back to us; for, you see, he has done nothing for which I might put him to death.
<br>23:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;故 此 我 要 责 打 他 ， 把 他 释 放 了 。 （ 有 古 卷 在 此 有
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;I will therefore chastise him, and release him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And so I will give him punishment and let him go.
<br>23:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;每 逢 这 节 期 巡 抚 必 须 释 放 一 个 囚 犯 给 他 们 。 ）
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;[]
<br>23:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 却 一 齐 喊 着 说 ， 除 掉 这 个 人 ， 释 放 巴 拉 巴 给 我 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But with loud voices they said all together, Put this man to death, and make Barabbas free.
<br>23:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 巴 拉 巴 是 因 在 城 里 作 乱 杀 人 下 在 监 里 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now this man was in prison because of an attack against the government in the town, in which there had been loss of life.
<br>23:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 愿 意 释 放 耶 稣 ， 就 又 劝 解 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Pilate again said to them that it was his desire to let Jesus go free.
<br>23:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;无 奈 他 们 喊 着 说 ， 钉 他 十 字 架 ， 钉 他 十 字 架
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But crying out they said, To the cross with him!
<br>23:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 第 三 次 对 他 们 说 ， 为 什 么 呢 ？ 这 人 作 了 什 么 恶 事 呢 ？ 我 并 没 有 查 出 他 什 么 该 死 的 罪 来 。 所 以 我 要 责 打 他 ， 把 他 释 放 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them a third time, Why, what evil has he done? I see no reason for putting him to death: I will give him punishment and let him go.
<br>23:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 大 声 催 逼 彼 拉 多 ， 求 他 把 耶 稣 钉 在 十 字 架 上 。 他 们 的 声 音 就 得 了 胜 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But they went on crying out loudly, Let him be put to death on the cross. And they had their way.
<br>23:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 这 才 照 他 们 所 求 的 定 案 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Pilate gave his decision for their desire to be put into effect.
<br>23:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;把 他 们 所 求 的 那 作 乱 杀 人 下 在 监 里 的 ， 释 放 了 。 把 耶 稣 交 给 他 们 ， 任 凭 他 们 的 意 思 行 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And in answer to their request, he let that man go free who had been in prison for acting against the government and causing death, and Jesus he gave up to their pleasure.
<br>23:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;带 耶 稣 去 的 时 候 ， 有 一 个 古 利 奈 人 西 门 ， 从 乡 下 来 。 他 们 就 抓 住 他 ， 把 十 字 架 搁 在 他 身 上 ， 叫 他 背 着 跟 随 耶 稣 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And while they were taking him away, they put their hands on Simon of Cyrene, who was coming from the country, and made him take the cross after Jesus.
<br>23:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 许 多 百 姓 ， 跟 随 耶 稣 ， 内 中 有 好 些 妇 女 ， 妇 女 们 为 他 号 啕 痛 哭 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And a great band of people went after him, and of women making signs of grief and weeping for him.
<br>23:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 转 身 对 她 们 说 ， 耶 路 撒 冷 的 女 子 ， 不 要 为 我 哭 ， 当 为 自 己 和 自 己 的 儿 女 哭 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Jesus, turning to them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, let not your weeping be for me, but for yourselves and for your children.
<br>23:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 日 子 要 到 ， 人 必 说 ， 不 生 育 的 ， 和 未 曾 怀 胎 的 ， 未 曾 乳 养 婴 孩 的 ， 有 福 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For the days are coming in which they will say, Happy are those who have had no children, whose bodies have never given birth, whose breasts have never given milk.
<br>23:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 时 ， 人 要 向 大 山 说 ， 倒 在 我 们 身 上 。 向 小 山 说 ， 遮 盖 我 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they will say to the mountains, Come down on us, and to the hills, Be a cover over us.
<br>23:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 些 事 既 行 在 有 汁 水 的 树 上 ， 那 枯 干 的 树 ， 将 来 怎 么 样 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For if they do these things when the tree is green, what will they do when it is dry?
<br>23:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 有 两 个 犯 人 ， 和 耶 稣 一 同 带 来 处 死 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And two others, evil-doers, were taken with him to be put to death.
<br>23:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;到 了 一 个 地 方 ， 名 叫 髑 髅 地 ， 就 在 那 里 把 耶 稣 钉 在 十 字 架 上 ， 又 钉 了 两 个 犯 人 ， 一 个 在 左 边 ， 一 个 在 右 边 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when they came to the place which is named Golgotha, they put him on the cross, and the evil-doers, one on the right side, and the other on the left.
<br>23:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;当 下 耶 稣 说 ， 父 阿 ， 赦 免 他 们 。 因 为 他 们 所 作 的 ， 他 们 不 晓 得 。 兵 丁 就 拈 阄 分 他 的 衣 服 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus said, Father, let them have forgiveness, for they have no knowledge of what they are doing. And they made division of his clothing among them by the decision of chance.
<br>23:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;百 姓 站 在 那 里 观 看 。 官 府 也 嗤 笑 他 说 ， 他 救 了 别 人 。 他 若 是 基 督 ， 神 所 拣 选 的 ， 可 以 救 自 己 吧 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the people were looking on. And the rulers made sport of him, saying, He was a saviour of others; let him do something for himself, if he is the Christ, the man of God's selection.
<br>23:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;兵 丁 也 戏 弄 他 ， 上 前 拿 醋 送 给 他 喝 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the men of the army made sport of him, coming to him and giving him bitter wine,
<br>23:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;说 ， 你 若 是 犹 太 人 的 王 ， 可 以 救 自 己 吧 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And saying, If you are the King of the Jews, get yourself free.
<br>23:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 耶 稣 以 上 有 一 个 牌 子 ， 有 古 卷 在 此 有 用 希 利 尼 罗 马 希 伯 来 的 文 字 写 着 ， 这 是 犹 太 人 的 王 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And these words were put in writing over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
<br>23:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 同 钉 的 两 个 犯 人 ， 有 一 个 讥 诮 他 说 ， 你 不 是 基 督 吗 ？ 可 以 救 自 己 和 我 们 吧 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And one of the evil-doers on the cross, with bitter feeling, said to him, Are you not the Christ? Get yourself and us out of this.
<br>23:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 一 个 就 应 声 责 备 他 说 ， 你 既 是 一 样 受 刑 的 ， 还 不 怕 神 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But the other, protesting, said, Have you no fear of God? for you have a part in the same punishment,
<br>23:41&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 们 是 应 该 的 。 因 我 们 所 受 的 ， 与 我 们 所 作 的 相 称 。 但 这 个 人 没 有 作 过 一 件 不 好 的 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And with reason; for we have the right reward of our acts, but this man has done nothing wrong.
<br>23:42&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 说 ， 耶 稣 阿 ， 你 得 国 降 临 的 时 候 ， 求 你 记 念 我 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said, Jesus, keep me in mind when you come in your kingdom.
<br>23:43&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 说 ， 我 实 在 告 诉 你 ， 今 日 你 要 同 我 在 乐 园 里 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to him, Truly I say to you, Today you will be with me in Paradise.
<br>23:44&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 时 约 有 午 正 ， 遍 地 都 黑 暗 了 ， 直 到 申 初 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And it was now about the sixth hour; and all the land was dark till the ninth hour;
<br>23:45&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;日 头 变 黑 了 。 殿 里 的 幔 子 从 当 中 裂 为 两 半 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The light of the sun went out, and the curtain in the Temple was parted in two.
<br>23:46&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 大 声 喊 着 说 ， 父 阿 ， 我 将 我 的 灵 魂 交 在 你 手 里 。 说 了 这 话 ， 气 就 断 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus gave a loud cry and said, Father, into your hands I give my spirit: and when he had said this, he gave up his spirit.
<br>23:47&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;百 夫 长 看 见 所 成 的 事 ， 就 归 荣 耀 与 神 说 ， 这 真 是 个 义 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the captain saw what was done, he gave praise to God, saying, Without doubt this was an upright man.
<br>23:48&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;聚 集 观 看 的 众 人 ， 见 了 这 所 成 的 事 ， 都 捶 着 胸 回 去 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And all the people who had come together to see it, when they saw the things which were done, went back again making signs of grief.
<br>23:49&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;还 有 一 切 与 耶 稣 熟 识 的 人 ， 和 从 加 利 利 跟 着 他 来 的 妇 女 们 ， 都 远 远 地 站 着 ， 看 这 些 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And all his friends and the women who came with him from Galilee, were waiting at a distance, watching these things.
<br>23:50&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 一 个 人 名 叫 约 瑟 ， 是 个 议 士 ， 为 人 善 良 公 义 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now there was a man named Joseph, a man of authority and a good and upright man
<br>23:51&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 所 谋 所 为 ， 他 并 没 有 附 从 。 他 本 是 犹 太 亚 利 马 太 城 里 素 常 盼 望 神 国 的 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;(He had not given his approval to their decision or their acts), of Arimathaea, a town of the Jews, who was waiting for the kingdom of God:
<br>23:52&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 人 去 见 彼 拉 多 ， 求 耶 稣 的 身 体 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;This man went to Pilate and made a request for the body of Jesus.
<br>23:53&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 取 下 来 用 细 麻 布 裹 好 ， 安 放 在 石 头 凿 成 的 坟 墓 里 ， 那 里 头 从 来 没 有 葬 过 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he took it down, and folding it in a linen cloth, he put it in a place cut in the rock for a dead body; and no one had ever been put in it.
<br>23:54&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 日 是 预 备 日 ， 安 息 日 也 快 到 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now it was the day of making ready and the Sabbath was coming on.
<br>23:55&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 些 从 加 利 利 和 耶 稣 同 来 的 妇 女 ， 跟 在 后 面 ， 看 见 了 坟 墓 ， 和 他 的 身 体 怎 样 安 放 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the women who had come with him from Galilee went after him and saw the place and how his body had been put to rest;
<br>23:56&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;她 们 就 回 去 ， 预 备 了 香 料 香 膏 。 她 们 在 安 息 日 ， 便 遵 着 诫 命 安 息 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they went back and got ready spices and perfumes; and on the Sabbath they took their rest, in agreement with the law.
