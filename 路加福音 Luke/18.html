<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he made a story for them, the point of which was that men were to go on making prayer and not get tired;
<br>18:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;说 ， 某 城 里 有 一 个 官 ， 不 惧 怕 神 ， 也 不 尊 重 世 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Saying, There was a judge in a certain town, who had no fear of God or respect for man:
<br>18:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 城 里 有 个 寡 妇 ， 常 到 他 那 里 ， 说 ， 我 有 一 个 对 头 ， 求 你 给 我 伸 冤 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And there was a widow in that town, and she kept on coming to him and saying, Give me my right against the man who has done me wrong.
<br>18:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 多 日 不 准 。 后 来 心 里 说 ， 我 虽 不 惧 怕 神 ， 也 不 尊 重 世 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And for a time he would not: but later, he said to himself, Though I have no fear of God or respect for man,
<br>18:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;只 因 这 寡 妇 烦 扰 我 ， 我 就 给 她 伸 冤 吧 。 免 得 她 常 来 缠 磨 我 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Because this widow is a trouble to me, I will give her her right; for if not, I will be completely tired out by her frequent coming.
<br>18:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;主 说 ， 你 们 听 这 不 义 之 官 所 说 的 话 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the Lord said, Give ear to the words of the evil judge.
<br>18:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;神 的 选 民 ， 昼 夜 呼 吁 他 ， 他 纵 然 为 他 们 忍 了 多 时 ， 岂 不 终 久 给 他 们 伸 冤 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And will not God do right in the cause of his saints, whose cries come day and night to his ears, though he is long in doing it?
<br>18:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 告 诉 你 们 ， 要 快 快 地 给 他 们 伸 冤 了 ， 然 而 人 子 来 的 时 候 ， 遇 得 见 世 上 有 信 德 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;I say to you that he will quickly do right in their cause. But when the Son of man comes, will there be any faith on earth?
<br>18:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 向 那 些 仗 着 自 己 是 义 人 ， 藐 视 别 人 的 ， 设 一 个 比 喻 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he made this story for some people who were certain that they were good, and had a low opinion of others:
<br>18:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;说 ， 有 两 个 人 上 殿 里 去 祷 告 。 一 个 是 法 利 赛 人 ， 一 个 是 税 吏 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Two men went up to the Temple for prayer; one a Pharisee, and the other a tax-farmer.
<br>18:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;法 利 赛 人 站 着 ， 自 言 自 语 的 祷 告 说 ， 神 阿 ， 我 感 谢 你 ， 我 不 像 别 人 ， 勒 索 ， 不 义 ， 奸 淫 ， 也 不 像 这 个 税 吏 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The Pharisee, taking up his position, said to himself these words: God, I give you praise because I am not like other men, who take more than their right, who are evil-doers, who are untrue to their wives, or even like this tax-farmer.
<br>18:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 一 个 礼 拜 禁 食 两 次 ， 凡 我 所 得 的 ， 都 捐 上 十 分 之 一 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Twice in the week I go without food; I give a tenth of all I have.
<br>18:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 税 吏 远 远 地 站 着 ， 连 举 目 望 天 也 不 敢 ， 只 捶 着 胸 说 ， 神 阿 ， 开 恩 可 怜 我 这 个 罪 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The tax-farmer, on the other hand, keeping far away, and not lifting up even his eyes to heaven, made signs of grief and said, God, have mercy on me, a sinner.
<br>18:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 告 诉 你 们 ， 这 人 回 家 去 ， 比 那 人 倒 算 为 义 了 ， 因 为 凡 自 高 的 ， 必 降 为 卑 ， 自 卑 的 ， 必 升 为 高 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;I say to you, This man went back to his house with God's approval, and not the other: for everyone who makes himself high will be made low and whoever makes himself low will be made high.
<br>18:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 人 抱 着 自 己 的 婴 孩 ， 来 见 耶 稣 ， 要 他 摸 他 们 ， 门 徒 看 见 就 责 备 那 些 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they took their children to him, so that he might put his hands on them: but when the disciples saw it, they said sharp words to them
<br>18:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 却 叫 他 们 来 ， 说 ， 让 小 孩 子 到 我 这 里 来 ， 不 要 禁 止 他 们 ， 因 为 在 神 国 的 ， 正 是 这 样 的 人
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Jesus sent for them, saying, Let the children come to me, and do not keep them away, for of such is the kingdom of heaven.
<br>18:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 凡 要 承 受 神 国 的 ， 若 不 像 小 孩 子 ， 断 不 能 进 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Truly I say to you, Whoever does not put himself under the kingdom of God like a little child, will not come into it at all.
<br>18:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 一 个 官 问 耶 稣 说 ， 良 善 的 夫 子 ， 我 该 作 什 么 事 ， 才 可 以 承 受 永 生 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And a certain ruler put a question to him, saying, Good Master, what have I to do so that I may have eternal life?
<br>18:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 说 ， 你 为 什 么 称 我 是 良 善 的 ， 除 了 神 一 位 之 外 ， 再 没 有 良 善 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus said to him, Why do you say that I am good? No one is good, but only God.
<br>18:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;诫 命 你 是 晓 得 的 ， 不 可 奸 淫 ， 不 可 杀 人 ， 不 可 偷 盗 ， 不 可 作 假 见 证 ， 当 孝 敬 父 母 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;You have knowledge of what the law says: Do not be untrue to your wife, Do not put anyone to death, Do not take what is not yours, Do not give false witness, Give honour to your father and mother.
<br>18:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 人 说 ， 这 一 切 我 从 小 都 遵 守 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said, All these things I have done from the time when I was a boy.
<br>18:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 听 见 了 ， 就 说 ， 你 还 缺 少 一 件 ， 要 变 卖 你 一 切 所 有 的 ， 分 给 穷 人 ， 就 必 有 财 宝 在 天 上 。 你 还 要 来 跟 从 我 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus, hearing it, said to him, One thing you still have need of; get money for your goods, and give it away to the poor, and you will have wealth in heaven; and come after me.
<br>18:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 听 见 这 话 ， 就 甚 忧 愁 ， 因 为 他 很 富 足 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But at these words he became very sad, for he had great wealth.
<br>18:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 看 见 他 就 说 ， 有 钱 财 的 人 进 神 的 国 ， 是 何 等 的 难 哪 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus, looking at him, said, How hard it is for those who have wealth to get into the kingdom of God!
<br>18:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;骆 驼 穿 过 针 的 眼 ， 比 财 主 进 神 的 国 ， 还 容 易 呢 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;It is simpler for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a man who has much money to come into the kingdom of God.
<br>18:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;听 见 的 人 说 ， 这 样 ， 谁 能 得 救 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And those who were present said, Then who may have salvation?
<br>18:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 在 人 所 不 能 的 事 ， 在 神 却 能 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But he said, Things which are not possible with man are possible with God.
<br>18:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 说 ， 看 哪 ， 我 们 已 经 撇 下 自 己 所 有 的 跟 从 你 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Peter said, See, we have given up what is ours to come after you.
<br>18:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 人 为 神 的 国 ， 撇 下 房 屋 ， 或 是 妻 子 ， 弟 兄 ， 父 母 ， 儿 女 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, Truly I say to you, There is no man who has given up house or wife or brothers or father or mother or children, because of the kingdom of God,
<br>18:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;没 有 在 今 世 不 得 百 倍 ， 在 来 世 不 得 永 生 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Who will not get much more in this time, and in the world to come, eternal life.
<br>18:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 带 着 十 二 个 门 徒 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 看 哪 ， 我 们 上 耶 路 撒 冷 去 ， 先 知 所 写 的 一 切 事 ， 都 要 成 就 在 人 子 身 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he took with him the twelve and said to them, Now we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things which were said by the prophets will be done to the Son of man.
<br>18:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 将 要 被 交 给 外 邦 人 ， 他 们 要 戏 弄 他 ， 凌 辱 他 ， 吐 唾 沫 在 他 脸 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For he will be given up to the Gentiles, and will be made sport of and put to shame:
<br>18:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;并 要 鞭 打 他 ， 杀 害 他 ， 第 三 日 他 要 复 活 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he will be given cruel blows and put to death, and on the third day he will come back to life.
<br>18:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 些 事 门 徒 一 样 也 不 懂 得 ， 意 思 乃 是 隐 藏 的 ， 他 们 不 晓 得 所 说 的 是 什 么 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But they did not take in the sense of any of these words, and what he said was not clear to them, and their minds were not able to see it.
<br>18:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 将 近 耶 利 哥 的 时 候 ， 有 一 个 瞎 子 坐 在 路 旁 讨 饭 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And it came about that when he got near Jericho, a certain blind man was seated by the side of the road, making requests for money from those who went by.
<br>18:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;听 见 许 多 人 经 过 ， 就 问 是 什 么 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And hearing the sound of a great number of people going by, he said, What is this?
<br>18:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 告 诉 他 ， 是 拿 撒 勒 人 耶 稣 经 过 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they said to him, Jesus of Nazareth is going by.
<br>18:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 就 呼 叫 说 ， 大 卫 的 子 孙 耶 稣 阿 ， 可 怜 我 吧 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said in a loud voice, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.
<br>18:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 前 头 走 的 人 ， 就 责 备 他 ， 不 许 他 作 声 。 他 却 越 发 喊 叫 说 ， 大 卫 的 子 孙 ， 可 怜 我 吧 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And those who were in front made protests and said to him, Be quiet: but he said all the more, O Son of David, have mercy on me.
<br>18:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 站 住 ， 吩 咐 把 他 领 过 来 。 到 了 跟 前 ， 就 问 他 说 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus, stopping, gave orders that he was to come to him, and when he came near, he said to him,
<br>18:41&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 要 我 为 你 作 什 么 。 他 说 ， 主 阿 ， 我 要 能 看 见 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;What would you have me do for you? And he said, Lord, that I may be able to see again.
<br>18:42&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 你 可 以 看 见 。 你 的 信 救 了 你 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus said, See again: your faith has made you well.
<br>18:43&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;瞎 子 立 刻 看 见 了 ， 就 跟 随 耶 稣 ， 一 路 归 荣 耀 与 神 。 众 人 看 见 这 事 ， 也 赞 美 神 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And straight away he was able to see, and he went after him, giving glory to God; and all the people when they saw it gave praise to God.
