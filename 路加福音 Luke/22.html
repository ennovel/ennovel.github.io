<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now the feast of unleavened bread was near, which is called the Passover.
<br>22:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;祭 司 长 和 文 士 ， 想 法 子 怎 么 才 能 杀 害 耶 稣 ， 是 因 他 们 惧 怕 百 姓 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the chief priests and the scribes were looking for a chance to put him to death, but they went in fear of the people.
<br>22:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 时 ， 撒 但 入 了 那 称 为 加 略 人 犹 大 的 心 ， 他 本 是 十 二 门 徒 里 的 一 个 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Satan came into Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve.
<br>22:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 去 和 祭 司 长 并 守 殿 官 商 量 ， 怎 么 可 以 把 耶 稣 交 给 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he went away and had a discussion with the chief priests and the rulers, about how he might give him up to them.
<br>22:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 欢 喜 ， 就 约 定 给 他 银 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they were glad, and undertook to give him money.
<br>22:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 应 允 了 ， 就 找 机 会 要 趁 众 人 不 在 跟 前 的 时 候 ， 把 耶 稣 交 给 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he made an agreement with them to give him up to them, if he got a chance, when the people were not present.
<br>22:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;除 酵 节 ， 须 宰 逾 越 羊 羔 的 那 一 天 到 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the day of unleavened bread came, when the Passover lamb is put to death.
<br>22:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 打 发 彼 得 ， 约 翰 ， 说 ， 你 们 去 为 我 们 预 备 逾 越 节 的 筵 席 ， 好 叫 我 们 吃 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, Go and make the Passover ready for us, so that we may take it.
<br>22:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 问 他 说 ， 要 我 们 在 哪 里 预 备 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they said to him, Where are we to get it ready?
<br>22:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 你 们 进 了 城 ， 必 有 人 拿 着 一 瓶 水 迎 面 而 来 。 你 们 就 跟 着 他 ， 到 他 所 进 的 房 子 里 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, When you go into the town you will see a man coming to you with a vessel of water; go after him into the house into which he goes.
<br>22:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;对 那 家 的 主 人 说 ， 夫 子 说 ， 客 房 在 哪 里 ？ 我 与 门 徒 好 在 那 里 吃 逾 越 节 的 筵 席 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And say to the master of the house, The Master says, Where is the guest-room, where I may take the Passover with my disciples?
<br>22:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 必 指 给 你 们 摆 设 整 齐 的 一 间 大 楼 ， 你 们 就 在 那 里 预 备 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he will take you up to a great room with a table and seats: there make ready.
<br>22:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 去 了 ， 所 遇 见 的 ， 正 如 耶 稣 所 说 的 。 他 们 就 预 备 了 逾 越 节 的 筵 席 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they went, and it was as he had said: and they made the Passover ready.
<br>22:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;时 候 到 了 ， 耶 稣 坐 席 ， 使 徒 也 和 他 同 坐 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the time had come, he took his seat, and the Apostles with him.
<br>22:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 我 很 愿 意 在 受 害 以 先 ， 和 你 们 吃 这 逾 越 节 的 筵 席 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said, I have had a great desire to keep this Passover with you before I come to my death;
<br>22:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 告 诉 你 们 ， 我 不 再 吃 这 筵 席 ， 直 到 成 就 在 神 的 国 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For I say to you, I will not take it till it is made complete in the kingdom of God.
<br>22:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 接 过 杯 来 ， 祝 谢 了 ， 说 ， 你 们 拿 这 个 ， 大 家 分 着 喝 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he took a cup and, having given praise, he said, Make division of this among yourselves;
<br>22:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 告 诉 你 们 ， 从 今 以 后 ， 我 不 再 喝 这 葡 萄 汁 ， 直 等 神 的 国 来 到 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For I say to you, I will not take of the fruit of the vine till the kingdom of God has come.
<br>22:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 拿 起 饼 来 祝 谢 了 ， 就 掰 开 递 给 他 们 ， 说 ， 这 是 我 的 身 体 ， 为 你 们 舍 的 。 你 们 也 应 当 如 此 行 ， 为 的 是 记 念 我 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he took bread and, having given praise, he gave it to them when it had been broken, saying, This is my body, which is given for you: do this in memory of me.
<br>22:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;饭 后 也 照 样 拿 起 杯 来 ， 说 ， 这 杯 是 用 我 血 所 立 的 新 约 ， 是 为 你 们 流 出 来 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And in the same way, after the meal, he took the cup, saying, This cup is the new testament, made with my blood which is given for you.
<br>22:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;看 哪 ， 那 卖 我 之 人 的 手 ， 与 我 一 同 在 桌 子 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But the hand of him who is false to me is with me at the table.
<br>22:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;人 子 固 然 要 照 所 预 定 的 去 世 。 但 卖 人 子 的 人 有 祸 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For it will be done to the Son of man after the purpose of God, but unhappy is that man by whom he is given up.
<br>22:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 就 彼 此 对 问 ， 是 哪 一 个 要 作 这 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they were wondering among themselves which of them it was who would do this thing.
<br>22:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;门 徒 起 了 争 论 ， 他 们 中 间 哪 一 个 可 算 为 大 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And there was an argument among them about which of them was the greatest.
<br>22:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 外 邦 人 有 君 王 为 主 治 理 他 们 。 那 掌 权 管 他 们 的 称 为 恩 主 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said, The kings of the Gentiles are lords over them, and those who have authority are given names of honour.
<br>22:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 你 们 不 可 这 样 。 你 们 里 头 为 大 的 ， 倒 要 像 年 幼 的 。 为 首 领 的 ， 倒 要 像 服 事 人 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But let it not be so with you; but he who is greater, let him become like the younger; and he who is chief, like a servant.
<br>22:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;是 谁 为 大 ？ 是 坐 席 的 呢 ？ 是 服 事 人 的 呢 ？ 不 是 坐 席 的 大 吗 ？ 然 而 我 在 你 们 中 间 ， 如 同 服 事 人 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For which is greater, the guest who is seated at a meal or the servant who is waiting on him? is it not the guest? but I am among you as a servant.
<br>22:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 在 磨 炼 之 中 ， 常 和 我 同 在 的 就 是 你 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But you are those who have kept with me through my troubles;
<br>22:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 将 国 赐 给 你 们 ， 正 如 我 父 赐 给 我 一 样 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And I will give you a kingdom as my Father has given one to me,
<br>22:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;叫 你 们 在 我 国 里 ， 坐 在 我 的 席 上 吃 喝 。 并 且 坐 在 宝 座 上 ， 审 判 以 色 列 十 二 个 支 派 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So that you may take food and drink at my table in my kingdom, and be seated like kings, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
<br>22:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;主 又 说 ， 西 门 ， 西 门 ， 撒 但 想 要 得 着 你 们 ， 好 筛 你 们 ， 像 筛 麦 子 一 样 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Simon, Simon, Satan has made a request to have you, so that he may put you to the test as grain is tested:
<br>22:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 我 已 经 为 你 祈 求 ， 叫 你 不 至 于 失 了 信 心 。 你 回 头 以 后 ， 要 坚 固 你 的 弟 兄 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But I have made prayer for you, that your faith may not go from you: and when you are turned again, make your brothers strong.
<br>22:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 说 ， 主 阿 ， 我 就 是 同 你 下 监 ， 同 你 受 死 ， 也 是 甘 心 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.
<br>22:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 彼 得 ， 我 告 诉 你 ， 今 日 鸡 还 没 有 叫 ， 你 要 三 次 说 不 认 得 我 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said, I say to you, Peter, before the cock's second cry today, you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me.
<br>22:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 又 对 他 们 说 ， 我 差 你 们 出 去 的 时 候 ， 没 有 钱 囊 ， 没 有 口 袋 ， 没 有 鞋 ， 你 们 缺 少 什 么 没 有 。 他 们 说 ， 没 有 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, When I sent you out without money or bag or shoes, were you in need of anything? And they said, Nothing.
<br>22:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 但 如 今 有 钱 囊 的 可 以 带 着 ， 有 口 袋 的 也 可 以 带 着 。 没 有 刀 的 要 卖 衣 服 买 刀 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, But now, he who has a money-bag, or a bag for food, let him take it: and he who has not, let him give his coat for money and get a sword.
<br>22:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 告 诉 你 们 ， 经 上 写 着 说 ， 他 被 列 在 罪 犯 之 中 。 这 话 必 应 验 在 我 身 上 ， 因 为 那 关 系 我 的 事 ， 必 然 成 就 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For I say to you that these words will be put into effect in me, And he was numbered among the evil-doers: for what has been said in the Writings about me has an end.
<br>22:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 说 ， 主 阿 ， 请 看 ， 这 里 有 两 把 刀 。 耶 稣 说 ， 够 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they said, Lord, here are two swords. And he said, It is enough.
<br>22:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 出 来 ， 照 常 往 橄 榄 山 去 。 门 徒 也 跟 随 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he came out, and went, as his way was, to the Mountain of Olives, and the disciples went with him.
<br>22:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;到 了 那 地 方 ， 就 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 要 祷 告 ， 免 得 入 了 迷 惑 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he came to the place, he said to them, Make a prayer that you may not be put to the test.
<br>22:41&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 离 开 他 们 ， 约 有 扔 一 块 石 头 那 么 远 ， 跪 下 祷 告 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he went a little distance away from them and, falling on his knees in prayer, he said,
<br>22:42&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;说 ， 父 阿 ， 你 若 愿 意 ， 就 把 这 杯 撤 去 。 然 而 不 要 成 就 我 的 意 思 ， 只 要 成 就 你 的 意 思 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Father, if it is your pleasure, take this cup from me: but still, let your pleasure, not mine, be done.
<br>22:43&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 一 位 天 使 ， 从 天 上 显 现 ， 加 添 他 的 力 量 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And an angel from heaven came to him, to give him strength.
<br>22:44&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 极 其 伤 痛 ， 祷 告 更 加 恳 切 。 汗 珠 如 大 血 点 ， 滴 在 地 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And being in great trouble of soul, the force of his prayer became stronger, and great drops, like blood, came from him, falling to the earth.
<br>22:45&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;祷 告 完 了 ， 就 起 来 ， 到 门 徒 那 里 ， 见 他 们 因 为 忧 愁 都 睡 着 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And, getting up from prayer, he came to the disciples, and saw that they were sleeping for sorrow.
<br>22:46&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 为 什 么 睡 觉 呢 ？ 起 来 祷 告 ， 免 得 入 了 迷 惑 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said, Why are you sleeping? Get up, and give yourselves to prayer, so that you may not be put to the test.
<br>22:47&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;说 话 之 间 ， 来 了 许 多 人 ， 那 十 二 个 门 徒 里 名 叫 犹 大 的 ， 走 在 前 头 ， 就 近 耶 稣 ， 要 与 他 亲 嘴 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And while he was saying these words, there came a band of people, and Judas, one of the twelve, was in front of them, and he came near to Jesus to give him a kiss.
<br>22:48&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 说 ， 犹 大 ， 你 用 亲 嘴 的 暗 号 卖 人 子 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Jesus said to him, Judas, will you be false to the Son of man with a kiss?
<br>22:49&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;左 右 的 人 见 光 景 不 好 ， 就 说 ， 主 阿 ， 我 们 拿 刀 砍 可 以 不 可 以 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when those who were with him saw what was coming, they said, Lord, may we not make use of our swords?
<br>22:50&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;内 中 有 一 个 人 ， 把 大 祭 司 的 仆 人 砍 了 一 刀 ， 削 掉 了 他 的 右 耳 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And one of them gave a blow to the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.
<br>22:51&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 到 了 这 个 地 步 ， 由 他 们 吧 。 就 摸 那 人 的 耳 朵 ， 把 他 治 好 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Jesus, answering, said, Put up with this, at least. And touching his ear, he made it well.
<br>22:52&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 那 些 来 拿 他 的 祭 司 长 ， 和 守 殿 官 ， 并 长 老 ， 说 ， 你 们 带 着 刀 棒 ， 出 来 拿 我 ， 如 同 拿 强 盗 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus said to the chief priests and the captains of the Temple and the rulers, who had come against him, Have you come out as against a thief, with swords and sticks?
<br>22:53&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 天 天 同 你 们 在 殿 里 ， 你 们 不 下 手 拿 我 。 现 在 却 是 你 们 的 时 候 ， 黑 暗 掌 权 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;When I was in the Temple with you every day, your hands were not stretched out against me: but this is your hour, and the authority of the dark power.
<br>22:54&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 拿 住 耶 稣 ， 把 他 带 到 大 祭 司 的 宅 里 。 彼 得 远 远 地 跟 着 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they made him a prisoner and took him away to the house of the high priest. But Peter went after them at a distance.
<br>22:55&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 在 院 子 里 生 了 火 ， 一 同 坐 着 。 彼 得 也 坐 在 他 们 中 间 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And a fire was lighted in the middle of the open square, and they were seated together, and Peter was among them.
<br>22:56&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 一 个 使 女 ， 看 见 彼 得 坐 在 火 光 里 ， 就 定 睛 看 他 ， 说 ， 这 个 人 素 来 也 是 同 那 人 一 伙 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And a certain woman-servant, seeing him in the light of the fire, and looking at him with attention, said, This man was with him.
<br>22:57&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 却 不 承 认 ， 说 ， 女 子 ， 我 不 认 得 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But he said, Woman, it is not true; I have no knowledge of him.
<br>22:58&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;过 了 不 多 的 时 候 ， 又 有 一 个 人 看 见 他 ， 说 ， 你 也 是 他 们 一 党 的 。 彼 得 说 ， 你 这 个 人 ， 我 不 是 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And after a little time, another saw him and said, You are one of them; and he said, Man, I am not.
<br>22:59&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;约 过 了 一 小 时 ， 又 有 一 个 人 极 力 地 说 ， 他 实 在 是 同 那 人 一 伙 的 。 因 为 他 也 是 加 利 利 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And after about an hour, another man said, with decision, Certainly this man was with him, for he is a Galilaean.
<br>22:60&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 说 ， 你 这 个 人 ， 我 不 晓 得 你 说 的 是 什 么 。 正 说 话 之 间 鸡 就 叫 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Peter said, Man, I have no knowledge of these things of which you are talking. And straight away, while he was saying these words, there came the cry of a cock.
<br>22:61&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;主 转 过 身 来 ， 看 彼 得 。 彼 得 便 想 起 主 对 他 所 说 的 话 ， 今 日 鸡 叫 以 先 ， 你 要 三 次 不 认 我 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the Lord, turning, gave Peter a look. And the words of the Lord came to Peter's mind, how he had said, This night, before the hour of the cock's cry, you will be false to me three times.
<br>22:62&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 就 出 去 痛 哭 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he went out, weeping bitterly.
<br>22:63&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;看 守 耶 稣 的 人 戏 弄 他 ， 打 他 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the men in whose hands Jesus was, made sport of him and gave him blows.
<br>22:64&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 蒙 着 他 的 眼 ， 问 他 说 ， 你 是 先 知 ， 告 诉 我 们 ， 打 你 的 是 谁 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And, covering his eyes, they said to him, Are you prophet enough to say who gave you that blow?
<br>22:65&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 还 用 许 多 别 的 话 辱 骂 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they said a number of other evil things against him.
<br>22:66&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;天 一 亮 ， 民 间 的 众 长 老 连 祭 司 长 带 文 士 都 聚 会 。 把 耶 稣 带 到 他 们 的 公 会 里 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when it was day, the rulers of the people came together, with the chief priests and the scribes, and they took him before their Sanhedrin, saying,
<br>22:67&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;说 ， 你 若 是 基 督 ， 就 告 诉 我 们 。 耶 稣 说 ， 我 若 告 诉 你 们 ， 你 们 也 不 信 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;If you are the Christ, say so. But he said, If I say so you will not have belief;
<br>22:68&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 若 问 你 们 ， 你 们 也 不 回 答 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And if I put a question to you, you will not give an answer.
<br>22:69&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;从 今 以 后 ， 人 子 要 坐 在 神 权 能 的 右 边 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But in the future the Son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.
<br>22:70&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 都 说 ， 这 样 ， 你 是 神 的 儿 子 吗 ？ 耶 稣 说 ， 你 们 所 说 的 是 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they all said, Are you then the Son of God? and he said, You say that I am.
<br>22:71&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 说 ， 何 必 再 用 见 证 呢 ？ 他 亲 口 所 说 的 ， 我 们 都 亲 自 听 见 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they said, What more need have we of witness? we have the very words of his mouth.
