Jenny put down her eyeliner and opened the door. "What do you mean? Why not?" Rufus was wearing a child-sized Mets baseball that he'd bought for Dan when he was eight. It sat like a beanie atop a nest of wild and wooly gray hair. He was also wearing blue-and-white-striped elastic-waist cotton pants that looked exactly like pajama bottoms. "Mrs. M and I had a little talk last night," Rufus told her. Uh-oh. Jenny tugged on her super-short seersucker school uniform. "How come?" she asked innocently, even though she knew perfectly well how come. Rufus ignored her Miss I-Didn't-Do-Anything act. "She basically laid it on the line. Either you repeat ninth grade, or next year you're going to school elsewhere." Jenny resisted hurling herself at her father and smothering him in a bear hug. She was going to boarding school! It was really happening! Not so fast, missy. "I'm not going here," Jenny insisted before the cab even stopped. "That's what you think," her father grumbled. He paid the cabbie and opened the door. "Come, Your Tartiness. Let's take a look." They'd pulled up in front of the Sloan Centre for Bright Minds, a hippie experimental school on a flat, wide strip of boring-looking three-story buildings in Flushing, Queens. It was miles away from Manhattan and nothing like the ivy-trimmed brick buildings of the boarding school of her dreams. On the way over Rufus had shoved a Sloan Centre brochure at her, and she'd thumbed through it. There was no real dress code, the lunchroom was organic and vegetarian, the students all had greasy hair and acne, and none of the teachers wore Chanel suits. In other words, jenny hated it already. A giant birchbark peace sign greeted them as they passed through the biodynamically grown natural oak school doors. The peace sign was hanging from the ceiling of the entryway, spinning round and round in the breeze created by the student-built watermill standing at the base of the stairs. Pure spring water cascaded down a bamboo gutter at the centre of the stairs, feeding the mill. "Our upper-schoolers built the water mill last winter," explained Calliope Trask, the school's director, at the start of their tour. "Every January we have what's called Winter Work. There are no academics, and the students focus on building something functional with their hands. The year before we had a chicken coop with twenty laying hens, right here in out gym. We had so many eggs we had an egg scale and raised money to buy new hemp mats for our pre-schoolers to nap on! Woo-hoo! Calliope Trask's hair hung in a gray braid down to her bottom and she was wearing a mustard-yellow-linen Eileen Fisher tank dress that did wonders for her frizzy black underarm hair. Her legs were unshaven too, and coarse black leg hairs stuck out between the straps of her tied-at-the-ankle beige canvas Earth shoes. "Those are wonderful sunglasses." She pointed at the gigantic pair of pink Gucci shades masking Jenny's smoldering brown eyes. "But at Bright Minds we don't allow designer labels or emblems on clothing or accessories of any sort." Before Jenny could even say, "What the fuck?" Rufus had whipped the glasses off her face and stuck them in his gray sweatpants-material jacket pocket. "That's better. Now we can see your beautiful face," Calliope trilled, as Jenny scowled hideously at her. She followed Calliope and her father up the stairs, tempted to tell them both to take the Sloan Centre for Bright Minds' hemp mats and smoke them while she ran away to the Czech Republic to live wither crazy, selfish, and neglectful mother. The Raves could do a tour of Eastern Europe and she could buy all the Gucci she wanted for half-price on the black market. They reached the second floor and Calliope opened the door to of the classrooms. "Our classes are mixed-age and broken up into 'bundles' names for the endangered species of the Galapagos. Jennifer, you'd be in one of the thirteen-to-fifteen-year-old bundles. I'll walk you to the area where the Giant Tortoise bundle is gathered for this mornings work and then let your student guide take over." The floor of the classroom was covered in sand, the walls were lined with stalks of bamboo, and the ceiling was plastered with palm fronds. NO SMOKING, read a huge hand-painted sign overhead. Jenny had never really been much of a smoker, but she was dying for a cigarette. She pulled off her white Miss Sixty cardigan to reveal the cute little Lacoste alligator marching across the left boob of her new pink shirt, given to her by Lloyd Collins of the Raves. Anything to avoid becoming a Giant Tortoise. "Hakuna matata, Miss. Calliope," a pudgy girl wearing what looked like a goatskin bikini greeted them. "Hakuna matata, Cherisse," Calliope replied with a smile. "The Giant Tortoise bundle is exploring the country of Namibia in Africa this week," she told Jenny and Rufus, as if that explained everything. Jenny stared as the rest of the Giant Tortoises- five greasy-haired, pudgy, crooked-tooth girls and three skinny, glasses-wearing, acne-ridden boys- all wearing some form of goatskin clothing that might have been stylish is it had been designed by Stella McCartney instead of Hippies R Us. They stood in a circle, their hands joined as they sang a Namibian rain chant. Even Rufus looked a little startled. "Do you have any data on where your graduates go to college?" he asked, sounding a lot like the parents of Jenny's Constance Billard classmates. Although he'd never admit it, Rufus was deadly serious about the whole college admission thing and had nearly opened all of Dan's acceptance letters before he even got home from school. He may have been an anarchist, but he was a strong believer in formal education. Calliope frowned. "We try to keep our school as non-competitive as possible. Our students are encouraged to take some time off and explore the world. Live off the grid. Once they decided what their calling is, they may or may not seek further training." Whatever the hell that meant. "I hear you're an artist." Cherisse smiled at Jenny with crooked yellow teeth. "Come, I'll show you our mural. It's done entirely in buck's dung." Rufus held Jenny's hand protectively as Cherisse led them over to a bizarre mural of elephants and zebras cavorting in the grass. Cherisse dipped her hands into a clay bowl on the floor and smeared something brown on the back of one of the elephants. Rufus shook his head tiredly and pulled Jenny over to a table in the corner of the room, where he sat down. He loved the idea of an alternative school, but deep down he wanted his daughter to graduate from Berkeley or Columbia, not wander around the world painting murals with deer shit. Jenny sat down across from him and pulled a vial of Chanel Vamp nail polish out of her pink DKNY hobo bag. "So why are we here again?" she demanded. She unscrewed the vial and began painting her nails. Rufus readjusted his baseball cap and rubbed his bleary eyes, looking like he needed about six more hours of sleep and three more cups of coffee. "Look, Jen," he told her earnestly. "You can't just shack up with rock stars in hotels and lie to your father all the time. But I want you to be happy. What do you want to do?" Jenny screwed the top back on her nail polish and put it back in her purse. She knew her dad wasn't going to like what she had to say, because he secretly adored having a house full of crazy kids to embarrass and infuriate. But the only way she was going to give up her career as a Raves groupie was if she got to go away to school, where the opportunities for adventure were limitless. Hey, he'd said it himself: He wanted her to be happy. Across the room Calliope Trask was helping the Giant Tortoise fling buck's dung at the mural, Jackson Pollock-style. Jenny looked up at her dear father with hopeful doe-brown eyes, her red mouth forming the shape of a heart as she murmured eight melodic words: "Dad, may I please go to boarding school?"
