"Then you should have applied early admission," Stan 5 advised. "But you don't understand. I kissed my interviewer," Blair whispered loudly, sounding like a broken record. "My college advisor said there was no way she'd take me early." Stan 5 shrugged. "Smaller pool of applicants. Better chance to shine." Blair gritted her teeth to hold back a volley of expletives. She'd planned on applying to Yale early admission since she was thirteen years old. Why had she listened to clueless, bloody-nosed, wig-wearing Ms. Glos and not trusted her instincts? And why hadn't she met Stan 5 like, a year ago, when he could have been really useful? They were lying on their stomachs on the double bed in the room Stan 5's grandfather kept for him, and had already thumbed through every Yale catalog since 1947, laughing at the clothes people wore and the corny phrases underneath the photos. Things like, "Here's looking at you kid!" and "Ain't nobody here but us chickens!" The room was decorated with Yale paraphernalia: Yale swim team pennants, Stan III's B.A. in English and dramatic arts, a New Haven newspaper article featuring Stan III as one of Yale's most gifted young actors, and a yellow card from the Yale University registrar listing every semester old Stan had made the dean's list. "It looks like your grandfather's whole life," Blair observed. Her shoes where half on, half off, and she bounced them up and down on the ends of her toes. Stan 5 rolled over and looked at the ceiling. "Yeah," he answered hollowly. Blair wasn't sure why he sounded so bummed. After all, Yale was her whole life too, but she was the one still stuck on the wait list. Stan 5 reached out and twirled a strand of Blair's dark hair around his finger. "We should stop talking about this," he told her letting the twirl go, "Or you're going to get serisouly depressed." "But-" Blair started to say. Exactly when were they going to devise a plan to get her into Yale? Stan 5 rolled over and grabbed her arms, pulling her toward him. "We should stop talking period," he said, his eyes hungrily searching her face. "Like I said, my grandfather and I are really close. So don't worry about getting in, okay?" This was the part in the movie where the music was supposed to slow down, heads were supposed to meet, and boy and girl were supposed to kiss so passionately that their clothes would wind up in a pile on the floor while the windows steamed up. Stan 5 was going to get her into Yale! But for some reason- maybe it was the quantity of Yale paraphernalia on the walls and all over the floor, or maybe it was because she'd drunk four glasses of champagne at a party she hadn't been invited to, or maybe it was because kissing any other boy other than Nate felt truly naughty- Blair couldn't manage to close her eyes and kiss Stanford Parris V. All she could do was snort and giggle like a twelve-year-old. She pushed him away, snorting and giggling so hard she chocked. "What?" Stan 5 asked, pushing himself up on his elbows. His blond hair fell into his eyes and he pushed it away. Blair snorted again. She felt giddy and confused and very much in need of a little girl talk with Serena. "I don't know." She got up and jammed her feet into her shoes. "Um, I have to go find someone. Maybe I'll see you later?" Stan 5 seemed to enjoy how hot and bothered she was. He grinned cockily at her and raised his blond eyebrows. "Maybe." As she left the room, Blair tried to pull herself together. Not maybe. Definitely. THE WOMEN ARE SMARTER "I never really thought of Hamlet as a tragedy per se," Serena found herself telling Stanford Parris III. She'd only skimmed Hamlet when they had to write an essay on it for English class, but she'd always been an excellent bullshit artist. Even without reading every word she'd noticed that Hamlet reminded her of Dan Humphrey, who she'd hooked up with earlier in the fall. So woeful and neurotic. "I mean, all he needed was a little Zoloft or something and he's probably have conquered all of Scandinavia and had, like, a wife in every country." Well, hello, Miss I Know All There Is To Know About Shakespeare. Mr. Parris nodded. "Wellbutrin. That's what I take." Like she really needed to know that. "I like reading," Serena went on, completely bemused by what was coming out of her mouth. "As long as I have nothing else to do," she corrected herself. Which was almost never. "I guess that's the trouble I'm going to have, you know, with picking a major? I won't be able to decide between English and drama." She smiled and pulled her short skirt demurely over her knees. Since when is the cities biggest party girl worried about her major? "Elementary, my dear. That's why they invented the double major!" Mr. Parris snapped his suspenders, obviously delighted with the opportunity to divulge his vast wisdom to a young girl of such extraordinary beauty and intelligence. All of a sudden Blair burst into the room, dressed a little too sexily for an academic gathering and wearing the Yale pendant her mother had ordered from Cartier for baby Yale. Serena had never seen her best friend look so bizarre. "Thank God I found you!" Blair babbled breathlessly. She glanced at Mr. Parris. "Sorry for interrupting, sir, but this is an emergency!" Serena could always tell when Blair was up to something or was just plain freaking out, because her nostrils flared like a wild animal and she forgot to blink. Right now she looked like a squirrel with rabies. Serena stood up and shook Mr. Paris's hand. "It was truly a pleasure talking to you, Mr. Paris." Mr. Parris bent down and kissed her hand. "The pleasure is entirely mine." Blair coughed. Of course Serena had completely enchanted the old man, which was totally unfair because Blair was the one who actually needed to enchant him, "This really is an emergency," she blurted impatiently. Not exactly enchanting. "Okay, I'm coming," Serena murmured. She looped her arm through Blair's and Blair dragged her t o the front hall and pushed the button for the elevator. "Where are we going anyway?" Serena demanded as the elevator doors rolled open. "The Plaza!" Blair squealed, dragging her inside. And it'd probably safe to say they weren't going to discuss Shakespeare once they got there. AND YOU THOUGHT ANDY WARHOL WAS DEAD Vanessa and Beverly walked up an enclosed ramp that led into the warehouse space in Williamsburg where Beverly's friends' party was taking place. Vanessa could hear music coming from inside- something airy and rhythmic that might have been Bjork, although she wasn't sure. A woman pushed open the black metal door at the top of the ramp and stomped past wearing a yellow bandana in her hair, black knee socks, and fluorescent yellow clogs. She looked like she'd been crying, and was cradling her left hand against her chest. "Hey, Bethene," Beverly called to her as she stomped away. "What are those?" Vanessa peered into a bucket of what she hoped were very well produced stuffed animals, sitting on the floor halfway up the ramp. "Kittens," Beverly replied, as if no further explanation was required. The ramp seemed to be fashioned as a sort of display, and was scattered with random art objects. Besides the bucket of kittens was a life sized wax figure of Santa Claus carrying a huge see-through plastic sack full of naked Barbie dolls with their heads missing. At Santa's face was a lava lamp with real-looking eyeballs floating around inside it. The ramp was like a haunted house only more disturbing. Slightly? "Everyone here is an artist," Beverly declared, "and they've been doing this party since March." Vanessa nodded, even though she wasn't exactly sure what he meant by "doing this party." It sounded a little like the art "happenings" at Andy Warhol's factory back in the 1960's- lots of cool arty people collaborating to make weird art that no one really understood and that wasn't even very good. When they reached the top of the ramp, Beverly pushed the door open and they stepped inside. The space was a giant warehouse, cool and dark, except the glow from four giant lava lamps like they'd seen on the way in. No one greeted them, and Vanessa was surprised to find only about thirty people there. They sat cross-legged on the floor in little clusters, finger-painting on the pages of encyclopedias and looking completely spaced out, like they hadn't slept since the party started back in March. No one was drinking anything or eating anything or even talking. It was sort of like an anti-party party. Vanessa watched as a women wearing a fuzzy red bathrobe and red rubber rain boots chopped off a handful of her long dark hair and dropped it into a huge pot sitting on a hotplate on the floor. A tall, pale skinny guy wearing only a black fedora hat and black boxer shorts went up to the pot and stired it with a wooden yardstick. "Bruce," Beverly greeted the guy with a nod. "This is Vanessa. She makes films." Bruce nodded and kept on nodding for longer than normal as he stirred the pot. Vanessa wished desperately that she had her video camera with her. She'd never seen anything quite like this. "Are you here to make a donation?" Bruce asked. Vanessa wasn't sure who he was talking to. In fact, for the first time in her life, she felt completely lost. Every party she'd ever been to had been predictable to the point of being hopelessly boring. She smiled tentatively at Beverly. It was sort of nice to be surprised. The music suddenly shifted to the soundtrack for 'Shrek 2' and Vanessa felt more lost than ever. She took a step forward and peered into Bruce's pot. "What is that anyway?" Bruce held up his left hand and wiggled his fingers. The top joint on the middle finger of his left hand was missing, just like Beverly's. "I'm working on a regeneration project," Bruce said, as if that explained everything. Beverly held up his left hand and spread his fingers out like a fan. No, Vanessa wasn't going insane. His middle finger really was missing its top. "Most of us have contributed. But there's no pressure or anything." Well, isn't that a relief? Vanessa wasn't easily creeped out, but she was getting close. "And what do you do with the... parts and stuff... in the pot... after they're like, cooked or whatever?" Bruce grinned and his blue veins stood out on his pale neck. He looked like he hadn't eaten in months. "It's not about the doing; it's about the stirring," he responded. Beverly nodded in that same odd, prolonged way that Bruce had nodded before. "Vanessa's got a great space," he volunteered, apropos of nothing. "I'm thinking of crashing there for awhile. It'd be great for something like this," he added still nodding. All of a sudden Vanessa realized that looking for roommates on the internet probably wasn't such a great idea. Beverly had seemed interesting at first, she'd almost rather live with Dan, despite all his failings, or one of her spoiled, vain, fashion-obsessed classmates than come home to boiling fingers who knew what else on her stove. It was one thing to make art that people thought was shocking and bizarre without actually trying to be shocking and bizarre. Beverly and his friends were in college- hadn't they learned anything? "Are you thirsty?" Beverly asked her. "Do you want some water?" Vanessa realized that was just the nicest thing he'd said to her all night. She couldn't believe she'd been worried about the configuration of her moles, or that she'd actually worn perfume for him. She yawned and glanced around the enormous space. "I'm not sure how much of this I can take," she responded, mimicking what Beverly had said about Dan's singing in the club. "I'm going home." Beverly bit his lip. "But this is working. I mean- so far, right?" he asked. "Actually, it's not." Vanessa imitated the sweet, fake smile her classmate Blair Waldorf flashed, telepathically telling the teacher to eat shit and die when she was trying to get excused from class early to attend a Manolo Blahnik sale. "Sure you don't want to make a donation?" Bruce asked still stirring the pot. Vanessa unclipped her lip ring and tossed it in. "Good luck with that," she told them, turning to go. Beverly and Bruce began to nod. As far as we know, they're still nodding.
