For a pool house, it was really quite big. It contained a Ping-Pong table, two king-sized ivory leather sleeper sofas, and a fish tank with a live barracuda in it. Not to mention the steam room and the bathroom that had to be around here somewhere. Someone had clearly been into Mr. Coates's pot stash, because Apollo's head was rolling around underneath the Ping-Pong table like an oversized Ping- Pong ball. Next to the fish tank was a white door with a picture of a little blue boy and a little pink girl holding hands decoupaged onto it. Serena pushed it open. Inside, the bathroom was decorated in gold leaf and had one of those weird low sinks you always see in European hotels but that no one ever uses. Because they're for washing your butt, which is beyond gross? The shower curtain was made of clear plastic decorated with gold stars. Behind it, sitting inside the tub with Mr. Coates's pot stash cradled in his lap, his clothes damp with sea water, and his eyes all red and sleepy, was Nate Archibald- the famously missing Nate. Serena pulled the shower curtain aside and climbed in the tub, clutching her towel around her. "Natie? What are you doing here? Why weren't you on the boat?" Nate grinned foolishly. Serena was naked except for a white towel wrapped around her torso. It was impossible not to smile at her; she looked like a Greek goddess. Her forehead was damp, and her blond hair was matted with sweat, but she was still gorgeous. Beyond gorgeous. She pulled her hair up on top of her head and fanned her face. "God, I'm hot." Of course, Nate was thinking the same thing. "I'm not supposed to be here," Nate confided idiotically. "The sign said, NO BOYS ALLOWED."
