A STAR IS BORN AND SHE COULDN'T CARE LESS Remember a few months back when a certain shaven-headed, Brooklyn dwelling, filmmaking genius won her school film contest? The prize was a trip to Cannes Film Festival to compete for the Most Promising New Filmmaker award. Any normal girl would have been shopping for the right dress, the right shoes, the right hairstyle, the right escort, as soon as she'd found out that she'd won. She would have been counting the days. Winning the award would be like being queen for a day. Not that our filmmaking genius friend even cares. She skipped the whole thing, and festival MC and independent filmmaker Ken Mogul had to accept the award on her behalf, calling her "the most original voice in filmmaking, since Charlie Chapman." Not necessarily a compliment, since Charlie Chapman made silent films. Still, it's not every day that thousands of fabulously dresses celebrities rise to their feet to applaud you. Most of us would have wanted to be there. One thing's for sure, she'd not in it for the clothes or the fame- something I find impossible to understand! NOW ABOUT HER FILM... Remember a few months back when a certain shaven-headed filmmaker was camped out in the park, interviewing any senior kid who was willing to talk about schools they'd gotten into or not gotten into and how their lives sucked or didn't suck? Well guess what film won the New Filmmaker award in Cannes? Do we dare show our faces in France ever again? Your e-mail: Q: Dear GG, I was wait-listed at Yale and I just got a letter from them this morning. A rejection letter. I heard no one's getting of the wait list cuz everyone who applied is going. 2 bad 4 me. -dumdum A: Dear dumdum, You are so not a dumdum for not getting in. Your guidance councilor wouldn't let you apply if she didn't think you had a chance. I know lots of crazily smart people who didn't get in, and some dumdums who did. Anyway, does this mean everyone who's on the wait list will be hearing back this week? Guess we'll find out soon enough... -GG Q: Dear GG Please tell me how to win back the heart of the boy I love. He is depressed because his father won't let him go out of the house because he is being punished for a crime. But I love him and I must see him or I will die. -tristesse A: Dear tristesse, I take it English is not your first language. Let me put it into simple terms: maybe the boy in question isn't as into you as you are into him, n'est ce pas? -GG Sightings: B and S at the Five and Dime in Williamsburg on movie night, drinking cosmos and lip-synching along with Audrey Hepburn in Charade. V and A at the Mousy Brown salon in Williamsburg. Tell me he's not getting his head shaved to match hers! K and I making laminated NO BOYS ALLOWED signs at an Upper East Side Kinko's. Silly girls don't they know that's just asking for trouble? A dark-haired French girl in a fringed Prada poncho and a Fendi moccasins scaling the walls of N's East-Side town house. He certainly has a penchant for crazy women. J and the rest of the Raves, on the lead singer's roof, singing her heart out in the middle of the night- Sunday night, that is. Guess who spent the whole weekend partying at a certain rock star's house? Now there's a girl who'd in it for the fame. Is she trying to get her face in the papers, or does it just come naturally to her? Now we have something to talk about in school on Monday- as if we're ever lacking things to talk about! P.S Thursday night is the long-awaited Archibald Benefit Cruise to the Hamptons. Don't forget to bring your monogrammed Louis Vuitton life jacket! You know you love me, Gossip Girl
