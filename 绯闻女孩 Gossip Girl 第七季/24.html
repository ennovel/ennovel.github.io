She hitched up her towel. "What is it?" she asked Aaron impatiently. Aaron stood up and patted his army shorts pockets. "I've got it," he explained. "At least I hope it's still there." He fumbled around for a moment and then produced what looked like a damp envelope. Blair squeezed her eyes shut and then opened them again. She was pretty sure she knew what the envelope contained. "And you've had that for exactly how long?" she demanded furisouly before snatching it out of his hand. Aaron shrugged innocently. "It just came this morning." Even through the steam Blair could see the familiar royal blue of Yale's insignia printed in the upper-left-hand corner of the envelope. The dampness made the letter disintegrate as she attempted to pry it open with shaking, impatient hands. "Fuck it," she breathed and ripped it open with her teeth. A single, flimsy, bitten-into piece of paper was folded up inside. Her life had been hanging in the balance for months now. It was hard to believe it all depended on this. The others waited with respectful silence. Dear Blair Waldorf, After much consideration we are happy to offer you a place at Yale University this coming fall... Blair clutched the piece of paper to her chest and tore out of the steam room. "Serena!" she shrieked, dashing across the pool house and heading straight for the bathroom. She yanked open the soon, expecting to see her friend perched innocently on the toilet. Inside, a tangle of familiar, gorgeous, naked limbs, greeted her from the bathtub. Nate and Serena blinked stupidly up at her, their golden heads only inches apart. "We were celebrating," Serena stammered. She climbed out of the tub, her towel clutched ineffectually around her naked body, and pointed at the soggy piece of paper in Blair's hand. "What's that?" she asked in a desperate attempt to change the subject. Blair felt like washing out Serena's perfectly angelic mouth in the Coates's' stupid bidet. "Yale accepted me. Finally." She narrowed her eyes. "As if you cared." Nate staggered to his feet, spilling the giant bag of pot all over the bathtub and ripping the shower curtain off the rail as he tried to find his balance. Infuriating as it was, he was still as handsome as ever. His golden brown hair was wavy from wind and salt air, and his cheeks were flushed from sun and pot and kissing Serena. And his bare chest- it made Blair feel ill to look at it. "Hey, you know, that's what we were just talking about," he fumbled, his tongue heavy with a mixture of pot, confusion and guilt. "Me and Serena, and now you too. We're all going to Yale- all three of us!" Whoopee! "Thanks for telling me," Blair snapped. She'd imagined sharing a celebratory bottle of champagne with Serena on the Coates' private beach. Then she'd give in and call Nate's cell and he'd kidnap her from the party and make wild love to her on some other beach. So much for her imagination. Nate was still standing in the bathtub, his bare feet sprinkled with pot. She reached out and turned the shower nozzle on full blast, raining freezing cold water all over his head. Then yanked off Serena's towel and tucked it under her arm, slamming the door on their lying, cheating faces as she left the bathroom. Lexique or whatever her the fuck her name was drifted into the pool house in her annoying Missoni tunic, her braids bouncing against her braless breasts, just as Blair was headed out the door. "He's in der, yes? My lover, my Nate?" Blair bared her teeth with evil satisfaction. "Oh yes. He's waiting for you in the bathroom," she told the stupid French bitch, slamming the pool house door behind her and making a beeline for the poolside bar. There seemed to be more guys under the tent than girls. Damian, Lloyd and Marc from the Raves were mingling with the Constance Billard seniors, handing out cigars and copies of their new single, "Twisted Little Sister," starring none other than Jenny Humphrey on vocals. The girls had taken off their T-shirts and were all wearing bright, pastel-colored bikini tops, looking like extras in one of those Elivis beach movies. Chuck Bass was trying to talk to Rain Hoffstetter, Laura Salmon, Kati Farkas and Isabel Coates into joining him at military school. "It doesn't really matter where you go to school. What matters is how much fun you have," Blair heard him say. "Just think how fabulous it would be if we were all together!" Blair wentover to the bar, grabbed a half-full bottle of Absolut,a dn carried it over to the pool. "Hey, no glass around the pool!" Isabel shouted through her bullhorn. Blair ignored ger andclimbed up the ladder to the highdive. She let her towel drop, and padded to the end of the diving board. A naked diva in a diamond-studded turban, swigging her favorite beverage. Ignoring the shocked murmurs of her classmates and the delighted jeers of the guys beneath the tent, Blair took a moment to rewind. She and Nate were obviously over- again, and so were she and Serena- again. She was living in Brooklyn of all places, with Vanessa, a shaven-headed girl she'd never spoken to until a week ago. And she was finally, finally into Yale. Most of her life had been an endless loop of repetition, filled with the same people, parties and predictability. Even her dreams had been predictable, and she liked it like that. Now she wasn't sure what to expect. She lifted the bottle to her lips and took a giant swig before setting it carefully down on the diving board. Then she raised her arms up straight as arrows, stood on tiptoe, and dove in. holding her breath, she glided beneath the blue-green water, delighting in the silence. Behind her, the diamond studded turban bobbed to the surface. When she really thought about it, this whole year had been a series of highs and lows, with more lows than highs. But so what if her life wasn't turning out the way she'd imagined it in the movie in her head, and her entire supporting cast had turned out to be assholes? She was about to move the film to a completely new location and could hire an entire new cast. And nobody knew how to steal the show better than Blair did. Her dark hair broke the surface with a dramatic noisy splash. The others stared, tittering underneath the tent, but Blair paid them no mind. Floating on her back, she chanted a goofy little rhyme to cheer herself up. "Two, four, six, eight only nineteen days till I graduate!" Gossipgirl.net HEY PEOPLE!
