Serena buried her face in one of the Plaza's fluffy king-sized goose-down pillows and began making out with it. "Oh baby," she cooed. "Your lips are so amazing." Blair chucked a pillow at the back of Serena's head. "Have you been listening to me?" she demanded. "I said I almost kissed Stanford parries the Fifth!" Serena turned her head to one side and blew her hair out of her face. She'd taken off her skirt, and her white cotton underwear sagged halfway down her skinny ass. "So why didn't you?" "I don't know." Blair untied the gold Cartier Yale pendant from around her neck and threw it on the bedside table. Then she yanked her dress off over her head, stripping down to her underwear. She pulled on one of the Plaza's white terry robes and cracked open a can of coke. "I wanted to, but I couldn't stop laughing. And then I felt stupid, so I left." Serena rolled over and started poking her nonexistent stomach fat. Don't you think it's weird that we're friends and we're attracted to such different guys? I mean, I thought he was totally stuck-up." Attracted to such different guys? Is that why they both lost their virginity to the same guy? Not that either of them wanted to wreck their friendship again by bringing that up. Blair burped noisily. "You think everyone's stuck-up. And actually I think he was sort of embarrassed about being into Yale after I told him I was wait-listed. He's only, like a C student at Andover. He doesn't even any APs. The only reason he got in was because of his grandfather." Serena's eyes opened wide. She was a B+ student and didn't take any APs either, but she'd gotten in. And while talking to Mr. Parris she'd basically decided once and for all that Yale was the school for her. Did she dare tell Blair and ruin a perfectly good time together in their own hotel suite? Blair burped again and Serena thumped her frosted pink polished toes against the mattress, thinking. Nah, she decided. Besides she was suspected that the only reason Blair was so hung up on Stan 5 was because she thought he might help her get into Yale. That's the problem with best friends. Sometimes they know you better than you know yourself. "Hey, let's make prank calls!" Serena cried, desperate to change the subject. She sat up and grabbed the phone, stabbing giddily at the keypad. "Hello? Concierge? Could you please send a plumber to room 448? There's a terrible... er... problem with the toilet. Get what I'm saying? Great. Thank you." She dialed another number. "Sir? Is this room 448? Yes, this is the concierge. I just wanted to let you know that male escort you ordered is on his way up." Then she dialed one of the suites down the hall. "Daddy, I can't sleep," she said in a baby voice "Sing me a song." The guy on the other end started singing the Raves song "ice Cream". He sounded exactly like Damian. Hmm, wonder why? "Wow, you're really good," Serena breathed in her baby voice. "I love you, Daddy,' she cooed, and then hung up. She turned to Blair. "Okay, that was dumb." Blair didn't say anything. She still couldn't believe she chickened out with Stan 5. It was only a kiss, and it wasn't like Nate even cared who she kissed, because he seemed to have totally forgotten about her. All of a sudden there was a knock at the door. "Shit!" Serena squealed, diving under the covers. "It's the Concierge!" Blair tightened the belt on her bathrobe and padded over to the door. "Who is it?" she called out, touching the door with her nervous fingertips. "It's me," Nate's voice answered. Blair jumped backwards as if she'd been electrocuted. She tugged on the belt of the bathrobe again. "Who?" she demanded irritably, even though she knew perfectly well who it was. "It's me Nate," he called through the closed door. "Can I come in?" "Psst!" Serena whispered from the bed. "Pretend I'm Stan 5!" Blair turned around to find Serena sprawled facedown on the bed under the duvet, her long legs spread wide, her hair hidden discreetly under a pillow, and her rather large feet sticking out at the end of the bed. She totally passed for a guy. Even the rumpled little gray skirt on the floor could easily have been a pair of boxers. Serena lifted her had and grinned devilishly. Blair giggled and waved her back into place. Then she opened the door, but only about four inches. "Now's not really a good time," she whispered mysteriously. Nate looked disheveled and tired. In fact, she was pretty sure he was wearing exactly the same faded black T-shirt and khakis that he'd been wearing when she'd left his house the afternoon before, and his hair was definitely dirty, because ethere was no gold highlights in it. It just looked brown. Also, there was dark brown crap between his teeth, like brownie crumbs. Pr pre-chewed Oreos. "I need to take a shower," Nate yawned. "Well, you can't do it here." Blair insisted. She readjusted her bathrobe to insinuate she was naked underneath. Then she took a step backward so Nate could see into the room. "I'm busy." She watched as Nate's gaze traveled from the gold-and-white-painted door across the golden beige carpet to the bed. Two nights ago she would have grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and hurled him on top of the covers so she could ravage his ridiculously hot body and he could ravage hers, just like they'd been doing since she decided to go all the way. But he hadn't called her in two whole days and he really needed to brush his teeth. He'd missed his chance. From beneath the covers, Serena did her best imitation of a studly postsex snore. Blair clenched her teeth to keep from smiling. Actually she didn't much feel like smiling. She was too pissed off at Nate. Nate pressed his palms against his cheeks like he was trying to hold his face together. He'd been counting on staying with Blair tonight a) because she was in a hotel suite and it would be awesome to take a nice hot shower, and have lots of sex, take a bubble bath, order tons of room service, and watch movies until they fell asleep in each others arms; b) because he really didn't want to go home and endure the wrath of Admiral Archibald. He'd definitely be grounded, which meant he wouldn't be bale to go out at all for the rest of his life, and he'd probably never see Blair again; and c) because he was fooling around with Lexie he'd realized that he really didn't enjoy kissing anyone but Blair anymore. Well, maybe he should have thought of that, like, yesterday. Serena kicked her foot and bellowed through her nose like a sleeping elephant. Who the fuck is that anyway? Nate was dying to ask, but the thought of knowing who it was made him press his hands against his face even harder. His gaze shifted back to Blair, who looked like she was bored with whatever game they were playing. "I was on the boat," he started to explain. "I lost my phone." Then he realized that didn't really explain anything. Sometimes it just sucks to be you, doesn't it? "Go home, Nate," Blair dismissed him. "Your parents are looking for you." Nate let go of his face, stuffed his hands into his pockets and took a step backwards towards the elevators. Chocolate Oreo gunk was smeared on the crotch of his pants. He was a mess. "You haven't heard anything from Yale yet, have you?" he asked in a lame effort to find some common ground. "No," she responded coldly. Nate waited for her to say something more but she didn't. Instead, Blair stretched her arms over her head and yawned lazily, like she'd been having so much sex with the big, hot, studly man in her bed she couldn't even talk. "Why don't you e-mail me or something?" she told Nate, and reached for the door handle. As if she and Nate ever communicated by e-mail. When you saw someone naked every day for hours after school, it was hardly necessary to e-mail them. The corners of Nate's mouth drooped like he was about to cry. Blair wasn't breaking up with him officially- she never did, which is why they'd been breaking up and getting back together on and off for the last three years. But that was before they'd become as intimate as you can be with someone, and now there was some random guy in Blair's bed. "Okay. Have a good day at school tomorrow." "See you," Blair closed the door and leaned against it. "He's gone," she whispered. Serena lifted her head and her pale blond hair cascaded all over the bed. "That was fun," she observed, but the way she said it made it sound like a question. Blair went over and sat down on the end of the bed. "Really fun," she agreed hollowly. The girls' eyes met. Neither of them was smiling. Then Serena giggles. "I guess it would have been more fun if I'd really been Stan 5." Blair didn't say anything. She'd basically just broken up with Nate- again- after passing up a perfectly good opportunity to fool around with a boy who could very well get her into Yale. Well, one thing was for sure: She wasn't about to let Stan 5 get away. Serena threw back the covers and grabbed the leather bound room service menu from beside the table. "Let's order filet mignons and French fries and beer and watch old movies!" She'd always been an expert at changing the subject. Blair scooted her feet up underneath her and reached for the TV remote. There might be an Audrey Hepburn movie on TCM or AMC. She flicked through the channels hopefully. Aha! 'My Fair Lady'. Well, at least that was something. Serena lit a Merit Ultra Light, took a puff, and then stuck it in Blair's mouth. The n she picked up the phone massaging Blair's shoulders as she ordered nearly everything on the Plaza Hotel's room service menu. Maybe life sucked for some people, but Serena wouldn't let it suck for them. TWO DOORS DOWN, A SUITE GETS TRASHED Just down the hall, in an even bigger suite, Dan, Jenny, two members of the Raves, and a very tan French girl were lounging round smoking cigars that had been FedExed to the room from Cuba that day. The whole room was filled with ripped-open FedEx boxes: Peaches from Georgia, candles from France, Vodka from Finland, strong brown ale from Ireland, breadsticks from Italy, shower gel from LA, and extra-sharp cheddar cheese from Vermont. As if you couldn't buy all of the above in the city that has everything. Lloyd asked the concierge to send up more bathrobes, and one by one they all removed their clothes and donned robes. Jenny wasn't quite sure what to do with her pants and shirt, and it was nearly impossible to hide her bra, because the bathrobe had the troublesome habit of popping outward in the cleavage area. She decided to stuff her clothes into the gold-and-white vanity cupboard under the bathroom sink and cinched the belt of the bathrobe as tight as it would go before stepping out into the suite once more. "Have a peach," Damian offered in his adorable Irish accent. He pulled one of the perfectly ripened fruit out of the box and held it up. He'd changed into a robe, and Jenny wondered if he was still wearing his underwear. The thought made her cheeks turn red and her bathrobe pop open once more. Damian patted the seat cushion of the gold damask loveseat he was sitting on. "Come, sit down. Eat one of these and then show me how badly you can kick my ass at Terminator." Jenny glanced at the selection of PlayStation games on the coffee table. Kick his ass? She'd never played a video game in her life. "Or would you prefer something more refined, like a fine Italian breadstick?" Lloyd asked from the sofa on the other side of the coffee table. He drummed two breadsticks on his knees. "They're excellent with ale. Just dunk," he explained, dipping an entire breadstick into a bottle of Irish ale, "and munch." Then he patted the seat cushion next to him just like Damian had done. "Try it." Unable to decide between which guy was cuter, Jenny sliced a tiny piece of cheddar cheese of the huge brick of it on the coffee table and knelt down on the floor. Monique was sitting on the floor too, smoking a hand-rolled cigarette and reading a French magazine and looking bored because Dan had gone to the bathroom to shower and change into his robe. "Ooh la la, I just realized who you are!" Monique squealed, ashing on the floor in her excitement. "You're zee model in zee fantastique W pages. I love zohze photos. And zat blond girl- so beautiful, non?" "Well, you're even prettier," Jenny responded shyly, thrilled to be recognized. She wished she had a cool French accent like Monique's. Everything sounded so much cooler with an accent. Dan came out of the bathroom with his hip hop clothes all wadded up under his arm. No wtaht he was de-puked and sobered up a little, he was tempted to chuck the clothes out the window. "Hey man, you never told us your sister was a bloody fashion model," Damian said. "If bloody Monique is impressed, she must be pretty fucking huge," Lloyd agreed. Boys. Give them some strong Irish ale and all of a sudden they have British accents. Dan was so ashamed of his performance that night be barely looked at his bandmates. "She's done some modeling," he mumbled. Marc, the Raves' bassist opened the door of the suite, back from a walk with his Bernese mountain dog, Trish. Trish was huge and black with a sweet brown-and-white face like a St. Bernard. He'd names the dog after his ex-girlfriend- the love of his life, who'd broken up with him back in the ninth grade- and he never went anywhere without her. How sweet. And how creepy. Dan sat on the floor next to his sister. Trish lay down next to him and put her head in his lap. She had terrible breath like she'd been eating canned mackerel and spoiled milk. "Hey Marc. Turns out Jenny is, like, this hugely famous supermodel," Lloyd announced. Marc glanced shyly at Jenny, then picked up one of the Plaza Hotel bathrobes from the stack and put it on over his clothes. He looked like a modern-day vampire, with curly black hair, pale skin, and nearly black eyes. Jenny giggled, reveling in all the attention. It was one o'clock in the morning and she was at the Plaza Hotel, wearing only a bathrobe and underwear, wit the members of the coolest band ever! It was kind of weird being there with her brother, but kind of reassuring, too. Monique sat up on her knees and stroked Trish's ears. Then she slipped her hand down the back of Dan's bathrobe. "Come into zee bedroom," she mouthed against his ear. Jenny could hear every word Monique said- not that she really wanted to. Boldly, she stood up and went over to the sofa to sit next to Lloyd. After all, she was a famous model- she could sit wherever she liked. Lloyd handed her a breadstick. "In southern Italy these are considered an aphrodisiac." "Liar!" Damian threw a ripe, juicy peach at Lloyd's head. It missed and splattered all over the pristine white wall behind him. You're not a real rock star unless you know how to trash a hotel room. "Don't listen to that butthead, he's full of it," Damian warned suddenly loosing his Irish accent. He dragged three PlayStation joysticks over to the sofa and sat down, so that Jenny was wedged between him and Lloyd. As if she minded. Jenny's feet were tingling and her ears were buzzing. It was a school night and she was a supermodel hanging out in a hotel room with three famous rock stars. If only Serena could see her now. Monique dragged Dan into a standing position. Damian's foot flew up and kicked her in the butt, but Monique pretended not to notice. She pulled Dan into the adjacent bedroom, slamming the door behind them. "Don't make too much noise! Damian shouted after them. Marc lay down where Dan and Monique had been sitting and rested his head on his dog. Trish licked his pale cheek and wrapped an enormous black paw around his neck. Aw. What a cute couple. Jenny had never felt so famous in her life, and she owed it all to her brother. He deserved to hook up with some random French girl. And she deserved to be wedged between the two cutest guys ever to grace the cover of Rolling Stone. If only some reporter would knock on the door and take their picture. She kind of wanted the world to find out about this- it was too good not to be known, even if she got into major trouble. No worries, darling- the world has a funny way of finding out nearly everything. Gossipgirl.net Hey people! AND YOU THOUGHT THE TRIBECA STAR WAS SO COOL The Plaza Hotel is having a revival, a big one. Some of our favorite people were suite-wrecking at the Plaza last night. It happened to late to make it into today's papers, but log onto New York Post's Page Six online, and it's all there. A whole black-and-white photo-montage of adorable little J getting kissed good-bye on the lips by the lead guitarist of the Raves right on the Plaza's red-carpeted steps and getting spanked on her bottom by the drummer with his drumsticks before she swept her into a bear hug. She even wore her Plaza bathrobe home, carelessly leaving her clothes behind, and blew kisses from the taxi, like a modern-day Marilyn Monroe. J wasn't the only budding model to hook up with the Raves' lead guitarist. A hotel staff member actually recorded him singing to S over a Plaza house phone. S finished the call saying, "I love you, Daddy." Oh does she? But what about his marriage to a mysterious French girl a year or so back, in an exclusive ceremony in St. Barts? If you study the photograph of him kissing J, he is wearing a gold band on the ring finger of his left hand... and there was a beautiful French girl on scene as well, although she was totally preoccupied with D, the band's raging new front man. His debut public performance was kind of embarrassing, but, like a typical French girl, she's probably too horny to care. The confusing part is that S was staying with B in her suite, bringing to mind those old stories about S and B in a hot tub together, engaging in what is best described as a little girl-on-girl. As if things weren't complicated enough already! THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THOSE FRENCH GIRLS I know I've ranted about this before, but why is it that the girls who go to L'école Fran?aise look twenty-five when they're only fourteen? And how come all the guys we know secretly or not so secretly lust after them? And how positively infuriating to hear a group of L'école girls talking about you at a party- in Franglish, so that you can hardly understand a word they're saying. They eat only hot chocolate and pommes frites, they chain smoke, and you never see them jogging or playing field hockey in Central Park. Yet none of them are fat or zit-ridden. It's as though their mères and grandmères introduced them to Lanc?me and Chanel when they were only babes, and the alpha hydroxyl acids or whatever permeated their systems, leaving them with perfect skin, perfect bodies, and feet that are most comfortable in three-inch heels. Their school even allows heels- unlike all other girls' schools on the Upper East Side- which basically proves my point. When it comes to educating girls, the French seem to follow a completely different curriculum. Not that we're jealous or anything. OTHER SIGHTINGS B's mom at the Italian Consulate waving her checkbook around-What exactly is she up to now? K and I getting matching bikini waxes at Maria Bonita, a tiny NoLita salon, conveniently located near Sigerson Morrison, which happened to be having a sale. C (who dropped off the radar for a while there after getting rejected at every college he applied to) taking his white monkey to be er...fixed... at a discreet Chelsea clinic. It seems the monkey has inherited its owner's penchant for flirtation and has been throwing itself at every dog, cat, and ferret in the neighborhood. Your e-mail: Q: Dear GG, I know it was you who made the film everyone's so excited about at Cannes. What are you waiting for? Get you ass over here and collect your reward! - mogl A: Dear mogl, You might think the lady doth protest too much, but I'm saying this for the last time: I have no f-ing clue what you're talking about! Enjoy Cannes. -GG Q: Dear GG, What are you supposed to do the rest of the year now that we know where we're going to college? -bord A: Dear bord, Please- isn't this what we've all been waiting for? Time to shop, drink, eat, and be merry? Time to be all we can be? If you don't have your own pool and can't get into the SoHo House rooftop pool, make it your mission to befriend someone with pool access and spend the rest of the day rotating Eres bikinis! -GG Q: Dear GG, If you really really like a girl but she keeps ignoring you, what should you do? -2bummed A: Dear 2bummed, First change your screen name to something more upbeat and attractive like "superhot". Second, make sure your deodorant works and that your outfit isn't completely hopeless. Then ask her to hang out, preferably where there are other people she knows and feels comfortable with, so she can gave fun even if she decides you're a self-effacing loser and she's not interested. Good luck! -GG It's Monday, the start of the school week- I know: Yawn. Realistically, though after a weekend like this, how boring can things be? Like wolves in sheep's clothing, we all look so innocent in our school uniforms, but this weekend won't go without repercussions. I'll be the first to report when the shit hits! You know you love me, Gossip Girl
