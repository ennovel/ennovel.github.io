The origins people were sent home immediately and a serious dermo was called in for damage control. Curiously, our bathing beauty B had a nary mark on her face. The dermo explained that she was probably immune but could be a carrier. Curiouser still, the rash looked exactly like the rash on a certain baby that B had exposed herself to, despite her family's efforts to keep the baby quarantined. Well, at least everyone had a good excuse for missing school on Friday! And with ninety-nine percent of the senior class in quarantine, Constance Billard had no choice but to give the seniors the entire week off. B took the opportunity to fly to Paris to see her dad and bumped into her mother in Chanel on the Left Bank. Apparently her mom was trying to buy the whole company as a gift to B for finally getting into Yale. As the company was not for sale, B settled for four skirts, six pairs of sling-backs, and three evening clutches- how sensible of her! V would have gone with her, but he was in quarantine, poor thing! Not that she didn't have fun playing doctor with her new bf. And what about S and N? He was seen on his way to her Fifth Avenue penthouse on the pretense of borrowing her rash-soothing skin cream, but methinks he might have enjoyed a little game of doctor too. WHAT EVERYONE CAN LOKO FORWARD TO AS SOON AS THEIR SKIN CLEARS UP Insane rooftop graduation parties. Shopping for white graduation dresses that pass the no-cleavage rule but don't make us look like fat bridesmaids. Shopping for escorts to graduation parties who won't get too drunk and throw up all over our gorgeous new dresses. Shopping for the perfect pair of white heels to wear with our graduation dresses, not too high, though- we have to march into graduation in size order, and no one wants to be last. Making a wish of graduation gifts. Can you spel C-A-R, anyone? Getting everything on your wishlist. Vroom, vroom, vroom! Graduation!! SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS 
<br> 
<br> Are S and N a couple? If not, what exactly are they? 
<br> Will B ever speak to them again? Will she get revenge? 
<br> Will B and V continue to cohabitate now that A is always hanging around? 
<br> Will D continueto be a normal kid-sort of? Will he meet a normal girl? 
<br> Will J get into boarding school? Will she stay out of trouble until she gets there? 
<br> Will we all actually graduate?! 
<br> Guess who will have the answers? 
<br>
