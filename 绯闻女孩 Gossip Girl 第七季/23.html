Aqua was the first ingredient. Didn't that mean water? She wondered. Why didn't they just say so? She put the bottle down again. "That's okay. Blair's stepbrother is here. And Dan Humphrey. I didn't think the no-boys policy would work." Nate's eyes hadn't left her face. Tiny beads of water studded her blond-tipped eyelashes. God, she was pretty. He'd come here looking for Blair, but Serena was right there in front of him, wearing only a towel. "I've decided to go to Yale next year," Serena blurted out, brushing the damp tendrils of blond hair away from her face. "I haven't told Blair yet because I don't want her to be mad in case she doesn't get in. But that's where I've decided to go." Nate nodded. It was funny how Serena's face and even her voice were sort of delicate but her body wasn't delicate at all. It was long and sinewy and strong, like a marathon runner's. "I'm going there too," he told her giddily, his voice cracking. "I already sent them my deposit." Serena grinned. "We're both going to Yale!" Nate leaned forward and clasped the top of her bare, damp arms in his hands. He pressed his nose into her long, fair hair. She smelled sweet and warm, like summer. "Mmm," he murmured, and kissed her soft, warm neck, tasting the signature patchouli-scented essential oil mixture she always wore. Hello? Wrong-girl alert! Serena grinned as his lips, traveled up her neck to her lips. "What are you doing?" she murmured without pushing him away. It had been awhile since she'd been kissed, and it felt nice. Of course it was kind of wrong, but it wasn't like she and Nate hadn't kissed before,a dn somehow knowing that they ere going to be together next year made it sem okay. She closed her eyes and gave herself up to the kiss. Her towel fell away, and somehow Nate's damp gray t-shirt seem to fall away too. It was the end of the year, graduation was fast approaching- there was nothing wrong with a little celebratory hookup between two best friends. Yeah, but what about their other best friend?
