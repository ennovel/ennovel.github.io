The gift he had received from Mr. Afton enabled him to carry out a plan he had long desired to realize. It was to secure a sewing machine for his mother, and thus increase her earnings while diminishing her labors. He stopped at an establishment not far from Clark Street, and entering the showroom, asked: "What is the price of your sewing machines?"</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "One in a plain case will cost you twenty-five dollars."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Please show me one."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you want it for your wife?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "She may use it some time. My mother will use it first."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The salesman pointed out an instrument with which Luke was well pleased.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Would you like to see how it works?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, please."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Miss Morris, please show this young man how to operate the machine."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In the course of ten minutes Luke got a fair idea of the method of operating.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you require the whole amount down?" asked Luke.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No; we sell on installments, if preferred."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What are your terms?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Five dollars first payment, and then a dollar a week, with interest on the balance till paid."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then I think I will engage one," Luke decided.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Very well! Come up to the desk, and give me your name and address. On payment of five dollars, we will give you a receipt on account, specifying the terms of paying the balance, etc."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Luke transacted his business, and made arrangements to have the machine delivered any time after six o'clock, when he knew he would be at home.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As Luke was coming out of the sewing-machine office he saw Tom Brooks just passing. Tom looked a little uneasy, not feeling certain whether Luke had recognized him as one of his assailants or not the evening previous.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Luke felt that he had a right to be angry. Indeed, he had it in his power to have Tom arrested, and charged with a very serious crime--that of highway robbery. But his good luck made him good-natured.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Good-evening, Tom," he said. "I didn't see you selling papers to-day."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No; I was on Dearborn Street."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He doesn't know it was me," thought Tom, congratulating himself, and added: "Have you been buying a sewing machine?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 This was said in a joke.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes," answered Luke, considerably to Tom's surprise. "I have bought one."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How much?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Twenty-five dollars."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Where did you raise twenty-five dollars? You're foolin'."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I bought it on the installment plan--five dollars down."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oho!" said Tom, nodding significantly. "I know where you got that money?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Where did I?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "From the gentleman that bought a couple of papers yesterday."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You hit it right the first time."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I thought you weren't no better than the rest of us--you that pretended to be so extra honest."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What do you mean by that, Tom Brooks?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You pretended that you were going to give back the man's change, and spent it, after all. I thought you weren't such a saint as you pretended to be."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I see you keep on judging me by yourself, Tom Brooks. I took round the money this morning, and he gave it to me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Is that true?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes; I generally tell the truth."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then you're lucky. If I'd returned it, he wouldn't have given me a cent."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It's best to be honest on all occasions," said Luke, looking significantly at Tom, who colored up, for he now saw that he had been recognized the night before.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tom sneaked off on some pretext, and Luke kept on his way home.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Did you do well to-day, Luke?" asked Bennie.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, Bennie; very well."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How much did you make?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I'll tell you by and by. Mother, can I help you about the supper?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You may toast the bread, Luke. I am going to have your favorite dish--milk toast."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "All right, mother. Have you been sewing to-day?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, Luke. I sat so long in one position that I got cramped."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I wish you had a sewing machine."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "So do I, Luke; but I must be patient. A sewing machine costs more money than we can afford."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "One can be got for twenty-five dollars, I have heard."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That is a good deal of money for people in our position."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We may as well hope for one. I shouldn't be surprised if we were able to buy a sewing machine very soon."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Meanwhile Luke finished toasting the bread and his mother was dipping it in milk when a step was heard on the stairway, the door was opened, and Nancy's red head was thrust into the room.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Please, Mrs. Walton," said Nancy, breathlessly, "there's a man downstairs with a sewing machine which he says is for you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "There must be some mistake, Nancy. I haven't ordered any sewing machine."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Shall I send him off, ma'am?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, Nancy," said Luke; "it's all right. I'll go down stairs and help him bring it up."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How is this, Luke?" asked Mrs. Walton, bewildered.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I'll explain afterwards, mother."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Up the stairs and into the room came the sewing machine, and was set down near the window. Bennie surveyed it with wonder and admiration.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When the man who brought it was gone, Luke explained to his mother how it had all come about.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You see, mother, you didn't have to wait long," he concluded.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I feel deeply thankful, Luke," said Mrs. Walton. "I can do three times the work I have been accustomed to do, and in much less time. This Mr. Afton must be a kind and charitable man."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I like him better than his clerks," said Luke. "There is a red-headed bookkeeper and a boy there who tried to snub me, and keep me out of the office. I try to think well of red-headed people on account of Nancy, but I can't say I admire them."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 After supper Luke gave his mother a lesson in operating the machine. Both found that it required a little practice.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The next morning as Luke was standing at his usual corner, he had a surprise.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A gentleman came out of the Sherman House and walked slowly up Clark Street. As he passed Luke, he stopped and asked, "Boy, have you the _Inter-Ocean?_"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Luke looked up in his customer's face. He paused in the greatest excitement.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The man was on the shady side of fifty, nearly six feet in height, with a dark complexion, hair tinged with gray, and a wart on the upper part of his right cheek!
