<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He has evidently heard of me," he soliloquized. "His father could not have been so near death as I supposed. He must have sent the boy or his mother a message about that money. If it should come to his knowledge that I am the Thomas Butler to whom his father confided ten thousand dollars which I have failed to hand over to the family, he may make it very disagreeable for me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The fact that so many persons were able to identify him as Thomas Butler made the danger more imminent.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I must take some steps--but what?" Browning asked himself.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He kept on walking till he found himself passing the entrance of a low poolroom. He never played pool, nor would it have suited a man of his social position to enter such a place, but that he caught sight of a young man, whose face and figure were familiar to him, in the act of going into it. He quickened his pace, and laid a hand on the young man's shoulder.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The latter turned quickly, revealing a face bearing the unmistakable marks of dissipation.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Uncle Thomas!" he exclaimed, apparently ill at ease.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, Stephen, it is I. Where are you going?" The young man hesitated.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You need not answer. I see you are wedded to your old amusements. Are you still in the place I got for you?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Stephen Webb looked uneasy and shamefaced.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have lost my place," he answered, after a pause.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How does it happen that you lost it?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I don't know. Some one must have prejudiced my employer against me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is your own habits that have prejudiced him, I make no doubt."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 This was true. One morning Stephen, whose besetting sin was intemperance, appeared at the office where he was employed in such a state of intoxication that he was summarily discharged. It may be explained that he was a son of Mr. Browning's only sister.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "When were you discharged?" asked his uncle.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Last week."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And have you tried to get another situation?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What are your prospects of success?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "There seem to be very few openings just now, Uncle Thomas."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The greater reason why you should have kept the place I obtained for you. Were you going to play pool in this low place?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I was going to look on. A man must have some amusement," said Stephen, sullenly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Amusement is all you think of. However, it so happens that I have something that I wish you to do."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Stephen regarded his uncle in surprise.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Are you going to open an office in Chicago?" he asked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No; the service is of a different nature. It is--secret and confidential. It is, I may say, something in the detective line."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then I'm your man," said his nephew, brightening up.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The service is simple, so that you will probably be qualified to do what I require."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I've read lots of detective stories," said Stephen, eagerly. "It's just the work I should like."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Humph! I don't think much is to be learned from detective stories. You will understand, of course, that you are not to let anyone know you are acting for me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Certainly. You will find that I can keep a secret."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I leave Chicago to-morrow morning, and will give you directions before I go. Where can we have a private conference?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Here is an oyster house. We shall be quiet here."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Very well! We will go in."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They entered a small room, with a sanded floor, provided with a few unpainted tables.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Stephen and his uncle went to the back of the room, and seated themselves at the rear table.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We must order something," suggested Stephen.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Get what you please," said Browning, indifferently.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Two stews!" ordered Stephen. "We can talk while they are getting them ready."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Very well! Now, for my instructions. At the corner of Clark and Randolph Streets every morning and evening you will find a newsboy selling papers."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "A dozen, you mean."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "True, but I am going to describe this boy so that you may know him. He is about fifteen, I should judge, neatly dressed, and would be considered good-looking."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you know his name?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, it is Luke Walton."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Is he the one I am to watch?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You are to make his acquaintance, and find out all you can about his circumstances."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you know where he lives?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No; that is one of the things you are to find out for me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What else do you want me to find out?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Find out how many there are in family, also how they live; whether they have anything to live on except what this newsboy earns."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "All right, Uncle Thomas. You seem to have a great deal of interest in this boy."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That is my business," said Browning, curtly. "If you wish to work for me, you must not show too much curiosity. Never mind what my motives are. Do you understand?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Certainly, Uncle Thomas. It shall be as you say. I suppose I am to be paid?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes. How much salary did you receive where you were last employed?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Ten dollars a week."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You shall receive this sum for the present. It is very good pay for the small service required of you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "All right, uncle."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The stews were ready by this time. They were brought and set before Stephen and his uncle. The latter toyed with his spoon, only taking a taste or two, but Stephen showed much more appreciation of the dish, not being accustomed, like his uncle, to dining at first-class hotels.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How am I to let you know what I find out?" asked Stephen.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Write me at Milwaukee. I will send you further instructions from there."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Very well, sir."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, by the way, you are never to mention me to this Luke Walton. I have my reasons."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I will do just as you say."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How is your mother, Stephen?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "About the same. She isn't a very cheerful party, you know. She is always fretting."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Has she any lodgers?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, three, but one is a little irregular with his rent."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Of course, I expect that you will hand your mother half the weekly sum I pay you. She has a right to expect that much help from her son."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Stephen assented, but not with alacrity, and as he had now disposed of the stew, the two rose from their seats and went outside. A few words of final instructions, and they parted.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I wonder why Uncle Thomas takes such an interest in that newsboy," thought Stephen. "I will make it my business to find out."
