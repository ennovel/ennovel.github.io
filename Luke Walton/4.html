On his way he met Tom Brooks, who was lounging in front of a cigar store, smoking a cigarette.</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Good-evening, Tom," said Luke, politely.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Evenin'!" responded Tom, briefly. "Where you goin'?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "To see Jim Norman. He's sick."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What's the matter of him?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He's got a bad cold and is confined to the house?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tom shrugged his shoulders.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I don't go much on Jim Norman," he said, "He ought to be a girl. He never smoked a cigarette in his life."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Didn't he? All the better for him. I don't smoke myself."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You have smoked."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, I used to, but it troubled my mother, and I promised her I wouldn't do it again."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "So you broke off?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I wouldn't be tied to a woman's apron strings."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Wouldn't you try to oblige your mother?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, I wouldn't. What does a woman know about boys? If I was a gal it would be different."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then we don't agree, that is all."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I say, Luke, won't you take me to the theayter?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I can't afford it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That's all bosh! Haven't you got five dollars? I'd feel rich on five dollars."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Perhaps I might if it were mine, but it isn't."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You can use it all the same," said Tom, in an insinuating voice.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, I can be dishonest if I choose, but I don't choose."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What Sunday school do you go to?" asked Tom, with a sneer.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "None at present."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I thought you did by your talk. It makes me sick!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then," said Luke, good-naturedly, "there is no need to listen to it. I am afraid you are not likely to enjoy my company, so I will walk along."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Luke kept on his way, leaving Tom smoking sullenly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That feller's a fool!" he muttered, in a disgusted tone.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What feller?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tom turned, and saw his friend and chum, Pat O'Connor, who had just come up.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What feller? Why, Luke Walton, of course."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What's the matter of him?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He's got five dollars, and he won't pay me into the theayter."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Where did he get such a pile of money?" asked Pat, in surprise.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "A gentleman gave it to him for a paper, tellin' him to bring the change to-morrer."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Is he goin' to do it?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes; that's why I call him a fool."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I wish you and I had his chance," said Pat, enviously. "We'd paint the town red, I guess."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tom nodded. He and Pat were quite agreed on that point.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Where's Luke goin'?" asked Pat.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "To see Jim Norman. Jim's sick with a cold."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What time's he comin' home?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I don't know. Why?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you think he's got the money with him--the five-dollar bill?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What are you up to?" asked Tom, with a quick glance at his companion.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I was thinkin' we might borrer the money," answered Pat, with a grin.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To Tom this was a new suggestion, but it was favorably received. He conferred with Pat in a low tone, and then the two sauntered down the street in the direction of Jim Norman's home.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Meanwhile we will follow Luke.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He kept on till he reached a shabby brick house.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Jim and his mother, with two smaller children, occupied two small rooms on the top floor. Luke had been there before, and did not stop to inquire directions, but ascended the stairs till he came to Jim's room. The door was partly open, and he walked in.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How's Jim, Mrs. Norman?" he asked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Mrs. Norman was wearily washing dishes at the sink.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He's right sick, Luke," she answered, turning round, and recognizing the visitor. "Do you hear him cough?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 From a small inner room came the sound of a hard and rasping cough.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How are you feeling, Jim?" inquired Luke, entering, and taking a chair at the bedside.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I don't feel any better, Luke," answered the sick boy, his face lighting up with pleasure as he recognized his friend. "I'm glad you come."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You've got a hard cough."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes; it hurts my throat when I cough, and I can't get a wink of sleep."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I've brought you a little cough medicine. It was some we had in the house."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Thank you, Luke. You're a good friend to me. Give me some, please."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "If your mother'll give me a spoon, I'll pour some out."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When the medicine was taken, the boys began to talk.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I ought to be at work," said Jim, sighing. "I don't know how we'll get along if I don't get out soon. Mother has some washing to do, but it isn't enough to pay all our expenses. I used to bring in seventy-five cents a day, and that, with what mother could earn, kept us along."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I wish I was rich enough to help you, Jim, but you know how it is. All I can earn I have to carry home. My mother sews for a house on State Street, but sewing doesn't pay as well as washing."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I know you'd help me if you could, Luke. You have helped me by bringing in the medicine, and it does me good to have you call."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But I would like to do more. I'll tell you what I will do. I know a rich gentleman, one of my customers. I! am to call upon him to-morrow. I'll tell him about you, and perhaps he will help you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Any help would be acceptable, Luke, if you don't mind asking him."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I wouldn't like to ask for myself, but I don't mind asking for you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Luke stayed an hour, and left Jim much brighter and more cheerful for his visit.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When he went out into the street it was quite dark, although the moon now and then peeped out from behind the clouds that a brisk breeze sent scurrying across the sky.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Having a slight headache, he thought he would walk it off, so he sauntered slowly in the direction of the business portion of the city.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Walking farther than he intended, he found himself, almost before he was aware, crossing one of the numerous bridges that span the river. He was busy with thoughts of Jim, and how he could help him, and did not notice that two boys were following him stealthily. It was a complete surprise to him therefore when they rushed upon him, and, each seizing an arm, rendered him helpless.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Hand over what money you've got, and be quick about it!" demanded one of the boys.&nbsp;
