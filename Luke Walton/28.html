(She had been absent from the dinner table on account of a headache.)</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Thank you, Harold," she said. "I am feeling a little better."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Have you any errand you would like to have me do for you?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Mrs. Merton was still more surprised, for offers of services were rare with Harold.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Thank you, again," she said, "but Luke was here this morning, and I gave him two or three commissions."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Perhaps you would like me to read to you, Aunt Eliza."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Thank you, but I am a little afraid it wouldn't be a good thing for my head. How are you getting on at school, Harold?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Pretty well."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You don't want to go to college?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No. I think I would rather be a business man."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, you know your own tastes best."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Aunt Eliza," said Harold, after a pause, "I want to ask a favor of you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Speak out, Harold."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Won't you be kind enough to give me ten dollars?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Ten dollars," repeated the old lady, eying Harold closely. "Why do you want ten dollars?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You see, mother keeps me very close. All the fellows have more money to spend than I."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How much does your mother give you as an allowance?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Two dollars a week."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It seems to me that is liberal, considering that you don't have to pay for your board or clothes."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "A boy in my position is expected to spend money."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Who expects it?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Why, everybody."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "By the way, what is your position?" asked the old lady, pointedly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Why," said Harold, uneasily, "I am supposed to be rich, as I live in a nice neighborhood on a fashionable street."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That doesn't make you rich, does it?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No," answered Harold, with hesitation.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You don't feel absolutely obliged to spend more than your allowance, do you?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, you see, the fellows think I am mean if I don't. There's Ben Clark has an allowance of five dollars a week, and he is three months younger than I am."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then I think his parents or guardians are very unwise. How does he spend his liberal allowance?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, he has a good time."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am afraid it isn't the sort of good time I would approve."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Luke has more money than I have, and he is only a newsboy," grumbled Harold.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How do you know?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I notice he always has money."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I doubt whether he spends half a dollar a week on his own amusement. He has a mother and young brother to support."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He says so!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "So you doubt it?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It may be true."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "If you find it isn't true you can let me know."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am sorry that you think so much more of Luke than of me," complained Harold.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How do you know I do?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Mother thinks so as well as I."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Suppose we leave Luke out of consideration. I shall think as much of you as you deserve."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harold rose from his seat.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "As you have no errand for me, Aunt Eliza, I will go," he said.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Mrs. Merton unlocked a drawer in a work table, took out a pocketbook, and extracted therefrom a ten-dollar-bill.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You have asked me a favor, and I will grant it--for once," she said. "Here are ten dollars."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Thank you," said Harold, joyfully.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I won't even ask how you propose to spend it. I thought of doing so, but it would imply distrust, and for this occasion I won't show any."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You are very kind, Aunt Eliza."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am glad you think so. You are welcome to the money."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harold left the room in high spirits. He decided not to let his mother know that he had received so large a sum, as she might inquire to what use he intended to put it; and some of his expenditures, he felt pretty sure, would not be approved by her.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He left the house, and going downtown, joined a couple of friends of his own stamp. They adjourned to a billiard saloon, and between billiards, bets upon the game, and drinks, Harold managed to spend three dollars before suppertime.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Three days later the entire sum given him by his aunt was gone.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When Harold made the discovery, he sighed. His dream was over. It had been pleasant as long as it lasted, but it was over too soon.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Now I must go back to my mean allowance," he said to himself, in a discontented tone. "Aunt Eliza might give me ten dollars every week just as well as not. She is positively rolling in wealth, while I have to grub along like a newsboy. Why, that fellow Luke has a great deal more money than I."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A little conversation which he had with his Uncle Warner made his discontent more intense.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Hello, Harold, what makes you look so blue?" he asked one day.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Because I haven't got any money," answered Harold.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Doesn't your mother or Aunt Eliza give you any?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I get a little, but it isn't as much as the other fellows get."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How much?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Two dollars a week."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is more than I had when I was of your age."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That doesn't make it any better."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Aunt Eliza isn't exactly lavish; still, she pays Luke Walton generously."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you know how much he gets a week?" asked Harold, eagerly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Ten dollars."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Ten dollars!" ejaculated Harold. "You don't really mean it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, I do. I saw her pay him that sum yesterday. I asked her if it wasn't liberal. She admitted it, but said he had a mother and brother to support."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It's a shame!" cried Harold, passionately.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Why is it? The money is her own, isn't it?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "She ought not to treat a stranger better than her own nephew."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That means me, I judge," said Warner, smiling. "Well, there isn't anything we can do about it, is there?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, I don't know as there is," replied Harold, slowly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But he thought over what his uncle had told him, and it made him very bitter. He brooded over it till it seemed to him as if it were a great outrage. He felt that he was treated with the greatest injustice. He was incensed with his aunt, but still more so with Luke Walton, whom he looked upon as an artful adventurer.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 It was while he was cherishing these feelings that a great temptation came to him. He found, one day in the street, a bunch of keys of various sizes attached to a small steel ring. He picked it up, and quick as a flash there came to him the thought of the drawer in his aunt's work table, from which he had seen her take out the morocco pocketbook. He had observed that the ten-dollar bill she gave him was only one out of a large roll, and his cupidity was aroused. He rapidly concocted a scheme by which he would be enabled to provide himself with money, and throw suspicion upon Luke.&nbsp;
