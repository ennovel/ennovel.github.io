<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes," answered Luke. "I don't think your nephew likes me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Probably not. Both he and his mother are afraid someone will come between me and them. They are selfish, and cannot understand how I can have any other friends or beneficiaries. You are surprised that I speak so openly of such near relatives to such a comparative stranger. However, it is my nature to be outspoken. And now, Luke, if you don't think it will be tiresome to escort an old woman, I mean to take you downtown with me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I look upon you as a kind friend, Mrs. Merton," responded Luke, earnestly. "I want to thank you for the handsome present you made me yesterday. I didn't expect anything like ten dollars."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You will find it acceptable, however, I don't doubt. Seriously, Luke, I don't think it's too much to pay for saving my life. Now, if you will wait here five minutes, I will be ready to go out with you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Five minutes later Mrs. Merton came into the room attired for the street. They went downstairs together, and Luke and she got on a street car.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They were observed by Mrs. Tracy and Harold as they left the house.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Aunt Eliza's very easily imposed upon," remarked the latter.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "She scarcely knows anything of that boy, and she has taken him out with her. How does she know but he is a thief?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He looks like one," said Harold, in an amiable tone. "If aunt is robbed, I shan't pity her. She will deserve it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Very true; but you must remember that it will be our loss as well as hers. Her property will rightfully come to us, and if she is robbed we shall inherit so much the less."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have been thinking, Harold, it may be well for you to find out something of this boy. If you can prove to Aunt Eliza that he is of bad character, she will send him adrift."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I'll see about it, mother."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Meanwhile Mrs. Merton and Luke were on their way to the business portion of the city.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I think I will stop at Adams Street, Luke," said the old lady. "I shall have to go to the Continental Bank. Do you know where it is?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I believe it is on La Salle Street, corner of Adams."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Quite right. I shall introduce you to the paying teller as in my employ, as I may have occasion to send you there alone at times to deposit or draw money."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I wish Harold was more like you," she said. "His mother's suggestion that I should take him with me as an escort would be just as disagreeable to him as to me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Is he attending school?" asked Luke.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes. He is preparing for college, but he is not fond of study, and I doubt whether he ever enters. I think he must be about your age."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am nearly sixteen."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then he is probably a little older."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They entered the bank, and Mrs. Merton, going to the window of the paying teller, presented a check for a hundred dollars.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How will you have it, Mrs. Merton?" asked the teller.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "In fives and tens. By the way, Mr. Northrop, please take notice of this boy with me. I shall occasionally send him by himself to attend to my business. His name is Luke Walton."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "His face looks familiar. I think we have met before."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have sold you papers more than once, Mr. Northrop," said Luke. "I stand on Clark Street, near the Sherman."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, I remember, now. We bank officials are apt to take notice of faces."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Here, Luke, carry this money for me," said Mrs. Merton, putting a lady's pocketbook into the hand of her young escort. "You are less likely to be robbed than I."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Luke was rather pleased at the full confidence his new employer seemed to repose in him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am now going up on State Street," said Mrs. Merton, as they emerged into the street. "You know the store of Marshall Field?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, yes; everybody in Chicago knows that," said Luke.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In a few minutes they stood before the large store, and Mrs. Merton entered, followed by Luke.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Mrs. Merton went to that part of the establishment where woolens are sold, and purchased a dress pattern. To Luke's surprise, the salesman was the same one who had come to his assistance in the car the day previous when he was charged with stealing. The recognition was mutual.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I believe we have met before," said the young man, with a smile.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, fortunately for me," answered Luke, gratefully.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The two parties who were determined to find you guilty looked foolish when they ascertained the real character of your accuser."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What is this, Luke? You didn't tell me of it," said Mrs. Merton.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The story was related briefly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I should like to meet that woman," said Mrs. Merton, nodding energetically. "I'd give her a piece of my mind. Luke, you may hand me ten dollars."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The goods were wrapped up and the change returned.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Where shall I send the bundle, Mrs. Merton?" asked the salesman, deferentially.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Luke will take it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As they left the store Mrs. Merton said: "Did you think I was buying this dress for myself, Luke?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I thought so," Luke answered.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, I have dresses enough to last me a lifetime, I may almost say. This dress pattern is for your mother."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "For my mother?" repeated Luke, joyfully.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes; I hope it will be welcome."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Indeed it will. Mother hasn't had a new dress for over a year."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then I guessed right. Give it to her with my compliments, and tell her I give it to her for your sake. Now, I believe I will go home."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 No present made to Luke could have given him so much pleasure as this gift to his mother, for he knew how much she stood in need of it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When they reached the house on Prairie Avenue, they met Mrs. Tracy on the steps. She had been out for a short call.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Did you have a pleasant morning, Aunt Eliza?" she asked, quite ignoring Luke.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, quite so. Luke, I won't trouble you to come in. I shall not need you to-morrow. The next day you may call at the same hour."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Luke turned away, but was called back sharply by Mrs. Tracy.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Boy!" she said, "you are taking away my aunt's bundle. Bring it back directly."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Louisa," said the old lady, "don't trouble yourself. That bundle is meant for Luke's mother."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Something you bought for her?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, a dress pattern."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh!" sniffed Mrs. Tracy, eying Luke with strong disapproval.&nbsp;
