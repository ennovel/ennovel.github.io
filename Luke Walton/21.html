<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You refer to the wart on the upper part of his right cheek?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, it gives him a repulsive look."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And yet he is popular in Milwaukee?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, among those who were not swindled by his mining scheme. He has done more harm than he can ever repair. For instance," added the young man, bitterly, "this crime which I have committed--I will call it by its right name--I was impelled to do by my mother's poverty, brought on by him."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How does it happen that you are not at the office to day?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I felt sick--sick at heart, rather than sick in body, and I sent word to my employer that I could not be there. I dread entering the office, for at any time exposure may come."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "If you could only raise the fifty dollars, you could replace the money before it was inquired for."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Ambrose Kean shook his head.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I can't possibly raise it," he said, despondently.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I would let you have it if I possessed as much money, but, as you may suppose, I am poor."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am no less grateful to you, Luke. You have a good heart, I am sure. You don't despise me?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, why should I?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have been guilty of a crime."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But you are sorry for it. Is there positively no one with whom you are acquainted who is rich enough to help you?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "There is one lady in Chicago--a rich lady--who was a schoolmate of my mother. She was older and in better circumstances, but they were good friends."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Who is this lady?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "A Mrs. Merton."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Mrs. Merton!" exclaimed Luke, in excitement. "Of Prairie Avenue?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes; I believe she lives there."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Why, I know her--I am in her employ," said Luke.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Ambrose Kean stared at Luke in open amazement.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Is this true?" he asked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Is she a kind lady? Do you think she would help me in this trouble of mine?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "She is very kind-hearted, as I know from my own experience. I will go to her at once, and see what I can do."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Ambrose Kean grasped Luke's hand with fervor.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You are a friend sent from heaven, I truly believe," he said. "You have given me hope of retrieving myself."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I will leave you for a time," said Luke. "There is no time to be lost."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I shall be full of anxiety till I see you again."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Be hopeful. I think I shall bring you good news."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When Luke reached the house on Prairie Avenue he was about to ring the bell when Harold Tracy opened the door.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You here again!" he said, in a tone of displeasure. "Weren't you here this morning?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Did Aunt Eliza ask you to come this afternoon?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then what brings you?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Business," answered Luke, curtly, and he quietly entered the hall, and said to a servant who was passing through, "Will you be kind enough to ask Mrs. Merton if she will see me?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, you're cheeky!" ejaculated Harold, who had in tended to keep him out.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "As long as Mrs. Merton doesn't think so, I shall not trouble myself," said Luke, coldly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Sooner or later Aunt Eliza will see you in your true colors," said Harold, provoked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I think she does now."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 At this moment the servant returned.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You are to go upstairs," she said. "Mrs. Merton will see you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The old lady was sitting back in an easy-chair when Luke entered. She smiled pleasantly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "This is an unexpected pleasure," she said, "this after-noon call."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I will tell you at once what brought me, Mrs. Merton."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It isn't sickness at home, I hope?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, I came for a comparative stranger."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Then Luke told the story of Ambrose Kean, his sudden yielding to temptation, his repentance and remorse.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am interested in your friend," said Mrs. Merton. "You say he appropriated fifty dollars?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, but it was to help his mother."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "True, but it was a dangerous step to take. It won't be considered a valid excuse."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He realizes all that. His employer is a just but strict man, and if the theft is discovered Kean will be arrested, and, of course, convicted."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And you think I will help him? Is that why you have come to me with this story?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I don't think I would have done so if he had not mentioned you as an old friend and schoolmate of his mother."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What's that?" added Mrs. Merton, quickly. "His mother an old schoolmate of mine?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That is what he says."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What was her name before marriage?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Mary Robinson."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You don't say so!" Mrs. Merton exclaimed with vivacity. "Why, Mary was my favorite at school. And this young man is her son?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I would have helped him without knowing this, but now I won't hesitate a moment. Mary's boy! You must bring him here. I want to question him about her."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I can tell you something about her. She lost her money by investing in a California mine--I think it was the Excelsior Mine."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "She, too?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Luke looked surprised. He did not understand the meaning of this exclamation.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have a thousand shares of that worthless stock myself," continued the old lady. "It cost me two thousand dollars, and now it is worth nothing."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The one who introduced the stock was a Mr. Browning, of Milwaukee."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I know. He was an unscrupulous knave, I have no doubt. I could afford the loss, but hundreds invested, like poor Mary, who were ruined. Is the man living, do you know?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, he is living in Milwaukee. He is rich, and is prominently spoken of as a candidate for mayor."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "If he is ever a candidate I will take care that his connection with this swindling transaction is made known. A man who builds up a fortune on the losses of the poor is a contemptible wretch, in my opinion."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And mine, too," said Luke. "It is very strange that he answers the description of a man who cheated our family out of ten thousand dollars."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Indeed! How was that?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Luke told the story, and Mrs. Merton listened with great interest.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "So all corresponds except the name?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He may have changed his name."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have thought of that. I mean to find out some time."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I won't keep you any longer. Your friend is, no doubt, in great anxiety. I have the money here in bills. I will give them to you for him."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Mrs. Merton was in the act of handing a roll of bills to Luke when the door opened suddenly, and Mrs. Tracy entered.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She frowned in surprise and displeasure when she saw her aunt giving money to "that boy," as she contemptuously called him.&nbsp;
