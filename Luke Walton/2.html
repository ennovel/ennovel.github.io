She was the landlady's daughter, and, though of rather fitful and uncertain temper, always had a smile and pleasant word for Luke, who was a favorite of hers.</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, Nancy, how's mother?" asked the newsboy, as he began to ascend the front stairs.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "She seems rather upset like, Luke," answered Nancy.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What has happened to upset her?" asked Luke, anxiously.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I think it's a letter she got about noon. It was a queer letter, all marked up, as if it had been travelin' round. I took it in myself, and carried it up to your ma. I stayed to see her open it, for I was kind of curious to know who writ it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "As soon as your ma opened it, she turned as pale as ashes, and I thought she'd faint away. She put her hand on her heart just so," and Nancy placed a rather dirty hand of her own, on which glittered a five-cent brass ring, over that portion of her anatomy where she supposed her heart lay.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "She didn't faint away, did she?" asked Luke.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, not quite."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Did she say who the letter was from?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No; I asked her, but she said, 'From no one that you ever saw, Nancy.' I say, Luke, if you find out who's it from, let me know."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I won't promise, Nancy. Perhaps mother would prefer to keep it a secret."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, well, keep your secrets, if you want to."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Don't be angry, Nancy; I will tell you if I can," and Luke hurried upstairs to the third story, which contained the three rooms occupied by his mother, his little brother, and himself.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Opening the door, he saw his mother sitting in a rocking-chair, apparently in deep thought, for the work had fallen from her hands and lay in her lap. There was an expression of sadness in her face, as if she had been thinking of the happy past, when the little family was prosperous, and undisturbed by poverty or privation.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What's the matter, mother?" asked Luke, with solicitude.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Mrs. Walton looked up quickly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have been longing to have you come back, Luke," she said. "Something strange has happened to-day."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You received a letter, did you not?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Who told you, Luke?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Nancy. I met her as I came in. She said she brought up the letter, and that you appeared very much agitated when you opened it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is true."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "From whom was the letter, then, mother?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "From your father."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What!" exclaimed Luke, with a start. "Is he not dead?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The letter was written a year ago."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Why, then, has it arrived so late?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Your father on his deathbed intrusted it to someone who mislaid it, and has only just discovered and mailed it. On the envelope he explains this, and expresses his regret. It was at first mailed to our old home, and has been forwarded from there. But that is not all, Luke. I learn from the letter that we have been cruelly wronged. Your father, when he knew he could not live, intrusted to a man in whom he had confidence, ten thousand dollars to be conveyed to us. This wicked man could not resist the temptation, but kept it, thinking we should never know anything about it. You will find it all explained in the letter."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Let me read it, mother," said Luke, in excitement.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Mrs. Walton opened a drawer of the bureau, and placed in her son's hands an envelope, brown and soiled by contact with tobacco. It was directed to her in a shaky hand. Across one end were written these words:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 This letter was mislaid. I have just discovered it, and mail it, hoping it will reach you without further delay. Many apologies and regrets. J. HANSHAW.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Luke did not spend much time upon the envelope, but opened the letter.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The sight of his father's familiar handwriting brought the tears to his eyes, This was the letter:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 GOLD GULCH, California.

 MY DEAR WIFE: It is a solemn thought to me that when you receive this letter these trembling fingers will be cold in death. Yes, dear Mary, I know very well that I am on my deathbed, and shall never more be permitted to see your sweet face, or meet again the gaze of my dear children. Last week I contracted a severe cold while mining, partly through imprudent exposure; and have grown steadily worse, till the doctor, whom I summoned from Sacramento, informs me that there is no hope, and that my life is not likely to extend beyond two days. This is a sad end to my dreams of future happiness with my little family gathered around me. It is all the harder, because I have been successful in the errand that brought me out here. "I have struck it rich," as they say out here, and have been able to lay by ten thousand dollars. I intended to go home next month, carrying this with me. It would have enabled me to start in some business which would have yielded us a liberal living, and provided a comfortable home for you and the children. But all this is over--for me at least. For you I hope the money will bring what I anticipated. I wish I could live long enough to see it in your hands, but that cannot be.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I have intrusted it to a friend who has been connected with me here, Thomas Butler, of Chicago. He has solemnly promised to seek you out, and put the money into your hands. I think he will be true to his trust. Indeed I have no doubt on the subject, for I cannot conceive of any man being base enough to belie the confidence placed in him by a dying man, and despoil a widow and her fatherless children. No, I will not permit myself to doubt the integrity of my friend. If I should, it would make my last sickness exceedingly bitter.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Yet, as something might happen to Butler on his way home, though exceedingly improbable, I think it well to describe him to you. He is a man of nearly fifty, I should say, about five feet ten inches in height, with a dark complexion, and dark hair a little tinged with gray. He will weigh about one hundred and sixty pounds. But there is one striking mark about him which will serve to identify him. He has a wart on the upper part of his right cheek--a mark which disfigures him and mortifies him exceedingly. He has consulted a physician about its removal, but has been told that the operation would involve danger, and, moreover, would not be effectual, as the wart is believed to be of a cancerous nature, and would in all probability grow out again. For these reasons he has given up his intention of having it removed, and made up his mind, unwillingly enough, to carry it to the grave with him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I have given you this long description, not because it seemed at all necessary, for I believe Thomas Butler to be a man of strict honesty, but because for some reason I am impelled to do so.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 I am very tired, and I feel that I must close. God bless you, dear wife, and guard our children, soon to be fatherless!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Your loving husband,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 FREDERICK WALTON.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 P.S.--Butler has left for the East. This letter I have given to another friend to mail after my death.&nbsp;
