I afterwards communicated the same to ourQuarterly Meeting, and they likewise certified their concurrence. Some timeafter, at the General Spring Meeting of ministers and elders, I thought it myduty to acquaint them with the religious exercise which attended my mind; andthey likewise signified their unity therewith by a certificate, dated the 24thof Third Month, 1772, directed to Friends in Great Britain.</p> 
<p>　　In the Fourth Month following, I thought the time was come for me to makesome inquiry for a suitable conveyance; and as my concern was principallytowards the northern parts of England, it seemed most proper to go in a vesselbound to Liverpool or Whitehaven. While I was at Philadelphia deliberating onthis subject I was informed that my beloved friend Samuel Emlen, junior,intended to go to London, and had taken a passage for himself in the cabin ofthe ship called the Mary and Elizabeth, of which James Sparks was master, andJohn Head, of the city of Philadelphia, one of the owners; and feeling adraught in my mind towards the steerage of the same ship, I went first andopened to Samuel the feeling I had concerning it.</p> 
<p>　　My beloved friend wept when I spake to him, and appeared glad that I hadthoughts of going in the vessel with him, though my prospect was toward thesteerage: and he offering to go with me, we went on board, first into the cabin-- a commodious room -- and then into the steerage, where we sat down on achest, the sailors being busy about us. The owner of the ship also came and satdown with us. My mind was turned towards Christ, the heavenly Counsellor, andfeeling at this time my own will subjected, my heart was contrite before Him. Amotion was made by the owner to go and sit in the cabin, as a place moreretired; but I felt easy to leave the ship, and, making no agreement as to apassage in her, told the owner if I took a passage in the ship I believed itwould be in the steerage; but did not say much as to my exercise in that case.</p> 
<p>　　After I went to my lodgings, and the case was a little known in town, aFriend laid before me the great inconvenience attending a passage in thesteerage, which for a time appeared very discouraging to me.</p> 
<p>　　I soon after went to bed, and my mind was under a deep exercise before theLord, whose helping hand was manifested to me as I slept that night, and Hislove strengthened my heart. In the morning I went with two Friends on board thevessel again, and after a short time spent therein, I went with Samuel Emlen tothe house of the owner, to whom, in the hearing of Samuel only, I opened my exercise in relation to a scruple I felt with regard to a passage in the cabin,in substance as follows: -"That on the outside of that part of the ship where the cabin was, I observedsundry sorts of carved work and imagery; that in the cabin I observed somesuperfluity of workmanship of several sorts; and that according to the ways ofmen's reckoning, the sum of money to be paid for a passage in that apartmenthas some relation to the expense of furnishing it to please the minds of suchas give way to a conformity to this world; and that in this, as in other cases,the moneys received from the passengers are calculated to defray the cost ofthese superfluities, as well as the other expenses of their passage. Itherefore felt a scruple with regard to paying my money to be applied to suchpurposes."As my mind was now opened, I told the owner that I had, at several times, inmy travels, seen great oppressions on this continent, at which my heart hadbeen much affected and brought into a feeling of the state of the sufferers;and having many times been engaged in the fear and love of God, to labour withthose under whom the oppressed have been borne down and afflicted, I have oftenperceived that with a view to get riches and to provide estates for children,that they may live conformably to the customs and honours of this world, manyare entangled in the spirit of oppression, and the exercise of my soul has beensuch, that I could not find peace in joining in anything which I saw wasagainst that wisdom which is pure.</p> 
<p>　　After this I agreed for a passage in the steerage; and hearing that JosephWhite had desired to see me, I went to his house, and the next day home, whereI tarried two nights. Early the next morning, I parted with my family under asense of the humbling hand of God upon me, and, going to Philadelphia, had anopportunity with several of my beloved friends, who appeared to be concernedfor me on account of the unpleasant situation of that part of the vessel inwhich I was likely to lodge. In these opportunities my mind, through themercies of the Lord, was kept low in an inward waiting for His help; andFriends having expressed their desire that I might have a more convenient placethan the steerage, did not urge it, but appeared disposed to leave me to theLord.</p> 
<p>　　Having stayed two nights at Philadelphia, I went the next day to DerbyMonthly Meeting, where through the strength of divine love my heart wasenlarged towards the youth there present, under which I was helped to labour insome tenderness of spirit. I lodged at William Horn's and afterwards went toChester, where I met with Samuel Emlen, and we went on board 1st of FifthMonth, 1772. As I sat alone on the deck, I felt a satisfactory evidence that my proceedings were not in my own will, but under the power of the cross ofChrist.</p> 
<p>　　Seventh of Fifth Month. -- We have had rough weather mostly since I came onboard, and the passengers, James Reynolds, John Till Adams, Sarah Logan withher hired maid, and John Bispham, all sea-sick at times; from which sickness,through the tender mercies of my Heavenly Father, I have been preserved, myafflictions now being of another kind. There appeared an openness in the mindsof the master of the ship and in the cabin passengers towards me. We are oftentogether on the deck, and sometimes in the cabin. My mind, through the mercifulhelp of the Lord, hath been preserved in a good degree watchful and quiet, forwhich I have great cause to be thankful.</p> 
<p>　　As my lodging in the steerage, now near a week, hath afforded me sundryopportunities of seeing, hearing, and feeling with respect to the life andspirit of many poor sailors, an exercise of soul hath attended me in regard toplacing our children and youth where they may be likely to be exampled andinstructed in the pure fear of the Lord.</p> 
<p>　　Being much among the seamen I have, from a motion of love, taken sundryopportunities with one of them at a time, and have in free conversationlaboured to turn their minds toward the fear of the Lord. This day we had ameeting in the cabin, where my heart was contrite under a feeling of divinelove.</p> 
<p>　　I believe a communication with different parts of the world by sea is attimes consistent with the will of our Heavenly Father, and to educate someyouth in the practice of sailing, I believe, may be right; but how lamentableis the present corruption of the world! How impure are the channels throughwhich trade is conducted! How great is the danger to which poor lads areexposed when placed on shipboard to learn the art of sailing! Five ladstraining up for the seas were on board this ship. Two of them were brought upin our Society, and the other, by name James Naylor, is a member, to whosefather James Naylor, mentioned in Sewel's history, appears to have been uncle.</p> 
<p>　　I often feel a tenderness of heart towards these poor lads, and at times lookat them as though they were my children according to the flesh.</p> 
<p>　　Oh that all may take heed and beware of covetousness! Oh that all may learnof Christ, who was meek and lowly of heart. Then, in faithfully following Him,He will teach us to be content with food and raiment without respect to thecustoms or honours of this world. Men thus redeemed will feel a tender concernfor their fellow-creatures, and a desire that those in the lowest stations may be assisted and encouraged, and where owners of ships attain to the perfect lawof liberty and are doers of the Word, these will be blessed in their deeds.</p> 
<p>　　A ship at sea commonly sails all night, and the seamen take their watchesfour hours at a time. Rising to work in the night, it is not commonly pleasantin any case, but in dark rainy nights it is very disagreeable, even though eachman were furnished with all conveniences. If, after having been on deck severalhours in the night, they come down into the steerage soaking wet, and are soclosely stowed that proper convenience for change of garments is not easilycome at, but for want of proper room their wet garments are thrown in heaps,and sometimes, through much crowding, are trodden under foot in going to theirlodgings and getting out of them, and it is difficult at times for each to findhis own. Here are trials for the poor sailors.</p> 
<p>　　Now, as I have been with them in my lodge, my heart hath often yearned forthem, and tender desires have been raised in me that all owners and masters ofvessels may dwell in the love of God and therein act uprightly, and by seekingless for gain and looking carefully to their ways they may earnestly labour toremove all cause of provocation from the poor seamen, so that they may neitherfret nor use excess of strong drink; for, indeed, the poor creatures, in thewet and cold, seem to apply at times to strong drink to supply the want ofother convenience. Great reformation is wanting in the world, and the necessityof it among those who do business on great waters hath at this time beenabundantly opened before me.</p> 
<p>　　Eighth of Fifth Month. -- This morning the clouds gathered, the wind blewstrong from the south-east, and before noon so increased that sailing appeareddangerous. The seamen then bound up some of their sails and took down others,and the storm increasing, they put the dead-lights, so called, into the cabinwindows and lighted a lamp as at night. The wind now blew vehemently, and thesea wrought to that degree that an awful seriousness prevailed in the cabin, inwhich I spent, I believe, about seventeen hours, for the cabin passengers hadgiven me frequent invitations, and I thought the poor wet toiling seamen hadneed of all the room in the crowded steerage. They now ceased from sailing andput the vessel in the posture called "lying to."My mind during this tempest, through the gracious assistance of the Lord, waspreserved in a good degree of resignation; and at times I expressed a few wordsin His love to my shipmates in regard to the all-sufficiency of Him who formedthe great deep, and whose care is so extensive that a sparrow falls not withoutHis notice; and thus in a tender frame of mind I spoke to them of the necessityof our yielding in true obedience to the instructions of our Heavenly Father,who sometimes through adversities intendeth our refinement.</p> 
<p>　　About eleven at night I went out on the deck. The sea wrought exceedingly,and the high, foaming waves round about had in some sort the appearance offire, but did not give much if any light. The sailor at the helm said he latelysaw a corposant at the head of the mast. I observed that the master of the shipordered the carpenter to keep on the deck; and, though he said little, Iapprehended his care was that the carpenter with his axe might be in readinessin case of any emergency. Soon after this the vehemency of the wind abated, andbefore morning they again put the ship under sail.</p> 
<p>　　Tenth of Fifth Month. -- It being the first day of the week and fine weather,we had a meeting in the cabin, at which most of the seamen were present; thismeeting was to me a strengthening time. 13th. -- As I continue to lodge in thesteerage I feel an openness this morning to express something further of thestate of my mind in respect to poor lads bound apprentice to learn the art ofsailing. As I believe sailing is of use in the world, a labour of soul attendsme that the pure counsel of truth may be humbly waited for in this case by allconcerned in the business of the seas. A pious father whose mind is exercisedfor the everlasting welfare of his child, may not with a peaceable mind placehim out to an employment among a people whose common course of life ismanifestly corrupt and profane. Great is the present defect among seafaring menin regard to virtue and piety; and, by reason of an abundant traffic, and manyships being used for war, so many people are employed on the sea, that thesubject of placing lads to this employment appears very weighty.</p> 
<p>　　When I remember the saying of the Most High through His prophet, "This peoplehave I formed for myself; they shall show forth My praise," and think ofplacing children among such to learn the practice of sailing, the consistencyof it with a pious education seems to me like that mentioned by the prophet,"There is no answer from God."Profane examples are very corrupting and very forcible. And as my mind dayafter day and night after night hath been affected with a sympathizingtenderness towards poor children who are put to the employment of sailors, Ihave sometimes had weighty conversation with the sailors in the steerage, whowere mostly respectful to me, and became more so the longer I was with them.</p> 
<p>　　They mostly appeared to take kindly what I said to them; but their minds wereso deeply impressed with the almost universal depravity among sailors, that thepoor creatures in their answers to me have revived in my remembrance that ofthe degenerate Jews a little before the captivity, as repeated by Jeremiah theprophet, "There is no hope."Now under this exercise a sense of the desire of outward gain prevailingamong us felt grievous; and a strong call to the professed followers of Christ was raised in me that all may take heed lest, through loving this presentworld, they be found in a continued neglect of duty with respect to a faithfullabour for reformation.</p> 
<p>　　To silence every motion proceeding from the love of money, and humbly to waitupon God to know His will concerning us have appeared necessary. He alone isable to strengthen us to dig deep, to remove all which lies between us and thesafe foundation, and so to direct us in our outward employment that pureuniversal love may shine forth in our proceedings. Desires arising from thespirit of truth are pure desires; and when a mind divinely opened towards ayoung generation is made sensible of corrupting examples powerfully working andextensively spreading among them, how moving is the prospect! In a world ofdangers and difficulties, like a desolate, thorny wilderness, how precious, howcomfortable, how safe, are the leadings of Christ the good Shepherd, who said,"I know my sheep, and am known of mine!"Sixteenth of Fifth Month. -- Wind for several days past often high, what thesailors call squally, with a rough sea and frequent rains. This last night hasbeen a very trying one to the poor seamen, the water the most part of the nightrunning over the main-deck, and sometimes breaking waves came on the quarterdeck. The latter part of the night, as I lay in bed, my mind was humbled underthe power of divine love; and resignedness to the great Creator of the earthand the seas was renewedly wrought in me, and His fatherly care over Hischildren felt precious to my soul. I was now desirous to embrace everyopportunity of being inwardly acquainted with the hardships and difficulties ofmy fellow-creatures, and to labour in His love for the spreading of purerighteousness on the earth. Opportunities were frequent of hearing conversationamong the sailors respecting the voyages to Africa, and the manner of bringingthe deeply oppressed slaves into our islands. They are frequently brought onboard the vessels in chains and fetters, with hearts loaded with grief underthe apprehension of miserable slavery; so that my mind was frequently engagedto meditate on these things.</p> 
<p>　　Seventeenth of Fifth Month and first of the week. -- We had a meeting in thecabin, to which the seamen generally came. My spirit was contrite before theLord, whose love at this time affected my heart. In the afternoon I felt atender sympathy of soul with my poor wife and family left behind, in whichstate my heart was enlarged in desires that they may walk in that humbleobedience wherein the everlasting Father may be their guide and support throughall their difficulties in this world; and a sense of that gracious assistance,through which my mind hath been strengthened to take up the cross and leavethem to travel in the love of truth, hath begotten thankfulness in my heart toour great Helper.</p> 
<p>　　Twenty-fourth of Fifth Month. -- A clear, pleasant morning. As I sat on deckI felt a reviving in my nature, which had been weakened through much rainyweather and high winds and being shut up in a close, unhealthy air. Severalnights of late I have felt my breathing difficult; and a little after therising of the second watch, which is about midnight, I have got up and stoodnear an hour with my face near the hatchway, to get the fresh air at the smallvacancy under the hatch door, which is commonly shut down, partly to keep outrain and sometimes to keep the breaking waves from dashing into the steerage. Imay with thankfulness to the Father of Mercies acknowledge that in my presentweak state, my mind hath been supported to bear this affliction with patience;and I have looked at the present dispensation as a kindness from the greatFather of mankind, who, in this my floating pilgrimage, is in some degreebringing me to feel what many thousands of my fellow-creatures often suffer ina greater degree.</p> 
<p>　　My appetite failing, the trial hath been the heavier; and I have felt tenderbreathings in my soul after God, the Fountain of comfort, whose inward helphath supplied at times the want of outward convenience; and strong desires haveattended me that His family, who are acquainted with the movings of His HolySpirit, may be so redeemed from the love of money and from that spirit in whichmen seek honour one of another, that in all business, by sea or land, they mayconstantly keep in view the coming of His kingdom on earth as it is in Heaven,and, by faithfully following this safe guide, may show forth examples tendingto lead out of that under which the creation groans. This day we had a meetingin the cabin, in which I was favoured in some degree to experience thefulfilling of that saying of the prophet, "The Lord hath been a strength to thepoor, a strength to the needy in their distress"; for which my heart is bowedin thankfulness before Him.</p> 
<p>　　Twenty-eighth of Fifth Month. -- Wet weather of late, and small winds,inclining to calms. Our seamen cast a lead, I suppose about one hundredfathoms, and found no bottom. Foggy weather this morning. Through the kindnessof the great Preserver of men my mind remains quiet; and a degree of exercisefrom day to day attends me, that the pure peaceable government of Christ mayspread and prevail among mankind.</p> 
<p>　　The leading of a young generation in that pure way in which the wisdom ofthis world hath no place, where parents and tutors, humbly waiting for theheavenly Counsellor, may example them in the truth as it is in Jesus, hath forseveral days been the exercise of my mind. Oh, how safe, how quiet, is thatstate where the soul stands in pure obedience to the voice of Christ, and awatchful care is maintained not to follow the voice of the stranger! HereChrist is felt to be our Shepherd, and under His leading people are brought to a stability; and where He doth not lead forward, we are bound in the bonds ofpure love to stand still and wait upon Him.</p> 
<p>　　In the love of money and in the wisdom of this world, business is proposed,then the urgency of affairs pushes forward, and the mind cannot in this statediscern the good and perfect will of God concerning us. The love of God ismanifested in graciously calling us to come out of that which stands inconfusion; but if we bow not in the name of Jesus, if we give not up thoseprospects of gain which in the wisdom of this world are open before us, but sayin our hearts, "I must needs go on; and in going on I hope to keep as near thepurity of truth as the business before me will admit of," the mind remainsentangled and the shining of the light of life into the soul is obstructed.</p> 
<p>　　Surely the Lord calls to mourning and deep humiliation, that in His fear wemay be instructed and led safely through the great difficulties andperplexities in this present age. In an entire subjection of our wills, theLord graciously opens a way for His people, where all their wants are boundedby His wisdom; and here we experience the substance of what Moses the prophetfigured out in the water of separation as a purification from sin.</p> 
<p>　　Esau is mentioned as a child red all over like a hairy garment. In Esau isrepresented the natural will of man. In preparing the water of separation a redheifer without blemish, on which there had been no yoke, was to be slain andher blood sprinkled by the priest seven times towards the tabernacle of thecongregation; then her skin, her flesh, and all pertaining to her, was to beburnt without the camp, and of her ashes the water was prepared. Thus, thecrucifying of the old man, or natural will, is represented; and hence comes aseparation from that carnal mind which is death. "He who toucheth the dead bodyof a man and purifieth not himself with the water of separation, defileth thetabernacle of the Lord; he is unclean" (Num. xix. 13).</p> 
<p>　　If any, who through the love of gain engage in business wherein they dwell asamong the tombs and touch the bodies of those who are dead, should through theinfinite love of God feel the power of the cross of Christ to crucify them tothe world, and therein learn humbly to follow the divine Leader, here is thejudgment of this world, here the prince of this world is cast out. The water ofseparation is felt; and though we have been among the slain, and through thedesire of gain have touched the dead body of a man, yet in the purifying loveof Christ we are washed in the water of separation; we are brought off fromthat business, from that gain, and from that fellowship which is not agreeableto His holy will. I have felt a renewed confirmation in the time of thisvoyage, that the Lord, in His infinite love, is calling to His visited childrenso to give up all outward possessions and means of getting treasures, that His Holy Spirit may have free course in their hearts and direct them in all theirproceedings. To feel the substance pointed at in this figure, man must knowdeath as to his own will.</p> 
<p>　　"No man can see God and live." This was spoken by the Almighty to Moses theprophet and opened by our blessed Redeemer. As death comes on our own wills,and a new life is formed in us, the heart is purified and prepared tounderstand clearly, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." Inpurity of heart the mind is divinely opened to behold the nature of universalrighteousness, or the righteousness of the kingdom of God. "No man hath seenthe Father save he that is of God, he hath seen the Father."The natural mind is active about the things of this life, and in this naturalactivity business is proposed and a will is formed in us to go forward in it.</p> 
<p>　　And so long as this natural will remains unsubjected, so long there remains anobstruction to the clearness of divine light operating in us; but when we loveGod with all our heart and with all our strength, in this love we love ourneighbour as ourselves; and a tenderness of heart is felt towards all peoplefor whom Christ died, even those who, as to outward circumstances, may be to usas the Jews were to the Samaritans. "Who is my neighbour?" See this questionanswered by our Saviour, Luke x. 30. In this love we can say that Jesus is theLord; and in this reformation in our souls, manifested in a full reformation ofour lives, wherein all things are new, and all things are of God (2 Cor. v.</p> 
<p>　　18), the desire of gain is subjected.</p> 
<p>　　When employment is honestly followed in the light of truth, and people becomediligent in business, "fervent in spirit, serving the Lord" (Rom. xii. 11), themeaning of the name is opened to us: "This is the name by which He shall becalled, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS" (Jer. xxiii. 6). Oh, how precious is thename! it is like ointment poured out. The chaste virgins are in love with theRedeemer; and for promoting his peaceable kingdom in the world are content toendure hardness like good soldiers; and are so separated in spirit from thedesire of riches, that in their employments they become extensively careful togive no offence, either to Jew or Heathen or to the Church of Christ.</p> 
<p>　　Thirty-first of Fifth Month and first of the week. -- We had a meeting in thecabin, with nearly all the ship's company, the whole being near thirty. In thismeeting the Lord in mercy favoured us with the extending of His love.</p> 
<p>　　Second of Sixth Month. -- Last evening the seamen found bottom at aboutseventy fathoms. This morning, a fair wind and pleasant. I sat on deck; myheart was overcome with the love of Christ, and melted into contrition beforeHim. In this state the prospect of that work to which I found my mind drawn when in my native land being, in some degree, opened before me, I felt like alittle child; and my cries were put up to my Heavenly Father for preservation,that in an humble dependence on Him my soul might be strengthened in His loveand kept inwardly waiting for His counsel. This afternoon we saw that part ofEngland called the Lizard.</p> 
<p>　　Some fowls yet remained of those the passengers took for their sea-store. Ibelieve about fourteen perished in the storms at sea, by the waves breakingover the quarter-deck, and a considerable number with sickness at differenttimes. I observed the cocks crew as we came down the Delaware, and while wewere near the land, but afterwards I think I did not hear one of them crow tillwe came near the English coast, when they again crowed a few times. Inobserving their dull appearance at sea, and the pining sickness of some ofthem, I often remembered the Fountain of goodness, who gave being to allcreatures, and whose love extends to caring for the sparrows. I believe wherethe love of God is verily perfected, and the true spirit of governmentwatchfully attended to, a tenderness towards all creatures made subject to uswill be experienced, and a care felt in us that we do not lessen that sweetnessof life in the animal creation which the great Creator intends for them underour government.</p> 
<p>　　Fourth of Sixth Month. -- Wet weather, high winds, and so dark that we couldsee but a little way. I perceived our seamen were apprehensive of the danger ofmissing the channel, which I understood was narrow. In a while it grew lighter,and they saw the land and knew where we were. Thus the Father of Mercies waspleased to try us with the sight of dangers, and then graciously, from time totime, deliver us from them; thus sparing our lives, that in humility andreverence we might walk before Him and put our trust in Him. About noon a pilotcame off from Dover, where my beloved friend Samuel Emlen went on shore andthence to London, about seventy-two miles by land; but I felt easy in stayingin the ship.</p> 
<p>　　Seventh of Sixth Month and first of the week. -- A clear morning: we lay atanchor for the tide, and had a parting meeting with the ship's company, inwhich my heart was enlarged in a fervent concern for them, that they may cometo experience salvation through Christ. Had a head-wind up the Thames; laysometimes at anchor; saw many ships passing, and some at anchor near; and I hadlarge opportunity of feeling the spirit in which the poor bewildered sailorstoo generally live. That lamentable degeneracy which so much prevails in thepeople employed on the sea, so affected my heart that I cannot easily conveythe feeling I had to another.</p> 
<p>　　The present state of the seafaring life in general appears so opposite tothat of a pious education, so full of corruption and extreme alienation fromGod, so full of the most dangerous examples to young people, that in lookingtowards a young generation I feel a care for them, that they may have aneducation different from the present one of lads at sea, and that all of us whoare acquainted with the pure gospel spirit may lay this case to heart, mayremember the lamentable corruptions which attend the conveyance of merchandiseacross the seas, and so abide in the love of Christ that, being delivered fromthe entangling expenses of a curious, delicate, and luxurious life, we maylearn contentment with a little, and promote the seafaring life no further thanthat spirit which leads into all truth attends us in our proceedings.</p>
