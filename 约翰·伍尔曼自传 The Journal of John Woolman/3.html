<p>　　In the fall of the year 1750 died my father, Samuel Woolman, of a fever, agedabout sixty years. In his lifetime he manifested much care for us his children,that in our youth we might learn to fear the Lord; and often endeavoured toimprint in our minds the true principles of virtue, and particularly to cherishin us a spirit of tenderness, not only towards poor people, but also towardsall creatures of which we had the command.</p> 
<p>　　After my return from Carolina in 1746, I made some observations on keepingslaves which some time before his decease I showed to him; he perused themanuscript, proposed a few alterations, and appeared well satisfied that Ifound a concern on that account. In his last sickness, as I was watching withhim one night, he being so far spent that there was no expectation of hisrecovery, though he had the perfect use of his understanding, he asked meconcerning the manuscript, and whether I expected soon to proceed to take theadvice of Friends in publishing it? After some further conversation thereon, hesaid, "I have all along been deeply affected with the oppression of the poornegroes; and now, at last, my concern for them is as great as ever."By his direction I had written his will in a time of health, and that nighthe desired me to read it to him, which I did; and he said it was agreeable tohis mind. He then made mention of his end, which he believed was near; andsignified that, though he was sensible of many imperfections in the course ofhis life, yet his experience of the power of truth, and of the love andgoodness of God from time to time, even till now, was such that he had no doubtthat on leaving this life he should enter into one more happy.</p> 
<p>　　The next day his sister Elizabeth came to see him, and told him of thedecease of their sister Anne, who died a few days before; he then said, "Ireckon Sister Anne was free to leave this world?" Elizabeth said she was. Hethen said, "I also am free to leave it"; and being in great weakness of bodysaid, "I hope I shall shortly go to rest." He continued in a weighty frame ofmind, and was sensible till near the last.</p> 
<p>　　Second of Ninth Month, 1751. -- Feeling drawings in my mind to visit Friendsat the Great Meadows, in the upper part of West Jersey, with the unity of ourMonthly Meeting I went there, and had some searching labourious exerciseamongst Friends in those parts, and found inward peace therein.</p> 
<p>　　Ninth Month, 1753. -- In company with my well-esteemed friend, John Sykes,and with the unity of Friends, I travelled about two weeks, visiting Friends inBuck's County. We laboured in the love of the gospel, according to the measure received; and through the mercies of Him who is strength to the poor who trustin Him, we found satisfaction in our visit. In the next winter, way opening tovisit Friends' families within the compass of our Monthly Meeting, partly bythe labours of two Friends from Pennsylvania, I joined in some part of thework, having had a desire some time that it might go forward amongst us.</p> 
<p>　　About this time, a person at some distance lying sick, his brother came to meto write his will. I knew he had slaves, and, asking his brother, was told heintended to leave them as slaves to his children. As writing is a profitableemploy, and as offending sober people was disagreeable to my inclination, I wasstraitened in my mind; but as I looked to the Lord, he inclined my heart to Histestimony. I told the man that I believed the practice of continuing slavery tothis people was not right, and that I had a scruple in my mind against doingwritings of that kind; that though many in our Society kept them as slaves,still I was not easy to be concerned in it, and desired to be excused fromgoing to write the will. I spake to him in the fear of the Lord, and he made noreply to what I said, but went away; he also had some concerns in the practice,and I thought he was displeased with me. In this case I had fresh confirmationthat acting contrary to present outward interest, from a motive of divine loveand in regard to truth and righteousness, and thereby incurring the resentmentsof people, opens the way to a treasure better than silver, and to a friendshipexceeding the friendship of men.</p> 
<p>　　The manuscript before mentioned having laid by me several years, thepublication of it rested weightily upon me, and this year I offered it to therevisal of my friends, who, having examined and made some small alterations init, directed a number of copies thereof to be published and dispersed amongstmembers of our Society.(1) In the year 1754 I found my mind drawn to join in avisit to Friends' families belonging to Chesterfield Monthly Meeting, andhaving the approbation of our own, I went to their Monthly Meeting in order toconfer with Friends, and see if way opened for it. I had conference with someof their members, the proposal having been opened before in their meeting, andone Friend agreed to join with me as a companion for a beginning; but whenmeeting was ended, I felt great distress of mind, and doubted what way to take,or whether to go home and wait for greater clearness. I kept my distresssecret, and, going with a Friend to his house, my desires were to the greatShepherd for His heavenly instruction.</p> 
<p>　　In the morning I felt easy to proceed on the visit, though very low in mymind. As mine eye was turned to the Lord, waiting in families in deep reverencebefore Him, He was pleased graciously to afford help, so that we had manycomfortable opportunities, and it appeared as a fresh visitation to some youngpeople. I spent several weeks this winter in the service, part of which timewas employed near home. And again in the following winter I was several weeksin the same service; some part of the time at Shrewsbury, in company with my beloved friend, John Sykes; and I have cause humbly to acknowledge that throughthe goodness of the Lord our hearts were at times enlarged in His love, andstrength was given to go through the trials which, in the course of our visit,attended us.</p> 
<p>　　From a disagreement between the powers of England and France, it was now atime of trouble on this continent, and an epistle to Friends went forth fromour general Spring Meeting, which I thought good to give a place in thisJournal.</p> 
<p>　　An Epistle from our General Spring Meeting of ministers and elders forPennsylvania and New Jersey, held at Philadelphia, from the 29th of the ThirdMonth to the 1st of the Fourth Month, inclusive, 1755.</p> 
<p>　　TO FRIENDS ON THE CONTINENT OF AMERICA: -DEAR FRIENDS, --In an humble sense of divine goodness, and the graciouscontinuation of God's love to His people, we tenderly salute you, and are atthis time therein engaged in mind, that all of us who profess the truth, asheld forth and published by our worthy predecessors in this latter age of theworld, may keep near to that Life which is the Light of men, and bestrengthened to hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering, thatour trust may not be in man, but in the Lord alone, who ruleth in the army ofheaven and in the kingdoms of men, before whom the earth is "as the dust of thebalance, and her inhabitants as grasshoppers" (Isa. xl. 22).</p> 
<p>　　Being convinced that the gracious design of the Almighty in sending His Soninto the world was to repair the breach made by disobedience, to finish sin andtransgression, that His kingdom might come, and His will be done on earth as itis in heaven, we have found it to be our duty to cease from those nationalcontests which are productive of misery and bloodshed, and submit our cause toHim, the Most High, whose tender love to His children exceeds the most warmaffections of natural parents, and who hath promised to His seed throughout theearth, as to one individual, "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee" (Heb.</p> 
<p>　　xiii. 5). And we, through the gracious dealings of the Lord our God, have hadexperience of that work which is carried on, "not by earthly might, nor bypower, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts" (Zech. iv. 6). By whichoperation that spiritual kingdom is set up, which is to subdue and break inpieces all kingdoms that oppose it, and shall stand forever. In a deep sensethereof, and of the safety, stability, and peace that are in it, we aredesirous that all who profess the truth may be inwardly acquainted with it, andthereby be qualified to conduct ourselves in all parts of our life as becomesour peaceable profession; and we trust, as there is a faithful continuance todepend wholly upon the Almighty arm, from one generation to another, thepeaceable kingdom will gradually be extended "from sea to sea, and from theriver to the ends of the earth" (Zech. ix. 10), to the completion of those prophecies already begun, that "nation shall not lift up a sword againstnation, nor learn war any more" (Isa. ii. 4; Micah iv. 3).</p> 
<p>　　And, dearly beloved friends, seeing that we have these promises, andbelieve that God is beginning to fulfil them, let us constantly endeavour tohave our minds sufficiently disentangled from the surfeiting cares of thislife, and redeemed from the love of the world, that no earthly possessions norenjoyments may bias our judgments, or turn us from that resignation and entiretrust in God to which His blessing is most surely annexed; then may we say,"Our Redeemer is mighty, he will plead our cause for us" (Jer. l. 34). And if,for the further promoting of His most gracious purposes in the earth, He shouldgive us to taste of that bitter cup of which His faithful ones have oftenpartaken, O that we might be rightly prepared to receive it!</p> 
<p>　　And now, dear friends, with respect to the commotions and stirrings of thepowers of the earth at this time near us, we are desirous that none of us maybe moved thereat, but repose ourselves in the munition of that rock which allthese shakings shall not move, even in the knowledge and feeling of the eternalpower of God, keeping us subjectly given up to His heavenly will, and feelingit daily to mortify that which remains in any of us which is of this world; forthe worldly part in any is the changeable part, and that is up and down, fulland empty, joyful and sorrowful, as things go well or ill in this world. For asthe truth is but one, and many are made partakers of its spirit, so the worldis but one, and many are made partakers of the spirit of it; and so many as dopartake of it, so many will be straitened and perplexed with it. But they whoare single to the truth, waiting daily to feel the life and virtue of it intheir hearts, shall rejoice in the midst of adversity, and have to experiencewith the prophet, that, "although the fig-tree shall not blossom, neither shallfruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shallyield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be noherd in the stalls; yet will they rejoice in the Lord, and joy in the God oftheir salvation" (Hab. iii. 17, 18).</p> 
<p>　　If, contrary to this, we profess the truth, and, not living under the powerand influence of it, are producing fruits disagreeable to the purity thereof,and trust to the strength of man to support ourselves, our confidence thereinwill be vain. For He who removed the hedge from His vineyard, and gave it to betrodden under foot by reason of the wild grapes it produced (Isa. v. 6),remains unchangeable; and if, for the chastisement of wickedness and thefurther promoting of His own glory, He doth arise, even to shake terribly theearth, who then may oppose Him and prosper?</p> 
<p>　　We remain, in the love of the gospel, your friends and brethren.</p> 
<p>　　(Signed by fourteen Friends.)Scrupling to do writings relative to keeping slaves has been a means ofsundry small trials to me, in which I have so evidently felt my own will setaside, that I think it good to mention a few of them. Tradesmen and retailersof goods, who depend on their business for a living, are naturally inclined tokeep the good-will of their customers; nor is it a pleasant thing for young mento be under any necessity to question the judgment or honesty of elderly men,and more especially of such as have a fair reputation. Deep-rooted customs,though wrong, are not easily altered; but it is the duty of all to be firm inthat which they certainly know is right for them. A charitable, benevolent man,well acquainted with a negro, may, I believe, under some circumstances, keephim in his family as a servant, on no other motives than the negro's good; butman, as man, knows not what shall be after him, nor hath he any assurance thathis children will attain to that perfection in wisdom and goodness necessaryrightly to exercise such power; hence it is clear to me, that I ought not to bethe scribe where wills are drawn in which some children are made sale-mastersover others during life.</p> 
<p>　　About this time an ancient man of good esteem in the neighbourhood came to myhouse to get his will written. He had young negroes, and I asked him privatelyhow he purposed to dispose of them. He told me. I then said, "I cannot writethy will without breaking my own peace," and respectfully gave him my reasonsfor it. He signified that he had a choice that I should have written it, but asI could not, consistently with my conscience, he did not desire it, and so hegot it written by some other person. A few years after, there being greatalterations in his family, he came again to get me to write his will. Hisnegroes were yet young, and his son, to whom he intended to give them, was,since he first spoke to me, from a libertine become a sober young man, and hesupposed that I would have been free on that account to write it. We had muchfriendly talk on the subject, and then deferred it. A few days after he cameagain and directed their freedom, and I then wrote his will.</p> 
<p>　　Near the time that the last-mentioned Friend first spoke to me, a neighbourreceived a bad bruise in his body and sent for me to bleed him, which havingdone, he desired me to write his will. I took notes, and amongst other thingshe told me to which of his children he gave his young negro. I considered thepain and distress he was in, and knew not how it would end, so I wrote hiswill, save only that part concerning his slave, and carrying it to his bedside,read it to him. I then told him in a friendly way that I could not write anyinstruments by which my fellow-creatures were made slaves, without bringingtrouble on my own mind. I let him know that I charged nothing for what I haddone, and desired to be excused from doing the other part in the way heproposed. We then had a serious conference on the subject; at length, heagreeing to set her free, I finished his will.</p> 
<p>　　Having found drawings in my mind to visit Friends on Long Island, afterobtaining a certificate from our Monthly Meeting, I set off 12th of FifthMonth, 1756. When I reached the island, I lodged the first night at the houseof my dear friend, Richard Hallett. The next day being the first of the week, Iwas at the meeting in New Town, in which we experienced the renewedmanifestations of the love of Jesus Christ to the comfort of the honest-hearted. I went that night to Flushing, and the next day I and my belovedfriend, Matthew Franklin, crossed the ferry at White Stone; were at threemeetings on the main, and then returned to the island, where I spent theremainder of the week in visiting meetings. The Lord, I believe, hath a peoplein those parts who are honestly inclined to serve him; but many I fear, are toomuch clogged with the things of this life, and do not come forward bearing thecross in such faithfulness as He calls for.</p> 
<p>　　My mind was deeply engaged in this visit, both in public and private, and atseveral places where I was, on observing that they had slaves, I found myselfunder a necessity, in a friendly way, to labour with them on that subject;expressing, as way opened, the inconsistency of that practice with the purityof the Christian religion, and the ill effects of it manifested amongst us.</p> 
<p>　　The latter end of the week their Yearly Meeting began; at which were ourfriends, John Scarborough, Jane Hoskins, and Susannah Brown, from Pennsylvania.</p> 
<p>　　The public meetings were large, and measurably favoured with divine goodness.</p> 
<p>　　The exercise of my mind at this meeting was chiefly on account of those whowere considered as the foremost rank in the Society; and in a meeting ofministers and elders way opened for me to express in some measure what lay uponme; and when Friends were met for transacting the affairs of the church, havingsat awhile silent, I felt a weight on my mind, and stood up; and through thegracious regard of our Heavenly Father, strength was given fully to clearmyself of a burden which for some days had been increasing upon me.</p> 
<p>　　Through the humbling dispensations of divine Providence, men are sometimesfitted for His service. The messages of the prophet Jeremiah were sodisagreeable to the people, and so adverse to the spirit they lived in, that hebecame the object of their reproach, and in the weakness of nature he thoughtof desisting from his prophetic office; but saith he, "His word was in my heartas a burning fire shut up in my bones; and I was weary with forbearing, andcould not stay." I saw at this time that, if I was honest in declaring thatwhich truth opened in me, I could not please all men; and I laboured to becontent in the way of my duty, however disagreeable to my own inclination.</p> 
<p>　　After this I went homeward, taking Woodbridge and Plainfield in my way, in bothwhich meetings the pure influence of divine love was manifested, in an humblingsense whereof I went home. I had been out about twenty-four days, and rode While I was out on this journey my heart was much affected with a sense ofthe state of the churches in our southern provinces; and believing the Lord wascalling me to some further labour amongst them, I was bowed in reverence beforeHim, with fervent desires that I might find strength to resign myself to Hisheavenly will.</p> 
<p>　　Until this year, 1756, I continued to retail goods, besides following mytrade as a tailor; about which time I grew uneasy on account of my businessgrowing too cumbersome. I had begun with selling trimmings for garments, andfrom thence proceeded to sell cloths and linens; and at length, having got aconsiderable shop of goods, my trade increased every year, and the way to largebusiness appeared open, but I felt a stop in my mind.</p> 
<p>　　Through the mercies of the Almighty, I had, in a good degree, learned to becontent with a plain way of living. I had but a small family; and, on seriousconsideration, believed truth did not require me to engage much in cumberingaffairs. It had been my general practice to buy and sell things really useful.</p> 
<p>　　Things that served chiefly to please the vain mind in people, I was not easy totrade in; seldom did it; and whenever I did I found it weaken me as aChristian.</p> 
<p>　　The increase of business became my burden; for though my natural inclinationwas toward merchandise, yet I believed truth required me to live more free fromoutward cumbers; and there was now a strife in my mind between the two. In thisexercise my prayers were put up to the Lord, who graciously heard me, and gaveme a heart resigned to His holy will. Then I lessened my outward business, and,as I had opportunity, told my customers of my intentions, that they mightconsider what shop to turn to; and in a while I wholly laid down merchandise,and followed my trade as a tailor by myself, having no apprentice. I also had anursery of apple trees, in which I employed some of my time in hoeing,grafting, trimming, and inoculating.(2) In merchandise it is the custom where Ilived to sell chiefly on credit, and poor people often get in debt; whenpayment is expected, not having wherewith to pay, their creditors often sue forit at law. Having frequently observed occurrences of this kind, I found it goodfor me to advise poor people to take such goods as were most useful, and notcostly.</p> 
<p>　　In the time of trading I had an opportunity of seeing that the too liberaluse of spirituous liquors and the custom of wearing too costly apparel led somepeople into great inconveniences; and that these two things appear to be oftenconnected with each other. By not attending to that use of things which isconsistent with universal righteousness, there is an increase of labour whichextends beyond what our Heavenly Father intends for us. And by great labour,and often by much sweating, there is even among such as are not drunkards acraving of liquors to revive the spirits; that partly by the luxurious drinkingof some, and partly by the drinking of others (led to it through immoderate labour), very great quantities of rum are every year consumed in our colonies;the greater part of which we should have no need of, did we steadily attend topure wisdom.</p> 
<p>　　When men take pleasure in feeling their minds elevated with strong drink, andso indulge their appetite as to disorder their understandings, neglect theirduty as members of a family or civil society, and cast off all regard toreligion, their case is much to be pitied. And where those whose lives are forthe most part regular, and whose examples have a strong influence on the mindsof others, adhere to some customs which powerfully draw to the use of morestrong liquor than pure wisdom allows, it hinders the spreading of the spiritof meekness, and strengthens the hands of the more excessive drinkers. This isa case to be lamented.</p> 
<p>　　Every degree of luxury hath some connection with evil; and if those whoprofess to be disciples of Christ, and are looked upon as leaders of thepeople, have that mind in them which was also in Christ, and so stand separatefrom every wrong way, it is a means of help to the weaker. As I have sometimesbeen much spent in the heat and have taken spirits to revive me, I have foundby experience that in such circumstances the mind is not so calm, nor so fitlydisposed for divine meditation, as when all such extremes are avoided. I havefelt an increasing care to attend to that Holy Spirit which sets right boundsto our desires, and leads those who faithfully follow it, to apply all thegifts of divine Providence to the purposes for which they were intended. Didthose who have the care of great estates attend with singleness of heart tothis heavenly Instructor, which so opens and enlarges the mind as to cause mento love their neighbours as themselves, they would have wisdom given them tomanage their concerns, without employing some people in providing luxuries oflife, or others in labouring too hard; but for want of steadily regarding thisprinciple of divine love, a selfish spirit takes place in the minds of people,which is attended with darkness and manifold confusions in the world.</p> 
<p>　　Though trading in things useful is an honest employ, yet through the greatnumber of superfluities which are bought and sold, and through the corruptionof the times, they who apply to merchandise for a living have great need to bewell experienced in that precept which the Prophet Jeremiah laid down for hisscribe: "Seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not."In the winter this year I was engaged with friends in visiting families, andthrough the goodness of the Lord we often-times experienced his heart-tenderingpresence amongst us.</p> 
<p>　　A Copy of a Letter written to a Friend"In this, thy late affliction, I have found a deep fellow-feeling withthee, and have had a secret hope throughout, that it might please the Father ofMercies to raise thee up and sanctify thy troubles to thee; that thou being more fully acquainted with that way which the world esteems foolish, mayst feelthe clothing of divine fortitude, and be strengthened to resist that spiritwhich leads from the simplicity of the everlasting truth.</p> 
<p>　　"We may see ourselves crippled and halting, and from a strong bias tothings pleasant and easy, find an impossibility to advance forward; but thingsimpossible with men are possible with God; and our wills being made subject toHis, all temptations are surmountable.</p> 
<p>　　"This work of subjecting the will is compared to the mineral in thefurnace, which, through fervent heat, is reduced from its first principle: 'Herefines them as silver is refined; he shall sit as a refiner and purifier ofsilver.' By these comparisons, we are instructed in the necessity of themelting operation of the hand of God upon us, to prepare our hearts truly toadore Him, and manifest that adoration by inwardly turning away from thatspirit, in all its workings, which is not of Him. To forward this work the all-wise God is sometimes pleased, through outward distress, to bring us near thegates of death; that life being painful and afflicting, and the prospect ofeternity opened before us, all earthly bonds may be loosened, and the mindprepared for that deep and sacred instruction which otherwise would not bereceived. If kind parents love their children and delight in their happiness,then He who is perfect goodness in sending abroad mortal contagions dothassuredly direct their use. Are the righteous removed by it? their change ishappy. Are the wicked taken away in their wickedness? the Almighty is clear. Dowe pass through with anguish and great bitterness, and yet recover? He intendsthat we should be purged from dross, and our ear opened to discipline.</p> 
<p>　　"And now, as thou art again restored, after thy sore affliction and doubtsof recovery, forget not Him who hath helped thee, but in humble gratitude holdfast His instructions, and thereby shun those by-paths which lead from the firmfoundation. I am sensible of that variety of company to which one in thybusiness must be exposed; I have painfully felt the force of conversationproceeding from men deeply rooted in an earthly mind, and can sympathize withothers in such conflicts, because much weakness still attends me.</p> 
<p>　　"I find that to be a fool as to worldly wisdom, and to commit my cause toGod, not fearing to offend men, who take offence at the simplicity of truth, isthe only way to remain unmoved at the sentiments of others.</p> 
<p>　　"The fear of man brings a snare. By halting in our duty, and giving back inthe time of trial, our hands grow weaker, our spirits get mingled with thepeople, our ears grow dull as to hearing the language of the true Shepherd, sothat when we look at the way of the righteous, it seems as though it was notfor us to follow them.</p> 
<p>　　"A love clothes my mind while I write, which is superior to all expression;and I find my heart open to encourage to a holy emulation, to advance forward in Christian firmness. Deep humility is a strong bulwark, and as we enter intoit we find safety and true exaltation. The foolishness of God is wiser thanman, and the weakness of God is stronger than man. Being unclothed of our ownwisdom, and knowing the abasement of the creature, we find that power to arisewhich gives health and vigour to us."</p>
