Battle of You City</h2> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-xs-12" id="chapter-content"> <p>“Gou’zi, did you give it pig feed? How did it grow so fat?”Lin Fan recalled that when he left, the nine-headed bug was still the size of a dog. How did it turn from a small water gun into a giant tank after only such a short period of time?The change was just too huge and he nearly couldn’t recognize it.Gou’zi scratched his head and said helplessly, “Young Master, I really didn’t feed it any pig feed. It ate the same things that we ate and it consumed a lot of food too. It ate up a large portion of the money that you left.”“Eh?” Lin Fan looked at Nine Demon. With its size and its nine heads, if it really started eating, normal people definitely wouldn’t be able to stop it. “Why did you give it so much to eat? You should have just given it something simple.”It seemed like Gou’zi thought that since it was his pet, he had to treat it well. This was why he cooked such good food, resulting in it becoming so fat.If Nine Demon could speak, it would definitely argue that it wasn’t fat, that it was just growing from childhood to adulthood.It was just becoming stronger, not fatter.“Young Master, now that you are back, you shouldn’t be leaving, right?” Gou’zi asked.Lin Fan retracted his gaze, “I am leaving. I am actually leaving soon.”Gou’zi didn’t expect Young Master to leave right after returning. What had happened? He felt like he was useless; apart from cleaning and cooking, he didn’t know how to do anything else.In the past, he wanted to work hard and cultivate.But he noticed that he really wasn’t cut out for it; he had no talent at all.“Young Master, where are you going?” Gou’zi asked.Lin Fan said, “I have something to do and will only return after a period of time. Martial Path Mountain depends on you all. Right, tell Young Master Huang that our sect has development potential and tell him not to worry. Once the matter is settled, I will develop the sect.”He could only apologize to Young Master Huang.His investment only went to waste and could only be placed aside to stew. He had to calm down. There was no need for him to be too anxious.“Cough cough!”At that point, Feng Poliu walked over from afar. When he saw Lin Fan, he coughed a few times like he had something to say.At the side of the cliff.“You headed to the border?” Feng Poliu asked. Actually, he didn’t need to think much because he sensed that this kid had definitely gone there.“You are even able to sense that?” Lin Fan looked towards Feng Poliu with a weird expression. He really didn’t expect that this fellow would actually get it right.Feng Poliu said, “I sensed it. The situation there is a little nervous. You are going to head to You City?”He noticed that the aura that Lin Fan gave off was really mystical. It made him feel like he was a totally different person from before. This could only mean that this kid’s strength became even more terrifying, so terrifying that he couldn’t guess how strong he was.Horrifying!How long had passed?He remembered that when he first knew this kid, he didn’t have much cultivation.To him, this was totally impossible.Lin Fan looked at him and said, “I really didn’t expect that your guesses would be so accurate. But don’t tell anyone. I do indeed want to head back to You City. The Alliance is really aggressive there and I am worried about my Father. Also, don’t tell me about the dangers. With my current strength, even without attacking and relying solely on pressure, I would be able to crush you. I am very strong now.”At the start, Feng Poliu was slightly touched. This kid was so filial.But shortly after, he felt like something was not right.What do you mean by using aura to crush me?Did I ask you about your cultivation? No? You were the one who spoke of it… Was there a need to stab me in the dark?The good impression he just had of him instantly vanished.Not even a single shred of it was left.Feng Poliu said, “I didn’t say anything about danger. Actually, with your cultivation, you are quite strong outside, but it probably won’t be enough outside. Although I have never helped at the border before, based on what I know, there are just too many experts over there.”“Keke, why do your words sound like I am not scary at all. Forget it, I don’t want to show off how strong I am in front of you. There is no need for me to do so.” Lin Fan wanted to let Feng Poliu see how strong he was but forget it…He wasn’t someone to show off.What was the benefit of letting him see anything?Could he garner any applause?Feng Poliu kept silent for a moment before saying, “If the defense is broken through, then I will bring them to the Imperial Dynasty.”Lin Fan lifted his hand. “Wait, why do I feel like you think that You City will definitely be broken through? Feng Poliu, your mouth is just so foul.”“Just in case, who could say for certain?” Feng Poliu said.Although he didn’t participate in the battle, he did pay attention to the border situation.The battle at You City was really intense and a little pessimistic. Many huge battles happened there and the outcome wasn’t certain yet. No one was sure about how the entire battle would turn out in the end.Lin Fan nodded, “Eh, if it is really wiped out, then remember to tell those in Jiang City to retreat quickly.”“Nonsense, did you even have to say that?” Feng Poliu said. But the moment he thought about Junior Brother, the color on is face became much dimmer. He didn’t expect that he would actually be the visitor under Zhao Family’s Eight Little Miss and would have to serve her in the future.The key was that competition between the young generations of the Zhao Family were really intense and he was afraid that Junior Brother wouldn’t be able to hold on.Lin Fan returned to Martial Path Mountain to take a look at the situation.It was still okay.The only thing was that cousin left Martial Path Mountain and he didn’t know where he had gone. Although cousin was a little slow sometimes, he was good at everything else, and probably nothing bad would happen to him.“You aren’t staying for a while?” Feng Poliu asked.Lin Fan waved his hands. “No. I am leaving now. Don’t tell them that I am heading to You City.”Feng Poliu was helpless, “Go, but remember, your life is the most important thing. I will take care of Martial Path Mountain, but when are you going to give me my monthly salary? Where is the silver we agreed upon?”Lin Fan rose up into the air and headed towards You City. A voice spread out after he left.“No.”“You…” Feng Poliu looked at the disappearing back view and he wanted to curse. But forget it. He looked into the distance and muttered, are the young generation nowadays so fierce?He felt that he was old now and couldn’t keep up with the modern-day tempo.“Where is Young master?” Gou’zi ran out and asked.Feng Poliu kept silent for a moment and opened his arms. He exclaimed, “He left with the wind.”When Gou’zi heard this, he wanted to smack Feng Poliu’s head.What in the world are you saying?You are the one to leave with the wind.“Then, do you know where he went?” Gou’zi asked.Feng Poliu said, “I don’t know.”Gou’zi wasn’t dumb and didn’t believe what Feng Poliu said. Whoever believed Feng Poliu was a fool, but he understood that Young Master was the one who told Feng Poliu not to tell him.Yuan Tianchu’s heart jumped when he heard that Lin Fan came back.He was thinking all day long about what Lin Fan and Zhang Tianshan were thinking about. He felt like their battle was god-tier and mortals like him were suffering. He was such a mortal.He snuck out and saw Lin Fan and Feng Poliu talking. Not long later, Lin Fan flew into the air and disappeared too.What!Those scenes caused Yuan Tianchu to be totally stunned.What was going on?He just came back and left again?His mind was in a mess. In the past, he could have guessed what Lin Fan and Zhang Tianshan were planning, but now he was totally lost and he didn’t know where to start.Everything was just so weird and mysterious.Liang Yongqi was really afraid of Yuan Tianchu.Although as a Senior Brother he had the power to manage him, he didn’t dare to. He felt like Yuan Tianchu was becoming more and more abnormal.Sometimes when he got close, he could hear Yuan Tianchu muttering to himself.“How did this happen?”“Why did he do that?”“I really don’t understand, I really don’t understand.”….After he heard those words, Liang Yongqi would distance himself.He was really afraid that he would anger Yuan Tianchu and then Yuan Tianchu would slice him to death with one blade. If that really happened, then he would die for no reason at all.Nine Demon wasn’t able to gain Master’s love and was a little unhappy.Its nine heads shook in the air and its nose seemed to be trying to sniff something.Gou’zi stood to the side and was really stunned.He was thinking about where Young Master had gone.Suddenly, he exclaimed. Nine Demon bit into his clothes and tossed him on its back. It then ran down the mountain.“Nine Demon, where are you going?” Gou’zi panicked as he clung onto Nine Demon’s neck and shouted.Nine Demon didn’t worry about him and didn’t stop. It ran into the distance.Lin Fan left Martial Path Mountain and he looked solemnly into the distance.You City, I am back.Although he didn’t reach the peak, with his current strength, it was definitely enough to stun his father. What would his expression be like when he saw all this?He thought long and hard about it but he couldn’t think of an exact expression.But he would probably be really shocked, right?He cultivated many cultivation techniques now and when all of it was used, he would even be able to destroy someone at Yin Yang Realm. After he used Bug Transformation, his body quality would also gain a huge buff.When he thought about that power, his heart swelled a little.If one rode a horse, one would take half a month to get from Martial Path Mountain to You City. But with Lin Fan’s current speed, he only needed a day, maybe even less than that.There weren’t many people left in You City and they were all God Essence Realm and below. Their cultivation wasn’t weak outside, but they could only remain in You City. They couldn’t cross over.As for the Alliance’s side, everyone else was above God Essence Realm.“Damn, these bunch of people are attacking much more aggressively.”“The one who wanted to break open the most is You City. If it wasn’t for Master Lin, we wouldn’t have been able to hold on for so long.”In You City, many people discussed with furious emotions.At the same time, they had to take care of the injured.Those injured members were all sent back from the Alliance land. They suffered really serious injuries in the huge battle.“Let me go, I can still fight.” A middle-aged man’s chest was covered in blood and one could even smell the scent of decomposing meat.The people around him pressed him down.“Stop moving about. Your injuries are too heavy. You might die.” When they saw such scenes, they were furious.They wanted to charge into the Alliance land, but they were just too weak and couldn’t even fly. Even if they went over, they weren’t even strong enough to be cannon fodder.Suddenly, someone ran over from outside the city and exclaimed, “Not good, Young Master Lin is back.”Those people were stunned like they didn’t expect it to happen.The middle-aged man who was shouting to fight again said, “Carry me into the room and close the door. We definitely can’t be found by Young Master Lin. Master Lin only has one son, so he definitely can’t stay here.”“Go to Lin Manor and inform Manager Chen and tell him to welcome him at the city entrance.”All those who were badly injured and could only cry out to lessen their pain directly placed their weapons in their mouths and bit onto them. Their eyes opened wide and beads of sweat appeared on their foreheads.They bore with the pain and didn’t allow themselves to make any sound at all.Lin Manor.When Manager Chen learned that Young master was back, he was so shocked that he didn’t know what to do.Now, Old Wu and the others were over at the Alliance’s side and there wasn’t anyone here.No, we definitely can’t let Young Master find out any problems, so I have to send him away.Manager Chen headed towards the city gate. He had to rush there before Young Master reached the city.If he couldn’t he could only knock Young Master out and then let someone send him away.Lin Fan landed from the sky.He walked on the ground and looked at the not so majestic You City.“Who knew that I would come back so soon?” Lin Fan smiled. But he knew that after he returned, he would join in the Alliance Battle. That made him really nervous.At the city gate, Manager Chen sneakily watched on. When he saw Young Master, he was really nervous. Old Wu wasn’t here, so he was alone and he felt like he wasn’t good enough.There were very few people on the streets, but many of them had set up their stalls to sell items.Just as Lin Fan entered, Manager Chen strolled out. When he saw Lin Fan he exclaimed, “Young Master, why did you come back?”Lin Fan smiled, “Why? Are you very shocked to see me?”Act, continue to act.I want to see how long you all can act. Do you really think that I won’t notice anything like the last time?“Young Master, how am I not shocked that you are back? Old Master has been thinking about you every day.” Manager Chen smiled and replied. He panicked more and more and didn’t know what to do?Lin Fan walked towards the center of the city with Manager Chen beside him. Manager Chen was so anxious that his hands started to sweat.Inside, he was shouting:What should I do, what should I do?Someone save me.Lin Fan looked at the situation inside. There were fewer people and the stalls weren’t complete. Many shops were closed too.Hey!It was already so obvious and they were still trying to hide. Good, let’s see how good their acting skills were to be able to bluff him until now.“Manager Chen, what happened to the city? Why are there so few people? Where did they all go?” Lin Fan asked curiously. He wanted to see how Manager Chen was about to weave a story.Manager Chen panicked a little but quickly thought of a reply, “Recently, the neighboring city had a large scale event, so many people went to see.”“Oh.”Lin Fan replied. Wow, he really said such a lie that would only work on small children.It seemed like his intelligence was just so low to them.“Stall owner, your vegetables aren’t selling well.” Lin Fan walked to one stall and looked at the vegetables before asking.The owner was a middle-aged man and he wasn’t very old but half of his head was bald.“Young Master Lin, it really isn’t easy to sell.” The owner gave a wide smile. Beneath the stall was an injured person, who was bearing with the pain. He didn’t dare to make a sound at all.As they had been too rushed, they didn’t have time to retreat, so he could only hide here.Lin Fan said, “Of course, it is hard to sell. Look at how bad your vegetables are. Are you trying to cheat people of money?”The moment he said this, he continued to walk forwards.The owner lowered his head and saw that the vegetables were all yellow. He felt like he had messed up. Had Young Master realized anything?“Manager Chen, why didn’t the meat seller open?” Lin Fan asked.Manager Chen’s hand was sweating more and more, “Young Master, he must’ve have gone to visit his relatives. He left a while ago.”Lin Fan didn’t say anything and continued to walk forwards.When the people saw him, they would move aside respectfully. At the same time, their gazes were really polite.It was like they remembered how Lin Fan fought with the Yuan and Liang families.“Good acting.” Lin Fan was impressed, how amazing. If he hadn’t spent time in the other border cities, he might have really believed them.Manager Chen followed behind him. Not only were his hands sweating, but even his forehead was too.What should he do?What should he do? If they returned to the manor, things would definitely fall apart.Manager Chen glanced to the side and realized that one of the people was lifting his hand and pointing at the back of his neck like he was telling him to not worry and just knock him out.Manager Chen shook his head. He didn’t dare to; he was afraid that he would harm Young Master.The people around frowned as if they were saying that if he didn’t dare and they reached Lin Manor, what could they say?He kept silent for a long while.Manager Chen decided that if this was the case, then he could only knock Young Master out. Otherwise, there was nothing else he could do.Thus, he nodded towards everyone and walked towards Young Master. He sneakily raised his hand and didn’t dare to use too much strength, only enough to knock him out.Shua!Manager Chen was really quick. He waved his arm and his hand felt made contact with the back of Lin Fan’s neck with a smacking sound.Under normal circumstances, Young Master would have cried out and fallen to the ground. He would have helped carry him up and that would have been perfect.But the situation now wasn’t right.When his hand landed, nothing happened to Young Master at all.Lin Fan touched his neck, turned around, and squinted. “Manager Chen, what is the meaning of this?”“Young master, I..” Manager Chen was covered in a cold sweat like he had just taken a shower. His hands and legs felt cold as he didn’t expect that this would happen. The strength he used wasn’t a lot but it wasn’t weak either. With Young master’s situation, how…Peng!Just as Lin Fan turned around, one of the experts who acted as a passer-by slashed down onto his neck.This was much stronger than Manager Chen’s strike. If it landed on a normal person, they would faint for at least a day.If the Alliance didn’t attack, and everyone was hiding, then this person was in charge of carrying goods.The guy lowered his head and looked at his hands. He then looked up at Lin Fan with a complicated expression. He was totally stunned.No way.That attack was really strong.Lin Fan took in a deep breath and said, “That is enough, stop playing with hand blades. I want to know what you all are thinking.”Just as Lin Fan turned around and looked at that guy, many people struck and were prepared to attack him with hand blades.Pata!Lin Fan didn’t even look. He just raised his hand and grabbed that guy’s wrist.“Enough, how long do you want to act? It is just the Alliance. Act, act, act. If I wasn’t smart, you all would have lied to me for my entire life.”Uproar!Everyone around was shocked, showing looks of disbelief.They didn’t expect that Young Master would actually know about it.Manager Chen was astonished. “Young Master, you know all about it?”Lin Fan looked at him. “What do you think?”“You City, this doesn’t concern me. Old Master wanted to hide it from you. But this place is dangerous and if you don’t want Old Master to worry, then leave You City just for a while.” Manager Chen said.He knew that Old Master’s only weakness was Young Master.Only Young Master could distract him.“Okay, let’s not talk about all this. Where is Father?” Lin Fan asked.Manager Chen didn’t hide anything, “OId Master and the others have gone over to the other side and are intercepting the Alliance. We are too weak and can only work on backline logistics.”Lin Fan nodded. As expected, it was no different from what he found out at Laoshan City.Father had really attacked the Alliance’s land.“Eh, understood. Also, you all are really amazing at acting. I nearly believed your lies.”Lin Fan felt really terrified just thinking about it.The people who lived around were all acting. Maybe because they felt like it didn’t make sense they allowed normal people to come to You City to mix real and fake people, making it hard for one to guess real from fake.“Young Master, this…” Manager Chen scratched his head. It was really awkward, he didn’t know what to say.“Okay, no matter whether it was real or fake, all of you are great people.” They were indeed great. If he hadn’t known about the Alliance from elsewhere, he really wouldn’t have realized that You City was fighting against the Alliance.After the people learned that Young Master Lin knew the truth, the people who were hiding all cried out in pain.Some of them were badly injured.The pain nearly drove them mad.Lin Fan looked at the experts. They suffered horrific injuries that if normal people were to have sustained, would have died from the pain.“Young Master, since you are back, then first… first…”Manager Chen didn’t finish his sentence and fell to the ground, he looked into the sky like he had seen a ghost.He didn’t expect Young Master to fly.Wasn’t that an ability that only someone at God Essence Realm had?When Young Master left You City, his cultivation was quite normal.Land of the Alliance.“Lin Wanyi, the Alliance will give you one more chance to join us. We promise you that you will become the new master of the Imperial Dynasty, that is the biggest concession that Alliance Headquarters can give you.” An Alliance general said.“Nonsense, why are you talking so much nonsense? The Alliance only sent you trash?” Lin Wanyi floated in mid-air and raged.The Alliance sent 12 generals here. That was enough to show how much importance they placed on the situation over at You City.“Master Lin, the Alliance really takes care of us.” Zhu Shen laughed. The machete in his hand was buzzing like he couldn’t take it anymore.Zhu Shen, who was given the title of the top blade of the Imperial Dynasty, was terrifyingly strong. He once sliced apart the air around heaven and earth and Lin Wanyi suppressed him and made him wait for the Alliance at You City.This wait was a full few decades and he couldn’t take it anymore.“Master Lin, Zhu Shen, and I will restrict four generals.” Zhang Sheng said as the Treasurer of Drunk Fragrance Pavilion. If the Alliance didn’t come, he would really think that his true job was that of a restaurant owner.Old Wu said, “Old Master, I can restrict two generals.”Lin Wanyi said, “Not you, you can restrict at most one. Two is too much for you.”Zhang Sheng smiled, “Brother Wu, listen to Master Lin, you just take one. Leave the rest to us.”“Haha, that’s right. Brother Wu, we will take the remaining seven.” The old man standing around at the side laughed.You City was really strong. Zhu Shen, Zhang Sheng, and the others weren’t the only ones who could clash with generals.They had hid themselves until now. What was the purpose of that?It was to fight against generals from Alliance!Of course, there might have been a gap between generals and them, but there were many of them. If one couldn’t win, then they would fight with two.Honglong!Honglong!Suddenly, a heavy and low sound spread out from the distance.Lin Wanyi’s expression was solemn. His target wasn’t the 12 generals in front of him, but the true expert sent from the Alliance Headquarters.At this moment, the low voice from afar was like thunder to everyone’s ears.A person walked over.The Alliance members all made way and respectfully welcomed the expert.Their eyes were filled with respect.“The strongest general in the Alliance.”When Lin Wanyi saw this person, his breathing became rushed like he had seen his biggest enemy. His throat gave out a beast-like roar.“Zhu Daoshen…”At that moment, the experts on this side were all stunned.It was obvious that the name Zhu Daoshen made them feel that something wasn’t right.He was one of the strongest generals in Alliance.His reputation in the Alliance was much bigger than those of other generals.“Lin Wanyi, I specifically came from the Alliance Headquarters to find you.” Zhu Daoshen’s voice was thick and when he spoke up, the air seemed to be squeezed, forming a shockwave that spread out.Zhu Daoshen’s physique was really strong and because he trained his body to such a high level, he looked middle-aged. But actually, he was much older than Lin Wanyi.At that moment, Zhu Daoshen was floating into the air. The 12 generals made way. Although they were all generals, in terms of status and identity, the gap was huge.“Lin Wanyi, the Alliance Headquarters really respects you, otherwise, they wouldn’t have sent me here. You are a genius, a genius that has grown up. Unfortunately, you are stubborn and plan on defending this useless place. You are just dumb.” Zhu Daoshen squinted his eyes and smiled.He looked towards the land in the distance and was slightly annoyed.“Gang Xiong, what are you doing? Scram!”Honglong!The earth shook.The strongest land general in the Alliance came out from the ground. Although he was a little annoyed when talking to Zhu Daoshen, he didn’t dare to go against his orders.“Tell me, why are you hiding in the ground?” Zhu Daoshen asked.Gang Xiong felt like he had lost his dignity. This fellow didn’t give him any respect at all. He was hiding underground. As for what he was doing, couldn’t he understand?“I am not doing anything.” Gang Xiong said.Zhu Daoshen took a look at him, “Scram! I am fighting with Lin Wanyi, so none of you should interfere. Otherwise, don’t bear me for being heartless.”Even if Gang Xiong was unwilling, he had no choice but to move aside.Lin Wanyi locked his eyes on Zhu Daoshen. 12 generals and Gang Xiong, a total of 13 of them wouldn’t give him any pressure at all.But the appearance of Zhu Daoshen meant that he had to go all out.“Zhu Shen, be careful. Gang Xiong isn’t weak.” Lin Wanyi reminded.Zhu Shen nodded. “Understood, I will restrict these generals. Master Lin, be careful.”“Eh.” Lin Wanyi looked at him and said, “We will settle all debts, I have waited for you for so many years.”….Lin Fan came to the border and a crack appeared there.His heart jumped really quickly.He was about to meet his father, so he was really nervous.When he stepped in, he sensed a terrifying aura that spread across the sky such that it was hard for one to breathe.He looked into the distance.He was shocked.In the sky in the distance, many bright lights shone. Many cracks appeared in space like a dense spiderweb.“Father…” Lin Fan looked into the distance at the person he wanted to find. His father was fighting someone else. That area belonged solely to them and no one could get close.Many never before seen phenomenons exploded out in that area.The space there seemed like it was made of paper.Terrifying void currents were grabbed out like toys and used as weapons. The entire area was turned on its head.Even if Lin Fan went over, he would be instantly ripped to pieces.You City experts and those of the Alliance clashed with one another.Corpses fell like dumplings from the sky.Many fireworks-like scenes exploded out in the air and formed a terrifying shockwave.A chaotic battle, a terrifying chaotic battle.“I can’t continue waiting, I need to help.” Lin Fan kept silent for a while and clenched his fists. What should he do?His move with the biggest area of effect damage.There was only…Refresh.Dragon Elephant Sword Technique, Ten Thousand Sword Technique, Great Sumeru Sword were all not at the Return to True Realm.He refreshed and pushed the three of them to the top realm.Weng!The sword seed in his body trembled and three terrifying sword energies wrapped over around the seed and helped to strengthen it.“As expected.”As for the person who said that he had no little brother if he used the sword, that didn’t matter. So what if he didn’t have it? It was okay as long as he was alive.Lin Fan lifted his hand and touched his stomach.“Sword Seed!”Shua!A sword seed floated out from behind him.He didn’t hurry out as it was not enough. He needed to be stronger. He needed to rely on his unlimited True Essence to form the strongest sword seed.Shua!Shua!At that moment, many sword seeds floated behind him. Due to the strong sword intent, it directly formed a Sword Intent storm.The number of sword seeds went from hundreds to thousands to tens of thousands.For normal people, a sword seed was their final attack which drained their body of everything.But to Lin Fan, it was just his most destructive attack.At that moment, the sword seed floating behind him reached a terrifying amount. The area around was ripped apart by the sharp Sword Intent. Even the space couldn’t take it and started to crack.He activated all his techniques. All the special internal strengths buffed each and every sword seed.Various different colored lights spun about.All sorts of terrifying auras wrapped around them.If someone saw that, they would definitely exclaim.I want to report, someone is hacking.….Honglong.Lin Wanyi and Zhu Daoshen were on par. It was a really intense battle and both sides had small injuries.Suddenly, a familiar voice spread over.“Father, I am back.”Lin Wanyi’s face was filled with shock. He turned around like he had seen a ghost and when he saw this person, he became really emotional. But that turned into rage, “Unfilial kid, why did you return?”When he heard that familiar term, Lin Fan was about to cry.It was a long time since someone called him that.“Father, I am back to help you defend against the Alliance.” Lin Fan shouted.“Young Master.” Old Wu turned around and his expression changed. Why had Young Master come back at such a moment?Lin Wanyi was so furious that he nearly smacked the kid away with a slap. “You came back… Kid, run.”When he said this, he saw people heading towards Lin Fan.Such that he was so terrified that his face turned white.Suddenly, the area around shook.“Ah!”Lin Fan opened his arms and veins popped up from his forehead like it was really arduous and difficult.Damn.There were too many sword seeds and the pressure was so huge that he was about to die.Xiu!The sword seeds that covered the entire sky flew into the distance. Like the milky way, they hung across the sky.Terrifying Sword Intent rang out and ripped at the air around.They had turned into an actual physical form.The Alliance experts who headed towards Lin Fan stopped in their tracks. Their eyes opened wide like they had seen ghosts.“Father, I am back to help.”“Go forwards!”Lin Fan pressed his hands down. It was the move that contained his life’s work, no, not only one move, many moves.At that moment, no matter if it was someone from You City or someone from Alliance, they were all astonished by these scenes.Xiu!Xiu!The sword seeds moved really quickly, and in the blink of an eye, they ripped across the space around and suppressed the battlefield.“Young Master?” Old Wu’s eyes opened wide. In his heart, the Young Master in his heart was a slacker who did nothing and was only waiting to die. But the Young Master who appeared was so scary that he nearly fell to the ground. That was impossible.Very quickly, a strong wind blew over onto the bodies of everyone and they found it unbearable.It was the Sword Intent storm that formed once one’s Sword Intent accumulated to a certain amount.“What terrifying Sword Intent!”The Alliance generals sensed this Sword Intent and frowned slightly. But very quickly, they thought back to a terrifying thing.As generals, these little tricks weren’t much, but other people might not have been able to block them.“Retreat, all of you retreat.” A general shouted in rage.He understood how terrifying that move was.But the moment he said this, numerous sword seeds appeared beside him and exploded.“Damn.”That general was perfectly fine but such an explosion infuriated him.He sensed the power of the explosion and was shocked. He turned his head.He noticed that an innumerable number of sword seeds had entered the battlefield.These seeds seemed to be controlled, speeding past the You City members and targetting clearly those from the Alliance.How was that possible?To control so much Sword Intent, how thick must one’s True Essence have been?“General Zhu, the Sword Intent is really strong. We can’t block it.” A general hollered.Zhu Daoshen frowned and raised his hand and slashed down. Instantly, a black glow seemed to split heaven and earth, laying right between Alliance and You City experts.“Explode.”Lin Fan didn’t think that the Alliance general was so strong to be able to slice open the void. But before it formed, exploding the seeds was still useful.Honglong!All the sword seeds entered the void dimension and exploded. A terrifying shockwave spread out.That dimension that wasn’t fully formed shattered. Like a mirror shattering, shrapnel struck towards the Alliance members.“Ah!”Some of them cried out.</p> </div> </div> <div class="row turn-page"> <a class="col-xs-2" href="/I%20Don’t%20Want%20To%20Defy%20The%20Heavens/323.html?v=1662297932479">Previous</a> <a class="col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:center;" href="/I%20Don’t%20Want%20To%20Defy%20The%20Heavens/book.html?v=1662297932473">Table</a> <a class="col-xs-2 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:right;" href="/I%20Don’t%20Want%20To%20Defy%20The%20Heavens/325.html?v=1662297932480"> Next</a> </div> <hr></div><hr><footer class="container"> <p>© Company 2014</p></footer><amp-lightbox id="searchLightbox" class="-il" layout="nodisplay" on="lightboxOpen:searchInput.focus; lightboxClose:searchTriggerOpen.focus" scrollable="" hidden="hidden"> <div> <div class="-ic" role="button" tabindex="0" on="tap:searchLightbox.close"></div> <div class="-ih"> <div class="-sg -sb" on="tap: searchLightbox.close, AMP.setState({ query: '' }), searchForm.clear" role="button" tabindex="0"> <div class="ap-a-ico -sw"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#close"></use> </svg> </div> </div> <div class="ap-o-search-field"> <form action="#" action-xhr="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/echo" class="-ip" id="searchForm" on="submit:AMP.setState({ query: throttledValue }),searchResult.focus" target="_top"> <amp-autocomplete class="-id" filter="substring" min-characters="1" on="select:AMP.setState({ query: event.value })" submit-on-enter="false" src="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/autosuggest"> <div class="ap-a-ico -im"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#search"></use> </svg> </div> <input id="searchInput" class="-iv" name="q" placeholder="What are you looking for?" on="input-throttled:AMP.setState({ throttledValue: event.value })" required=""> <button class="-ig" type="submit" name="search-submit" disabled="" [disabled]="!throttledValue">Search </button> <div role="listbox"></div> </amp-autocomplete> </form> <div class="empty" [class]="query ?
