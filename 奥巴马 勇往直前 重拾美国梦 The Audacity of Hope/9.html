Most Indonesians are of Malay stock and live on the larger islands ofJava, Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Bali. On the far eastern islands like Ambonand the Indonesian portion of New Guinea the people are, in varying degrees, ofMelanesian ancestry. Indonesia’s climate is tropical, and its rain forests were onceteeming with exotic species like the orangutan and the Sumatran tiger. Today, those rainforests are rapidly dwindling, victim to logging, mining, and the cultivation of rice, tea,coffee, and palm oil. Deprived of their natural habitat, orangutans are now anendangered species; no more than a few hundred Sumatran tigers remain in the wild.</p> 
<p>　　With more than 240 million people, Indonesia’s population ranks fourth in the world,behind China, India, and the United States. More than seven hundred ethnic groupsreside within the country’s borders, and more than 742 languages are spoken there.</p> 
<p>　　Almost 90 percent of Indonesia’s population practice Islam, making it the world’slargest Muslim nation. Indonesia is OPEC’s only Asian member, although as aconsequence of aging infrastructure, depleted reserves, and high domestic consumptionit is now a net importer of crude oil. The national language is Bahasa Indonesia. Thecapital is Jakarta. The currency is the rupiah.</p> 
<p>　　Most Americans can’t locate Indonesia on a map.</p> 
<p>　　This fact is puzzling to Indonesians, since for the past sixty years the fate of their nationhas been directly tied to U.S. foreign policy. Ruled by a succession of sultanates andoften-splintering kingdoms for most of its history, the archipelago became a Dutchcolony—the Dutch East Indies—in the 1600s, a status that would last for more thanthree centuries. But in the lead-up to World War II, the Dutch East Indies’ ample oilreserves became a prime target of Japanese expansion; having thrown its lot in with theAxis powers and facing a U.S.-imposed oil embargo, Japan needed fuel for its militaryand industry. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japan moved swiftly to take over theDutch colony, an occupation that would last for the duration of the war.</p> 
<p>　　With the Japanese surrender in 1945, a budding Indonesian nationalist movementdeclared the country’s independence. The Dutch had other ideas, and attempted toreclaim their former territory. Four bloody years of war ensued. Eventually the Dutchbowed to mounting international pressure (the U.S. government, already concerned withthe spread of communism under the banner of anticolonialism, threatened theNetherlands with a cutoff of Marshall Plan funds) and recognized Indonesia’ssovereignty. The principal leader of the independence movement, a charismatic,flamboyant figure named Sukarno, became Indonesia’s first president.</p> 
<p>　　Sukarno proved to be a major disappointment to Washington. Along with Nehru ofIndia and Nasser of Egypt, he helped found the nonaligned movement, an effort bynations newly liberated from colonial rule to navigate an independent path between theWest and the Soviet bloc. Indonesia’s Communist Party, although never formally inpower, grew in size and influence. Sukarno himself ramped up the anti-Westernrhetoric, nationalizing key industries, rejecting U.S. aid, and strengthening ties with theSoviets and China. With U.S. forces knee-deep in Vietnam and the domino theory still acentral tenet of U.S. foreign policy, the CIA began providing covert support to variousinsurgencies inside Indonesia, and cultivated close links with Indonesia’s militaryofficers, many of whom had been trained in the United States. In 1965, under theleadership of General Suharto, the military moved against Sukarno, and underemergency powers began a massive purge of communists and their sympathizers.</p> 
<p>　　According to estimates, between 500,000 and one million people were slaughteredduring the purge, with 750,000 others imprisoned or forced into exile.</p> 
<p>　　It was two years after the purge began, in 1967, the same year that Suharto assumed thepresidency, that my mother and I arrived in Jakarta, a consequence of her remarriage toan Indonesian student whom she’d met at the University of Hawaii. I was six at thetime, my mother twenty-four. In later years my mother would insist that had she knownwhat had transpired in the preceding months, we never would have made the trip. Butshe didn’t know—the full story of the coup and the purge was slow to appear inAmerican newspapers. Indonesians didn’t talk about it either. My stepfather, who hadseen his student visa revoked while still in Hawaii and had been conscripted into theIndonesian army a few months before our arrival, refused to talk politics with mymother, advising her that some things were best forgotten.</p> 
<p>　　And in fact, forgetting the past was easy to do in Indonesia. Jakarta was still a sleepybackwater in those days, with few buildings over four or five stories high, cyclerickshaws outnumbering cars, the city center and wealthier sections of town—with theircolonial elegance and lush, well-tended lawns—quickly giving way to clots of smallvillages with unpaved roads and open sewers, dusty markets, and shanties of mud andbrick and plywood and corrugated iron that tumbled down gentle banks to murky riverswhere families bathed and washed laundry like pilgrims in the Ganges.</p> 
<p>　　Our family was not well off in those early years; the Indonesian army didn’t pay itslieutenants much. We lived in a modest house on the outskirts of town, without air-conditioning, refrigeration, or flush toilets. We had no car—my stepfather rode amotorcycle, while my mother took the local jitney service every morning to the U.S.</p> 
<p>　　embassy, where she worked as an English teacher. Without the money to go to theinternational school that most expatriate children attended, I went to local Indonesianschools and ran the streets with the children of farmers, servants, tailors, and clerks.</p> 
<p>　　As a boy of seven or eight, none of this concerned me much. I remember those years asa joyous time, full of adventure and mystery—days of chasing down chickens andrunning from water buffalo, nights of shadow puppets and ghost stories and streetvendors bringing delectable sweets to our door. As it was, I knew that relative to ourneighbors we were doing fine—unlike many, we always had enough to eat.</p> 
<p>　　And perhaps more than that, I understood, even at a young age, that my family’s statuswas determined not only by our wealth but by our ties to the West. My mother mightscowl at the attitudes she heard from other Americans in Jakarta, their condescensiontoward Indonesians, their unwillingness to learn anything about the country that washosting them—but given the exchange rate, she was glad to be getting paid in dollarsrather than the rupiahs her Indonesian colleagues at the embassy were paid. We mightlive as Indonesians lived—but every so often my mother would take me to theAmerican Club, where I could jump in the pool and watch cartoons and sip Coca-Colato my heart’s content. Sometimes, when my Indonesian friends came to our house, Iwould show them books of photographs, of Disneyland or the Empire State Building,that my grandmother had sent me; sometimes we would thumb through the SearsRoebuck catalog and marvel at the treasures on display. All this, I knew, was part of myheritage and set me apart, for my mother and I were citizens of the United States,beneficiaries of its power, safe and secure under the blanket of its protection.</p> 
<p>　　The scope of that power was hard to miss. The U.S. military conducted joint exerciseswith the Indonesian military and training programs for its officers. President Suhartoturned to a cadre of American economists to design Indonesia’s development plan,based on free-market principles and foreign investment. American developmentconsultants formed a steady line outside government ministries, helping to manage themassive influx of foreign assistance from the U.S. Agency for InternationalDevelopment and the World Bank. And although corruption permeated every level ofgovernment—even the smallest interaction with a policeman or bureaucrat involved abribe, and just about every commodity or product coming in and out of the country,from oil to wheat to automobiles, went through companies controlled by the president,his family, or members of the ruling junta—enough of the oil wealth and foreign aidwas plowed back into schools, roads, and other infrastructure that Indonesia’s generalpopulation saw its living standards rise dramatically; between 1967 and 1997, per capitaincome would go from $50 to $4,600 a year. As far as the United States was concerned,Indonesia had become a model of stability, a reliable supplier of raw materials andimporter of Western goods, a stalwart ally and bulwark against communism.</p> 
<p>　　I would stay in Indonesia long enough to see some of this newfound prosperityfirsthand. Released from the army, my stepfather began working for an American oilcompany. We moved to a bigger house and got a car and a driver, a refrigerator, and atelevision set. But in 1971 my mother—concerned for my education and perhapsanticipating her own growing distance from my stepfather—sent me to live with mygrandparents in Hawaii. A year later she and my sister would join me. My mother’s tiesto Indonesia would never diminish; for the next twenty years she would travel back andforth, working for international agencies for six or twelve months at a time as aspecialist in women’s development issues, designing programs to help village womenstart their own businesses or bring their produce to market. But while during my teenageyears I would return to Indonesia three or four times on short visits, my life andattention gradually turned elsewhere.</p> 
<p>　　What I know of Indonesia’s subsequent history, then, I know mainly through books,newspapers, and the stories my mother told me. For twenty-five years, in fits and starts,Indonesia’s economy continued to grow. Jakarta became a metropolis of almost ninemillion souls, with skyscrapers, slums, smog, and nightmare traffic. Men and womenleft the countryside to join the ranks of wage labor in manufacturing plants built byforeign investment, making sneakers for Nike and shirts for the Gap. Bali became theresort of choice for surfers and rock stars, with five-star hotels, Internet connections,and a Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise. By the early nineties, Indonesia wasconsidered an “Asian tiger,” the next great success story of a globalizing world.</p> 
<p>　　Even the darker aspects of Indonesian life—its politics and human rights record—showed signs of improvement. When it came to sheer brutality, the post-1967 Suhartoregime never reached the levels of Iraq under Saddam Hussein; with his subdued, placidstyle, the Indonesian president would never attract the attention that more demonstrativestrongmen like Pinochet or the Shah of Iran did. By any measure, though, Suharto’s rulewas harshly repressive. Arrests and torture of dissidents were common, a free pressnonexistent, elections a mere formality. When ethnically based secessionist movementssprang up in areas like Aceh, the army targeted not just guerrillas but civilians for swiftretribution—murder, rape, villages set afire. And throughout the seventies and eighties,all this was done with the knowledge, if not outright approval, of U.S. administrations.</p> 
<p>　　But with the end of the Cold War, Washington’s attitudes began to change. The StateDepartment began pressuring Indonesia to curb its human rights abuses. In 1992, afterIndonesian military units massacred peaceful demonstrators in Dili, East Timor,Congress terminated military aid to the Indonesian government. By 1996, Indonesianreformists had begun taking to the streets, openly talking about corruption in highoffices, the military’s excesses, and the need for free and fair elections.</p> 
<p>　　Then, in 1997, the bottom fell out. A run on currencies and securities throughout Asiaengulfed an Indonesian economy already corroded by decades of corruption. Therupiah’s value fell 85 percent in a matter of months. Indonesian companies that hadborrowed in dollars saw their balance sheets collapse. In exchange for a $43 billionbailout, the Western-dominated International Monetary Fund, or IMF, insisted on aseries of austerity measures (cutting government subsidies, raising interest rates) thatwould lead the price of such staples as rice and kerosene to nearly double. By the timethe crisis was over, Indonesia’s economy had contracted almost 14 percent. Riots anddemonstrations grew so severe that Suharto was finally forced to resign, and in 1998 thecountry’s first free elections were held, with some forty-eight parties vying for seats andsome ninety-three million people casting their votes.</p> 
<p>　　On the surface, at least, Indonesia has survived the twin shocks of financial meltdownand democratization. The stock market is booming, and a second national election wentoff without major incident, leading to a peaceful transfer of power. If corruptionremains endemic and the military remains a potent force, there’s been an explosion ofindependent newspapers and political parties to channel discontent.</p> 
<p>　　On the other hand, democracy hasn’t brought a return to prosperity. Per capita income isnearly 22 percent less than it was in 1997. The gap between rich and poor, alwayscavernous, appears to have worsened. The average Indonesian’s sense of deprivation isamplified by the Internet and satellite TV, which beam in images of the unattainableriches of London, New York, Hong Kong, and Paris in exquisite detail. And anti-American sentiment, almost nonexistent during the Suharto years, is now widespread,thanks in part to perceptions that New York speculators and the IMF purposelytriggered the Asian financial crisis. In a 2003 poll, most Indonesians had a higheropinion of Osama bin Laden than they did of George W. Bush.</p> 
<p>　　All of which underscores perhaps the most profound shift in Indonesia—the growth ofmilitant, fundamentalist Islam in the country. Traditionally, Indonesians practiced atolerant, almost syncretic brand of the faith, infused with the Buddhist, Hindu, andanimist traditions of earlier periods. Under the watchful eye of an explicitly secularSuharto government, alcohol was permitted, non-Muslims practiced their faith free frompersecution, and women—sporting skirts or sarongs as they rode buses or scooters onthe way to work—possessed all the rights that men possessed. Today, Islamic partiesmake up one of the largest political blocs, with many calling for the imposition ofsharia, or Islamic law. Seeded by funds from the Middle East, Wahhabist clerics,schools, and mosques now dot the countryside. Many Indonesian women have adoptedthe head coverings so familiar in the Muslim countries of North Africa and the PersianGulf; Islamic militants and self-proclaimed “vice squads” have attacked churches,nightclubs, casinos, and brothels. In 2002, an explosion in a Bali nightclub killed morethan two hundred people; similar suicide bombings followed in Jakarta in 2004 and Baliin 2005. Members of Jemaah Islamiah, a militant Islamic organization with links to AlQaeda, were tried for the bombings; while three of those connected to the bombingsreceived death sentences, the spiritual leader of the group, Abu Bakar Bashir, wasreleased after a twenty-six-month prison term.</p> 
<p>　　It was on a beach just a few miles from the site of those bombings that I stayed the lasttime I visited Bali. When I think of that island, and all of Indonesia, I’m haunted bymemories—the feel of packed mud under bare feet as I wander through paddy fields;the sight of day breaking behind volcanic peaks; the muezzin’s call at night and thesmell of wood smoke; the dickering at the fruit stands alongside the road; the frenziedsound of a gamelan orchestra, the musicians’ faces lit by fire. I would like to takeMichelle and the girls to share that piece of my life, to climb the thousand-year-oldHindu ruins of Prambanan or swim in a river high in Balinese hills.</p> 
<p>　　But my plans for such a trip keep getting delayed. I’m chronically busy, and travelingwith young children is always difficult. And, too, perhaps I am worried about what Iwill find there—that the land of my childhood will no longer match my memories. Asmuch as the world has shrunk, with its direct flights and cell phone coverage and CNNand Internet cafés, Indonesia feels more distant now than it did thirty years ago.</p> 
<p>　　I fear it’s becoming a land of strangers.</p> 
<p>　　IN THE FIELD of international affairs, it’s dangerous to extrapolate from theexperiences of a single country. In its history, geography, culture, and conflicts, eachnation is unique. And yet in many ways Indonesia serves as a useful metaphor for theworld beyond our borders—a world in which globalization and sectarianism, povertyand plenty, modernity and antiquity constantly collide.</p> 
<p>　　Indonesia also provides a handy record of U.S. foreign policy over the past fifty years.</p> 
<p>　　In broad outline at least, it’s all there: our role in liberating former colonies and creatinginternational institutions to help manage the post–World War II order; our tendency toview nations and conflicts through the prism of the Cold War; our tireless promotion ofAmerican-style capitalism and multinational corporations; the tolerance and occasionalencouragement of tyranny, corruption, and environmental degradation when it servedour interests; our optimism once the Cold War ended that Big Macs and the Internetwould lead to the end of historical conflicts; the growing economic power of Asia andthe growing resentment of the United States as the world’s sole superpower; therealization that in the short term, at least, democratization might lay bare, rather thanalleviate, ethnic hatreds and religious divisions—and that the wonders of globalizationmight also facilitate economic volatility, the spread of pandemics, and terrorism.</p> 
<p>　　In other words, our record is mixed—not just in Indonesia but across the globe. Attimes, American foreign policy has been farsighted, simultaneously serving our nationalinterests, our ideals, and the interests of other nations. At other times American policieshave been misguided, based on false assumptions that ignore the legitimate aspirationsof other peoples, undermine our own credibility, and make for a more dangerous world.</p> 
<p>　　Such ambiguity shouldn’t be surprising, for American foreign policy has always been ajumble of warring impulses. In the earliest days of the Republic, a policy of isolationismoften prevailed—a wariness of foreign intrigues that befitted a nation just emergingfrom a war of independence. “Why,” George Washington asked in his famous FarewellAddress, “by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle ourpeace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor orcaprice?” Washington’s view was reinforced by what he called America’s “detachedand distant situation,” a geographic separation that would permit the new nation to“defy material injury from external annoyance.”</p> 
<p>　　Moreover, while America’s revolutionary origins and republican form of governmentmight make it sympathetic toward those seeking freedom elsewhere, America’s earlyleaders cautioned against idealistic attempts to export our way of life; according to JohnQuincy Adams, America should not go “abroad in search of monsters to destroy” nor“become the dictatress of the world.” Providence had charged America with the task ofmaking a new world, not reforming the old; protected by an ocean and with the bountyof a continent, America could best serve the cause of freedom by concentrating on itsown development, becoming a beacon of hope for other nations and people around theglobe.</p> 
<p>　　But if suspicion of foreign entanglements is stamped into our DNA, then so is theimpulse to expand—geographically, commercially, and ideologically. Thomas Jeffersonexpressed early on the inevitability of expansion beyond the boundaries of the originalthirteen states, and his timetable for such expansion was greatly accelerated with theLouisiana Purchase and the Lewis and Clark expedition. The same John Quincy Adamswho warned against U.S. adventurism abroad became a tireless advocate of continentalexpansion and served as the chief architect of the Monroe Doctrine—a warning toEuropean powers to keep out of the Western Hemisphere. As American soldiers andsettlers moved steadily west and southwest, successive administrations described theannexation of territory in terms of “manifest destiny”—the conviction that suchexpansion was preordained, part of God’s plan to extend what Andrew Jackson called“the area of freedom” across the continent.</p> 
<p>　　Of course, manifest destiny also meant bloody and violent conquest—of NativeAmerican tribes forcibly removed from their lands and of the Mexican army defendingits territory. It was a conquest that, like slavery, contradicted America’s foundingprinciples and tended to be justified in explicitly racist terms, a conquest that Americanmythology has always had difficulty fully absorbing but that other countries recognizedfor what it was—an exercise in raw power.</p> 
<p>　　With the end of the Civil War and the consolidation of what’s now the continentalUnited States, that power could not be denied. Intent on expanding markets for itsgoods, securing raw materials for its industry, and keeping sea lanes open for itscommerce, the nation turned its attention overseas. Hawaii was annexed, givingAmerica a foothold in the Pacific. The Spanish-American War delivered Puerto Rico,Guam, and the Philippines into U.S. control; when some members of the Senateobjected to the military occupation of an archipelago seven thousand miles away—anoccupation that would involve thousands of U.S. troops crushing a Philippineindependence movement—one senator argued that the acquisition would provide theUnited States with access to the China market and mean “a vast trade and wealth andpower.” America would never pursue the systematic colonization practiced by Europeannations, but it shed all inhibitions about meddling in the affairs of countries it deemedstrategically important. Theodore Roosevelt, for example, added a corollary to theMonroe Doctrine, declaring that the United States would intervene in any LatinAmerican or Caribbean country whose government it deemed not to America’s liking.</p> 
<p>　　“The United States of America has not the option as to whether it will or it will not playa great part in the world,” Roosevelt would argue. “It must play a great part. All that itcan decide is whether it will play that part well or badly.”</p> 
<p>　　By the start of the twentieth century, then, the motives that drove U.S. foreign policyseemed barely distinguishable from those of the other great powers, driven byrealpolitik and commercial interests. Isolationist sentiment in the population at largeremained strong, particularly when it came to conflicts in Europe, and when vital U.S.</p> 
<p>　　interests did not seem directly at stake. But technology and trade were shrinking theglobe; determining which interests were vital and which ones were not becameincreasingly difficult. During World War I, Woodrow Wilson avoided Americaninvolvement until the repeated sinking of American vessels by German U-boats and theimminent collapse of the European continent made neutrality untenable. When the warwas over, America had emerged as the world’s dominant power—but a power whoseprosperity Wilson now understood to be linked to peace and prosperity in farawaylands.</p> 
<p>　　It was in an effort to address this new reality that Wilson sought to reinterpret the ideaof America’s manifest destiny. Making “the world safe for democracy” didn’t justinvolve winning a war, he argued; it was in America’s interest to encourage the self-determination of all peoples and provide the world a legal framework that could helpavoid future conflicts. As part of the Treaty of Versailles, which detailed the terms ofGerman surrender, Wilson proposed a League of Nations to mediate conflicts betweennations, along with an international court and a set of international laws that would bindnot just the weak but also the strong. “This is the time of all others when Democracyshould prove its purity and its spiritual power to prevail,” Wilson said. “It is surely themanifest destiny of the United States to lead in the attempt to make this spirit prevail.”</p> 
<p>　　Wilson’s proposals were initially greeted with enthusiasm in the United States andaround the world. The U.S. Senate, however, was less impressed. Republican SenateLeader Henry Cabot Lodge considered the League of Nations—and the very concept ofinternational law—as an encroachment on American sovereignty, a foolish constraint onAmerica’s ability to impose its will around the world. Aided by traditional isolationistsin both parties (many of whom had opposed American entry into World War I), as wellas Wilson’s stubborn unwillingness to compromise, the Senate refused to ratify U.S.</p> 
<p>　　membership in the League.</p> 
<p>　　For the next twenty years, America turned resolutely inward—reducing its army andnavy, refusing to join the World Court, standing idly by as Italy, Japan, and NaziGermany built up their military machines. The Senate became a hotbed of isolationism,passing a Neutrality Act that prevented the United States from lending assistance tocountries invaded by the Axis powers, and repeatedly ignoring the President’s appealsas Hitler’s armies marched across Europe. Not until the bombing of Pearl Harbor wouldAmerica realize its terrible mistake. “There is no such thing as security for any nation—or any individual—in a world ruled by the principles of gangsterism,” FDR would sayin his national address after the attack. “We cannot measure our safety in terms of mileson any map any more.”</p> 
<p>　　In the aftermath of World War II, the United States would have a chance to apply theselessons to its foreign policy. With Europe and Japan in ruins, the Soviet Union bledwhite by its battles on the Eastern Front but already signaling its intentions to spread itsbrand of totalitarian communism as far as it could, America faced a choice. There werethose on the right who argued that only a unilateral foreign policy and an immediateinvasion of the Soviet Union could disable the emerging communist threat. Andalthough isolationism of the sort that prevailed in the thirties was now thoroughlydiscredited, there were those on the left who downplayed Soviet aggression, arguingthat given Soviet losses and the country’s critical role in the Allied victory, Stalinshould be accommodated.</p> 
<p>　　America took neither path. Instead, the postwar leadership of President Truman, DeanAcheson, George Marshall, and George Kennan crafted the architecture of a new,postwar order that married Wilson’s idealism to hardheaded realism, an acceptance ofAmerica’s power with a humility regarding America’s ability to control events aroundthe world. Yes, these men argued, the world is a dangerous place, and the Soviet threatis real; America needed to maintain its military dominance and be prepared to use forcein defense of its interests across the globe. But even the power of the United States wasfinite—and because the battle against communism was also a battle of ideas, a test ofwhat system might best serve the hopes and dreams of billions of people around theworld, military might alone could not ensure America’s long-term prosperity orsecurity.</p> 
<p>　　What America needed, then, were stable allies—allies that shared the ideals of freedom,democracy, and the rule of law, and that saw themselves as having a stake in a market-based economic system. Such alliances, both military and economic, entered into freelyand maintained by mutual consent, would be more lasting—and stir less resentment—than any collection of vassal states American imperialism might secure. Likewise, itwas in America’s interest to work with other countries to build up internationalinstitutions and promote international norms. Not because of a naive assumption thatinternational laws and treaties alone would end conflicts among nations or eliminate theneed for American military action, but because the more international norms werereinforced and the more America signaled a willingness to show restraint in the exerciseof its power, the fewer the number of conflicts that would arise—and the morelegitimate our actions would appear in the eyes of the world when we did have to movemilitarily.</p> 
<p>　　In less than a decade, the infrastructure of a new world order was in place. There was aU.S. policy of containment with respect to communist expansion, backed not just byU.S. troops but also by security agreements with NATO and Japan; the Marshall Plan torebuild war-shattered economies; the Bretton Woods agreement to provide stability tothe world’s financial markets and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade toestablish rules governing world commerce; U.S. support for the independence of formerEuropean colonies; the IMF and World Bank to help integrate these newly independentnations into the world economy; and the United Nations to provide a forum forcollective security and international cooperation.</p> 
<p>　　Sixty years later, we can see the results of this massive postwar undertaking: asuccessful outcome to the Cold War, an avoidance of nuclear catastrophe, the effectiveend of conflict between the world’s great military powers, and an era of unprecedentedeconomic growth at home and abroad.</p> 
<p>　　It’s a remarkable achievement, perhaps the Greatest Generation’s greatest gift to us afterthe victory over fascism. But like any system built by man, it had its flaws andcontradictions; it could fall victim to the distortions of politics, the sins of hubris, thecorrupting effects of fear. Because of the enormity of the Soviet threat, and the shock ofcommunist takeovers in China and North Korea, American policy makers came to viewnationalist movements, ethnic struggles, reform efforts, or left-leaning policiesanywhere in the world through the lens of the Cold War—potential threats they feltoutweighed our professed commitment to freedom and democracy. For decades wewould tolerate and even aid thieves like Mobutu, thugs like Noriega, so long as theyopposed communism. Occasionally U.S. covert operations would engineer the removalof democratically elected leaders in countries like Iran—with seismic repercussions thathaunt us to this day.</p> 
<p>　　America’s policy of containment also involved an enormous military buildup, matchingand then exceeding the Soviet and Chinese arsenals. Over time, the “iron triangle” ofthe Pentagon, defense contractors, and congressmen with large defense expenditures intheir districts amassed great power in shaping U.S. foreign policy. And although thethreat of nuclear war would preclude direct military confrontation with our superpowerrivals, U.S policy makers increasingly viewed problems elsewhere in the world througha military lens rather than a diplomatic one.</p> 
<p>　　Most important, the postwar system over time suffered from too much politics and notenough deliberation and domestic consensus building. One of America’s strengthsimmediately following the war was a degree of domestic consensus surrounding foreignpolicy. There might have been fierce differences between Republicans and Democrats,but politics usually ended at the water’s edge; professionals, whether in the WhiteHouse, the Pentagon, the State Department, or the CIA, were expected to makedecisions based on facts and sound judgment, not ideology or electioneering. Moreover,that consensus extended to the public at large; programs like the Marshall Plan, whichinvolved a massive investment of U.S. funds, could not have gone forward without theAmerican people’s basic trust in their government, as well as a reciprocal faith on thepart of government officials that the American people could be trusted with the factsthat went into decisions that spent their tax dollars or sent their sons to war.</p> 
<p>　　As the Cold War wore on, the key elements in this consensus began to erode. Politiciansdiscovered that they could get votes by being tougher on communism than theiropponents. Democrats were assailed for “losing China.” McCarthyism destroyed careersand crushed dissent. Kennedy would blame Republicans for a “missile gap” that didn’texist on his way to beating Nixon, who himself had made a career of Red-baiting hisopponents. Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson would all find their judgmentclouded by fear that they would be tagged as “soft on communism.” The Cold Wartechniques of secrecy, snooping, and misinformation, used against foreign governmentsand foreign populations, became tools of domestic politics, a means to harass critics,build support for questionable policies, or cover up blunders. The very ideals that wehad promised to export overseas were being betrayed at home.</p> 
<p>　　All these trends came to a head in Vietnam. The disastrous consequences of thatconflict—for our credibility and prestige abroad, for our armed forces (which wouldtake a generation to recover), and most of all for those who fought—have been amplydocumented. But perhaps the biggest casualty of that war was the bond of trust betweenthe American people and their government—and between Americans themselves. As aconsequence of a more aggressive press corps and the images of body bags floodinginto living rooms, Americans began to realize that the best and the brightest inWashington didn’t always know what they were doing—and didn’t always tell the truth.</p> 
<p>　　Increasingly, many on the left voiced opposition not only to the Vietnam War but alsoto the broader aims of American foreign policy. In their view, President Johnson,General Westmoreland, the CIA, the “military-industrial complex,” and internationalinstitutions like the World Bank were all manifestations of American arrogance,jingoism, racism, capitalism, and imperialism. Those on the right responded in kind,laying responsibility not only for the loss of Vietnam but also for the decline ofAmerica’s standing in the world squarely on the “blame America first” crowd—theprotesters, the hippies, Jane Fonda, the Ivy League intellectuals and liberal media whodenigrated patriotism, embraced a relativistic worldview, and undermined Americanresolve to confront godless communism.</p> 
<p>　　Admittedly, these were caricatures, promoted by activists and political consultants.</p> 
<p>　　Many Americans remained somewhere in the middle, still supportive of America’sefforts to defeat communism but skeptical of U.S. policies that might involve largenumbers of American casualties. Throughout the seventies and eighties, one could findDemocratic hawks and Republican doves; in Congress, there were men like MarkHatfield of Oregon and Sam Nunn of Georgia who sought to perpetuate the tradition ofa bipartisan foreign policy. But the caricatures were what shaped public impressionsduring election time, as Republicans increasingly portrayed Democrats as weak ondefense, and those suspicious of military and covert action abroad increasingly made theDemocratic Party their political home.</p> 
<p>　　It was against this backdrop—an era of division rather than an era of consensus—thatmost Americans alive today formed whatever views they may have on foreign policy.</p> 
<p>　　These were the years of Nixon and Kissinger, whose foreign policies were tacticallybrilliant but were overshadowed by domestic policies and a Cambodian bombingcampaign that were morally rudderless. They were the years of Jimmy Carter, aDemocrat who—with his emphasis on human rights—seemed prepared to once againalign moral concerns with a strong defense, until oil shocks, the humiliation of theIranian hostage crisis, and the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan made him seemnaive and ineffective.</p> 
<p>　　Looming perhaps largest of all was Ronald Reagan, whose clarity about communismseemed matched by his blindness regarding other sources of misery in the world. Ipersonally came of age during the Reagan presidency—I was studying internationalaffairs at Columbia, and later working as a community organizer in Chicago—and likemany Democrats in those days I bemoaned the effect of Reagan’s policies toward theThird World: his administration’s support for the apartheid regime of South Africa, thefunding of El Salvador’s death squads, the invasion of tiny, hapless Grenada. The moreI studied nuclear arms policy, the more I found Star Wars to be ill conceived; the chasmbetween Reagan’s soaring rhetoric and the tawdry Iran-Contra deal left me speechless.</p> 
<p>　　But at times, in arguments with some of my friends on the left, I would find myself inthe curious position of defending aspects of Reagan’s worldview. I didn’t understandwhy, for example, progressives should be less concerned about oppression behind theIron Curtain than they were about brutality in Chile. I couldn’t be persuaded that U.S.</p> 
<p>　　multinationals and international terms of trade were single-handedly responsible forpoverty around the world; nobody forced corrupt leaders in Third World countries tosteal from their people. I might have arguments with the size of Reagan’s militarybuildup, but given the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, staying ahead of the Sovietsmilitarily seemed a sensible thing to do. Pride in our country, respect for our armedservices, a healthy appreciation for the dangers beyond our borders, an insistence thatthere was no easy equivalence between East and West—in all this I had no quarrel withReagan. And when the Berlin Wall came tumbling down, I had to give the old man hisdue, even if I never gave him my vote.</p> 
<p>　　Many people—including many Democrats—did give Reagan their vote, leadingRepublicans to argue that his presidency restored America’s foreign policy consensus.</p> 
<p>　　Of course, that consensus was never really tested; Reagan’s war against communismwas mainly carried out through proxies and deficit spending, not the deployment of U.S.</p> 
<p>　　troops. As it was, the end of the Cold War made Reagan’s formula seem ill suited to anew world. George H. W. Bush’s return to a more traditional, “realist” foreign policywould result in a steady management of the Soviet Union’s dissolution and an ablehandling of the first Gulf War. But with the American public’s attention focused on thedomestic economy, his skill in building international coalitions or judiciously projectingAmerican power did nothing to salvage his presidency.</p> 
<p>　　By the time Bill Clinton came into office, conventional wisdom suggested thatAmerica’s post–Cold War foreign policy would be more a matter of trade than tanks,protecting American copyrights rather than American lives. Clinton himself understoodthat globalization involved not only new economic challenges but also new securitychallenges. In addition to promoting free trade and bolstering the international financialsystem, his administration would work to end long-festering conflicts in the Balkansand Northern Ireland and advance democratization in Eastern Europe, Latin America,Africa, and the former Soviet Union. But in the eyes of the public, at least, foreignpolicy in the nineties lacked any overarching theme or grand imperatives. U.S. militaryaction in particular seemed entirely a matter of choice, not necessity—the product of ourdesire to slap down rogue states, perhaps; or a function of humanitarian calculationsregarding the moral obligations we owed to Somalis, Haitians, Bosnians, or otherunlucky souls.</p> 
<p>　　Then came September 11—and Americans felt their world turned upside down.</p> 
<p>　　IN JANUARY 2006, I boarded a C-130 military cargo plane and took off for my firsttrip into Iraq. Two of my colleagues on the trip—Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana andCongressman Harold Ford, Jr. of Tennessee—had made the trip before, and theywarned me that the landings in Baghdad could be a bit uncomfortable: To evadepotential hostile fire, military flights in and out of Iraq’s capital city engaged in a seriesof sometimes stomach-turning maneuvers. As our plane cruised through the hazymorning, though, it was hard to feel concerned. Strapped into canvas seats, most of myfellow passengers had fallen asleep, their heads bobbing against the orange webbingthat ran down the center of the fuselage. One of the crew appeared to be playing a videogame; another placidly thumbed through our flight plans.</p> 
<p>　　It had been four and a half years since I’d first heard reports of a plane hitting the WorldTrade Center. I had been in Chicago at the time, driving to a state legislative hearingdowntown. The reports on my car radio were sketchy, and I assumed that there musthave been an accident, a small prop plane perhaps veering off course. By the time Iarrived at my meeting, the second plane had already hit, and we were told to evacuatethe State of Illinois Building. Up and down the streets, people gathered, staring at thesky and at the Sears Tower. Later, in my law office, a group of us sat motionless as thenightmare images unfolded across the TV screen—a plane, dark as a shadow, vanishinginto glass and steel; men and women clinging to windowsills, then letting go; the shoutsand sobs from below and finally the rolling clouds of dust blotting out the sun.</p> 
<p>　　I spent the next several weeks as most Americans did—calling friends in New York andD.C., sending donations, listening to the President’s speech, mourning the dead. And forme, as for most of us, the effect of September 11 felt profoundly personal. It wasn’t justthe magnitude of the destruction that affected me, or the memories of the five years I’dspent in New York—memories of streets and sights now reduced to rubble. Rather, itwas the intimacy of imagining those ordinary acts that 9/11’s victims must haveperformed in the hours before they were killed, the daily routines that constitute life inour modern world—the boarding of a plane, the jostling as we exit a commuter train,grabbing coffee and the morning paper at a newsstand, making small talk on theelevator. For most Americans, such routines represented a victory of order over chaos,the concrete expression of our belief that so long as we exercised, wore seat belts, had ajob with benefits, and avoided certain neighborhoods, our safety was ensured, ourfamilies protected.</p> 
<p>　　Now chaos had come to our doorstep. As a consequence, we would have to actdifferently, understand the world differently. We would have to answer the call of anation. Within a week of the attacks, I watched the Senate vote 98–0 and the House vote420–1 to give the President the authority to “use all necessary and appropriate forceagainst those nations, organizations or persons” behind the attacks. Interest in the armedservices and applications to join the CIA soared, as young people across Americaresolved to serve their country. Nor were we alone. In Paris, Le Monde ran the bannerheadline “Nous sommes tous Américains” (“We are all Americans”). In Cairo, localmosques offered prayers of sympathy. For the first time since its founding in 1949,NATO invoked Article 5 of its charter, agreeing that the armed attack on one of itsmembers “shall be considered an attack against them all.” With justice at our backs andthe world by our side, we drove the Taliban government out of Kabul in just over amonth; Al Qaeda operatives fled or were captured or killed.</p> 
<p>　　It was a good start by the Administration, I thought—steady, measured, andaccomplished with minimal casualties (only later would we discover the degree towhich our failure to put sufficient military pressure on Al Qaeda forces at Tora Boramay have led to bin Laden’s escape). And so, along with the rest of the world, I waitedwith anticipation for what I assumed would follow: the enunciation of a U.S. foreignpolicy for the twenty-first century, one that would not only adapt our military planning,intelligence operations, and homeland defenses to the threat of terrorist networks butbuild a new international consensus around the challenges of transnational threats.</p> 
<p>　　This new blueprint never arrived. Instead what we got was an assortment of outdatedpolicies from eras gone by, dusted off, slapped together, and with new labels affixed.</p> 
<p>　　Reagan’s “Evil Empire” was now “the Axis of Evil.” Theodore Roosevelt’s version ofthe Monroe Doctrine—the notion that we could preemptively remove governments notto our liking—was now the Bush Doctrine, only extended beyond the WesternHemisphere to span the globe. Manifest destiny was back in fashion; all that wasneeded, according to Bush, was American firepower, American resolve, and a “coalitionof the willing.”</p> 
<p>　　Perhaps worst of all, the Bush Administration resuscitated a brand of politics not seensince the end of the Cold War. As the ouster of Saddam Hussein became the test casefor Bush’s doctrine of preventive war, those who questioned the Administration’srationale for invasion were accused of being “soft on terrorism” or “un-American.”</p> 
<p>　　Instead of an honest accounting of this military campaign’s pros and cons, theAdministration initiated a public relations offensive: shading intelligence reports tosupport its case, grossly understating both the costs and the manpower requirements ofmilitary action, raising the specter of mushroom clouds.</p> 
<p>　　The PR strategy worked; by the fall of 2002, a majority of Americans were convincedthat Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, and at least 66 percentbelieved (falsely) that the Iraqi leader had been personally involved in the 9/11 attacks.</p> 
<p>　　Support for an invasion of Iraq—and Bush’s approval rating—hovered around 60percent. With an eye on the midterm elections, Republicans stepped up the attacks andpushed for a vote authorizing the use of force against Saddam Hussein. And on October11, 2002, twenty-eight of the Senate’s fifty Democrats joined all but one Republican inhanding to Bush the power he wanted.</p> 
<p>　　I was disappointed in that vote, although sympathetic to the pressures Democrats wereunder. I had felt some of those same pressures myself. By the fall of 2002, I had alreadydecided to run for the U.S. Senate and knew that possible war with Iraq would loomlarge in any campaign. When a group of Chicago activists asked if I would speak at alarge antiwar rally planned for October, a number of my friends warned me againsttaking so public a position on such a volatile issue. Not only was the idea of an invasionincreasingly popular, but on the merits I didn’t consider the case against war to be cut-and-dried. Like most analysts, I assumed that Saddam had chemical and biologicalweapons and coveted nuclear arms. I believed that he had repeatedly flouted UNresolutions and weapons inspectors and that such behavior had to have consequences.</p> 
<p>　　That Saddam butchered his own people was undisputed; I had no doubt that the world,and the Iraqi people, would be better off without him.</p> 
<p>　　What I sensed, though, was that the threat Saddam posed was not imminent, theAdministration’s rationales for war were flimsy and ideologically driven, and the war inAfghanistan was far from complete. And I was certain that by choosing precipitous,unilateral military action over the hard slog of diplomacy, coercive inspections, andsmart sanctions, America was missing an opportunity to build a broad base of supportfor its policies.</p> 
<p>　　And so I made the speech. To the two thousand people gathered in Chicago’s FederalPlaza, I explained that unlike some of the people in the crowd, I didn’t oppose allwars—that my grandfather had signed up for the war the day after Pearl Harbor wasbombed and had fought in Patton’s army. I also said that “after witnessing the carnageand destruction, the dust and the tears, I supported this Administration’s pledge to huntdown and root out those who would slaughter innocents in the name of intolerance” andwould “willingly take up arms myself to prevent such tragedy from happening again.”</p> 
<p>　　What I could not support was “a dumb war, a rash war, a war based not on reason buton passion, not on principle but on politics.” And I said:</p> 
<p>　　I know that even a successful war against Iraq will require a U.S. occupation ofundetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences. I knowthat an invasion of Iraq without a clear rationale and without strong internationalsupport will only fan the flames of the Middle East, and encourage the worst, ratherthan the best, impulses of the Arab world, and strengthen the recruitment arm of AlQaeda.</p> 
<p>　　The speech was well received; activists began circulating the text on the Internet, and Iestablished a reputation for speaking my mind on hard issues—a reputation that wouldcarry me through a tough Democratic primary. But I had no way of knowing at the timewhether my assessment of the situation in Iraq was correct. When the invasion wasfinally launched and U.S. forces marched unimpeded through Baghdad, when I sawSaddam’s statue topple and watched the President stand atop the U.S.S. AbrahamLincoln, a banner behind him proclaiming “Mission Accomplished,” I began to suspectthat I might have been wrong—and was relieved to see the low number of Americancasualties involved.</p> 
<p>　　And now, three years later—as the number of American deaths passed two thousandand the number of wounded passed sixteen thousand; after $250 billion in directspending and hundreds of billions more in future years to pay off the resulting debt andcare for disabled veterans; after two Iraqi national elections, one Iraqi constitutionalreferendum, and tens of thousands of Iraqi deaths; after watching anti-Americansentiment rise to record levels around the world and Afghanistan begin to slip back intochaos—I was flying into Baghdad as a member of the Senate, partially responsible fortrying to figure out just what to do with this mess.</p> 
<p>　　The landing at Baghdad International Airport turned out not to be so bad—although Iwas thankful that we couldn’t see out the windows as the C-130 bucked and banked anddipped its way down. Our escort officer from the State Department was there to greetus, along with an assortment of military personnel with rifles slung over their shoulders.</p> 
<p>　　After getting our security briefing, recording our blood types, and being fitted forhelmets and Kevlar vests, we boarded two Black Hawk helicopters and headed for theGreen Zone, flying low, passing over miles of mostly muddy, barren fields crisscrossedby narrow roads and punctuated by small groves of date trees and squat concreteshelters, many of them seemingly empty, some bulldozed down to their foundations.</p> 
<p>　　Eventually Baghdad came into view, a sand-colored metropolis set in a circular pattern,the Tigris River cutting a broad, murky swath down its center. Even from the air the citylooked worn and battered, the traffic on the streets intermittent—although almost everyrooftop was cluttered with satellite dishes, which along with cell phone service had beentouted by U.S. officials as one of the successes of the reconstruction.</p> 
<p>　　I would spend only a day and a half in Iraq, most of it in the Green Zone, a ten-mile-wide area of central Baghdad that had once been the heart of Saddam Hussein’sgovernment but was now a U.S.-controlled compound, surrounded along its perimeterby blast walls and barbed wire. Reconstruction teams briefed us about the difficulty ofmaintaining electrical power and oil production in the face of insurgent sabotage;intelligence officers described the growing threat of sectarian militias and theirinfiltration of Iraqi security forces. Later, we met with members of the Iraqi ElectionCommission, who spoke with enthusiasm about the high turnout during the recentelection, and for an hour we listened to U.S. Ambassador Khalilzad, a shrewd, elegantman with world-weary eyes, explain the delicate shuttle diplomacy in which he wasnow engaged, to bring Shi’ite, Sunni, and Kurdish factions into some sort of workableunity government.</p> 
<p>　　In the afternoon we had an opportunity to have lunch with some of the troops in thehuge mess hall just off the swimming pool of what had once been Saddam’s presidentialpalace. They were a mix of regular forces, reservists, and National Guard units, frombig cities and small towns, blacks and whites and Latinos, many of them on their secondor third tour of duty. They spoke with pride as they told us what their units hadaccomplished—building schools, protecting electrical facilities, leading newly trainedIraqi soldiers on patrol, maintaining supply lines to those in far-flung regions of thecountry. Again and again, I was asked the same question: Why did the U.S. press onlyreport on bombings and killings? There was progress being made, they insisted—Ineeded to let the folks back home know that their work was not in vain.</p> 
<p>　　It was easy, talking to these men and women, to understand their frustration, for all theAmericans I met in Iraq, whether military or civilian, impressed me with theirdedication, their skill, and their frank acknowledgment not only of the mistakes that hadbeen made but also of the difficulties of the task that still lay ahead. Indeed, the entireenterprise in Iraq bespoke American ingenuity, wealth, and technical know-how;standing inside the Green Zone or any of the large operating bases in Iraq and Kuwait,one could only marvel at the ability of our government to essentially erect entire citieswithin hostile territory, self-contained communities with their own power and sewagesystems, computer lines and wireless networks, basketball courts and ice cream stands.</p> 
<p>　　More than that, one was reminded of that unique quality of American optimism thateverywhere was on display—the absence of cynicism despite the danger, sacrifice, andseemingly interminable setbacks, the insistence that at the end of the day our actionswould result in a better life for a nation of people we barely knew.</p> 
<p>　　And yet, three conversations during the course of my visit would remind me of just howquixotic our efforts in Iraq still seemed—how, with all the American blood, treasure,and the best of intentions, the house we were building might be resting on quicksand.</p> 
<p>　　The first conversation took place in the early evening, when our delegation held a pressconference with a group of foreign correspondents stationed in Baghdad. After theQ&amp;A session, I asked the reporters if they’d stay for an informal, off-the-recordconversation. I was interested, I said, in getting some sense of life outside the GreenZone. They were happy to oblige, but insisted they could only stay for forty-fiveminutes—it was getting late, and like most residents of Baghdad, they generallyavoided traveling once the sun went down.</p> 
<p>　　As a group, they were young, mostly in their twenties and early thirties, all of themdressed casually enough that they could pass for college students. Their faces, though,showed the stresses they were under—sixty journalists had already been killed in Iraqby that time. Indeed, at the start of our conversation they apologized for beingsomewhat distracted; they had just received word that one of their colleagues, a reporterwith the Christian Science Monitor named Jill Carroll, had been abducted, her driverfound killed on the side of a road. Now they were all working their contacts, trying totrack down her whereabouts. Such violence wasn’t unusual in Baghdad these days, theysaid, although Iraqis overwhelmingly bore the brunt of it. Fighting between Shi’ites andSunnis had become widespread, less strategic, less comprehensible, more frightening.</p> 
<p>　　None of them thought that the elections would bring about significant improvement inthe security situation. I asked them if they thought a U.S. troop withdrawal might easetensions, expecting them to answer in the affirmative. Instead, they shook their heads.</p> 
<p>　　“My best guess is the country would collapse into civil war within weeks,” one of thereporters told me. “One hundred, maybe two hundred thousand dead. We’re the onlything holding this place together.”</p> 
<p>　　That night, our delegation accompanied Ambassador Khalilzad for dinner at the homeof Iraqi interim President Jalal Tala-bani. Security was tight as our convoy wound itsway past a maze of barricades out of the Green Zone; outside, our route was lined withU.S. troops at one-block intervals, and we were instructed to keep our vests and helmetson for the duration of the drive.</p> 
<p>　　After ten minutes we arrived at a large villa, where we were greeted by the presidentand several members of the Iraqi interim government. They were all heavyset men,most in their fifties or sixties, with broad smiles but eyes that betrayed no emotion. Irecognized only one of the ministers—Mr. Ahmed Chalabi, the Western-educatedShi’ite who, as a leader of the exile group the Iraqi National Congress, had reportedlyfed U.S. intelligence agencies and Bush policy makers some of the prewar informationon which the decision to invade was made—information for which Chalabi’s group hadreceived millions of dollars, and that had turned out to be bogus. Since then Chalabi hadfallen out with his U.S. patrons; there were reports that he had steered U.S. classifiedinformation to the Iranians, and that Jordan still had a warrant out for his arrest afterhe’d been convicted in absentia on thirty-one charges of embezzlement, theft, misuse ofdepositor funds, and currency speculation. But he appeared to have landed on his feet;immaculately dressed, accompanied by his grown daughter, he was now the interimgovernment’s acting oil minister.</p> 
<p>　　I didn’t speak much to Chalabi during dinner. Instead I was seated next to the formerinterim finance minister. He seemed impressive, speaking knowledgeably about Iraq’seconomy, its need to improve transparency and strengthen its legal framework to attractforeign investment. At the end of the evening, I mentioned my favorable impression toone of the embassy staff.</p> 
<p>　　“He’s smart, no doubt about it,” the staffer said. “Of course, he’s also one of the leadersof the SCIRI Party. They control the Ministry of the Interior, which controls the police.</p> 
<p>　　And the police, well…there have been problems with militia infiltration. Accusationsthat they’re grabbing Sunni leaders, bodies found the next morning, that kind ofthing…” The staffer’s voice trailed off, and he shrugged. “We work with what wehave.”</p> 
<p>　　I had difficulty sleeping that night; instead, I watched the Redskins game, piped in livevia satellite to the pool house once reserved for Saddam and his guests. Several times Imuted the TV and heard mortar fire pierce the silence. The following morning, we tooka Black Hawk to the Marine base in Fallujah, out in the arid, western portion of Iraqcalled Anbar Province. Some of the fiercest fighting against the insurgency had takenplace in Sunni-dominated Anbar, and the atmosphere in the camp was considerablygrimmer than in the Green Zone; just the previous day, five Marines on patrol had beenkilled by roadside bombs or small-arms fire. The troops here looked rawer as well, mostof them in their early twenties, many still with pimples and the unformed bodies ofteenagers.</p> 
<p>　　The general in charge of the camp had arranged a briefing, and we listened as thecamp’s senior officers explained the dilemma facing U.S. forces: With improvedcapabilities, they were arresting more and more insurgent leaders each day, but likestreet gangs back in Chicago, for every insurgent they arrested, there seemed to be twoready to take his place. Economics, and not just politics, seemed to be feeding theinsurgency—the central government had been neglecting Anbar, and maleunemployment hovered around 70 percent.</p> 
<p>　　“For two or three dollars, you can pay some kid to plant a bomb,” one of the officerssaid. “That’s a lot of money out here.”</p> 
<p>　　By the end of the briefing, a light fog had rolled in, delaying our flight to Kirkuk. Whilewaiting, my foreign policy staffer, Mark Lippert, wandered off to chat with one of theunit’s senior officers, while I struck up a conversation with one of the majorsresponsible for counterinsurgency strategy in the region. He was a soft-spoken man,short and with glasses; it was easy to imagine him as a high school math teacher. In fact,it turned out that before joining the Marines he had spent several years in thePhilippines as a member of the Peace Corps. Many of the lessons he had learned thereneeded to be applied to the military’s work in Iraq, he told me. He didn’t have anywherenear the number of Arabic-speakers needed to build trust with the local population. Weneeded to improve cultural sensitivity within U.S. forces, develop long-termrelationships with local leaders, and couple security forces to reconstruction teams, sothat Iraqis could see concrete benefits from U.S. efforts. All this would take time, hesaid, but he could already see changes for the better as the military adopted thesepractices throughout the country.</p> 
<p>　　Our escort officer signaled that the chopper was ready to take off. I wished the majorluck and headed for the van. Mark came up beside me, and I asked him what he’dlearned from his conversation with the senior officer.</p> 
<p>　　“I asked him what he thought we needed to do to best deal with the situation.”</p> 
<p>　　“What did he say?”</p> 
<p>　　“Leave.”</p> 
<p>　　THE STORY OF America’s involvement in Iraq will be analyzed and debated for manyyears to come—indeed, it’s a story that’s still being written. At the moment, thesituation there has deteriorated to the point where it appears that a low-grade civil warhas begun, and while I believe that all Americans—regardless of their views on theoriginal decision to invade—have an interest in seeing a decent outcome in Iraq, Icannot honestly say that I am optimistic about Iraq’s short-term prospects.</p> 
<p>　　I do know that at this stage it will be politics—the calculations of those hard,unsentimental men with whom I had dinner—and not the application of American forcethat determines what happens in Iraq. I believe as well that our strategic goals at thispoint should be well defined: achieving some semblance of stability in Iraq, ensuringthat those in power in Iraq are not hostile to the United States, and preventing Iraq frombecoming a base for terrorist activity. In pursuit of these goals, I believe it is in</p>
