Her lip curled, and she went into her Uncle’s study.
<br> 
<br> “Oh! Uncle Lawrence, you ARE in! Tony Croom’s been here to see you.”
<br> 
<br> “That rather pleasant young man without occupation?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes. He wanted to thank you.”
<br> 
<br> “For nothing, I’m afraid.” And Sir Lawrence’s quick dark eyes, like a snipe’s or woodcock’s, roved sceptically over his pretty niece. She was not, like Dinny, a special favourite, but she was undoubtedly attractive. It was early days to have messed up her marriage; Em had told him and said that it wasn’t to be mentioned. Well, Jerry Corven! People had always shrugged and hinted. Too bad! But no real business of his.
<br> 
<br> A subdued voice from the door said:
<br> 
<br> “Sir Gerald Corven has called, Sir Lawrence.”
<br> 
<br> Involuntarily Sir Lawrence put his finger to his lips. The butler subdued his voice still further.
<br> 
<br> “I put him in the little room and said I would see if Lady Corven was in.”
<br> 
<br> Sir Lawrence noted Clare’s hands hard pressed down on the back of the chair behind which she was standing.
<br> 
<br> “ARE you in, Clare?”
<br> 
<br> She did not answer, but her face was hard and pale as stone.
<br> 
<br> “A minute, Blore. Come back when I ring.”
<br> 
<br> The butler withdrew.
<br> 
<br> “Now, my dear?”
<br> 
<br> “He must have taken the next boat. Uncle, I don’t want to see him.”
<br> 
<br> “If we only say you’re out, he’ll probably come again.”
<br> 
<br> Clare threw back her head. “Well, I’ll see him!”
<br> 
<br> Sir Lawrence felt a little thrill.
<br> 
<br> “If you’d tell me what to say, I’d see him for you.”
<br> 
<br> “Thank you, Uncle, but I don’t see why you should do my dirty work.”
<br> 
<br> Sir Lawrence thought: ‘Thank God!’
<br> 
<br> “I’ll be handy in case you want me. Good luck, my dear!” And he went out.
<br> 
<br> Clare moved over to the fire; she wanted the bell within reach. She had the feeling, well known to her, of settling herself in the saddle for a formidable jump. ‘He shan’t touch me, anyway,’ she thought. She heard Blore’s voice say:
<br> 
<br> “Sir Gerald Corven, my lady.” Quaint! Announcing a husband to his wife! But staff knew everything!
<br> 
<br> Without looking she saw perfectly well where he was standing. A surge of shamed anger stained her cheeks. He had fascinated her; he had used her as every kind of plaything. He had —!
<br> 
<br> His voice, cuttingly controlled, said:
<br> 
<br> “Well, my dear, you were very sudden.” Neat and trim, as ever, and like a cat, with that thin-lipped smile and those daring despoiling eyes!
<br> 
<br> “What do you want?”
<br> 
<br> “Only yourself.”
<br> 
<br> “You can’t have me.”
<br> 
<br> “Absurd!”
<br> 
<br> He made the quickest kind of movement and seized her in his arms. Clare bent her head back and put her finger on the bell.
<br> 
<br> “Move back, or I ring!” and she put her other hand between his face and hers. “Stand over there and I’ll talk to you, otherwise you must go.”
<br> 
<br> “Very well! But it’s ridiculous.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh! Do you think I should have gone if I hadn’t been in earnest?”
<br> 
<br> “I thought you were just riled, and I don’t wonder. I’m sorry.”
<br> 
<br> “It’s no good discussing what happened. I know you, and I’m not coming back to you.”
<br> 
<br> “My dear, you have my apology, and I give you my word against anything of the sort again.”
<br> 
<br> “How good of you!”
<br> 
<br> “It was only an experiment. Some women adore it, if not at the time.”
<br> 
<br> “You are a beast.”
<br> 
<br> “And beauty married me. Come, Clare, don’t be silly, and make us a laughing-stock! You can fix your own conditions.”
<br> 
<br> “And trust you to keep them! Besides, that’s not my idea of a life. I’m only twenty-four.”
<br> 
<br> The smile left his lips.
<br> 
<br> “I see. I noticed a young man come out of this house. Name and estate?”
<br> 
<br> “Tony Croom. Well?”
<br> 
<br> He walked over to the window, and after a moment’s contemplation of the street, turned and said:
<br> 
<br> “You have the misfortune to be my wife.”
<br> 
<br> “So I was thinking.”
<br> 
<br> “Quite seriously, Clare, come back to me.”
<br> 
<br> “Quite seriously, no.”
<br> 
<br> “I have an official position, and I can’t play about with it. Look at me!” He came closer. “I may be all you think me, but I’m neither a humbug nor old-fashioned. I don’t trade on my position, or on the sanctity of marriage, or any of that stuff. But they still pay attention to that sort of thing in the Service, and I can’t afford to let you divorce me.”
<br> 
<br> “I didn’t expect it.”
<br> 
<br> “What then?”
<br> 
<br> “I know nothing except that I’m not coming back.”
<br> 
<br> “Just because of —?”
<br> 
<br> “And a great deal else.” The cat-like smile had come back and prevented her from reading what he was thinking.
<br> 
<br> “Do you want me to divorce you?”
<br> 
<br> Clare shrugged. “You have no reason.”
<br> 
<br> “So you would naturally say.”
<br> 
<br> “And mean.”
<br> 
<br> “Now look here, Clare, this is all absurd, and quite unworthy of anyone with your sense and knowledge of things. You can’t be a perpetual grass widow. You didn’t dislike the life out there.”
<br> 
<br> “There are some things that can’t be done to me, and you have done them.”
<br> 
<br> “I’ve said that they shan’t be done again.”
<br> 
<br> “And I’ve said that I can’t trust you.”
<br> 
<br> “This is going round the mulberry bush. Are you going to live on your people?”
<br> 
<br> “No. I’ve got a job.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh! What?”
<br> 
<br> “Secretary to our new Member.”
<br> 
<br> “You’ll be sick of that in no time.”
<br> 
<br> “I don’t think so.”
<br> 
<br> He stood staring at her without his smile. For a moment she could read his thoughts, for his face had the expression which preludes sex. Suddenly he said: “I won’t stand for another man having you.”
<br> 
<br> It was a comfort to have seen for once the bottom of his mind. She did not answer.
<br> 
<br> “Did you hear me?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes.”
<br> 
<br> “I meant it.”
<br> 
<br> “I could see that.”
<br> 
<br> “You’re a stony little devil.”
<br> 
<br> “I wish I had been.”
<br> 
<br> He took a turn up and down the room, and came to a stand dead in front of her.
<br> 
<br> “Look at me! I’m not going back without you. I’m staying at the Bristol. Be sensible, there’s a darling, and come to me there. We’ll start again. I’ll be ever so nice to you.”
<br> 
<br> Her control gave way, and she cried out: “Oh, for God’s sake, understand! You killed all the feeling I had for you.”
<br> 
<br> His eyes dilated and then narrowed, his lips became a line. He looked like a horse-breaker.
<br> 
<br> “And understand ME,” he said, very low, “you either come back to me or I divorce you. I won’t leave you here, to kick your heels.”
<br> 
<br> “I’m sure you’ll have the approval of every judicious husband.”
<br> 
<br> The smile reappeared on his lips.
<br> 
<br> “For that,” he said, “I’m going to have a kiss.” And before she could stop him he had fastened his lips on hers. She tore herself away and pressed the bell. He went quickly to the door.
<br> 
<br> “Au revoir!” he said, and went out.
<br> 
<br> Clare wiped her lips. She felt bewildered and exhausted, and quite ignorant whether to him or to her the day had gone.
<br> 
<br> She stood leaning her forehead on her hands over the fire, and became aware that Sir Lawrence had come back and was considerately saying nothing.
<br> 
<br> “Awfully sorry, Uncle; I shall be in my digs next week.”
<br> 
<br> “Have a cigarette, my dear.”
<br> 
<br> Clare took the cigarette, and inhaled its comfort. Her uncle had seated himself and she was conscious of the quizzical expression of his eyebrows.
<br> 
<br> “Conference had its usual success?”
<br> 
<br> Clare nodded.
<br> 
<br> “The elusive formula. The fact is, human beings are never satisfied with what they don’t want, however cleverly it’s put. Is it to be continued in our next?”
<br> 
<br> “Not so far as I’m concerned.”
<br> 
<br> “Pity there are always two parties to a conference.”
<br> 
<br> “Uncle Lawrence,” she said suddenly, “what is the law of divorce now?”
<br> 
<br> The baronet uncrossed his long thin legs.
<br> 
<br> “I’ve never had any particular truck with it. I believe it’s less old-fashioned than it was, but see Whitaker.” He reached for the red-backed volume. “Page 258 — here you are, my dear.”
<br> 
<br> Clare read in silence, while he gazed at her ruefully. She looked up and said.
<br> 
<br> “Then, if I want him to divorce me, I’ve got to commit adultery.”
<br> 
<br> “That is, I believe, the elegant way they put it. In the best circles, however, the man does the dirty work.”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, but he won’t. He wants me back. Besides, he’s got his position to consider.”
<br> 
<br> “There is that, of course,” said Sir Lawrence, thoughtfully; “a career in this country is a tender plant.”
<br> 
<br> Clare closed the Whitaker.
<br> 
<br> “If it weren’t for my people,” she said, “I’d give him cause tomorrow and have done with it.”
<br> 
<br> “You don’t think a better way would be to give partnership another trial?”
<br> 
<br> Clare shook her head.
<br> 
<br> “I simply couldn’t.”
<br> 
<br> “That’s that, then,” said Sir Lawrence, “and it’s an awkward ‘that.’ What does Dinny say?”
<br> 
<br> “I haven’t discussed it with her. She doesn’t know he’s here.”
<br> 
<br> “At present, then, you’ve no one to advise you?”
<br> 
<br> “No. Dinny knows why I left, that’s all.”
<br> 
<br> “I should doubt if Jerry Corven is a very patient man.”
<br> 
<br> Clare laughed.
<br> 
<br> “We’re neither of us long-suffering.”
<br> 
<br> “Do you know where he is staying?”
<br> 
<br> “At the Bristol.”
<br> 
<br> “It might,” said Sir Lawrence slowly, “be worth while to keep an eye on him.”
<br> 
<br> Clare shivered. “It’s rather degrading; besides, Uncle, I don’t want to hurt his career. He’s very able, you know.”
<br> 
<br> Sir Lawrence shrugged. “To me,” he said, “and to all your kin, his career is nothing to your good name. How long has he got over here?”
<br> 
<br> “Not long, I should think.”
<br> 
<br> “Would you like me to see him, and try to arrange that you go your own ways?”
<br> 
<br> Clare was silent, and Sir Lawrence, watching her, thought: ‘Attractive, but a lot of naughty temper. Any amount of spirit, and no patience at all.’ Then she said:
<br> 
<br> “It was all my fault, nobody wanted me to marry him. I hate to bother you. Besides, he wouldn’t consent.”
<br> 
<br> “You never know,” murmured Sir Lawrence. “If I get a natural chance, shall I?”
<br> 
<br> “It would be lovely of you, only —”
<br> 
<br> “All right, then. In the meantime young men without jobs — are they wise?”
<br> 
<br> Clare laughed. “Oh, I’ve ‘larned’ him. Well, thank you frightfully, Uncle Lawrence. You’re a great comfort. I was an awful fool; but Jerry has a sort of power, you know; and I’ve always liked taking risks. I don’t see how I can be my mother’s daughter, she hates them; and Dinny only takes them on principle.” She sighed. “I won’t bore you any more now.” And, blowing a kiss, she went out.
<br> 
<br> Sir Lawrence stayed in his armchair thinking: ‘Putting my oar in! A nasty mess, and going to be nastier! Still, at her age something’s got to be done. I must talk to Dinny.’
