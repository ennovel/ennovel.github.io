<br> 
<br> “Penny for your thoughts, Miss Cherrell?”
<br> 
<br> “I was thinking how the English face has changed since 1900.”
<br> 
<br> “It’s the hair. Faces in pictures a hundred to a hundred and fifty years ago are much more like ours.”
<br> 
<br> “Drooping moustaches and chignons do hide expression, but was there the expression?”
<br> 
<br> “You don’t think the Victorians had as much character?”
<br> 
<br> “Probably more, but surely they suppressed it; even in their dresses, always more stuff than was needed; frock-coats, high collars, cravats, bustles, button boots.”
<br> 
<br> “The leg WAS on their nerves, but the neck wasn’t.”
<br> 
<br> “I give you the woman’s necks. But look at their furniture: tassels, fringes, antimacassars, chandeliers, enormous sideboards. They DID play hide-and-seek with the soul, Mr. Dornford.”
<br> 
<br> “And every now and then it popped out, like little Edward after unclothing himself under his mother’s dining-table at Windsor.”
<br> 
<br> “He never did anything quite so perfect again.”
<br> 
<br> “I don’t know. He was another Restoration in a mild way. Big opening of floodgates under him.” . . .
<br> 
<br> “He HAS sailed, hasn’t he, Clare?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, he’s sailed all right. Look at Dornford! He’s fallen for Dinny completely. I wish she’d take to him.”
<br> 
<br> “Why shouldn’t she?”
<br> 
<br> “My dear young man, Dinny’s been in very deep waters. She’s in them even now.”
<br> 
<br> “I don’t know anyone I’d like better for a sister-inlaw.”
<br> 
<br> “Don’t you wish you may get her?”
<br> 
<br> “God! Yes! Don’t I!”
<br> 
<br> “What do YOU think of Dornford, Tony?”
<br> 
<br> “Awfully decent, not a bit dry.”
<br> 
<br> “If he were a doctor he’d have a wonderful bedside manner. He’s a Catholic.”
<br> 
<br> “Wasn’t that against him in the election?”
<br> 
<br> “It would have been, but his opponent was an atheist, so they cried quits.”
<br> 
<br> “Terrible humbug, politics.”
<br> 
<br> “But rather fun.”
<br> 
<br> “Still, Dornford won that Bar point-to-point — he must have guts.”
<br> 
<br> “Lots. I should say he’d face anything in his quiet way. I’m quite fond of him.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh!”
<br> 
<br> “No intention to incite you, Tony.”
<br> 
<br> “This is like being on board ship, sitting side by side, and — stymied. Come out for a cigarette.”
<br> 
<br> “People are coming back. Prepare yourself to point me the moral of the next act. At present I don’t see any.”
<br> 
<br> “Wait!” . . .
<br> 
<br> Dinny drew in her breath.
<br> 
<br> “That’s terrible. I can just remember the Titanic. Awful, the waste in the world!”
<br> 
<br> “You’re right.”
<br> 
<br> “Waste of life, and waste of love.”
<br> 
<br> “Have YOU come up against much waste?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes.”
<br> 
<br> “You don’t care to talk about it?”
<br> 
<br> “No.”
<br> 
<br> “I don’t believe that your sister’s going to be wasted. She’s too vivid.”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, but her head’s in chancery.”
<br> 
<br> “She’ll duck from under.”
<br> 
<br> “I can’t bear to think of her life being spoiled. Isn’t there some legal dodge, Mr. Dornford; without publicity, I mean?”
<br> 
<br> “If he would give cause, there need be very little of that.”
<br> 
<br> “He won’t. He’s feeling vindictive.”
<br> 
<br> “I see. Then I’m afraid there’s nothing for it but to wait. These things generally disentangle themselves. Catholics are not supposed to believe in divorce. But if YOU feel this is a case for one —”
<br> 
<br> “Clare’s only twenty-four. She can’t live alone the rest of her life.”
<br> 
<br> “Were YOU thinking of doing that?”
<br> 
<br> “I! That’s different.”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, you’re very unlike, but to have you wasted would be far worse. Just as much worse as wasting a lovely day in winter is than wasting one in summer.”
<br> 
<br> “The curtain’s going up.” . . .
<br> 
<br> “I wonder,” muttered Clare: “It didn’t look to me as if their love would have lasted long. They were eating each other like sugar.”
<br> 
<br> “My God, if you and I on that boat had been —”
<br> 
<br> “You’re very young, Tony.”
<br> 
<br> “Two years older than you.”
<br> 
<br> “And about ten years younger.”
<br> 
<br> “Don’t you really believe in love lasting, Clare?”
<br> 
<br> “Not passion. And after that generally the deluge. Only with those two on the Titanic it came too soon. A COLD sea! Ugh!”
<br> 
<br> “Let me pull your cloak up.”
<br> 
<br> “I don’t believe I like this show too frightfully, Tony. It digs into you, and I don’t want to be dug into.”
<br> 
<br> “I liked it better the first time, certainly.”
<br> 
<br> “Thank you!”
<br> 
<br> “It’s being close to you, and not close enough. But the war part of the play’s the best.”
<br> 
<br> “The whole thing makes me feel I don’t want to be alive.”
<br> 
<br> “That’s ‘the satire.’”
<br> 
<br> “One half of him is mocking the other. It gives me the fidgets. Too like oneself.”
<br> 
<br> “I wish we’d gone to a movie, I could have held your hand.”
<br> 
<br> “Dornford’s looking at Dinny as if she were the Madonna of the future that he wanted to make a Madonna of the past.”
<br> 
<br> “So he does, you say.”
<br> 
<br> “He really has a nice face. I wonder what he’ll think of the war part. ‘Weigh-hey! Up she rises!’” . . .
<br> 
<br> Dinny sat with closed eyes, acutely feeling the remains of moisture on her cheeks.
<br> 
<br> “But she never would have done that,” she said, huskily, “not waved a flag and cheered. Never! She might have mixed in the crowd, but never that!”
<br> 
<br> “No, that’s a stage touch. Pity! But a jolly good act. Really good!”
<br> 
<br> “Those poor gay raddled singing girls, getting more and more wretched and raddled, and that ‘Tipperary’ whistling! The war must have been AWFUL!”
<br> 
<br> “One got sort of exalted.”
<br> 
<br> “Did that feeling last?”
<br> 
<br> “In a way. Does that seem rather horrible to you?”
<br> 
<br> “I never can judge what people ought to feel. I’ve heard my brother say something of the kind.”
<br> 
<br> “It wasn’t the ‘Into Battle’ feeling either — I’m not the fighting man. It’s a cliché to say it was the biggest thing that will ever be in one’s life.”
<br> 
<br> “You still feel that?”
<br> 
<br> “It has been up to now. But —! I must tell you while I’ve a chance — I’m in love with you, Dinny. I know nothing about you, you know nothing about me. That doesn’t make any difference. I fell in love with you at once; it’s been getting deeper ever since. I don’t expect you to say anything, but you might think about it now and then . . . .”
<br> 
<br> Clare shrugged her shoulders.
<br> 
<br> “Did people really go on like that at the Armistice? Tony! Did people —?”
<br> 
<br> “What?”
<br> 
<br> “Really go on like that?”
<br> 
<br> “I don’t know.”
<br> 
<br> “Where were you?”
<br> 
<br> “At Wellington, my first term. My father was killed in the war.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh! I suppose mine might have been, and my brother. But even then! Dinny says my mother cried when the Armistice came.”
<br> 
<br> “So did mine, I believe.”
<br> 
<br> “The bit I liked best was that between the son and the girl. But the whole thing makes you feel too much. Take me out, I want a cigarette. No, we’d better not. One always meets people.”
<br> 
<br> “Damn!”
<br> 
<br> “Coming here with you was the limit. I’ve promised solemnly not to give offence for a whole year. Oh! cheer up! You’ll see lots of me . . . .”
<br> 
<br> “‘Greatness, and dignity, and peace,’” murmured Dinny, standing up, “and the greatest of these is ‘dignity.’”
<br> 
<br> “The hardest to come by, anyway.”
<br> 
<br> “That girl singing in the night club, and the jazzed sky! Thank you awfully, Mr. Dornford. I shan’t forget this play easily.”
<br> 
<br> “Nor what I said to you?”
<br> 
<br> “It was very sweet of you, but the aloe only blooms once in a hundred years.”
<br> 
<br> “I can wait. It’s been a wonderful evening for me.”
<br> 
<br> “Those two!”
<br> 
<br> “We’ll pick them up in the hall.”
<br> 
<br> “Do you think England ever had greatness and dignity and peace?”
<br> 
<br> “No.”
<br> 
<br> “But ‘There’s a green hill far away, without a city wall.’ Thank you — I’ve had this cloak three years.”
<br> 
<br> “Charming it is!”
<br> 
<br> “I suppose most of these people will go on to night clubs now.”
<br> 
<br> “Not five per cent.”
<br> 
<br> “I should like a sniff of home air to-night, and a long look at the stars . . . .”
<br> 
<br> Clare turned her head.
<br> 
<br> “Don’t, Tony!”
<br> 
<br> “How then?”
<br> 
<br> “You’ve been with me all the evening.”
<br> 
<br> “If only I could take you home!”
<br> 
<br> “You can’t, my dear. Squeeze my little finger, and pull yourself together.”
<br> 
<br> “Clare!”
<br> 
<br> “Look! They’re just in front — now vanish! Get a good long drink at the Club and dream of horses. There! Was that close enough? Good-night, dear Tony!”
<br> 
<br> “God! Good-night!”
