It was a hearty blaze and lit up all the near cliffs with a ruddyjumping glow which gave their occu- pants a marvellous appearance oflife. The heat also brought off the dull rime upon the side of my recess,leaving it clear as polished glass, and I was a little startled to see, only aninch or so back in the ice and standing as erect as ever he had been in life,the figure of an imposing grey clad man. His arms were folded, his chindropped upon his chest, his robes of the finest stuff, the very flowers theyhad decked his head with frozen with immortality, and under them, roundhis crisp and iron-grey hair, a simple band of gold with strange runes andfigures engraved upon it.</p> 
<p>　　There was something very simple yet stately about him, though hisface was hidden and as I gazed long and in- tently the idea got hold of methat he had been a king over an undegenerate Martian race, and had stoodwaiting for the Dawn a very, very long time.</p> 
<p>　　I wished a little that he had not been quite so near the glassy surface ofthe ice down which the warmth was bringing quick moisture drops. Hadhe been back there in the blue depths where others were sitting andcrouching it would have been much more comfortable. But I was a sailor,and misfortune makes strange companions, so I piled up the fire again, andlying down presently on the dry shingle with my back to him staredmoodily at the blaze till slowly the fatigues of the day told, my eyelidsdropped and, with many a fitful start and turn, at length I slept.</p> 
<p>　　It was an hour before dawn, the fire had burnt low and I was dreamingof an angry discussion with my tailor in New York as to the sit of my lastnew trousers when a faint sound of moving shingle caught my quickseaman ear, and before I could raise my head or lift a hand, a man's weightwas on me--a heavy, strong man who bore me down with irresistible force.</p> 
<p>　　I felt the slap of his ice-cold hand upon my throat and his teeth in the backof my neck! In an instant, though but half awake, with a yell of surprise&nbsp; and anger I grappled with the enemy, and exerting all my strength rolledhim over. Over and over we went struggling to- wards the fire, and whenI got him within a foot or so of it I came out on top, and, digging myknuckles into his throttle, banged his head upon the stony floor in recklessrage, until all of a sudden it seemed to me he was done for. I relaxed mygrip, but the other man never moved. I shook him again, like a terrierwith a rat, but he never resented it. Had I killed him? How limp and coldhe was! And then all of a sudden an uneasy feeling came upon me. Ireached out, and throwing a handful of dried stuff upon the embers the firedanced gaily up into the air, and the blaze showed me I was savagelyholding down to the gravel and kneeling on the chest of that long-deadking from my grotto wall!</p> 
<p>　　It was the man out of the ice without a doubt. There was the veryniche he had fallen from under the influence of the fire heat, the veryrecess, exactly in his shape in every detail, whence he had stood gazinginto vacuity all those years. I left go my hold, and after the flutter in myheart had gone down, apologetically set him up against the wall of thecavern whence he had fallen; then built up the fire until twirling flamesdanced to the very roof in the blue light of dawn, and hobgoblin shadowsleapt and capered about us. Then once more I sat down on the oppositeside of the blaze, resting my chin upon my hands, and stared into thefrozen eyes of that grim stranger, who, with his chin upon his knees, staredback at me with irresistible, remorseless steadfastness.</p> 
<p>　　He was as fresh as if he had died but yesterday, yet by his clothing andsomething in his appearance, which was not that of the Martian of to-day,I knew he might be many thousand years old. What things he had seen,what wonders he knew! What a story might be put into his mouth if Iwere a capable writer gifted with time and imagination instead of a pooroutcast, ill-paid lieutenant whose literary wit is often taxed hardly to filleven a log- book entry! I stared at him so long and hard, and he at methrough the blinking flames, that again I dozed--and dozed-- and dozedagain until at last when I woke in good earnest it was daylight.</p> 
<p>　　By this time hunger was very aggressive. The fire was naught but acirclet of grey ashes; the dead king, still sitting against the cave-side,&nbsp; looked very blue and cold, and with an uncomfortable realisation of myposition I shook myself together, picked up and pocketed without muchthought the queer gold circlet that had dropped from his forehead, andwent outside to see what prospect of escape the new day had brought.</p> 
<p>　　It was not much. Upriver there was not the remotest chance. Noteven a Niagara steamer could have forged back against the sluice comingdown from the gulch there. Looking round, the sides of the icyamphitheatre--just lighting up now with glorious gold and crimsonglimmers of morning--were as steep as a wall face; only back towards thefalls was there a possibility of getting out of the dreadful trap, so thither Iwent, after a last look at the poor old king, along my narrow beach with allthe eagerness begotten of a final chance. Up to the very brink it lookedhopeless enough, but, looking downwards when that was reached, insteadof a sheer drop the slope seemed to be a wild "staircase" of rocks and icyledges with here and there a little patch of sand on a cornice, and far below,five hundred feet or so, a good big spread of gravel an acre or two inextent close by where the river plunged out of sight into the nethermostcavern mouth.</p> 
<p>　　It was so hopeless up above it, it could not possibly be worse furtherdown, and there was the ugly black flood running into the hole to trustmyself to as a last resource; so slipping and sliding I began the descent.</p> 
<p>　　Had I been a schoolboy with a good breakfast ahead the incident mighthave been amusing enough. The travel- ling was mostly done on the seatof my trousers, which consequently became caked with mud and glacialloam. Some was accomplished on hands and knees, with now and then abit down a snow slope, in good, honest head-over- heels fashion. Theresult was a fine appetite for the next meal when it should pleaseprovidence to send it, and an abrupt arrival on the bottom beach about fiveminutes after leaving the upper circles.</p> 
<p>　　I came to behind a cluster of breast-high rocks, and before movingtook a look round. Judge then of my as- tonishment and delight at thesecond glance to perceive about a hundred yards away a brown object,looking like an ape in the half light, meandering slowly up the margin ofthe water towards me. Every now and then it stopped, stooping down to&nbsp; pick up something or other from the scum along the torrent, and it was thefact that these trifles, whatever they were, were put into a wallet by thevision's side--not into his mouth--which first made me understand with ajoyful thrill that it was a MAN before me--a real, living man in this hugechamber of dead horrors! Then again it flashed across my mind in aluminous moment that where one man could come, or go, or live, anothercould do likewise, and never did cat watch mouse with more concentrated eagerness than I that quaint, bent-shouldered thing hobblingabout in the blue morning shadows where all else was silence.</p> 
<p>　　Nearer and nearer he came, till so close face and garb were discernible,and then there could no longer be any doubt, it was a woodman, an oldman, with grizzled monkey-face, stooping gait, and a shaggy fur cloak,utterly unlike the airy garments of my Hither folk, who now stood beforeme. It gave me quite a start to recognise him there, for it showed I was ina new land, and since he was going so cheerfully about his business,whatever it might chance to be, there must be some way out of thisaccursed pit in which I had fallen. So very cautiously I edged out, takingadvantage of all the cover possible until we were only twenty yards apart,and then suddenly standing up, and putting on the most affable smile, Icalled out-"Hullo, mess-mate!"The effect was electrical. That quaint old fellow sprang a yard intoair as though a spring had shot him up. Then, coming down, he stoodtransfixed at his full height as stiff as a ramrod, staring at me withincredible wonder. He looked so funny that in spite of hunger andloneliness I burst out laughing, whereat the woodman, suddenlyrecovering his senses, turned on his heels and set off at his best pace in theopposite direction. This would never do! I wanted him to be my guide,philosopher, and friend. He was my sole visible link with the outsideworld, so after him I went at tip-top speed, and catching him up in fiftyyards along the shingle laid hold of his nether garments. Whereat the oldfellow stopping suddenly I shot clean over his back, coming down on myshoulder in the gravel.</p> 
<p>　　But I was much younger than he, and in a minute was in chase again.</p> 
<p>　　This time I laid hold of his cloak, and the moment he felt my grip heslipped the neck-thongs and left me with only the mangy garment in myhands. Again we set off, dodging and scampering with all our mightupon that frozen bit of beach. The activity of that old fellow wasmarvellous, but I could not and would not lose him. I made a rush andgrappled him, but he tossed his head round and slipped away once moreunder my arm, as though he had been brought up by a Chinese wrestler.</p> 
<p>　　Then he got on one side of a flat rock, I the other, and for three or fourminutes we waltzed round that slab in the most insane manner.</p> 
<p>　　But by this time we were both pretty well spent--he with age and Iwith faintness from my long fast, and we came presently to a standstill.</p> 
<p>　　After glaring at me for a time, the woodman gasped out as hestruggled for breath-"Oh, mighty and dreadful spirit! Oh, dweller in pri- mordial ice, sayfrom which niche of the cliffs has the breath of chance thawed you?""Never a niche at all, Mr. Hunter-for-Haddocks'-Eyes," I answered assoon as I could speak. "I am just a castaway wrecked last night on thisshore of yours, and very grateful indeed will I be if you can show me theway to some breakfast first, and afterwards to the outside world."But the old fellow would not believe. "Spirits such as you," he saidsullenly, "need no food, and go whither they will by wish alone.""I tell you I am not a spirit, and as hungry as I don't particularly wantto be again. Here, look at the back of my trousers, caked three inchesdeep in mud. If I were a spirit, do you think I would slide about on mycoat-tails like that? Do you think that if I could travel by volition I wouldslip down these infernal cliffs on my pants' seat as I have just done? Andas for materialism--look at this fist; it punched you just now! Surelythere was nothing spiritual in that knock?''</p> 
<p>　　"No," said the savage, rubbing his head, "it was a good, honest rap, soI must take you at your word. If you are indeed man, and hungry, it willbe a charity to feed you; if you are a spirit, it will at least be interesting towatch you eat; so sit down, and let's see what I have in my wallet."So cross-legged we squatted opposite each other on the table rock, and,feeling like another Sindbad the Sailor, I watched my new friend fumble in&nbsp; his bag and lay out at his side all sorts of odds and ends of string, fishhooks, chew- ing-gum, material for making a fire, and so on, until at lasthe came to a package (done up, I noted with delight, in a broad, green leafwhich had certainly been growing that morning), and unrolling it,displayed a lump of dried meat, a few biscuits, much thicker and heavierthan the honey- cakes of the Hither folk, and something that looked andsmelt like strong, white cheese.</p> 
<p>　　He signed to me to eat, and you may depend upon it I was not slow inaccepting the invitation. That tough biltong tasted to me like thetenderest steak that ever came from a grill; the biscuits were ambrosial; thecheese melted in my mouth as butter melts in that of the virtuous; butwhen the old man finished the quaint picnic by inviting me to accompanyhim down to the waterside for a drink, I shook my head. I had a greatrespect for dead queens and kings, I said, but there were too many of themup above to make me thirsty this morning; my respect did not go tomaking me desire to imbibe them in solution!</p> 
<p>　　Afterwards I chanced to ask him what he had been pick- ing up justnow along the margin, and after looking at me suspiciously for a minutehe asked-"You are not a thief?" On being reassured on that point he continued:</p> 
<p>　　"And you will not attempt to rob me of the harvest for which I venture intothis ghost-haunted glen, which you and I alone of living men have seen?""No." Whatever they were, I said, I would respect his earnings.</p> 
<p>　　"Very well, then," said the old man, "look here! I come hither to pickup those pretty trifles which yonder lords and ladies have done with," andplunging his hand into an- other bag he brought out a perfect fistful ofsplendid gems and jewels, some set and some unset. "They wash fromthe hands and wrists of those who have lodgings in the crevices of the fallsabove," he explained. "After a time the beach here will be thick withthem. Could I get up whence you came down, they might be gathered bythe sackful. Come! there is an eddy still unsearched, and I will show youhow they lie."It was very fascinating, and I and that old man set to work amongst thegravels, and, to be brief, in half an hour found enough glittering stuff to set&nbsp; up a Fifth Avenue jewel- ler's shop. But to tell the truth, now that I hadbreakfasted, and felt manhood in my veins again, I was eager to be off,and out of the close, death-tainted atmosphere of that valley.</p> 
<p>　　Consequently I presently stood up and said-"Look here, old man, this is fine sport no doubt, but just at present Ihave a big job on hand--one which will not wait, and I must be going.</p> 
<p>　　See, luck and young eyes have favoured me; here is twice as much goldand stones as you have got together--it is all yours without a question ifyou will show me the way out of this den and afterwards put me on theroad to your big city, for thither I am bound with an errand to your king,Ar-hap."The sight of my gems, backed, perhaps, with the men- tion of Ar-hap'sname, appealed to the old fellow; and af- ter a grunt or two about "losing atide" just when spoil was so abundant, he accepted the bargain, shoulderedhis be- longings, and led me towards the far corner of the beach.</p> 
<p>　　It looked as if we were walking right against the tower-ing ice wall,but when we were within a yard or two of it a narrow cleft, only eighteeninches wide, and wonderfully masked by an ice column, showed to the left,and into this we squeezed ourselves, the entrance by which we had comeappearing to close up instantly we had gone a pace or two, so perfectly didthe ice walls match each other.</p> 
<p>　　It was the most uncanny thoroughfare conceivable--a sheer, sharpcrack in the blue ice cliffs extending from where the sunlight shone in adazzling golden band five hundred feet overhead to where bottom wastouched in blue ob- scurity of the ice-foot. It was so narrow we had totravel sideways for the most part, a fact which brought my face closeagainst the clear blue glass walls, and enabled me from time to time to see,far back in those translucent depths, more and more and evermore frozenMartians waiting in stony silence for their release.</p> 
<p>　　But the fact of facts was that slowly the floor of the cleft trendedupwards, whilst the sky strip appeared to come downwards to meet it. Amile, perhaps, we growled and squeezed up that wonderful gully; thenwith a feeling of incredible joy I felt the clear, outer air smiting upon me.</p> 
<p>　　In my hurry and delight I put my head into the small of the back of&nbsp; the puffing old man who blocked the way in front and forced him forward,until at last--before we expected it--the cleft suddenly ended, and he and Itumbled headlong over each other on to a glittering, frozen snowslope; thesky azure overhead, the sunshine warm as a tepid bath, and a wideprospect of mountain and plain extending all around.</p> 
<p>　　So delightful was the sudden change of circumstances that I becamequite boyish, and seizing the old man in my exub- erance by the hands,dragged him to his feet, and danced him round and round in a circle, whilehis ancient hair flapped about his head, his skin cloak waved from hisshoulders like a pair of dusky wings and half-eaten cakes, dried flesh,glittering jewels, broken diadems, and golden finger-rings were flung in anarc about us. We capered till fairly out of breath, and then, slapping himon the back shoulder, I asked whose land all this was about us.</p> 
<p>　　He replied that it was no one's, all waste from verge to verge.</p> 
<p>　　"What!" was my exclamation. "All ownerless, and with so muchtreasure hidden hereabout! Why, I shall annex it to my country, and youand I will peg out original settlers' claims!" And, still excited by themountain air, I whipped out my sword, and in default of a star-spangledbanner to plant on the newly-acquired territory, traced in gigantic letterson the snow-crust--U.S.A.</p> 
<p>　　"And now," I added, wiping the rime off my blade with the lappet ofmy coat, "let us stop capering about here and get to business. You havepromised to put me on the way to your big city.""Come on then," said the little man, gathering up his property. "Thiswhite hillside leads to nowhere; we must get into the valley first, and thenyou shall see your road." And right well that quaint barbarian kept hispromise.</p>
