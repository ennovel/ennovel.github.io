But anyimposing State entry which might have been intended was renderedimpossible by the heat and the threat of that baleful world in the westernsky.</p> 
<p>　　It was a lurid but disordered spectacle which I wit- nessed from myroom in the gate-house just after nightfall. The returning army hadapparently fallen away exhausted on its march through the town; onlysome three hundred of the bodyguard straggled up the hill, limp andsweating, behind a group of pennons, in the midst of which rode ahorseman whose commanding presence and splendid war harnessimpressed me, though I could not make out his features; a wild,impressionist scene of black outlines, tossing headgear, and spearsglittering and vanishing in front of the red glare in the sky, but nothingmore. Even the dry throats of the suitors in the courtyard hardlymustered a husky cry of welcome as the cavalcade trooped into theenclosure, and then the shadows enfolded them up in silence, and, too hotand listless to care much what the morrow brought forth, I threw myselfon the bare floor, tossing and turning in a vain endeavour to sleep untildawn came once more.</p> 
<p>　　A thin mist which fell with daybreak drew a veil over the horribleglare in the west for an hour or two, and taking advantage of the slightalleviation of heat, I rose and went into the gardens to enjoy a dip in a pool,making, with its surrounding jungle of flowers, one of the pleasantestthings about the wood-king's forest citadel. The very earth seemedscorched and baking underfoot--and the pool was gone! It had run as dryas a limekiln; nothing remained of the pretty fall which had fed it but amiserable trickle of drops from the cascade above. Down beyond thetown shone a gleam of water where the bitter canal steamed and simmered in the first grey of the morning, but up here six months of scorchingdrought could not have worked more havoc. The very leaves weredropping from the trees, and the luxuriant growths of the day before&nbsp; looked as though a simoon had played upon them.</p> 
<p>　　I staggered back in disgust, and found some show of official activityabout the palace. It was the king's custom, it appeared, to hear petitionsand redress wrongs as soon after his return as possible, but today theceremony was to be cut short as his majesty was going out with all hiscourt to a neighbouring mountain to "pray away the comet," which by thistime was causing dire alarm all through the city.</p> 
<p>　　"Heaven's own particular blessing on his prayers, my friend," I said tothe man who told me this. "Unless his majesty's orisons are fruitful, weshall all be cooked like baked potatoes before nightfall, and though I havefaced many kinds of death, that is not the one I would choose bypreference. Is there a chance of myself being heard at the throne? Yourpeculiar climate tempts me to hurry up with my business and begone if Imay.""Not only may you be heard, sir, but you are sum- moned. The kinghas heard of you somehow, and sent me to find and bring you into hispresence at once.""So be it," I said, too hot to care what happened. "I have no leveedress with me. I lost my luggage check some time ago, but if you willwait outside I will be with you in a moment."Hastily tidying myself up, and giving my hair a comb, as though justoff to see Mr. Secretary for the Navy, or on the way to get a senator topush a new patent medicine for me, I rejoined my guide outside, andtogether we crossed the wide courtyard, entered the great log-built portalsof Ar-hap's house, and immediately afterwards found ourselves in a vasthall dimly lit by rays coming in through square spaces under the eaves,and crowded on both sides with guards, courtiers, and supplicants. Theheat was tre- mendous, the odour of Thither men and the ill-dressed hidesthey wore almost overpowering. Yet little I recked for either, for there atthe top of the room, seated on a dais made of rough-hewn wood inlet withgold and covered with splendid furs, was Ar-hap himself.</p> 
<p>　　A fine fellow, swarthy, huge, and hairy, at any other time or place Icould have given him due admiration as an admirable example of thesavage on the borderland of grace and culture, but now I only glanced at&nbsp; him, and then to where at his side a girl was crouching, a gem of humanloveliness against that dusky setting. It was Heru, my ravished princess,and, still clad in her diaphanous Hither robes, her face white with anxiety,her eyes bright as stars, the embodiment of helpless, flowery beauty, myheart turned over at sight of her.</p> 
<p>　　Poor girl! When she saw me stride into the hall she rose swiftly fromAr-hap's side, clasped her pretty hands, and giving a cry of joy would haverushed towards me, but the king laid a mighty paw upon her, under whichshe subsided with a shiver as though the touch had blanched all the lifewithin.</p> 
<p>　　"Good morning, your majesty," I said, walking boldly up to the lowerstep of the dais.</p> 
<p>　　"Good morning, most singular-looking vagrant from the Unknown,"answered the monarch. "In what way can I be of service to you?''</p> 
<p>　　"I have come about that girl," I said, nodding to where Heru layblossoming in the hot gloom like some night- flowering bud. "I do notknow whether your majesty is aware how she came here, but it is a highlydiscreditable incident in what is doubtless your otherwise blameless reign.</p> 
<p>　　Some rough scullions intrusted with the duty of col- lecting your majesty'scustoms asked Prince Hath of the Hither people to point out the mostattractive young person at his wedding feast, and the prince indicated thatlady there at your side. It was a dirty trick, and all the worse because itwas inspired by malice, which is the meanest of all weaknesses. I hadthe pleasure of knocking down some of your majesty's representatives, butthey stole the girl away while I slept, and, briefly, I have come to fetch herback."The monarch had followed my speech, the longest ever made in mylife, with fierce, blinking eyes, and when it stopped looked at poorshrinking Heru as though for ex- planation, then round the circle of hisawestruck courtiers, and reading dismay at my boldness in their faces,burst into a guttural laugh.</p> 
<p>　　"I suppose you have the great and puissant Hither nation behind you inthis request, Mr. Spirit?""No, I came alone, hoping to find justice here, and, if not, then&nbsp; prepared to do all I could to make your majesty curse the day yourservants maltreated my friends.""Tall words, stranger! May I ask what you propose to do if Ar-hap, inhis own palace, amongst his people and soldiers, refuses to disgorge apretty prize at the bidding of one shabby interloper--muddy andfriendless?""What should I do?""Yes," said the king, with a haughty frown. "What would you do?"I do not know what prompted the reply. For a moment I wascompletely at a loss what to say to this very obvious question, and then allon a sudden, remembering they held me to be some kind of disembodiedspirit, by a happy inspiration, fixing my eyes grimly on the king, Ianswered,"What would I do? Why, I WOULD HAUNT YOU!"It may not seem a great stroke of genius here, but the effect on theMartian was instantaneous. He sat straight up, his hands tightened, hiseyes dilated, and then fidgeting un- easily, after a minute he beckoned toan over-dressed in- dividual, whom Heru afterwards told me was the Courtnecromancer, and began whispering in his ear.</p> 
<p>　　After a minute's consultation he turned again, a rather frightenedcivility struggling in his face with anger, and said, "We have no wish, ofcourse, stranger, to offend you or those who had the honour of yourpatronage. Perhaps the princess here was a little roughly handled, and, Icon- fess, if she were altogether as reluctant as she seems, a lesser maidwould have done as well. I could have wooed this one in Seth, where Imay shortly come, and our espousals would possibly have lent, in the eyesof your friends, quite a cheerful aspect to my arrival. But my ambassadors have had no great schooling in diplomacy; they have broughtPrincess Heru here, and how can I hand her over to one I know nothing of?</p> 
<p>　　How do I know you are a ghost, after all? How do I know you haveanything but a rusty sword and much impertinence to back your astounding claim?""Oh, let it be just as you like," I said, calmly shelling and eating a nut Ihad picked up. "Only if you do not give the maid back, why, then--" And&nbsp; I stopped as though the sequel were too painful to put into words.</p> 
<p>　　Again that superstitious monarch of a land thronged with maliciousspirits called up his magician, and, after they had consulted a moment,turned more cheerfully to me.</p> 
<p>　　"Look here, Mister-from-Nowhere, if you are really a spirit, and havethe power to hurt as you say, you will have the power also to go and comebetween the living and the dead, between the present and the past. Now Iwill set you an errand, and give you five minutes to do it in.""Five minutes!" I exclaimed in incautious alarm.</p> 
<p>　　"Five minutes," said the monarch savagely. "And if in that time theerrand is not done, I shall hold you to be an impostor, an impudent thieffrom some scoundrel tribe of this world of mine, and will make of you anexample which shall keep men's ears tingling for a century or two."Poor Heru dropped in a limp and lovely heap at that dire threat, while Iam bound to say I felt somewhat uncomfortable, not unnaturally when allthe circumstances are considered, but contented myself with remarking,with as much bravado as could be managed,"And now to the errand, Ar-hap. What can I do for your majesty?"The king consulted with the rogue at his elbow, and then nodding andchuckling in expectancy of his triumph, addressed me.</p> 
<p>　　"Listen," he cried, smiting a huge hairy hand upon his knee, "listen,and do or die. My magician tells me it is record- ed in his books thatonce, some five thousand years ago, when this land belonged to the Hitherpeople, there lived here a king. It is a pity he died, for he seems to havebeen a jovial old fellow; but he did die, and, according to their custom,they floated him down the stream that flows to the regions of eternal ice,where doubtless he is at this present moment, caked up with ten million ofhis subjects. Now just go and find that sovereign for me, oh you bold-tongued dweller in other worlds!""And if I go how am I to know your ancient king, as you say, amongstten million others?""That is easy enough," quoth Ar-hap lightly. "You have only to passto and fro through the ice mountains, opening the mouths of the dead menand women you meet, and when you come to a middle-sized man with a&nbsp; fillet on his head and a jaw mended with gold, that will be he whom youlook for. Bring me that fillet here within five minutes and the maid isyours."I started, and stared hard in amazement. Was this a dream? Was theroyal savage in front playing with me? By what incredible chance had hehit upon the very errand I could answer to best, the very trophy I hadbrought away from the grim valley of ice and death, and had still in myshoulder-bag? No, he was not playing; he was staring hard in turn,joying in my apparent confusion, and clearly thinking he had cornered mebeyond hope of redemption.</p> 
<p>　　"Surely your mightiness is not daunted by so simple a task," scowledthe sovereign, playing with the hilt of his huge hunting-knife, "and allamongst your friends' kindred too. On a hot day like this it ought to be apleasant saunter for a spirit such as yourself.""Not daunted," I answered coldly, turning on my heels towards thedoor, "only marvelling that your majesty's skull and your necromancer'scould not between them have de- vised a harder task."Out into the courtyard I went, with my heart beating finely in spite ofmy assumed indifference; got the bag from a peg in my sleeping-room,and was back before the log throne ere four minutes were gone.</p> 
<p>　　"The old Hither king's compliments to your majesty," I said, bowing,while a deathly hush fell on all the assembly, "and he says though yourancestors little liked to hear his voice while alive, he says he has noobjection to giving you some jaw now he is dead," and I threw down onthe floor the golden circlet of the frozen king.</p> 
<p>　　Ar-hap's eyes almost started from his head as, with his courtiers, heglared in silent amazement at that shining thing while the great drops offear and perspiration trickled down his forehead. As for poor Heru, sherose like a spirit behind them, gazed at the jaw-bone of her mythical ancestor, and then suddenly realising my errand was done and she apparentlyfree, held out her hands, and, with a tremulous cry, would have come tome.</p> 
<p>　　But Ar-hap was too quick for her. All the black savage blood swelledinto his veins as he swept her away with one great arm, and then with his&nbsp; foot gave the luckless jaw a kick that sent it glittering and spinningthrough the far doorway out into the sunshine.</p> 
<p>　　"Sit down," he roared, "you brazen wench, who are so eager to leave aking's side for a nameless vagrant's care! And you, sir," turning to me, andfairly trembling with rage and dread, "I will not gainsay that you havedone the errand set you, but it might this once be chance that got you thatcursed token, some one happy turn of luck. I will not yield my prize onone throw of the dice. Another task you must do. Once might bechance, but such chance comes not twice.""You swore to give me the maid this time.""And why should I keep my word to a half-proved spirit such as you?""There are some particularly good reasons why you should," I said,striking an attitude which I had once seen a music-hall dramatist takewhen he was going to blast somebody's future--a stick with a star on top ofit in his hand and forty lines of blank verse in his mouth.</p> 
<p>　　The king writhed, and begged me with a sign to desist.</p> 
<p>　　"We have no wish to anger you. Do us this other task and none willdoubt that you are a potent spirit, and even I, Ar-hap, will listen to you.""Well, then," I answered sulkily, "what is it to be this time?"After a minute's consultation, and speaking slowly as thoughconscious of how much hung on his words, the king said,"Listen! My soothsayer tells me that somewhere there is a city lost ina forest, and a temple lost in the city, and a tomb lost in the temple; a cityof ghosts and djins given over to bad spirits, wherefore all human menshun it by day and night. And on the tomb is she who was once queenthere, and by her lies her crown. Quick! oh you to whom all dis- tancesare nothing, and who see, by your finer essence, into all times and places.</p> 
<p>　　Away to that city! Jostle the memories of the unclean things that hide inits shadows; ask which amongst them knows where dead Queen Yang stilllies in dusty state. Get guides amongst your comrade ghosts. FindQueen Yang, and bring me here in five minutes the bloody circlet from herhair."Then, and then for the first time, I believed the planet was hauntedindeed, and I myself unknowingly under some strange and watchful&nbsp; influence. Spirits, demons! Oh! what but some incomprehensiblepower, some unseen influence shap- ing my efforts to its ends, could havemoved that hairy barbarian to play a second time into my hands like this,to choose from the endless records of his world the second of the twoincidents I had touched in hasty travel through it? I was almost overcomefor a minute; then, pulling myself together, strode forward fiercely, and,speaking so that all could hear me, cried, "Base king, who neither knowsthe capacities of a spirit nor has learned as yet to dread its anger, see! yourcommission is executed in a thought, just as your punishment might be.</p> 
<p>　　Heru, come here." And when the girl, speechless with amazement, hadrisen and slipped over to me, I straightened her pretty hair from her forehead, and then, in a way which would make my fortune if I could repeat itat a conjuror's table, whipped poor Yang's gemmy crown from my pocket,flashed its baleful splendour in the eyes of the courtiers, and placed it onthe tresses of the first royal lady who had worn it since its rightful ownerdied a hundred years before.</p> 
<p>　　A heavy silence fell on the hall as I finished, and nothing was heard fora time save Heru sobbing on my breast and a thirsty baby somewhereoutside calling to its mother for the water that was not to be had. Butpresently on those sounds came the fall of anxious feet, and a messenger,entering the doorway, approached the throne, laid him- self out flat twice,after which obeisance he proceeded to remind the king of the morning'sceremonial on a distant hill to "pray away the comet," telling his majestythat all was ready and the procession anxiously awaiting him.</p> 
<p>　　Whereon Ar-hap, obviously very well content to change the subject,rose, and, coming down from the dais, gave me his hand. He was a finefellow, as I have said, strong and bold, and had not behaved badly for anautocrat, so that I gripped his mighty fist with great pleasure.</p> 
<p>　　"I cannot deny, stranger," he said, "that you have done all that has beenasked of you, and the maid is fairly yours. Yet before you take away theprize I must have some as- surance of what you yourself will do with her.</p> 
<p>　　Therefore, for the moment, until this horrible thing in the sky whichthreatens my people with destruction has gone, let it be truce between us-you to your lodgings, and the princess back, unharmed, amongst my&nbsp; women till we meet again.""But--""No, no," said the king, waving his hand. "Be content with youradvantage. And now to business more important than ten thousand sillywenches," and gathering up his robes over his splendid war-gear the woodking stalked haughtily from the hall.</p>
