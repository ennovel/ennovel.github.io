It was a melancholy neighbourhood of low islands, overgrownwith rank grass and bushes, salt water encircling them, and inside sandydunes and hummocks with shallow pools, gleaming ghostly in theretreating daylight, while beyond these rose the black bosses of whatlooked like a forest. Thither I made my way, plunging uncomfortablythrough shallows, and tripping over blackened branches which, lying justbelow the surface, quivered like snakes as the evening breeze ruffled eachsurface, until the ground hardened under foot, and presently I was standing,hungry and faint but safe, on dry land again.</p> 
<p>　　The forest was so close to the sea, one could not advance withoutentering it, and once within its dark arcades every way looked equallygloomy and hopeless. I struggled through tangles night made more andmore impenetrable each min- ute, until presently I could go no further, andwhere a dense canopy of trees overhead gave out for a minute on the edgeof a swampy hollow, I determined to wait for daylight.</p> 
<p>　　Never was there a more wet or weary traveller, or one moredesperately lonely than he who wrapped himself up in the miserableinsufficiency of his wet rags, and without fire or supper crept amongst theexposed roots of a tree growing out of a bank, and prepared to hope grimlyfor morning.</p> 
<p>　　Round and round meanwhile was drawn the close screen of night, tillthe clearing in front was blotted out, and only the tree-tops, black asrugged hills one behind the other, stood out against the heavy purple of thecirclet of sky above. As the evening deepened the quaintest noises beganon every hand--noises so strange and bewildering that as I cowered downwith my teeth chattering, and stared hard into the impenetrable, they couldbe likened to nothing but the crying of all the souls of dead things sincethe beginning. Never was there such an infernal chorus as that whichplayed up the Martian stars. Down there in front, where hummock grasswas growing, some beast squeaked contin- uously, till I shouted at him,then he stopped a minute, and began again in entirely another note.</p> 
<p>　　Away on the hills two rival monsters were calling to each other in tones sohollow they seemed as I listened to penetrate through me, and echo out ofmy heart again. Far overhead, gigantic bats were flitting, the shadow oftheir wings dimming a dozen universes at once, and crying to each other inshrill tones that rent the air like tearing silk.</p> 
<p>　　As I listened to those vampires discussing their infernal loves underthe stars, from a branch right overhead broke such a deathly howl from thethroat of a wandering forest cat that everything else was hushed for amoment. All about a myriad insects were making night giddy with theirghostly fires, while underground and from the labyrinths of mat- ted rootscame quaint sounds of rustling snakes and forest pigs, and all the lesserthings that dig and scratch and growl.</p> 
<p>　　Yet I was desperately sleepy, my sword hung heavy as lead at my side,my eyelids drooped, and so at last I dozed uneasily for an hour or two.</p> 
<p>　　Then, all on a sudden, I came wide awake with a shock. The night wasquieter now; away in the forest depth strange noises still arose, but close athand was a strange hush, like the hush of expecta- tion, and, listeningwonderingly, I was aware of slow, heavy footsteps coming up from theriver, now two or three steps together, then a pause, then another step ortwo, and as I bent towards the approaching thing, staring into the darkness, my strained senses were conscious of another approach, as like ascould be, coming from behind me. On they came, making the veryground quake with their weight, till I judged that both were about on theedge of the clearing, two vast rat-like shadows, but as big as elephants,and bringing a most intolerable smell of sour slime with them. There, onthe edge of the amphitheatre, each for the first time ap- peared to becomeaware of the other's presence--the foot- steps stopped dead. I could hearthe water dripping from the fur of those giant brutes amongst the shadowsand the deep breathing of the one nearest me, a scanty ten paces off, butnot another sound in the stillness.</p> 
<p>　　Minute after minute passed, yet neither moved. A half- hour grew toa full hour, and that hour lengthened amid the keenest tension till my earsached with listening, and my eyes were sore with straining into theblackness. At last I began to wonder whether those earth-shaking beasts&nbsp; had not been an evil dream, and was just venturing to stretch out acramped leg, and rally myself upon my cowardice, when, without warning,at my elbow rose the most ear- piercing scream of rage that ever camefrom a living throat. There was a sweeping rush in the darkness which Icould feel but not see, and with a shock the two gladiators met in the midstof the arena. Over and over they went screaming and struggling, andslipping and plunging. I could hear them tearing at each other, and thesharp cries of pain, first one and then another gave as claw or tooth gothome, and all the time, though the ground was quaking under theirstruggles and the air full of horrible uproar, not a thing was to be seen. Idid not even know what manner of beasts they were who rocked androlled and tore at each other's throats, but I heard their teeth snapping, andtheir fierce breath in the pauses of the struggle, and could but wait in ahuddle amongst the roots until it was over. To and fro they went, now atthe far side of the dark clearing, now so close that hot drops of blood fromtheir jaws fell on my face like rain in the darkness. It seemed as thoughthe fight would never end, but presently there was more of worrying in itand less of snapping; it was clear one or the other had had enough and as Imarked this those black shad- ows came gasping and struggling towardsme. There was a sudden sharp cry, a desperate final tussle--before whichstrong trees snapped and bushes were flattened out like grass, not twentyyards away--and then for a minute all was silent.</p> 
<p>　　One of them had killed, and as I sat rooted to the spot I was forced tolisten while his enemy tore him up and ate him. Many a banquet have Ibeen at, but never an uglier one than that. I sat in the darkness while theunknown thing at my feet ripped the flesh from his half-dead rival in strips,and across the damp night wind came the reek of that abominable feast-the reek of blood and spilt en- trails--until I turned away my face inloathing, and was nearly starting to my feet to venture a rush into theforest shadows. But I was spellbound, and remained listening to theheavy munch of blood-stained jaws until presently I was aware other andlesser feasters were coming. There was a twinkle of hungry eyes allabout the limits of the area, the shine of green points of envious fire thatcircled round in decreasing orbits, as the little foxes and jackals came&nbsp; crowding in. One fellow took me for a rock, so still I sat, putting his hot,soft paws upon my knee for a space, and others passed me so near I couldall but touch them.</p> 
<p>　　The big beast had taken himself off by this time, and there must havebeen several hundreds of these newcomers. A merry time they had of it;the whole place was full of the green, hurrying eyes, and amidst the snapof teeth and yapping and quarrelling I could hear the flesh being torn fromthe red bones in every direction. One wolf-like individual brought amass of hot liver to eat between my feet, but I gave him a kick, and senthim away much to his surprise. Gradually, however, the sound of thisunholy feast died away, and, though you may hardly believe it, I fell offinto a doze. It was not sleep, but it served the purpose, and when in anhour or two a draught of cool air roused me, I awoke, feeling more myselfagain.</p> 
<p>　　Slowly morning came, and the black wall of forest around became fullof purple interstices as the east brightened. Those glimmers of lightbetween bough and trunk turned to yellow and red, the day-shine presentlystretched like a canopy from point to point of the treetops on either side ofmy sleeping-place, and I arose.</p> 
<p>　　All my limbs were stiff with cold, my veins emptied by hunger andwounds, and for a space I had not even strength to move. But a littlerubbing softened my cramped muscles presently and limping painfullydown to the place of combat, I surveyed the traces of that midnight fight.</p> 
<p>　　I will not dwell upon it. It was ugly and grim; the trampled grass, thegiant footmarks, each enringing its pool of cur- dled blood; the brokenbushes, the grooved mud-slides where the unknown brutes had slid indeadly embrace; the hollows, the splintered boughs, their ragged pointstufted with skin and hair--all was sickening to me. Yet so hungry was Ithat when I turned towards the odious remnants of the vanquished--ashapeless mass of abomination--my thou- ghts flew at once to breakfasting!</p> 
<p>　　I went down and in- spected the victim cautiously--a huge rat-like beast asfar as might be judged from the bare uprising ribs--all that was left of himlooking like the framework of a schooner yacht. His heart lay amongstthe offal, and my knife came out to cut a meal from it, but I could not do it.</p> 
<p>　　Three times I essayed the task, hunger and disgust contending for mastery;three times turned back in loathing. At last I could stand the sight nomore, and, slamming the knife up again, turned on my heels, and fairly ranfor fresh air and the shore, where the sea was beginning to glimmer in thelight a few score yards through the forest stems. There, once more out onthe open, on a pebbly beach, I stripped, spreading my things out to dry onthe stones, and laying myself down with the lapping of the waves in myears, and the first yellow sunshine thawing my limbs, tried to piecetogether the hurrying events of the last few days.</p> 
<p>　　What were my gay Martians doing? Lazy dogs to let me, a stranger,be the only one to draw sword in defence of their own princess! Wherewas poor Heru, that sweet maiden wife? The thought of her in the handsof the ape-men was odious. And yet was I not mad to try to rescue, oreven to follow her alone? If by any chance I could get off this beast-haunted place and catch up with the ravishers, what had I to look for fromthem except speedy extinction, and that likely enough by the most painfulprocess they were acquainted with?</p> 
<p>　　The other alternative of going back empty handed was terriblyignominious. I had lectured the amiable young manhood of Seth sosoundly on the subject of gallantry, and set them such a good example ontwo occasions, that it would be bathos to saunter back, hands in pockets,and con- fess I knew nothing of the lady's fate and had been daunted bythe first night alone in the forest. Besides, how dull it would be in thatbeautiful, tumble-down old city without Heru, with no expectation day byday of seeing her sylph-like form and hearing the merry tinkle of her fairylaughter as she scoffed at the unknown learning col- lected by herancestors in a thousand laborious years. No! I would go on for certain.</p> 
<p>　　I was young, in love, and angry, and before those qualifications difficultiesbecame light.</p> 
<p>　　Meanwhile, the first essential was breakfast of some kind. I arose,stretched, put on my half-dried clothes, and mount- ing a low hummock onthe forest edge looked around. The sun was riding up finely into the sky,and the sea to the eastward shone for leagues and leagues in the loveliestazure. Where it rippled on my own beach and those of the low islands&nbsp; noted over night, a wonderful fire of blue and red played on the sands asthough the broken water were full of living gems. The sky was full ofstrange gulls with long, forked tails, and a lovely little flying lizard withtransparent wings of the palest green--like those of a grass-hopper--wasflitting about picking up insect stragglers.</p> 
<p>　　All this was very charming, but what I kept saying to myself was"Streaky rashers and hot coffee: rashers and coffee and rolls," and, indeed,had the gates of Paradise themselves opened at that moment I fear my firstlook down the celestial streets within would have been for a restaurant.</p> 
<p>　　They did not, and I was just turning away disconsolate when my eyecaught, ascending from behind the next bluff down the beach, a thin strandof smoke rising into the morning air.</p> 
<p>　　It was nothing so much in itself--a thin spiral creeping upwards mast-high, then flattening out into a mushroom head--but it meant everything tome. Where there was fire there must be humanity, and where there washuman- ity--ay, to the very outlayers of the universe--there must bebreakfast. It was a splendid thought; I rushed down the hillock and wentgaily for that blue thread amongst the reeds. It was not two hundredyards away, and soon below me was a tiny bay with bluest water frilling asilver beach, and in the midst of it a fire on a hearth dancing round a potthat simmered gloriously. But of an owner there was nothing to be seen.</p> 
<p>　　I peered here and there on the shore, but nothing moved, while out to seathe water was shining like molten metal with not a dot upon it!--what didit matter? I laughed as, pleased and hungry, I slipped down the bank andstrode across the sands; it pleased Fate to play bandy with me, and if itsent me supperless to bed, why, here was restitution in the way ofbreakfast. I took up a morsel of the stuff in the kettle on a handy stick andfound it good--indeed, I knew it at once as a very dainty mess made fromthe roots of a herb the Martians great- ly liked; An had piled my platterwith it when we supped that night in the market-place of Seth, and thesweet white stuff had melted into my corporal essence, it seemed, without any gross intermediate process of digestion. And here I was again,hungry, sniffing the fragrant breath of a full meal and not a soul in sight--Ishould have been a fool not to have eaten. So thinking, down I sat,&nbsp; taking the pot from its place, and when it was a little cool plunging myhands into it and feasting with as good an appetite as ever a man hadbefore.</p> 
<p>　　It was gloriously ambrosial, and deeper and deeper I went, with the tallstalk of the smoke in front growing from the hearth-stones like somestrange new plant, the plea- sant sunshine on my back, and never a thoughtfor any- thing but the task in hand. Deeper and deeper, oblivious of allelse, until to get the very last drops I lifted the pipkin up and putting backmy head drank in that fashion.</p> 
<p>　　It was only when with a sigh of pleasure I lowered it slowly again thatover the rim as it sank there dawned upon me the vision of a Martianstanding by an empty canoe on the edge of the water and regarding mewith calm amaze- ment. I was, in fact, so astonished that for a minute theempty pot stood still before my face, and over its edge we stared at eachother in mute surprise, then with all the dig- nity that might be I laid thevessel down between my feet and waited for the newcomer to speak. Shewas a girl by her yellow garb, a fisherwoman, it seemed, for in the prow ofher craft was piled a net upon which the scales of fishes were twinkling--aMartian, obviously, but something more ro- bust than most of them, asavour of honest work about her sunburnt face which my pallid friendsaway yonder were lacking in, and when we had stared at each other for afew moments in silence she came forward a step or two and said without atrace of fear or shyness, "Are you a spirit, sir?</p> 
<p>　　"Why," I answered, "about as much, no more and no less, than most ofus.""Aye," she said. "I thought you were, for none but spirits live hereupon this island; are you for good or evil?""Far better for the breakfast of which I fear I have robbed you, butwandering along the shore and finding this pot boiling with no owner, Iventured to sample it, and it was so good my appetite got the better ofmanners."The girl bowed, and standing at a respectful distance asked if I wouldlike some fish as well; she had some, but not many, and if I would eat shewould cook them for me in a minute--it was not often, she added lightly,&nbsp; she had met one of my kind before. In fact, it was obvious that simpleperson did actually take me for a being of another world, and was it for meto say she was wrong? So adopt- ing a dignity worthy of my reputation Inodded gravely to her offer. She fetched from the boat four little fishesof the daintiest kind imaginable. They were each about as big as a handand pale blue when you looked down upon them, but so clear against thelight that every bone and vein in their bodies could be traced. Thesewere wrapped just as they were in a broad, green leaf and then the Martian,taking a pointed stick, made a hollow in the white ashes, laid them in sideby side, and drew the hot dust over again.</p> 
<p>　　While they cooked we chatted as though the acquaintance were themost casual thing in the world, and I found it was indeed an island wewere on and not the mainland, as I had hoped at first. Seth, she told me,was far away to the eastward, and if the woodmen had gone by in theirships they would have passed round to the north-west of where we were.</p> 
<p>　　I spent an hour or two with that amiable individual, and, it is to behoped, sustained the character of a spiritual visitant with considerabledignity. In one particular at least, that, namely, of appetite, I did honourto my supposed source, and as my entertainer would not hear of paymentin material kind, all I could do was to show her some conjuring tricks,which greatly increased her belief in my supernatural origin, and to teachher some new hitches and knots, using her fishing-line as a means ofillustration, a demonstration which called from her the natural observationthat we must be good sailors "up aloft" since we knew so much aboutcordage, then we parted.</p> 
<p>　　She had seen nothing of the woodmen, though she had heard they hadbeen to Seth and thought, from some niceties of geographical calculationwhich I could not follow, they would have crossed to the north, as juststated, of her island. There she told me, with much surprise at my desirefor the information, how I might, by following the forest track to thewestward coast, make my way to a fishing village, where they would giveme a canoe and direct me, since such was my extraordinary wish, to theplace where, if anywhere, the wild men had touched on their way home.</p> 
<p>　　She filled my wallet with dried honey-cakes and my mouth with sugar&nbsp; plums from her little store, then down on her knees went that poor waif ofa worn-out civilisation and kissed my hands in humble farewell, and I,blushing to be so saluted, and after all but a sailor, got her by the rosyfingers and lifted her up shoulder high, and getting one hand under herchin and the other behind her head kissed her twice upon her pretty cheeks;and so, I say, we parted.</p>
