<p>　　Was it a real feast we had shared in overnight, or only a quaint dream?</p> 
<p>　　Was Heru real or only a lovely fancy? And those hairy ruffians of whoma horrible vision danced before my waking eyes, were they fancy too?</p> 
<p>　　No, my wrists still ached with the strain of the tussle, the quaint, sad winetaste was still on my lips--it was all real enough, I decided, starting up inbed; and if it was real where was the little princess? What had they donewith her? Surely they had not given her to the ape-men--cowards thoughthey were they could not have been cowards enough for that. And as Iwondered a keen, bright picture of the hapless maid as I saw her lastblossomed before my mind's eye, the am- bassadors on either side holdingher wrists, and she shrink- ing from them in horror while her poor, whiteface turned to me for rescue in desperate pleading--oh! I must find her atall costs; and leaping from bed I snatched up those trousers without whichthe best of heroes is nothing, and had hardly got into them when therecame the patter of light feet without and a Martian, in a hurry for once,with half a dozen others behind him, swept aside the curtains of mydoorway.</p> 
<p>　　They peeped and peered all about the room, then one said, "Is PrincessHeru with you, sir?""No," I answered roughly. "Saints alive, man, do you think I wouldhave you tumbling in here over each other's heels if she were?""Then it must indeed have been Heru," he said, speak-ing in an awedvoice to his fellows, "whom we saw carried down to the harbour atdaybreak by yonder woodmen," and the pink upon their pretty cheeksfaded to nothing at the suggestion.</p> 
<p>　　"What!" I roared, "Heru taken from the palace by a handful of menand none of you infernal rascals--none of you white-livered abortionslifted a hand to save her--curse on you a thousand times. Out of my way,&nbsp; you churls!" And snatching up coat and hat and sword I rushed furiouslydown the long, marble stairs just as the short Martian night was givingplace to lavender-coloured light of morning. I found my way somehowdown the deserted corridors where the air was heavy with aromaticvapours; I flew by cur- tained niches and chambers where amongstmounds of half- withered flowers the Martian lovers were slowly waking.</p> 
<p>　　Down into the banquethall I sped, and there in the twilight was the litter ofthe feast still about--gold cups and silver, broken bread and meat, theconvolvulus flowers all turning their pallid faces to the rosy daylight,making pools of brightness between the shadows. Amongst the litterlittle sapphire-coloured finches were feeding, twittering merrily tothemselves as they hopped about, and here and there down the long tableslay asprawl a belated reveller, his empty oblivion-phial before him, hiscurly head upon his arms, dreaming perhaps of last night's feast and aneglected bride dozing dispassionate in some distant chamber. But Heruwas not there and little I cared for twittering finches or sighing damsels.</p> 
<p>　　With hasty feet I rushed down the hall out into the cool, sweet air of theplanet morning.</p> 
<p>　　There I met one whom I knew, and he told me he had been among thecrowd and had heard the woodmen had gone no farther than the river gate,that Heru was with them beyond a doubt. I would not listen to more.</p> 
<p>　　"Good!" I shouted. "Get me a horse and just a handful of your sleekkindred and we will pull the prize from the bear's paw even yet! Surely,"I said, turning to a knot of Martian youths who stood listening a few stepsaway, "surely some of you will come with me at this pinch? The bigbullies are very few; the sea runs behind them; the maid in their clutch isworth fighting for; it needs but one good onset, five minutes' gallantry, andshe is ours again. Think how fine it will look to bring her back beforeyon sleepy fellows have found their weapons. You, there, with the bluetunic! you look a proper fellow, and something of a heart should beatunder such gay wrappings, will you come with me?"But blue-mantle, biting his thumbs, murmured he had not breakfastedyet and edged away behind his com-panions. Wherever I looked eyesdropped and timid hands fidgeted as their owners backed off from my&nbsp; dangerous en- thusiasm. There was obviously no help to be had fromthem, and meantime the precious moments were flying, so with adisdainful glance I turned on my heels and set off alone as hard as I couldgo for the harbour.</p> 
<p>　　But it was too late. I rushed through the marketplace where all wassilent and deserted; I ran on to the wharves beyond and they were emptysave for the litter and embers of the fires Ar-hap's men had made duringtheir stay; I dashed out to the landing-place, and there at the hythe the lastboat- loads of the villains were just embarking, two boatloads of themtwenty yards from shore, and another still upon the beach. This latterwas careening over as a dusky group of men lifted aboard to a heap oftumbled silks and stuffs in the stern such a sweet piece of insensiblemerchandise as no man, I at least of all, could mistake. It was Heru herself, and the rogues were ladling her on board like so much sandal-woodor cotton sheeting. I did not wait for more, but out came my sword, andyielding to a reckless impulse, for which perhaps last night's wine was asmuch to blame as anything, I sprang down the steps and leapt aboard ofthe boat just as it was pushed off upon the swift tide. Full of Bersarkrage, I cut one brawny copper-coloured thief down, and struck anotherwith my fist between the eyes so that he went headlong into the water,sinking like lead, and deep into the great target of his neighbour's chest Idrove my blade. Had there been a man beside me, had there been buttwo or three of all those silken triflers, too late come on the terraces aboveto watch, we might have won. But all alone what could I do? That lastred beast turned on my blade, and as he fell dragged me half down withhim. I staggered up, and tugging the metal from him turned on the next.</p> 
<p>　　At that moment the cause of all the turmoil, roused by the fighting,came to herself, and sitting up on the piled plunder in the boat staredround for a moment with a child- ish horror at the barbarians whose prizeshe was, then at me, then at the dead man at my feet whose blood waswelling in a red tide from the wound in his breast. As the full meaning ofthe scene dawned upon her she started to her feet, looking wonderfullybeautiful amongst those dusky forms, and extending her hands to mebegan to cry in the most piteous way. I sprang forward, and as I did so&nbsp; saw an ape- man clap his hairy paw over her mouth and face--it was likean eclipse of the moon by a red earth-shadow, I thought at the moment-and drag her roughly back, but that was about the last I remembered. AsI turned to hit him standing on the slippery thwart, another rogue crept upbehind and let drive with a club he had in hand. The cud- gel caught mesideways on the head, a glancing shot. I can recall a blaze of light, astrange medley of sounds in my ears, and then, clutching at a pile of stuffsas I fell, a tall bower of spray rising on either hand, and the cool shock ofthe blue sea as I plunged headlong in--but noth- ing after that!</p> 
<p>　　How long after I know not, but presently a tissue of day- light creptinto my eyes, and I awoke again. It was better than nothing perhaps, yetit was a poor awakening. The big sun lay low down, and the day was allbut done; so much I guessed as I rocked in that light with an undulatingmovement, and then as my senses returned more fully, recognised with astart of wonder that I was still in the water, floating on a swift current intothe unknown on an air-filled pile of silken stuffs which had been pulleddown with me from the boat when I got my ganging from yonder rascal'smace. It was a wet couch, sodden and chilly, but as the fresheningevening wind blew on my face and the dark- ening water lapped againstmy forehead I revived more fully.</p> 
<p>　　Where had we come to? I turned an aching neck, and all along onboth sides seemed to stretch steep, straight coasts about a mile or so apart,in the shadow of the setting sun black as ebony. Between the two thehampered water ran quickly, with, away on the right, some shallow sandyspits and islands covered with dwarf bushes--chilly, inhospitable- lookingplaces they seemed as I turned my eyes upon them; but he who rideshelpless down an evening tide stands out for no great niceties of landing-place; could I but reach them they would make at least a drier bed thanthis of mine, and at that thought, turning over, I found all my muscles asstiff as iron, the sinews of my neck and forearms a mass of agonies and nomore fit to swim me to those reedy swamps, which now, as pain andhunger began to tell, seemed to wear the aspects of paradise.</p> 
<p>　　With a groan I dropped back upon my raft and watched the islandsslipping by, while over my feet the southern sky darkened to purple.</p> 
<p>　　There was no help there, but glanc- ing round away on the left and a fewfurlongs from me, I noticed on the surface of the water two convergingstrands of brightness, an angle the point of which seemed to be comingtowards me. Nearer it came and nearer, right across my road, until Icould see a black dot at the point, a head presently developed, then as weapproached the ears and antlers of a swimming stag. It was a huge beastas it loomed up against the glow, bigger than any mortal stag ever was--thekind of fellow-traveller no one would willingly accost, but even if I hadwished to get out of its path I had no power to do so.</p> 
<p>　　Closer and closer we came, one of us drifting helplessly, and the otherswimming strongly for the islands. When we were about a furlong apartthe great beast seemed to change its course, mayhap it took the wreckageon which I floated for an outlying shoal, something on which it could resta space in that long swim. Be this as it may, the beast came hurtlingdown on me lip deep in the waves, a mighty brown head with pricked earsthat flicked the water from them now and then, small bright eyes set farback, and wide palmated antlers on a mighty forehead, like the deadbranches of a tree. What that Martian mountain elk had hoped for canonly be guessed, what he met with was a tangle of floating finery carryinga numbed traveller on it, and with a snort of disappointment he turnedagain.</p> 
<p>　　It was a poor chance, but better than nothing, and as he turned I triedto throw a strand of silk I had unwound from the sodden mass over hisbranching tines. Quick as thought the beast twisted his head aside andtossed his antlers so that the try was fruitless. But was I to lose my onlychance of shore? With all my strength I hurled myself upon him, missingmy clutch again by a hair's-breadth and going head- long into the saltfurrow his chest was turning up. Happily I kept hold of the web, for thegreat elk then turned back, passing between me and the ruck of stuff andgetting thereby the silk under his chin, and as I came gasping to the toponce more round came that dainty wreckage over his back, and I clutchedit, and sooner than it takes to tell I was towing to the shore as perhaps noone was ever towed before.</p> 
<p>　　The big beast dragged the ruck like withered weed be- hind him,&nbsp; bellowing all the time with a voice which made the hills echo all round;and then, when he got his feet upon the shallows, rose dripping andmountainous, a very cliff of black hide and limb against the night shine,and with a single sweep of his antlers tore the webbing from me, who layprone and breathless in the mud, and, thinking it was his enemy, hurled thelimp bundle on the beach, and then, having pounded it with his cloven feetinto formless shreds, bellowed again victoriously and went off into thedark- ness of the forests.</p>
