<p>　　So I had a bath and a swim, a breakfast, and, to my shame be itacknowledged, a sort of farewell merry-go- round dance on the yellowsands with a dozen young persons all light-hearted as the morning,beautiful as the flowers that bound their hair, and in the extremity ofstatuesque attire.</p> 
<p>　　Then at last I got them to give me a sea-going canoe, a stock of cakesand fresh water; and with many parting in- junctions how to find theWoodman trail, since I would not listen to reason and lie all the rest of mylife with them in the sunshine, they pushed me off on my lonely voyage.</p> 
<p>　　"Over the blue waters!" they shouted in chorus as I dipped my paddleinto the diamond-crested wavelets. "Six hours, adventurous stranger,with the sun behind you! Then into the broad river behind the yellowsand-bar. But not the black northward river! Not the strong, black river,above all things, stranger! For that is the River of the Dead, by whichmany go but none come back. Goodbye!" And waving them adieu, Isternly turned my eyes from delights behind and faced the fascination ofperils in front.</p> 
<p>　　In four hours (for the Martians had forgotten in their calculations thatmy muscles were something better than theirs) I "rose" the further shore,and then the question was, Where ran that westward river of theirs?</p> 
<p>　　It turned out afterwards that, knowing nothing of their tides, I haddrifted much too far to northward, and con- sequently the coast had closedup the estuary mouth I should have entered. Not a sign of an openingshowed any-where, and having nothing whatever for guidance I turnednorthward, eagerly scanning an endless line of low cliffs, as the daylessened, for the promised sand-bar or inlet.</p> 
<p>　　About dusk my canoe, flying swiftly forward at its own sweet will,brought me into a bight, a bare, desolate-looking country with novegetation save grass and sedge on the near marshes and stony hills rising&nbsp; up beyond, with others beyond them mounting step by step to a long lineof ridges and peaks still covered in winter snow.</p> 
<p>　　The outlook was anything but cheering. Not a trace of habitation hadbeen seen for a long time, not a single living being in whoseneighbourhood I could land and ask the way; nothing living anywhere buta monstrous kind of sea- slug, as big as a dog, battening on the watersidegarbage, and gaunt birds like vultures who croaked on the mud-flats, andhalf-spread wings of funereal blackness as they gam- bolled here and there.</p> 
<p>　　Where was poor Heru? Where pink- shouldered An? Where those wildmen who had taken the princess from us? Lastly, but not least, wherewas I?</p> 
<p>　　All the first stars of the Martian sky were strange to me, and my boatwhirling round and round on the current con- fused what little geography Imight otherwise have retained. It was a cheerless look out, and again andagain I cursed my folly for coming on such a fool's errand as I sat, chin inhand, staring at a landscape that grew more and more de- pressing everymile. To go on looked like destruction, to go back was almost impossiblewithout a guide; and while I was still wondering which of the two mightbe the lesser evil, the stream I was on turned a corner, and in a moment wewere upon water which ran with swift, oily smoothness straight for thesnow-ranges now beginning to loom un- pleasantly close ahead.</p> 
<p>　　By this time the night was coming on apace, the last of the evil-looking birds had winged its way across the red sunset glare, and though itwas clear enough in mid-river under the banks, now steep and unclimbable,it was already evening.</p> 
<p>　　And with the darkness came a wondrous cold breath from off the ice-fields, blowing through my lowland wrap- pings as though they were buttissue. I munched a bit of honey-cake, took a cautious sip of wine, andthough I will not own I was frightened, yet no one will deny that the circumstances were discouraging.</p> 
<p>　　Standing up in the frail canoe and looking around, at the second glancean object caught my eye coming with the stream, and rapidly overtakingme on a strong sluice of water. It was a raft of some sort, and somethingextra- ordinarily like a sitting Martian on it! Nearer and nearer it came,&nbsp; bobbing to the rise and fall of each wavelet with the last icy sunlighttouching it up with reds and golds, nearer and nearer in the deadly hush ofthat forsaken region, and then at last so near it showed quite plainly on thepurple water, a raft with some one sitting under a canopy.</p> 
<p>　　With a thrill of delight I waved my cap aloft and shouted-"Ship-ahoy! Hullo, messmate, where are we bound to?"But never an answer came from that swiftly-passing stranger, so againI hailed-"Put up your helm, Mr. Skipper; I have lost my bearings, and thechronometer has run down," but without a pause or sound that strangecraft went slipping by.</p> 
<p>　　That silence was more than I could stand. It was against all seacourtesies, and the last chance of learning where I was passing away. So,angrily the paddle was snatched from the canoe bottom, and roaring outagain-"Stop, I say, you d----- lubber, stop, or by all the gods I will makeyou!" I plunged the paddle into the water and shot my little craftslantingly across the stream to inter-cept the newcomer. A single strokesent me into mid-stream, a second brought me within touch of that strangecraft. It was a flat raft, undoubtedly, though so disguised by flowers andsilk trailers that its shape was difficult to make out. In the centre was achair of ceremony bedecked with greenery and great pale buds, hardly yetwithered--oh, where had I seen such a chair and such a raft before?</p> 
<p>　　And the riddle did not long remain unanswered. Upon that seat, as Iswept up alongside and laid a sunburnt hand upon its edge, was a girl, andanother look told me she was dead!</p> 
<p>　　Such a sweet, pallid, Martian maid, her fair head lolling back againstthe rear of the chair and gently moving to and fro with the rise and fall ofher craft. Her face in the pale light of the evening like carved ivory, andnot less passion- less and still; her arms bare, and her poor fingers stillclosed in her lap upon the beautiful buds they had put into them. I fairlygasped with amazement at the dreadful sweetness of that solitary lady, andcould hardly believe she was really a corpse! But, alas! there was nodoubt of it, and I stared at her, half in admiration and half in fear; noting&nbsp; how the last sunset flush lent a hectic beauty to her face for a moment, andthen how fair and ghostly she stood out against the purpling sky; how herlight drapery lifted to the icy wind, and how dreadfully strange all thosesoft- scented flowers and trappings seemed as we sped along side by sideinto the country of night and snow.</p> 
<p>　　Then all of a sudden the true meaning of her being there burst upon me,and with a start and a cry I looked around. WE WERE FLYINGSWIFTLY DOWN THAT RIVER OF THE DEAD THEY HAD TOLDME OF THAT HAS NO OUTLET AND NO RETURNING!</p> 
<p>　　With frantic haste I snatched up a paddle again and tried to paddleagainst the great black current sweeping us for- ward. I worked until theperspiration stood in beads on my forehead, and all the time I worked theriver, like some black snake, hissed and twined, and that pretty lady rodecheerily along at my side. Overhead stars of unearthly bril- liancy werecoming out in the frosty sky, while on either hand the banks were high andthe shadows under them black as ink. In those shadows now and then Inoticed with a horrible indifference other rafts were travelling, andpresently, as the stream narrowed, they came out and joined us, deadMartians, budding boys and girls; older voyagers with their agequickening upon them in the Martian manner, just as some fruit onlyripens after it falls; yellow-girt slaves staring into the night in front, quite amerry crew all clustered about I and that gentle lady, and more far aheadand more behind, all bobbing and jostling forward as we hurried to thedreadful graveyard in the Martian re- gions of eternal winter none had everseen and no one came to! I cried aloud in my desolation and fear and hidmy face in my hands, while the icy cliffs mocked my cry and the deadmaid, tripping alongside, rolled her head over, and stared at me with stony,unseeing eyes.</p> 
<p>　　Well, I am no fine writer. I sat down to tell a plain, un- varnished tale,and I will not let the weird horror of that ride get into my pen. Wecareened forward, I and those lost Martians, until pretty near on midnight,by which time the great light-giving planets were up, and never a chancedid Fate give me all that time of parting company with them. Aboutmidnight we were right into the region of snow and ice, not the actual&nbsp; polar region of the planet, as I afterwards guessed, but one of those longoutliers which follow the course of the broad waterways almost into fertileregions, and the cold, though intense, was somewhat modified by thecomplete stillness of the air.</p> 
<p>　　It was just then that I began to be aware of a low, rum- bling soundahead, increasing steadily until there could not be any doubt the journeywas nearly over and we were approaching those great falls An had told meof, over which the dead tumble to perpetual oblivion. There was no opportunity for action, and, luckily, little time for thought. I rememberclapping my hand to my heart as I muttered an im- perfect prayer, andlaughing a little as I felt in my pocket, between it and that organ, anenvelope containing some corn-plaster and a packet of unpaid tailors' bills.</p> 
<p>　　Then I pulled out that locket with poor forgotten Polly's photo- graph, andwhile I was still kissing it fervently, and the dead girl on my right wasjealously nudging my canoe with the corner of her raft, we plunged into anarrow gully as black as hell, shot round a sharp corner at a tremendouspace, and the moment afterwards entered a lake in the midst of anunbroken amphitheatre of cliffs gleaming in soft light all round.</p> 
<p>　　Even to this moment I can recall the blue shine of those terrible icecrags framing the weird picture in on every hand, and the strange effectupon my mind as we passed out of the darkness of the gully down whichwe had come into the sepulchral radiance of that place. But though itfixed with one instantaneous flash its impression on my mind forever,there was no time to admire it. As we swept on to the lake's surface, anda glance of light coming over a dip in the ice walls to the left lit up thedead faces and half- withered flowers of my fellow-travellers withstartling dis-tinctness, I noticed with a new terror at the lower end of thelake towards which we were hurrying the water suddenly disappeared in acloud of frosty spray, and it was from thence came the low, ominousrumble which had sounded up the ravine as we approached. It was thefall, and beyond the stream dropped down glassy step after step, in wildpools and rapids, through which no boat could live for a moment, to ablack cavern entrance, where it was swal- lowed up in eternal night.</p> 
<p>　　I WOULD not go that way! With a yell such as those solitudes had&nbsp; probably never heard since the planet was fashioned out of the void, Iseized the paddle again and struck out furiously from the main current,with the result of post- poning the crisis for a time, and finding myselfbobbing round towards the northern amphitheatre, where the light fellclearest from planets overhead. It was like a great ball- room with thoseconstellations for tapers, and a ghastly crowd of Martians were doingcotillions and waltzes all about me on their rafts as the troubled water, icycold and clear as glass, eddied us here and there in solemn con- fusion.</p> 
<p>　　On the narrow beaches at the cliff foot were hundreds of wreckedvoyagers--the wall-flowers of that ghostly as- sembly-room--and I wentjostling and twirling round the circle as though looking for a likely partner,until my brain spun and my heart was sick.</p> 
<p>　　For twenty minutes Fate played with me, and then the deadly suck ofthe stream got me down again close to where the water began to race forthe falls. I vowed sav- agely I would not go over them if it could behelped, and struggled furiously.</p> 
<p>　　On the left, in shadow, a narrow beach seemed to lie between the waterand the cliff foot; towards it I fought. At the very first stroke I fouled araft; the occupant thereof came tumbling aboard and nearly swamped me.</p> 
<p>　　But now it was a fight for life, so him I seized without ceremony byclammy neck and leg and threw back into the water. Then another playfulMartian butted the behind part of my canoe and set it spinning, so that allthe stars seemed to be dancing giddily in the sky. With a yell I shovedhim off, but only to find his comrades were closing round me in a solidring as we sucked down to the abyss at ever- increasing speed.</p> 
<p>　　Then I fought like a fury, hacking, pushing, and paddling shorewards,crying out in my excitement, and spinning and bumping and twisting everdownwards. For every foot I gained they pushed me on a yard, as thoughdetermined their fate should be mine also.</p> 
<p>　　They crowded round me in a compact circle, their poor flower-girtheads nodding as the swift current curtsied their crafts. They hemmedme in with desperate persistency as we spun through the ghostly starlightin a swirling mass down to destruction! And in a minute we were soclose to the edge of the fall I could see the water break into ridges as it felt&nbsp; the solid bottom give way under it. We were so close that already theforemost rafts, ten yards ahead, were tipping and their occupants one byone waving their arms about and tumbling from their funeral chairs as theyshot into the spray veil and went out of sight under a faint rainbow thatwas arched over there, the symbol of peace and the only lovely thing inthat gruesome region. Another minute and I must have gone with them.</p> 
<p>　　It was too late to think of getting out of the tangle then; the water behindwas heavy with trailing silks and flowers. We were jammed togetheralmost like one huge float and in that latter fact lay my one chance.</p> 
<p>　　On the left was a low ledge of rocks leading back to the narrow beachalready mentioned, and the ledge came out to within a few feet of wherethe outmost boat on that side would pass it. It was the only chance and apoor one, but already the first rank of my fleet was trembling on the brink,and without stopping to weigh matters I bounded off my own canoe on tothe raft alongside, which rocked with my weight like a tea-tray. Fromthat I leapt, with such hearty good-will as I had never had before, on to asecond and third. I jumped from the footstool of one Martian to the kneeof another, steadying myself by a free use of their nodding heads as Ipassed. And every time I jumped a ship collapsed behind me. As Istaggered with my spring into the last and outermost boat the ledge wasstill six feet away, half hidden in a smother of foam, and the rim of thegreat fall just under it. Then I drew all my sailor agility together and justas the little vessel was going bow up over the edge I leapt from her--camedown blinded with spray on the ledge, rolled over and over, clutchedfrantically at the frozen soil, and was safe for the moment, but only a fewinches from the vortex below!</p> 
<p>　　As soon as I picked myself up and got breath, I walked shorewardsand found, with great satisfaction, that the ledge joined the shelving beach,and so walked on in the blue obscurity of the cliff shadow back from thefalls in the bare hope that the beach might lead by some way into the gullythrough which we had come and open country beyond. But after a coupleof hundred yards this hope ended as abruptly as the spit itself in deepwater, and there I was, as far as the darkness would allow me to ascertain,as utterly trapped as any mortal could be.</p> 
<p>　　I will not dwell on the next few minutes, for no one likes toacknowledge that he has been unmanned even for a space. When thoseminutes were over calmness and con- sideration returned, and I was ableto look about.</p> 
<p>　　All the opposite cliffs, rising sheer from the water, were in light, theircold blue and white surfaces rising far up into the black starfieldsoverhead. Looking at them intently from this vantage-point I sawwithout at first understanding that along them horizontally, tier above tier,were rows of objects, like--like--why, good Heavens, they were like menand women in all sorts of strange postures and positions! Rubbing my eyesand looking again I perceived with a start and a strange creepy feelingdown my back that they WERE men and women!--hundreds of them,thousands, all in rows as cormorants stand upon sea-side cliffs, myriadsand myriads now I looked about, in every conceivable pose and attitudebut never a sound, never a movement amongst the vast concourse.</p> 
<p>　　Then I turned back to the cliffs behind me. Yes! they ere there too,dimmer by reason of the shadows, but there for certain, from thesnowfields far above down, down--good Heavens! to the very level whereI stood. There was one of them not ten yards away half in and half out ofthe ice wall, and setting my teeth I walked over and examined him. Andthere was another further in behind as I peered into the clear blue depth,another behind that one, another behind him--just like cherries in a jelly.</p> 
<p>　　It was startling and almost incredible, yet so many wonderful thingshad happened of late that wonders were losing their sharpness, and I wassoon examining the cliff almost as coolly as though it were only sometrivial geo- logical "section," some new kind of petrified sea-urchinswhich had caught my attention and not a whole nation in ice, a hugeamphitheatre of fossilised humanity which stared down on me.</p> 
<p>　　The matter was simple enough when you came to look at it withphilosophy. The Martians had sent their dead down here for manythousand years and as they came they were frozen in, the bands and zonesin which they sat indicating perhaps alternating seasons. Then afterNature had been storing them like that for long ages some up- heavalhappened, and this cleft and lake opened through the heart of the preserve.</p> 
<p>　　Probably the river once ran far up there where the starlight was crowningthe blue cliffs with a silver diadem of light, only when this hollow openeddid it slowly deepen a lower course, spreading out in a lake, andeventually tumbling down those icy steps lose itself in the dark roots ofthe hills. It was very simple, no doubt, but incredibly weird andwonderful to me who stood, the sole living thing in that immenseconcourse of dead humanity.</p> 
<p>　　Look where I would it was the same everywhere. Those endlessrows of frozen bodies lying, sitting, or standing stared at me from everyniche and cornice. It almost seemed, as the light veered slowly round, asthough they smiled and frowned at times, but never a word was thereamongst those millions; the silence itself was audible, and save the dulllow thunder of the fall, so monotonous the ear be- came accustomed toand soon disregarded it, there was not a sound anywhere, not a rustle, nota whisper broke the eternal calm of that great caravansary of the dead.</p> 
<p>　　The very rattle of the shingle under my feet and the jingle of my navyscabbard seemed offensive in the perfect hush, and, too awed to befrightened, I presently turned away from the dreadful shine of those cliffsand felt my way along the base of the wall on my own side. There wasno means of escape that way, and presently the shingle beach itself gaveout as stated, where the cliff wall rose straight from the surface of the lake,so I turned back, and finding a grotto in the ice determined to make myselfas comfortable as might be until daylight came.</p>
