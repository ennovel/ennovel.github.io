<p>　　As for the people, they were delighted to have their princess back, butwith the delight of children, fawning about her, singing, clapping hands,yet asking no questions as to where she had been, showing no appreciationof our adventures--a serious offence in my eyes--and, perhaps mostimportant of all, no understanding of what I may call the political bearingsof Heru's restoration, and how far their arch enemies beyond the sea mightbe inclined to attempt her recovery.</p> 
<p>　　They were just delighted to have the princess back, and that was theend of it. Theirs was the joy of a vast nursery let loose. Flowerprocessions were organised, garlands woven by the mile, a general orderissued that the nation might stay up for an hour after bedtime, and in thevortex of that gentle rejoicing Heru was taken from me, and I saw her nomore, till there happened the wildest scene of all you have shared with meso patiently.</p> 
<p>　　Overlooked, unthanked, I turned sulky, and when this mood, one I cannever maintain for long, wore off, I threw myself into the dissipation aboutme with angry zeal. I am frankly ashamed of the confession, but I was "asailor ashore," and can only claim the indulgences proper to the situation.</p> 
<p>　　I laughed, danced, drank, through the night; I drank deep of a dozen rosyways to forgetfulness, till my mind was a great confusion, full of flittingpictures of love- liness, till life itself was an illusive pantomime, and mywill but thistle-down on the folly of the moment. I drank with thosegentle roisterers all through their starlit night, and if we stopped whenmorning came it was more from weariness than virtue. Then the yellow-robed slaves gave us the wine of recovery--alas! my faithful An was notamongst them-- and all through the day we lay about in sodden happiness.</p> 
<p>　　Towards nightfall I was myself again, not unfortunately with theheadache well earned, but sufficiently remorseful to be in a vein to makegood resolutions for the future.</p> 
<p>　　In this mood I mingled with a happy crowd, all purpose- less and&nbsp; cheerful as usual, but before long began to feel the influence of one ofthose drifts, a universal turning in one direction, as seaweed turns whenthe tide changes, so char- acteristic of Martian society. It was dusk, alovely soft velvet dusk, but not dark yet, and I said to a yellow-robed fairyat my side:</p> 
<p>　　"Whither away, comrade? It is not eight bells yet. Surely we arenot going to be put to bed so early as this?""No," said that smiling individual, "it is the princess. We are going tolisten to Princess Heru in the palace square. She reads the globe on theterrace again tonight, to see if omens are propitious for her marriage.</p> 
<p>　　She MUST marry, and you know the ceremony has been unavoidablypostponed so far.""Unavoidably postponed?" Yes, Heaven wotted I was aware of thefact. And was Heru going to marry black Hath in such a hurry? Andafter all I had done for her? It was scarcely decent, and I tried to rousemyself to rage over it, but somehow the seductive Martian contentmentwith any fate was getting into my veins. I was not yet altogether sunk intheir slothful acceptance of the inevitable, but there was not the slightestdoubt the hot red blood in me was turn- ing to vapid stuff such as did dutyfor the article in their veins. I mustered up a half-hearted frown at thisunwelcome intelligence, turning with it on my face towards the slave girl;but she had slipped away into the throng, so the frown evaporated, andshrugging my shoulders I said to myself, "What does it matter? Thereare twenty others will do as well for me. If not one, why then obviouslyan- other, 'tis the only rational way to think, and at all events there is themagic globe. That may tell us something." And slipping my arm roundthe waist of the first disengaged girl--we were not then, mind you, inAtlantic City--I kissed her dimpling cheek unreproached, and gailyfollowed in the drift of humanity, trending with a low hum of pleasuretowards the great white terraces under the palace porch.</p> 
<p>　　How well I knew them! It was just such an evening Heru hadconsulted Fate in the same place once before; how much had happenedsince then! But there was little time or in- clination to think of thosethings now. The whole phantom city's population had drifted to one&nbsp; common centre. The crumbling seaward ramparts were all deserted; nosoldier watch was kept to note if angry woodmen came from over seas; asoft wind blew in from off the brine, but told no tales; the streets wereempty, and, when as we waited far away in the southern sky the earthplanet presently got up, by its light Heru, herself again, came trippingdown the steps to read her fate.</p> 
<p>　　They had placed another magic globe under a shroud on a tripod forher. It stood within the charmed circle upon the terrace, and I was closeby, although the princess did not see me.</p> 
<p>　　Again that weird, fantastic dance commenced, the princess workingherself up from the drowsiest undulations to a hur- ricane of emotion.</p> 
<p>　　Then she stopped close by the orb, and seized the corner of the webcovering it. We saw the globe begin to beam with veiled magnificence ather touch.</p> 
<p>　　Not an eye wavered, not a thought wandered from her in all that silentmultitude. It was a moment of the keenest suspense, and just when it wasat its height there came a strange sound of hurrying feet behind theoutermost crowd, a murmur such as a great pack of wolves might makerushing through snow, while a soft long wail went up from the darkness.</p> 
<p>　　Whether Heru understood it or not I cannot say, but she hesitated amoment, then swept the cloth from the orb of her fate.</p> 
<p>　　And as its ghostly, self-emitting light beamed up in the darkness withweird brilliancy, there by it, in gold and furs and war panoply, huge, fierce,and lowering, stood--AR-HAP HIMSELF!</p> 
<p>　　Ay, and behind him, towering over the crouching Mar- tians, blockingevery outlet and street, were scores and hundreds of his men. Never wassurprise so utter, ambush more complete. Even I was transfixed withastonishment, staring with open-mouthed horror at the splendid figure ofthe barbarian king as he stood aglitter in the ruddy light, scowling defianceat the throng around him. So silently had he come on his errand ofvengeance it was difficult to be- lieve he was a reality, and not some cleverpiece of stageplay, some vision conjured up by Martian necromancy.</p> 
<p>　　But he was good reality. In a minute comedy turned to tragedy. Arhap gave a sign with his hand, whereon all his men set up a terrible warcry,&nbsp; the like of which Seth had not heard for very long, and as far as I couldmake out in the half light began hacking and hewing my luckless friendswith all their might. Meanwhile the king made at Heru, feeling sure ofher this time, and doubtless intending to make her taste his vengeance tothe dregs; and seeing her handled like that, and hearing her plaintive cries,wrath took the place of stupid surprise in me. I was on my feet in asecond, across the intervening space, and with all my force gave the king ablow upon the jaw which sent even him staggering backwards. Before Icould close again, so swift was the sequence of events in those flyingminutes, a wild mob of people, victims and executioners in one disorderedthrong, was between us. How the king fared I know not, nor stopped toask, but half dragging, half carrying Heru through the shrieking mob, gother up the palace steps and in at the great doors, which a couple of yellow-clad slaves, more frightened of the barbarians than thoughtful of the crowdwithout, promptly clapped to, and shot the bolts. Thus we were safe for amoment, and putting the princess on a couch, I ran up a short flight ofstairs and looked out of a front window to see if there were a chance ofsuccouring those in the palace square. But it was all hopeless chaos withthe town already beginning to burn and not a show of fight anywherewhich I could join.</p> 
<p>　　I glared out on that infernal tumult for a moment or two in an agony ofimpotent rage, then turned towards the harbour and saw in the shine of theburning town below the ancient battlements and towers of Seth begin togleam out, like a splendid frost work of living metal clear-cut against thesmooth, black night behind, and never a show of resistance there either.</p> 
<p>　　Ay, and by this time Ar-hap's men were battering in our gates with a bigbeam, and somehow, I do not know how it happened, the palace itselfaway on the right, where the dry-as-dust library lay, was also beginning toburn.</p> 
<p>　　It was hopeless outside, and nothing to be done but to save Heru, sodown I went, and, with the slaves, carried her away from the hall througha vestibule or two, and into an anteroom, where some yellow-girtindividuals were al- ready engaged in the suggestive work of tying up palace plate in bundles, amongst other things, alas! the great gold love-bowl&nbsp; from which--oh! so long ago--I had drawn Heru's marriage billet. Theseindividuals told me in tremulous accents they had got a boat on a secretwaterway behind the palace whence flight to the main river and so, faraway inland, to another smaller but more peaceful city of their race wouldbe quite practical; and joyfully hearing this news, I handed over to themthe princess while I went to look for Hath.</p> 
<p>　　And the search was not long. Dashing into the banquet-hall, stilllittered with the remains of a feast, and looking down its deserted vistas,there at the farther end, on his throne, clad in the sombre garments heaffected, chin on hand, sedate in royal melancholy, listening unmoved tothe sack of his town outside, sat the prince himself. Strange, gloomyman, the great dead intelligence of his race shining in his face as weirdand out of place as a lonely sea beacon fading to nothing before the glowof sunrise, never had he appeared so mysterious as at that moment. Evenin the heat of excitement I stared at him in amazement, wishing in a hastythought the confusion of the past few weeks had given me opportun- ity topenetrate the recesses of his mind, and therefrom retell you things betterworth listening to than all the incident of my adventures. But now therewas no time to think, scarce time to act.</p> 
<p>　　"Hath!" I cried, rushing over to him, "wake up, your majesty. TheThither men are outside, killing and burning!""I know it.""And the palace is on fire. You can smell the reek even here.""Yes.""Then what are you going to do?""Nothing.""My word, that is a fine proposition for a prince! If you care nothingfor town or palace perhaps you will bestir yourself for Princess Heru."A faint glimmer of interest rose upon the alabaster calm of his face atthat name, but it faded instantly, and he said quietly,"The slaves will save her. She will live. I looked into the book ofher fate yesterday. She will escape, and forget, and sit at anothermarriage feast, and be a mother, and give the people yet one more princeto keep the faint glimmer of our ancestry alive. I am content.""But, d--- it, man, I am not! I take a deal more in- terest in the younglady than you seem to, and have scoured half this precious planet of yourson her account, and will be hanged if I sit idly twiddling my thumbs whileher pretty skin is in danger." But Hath was lost in contempla- tion of hisshoe-strings.</p> 
<p>　　"Come, sir," I said, shaking his majesty by the shoulder, "don't bedown on your luck. There has been some rivalry between us, but nevermind about that just now. The prin- cess wants you. I am going to saveboth her and you, you must come with her.""No.""But you SHALL come.""No!"By this time the palace was blazing like a bonfire and the uproaroutside was terrible. What was I to do? As I hesitated the arras at thefurther end of the hall was swept aside, a disordered mob of slaves bearingbundles and drag- ging Heru with them rushing down to the door near us.</p> 
<p>　　As Heru was carried swiftly by she stretched her milk-white arms towardsthe prince and turned her face, lovely as a convolvulus flower even in itspallor, upon him.</p> 
<p>　　It was a heart-moving appeal from a woman with the heart of a child,and Hath rose to his feet while for a mo- ment there shone a look ofresponsible manhood in his eyes. But it faded quickly; he bowed slowly asthough he had received an address of condolence on the condition of hisempire, and the next moment the frightened slaves, stumbling under theirburdens, had swept poor Heru through the doorway.</p> 
<p>　　I glanced savagely round at the curling smoke overhead, the redtendrils of fire climbing up a distant wall, and there on a table by us was ahalf-finished flask of the lovely tinted wine of forgetfulness. If Hathwould not come sober perhaps he might come drunk.</p> 
<p>　　"Here," I cried, "drink to tomorrow, your majesty, a sov- ereign toast inall ages, and better luck next time with these hairy gentlemen battering atyour majesty's doors," and splashing out a goblet full of the stuff I handedit to him.</p> 
<p>　　He took it and looked rather lovingly into the limpid pool, then&nbsp; deliberately poured it on the step in front of him, and throwing the cupaway said pleasantly,"Not tonight, good comrade; tonight I drink a deeper draught ofoblivion than that,--and here come my cup- bearers."Even while he spoke the palace gates had given way; there was ahorrible medley of shrieks and cries, a quick sound of running feet; thenagain the arras lifted and in poured a horde of Ar-hap's men-at-arms. Themoment they caught sight of us about a dozen of them, armed with bows,drew the thick hide strings to their ears and down the hall came a raveningflight of shafts. One went through my cap, two stuck quivering in thethrone, and one, winged with owl feather, caught black Hath full in thebosom.</p> 
<p>　　He had stood out boldly at the first coming of that onset, arms crossedon breast, chin up, and looking more of a gentleman than I had ever seenhim look before; and now, stricken, he smiled gravely, then withoutflinching, and still eyeing his enemies with gentle calm, his knees unlocked, his frame trembled, then down he went headlong, his red bloodrunning forth in rivulets amongst the wine of oblivion he had just pouredout.</p> 
<p>　　There was no time for sentiment. I shrugged my shoulders, andturning on my heels, with the woodmen close after me, sprang through thenear doorway. Where was Heru? I flew down the corridor by which itseemed she had re- treated, and then, hesitating a moment where it dividedin two, took the left one. This to my chagrin presently began to trendupwards, whereas I knew Heru was making for the river down below.</p> 
<p>　　But it was impossible to go back, and whenever I stopped in thosedeserted passages I could hear the wolflike patter of men's feet upon mytrail. On again into the stony laby- rinths of the old palace, ever upwards,in spite of my desire to go down, until at last, the pursuers off the track fora moment, I came to a north window in the palace wall, and, hot andbreathless, stayed to look out.</p> 
<p>　　All was peace here; the sky a lovely lavender, a promise of comingmorning in it, and a gold-spangled curtain of stars out yonder on thehorizon. Not a soul moved. Below appeared a sheer drop of a hundred&nbsp; feet into a moat wind- ing through thickets of heavy-scented convolvulusflowers to the waterways beyond. And as I looked a skiff with half adozen rowers came swiftly out of the darkness of the wall and passed likea shadow amongst the thickets. In the prow was all Hath's wedding plate,and in the stern, a faint vision of unconscious loveliness, lay Heru!</p> 
<p>　　Before I could lift a finger or call out, even if I had had a mind to do so,the shadow had gone round a bend, and a shout within the palace told me Iwas sighted again.</p> 
<p>　　On once more, hotly pursued, until the last corridor ended in two doorsleading into a half-lit gallery with open win-dows at the further end.</p> 
<p>　　There was a wilderness of lumber down the sides of the great garret, andnow I come to think of it more calmly I imagine it was Hath's LostProperty Office, the vast receptacle where his slaves deposited everythinglazy Martians forgot or left about in their daily life. At that moment itonly represented a last refuge, and into it I dashed, swung the doors to andfastened them just as the foremost of Ar-hap's men hurled themselvesupon the barrier from outside.</p> 
<p>　　There I was like a rat in a trap, and like a rat I made up my mind tofight savagely to the end, without for a mo- ment deceiving myself as towhat that end must be. Even up there the horrible roar of destruction wasplainly audible as the barbarians sacked and burned the ancient town, andI was glad from the bottom of my heart my poor little princess was safelyout of it. Nor did I bear her or hers the least resentment for making offwhile there was yet time and leaving me to my fate--anything else wouldhave been contrary to Martian nature. Doubtless she would get away, asHath had said, and elsewhere drop a few pearly tears and then over hersugar-candy and lotus-eating forget with happy completeness--mostblessed gift! And meanwhile the foresaid barbarians were battering onmy doors, while over their heads choking smoke was pouring in in everincreas- ing volumes.</p> 
<p>　　In burst the first panel, then another, and I could see through the gaps amedley of tossing weapons and wild faces without. Short shrift for me ifthey came through, so in the obstinacy of desperation I set to work to pileold furniture and dry goods against the barricade. And as they yelled and&nbsp; hammered outside I screamed back defiance from within, sweating,tugging, and hauling with the strength of ten men, piling up the oldMartian lumber against the opening till, so fierce was the attack outside,little was left of the original doorway and nothing between me and thebeseigers but a rampart of broken woodwork half seen in a smother ofsmoke and flames.</p> 
<p>　　Still they came on, thrusting spears and javelins through every creviceand my strength began to go. I threw two tables into a gap, and brained abesieger with a sweet- meat-seller's block and smothered another, andoverturned a great chest against my barricade; but what was the purpose ofit all? They were fifty to one and my rampart quaked before them. Thesmoke was stifling, and the pains of dis- solution in my heart. They burstin and clambered up the rampart like black ants. I looked round for stillone more thing to hurl into the breach. My eyes lit on a roll of carpet: Iseized it by one corner meaning to drag it to the door- way, and it cameundone at a touch.</p> 
<p>　　That strange, that incredible pattern! Where in all the vicissitudes ofa chequered career had I seen such a one before? I stared at it inamazement under the very spears of the woodmen in the red glare ofHath's burning palace. Then all on a sudden it burst upon me that ITWAS THE ACCURSED RUG, the very one which in response to acareless wish had swept me out of my own dear world, and forced me totake as wild a journey into space as ever fell to a man's lot since theuniverse was made!</p> 
<p>　　And in another second it occurred to me that if it had brought mehither it might take me hence. It was but a chance, yet worth trying whenall other chances were against me. As Ar-hap's men came shouting overthe barricade I threw myself down upon that incredible carpet and criedfrom the bottom of my heart,"I wish--I wish I were in New York!"Yes!</p> 
<p>　　A moment of thrilling suspense and then the corners lifted as though astrong breeze were playing upon them. An- other moment and they hadcurled over like an incoming surge. One swift glance I got at the smoke&nbsp; and flames, the glittering spears and angry faces, and then fold upon fold,a stifling, all-enveloping embrace, a lift, a sense of super- human speed-and then forgetfulness.</p> 
<p>　　When I came to, as reporters say, I was aware the rug had ejected meon solid ground and disappeared, forever. Where was I! It was cool,damp, and muddy. There were some iron railings close at hand and astreet lamp overhead. These things showed clearly to me, sitting on adoorstep under that light, head in hand, amazed and giddy--so amazed thatwhen slowly the recognition came of the in- credible fact my wish wasgratified and I was home again, the stupendous incident scarcely appealedto my tingling sen-ses more than one of the many others I had latelyundergone.</p> 
<p>　　Very slowly I rose to my feet, and as like a discreditable reveller ascould be, climbed the steps. The front door was open, and entering theoh, so familiar hall a sound of voices in my sitting-room on the rightcaught my ear.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh no, Mrs. Brown," said one, which I recognised at once as myPolly's, "he is dead for certain, and my heart is breaking. He would never,never have left me so long without writing if he had been alive," and thencame a great sound of sobbing.</p> 
<p>　　"Bless your kind heart, miss," said the voice of my land- lady in reply,"but you don't know as much about young gentlemen as I do. It is notlikely, if he has gone off on the razzle-dazzle, as I am sure he has, he isgoing to write every post and tell you about it. Now you go off to yourma at the hotel like a dear, and forget all about him till he comes back-that's MY advice.""I cannot, I cannot, Mrs. Brown. I cannot rest by day or sleep bynight for thinking of him; for wondering why he went away so suddenly,and for hungering for news of him. Oh, I am miserable. Gully! Gully!</p> 
<p>　　Come to me," and then there were sounds of troubled footsteps pacing toand fro and of a woman's grief.</p> 
<p>　　That was more than I could stand. I flung the door open, and, dirty,dishevelled, with unsteady steps, advanced into the room.</p> 
<p>　　"Ahem!" coughed Mrs. Brown, "just as I expected!"But I had no eyes for her. "Polly! Polly!" I cried, and that dear girl,after a startled scream and a glance to make sure it was indeed therecovered prodigal, rushed over and threw all her weight of dear, warm,comfortable woman- hood into my arms, and the moment after burst into apas- sion of happy tears down my collar.</p> 
<p>　　"Humph!" quoth the landlady, "that is not what BROWN gets when heforgets his self. No, not by any means."But she was a good old soul at heart, and, seeing how matters stood,with a parting glance of scorn in my direction and a toss of her head, wentout of the room, and closed the door behind her.</p> 
<p>　　Need I tell in detail what followed? Polly behaved like an angel, andwhen in answer to her gentle reproaches I told her the outlines of mymarvellous story she almost be- lieved me! Over there on the writing-desk lay a whole row of the unopened letters she had showered upon meduring my absence, and amongst them an official one. We went andopened it together, and it was an intimation of my promotion, a muchbetter "step" than I had ever dared to hope for.</p> 
<p>　　Holding that missive in my hand a thought suddenly oc- curred to me.</p> 
<p>　　"Polly dear, this letter makes me able to maintain you as you ought tobe maintained, and there is still a fortnight of vacation for me. Polly, willyou marry me tomorrow?""No, certainly not, sir.""Then will you marry me on Monday?""Do you truly, truly want me to?""Truly, truly.""Then, yes," and the dear girl again came blushing into my arms.</p> 
<p>　　While we were thus the door opened, and in came her parents whowere staying at a neighbouring hotel while in- quiries were made as to mymysterious absence. Not un- naturally my appearance went a long wayto confirm suspi- cions such as Mrs. Brown had confessed to, and, afterthey had given me cold salutations, Polly's mother, fixing gold glasses onthe bridge of her nose and eyeing me haughtily therefrom, observed,"And now that you ARE safely at home again, Lieuten- ant GulliverJones, I think I will take my daughter away with me. Tomorrow her&nbsp; father will ascertain the true state of her feelings after this unpleasantexperience, and sub- sequently he will no doubt communicate with you onthe subject." This very icily.</p> 
<p>　　But I was too happy to be lightly put down.</p> 
<p>　　"My dear madam," I replied, "I am happy to be able to save her fatherthat trouble. I have already communicated with this young lady as to thestate of her feelings, and as an outcome I am delighted to be able to tellyou we are to be married on Monday.""Oh yes, Mother, it is true, and if you do not want to make me themost miserable of girls again you will not be unkind to us."In brief, that sweet champion spoke so prettily and smoothed things socleverly that I was "forgiven," and later on in the evening allowed toescort Polly back to her hotel.</p> 
<p>　　"And oh!" she said, in her charmingly enthusiastic way when we weresaying goodnight, "you shall write a book about that extraordinary storyyou told me just now. Only you must promise me one thing.""What is it?""To leave out all about Heru--I don't like that part at all." This with theprettiest little pout.</p> 
<p>　　"But, Polly dear, see how important she was to the nar- rative.</p> 
<p>　　cannot quite do that.""Then you will say as little as you can about her?""No more than the story compels me to.""And you are quite sure you like me much the best, and will not goafter her again?""Quite sure."The compact was sealed in the most approved fashion; and here,indulgent reader, is the artless narrative that re- sulted--an incident soincredible in this prosaic latter-day world that I dare not ask you to believe,and must humbly content myself with hoping that if I fail to convince yet Imay at least claim the consolation of having amused you.</p>
