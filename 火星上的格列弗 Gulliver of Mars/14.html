<p>　　We soon reached the cabin where the man lived by himself whilstworking in the forest. It was a picturesque little place on a tree-overhunglagoon, thatched, wattled, and all about were piles of a pleasant-scentedbark, collected for the purpose of tanning hides, and I could not but marvelthat such a familiar process should be practised identically on two sides ofthe universal ether. But as a matter of fact the similarity of many detailsof existence here and there was the most striking of the things I learnedwhilst in the red planet.</p> 
<p>　　Within the hut stood a hearth in the centre of the floor, whereon acomfortable blaze soon sparkled, and upon the walls hung variousimplements, hides, and a store of dried fruits of various novel kinds. Myhost, when he had somewhat disdainfully watched me wash in a rill ofwater close by, suggested supper, and I agreed with heartiest good will.</p> 
<p>　　"Nothing wonderful! Oh, Mr. Blue-coat!" he said, pranc- ing aboutas he made his hospitable arrangements. "No fine meat or scented wineto unlock, one by one, all the doors of paradise, such as I have heard theyhave in lands be- yond the sea; but fare good enough for plain men whoeat but to live. So! reach me down yonder bunch of yellow aru fruit, anddon't upset that calabash, for all my funniest stories lurk at the bottom ofit."I did as he bid, and soon we were squatting by the fire toasting arus onpointed sticks, the doorway closed with a wattle hurdle, and the black andgold firelight filling the hut with fantastic shadows. Then when thebanana-like fruit was ready, the man fetched from a recess a loaf of breadsavoured with the dust of dried and pounded fish, put the foresaid calabashof strong ale to warm, and down we sat to supper with real woodmanappetites. Seldom have I enjoyed a meal so much, and when we hadfinished the fruit and the wheat cake my guide snatched up the great gourdof ale, and putting it to his lips called out:</p> 
<p>　　"Here's to you, stranger; here's to your country; here's to your girl, ifyou have one, and death to your enemies!" Then he drank deep and long,and, passed the stuff to me.</p> 
<p>　　"Here's to you, bully host, and the missus, and the children, if there areany, and more power to your el- bow!"--the which gratified him greatly,though probably he had small idea of my meaning.</p> 
<p>　　And right merry we were that evening. The host was a jolly goodfellow, and his ale, with a pleasant savour of mint in it, was the heartiestdrink I ever set lips to. We talked and laughed till the very jackalsyapped in sympathy outside. And when he had told a score of wonderfulwood stories as pungent of the life of these fairy forests as the aromaticscent of his bark-heaps outside, as iridescent with the colours of anotherworld as the rainbow bubbles rid-ing down his starlit rill, I took a turn,and told him of the commonplaces of my world so far away, whereat helaughed gloriously again. The greater the commonplace the larger hisjoy. The humblest story, hardly calculated to impress a griffin betweenwatches on the main-deck, was a masterpiece of wit to that gentle savage;and when I "took off" the tricks and foibles of some of my superiors-Heaven forgive me for such treason!--he listened with the exquisite open-mouthed delight of one who wanders in a brand-new world of mirth.</p> 
<p>　　We drank and laughed over that strong beer till the little owls outsideraised their voice in combined accord, and then the woodman, shaking thelast remnant of his sleepy wits together, and giving a reproachful look atme for finally passing him the gourd empty to the last drop, rose, threw afur on a pile of dead grass at one side of the hut, and bid me sleep, "for hisbrain was giddy with the wonders of the incredible and ludicrous spherewhich I had lately in- habited."Slowly the fire died away; slowly the quivering gold and blackarabesques on the walls merged in a red haze as the sticks dropped intotinder, and the great black outline of the hairy monster who had thrownhimself down by the embers rose up the walls against that flush like theoutline of a range of hills against a sunset glow. I listened drowsily for aspace to his snoring and the laughing answer of the brook outside, andthen that ambrosial sleep which is the gentle attendant of hardship and&nbsp; danger touched my tired eyelids, and I, too, slept.</p> 
<p>　　My friend was glum the next morning, as they who stay over-long atthe supper flagon are apt to be. He had been at work an hour on his bark-heaps when I came out into the open, and it was only by a good deal ofdiplomacy and some material help in sorting his faggots that he was gotinto a better frame of mind. I could not, however, trust his moodcompletely, and as I did not want to end so jovial a friendship with aquarrel, I hurried through our breakfast of dry bread, with hard-boiledlizard eggs, and then settling my reckoning with one of the brass buttonsfrom my coat, which he immediately threaded, with every evidence of extreme gratification, on a string of trinkets hanging round his neck, askedhim the way to Ar-hap's capital.</p> 
<p>　　"Your way is easy, friend, as long as you keep to the straight path andhave yonder two-humped mountain in front. To the left is the sea, andbehind the hill runs the canal and road by which all traffic comes or goesto Ar-hap. But above all things pass not to the hills right, for no man goesthere; there away the forests are thick as night, and in their perpetualshadows are the ruins of a Hither city, a haunted fairy town to which sometravellers have been, but whence none ever returned alive.""By the great Jove, that sounds promising! I would like to see thattown if my errand were not so urgent."But the old fellow shook his shaggy head and turned a shade yellower.</p> 
<p>　　"It is no place for decent folk," he growled. "I myself once passed within amile of its outskirts at dusk, and saw the unholy little people's lanternedprocessions starting for the shrine of Queen Yang, who, tradition says,killed herself and a thousand babies with her when we took this land.""My word, that was a holocaust! Couldn't I drop in there to lunch? Itwould make a fine paper for an anti- quarian society."Again the woodman frowned. "Do as I bid you, son. You are tooyoung and green to go on ventures by yourself. Keep to the straight road:</p> 
<p>　　shun the swamps and the fairy forest, else will you never see Ar-hap.""And as I have very urgent and very important business with him,comrade, no doubt your advice is good. I will call on Princess Yangsome other day. And now goodbye! Rougher but friendlier shelter than&nbsp; you have given me no man could ask for. I am downright sorry to partwith you in this lonely land. If ever we meet again--" but we never did!</p> 
<p>　　The honest old churl clasped me into his hairy bosom three times, stuffedmy wallet with dry fruit and bread, and once more repeating his directions,sent me on my lonely way.</p> 
<p>　　I confess I sighed while turning into the forest, and looked back morethan once at his retreating form. The loneliness of my position, thehopelessness of my venture, welled up in my heart after that goodcomradeship, and when the hut was out of sight I went forward down thegreen grass road, chin on chest, for twenty minutes in the deepestdejection. But, thank Heaven, I was born with a tough spirit, and possess amind which has learned in many fights to give brave counsel to my spirit,and thus presently I shook myself together, setting my face boldly to thequest and the day's work.</p> 
<p>　　It was not so clear a morning as the previous one, and a steamy windon what at sea I should have called the starboard bow, as I pressed forwardto the distant hill, had a curiously subduing effect on my thoughts, andfilled the forest glades with a tremulous unreality like to nothing on ourearth, and distinctly embarrassing to a stranger in a strange land. Smallbirds in that quaint atmospheric haze looked like condors, butterflies likegiant fowl, and the sim-plest objects of the forest like the imaginations ofa disordered dream. Behind that gauzy hallucination a fine white mistcame up, and the sun spread out flat and red in the sky, while the pent-inheat became almost unendurable.</p> 
<p>　　Still I plodded on, growling to myself that in Christian latitudes all theevidences would have been held to be- token a storm before night,whatever they might do here, but for the most part lost in my own gloomyspeculations. That was the more pity since, in thinking the walk over now,it seems to me that I passed many marvels, saw many glorious vistas inthose nameless forests, many spreads of colour, many incidents that, couldI but remember them more distinctly, would supply material for makingmy fortune as a descriptive traveller. But what would you? I haveforgotten, and am too virtuous to draw on my imagination, as it issometimes said other travellers have done when picturesque facts were&nbsp; deficient. Yes, I have forgotten all about that day, save that it was sultryhot, that I took off my coat and waistcoat to be cooler, carrying them, likethe tramp I was, across my arm, and thus dishevelled passed some time inthe afternoon an encampment of forest folk, wherefrom almost all the menwere gone, and the women shy and surly.</p> 
<p>　　In no very social humour myself, I walked round their woodlandvillage, and on the outskirts, by a brook, just as I was wishing there weresome one to eat my solitary lunch with, chanced upon a fellow busilyengaged in hammering stones into weapons upon a flint anvil.</p> 
<p>　　He was an ugly-looking individual at best, yet I was hard up forcompany, so I put my coat down, and, seating myself on a log opposite,proceeded to open my wallet, and take out the frugal stores the woodmanhad given me that morning.</p> 
<p>　　The man was seated upon the ground holding a stone anvil betweenhis feet, while with his hands he turned and chipped with great skill aspear-head he was making out of flint. It was about the only pastime hehad, and his little yellow eyes gleamed with a craftsman's pleasure, hisshaggy round shoulders were bent over the task, the chips flew in quickparticles, and the wood echoed musically as the arti- ficer watched thething under his hands take form and fashion. Presently I spoke, and theworker looked up, not too pleased at being thus interrupted. But he waseasy of propitiation, and over a handful of dried raisins communi- cative.</p> 
<p>　　How, I asked, knowing a craftsman's craft is often nearest to his heart,how was it such things as that he chipped came to be thought of by himand his? Whereon the woodman, having spit out the raisin-stones andwiped his fingers on his fur, said in substance that the first weapon wasfashioned when the earliest ape hurled the first stone in wrath.</p> 
<p>　　"But, chum," I said, taking up his half-finished spear and touching therazor-fine edge with admiring caution, "from hurling the crude pebble tofashioning such as this is a long stride. Who first edged and pointed theprimitive malice? What man with the soul of a thousand unborn fighters inhim notched and sharpened your natural rock?"Whereon the chipper grinned, and answered that, when the woodmenhad found stones that would crack skulls, it came upon them presently that&nbsp; they would crack nuts as well. And cracking nuts between two stonesone day a flint shattered, and there on the grass was the golden secret ofthe edge--the thing that has made man what he is.</p> 
<p>　　"Yet again, good fellow," I queried, "even this happy chance onlygives us a weapon, sharp, no doubt, and cal- culated to do a hundredservices for any ten the original pebble could have done, but stillunhandled, small in force, imperfect--now tell me, which of your amiableancestors first put a handle to the fashioned flint, and how he thought ofit?"The workman had done his flake by now, and wrapping it in a bit ofskin, put it carefully in his belt before turning to answer my question.</p> 
<p>　　"Who made the first handle for the first flint, you of the manyquestions? She did--she, the Mother," he suddenly cried, patting the earthwith his brown hand, and working himself up as he spoke, "made it in herheart for us her first-born. See, here is such as the first handled weaponthat ever came out of darkness," and he snatched from the ground, where ithad lain hidden under his fox-skin cloak, a heavy club. I saw in aninstant how it was. The club had been a sapling, and the sapling's rootshad grown about and circled with a splendid grip a lump of native flint. Awoodman had pulled the sapling, found the flint, and fashioned the two ina moment of happy inspiration, the one to an axe-head and the other to ahandle, as they lay Nature-welded!</p> 
<p>　　"This, I say, is the first--the first!" screamed the old fellow as though Iwere contradicting him, thumping the ground with his weapon, andworking himself up to a fury as its black magic entered his being. "Thisis the first: with this I slew Hetter and Gur, and those who plundered myhiding- places in the woods; with this I have killed a score of others,bursting their heads, and cracking their bones like dry sticks. With this-with this--" but here his rage rendered him in- articulate; he stammeredand stuttered for a minute, and then as the killing fury settled on him hisyellow teeth shut with a sudden snap, while through them his breathrattled like wind through dead pine branches in December, the sinews satup on his hands as his fingers tightened upon the axe-heft like the roots ofthe same pines from the ground when winter rain has washed the soil from&nbsp; beneath them; his small eyes gleamed like baleful planets; every hair uponhis shaggy back grew stiff and erect--another minute and my span wereended.</p> 
<p>　　With a leap from where I sat I flew at that hairy beast, and sinking myfists deep in his throttle, shook him till his eyes blazed with delirious fires.</p> 
<p>　　We waltzed across the short green-sward, and in and about the tree-trunks,shaking, pulling, and hitting as we went, till at last I felt the man's vigourdy- ing within him; a little more shaking, a sudden twist, and he was lyingon the ground before me, senseless and civil! That is the worst of someorators, I thought to myself, as I gloomily gathered up the scatteredfragments of my lunch; they never know when they have said enough, andare too apt to be carried away by their own arguments.</p> 
<p>　　That inhospitable village was left behind in full belief the mountainlooming in the south could be reached before nightfall, while the road toits left would serve as a sure guide to food and shelter for the evening.</p> 
<p>　　But, as it turned out, the morning's haze developed a strong mist ere theafternoon was half gone, through which it was impossible to see more thantwenty yards. My hill loomed gigantic for a time with a tantalisingappearance of being only a mile or two ahead, then wavered, becamevisionary, and finally disap- peared as completely as though the forest misthad drunk it up bodily.</p> 
<p>　　There was still the road to guide me, a fairly well- beaten track twiningthrough the glades; but even the best of highways are difficult in fog, andthis one was compli- cated by various side paths, made probably byhunters or bark-cutters, and without compass or guide marks it wasnecessary to advance with extreme caution, or get helplessly mazed.</p> 
<p>　　An hour's steady tramping brought me nowhere in particu- lar, andstopping for a minute to consider, I picked a few wild fruit, such as mywood-cutter friend had eaten, from an overhanging bush, and in so doingslipped, the soil having now become damp, and in falling broke a branchoff. The incident was only important from what follows. Pickingmyself up, perhaps a little shaken by the jolt, I set off again upon whatseemed the plain road, and being by this time displeased by mysurroundings, determined to make a push for "civilization" before the&nbsp; rapidly gathering darkness set- tled down.</p> 
<p>　　Hands in pockets and collar up, I marched forward at a good roundpace for an hour, constantly straining eyes for a sight of the hill and earsfor some indications of living beings in the deathly hush of the shroudedwoods, and at the end of that time, feeling sure habitations must now benear, arrived at what looked like a little open space, some- how seemingrather familiar in its vague outlines.</p> 
<p>　　Where had I seen such a place before? Sauntering round the margin, abush with a broken branch sud- denly attracted my attention--a brokenbush with a long slide in the mud below it, and the stamp of Navy boots inthe soft turf! I glared at those signs for a moment, then with anexclamation of chagrin recognised them only too well--it was the bushwhence I had picked the fruit, and the mark of my fall. An hour's hardwalking round some accursed woodland track had brought me exactlyback to the point I had started from--I was lost!</p> 
<p>　　It really seemed to get twenty per cent darker as I made thatabominable discovery, and the position dawned in all its uncomfortableintensity. There was nothing for it but to start off again, this time judgingmy direction only by a light breath of air drifting the mist tangles before it;and therein I made a great mistake, for the breeze had shifted severalpoints from the quarter whence it blew in the morning.</p> 
<p>　　Knowing nothing of this, I went forward with as muchlightheartedness as could be managed, humming a song to myself, andcarefully putting aside thoughts of warmth and supper, while the duskincreased and the great forest vegetation seemed to grow ranker and closerat every stepAnother disconcerting thing was that the ground sloped graduallydownwards, not upwards as it should have done, till it seemed the path layacross the flats of a forest-covered plain, which did not conform to mywish of striking a road on the foot-hills of the mountain. However, Iplodded on, drawing some small comfort from the fact that as darknesscame the mist rose from the ground and appeared to con- dense in aghostly curtain twenty feet overhead, where it hung between me and aclear night sky, presently illum- ined by starlight with the strangest effect.</p> 
<p>　　Tired, footsore, and dejected, I struggled on a little further. Oh for acab, I laughed bitterly to myself. Oh for even the humble necessaryomnibus of civilisation. Oh for the humblest tuck-shop where a mug ofhot coffee and a snack could be had by a homeless wanderer; and as Ithought and plodded savagely on, collar up, hands in pockets, through theblack tangles of that endless wood, suddenly the sound of wailing childrencaught my ear!</p> 
<p>　　It was the softest, saddest music ever mortal listened to. It was asthough scores of babes in pain were dropping to sleep on their mothers'</p> 
<p>　　breasts, and all hushing their sor- rows with one accord in a commonmelancholy chorus. I stood spell-bound at that elfin wailing, the firstsound to break the deathly stillness of the road for an hour or more, andmy blood tingled as I listened to it. Nevertheless, here was what I waslooking for; where there were weeping children there must be habitations,and shelter, and--splendid thought!--supper. Poor little babes! theircrying was the deadliest, sweetest thing in sorrows I ever listened to. If itwas cholic--why, I knew a little of medicine, and in gratitude for thatprospective supper, I had a soul big enough to cure a thousand; and if theywere in disgrace, and by some quaint Martian fashion had suffered simultaneous punishment for baby offences, I would plead for them.</p> 
<p>　　In fact, I fairly set off at the run towards the sobbing, in the black, wet,night air ahead, and, tripping as I ran, looked down and saw in the filteringstarlight that the forest grass had given place to an ancient roadway, pavedwith moss-grown flag-stones, such as they still used in Seth.</p> 
<p>　　Without stopping to think what that might mean I hur- ried on, thewailing now right ahead, a tremulous tumult of gentle grief rising andfalling on the night air like the sound of a sea after a storm; and so,presently, in a minute or two, came upon a ruined archway spanning thelonely road, held together by great masses of black-fingered creep- ers,gaunt and ghostly in the shadows, an extraordinary and unexpected vision;and as I stopped with a jerk under that forbidding gateway and glared at itstumbled masonry and great portals hanging rotten at their hinges, suddenlythe truth flashed upon me. I had taken the forbidden road after all.</p> 
<p>　　was in the ancient, ghost-haunted city of Queen Yang!</p>
