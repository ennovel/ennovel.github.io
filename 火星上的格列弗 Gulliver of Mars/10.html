The Martianweather for the moment was lovely and the many-coloured grass lush andsoft under foot. Mile after mile I went, heeding the distance lightly, theair was so elastic. Now pressing forward as the main interest of myerrand took the upper hand, and remembrance of poor Heru like a crushedwhite flower in the red grip of those cruel ravishers came upon me, andthen pausing to sigh with pleasure or stand agape--forgetful even of her--inwonder of the unknown loveliness about me.</p> 
<p>　　And well might I stare! Everything in that forest was wonderful!</p> 
<p>　　There were plants which turned from colour to colour with the varyinghours of the day. While others had a growth so swift it was dangerous tosit in their neighbour- hood since the long, succulent tendrils clamberingfrom the parent stem would weave you into a helpless tangle while yougazed, fascinated, upon them. There were plants that climbed andwalked; sighing plants who called the winged things of the air to themwith a noise so like to a girl sobbing that again and again I stopped in thetangled path to listen. There were green bladder-mosses which swamabout the surface of the still pools like gigantic frog-broods. There wereon the ridges warrior trees burning in the vindictiveness of a longforgotten cause--a blaze of crimson scimitar thorns from root to topmosttwig; and down again in the cool hollows were lady-bushes makingtwilight of the green gloom with their cloudy ivory blos- soms and fillingthe shadows with such a heavy scent that head and heart reeled with fatalpleasure as one pushed aside their branches. Every river-bed was full ofmighty reeds, whose stems clattered together when the wind blew likeswords on shields, and every now and then a bit of forest was woventogether with the ropey stems of giant creepers till no man or beast couldhave passed save for the paths which constant use had kept open throughthe mazes.</p> 
<p>　　All day long I wandered on through those wonderful woodlands, andin fact loitered so much over their infinite marvels that when sundown&nbsp; came all too soon there was still undulating forest everywhere, vistas offairy glades on every hand, peopled with incredible things and echoingwith sounds that excited the ears as much as other things fascinated theeyes, but no sign of the sea or my fishing village anywhere.</p> 
<p>　　It did not matter; a little of the Martian leisureliness was getting intomy blood: "If not today, why then tomorrow," as An would have said; andwith this for comfort I selected a warm, sandy hollow under the roots of abig tree, made my brief arrangements for the night, ate some honey cakes,and was soon sleeping blissfully.</p> 
<p>　　I woke early next morning, after many hours of interrupted dreams,and having nothing to do till the white haze had lifted and made it possibleto start again, rested idly a time on my elbow and watched the sunshinefilter into the recesses.</p> 
<p>　　Very pretty it was to see the thick canopy overhead, by star-light soimpenetrable, open its chinks and fissures as the searching sun came uponit; to see the pin-hole gaps shine like spangles presently, the spacesbroaden into lesser suns, and even the thick leafage brighten and shinedown on me with a soft sea-green radiance. The sunward sides of thetree-stems took a glow, and the dew that ran dripping down their mossysides trickled blood-red to earth. Else- where the shadows were stillblack, and strange things began to move in them--things we in our middle-aged world have never seen the likeness of: beasts half birds, birds halfcreeping things, and creeping things which it seemed to me passed throughlesser creations down to the basest life that crawls without interruption ordivision.</p> 
<p>　　It was not for me, a sailor, to know much of such things, yet some Icould not fail to notice. On one grey branch overhead, jutting from atree-stem where a patch of velvet moss made in the morning glint a fairybed, a won- derful flower unfolded. It was a splendid bud, ivory white,cushioned in leaves, and secured to its place by naked white roots thatclipped the branch like fingers of a lady's hand. Even as I looked it opened,a pale white star, and hung pensive and inviting on its mossy cushion.</p> 
<p>　　From it came such a ravishing odour that even I, at the further end of thegreat scale of life, felt my pulses quicken and my eyes brighten with&nbsp; cupidity. I was in the very act of climbing the tree, but before I couldmove hand or foot two things happened, whether you take my word forthem or no.</p> 
<p>　　Firstly, up through a glade in the underwood, attracted by the odour,came an ugly brown bird with a capacious beak and shining claws. Heperched near by, and peeped and peered until he made out the flowerpining on her virgin stem, whereat off he hopped to her branch and there,with a cynical chuckle, strutted to and fro between her and the main stemlike an ill genius guarding a fairy princess.</p> 
<p>　　Surely Heaven would not allow him to tamper with so chaste a bud!</p> 
<p>　　My hand reached for a stone to throw at him when happened the secondthing. There came a gentle pat upon the woodland floor, and from a treeoverhead dropped down another living plant like to the one above yet notexactly similar, a male, my instincts told me, in full sol- itary blossom likeher above, cinctured with leaves, and supported by half a score of thickwhite roots that worked, as I looked, like the limbs of a crab. In atwinkling that parti-coloured gentleman vegetable near me was off to thestem upon which grew his lady love; running and scram- bling, draggingthe finery of his tasselled petals behind, it was laughable to watch hiseagerness. He got a grip of the tree and up he went, "hand over hand,"root over root. I had just time to note others of his species had droppedhere and there upon the ground, and were hurry- ing with frantic haste tothe same destination when he reached the fatal branch, and was straddlingvictoriously down it, blind to all but love and longing. That ill-omenedbird who stood above the maiden-flower let him come within a stalk'slength, so near that the white splendour of his sleeping lady gleamedwithin arms' reach, then the great beak was opened, the great claws made aclutch, the gal- lant's head was yanked from his neck, and as it wenttumbling down the maw of the feathered thing his white legs fell spinningthrough space, and lay knotting them- selves in agony upon the ground fora minute or two before they relaxed and became flaccid in the repose ofdeath. An- other and another vegetable suitor made for that fatal tryst,and as each came up the snap of the brown bird's beak was all theirobsequies. At last no more came, and then that Nemesis of claws and&nbsp; quills walked over to the girl-flower, his stomach feathers ruffled withrepletion, the green blood of her lovers dripping from his claws, andpulled her golden heart out, tore her white limbs one from the other, andswallowed her piecemeal before my very eyes! Then up in wrath Ijumped and yelled at him till the woods echoed, but too late to stay hissacrilege.</p> 
<p>　　By this time the sun was bathing everything in splendour, and turningaway from the wonders about me, I set off at best pace along the well-trodden path which led without turning to the west coast village where thecanoes were.</p> 
<p>　　It proved far closer than expected. As a matter of fact the forest inthis direction grew right down to the water's edge; the salt-loving treesactually overhanging the waves--one of the pleasantest sights in nature-and thus I came right out on top of the hamlet before there had been anindication of its presence. It occupied two sides of a pretty little bay, thethird side being flat land given over to the cultivation of an enormousspecies of gourd whose characteristic yellow flowers and green, succulentleaves were discernible even at this distance.</p> 
<p>　　I branched off along the edge of the surf and down a dainty littleflowery path, noticing meanwhile how the whole bay was filled byhundreds of empty canoes, while scores of others were drawn up on thestrand, and then the first thing I chanced upon was a group of people-youthful, of course, with the eternal Martian bloom--and in the splendidsimplicity of almost complete nakedness. My first idea was that theywere bathing, and fixing my eyes on the tree-tops with great propriety, Igave a warning cough. At that sound instead of getting to cover, orclothes, all started up and stood staring for a time like a herd of startledcattle. It was highly embarrassing; they were right in the path, a rounddozen of them, naked and so little ashamed that when I edged awaymodestly they began to run after me. And the farther they came forwardthe more I retired, till we were playing a kind of game of hide-and-seekround the tree-stems. In the middle of it my heel caught in a root anddown I went very hard and very ignominiously, whereon those laughing,light-hearted folk rushed in, and with smiles and jests helped me to my&nbsp; feet.</p> 
<p>　　"Was I the traveller who had come from Seth?""Yes.""Oh, then that was well. They had heard such a traveller was on theroad, and had come a little way down the path, as far as might be withoutfatigue, to meet him.""Would I eat with them?" these amiable strangers asked, pushing theirsoft warm fingers into mine and ringing me round with a circle. "Butfirstly might they help me out of my clothes? It was hot, and these thingswere cumber- some." As to the eating, I was agreeable enough seeinghow casual meals had been with me lately, but my clothes, though Heavenknows they were getting horribly ragged and travel-stained, I clung todesperately.</p> 
<p>　　My new friends shrugged their dimpled shoulders and, argumentsbeing tedious, at once squatted round me in the dappled shade of a big treeand produced their stores of never failing provisions. After a pleasantlittle meal taken thus in the open and with all the simplicity Martians delight in, we got to talking about those yellow canoes which were bobbingabout on the blue waters of the bay.</p> 
<p>　　"Would you like to see where they are grown?" asked an individualbasking by my side.</p> 
<p>　　"Grown!" I answered with incredulity. "Built, you mean. Never inmy life did I hear of growing boats.""But then, sir," observed the girl as she sucked the honey out of thestalk of an azure convolvulus flower and threw the remains at a butterflythat sailed across the sunshine, "you know so little! You have come fromafar, from some barbarous and barren district. Here we undoubtedlygrow our boats, and though we know the Thither folk and suchuncultivated races make their craft by cumbrous methods of flat planks,yet we prefer our own way, for one thing be- cause it saves trouble," andas she murmured that all- sufficient reason the gentle damsel noddedreflectively.</p> 
<p>　　But one of her companions, more lively for the moment, tickled herwith a straw until she roused, and then said, "Let us take the stranger to the&nbsp; boat garden now. The cur- rent will drift us round the bay, and we cancome back when it turns. If we wait we shall have to row in bothdirections, or even walk," and again planetary slothfulness carried the day.</p> 
<p>　　So down to the beach we strolled and launched one of the golden-huedskiffs upon the pretty dancing wavelets just where they ran, lipped withjewelled spray, on the shore, and then only had I a chance to scrutinisetheir material. I patted that one we were upon inside and out. I notedwith a seaman's admiration its lightness, elasticity, and supreme sleekness,its marvellous buoyancy and fairy- like "lines," and after some minutes'</p> 
<p>　　consideration it sud- denly flashed across me that it was all of gourd rind.</p> 
<p>　　And as if to supply confirmation, the flat land we were ap- proaching onthe opposite side of the bay was covered by the characteristic verdure ofthese plants with a touch here and there of splendid yellow blossoms, butall of gigantic proportions.</p> 
<p>　　"Ay," said a Martian damsel lying on the bottom, and taking andkissing my hand as she spoke, in the simple- hearted way of her people, "Isee you have guessed how we make our boats. Is it the same in yourdistant country?""No, my girl, and what's more, I am a bit uneasy as to what the fellowson the Carolina will say if they ever hear I went to sea in a hollowed-outpumpkin, and with a young lady--well, dressed as you are--for crew.</p> 
<p>　　Even now I can- not imagine how you get your ships so trim and shapely-there is not a seam or a patch anywhere, it looks as if you had run theminto a mould.""That's just what we have done, sir, and now you will witness themoulds at work, for here we are," and the little skiff was pulled ashore andthe Martians and I jumped out on the shelving beach, hauled our boat uphigh and dry, and there right over us, like great green umbrellas, spread thefronds of the outmost garden of this strangest of all ship- building yards.</p> 
<p>　　Briefly, and not to make this part of my story too long, those gilded boysand girls took me ashore, and chattering like finches in the evening,showed how they planted their gourd seed, nourished the gigantic plants asthey grew with brackish water and the burnt ashes; then, when theyflowered, mated the male and female blossoms, glorious funnels of golden&nbsp; hue big enough for one to live in; and when the young fruit was of thebigness of an ordinary bolster, how they slipped it into a double mould ofopen reed-work something like the two halves of a walnut- shell; and how,growing day by day in this, it soon took every curve and line they chose togive it, even the hanging keel below, the strengthened bulwarks, and tallprow-piece. It was so ingenious, yet simple; and I confess I laughed overmy first skiff "on the stalk," and fell to bantering the Martians, askingwhether it was a good season for navies, whether their Cunarders werespreading nicely, if they could give me a pinch of barge seed, or a yacht inbud to show to my friends at home.</p> 
<p>　　But those lazy people took the matter seriously enough. They led medown green alleys arched over with huge melon-like leaves; they led mealong innumerable byways, making me peep and peer through thechequered sunlight at ocean-growing craft, that had budded twelve monthsbefore, already filling their moulds to the last inch of space. They told methat when the growing process was sufficiently advanced, they loosenedthe casing, and cutting a hole into the interior of each giant fruit, scoopedout all its seed, thereby checking more advance, and throwing into the rindstrength that would otherwise have gone to reproductive- ness. They saideach fruit made two vessels, but the upper half was always best and usedfor long salt-water jour- neys, the lower piece being but for punting orfishing on their lakes. They cut them in half while still green, scrapedout the light remaining pulp when dry, and dragged them down with theminimum of trouble, light as feathers, ten- acious as steel plate, andalready in the form and fashion of dainty craft from five to twenty feet inlength, when the process was completed.</p> 
<p>　　By the time we had explored this strangest of ship- building yards, andI had seen last year's crop on the stocks being polished and fitted withseats and gear, the sun was going down; and the Martian twilight, owing tothe comparative steepness of the little planet's sides, being brief, westrolled back to the village, and there they gave me harbourage for thenight, ambrosial supper, and a deep draught of the wine of Forgetfulness,under the gauzy spell of which the real and unreal melted into the vistas ofrosy oblivion, and I slept.</p>
