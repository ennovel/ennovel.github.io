<p>　　All the water gave out on the morning after I had bearded Ar-hap in hisden, and our strength went with it. No earthly heat was ever like it, and itdrank our vitality up from every pore. Water there was down below inthe bitter, streaming gulf, but so noisome that we dared not even bathethere; here there was none but the faintest trickle. All discipline was at anend; all desire save such as was born of thirst. Heru I saw as often as Iwished as she lay gasping, with poor Si at her feet, in the women'sverandah; but the heat was so tremendous that I gazed at her with lack-lustre eyes, staggering to and fro amongst the court- yard shadows,without nerve to plot her rescue or strength to carry out anything my mindmight have conceived.</p> 
<p>　　We prayed for rain and respite. Ar-hap had prayed with a wealth ofpicturesque ceremonial. We had all prayed and cursed by turns, but stillthe heavens would not relent, and the rain came not.</p> 
<p>　　At last the stifling heat and vapour reached an almost intolerable pitch.</p> 
<p>　　The earth reeked with unwholesome hum- ours no common summer coulddraw from it, the air was sulphurous and heavy, while overhead the skyseemed a tawny dome, from edge to edge of angry clouds, parting nowand then to let us see the red disc threatening us.</p> 
<p>　　Hour after hour slipped by until, when evening was upon us, theclouds drew together, and thunder, with a continu- ous low rumble, beganto rock from sky to sky. Fitful showers of rain, odorous and heavy, butunsatisfying, fell, and birds and beasts of the woodlands came slinking into our streets and courtyards. Ever since the sky first darkened our ownanimals had become strangely familiar, and now here were these wildthings of the woods slinking in for companion- ship, sagheaded andfrightened. To me especially they came, until that last evening as Istaggered dying about the streets or sat staring into the remorseless skyfrom the steps of Heru's prison house, all sorts of beasts drew softly in andcrowded about, whether I sat or moved, all asking for the hope I had not to&nbsp; give them.</p> 
<p>　　At another time this might have been embarrassing; then it seemedpure commonplace. It was a sight to see them slink in between theuseless showers, which fell like hot tears upon us--sleek panthers withlolling tongues; russet-red wood dogs; bears and sloths from the darkarcades of the remote forests, all casting themselves down gasping in thepalace shadows; strange deer, who staggered to the garden plots and laythere heaving their lives out; mighty boars, who came from the rivermarshes and silently nozzled a place amongst their enemies to die in!</p> 
<p>　　Even the wolves came off the hills, and, with bloodshot eyes and tonguesthat dripped foam, flung themselves down in my shadow.</p> 
<p>　　All along the tall stockades apes sat sad and listless, and on the roof-ridges storks were dying. Over the branches of the trees, whose leaveswere as thin as though we had had a six months' drought, the toucans andMartian parrots hung limp and fashionless like gaudy rags, and in thecourtyard ground the corn-rats came up from their tunnels in the scorchingearth to die, squeaking in scores along under the walls.</p> 
<p>　　Our common sorrow made us as sociable as though I were Noah, andAr-hap's palace mound another Ararat. Hour after hour I sat amongst allthese lesser beasts in the hot darkness, waiting for the end. Every nowand then the heavy clouds parted, changing the gloom to sudden fierydaylight as the great red eye in the west looked upon us through thecrevice, and, taking advantage of those gleams, I would reel across towhere, under a spout leading from a dried rivulet, I had placed a cup tocollect the slow and tepid drops that were all now coming down the reedfor Heru. And as I went back each time with that sickly spoonful at thebottom of the vessel all the dying beasts lifted their heads and watched-the thirsty wolves shamb- ling after me; the boars half sat up and gruntedplaintively; the panthers, too weak to rise, beat the dusty ground with theirtails; and from the portico the blue storks, with trailing wings, croakedhusky greeting.</p> 
<p>　　But slower and slower came the dripping water, more and moreintolerable the heat. At last I could stand it no longer. What purposedid it serve to lay gasping like this, dying cruelly without a hope of rescue,&nbsp; when a shorter way was at my side? I had not drank for a day and a half.</p> 
<p>　　I was past active reviling; my head swam; my reason was clouded. No!</p> 
<p>　　would not stand it any longer. Once more I would take Heru and poor Sithe cup that was but a mockery after all, then fix my sword into the groundand try what next the Fates had in store for me.</p> 
<p>　　So once again the leathern mug was fetched and carried through theprostrate guards to where the Martian girl lay, like a withered flower, uponher couch. Once again I moistened those fair lips, while my own tonguewas black and swollen in my throat, then told Si, who had had none all theafternoon, to drink half and leave half for Heru. Poor Si put her achinglips to the cup and tilted it a little, then passed it to her mistress. AndHeru drank it all, and Si cried a few hot tears behind her hands, FOR SHEHAD TAKEN NONE, and she knew it was her life!</p> 
<p>　　Again picking a way through the courtyard, scarce notic- ing how thebeasts lifted their heads as I passed, I went instinctively, cup in hand, tothe well, and then hesitated. Was I a coward to leave Heru so? Ought Inot to stay and see it out to the bitter end? Well, I would compound withFate. I would give the malicious gods one more chance. I would put thecup down again, and until seven drops had fallen into it I would wait.</p> 
<p>　　That there might be no mistake about it, no sooner was the mug in placeunder the nozzle wherefrom the moisture beads collected and fell withinfinite slowness, than my sword, on which I meant to throw my- self, wasbared and the hilt forced into a gaping crack in the ground, and sullenlycontented to leave my fate so, I sat down beside it.</p> 
<p>　　I turned grimly to the spout and saw the first drop fall, then another,and another later on, but still no help came. There was a long rift in theclouds now, and a glare like that from an open furnace door was upon me.</p> 
<p>　　I had noticed when I came to the spring how the comet which was killingus hung poised exactly upon the point of a dis- tant hill. If he had passedhis horrible meridian, if he was going from us, if he sunk but a hair'sbreadth before that seventh drop should fall, I could tell it would meansalvation.</p> 
<p>　　But the fourth drop fell, and he was big as ever. The fifth drop fell,and a hot, pleasing nose was thrust into my hand, and looking down I saw&nbsp; a grey wolf had dragged herself across the court and was asking witheloquent eyes for the help I could not give. The sixth drop gathered, andfell; already the seventh was like a seedling pearl in its place. The dyingwolf yanked affectionately at my hand, but I put her by and undid mytunic. Big and bright that drop hung to the spout lip; another minute andit would fall. A beauti- ful drop, I laughed, peering closely at it, manycoloured, prismatic, flushing red and pink, a tiny living ruby, hanging by atouch to the green rim above; enough! enough! The quiver of an eyelashwould unhinge it now; and angry with the life I already felt was behind me,and turning in defiant expectation to the new to come, I rose, saw the redgleam of my sword jutting like a fiery spear from the cracking soil where Ihad planted it, then looked once more at the drop and glanced for the lasttime at the sullen red terror on the hill.</p> 
<p>　　Were my eyes dazed, my senses reeling? I said a space ago that themeteor stood exactly on the mountain-top and if it sunk a hair's breadth Ishould note it; and now, why, there WAS a flaw in its lower margin, aflattening of the great red foot that before had been round and perfect. Iturned my smarting eyes away a minute,--saw the seventh drop fall with amelodious tingle into the cup, then back again,-- there was no mistake--thetruant fire was a fraction less, it had shrunk a fraction behind the hill evensince I looked, and thereon all my life ran back into its channels, the worlddanced before me, and "Heru!" I shouted hoarsely, reeling back towardsthe palace, "Heru, 'tis well; the worst is past!"But the little princess was unconscious, and at her feet was poor Si,quite dead, still reclining with her head in her hands just as I had left her.</p> 
<p>　　Then my own senses gave out, and dropping down by them I rememberedno more.</p> 
<p>　　I must have lain there an hour or two, for when con- sciousness cameagain it was night--black, cool, profound night, with an inky sky low downupon the tree-tops, and out of it such a glorious deluge of rain descendingswiftly and silently as filled my veins even to listen to. Eagerly Ishuffled away to the porch steps, down them into the swimming courtyard,and ankle-deep in the glorious flood, set to work lapping furiously at thefirst puddle, drinking with gasps of pleasure, gasping and drinking again,&nbsp; feeling my body filling out like the thirsty steaming earth below me.</p> 
<p>　　Then, as I still drank insatiably, there came a gleam of lightning out of thegloom overhead, a brilliant yellow blaze, and by it I saw a few yards awaya panther drinking at the same pool as myself, his gleaming eyes lowdown like mine upon the water, and by his side two apes, the black waterrunning in at their gaping mouths, while out beyond were more pools,more drinking animals. Everything was drinking. I saw their outlinedforms, the gleam shining on wet skins as though they were cut out in silveragainst the darkness, each beast steaming like a volcano as the Heaven-sent rain smoked from his fevered hide, all drinking for their lives,heedless of aught else--and then came the thunder.</p> 
<p>　　It ran across the cloudy vault as though the very sky were being rippedapart, rolling in mighty echoes here and there before it died away. As itstopped, the rain also fell less heavily for a minute, and as I lay with myface low down I heard the low, contented lapping of numberless tonguesunceasing, insatiable. Then came the lightning again, lighting upeverything as though it were daytime. The twin black apes were stilldrinking, but the panther across the puddle had had enough; I saw him lifthis grateful head up to the flare; saw the limp red tongue licking the blacknose, the green eyes shining like opals, the water dripping in threads ofdiamonds from the hairy tag under his chin and every tuft upon his chest-then darkness again.</p> 
<p>　　To and fro the green blaze rocked between the thunder crashes. Itstruck a house a hundred yards away, stripping every shingle from the roofbetter than a master builder could in a week. It fell a minute after on atall tree by the courtyard gate, and as the trunk burst into white splin- ters Isaw every leaf upon the feathery top turn light side up against the violetreflection in the sky beyond, and then the whole mass came down to earthwith a thud that crushed the courtyard palings into nothing for twentyyards and shook me even across the square.</p> 
<p>　　Another time I might have stopped to marvel or to watch, as I haveoften watched with sympathetic pleasure, the gods thus at play; but tonightthere were other things on hand. When I had drunk, I picked up an earthencrock, filled it, and went to Heru. It was a rough drinking-vessel for&nbsp; those dainty lips, and an indifferent draught, being as much mud as aughtelse, but its effect was wonderful. At the first touch of that turgid stuff ashiver of delight passed through the drowsy lady. At the second she gavea sigh, and her hand tightened on my arm. I fetched another crockful,and by the flickering light rocking to and fro in the sky, took her headupon my shoulder, like a prodigal new come into riches, squandering thestuff, giving her to drink and bathing face and neck till presently, to mydelight, the princess's eyes opened. Then she sat up, and taking the basinfrom me drank as never lady drank before, and soon was almost her-selfagain.</p> 
<p>　　I went out into the portico, there snuffing the deep, strong breath of thefragrant black earth receiving back into its gaping self what the last fewdays had taken from it, while quick succeeding thoughts of escape andflight passed across my brain. All through the fiery time we had just hadthe chance of escaping with the fair booty yonder had been present.</p> 
<p>　　Without her, flight would have been easy enough, but that was not worthconsidering for a moment. With her it was more difficult, yet, as I hadwatched the wood- men, accustomed to cool forest shades, faint under thefiery glare of the world above, to make a dash for liberty seemed eachhour more easy. I had seen the men in the streets drop one by one, andthe spears fall from the hands of guards about the pallisades; I had seenmessengers who came to and fro collapse before their errands wereaccomplished, and the forest women, who were Heru's gaolers, groan anddrop across the thresholds of her prison, until at length the way was clear-a babe might have taken what he would from that half-scorched town andasked no man's leave. Yet what did it avail me? Heru was helpless, myown spirit burnt in a nerveless frame, and so we stayed.</p> 
<p>　　But with rain strength came back to both of us. The guards, lyingabout like black logs, were only slowly re- turning to consciousness; thetown still slept, and darkness favoured; before they missed us in themorning light we might be far on the way back to Seth--a dangerous waytruly, but we were like to tread a rougher one if we stayed. In fact, directlymy strength returned with the cooler air, I made up my mind to the ventureand went to Heru, who by this time was much recovered. To her I&nbsp; whispered my plot, and that gentle lady, as was only natural, trembled atits dangers. But I put it to her that no time could be better than thepresent: the storm was going over; morning would "line the black mantleof the night with a pink dawn of promise"; before any one stirred wemight be far off, shaping a course by our luck and the stars for her kindred,at whose name she sighed. If we stayed, I argued, and the king changedhis mind, then death for me, and for Heru the arms of that surly monarch,and all the rest of her life caged in these pallisades amongst the uncouthforms about us.</p> 
<p>　　The lady gave a frightened little shiver at the picture, but after amoment, laying her head upon my shoulder, an- swered, "Oh, my guardianspirit and helper in adversity, I too have thought of tomorrow, and doubtwhether that horror, that great swine who has me, will not invent anexcuse for keeping me. Therefore, though the forest roads are dread- ful,and Seth very far away, I will come; I give myself into your hands. Dowhat you will with me.""Then the sooner the better, princess. How soon can you beprepared?"She smiled, and stooping picked up her slippers, saying as she did so,"I am ready!"There were no arrangements to be made. Every instant was of value.</p> 
<p>　　So, to be brief, I threw a dark cloak over the damsel's shoulders, for indeedshe was clad in little more than her loveliness and the gauziest filaments ofa Hither girl's underwear, and hand in hand led her down the log steps,over the splashing, ankle-deep courtyard, and into the shadows of thegateway beyond.</p> 
<p>　　Down the slope we went; along towards the harbour, through a scoreof deserted lanes where nothing was to be heard but the roar of rain andthe lapping of men and beasts, drinking in the shadows as though theynever would stop, and so we came at last unmolested to the wharf. ThereI hid royal Seth between two piles of merchandise, and went to look for aboat suitable to our needs. There were plenty of small craft moored torings along the quay, and selecting a canoe--it was no time to stand onniceties of property-- easily managed by a single paddle, I brought it round&nbsp; to the steps, put in a fresh water-pot, and went for the princess.</p> 
<p>　　With her safely stowed in the prow, a helpless, sodden little morsel offeminine loveliness, things began to appear more hopeful and an escapedown to blue water, my only idea, for the first time possible. Yet I mustneeds go and well nigh spoil everything by over-solicitude for my charge.</p> 
<p>　　Had we pushed off at once there can be no doubt my credit as a spiritwould have been established for all time in the Thither capital, and thebelief universally held that Heru had been wafted away by myenchantment to the regions of the unknown. The idea would havegradually grown into a tradition, receiving embellishments in succeedinggen-erations, until little wood children at their mother's knees came tolisten in awe to the story of how, once upon a time, the Sun-god loved abeautiful maiden, and drove his fiery chariot across the black night-fieldsto her prison door, scorch- ing to death all who strove to gainsay him.</p> 
<p>　　How she flew into his arms and drove away before all men's eyes, in hisred car, into the west, and was never seen again--the foresaid Sun-godbeing I, Gulliver Jones, a much under- paid lieutenant in the gloriousUnited States navy, with a packet of overdue tailors' bills in my pocket,and nothing lovable about me save a partiality for meddling with otherpeople's affairs.</p> 
<p>　　This is how it might have been, but I spoiled a pretty fairy story andchanged the whole course of Martian history by going back at thatmoment in search of a wrap for my prize. Right on top of the steps was aman with a lantern, and half a glance showed me it was the harbour mastermet with on my first landing.</p> 
<p>　　"Good evening," he said suspiciously. "May I ask what you aredoing on the quay at such an hour as this?""Doing? Oh, nothing in particular, just going out for a little fishing.""And your companion the lady--is she too fond of fishing?"I swore between my teeth, but could not prevent the fel- low walkingto the quay edge and casting his light full upon the figure of the girl below.</p> 
<p>　　I hate people who interfere with other people's business!</p> 
<p>　　"Unless I am very much mistaken your fishing friend is the Hitherwoman brought here a few days ago as tribute to Ar-hap.""Well," I answered, getting into a nice temper, for I had been verymuch harrassed of late, "put it at that. What would you do if it were so?""Call up my rain-drunk guards, and give you in charge as a thiefcaught meddling with the king's property.""Thanks, but as my interviews with Ar-hap have al- ready begun togrow tedious, we will settle this little matter here between ourselves atonce." And without more to-do I closed with him. There was a briefscuffle and then I got in a blow upon his jaw which sent the harbourmaster flying back head over heels amongst the sugar bales and potatoes.</p> 
<p>　　Without waiting to see how he fared I ran down the steps, jumped onboard, loosened the rope, and pushed out into the river. But my heartwas angry and sore, for I knew, as turned out to be the case, that our secretwas one no more; in a short time we should have the savage king inpursuit, and now there was nothing for it but headlong flight with only asmall chance of getting away to distant Seth.</p> 
<p>　　Luckily the harbour master lay insensible until he was found at dawn,so that we had a good start, and the moment the canoe passed from thearcade-like approach to the town the current swung her head automaticallyseaward, and away we went down stream at a pace once more filling mewith hope.</p>
