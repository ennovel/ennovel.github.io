What was I to do? Without all was black andcheerless, inside there was at least shelter. Wet and cold, my couragewas not to be put down by the stories of a silly savage; I would go onwhatever happened. Besides, the soft sound of crying, now apparentlyall about, seemed companionable, and I had heard so much of ghosts oflate, the sharp edge of fear at their presence was wearing off.</p> 
<p>　　So in I went: up a broad, decayed street, its flagstones heavedeverywhere by the roots of gnarled trees, and finding nothing save ruin,tried to rest under a wall. But the night air was chilly and the shelterpoor, so out I came again, with the wailing in the shadows so close aboutnow that I stopped, and mustering up courage called aloud:</p> 
<p>　　"Hullo, you who weep there in the dark, are you living or dead?"And after a minute from the hollows of the empty hearths around came thesad little responsive echo:</p> 
<p>　　"Are you living or dead?" It was very delusive and un- satisfactory,and I was wondering what to do next when a slant of warmer wind cameup behind me under the mist, and immediately little tongues of blue flameblossomed with- out visible cause in every darksome crevice; pale flickersof miasmic light rising pallid from every lurking nook and corner in theblack desolation as though a thousand lamps were lit by unseen fingers,and, knee high, floated out into the thoroughfare where they oscillatedgently in airy grace, and then, forming into procession, began drifting before the tepid air towards the city centre. At once I thought of what thewoodcutter had seen, but was too wet and sulky by this time to care. Thefascination of the place was on me, and dropping into rear of the march, Iwent forward with it. By this time the wailing had stopped, though nowand then it seemed a dark form moved in the empty door- ways on eitherhand, while the mist, parting into gossamers before the wind, tookmarvellously human forms in every alley and lane we passed.</p> 
<p>　　Thus I, a sodden giant, led by those elfin torches, paced through thecity until we came to an open square with a great lumber of ruins in thecentre all marred and spoiled by vegetation; and here the lights wavered,and went out by scores and hundreds, just as the petals drop from spentflowers, while it seemed, though it may have been only wind in the rankgrass, that the air was full of most plaintive sighs as each little lampslipped into oblivion.</p> 
<p>　　The big pile was a mass of fallen masonry, which, from the brokenpillars all about, might have been a palace or temple once. I pushed in,but it was as dark as Hades here, so, after struggling for a time in alabyrinth of chambers, chose a sandy recess, with some dry herbage byway of bedding in a corner, and there, thankful at least for shel- ter, mynight's wanderings came to an end and I coiled myself down, ate a lasthandful of dry fruit, and, strange as it may seem, was soon sleepingpeacefully.</p> 
<p>　　I dreamed that night that a woman, with a face as white as ivory, cameand bent over me. She led a babe by either hand, while behind her werescores of other ones, with lovely faces, but all as pale as the starsthemselves, who looked and sighed, but said nothing, and when they hadstared their fill, dropped out one by one, leaving a wonderful blank in themonotony where they had been; but beyond that dream nothing happened.</p> 
<p>　　It was a fine morning when I woke again, and ob- viously broad dayoutside, the sunshine coming down through cracks in the old palace roof,and lying in golden pools on the floor with dazzling effect.</p> 
<p>　　Rubbing my eyes and sitting up, it took me some time to get my sensestogether, and at first an uneasy feeling possessed me that I was somehowdematerialised and in an unreal world. But a twinge of cramp in my leftarm, and a healthy sneeze, which frightened a score of bats overheadnearly out of their senses, was reassuring on this point, and rubbing awaythe cramp and staggering to my feet, I looked about at the strangesurroundings. It was cavernous chaos on every side: magnificentarchitecture reduced to the confusion of a debris-heap, only the hollowchambers being here and there preserved by massive columns meetingoverhead. Into these the yellow light filtered wher- ever a rent in a&nbsp; cupola or side-wall admitted it, and allured by the vision of corridors onebeyond the other, I presently set off on a tour of discovery.</p> 
<p>　　Twenty minutes' scrambling brought me to a place where the fallenjambs of a fine doorway lay so close together that there was barely roomto pass between them. However, seeing light beyond, I squeezed through,and I found my- self in the best-preserved chamber of all--a wide, roomyhall with a domed roof, a haze of mural paintings on the walls, and amarble floor nearly hidden in a century of fallen dust. I stumbled oversomething at the threshold, and picking it up, found it was a baby's skull!</p> 
<p>　　And there were more of them now that my eyes became accustomed to thelight. The whole floor was mottled with them--scores and hundreds ofbones and those poor little relics of humanity jutting out of the sandeverywhere. In the hush of that great dead nursery the little whitetrophies seemed inexpressibly pathetic, and I should have turned backreverently from that chamber of forgotten sorrows but that somethingcaught my eye in the centre of it.</p> 
<p>　　It was an oblong pile of white stone, very ill-used and chipped, wrist-deep in dust, yet when a slant of light came in from above and fell straightupon it, the marble against the black gloom beyond blazed like living pearl.</p> 
<p>　　It was dazzling; and shading my eyes and going tenderly over through thepoor dead babes, I looked, and there, full in the shine, lay a woman'sskeleton, still wrapped in a robe of which little was left save the hard goldembroidery. Her brown hair, wonderful to say, still lay like lank, deadsea- weed about her, and amongst it was a fillet crown of plain iron setwith gems such as eye never looked upon before. There were not many,but enough to make the proud sim- plicity of that circlet glisten like a littleband of fire--a gleaming halo on her dead forehead infinitely fascinating.</p> 
<p>　　At her sides were two other little bleached human flowers, and I stoodbefore them for a long time in silent sympathy.</p> 
<p>　　Could this be Queen Yang, of whom the woodcutter had told me? Itmust be--who else? And if it were, what strange chance had brought mehere--a stranger, yet the first to come, since her sorrow, from her distantkindred? And if it were, then that fillet belonged of right to Heru, the lastrep- resentative of her kind. Ought I not to take it to her rather than leave&nbsp; it as spoil to the first idle thief with pluck enough to deride the mysteriesof the haunted city? Long time I thought over it in the faint, heavyatmosphere of that hall, and then very gently unwound the hair, lifted thecirclet, and, scarcely knowing what I did, put it in my shoulder-bag.</p> 
<p>　　After that I went more cheerfully into the outside sun- shine, andsetting my clothes to dry on a stone, took stock of the situation. Theplace was, perhaps, not quite so romantic by day as by night, and thescattered trees, matted by creepers, with which the whole were overgrown,prevented anything like an extensive view of the ruined city being obtained. But what gave me great satisfaction was to note over these treesto the eastward a two-humped mountain, not more than six or seven milesdistant--the very one I had mislaid the day before. Here was reality and achance of getting back to civilisation. I was as glad as if home were insight, and not, perhaps, the less so because the hill meant villages and food;and you who have doubtless lunched well and lately will please bear inmind I had had nothing since breakfast the day before; and though thismay look picturesque on paper, in practice it is a painful item in one'sprogramme.</p> 
<p>　　Well, I gave my damp clothes but a turn or two more in the sun, andthen, arguing that from the bare ground where the forest ended half-wayup the hill, a wide view would be obtained, hurried into my garments andset off thither right gleefully. A turn or two down the blank streets, nowprosaic enough, an easy scramble through a gap in the crumblingbattlements, and there was the open forest again, with a friendly path wellmarked by the passage of those wild animals who made the city their lairtrending towards my landmark.</p> 
<p>　　A light breakfast of soft green nuts, plucked on the way, and then theground began to bend upwards and the woods to thin a little. Withinfinite ardour, just before mid- day, I scrambled on to a bare knoll on thevery hillside, and fell exhausted before the top could be reached.</p> 
<p>　　But what were hunger or fatigue to the satisfaction of that moment?</p> 
<p>　　There was the sea before me, the clear, strong, gracious sea, blue leaguesof it, furrowed by the white ridges of some distant storm. I could smellthe scent of it even here, and my sailor heart rose in pride at the&nbsp; companion- ship of that alien ocean. Lovely and blessed thing! howoften have I turned from the shallow trivialities of the land and foundconsolation in the strength of your stately soli- tudes! How often have Iturned from the tinselled presence of the shore, the infinite pretensions ofdry land that make life a sorry, hectic sham, and found in the black bosomof the Great Mother solace and comfort! Dear, lovely sea, man- half ofevery sphere, as far removed in the sequence of your strong emotions fromthe painted fripperies of the woman-land as pole from pole--the gratefulblessing of the humblest of your followers on you!</p> 
<p>　　The mere sight of salt water did me good. Heaven knows ourseparation had not been long, and many an unkind slap has the Mothergiven me in the bygone; yet the mere sight of her was tonic, a lethe oftroubles, a sedative for tired nerves; and I gazed that morning at theillimitable blue, the great, unfettered road to everywhere, the ever- varied,the immutable, the thing which was before every- thing and shall be last ofall, in an ecstasy of affection.</p> 
<p>　　There was also other satisfaction at hand. Not a mile away lay awell-defined road--doubtless the one spoken of by the wood-cutter--andwhere the track pointed to the seashore the low roofs and circling smokeof a Thither town- ship showed.</p> 
<p>　　There I went hot-footed, and, much too hungry to be nice in formality,swung up to the largest building on the waterside quay and demandedbreakfast of the man who was lounging by its doorway chewing a honeyreed. He looked me up and down without emotion, then, falling into thecommon mistake, said,"This is not a hostel for ghosts, sir. We do not board and lodgephantoms here; this is a dry fish shop.""Thrice blessed trade!" I answered. "Give me some dried fish, goodfellow, or, for the matter of that, dried horse or dog, or anything mortalteeth can bite through, and I will show you my tastes are altogethermundane."But he shook his head. "This is no place for the likes of you, whocome, mayhap, from the city of Yang or some other abode of disembodiedspirits--you, who come for mischief and pay harbourage with mischance- is it likely you could eat wholesome food?""Indeed I could, and plenty of it, seeing I have dined and breakfastedalong the hedges with the blackbirds this two days. Look here, I will payin advance. Will that get me a meal?" and, whipping out my knife, cutoff another of my fast-receding coat buttons.</p> 
<p>　　The man took it with great interest, as I hoped he would, the yellowmetal being apparently a very scarce commodity in his part of the planet.</p> 
<p>　　"Gold?" he asked.</p> 
<p>　　"Well--ahem! I forgot to ask the man who sewed them on for mewhat they were exactly, but it looks like gold, doesn't it?""Yes," he answered, turning it to and fro admiringly in his hand, "youare the first ghost I ever knew to pay in ad- vance, and plenty of them goto and fro through here. Such a pretty thing is well worth a meal--if,indeed, you can stomach our rough fare. Here, you woman within," hecalled to the lady whom I presume was his wife, "here is a gentleman fromthe nether regions who wants some break- fast and has paid in advance.</p> 
<p>　　Give him some of your best, for he has paid well.""And what," said a female voice from inside, "what if I refused toserve another of these plaguy wanderers you are always foisting uponme?""Don't mind her tongue, sir. It's the worst part of her, though she ismighty proud of it. Go in and she will see you do not come out hungry,"and the Thither man returned calmly to his honey stick.</p> 
<p>　　"Come on, you Soul-with-a-man's-stomach," growled the woman, andtoo hungry to be particular about the tone of invitation, I strode into theparlour of that strange refreshment place. The woman was the first I hadseen of the outer race, and better than might have been expected inappearance. Big, strong, and ruddy, she was a mental shock after theslender slips of girlhood on the far side of the water, half a dozen of whomshe could have carried off without effort in her long arms. Yet there wasabout her the credential of rough health, the dignity of muscle, an uprightcarriage, an animal grace of movement, and withal a comely thoughstrongly featured face, which pleased me at once, and later on I had greatcause to remember her with gratitude. She eyed me sulkily for a minute,&nbsp; then her frown gradually softened, and the instinctive love of the womanfor the supernatural mastered her other feelings.</p> 
<p>　　"Is that how you looked in another world?" she asked.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes, exactly, cap to boots. What do you think of the attire, ma'am?""Not much," replied the good woman frankly. "It could not havebeen becoming even when new, and you appear as though you had taken amuddy road since then. What did you die of?""I will tell you so much as this, madam--that what I am like to die ofnow is hunger, plain, unvarnished hunger, so, in Heaven's name, get outwhat you have and let me fall-to, for my last meal was yesterdaymorning."Whereat, with a shrug of her shoulders at the eccentric- ities of netherfolk, the woman went to the rear of the house, and presently came backwith a meal which showed her husband had done scant justice to theestablishment by calling it a dry fish shop. It is true, fish supplied thestaple of the repast, as was inevitable in a seaport, but, like all Martian fish,it was of ambrosial kind, with a savour about it of wine and sunshine suchas no fish on our side of space can boast of. Then there were cakes,steaming and hot, vegetables which fitted into the previous course withexquisite nicety, and, lastly, a wooden tankard of the in- variable Thitherbeer to finish off. Such a meal as a hungry man might consider himselffortunate to meet with any day.</p> 
<p>　　The woman watched me eat with much satisfaction, and when I hadanswered a score of artless questions about my previous state, or presentcondition and prospects, more or less to her satisfaction, she supplied mein turn with some information which was really valuable to me just then.</p> 
<p>　　First I learned that Ar-hap's men, with the abducted Heru, had passedthrough this very port two days before, and by this time were probably inthe main town, which, it appeared, was only about twelve hours' rowingup the salt- water estuary outside. Here was news! Heru, the prize andobject of my wild adventure, close at hand and well. It brought a wholenew train of thoughts, for the last few days had been so full of the stress oftravel, the bare, hard necessity of getting forward, that the object of myquest, illogical as it may seem, had gone into the background before these&nbsp; things. And here again, as I finished the last cake and drank down to thebottom of the ale tankard, the extreme folly of the venture came upon me,the madness of venturing single-handed into the den of the Wood King.</p> 
<p>　　What had I to hope for? What chance, however remote, was there ofsuccessfully wresting that blooming prize from the arms of her captor?</p> 
<p>　　Force was out of the question; stealth was utterly impractical; as forcajolery, apparently the sole remaining means of winning back thePrincess--why, one might as well try the persuasion of a penny flute upona hungry eagle as seek to rouse Ar-hap's sympathies for bereaved Hath inthat way. Surely to go forward would mean my own certain destruction,with no advantage, no help to Heru; and if I was ever to turn back or stopin the idle quest, here was the place and time. My Hither friends werebehind the sea; to them I could return before it was too late, and here werethe rough but honest Thither folk, who would doubtless let me liveamongst them if that was to be my fate. One or other alternative werebetter than going to torture and death.</p> 
<p>　　"You seem to take the fate of that Hither girl of yours mightily to heart,stranger," quoth my hostess, with a touch of feminine jealousy, as shewatched my hesitation. "Do you know anything of her?""Yes," I answered gloomily. "I have seen her once or twice away inSeth.""Ah, that reminds me! When they brought her up here from the boatsto dry her wet clothes, she cried and called in her grief for just such a oneas you, saying he alone who struck down our men at her feast could rescueher--""What! Heru here in this room but yesterday! How did she look?</p> 
<p>　　Was she hurt? How had they treated her?"My eagerness gave me away. The woman looked at me through herhalf-shut eyes a space, and then said, "Oh! sits the wind in THAT quarter?</p> 
<p>　　So you can love as well as eat. I must say you are well-conditioned for aspirit."I got up and walked about the room a space, then, feeling veryfriendless, and knowing no woman was ever born who was not interestedin another woman's loves, I boldly drew my hostess aside and told her&nbsp; about Heru, and that I was in pursuit of her, dwelling on the girl's gentlehelplessness, my own hare-brained adventure, and frankly asking whatsort of a sovereign Ar-hap was, what the customs of his court might be,and whether she could suggest any means, tem- poral or spiritual, bywhich he might be moved to give back Heru to her kindred.</p> 
<p>　　Nor was my confidence misplaced. The woman, as I guessed, wastouched somewhere back in her female heart by my melting love-tale, bymy anxiety and Heru's peril. Besides, a ghost in search of a fairy lady--andsuch the slender folk of Seth were still considered to be by the race whichhad supplanted them--this was romance indeed. To be brief, that goodwoman proved invaluable.</p> 
<p>　　She told me, firstly, that Ar-hap was believed to be away at war,"weekending" as was his custom, amongst rebellious tribes, and bystarting at once up the water, I should very probably get to the town beforehe did. Sec- ondly, she thought if I kept clear of private brawls there waslittle chance of my receiving injury, from the people at all events, as theywere accustomed to strange visitors, and civil enough until they were firedby war. "Sickle cold, sword hot," was one of their proverbs, meaningthereby that in peaceful times they were lambs, however lionlike theymight be in contest.</p> 
<p>　　This was reassuring, but as to recovering the lady, that was anothermatter over which the good woman shook her head. It was ill comingbetween Ar-hap and his tribute, she said; still, if I wanted to see Heru onceagain, this was my op- portunity, and, for the rest, that chance, which oftenfavours the enamoured, must be my help.</p> 
<p>　　Briefly, though I should probably have gone forward in any case out ofsheer obstinacy, had it been to certain destruction, this better aspect of thesituation hastened my resolution. I thanked the woman for help, and thenthe man outside was called in to advise as to the best and speediest way ofgetting within earshot of his hairy sovereignty, the monarch of</p>
