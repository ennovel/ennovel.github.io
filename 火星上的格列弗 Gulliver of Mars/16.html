<p>　　It was not altogether a romantic approach to the dungeon of an imprisonedbeauty, but it was practical, which is often better if not so pleasant. Sothe offer was gladly closed with, and curling myself in a rug of foxskins,for I was tired with much walking, sailors never being good foot- gangers,I slept soundly fill they came to tell me it was time to go on board.</p> 
<p>　　The vessel was more like a canal barge than anything else, lean andlong, with the cargo piled in a ridge down the centre as farmers store theirwinter turnips, the rowers sitting on either side of this plying oars likedessert-spoons with long handles, while they chanted a monotonouscadence of monosyllables:</p> 
<p>　　Oh, ho, oh,Oh, ho, oh,How high, how high.</p> 
<p>　　and then again after a pause-How high, how highOh, ho, oh,Oh, ho, oh.</p> 
<p>　　the which was infinitely sleep-provoking if not a refrain of a highintellectual order.</p> 
<p>　　I shut my eyes as we pulled away from the wharfs of that namelessemporium and picked a passage through a crowd of quaint shipping,wondering where I was, and asking myself whether I was mentally risingequal to my extraordinary surroundings, whether I adequately appreciated the immensity of my remove from those other seas on which I hadlast travelled, tiller-ropes in hand, piloting a captain's galley from a wharf.</p> 
<p>　　Good heavens, what would my comrades on my ship say if they could seeme now steer- ing a load of hairy savages up one of those waterwayswhich our biggest telescopes magnify but to the thickness of an indication?</p> 
<p>　　No, I was not rising equal to the oc- casion, and could not. The humanmind is of but limited capacity after all, and such freaks of fortune arebeyond its conception. I knew I was where I was, but I knew I shouldprobably never get the chance of telling of it, and that no one would everbelieve me if I did, and I re- signed myself to the inevitable with sullenacquiescence, smothering the wonder that might have been overwhelmingin passing interests of the moment.</p> 
<p>　　There is little to record of that voyage. We passed through a fleet ofAr-hap's warships, empty and at anchor in double line, serviceable half-decked cutters, built of solid timber, not pumpkin rind it was pleasant tonotice, and then the town dropped away as we proceeded up a streamabout as broad as the Hudson at its widest, and profusely studded withislands. This water was bitterly salt and joined an- other sea on the otherside of the Martian continent. Yet it had a pronounced flow against useastward, this tide running for three spring months and being followed, Ilearned, as ocean temperatures varied, by a flow in the opposite directionthroughout the summer.</p> 
<p>　　Just at present the current was so strong eastwards, the moisturebeaded upon my rowers' tawny hides as they strug- gled against it, andtheir melancholy song dawdled in "linked sweetness long drawn out,"while the swing of their oars grew longer and longer. Truly it was veryhot, far hotter than was usual for the season, these men declared, and possibly this robbed me of my wonted energy, and you, gentle reader, of adescription of all the strange things we passed upon that highway.</p> 
<p>　　Suffice it to say we spent a scorching afternoon, the greater part of astifling night moored under a mud-bank with a grove of trees on top fromwhich gigantic fire-flies hung as though the place were illuminated for agarden fete, and then, rowing on again in the comparatively cool hoursbefore dawn, turned into a backwater at cock-crow.</p> 
<p>　　The skipper of our cargo boat roused me just as we turned, puttingunder my sleepy nostrils a handful of toasted beans on a leaf, and a smallcup full of something that was not coffee, but smelt as good as thatmatutinal beverage always does to the tired traveller.</p> 
<p>　　Over our prow was an immense arch of foliage, and under- neath a&nbsp; long arcade of cool black shadows, sheltering still water, till water andshadow suddenly ended a quarter of a mile down in a patch of brilliantcolour. It was as peaceful as could be in the first morning light, and tome over all there was the inexpressible attraction of the unknown.</p> 
<p>　　As our boat slipped silently forward up this leafy lane, a thin white"feather" in her mouth alone breaking the steely surface of the stream, themen rested from their work and began, as sailors will, to put on theirshore-going clothes, the while they chatted in low tones over the profits ofthe voyage. Overhead flying squirrels were flitting to and fro like bats,or shelling fruit whereof the husks fell with a pleasant splash about us, andon one bank a couple of early mothers were washing their babies, whosesmothered protests were almost the only sound in this morning world.</p> 
<p>　　Another silent dip or two of the oars and the colour ahead crystallisedinto a town. If I said it was like an African village on a large scale, Ishould probably give you the best description in the fewest words. Fromthe very water's edge up to the crown of a low hill inland, extended a massof huts and wooden buildings, embowered and partly hidden in brightgreen foliage, with here and there patches of millet, or some such foodplant, and the flowers that grow everywhere so abundantly in this country.</p> 
<p>　　It was all Arcadian and peaceful enough at the moment, and as we drewnear the men were just coming out to the quays along the har- bour front,the streets filling and the town waking to busy life.</p> 
<p>　　A turn to the left through a watergate defended by towers of wood andmud, and we were in the city harbour itself; boats of many kinds mooredon every side; quaint craft from the gulfs and bays of Nowhere, full ofunheard-of merch- andise, and manned by strange-faced crews, everyvessel a romance of nameless seas, an epitome of an undiscovered world,and every moment the scene grew busier as the breakfast smoke arose, andwharf and gangway set to work upon the day's labours.</p> 
<p>　　Our boat--loaded, as it turned out, with spoil from Seth-- was run to aplace of honour at the bottom of the town square, and was an object ofmuch curiosity to a small crowd which speedily collected and lent a handwith the mooring ropes, the while chatting excitedly with the crew aboutfurther tribute and the latest news from overseas. At the same time a&nbsp; swarthy barbarian, whose trappings showed him to be some sort offunctionary, came down to our "captain," much wagging of heads andcounting of notched sticks taking place between them.</p> 
<p>　　I, indeed, was apparently the least interesting item of the cargo, andthis was embarrassing. No hero likes to be ne- glected, it is fatal to hispart. I had said my prayers and steeled myself to all sorts of fineendurance on the way up, and here, when it came to the crisis, no one wasanxious to play the necessary villain. They just helped me ashore civillyenough, the captain nodded his head at me, mutter- ing something in anindifferent tone to the functionary about a ghost who had wanderedoverseas and begged a passage up the canal; the group about the quaystared a little, but that was all.</p> 
<p>　　Once I remember seeing a squatting, life-size heathen idol hoistedfrom a vessel's hold and deposited on a sugar-box on a New York quay.</p> 
<p>　　Some ribald passer-by put a battered felt hat upon Vishnu's sacred curls,and there the poor image sat, an alien in an indifferent land, a sack acrossits shoulders, a "billycock" upon its head, and honoured at most with apassing stare. I thought of that lonely image as al- most as lonely I stoodon the Thither men's quay, without the support of friends or heroics,wondering what to do next.</p> 
<p>　　However, a cheerful disposition is sometimes better than a bankingaccount, and not having the one I cultivated the other, sunning myselfamongst the bales for a time, and then, since none seemed interested in me,wandered off into the town, partly to satisfy my curiosity, and partly in thevague hope of ascertaining if my princess was really here, and, if possible,getting sight of her.</p> 
<p>　　Meanwhile it turned hot with a supernatural, heavy sort of heataltogether, I overheard passersby exclaiming, out of the common, and afterwandering for an hour through gardens and endless streets of thatched huts,I was glad enough to throw myself down in the shadow of some trees onthe outskirts of the great central pile of buildings, a whole village in itselfof beam-built towers and dwelling- place, suggesting by its superior sizethat it might actually be Ar-hap's palace.</p> 
<p>　　Hotter and hotter it grew, while a curious secondary sunrise in the west,&nbsp; the like of which I never saw before seemed to add to the heat, and heavierand heavier my eye- lids, till I dozed at last, and finally sleptuncomfortably for a time.</p> 
<p>　　Rousing up suddenly, imagine my surprise to see sitting, chin on knees,about a yard away, a slender girlish figure, infinitely out of place in thatworld of rough barbarians. Was it possible? Was I dreaming? No, therewas no doubt about it, she was a girl of the Hither folk, slim and pretty,but with a wonderfully sad look in her gazelle eyes, and scarcely a sign ofthe indolent happiness of Seth in the pale little face regarding me sofixedly.</p> 
<p>　　"Good gracious, miss," I said, still rubbing my eyes and doubting mysenses, "have you dropped from the skies? You are the very last person Iexpected to see in this barbarian place.""And you too, sir. Oh, it is lovely to see one so newly from home,and free-seeming--not a slave.""How did you know I was from Seth?""Oh, that was easy enough," and with a little laugh she pointed to apebble lying between us, on which was a piece of battered sweetmeat in aperforated bamboo box. Poor An had given me something just like thatin a playful mood, and I had kept it in my pocket for her sake, being, asyou will have doubtless observed, a sentimental young man, and now Iclapped my hand where it should have been, but it was gone.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes," said my new friend, "that is yours. I smelt the sweetmeatcoming up the hill, and crossed the grass until I found you here asleep.</p> 
<p>　　Oh, it was lovely! I took it from your pocket, and white Seth rose upbefore my swimming eyes, even at the scent of it. I am Si, well named,for that in our land means sadness, Si, the daughter of Prince Hath's chiefsweetmeat-maker, so I should know something of such stuff. May I,please, nibble a little piece?""Eat it all, my lass, and welcome. How came you here? But I canguess. Do not answer if you would rather not.""Ay, but I will. It is not every day I can speak to ears so friendly asyours. I am a slave, chosen for my luckless beauty as last year's tributeto Ar-hap.""And now?""And now the slave of Ar-hap's horse-keeper, set aside to make roomfor a fresher face.""And do you know whose face that is?""Not I, a hapless maid sent into this land of horrors, to bear ignominyand stripes, to eat coarse food and do coarse work, the miserable playthingof some brute in semi-human form, with but the one consolation of dyingearly as we tribute-women always die. Poor comrade in exile, I onlyknow her as yet by sympathy.""What if I said it was Heru, the princess?"The Martian girl sprang to her feet, and clasping her hands exclaimed,"Heru, the Slender! Then the end comes, for it is written in ourbooks that the last tribute is paid when the best is paid. Oh, how splendidif she gave herself of free will to this slavery to end it once for all. Was itso?""I think, Si, your princess could not have known of that tradition; shedid not come willingly. Besides, I am come to fetch her back, if it maybe, and that spoils the look of sacrifice.""You to fetch her back, and from Ar-hap's arms? My word, Sir Spirit,you must know some potent charms; or, what is less likely, mycountrymen must have amazingly improved in pluck since I left them.</p> 
<p>　　Have you a great army at hand?"But I only shook my head, and, touching my sword, said that here wasthe only army coming to rescue Heru. Whereon the lady replied that shethought my valour did me more honour than my discretion. How did Ipropose to take the princess from her captors?</p> 
<p>　　"To tell the truth, damsel, that is a matter which will have to be left toyour invention, or the kindness of such as you. I am here on a harebrained errand, playing knight- errant in a way that shocks my commonsense. But since the matter has gone so far I will see it through, or die inthe attempt. Your bully lord shall either give me Heru, stock, lock, andblock, or hang me from a yard-arm. But I would rather have the lady.</p> 
<p>　　Come, you will help me; and, as a beginning, if she is in yonder shanty getme speech with her."Poor Si's eyes dilated at the peril of the suggestion, and I saw thesluggish Martian nature at war against her better feelings. But presentlythe latter conquered. "I will try," she said. "What matter a few stripesmore or less?" pointing to her rosy shoulders where red scars crisscrossupon one an- other showed how the Martian girls fared in Ar-hap's palacewhen their novelty wore off. "I will try to help you; and if they kill mefor it--why, that will not matter much." And forthwith in that blazingforenoon under the flickering shadow of the trees we put our headstogether to see what we might do for Heru.</p> 
<p>　　It was not much for the moment. Try what we would that afternoon,I could not persuade those who had charge of the princess to let me evenapproach her place of im- prisonment, but Si, as a woman, was moresuccessful, actually seeing her for a few moments, and managed towhisper in her ear that I had come, the Spirit-with-the-gold-buttonsdown-his front, afterwards describing to me in flowing Mar- tian imagery-but doubtless not more highly coloured than poor Heru's emotionwarranted--how delightedly that lady had received the news.</p> 
<p>　　Si also did me another service, presenting me to the porter's wife, whokept a kind of boarding-house at the gates of Ar-hap's palace forgentlemen and ladies with grievances. I had heard of lobbying before,and the pre- sentation of petitions, though I had never indulged myself inthe pastime; but the crowd of petitioners here, with petitions as wild andpicturesque as their own motley ap- pearances, was surely the strangestthat ever gathered round a seat of supreme authority.</p> 
<p>　　Si whispered in the ear of that good woman the nature of my errand,with doubtless some blandishment of her own; and my errand being one somuch above the vulgar and so nearly touching the sovereign, I was at onceac- corded a separate room in the gate-house, whence I could look down incomparative peace on the common herd of suitors, and listen to the buzzof their invective as they practised speeches which I calculated it wouldtake Ar-hap all the rest of his reign to listen to, without allowing him anytime for pronouncing verdicts on them.</p> 
<p>　　Here I made myself comfortable, and awaited the return of thesovereign as placidly as might be. Meanwhile fate was playing into my&nbsp; feeble hands.</p> 
<p>　　I have said it was hot weather. At first this seemed but an outcome ofthe Martian climate, but as the hours went by the heat developed to anincredible extent. Also that red glare previously noted in the west grewin intensity, till, as the hours slipped by, all the town was staring at it inpanting horror. I have seen a prairie on fire, luckily from the far side of acomfortably broad river, and have ridden through a pine- forest whenevery tree for miles was an uplifted torch, and pungent yellow smokerolled down each corrie side in grey rivers crested with dancing flame.</p> 
<p>　　But that Martian glare was more sombre and terrible than either.</p> 
<p>　　"What is it?" I asked of poor Si, who came out gasping to speak to meby the gate-house.</p> 
<p>　　"None of us know, and unless the gods these Thither folk believe inare angry, and intend to destroy the world with yonder red sword in thesky, I cannot guess. Perhaps," she added, with a sudden flash ofinspiration, "it comes by your machinations for Heru's help.""No!""If not by your wish, then, in the name of all you love, set your wishagainst it. If you know any incantations suitable for the occasion, oh,practise them now at once, for look, even the very grass is withering; birdsare dropping from trees; fishes, horribly bloated, are beginning to floatdown the steaming rills; and I, with all others, have a nameless dread uponme."Hotter and hotter it grew, until about sunset the red blaze upon the skyslowly opened, and showed us for about half an hour, through the openinga lurid, flame-coloured meteor far out in space beyond; then the cleftclosed again, and through that abominable red curtain came the verybreath of Hades.</p> 
<p>　　What was really happening I am not astronomer enough to say, thoughon cooler consideration I have come to the conclusion that our planet, ingoing out to its summer pastures in the remoter fields of space, hadsomehow come across a wandering lesser world and got pretty well singedin passing. This is purely my own opinion, and I have not yet submittedit to the kindly authorities of the Lick Obser- vatory for verification. All&nbsp; I can say for certain is that in an incredibly short space of time the face ofthe country changed from green to sear, flowers drooped; streams (therewere not many in the neighbourhood apparently) dried up; fishes died; amighty thirst there was nothing to quench set- tled down on man and beast,and we all felt that unless Providence listened to the prayers andimprecations which the whole town set to work with frantic zeal to hurl atit, or that abominable comet in the sky sheered off on another tack withthe least possible delay, we should all be re- duced to cinders in a verybrief space of time.</p>
