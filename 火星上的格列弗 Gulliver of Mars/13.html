<p>　　The land was no longer fat and flowery, giving every kind of producefor the asking, but stony for the most part, and, where we first came onvegetation, overgrown by firs, with a pine which looked to me like aspecies which went to make the coal measures in my dear but distantplanet. More than this I cannot say, for there are no places in the worldlike mess-room and quarter-deck for forgetting school learn- ing. Insteadof the glorious wealth of parti-coloured vege- tation my eyes had beenaccustomed to lately, here they rested on infertile stretches of marshlandintersected by moss-covered gravel shoots, looking as though they hadbeen pushed into the plains in front of extinct glaciers coming down fromthe region behind us. On the low hills away from the sea those sombreevergreen forests with an undergrowth of moss and red lichens were morevariegated with light foliage, and indeed the pines proved to be but afringe to the Arctic ice, giving way rapidly to more typical Martianvegetation each mile we marched to the southward.</p> 
<p>　　As for the inhabitants, they seemed, like my guide, rough, uncouthfellows, but honest enough when you came to know them. Anintroduction, however, was highly desirable. I chanced upon the firstnative as he was gathering reindeer- moss. My companion was somelittle way behind at the moment, and when the gentle aborigine saw thestranger he stared hard for a moment, then, turning on his heels, withextraordinary swiftness flung at me half a pound of hard flint stone. Hadhis aim been a little more careful this humble narrative had never appearedon the Broadway bookstalls. As it was, the pebble, missing my head byan inch or two, splintered into a hundred fragments on a rock behind, andwhile I was debating whether a revengeful rush at the slinger or a strategicadvance to the rear were more advisable, my guide called out to hiscountryman-"Ho! you base prowler in the morasses; you eater of un- clean&nbsp; vegetation, do you not see this is a ghost I am con- ducting, a dweller inthe ice cliffs, a spirit ten thousand years old? Put by your sling lest hewither you with a glance." And, very reasonably, surprised, the aboriginedid as he was bid and cautiously advanced to inspect me.</p> 
<p>　　The news soon spread over the countryside that my jewel- hunter wasbringing a live "spook" along with him, con- siderable curiosity mixedwith an awe all to my advantage characterising the people we metthereafter. Yet the won- der was not so great as might have beenexpected, for these people were accustomed to meeting the tags of lostraces, and though they stared hard, their interest was chiefly in hearinghow, when, and where I had been found, whether I bit or kicked, or hadany other vices, and if I possessed any commercial value.</p> 
<p>　　My guide's throat must have ached with the repetition of the narrative,but as he made the story redound greatly to his own glory, he put upcheerfully with the hoarseness. In this way, walking and talking alternately,we travelled during daylight through a country which slowly lost itsrugged features and became more and more inhabited, the hardy peopleliving in scattered villages in contradiction to the debased city-lovingHither folk.</p> 
<p>　　About nightfall we came to a sea-fishers' hamlet, where, after the oldman had explained my exalted nature and ven- erable antiquity, I wasoffered shelter for the night.</p> 
<p>　　My host was the headman, and I must say his bearing towards thesupernatural was most unaffected. If it had been an Avenue hotel I couldnot have found more handsome treatment than in that reed-thatched hut.</p> 
<p>　　They made me wash and rest, and then were all agog for my history; butthat I postponed, contenting myself with telling them I had been lately inSeth, and had come thence to see them via the ice valley--to all of whichthey listened with the simplicity of children. Afterwards I turned onthem, and openly mar- velled that so small a geographical distance as therewas between that land and this could make so vast a human difference.</p> 
<p>　　"The truth, O dweller in blue shadows of primordial ice, is," said the mostintelligent of the Thither folk as we sat over fried deer-steak in his hut thatevening, "we who are MEN, not Peri-zad, not overstayed fairies like those&nbsp; you have been amongst, are newcomers here on this shore. We came buta few generations ago from where the gold curtains of the sun lie behindthe westward pine-trees, and as we came we drove, year by year, thosefays, those spent triflers, back before us. All this land was theirs once,and more and more towards our old home. You may still see traces ofharbours dug and cities built thousands of years ago, when the Hither folkwere living men and women-- not their shadows. The big water outsidestops us for a space, but," he added, laughing gruffly and taking a draughtof a strong beer he had been heating by the fire, "King Ar-hap has theirpretty noses between his fingers; he takes tribute and girls while he getsready--they say he is nearly ready this summer, and if he is, it will not bemuch of an excuse he will need to lick up the last of those triflers, thosepretences of manhood."Then we fell to talking of Ar-hap, his subjects and town, and I learnedthe tides had swept me a long way to the northward of the proper routebetween the capitals of the two races, that day they carried me into theDead-Men's Ice, as these entertainers of mine called the northern snows.</p> 
<p>　　To get back to the place previously aimed at, where the woodmen roadcame out on the seashore, it was necessary to go either by boat, aroundabout way through a maze of channels, "as tangled as the grass rootsin autumn"; or, secondly, by a couple of days' marching due southwardacross the base of the great peninsula we were on, and so strike blue wateragain at the long-sought-for harbour.</p> 
<p>　　As I lay dozing and dreaming on a pile of strange furs in the corner ofthe hut that evening I made up my mind for the land journey tomorrow,having had enough for the mo- ment of nautical Martian adventures; andthis point settled, fell again to wondering what made me follow so recklessa quest in the way I was doing; asking myself again and again what wasgazelle-eyed Heru to me after all, and why should it matter even as muchas the value of a brass waist- coat button whether Hath had her or Ar-hap?</p> 
<p>　　What a fool I was to risk myself day by day in quaint and dangerousadventures, wearing out good Government shoe-leather in other men'squarrels, all for a silly slip of royal girlhood who, by this time, wasprobably making herself comfortable and forgetting both Hath and me in&nbsp; the arms of her rough new lord.</p> 
<p>　　And from Heru my mind drifted back dreamily to poor An, and Seth,the city of fallen magnificence, where the spent masters of a strange planetnow lived on suffer- ance--the ghosts of their former selves. Where wasAn, where the revellers on the morning--so long ago it seemed!--whenfirst that infernal rug of mine translated a chance wish into a horriblereality and shot me down here, a stranger and an outcast? Where was themagic rug itself? Where my steak and tomato supper? Who had eaten it?</p> 
<p>　　Who was drawing my pay? If I could but find the rug when I got back toSeth, gods! but I would try if it would not return whence I had come, andas swiftly, out of all these silly coils and adventuring.</p> 
<p>　　So musing, presently the firelight died down, and bulky forms of hide-wrapped woodmen sleeping on the floor slowly disappeared in obscuritylike ranges of mountains disappearing in the darkness of night. All thoseuncouth forms, and the throb of the sea outside, presently faded upon mysenses, and I slept the heavy sleep of one whose wakefulness gives waybefore an imperious physical demand. All through the long hours of thenight, while the waves outside champed upon the gravels, and thewoodmen snored and grunted uneasily as they simultaneously dreamt ofthe day's hunting and digested its proceeds, I slept; and then when dawnbegan to break I passed from that heavy stupor into another and lighterrealm, wherein fancy again rose superior to bodily fatigue, and events ofthe last few days passed in procession through my mind.</p> 
<p>　　I dreamt I was lunching at a fashionable seaside resort with Polly atmy side, and An kept bringing us melons, which grew so monstrous everytime a knife was put into them that poor Polly screamed aloud. I dreamtI was afloat on a raft, hotly pursued by my tailor, whose bare and shinyhead--may Providence be good to him!--was garlanded with roses, whilein his fist was a bunch of unpaid bills, the which he waved aloft, shoutingto me to stop. And thus we danced down an ink-black river until he hadchiveyed me into the vast hall of the Admiralty, where a fearsomeSecretary, whose golden teeth rattled and dropped from his head withmingled cold and anger, towered above me as he asked why I was absentfrom my ship without leave. And I was just mumbling out excuses while&nbsp; stooping to pick up his golden dentistry, when some one stirring in the hutaroused me. I started up on my elbow and looked around. Where was I?</p> 
<p>　　For a minute all was confused and dark. The heavy mound-like forms ofsleeping men, the dim outlines of their hunting gear upon the walls, thepale sea beyond, half seen through the open doorway, just turning livid inthe morning light; and then as my eyes grew more ac- customed to theobscurity, and my stupid senses returned, I recognised the surroundings,and, with a sigh, remembered yesterday's adventures. However, it wouldnever do to mope; so, rising silently and picking a way through humanlumber on the floor, I went out and down to the water's edge, where"shore-going" clothes, as we sailors call them, were slipped off, and Iplunged into the sea for a swim.</p> 
<p>　　It was a welcome dip, for I needed the plunge physically andintellectually, but it came to an abrupt conclusion. The Thither folkapparently had never heard of this form of enjoyment; to them water stoodfor drinking or drowning, nothing else, and since one could not drink thesea, to be in it meant, even for a ghost, to drown. Consequently, whenthe word went round the just rousing villages that "He-on-foot- from-afar"was adrift in the waves, rescue parties were hur- riedly organised, a boatlaunched, and, in spite of all my kicking and shouting (which they took tobe evidence of my semi-moribund condition), I was speedily hauled out byhairy and powerful hands, pungent herbs burnt un- der my nose, and myheels held high in the air in order that the water might run out of me. Itwas only with the greatest difficulty those rough but honest fellows wereeventually got to believe me saved.</p> 
<p>　　The breakfast I made of grilled deer flesh and a fish not unlike salmon,however, convinced them of my recovery, and afterward we parted verygood friends; for there was some- thing in the nature of those ruggedbarbarians just coming into the dawn of civilisation that won my liking farmore than the effete gentleness of others across the water.</p> 
<p>　　When the time of parting came they showed no curiosity as to myerrand, but just gave me some food in a fish-skin bag, thrust a heavystone-headed axe into my hand, "in case I had to talk to a thief on theroad," and pointed out on the southern horizon a forked mountain, under&nbsp; which, they said, was the harbour and high-road to King Ar-hap's capital.</p> 
<p>　　Then they hugged me to their hairy chests in turn, and let me go with atraveller's blessing.</p> 
<p>　　There I was again, all alone, none but my thoughts for companions,and nothing but youth to excuse the folly in thus venturing on a recklessquest!</p> 
<p>　　However, who can gainsay that same youth? The very spice of dangermade my steps light and the way pleasant. For a mile or two the track wasplain enough, through an undulating country gradually becoming moreand more wooded with vegetation, changing rapidly from Alpine to subtropical. The air also grew warmer, and when the divid- ing ridge wascrossed and a thick forest entered, the snows and dreadful region ofDeadmen's Ice already seemed leagues and leagues away.</p> 
<p>　　Probably a warm ocean current played on one side of the peninsula,while a cold one swept the other, but for sci- entific aspects of the questionI cared little in my joy at being anew in a soft climate, amongst beautifulflowers and vivid life again. Mile after mile slipped quickly by as Istrode along, whistling "Yankee Doodle" to myself and revelling in thechange. At one place I met a rough-looking Martian woodcutter, whowanted to fight until he found I also wanted to, when he turned very civiland as talkative as a solitary liver often is when his tongue gets started.</p> 
<p>　　He particularly desired to know where I came from, and, as in the casewith so many other of his countrymen, took it for granted, and with verylittle surprise, that I was either a spirit or an inhabitant of another world.</p> 
<p>　　With this idea in his mind he gave me a curious piece of information,which, unfortunately, I was never able to follow up.</p> 
<p>　　"I don't think you can be a spirit," he said, critically eyeing my clothes,which were now getting ragged and dirty beyond description. "They arefiner-looking things than you, and I doubt if their toes come through theirshoes like yours do. If you are a wanderer from the stars, you are not likethat other one we have down yonder," and he pointed to the southward.</p> 
<p>　　"What!" I asked, pricking my ears in amazement, "an- other wandererfrom the outside world! Does he come from the earth?"--using the wordAn had given me to signify my own planet.</p> 
<p>　　"No, not from there; from the one that burns blue in evening betweensun and sea. Men say he worked as a stoker or something of the kindwhen he was at home, and got trifling with a volcano tap, and was lappedin hot mud, and blown out here. My brother saw him about a week ago.""Now what you say is down right curious. I thought I had amonopoly of that kind of business in this sphere of yours. I should betremendously interested to see him.""No you wouldn't," briefly answered the woodman. "He is thestupidest fool ever blown from one world to another-- more stupid to lookat than you are. He is a gaseous, wavey thing, so glum you can't get twowords a week out of him, and so unstable that you never know when youare with him and when the breeze has drifted him somewhere else."I could but laugh and insist, with all respect to the woodcutter, such anindividual were worth the knowing however unstable his constitution; atwhich the man shrugged his shoulders and changed the conversation, asthough the subject were too trivial to be worth much consideration.</p> 
<p>　　This individual gave me the pleasure of his company until nearlysundown, and finding I took an interest in things of the forest, pointed outmore curious plants and trees than I have space to mention. Two of them,however, cling to my memory very tenaciously. One was a very Circeamongst plants, the horrible charm of which can never be forgotten. Wewere going down a glade when a most ravishing odour fell upon mynostrils. It was heavenly sweet yet withal there lurked an incredibly,unexpressibly tempting spice of wickedness in it. The moment he caughtthat ambrosial invitation in the air my woodman spit fiercely on theground, and taking a plug of wool from his pouch stuffed his nostrils up.</p> 
<p>　　Then he beckoned me to come away. But the odour was too ravishing, Iwas bound to see whence it arose, and finding me deaf to all warnings, theman reluctantly turned aside down the enticing trail. We pushed about ahundred yards through bushes until we came to a little arena full insunshine where there were neither birds nor butterflies, but a death-likehush upon everything. Indeed, the place seemed shunned in spite of thesodden loveliness of that scent which monopolised and mounted to mybrain until I was beginning to be drunk with the sheer pleasure of it. And&nbsp; there in the centre of the space stood a plant not unlike a tree fern, aboutsix feet high, and crowned by one huge and lovely blossom. It resembleda vast passion-flower of incredible splendour. There were four petals,with points resting on the ground, each six feet long, ivory-white inside,exquisitely patterned with glittering silver veins. From the base of theserose upright a gauzy veil of azure filaments of the same length as thepetals, wirelike, yet soft as silk, and inside them again rested a chalice ofsilver holding a tiny pool of limpid golden honey. Circe, indeed! It wasfrom that cup the scent arose, and my throat grew dry with longing as Ilooked at it; my eyes strained through the blue tendrils towards that liquidnectar, and my giddy senses felt they must drink or die! I glanced at thewoodman with a smile of drunken happiness, then turned tottering legstowards the blossom. A stride up the smooth causeway of white petals, apush through the azure haze, and the wine of the wood enchantress wouldbe mine--molten am- ber wine, hotter and more golden than the sunshine;the fire of it was in my veins, the recklessness of intoxication was on me,life itself as nothing compared to a sip from that chalice, my lips musttaste or my soul would die, and with trembling hand and strained face Ibegan to climb.</p> 
<p>　　But the woodman pulled me back.</p> 
<p>　　"Back, stranger!" he cried. "Those who drink there never live again.""Blessed oblivion! If I had a thousand lives the price were still toocheap," and once more I essayed to scramble up.</p> 
<p>　　But the man was a big fellow, and with nostrils plugged, and eyesaverted from the deadly glamour, he seized me by the collar and threw meback. Three times I tried, three times he hurled me down, far too faintand absorbed to heed the personal violence. Then standing between us,"Look," he said, "look and learn."He had killed a small ape that morning, meaning later on to take its furfor clothing, and this he now unslung from his shoulder, and hitching thehandle of his axe into the loose skin at the back of its neck, cautiouslyadvanced to the witch plant, and gently hoisted the monkey over the bluepalings. The moment its limp, dead feet touched the golden pool ashudder passed through the plant, and a bird some- where far back in the&nbsp; forest cried out in horror. Quick as thought, a spasm of life shot up thetendrils, and like tongues of blue flame they closed round the victim,lapping his miserable body in their embrace. At the same time the petalsbegan to rise, showing as they did so hard, leathery, un- lovely outer rinds,and by the time the woodman was back at my side the flower was closed.</p> 
<p>　　Closer and closer wound the blue tendrils; tighter and tighter closedthe cruel petals with their iron grip, until at last we heard the ape's bonescrackling like dry firewood; then next his head burst, his brains cameoozing through the crevices, while blood and entrails followed themthrough every cranny, and the horrible mess with the overflow of thechalice curled down the stem in a hundred steaming rills, till at last thepetals locked with an ugly snap upon their ghastly meal, and I turned awayfrom the sight in dread and loathing.</p> 
<p>　　That was plant Number One.</p> 
<p>　　Plant Number Two was of milder disposition, and won a hearty laughfor my friendly woodman. In fact, being of a childlike nature, hissuccess as a professor of botany quite pleased him, and not content withanswering my questions, he set to work to find new vegetable surprises,greatly enjoying my wonder and the sense of importance it gave him.</p> 
<p>　　In this way we came, later on in the day, to a spot where herbage wassomewhat scantier, the grass coarse, and soil shallow. Here I espied atree of small size, apparently withered, but still bearing a few parchedleaves on its upper- most twigs.</p> 
<p>　　"Now that," quoth the professor, "is a highly curious tree, and I shouldlike you to make a close acquaintance with it. It grows from a seed in thecourse of a single springtime, perishes in the summer; but a few specimensstand through- out the winter, provided the situation is sheltered, as thisone has done. If you will kindly go down and shake its stem I believeyou will learn something interesting."So, very willing to humour him, away I went to the tree, which wasperfect in every detail, but apparently very dry, clasped it with both hands,and, pulling myself to- gether, gave it a mighty shake. The result wasinstantaneous. The whole thing was nothing but a skin of dust, whence allfibre and sap had gone, and at my touch it dissolved into a cloud of&nbsp; powder, a huge puff of white dust which descended on me as though acouple of flour-bags had been inverted over my head; and as I staggeredout sneez- ing and blinking, white as a miller from face to foot, theMartian burst into a wild, joyous peal of laughter that made the woods ringagain. His merriment was so sincere I had not the heart to be angry, andsoon laughed as loud as he did; though, for the future, I took his botanicales- says with a little more caution.</p>
