I was trying to focus myself on the moment, onthe girl beside me, on what was real and solid, on anything that would keep </p> 
<p>Alice’sdeceitful, meaningless visions out of my head.</p> 
<p>　　We passed Angela Weber, lingering on the sidewalk, discussing an assignmentwith a boy from her Trigonometry class. I scanned her thoughts perfunctorily, </p> 
<p>expectingmore disappointment, only to be surprised by their wistful tenor.</p> 
<p>　　Ah, so there was something Angela wanted. Unfortunately, it wasn’t somethingthat could be easily gift-wrapped.</p> 
<p>　　I felt strangely comforted for a moment, hearing Angela’s hopeless yearning. Asense of kinship that Angela would never know about passed through me, and I was, </p> 
<p>inthat second, at one with the kind human girl.</p> 
<p>　　It was oddly consoling to know that I wasn’t the only one living out a tragic lovestory. Heartbreak was everywhere.</p> 
<p>　　In the next second, I was abruptly and thoroughly irritated. Because Angela’sstory didn’t have to be tragic. She was human and he was human and the difference </p> 
<p>thatseemed so insurmountable in her head was ridiculous, truly ridiculous compared to myown situation. There was no point in her broken heart. What a wasteful sadness, </p> 
<p>whenthere was no valid reason for her not to be with the one she wanted. Why shouldn’t shehave what she wanted? Why shouldn’t this one story have a happy ending?</p> 
<p>　　I wanted to give her a gift… Well, I would give her what she wanted. Knowingwhat I did of human nature, it probably wouldn’t even be very difficult. I sifted </p> 
<p>throughthe consciousness of the boy beside her, the object of her affections, and he did not seemunwilling, he was just stymied by the same difficulty she was. Hopeless </p> 
<p>and resigned,the way she was.</p> 
<p>　　All I would have to do was plant the suggestion…&nbsp; The plan formed easily, the script wrote itself without effort on my part. I wouldneed Emmett’s help—getting </p> 
<p>him to go along with this was the only real difficulty.</p> 
<p>　　Human nature was so much easier to manipulate than vampire nature.</p> 
<p>　　I was pleased with my solution, with my gift for Angela. It was a nice diversionfrom my own problems. Would that mine were as easily fixed.</p> 
<p>　　My mood was slightly improved as Bella and I took our seats. Maybe I should bemore positive. Maybe there was some solution out there for us that was escaping me, </p> 
<p>theway Angela’s obvious solution was so invisible to her. Not likely… But why waste timewith hopelessness? I didn’t have time to waste when it came to Bella. Each </p> 
<p>secondmattered.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Banner entered pulling an ancient TV and VCR. He was skipping through asection he wasn’t particularly interested in—genetic disorders—by showing a movie </p> 
<p>forthe next three days. Lorenzo’s Oil was not a very cheerful piece, but that didn’t stop theexcitement in the room. No notes, no test-able material. Three free days. </p> 
<p>The humansexulted.</p> 
<p>　　It didn’t matter to me, either way. I hadn’t been planning on paying any attentionto anything but Bella.</p> 
<p>　　I did not pull my chair away from hers today, to give myself space to breathe.</p> 
<p>　　Instead, I sat close beside her like any normal human would. Closer than we sat insidemy car, close enough that the left side of my body felt submerged in the heat </p> 
<p>from herskin.</p> 
<p>　　It was a strange experience, both enjoyable and nerve-racking, but I preferred thisto sitting across the table from her. It was more than I was used to, and yet I </p> 
<p>quicklyrealized that it was not enough. I was not satisfied. Being this close to her only made mewant to be closer still. The pull was stronger the closer I got.</p> 
<p>　　I had accused her of being a magnet for danger. Right now, it felt like that wasthe literal truth. I was danger, and, with every inch I allowed myself nearer to </p> 
<p>her, herattraction grew in force.</p> 
<p>　　And then Mr. Banner turned the lights out.</p> 
<p>　　&nbsp; It was odd how much of a difference this made, considering that the lack of lightmeant little to my eyes. I could still see just as perfectly as before. Every </p> 
<p>detail of theroom was clear.</p> 
<p>　　So why the sudden shock of electricity in the air, in this dark that was not dark tome? Was it because I knew that I was the only one who could see clearly? That </p> 
<p>bothBella and I were invisible to the others? Like we were alone, just the two of us, hidden inthe dark room, sitting so close beside one another…My hand moved toward </p> 
<p>her without my permission. Just to touch her hand, tohold it in the darkness. Would that be such a horrific mistake? If my skin bothered her,she only had to pull away…</p> 
<p>I yanked my hand back, folded my arms tightly across my chest and clenched myhands closed. No mistakes. I’d promised myself that I would make no mistakes, nomatter how </p> 
<p>minimal they seemed. If I held her hand, I would only want more—anotherinsignificant touch, another move closer to her. I could feel that. A new kind of desirewas </p> 
<p>growing in me, working to override my self-control.</p> 
<p>　　No mistakes.</p> 
<p>　　Bella folded her arms securely across her own chest, and her hands balled up intofists, just like mine.</p> 
<p>　　What are you thinking? I was dying to whisper the words to her, but the roomwas too quiet to get away with even a whispered conversation.</p> 
<p>　　The movie began, lightening the darkness just a bit. Bella glanced up at me. Shenoted the rigid way I held my body—just like hers—and smiled. Her lips parted </p> 
<p>slightly,and her eyes seemed full of warm invitations.</p> 
<p>　　Or perhaps I was seeing what I wanted to see.</p> 
<p>　　I smiled back; her breathing caught with a low gasp and she looked quickly away.</p> 
<p>　　That made it worse. I didn’t know her thoughts, but I was suddenly positive that Ihad been right before, and that she wanted me to touch her. She felt this </p> 
<p>dangerous desirejust as I did.</p> 
<p>　　Between her body and mine, the electricity hummed.</p> 
<p>　　&nbsp; She didn’t move all through the hour, holding her stiff, controlled pose as I heldmine. Occasionally she would peek at me again, and the humming current would </p> 
<p>joltthrough me with a sudden shock.</p> 
<p>　　The hour passed—slowly, and yet not slowly enough. This was so new, I couldhave sat like this with her for days, just to experience the feeling fully.</p> 
<p>　　I had a dozen different arguments with myself while the minutes passed,rationality struggling with desire as I tried to justify touching her.</p> 
<p>　　Finally, Mr. Banner turned the lights on again.</p> 
<p>　　In the bright fluorescent light, the atmosphere of the room returned to normal.</p> 
<p>　　Bella sighed and stretched, flexing her fingers in front of her. It must have beenuncomfortable for her to hold that position for so long. It was easier for me—</p> 
<p>stillnesscame naturally.</p> 
<p>　　I chuckled at the relieved expression on her face. “Well, that was interesting.”</p> 
<p>　　“Umm,” she murmured, clearly understanding what I referred to, but making nocomment. What I wouldn’t give to hear what she was thinking right now.</p> 
<p>　　I sighed. No amount of wishing was going to help with that.</p> 
<p>　　“Shall we?” I asked, standing.</p> 
<p>　　She made a face and got unsteadily to her feet, her hands splayed out as if shewere afraid she was going to fall.</p> 
<p>　　I could offer her my hand. Or I could place that hand underneath her elbow—justlightly—and steady her. Surely that wouldn’t be such a horrible infraction…No </p> 
<p>mistakes.</p> 
<p>　　She was very quiet as we walked toward the gym. The crease was in evidencebetween her eyes, a sign that she was deep in thought. I, too, was thinking deeply.</p> 
<p>　　One touch of her skin wouldn’t hurt her, my selfish side contended.</p> 
<p>　　I could easily moderate the pressure of my hand. It wasn’t exactly difficult, aslong as I was firmly in control of myself. My tactile sense was better developed </p> 
<p>than ahuman’s; I could juggle a dozen crystal goblets without breaking any of them; I couldstroke a soap bubble without popping it. As long as I was firmly in control</p> 
<p>…Bella was like a soap bubble—fragile and ephemeral. Temporary.</p> 
<p>　　&nbsp; How long would I be able to justify my presence in her life? How much time didI have? Would I have another chance like this chance, like this moment, like this </p> 
<p>second?</p> 
<p>　　She would not always be within my arm’s reach…Bella turned to face me at the gym’s door, and her eyes widened at the expressionon my face. She didn’t speak. I </p> 
<p>looked at myself in the reflection of her eyes and sawthe conflict raging in my own. I watched my face change as my better side lost theargument.</p> 
<p>　　My hand lifted without a conscious command for it to do so. As gently as if shewere made of the thinnest glass, as if she were fragile as a bubble, my fingers </p> 
<p>stroked thewarm skin that covered her cheekbone. It heated under my touch, and I could feel thepulse of blood speed beneath her transparent skin.</p> 
<p>　　Enough, I ordered, though my hand was aching to shape itself to the side of herface. Enough.</p> 
<p>　　It was difficult to pull my hand back, to stop myself from moving closer to herthan I already was. A thousand different possibilities ran through my mind in </p> 
<p>aninstant—a thousand different ways to touch her. The tip of my finger tracing the shape ofher lips. My palm cupping under her chin. Pulling the clip from her hair and </p> 
<p>letting itspill out across my hand. My arms winding around her waist, holding her against thelength of my body.</p> 
<p>　　Enough.</p> 
<p>　　I forced myself to turn, to move away from her. My body moved stiffly—unwilling.</p> 
<p>　　I let my mind linger behind to watch her as I walked swiftly away, almost runningfrom the temptation. I caught Mike Newton’s thoughts—they were the loudest—</p> 
<p>whilehe watched Bella walk past him in oblivion, her eyes unfocused and her cheeks red. Heglowered and suddenly my name was mingled with curses in his head; I couldn’t </p> 
<p>helpgrinning slightly in response.</p> 
<p>　　My hand was tingling. I flexed it and then curled it into a fist, but it continued tosting painlessly.</p> 
<p>　　No, I hadn’t hurt her—but touching her had still been a mistake.</p> 
<p>　　&nbsp; It felt like fire—like the thirsting burn of my throat had spread throughout myentire body.</p> 
<p>　　The next time I was close to her, would I be able to stop myself from touching heragain? And if I touched her once, would I be able to stop at that?</p> 
<p>　　No more mistakes. That was it. Savor the memory, Edward, I told myself grimly,and keep your hands to yourself. That, or I would have to force myself toleave…</p> 
<p>somehow. Because I couldn’t allow myself near her if I insisted on makingerrors.</p> 
<p>　　I took a deep breath and tried to steady my thoughts.</p> 
<p>　　Emmett caught up to me outside the English building.</p> 
<p>　　“Hey, Edward.” He’s looking better. Weird, but better. Happy.</p> 
<p>　　“Hey, Em.” Did I look happy? I supposed, despite the chaos in my head, I feltthat way.</p> 
<p>　　Way to keep your mouth shut, kid. Rosalie wants to rip your tongue out.</p> 
<p>　　I sighed. “Sorry I left you to deal with that. Are you angry with me?”</p> 
<p>　　“Naw. Rose’ll get over it. It was bound to happen anyway.” With what Alicesees coming…Alice’s visions were not what I wanted to think about right now. I stared </p> 
<p>forward,my teeth locking together.</p> 
<p>　　As I searched for a distraction, I caught sight of Ben Cheney entering the Spanishroom ahead of us. Ah—here was my chance to give Angela Weber her gift.</p> 
<p>　　I stopped walking and caught Emmett’s arm. “Hold on a second.”</p> 
<p>　　What’s up?</p> 
<p>　　“I know I don’t deserve it, but would you do me a favor anyway?”</p> 
<p>　　“What is it?” he asked, curious.</p> 
<p>　　Under my breath—and at a speed that would have made the wordsincomprehensible to a human no matter how loud they’d been spoken—I explained tohim what I wanted.</p> 
<p>　　He stared at me blankly when I was done, his thoughts as blank as his face.</p> 
<p>　　“So?” I prompted. “Will you help me do it?”</p> 
<p>　　It took him a minute to respond. “But, why?”</p> 
<p>　　&nbsp; “C’mon, Emmett. Why not?”</p> 
<p>　　Who are you and what have you done with my brother?</p> 
<p>　　“Aren’t you the one who complains that school is always the same? This issomething a little different, isn’t it? Consider it an experiment—an experiment in </p> 
<p>humannature.”</p> 
<p>　　He stared at me for another moment before he caved. “Well, it is different, I’llgive you that… Okay, fine.” Emmett snorted and then shrugged. “I’ll help you.</p> 
<p>”</p> 
<p>　　I grinned at him, feeling more enthusiastic about my plan now that he was onboard. Rosalie was a pain, but I would always owe her one for choosing Emmett; no onehad </p> 
<p>a better brother than mine.</p> 
<p>　　Emmett didn’t need to practice. I whispered his lines to him once under mybreath as we walked into the classroom.</p> 
<p>　　Ben was already in his seat behind mine, assembling his homework to hand in.</p> 
<p>　　Emmett and I both sat and did the same thing. The classroom was not quiet yet; themurmur of subdued conversation would continue until Mrs. Goff called for </p> 
<p>attention.</p> 
<p>　　She was in no hurry, appraising the quizzes from the last class.</p> 
<p>　　“So,” Emmett said, his voice louder than necessary—if he were really speakingonly to me. “Did you ask Angela Weber out yet?”</p> 
<p>　　The sound of papers rustling behind me came to an abrupt stop as Ben froze, hisattention suddenly riveted on our conversation.</p> 
<p>　　Angela? They’re talking about Angela?</p> 
<p>　　Good. I had his interest.</p> 
<p>　　“No,” I said, shaking my head slowly to appear regretful.</p> 
<p>　　“Why not?” Emmett improvised. “Are you chicken?”</p> 
<p>　　I grimaced at him. “No. I heard that she was interested in someone else.”</p> 
<p>　　Edward Cullen was going to ask Angela out? But… No. I don’t like that. I don’twant him near her. He’s…not right for her. Not…safe.</p> 
<p>　　I hadn’t anticipated the chivalry, the protective instinct. I’d been working forjealousy. But whatever worked.</p> 
<p>　　“You’re going to let that stop you?” Emmett asked scornfully, improvising again.</p> 
<p>　　“Not up for the competition?”</p> 
<p>　　&nbsp; I glared at him, but made used of what he gave me. “Look, I guess she reallylikes this Ben person. I’m not going to try to convince her otherwise. There are </p> 
<p>othergirls.”</p> 
<p>　　The reaction in the chair behind me was electric.</p> 
<p>　　“Who?” Emmett asked, back to the script.</p> 
<p>　　“My lab partner said it was some kid named Cheney. I’m not sure I know who heis.”</p> 
<p>　　I bit back my smile. Only the haughty Cullens could get away with pretendingnot to know every student at this tiny school.</p> 
<p>　　Ben’s head was whirling with shock. Me? Over Edward Cullen? But why wouldshe like me?</p> 
<p>　　“Edward,” Emmett muttered in a lower tone, rolling his eyes toward the boy.</p> 
<p>　　“He’s right behind you,” he mouthed, so obviously that the human could easily read thewords.</p> 
<p>　　“Oh,” I muttered back.</p> 
<p>　　I turned in my seat and glanced once at the boy behind me. For a second, theblack eyes behind the glasses were frightened, but then he stiffened and squared </p> 
<p>hisnarrow shoulders, affronted by my clearly disparaging evaluation. His chin shot out andan angry flush darkened his golden-brown skin.</p> 
<p>　　“Huh,” I said arrogantly as I turned back to Emmett.</p> 
<p>　　He thinks he’s better than me. But Angela doesn’t. I’ll show him…Perfect.</p> 
<p>　　“Didn’t you say she was taking Yorkie to the dance, though?” Emmett asked,snorting as he said the name of the boy that many scorned for his awkwardness.</p> 
<p>　　“That was a group decision apparently.” I wanted to be sure that Ben was clearon this. “Angela’s shy. If B—well, if a guy doesn’t have the nerve to ask her </p> 
<p>out, she’dnever ask him.”</p> 
<p>　　“You like shy girls,” Emmett said, back to improvisation. Quiet girls. Girlslike…hmm, I don’t know. Maybe Bella Swan?</p> 
<p>　　I grinned at him. “Exactly.” Then I returned to the performance. “Maybe Angelawill get tired of waiting. Maybe I’ll ask her to the prom.”</p> 
<p>　　&nbsp; No, you won’t, Ben thought, straightening up in his chair. So what if she’s somuch taller than me? If she doesn’t care, then neither do I. She’s the nicest, </p> 
<p>smartest,prettiest girl in this school… and she wants me.</p> 
<p>　　I liked this Ben. He seemed bright and well-meaning. Maybe even worthy of agirl like Angela.</p> 
<p>　　I gave Emmett a thumbs up under the desk as Mrs. Goff stood and greeted theclass.</p> 
<p>　　Okay, I’ll admit it—that was sort of fun, Emmett thought.</p> 
<p>　　I smiled to myself, pleased that I’d been able to shape one love story’s happyending. I was positive that Ben would follow through, and Angela would receive </p> 
<p>myanonymous gift. My debt was repaid.</p> 
<p>　　How silly humans were, to let a six inch height differential confound theirhappiness.</p> 
<p>　　My success put me in a good mood. I smiled again as I settled into my chair andprepared to be entertained. After all, as Bella had pointed out at lunch, I’d never </p> 
<p>seen herin action in her gym class before.</p> 
<p>　　Mike’s thoughts were the easiest to pinpoint in the babble of voices that swarmedthrough the gym. His mind had gotten far too familiar over the last few weeks. </p> 
<p>With asigh, I resigned myself to listening through him. At least I could be sure that he would bepaying attention to Bella.</p> 
<p>　　I was just in time to hear him offer to be her badminton partner; as he made thesuggestion, other partnerings ran through his mind. My smile faded, my teeth </p> 
<p>clenchedtogether, and I had to remind myself that murdering Mike Newton was not a permissibleoption.</p> 
<p>　　“Thanks, Mike—you don’t have to do this, you know.”</p> 
<p>　　“Don’t worry, I’ll keep out of your way.”</p> 
<p>　　They grinned at each other, and flashes of numerous accidents—always in someway connected to Bella—flashed through Mike’s head.</p> 
<p>　　Mike played alone at first, while Bella hesitated on the back half of the court,holding her racket gingerly, as if it was some kind of weapon. Then Coach Clapp </p> 
<p>ambledby and ordered Mike to let Bella play.</p> 
<p>　　&nbsp; Uh oh, Mike thought as Bella moved forward with a sigh, holding her racquet atan awkward angle.</p> 
<p>　　Jennifer Ford served the birdie directly toward Bella with a smug twist to herthoughts. Mike saw Bella lurch toward it, swinging the racket yards wide of her </p> 
<p>target,and he rushed in to try to save the volley.</p> 
<p>　　I watched the trajectory of Bella’s racquet with alarm. Sure enough, it hit the tautnet and sprung back at her, clipping her forehead before it spun out to strike </p> 
<p>Mike’s armwith a resounding thwack.</p> 
<p>　　Ow. Ow. Ungh. That’s going to leave a bruise.</p> 
<p>　　Bella was kneading her forehead. It was hard to stay in my seat where I belonged,knowing she was hurt. But what could I do, if I were there? And it didn’t seem to </p> 
<p>beserious… I hesitated, watching. If she intended to continue to try to play, I was going tohave to manufacture an excuse to pull her out of class.</p> 
<p>　　The coach laughed. “Sorry, Newton.” That girl’s the worst jinx I’ve ever seen.</p> 
<p>　　Shouldn’t inflict her on the others…He turned his back deliberately and moved to watch another game so that Bellacould return to her former spectator’s role.</p> 
<p>　　Ow, Mike thought again, massaging his arm. He turned to Bella. “Are youokay?”</p> 
<p>　　“Yeah, are you?” she asked sheepishly, blushing.</p> 
<p>　　“I think I’ll make it.” Don’t want to sound like a crybaby. But, man, that hurts!</p> 
<p>　　Mike swung his arm in a circle, wincing.</p> 
<p>　　“I’ll just stay back here,” Bella said, embarrassment and chagrin on her facerather than pain. Maybe Mike had got the worst of it. I certainly hoped that was the </p> 
<p>case.</p> 
<p>　　At least she wasn’t playing anymore. She held her racquet so carefully behind her back,her eyes wide with remorse… I had to disguise my laugh as coughing.</p> 
<p>　　What’s funny? Emmett wanted to know.</p> 
<p>　　“Tell you later,” I muttered.</p> 
<p>　　Bella didn’t venture into the game again. The coach ignored her and let Mikeplay alone.</p> 
<p>　　&nbsp; I breezed through the quiz at the end of the hour, and Mrs. Goff let me go early. Iwas listening intently to Mike as I walked across the campus. He’d decided to </p> 
<p>confrontBella about me.</p> 
<p>　　Jessica swears they’re dating. Why? Why did he have to pick her?</p> 
<p>　　He didn’t recognize the real phenomenon—that she’d picked me.</p> 
<p>　　“So.”</p> 
<p>　　“So what?” she wondered.</p> 
<p>　　“You and Cullen, huh?” You and the freak. I guess, if a rich guy is thatimportant to you...</p> 
<p>　　I gritted my teeth at his degrading assumption.</p> 
<p>　　“That’s none of your business, Mike.”</p> 
<p>　　Defensive. So it’s true. Crap. “I don’t like it.”</p> 
<p>　　“You don’t have to,” she snapped.</p> 
<p>　　Why can’t she see what a circus sideshow he is? Like they all are. The way hestares at her. It gives me chills to watch. “He looks at you like…like you’re </p> 
<p>something toeat.”</p> 
<p>　　I cringed, waiting for her response.</p> 
<p>　　Her face turned bright red, and her lips pressed together like she was holding herbreath. Then, suddenly, a giggle burst through her lips.</p> 
<p>　　Now she’s laughing at me. Great.</p> 
<p>　　Mike turned, thoughts sullen, and wandered off to change.</p> 
<p>　　I leaned against the gym wall and tried to compose myself.</p> 
<p>　　How could she have laughed at Mike’s accusation—so entirely on target that Ibegan to worry that Forks was becoming too aware… Why would she laugh at </p> 
<p>thesuggestion that I could kill her, when she knew that it was entirely true? Where was thehumor in that?</p> 
<p>　　What was wrong with her?</p> 
<p>　　Did she have morbid sense of humor? That didn’t fit with my idea of hercharacter, but how could I be sure? Or maybe my daydream of the giddy angel was truein the </p> 
<p>one respect, in that she had no sense of fear at all. Brave—that was one word forit. Others might say stupid, but I knew how bright she was. No matter what the reason, </p> 
<p>&nbsp;though, this lack of fear or twisted sense of humor wasn’t good for her. Was it thisstrange lack that put her in danger so constantly? Maybe she would always need </p> 
<p>mehere…Just like that, my mood was soaring.</p> 
<p>　　If I could just discipline myself, make myself safe, then perhaps it would be rightfor me to stay with her.</p> 
<p>　　When she walked through the gym doors, her shoulders were stiff and her lowerlip was between her teeth again—a sign of anxiety. But as soon as her eyes met </p> 
<p>mine,her rigid shoulders relaxed and a wide smile spread across her face. It was an oddlypeaceful expression. She walked right to my side without hesitation, only </p> 
<p>stopping whenshe was so close that her body heat crashed over me like a tidal wave.</p> 
<p>　　“Hi,” she whispered.</p> 
<p>　　The happiness I felt in this moment was, again, without precedent.</p> 
<p>　　“Hello,” I said, and then—because with my mood suddenly so light I couldn’tresist teasing her—I added, “How was gym?”</p> 
<p>　　Her smile wavered. “Fine.”</p> 
<p>　　She was a poor liar.</p> 
<p>　　“Really?” I asked, about to press the issue—I was still concerned about her head;was she in pain?—but then Mike Newton’s thoughts we so loud they broke </p> 
<p>myconcentration.</p> 
<p>　　I hate him. I wish he would die. I hope he drives that shiny car right off a cliff.</p> 
<p>　　Why couldn’t he just leave her alone? Stick to his own kind—to the freaks.</p> 
<p>　　“What?” Bella demanded.</p> 
<p>　　My eyes refocused on her face. She looked at Mike’s retreating back, and then atme again.</p> 
<p>　　“Newton’s getting on my nerves,” I admitted.</p> 
<p>　　Her mouth fell open, and her smile disappeared. She must have forgotten that I’dhad the power to watch through her calamitous last hour, or hoped that I hadn’t </p> 
<p>utilized it.</p> 
<p>　　“You weren’t listening again?”</p> 
<p>　　“How’s your head?”</p> 
<p>　　&nbsp; “You’re unbelievable!” she said through her teeth, and then she turned away fromme and stalked furiously toward the parking lot. Her skin flushed dark red—she </p> 
<p>wasembarrassed.</p> 
<p>　　I kept pace with her, hoping that her anger would pass soon. She was usuallyquick to forgive me.</p> 
<p>　　“You were the one who mentioned how I’d never seen you in Gym,” I explained.</p> 
<p>　　“It made me curious.”</p> 
<p>　　She didn’t answer; her eyebrows pulled together.</p> 
<p>　　She came to a sudden halt in the parking lot when she realized that the way to mycar was blocked by a crowd of male students.</p> 
<p>　　I wonder how fast they’ve gone in this thing…Look at the SMG shift paddles. I’ve never seen those outside of a magazine…Nice side grills…Sure wish I had sixty </p> 
<p>thousand dollars laying around…This was exactly why it was better for Rosalie to only use her car out of town.</p> 
<p>　　I wound through the throng of lustful boys to my car; after a second of hesitation,Bella followed suit.</p> 
<p>　　“Ostentatious,” I muttered as she climbed in.</p> 
<p>　　“What kind of car is that?” she wondered.</p> 
<p>　　“An M3.”</p> 
<p>　　She frowned. “I don’t speak Car and Driver.”</p> 
<p>　　“It’s a BMW.” I rolled my eyes and then focused on backing out without runninganyone down. I had to lock eyes with a few boys that didn’t seem willing to move </p> 
<p>out ofmy way. A half-second meeting my gaze seemed to be enough to convince them.</p> 
<p>　　“Are you still angry?” I asked her. Her frown had relaxed.</p> 
<p>　　“Definitely,” she answered curtly.</p> 
<p>　　I sighed. Maybe I shouldn’t have brought it up. Oh well. I could try to makeamends, I supposed. “Will you forgive me if I apologize?”</p> 
<p>　　She thought about that for a moment. “Maybe…if you mean it,” she decided.</p> 
<p>　　“And if you promise not to do it again.”</p> 
<p>　　&nbsp; I wasn’t going to lie to her, and there was no way I was agreeing to that. Perhapsif I offered her a different exchange.</p> 
<p>　　“How about if I mean it, and I agree to let you drive this Saturday?” I cringedinternally at the thought.</p> 
<p>　　The furrow popped into existence between her eyes as she considered the newbargain. “Deal,” she said after a moment of thought.</p> 
<p>　　Now for my apology… I’d never tried to dazzle Bella on purpose before, butnow seemed like a good time. I stared deep into her eyes as I drove away from theschool, </p> 
<p>wondering if I was doing it right. I used my most persuasive tone.</p> 
<p>　　“Then I’m very sorry I upset you.”</p> 
<p>　　Her heartbeat thudded louder than before, and the rhythm was abruptly staccato.</p> 
<p>　　Her eyes widened, looking a little stunned.</p> 
<p>　　I half-smiled. It seemed like I’d gotten it right. Of course, I was having a bit ofdifficulty looking away from her eyes, too. Equally dazzled. It was a good thing </p> 
<p>I hadthis road memorized.</p> 
<p>　　“And I’ll be on your doorstep bright and early Saturday morning,” I added,finishing the agreement.</p> 
<p>　　She blinked swiftly, shaking her head as if to clear it. “Um,” she said, “it doesn’thelp with the Charlie situation if an unexplained Volvo is left in the </p> 
<p>driveway.”</p> 
<p>　　Ah, how little she still knew me. “I wasn’t intending to bring a car.”</p> 
<p>　　“How—” she started to ask.</p> 
<p>　　I interrupted her. The answer would be hard to explain without a demonstration,and now was hardly the time. “Don’t worry about it. I’ll be there, no car.”</p> 
<p>　　She put her head on one side, and looked for a second like she was going to pressfor more, but then she seemed to change her mind.</p> 
<p>　　“Is it later yet?” she asked, reminding me of our unfinished conversation in thecafeteria today; she’d let go of one difficult question just to return another </p> 
<p>that was moreunappealing.</p> 
<p>　　“I suppose it is later,” I agreed unwillingly.</p> 
<p>　　&nbsp; I parked in front of her house, tensing as I tried to think of how toexplain…without making my monstrous nature too evident, without frightening heragain. Or was </p> 
<p>that wrong? To minimalize my darkness?</p> 
<p>　　She waited with the same politely interested mask she’d worn at lunch. If I’dbeen less anxious, her preposterous calm would have made me laugh.</p> 
<p>　　“And you still want to know why you can’t see me hunt?” I asked.</p> 
<p>　　“Well, mostly I was wondering about your reaction,” she said.</p> 
<p>　　“Did I frighten you?” I asked, positive that she would deny it.</p> 
<p>　　“No.”</p> 
<p>　　I tried not to smile, and failed. “I apologize for scaring you.” And then my smilevanished with the momentary humor. “It was just the very thought of you </p> 
<p>beingthere…while we hunted.”</p> 
<p>　　“That would be bad?”</p> 
<p>　　The mental picture was too much—Bella, so vulnerable in the empty darkness;myself, out of control… I tried to banish it from my head. “Extremely.”</p> 
<p>　　“Because…?”</p> 
<p>　　I took a deep breath, concentrating for one moment on the burning thirst. Feelingit, managing it, proving my dominion over it. It would never control me again—I </p> 
<p>willedthat to be true. I would be safe for her. I stared at the welcome clouds without seeingthem, wishing I could believe that my determination would make any </p> 
<p>difference if I werehunting when I crossed her scent.</p> 
<p>　　“When we hunt…we give ourselves over to our senses,” I told her, thinkingthrough each word before I spoke it. “Govern less with our minds. Especially our </p> 
<p>senseof smell. If you were anywhere near me when I lost control that way…”</p> 
<p>　　I shook my head in agony at the thought of what would—not what could, butwhat would—surely happen then.</p> 
<p>　　I listened to the spike in her heartbeat, and then turned, restless, to read her eyes.</p> 
<p>　　Bella’s face was composed, her eyes grave. Her mouth was pursed just slightly inwhat I guessed was concern. But concern for what? Her own safety? Or my anguish? </p> 
<p>Icontinued to stare at her, trying to translate her ambiguous expression into sure fact.</p> 
<p>　　&nbsp; She gazed back. Her eyes grew wider after a moment, and her pupils dilated,though the light had not changed.</p> 
<p>　　My breathing accelerated, and suddenly the quiet in the car seemed to behumming, just like in the darkened biology room this afternoon. The pulsing currentraced </p> 
<p>between us again, and my desire to touch her was, briefly, stronger even than thedemands of my thirst.</p> 
<p>　　The throbbing electricity made it feel like I had a pulse again. My body sang withit. Like I was human. More than anything in the world, I wanted to feel the heat </p> 
<p>of herlips against mine. For one second, I struggled desperately to find the strength, thecontrol, to able to put my mouth so close to her skin…She sucked in a ragged </p> 
<p>breath, and only then did I realize that when I had startedbreathing faster, she had stopped breathing altogether.</p> 
<p>　　I closed my eyes, trying to break the connection between us.</p> 
<p>　　No more mistakes.</p> 
<p>　　Bella’s existence was tied to a thousand delicately balanced chemical processes,all so easily disrupted. The rhythmic expansion of her lungs, the flow of oxygen, </p> 
<p>was lifeor death to her. The fluttering cadence of her fragile heart could be stopped by so manystupid accidents or illnesses or…by me.</p> 
<p>　　I did not believe that any member of my family would hesitate if he or she wereoffered a chance back—if he or she could trade immortality for mortality again. Any </p> 
<p>oneof us would stand in fire for it. Burn for as many days or centuries as were necessary.</p> 
<p>　　Most of our kind prized immortality above anything else. There were evenhumans who craved this, who searched in dark places for those who could give them </p> 
<p>theblackest of gifts…Not us. Not my family. We would trade anything to be human.</p> 
<p>　　But none of us had ever been as desperate for a way back as I was now.</p> 
<p>　　I stared at the microscopic pits and flaws in the windshield, like there was somesolution hidden in the glass. The electricity had not faded, and I had to </p> 
<p>concentrate tokeep my hands on the wheel.</p> 
<p>　　My right hand began to sting without pain again, from when I’d touched herbefore.</p> 
<p>　　&nbsp; “Bella, I think you should go inside now.”</p> 
<p>　　She obeyed at once, without comment, getting out of the car and shutting the doorbehind herself. Did she feel the potential for disaster as clearly as I did?</p> 
<p>　　Did it hurt her to leave, as it hurt me to let her go? The only solace was that Iwould see her soon. Sooner than she would see me. I smiled at that, then rolled </p> 
<p>thewindow down and leaned across to speak to her one more time—it was safer now, withthe heat of her body outside the car.</p> 
<p>　　She turned to see what I wanted, curious.</p> 
<p>　　Still curious, though she’d asked me so many questions today. My own curiositywas entirely unsatisfied; answering her questions today had only revealed my secrets</p> 
<p>—I’d gotten little from her but my own conjectures. That wasn’t fair.</p> 
<p>　　“Oh, Bella?”</p> 
<p>　　“Yes?”</p> 
<p>　　“Tomorrow it’s my turn.”</p> 
<p>　　Her forehead puckered. “Your turn to what?”</p> 
<p>　　“Ask the questions.” Tomorrow, when we were in a safer place, surrounded bywitnesses, I would get my own answers. I grinned at the thought, and then I turned </p> 
<p>awaybecause she made no move to leave. Even with her outside of the car, the echo of theelectricity zinged in the air. I wanted to get out, too, to walk her to her door </p> 
<p>as an excuseto stay beside her…No more mistakes. I hit the gas, and then sighed as she disappeared behind me. Itseemed like I was always running toward Bella or </p> 
<p>running away from her, never stayingin place. I would have to find some way to hold my ground if we were ever going tohave any peace.</p> 
<p>　　&nbsp; </p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 难题我们默默地走去上生物课。我极力将注意力集中到眼前这一刻上，集中到我身边这个女孩上，集中到这些实实在在的事情上，随便集中到什么事上都成，只要能把爱丽丝那些毫无意义</p> 
<p>的骗人的幻觉从我脑子里赶出去。</p> 
<p>　　我们经过安吉拉?韦伯，她一直待在人行道上，跟一个同她一起上三角课的男生讨论作业问题。</p> 
<p>　　我马马虎虎地扫过她的想法，本以为自己会更加失望，没想到它们竟流露出某种渴望，让我感到惊讶。</p> 
<p>　　啊，这么看来，是有这么一件东西是安吉拉想要的。不幸的是，那不是一件可以轻轻松松被当作礼物打包送出去的东西。</p> 
<p>　　听见安吉拉无望的思慕，我感到一种奇怪的宽慰。一种同病相怜的感觉从我心底流过，而安吉拉永远不会知道这一点，我，在那一瞬间，跟这个善良的人类女孩心意相通。</p> 
<p>　　原来并不是只有我才爱得如此悲惨，奇怪的是，这抚慰了我的心。心碎的爱情故事到处都是。</p> 
<p>　　紧接着下一秒，我又突然感到一阵愤慨不平。因为安吉拉的故事并不是非成为悲剧不可。她是人类，他也是人类，而在她看来似乎是难以克服的差异，其实是那么的可笑，唉，跟我的情况</p> 
<p>比起来，真是可笑极了。她的心碎毫无意义。她的悲伤有多浪费啊，既然并没有什么充分理由让她不能跟自己喜欢的人在一起。为什么她不能跟自己喜欢的人在一起呢？为什么这个故事不能有</p> 
<p>一个幸福的结局呢？</p> 
<p>　　我应该送她一份礼物……那就这样吧，我会给她她想要的。鉴于我要做的事跟人性有关，那 就应该不会太难。我筛查过她身边那个男孩的思想，就是她暗恋的对象，他好像也不是不情愿</p> 
<p>，他只是跟她一样被同样的问题难住了。感到无望，却又听天由命，她现在的情况就是这样。</p> 
<p>　　我要做的无非就是播下希望的种子……一个计划毫不费力地就在我脑子里成形了，对我来说，给这计划编写脚本不费吹灰之力。我需要爱美特的帮助——要他附和这个计划才是最困难的一</p> 
<p>环。跟吸血鬼的天性相比，人性要容易操控得多。</p> 
<p>　　让我高兴的是，我已经找到了解决办法，让我能把那份礼物送给安吉拉。这是一个很好的分散注意的方法，让我用不着老想着自己的难题。我自己那个难题也能这么容易被解决吗？</p> 
<p>　　当贝拉和我在我们的位置上就坐时，我的心情稍微有点好转了。也许我应该更乐观一点。也许会有别的解决办法，我只是暂时还没找到，就像安吉拉一样，那么明显的解决办法她却没能发</p> 
<p>现。两者不太一样……可为什么要把时间浪费在绝望上呢？我没有时间去浪费了。流逝在贝拉身上的时间，每一秒钟都意义非凡。</p> 
<p>　　瓦纳先生推了一台电视机和录像机进来。他打算跳过一章他不是十分感兴趣的课文——遗传病——用连放三天电影的方法。《伦佐伦的油》不是一部叫人愉快的片子，可也挡不住教室里的</p> 
<p>兴奋气氛。不用记笔记，也不用单元测验。一连三天的自由时间。人们都欢呼雀跃。</p> 
<p>　　不管是哪一个原因，都跟我没有关系。我没打算将注意力集中到除贝拉以外的任何事情上。</p> 
<p>　　今天我没有把椅子拉开去，远离她，好给自己呼吸的空间。相反，我坐得离她很近，就像正常人一样。比我们坐在车里时还要近，近到足以让我左边的身体被她皮肤散发出来的温热所淹没</p> 
<p>。</p> 
<p>　　这种经历完全是陌生的，可我情愿这么做也不愿隔着一张桌子坐在她对面。这已经超过了我所习惯的距离，可我很快就意识到这还不够。我还不满足。这么挨近她，只会让我想要靠得更近</p> 
<p>。我离得越近，那股吸引力就越强烈。</p> 
<p>　　我曾指责她是一块专门吸引危险的磁铁。此时此刻，我分明感觉到：这是一个不折不扣的事实。我就是一个危险人物，而且，随着我允许自己朝她一寸一寸地挨近，她的吸引力也在大幅度</p> 
<p>增强。</p> 
<p>　　然后瓦纳先生将灯关掉了。</p> 
<p>　　太奇怪了，这么一来居然会让一切变了个样儿，就我的视力而论，没有光线对我影响不大。</p> 
<p>　　我还是能像刚才那样看得一清二楚。教室里的所有动静都能被我尽收眼底。</p> 
<p>　　那为什么空气中会有一股电流让我全身为之一震，既然这片黑暗对我来说根本不算黑暗？是不是因为我知道只有我能看得清清楚楚，而其他人则看不见贝拉和我呢？就像我们正在独处一般</p> 
<p>，只有我们两个人，隐藏在漆黑一片的房间里，坐在一起，彼此挨得那么近……我的手在不经我允许的情况下就擅自向她那边伸了过去。只是去碰一下她的手，只是在这片黑暗中握住它。这么</p> 
<p>做会不会是一个可怕的错误？要是我的皮肤让她感到不安了，她只要把手移开就好了……我猛地抽回手，两臂交叉紧扣，抱在胸前，双手紧握成拳。别犯错。我承诺过自己不能犯错误的，哪怕</p> 
<p>是些看起来无足轻重的错误。如果我握住她的手，我只会想要得到更多——会想要再碰一碰她，会想要进一步靠近她。我能感觉得到。一股新的欲望正从我心底油然而生，企图压倒我的自控力</p> 
<p>。</p> 
<p>　　别犯错。</p> 
<p>　　贝拉交叉两臂，牢牢地抱在胸前，她的双手也握成了拳头，跟我一样。</p> 
<p>　　你在想什么？我很想这么低声问她，可房间里太静了，根本不容许我们低声交谈。</p> 
<p>　　电影开始了，给这片黑暗带来了一点点光线。贝拉抬头看了我一眼。她注意到了我身体僵硬——就像她一样——然后微笑了一下。她的嘴唇微微张开，她的眼里仿佛充满了热情的诱惑。</p> 
<p>　　 又或者，我只是看见我想看的。</p> 
<p>　　我也回以微笑；她低喘了口气，很快看向别的地方。</p> 
<p>　　那样更糟。我不知道她在想什么，可我突然确信我之前的想法是对的：她想要我碰她。她跟我一样感觉到了这种危险的渴望。</p> 
<p>　　在她的身体和我的之间，有一股电流通过。</p> 
<p>　　在整一个小时里，她都没有动，让自己僵硬地坐在那儿，显出一副克制的样子，我也一样。</p> 
<p>　　偶尔她会偷偷地看我一眼，而这时，那股嗡嗡的电流就会传遍全身，让我悚然一震。</p> 
<p>　　这一个小时结束了——结束得很慢，可还不够慢。这种体验是全新的，我能够像这样坐在她身边，坐上一整天，仅仅为了尽情品味一下这份感觉。</p> 
<p>　　时间一分一秒的过去，在此期间，我跟自己争论过无数次，我极力想证明自己碰她是有理的，理性与欲望争执不休。</p> 
<p>　　终于，瓦纳先生把灯又拧开了。</p> 
<p>　　在明亮的日光灯下，房间里的气氛又恢复正常。贝拉叹了口气，向前伸出胳膊，活动了一下手指。对她来说，长时间固定一个姿势肯定会觉得不舒服。这对我来说却不算什么——做到静止</p> 
<p>不动再自然不过了。</p> 
<p>　　她脸上松口气的表情让我轻声笑出来。“嗯，挺有意思的。”</p> 
<p>　　“唔。”她嘀咕了一声，对我话里的暗示心知肚明，可没作什么评论。这一刻，要能听见她现在的想法，我情愿付出一切。</p> 
<p>　　我叹了口气。再怎么期盼也无济于事。</p> 
<p>　　“我们走吧？”我问道，一边站了起来。</p> 
<p>　　她脸上露出苦相，摇摇晃晃地站起身，两手张开，好像生怕自己会摔倒。</p> 
<p>　　我可以伸手扶她一把。或者我可以把手放在她的胳膊肘底下——只是轻轻地——好让她站稳。</p> 
<p>　　这么做肯定不会是一个可怕的犯规……别犯错。</p> 
<p>　　在我们一起走去体育馆的路上，她很安静。她眉宇间的那道皱纹十分明显，她在沉思。我，也在沉思着……碰一下她的皮肤不会弄伤她的，我那自私的一方这么声称。</p> 
<p>　　要控制我手上的力道很容易。这真的不会太难，只要我能牢牢地控制住自己。我的触觉比人类的要更发达；我能弄歪成打叠起的高脚水晶酒杯而不会打破其中一只；我能轻抚一个肥皂泡而</p> 
<p>不会把它弄破，只要我牢牢地控制住……贝拉就好比一个肥皂泡——易碎而又短暂。转瞬即逝。</p> 
<p>　　我出现在她生命中的时间能有多长呢？我还能拥有多少时间呢？我还有机会像现在这次一样吗？如同这一刻，这一秒？她不会永远停留在我触手可及的地方……在体育馆门口，贝拉转身面</p> 
<p>对我，我脸上流露出来的表情让她的眼睛睁大了。她没有说话。</p> 
<p>　　我看着她眼中映射出来的自己的倒影，看见了我脸上强烈的纠结。我看见我的脸改变了，我那更好的一面输掉了这场争论。</p> 
<p>　　我的手在不知不觉中举起。轻轻地，就仿佛她是用最薄的玻璃做成的，就仿佛她是一个易碎的泡影，我的手指拂过她脸颊的温热肌肤。它在我的触摸下变得更热了，我能够感觉到她透明肌</p> 
<p>肤下血液的脉动正在加速运行。</p> 
<p>　　够了，我命令自己，尽管我的手渴望沿着她的脸颊轻抚下去。够了。</p> 
<p>　　要把自己的手扯回来真的很困难，为的是阻止自己比现在更进一步地去接近她。在这一刹那间，我脑子里闪过上千种不同的可能性——上千种去碰她的方式。用我的指尖描摹她唇瓣的形状</p> 
<p>。用我的手掌托起她的下巴。拈一绺她的秀发缠绕在我的指间。用我的双臂环住她的腰，让她紧紧贴住我的身躯。</p> 
<p>　　 够了。</p> 
<p>　　我强迫自己转身，离开她走了。我走路的时候身体直挺挺的——很不情愿。</p> 
<p>　　我走得飞快，几乎是逃也似的远离那份诱惑，把心留在了身后，一直留在她身上，注视着她。</p> 
<p>　　我捕捉到了麦克?牛顿的思想——它们最响亮——他看见贝拉神情恍惚地从他身边走过，两眼茫然，脸颊绯红；他怒目注视，突然我的名字连着一大串咒骂从他脑子里蹦出来；我不觉轻笑</p> 
<p>出声，作为回应。</p> 
<p>　　我的手正隐隐刺痛。我活动了一下手掌，然后把它捏成拳头，可还是感到有种针扎一般的刺痛。</p> 
<p>　　不，我没有弄伤她——可碰她依然是一个错误。</p> 
<p>　　就像一团火焰——就像从我喉间升起的干渴迅速传遍我的全身。</p> 
<p>　　若有下一次，当我离她这样近的时候，我能够阻止自己不再碰她吗？还有，如果我再碰她一次，我能让自己就此住手吗？</p> 
<p>　　别再犯更多错误了。就是这样。尽情享受这段回忆吧，爱德华，我冷酷地对自己说，还有，管住你的手。否则，或者我将不得不迫使自己离开……以某种方式。因为，如果我坚持继续犯错</p> 
<p>的话，我就不允许自己再待在她身边了。</p> 
<p>　　我深深地吸了口气，让自己能够定下心来。</p> 
<p>　　爱美特在上英语课的教学楼前面看见了我。</p> 
<p>　　“嗨，爱德华。”（他看起来好一点了。古里古怪的，可是好一点了。挺快活的。）“嘿，爱美。”我看起来快活吗？我猜，尽管我脑子里乱糟糟的，我是有那种感觉。</p> 
<p>　　（想办法管住你的嘴，小子。罗莎莉很想把你的舌头割下来哩。）我叹了口气。“我很抱歉让你来应付这件事。你会生我的气吗？”</p> 
<p>　　“没事儿。罗斯会消气的。反正这事儿早晚会发生。”（就像爱丽丝预见的那样……）我眼下还不想去考虑爱丽丝的幻觉。我直视前方，牙齿咬得紧紧的。</p> 
<p>　　我看向四周，想找点能分散一下我注意力的东西，结果一眼看见本?切尼走在我们前面，正走进西班牙语课室。啊——我送礼物给安吉拉的机会来了。</p> 
<p>　　我停下脚步，一把抓住爱美特的胳膊。“等一等。”</p> 
<p>　　（干嘛？）“我知道自己没这资格，可不管怎样，你能不能帮我一个忙呢？”</p> 
<p>　　“做什么？”他好奇地问。</p> 
<p>　　我说完我的计划后，他茫然地盯着我，他脑子里的想法跟他的脸一样茫然。</p> 
<p>　　“怎么样？”我催促道，“你肯不肯帮我这个忙嘛？”</p> 
<p>　　他过了一分钟才作出回答。“可这是为什么呀？”</p> 
<p>　　“来吧，爱美特。何乐而不为呢？”</p> 
<p>　　（你谁啊？你把我的兄弟怎么样啦？）“不是你老在那儿埋怨学校总是老样子一成不变吗？眼下这件事儿就有些不一般了，对吧？</p> 
<p>　　你可以把它看作是一个实验——一个关于人性的实验。”</p> 
<p>　　他又盯着我看了一会儿，然后屈服了。“好吧，是有点不一般，我想我可以帮你忙……噢，那好吧。”爱美特嗤之以鼻，然后耸耸肩。“我帮你。”</p> 
<p>　　我冲他咧嘴一笑，既然有他帮忙，我对这个计划就更热心了。罗莎莉是挺叫人心烦的，不过看在爱美特的份上，我会永远感激她的；没人比我这个兄弟更仗义了。</p> 
<p>　　爱美特用不着练习。在我们走进课室的时候，我就把他的台词低声告诉他了。</p> 
<p>　　本已经坐进自己的位置，就在我后面那排，他正整理着自己的作业打算交上去。爱美特和我坐在一起，也在整理作业。课室里还没有完全静下来；人们在小声交谈，直到高尔夫人开口叫上</p> 
<p>课为止。她这会儿还不急着上课，正批改着上节课的小测验。</p> 
<p>　　 “那么，”爱美特开口说道，他说话的声音根本没有必要这么响亮——如果他是真的只跟我一个人说话。“你已经邀请安吉拉?韦伯出去了吗？”</p> 
<p>　　我身后纸张翻动的沙沙声突然停住了，本一下子僵在那儿，他的注意力完全被我们的谈话牢牢吸住了。</p> 
<p>　　（安吉拉？他们在谈论安吉拉？）很好。我引起他的兴趣了。</p> 
<p>　　“没有。”我说道，一边慢慢地摇了摇头，好让自己表现出遗憾的表情。</p> 
<p>　　“为什么不呢？”爱美特临时加上一句台词。“你胆怯啦？”</p> 
<p>　　我冲他做了个鬼脸。“才不是。我听说她对别人有意思。”</p> 
<p>　　（爱德华?卡伦打算邀请安吉拉出去玩？可是……不。我不喜欢。我不想让他靠近她。他……不适合她。这不……安全。）我没有料到他那么有骑士风度，防御本能那么强。我本来以为他</p> 
<p>会心生嫉妒呢。可管它产生什么呢。</p> 
<p>　　“你就为这事儿放弃了？”爱美特轻蔑地问道，又临时拼凑了一句台词。“不打算跟别人竞争一下？”</p> 
<p>　　我怒视他，可还是回应他的台词给出回答。“听着，我猜她真的很喜欢这个叫本的人。我不打算用别的办法让她回心转意。反正还有别的女孩嘛。”</p> 
<p>　　坐在我身后那张椅子上的人的反应是大吃一惊。</p> 
<p>　　“谁？”爱美特问道，又回到我事先编好的脚本上来。</p> 
<p>　　“我的实验搭档说是一个姓切尼的家伙。我不肯定自己是不是认识他。”</p> 
<p>　　我稍微敛起了笑容。在这所巴掌大的学校里，只有目中无人的卡伦一家才能成功伪装成不认识这儿的每一个学生。</p> 
<p>　　本的头脑正因震惊而变得混乱。（我？赢了爱德华?卡伦？可为什么她会喜欢我？）“爱德华，”爱美特低语，嗓门压低一点了，他的眼睛往后面的男孩咕噜一转。“他就坐你后面呢。”</p> 
<p>他用口型示意，可这太明显了，谁都能轻易读懂。</p> 
<p>　　“噢。”我小声应了一句。</p> 
<p>　　我从椅子上转过身去，朝我身后的男孩瞥了一眼。在这一瞬间，镜片后那双黑眼睛被吓住了，可紧接着他身子一硬，挺了挺他那瘦弱的肩膀，我那明显瞧不起人的打量让他感觉受了侮辱。</p> 
<p>　　他的下巴一扬，因愤怒而涨红了脸，使得他那黄褐色的皮肤变得更暗了。</p> 
<p>　　“啊哈。”我傲慢地说道，转回身去。</p> 
<p>　　（他认为自己比我强。可安吉拉不这么想。我会让他见识见识的……）好极了。</p> 
<p>　　“不过，你说她会不会带那只笨笨狗去参加舞会呢？”爱美特问道，当他说到那个男孩时，对他的笨手笨脚嗤之以鼻。</p> 
<p>　　“很显然，这事儿得两厢情愿。”我想要确定这个本能清楚这一点。“安吉拉很害羞。要是本——呃，要是某个家伙没有勇气邀请她，她是永远不会开口问他的。”</p> 
<p>　　“你就是喜欢害羞的女孩。”爱美特说道，又来即兴创作了。（那种不起眼的女孩。就像……呃，我也不清楚。也许像贝拉?斯旺那样的？）我冲他露齿一笑。“你说对了。”然后我回到</p> 
<p>原来的角色。“也许安吉拉会厌倦继续等待。也许我可以邀请她参加舞会。”</p> 
<p>　　（不，你不可以，）本想道，在椅子上直起了身子。（那么，她个子比我高很多那又怎么样呢？</p> 
<p>　　如果她不在乎，那我也不在乎。她是这所学校里最善良、最聪明、最漂亮的女孩……还有，她喜欢我。）我喜欢这个本。他好像挺聪明的，心肠也好，也许他配得上像安吉拉的女孩。</p> 
<p>　　 当高尔夫人站起身向全班同学问好时，我在桌子底下给了爱美特一个大拇指。</p> 
<p>　　（好吧，我承认——这确实挺好玩的，）爱美特想道。</p> 
<p>　　我冲自己微笑，心里一阵高兴，因为我能够为一个爱情故事画上一个幸福的结局。我有信心这个本会坚持下去的，而安吉拉将收到我这份匿名礼物。我欠她的人情债还清了。</p> 
<p>　　唉，人类是多么可笑呀，竟会让六英寸的身高差距打败他们的幸福。</p> 
<p>　　我的成功给了我一个好心情。我又露出微笑，在椅子上安顿好，准备让自己好好乐一乐。毕竟，正如贝拉在午饭时指出的，我在此之前还从没见过她在体育课上的表现呢。</p> 
<p>　　在体育馆那群闹哄哄的声音里，麦克的想法是最容易找到的。在过去几个星期里，我对他的思想已经熟得不能再熟啦。我叹了口气，还是打算通过他的眼睛来看。至少我能肯定他会注意到</p> 
<p>贝拉。</p> 
<p>　　我刚好听见他主动提出要成为她的羽毛球搭档；当他这么提议时，脑子里闪过其他搭档的名字。我的笑容逐渐消失了，牙齿咬在一起，我不得不提醒自己谋杀麦克?牛顿是不被法律允许的</p> 
<p>。</p> 
<p>　　“谢谢你，麦克——你知道吗，你用不着这么做。”</p> 
<p>　　“别担心，我不会影响你的。”</p> 
<p>　　他们彼此相视一笑，麦克又嗅到了机遇的味道，它正闪闪发光——当然它们总是跟贝拉有关联。</p> 
<p>　　起初是麦克一个人打，而贝拉则站在球场的后面犹豫不决，一手紧握球拍，好像那是某种武器。然后克拉普教练溜达过来，命令麦克让贝拉打。</p> 
<p>　　（喔喔，）麦克心里惨叫，这时贝拉长叹一声走上前，紧握住球拍，摆出一个笨拙的姿势。</p> 
<p>　　珍妮弗?福特满心窃喜，一个球径直朝贝拉飞过去。麦克看见贝拉蹒跚地朝球扑过去，手里挥动着球拍，可显然毫无准头，于是他一个箭步冲上前，企图救回这一球。</p> 
<p>　　我注意到贝拉手忙脚乱将那一拍挥出去的轨迹。果然，它打到网上去了，并且朝她反弹回去，砰地一声结结实实地打中了麦克的手臂，随后猛地撞上她的额头。</p> 
<p>　　（喔。喔。天。肯定会留下淤痕。）贝拉揉着她的额头。我在位子上快坐不住了，她受了伤呀。可就算我在那儿，又能做什么呢？</p> 
<p>　　而且好像伤得不重……我犹豫着，还在看着。要是她还打算继续打下去，我就只好捏造一个借口把她从这节课上拉走了。</p> 
<p>　　教练笑了起来。“抱歉，牛顿。”（这女孩还真是个丧门星，真不该硬叫别人跟她组成一组……）他故意转身背对她，走开去看别的小组比赛，好让贝拉回到她之前扮演的旁观者角色。</p> 
<p>　　（喔，）麦克心里又在惨叫，一边揉着他的胳膊。他转向贝拉。“你还好吧？”</p> 
<p>　　“还好，你怎么样？”她羞怯地问道，脸都红了。</p> 
<p>　　“我想我还能应付。”（别说得像个爱哭鬼一样。可是，妈呀，太疼了！）麦克甩了甩胳膊，疼得缩开了。</p> 
<p>　　“我还是待在后面好了，”贝拉说道，她脸上的表情倒不怎么痛苦，反而充满尴尬和懊恼。也许麦克伤得比她重。我当然希望是这样啦。至少她用不着再玩了。她小心翼翼地把球拍背在身</p> 
<p>后，眼睛里满是懊悔……我不得不用咳嗽来掩饰笑声。</p> 
<p>　　 （有什么好玩儿的？）爱美特想知道。</p> 
<p>　　“稍后再告诉你。”我低声道。</p> 
<p>　　贝拉没有再冒险加入比赛。教练彻底无视她，让麦克一个人打。</p> 
<p>　　在那个小时的最后时段，我漫不经心地做完了小测验，于是高尔夫人让我提前下课。我一边穿过校园，一边专心地去听麦克。他决定向贝拉当面问清关于我的事。</p> 
<p>　　（杰西卡断言他们在约会。为什么？干嘛他偏要看中她？）他没有认清这一事实——是她看中我。</p> 
<p>　　“那么。”</p> 
<p>　　“那么什么？”她疑惑地问道。</p> 
<p>　　“你和卡伦，哈？”（你和那个怪胎。我猜，如果你是看中他有钱……）他这种低级的臆断让我把牙齿咬得格格响。</p> 
<p>　　“这不关你的事，麦克。”</p> 
<p>　　（瞧她一脸戒备。看来这事儿是真的了。狗屁。）“我不喜欢。”</p> 
<p>　　“用不着你喜欢。”她厉声道。</p> 
<p>　　（她怎么就没看出来他像个马戏团的小丑？他们全家都是那副德性。他盯着她看时的样子。</p> 
<p>　　让我看了直打哆嗦。）“他看你时的样子……就像把你当成点心一样。”</p> 
<p>　　我畏缩了，等着她回应。</p> 
<p>　　她的脸蛋涨得通红，她的嘴唇紧抿，就好像她在憋住气一样。接着，突然，她唇瓣挤出几声冷笑。</p> 
<p>　　（这会儿她正笑话我呢。好极了。）麦克转过身去，心里闷闷不乐的，打算走开找点别的事干。</p> 
<p>　　我靠在体育馆的墙上，极力让自己平静下来。</p> 
<p>　　她怎么能取笑麦克的指控呢——他的指责一语中的，让我开始担心福克斯人是不是都意识到什么了……她怎么能对我会杀死她这一指控还笑得出来，当她知道这是确凿的事实？这事儿有那</p> 
<p>么幽默吗？</p> 
<p>　　她脑子究竟有什么毛病啊？</p> 
<p>　　她是不是有某种病态的幽默感呀？这不符合我所了解的她的性格，可我怎么能确定呢？又或许，我妄想的那个轻率的天使确实在某个方面存在着，因为她根本没有恐惧感。勇敢——这是另</p> 
<p>一种说法。别的人可能会称之为愚蠢，可我知道她有多聪明。然而，不管是什么理由，这种恐惧感的欠缺或者是反常的幽默感对她来说都不是一件好事。会不会就是这种欠缺经常给她带来危险</p> 
<p>呢？也许她会一直需要我留在这儿……我的情绪冷不丁变得高昂起来。</p> 
<p>　　如果我能管好自己，确保我是安全的，那么或许我留在她身边就成了一件好事。</p> 
<p>　　当她从体育馆门口走出来时，她的肩膀僵硬，又用牙齿咬住下唇——一个焦虑的标记。可当她的眼睛一看见我，她那僵硬的肩膀一下子就放松下来，脸上绽开了灿烂的笑容。奇怪的是，她</p> 
<p>的表情很平和。她毫不犹豫地朝我这边走过来，在离我很近的地方停下，她挨得那么近，以致从她身上散发的体热犹如波浪一般朝我席卷过来。</p> 
<p>　　 “嗨。”她低声道。</p> 
<p>　　这一刻我再次感受到前所未有的快乐。</p> 
<p>　　“你好，”我说道，接着——因为我的心情突然变得太轻松了，让我忍不住要去取笑她——我加上一句。“体育课上得怎么样？”</p> 
<p>　　她的笑容有些勉强。“挺好。”</p> 
<p>　　她真是个蹩脚的撒谎者。</p> 
<p>　　“真的吗？”我问道，正打算逼问出实情——我还是不放心她的头，她现在还疼吗？——可紧接着麦克?牛顿脑子里刺耳的声音打断了我的注意力，他正在想我们的事。</p> 
<p>　　（我恨他。我巴不得他死掉。我恨不得他开着那辆闪亮亮的汽车从悬崖摔下去。为什么他不能离她远点？就跟他的同类待在一块儿好了——跟那些怪胎。）“怎么了？”贝拉询问。</p> 
<p>　　我的眼睛回到她脸上。她看着麦克渐行渐远的背影，然后又回到我身上。</p> 
<p>　　“牛顿让我感到有点不安。”我承认道。</p> 
<p>　　她的嘴巴张开了，然后脸上的微笑消失了。“你不会又在偷听吧？”</p> 
<p>　　“你的头没事吧？”</p> 
<p>　　“你真是让人难以置信！”她从牙缝里挤出这句话，然后转身离开我，迈开大步气冲冲地走向停车场。她脸上通红通红的——她窘极了。</p> 
<p>　　我合着她的脚步跟上去，一心盼望她的怒火能赶快过去。她通常很快就会原谅我的。</p> 
<p>　　“是你说我从没见过你在体育馆时的样子的，”我解释道，“你的话让我很好奇。”</p> 
<p>　　她没有回话；两道眉毛揪在一起。</p> 
<p>　　到了停车场，她突然停下脚步，她看见我车前面那条路被一大群男生堵住了。</p> 
<p>　　（我想知道有了这玩意儿它到底能开多快……看看这个SMG 拨片换挡键。我还从没在杂志以外的地方见过呢。</p> 
<p>　　车身酷毙了。</p> 
<p>　　真希望我也能有6 万块钱来装扮自己的车……）这就是为什么罗莎莉最好在镇外才开她这辆车。</p> 
<p>　　我拨开这群垂涎欲滴的男生走向我的车；贝拉迟疑了一秒钟，也跟着我做。</p> 
<p>　　“太招摇了。”当她坐进来时，我嘀咕了一句。</p> 
<p>　　“那是辆什么车？”她询问。</p> 
<p>　　“一辆M3。”</p> 
<p>　　她皱了皱眉。“我不懂《名车志》上的术语。”</p> 
<p>　　“是一辆宝马。”我转了转眼睛，然后小心翼翼地在不压倒人的情况下把车子倒出来。我不得不把目光锁定在几个男生身上，他们似乎很不情愿给我让路。但过不了半秒钟我的目光就让他</p> 
<p>们乖乖听话了。</p> 
<p>　　“你还在生气？”我问她道。她的眉头还在紧锁着。</p> 
<p>　　“当然。”她简洁的回答。</p> 
<p>　　我叹了口气。也许我是不该揭她疮疤的。噢，那好吧。我猜我能想出补救办法的。“要是我道歉的话，你会原谅我吗？”</p> 
<p>　　她想了一会儿。“也许吧……如果你是真心的话，”她打定主意，“不过你要保证以后再也不这样了。”</p> 
<p>　　我不打算对她撒谎，可要我照她说的去做，我可办不到。也许我能给她提供另外一个交换条件。</p> 
<p>　　“要是我是真心的，而且还答应周六让你开车呢？”一想到这，我就打了个哆嗦。</p> 
<p>　　她皱起眉头，考虑着我这个新提议。“成交。”她想了一会儿后说道 .</p>
