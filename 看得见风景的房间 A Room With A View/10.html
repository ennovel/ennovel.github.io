Her father, a prosperous local solicitor, had built Windy Corner, as a speculation at the time the district was opening up, and, falling in love with his own creation, had ended by living there himself. Soon after his marriage the social atmosphere began to alter. Other houses were built on the brow of that steep southern slope and others, again, among the pine-trees behind, and northward on the chalk barrier of the downs. Most of these houses were larger than Windy Corner, and were filled by people who came, not from the district, but from London, and who mistook the Honeychurches for the remnants of an indigenous aristocracy. He was inclined to be frightened, but his wife accepted the situation without either pride or humility. "I cannot think what people are doing," she would say, "but it is extremely fortunate for the children." She called everywhere; her calls were returned with enthusiasm, and by the time people found out that she was not exactly of their milieu, they liked her, and it did not seem to matter. When Mr. Honeychurch died, he had the satisfaction--which few honest solicitors despise--of leaving his family rooted in the best society obtainable.</p> 
<p>The best obtainable. Certainly many of the immigrants were rather dull, and Lucy realized this more vividly since her return from Italy. Hitherto she had accepted their ideals without questioning --their kindly affluence, their inexplosive religion, their dislike of paper-bags, orange-peel, and broken bottles. A Radical out and out, she learnt to speak with horror of Suburbia. Life, so far as she troubled to conceive it, was a circle of rich, pleasant people, with identical interests and identical foes. In this circle, one thought, married, and died. Outside it were poverty and vulgarity for ever trying to enter, just as the London fog tries to enter the pine-woods pouring through the gaps in the northern hills. But, in Italy, where any one who chooses may warm himself in equality, as in the sun, this conception of life vanished. Her senses expanded; she felt that there was no one whom she might not get to like, that social barriers were irremovable, doubtless, but not particularly high. You jump over them just as you jump into a peasant's olive-yard in the Apennines, and he is glad to see you. She returned with new eyes.</p> 
<p>So did Cecil; but Italy had quickened Cecil, not to tolerance, but to irritation. He saw that the local society was narrow, but, instead of saying, "Does that very much matter?" he rebelled, and tried to substitute for it the society he called broad. He did not realize that Lucy had consecrated her environment by the thousand little civilities that create a tenderness in time, and that though her eyes saw its defects, her heart refused to despise it entirely. Nor did he realize a more important point-- that if she was too great for this society, she was too great for all society, and had reached the stage where personal intercourse would alone satisfy her. A rebel she was, but not of the kind he understood--a rebel who desired, not a wider dwelling-room, but equality beside the man she loved. For Italy was offering her the most priceless of all possessions--her own soul.</p> 
<p>Playing bumble-puppy with Minnie Beebe, niece to the rector, and aged thirteen--an ancient and most honourable game, which consists in striking tennis-balls high into the air, so that they fall over the net and immoderately bounce; some hit Mrs. Honeychurch; others are lost. The sentence is confused, but the better illustrates Lucy's state of mind, for she was trying to talk to Mr. Beebe at the same time.</p> 
<p>"Oh, it has been such a nuisance--first he, then they--no one knowing what they wanted, and every one so tiresome."</p> 
<p>"But they really are coming now," said Mr. Beebe. "I wrote to Miss Teresa a few days ago--she was wondering how often the butcher called, and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably. They are coming. I heard from them this morning.</p> 
<p>"I shall hate those Miss Alans!" Mrs. Honeychurch cried. "Just because they're old and silly one's expected to say 'How sweet!' I hate their 'if'-ing and 'but'-ing and 'and'-ing. And poor Lucy --serve her right--worn to a shadow."</p> 
<p>Mr. Beebe watched the shadow springing and shouting over the tennis-court. Cecil was absent--one did not play bumble-puppy when he was there.</p> 
<p>"Well, if they are coming-- No, Minnie, not Saturn." Saturn was a tennis-ball whose skin was partially unsewn. When in motion his orb was encircled by a ring. "If they are coming, Sir Harry will let them move in before the twenty-ninth, and he will cross out the clause about whitewashing the ceilings, because it made them nervous, and put in the fair wear and tear one.--That doesn't count. I told you not Saturn."</p> 
<p>"Saturn's all right for bumble-puppy," cried Freddy, joining them. "Minnie, don't you listen to her."</p> 
<p>"Saturn doesn't bounce."</p> 
<p>"Saturn bounces enough."</p> 
<p>"No, he doesn't."</p> 
<p>"Well; he bounces better than the Beautiful White Devil."</p> 
<p>"Hush, dear," said Mrs. Honeychurch.</p> 
<p>"But look at Lucy--complaining of Saturn, and all the time's got the Beautiful White Devil in her hand, ready to plug it in. That's right, Minnie, go for her--get her over the shins with the racquet--get her over the shins!"</p> 
<p>Lucy fell, the Beautiful White Devil rolled from her hand.</p> 
<p>Mr. Beebe picked it up, and said: "The name of this ball is Vittoria Corombona, please." But his correction passed unheeded.</p> 
<p>Freddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls to fury, and in half a minute he had transformed Minnie from a well-mannered child into a howling wilderness. Up in the house Cecil heard them, and, though he was full of entertaining news, he did not come down to impart it, in case he got hurt. He was not a coward and bore necessary pain as well as any man. But he hated the physical violence of the young. How right it was! Sure enough it ended in a cry.</p> 
<p>"I wish the Miss Alans could see this," observed Mr. Beebe, just as Lucy, who was nursing the injured Minnie, was in turn lifted off her feet by her brother.</p> 
<p>"Who are the Miss Alans?" Freddy panted.</p> 
<p>"They have taken Cissie Villa."</p> 
<p>"That wasn't the name--"</p> 
<p>Here his foot slipped, and they all fell most agreeably on to the grass. An interval elapses.</p> 
<p>"Wasn't what name?" asked Lucy, with her brother's head in her lap.</p> 
<p>"Alan wasn't the name of the people Sir Harry's let to."</p> 
<p>"Nonsense, Freddy! You know nothing about it."</p> 
<p>"Nonsense yourself! I've this minute seen him. He said to me: 'Ahem! Honeychurch,'"--Freddy was an indifferent mimic--"'ahem! ahem! I have at last procured really dee-sire-rebel tenants.' I said, 'ooray, old boy!' and slapped him on the back."</p> 
<p>"Exactly. The Miss Alans?"</p> 
<p>"Rather not. More like Anderson."</p> 
<p>"Oh, good gracious, there isn't going to be another muddle!" Mrs. Honeychurch exclaimed. "Do you notice, Lucy, I'm always right? I said don't interfere with Cissie Villa. I'm always right. I'm quite uneasy at being always right so often."</p> 
<p>"It's only another muddle of Freddy's. Freddy doesn't even know the name of the people he pretends have taken it instead."</p> 
<p>"Yes, I do. I've got it. Emerson."</p> 
<p>"What name?"</p> 
<p>"Emerson. I'll bet you anything you like."</p> 
<p>"What a weathercock Sir Harry is," said Lucy quietly. "I wish I had never bothered over it at all."</p> 
<p>Then she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky. Mr. Beebe, whose opinion of her rose daily, whispered to his niece that THAT was the proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted Mrs. Honeychurch from the contemplation of her own abilities.</p> 
<p>"Emerson, Freddy? Do you know what Emersons they are?"</p> 
<p>"I don't know whether they're any Emersons," retorted Freddy, who was democratic. Like his sister and like most young people, he was naturally attracted by the idea of equality, and the undeniable fact that there are different kinds of Emersons annoyed him beyond measure.</p> 
<p>"I trust they are the right sort of person. All right, Lucy"--she was sitting up again--"I see you looking down your nose and thinking your mother's a snob. But there is a right sort and a wrong sort, and it's affectation to pretend there isn't."</p> 
<p>"Emerson's a common enough name," Lucy remarked.</p> 
<p>She was gazing sideways. Seated on a promontory herself, she could see the pine-clad promontories descending one beyond another into the Weald. The further one descended the garden, the more glorious was this lateral view.</p> 
<p>"I was merely going to remark, Freddy, that I trusted they were no relations of Emerson the philosopher, a most trying man. Pray, does that satisfy you?"</p> 
<p>"Oh, yes," he grumbled. "And you will be satisfied, too, for they're friends of Cecil; so--elaborate irony--"you and the other country families will be able to call in perfect safety."</p> 
<p>"CECIL?" exclaimed Lucy.</p> 
<p>"Don't be rude, dear," said his mother placidly. "Lucy, don't screech. It's a new bad habit you're getting into."</p> 
<p>"But has Cecil--"</p> 
<p>"Friends of Cecil's," he repeated, "'and so really dee-sire- rebel. Ahem! Honeychurch, I have just telegraphed to them.'"</p> 
<p>She got up from the grass.</p> 
<p>It was hard on Lucy. Mr. Beebe sympathized with her very much. While she believed that her snub about the Miss Alans came from Sir Harry Otway, she had borne it like a good girl. She might well "screech" when she heard that it came partly from her lover. Mr. Vyse was a tease--something worse than a tease: he took a malicious pleasure in thwarting people. The clergyman, knowing this, looked at Miss Honeychurch with more than his usual kindness.</p> 
<p>When she exclaimed, "But Cecil's Emersons--they can't possibly be the same ones--there is that--" he did not consider that the exclamation was strange, but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation while she recovered her composure. He diverted it as follows:</p> 
<p>"The Emersons who were at Florence, do you mean? No, I don't suppose it will prove to be them. It is probably a long cry from them to friends of Mr. Vyse's. Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, the oddest people! The queerest people! For our part we liked them, didn't we?" He appealed to Lucy. "There was a great scene over some violets. They picked violets and filled all the vases in the room of these very Miss Alans who have failed to come to Cissie Villa. Poor little ladies! So shocked and so pleased. It used to be one of Miss Catharine's great stories. 'My dear sister loves flowers,' it began. They found the whole room a mass of blue --vases and jugs--and the story ends with 'So ungentlemanly and yet so beautiful.' It is all very difficult. Yes, I always connect those Florentine Emersons with violets."</p> 
<p>"Fiasco's done you this time," remarked Freddy, not seeing that his sister's face was very red. She could not recover herself. Mr. Beebe saw it, and continued to divert the conversation.</p> 
<p>"These particular Emersons consisted of a father and a son--the son a goodly, if not a good young man; not a fool, I fancy, but very immature--pessimism, et cetera. Our special joy was the father--such a sentimental darling, and people declared he had murdered his wife."</p> 
<p>In his normal state Mr. Beebe would never have repeated such gossip, but he was trying to shelter Lucy in her little trouble. He repeated any rubbish that came into his head.</p> 
<p>"Murdered his wife?" said Mrs. Honeychurch. "Lucy, don't desert us--go on playing bumble-puppy. Really, the Pension Bertolini must have been the oddest place. That's the second murderer I've heard of as being there. Whatever was Charlotte doing to stop? By-the-by, we really must ask Charlotte here some time."</p> 
<p>Mr. Beebe could recall no second murderer. He suggested that his hostess was mistaken. At the hint of opposition she warmed. She was perfectly sure that there had been a second tourist of whom the same story had been told. The name escaped her. What was the name? Oh, what was the name? She clasped her knees for the name. Something in Thackeray. She struck her matronly forehead.</p> 
<p>Lucy asked her brother whether Cecil was in.</p> 
<p>"Oh, don't go!" he cried, and tried to catch her by the ankles.</p> 
<p>"I must go," she said gravely. "Don't be silly. You always overdo it when you play."</p> 
<p>As she left them her mother's shout of "Harris!" shivered the tranquil air, and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it right. Such a senseless lie, too, yet it shattered her nerves and made her connect these Emersons, friends of Cecil's, with a pair of nondescript tourists. Hitherto truth had come to her naturally. She saw that for the future she must be more vigilant, and be--absolutely truthful? Well, at all events, she must not tell lies. She hurried up the garden, still flushed with shame. A word from Cecil would soothe her, she was sure.</p> 
<p>"Cecil!"</p> 
<p>"Hullo!" he called, and leant out of the smoking-room window. He seemed in high spirits. "I was hoping you'd come. I heard you all bear-gardening, but there's better fun up here. I, even I, have won a great victory for the Comic Muse. George Meredith's right-- the cause of Comedy and the cause of Truth are really the same; and I, even I, have found tenants for the distressful Cissie Villa. Don't be angry! Don't be angry! You'll forgive me when you hear it all."</p> 
<p>He looked very attractive when his face was bright, and he dispelled her ridiculous forebodings at once.</p> 
<p>"I have heard," she said. "Freddy has told us. Naughty Cecil! I suppose I must forgive you. Just think of all the trouble I took for nothing! Certainly the Miss Alans are a little tiresome, and I'd rather have nice friends of yours. But you oughtn't to tease one so."</p> 
<p>"Friends of mine?" he laughed. "But, Lucy, the whole joke is to come! Come here." But she remained standing where she was. "Do you know where I met these desirable tenants? In the National Gallery, when I was up to see my mother last week."</p> 
<p>"What an odd place to meet people!" she said nervously. "I don't quite understand."</p> 
<p>"In the Umbrian Room. Absolute strangers. They were admiring Luca Signorelli--of course, quite stupidly. However, we got talking, and they refreshed me not--a little. They had been to Italy."</p> 
<p>"But, Cecil--" proceeded hilariously.</p> 
<p>"In the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country cottage--the father to live there, the son to run down for week-ends. I thought, 'What a chance of scoring off Sir Harry!' and I took their address and a London reference, found they weren't actual blackguards--it was great sport--and wrote to him, making out--"</p> 
<p>"Cecil! No, it's not fair. I've probably met them before--"</p> 
<p>He bore her down.</p> 
<p>"Perfectly fair. Anything is fair that punishes a snob. That old man will do the neighbourhood a world of good. Sir Harry is too disgusting with his 'decayed gentlewomen.' I meant to read him a lesson some time. No, Lucy, the classes ought to mix, and before long you'll agree with me. There ought to be intermarriage--all sorts of things. I believe in democracy--"</p> 
<p>"No, you don't," she snapped. "You don't know what the word means."</p> 
<p>He stared at her, and felt again that she had failed to be Leonardesque. "No, you don't!"</p> 
<p>Her face was inartistic--that of a peevish virago.</p> 
<p>"It isn't fair, Cecil. I blame you--I blame you very much indeed. You had no business to undo my work about the Miss Alans, and make me look ridiculous. You call it scoring off Sir Harry, but do you realize that it is all at my expense? I consider it most disloyal of you."</p> 
<p>She left him.</p> 
<p>"Temper!" he thought, raising his eyebrows.</p> 
<p>No, it was worse than temper--snobbishness. As long as Lucy thought that his own smart friends were supplanting the Miss Alans, she had not minded. He perceived that these new tenants might be of value educationally. He would tolerate the father and draw out the son, who was silent. In the interests of the Comic Muse and of Truth, he would bring them to Windy Corner.</p> 
<p>塞西尔打算把露西拯救出来的那个社交圈子也许并不十分美妙，然而它比露西祖先赋予她生活权利的那个社交圈子美妙得多。她的父亲是当地一位初级律师，业务相当发达，在这一地区的开发时期建造了风角，原本作为一项投机活动，但是却迷上了自己的创作，最后自己就住到那里去了。他结婚后不久，这社区的氛围开始变化。在南面陡峭的山坡顶上造起了其他的房屋，后面的松林里以及北边丘陵地的白垩石上，也都造起了房子。大多数房屋都比风角大，住的人家多半不是本地人，而是来自伦敦，他们把霍尼彻奇一家错误地看作这一地区贵族世家的残存后裔。露西的父亲感到惶恐，可是他的妻子却坦然处之，不亢不卑。她会这样说，“我想象不出人们在干什么，不过对我们的孩子们说来，这可是莫大的幸运。”她拜访了所有的人家；人们也热情地进行回访，等到他们发现她并不完全属于他们的那个“环境”时，他们已经喜欢上她了，因此看来关系不大。霍尼彻奇先生临死前，满意地发现他们一家已扎根在可能获得的最佳的社交圈子里了，而对这种满足，诚实的律师中很少有人会加以鄙视。</p> 
<p>这里是可能获得的最佳的社交圈子。当然很多迁居此地的人都很乏味，而露西从意大利回来后更加深刻地体会到了这一点。迄今为止，她一直毫不怀疑地接受了他们的种种理想——他们友好和富有，他们的宗教观念并不激烈，他们不喜欢纸袋、橘皮及碎瓶子。露西可是个十足的激进分子，学会了在讲到大城市的郊区生活时总带着厌恶的情绪。她努力设想的生活是一群讨人喜欢的有钱人组成的一个圈子，他们有着相同的兴趣和相同的敌人。人就在这个圈子里思想、结婚和死亡。这个圈子的外面就是贫困与庸俗，它们无孔不入，就像伦敦的大雾试图渗入松林，通过山口涌人北面的山岭。不过当她在意大利时，这种生活概念消失了，在那里，一个人只要愿意，就可以得到平等的温暖，就像人人能享受日光一样。她的各种感觉扩大了；她感到不可能不喜欢上每一个人。而社会隔阂是毫无疑问不可能排除的，但是这隔阂并不一定特别深。你越过这些隔阂，就像你跳人亚平宁山区一家农民的橄榄园，受到他的欢迎一样。她带着新眼光回来了。</p> 
<p>塞西尔也是带着新眼光回来的；然而意大利激发了塞西尔，并没有促使他变得宽容，反而促使他变得恼怒了。他认为当地的社交圈子太狭隘了，可是并没有说“难道这有天大的关系吗？”而是产生了反感，企图用一个他称之为宽广的社交圈子取而代之。他没有认识到千百种点点滴滴的友好行为已逐渐在露西心里产生了一股温情，使她把周围的环境看作一片圣洁的土地，而她的眼睛虽然看到了它有缺点，但是她的心却不愿完全鄙视它。塞西尔也没有认识到更重要的一点——如果说露西太好了，不适合于那个社交圈子，那么应该说她好得不适合所有的社交圈子，她已到达只有个人交流才能使她满足的阶段。她是个叛逆者，但不是他所理解的那种叛逆者——是一个希望获得与她所爱的人同样的平等地位、而不是追求更大居室的叛逆者。因为意大利给了她人在世界上所能占有的最宝贵的东西——那就是她自己的心灵。</p> 
<p>露西正在和教区长的十三岁侄女明妮·毕比玩一种击球游戏，这是一种古老、高雅的游戏，那是将网球高高地击人空中，让球掉在网的另一边，弹跳得很高；有一些球打中了霍尼彻奇太太；有一些失落了。这末一句话意义不明确，但却更好地说明露西的心态，因为她正试图同时和毕比先生交谈。</p> 
<p>“唉，这可真是桩讨厌事——起先是他，后来是她们——没有人知道她们想要什么，而所有的人又都那么讨厌。”</p> 
<p>“可是她们真的要来啊，”毕比先生说。“前几天我写信给特莉莎小姐——她很想知道肉店老板隔多少时候来一次，我回答说一个月来一次，这一定使她很满意。她们就要来了。我今天早晨收到了她们的信。”</p> 
<p>“我将会讨厌这两位艾伦小姐！”霍尼彻奇太太嚷道。“就因为她们老糊涂了，人们就得说，‘看，多可爱呀！’我讨厌挂在她们嘴边的那些‘假使’啊、‘不过’啊和‘还有’啊等等。这可怜的露西，她瘦得不成样子，不过也是活该。”</p> 
<p>毕比先生注视着那个瘦得不成样子的人影在网球场上跳来跳去，大喊大叫。塞西尔不在——他在场时大家就不玩击球游戏了。</p> 
<p>“哦，如果她们要来——不，明妮，不要土星。”土星是一只网球的名字，它的外层已有部分脱线了。在转动时，球面四周出现一道环。“如果她们要来，哈里爵士会让她们在二十九日前搬进去的，他还会把那个粉刷天花板的条款删掉，因为这会使她们紧张，并且加进合理损耗的条款。——那一下不算。我讲过不要土星嘛。”</p> 
<p>“玩击球游戏，土星还是可以的，”弗雷迪大声嚷道，他过来参加她们一起玩。“明妮，别听她的。”</p> 
<p>“土星弹不起来。”</p> 
<p>“土星弹得还是可以的。”</p> 
<p>“不，它弹不起来。”</p> 
<p>“得，它弹得可比俊白魔①（①指维托利亚·科隆博纳（1557-1585），罗马教皇西克斯图五世的甥女，为英国剧作家韦伯斯特的悲剧(白魔)中的女主人公。此处为一只网球的外号。）高呢。”</p> 
<p>“轻一点，亲爱的，”霍尼彻奇太太说。</p> 
<p>“不过你瞧露西——嘴里在埋怨土星，可手里一直握着俊白魔，准备出击。对了，明妮，朝她冲过去——用球拍打她的小腿——打她的小腿！”</p> 
<p>露西跌倒在地，俊白魔从她的手里滚了出去。</p> 
<p>毕比先生把球捡起来说：“对不起，这只球的名字叫维托利亚-科隆博纳。”可是他的纠正并没有受到人们注意。</p> 
<p>弗雷迪把小女孩逗弄得疯疯癫癫，很有一手，因此不过片刻，就把明妮这个规规矩矩的孩子弄得大喊大叫，闹得天昏地暗。塞西尔在屋内听到她们的声音，他虽然有许多有趣的消息，但是生怕被网球打中，因此没有走到草地上来把消息告诉大家。他可不是懦夫，他能像任何男子汉一样忍受必要的痛苦。不过他非常讨厌年轻人对身体施用暴力。他是多么正确呀！果然这一切以哭声告终。</p> 
<p>“我希望两位艾伦小姐能见到这场面，”毕比先生发表意见说，那时露西正好在护理受伤的明妮，而她自己却被她弟弟抱起来，弄得双脚离了地。</p> 
<p>“那两位艾伦小姐是谁？”弗雷迪气喘吁吁地说。</p> 
<p>“她们已经租下了希西别墅。”</p> 
<p>“不是这个姓氏——”</p> 
<p>就在这当儿他的脚滑了一下，他们全都乐呵呵地跌倒在草地上。这样过了一会儿。</p> 
<p>“不是什么姓氏？”露西问，她弟弟的头倒在她的膝上。</p> 
<p>“不是艾伦。那个租下哈里爵士的别墅的人不叫这个。”</p> 
<p>“简直是胡闹，弗雷迪！这件事你根本不知道。”</p> 
<p>“你自己才是胡闹！我刚才还见到过他。他对我说，‘嗯哼！霍尼彻奇”’——弗雷迪的摹仿能力并不高明——…嗯哼！嗯哼！我终于找到了真正称一称一称一心的房客。’我说，‘好哇，老兄！’我还拍拍他的后背呢！”</p> 
<p>“一点不错。是那两位艾伦小姐吧？”</p> 
<p>“好像不是。倒有点像是安德森。”</p> 
<p>“噢，天哪，可不能再来一笔糊涂账了！”霍尼彻奇太太嚷道。“露西，你看到我是不会错的了吧？我说过别管希西别墅的闲事。我是不会错的。我错的次数少到绝无仅有，使得我都感到不好意思呢。”</p> 
<p>“那只是弗雷迪的又一笔糊涂账罢了。弗雷迪甚至连他自以为租下了那所房子的人的姓氏都不知道。”</p> 
<p>“不，我是知道的。我想起来了。是艾默森。”</p> 
<p>“什么姓氏？”</p> 
<p>“艾默森。随便你愿意赌什么，我都奉陪。”</p> 
<p>“哈里爵士这个人真是变化多端，”露西平静地说。“我要是根本没操这份心就好了。”</p> 
<p>说着她仰卧在草地上，眼睛望着万里晴空。毕比先生对她一天比一天器重，当下低声对他的侄女说，要是碰上那么一点不顺心的事，这就是应当采取的态度。</p> 
<p>同一时刻，新房客的姓氏也分散了霍尼彻奇太太的注意力，使她不再热衷考虑自己的能力。</p> 
<p>“弗雷迪，是艾默森吧？你知道这艾默森是什么样的人家吗？”</p> 
<p>“我还不知道他们是不是姓艾默森呢！”弗雷迪回答，他是个具有民主思想的人。像对他姐姐和大多数青年人一样，平等思想很自然地对他具有吸引力，而世界上确实存在各种各样的艾默森这一无可辩驳的事实使他烦恼得异乎寻常。</p> 
<p>“我相信他们是正派人。好吧，露西”——她正又一次坐起来——“我看你露出不屑的样子，大概认为你妈妈是个势利小人吧！可是世界上确实有正派人和不正派人的区别，假装没有这种区别实际上是一种做作。”</p> 
<p>“艾默森这个姓很普通，”露西说。</p> 
<p>她正在向旁边看。她坐在岬角上，一眼望去，可以看到下面一座座愈来愈低的苍松覆盖的山岬，一直伸人威尔德地区。从花园愈往下走，这横向的景色愈加绚丽灿烂。</p> 
<p>“弗雷迪，我只是想说，我想他们不会是那位姓艾默森的哲学家（译注：①该是指美国著名思想家、作家爱默生1830-1882）的亲戚吧。那位哲学家可真让人受不了。请问，你现在满意了吗？”</p> 
<p>“嗯，是的，满意了，”他咕哝道。“而且你也会满意的，因为他们是塞西尔的朋友；所以”——他的语气充满了挖苦——“你和其他乡绅家庭可以完全放心地去串门。”</p> 
<p>“塞西尔的朋友？”露西叫了起来。</p> 
<p>“别这么粗鲁，亲爱的，”她母亲平静地说。“露西，别这么尖叫。你现在正在养成这种新的坏习惯。”</p> 
<p>“不过，难道塞西尔已经——”</p> 
<p>“是塞西尔的朋友嘛，”他重复道，…那当然是十分称一称一心的了。嗯哼！霍尼彻奇，我刚才已拍电报给他们了。…</p> 
<p>露西从草地上站了起来。</p> 
<p>这一下使她很难堪。毕比先生非常同情她。她只要相信这次为艾伦小姐的事所受到的怠慢出自哈里·奥特韦爵士，便能大大方方地忍着。可是当她听说这部分地是由于她的恋人插手时，她就有足够的理由“尖叫”起来。维斯先生喜欢捉弄人——他做得比捉弄人还要过分：从中作梗给予他幸灾乐祸的喜悦。这一点教区长很清楚，便比往常更慈祥地望着霍尼彻奇小姐。</p> 
<p>当她大声说“可是塞西尔的那两位艾默森先生——他们不可能就是～要知道——”时，教区长并不觉得这些话很奇怪，倒是从中看到了一个机会，可以转变话题，好让她恢复镇静。他就用下面的话岔开：</p> 
<p>“你说的是曾经去过佛罗伦萨的那两位艾默森先生？不，我想不会是他们。他们和维斯先生的朋友们可能相差一大截呢。啊，霍尼彻奇太太，他们是一对怪人！真是最最怪的人！至于我们，倒是顶喜欢他们的，不是吗？”他问露西。“为了紫罗兰还闹过一场大笑话呢！他们采了许多紫罗兰，把两位艾伦小姐房间里的花瓶都插满了，就是现在来不了希西别墅的那两位。两位可怜的小老太太！她们又震惊、又高兴。这是凯瑟琳小姐最得意地讲述的故事之一。它是这样开头的：‘我亲爱的姐姐最喜欢花。’她们发现整个房间是一片蓝色——花瓶里、水瓶里都是这样——而这故事是这样结束的：．这样缺乏绅士风度，却又这样美好。真叫人难堪啊！’是的，我老是把那两位佛罗伦萨的艾默森先生同紫罗兰联系起来。”</p> 
<p>“败北将军这次可镇住你了，”弗雷迪说，没有注意到他姐姐的脸已涨得绯红。她无法恢复镇静。毕比先生注意到了，便继续努力转换话题。</p> 
<p>“那两位艾默森先生是父子两人——儿子是个漂亮的小伙子，即便算不上是个好青年；我认为他并不蠢，但是很不成熟——悲观等等。我们特别欣赏的是那位父亲——一个极其容易感情用事的宝贝，而人们却说他谋害了他的妻子。”</p> 
<p>处于平时的正常心态，毕比先生是不会转述这种流言蜚语的，可是他此时正努力设法庇护碰到了小小的麻烦的露西。他脑子里想到什么无聊废话，嘴里也就重复一遍。</p> 
<p>“谋害他的妻子？”霍尼彻奇太太问。“露西，不要离开我们——还是继续玩你的击球游戏吧。说真的，贝尔托利尼公寓一定是个极其离奇的地方。这是我听到在那里的第二个谋杀者了。夏绿蒂到底在于什么，非要住到那里去？我说，日后我们真的一定要请夏绿蒂到这里来。”</p> 
<p>毕比先生实在想不起来有第二个谋杀者。他暗示女主人搞错了。霍尼彻奇太太面对这一不同意她意见的暗示，变得很激动。她完全可以肯定有人讲过同一故事，是关于另一位游客的。只是名字她记不起了。叫什么名字来着？哦，叫什么名字来着？她双手抱膝．思索着这名字。是萨克雷作品中的什么人的名字（译注：也许霍尼彻奇太太记错了，把哈里斯和萨克雷的长篇小说‘《亨利·埃斯蒙德》的主人公亨利（呢称哈里）混为一谈了）。她敲敲她那主妇的前额。</p> 
<p>露西问她弟弟塞西尔是不是在屋内。</p> 
<p>“喂，不要走！”他叫起来，试图抓住她的足踝。</p> 
<p>“我一定得走，”她严肃地说。“别胡闹了。你玩的时候总是胡来一气。”</p> 
<p>她离开他们时，她母亲高叫一声“哈里斯！”，使平静的空气颤动起来，也提醒她，人家对她说了谎，还没有纠正过来。竟然是这样愚蠢的谎话，然而却使她失魂落魄，把这两位艾默森先生，塞西尔的朋友，与两个普普通通的游客联系起来。迄今为止，她总是习惯于讲真话。她体会到今后一定要提高警惕，还要——完全讲真话？好吧，无论如何，她一定不可以说谎。她急匆匆地向花园上方走去，脸颊还是因羞愧而发红。她确信只要塞西尔一句话就足以抚慰她了。</p> 
<p>“塞西尔！”</p> 
<p>“喂！”他喊道，一面将身子探出吸烟室窗户。他看来情绪非常好。“我刚才还在盼着你到这里来呐！你们吵吵闹闹，我全听见了，不过这里还有更有趣的事呢！我，甚至我也替喜剧女神打了一次漂亮的胜仗。乔治·梅瑞狄斯（译注：乔治.梅瑞狄斯(1828-1909)，英国诗人、小说家。他的《论喜剧与喜剧精神的作用》一文受到很高的评价）是对的——喜剧的缘由与真理的缘由其实是相同的；而我，甚至我也替多灾多难的希西别墅找到了房客。别生气！别生气！你了解全部情况后会原谅我的。”</p> 
<p>塞西尔面带笑容时是很有魅力的．而她的那些荒谬可笑的不祥预感一下子就被他驱散了。</p> 
<p>“我都听说了，”她说，“弗雷迪告诉我们了。塞西尔，你真坏！我想我一定得原谅你。你想想，我花了那么多心血，结果却是一场空！当然哕，那两位艾伦小姐确实比较乏味，而我宁可要你的那些可爱的朋友。不过你不应该这样戏弄人。”</p> 
<p>“我的朋友？”塞西尔大笑。“可是，露西，真正的笑话还在后面呢！你过来。”可是她仍然站在原来的地方。“你知道我在哪里遇到这些称心的房客吗？在国家美术馆，上星期我去看妈妈的时候。”</p> 
<p>“在那儿会遇到熟人，真怪！”她神经紧张地说。“我不太明白。”</p> 
<p>“在翁布里亚（译注：翁布里亚，意大利中部的一地区，位于佛罗伦萨的东南）室。完全是萍水相逢。他们正在欣赏卢卡·西纽雷利（译注：卢卡·西纽雷利（1445? -1523），意大利画家，绘有不少宗教题材的作品）的作品——当然I罗，这是相当愚蠢的。不管怎么样，我们开始交谈，他们使我着实感到来劲儿。他们去过意大利。”</p> 
<p>“不过，塞西尔——”</p> 
<p>他兴高采烈地说下去。</p> 
<p>“在交谈中，他们说起要在乡下租一幢别墅——父亲将住在那里，儿子则从城里回来过周末。我就想‘这可是让哈里爵士出洋相的一次好机会！’就记下了他们的地址和在伦敦的一个保证人，发现实际上他们不是什么坏人——这实在太有趣了——我就写信给他，要弄清——”</p> 
<p>“塞西尔！这样做不公平。我很可能以前遇见过他们——”</p> 
<p>他把她压下去。</p> 
<p>“非常公平。对势利小人的任何惩罚都是公平的。那个老头儿将会对整个邻里带来天大的好处。哈里爵士的那一套‘家道中落的大家闺秀’的论调，实在太讨人厌了。我早就想在什么时候教训他一顿。不，露西，不同阶级的人应该混合在一起，过不了多久你就会同意我这观点的。应该相互通婚一等等等等。我是相信民主的——”</p> 
<p>“不，你不相信民主，”她厉声说。“你不懂这个词儿的意义。”</p> 
<p>他凝视着她，又一次感到她不像达-芬奇画中的人物了。“不，你不相信民主！”她的脸缺乏艺术情调－－倒像是一张暴躁的泼妇的脸。</p> 
<p>“这是不公平的，塞西尔。我指责你——我强烈地指责你。你没有权利破坏我为两位艾伦小姐所做的事，让我出丑。你把这行动称做出哈里爵士的洋相，可是你有没有认识到这全是以损害我为代价的？我认为你这样做是对我的大大不忠。”</p> 
<p>她撇下他走了。</p> 
<p>“发小姐脾气！”他心里想，扬起了眉毛。</p> 
<p>不，这不止是发小姐脾气——而是一种势利行为。只要她以为他自己的这两位时髦朋友将取代两位艾伦小姐，她就不在乎了。塞西尔发现这些新房客所起的教育作用可能颇有价值。他将宽容地对待这位父亲，同时设法引儿子开口，而他显得沉默寡言。为了维护喜剧女神与真理的利益，他要把他们带到风角来。</p>
