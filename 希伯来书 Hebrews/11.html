<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, and the sign that the things not seen are true. 
<br>11:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 古 人 在 这 信 上 得 了 美 好 的 证 据 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For by it the elders obtained a good report. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For by it our fathers had God's approval. 
<br>11:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 们 因 着 信 ， 就 知 道 诸 世 界 是 借 神 话 造 成 的 。 这 样 ， 所 看 见 的 ， 并 不 是 从 显 然 之 物 造 出 来 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; By faith it is clear to us that the order of events was fixed by the word of God, so that what is seen has not been made from things which only seem to be. 
<br>11:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 亚 伯 因 着 信 献 祭 与 神 ， 比 该 隐 所 献 的 更 美 ， 因 此 便 得 了 称 义 的 见 证 ， 就 是 神 指 他 礼 物 作 的 见 证 。 他 虽 然 死 了 ， 却 因 这 信 仍 旧 说 话 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; By faith Abel made a better offering to God than Cain, and he had witness through it of his righteousness, God giving his approval of his offering: and his voice still comes to us through it though he is dead. 
<br>11:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 诺 因 着 信 被 接 去 ， 不 至 于 见 死 。 人 也 找 不 着 他 ， 因 为 神 已 经 把 他 接 去 了 。 只 是 他 被 接 去 以 先 ， 已 经 得 了 神 喜 悦 他 的 明 证 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; By faith Enoch was taken up to heaven so that he did not see death; he was seen no longer, for God took him away: for before he was taken, witness had been given that he was well-pleasing to God: 
<br>11:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 人 非 有 信 就 不 能 得 神 的 喜 悦 。 因 为 到 神 面 前 来 的 人 ， 必 须 信 有 神 ， 且 信 他 赏 赐 那 寻 求 他 的 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And without faith it is not possible to be well-pleasing to him, for it is necessary for anyone who comes to God to have the belief that God is, and that he is a rewarder of all those who make a serious search for him. 
<br>11:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 挪 亚 因 着 信 ， 既 蒙 神 指 示 他 未 见 的 事 ， 动 了 敬 畏 的 心 ， 预 备 了 一 只 方 舟 ， 使 他 全 家 得 救 。 因 此 就 定 了 那 世 代 的 罪 ， 自 己 也 承 受 了 那 从 信 而 来 的 义 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; By faith Noah, being moved by the fear of God, made ready an ark for the salvation of his family, because God had given him news of things which were not seen at the time; and through it the world was judged by him, and he got for his heritage the righteousness which is by faith. 
<br>11:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 亚 伯 拉 罕 因 着 信 ， 蒙 召 的 时 候 ， 就 遵 命 出 去 ， 往 将 来 要 得 为 业 的 地 方 去 。 出 去 的 时 候 ， 还 不 知 往 哪 里 去 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; By faith Abraham did as God said when he was ordered to go out into a place which was to be given to him as a heritage, and went out without knowledge of where he was going. 
<br>11:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 因 着 信 ， 就 在 所 应 许 之 地 作 客 ， 好 像 在 异 地 居 住 帐 棚 ， 与 那 同 蒙 一 个 应 许 的 以 撒 ， 雅 各 一 样 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; By faith he was a wanderer in the land of the agreement, as in a strange land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, who had a part with him in the same heritage: 
<br>11:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 因 为 他 等 候 那 座 有 根 基 的 城 ， 就 是 神 所 经 营 所 建 造 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For he was looking for the strong town, whose builder and maker is God. 
<br>11:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 因 着 信 ， 连 撒 拉 自 己 ， 虽 然 过 了 生 育 的 岁 数 ， 还 能 怀 孕 。 因 他 以 为 那 应 许 他 的 是 可 信 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And by faith Sarah herself had power to give birth, when she was very old, because she had faith in him who gave his word; 
<br>11:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 所 以 从 一 个 仿 佛 已 死 的 人 就 生 出 子 孙 ， 如 同 天 上 的 星 那 样 众 多 ， 海 边 的 沙 那 样 无 数 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So that from one man, who was near to death, came children in number as the stars in heaven, or as the sand by the seaside, which may not be numbered. 
<br>11:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 这 些 人 都 是 存 着 信 心 死 的 ， 并 没 有 得 着 所 应 许 的 ， 却 从 远 处 望 见 ， 且 欢 喜 迎 接 ， 又 承 认 自 己 在 世 上 是 客 旅 ， 是 寄 居 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; All these came to their end in faith, not having had the heritage; but having seen it with delight far away, they gave witness that they were wanderers and not of the earth. 
<br>11:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 说 这 样 话 的 人 ， 是 表 明 自 己 要 找 一 个 家 乡 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For those who say such things make it clear that they are searching for a country for themselves. 
<br>11:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 若 想 念 所 离 开 的 家 乡 ， 还 有 可 以 回 去 的 机 会 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And truly if they had kept in mind the country from which they went out, they would have had chances of turning back. 
<br>11:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 却 羡 慕 一 个 更 美 的 家 乡 ， 就 是 在 天 上 的 。 所 以 神 被 称 为 他 们 的 神 ， 并 不 以 为 耻 。 因 为 他 已 经 给 他 们 预 备 了 一 座 城 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But now their desire is for a better country, that is to say, for one in heaven; and so it is no shame to God to be named their God; for he has made ready a town for them. 
<br>11:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 亚 伯 拉 罕 因 着 信 ， 被 试 验 的 时 候 ， 就 把 以 撒 献 上 。 这 便 是 那 欢 喜 领 受 应 许 的 ， 将 自 己 独 生 的 儿 子 献 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; By faith Abraham made an offering of Isaac, when he was tested: and he with whom the agreement had been made gave up as an offering the only son of his body, 
<br>11:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 论 到 这 儿 子 曾 有 话 说 ， 从 以 撒 生 的 才 要 称 为 你 的 后 裔 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Of whom it had been said, From Isaac will your seed take their name: 
<br>11:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 以 为 神 还 能 叫 人 从 死 里 复 活 。 他 也 仿 佛 从 死 中 得 回 他 的 儿 子 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Judging that God was able to give life even to the dead; and because of this he did get him back as if from death. 
<br>11:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 撒 因 着 信 ， 就 指 着 将 来 的 事 ， 给 雅 各 以 扫 祝 福 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; By faith Isaac, blessing Jacob and Esau, gave news of things to come. 
<br>11:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 雅 各 因 着 信 ， 临 死 的 时 候 ， 给 约 瑟 的 两 个 儿 子 各 自 祝 福 ， 扶 着 杖 头 敬 拜 神 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; By faith Jacob gave a blessing to the two sons of Joseph, when he was near to death; and gave God worship, supported by his stick. 
<br>11:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 瑟 因 着 信 ， 临 终 的 时 候 ， 提 到 以 色 列 族 将 来 要 出 埃 及 ， 并 为 自 己 的 骸 骨 留 下 遗 命 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; By faith Joseph, when his end was near, said that the children of Israel would go out of Egypt; and gave orders about his bones. 
<br>11:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 摩 西 生 下 来 ， 他 的 父 母 见 他 是 个 俊 美 的 孩 子 ， 就 因 着 信 把 他 藏 了 三 个 月 ， 并 不 怕 王 命 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; By faith Moses was kept secretly by his father and mother for three months after his birth, because they saw that he was a fair child; and they had no fear of the king's orders. 
<br>11:24 [hgb]&nbsp; 摩 西 因 着 信 ， 长 大 了 就 不 肯 称 为 法 老 女 儿 之 子 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; By faith Moses, when he became a man, had no desire to be named the son of Pharaoh's daughter; 
<br>11:25 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 宁 可 和 神 的 百 姓 同 受 苦 害 ， 也 不 愿 暂 时 享 受 罪 中 之 乐 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Feeling that it was better to undergo pain with the people of God, than for a short time to have a taste of the pleasures of sin; 
<br>11:26 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 看 为 基 督 受 的 凌 辱 ， 比 埃 及 的 财 物 更 宝 贵 。 因 他 想 望 所 要 得 的 赏 赐 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Judging a part in the shame of Christ to be better than all the wealth of Egypt; for he was looking forward to his reward. 
<br>11:27 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 因 着 信 就 离 开 埃 及 ， 不 怕 王 怒 。 因 为 他 恒 心 忍 耐 ， 如 同 看 见 那 不 能 看 见 的 主 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; By faith he went out of Egypt, not being turned from his purpose by fear of the wrath of the king; for he kept on his way, as seeing him who is unseen. 
<br>11:28 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 因 着 信 ， 就 守 逾 越 节 ， （ 守 或 作 立 ） 行 洒 血 的 礼 ， 免 得 那 灭 长 子 的 临 近 以 色 列 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; By faith he kept the Passover, and put the sign of the blood on the houses, so that the angel of destruction might not put their oldest sons to death. 
<br>11:29 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 因 着 信 ， 过 红 海 如 行 干 地 。 埃 及 人 试 着 要 过 去 ， 就 被 吞 灭 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; By faith they went through the Red Sea as if it had been dry land, though the Egyptians were overcome by the water when they made an attempt to do the same. 
<br>11:30 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 色 列 人 因 着 信 ， 围 绕 耶 利 哥 城 七 日 ， 城 墙 就 倒 塌 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; By faith the walls of Jericho came down, after they had been circled for seven days. 
<br>11:31 [hgb]&nbsp; 妓 女 喇 合 因 着 信 ， 曾 和 和 平 平 的 接 待 探 子 ， 就 不 与 那 些 不 顺 从 的 人 一 同 灭 亡 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; By faith Rahab, the loose woman, was not put to death with those who had gone against God's orders, because she had taken into her house in peace those sent to see the land. 
<br>11:32 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 又 何 必 再 说 呢 ？ 若 要 一 一 细 说 ， 基 甸 ， 巴 拉 ， 参 孙 ， 耶 弗 他 ， 大 卫 ， 撒 母 耳 ， 和 众 先 知 的 事 ， 时 候 就 不 够 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; What more am I to say? For there would not be time to give the stories of Gideon, Barak, Samson, and Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets: 
<br>11:33 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 因 着 信 ， 制 伏 了 敌 国 ， 行 了 公 义 ， 得 了 应 许 ， 堵 了 狮 子 的 口 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Who through faith overcame kingdoms, did righteousness, got their reward, kept the mouths of lions shut, 
<br>11:34 [hgb]&nbsp; 灭 了 烈 火 的 猛 势 ， 脱 了 刀 剑 的 锋 刃 ， 软 弱 变 为 刚 强 ， 争 战 显 出 勇 敢 ， 打 退 外 邦 的 全 军 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Put out the power of fire, got safely away from the edge of the sword, were made strong when they had been feeble, became full of power in war, and put to flight the armies of the nations. 
<br>11:35 [hgb]&nbsp; 有 妇 人 得 自 己 的 死 人 复 活 ， 又 有 人 忍 受 严 刑 ， 不 肯 苟 且 得 释 放 ， （ 释 放 原 文 作 赎 ） 为 要 得 着 更 美 的 复 活 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Women had their dead given back to them living; others let themselves be cruelly attacked, having no desire to go free, so that they might have a better life to come; 
<br>11:36 [hgb]&nbsp; 又 有 人 忍 受 戏 弄 ， 鞭 打 ， 捆 锁 ， 监 禁 ， 各 等 的 磨 炼 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And others were tested by being laughed at or by blows, and even with chains and prisons: 
<br>11:37 [hgb]&nbsp; 被 石 头 打 死 ， 被 锯 锯 死 ， 受 试 探 ， 被 刀 杀 。 披 着 绵 羊 山 羊 的 皮 各 处 奔 跑 ， 受 穷 乏 ， 患 难 ， 苦 害 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; They were stoned, they were cut up with knives, they were tested, they were put to death with the sword, they went about in sheepskins and in goatskins; being poor and in pain and cruelly attacked, 
<br>11:38 [hgb]&nbsp; 在 旷 野 ， 山 岭 ， 山 洞 ， 地 穴 ， 飘 流 无 定 。 本 是 世 界 不 配 有 的 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Wandering in waste places and in mountains and in holes in the rocks; for whom the world was not good enough. 
<br>11:39 [hgb]&nbsp; 这 些 人 都 是 因 信 得 了 美 好 的 证 据 ， 却 仍 未 得 着 所 应 许 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And not one of these got the good things of the agreement, though they all had a good record through faith, 
<br>11:40 [hgb]&nbsp; 因 为 神 给 我 们 预 备 了 更 美 的 事 ， 叫 他 们 若 不 与 我 们 同 得 ， 就 不 能 完 全 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Because God had kept some better thing for us, so that it was not possible for them to become complete without us.
