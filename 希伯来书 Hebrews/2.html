<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For this reason there is the more need for us to give attention to the things which have come to our ears, for fear that by chance we might be slipping away. 
<br>2:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 借 着 天 使 所 传 的 话 ， 既 是 确 定 的 ， 凡 干 犯 悖 逆 的 ， 都 受 了 该 受 的 报 应 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Because if the word which came through the angels was fixed, and in the past every evil act against God's orders was given its full punishment; 
<br>2:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 们 若 忽 略 这 么 大 的 救 恩 ， 怎 能 逃 罪 呢 ？ 这 救 恩 起 先 是 主 亲 自 讲 的 ， 后 来 是 听 见 的 人 给 我 们 证 实 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; What will come on us, if we do not give our minds to such a great salvation? a salvation of which our fathers first had knowledge through the words of the Lord, and which was made certain to us by those to whom his words came; 
<br>2:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 神 又 按 自 己 的 旨 意 ， 用 神 迹 奇 事 ， 和 百 般 的 异 能 ， 并 圣 灵 的 恩 赐 ， 同 他 们 作 见 证 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And God was a witness with them, by signs and wonders, and by more than natural powers, and by his distribution of the Holy Spirit at his pleasure. 
<br>2:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 们 所 说 将 来 的 世 界 ， 神 原 没 有 交 给 天 使 管 辖 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For he did not make the angels rulers over the world to come, of which I am writing. 
<br>2:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 但 有 人 在 经 上 某 处 证 明 说 ， 人 算 什 么 ， 你 竟 顾 念 他 ， 世 人 算 什 么 ， 你 竟 眷 顾 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But a certain writer has given his witness, saying, What is man, that you keep him in mind? what is the son of man, that you take him into account? 
<br>2:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 叫 他 比 天 使 微 小 一 点 ， （ 或 作 你 叫 他 暂 时 比 天 使 小 ） 赐 他 荣 耀 尊 贵 为 冠 冕 ， 并 将 你 手 所 造 的 都 派 他 管 理 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; You made him a little lower than the angels; you gave him a crown of glory and honour, and made him ruler over all the works of your hands: 
<br>2:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 叫 万 物 都 服 在 他 的 脚 下 。 既 叫 万 物 都 服 他 ， 就 没 有 剩 下 一 样 不 服 他 的 。 只 是 如 今 我 们 还 不 见 万 物 都 服 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; You put all things under his feet. For in making man the ruler over all things, God did not put anything outside his authority; though we do not see everything under him now. 
<br>2:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 惟 独 见 那 成 为 比 天 使 小 一 点 的 耶 稣 ， （ 或 作 惟 独 见 耶 稣 暂 时 比 天 使 小 ） 因 为 受 死 的 苦 ， 就 得 了 尊 贵 荣 耀 为 冠 冕 ， 叫 他 因 着 神 的 恩 ， 为 人 人 尝 了 死 味 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But we see him who was made a little lower than the angels, even Jesus, crowned with glory and honour, because he let himself be put to death so that by the grace of God he might undergo death for all men. 
<br>2:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 原 来 那 为 万 物 所 属 ， 为 万 物 所 本 的 ， 要 领 许 多 的 儿 子 进 荣 耀 里 去 ， 使 救 他 们 的 元 帅 ， 因 受 苦 难 得 以 完 全 ， 本 是 合 宜 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Because it was right for him, for whom and through whom all things have being, in guiding his sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation complete through pain. 
<br>2:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 因 那 使 人 成 圣 的 ， 和 那 些 得 以 成 圣 的 ， 都 是 出 于 一 。 所 以 他 称 他 们 为 弟 兄 ， 也 不 以 为 耻 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For he who makes holy and those who are made holy are all of one family; and for this reason it is no shame for him to give them the name of brothers, 
<br>2:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 说 ， 我 要 将 你 的 名 传 与 我 的 弟 兄 ， 在 会 中 我 要 颂 扬 你 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Saying, I will give the knowledge of your name to my brothers, I will make a song of praise to you before the church. 
<br>2:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 又 说 ， 我 要 倚 赖 他 。 又 说 ， 看 哪 ， 我 与 神 所 给 我 的 儿 女 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And again he says, I will put my faith in him. And again, See, I am here, and the children which God has given to me. 
<br>2:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 儿 女 既 同 有 血 肉 之 体 ， 他 也 照 样 亲 自 成 了 血 肉 之 体 。 特 要 借 着 死 ， 败 坏 那 掌 死 权 的 ， 就 是 魔 鬼 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And because the children are flesh and blood, he took a body himself and became like them; so that by his death he might put an end to him who had the power of death, that is to say, the Evil One; 
<br>2:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 并 要 释 放 那 些 一 生 因 怕 死 而 为 奴 仆 的 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And let those who all their lives were in chains because of their fear of death, go free. 
<br>2:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 并 不 救 拔 天 使 ， 乃 是 救 拔 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 后 裔 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For, truly, he does not take on the life of angels, but that of the seed of Abraham. 
<br>2:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 所 以 他 凡 事 该 与 他 的 弟 兄 相 同 ， 为 要 在 神 的 事 上 ， 成 为 慈 悲 忠 信 的 大 祭 司 ， 为 百 姓 的 罪 献 上 挽 回 祭 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Because of this it was necessary for him to be made like his brothers in every way, so that he might be a high priest full of mercy and keeping faith in everything to do with God, making offerings for the sins of the people. 
<br>2:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 自 己 既 然 被 试 探 而 受 苦 ， 就 能 搭 救 被 试 探 的 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For having been put to the test himself, he is able to give help to others when they are tested.
