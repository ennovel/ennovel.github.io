<br> 
<br> "Mr Frank!"
<br> 
<br> He turned. Bridgewater was pursuing him with something in his hand.
<br> 
<br> "Mr James told me to give you this."
<br> 
<br> Leavesley took the envelope presented to him, and Bridgewater bolted back to the office like a fat old rabbit, returning to its burrow.
<br> 
<br> In the envelope was a sovereign wrapped up in a half sheet of notepaper.
<br> 
<br> "Well, of all the meannesses!" said the dutiful nephew, pocketing the coin. "Still, it's decent of the old boy after my cheeking him like that. I have now one pound four. I'll go now and cheek aunt."
<br> 
<br> Miss Hancock was in; she had a handkerchief tied round her head, a duster in her hand; she had just given the cook warning and was in a debatable temper. She was[Pg 126] also in a dusting mood. She had plenty of servants, yet the inspiration came on her at times to tie a handkerchief round her head and dust.
<br> 
<br> "Well?" she said, as she led the way into the dining-room, and continued an attack she was making on the sideboard with her duster.
<br> 
<br> Leavesley had scarcely the slightest hope of financial assistance from this quarter. Patience had given him half-a-crown for a birthday present once when he was a little boy, and then worried it back from him and popped it into a missionary box for the Wallibooboo Islanders.
<br> 
<br> He never forgot that half-crown.
<br> 
<br> "I've come round to borrow some money from you," he said.
<br> 
<br> Patience sniffed, and went on with her dusting. Then suddenly she stopped, and, duster in hand, addressed him.
<br> 
<br> "Are you never going to do anything for a living? Have you no idea of the responsibilities of life? What are you going to do?"
<br> 
<br> "I'm going for a holiday in the country if I can scrape up money enough."
<br> 
<br> [Pg 127]
<br> 
<br> "You won't scrape it up here," said his aunt, continuing her dusting; then, for she was as inquisitive as a mongoose: "And what part of the country do you propose to take a holiday in?"
<br> 
<br> "Sonning-on-Thames."
<br> 
<br> "And where, may I ask, is Sonning-on-Thames?"
<br> 
<br> "It's on the Thames. See here, will you lend me five pounds?"
<br> 
<br> "Five what?"
<br> 
<br> "Pounds."
<br> 
<br> "What for?"
<br> 
<br> "To take a girl for a trip to Sonning-on-Thames."
<br> 
<br> Miss Hancock was sweeping with her duster round a glass arrangement made to hold flowers, in the convulsion incident on this statement she upset the thing and smashed it, much to Leavesley's delight.
<br> 
<br> He made for the door, and stood for a moment with the handle in his hand.
<br> 
<br> "I'm awfully sorry. Can I help you to pick it up?"
<br> 
<br> "Go away," said Miss Hancock, who was on her knees collecting the fragments of glass; "I want to see nothing more of you.[Pg 128] If you are lost to respectability you might retain at least common decency."
<br> 
<br> "Decency!"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, decency."
<br> 
<br> "I don't know that I've said anything indecent, or that there is anything indecent in going for a day on the river with a girl. Well, I'm going——" A luminous idea suddenly struck him. He knew the old maid's mind, and the terror she had of the bare idea of her brother marrying; he remembered the spruce appearance of his uncle that morning and the lavender satin necktie. "I say——"
<br> 
<br> "Well?"
<br> 
<br> "Talking of girls, how about uncle and his girl?"
<br> 
<br> "What's that you say!"
<br> 
<br> "Nothing, nothing; I oughtn't to have said anything about it. Well, I'm off."
<br> 
<br> He left the room hurriedly and shut the door, before she could call him back he was out of the house.
<br> 
<br> His random remark had hit the target plumb in the centre of the bull's-eye, and could he have known the agitation and irritation in the mind of his aunt he would have written off as paid his debt against the Wallibooboo Islanders.
<br> 
<br> [Pg 129]
<br> 
<br> The river was impossible now, and the whole thing had shrunk to luncheon at the studio and a visit to Madame Tussaud's or the Tower.
<br> 
<br> He reached the studio before twelve, and there he found waiting for him Mr Verneede and the Captain.
<br> 
<br> The Captain was in his trousers; he had come to show them as a proof of good faith and incidentally to get a glass of whisky. Leavesley gave him the whisky and sent him off, then he turned to Verneede.
<br> 
<br> "The whole thing has bust up. Miss Lambert is coming at one to go up the river and I have no money. Stoney broke; isn't it the deuce?"
<br> 
<br> "How very unfortunate!" said Mr Verneede. "How very unfortunate!"
<br> 
<br> "Unfortunate isn't the name for it."
<br> 
<br> "Did Miss Lambert write?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes—Oh, she told me to remember her to you, sent her love to you."
<br> 
<br> "Ah!"
<br> 
<br> "I've only got one pound four."
<br> 
<br> "But surely, my dear Leavesley—one pound four—why, it is quite a little sum of money."
<br> 
<br> "It's not enough to go up the river on—three of us."
<br> 
<br> [Pg 130]
<br> 
<br> "Why go up the river?"
<br> 
<br> "Where else can we go?"
<br> 
<br> "I have an idea," said Mr Verneede. "May I propound it?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes."
<br> 
<br> "Have you ever heard of Epping Forest?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes."
<br> 
<br> "Why not go there and spend a day amidst the trees, the greenery, the blue sky, the——"
<br> 
<br> "What would it cost?"
<br> 
<br> "A fractional sum; one takes the train to Woodford."
<br> 
<br> Leavesley reached for an A.B.C. guide and plunged into details.
<br> 
<br> "There are hamlets in the forest, where tea may be obtained in cottages at a reasonable cost——"
<br> 
<br> "We can just do it, I think," said Leavesley, who had been making distracted calculations on paper. He darted to the bell and rang it.
<br> 
<br> "Belinda," he said, when the slave of the bell made answer, "there's a lady coming here to luncheon, have you anything in the house?"
<br> 
<br> Belinda, with a far-away look in her eyes, made a mental survey of the larder, twiddling the door-handle to assist thought.
<br> 
<br> [Pg 131]
<br> 
<br> "There's a pie, sir, and sassiges, and a cold mutton chop. There's half a chicken——"
<br> 
<br> "That'll do, and get a salad. I'll run out and get some flowers and a bottle of claret."
