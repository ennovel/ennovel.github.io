"Nobody called this morning, I suppose?"
<br> 
<br> "Only the Capting, sir," replied Belinda, piling the tray. "He called at seven to borry your umbrella."
<br> 
<br> "Did you give it him?"
<br> 
<br> "No, sir, Mr Verneede's got it; you lent it to him the night before last, and he hasn't brought it back."
<br> 
<br> "Ah, so I did," said Mr Leavesley, squeezing Naples yellow from an utterly exhausted[Pg 2] looking tube. "So I did, so I did; that's the fifteenth umbrella or so that Verneede has annexed of mine: what does he do with them, do you think, Belinda?"
<br> 
<br> "I'm sure I don't know, sir," replied the maid-of-all-work, looking round the studio as if in search of inspiration, "unless he spouts them."
<br> 
<br> "That will do, Belinda," said the owner of the lost umbrellas, turning to his work, and the servant-maid departed.
<br> 
<br> It was a large, pleasant studio, furnished with very little affectation, and its owner was a slight, pleasant-faced youth, happy-go-lucky looking, with a glitter in his grey eyes suggesting a touch of genius or insanity in their owner.
<br> 
<br> He was an orphan blessed with a small competency. His income, to use his own formula, consisted of a hundred a year and an uncle. During the first four months or so of the year he spent the hundred pounds, during the rest of the year he squandered his uncle; that is to say he would have squandered him only for the fact that Mr James Hancock, of the firm of Hancock &amp; Hancock, solicitors, was a person most difficult to "negotiate."

<br> 
<br> Art, however, was looking up. He had sold several pictures lately. The morning mists on the road to success were clearing away, leaving to the view in a prospect distant tremulous and golden the mysterious city of attainment.
<br> 
<br> He would have whistled as he worked only that he was smoking.
<br> 
<br> Through the open windows came the pulse-like sound of the omnibuses in the King's Road, the sleigh bells of the hansoms, the rattle of the coster's barrow, and voices.
<br> 
<br> As he painted, the sounds outside brought before him the vision of the King's Road, Chelsea, where flaming June was also at work with her golden brush and palette of violet colours.
<br> 
<br> He saw in imagination the scarlet pyramids of strawberries in the shops. The blazing barrow of flowers all a-growing and a-blowing, the late-June morning crowd, and through the crowd wending its way the figure of a girl.
<br> 
<br> He was in love.
<br> 
<br> In the breast-pocket of his coat (on the heart side) lay a letter he had received by the early morning post. The handwriting[Pg 4] was large and generous and careless, for no man living could tell the "m's" from the "w's," or the "t's" from the "l's." It ran somewhat to this effect:
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Laurels, Highgate.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Father is worrying dreadfully, and I want your advice. I think I will be in the King's Road to-morrow, and will call on you. Excuse this scrawl.—In wild haste,
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fanny Lambert.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How's the picture?"
<br> 
<br> Occasionally as he painted he touched his coat where the letter lay, as if to make sure of its presence.
<br> 
<br> Suddenly he ceased working. There was a step on the stairs, a knock at the door. Could it be?——
