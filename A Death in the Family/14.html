They could not see his face in the dark hallway but by his tight, set way of walking, they were virtually sure. They were all but blocking his way. Instead of going into the hall to meet him, they drew aside to let him into the kitchen. He did not hesitate with their own moment’s hesitation but came straight on, his mouth a straight line and his eyes like splintered glass, and without saying a word he put his arms around his aunt so tightly that she gasped, and lifted her from the floor. “Mary,” Hannah whispered, close to his ear; he looked; there she stood waiting, her eyes, her face, like that of an astounded child which might be pleading, Oh, don’t hit me; and before he could speak he heard her say, thinly and gently, “He’s dead, Andrew, isn’t he?” and he could not speak, but nodded, and he became aware that he was holding his aunt’s feet off the floor and virtually breaking her bones, and his sister said, in the same small and unearthly voice, “He was dead when you got there”; and again he nodded; and then he set Hannah down carefully on her feet and, turning to his sister, took her by her shoulders and said, more loudly than he had expected, “He was instantly killed,” and he kissed her upon the mouth and they embraced, and without tears but with great violence he sobbed twice, his cheek against hers, while he stared downwards through her loose hair at her humbled back and at the changeful blinking of the linoleum; then, feeling her become heavy against him, said, “Here, Mary,” catching her across the shoulders and helping her to a chair, just as she, losing strength in her knees, gasped, “I’ve got to sit down,” and looked timidly towards her aunt, who at the same moment saying, in a broken voice, “Sit down, Mary,” was at her other side, her arm around her waist and her face as bleached and shocking as a skull. She put an arm tightly around each of them and felt gratitude and pleasure, in the firmness and warmth of their moving bodies, and they walked three abreast (like bosom friends, it occurred to her. the three Musketeers) to the nearest chair; and she could see Andrew twist it towards her with his outstretched left hand, and between them, slowly, they let her down into it, and then she could see only her aunt’s face, leaning deep above her, very large and very close, the eyes at once intense and tearful behind their heavy lenses, the strong mouth loose and soft, the whole face terrible in love and grief, naked and undisciplined as she had never seen it before.</p> 
<p>“Let Papa know and Mama,” she whispered. “I promised.”</p> 
<p>“I will,” Hannah said, starting for the hall.</p> 
<p>“Walter’s bringing them straight up,” Andrew said. “They know by now.” He brought another chair. “Sit down, Aunt Hannah.” She sat and took both Mary’s hands in her own, on Mary’s knees, and realized that Mary was squeezing her hands with all her strength, and as strongly as she was able. She replied in kind to this constantly, shifting, almost writhing pressure.</p> 
<p>“Sit with us, Andrew,” Mary said, a little more loudly; he was already bringing a third chair and now he sat, and put his hands upon theirs, and, feeling the convulsing of her hands, thought, Christ, it’s as if she were in labor. And she is. Thus they sat in silence a few moments while he thought: now I’ve got to tell them how it happened. In God’s name, how can I begin!</p> 
<p>“I want whiskey,” Mary said, in a small, cold voice, and tried to get up.</p> 
<p>“I’ll get it,” Andrew said, standing.</p> 
<p>“You don’t know where it is,” she said, continuing to put aside their hands even after they were withdrawn. She got up and they stood as if respectfully aside and she walked between them and went into the hall; they heard her rummaging in the closet, and looked at each other. “She needs it,” Hannah said.</p> 
<p>He nodded. He had been surprised, because of Jay, that there was whiskey in the house; and he was sick with self-disgust to have thought of it. “We all do,” he said.</p> 
<p>Without looking at them Mary went to the kitchen closet and brought a thick tumbler to the table. The bottle was almost full. She poured the tumbler full while they watched her, feeling they must not interfere, and took a deep gulp and choked on it, and swallowed most of it.</p> 
<p>“Dilute it,” Hannah said, slapping her hard between the shoulders and drying her lips and her chin with a dish towel. “It’s much too strong, that way.”</p> 
<p>“I will,” Mary croaked, and cleared her throat, “I will,” she said more clearly.</p> 
<p>“Just sit down, Mary,” Andrew and Hannah said at the same moment, and Andrew brought her a glass of water and Hannah helped her to her chair.</p> 
<p>“I’m going to have some, too,” Andrew said.</p> 
<p>“Goodness, do!” said Mary.</p> 
<p>“Let me fix us a good strong toddy,” Hannah said. “It’ll help you to sleep.”</p> 
<p>“I don’t want to sleep,” Mary said; she sipped at her whiskey and took plenty of the water. “I’ve got to learn how it happened.”</p> 
<p>“Aunt Hannah,” Andrew asked quietly, motioning towards the bottle.</p> 
<p>“Please.”</p> 
<p>While he broke ice and brought glasses and a pitcher of water, none of them spoke; Mary sat in a distorted kind of helplessness at once meek and curiously sullen, waiting. Months later, seeing a horse which had fallen in the street, Andrew was to remember her; and he was to remember it wasn’t drunkenness, either. It was just the flat of the hand of Death.</p> 
<p>“Let me pour my own,” Mary said. “Because,” she added with deliberation while she poured, “I want it just as strong as I can stand it.” She tasted the dark drink, added a little more whiskey, tasted again, and put the bottle aside. Hannah watched her with acute concern, thinking, if she gets drunk tonight, and if her mother sees her drunk, she’ll half die of shame, and thinking, nonsense. It’s the most sensible thing she could do.</p> 
<p>“Drink it very slowly, Mary,” Andrew said gently. “You aren’t used to it.”</p> 
<p>“I’ll take care,” Mary said.</p> 
<p>“It’s just the thing for shock,” Hannah said.</p> 
<p>Andrew poured two small straight drinks and gave one to his aunt; they drank them off quickly and took water, and he prepared two pale highballs.</p> 
<p>“Now, Andrew, I want to hear all about it,” Mary said.</p> 
<p>He looked at Hannah.</p> 
<p>“Mary,” he said. “Mama and Papa’ll be here any minute. You’d just have to hear it all over again. I’ll tell you, of course, if you prefer, right away but—could you wait?”</p> 
<p>But even as he was speaking she was nodding, and Hannah was saying, “Yes, child,” as all three thought of the confusions and repetitions which were, at best, inevitable. Now after a moment Mary said, “Anyway, you say he didn’t have to suffer. Instantly, you said.”</p> 
<p>He nodded, and said, “Mary, I saw him—at Roberts’. There was just one mark on his body.”</p> 
<p>She looked at him. “His head.”</p> 
<p>“Right at the exact point of the chin, a small bruise. A cut so small—they can close it with one stitch. And a little blue bruise on his lower lip. It wasn’t even swollen.”</p> 
<p>“That’s all,” she said.</p> 
<p>“All.” Hannah said.</p> 
<p>“That’s all,” Andrew said. “The doctor said it was concussion of the brain. It was instantaneous.”</p> 
<p>She was silent; he felt that she must be doubting it. Christ, he thought furiously, at least she could be spared that!</p> 
<p>“He can’t have suffered, Mary, not even for a fraction of a second. Mary, I saw his face. There wasn’t a glimmer of pain in it. Only—a kind of surprise. Startled.”</p> 
<p>Still she said nothing. I’ve got to make her sure of it, he thought. How in heaven’s name can I make it clearer? If necessary, I’ll get hold of the doctor and make him tell her hims ...</p> 
<p>“He never knew he was dying,” she said. “Not a minute, not one moment, to know, ‘my life is ending.’ ”</p> 
<p>Hannah put a quick hand to her shoulder; Andrew dropped to his knees before her; took her hands and said, most earnestly, “Mary, in God’s name be thankful if he didn’t! That’s a hideous thing for a man in the prime of life to have to know. He wasn’t a Christian, you know,” he blurted it fiercely. “He didn’t have to make his peace with God. He was a man, with a wife and two children, and I’d say that sparing him that horrible knowledge was the one thing we can thank God for!” And he added, in a desperate voice, “I’m so terribly sorry I said that, Mary!”</p> 
<p>But Hannah, who had been gently saying, “He’s right, Mary, he’s right, be thankful for that,” now told him quietly, “It’s all right, Andrew”; and Mary, whose eyes fixed upon his, had shown increasing shock and terror, now said tenderly, “Don’t mind, dear. Don’t be sorry. I understand. You’re right.”</p> 
<p>“That venomous thing I said about Christians,” Andrew said after a moment. “I can never forgive myself, Mary.”</p> 
<p>“Don’t grieve over it, Andrew. Don’t. Please. Look at me, please.” He looked at her. “It’s true I was thinking as I was bound to as a Christian, but I was forgetting we’re human, and you set me right and I’m thankful. You’re right. Jay wasn’t—a religious man, in that sense, and to realize could have only been—as you said for him. Probably as much so, even if he were religious.” She looked at him quietly. “So just please know I’m not hurt or angry. I needed to realize what you told me and I thank God for it.”</p> 
<p>There was a noise on the porch; Andrew got from his knees and kissed his sister on the forehead. “Don’t be sorry,” she said. He looked at her, tightened his lips, and hurried to the door.</p> 
<p>“Papa,” he said, and stood aside to let him past. His mother fumbled for his arm, and gripped it hard. He put his hand gently across her shoulders and said, next her ear, “They’re back in the kitchen”; she followed her husband. “Come in, Walter.”</p> 
<p>“Oh no. Thank you,” Walter Starr said. “These are family matters. But if there’s ...”</p> 
<p>Andrew took him by the arm. “Come in a minute, anyway,” he said. “I know Mary’ll want to thank you.”</p> 
<p>“Well now ...” Andrew led him in.</p> 
<p>“Papa,” Mary said, and got up and kissed him. He turned with her towards her mother. “Mama?” she said in a pinched, almost crying voice, and they embraced. “There, there, there,” her mother said in a somewhat cracked voice, clapping her loudly on the back. “Mary, dear. There, there, there!”</p> 
<p>She saw Walter Starr, looking as if he were sure he was unwelcome. “Why, Walter!” she whispered, and hurried to meet him. He put out his hand, looking frightened, and said, “Mrs. Follet, I just couldn’t ever ...”</p> 
<p>She threw her arms around him and kissed him on the cheek. “Bless you,” she whispered, crying softly.</p> 
<p>“There now,” he said, blushing deeply and trying to embrace and to sustain her without touching her too closely. “There now,” he said again.</p> 
<p>“I must stop this,” she said, drawing away from him and looking about wildly for something.</p> 
<p>“Here,” said Andrew and her father and Walter Starr, each offering a handkerchief. She took her brother’s, blew her nose, dried her eyes, and sat down. “Sit down, Walter.”</p> 
<p>“Oh thank you, no. I don’t think,” Walter said. “Only dropped in a moment; really must be off.”</p> 
<p>“Why Walter, what nonsense, you’re one of the family,” Mary said, and those who could hear nodded and murmured “Of course,” although they knew this was embarrassing for. him, and hoped he would go home.</p> 
<p>“Now that’s ever so kind,” Walter said, “but I can’t stay. Really must be off. Now if ...”</p> 
<p>“Walter, I want to thank you,” she said; for now she too had reconsidered.</p> 
<p>“So do we all,” Andrew said.</p> 
<p>“More than I can say,” Mary finished.</p> 
<p>He shook his head. “Nothing. Nothing,” he said. “Now I just want you to know, if there’s anything in the world I can do, be of help in any way, let me please, don’t hesitate to tell me.</p> 
<p>“Thank you, Walter. And if there is, we certainly will. Gratefully.”</p> 
<p>“Good night then.”</p> 
<p>Andrew walked with him to the front door. “Just let me know, Andrew. Anything,” Walter said.</p> 
<p>“I will and thank you,” Andrew replied. Their eyes met, and for a moment both were caught in astonishment. He wishes it was me! Andrew thought. He wishes it was himself! Walter thought. Perhaps I do, too, Andrew thought, and once again, as he had felt when he first saw the dead body, he felt absurd, ashamed, guilty almost of cheating, even of murder, in being alive.</p> 
<p>“Why Jay, of all people?” Andrew said, in a low voice.</p> 
<p>Still watching his splintered eyes, Walter heavily shook his head.</p> 
<p>“Good night, Andrew.”</p> 
<p>“Good night, Walter.”</p> 
<p>He shut the door.</p> 
<p>Mary’s father caught her eye; with his chin he beckoned her to a corner of the kitchen. “I want to talk to you alone a minute.” he said in a low voice.</p> 
<p>She looked at him thoughtfully, then took her glass from the table, said, “Excuse us a minute,” over her shoulder, and ushered him into the room she had prepared for her husband. She turned on the bedside lamp, quietly closed both doors, and stood looking at him, waiting.</p> 
<p>“Sit down, Poll,” he said.</p> 
<p>She looked about. One of them would have to sit on the bed. It was neatly laid open, cool and pleasant below the plumped pillows.</p> 
<p>“I had it all ready,” she said, “but he never came back.”</p> 
<p>“What’s that?”</p> 
<p>“Nothing, Papa.”</p> 
<p>“Don’t stay on your feet,” he said. “Let’s sit down.”</p> 
<p>“I don’t care to.”</p> 
<p>He came over to her and took her hand and looked at her searchingly. Why he’s just my height, she realized again. She saw how much his eyes, in sympathy and pain, were like his sister’s, tired, tender and resolute beneath the tired, frail eyelids. He could not speak at first.</p> 
<p>You’re a good man, she said to herself, and her lips moved. A good, good man. My father. In an instant she experienced afresh the whole of their friendship and estrangement. Her eyes filled with tears and her mouth began to tremble. “Papa,” she said. He took her close to him and she cried quietly.</p> 
<p>“It’s hell, Poll,” she heard him say. “Just hell. It’s just plain bell.” For a few moments she sobbed so deeply that he said nothing more, but only stroked the edge of her back, over and over, from her shoulder to her waist, and cried out within himself in fury and disgust, Goddamn it! God damn such a life! She’s too young for this. And thinking of that, it occurred to him that it was at just her age that his own life had had its throat twisted, and not by death, but by her own birth and her brother’s.</p> 
<p>“But you gotta go through with it,” he said.</p> 
<p>Against his shoulder he could feel her vigorous nodding. You will, he thought; you’ve got spunk.</p> 
<p>“No way out of it,” he said.</p> 
<p>“I think I will sit down.” She broke from him and with an almost vindictive sense of violation sat heavily at the edge of the bed, just where it was turned down, next the plumped pillows. He turned the chair and sat with her knee to knee.</p> 
<p>“Something I’ve got to tell you,” he said.</p> 
<p>She looked at him and waited.</p> 
<p>“You remember what Cousin Patty was like? When she lost George?”</p> 
<p>“Not very well. I wasn’t more than five or six.”</p> 
<p>“Well, I do. She ran around like a chicken with its head off. ‘Oh, why does it have to be me? What did I ever do that it happened to me?’ Banging her head against the furniture, trying to stab herself with her scissors, yelling like a stuck pig: you could hear her in the next block.”</p> 
<p>Her eyes became cold. “You needn’t worry,” she said.</p> 
<p>“I don’t, because you’re not a fool. But you’d better, and that’s what I want to warn you about.”</p> 
<p>She kept looking at him.</p> 
<p>“See here, Poll,” he said. “It’s bad enough right now, but it’s going to take a while to sink in. When it really sinks in it’s going to be any amount worse. It’ll be so much worse you’ll think it’s more than you can bear. Or any other human being. And worse than that, you’ll have to go through it alone, because there isn’t a thing on earth any of us can do to help, beyond blind animal sympathy.”</p> 
<p>She was gazing slantwise towards the floor in some kind of coldly patient irony; he felt sick to death of himself.</p> 
<p>“Look at me, Poll,” he said. She looked at him. “That’s when you’re going to need every ounce of common sense you’ve got,” he said. “Just spunk won’t be enough; you’ve got to have gumption. You’ve got to bear it in mind that nobody that ever lived is specially privileged; the axe can fall at any moment, on any neck, without any warning or any regard for justice. You’ve got to keep your mind off pitying your own rotten luck and setting up any kind of a howl about it. You’ve got to remember that things as bad as this and a hell of a lot worse have happened to millions of people before and that they’ve come through it and that you will too. You’ll bear it because there isn’t any choice—except to go to pieces. You’ve got two children to take care of. And regardless of that you owe it to yourself and you owe it to him. You understand me.”</p> 
<p>“Of course.”</p> 
<p>“I know it’s just unmitigated tommyrot to try to say a word about it. To say nothing of brass. All I want is to warn you that a lot worse is yet to come than you can imagine yet, so for God’s sake brace yourself for it and try to hold yourself together.” He said, with sudden eagerness, “It’s a kind of test, Mary. and it’s the only kind that amounts to anything. When something rotten like this happens. Then you have your choice. You start to really be alive, or you start to die. That’s all.” Watching her eyes, he felt fear for her and said, “I imagine you’re thinking about your religion.”</p> 
<p>“I am.” she said, with a certain cool pride.</p> 
<p>“Well, more power to you,” he said. “I know you’ve got a kind of help I could never have. Only one thing: take the greatest kind of care you don’t just—crawl into it like a hole and hide in it.”</p> 
<p>“I’ll take care,” she said.</p> 
<p>She means there is nothing I can tell her about that, he thought; and she is right.</p> 
<p>“Talk to Hannah about it,” he said.</p> 
<p>“I will, Papa.”</p> 
<p>“One other thing.”</p> 
<p>“Yes?”</p> 
<p>“There are going to be financial difficulties. We’ll see just what, and just how to settle them, course of time. I just want to take that worry off your hands. Don’t worry. We’ll work that out.”</p> 
<p>“Bless you, Papa.”</p> 
<p>“Rats. Drink your drink.”</p> 
<p>She drank deeply and shuddered.</p> 
<p>“Take all you can without getting drunk,” he said. “I wouldn’t give a whoop if you got blind drunk, best thing you could do. But you’ve got tomorrow to reckon with.” And tomorrow and tomorrow.</p> 
<p>“It doesn’t seem to have any effect,” she said, her voice still liquid. “The only times I drank before I had a terribly weak head, just one drink was enough to make me absolutely squiffy. But now it doesn’t seem to have any effect in the slightest.” She drank some more.</p> 
<p>“Good,” he said. “That can happen. Shock, or strain. I know once when your mother was very sick I ...” They both remembered her sickness. “No matter. Take all you want and I’ve more if you want it, but keep an eye on yourself. It can hit you like a ton of bricks.”</p> 
<p>“I’ll be careful.”</p> 
<p>“Time we went back to the others.” He helped her to her feet, and put a hand on her shoulder. “Just bear in mind what I said. It’s just a test, and it’s one that good people come through.”</p> 
<p>“I will, Papa, and thank you.”</p> 
<p>“I’ve got absolute confidence in you,” he said, wishing that this was entirely true, and that she could entirely care.</p> 
<p>“Thank you, Papa,” she said. “That’s going to be a great help to know.”</p> 
<p>Her hand on the doorknob, she turned off the light and preceded him into the kitchen.</p>
