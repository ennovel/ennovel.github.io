J, RESET HIS smooth watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. Five to three. Just nice time to walk to Artane. What was that boy's name again? Dignam, yes. Vere dignum et justum est. Brother Swan was the person to see. Mr Cunningham's letter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible. Good practical catholic: useful at mission time. 
<br> A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches, growled some notes. He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for aims towards the very reverend John Conmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown. 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not for long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey's words: If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old days. He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy M. P. 
<br> 
<br> -- Very well, indeed, father. And you father? 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxton probably for the waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere? Was that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that. And Mr Sheehy himself? Still in London. The house was still sitting, to be sure it was. Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed. Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach. O, yes: a very great success. A wonderful man really. 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M. P. looking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M. P. Yes, he would certainly call. 
<br> 
<br> -- Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy. 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee doffed his silk hat, as he took leave, at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again in going. He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste. 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan's droll eyes and cockney voice. 
<br> 
<br> -- Pilate! Wy don't you old back that owlin mob? 
<br> 
<br> A zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in his way. Beyond a doubt. He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish. Of good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not? 
<br> 
<br> O, lest he forget. That letter to father provincial. 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy square. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house: Aha. And were they good boys at school? O. That was very good now. And what was his name? Jack Sohan. And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other little man? His name was Brunny Lynam. O, that was a very nice name to have. 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street. 
<br> 
<br> -- But mind you don't post yourself into the box, little man, he said. 
<br> 
<br> The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed. 
<br> 
<br> -- O, sir. 
<br> 
<br> -- Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said. 
<br> 
<br> Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee's letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox, Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east. 
<br> 
<br> Mr Denis J. Maginni, professor of dancing, &amp;c., in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam's court. 
<br> 
<br> Was that not Mrs M'Guinness? 
<br> 
<br> Mrs M'Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she smiled. And Father Conmee smiled and saluted. How did she do? 
<br> 
<br> A fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to think that she was a pawnbroker. Well, now! Such a... what should he say?... such a queenly mien. 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left. The reverend T. R. Green B. A. will (D. V.) speak. The incumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words. But one should be charitable. Invincible ignorance. They acted according to their lights. 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road. It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be. 
<br> 
<br> A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. All raised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly. Christian brother boys. 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee smelled incense on his right hand as he walked. Saint Joseph's church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females. Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered. 
<br> 
<br> Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman. And now it was an office or something. 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter. He passed Grogan's the tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York. In America those things were continually happening. Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. Still, an act of perfect contrition. 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin's publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and were saluted. 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee passed H. J. O'Neill's funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay. A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable. In Youkstetter's, the pork-butcher's, Father Conmee observed pig's puddings, white and black and red, lying neatly curled in tubes. 
<br> 
<br> Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turf barge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him. It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs where men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people. 
<br> 
<br> On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S. J. of saint Francis Xavier's church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram. 
<br> 
<br> Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C. of saint Agatha's church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge. 
<br> 
<br> At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island. 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse. Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket. The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap. Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum. 
<br> 
<br> It was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father Conmee supposed. A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses. She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly. 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat. 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head. 
<br> 
<br> At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her. She passed out with her basket and a market net: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice bless you, my child, that they have been absolved, pray for me. But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures. 
<br> 
<br> From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grinned with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee. 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon of saint Peter Claver S. J. and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night. That book by the Belgian jesuit, Le Nombre des élus, seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea. Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D. V.) been brought. But they were God's souls created by God. It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say. 
<br> 
<br> At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn. 
<br> 
<br> The Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father Conmee, road and name. The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining. Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day. Those were oldworldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony. 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book Old Times in the Barony and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere. 
<br> 
<br> A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris, with her husband's brother? She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did. Only God knew and she and he, her husband's brother. 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for men's race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways. 
<br> 
<br> Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was humane and honoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit clusters. And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by don John Conmee. 
<br> 
<br> It was a charming day. 
<br> 
<br> The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind. Moutonner, the French said. A homely and just word. 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys' lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening. He was their rector: his reign was mild. 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out. An ivory bookmark told him the page. 
<br> 
<br> Nones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had come. 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee read in secret Pater and Ave and crossed his breast. Deus in adiutorium. 
<br> 
<br> He wamked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to Res in Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuotum veritas: in eternum omnia iudicia iustitu tu&amp;Aelig;. 
<br> 
<br> A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig. 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary. Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum. 
<br> 
<br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br> 
<br> Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings. Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway. There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out. 
<br> 
<br> Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge. 
<br> 
<br> Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted, chewing his blade of hay. 
<br> 
<br> Constable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day. 
<br> 
<br> -- That's a fine day, Mr Kelleher. 
<br> 
<br> -- Ay, Corny Kelleher said. 
<br> 
<br> -- It's very close, the constable said. 
<br> 
<br> Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin. 
<br> 
<br> -- What's the best news? he asked. 
<br> 
<br> -- I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated breath. 
<br> 
<br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br> 
<br> A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell's corner, skirting Rabaiotti's icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street. Towards Larry O'Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably 
<br> 
<br> -- For England... 
<br> 
<br> He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted and growled: 
<br> 
<br> -- home and beauty. 
<br> 
<br> J.J. O'Molloy's white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor. 
<br> 
<br> A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her. The sailor grumbled thanks and glanced sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides. 
<br> 
<br> He halted and growled angrily: 
<br> 
<br> -- For England... 
<br> 
<br> Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at his stump with their yellow-slobbered mouths. 
<br> 
<br> He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply: 
<br> 
<br> -- home and beauty. 
<br> 
<br> The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased. The blind of the window was drawn aside. A card Unfurnished Apartments slipped from the sash and fell. 
<br> 
<br> A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps. A woman's hand flung forth a coin over the area railings. It fell on the path. 
<br> 
<br> One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel's cap, saying: 
<br> 
<br> -- There, sir. 
<br> 
<br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br> 
<br> Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen. 
<br> 
<br> -- Did you put in the books? Boody asked. 
<br> 
<br> Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow. 
<br> 
<br> -- They wouldn't give anything on them, she said. 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble. 
<br> 
<br> -- Where did you try? Boody asked. 
<br> 
<br> -- M'Guinness's. 
<br> 
<br> Body stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table. 
<br> 
<br> -- Bad cess to her big face! she cried. 
<br> 
<br> Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes. 
<br> 
<br> -- What's in the pot? she asked. 
<br> 
<br> -- Shirts, Maggy said. 
<br> 
<br> Boody cried angrily: 
<br> 
<br> -- Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat? 
<br> 
<br> Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked: 
<br> 
<br> -- And what's in this? 
<br> 
<br> A heavy fume gushed in answer. 
<br> 
<br> -- Peasoup, Maggy said. 
<br> 
<br> -- Where did you get it? Katey asked. 
<br> 
<br> -- Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said. 
<br> 
<br> The lacquey rang his bell. 
<br> 
<br> -- Barang! 
<br> 
<br> Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily: 
<br> 
<br> -- Give us it here! 
<br> 
<br> Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. Katey, sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs. 
<br> 
<br> -- A good job we have that much. Where's Dilly? 
<br> 
<br> -- Gone to meet father, Maggy said. 
<br> 
<br> Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added: 
<br> 
<br> -- Our father who art not in heaven. 
<br> 
<br> Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey's bowl, exclaimed: 
<br> 
<br> -- Boody! For shame! 
<br> 
<br> A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and George's quay. 
<br> 
<br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br> 
<br> The blonde girl in Thornton's bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre. Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar. 
<br> 
<br> -- Put these in first, will you? he said. 
<br> 
<br> -- Yes, sir, the blond girl said, and the fruit on top. 
<br> 
<br> -- That'll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said. 
<br> 
<br> She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe shamefaced peaches. 
<br> 
<br> Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes, sniffing smells. 
<br> 
<br> H. E. L. Y.'S. filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane, plodding towards their goal. 
<br> 
<br> He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from his fob and held it at its chain's length. 
<br> 
<br> -- Can you send them by tram? Now? 
<br> 
<br> A darkbacked figure under Merchants' arch scanned books on the hawker's car. 
<br> 
<br> -- Certainly, sir. Is it in the city? 
<br> 
<br> -- O, yes, Blazes Boylan said. Ten minutes. 
<br> 
<br> The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil. 
<br> 
<br> -- Will you write the address, sir? 
<br> 
<br> Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her. 
<br> 
<br> -- Send it at once, will you? he said. It's for an invalid. 
<br> 
<br> -- Yes, sir. I will, sir. 
<br> 
<br> Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers' pocket. 
<br> 
<br> -- What's the damage? he asked. 
<br> 
<br> The blond girl's slim fingers reckoned the fruits. 
<br> 
<br> Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse. A young pullet. He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass. 
<br> 
<br> -- This for me? he asked gallantly. 
<br> 
<br> The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie a bit crooked, blushing. 
<br> 
<br> -- Yes, sir, she said. 
<br> 
<br> Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches. 
<br> 
<br> Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth. 
<br> 
<br> -- May I say a word to your telephone, missy? he asked roguishly. 
<br> 
<br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br> 
<br> -- Ma! Almidano Artifoni said. 
<br> 
<br> He gazed over Stephen's shoulder at Goldsmith's knobby poll. 
<br> 
<br> Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping frankly the handrests. Pale faces. Men's arms frankly round their stunted forms. They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed. 
<br> 
<br> -- Anch'io ho avuto di queste idee, Almidano Artifoni said, quand' ero giovine come Lei. Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia. è peccato. Perche la sua voce... sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via. Invece, Lei si sacrifica. 
<br> 
<br> -- Sacrifizio incruento, Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in slow swingswong from its midpoint, lightly. 
<br> 
<br> -- Speriamo, the round mustachioed face said pleasantly. Ma, dia retta a me. Ci rifletta. 
<br> 
<br> By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band. 
<br> 
<br> -- Ci riflettò, Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouser-leg. 
<br> 
<br> -- Ma, sul serio, eh? Almidano Artifoni said. 
<br> 
<br> His heavy hand took Stephen's firmly. Human eyes. They gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram. 
<br> 
<br> -- Eccolo, Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste. Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi. Addio, caro. 
<br> 
<br> -- Arrivederla, maestro, Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was freed. E grazie. 
<br> 
<br> -- Di che? Almidano Artifoni said. Scusi, eh? Tante belle cose! 
<br> 
<br> Almidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal, trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram. In vain he trotted, signalling in vain among the rout of bare-kneed gillies smuggling implements of music through Trinity gates. 
<br> 
<br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br> 
<br> Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of The Woman in White far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter. 
<br> 
<br> Too much mystery business in it. Is he in love with that one, Marion? Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye. 
<br> 
<br> The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them: six. 
<br> 
<br> Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard: 
<br> 
<br> -- 16 June 1904. 
<br> 
<br> Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny's corner and the slab where Wolfe Tone's statue was not, eeled themselves turning H. E. L. Y.'S and plodded back as they had come. 
<br> 
<br> Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses. Mustard hair and dauby cheeks. She's not nicelooking, is she? The way she is holding up her bit of a skirt. Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight. If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle's. They kick out grand. Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her. Hope to goodness he won't keep me here till seven. 
<br> 
<br> The telephone rang rudely by her ear. 
<br> 
<br> -- Hello. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. I'll ring them up after five. Only those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool. All right, sir. Then I can go after six if you're not back. A quarter after. Yes, sir. Twentyseven and six. I'll tell him. Yes: one, seven, six. 
<br> 
<br> She scribbled three figures on an envelope. 
<br> 
<br> -- Mr Boylan l Hello! That gentleman from Sport was in looking for you. Mr Lenehan, yes. He said he'll be in the Ormond at four. No, sir. Yes, sir. I'll ring them up after five. 
<br> 
<br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br> 
<br> Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch. 
<br> 
<br> -- Who's that? Ned Lambert asked. Is that Crotty? 
<br> 
<br> -- Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied, groping for foothold. 
<br> 
<br> -- Hello, Jack, is that yourself? Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches. Come on. Mind your steps there. 
<br> 
<br> The vesta in the clergyman's uplifted hand consumed itself In a long soft flame and was let fall. At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air closed round them. 
<br> 
<br> -- How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom. 
<br> 
<br> -- Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. We are standing in the historic council chamber of saint Mary's abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in 1534. This is the most historic spot in all Dublin. O'Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days. The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews' temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road. You were never here before, Jack, were you? 
<br> 
<br> -- No, Ned. 
<br> 
<br> -- He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory serves me. The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court. 
<br> 
<br> -- That's right, Ned Lambert said. That's quite right, sir. 
<br> 
<br> -- If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow me perhaps . 
<br> 
<br> -- Certainly, Ned Lambert said. Bring the camera whenever you like. I'll get those bags cleared away from the windows. You can take it from here or from here. 
<br> 
<br> In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor. 
<br> 
<br> From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard. 
<br> 
<br> -- I'm deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. I won't trespass on your valuable time... 
<br> 
<br> -- You're welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. drop in whenever you like. Next week, say. Can you see? 
<br> 
<br> -- Yes, yes. Good afternoon, Mr Lambert. Very pleased to have met you. 
<br> 
<br> -- Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered. 
<br> 
<br> He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars. With J.J. O'Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary's abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal, O'Connor, Wexford. 
<br> 
<br> He stood to read the card in his hand. 
<br> 
<br> -- The reverend Hugh C. Love, Rathcoffey. Present address: Saint Michael's, Sallins. Nice young chap he is. He's writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he told me. He's well up in history, faith. 
<br> 
<br> The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig. 
<br> 
<br> -- I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J.J. O'Molloy said. 
<br> 
<br> Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air. 
<br> 
<br> -- God, he cried. I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral. You know that one? I'm bloody sorry I did it, says he, but I declare to God I thought the archbishop was inside. He mightn't like it, though. What? God, I'll tell him anyhow. That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor. Hot members they were all of them, the Geraldines. 
<br> 
<br> The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried: 
<br> 
<br> -- Woa, sonny! 
<br> 
<br> He turned to J.J. O'Molloy and asked: 
<br> 
<br> -- Well, Jack. What is it? What's the trouble? Wait a while. Holdhard. 
<br> 
<br> With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant, sneezed loudly. 
<br> 
<br> -- Chow! he said. Blast you! 
<br> 
<br> -- The dust from those sacks, J.J. O'Molloy said politely. 
<br> 
<br> -- No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a... cold night before ... blast your soul... night before last... and there was a hell of a lot of draught... 
<br> 
<br> He held his handkerchief ready for the coming... 
<br> 
<br> -- I was... this morning... poor little... what do you call him... Chow!... Mother of Moses! 
<br> 
<br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br> 
<br> Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat. 
<br> 
<br> -- See? he said. Say it's turn six. In here, see. Turn Now On. 
<br> 
<br> He slid it into the left slot for them. It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six. 
<br> 
<br> Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of King's bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude. 
<br> 
<br> -- See? he said. See now the last one I put in is over here. Turns Over. The impact. Leverage, see? 
<br> 
<br> He showed them the rising column of disks on the right. 
<br> 
<br> -- Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over. 
<br> 
<br> -- See? Tom Rochford said. 
<br> 
<br> He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four. Turn Now On. 
<br> 
<br> -- I'll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him. One good turn deserves another. 
<br> 
<br> -- Do, Tom Rochford said. Tell him I'm Boylan with impatience. 
<br> 
<br> -- Goodnight, M'Coy said abruptly, when you two begin. 
<br> 
<br> Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it. 
<br> 
<br> -- But how does it work here, Tommy? he asked. 
<br> 
<br> -- Tooraloo, Lenehan said, see you later. 
<br> 
<br> He followed M'Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court. 
<br> 
<br> -- He's a hero, he said simply. 
<br> 
<br> -- I know, M'Coy said. The drain, you mean. 
<br> 
<br> -- Drain? Lenehan said. It was down a manhole. 
<br> 
<br> They passed Dan Lowry's musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile. 
<br> 
<br> Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M'Coy how the whole thing was. One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it half choked with sewer gas. Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky's vest and all, with the rope round him. And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up. 
<br> 
<br> -- The act of a hero, he said. 
<br> 
<br> At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street. 
<br> 
<br> -- This way, he said, walking to the right. I want to pop into Lynam's to see Sceptre's starting price. What's the time by your gold watch and chain? 
<br> 
<br> M'Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses' sombre office, then at O'Neill's clock. 
<br> 
<br> -- After three, he said. Who's riding her? 
<br> 
<br> -- O. Madden, Lenehan said. And a game filly she is. 
<br> 
<br> While he waited in Temple bar M'Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter. Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark. 
<br> 
<br> The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the vice-regal cavalcade. 
<br> 
<br> -- Even money, Lenehan said returning. I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn't an earthly. Through here. 
<br> 
<br> They went up the steps and under Merchants' arch. A dark-backed figure scanned books on the hawker's cart. 
<br> 
<br> -- There he is, Lenehan said. 
<br> 
<br> -- Wonder what he is buying, M'Coy said, glancing behind. 
<br> 
<br> -- Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye, Lenehan said. 
<br> 
<br> -- He's dead nuts on sales, M'Coy said. I was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob. There were fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails. Astronomy it was about. 
<br> 
<br> Lenehan laughed. 
<br> 
<br> -- I'll tell you a damn good one about comets' tails, he said. Come over in the sun. 
<br> 
<br> They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the river wall. 
<br> 
<br> Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks. 
<br> 
<br> -- There was a big spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said eagerly. The annual dinner you know. Boiled shirt affair. The lord mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was music. Bartell D'Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard. 
<br> 
<br> -- I know, M'Coy broke in. My missus sang there once. 
<br> 
<br> -- Did she? Lenehan said. 
<br> 
<br> A card Unfurnished Apartments reappeared on the windowsash of number 7 Eccles street. 
<br> 
<br> He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh. 
<br> 
<br> -- But wait till I tell you, he said. Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. Bloom and the wife were there. Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and cura?ao to which we did ample justice. Fast and furious it was. After liquids came solids. Cold joints galore and mince pies. 
<br> 
<br> -- I know, M'Coy said. The year the missus was there... 
<br> 
<br> Lenehan linked his arm warmly. 
<br> 
<br> -- But wait till I tell you, he said. We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o'clock the morning after the night before. Coming home it was a gorgeous winter's night on the Featherbed Mountain. Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other. We started singing glees and duets: Lo, the early beam of morning. She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt's port under her bellyband. Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me. Hell's delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her. Like that. 
<br> 
<br> He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning: 
<br> 
<br> -- I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time. Know what I mean? 
<br> 
<br> His hands moulded ample curves of air. He shut his eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips. 
<br> 
<br> -- The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. She's a gamey mare and no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules and the dragon and the whole jingbang lot. But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way. He knows them all, faith. At last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. And what star is that, Poldy? says she. By God, she had Bloom cornered. That one, is it? says Chris Callinan, sure that's only what you might call a pinprick. By God, he wasn't far wide of the mark. 
<br> 
<br> Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter. 
<br> 
<br> -- I'm weak, he gasped. 
<br> 
<br> M'Coy's white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave. Lenehan walked on again. He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly. He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M'Coy. 
<br> 
<br> -- He's a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. He's not one of your common or garden... you know... There's a touch of the artist about old Bloom. 
<br> 
<br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br> 
<br> Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk, then of Aristotle's Masterpiece. Crooked botched print. Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows. Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world. All butting with their skulls to get out of it. Child born every minute somewhere. Mrs Purefoy. 
<br> 
<br> He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: Tales of the Ghetto by Leopold von Sacher Masoch. 
<br> 
<br> -- That I had, he said, pushing it by. 
<br> 
<br> The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter. 
<br> 
<br> -- Them are two good ones, he said. 
<br> 
<br> Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth. He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain. 
<br> 
<br> On O'Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J. Maginni, professor of dancing &amp;c. 
<br> 
<br> Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. Fair Tyrants by James Lovebirch. Know the kind that is. Had it? Yes. 
<br> 
<br> He opened it. Thought so. 
<br> 
<br> A woman's voice behind the dingy curtain. Listen: The man. 
<br> 
<br> No: she wouldn't like that much. Got her it once. 
<br> 
<br> He read the other title: Sweets of Sin. More in her line. Let us see. 
<br> 
<br> He read where his finger opened. 
<br> 
<br> -- All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on wondrous gowns and costliest frillies. For him! For Raoul! 
<br> 
<br> Yes. This. Here. Try. 
<br> 
<br> -- Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her déshabillé. 
<br> 
<br> Yes. Take this. The end. 
<br> 
<br> -- You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eyeing her with a suspicious glare. The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint. An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly. 
<br> 
<br> Mr Bloom read again: The beautiful woman. 
<br> 
<br> Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yielded amid rumpled clothes. Whites of eyes swooning up. His nostrils arched themselves for prey. Melting breast ointments (For him! For Raoul!). Armpits' oniony sweat. Fishgluey slime (her heaving embonpoint!). Feel! Press! Crushed! Sulphur dung of lions! 
<br> 
<br> Young! Young! 
<br> 
<br> An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of chancery, king's bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the lord chancellor's court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation. 
<br> 
<br> Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy curtains. The shopman's uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing. He raked his throat rudely, spat phlegm on the floor. He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired. 
<br> 
<br> Mr Bloom beheld it. 
<br> 
<br> Mastering his troubled breath, he said: 
<br> 
<br> -- I'll take this one. 
<br> 
<br> The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum. 
<br> 
<br> -- Sweets of Sin, he said, tapping on it. That's a good one. 
<br> 
<br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br> 
<br> The lacquey by the door of Dillon's auctionrooms shook his handbell twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet. 
<br> 
<br> Dilly Dedalus, listening by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell, the cries of the auctioneer within. Four and nine. Those lovely curtains. Five shillings. Cosy curtains. Selling new at two guineas. Any advance on five shillings? Going for five shillings. 
<br> 
<br> The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it: 
<br> 
<br> -- Barang! 
<br> 
<br> Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint. J. A. Jackson, W. E. Wylie, A. Munro and H. T. Gahan, their stretched necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College Library. 
<br> 
<br> Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams's row. He halted near his daughter. 
<br> 
<br> -- It's time for you, she said. 
<br> 
<br> -- Stand up straight for the love of the Lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said. Are you trying to imitate your uncle John the cornetplayer, head upon shoulders? Melancholy God! 
<br> 
<br> Dilly shrugged her shoulders. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back. 
<br> 
<br> -- Stand up straight, girl, he said. You'll get curvature of the spine. Do you know what you look like? 
<br> 
<br> He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw. 
<br> 
<br> -- Give it up, father, Dilly said. All the people are looking at you. 
<br> 
<br> Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache. 
<br> 
<br> -- Did you get any money? Dilly asked. 
<br> 
<br> -- Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said. There is no-one in Dublin would lend me fourpence. 
<br> 
<br> -- You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes. 
<br> 
<br> -- How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek. 
<br> 
<br> Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James's street. 
<br> 
<br> -- I know you did, Dilly answered. Were you in the Scotch house now? 
<br> 
<br> -- I was not then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. Was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy? Here. 
<br> 
<br> He handed her a shilling. 
<br> 
<br> -- See if you can do anything with that, he said. 
<br> 
<br> -- I suppose you got five, Dilly said. Give me more than that. 
<br> 
<br> -- Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. You're like the rest of them, are you? An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died. But wait awhile. You'll all get a short shrift and a long day from me. Low blackguardism! I'm going to get rid of you. Wouldn't care if I was stretched out stiff. He's dead. The man upstairs is dead. 
<br> 
<br> He left her and walked on. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat. 
<br> 
<br> -- Well, what is it? he said, stopping. 
<br> 
<br> The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs. 
<br> 
<br> -- Barang! 
<br> 
<br> -- Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him. 
<br> 
<br> The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly: 
<br> 
<br> -- Bang! 
<br> 
<br> Mr Dedalus stared at him. 
<br> 
<br> -- Watch him, he said. It's instructive. I wonder will he allow us to talk. 
<br> 
<br> -- You got more than that, father, Dilly said. 
<br> 
<br> -- I'm going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. I'll leave you all where Jesus left the jews. Look, that's all I have. I got two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral. 
<br> 
<br> He drew forth a handful of copper coins nervously. 
<br> 
<br> -- Can't you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said. 
<br> 
<br> Mr Dedalus thought and nodded. 
<br> 
<br> -- I will, he said gravely. I looked all along the gutter in O'Connell street. I'll try this one now. 
<br> 
<br> -- You're very funny, Dilly said, grinning. 
<br> 
<br> -- Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something. I'll be home shortly. 
<br> 
<br> He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on. 
<br> 
<br> The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of Parkgate. 
<br> 
<br> -- I'm sure you have another shilling, Dilly said. 
<br> 
<br> The lacquey banged loudly. 
<br> 
<br> Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth: 
<br> 
<br> -- The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn't do anything! O, sure they wouldn't really! Is it little sister Monica! 
<br> 
<br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br> 
<br> From the sundial towards James's Gate walked Mr Kernan pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson boldly along James's street, past Shackleton's offices. Got round him all right. How do you do, Mr Crimmins? First rate, sir. I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico. How are things going? Just keeping alive. Lovely weather we are having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country. Those farmers are always grumbling. I'll just take a thimbleful of your best gin, Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that General Slocum explosion. Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties. And heartrending scenes. Men trampling down women and children. Most brutal thing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion: most scandalous revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst. What I can't understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that... Now you are talking straight, Mr Crimmins. You know why? Palmoil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look at that. And America they say is the land of the free. I thought we were bad here. 
<br> 
<br> I smiled at him. America, I said, quietly, just like that. What is it? The sweepings of every country including our own. Isn't that true? That's a fact. 
<br> 
<br> Graft, my dear sir. Well, of course, where there's money going there's always someone to pick it up. 
<br> 
<br> Saw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like a dressy appearance. Bowls them over. 
<br> 
<br> -- Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things? 
<br> 
<br> -- Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered stopping. 
<br> 
<br> Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter Kennedy, hairdresser. Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Scott of Dawson street. Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. Never built under three guineas. Fits me down to the ground. Some Kildare street club toff had it probably. John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me. 
<br> 
<br> Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows. Knight of the road. Gentleman. And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom again, sir. The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying has it. 
<br> 
<br> North wall and sir John Rogerson's quay, with hulls and anchorchains, sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the ferry-wash, Elijah is coming. 
<br> 
<br> Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. High colour, of course. Grizzled moustache. Returned Indian officer. Bravely he bore his stumpy body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. Is that Lambert's brother over the way, Sam? What? Yes. He's as like it as damn it. No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. Just a flash like that. Damn like him. 
<br> 
<br> Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath. Good drop of gin, that was. His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his fat strut. 
<br> 
<br> Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. Greasy black rope. Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant's wife drove by in her noddy. 
<br> 
<br> Let me see. Is he buried in saint Michan's? Or no, there was a midnight burial in Glasnevin. Corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall. Dignam is there now. Went out in a puff. Well, well. Better turn down here. Make a detour. 
<br> 
<br> Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the corner of Guinness's visitors' waitingroom. Outside the Dublin Distillers Company's stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins knotted to the wheel. Damn dangerous thing. Some Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens. Runaway horse. 
<br> 
<br> Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John Henry Menton's office, led his wife over O'Connell bridge, bound for the office of Messrs Collis and Ward. 
<br> 
<br> Mr Kernan approached Island street. 
<br> 
<br> Times of the troubles. Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those reminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington. When you look back on it all now in a kind of retrospective arrangement. Gaming at Daly's. No cardsharping then. One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger. Somewhere here Lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr. Stables behind Moira house. 
<br> 
<br> Damn good gin that was. 
<br> 
<br> Fine dashing young nobleman. Good stock, of course. That ruffian, that sham squire, with his violet gloves, gave him away. Course they were on the wrong side. They rose in dark and evil days. Fine poem that is: Ingram. They were gentlemen. Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly. Masterly rendition. 
<br> 
<br> At the siege of Ross did my father fall. 
<br> 
<br> A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping, leaping in their, in their saddles. Frockcoats. Cream sunshades. 
<br> 
<br> Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily. 
<br> 
<br> His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair. Damn it! What a pity! 
<br> 
<br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br> 
<br> Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary's fingers prove a timedulled chain. Dust webbed the window and the showtrays. Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails. Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones. 
<br> 
<br> Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil lights shining in the darkness. Where fallen archangels flung the stars of their brows. Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest them. 
<br> 
<br> She dances in a foul gloom where gum burns with garlic. A sailorman, rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her. A long and seafed silent rut. She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg. 
<br> 
<br> Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it and held it at the point of his Moses' beard. Grandfather ape gloating on a stolen hoard. 
<br> 
<br> And you who wrest old images from the burial earth! The brainsick words of sophists: Antisthenes. A lore of drugs. Orient and immortal wheat standing from everlasting to everlasting. 
<br> 
<br> Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded umbrella, one with a midwife's bag in which eleven cockles rolled. 
<br> 
<br> The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse urged Stephen to be on. Beingless beings. Stop! Throb always without you and the throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I between them. Where? Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I. Shatter them, one and both. But stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me you who can. Bawd and butcher, were the words. I say! Not yet awhile. A look around. 
<br> 
<br> Yes, quite true. Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time. You say right, sir. A Monday morning, 'twas so, indeed. 
<br> 
<br> Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against his shoulderblade. In Clohissey's window a faded 1860 print of Heenan boxing Sayers held his eye. Staring backers with square hats stood round the roped prizering. The heavyweights in light loincloths proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists. And they are throbbing: heroes' hearts. 
<br> 
<br> He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart. 
<br> 
<br> -- Twopence each, the huckster said. Four for sixpence. 
<br> 
<br> Tattered pages. The Irish Beekeeper. Life and Miracles of the Curé of Ars. Pocket Guide to Killarney. 
<br> 
<br> I might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes. Stephano Dedalo, alumno optimo, palmam ferenti. 
<br> 
<br> Father Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet of Donnycarney, murmuring vespers. 
<br> 
<br> Binding too good probably, what is this? Eighth and ninth book of Moses. Secret of all secrets. Seal of King David. Thumbed pages: read and read. Who has passed here before me? How to soften chapped hands. Recipe for white wine vinegar. How to win a woman's love. For me this. Say the following talisman three times with hands folded: 
<br> 
<br> -- Se et yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen. 
<br> 
<br> Who wrote this? Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter Salanka to all true believers divulged. As good as any other abbot's charms, as mumbling Joachim's. Down, baldynoddle, or we'll wool your wool. 
<br> 
<br> -- What are you doing here, Stephen. 
<br> 
<br> Dilly's high shoulders and shabby dress. 
<br> 
<br> Shut the book quick. Don't let see. 
<br> 
<br> -- What are you doing? Stephen said. 
<br> 
<br> A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides. It glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots. I told her of Paris. Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a pinchbeck bracelet, Dan Kelly's token. Nebrakada femininum. 
<br> 
<br> -- What have you there? Stephen asked. 
<br> 
<br> -- I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing nervously. Is it any good? 
<br> 
<br> My eyes they say she has. Do others see me so? Quick, far and daring. Shadow of my mind. 
<br> 
<br> He took the coverless book from her hand. Chardenal's French primer. 
<br> 
<br> -- What did you buy that for? he asked. To learn French? 
<br> 
<br> She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips. 
<br> 
<br> Show no surprise. Quite natural. 
<br> 
<br> -- Here, Stephen said. It's all right. Mind Maggy doesn't pawn it on you. I suppose all my books are gone. 
<br> 
<br> -- Some, Dilly said. We had to. 
<br> 
<br> She is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She will drown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me, my heart, my soul. Salt green death. 
<br> 
<br> We. 
<br> 
<br> Agenbite of inwit. Inwit's agenbite. 
<br> 
<br> Misery! Misery! 
<br> 
<br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br> 
<br> -- Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things? 
<br> 
<br> -- Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping. 
<br> 
<br> They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter's. Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand. 
<br> 
<br> -- What's the best news? Mr Dedalus said. 
<br> 
<br> -- Why then not much, Father Cowley said. I'm barricaded up, Simon, with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance. 
<br> 
<br> -- Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Who is it? 
<br> 
<br> -- O, Father Cowley said. A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance. 
<br> 
<br> -- With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked. 
<br> 
<br> -- The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. Reuben of that ilk. I'm just waiting for Ben Dollard. He's going to say a word to Long John to get him to take those two men off. All I want is a little time. 
<br> 
<br> He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck. 
<br> 
<br> -- I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Poor old bockedy Ben! He's always doing a good turn for someone. Hold hard! 
<br> 
<br> He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant. 
<br> 
<br> -- There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets. 
<br> 
<br> Ben Dollard's loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. He came towards them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails. 
<br> 
<br> As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted: 
<br> 
<br> -- Hold that fellow with the bad trousers. 
<br> 
<br> -- Hold him now, Ben Dollard said. 
<br> 
<br> Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard's figure. Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly: 
<br> 
<br> -- That's a pretty garment, isn't it, for a summer's day? 
<br> 
<br> -- Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw. 
<br> 
<br> He stood beside them beaming on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying: 
<br> 
<br> -- They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow. 
<br> 
<br> -- Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. Thanks be to God he's not paid yet. 
<br> 
<br> -- And how is that basso profondo, Benjamin? Father Cowley asked. 
<br> 
<br> Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glasseyed, strode past the Kildare street club. 
<br> 
<br> Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter's mouth, gave forth a deep note. 
<br> 
<br> -- Aw! he said. 
<br> 
<br> -- That's the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone. 
<br> 
<br> -- What about that? Ben Dollard said. Not too dusty? What? He turned to both. 
<br> 
<br> -- That'll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also. 
<br> 
<br> The reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old Chapterhouse of saint Mary's abbey past James and Charles Kennedy's, rectifiers, attended by Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the Ford of Hurdles. 
<br> 
<br> Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air. 
<br> 
<br> -- Come along with me to the subsheriff's office, he said. I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff. He's a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun. He's well worth seeing, mind you. Come along. I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don't... wait awhile... We're on the right lay, Bob, believe you me. 
<br> 
<br> -- For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously. 
<br> 
<br> Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright. 
<br> 
<br> -- What few days? he boomed. Hasn't your landlord distrained for rent? 
<br> 
<br> -- He has, Father Cowley said. 
<br> 
<br> -- Then our friend's writ is not worth the paper it's printed on, Ben Dollard said. The landlord has the prior claim. I gave him all the particulars. 29 Windsor avenue. Love is the name? 
<br> 
<br> -- That's right, Father Cowley said. The reverend Mr Love. He's a minister in the country somewhere. But are you sure of that? 
<br> 
<br> -- You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts. 
<br> 
<br> He led Father Cowley boldly forward linked to his bulk. 
<br> 
<br> -- Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them. 
<br> 
<br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br> 
<br> -- The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out of the Castleyard gate. 
<br> 
<br> The policeman touched his forehead. 
<br> 
<br> -- God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily. 
<br> 
<br> He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street. 
<br> 
<br> Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head, appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel. 
<br> 
<br> Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard. I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him. 
<br> 
<br> -- You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward. 
<br> 
<br> -- Boyd? Martin Cunningham said shortly. Touch me not. 
<br> 
<br> John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork hill. 
<br> 
<br> On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending. 
<br> 
<br> The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street. 
<br> 
<br> -- Look here Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the Mail office. I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings. 
<br> 
<br> -- Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. And put down the five shillings too. 
<br> 
<br> -- Without a second word either, Mr Power said. 
<br> 
<br> -- Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added. 
<br> 
<br> John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes. 
<br> 
<br> -- I'll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted elegantly. 
<br> 
<br> They went down Parliament street. 
<br> 
<br> -- There's Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh's. 
<br> 
<br> -- Righto, Martin Cunningham said. Here goes. 
<br> 
<br> Outside la Maison Claire Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney's brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties. 
<br> 
<br> John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit who walked uncertainly with hasty steps past Micky Anderson's watches. 
<br> 
<br> -- The assistant town clerk's corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power. 
<br> 
<br> They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh's winerooms. The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate. Martin Cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance. 
<br> 
<br> -- And Long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life. 
<br> 
<br> The tall form of Long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood. 
<br> 
<br> -- Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted. 
<br> 
<br> Long John Fanning made no way for them. He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces. 
<br> 
<br> -- Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he said, with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk. 
<br> 
<br> Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly, about their damned Irish language. Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber. And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing locum tenens for him. Damned Irish language, of our forefathers. 
<br> 
<br> Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips. 
<br> 
<br> Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace. 
<br> 
<br> -- What Dignam was that? Long John Fanning asked. 
<br> 
<br> Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot. 
<br> 
<br> -- O, my corns! he said plaintively. Come upstairs for goodness' sake till I sit down somewhere. Uff! Ooo! Mind! 
<br> 
<br> Testily he made room for himself beside Long John Fanning's flank and passed in and up the stairs. 
<br> 
<br> -- Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff. I don't think you knew him or perhaps you did, though. 
<br> 
<br> With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in. 
<br> 
<br> -- Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of Long John Fanning ascending towards Long John Fanning in the mirror. 
<br> 
<br> -- Rather lowsized, Dignam of Menton's office that was, Martin Cunningham said. 
<br> 
<br> Long John Fanning could not remember him. 
<br> 
<br> Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air. 
<br> 
<br> -- What's that? Martin Cunningham said. 
<br> 
<br> All turned where they stood; John Wyse Nolan came down again. From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders. 
<br> 
<br> -- What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase. 
<br> 
<br> -- The lord lieutenant general and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot. 
<br> 
<br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br> 
<br> As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his panama to Haines. 
<br> 
<br> -- Parnell's brother. There in the corner. 
<br> 
<br> They chose a small table near the window opposite a long-faced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard. 
<br> 
<br> -- Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat. 
<br> 
<br> -- Yes, Mulligan said. That's John Howard, his brother, our city marshal. 
<br> 
<br> John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested. 
<br> 
<br> An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner. 
<br> 
<br> -- I'll take a mélange, Haines said to the waitress. 
<br> 
<br> -- Two mélanges, Buck Mulligan said. And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well. 
<br> 
<br> When she had gone he said, laughing: 
<br> 
<br> -- We call it D. B. C. because they have damn bad cakes. O, but you missed Dedalus on Hamlet. 
<br> 
<br> Haines opened his newbought book. 
<br> 
<br> -- I'm sorry, he said. Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance. 
<br> 
<br> The onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street: 
<br> 
<br> -- England expects... 
<br> 
<br> Buck Mulligan's primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter. 
<br> 
<br> -- You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance. Wandering &amp;Aelig;ngus I call him. 
<br> 
<br> -- I am sure he has an idée fixe, Haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be. Such persons always have. 
<br> 
<br> Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely. 
<br> 
<br> -- They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. He will never capture the Attic note. The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white death and the ruddy birth. That is his tragedy. He can never be a poet. The joy of creation. 
<br> 
<br> -- Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. I see. I tackled him this morning on belief. There was something on his mind, I saw. It's rather interesting because Professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that. 
<br> 
<br> Buck Mulligan's watchful eyes saw the waitress come. He helped her to unload her tray. 
<br> 
<br> -- He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid the cheerful cups. The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution. Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. Does he write anything for your movement? 
<br> 
<br> He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream. Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith. He bit off a soft piece hungrily. 
<br> 
<br> -- Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. He is going to write something in ten years. 
<br> 
<br> -- Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon. Still, I shouldn't wonder if he did after all. 
<br> 
<br> He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup. 
<br> 
<br> -- This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance. I don't want to be imposed on. 
<br> 
<br> Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past Benson's ferry, and by the three-masted schooner Rosevean from Bridgwater with bricks. 
<br> 
<br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br> 
<br> Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell's yard. Behind him Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith's house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square. Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College Park. 
<br> 
<br> Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner's cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling. 
<br> 
<br> At the corner of Wilde's he halted, frowned at Elijah's name announced on the Metropolitan Hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke's lawn. His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. With ratsteeth bared he muttered: 
<br> 
<br> -- Coactus volui. 
<br> 
<br> He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word. 
<br> 
<br> As he strode past Mr Bloom's dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having buffeted a thewless body. The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form. 
<br> 
<br> -- God's curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You're blinder nor I am, you bitch's bastard! 
<br> 
<br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br> 
<br> Opposite Ruggy O'Donohoe's Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound and half of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling. It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney's. And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruit cake jawing the whole blooming time and sighing. 
<br> 
<br> After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, court dress milliner, stopped him. He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting up their props. From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently. Myler Keogh, Dublin's pet lamb, will meet sergeant-major Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of fifty sovereigns, God, that'd be a good pucking match to see. Myler Keogh, that's the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. Two bar entrance, soldiers half price. I could easy do a bunk on ma. Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned. That's me in mourning. When is it? May the twenty-second. Sure, the blooming thing is all over. He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up. Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out. 
<br> 
<br> Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons. One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man. But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all. 
<br> 
<br> In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff's mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time. 
<br> 
<br> No Sandymount tram. 
<br> 
<br> Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it. He met schoolboys with satchels. I'm not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice I'm in mourning? Uncle Barney said he'd get it into the paper tonight. Then they'll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa's name. 
<br> 
<br> His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye. The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs. 
<br> 
<br> Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking. How was that? The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney's for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt. Never see him again. Death, that is. Pa is dead. My father is dead. He told me to be a good son to ma. I couldn't hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better. Poor pa. That was Mr Dignam, my father. I hope he is in purgatory now because he went to confession to father Conroy on Saturday night. 
<br> 
<br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br> 
<br> William Humble, earl of Dudley, and Lady Dudley, accompanied by lieutenantcolonel Hesseltine, drove out after luncheon from the viceregal lodge. In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs Paget, Miss de Courcy and the honourable Gerald Ward, A. D. C. in attendance. 
<br> 
<br> The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix Park saluted by obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern quays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the metropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar. Between Queen's and Whitworth bridges Lord Dudley's viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley White, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran Quay outside Mrs M. E. White's, the pawnbroker's, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costsbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office of Reuben J. Dodd, solicitor, agent for the Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by King's windows smiled credulously on the representative of His Majesty. From its sluice in Wood quay wall under Tom Devan's office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of liquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond Hotel, gold by bronze, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head watched and admired. On Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse for the subsheriff's office, stood still in midstreet and brought his hat low. His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus' greeting. From Cahill's corner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M. A., made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M'Coy, taking leave of each other, watched the carriages go by. Passing by Roger Greene's office and Dollard's big red printing house Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby's cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn't see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring's big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant. Beyond Lundy Foot's from the shaded door of Kavanagh's winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed Micky Anderson's all times ticking watches and Henry and James's wax smartsuited freshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, dernier cri James. Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade. Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her. A charming soubrette, great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt, smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H. G. Hesseltine and also upon the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. From the window of the D. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently. In Fownes's street, Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal's first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg of King Billy's horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the tidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C., agreeably surprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby's corner a jaded white flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him, E. L. Y.'S., while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite Pigott's music warerooms Mr Denis J. Maginni professor of dancing &amp;c, gaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved. By the provost's wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of My girl's a Yorkshire girl. 
<br> 
<br> Blazes Boylan presented to the leaders' skyblue frontlets and high action a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a suit of indigo serge. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute but he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and the red flower between his lips. As they drove along Nassau street His Excellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of music which was being discoursed in College park. Unseen brazen highland laddies blared and drumthumped after the cortége: 
<br> 
<br> But though she's a factory lass 
<br> And wears no fancy clothes. 
<br> Baraabum. 
<br> Yet I've a sort of a 
<br> Yorkshire relish for 
<br> My little Yorkshire rose. 
<br> Baraabum.
<br> Thither of the wall the quartermile flat handicappers, M. C. Green, H. Thrift, T. M. Patey, C. Scaife, J. B. Jeffs, G. N. Morphy, F. Stevenson, C. Adderly, and W. C. Huggard started in pursuit. Striding past Finn's hotel, Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell stared through a fierce eyeglass across the carriages at the head of Mr E. M. Solomons in the window of the Austro-Hungarian viceconsulate. Deep in Leinster street, by Trinity's postern, a loyal king's man, Horn-blower, touched his tallyho cap. As the glossy horses pranced by Merrion square Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes being given to the gent with the topper and raised also his new black cap with fingers greased by porksteak paper. His collar too sprang up. The viceroy, on his way to inaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds for Mercer's hospital, drove with his following towards Lower Mount street. He passed a blind stripling Opposite Broadbent's. In Lower Mount street a pedestrian in a brown macintosh, eating dry bread, passed swiftly and unscathed across the viceroy's path. At the Royal Canal bridge, from his hoarding, Mr Eugene Stratton, his blub lips agrin, bade all comers welcome to Pembroke township. At Haddington road corner two sanded women halted themselves, an umbrella and a bag in which eleven cockles rolled to view with wonder the lord mayor and lady mayoress without his golden chain. On Northumberland and Landsdowne roads His Excellency acknowledged punctually salutes from rare male walkers, the salute of two small schoolboys at the garden gate of the house said to have been admired by the late queen when visiting the Irish capital with her husband, the prince consort, in 1849, and the salute of Almidano Artifoni's sturdy trousers swallowed by a closing door. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 耶稣会会长，十分可敬的约翰·康米[1]边迈下神父住宅的台阶，边把光滑的怀表揣回内兜。差五分三点。还来得及，正好走到阿坦[2]。那个男孩儿姓什么来着?迪格纳穆。对。着实恰当而正确[3]。应该去见见斯旺修士[4]。还有一封坎宁翰[5]先生的来信呢。是啊，尽可能满足他的要求吧。这是位善良而能干的天主教徒。布教的时候能派上用场。
<br> 
<br> 一个独腿水手，架着双拐，无精打采地一步一挪地往前悠荡，嘴里哼唱着什么曲调。他悠荡到仁爱会修女院前面，蓦地停了下来，朝着耶稣会这位十分可敬的约翰·康米伸过一顶鸭舌帽，求他施舍。康米神父在阳光下祝福了他，因为神父知道自己的钱包里只有一克朗银币。
<br> 
<br> 康米神父横过马路，跨过蒙乔伊广场。他想了一下被炮弹炸断了腿的士兵和水手怎样在贫民救济所里结束余生的事，又想起红衣主教沃尔西的话：“如果我用为国王效劳的热诚来侍奉天主，他也不会在我垂老之年抛弃我。”[6]他沿着树荫，走在闪烁着阳光的树叶底下；议会议员戴维·希伊先生的太太[7]迎面而来。
<br> 
<br> “我很好，真的，神父。您呢，神父?”
<br> 
<br> 康米神父确实非常健康。他也许会到巴克斯顿[8]去洗洗矿泉澡。她的公子们在贝尔维迪尔[9]念得蛮好吧?是吗?康米神父听到这情况，的确很高兴。希伊先生本人呢?还在伦敦。议会仍在开会，可不是嘛。多好的天气啊，真让人心旷神怡。是啊，伯纳德·沃恩[10]神父极可能会再来讲一次道。啊，可不，了不起的成功。的确是位奇才。
<br> 
<br> 康米神父看到议会议员戴维·希伊先生的太太显得那么健康，高兴极了，他恳请她代为向议会议员戴维·希伊先生致意。是的，他准登门去拜访。
<br> 
<br> “那么，再见吧，希伊太太。”
<br> 
<br> 康米神父脱下大礼帽告别，朝着她面纱上那些在阳光下闪着墨光的乌珠芜尔一笑。一边走开一边又漾出微笑。他晓得自己曾用槟榔果膏把牙刷得干干净净。
<br> 
<br> 康米神父踱着，边走边泛出微笑，因为他记起伯纳德·沃恩神父那逗乐儿的眼神和带伦敦土腔的口音。
<br> 
<br> “彼拉多!你咋不赶走那些起哄的家伙？”[11]
<br> 
<br> 不管怎么说，他是个热心肠的人。这一点不假。以他独特的方式，确实做过不少好事。这是毫无疑问的。他说他热爱爱尔兰，也热爱爱尔兰人。谁能相信他还出身于世家呢?是威尔士人吧?
<br> 
<br> 哦，可别忘了。那封给管辖教区的神父的信。
<br> 
<br> 在蒙乔伊广场的角落里，康米神父拦住三个小学童。对，他们是贝尔维迪尔的学生。呃，班次很低。他们在学校里都是好学生吗?哦，那就好极啦。那么，他叫什么名字呢?杰克·索恩。他叫什么?杰尔[12]·加拉赫。另一个小不点儿呢?他的名字叫布鲁尼·莱纳姆。哦，起了个多么好的名字。
<br> 
<br> 康米神父从前胸掏出一封信来，递给少年布鲁尼·莱纳姆，并指了指菲茨吉本街拐角处的红色邮筒。
<br> 
<br> “可是留点儿神，别把你自个儿也投进邮筒里去，小不点儿，”他说。
<br> 
<br> 孩子们的六只眼睛盯着康米神父，大声笑了起来:
<br> 
<br> “哦，您哪。”
<br> 
<br> “喏，让我瞧瞧你会不会投邮，”康米神父说。
<br> 
<br> 少年布鲁尼·莱纳姆跑到了马路对面，将康米神父那封写给管辖教区神父的信塞进红艳艳的邮筒口里。康米神父泛着微笑，点了点头。然后又笑了笑，就沿着蒙乔伊广场向东踱去。
<br> 
<br> 舞蹈等课程的教师丹尼斯·杰·马金尼[13]先生头戴丝质大礼帽，身穿滚着绸边的暗蓝灰色长礼服，系着雪白的蝴蝶结，下面是淡紫色紧腿裤;戴着鲜黄色手套，脚登尖头漆皮靴。他举止端庄地走着，来到迪格纳穆庭院的角上。这时，马克斯韦尔夫人擦身而过，他赶紧毕恭毕敬地闪到边石上去。
<br> 
<br> 那不是麦吉尼斯太太[14]吗?
<br> 
<br> 满头银发、仪表堂堂的麦吉尼斯太太在对面的人行道上款款而行。她朝康米神父点头致意。康米神父含笑施礼。她近来可好?
<br> 
<br> 夫人风度忧雅，颇有点儿像苏格兰女王玛丽[15]。想想看，她竟然是个当铺老板娘!哟，真是的!这么一派……该怎么说呢?……这么一派女王风度。
<br> 
<br> 康米神父沿着大查尔斯街前行，朝左侧那紧闭着门的自由教会[16]瞟了一眼。可敬的文学士T·R·格林将(按照神的旨意)[17]布道。他们称他作教区牧师。他呢，认为讲上几句儿乃是义不容辞的[18]。然而，得对他们宽大为怀。不可克服的愚昧。他们毕竟也是根据自己的见解行事的啊。
<br> 
<br> 康米神父拐了弯，沿着北环路踱去。奇怪，这样一条重要的通衢大道，竟然没铺设电车路。肯定应该铺设。
<br> 
<br> 一样背着书包的学童从里奇蒙大街那边跨过马路而来。个个扬起肮里肮脏的便帽。康米神父一次又一次慈祥地朝他们还礼。这都是些公教弟兄会[19]的孩子们。
<br> 
<br> 康米神父一路走着，闻到右侧飘来一股烟香。波特兰横街的圣约瑟教堂。那是给贞节的老妪们开设的。[20]神父冲着圣体[21]摘下帽子。她们固然操守高尚，只是，有时脾气挺坏。
<br> 
<br> 来到奥尔德勃勒邸第附近，康米神父想起那位挥金如土的贵族。而今，这里改成了公事房还是什么的。[22]
<br> 
<br> 康米神父开始开始顺着北滩路走去，站在自己那爿商号门口的威廉·加拉赫先生朝他施礼。康米神父向威廉·加拉赫先生还礼，并嗅到了成条的腌猪肋骨肉和桶里装得满满的冰镇黄油的气味。他走边葛洛根烟草铺，店前斜靠着一块块张贴新闻的告示板，报道发生在纽约的一桩惨案[23]。在美国，这类事件层出不穷。倒楣的人们毫无准备地就那么送了命。不过，彻底悔罪也能获得赦免[24]。
<br> 
<br> 康米神父走边丹尼尔·伯金的酒馆儿。两个没找到活儿干的男人在闲倚着窗口消磨时光。他们向他行礼，他也还了礼。
<br> 
<br> 康米神父走过H·J·奥尼尔殡仪馆。科尼·凯莱赫正一边嚼着一片枯草，一边在流水帐簿上划算着。一个巡逻的警察向康米神父致敬，康米神父也回敬了一下。走边尤克斯泰特猪肉店，康米神父瞧见里面整整齐齐地摆着黑白红色的猪肉香肠，像是弯曲的管子。在查尔维尔林荫道的树底下，康米神父瞅见一艘泥炭船，一匹拉纤的马低垂着脑袋，头戴脏草帽的船老大坐在船中央，抽着烟，目不转睛地望着头顶上一根白杨树枝。真是一派田园诗意。康米神父琢磨着造物主的旨意：让沼泽里产生泥炭，供人们来挖掘，运到城市和村庄。于是，穷人家里就生得起火了。
<br> 
<br> 来到纽科门桥上，上加德纳街圣方济各·沙勿略教堂的这位十分可敬的耶稣会会长约翰·康米跨上一辆驶往郊外的电车。
<br> 
<br> 一辆驶往市内的电车在纽科门桥这一站停住了。圣阿加莎教堂的本堂神父、至尊的尼古拉斯·达德利下了车。
<br> 
<br> 康米神父是由于讨厌徒步跋涉泥岛[25]那段脏路，才在纽科门桥搭乘这趟驶往郊外的电车的。
<br> 
<br> 康米神父在电车的一角落座。他仔细地把一张蓝色车票掖在肥大的小山羊皮手套的扣眼间;而四先令和一枚六便士以及五枚一便士[26]则从他的另一只戴了小山羊皮手套的巴掌上，斜着滑进他的钱包。当电车从爬满常春藤的教堂前驰过的时候，他想道：通常总是刚一粗心大意地扔掉车票，查票的就来了。康米神父觉得，就如此短暂而便宜的旅途而言，车上的乘客未免过于一本正经了。康米神父喜欢过得既愉快而又事事得体。
<br> 
<br> 这是个宁静的日子。坐在康米神父对面那位戴眼镜的绅士解释完了什么，朝下望去。康米神父猜想，那准是他的妻子。
<br> 
<br> 一个小哈欠使那位戴眼镜的绅士的妻子启开了口。她举起戴着手套的小拳头，十分文雅地打了个哈欠，用戴了手套的小拳头轻轻碰了碰启开的嘴，甜甜地泛出一丝微笑。
<br> 
<br> 康米神父觉察出车厢里散发着她那香水的芬芳。他还发觉，挨着她另一边的一个男子局促不安地坐在座位的边沿上。[27]
<br> 
<br> 康米神父曾经在祭坛栏杆边上吃力地把圣体送进一个动作拙笨的老人嘴里。那人患有摇头症。
<br> 
<br> 电车在安斯利桥停了下来。正要开动时，一个老妪抽冷子从她的座位上站了起来。她要下车。售票员拽了一下铃绳，叫刹车，好让她下去。她挎着篮子，提了网兜，踱出车厢。康米神父望见售票员将她连篮子带网兜扶下车去。康米神父思忖，她那一便士车钱都差点儿坐过了头。从这一点来看，她是那种善良人中间的一个，你得一再告诉她们说，己经被赦免了：“祝福你，我的孩子，为我祈祷吧。”[28]然而她们在生活中有那么多忧虑，那么多操心的事儿，可怜的人们。
<br> 
<br> 广告牌上的尤金·斯特拉顿[29]先生咧着黑人的厚嘴唇，朝康米神父作出一副怪相。
<br> 
<br> 康米神父想到黑、棕、黄色人种的灵魂啦，他所做的有关耶稣会的圣彼得·克莱佛尔[30]和非洲传教事业的宣讲啦，传播信仰啦，还有那数百万黑、棕、黄色的灵魂。当大限像夜里的小偷那样忽然来到[31]时，他们却尚未接受洗礼。康米神父认为，那位比利时耶稣会会士所著《选民之人数》[32]一书中的主张，还是入情入理的。那数百万人的灵魂是天主照自己的形象创造[33]的。然而他们不曾(按照神的旨意[34])获得信仰。但他们毕竟是天主的生灵，是天主所创造的。依康米神父看来，让他们统统沉沦未免太可惜了，而且也可以说是一种浪费。
<br> 
<br> 康米神父在豪斯路那一站下了车。售票员向他致敬，他也还了礼。
<br> 
<br> 马拉海德路一片寂静。这条路和它的名字很合康米神父的心意。马拉海德喜洋洋，庆祝钟声响啊响。[35]马拉海德的塔尔伯特勋爵，马拉海德和毗邻海域世袭海军司令的直系继承者。紧接着，征召令下来了。在同一天，她从处女一变而为妻子和遗孀[36]。那是世风古朴的半月，乡区里一片欢快，是效忠爵爷领地的古老时代。
<br> 
<br> 康米神父边走边思索着自己所著的那本小书《爵爷领地的古老时代》[37]以及另一本值得一写的书，关于耶稣会修道院以及莫尔斯沃思勋爵之女——第一代贝尔弗迪尔伯爵夫人玛丽·罗奇福特[38]。
<br> 
<br> 一个青春已逝、神色倦怠的夫人，沿着艾乃水湖[39]畔踽踽独行。第一代贝尔弗迪尔伯爵夫人神色倦怠地在苍茫暮色中仿徨。当一只水獭跃进水里时，她也木然无所动。谁晓得实情呢?正在吃醋的贝尔弗迪尔爵爷不可能，听她忏悔的神父也不可能知道她曾否与小叔子完全通奸，曾否被他往自己那女性天然器官内射精[40]吧?按照妇女的常情，倘若她没有完全犯罪，她只须不痛不痒地忏悔一番。知道实情的，只有天主、她本人以及他——她那位小叔子。
<br> 
<br> 康米神父想到了那种暴虐的纵欲，不管怎么说，为了人类在地球上繁衍生息，那是不可或缺的。也想到了我们的所作所为迥乎不同于天主。
<br> 
<br> 唐约翰[4]·康米边走路迫在往昔的岁月里徘徊。在那儿，他以慈悲为怀，备受尊重。他把人们所忏悔的桩桩隐秘都铭记在心头;在一间天花板上吊着累累果实、用蜜蜡打磨的客厅里，他以笑脸迎迓贵人们一张张笑容可掬的脸。新郎和新娘的手，贵族和贵族，都通过唐约翰·康米，将掌心叠放在一起了。
<br> 
<br> 这是令人心旷神怡的日子。
<br> 
<br> 隔着教堂墓地的停柩门，康米神父望到一畦畦的卷心菜，它们摊开宽绰的下叶向他行着屈膝礼。天空，一小簇白云彩映入眼帘，正徐徐随风飘下。法国人管这叫毛茸茸的[42]。这个词儿恰当而又朴实。
<br> 
<br> 康米神父边诵读日课[43]，边眺望拉思科非[44]上空那簇羊毛般的云彩。他那穿着薄短袜的脚脖子被克朗戈伍斯田野里的残梗乱茬刺得痒痒的。他一面诵着晚课，一面倾听分班排游戏的学童们的喊叫声——稚嫩的嗓音划破傍晚的静谧。当年他曾经当过他们的校长。他管理得很宽厚。[45]
<br> 
<br> 康米神父脱掉手套，掏出红边的《圣教日课》。一片象牙书签标示着该读哪一页。
<br> 
<br> 九时课[46]。按说应该在午饭前诵读的。可是马克斯韦尔夫人来了。
<br> 
<br> 康米神父悄悄地诵毕《天主经》和《圣母经》[47]，在胸前面个十字:天主啊，求你快快拯救我![48]
<br> 
<br> 他安详地踱步，默诵着九时课，边走边诵，一直诵到心地纯洁的人有福了[49]的第Res[50]节：
<br> 
<br> 你法律的中心乃是真理;
<br> 
<br> 你一切公正的诫律永远长存![51]
<br> 
<br> 一个涨红了脸的小伙子[52]从篱笆缝隙间钻了出来。 跟着又钻出一个年轻姑娘，手里握着一束摇曳不停的野雏菊。小伙子突然举帽行了个礼，年轻姑娘赶忙弯下腰去，缓慢仔细地将巴在她那轻飘飘的裙子上的一截小树枝摘掉。
<br> 
<br> 康米神父庄重地祝福了他们俩，然后翻开薄薄的一页《圣教日课》：Sin[53]。
<br> 
<br> 有权势的人无故逼迫我，但我尊重你的法律。[54]
<br> 
<br> * * *
<br> 
<br> 科尼·凯莱赫合上他那本长方形的流水帐簿，用疲惫的目光扫了扫那宛如哨兵般立在角落里的松木棺材盖儿一眼。他挺直了身子，走到棺材盖儿跟前，以它的一角为轴心，旋转了一下，端详着它的形状和铜饰。他边嚼着那片干草，边放回棺材盖儿，来到门口。他在那儿把帽檐往下一拉，好让眼睛有个遮荫，然后倚着门框懒洋洋地朝外面望着。
<br> 
<br> 约翰·康米神父在纽科门桥上了驶往多利山的电车。
<br> 
<br> 科尼·凯莱赫交叉着那双穿了大皮靴子的大脚，帽檐拉得低低的，定睛望着，嘴里还咀嚼着那片干草。
<br> 
<br> 正在巡逻的丙五十七号警察停下脚步，跟他寒喧。
<br> 
<br> “今儿个天气不错，凯莱赫先生。”
<br> 
<br> “可不是嘛，”科尼·凯莱赫说。
<br> 
<br> “闷热得厉害，”警察说。
<br> 
<br> 科尼·凯莱赫一声不响地从嘴里啐出一口干草汁，它以弧形线飞了出去。就在这当儿，一只白晳的胳膊从埃克尔斯街上的一扇窗户里慷慨地丢出一枚硬币。[55]
<br> 
<br> “有什么最好的消息?”他问。
<br> 
<br> “昨儿晚上我看到了那个特别的聚会，”警察压低嗓门说。
<br> 
<br> * * *
<br> 
<br> 一个独腿水手架着丁字拐，在麦康内尔药房跟前拐了个弯，绕过拉白奥蒂的冰淇淋车，一颠一颠地进了埃克尔斯街。拉里·奥罗克[56]只穿了件衬衫站在门口，水手就朝着他毫不友善地吼叫：
<br> 
<br> 为了英国……
<br> 
<br> 他猛地往前悠荡了儿步，从凯蒂和布棣·迪达勒斯身边走过，并站住，吼了一声：
<br> 
<br> 为了家园和丽人。[57]
<br> 
<br> 从杰·杰·奥莫洛伊那张苍白愁苦的脸可以知道，兰伯特先生正在库房里接见来客。
<br> 
<br> 一位胖太太停下来，从手提包里掏出一枚铜币，丢在伸到她跟前的便帽里。水手喃喃地表示谢意，愠怒地朝那些对他置之不理的窗户狠狠地盯了一眼，把脑袋一耷拉，又向前悠荡了四步。
<br> 
<br> 他停下来，怒冲冲地咆哮着：
<br> 
<br> 为了英国……
<br> 
<br> 两个打赤脚的顽童嚼着长长的甘草根，在他身旁站下来，嘴里淌着黄糊糊的涎水，呆呆望着他那残肢。
<br> 
<br> 他使劲朝前悠荡了几步，停下来，冲着一扇窗户扬起头，用拖长的深沉嗓音吼道：
<br> 
<br> 为了家园和丽人。
<br> 
<br> 窗内发出小鸟鸣啭般的圆润快活的口哨声，持续了一两节才止住。窗帘拉开了。一张写着“房间出租，自备家具”字样的牌子打窗框上滑落下去。窗口露出一只丰腴赤裸、乐善好施的胳膊，是从连着衬裙的白色乳搭那绷得紧紧的吊带间伸出的。一只女人[58]的手隔着地下室前的栏杆掷出一枚硬币。它落在人行道上了。
<br> 
<br> 一个顽童朝这枚硬币跑去，拾了起来，把它投进这位歌手的便帽时，嘴里说着：
<br> 
<br> “喏，大叔。”
<br> 
<br> * * *
<br> 
<br> 凯蒂和布棣·迪达勒斯推开门，走进那狭窄、蒸气弥漫的厨房。
<br> 
<br> “你把书当出去了吗?”布棣问。
<br> 
<br> 玛吉站在铁灶[59]跟前，两次用搅锅的棍儿把一团发灰的什么许进冒泡的肥皂水里，然后擦了擦前额。
<br> 
<br> “他们一个便士也不给，”她说。
<br> 
<br> 康米神父走边克朗戈伍斯田野，他那双穿着薄短袜的脚脖子被残茬扎得痒痒的。
<br> 
<br> “你到哪家去试的?”布棣问。
<br> 
<br> “麦吉尼斯当铺。”
<br> 
<br> 布棣跺了跺脚，把书包往桌上一惯。
<br> 
<br> “别自以为了不起，叫她遭殃去吧!”她嚷道。
<br> 
<br> 凯蒂走到铁灶跟前，眯起眼睛凝视着。
<br> 
<br> “锅里是什么呀?”她问。
<br> 
<br> “衬衫，”玛吉说。
<br> 
<br> 布棣气恼地嚷道：
<br> 
<br> “天哪!难道咱们什么吃的也没有了吗?”
<br> 
<br> 凯蒂用自己的脏裙子垫着手，掀开汤锅的盖儿问：
<br> 
<br> “这里面是什么?”
<br> 
<br> 锅里喷出的一股热气就回答她了。
<br> 
<br> “豌豆汤，”玛吉说。
<br> 
<br> “你打哪儿弄来的?”凯蒂问。
<br> 
<br> “玛丽·帕特里克修女那儿，”玛吉说。
<br> 
<br> 打杂的摇了一下铃。
<br> 
<br> 叮啷啷!
<br> 
<br> 布棣在桌前落座，饿着肚子说：“端到这儿来!”
<br> 
<br> 玛吉把稠糊糊的汤从锅里倒进了碗。坐在布棣对面的凯蒂边用指尖将面包渣塞进嘴里，边安详地说：
<br> 
<br> “咱们有这么多吃的就蛮好了。迪丽哪儿去啦?”
<br> 
<br> “接父亲去了，”玛吉说。
<br> 
<br> 布棣边把面包大块儿大块儿地掰到黄汤里，边饶上一句：
<br> 
<br> “我们不在天上的父亲……”[60]
<br> 
<br> 玛吉过往凯蒂的碗里倒黄汤，边嚷道：
<br> 
<br> “布棣!不许这么胡说八道!”
<br> 
<br> 一叶小舟——揉成一团丢掉的“以利亚来了”[61]，浮在利菲河上，顺流而下。穿过环道桥[62]，冲出桥墩周围翻滚的激流，绕过船身和锚链，从海关旧船坞与乔冶码头之间向东漂去。
<br>

<br> 
<br> 桑顿鲜花水果店的金发姑娘正往柳条筐里铺着窸窣作响的纤丝。布莱泽斯·博伊兰递给她一只裹在粉红色薄绉纸里的瓶子以及一个小罐子。
<br> 
<br> “把这些先放进去，好吗?”他说。
<br> 
<br> “好的，先生，”金发姑娘说，“上面放水果。”
<br> 
<br> “行，这样挺好，”布莱泽斯·博伊兰说。
<br> 
<br> 她把圆滚滚的梨头尾交错地码得整整齐齐，还在夹缝儿里撂上羞红了脸的熟桃。
<br> 
<br> 布莱泽斯·博伊兰脚上登着棕黄色新皮鞋，在果香扑鼻的店堂里踱来踱去，拿起那鲜嫩、多汁、带褶纹的水果，又拿起肥大、红艳艳的西红柿，嗅了嗅。
<br> 
<br> 头戴白色高帽的H·E·L·Y'S[63]从他面前列队而行;穿过坦吉尔巷，朝着目的地吃力地走去。
<br> 
<br> 他从托在薄木片上的一簇草莓跟前蓦地掉过房来，由表兜里拽出一块金怀表，将表链抻直。
<br> 
<br> “你们可以搭电车送去吗?马上?”
<br> 
<br> 在商贾拱廊内，一个黑糊糊的背影正在翻看着小贩车上的书。[64]
<br> 
<br> “先生，管保给你送到。是在城里吗?”
<br> 
<br> “可不，”布莱泽斯·博伊兰说，“十分钟。”
<br> 
<br> 金发姑娘递给他标签和铅笔。
<br> 
<br> “先生，劳您驾写下地址好吗?”
<br> 
<br> 布莱泽斯·博伊兰在柜台上写好标签，朝她推过去。
<br> 
<br> “马上送去，可以吗?”他说，“是给一位病人的。”
<br> 
<br> “好的，先生。马上就送，先生。”
<br> 
<br> 布莱泽斯·博伊兰在裤兜里摆弄着钱，发出一片快乐的声响。
<br> 
<br> “要多少钱?”他问。
<br> 
<br> 金发姑娘用纤指数着水果。
<br> 
<br> 布莱泽斯·博伊兰朝她衬衫的敞口处望了一眼，小雏儿。他从高脚杯里拈起一朵红艳艳的麝香石竹。
<br> 
<br> “这是给我的吧?”他调情地问。
<br> 
<br> 金发姑娘斜瞟了他一眼，见他不惜花费地打扮，领带稍微歪斜的那副样子，不觉飞红了脸。
<br> 
<br> “是的，先生，”她说。
<br> 
<br> 她灵巧地弯下腰去，数了数圆滚滚的梨和羞红的桃子。
<br> 
<br> 布莱泽斯·博伊兰越发心荡神驰地瞅着她那衬衫敞口处，用牙齿叼着红花的茎，嘻笑着。
<br> 
<br> “可以用你的电话说句话儿吗?”他流里流气地问。

<br> 他隔着斯蒂芬的肩膀，凝视着哥尔德斯密斯[67]那疙疙瘩瘩的脑袋。
<br> 
<br> 两辆满载游客的马车徐徐经过，妇女们紧攥着扶手坐在前面。一张张苍白的脸。[68]男子的胳膊坦然地搂着女人矮小的身子。一行人把视线从三一学院移到爱尔兰银行那耸立着圆柱、大门紧闭的门厅。那里，鸽群正咕咕咕地叫着。
<br> 
<br> “像你这样年轻的时候，”[69]阿尔米达诺·阿尔蒂弗尼说，“我也曾这么想过。当时我确信这个世界简直像个猪圈。太糟糕啦。因为你这副嗓子……可以成为你的财源，明白吗?然而你在做着自我牺牲。”[70]
<br> 
<br> “不流血的牺牲，”[71]斯蒂芬笑眯眯地说。他攥着梣木手杖的中腰，缓慢地轻轻地来回摆动着。
<br> 
<br> “但愿如此，”[72]蓄着口髭的圆脸蛋儿愉快地说，“可是，我的话你也听听才好。考虑考虑吧。”[73]
<br> 
<br> 从印契科驰来的一辆电车，服从了格拉顿用严厉的石手[74]发出的停车信号。一群隶属于军乐队的苏格兰高原士兵从车上七零八落地下来了。
<br> 
<br> “我仔细想一想，”[75]斯蒂芬说，低头瞥了一眼笔挺的裤腿。
<br> 
<br> “你这话是当真的吧，呃?”[76]阿尔米达诺·阿尔蒂弗尼说。
<br> 
<br> 他用那厚实的手紧紧握住斯蒂芬的手。一双富于人情味的眼睛朝他好奇地凝视了一下，接着就转向一辆驰往多基的电车。
<br> 
<br> “来啦，”匆忙中，阿尔米达诺·阿尔蒂弗尼友善地说，“到我那儿去坐坐，再想想吧。再见，老弟。”[77]
<br> 
<br> “再见，大师，”斯蒂芬说，他腾出手来掀了掀帽子说，“谢谢您啦!”[78]
<br> 
<br> “客气什么?”阿尔米达诺·阿尔蒂弗尼说，“原谅我，呃?祝你健康!”[79]
<br> 
<br> 阿尔米达诺·阿尔蒂弗尼把乐谱卷成指挥棒形，打了打招呼，迈开结实耐穿的裤腿去赶搭那趟驶往多基的电车。他被卷进那群身着短裤、裸着膝盖的高原士兵——他们偷偷携带着乐器，正在乱哄哄地拥进三一学院的大门[80]——所以他白跑了一趟，招呼也白打了。
<br>

<br> 
<br> 邓恩小姐[81]把那本从卡佩尔大街图书馆借来的《白衣女》[82]藏在抽屉尽里边，将一张花哨的信纸卷进打字机。
<br> 
<br> 里面故弄玄虚的地方大多了。他爱上了那位玛莉恩没有呢?换
<br> 
<br> 上一本玛丽·塞西尔·海依[83]的吧。
<br> 
<br> 圆盘[84]顺着槽溜下去。晃了一阵才停住，朝他们飞上一眼：六。
<br> 
<br> 邓恩小姐把打字机键盘敲得咯嗒咯嗒地响着：
<br> 
<br> “一九0四年六月十六日。”
<br> 
<br> 五个头戴白色高帽的广告人来到莫尼彭尼商店的街角和还不曾竖立沃尔夫·托恩[85]雕像的石板之间，他们那H·E·L·Y’S的蜿蜒队形就掉转过来， 拖着沉重的脚步沿着原路走回去。
<br> 
<br> 随后，她定睛望着专门扮演轻佻风骚角色的漂亮女演员玛丽·肯德尔[86]的大幅海报，慵懒地倚在桌上，在杂记本上胡乱涂写几个十六和大写的字母S。 芥末色的头发。抹得花里胡哨的脸颊。她并不俊俏，对吗?瞧她捏着裙角那副样子!我倒想知道，那个人今晚到不到乐队去[87]。我要是能叫裁缝给我做一条苏西·内格尔那样的百褶裙该有多好。走起来多有气派。香农和划船俱乐部[88]里所有那些时髦人物眼睛简直都离不开她了。真希望他今天不要把我一直留到七点。
<br> 
<br> 电话铃在她耳边猛地响了起来。
<br> 
<br> “喂!对，先生。没有，先生。是的，先生。五点以后我给他们打电话。 只有那两封——一封寄到贝尔法斯特[89]，一封寄到利物浦。好的，先生。那么，如果您不回来，过六点我就可以走了吧。六点一刻。好，先生。二十七先令六。我会告诉他的。对，一镑七先令六。”
<br> 
<br> 她在一个信封上潦草地写下三个数字。
<br> 
<br> “博伊兰先生!喂!《体育报》那位先生来找过您。对，是利内翰先生。他说，四点钟他要到奥蒙德饭店去。没有，先生。是的，先生。过五点我给他们打电话。”
<br> 
<br> * * *
<br> 
<br> 两张粉红色的脸借着小小火把的光亮出现了。[90]
<br> 
<br> “谁呀?”内德·兰伯特问，“是克罗蒂吗?”
<br> 
<br> “林加贝拉和克罗斯黑文，”正在用脚探着路的一个声音说。
<br> 
<br> “嘿，杰克，是你吗?”内德·兰伯特说着，在摇曳的火光所映照的拱顶下，扬了扬软木条打着招呼。“过来吧，当心脚底下。”
<br> 
<br> 教士高举着的手里所攥的涂蜡火柴映出一道长长的柔和火焰燃尽了，掉了下去。红色斑点在他们脚跟前熄灭，周围弥漫着发霉的空气。
<br> 
<br> “多有趣!”昏暗中一个文雅的口音说。
<br> 
<br> “是啊，神父，”内德·兰伯特热切地说，“如今咱们正站在圣玛丽修道院的会议厅里。这是一个有历史意义的遗迹。一五三四年，绢骑士托马斯[91]就是在这里宣布造反的。这是整个都柏林最富于历史意义的地方了。关于这事，总有一天奥马登·勃克会写点什么的。合并[92]以前，老爱尔兰银行就在马路对面。犹太人的圣殿原先也设在这儿。后来他们在阿德莱德路盖起了自己的会堂。杰克，你从来没到这儿来过吧?”
<br> 
<br> “没有过，内德。”
<br> 
<br> “他[93]是骑马沿着戴姆人行道来的，”那个文雅的口音说，“倘若我没记错的话，基尔代尔一家人的宅第就在托马斯大院里。”
<br> 
<br> “可不是嘛，”内德·兰伯特说，“一点儿也不错，神父。”
<br> 
<br> “承蒙您的好意，”教士说，“下次可不可以允许我……”
<br> 
<br> “当然可以，”内德·兰伯特说，“什么时候您高兴，就尽管带着照相机来吧。我会叫人把窗口那些口袋清除掉。您可以从这儿，要么从这儿照。”
<br> 
<br> 他在宁静的微光中踱来踱去，用手中的木条敲敲那一袋装堆得高高的种籽，并指点着地板上取景的好去处。
<br> 
<br> 一张长脸蛋上的胡子和视线，部落在一方棋盘上。[94]
<br> 
<br> “深深感谢，兰伯特先生，”教士说，“您的时间宝贵，我不打扰了……”
<br> 
<br> “欢迎您光临，神父，”内德·兰伯特说，“您愿意什么时候光临都行。比方说，下周吧。瞧得见吗?”
<br> 
<br> “瞧得见，瞧得见。那么我就告辞了，兰伯特先生。见到您，我十分高兴。”
<br> 
<br> “我才高兴呢，神父，”内德·兰伯特回答。
<br> 
<br> 他把来客送到出口，随手把木条旋转着掷到圆柱之间。他和杰·杰·奥莫洛伊一道慢悠悠地走进玛丽修道院街。那里，车夫们正往一辆辆平板车上装着一麻袋一麻袋角豆面和椰子粉，韦克斯福德的奥康内尔。[95]
<br> 
<br> 他停下脚步来读手里的名片。
<br> 
<br> “休·C·洛失神父，拉思柯非。[96]现住：萨林斯[97]的圣迈克尔教堂。一个蛮好的年轻人。他告诉我，他正在写一本关于菲茨杰拉德家族[98]的书。他对历史了如指掌，的的确确。”
<br> 
<br> 那个年轻姑娘仔细缓慢地将巴在她那轻飘飘的裙子上的一载小树枝摘掉。[99]
<br> 
<br> “我还只当你在策划另一次火药阴谋[100]呢，”杰·杰·奥莫洛伊说。
<br> 
<br> 内德·兰伯特用手指在空中打了个响榧子。
<br> 
<br> “唉呀！”他失声叫道，“我忘记告诉他基尔代尔伯爵[101]放火烧掉卡舍尔大教堂后所说的那番话了。你晓得他说了什么吗?‘我干了这档子事实在觉得过意不去，’他说，‘然而天主在上，我确实以为大主教正在里面呢。’不过，他也许并不爱听。什么?天哪，不管怎样，我也得告诉他。这就是伟大的伯爵，大[102]菲茨杰拉德。他们统统是火暴性子，杰拉德家族这些人。”
<br> 
<br> 当他走过去时，挽具松了的那些马受了惊，一副紧张的样子。他拍了拍挨着他的那匹花斑马的颤抖的腰腿，喊了声：
<br> 
<br> “吁!好小子!”
<br> 
<br> 他掉过脸来问杰·杰·奥莫洛伊：
<br> 
<br> “呃，杰克。什么事呀?遇到什么麻烦啦?等一会儿。站住。”
<br> 
<br> 他张大了嘴，脑袋使劲朝后仰着，凝然不动地站住，旋即大声打了个喷嚏。
<br> 
<br> “哈哧!”他说，“该死!”
<br> 
<br> “都怪这些麻袋上的灰尘，”杰·杰·奥莫洛伊彬彬有礼地说。
<br> 
<br> “不是，”内德·兰伯特气喘吁吁地说，“我着了……凉，前天……该死……前天晚上……而且，那地方的贼风真厉害……”
<br> 
<br> 他拿好手绢，准备着打下一个……
<br> 
<br> “今天早晨……我到……葛拉斯涅文去了……可怜的小……他叫什么来着……哈哧!……摩西他娘啊!
<br> 
<br> * * *
<br> 
<br> 穿深红色背心的汤姆·罗赤福特手托一摞圆盘，顶在胸前，另一只手拿起最上面的那个。
<br> 
<br> “瞧，”他说，“比方说，这是第六个节目。从这儿进去，瞧。眼下节目正在进行。”
<br> 
<br> 他把圆盘塞进左边的口子给他们看。它顺着槽溜下去，晃了一阵才停住，朝他们飞上一眼：六。[103]
<br> 
<br> 当年的律师[104]趾高气扬，慷慨陈词。他们看见里奇·古尔丁携带着古尔丁－科利斯－沃德律师事务所的帐目公文包，从统一审计办公室一路走到民事诉讼法庭。然后听到一位上了岁数的妇女身穿宽大的丝质黑裙，窸窸窣窣地走出高等法院[105]海事法庭，进了上诉法庭，她面上泛着半信半疑的微笑，露出假牙。
<br> 
<br> “瞧，”他说，“瞧，我最后放进去的那个已经到这儿来了：节目结束。冲击力。杠杆作用。明白了吗?”
<br> 
<br> 他让他们看右边那越摞越高的圆盘。
<br> 
<br> “高明的主意，”大鼻子弗林抽着鼻孔说，“那么来晚了的人就能知道哪个节目正在进行，哪些己经结束了。”
<br> 
<br> “瞧明白了吧?”汤姆·罗赤福特说。
<br> 
<br> 他自己塞进了一个圆盘，望着它溜下去，晃动，飞上一眼，停住：四。正在进行的节目。
<br> 
<br> “我这就到奥蒙德饭店去跟他见面，”利内翰说，“探探口气。好心总会有好报。”
<br> 
<br> “去吧，”汤姆·罗赤福特说，“告诉他，我等博伊兰都等急啦。”
<br> 
<br> “晚安，”麦科伊抽冷子说，“当你们两个人着手干起来的时候…”
<br> 
<br> 大鼻子弗林朝那杠杆弯下身去，嗅着。
<br> 
<br> “可是这地方是怎么活动的呢，汤米?”他问道。
<br> 
<br> “吐啦噜[106]，”利内翰说，“回头见。”
<br> 
<br> 他跟着麦科伊走了出去，穿过克兰普顿大院的小方场。
<br> 
<br> “他是个英雄，”他毫不迟疑地说。
<br> 
<br> “我晓得，”麦科伊说，“你指的是排水沟吧。”
<br> 
<br> “排水沟?”利内翰说，“是阴沟的检修口。”
<br> 
<br> 他们走过丹·劳里游艺场，专演风骚角色的妖媚女演员玛丽·肯德尔从海报上朝他们投以画得很蹩脚的微笑。
<br> 
<br> 他们来到锡卡莫街，沿着帝国游艺场旁的人行道走着，利内翰把事情的来龙去脉讲给麦科伊听。有个阴沟口，就像那讨厌的煤气管一样，卡住了一个可怜的家伙。阴沟里的臭气已把他熏个半死。汤姆·罗赤福特连那件经纪人背心也来不及脱，身上系了根绳子，就不顾一切地下去了。还真行，他用绳子套住那可怜的家伙，两个人就都给拽了上来[107]。
<br> 
<br> “真是英雄的壮举，”他说。
<br> 
<br> 奔杰维斯街。
<br> 
<br> “这边走，”他一面朝右边走一面说，“我要到莱纳姆那儿去瞧瞧‘权杖’[108]的起价。你那块带金链儿的金表几点啦?”
<br> 
<br> 麦科伊窥伺了一下马库斯·特蒂乌斯·摩西那幽暗的办事处，接着又瞧了瞧奥尼尔茶叶店的挂钟。
<br> 
<br> “三点多啦，”他说，“谁骑‘权杖’?”
<br> 
<br> “奥马登”，利内翰说，“那是匹精神十足的小母马。”
<br> 
<br> 在圣殿酒吧前等候的时候，麦科伊躲开一条香蕉皮，然后用脚夹把它轻轻挑到人行道的阴沟里去。谁要是喝得烂醉黑咕隆咚地走到这儿，会很容易就摔个跟头。
<br> 
<br> 为了让总督出行的车马经过，车道[109]前的大门敞开了。
<br> 
<br> “一博一，”利内翰回来说，“我在那儿碰见了班塔穆·莱昂斯。他打算押一匹别人教给他的破马，它压根儿就没有过赢的希望。打这儿穿过去。”
<br> 
<br> 他们拾级而上。在商贾拱廊内，一个黑糊糊的背影正在翻阅着小贩车上的书。
<br> 
<br> “他在那儿呢，”利内翰说。
<br> 
<br> “不晓得他在买什么，”麦科伊说着，回头瞥了一眼。
<br> 
<br> “《利奥波德或稞麦花儿开》[110]，”利内翰说。
<br> 
<br> “他是买减价书的能手，”麦科伊说，“有一天我和他在一起，他在利菲街花两先令从一个老头那儿买了一本书。里面有精采的图片，足足值一倍钱。星星啦，月亮啦，带长尾巴的慧星啦。是一部关于天文学的书。”
<br> 
<br> 利内翰笑了。
<br> 
<br> “我讲给你听一个关于慧星尾巴的极有趣儿的故事，”他说，“站到太阳地儿来。”
<br> 
<br> 他们横过马路来到铁桥跟前，沿着河堤边的惠灵顿码头走去。
<br> 
<br> 少年帕特里克·阿洛伊修斯·迪格纳穆[111]拿着一磅半猪排，从曼根的(原先是费伦巴克的)店里走了出来。
<br> 
<br> “那一次格伦克里的感化院举行了盛大的宴会[112]，”利内翰起劲地说，“要知道，那是一年一度的午餐会。得穿那种浆洗得笔挺的衬衫。市长大人出席了——当时是维尔·狄龙。查尔斯·卡梅伦爵士和丹·道森讲了话，还有音乐。巴特尔·达西演唱了，还有本杰明·多拉德……”
<br> 
<br> “我晓得，”麦科伊插了嘴，“我太太也在那儿唱过一次。”
<br> 
<br> “是吗?”利内翰说。
<br> 
<br> 一张写有“房间出租，自备家具”字样的牌子，又出现在埃克尔斯街七号的窗框上[113]。
<br> 
<br> 他把话打住片刻，接着又喝哧喝哧地喘着气笑开了。
<br> 
<br> “等等，容我来告诉你，”他说，“卡姆登街的德拉亨特包办酒菜，鄙人是勤杂司令。布卢姆夫妇也在场。我们供应的东西可海啦：红葡萄酒、雪利酒、陈皮酒，我们也十分对得起那酒，放开量畅饮一通。喝足了才吃，大块的冷冻肘子有的是，还有百果馅饼[114]……”
<br> 
<br> “我晓得，”麦科伊说，“那一年我太太也在场……”
<br> 
<br> 利内翰兴奋地挽住他的胳膊。
<br> 
<br> “等一等，我来告诉你，”他说，“寻欢作乐够了，我们还吃了一顿夜宵。当我们走出来时，己经是第二天的凌晨几点[115]啦。回家的路上翻过羽床山， 好个出色的冬夜啊，布卢姆和克里斯·卡利南坐在马车的一边，我和他太太坐另一边。我们唱起来了，无伴奏的男声合唱，二重唱。看啊，清晨的微曦[116]。 她那肚带下面灌满了德拉亨特的红葡萄酒。那该死的车子每颠簸一次，她都撞在我身上。那真开心到家啦!她那一对儿可真棒，上主保佑她。像这样的。”
<br> 
<br> 他凹起掌心，将双手伸到胸前一腕尺的地方，蹙着眉头说。
<br> 
<br> “我不停地为她把车毯往腿下掖，并且整一整她披的那条袭皮围巾。明白我的意思吗?”
<br> 
<br> 他用两只手在半空比划出丰满曲线的造型。他快乐得双目紧闭，浑身倦缩着，嘴里吹出悦耳的小鸟啁啾声。
<br> 
<br> “反正那小子直挺挺地竖起来了，”他叹了口气说，“没错儿，那娘儿们是个浪母马。布卢姆把天上所有的星星和慧星都指给克里斯·卡利南和车把式看：什么大熊座啦，武仙座啦，天龙座啦，和其他繁星。可是，对上主发誓，我可以说是身心都沉浸在银河里了。说真格的，他全都认得出。她终于找到一颗很远很远一丁点儿大的小不点儿。‘那是什么星呀，波尔迪?’她说，上主啊，她可给布卢姆出了个难题。‘那一颗吗?’克里斯·卡利南说，‘没错儿，那说得上是个小针眼儿[117]。哎呀，他说的倒是八九不离十。”
<br> 
<br> 利内翰停下脚步，身倚河堤，低声笑得上气不接下气。
<br> 
<br> “我实在支持不住啦，”他气喘吁吁地说。
<br> 
<br> 麦科伊那张白脸不时地对此泛出一丝微笑，随即神情又变得严肃起来。利内翰又往前走着。他摘下游艇帽，匆匆地挠挠后脑勺。沐浴在阳光下，他斜睨了麦科伊一眼。
<br> 
<br> “他真是有教养有见识的人，布卢姆是这样的一位，”他一本正经地说，“他不是你们那种凡夫俗子……要知道……老布卢姆身上有那么一股艺术家气质。”
<br> 
<br> * * *
<br> 
<br> 布卢姆先生漫不经心地翻着《玛丽亚·蒙克的骇人秘闻》[118]，然后又拿起亚理斯多德的《杰作》。印刷得歪七扭八，一塌糊涂。插图有：胎儿蜷缩在一个个血红的子宫里，恰似屠宰后的母牛的肝脏。如今，全世界到处都是。统统想用脑壳往外冲撞。每一分钟都会有娃娃在什么地方诞生。普里福伊太太[119]。
<br> 
<br> 他把两本书都撂在一劳，视线移到第三本上：利奥波德·封·扎赫尔－马索赫所著《犹太人区的故事》[120]。
<br> 
<br> “这本我读过，”他说着，把它推开。
<br> 
<br> 书摊老板另撂了两本在柜台上。
<br> 
<br> “这两本可好咧，”他说。
<br> 
<br> 隔着柜台，一股葱头气味从他那牙齿残缺不全的嘴里袭来。他弯下腰去，将其余的书捆起来，顶着没系钮扣的背心摞了摞，然后就抱到肮里肮脏的帷幕后面去丁。
<br> 
<br> 奥康内尔桥上，好多人在望着舞蹈等课程的教师丹尼斯·杰·马金尼先生。他一派端庄的仪态，却穿着花里胡哨的服装。
<br> 
<br> 布卢姆独自在看着书名。詹姆斯·洛夫伯奇[121]的《美丽的暴君们》。晓得是哪一类的书。有过吧?有过。
<br> 
<br> 他翻了翻。果不其然。
<br> 
<br> 从肮里肮脏的帷幕后面传出来女人的嗓音。听：那个男人。
<br> 
<br> 不行，这么厉害的不会中她的意。曾经给她弄到过一本。
<br> 
<br> 他读着另一本的书名：《偷情的快乐》。这会更合她的胃口。拿来看看。
<br> 
<br> 他随手翻到一页就读起来：
<br> 
<br> 她丈夫给她的那一张张一元钞票，她都花在店铺里那些
<br> 
<br> 华丽的长衫和昂贵无比的镶有褶边的裙子上了。为了他!为
<br> 
<br> 了拉乌尔[122]!
<br> 
<br> 对。就这一本。怎么样?试试看。
<br> 
<br> 她的嘴紧紧嘬住地的嘴，淫亵放荡地狂吻着；他呢，这当
<br> 
<br> 儿把双手伸进她的衫襟，去抚摩她那丰满的曲线。
<br> 
<br> 对。就要这一本吧。它的结尾是：
<br> 
<br> “你来迟了，”他嗓音嗄哑地说，用炯炯的怀疑目光瞪着
<br> 
<br> 她。
<br> 
<br> 那位美女把她那镶边的貉皮大氅脱下来甩在一边，裸露
<br> 
<br> 出王后般的双肩和一起一伏的丰腴魁力。她安详地朝他掉转
<br> 
<br> 过来，无比可爱的唇边泛着一丝若隐若现的微笑。
<br> 
<br> 布卢姆先生又读了一遍，那位美女……
<br> 
<br> 一股暖流悄悄地浸透他全身，镇慑着他的肉体。在揉皱了的衣服里面，肉体彻头彻尾地屈服了。眼白神魂颠倒般地往上一翻。 他的鼻孔像是在寻觅猎物一般拱了起来。涂在乳房上的油膏(为了他!为了拉乌尔!)融化了。腋窝下的汗水发出葱头般的气味。鱼胶般的黏液(她那一起一伏的丰腴魅力!)摸摸看!按一按!粉碎啦!两头狮子那硫磺气味的粪!
<br> 
<br> 青春!青春!
<br> 
<br> 一位上了岁数、不再年轻的妇女正从大法院、高等法院、税务法庭和高级民事法院共用的大厦里踱了出来。她刚在大法官主持的法庭里旁听了波特顿神经错乱案;在海事法庭上聆听了“凯恩斯夫人号”船主们对“莫纳号”三桅帆船船主们一案的申诉以及当事者一方的辩解;在上诉法庭，倾听了法庭所做关于暂缓审判哈维与海洋事故保险公司一案的决定。
<br> 
<br> 一阵含痰的咳嗽声在书摊的空气中回荡着， 把肮里肮脏的帷幕都震得鼓鼓的。摊主咳嗽着走出来了。他那灰白脑袋不曾梳理过，涨红了的脸也没刮过。他粗鲁地清着喉咙，往地板上吐了口黏痰。然后，伸出靴子来踩住自己吐出的，并且弯下腰去，用靴底蹭了蹭。这样，就露出他那剩下不几根毛的秃瓢。
<br> 
<br> 布卢姆先生望到了。
<br> 
<br> 他抑制着恶心的感觉，说：
<br> 
<br> “我要这一本。”
<br> 
<br> 摊主抬起那双被积下的眼屎弄得视力模糊的眼睛。
<br> 
<br> “《偷情的快乐》，”他边敲着书边说，“这是本好书。”
<br>

<br> 
<br> 站在狄龙拍卖行门旁的伙计又摇了两遍手铃，并且对着用粉笔做了记号的大衣柜镜子照了照自己这副尊容。
<br> 
<br> 呆在人行道边石上的迪丽·迪达勒斯听到铃声和里面拍卖商的吆喝声。四先令九。那些可爱的帘子。五先令。使人感到舒适的帘子。新的值两基尼哪。五先令还有加的吗?五先令成交啦。
<br> 
<br> 伙计举起手铃摇了摇：
<br> 
<br> “当啷!”
<br> 
<br> 最后一圈的铃声响起时，这半英里自行车赛[123]的选手们冲刺起来。J·A·杰克逊、W·E·怀利、A·芒罗和H·T·加恩，都伸长了脖子，东摇西摆， 巧妙地驰过了学院图书馆旁的弯道。
<br> 
<br> 迪达勒斯先生捋着长长的八字胡，从威廉斯横街拐了过来。他在女儿身边停下脚步。
<br> 
<br> “来得正是时候，”她说。
<br> 
<br> “求求你啦，站直了吧，”迪达勒斯先生说，“难道你想学你那吹短号的约翰舅舅[124]，把脑袋缩在肩膀上吗?瞧你这副样子!”
<br> 
<br> 迪丽耸了耸肩。迪达勒斯先生双手按住她的肩膀往后扳。
<br> 
<br> “站得直直的，丫头，”他说，“不然你会害上脊椎弯曲病的。你晓得自已像个什么样儿吗?”
<br> 
<br> 他蓦地垂下脑袋，往前一伸，并拱起肩，把下颚向下一耷拉。
<br> 
<br> “别这样，爹”，迪丽说，“大家都在望着你哪。”
<br> 
<br> 迪达勒斯先生直起身子，又去捋他那八字胡。
<br> 
<br> “你弄到点钱了吗?”迪丽问。
<br> 
<br> “我上哪儿弄钱去?”迪达勒斯先生说，“在都柏林，没人肯借给我四便士。”
<br> 
<br> “你准弄到了点儿，”迪丽盯着他的眼睛说。
<br> 
<br> “你怎么晓得?”迪达勒斯先生用舌头顶着腮帮子说。
<br> 
<br> 克南[125]先生对自已揽到的这笔订货踌躇满志，正沿着詹姆斯大街高视阔步。
<br> 
<br> “我晓得你弄到啦，”迪丽回答说，“刚才你呆在苏格兰酒家里来着吧?”
<br> 
<br> “我没去呀，”、迪达勒斯先生笑吟吟地说，“是那些小尼姑把你教得这么调皮吧?拿去。”
<br> 
<br> 他递给她一先令。
<br> 
<br> “看看这够你顶什么用的，”他说。
<br> 
<br> “我猜你准弄到了五先令，”迪丽说，“再给我点儿吧。”
<br> 
<br> “等一会儿，”迪达勒斯先生用恐吓的口吻说，“你跟那几个都是一路货，对吧?自从你们那可怜的妈咽气以后，你们就成了一帮不知天高地厚的小母狗啦。可是等着瞧吧。迟早我会把你们彻头彻尾摆脱掉的。满口下流的脏话!我会甩掉你们的。 哪怕我硬挺挺地抻丁腿儿，你们也无动于衷。说什么：‘他死啦，楼上那家伙咽气拉。’”
<br> 
<br> 他撇下她，往前走去。迪丽赶忙跟上去，拽住他的上衣。
<br> 
<br> “喂，干吗呀?”他停下脚步来说。
<br> 
<br> 伙计在他们背后摇铃。
<br> 
<br> “当啷啷!”
<br> 
<br> “叫你这吵吵闹闹的混帐家伙挨天罚!”迪达勒斯先生掉过身去冲他嚷着。
<br> 
<br> 伙计意识到这话是朝他来的，就很轻很轻地摇着那耷拉下来的铃舌。
<br> 
<br> “当!”
<br> 
<br> 迪达勒斯先生狠狠地盯了他一眼。
<br> 
<br> “瞧瞧这个人，”他说，“真有点儿意思。我倒想知道他还让不让咱们说话啦。” 
<br> 
<br> “爹，你弄到的钱不止这么些，”迪丽说。
<br> 
<br> “我要玩个小花招儿给你们看，”迪达勒斯先生说，“我要撇下你们这一帮，就像当年耶稣撇下犹太人那样。[126]瞧，我统共只有这么多。 我从杰克·鲍尔那儿弄到了两先令，为了参加葬礼，还花两便士刮了一下脸。”
<br> 
<br> 他局促不安地掏出一把铜币。
<br> 
<br> “难道你不能从什么地方寻摸俩钱儿来吗?”迪丽说。
<br> 
<br> 迪达勒斯先生沉吟了一阵，点了点头。
<br> 
<br> “好吧，”他认认真真地说，“我是沿着奥康内尔大街的明沟一路寻摸过来的。这会子我再去这条街试试看。”
<br> 
<br> “你滑稽透了，”迪丽说，她笑得露出了牙齿。
<br> 
<br> “喏，”说着，迪达勒斯先生递给她两便士，“去弄杯牛奶喝，再买个小圆甜面包什么的。我马上就回家。”
<br> 
<br> 他把其他硬币揣回兜里，继续往前走。
<br> 
<br> 总督的车马队在警察卑躬屈膝的敬礼下，穿过公园大门。
<br> 
<br> “你准还有一先令，”迪丽说。
<br> 
<br> 伙计把铃摇得山响。
<br> 
<br> 迪达勒斯先生在一片喧嚣中走开了。他噘起嘴来轻声喃喃自语着，
<br> 
<br> “小尼姑们!有趣的小妞儿们!噢，她们准不会帮忙的!噢，她们确实不会帮的!是小莫妮卡修女[127]吧!”
<br>

<br> 
<br> 克南先生从日晷台走向詹姆斯门，异常得意自己从普尔布鲁克·罗伯逊那儿揽到的订货，沿着詹姆斯大街高视阔步地走过莎克尔顿面粉公司营业处。 总算把他说服了。您好吗，克里敏斯[128]先生?好极啦，先生。我还担心您到平利科那另一家公司去了呢。生意怎么样?对付着糊口罢咧。这天气多好哇。可不是嘛。 对农村是再好不过嘞。那些庄稼汉总是发牢骚。给我来一点点您上好的杜松子酒吧， 克里敏斯先生。一小杯杜松子酒吗，先生?是的，先生。“斯洛克姆将军”号爆炸事件[129]太可怕啦。可怕呀，可怕呀!死伤一千人。一派惨绝人寰的景象。一些汉子把妇女和娃娃都踩在脚底下。简直是禽兽。关于肇事原因，他们是怎么说来着?说是自动爆炸。暴露出来的情况真令人震惊。水上竟然没有一只救生艇，水龙带统统破裂了。我简直不明白，那些检验员怎么竟允许像那样一艘船……喏，您说得有道理，克里敏斯先生。您晓得个中底细吗?行了贿呗。是真的吗?毫无疑问。嗯，瞧瞧吧。还说美国是个自由的国度哩。我本来以为糟糕的只是咱们这里呢。
<br> 
<br> 我[130]对他笑了笑。“美国嘛，”我像这样安详地说，“这又算得了什么?这是从包括敝国在内的各国扫出来的垃圾。不就是这么回事吗?”确实是这样的。
<br> 
<br> 贪污，我亲爱的先生。喏，当然喽，只要金钱在周转，必定就会有人把它捞到手。
<br> 
<br> 我发现他在打量我的大礼服。人就靠服装。再也没有比体面的衣着更起作用的了。能够镇住他们。
<br> 
<br> “你好，西蒙，”考利神父[131]说，“近来怎么样?”
<br> 
<br> “你好，鲍勃，老伙计，”迪达勒斯先生停下脚步，回答说。
<br> 
<br> 克南先生站在理发师彼得·肯尼迪那面倾斜的镜子前梳妆打扮了一番。毫无疑问，这是件款式新颖的上衣。道森街的斯科特[132]。我付了尼亚利半镑钱， 蛮值得。要是订做一件的话，起码也得三基尼。穿上哪儿哪儿都可身。原先多半是基尔代尔街俱乐部[133]哪位花花公子的。昨天在卡莱尔桥上，爱尔兰银行经理约翰·穆利根用锐利的目光好盯了我两眼，他好像认出了我似的。
<br> 
<br> 哎嘿!在这些人面前就得讲究穿戴。马路骑士[134]。绅士。就这么样，克里敏斯先生，希望以后继续光顾。俗话说得好，这是使人提神而又不醉的饮料[135]。
<br> 
<br> 北堤和布满了一个个船体、一条条锚链的约翰·罗杰森[136]爵士码头;一叶小舟——揉成一团丢下去的传单，在摆渡驶过后的尾流中颠簸着，向西漂去了。 “以利亚未了。”[137]
<br> 
<br> 克南先生临别对镜顾影自怜。脸色黑红，当然喽。花白胡髭。活像是曾在印度服役回国的军官。他端着膀子，迈着戴鞋罩的脚，雄赳赳地移动那矮粗身躯。马路对面那人是内德·兰伯特的弟弟萨姆吧?怎么?是的。可真像他哩。不对，是那边阳光底下那辆汽车的挡风玻璃，那么一闪。活脱儿像是他。
<br> 
<br> 哎嘿!含杜松液的烈酒使他的内脏和呼出来的气都暖烘烘的。 那可是一杯好杜松子酒。肥肥胖胖的他，大摇大摆地走着，燕尾礼服随着他的步伐在骄阳下闪闪发光。
<br> 
<br> 埃米特[138]就是在前面那个地方被绞死的，掏出五脏六腑之后还肢解。油腻腻、黑魁魁的绳子。当总督夫人乘双轮马车经过的时候，几只狗正在街上舔着鲜血哩。[139]
<br> 
<br> 那可是邪恶横行的时代。算啦，算啦。过去了，总算结束啦。又都是大酒鬼。个个能喝上四瓶。
<br> 
<br> 我想想看。他是葬在圣迈肯教堂的吗?啊不，葛拉斯涅文倒是在午夜里埋过一次。尸体是从墙上的一道暗门弄进去的。如今迪格纳穆就在那儿哩。像是被一阵风卷走的。哎呀呀。不如在这儿拐个弯。绕点儿路吧。
<br> 
<br> 克南先生掉转了方向。从古尼斯啤酒公司接待室的拐角，沿着华特灵大道的下坡路走去。都柏林制酒公司的栈房外面停着一辆游览车[140]，既没有乘客，也没有车把式，缰绳系在车轱辘上。这么做，好险呀。准是从蒂珀雷里[141]来的哪个笨蛋在拿市民的命开玩笑。倘若马脱了缰呢?
<br> 
<br> 丹尼斯·布林夹着他那两部大书，在约翰·亨利·门顿的事务所等了一个小时。然后腻烦了，就带着妻子踱过奥康内尔桥，直奔考立斯－沃德法律事务所。
<br> 
<br> 克南先生来到岛街附近了。那是多事之秋。得向内德·兰伯特借借乔纳·巴林顿[142]爵士回忆录。回首往事，回忆录读来就把过去的一切都井井有条地排列起来。在达利俱乐部赌博来着。当时还不兴玩牌时作弊。其中一个家伙被人用匕首把手钉在牌桌上了。爱德华·菲茨杰拉德勋爵[143]就是在这左近甩掉塞尔少校，逃之夭夭的。莫伊拉邸第后面的马厩[144]。
<br> 
<br> 那杜松子可真是好酒。
<br> 
<br> 那是个英姿潇洒的贵公子。当然是出自名门喽。那个恶棍，那戴紫罗兰色手套的冒牌乡绅，把他出卖了。当然他们站到错误的一边。他们是在黑暗邪恶的日子里挺身而出的。那是一首好诗，英格拉姆[145]作的。他们是君子。那首歌谣本·多拉德唱起来确实感人。天衣无缝的表演。
<br> 
<br> 罗斯包围战，我爹勇捐躯。[146]
<br> 
<br> 一队车马从从容容地走边彭布罗克码头[147]，骑在马上簇拥着车辆的侍卫们，在鞍上颠簸着，颠簸着。大礼服。嫩黄色的旱伞。
<br> 
<br> 克南先生匆匆朝前赶去，一路气喘吁吁。
<br> 
<br> 总督阁下!糟糕透啦!刚好失之交臂。真该死！太可惜啦!
<br> 
<br> * * *
<br> 
<br> 斯蒂芬·迪达勒斯隔着罩了铁丝网的窗户，注视着宝石匠[148]的手指在检验一条被岁月磨乌了的链子。尘土像丝网般密布在窗户和陈列盘上。指甲酷似鹰爪的勤劳的手指，也给尘土弄得发暗了。一盘盘颜色晦暗的青铜丝和银丝，菱形的朱砂、红玉以及那些带鳞状斑纹的和绛色的宝石上，都蒙着厚厚的积尘。
<br> 
<br> 这些统统产于黑暗而蠕动着蚯蚓的土壤。火焰的冰冷颗粒，不祥之物，在黑暗中发光。沉沦的大天使把他们额上的星星丢在这儿了。满是泥泞的猪鼻子啊，手啊，又是拱，又是掘，把它们紧紧攥住，吃力地弄到手里。
<br> 
<br> 这里，橡胶与大蒜一道燃着。在一片昏暗中，她翩翩起舞。一个留着赤褐色胡子的水手，边呷着大酒杯里的甘蔗酒，边盯着她。长期的航海生涯不知不觉地使他淫欲旺盛起来。她跳啊蹦啊，扭动着她那母猪般的腰腿和臀部。卵状红玉在肥大的肚皮上摆动着。
<br> 
<br> 老拉塞尔又用一块污迹斑斑的麂皮揩拭出宝石的光泽，把它旋转一下，举到摩西式长胡子梢那儿去端详。猴爷爷贪婪地盯着偷来的珍藏。[149]
<br> 
<br> 而你这个从墓地刨出古老形象的人，又当如何?诡辩家的狂言谵语：安提西尼。推销不出去的学识。光辉夺目、长生不朽的小麦，从亘古到永远。[150]
<br> 
<br> 两个老妪[151]刚被含有潮水气味的风吹拂了一阵。她们拖着沉重的脚步沿着伦敦桥路穿过爱尔兰区，一个握着巴满沙子的破旧雨伞，另一个提着产婆用的手提包，里面滚动着十一只蛤蜊。
<br> 
<br> 电力站发出的皮带旋转的噼噼啪啪声以及发电机的隆隆声催促着斯蒂芬赶路。无生命的生命。等一等!外界那无休止的搏动和内部这无休止的搏动。[152]你咏唱的是你那颗心。我介于它们之间?在哪儿?就在两个喧哗、回旋的世界之间——我。砸烂它们算了，两个都砸烂。可是一拳下去，把我也打昏过去吧。谁有力气，尽管把我砸烂了吧。说来既是老鸨，又是屠夫。[153]且慢!一时还定不下来。四下里望望再说。
<br> 
<br> 对，真是这样。大极了，好得很，非常准时。[154]先生，你说得不错。在星期一早晨。正是正是。[155]
<br> 
<br> 斯蒂芬边顺着贝德福德横街走去，边用梣木手杖的柄磕打着肩胛骨。克罗希赛书店橱窗里一幅一八六0年晒印的褪了色的版画吸引了他的目光。 那是希南对塞耶斯的拳击比赛[156]。头戴大礼帽的助威者瞪大了眼睛站在圈了绳子的拳击场周围。两个重量级拳击手穿着紧身小裤衩，彼此把球茎状的拳头柔和地伸向对方。然而它们——英雄们的心脏——正在怦怦直跳。
<br> 
<br> 他掉过身去，在斜立着的书车跟前站了下来。
<br> 
<br> “两便士一本，”摊主说，“六便士四本。”
<br> 
<br> 净是些破破烂烂的。《爱尔兰养蜂人》[157]、《阿尔斯教士传记及奇迹》[158]、《基拉尼导游手册》。
<br> 
<br> 兴许能在这儿找到一本我在学校获得后又典当了的奖品。年级奖：奖给优等生斯蒂芬·迪达勒斯。[159]
<br> 
<br> 康米神父已诵读完了九时课，他边喃喃地作着晚祷，边穿过唐尼卡尼小村。
<br> 
<br> 装帧好像太讲究了，这是什么书啊?《摩西经书》第八、第九卷。[160]大卫王的御玺[161]。书页上还沾着拇指痕迹，准是一遍又一遍地被读过的。 在我之前是谁打这儿经过的?怎样能使皲裂的手变得柔软。用白葡萄酒酿造醋的秘方。 怎样赢得女性的爱情。这对我合适。双手合十，将下列咒语念诵三遍：
<br> 
<br> 受天主保佑的女性的小天堂!请只爱我一人!
<br> 
<br> 神圣的!啊们![162]
<br> 
<br> 这是谁写的?最圣洁的修道院院长彼得·萨兰卡[163]的咒语和祷文，公诸于所有信男信女。赛得过任何一位修道院院长的咒语，譬如说话含糊不清的约阿基姆。下来吧，秃瓢儿，不然就薅光你的毛。[164]
<br> 
<br> “你在这儿干什么哪，斯蒂芬?”
<br> 
<br> 迪丽那高耸的双肩和槛褛的衣衫。
<br> 
<br> 快合上书，别让她瞧见。
<br> 
<br> “你干什么哪?”斯蒂芬说。
<br> 
<br> 最显赫的查理般的斯图尔特[165]脸庞，长长的直发披到肩上。当她蹲下去，把破靴子塞到火里当燃料的时候，两颊被映红了。我对她讲巴黎的事。她喜欢躺在床上睡懒觉，把几件旧大衣当被子盖，抚弄着丹·凯利送的纪念品———只金色黄铜手镯。天主保佑的女性。
<br> 
<br> “你拿着什么？”斯蒂芬问。
<br> 
<br> “我花一便士从另外那辆车上买的，”迪丽怯生生地笑着说，“值得一看吗？”
<br> 
<br> 人家都说她这双眼睛活脱儿像我。在别人眼里，我是这样的吗？敏捷，神情恍惚，果敢。我心灵的影子。
<br> 
<br> 他从她手里拿过那本掉了封皮的书。夏登纳尔的《法语初级读本》。
<br> 
<br> “你干吗要买它？”他问，“想学法语吗？”
<br> 
<br> 她点点头，飞红了脸，把嘴抿得紧紧的。
<br> 
<br> 不要露出惊讶的样子。事情十分自然。
<br> 
<br> “给你，”斯蒂芬说，“这还行。留神别让玛吉给你当掉了。我的书大概统统光了。”
<br> 
<br> “一部分，”迪丽说，“我们也是不得已啊。”
<br> 
<br> 她快淹死了。内心的苛责。救救她吧。内心的苛责。一切都跟我们作对。她会使我同她一道淹死的，连眼睛带头发。又长又柔软的海藻头发缠绕着我，我的心，我的灵魂。咸绿的死亡。
<br> 
<br> 我们。
<br> 
<br> 内心的苛责。内心受到苛责。
<br> 
<br> 苦恼！苦恼！
<br> 
<br> ＊ ＊ ＊
<br> 
<br> “你好，西蒙，”考利神父说，“近来怎么样？”
<br> 
<br> “你好，鲍勃，老伙计，”迪达勒斯先生停下脚步，回答说。
<br> 
<br> 他们在雷迪父女古董店外面吵吵嚷嚷地握手。考利神父勾拢着手背频频朝下捋着八字胡。
<br> 
<br> “有什么最好的消息？”迪达勒斯先生问。
<br> 
<br> “没什么了不起的，”考利神父说，“我被围困住了，西蒙，有两个人在我家周围荡来荡去，拼命想闯进来。”
<br> 
<br> “真逗，”迪达勒斯先生说，“是谁指使的呀？”
<br> 
<br> “哦，”考利神父说，“是咱们认识的一个放高利货的。”
<br> 
<br> “那个罗锅儿吧，是吗？”迪达勒斯先生问。
<br> 
<br> “就是他，”考利神父回答说，“那个民族[166]的吕便。我正在等候本·多拉德。他这就去跟高个儿约翰[167]打声招呼，请他把那两个人打发掉。我只要求宽限一段时间。”
<br> 
<br> 他抱着茫然的期待上上下下打量着码头，挺大的喉结在脖颈上凸了出来。
<br> 
<br> “我明白，”迪达勒斯先生点点头说，“本这个可怜的老罗圈腿！
<br> 
<br> 他一向总替人作好事。紧紧抓住本吧！”
<br> 
<br> 他戴上眼镜，朝铁桥瞥了一眼。
<br> 
<br> “他来了，”他说，“没错儿，连屁股带兜儿都来啦。”
<br> 
<br> 穿着宽松的蓝色常礼服、头戴大礼帽、下面是肥大裤子的本·多拉德的身姿，迈着大步从铁桥那边穿过码头走了过来。他一面溜溜达达地朝他们踱来，一面在上衣后摆所遮住的部位起劲地挠着。
<br> 
<br> 当他走近后，迪达勒斯先生招呼说：
<br> 
<br> “抓住这个穿不像样子的裤子的家伙。”
<br> 
<br> “现在就抓吧，”本·多拉德说。
<br> 
<br> 迪达勒斯先生以冷峭的目光从头到脚审视本·多拉德一通，随后掉过身去朝考利神父点了点头，讥讽地咕哝道：
<br> 
<br> “夏天穿这么一身，倒蛮标致哩，对吧？”
<br> 
<br> “哼，但愿你的灵魂永遭天罚，”本·多拉德怒不可遏地吼道：
<br> 
<br> “我当年丢掉的衣服比你所曾见过的还多哩。”
<br> 
<br> 他站在他们旁边，先朝他们，接着又朝自己那身松松垮垮的衣服眉飞色舞地望望。迪达勒斯先生一面从他的衣服上边东一处西一处地掸掉绒毛，一面说：
<br> 
<br> “无论如何，本，这身衣服是做给身强体健的汉子穿的。”
<br> 
<br> “让那个做衣服的犹太佬遭殃，”本·多拉德说，“谢天谢地，他还没拿到工钱哪。”
<br> 
<br> “本杰明，你那最低音[168]怎么样啦？”考利神父问。
<br> 
<br> 卡什尔·傅伊尔·奥康内尔·菲茨莫里斯·蒂斯代尔·法雷尔戴着副眼镜，嘴里念念有词，大步流星地从基尔代尔街俱乐部前走过。
<br> 
<br> 本·多拉德皱起眉头，突然以领唱者的口型，发出个深沉的音符。
<br> 
<br> “噢！”他说。
<br> 
<br> “就是这个腔调，”迪达勒斯先生说，点头对这声单调的低音表示赞许。
<br> 
<br> “怎么样？”本·多拉德说，“还不赖吧？怎么样？”
<br> 
<br> 他掉过身去对着他们两个人。
<br> 
<br> “行啊，”考利神父也点了点头，说。
<br> 
<br> 休·C。洛夫神父从圣玛利修道院那古老的教士会堂踱出来，在杰拉尔丁家族那些高大英俊的人们陪伴下，经过詹姆斯与查理·肯尼迪合成酒厂，穿过围栏渡口，朝索尔塞尔走去。[169] 
<br> 
<br> 本·多拉德把沉甸甸的身子朝那排商店的门面倾斜着，手指在空中快乐地比比划划，领着他们前行。
<br> 
<br> “跟我一道到副行政长官的办事处去，”他说，“我要让你们开开眼，让你们看看罗克[177]新任命为法警的那个美男子。那家伙是罗本古拉和林奇豪恩[171]的混合物。你们听着，他值得一瞧。来吧。刚才我在博德加[172]偶然碰见了约翰·亨利·门顿。除非我……等一等……否则我会栽跟头的。咱们的路子走对了，鲍勃，你相信我好啦。”
<br> 
<br> “告诉他，只消宽限几天，”考利神父忧心忡忡他说。
<br> 
<br> 本·多拉德站住了，两眼一瞪，张大了音量很大的嘴，为了听得真切一些，伸手去抠掉厚厚地巴在眼睛上的眼屎。这当儿，上衣的一颗钮扣露着锃亮的背面， 吊在仅剩的一根线上，晃啊晃的。
<br> 
<br> “什么几天？”他声音洪亮地问，“你的房东不是扣押了你的财物来抵偿房租吗？”
<br> 
<br> “可不是嘛，”考利神父说。
<br> 
<br> “那么，咱们那位朋友的传票就还不如印它的那张纸值钱呢，”本·多拉德说，“房东有优先权。我把细目统统告诉他了。温泽大街二十九号，姓洛夫吧？”
<br> 
<br> “对呀，”考利神父说，“洛夫神父。他在乡下某地传教。可是，你对这有把握吗？”
<br> 
<br> “你可以替我告诉巴拉巴[173]，”本·多拉德说，“说他最好把那张传票收起来，就好比猴子把坚果收藏起来一样。”
<br> 
<br> 他勇敢地领着考利神父朝前走去，就像是把神父拴在自己那庞大的身躯上似的。
<br> 
<br> “我相信那是榛子，”迪达勒斯先生边说边让夹鼻眼镜耷拉在上衣胸前，跟随他们而去。
<br>

<br> 
<br> “小家伙们总会得到妥善安置的，”当他们迈出城堡大院的大门时，马丁·坎宁翰说。
<br> 
<br> 警察行了个举手礼。
<br> 
<br> “辛苦啦，”马丁·坎宁翰欣然说。
<br> 
<br> 他向等候着的车夫打了个手势，车夫甩了甩缰绳，直奔爱德华勋爵街而去。
<br> 
<br> 揭发挨着金发，肯尼迪小姐的头挨着杜丝小姐的头，双双出现在奥蒙德饭店的半截儿窗帘上端。[174] 
<br> 
<br> “是啊，”马丁·坎宁翰用手指捋着胡子说，“我给康米神父写了封信，向他和盘托出了。”
<br> 
<br> “你不妨找咱们的朋友试试看，”鲍尔先生怯生生地建议。
<br> 
<br> “博伊德[175] ？”马丁·坎宁翰干干脆脆他说，“算了吧。”
<br> 
<br> 约翰·怀斯·诺兰落在后面看名单，然后沿着科克山的下坡路匆匆赶了上来。
<br> 
<br> 在市政府门前的台阶上，正往下走着的市政委员南尼蒂同往上走的市参议员考利以及市政委员亚伯拉罕·莱昂打了招呼。
<br> 
<br> 总督府的车空空荡荡地开进了交易所街。
<br> 
<br> “喂，马丁，”约翰·怀斯·诺兰在《邮报》报社门口赶上了他们，说，“我看到布卢姆马上认捐五先令哩。”
<br> 
<br> “正是这样！”马丁·坎宁翰接过名单来说，“还当场拍出这五先令。”
<br> 
<br> “而且二句话没说，”鲍尔先生说。
<br> 
<br> “真不可思议，然而的确如此，”马丁·坎宁翰补上一句。
<br> 
<br> 约翰·怀斯惊奇地睁大了眼睛。
<br> 
<br> “我认为这个犹太人的心肠倒不坏呢，[176]” 他文雅地引用了这么一句话。
<br> 
<br> 他们沿着议会街走去。
<br> 
<br> “看，吉米·亨利[177] 在那儿哪，”鲍尔先生说，“他正朝着卡瓦纳的酒吧走呢。”
<br> 
<br> “果不其然，”马丁·坎宁翰说，“快去！”
<br> 
<br> 克莱尔屋外面，布莱泽斯·博伊兰截住杰克·穆尼的内弟[ 178] ——这个筋骨隆起的人正醉醺醺地走向自由区。
<br> 
<br> 约翰·怀斯·诺兰和鲍尔先生落在后面，马丁·坎宁翰则挽住一位身穿带白斑点的深色衣服、整洁而短小精悍的人，那个人正迈着急促的脚步趔趔趄趄地从米基·安德森的钟表铺前走过。
<br> 
<br> “副秘书长[179] ）脚上长的鸡眼可给了他点儿苦头吃，”约翰·怀斯·诺兰告诉鲍尔先生。
<br> 
<br> 他们跟在后头拐过街角，走向詹姆斯·卡瓦纳的酒馆。总督府那辆空车就在他们前方，停在埃塞克斯大门里。马丁·坎宁翰说个不停，频频打开那张名单，吉米·亨利却不屑一顾。
<br> 
<br> “高个儿约翰·范宁也在这里，”约翰·怀斯·诺兰说，“千真万确。”
<br> 
<br> 高个儿约翰·范宁站在门口，他这个庞然大物把甬道整个给堵住了。
<br> 
<br> “您好，副长官先生，”当大家停下来打招呼时，马丁·坎宁翰说。
<br> 
<br> 高个儿约翰·范宁并不为他们让路。他毅然取下叼在嘴里的那一大支亨利·克莱[180] ，他那双严峻的大眼睛机智地怒视着他们每个人的脸。
<br> 
<br> “立法议会议员们还在心平气和地继续协商着吧？”他用充满讥讽的口吻对副秘书长说。
<br> 
<br> 吉米·亨利不耐烦他说，给他们那该死的爱尔兰语[181] 闹腾得地狱都为基督教徒裂开了口。[182] 他倒是想知道，市政典礼官究竟哪儿去啦，[183] 怎么不来维持一下市政委员会会场上的秩序。而执权杖的老巴洛因哮喘发作病倒了。 桌上没有权杖，秩序一片混乱，连法定人数都不足。哈钦森市长在兰迪德诺[184]呢， 由小个子洛坎·舍罗克作他的临时代理[185]。该死的爱尔兰语，咱们祖先的语言。
<br> 
<br> 高个儿约翰·范宁从唇间喷出一口羽毛状的轻烟。
<br> 
<br> 马丁·坎宁翰捻着胡子梢，轮流向副秘书长和副长官搭讪着，约翰·怀斯·诺兰则闷声不响。
<br> 
<br> “那个迪格纳穆叫什么名字来着？”高个儿约翰·范宁问。
<br> 
<br> 吉米·亨利愁眉苦脸地抬起左脚。
<br> 
<br> “哎呀，我的鸡眼啊！”他哀求着说，“行行好，咱们上楼来谈吧，我好找个地方儿坐坐。唔！噢！当心点儿！”
<br> 
<br> 他烦躁地从高个子约翰·范宁身旁挤过去，一径上了楼梯。
<br> 
<br> “上来吧，”马丁·坎宁翰对副长官说，“您大概跟他素不相识，不过，兴许您认识他。”
<br> 
<br> 鲍尔先生跟约翰·怀斯·诺兰一道走了进去。
<br> 
<br> 高个儿约翰·范宁正朝着映在镜中的高个儿约翰·范宁走上楼梯。鲍尔先生对那魁梧的背影说：“他曾经是个矮小的老好人。”
<br> 
<br> “个子相当矮小。门顿事务所的那个迪格纳穆，”马丁·坎宁翰说。
<br> 
<br> 高个儿约翰·范宁记不得他了。
<br> 
<br> 外面传来了嘚嘚的马蹄声。
<br> 
<br> “是什么呀？”马丁·坎宁翰说。
<br> 
<br> 大家都就地回过头去。约翰·怀斯·诺兰又走了下来。他从门道的荫凉处瞧见马队正经过议会街，挽具和润泽光滑的马脚在太阳映照下闪闪发着光。它们快活地从他那冷漠而不友好的视线下徐徐走过。领头的那匹往前跳跳窜窜，鞍上骑着开路的侍从们。
<br> 
<br> “怎么回事呀？”
<br> 
<br> 当大家重新走上楼梯的时候，马丁·坎宁翰问道。
<br> 
<br> “那是陆军中将——爱尔兰总督大人，”约翰·怀斯·诺兰从楼梯脚下回答说。
<br> 
<br> ＊ ＊ ＊
<br> 
<br> 当他们从厚实的地毯上走过的时候，勃克·穆利根在巴拿马帽的遮荫下小声对海恩斯说：
<br> 
<br> “瞧，巴涅儿的弟弟。在那儿，角落里。”
<br> 
<br> 他们选择了靠窗的一张小桌子，面对着一个长脸蛋的人——他的胡须和视线都专注在棋盘上。
<br> 
<br> “就是那个人吗？”海恩斯在座位上扭过身去，问道。
<br> 
<br> “对，”穆利根说，“那就是他弟弟约翰·霍华德，咱们的市政典礼官”
<br> 
<br> 约翰·霍华德·巴涅尔沉静地挪动了一只白主教，然后举起那灰不溜秋的爪子去托住脑门子。转瞬之间，在手掌的遮掩下，他两眼闪出妖光，朝自己的对手倏地瞥了一下，再度俯视那鏖战的一角。
<br> 
<br> “我要一客奶油什锦水果[186]， ”海恩斯对女侍说。
<br> 
<br> “两客奶油什锦水果[187] ，”勃克·穆利根说，“还给咱们来点烤饼、黄油和一些糕点。”
<br> 
<br> 她走后，他笑着说：
<br> 
<br> “我们管这家叫作糟糕公司，因为他们供应糟透了的糕点[188] 。哎，可惜你没听到迪达勒斯的《哈姆莱特》论。”
<br> 
<br> 海恩斯打开他那本新买来的书。
<br> 
<br> “真可惜，”他说，“对所有那些头脑失掉平衡的人[189] 来说，莎士比亚都是个最过瘾的猎场。”
<br> 
<br> 独腿水手朝着纳尔逊街十四号[190] 地下室前那块空地嚷道：
<br> 
<br> 英国期待着……
<br> 
<br> 勃克·穆利根笑得连身上那件淡黄色背心都快活地直颤悠。
<br> 
<br> “真想让你看看，”他说，“他的身体失去平衡的那副样子。我管他叫作飘忽不定的安古斯[191] ）。”
<br> 
<br> “我相信他有个固定观念[192] ，”海恩斯用大拇指和食指沉思地掐着下巴说，“眼下我正在揣测着其中有什么内涵。这号人素来是这样的。”
<br> 
<br> 勃克·穆利根一本正经地从桌子对面探过身去。
<br> 
<br> “关于地狱的幻影，”他说，“使他的思路紊乱了。他永远也捕捉不到古希腊的格调。所有那些诗人当中斯温伯恩的格调——苍白的死亡和殷红的诞[193]。 这是他的悲剧。他永远也当不成诗人。[194] 创造的欢乐……”
<br> 
<br> “无止无休的惩罚，”海恩斯马马虎虎地点了点头说，“我晓得了。今儿早晨我跟他争辩过信仰问题。我看出他有点心事。挺有趣儿的是，因为关于这个问题， 维也纳的波科尔尼[195] 教授提出了个饶有趣味的论点。”
<br> 
<br> 勃克·穆利根那双机灵的眼睛注意到女侍来了。他帮助她取下托盘上的东西。
<br> 
<br> “他在古代爱尔兰神话中找不到地狱的痕迹，”海恩斯边快活地饮着酒边说，“好像缺乏道德观念、宿命感、因果报应意识。有点儿不可思议的是，他偏偏有这么个固定观念。他为你们的运动写些文章吗？”
<br> 
<br> 他把两块方糖灵巧地侧着放进起着泡沫的奶油里。勃克·穆利根将一个冒着热气的烤饼掰成两半，往热气腾腾的饼心里涂满了黄油，狼吞虎咽地咬了一口松软的饼心。
<br> 
<br> “十年，”他边嚼边笑着说，“十年之内，他一定要写出点什么。”[196]
<br> 
<br> “好像挺遥远的，”海恩斯若有所思地举起羹匙说，“不过，我并不怀疑他终究会写得出来的。”
<br> 
<br> 他舀了一匙子杯中那圆锥形的奶油，品尝了一下。
<br> 
<br> “我相信这是真正的爱尔兰奶油，”他以容忍的口吻说，“我可不愿意上当。”
<br> 
<br> 以利亚这叶小舟，揉成一团丢掉的轻飘飘的传单，向东航行，沿着一艘艘海轮和拖网渔船的侧腹驶去。它从群岛般的软木浮子[197]当中穿行，将新瓦平街甩在后面[198]，经过本森渡口，并擦过从布里奇沃特运砖来的罗斯韦恩号三桅纵帆船。[199] 
<br> 
<br> ＊ ＊ ＊
<br> 
<br> 阿尔米达诺·阿蒂弗尼踱过霍利斯街，踱过休厄尔场院。跟在他后面的是卡什尔·博伊尔·奥康内尔·菲茨莫里斯·蒂斯代尔·法雷尔，夹在腑下的防尘罩衣、拐杖和雨伞晃荡着。他避开劳·史密斯先生家门前的路灯，穿过街道，沿着梅里恩方场走去。远远地在他后头，一个盲青年正贴着学院校园的围墙，轻敲着地面摸索前行。
<br> 
<br> 卡什尔·博伊尔·奥康内尔·菲茨莫里斯·蒂斯代尔·法雷尔一直走到刘易斯·沃纳先生那快乐的窗下，随后掉转身，跨大步沿着梅里恩方场折回来。一路上晃荡着风衣、拐杖和雨伞。
<br> 
<br> 他在王尔德商号拐角处站住了，朝着张贴在大都市会堂的以利亚[200]这个名字皱了皱眉，又朝远处公爵草坪上的游园地皱了皱眉。镜片在阳光的反射下，他又皱了皱眉。他龇出老鼠般的牙齿，嘟囔道：
<br> 
<br> “我是被迫首肯的。”[201]
<br> 
<br> 他咬牙切齿地咀嚼着这句愤慨的话语，大步流星地向克莱尔街走去。
<br> 
<br> 当他路过布卢姆[202] 先生的牙科诊所窗前时，他那晃晃荡荡的风衣粗暴地蹭着一根正斜敲着探路的细手杖，继续朝前冲去，撞上了一个赢弱的身躯。 盲青年将带着病容的脸掉向他那扬长而去的背影。
<br> 
<br> “天打雷劈的，”他愠怒他说，“不管你是谁，你总比我还瞎呢，你这婊子养的杂种！”[203]
<br> 
<br> ＊ ＊ ＊
<br> 
<br> 在拉基·奥多诺荷律师事务所对面，少年帕特里克·阿洛伊修斯·迪格纳穆手里摸着家里打发他从曼根的店（原先是费伦巴克的店）买来的一磅半猪排，在暖洋洋的威克洛街上不急不忙地溜达着。跟斯托尔太太、奎格利太太和麦克道尔太太一道坐在客厅里，太厌烦无聊了；百叶窗拉得严严实实的，她们全部抽着鼻子，一点点地啜饮着巴尼舅舅从膝尼[204] 的店里取来的黄褐色上等雪利酒。她们吃着乡村风味果仁糕饼的碎屑，靠磨嘴皮子来消磨讨厌的光阴，唉声叹气着。
<br> 
<br> 走过威克洛巷后，来到多伊尔夫人朝服女帽头饰店的橱窗前。他停下了脚步，站在那儿，望着窗里两个裸体拳师向对方屈臂伸出拳头。两个身穿孝服的少年迪格纳穆，从两侧的镜子里，一声不响地张口呆看。都柏林的宠儿迈勒·基奥跟贝内特军士长——贝洛港的职业拳击家[205] 较量，奖金五十英镑。嘿，这场比赛好带劲儿，有瞧头！迈勒·基奥就是这个腰系绿色饰带迎面扑来的汉子。门票两先令，军人减半。我蛮可以把妈糊弄过去。当他转过身时，左边的少年迪格纳穆也跟着转。那就是穿孝服的我喽。什么时候？五月二十二号。当然，这讨厌的比赛总算全过去啦。他转向右边，右面的少年迪格纳穆也转了过来：歪戴行便帽，硬领翘了起来。他抬起下巴，把领口扣平，就瞅见两个拳师旁边还有玛丽·肯德尔（专演风骚角色的妩媚女演员）的肖像。斯托尔抽的纸烟盒子上就印着这号娘儿们。有一回他正抽着，给他老爹撞见了，狠狠地揍了他一顿
<br> 
<br> 少年迪格纳穆把领口扣平贴了之后，又溜溜达达往前走。菲茨西蒙斯是天下最有力气的拳击手了。要是那家伙嗖地朝你的腰上来一拳，就得叫你躺到下星期，不含糊！可是论技巧，最棒的拳击手还要数詹姆·科贝特[206]。但是不论他怎样躲闪，终于还是被菲茨西蒙斯揍扁了。
<br> 
<br> 在格拉夫顿街，少年迪格纳穆瞥见一条装束如时的男人嘴里叼着红花，还有他穿的那条漂亮的长裤。他正在倾听着一个酒鬼的唠叨，一个劲儿地咧嘴笑着。
<br> 
<br> 没有驶往沙丘的电车。
<br> 
<br> 少年迪格纳穆将猪排换到另一只手里，沿着纳索街前行。他的领子又翘了起来，他使劲往下掖了掖。这讨厌的钮扣比衬衫上的扣眼小得多，所以才这么别扭。他碰见一群背书包的学童们。连明天我都不上学，一直缺课到星期一。他又遇到了另外一些学童。他们可曾理会我戴着孝？巴尼舅舅说，今儿晚上他就要登在报上。那么他们就统统可以在报上看到了。讣告上将印着我的名字，还有爹的。
<br> 
<br> 他的脸整个儿变成灰色的了，不像往日那样红润。一只苍蝇在上面爬，一直爬到眼睛上。在往棺材里拧螺丝的时候，只听到嘎吱嘎吱的响声。把棺材抬下楼梯的当儿，又发出咕咚咕咚的声音。
<br> 
<br> 爹躺在里面，而妈呢，在客厅里哭哪。巴尼舅舅正在关照抬棺的人怎样拐弯。老大一口棺材，高而且沉重。怎么搞的呢？最后那个晚上爹喝得醉醺醺的。他站在楼梯平台那儿，喊人给他拿靴子；他要到滕尼的店里去再灌上几杯。他只穿了件衬衫，看上去又矬又矮，像一只酒桶。可那以后就再也看不见他了。死亡就是这样的。爹死啦。我父亲死了。他嘱咐我要当妈的乖儿子。他还说了些旁的话，我没听清，可我看得出他的舌头和牙在试着把话说得清楚一些。可怜的爹。那就是迪格纳穆先生，我的父亲。但愿眼下他在炼狱里哪，因为星期六晚上他找康罗伊神父做过忏悔。
<br> 
<br> ＊ ＊ ＊
<br> 
<br> 达德利伯爵威廉·亨勃尔[207]和达德利夫人用完午膳，就在赫塞尔廷中校伴随下，从总督府乘车外出。跟随在后面的那辆马车里坐着尊贵的佩吉特太太、德库西小组和侍从副官尊贵的杰拉尔德·沃德。
<br> 
<br> 这支车队从凤凰公园南大门出来，一路受到卑恭屈膝的警察的敬礼。跨过国王桥[208] ，沿着北岸码头走去。总督经过这座大都会时，到处都受到极其热烈的欢迎。在血泊桥[209] 畔，托马斯·克南先生从河对岸徒劳地遥遥向他致敬。达德利爵爷的总督府车队打王后桥与惠特沃思桥[210] 之间穿行时，从法学学士、文学硕士达特利·怀特先生身边走过。此公却没向他致敬，只是伫立在阿伦街西角M. E. 怀特太太那爿当铺外面的阿伦码头上，用食指抚摩着鼻子。为了及早抵达菲布斯巴勒街，他拿不定主意究竟是该换三次电车呢，还是雇一辆马车；要么就步行，穿过史密斯菲尔德、宪法山和布洛德斯通终点站。在高等法院的门廊里，里奇·古尔丁正夹着古尔丁一科利斯一沃德律师事务所的帐目公文包，见到他有些吃惊。跨过里奇蒙桥之后，在爱国保险公司代理人吕便·杰·多德律师事务所门口台阶上，一位上了年纪的妇女正要走进去，却又改变了主意。她沿着王记商号的橱窗折回来，对国王陛下的代表投以轻信的微笑。伍德码头堤岸的水闸就在汤姆·德万事务所的下边，波德尔河从这里耷拉着一条效忠的污水舌头。在奥蒙德饭店的半截儿窗帘上端，褐色挨着金色；肯尼迪小姐的头挨着杜丝小姐的头，正一道儿在注视井欣赏着。在奥蒙德码头上，刚好从公共厕所走向副长官办事处的西蒙·迪达勒斯先生，就在街心止步，脱帽深打一躬。总督阁下谦和地向迪达勒斯先生还了礼。文学硕士休·C。洛夫神父从卡希尔印刷厂的拐角处施了一礼，总督却不曾理会。洛夫念念不忘的是：有俸圣职推举权从前都掌握在宽厚的代理国王的诸侯手中。在格拉但桥上，利内翰和麦科伊正在一边相互告别，一边望着马车经过。格蒂·麦克道维尔[211] 替她那缠绵病榻的父亲取来凯茨比公司关于软木亚麻油毡的函件，正走过罗杰·格林律师事务所和多拉德印刷厂的大红厂房。从那气派，她晓得那就是总督夫妇了，却看不到夫人究竟怎样打扮，因为一辆电车和斯普林家具店的一辆大型黄色家具搬运车给总督大人让道，刚好停在她跟前。伦迪·福特烟草店再过去，从卡瓦纳酒吧那被遮住的门口，约翰·怀斯·诺兰朝着国王陛下的代表、爱尔兰总督阁下淡然一笑，但是无人目睹到其神情之冷漠。维多利亚大十字勋章佩带者、达德利伯爵威廉·亨勃尔大人一路走过米基·安德森店里那众多嘀嘀嗒嗒响个不停的钟表，以及亨利- 詹姆斯那些衣着时髦、脸蛋儿鲜艳的蜡制模特儿——绅士亨利与最潇洒的詹姆斯。[212] 汤姆·罗赤福特和大鼻子弗林面对着戴姆大门，观看车队渐渐走近。汤姆·罗赤福特发现达德利夫人两眼盯着他，就连忙把插在紫红色背心兜里的两个大拇指伸出来，摘下便帽给她深打一躬。专演风骚角色的妩媚女演员——杰出的玛丽·肯德尔，脸颊上浓妆艳抹，撩起裙子，从海报上朝着达德利伯爵威廉·亨勃尔，也朝着H·G·赫塞尔廷中校，还朝着侍从副官、尊贵的杰拉尔德·沃德嫣然笑着。神色愉快的勃克·穆利根和表情严肃的海恩斯，隔着那些全神贯注的顾客们的肩膀，从都柏林面包公司的窗口定睛俯视着。簇拥在窗口的形影遮住了约翰·霍华德·巴涅尔的视线。而他正专心致志地注视着棋盘。在弗恩斯街上，迪丽·迪达勒斯从她那本夏登纳尔的《法语初级读本》抬起眼睛使劲往四下里望，一把把撑开来的遮阳伞以及在眩目的阳光下一些旋转着的车轱辘辐条映入眼帘。约翰·亨利·门侧堵在商业大厦门口，瞪着一双用酒浸大了般的牡蛎眼睛，肥肥的左手搽着一块厚实的双盖金表[213]，他并不看表，对它也无所察觉，在比利王的坐骑[214] 抬起前蹄抓挠虚空的地方，布林太太一把拽回她丈夫——他差点儿匆匆地冲到骑马侍从的马蹄底下。她对着他的耳朵大声把这消息嚷给他听。他明白了，于是就把那两本大书挪到左胸前，向第二辆马车致敬。这出乎侍从副官尊贵的杰拉尔德·沃德的意外，就赶忙欣然还礼。在庞森比书店的拐角处，精疲力竭的白色大肚酒瓶H站住了，四个戴高帽子的白色大肚酒瓶——E. L. Y’S[215] ，也在他身后停下脚步。骑在马上的侍从们拥着车辆，神气十足地打他们跟前奔驰而去。在皮戈特公司乐器栈房对面，舞蹈等课程的教师丹尼斯·杰·马金尼先生被总督赶在前头。后者却不曾理会他那花里胡哨的服装和端庄的步履。沿着学院院长住宅的围墙，布莱泽斯·博伊兰洋洋得意地踩着乐曲《我的意中人是位约克郡姑娘》[216]迭句的节拍走来。——他脚登棕黄色皮鞋，短袜跟上还绣着天蓝色的花纹。先导马缀着天蓝色额饰，一副趾高气扬的样子；布莱泽斯·博伊兰则向它们夸示自己这条天蓝色领带、这顶放荡地歪戴着的宽檐草帽和身上穿的这套靛青色哔叽衣服。他双手揣在上衣兜里，忘记行礼了，却向三位淑女大胆献出赞美的目光和他唇间所衔的那朵红花。当车队驶经纳索街的时候，总督大人提醒他那位正在点头还礼的伴侣去留意学院校园中正在演奏着的音乐节目。不见形影的高原小伙子们正肆无忌惮地[217] 用嘟嘟嘟的铜号声和咚咚咚的鼓声为车队行列送行：
<br> 
<br> 她虽是工厂姑娘，
<br> 
<br> 并不穿花哨衣裳，
<br> 
<br> 吧啦嘣。
<br> 
<br> 我以约克郡口味，
<br> 
<br> 对约克郡小玫瑰，
<br> 
<br> 倒怀有一种偏爱，
<br> 
<br> 吧啦嘣。
<br> 
<br> 围墙里面，四分之一英里平路障碍赛[218] 的参加者M. C.格林、H. 施里夫特、T. M. 帕蒂、C. 斯凯夫J．B杰夫斯、G. N. 莫菲、F. 斯蒂文森、C. 阿德利和w. C. 哈葛德开始了角逐。正跨着大步从芬恩饭店前经过的卡什尔·傅伊尔·奥康内尔·菲茨莫里斯·蒂斯代尔·法雷尔隔着单片眼镜射出来的凶恶目光，越过那些马车，凝视着奥匈帝国副领事馆窗内M. E. 所罗门斯[ 219] 先生那颗脑袋。在莱因斯特街深处，三一学院的后门旁边，保王派霍恩布洛尔手扶嗬嗬帽[220] 。当那些皮毛光润的马从梅里恩广场上奔驰而过的时候，等在那儿的少年帕特里克·阿洛伊修斯·迪格纳穆瞧见人们都向那位头戴大礼帽的绅士致敬，就也用自己那只被猪排包装纸弄得满是油腻的手，举起黑色新便帽。他的领子也翘了起来。为默塞尔医院募款的迈勒斯义卖会[221] 快要开始了，总督率领着随从们驰向下蒙特街，前往主持开幕式。他在布洛德本特那家店铺对面，从一个年轻盲人身边走过。在下蒙特街，一个身穿棕色胶布雨衣的行人[222] ，边啃着没有抹黄油的面包，边从总督的车马前面迅速地穿过马路，没磕也没碰着。在皇家运河桥头，广告牌上的尤金·斯特拉顿先生咧着厚厚嘴唇，对一切前来彭布罗克区[223]的人都笑脸相迎。在哈丁顿路口，两个浑身是沙子的女人停下脚步，手执雨伞和里面滚动着十一只蛤蜊的提包；她们倒要瞧瞧没挂金链条的市长[224] 大人和市长夫人是个啥样。在诺森伯兰和兰斯多恩两条路上，总督大人郑重其事地对那些向他致敬的人们一一回礼；其中包括稀稀拉拉的男性行人，站在一栋房子的花园门前的两个小学童——据说一八四九年已故女工[225] 偕丈夫前来访问爱尔兰首府时，这座房子承蒙她深表赞赏。还有被一扇正在关闭着的门所吞没的、穿着厚实长裤的阿尔米达诺·阿尔蒂弗尼的敬礼。
