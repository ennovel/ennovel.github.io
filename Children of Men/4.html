The moral of the story of Rosenstein is this: Woe be to the man who attempts to teach his wife a lesson! Woe be to him if he fail! Woe be to him if he succeed! Whatever happens, woe be to him! In witness whereof this tale is offered.
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Rosenstein wanted one room papered in red, and Mr. Rosenstein held that the yellow paper that adorned the walls was good enough for another year.
<br> 
<br> “But,” argued his wife, “we have laid by a little money in the past years, and we can easily afford it. And I love red paper on the walls.” Rosenstein, by the way, owned a dozen tenement houses, had no children, and led a life of strict economy on perhaps one-fiftieth of his income. Besides, Rosenstein owned a lucrative little dry-goods store that brought in more money. And he had never 52smoked and had never drunk. But the more his wife insisted upon the red paper the more stubborn he became in his opposition, until, one morning after a heated discussion in which he had failed disastrously to bring forth any reasonable argument to support his side of the case, he suddenly and viciously yielded.
<br> 
<br> “Very well,” he said, putting on his hat and starting for the door; “get your red paper. Have your own way. But from this moment forth I become a drinker.”
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Rosenstein turned pale. “Husband! Husband!” she cried entreatingly, turning toward him with clasped hands. But Rosenstein, without another word, strode out of the room and slammed the door behind him. Mrs. Rosenstein sank into a chair, appalled. The pride of her life had been that her husband had never touched liquor, and the one disquieting thought that from time to time came to worry her was that some day he might fall. And she felt that the first fall would mark the beginning of ruin. She had known men whose habits of drink had undermined their business capacity. Her husband, she knew, was close, and 53had a mania for accumulating money. But once the demon of drink entered into his life she felt that all this would change. He would become a spendthrift. He would squander all that he had saved. They would be homeless—perhaps they would starve. And he was about to take the first step. Her heart was almost broken. To follow him she knew would be worse than useless. He was stubborn—she had learned that—and there was nothing for her to do but to accept the inevitable.
<br> 
<br> Rosenstein meanwhile walked to the nearest saloon. He had passed the place a thousand times, but had never entered before. The bartender’s eyes opened in mild surprise to see so patriarchal a figure standing in front of the bar glaring at him so determinedly.
<br> 
<br> “Give me a drink!” demanded Rosenstein.
<br> 
<br> “What kind of a drink do you want?” asked the bartender.
<br> 
<br> Rosenstein looked bewildered. He did not know one drink from another. He looked at the row of bottles behind the counter, and then his face lit up.
<br> 
<br> 54“That bottle over there—the big black one.”
<br> 
<br> It was Benedictine. The bartender poured some of it into a tiny liqueur glass, but Rosenstein frowned.
<br> 
<br> “I want a drink, I said, not a drop. Fill me a big glass.”
<br> 
<br> The wise bartender does not dispute with his patrons as long as they have the means of paying for what they order. Without a word he filled a small goblet with the thick cordial, and Rosenstein, without a word, gulped it down. The bartender watched him in open-mouthed amazement, charged him for four drinks, and then, as Rosenstein walked haughtily out of the place, murmured to himself: “Well, I’ll be hanged!”
<br> 
<br> Rosenstein walked aimlessly but joyfully down the street, bowing to right and to left at the many people who smiled upon him in so friendly a fashion. When he came to the corner he was surprised to see that the whole character of the street had changed over night. Then it seemed to him that a regiment of soldiers came marching up, each man holding out a flowing bowl to him, that he fell into line and joined the march, and that 55they all found themselves in a brilliant, dazzling glare of several hundred suns. Then they shot him from the mouth of a cannon, and when he regained consciousness he recognised the features of Mrs. Rosenstein and felt the grateful coolness of the wet towels she was tenderly laying upon his fevered head. It was nearly midnight.
<br> 
<br> Rosenstein groaned in anguish.
<br> 
<br> “What has happened?” he asked.
<br> 
<br> “You have been a drinker,” his wife replied, “but it is all over now. Take a nice long sleep and we will never speak of it again. And the yellow paper will do for another year.”
<br> 
<br> Rosenstein watched the flaming pinwheels and skyrockets that were shooting before his vision for a while; then a horrible idea came to him.
<br> 
<br> “See how much money I have in my pockets,” he said. His wife counted it.
<br> 
<br> “One dollar and forty cents,” she said. A sigh of relief rose from Rosenstein’s lips.
<br> 
<br> “It’s all right, then. I only had two dollars when I went out.” Then he fell peacefully asleep. The next morning he faced his wife and pointed out to her the awful lesson he had taught her.
<br> 
<br> 56“You now see what your stubbornness can drive me to,” he said. “I have squandered sixty cents and lost a whole day’s work in the store merely to convince you that it is all nonsense to put red paper on the walls.” But his wife was clinging to him and crying and vowing that she would never again insist upon anything that would add to their expenses. And then they kissed and made up, and Rosenstein went to his store, somewhat weak in the legs and somewhat dizzy, and with a queer feeling in his head, but elated that he had won a complete mastery over his stubborn spouse so cheaply.
<br> 
<br> The store was closed.
<br> 
<br> Rosenstein gazed blankly at the barred door and windows. It was the bookkeeper’s duty to arrive at eight o’clock and open the store. It was now nine o’clock. Where was the bookkeeper? And where were the three saleswomen? And the office-boy? As quickly as he could, Rosenstein walked to the bookkeeper’s house. He found that young man dressing himself and whistling cheerfully. The bookkeeper looked amazed when he beheld his employer.
<br> 
<br> 57“What is the meaning of this?” demanded Rosenstein. “Why are you not at the store? Where are the keys?”
<br> 
<br> The young man’s face fell. He looked at Rosenstein curiously. Then, “Were you only joking?” he asked.
<br> 
<br> “Joking?” repeated Rosenstein, more amazed than ever. “Me? How? When? Are you crazy?”
<br> 
<br> “You told us all yesterday to close the store and go and have a good time, and that we needn’t come back for a week.”
<br> 
<br> Rosenstein steadied himself against the door. He tried to speak, but something was choking him. Finally, pointing to his breast, he managed to gasp faintly:
<br> 
<br> “Me?”
<br> 
<br> The clerk nodded.
<br> 
<br> “And what else did I do?” asked Rosenstein, timidly.
<br> 
<br> “You gave us each five dollars and—and asked us to sing something and—what is it, Mr. Rosenstein. Are you ill?”
<br> 
<br> “Go—go!” gasped Rosenstein. “Get everybody 58and open the store again. Quickly. And tell them all not to speak of what happened yesterday. They—they—can—they can (gulp) keep the money. But the store must be opened and nobody must tell.”
<br> 
<br> He staggered out into the street. A policeman saw him clutching a lamp-post to steady himself.
<br> 
<br> “Are you sick, Mr. Rosenstein?” he asked. “You look pale. Can’t I get you a drink?”
<br> 
<br> Rosenstein recoiled in horror. “I am not a drinker!” he cried. Then he walked off, his head in a whirl, his heart sick with a sudden dread. He took a long walk, and when he felt that he had regained control of himself he returned to the store. It was open, and everything was going on as usual. And there was a man—a stranger—waiting for him. When he beheld Rosenstein the stranger’s face lit up.
<br> 
<br> “Good-morning!” he cried, cheerfully. “Sorry to trouble you so early, but this is rent day, and I need the money.”
<br> 
<br> Rosenstein turned pale. The saleswomen had turned their heads away with a discretion that was 59painfully apparent. Rosenstein’s eyes blinked rapidly several times. Then he said, huskily, “What money?”
<br> 
<br> The stranger looked at him in surprise.
<br> 
<br> “Don’t you remember this?” he asked, holding out a card. Rosenstein looked at him.
<br> 
<br> “Yes, this is my card. But what of it?”
<br> 
<br> “Look on the other side.” Rosenstein looked. Staring him in the face was: “I owe Mister Casey thirty-six dollars. I. Rosenstein.” The writing was undeniably his. And suddenly there came to him a dim, distant, dreamlike recollection of standing upon a mountain-top with a band of music playing around him and a Mr. Casey handing him some money.
<br> 
<br> “I thought that was an old dream,” he muttered to himself. Then, turning to the stranger, he asked, “Who are you?”
<br> 
<br> “Me?” said the stranger, in surprise; “why, I’m Casey—T. Casey, of Casey’s café. You told me to come as soon as I needed the——”
<br> 
<br> “Hush!” cried Rosenstein. “Never mind any more.” He opened a safe, took out the money, and paid Mr. Casey. When the latter had gone 60Rosenstein called the bookkeeper aside, and, in a fearful tone, whispered in his ear:
<br> 
<br> “Ach! I am so glad when I think that I didn’t, open the safe yesterday.” The bookkeeper looked at him in surprise.
<br> 
<br> “You tried, sir,” he said. “Don’t you remember when you said, ‘The numbers won’t stand still,’ and asked me if I couldn’t open it? And I told you I didn’t know the combination?”
<br> 
<br> Rosenstein gazed upon him in horror. The room became close. He went out and stood in the doorway, gasping for breath. In the street, directly in front of the store, stood a white horse. A seedy-looking individual stood on the curb holding the halter and gazing expectantly at Rosenstein.
<br> 
<br> “Good-morning, boss!” he cried, cheerfully.
<br> 
<br> Rosenstein glared at him. “Go away!” he cried. “I don’t allow horses to stand in front of my store. Take him somewhere else.”
<br> 
<br> “I’ll take him anywhere ye say, boss,” said the man, touching his cap. “But ye haven’t paid for him yet.”
<br> 
<br> Rosenstein’s heart sank. Then suddenly a wave 61of bitter resentment surged through him. He strode determinedly toward the man.
<br> 
<br> “Did I buy that horse?” he asked, fiercely.
<br> 
<br> “Sure ye did,” answered the man; “for yer milk store.”
<br> 
<br> “But I haven’t got a milk store,” answered Rosenstein. The man’s eyes blinked.
<br> 
<br> “Don’t I know it?” he cried. “Didn’t ye tell me so yerself? But didn’t ye say ye wuz going to start one? Didn’t ye say that this horse was as white as milk, and that if I’d sell him to ye y’d open a milk store? Didn’t ye make me take him out of me wagon and run him up and down the street fer ye? Didn’t ye make me take all the kids on the block fer a ride? Am I a liar? Huh?”
<br> 
<br> Rosenstein walked unsteadily into the store and threw his arm around the bookkeeper’s neck.
<br> 
<br> “Get rid of him. For God’s sake get him away from here! Give him some money—as little as you can. Only get him away. Some day I will increase your salary. I am sick to-day. I cannot do any business. I am going home.” He started for the rear door, but stopped at the threshold.
<br> 
<br> 62“Don’t take the horse, whatever you do,” he said. Then he went home.
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Rosenstein was sitting on the doorsteps knitting and beaming with joy. When she saw her husband she ran toward him. The tears stood in her eyes.
<br> 
<br> “Dearest husband! Dear, generous husband! To punish me for my stubbornness and then to fill me with happiness by gratifying the dearest wish of my heart! It is too much! I do not deserve it! One room is all I wanted!”
<br> 
<br> Rosenstein’s heart nearly stopped beating. Upon his ears fell a strange noise of scraping and tearing that came from the doorway of his house.
<br> 
<br> “Wh-wh-what is it?” he asked, feebly. His wife smiled.
<br> 
<br> “The paper-hangers are already at work,” she said, joyfully. “They said you insisted that all the work should be finished in one day, and they’ve sent twenty men here.”
<br> 
<br> Mr. Rosenstein sank wearily down upon the steps. The power of speech had left him. Likewise the power of thought. His brain felt like a maelstrom of chaotic, incoherent images. He 63felt that he was losing his mind. A brisk-looking young man, with a roll of red wall-paper in his hand, came down the steps and doffed his hat to Rosenstein.
<br> 
<br> “Good-morning!” he cried, cheerfully. (The salutation “Good-morning” was beginning to go through Rosenstein like a knife each time he heard it.) “I did it. I didn’t think I could do it, but I did. I tell you, sir, there isn’t another paper-hanger in the city who could fill a job like that at such short notice. Every single room in the house! And red paper, too, which has to be handled so carefully, and makes the work take so much longer. But the job will be finished to-night, sir.”
<br> 
<br> He walked off with the light tread and proud mien of a man who has accomplished something. Rosenstein looked after him bewildered. Then he turned to his wife, but when he saw the smile and the happy look that lit up her face he turned away and sighed. How could he tell her?
<br> 
<br> “My love,” said Mrs. Rosenstein, after a long pause, “promise me one thing and I will be happy as long as I live.”
<br> 
<br> Rosenstein was silent. In a vague way he was 64wondering if this promise was based upon some deed of yesterday that had not yet been revealed to him.
<br> 
<br> “Promise me,” his wife went on, “that, no matter what happens, you will never become a drinker again.”
<br> 
<br> Rosenstein sat bolt upright. He tried to speak. A hundred different words and phrases crowded to his lips, struggling for utterance. He became purple with suppressed excitement. In a wild endeavour to utter that promise so forcibly, so emphatically, and so fiercely as not only to assure his wife, but to relieve his suffering feelings, Rosenstein could only sputter incoherently. Then, suddenly realising the futility of the endeavour, and feeling that his whole vocabulary was inadequate to express the vehemence of his emotion, he gurgled helplessly:
<br> 
<br> “Yes. I promise.”
<br> 
<br> And he kept the promise.
