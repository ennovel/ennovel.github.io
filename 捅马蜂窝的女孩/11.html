He had to meet Idris Ghidi in G?teborg. The question was how to travel there without being observed or leaving a trail. He decided against the train, since he did not want to use a credit card. Normally he would borrow Berger’s car, but that was no longer possible. He had thought about asking Cortez or someone else to rent a car for him, but that too would leave a trace. Finally he lit upon the obvious solution. He withdrew cash from an A.T.M. on G?tgatan. He had Salander’s keys to her burgundy Honda. It had been parked outside her building since March. He adjusted the seat and saw that the petrol tank was half full. Then he backed out and headed across Liljeholmsbron towards the E4. At 2.50 he parked on a side street off Avenyn in G?teborg. He had a late lunch at the first café he saw. At 4.10 he took the tram to Angered and got off in the centre of town. It took twenty minutes to find the address where Idris Ghidi lived. He was about ten minutes late for their meeting. Ghidi opened the door, shook hands with Blomkvist, and invited him into a living room with spartan furnishings. He had a limp. He asked Blomkvist to take a seat at the table next to a dresser on which were a dozen framed photographs, which Blomkvist studied. “My family,” Ghidi said. He spoke with a thick accent. Blomkvist suspected that he would not pass the language test recommended by the People’s Party of Sweden. “Are those your brothers?” “My two brothers on the left who were murdered by Saddam in the ’80s. That’s my father in the middle. My two uncles were murdered by Saddam in the ’90s. My mother died in 2000. My three sisters are still alive. Two are in Syria and my little sister is in Madrid.” Ghidi poured Turkish coffee. “Kurdo Baksi sends his greetings.” “Kurdo said you wanted to hire me for a job, but not what it was. I have to tell you, right away, that I won’t take the job if it’s illegal. I don’t dare get mixed up in anything like that.” “There is nothing illegal in what I am going to ask you to do. But it is unusual. The job itself will last for a couple of weeks. It must be done each day, but it will take only a minute of your time. For this I’m willing to pay you a thousand kronor a week. You will be paid by me, and I won’t report it to the tax authorities.” “I understand. What is it I have to do?” “One of your jobs at Sahlgrenska hospital – six days a week, if I understood correctly – is to clean corridor 11C, the intensive care unit.” Ghidi nodded. “This is what I want you to do.” Blomkvist leaned forward and explained his plan. Prosecutor Ekstr?m took stock of his visitor. It was the third time he had met Superintendent Nystr?m. He saw a lined face framed by short grey hair. Nystr?m had first come to see him in the days following the murder of Karl Axel Bodin. He had offered credentials to indicate that he worked for S.I.S. They had had a long, subdued conversation. “It’s important that you understand this: in no way am I trying to influence how you might act or how you do your job. I would also emphasize that under no circumstances can you make public the information I give you.” Nystr?m said. “I understand.” If truth be told, Ekstr?m did not entirely understand, but he did not want to seem very unclever by asking questions. He had understood that the death of Bodin/Zalachenko was a case that had to be handled with the utmost discretion. He had also understood that Nystr?m’s visit was off the record, although endorsed by the highest authorities within the Security Police. “This is most assuredly a matter of life or death,” Nystr?m had said at their very first meeting. “As far as the Security Police are concerned, everything related to the Zalachenko case is Top Secret. I can tell you that he is a defector, a former agent of Soviet military intelligence, and a key player in the Russians’ offensive against western Europe in the ’70s.” “That’s what Blomkvist at Millennium is evidently alleging.” “And in this instance Blomkvist is quite correct. He’s a journalist who happened to stumble upon one of the most secret operations ever conducted by Swedish defence.” “He’s going to publish the information.” “Of course. He represents the media, with all the advantages and drawbacks. We live in a democracy and naturally we cannot influence what is written in the press. The problem in this case is that Blomkvist knows only a fraction of the truth about Zalachenko, and much of what he thinks he knows is wrong.” “I see.” “What Blomkvist doesn’t grasp is that if the truth about Zalachenko comes out, the Russians will swiftly identify our informants and sources in Russia. People who have risked their lives for democracy will be in danger of being killed.” “But isn’t Russia a democracy now too? I mean, if this had been during the communist days—” “That’s an illusion. This is about people who spied formerly within the Soviet Union – no regime in the world would stand for that, even if it happened many years ago. And a number of these sources are still active.” No such agents existed, but Ekstr?m could not know that. He was bound to take Nystr?m at his word. And he could not help feeling flattered that he was being given information – off the record, of course – that was among the most secret to be found in Sweden. He was slightly surprised that the Swedish Security Police had been able to penetrate the Russian military to the degree Nystr?m was describing, and he perfectly understood that this was, of course, information that absolutely could not be disseminated. “When I was assigned to make contact with you, we did an extensive investigation of your background,” Nystr?m said. The seduction always involved discovering someone’s weaknesses. Prosecutor Ekstr?m’s weakness was his conviction as to his own importance. He was like everyone else, he appreciated flattery. The trick was to make him feel that he had been specially chosen. “And we have been able to satisfy ourselves that you are a man who enjoys enormous respect within the police force … and of course in government circles.” Ekstr?m looked pleased. That unnamed individuals in government circles had great confidence in him implied that he could count on their gratitude if he played his cards right. “Simply stated, my assignment is to provide you with background as necessary, and as discreetly as possible. You must understand how improbably complicated this story has become. For one thing, a preliminary investigation is under way, for which you bear the primary responsibility. No-one – not in the government or in the Security Police or anywhere else – can interfere in how you run this investigation. Your job is to ascertain the truth and bring the guilty parties to court. One of the most crucial functions in a democratic state.” Ekstr?m nodded. “It would be a national catastrophe if the whole truth about Zalachenko were to leak out.” “So what exactly is the purpose of your visit?” “First, to make you aware of the sensitive nature of the situation. I don’t think Sweden has been in such an exposed position since the end of the Second World War. One might say that, to a certain extent, the fate of Sweden rests in your hands.” “And who is your superior?” “I regret it, but I cannot reveal the name of anyone working on this case. But I can say that my instructions come from the very highest levels.” Good Lord. He’s acting on orders from the government. But he can’t say without unleashing a political firestorm. Nystr?m saw that Ekstr?m had swallowed the bait. “What I am able to do, however, is to provide you with information. I have been given the authority to use my own judgement in giving you sight of material that is, some of it, the most highly classified in this country.” “I see.” “This means that if you have questions about something, whatever it may be, then you should turn to me. You must not talk to anyone else in the Security Police, only to me. My assignment is to be your guide in this labyrinth, and if clashes between various interests threaten to arise, then we will assist each other in finding solutions.” “I understand. In that case I should say how grateful I am that you and your colleagues are willing to facilitate matters for me.” “We want the legal process to take its course even though this is a difficult situation.” “Good. I assure you that I will exercise the utmost discretion. This isn’t the first time I’ve handled Top Secret information, after all.” “No, we are quite aware of that.” Ekstr?m had a dozen questions that Nystr?m meticulously noted, and then answered as best he could. On this third visit Ekstr?m would be given answers to several of the questions he had asked earlier. Among them, and most crucially: what was the truth surrounding Bj?rck’s report from 1991? “That is a serious matter.” Nystr?m adopted a concerned expression. “Since this report surfaced, we have had an analysis group working almost round the clock to discover exactly what happened. We are now close to the point where we can draw conclusions. And they are most unpleasant.” “I can well imagine. That report alleges that the Security Police and the psychiatrist Peter Teleborian co-operated to place Lisbeth Salander in psychiatric care.” “If only that were the case,” Nystr?m said with a slight smile. “I don’t understand.” “If that was all there was to it, the matter would be simple. Then a crime would have been committed and led to a prosecution. The difficulty is that this report does not correspond with other reports that we have in our archives.” Nystr?m took out a blue folder and opened it. “What I have here is the report that Gunnar Bj?rck actually wrote in 1991. Here too are the original documents from the correspondence between him and Teleborian. The two versions do not agree.” “Please explain.” “The appalling thing is that Bj?rck has hanged himself. Presumably because of the threat of revelations about his sexual deviations. Blomkvist’s magazine was intending to expose him. That drove him to such depths of despair that he took his own life.” “Well …” “The original report is an account of Lisbeth Salander’s attempt to murder her father, Alexander Zalachenko, with a petrol bomb. The first thirty pages of the report that Blomkvist discovered agree with the original. These pages, frankly, contain nothing remarkable. It’s not until page thirty-three, where Bj?rck draws conclusions and makes recommendations, that the discrepancy arises.” “What discrepancy?” “In the original version Bj?rck presents five well-argued recommendations. We don’t need to hide the fact that they concern playing down the Zalachenko affair in the media and so forth. Bj?rck proposes that Zalachenko’s rehabilitation – he suffered very severe burns – be carried out abroad. And things similar. He also recommends that Salander should be offered the best conceivable psychiatric care.” “I see …” “The problem is that a number of sentences were altered in a very subtle way. On page thirty-four there is a paragraph in which Bj?rck appears to suggest that Salander be branded psychotic, so that she will not be believed if anyone should start asking questions about Zalachenko.” “And this suggestion is not in the original report.” “Precisely. Gunnar Bj?rck’s own report never suggested anything of the kind. Quite apart from anything else, that would have been against the law. He warmly recommended that she be given the care she quite clearly needed. In Blomkvist’s copy, this was made out to be a conspiracy.” “Could I read the original?” “Certainly you can. I have to take the report with me when I go. And before you read it, let me direct your attention to the appendix containing the subsequent correspondence between Bj?rck and Teleborian. It is almost entirely fabricated. Here it’s not a matter of subtle alterations, but of gross falsifications.” “Falsifications?” “I think that’s the only appropriate description. The original shows that Peter Teleborian was assigned by the district court to do a forensic psychiatric examination of Lisbeth Salander. Nothing out of the ordinary there. Salander was twelve years old and had tried to kill her father – it would have been very strange if that shocking event had not resulted in a psychiatric report.” “That’s true.” “If you had been the prosecutor, I assume that you would have insisted on both social and psychiatric investigations.” “Of course.” “Even then Teleborian was a well-respected child psychiatrist who had also worked in forensic medicine. He was given the assignment, conducted a normal investigation, and came to the conclusion that the girl was mentally ill. I don’t have to use their technical terms.” “No, no …” “Teleborian wrote this in a report that he sent to Bj?rck. The report was then given to the district court, which decided that Salander should be cared for at St Stefan’s. Blomkvist’s version is missing the entire investigation conducted by Teleborian. In its place is an exchange between Bj?rck and Teleborian, which has Bj?rck instructing Teleborian to falsify a mental examination.” “And you’re saying that it’s an invention, a forgery?” “No question about it.” “But who would be interested in creating such a thing?” Nystr?m put down the report and frowned. “Now you’re getting to the heart of the problem.” “And the answer is …?” “We don’t know. That’s the question our analytical group is working very hard to answer.” “Could it be that Blomkvist made some of it up?” Nystr?m laughed. “That was one of our first thoughts too. But we don’t think so. We incline to the view that the falsification was done a long time ago, presumably more or less simultaneously with the writing of the original report. And that leads to one or two disagreeable conclusions. Whoever did the falsification was extremely well informed. In addition, whoever did it had access to the very typewriter that Bj?rck used.” “You mean …” “We don’t know where Bj?rck wrote the report. It could have been at his home or at his office or somewhere else altogether. We can imagine two alternatives. Either the person who did the falsification was someone in the psychiatric or forensic medicine departments, who for some reason wanted to involve Teleborian in a scandal. Or else the falsification was done for a completely different purpose by someone inside the Security Police.” “For what possible reason?” “This happened in 1991. There could have been a Russian agent inside S.I.S. who had picked up Zalachenko’s trail. Right now we’re examining a large number of old personnel files.” “But if the K.G.B. had found out … then it should have leaked years ago.” “You’re right. But don’t forget that this was during the period when the Soviet Union was collapsing and the K.G.B. was dissolved. We have no idea what went wrong. Maybe it was a planned operation that was shelved. The K.G.B. were masters of forgery and disinformation.” “But why would the K.G.B. want to plant such a forgery?” “We don’t know that either. But the most obvious purpose would have been to involve the Swedish government in a scandal.” Ekstr?m pinched his lip. “So what you’re saying is that the medical assessment of Salander is correct?” “Oh yes. Salander is, to put it in colloquial terms, stark raving mad. No doubt about that. The decision to commit her to an institution was absolutely correct.” “Toilets?” Eriksson sounded as if she thought Cortez was pulling her leg. “Toilets,” Cortez repeated. “You want to run a story on toilets? In Millennium?” Eriksson could not help laughing. She had observed his ill-concealed enthusiasm when he sauntered into the Friday meeting, and she recognized all the signs of a reporter who had a story in the works. “Explain.” “It’s really quite simple,” Cortez said. “The biggest industry in Sweden by far is construction. It’s an industry that in practice cannot be outsourced overseas, even if Skanska Construction opens an office in London and stuff like that. No matter what, the houses have to be built in Sweden.” “But that’s nothing new.” “No, but what is new is that the construction industry is a couple of light-years ahead of all other Swedish industries when it comes to competition and efficiency. If Volvo built cars the same way, the latest model would cost about one, maybe even two million kronor. For most of industry, cutting prices is the constant challenge. For the construction industry it’s the opposite. The price per square metre keeps going up. The state subsidizes the cost with taxpayers’ money just so that the prices aren’t prohibitive.” “Is there a story in that?” “Wait. It’s complicated. Let’s say the price curve for hamburgers had been the same since the ’70s – so a Big Mac would cost about 150 kronor or more. I don’t want to guess what it would cost with fries and a Coke, but my salary at Millennium might not cover it. How many people around this table would go to McDonald’s and buy a burger for 100 kronor?” Nobody said a word. “Understandable. But when N.C.C. bangs together some sheet-metal cubes for exclusive rental at G?shaga on Liding?, they ask 10– 12,000 kronor a month for a three-cube apartment. How many of you are paying that much?” “I couldn’t afford it,” Nilsson said. “No, of course not. But you already live in a one-bedroom apartment by Danvikstull which your father bought for you twenty years ago, and if you were to sell it you’d probably get a million and a half for it. But what does a twenty-year-old do who wants to move out of the family home? They can’t afford to. So they sublet or sub-sublet or they live at home with their mothers until they retire.” “So where do the toilets come into the picture?” Malm said. “I’m getting to that. The question is, why are apartments so bloody expensive? Because the people commissioning the buildings don’t know how to set the price. To put it simply, a developer calls up Skanska Construction and says that they want a hundred apartments and asks what it will cost. And Skanska calculates it and comes back and says it’ll cost around 500 million kronor. Which means that the price per square metre will be X kronor and it would cost 10,000 a month if you wanted to move in. But unlike the McDonald’s example, you don’t really have a choice – you have to live somewhere. So you have to pay the going rate.” “Henry, dear … please get to the point.” “But that is the point. Why should it cost 10,000 a month to live in those crappy dumps in Hammarbyhamnen? Because the construction companies don’t give a damn about keeping prices down. The customer’s going to have to pay, come what may. One of the big costs is building materials. The trade in building materials goes through wholesalers who set their own prices. Since there isn’t any real competition there, a bathtub retails at 5,000 kronor in Sweden. The same bathtub from the same manufacturer retails at 2,000 kronor in Germany. There is no added cost that can satisfactorily explain the price difference.” There was impatient muttering around the table. “You can read about a lot of this in a report from the government’s Construction Cost Delegation, which was active in the late ’90s. Since then not much has happened. No-one is talking to the construction companies about the unreasonable prices. The buyers cheerfully pay what they are told it costs, and in the end the price burden falls on the renters or the taxpayers.” “Henry, the toilets?” “The little that has changed since the Construction Cost Delegation’s report has happened at the local level, and primarily outside Stockholm. There are buyers who got fed up with the high construction prices. One example is Karlskrona Homes, which builds houses less expensively than anyone else by buying the materials themselves. And Svensk Handel has also got into the game. They think that the price of construction materials is absurd, so they’ve been trying to make it easier for companies to buy less expensive products that are equally good. And that led to a little clash at the Construction Fair in ?lvsj? last year. Svensk Handel had brought in a man from Thailand who was selling toilets for 500 kronor apiece.” “And what happened?” “His nearest competitor was a Swedish wholesale outfit called Vitavara Inc., which sells genuine Swedish toilets for 1700 kronor apiece. And shrewd municipal buyers started to scratch their heads and wonder why they were shelling out 1700 kronor when they could get a similar toilet from Thailand for 500.” “Better quality maybe,” Karim said. “No. The exact same.” “Thailand,” Malm said. “That sounds like child labour and stuff like that. Which could explain the low price.” “Not so,” Cortez said. “Child labour exists mostly in the textile and souvenir industries in Thailand. And the paedophile industry, of course. The United Nations keeps an eye on child labour, and I’ve checked out this company. They’re a reputable manufacturer. It’s a big, modern, respectable operation producing appliances and plumbing goods.” “Alright … but we’re talking about low-wage countries, and that means that you risk writing an article proposing that Swedish industry should be outbid by Thai industry. Fire the Swedish workers and close the factories here, and import everything from Thailand. You won’t win any points with the Trades Union Federation.” A smile spread over Cortez’s face. He leaned back and looked ridiculously pleased with himself. “No again,” he said. “Guess where Vitavara Inc. makes its toilets to sell at 1700 kronor apiece?” Silence fell over the room. “Vietnam,” Cortez said. “You’ve got to be kidding,” Eriksson said. “They’ve been making toilets there for at least ten years. Swedish workers were already out of that race in the ’90s.” “Oh, shit.” “But here comes my point. If you imported directly from the factory in Vietnam, the price would be in the order of 390 kronor. Guess how you can explain the price difference between Thailand and Vietnam?” “Don’t tell me that—” “Oh, yes. Vitavara Inc. subcontracts the work to an outfit called Fong Soo Industries. They’re on the U.N. list of companies that use child labour, at least they were in an investigation from 2001. But the majority of the workers are convicts.” Eriksson burst out laughing. “This is great. This is really great. I’m sure you’re going to be a journalist when you grow up. How fast can you have the story ready?” “Two weeks. I have a lot of international trade stuff to check out. And then we need a bad guy for the story, so I’m going to see who owns Vitavara Inc.” “Then we could run it in the June issue?” “No problem.” Inspector Bublanski listened to Prosecutor Ekstr?m without expression. The meeting had lasted forty minutes, and Bublanski was feeling an intense desire to reach out and grab the copy of The Law of the Swedish Kingdom that lay on the edge of Ekstr?m’s desk and ram it into the prosecutor’s face. He wondered what would happen if he acted on his impulse. There would certainly be headlines in the evening papers and it would probably result in an assault charge. He pushed the thought away. The whole point of the socialized human being was to not give in to that sort of impulse, regardless of how belligerently an opponent might behave. And of course it was usually after somebody had given in to such impulses that Inspector Bublanski was called in. “I take it that we’re in agreement,” Ekstr?m said. “No, we are not in agreement,” Bublanski said, getting to his feet. “But you’re the leader of the preliminary investigation.” He muttered to himself as he turned down the corridor to his office, summoning Andersson and Modig as he went. They were the only colleagues available to him that afternoon as Holmberg had regrettably opted to take a two-week holiday. “My office,” Bublanski said. “Bring some coffee.” After they had settled in, Bublanski looked at the notes from his meeting with Ekstr?m. “As the situation stands, our preliminary investigation leader has dropped all charges against Lisbeth Salander relating to the murders for which she was being sought. She is no longer part of the preliminary investigation so far as we’re concerned.” “That can be considered a step forward, at any rate,” Modig said. Andersson, as usual, said nothing. “I’m not so sure about that,” Bublanski said. “Salander is still suspected of G.B.H. in connection with the events at Stallarholmen and Gosseberga. But we’re no longer involved with those investigations. We have to concentrate on finding Niedermann and working on the graves in the woods at Nykvarn. On the other hand it’s now clear that Ekstr?m is going to bring charges against Salander. The case has been transferred to Stockholm, and an entirely new investigation has been set up for the purpose.” “Oh, really?” Modig said. “And who do you think is going to investigate Salander?” Bublanski said. “I’m fearing the worst.” “Hans Faste is back on duty, and he’s going to assist Ekstr?m.” “That’s insane. Faste is grossly unsuited to investigate anything at all to do with Salander.” “I know that. But Ekstr?m has a good argument. Faste has been out sick since … hmm … he collapsed in April, and this would be the perfect, simple case for him to focus on.” Silence. “The long and the short of it is that we’re to hand all our material on Salander over to him this afternoon.” “And this story about Gunnar Bj?rck and S?po and the 1991 report …” “… is going to be handled by Faste and Ekstr?m.” “I don’t like this,” Modig said. “Nor do I. But Ekstr?m’s the boss, and he has backing from higher up in the bureaucracy. In other words, our job is still to find the killer. Curt, what’s the situation?” Andersson shook his head. “Niedermann seems to have been swallowed up by the earth. I have to admit that in all my years on the force I’ve never seen anything like it. We haven’t had any tip-offs, and we don’t have a single informer who knows him or has any idea where he might be.” “That sounds fishy,” Modig said. “But he’s being sought for the police murder in Gosseberga, for G.B.H on another officer, for the attempted murder of Salander, and for the aggravated kidnapping and assault of the dental nurse Anita Kaspersson, as well as for the murders of Svensson and Johansson. In every instance there’s good forensic evidence.” “That helps a bit, at least. How’s it going with the case of Svavelsj? M.C.’s treasurer?” “Viktor G?ransson – and his girlfriend, Lena Nygren. Fingerprints and D.N.A. from G?ransson’s body. Niedermann must have bloodied his knuckles pretty badly during the beating.” “Anything new on Svavelsj? M.C.?” “Nieminen has taken over as club president while Lundin remains in custody, awaiting trial for the kidnapping of Miriam Wu. There’s a whisper that Nieminen has offered a big reward to anyone who could provide information as to Niedermann’s whereabouts.” “Which makes it even stranger that he hasn’t been found, if the entire underworld is looking for him. What about G?ransson’s car?” “Since we found Kaspersson’s car at G?ransson’s place, we’re sure that Niedermann switched vehicles. But we have no trace of the car he took.” “So we have to ask ourselves, one, is Niedermann still hiding out somewhere in Sweden?; two, if so, with whom?; three, is he out of the country? What do we think?” “We have nothing to tell us that he has left the country, but really that seems his most logical course.” “If he has gone, where did he ditch the car?” Modig and Andersson shook their heads. Nine times out of ten, police work was largely uncomplicated when it came to looking for one specific individual. It was about initiating a logical sequence of inquiries. Who were his friends? Who had he been in prison with? Where does his girlfriend live? Who did he drink with? In what area was his mobile last used? Where is his vehicle? At the end of that sequence the fugitive would generally be found. The problem with Niedermann was that he had no friends, no girlfriend, no listed mobile, and he had never been in prison. The inquiries had concentrated on finding G?ransson’s car, which Niedermann was presumed to be using. They had expected the car to turn up in a matter of days, probably in some car park in Stockholm. But there was as yet no sign of it. “If he’s out of the country, where would he be?” “He’s a German citizen, so the obvious thing would be for him to head for Germany.” “He seems not to have had any contact with his old friends in Hamburg.” Andersson waved his hand. “If his plan was to go to Germany … Why would he drive to Stockholm? Shouldn’t he have made for Malm? and the bridge to Copenhagen, or for one of the ferries?” “I know. And Inspector Erlander in G?teborg has been focusing his search in that direction from day one. The Danish police have been informed about G?ransson’s car, and we know for sure that he didn’t take any of the ferries.” “But he did drive to Stockholm and to Svavelsj?, and there he murdered the club’s treasurer and – we may assume – went off with an unspecified sum of money. What would his next step be?” “He has to get out of Sweden,” Bublanski said. “The most obvious thing would be to take one of the ferries across the Baltic. But G?ransson and his girlfriend were murdered late on the night of April 9. Niedermann could have taken the ferry the next morning. We got the alarm roughly sixteen hours after they died, and we’ve had an A.P.B. out on the car ever since.” “If he took the morning ferry, then G?ransson’s car would have been parked at one of the ports,” Modig said. “Perhaps we haven’t found the car because Niedermann drove out of the country to the north via Haparanda? A big detour around the Gulf of Bothnia, but in sixteen hours he could have been in Finland.” “Sure, but soon after he would have had to abandon the car in Finland, and it should have been found by now.” They sat in silence. Finally Bublanski got up and stood at the window. “Could he have found a hiding place where he’s just lying low, a summer cabin or—” “I don’t think it would be a summer cabin. This time of year every cabin owner is out checking their property.” “And he wouldn’t try anywhere connected to Svavelsj? M.C. They’re the last people he’d want to run into.” “And the entire underworld should be excluded as well … Any girlfriend we don’t know about?” They could speculate, but they had no facts. When Andersson had left for the day, Modig went back to Bublanski’s office and knocked on the door jamb. He waved her in. “Have you got a couple of minutes?” she said. “What’s up?” “Salander. I don’t like this business with Ekstr?m and Faste and a new trial. You’ve read Bj?rck’s report. I’ve read Bj?rck’s report. Salander was unlawfully committed in 1991 and Ekstr?m knows it. What the hell is going on?” Bublanski took off his reading glasses and tucked them into his breast pocket. “I don’t know.” “Have you got any idea at all?” “Ekstr?m claims that Bj?rck’s report and the correspondence with Teleborian were falsified.” “That’s rubbish. If it were a fake, then Bj?rck would have said so when we brought him in.” “Ekstr?m says Bj?rck refused to discuss it, on the grounds that it was Top Secret. I was given a dressing down because I jumped the gun and brought him in.” “I’m beginning to have strong reservations about Ekstr?m.” “He’s getting squeezed from all sides.” “That’s no excuse.” “We don’t have a monopoly on the truth, Sonja. Ekstr?m says he’s received evidence that the report is a fake – that there is no real report with that protocol number. He also says that the forgery is a good one and that the content is a clever blend of truth and fantasy.” “Which part was truth and which part was fantasy, that’s what I need to know,” Modig said. “The outline story is pretty much correct. Zalachenko is Salander’s father, and he was a bastard who beat her mother. The problem is the familiar one – the mother never wanted to make a complaint so it went on for several years. Bj?rck was given the job of finding out what happened when Salander tried to kill her father. He corresponded with Teleborian – but the correspondence in the form we’ve seen it is apparently a forgery. Teleborian did a routine psychiatric examination of Salander and concluded that she was mentally unbalanced. A prosecutor decided not to take the case any further. She needed care, and she got it at St Stefan’s.” “And if it is a forgery … who did it and why?” Bublanski shrugged. As I understand it, Ekstr?m is going to commission one more thorough evaluation of Salander.” “I can’t accept that.” “It’s not our case any more.” “And Faste has replaced us. Jan, I’m going to the media if these bastards piss all over Salander one more time.” “No, Sonja. You won’t. First of all, we no longer have access to the report, so you have no way of backing up your claims. You’re going to look like a paranoid, and then your career will be over.” “I still have the report,” Modig said in a low voice. “I made a copy for Curt but I never had a chance to give it to him before the Prosecutor General collected the others.” “If you leak that report, you’ll not only be fired but you’ll be guilty of gross misconduct.” Modig sat in silence for a moment and looked at her superior. “Sonja, don’t do it. Promise me.” “No, Jan. I can’t promise that. There’s something very sick about this whole story.” “You’re right, it is sick. But since we don’t know who the enemy is, you’re not going to do anything for the moment.” Modig tilted her head to one side. “Are you going to do anything?” “I’m not going to discuss that with you. Trust me. It’s Friday night. Take a break, go home. And … this discussion never took place.” Niklas Adamsson, the Securitas guard, was studying for a test in three weeks’ time. It was 1.30 on Saturday afternoon when he heard the sound of rotating brushes from the low-humming floor polisher and saw that it was the dark-skinned immigrant who walked with a limp. The man would always nod politely but never laughed if he said anything humorous. Adamsson watched as he took a bottle of cleaning fluid and sprayed the reception counter-top twice before wiping it with a rag. Then he took his mop and swabbed the corners in the reception area where the brushes of the floor polisher could not reach. The guard put his nose back into his book about the national economy and kept reading. It took ten minutes for the cleaner to work his way over to Adamsson’s spot at the end of the corridor. They nodded to each other. Adamsson stood to let the man clean the floor around his chair outside Salander’s room. He had seen him almost every day since he had been posted outside the room, but he could not remember his name – some sort of foreign name – but Adamsson did not feel the need to check his I.D. For one thing, the nigger was not allowed to clean inside the prisoner’s room – that was done by two cleaning women in the morning – and besides, he did not feel that the cripple was any sort of threat. When the cleaner had finished in the corridor, he opened the door to the room next to Salander’s. Adamsson glanced his way, but this was no deviation from the daily routine. This was where the cleaning supplies were kept. In the course of the next five minutes he emptied his bucket, cleaned the brushes, and replenished the cart with plastic bags for the wastepaper baskets. Finally he manoeuvred the cart into the cubbyhole. Ghidi was aware of the guard in the corridor. It was a young blond man who was usually there two or three days a week, reading books. Part-time guard, and part-time student. He was about as aware of his surroundings as a brick. Ghidi wondered what Adamsson would do if someone actually tried to get into the Salander woman’s room. He also wondered what Blomkvist was really after. He had read about the eccentric journalist in the newspapers, and he had made the connection to the woman in 11C, expecting that he would be asked to smuggle something in for her. But he did not have access to her room and had never even seen her. Whatever he had expected, it was not this. He could not see anything illegal about his task. He looked through the crack in the doorway at Adamsson, who was once more reading his book. He checked that nobody else was in the corridor. He reached into the pocket of his smock and took out the Sony Ericsson Z600 mobile. Ghidi had seen in an advertisement that it cost around 3,500 kronor and had all the latest features. He took a screwdriver from his pocket, stood on tiptoe and unscrewed the three screws in the round white cover of a vent in the wall of Salander’s room. He pushed the telephone as far into the vent as he could, just as Blomkvist had asked him to. Then he screwed on the cover again. It took him forty-five seconds. The next day it would take less. He was supposed to get down the mobile, change the batteries and put it back in the vent. He would then take the used batteries home and recharge them overnight. That was all Ghidi had to do. But this was not going to be of any help to Salander. On her side of the wall there was presumably a similar screwed-on cover. She would never be able to get at the mobile, unless she had a screwdriver and a ladder. “I know that,” Blomkvist had said. “But she doesn’t have to reach the phone.” Ghidi was to do this every day until Blomkvist told him it was no longer necessary. And for this job Ghidi would be paid 1000 kronor a week, straight into his pocket. And he could keep the mobile when the job was over. He knew, of course, that Blomkvist was up to some sort of funny business, but he could not work out what it was. Putting a mobile telephone into an air vent inside a locked cleaning supplies room, turned on but not uplinked, was so crazy that Ghidi could not imagine what use it could be. If Blomkvist wanted a way of communicating with the patient, he would be better off bribing one of the nurses to smuggle the telephone in to her. On the other hand, he had no objection to doing Blomkvist this favour – a favour worth 1000 kronor a week. He was better off not asking any questions. Jonasson slowed his pace when he saw a man with a briefcase leaning on the wrought-iron gates outside his housing association apartment on Hagagatan. He looked somehow familiar. “Dr Jonasson?” he said. “Yes?” “Apologies for bothering you on the street outside your home. It’s just that I didn’t want to track you down at work, and I do need to talk to you.” “What’s this about, and who are you?” “My name is Blomkvist, Mikael Blomkvist. I’m a journalist and I work at Millennium magazine. It’s about Lisbeth Salander.” “Oh, now I recognize you. You were the one who called the paramedics. Was it you who put duct tape on her wounds?” “Yes.” “That was a smart thing to have done. But I don’t discuss my patients with journalists. You’ll have to speak to the P.R. department at Sahlgrenska, like everyone else.” “You misunderstand me. I don’t want information and I’m here in a completely private capacity. You don’t have to say a word or give me any information. Quite the opposite: I want to give you some information.” Jonasson frowned. “Please hear me out,” Blomkvist said. “I don’t go around accosting surgeons on the street, but what I have to tell you is very important. Can I buy you a cup of coffee?” “Tell me what it’s about.” “It’s about Lisbeth Salander’s future and wellbeing. I’m a friend.” Jonasson thought that if it had been anyone other than Blomkvist he would have refused. But Blomkvist was a man in the public eye, and Jonasson could not imagine that this would be some sort of tomfoolery. “I won’t under any circumstances be interviewed, and I won’t discuss my patient.” “Perfectly understood,” Blomkvist said. Jonasson accompanied Blomkvist to a café nearby. “So what’s this all about?” he said when they had got their coffee. “First of all, I’m not going to quote you or mention you even in anything I write. And as far as I’m concerned this conversation never took place. Which said, I am here to ask you a favour. But I have to explain why, so that you can decide whether you can or you can’t.” “I don’t like the sound of this.” “All I ask is that you hear me out. It’s your job to take care of Lisbeth’s physical and mental health. As her friend, it’s my job to do the same. I can’t poke around in her skull and extract bullets, but I have another skill that is as crucial to her welfare.” “Which is?” “I’m an investigative journalist, and I’ve found out the truth about what happened to her.” “O.K.” “I can tell you in general terms what it’s about and you can come to your own conclusions.” “Alright.” “I should also say that Annika Giannini, Lisbeth’s lawyer – you’ve met her I think – is my sister, and I’m the one paying her to defend Salander.” “I see.” “I can’t, obviously, ask Annika to do this favour. She doesn’t discuss Lisbeth with me. She has to keep her conversations with Lisbeth confidential. I assume you’ve read about Lisbeth in the newspapers.” Jonasson nodded. “She’s been described as a psychotic, and a mentally ill lesbian mass murderer. All that is nonsense. Lisbeth Salander is not psychotic. She may be as sane as you and me. And her sexual preferences are nobody’s business.” “If I’ve understood the matter correctly, there’s been some reassessment of the case. Now it’s this German who’s being sought in connection with the murders.” “To my certain knowledge, Niedermann is a murderer who has no grain of conscience. But Lisbeth has enemies. Big and nasty enemies. Some of these are in the Security Police.” Jonasson looked at Blomkvist in astonishment. “When Lisbeth was twelve, she was put in a children’s psychiatric clinic in Uppsala. Why? Because she had stirred up a secret that S?po was trying at any price to keep a lid on. Her father, Alexander Zalachenko – otherwise known as Karl Axel Bodin, who was murdered in your hospital – was a Soviet defector, a spy, a relic from the Cold War. He also beat up Lisbeth’s mother year after year. When Lisbeth was twelve, she hit back and threw a Molotov cocktail at him as he sat in his car. That was why she was locked up.” “I don’t understand. If she tried to kill her father, then surely there was good reason to take her in for psychiatric treatment.” “My story – which I am going to publish – is that S?po knew about Zalachenko the wife beater, they knew what had provoked Lisbeth to do what she did, but they chose to protect Zalachenko because he was a source of valuable information. So they faked a diagnosis to make sure that Lisbeth was committed.” Jonasson looked so sceptical that Blomkvist had to laugh. “I can document every detail. And I’m going to write a full account in time for Lisbeth’s trial. Believe me – it’s going to cause uproar. You might bear in mind that the beating that provoked Lisbeth’s attack put her mother in hospital for the rest of her life.” “O.K. Go on.” “I’m going to expose two doctors who were errand boys for S?po, and who helped bury Lisbeth in the asylum. I’m going to hang them out to dry. One of these is a well-known and respected person. But, as I said, I have all the documentation.” “If a doctor were mixed up in something like this, it’s a blot on the entire profession.” “I don’t believe in collective guilt. It concerns only those directly involved. The same is true of S?po. I don’t doubt that there are excellent people working in S?po. This is about a small group of conspirators. When Lisbeth was eighteen they tried to institutionalize her again. This time they failed, and she was instead put under guardianship. In the trial, whenever it is, they’re once again going to try to throw as much shit at her as they can. I – or rather, my sister Annika – will fight to see that she is acquitted, and that her still-extant declaration of incompetence is revoked.” “I see.” “But she needs ammunition. So that’s the background for this tactic. I should probably also mention that there are some individuals in the police force who are actually on Lisbeth’s side in all this. But not the prosecutor who brought the charges against her. In short, Lisbeth needs help before the trial.” “But I’m not a lawyer.” “No. But you’re Lisbeth’s doctor and you have access to her.” Jonasson’s eyes narrowed. “What I’m thinking of asking you is unethical, and it might also be illegal.” “Indeed?” “But morally it’s the right thing to do. Her constitutional rights are being violated by the very people who ought to be protecting her. Let me give you an example. Lisbeth is not allowed to have visitors, and she can’t read newspapers or communicate with the outside world. The prosecutor has also pushed through a prohibition of disclosure for her lawyer. Annika has obeyed the rules. However, the prosecutor himself is the primary source of leaks to the reporters who keep writing all the shit about Lisbeth.” “Is that really so?” “This story, for example.” Blomkvist held up a week-old evening newspaper. “A source within the investigation claims that Lisbeth is non compos mentis, which prompted the newspaper to speculate about her mental state.” “I read the article. It’s nonsense.” “So you don’t think she’s crazy.” “I won’t comment on that. But I do know that no psychiatric evaluations have been done. Accordingly, the article is nonsense.” “I can show you chapter and verse to prove that the person who leaked this information is a police officer called Hans Faste. He works for Prosecutor Ekstr?m.” “Oh.” “Ekstr?m is going to seek to have the trial take place behind closed doors, so that no outsider will have knowledge of or be able to weigh the evidence against Lisbeth. But what is worse … Because the prosecutor has isolated Lisbeth, she won’t be able to do the research she needs to do to prepare her defence.” “But isn’t that supposed to be done by her lawyer?” “As you must have gathered by now, Lisbeth is an extraordinary person. She has secrets I happen to know about, but I can’t reveal them to my sister. But Lisbeth should be able to choose whether she wants to make use of them in her trial.” “I see.” “And in order to do that, she needs this.” Blomkvist laid Salander’s Palm Tungsten T3 hand-held computer and a battery charger on the table between them. “This is the most important weapon Lisbeth has in her arsenal – she has to have it.” Jonasson looked suspiciously at the Palm. “Why not give it to her lawyer?” “Because Lisbeth is the only one who knows how to get at the evidence.” Jonasson sat for a while, still not touching the computer. “Let me tell you one or two things about Dr Peter Teleborian,” Blomkvist said, taking a folder from his briefcase. It was just after 8.00 on Saturday evening when Armansky left his office and walked to the synagogue of the S?der congregation on St Paulsgatan. He knocked on the door, introduced himself, and was admitted by the rabbi himself. “I have an appointment to meet someone I know here,” Armansky said. “One flight up. I’ll show you the way.” The rabbi offered him a kippa for his head, which Armansky hesitantly put on. He had been brought up in a Muslim family and he felt foolish wearing it. Bublanski was also wearing a kippa. “Hello, Dragan. Thanks for coming. I’ve borrowed a room from the rabbi so we can speak undisturbed.” Armansky sat down opposite Bublanski. “I presume you have good reason for such secrecy.” “I’m not going to spin this out: I know that you’re a friend of Salander’s.” Armansky nodded. “I need to know what you and Blomkvist have cooked up to help her.” “Why would we be cooking something up?” “Because Prosecutor Ekstr?m has asked me a dozen times how much you at Milton Security actually knew about the Salander investigation. It’s not a casual question – he’s concerned that you’re going to spring something that could result in repercussions … in the media.” “I see.” “And if Ekstr?m is worried, it’s because he knows or suspects that you’ve got something brewing. Or at least he’s talked to someone who has suspicions.” “Someone?” “Dragan, let’s not play games. You know Salander was the victim of an injustice in the early ’90s, and I’m afraid she’s going to get the same medicine when the trial begins.” “You’re a police officer in a democracy. If you have information to that effect you should take action.” Bublanski nodded. “I’m thinking of doing just that. The question is, how?” “Tell me what you want to know.” “I want to know what you and Blomkvist are up to. I assume you’re not just sitting there twiddling your thumbs.” “It’s complicated. How do I know I can trust you?” “There’s a report from 1991 that Blomkvist discovered …” “I know about it.” “I no longer have access to the report.” “Nor do I. The copies that Blomkvist and his sister – now Salander’s lawyer – had in their possession have both disappeared.” “Disappeared?” “Blomkvist’s copy was taken during a break-in at his apartment, and Giannini’s was stolen when she was mugged, punched to the ground in G?teborg. All this happened on the day Zalachenko was murdered.” Bublanski said nothing for a long while. “Why haven’t we heard anything about this?” “Blomkvist put it like this: there’s only one right time to publish a story, and an endless number of wrong times.” “But you two … he’ll publish it?” Armansky gave a curt nod. “A nasty attack in G?teborg and a break-in here in Stockholm. On the same day,” Bublanski said. “That means that our adversary is well organized.” “I should probably also mention that we know Giannini’s telephone is tapped.” “A whole bunch of crimes.” “The question is, whose?” “That’s what I’m wondering. Most likely it’s S?po – they would have an interest in suppressing Bj?rck’s report. But Dragan … we’re talking about the Swedish Security Police, a government agency. I can’t believe this would be something sanctioned by S?po. I don’t even believe S?po has the expertise to do anything like this.” “I’m having trouble digesting it myself. Not to mention that someone else saunters into Sahlgrenska and blows Zalachenko’s head off. And at the same time, Gunnar Bj?rck, author of the report, hangs himself.” “So you think there’s a single hand behind all this? I know Inspector Erlander, who did the investigation in G?teborg. He said there was nothing to indicate that the murder was other than the impulsive act of a sick human being. And we did a thorough investigation of Bj?rck’s place. Everything points towards a suicide.” “Gullberg, seventy-eight years old, suffering from cancer, recently treated for depression. Our operations chief Johan Fr?klund has been looking into his background.” “And?” “He did his military service in Karlskrona in the ’40s, studied law and eventually became a tax adviser. Had an office here in Stockholm for thirty years: low profile, private clients … whoever they might have been. Retired in 1991. Moved back to his home town of Laholm in 1994. Unremarkable, except—” “Except what?” “Except for one or two surprising details. Fr?klund cannot find a single reference to Gullberg anywhere. He’s never referred to in any newspaper or trade journal, and there’s no-one who can tell us who his clients were. It’s as if he never actually existed in the professional world.” “What are you saying?” “S?po is the obvious link. Zalachenko was a Soviet defector. Who else but S?po would have taken charge of him? Then the question of a co-ordinated strategy to get Salander locked away in an institution. Now we have burglaries, muggings and telephone tapping. Personally I don’t think S?po is behind this. Blomkvist calls them ‘the Zalachenko club’, a small group of dormant Cold-Warmongers who hide out in some dark corridor at S?po.” “So what should we do?” Bublanski said.</p>
