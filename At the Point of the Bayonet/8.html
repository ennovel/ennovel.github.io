Scindia more openly assumed supreme power, imprisoned several leading men, and transferred their jagheers to his own relations. Colonel Palmer had gone down to Bombay on leave, his place being filled temporarily by Mr. Uhtoff. 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Bajee was, as usual, playing a deep game. He desired to become independent both of Scindia and Nana Furnuwees. The former, he believed, must sooner or later return to his own dominions, and he desired his aid to get rid of Nana; therefore it was against the latter that his intrigues were, at present, directed. The minister was still an object of affection to his people; who believed, as before, in his goodness of character, and who put down every act of oppression as being the work of Scindia.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry saw Nana frequently. There being no change in the position, there was little talk of politics; and the minister generally turned the conversation upon England, its power relatively to that of France, the extent of its resources, the modes of life among the population, and its methods of government.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It all differs widely from ours," Nana said, after one of these conversations, "and in most respects is better. The changes there are made not by force, but by the will of the representatives of the people, in their assembly. A minister defeated there retires at once, and his chief opponent succeeds him. The army has no determining voice in the conduct of affairs, but is wholly under the orders of the minister who may happen to be in power. All this seems strange to us but, undoubtedly, the system is far better for the population. There is no bloodshed, no burning of villages, no plundering, no confiscation of estates. It is a change in the personnel of the government, but no change in the general course of affairs.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is strange that your soldiers fight so well when, as you tell me, they never carry arms until they enter the army; while ours are trained from childhood in the use of weapons. And your enemies, the French, is it the same with them?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is the same, Nana, so far as their civil life is concerned; for none carry weapons or are trained in their use. There is one wide point of difference. The French have to go as soldiers when they reach a certain age, however much they may dislike it; while with us there is no compulsion, whatever, and men enlist in the army just as they might take up any other trade. There is, however, a body called the militia. This, like the army, consists of volunteers; but is not liable for service abroad, and only goes out for a short period of training, annually. However, by law, should the supply of volunteers fall short, battalions can be kept at their full strength by men chosen by ballot from the population. But this is practically a dead letter, and I am told that the ballot is never resorted to; though doubtless it would be, in the case of a national emergency."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Ah! It is pleasant to be a minister in your country, with no fear of plots, of treachery, or assassination. Were I a younger man, I should like to visit England and stay there for a time so that, on my return, I could model some of our institutions upon yours.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But no; I fear that that would be too much for the most powerful minister to effect. The people are wedded to their old customs, and would not change them for others, however much these might be for their benefit. An order that none, save those in the army, should carry arms would unite the whole people against those who issued it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 It was on the last day of 1797 that Nana Furnuwees made a formal visit to Scindia, in return for one the latter had paid him, a few days before. Michel Filoze, a Neapolitan who commanded eight battalions in Scindia's army, had given his word of honour as a guarantee for the minister's safe return to his home. The European officers in the service of the Indian princes bore a high character, not only for their fidelity to those they served, but also for their honour in all their dealings and, though Nana would not have confided in an oath sworn by Scindia, he accepted that of Filoze without hesitation.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 On his arrival near Scindia's camp the traitor seized him and, with his battalions, attacked his retinue, amounting to about a thousand persons, among whom were many of his principal adherents. Some of these were killed, all of them stripped of their robes and ornaments. Parties of soldiers were immediately sent, by Ghatgay, to plunder the house of Nana and those of all his adherents.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry was in his room when he heard a sudden outburst of firing and, a minute or two later, Abdool ran in.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Scindia's men are in the town, sahib! They are attacking the houses of Nana's adherents. These are defending themselves as best they can. There is a general panic, for it is believed that the whole town will be looted."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Get your things together, Abdool. I will change my dress for that of a native soldier, and we will make for the Residency."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Shall we ride, sahib?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, we will leave the horses here. If we were to go on horseback, we might be taken for Nana's adherents trying to make their escape, and be shot down without any further question.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I felt misgivings when I saw Nana going out; but it would have come to the same thing, in the end, for if Scindia's whole army, villainous as is the treachery, had advanced against the town, Nana could have gathered no force to oppose them."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Three or four minutes later they started, Abdool carrying a bundle containing Harry's disguises. They made their way through lanes, where the people were all standing at their doors, talking excitedly. Continuous firing was heard in the direction of the better quarters, mingled with shouts and cries. No one questioned them, all being too anxious as to their own safety to think of anything else.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The Residency was half a mile from the town. There Mr. Uhtoff was standing at his door, and the men of his escort were all under arms. Harry had been in frequent communication with him, from the time that he had taken Colonel Palmer's place. The Resident did not, for the moment, recognize him in his new disguise but, when he did so, he asked anxiously what was going on in the town.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "A strong body of Scindia's troops are there, attacking Nana's adherents. I fear that the minister himself is a prisoner in their camp."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That is bad news, indeed. Nana told me, yesterday, that he intended to visit Scindia, and had received a guarantee for his safe return, from Filoze. I advised him not to go; but he said that he could confide, implicitly, in the honour of a European officer. I told him that the various European nations differed widely from each other; and that, although I would accept the word of honour of a British officer in Scindia's service, I would not take that of a Neapolitan. However, he said, and said truly, that it was incumbent on him to return Scindia's visit; and that if he did not do so it would be treated as a slight and insult, and would serve as a pretext for open war against him; and that, as he could but muster three or four thousand men, the city must yield without resistance.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I believe that this is the work of Bajee Rao, and of Ghatgay--two scoundrels, of whom I prefer Ghatgay who, although a ruffian, is at least a fearless one, while Bajee Rao is a monster of deceit. I know that there have, of late, been several interviews between him and Ghatgay; and I have not the least doubt that the whole affair has been arranged between them with the hope, on Bajee's part, of getting rid of Nana; and on Ghatgay's, of removing a sturdy opponent of his future son-in-law, and of acquiring a large quantity of loot by the plunder of Nana's adherents.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You did well to come here for, if the work of plunder is once begun, there is no saying how far it will spread. I shall ride, at once, to see the Peishwa, and request an explanation of what has occurred. There is that trooper's dress still lying ready for you, if you would like to put it on. There is a spare horse in my stable."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Thank you, sir; I should like it very much;" and, rapidly changing his dress, he was ready by the time the horses were brought round.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He then took his place among the troopers of the escort, and rode to Bajee Rao's country palace, which was some three miles from the town.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 After seeing everything in train, the Peishwa had left Scindia's camp before Nana's arrival there; and had summoned a dozen of the latter's adherents, under the pretence that he desired to see them on a matter of business. Wholly unsuspicious of treachery, they rode out at once; and each, on his arrival, was seized and thrown into a place of confinement.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The Resident learned this from a retainer of one of these nobles. He had made his escape when his master was seized, and was riding to carry the news to the British official; whose influence, he thought, might suffice to save the captives' lives.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 On arriving at the palace four of the troopers were ordered to dismount--Harry being one of those selected--and, on demanding to see the Peishwa the Resident was, after some little delay, ushered into the audience chamber, where Bajee Rao was seated, with several of his officers standing behind him. He received Mr. Uhtoff with a show of great courtesy.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The latter, however, stood stiffly, and said:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have come, Your Highness, to request an explanation of what is going on. The city of Poona is being treated like a town taken by siege. The houses of a number of persons of distinction are being attacked by Scindia's soldiery. Fighting is going on in the streets, and the whole of the inhabitants are in a state of wild alarm.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But this is not all. Nana Furnuwees has, owing to his reliance upon a solemn guarantee given for his safe return, been seized when making a ceremonial visit to Scindia."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You must surely be misinformed," the Peishwa said. "You will readily believe that I am in perfect ignorance of such a proceeding."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I might believe it, Prince," Mr. Uhtoff said, coldly, "had I not been aware that you and your officers have decoyed a number of Nana's friends to this palace and, on their arrival, had them suddenly arrested."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Bajee Rao, practised dissimulator as he was, flushed at this unexpected accusation.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I learned, sir," he said, after a pause, "that there was a plot against my person, by Nana Furnuwees and his adherents; and I have therefore taken what I considered the necessary step of placing these in temporary confinement."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is a little strange, Your Highness, that the man who placed you on the musnud should be conspiring to turn you from it. However, what has been done has been done; and I cannot hope that any words of mine will avail to persuade you to undo an act which will be considered, throughout India, as one of the grossest treachery and ingratitude. My duty is a simple one: namely, merely to report to my Government the circumstances of the case."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The officers behind the Peishwa fingered the hilts of their swords, and the four troopers involuntarily made a step forward, to support the Resident. Bajee, however, made a sign to those behind him to remain quiet; and the Resident, turning abruptly, and without salutation to the Peishwa, left the hall, followed by his men.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They mounted as soon as they had left the palace, and rode back to the Residency; Mr. Uhtoff keeping his place at their head, and speaking no word until he dismounted, when he asked Harry to accompany him to his room.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "This is a bad business, indeed, Mr. Lindsay. I cannot say that I am surprised because, having studied Bajee Rao's character, I have for some time been expecting that he would strike a blow at Nana. Still, I acknowledge that it has come suddenly, and the whole position of affairs has changed. Bajee has freed himself from Nana; but he has only riveted Scindia's yoke more firmly on his shoulders. Like most intriguers, he has overreached himself. He has kept one object in view, and been blind to all else.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "His course should have been to support Nana against Scindia, and thus to keep the balance of power in his own hands. He has only succeeded in ridding himself of the one man who had the good of his country at heart, and who was the only obstacle to Scindia's ambition. The fool has ruined both himself and his country.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I think, Mr. Lindsay, that the best plan will be for you to mount at once, and ride down to Bombay. Your presence here, just now, can be of no special utility; and it is most desirable that the Government should have a full statement of the matter laid before them, by one who has been present, and who has made himself fully acquainted with the whole politics of the Deccan.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is better that you should not go into the town again. I will send in for your horses, as soon as the tumult has subsided. We have several spare animals here, and you and your servant can take two of them. I will write to the Governor a report of my interview with Bajee, and say that I have sent you down to give him all the details of what has taken place; which will save the time that it would take me to write a long report, and will be far more convenient, inasmuch as you can answer any point that he is desirous of ascertaining. I do not think that you can do better than go in the disguise that you now have on; for a soldier to be galloping fast is a common sight, but people would be astonished at seeing either a Brahmin or a trader riding at full speed. I will give orders for the horses to be saddled at once and, in the meantime, you had best take a meal. You will have no chance of getting one on the road, and I have no doubt that dinner is ready for serving. I will tell the butler to give some food to your man, at once."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Twenty minutes later, Harry and Abdool were on their way. Skirting round Poona, they heard the rattle of musketry still being maintained; and indeed, the fighting in the streets of the city continued for twenty-four hours. By two in the morning, they halted at the top of the Ghauts; partly to give the horses a rest, and partly because it would have been very dangerous to attempt to make the descent in the dark.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 At daybreak they continued their journey, arriving at Bombay six hours later. They rode straight for the Government House, where Harry dismounted and, throwing the reins of his horse to Abdool, told the attendant to inform the Governor that a messenger, from the Resident at Poona, desired to see him. He was at once shown in.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Why, it is Mr. Lindsay!" the Governor said, "though I should scarce know you, in your paint and disguise. The matter on which you come must be something urgent, or Mr. Uhtoff would not have sent you down with it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry handed over the despatch of which he was bearer and, as the Governor ran his eye over it, his face became more and more grave, as he gathered the news.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "This is serious, indeed," he said, "most serious. Now be pleased to sit down, Mr. Lindsay, and furnish me with all the particulars of the affair."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When Harry had finished, the Governor said:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I imagine that you can have eaten nothing today, Mr. Lindsay. I am about to take tiffin, and bid you do so with me. I shall at once send to members of the Council and, by the time we have finished our meal, they will no doubt be here."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I shall be very glad to do so, sir, if you will allow me to go into the dressing room, and put on my uniform. I should hardly like to sit down to table in my present dress."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do so by all means, if you wish it; but you must remember that your colour will not agree well with your dress."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I will remove these caste marks, sir, and then I shall look only as if I were somewhat severely tanned."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In ten minutes a servant knocked at the door, and said that luncheon was ready. Harry was already dressed in his uniform, and had removed the marks on his forehead; the dye, however, was as dark as ever. He had, on leaving the Governor's room, sent a servant down to fetch his wallet, and to tell Abdool that he was to take the horses to the barracks.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The meal was an informal one. The Governor asked many questions, and was pleased at the knowledge that Harry showed of all the principal persons in Poona, and their character and ability.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "At the present moment," he said, "the information that you have given me cannot be utilized; but it would be most valuable, were we to get mixed up in the confusion of parties at Poona. I gather that you consider Nana Furnuwees to be a great man."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "My opinion is not worth much, on that point, sir. I think that he has, over and over again, shown great courage in extricating himself from difficulties which appeared to be overwhelming. I believe him to be a sincere patriot, and that he only desires to be at the head of the administration of affairs that he may prevent civil war from breaking out, and to thwart the ambition of the great princes. His tastes are simple, his house is furnished plainly, he cares nothing for the pleasures of the table; but he is honest and, I believe, absolutely truthful--qualities which certainly are possessed by very few men in the Deccan.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I grant that he is not disposed to enter into any alliance with the British. He has frequently told me that he admires them greatly for their straightforwardness and truthfulness, as well as for their bravery and their methods of government, both in the great towns and in the districts in which they are masters; but he fears that, were they to send an army to Poona on his behalf, or on that of any of the other parties, it might end by their acquiring control over the affairs of the country, and make them arbitrators in all disputes."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No doubt he is right, there," the Governor said, with a smile. "However, at present we are certainly not likely to interfere in the quarrels and intrigues beyond the Ghauts; nor do I see why we should be brought into collision with the Mahrattas--at any rate, until they have ceased to quarrel among themselves, and unite under one master. In that case, they might make another effort to turn us out.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And now we will go into the room where the Council must be, by this time, assembled."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 This proved to be the case, and the Governor read to them the note that he had received from Mr. Uhtoff; and then requested Harry to repeat the details, as fully as he had already done. There was a consensus of opinion as to the importance of the news.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Come round again tomorrow morning, Mr. Lindsay," the Governor said; "by that time I shall have fully thought the matter out."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "So you have been masquerading as a native again, Mr. Lindsay?" the colonel said, when Harry called upon him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I can hardly consider it masquerading, as I merely resumed the dress I wore for many years; and I certainly speak Mahratti vastly better than I speak English for, although I improved a good deal while I was here, I am conscious that, though my grammar may be correct, my pronunciation differs a good deal from that of my comrades."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You speak English wonderfully well, considering that you learned it from the natives," the colonel said. "At first, you spoke as a native that had learned English; but a casual observer would not, now, detect any accent that would lead him to suppose that you had not been brought up in England.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You will, of course, be at mess this evening?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I think it would be better that I should not do so, sir. In the first place, I should have innumerable questions to answer; and in the second, which is more important, anything that I said might be heard by mess waiters. It is quite possible that some of these are in the pay of Scindia, or Holkar, who keep themselves well informed of all that goes on here; and were it known that an English officer had come down in disguise, it would greatly increase the danger when I return there."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have no doubt that you are right, Mr. Lindsay. Is there anything new at Poona?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, Colonel; and as it will be generally known in two or three days, there can be no harm in my telling you. Scindia has made Nana Furnuwees a prisoner, by an act of the grossest treachery. He has killed almost all his principal adherents and, when I got away, his troops were engaged in looting the town."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That is grave news," the colonel said. "So long as Nana was in power, it was certain that Scindia could not venture to take his army, out of his own country for the purpose of attacking us; but now that Nana is overthrown, and Scindia will be minister to the Peishwa, we may expect troubles."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Not at present. Scindia's army has, for months, been without pay. He has no means of settling with them and, until he does so, they certainly will not move."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I do not think that would detain him long, Mr. Lindsay. He has only to march them into other territories, with permission to plunder, and they would be quite satisfied. He certainly can have no liking for the Rajahs of Berar or Kolapoore, for both of them assisted Nana to regain his power; and an attack upon them would, at once, satisfy vengeance and put his troops in a good temper."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But there is no doubt that the Peishwa will find it much more irksome to be under Scindia's control than that of Nana. And were Scindia to march away, he would at once organize an army, and buy Holkar's aid, to render himself independent of Scindia."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "They are treacherous beggars, these Mahrattas," the colonel said. "They are absolutely faithless, and would sell their fathers if they could make anything by the transaction.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then you do not know yet whether you are to return?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No; I shall see the Governor again, tomorrow morning; and shall then receive orders."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I will have some dinner sent over to your quarters, from the mess. Do not have too much light in the room, or your colour may be noticed by the servant. I will let the officers know that you have returned. No doubt many of them will come in for a chat with you. As no one can overhear you, I do not think that any harm can be done by it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I think not, Colonel."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div>

 "I will tell them," the colonel went on, "that you are on secret service; that you will tell them as much as you can safely do, but they must abstain from pressing you with questions. We all know that you have been acting as assistant to Mr. Uhtoff, because it was mentioned in orders that you had been detailed for that duty; but they know no more than that, and will doubtless be surprised at your colour. But you can very well say that, as you had an important message to carry down, you thought it best to disguise yourself."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That will do excellently, Colonel; and I shall be very glad to have a talk with my friends again."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 After leaving the colonel, Harry went to his own room; where he found Soyera, who had been fetched by Abdool.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am sorry to say that I am going away, almost directly, mother," he said; "but it cannot be helped."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I do not expect you always to stay here, Harry. Now that you are in the Company's service, you must, of course, do what you are ordered. I am glad, indeed, to find that, although you have been with them only a year, you are chosen for a post in which you can gain credit, and attract the attention of the authorities here."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is all thanks to the pains that you took to prepare me for such work.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I don't expect to be away so long, this time. And indeed, now that Nana Furnuwees is a prisoner, it does not seem to me that there can be anything special to do, until some change takes place in the situation, and Scindia either openly assumes supreme power, or marches away with his army."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 That evening, Harry's room was crowded with visitors. The news of the treacherous arrest of Nana Furnuwees excited the liveliest interest; and was received with very much regret, as Nana was considered the only honest man of all the ministers of the native princes, and to be friendly disposed towards the British; and all saw that his fall might be followed by an important change in the attitude of the Mahrattas.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Two days later, Harry returned to Poona. The next eighteen months passed without any very prominent incidents. In order to furnish Scindia with money to pay his troops, and to be in a position to march away, Bajee Rao agreed that Ghatgay should, as Scindia's minister, raise contributions in Poona. Accordingly, a rule of the direst brutality and cruelty took place. The respectable inhabitants--the merchants, traders, and men of good family--were driven from their houses, tortured often to death, scourged, and blown away from the mouths of cannon. No person was safe from his persecution, and the poorest were forced to deliver up all their little savings. The rich were stripped of everything, and atrocities of all kinds were committed upon the hapless population.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Bajee Rao countenanced these things, and was now included in the hatred felt for Ghatgay and Scindia. Troubles occurred between the Peishwa and the Rajah of Satara, who refused to deliver up an agent of Nana whom he had, at Bajee's request, seized. As Scindia's troops refused to move, Purseram Bhow was released from captivity and, raising an army, captured the city of Satara, and compelled the fort to surrender; but when ordered by Bajee Rao to disband the force that he had collected, he excused himself from doing so, on the plea that he had no money to pay them, or to carry out the promises that he had given them.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Scindia himself was not without troubles. In addition to the mutiny of his troops, the three widows of his father who, instead of receiving the treatment proper to their rank, had been neglected and were living in poverty, sought an interview with him; and were seized by Ghatgay, flogged, and barbarously treated. Their cause was taken up by the Brahmins, who had held the principal offices under Scindia's father; and it was at last settled that they should take up their residence at Burrampoor, with a suitable establishment. Their escort, however, had received private orders to carry them to the fortress of Ahmednuggur.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The news of this treachery spread, soon after they had left the camp; and an officer in the interest of the Brahmins started, with a troop of horse which he commanded, dispersed the escort, and rescued the ladies. These he carried to the camp of Amrud Rao, Bajee Rao's foster brother; who instantly afforded them protection and, sallying out, attacked and defeated a party of their pursuers, led by Ghatgay himself.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Five battalions of infantry were then sent by Scindia, but Amrud attacked them boldly, and compelled them to retreat. Negotiations were then opened, and Amrud, believing Scindia's promises, moved his camp to the neighbourhood of Poona. But, during a Mahommedan festival, he and his troops were suddenly attacked by a few brigades of infantry; which dispersed them, slew great numbers, and pillaged their camp.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Holkar now joined Amrud Rao, who had escaped from the massacre. The Peishwa negotiated an alliance with the Nizam. Scindia sent envoys to Tippoo, to ask for his assistance. Bajee Rao did the same, and it looked as if a desperate war was about to break out.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 All this time, Harry had been living quietly in the Residency, performing his duties as assistant to Colonel Palmer, who had again taken charge there. There was no occasion for him to resume his disguises. The atrocities committed by Ghatgay, in Poona, were apparent to all; and at present there seemed no possible combination that could check the power of Scindia.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Colonel Palmer, however, had several interviews with Bajee Rao, and entreated him to put a stop to the doings of Ghatgay; but the latter declared that he was powerless to interfere, and treated with contempt the warnings, of the colonel, that he was uniting the whole population in hatred of him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The rebellion under Amrud, and the adhesion of Holkar to it, seemed to afford some hope that an end would come to the terrible state of things prevailing; and Colonel Palmer became convinced that Scindia was really anxious to return to his own dominions, where his troops, so long deprived of their natural leaders, were in a state of insubordination. If the Nana were but released from his prison at Ahmednuggur, something might be done, he said. He might be able to supply sufficient money to enable Scindia to leave; and the alarm Nana's liberation would give, to Bajee, would compel him to change his conduct, lest Nana should join Amrud and, with the assent of the whole population, place him on the musnud.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Nana is the only man who can restore peace to this unhappy country," he said to Harry, "but I see no chance of Scindia releasing a prisoner whom he could always use to terrify Bajee, should the latter dare to defy his authority."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry thought the matter over that night and, at last, determined to make an attempt to bring about his old friend's release. In the morning he said to the Resident:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have been thinking over what you said last night, Colonel, and with your permission I am resolved to make an attempt to bring about Nana's release."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But how on earth do you mean to proceed, Mr. Lindsay?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "My plans are not quite made up yet, sir. In the first place, I shall ask you to give me three weeks' leave so that, if I fail, you can make it evident that you are not responsible for my undertaking. In the next place, I shall endeavour to see Nana in his prison, and ascertain from him whether he can pay a considerable sum to Scindia for his release. If I find that he is in a position to do so, I shall then--always, of course, in disguise--endeavour to have a private interview with Scindia, and to convince him that it is in every way to his interest to allow Nana to ransom himself. He is, of course, perfectly well aware that, in spite of Bajee's assurances of friendship, he is at heart bitterly opposed to him; and that the return of Nana, with the powers he before possessed, would neutralize the Peishwa's power."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It would be an excellent thing, if that could be done," the colonel said; "but it appears to me to be an absolute impossibility."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I would rather not tell you how I intend to act, sir; so that, in case of failure, you can disavow all knowledge of my proceedings."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, since you are willing to undertake the risk, and unquestionably the Bombay Government would see, with great pleasure, Nana's return to power, I will throw no obstacle in your way. You had better, to begin with, write me a formal request for a month's leave to go down to Bombay. Is there anything else that I can do, to aid your project?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Nothing, whatever; and I am much obliged to you for acceding to my request. If for no other reason than that my success should have the effect of releasing the inhabitants of Poona, from the horrible tyranny to which they are exposed, I shall be willing to risk a great deal to gain it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I shall not leave for a day or two, as I wish to think over all the details of my plan, before I set about carrying it out."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Going into the city, Harry went to the spot where the proclamations of Scindia were always affixed. These were of various kinds; such as forbidding anyone carrying arms to be in the streets after nightfall; and that every inhabitant should furnish an account of his income, in order that taxation should be carefully distributed. To these Scindia's seal was affixed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 One such order had been placed there that morning. A sentry marched up and down in front of it, lest any insult should be offered to the paper. Satisfied that this would suit his purpose, he called Abdool to him, and explained what he wanted.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It will not be till this evening, for I want, before that step is taken, to collect a party of ten horsemen to ride with me to Ahmednuggur and back. By this time you know a great many people in the town and, if I were to pay them well, you should have no difficulty in getting that number."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I could do that in half an hour, sahib. There are a great number of the disbanded soldiers of the Peishwa's army who are without employment, and who would willingly undertake anything that would bring them in a little money."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, you can arrange with them, today. They must not attract attention by going out together, but must meet at the village of Wittulwarree."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The next morning, Harry went to the shop of a trader who was, he knew, formerly employed by Nana, and purchased from him a suit such as would be worn by an officer in Scindia's service. Then he wrote out a document in Mahratti, giving an order to the governor of Ahmednuggur to permit the bearer, Musawood Khan, to have a private interview with Nana Furnuwees. This done, he told the resident that he intended to leave that night.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Colonel Palmer asked no questions, but only said:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Be careful, Mr. Lindsay, be careful; it is a desperate enterprise that you are undertaking, and I should be sorry, indeed, if so promising an officer should be lost to our service."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I will be careful, I assure you. I have no wish to throw away my life."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When evening came on, he went to his room, stained his skin from head to foot, put on the caste marks, then dressed himself in the clothes that he had that morning purchased and, at nine o'clock, left the house quietly with Abdool. At that hour Poona would be quiet, for the terror was so great that few people ventured into the street after nightfall.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When they approached the house on which the proclamation was fixed, they separated. Harry went quietly to the corner of the street, a few yards from the spot where the soldier was marching up and down, and listened intently, peeping out from behind the wall whenever the sentry was walking in the other direction. Presently he heard a smothered sound, and the dull thud of a falling body.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He ran out. Abdool had crawled up to the other end of the sentry's beat, and taken his place in a doorway. The sentry came up to within a couple of yards of him, and then turned. Abdool sprang out and, with a bound, leapt upon the sentry's back and, with one hand, grasped his musket.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Taken wholly by surprise, the sentry fell forward on his face, Abdool still clinging to him. He pressed his knife against the soldier's neck and said that, at the slightest cry, he would drive it home. Half stunned by the fall, the soldier lay without moving.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;Illustration: Harry ran up to the proclamation and tore it down.
</div> 
<div>
 Without the loss of a moment, Harry ran up to the proclamation and tore it down, and then darted off again. Abdool, springing to his feet, brought the butt end of the soldier's musket down on his head; and then, satisfied that a minute or two must elapse before the man would be recovered sufficiently to give the alarm, he too ran off, and joined Harry at the point where they had separated.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That was well managed, Abdool. Now we will walk quietly until we are outside the town as, if we met some of Scindia's men, they would question were we hurrying."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In a few minutes they were outside the city; and then, running at a brisk pace, they reached the Residency. They were challenged by the sentry but, on Harry giving his name, he was of course allowed to pass.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He went quietly into his room and lighted a candle. Putting his knife in the flame he heated it, and then carefully cut the seal from the paper on which it was fixed, placed it on the order that he had written and, again heating his knife, passed it along under the paper, until the under part of the seal was sufficiently warmed to adhere to it. He placed the order in an inner pocket, put a brace of pistols into his sash, and buckled on a native sword that he had bought that morning; then he went out again, and found that Abdool had the horses in readiness, with two native saddles, with embroidered housings such as was used by native officers; which he had, by Harry's orders, purchased that morning in the bazaar.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They at once mounted, and started at a gallop for Wittulwarree.
