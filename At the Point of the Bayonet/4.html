The reports sent in to him, by those in charge of the royal preserves, could scarcely be considered as satisfactory; as they stated that, owing to the fact that for years there had been no hunting there, the tigers had greatly increased in number, and had thinned down the stags and, indeed, in some cases had so destroyed other game that they were driven to escape from the enclosures, and to ravage the villages. But beyond receiving these reports, and riding over occasionally to the preserves, Harry had little to do save to take part in any court ceremonies and, when called upon to do so, to accompany the Peishwa in his walks in the palace garden. He therefore determined to learn to read and write in Mahratta and, for two or three hours a day, a man of the weynsh, or mercantile class, came in to teach him. So careful was Nana Furnuwees, in preventing Scindia's adherents from approaching the prince, that Harry had nothing whatever to report on this head. 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 One day, when Mahdoo Rao, who had taken a great liking to him, was walking in the garden, chatting familiarly to him of his life in the country, and his adventures with tigers and other wild beasts, he said:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Have you seen my cousin, Bajee Rao?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, Your Highness, I have never seen him."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You have heard of him, of course, and nothing but good."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That is so, Prince. It seems that, both in sports and learning, he is wonderfully well instructed."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I should like to see him," the prince said. "I admire what I have heard of him, greatly, and it is hard that he should be shut up in prison; and yet he is scarcely more a prisoner than I am."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry was struck with dismay.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But Your Highness is in no way a prisoner!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am not shut up in a fortress," the young prince said, "but I am no more my own master than Bajee Rao is. Nana Furnuwees treats me as if I were a child. He is, I know, devoted to me; but that makes it no more pleasant. I can go where I like, but it is always with my retinue. I cannot choose my own friends."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Your Highness will forgive me, if I say that it is for your own safety, and for the peace of the country that your minister watches over you so jealously; and doubtless he thinks that, having been the chief adviser to your family, for so many years, having guarded it so successfully from those who would have lessened your authority, for the present it is of the greatest importance that he should continue to guide the state."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am, at least, very glad that he allows me a companion of my own age, to whom I can talk freely."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "On all subjects, Your Highness, excepting state matters. Nana presented me because I was ignorant of the court, and knew nothing whatever of intrigues, and was not likely to take any part in them. Therefore, Your Highness, I pray you but to speak upon ordinary matters; be assured I am your devoted servant, but the courtiers would grow suspicious, were you to talk of state matters with me. These things speedily become known, and I should fall under Nana's displeasure."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Perhaps you are right," the Peishwa admitted, in a tone of melancholy. "No doubt, whatever passes in this house is known to my minister; and indeed, it is his duty to make himself so acquainted. Still, I feel it hard that I should not have one friend to whom I can speak."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The time will come, Prince, when you will be able to do so and, doubtless, there will be at hand those who will dare to have your confidence."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The prince was silent but, after this, he abstained from any remarks to Harry concerning the state. He had, indeed, for some time been in correspondence with Bajee Rao, who had gained the confidence of one of those appointed to look after him and, though there was nothing save expressions of friendship on the part of both princes, Nana was furious when he found out, from his spies, what was going on.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The news came as a shock to the minister. Nana had been the greatest enemy of the house of Rugoba; and the discovery of this correspondence, and the friendship between the two young men, so threatened his authority that, after ordering that Bajee Rao and his brothers should be more strictly confined than before, he visited the Peishwa and upbraided him bitterly for having entered upon a friendship with the head of a party which had harassed his family, and had brought innumerable troubles on the state. Then he sent a message to Harry, bidding him to come, at once.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How is it, Puntojee," he said sternly, "that you have altogether failed to justify the faith I put in you, and have already assisted Mahdoo Rao to enter into relations with my enemy, Bajee Rao?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry was thunderstruck at this sudden attack.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "My lord, you must have been misinformed. I know nothing of any such correspondence and, if it really went on, I think the Peishwa would have taken me into his confidence."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you mean to say that Mahdoo has not spoken to you about his cousin?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, sir, I do not say so for, some four months ago, he spoke in terms of admiration for Bajee Rao; but he did not pursue the subject, and never afterwards alluded to it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The minister looked at him fixedly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I believe you," he said. "You do not look like a double-faced man, but as one who would tell the truth, whatever were the consequences. Moreover, I felt that if you had known of Mahdoo Rao's intentions, and had not reported them to me, you would, on receiving my message, have endeavoured to make your escape. I have of course enquired, and found that you spent your afternoon, as usual, with your scribe; and that you afterwards rode out to Sufder's camp, and there talked for half an hour, sitting outside the tent and conversing on ordinary matters; and then you returned here to the palace. These proceedings go far to assure me that you were ignorant of the discovery that had been made, that a correspondence had been going on between Mahdoo and Bajee. Still, I thought you might have known of the correspondence, though not of the discovery; but now I am quite convinced that you were altogether ignorant of what was going on."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The scene with Nana, and the knowledge that he had brought upon his cousins even stricter confinement than before, acted most painfully upon the mind of the young Peishwa, already embittered by the restraint in which he was being held. He now shut himself up in his room, and absolutely refused to leave it. His absence from the durbars was put down to illness. Nana paid no great attention to him, believing that the young prince would speedily recover himself.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 This, however, was not the case, for settled melancholy took possession of him. On the 22nd of October he appeared at the Duddera, a high ceremonial, went among his troops and, in the evening, received his chiefs and the representatives from the great rajahs but, three days later, he threw himself from a terrace in front of his palace, broke two of his limbs, and so seriously injured himself that he died, two days afterwards; having, almost in his last breath, expressed to Nana his strong desire that Bajee Rao should succeed him on the musnud.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The consternation of the minister was unbounded. It seemed that, by this sudden and unexpected blow, the whole of his plans were overthrown; and that not only his position, but his very life, was in danger.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He sent for Harry, two hours after the Peishwa's death.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Answer me frankly," he said. "Can I depend upon you, absolutely? And have you had no communication of any kind from my enemies?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You can depend upon me, my lord. Everyone knows that you have saved the state, a score of times; and will, I doubt not, do the same again."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have the will," the minister said, gravely, "but whether I have the power is another thing. I sent off a messenger to the general, Purseram Bhow, bidding him gather as many troops as possible and march hither; and I shall send letters to the Rajah of Nagpore, and Scindia. Holkar, being in Poona, I have already seen and, as he has always supported me against Rugoba, he is as anxious as I am as to the succession.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I shall now send you with a duplicate letter to Purseram Bhow for, since the terrible accident to Mahdoo Rao, whom I loved dearly for his amiable character, it is probable that the adherents of Bajee Rao have been active; and that my every movement is watched, and attempts may be made to stop any messengers that I may send out. Take Sufder's troop with you. If you are stopped, fight your way through, whatever their force. It is a matter of supreme importance that this letter should reach the general."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It shall reach him, my lord," Harry said, as he took it; "in five minutes I shall be on my way."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Going to his room he changed his attire, mounted his horse, and rode to Sufder's camp. The men were all ready, as Nana had sent an order to Sufder to prepare instantly for a journey.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "So it is you, Puntojee!" the captain said, as he rode up; "the orderly did not tell me whom I was to escort, nor our destination. In which direction do we ride?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am bearer of a letter to Purseram Bhow."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then I know the direction;" and, giving orders to his men, he rode off at once by the side of Harry.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "This is a terrible business, Puntojee."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am greatly grieved, indeed, for no one could have been kinder to me than Mahdoo Rao."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, yes," Sufder said; "that is all very well, but the serious side of the matter is that, just as everything seemed settled, we may be entering upon another civil war, more terrible than the last. Of course, I am sorry for the young Peishwa; but I doubt whether he was in any way fit to rule over the Mahrattas. Kindness of heart goes for nothing with a people like ours; split up into many factions, led by many chiefs, and ever ready for war. It needs a strong, as well as an able man to hold in check all the parties in the state.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Scindia was the sort of man to rule us. He was strong in every way, was troubled with no scruples, would strike down without mercy any who opposed him. He took great care of his troops, and they were always ready to follow him. That is the man we want on the musnud; not a young prince, of whom we can only say that he was kindly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And why did Nana choose you?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am a second string to his bow. He sent off a messenger as soon as he heard of Mahdoo Rao's accident but, fearing he might be intercepted on the way, he has chosen me as being a person no one would be likely to suspect of being his messenger, on so important a matter."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is important, indeed, Puntojee. There is no saying what may be the result of the Peishwa's death. There is no doubt that Scindia and Holkar will, for once, be in complete accord with Nana Furnuwees, and will combine in any plan to keep Rugoba's son from succeeding; still, there are many of the friends of Rugoba who will be ready to declare for his son and, moreover, there are the stories that have been so widely circulated as to Bajee's personal appearance, and his many accomplishments--these will gain for him a great number of partisans."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The journey was performed without interruption. At one time, a body of some fifty horsemen made their appearance on rising ground near the road, but drew off when they saw how strong was the party and, after a ride of sixty miles, they arrived at Purseram Bhow's camp. Harry dismounted in front of the general's tent and, entering, handed him the letter.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What is your news?" the latter asked, before opening it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "There is none, General, beyond what the letter, sent to you three hours before I left, will have prepared you to hear. I only bear a copy of that letter, in case the first should not have reached you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is well that the precaution was taken for, in truth, the messenger has not arrived."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is possible that he may have been murdered on the way, sir; for we saw a party of fifty horsemen on the road, whose intentions seemed to be hostile, but as I had Sufder's troop of a hundred men with me, they drew off."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But what is the news, then, that is so important that steps are taken to stop messengers that bear it?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry related what had taken place, the old officer giving many ejaculations of regret, and horror, at the news of Mahdoo Rao's death.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "'Tis a terrible misfortune, indeed," he said, "and is like to throw the whole country into disorder again."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He opened the despatch now, and glanced through it. He called some of his officers, who were gathered near the tent, and ordered them to cause the trumpets to be sounded for all the troops to be in readiness to march, at once; leaving only a small body of infantry to pack up the tents, and follow at a more leisurely pace with the baggage.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 An hour later two regiments of cavalry started, infantry men being taken up behind the troopers and, late the next day, they arrived at Poona. Scindia and the Rajah of Berar had also been sent for, in haste and, as soon as they arrived, a council was held as to the choice that should be made of a successor.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 All were opposed to the selection of Bajee Rao; for he would have been brought up by his mother, with the deepest enmity towards those who had successfully combined against his father. It was therefore proposed that the widow of Mahdoo Rao should adopt a son, in whose name the government should be carried on.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 It was not until two months had been spent in negotiations that the matter was finally settled. One of Scindia's ministers, named Balloba, alone opposed the course decided upon; and Bajee Rao opened communications with him, and succeeded in winning him over to his cause. Having done this he addressed Scindia; offering him a very large addition to his territory, and payment of all his expenses, if he would assist him to gain his rightful position. As Balloba had great influence over the young Scindia, the offer was accepted.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The arrangement was made so secretly that Nana Furnuwees had received no intimation, whatever, of what was going on, until the agreement had been concluded. Purseram Bhow was again summoned to Poona and, with his usual energy, made a march of one hundred and twenty miles in forty-eight hours.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The position was a difficult one, indeed. At one blow, the plans that had been so carefully laid by Nana were shattered. Scindia, who had but a month or two before formed one of the confederacy, had now gone round to the side of Bajee Rao, who regarded the minister as his greatest enemy. Holkar was not to be depended upon and, in Poona, there were many adherents of the son of Rugoba. The council held by Nana, Purseram, and two or three other great officers was long and, at times, stormy; but it was finally agreed that the sole way out of the perilous position, caused by Scindia's desertion, was to anticipate him and to release Bajee Rao, and declare him Peishwa.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Purseram started, at once, to the fort where the brothers were confined. Harry, who was now deeply interested in the course of events, was one of Nana's officers who accompanied Purseram. On hearing the general's errand, the officer in command of the fort at once sent for Bajee, his brother Chimnajee, and Amrud--who was the adopted son of Rugoba, and who stood on an equal footing with regard to the succession. Bajee Rao listened calmly to the proposals made to him in Nana's name, asked several questions, and demanded guarantees; but was evidently disposed to accept the proposals, if assured that they were made in good faith.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Amrud strongly urged him to decline the offer; but Bajee, upon Purseram taking the most solemn oath known to the Hindoos, in proof of his sincerity, accepted the offer and, with his brother Chimnajee, rode with Purseram to Poona; Amrud being left behind in the fort, as Purseram considered that he would continue to exercise his influence over Bajee in a direction hostile to Nana's interest.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As soon as the party arrived at the capital, an interview took place between Bajee and Nana when, in the presence of many of the great officers, both swore to forget all enmities and injuries, and Bajee promised to retain Nana at the head of his administration.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 That same evening, the minister sent for Harry.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Puntojee," he said, "I have a commission for you. I know that you are loyal to me, and that I can depend upon you. I wish you to go at once to Scindia's camp, which is now on the bank of the Godavery, and ascertain how he takes the news. Doubtless Balloba, his prime minister, will be furious at finding that, instead of Bajee becoming a mere creature of Scindia's, I have placed him on the musnud, and retain my place as his chief minister. I can employ you for this business better than most others, for the greater part of my officers are personally known to those of Scindia, while you have scarce been seen by them. I have also a high idea of your shrewdness; and I have no doubt that you will, in some way, be able to gain the information that I require--indeed, it will probably be the public talk of the camp. If you should find an opportunity of entering into negotiations, with any influential person in Scindia's court, I authorize you to do so in my name; and to agree to any reasonable demands that he may make, either for a payment in money or in estates. Scindia's character is wholly unformed and, though today he may be guided by Balloba, tomorrow he may lean on someone else.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You can go in any guise you think fit, either as a trooper or as a camp follower. In either case, you had better take Sufder and twenty men with you; and leave them in concealment within a few miles of the camp so that, in case of necessity, you can join them; and his men can act as messengers, and bring your reports to me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As it was now a year since Harry had first gone to Poona, and he had during that time worked diligently, he could now both read and write the Mahratta language, and was thus able to send in written reports; instead of being obliged to rely upon oral messages, which might be misdelivered by those who carried them, or possibly reported to others instead of to the minister; whereas reading and writing were known to but few of the Mahrattas, outside the Brahmin class.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Sufder expressed himself much pleased, when he heard that he was to accompany Harry.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am sick of this life of inactivity," he said. "Why, we have had no fighting for the past five years; and we shall forget how to use our arms, unless there is something doing. I would willingly accompany you into Scindia's camp, but I am far too well known there to hope to escape observation. However, I will pick out twenty of my best men so that, if there should be a skirmish, we shall be able to hold our own. Of course, I shall choose men who have good horses, for we may have to ride for it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry himself was very well mounted, for Mahdoo Rao had given him two excellent horses; and as he had, when out with Sufder's troop, tried them against the best of those of the sowars, he felt sure that he could trust to them, in case of having to ride for his life. The trooper who looked after them had become much attached to him, and he determined to take him with him into Scindia's camp, one of Sufder's other men looking after the horses.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 After a consultation with Sufder, he decided on adopting the costume of a petty trader or pedlar carrying garments, scarfs, and other articles used by soldiers. Of these he laid in a store and, three hours after his interview with Nana, started with his escort; the trooper leading his spare horse, on which his packs were fastened, and his own man riding a country pony. The distance to Scindia's camp was under a hundred miles, and they took three days in accomplishing it. It was important that the horses should not be knocked up, as their lives might depend upon their speed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When within ten miles of their destination, they halted in a grove near the Moola river. Here Harry changed his clothes, and assumed those of a small merchant. Then he mounted the pony; a portion of the packs was fastened behind him, and the rest carried by his servant.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Scindia's camp lay around Toka, a town on the Godavery at the foot of a range of hills. On arriving there he went to the field bazaar, where a large number of booths, occupied by traders and country peasants, were erected. The former principally sold arms, saddlery, and garments; the latter, the produce of their own villages. Choosing an unoccupied piece of ground, Harry erected a little shelter tent; composed of a dark blanket thrown over a ridge pole, supported by two others, giving a height of some four feet, in the centre. The pony was picketed just behind this. In front of it a portion of the wares was spread out, and Harry began the usual loud exhortations, to passers by, to inspect them.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Having thus established himself, he left Wasil in charge, explaining to him the prices that he was to ask for each of the articles sold, and then started on a tour through the camp. Here and there pausing to listen to the soldiers, he picked up scraps of news; and learned that there was a general expectation that the army would march, in a day or two, towards Poona--it being rumoured that Scindia and his minister, Balloba, had been outwitted by Nana Furnuwees; and that Balloba had made no secret of his anger, but vowed vengeance against the man who had overthrown plans which, it had been surely believed, would have resulted in Scindia's obtaining supreme control over the Deccan.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Returning to his little tent, he wrote a letter to Nana, telling him what he had gathered, and giving approximately the strength of Scindia's force; adding that, from what he heard, the whole were animated with the desire to avenge what they considered an insult to their prince. This note he gave to Wasil, who at once started on foot to join Sufder; who would forward it, by four troopers, to Poona.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div>

 The next morning he returned and, after purchasing provisions from the countrymen, and lighting a fire for cooking them, he assisted Harry at his stall. The latter was standing up, exhibiting a garment to a soldier, who was haggling with him over the price, when a party of officers rode by. At their head was one whose dress showed him to be a person of importance; and whom Harry at once recognized as Balloba, having often noticed him during the negotiations at Poona. As his eye fell upon Harry he checked his horse for a moment, and beckoned to him to come to him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Come here, weynsh," he said, using the term generally applied to the commercial caste.

 "How comes it," the minister asked, "that so fine a young fellow as you are is content to be peddling goods through the country, when so well fitted by nature for better things? You should be a soldier, and a good one. For so young a man, I have never seen a greater promise of strength.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It seems to me that your face is not unknown to me. Where do you come from?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "From Jooneer, your excellency, where my people are cultivators but, having no liking for that life, I learned the trade of a shopkeeper, and obtained permission to travel to your camp, and to try my fortune in disposing of some of my master's goods."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As Jooneer was but some sixty miles from Toka, the explanation was natural enough and, as the former town lay near to the main road from Scindia's dominions in Candeish, it afforded an explanation of Balloba's partial recognition of his face.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And as a merchant, you can read and write, I suppose?" the latter went on.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, your highness, sufficiently well for my business."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, think it over. You can scarcely find your present life more suitable to your taste than that of a cultivator, and the army is the proper place for a young fellow with spirit, and with strength and muscles such as you have. If you like to enlist in my own bodyguard, and your conduct be good, I will see that you have such promotion as you deserve."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Your excellency is kind, indeed," Harry said, humbly. "Before I accept your kind offer, will you permit me to return to Jooneer to account for my sales to my employer, and to obtain permission of my father to accept your offer; which would indeed be greatly more to my taste than the selling of goods."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is well," Balloba said, and then broke off:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Ah! I know now why I remember your face. 'Tis the lightness of your eyes, which are of a colour rarely seen; but somehow or other, it appears to me that it was not at Jooneer, but at Poona, that I noticed your face."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I was at Poona, with my master, when your highness was there," Harry said.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That accounts for it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The minister touched his horse's flanks with his heel and rode on, with a thoughtful look on his face. Harry at once joined Wasil.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Quick, Wasil! There is no time to be lost. Throw the saddle on to the pony, and make your way out of the camp, at once. Pitch all the other things into the tent, and close it. If you leave them here, it will seem strange. Balloba has seen me at Poona, and it is likely enough that, as he thinks it over, he will remember that it was in a dress altogether different from this. Go at once to Sufder. If you get there before me, tell him to mount at once, and ride fast to meet me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Two minutes later, everything was prepared; and Wasil, mounting the pony, rode off, while Harry moved away among the tents. In a quiet spot, behind one of these, he threw off his upper garments and stood in the ordinary undress of a Hindoo peasant, having nothing on but a scanty loincloth. He had scarcely accomplished this when he heard the trampling of horses; and saw, past the tent, four troopers ride up to the spot he had just left.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Where is the trader who keeps this tent?" one of them shouted. "He is a spy, and we have orders to arrest him."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry waited to hear no more, but walked in the opposite direction; taking care to maintain a leisurely stride, and to avoid all appearance of haste. Then, going down to the road by the side of which the bazaar was encamped, he mingled with the crowd there. Presently, one of the troopers dashed up.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Has anyone seen a man in the dress of a trader?" and he roughly described the attire of which Harry had rid himself.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 There was a general chorus of denial, from those standing round, and the trooper again galloped on.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry continued his walk at a leisurely pace, stopping occasionally to look at articles exposed for sale, until he reached the end of the bazaar. Then he made across the country. Trumpets were blowing now in the camp, and he had no doubt that Balloba had ordered a thorough search to be made for him. He did not quicken his pace, however, until well out of sight; but then he broke into a swinging trot, for he guessed that, when he was not found in the camp, parties of cavalry would start to scour the country. He had gone some four miles when, looking behind him, he saw about twenty horsemen, far back along the road.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The country here was flat and open, with fields irrigated by canals running from the Moola, and affording no opportunity for concealment. Hitherto he had been running well within his powers; but he now quickened his pace, and ran at full speed. He calculated that Wasil would have at least half an hour's start of him; and that, as he would urge the pony to the top of his speed, he would by this time have joined Sufder; and he was sure that the latter would not lose an instant before starting to meet him. He had hesitated, for a moment, whether he should break into a quiet walk and allow the troopers to overtake him, relying upon the alteration of his costume; but he reflected that Balloba might have foreseen that he would change his disguise, and have ordered the arrest of a young man with curiously light eyes.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry had always attempted to conceal this feature, as far as possible, by staining his eyelashes a deep black; but when he looked up, the colour of his eyes could hardly fail to strike anyone specially noticing them.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His constant exercise as a boy had given him great swiftness of foot, and the year passed as a shikaree had added to his endurance and speed and, divested of clothing as he was, he felt sure that the horsemen, who were more than a mile in his rear when he first caught sight of them, would not overtake him for some time. He was running, as he knew, for life; for he was certain that, if caught, Balloba would have him at once put to death as a spy. Although hardy and of great endurance, the Mahratta horses, which were small in size, were not accustomed to being put to the top of their speed except for a short charge; and the five miles that they had galloped already must have, to some extent, fatigued them.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 After running at the top of his speed for about a mile, he looked back. The party was still a long distance in his rear. Again he pressed forward, but his exertions were telling upon him and, before he had gone another half mile, the Mahrattas had approached within little more than half that distance.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Far ahead he thought he could perceive a body of horsemen, but these were nearly two miles away, and he would be overtaken before they could reach him; therefore he turned suddenly off, and took to one of the little banks dividing one irrigated field from another. As soon as the horsemen reached the spot where he had left the road, they too turned off; but Harry, who was now husbanding his strength, saw a sudden confusion among them.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The little bank of earth on which he was running was but a foot wide, and was softened by the water which soaked in from both sides. It could bear his weight, well enough; but not that of a mounted man. Only one or two had attempted to follow it, the others had plunged into the field. Here their horses at once sank up to the knees. Some endeavoured to force the animals on, others to regain the road they had quitted. The two horsemen on the bank were making better progress, but their horses' hoofs sank deeply in the soft earth; and their pace, in spite of the exertions of the riders, was but a slow one.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry turned when he came to the end of the field, and followed another bank at right angles, and was therefore now running in the right direction. He was more than keeping his lead from the foremost of his pursuers Some of the others galloped along the road, parallel to him, but ahead.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The horsemen he had first seen were now within a mile. On they came, at the top of their speed; and the troopers on the road halted, not knowing whether this body were friends or foes, while those on the bank reined in their horses, and rode back to join their comrades. Harry continued to run till he came to another bank leading to the road and, following this, he arrived there just as Sufder galloped up with his party, one of the troopers leading his horse. They gave a shout of welcome, as he came up.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I thought it must be you," Sufder said, "from the way you ran, rather than from your attire. Shall we charge those fellows?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I think not," Harry said. "In the first place Scindia has not, as yet, declared war against Nana and Bajee; in the second, there may be more men coming on behind; therefore it will be best to leave them alone though, if they attack us, we shall, of course, defend ourselves."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I think that is their intention, Puntojee. See, they have gathered together! I suppose they daren't go back, and say that you have escaped."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Give me either your sword or spear."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The latter was part of the regular equipment of the Mahratta horsemen. Sufder handed him his sword and, as the pursuers advanced towards them at a canter which speedily became a gallop, he took his place by the side of Sufder and, the latter giving the word, the band dashed forward to meet their opponents.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The combat was a short one. Sufder's followers were all picked men, and were better mounted than Scindia's troopers. These made special efforts to get at Harry, but the latter's skill with the sword enabled him to free himself from his most pressing opponents. Sufder laid about him stoutly and, his men seconding him well, half their opponents were speedily struck to the ground; and the rest, turning their horses, fled at full speed. Sufder's men would have followed, but he shouted to them to draw rein.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Enough has been done, and well done," he said. "If Scindia means war, nothing will be said about this fight; but if he does not, complaints will doubtless be laid against us, and it is better that we should be able to say that we fought only in self defence; and that, when the attack ceased, we allowed them to ride off unmolested, though we might easily enough have slain the whole of them."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 On arriving at the grove where the troop had halted, Harry at once resumed his own clothes; for although in his early days he had been accustomed to be slightly clad, he felt ill at ease riding almost naked. Here, too, he found Wasil, who had ridden with such speed that his pony was too much exhausted for him to ride back with the rest. He received his master with the greatest joy, for he had feared he would be captured before leaving the camp.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They continued their journey to Jooneer, where they halted for the night. Sufder went to his house, and Harry rode out to the farm.
