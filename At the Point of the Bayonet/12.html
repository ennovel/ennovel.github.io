<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The council are quite of my opinion," he said to Harry, "as to the extreme difficulty and cost that an effort to put down piracy among the islands would involve. Our ships on the station would not be at all sufficient for such work and, at any rate, it is a step that we should not venture to engage in, without the assent of the home government. We shall, of course, write home fully upon the matter, and shall leave the final decision to them; at the same time expressing our own views, and giving some idea as to the force that would have to be employed, the expenditure involved, and the time required for the operation.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "This letter contains a reply, as far as we can give it, to the Governor General's proposals."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "His lordship will, I am sure, be sorry to hear your views, sir; but I imagine that he will not hesitate to undertake the work of punishing, at least, the people of some of the islands where outrages have taken place, as soon as affairs are sufficiently settled in India for him to dispense, for a time, with the services of some of the Company's ships of war."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As Harry expected, the face of the Dutch Governor showed that this statement, when translated, was evidently most unpalatable to him. After a moment's hesitation, however, he said:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "If Lord Mornington waits until everything is quiet in India, it will probably be a very long time before he will be able to carry out the operation you speak of."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That may be, sir. I do not know whether you have heard that Seringapatam has been captured, and that Tippoo, himself, fell in its defence?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A look of amazement, and even of consternation, on the part of the Dutch officials showed that the news was as unwelcome as it was unexpected. The loss of their hold in India, by the wonderful spread of the British power, was an extremely sore point with them. Nothing would have pleased them better than to have heard that the power of the latter had been shattered.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is certainly news to us," the Governor said, shortly. "But there are still other powers in India, that are likely to give at least as much trouble as Mysore has done."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I quite admit that," Harry said, "but have no doubt that we shall be able to deal with them, as satisfactorily as we have done with Tippoo; and possibly as quickly."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That remains to be seen," the Governor said.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Quite so, sir. I have a considerable knowledge of India, and of its native armies; and I doubt whether any of them are as good fighters as Tippoo's men were."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Was Mysore taken by storm, or by famine?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "By storm, after our batteries had opened fire, for a few days."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;Illustration: 'Well, sir, I will now return to shore,' the Governor said.
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, sir, I will now return to shore," the Governor said, abruptly. "You will please to give the assurances of my high esteem to Lord Mornington."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry bowed and, without another word, the Dutch officials descended the accommodation ladder, and returned to shore. When they were out of hearing, Fairclough burst into a hearty laugh.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That was a severe broadside you poured into him, Lindsay. I could see that they were absolutely flabbergasted, when you told them about Mysore. Their manner, before that, had been almost insolent. But you cut their comb finely."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I knew that it would be a heavy blow for them. Of course, they view with intense disgust the spread of our power in India. Not only has it destroyed their dream of empire there but, in case of war with them, their islands here will be absolutely at our mercy. If we are strong enough to win kingdom after kingdom in India, there should be no difficulty in turning out the small bodies of troops they have, in their various possessions."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, I see that; and the time may come very shortly, for the French are likely to lay hands on Holland, before long and, as soon as they do so, we shall be ready to pop down upon them, here. The days of Van Tromp are long passed, and the Dutch navy has become absolutely insignificant.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, I am glad that this is over. The sooner we are off, the better."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Half an hour after the Dutch Governor had left, orders were given to get up the anchor and loosen the sails, and the brig was shortly on her way north.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Now, what is your next move?" Fairclough asked, as the bustle of getting under way subsided.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The Malay tells me that there is a small town on the east coast, and that this would be the most handy for landing, as from there to Johore's town is not more than some twenty miles. Whether the road is open, he cannot say. The news he learned, from the tumangong's people, was that there was a great deal of fighting going on between Johore and some of the petty rajahs. What the position is, at the present, moment he could not discover.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I should propose that we drop anchor off the place; and that, if we find the natives well disposed, the interpreter should make an arrangement, with a couple of natives, to carry up a letter from me to the rajah, saying that I have come on a matter of business from the Governor of India; and asking if he is willing to receive me, and to guarantee my safety. If he says no, there is an end to it. If he says yes, I shall start as soon as the answer comes."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Would you take some blue jackets with you?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No. If we were attacked by a force of Malays, we should probably be annihilated even if I took half your ship's company. Therefore, the smaller the escort I travel with, the better. I shall, of course, take the Malay, my man Abdool, and the four men of the escort. That is quite enough, if we get up without trouble; whereas if there is trouble, the fewer the better."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, I hope no harm will come of it, Lindsay. Of course, if you consider it your duty to go, go you must."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, I think it my duty. I consider the cession of this island to be of extreme importance. If we only obtain it from the tumangong, some day the Rajah of Johore might get the upper hand, and repudiate the treaty made without his approval and, narrow as the strait is, he might cross with forty or fifty canoes, make his way through the woods, and annihilate the settlement at one blow."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No doubt that is so," the other agreed. "Well, if you get detained you will, of course, try and make your way down to the coast. I will remain at anchor off the town for a month, after you start. If there is no news of you, then, I shall conclude that it is hopeless to wait longer, and shall sail for Calcutta with your despatches. As I was present at both your interviews, I shall be able to report, from my own knowledge, as to the disposition shown both by the tumangong and the Dutch."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Ten days later, they cast anchor off the village. Some canoes soon came off to them with fruit and other products and, shortly afterwards, a war canoe came out with the chief man of the town. At first he was very reticent; but a bottle of champagne opened his lips, and he and the interpreter conversed for some time together.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What does he say?" Harry asked, when there was a pause in the conversation.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He says, sir, that the country is very unsettled, and that it is unsafe to travel. The town acknowledges the rajah as its master, and the territory through which the road runs is nominally his; but it is infested by bands owing allegiance to a neighbouring rajah, who is at war with him."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Have you asked him if it is possible to send a messenger through?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He said that there are plenty of men who would venture to go through, if well paid. He thinks that two men would be better than ten, for they could hide themselves more easily in the forest."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, ask him what he would send two messengers through for."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The Malay answered that he could not say, until he had spoken to some of them; but he thought that for ten dollars they would be willing to undertake it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Tell him that I would pay that, and will give them as much more if, on their return, they will guide me and my party to the residence of the rajah."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The Malay shook his head.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "They would want more for that," he said. "Two natives could pass without much danger for, if they were caught, they could say that they belonged to one of the other bands, but had lost their party. It would be quite different if they were to have Europeans with them.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How many would go?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Seven of us, altogether."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I will see about it," the chief said; "but if I succeed, you will give me three bottles of that drink."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have very little of it," Harry said, "but I will agree to give him the three bottles, if he finds messengers to take up my letters; and arranges with them, or others, to guide us up."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The Malay nodded, when the answer was translated to him; drank half a tumbler of ship's rum, with great satisfaction; and then went off.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "This is going to be a more dangerous business than our expedition to Nagpore," Harry said to Abdool, when he told him what the Malay had said about the dangers, and the state of affairs on shore.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "My lord will manage it, somehow," Abdool said; "he was born under a fortunate star, and will assuredly do what is best."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I shall do what I hope is best, Abdool; but one cannot answer how it will turn out. One thing is certain: that if we fall into the hands of the Malays, we shall meet with little mercy."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We should have had no mercy, if we had fallen into the hands of the people of Nagpore, master," Abdool said.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That is true enough, Abdool; and I don't think we should have been much better off, if Scindia had laid hands on us after we had bearded him in his tent. I cannot say that this expedition is one that I should have chosen, were I not convinced that it is my duty. However, we must hope that all will go well with us, as it has done before."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The next day the Malay came off again.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have arranged with two men," he said, "to take your message, for ten dollars; but if they go back with you, they will require twenty, because the rajah might detain them."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That I will pay," Harry said.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But supposing you should not come back," the Malay said, "they might lose their reward. Will you pay them in advance?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No. I will leave the money in Captain Fairclough's hands, and whether I return or not he will, before he leaves, pay it to the men themselves, if they come back, or to their families."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That is a fair proposal," the Malay said. "When do you wish the messengers to start?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The letter will be ready for them, in an hour's time. I will come on shore with it, see the men, and give it to them, with instructions. Will they travel by night, or day?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "They will start at daybreak," the chief said. "The road is but a track, and could not be followed at night; for a forest extends almost the whole distance, and they would find it too dark to keep to the road. I told them that it would be safer to travel at night, but they said it could not be done. They would not be likely to be surprised in the day, as they would travel noiselessly, and would be sure to hear any movement of a party of men coming along the road, and could hide in the forest until they had passed. Moreover, our people do not like travelling in the dark. Evil creatures are about, and even the bravest fear them."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Very well, chief; then I will come ashore in an hour, and give them this letter."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As soon as they had left, Harry went down to the interpreter, and gave him the exact purport of the message to the rajah; leaving it to him to put it in the usual form in which communications were addressed to persons in authority, but saying that it was necessary that he should impress him with his importance, as the commissioner of the great Governor of India. When this was transcribed, on some parchment which had been brought for the purpose, Harry went ashore with Lieutenant Hardy and a strong party of seamen for, although the local chief had apparently been most friendly, the treacherous nature of the Malays was well known, and Fairclough thought it as well to order them to take their cutlasses with them, and each man to carry a brace of pistols hidden beneath his jacket.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A number of natives assembled on the shore as the boat approached, but they seemed to be attracted by curiosity, only. Just as the boat touched the beach, the chief came down to meet them, attended by a dozen armed followers. He invited Harry to follow him to his own house, where the two messengers were awaiting him. They were both men in the prime of life--strong, active-looking fellows. Harry, through his interpreter, explained exactly what he wished done.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "If you carry out your mission well, and quickly," he said, "I shall make you a present, in addition to what has been agreed upon. You will notice the rajah's manner, when he reads the letter; and tell me, when you return, whether he appeared to be pleased or not, whether he hesitates as to giving me a guarantee, and whether, in your opinion, he means to observe it. I shall rely much upon your report."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Three days passed, and then a boat brought the messengers off to the ship.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "So you have made your journey safely?" Harry said, through the interpreter.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We met with no trouble by the way. This is the answer that the rajah has sent."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The letter was a satisfactory one. The rajah expressed willingness to receive the officer whom the English lord had sent to him, and to guarantee his safety while at his town; but said that, owing to the troubled state of the country, he could not guarantee his safety on the road, but would send down an escort of twenty men to guard him on his way up, and the same on his return to the coast.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And now," Harry said, when the interpreter had read the document, "tell me what passed."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "When we said that we were messengers from an English lord, on board a ship with great guns, we were taken to the rajah's house. He took the letter from us, and read it. Then he asked some of those with him what they thought of the matter. They answered that they could see no harm in it, and perhaps you might bring presents. He then asked us how many would come up with you; and we told him four soldiers, as escort, and an interpreter. He nodded, and then talked in a low voice to those around him, and told us to come again, that afternoon, when a letter would be given us to take to you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you think that he means treachery?" Harry asked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That we cannot say, my lord. We have talked as we came down. It seems to us that he could have nothing to gain by hindering you; but that perhaps he might detain you, in order to obtain a ransom for you from the lord of India."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry had already enquired, from the chief of the town, as to the character of the rajah.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He is feared, but not liked," the chief said. "He knows that there are those who would prefer that the old family should reign again, and he has put many to death whom he has suspected as being favourable to this. This is the reason why the tumangong, and other chiefs, have revolted against him. The loss of so much territory has not improved him and, in his fits of passion, he spares none."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What has become of the family of the former rajah?" Harry asked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "His wife and child are prisoners in the palace," he said. "Their friends are surprised that their lives should have been spared; but the rajah is crafty, and it is thought that he holds them so that he could, if his position became desperate, place the young prince on the throne and declare for him; in which case some, who are now his enemies, might come over to his side. I am told that, except that they are kept prisoners, the late rajah's wife and boy are well treated."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The account was not satisfactory, but it did not shake Harry's determination. Questioning the Malays further, he found that they had heard, at Johore, rumours that one of the chiefs on the border of Pahang was collecting a large force, with the intention of attacking the rajah; that the people of Johore were erecting strong palisades round the town; and that the fighting men of the villages round had all been called in for its defence.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "When is this escort to come down?" he asked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "They started at the same time as we did, my lord, and will be here by this evening."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Very well. In that case I will land, tomorrow morning at daybreak, and start at once; so that we shall reach Johore tomorrow. Will you hire four men, to act as carriers for us?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 At the time appointed, Harry went on shore with the Malay, Abdool, and four troopers. They had put on full uniform, and Harry had brought with him, to shore, an assortment of presents similar to those he had given to the tumangong. The two messengers and the four natives, as carriers, were awaiting him and, as he went up the beach, he was joined by twenty Malays with an officer of the rajah, who saluted him profoundly. The chief of the village was also there, and accompanied the party until beyond its boundary.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 After passing a few plantations, they entered a dense forest. The road was a mere footway, apparently but little used. The ground ascended rapidly and, when they had gone a short distance, some of the Malay soldiers went scouting ahead; the rest following in absolute silence, stopping frequently to listen.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is quite evident, Abdool," Harry said, in a whisper, "that what they said at the village is true, and these people from Johore consider the journey to be a very dangerous one. They are evidently expecting a surprise; and I am afraid that, if we are attacked, we shall not be able to place much reliance on them."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Abdool shook his head.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What are we to do, sahib, if we are attacked?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It depends on what these Malays do. If they make a good fight for it, we will fight, too; if not, and we see that resistance is useless, we will remain quiet. It would be of no use for six men to fight fifty, on such ground as this. They would creep up and hurl their spears at us and, though we might kill some of them, they would very soon overpower us.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "drop back, and tell the four troopers that on no account are they to fire, unless I give them the order."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Presently the Malays came to a stop, and the officer hurried back to Harry.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We have heard the sound of footsteps in the wood, and one of my men says he saw a man running among the trees."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It may have been some wild beast," Harry said. "There are plenty of them in the wood, I hear, and your man may have been mistaken in thinking that he saw a human figure. And even if it was so, it might be some villager who, on hearing us, has left the path, thinking us to be enemies."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It may be that," the officer said, when the words were translated to him. "But it is more likely that he was posted there to watch the path, and that he has gone to tell his band that a party is approaching."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Even if it were so," Harry said, "the band may be only a small one."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The officer moved forward, and joined his men. Half an hour later, without the slightest warning, a shower of spears flew from among the trees; followed immediately afterwards by a rush of dark figures. Several of the Malay escort were at once cut down. The rest fled, at full speed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry saw that resistance would be hopeless, and would only ensure their destruction. He therefore called to his followers to remain quiet. The four bearers, however, threw down their burdens, and fled at full speed down the path, just as a number of Malays poured out on either side.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They were evidently struck with the appearance of Harry and his followers; but were about to rush upon them, when a chief ran forward and shouted, to them, to abstain from attacking the strangers. Then he walked up to Harry, who was evidently the chief of the party.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Who are you, white man?" he asked, "and where are you going?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The interpreter replied that they were going on a visit of ceremony to the Rajah of Johore.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We are his enemies," the chief said, "and now you must come with us."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "This lord--" the interpreter began, but the chief waved his hand for him to be silent.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He waited for a quarter of an hour, by which time he was joined by that portion of his followers which had pursued the Malays. Many of them carried human heads in their hands and, by the number of these, Harry saw that very few of his native escort could have escaped. The chief ordered his men to pick up the packages that had been thrown down by the bearers, and then turned off into the forest.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 After a quarter of an hour's walk, they arrived at the spot where a still-smoking fire showed that the band had halted. No pause was made, however, and the party kept on their way and, in two hours' time, reached the foot of a high range of mountains that had been visible from the coast. The climb was a severe one but, in another hour, they came out upon a flat plateau. Here, in a small village, a considerable body of men were gathered; who hailed the arrival of their comrades, with their ghastly triumphs of victory, with loud shouts.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The chief of the band led his captives to a hut, somewhat superior in appearance to the others, in front of which stood a man whose bright attire and ornaments showed him to be a chief of importance.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Who is this white man," he asked, "and these soldiers who are with him?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The officer repeated the description that he had received from the interpreter, whom he pointed out.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Why was this white man going to Johore?" he asked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He was sent by the white lord of India, my lord."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Ask him why he was sent?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I was sent to Johore to ask the rajah if he would grant a trading station to the English."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We want no English on our coast," the chief said. "There are the Dutch, at Malacca--some day we will turn them out.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "So he was bringing presents to Johore, was he?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, my lord; these are the parcels," and he beckoned up the men who carried them.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 These approached, and humbly laid them at the rajah's feet.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have to report, my lord, that there were twenty of Johore's men with him. These we killed."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Did the white man and his soldiers aid them?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, my lord. They stood quiet, and offered no resistance, therefore I brought them to you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You did well. You are sure that none of the Johore men escaped, to carry off the news that we were here?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Quite certain. We have the heads of twenty men, and their officer."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Good! I will examine these things. Put the white man and this Malay into a hut, and the four soldiers into another.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Who is this other man, who is dressed differently?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He is the white officer's servant," the interpreter said.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, he can go with his master, then."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The four troopers were led off in one direction, and Harry and the others in another. It was a hut roughly constructed of bamboos, thatched with broad leaves, while the entrance had no door. The interpreter did not carry arms; those of Harry and Abdool had been removed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Things have turned out badly, Abdool," Harry said.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Very badly, sahib. I do not like the look of that rajah."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Nor do I, Abdool. I am convinced that he means mischief, and we must get away as soon as we can.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Have you got your knife with you? So have I. We must make a way out of the back of this hut."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A group of half a dozen Malays had taken their seats on the ground, at a distance of some fifteen yards from the entrance; but had posted no sentries. Behind it, as they were taken in, Harry noticed that there was a patch of grain, and beyond that rose the forest.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "These knives are no good against bamboo, sahib."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, I know that; but we might cut these rattans which bind them together. In the first place, dig down with your knife, and see if the bamboos are sound underneath. They may have rotted there.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You and I will stand at the entrance," he went on to the interpreter, "then they cannot see in."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Bamboos are quite sound, sahib."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then we must try another way. First cut the rattans--but not in a line with the entrance, a few feet on one side."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The wood was extremely tough, and it was half an hour before Abdool could cut through them, and free three or four of the bamboo poles. While he was doing this, Harry and the interpreter stood talking together, apparently watching the movements of the Malays.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We are going to try and escape," Harry said. "Will you go with us, or remain here? They will certainly kill us, if they overtake us; there is just a chance that they will not kill us, if we stay."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "They will kill us," the man said, confidently. "It may not be today, because the rajah will be looking over his presents, and will be in a good temper; but tomorrow they will come in and kris us. Assuredly I will go with you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When Abdool announced that he had cut through the rattans, Harry joined him, telling the interpreter to wait at the entrance till he called him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What next, master?" Abdool asked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The next thing will be to pull up the bamboos. If you have cut all their lashings, this ought not to be very difficult; but it will make it easier if we cut the ground away, as deep as we can, on this side of them."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Kneeling down, they set to work with their knives and, after half an hour's work, they had laid bare the bottoms of four of the bamboos, which were sunk two feet into the ground.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Now, Abdool, we ought to get them up easily enough."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With their united strength they pulled up a bamboo, replaced it in its position and, one by one, got the other three up, put them in again, and lightly filled in the earth.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Now we can go, at a minute's notice," Harry said. "At any rate, we had better wait till it is dark."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The sun had just set, when they saw the rajah come out of his hut. He gave an order, and the four troopers were brought out, and placed in a line. Four natives took their places behind them, kris in hand.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "They are going to murder them!" Harry exclaimed, in horror.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Now, Abdool, there is not a moment to be lost; it will be our turn, next."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Their guards had all risen to their feet, watching what was going on. Three of the bamboos were plucked up in a moment. This afforded an opening sufficiently large for them to pass through and, keeping the hut between them and the guard, they made their way through the plantation, and dashed into the forest. They heard yells of satisfaction in the village, and Harry had no doubt that the four troopers had been murdered.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They ran at full speed through the forest and, ten minutes later, heard loud shouts of dismay; and had no doubt that a party had been sent to take them out to execution, and had discovered their escape. It was already almost dark, under the thick shade of the trees; but for half an hour they ran on, the Malay in advance, for he could see any obstacles better than they could, the habits and training of his youth having given him experience in such work.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 For a time they had heard loud shouts behind them. These had been useful, in enabling them to keep a straight course. The Malay now turned, and struck off at right angles to the line that they had been pursuing.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We must keep on, for a time," he said. "When they do not overtake us, they will scatter through the forest in all directions."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 For hours they toiled on, sometimes at an easy walk, sometimes breaking into a run. At last the Malay admitted that, for the time, they were safe; and they threw themselves down upon the ground.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Tomorrow," he said, "they will take up the search in earnest, and will track our footsteps. We had better take to a tree, now. It will not be safe to stay here."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The others cordially agreed as, for some time, they had heard the roars of wild beasts, which abounded in these forests; and Harry and Abdool had run with their open knives in their hands, prepared for a sudden attack.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The others will have gone back to the village, long ago," the Malay said, when they had made themselves as comfortable as they could, in the forks of the tree, "except the men who were guarding us. They will not dare venture into the village, for they would fear the rajah's anger, even more than death from a tiger. They will be first in the search, tomorrow morning.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Which way do you wish to go, my lord?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have been thinking it over, as we came. I think that our best plan will be to go on to Johore. Doubtless the road down the coast will be watched. How far from Johore do you think we are?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Not very far," the Malay said. "We have been going in that direction, ever since we first turned--not very straight, perhaps, but certainly in that direction. I think that we cannot be more than five or six miles from the town. It lies between the hills we crossed, and the higher ones beyond. We have been descending a little, all the time."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am afraid that Johore will not be very pleased to see us arriving empty handed, and to learn that the escort he sent us have all been killed. Still, the news that we bring him, that his enemies are not far off, will be useful to him; and we will offer to aid him in the defence of his town, if he is attacked. At any rate, it is a satisfaction to know that we have not very far to go, and have got so good a start of the fellows behind us that they are not likely to overtake us, before we get there."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 More than once, during the night, they heard angry growling at the foot of the tree. Towards morning there was a scraping sound.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That is a leopard, sahib," the Malay said, in alarm; "he is climbing the tree to get at us."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Abdool was sitting immediately below Harry, and the latter called to him to come up beside him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Mount as high as you can, my lord," the Malay said. "The trunk is not so rough, when you get higher; and the beast will find it harder to climb."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We shall do better, here," Harry said. "These two arms, nearly opposite to each other, are just the thing for us.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You go out to the end of one, Abdool, and I will go out to the end of the other. We will climb out as far as we can, and then he will have to follow us very slowly, whichever way he chooses. If he goes for you, I will follow him. If he comes my way, you follow him. When the bough gets thin he won't be able to turn round, and the one behind can give him a sudden stab, which will make him leave go his hold."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 By the time he had finished speaking, they were each far out on their respective branches, and the leopard was close to the fork. It paused a moment, looked at the two men and, after a moment's hesitation, began to crawl out towards Abdool. Harry at once made his way back to the trunk, and then followed the animal.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Abdool had gone out as far as he dared and, holding on tightly, swayed the end of the branch up and down. The leopard, as it approached him, was evidently disconcerted; and clung to the bough, which was scarcely six inches in diameter at the point it had reached. It snarled angrily, as it became conscious that it was being followed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry, feeling convinced that it could not turn, came fearlessly up to it, and then struck his knife into its loin. As the blade was but some four inches long, he had no hope of striking a vital point.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The leopard uttered a roar, and tried to turn and strike at him with one of its forepaws; but the blade again penetrated to its full depth, this time on the other side and, with a start, it lost its footing, clung for a moment to the branch with its forepaws, and strove to regain its hold; but Harry brought his knife down, again and again, on one of its paws.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Abdool, crawling in, quickly struck it under the shoulder and, a moment later, it released its hold and fell heavily through the foliage to the ground. For a time it was heard roaring, and then the sound came only at intervals, and at an increasing distance.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That was a good business, Abdool," Harry said, as they returned to their former post, where the Malay rejoined them.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It was well done, indeed, sahib. When I heard the beast climbing the tree, it seemed to me that, as we had no weapons except these little knives, he would surely make an end of one of us."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The interpreter did not understand Mahratti, in which Abdool and Harry always conversed; but he said in Hindustani:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have seen fights with leopards, my lord, but even with krises, two of my people would hesitate to attack one--they fear them more than tigers--but little did I think that two men, with small knives, could save their lives from one. My blood turned to water, as I saw the beast climbing out on that bough, and you going out after it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have done a good deal of tiger and leopard hunting, in my time," Harry said, "and know that a leopard cannot spring from a bough, unless it is a fairly stout one--stout enough for it to stand with all its paws upon it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, the day is beginning to break. In half an hour's time the sun will be up, and the wild beasts will have all retired to their lairs. I hope we shall see no more of them. It is all very well to fight under such advantages; but on foot, were a tiger hiding near a path, he would be sure to have one of us as we went along. Our knives would not do more than tickle him."
