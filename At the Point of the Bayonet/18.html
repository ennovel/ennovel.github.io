He was placed on a horse and, escorted by ten natives, was taken out of the town and, after a ride of three hours, arrived at the foot of a strong hill fort, perched on a lofty rock. Here the party dismounted. Halfway up the hill they passed through a gate in the lower wall; and then mounted to the fort, where the officer in command received them and, on reading an order from the rajah, conducted the prisoner into a room at the summit of the highest tower. His arms were then unbound, and the governor and soldiers left the room, locking and barring the door behind them. 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 On the way, Harry had thought over his position. It did not seem to him desperate, if only Holkar failed to capture Delhi; and even if he did so, there was still some hope. He had no doubt that the rajah was waiting to see how matters went. If Holkar captured the city, he would probably send him in to him as a pledge of his goodwill; but he might still hesitate, until he saw the issue of the battle that was likely to be fought outside the walls, when the English army arrived there. He had hitherto affected friendship with the English; and had offered no objection, whatever, to the small force being stationed near his town. But, doubtless, the news of the disaster to Colonel Monson's force had shaken him; and convinced him that the English were not invincible, and that Holkar's immense army would inflict a decisive defeat upon them, in which case those who had shown any friendly feeling towards the English would be made to suffer for it--by devastation of their lands, and the loss of their jagheer, if not of their lives. Harry felt, therefore, that the success of the attack on Delhi would probably be as disastrous, to himself, as to all the defenders of the city.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His first impulse was to look out from the loopholes of the tower. On the one side, as he had noticed, the rock fell sheer away from the foot of the wall, to a depth of two or three hundred feet. On the other side he looked down into a courtyard, sixty feet below him. This was surrounded by high and very strong walls, bristling with cannon; and with strong circular bastions at each corner.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Immediately below him was the flat roof of the house occupied by the rajah, when staying at the fort; and round the yard were low buildings, doubtless containing provisions and munitions of war; and some of them allotted to the picked corps who did duty there, the huts for the rest of the garrison being lower down the hill, near the second wall.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In one corner of the room was a door. On trying it, he found it to be unfastened and, opening it, he walked out. There was a flight of narrow stone steps, in what was evidently a projecting turret. Ascending these, he found himself on a flat roof, on the top of the tower. He spent half an hour here, examining carefully the features of the ground and the defences of the fort. The place, though strong, did not approach, in this respect, many of the hill forts that he had seen in the Deccan; and he concluded that a British force of moderate strength could easily effect its capture though, if stoutly held, it could defy native attack.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He then returned to the room below. Half an hour later, some armed natives entered. One of them carried a large bundle of straw, which he threw down in one corner; another bore a dish of rice, and a third a skin of water. They had evidently been told not to address him for, as soon as they had placed their burdens on the ground, they retired without any remark.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "This is bad," Harry said to himself, when they had left. "I would just as lief sleep on straw as on a bed but, if I had had some blankets, I might have made myself a rope; though I don't think it would have reached the roof of the house below, much less to the courtyard, so that idea must be given up. I have heard of fellows working their way through the floors of their cells; but they have taken away my knife, and there is not a scrap of furniture from which I could get some iron to manufacture a tool. There is no concealing a knife, when they bring my food; for it is sure to be as it is today--rice, or some other grain, boiled, and not even a spoon to eat it with.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The door seems the only possible way though, at present, I cannot see where the possibility comes in. It is of solid wood, and strong enough to cage a tiger. Still, if I am to get out, I fancy that it must be through the door."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A closer examination of it did not increase his hopes. Even when he pushed his hardest against it, it did not yield in the slightest degree. He sat down on the straw, and turned over every possible idea in his mind. No scheme of getting out of the difficulty presented itself.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The only chance that I can see is that, instead of four fellows coming up with the man who brings my food, there may be only two. Taking them by surprise, and snatching a weapon from them, I might manage three of them; but I could not even hope to silence five, before they gave the alarm.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I hope that Abdool got away safely. I think that if he did, he was likely, when he had once shaken off pursuit, to come back and try to find out what had become of me. His face could not have been particularly noticed, for I expect the troopers were attacked as soon as I entered that scoundrel's house; and if he took off his uniform, and went in in native dress, there would be little chance of his being recognized. When he finds out where I have been taken, he will no doubt go back to Delhi, and report; but with Holkar within two miles, they have too much on their hands to think of sending to demand my release. If Holkar fails to take the place, and retires as Lake approaches, there will no doubt be a hot pursuit; and certainly they could not send two or three hundred men here. Less than that would be of no good, whatever. The rajah has committed himself, by the murder of my troopers and, as he cannot hope for forgiveness, he would either fly to Oude, or else move in here with his force, with which he would think himself safe from anything short of an army.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is certain that, with such important work on hand, no men can be spared for a rescue expedition. No, there is not a shadow of chance, unless Holkar is defeated."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Having settled this matter in his mind, and decided that no amount of thinking would enable him to see a way of escaping; Harry dismissed the subject from his thoughts, ate his rice, and lay down as soon as it became dark, having had but little rest for the past week.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Two days passed. As he was sitting on the platform over his cell, he heard a distant boom, and knew that Holkar was besieging Delhi. The next day, to his satisfaction, the sound of cannonading was again distinct.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "At any rate," he said to himself, "Holkar has not carried the place by a sudden rush. There is a regularity about the fire that shows that it is deliberate. No doubt they are breaching one of the walls."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Going to the other side of the platform, he saw that a good many of the rajah's followers were standing on the wall, listening to the firing. The wall itself was some thirty-five feet below the spot where he was standing; neither loophole of his cell commanded a view of it, so that a prisoner could hold no conversation with the guard below.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Presently another man came up on to the walls, and approached the group there. He was, like the others, dressed in a small white turban, a short jacket made of unbleached hemp; underneath which was a loose tunic, bound at the waist with a sash, and coming down to the knees. He carried a spear and matchlock, and across his shoulder a small shield was slung. The others did not turn round and, when a few yards from them, he looked up at Harry; and the latter saw, to his delight, that he was Abdool.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry dared not make any gesture that might be noticed; but he nodded his head slightly, and walked to the other side of the platform, where he remained for a short time, and then returned. Abdool looked again in his direction; but continued to talk with the others as to the attack upon the town, and agreed with them that Holkar would make short work of its defenders.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Presently the whole party descended to the courtyard, together. Some of them went down to the lower wall, to talk to their comrades there; but whether Abdool accompanied them, or was still in the fort, Harry could not make out. He did not, indeed, remain long on the platform but, after looking towards Delhi for some little time, he went down to his room.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 It was evident that Abdool had enlisted in the rajah's service; and had, no doubt, been engaged by the governor of the fort. The rajah would be uneasy in his mind, and would assuredly take on any men that presented themselves; in order to strengthen himself, if Holkar failed to take the town; and also to gain the latter's approbation, by joining him with as large a force as possible. Probably Abdool had only enlisted on the previous day; and would, of course, need time to acquaint himself with the fortifications, the position of the guards, and the manner in which he could best communicate with him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry's meals were brought up twice a day, at seven o'clock in the morning and at nightfall. Hitherto he had been quiet and patient, as there was nothing to be done but to await the course of events. Now that he knew Abdool was there, and would certainly endeavour to open communications with him, it was difficult for him to keep quiet; and he passed hours in pacing round and round his room. Occasionally he went up to the roof, but he could see no signs of Abdool; and therefore remained but a short time on the lookout as, were he to keep on watching the courtyard, it might attract notice, and the idea might occur to someone that he was expecting some signal to be made to him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Three days passed without a sign; and then, when the guard came in with his ration, Harry saw that Abdool was one of the number. As he glanced at him, Abdool, who was standing a little way behind the others, shook his head, and retired with them. Harry felt a momentary disappointment; but saw at once that nothing could be attempted in broad daylight; and that it was at night, only, that there was a possibility of success. He thought that Abdool had only come up in order to see the nature of the fastenings of the doors, and the general position.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He was not with the party who came up in the evening but, in the centre of his rice, Harry found a small piece of paper rolled into a ball. There was not, however, light enough to enable him to read it; but he lay awake half the night and, at the first gleam of daylight, went up on to the platform and, seating himself so that he was not visible from below, waited till he could see to read the letter. It was, of course, in Mahratti; and so badly written that he had difficulty in deciphering it. He finally, however, made it out.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Tomorrow evening, when I come up, we will attack the others, if all goes well; if not, will try the next evening."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 So intent was he, in deciphering the writing, that he had hardly noticed the outburst of heavy firing in the distance. He had feared the enemy had captured Delhi on the previous day, as he had heard no firing; but now the roar of cannon was very heavy, and he had no doubt that Holkar was trying to take the town by assault.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In less than half an hour the sound ceased, suddenly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "They have either taken the town, or been beaten off decisively," he said to himself.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In the afternoon he saw a party of horsemen approaching, followed by some palanquins.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That looks hopeful," he said to himself. "A messenger has probably brought the rajah news that the assault has failed, and he is bringing his zenana here for safety, until he hears the issue of the battle, which will probably take place in a day or two. I wonder whether this will upset Abdool's plans!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The rajah's return was greeted by the discharge of matchlocks. Presently, however, this was succeeded by cries of rage and a clamour of voices.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Holkar has been thrashed. Now it is a toss up whether the rajah will, in his anger, send up and have me brought down and executed. I think the chances are in my favour. The fellow is evidently crafty, or he would not have persuaded Ochterlony that he was friendly towards us; and I think he will hold me as a sort of hostage so that, if Holkar is defeated, he may make favourable terms for himself by offering to surrender me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 It was not until an hour later that Harry heard a party ascending the stairs. When the door opened, he saw that two of the men carried torches. Abdool, who was in the rear, closed the door behind him, and then said, "Now sahib!" and struck down the man in front of him with his tulwar.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry had risen to his feet, as he heard the men coming; and had braced himself up for a spring, when Abdool gave the word. With a blow straight from the shoulder, he struck the man carrying the dish senseless to the floor; tore the sword from his sash; warded off a hasty blow delivered by one torch bearer, who was too much astonished at the sudden attack to act with decision, and cut him down; while, at the same moment, Abdool almost severed the neck of the other.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Thanks, Abdool," Harry said, grasping his follower's hand, "you have saved my life!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Not yet, sahib. Our work has but begun. There are other dangers to be met. However, the arrival of the rajah has been fortunate. The news he has brought has--but first, let me finish the man you knocked down."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "There is no occasion for that. Tear his sash into strips, and bind his hands and feet; and gag him with his own turban.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Now, what is our next step?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have a rope round my body, sahib, to lower ourselves on to the ramparts. I am wearing an extra suit of clothes, so that you can get up as one of the garrison. I think we have plenty of time, for it is not likely that these men will be missed. Everyone is too excited by the news, that Holkar has failed to take Delhi, to notice whether we return or not."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He took off the outer garment that he had brought with him, while Harry removed his uniform and attired himself in it and, placing the turban of one of the soldiers on his head, possessed himself of a shield, spear, and dagger, and then said:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What next, Abdool?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We will put out these torches, sahib,"--these were still burning on the floor--"the light might be noticed from below, and they might wonder why we stayed here so long."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Are there any guards on the walls?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, sahib; they have them on the lower wall, but not here."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The torches were extinguished, and then they went up to the platform above. They fastened one end of the rope to the battlement, having first tied knots at short intervals.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I will go down first on to the wall, sahib; and if by chance any man may have come up from below, which is not likely, I can hide," and he at once commenced to lower himself down.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In two or three minutes, Abdool was joined by Harry. The courtyard was dark, save that a few torches burned here and there. A great babble of talking was going on, and the windows of the rajah's house were lighted up.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What are your plans, Abdool? I see that we shall be able to get through the gates, here, without fear of discovery. Is the gate through the other wall shut?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, sahib, it is always closed at sunset. Except where the road comes up to the gate, there is only one place where the rock projects at the foot of the wall, and there is a possibility of climbing down. That was where I had intended we should cross the wall. The height is but twenty feet, there, and I have another rope of that length. There are no sentries placed, except over the gate.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is quite possible that, even there, there is none tonight. There is no order among these fellows, as there is among the Company's troops and, as there is no enemy near, they think that such a watch is unnecessary; and if any have been sent there, they are pretty sure to have gone to the huts, to talk over the news from Delhi. The matter should be easy enough.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We may as well start at once. These fellows will quieten down presently, and will then be more likely to hear any noise we may make."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Looking about, they went down by the stairs leading to the courtyard and walked carelessly across. Taking care to avoid mingling with the excited groups and, at the same time, keeping as far from the torches burning in the courtyard as possible, they passed through the gate--which was standing open without a guard--and followed the zigzag road, with towers placed at its corners, each mounting two guns so as to sweep the approach.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 There were two high walls on either hand, loopholed for musketry; and Abdool said that there was a platform, wide enough for two men to pass, along the whole length of it. The road terminated in a heavy gate, some forty yards above that through the outer wall. A bastion covered it so that, were the lower gate carried, an enemy would not be able to bring guns to bear against it. This gate stood open and, passing through it and behind the bastion, they came at once upon the low, stone-built huts where the majority of the garrison lived, in time of peace.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Several torches were burning here, and round each of these were groups of men, talking excitedly. Leaving Harry behind one of the huts, Abdool strolled up for a few minutes, to listen to the conversation, and then rejoined his master.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What are they saying, Abdool?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "They are saying, sir, that it was wrong of Holkar to attack the city, before he had defeated the English. It has cost many lives. But when the English are defeated he will be able, without doubt, to capture the city; which probably would open its gates to him, seeing that no assistance could come to them."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No one doubts, then, that Holkar will defeat us?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Not in the least," Abdool replied. "They say that he has two hundred cannon. These will mow down the English. Then the cavalry will charge, and there will be an end of the matter."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "They seem to have forgotten all about Laswaree," Harry said. "But we had better be going. Where is the way up to the wall?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Close by, sahib."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They ascended the steps. As far as could be seen the wall was entirely deserted, and they made their way cautiously until close to the gate. Harry then stopped, and Abdool went on with noiseless tread. He soon returned.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is as I thought: no sentries are yet posted."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But that tower over the gate, Abdool, is a great deal too high for us to descend by that rope that you have got."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, sahib. We go out by an entrance on to a bastion, flanking the gate. The rope will be long enough there or, at any rate, there will be but a very short drop."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They entered the tower through the door communicating with the wall. Abdool led the way.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Keep close to me, sahib. I went down here this morning, and can find my way in the dark. I did not think that there was much chance of our coming this way, but it was better to find out all about it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Moving slowly and cautiously, they came to a flight of steps. They descended some twenty feet, and found themselves at an open portal, leading on to the flanking bastion. The rope was soon fixed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I will go first, sahib, and will let you know how far you will have to drop; for the wall looks, to me, higher than it was at the point where I intended to descend."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;Illustration: Abdool at once slipped down.
</div> 
<div>
 It was tied round the neck of a gun, and Abdool at once slipped down. There was a pause, then a slight dull sound, and the rope hung loose.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The knot at the end is ten feet from the ground," Abdool said, in a low tone.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That is near enough," Harry replied, and then he swung himself over.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When he came to the last knot, he lowered himself to the full length of his arms and let go. The fall was not much more than a yard; and Abdool stood close by, ready to catch him, should he miss his foothold on alighting.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They at once started, at a rapid pace, down the hill. They had nearly reached the plain when the deep note of a horn was heard.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That is the alarm!" Harry exclaimed. "They have found out that I have gone."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "They will soon be after us, but there is no fear of their catching us," Abdool said, as they broke into a trot. "No one will know, at first, what has happened. Everyone will run to his post; then they will have to search the fort, and all the ground between it and the lower wall. All that will take time. It may be an hour before horsemen start.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I did not think that they would miss you till tomorrow morning."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I suppose the rajah sent up for me, to amuse himself by threatening me. He would hardly venture to do more, until he is sure that Holkar has defeated us. However, as you say, there is very little chance of their catching us."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As soon as they were down on the plain, Harry went on:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We had better strike north, for an hour or two. They are sure to ride across the plain in the direction of Delhi, thinking we shall make straight for the city."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That will be best, sahib."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Fortunately the rain had ceased, and the sky was cloudless, so that they were able to direct their course by the stars. For two hours they kept due north, and then turned west. It was a long journey from the point where they turned. Harry calculated that it would be nearly fifty miles. The fort was some fifteen miles northeast of Sekerah, and they were now farther away from Delhi than they had been when they started. He felt the advantage of the light native dress, and the sandals that Abdool had given him instead of his boots.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When they came across cultivated ground they walked; but a great portion of the country was a sandy waste; with the ruins of villages and temples that had, in the palmy days of the empire, stood there. Across this they went at a trot, for the sand was generally compact enough to sustain their weight.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We shall hardly get there before day breaks, sahib," Abdool remarked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No; but that is of little consequence. Probably, by this time, Holkar will have marched away--either to give battle or, what is more likely, to recruit; and for many miles round Delhi the country will be rejoicing, at having been spared the ruin that would have befallen it, had he taken the city. So I have no fear that we shall be hindered on the way; for though they may wonder at my appearance--for the dye has now almost worn off, and anyone can see that I am a white--they will be all the more willing to render us any assistance.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "There is no fear of the rajah's horsemen keeping up the pursuit, beyond halfway between Sekerah and the city; for they must know that all the zemindars and people round it are in our favour, and that they might be attacked, when beyond the limits of the rajah's jagheer."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When morning broke they could see, in the distance, the minarets of Delhi.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "They must be ten miles away, Abdool, and I will enter the next house we come to. I fancy, from our position, we must be close to the residence of the zemindar who, at once, brought in a force of fifty men to aid in the defence of the town. There we are sure of hospitable treatment and, indeed, I sorely need rest and food. I have eaten nothing since yesterday morning and, counting the distance we made to the north after leaving the fort, we must have walked nearly fifty miles."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Half a mile farther they saw a house, and made straight for it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Is Shuja Khan within?" Harry asked an armed retainer standing at the entrance.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The soldier recognized Harry--having seen him when he called upon his master--and replied:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He returned last night, my lord."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Will you tell him that Captain Lindsay, who was treacherously captured by the Rajah of Sekerah, has just escaped, and is on his way to the city; and that he asks for his hospitality?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Enter, my lord," the man said, salaaming deeply. "Our master will, I am sure, gladly receive you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He showed Harry into a large room where, a few minutes later, the zemindar joined him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Peace be with you, sahib! I am rejoiced to see you in safety; for I heard, at Delhi, that you had not returned, and there were fears that ill had befallen you and your escort."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "My escort were killed, and I myself carried a prisoner to the rajah's hill fort; and I have owed my escape to the faithfulness of my servant, who got away when the others were massacred and, disguising himself, got into the fort and contrived my escape."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "All honour be to him!" the zemindar said. "Then you have walked all night?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes; we went ten miles to the north first, knowing that we should be pursued; for we heard the alarm given, just after we started. We have walked fifty miles and, when I say that I have eaten nothing since yesterday morning, you may be sure that we are sorely in need of refreshment."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It shall be got ready, at once, sahib; and, while it is being prepared, you can take a bath and a change of garments."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I need the bath almost as much as I need a feed," Harry laughed. "I have just been looking into the glass, and I see that I am well-nigh as dark as when I came to you, nine or ten days ago."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His host led him to a room containing a bath, which was soon filled by the servants, one of whom brought in a handsome suit of the zemindar's clothes. It was more than half an hour before he went down again. As soon as he entered the room, a servant brought in a meal; consisting of slices of meat on a skewer, and a pillau of chicken.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The zemindar sat by while he ate his meal, and Harry gave him a short account of the manner in which he had effected his escape. The former, in turn, related the events of the siege; adding that spies had brought in the news, late in the afternoon, that Holkar would march away in the morning, as he had heard that the English army was but two days distant.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Was he going to meet the English, or to retire towards Malwar?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That I cannot say, sahib, for the spies could not tell us. Doubtless he and his army are much dispirited, at their failure to take the city. But the general opinion of the townspeople was that he would give battle, be victorious, and would return and continue the siege."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have no fear of his being victorious. He knows, in the battles of Assaye and Poona, how Scindia was utterly routed; and how, at Laswaree and Delhi, the Mahrattas were scattered; and I do not think that he will venture upon giving battle. But if he does, I have no fear, whatever, of the result. It was more than his whole army could do to break up Monson's force, although composed entirely of native infantry, until it was near Agra. This time there will be British infantry and cavalry, and the Mahrattas will never stand against their charge."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry had already enquired about Abdool, and found that he had also had a meal, and was now asleep.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Now, sahib," Shuja said, "it were best that you should rest, for a time. There will be nought doing in Delhi today and, after the heat of the day is over, we can supply you with horses and an escort."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry accepted the invitation, for he was stiff and sore from his exertions. The man showed him to a room that had been prepared for him, and he was soon fast asleep. He did not awake until the sun was getting low. He at once went downstairs.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The horses are ready," the zemindar said, "but I pray you to take a meal, before mounting. It is ready, and will be served directly."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry, who had been too tired to do justice to his food in the morning, was by no means sorry to take another meal. As he rose to go, he thanked the zemindar most heartily for his kindness.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is an honour that you have bestowed upon me," the zemindar said, courteously. "You and your brave countrymen are fighting to free us from the oppression of the Mahrattas, and any one of your race would meet with a hearty welcome here."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The horses were now brought round. The one intended for Harry was a very handsome animal, richly caparisoned.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is a fine horse, indeed," he said, as he was about to mount.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The horse is yours, sahib," Shuja Khan said. "He is of good breed, and will carry you far and fast. I shall esteem it a great honour that you should ride him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do not thank me, I pray you. 'Tis but a little thing to do, for one of our brave defenders; of whose deeds one of your officers was telling me, when he was deploring your loss."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I thank you most heartily, Khan; and, after the manner in which you have given it, I cannot refuse so handsome a present. I shall be proud to ride such an animal; and you may be sure that, as I do so, I shall often think of him who presented it to me; and shall assuredly mention, to Colonel Ochterlony, the very great kindness with which you have received me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As he rode off, followed by an escort of four of the zemindar's retainers, he saw with satisfaction that Abdool was also attired in clean white garments.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You have done well, I hope, Abdool?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have been well treated, indeed, sahib, and the zemindar's head man told me that I was to consider the horse on which I ride my own. He will carry me well, for he is a stout and serviceable animal. I was wondering what we should do for horses; for there are but few in the city, as most of those owning them sent them away, with their valuables, on hearing of Holkar's approach."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The zemindar is a generous man, indeed. He has, as you heard, presented me with the horse that I am riding. It is certainly a splendid animal and, though my own was a good one, this is far better. In fact, I have seen no handsomer horse, anywhere.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I wish you had as good a one, Abdool, and then we need not fear being overtaken, though half the Mahratta army were in pursuit."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They entered the city by the northern gate, and saw nothing of the enemy, who were encamped on the other side of the city. Harry was most warmly received by Colonel Ochterlony.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have been in much anxiety about you," he said. "That you had been detained was certain; but I hoped that that petty rajah would not have ventured to harm you, for he would be sure that, sooner or later, we should have a heavy reckoning with him."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I fancy, sir, that he was waiting for news from here. He was convinced that Holkar would take the city, and defeat Lord Lake. Had he done so, I have no doubt that he would either have sent me prisoner to him, or would have despatched me and forwarded only my head. As I felt certain that things would not turn out as he stated, I had no great fear for my life; but I thought that I might have been kept a prisoner for a very long time, for Lord Lake would have his hands full in other directions."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then he released you on the news that Holkar had failed to capture the city?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, sir; I got away owing to the fidelity of my orderly who, after riding off himself, when the two troopers with me were attacked and killed, entered a hill fort where I was confined, took service there, and contrived my escape. I shall hand in a report with the details, for your perusal, when things have quietened down a bit. My man has rendered me other valuable services, and I should be greatly pleased if, in consideration of the fidelity and daring that he has shown, you would think fit to recommend him for promotion as a native officer. He belongs to the 3rd Bombay Cavalry."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I should certainly have pleasure in doing so, Captain Lindsay. I shall, of course, be drawing up a list of the zemindars and others who have rendered service, and recommending them for reward to the Government. If you will give me the particulars as to the man's name and services I will include him in the list. He has been with you some time, has he not?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, sir, for upwards of six years. He accompanied me from Calcutta to Nagpore, when I went on a mission to the rajah, whom it was desirable to keep neutral until the war in Mysore was brought to an end. He was at Assaye, and journeyed in disguise across the country with me, to carry the news of that victory to General Lake. He took part with me in the cavalry charge at Laswaree, and in the retreat of Colonel Monson's column."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That is quite good enough," Colonel Ochterlony said. "But I should think that it would be the shortest and best way for you to recommend him direct to Lord Lake, who would be able to put him in orders at once. At the same time, I will send to Calcutta a recommendation that some special reward should be granted to him. There will be a large number of forfeitures of the estates of those who have sided with Scindia and Holkar. I make no doubt that, on my strong recommendation, he will obtain a grant of the revenue of a village or two. Such a grant would do good by showing that instances of fidelity, even in the case of a private soldier, do not go unnoticed or unrewarded. We expect the general's arrival here in a couple of days."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I shall be very glad, sir, if only because my uniform is coming on with his baggage. At present, with my white face and this showy native dress, I feel that I am stared at by everyone I meet. The uniform that Captain Ewart lent me I had to leave behind, when I made my escape."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It will not inconvenience him, poor fellow," the colonel said, "for he was almost cut in two, by a cannon shot, as the enemy advanced to the last assault."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When the general arrived within three miles of the city, Harry rode out to his camp and, having first obtained his uniform, went in to report himself.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "So you got through safely, Captain Lindsay? I supposed that you had, when the news reached us that Delhi was defending itself stoutly for, had they not had some days warning, they could hardly have held out for an hour."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "This is Colonel Burns's report of the military operations of the siege, sir; and this is a letter from the Resident; and this is my own report, of my doings since I left you at Agra."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Thank you, Captain Lindsay. I shall have a communication to send to Colonel Ochterlony this afternoon, and should be obliged if you will carry it for me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry bowed and left; and then joined the officers of the staff, who were just sitting down to lunch, and were all glad to see him again.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "So you managed to get through Holkar's lines, Lindsay?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, yes! I met with no difficulty, and only fell in once with any of his troops. I spent an evening with their officer, and after that rode through without interruption. There was really no danger, and I do not think Holkar, himself, could have suspected me of being a British officer."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And now, about the siege. You may imagine that we were all very anxious about it; for though, of course, we should soon have retaken the place, there would have been a general plunder and massacre by that brute Holkar."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You must wait for particulars until you get there," Harry said, "for I know nothing about it whatever, except what I have heard."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And how is that?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I was, at the time, a prisoner in the hands of the petty Rajah of Sekerah. He promised to send in three hundred men. The day before Holkar arrived, I was sent to urge him to despatch them instantly to aid in the defence. He was evidently impressed with the idea that Holkar was going to retake the place without any difficulty, and would afterwards annihilate our army; so, thinking that was the winning side, he arrested me, and sent me off to a hill fort, fifteen miles away, and murdered my two troopers."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And how did you get away?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry gave an account of the manner in which Abdool had managed his escape.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Such a fellow as that is a jewel."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He is indeed, Major; and I would not part with him for any money. He came round with me from Bombay to Calcutta, six years ago, and has ridden with me ever since. He fought most gallantly, in the Malay Peninsula and at many other places. In my report, to the general, of my last adventure I have mentioned his services with me in my various journeys, and have strongly recommended his promotion."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He well deserves it," the major said. "He has, like you, carried his life in his hand for, if he had been detected, undoubtedly he would have shared your fate."
