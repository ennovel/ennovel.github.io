In the centre was a large pavilion; the residence, for the time, of Major Lindsay, an officer whose charge was to keep the peace in the district. It was no easy matter. The inhabitants, wild and lawless, lived in small villages scattered about the rough country, for the most part covered with forest, and subject to depredations by the robber bands who had their strongholds among the hills. Major Lindsay had with him a party of twenty troopers, not for defence--there was little fear of attack by the natives of the Concan--but to add to his authority, to aid in the collection of the small tax paid by each community, and to deter the mountain robbers from descending on to the plain. He generally spent the cool season in going his rounds while, during the hot weather, his headquarters were at Bombay. 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He had with him his wife and infant child. The child was some three months old, and was looked after by an ayah, who had been in Major Lindsay's service ten years; for three elder children had been born to him--all, however, dying from the effects of the climate before reaching the age of five. The ayah had nursed each, in succession, and had become greatly attached to the family, especially to her youngest charge. She had come to speak English well; but with the child she always talked in her native tongue, as the major saw the advantage it would prove to the boy, when he grew up, to be able to speak fluently one, at least, of the native languages.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The nurse was a Mahratta. She had been in the service of the British Resident at Poona and, when he was recalled, had entered that of Major Lindsay, at that time a captain who acted as secretary to the Resident.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A young officer from Bombay had just ridden out, to spend a day or two with the major, and was sitting with him at the entrance to the tent.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The news from the army," he said, "is most unsatisfactory. As you know, to the astonishment of everyone Colonel Egerton was appointed to the command, in spite of the fact that he was so infirm as to be altogether unfit for active service; and Mostyn, our late Resident at Poona, and Carnac accompanied him as deputies of the Council."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That is altogether a bad arrangement," the major said. "It has always been a great disadvantage for a general to be accompanied by civilians, with power to thwart his combinations. Against Mostyn's appointment no one could raise any objection as, having been for some years at Poona, he understands the Mahrattas, and indeed is much liked by them, so that in any negotiations he would have far more chance of success than a stranger; but Carnac is hot headed and obstinate, with a very high idea of his own importance, and it is certain that there will be difficulties between him and Egerton."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am sorry to say, Major, that these anticipations were very speedily verified. As you know, the advance party landed at Aptee, on November 23rd, and seized the roads over the gorge; and on the 25th the main body disembarked at Panwell. No sooner had they got there than there was a quarrel between Egerton and Carnac. Most unfortunately Mostyn, who would have acted as mediator, was taken ill on the very day after landing, and was obliged to return to Bombay; and I hear there is hardly any chance of his recovery. The army did not reach the top of the Ghauts till the 23rd of December--instead of, at the latest, three days after landing--and actually spent eleven days before it arrived at Karlee, only eight miles in advance of the Bhore Ghauts. Of course this encouraged the enemy, and gave plenty of time for them to assemble and make all their arrangements and, when we last heard, they were harassing our march. For the past two days no news has arrived, and there seems to be little doubt that the Mahrattas have closed in round their rear, and cut off all communications."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is monstrous that they should march so slowly. The whole thing has been a hideous blunder, and the idea of encumbering a force of four thousand men with something like thirty thousand camp followers, and with a train of no less than nineteen thousand bullocks, to say nothing of other draught animals, is the most preposterous thing I ever heard of. In fact, the whole thing has been grossly mismanaged.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I don't say that the conduct of the Mahrattas has not for some time been doubtful, if not threatening. It is well known that the Governor General and the Council at Calcutta have most strongly disapproved of the whole conduct of the Council at Bombay. Indeed, no explanation has ever been given as to why they took up the cause of Rugoba, the scoundrel who grasped the crown; and who was privy to, if he did not instigate, the murder of his nephew, the young Peishwa.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He was not unopposed, for Nana Furnuwees and Hurry Punt, two of the leading Mahratta ministers, formed a regency under Gunga Bye, the widow of the murdered Peishwa. While matters were undecided, the Bombay Council opened communications with Rugoba, who they thought was likely to be successful; and promised to assist him, if he would advance a considerable sum of money, and cede to the Company Salsette, the small islands contiguous to Bombay and Bassein, which had been captured from the Portuguese by the Mahrattas--an altogether inexcusable arrangement, as the Mahrattas were at peace with us, and Rugoba was not in a position to hand the islands over. That matter, however, was settled by sending an expedition, which captured Salsette and Tannah in 1775, four years ago. Since then Rugoba has become a fugitive and, without a shadow of reason, is making war against the whole force of the Mahratta confederacy; who, although divided amongst themselves and frequently engaged in the struggles for supremacy, have united against us--for they say that Scindia, Holkar, and Hurry Punt are in command of their army. To send four thousand men, of whom less than six hundred are Europeans, against the whole Mahratta power is a desperate step.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I know we have fought and won against greater odds, many times in the history of India; but our forces have always been well led, marched with the smallest amount of baggage possible, and made up for inferiority in numbers by speed, activity, and dash. Here, on the contrary, we have a force hampered to an unheard-of degree by baggage and camp followers; with an invalid at its head, controlled by two civilians; and moving at a rate which, in itself, testifies to divided councils and utter incompetency on the part of its commander. It is almost impossible even to hope for success, under such conditions."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The lookout is certainly bad," the younger officer agreed. "However, before now the fighting powers of the British soldier have made up for the blunders of his commanders; and we may hope that this will be the case, now."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "If a disaster happen," the major said, "we shall have the Mahrattas down at the gates of Bombay; and as soon as I hear a rumour of it--and news travels wonderfully fast among the natives--I shall return to the city."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, I don't think you need fear anything of that sort, Major! Besides, this is not on the direct line between the Ghauts and the city. And even if they find they cannot push on, I should say our force would be able to secure their retreat. The Mahratta horse will never be able to break our squares; but of course, in that case we should have to abandon all our baggage and baggage animals."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I agree with you that the Mahrattas would doubtless hang on the skirts of our force, and follow them down the Bhore Ghaut, and so would not come anywhere near us; but they might detach flying parties to burn and plunder, as is their custom. Brave as they are, the Mahrattas do not fight for the love of fighting, but simply from the hope of plunder and of enlarging their territories.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, we may hope, in a day or two, to hear that a battle has been fought, and that a victory has been won. Not that one victory would settle the matter, for the Mahratta force consists almost entirely of cavalry and, as we have only a handful, they would, if beaten, simply ride off and be ready to fight again, another day. If we had pushed on and occupied Poona, directly we landed--which should have been easy enough, if the baggage train had been left behind, for it is but forty miles from Panwell to the Mahratta capital--the position would have been altogether different. The Mahrattas would not have had time to collect their forces, and we should probably have met with no opposition and, once in Poona, could have held it against the whole Mahratta force. Besides, it is certain that some of the chiefs, seeing that Rugoba was likely to be made Peishwa, would have come to the conclusion that it would be best for them to side with him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Of course, the baggage should all have been left at Panwell and, in that case, the force could have entered Poona three days after landing, instead of delaying from the 25th of November until today, the 7th of January; and even now, at their present rate of advance, they may be another fortnight before they arrive at Poona. I don't think there has been so disgraceful a business since we first put foot in India.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "At any rate, I shall send Mary and the child down to Bombay, tomorrow. It is all very well to have her with me, when everything is peaceable; but although I do not think there is any actual risk, it is as well that, in turbulent times like these, with nothing but a force under such incompetent leading between us and a powerful and active enemy, she should be safe at Bombay."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Just before daybreak, next morning, there was a sudden shout from one of the sentries; who had for the first time been posted round the camp. The warning was followed by a fierce rush, and a large body of horse and foot charged into the camp. The escort were, for the most part, killed as they issued from their tents. The major and his friend were shot down as they sallied out, sword in hand. The same fate befell Mrs. Lindsay.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Then the Mahrattas proceeded to loot the camp. The ayah had thrust the child underneath the wall of the tent, at the first alarm. A Mahratta seized her, and would have cut her down, had she not recognized him by the light of the lamp which hung from the tent ridge.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Why, cousin Sufder," she exclaimed, "do you not know me?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He loosed his hold, and stood back and gazed at her.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Why, Soyera," he exclaimed, "is it you? It is more than ten years since I saw you!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is my cousin," he said to some of his companions who were standing round, "my mother's sister's child."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Don't be alarmed," he went on, to the woman, "no one will harm you. I am one of the captains of this party."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I must speak to you alone, Sufder."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She went outside the tent with him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You have nothing to fear," he said. "You shall go back with us to Jooneer. I have a house there, and you can stay with my wife. Besides, there are many of your people still alive."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But that is not all, Sufder. I was ayah to the major and his wife--whom your people have just killed, and whom I loved dearly--and in my charge is their child. He is but a few months old, and I must take him with me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is impossible," Sufder replied. "No white man, woman, or child would be safe in the Deccan, at present."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No one would see his face," the woman said. "I would wrap him up, and will give out that he is my own child. As soon as we get up the Ghauts I would stain his face and skin, and no one would know that he was white. If you will not let me do it, tell your men to cut me down. I should not care to live, if the child were gone as well as his father and mother. You cannot tell how kind they were to me. You would not have me ungrateful, would you, Sufder?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, well," the man said good naturedly, though somewhat impatiently, "do as you like; but if any harm comes of it, mind it is not my fault."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Thankful for the permission, Soyera hurried round to the back of the tent, picked up the child and wrapped it in her robe; and then when, after firing the place, the Mahrattas retired, she fell in behind them, and followed them in the toilsome climb up the mountains, keeping so far behind that none questioned her. Once or twice Sufder dropped back to speak to her.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is a foolish trick of yours," he said, "and I fear that trouble will come of it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I don't see why it should," she replied. "The child will come to speak Mahratta and, when he is stained, none will guess that he is English. In time, I may be able to restore him to his own people."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The other shook his head.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That is not likely," he said, "for before many weeks, we shall have driven them into the sea."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then he must remain a Mahratta," she said, "until he is able to make his way to join the English in Madras or Calcutta."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You are an obstinate woman, and always have been so; else you would not have left your people to go to be servant among the whites. However, I will do what I can for you, for the sake of my mother's sister and of our kinship."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 On the way up the hills Soyera stopped, several times, to pick berries. When they halted she went aside and pounded them, and then boiled them in some water in a lota--a copper vessel--Sufder lent her for the purpose, and dyed the child's head and body with it, producing a colour corresponding to her own.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The party, which was composed of men from several towns and villages, broke up the next morning.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Have you money?" Sufder asked her, as she was about to start alone on her journey.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes; my savings were all lodged for me, by Major Lindsay, with some merchants at Bombay; but I have twenty rupees sewn up in my garments."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "As to your savings, Soyera, you are not likely to see them again, for we shall make a clean sweep of Bombay. However, twenty rupees will be useful to you, and would keep you for three or four months, if you needed but, as you are going to my wife, you will not want them.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Take this dagger. When you show it to her, she will know that you come from me; but mind, she is, like most women, given to gossip; therefore I warn you not to let her into the secret of this child's birth, for if you did so, half the town would know it in the course of a day or two.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Now, I must go back with my men to join a party who are on their way to fight the English. I should have gone there direct, but met the others starting on this marauding expedition, which was so much to the taste of my men that I could not restrain them from joining. I shall see you at Jooneer, as soon as matters are finished with the English; then I shall, after staying a few days there, rejoin Scindia, in whose service I am."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Soyera started on her way. At the villages through which she passed, she was questioned as to where she came from; and replied that she had been living down near Bombay but, now that the English were going to fight the Mahrattas, she was coming home, having lost her husband a few months before.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As the road to Jooneer diverged widely from that to Poona, she was asked no questions about the war. All were confident that the defeat of the English was certain, now that Scindia and Holkar and the government of the Peishwa had laid aside their mutual jealousies, and had joined for the purpose of crushing the whites.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 On arriving, after two days' journey, at Jooneer, she went to the address that Sufder had given her; but was coldly received by his wife.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "As it is Sufder's order, of course I must take you in," she said, "but when he returns, I shall tell him that I do not want another woman and child in the house. Why do you not go to your own people? As you are Sufder's cousin, you must be the sister of Ramdass. Why should you not go to him?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I will gladly do so, if you will tell me where he lives."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He has a small farm. You must have passed it, as you came along. It is about a mile from here."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I will go to him at once," Soyera said.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, no," the woman exclaimed; "that will never do. You must stop a day or two here. Sufder would be angry, indeed, were he to find that you did not remain here; and would blame me for it. I should be willing enough for you to stay a week, or a month; that is a different thing from becoming an inmate of the house."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I will wait till tomorrow, for I have made a long two days' journey from the top of the Ghauts and, as I am not accustomed to walking, my feet are sore. In the morning I will go and see my brother. I did not so much as know that he was alive. I feel sure he will take me in, willingly; for he is but two years older than myself, and was always kind to me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Accordingly the next morning she retraced her steps, and had no difficulty in finding the farm of Ramdass. Choosing the time when he would be likely to be in for his dinner, Soyera walked up to the door of the house, which was standing open.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As she stood there, hesitating, Ramdass came out. He was a man of some forty years of age, with a pleasant and kindly face. He looked at her enquiringly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you not know me, Ramdass?" she asked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Why, 'tis Soyera!" he exclaimed. "And so you have come back, after all these years--thirteen, is it not, since you went away?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Welcome back, little sister!" and he raised his voice, and called, "Anundee!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A young woman, two or three and twenty years of age, came to the door.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Wife," he said, "this is my sister Soyera, of whom you have often heard me speak.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Soyera, this is my wife. We have been married six years; but come in, and let us talk things over.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You have come home for good, I hope," he said. "So you too have married and, as you come alone with your child, have, I suppose, had the misfortune to lose your husband?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, I was alone in the world, and came hither not knowing whether you were alive or dead; but feeling sure of a welcome, if I found you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And you were not mistaken," he said heartily.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Anundee, you will, I am sure, join me in the welcome; and willingly give my sister and her child a place in our home?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Assuredly. It will be pleasant for me, when you are in the fields, to have some one to talk to, and perhaps to help me about the house."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Soyera saw that she was speaking sincerely.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Thank you, Anundee; you may be sure that I shall not be idle. I have been accustomed to work, and can take much off your hands; and will look after your two children;" for two boys, three or four years old, were standing before her, staring at the newcomer.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That will be pleasant, Soyera; indeed, sometimes they hinder me much in my work."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am accustomed to children, Anundee, as I was for years nurse to English children, and know their ways."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, now let us to dinner," Ramdass broke in. "I am hungry, and want to be off again. There is much to do in the fields."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The woman took a pot off the embers of a wood fire, and poured its contents into a dish. The meal consisted of a species of pulse boiled with ghee, with peppers and other condiments added.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And how did you like being among the English, Soyera?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I liked it very well," the woman said. "They are very kind and considerate to nurses and, although they get angry when the gorrawallah or other men neglect their duty, they do not punish them as a Mahratta master would do. They are not double faced; when they say a thing they mean it, and their word can always be trusted. As a people, no doubt they are anxious to extend their dominion; but they do not wish to do so for personal gain. They are not like the princes here, who go to war to gain territory and revenue. It was reasonable that they should wish to increase their lands; for they are almost shut up in Bombay, with Salsette and the other islands occupied by us, who may, any day, be their enemies."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Her brother laughed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It seems to me, Soyera, that you have come to prefer these English people to your own countrymen."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I say not that, Ramdass. You asked me how I liked them, and I have told you. You yourself know how the tax collectors grind down the people; how Scindia and Holkar and the Peishwa are always fighting each other. Do you know that, in Bombay, the meanest man could not be put to death, unless fairly tried; while among the Mahrattas men are executed on the merest excuse or, if not executed, are murdered?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That is true enough," Ramdass said; "none of the three princes would hesitate to put to death anyone who stood in his way, and it seems strange to me that even the Brahmins, who would not take the life even of a troublesome insect, yet support the men who have killed scores of other people. But it is no use grumbling; the thing has always been, and I suppose always will be. It is not only so in the Deccan, but in the Nizam's dominions, in Mysore and, so far as I know, in Oude and Delhi. It seems so natural to us that the powerful should oppress the weak, and that one prince should go to war with another, that we hardly give the matter a thought; but though, as you say, the English in Bombay may rule wisely, and dislike taking life, they are doing now just as our princes do--they are making war with us."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That is true but, from what I have heard when the English sahibs were speaking together, it is everything to them that a prince favourable to them should rule at Poonah for, were Holkar and Scindia to become all powerful, and place one of their people on the seat of the Peishwa, the next step might be that a great Mahratta force would descend the Ghauts, capture Bombay, and slay every white man in it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But they are a mere handful," Ramdass said. "How can they think of invading a nation like ours?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Because they know, at least they believe, that Scindia, Holkar, and the Peishwa are all so jealous of each other that they will never act together. Then you see what they have done round Madras and Bengal and, few as they are, they have won battles against the great princes; and lastly, my mistress has told me that, although there are but few here, there are many at home; and they could, if they chose, send out twenty soldiers for every one there is here.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Besides, it is not these alone who fight. The natives enlist under them, and aid them in their conquests; and this shows, at least, that they are well treated, and have confidence in the good faith of the English."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is all very well, Soyera, to talk that way; but I would as willingly believe that the stars will fall from the sky as that these Englishmen, who simply live in Bombay because we suffer them to do so, should ever conquer the Mahrattas, as they have subdued other portions of India where, as everyone knows, the people are not warlike, and have always been conquered without difficulty.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Look at our power! At Delhi the emperor is a puppet in our hands, and it is the same in all the districts on the plain of the great river. The Rajpoots fear us, and even the Pindaries would not dare carry their raids into our country. That a small body of merchants and soldiers should threaten us seems, to me, altogether absurd."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, brother, we will not argue about it. Time will show. As a woman of the Mahrattas, I trust that day will never come; but as one who knows the English, I have my fears. Of one thing I am sure, that were they masters here, the cultivators would be vastly better off than they are at present."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Ramdass laughed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What do you think of my sister's opinions, Anundee?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I do not know what to think," the young woman said; "but Soyera has seen much, and is a wise woman, and what she says are no idle words. To us it seems impossible, when we know that the Mahrattas can place a hundred thousand horsemen in the field; but I own that, from what we know of the English, it might be better for people like us to have such masters."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And now, Soyera," Ramdass said, when he returned from his work in the evening, "tell us more about yourself. First, how did you learn where I was living?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I learned it from the wife of our cousin Sufder."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How did you fall in with him?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, I must tell you something. I had meant to keep it entirely to myself, but I know that you and Anundee will keep my secret."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Assuredly we will. I am not a man to talk of other people's affairs and, as to Anundee, you can trust her with your life."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, in the first place, I deceived you; or rather you deceived yourself, when you said, 'I see that you have been married;' but the children were here, and so I could not explain. The infant is not mine. It is the son of my dear master and mistress, both of whom were killed, three days ago, by bands--of which Sufder commanded one--who attacked them suddenly, by night."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What! Is the child white?" Ramdass asked, in a tone of alarm.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is not white, because I have stained the skin; but it is the child of English parents. I will tell you how it happened."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And she related the instances of the attack upon the little camp, the death of her master and mistress, another white officer, and all their escort; told how she had hidden the child under the cover of the tent, how Sufder had saved her life, and her subsequent conversation with him regarding the child.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Now, what do you intend to do with him, Soyera?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I intend to bring him up as my own. I shall keep his skin stained, and no one can suspect that he is not mine."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then you do not think of restoring him to his people?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Not until he grows up. He has neither father nor mother, and to whom could I hand him, now? Moreover if, as you say, our people intend to drive the English from Bombay, his fate would be certain. When I am by myself with him, I shall talk to him in English, as soon as he is old enough to understand that he must not speak in that language to others; then, when he joins his own people, he will be able to converse with them. In the ten years I have spent in English service I have come to speak their language well. Though I cannot teach him the knowledge of the English, I can do much to fit him to take his place as an Englishman, when the time comes."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is a risky business," her brother said, "but I do not say that it cannot be carried out; at any rate, since you have so decided to keep him, I can see no better plan."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Two days later, Sufder came in.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "So you got here safely, Soyera?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, I had no trouble. But I did not expect you back so soon."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The matter is all settled, though I think we were wrong to grant any terms to the English. We had them in our power, and should have finished the matter, straight off."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Delay and inactivity, the natural consequences of utter incompetence and of divided councillors, had occurred. Colonel Egerton, in consequence of sickness, had resigned the command; and had been succeeded by Lieutenant Colonel Cockburn. On the 9th of January they were within eighteen miles of Poona, and they had still three weeks' provisions with them. Two or three skirmishes had taken place, but without any result; yet Mr. Carnac, without having suffered any reverse, and now within a day's march of the capital, proposed that a retreat should be made, at once.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The proposal was combated by Captain Hartley, a gallant young officer, and Mr. Holmes of the Civil Service. Cockburn, being called upon for his opinion, said he had no doubt the army could penetrate to Poona; but that it would be impossible for it to protect its enormous baggage train. Mr. Carnac, however, persisted in his opinion, in spite of the prayers of Rugoba and, at eleven o'clock on the night of the 11th of January, the heavy guns were thrown into a large pool, a quantity of stores burnt, and the force began its retreat, in face of enemies estimated differently at from fifty to a hundred thousand men.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Against such vigilant foes there was but little hope, indeed, that the movement would be unnoticed and, at two o'clock in the morning, a party of horse attacked the advance guard. Cockburn sent forward two companies of Europeans to support them, but the Mahrattas had succeeded in plundering part of the baggage.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In a very short time the rear was also attacked. This was covered by some six companies of Sepoys, with two guns, commanded by Captain Hartley. These received the charge of the enemy's horse and foot with great steadiness and, several times, took the offensive and drove their assailants back.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When morning broke, the little force found themselves altogether surrounded by the whole army of the Mahrattas. Hartley's Sepoys were now sorely pressed, but still maintained their position, and were reinforced by five companies of Europeans and two more companies of Sepoys. With this support, Hartley beat off every attack. At ten o'clock he received orders from Colonel Cockburn to retreat, but the officer who carried the message returned, begging that he would allow Captain Hartley to await a more favourable opportunity. Cockburn agreed to this, but sent Major Frederick to take command of the rear, with orders to retire on the main body. This movement he effected without serious loss, and joined the rest of the force at the village of Wurgaom.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 It was already crowded with camp followers, and the wildest confusion reigned. The enemy's horse took advantage of this and charged through the baggage, and the troops were unable to act with effect, being mixed up with the crowd of fugitives. However, they soon extricated themselves, drove off the enemy, and placed the guns in commanding positions round the village. At four o'clock the enemy retired.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Early the next morning the Mahratta artillery opened fire on the village. Some of the Sepoy troops now became dispirited; but Hartley's men stood firm, and the Mahrattas did not venture to attack. The loss on the previous day was found to amount to three hundred and fifty-two killed, wounded, or missing; including many who had deserted during the night. Among the killed and wounded were fifteen European officers, whose loss was a great misfortune for, although the Sepoys fight well under their European officers, they lose heart altogether if not so led.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Mr. Palmer, the secretary of the committee, was now sent to negotiate with the enemy. The first demand made was the surrender of Rugoba; which the committee would have agreed to, but Rugoba had privately arranged to surrender to Scindia. The next demand was that the committee should enter on a treaty, for the surrender of the greater part of the territory of the Bombay Government, together with the revenue of Broach and Surat. These terms were so hard that even the craven committee, who were entirely responsible for the disaster, hesitated to accept them.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Cockburn was asked whether a retreat was wholly impracticable, and he declared that it was so. Captain Hartley protested against this opinion, and showed how a retreat could be managed. His opinion was altogether overruled, and Mr. Holmes was sent with powers to conclude the treaty--which, however, the committee never intended to observe.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Scindia took the principal part in arranging the details, superseding the authority of Nana Furnuwees, the Peishwa's minister. Scindia's favour was purchased by a private promise to bestow upon him the English share of Broach, besides a sum of forty-one thousand rupees as presents to his servants.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 For their share in this miserable business Mr. Carnac, Colonel Egerton, and Colonel Cockburn were dismissed from the Company's service; and Captain Hartley was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. The Governor of Bombay refused to ratify the treaty, on the ground that the officials with the expedition had no power whatever to enter into any arrangement, without the matter being previously submitted to, and approved by, the Government. Fortunately, at this moment a force that had been despatched from Bengal, under Colonel Goddard, to support Rugoba was nearing the scene of action; and that officer, learning the danger to which Bombay was exposed, took the responsibility and, marching from Hoosingabad, avoided a body of twenty-two thousand horse, which had been despatched from Poona to cut him off, and reached Surat without encountering any opposition.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 This welcome reinforcement materially altered the situation, and Bombay lay no longer at the mercy of the Mahrattas. There was now Goddard's force, and the army that had fallen back from Poona and, what was still more important, Scindia had by his secret convention deserted the confederacy; and it was morally certain that neither the Peishwa nor Holkar would send his forces against Bombay, leaving to Scindia the power of grasping the supreme authority in the Deccan during their absence.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In 1779 General Goddard, who was now in command at Bombay, entered into negotiations with Nana Furnuwees. These were carried on for some months; but were brought to a conclusion by Nana declaring that the surrender of Salsette, and the person of Rugoba, who was again a fugitive in Bombay, were preliminaries to any treaty. Bombay received a reinforcement of a European regiment, a battalion of Sepoys, and a hundred artillerymen, from Madras; but before they arrived Goddard's force had captured Dubhoy, and a treaty had been effected.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The town of Ahmedabad was to be handed over to our ally, Futteh Sing; but it declined to surrender, and was taken by assault, the storming party being commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Hartley.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Scindia had as usual changed sides, and was now operating in conjunction with Nana; and he and Holkar, with twenty thousand horse, marched to Baroda. Goddard advanced to give battle; but Scindia, to gain time, opened negotiations.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Goddard, however, was not to be duped. The negotiations were broken off, and he advanced against the Mahrattas. Their horse, as usual, charged; but were driven back by the artillery fire, and routed by a regiment of Bengal cavalry. Scindia, however, encamped a short distance off but, when Goddard again advanced to the attack, retired.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Goddard, however, was not to be drawn into pursuit. He captured some small forts, and sent Colonel Hartley to relieve Kallan, which was being besieged by the Mahrattas. Hartley surprised their camp, pursued them for some miles, and killed a great number; while Lieutenant Welsh, who had been sent forward to relieve Surat--which was threatened by a large Mahratta force--defeated these, killed upwards of a hundred, and captured their guns; while one of Scindia's detachments, on the banks of the Nerbuddah, was routed by a detachment of Bengal Sepoys under Major Forbes.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 On the other side of India, great successes had been gained by a Bengal force under the command of Captain Popham; who attacked and routed a body of plundering Mahrattas, captured by assault the strong fort of Lahar, and not only carried by surprise the fortress of Gwalior, regarded by the natives as impregnable, but took it without the loss of a single man.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In December, General Goddard laid siege to Bassein. He and Hartley, whose force was covering the siege, were attacked on the 11th of that month by twenty thousand cavalry and infantry. These, however, were defeated after making several desperate charges; and on the following day another battle took place, in which the Mahrattas were totally routed, and their general killed, after which Bassein surrendered.
