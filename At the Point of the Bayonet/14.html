The chatter of many voices showed that a portion, at any rate, of the assailants were beyond the stockade; but it was not until nine o'clock that numerous parties were seen coming from the forest. 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I suppose they have been making ladders all night," Harry said to Abdool, who was with him on the wall; from which, owing to the fact that the house stood on a rising knoll of ground, which commanded a good view over the stockade, the assailants could be seen.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, I have no doubt we shall be able to beat them off. We have as many men as we want for the circuit of the walls and, while we shall be partly sheltered, they will have to advance in the open."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The Malays had, indeed, been busy since daybreak in manufacturing arrows from thin reeds and bamboos, used in the construction of the huts demolished on the previous evening; tipping them with chips of stone and winging them with feathers, of which plenty were found in the houses and scattered about the yard. All felt that this would be the decisive attack; and that the enemy, after one more repulse, would draw off. That the repulse would be given, all felt confident. Already the slaughter of their assailants had been very great, while very few of their own number had fallen.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 An hour later, large parties of the enemy advanced to the stockade. This they did unmolested, as the distance was too great for anything like certainty of aim. The rajah again took his place by Harry's side. Presently, at the sound of a horn, a great flight of arrows rose high in the air from behind the stockade.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "They are fire arrows!" the rajah exclaimed. "I will send a hundred men down, to help the women to extinguish them;" and he himself descended, an officer following, with the men.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The women were all seated close to the platforms and, as the arrows came raining down, they ran out; being joined by the rajah and his men. Had the leafy roofs remained in their place, the whole would have been in a blaze in two or three minutes. As it was, the vast proportion of the arrows stuck in the earth, and burnt themselves out; while the few that fell among the debris that had not been cleared away were extinguished, immediately. For two or three minutes the showers of arrows continued; and then ceased as, to the surprise of the assailants, there were no indications of the palace being on fire.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Then the signal was given for the attack and, exasperated by the failure of the plan they had relied upon as being certain to cause a panic, the Malays, with loud shouts, rushed forward. A large number of them carried ladders and, in spite of the many who fell under the arrows of the defenders, the ladders were soon planted against the walls; and the Malays swarmed up on all sides.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A desperate struggle took place. Some of the ladders were high enough to project above the wall. These, with the men upon them, were thrown back. On others the Malays, as they climbed up, were met by the spears of the defenders or, as their heads rose above the walls, with the deadly kris. Their leaders moved about among the throng below, urging the men forward; and Harry, seeing that things were going on well, all round, took the guns from the hands of the soldier who attended him, and directed his aim against these.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Three fell to his first shots. As the soldier handed them to him, reloaded, his eye caught a group of chiefs, behind whom stood what was evidently a picked body of men. In the midst of the group was the rajah to whom Harry had recently been a prisoner. With a feeling of deep satisfaction, that his hand should avenge the murder of his four troopers, Harry levelled his gun between two of the defenders of the wall, took a steady aim, and fired.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;Illustration: Without a cry, the rajah fell back, shot through the head.
</div> 
<div>
 As the chief was but some twenty-five yards away, there was little fear of his missing and, without a cry, the rajah fell back, shot through the head. A yell of consternation rose from those around him. Two more shots then rang out, and two more chiefs fell.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The others shouted to their men, and a furious rush forward was made. Harry snatched up a spear, lying by the side of a native who had fallen; shouted to the rajah's guard of twenty men--who were in the yard below, as a reserve in case the enemy gained a footing at any point of the wall--to come up, and then joined in the fight.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The assailants fought with such fury that, for a time, the issue was doubtful. Several times, three or four succeeded in throwing themselves over the wall; but only to be cut down, before they could be joined by others. At last the Malays drew off, amid the exultant shouts of the defenders.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In a short time, the attack became more feeble at all points. The news of the death of their leader had doubtless spread, and its effect was aided by several other chiefs falling under Harry's fire and, ere long, not one of their followers remained inside the palisade. Half an hour later, the lookout from the top of the rajah's house shouted that the whole of the assailants were retiring, in a body, towards the forest.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Excited by their victory, the rajah's troops would have sallied out in pursuit; but Harry dissuaded him from permitting it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "They must have lost, altogether, over a thousand of their men; but they are still vastly more numerous than your people, and nothing would suit them better than that you should follow them, and give them a chance of avenging the loss they have suffered."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But the rajah will come again. He will never remain quiet, under the disgrace."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He will trouble you no more," Harry said. "I shot him myself, and six or seven of his principal chiefs."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You are indeed my friend!" the rajah exclaimed, earnestly, when the words were translated to him. "Then there is a hope that I may have peace. The death of the rajah, and of so many of the chiefs that have joined him, will lead to quarrels and disputes; and the confederacy formed against me will break up and, while fighting among themselves, they will not think of attacking, again, a place that has proved so fatal to them."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The rajah had some difficulty in allaying the enthusiasm of his men; but he repeated what Harry had said to him, and added that, since it was entirely due to their white guest that they had repulsed the attack, there could be no doubt that his advice must now be attended to, since he had shown himself a master in war.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Be content," he said. "Wherever our language is spoken, the Malays will tell the story of how three thousand men were defeated by five hundred; and it will be said that the men of Johore surpassed, in bravery, everything that has been told of the deeds of their fathers. There is no fear of the enemy returning here. The rajah and many of his chiefs have fallen, by the hand of our white friend. Henceforth, for many years, you will be able to rest in peace.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "In a month you will have rebuilt the houses, and sown again the fields that have been burnt. After that, we shall have leisure, and a treble stockade shall be built, stronger and firmer than that into which they forced an entry. Your first task must be to carry the bodies of our enemies far out beyond the town, where their skeletons will act as a warning as to what welcome Johore gives to its foes. A present of money will be given to each man, this afternoon, to help him to rebuild his house, and make good the damages that he has suffered."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The interpreter had rapidly translated the speech to Harry as it went on and, as the rajah ended, and the applause that greeted him subsided, Harry said a few words to the interpreter, which he repeated to the rajah. The latter held up his hand, to show that he had more to say.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "My white friend warns me that, for a day or two, we must not leave the town. It may be that the enemy have halted near the edge of the forest, in the hope of taking us unawares. This, however, can only be for a day or two, at most; for I have no doubt that the provisions they brought with them are, by now, exhausted and, if they stop in the forest, they will perish from hunger; therefore let no one go beyond the town, for two days. A watch shall be kept on the roof of my house and, if any of the enemy make their appearance in the forest, a horn will summon all to retire within the walls."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 There was feasting that night at the rajah's house. All his officers and men of importance were present. Sacks of rice and other grain were distributed among the soldiers and women; some buffaloes that had been driven inside the wall to serve as food, should the siege prove a long one, were also killed and cut up; and very large jars, containing the fermented juice of the pineapple, and other fruits, were served out.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 During the day the breaches in the palisades had all been repaired and, at night, the whole population were told to remain within its shelter, while numerous guards were posted by the rajah. While the meal at the rajah's was going on, a party of native musicians played and sang, the Malays being very fond of music.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry sat at the rajah's right hand, and was the subject of unbounded praise and admiration among the company. Speaker after speaker rose and addressed him and, afterwards, the interpreter said a few words to them in his name, thanking them for the goodwill they had shown, and praising them highly, not only for their bravery, but especially for the manner in which they had carried out the orders given to them. The proceedings did not terminate until a very late hour, and Harry was heartily glad when at last he could retire to rest.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In the morning, the rajah said to him:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Now, my friend, you have not told me why you have come here. We have been so busy that we have not spoken on other subjects, save the war. The message you sent up to me was that you came from the great white lord of Calcutta, and desired to see me. You may be sure that whatever you desire of me shall be granted for, were it not for your coming, I should now be a hunted fugitive, and my people slain."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is not much that I desire, Rajah. The tumangong is willing to grant to us a trading station, on the island of Singapore and, possibly, we may acquire from him the whole island; but we are aware that he is not the rightful lord of the island, and it may be that, in time, you may recover possession of all Johore. Thus, then, I come to you to ask you if you are willing to consent to this privilege being granted to us; which assuredly will benefit your kingdom by providing a market, close to you, at which you can barter your produce for goods that you require, with us or with native traders from the east. At present, we are not in a position to plant this trading station in Singapore, being engaged in serious wars in India; and it may be a considerable time before things have so settled down that we can do so. I have, therefore, only to ask your assent to our arrangement with the tumangong, whenever it can be carried out; and we shall certainly be willing to recognize your authority, by a gift of money."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I willingly consent," the rajah said; "it is, indeed, but a small thing. So long as I live, I shall be ready to enter into any treaty with you; and doubtless my successor, whoever he may be, knowing what you have done for us and our state, will also agree."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 [It was not, indeed, until the year 1819 that the British took possession of the island, paying sixty thousand dollars to the tumangong. Shortly after they had settled there the young prince, who had escaped from Johore, came down there. He was awarded a pension and, at the death of the rajah, was placed on the throne by the British, to the general satisfaction of the inhabitants.]
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The next day, a number of men came in from villages scattered among the hills, who had not heard of the approach of the enemy until too late to enter the town, and take part in its defence. By this time, scouts had penetrated far into the forest, and brought back news that, although there were many dead there, there were no signs of the enemy. The work, therefore, of rebuilding the town was commenced; every available man of the garrison, and those who had come in, being engaged in cutting wood and bringing it in.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In the course of the next day or two several chiefs, whose attitude had before been threatening, came or sent members of their families to congratulate the rajah upon the defeat that he had inflicted upon his enemies, and to assure him of their loyalty to his rule.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry had stayed on, at the earnest request of the rajah; but he now declared that he must return to the coast. The rajah's approval of the cession of a trading port, and of the island itself, was written both in the Malay and the English languages, and signed by the chief. Copies were also made and signed, by Harry, to be kept in the palace, in order that on any future occasion they could be consulted.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A great number of presents, of krises and other articles of Malayan manufacture, were offered to Harry; but he excused himself from accepting them, saying that, in the first place, it was not customary for commissioners of the Governor to accept presents; and in the second that, being constantly employed on service, he had no place where these could be deposited, during his long absences.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 On the third morning after the retreat of the enemy Harry started, with his two companions, for the coast; attended by an escort of twenty men of the rajah's own guard, commanded by a high officer. There was now no fear of molestation, but the escort was sent as a mark of honour. Starting early, they reached the coast town in the afternoon.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They were received with great joy by the inhabitants, who had been in a state of abject terror. A runner, who was the bearer of a message to the rajah from the headman, had left on the morning after Harry's party had started; and had returned with the news that he had found the headless bodies of all the escort, but had seen no traces of the white man nor his followers, who had doubtless all been carried off by the enemy. The news caused terrible consternation, as it was thought that the town might be attacked, at any moment. Those of the inhabitants who possessed canoes, took to them and paddled away down the coast. The others fled to the mountains.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Finding, however, from scouts who had been left, that four days had passed without the appearance of the enemy, most of them had returned, on the evening before Harry arrived there. On hearing, from his escort, of the defeat of the invaders and their enormous loss, the most lively joy was manifested; and Harry was treated with almost reverential respect, the men of the escort agreeing that it was solely due to him that the victory had been gained. He made, however, but a very short stay in the village; and the headman at once ordered the largest canoe to be prepared. This was decorated with flowers and flags and manned by twenty rowers who, as soon as Harry and his two companions took their seats in it, rowed off to the brig.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Welcome back, Lindsay!" Fairclough shouted, as the canoe approached; "we could hardly believe our eyes, when we saw you come down to the canoe. We have been in a terrible fright about you. The natives brought off news that the escort that had been sent down to take you to Johore were, every one, killed; and that, as there were no signs of any of your party, it was certain that you had been carried off. We sent a boat ashore, every morning, armed to the teeth; but they reported that the place was almost entirely deserted, and the two or three men left there said that no news, whatever, had been received of you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 By this time, Harry had gained the deck.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Where is your escort?" Fairclough asked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am sorry to say that they were all murdered. However, my story is a long one and, although the rajah sent down some food with the escort he gave me, I am desperately thirsty, and will tell you all that happened when I have wetted my whistle."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Fairclough told Hardy to come with them below, and Harry's story was told in full, over sundry cups of tea, which Harry preferred to stronger beverages.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That was an adventure, indeed," Fairclough said, when Harry had brought his story to an end. "I would have given anything to have been with you in that siege. I own I should not have cared about being a prisoner in that fellow's camp, especially as you were disarmed, and could not even make a fight for it. That affair with the leopard would have been more to my taste; though, if I had been in your place, with nothing but your knife and Abdool's, I doubt whether I should have come out of it as well as you did; but the other business was splendid, and those Malays of the rajah's must have fought well, indeed, to beat off a force six times their own strength."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The great point is that I have obtained his ratification of the tumangong's grant, whenever it may be made."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That is satisfactory, of course; but it would not have, to my mind, anything like the importance of your series of adventures, which will be something to think over all your life. I wish I had been there, with my crew, to have backed you up; though I am afraid that most of them would have shared the fate of your Malay escort, in that sudden attack in the forest."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes; with all their pluck, they could scarcely have repulsed such a sudden onslaught though, certainly, the killing would not all have been on one side. I am glad, indeed, that Abdool also came safely out of it; as I should have missed him, fearfully.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The interpreter showed himself a good man, and I hope that Lord Mornington will, when I report his conduct, make him a handsome present. If he had not got away with me, it is hardly likely I should ever have found my way to Johore and, if I had done so, I could not have explained to the rajah that he was going to be attacked, or have got him to erect the stockade that was the main cause of our success. In fact, he would probably, in his anger at the slaughter of his escort, have ordered me to be executed on the spot. As it was, he did not take either that, or the loss of his presents, greatly to heart."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You saved his kingdom for him, there is no doubt. It is not likely that he would ever have ventured to defend himself, had it not been for the confidence that he felt in you, and in the steps you took."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No; he told me, himself, that he would have taken flight at once and, in that case, his kingdom would have been lost; and he himself, sooner or later, hunted down."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And now, I suppose we can start as soon as we like?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Certainly; the sooner the better. I shall be very glad to be back again, for there is no saying what is going on there. Assuredly, the friendship of the Mahrattas cannot be relied upon. I know that we are not likely to make any fresh move, except in self defence, until Mysore is completely pacified, and a firm government established. Still, there is never any saying what will happen. Having been in the thick of the Mahratta business, all along, I should not like to be out of it, now."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, we will get up anchor at daybreak, tomorrow."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 All on board were glad, when the news that they were to sail for Calcutta, the next morning, was circulated through the ship. To the crew, the voyage had been a monotonous one; the weather having been uniformly fine, since they started; and they had had no adventures, such as they had hoped for, with hostile natives.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Nothing was talked of that night, between decks, but Harry's story; which had been told by Lieutenant Hardy to the midshipmen, who had retailed it to the petty officers, and it had rapidly spread. Abdool and the interpreter were made as much of as was possible, considering that neither could understand English; and deep were the expressions of regret that none of the sailors had taken part in so tough a fight.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 By the time the sun was up, next morning, the vessel was under weigh and, with light breezes, sailed round Singapore, and then headed northwest. The winds, as before, were light and, as the northeast monsoon was still blowing, the rate of progress was slow.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I wish we could have got into the Hooghly," Fairclough said, as he walked impatiently up and down the quarterdeck, "before the monsoon broke; but I don't see much chance of it. It generally changes about the middle of April, and we are well on in the first week, now. At the rate at which we are sailing, we shall take at least three weeks before we get there. You see, we are only just clear of the northern point of Sumatra; and it is already a month since we got up anchor."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But we shall have the wind almost behind us, Fairclough."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, when it has settled down. It is the change that I do not like. Of course, sometimes we have only a few days of moderately rough weather; but occasionally there is a hurricane at the break up, and a hurricane in the bay of Bengal is no joke. I shall not mind, much, if we get fairly past the Andamans; for from there to the mouth of the Hooghly it is open water, and I should be under no uneasiness as to the brig battling her way through it; but to be caught in a hurricane, with these patches of islands and rocks in the neighbourhood would, to say the least, be awkward."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Are there any ports among the islands? I recollect hearing an officer say that there was a settlement made there, some years ago."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That was so. In 1791 an establishment was started in the southern part of the island and, two years later, it was moved to a harbour on the northwest side of the bay. It was called Port Cornwallis; but was abandoned in 1796, being found terribly unhealthy. It was a pity, for it afforded good shelter when the northeast monsoon was blowing, and partially so from the southwest monsoon. No doubt it could have been made more healthy, if the country round had been well cleared; but it was not found to be of sufficient utility to warrant a large outlay, and the natives are so bitterly unfriendly that it would require a garrison of two or three hundred men to overawe them. We should have been always losing life--not from open attacks, perhaps, but from their habit of crawling up, and shooting men down with their arrows."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A week later, they were some seventy or eighty miles to the west of the Andaman group. Directly the brig weathered the northernmost point of Sumatra, the course had been laid more to the west, so as to avoid the dangerous inside passage. When Harry went on deck, in the morning, he found that the wind had dropped altogether.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "There is an end of the monsoon," Fairclough said. "I am just going to shorten sail. There is no saying which way the wind will come. The glass is falling fast but, of course, that is only to be expected. I think, if you are wise, after breakfast you will take off that drill suit, and get into something better calculated to stand rough weather; for that we are sure to have, and any amount of rain. That is always the case, at the changes of the monsoon.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;

 "You see, it is a sort of battle between the two winds; the southwesterly will gain, in the end, but the other will die hard; and it is this struggle that causes the circular storms which, when they are serious, are called hurricanes, though at ordinary times they are simply called the break up of the monsoon, which generally causes bad weather all over the Indian Ocean."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Towards evening, low banks of cloud were seen to the south, and the sky looked dim and misty in the opposite direction.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "They are mustering their forces, you see, Lindsay; and the glass has fallen so far that I fancy the fight will be a hot one. At any rate, we will make all snug for the night."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Sail after sail was taken in, until only a storm jib, a small fore stay-sail, and a close-reefed main top-sail were left standing. The bank of cloud to the south had risen considerably and, when darkness closed in, the upper edge was lit up by the almost incessant flicker of lightning. The upper spars were sent down on deck and then, there being nothing more to be done, the crew, who had all donned rough-weather clothes, awaited the outburst.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 That it would be more than ordinarily severe there could be no doubt, and the men, clustered in little groups by the bulwarks, talked in low tones as they watched the slowly-approaching storm from the south; with occasional glances northwards, where indeed no clouds could be seen, but the sky was frequently lit up by the reflections of lightning below the horizon.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What do you think of it?" Harry asked the interpreter.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I do not like it," the Malay replied. "I think that there will be a great hurricane. I have seen many changes of the monsoon, but never one that looked so threatening as this."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It does look bad," Harry said, "though, as I have never been at sea before, at the change of the monsoon, I am no judge at all; but it certainly looks as if we were in for a bad gale. At any rate, we shall be safer, here, than we were in that hut in the mountains."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The Malay made no reply, for some time. Then he said:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, sahib, but there was something to do, there. Directly we got in, you began to prepare for an escape. It was not certain that we should succeed. They might have come in and killed us, before you were ready but, as we were busy, we had not much time to think of the danger.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Here we can do nothing."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No. But, as you see, everything has already been done. You and I have not been working, but the sailors have been busy in taking off sail, and getting down all the upper spars. We are ready for the worst, now; just as we were when we had opened the passage for our escape, and we felt fairly confident--although we might meet with many dangers, we had a good chance of getting safely away."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "There are the danger signals, Lindsay," the captain said, as a pale light suddenly shone out above.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Looking up, Harry saw a ball of fire on the main-mast head. Presently, this seemed to roll down the mast, till it reached the top-sail yard; then it broke into two, and these rolled out until they remained stationary, one at each end of the yard. Harry had never seen this phenomenon before.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What is it?" he asked Fairclough, in an awed voice.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "They are often seen, before the outburst of a severe tempest. Of course, they look like balls of phosphorus; but in reality they are electric, and are a sign that the whole atmosphere is charged with electricity. Sailors have all sorts of superstitions about them but, of course, excepting that they are signs of the condition of the air, they are perfectly harmless."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He raised his voice.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Don't stand near the foot of the masts, lads; keep well away from them. There is nothing to be afraid of, in those lights; but if we happened to be struck by lightning and it ran down the mast, some of you might be knocked over.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I don't know why," he continued, to Harry, "the first flash of lightning at the beginning of a storm is always the most dangerous. I can't account for it, in any way, but there is no question as to the fact. I always feel relieved when the first clap of thunder is over; for I know, then, that we are comparatively safe from danger, in that way."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Gradually the stars disappeared.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Mr. Hardy," the captain said to the lieutenant, who was standing near, "will you go down to my cabin, and see how the glass stands?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry did not hear the answer, when Hardy returned, but Fairclough said to him:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It has gone down another quarter of an inch since I looked at it, half an hour ago; and it was as low, then, as I have ever seen it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Mr. Hardy, you had better send the men aloft, and furl the main top-sail, altogether; and run down the fore stay-sail. We can get it up again, as soon as the first burst is over. Put four men at the wheel."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 There was still no breath of wind stirring. The stay sail was run down, but the men hung back from ascending the shrouds of the main mast.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "They are afraid of those lights," Fairclough said, "but I do not think there is the slightest danger from them."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I will go up, myself, sir," Hardy said; and he ran up the starboard shrouds while, at the same moment, one of the midshipmen led the way on the port side. The sailors at once followed their officers.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The latter had nearly reached the yard, when the two balls of fire began to roll along it, joined in the centre, and then slowly ascended the topmast. The fireballs paused there for half a minute, and then vanished.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Now, Eden," the lieutenant said, "let us get the work done, at once, before that fellow makes his appearance again."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The men followed them out on the yard, and worked in desperate haste, with occasional glances up at the mast head. In a couple of minutes the sail was firmly secured in its gaskets, and all made their way below.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Thank goodness, here it comes, at last," Fairclough said; "the suspense is more trying than the gale itself."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A low murmur was heard, and a faint pale light was soon visible to the south.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Get ready to hold on, all!" he shouted to the men.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The sound momentarily increased in volume, and the distant light brightened until a long line of white foam was clearly discernible. It approached with extraordinary speed. There was a sudden puff of air. It lasted but a few seconds, and then died away.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Hold on!" the captain again shouted.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Half a minute later, with a tremendous roar, the wind struck the brig. Knowing which way it would come, Fairclough had, half an hour before, lowered a boat and brought the vessel's head round, so that it pointed north. The boat had then been hoisted up.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In the interval of waiting, the ship's head had slightly drifted round, again, and the wind struck her on the quarter. So great was the pressure that she heeled far over, burying her bows so deeply that it seemed as if she were going to dive, head foremost. The water swept over the bulwarks in torrents, and extended almost up to the foot of the foremast. Then, very slowly, as she gathered way, the bow lifted and, in a minute, she was scudding fast before the gale; gathering speed, every moment, from the pressure of the wind upon her masts and hull, and from the fragment of sail shown forward. At present there were no waves, the surface of the water seeming pressed almost flat by the weight of the wind.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Then there was a deafening crash, and a blaze of light. The fore-top mast was riven in fragments, but none of these fell on the deck, the wind carrying them far ahead.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You had better make your way forward, Mr. Hardy," Fairclough shouted, into the lieutenant's ear, "and see if anyone is hurt."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Fortunately the precaution which had been taken, of ordering the men away from the mast, had prevented any loss of life; but several of the men were temporarily blinded. Three or four had been struck to the deck, by the passage of the electric fluid close to them; but these presently regained their feet. Hardy returned, and reported to the captain.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You had better send the carpenter down, to see that there is no fire below."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In a minute the man ran up, with the news that he believed the foot of the mast was on fire. Mr. Hardy went to a group of men.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Get some buckets, my lads," he said quietly, "and make your way down to the hold. I will go with you. As was to be expected, the lightning has fired the foot of the mast; but there is no cause for alarm. As we have discovered it so soon, we shall not be long in getting it under."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The men at once filled the fire buckets and, led by Mr. Hardy, went below. As soon as the hatchway leading to the hold was lifted, a volume of smoke poured up.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Wait a minute, till it has cleared off a little," the lieutenant said; and then, to the midshipman who had accompanied him:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Go to the captain, and tell him that there is more smoke than I like, and ask him to come below. Tell him I think the pumps had better be rigged, and the hose passed down."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Fairclough, who was accompanied by Harry, joined him just as he was about to descend the ladder.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I will go down with you, Mr. Hardy," he said.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Mr. Eden, will you go up and send down all hands, except those at the wheel? Set a strong gang to rig the pumps, and pass the hose down."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He and the lieutenant then made their way along the hold. The smoke was very thick, and it was only by stooping low that they could get along. They could see, however, a glow of light ahead.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We can do nothing with this," the captain said, "beyond trying to keep it from spreading, until we have shifted all these stores. The gang with buckets had better come down, empty them on the pile, and then set to work to clear the stuff away, as quickly as possible."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The men, who came along gradually and with difficulty, began to remove the barrels, coils of rope, and spare sails stowed there. Several of them were overpowered by the smoke, and had to be carried up again; and others came down and took their places.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In three or four minutes the hose was passed down, and the clank of the pumps could be heard. Mr. Hardy took the nozzle and while the men, now a strong party, worked at the stores, directed a stream of water upon the flames.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 For a time, the efforts seemed to make no impression, and the steam added to the difficulty of working. Another gang of men were set to work, forward of the mast and, after half an hour's labour, the stores were so far removed that the hose could be brought to play upon the burning mass at the foot of the mast.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The lieutenant had been relieved by Harry, and he by the two midshipmen, in succession. Changes were frequent and, in another quarter of an hour, it was evident that the flames were well under control. The men engaged below relieved those at the pumps and, in an hour from the first outbreak, all danger was over, though pumping was kept up for some time longer.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The captain made frequent visits to the deck. The vessel was still running before the wind, and the sea had got up. The motion of the ship was becoming more and more violent but, as there was nothing to be done, the men below were not disturbed at their work, and this was continued until smoke no longer ascended.
