<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have read your report, Captain Lindsay, and thoroughly concur with you that the very meritorious conduct of the soldier of the 3rd Bombay Cavalry, who has so long been attached to your service, should be rewarded. I cannot, of course, promote him in his own regiment. He will therefore appear in orders, tomorrow, as appointed havildar in the 5th Bengal Cavalry, which is at present under my command; with a statement that, having now completed ten years' service in the Bombay army, and having for six years of it been serving chiefly in this presidency, and having distinguished himself by his fidelity and courage, he has now been specially singled out for this promotion; and will be henceforth in charge of an escort of twenty men, of his new regiment, attached to the general's staff.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "As to yourself, sir, I have, in a despatch that will be sent off this evening, strongly recommended you to the Governor General for promotion to the rank of major. You were, I see by our army list, promoted to the rank of captain, seven years ago, before being sent to Calcutta; and, considering the distinguished and dangerous services that you have rendered, I wonder that you have not received another step. That is, however, accounted for by the fact that you have now, for some time, been away from Calcutta with General Wellesley and myself. I am sure that my recommendation will at once be complied with."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am very grateful for your kindness, sir."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You owe it to your own merits, and not to any kindness on my part," Lord Lake said. "You have an altogether exceptional record and, even in the comparatively short time that you have been with me, have performed most valuable services. Colonel Monson reports most highly of your conduct during his retreat; and the mission that you undertook, at my request, to Colonel Ochterlony was a most dangerous one and, in itself, sufficient to ensure your promotion. There are many zealous officers in the service; but few, indeed, so qualified, by their acquaintance with the native languages, as to undertake the missions with which you have been entrusted, and have so successfully carried out."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry took the despatches and at once mounted his horse; which Abdool had brought round, as soon as his master was summoned to the general's tent. After he had left the camp, he called Abdool up to his side. The latter was still in his native dress.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Abdool, I shall have to look out for another cook and body servant; unless, indeed, I have another trooper told off to me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Abdool looked at Harry in astonishment.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How is that, my lord? Are you dissatisfied with me?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry laughed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Not in any way, Abdool; upon the contrary. But your name will appear in orders, tomorrow, as promoted to the rank of havildar, in the 5th Bengal Cavalry, as a recognition of your faithful services.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is a great honour," Abdool said, "especially as I have not served as a soubahdar; but I would far rather stay with you. You have been a father to me, and I pray you to let me remain as I am."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You are to remain with me, Abdool. If you had had to leave me I should, myself, have told the general that I was sure you would rather not do so; and that, when you left me, I should myself show my gratitude for your good services; but of his own accord he has arranged this. You are not to join your new regiment, but are to command twenty sowars of the 5th, which are to be attached to those of the general's staff, for escort duty. In this way you will still be with me, but as a native officer instead of a servant; and should I be sent on any special duty you will, I am sure, be able to go with me, as before."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Abdool's face brightened.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That would be well, indeed, sahib. It will truly be a great honour to be an officer and, if I ever return to my native village in the Deccan, I shall be regarded with great respect, and the faces of my father and mother will be made white at the honour I have won. Still, I fear that I shall not be as much with you as I have been, before."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Nearly as much, Abdool. I expect that Lord Lake, knowing how much I am indebted to you, will permit me to take you with me, when engaged on any detached service; and you and your troopers will form part of his escort, at all times. Besides, it is likely that, as matters stand, I shall not be sent away on any special duty for some time to come. You will, I know, be glad to hear that the general has recommended me for promotion, also; and that I shall shortly be a major."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That pleases me more than my own promotion, sahib. I thought that you would have had it long ago, after that business at Nagpore."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I had only been a captain then a few months, and was very young for that rank. It would have been unfair to others if I had been promoted then. I am still very young to be a major."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is not years, but what you have done," Abdool said. "Did you not obtain the release of Nana Furnuwees, and so change the state of affairs, altogether, at Poona?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, it was for that I got the rank of captain and, since then, though I have made a few journeys that would have been perilous, had I not been able to speak Mahratti like a native, I have had no opportunities of specially distinguishing myself.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "As soon as we get to Delhi, you had better order yourself a uniform. You know the dress worn by the native officers of the 5th; and you must hurry the tailor on, for you may be sure that the army will not remain long at Delhi; but will set off to meet Holkar as soon as provisions are collected, for there is no saying how far we may have to march before we meet him. I do not think that he will be in any hurry to give battle."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 On the 18th of October, the army arrived before Delhi. Holkar's cavalry were still in the neighbourhood; but news came that the infantry, with a considerable number of his guns and a few thousand horsemen, had left him. On the 29th he crossed the Jumna, below Panniput, to attack a detachment of one battalion of Sepoys and some matchlock men who were, under Colonel Burns, returning to the station at Saharunpoor--from which he had hastened, when a report reached him that Holkar meditated an attack on Delhi. He was overtaken by Holkar at Shamlee.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The inhabitants of the place joined Holkar, but Burns formed his camp into a square, and repulsed all attacks; until General Lake, with six regiments of cavalry, the horse artillery, and a brigade of infantry, arrived to his relief on the 3rd of November; when Holkar at once retired, and marched south into the district known as the Doab, where his horsemen plundered and burnt every village near his line of route. General Lake followed at once.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He had, before leaving Delhi, sent the rest of the British infantry, with two regiments of cavalry, under General Fraser, to attack Holkar's infantry and artillery; which had retired into the dominions of the Rajah of Bhurtpoor who, although he had been the first to enter into alliance with the British, after the capture of Agra, had now declared against them. They had taken up a position near the rajah's fortress of Deeg, which was believed to be impregnable.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Their position was a very strong one. An extensive morass and a deep tank covered their front. On their left was a fortified village; and on their right the fort of Deeg, which was supported by several lines of batteries.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry had been directed to accompany General Fraser, and was to take with him Abdool's little troop, to serve as escort and furnish messengers. Abdool--now in his new uniform--rode at its head, behind General Fraser's staff, as he reconnoitred the enemy's position; and felt no small pride in his changed position, especially as the British officers of the staff, all of whom had heard of the manner in which he had brought about Harry's escape, took special notice of him; and on the march one or other had often dropped behind to have a talk with him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The next morning the British troops moved forward to the attack, in two lines. The 76th Regiment rushed impetuously against the fortified village, and drove its defenders out at the point of the bayonet. A tremendous fire was at once opened by the batteries behind it but, without for a moment hesitating, the 76th charged them, and were speedily in the thick of their enemies. The 1st Bengal European regiment, which followed, seeing them almost surrounded, ran down to their assistance; and were followed by the Sepoys; and Holkar's infantry, unable to resist the assault, fled to shelter of their next line of guns.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 General Fraser himself led the attack upon these. They were also carried; but the general fell, mortally wounded. Colonel Monson, who now succeeded to the command, reformed the troops--who were in some disorder, owing to the impetuosity of their charge--and led them forward again. Battery after battery was captured. Numbers of Holkar's men tried to cross the morass, but sank in the mud and lost their lives. The rest took refuge under the walls of Deeg, whose guns at once opened fire upon their pursuers.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 While the tide pressed forward, unchecked, the Mahratta horse had ridden down in the rear of the British; and had taken possession of the first line of batteries, and had turned their guns upon their late captors. The consequences would have been serious, had not Captain Norford gathered together twenty-eight men of the 76th Regiment, and led them against the Mahratta horse. These, staggered by the daring with which this handful of men advanced against them, fired a hasty volley and fled. Captain Norford was killed, but the men took possession of the guns; which the Mahrattas, thinking that the day was altogether lost, did not attempt to recapture.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As the fortress of Deeg was far too strong to be attacked by any force unprovided with siege guns, the British drew back, until beyond the range of its cannon; carrying off all the guns captured in the batteries, eighty-seven in number. The total amount of artillery employed against our troops was no less than one hundred and sixty guns. Our loss was naturally heavy, amounting to over six hundred and forty killed and wounded; while that of the enemy was estimated at two thousand killed, or smothered in the morass.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The force encamped beyond the reach of the guns of Deeg, awaiting orders from General Lake. The battle was scarcely over when Colonel Monson rode up to Harry, and said:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is of great importance that General Lake should receive the news of our victory, as soon as possible. There is no one so well fitted to carry it as you are. There will be no occasion for disguise, this time; for Holkar's depredations must have excited the whole population against him. At the same time, you had better take your havildar and his troopers with you. It will command respect and, if you should come across any small body of Holkar's marauders, I am sure that you will give a good account of them."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Can you give me any indication as to where General Lake is likely to be, at present, sir?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He marched from Shamsheer to Mahomedabad and, as he probably took the road through Sekerah, he no doubt settled accounts with that rascally rajah. I understood, from him, that he suspected Holkar would make for Sherdanah; as the Begum of that place has five battalions of drilled troops, and forty guns, which would be a welcome reinforcement. After that he will, of course, be guided by Holkar's movements.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The reports of the peasantry lead me to believe that the enemy are advancing in the direction of Furukabad. I should say that you had best cross the Jumna at Muttra, and ride to Alighur. In that way you will not be likely to meet Holkar's force; which must, at present, be beyond the Ganges."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Half an hour later, Harry started with his escort. He crossed the Jumna at Muttra, and there learned that Holkar had, the night before, arrived within twelve miles of the town; and was, as usual, destroying everything before him. Harry continued his course to Cod, within a mile or two of Alighur, which he reached late in the evening.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The capture of the fort, believed to be impregnable, had had the effect of producing so profound a respect for the British arms that Harry, on his arrival, was received by the principal men of the town; and a large house was placed at his disposal, for himself and his escort. Supplies were at once furnished and, when a meal had been eaten and the horses attended to, the troops lay down for the night.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry had been informed that a horseman had brought in news that the British army had arrived at Bareilly. He started at daybreak and, late the next evening, after a ride of over one hundred miles, rode into Lord Lake's camp.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What news do you bring?" the general asked, as he alighted from his horse.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have to report, sir, that on the 13th the force under General Fraser attacked the enemy, who were very strongly posted within gunshot of the fortress of Deeg. After hard fighting he completely defeated them, captured eighty-seven of their guns, and drove them from under the guns of Deeg, which at once opened fire on us. The enemy's loss was estimated at two thousand. Ours was not known, when I left the camp; but it was roughly estimated at over six hundred in killed and wounded. Among the former, I regret to say, was General Fraser, who was mortally wounded by a cannon shot, while leading on his men."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am sorry to hear of his loss," General Lake said, "while the rest of your news is satisfactory, indeed. Reports had reached me that the Rajah of Bhurtpoor had joined Holkar but, after coming into Agra and begging that we would accept him as an ally, I had difficulty in believing that he would have turned against us; especially as he must have known that, if Holkar was defeated, he would have to bear the whole brunt of our anger--which he could not hope to escape, as his territory lies within two or three days' march of Agra."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The general called his staff, and told them of the brilliant victory that had been won at Deeg. The news spread rapidly through the camp, and was greeted with enthusiastic cheers by the troops. In the meantime Lord Lake had entered his tent, and obtained full particulars of the battle.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I was close to General Fraser when he was struck, sir," Harry concluded. "He and his escort were with the cavalry, when it charged the second line of their batteries. Five of the escort were killed; and I may say that the others, led by their havildar, were among the first in at the guns."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have just received news," the general said, "that Holkar crossed this morning, at Surajepoor; and was believed to be on his way to Furukabad. He is evidently on the march to Deeg and, if he joins his troops there, they may attack Colonel Monson's force. Therefore I intend to leave the tents and infantry to follow; and shall start at daybreak, with the cavalry and horse artillery; and hope to overtake him, especially as he has lately moved fast, and will probably rest a day or two at Furukabad."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The next day the cavalry marched upwards of forty miles and, on the following morning, continued their journey. They had fifty-eight miles now before them. With occasional halts they marched all day, crossed the Ganges at Surajepoor, and pushed on until within a mile of Holkar's camp. Believing the British to be many miles away, no precautions had been taken against surprise; and the first intimation of an enemy being near at hand was the opening of fire, at daybreak, by Lord Lake's artillery into their camp--the guns being posted so as to permit the British cavalry to attack, without coming across the line of fire.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Round after round of grape was poured into the camp; and then the guns ceased firing, as the six regiments of cavalry dashed in among the panic-stricken enemy. Scarcely any resistance was attempted and, in a few minutes, the ground was strewn with dead. Holkar had mounted and ridden off, with a portion of his cavalry, before our men entered the camp; and did not draw rein until he reached Caline, eighteen miles distant. His troops fled in all directions, hotly pursued by the cavalry, for twelve miles; great numbers being overtaken and cut down. The cavalry halted from sheer fatigue, having performed the almost unparalleled march of seventy miles since their last halting place; an exploit rendered all the more wonderful by the fact that they had made a march of three hundred and fifty miles in the preceding fortnight.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Their loss, in the action, was only two killed and twenty wounded. Holkar's loss was estimated at three thousand killed on the field; and half of his cavalry, which was previously sixty thousand strong, were now but scattered fugitives.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 That day three royal salutes were fired, for as many victories; namely, that at Furukabad, that at Deeg, and the capture of Shaddone--the last of Holkar's fortresses in the south--by Colonel Wallis. As was expected, Holkar and his cavalry, as soon as they recovered from their panic, rode to Deeg and joined the remains of the infantry and artillery there.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 General Lake remained a day or two, to rest the troops after their exertions. The brigade of infantry that, had been left behind when the cavalry started on their last march, had been ordered to move rapidly down to Agra; and to escort thence the heavy guns that would be required for the siege of Deeg and, on the 1st of December, General Lake joined the force near that fortress. The battering train arrived from Agra on the 12th, and the trenches were opened on the following day.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In point of territory, the country ruled over by the Rajah of Bhurtpoor was a comparatively small one. It was inhabited by a people called Jats, who differed in many respects from the communities round them. They were hardy, industrious, and brave; and had, at one time, taken a prominent share in the wars of that part of India, and had been masters of Agra. They had lost the city, however, in 1774; and with it a considerable portion of their territory. Under the present rajah, however, they had regained some of their lost ground and, on his entering into an alliance with the British, he had received a considerable increase of territory.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In these circumstances the defection was wholly unexpected. The rajah had a standing army of six thousand men; and could, on an emergency, place fifty thousand in the field. Nevertheless, seeing how other very much more powerful native princes had been unable to withstand the British arms, his conduct was not only ungrateful and treacherous, but wholly unaccountable.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 It was necessary for the army to move forward to Deeg with great circumspection. Holkar's cavalry constantly hovered round them, and they had to protect an enormous train conveying the siege appliances and provisions for the force. In view of the comparatively small equipage now deemed sufficient, in native wars in India, the size of that which accompanied Lord Lake's army, on this occasion, appears prodigious. The followers were estimated at not less than sixty thousand. Besides elephants and camels, a hundred thousand bullocks were employed on preparations for an advance into the town.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But, during the night, Holkar and the garrison of Deeg retired, and made for Bhurtpoor. On the morning of the 25th, therefore, the British took unopposed possession of Deeg; capturing, there and in the batteries outside, a hundred guns. A week later, General Lake moved forward to Bhurtpoor. Holkar, as before, had not entered the town; but had formed a camp a few miles distant. Here he was able to maintain himself, for the Rajah of Bhurtpoor had called to his assistance a great marauding leader, Ameer Khan, who was raiding in Bundelcund; and also a leader named Bapeejee Scindia; and these, with the rajah's cavalry and that of Holkar, formed so powerful a force that the British cavalry were fully occupied in keeping them at a distance from camp, and in protecting the convoy.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 On the day of the arrival of the army before Bhurtpoor, Harry--who had now been gazetted to the rank of major--was sent to Agra, thirty-four miles distant, with orders respecting a convoy that was about to be sent off from there. He was accompanied by Abdool and ten troopers. At that time Ameer Khan had not appeared upon the scene, and it was not considered that there was any danger of the communications with Agra being interfered with.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry reached the city in the afternoon, and waited there until four o'clock next day; seeing that the preparations for the convoy, which was a very large one, were completed. It started at that hour, and was to get as far as possible by nightfall; so that it would be able to reach the camp by the following evening. After seeing it in motion, Harry started with his escort for the ride back. He was some ten miles away from the convoy when night fell. Bhurtpoor, like Deeg, stood on a plain, surrounded by swamps and morasses; the situation having been chosen from the difficulties these offered to the advance of an enemy.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 After proceeding for five miles farther, Abdool, who was riding with Harry, said:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I do not know, sahib, but it seems to me, by the sound of the horses' hoofs, that we have left the track."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry called a halt; and Abdool dismounted, and found that his suspicion was correct, and that they had certainly left the road.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "This is awkward," Harry said, "for we do not know how long it is since we left it, or whether it is to the right hand or left."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The night was indeed a very dark one, a mist almost covered the sky, and it was only occasionally that a star could be seen.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We must go carefully, or we shall fall in one of these morasses."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Two troopers were sent off, one to the right, the other to the left. One of them, when he had gone about a quarter of a mile, was heard to shout that he was fast in the morass. Abdool and four of the men rode to his assistance, and presently returned with him, having with the greatest difficulty extricated his horse. Nothing had been heard of the other trooper. Again and again Harry shouted, but no reply came back. They waited half an hour, and then concluded that either the man, on his return, had missed his way altogether; or that he had fallen into a swamp, when they were too far off to hear his voice, and had perished there.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry again gave the word for them to move on, this time at a walk. Abdool preceded them on foot. Presently he said:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The ground is getting softer, sahib. I think that we are approaching a swamp."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We had better all dismount," Harry said, setting the example.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Now, let each move in different directions, going very cautiously, and calling out if he comes upon soft ground."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He himself, with two of the troopers, remained with the horses. One after another, the men came upon swampy ground; one only continued to find it firm.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I suppose that that is the way we came into it, Abdool," Harry said, as the others returned to the horses. "We must follow him, and will do it on foot. This is getting serious."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 For a quarter of a mile, they kept on ground that was comparatively firm. Then the man ahead of them gave a sudden shout. He had fallen, waist deep, into a little stream. He was soon hauled out.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "There is nothing to be done, Abdool, but to halt till morning. Let us go back, till we can find a piece of ground dry enough to lie down upon."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They had made, however, little progress when their feet began to sink up to the ankles.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is no use, Abdool. We have evidently lost our bearings, altogether. We must stay where we are till morning, or we shall get helplessly bogged."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The hours passed slowly and painfully. From time to time, the men endeavoured to find firmer ground, but always without success; and it was with the deepest satisfaction that, at last, they saw the sky begin to lighten. Half an hour later, they were able to form an idea of their position.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They were far in what appeared to be a wide morass. There were pools of water in some places, and it seemed almost miraculous that they should have succeeded in so far entering the swamp where, even by daylight, there scarcely seemed a yard of firm ground. Abdool again went ahead and, step by step, the little troop followed; frequently having to turn back again, on finding the line that they were pursuing impassable.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They were still a hundred yards from what appeared to be solid ground when they heard loud shouts and, looking round, saw some fifty horsemen skirting the edge of the morass. When they reached the point opposite to the little party, they dismounted and opened fire. One of the troopers fell dead, and several of the horses were hit.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "There is nothing for it but to surrender, Abdool," Harry said, as some of the troopers returned the fire.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The enemy rode off for a hundred yards; and then, leaving the horses in charge of a few of their number, they returned to the edge of the morass, threw themselves down in the long coarse grass, and again opened fire. Two more of the troopers fell, at the first discharge. Harry drew out his handkerchief, and waved it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;Illustration: Harry drew out his handkerchief, and waved it.
</div> 
<div>
 "We will not surrender, if they are Holkar's men," he said to Abdool. "We should only be tortured, and then put to death. If they are Bhurtpoor's men, we may have fair treatment."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Therefore, as soon as the enemy had stopped firing he shouted:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Whose soldiers are you?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The Rajah of Bhurtpoor's," was shouted back.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We will surrender, if you will swear to take us to Bhurtpoor and hand us over to the rajah. If you will not do so, we will defend ourselves to the last."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A native officer stood up.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Assuredly we will take you to the rajah. I swear it on my faith."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Very well then, send a man to guide us out of this place."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 An order was given. One of the men went back and mounted his horse, and rode along by the edge of the morass for nearly half a mile. The others, more slowly, followed him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is clear that this place in front of us is absolutely impassable," Harry said, "or they would never all move away."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is lucky that you have not got your favourite horse today, sir," Abdool said--for Harry had bought, from one of the cavalry, a horse that had been captured from the Mahrattas, as one was insufficient for the work he had to do.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I should be very glad, indeed, Abdool, if I thought that I was likely to return to camp soon. But in such peril as this, it is but a small satisfaction to know that he is safe."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What do you think of our chances, sahib?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I don't think the Rajah of Bhurtpoor will harm us. He must feel that his situation is almost desperate, and it would put him beyond the reach of pardon, if he were to massacre his prisoners."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The Jat had now dismounted, and could be seen making his way towards them on foot; sometimes coming straight, but more often making long bends and turns. It was evident, by the absence of any hesitation in his movements, that he was well acquainted with the morass.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "If that is the only way to us," Harry said, "it is marvellous, indeed, that we made our way so far."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I think, sahib, that it was the instinct of the horses. I felt mine pull at the rein, as I was leading him, sometimes to the right and sometimes to the left; and I always let him have his way, knowing that horses can see and smell better than we can and, as we were all in single file, you followed without noticing the turns."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In ten minutes the man arrived. He spoke to Harry, but his language differed widely from either Mahratti or that spoken by the people of Bengal. However, he signed to the troopers to lay down their arms and, when they had done so, started to rejoin the others; and, leading the horses, the party followed. The path was fairly firm, and Harry had no doubt that it was used by fowlers, in search of the game with which, at certain seasons of the year, the lakes and morasses abounded.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When they arrived at the edge of the swamp, where the others were awaiting them, Harry handed his sword to their leader. He and his party then mounted and, surrounded by the Jats, rode to Bhurtpoor. Their entrance was greeted with loud shouts and acclamations by the populace. Making their way straight through the town, which covered a large extent of ground, they reached the palace, a noble building built upon a rock that rose abruptly from the plain. Ascending the steep path leading to the gate, the party entered the courtyard. Here the captives remained in charge of the horsemen, while the leader went in to report to the rajah.

</div> 
<div>
 Presently he came out, with four of the rajah's guard, and these led Harry and Abdool into the audience chamber. The rajah, with a number of personal attendants, entered and took his seat.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You are an officer in the English army. What is your rank?" the rajah said in Mahratti.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am a major."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Of what regiment?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am on the personal staff of the general."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And this man?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He is a native officer, at present commanding a portion of the general's escort."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How was it that you were alone, last night?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I had ridden to Agra, the day before; and was too late, in starting back, to gain the camp before it was dark. I lost my way and, finding that we were in the heart of the morass, we were obliged to wait till morning."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is well that you did not try to get out. Had you done so, none of you would be here now.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You speak Mahratti like a native."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I was some years at Poona and, as a child, had a Mahratta woman as a nurse, and learnt it from her."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The rajah was silent for a minute or two, then he asked:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Does your general think that he is going to capture my town?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I do not know, but he is going to try."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He will not succeed," the rajah said, positively. "We gave up Deeg, because we did not want a large force shut up there. Our walls are strong but, were they levelled to the ground, we would still defend the place to the last."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am aware that your people are brave, Rajah. They fought well, indeed; and if Holkar's troops had fought as stoutly, the result might have been different."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The rajah again sat in thought for some time, then he said:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I do not wish to treat you harshly. I can honour brave men, even when they are enemies. You will have an apartment assigned to you here, and be treated as my guest; only, do not venture to leave the palace--at least, unless you leave it with me. There are many who have lost friends at Deeg, many who may lose their lives before your army retires, and I could not answer for your safety. Would you like this native officer to be with you?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I should esteem it a great favour, Rajah. He has been with me for several years, and I regard him as a friend. Thank you, also, for your courtesy to me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You will give your promise not to try to escape?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As Harry believed that, in the course of a short time, the British would be masters of the town, he assented without hesitation.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The rajah looked pleased.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You need be under no uneasiness as to your troopers. They will, of course, be in confinement but, beyond that, they shall have no reason to complain of their treatment."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The rajah said a few words to one of his attendants, who at once motioned to Harry and Abdool to follow him. Harry bowed to the rajah and, with Abdool, followed the attendant. He was taken to a commodious chamber. The walls and divans were of white marble; and the floor was paved with the same material, but in two colours. The framework of the window was elaborately carved, and it was evident that the room was, at ordinary times, used as a guest chamber.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The attendant left them, for a few minutes.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "This is better than I had even hoped for, Abdool. There can be no doubt that the rajah, though he put a good face on it, is desperately anxious; and behaves to us in this way, in hopes that he may finally obtain better terms than he otherwise would do, by his good treatment of us."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He looks honest and straightforward, sahib. 'Tis strange that he should have behaved so treacherously, just after the Company had granted him an increase of territory."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We must make some allowances for him. No doubt, like all the Indian princes we have had to do with, he is ready to join the strongest side. He heard that Holkar was coming down with an immense army, and believed that we should not be able to withstand him. In that case he, as our ally, would share in our misfortunes. His territories would be ravaged; and he himself killed or taken back, as a prisoner, to the Deccan. He was probably hesitating, when the news came of Monson's disastrous retreat. This doubtless confirmed his opinion of Holkar's invincibility; and he determined, as the only way of saving himself, to declare for him."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The attendant now entered, with four men bearing cushions for the divans and carpets for the floor, large ewers and basins, with soft, embroidered towels, and a pile of rugs for beds. After he had retired, Harry went to the window and looked out. Below was the courtyard, and the room was on the first story.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, if we are to be prisoners, Abdool, we could hardly wish to be better suited. A fortnight's rest will do us no harm, for we have been riding hard almost ever since we left Agra with Monson's force."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is well, sahib, that you were with us when we were captured. Had we been alone, we should have had no mercy. It is because the rajah regards you as such a valuable prisoner that we have been spared.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "If you had not given your promise, I think we might have made our escape."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We might have done so, Abdool; but if I had not given my promise, you may be sure that we should not have been lodged so comfortably."
