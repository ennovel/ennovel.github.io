They were stiff, at first, from passing the night in a sitting attitude; but it was not long before they were able to break into a trot. This they kept up for an hour then, to their great satisfaction, the forest abruptly ceased, and they saw, at a distance of about a mile and a half, the little town of Johore, lying in cultivated fields that extended to the edge of the forest. 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They broke into a walk, for a short distance; and then continued at their former pace, for they could not tell how close their pursuers might be behind them. It was not long before they saw men at work in the fields. The interpreter shouted to them that a party of the enemy were not far behind and, throwing down their tools, they also made for the town, spreading the alarm as they went. Fresh and fleet footed, they arrived some minutes before Harry's party and, as these entered the place, they found the whole population in the street, the men armed with spears and krises.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Asking the way, they soon reached the rajah's palace, which consisted of a central house, round which a number of huts were built; the whole surrounded by a stone wall, some eight feet high. The rajah, when they arrived, was questioning some of his people as to the cause of this sudden alarm. He was greatly surprised at the sight of Harry, in his full uniform, attended only by one soldier and a native.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How comes it that you arrive like this?" he asked, angrily.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Explain what has happened," Harry said, to the interpreter.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The rajah's brow darkened, as he heard how the escort he had sent down had been slain, to a man, on the previous day. But his excitement increased, when told that a strong force of his enemy was gathered within a few miles of the town; and that an assault might be immediately expected.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Will you tell the rajah that I am used to warfare, and shall be glad to assist him, to the best of my power, in the defence of his town?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How many men were there?" the rajah asked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I should think there were a couple of thousand," Harry replied. "Some of them had matchlocks, but the greater part of them only spear and kris."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And we have not more than five hundred," the rajah said. "We cannot hope to resist them. What think you?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I will at once go round the town, and see," Harry said. "It may be that, being accustomed to war, I can suggest some means of so strengthening the defences that we may hold them against the enemy."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The rajah, having heard many tales of the fighting powers of the whites, said:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I will go with you. I would defend the place if I could for, if Johore were lost, I should be but a fugitive. All within it would be killed, and I should have to beg an asylum from those over whom I was once master."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Calling a party of his men to follow him, the rajah accompanied Harry to the edge of the town. It was already surrounded by a palisade; but this was of no great strength, and its circumference was fully a mile and a half.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Tell the rajah that we could make a first defence, here, but his fighting men are not numerous enough to hold so large a circuit against four times their number. I should suggest that the whole population should be set to work to build another palisade, much nearer to the palace. All the women and children should be sent inside this, all the provisions in the town be taken into the palace enclosure, and a large supply of water stored there.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "As soon as the new palisade is finished, all who can be spared from its defence should set to work to throw up a bank of earth against the wall; and upon this the fighting men can take their places, and should be able to defend the palace against any assault."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The rajah listened attentively to the interpreter.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The English officer's words are good," he said, "but we have no timber for the palisades that he speaks of."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Tell the rajah," Harry said, when this was interpreted to him, "that there is plenty of wood and bamboos in the huts that stand outside the line of the new palisade; and that if we pull these down, we can use the materials. Moreover, in any case it would be well to level these houses for, if the enemy fired them, it would be almost certain to fire the houses inside the palisade."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The rajah's face brightened. The tone of assurance in which Harry spoke reassured him, and he said to the interpreter:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Tell the officer that my people shall do just as he tells them, if he will point out where the defence must be erected."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry was not long in fixing upon the line for the entrenchments. It was some two hundred yards in diameter and, at the rajah's orders, the whole of the men and women of the town set to work, to pull down the huts standing within fifty or sixty yards of this. This was the work of a couple of hours, and the materials were carried up to the line. The stronger timbers were first planted, in holes dug for them; and the intervals between these were filled with bamboo poles. On the inside face other bamboos were lashed, with rattans across them. As fast as these were used, more houses were pulled down, until the defence was completed, the crossbars being some nine inches apart.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 This work performed, the men, women and children brought up what provisions they had, and their most precious belongings. These were carried inside the wall of the palace. It was two o'clock before the work was finished, and there was then a rest for half an hour.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Then all were set to work to dig a trench, three feet deep with perpendicular sides, at a distance of two feet from the palisade. A large store of bamboos that had been too slender for use in the palisade were sharpened, and cut into lengths of two feet; and these were planted, thickly, in the bottom of the trench. Others, five feet long, were sharpened and then thrust through the interstices between the upright bamboos; the ends being fixed firmly in the ground inside, while the sharpened points projected like a row of bayonets, at a height of some two feet above the edge of the ditch.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 It was nightfall before the work was finished. The rajah had, himself, been all the time upon the spot; and was delighted when he saw how formidable was the obstacle that had been raised. One small entrance, alone, had been left; and through this all the women and children now passed, and lay down in the space between the new palisade and the wall of the palace.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The men were ordered to take post behind the stockade, and a number of boys were sent out, to act as scouts and give notice if an enemy approached. The rajah, however, was of opinion that, as the enemy would know that the alarm would have been given by the fugitives, on their arrival, and that the inhabitants would be on their guard, they would not attack till daylight.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry had, at his invitation, gone up at midnight to his house, and partaken of food; which was also sent out to Abdool and the interpreter. The rajah would have continued the work all through the night, had not Harry dissuaded him; saying that, after six hours' sleep, everyone would work better.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 At one o'clock a horn was sounded and, with the exception of a few men left at the outer palisade, all set to work again. The men were employed in digging a trench, a foot in depth, inside the inner palisade; throwing up the earth in front of them, so as to lie protected from arrows and spears, until it was time for them to rise to their feet to repel an actual assault. The women and children filled baskets with the earth thrown from the outer trench, on the previous day, and carried it inside the wall where, by five o'clock, a bank two feet high had been raised; and on this a platform of bamboos, three feet high and eighteen inches wide was erected.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The work had scarcely been finished when a horn was sounded, outside the town; and the boys came running in, while the men ran down to the outer palisade. As day broke, great numbers of dark figures were seen, making their way through the fields on three sides of the town.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The band we saw must have been joined by another. There are certainly more than two thousand men there. They will undoubtedly carry the outer palisade. Many of our men will be killed, and many others will be unable to join us here. I think that it will be much better to rely on this defence, alone."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Having now great confidence in Harry's judgment, the rajah at once ordered a horn to be sounded and, in a short time, the whole of the men were assembled in their stronghold; and the entrance closed by bamboos, for which holes had been already dug, close together. Then short lengths were lashed across them, and they were further strengthened by a bank of earth piled against them.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Before this was quite finished, yells of triumph were heard as the enemy, finding the palisade unguarded, poured in; expecting to find that the inhabitants had fled at the news of their approach. They paused, however, in surprise, at seeing another line of defence outside the palace. Quickly the numbers increased, until a thick line of dark figures was gathered at the edge of the cleared space.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Inside the defence, all was quiet. Not a man showed himself. Doubtful whether the town had not been entirely evacuated, the Malays paused for some little time, while some of the chiefs gathered together in consultation. Then a few of the men advanced, with the evident intention of examining the defences.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They were allowed to approach within ten yards of the ditch, when a shower of arrows flew from the openings in the palisade; and two, only, of the Malays fled back to their companions. The fall of the others provoked wild yells of anger. A horn sounded, and the assailants rushed upon them from all sides. When within a few yards of the ditch they hurled their spears, and shot a cloud of arrows. A large proportion were stopped by the bamboos, but such as passed through flew harmlessly over the heads of the defenders; who replied with a far more deadly shower of arrows.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Leaping over those who had fallen, the enemy dashed forward. Those in front endeavoured to check their course, on arriving at the edge of the ditch; but they were forced in by the pressure of those behind, and the long spears of the defenders gleamed out through the openings of the bamboos, inflicting terrible damage.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In vain the assailants endeavoured to climb out of the ditch. The bayonet-like line of bamboos checked them; and the arrows of the concealed defenders told, with terrible effect, on the struggling mass. At last, at many points, the ditch was literally filled with dead; and the assailants were enabled to leap upon the line of bamboos which had so long checked their passage.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The advantage was but slight. The slippery poles were some six inches apart and, slanting as they did, afforded so poor a foothold that the Malays were forced to stand between them, on the narrow ledge between the palisading and the ditch. Here they thrust their spears between the palisade; but these were wrenched from their hands, and scores fell from the blows of kris, spear, and arrow; until at last their leaders and chiefs, seeing how terrible was the slaughter, and how impossible it was to climb the bamboo fence, called their men off; and they fell back, pursued by exulting cries from the women, who were standing on the platform behind the wall of the palace, watching the conflict, and by the yells of the defenders of the stockade.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Of these but few had fallen, while some five hundred of the assailants had perished. The rajah was almost beside himself with joy, at this crushing defeat of his enemy.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I do not suppose it is over yet, Rajah," Harry said, through his interpreter. "There are still some five times our number, and they will surely not retire without endeavouring to avenge their defeat. But I hardly think they will attack the stockade again. Possibly they will try fire, next time; and it will be harder to fight that than to keep men at bay."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The rajah looked serious.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes," he said, "they cannot return to their homes, and say that they have left five hundred dead behind them. What do you advise?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "They will hardly attack again today, Rajah; therefore I shall have time to think it over. But at present, it seems to me that our only course is to shoot down as many of those who bring up firebrands as possible. We have still a number of long bamboos left, and with these we might thrust away any burning faggots that might be cast against the palisade."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The rajah nodded.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That might be done," he said, "and with success, no doubt."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "With success at many points, Rajah; but if they succeed, at only one point, in establishing a big fire against the stockade; we must retire within the wall. They cannot burn us out there, except at the gate; and against that we must pile up earth and stones. But I should certainly recommend that the roofs of all the buildings inside should be taken off unless, indeed, you have sufficient hides to cover them. Still, we need not do that until we are driven inside the wall. It takes but a short time to take off the broad leaves with which the roofs are covered."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 During the fight, Harry had taken no active part in the conflict. He had divided the circle into three, and had taken charge of one division, Abdool taking another, and the rajah a third. They had each encouraged the men under them, and had gone where the pressure of the attack was most severe.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 On leaving the rajah, Harry joined Abdool.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "They will try again, Abdool; but I don't think they will try to carry the stockade by assault again."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "They will try fire, sahib."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That is just what I am afraid of. The archers will shoot down a good many of them, but in such numbers as they are, this will make little difference; and we must calculate that, at at least a dozen spots, they will place blazing faggots against the palisade."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Abdool nodded.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have been telling the rajah," Harry went on, "that the men must provide themselves with long bamboos, which they can thrust through the openings in the stockade, and push the faggots away. But even if we do so, we must calculate upon the enemy succeeding, in some places, in setting the palisades on fire."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That would be very serious; but of course we should go in behind the wall."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I do not want to do that, as long as we can possibly stay here. I think that, when night comes, we ought to make a sortie."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But are we not too few, sahib?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Too few to defeat them, Abdool, but not too few to beat them up. You see, the wind always blows, in the evening, up from the sea. I noticed it last night. It was quite strong. What I should propose would be to pull up enough bamboos for four men to go out, together, on the side facing the wind. Two hundred men should first sally out; remaining, as they do so, close to the ditch. When all are ready, they should crawl across the cleared ground and then, at a signal, attack the enemy who, taken by surprise, would be sure to give way, at first.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "As they attack, fifty men with torches should rush out and follow them, and set fire to as many huts as they can. As soon as they had done their work, all should run back, when the signal is given.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "There will be two advantages: in the first place, the sudden attack will disconcert the enemy, and render them less willing to expose their lives, by storming a place so desperately held; in the second place, the wind will carry the flame over the whole town, and I hope the burning fragrants will carry the flames over all the fields where the crops are dry; thus causing them much more difficulty in obtaining dry wood for faggots, and they will be exposed to our arrows, much longer, before they throw them against the stockade."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It would be excellent, sahib; but do you think the men would go?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Just at the present moment, they would do anything; they are half wild with excitement and triumph."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry presently went with the interpreter to the rajah's house.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have a plan to propose to you," he said, "that will render it much more difficult for the enemy to set fire to the stockade;" and he then explained his scheme.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The rajah's eyes glistened with excitement.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Nothing could be better," he said; "and there is but one fear, and that is, that the enemy will follow us so hotly, that they will enter through the breach before we can close it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have thought of that," Harry said, "and the order must be that, when the signal is given, the men must throw down their torches; and then each man must run, not for the hole in the stockade, but to the nearest point, and keep along outside the ditch, and enter by it. In that way the point at which they entered would not be known and, moreover, they would be able to enter more rapidly, and with much less confusion, than if they all arrived together in a crowd. A party would, of course, be left at the breach when they sally out and, the moment the last man entered, would replace and lash the bamboos in their position.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "If, however, we are hotly pursued, you and I, with your own guards, should remain outside, and keep them at bay until all the bamboos but one are replaced. This will leave an opening sufficient for one man, and we must fall back fighting. They certainly would not venture to follow us through so narrow a passage."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Two hundred and fifty of the men were brought inside the wall, and the rajah explained to them the duty upon which they would be employed. He told off fifty of them as torch bearers; explained to all, carefully, the plan Harry had devised; gave strict orders that no sound, whatever, must be made until they reached the houses and, at Harry's request, impressed upon them the absolute necessity for not allowing their ardour to carry them too far; but that torches must be thrown down, and everyone run back, as soon as the horn sounded.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 There was no doubt that the order was a satisfactory one. The men raised their krises and spears, and shouted with joy. In their present mood, nothing could please them more than the thought of an attack upon their assailants.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 All remained quiet, on both sides, until darkness fell; then the crash of falling huts showed that the enemy intended to use fire, and were about to begin the work of making faggots.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "They will attack an hour before daybreak," the rajah said; "or may, perhaps, wait till the sun is up for, in the daylight, those who carried the torches would not be so conspicuous, but would advance in the midst of their whole force."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "At what time are they likely to sleep?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Many will sleep early," he said, "in readiness for the fight. Others will sit up and talk, all night; but those who intend to sleep will probably do so, in a couple of hours."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you think that they are likely to place guards?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No; they will not dream that we should have the boldness to attack them."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Let us give them three hours," Harry said, "the sea wind will be blowing strongly, then."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The greater portion of the men who were to remain behind were to be stationed on the side on which the sortie was to be made, so as to cover the retreat of the others, by showers of arrows. The rajah's principal officer was placed in command here. His orders were that, if the enemy came on too strongly, he was to issue out with a hundred men, and aid the party to beat back their assailants. However, Harry did not think it likely that this would be the case. The Malays would be scattered all over the town--some, perhaps, even beyond the outer palisades--and before they could assemble in force, the party ought to be safe within the palisade again.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Just before ten, the two hundred men who were to make the attack sallied out. They were led by the rajah, while Harry was to lead the firing party. He chose this part, because he would not be able to crawl across the open space as noiselessly as the Malays could do.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 During the day, a number of hides had been hung on the palisades, so that the enemy should not notice that a gathering of men, with torches, was assembled there; and in order that the light might not be conspicuous at this spot, fires had been lighted at other points, in order to give the impression that the defenders were holding themselves in readiness to repel another attack. The bamboos had been removed, ten minutes before the party issued out. So noiseless was their tread that Harry, though close to the entrance, could not hear it; and when he looked out, as soon as the last man had passed, he could neither see nor hear anything. The men had all thrown themselves on the ground, as soon as they had passed out, and were crawling forward without a sound being audible.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry and Abdool had both armed themselves with a kris and spear. Behind them were the torch bearers, arranged four abreast.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 It seemed an age before the sound of a horn rose in the air. Instantly they dashed through the opening, followed by the men and, at full speed, crossed the cleared ground. Already the sound of shouts, violent yells, and the clashing of blades showed that the rajah's men were at work.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Scattering as they reached the houses, the torch bearers ran from hut to hut; pausing for a few seconds, at each, till the flame had gained a fair hold. In less than a minute, sixty or seventy houses were in flames. Harry had the man with the horn with him and, as soon as he saw that the work was fairly done, he ordered the signal to be blown. The torches were thrown down, and their bearers ran back at full speed and, half a minute later, the rajah's men poured out from the town. There was no pursuit, and the whole band re-entered the stockade before, with yells of fury, numbers of the enemy ran forward.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As soon as they did so, arrows began to fly fast from the stockade and, knowing that they could effect nothing, without means of breaking through, the Malays retired as rapidly as they had advanced.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Short as was the interval that had elapsed since the first signal was given, the town was, at the point where the attack was made, a sheet of flame, which was spreading rapidly on either hand. The hubbub among the enemy was tremendous. Upwards of a hundred had been killed, by the rajah's party--for the most part before they could offer any resistance--and not more than five or six of their assailants had received severe wounds.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Loud rose the shouts of exultation from the defenders, as the fire spread with ever-increasing rapidity; flakes of fire, driven by a strong wind, started the flames in a score of places, far ahead of the main conflagration and, in half an hour, only red embers and flickering timbers showed where Johore had stood. Beyond, however, there were sheets of flame, where the crops had been dry and ready for cutting; and the garrison felt that their assailants would have to go a long distance, to gather materials for endeavouring to burn them out.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 While the position had been surrounded by a zone of fire, the rajah had, at Harry's suggestion, sent the whole of the men and women to cast earth over the dead; piled, at four or five points, so thickly in the ditch.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "If the matter is delayed another day," he said, "the air will be so poisoned that it will be well-nigh impossible to exist here."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The rajah admitted this; but urged that his men would want to cut off the heads of their fallen enemies, this being the general custom among the Malays.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It may be so, Rajah, but it could not be carried out, here, without great danger. Our own lives depend upon getting them quickly buried. We have no such custom of cutting off heads, in our country, but that is no affair of mine. But the bodies now lie in what is, in fact, a grave; and a few hours' labour would be the means of saving the town from a pestilence, later on.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "When the enemy depart, I should advise you to build a great mound of earth over the trench. It will be a record of your grand defence and, by placing a strong stockade along the top, you would strengthen your position greatly. I should recommend you, in that case, to clear the space within it, as far as the wall, of all houses; and to build the town entirely outside it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 There was great dissatisfaction, among the natives, at being prevented from taking what seemed to them their natural trophies. But when the rajah informed them that the order was given in consequence of the white officer's advice, they set about the work readily and, before morning, the dead were all hidden from sight by a deep layer of earth.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The next day passed without incident. At nightfall a sharp lookout was kept, not only on the palisade but from the top of the rajah's house. It was thought that the enemy, of whom considerable numbers had been seen going into the forest, would bring up the faggots as closely as possible, before lighting them. Still, it would be necessary to carry brands for that purpose and, now that the ground was cleared of huts, some at least of these brands could be seen, even if carefully hidden.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 With the exception of the guards, all slept during the day; as it was necessary that they should be vigilant at night, for the enemy might, on this occasion, approach at an earlier hour, hoping to find the garrison unprepared. Harry and Abdool paced round and round on the platform of the wall but, although a few fires burned among the fields, no glimmer of light could be seen where the town had stood.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I wish I knew what they were up to, Abdool," Harry said, about midnight. "I don't like this silence."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Perhaps they have gone away, sahib."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, I can hardly think that. I believe we shall have another attack, before morning. They may bring ladders with them, for climbing the palisade; they may try fire; but I am convinced that they will do something.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The position is not so strong as it was. If we had had more bamboos, I should have set our men to dig another ditch, and defend it like the first; but they are all used up, now. I wish we had some rockets; so that we could send up one, from time to time, and see what they are doing."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Another hour passed, and some of the Malays declared that they could hear a sound as of many men moving. Harry listened in vain, but he knew that the Malays' senses were much keener than his own.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He went at once to the rajah. The chief had been up till midnight, and then retired; leaving orders that he was to be called, directly an alarm of any sort was given. He was seated with two or three of his councillors, talking, when Harry, with the interpreter, entered.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Your people say they hear sounds, Rajah. I can hear nothing, myself, but I know their hearing is keener than mine. I am uneasy, for even they cannot see the faintest glow that would tell that a fire is being brought up. In my opinion, we had better leave only two hundred men at the palisade, and bring the rest in here. We can lead them out, at once, if any point is hotly attacked; and it would prevent confusion, if the stockade were suddenly forced. The enemy may be bringing up hundreds of ladders and, in the darkness, may get up close before they are noticed."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do as you think best," the rajah said and, at once, went out and sent officers to bring in three hundred of the men; and also, at Harry's suggestion, to tell the others that, when the rajah's horn sounded, all were to leave the stockade and make at once for the entrance through the wall.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Another half hour passed. Even Harry was conscious, now, that there was a low dull sound in the air.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I cannot think what they are doing," the rajah, who was now standing on the wall, close to the gate, said to Harry. "However numerous they may be, they should have moved as noiselessly as we did, when we went out to attack them."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I don't think that it will be long before we know, now, Rajah."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He had scarcely spoken, when there was a loud shout from the palisade in front of them. It was on this side that the men had been posted so thickly, as it was of all things necessary to defend this to the last, in order to enable those at other points to make their way to the gate. The shout of alarm was followed, almost instantly, by the sound of a horn and, immediately, a tremendous yell resounded on all sides.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 It was answered by the shouts of the garrison and, a moment later, a score of balls composed of matting, dipped in oil or resinous gum, were thrown flaming over the palisades. These had been prepared the previous day, and the men charged with throwing them had each an earthenware pot, containing glowing charcoal, beside them. Their light showed groups of men, twenty or thirty strong, advancing within twenty yards of the palisade.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "They are carrying trees, to batter down the stockade, Rajah!" said Harry.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Behind the carrying parties was a dense crowd of Malays, who rushed forward as soon as the fireballs fell, hurling their spears and shooting their arrows, to which the defenders replied vigorously.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The stockade will not stand a moment against those trees," he continued. "'Tis best to call the men in, at once."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The rajah ordered the native beside him to sound his horn and, in two or three minutes, the men poured in at the entrance. As soon as the last had come in, the bamboos were put in the holes prepared for them, with some rattans twined between them. Scores of men then set to work, bringing up the earth and stones that had been piled close at hand.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In the meantime, the three hundred men on the walls kept up a shower of arrows on the enemy. The battering rams, which consisted of trees stripped of their branches, and some forty feet long and ten inches thick, did their work and, by the time the entrance was secure, the Malays poured in with exultant shouts.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A large supply of the fireballs had been placed on the platforms and, as these were lighted and thrown down, the assailants were exposed to a deadly shower of arrows as they rushed forward. At this moment the rajah's servant brought up four double-barrelled guns.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "They are loaded," the chief said, as he handed one of these to Harry.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How long is it since they were fired?" the latter asked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is three months since I last went out shooting," the rajah replied.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry at once proceeded to draw the charges.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I should advise you to do the same, Rajah. A gun that has not been fired for three months is not likely to carry straight, and is more dangerous to its owner than to an enemy."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The rajah called up two of his men, and one of these at once drew the charges of the guns, and reloaded them from the powder horn and bag of bullets the servants had brought.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The enemy did not press their attack, but retired behind the palisades and, from this shelter, began to shoot their arrows fast, while a few matchlock men also replied.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It would be as well, Rajah, to order all your men to sit down. There is no use in their exposing themselves to the arrows, and they are only wasting their own. We must wait, now, to see what their next move will be. Fire will be of no use to them, now; and the wall will take some battering before it gives way and, brave as the men may be, they could not work the battering rams under the shower of spears and arrows that would be poured upon them.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I should send the greater part of your men down to get off the roofs of the huts. Those up here must place a man or two on watch, at each side, and throw a fireball occasionally."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In a few moments the enemy ceased shooting their arrows, for the light of the fireballs showed them that the garrison was in shelter.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "There is no occasion for you to stay here, any longer, Rajah. I will look after matters until morning, and will send to you, as soon as there is any stir outside."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In half an hour, the huts were stripped of their most combustible material. This was heaped up under the platforms, where it would be safe from falling arrows. The women drew pots of water from the well, and a hundred men were then left in the courtyard, with orders to pull up or stamp out any flaming arrows that might fall. But as the time went on, it was evident that the assailants had not thought of providing themselves with the materials requisite, and the greater part of the garrison lay down quietly and slept.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry had waited until he saw the work in the courtyard completed; and then, with the interpreter, entered the rajah's house. The room he generally used was empty. Some lamps were burning there, and he laid himself down on a divan, while the Malay curled himself up on the floor.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry had slept but a short time when he was awakened by a light touch on his shoulder and, springing up, saw a woman, with a boy some six years old, standing beside him. The woman placed her finger on her lips, imploringly. Harry at once roused the interpreter. Through him, the woman explained that she was the widow of the late rajah, and that her son was the lawful heir to the throne.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have come to you, brave white lord," she said, "to ask you if your people will grant us protection."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That would be impossible," Harry replied; "my people are busy with their own wars in India and, even were they not so occupied, they could not interfere in a domestic quarrel between the Malay chiefs."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Why are you fighting here, then?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am fighting in my own quarrel. I was attacked, and my followers killed, by the rajah now assailing this place. I, myself, should have been murdered, had I not made my escape; and should certainly be killed by him, if he were victorious.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I think it likely that, before very long, there may be an English trading station at Singapore and, if you and your son were to go there, you would certainly be well received. I shall, of course, relate your story, which I have already heard, on my return to Calcutta; and on my explaining that your son is entitled to the throne of Johore, it may be that some sum would be granted for your maintenance; for it may well be that, in time, the throne may again become vacant, and that the people, tired of these constant wars, will unite to accept your son as rajah. I may tell you that I am sure the tumangong will grant us a trading station, and possibly the whole island; but as he is not the Rajah of Johore, although at present independent of him, we should like to have his assent to the cession. It is for this purpose I have come here although, up to the present time, I have not said anything about it to the rajah, as we have both been much too busy to talk of such matters.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It may be years before the English come to Singapore; but my report will certainly be noted and, assuredly, an asylum would be granted you, and you would be kindly received. I can say no more than that."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Thanks, my lord, I could have hoped for no more. Forgive me for having thus disturbed you but, as all in the house save ourselves are asleep, I thought that it was an opportunity that would not occur again. I will teach my son that the English are his friends and, should aught happen to me, and should he ever become rajah here, he will act as their friend, also."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When this had been interpreted to Harry, she and the boy left the room, as noiselessly as they had entered. Harry was well pleased with the interview. Probably the present man would, when the result of this struggle became known, regain much of the power he had lost. Assuredly, as long as he remained rajah, he would now be ready to grant anything asked for and, as Singapore was virtually lost to him, his assent would be given without hesitation. If, on the other hand, he were dethroned, or died, it was likely that this boy would in time become rajah and, in view of this possibility, doubtless the Governor would order that if, at any time, he and his mother arrived at Singapore, they should be well received.
