Th is would mean you have an outside source. You need to be aware I could fi nd your source if it becomes important.” Penelope smiled as she wondered who was bluffi ng now. Th e senator read her face perfectly. “Since you deal in the written word, it has to be one of five print news organizations. The New York Times and Th e Boston Globe are out since they are still nosing around this story, and they would have assigned a staff reporter who would have presented his credentials. Th at leaves The Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, or L.A. Times. Since they know their competitors have not honored the government’s request to back off the story, they would not want to be caught flatfooted if all heck breaks loose. It would be in their interest to continue working on the story, but they would need to turn it over to someone outside their organization to give them plausible deniability. It would have to be someone good and someone they trust.” The senator’s eyes bored into Penelope Spence. “Someone they had a personal relationship with.” Penelope shifted uncomfortably in her chair. “Someone in one of these three news organizations is going to have a connection to you. Since I 35 The Fourth Awakening influence a large portion of their budget, how long do you think it would take for a certain federal agency to find that person for me?” Senator Clayton Horn, even in his later years and in declining health, was a formidable force. “I gave my word…” Horn held up his hand. “I will not ask you again to violate that trust. I just need you to understand that if I can fi nd your source in less than an hour with a single phone call, so can people who may be less friendly. And I must warn you, by working on this story without the protection of a major news outlet you may be placing yourself in grave peril. Th ere are many people who will go to great lengths to keep what Michael Walker is working on out of the public domain.” Penelope leaned back in her chair as she absorbed the senator’s words; he was not a man of hyperbole. What in the world had this Walker character done? “Many is a pretty ambiguous word, senator. Who exactly would go to such lengths to keep this story quiet?” “By reflex, all of the intelligence agencies want everything classifi ed. They would slap a ‘Top Secret, compartmentalized’ stamp on the lunch menu at the CIA cafeteria if we let them. But this is diff erent. Th e rumors surrounding a possible breakthrough in Walker’s research have put a scare into some very powerful people.” “For example.” Horn chuckled. “Where to start? First, there would be many of the religious leaders, worldwide. Anyone who is currently in power in any of the governments of any country in the world and, of course, all of the wealthy people on the planet would want this suppressed. Th ere are around seven billion people currently residing on earth, and I would guess that Walker, and to a lesser degree you, should consider about a billion of them as your mortal enemy. Myself, included.” It took Penelope Spence a moment to allow all of this additional information to sink in. Senator Horn was not prone to exaggeration, which lent power to his words. “Why do you include yourself in the group?” she asked soft ly. “As you may know, I consider myself a religious man, and I believe what Walker is doing to be sacrilege. I’m the one who put a stop to the project.” “Really? Why?” 36 Rod Pennington &amp; Jeffery A. Martin “Before I answer that, let me ask you a couple of questions. Do you consider yourself a religious person?” Penelope Spence leaned back in her chair and studied the senator. He was famous for his strong beliefs, but this seemed an odd question even for an openly devout, born-again Christian. If Penelope had been asked that question two years ago she would have answered with a confi dent, “no.” While she considered herself spiritual and believed in a higher force, the nature of organized religion had always left her cold. But lately she had been feeling a tugging. At first she thought it was the sudden change in her life situation that had rattled her self-confidence, but with each passing day, the pull became stronger. “Yes,” she heard herself say. “Do you attend church regularly?” “No.” “Is there a reason?” “Senator, I’m not sure…” “Please. Just bear with me and this just might turn out to be your lucky day. Is there a reason you don’t attend church regularly?” “I just don’t think much of organized religion.” “Why is that?” Penelope sighed. “Organized religion, with its rigid dogma and antiquated sexist and ethnocentric rules, just doesn’t appeal to me.” Senator Horn nodded his head in agreement. “You’re not alone. Did you know the fastest growing faith organizations in the United States are non-denominational fellowships where the goal is to speak directly to God without going through the rules of a traditional organized religion?” Horn didn’t wait for an answer. “Have odd things started happening to you, things that can’t be explained logically?” “Senator….” “Please, this is important.” Penelope thought about the risotto, knowing the location of her son’s missing dog, and a series of similarly dramatic events that had occurred recently. “Yes, senator, they have.” “That’s what I thought. When your name came up this morning for the first time in a year, I knew I would be seeing you soon. Penelope, Michael Walker and the Hermes Project may have set events in motion that, if not stopped, could mean the end of the world as we know it.” The hair stood up on Penelope Spence’s arms. Senator Clayton Horn 37 The Fourth Awakening was a devout man. He didn’t drink, smoke, womanize or gamble. Th e worst that had ever been said about him was that he occasionally sang too loud in choir practice. When he took the floor of the U.S. Senate, all conversations ceased and reporters reached for their notebooks. He was a serious man that everyone took seriously. For the senator to verbalize this level of concern to a reporter, even off the record, was stunning. “What exactly is the Hermes Project?” “That’s on a need to know basis.” “What can you tell me?” “You can’t expect me to honor your clearance when you enter this offi ce as a reporter. At this point, everything I’m going to give you is either a matter of public record or something you could get with a “Freedom of Information Act” request.” Horn paused, leaned back in his chair and continued to study her, and the situation, carefully, “As I’m sure you know, the government funds thousands of small-scale research projects every year. What you may not know is if we consider the research to be vital to national security we can take control of the project and move it to a top secret lab. In addition to our federal facilities, there is a group of large and small companies that further this type of research for us.” “One of them is Walker Industries.” “They are among the largest. They are currently involved in projects for the Department of Defense and Homeland Security that are so classifi ed they are only referred to by code names, even in our closed committee meetings. Obviously I can’t talk about any of those projects with a reporter.” “Are these the ‘black’ projects I occasionally hear whispers about?” “That’s a bit overwrought. The government is involved in some secret research projects that are performed by private and publicly held companies, with strict oversight.” “What type of research were they doing at the Hermes Project?” “It was just your basic, garden variety university research grant that started to show some potential, and Homeland Security turned it over to Walker Industries. At some point, Michael Walker took a personal interest in it and then all kinds of strange things began to happen.” “What kind of things?” Horn shook his finger at Penelope. “I’m already telling you more than I probably should. But knowing you like I do, you’d ferret out the rest soon 38 Rod Pennington &amp; Jeffery A. Martin enough.” Penelope felt her cheeks darken slightly from the compliment, though she knew Horn was probably playing her like a well tuned piano. He hadn’t spent decades in Washington to have a conversation like this out of the goodness of his heart. “I received some reports that I found particularly disturbing, and over the strong objections of Homeland Security and some of the others on the committee I used my influence to have the project cancelled. Walker Industries was not happy about this and not only advised that we continue with the research, they recommended strongly we substantially increase the funding. In addition to an impressive list of scientists, Walker himself and an Assistant Director of Homeland Security’s Emerging Technologies Division appeared before my committee to try and convince me to withdraw my objection.” “What was your objection?” “Sorry, that’s a bridge too far,” Horn said with a shake of his head. “I’d made up my mind and am still convinced it was the right decision. When we cancelled the Hermes Project, I thought that would be the end of it. But Mr. Walker decided to finance the entire project from his personal funds. When I found out what he was doing I moved to reacquire the project…” “Reacquire?” “Yes. We always have the option to take back a project even if it has been cancelled.” “Then why haven’t you taken this project back?” Senator’s Horn’s nostrils flared with anger. “Until two weeks ago, we hadn’t been able to locate Walker or any of the original people involved with the research.” “Two weeks? I was under the impression he was arrested just a few days ago.” Senator Horn’s cheeks flushed and his eyes narrowed. “I can’t comment on that other than to say there have been some complications in detaining Mr. Walker.” “What does that mean?” “We’ve had some difficulty holding him in various detainment facilities.” “His lawyers were able to get him out?” “If only it were that simple.” 39 The Fourth Awakening “What does that mean?” “It means we’ve had some difficulty holding him in various detainment facilities.” “Okay,” Penelope said with a shrug. “So he was ordered to the Charleston Consolidated Brig?” “No comment.” “Walker really has gotten under your skin, hasn’t he?” “I think Walker orchestrated the entire defunding of the project just so he could get personal control of it.” “Is he that smart?” “I think he intentionally provoked me because he knew how I would respond.” Horn ran his fingers through his thinning hair. “If I had my way, Walker Industries would lose all of their government contracts. But, his lawyers shielded the corporation from any punitive action and our legal staff hasn’t found a way around it, yet.” “I’m guessing he won’t be getting any more contracts from your committee.” “I only have one vote on the committee, and I’m a lame duck.” Horn sighed as he regained his composure. “He played me beautifully, but I have to admit some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to be enjoying this a bit too much. As strongly as I feel that Hermes should be buried in a deep hole and forgotten, there are those who believe just as strongly that it is too important to be kept secret.” Horn again nervously ran his fingers through his thinning hair. Was that the senator’s “tell” Penelope wondered; the little nervous habit he didn’t even know he was doing that would tip his hand? She had never seen him this fidgety. Even if it was, she had no idea what it meant. Th ere was obviously a lot more to this story that he was unable or unwilling to share. “Well,” Horn said with a sigh. “Politics is not for the faint of heart.” “So, let me be sure I have this straight. Walker took this Hermes Project underground to keep you from reacquiring it.” “Yes. He completely funded the project from his personal wealth so Walker Industries was protected. Since we couldn’t find him to serve a subpoena or give him a notification of reacquisition, he was technically not even in violation of the law. Now that he has been served and has so far refused to reveal the location of the project, we’ve been able to employ 40 Rod Pennington &amp; Jeffery A. Martin the full force of the federal government in the search for his lab, even though he still hasn’t broken any laws.” “What do you mean?” “As with all legal documents, there is a time frame for compliance. He has 30 days to turn over the Hermes Project and is still within the grace period.” In deference to Senator Horn, Penelope fought the urge to smile; but she had to respect Walker. Whatever he was up to, to have so thoroughly flummoxed one of the most powerful figures on Capitol Hill was no small feat. “Does the government still have an interest in reacquiring the Hermes Project?” “When I realized we’d been had by Walker, we attempted to revive the program using the original data and techniques, but we failed miserably. Apparently, this is quite common for this type of research.” “So you won’t tell me why the Hermes Project was cancelled?” “No. Even if you were working for me on this, the actual research and the reason for the cancellation are outside your clearance. Besides, it may all be moot soon.” “What does that mean?” “The Executive Branch is ready to declassify, but they won’t do it without the approval of the oversight committee and Homeland Security.” “Can’t they declassify something whenever they want?” “Technically, yes. But from a practical standpoint it would be potential political suicide. They’re looking for some cover in case this blows up in their faces. Walker can be pretty slippery and no one is completely sure what he’s up to.” “How does your committee feel?” “They’re in the same boat as the administration. No one wants to be on the wrong side of this one in an election year. But, Walker’s infl uence only goes so far and until I’m replaced on the committee next January, I hold the swing vote.” “So with one phone call you could declassify the Hermes Project?” “The administration will still need the buy in from Homeland Security. I seriously doubt they would declassify without it.” Senator Clayton Horn shook his head. “I would give anything to know if the rumors are true.” 41 The Fourth Awakening Penelope, tired of talking in circles, paused for a moment before something occurred to her. “If Michael Walker is still in the 30-day grace period for compliance, why has he been arrested?” “He hasn’t been arrested. He has been detained.” “Okay. Why has Michael Walker been detained?” “Homeland Security was able to convince a judge that Walker was a potential threat to national security and a flight risk, so a sealed warrant was issued giving them the right to detain him until the 30 day grace period is up.” “Arrested, detained. It sounds like a difference without a distinction. What will it take for him to get released?” “He will have to tell us where he moved the Hermes Project, and what he’s been up to for the past six months. We also want to know the whereabouts of all of the missing people. A number of them have extremely high security clearances and inside knowledge of many very sensitive projects.” “Do you have sealed warrants out for them?” “No comment.” “Do you think Walker would have harmed them in any way?” “I’m a pretty good judge of people, but he is tough to read. I’m guessing that they are fine and will be as long as he still needs them.” “That sounds menacing.” “It wasn’t intended to be. It’s just that Michael Walker is one of the most exasperating people I’ve ever come across.” “What do you mean?” “In one breath, he is the most charming man I’ve ever met, but before long I feel like I’m in the middle of an Abbot and Costello routine trying to figure out who is on fi rst.” “I don’t understand.” “For an obviously well-educated man he has some of the most bizarre ideas I’ve ever heard.” “I’ll have to take your word for that, senator.” “I might be able to help you there.” “How so?” “If we can come to an understanding, I might be able to assist you with your story.” “What kind of understanding?” 42 Rod Pennington &amp; Jeffery A. Martin “All I want to know is where all of his people have gone and what he has been doing for the past six months.” “That’s the story I’m trying to write.” “I know.” “You’ll be able to read all about it if I succeed.” “So you agree that we share the same interests and there would be no conflict in providing me with everything you discover?” “Aft er publication.” “How about a few hours before you go to press so I can be ready?” “No prior censorship?” “I give you my word.” “What’s in this for me?” Penelope asked. Senator Horn’s eyes twinkled.
