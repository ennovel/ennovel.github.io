</p><p>Editor:&nbsp;</p><p>EndlessFantasy TranslationBoth Ji Fei and Shui Jing’s faces were filled with excitement as they bustled over to the Snake Knife, which had been tossed by Wen Leyang, before retrieving it.Zhui Zi, on the other hand, was smiling as she stretched out her hand and dripped a drop of soul-condensing cold dew on the rabbits’ heads. The big and small demon rabbits immediately turned back into their human form and hastily began to put on their clothes…Thousands of cultivators on Goddess Peak stared in bewilderment at the scene. After a long while, Grandfather Pig from the Pig Cat Red Army spat out a mouthful of foul breath as he muttered to himself, “This young lad here is… Too… Too motherf*cking bad!”Those around Grandfather Pig nodded strenuously almost at the same time.Wen Leyang’s treasured weapons were no doubt powerful and shocking but the most ironic part which made others wish that they could walk over and slap him was that his treasured weapons were all chained to one another. The Snake Knife could be summoned by the Bony Ning Jiao; the demon tower also concealed Guo Huan; the bug was the giant sword’s guide… Wen Leyang had now become exceptionally deadly.Brother Sang, Grandmother Shudou, and Hot Immortal Aunt were top sword immortals with exceedingly high cultivation bases. However, they were all injured by Wen Leyang’s trick of having his treasured weapon chained to another treasured weapon. Hot Immortal Aunt, who was the last to attack, wished that she could have reminded herself of that fact then!When Hot Immortal Aunt was being defeated by the Molten Metal Fire Bell, Sir Rust’s palms were crossed and he was about to attack. However, he had changed his attack pose when he witnessed Zhui Zi’s appearance.Ever since they had ascended the mountain, they had not paid much attention to Zhui Zi. It was only until she had revealed herself by first wiping away the Red-Base True Fire on Wen Leyang’s body before helping the big and small demon rabbits to break free from the noble-spirit treasured weapon’s suppression that Sir Rust had a realization. He finally understood that this woman, who had appeared fearful and would blush when she stared straight at someone, has a cultivation base which could only be described as ‘too deep to be fathomable’.When the Little Supreme Leader Liu Zheng saw that Zhui Zi has arrived, he immediately ignored the injuries on his body as he leaped up strenuously and ran over to her. He wanted to say something yet his lips could only quiver for a long while without making a sound. The pity on Zhui Zi’s face suddenly vanished as she nodded at Liu Zheng earnestly, “Please don’t worry, I will never allow others to insult those three who were closest to Tian Shu wantonly.”Zhui Zi then asked Wen Leyang once again, “How had the bug managed to summon the giant sword this time?”Ever since ‘You’ve Got Me’ had swallowed the Sword’s Resolve, it would jump out every two days and roar as it attempted to summon the Molten Metal Fire Bell. However, it had not been successful even once. They would watch ‘You’ve Got Me’ exhaust itself and its voice in calling out and feel anxious on its behalf without exception.Zhui Zi had inquired about this proud moment and Wen Leyang pulled the Little Supreme Leader Liu Zheng to his side as he said with a smile, “I’m afraid that the giant sword Molten Metal Fire Bell is somehow related to the Kunlun Sect!”Earlier, when the Little Supreme Leader had twice summoned the Kunlun Sect’s Sword Formation to resist the enemy, Wen Leyang could feel ‘You’ve Got Me’ suddenly turn scorching hot on his chest. The Fire Elemental Sword’s Intent from the Molten Metal Fire Bell had rippled from the bug’s body. Wen Leyang realized then that ‘You’ve Got Me’ was preparing to summon the giant sword once again.Following that, he recalled the sequence of events attentively once again. ‘You’ve Got Me’ had successfully summoned the giant sword twice. The first time was when they were in the witch’s territory in Shanghai’s Painting Town and the second time was when they were on the Geladaindong Snowy Peak. It was the Little Supreme Leader Liu Zheng who had launched the Kunlun Sect’s Sword Formation first before ‘You’ve Got Me’ could summon the Molten Metal Fire Bell! As expected, this time was no exception. Wen Leyang was in a splendid mood after he had figured out how the giant sword responded to being summoned. However, as for the relationship between the Molten Metal Fire Bell or the Sword’s Resolve and the Kunlun Sect’s Sword Formation, not one of them could understand that as of now.After Wen Leyang had retracted the devil fetus’ stone tower earlier, the old man Bao Ri had been too embarrassed to urge his supernatural power to condense in his hand seal. He huffed coldly as he ignored Wen Leyang’s mockery. However, he then looked straight into Zhui Zi’s eyes as he asked softly, “So, are you the demon cat Chang Li?”Before his voice could face away, Zhui Zi’s eyes turned bloodshot and her face flushed red as she complained in rage, “You… You are a venomous slanderer!” At the same time, she held Xiaowu tightly in her arms as if Xiaowu was the only person in the world capable of helping her to shoulder this injustice.Whatever the old man Bao Ri was planning to say was stuffed back into his mouth by Zhui Zi’s feigned misfortune. He stood on the same spot dumbstruck with his mouth agape, not knowing what to say anymore.At this point, Grandma Shudou and Hot Immortal Aunt have already regained their life vitality and temporarily suppressed their injuries. They staggered upright together and Grandmother Shudou’s gaze was burning with the heat of a scorching rage. She stretched out her hand and pointed at Wen Leyang as she scolded in rage, “You little swine who would stab someone in the back, what kind of a person are you actually…”Before she could finish her sentence, ‘You’ve Got Me’ suddenly jumped onto Wen Leyang’s shoulder and ululated as the hard spines on its entire body stiffened. It was in extreme anger and was about to release its treasured weapon after hearing someone insulting its master. Grandmother Shudou’s old face turned ashen and she took a step backward involuntarily. Soon after that, a white jade-like finger suddenly appeared before her eyes!‘You’ve Got Me’ had not unleashed the giant sword but it was Zhui Zi who had unleashed herself… The old woman turned pale from fear and her hands crossed in front of her as she attacked that finger. Soon after that, a muffled popping sound could be heard continuously!Sir Rust and the others shouted in rage simultaneously as they each brandished their treasured weapons or condensed their supernatural powers as they prepared to attack. However, their bodies suddenly felt chilled as gigantic ice spikes appeared out of thin air and froze them all within it in the blink of an eye.Everything had happened in a flash. Just as Sir Rust, Bao Ri, and Hot Immortal Aunt were breaking free from the ice, a crisp popping sound was heard as Zhui Zi tripped Grandmother Shudou. The old woman staggered and fell back several few steps before she managed to regain her balance with great effort. A layer of thick glacial ice had appeared on her shriveled, ghostly and claw-like hands all of a sudden.In the meantime, Zhui Zi has already returned to Wen Leyang’s side. She was holding Xiaowu in her arms once again and there was a sense of deep sorrow between her brows. “Since I have revealed myself, I won’t allow any of you to insult him anymore.” She then peered at Wen Leyang in a slightly fearful manner as if she was afraid that Wen Leyang would be upset.The old woman shook her hands repeatedly and she finally struggled free from the ice on her hands with an unpleasant scraping noise. Her gaze was filled with more astonishment than fear as she glared at Zhui Zi for a long while. Suddenly, she laughed in a strange manner which sounded more like cooing before saying, “You’re not the demon cat! It looks like you’re the surviving evildoer of that family on Geladaindong Peak!”Zhui Zi’s expression suddenly changed and within the piteously few memories that she had managed to regain, her memories were truly related to Geladaindong Peak. As for that so-called ‘family’, it should not be the Hua family which had just recently moved to the snowy peak in just over a thousand years.Each time she discovers a clue which was related to her past, Zhui Zi’s body would tremble gently involuntarily, making her appear weak and fragile until one pitied her.Grandmother Shudou glared at Wen Leyang once again and said, “Young lad, how about you. Who are you!”Wen Leyang had stuffed ‘You’ve Got Me’ back into his chest pocket and his gaze showed no signs of yielding as he glared back at Grandmother Shudou. He then replied dully, “It was you who had thrown words such as ‘wicked witch’ and ‘evil swine’ here and there earlier so you deserve the punishment which was served to you!” The expression on his face was cold yet he was blooming with joy in his heart. He felt satisfied with his statement and the depth of his statement’s meaning, as well as its enunciation, had been controlled to perfection. It sounded just like in the movies but the thousands of cultivators before his eyes were unimpressed. Whether these cultivators were acquainted with him or not, from the moment he had launched his attack earlier, they had understood that he was related to the demon cat somehow.Sir Rust suddenly took two steps forward and sneered gloomily as he said, “So you really are the demon cat’s companion…”Wen Leyang did not wait for Sir Rust to finish his sentence before he sneered back at Sir Rust, “So what if I am? At least we are not forcing the cultivators of the world to deal with all of you or to deal with Xiang Liu!”Sir Rust was bad at articulating his thoughts and he had not planned to debate with Wen Leyang. He struck his hands together and exploded a metallic clanking noise as he laughed hoarsely, “Since when has the demon cat associated herself with the surviving evildoer from Geladaindong Peak?” Following that, he then raised his legs and took a stride forward towards Zhui Zi!It seems that Sir Rust has determined that the truth has been revealed, that it was doubtlessly Zhui Zi who had murdered Bao Ri’s disciples in secret!Bao Ri appeared even more savage as his hands coiled up into the dharmamudra seal once again. He was one hundred and twenty percent confident that he could kill Wen Leyang in one strike. Though Wen Leyang was someone holding incisive and peculiar treasured weapons while his cultivation base was also rather shocking, he was still far weaker than any of them. AAs long as Bao Ri devoted all his attention to being vigilant, Wen Leyang would be the same as Liu Zheng, he was not a real threat to them.After Sir Rust walked past Grandmother Shudou, she also took quick strides and followed behind him. Though the old woman was severely injured, she was absolutely capable of fighting once again.Hot Immortal Aunt, on the other hand, ignited herself in layers of true fire with a booming sound. She then returned to Bao Ri’s side as she stared at Wen Leyang, Liu Zheng, Hope Voice, and those of her junior generation with hostility. The old monsters’ disciples too started to move with them. They completely disregarded the rogue cultivators as each of them leaped out of the rogue cultivator’s crowd. They walked in groups here and there messily as they gathered into a formation!Sir Rust’s footsteps moved continuously and his walking posture was very similar to the three-inch nail Wen Bushuo. Each step that he took was akin to a nail as he nailed himself into the earth and then pulled out his legs and took the next step firmly. He walked as if there was nothing between the heavens and the earth which could stop him from advancing!The sound of footsteps was sonorous and forceful, every step was accompanied by a metallic hum. As Sir Rust walked, the landscape that he walked past suddenly turned into a dull bronze color!Grandmother Shudou followed closely behind Sir Rust. Her seven silver-colored mud balls spun and shot out once again. At the same time, a sonic boom could be heard as the devil fetus’ stone tower appeared once again. It was suspended at the edge of the sky and resumed the mannerism of Mount Tai’s compression. The rogue cultivators pulled long faces as they gazed into each other’s eyes, this mountain was like an enormous psychological shadow for all of them…The Snake Knife and Bony Ning Jiao were not powerful enough while ‘You’ve Got Me’ was only occasionally effective. The main purpose for Wen Leyang to summon the huge mountain was because Guo Huan was still the most efficient one. Even though the huge mountain was rather impressive, it was a little less assured if he were to crash it. Before the end stage of perishing together with the enemy, this gigantic fatal weapon may not be necessarily useful.Zhui Zi appeared relaxed and she seems to be too lazy to even take one glance at Sir Rust who was getting closer. She even stretched out her hand and patted Wen Leyang’s shoulder, signaling him to stay calm and be at ease. Wen Leyang was slightly puzzled by this. Just when he thought that Grand Master Chang Li would sneakily attack, the sound of footsteps more ear-piercingly loud than Sir Rust’s echoed from behind the Five Blessings group!The people of the Five Blessings hastily gave way. After they had taken a closer look at the person approaching them, they all widened their eyes in surprise. A little gold-colored monkey, who was less than two feet tall, had a gloomy and cold gaze on its face while its expression remained innocent and foolish. It stomped its way forward step by step until the huge mountain shook ferociously as it walked towards Sir Rust without pause.Wen Leyang was overjoyed. Actually, the monkey Qian Ren had arrived not long ago. The head lama Rangjung, who was on friendly terms with the monkey, was helping him to protect Qin Zhui and Wen Shulin.Both of them were walking at a speed that appeared slow but in reality, they were quite fast. In less than a moment, the taller person met the shorter, one was a human while the other was a monkey. They walked forward together and a loud clanking sound soon broke out on Goddess Peak! It was as if both of them had been bathed in steel and forged in iron. Neither of them had used their supernatural power or treasured weapon. They only stretched out their fists and walked in strides as they started fighting on a grand scale. To everyone else, it was as if their ears were filled with seven or eight blacksmiths hammering way. It was not long before they were dizzy from being shaken by the violent battle between Sir Rust and the golden monkey. Some of the rogue cultivators with weaker cultivation bases even fainted while the lonely Chang Li was still standing on the same spot. Her huge eyes rolled upwards again and again as if she was pondering whether she should faint as well.Zhui Zi’s gaze was still innocently moving as she stared fearfully at Grandmother Shudou who had opened her mouth and was at a loss. She then asked, “Why aren’t you fighting?”The old woman had figured out during her battle with Zhui Zi earlier that if she was not blindsided by Wen Leyang, perhaps she could still have a fair chance of winning the fight against Zhui Zi. Now that she has been severely injured, she was absolutely no match for Zhui Zi in a one-on-one fight.The violent and thunderous sounds echoed for a short while before it suddenly stopped accompanied by the golden monkey’s shout. Sir Rust staggered back several paces as the color of rust on his face became even more mottled. It was apparent that he was on the losing end. Even the God-like King Gesar had not been able to kill the golden monkey. Sir Rust and Qian Ren’s fight of confronting toughness with toughness was, of course, a losing fight for him!A humming sound rose from the rogue cultivators as they whispered amongst themselves, converging into an unpleasant noise which made one feel agitated. The rogue cultivators felt that their trip to Mount Hua this time has been a bargain for them. The righteous path of the Five Blessings deserved the reputation of its name with the Little Supreme Leader Liu Zheng’s ‘A Thousand Swords Greeting’ as well as the little monk Hope Voice’s Great Mercy godly appearance… They had managed to witness all these supernatural powers which were practically unseen during the past few centuries. What was even more surprising to the rogue cultivators was that the most orthodox of all Buddhist sects in the world, the Great Mercy Temple, was being led by a demon rabbit.The five monsters have exceedingly high cultivation bases. How many other forces in the world would be capable of stopping them if they were to join hands? Each of their disciples could be plucked out and tossed into the cultivation world and they would still be able to open up a mountain and set up an influential sect. Finally, that Wen family young lad’s treasured weapons which had emerged continuously without stop had managed to wound three persons in the blink of an eye. Though there were more than treasured weapons which had emerged continuously, there were also master cultivators, master cultivators as powerful as divine immortals, the young maiden who always appeared fearful and piteous, followed by the innocent and foolish-looking monkey.Everyone was gasping with fear in their hearts. What kind of sect was the Wen family and how could they be supported by such vast influences behind their backs!Grandfather Pig from the Pig Cat Red Army looked at his three other siblings. He could no longer suppress the excitement in his heart as his voice trembled slightly with the suspicion of tears, “Today… Has been too decadent!”Sir Rust was a person of tough temperament and had crossed his arms as he fell back. Soon after that, he snapped his finger ferociously and his blood, which also appeared rusty, splattered everywhere. To everyone’s surprise, he had snapped his right hand’s index finger! The broken finger clanked as it hit the ground as if it was made from a heavy metal. Following that, Sir Rust shouted, “Broken Finger Golden Dagger!” His entire person jumped high into the air as he pounced towards the golden monkey!With a loud bang, that broken finger turned into an awe-inspiring golden armored warrior. The warrior pulled out a long sword from his waist with a scraping sound before pouncing towards the golden monkey in a flash!Almost simultaneously, Hot Immortal Aunt condensed her heaven-burning raging flames and a thousand streaks of fiery snakes coiled and surged before converging into a mighty fiery current which then swept towards the Five Blessings!Grandmother Shudou summoned her Seven Stars’ Revolve and combined her effort with Sir Rust as they pursued the golden monkey!The dharmamudra seal which had been frozen in old man Bao Ri’s hand was suddenly released and erupted with golden light between the sky and the land before it absorbed all the sounds and colors in the world. It was as if the sun had dropped into the mortal world and crashed ferociously onto the Goddess Peak!The golden monkey had immediately defeated Sir Rust the moment he had appeared. The other four old monsters were afraid that they would lose their chance at triumph this time which was why they made a tacit agreement to simultaneously launch a thunderous attack.There was a clicking sound as ‘You’ve Got Me’, who was as undependable as ever, stiffened its body from being startled as it watched the enemy approach them. Its two little black bean-like eyes widened before its body dropped stiffly from Wen Leyang’s chest. The giant sword seemed to feel that it was an embarrassment and had not jumped out to help it…The golden monkey howled in rage repeatedly before its tiny body suddenly turned into a streak of golden light that curled upwards. It dragged along layers upon layers of remnant shadows as it fought into a messy clump with the golden-armored warrior, Sir Rust with his broken finger, and Grandmother Shudou with her seven stars!“Break the demon body!” Guo Huan’s voice rang out rigidly as Yin’s Error and Yang’s Mistake were revealed once again. The Sun Knife was like the thick and never dissolving night as it immediately swallowed the boundless sea of fire which had been close to engulfing Wen Leyang. The Moon Knife was no longer as soundless as it was previously and it howled sharply from afar. It was rippling with a resolution which was undefeated by the heavens and earth as it slashed ferociously towards Bao Ri!Just as Yin’s Error and Yang’s Mistake appeared, Guo Huan suddenly laughed shockingly before saying, “This is decadent!”Zhui Zi’s eyes had brightened up as well as her excitement and joy wiped the sorrow between her brows away. She laughed along as her hand waved continuously, conjuring layers upon layers of sharp ice spikes with a loud bang. Just like the knives which were wild with joy, the ice spikes mercilessly shredded the golden light which was covering the sky.&nbsp;Her delicate and fragile body then swayed once suddenly as an inch of pure white-colored flame ignited from the end of her spring onion-like finger. She used that to attack the Hot Immortal Aunt who had been conjuring a fiery waterfall!The rogue cultivators who had anticipated the bustling scene to grow bigger and more exciting earlier had all screamed out in agony together. Those with better cultivation bases scattered and ran away in all directions while those with poorer cultivation bases fell onto the ground. Even though none of the supernatural powers being released had been aimed at them, the forces released when these top master cultivators had conjured their supernatural powers was not something which they could withstand at all.Wen Leyang’s heart was beating wildly in his chest as all sorts of supernatural powers erupted between the heavens and earth like a puff of scorching flames which caused his blood to boil immediately. The Wen Bucao’s disciples could be sinister, remorseless, and sometimes a little bit ruthless but they had no lack of inherent heroic bearing when they were faced with violent battles. As Wen Leyang looked upon this bustling scene, he would not stand aside and do nothing. A hissing and howling sound echoed from his side as the Bony Ning Jiao, which was akin to a divine dragon, appeared next to him. The Poison of Life and Death in his body was circulating and flowing rapidly. The poisonous power then spurted out of his thirty-six thousand pores and converged into a force which could collapse a huge mountain as he pounced towards Grandmother Shudou who had been standing closest to him!Xiaowu somersaulted in midair and landed onto the ground. She straightened her back and took one step forward before she stood in front of Fei Fei, shielding her. Xiaowu then raised the Mourning Staff and assumed the posture of looking for trouble. She appeared righteous and awe-inspiring. Fei Fei’s expression was normal, the true water cold dew which had been planted by Zhui Zi in her was strong enough to withstand the demon powers and divine rage that was wreaking havoc through the sky now. She chuckled as she wrapped her arms around Xiaowu and held her from behind.Xiaowu felt angry, she had been created with a body full of good skills but no matter where she went, someone was always holding her back. The golden monkey peered at Xiaowu in the midst of the pressing affair and his gaze was filled with sympathy for they share the same misfortune…Wen Leyang’s expression was ferocious with fire spitting out from his eyes. He dashed towards Grandmother Shudou savagely but just as he was about to dash into the battle, he suddenly felt a grip around his ankle. A hand had stretched out from the earth without warning and grabbed onto his leg! Wen Leyang’s posture of dashing forward was extremely strong and vigorous but this hand caused him to trip forcefully and all to the ground, surprised.Wen Leyang turned pale from shock. His immediately thought that the giant pangolin Po Tu was here but he soon sobered up as he realized that aside from Po Tu who would never create trouble for him, the Earth Elemental power which had been released from that hand was as hard as a rock and much stronger many times compared to the giant pangolin! The hand that was holding on to him at this moment was like a huge mountain, like the entire Goddess Peak!Grandmother Shudou seems to be completely engrossed in her battle with the golden monkey but just as Wen Leyang tripped and fell, the old woman suddenly laughed maniacally. She then turned around and raised her hand to shoot a golden-colored mud ball towards the top of Wen Leyang’s head like a meteor!Brother Sang, who had been lying unconscious next to Bao Ri earlier, had quietly disappeared unnoticed from the old man’s side some time ago. Wen Leyang felt exasperated for this group of monsters were all taught by the same master, they were all skilled in the act of feigning death!Some of the quick-witted cultivators were finally enlightened to the fact that these four old monsters had joined hands to deal with the golden monkey, Zhui Zi, and Wen Leyang. Though they may not necessarily succeed even with incisive treasured weapons, with the addition of Brother Sang who was formless, skilled in earth escape, and capable of ambushing in secret, their chances of success were now at eighty percent!The Bony Ning Jiao howled and hissed as it was about to scurry out and block the mud ball but unexpectedly, another hand had stretched out from the earth and held onto its tail with an accurate yet powerful grip. The Bony Ning Jiao then slammed heavily onto the ground with a booming sound.Wen Leyang’s mind was completely blank, there was only one voice in his heart – the person who was ambushing them was too shameless… Wen Leyang had completely forgotten about his pride when he had used his chain of treasured weapons to entrap the other party earlier…Everything had happened in a flash. The big and small demon rabbits; the head lama Rangjung; the Little Supreme Leader Liu Zheng; the little stutterer; Xiaowu; Wen Bushuo and Wen Buzuo; little Chi Maojiu; One Word Palace’s First Brother Xia and the others’ eyes were cracking with rage simultaneously. It was already too late for them to pounce over and rescue their companions. Even if they were able to do it in time, judging by that pair of hands which was capable of bearing the power of a giant river, they could not handle that as well!It was at this moment that Wen Leyang heard a pleasant laughter from beside him. That laughter sounds just like the pleasant rattling of ice cubes in a sour plum soup against a blue glazed porcelain bowl on a hot summer’s day. Suddenly, three streaks of pitch-black demon blades simultaneously appeared in the air!The first demon blade stabbed diagonally and firmly blocked Grandmother Shudou’s Golden Star mud ball on behalf of Wen Leyang. The mud ball and the demon blade then shattered in unison with a sharp clink!The second demon blade chased and pierced as it pursued Grandmother Shudou with lightning speed. The old woman did not even have time to dodge as she clenched her teeth and launched her star-plucking hand once again, attempting to rip the sharp blade into pieces. As a result, she fell heavily onto the ground with an agonized scream. Even though she had managed to snap the demon blade in the end, three fingers from her left hand were broken while one finger from her right hand had been chopped off. This was Grandmother Shudou’s proudest skill yet in the end, under the influence of her severe injuries and being caught off guard, her skill had been broken by the sharp blades which were charged with demon power!The third demon blade slashed horizontally and there was a popping sound before the reflection of blood could be seen. The blade had sliced cleanly through the hand which was holding on to Wen Leyang’s ankle.Chang Li looked just like a beautiful girl from next door as she took a step and walked out of the void. She then patted Wen Leyang’s head in a piteous manner. “You had wanted to show off your ability so you deserved to be tripped!” As she was saying that, she turned her hands over and dozens of demon blades appeared out of thin air before stabbing deeply into the ground!An inch of icy flame had condensed on the tip of Zhui Zi’s finger! This was her most incisive trick ever; water in its liquid state could pierce through rock and even steel. Ice at its coldest state could become a scorching flame which could burn the heavens! Hot Immortal Aunt was no match as Zhui Zi’s opponent as she has also been severely injured by the Molten Metal Fire Bell. The fiery waterfall which she had conjured was unable to resist Zhui Zi’s ice flame. It was then extinguished with a puff of black smoke while making a strange squeaking noise.Hot Immortal Aunt has no other way to evade the attack anymore. Just as the ice flame was about to pierce through her forehead, Zhui Zi suddenly disappeared without a trace. The fat woman, who had managed to escape from death, finally discovered the reason why she was alive after a long while…Zhui Zi had somersaulted her way back to Wen Leyang’s side. She then helped Wen Leyang to stand up in a great bustle. Her little, icy-cold hand caressed his chest repeatedly while her other hand swept away the sand and soil from Wen Leyang’s face continuously. She pouted her little mouth and looked like she was about to cry. “Are you in pain? are you in pain…”Hot Immortal Aunt understood just then that as a top master cultivator, her life was worth even less than the soil on Wen Leyang’s face in Zhui Zi’s eyes!</p> </div> </div> <div class="row turn-page"> <a class="col-xs-2" href="/The%20Immortal’s%20Poison/253.html?v=1662298015872">Previous</a> <a class="col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:center;" href="/The%20Immortal’s%20Poison/book.html?v=1662298015871">Table</a> <a class="col-xs-2 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:right;" href="/The%20Immortal’s%20Poison/255.html?v=1662298015873"> Next</a> </div> <hr></div><hr><footer class="container"> <p>© Company 2014</p></footer><amp-lightbox id="searchLightbox" class="-il" layout="nodisplay" on="lightboxOpen:searchInput.focus; lightboxClose:searchTriggerOpen.focus" scrollable="" hidden="hidden"> <div> <div class="-ic" role="button" tabindex="0" on="tap:searchLightbox.close"></div> <div class="-ih"> <div class="-sg -sb" on="tap: searchLightbox.close, AMP.setState({ query: '' }), searchForm.clear" role="button" tabindex="0"> <div class="ap-a-ico -sw"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#close"></use> </svg> </div> </div> <div class="ap-o-search-field"> <form action="#" action-xhr="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/echo" class="-ip" id="searchForm" on="submit:AMP.setState({ query: throttledValue }),searchResult.focus" target="_top"> <amp-autocomplete class="-id" filter="substring" min-characters="1" on="select:AMP.setState({ query: event.value })" submit-on-enter="false" src="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/autosuggest"> <div class="ap-a-ico -im"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#search"></use> </svg> </div> <input id="searchInput" class="-iv" name="q" placeholder="What are you looking for?" on="input-throttled:AMP.setState({ throttledValue: event.value })" required=""> <button class="-ig" type="submit" name="search-submit" disabled="" [disabled]="!throttledValue">Search </button> <div role="listbox"></div> </amp-autocomplete> </form> <div class="empty" [class]="query ?
