</p><p>Editor:&nbsp;</p><p>EndlessFantasy TranslationThe demon cat was proud and arrogant, her cultivation base was extraordinarily high. She spent a few thousand years creating troubles all over the world as she pleased, yet she had never been as shabby as she was now. She was pursued all the way by the Sword’s Resolve that was no stronger than a fool. From the moment she entered the Desert Rebel Mountain, she had already made up her mind to use Tuo Xie’s long sword that was contaminated by filthy poison and perished together with the Sword’s Resolve.She forcefully launched the ‘demon body breaking spell’ despite being severely injured, she took the risk of being tainted with the rare poison such that she launched the fatal attack and finally the poison of aqua blue that was about to invade into her meridians was drawn away by Wen Leyang. Chang Li was also almost on the verge of dying when she fell into a deep sleep.Xiaowu was truly petrified. Her little face was so ghastly pale it made one pitied her. She looked at Wen Leyang and Chang Li, “Are the both of them… dying soon?”“The demon cat is only severely injured, she will need to recuperate for a period of time then she will recover…” The corners of Cone Nail’s eyes were filled with deep sorrow. She looked towards Wen Leyang, “As for him… we will need to see if the Poison of Life and Death is capable of resisting Tuo Xie’s strong poison.”Upon saying that, she remained silent for a moment before finally spitting out four words, “We will see his creation.”Chang Li’s fatal blow earlier was imposing and threatening. However, from the moment Chang Li launched the demon body breaking spell until when the dust settled, everything happened in less than the time it took to blink one’s eyes. During that period, Chang Li raised the poisonous skeleton and waved the sword to stab the big-mustached man. Consequently, the strong poison of aqua blue that was placed by Tuo Xie two thousand years ago, which Chang Li was only tainted with ten or twenty percent of it, was all absorbed by Wen Leyang’s body.The Poison of Life and Death in Wen Leyang’s entire body condensed and trembled strongly along with Wen Leyang’s weak heartbeat. The poison was resisting the strong Poison of Aqua Blue desperately! The Poison of Life and Death was akin to a flock of sheep that was united yet fearful, the poison curled into layers and circulated around Wen Leyang’s vital parts of heart and chest, while the Poison of Aqua Blue was akin to a fierce and strange python, wriggling around the sheep flock as fast as lightning. Occasionally, it would probe its head and strike once…Even though the strong Poison of Aqua Blue did not manage to completely disperse the Poison of Life and Death all at once, the large flock of sheep could only wish to kill the strange python. Wen Leyang understood before he fainted for the second time. As compared to his previous experience of losing a finger, this time the strong poison that invaded his body was more than just a few thousand times stronger. There was no way he could completely expel and dispersed them. It was only a matter of time before the Poison of Aqua Blue dispersed the Poison of Life and Death.Before he fainted, Wen Leyang’s final thought was, “Before I die, will I still have the opportunity to wake up again?”Xiaowu’s eyes welled up with tears, she was about to say something when Cone Nail shook her head resolutely, “Send Wen Leyang back to his home!”The people on the scene albeit possessed remarkable cultivation base with extensive knowledge, not even one person was skilled in the Art of Poison. From Cone Nail’s point of view, if the few of Wen Leyang’s family elders were on the scene, Wen Leyang’s chance of survival would increase exponentially.Qin Zhui answered in response. He bent over and carried Wen Leyang on his back, while his arms held the golden monkey that could not move at all. On the other hand, Xiaowu lifted Chang Li while supporting Cone Nail simultaneously. The group of people was about to reel away and left the mountainside when a voice echoed from their backs, “Slow down! Wait for me!”Cone Nail was stunned for a moment before she understood who was speaking, she turned around and looked at Red Pot curiously.Red Pot inhaled a long breath, exhaled a long breath. Ots flat body followed its breathing as it continuously expanded, contracted, then expanded again. Cone Nail was smart and witty, she could tell Red Pot’s intention just by judging by its gaze. She asked in astonishment, “There is still more than half of the poison power left on the skeleton if you were to break forcefully be careful you might risk your life!” Chang Li and the Sword’s Resolve had removed a great portion of the strong poison on the skeleton. In the end, the skeleton was slammed onto the ground by the fist of the Sword’s Resolve and the strong poison prohibition spell had weakened.Red Pot’s gaze was beyond determined yet its voice was trembling in a manner that could not be suppressed, “The remaining poison power will not disperse by itself while I am growing weaker and weaker. If I do not seize this opportunity, I will never have this opportunity in the future!”Cone Nail smiled gently, “If you were to wish to break through the poisonous bones, I cannot help and will never help. Feel free to break through yourself, why is there a necessity to call out for me?”Red Pot’s tone of speaking was solemn, “You and I are bound by the common hatred of an enemy, it has been many years since I have not seen the light of the day, the world has changed since earlier, it is only a dream if I were to depend on my own to locate the enemy. Once I struggle free from this trap, I will still be leaving with all of you. That is why all of you ought to wait for me for a moment!”The moment Cone Nail heard of the words ‘bound by the common hatred of an enemy’, she frowned as if she was deep in thoughts. She was about to say something else when Red Pot suddenly shouted loudly, its flat body was akin to a balloon that was connected to an air pump. Its body expanded wildly as it started breaking free from its shackles.A moment later, the toad expanded its body rapidly. It squeezed into the skeleton’s chest cavity, the tyrannical color of aqua blue circulated all of a sudden. The muffled cracking sound that made one’s gum sore echoed continuously from the skeleton. Red Pot’s gaze was filled with agony, it gave out a painful croak from the depth of its throat…Finally, the toad and the skeleton were locked in a stalemate for a moment. At the crisp sound of a ‘pop’, the poisonous bones were burst apart by the giant frog!The moment Red Pot struggled free, it suddenly widened its mouth and gave out a raging roar loud enough to shake the heavens. Soon after, it was akin to deflated balloon as it rapidly returned to its normal form, the skeleton shackles were already shattered by it but Red Pot itself was also exhausted by the poison power. It lay on the ground and could not budge anymore. It could only pant heavily as it spoke to Cone Nail with great effort, “Bring me… together with you! The strong poison and my power of origin are neutralized. I do not have poison on my body…”Cone Nail did not waste time talking nonsense, she stretched out her hand and held Red Pot in her palm. The group of people helped and supported each other as they rushed back to the battle of Mount Hua.The Black and White Island, the Desert Rebel Mountain and also the vast wasteland where the big-mustached man was from were guided in by the magic formation. In simpler words, the magic formation on Mount Hua’s Goddess Peak shattered the void and opened three pathways. When the power of the magic formation had depleted, the three strange regions would each return to its usual spot.It was still easier to maneuver the Black and White Island, at least Cone Nail knew her directions but no one knew where was the Desert Rebel Mountain hidden. By then, it was afraid that she could not even find her way back to the Shu state. A group of weak and vulnerable surviving cultivators each urged their own life vitality led by Cone Nail, rushed towards the Goddess Peak before the Great Guiding Formation disappeared.After a long while, Red Pot regained some of its spirits. Occasionally, it burst out laughing, occasionally, it looked up to the sky and heaved a sigh, Cone Nail was very bothered. She pushed on with the journey while she asked, “What do you mean by we are bound by the common hatred for an enemy?”Red Pot was not in a rush to answer Cone Nail but it allowed her to talk about the events that had taken place beforehand…After Cone Nail was done talking, Red Pot first pondered for a moment then it spoke slowly, “The Great Guiding Formation is altered by the Chaos Brothers. That is why its power increases exponentially.”Cone Nail nodded and spoke, “The real magic formation is supposed to only guide that stretch of wasteland. As the big-mustached man received his immortal master teacher’s oracle, he had fully prepared himself to capture Chang Li. However, after the magic formation was tempered by the Chaos Brothers, the Black and White Island and Desert Rebel Island were guided in as well.” As she was saying that, Cone Nail frowned, “There is one more matter that is very peculiar. I have never figured it out all along. When we were still in the Desert Rebel Mountain, the wasteland had been guided in by the magic formation but the big-mustached man had never entered the Desert Rebel Mountain to pursue and attacked us. He waited for our return before he revealed himself…”Red Pot did not have a neck. When it shook its head even its buttocks were shaking as well, “Let us talk about the magic formation first. Have you ever realized that the thing that was tempered by the descendants of Chaos cone nail was only the spirit primordial energy foundation that launched the great formation? It was not the formation’s intent, otherwise, the big-mustached man could never possibly come out. The cultivator’s spirit primordial energy was initially used to launch the magic formation but afterwards, it was changed into the primordial energy of chaos by them…”The monsters from Shiwan Mountain each possessed the power of chaos while cultivators cultivated in the life vitality force of the heaven and earth. These two types of power were not the same.Ordinary cultivators were akin to coal balls while the descendants of the chaos cone nail and their workers were akin to batteries. Even though their mode of operation and presentation were different, their basic quality was still energy. The Great Guiding Formation that was delivered by the immortal master teacher was akin to the act of boiling water with the coal ball.If they wished to boil a pot of water, they would need nine hundred and ninety-nine coal balls. That was why Shudou, Bao Ri, Sir Rust and the rest visited Mount Hua to look for help. The descendants of Chaos also wished to boil the water but they did not have the coal balls but only batteries. That was why the Chaos Brothers changed the magic formation. They changed from the initial method of using coal balls to boil water, to using batteries to produce heat so they could boil water. (Author’s Note: In Cataclysmic Bean’s college entrance examination back then, I scored very poorly in physics, I simplified this in order to write the novel…)Yet, the act of boiling water was still the act of boiling water. It did not turn into the act of cooking dishes. The Chaos Brothers attempted to temper with the immortal master teacher’s magic formation but they only changed the mode of energy necessary to operate the magic formation and not the magic formation itself. Just depending on the Chaos Brothers’ cultivation base and their attainment in the magic formation, they did not have the capability to change the core of the magic formation.The energy that erupted from the batteries were stronger than coal balls. That was why the descendants of Chaos not only boiled the pot of water as instructed by the immortal master teacher, they boiled another two extra pots.That pot of water as instructed by the immortal master teacher was the big-mustached man that was hiding in the wasteland, while the two extra pots of water that were boiled by the Chaos Brothers were the Black and White Mountain and the Desert Rebel Mountain.Cone Nail only needed to ponder for a moment before she understood Red Pot’s explanation.Red Pot nodded, it was still shaking its entire body up and down. It appeared like a see-saw, “Since the formation’s intention remained unchanged, then when the three locations that were guided in, it should all be the same. Perhaps we could say that in between each of the locations, there was a deep connection.”Cone Nail did not stop her footsteps. She frowned but did not utter a word. She could not fully understand Red Pot’s explanation.Red Pot pondered on its own for a little while before it spoke once again, “You once said that in order for the cultivator, named Kong Nuer, to condense the demon-suppressing wood element cone nail on the Black and White Island, he framed the golden monkey. The heaven’s cone nails were also following by Kong Nuer’s side back then.”Cone Nail inhaled a deep breath, “I was once refined into the heaven’s cone nail by Kong Nuer as well.”Red Pot gave out a ‘heh’, “The big-mustached man that came from the wasteland to capture Chang Li, did he have the exact appearance of Kong Nuer?”The moment Qian Ren saw the big-mustached man, he was steadfast in recognizing him as Kong Nuer. It immediately advanced forward and fought desperately but the big-mustached man himself was completely ignorant, he denied stoutly.Seeing that Cone Nail nodded, a sense of murderous glow suddenly revealed in Red Pot’s eyes, “When I saw that Sword’s Resolve that was pursuing and killing all of you earlier, I thought that he was that bastard who swallowed me!”Cone Nail’s state of mind was absolutely alert and resourceful, but firstly because she was involved in the situation, secondly because recently the heaven water spirit failed to break the primordial spirit’s seal, thirdly because she had recently experienced a series of violent battles and her state of mind was unguarded on a few occasions, and fourthly she was concerned of Wen Leyang’s life, she could only feel as her mind turned into a ball of mess right now. Hence, upon hearing Red Pot’s words, she could not help but to inquire closely, “The person who swallowed you was the skeleton that trapped you? I thought he was killed by Tuo Xie…”Cone Nail was halfway through her speech when she suddenly closed her mouth. A layer of fear shimmered from her gaze!Kong Nuer, who designed the great formation to suppress a demon on the Black and White Island, the big-mustached man, who lived alone in the vast wasteland, and the skinny and small cultivator, who lived in seclusion in the Desert Rebel Mountain to seal off Red Pot, had the exact same appearances. The three strange regions out of the world of Black and White Island, the wasteland, the Desert Rebel Mountain were all guided in by the immortal master teacher’s magic formation…The three locations were supposed to coincide with each other. Even the people who were on guard had the same appearance. After the Chaos Brothers increased the horsepower of the Great Guiding Formation, all the locations were guided in together.Cone Nail’s mind broke into an uproar. The heavenly water spirit was showing faint signs of launching again. However, as they were exerting all their efforts to return to the Goddess Peak right now, they could not afford even a moment’s delay. Cone Nail concentrated, and slowly pulled back her life vitality, she clenched her teeth and abandoned the perfect opportunity to break through the primordial spirit’s seal.“Three top sword immortals that looked exactly the same each guarded a corner, the Black and White Island and the Desert Rebel Mountain were both the land of evil suppression. The big-mustached man in the wasteland, whatever he was doing there would not be too different from the others! That was why he could not travel too far. If the immortal master teacher wanted him to capture the demon cat, then he would need to use the magic formation to guide the wasteland near to the demon cat’s location!” Red Pot spoke louder and clearer, “Otherwise, what was the necessity for that bullshit immortal teacher to plan for some magic formation. He could just directly deliver an oracle to instruct the big-mustached man to leave the mountain to capture Chang Li!”The big-mustached man’s cultivation base and supernatural power were unparalleled in Cone Nail’s entire lifetime. It was not considered overrated if one were to describe him as the superhuman, who knew everything about the heaven and earth. Based on his abilities, even though the world was vast, it would not be considered a difficult task for him to apprehend Chang Li.Yet, the immortal master teacher had to first send out the descendants of heaven’s cone nails to make a move. When they failed, only he allowed the big-mustached man to go forward. His move was unnecessary and meaningless unless the big-mustached man still had other important matters to attend to. Unless it was the last resort, the immortal master teacher refused to allow him to make a move.Since the Black and White Island and the Desert Rebel Mountain were both evil lands of demon suppression, even Wen Nine could not be bothered to make a guess why the big-mustached man was hiding in the wasteland.Qin Zhui had been listening to the human and frog’s conversation, he finally understood. He was so astonished he widened his small eyes strenuously by a little, “What is the creature that is suppressed on the wasteland? Now that the big-mustached man is dead, should there be a monster running out of that place?”Cone Nail glared at him, “Do not mind which type of monster it is. If it has escaped then so be it, it is unrelated to us!” Upon saying that, she paused for a moment before she laughed, “Your master teacher is a monster too. Yet, he still managed to escape right?”Qin Zhui laughed dryly, “That is correct!”The golden monkey blinked its eyes, there was no way to tell if it was angry or injustice…Cone Nail laughed for a while. She was trying to make herself think clearly, she gradually frowned again, “These three persons here… are split bodies?”Red Pot peered at Cone Nail in slight surprise. He seemed to think that this was a very silly question that surprisingly came out of her mouth, “Of course. Even if they are the brothers of identical twins, they will never have such similar appearances!”Cone Nail brooded in silence. She was still feeling that something was wrong anyhow as if there was still some important clue that was floating away right before her eyes. Yet, she could never catch it regardless.Red Pot continued to speak, “The big-mustached men were humans. Based on their cultivation base, they had already turned from the one breath that melted into three pureness earlier. However, there was only one split body from the Sword’s Resolve. The big-mustached man who swallowed me in the beginning, he had only one split body as well. It was also a Sword’s Resolve. However, Tuo Xie’s poison power was too astonishing, he directly killed the Sword’s Resolve in the long sword with poison!”Using the human body to cultivate for the heaven, one was capable of refining into three split bodies. The split body that cultivated to its greatest extent was capable of refining into another split body. Based on the big-mustached man’s cultivation base, he should have cultivated into three split bodies earlier, yet whether it was the big-mustached man from the wasteland or the Desert Rebel Mountain, each of them only had one split body in the Sword’s Resolve. The only plausible explanation was the big-mustached man himself was another person’s split body.Cone Nail shook her head, “There is one big-mustached man that guarded the wasteland and Desert Rebel Mountain, but where did the Kong Nuer from the Black and White Island go?” Cone Nail recalled when she was acting as the heaven’s cone nail, the Black and White Island’s master cultivators passed down from generation to generation. The final few thousand years the island was protected by the three enlightened persons of Tian Shu. However, there was never the appearance of a top master cultivator like the big-mustached man there.The toad gave a humph, “Perhaps he had already died when the great formation was first accomplished yet there was no way one could tell…”This time even Xiaowu could not refrain herself from speaking, “The descendants of heaven’s cone nails received the immortal master teacher’s oracle, Kong Nuer was their immortal master teacher. If he was dead, then who was capable of delivering the oracle?” Upon saying that, she shook her head herself, “That is wrong as well. Judging by the Molten Metal Fire Bell’s power, it could only be used by a master cultivator like the big-mustached man. The giant sword and the Black and White Island were closely connected, so it should be Kong Nuer’s weapon, but… the Sword’s Resolve on the giant sword was sealed since earlier. So, Kong Nuer was already dead?”Red Pot’s gaze was beyond steadfast, “That is right! That Kong Nuer on the Black and White Island was certainly dead! However, since there were the split bodies, then there would naturally be a god-level body, the god-level body used the split body’s supernatural power to deliver an oracle to the inferior of his supposed split bodies. It was not a difficult task. The immortal master teacher that was mentioned by Shudou and Bao Ri was a split body while the person who delivered the oracle to them was the god-level body!”As it was saying that, Red Pot’s tone of speaking gradually grew more solemn, “The split body who framed me was albeit dead, the god-level body is still alive. He is the great enemy for you and me! Whatever the split body was doing, he is also doing it based on the god-level body’s instructions. He is not suppressing me with the reason of enforcing justice on behalf of the heaven. In the final analysis, the person who framed you and I was the big-mustached man’s god-level body!”Xiaowu also widened her eyes in surprise. As compared to the ugly youth Qin Zhui who was similarly widening his eyes by her side, she was so beautiful like a little fairy maiden. She shook her head, “Wait wait wait wait, the big-mustached man said the person who passed down the oracle to him was his master teacher. How was he unable to tell his master teacher and his master teacher’s god-level body apart?”At this point, Cone Nail’s mind suddenly froze. She was abruptly enlightened, she realized what was the clue that she did not manage to catch all along. The big- mustache man was completely unaware that he was a split body!When they first met the big-mustached man in the battle of Mount Hua, in the face of the indications from Qian Ren and the descendants of heaven’s cone nails, the big-mustached man’s face was filled with puzzlement all along. If he were to know that he was the split body, naturally, he would realize that these people were his other two split body brothers’ enemies or workers. In the situation at that time, the big-mustached man had the upper hand, naturally, there was no need for him to play the fool with them.The ugly youth Qin Zhui laughed and stuttered, “There are still other matters that I cannot quite understand yet…” As he was saying that, he inhaled a deep breath and was not bothered if others did not allow him to continue asking his question, “What is the purpose of the immortal master teacher to capture the demon cat? What is Tuo Xie doing now? The big-mustached man from the wasteland still had some other important matters on hand, then why did the god-level body not come here and captured Chang Li by himself? Why did Tuo Xie kill the big-mustached man from the Desert Rebel Mountain? He killed the big-mustached man on the Desert Rebel Mountain, why did he not kill the big-mustached man from the wasteland…”As Qin Zhui was joyously asking, the rest of the people shouted in unison, “Shut up!”The situation was chaotic to the greatest extent. Cone Nail, Red Pot and Xiaowu were confused since the beginning when they heard of Qin Zhui’s machine gun-like questions, they immediately felt a little crazy…Cone Nail gave a forced laugh as she shook her head, “We shall discuss further after we have sent Wen Leyang back to the Nine Peaks Mountain. We shall wait until Chang Li and Qian Ren can speak then we shall corroborate and discuss with one another, we may be able to think deeper too…on the other hand, if I were to regain the memories from my past life, perhaps I will be able to find some new clues…”While Red Pot was struggling itself free from the strong poison skeleton, it almost exhausted all its strength. It almost died out of exhaustion. Even though it managed to recuperate itself slightly now, its limbs were still limp. It could only depend on Cone Nail who was holding it while they pushed on with their journey. Yet the toad was in an extremely good mood after it struggled free from the trap, it was tossing and turning without in Cone Nail’s palm happily…Even though the few people were unbearably shabby, their footsteps were swifter than the ordinary people. Cone Nail stopped thinking about Kong Nuer, the big-mustachedd man, but she focused all her attention on pushing on with their journey. After she had calmed herself, she suddenly recalled something else. Her expression changed abruptly. On the Goddess Peak, other than the cultivators from the Five Blessings, almost half of them were made up of the descendants of the heaven’s cone nails!During the violent battle of the Goddess Peak, a group of demon immortals, heaven’s dragons, treasured weapons and the big-mustached man’s power of joint attack erupted suddenly. Everyone was affected. Yet, the difference was that their own people were dashing forward, while the disciples under the heaven’s cone nails’ sects were falling back together… in between the advancement and retreatment, naturally, there was a difference between their state of injuries. Moreover, the disciples of heaven’s cone nails initially possessed profound cultivation base…Cone Nail looked towards Xiaowu. The pursuit that came along with the violent battle on the mountain peak and also the uncertainties earlier made Cone Nail, who was quick-witted and well-composed on usual days, became confused. It was until this moment that she suddenly thought of, “How was Xiaowu uninjured at the time?”Xiaowu hastily described the situation that involved her being rescued at that time, Cone Nail felt slightly calmer in her heart. For this person was capable of rescuing Little Five and the rest in the midst of the tremendous force’s relentless attacks, the person’s cultivation base was at least of the same level as Shudou and Bao Ri. He was willing to save the people, at least he was not an enemy. However, who was this person …Cone Nail was starting to have another headache, she gave a forced laugh as she asked Xiaowu, “Who else was rescued by that person?”Little Five counted one by one, “Ji Fei and Shui Jing, myself, the siblings Fei Fei, Second Mother from the Miao clan…” As she was speaking, her huge eyes rolled up as she recalled with great effort. She finally shook her head and answered joyously, “That is all!”Cone Nail’s charming brow throbbed, “Wen Shulin?” Wen Shulin’s cultivation base was even worse than Ji Fei and Shui Jing.A sense of puzzlement appeared on Xiaowu’s face, she was suddenly reminded that there was still the old man Wen Shulin now, “It seems that I have not seen him for a very long time…”The few people were walking as they pushed on with their journey through the crossed layers of red hills rapidly. At this moment, a series of long howls suddenly echoed from afar, it was unknown which method did the surviving Five Blessings’ cultivators on the Goddess Peak used, they managed to temporarily suppress their injuries. They were calling out to each other as they entered the mountain to receive Cone Nail and the rest.Even though they were still lethargic, their cultivation base was less than twenty to thirty percent of their usual days, as compared to when Chang Li and the rest left, the cultivators were stronger and more high-spirited now. Judging by their state of injuries at the time, this was utterly impossible, Cone Nail was thinking beforehand that by the time she returned to the Goddess Peak, it was considered rather remarkable if these junior generation’s state of injuries did not continue to deteriorate any more. To her surprise, she did not expect that they even managed to regain a portion of theirs.The old demon rabbit, the little supreme leader Liu Zheng and the great master Rangjung were united as they walked at the most front. When they realized that the person who was approaching them was Cone Nail and the rest but not the big-mustached man, they cheered out in unison. They gathered over in an effort to help, while at the same time they raised their voices and howled aloud. They informed others to gather over as well.While Liu Zheng was escorting them, he explained the events that took place in the Goddess Peak in a simplified manner.After Chang Li and the rest brought along Wen Leyang and escaped into the Desert Rebel Mountain, the surviving descendants of the heaven’s cone nails rose in revolt as expected. While the people on their own side almost did not even have the power to face a battle and they were about to be at the losing side, a person leaped onto the mountain from the foothill. He was enshrouded entirely in a white robe with only a pair of eyes revealed. The moment he made a move, he shocked the enemies. The white-robed man did not bother the descendants of the heaven’s cone nails but allowed them to bring their sect master and left Mount Hua immediately.After the descendants of the heaven’s cone nails left, the white-robed man then left behind some injury-healing wonder potion for the Five Blessings’ cultivators. He then turned around and descended the mountain.The moment the little supreme leader Liu Zheng was done speaking, his people had already gathered over in succession. They escorted Cone Nail in groups and rushed towards the Goddess Peak.Wen Buzuo also gathered forward, he spoke to Cone Nail softly, “On the other hand, there is one more thing that is very queer, we have examined the corpses, we have verified the headcount, everybody else does not matter. However…Wen Shulin is gone! If he is alive, his person is not seen, if he is dead, his corpse is not found!”The three-inch nail Wen Bushuo gave a forced laugh as he shook his head, “It was only after we have noticed his disappearance that we have realized, we have not seen him for a long time…”Qin Zhui asked Cone Nail cautiously, “That white-robed man who rescued the others…could he be Wen Shulin?”Cone Nail clenched her teeth, she enunciated her words with pauses, “I! Do! Not! Know!”Cone Nail felt like crying right now, it was difficult to predict Wen Leyang’s life. The group of people was all suffering from severe injuries, yet problems arose one after another. Not only was there no clarification, the situation became even more complicated.At this moment, the ground suddenly shook gently, Cone Nail did not even need to think, she immediately called out to everybody else to run with all their might and rushed back to the Goddess Peak. They were very close to Mount Hua right now, if the magic formation were to lose its effect at this time, Cone Nail would really cry and curse the heaven.The large group of cultivators exerted all their strengths to urge their life vitality. They were akin to a flock of ducks that fled its coop as they dashed in a disordered manner. It did not take long before they rushed back to Mount Hua from the Desert Rebel Mountain. When they arrived on the Goddess Peak, they discovered in astonishment that the huge mountain was trembling not because the magic formation was about to lose its effect!Even the old demon rabbit, who spent his entire lifetime worshipping the Buddha and cultivated his energy, could not help but stomp his foot ferociously at this moment. He pointed to the wasteland that was exploding with dust as he scolded in rage, “It keeps coming and will never stop!”Red Pot also squalled out with a coo, “I made a wrong guess earlier! Run! Quick quick quick quick!”</p> </div> </div> <div class="row turn-page"> <a class="col-xs-2" href="/The%20Immortal’s%20Poison/265.html?v=1662298016466">Previous</a> <a class="col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:center;" href="/The%20Immortal’s%20Poison/book.html?v=1662298016464">Table</a> <a class="col-xs-2 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:right;" href="/The%20Immortal’s%20Poison/267.html?v=1662298016467"> Next</a> </div> <hr></div><hr><footer class="container"> <p>© Company 2014</p></footer><amp-lightbox id="searchLightbox" class="-il" layout="nodisplay" on="lightboxOpen:searchInput.focus; lightboxClose:searchTriggerOpen.focus" scrollable="" hidden="hidden"> <div> <div class="-ic" role="button" tabindex="0" on="tap:searchLightbox.close"></div> <div class="-ih"> <div class="-sg -sb" on="tap: searchLightbox.close, AMP.setState({ query: '' }), searchForm.clear" role="button" tabindex="0"> <div class="ap-a-ico -sw"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#close"></use> </svg> </div> </div> <div class="ap-o-search-field"> <form action="#" action-xhr="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/echo" class="-ip" id="searchForm" on="submit:AMP.setState({ query: throttledValue }),searchResult.focus" target="_top"> <amp-autocomplete class="-id" filter="substring" min-characters="1" on="select:AMP.setState({ query: event.value })" submit-on-enter="false" src="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/autosuggest"> <div class="ap-a-ico -im"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#search"></use> </svg> </div> <input id="searchInput" class="-iv" name="q" placeholder="What are you looking for?" on="input-throttled:AMP.setState({ throttledValue: event.value })" required=""> <button class="-ig" type="submit" name="search-submit" disabled="" [disabled]="!throttledValue">Search </button> <div role="listbox"></div> </amp-autocomplete> </form> <div class="empty" [class]="query ?
