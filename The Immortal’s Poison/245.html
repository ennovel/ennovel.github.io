</p><p>Editor:&nbsp;</p><p>EndlessFantasy TranslationThe whereabouts of Guo Huan’s split body has been found but it had been dissolved into the form of a vital fire which was then absorbed by Gou Mang’s seed. The split body has turned into a part of the devil’s fetus and it was no longer related to Guo Huan. The only trace left behind was his facial features which had remained on the human-faced bird monster. They had no choice but to admit that Guo Huan’s facial features were still handsome though it was unknown how would he look when the features were matched to his moon-shaped face.Guo Huan was still upset and displeased right now but he had lost his previous rage. He pointed at the soaring stone tower above the devil’s fetus and said, “This fetus has refined a devil’s appearance and the stone tower had been condensed from the vitality energy which was expelled from its body. It’s the direct opposite of the process which had refined the demon fetus.” The demon fetus was derived from the wood spirit’s monster which had taken form, even though it was granted the title of a demon, the process of refinement had involved the expulsion of malevolent energy from its body, this was the law of nature.The dog-headed eagle nodded from the side and chimed in, “Guo Huan’s split body was the mountain ghost’s stone monster while the devil fetus was of Wood Element. The vitality energy which had been expelled from its body was of stone disposition which was why it had formed into this stone tower here!”Xiaowu refused to listen to them as they continued to discuss ceaselessly, she then pointed at the devil’s fetus and asked in a childish voice, “How are we going to deal with this creature here now?” She waved the mourning staff in her hand as her little face filled with eagerness, “It has seized Guo Huan’s split body!”Chang Li and Zhui Zi surprisingly gazed into one another’s eyes in tacit agreement. They then started rubbing their fists and wiped their palms in preparation for a fight. The dog-headed eagle was stunned for a moment, surprised to see that the two beautiful demon immortals were about to attack the devil fetus.Guo Huan, on the other hand, shouted stiffly, “Wait!”Zhui Zi laughed, “You had saved my life anyhow in the Snowy Peak’s ore cave so I’m going to help to avenge you!”Chang Li laughed, “You’re not a bad person but you are too unfortunate. It’s a disgrace for you to become such an unfortunate demon! However, you’ve helped Tuo Xie’s disciples on multiple occasions so I will first repay the interest to your debt of gratitude!” Even though Chang Li may be stubborn, unyielding, and reckless in temperament, she has gradually become closer to Guo Hua recently so she had felt rather ashamed of herself for entrapping Guo Huan so savagely.The two beautiful women tossed Wen Leyang towards the stone tower. They then leaped up as their fragile-looking bodies abruptly erupted with burning demonic power, readying themselves before they pounced at the devil’s fetus.Guo Huan shouted loudly with a sonorous voice once again, “Wait, if all of you attack, I shall break my demon’s body to stop you!”Wen Leyang was completely stunned, he did not understand the situation at all. Judging by Chang Li and Zhui Zi’s statement, they had planned to help Guo Hua avenge the seizure of his split body but Guo Huan had then threatened them with his death. He was willing to sacrifice his soul in order to stop them from attacking.Xiaowu, who had been lying on Wen Leyang’s back all along, blinked her eyes when she saw this. It was apparent that she had not expected this as well.It was unknown whether Qian Ren was trying to advise Chang Li and Zhui Zi or if he was explaining the situation to Wen Leyang as he said, “This creature is not an ordinary demon that has been transformed from a spiritual beast but is the development of Gou Mang’s spiritual seed!” A sense of dread floated upon the dog-headed eagle’s face when he said that, “Whether it’s a deity or a devil and whether it condenses vitality or malevolent energy, it has already completed the incubation process and has taken form. It is now a rare creature which has been created from the energies of the heavens and earth, you will draw the wrath of the gods if you were to harm it!”Wen Leyang exclaimed in understanding and he was at a loss whether to cry or to laugh, “The act of killing the devil’s fetus won’t be considered as enforcing justice on behalf of the heavens but would incur the wrath of the gods instead?”The gigantic dog’s head swayed and bared its bright, terrifying fangs, “You cannot consider it as such, this is still the same as my previous saying; whether it is a deity or a devil, it is still the creation of the heavens! This is… This is…” Qian Ren’s tone of speaking sounded a little hesitant as if he was pondering on how to rephrase his words, “This is a partition that is similar to grading, you and I can cultivate until the utmost level. As long as we don’t possess the ability to ascend to the heavens as an immortal, we are just the same as plants and animals in the eyes of the heavens. However, this devil’s fetus is different. It has the immortal’s root and devil’s spell inherently so once it has taken the form of a spirit fetus, it is already part of the heavens unless it is killed by a similar type of deity or devil. However, if we were to attack it, we would be struck by the wrath of the gods.”This was the first time Wen Leyang has ever heard of such a concept, causing him to become absentminded all at once. He widened his eyes as he looked at demon immortals next to him before he turned to look at the devil’s fetus that appeared to be smiling happily.Chang Li clapped her hands and made an ‘I cannot be bothered’ gesture, “Even if we were to call down the wrath of the gods, it may not necessarily do any harm to me!” Zhui Zi too nodded in agreement. Her expression has returned to her previously piteous look.Guo Huan’s voice sounded stiff, “The two beautiful grandaunts are willing to avenge me, this old father can only wish for that. However… The demon cat will still need to meet the pickle jar first and the ice cone nail will still need to regain her memories and locate her enemy. Only when you’ve resolved those little matters of yours can you come and help to avenge me!” Guo Huan then laughed loudly, “In the future, all of you can come over here yourselves to avenge me, there’s no need to inform me and I won’t appreciate the kindness as well! Even if the heavens were to collapse now, all of you must first help me to find a replacement body before we discuss any further!”Chang Li turned her head to the side and peered at Zhui Zi, Zhui Zi hesitated for a moment before she finally relaxed her attack stance. A moment later, she felt that her action was a little less worthwhile and she pouted her lips as she said, “That was close! I had almost joined hands with the demon cat!”Chang Li laughed as she tilted her head mischievously, her expression was peculiar as she looked at Zhui Zi.Guo Huan’s split body has been fused into the devil’s fetus, the situation could not be corrected even with the descent of the Gold Immortal of Great Overarching Heavens to the mortal world. This so-called revenge was just to vent his anger, it was meaningless and would also draw in the wrath of the gods. Even though the devil’s fetus has already taken form, it was still eons away from the day it would break out of its cocoon and soar into the sky. It was not incisively connected to the people who had come to the pit, they should just mind their own business so that no one would cause delays for anyone else.Wen Leyang understood this principle. He would never allow Chang Li or Zhui Zi to flaunt this baseless morality of theirs. He was about to speak when he suddenly realized that Chang Li and Zhui Zi were gazing at one another more and more strenuously. One person’s face was smiling spuriously and was filled with stern murderous intent while the other person’s piteous gaze was as cold as ice. They look as if they would start fighting the very next second. Wen Leyang was startled and he did not hesitate before he jumped desperately between two demons.The two demons were engrossed in their confrontation and all four of their large eyes watched as Wen Leyang waved his limbs and glided past them. However, no one stretched out their hand to hold onto him…Wen Leyang was almost startled to death, this had been a serious miscalculation on his part. Zhui Zi and Chang Li’s persistence in fighting was stronger than their awareness to take care of Wen Leyang. If it had not been for his quick reaction to grab Zhui Zi’s calves in the midst of falling, he would have continued to plummet indefinitely into the depths of the earth…The dog-headed eagle was more conscientious in comparison as it had shut its eyes in time.Xiaowu had not joined Wen Leyang in his jump, she was lying on the last layer of the stone tower as she giggled in a childish and cute manner.Zhui Zi and Chang Li did not manage to fight this time and their gaze appeared a little disheartened. Zhui Zi bent over and pulled Wen Leyang up by his waist. She then frowned as she complained softly, “When are you going to learn how to fly?”Wen Leyang was in an awkward position and he was both amused and annoyed. He did not know what to say.Qian Ren laughed shyly as it attempted to mediate the situation, “There is no advantage for us to stay here any longer. I’m going to help Qin Zhui to refine the Ending Vine now, will the two fairy maiden please help to protect the magic…”Zhui Zi and Chang Li did not respond to the dog-headed eagle with a pleasant expression but they were both aware that Qin Zhui and Wen Leyang were very intimate friends. Even if Wen Leyang had not been present on the scene, they would never allow anything bad to happen to Qin Zhui. The both of them made a ‘do not worry’ gesture at the dog-headed eagle as their bodies floated onto the final layer of the stone tower.Wen Leyang, on the other hand, frowned as he stretched out his hand and pointed at the devil’s fetus which was in a deep slumber. Zhui Zi understood his intention and she answered before he could speak, “Though the devil’s fetus has already taken form, it has yet to open the pathway to its divine wisdom so it cannot think or move. As long as we don’t provoke it, it won’t retaliate so it’s alright to refine the Ending Vine next to its body.”Guo Huan continued Zhui Zi’s topic of conversation, “I’ve told you in the past, the wood elemental magic art pays particular attention to set down roots in the earth. The vine is not a mortal item and had accompanied the spiritual seed for an unknown amount of years. If Qian Ren were to bring it up to the surface and refine it, the power upon refinement will certainly be much weaker than refining it here!”Wen Leyang was nodding when he suddenly recalled something and he leaped up with a scraping sound and pointed at the human-faced phoenix with excitement in his face, “This creature here has taken form but is without intelligence now, Guo Huan, can’t you bore into…”Before he could finish his sentence, he was interrupted by Chang Li’s laughter from the side, “The fetus of a deity or a devil is not something that Guo Huan’s primordial spirit is capable of digesting. Let alone the fact that he had been a mountain ghost but he was only left with a remnant soul now. Even when his demonic primordial energy was at the height of its prime, he would be incapable of controlling this devil’s fetus. If he was unfortunate then he would directly be refined by the bird’s evil primordial energy, if he was fortunate then he could become like Qian Ren in the monkey. He could only watch helplessly as the devil’s fetus broke out of the cocoon and ascended to the heavens after millennia of cultivation. He would be like a parasite in the host’s body and can only watch helplessly as the host showed off!”Chang Li had given a long-winded explanation but Guo Huan only said three words, “Stop messing around!”The dog-headed eagle did not understand why it had been brought up in the topic of conversation once again and it pouted its lips helplessly as it flapped its wings at Chang Li and Zhui Zi, “Thank you for the two immortals’ help!” Following that, it opened its enormous mouth abruptly and gulped down Qin Zhui who had been wrapped in the Ending Vine like a mummy.In Qian Ren’s perception, after the dung beetles had been removed from the dog-headed eagle, it was both a flesh armor and a body. It was also like a void which was similar to a sealed protective circle. The dog-headed eagle has the final say within the three-acre land inside its body. It was already troublesome enough that it was separated by the monkey layer and then the dog-headed eagle layer. There was utterly no way for Qian Ren to cast his wood elemental magic art. Moreover, the dog-headed eagle was too enormous and it does not have arms and legs. Therefore, for the delicate task of helping Qin Zhui to refine the treasured weapon, there was no way Qian Ren could do it through the dog-headed eagle’s body.From the aspect of safety, magic casting, or agility, Qian Ren could only know more after the dog-headed eagle had swallowed Qin Zhui into its stomach.Even though he understood the principle, Wen Leyang could not help but feel a chill all over his body when he witnessed the dog-headed eagle’s fangs open and close around Qin Zhui’s body.After the dog-headed eagle had swallowed Qin Zhui, it then floated next to devil’s fetus in the green-tinted void as it slowly closed its eyes. After only a few seconds, Qian Ren unexpectedly exclaimed in a hoarse and muffled voice and soon after that, the dog-headed eagle abruptly opened its gigantic eyes. Its initially light-yellow pupils have turned redder and more tyrannical than the color of blood!Guo Huan exclaimed in dismay and shouted in surprise, “Something bad has happened!”Chang Li spoke to Zhui Zi, “You stay behind, I shall go and take a look!” Her body then moved as fast as lightning as she pounced onto the dog-headed eagle’s gigantic mouth. Her delicate hands exerted their strength abruptly and forcefully opened that gigantic mouth which was many times bigger than her. Soon after that, her body flashed past as she entered the dog-headed eagle’s body.Before they excavated the devil’s fetus, the stone tower had been spreading its demon seed all along. With Wen Leyang and Xiaowu’s level of cultivation base, they would certainly be caught off guard. Even though the stone tower has already quieted down at this moment, either Chang Li or Zhui Zi would still need to stay behind and look after them. If the two demon witches were to dive into the dog-headed eagle together, by the time they finished rescuing Qin Zhui and Chang Li, perhaps Wen Leyang and Xiaowu would have turned into a big and a small Christmas tree.Wen Leyang was shocked by the sudden turn of events and he pulled Zhui Zi as he pointed at the dog-headed eagle, “Let’s go in together!”Zhui Zi shook her head and her usually fearful tone of speaking has turned resolute and decisive, “No, if there’s something going on in there, all of you would become a burden!” Just as Zhui Zi finished speaking, Chang Li had reappeared in a flash. She then shouted in a sharp and raging voice as layers upon layers of demon blades rose like a swarm of bees next to her. With the scraping sound of a sharp howl, the blades pinned the dog-headed eagle’s mouth down and slashed down ferociously!While Wen Leyang and the others were still confused, Chang Li grunted and the demon blades which had covered the sky in a shockingly massive wave suddenly scattered about messily. It was as if an invisible rope had suddenly wrapped itself around the blades and was about to crush them.Zhui Zi seems to understand the situation and though she still remained by Wen Leyang’s side, her hands were now pinched into the magic conjuration gesture. Streaks upon streaks of ice spikes then appeared out of thin air and converged with Chang Li’s demon blades into one before blasting ferociously towards the void in front of the dog-headed eagle like a mighty storm.Guo Huan was much more experienced than Wen Leyang who was still confused on the side. He pondered and understood the crucial part of the situation at this moment as he asked Zhui Zi in astonishment, “The Ending Vine… The devil’s fetus too…”A layer of sharpness has enshrouded Zhui Zi’s face soundlessly. She was summoning the ice spikes in a swifter and more forceful manner as she nodded, “The monkey has miscalculated this time!”Wen Leyang’s face was filled with concern, “What happened?”“The Ending Vine had been subdued by the devil’s fetus since earlier!” Guo Huan answered him rigidly.That strand of spirit thread which had extended from beneath the devil fetus’s neck has erupted into thousands and millions of strands afar. Each spirit thread was connected to a flower, grass, and tree’s root system so that it could absorb the spirit primordial energy of the world. However, no one realized that there was also a strand of fine thread on the devil fetus’ chest which was so fine that it could not be detected by telegnosis ability. This strand had been firmly connected to the Ending Vine.With the four old demons’ skills, they had only managed to guess that the devil’s fetus had drawn support from the grass and trees to absorb and circulate the essence of the heavens and earth. It also absorbed the tyrannical malevolence in it to be transformed into the devil’s disposition while it simultaneously expelled the vitality and stone disposition from Guo Huan’s split body and condensed it into the stone tower.The Gou Mang’s spiritual seed was a wood elemental spiritual creature. If it was to ascend into the heavens as an immortal in the future, it would become a tree deity. However, if it was to turn into a devil, it would become a vine monster! Regardless of whether it had grown into the immortal’s root or the devil’s spell in the end, it was still a wood elemental deity.The Ending Vine was a treasured weapon that Qian Ren has successfully refined more than halfway and was filled with wood elemental spirit primordial energy. With such a great source of nourishment nearby, how could the Gou Mang’s seed let this opportunity slip so easily? This was not a difficult guess but because the strand of spirit thread which was being used by the devil’s fetus to refine the Ending Vine had been utterly undetectable by their telegnosis ability and everybody else’s focus had been attracted by that puff of spirit thread which connected every single blade of the grass and plant on Mount Hua, they had merely regarded the Ending Vine and Gou Mang’s seed as the creatures of the same genus.Raging roars which were filled with heart-rending agony echoed louder and louder from the depths of the dog-headed eagle’s body. Its enormous body then started to quiver vigorously as its steely feathers stiffened in layers. It no longer appeared awe-inspiring but now resembles a crow which had been drenched by the early winter’s rain.The previously transparent strand of spirit thread connecting the Ending Vine to the devil’s fetus gradually turned into a pale green color and slowly floated into Wen Leyang’s line of sight.The jade knife Guo Huan was anxious that he could not help and he continued to explain to Wen Leyang, “The wood elemental spiritual power in the Ending Vine had been refined by the devil’s fetus and that vine is currently the devil fetus’s feeler!”Only Chang Li had witnessed the monkey’s current tragic appearance. The Ending Vine had seized the opportunity as Qian Ren was preparing to cast his magic spell to help Qin Zhui refine his treasured weapon. It had suddenly attacked and its pointy tip was like a crazed blood-sucking leech that bored into the monkey’s ear in an abrupt yet soundless manner!Qian Ren was the embodiment of exquisite wood elemental spiritual vitality. Even though he had not been able to completely utilize his power as he was trapped in the body of a monkey, for the devil’s fetus, the monkey was like a coconut filled with sweet and sinful juice under its thick shell. Meanwhile, the Ending Vine… Was the devil fetus’s drinking straw.The Ending Vine was still coiled around Qin Zhui as its tip bored into the monkey’s ear.The monkey had been using his hands to claw and tear at the vine desperately yet his effort was futile against the vine which had already pierced into his body and begun to absorb his wood elemental life vitality.As the boundless wood elemental spiritual vitality coursed through that strand of indistinguishable spirit thread and flowed into the devil’s fetus from the monkey’s body like an endless stream, the spirit thread too started to bloom in a faint and ghastly green color!Even though Guo Huan could not see the situation which was happening in the dog-headed eagle’s body, his prediction had been almost completely accurate. The only thing he had been unable to guess for certain was if the vine had bored in through the monkey’s ear, nose, mouth, or navel. He finally spoke up dully, “If he can’t rip off that strand of spirit thread, the monkey would be in great trouble this time!”Wen Leyang could not stand if anything bad were to happen to the monkey but he was even more concerned about his ugly friend, “What about Qin Zhui, Qin Zhui is…”Guo Huan gave a forced laugh, “That person is certainly still alive, though Qian Ren and Chang Li had lapsed in their judgment this time, they would never neglect Qin Zhui’s life!”Qin Zhui had been reforged with a wood elemental foundation so he was now a scrumptious meal for the devil’s fetus from his primordial spirit to his body. His situation of being entangled in the Ending Vine was utterly unlike that which had been described by Qian Ren as being from the same source. Instead, it was more like the devil’s fetus was trying to refine him. However, Qin Zhui was a cultivator as well and he was also fairly wise. It would not be a difficult task for the devil’s fetus to kill him but in order to completely digest and absorb his entire person, it was a task that would take years and years of work.Wen Leyang howled in rage and the Ning Jiao’s Bone Snake appeared with a loud bang. It roared as it surged alongside Zhui Zi’s summoned ice spikes towards that strand of spirit thread… Halfway through its path, the Ning Jiao was suddenly frozen into a giant lump of ice and fell downwards stiffly…It was unknown why the dog-headed eagle’s body has abruptly erupted with the dazzling color of fire like a divine bird which was cast out of molten metal. Its sharp brightness made it hard for one to look at it closely! Meanwhile, Qian Ren’s agonized howl has become even louder. Each howl was like a Pipa which had suddenly broken a string; it sounded abrupt, savage, and sonorous!Wen Leyang was both anxious and furious. He could not figure out how the devil fetus’s power of spiritual vitality, which was slightly weaker than Zhui Zi, Chang Li, and the others, could still withstand the continuous blasts from the shocking supernatural powers summoned by the two demon immortals. Its fine thread still remained indomitable and there was no sign of it breaking at all. Whether it was Chang Li’s demon blades or Zhui Zi’s ice spikes, the moment their supernatural power came into contact with the green-colored spirit thread, it would disperse with a loud bang in a flash. Any other domineering forces would also disappear into nothingness!Guo Huan was still the experienced one after all and he was much calmer now. Of course, there was no other purpose for him other than to remain calm. Though he could sacrifice himself by casting the demon body breaking spell for the sake of the dog-headed eagle, the treasured weapon of Yin’s Error and Yang’s Mistake would not necessarily succeed at crushing the spirit thread with one blast, “Both strands of spirit threads are the devil fetus’s root systems!”Though the devil fetus’s evil primordial energy was not as remarkable as the two demon immortals on the scene, the body which had been incubated from the Gou Mang’s seed still contained the essence of the heavens and earth. Its root system would be even more well-seasoned!Wen Leyang was jumping in rage on the stone tower while Chang Li was even more furious. She could only watch helplessly as her demon blades which could chop open a huge mountain were completely ineffective against the spirit thread. Not only was the spirit thread still safe and sound, it was growing greener as well. She shrieked in rage as her frail-looking body erupted with a gush of boiling and surging demon power all of sudden. She then pounced in rage towards the spirit thread.This was the first time that Wen Leyang has ever seen Chang Li become so angry. The air in front of her body surged in turbulence like a wave before parting around her vigorously. Zhui Zi gasped softly and she was worried that she would accidentally injure her companion so she hastily retracted her ice spikes. A moment later, she reacted to the situation and realized that the person she was afraid of injuring was actually Chang Li and stomped her foot regretfully.Chang Li was supposed to be a demon cat but as she was pouncing towards the prey, she has lost her usual agility and grace. Accompanied by loud booming sounds, there were only two words left which could be used to describe her – violently ferocious!Wen Leyang has never seen her that way before yet Guo Huan had never seen any less of that in the past. He made clicking sounds yet he was unable to utter a word.When he had been pursuing Chang Li with the three sword immortals of the Black and White Island two thousand years ago, each time the demon cat had been cornered, she would turn around and pounce towards them like this. That action of hers stunned and forced the four top master cultivators to stop their approach.At that moment, Chang Li has already reached the spirit thread like a gust of strong wind. She then grabbed the spirit thread ferociously with her two hands before she opened her charming mouth and bit into it ferociously!Wen Leyang, Xiaowu, Zhui Zi, and Guo Huan were all well-experienced fighters. However, when they witnessed Chang Li’s action, all of them yelled in surprise. Even Qian Ren who was in deep distress could not help but cry out with a monkey’s howl…The yelling continued until Chang Li’s raging curse put a stop to the matter. After Chang Li had bit the spirit thread, it was as if she had triggered a tremendous force. Her fragile-looking body was lifted ferociously as bright red blood gushed from her initially charming and delicate lips. Her bloodied appearance made the demon cat look so enticing that she could take one’s breath away with her ferocious demonic madness!This divine fetus was a devil’s creature and its roots system has been refined from the essence of the heavens and earth. When Chang Li had bit the spirit thread, not only was she unable to break it, she had injured her mouth instead.Zhui Zi, whose face was filled with pity but her eyes were filled with mirth, asked Chang Li, “Are you in pain? Are you in pain!”Chang Li spat out a mouthful of bloody saliva and answered uncourteously, “It hurts more than being crushed!”Though Chang Li had failed to break the spirit thread, she seems to have caused the devil fetus to feel some pain. The human-faced phoenix which had been sleeping soundly suddenly shuddered as the corners of its mouth twitched in agony. Chang Li laughed out loud and was about to grab the spirit thread to bite it again when a muffled sound erupted from the devil fetus’s body. The thirteen long feathers which were covering the devil fetus’s body swayed and rose as gently and softly as a willow towards Chang Li’s figure.Zhui Zi’s eyes widened suddenly and she leaped forward with a howl. She was accompanied by her ice spikes as she surged towards the long feathers which appeared deceptively harmless.The long feathers were silent as they moved slower than a dandelion seed which was floating down in a windless sky. However, it was this slow speed that managed to slash the green-tinged glow into pieces! In the midst of his absentmindedness, Wen Leyang could only feel as if the scene before his eyes had turned into a shattered mirror. His line of sight was being shattered and dispersed…A sense of astonishment flashed past Chang Li’s face as well. She forgot about biting as she summoned her supernatural power once again and converged her powers with Zhui Zi.The ice spikes, demon blades, and graceful figures were bursting with a ruthlessness that pierced Wen Leyang’s eyes and rippled with boundless demon power. The thirteen long feathers which had floated slowly shuttled past the supernatural powers which were all over the sky in a relaxed manner. Suddenly, those feathers sped up like a poisonous snake which had been threatened and had bared its fatal fangs in the blink of an eye as it slashed towards Zhui Zi and Chang Li.Chang Li and Zhui Zi’s face carried a bitter coldness as their bodies twisted and turned as they evaded and fought valiantly against the long feathers. Like the spirit thread, the long feathers were so firm and tenacious that there was almost no way they could be harmed by magic, supernatural powers or any other power. The two beautiful demon immortals have the upper hand but they were helpless in the face of the long feathers all at once. As they became entangled by the devil fetus’s sudden attack, they were too preoccupied to deal with the spirit thread which was glowing greener and greener with time.Xiaowu was startled by the violent battle before her eyes and she was anxious as her hands gripped her mourning staff tightly, “Chang Li has awakened the demon monster with her bite…”She was halfway through her speech when she was interrupted by Guo Huan, “The devil fetus has yet to awaken! It will never awaken before it has taken form!”The human-faced phoenix’s expression has turned ghastly and furious but its eyes were still tightly shut.“That strand of spirit thread is about to lose it efficacy soon, that was why the thirteen long feathers have started to move now. The devil fetus does not even possess spiritual intelligence so this is its inherent ability.” Guo Huan then paused for a moment, “Sooner or later, even without Chang Li’s bite and when they have blasted at it for a little while longer, the devil fetus would still use its feathers to retaliate against them.”This was a battle that Wen Leyang could not understand. The level of power involved was so immense while the attacks and defenses were equally horrifying. The two parties were fighting for only one reason – to rip off the spirit thread before Qian Ren was drained or Qian Ren would be drained before his companions can manage to rip off the spirit thread (Author’s note: Hah-hah, what a profound sentence this is)!The dog-headed eagle was considered as a good comrade and Qin Zhui had made a solemn promise that Qian Ren was his intimate friend who was constantly prepared to help him to win Nineteen over. Zhui Zi has faced life and death situations with Wen Leyang on the highland and their relationship has become closer recently, needless to say about Chang Li as well. Wen Leyang calmed himself down. As his relatives and close friends were trapped in the devil fetus’ threat, he was willing to stop pondering calmly but he wished he could transform into a deity or devil just to attack wildly!Guo Huan understood Wen Leyang too well, he could predict what Wen Leyang was about to do just by looking at him as he ground his teeth and stiffened his body. He then hastily shouted, “Quick, take the jade knife and pass it to Xiaowu…”Before his voice could die away, the dog-headed eagle suddenly let out a heart-rending and painful scream! It was not Qian Ren’s voice but the dog-headed eagle’s agonized scream which pierced through the heavens and earth!The was a light thud as the jade knife was tossed onto the stone tower. Wen Leyang was like an agile cheetah and his sleeves flapped loudly as his entire being pounced towards the fragile-looking and fine spirit thread which had remained tenacious all along!</p> </div> </div> <div class="row turn-page"> <a class="col-xs-2" href="/The%20Immortal’s%20Poison/244.html?v=1662298014870">Previous</a> <a class="col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:center;" href="/The%20Immortal’s%20Poison/book.html?v=1662298014869">Table</a> <a class="col-xs-2 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:right;" href="/The%20Immortal’s%20Poison/246.html?v=1662298014871"> Next</a> </div> <hr></div><hr><footer class="container"> <p>© Company 2014</p></footer><amp-lightbox id="searchLightbox" class="-il" layout="nodisplay" on="lightboxOpen:searchInput.focus; lightboxClose:searchTriggerOpen.focus" scrollable="" hidden="hidden"> <div> <div class="-ic" role="button" tabindex="0" on="tap:searchLightbox.close"></div> <div class="-ih"> <div class="-sg -sb" on="tap: searchLightbox.close, AMP.setState({ query: '' }), searchForm.clear" role="button" tabindex="0"> <div class="ap-a-ico -sw"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#close"></use> </svg> </div> </div> <div class="ap-o-search-field"> <form action="#" action-xhr="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/echo" class="-ip" id="searchForm" on="submit:AMP.setState({ query: throttledValue }),searchResult.focus" target="_top"> <amp-autocomplete class="-id" filter="substring" min-characters="1" on="select:AMP.setState({ query: event.value })" submit-on-enter="false" src="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/autosuggest"> <div class="ap-a-ico -im"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#search"></use> </svg> </div> <input id="searchInput" class="-iv" name="q" placeholder="What are you looking for?" on="input-throttled:AMP.setState({ throttledValue: event.value })" required=""> <button class="-ig" type="submit" name="search-submit" disabled="" [disabled]="!throttledValue">Search </button> <div role="listbox"></div> </amp-autocomplete> </form> <div class="empty" [class]="query ?
