<br> 
<br> No man who has not himself endured it can understand the agony to a man of Captain Protheroe's disposition, of acknowledged helplessness. For he was essentially a man of action, strong, capable, alert for every danger, with a ready wit to cope with every obstacle that rose in his path. He had never yet learned the meaning of failure. And now, when life at last offered him the full cup of his desire; when but four bare walls stood between him and a freedom so rich that beside it his past life seemed but an empty waste; now when his whole being clamoured for action, he could do nothing but sit helpless and inactive, while the hours slipped slowly away and the day drew near when the woman he loved must suffer shame and torture with none to support or comfort her. He knew it was useless to struggle against his fate, but his whole soul cried out against submission. Yet he could do nothing, nothing, but sit rigid, silent, his hands locked together in the fierce misery of impotent revolt.
<br> 
<br> Suddenly he stirred, every sense on the alert and listening intently. At the farther end of the shed his fellow prisoners lay silent, their sleeping forms dimly visible in the faint light. Close beside him, where a pile of bales and sacks was heaped against the wall of the shed, he seemed to detect the noise of a key turned gently in a rusty lock, followed by the creak of an unused hinge. He waited with bated breath for what should follow. After a pause the hinge creaked again.
<br> 
<br> Half incredulous, he crept forward to investigate the cause of the unmistakable sounds, and began noiselessly to remove the sacks from that portion of the wall which they concealed. Two he moved easily, but the third resisted his efforts. In vain he pulled, exerting his strength in an obstinate determination to have his way. As he became dimly conscious that the resistance was rather active than passive, it suddenly ceased, and he stumbled backwards, with the sack in his arms.
<br> 
<br> Like the full moon on an Autumn evening the fiery head and rosy countenance of Master Robert Wilcox rose slowly into view above the top of the piled bales, and peered cautiously into the shed.
<br> 
<br> For a moment the two stood staring at one another doubtfully. But as Master Robert slowly perceived the captain's uniform, his jaw dropped, and a look of horror and consternation crept into his face.
<br> 
<br> "Good Lord!" he gasped, and with a sudden swift movement, his head disappeared from view.
<br> 
<br> But Captain Protheroe was no whit behind him in rapidity of thought or action. Quick as lightning his arm darted over the sacks, and he grasped firmly the tousled hair of the intruder.
<br> 
<br> "Hist, you fool!" he whispered. "All's well. I'm one of the prisoners myself. Is it a rescue?"
<br> 
<br> Slowly the face reappeared and stared doubtfully at the speaker, then having subjected him to a critical survey, and being at length assured by the captain's tone and bearing of his good faith, Master Wilcox heaved a sigh of relief, and rubbed the sweat from his forehead.
<br> 
<br> "Phew! What an escape," he muttered. "I made sure you were one of those damned sentries. Yes, 'tis a rescue, but not for you," he continued curtly.
<br> 
<br> "Nevertheless, my friend, I purpose to be one of your party," answered Captain Protheroe coolly, "I and a lady who is here with me."
<br> 
<br> "A lady; what lady is she?"
<br> 
<br> "What is that to thee?"
<br> 
<br> "Nought, only 'tis a lady I am here to aid; Mistress Barbara Winslow."
<br> 
<br> "What! Even so? Why, well met, friend. 'Tis even she of whom I spake. She is sleeping yonder. I will go bring her and we can slip out quietly without rousing the others."
<br> 
<br> Robert eyed him half-doubtfully.
<br> 
<br> "Be speedy then. Every minute is danger, for I know not when the sentries will be round."
<br> 
<br> "True, there's no time to lose."
<br> 
<br> The two had carried on their conversation in whispers; the other inmates of the shed were undisturbed.
<br> 
<br> Captain Protheroe now went swiftly to Barbara's side. She was sleeping quietly, her cheek pillowed on her hands. He aroused her gently.
<br> 
<br> "What is it?" she gasped, in sleepy bewilderment.
<br> 
<br> "Freedom," he whispered, smiling down at her.
<br> 
<br> Silently they stole back across the shed, and soon the three stood side by side in the narrow alley outside.
<br> 
<br> "Come!" cried Rob, seizing Barbara's arm eagerly. "There's not a moment to lose. Come!"
<br> 
<br> But Barbara was now thoroughly awake. She drew back quickly.
<br> 
<br> "But the others!" she exclaimed. "Surely you will not leave them behind. They are to die to-morrow."
<br> 
<br> Captain Protheroe shook his head.
<br> 
<br> "Mistress Barbara, the risk is too great."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, but that is rank cowardice," she exclaimed angrily. "You may do as you choose, sir, I shall——"
<br> 
<br> He laid a restraining hand upon her arm.
<br> 
<br> "Captain Protheroe," she exclaimed indignantly, eyeing him haughtily.
<br> 
<br> He smiled at her serenely.
<br> 
<br> "Yield to reason, Mistress Barbara. You cannot go back."
<br> 
<br> Barbara turned away angrily, and addressed herself to Rob.
<br> 
<br> "Cannot you go back?" she asked.
<br> 
<br> "Not I, madame," was the ready answer. "You are not safe yet."
<br> 
<br> Barbara sighed, looked at the pair of them contemptuously, and yielded to necessity.
<br> 
<br> "But you can leave the door open," she urged.
<br> 
<br> Rob hesitated.
<br> 
<br> "'Twill be a clue," he muttered, but yielded to her plea. "Now, come, madame, we must wait no longer."
<br> 
<br> "Where are you going?" she demanded quickly.
<br> 
<br> "To Master Lane's house," he answered impatiently. "Lady Cicely is there, and——"
<br> 
<br> But Barbara shook her head obstinately.
<br> 
<br> "No," she said, "I will not bring trouble upon them. They are loyal folk, and were I discovered there, 'twould bring misfortune to all. Did Master Lane send you to me?"
<br> 
<br> "No, madame, he knows nought of the venture as yet, but——"
<br> 
<br> "Then, indeed, I will not go. I will not endanger them, and Cicely. 'Twould be most cruel."
<br> 
<br> Rob groaned in desperation.
<br> 
<br> "Lord! These women!" he muttered. "Nay, madame, trust in me and come at once. We may be discovered any moment."
<br> 
<br> Barbara turned to Captain Protheroe.
<br> 
<br> "Whither are you going, sir?" she asked abruptly.
<br> 
<br> "I' faith, I cannot say," he answered doubtfully. "But for you, madame, it were certainly wiser to follow this gentleman, if he can bestow you safely."
<br> 
<br> "I will not," she answered resolutely.
<br> 
<br> "We'll all swing for it, an we bide here parleying much longer," began Rob desperately.
<br> 
<br> He broke off abruptly, for even as he spoke, a window in the wall opposite was flung open, and a man's face peered out into the alley.
<br> 
<br> Instinctively the three drew back into the shadow. But it was too late. The disturbed burgess had seen the three figures, and in an instant he suspected the truth of the situation.
<br> 
<br> With an exclamation his head disappeared from view, and a moment later they heard the bolts of a door round the corner of the building shot back and the man rushed into the street shouting:
<br> 
<br> "The prisoners are escaping! Look to your prisoners."
<br> 
<br> Captain Protheroe seized Barbara's hand, and they began to run rapidly down the alley. They heard the sentinels running up the street and shouting. They darted round the corner as their pursuers turned into the alley.
<br> 
<br> Rob had disappeared.
<br> 
<br> The alley led into a wider street, parallel to that in which the sentries had been posted, at the main entrance to the shed. Down this the fugitives turned, but were met by a knot of men running towards the shouts. Captain Protheroe tightened his grip on Barbara's hand, desperately, and ran straight towards them, waving his free arm in the direction of the prison.
<br> 
<br> "The prisoners!" he shouted. "They are escaping, look to them."
<br> 
<br> The ruse succeeded. The men hesitated a moment, staring doubtfully at his uniform, and then proceeded at a run towards the prison, shouting confusedly. On they ran right into the arms of the sentries, who at that moment turned out of the alley.
<br> 
<br> A few moments of confusion ensued ere the identity of each party was made clear to the other—moments precious to the fugitives, who ran on blindly from street to street, little heeding which way they went.
<br> 
<br> Barbara stumbled as she ran, and her breath came in sobs. Captain Protheroe's grip upon her wrist was like a vice. Again they turned a corner, and for an instant they stopped dead; for halfway down the street, full in their path, the bright light from an open doorway flared across the road, and in the light stood a group of soldiers eager and alert. They had run into a trap.
<br> 
<br> Their pursuers behind shouted a warning, the troopers in front wheeled round quickly to face them.
<br> 
<br> To go back was impossible, to stand still, madness, to run forward into the arms of these expectant troopers, a desperate chance. This time no ruse could avail them.
<br> 
<br> And then, a few yards on the near side of the lighted doorway, Captain Protheroe espied a dark opening in the line of buildings. He darted towards it and slipped between the black shadows of the houses.
<br> 
<br> Barbara was spent, but even as they ran into the narrow alley, and as he felt further effort was hopeless, Captain Protheroe noted an open doorway, dimly lighted. It was a desperate chance, his only one. With an effort he dragged Barbara into the house, and shut the door behind him, listening intently, while the girl sank exhausted at his feet. He heard their pursuers turn the corner, pass the door unheeded, and running eagerly on, turn again into the street beyond. Their shouts and footsteps died away in the distance, and all was still.
<br> 
<br> Captain Protheroe turned and surveyed his surroundings. They were in a narrow, dimly-lighted passage, flanked by a doorway on either side, and leading to a third door at the end. The door on the left was open, and the room to which it gave access, a small parlour, was deserted.
<br> 
<br> He glanced at Barbara. She raised her head and smiled at him bravely, though her breath still came in shuddering gasps, and her face was white and drawn.
<br> 
<br> He stooped down, and helped her to her feet, then leading her into the little parlour, laid her, unresisting, on the settle, and closed the door.
<br> 
<br> "Where are we?" she whispered, looking wonderingly around her.
<br> 
<br> He shook his head.
<br> 
<br> Just then a door was heard to open in some distant part of the house. There was a babble of sounds, a shrill voice singing through the verse of a song, followed by a loud burst of boisterous laughter.
<br> 
<br> Captain Protheroe, with a quick exclamation, crossed to the window of the room, drew aside the heavy curtain, and peered out.
<br> 
<br> Then he turned with a strange expression in his eyes.
<br> 
<br> "We have walked into the lion's den, Mistress Barbara," he said. "This is the White Hart Inn."
<br> 
<br> Barbara started to her feet.
<br> 
<br> "Oh! let us go, let us go instantly," she cried.
<br> 
<br> Captain Protheroe stood irresolute.
<br> 
<br> "I don't know," he said slowly; "it may be we are in the safest place. At least 'tis the last place where they would dream of searching for us."
<br> 
<br> As he spoke, the door at the end of the passage opened, and they heard a dragging footstep slowly approaching.
<br> 
<br> Barbara clasped her hands in desperation.
<br> 
<br> "Lie down!" he whispered sharply. "Lie down, and turn away your face."
<br> 
<br> The footsteps drew nearer, the door was pushed open, and a girl carrying a dim rushlight entered the room. Her dress was untidy, her hair tousled, her eyes heavy with sleep.
<br> 
<br> She gave a quick cry at sight of the occupants of the room, and almost dropped her candlestick in her surprise.
<br> 
<br> "Why, Sue, what ails you?" Captain Protheroe asked cheerily.
<br> 
<br> The girl stared at him in bewilderment.
<br> 
<br> "La, Captain Protheroe, sir, eh! but ye frighted me. I took thee for a ghost. What ever be thee here for? Why," she continued with dawning recollection, "I heard tell as how thee wert took prisoner, and in gaol along wi' rebels."
<br> 
<br> "Arrested, I! What nonsense," he answered coolly; "'twas but a jest of Colonel Kirke's. They don't arrest the king's officers, Sue, my girl. But look you, this lady hath but just recovered from a swoon. There was a disturbance in the streets, and she was thrown down and frightened. I brought her in here to recover, before I take her home."
<br> 
<br> "Eh, poor thing!" exclaimed Sue, eyeing Barbara pitifully. "The street is no place for the like o' her this time o' night. But you're kindly welcome, sir, and the lady too. We could not give her a bed, sir, I'm afraid; but an she wish to rest on mine——"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, there's no need to put yourself about, she will be well enow shortly."
<br> 
<br> "Would you be wishing for supper, sir?" asked in girl sleepily.
<br> 
<br> "Supper! Good heavens, no. Why it must be near midnight. I'm for my bed presently, and methinks 'tis the place for you now. You look tired to death, my girl."
<br> 
<br> "Aye. I've been about since five o'clock this morning," she answered, yawning. "Their lordships make a deal of work. But I'm going to my bed now, if you want no more, sir."
<br> 
<br> "Nothing, thank you, Sue."
<br> 
<br> "I'm sleeping in yonder," nodding her head across the passage. "Perhaps you'd call, sir, if you want anything." Then she added, hesitating, "We be so full o' guests now, father sleeps on the settle here. But he'll hardly be down yet, he must see their lordships safe to bed first. Good-night to you, sir."
<br> 
<br> She crossed the passage and disappeared through the doorway opposite.
<br> 
<br> Captain Protheroe broke the silence which followed:
<br> 
<br> "If you are rested," he said briskly, "I think we had best be gone."
<br> 
<br> "Must we go?" she asked lazily.
<br> 
<br> "The sooner we are free from the houses, the better. The landlord may come here any moment. They are quieter above stairs already."
<br> 
<br> Then he glanced across the room.
<br> 
<br> Through the half-closed doors of a cupboard in the corner he espied some dishes of meat—cold bacon, a half eaten pasty, several loaves of bread.
<br> 
<br> "Fugitives cannot be over and above honest," he muttered with a laugh, as he swept the contents of the cupboard into a cloth, and tucked the bundle under his arm. "We can make the loss good to mine host, some day, perchance, and food we must have. Now, Mistress Barbara, if you are ready."
<br> 
<br> He stopped with a look of consternation, for even as he spoke, the passage door again opened, and they heard a man's voice calling aloud:
<br> 
<br> "This way, Master Peters, we can transact our business somewhat more privately here."
<br> 
<br> The only possible hiding place the room afforded was the space between the high-backed settle and the wall. In an instant the two had stepped back into its shadow, and crouched there, scarce daring to breathe, hoping only that the dim uncertain light might conceal their presence from the two men who a moment later entered the room.
<br> 
<br> The first was a big, burly farmer, with round, red, solemn face and somewhat wooden cast of countenance. He took up his stand by the table, facing the settle, but with the light between him and the fugitives.
<br> 
<br> His companion afforded a marked contrast; a small, thin, wiry, sharp-featured man. His pale face was alight with intellect, but his narrow-set blue eyes were hard as steel, and while seeming to pierce a man's inner-most thoughts, yet gave in return no vestige of answering confidence. He was soberly suited in black, and carried in his hand an open letter, and a small bag of gold.
<br> 
<br> This was no other than Master Stephen Jewars, my Lord Jeffrey's clerk and secretary, one in whom it was commonly averred his lordship trusted more nearly and confided more honestly than in any other living man.
<br> 
<br> The secretary, laying the letter open upon the table, turned and faced the farmer.
<br> 
<br> "You are after your time, Master Peters," he began, "I had expected you yestere'en."
<br> 
<br> "Aye, aye," answered the farmer slowly. "I were in Taunton then, sure enow, but the mare were took bad and I could not leave her."
<br> 
<br> "Hum," answered the other somewhat sharply. "You should recollect, Master Peters, time is precious."
<br> 
<br> "Aye, your honour," answered the farmer imperturbably. "But so is hosses."
<br> 
<br> The secretary started angrily, and eyed the solemn face of his companion doubtfully. Then satisfied by his scrutiny, his lip curled slightly, and he proceeded:
<br> 
<br> "Well, well, now you are here, I need not detain you. I see by this letter that you successfully carried out your undertaking."
<br> 
<br> "Aye, aye, sure enough. I took Master Ferguson to——"
<br> 
<br> "Master Peters," interrupted the other sharply, "you will do well to remember this is a matter requiring much circumspection. We will, therefore, have no names, if you please."
<br> 
<br> "Why, there be none here to hearken," answered the farmer, in aggrieved surprise.
<br> 
<br> "There is a saying that walls have ears. You cannot be too careful."
<br> 
<br> "As your honour pleases," answered the man with a shrug. "I took the man, you know who, safe to Lime right under the noses of the troopers, he lying hid in my cart. He bided three nights in my house, and then I shipped him to France wi' my wife's cousin."
<br> 
<br> "'Twas well done, Master Peters, and here is the price for your task."
<br> 
<br> The secretary handed the man the bag of money, and watched him secrete it in his belt. Then he laid his hand on the farmer's arm, and eyeing him steadily with those piercing blue eyes, addressed him in a slow impressive tone.
<br> 
<br> "And now, Master Peters, there remains but one thing to say to you; a warning. You will remember that this matter is an affair of state, and he who has had aught to do with such affairs does well to keep his eyes blinded, his ears deaf, and above all, his tongue dumb. If by word of yours, spoken be it in anger, in boasting, or in drink—if ever, I say, word of this matter escape you, you will——"
<br> 
<br> "I'm paid to be quiet; I'm not a man to babble i' other folk's affairs," interrupted the farmer in an aggrieved tone.
<br> 
<br> "I knew it, otherwise you had not been chosen for the work. Nevertheless, bear my words in mind. The man I serve is all-powerful. He can reward generously, but he never forgets an injury, and he never forgives a foe. Good-night, Master Peters, and remember to bear yourself discreetly."
<br> 
<br> The secretary let the man out through the door leading into the alley. He returned to the room muttering to himself.
<br> 
<br> "I doubt the fellow must be disposed of, he knows too much," he said slowly. Then he picked up the letter from the table, and stood for some minutes gazing at it abstractedly, lost in thought.
<br> 
<br> "Fool! Fool!" he muttered at last. "Madman, to put himself in the power of such a man. Of a surety it must work his ruin in the end. And all to no purpose, since the papers are still lost. And yet, what is't to me? For an he rise, I shall rise with him, and if he fall—his carcase must serve as a stepping-stone, whereby I may rise alone."
<br> 
<br> Thoughtfully he folded the letter, and placed it in his pouch, then turned again from the room. They heard him go slowly down the passage, a door closed, and all was still once more.
<br> 
<br> The fugitives emerged cautiously from their hiding-place.
<br> 
<br> "Ferguson! Ferguson!" muttered Captain Protheroe to himself, as he wrapped his cloak round his companion's shoulders. "Ferguson and Jeffreys! for assuredly 'twas Jeffreys of whom he spoke. Now, what the devil—— But come, Mistress Barbara, we'll away from here, and leave them to brew what plots they will."
<br> 
<br> Barbara pulled the cloak closely round her, and followed him silently out of the house. He walked quickly down the alley, and turned into the silent street behind the inn. The moon was down, and save for the occasional glimmer of a lamp, the streets were in darkness.
<br> 
<br> "Where are we going?" asked Barbara, wonderingly.
<br> 
<br> He shrugged his shoulders.
<br> 
<br> "We must get clear of the town, first. You will not go to your cousin?" he asked doubtfully.
<br> 
<br> "No, indeed! I would not risk danger to Cicely. And besides I know not where lies the house."
<br> 
<br> "Then we throw in our lots together?" he asked, smiling down on her.
<br> 
<br> "Indeed, sir, I see not what else remains for me," she answered simply, committing herself to his protection with an implicit faith.
<br> 
<br> Under his breath he prayed Heaven he might be the means of saving her.
<br> 
<br> The streets were very silent, they passed on unheeded, avoiding the watch by careful detours. Of their former pursuers they heard nothing; and, indeed, these latter had given up the chase in despair.
<br> 
<br> As for Robert, with the quick wit of one well versed in such adventures, experience culled from many encounters with the watch, when his two companions set off down the alley he had scrambled without more ado through the very window whence the alarm was first given, and biding there quietly till the pursuit had passed, he escaped thence as silently as he had entered, and made the best speed he could back home.
<br> 
<br> So none hindered the fugitives in their progress, and they hurried on, with hope ever dawning more brightly before them.
<br> 
<br> Suddenly a man reeled out of a cross-street, and ran straight into Barbara's arms. He started back with a drunken curse, stared stupidly down at her, and then passed on.
<br> 
<br> But when he had gone a few paces he paused irresolutely, looked back over his shoulder, and then turning, ran unsteadily after them and seized the girl's arm.
<br> 
<br> "Mistress," he said in a hoarse whisper, "I saw thee in court to-day."
<br> 
<br> Barbara gave a cry of horror and shrank back, Captain Protheroe clenched his fists, and glanced cautiously up and down the quiet street.
<br> 
<br> But the man laughed drunkenly.
<br> 
<br> "Bah!" he cried, "I'll not betray you, my beauty. 'Tis too pretty a face to lie hid in prison, and kissing, not scourging, were meeter for thee. Aye, and so I'd tell my Lord Jeffreys himself. I'll not betray thee. But get you from the town. Taunton streets are not for you. That bonny face is not soon forgotten, my angel."
<br> 
<br> Captain Protheroe scowled. His fingers itched to be at the man's throat, for though the warning was kindly, the tone was insolent, and the fellow leered at the girl with his bleared eyes. But a disturbance was not to be risked. With a curt nod, and a gently murmured word of thanks from Barbara, they hurried on, leaving the belated traveller leaning up against a wall chuckling over their hasty retreat.
<br> 
<br> But their progress was doomed, nevertheless, to meet with yet another check that night.
<br> 
<br> They had turned into a quiet street, on the outskirts of the town, when they were aware of three men coming towards them, carrying amongst them a ladder. Captain Protheroe drew Barbara into the shade of a doorway, and they waited for the party to pass. They stopped, however, before a small house, and laid their burden on the ground; then lighting a small lantern they stooped over the bundle on the ladder, and busied themselves over it for some minutes with muttered curses and ejaculations. There was a silence and a mystery about their proceedings that excited the captain's curiosity, and he craned forward eagerly to watch them.
<br> 
<br> Presently they rose and rearing the ladder against the house, held it there, while the leader of the three, an old man, small and hunchbacked, clambered up and entered the half-opened casement of a chamber in the upper story. He disappeared for a moment into the room, then returning to the window, proceeded to haul up the bundle by a rope to which it had been fastened.
<br> 
<br> With a sudden quick movement Captain Protheroe put his hand across Barbara's eyes, that she might not watch them, for he recognised in a moment the thing they were hauling up so eagerly, he understood too well the meaning of that dangling shadow on the wall. A hanged man was a common enough sight in those days, but what meant these silent men, with that helpless body here?
<br> 
<br> The man in the chamber hauled up the corpse, until the helpless, drooping head was on a level with the window ledge. He secured it there, descended the ladder, and stepped into the middle of the road chuckling and rubbing his hands, to see the effect of his handiwork.
<br> 
<br> His accomplices stared at him curiously.
<br> 
<br> "Well, master," growled one, "there he hangs for sure, and we're well paid for the job. But what a murrain a man wants wi' a hanged corpse dangling outside his chamber, is more than my wits can tell."
<br> 
<br> The hunchback turned slowly and faced the speaker, and his face was as the face of a madman.
<br> 
<br> "Harkee, my man," he said grimly. "The wench sleeping in yonder chamber is my niece, was my niece, for she's none o' mine now. She was a devil with her whims and tantrums, but for all that, she should have wedded my son, for she hath a pretty fortune of her own. But she would none of him, calling him 'fool' and 'dotard' because, forsooth, he is not so quick in his wits as some. And he my son. But I kept her close, and she should have gone my way in time, when Monmouth's army came to town, and with him this cursed fellow. They met, I scarce knew how, and she drew him on with her devil's eyes. But I kept her close, so I deemed, till at length I learned the fellow had been in secret night after night to visit the girl, thus, by her chamber window. Then we waited for him, I and my son, and fell on him in her room. But he worsted us, two to one though we were, and my son a giant in strength; and he slew my son. He slew my son, and she laughed when she saw him lying dead before her. And he my son. Her lover fled by the window, and I saw him no more. After the battle I sought him high and low until I found him. I brought him to his trial, and saw him hanged for a rogue. But she has heard nought of him as yet. Presently will we rouse her, and see how now she greets this lover of hers."
<br> 
<br> The man told his story in a cold, even tone, and at the end broke into a sudden savage chuckle; the light from the lantern illumined his face, and his companions shuddered at the sheer brutality of its expression.
<br> 
<br> But the two eavesdroppers who had heard the story, horror-struck, could endure no more, indeed, Barbara was trembling from head to foot. With one accord they crept from the doorway, fortunately unobserved by the three men, who stood so intently contemplating the horrible spectacle before them, and passed rapidly from the spot, horrified by the experience, and ever pursued by a wild unreasoning terror lest the sleeping girl should wake and come to the window, lest they should hear the greeting she gave her lover's corpse.
<br> 
<br> And so at length they left the town behind them, and reached the quiet country beyond.
<br> 
<br> The night lay dark and silent around them. The pure fresh wind blew on their faces, bearing the sweet scent of the woods upon its wings; the trees and hedges shadowed darkly above them, whispering soft answers to the wooing breeze. The air was full of the sweet mysterious noises of the night, when nature murmurs, in those voices which know neither sound nor language, yet speak so clearly to the listening heart.
<br> 
<br> The wide arch of the clear heavens stretched above them, spreading before their gaze the infinite glories of their star-lit space, teaching alike the infinite littleness and the infinite greatness of man; since though he comprehend so little of what lies around him, yet hath he in his being the breath of that spirit who "or ever the earth and the world was made, is God from everlasting, and shalt be, world without end."
<br> 
<br> The joy of freedom coursed through their veins, a great peace enfolded their hearts, and the Spirit of God rested upon them as they walked on in silence, side by side, into the darkness of the night.
<br> 
<br> At length, when they had walked three miles or more, Captain Protheroe stopped and stooping down carefully scanned his companion's face.
<br> 
<br> "We will go no further now," was the result of his scrutiny. "I fear me we must dispense with a roof for to-night at least. Can you endure a night in the open, think you?" he queried doubtfully.
<br> 
<br> Barbara smiled, stretching her arms out towards the sky.
<br> 
<br> "Indeed I can. Three nights in prison have wrought such effect upon me, I could wish never to behold a roof again."
<br> 
<br> "Good! then follow me. I know of a hiding-place that should shelter us safely for many a day."
<br> 
<br> He turned abruptly from the road, and helping her through the bordering hedge, struck across several rough fields, until a dark shadow of a wood loomed before them, and in a few minutes more they were enveloped in the blackness of its depths.
<br> 
<br> "Give me your hand," he said, drawing her nearer to him. "The paths are difficult to follow."
<br> 
<br> Indeed she could distinguish nothing in the intense darkness, but he walked on unerringly, leading her along a maze of narrow paths, bordered by thick brushwood, and a tangle of undergrowth.
<br> 
<br> "I played here as a lad," he said in explanation of his ready pilotage. "There is no better way to learn the lie of a country than to roam it as a boy. I verily believe I could go every step of the way with my eyes shut."
<br> 
<br> Presently he stopped, and turning, looked at her doubtfully.
<br> 
<br> "We should leave the path here, madame, but I fear 'tis a difficult passage, and scarce fit for you to traverse. Think you——"
<br> 
<br> Barbara laughed.
<br> 
<br> "Fear nothing for me. Be sure, sir, a woman can go through most things if she ardently desire to come out at the further end."
<br> 
<br> So they turned from the path, and plunged into the tangle of brushwood. Despite her boast, Barbara found the difficulties of the way far greater than she had expected, for the darkness was so deep she could distinguish little of what lay around her, and the briars and thorns caught her skirts at every step. Captain Protheroe went before to part the branches for her, where it was possible, or to help her to scramble over the tangle of bushes that barred their way. In spite of her fatigue the girl's spirits had quite recovered their customary buoyancy, and as they struggled forward, she climbing and scrambling, he pulling her on, she shook with laughter.
<br> 
<br> At length, after ten minutes' tedious struggle, their way was barred by a network of branches and creepers so tightly enlaced that the barricade was clearly not due to nature alone. Captain Protheroe after a few paces to the left, paused, and pushing aside a branch which yielded to his efforts with but slight resistance, he stepped through the opening, and their journey was at an end.
<br> 
<br> Barbara found herself in a small clearing, a sloping hollow in the ground, enclosed by a ring of trees and a network of branches. The ground was thickly carpeted with moss, she felt the spring of it beneath her feet; the faint sound of running water announced the near neighbourhood of a spring; far overhead, through the thick interlacing leaves she could see the stars.
<br> 
<br> "This is our camp," said Captain Protheroe, glancing round with a proprietary air of old acquaintanceship. "'Twill be nigh twenty years since my cousins and I first made it. We were Oxenham's men then, an I remember rightly," he continued with a smile, "fighting against the Spaniards in the Neck of Panama. My father had read us the history, and we built our camp according to the fashion therein described. By the look of it, one would say that none had been here since. The forest stretches far, and 'tis an unfrequented place. 'Twill shelter us well for to-night at least, and then we can lay our plans. And now, madame, you must rest."
<br> 
<br> He turned to one corner of the clearing, where the moss grew thick and soft, and pulling down some branches, together with long fronds of bracken, he built a rough bower to shelter her from the cool breeze, and give her at least a thought of privacy. Then he spread his cloak upon the ground, and rolled the wide cape over a pile of leaves and grass to form a rough pillow.
<br> 
<br> He eyed his handiwork with an air of dissatisfaction.
<br> 
<br> "'Tis a poor place," he muttered; "but I can do no more to-night."
<br> 
<br> Barbara crossed to his side; she looked up at him with a sudden smile, but her eyes were soft and dark with unshed tears.
<br> 
<br> "For this, for a thousand kindnesses, Captain Protheroe, I must remain forever in your debt."
<br> 
<br> She held out her hand; he stooped low before her, and pressed it to his lips.
<br> 
<br> "Madame, I am amply rewarded."
<br> 
<br> So he answered her, and had she met the look in his eyes she had known that his words were true.
<br> 
<br> Long after Barbara's tired eyes had closed in sleep, Captain Protheroe lay silent, motionless, lost in thought.
<br> 
<br> Twelve hours ago he had held rank in the royal army, rich in wealth, in power, in all the prosperity and happiness of a favoured officer. Now he was an outcast from his profession, an exile from his home, a rebel over whose head hung the penalty of death.
<br> 
<br> Yet he did not blame his fate. For there, beside him, an outlaw as he, helpless save for his protection, was the one woman in the world who throughout his life had awakened the worship of his nature, and though the star of his fortunes hung low and dim on the horizon, yet before him, in the darkness gleamed the rising star of love.
<br> 
<br> Yes, he was amply repaid.
<br> 
<br> So these two rested peacefully in the shade of the sheltering leaves, while behind them in Taunton, Prudence and Robert tossed sleepless, in a consternation of wonder and doubt, and Cicely, to whom Prue had confided the whole story, prayed desperately the night through in an agony of newly awakened hope.
