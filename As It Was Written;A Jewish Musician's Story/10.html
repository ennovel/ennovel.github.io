All day Sunday a legion of blue devils were my comrades. Late Monday afternoon I received by the post a letter and a package, each addressed to “E. Lexow, in care of D. Merivale, Esq.” The penmanship was the same on both—a stiff European hand which I could not recognize. I began with the letter. It read thus:—
<br> 
<br> “Mr. E. Lexow,
<br> 
<br> “Dear Sir:
<br> 
<br> “I should have forwarded this to you before, but not apprised of the alteration of your name, I was unable to discover your address. I dispatch this to the address indicated by Dr. Rodolph, who informs me that you are to be reached through D. Merivale, Esquire, as he is not advised of your private residence. I found it in a pawnbroking establishment (No.—————-street, kept by one M. Arkush) now more than a year, and purchased it with the intention of restoring it to you, because I suppose that it must be of some value to you as a family memento, and that you would not have disposed of it except needing money. Hoping that this letter may find you in the enjoyment of good health, I am
<br> 
<br> “Respectfully yours,
<br> 
<br> “B. Tikulski.”
<br> 
<br> What could Tikulski’s letter mean? What could “it” be? I puzzled over these questions for a long while before it occurred to me to unseal the package.
<br> 
<br> There was an outer wrapper of stout brown paper. Beneath this, an inner wrapper of tissue paper. Both removed, I beheld an oval case of red leather, considerably the worse for wear. What did it contain? I pressed the clasp and raised the lid. It contained a miniature painted on ivory, the likeness of a man. The faded colors and the old-fashioned collar and cravat showed that it dated from some years back. But of whom was it a picture?
<br> 
<br> Why had Tikulski posted it to me? And what did he mean by supposing that I should value it as a family memento and that I would not have parted with it—I, who had never owned it,—“except needing money?” I was thoroughly mystified.
<br> 
<br> “Merivale,” I said, “can you make any thing out of this?”
<br> 
<br> I tossed him the letter and the portrait.
<br> 
<br> Presently he muttered, “Pretty good, by Jove.”
<br> 
<br> “Well?” I questioned.
<br> 
<br> “Well, what?” he returned.
<br> 
<br> “Well, what do you make of it? What does it mean?”
<br> 
<br> “Why, that the likeness is striking, what else? Your father, eh?”
<br> 
<br> “My father? I confess I am in the dark.”
<br> 
<br> “And you have the faculty of dragging me in after you. What are you trying to get at?”
<br> 
<br> “I am trying to get at Mr. Tikulski’s idea. Why should he send me that miniature? Whom does it represent?”
<br> 
<br> “You don’t mean to say that you haven’t recognized it?”
<br> 
<br> “Most certainly I do.”
<br> 
<br> “Man alive, look in the glass.—Here.” Merivale held up the miniature in one hand and a pocket-mirror in the other. As closely as it is possible for one human countenance to resemble another, the face of the picture resembled my reflection in the glass.
<br> 
<br> “Are you satisfied?” demanded Merivale.—“Why, what ails you?” he continued presently, as I did not answer. “You look as if you had seen a ghost. Are you ill?”
<br> 
<br> “It has caused me quite a turn,” I replied. “It must indeed be a portrait of my father. But do you know—wait—let me tell you something.”
<br> 
<br> What I told Merivale I shall have also to tell the reader.
<br> 
<br> I could remember neither of my parents. As a child, I had lived in a dark old house with a good old rabbi and his wife—Dr. and Mrs. Hirsch. I had never stopped to ask whether or not they were my father and mother until I was eleven or twelve years of age. Then, the question having been suggested by a schoolmate, I had said, “Dr. Lesser”—Lesser being the rabbi’s given name—“are you my father?” To which the doctor, beaming at me over the rim of his spectacles, had responded, “No, my child: you are an orphan.”—“An orphan? That means?” I pursued. “That your papa and mamma are dead,” said he.—“Have they been dead long?” I asked indifferently. “Ever since you were the tiniest little tot,” he replied. And thereupon, as the subject did not prove especially interesting, I had let it drop.
<br> 
<br> Time went on. I was perfectly contented. The doctor and his wife were kindness personified. The present occupied me so pleasantly that I forgot to be curious about the past. But at length, when I was fifteen, the question of my parentage was again brought to my mind—this time by a lad with whom I had had a quarrel and who as a parting thrust had inquired significantly whether I knew the definition of the Hebrew noun Mamzer. Highly incensed, I ran home and burst into the doctor’s study. “Doctor,” I demanded, without ceremony, “am I a Mamzer?”—“What a notion! Of course you are not,” replied the rabbi.—“Then,” I continued, “what am I? Tell me all about my father and mother.”
<br> 
<br> The doctor said there was nothing to tell except that my mother had died when I was less than two years old, and my father not a great while after her. They had been members of his (the doctor’s) congregation; and rather than see me sent to an orphan asylum, he and his wife had taken me to live with them.—“But what sort of people were they, my parents?” I insisted. “Give me some particulars about them.”—“They were very respectable, and by their neighbors generally esteemed well off. Your father had been a merchant; but for the last year his health was such as to confine him to his bedroom. It was quite a surprise to every body to find on his death that very little property was left. That little was gobbled up by his creditors. So that you have no legacy to expect except——”
<br> 
<br> “Except?” I queried as the doctor hesitated. “There is no exception. You have no legacy to expect at all.”—“But,” I resumed, “had my parents no relations? Have I no uncles or aunts? Am I altogether without kindred?”—“So far as I know, you are.”
<br> 
<br> Your father came originally from Breslau. It is possible that he had relatives there; but he had none in this country—at least I never heard him speak of any. He was a good man, a pious man. It was sad that he should die so young, but it was the will of Adonai—“And my mother, had she no brother or sister?”—“About your mother I can tell you very little. She came from Savannah. Whether she has connections there still, I can not say.”—“Doctor,” I asked, after a moment’s silence, “what did you mean by that ‘except’ you used a while ago, speaking of legacies?”
<br> 
<br> “I meant nothing. I was thinking of a few family relics, papers and what-not, which you are to receive when you become of age.”—“Why not till then?”—“No reason, save that such was your father’s wish, expressed on his death-bed. He said, ‘Don’t let my son have these until he is grown to be a man.’.—“Can you tell me definitely what they are?”—“I can not. I have never seen them. They are locked up in a box; and the box I am not at liberty to open.”—“Doctor, what was my mother’s maiden-name?”
<br> 
<br> “Bertha, Bertha Lexow.”—“Did you marry her and my father?”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, no; they were married in the South at Savannah. I think they had been married about five years when your father died.”—I went on quizzing the doctor until he declined to answer another question. “Go away, gad-fly,” he cried. “You are worse than the inquisition.”
<br> 
<br> In my eighteenth year the doctor died suddenly, having survived his wife by a six-month only. He was stricken down by paralysis while intoning the Kadesh song in the synagogue. In him I lost my only friend. I had loved him precisely as though he had been my father. His death was an immense affliction. It took me a long while to gather my wits together and realize my position.
<br> 
<br> A week or two after the funeral a man came to me and said, “I represent the Public Administrator, charged with settling up Dr. Hirsch’s concerns. He leaves nothing except household furniture and a few dollars in bank—all of which goes to his next-of-kin in Germany. You will have to find other quarters. These are to be vacated and the goods sold at auction in a few days.”—“Ah,” I said, “if you are his administrator, that reminds me. I beg that you will deliver over the things the doctor had belonging to me—a box containing papers.”
<br> 
<br> “Identify your property and prove your title,” he replied.
<br> 
<br> Strangers came and went in and out of the house for several days. But in the inventory which they prepared no such box as the doctor had described was mentioned. Furthermore, a thorough search failed to bring it to light. The auction was held. The last fork was knocked down to the highest bidder. And I had to go about my business with the unpleasant conviction that owing to some slip-up somewhere my inheritance had either been lost or stolen. Gradually I reconciled myself to this idea, concluding that what I already knew about my parents was the most I ever should know; and thus matters had remained ever since.
<br> 
<br> “But now,” I added, my recital wound up, “now perhaps in this miniature I have a clew. It must be a portrait of my father: and very likely it was part of the contents of that box. I suppose, if I were clever, I should see a way of following it up.”
<br> 
<br> “I am consoled,” said Merivale, drawing a deep breath.
<br> 
<br> “Consoled?” I queried.
<br> 
<br> “Yes, consoled for my obstinacy in making you play at the concert. You see, it was an inspiration after all. If you had not chanced upon Tikulski—what a blood-curdling name! fit for a tragedy villain—if you hadn’t chanced upon him as you did, why you never would have received the picture, and so the mystery which envelops my hero s antecedents would never have been dispelled. Now we must go to work in a systematic way.
<br> 
<br> “Exactly; but how begin?”
<br> 
<br> “Let me see Tikulski’s letter again.”—After he had read the letter, “Begin, he said, by paying a visit to the pawn-shop where he got it. Luckily he had the presence of mind to mention its whereabouts.”
<br> 
<br> “Good,” I assented. “But will you go with me?”
<br> 
<br> “Do you imagine I would allow you to go alone, you unfledged gosling? I shall not only go with you, but by your permission I shall manage the whole transaction. I fancy I surpass you in respect of savoir faire.”
<br> 
<br> “It is now past four. Shall we start at once?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, of course.”
<br> 
<br> “Don’t be too hopeful,” he warned me, as we approached the pawnbroker’s door. “Most likely we shall run against a dead wall.”
<br> 
<br> The shop was empty. A bell tinkled as we opened the door. In response, a young fellow in his shirt-sleeves emerged from a dark back room.
<br> 
<br> “Is Mr. Arkush in?” demanded Merivale, with an air of friendliness.
<br> 
<br> “Do you want to see him personally?” returned the young man, not over politely.
<br> 
<br> “You have fathomed my purpose,” said Merivale with mock gravity.
<br> 
<br> “What about?”
<br> 
<br> Merivale drew near to the young man and shielding his mouth with his hand whispered, “Business,” accompanying his utterance with a knowing glance.
<br> 
<br> “Well, you can see me about business,” rejoined his interlocutor, surlily.
<br> 
<br> “Impossible. Here, take my card to Mr. Arkush and say I am pressed.”
<br> 
<br> “Mr. Arkush can’t see nobody. He’s sick.
<br> 
<br> “Sick? Ah, indeed?” cried Merivale. “Has he been sick long? I hope it is nothing serious. Pray tell me what the trouble is?”
<br> 
<br> The young man looked surprised. “Oh, it’s only rheumatism,” he said. “You ain’t a friend of his, are you?”
<br> 
<br> “Why, my dear fellow, of course I am. By the very nature of his profession Mr. Arkush is the friend of every body; and I am the friend of every friend of mine. Consequently but the deduction is too obvious. Here, take him my card and say that if he is not too ill I shall hope to be admitted.’
<br> 
<br> “Well, perhaps I’d better,” said the young man, reflectively.—“Becky,” he called, raising his voice.
<br> 
<br> Becky appeared.
<br> 
<br> “Good-afternoon, Miss Rebecca,” said Merivale, lifting his hat.
<br> 
<br> “Mind the shop,” said the young man to Becky, and thereat vanished.
<br> 
<br> “Come this way,” he said to us, presently returning.
<br> 
<br> He conducted us into the cavernous back room. The atmosphere was heavy with the scent of stale cookery. The walls were lined with shelves, bearing mysterious parcels done up in paper winding-sheets. Under a grimy window at the further end an old man sat in an easy chair, a patch-work quilt infolding his legs. Bald, beardless, with sharply accentuated features and a yellow skin, he looked like a Midas whose magic was beginning to operate upon himself.
<br> 
<br> “Dear me!” cried Merivale, advancing toward him. “I’m shocked to find you suffering like this, Mr. Arkush. Do the legs give you much pain? You must try petroleum liniment. I’ll send you a bottle. They say it’s the best remedy in the world.—But tell me, how are you getting on? Do you notice any improvement?”
<br> 
<br> The old man’s face wore a puzzled expression. “What was the business you wanted to see me about?” he inquired.
<br> 
<br> “Oh, never mind about business till you have quieted my anxiety regarding your health. Besides, are you sure you will be able to attend?”
<br> 
<br> The mask of Midas betrayed a tendency to smile. “Come, time is money; hurry up,” said its owner. He had a strong Jewish accent, thus: “Dime iss money.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, well,” said Merivale, “if you don’t think it will disturb you, I’ll come to the point. But let me disarm beforehand any suspicion which the nature of my errand may be calculated to inspire. I am not a detective. I am not on the track of stolen goods. I am simply a private individual desirous of gaining certain information for certain strictly legitimate ends. So you need have no fear of compromising yourself by speaking with entire unreserve. Shall I proceed?”
<br> 
<br> “My Gott, what are you talking about? Don’t make foolishness any longer,” exclaimed Mr. Arkush with some degree of vivacity.
<br> 
<br> “Mr. Arkush,” said Merivale in his most solemn tones, “do you remember this?” extracting the miniature from his pocket and handing it to the pawnbroker.
<br> 
<br> The latter donned a pair of spectacles and holding the picture off at arm’s length, scrutinized it in silence.
<br> 
<br> “Yes, I remember it,” he replied finally, “I sold it to a gentleman some time ago. What of it?”
<br> 
<br> “You did. You sold it about a year ago to a gentleman with a white beard. Recollect?”
<br> 
<br> “Ah, yes, yes: you are right. He had a white beard. He was also a Jew. We spoke in Judisch. I remember.”
<br> 
<br> “By Jove, hasn’t Mr. Arkusha wonderful memory?” cried Merivale, turning to me.
<br> 
<br> “I happen to remember,” volunteered Mr. Arkush, unperturbed by the compliment, “because when I put that article into the window I said to myself, ‘You won’t get no customer for that. What good is it to anyone? You made a mistake to lend your money on it. That was a loss.’ But the very same day the old gentleman came in and bought it, which was a surprise.”
<br> 
<br> “Ah, I see. Could you tell me, Mr. Arkush, of whom you got it originally—who pledged it with you?”
<br> 
<br> “Du lieber Gott! how should I remember that? It was two years ago already.”
<br> 
<br> “True, but—but your books would show.”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, my books would show the name the person gave.”
<br> 
<br> “Well, will you kindly refer to your books?”
<br> 
<br> “Ach, you make me much trouble!—Yakub,” he called.
<br> 
<br> The young man came.
<br> 
<br> Arkush told Yakub to get him the ledger for 18—. It was a ponderous and dingy volume. Yakub held it open while his employer turned the pages, running his finger from the top to the bottom of each. At length the finger reached a stand-still. Mr. Arkush said, “Yes, I have found it. It was pawned with me by a man calling himself Joseph White.”
<br> 
<br> “The date?”
<br> 
<br> “The 16th January.”
<br> 
<br> “Have you any means of recalling what sort of looking individual Joseph White was? And, by the way, is his residence given?”
<br> 
<br> “‘Residence, Harlem,’ it says. That’s all. How should I remember his looks?”
<br> 
<br> “Of course—you see so many people in the course of a year, it is not wonderful that you should forget.—But tell me, did White put any thing else in pawn that day?”
<br> 
<br> “No, sir; nothing else.”
<br> 
<br> “He simply pawned this one article and went away; that’s all?”
<br> 
<br> “That’s all.”
<br> 
<br> “Hum!”
<br> 
<br> Merivale reflected. At length he resumed. “But at any other time—that is, does White’s name appear on your ledger under any other date?”
<br> 
<br> “Do you expect me to read through the book?” inquired Arkush, with the tone of protestation. “That is too much.”
<br> 
<br> “I’m awfully sorry to annoy you, but this information I am seeking is of such great importance—you understand—it’s worth a consideration.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, well, that’s different,” said Arkush. “What will you give?”
<br> 
<br> “I’ll give twenty-five cents for each month that you go over—is it enough?”
<br> 
<br> “Here, Yakub,” cried Arkush. “Run back from January 16th, and see if you find the name of Joseph White again.”
<br> 
<br> Yakub carried the ledger to a desk hard by, and began his task.
<br> 
<br> “Do you smoke?” Merivale asked the old man, offering him a cigar. Presently the air became blue with aromatic vapor.
<br> 
<br> “Here you are!” called Yakub from his stool. He proceeded to read aloud, “‘December 7th—one onyx seal ring—amount, one dollar and a quarter—to Joseph White—residence, Leonard street—ticket-number, 15,672. Same date—one ornamented wooden box—amount, fifteen cents—to Joseph White—residence, as above—ticket-number, 15,67.’.rdquo;
<br> 
<br> “Keep still,” said Merivale in an aside, as he saw my lips open. “I’ll do the talking.—I’m infinitely obliged to you, Mr. Arkush. Now, if I may trespass just a little further upon your indulgence, can you tell me whether you still have either of those articles in stock? If so, I should be glad to see them—with a view to purchasing, of course.”
<br> 
<br> “Look, Yakub,” said Arkush. “Was those goods redeemed?”
<br> 
<br> Yakub returned the ledger to the shelf whence he had taken it, and produced another book of similar proportions in its stead. Presently he said, “Number 15,672, sold August 20, 18—; Number 15,673—see profit and loss.”
<br> 
<br> “Number 15,672 was the ring, was it not?” asked Merivale. “Number 15,673 is referred to the account of profit and loss—will you kindly turn to it under that head, Mr. Yakub?”
<br> 
<br> Yakub possessed himself of a third volume, and in due time read, “‘Number 15,673—July, 18—, given to R.—Amount of loss, fifteen cents.’.rdquo;
<br> 
<br> “Let me see that entry,” said Arkush.
<br> 
<br> After he had scrutinized it, “Oh yes,” he continued, “I recollect. White was a colored man. I recollect all about it. That ring and that box were the first things he brought here; that picture was the last. I happen to recollect because I gave that box to my daughter, Rebecca, instead of offering it for sale.”
<br> 
<br> “Ah,” said Merivale, “then I suppose Miss Rebecca has it still. Could she be persuaded to show it to us?”
<br> 
<br> “I don’t know. I will ask her.”
<br> 
<br> He sent Yakub into the front room with instructions for Rebecca to present herself.
<br> 
<br> On her arrival, they held a brief conference together in Judisch. Then Rebecca went away, and Arkush said to us, “Yes, she has got it yet. She has gone to fetch it.”
<br> 
<br> During her absence Merivale resumed, “You are quite sure that it is useless to go further back in your books—that the name of White doesn’t occur in any other place?”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, yes; I am sure. I recollect perfectly. He was a colored man. He only came twice.”
<br> 
<br> “I notice that on one occasion his address is given as Harlem, on another as Leonard street. How is that?”
<br> 
<br> “How do I know? Maybe he moved. Maybe neither address was his true one. These people very often give false names and addresses.”
<br> 
<br> “I suppose they do,” Merivale assented, and thereafter held his peace, chewing his nether lip as his habit was when engrossed in thought.
<br> 
<br> For my part I could not see that we had made much progress. I was beginning to get impatient.
<br> 
<br> Becky reappeared, bearing the box.
<br> 
<br> The box was about ten inches square by four or five in depth. It was empty. Merivale did not allow me to examine it. “Wait,” he said, as I reached out my hand to take it.
<br> 
<br> “Would you mind very much parting with this box, Miss Arkush?” he asked, fixing a pair of languishing eyes upon Rebecca’s face.
<br> 
<br> “What will you give me for it?” the business-like young lady inquired.
<br> 
<br> “What will you accept?”
<br> 
<br> “What’s it worth, father?”
<br> 
<br> “That box is worth two dollars any how,” replied the shameless old usurer, regardless of the fact that we knew to a mill what he had paid for it.
<br> 
<br> “Then certainly this will be enough,” said Merivale, and he slipped a five-dollar gold piece into Rebecca’s palm. Then he settled with Arkush, bestowed a gratuity upon Yakub, and bidding an affable good-by to every body, led me out through the shop into the street.
<br> 
<br> “Well,” I said, “we have run against the dead wall that you foresaw.”
<br> 
<br> “So it appears,” said he.
<br> 
<br> “The picture was pawned by a colored man only two years ago—that is, four-and-twenty years after my father’s death. We don’t know of any means by which to reach that colored man; but even if we did—”
<br> 
<br> “It would be a forlorn hope.”
<br> 
<br> “Exactly. So that we stand just as we did before we left home, do we not? Except that you are by five dollars a poorer man. It was sheer extravagance, your purchasing that box. I suppose your imagination connected it with the box—the box that Dr. Hirsch told me of. But the probabilities are overwhelmingly against that contingency. Then, why did you waste your money, buying it? Intrinsically, it isn’t worth carrying away.”
<br> 
<br> “Hush, hush,” interposed my friend. “Don’t talk to me. I have an idea—an idea for a story—脿propos of Arkush and his daughter. Bless me with silence until I have meditated it to my soul’s satisfaction.”
<br> 
<br> At home he began, “Yes, as you have said, our interview with Arkush was not fruitful. We have simply learned the name—or the assumed name—of the last owner of your father’s picture—for, that it is your father’s picture I have no sort of doubt. The next step would logically be to find Mr. White and question him. It is possible that a tempting advertisement in the newspaper might fetch him; but it is not probable. Very likely, he would never see it. Very likely, he is a thief, and even if he did see it, would be restrained by caution from replying to it. So that the outlook is not hopeful. As for this box being the box—why, the hypothesis is absurd. It was not on that supposition that I bought it. And even if it were the box, it would be of little consequence, empty as it is. I trust you are not too much disappointed.”
<br> 
<br> “By no means. I have managed to live for a considerable number of years in my present state of ignorance about my vanished legacy, and doubtless I shall pull through a few years more. Only, of course I was bound to follow the clew that this picture seemed to furnish, as far as it would lead; and having done so I am contented. I was not very hopeful when we started out, wherefore I am not very disappointed at the result. Let’s think no more about it.”
<br> 
<br> “Good! Your mind is imbued with a sound philosophy. But now—”
<br> 
<br> “But now, tell me why in the name of common sense you invested five dollars in that box?”
<br> 
<br> “Precisely what I was driving at. Now you are going to have a practical illustration of the value of experience.”
<br> 
<br> He took the box up from the table where he had laid it.
<br> 
<br> “You think that ‘intrinsically, this wasn’t worth carrying away,’ and that my expenditure of half an eagle was a reckless waste of good material. To an inexperienced observer your view would certainly seem the correct one. The box is scarcely beautiful. The wood is oak. The metal with which its surface is so profusely ornamented looks like copper. The thing as a whole appears to have been designed for a cheapish jewel-case, now in the last stage of decrepitude. Do I express your sentiments?”
<br> 
<br> “Eloquently and with precision.”
<br> 
<br> “But you, my dear Lexow, are not a connoisseur. I, as chance would have it, have seen a box of this description before; saw one in France, the property of a lady of high degree; and, strange as it may seem, I don’t believe a hundred bright gold pieces such as the one I gave Rebecca, could have induced my French lady friend to part with it. Guess why.”
<br> 
<br> “Why? Oh, I suppose it had certain associations that made her want to keep it. We often prize things quite irrespective of their market value. But go on: don’t be so roundabout.”
<br> 
<br> “Well, the reason—at least one reason—for her setting such store by the box in question—which, I must remind you, was the very duplicate of the one we have here—the reason, I say, was that she knew enough about such matters to recognize that box for a specimen of cinque-cento—a specimen of cinque-cento! Now do you begin to realize that the paltry five dollars were not exorbitant?”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, from the standpoint of an antiquary, an amateur of bric-a-brac, I suppose it was not.”
<br> 
<br> “Excellent! No, sir; on the contrary, it was an immense bargain, a thorough-going stroke of luck. But now please take the box into your own hands, treat it gingerly, inspect it carefully, and tell me whether you remark any thing extraordinary about it.”
<br> 
<br> “Nothing, except that it is extraordinarily ugly and doesn’t speak well for cinque-cento,” I replied, after the requisite examination.
<br> 
<br> “Another proof that das Sehen muss gelernt sein! Here, I will enlighten you.—You behold this metal work which a moment since we disposed of as copper; learn that it is bronze; and not cast bronze, either, but wrought bronze, bronze shaped with hammer and chisel. Look closely at it; note the forms into which it has been modeled. See these roses, these lilies, these lotus leaves; see how exquisitely they are fashioned; see how they are massed together into a harmonious ensemble. Now hold it close to your eyes: see—do you see?—this serpent twined among the flowers! The artist must have worked from life—the very texture of the skin is reproduced—it makes one shudder.”
<br> 
<br> “Yes,” I said, “I admit it is a fine piece of work.”
<br> 
<br> “But we have not yet exhausted the list of its virtues by any means. Now open it and look at the interior.”
<br> 
<br> “I see nothing remarkable about the interior,” I replied, “nothing but bare wood.”
<br> 
<br> “That is all you see; but watch.”
<br> 
<br> He applied the point of a pencil to one of the series of nail-heads with which the top of the lid was studded. It appeared to sink a hair’s-breadth into the wood. Thereat the lower surface of the lid dropped down, disclosing a hollow space between it and the upper.—“A double cover,” he said, “a place for hiding things and—hello! it isn’t empty!”
<br> 
<br> No, it wasn’t empty. It contained a large, square envelope. Merivale hastily made a grab for it, and crossed over to the gas-fixture. “Have we stumbled upon a romance?” he cried. Holding it up to the light, presently he said: “Come hither, Lexow. The writing is German script. I can’t read it. Come and help.”
<br> 
<br> He put the envelope into my hands. I ran my eyes over the writing. Next moment the envelope fluttered to the floor. I grasped Merivale’s arm to support myself. My breath became short and quick. “I was not prepared for this,” I gasped.
<br> 
<br> “For what? What is the trouble?” he asked.
<br> 
<br> I sank into a chair. Merivale picked up the envelope and studied it intently. “I can make nothing out of it,” he said.
<br> 
<br> “Give it to me—I will read it to you,” I rejoined.
<br> 
<br> This is what I read:—
<br> 
<br> “To be delivered to my son, Ernest Neuman, upon his attaining the age of one-and-twenty years. Let there be no failure, as the will of a dying man is honored.—To my son: Open and read on your twenty-first birthday. Be alone when you read.—Your father, Ernest Neuman.”
<br> 
<br> Neither of us broke silence for some minutes afterward.
<br> 
<br> At last, “I guess I’d better clear out,” said Merivale. “This is considerably more than we had bargained for. I suppose you’d like to be alone. I’ll remain in the next room. Call, if you want me.”
<br> 
<br> “Yes,” I returned, “I may as well read it at once. But do you know—it’s quite natural, doubtless—I really dread opening it? Who can tell what its contents may be? Who can tell what information it may convey, to the detriment of that ignorance which is bliss? Who can tell what duty it may impose—what change it may make necessary in my mode of life? I—I am really afraid of it. The superscription is not reassuring—and then, this strange accident by which it has reached its destination after so many years! It is like a fatality.”
<br> 
<br> “It is inevitable that you should feel this way. The suddenness of the business was enough to shatter your self-possession. At the same time you would best not delay about reading it. You won’t be able to rest until you’ve done so, you know.—Yes, indeed, it is like a fatality—like an incident in a novel—one of those happenings that we never expect to see occur in real life. I’ll wait in the next room till you call.”
<br> 
<br> My heart stood still as I broke the seal. Four double sheets of thin glazed paper, covered with minute German script. The ink was faded, and there were a good many blots and interlineations; so that it was only by dint of straining my eyesight to the utmost that I could decipher my father’s message. But screwing up my courage, I attacked it, nor did I pause till I had read the last word.
