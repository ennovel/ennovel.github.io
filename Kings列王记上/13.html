<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then a man of God came from Judah by the order of the Lord to Beth-el, where Jeroboam was by the altar, burning offerings. 
<br>13:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 神 人 奉 耶 和 华 的 命 向 坛 呼 叫 ， 说 ， 坛 哪 ， 坛 哪 。 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 大 卫 家 里 必 生 一 个 儿 子 ， 名 叫 约 西 亚 ， 他 必 将 丘 坛 的 祭 司 ， 就 是 在 你 上 面 烧 香 的 ， 杀 在 你 上 面 ， 人 的 骨 头 也 必 烧 在 你 上 面 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And by the order of the Lord he made an outcry against the altar, saying, O altar, altar, the Lord has said, From the seed of David will come a child, named Josiah, and on you he will put to death the priests of the high places, who are burning offerings on you, and men's bones will be burned on you. 
<br>13:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 当 日 ， 神 人 设 个 预 兆 ， 说 ， 这 坛 必 破 裂 ， 坛 上 的 灰 必 倾 撒 ， 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 预 兆 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The same day he gave them a sign, saying, This is the sign which the Lord has given: See, the altar will be broken and the burned waste on it overturned. 
<br>13:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 罗 波 安 王 听 见 神 人 向 伯 特 利 的 坛 所 呼 叫 的 话 ， 就 从 坛 上 伸 手 ， 说 ， 拿 住 他 吧 。 王 向 神 人 所 伸 的 手 就 枯 干 了 ， 不 能 弯 回 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the king, hearing the man of God crying out against the altar at Beth-el, put out his hand from the altar, saying, Take him prisoner. And his hand, stretched out against him, became dead, and he had no power of pulling it back. 
<br>13:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 坛 也 破 裂 了 ， 坛 上 的 灰 倾 撒 了 ， 正 如 神 人 奉 耶 和 华 的 命 所 设 的 预 兆 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the altar was broken and the burned waste on it overturned; this was the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the Lord. 
<br>13:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 王 对 神 人 说 ， 请 你 为 我 祷 告 ， 求 耶 和 华 你 神 的 恩 典 使 我 的 手 复 原 。 于 是 神 人 祈 祷 耶 和 华 ， 王 的 手 就 复 了 原 ， 仍 如 寻 常 一 样 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the king made answer and said to the man of God, Make a prayer now for the grace of the Lord your God, and for me, that my hand may be made well. And in answer to the prayer of the man of God, the king's hand was made well again, as it was before. 
<br>13:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 王 对 神 人 说 ， 请 你 同 我 回 去 吃 饭 ， 加 添 心 力 ， 我 也 必 给 你 赏 赐 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the king said to the man of God, Come with me to my house for food and rest, and I will give you a reward. 
<br>13:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 神 人 对 王 说 ， 你 就 是 把 你 的 宫 一 半 给 我 ， 我 也 不 同 你 进 去 ， 也 不 在 这 地 方 吃 饭 喝 水 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But the man of God said to the king, Even if you gave me half of all you have, I would not go in with you, and I would not take food or a drink of water in this place; 
<br>13:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 因 为 有 耶 和 华 的 话 嘱 咐 我 ， 说 不 可 在 伯 特 利 吃 饭 喝 水 ， 也 不 可 从 你 去 的 原 路 回 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For so I was ordered by the word of the Lord, who said, You are not to take food or a drink of water, and you are not to go back the way you came. 
<br>13:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 神 人 从 别 的 路 回 去 ， 不 从 伯 特 利 来 的 原 路 回 去 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So he went another way, and not by the way he came to Beth-el. 
<br>13:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 有 一 个 老 先 知 住 在 伯 特 利 ， 他 儿 子 们 来 ， 将 神 人 当 日 在 伯 特 利 所 行 的 一 切 事 和 向 王 所 说 的 话 都 告 诉 了 父 亲 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now there was an old prophet living in Beth-el; and one of his sons came and gave him word of all the man of God had done that day in Beth-el, and they gave their father an account of the words he had said to the king. 
<br>13:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 父 亲 问 他 们 说 ， 神 人 从 哪 条 路 去 了 呢 ？ 儿 子 们 就 告 诉 他 。 原 来 他 们 看 见 那 从 犹 大 来 的 神 人 所 去 的 路 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then their father said to them, Which way did he go? Now his sons had seen which way the man of God who came from Judah had gone. 
<br>13:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 老 先 知 就 吩 咐 他 儿 子 们 说 ， 你 们 为 我 备 驴 。 他 们 备 好 了 驴 ， 他 就 骑 上 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So the prophet said to his sons, Make ready an ass for me. So they made an ass ready, and he got on it, 
<br>13:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 去 追 赶 神 人 ， 遇 见 他 坐 在 橡 树 底 下 ， 就 问 他 说 ， 你 是 从 犹 大 来 的 神 人 不 是 。 他 说 ， 是 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And went after the man of God, and came up with him while he was seated under an oak-tree. And he said to him, Are you the man of God who came from Judah? And he said, I am. 
<br>13:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 老 先 知 对 他 说 ， 请 你 同 我 回 家 吃 饭 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then he said to him, Come back to the house with me and have a meal. 
<br>13:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 神 人 说 ， 我 不 可 同 你 回 去 进 你 的 家 ， 也 不 可 在 这 里 同 你 吃 饭 喝 水 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But he said, I may not go back with you or go into your house; and I will not take food or a drink of water with you in this place; 
<br>13:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 因 为 有 耶 和 华 的 话 嘱 咐 我 说 ， 你 在 那 里 不 可 吃 饭 喝 水 ， 也 不 可 从 你 去 的 原 路 回 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For the Lord said to me, You are not to take food or water there, or go back again by the way you came. 
<br>13:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 老 先 知 对 他 说 ， 我 也 是 先 知 ， 和 你 一 样 。 有 天 使 奉 耶 和 华 的 命 对 我 说 ， 你 去 把 他 带 回 你 的 家 ， 叫 他 吃 饭 喝 水 。 这 都 是 老 先 知 诓 哄 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then he said to him, I am a prophet like you; and an angel said to me by the word of the Lord, Take him back with you and give him food and water. But he said false words to him. 
<br>13:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 神 人 同 老 先 知 回 去 ， 在 他 家 里 吃 饭 喝 水 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So he went back with him, and had a meal in his house and a drink of water. 
<br>13:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 二 人 坐 席 的 时 候 ， 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 那 带 神 人 回 来 的 先 知 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But while they were seated at the table, the word of the Lord came to the prophet who had taken him back; 
<br>13:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 就 对 那 从 犹 大 来 的 神 人 说 ， 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 你 既 违 背 耶 和 华 的 话 ， 不 遵 守 耶 和 华 你 神 的 命 令 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And crying out to the man of God who came from Judah, he said, The Lord says, Because you have gone against the voice of the Lord, and have not done as you were ordered by the Lord, 
<br>13:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 反 倒 回 来 ， 在 耶 和 华 禁 止 你 吃 饭 喝 水 的 地 方 吃 了 喝 了 ， 因 此 你 的 尸 身 不 得 入 你 列 祖 的 坟 墓 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But have come back, and have taken food and water in this place where he said you were to take no food or water; your dead body will not be put to rest with your fathers. 
<br>13:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 吃 喝 完 了 ， 老 先 知 为 所 带 回 来 的 先 知 备 驴 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now after the meal he made ready the ass for him, for the prophet whom he had taken back. 
<br>13:24 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 就 去 了 ， 在 路 上 有 个 狮 子 遇 见 他 ， 将 他 咬 死 ， 尸 身 倒 在 路 上 ， 驴 站 在 尸 身 旁 边 ， 狮 子 也 站 在 尸 身 旁 边 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcase. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he went on his way; but on the road a lion came rushing at him and put him to death; and his dead body was stretched in the road with the ass by its side, and the lion was there by the body. 
<br>13:25 [hgb]&nbsp; 有 人 从 那 里 经 过 ， 看 见 尸 身 倒 在 路 上 ， 狮 子 站 在 尸 身 旁 边 ， 就 来 到 老 先 知 所 住 的 城 里 述 说 这 事 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And some men, going by, saw the body stretched out in the road with the lion by its side; and they came and gave news of it in the town where the old prophet was living. 
<br>13:26 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 带 神 人 回 来 的 先 知 听 见 这 事 ， 就 说 ， 这 是 那 违 背 了 耶 和 华 命 令 的 神 人 ， 所 以 耶 和 华 把 他 交 给 狮 子 。 狮 子 抓 伤 他 ， 咬 死 他 ， 是 应 验 耶 和 华 对 他 说 的 话 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the prophet who had made him come back, hearing it, said, It is the man of God, who went against the word of the Lord; that is why the Lord has given him to the lion to be wounded to death, as the Lord said. 
<br>13:27 [hgb]&nbsp; 老 先 知 就 吩 咐 他 儿 子 们 说 ， 你 们 为 我 备 驴 。 他 们 就 备 了 驴 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said to his sons, Make ready the ass for me. And they did so. 
<br>13:28 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 去 了 ， 看 见 神 人 的 尸 身 倒 在 路 上 ， 驴 和 狮 子 站 在 尸 身 旁 边 ， 狮 子 却 没 有 吃 尸 身 ， 也 没 有 抓 伤 驴 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase, nor torn the ass. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he went and saw the dead body stretched out in the road with the ass and the lion by its side: the lion had not taken the body for its food or done any damage to the ass. 
<br>13:29 [hgb]&nbsp; 老 先 知 就 把 神 人 的 尸 身 驮 在 驴 上 ， 带 回 自 己 的 城 里 ， 要 哀 哭 他 ， 葬 埋 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the prophet took up the body of the man of God and put it on the ass and took it back; and he came to the town to put the body to rest with weeping. 
<br>13:30 [hgb]&nbsp; 就 把 他 的 尸 身 葬 在 自 己 的 坟 墓 里 ， 哀 哭 他 ， 说 ， 哀 哉 。 我 兄 阿 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother! 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he put the body in the resting-place made ready for himself, weeping and sorrowing over it, saying, O my brother! 
<br>13:31 [hgb]&nbsp; 安 葬 之 后 ， 老 先 知 对 他 儿 子 们 说 ， 我 死 了 ， 你 们 要 葬 我 在 神 人 的 坟 墓 里 ， 使 我 的 尸 骨 靠 近 他 的 尸 骨 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when he had put it to rest, he said to his sons, When I am dead, then you are to put my body into the earth with the body of this man of God, and put me by his bones so that my bones may be kept safe with his bones. 
<br>13:32 [hgb]&nbsp; 因 为 他 奉 耶 和 华 的 命 ， 指 着 伯 特 利 的 坛 ， 和 撒 玛 利 亚 各 城 有 丘 坛 之 殿 所 说 的 话 必 定 应 验 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For the outcry he made by the word of the Lord against the altar in Beth-el and against all the houses of the high places in the towns of Samaria, will certainly come about. 
<br>13:33 [hgb]&nbsp; 这 事 以 后 ， 耶 罗 波 安 仍 不 离 开 他 的 恶 道 ， 将 凡 民 立 为 丘 坛 的 祭 司 。 凡 愿 意 的 ， 他 都 分 别 为 圣 ， 立 为 丘 坛 的 祭 司 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; After this Jeroboam, not turning back from his evil ways, still made priests for his altars from among all the people; he made a priest of anyone desiring it, so that there might be priests of the high places. 
<br>13:34 [hgb]&nbsp; 这 事 叫 耶 罗 波 安 的 家 陷 在 罪 里 ， 甚 至 他 的 家 从 地 上 除 灭 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And this became a sin in the family of Jeroboam, causing it to be cut off and sent to destruction from the face of the earth.
