The woman rang the bell. An untidy servant girl made her appearance.</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Mrs. Hardwick spoke to the servant in so low a voice that Jack couldn't hear what she said.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Certainly, mum," answered the servant, and led the way upstairs to a back room on the third floor.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Go in and take a seat," she said to Jack. "I will send Ida to you immediately."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "All right," said Jack, in a tone of satisfaction.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Peg went out, closing the door after her. She, at the same time, softly slipped a bolt which had been placed upon the outside. Then hastening downstairs she found the proprietor of the house, a little old man with a shrewd, twinkling eye, and a long, aquiline nose.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have brought you a boarder," she said.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Who is it?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "A lad, who is likely to interfere in our plans. You may keep him in confinement for the present."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Very good. Is he likely to make a fuss?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I should think it very likely. He is high-spirited and impetuous, but you know how to manage him."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, yes," nodded the old man.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You can think of some pretext for keeping him."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Suppose I tell him he's in a madhouse?" said the old man, laughing, and thereby showing some yellow fangs, which by no means improved his appearance.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Just the thing! It'll frighten him."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 There was a little further conversation in a low tone, and then Peg went away.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Fairly trapped, my young bird!" she thought to herself. "I think that will put a stop to your troublesome appearance for the present."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Meanwhile Jack, wholly unsuspicious that any trick had been played upon him, seated himself in a rocking-chair and waited impatiently for the coming of Ida, whom he was resolved to carry back to New York.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Impelled by a natural curiosity, he examined attentively the room in which he was seated. There was a plain carpet on the floor, and the other furniture was that of an ordinary bed chamber. The most conspicuous ornament was a large full-length portrait against the side of the wall. It represented an unknown man, not particularly striking in his appearance. There was, besides, a small table with two or three books upon it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Jack waited patiently for twenty minutes.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Perhaps Ida may be out," he reflected. "Still, even if she is, Mrs. Hardwick ought to come and let me know. It's dull work staying here alone."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Another fifteen minutes passed, and still no Ida appeared.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "This is rather singular," thought Jack. "She can't have told Ida I am here, or I am sure she would rush up at once to see her brother Jack."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 At length, tired of waiting, Jack walked to the door and attempted to open it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 There was a greater resistance than he anticipated.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Good heavens!" thought Jack, in consternation, as the real state of the case flashed upon him, "is it possible that I am locked in?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He employed all his strength, but the door still resisted. He could no longer doubt that it was locked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He rushed to the windows. They were two in number, and looked out upon a yard in the rear of the house. There was no hope of drawing the attention of passersby to his situation.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Confounded by this discovery, Jack sank into his chair in no very enviable state of mind.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well," thought he, "this is a pretty situation for me to be in. I wonder what father would say if he knew that I had managed to get locked up like this? I am ashamed to think I let that treacherous woman, Mrs. Hardwick, lead me so quietly into a snare. Aunt Rachel was about right when she said I wasn't fit to come alone. I hope she'll never find out about this adventure of mine. If she did, I should never hear the last of it."
