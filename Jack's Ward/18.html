<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 After an hour she was released.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well," said the nurse, grimly, "how do you feel now?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I want to go home," sobbed the child.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You are at home," said the woman.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Shall I never see father, and mother, and Jack again?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That depends on how you behave yourself."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, if you will only let me go," pleaded Ida, gathering hope from this remark, "I'll do anything you say."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you mean this, or do you only say it for the sake of getting away?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I mean just what I say. Dear, good Mrs. Hardwick, tell me what to do, and I will obey you cheerfully."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Very well," said Peg, "only you needn't try to come it over me by calling me dear, good Mrs. Hardwick. In the first place, you don't care a cent about me; in the second place, I am not good; and finally, my name isn't Mrs. Hardwick, except in New York."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What is it, then?" asked Ida.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It's just Peg, no more and no less. You may call me Aunt Peg."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I would rather call you Mrs. Hardwick."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then you'll have a good many years to call me so. You'd better do as I tell you, if you want any favors. Now what do you say?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, Aunt Peg," said Ida, with a strong effort to conceal her repugnance.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That's well. Now you're not to tell anybody that you came from New York. That is very important; and you're to pay your board by doing whatever I tell you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "If it isn't wicked."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you suppose I would ask you to do anything wicked?" demanded Peg, frowning.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You said you wasn't good," mildly suggested Ida.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I'm good enough to take care of you. Well, what do you say to that? Answer me?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "There's another thing. You ain't to try to run away."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Ida hung down her head.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Ha!" exclaimed Peg. "So you've been thinking of it, have you?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes," answered Ida, boldly, after a moment's hesitation. "I did think I should if I got a good chance."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Humph!" said the woman, "I see we must understand one another. Unless you promise this, back you go into the dark closet, and I shall keep you there."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Ida shuddered at this fearful threat--terrible to a child of but eight years.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you promise?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes," said Ida, faintly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "For fear you might be tempted to break your promise, I have something to show you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Mrs. Hardwick went to the closet, and took down a large pistol.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "There," she said, "do you see that?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, Aunt Peg."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you know what it is for?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "To shoot people with," answered the child.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes," said the nurse; "I see you understand. Well, now, do you know what I would do if you should tell anybody where you came from, or attempt to run away? Can you guess, now?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Would you shoot me?" asked Ida, terror-stricken.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, I would," said Peg, with fierce emphasis. "That's just what I'd do. And what's more even if you got away, and got back to your family in New York, I would follow you, and shoot you dead in the street."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You wouldn't be so wicked!" exclaimed Ida.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Wouldn't I, though?" repeated Peg, significantly. "If you don't believe I would, just try it. Do you think you would like to try it?" she asked, fiercely.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No," answered Ida, with a shudder.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, that's the most sensible thing you've said yet. Now that you are a little more reasonable, I'll tell you what I am going to do with you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Ida looked eagerly up into her face.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am going to keep you with me for a year. I want the services of a little girl for that time. If you serve me faithfully, I will then send you back to New York."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Will you?" asked Ida, hopefully.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, but you must mind and do what I tell you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, yes," said Ida, joyfully.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 This was so much better than she had been led to fear, that the prospect of returning home at all, even though she had to wait a year, encouraged her.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What do you want me to do?" she asked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You may take the broom and sweep the room."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, Aunt Peg."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And then you may wash the dishes."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, Aunt Peg."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And after that, I will find something else for you to do."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Mrs. Hardwick threw herself into a rocking-chair, and watched with grim satisfaction the little handmaiden, as she moved quickly about.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I took the right course with her," she said to herself. "She won't any more dare to run away than to chop her hands off. She thinks I'll shoot her."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 And the unprincipled woman chuckled to herself.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Ida heard her indistinctly, and asked, timidly:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Did you speak, Aunt Peg?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, I didn't; just attend to your work and don't mind me. Did your mother make you work?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No; I went to school."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Time you learned. I'll make a smart woman of you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The next morning Ida was asked if she would like to go out into the street.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am going to let you do a little shopping. There are various things we want. Go and get your hat."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It's in the closet," said Ida.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, yes, I put it there. That was before I could trust you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She went to the closet and returned with the child's hat and shawl. As soon as the two were ready they emerged into the street.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "This is a little better than being shut up in the closet, isn't it?" asked her companion.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, yes, ever so much."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You see you'll have a very good time of it, if you do as I bid you. I don't want to do you any harm."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 So they walked along together until Peg, suddenly pausing, laid her hands on Ida's arm, and pointing to a shop near by, said to her: "Do you see that shop?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes," said Ida.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I want you to go in and ask for a couple of rolls. They come to three cents apiece. Here's some money to pay for them. It is a new dollar. You will give this to the man that stands behind the counter, and he will give you back ninety-four cents. Do you understand?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes," said Ida, nodding her head. "I think I do."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And if the man asks if you have anything smaller, you will say no."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, Aunt Peg."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I will stay just outside. I want you to go in alone, so you will learn to manage without me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Ida entered the shop. The baker, a pleasant-looking man, stood behind the counter.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, my dear, what is it?" he asked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I should like a couple of rolls."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "For your mother, I suppose?" said the baker.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No," answered Ida, "for the woman I board with."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Ha! a dollar bill, and a new one, too," said the baker, as Ida tendered it in payment. "I shall have to save that for my little girl."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Ida left the shop with the two rolls and the silver change.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Did he say anything about the money?" asked Peg.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He said he should save it for his little girl."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Good!" said the woman. "You've done well."
