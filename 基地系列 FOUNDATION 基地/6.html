As the center of&nbsp; the Imperial Government for unbrokenhundreds of generations and&nbsp; located, as it was, toward the central regionsof the&nbsp; Galaxy among&nbsp; the most densely populated&nbsp; and industrially advancedworlds of the system,&nbsp; it could scarcely help being the densest and richestclot of humanity the Race had ever seen.
<br> Its urbanization,&nbsp; progressing steadily, had finally&nbsp; reached the ultimate.
<br> All the&nbsp; land surface of Trantor, 75,000,000 square&nbsp; miles in extent, was asingle city.&nbsp; The population,&nbsp; at its height,&nbsp; was well in&nbsp; excess of fortybillions.&nbsp; This&nbsp; enormous population&nbsp; was&nbsp; devoted almost&nbsp; entirely to&nbsp; theadministrative necessities of Empire,&nbsp; and found themselves all too few forthe&nbsp; complications&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; task.&nbsp; (It&nbsp; is&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; remembered&nbsp; that&nbsp; theimpossibility&nbsp; of proper&nbsp; administration of&nbsp; the Galactic Empire&nbsp; under theuninspired leadership&nbsp; of the&nbsp; later Emperors was a&nbsp; considerable factor inthe&nbsp; Fall.) Daily,&nbsp; fleets of ships&nbsp; in the&nbsp; tens of thousands&nbsp; brought theproduce of&nbsp; twenty agricultural worlds to&nbsp; the dinner tables of Trantor....
<br> Its&nbsp; dependence&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; outer worlds&nbsp; for&nbsp; food&nbsp; and,&nbsp; indeed, for&nbsp; allnecessities of&nbsp; life, made&nbsp; Trantor increasingly vulnerable&nbsp; to conquest bysiege.&nbsp; In the&nbsp; last millennium&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Empire, the&nbsp; monotonously numerousrevolts made&nbsp; Emperor after Emperor conscious&nbsp; of this, and Imperial policybecame&nbsp; little&nbsp; more&nbsp; than the&nbsp; protection&nbsp; of&nbsp; Trantor's delicate&nbsp; jugularvein....
<br> ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICAGaal was not certain whether the sun shone, or, for that matter, whether itwas day&nbsp; or night.&nbsp; He was ashamed&nbsp; to ask. All&nbsp; the planet&nbsp; seemed to livebeneath metal.&nbsp; The meal&nbsp; of which he&nbsp; had just partaken&nbsp; had been labelledluncheon, but there were many planets which lived a standard timescale thattook no&nbsp; account of the perhaps inconvenient&nbsp; alternation of day and night.
<br> The&nbsp; rate of&nbsp; planetary&nbsp; turnings differed,&nbsp; and he&nbsp; did&nbsp; not know&nbsp; that ofTrantor.
<br> At first, he had&nbsp; eagerly followed the signs to the "Sun Room" and found itbut a chamber for&nbsp; basking in artificial radiation. He lingered a moment ortwo, then returned to the Luxor's main lobby.
<br> He said to the room clerk, "Where can I buy a ticket for a planetary tour?""Right here.""When will it start?""You&nbsp; just missed&nbsp; it. Another&nbsp; one tomorrow.&nbsp; Buy a&nbsp; ticket now&nbsp; and we'llreserve a place for you.""Oh." Tomorrow&nbsp; would be&nbsp; too late. He&nbsp; would have to be&nbsp; at the Universitytomorrow. He said, "There&nbsp; wouldn't be an observation tower ?or something?
<br> I mean, in the open air.""Sure! Sell you a ticket for that, if you want. Better let me check if it'sraining&nbsp; or not." He&nbsp; closed a contact&nbsp; at his&nbsp; elbow and read&nbsp; the flowingletters&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; raced&nbsp; across&nbsp; a&nbsp; frosted&nbsp;&nbsp; screen.&nbsp; Gaal&nbsp; read&nbsp; with&nbsp; him.
<br> The room clerk said,&nbsp; "Good weather. Come to think of it, I do believe it'sthe dry&nbsp; season now." He added, conversationally,&nbsp; "I don't bother with theoutside myself.&nbsp; The last time I&nbsp; was in the open&nbsp; was three years ago. Yousee it&nbsp; once, you know and&nbsp; that's all there is&nbsp; to it. Here's your ticket.
<br> Special elevator&nbsp; in the rear. It's&nbsp; marked 'To the Tower.'&nbsp; Just take it."The&nbsp; elevator was&nbsp; of the&nbsp; new sort&nbsp; that ran&nbsp; by gravitic&nbsp; repulsion. Gaalentered and others flowed in behind him. The operator closed a contact. Fora moment,&nbsp; Gaal felt&nbsp; suspended in space&nbsp; as gravity switched&nbsp; to zero, andthen&nbsp; he had&nbsp; weight&nbsp; again in&nbsp; small measure&nbsp; as the&nbsp; elevator acceleratedupward.&nbsp; Deceleration followed&nbsp; and his&nbsp; feet left&nbsp; the floor.&nbsp; He squawkedagainst his will.
<br> The operator called out,&nbsp; "Tuck your feet under the railing. Can't you readthe sign?"The others&nbsp; had done&nbsp; so. They were smiling&nbsp; at him as he&nbsp; madly and vainlytried to clamber back down the wall. Their shoes pressed upward against thechromium of&nbsp; the railings that stretched across&nbsp; the floor in parallels settwo feet&nbsp; apart. He had noticed those railings&nbsp; on entering and had ignoredthem.
<br> Then a hand reached out and pulled him down.
<br> He gasped his thanks as the elevator came to a halt.
<br> He stepped out upon&nbsp; an open terrace bathed in a white brilliance that hurlhis eyes.&nbsp; The man, whose helping&nbsp; hand he had just&nbsp; now been the recipientof, was immediately behind him.
<br> The man said, kindly, "Plenty of seats."Gaal closed&nbsp; his mouth; he had&nbsp; been gaping; and said,&nbsp; "It certainly seemsso." He started for them automatically, then stopped.
<br> He said, "If you&nbsp; don't mind, I'll just stop a moment at the railing. I ?Iwant to look a bit."The&nbsp; man&nbsp; waved&nbsp; him&nbsp; on, good-naturedly,&nbsp; and&nbsp; Gaal&nbsp; leaned&nbsp; out over&nbsp; theshoulder-high&nbsp;&nbsp; railing&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; bathed&nbsp;&nbsp; himself&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; all&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; panorama.
<br> He&nbsp; could&nbsp; not&nbsp; see&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was&nbsp; lost&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; ever&nbsp; increasingcomplexities&nbsp; of man-made structures.&nbsp; He could&nbsp; see no horizon&nbsp; other thanthat of&nbsp; metal against sky, stretching out&nbsp; to almost uniform grayness, andhe&nbsp; knew it&nbsp; was&nbsp; so over&nbsp; all the&nbsp; land-surface of&nbsp; the planet.&nbsp; There wasscarcely any&nbsp; motion to&nbsp; be seen ? a few pleasure-craft&nbsp; lazed against thesky-but all&nbsp; the busy&nbsp; traffic of billions&nbsp; of men were going&nbsp; on, he knew,beneath the metal skin of the world.
<br> There was no&nbsp; green to be seen; no green, no soil,&nbsp; no life other than man.
<br> Somewhere on the world,&nbsp; he realized vaguely, was the Emperor's palace, setamid one hundred square&nbsp; miles of natural soil, green with trees, rainbowedwith flowers.&nbsp; It was a small island amid an ocean&nbsp; of steel, but it wasn'tvisible from&nbsp; where he stood. It&nbsp; might be ten thousand&nbsp; miles away. He didnot know.
<br> Before very long, he must have his tour!
<br> He sighed noisily, and&nbsp; realized finally that he was on Trantor at last; onthe planet&nbsp; which was&nbsp; the center of all&nbsp; the Galaxy and the&nbsp; kernel of thehuman race. He saw none of its weaknesses. He saw no ships of food landing.
<br> He was not aware&nbsp; of a jugular vein delicately connecting the forty billionof&nbsp; Trantor with&nbsp; the&nbsp; rest of&nbsp; the Galaxy.&nbsp; He was&nbsp; conscious only&nbsp; of themightiest&nbsp; deed&nbsp; of&nbsp; man;&nbsp; the&nbsp; complete and&nbsp; almost&nbsp; contemptuously&nbsp; finalconquest of a world.
<br> He came away a little blank-eyed. His friend of the elevator was indicatinga seat next to himself and Gaal took it.
<br> The&nbsp;&nbsp; man&nbsp; smiled.&nbsp;&nbsp; "My&nbsp;&nbsp; name&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp; Jerril.&nbsp; First&nbsp;&nbsp; time&nbsp;&nbsp; on&nbsp; Trantor?""Yes, Mr. Jerril.""Thought so.&nbsp; Jerril's my&nbsp; first name. Trantor&nbsp; gets you if&nbsp; you've got thepoetic temperament. Trantorians never come up here, though. They don't likeit. Gives them nerves.""Nerves! ?My name's Gaal, by the way. Why should it give them nerves? It'sglorious.""Subjective matter&nbsp; of opinion, Gaal. If you're born&nbsp; in a cubicle and growup in&nbsp; a corridor, and work in a cell, and&nbsp; vacation in a crowded sun-room,then coming up into&nbsp; the open with nothing but sky over you might just giveyou a&nbsp; nervous breakdown. They make the children come&nbsp; up here once a year,after they're five. I don't know if it does any good. They don't get enoughof&nbsp; it,&nbsp; really,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the first&nbsp; few&nbsp; times&nbsp; they&nbsp; scream themselves&nbsp; intohysteria. They&nbsp; ought to start as soon as they're&nbsp; weaned and have the triponce a week."He went&nbsp; on, "Of course, it doesn't really matter.&nbsp; What if they never comeout at&nbsp; all? They're happy down there and they run&nbsp; the Empire. How high updo you think we are?"He&nbsp;&nbsp; said,&nbsp; "Half&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; mile?"&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; wondered&nbsp; if&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; sounded&nbsp; naive.
<br> It must have, for Jerril chuckled a little. He said, "No. Just five hundredfeet.""What? But the elevator took about ?
<br> "I&nbsp; know. But&nbsp; most of&nbsp; the time it&nbsp; was just&nbsp; getting up to&nbsp; ground level.
<br> Trantor is tunneled over&nbsp; a mile down. It's like an iceberg. Nine-tenths ofit is out of sight. It even works itself out a few miles into the sub-oceansoil at the shorelines.&nbsp; In fact, we're down so low that we can make use ofthe temperature difference between ground level and a couple of miles underto&nbsp; supply&nbsp;&nbsp; us&nbsp; with&nbsp; all&nbsp; the&nbsp; energy&nbsp; we&nbsp;&nbsp; need.&nbsp; Did&nbsp; you&nbsp; know&nbsp; that?""No, I thought you used atomic generators.""Did once. But this is cheaper.""I imagine so.""What&nbsp; do&nbsp; you think&nbsp; of&nbsp; it&nbsp; all?" For&nbsp; a&nbsp; moment, the&nbsp; man's good&nbsp; natureevaporated into shrewdness. He looked almost sly.
<br> Gaal fumbled. "Glorious," he said, again.
<br> "Here on vacation? Traveling? Sight-seeing?""No exactly. At least,&nbsp; I've always wanted to visit Trantor but I came hereprimarily for a job.""Oh?"Gaal felt&nbsp; obliged to&nbsp; explain further, "With&nbsp; Dr. Seldon's project&nbsp; at theUniversity of Trantor.""Raven Seldon?""Why, no.&nbsp; The one&nbsp; I mean is&nbsp; Hari Seldon. -The&nbsp; psychohistorian Seldon. Idon't know of any Raven Seldon.""Hari's&nbsp; the one I&nbsp; mean. They call&nbsp; him Raven.&nbsp; Slang, you know.&nbsp; He keepspredicting disaster.""He does?" Gaal was genuinely astonished.
<br> "Surely, you must know." Jerril was not smiling. "You're coming to work forhim, aren't you?""Well, yes, I'm a mathematician. Why does he predict disaster? What kind ofdisaster?""What kind would you think?""I'm afraid I wouldn't have the least idea. I've read the papers Dr. Seldonand&nbsp;&nbsp; his&nbsp; group&nbsp;&nbsp; have&nbsp;&nbsp; published.&nbsp; They're&nbsp;&nbsp; on&nbsp; mathematical&nbsp;&nbsp; theory.""Yes, the ones they publish."Gaal felt&nbsp; annoyed. He said, "I think I'll go to&nbsp; my room now. Very pleasedto have met you."Jerril waved his arm indifferently in farewell.
<br> Gaal found&nbsp; a man&nbsp; waiting for him&nbsp; in his room.&nbsp; For a moment,&nbsp; he was toostartled to put into&nbsp; words the inevitable, "What are you doing here?" thatcame to his lips.
<br> The man rose. He was old and almost bald and he walked with a limp, but hiseyes were very bright and blue.
<br> He&nbsp; said, "I&nbsp; am&nbsp; Hari Seldon,"&nbsp; an instant&nbsp; before Gaal's&nbsp; befuddled brainplaced the&nbsp; face alongside the memory&nbsp; of the many times&nbsp; he had seen it inpictures.
