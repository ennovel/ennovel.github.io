It was in its third day. Yet already, Gaal could no longerstretch his memory back far enough to embrace its beginning.
<br> He himself&nbsp; had been but little&nbsp; pecked at. The heavy&nbsp; guns were trained onDr. Seldon&nbsp; himself. Hari Seldon, however,&nbsp; sat there unperturbed. To Gaal,he&nbsp;&nbsp; was&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; only&nbsp;&nbsp; spot&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; stability&nbsp;&nbsp; remaining&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; world.
<br> The audience&nbsp; was small and drawn exclusively from&nbsp; among the Barons of theEmpire.&nbsp; Press&nbsp; and public&nbsp; were&nbsp; excluded&nbsp; and it&nbsp; was&nbsp; doubtful that&nbsp; anysignificant number of outsiders&nbsp; even knew that a trial of Seldon was beingconducted.&nbsp; The&nbsp; atmosphere&nbsp; was one&nbsp; of&nbsp; unrelieved&nbsp; hostility toward&nbsp; thedefendants.
<br> Five of&nbsp; the Commission of Public&nbsp; Safety sat behind the&nbsp; raised desk. Theywore scarlet and gold&nbsp; uniforms and the shining, close-fitting plastic capsthat were the sign&nbsp; of their judicial function. In the center was the ChiefCommissioner Linge Chen. Gaal&nbsp; had never before seen so great a Lord and hewatched&nbsp; him with fascination.&nbsp; Chen, throughout&nbsp; the trial, rarely&nbsp; said aword.&nbsp; He made&nbsp; it quite clear&nbsp; that much&nbsp; speech was beneath&nbsp; his dignity.
<br> The&nbsp; Commission's&nbsp;&nbsp; Advocate&nbsp; consulted&nbsp; his&nbsp; notes&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; examinationcontinued, with Seldon still on the stand:
<br> Q. Let us&nbsp; see, Dr. Seldon. How many men are now&nbsp; engaged in the project ofwhich you are head?
<br> A. Fifty mathematicians.
<br> Q. Including Dr. Gaal Dornick?
<br> A. Dr. Dornick is the fifty-first,Q.&nbsp; Oh, we&nbsp; have fifty-one&nbsp; then? Search&nbsp; your memory, Dr.&nbsp; Seldon. Perhapsthere&nbsp;&nbsp; are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fifty-two&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp; fifty-three?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perhaps&nbsp;&nbsp; even&nbsp;&nbsp; more?
<br> A. Dr.&nbsp; Dornick has not yet formally joined&nbsp; my organization. When he does,the&nbsp; membership&nbsp; will be&nbsp; fifty-one.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is now&nbsp; fifty,&nbsp; as&nbsp; I have&nbsp; said.
<br> Q. Not perhaps nearly a hundred thousand?
<br> A. Mathematicians? No.
<br> Q.&nbsp; I did&nbsp; not&nbsp; say mathematicians.&nbsp; Are there&nbsp; a&nbsp; hundred thousand&nbsp; in allcapacities?
<br> A. In all capacities, your figure may be correct.
<br> Q.&nbsp; May&nbsp; be? I&nbsp; say&nbsp; it is.&nbsp; I&nbsp; say that&nbsp; the&nbsp; men in&nbsp; your project&nbsp; numberninety-eight thousand, five hundred and seventy-two.
<br> A. I believe you are counting women and children.
<br> Q. (raising&nbsp; his voice) Ninety eight&nbsp; thousand five hundred and seventy-twoindividuals is&nbsp; the intent&nbsp; of my statement.&nbsp; There is no&nbsp; need to quibble.
<br> A. I accept the figures.
<br> Q. (referring to his notes) Let us drop that for the moment, then, and takeup another matter which we have already discussed at some length. Would yourepeat,&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Seldon,&nbsp; your&nbsp; thoughts&nbsp; concerning the&nbsp; future&nbsp; of&nbsp; Trantor?
<br> A. I have said,&nbsp; and I say again, that Trantor will lie in ruins within thenext three centuries.
<br> Q. You do not consider your statement a disloyal one?
<br> A.&nbsp;&nbsp; No,&nbsp; sir.&nbsp;&nbsp; Scientific&nbsp; truth&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; beyond&nbsp; loyalty&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; disloyalty.
<br> Q.&nbsp; You&nbsp;&nbsp; are&nbsp; sure&nbsp; that&nbsp; your&nbsp;&nbsp; statement&nbsp; represents&nbsp; scientific&nbsp; truth?
<br> A. I am.
<br> Q. On what basis?
<br> A. On the basis of the mathematics of psychohistory.
<br> Q. Can you prove that this mathematics is valid'?
<br> A. Only to another mathematician.
<br> Q. (with&nbsp; a smile) Your claim&nbsp; then is that your truth&nbsp; is of so esoteric anature that&nbsp; it is beyond the understanding of a plain&nbsp; man. It seems to methat truth&nbsp; should be clearer than that, less&nbsp; mysterious, more open to themind.
<br> A.&nbsp; It&nbsp; presents no&nbsp; difficulties&nbsp; to&nbsp; some minds.&nbsp; The&nbsp; physics of&nbsp; energytransfer, which we know&nbsp; as thermodynamics, has been clear and true throughall the&nbsp; history of&nbsp; man since the&nbsp; mythical ages, yet there&nbsp; may be peoplepresent who&nbsp; would find it impossible&nbsp; to design a power&nbsp; engine. People ofhigh&nbsp;&nbsp; intelligence,&nbsp;&nbsp; too.&nbsp; I&nbsp;&nbsp; doubt&nbsp;&nbsp; if&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; learned&nbsp;&nbsp; Commissioners?
<br> At this&nbsp; point, one&nbsp; of the Commissioners&nbsp; leaned toward the&nbsp; Advocate. Hiswords&nbsp; were&nbsp; not heard&nbsp; but&nbsp; the hissing&nbsp; of&nbsp; the voice&nbsp; carried a&nbsp; certainasperity. The Advocate flushed and interrupted Seldon.
<br> Q. We&nbsp; are not here to&nbsp; listen to speeches, Dr.&nbsp; Seldon. Let us assume thatyou have&nbsp; made your point. Let&nbsp; me suggest to you&nbsp; that your predictions ofdisaster&nbsp; might be intended&nbsp; to destroy&nbsp; public confidence in&nbsp; the ImperialGovernment for purposes of your own.
<br> A. That is not so.
<br> Q. Let me suggest&nbsp; that you intend to claim that a period of time precedingthe so-called ruin of&nbsp; Trantor will be filled with unrest of various types.
<br> A. That is correct.
<br> Q. And that by the mere prediction thereof, you hope to bring it about, andto have then an army of a hundred thousand available.
<br> A. In&nbsp; the first place, that is not so. And&nbsp; if it were, investigation willshow&nbsp; you that barely&nbsp; ten thousand are&nbsp; men of&nbsp; military age, and&nbsp; none ofthese has training in arms.
<br> Q. Are you acting as an agent for another?
<br> A. I am not in the pay of any man, Mr. Advocate.
<br> Q.&nbsp;&nbsp; You&nbsp;&nbsp; are&nbsp;&nbsp; entirely&nbsp;&nbsp; disinterested?&nbsp;&nbsp; You&nbsp;&nbsp; are&nbsp;&nbsp; serving&nbsp;&nbsp; science?
<br> A. I am.
<br> Q.&nbsp; Then&nbsp; let&nbsp; us&nbsp;&nbsp; see&nbsp; how.&nbsp; Can&nbsp; the&nbsp; future&nbsp; be&nbsp; changed,&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Seldon?
<br> A. Obviously.&nbsp; This courtroom may explode in the next&nbsp; few hours, or it maynot.&nbsp; If it&nbsp; did, the&nbsp; future would&nbsp; undoubtedly be&nbsp; changed in&nbsp; some minorrespects.
<br> Q. You&nbsp; quibble, Dr. Seldon. Can&nbsp; the overall history of&nbsp; the human race bechanged?
<br> A. Yes.
<br> Q. Easily?
<br> A. No. With great difficulty.
<br> Q. Why?
<br> A.&nbsp; The psychohistoric&nbsp; trend of&nbsp; a planet-full&nbsp; of people contains&nbsp; a hugeinertia. To&nbsp; be changed it must be met&nbsp; with something possessing a similarinertia.&nbsp; Either as&nbsp; many people&nbsp; must be&nbsp; concerned, or&nbsp; if the&nbsp; number ofpeople be&nbsp; relatively small, enormous&nbsp; time for change must&nbsp; be allowed. Doyou understand?
<br> Q. I think I&nbsp; do. Trantor need not be ruined, if a great many people decideto act so that it will not.
<br> A. That is right.
<br> Q. As many as a hundred thousand people?
<br> A. No, sir. That is far too few.
<br> Q. You are sure?
<br> A. Consider that Trantor&nbsp; has a population of over forty billions. Considerfurther that the trend leading to ruin does not belong to Trantor alone butto the Empire as a whole and the Empire contains nearly a quintillion humanbeings.
<br> Q. I&nbsp; see. Then perhaps a hundred thousand people&nbsp; can change the trend, ifthey&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their&nbsp;&nbsp; descendants&nbsp;&nbsp; labor&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; three&nbsp;&nbsp; hundred&nbsp;&nbsp; years.
<br> A.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm&nbsp; afraid&nbsp;&nbsp; not.&nbsp; Three&nbsp;&nbsp; hundred&nbsp; years&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; too&nbsp; short&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp; time.
<br> Q. Ah! In that case, Dr. Seldon, we are left with this deduction to be madefrom your statements. You&nbsp; have gathered one hundred thousand people withinthe confines of your&nbsp; project. These are insufficient to change the historyof Trantor within three&nbsp; hundred years. In other words, they cannot preventthe destruction of Trantor no matter what they do.
<br> A. You are unfortunately correct.
<br> Q. And on the other hand, your hundred thousand are intended for no illegalpurpose.
<br> A. Exactly.
<br> Q. (slowly&nbsp; and with&nbsp; satisfaction) In that&nbsp; case, Dr. Seldon? Now attend,sir, most&nbsp; carefully, for we want a considered&nbsp; answer. What is the purposeof your hundred thousand?
<br> The Advocate's&nbsp; voice had&nbsp; grown strident. He&nbsp; had sprung his&nbsp; trap; backedSeldon into a comer; driven him astutely from any possibility of answering.
<br> There was&nbsp; a rising buzz of&nbsp; conversation at that which&nbsp; swept the ranks ofthe peers&nbsp; in the audience and invaded even&nbsp; the row of Commissioners. Theyswayed&nbsp; toward&nbsp; one another&nbsp; in&nbsp; their&nbsp; scarlet and&nbsp; gold,&nbsp; only the&nbsp; Chiefremaining uncorrupted.
<br> Hari&nbsp; Seldon&nbsp; remained unmoved.&nbsp; He&nbsp; waited&nbsp; for the&nbsp; babble to&nbsp; evaporate.
<br> A. To minimize the effects of that destruction.
<br> Q. And exactly what do you mean by that?
<br> A. The&nbsp; explanation is simple. The coming destruction&nbsp; of Trantor is not anevent in&nbsp; itself, isolated in the&nbsp; scheme of human development.&nbsp; It will bethe climax to an intricate drama which was begun centuries ago and which isaccelerating in&nbsp; pace continuously.&nbsp; I refer, gentlemen,&nbsp; to the developingdecline and fall of the Galactic Empire.
<br> The buzz now became&nbsp; a dull roar. The Advocate, unheeded, was yelling, "Youare openly declaring that? and stopped because the cries of "Treason" fromthe audience&nbsp; showed that&nbsp; the point had&nbsp; been made without&nbsp; any hammering.
<br> Slowly, the&nbsp; Chief Commissioner raised his gavel once&nbsp; and let it drop. Thesound was that of a mellow gong. When the reverberations ceased, the gabbleof&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; audience&nbsp; also&nbsp;&nbsp; did.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;&nbsp; Advocate&nbsp; took&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp; deep&nbsp;&nbsp; breath.
<br> Q. (theatrically)&nbsp; Do you realize, Dr. Seldon, that&nbsp; you are speaking of anEmpire&nbsp; that&nbsp; has&nbsp; stood&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp; twelve&nbsp; thousand&nbsp; years,&nbsp; through&nbsp; all&nbsp; thevicissitudes of&nbsp; the generations, and&nbsp; which has behind it&nbsp; the good wishesand love of a quadrillion human beings?
<br> A.&nbsp; I am&nbsp; aware both&nbsp; of the&nbsp; present status&nbsp; and the&nbsp; past history&nbsp; of theEmpire. Without disrespect, I&nbsp; must claim a far better knowledge of it thanany in this room.
<br> Q. And you predict its ruin?
<br> A.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; a&nbsp; prediction which&nbsp; is made&nbsp; by&nbsp; mathematics. I&nbsp; pass&nbsp; no moraljudgements.&nbsp; Personally, I&nbsp; regret the&nbsp; prospect. Even&nbsp; if the&nbsp; Empire wereadmitted&nbsp; to be&nbsp; a bad&nbsp; thing (an admission&nbsp; I do&nbsp; not make), the&nbsp; state ofanarchy which&nbsp; would follow&nbsp; its fall would&nbsp; be worse. It is&nbsp; that state ofanarchy&nbsp; which&nbsp; my&nbsp; project&nbsp; is&nbsp; pledged&nbsp; to&nbsp; fight. The&nbsp; fall&nbsp; of&nbsp; Empire,gentlemen,&nbsp; is a&nbsp; massive&nbsp; thing, however,&nbsp; and&nbsp; not easily&nbsp; fought. It&nbsp; isdictated&nbsp; by a&nbsp; rising bureaucracy,&nbsp; a receding&nbsp; initiative, a&nbsp; freezing ofcaste, a damming of&nbsp; curiosity ?a hundred other factors. It has been goingon, as&nbsp; I have&nbsp; said, for centuries, and&nbsp; it is too majestic&nbsp; and massive amovement to stop.
<br> Q. Is it not obvious to anyone that the Empire is as strong as it ever was?
<br> A.&nbsp; The appearance&nbsp; of strength&nbsp; is all&nbsp; about you.&nbsp; It would seem&nbsp; to lastforever.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; Mr. Advocate,&nbsp; the&nbsp; rotten tree-trunk,&nbsp; until the&nbsp; verymoment when&nbsp; the storm-blast&nbsp; breaks it in&nbsp; two, has all&nbsp; the appearance ofmight it&nbsp; ever had.&nbsp; The storm-blast whistles&nbsp; through the branches&nbsp; of theEmpire even&nbsp; now. Listen with the ears of&nbsp; psychohistory, and you will hearthe creaking.
<br> Q. (uncertainly) We are not here, Dr. Seldon, to lis?
<br> A.&nbsp; (firmly)&nbsp; The&nbsp; Empire&nbsp; will&nbsp; vanish&nbsp; and&nbsp; all&nbsp; its good&nbsp; with&nbsp; it.&nbsp; Itsaccumulated knowledge will decay&nbsp; and the order it has imposed will vanish.
<br> Interstellar&nbsp; wars&nbsp;&nbsp; will&nbsp; be&nbsp; endless;&nbsp; interstellar&nbsp;&nbsp; trade&nbsp; will&nbsp; decay;population will&nbsp; decline; worlds will lose touch with&nbsp; the main body of theGalaxy. 朅nd so matters will remain.
<br> Q.&nbsp;&nbsp; (a&nbsp; small&nbsp;&nbsp; voice&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; middle&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; vast&nbsp;&nbsp; silence)&nbsp; Forever?
<br> A.&nbsp; Psychohistory,&nbsp; which&nbsp; can&nbsp;&nbsp; predict&nbsp; the&nbsp; fall,&nbsp; can&nbsp; make&nbsp; statementsconcerning&nbsp; the succeeding dark&nbsp; ages. The&nbsp; Empire, gentlemen, as&nbsp; has justbeen&nbsp; said, has&nbsp; stood twelve thousand&nbsp; years. The&nbsp; dark ages to&nbsp; come willendure not&nbsp; twelve, but thirty&nbsp; thousand years. A Second&nbsp; Empire will rise,but between&nbsp; it and&nbsp; our civilization will&nbsp; be one thousand&nbsp; generations ofsuffering humanity. We must fight that.
<br> Q. (recovering somewhat) You contradict yourself. You said earlier that youcould not prevent the&nbsp; destruction of Trantor; hence, presumably, the fall;杢he so-called fall of the Empire.
<br> A. I&nbsp; do not say now&nbsp; that we can prevent&nbsp; the fall. But it&nbsp; is not yet toolate&nbsp; to&nbsp; shorten&nbsp; the&nbsp; interregnum&nbsp; which&nbsp; will follow.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; possible,gentlemen, to reduce the&nbsp; duration of anarchy to a single millennium, if mygroup is&nbsp; allowed to act now.&nbsp; We are at a&nbsp; delicate moment in history. Thehuge, onrushing&nbsp; mass of events must&nbsp; be deflected just a&nbsp; little, ?just alittle&nbsp; ?It cannot&nbsp; be much, but&nbsp; it may&nbsp; be enough to&nbsp; remove twenty-ninethousand years of misery from human history.
<br> Q. How do you propose to do this?
<br> A. By saving the&nbsp; knowledge of the race. The sum of human knowing is beyondany one&nbsp; man; any thousand men. With the&nbsp; destruction of our social fabric,science will be broken into a million pieces. Individuals will know much ofexceedingly tiny facets of what there is to know. They will be helpless anduseless by&nbsp; themselves. The bits&nbsp; of lore, meaningless, will&nbsp; not be passedon. They&nbsp; will be&nbsp; lost through the&nbsp; generations. But, if we&nbsp; now prepare agiant summary&nbsp; of all knowledge, it will&nbsp; never be lost. Coming generationswill build&nbsp; on it, and will&nbsp; not have to rediscover&nbsp; it for themselves. Onemillennium will do the work of thirty thousand.
<br> Q. All thisA. All&nbsp; my project; my thirty&nbsp; thousand men with their&nbsp; wives and children,are devoting themselves to&nbsp; the preparation of an "Encyclopedia Galactica."They will&nbsp; not complete it in their lifetimes. I will&nbsp; not even live to seeit fairly&nbsp; begun. But&nbsp; by the time&nbsp; Trantor falls, it will&nbsp; be complete andcopies will exist in every major library in the Galaxy.
<br> The Chief&nbsp; Commissioner's gavel rose&nbsp; and fell. Hari Seldon&nbsp; left the standand quietly took his seat next to Gaal.
<br> He smiled and said, "How did you like the show?"Gaal said, "You stole it. But what will happen now?""They'll adjourn the trial and try to come to a private agreement with me.""How do you know?"Seldon&nbsp; said,&nbsp; "I'll be&nbsp; honest.&nbsp; I don't&nbsp; know.&nbsp; It depends&nbsp; on the&nbsp; ChiefCommissioner. I&nbsp; have studied&nbsp; him for years.&nbsp; I have tried&nbsp; to analyze hisworkings,&nbsp; but you know&nbsp; how risky it&nbsp; is to&nbsp; introduce the vagaries&nbsp; of anindividual&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; psychohistoric&nbsp;&nbsp; equations.&nbsp; Yet&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp; have&nbsp;&nbsp; hopes."
