There was&nbsp; the far-off hiss of theatmosphere cutting&nbsp; and sliding past the&nbsp; metal of the ship.&nbsp; There was thesteady drone&nbsp; of the&nbsp; conditioners fighting the&nbsp; heat of friction,&nbsp; and theslower rumble&nbsp; of the&nbsp; engines enforcing deceleration. There&nbsp; was the humansound of men and&nbsp; women gathering in the debarkation rooms and the grind ofthe hoists lifting baggage, mail, and freight to the long axis of the ship,from&nbsp; which they&nbsp; would&nbsp; be later&nbsp; moved along&nbsp; to the&nbsp; unloading platform.
<br> Gaal&nbsp; felt&nbsp; the&nbsp; slight&nbsp; jar that&nbsp; indicated&nbsp; the&nbsp; ship&nbsp; no&nbsp; longer had&nbsp; anindependent&nbsp; motion of&nbsp; its&nbsp; own. Ship's&nbsp; gravity&nbsp; had been&nbsp; giving way&nbsp; toplanetary&nbsp; gravity&nbsp; for hours.&nbsp; Thousands&nbsp; of passengers&nbsp; had been&nbsp; sittingpatiently&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; debarkation&nbsp;&nbsp; rooms&nbsp; which&nbsp; swung&nbsp; easily&nbsp; on&nbsp; yieldingforce-fields to&nbsp; accommodate its&nbsp; orientation to the&nbsp; changing direction ofthe gravitational forces. Now&nbsp; they were crawling down curving ramps to thelarge, yawning locks.
<br> Gaal's&nbsp; baggage was&nbsp; minor.&nbsp; He stood&nbsp; at a&nbsp; desk,&nbsp; as it&nbsp; was&nbsp; quickly andexpertly taken&nbsp; apart and&nbsp; put together again.&nbsp; His visa was&nbsp; inspected andstamped. He himself paid no attention.
<br> This was&nbsp; Trantor! The air seemed a little thicker&nbsp; here, the gravity a bitgreater, than on his&nbsp; home planet of Synnax, but he would get used to that.
<br> He wondered if he would get used to immensity.
<br> Debarkation&nbsp; Building&nbsp; was tremendous.&nbsp; The&nbsp; roof&nbsp; was almost&nbsp; lost in&nbsp; theheights.&nbsp; Gaal could&nbsp; almost&nbsp; imagine that&nbsp; clouds could&nbsp; form&nbsp; beneath itsimmensity. He could see no opposite wall; just men and desks and convergingfloor till it faded out in haze.
<br> The man at the&nbsp; desk was speaking again. He sounded annoyed. He said, "Moveon, Dornick." He had to open the visa, look again, before he remembered thename.
<br> Gaal said, "Where?where?
<br> The man&nbsp; at the desk jerked&nbsp; a thumb, "Taxis to&nbsp; the right and third left."Gaal moved, seeing the&nbsp; glowing twists of air suspended high in nothingnessand reading, "TAXIS TO ALL POINTS."A figure&nbsp; detached itself from anonymity&nbsp; and stopped at the&nbsp; desk, as Gaalleft. The&nbsp; man at the desk looked up and&nbsp; nodded briefly. The figure noddedin return and followed the young immigrant.
<br> He was in time to hear Gaal's destination.
<br> Gaal found himself hard against a railing.
<br> The small&nbsp; sign said, "Supervisor." The&nbsp; man to whom the&nbsp; sign referred didnot look up. He said, "Where to?"Gaal wasn't&nbsp; sure, but even a&nbsp; few seconds hesitation meant&nbsp; men queuing inline behind him.
<br> The Supervisor looked up, "Where to?"Gaal's funds were low,&nbsp; but there was only this one night and then he wouldhave&nbsp; a&nbsp; job.&nbsp; He&nbsp; tried&nbsp; to&nbsp; sound&nbsp; nonchalant, "A&nbsp; good&nbsp; hotel,&nbsp; please."The&nbsp;&nbsp; Supervisor&nbsp;&nbsp; was&nbsp; unimpressed,&nbsp;&nbsp; "They're&nbsp;&nbsp; all&nbsp;&nbsp; good.&nbsp; Name&nbsp;&nbsp; one."Gaal said, desperately, "The nearest one, please."The&nbsp; Supervisor touched&nbsp; a button. A&nbsp; thin line&nbsp; of light formed&nbsp; along thefloor,&nbsp; twisting&nbsp; among others&nbsp; which&nbsp; brightened and&nbsp; dimmed in&nbsp; differentcolors&nbsp; and&nbsp; shades. A&nbsp; ticket&nbsp; was&nbsp; shoved into&nbsp; Gaal's&nbsp; hands. It&nbsp; glowedfaintly.
<br> The Supervisor said, "One point twelve."Gaal fumbled for the coins. He said, "Where do I go?""Follow the&nbsp; light. The ticket will keep glowing&nbsp; as long as you're pointedin the tight direction."Gaal looked&nbsp; up and began walking. There&nbsp; were hundreds creeping across thevast&nbsp; floor,&nbsp; following&nbsp; their&nbsp; individual trails,&nbsp; sifting&nbsp; and&nbsp; strainingthemselves&nbsp; through&nbsp; intersection&nbsp; points&nbsp; to arrive&nbsp; at&nbsp; their&nbsp; respectivedestinations.
<br> His own trail ended.&nbsp; A man in glaring blue and yellow uniform, shining andnew&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; unstainable&nbsp;&nbsp; plasto-textile,&nbsp;&nbsp; reached&nbsp; for&nbsp;&nbsp; his&nbsp;&nbsp; two&nbsp;&nbsp; bags.
<br> "Direct line to the Luxor," he said.
<br> The man&nbsp; who followed Gaal heard that. He also&nbsp; heard Gaal say, "Fine," andwatched him enter the blunt-nosed vehicle.
<br> The&nbsp; taxi&nbsp; lifted straight&nbsp; up.&nbsp; Gaal&nbsp; stared out&nbsp; the curved,&nbsp; transparentwindow,&nbsp; marvelling&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp; sensation&nbsp; of airflight&nbsp; within&nbsp; an&nbsp; enclosedstructure and clutching instinctively at the back of the driver's seat. Thevastness contracted and the&nbsp; people became ants in random distribution. Thescene contracted further and began to slide backward.
<br> There was a wall ahead. It began high in the air and extended upward out ofsight. It&nbsp; was riddled with holes&nbsp; that were the mouths&nbsp; of tunnels. Gaal'staxi moved&nbsp; toward one&nbsp; then plunged into&nbsp; it. For a&nbsp; moment, Gaal wonderedidly how his driver could pick out one among so many.
<br> There&nbsp; was now&nbsp; only&nbsp; blackness, with&nbsp; nothing but&nbsp; the past-flashing&nbsp; of acolored signal&nbsp; light to relieve the&nbsp; gloom. The air was&nbsp; full of a rushingsound.
<br> Gaal leaned&nbsp; forward against deceleration&nbsp; then and the taxi&nbsp; popped out ofthe tunnel and descended to ground-level once more.
<br> "The Luxor Hotel," said&nbsp; the driver, unnecessarily. He helped Gaal with hisbaggage, accepted&nbsp; a tenth-credit tip with a&nbsp; businesslike air, picked up awaiting passenger, and was rising again.
<br> In all&nbsp; this, from the moment of debarkation, there&nbsp; had been no glimpse ofsky.
