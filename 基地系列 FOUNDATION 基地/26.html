Yet&nbsp; the mayor had a perfectly definite idea thatat least&nbsp; one other, and possibly two or three, had&nbsp; been held, to which hehad somehow never received an invitation.
<br> Nor, it seemed to&nbsp; him, would he have received notification of this one hadit not been for the ultimatum.
<br> At least, it amounted&nbsp; to an ultimatum, though a superficial reading of thevisigraphed&nbsp; document would&nbsp; lead&nbsp; one to&nbsp; suppose that&nbsp; it was&nbsp; a friendlyinterchange of greetings between two potentates.
<br> Hardin fingered it gingerly. It started off floridly with a salutation from"His Puissant Majesty, the King of Anacreon, to his friend and brother, Dr.
<br> Lewis&nbsp; Pirenne, Chairman&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Board&nbsp; of Trustees,&nbsp; of&nbsp; the EncyclopediaFoundation Number&nbsp; One," and it&nbsp; ended even more lavishly&nbsp; with a gigantic,multicolored seal of the most involved symbolism.
<br> But it was an ultimatum just the same.
<br> Hardin said: "It turned&nbsp; out that we didn't have much time after all ?onlythree months.&nbsp; But little&nbsp; as it was,&nbsp; we threw it away&nbsp; unused. This thinghere gives us a week. What do we do now?"Pirenne&nbsp; frowned worriedly.&nbsp; "There must&nbsp; be a&nbsp; loophole. It&nbsp; is absolutelyunbelievable that&nbsp; they would&nbsp; push matters to&nbsp; extremities in the&nbsp; face ofwhat Lord&nbsp; Dorwin has assured us regarding the&nbsp; attitude of the Emperor andthe Empire."Hardin perked&nbsp; up. "I see. You&nbsp; have informed the King&nbsp; of Anacreon of thisalleged attitude?""I&nbsp; did ? after having&nbsp; placed the proposal&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Board for a&nbsp; vote andhaving received unanimous consent.""And when did this vote take place?"Pirenne climbed onto his&nbsp; dignity. "I do not believe I am answerable to youin any way, Mayor Hardin.""All right.&nbsp; I'm not that vitally interested. It's&nbsp; just my opinion that itwas your diplomatic transmission&nbsp; of Lord Dorwin's valuable contribution tothe&nbsp; situation"?he&nbsp; lifted the&nbsp; comer of&nbsp; his mouth&nbsp; in a&nbsp; sour half-smile?that was&nbsp; the direct cause of this friendly&nbsp; little note. They might havedelayed longer&nbsp; otherwise ?though I don't&nbsp; think the additional time wouldhave&nbsp; helped&nbsp; Terminus&nbsp; any,&nbsp;&nbsp; considering&nbsp; the&nbsp; attitude&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Board."Said&nbsp; Yate&nbsp; Fulham:&nbsp; "And&nbsp; just&nbsp; how&nbsp; do&nbsp; you&nbsp; arrive&nbsp; at&nbsp; that&nbsp; remarkableconclusion, Mr. Mayor?""In a rather simple&nbsp; way. It merely required the use of that much-neglectedcommodity ? common sense.&nbsp; You see, there&nbsp; is a branch&nbsp; of human knowledgeknown&nbsp; as symbolic&nbsp; logic, which&nbsp; can be&nbsp; used to&nbsp; prune away all&nbsp; sorts ofclogging deadwood that clutters up human language.""What about it?" said Fulham.
<br> "I applied&nbsp; it. Among other things,&nbsp; I applied it to&nbsp; this document here. Ididn't really need to&nbsp; for myself because I knew what it was all about, butI think I can explain it more easily to five physical scientists by symbolsrather than by words."Hardin removed a few&nbsp; sheets of paper from the pad under his arm and spreadthem out.&nbsp; "I didn't do this myself, by the way,"&nbsp; he said. "Muller Holk ofthe Division of Logic has his name signed to the analyses, as you can see."Pirenne leaned&nbsp; over the table to&nbsp; get a better view&nbsp; and Hardin continued:
<br> "The message from Anacreon was a simple problem, naturally, for the men whowrote it were men&nbsp; of action rather than men of words. It boils down easilyand straightforwardly to the unqualified statement, when in symbols is whatyou see,&nbsp; and which in words, roughly translated, is,&nbsp; 'You give us what wewant in a week, or we take it by force.'"There was&nbsp; silence as&nbsp; the five members of&nbsp; the Board ran down&nbsp; the line ofsymbols, and then Pirenne sat down and coughed uneasily.
<br> Hardin said, "No loophole, is there, Dr. Pirenne?""Doesn't seem to be.""All right." Hardin replaced&nbsp; the sheets. "Before you now you see a copy ofthe treaty between the&nbsp; Empire and Anacreon ?a treaty, incidentally, whichis signed on the Emperor's behalf by the same Lord Dorwin who was here lastweek ?and with it a symbolic analysis."The&nbsp; treaty ran&nbsp; through&nbsp; five pages&nbsp; of fine&nbsp; print&nbsp; and the&nbsp; analysis wasscrawled out in just under half a page.
<br> "As you see, gentlemen,&nbsp; something like ninety percent of the treaty boiledright out of the analysis as being meaningless, and what we end up with canbe described in the following interesting manner:
<br> "Obligations of Anacreon to the Empire: None!
<br> "Powers of the Empire over Anacreon: None!"Again the five followed the reasoning anxiously, checking carefully back tothe treaty, and when they were finished, Pirenne said in a worried fashion,"That seems to be correct.""You admit,&nbsp; then, that&nbsp; the treaty is&nbsp; nothing but a&nbsp; declaration of totalindependence on&nbsp; the part of Anacreon&nbsp; and a recognition of&nbsp; that status bythe Empire?""It seems so.""And do you suppose&nbsp; that Anacreon doesn't realize that, and is not anxiousto emphasize the position of independence ?so that it would naturally tendto resent&nbsp; any appearance of threats from&nbsp; the Empire? Particularly when itis evident that the&nbsp; Empire is powerless to fulfill any such threats, or itwould never have allowed independence.""But&nbsp; then," interposed&nbsp; Sutt,&nbsp; "how would&nbsp; Mayor Hardin&nbsp; account&nbsp; for LordDorwin's assurances&nbsp; of Empire support? They&nbsp; seemed ? He shrugged. "Well,they seemed satisfactory."Hardin&nbsp; threw&nbsp; himself&nbsp; back&nbsp; in the&nbsp; chair.&nbsp; "You&nbsp; know,&nbsp; that's the&nbsp; mostinteresting&nbsp; part of&nbsp; the&nbsp; whole business.&nbsp; I'll&nbsp; admit I&nbsp; had thought&nbsp; hisLordship a most consummate&nbsp; donkey when I first met him ?but it turned outthat he was actually an accomplished diplomat and a most clever man. I tookthe liberty of recording all his statements."There&nbsp;&nbsp; was&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; flurry,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; Pirenne&nbsp;&nbsp; opened&nbsp; his&nbsp;&nbsp; mouth&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; horror.
<br> "What&nbsp; of&nbsp; it?" demanded&nbsp; Hardin.&nbsp; "I&nbsp; realize it&nbsp; was&nbsp; a&nbsp; gross breach&nbsp; ofhospitality and a thing&nbsp; no so-called gentleman would do. Also, that if hislordship had&nbsp; caught on, things might have&nbsp; been unpleasant; but he didn't,and I&nbsp; have the record, and that's that. I took&nbsp; that record, had it copiedout and sent that to Holk for analysis, also."Lundin Crast said, "And where is the analysis?""That,"&nbsp; replied Hardin, "is&nbsp; the interesting&nbsp; thing. The analysis&nbsp; was themost&nbsp; difficult of&nbsp; the three&nbsp; by all&nbsp; odds. When&nbsp; Holk, after two&nbsp; days ofsteady&nbsp; work,&nbsp; succeeded&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; eliminating&nbsp; meaningless&nbsp; statements,&nbsp; vaguegibberish, useless qualifications ? in short, all the goo and dribble ?hefound he had nothing left. Everything canceled out.""Lord Dorwin,&nbsp; gentlemen, in five days of discussion didn't&nbsp; say one damnedthing, and said&nbsp; it so you never noticed. There&nbsp; are the assurances you hadfrom your precious Empire."Hardin might&nbsp; have placed an actively working stench&nbsp; bomb on the table andcreated no more confusion than existed after his last statement. He waited,with weary patience, for it to die down.
<br> "So," he&nbsp; concluded, "when you sent&nbsp; threats ?and that's&nbsp; what they were ?
<br> concerning Empire&nbsp; action to&nbsp; Anacreon, you merely irritated&nbsp; a monarch whoknew&nbsp; better. Naturally,&nbsp; his ego&nbsp; would demand&nbsp; immediate action,&nbsp; and theultimatum is&nbsp; the result-which brings me to&nbsp; my original statement. We haveone week left and what do we do now?""It seems,"&nbsp; said Sutt,&nbsp; "that we have&nbsp; no choice but to&nbsp; allow Anacreon toestablish military bases on Terminus.""I agree with you there," replied Hardin, "but what do we do toward kickingthem off again at the first opportunity?"Yate Fulham's&nbsp; mustache twitched. "That sounds as if&nbsp; you have made up yourmind that violence must be used against them.""Violence," came the retort,&nbsp; "is the last refuge of the incompetent. But Icertainly don't&nbsp; intend to lay down the welcome mat&nbsp; and brush off the bestfurniture for their use.""I&nbsp; still don't&nbsp; like&nbsp; the way&nbsp; you put&nbsp; that," insisted&nbsp; Fulham. "It&nbsp; is adangerous attitude; the more&nbsp; dangerous because we have noticed lately thata sizable section of&nbsp; the populace seems to respond to all your suggestionsjust so.&nbsp; I might&nbsp; as well tell&nbsp; you, Mayor Hardin,&nbsp; that the&nbsp; board is notquite blind to your recent activities."He&nbsp;&nbsp; paused&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; there&nbsp;&nbsp; was&nbsp;&nbsp; general&nbsp;&nbsp; agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hardin&nbsp;&nbsp; shrugged.
<br> Fulham went&nbsp; on: "If you were to inflame the City&nbsp; into an act of violence,you would&nbsp; achieve elaborate suicide ? and we don't intend&nbsp; to allow that.
<br> Our policy&nbsp; has but one&nbsp; cardinal principle, and that&nbsp; is the Encyclopedia.
<br> Whatever we decide to do or not to do will be so decided because it will bethe measure required to keep that Encyclopedia safe.""Then," said Hardin, "you&nbsp; come to the conclusion that we must continue ourintensive campaign of doing nothing."Pirenne&nbsp; said bitterly:&nbsp; "You&nbsp; have yourself&nbsp; demonstrated that&nbsp; the Empirecannot help&nbsp; us; though&nbsp; how and why it&nbsp; can be so, I&nbsp; don't understand. Ifcompromise is necessary?
<br> Hardin had the nightmarelike&nbsp; sensation of running at top speed and gettingnowhere. "There&nbsp; is no compromise!&nbsp; Don't you realize that&nbsp; this bosh aboutmilitary bases is a particularly inferior grade of drivel? Haut Rodric toldus what Anacreon was&nbsp; after ?outright annexation and imposition of its ownfeudal system&nbsp; of landed&nbsp; estates and peasant-aristocracy&nbsp; economy upon us.
<br> What is&nbsp; left of our bluff of nuclear power may&nbsp; force them to move slowly,but they will move nonetheless."He had risen indignantly,&nbsp; and the rest rose with him except for Jord Fara.
<br> And then Jord Fara&nbsp; spoke. "Everyone will please sit down. We've gone quitefar enough, I think. Come, there's no use looking so furious, Mayor Hardin;none of us have been committing treason.""You'll have to convince me of that!"Fara&nbsp; smiled&nbsp; gently.&nbsp; "You&nbsp; know&nbsp; you&nbsp; don't&nbsp; mean that.&nbsp; Let&nbsp; me&nbsp; speak!"His little&nbsp; shrewd eyes were&nbsp; half closed, and the&nbsp; perspiration gleamed onthe smooth&nbsp; expanse of his chin.&nbsp; "There seems no point&nbsp; in concealing thatthe&nbsp; Board&nbsp; has&nbsp; come&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; that&nbsp; the real&nbsp; solution&nbsp; to&nbsp; theAnacreonian problem&nbsp; lies in&nbsp; what is to&nbsp; be revealed to us&nbsp; when the Vaultopens six days from now.""Is that your contribution to the matter?""Yes.""We are to do&nbsp; nothing, is that fight, except to wait in quiet serenity andutter faith for the deus ex machina to pop out of the Vault?""Stripped&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; your&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; emotional&nbsp;&nbsp; phraseology,&nbsp;&nbsp; that's&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; idea.""Such unsubtle&nbsp; escapism! Really, Dr. Fara, such&nbsp; folly smacks of genius. Alesser mind would be incapable of it."Fara smiled&nbsp; indulgently. "Your&nbsp; taste in epigrams is&nbsp; amusing, Hardin, butout of place. As a matter of fact, I think you remember my line of argumentconcerning the Vault about three weeks ago.""Yes, I&nbsp; remember it. I don't&nbsp; deny that it was&nbsp; anything but a stupid ideafrom the&nbsp; standpoint of&nbsp; deductive logic alone.&nbsp; You said ?stop&nbsp; me when Imake&nbsp; a mistake&nbsp; ?that Hari&nbsp; Seldon was&nbsp; the greatest psychologist&nbsp; in theSystem;&nbsp; that, hence,&nbsp; he could&nbsp; foresee the&nbsp; right and&nbsp; uncomfortable spotwe're in now; that,&nbsp; hence, he established the Vault as a method of tellingus the way out.""You've got the essence of the idea.""Would it surprise you&nbsp; to hear that I've given considerable thought to thematter these last weeks?""Very flattering. With what result?""With the result that pure deduction is found wanting. Again what is neededis a little sprinkling of common sense.""For instance?""For instance,&nbsp; if he foresaw the Anacreonian mess,&nbsp; why not have placed uson&nbsp; some other&nbsp; planet nearer&nbsp; the Galactic&nbsp; centers? It's well&nbsp; known thatSeldon maneuvered the Commissioners on Trantor into ordering the Foundationestablished on&nbsp; Terminus. But&nbsp; why should he&nbsp; have done so? Why&nbsp; put us outhere at&nbsp; all if he could&nbsp; see in advance the&nbsp; break in communication lines,our&nbsp; isolation from&nbsp; the&nbsp; Galaxy, the&nbsp; threat of&nbsp; our&nbsp; neighbors ? and ourhelplessness because of the&nbsp; lack of metals on Terminus? That above all! Orif&nbsp; he foresaw&nbsp; all&nbsp; this, why&nbsp; not have&nbsp; warned&nbsp; the original&nbsp; settlers inadvance that&nbsp; they might have had time to prepare,&nbsp; rather than wait, as heis&nbsp; doing,&nbsp;&nbsp; until&nbsp; one&nbsp;&nbsp; foot&nbsp; is&nbsp; over&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; cliff,&nbsp; before&nbsp;&nbsp; doing&nbsp; so?
<br> "And don't&nbsp; forget this. Even though he could foresee the&nbsp; problem then, wecan see&nbsp; it equally well&nbsp; now. Therefore, if he&nbsp; could foresee the solutionthen,&nbsp; we&nbsp; should&nbsp; be able&nbsp; to see&nbsp; it&nbsp; now.&nbsp; After all,&nbsp; Seldon was&nbsp; not amagician. There are no trick methods of escaping from a dilemma that he cansee and we can't.""But, Hardin," reminded Fara, "we can't!""But you haven't tried. You haven't tried once. First, you refused to admitthat there was a&nbsp; menace at all! Then you reposed an absolutely blind faithin the&nbsp; Emperor! Now you've shifted it to&nbsp; Hari Seldon. Throughout you haveinvariably&nbsp; relied on&nbsp; authority&nbsp; or on&nbsp; the past&nbsp; ?never&nbsp; on yourselves."His&nbsp; fists balled&nbsp; spasmodically. "It&nbsp; amounts to&nbsp; a diseased attitude&nbsp; ?aconditioned&nbsp; reflex&nbsp; that&nbsp; shunts&nbsp; aside&nbsp; the independence&nbsp; of&nbsp; your&nbsp; mindswhenever it is a&nbsp; question of opposing authority. There seems no doubt everin&nbsp; your minds&nbsp; that the&nbsp; Emperor is&nbsp; more powerful&nbsp; than you are,&nbsp; or HariSeldon wiser. And that's wrong, don't you see?"For some reason, no one cared to answer him.
<br> Hardin continued: "It isn't&nbsp; just you. It's the whole Galaxy. Pirenne heardLord Dorwin's&nbsp; idea of scientific research. Lord&nbsp; Dorwin thought the way tobe a good archaeologist&nbsp; was to read all the books on the subject ?writtenby&nbsp; men who&nbsp; were&nbsp; dead for&nbsp; centuries. He&nbsp; thought that&nbsp; the way&nbsp; to solvearchaeological puzzles&nbsp; was to weigh the&nbsp; opposing authorities. And Pirennelistened and made no objections. Don't you see that there's something wrongwith that?"Again&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; note&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; near-pleading&nbsp; in&nbsp; his&nbsp; voice.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again&nbsp; no&nbsp; answer.
<br> He went on: "And&nbsp; you men and half of Terminus as well&nbsp; are just as bad. Wesit&nbsp; here, considering&nbsp; the&nbsp; Encyclopedia the&nbsp; all-in-all. We&nbsp; consider thegreatest&nbsp; end&nbsp; of&nbsp; science.&nbsp; is the&nbsp; classification&nbsp; of&nbsp; past&nbsp; data. It&nbsp; isimportant,&nbsp; but is&nbsp; there no further&nbsp; work to&nbsp; be done? We're&nbsp; receding andforgetting,&nbsp; don't you&nbsp; see?&nbsp; Here in&nbsp; the Periphery&nbsp; they've&nbsp; lost nuclearpower. In Gamma Andromeda,&nbsp; a power plant has undergone meltdown because ofpoor&nbsp; repairs, and&nbsp; the&nbsp; Chancellor of&nbsp; the Empire&nbsp; complains&nbsp; that nucleartechnicians are scarce. And the solution? To train new ones? Never! Insteadthey're to restrict nuclear power."And for the third&nbsp; time: "Don't you see? It's Galaxywide. It's a worship ofthe past. It's a deterioration ?a stagnation!"He&nbsp; stared&nbsp; from&nbsp; one&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; other&nbsp; and&nbsp; they&nbsp; gazed&nbsp; fixedly&nbsp; at&nbsp; him.
<br> Fara was&nbsp; the first to&nbsp; recover. "Well, mystical philosophy&nbsp; isn't going tohelp us here. Let us be concrete. Do you deny that Hari Seldon could easilyhave&nbsp; worked out historical&nbsp; trends of&nbsp; the future by&nbsp; simple psychologicaltechnique?""No,&nbsp; of&nbsp; course not,"&nbsp; cried&nbsp; Hardin.&nbsp; "But we&nbsp; can't&nbsp; rely on&nbsp; him for&nbsp; asolution. At&nbsp; best, he might indicate the problem, but&nbsp; if ever there is tobe&nbsp; a solution,&nbsp; we must&nbsp; work it out&nbsp; ourselves. He&nbsp; can't do it&nbsp; for us."Fulham spoke suddenly. "What&nbsp; do you mean ?'indicate the problem'? We knowthe problem."Hardin whirled&nbsp; on him. "You think&nbsp; you do? You think&nbsp; Anacreon is all HariSeldon is&nbsp; likely to be worried&nbsp; about. I disagree! I&nbsp; tell you, gentlemen,that as yet none of you has the faintest conception of what is really goingon.""And you do?" questioned Pirenne, hostilely.
<br> "I think&nbsp; so!" Hardin&nbsp; jumped up and&nbsp; pushed his chair away.&nbsp; His eyes werecold and&nbsp; hard. "If there's one&nbsp; thing that's definite, it&nbsp; is that there'ssomething smelly&nbsp; about the whole situation;&nbsp; something that is bigger thananything we've&nbsp; talked about yet. Just ask&nbsp; yourself this question: Why wasit that among the original population of the Foundation not one first-classpsychologist was&nbsp; included, except Bor&nbsp; Alurin? And he&nbsp; carefully refrainedfrom training his pupils in more than the fundamentals."A short silence and Fara said: "All right. Why?""Perhaps because&nbsp; a psychologist might have caught on&nbsp; to what this was allabout ? and too soon to&nbsp; suit Hari Seldon. As&nbsp; it is, we've been stumblingabout, getting&nbsp; misty glimpses of the&nbsp; truth and no more.&nbsp; And that is whatHari Seldon wanted."He laughed harshly. "Good day, gentlemen!"He stalked out of the room.
