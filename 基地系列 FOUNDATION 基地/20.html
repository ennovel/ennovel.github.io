<br> With a&nbsp; tight smile and a low bow, the&nbsp; sub-prefect had flipped his blasterfrom its holster and presented it to Hardin butt first. Hardin returned thecompliment&nbsp; with,&nbsp; a&nbsp; blaster&nbsp;&nbsp; specifically&nbsp; borrowed&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; occasion.
<br> Friendship and&nbsp; good will&nbsp; were thus established,&nbsp; and if Hardin&nbsp; noted thebarest&nbsp; bulge&nbsp; at&nbsp; Haut&nbsp; Rodric's&nbsp; shoulder,&nbsp; he&nbsp; prudently&nbsp; said&nbsp; nothing.
<br> The ground car that received them then ?preceded, flanked, and followed bythe&nbsp; suitable&nbsp; cloud&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; minor&nbsp; functionaries&nbsp; ? proceeded&nbsp; in&nbsp; a&nbsp; slow,ceremonious manner&nbsp; to Cyclopedia Square, cheered on&nbsp; its way by a properlyenthusiastic crowd.
<br> Sub-prefect Anselm received the cheers with the complaisant indifference ofa soldier and a nobleman.
<br> He said to Hardin, "And this city is all your world?"Hardin&nbsp; raised his&nbsp; voice to&nbsp; be heard&nbsp; above the&nbsp; clamor. "We are&nbsp; a youngworld, your&nbsp; eminence. In our short history we have&nbsp; had but few members ofthe&nbsp; higher&nbsp; nobility visiting&nbsp; our&nbsp; poor planet.&nbsp; Hence, our&nbsp; enthusiasm."It is certain that&nbsp; "higher nobility" did not recognize irony when he heardit.
<br> He said&nbsp; thoughtfully: "Founded fifty&nbsp; years ago. Hm-mmm! You&nbsp; have a greatdeal of unexploited land here, mayor. You have never considered dividing itinto estates?""There is no necessity&nbsp; as yet. We're extremely centralized; we have to be,because&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Encyclopedia.&nbsp; Someday, perhaps,&nbsp; when our&nbsp; population hasgrown?
<br> "A strange world! You have no peasantry?"Hardin reflected that it didn't require a great deal of acumen to tell thathis eminence&nbsp; was indulging in a&nbsp; bit of fairly clumsy&nbsp; pumping. He repliedcasually, "No ?nor nobility."Haut Rodric's&nbsp; eyebrows lifted. "And your&nbsp; leader ?the man&nbsp; I am to meet?""You mean&nbsp; Dr. Pirenne? Yes! He is the Chairman of&nbsp; the Board of Trustees ?
<br> and a personal representative of the Emperor.""Doctor?&nbsp; No&nbsp; other&nbsp; title?&nbsp; A&nbsp; scholar?&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; he&nbsp; rates&nbsp; above the&nbsp; civilauthority?""Why,&nbsp; certainly," replied&nbsp; Hardin,&nbsp; amiably. "We're&nbsp; all scholars&nbsp; more orless. After&nbsp; all, we're&nbsp; not so much&nbsp; a world as a&nbsp; scientific foundation ?
<br> under the direct control of the Emperor."There was&nbsp; a faint emphasis upon the last&nbsp; phrase that seemed to disconcertthe&nbsp; sub-prefect. He remained&nbsp; thoughtfully silent&nbsp; during the rest&nbsp; of theslow way to Cyclopedia Square.
<br> If Hardin&nbsp; found himself bored by the&nbsp; afternoon and evening that followed,he had at least&nbsp; the satisfaction of realizing that Pirenne and Haut Rodric?having met with loud and mutual protestations of esteem and regard ?weredetesting each other's company a good deal more.
<br> Haut Rodric&nbsp; had attended with&nbsp; glazed eye to Pirenne's&nbsp; lecture during the"inspection&nbsp; tour" of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Encyclopedia Building.&nbsp; With polite&nbsp; and vacantsmile, he had listened&nbsp; to the latter's rapid patter as they passed throughthe vast storehouses of&nbsp; reference films and the numerous projection rooms.
<br> It was&nbsp; only after&nbsp; he had gone&nbsp; down level by&nbsp; level into&nbsp; and through thecomposing&nbsp; departments,&nbsp; editing departments,&nbsp; publishing departments,&nbsp; andfilming&nbsp; departments&nbsp; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; made&nbsp; the&nbsp; first&nbsp; comprehensive&nbsp; statement.
<br> "This is all very interesting," he said, "but it seems a strange occupationfor grown men. What good is it?"It was&nbsp; a remark, Hardin noted,&nbsp; for which Pirenne found&nbsp; no answer, thoughthe expression of his face was most eloquent.
<br> The dinner&nbsp; that evening&nbsp; was much the&nbsp; mirror image of the&nbsp; events of thatafternoon, for Haut Rodric&nbsp; monopolized the conversation by describing ?inminute&nbsp; technical detail&nbsp; and with&nbsp; incredible zest&nbsp; ?his own&nbsp; exploits asbattalion head&nbsp; during the recent war&nbsp; between Anacreon and the neighboringnewly proclaimed Kingdom of Smyrno.
<br> The details&nbsp; of the&nbsp; sub-prefect's account were not&nbsp; completed until dinnerwas over and one&nbsp; by one the minor officials had drifted away. The last bitof&nbsp; triumphant&nbsp;&nbsp; description&nbsp; of&nbsp; mangled&nbsp; spaceships&nbsp;&nbsp; came&nbsp; when&nbsp; he&nbsp; hadaccompanied Pirenne and Hardin onto the balcony and relaxed in the warm airof the summer evening.
<br> "And&nbsp; now,"&nbsp; he&nbsp; said,&nbsp; with&nbsp; a&nbsp; heavy&nbsp; joviality,&nbsp; "to&nbsp; serious&nbsp; matters.""By all&nbsp; means," murmured Hardin, lighting a long&nbsp; cigar of Vegan tobacco ?
<br> not many&nbsp; left, he&nbsp; reflected ?and&nbsp; teetering his chair back&nbsp; on two legs.
<br> The Galaxy&nbsp; was high in the&nbsp; sky and its misty&nbsp; lens shape stretched lazilyfrom&nbsp; horizon to&nbsp; horizon.&nbsp; The few&nbsp; stars here&nbsp; at&nbsp; the very&nbsp; edge&nbsp; of theuniverse were insignificant twinkles in comparison.
<br> "Of course," said the&nbsp; sub-prefect, "all the formal discussions ?the papersigning and such dull&nbsp; technicalities, that is ?will take place before the?What is it you call your Council?""The Board of Trustees," replied Pirenne, coldly.
<br> "Queer name! Anyway, that's&nbsp; for tomorrow. We might as well clear away someof the underbrush, man to man, right now, though. Hey?""And this means? prodded Hardin.
<br> "Just this. There's been&nbsp; a certain change in the situation out here in thePeriphery and&nbsp; the status of your planet has&nbsp; become a trifle uncertain. Itwould be&nbsp; very convenient if we succeeded in&nbsp; coming to an understanding asto how the matter&nbsp; stands. By the way, mayor, have you another one of thosecigars?"Hardin started and produced one reluctantly.
<br> Anselm haut Rodric sniffed&nbsp; at it and emitted a clucking sound of pleasure.
<br> "Vegan tobacco! Where did you get it?""We received some last&nbsp; shipment. There's hardly any left. Space knows whenwe'll get more ?if ever."Pirenne scowled. He didn't smoke ?and, for that matter, detested the odor.
<br> "Let&nbsp; me understand&nbsp; this,&nbsp; your eminence.&nbsp; Your mission&nbsp; is merely&nbsp; one ofclarification?"Haut&nbsp; Rodric&nbsp;&nbsp; nodded&nbsp; through&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; smoke&nbsp; of&nbsp; his&nbsp;&nbsp; first&nbsp; lusty&nbsp; puffs.
<br> "In&nbsp; that&nbsp; case,&nbsp; it&nbsp; is soon&nbsp; over.&nbsp; The&nbsp; situation&nbsp; with&nbsp; respect to&nbsp; theEncyclopedia Foundation is what it always has been.""Ah! And what is it that it always has been?""Just&nbsp; this:&nbsp; A&nbsp; State-supported scientific&nbsp; institution&nbsp; and&nbsp; part of&nbsp; thepersonal domain of his august majesty, the Emperor."The&nbsp; sub-prefect seemed unimpressed.&nbsp; He blew&nbsp; smoke rings. "That's&nbsp; a nicetheory, Dr.&nbsp; Pirenne. I imagine you've got&nbsp; charters with the Imperial Sealupon it ?but what's the actual situation? How do you stand with respect toSmyrno? You're not fifty&nbsp; parsecs from Smyrno's capital. you know. And whatabout Konom and Daribow?"Pirenne&nbsp; said: "We&nbsp; have nothing&nbsp; to do&nbsp; with any&nbsp; prefect. As part&nbsp; of theEmperor's?
<br> "They're&nbsp; not&nbsp; prefects," reminded&nbsp; Haut&nbsp; Rodric;&nbsp; "they're kingdoms&nbsp; now.""Kingdoms&nbsp; then.&nbsp; We&nbsp; have&nbsp; nothing&nbsp; to&nbsp; do&nbsp; with&nbsp; them.&nbsp; As&nbsp; a&nbsp; scientificinstitution?
<br> "Science be&nbsp; damned!" swore the other.&nbsp; "What the devil has&nbsp; that got to dowith the fact that we're liable to see Terminus taken over by Smyrno at anytime?""And the Emperor? He would just sit by?"Haut Rodric calmed down&nbsp; and said: "Well, now, Dr. Pirenne, you respect theEmperor's property&nbsp; and so&nbsp; does Anacreon, but Smyrno&nbsp; might not. Remember,we've just&nbsp; signed a treaty with the Emperor ?I'll&nbsp; present a copy to thatBoard&nbsp; of yours&nbsp; tomorrow&nbsp; ?which&nbsp; places&nbsp; upon us&nbsp; the responsibility&nbsp; ofmaintaining&nbsp; order within&nbsp; the borders&nbsp; of the&nbsp; old Prefect of&nbsp; Anacreon onbehalf&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; Emperor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our&nbsp;&nbsp; duty&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; clear,&nbsp;&nbsp; then,&nbsp; isn't&nbsp;&nbsp; it?""Certainly.&nbsp; But&nbsp; Terminus&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; part&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Prefect&nbsp; of&nbsp; Anacreon.""And Smyrno?
<br> "Nor is&nbsp; it part of the&nbsp; Prefect of Smyrno. It's&nbsp; not part of any prefect.""Does Smyrno know that?""I don't care what it knows.""We do. We've just&nbsp; finished a war with her and she still holds two stellarsystems&nbsp; that&nbsp; are ours.&nbsp; Terminus&nbsp; occupies an&nbsp; extremely strategic&nbsp; spot,between the two nations."Hardin felt weary. He&nbsp; broke in: "What is your proposition, your eminence?"The sub-prefect seemed quite&nbsp; ready to stop fencing in favor of more directstatements.&nbsp; He&nbsp; said&nbsp; briskly: "It&nbsp; seems&nbsp; perfectly&nbsp; obvious that,&nbsp; sinceTerminus cannot defend itself,&nbsp; Anacreon must take over the job for its ownsake.&nbsp; You&nbsp; understand&nbsp; we&nbsp; have&nbsp; no&nbsp; desire&nbsp; to&nbsp; interfere&nbsp; with&nbsp; internaladministration?
<br> "Uh-huh," grunted Hardin dryly.
<br> "朾ut we&nbsp; believe that it would be best for&nbsp; all concerned to have Anacreonestablish a military base upon the planet.""And&nbsp; that is&nbsp; all you would&nbsp; want ?a&nbsp; military base&nbsp; in some of&nbsp; the vastunoccupied territory ?and let it go at that?""Well, of&nbsp; course, there would&nbsp; be the matter of&nbsp; supporting the protectingforces."Hardin's chair&nbsp; came down on all&nbsp; four, and his elbows&nbsp; went forward on hisknees. "Now we're getting&nbsp; to the nub. Let's put it into language. Terminusis to be a protectorate and to pay tribute.""Not&nbsp;&nbsp; tribute.&nbsp;&nbsp; Taxes.&nbsp;&nbsp; We're&nbsp; protecting&nbsp;&nbsp; you.&nbsp;&nbsp; You&nbsp;&nbsp; pay&nbsp; for&nbsp;&nbsp; it."Pirenne banged&nbsp; his hand on the chair with&nbsp; sudden violence. "Let me speak,Hardin. Your eminence, I&nbsp; don't care a rusty half-credit coin for Anacreon,Smyrno, or&nbsp; all your&nbsp; local politics and petty&nbsp; wars. I tell you&nbsp; this is aState-supported tax-free institution.""State-supported?&nbsp; But&nbsp; we&nbsp; are&nbsp; the&nbsp; State,&nbsp; Dr. Pirenne,&nbsp; and&nbsp; we're&nbsp; notsupporting."Pirenne rose angrily. "Your eminence, I am the direct representative of?
<br> "杊is&nbsp; august majesty,&nbsp; the Emperor,"&nbsp; chorused Anselm haut&nbsp; Rodric sourly,"And I am the&nbsp; direct representative of the King of Anacreon. Anacreon is alot nearer, Dr. Pirenne. ""Let's&nbsp; get back&nbsp; to&nbsp; business," urged&nbsp; Hardin. "How&nbsp; would you&nbsp; take theseso-called&nbsp; taxes,&nbsp; your&nbsp; eminence?&nbsp; Would you&nbsp; take&nbsp; them&nbsp; in kind:&nbsp; wheat,potatoes, vegetables, cattle?"The sub-prefect stared. "What&nbsp; the devil? What do we need with those? We'vegot hefty&nbsp; surpluses. Gold, of&nbsp; course. Chromium or vanadium&nbsp; would be evenbetter, incidentally, if you have it in quantity."Hardin&nbsp; laughed. "Quantity!&nbsp; We haven't&nbsp; even got&nbsp; iron in&nbsp; quantity. Gold!
<br> Here,&nbsp; take&nbsp; a look&nbsp; at&nbsp; our&nbsp; currency." He&nbsp; tossed&nbsp; a coin&nbsp; to the&nbsp; envoy.
<br> Haut Rodric bounced it and stared. "What is it? Steel?""That's right.""I don't understand.""Terminus&nbsp; is&nbsp; a&nbsp; planet&nbsp; practically without&nbsp; metals.&nbsp; We&nbsp; import it&nbsp; all.
<br> Consequently, we&nbsp; have no&nbsp; gold, and nothing&nbsp; to pay unless you&nbsp; want a fewthousand bushels of potatoes.""Well ?manufactured goods.""Without metal? What do we make our machines out of?"There was&nbsp; a pause and Pirenne tried again.&nbsp; "This whole discussion is wideof&nbsp; the&nbsp; point. Terminus&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; a planet,&nbsp; but&nbsp; a scientific&nbsp; foundationpreparing&nbsp; a&nbsp; great&nbsp; encyclopedia.&nbsp; Space, man,&nbsp; have&nbsp; you&nbsp; no respect&nbsp; forscience?""Encyclopedias don't win wars." Haut Rodric's brows furrowed. "A completelyunproductive world,&nbsp; then ? and practically unoccupied at&nbsp; that. Well, youmight pay with land.""What do you mean?" asked Pirenne.
<br> "This&nbsp; world&nbsp; is just&nbsp; about&nbsp; empty&nbsp; and the&nbsp; unoccupied&nbsp; land is&nbsp; probablyfertile.&nbsp; There are&nbsp; many of the&nbsp; nobility on&nbsp; Anacreon that would&nbsp; like anaddition to their estates.""You can't propose any such?
<br> "There's no&nbsp; necessity of&nbsp; looking so alarmed, Dr.&nbsp; Pirenne. There's plentyfor all of&nbsp; us. If it comes to what it comes,&nbsp; and you co-operate, we couldprobably arrange&nbsp; it so that you lose nothing.&nbsp; Titles can be conferred andestates granted. You understand me, I think."Pirenne sneered, "Thanks!"And then&nbsp; Hardin said ingenuously: "Could&nbsp; Anacreon supply us with adequatequantities&nbsp; of plutonium&nbsp; for&nbsp; our nuclear-power&nbsp; plant? We've&nbsp; only&nbsp; a fewyears' supply left."There was&nbsp; a gasp&nbsp; from Pirenne and&nbsp; then a dead silence&nbsp; for minutes. WhenHaut Rodric&nbsp; spoke it was in a voice quite different&nbsp; from what it had beentill then:
<br> "You have nuclear power?""Certainly.&nbsp; What's&nbsp; unusual in&nbsp; that?&nbsp; I&nbsp; imagine nuclear&nbsp; power is&nbsp; fiftythousand years old now. Why shouldn't we have it? Except that it's a littledifficult to get plutonium.""Yes ... Yes." The&nbsp; envoy paused and added uncomfortably: "Well, gentlemen,we'll pursue the subject tomorrow. You'll excuse me?
<br> Pirenne looked after him and gritted through his teeth: "That insufferable,dull-witted donkey! That?
<br> Hardin broke&nbsp; in: "Not at all. He's merely&nbsp; the product of his environment.
<br> He doesn't&nbsp; understand much&nbsp; except that 'I&nbsp; have a gun&nbsp; and you haven't.?
<br> Pirenne whirled on him&nbsp; in exasperation. "What in space did you mean by thetalk about military bases and tribute? Are you crazy?""No. I merely gave him rope and let him talk. You'll notice that he managedto stumble out with&nbsp; Anacreon's real intentions ?that is, the parceling upof&nbsp; Terminus into&nbsp; landed estates. Of&nbsp; course, I&nbsp; don't intend to&nbsp; let thathappen.""You don't intend. You don't. And who are you? And may I ask what you meantby blowing off your mouth about our nuclear-power plant? Why, it's just thething that would make us a military target.""Yes,"&nbsp; grinned Hardin.&nbsp; "A&nbsp; military target&nbsp; to stay&nbsp; away from.&nbsp; Isn't itobvious why I brought&nbsp; the subject up? It happened to confirm a very strongsuspicion I had had.""And that was what?""That&nbsp; Anacreon no&nbsp; longer has&nbsp; a nuclear-power&nbsp; economy. If they&nbsp; had, ourfriend would&nbsp; undoubtedly have&nbsp; realized that plutonium,&nbsp; except in ancienttradition is&nbsp; not used in power&nbsp; plants. And therefore it&nbsp; follows that therest of the Periphery&nbsp; no longer has nuclear power either. Certainly Smyrnohasn't, or&nbsp; Anacreon wouldn't have won most of&nbsp; the battles in their recentwar. Interesting, wouldn't you say?""Bah!"&nbsp; Pirenne&nbsp;&nbsp; left&nbsp; in&nbsp; fiendish&nbsp; humor,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; Hardin&nbsp; smiled&nbsp; gently.
<br> He threw his cigar away and looked up at the outstretched Galaxy. "Back tooil and coal, are they?" he murmured ?and what the rest of his thoughtswere he kept to himself.
