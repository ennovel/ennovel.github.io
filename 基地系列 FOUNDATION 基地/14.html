Thecry of adjournment rang&nbsp; out, and guards separated them. Gaal was led away.
<br> The&nbsp; next day's&nbsp; hearings&nbsp; were entirely&nbsp; different. Hari&nbsp; Seldon&nbsp; and GaalDornick&nbsp; were&nbsp; alone with&nbsp; the&nbsp; Commission.&nbsp; They were&nbsp; seated&nbsp; at a&nbsp; tabletogether, with&nbsp; scarcely a separation&nbsp; between the five judges&nbsp; and the twoaccused. They&nbsp; were even&nbsp; offered cigars from&nbsp; a box of&nbsp; iridescent plasticwhich had the appearance&nbsp; of water, endlessly flowing. The eyes were fooledinto seeing the motion although the fingers reported it to be hard and dry.
<br> Seldon accepted one; Gaal refused.
<br> Seldon said, "My lawyer is not present."A Commissioner replied, "This is no longer a trial, Dr. Seldon. We are hereto discuss the safety of the State."Linge Chen&nbsp; said, "I will speak,"&nbsp; and the other Commissioners&nbsp; sat back intheir chairs, prepared to listen. A silence formed about Chen into which hemight drop his words.
<br> Gaal held his breath. Chen, lean and hard, older in looks than in fact, wasthe actual&nbsp; Emperor of all the Galaxy. The child&nbsp; who bore the title itselfwas only&nbsp; a symbol&nbsp; manufactured by Chen,&nbsp; and not the&nbsp; first such, either.
<br> Chen said, "Dr. Seldon,&nbsp; you disturb the peace of the Emperor's realm. Noneof the&nbsp; quadrillions living now among&nbsp; all the stars of&nbsp; the Galaxy will beliving&nbsp; a century&nbsp; from now.&nbsp; Why, then,&nbsp; should we concern&nbsp; ourselves withevents of three centuries distance?""I shall not&nbsp; be alive half a decade hence," said Seldon,&nbsp; and yet it is ofoverpowering concern to me.&nbsp; Call it idealism. Call it an identification ofmyself with&nbsp; that mystical&nbsp; generalization to which&nbsp; we refer by&nbsp; the term,'humanity.'""I do not wish to take the trouble to understand mysticism. Can you tell mewhy I&nbsp; may not rid myself&nbsp; of you, and of&nbsp; an uncomfortable and unnecessarythree-century&nbsp; future&nbsp; which&nbsp; I&nbsp; will&nbsp; never&nbsp; see by&nbsp; having&nbsp; you&nbsp; executedtonight?""A week&nbsp; ago," said&nbsp; Seldon, lightly, "you&nbsp; might have done&nbsp; so and perhapsretained a&nbsp; one in&nbsp; ten probability of&nbsp; yourself remaining alive&nbsp; at year'send. Today,&nbsp; the one in ten&nbsp; probability is scarcely one&nbsp; in ten thousand."There were expired breaths in the gathering and uneasy stirrings. Gaal feltthe&nbsp; short hairs&nbsp; prickle on&nbsp; the back&nbsp; of his&nbsp; neck. Chen's&nbsp; upper eyelidsdropped a little.
<br> "How so?" he said.
<br> "The fall&nbsp; of Trantor," said Seldon, "cannot&nbsp; be stopped by any conceivableeffort.&nbsp; It can&nbsp; be hastened&nbsp; easily, however.&nbsp; The tale of&nbsp; my interruptedtrial will&nbsp; spread through the&nbsp; Galaxy. Frustration of my&nbsp; plans to lightenthe disaster will convince people that the future holds no promise to them.
<br> Already they&nbsp; recall the lives&nbsp; of their grandfathers with&nbsp; envy. They willsee&nbsp; that political&nbsp; revolutions and&nbsp; trade stagnations will&nbsp; increase. Thefeeling will pervade the&nbsp; Galaxy that only what a man can grasp for himselfat&nbsp; that moment will&nbsp; be of any&nbsp; account. Ambitious&nbsp; men will not&nbsp; wait andunscrupulous men will not hang back. By their every action they will hastenthe decay&nbsp; of the worlds. Have&nbsp; me killed and Trantor&nbsp; will fall not withinthree centuries&nbsp; but within fifty years and&nbsp; you, yourself, within a singleyear."Chen said, "These are words to frighten children, and yet your death is notthe only answer which will satisfy us."He lifted his slender hand from the papers on which it rested, so that onlytwo fingers touched lightly upon the topmost sheet.
<br> "Tell&nbsp; me," he&nbsp; said, "will your&nbsp; only activity&nbsp; be that of&nbsp; preparing thisencyclopedia you speak of?""It will.""And need that be done on Trantor?""Trantor, my lord, possessss the Imperial Library, as well as the scholarlyresources of the University of Trantor.""And yet&nbsp; if you were located&nbsp; elsewhere?, let us&nbsp; say upon a planet wherethe&nbsp; hurry&nbsp; and&nbsp; distractions&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; metropolis will&nbsp; not&nbsp; interfere&nbsp; withscholastic&nbsp; musings;&nbsp; where your&nbsp; men&nbsp; may devote&nbsp; themselves entirely&nbsp; andsingle-mindedly&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; their&nbsp; work;&nbsp;&nbsp; 杕ight&nbsp; not&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; have&nbsp; advantages?""Minor ones, perhaps.""Such a world had been chosen, then. You may work, doctor, at your leisure,with your&nbsp; hundred thousand&nbsp; about you. The&nbsp; Galaxy will know&nbsp; that you areworking and fighting the Fall. They will even be told that you will preventthe Fall." He smiled,&nbsp; "Since I do not believe in so many things, it is notdifficult for&nbsp; me to disbelieve in the Fall as well,&nbsp; so that I am entirelyconvinced I will be telling the truth to the people. And meanwhile, doctor,you&nbsp; will not&nbsp; trouble&nbsp; Trantor and&nbsp; there will&nbsp; be&nbsp; no disturbance&nbsp; of theEmperor's peace.
<br> "The alternative is death for yourself and for as many of your followers aswill seem necessary. Your&nbsp; earlier threats I disregard. The opportunity forchoosing between death and exile is given you over a time period stretchingfrom this moment to one five minutes hence.""Which is the world chosen, my lord?" said Seldon.
<br> "It is called, I&nbsp; believe, Terminus," said Chen. Negligently, he turned thepapers upon his desk&nbsp; with his fingertips so that they faced Seldon. "It isuninhabited, but quite habitable, and can be molded to suit the necessitiesof scholars. It is somewhat secluded?
<br> Seldon&nbsp;&nbsp; interrupted,&nbsp; "It&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; edge&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; Galaxy,&nbsp; sir.""As&nbsp; I&nbsp; have&nbsp; said,&nbsp;&nbsp; somewhat&nbsp; secluded.&nbsp; It&nbsp; will&nbsp; suit&nbsp; your&nbsp; needs&nbsp; forconcentration. Come, you have two minutes left."Seldon said,&nbsp; "We will need time&nbsp; to arrange such a&nbsp; trip. There are twentythousand families involved.""You will be given time."Seldon&nbsp; thought a moment,&nbsp; and the last&nbsp; minute began&nbsp; to die. He&nbsp; said, "Iaccept exile."Gaal's heart skipped a&nbsp; beat at the words. For the most part, he was filledwith a tremendous joy for who would not be, to escape death. Yet in all hisvast&nbsp; relief, he&nbsp; found&nbsp; space for&nbsp; a little&nbsp; regret&nbsp; that Seldon&nbsp; had beendefeated.
