He hadn't slept the night before and he had a good ideathat&nbsp;&nbsp; he&nbsp; wouldn't&nbsp; sleep&nbsp;&nbsp; this&nbsp; coming&nbsp;&nbsp; night.&nbsp; His&nbsp; eyes&nbsp;&nbsp; showed&nbsp; it.
<br> He said wearily, "And that covers it?""I&nbsp; think so."&nbsp; Yohan Lee&nbsp; put a&nbsp; hand to&nbsp; his chin.&nbsp; "How does&nbsp; it sound?""Not too bad. It's got to be done, you understand, with impudence. That is,there is to be no hesitation; no time to allow them to grasp the situation.
<br> Once we are in a position to give orders, why, give them as though you wereborn&nbsp; to do&nbsp; so, and&nbsp; they'll obey out&nbsp; of habit.&nbsp; That's the essence&nbsp; of acoup.""If the Board remains irresolute for even ?
<br> "The Board? Count them out. After tomorrow, their importance as a factor inTerminus affairs won't matter a rusty half-credit."Lee nodded slowly. "Yet&nbsp; it is strange that they've done nothing to stop usso far. You say they weren't entirely in the dark.""Fara stumbles at the&nbsp; edges of the problem. Sometimes he makes me nervous.
<br> And Pirenne's been suspicious of me since I was elected. But, you see, theynever had&nbsp; the capacity&nbsp; of really understanding&nbsp; what was up.&nbsp; Their wholetraining&nbsp; has been&nbsp; authoritarian.&nbsp; They are&nbsp; sure that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Emperor, justbecause&nbsp; he is&nbsp; the Emperor, is&nbsp; all-powerful. And&nbsp; they are sure&nbsp; that theBoard of Trustees, simply because it is the Board of Trustees acting in thename of&nbsp; the Emperor,&nbsp; cannot be in a&nbsp; position where it does&nbsp; not give theorders. That incapacity to&nbsp; recognize the possibility of revolt is our bestally."He heaved&nbsp; out of his chair and went to the&nbsp; water cooler. "They're not badfellows, Lee,&nbsp; when they stick to&nbsp; their Encyclopedia ?and&nbsp; we'll see thatthat's where they stick&nbsp; in the future. They're hopelessly incompetent whenit comes&nbsp; to ruling Terminus. Go away now and&nbsp; start things rolling. I wantto be alone."He&nbsp; sat down&nbsp; on the&nbsp; comer of&nbsp; his desk&nbsp; and stared&nbsp; at the cup&nbsp; of water.
<br> Space! If only he&nbsp; were as confident as he pretended! The Anacreonians werelanding in&nbsp; two days&nbsp; and what had&nbsp; he to go&nbsp; on but&nbsp; a set of&nbsp; notions andhalf-guesses as&nbsp; to what&nbsp; Had Seldon had&nbsp; been driving at&nbsp; these past fiftyyears?&nbsp; He wasn't&nbsp; even a&nbsp; real, honest-to-goodness&nbsp; psychologist ? just afumbler with a little&nbsp; training trying to outguess the greatest mind of theage.
<br> If&nbsp; Fara were&nbsp; fight;&nbsp; if Anacreon&nbsp; were all&nbsp; the&nbsp; problem Hari&nbsp; Seldon hadforeseen; if&nbsp; the Encyclopedia were&nbsp; all he was interested&nbsp; in preserving ?
<br> then what price coup d'閠at?
<br> He shrugged and drank his water.
