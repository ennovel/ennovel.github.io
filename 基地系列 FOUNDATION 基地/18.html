Located on the very fringe of theGalactic spiral,&nbsp; an only planet of an isolated&nbsp; sun, poor in resources andnegligible in&nbsp; economic value, it&nbsp; was never settled in&nbsp; the five centuriesafter&nbsp; its&nbsp;&nbsp; discovery,&nbsp; until&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; landing&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; Encyclopedists....
<br> It&nbsp; was inevitable&nbsp; that as&nbsp; a new&nbsp; generation grew, Terminus&nbsp; would becomesomething more&nbsp; than an appendage of&nbsp; the psychohistorians of Trantor. Withthe Anacreonian revolt and the rise to power of Salvor Hardin, first of thegreat line of...
<br> ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICALewis Pirenne&nbsp; was busily engaged at his desk in&nbsp; the one well-lit comer ofthe room. Work had&nbsp; to be co-ordinated. Effort had to be organized. Threadshad to be woven into a pattern.
<br> Fifty&nbsp; years&nbsp;&nbsp; now;&nbsp; fifty&nbsp; years&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; establish&nbsp; themselves&nbsp; and&nbsp; set&nbsp; upEncyclopedia&nbsp; Foundation Number&nbsp; One&nbsp; into a&nbsp; smoothly working&nbsp; unit. Fiftyyears&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; gather&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; raw&nbsp;&nbsp; material.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifty&nbsp;&nbsp; years&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; prepare.
<br> It had&nbsp; been done. Five more&nbsp; years would see the&nbsp; publication of the firstvolume of the most&nbsp; monumental work the Galaxy had ever conceived. And thenat ten-year&nbsp; intervals ?regularly ?like&nbsp; clockwork ?volume after volume.
<br> And with&nbsp; them there&nbsp; would be supplements;&nbsp; special articles on&nbsp; events ofcurrent interest, until?
<br> Pirenne&nbsp; stirred&nbsp; uneasily, as&nbsp; the&nbsp; muted&nbsp; buzzer upon&nbsp; his desk&nbsp; mutteredpeevishly.&nbsp; He had&nbsp; almost forgotten&nbsp; the appointment.&nbsp; He shoved&nbsp; the doorrelease and out of an abstracted comer of one eye saw the door open and thebroad&nbsp;&nbsp; figure&nbsp; of&nbsp; Salvor&nbsp;&nbsp; Hardin&nbsp; enter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pirenne&nbsp; did&nbsp; not&nbsp;&nbsp; look&nbsp; up.
<br> Hardin smiled&nbsp; to himself.&nbsp; He was in a&nbsp; hurry, but he knew&nbsp; better than totake&nbsp; offense at Pirenne's&nbsp; cavalier treatment&nbsp; of anything or&nbsp; anyone thatdisturbed him at his work. He buried himself in the chair on the other sideof the desk and waited.
<br> Pirenne's stylus made the faintest scraping sound as it raced across paper.
<br> Otherwise, neither motion nor&nbsp; sound. And then Hardin withdrew a two-creditcoin from&nbsp; his vest pocket.&nbsp; He flipped it and&nbsp; its stainless-steel surfacecaught&nbsp; flitters of&nbsp; light&nbsp; as it&nbsp; tumbled through&nbsp; the&nbsp; air. He&nbsp; caught itand-flipped it&nbsp; again, watching the flashing&nbsp; reflections lazily. Stainlesssteel made&nbsp; good medium of exchange&nbsp; on a planet where&nbsp; all metal had to beimported.
<br> Pirenne&nbsp; looked&nbsp;&nbsp; up&nbsp; and&nbsp; blinked.&nbsp; "Stop&nbsp;&nbsp; that!"&nbsp; he&nbsp; said&nbsp; querulously.
<br> "Eh?""That infernal coin tossing. Stop it.""Oh." Hardin pocketed the metal disk. "Tell me when you're ready, will you?
<br> I promised&nbsp; to be back at the City Council&nbsp; meeting before the new aqueductproject is put to a vote."Pirenne sighed&nbsp; and shoved&nbsp; himself away from&nbsp; the desk. "I'm&nbsp; ready. But Ihope you&nbsp; aren't going&nbsp; to bother me&nbsp; with city affairs. Take&nbsp; care of thatyourself,&nbsp;&nbsp; please.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;&nbsp; Encyclopedia&nbsp;&nbsp; takes&nbsp;&nbsp; up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all&nbsp;&nbsp; my&nbsp;&nbsp; time.""Have&nbsp;&nbsp; you&nbsp;&nbsp; heard&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; news?"&nbsp;&nbsp; questioned&nbsp;&nbsp; Hardin,&nbsp;&nbsp; phlegmatically.
<br> "What news?""The news that the&nbsp; Terminus City ultrawave set received two hours ago. TheRoyal Governor&nbsp; of the Prefect of Anacreon has&nbsp; assumed the title of king.""Well? What of it?""It means," responded Hardin, "that we're cut off from the inner regions ofthe&nbsp; Empire. We've&nbsp; been expecting&nbsp; it but&nbsp; that doesn't&nbsp; make it&nbsp; any morecomfortable.&nbsp; Anacreon stands&nbsp; square&nbsp; across what&nbsp; was our&nbsp; last remainingtrade route&nbsp; to Santanni&nbsp; and to Trantor&nbsp; and to Vega itself.&nbsp; Where is ourmetal to come from?&nbsp; We haven't managed to get a steel or aluminum shipmentthrough in six months and now we won't be able to get any at all, except bygrace of the King of Anacreon."Pirenne&nbsp;&nbsp; tch-tched&nbsp;&nbsp; impatiently.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get&nbsp;&nbsp; them&nbsp;&nbsp; through&nbsp;&nbsp; him,&nbsp;&nbsp; then.""But can&nbsp; we? Listen,&nbsp; Pirenne, according to the&nbsp; charter which establishedthis Foundation,&nbsp; the Board&nbsp; of Trustees of the&nbsp; Encyclopedia Committee hasbeen given&nbsp; full administrative powers. I, as&nbsp; Mayor of Terminus City, havejust&nbsp; enough&nbsp; power to&nbsp; blow&nbsp; my&nbsp; own nose&nbsp; and&nbsp; perhaps to&nbsp; sneeze if&nbsp; youcountersign an&nbsp; order giving me permission.&nbsp; It's up to you&nbsp; and your Boardthen. I'm asking you in the name of the City, whose prosperity depends uponuninterrupted&nbsp; commerce with&nbsp; the&nbsp; Galaxy, to&nbsp; call an&nbsp; emergency meeting?
<br> "Stop!&nbsp; A&nbsp; campaign speech&nbsp; is&nbsp; out of&nbsp; order.&nbsp; Now, Hardin,&nbsp; the Board&nbsp; ofTrustees&nbsp; has not&nbsp; barred the&nbsp; establishment of&nbsp; a municipal&nbsp; government onTerminus.&nbsp; We understand&nbsp; one to&nbsp; be necessary&nbsp; because of the&nbsp; increase inpopulation&nbsp; since&nbsp; the&nbsp; Foundation was&nbsp; established&nbsp; fifty&nbsp; years ago,&nbsp; andbecause&nbsp; of the&nbsp; increasing number&nbsp; of people involved&nbsp; in non-Encyclopediaaffairs.&nbsp; But&nbsp; that does&nbsp; not&nbsp; mean&nbsp; that the&nbsp; first&nbsp; and only&nbsp; aim of&nbsp; theFoundation is no longer to publish the definitive Encyclopedia of all humanknowledge.&nbsp; We are&nbsp; a State-supported,&nbsp; scientific institution,&nbsp; Hardin. Wecannot&nbsp;&nbsp; ?&nbsp; must&nbsp; not&nbsp;&nbsp; ?&nbsp; will&nbsp;&nbsp; not&nbsp; interfere&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; local&nbsp;&nbsp; politics.""Local politics!&nbsp; By the Emperor's left&nbsp; toe, Pirenne, this is&nbsp; a matter oflife and death. The planet, Terminus, by itself cannot support a mechanizedcivilization. It&nbsp; lacks metals. You know&nbsp; that. It hasn't a&nbsp; trace of iron,copper, or&nbsp; aluminum in the surface rocks,&nbsp; and precious little of anythingelse.&nbsp; What&nbsp; do&nbsp; you&nbsp;&nbsp; think&nbsp; will&nbsp; happen&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Encyclopedia&nbsp; if&nbsp; thiswatchmacallum King of Anacreon clamps down on us?""On&nbsp; us? Are you&nbsp; forgetting that we&nbsp; are under&nbsp; the direct control&nbsp; of theEmperor himself? We are not part of the Prefect of Anacreon or of any otherprefect. Memorize&nbsp; that! We are part of&nbsp; the Emperor's personal domain, andno one touches us. The Empire can protect its own.""Then why&nbsp; didn't it&nbsp; prevent the Royal&nbsp; Governor of Anacreon&nbsp; from kickingover the traces? And only Anacreon?
<br> At least twenty of the outermost prefects of the Galaxy, the entirePeriphery as a matter of fact, have begun steering things their own way. Itell you I feel damned uncertain of the Empire and its ability to protectus.""Hokum! Royal Governors, Kings ?what's the difference? The Empire isalways shot through with a certain amount of politics and with differentmen pulling this way and that. Governors have rebelled, and, for thatmatter, Emperors have been deposed, or assassinated before this. But whathas that to do with the Empire itself? Forget it, Hardin. It's none of ourbusiness. We are first of all and last of all-scientists. And our concernis the Encyclopedia.
<br> Oh, yes, I'd almost forgotten. Hardin!""Well?""Do something about that paper of yours!" Pirenne's voice was angry.
<br> "The Terminus City Journal? It isn't mine; it's privately owned. What's itbeen doing?""For weeks now it has been recommending that the fiftieth anniversary ofthe establishment of the Foundation be made the occasion for publicholidays and quite inappropriate celebrations.""And why not? The computoclock will open the Vault in three months. I wouldcall this first opening a big occasion, wouldn't you?""Not for silly pageantry, Hardin. The Vault and its opening concern theBoard of Trustees alone. Anything of importance will be communicated to thepeople. That is final and please make it plain to the Journal.""I'm sorry, Pirenne, but the City Charter guarantees a certain minor matterknown as freedom of the press.""It may. But the Board of Trustees does not. I am the Emperor'srepresentative on Terminus, Hardin, and have full powers in this respect."Hardin's expression became that of a man counting to ten, mentally. Hesaid, grimly: "in connection with your status as Emperor's representative,then, I have a final piece of news to give you.""About Anacreon?" Pirenne's lips tightened. He felt annoyed.
<br> "Yes. A special envoy will be sent to us from Anacreon. In two weeks.""An envoy? Here? From Anacreon?" Pirenne chewed that. "What for?"Hardin stood up, and shoved his chair back up against the desk. "I give youone guess." And he left ?quite unceremoniously.
