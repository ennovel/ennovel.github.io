Hardin had been the leading spirit in the drive to incorporateTerminus&nbsp; into an&nbsp; autonomous&nbsp; municipality-he had&nbsp; been elected&nbsp; its firstmayor-so it&nbsp; was not surprising that, though not a single&nbsp; share of Journalstock was&nbsp; in his&nbsp; name, some sixty&nbsp; percent was controlled by&nbsp; him in moredevious fashions.
<br> There were ways.
<br> Consequently, when Hardin began suggesting to Pirenne that he be allowed toattend meetings of the Board of Trustees, it was not quite coincidence thatthe&nbsp; Journal&nbsp; began a similar campaign.&nbsp; And the first mass&nbsp; meeting in thehistory of the Foundation was held, demanding representation of the City inthe "national" government.
<br> And, eventually, Pirenne capitulated with ill grace.
<br> Hardin, as he sat at the foot of the table, speculated idly as to just whatit was that made&nbsp; physical scientists such poor administrators. It might bemerely that&nbsp; they were&nbsp; too used to&nbsp; inflexible fact and far&nbsp; too unused topliable people.
<br> In any&nbsp; case, there was Tomaz Sutt and Jord Fara&nbsp; on his left; Lundin Crastand Yate&nbsp; Fulham on&nbsp; his fight; with&nbsp; Pirenne, himself, presiding.&nbsp; He knewthem all, of course, but they seemed to have put on an extra-special bit ofpomposity for the occasion.
<br> Hardin had&nbsp; dozed through the&nbsp; initial formalities and then&nbsp; perked up whenPirenne sipped&nbsp; at the glass of water before him&nbsp; by way of preparation andsaid:
<br> "I find&nbsp; it very gratifying to&nbsp; be able to inform&nbsp; the Board that since ourlast&nbsp; meeting, I&nbsp; have received&nbsp; word that&nbsp; Lord Dorwin, Chancellor&nbsp; of theEmpire, will&nbsp; arrive at Terminus in two weeks. It&nbsp; may be taken for grantedthat&nbsp; our relations&nbsp; with&nbsp; Anacreon will&nbsp; be smoothed&nbsp; out to&nbsp; our completesatisfaction&nbsp; as&nbsp; soon as&nbsp; the&nbsp; Emperor&nbsp; is informed&nbsp; of&nbsp; the situation.&nbsp; "He smiled and addressed Hardin across the length of the table. "Informationto this effect has been given the Journal."Hardin snickered below his&nbsp; breath. It seemed evident that Pirenne's desireto strut this information&nbsp; before him had been one reason for his admissioninto the sacrosanctum.
<br> He&nbsp; said evenly:&nbsp; "Leaving vague&nbsp; expressions out&nbsp; of account, what&nbsp; do youexpect Lord Dorwin to do?"Tomaz&nbsp; Sutt replied.&nbsp; He had&nbsp; a bad&nbsp; habit of&nbsp; addressing one in&nbsp; the thirdperson when in his more stately moods.
<br> "It is&nbsp; quite evident," he&nbsp; observed, "that Mayor Hardin&nbsp; is a professionalcynic.&nbsp; He can&nbsp; scarcely fail&nbsp; to realize&nbsp; that the&nbsp; Emperor would&nbsp; be mostunlikely to allow his personal rights to be infringed.""Why? What would he do in case they were?"There was an annoyed stir. Pirenne said, "You are out of order," and, as anafterthought,&nbsp; "and&nbsp; are&nbsp;&nbsp; making&nbsp; what&nbsp; are&nbsp; near-treasonable&nbsp; statements,besides.""Am I to consider myself answered?""Yes! If you have nothing further to say?
<br> "Don't jump to conclusions. I'd like to ask a question. Besides this strokeof diplomacy&nbsp; ?which may or may not prove to&nbsp; mean anything ?has anythingconcrete been done to meet the Anacreonic menace?"Yate&nbsp; Fulham drew&nbsp; one hand along&nbsp; his ferocious&nbsp; red mustache. "You&nbsp; see amenace there, do you?""Don't you?""Scarcely"?this with indulgence. "The Emperor?
<br> "Great space!"&nbsp; Hardin felt annoyed. "What&nbsp; is this? Every once&nbsp; in a whilesomeone&nbsp; mentions 'Emperor'&nbsp; or 'Empire' as&nbsp; if it&nbsp; were a magic&nbsp; word. TheEmperor is&nbsp; thousands of parsecs away, and I doubt&nbsp; whether he gives a damnabout us.&nbsp; And if he does,&nbsp; what can he do? What&nbsp; there was of the imperialnavy in these regions is in the hands of the four kingdoms now and Anacreonhas&nbsp; its&nbsp; share. Listen,&nbsp; we&nbsp; have&nbsp; to fight&nbsp; with&nbsp; guns,&nbsp; not with&nbsp; words.
<br> "Now, get&nbsp; this. We've had two&nbsp; months' grace so far,&nbsp; mainly because we'vegiven Anacreon&nbsp; the idea that we've got nuclear&nbsp; weapons. Well, we all knowthat&nbsp; that's a&nbsp; little white&nbsp; lie. We've&nbsp; got nuclear&nbsp; power, but&nbsp; only forcommercial uses,&nbsp; and darn little at&nbsp; that. They're going to&nbsp; find that outsoon, and&nbsp; if you think they're going to&nbsp; enjoy being jollied along, you'remistaken.""My dear sir?
<br> "Hold on:&nbsp; I'm not finished." Hardin&nbsp; was warming up. He&nbsp; liked this. "It'sall very well to&nbsp; drag chancellors into this, but it would be much nicer todrag a few great big siege guns fitted for beautiful nuclear bombs into it.
<br> We've lost two months, gentlemen, and we may not have another two months tolose. What do you propose to do?"Said Lundin&nbsp; Crast, his&nbsp; long nose wrinkling angrily:&nbsp; "If you're proposingthe militarization&nbsp; of the Foundation, I won't hear a&nbsp; word of it. It wouldmark our&nbsp; open entrance&nbsp; into the field&nbsp; of politics. We, Mr.&nbsp; Mayor, are ascientific foundation and nothing else."Added Sutt:&nbsp; "He does not realize,&nbsp; moreover, that building armaments wouldmean withdrawing men ?valuable men ?from the Encyclopedia. That cannot bedone, come what may.""Very&nbsp;&nbsp; true,"&nbsp; agreed&nbsp;&nbsp; Pirenne.&nbsp; "The&nbsp;&nbsp; Encyclopedia&nbsp; first&nbsp;&nbsp; ? always."Hardin&nbsp; groaned&nbsp; in&nbsp; spirit.&nbsp; The Board&nbsp; seemed&nbsp; to&nbsp; suffer violently&nbsp; fromEncyclopedia on the brain,He&nbsp; said icily:&nbsp; "Has&nbsp; it ever&nbsp; occurred to&nbsp; this Board&nbsp; that it&nbsp; is barelypossible&nbsp; that Terminus&nbsp; may have&nbsp; interests other than&nbsp; the Encyclopedia?"Pirenne replied:&nbsp; "I do not conceive, Hardin, that&nbsp; the Foundation can haveany interest other than the Encyclopedia.""I&nbsp; didn't&nbsp; say the&nbsp; Foundation;&nbsp; I said&nbsp;&nbsp; Terminus. I'm&nbsp; afraid you&nbsp; don'tunderstand the&nbsp; situation. There's a&nbsp; good million of us&nbsp; here on Terminus,and not more than&nbsp; a hundred and fifty thousand are working directly on theEncyclopedia. To&nbsp; the rest of&nbsp; us, this is&nbsp; home. We were&nbsp; born here. We'reliving here.&nbsp; Compared with our farms and our&nbsp; homes and our factories, theEncyclopedia&nbsp;&nbsp; means&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; little&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; us.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; want&nbsp;&nbsp; them&nbsp;&nbsp; protected?
<br> He was shouted down.
<br> "The Encyclopedia first," ground out Crast. "We have a mission to fulfill.""Mission,&nbsp; hell," shouted Hardin.&nbsp; "That might&nbsp; have been true&nbsp; fifty yearsago. But this is a new generation.""That has&nbsp; nothing to&nbsp; do with it,"&nbsp; replied Pirenne. "We&nbsp; are scientists."And&nbsp; Hardin leaped&nbsp; through the&nbsp; opening. "Are&nbsp; you, though? That's&nbsp; a nicehallucination, isn't&nbsp; it? Your&nbsp; bunch here is&nbsp; a perfect example&nbsp; of what'sbeen&nbsp; wrong with&nbsp; the entire Galaxy&nbsp; for thousands&nbsp; of years. What&nbsp; kind ofscience is&nbsp; it to be stuck&nbsp; out here for centuries&nbsp; classifying the work ofscientists of the last millennium? Have you ever thought of working onward,extending their knowledge and&nbsp; improving upon it? No! You're quite happy tostagnate.&nbsp; The whole&nbsp; Galaxy is,&nbsp; and has&nbsp; been for&nbsp; space knows&nbsp; how long.
<br> That's&nbsp; why&nbsp; the&nbsp; Periphery is&nbsp; revolting;&nbsp; that's&nbsp; why communications&nbsp; arebreaking down; that's why petty wars are becoming eternal; that's why wholesystems are losing nuclear&nbsp; power and going back to barbarous techniques ofchemical power.
<br> "If&nbsp;&nbsp; you&nbsp; ask&nbsp;&nbsp; me,"&nbsp;&nbsp; he&nbsp; cried,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "the&nbsp;&nbsp; Galactic&nbsp; Empire&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; dying!"He&nbsp; paused&nbsp; and dropped&nbsp; into&nbsp; his chair&nbsp; to&nbsp; catch his&nbsp; breath, paying&nbsp; noattention to the two or three that were attempting simultaneously to answerhim.
<br> Crast&nbsp; got the&nbsp; floor. "I&nbsp; don't know&nbsp; what you're&nbsp; trying to gain&nbsp; by yourhysterical&nbsp; statements,&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp; Mayor.&nbsp; Certainly,&nbsp; you&nbsp; are&nbsp; adding&nbsp; nothingconstructive to&nbsp; the discussion.&nbsp; I move, Mr. Chairman,&nbsp; that the speaker'sremarks be placed out of order and the discussion be resumed from the pointwhere it was interrupted."Jord Fara&nbsp; bestirred himself for the first time. Up&nbsp; to this point Fara hadtaken no&nbsp; part in the argument&nbsp; even at its hottest.&nbsp; But now his ponderousvoice, every&nbsp; bit as&nbsp; ponderous as his three-hundred-pound&nbsp; body, burst itsbass way out.
<br> "Haven't we forgotten something, gentlemen?""What?" asked Pirenne, peevishly.
<br> "That in&nbsp; a month we celebrate our fiftieth&nbsp; anniversary." Fara had a trickof&nbsp;&nbsp; uttering&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; most&nbsp;&nbsp; obvious&nbsp; platitudes&nbsp;&nbsp; with&nbsp; great&nbsp;&nbsp; profundity.
<br> "What of it?""And on that anniversary," continued Fara, placidly, "Hari Seldon's Vaultwill open. Have you ever considered what might be in the Vault?""I don't know. Routine matters. A stock Speech of congratulations, perhaps.
<br> I don't think any significance need be placed on the Vault ?though theJournal"?and he glared at Hardin, who grinned back ?did try to make anissue of it. I put a stop to that.""Ah," said Fara, "but perhaps you are wrong. Doesn't it strike you" ?hepaused and put a finger to his round little nose ?that the Vault isopening at a very convenient time?""Very inconvenient time, you mean," muttered Fulham. "We've got some otherthings to worry about.""Other things more important than a message from Hari Seldon? I think not."Fara was growing more pontifical than ever, and Hardin eyed himthoughtfully. What was he getting at?
<br> "In fact," said Fara, happily, "you all seem to forget that Seldon was thegreatest psychologist of our time and that he was the founder of ourFoundation. It seems reasonable to assume that he used his science todetermine the probable course of the history of the immediate future. If hedid, as seems likely, I repeat, he would certainly have managed to find away to warn us of danger and, perhaps, to point out a solution. TheEncyclopedia was very dear to his heart, you know."An aura of puzzled doubt prevailed. Pirenne hemmed. "Well, now, I don'tknow. Psychology is a great science, but-there are no psychologists amongus at the moment, I believe. It seems to me we're on uncertain ground."Fara turned to Hardin. "Didn't you study psychology under Alurin?"Hardin answered, half in reverie: "Yes, I never completed my studies,though. I got tired of theory. I wanted to be a psychological engineer, butwe lacked the facilities, so I did the next best thing ?I went intopolitics. It's practically the same thing.""Well, what do you think of the Vault?"And Hardin replied cautiously, "I don't know."He did not say a word for the remainder of the meeting even though it gotback to the subject of the Chancellor of the Empire.
<br> In fact, he didn't even listen. He'd been put on a new track and thingswere falling into place-just a little. Little angles were fitting together?one or two.
<br> And psychology was the key. He was sure of that.
<br> He was trying desperately to remember the psychological theory he had oncelearned ?and from it he got one thing right at the start.
<br> A great psychologist such as Seldon could unravel human emotions and humanreactions sufficiently to be able to predict broadly the historical sweepof the future.
<br> And what would that mean?
