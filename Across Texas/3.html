IN SAN ANTONIO.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      NICK and Herbert stopped on the Plaza to inspect a bear, which a lank Texan had fastened to a staple by a rope, and was waiting thus late at night for a purchaser. The moment the boys passed, the owner began urging them to buy, offering the brute for fifteen dollars, and dwelling with much eloquence on the great bargain it was for anyone.
<br> 
<br> Our friends, however, had no use for any animals of that species, and, taking care to keep beyond reach of the beast, who showed a desire for closer acquaintance, they sauntered toward the hotel.
<br> 
<br> Just before reaching it, someone touched Nick’s arm in such a timid manner that he turned, wondering what it could mean.
<br> 
<br> A lad about twelve years of age, ragged and the picture of distress, asked in a tremulous voice:
<br> 
<br> [21]
<br> 
<br> “Please, sir, you’re from the North, aint you?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes,” replied Nick; “is your home there?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, sir,” said the lad, swallowing a lump in his throat, “and I would give the world, if I had it, if I was back there again.”
<br> 
<br> “How is it you’re here?”
<br> 
<br> “Me and Dick Harrison run away from home; we lived in Philadelphia, and we haven’t had anything to eat since yesterday.”
<br> 
<br> “Where is Dick?”
<br> 
<br> “He’s off yonder, on the other side of the Plaza; he’s just dead broke up, and says he won’t try nothin’ more, but is goin’ to lay down and die.”
<br> 
<br> “I don’t believe anyone has ever died of starvation in San Antonio; can’t you get work?”
<br> 
<br> “We have been trying for two weeks; we got a job or two that fetched us a little to eat, but we can’t do nothin’ more.”
<br> 
<br> “Take us over to where Dick is,” said Herbert, whose heart was touched, “and let us see him.”
<br> 
<br> [22]
<br> 
<br> “Come on,” said the boy, so cheerfully that Nick and his friend were satisfied he was telling the truth. On the way across the Plaza, they questioned Fred Beekman, as he gave his name, still further.
<br> 
<br> “What made you run away from home, Fred?”
<br> 
<br> “Me and Dick started out to kill Injins and grizzly bears.”
<br> 
<br> “How did you make out,” asked Herbert, who recalled that it was not so long since he had indulged in similar ambitious ideas.
<br> 
<br> “We haven’t killed any yet,” replied Fred, in such a doleful voice that the others could not help smiling.
<br> 
<br> “How did you get the money to come to Texas?”
<br> 
<br> “Dick and me stole it from our folks; we bought rifles and pistols, but when we got to Texarkana we was took up and the guns took away from us; we managed to sneak off, and had enough money left to come to Santone; here it give out, and we’ve had it hard since.”
<br> 
<br> “Had you pleasant homes?” asked Nick.
<br> 
<br> This question set Fred to crying. His[23] fingers were in his eyes, and he stumbled along for several paces before he could answer:
<br> 
<br> “Nobody ever had better homes, but we got it into our heads that it would be nice to shoot grizzly bears and Injins, and here we are. If we only had enough money to keep us from starvin’ we could walk home like reg’lar tramps.”
<br> 
<br> “You are a good many miles from Philadelphia,” said Nick. “If you could get there, would you go straight home, or would you start off on some other wild-goose chase like this?”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, if I could see father and mother and my brother and two sisters, I would work and go to school and do anything; I never knowed how good a home I had till I run away, and Dick feels the same way.”
<br> 
<br> A few minutes later they reached the spot where Dick had been left, but he was nowhere in sight. Fred looked around in wonder, and then became frightened.
<br> 
<br> “I’ll bet he’s gone and drownded hisself,” he said, in an awed whisper, “for he felt ’nough like it.”
<br> 
<br> [24]
<br> 
<br> “Boys like him don’t drown themselves,” replied Nick, who began to distrust the truthfulness of the lad; “if you want us to give you any help you must find Dick and bring him——”
<br> 
<br> “There he is!” broke in Fred, pointing to a figure lurking among the shadows some distance off, as if afraid to venture closer. “Here, Dick, come here! you needn’t be scart, they won’t hurt you!”
<br> 
<br> Seeing the lad approaching, Nick said: “Now, Fred, I don’t want you to speak a word till I get through with Dick.”
<br> 
<br> With considerable hesitation Dick ventured nearer, and Nick immediately took him in hand. After much questioning, he became convinced that the story told by the two was true. They were equally ragged and wretched looking, and, despite their coarse language, gave evidence of having belonged to good families.
<br> 
<br> Nick and Herbert provided them with an excellent supper. They were as ravenous as wild animals, and left no doubt that they were half famishing. Then, having made sure that[25] they had a place to sleep during the night, Nick told them to call at the hotel in the morning, and he would see whether he and his friend could do anything for them.
<br> 
<br> During the interview, Nick managed to get the addresses of their parents in Philadelphia, without either suspecting his purpose. On reaching the Menger, he at once telegraphed to each father, asking whether a son whose name he gave was missing. He hardly doubted their story, but it was well that he took means to make sure, before acting upon that belief.
<br> 
<br> In the course of the evening, a reply came to each message, saying that the boys had been missing for six weeks, begging Nick to send both home without delay, and pledging that the expense would be paid by the senders of the telegrams, or, if desired, funds would be telegraphed. Nick notified the parents that the boys would start northward in the morning, and a statement of the money expended would be forwarded by mail.
<br> 
<br> When Fred and Dick presented themselves to Nick and Herbert, and were told that word had been received from their relatives, who[26] would be delighted to receive them, they could hardly believe it, but were finally satisfied that there was no deception about it.
<br> 
<br> Herbert and Nick took the boys to a clothing establishment, where they were provided with comfortable outfits, a through ticket was furnished to each, enough money given to pay their expenses, and then, with a few words of counsel, they were despatched homeward, the happiest boys in the big State of Texas.
<br> 
<br> Then Nick inclosed the memoranda to the proper parties, and dismissed the subject from his mind, for weightier matters required attention.
<br> 
<br> Upon calling at the banker’s office in the afternoon, they were surprised to find he had not only selected the two men that were to bear them company, but they were present, by appointment with Mr. Lord, who knew at what time the youths would arrive.
<br> 
<br> The individuals were typical cowboys, with their broad-brimmed sombreros and rattlesnake bands, their heavy shirts, trousers tucked in the tops of their boots, immense spurs, long wavy hair, handkerchiefs knotted[27] about their necks, bright eyes and not unhandsome countenances.
<br> 
<br> Arden Strubell, the elder, was about thirty-five years of age and wore a long moustache and goatee, which, like his hair and eyes, were of a dark auburn. Baker Lattin, his companion, was a few years younger, with lighter hair, a faint moustache, no goatee, was wide across the temples, and his eyes were light blue or gray, but his appearance was as alert and intelligent as the other’s.
<br> 
<br> These men were old friends of banker Lord, who had engaged with them upon several hunting excursions. It had fallen within his power to do for them a number of monetary favors, and they were the men who were ready to show their gratitude in any way he desired.
<br> 
<br> Strubell and Lattin intended to start in the course of a day or two for a ranch in New Mexico. They expected to travel the entire distance on horseback, accompanied by a single pack animal. Both once belonged to the mounted rangers of Texas, and had probably ridden over as much of that vast area as any other man within its limits, from No[28] Man’s Land on the north, through the Pan Handle and across the Llano Estacado to the Rio Grande and the Pecos on the south and west.
<br> 
<br> Strubell had been in several brushes with the terrible Geronimo and his dusky desperadoes, but he did not expect to reach the section where there was danger of collision with them, their stamping ground being further to the west.
<br> 
<br> Banker Lord had been offered a ranch over the line in New Mexico, at such reasonable figures that he was much inclined to buy it, but, with his usual caution, he desired to know of a certainty its value before investing the money. Strubell and Lattin had been employed, therefore, to make a thorough examination and to report on the same to him.
<br> 
<br> This happened most opportunely for Nick and Herbert, who thus were furnished with the very best company on their long and dangerous ride through Western Texas, while the ranchmen were ordered to go with them, if necessary, beyond into Arizona and Southern California.
