The coffee was prepared before the breaking up took place, for the cooking utensils were to go with the boys, and the men did not expect to have much leisure for preparing the delicious refreshment.
<br> 
<br> The trail, to which several references have been made, showed no evidence of having been recently travelled, though, in the course of time, a great many animals must have found their way through the hills by that route, which Nick took, with the pack horses stringing after, and Herbert bringing up the rear.
<br> 
<br> It was too strait to admit of two horsemen riding abreast, and there were places where[106] there was none too much room for a single animal. The path wound in and out among and around bowlders and large rocks, with stunted vegetation here and there, all the time steadily ascending, until a height of several hundred feet was attained, beyond which the descent was gradual, until the same level was reached on the other side.
<br> 
<br> The distance across the ridge or small mountain spur has been named—about one-fourth of a mile. It is probable that it was first made by the feet of wild animals when they were more numerous in the neighborhood, and was afterward used by Indians and hunters in passing to and fro through that portion of Texas. It was not the first time that the speechless part of creation has blazed the path for the pioneer to follow after them.
<br> 
<br> Nick Ribsam, having placed himself at the head of the little party, started his pony, Jack, on a moderate walk, the others following at the same pace, with Herbert and his Jill at the rear. They had named their animals that day, and both were surprised at the intelligence, speed, and endurance they developed.[107] It was impossible for the boys not to form a fondness for the ponies, since they were so worthy, and showed a strong affection for their masters.
<br> 
<br> The sun was well above the horizon, and the youths had plenty of time at command. At the highest portion of the path, where the space was broad enough for a dozen animals to stand side by side, the boys came together.
<br> 
<br> “I guess,” said Nick, from his saddle to Herbert on his right, “that you understand what all this means.”
<br> 
<br> “I suspect,” replied the elder, “that Strubell and Lattin are preparing for a fight with Rickard and his men.”
<br> 
<br> “I’ve no doubt that’s it, and they want us out of the way; they are pretty shrewd fellows, but I can’t help wondering what answer Strubell would have made, if I had asked him how our absence would be likely to help him and Lattin better than our presence. Well, no doubt they have good reason to want us beyond gunshot; we couldn’t give them any help, and might prove a hindrance, and they[108] think too much of us to allow us to run into danger when they can prevent it.”
<br> 
<br> “Nick,” said Herbert, as if giving expression to a thought that had been in his mind for some time; “I wish I could think as you do about things, but I can’t.”
<br> 
<br> The younger lad looked at him with surprise.
<br> 
<br> “What’s the odds, if we don’t see everything in exactly the same light? But I am not sure that I understand you.”
<br> 
<br> “Let’s dismount for a few minutes.”
<br> 
<br> The open space where the four animals were standing was so walled in by masses and piles of stone and vegetation that, although considerably higher than their friends at the foot of the ridge, the latter were invisible. By climbing a large, irregular bowlder, the Texans were in plain sight.
<br> 
<br> “Don’t let them see us,” said Herbert, “but let’s watch them for a while: maybe you can explain things, and maybe you can’t.”
<br> 
<br> Nick was a little disturbed by the words of Herbert, though it should be stated that it was not the mind of either to suspect the Texans[109] of anything but the truest friendship toward them; but it looked very much as if something was on foot which they wished to keep secret from their younger companions.
<br> 
<br> Strubell and Lattin were standing beside each other, with their whole attention directed eastward, where Rickard and his companions were known to be. At the moment the boys observed them, the elder Texan was holding the field glass levelled, while Lattin was doing what he could in the way of observation by shading his eyes with one hand. They were too far off to learn whether any words passed between the cowboys.
<br> 
<br> “I don’t notice anything to cause question,” remarked Nick, after viewing the couple for several minutes. “They are simply studying the horse thieves over yonder, in the hope of finding out something about their purposes. We have been doing the same thing, off and on, for a number of hours.”
<br> 
<br> “And you think there will be a fight?”
<br> 
<br> “It looks that way; it seems to me that Strubell and Lattin are satisfied that those fellows yonder are bent on stealing our horses,[110] and that they are likely to hang to us for days and nights, in the hope of getting a good chance to do so. So our friends have made up their minds that the best thing is to settle it at once, and by sending us off they have cleared the deck for action.”
<br> 
<br> “You put it very well,” said Herbert, whose admiration of his companion’s brightness never grew less; “and maybe, since you have explained some things so well, you will tell us about others.”
<br> 
<br> The youths now took turns in studying the group across the plain. The sun was out of sight behind the hills to their rear, but the eastern horizon, being relieved from the glare, was more favorable than before for observation through the instrument.
<br> 
<br> The three horses of the rogues were seen to be on their feet, with their riders standing beside them, as if about to climb into the saddles. One of the company, evidently Rickard himself, was several paces in advance of the others, as motionless as a statue, and evidently staring in turn toward the Texans at the foot of the ridge.
<br> 
<br> [111]
<br> 
<br> “It looks to me,” said Nick, passing the glass back to Herbert, “as though he is using a field glass: can it be possible?”
<br> 
<br> “What is there so wonderful about that? The cowboys may not be fond of spy glasses, but it would be strange if some of them did not employ all the help they could get in their business.”
<br> 
<br> Ceasing the conversation for the moment, the boys gave their whole attention to seeing what they could see.
<br> 
<br> Lattin, having passed the glass to Strubell, stepped back to where the fire was beginning to burn low, and threw on a few sticks. When the ascending smoke increased in volume, he took off his broad-brimmed hat and waved it in an odd way over the blaze. The result was that the volume of smoke, instead of ascending vertically, was broken into what might be called a regular irregularity, the appearance being peculiar and different from anything the the youths had ever observed before.
<br> 
<br> “That’s a signal to the horse thieves,” said Herbert, “and I would give a good deal to know what it means.”
<br> 
<br> [112]
<br> 
<br> “So would I,” added Nick, more disturbed by the sight than he was willing to admit.
<br> 
<br> It looked as if Herbert was right, but, if so, the singular feature of the business was that all the signalling seemed to be done by Strubell and Lattin. Nothing, so far as could be perceived, was sent in response by Rickard.
<br> 
<br> If there were actual communication going on between the parties, it was beyond the power of Nick and Herbert to frame a satisfactory explanation. Why intercourse should be held at such long range, when seemingly there was no reason for the mutual playing off, was a problem beyond ordinary acuteness.
<br> 
<br> But while the two were speculating, Herbert, with his field glass to his eye, began sweeping every part of the visible horizon. He had no special object in doing this, but thought he might perceive other horsemen, who had nothing to do with their friends or enemies.
<br> 
<br> Suddenly he startled Nick by an exclamation.
<br> 
<br> “Follow the direction of my finger!” he said, “and tell me what you see.”
<br> 
<br> [113]
<br> 
<br> He pointed almost north, that is in a line parallel with the ridge which they were crossing; and, without the aid of the field glass, Nick observed a second column of smoke of precisely the same appearance as that produced by Baker Lattin at the foot of the hills.
<br> 
<br> Apparently it was a mile distant, its location being at one corner of a right-angled triangle, with the horse thieves and Texans at the other two respective corners. The course of the ridge shut Strubell and Lattin from the sight of those that were managing the second fire. The parties could not have caught the first mutual glimpse, and yet nothing was more reasonable to believe than that they were telegraphing important messages back and forth to each other.
