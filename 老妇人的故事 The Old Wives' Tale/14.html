But she did not know his name, which was Gerald Scales. He was a rather short but extremely well-proportioned man of thirty, with fair hair, and a distinguished appearance, as became a representative of Birkinshaws. His broad, tight necktie, with an edge of white collar showing above it, was particularly elegant. He had been on the road for Birkinshaws for several years; but Sophia had only seen him once before in her life, when she was a little girl, three years ago. The relations between the travellers of the great firms and their solid, sure clients in small towns were in those days often cordially intimate. The traveller came with the lustre of a historic reputation around him; there was no need to fawn for orders; and the client's immense and immaculate respectability made him the equal of no matter what ambassador. It was a case of mutual esteem, and of that confidence-generating phenomenon, "an old account." The tone in which a commercial traveller of middle age would utter the phrase "an old account" revealed in a flash all that was romantic, prim, and stately in mid-Victorian commerce. In the days of Baines, after one of the elaborately engraved advice-circulars had arrived ('Our Mr.------will have the pleasure of waiting upon you on--day next, the--inst.') John might in certain cases be expected to say, on the morning of--day, 'Missis, what have ye gotten for supper to-night?'</p> 
<p>Mr. Gerald Scales had never been asked to supper; he had never even seen John Baines; but, as the youthful successor of an aged traveller who had had the pleasure of St. Luke's Square, on behalf of Birkinshaws, since before railways, Mrs. Baines had treated him with a faint agreeable touch of maternal familiarity; and, both her daughters being once in the shop during his visit, she had on that occasion commanded the gawky girls to shake hands with him.</p> 
<p>Sophia had never forgotten that glimpse. The young man without a name had lived in her mind, brightly glowing, as the very symbol and incarnation of the masculine and the elegant.</p> 
<p>The renewed sight of him seemed to have wakened her out of a sleep. Assuredly she was not the same Sophia. As she sat in her sister's chair in the corner, entrenched behind the perpendicular boxes, playing nervously with the scissors, her beautiful face was transfigured into the ravishingly angelic. It would have been impossible for Mr. Gerald Scales, or anybody else, to credit, as he gazed at those lovely, sensitive, vivacious, responsive features, that Sophia was not a character of heavenly sweetness and perfection. She did not know what she was doing; she was nothing but the exquisite expression of a deep instinct to attract and charm. Her soul itself emanated from her in an atmosphere of allurement and acquiescence. Could those laughing lips hang in a heavy pout? Could that delicate and mild voice be harsh? Could those burning eyes be coldly inimical? Never! The idea was inconceivable! And Mr. Gerald Scales, with his head over the top of the boxes, yielded to the spell. Remarkable that Mr. Gerald Scales, with all his experience, should have had to come to Bursley to find the pearl, the paragon, the ideal! But so it was. They met in an equal abandonment; the only difference between them was that Mr. Scales, by force of habit, kept his head.</p> 
<p>"I see it's your wakes here," said he.</p> 
<p>He was polite to the wakes; but now, with the least inflection in the world, he put the wakes at its proper level in the scheme of things as a local unimportance! She adored him for this; she was athirst for sympathy in the task of scorning everything local.</p> 
<p>"I expect you didn't know," she said, implying that there was every reason why a man of his mundane interests should not know.</p> 
<p>"I should have remembered if I had thought," said he. "But I didn't think. What's this about an elephant?"</p> 
<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed. "Have you heard of that?"</p> 
<p>"My porter was full of it."</p> 
<p>"Well," she said, "of course it's a very big thing in Bursley."</p> 
<p>As she smiled in gentle pity of poor Bursley, he naturally did the same. And he thought how much more advanced and broad the younger generation was than the old! He would never have dared to express his real feelings about Bursley to Mrs. Baines, or even to Mr. Povey (who was, however, of no generation); yet here was a young woman actually sharing them.</p> 
<p>She told him all the history of the elephant.</p> 
<p>"Must have been very exciting," he commented, despite himself.</p> 
<p>"Do you know," she replied, "it WAS."</p> 
<p>After all, Bursley was climbing in their opinion.</p> 
<p>"And mother and my sister and Mr. Povey have all gone to see it. That's why they're not here."</p> 
<p>That the elephant should have caused both Mr. Povey and Mrs. Baines to forget that the representative of Birkinshaws was due to call was indeed a final victory for the elephant.</p> 
<p>"But not you!" he exclaimed.</p> 
<p>"No," she said. "Not me."</p> 
<p>"Why didn't you go too?" He continued his flattering investigations with a generous smile.</p> 
<p>"I simply didn't care to," said she, proudly nonchalant.</p> 
<p>"And I suppose you are in charge here?"</p> 
<p>"No," she answered. "I just happened to have run down here for these scissors. That's all."</p> 
<p>"I often see your sister," said he. "'Often' do I say?--that is, generally, when I come; but never you."</p> 
<p>"I'm never in the shop," she said. "It's just an accident to-day."</p> 
<p>"Oh! So you leave the shop to your sister?"</p> 
<p>"Yes." She said nothing of her teaching.</p> 
<p>Then there was a silence. Sophia was very thankful to be hidden from the curiosity of the shop. The shop could see nothing of her, and only the back of the young man; and the conversation had been conducted in low voices. She tapped her foot, stared at the worn, polished surface of the counter, with the brass yard-measure nailed along its edge, and then she uneasily turned her gaze to the left and seemed to be examining the backs of the black bonnets which were perched on high stands in the great window. Then her eyes caught his for an important moment.</p> 
<p>"Yes," she breathed. Somebody had to say something. If the shop missed the murmur of their voices the shop would wonder what had happened to them.</p> 
<p>Mr. Scales looked at his watch. '"I dare say if I come in again about two--" he began.</p> 
<p>"Oh yes, they're SURE to be in then," she burst out before he could finish his sentence.</p> 
<p>He left abruptly, queerly, without shaking hands (but then it would have been difficult--she argued--for him to have put his arm over the boxes), and without expressing the hope of seeing her again. She peeped through the black bonnets, and saw the porter put the leather strap over his shoulders, raise the rear of the barrow, and trundle off; but she did not see Mr. Scales. She was drunk; thoughts were tumbling about in her brain like cargo loose in a rolling ship. Her entire conception of herself was being altered; her attitude towards life was being altered. The thought which knocked hardest against its fellows was, "Only in these moments have I begun to live!"</p> 
<p>And as she flitted upstairs to resume watch over her father she sought to devise an innocent-looking method by which she might see Mr. Scales when he next called. And she speculated as to what his name was.</p>
