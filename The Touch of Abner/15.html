<br> 
<br> Lawyer Rackshaw was in such an excellent frame of mind that he invited Henry Whittles to spend an evening with him at his office. This was something unusual, and as the two men sat down to a friendly game of poker, Whittles wondered what scheme the lawyer had in his mind. That there was some object he was quite sure, as Rackshaw never did anything out of the ordinary unless for some definite purpose.
<br> 
<br> It was a cozy room, comfortably furnished, clean and neat. A large greyhound lay at his master's feet, with his nose between his paws.
<br> 
<br> "Do you always bring that dog with you?" Whittles asked, as he shuffled the cards.
<br> 
<br> "Only at night," the lawyer replied as he looked down fondly upon the fine brute. "I like to have him along then—for company."
<br> 
<br> "For fear of what your enemies might do, eh?" and Whittles smiled somewhat knowingly.
<br> 
<br> "Well, perhaps you're right. Pedro never has his supper before he comes here, as I am always expecting him to get a good meal before he gets home."
<br> 
<br> "One of your special enemies, I suppose."
<br> 
<br> "Sure."
<br> 
<br> "Has he eaten any yet?"
<br> 
<br> "Not a d—n one, though I expect he'll have a meal before long."
<br> 
<br> "To-night?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, no," and the lawyer chuckled as he threw down a card. "The meal's in cold storage to-night as far as I know. But, then, one can never tell."
<br> 
<br> "Cold storage!" and Whittles' eyes opened wide as he paused in his play.
<br> 
<br> "Yes, in cold storage. Or, to be more exact, in jail. That's where the special meal is to-night."
<br> 
<br> "In jail! Why, man, what do you mean? Who's in jail?"
<br> 
<br> "Ho, ho! That's one on you, Hen, isn't it? Didn't know why I invited you here to-night, did you?"
<br> 
<br> "No; couldn't guess. Thought it must be something special, though."
<br> 
<br> "So it is, and I expected to have something special to drink, too. Confound that express company! It's as slow as cold molasses. I ordered something good for to-night, and it was to have been here before this."
<br> 
<br> "Going to drink the health of your special friends, are you?" Whittles queried, looking quizzically at the lawyer.
<br> 
<br> "To one friend only to-night, Hen. He's our mutual friend—a friend that sticketh closer than a brother, as the Good Book says, and whose tongue is as sharp as a razor, and stings like a hornet. That's the friend whose health we are going to drink to-night."
<br> 
<br> "I know of only one person who answers to your description," Whittles replied, "and that's Abner Andrews, of Ash Point. But he's no friend of ours."
<br> 
<br> "You're mistaken, Hen. He's my special friend, and yours, too, for that matter."
<br> 
<br> "Mine! H'm I guess you're astray there."
<br> 
<br> "Not at all. Didn't he offer a thousand dollars for that Orphanage?"
<br> 
<br> "A thousand be hanged! He offered it, but that's as far as it goes. He'll never pay a cent."
<br> 
<br> "Won't he? Well, we'll see about that. Anyway, he's got two kids at his home now. I sent them there last night so that he could start the Orphanage at once at Ash Point."
<br> 
<br> "You did!"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, and sent a note along, asking him how he liked town rats. My, they were a tough pair of youngsters, about as dirty as you'll find anywhere. 'Sloppy' Sue's kids, you know."
<br> 
<br> "Ho, ho, that's a good one," Whittles roared. "Have you heard from Abner since?"
<br> 
<br> "Sure. He did me a great favor this morning, and that's why I'm so friendly to him now."
<br> 
<br> "What did he do?"
<br> 
<br> "Walked into the office of The Live Wire, and smashed up Joe Preston so badly that he's in the hospital now getting patched up."
<br> 
<br> Whittles' eyes fairly started out of his head at this astounding piece of news, and he dropped his cards upon the table.
<br> 
<br> "What was it all about?" he at length found voice to ask.
<br> 
<br> "Oh, merely over that article in the paper about Mrs. Andrews running away with Ikey Dimock's chauffeur. I got the news from the police station late last night, and phoned it to the Wire. I knew that Joe would make the most of it, and get something in return. I'm mighty glad he did, for he's been very bumptious of late, and has rapped me pretty hard. Abner's saved me a nasty job."
<br> 
<br> "He did? Well, I declare!"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, and Abner's in jail, repenting, no doubt."
<br> 
<br> "Repenting? Not a bit of it. He's raging like a caged lion, if I'm not mistaken. My, how I'd like to have seen him at Joe. I've had no love for that fellow since he wrote that nasty skit about me last year. Did he put up much of a fight?"
<br> 
<br> "Who? Abner?"
<br> 
<br> "No; Joe."
<br> 
<br> "He tried to, so I heard, but he hadn't the ghost of a chance against that farmer giant. He came into the office, stuck a copy of the Wire before Joe's nose, and asked him if he had written that article about his wife. Joe got mad, blazed up, and consigned Abner to the hot place."
<br> 
<br> "Good Lord!" Whittles gasped. "Joe must have been crazy."
<br> 
<br> "If he wasn't crazy then, he was a few minutes later. Tom, the office boy, said it was terrible. Abner gave a roar like thunder and sailed into Joe. When the police arrived there wasn't much of Joe left, according to Tom. He was unconscious, and the office was badly damaged."
<br> 
<br> "Did the police have any trouble with Abner?" Whittles asked almost breathlessly.
<br> 
<br> "No, I guess not. He went like a lamb, though Tom said he had a wild look in his eyes."
<br> 
<br> Whittles suddenly gasped; his face turned deathly pale, and his hands trembled.
<br> 
<br> "What's wrong, Hen?" the lawyer asked, noting his companion's agitation. "I didn't know you were subject to nervous trouble. This story has upset you a bit. You need a stimulant. Why in thunder doesn't that express team show up!"
<br> 
<br> "Say, Tom," and Whittles leaned over the table, "suppose it had been you or me instead of Joe?"
<br> 
<br> "You or me! What do you mean?"
<br> 
<br> "Abner loves us about as much as he loved Joe this morning, doesn't he?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, I see," and the lawyer rubbed his chin in a thoughtful manner. "I never thought of that."
<br> 
<br> "I know you didn't. Now, suppose Abner gets out of jail and learns who gave Joe that information, what then?"
<br> 
<br> Rackshaw shifted somewhat uneasily in his chair, and glanced down at the dog. Then he laughed and picked up the cards he had dropped upon the table.
<br> 
<br> "I guess Abner won't do any more of his wild stunts for a while," he remarked. "He's in deep enough water now. He'll need a lawyer to defend him, and I'm the only one in town."
<br> 
<br> "He won't come to you."
<br> 
<br> "Just you wait. He's in a trap and knows very well that I can get him out; that is, if I want to."
<br> 
<br> "Want to! Won't you want to get him out? Won't you do everything for him that you can if he engages you to defend him?"
<br> 
<br> "That all depends. If he comes to me I'll do all I can under certain conditions."
<br> 
<br> "What are the conditions?"
<br> 
<br> The lawyer bit savagely at his cigar, but offered no explanation.
<br> 
<br> "D—n that express team!" he growled. "What can have happened to it?"
<br> 
<br> "Abner can't afford to engage a lawyer, can he?" Whittles asked, noting Rackshaw's silence.
<br> 
<br> "Why not?"
<br> 
<br> "He hasn't any way of paying, has he?"
<br> 
<br> "He hasn't? What about his farm?"
<br> 
<br> "Farm! Why, that's nothing but a bed of gravel. I wouldn't have it as a gift."
<br> 
<br> "You wouldn't, eh? But suppose the Government should want that same bed of gravel for ballast, what then?"
<br> 
<br> Whittles' eyes opened wide, and he looked enquiringly at the lawyer. Light was beginning to dawn upon his mind.
<br> 
<br> "Oh, I see your game, now," he at length replied. "You hope to get the farm, and turn it over to the Government?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, that's just what I expect to do."
<br> 
<br> "But you'll never do it."
<br> 
<br> "I won't? And why not?"
<br> 
<br> "Abner'll not engage you to defend him. He has little use for you, and you should know by this time what a cranky cuss he is."
<br> 
<br> "Well, if he won't engage me, I shall take up Joe's case."
<br> 
<br> "Do what?"
<br> 
<br> "Didn't you hear what I said? I'll defend Joe."
<br> 
<br> "But how can you? You love Joe about as much as you do Abner."
<br> 
<br> "H'm, that's all right. Joe doesn't know what I think of him. And I guess you've got to learn a few things yet, Hen. You're not as sharp as I thought you were. But, say, here's the express team, now."
<br> 
<br> The next instant the door was pushed open, and a fair-sized box was handed to the lawyer.
<br> 
<br> "What do you mean by being so late?" the latter demanded of the expressman.
<br> 
<br> "Couldn't help it, sir," was the reply. "I'm all mixed up to-night. There's only one team on the road."
<br> 
<br> Rackshaw carried the box to the table, cut the strings, and tore away the paper wrapping. Then he turned to his desk and produced a hammer.
<br> 
<br> "Down, Pedro," he ordered, as the dog began to sniff excitedly at the box. "Surely you're not thirsty, too."
<br> 
<br> "Following his master's example, eh?" Whittles smilingly queried. "Queer box, that."
<br> 
<br> "Queer! I should say so," the lawyer growled, as he began to pry up the cover. "I never got a box like this before. Down, Pedro, I say. What's the matter with the dog, anyway? He's half crazy."
<br> 
<br> Scarcely had he finished speaking when a portion of the cover came off, and at once a big gray rat leaped full into the lawyer's startled face. With a yell of fright Rackshaw let go the box, dropped the hammer, and staggered back. Trying to recover himself, he came into sudden contact with the dog and was hurled over a chair full length upon the floor. He endeavored to get up, and had reached a sitting position when Pedro again landed on him like a catapult. Had a cyclone burst upon that room the confusion could not have been more appalling. Frantic squeals of terrified rats and the snapping yelps of the pursuing dog mingled with the crash of falling chairs and tables. It was, as the lawyer afterwards expressed it, "hell let loose."
<br> 
<br> When Rackshaw was at length able to crawl to his knees he looked around the disordered room. Pedro was still cavorting here and there, first after one rat and then another. Whittles was nowhere to be seen.
<br> 
<br> "Hen, where are you?" the lawyer called.
<br> 
<br> A groan from beneath one of the tables was the only response.
<br> 
<br> "Are you hurt, Hen?"
<br> 
<br> "Dying," was the feeble reply. "For God's sake, call off that dog!"
<br> 
<br> To "call off the dog" was easier to order than to do. Rackshaw staggered to his feet, and shouted wildly to the excited brute. But the louder he called, and the more furiously he swore, the more frantic did the greyhound become. The rats had turned his brain, and he was a crazy fool. Around and around the room he dashed, clearing chairs and tables with great bounds, but not a rat could he catch.
<br> 
<br> Rackshaw started for the door. If he could get it open it would give the rats an avenue of escape. He was but part way across the room when Pedro, attempting to pass through the legs of an overturned chair, stuck fast. With a howl he tried to extricate himself, but in vain. He had now something more than rats to think of, and furiously he threshed from side to side, breaking chairs, and damaging everything with which he came into contact.
<br> 
<br> The lawyer was now desperate. The perspiration poured down his face, while the shouts and curses he hurled at the dog were of no avail. With a savage yank he tore open the door, and the dog, catching sight of the opening, bounded for it like a tank going into battle.
<br> 
<br> It so happened that just at this critical moment the expressman had stepped to the door, carrying in his hands the long-expected box which he had overlooked. He saw the grotesque object bounding toward him, and before he had time to move aside, Pedro, now dragging the battered chair, dashed full upon him. With a yell of terror, he fell backwards, dropping as he did so the precious box upon the pavement. There was a sudden crash of bottles, and a liberal flow of spirits such as the town had never before known.
<br> 
<br> Half dazed, the expressman sat upon the sidewalk, and viewed the shattered box lying in the path of light from the open door. The lawyer approached and stood over the bewildered man.
<br> 
<br> "What's the meaning of all this?" he demanded.
<br> 
<br> "Meaning!" the man replied, rubbing his bruised right shoulder. "Why do you ask me? What's on here to-night, anyway? A menagerie, or a wild-west show?"
<br> 
<br> "Get up, and explain why you brought that box of rats here," Rackshaw ordered, ignoring the other's question.
<br> 
<br> "Rats! Brought rats here! I don't understand."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, rats. That first box you brought was full of rats; big rats, gray rats and all kinds of rats. They've turned hell loose in there."
<br> 
<br> "Good Lord!" the expressman gasped, as he leaned over to obtain a better view of the office. "Did the rats do that?"
<br> 
<br> "Indeed they did."
<br> 
<br> "And was that one of them that knocked me down?"
<br> 
<br> "Get up," Rackshaw commanded. "What's the matter with you? Did you ever see a rat the size of that? Don't you know a dog when you see it?"
<br> 
<br> "A dog! Good heavens! But you said something about rats."
<br> 
<br> "So I did, and you should know something about them, too. You left a box here full of rats, and when I opened it the devils came out and turned my dog's brain. Look at that room there. Isn't it a great mess? Somebody'll have a nice bill to pay. Where in h—l did you get that box, anyway?"
<br> 
<br> "Where I got the rest, of course. I didn't know it was full of rats. But that wouldn't have made any difference. It's not my business to know what the things are which I deliver. Guess you'll have to enquire elsewhere."
<br> 
<br> The expressman rose slowly to his feet, and again rubbed his shoulder.
<br> 
<br> "Darn it!" he growled. "I'm going to sue for damages, see if I don't. If a man can't attend to his business without being half-killed by a mad dog, with a pile of furniture on his back, it's a strange thing."
<br> 
<br> Rackshaw stood and watched him as he climbed up into his waggon, and drove off, grumbling and vowing vengeance upon everybody in general. Then he turned and re-entered the building. He found Whittles sitting on the floor, propped up against the office desk. His hair and clothes were dishevelled, and his face was expressive of his deep misery.
<br> 
<br> "Oh, you've come back, have you?" he meaningly queried.
<br> 
<br> "Sure. Did you think I had run away?"
<br> 
<br> "I couldn't tell. I don't know what to expect next. Is that raging devil gone yet?"
<br> 
<br> "What, the dog?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes."
<br> 
<br> "And the rats? Oh!" Whittles' body shivered.
<br> 
<br> "I guess they've gone, too. I don't see any of them. But get up and act like a man."
<br> 
<br> "I'm nearly dead," Whittles wailed. "I'm sure I'll never get over this. I'm all shaken to pieces, and I believe some of my bones are broken."
<br> 
<br> "Nonsense," the lawyer chided. "Get up, I say, and don't be a fool."
<br> 
<br> "Give me a drop to steady my nerves," Whittles implored. "The expressman brought the stuff at last, didn't he?"
<br> 
<br> "You'll have to lick it up off the sidewalk, then."
<br> 
<br> "What! Was it all lost? Wasn't there a little saved?"
<br> 
<br> "Not a drop. But get up. You're head's turned topsy-turvy."
<br> 
<br> "And everything else as far as I can see. Look at the mess this room is in. Isn't it a fright! Where do you suppose the rats came from?"
<br> 
<br> The lawyer made no reply, but picked up the box lying upon the floor, and examined it carefully. Inside he found a small thin piece of wood containing the following scrawl:
<br> 
<br> "These are country rats. What do you think of them?"
<br> 
<br> He stood for a few seconds, staring at these words. Then the light of understanding flashed upon his mind, and with an oath he tossed the chip to Whittles.
<br> 
<br> "Read that," he ordered. "It will explain matters."
<br> 
<br> A puzzled expression overspread Whittles' face as he read the writing.
<br> 
<br> "Don't you understand it?" Rackshaw asked.
<br> 
<br> "Blamed if I do," and Whittles scratched his head, as he again studied the words. "Who would want to send rats to you, of all men?"
<br> 
<br> "Wouldn't the man who got my 'city rats'?"
<br> 
<br> "What, not Abner Andrews!"
<br> 
<br> "And why not?"
<br> 
<br> "Sure, sure; I might have known."
<br> 
<br> "Known what?"
<br> 
<br> "That you couldn't get ahead of him. He'll get more than even every time. It's the touch of Abner, all right. You might have known what a dangerous cuss he is, the old devil. Rats! Well, I declare! Ugh!"
