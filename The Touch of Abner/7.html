<br> 
<br> The next morning Abner worked at his potatoes. He was not fond of this job, as the weeds were very thick and his temper was none the best. It was hard, anyway, for him to settle down for any length of time to one task. He preferred boating or lumbering, with all the excitement and uncertainty attached to each. But to be penned down in a potato patch was almost more than he could endure. It might have been different if the soil had been productive, but after hard toil there was little to show for all his efforts.
<br> 
<br> "Might as well be in a chain-gang," he meditated, as he tore at the weeds. "It's up one row an' down another, hour after hour. I jist feel wild fer somethin' to turn up. Wish to goodness Ikey Dimock 'ud happen along now. Mebbe he'd git somethin' to-day he escaped yesterday."
<br> 
<br> He paused, leaned on his hoe and looked across the field toward the gravel hill. As he did so his eyes opened wide in amazement, for there right on his land was a man with a strange looking instrument before him. He was pointing it in his direction, too. Maybe it was a gatling gun the fellow had. He had heard about such things. Ikey might have sent him to take the place by force. A fierce anger surged up in Abner's heart, and dropping his hoe, he sped to the house and took down his gun from its rack on the kitchen wall. When Mrs. Andrews asked him what he was going to do, he merely told her that there was a hawk after her chickens. Hurrying from the house, he made his way across the field, clutching his old shot-gun with both hands.
<br> 
<br> He kept his eyes fixed upon the young man, every instant expecting to see him either run or show some sign of terror and beg for his life. But when the intruder merely paused in his work, tipped back his straw hat a little and faced him without the least shadow of fear, Abner became puzzled. If the stranger had only run, it would have been a great lark chasing him across the field, brandishing his gun and shouting wild words of defiance. But to see the man viewing him so calmly upset his calculations. He slowed down, and when a few yards away he stopped and glared savagely.
<br> 
<br> "Why don't you shoot?" the stranger asked, in a matter-of-fact manner.
<br> 
<br> "I'm goin' to," was the reply.
<br> 
<br> "Well, you're a long time about it."
<br> 
<br> "Ain't ye afraid?"
<br> 
<br> "Afraid of what?"
<br> 
<br> "That I'll shoot ye."
<br> 
<br> "Not with that old gun. It wouldn't shoot a cat, and, besides, I don't believe it's loaded."
<br> 
<br> "Want me to try?"
<br> 
<br> "Sure; go ahead. I don't mind."
<br> 
<br> "Ye don't!"
<br> 
<br> "No, not a bit. But hurry up. I'm getting tired waiting."
<br> 
<br> Abner was now in a fix. He never intended to shoot the intruder, but merely wished to frighten him away. He did not know what to do, and only glared harder than ever.
<br> 
<br> "Why don't you shoot?" the stranger again asked.
<br> 
<br> "Hang the shootin'," Abner growled, as he thumped the gun down upon the ground. "De ye think I'm a brute?"
<br> 
<br> "Well, I wasn't altogether sure at first by the way you acted. I've often met brutes on four legs which performed in a similar manner, so I was somewhat puzzled."
<br> 
<br> "An' wasn't there reason?" Abner demanded. "What bizness have ye comin' on to my land?"
<br> 
<br> "What business? Why, my own, of course."
<br> 
<br> "An' what's that?"
<br> 
<br> "Don't you know?"
<br> 
<br> "Surveyin' my place, eh?"
<br> 
<br> "Sure; what did you ask me for, then?"
<br> 
<br> "But who sent ye here? Did Ikey Dimock?"
<br> 
<br> "Ikey Dimock! Let me see," and the young man scratched his head, as if in perplexity. "Say, I can't recall that name. Who is he? A friend of yours?"
<br> 
<br> "A friend of mine! Say that agin an' I'll punch ye'r face."
<br> 
<br> "Will you?"
<br> 
<br> "Sure. I won't stand fer any foolin', mind. Ye'r on my place, an' don't put on any of ye'r high-falutin' airs."
<br> 
<br> "Maybe two can play at that game of punching faces," and the stranger smiled as he straightened himself up a bit. "But I don't want to fight with you. Just let me alone until I get my work finished. If you want a row, go and fight the men who sent me here. Then you'll have all the fighting you can attend to."
<br> 
<br> "Who are they?" Abner queried.
<br> 
<br> "The members of the Government, to be sure."
<br> 
<br> "What in blazes have they to do in the matter, I'd like to know?"
<br> 
<br> "A great deal, as you'll find out. They sent me here, so it's no use to shoot me, or try to punch my nose. I'm only working under orders, and don't count."
<br> 
<br> "But what did they send ye here fer? Tell me that."
<br> 
<br> "To see how much gravel you have; that's why."
<br> 
<br> "Gravel! My gravel?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes. All that hill," and the surveyor motioned to the left.
<br> 
<br> "An' they want it? What fer?"
<br> 
<br> "For ballast."
<br> 
<br> "Ballast!"
<br> 
<br> "Certainly. The wise ones have been very uneasy of late, and have done considerable thinking. They have at last concluded that there is too much gravel right on this part of the earth's surface, and so they've decided to shift a portion of it to keep the old ship steady."
<br> 
<br> "Ye don't tell! An' where are they goin' to take it to?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, just to the new railroad. They need ballast for that, and this is extra good stuff."
<br> 
<br> Abner lifted his old straw hat, and ran his fingers slowly through his hair. His eyes, which had been staring wide, now gradually contracted as he looked off toward the gravel hill. A new light was dawning upon his mind. He was face to face with a problem which he knew would tax his entire supply of "brains, gall, an' luck."
<br> 
<br> The surveyor, observing the expression upon his face, surmised its meaning, and his eyes twinkled.
<br> 
<br> "Catch on?" he drawled.
<br> 
<br> "But where do I come in?" Abner questioned.
<br> 
<br> "Oh, you're in already."
<br> 
<br> "Like the toad in the swill-pail, it seems to me. Not there by choice. But what am I to git out of it? That's what I want to know."
<br> 
<br> "Get out of it! Why, man, you'll be lucky to get out of it alive, same as the toad."
<br> 
<br> "I will, eh? An' why?"
<br> 
<br> "Simply because you've allowed that hill of gravel to remain there to endanger the world. That's about the first thing they'll tell you, and they'll put up such a big talk that you'll be glad to pay out your bottom dollar to help them take the gravel away."
<br> 
<br> "De ye think I'm a fool?" Abner roared, and again his eyes blazed.
<br> 
<br> "Not exactly, though you acted like one a few minutes ago. But I imagine you'll feel like one when that government bunch gets after you. They're past masters at the art of getting what they want. They will come here in autos, parade around the place, puff their expensive cigars, and hand out such talk that you'll feel small enough to crawl through a rat-hole. Oh, I've seen such cases before, and I know just what they'll do."
<br> 
<br> "H'm, I guess ye don't know Abner Andrews, then, not by a jugfull, skiddy-me-shins, if ye do. There'll be no crawlin', mind ye, to them big bugs. An' what's more, they'll never set foot on this place without my consent."
<br> 
<br> "They won't wait for your consent. They didn't send word, I suppose, asking if I might make this survey?"
<br> 
<br> "No, not a line, the skunks."
<br> 
<br> "Neither will they ask permission to tramp over your land. They'll come unexpectedly, the same as I have."
<br> 
<br> "An' they'll go as unexpectedly as they'll come," and Abner stamped upon the ground. "So will you go, young man. I ain't got nuthin' agin you personally, but ye represent that bunch of grafters, so out ye go at once, an' don't ye dare to put ye'r foot upon this place agin without my permission."
<br> 
<br> But the surveyor never moved. With his right arm resting lightly on the theodolite he fixed his eyes steadily upon the farmer.
<br> 
<br> "Ain't ye goin'?" Abner demanded.
<br> 
<br> "No."
<br> 
<br> "Ye ain't! Well, I guess ye'll change ye'r tune, me hearty, before I'm through with ye."
<br> 
<br> Suddenly raising the gun by the barrel with both hands, he drew it back over his left shoulder in a most threatening manner.
<br> 
<br> "Git," he roared, "or I'll knock out ye'r brains, providin' ye've got any."
<br> 
<br> "Go ahead, then," was the quiet reply.
<br> 
<br> "What! ain't ye afraid?" Abner asked.
<br> 
<br> "Afraid of what?"
<br> 
<br> "That I'll kill ye."
<br> 
<br> "H'm, I wish you would. It would save me from doing it myself. So hurry up."
<br> 
<br> Abner's eyes bulged with amazement, and he slowly lowered his gun.
<br> 
<br> "Say, ye'r not luney, are ye?" he queried.
<br> 
<br> "Do you think I am?"
<br> 
<br> "Well, there must be somethin' wrong with a chap who wants to be killed, that's all."
<br> 
<br> "So you're not going to knock out my brains after all?"
<br> 
<br> "Naw, I ain't no murderer."
<br> 
<br> "Too bad," and the surveyor gave a deep sigh. "It's very disappointing."
<br> 
<br> Abner was now completely bewildered, and he knew not what to do. For once in his life he was unable to make any reply. If the young man had shown the least sign of fear, or had even argued, it would have been different. But to see him so calm and unconcerned was what puzzled him. He was mad, and yet it did no good. The more excited he became, the cooler seemed the surveyor. What was he to do? He did not wish to leave the fellow and go back to the house, as that would be an acknowledgment of defeat.
<br> 
<br> Happening to glance away to the left, he was much relieved to see Jess walking across the field carrying a dish of wild strawberries she had just picked.
<br> 
<br> "Hi thar, Jess," he called. "Come here. I want ye."
<br> 
<br> At these words the surveyor turned his head. Seeing the girl approaching, he suddenly straightened himself up from his listless attitude, while an expression of interest dawned in his eyes.
<br> 
<br> Jess was certainly fair to look upon as she drew near to where the two men were standing. It was little wonder that the surveyor's heart suddenly thrilled, and his hand touched his hat. Her trim lithe figure was clad in a simple white dress, open at the throat. Her arms were bare to the elbows, and her fingers bore the crimson stains of the strawberries she had recently picked. Beneath her broad-rimmed hat tresses of wavy dark-brown hair drifted waywardly and temptingly over her sun-browned neck, cheeks and forehead. Her eyes expressed surprise as she glanced at the young man, then at her father, and finally at the grounded gun.
<br> 
<br> "What's the matter, daddy?" she enquired. "You look dangerous."
<br> 
<br> "An' I feel dangerous," Abner retorted. "But that's as fer as I kin git, blamed if it ain't."
<br> 
<br> "But what are you going to do with that gun?"
<br> 
<br> "Nuthin', 'cept tote it back to the house."
<br> 
<br> "What did you bring it here for, then?"
<br> 
<br> "To scare that," and Abner motioned toward the surveyor.
<br> 
<br> Jess looked at the young man and detected an expression of amusement in his eyes, although his face remained perfectly grave.
<br> 
<br> "What did you want to scare him for, daddy?"
<br> 
<br> "'Cause he's trespassin', that's why. He wants to steal our place."
<br> 
<br> "Steal our place!" Jess repeated in astonishment.
<br> 
<br> "Yes, that's jist it. He wants it fer a bunch of government grafters, an' when I threatened to shoot him or brain him he up an' says that he wants to be killed. Now, what de ye make of that?"
<br> 
<br> A new light of animation now beamed in Jess' eyes, and she advanced a step toward the surveyor. Here was a case which demanded her immediate attention, and she felt much elated.
<br> 
<br> "Why do you want to be killed?" she asked.
<br> 
<br> "Simply because there is no reason why I should live," was the reply.
<br> 
<br> "Oh, nonsense," and Jess stamped her right foot lightly upon the ground. "You should not utter such words. Why, a man is a coward who wants to die. It proves that he is afraid to live. Isn't that the truth?"
<br> 
<br> "Perhaps it is. But that's the way I feel, anyway."
<br> 
<br> "You are looking at things in a wrong light," Jess continued. "You need a new outlook on life, a strong, noble view. That is what will lift you out of the depths of despair. You should read 'Above the Clouds.' It is just the book you need, and I shall gladly let you have my copy."
<br> 
<br> "Give it to him, Jess," Abner encouraged. "Pile on the Social Service dope. That'll fix him, all right."
<br> 
<br> "You are too self-centred," Jess went on. "You should not let your thoughts dwell on your own troubles, but think of others and try to help them."
<br> 
<br> "Good advice, young man," Abner chuckled. "Fergit ye'r worries, like a lobster in bilin' water. Go on, Jess; ye'r doin' fine."
<br> 
<br> But Jess did not go on. A sudden embarrassment seized her, caused by the peculiar look she observed in the surveyor's eyes. It was an expression, so she thought, of mingled surprise and amusement. What must he be thinking of her? she asked herself. Her enthusiasm had carried her away. Never before had she spoken to a strange man in such a manner. A deep flush mantled her cheeks, and she glanced nervously around as if anxious to hurry away.
<br> 
<br> "Surely you're not going to leave," the young man remarked. "I am enjoying myself immensely."
<br> 
<br> "You are!" It was all Jess could say.
<br> 
<br> "Certainly. I haven't enjoyed myself so much for a long time. To be held up at the point of a gun; threatened to be brained, and then to listen to such words of wisdom all in one day is most unusual."
<br> 
<br> "Better'n a movie-show, skiddy-me-shins if it ain't," Abner growled.
<br> 
<br> For a few seconds there was a dead silence. Then the humor of the situation dawned upon Jess, and a sunny smile wreathed her face and her eyes danced with merriment. The surveyor's laugh, on the other hand, was like a pigmy explosion. He evidently had been controlling himself with the greatest effort, and this outburst was a welcome relief to his pent-up feelings. Jess, too, laughed heartily now, while Abner's face was twisted into a broad grin, as he thumped the stock of his gun several times upon the ground.
<br> 
<br> "Ho ho!" he roared. "This is a movin'-picture show, all right. Gun, villain, an' gal all here. Why, it beats the movies all holler."
<br> 
<br> Then he stepped up to the surveyor, and held out his hand.
<br> 
<br> "Say, young feller," he began, "put it thar. Ye'r all right, an' I guess ye kin go ahead with ye'r surveyin'. I do sartinly like the cut of ye'r jib. drop around to the house some evenin' an' have a smoke."
<br> 
<br> "Not 'Above the Clouds,' but in them; is that it?" he asked, turning to Jess.
<br> 
<br> "Whichever you prefer," was the reply. "Or you may have both, if you wish," she added as an afterthought.
<br> 
<br> The surveyor watched the father and daughter as they left him and walked slowly across the field. He seemed to be in no hurry to go on with his work, but stood there until the two had disappeared within the house.
<br> 
<br> "And so that is the noted Abner Andrews, is it?" he mused. "And I was told that he wouldn't let me survey his gravel hill. I've won the bet, all right. He certainly is a queer cuss, and I thought at one time that I wouldn't leave this place alive. How in heaven's name does he happen to have a daughter like that? Good Lord, what a girl!"
