<br> 
<br> "I wonder what the critter wants now."
<br> 
<br> "Who is it from?" Mrs. Andrews asked, as she paused in her work of beating an egg for one of her special company cakes.
<br> 
<br> For a few minutes Abner studied the letter he was holding in his hand, and paid no attention to his wife's question. He read it through again very carefully, and when he finished he gave a grunt of disgust.
<br> 
<br> "It must be serious if it makes you feel like that," Mrs. Andrews ventured.
<br> 
<br> "Hey, what's that?" Abner demanded. "Was ye speakin', Tildy?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, I was. But what's the use of my speaking, when you're as deaf as a post. I was merely asking you who's the letter from?"
<br> 
<br> "Why, it's from Lawyer Rackshaw. I thought I told ye."
<br> 
<br> "What does he want?"
<br> 
<br> "He says he wants to see me on very important bizness. But I can't take the time to go to town this fine weather jist to see him. I've got to git to work hayin'."
<br> 
<br> "But you are going to town, anyway, in the morning, daddy," Jess reminded, looking up from the apples she was peeling.
<br> 
<br> "I am, eh? An' what for, I'd like to know?"
<br> 
<br> "Belle is coming on the morning train, and you must meet her."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, Lord!" Abner groaned. "I fergot all about her. Say, Jess, you take Jerry an' go fer her."
<br> 
<br> "I'm afraid I can't, daddy. There is so much work I have to do in the morning that I must stay at home. And, besides, you have to see Lawyer Rackshaw."
<br> 
<br> "So I have, confound it! But how'll I know the gal when I see her, tell me that?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, you'll have no trouble. She has beautiful auburn hair."
<br> 
<br> "Red hair! Oh, my!" and Abner spread out his hands in dismay. "What next? Pink eyes?"
<br> 
<br> "No, no," and Jess laughed. "Not pink eyes, but sparkling dark ones, animated face, and such beautiful white teeth."
<br> 
<br> "Whew! I'll know the red hair, sparklin' eyes, an' animated face, all right, won't I, Tildy? I'll be Abner-on-the-spot as fer as they're consarned. But white teeth! How'll I know they're white? Will I have to ask her to open her mouth good an' wide so's I kin see?"
<br> 
<br> "I guess that won't be necessary," Jess laughingly replied. "As soon as Belle opens her mouth to speak, which she does very often, you will see her teeth, all right. You will know her anyway, for she is sure to be well dressed, and not likely she will be wearing any hat. It's a fad of hers."
<br> 
<br> "No hat! Gee whittaker! I wish you'd do the same, Jess; it'd save a lot of money."
<br> 
<br> Abner rose to his feet, picked up his hat, and reached for his pipe.
<br> 
<br> "I'm goin' over to see Lost Tribes, Tildy," he announced. "I want to know how Widder Denton is makin' out with her kids. Anything ye want me to do before I go?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, you can bring in a pail of water and some wood. You might as well fasten up the chicken-coops, as I am too busy. I wish you'd set a trap, for there was a skunk around last night."
<br> 
<br> "H'm, is that so? Well, I guess it's the bear-trap I'd better set. There'll be more skunks around this place before long, if I'm not mistaken, an' two-legged ones at that. There was one here yesterday, but I soon cleared him out."
<br> 
<br> "Who was that?" Mrs. Andrews sharply asked. "What in the world were you up to?"
<br> 
<br> "It was Ikey Dimock. He was the skunk. He wants to buy our farm fer a summer place. What de ye think o' that?"
<br> 
<br> Abner slipped out of the house before his wife could recover from her astonishment to question him further.
<br> 
<br> "I've given Tildy a jolt," he chuckled, as he moved across the field toward Zeb's house. "I wonder what she'd think of the Dimocks livin' here? Mebbe it'll make her consider the old place is of some value after all."
<br> 
<br> Abner soon returned, harnessed Jerry and drove into town. He was hitching his horse to the post near the station-house when the agent appeared around the corner of the building.
<br> 
<br> "Mornin', Sam," he accosted. "How's the train?"
<br> 
<br> "On time," was the reply. "Expecting anyone?"
<br> 
<br> Abner gave the rope a final yank, and then turned toward the agent.
<br> 
<br> "Say, Sam," he began, "will ye do me a favor?"
<br> 
<br> "What is it?"
<br> 
<br> "Well, ye see, I'm expectin' company on the train this mornin', an' as you're mighty slick with women folks I thought mebbe ye'd meet her, in case I don't git back in time."
<br> 
<br> "Meet who?" Sam demanded in surprise.
<br> 
<br> "Why, Belle Rivers, of course. Didn't I tell ye? She's the 'torney General's gal, an' she's comin' on a visit to our place. I'm here to meet her, but if you'd do it fer me, break the ice, so to speak, I'd consider it a great favor."
<br> 
<br> Sam was all alert now, and keen with interest. The Attorney General Rivers' daughter! What a piece of news he would have for the reporter of The Live Wire when he made his regular afternoon call. The whole town would be agog at the news, and he mentally pictured the excitement of Mrs. Dimock and Mrs. Rackshaw when they heard it.
<br> 
<br> "Will ye do it, Sam?" Abner asked.
<br> 
<br> "Sure, I shall be only too delighted. But how shall I know her?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, ye'll have no trouble. Let me see," and Abner scratched the back of his head. "Jess gave me a full description. She's got hair like fire; eyes like diamonds; cheeks like roses; and teeth like the white of an egg; dresses like one of the fashion picters, an' doesn't wear any hat."
<br> 
<br> "Gee whiz!" Sam exclaimed. "If she's all that she must be worth looking at. And, say, Mr. Andrews, I didn't know you were so poetical."
<br> 
<br> "Poetical! What de ye mean?"
<br> 
<br> "Why, the way you described Miss Rivers. I never heard you use such language before."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, that ain't nuthin' to what I kin do. Ye should hear me when Bill Kincaid's cows break into my oats. Then ye'd know somethin' about my command of the English language."
<br> 
<br> "I guess there wouldn't be much poetry about such language, would there?" Sam smilingly bantered. "A poet, for instance, needs to be inspired, so I understand."
<br> 
<br> "An' de ye think I'm not inspired when I'm chasin' them cows? Tildy says I am, an' I guess the cows do, too, by the way they run. I know I feel inspired, anyway, an' I'm all het up an' excited fer the rest of the day. That's the way poets look when they're inspired, accordin' to the picters I've seen of 'em. But, there, I must be off. Ye'll look after that gal, Sam, like a good feller, won't ye? Show her my waggon there, an' tell her she kin study the sights of the town while she waits. If she's nervous, homesick, or anythin' like that, ye might take her into the waitin'-room. I'll make it all right with ye, Sam. Don't fergit what she looks like, 'specially the red hair."
<br> 
<br> Lawyer Rackshaw was seated at his office desk as Abner entered. He rose briskly to his feet, and grasped the farmer by the hand.
<br> 
<br> "I've just come in," he told him, "and am enjoying my usual morning smoke. Sit right down and have a cigar."
<br> 
<br> "Another ten-center, eh?" Abner queried, as he sat down, crossed his legs, bit off the end of the Havana, and struck a match.
<br> 
<br> "Yes, Mr. Andrews, it's the real thing, all right. I was quite certain you would call to-day, and so had it ready. You received my letter?"
<br> 
<br> "Sure; that's why I'm here. I allus hustle when I git a letter from a lawyer jist the same as I do when a hen hollers, fer then I know a hawk's after her. It's a sure sign there's somethin' important astir."
<br> 
<br> A peculiar smile lurked in the lawyer's eyes as he reached out and picked up a paper lying upon the desk.
<br> 
<br> "I hope this is not a case of the hen and the hawk," he replied, as he tilted back in his chair and bent his eyes on the paper.
<br> 
<br> "Hope not," Abner sighed, as he blew forth a great cloud of smoke. "But, then, one kin never tell."
<br> 
<br> "This has merely to do with the new Orphan Home," the lawyer explained, "and no matter what tricks there might be in other matters, there must be nothing shady in a transaction where poor helpless children are concerned."
<br> 
<br> "Ye're sartinly right," Abner assented. "When it comes to the care of poor little orphans everythin' must be squared with the great Golden Rule, as old Parson Shaw used to say. How's the Home gittin' along, anyway?"
<br> 
<br> "First rate. It's in connection with that I wish to speak to you to-day."
<br> 
<br> "I thought so. Is the buildin' up yit?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, no. It's been such a short time since the meeting that we've been able to do little more than settle upon a suitable situation for the institution. We have given considerable thought to the matter, and are most fortunate in obtaining a plot of ground at a very reasonable cost."
<br> 
<br> "Cost!" Abner exclaimed in astonishment. "Will it cost anythin' fer a piece of ground fer the Home? Why, there's lots of idle land in this town."
<br> 
<br> "But none so suitable as the one we have settled upon. And it is reasonable, too, considering the many advantages connected with it, such as the fine view, and the distance from private dwellings. It will cost us only one thousand dollars for such a situation as that."
<br> 
<br> "One thousand dollars!" Abner almost leaped out of his chair. "Good Lord! Has this town come to that, when it wants one thousand dollars fer a piece of ground fer an Orphan Home! Where is this wonderful spot, I'd like to know, an' who owns it?"
<br> 
<br> "It lies just outside of the town, near the creek, and is a part of the land owned by Mr. Henry Whittles."
<br> 
<br> "What! The dump?"
<br> 
<br> "Well, you see, it's not all dump, as there is more land surrounding it which will make an excellent playground for the children."
<br> 
<br> "An' Hen Whittles wants one thousand dollars fer that?"
<br> 
<br> "He says he is willing to let it go at that sum, considering what it is to be used for."
<br> 
<br> "He is sartinly generous. An' so I s'pose ye want the money I offered to pay fer it, eh?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, if you can find it convenient to let us have it now. As soon as we get the matter of the land settled we can rush the building along."
<br> 
<br> This was more than Abner could stand. His pent-up wrath and righteous indignation could be controlled no longer. Bounding from his seat, he towered above the legal light of Glucom. He thrust out his big right hand toward the lawyer's face, forgetting in his excitement that the fingers of that hand clutched the partly smoked cigar. He hardly realized what he was doing. But the lawyer did, and when the hot end of the cigar came into sudden contact with the tip of his nose, he emitted a yell of pain and lurched violently back in an effort to escape the onslaught. The result was most disastrous, for the sudden recoil sent swivel-chair and occupant backwards upon the floor.
<br> 
<br> With as much dignity as possible the lawyer picked himself up, righted the chair, and sat down again. He was mad, and longed to turn his sharp tongue upon the cause of the disaster. But he was shrewd enough to control his temper, and pretend to make light of the mishap. He would get more than even in due time. But the end of his nose was smarting painfully, and he could not keep his fingers away from the injured member.
<br> 
<br> Abner was at first surprised at the lawyer's sudden collapse. Then a smile lightened his face.
<br> 
<br> "De ye do that every day?" he asked.
<br> 
<br> "Do what?"
<br> 
<br> "Cut up sich capers. Regular mornin' exercise, I s'pose."
<br> 
<br> "Certainly not. Do you think I'm accustomed to having a hot cigar dashed into my nose every morning?"
<br> 
<br> "Well, it's not altogether likely, oh, no. But judgin' by the color of ye'r nose I'd say it's been affected by somethin' more fiery than a hot ten-cent cigar."
<br> 
<br> "Ye do, eh?" The lawyer was visibly irritated now.
<br> 
<br> "I sure do. But that was an inward application, while mine was outward. It was merely a touch of Abner Andrews, of Ash Pint, an' when an' where he touches there's ginerally somethin' doin' which ain't allus pleasant to the feelin's, either."
<br> 
<br> "I hope your touch is not always as hot as the one you just applied to my nose, anyway," the lawyer replied.
<br> 
<br> "Oh, it's a dam sight hotter sometimes, let me tell ye that, 'specially when there's somethin' crooked afoot."
<br> 
<br> "What are you driving at?"
<br> 
<br> "What am I drivin' at? Why, at that Orphan Home affair. It jist twists me all to pieces when I think of Hen Whittles wantin' one thousand dollars fer that dump of his, an' him one of the richest men in Glucom, at that."
<br> 
<br> "But surely you don't expect him to give it for nothing, do you?" the lawyer queried.
<br> 
<br> "An' why not? It's worth nuthin', an' what's more, Hen Whittles should be fined fer keepin' sich a disgraceful place so near town. Every time I drive past that spot I have to hold me nose, the smell is so bad. An' sich a mess of stuff! Tin cans, dead cats an' dogs, an' every blamed thing that isn't of any use is dumped there. It'd take more'n a thousand dollars to clean it up. The Board of Health should git after Hen an' make him squirm like an angle-worm on a hook."
<br> 
<br> "But what are we going to do about it?" the lawyer asked, now greatly annoyed.
<br> 
<br> "Do about it?" Abner roared, rising to his feet. "Why, git a decent place, of course. There's lots of land in town fer that Home without puttin' it on top of a stinkin' dump."
<br> 
<br> "But suppose we can't get any other place?"
<br> 
<br> "Then come to Ash Pint. If the people of this town are as mean as all that, I'll give 'em all the land they want fer the Home. An' it'll be clean land, too, with a great view, plenty of fresh air, an' the river right near where the youngsters kin swim. That's all I've got to say."
<br> 
<br> Abner picked up his hat and started for the door when the lawyer detained him.
<br> 
<br> "Surely you're not going to back down," he coolly remarked.
<br> 
<br> "Back down! On what?"
<br> 
<br> "On the offer you made, that is, the money you promised to give for the Home."
<br> 
<br> "Back down! No! Did ye ever hear of Abner Andrews backin' down? I'm jist buckin' up, that's what I'm doin'. I'm not goin' to give a red cent fer Hen Whittles' stinkin' dump, so you an' the rest of the gang kin chew on that fer a while."
