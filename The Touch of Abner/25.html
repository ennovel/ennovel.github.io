<br> 
<br> "Hello, Lost Tribes!" Abner accosted. "What's the matter? Not sick, are ye?"
<br> 
<br> "Do I look sick?" Zebedee asked, as he took his pipe from his mouth, and glared at his neighbor.
<br> 
<br> "Well, I can't altogether say that ye have the appearance of dyin'," Abner replied, as he sat down by Zeb's side on the workshop steps. "But ye don't look as spry as a skippin' lamb, an' ye'r face ain't as bright as a shiny mug. What's wrong?"
<br> 
<br> "Nuthin'."
<br> 
<br> "H'm, so that's it, eh? It's no wonder ye look glum. Nuthin' wrong! Everythin' runnin' as smooth as molasses in summer time. That's sartinly too bad. Nuthin wrong! What's the nuthin', Zeb?"
<br> 
<br> "You," was the unexpected reply.
<br> 
<br> "Me!" Abner exclaimed in astonishment.
<br> 
<br> "Sure. You're the nuthin', an' it's you that's wrong."
<br> 
<br> "Thanks fer the compliment, Zeb. 'Tisn't every day I git handed one so free an' easy like. What's started ye? Wife cranky, or is it indigestion ye've got?"
<br> 
<br> Zebedee did not deign to reply for a few minutes, but pulled steadily at his pipe, and gazed out over the fields.
<br> 
<br> "Say, Abner," he at length began, "what's the meanin' of ye'r actions, anyway?"
<br> 
<br> "Actions! What actions?"
<br> 
<br> "Why, you ought to know. How many customers de ye expect to have?"
<br> 
<br> "Customers!"
<br> 
<br> "Sure. Haven't ye started store-keepin'? Didn't I see a big truck at ye'r back door last night, loaded with enough goods to keep a lumber camp fer a month?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, I see," and Abner's eyes twinkled with amusement as light began to dawn upon his mind. "Why shouldn't I start store-keepin'?"
<br> 
<br> "Why? Simply because ye would ruin ye'rself in a few weeks."
<br> 
<br> "I would, eh?"
<br> 
<br> "Certainly. Where would ye git the customers, I'd like to know?"
<br> 
<br> "They'd flock from all parts, of course. Half of Glucom 'ud be here in no time."
<br> 
<br> "H'm," Zeb sniffed in disgust. "Ye'r mistaken there, Abner. It wouldn't work."
<br> 
<br> "What'll ye bet?"
<br> 
<br> "I won't bet. It wouldn't be fair."
<br> 
<br> "That's not it, Zeb. Ye wouldn't dare to bet, fer ye know ye'd lose."
<br> 
<br> "Quit ye'r foolin', Abner, an' let's git down to business. Are ye goin' crazy, man, to start store-keepin' in a place like this? Ye can't afford to do sich a thing. If ye have any money to throw away ye'd better keep it fer that trial of yours."
<br> 
<br> "But I need money, Zeb, an' if I can't git it one way I'll have to try another."
<br> 
<br> "Well, leave store-keepin' alone."
<br> 
<br> "I intend to."
<br> 
<br> "Ye do?"
<br> 
<br> "Sure. Never thought of it till ye put the notion into me head. It might be a good scheme, though."
<br> 
<br> "Well, what's all that stuff at your place fer, then?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, that's a gift. Belle's dad sent it fer the kids."
<br> 
<br> "He did!" Zeb's eyes opened wide in amazement.
<br> 
<br> Abner smiled. He was enjoying himself immensely now.
<br> 
<br> "It shook ye'r timbers, did it?" he queried. "Thought I was goin' store-keepin'. No, I don't intend to start that at present. I've somethin' else on me mind."
<br> 
<br> "Ye have? Some more fool-nonsense, I s'pose."
<br> 
<br> "No, this is the real thing, first class an' up to date. I'm goin' to make money hand-over-fist. Listen to this."
<br> 
<br> Fumbling in his vest pocket, Abner brought forth a newspaper clipping and unfolded it with great care.
<br> 
<br> "I cut it from The Family Herald an' Weekly Star," he explained. "Read it last night, an' I've been laffin' ever since. Say, it's a great idea, an' struck me all at once, like that ram did Tom Bentley. Ye ought to read The Herald, Zeb. It tells ye most everything an' what it doesn't tell isn't worth knowin'."
<br> 
<br> "Well, fer pity sakes what is it, Abner?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, haven't I told ye? Why, I thought I had. Here it is, then. It tells about an old feller who lived thousands of years ago, though I can't make out his name. It's a funny one, an' I never heard of that ancestor of mine before. Kin ye give it the right twist, Zeb?"
<br> 
<br> "Spell it, Abner. My eyes ain't good, an' me glasses are in the house."
<br> 
<br> "It's the darndest word I ever sot me eyes on. It goes this way: D-i-o, now that spells Dio. The next is g-e-n; that's gen, all right. The last two letters are e-s, and the hull bunch put together gives us D-i-o-g-e-n-e-s, Dio-genes. Ain't that a whopper, though? I dare say Jess knows the hang of it, but blamed if I do."
<br> 
<br> "Tut, man, I've heard of that feller before. It's pronounced Diogenes," Zeb explained. "Ye'r not so smart after all, are ye, even though ye do read The Family Herald. But what are ye drivin' at, Abner?"
<br> 
<br> "He's one of me ancestors, ye see, an' it's nice to know the hang of his name. It's a great one, isn't it? Diogenes! Gee! that sounds high class."
<br> 
<br> "Ancestors be hanged! What good are sich ancient critters, I'd like to know?"
<br> 
<br> "Look here, Zeb," and Abner looked thoughtfully at his neighbor. "Haven't I been inspired by me ancestors all me life? First the warlike ones overshaddered me, an' then the peaceful spirits hovered round. Now, ain't that so?"
<br> 
<br> "Wouldn't be surprised at anythin'," Zeb agreed. "Ye seem to have sich a dang lot of ancestors that I don't know which ones ye'r goin' to follow next."
<br> 
<br> "I sartinly have, Zeb. That's the time ye hit the nail on the head. I try out one bunch, an' when I git tired of them I shift to another. That's why I'm keen on that old feller, what's his name?"
<br> 
<br> "Diogenes?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, that's him, though I guess you'd better do the pronouncin'. It doesn't seem to come handy to me, nohow. Well, I'm much interested in that old feller I've been laffin', as I told ye, ever since I read that piece in The Family Herald."
<br> 
<br> "What did he do that was so funny, Abner?"
<br> 
<br> "Do! He set the hull world laffin' to split its sides, that's what he did."
<br> 
<br> "In what way? Fer pity sakes, git on with ye'r yarn."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, he sartinly did funny things. He lived in a tub, jist think of that. How would you like to have a tub fer a house, Zeb? Wouldn't it be great! There'd be no house-cleanin' days, an' no carpets to beat, an' sich unnecessary things to attend to."
<br> 
<br> "What did he do in the tub?" Zeb inquired, now becoming much interested.
<br> 
<br> "What did he clo? Why, he made the hull world laff, of course. Wasn't that enough?"
<br> 
<br> "But how did he do it, Abner? I don't see anythin' so funny about that. Anybody could set in a tub, couldn't they?"
<br> 
<br> "Sure. But, ye see, that old feller lived in the tub, ate his meals in it, an' slept there. When folks came to see him he showed 'em his house, kitchen, dinin'-room, parlor an' bedroom, all in one. After they was shown around, so to speak, they nearly all died laffin'. Ye see, they thought he was luney. Then when they stopped laffin' long enough, he up an' says, 'Now jist look at all the things I do not need. It doesn't take much to keep a man goin', does it?' That's what he says."
<br> 
<br> "I s'pose they thought he was crazy, Abner?"
<br> 
<br> "Not a bit of it after that. They had more sense. They called him a philosopher, or some sich name, an they all flocked to see him an' to hear his wisdom."
<br> 
<br> "They did!"
<br> 
<br> "Sure. They came in crowds, an' though they laffed an' laffed at the queer old feller, they paid attention to what he said. Even the king came to see him."
<br> 
<br> "Ye don't tell!"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, Alexander the Great, they called him. He came too, an' he asked the old feller if he could do anythin' fer him. An' what de ye s'pose me ancient ancestor said?"
<br> 
<br> "I couldn't guess."
<br> 
<br> "Sure, ye couldn't, an' no one else. Now, you or me, Zeb, would have asked fer a hull lot of things if the King of England came by an' wanted to do somethin' fer us. We would ask him fer some soft government persition, wouldn't we?"
<br> 
<br> "Most likely we would."
<br> 
<br> "But that old feller didn't ask fer no sich things. He looked at the king, squinted his eyes a little, an' says he, 'Yes, Alec, ye kin do me a great favor.'"
<br> 
<br> "'An' what is it?' says the king, soft an' pleasant like, expectin' to be asked fer somethin' great."
<br> 
<br> "'Ye kin jist stand from between me an' th' sun,' says the old feller. 'Ye'r hidin' the light, an' I feel chilly.' That's what he says to the king."
<br> 
<br> "And wasn't the king hoppin' mad?" Zeb asked.
<br> 
<br> "Mad! Not a bit of it. He grinned, an' went away. I bet ye'r boots he told his wife about it, an' they both had a good laff, the first they'd had, I reckon, fer a long time. Ye see, it did 'em good. That's what they needed to cheer 'em up. An' look here, Zeb, that's what people need to-day. If they'd laff more they'd feel a darned sight better, let me tell ye that. You'd feel better ye'rself, Zeb."
<br> 
<br> "I feel better, already, Abner," was the reply. "I'm jist holdin' me sides to keep from splittin', ye'r story was so funny."
<br> 
<br> "H'm, I guess if ye saw an' heard me when I was real funny ye'd be tied up in a knot in no time. If the spirits of me humorous ancestors got busy there'd be somethin' doin' worth while. An' they're really needed. It 'ud do people a world of good if they could be affected jist fer a day by them wonderful spirits."
<br> 
<br> "What are ye talkin' about, anyway, Abner? What could the spirits of ye'r ancestors do?"
<br> 
<br> "Do? Why, they could cure all kinds of diseases, an make people well an' strong."
<br> 
<br> "Fiddlesticks! Ye'r talkin' nonsense, Abner. How could they do sich things?"
<br> 
<br> "With laffin'-gas, that's how."
<br> 
<br> "Laffin'-gas?"
<br> 
<br> "Sure. Ye see, people don't laff enough. They go round with faces as long as Miss Julie Tomkins' tongue an' that's some length, skiddy-me-shins if it ain't. Most of the folks ye meet now-a-days look as if they was about dyin', or had lost their best friends. They need to be stimulated by a good laff once in a while. It 'ud help their digesters an' make life more pleasant."
<br> 
<br> "An' so ye think ye'r ancestors could make people laff, do ye?" Zeb enquired.
<br> 
<br> "Sartin! They'll work through me, an' I feel 'em gittin' busy jist now. They've given me the power, an' I'm ready to try it upon anybody. Anythin' wrong with you, Zeb? Tooth-ache, stummick-ache, heart-ache, boils, or any dang thing ye might mention. I'm a specialist on all."
<br> 
<br> "Good Lord, no!" Zeb exclaimed. "I know enough of ye'r spirit-movin' business, Abner. Try it on someone else, but I warn ye to leave me alone unless ye want an ache that all ye'r spirits combined couldn't cure."
<br> 
<br> "There now, don't git cranky an' sassy, Zeb. It was only fer ye'r welfare that I offered me services. But if ye won't accept 'em then I'll have to try it on others."
<br> 
<br> "An' de ye think people would come to be treated by you?"
<br> 
<br> "Why not? They want to be cured, don't they?"
<br> 
<br> "I s'pose they do, most of 'em at any rate. But they prefer to go to someone who knows what he's talkin' about."
<br> 
<br> "An' de ye think I don't know? De ye imagine I'm jist spoutin' to hear meself?"
<br> 
<br> "I wouldn't like to say that, Abner. But people wouldn't come to you. They'd laff at you an' call ye a fool."
<br> 
<br> "Let 'em call me whatever they like, Zeb. But they'd laff, an' that's jist what they need, as I told ye."
<br> 
<br> "H'm, I don't doubt about their laffin', providin' they'd come. They couldn't help splittin' their sides when they looked at ye."
<br> 
<br> "An' so ye think they wouldn't come, eh?"
<br> 
<br> "I'm certain they wouldn't."
<br> 
<br> "What'll ye bet?"
<br> 
<br> "Well, I wouldn't bet much with you, Abner, fer ye couldn't stand to lose anythin'."
<br> 
<br> "But I'll not lose. Now see here, I'll bet ye a fig of terbaccer; how'll that do?"
<br> 
<br> "I'll take ye, Abner."
<br> 
<br> "That's right, Zeb, fer I'm hard up fer a plug of terbaccer at this present minute. I'll borrow a little on account, if ye don't mind. Me pipe's gone out."
<br> 
<br> "How de ye plan to start?" Zeb asked, as he handed over a part of a fig of T. &amp; B.
<br> 
<br> "I'm thinkin' of puttin' an ad. in The Live Wire," Abner replied, as he thoughtfully whittled off several liberal slices of tobacco. "Wish ye'd write it out fer me, Zeb. Ye'r good at sich things. Ye often write ads. about ye'r 'Society' pigs, don't ye?"
<br> 
<br> Zeb pulled a note-book and pencil from his vest pocket and told his companion to go ahead.
<br> 
<br> "Go ahead ye'rself," Abner ordered. "Jist say that I'm a specialist on diseases, an' will treat anyone wot comes to me next Saturday evenin' after supper. That's the grain an' you know how to grind it up."
<br> 
<br> After much thought and head scratching Zeb managed to write out an advertisement which he thought would do. Then he read it aloud:
<br> 
<br> DISEASE SPECIALIST
<br> 
<br> "Abner Andrews, of Ash Point, has a new remedy for all kinds of diseases. For the sum of twenty-five cents he will treat all who come to him. Office Hours, Saturday afternoon, from 6 o'clock to midnight."
<br> 
<br> "There, how does that suit ye?" Zeb asked, when he had finished reading.
<br> 
<br> "It's a master-piece, all right," Abner replied. "But haven't ye made the fee rather low?"
<br> 
<br> "Guess it's enough fer the first time. If ye find ye'r rushed ye kin put up the price."
<br> 
<br> "Sure. Anyway, I'll make up in numbers, all right. Better have that terbaccer ready, Zeb, for I'll want it to soothe me nerves when I git through with the gang."
<br> 
<br> "Seems to me ye'r partly paid already, Abner. Ye've pocketed the plug I jist let ye have."
<br> 
<br> "Well, I declare! Good job ye reminded me, Zeb," and Abner chuckled as he handed back his neighbor's property.
<br> 
<br> "I feel so sure of winnin' the bet that I thought I owned that plug. Now ye mention office hours in that ad. Where am I to git an office?"
<br> 
<br> "In ye'r own house, of course. That's the right place."
<br> 
<br> "H'm, I s'pose it is. But, ye see, I'm afraid Tildy an' the gals might object to havin' a crowd around. Let me have this place, will ye, Zeb?"
<br> 
<br> "My workshop!"
<br> 
<br> "Sure. Ye kin sweep it up a bit, an' it'll do fine. Ye won't be usin' it Saturday night, will ye?"
<br> 
<br> "Seems to me, Abner, ye'r gittin' me too much into this affair. I don't want people to think that I've lost me senses, even if you have. But ye'r welcome to the place fer all the good it'll do ye."
<br> 
<br> "Thank ye, Zeb. An' ye'll be sure an' send that ad. to The Wire, won't ye? I'm hard up fer cash jist now. I'll pay ye out of what I make. We'll be pardners, ye see."
<br> 
<br> Zeb looked at his neighbor in astonishment.
<br> 
<br> "Well, if you haven't enough gall to start a vinegar factory then I'll be jiggered," he exclaimed. "Pardners, eh? An' I'm to run the hull durned shootin'-match!"
<br> 
<br> "Don't worry, Zeb," Abner replied, as he rase to his feet. "I'll do all the shootin' that's necessary. But, there, I must git home to dinner. Then I'll have to look after me laffin'-gas. S'long, Zeb, an' don't fergit that ad. Ten cents a line, remember, an' twenty cents fer a header."
