<br> 
<br> There was little wonder that Abner suddenly straightened himself up while an expression of pride beamed in his eyes, as Jess stepped from the train, and hurried toward him. Nature had been kind to this girl of eighteen, and had endowed her with more than an ordinary charm of form and features. Joy and health radiated from her every movement as naturally and unconsciously as an orchard in bloom sheds its sweetness. Her sympathetic nature and impulsive disposition caused her to be beloved by all who knew her, and Jess Andrews was a general favorite. The eyes of several youths followed her closely as she hurried along the platform to where her father was standing.
<br> 
<br> "Have you been waiting long, daddy dear?" she asked, after she had given him an affectionate hug and kiss.
<br> 
<br> "Not overly long," Abner replied, as he held her at arm's length, and viewed her with undisguised admiration. "My you've grown," he added. "Ye look jist like a peach."
<br> 
<br> "Do I?" Jess laughingly asked, as she brushed back a wayward tress of dark-brown hair. "It has been so long since I have seen a peach that I hardly know what one looks like. I wish I had one now, as I am almost starved. I wouldn't look at it long, I can tell you."
<br> 
<br> "Well, let's git home at once," Abner replied. "Ye'r ma has some fine preserved peaches, which she's been keepin' fer ye, an' she wouldn't let me touch 'em. Jerry is over there by that post. I brought the express along this mornin' so's to take ye'r trunk. I'll go an' git it right off."
<br> 
<br> Jess went over and stroked Jerry's glossy neck, and gave him the last chocolate she possessed. It merely whetted his appetite, and he eagerly begged for more, by pawing the ground and thrusting his nose into the friendly hand.
<br> 
<br> "You have a sweet tooth, haven't you, old boy?" and Jess again patted his neck. "You shall have two pieces of candy when I get more, though dear knows when that will be," she regretfully sighed. "I am hard up, Jerry, as I spent my last cent on these chocolates, and don't like to ask daddy for any more money, for I know how difficult it has been for him to pay my bills at the Seminary. But, never mind, when I get to work I shall have plenty. But here comes daddy now."
<br> 
<br> Abner approached, trundling Jess' trunk upon a truck he had procured from the station agent. He dumped his load upon the ground at the rear of the wagon, and then stooped to lift the trunk up into the express. As he did so, the copy of The Live Wire slipped from his coat pocket and fell at his feet. Jess at once stepped forward and picked it up.
<br> 
<br> "Hi, there; what are ye doin'?" Abner enquired, as he suddenly straightened himself up, and looked quickly around.
<br> 
<br> "You dropped this, that's all," and Jess held up the paper as she spoke.
<br> 
<br> "Here, give me that," was the peremptory order. "It's dangerous."
<br> 
<br> "Dangerous! What do you mean?"
<br> 
<br> "It'll cause an explosion, if ye'r not careful, 'specially if ye open it. 'Taint safe."
<br> 
<br> "Why, it's only The Live Wire, daddy! It surely can't do any harm."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, it will, jist as soon as ye open it. There'd be sich an explosion that it 'ud fairly take me head off."
<br> 
<br> Into the girl's eyes came a mingled expression of fear and surprise. What did her father mean by such words? Could there be anything wrong with his brain? He had never acted so strangely before.
<br> 
<br> "Are ye goin' to give me that paper?" Abner asked.
<br> 
<br> "Certainly," Jess replied as she acceded to his request. "But I think you might tell me what makes it so dangerous, daddy."
<br> 
<br> "High explosives, that's what 'tis. It's worse than nitro-glycerine, which goes off jist as soon as ye look at it."
<br> 
<br> "But you should not carry it, then, daddy. If it is not safe for me to touch, neither is it for you, so there."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, I know how to handle it," Abner chuckled, as he thrust the paper back into his pocket. "Climb up now, an' let's be off."
<br> 
<br> "There is something in it you don't want me to see; isn't that it?" Jess asked.
<br> 
<br> "Mebbe there is. Anyway, I don't want to be blown to bits. Whoa, there, Jerry. What's the matter with ye? Take the reins, Jess, an' hold that hoss. He's jist dyin' fer an explosion. I kin tell it by the way he twists his ears."
<br> 
<br> As soon as Abner had hoisted the trunk up into the express, he climbed over the wheel, took his seat by his daughter's side, seized the reins, and headed Jerry for home.
<br> 
<br> "You didn't take the truck back," Jess reminded him as soon as they had started.
<br> 
<br> "Well, neither I did! But, never mind, Sam'll git it. He might as well be doin' somethin', the lazy rascal. It's his bizness to wait on the public, an' we're as much the public as anybody. G'long, Jerry."
<br> 
<br> "My, I'm glad to be back," and Jess gave a deep sigh of contentment. "I never saw the fields look so pretty, nor the trees such a wonderful variety of green. I missed all that at the Seminary. That beautiful maple over there in front of Mr. Sanders' house seems to have grown since I went away."
<br> 
<br> "H'm," Abner grunted, "Joe should cut that down; it hides the view."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, daddy, don't say that. Just think what such a tree means. There is so much in it."
<br> 
<br> "Y'bet there is; more'n a cord of good firewood."
<br> 
<br> "I don't mean that, daddy. I wasn't thinking of the wood, but of the beauty of form and color on golden, summer days, and the mystic music when the wind is rushing through its branches."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, it's them things ye'r thinkin' of. Well, mebbe ye'r right. But a piece of good dry maple in our old stove on a cold day in winter gives all the poetry an' music I want. Guess ye've been studyin' sich things at the Seminary, eh?"
<br> 
<br> "For a time we did. But this last term most of us were greatly interested in Social Service studies."
<br> 
<br> "Ye don't tell! What's that, anyway? A new kind of religion or prayer-meetin', eh?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, no," and Jess laughed merrily. "It is merely social reform, that is, efforts to lessen and remove existing evils."
<br> 
<br> "Well, that's interestin'. Pretty big problem, I should say; almost as hard as clearin' a dog's hide of fleas."
<br> 
<br> "Much harder, daddy. You see, we have to deal with human nature at its lowest, and elevate it step by step."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, now I begin to spy daylight. Ye'r to be a kind of human elevator, sich as they have in big stores, which boosts ye from cellar to garret quicker'n ye kin say 'jack-rabbit.'"
<br> 
<br> "It's something like that, only this is a long and difficult work, needing no end of patience. It means not only fighting such evils as the liquor traffic, horse-racing, gambling, graft and such things, but we must educate people as to the proper training and welfare of children, and teach them how to keep their houses clean and free from diseases. I could not begin to tell you all the subjects Social Service includes."
<br> 
<br> "It sartinly must cover a heap of ground," Abner mused, as he flicked Jerry gently with the whip. "But does it tell ye how to cook, darn socks, sew on buttons, an' do sich ordinary household work?"
<br> 
<br> "Why, no!" and Jess looked her surprise. "It's not supposed to include such things."
<br> 
<br> "H'm, is that so? Well, it seems to me that's the kind of social reform we need. Most of the gals these days tweedle-dee at the pianner, gass about art, study the fashion magazines, an' read the new novels, but as fer cookin', sewin', an' darnin', why, they know no more about sich things than a cat knows about a thrashin' machine."
<br> 
<br> "But I know, daddy," Jess reminded. "Mother taught me, you remember, before I left home."
<br> 
<br> "Sure, she did, an' she larnt ye well, too. She laid the timbers all right, keel, kilson, an' all. But, skiddy-me-shins, if ye'r goin' to carry all that Social Service sail, ye'll be a mighty different craft from what ye'r mother planned. Ye sartinly won't do fer ordinary home waters, let me tell ye that. Ye'll need a darn more sea room than kin be found at Ash Pint."
<br> 
<br> "Certainly, daddy, that's just it. I intend to go to some big city where the needs are great, and help to carry on social reform work."
<br> 
<br> "Ye do!" Abner's hands dropped limp upon his knees, and a troubled expression overspread his wrinkled face. The merry twinkle left his eyes, and the wrinkles upon his bronzed forehead seemed to deepen. "Why, I thought ye was a-goin' to stay home, Jess," he at length continued. "Ye'r ma an' me was settin' great store upon ye'r comin' back, an' castin' anchor at Ash Pint."
<br> 
<br> "I couldn't think of doing that, daddy. And besides, you have already said that I am not fitted for home waters, didn't you? I certainly do need more sea room."
<br> 
<br> "But couldn't ye take a reef or two in ye'r sail, Jess? There's considerable social work to be done right here, so why not cruise around a while in this parish? I guess ye'll find enough to keep ye busy fer a year or two at least."
<br> 
<br> "Why, what can I do, daddy?"
<br> 
<br> "Well, I can't recall all the needs. But there's Glucom, fer instance. It's right handy, an' it needs its back yards cleaned up, an' other things attended to; it sartinly does. Ye might start with Ikey Dimock, an' Lawyer Rackshaw, an' I think ye'd find enough in their cellars an' basements to occupy ye fer a long time."
<br> 
<br> "Why, daddy, I didn't know their places needed looking after. Their wives are leaders of Glucom society, and surely conditions are not as bad as you make out."
<br> 
<br> "I'm not sayin' anythin' about their wives, fer I've learned since marryin' ye'r ma to speak very keerful about women. I was merely referrin' to the men. But, remember, society ain't allus what it seems, fer many a frog kicks up a big fuss an' holler on a rotten log, an' roosters often crow the loudest on a manure heap. I guess if ye knew as much as I do about the way Ikey Dimock an' Lawyer Rackshaw, to say nuthin' of others, made their money ye'd find that I'm not fer astray. G'long, Jerry."
<br> 
<br> "But what could I do with such people, daddy? They would resent any interference on my part. They are leaders of society, you know. We work among a different class of people."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, I suppose so. But ye told me that Social Service work includes the liquor traffic, gamblin', graft, an' sich things, so that's why I mentioned Glucom. It's sartinly a fine field fer operations."
<br> 
<br> "I shall think it over, daddy," and Jess gave a deep sigh. Abner's eyes twinkled, and he glanced toward his daughter.
<br> 
<br> "S'pose ye try ye'r hand at home, Jess," he suggested.
<br> 
<br> "In what way?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, upon me an' ye'r ma. We need a little reformin', an' the old house wants to be made a darn sight more sanitary than it is."
<br> 
<br> "Why, what do you mean?" Jess asked in surprise.
<br> 
<br> "Well, ye see, me an' ye'r ma haven't been sproutin' any extry angel-wings since ye left home, Jess. We've been havin' too much of each other's company, I guess, an' ye know that ye git tired even of the best candy an' chocolates if ye have too much of 'em. Then, we've been livin' in the kitchen, eatin' an' settin' there. We never use the dinin'-room, an' as fer the parlor, well, the blinds have been down fer so long that I have the creeps whenever I go into that room. No, it ain't sanitary. The house needs more sunshine; a cheery voice now an' then, an' some music on that old pianner once in a while. I tell ye the state of affairs at our house ain't nat'ral. A funeral is necessary occasionally, I s'pose, but ye'd think we was havin' a funeral at our house every day of the week. Yes, Jess, we need ye'r social reform work right at home as much as anywheres else. Hello! What's this?"
<br> 
<br> They had rounded the bend in the road when they saw an elderly man approaching, carrying with difficulty a rough box upon his shoulder.
<br> 
<br> "Why, it's Zeb Burns!" Abner exclaimed. "What in the world is he up to now? Hello, Zeb," he accosted, as he pulled up his horse. "Not movin', are ye?"
<br> 
<br> "What de ye think I'm doin', then?" was the retort. "Do I look as if I've been settin' under the shade of an apple tree all the mornin'?"
<br> 
<br> Zeb thumped the box down upon the ground, pulled forth a big red pocket-handkerchief, and mopped his perspiring face. As the box touched mother earth, a piercing squeal sounded forth, followed by several protesting grunts.
<br> 
<br> "Oh, it's a pig ye've got!" and Abner leaned over to obtain a better view. "One of the Chosen Tribes, I s'pose, ha, ha."
<br> 
<br> "No, it's not; it's the devil in pig's clothin'; that's what it is. It's been cussin' an' squealin' an' kickin' ever since I started from home. Guess it must be one of your ancient ancestors, Abner, shut up in this critter, by the way it acts."
<br> 
<br> "Where did ye git the thing, anyway?" Abner enquired. "Didn't raise it, did ye?"
<br> 
<br> "It's a Society pig, ye see," was the reply. "I only got it yesterday, an' sold it at once to Joe Sanders. That's where I'm takin' it now."
<br> 
<br> "Must be some class to that animal, Zeb. Society pig, eh? I s'pose it has all the marks of high life?"
<br> 
<br> "It ought to have. It was riz by the Agricultural Society, and they generally turn out good stuff. But this darn critter is certainly an exception by the way it acts."
<br> 
<br> "Why don't ye try Social Service methods on it, then?"
<br> 
<br> "Social Service methods!" Zeb exclaimed in surprise.
<br> 
<br> "Sure. Reform the thing; elevate it, of course."
<br> 
<br> "Elevate the devil!" was the disgusted retort.
<br> 
<br> "That's what Social Service is fer, though; to elevate the divil, accordin' to what Jess has been tellin' me."
<br> 
<br> "But, de ye think ye could elevate a pig?" Zeb savagely asked.
<br> 
<br> "Don't know. Never tried, except to elevate it by the hind legs after it was killed. But Social Service might work wonders with it, though. As it is a Society pig, it's had a good start, so the rest should be easy."
<br> 
<br> "Ump!" Zeb snorted. "All the Social Service methods in the world couldn't do more than elevate a pig into a hog."
<br> 
<br> "Ho, ho, I guess ye'r right, Zeb. G'long, Jerry."
<br> 
<br> Abner emitted several chuckles as they moved leisurely along the road. Once he turned and looked back just as Zeb was endeavoring to balance the box again upon his shoulder.
<br> 
<br> "Ho, ho," he laughed, "Zeb hit it that time, all right. Ye surely can't change a pig into anythin' but a hog, even though it is society bred."
<br> 
<br> "Wasn't it funny, though?" Jess commented.
<br> 
<br> "What; the pig?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, no. But what Zeb said, and the way he looked. Is he as much interested as ever in the Lost Tribes?"
<br> 
<br> "Sure. Why, he yangs about it every time we meet. We had a regular set-to one day this week."
<br> 
<br> "But he didn't say a word about it this morning, daddy."
<br> 
<br> "Neither he did, come to think of it. He had the pig on the brain; that's why. My, that's a good one on Lost Tribes, an' I won't fergit it next time I see him. To think of Zeb bein' side-tracked by a pig! Hello! There's ye'r ma comin' to meet us, blamed if she ain't. Guess she got tired waitin'. Gid-dap, Jerry."
