<br> 
<br> "It seems to me, Tildy," Abner remarked, "that your breakin' into Society is somethin' like the time I broke through the ice skatin' up river."
<br> 
<br> "In what way?" Mrs. Andrews asked, as she adjusted her hat.
<br> 
<br> Abner was stretched out upon the kitchen sofa, enjoying his evening smoke, and watching his wife as she gave the final touches to her toilet.
<br> 
<br> "Well, ye see," he explained, "my breakin' through the ice was very sudden. It was as unexpected as you goin' to Mrs. Ikey Dimock's party."
<br> 
<br> "And as unpleasant, why don't you say, Abner?"
<br> 
<br> "That's jist what I was a-goin' to say, Tildy. I think your reception will be about as cool as my duckin' in the river. Mrs. Ikey is not anxious to have ye there, not by a jugful."
<br> 
<br> "Don't I know that," snapped Mrs. Andrews. "But you understand as well as I do that the girls wouldn't go without me, and so Mrs. Dimock just had to ask me. I tried to get out of going, but finally had to consent. I'm sure I shan't enjoy myself one bit."
<br> 
<br> "Jist about as much as I did out in the river, with water up to me chin, clingin' to the ice with me fingernails, an' yellin' blue-murder. I hadn't any idea the water was so deep where I went in. Gee whiz! It was easy to go in, but mighty hard to git out. Mebbe that'll be the way with you, Tildy, eh?"
<br> 
<br> "What, do you think I'll want to keep this thing up, Abner? If you do, then you're much mistaken. I'm sick of it already."
<br> 
<br> "That's all right, Tildy. I know ye've got enough common sense not to want to be a society belle at ye'r time of life. But ye see, as Mrs. Ikey has invited you to her party, she'll expect you to do somethin' in return. Society, as I understand it, is jist ordinary trade. Ye don't git things fer nuthin'. Mrs. Ikey invites you, then you must invite her, an' that's the way it goes. How does that strike ye, Tildy?"
<br> 
<br> Before Mrs. Andrews could reply, Belle and Jess entered the kitchen. Abner's eyes brightened as he saw them, and he viewed them with critical eyes.
<br> 
<br> "My, my!" he exclaimed, "you two'll cut a dash tonight fer sure. Why, all the young fellers in Glucom will be tumblin' over one another."
<br> 
<br> "So long as they don't tumble over us we won't care," Belle laughingly replied. "We're not out for conquests, are we, Jess?"
<br> 
<br> "I'm not, anyway," the latter declared. "I haven't any time or inclination to bother with such things."
<br> 
<br> Abner's eyes twinkled, and he turned to his wife.
<br> 
<br> "Guess it's up to you, Tildy, to do the grand tonight. These gals don't want any fellers. But there's the car, so yez better hustle."
<br> 
<br> Abner accompanied the women to the road, and stood watching until the car had disappeared from view.
<br> 
<br> "Well, well," he mused, "to think of Tildy goin' to a party at Mrs. Ikey Dimock's, an' in Mrs. Ikey's ear, at that! What's goin' to happen next? Wonders'll never cease."
<br> 
<br> Abner went back to the house, locked the door, and strolled over to Zeb's. He wished to discuss his big idea with his neighbor, and learn what he thought about it. He remained for over an hour, and when he at length left he was much elated. Zeb had been more reasonable than usual, and had agreed that his idea was a good one, and worth trying.
<br> 
<br> Abner had been home but a short time when he heard a noise at the back door. Then children's voices fell upon his ears, accompanied by a child's cry. Wondering what it could mean, Abner threw open the door, and peered out. It was dark, but not dark enough to prevent his seeing two little figures standing before him.
<br> 
<br> "Hello! Who in time are yez, an' what de yez want at this hour of the night?" he demanded.
<br> 
<br> "Are you our uncle?" a little voice asked.
<br> 
<br> "Uncle! Guess ye've struck the wrong spot this time. Better move on."
<br> 
<br> "But you must be our uncle," the voice insisted. "The man wot left us here said you are our Uncle Abner."
<br> 
<br> "Well, I ain't, so that's the end of it," was the curt reply.
<br> 
<br> At these words the two little creatures broke into a pitiful cry. Abner was helpless and in a quandary.
<br> 
<br> "What are we to do?" came the wailing question. "The man is gone and we're lost."
<br> 
<br> "Lost, eh? Well, come in, then, till I have a look at yez."
<br> 
<br> Quickly the children obeyed, and soon were standing in the middle of the room, two forlorn objects of distress and misery. They were boys, one about seven years of age, the other five. Their clothes were ragged and their faces looked as if they had not been washed for days. But there was something about them that appealed to Abner, whose heart was always affected by the helpless and the unfortunate. The little visitors showed no sign of fear, but stood watching Abner with big, beautiful dark eyes.
<br> 
<br> "So ye're huntin' fer ye'r uncle, eh?" Abner queried.
<br> 
<br> "Yep," the older boy replied.
<br> 
<br> "Yeth," came the other.
<br> 
<br> "Who brought yez here?"
<br> 
<br> "A man."
<br> 
<br> "A man," came the echo.
<br> 
<br> "An' he gave me this," and the boy held out a piece of soiled paper, which he had been clutching in his right hand.
<br> 
<br> Abner took the note, unfolded it, and holding it close to the light, read the following:
<br> 
<br> "Abner Andrews:
<br> 
<br> "If you are determined to have a Home at Ash Point, you can begin work at once. Here are two young town rats for your care. What do you think of them?"
<br> 
<br> That was all, and as Abner stood staring at the note, the light of comprehension dawned upon his mind. In fact he stood there so long that he forgot the waiting lads. He was aroused, however, by a light touch upon his arm, and a tired voice saying,
<br> 
<br> "We're hungry."
<br> 
<br> "We're hungry," came the response.
<br> 
<br> "Sure, sure, indeed yez must be hungry," Abner replied, as he turned quickly around. "Rats are allus hungry, but yez must git some of that scum off ye'r faces an' hands before yez eat in this house. Come over here to the sink."
<br> 
<br> After a vigorous application of soap and water, the waifs presented a more respectable appearance, and Abner stepped back and viewed them critically.
<br> 
<br> "There," he panted, "guess that'll do fer the present. But yez sartinly need a hoe an' a scrabbin-brush upon ye'r mugs. An' say, what's ye'r names?"
<br> 
<br> "Mine's Tom," the older boy replied, "an' his is Billy."
<br> 
<br> "Tom an' Billy, eh? But Tom an' Billy what? What's ye'r other names?"
<br> 
<br> "Ain't got any. Jist Tom an' Billy."
<br> 
<br> "Jith Tom an' Billy," came the echo.
<br> 
<br> "Yes, I know that. But what's ye'r mother's name?"
<br> 
<br> "Sue."
<br> 
<br> "Thue."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, git out, that's not what I want to know. What do people call her?"
<br> 
<br> "Lazy."
<br> 
<br> "Lathy."
<br> 
<br> With a sigh of despair Abner gave up the attempt to gain any more information, and went into the pantry. After he had fumbled about for some time, and knocked down a number of pans and dishes, he returned with two big slices of bread covered with butter and molasses.
<br> 
<br> "There, fall to," he ordered, "an' help ye'rselves."
<br> 
<br> The children needed no second bidding. They were ravenous, and ate more like dogs than human beings. Not until they had devoured the third helping were they satisfied, and breathed a sigh of relief. Tom wiped his sticky mouth with his coat sleeve, and Billy did likewise.
<br> 
<br> "Yez needn't paint ye'r sleeves with molasses," Abner chided. "But I guess by the look of things they're the only napkins yez ever use. Git over to the sink there, till I give yez another scrubbin'."
<br> 
<br> When the molasses had been wiped away, Tom gave a deep yawn.
<br> 
<br> "I'm sleepy," he announced.
<br> 
<br> "Theepy," lisped Billy.
<br> 
<br> "Sleepy!" Abner fairly gasped the word, as he looked helplessly around. What was he to do? He could not think of sending the waifs out into the night, and where was he to put them to sleep?
<br> 
<br> "Confound it!" he muttered. "Wish to goodness the women folks was home; they'd know what to do. Jess'd have a chance to try out her Social Service plan. Wonder what she'd do? Mebbe she'd take 'em to sleep with her."
<br> 
<br> He paused, his face brightened, and his eyes twinkled.
<br> 
<br> "Say, kids, come with me," he ordered. "I'll fix yez up fer the night. Ye'r uncle won't send yez away, not by a jugful, skiddy-me-shins, if he will."
<br> 
<br> Picking up the lamp, he strode through the dining-room into the hall-way, and up the stairs, closely followed by the boys. Reaching the top, he opened a door to the right, entered the room, and placed the lamp upon the dressing-table. Tom and Billy stared around the room with undisguised wonder, for it seemed to them like fairy-land.
<br> 
<br> "Hurry up an' strip," Abner commanded.
<br> 
<br> But alas! there was little to strip, for when the lads had removed their outer clothing, there was little underneath except rags.
<br> 
<br> "Holy smoke!" Abner exclaimed. "Is that all yez have on? Well, I declare! I can't see nuthin' but holes. But yez can't go to bed with them things on. Peel off them rags at once, while I look around fer somethin' fer yez to put on."
<br> 
<br> When the lads had obeyed and had wriggled out of their rags, Abner seized a quilt from the bed and wrapped it about their bodies.
<br> 
<br> "Jist hold that close," he ordered, "while I look around fer some duds. Let me see," and he scratched his head in perplexity. "I wonder where Tildy keeps sich things."
<br> 
<br> Going into an adjoining room, he pulled out several bureau drawers, and in a few minutes returned carrying triumphantly two spotless pillow-slips in his left hand. Replacing the lamp upon the dresser, he held the slips up for careful inspection.
<br> 
<br> "Pity to do it," he mused, "but it can't be helped."
<br> 
<br> Drawing a jackknife from his pocket, he opened it and deliberately began to cut open the end of one of the slips, and also a hole in each side.
<br> 
<br> "Now come here, youngster, you big one, an' stand up straight."
<br> 
<br> Abner at once dropped the slip over the boy's head, and made him put his arms through the holes in the sides. The gap in the top was small and the boy's head stuck half way. This was overcome by Abner, who yanked down the slip, which ripped wider, and then flopped down over Tom's tousled head and brought up on the little shoulders.
<br> 
<br> "There now, guess that'll do all right for a nightgown," was Abner's comment, as he stepped back and viewed his work. "Ye'r surely a queer lookin' bird, but it's better'n nuthin'."
<br> 
<br> Billy was treated in a similar manner, and when he, too, was robed in another of Mrs. Andrews' pillow-slips, Abner was quite satisfied.
<br> 
<br> "Now, say ye'r prayers," he ordered.
<br> 
<br> During the whole of this performance the waifs had not uttered a word. They had been too much taken up with their strange surroundings, and with watching their "uncle." They imagined that he was about to play some new game with them, and when he ordered them to say their prayers they both grinned in anticipation of the game they were expecting.
<br> 
<br> "Say ye'r prayers, I tell yez," Abner again ordered.
<br> 
<br> "We don't know that game," Tom explained.
<br> 
<br> "We don't know thad game," Billy echoed.
<br> 
<br> "Game!" Abner roared. "De ye think sayin' ye'r prayers is a game?"
<br> 
<br> "Don't know; never played it."
<br> 
<br> "Never played it," responded Billy.
<br> 
<br> "Didn't ye'r mother never learn yez ye'r prayers?"
<br> 
<br> "No. Guess she didn't know the game."
<br> 
<br> "Geth she didn't know the game."
<br> 
<br> Abner sighed and looked helplessly around.
<br> 
<br> "Well, I never!" he ejaculated. "An' this is a Christian land! S'pose I'll have to leave that to Jess. It'll be a part of her Social Service work. So git into bed with yez, an' don't let me hear a whimper out of yez till mornin'."
<br> 
<br> Abner went downstairs and out into the kitchen. Having filled and lighted his pipe, he picked up the note which had been lying on the table, and read it again most carefully. Then stretching himself out comfortably upon the sofa, he gave himself up to earnest thought. He remained thus for about an hour. Then he arose and going to the woodhouse brought in a large wire-cage rat-trap. This he baited with considerable care, and, taking it outside, placed it near the pig pen.
<br> 
<br> "There, guess I ought to have one or two big fellers by mornin'," he chuckled. "It takes more'n one to play a game, an' there's mighty good reason why Abner Andrews, of Ash Pint, should have a hand in this game which Lawyer Rackshaw has started."
