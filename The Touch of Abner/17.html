<br> 
<br> It seemed to Abner that all his friends had forsaken him. He paced up and down the room outside his cell most of the evening. The chauffeur was asleep, and his deep breathing was the only sound which broke the intense stillness which prevailed. The nap he had taken that afternoon drove all sleep from Abner's eyes. In fact, he could not have slept, anyway, as the story the chauffeur had told gave him food for much thought. So Rackshaw was at the bottom of it all, he mused. He had surmised as much, but he had no means of proving it until he had heard it from the lips of the wild-eyed youth. Perhaps the lawyer was responsible, too, for the article in The Live Wire. How could the editor have obtained the information unless someone had communicated with him? The police, of course, could have done so, but they would not have twisted the story beyond all semblance of reality. He felt that Joe Preston was guilty, and deserved all that he had received. But was Rackshaw in league with him?
<br> 
<br> He was lost in such thoughts when he heard the jailor's approaching footsteps. The man was coming, no doubt, to lock him in his cell for the night. The thought of being confined in that narrow stuffy place for long hours angered him, so when he heard the key rattle in the lock he was in a most dangerous frame of mind. Accustomed as he was from childhood to unbounded freedom, and an abundance of fresh air, this close confinement in such poorly-ventilated quarters was most galling. He had started to walk back to the other end of the room as the key turned in the lock. He could hardly trust himself then, and he needed a few seconds to calm his feelings.
<br> 
<br> As the door swung open the jailor called to him, and demanded why he was running away. Fiercely Abner wheeled around, but the words of wrath which were glowing hot on his tongue suddenly cooled when he beheld Zeb Burns standing before him. For an instant he stood as if he had seen an apparition, staring hard at his neighbor. Zeb saw the look of astonishment, and the faint semblance of a smile lurked about the corners of his mouth.
<br> 
<br> "What's the matter, Abner?" he asked. "Ye look scared."
<br> 
<br> "So I am."
<br> 
<br> "What about?"
<br> 
<br> "You."
<br> 
<br> "Me! Why are you scared about me?"
<br> 
<br> "What have ye been doin', Zeb?"
<br> 
<br> "Doin'! What de ye mean?"
<br> 
<br> "But why are ye here? Have they got you, too?"
<br> 
<br> "Ho, ho, I see," and Burns laughed outright. "Ye think that because you're in the Klink everybody else is headin' the same way. But I guess there are a few sensible people left yit in the world, which is a mighty lucky thing."
<br> 
<br> "An' they're not goin' to lock you up too?" Abner asked in surprise. "Ye haven't been beatin' anybody up, eh?"
<br> 
<br> "Certainly not. What's the matter with ye, anyway, Abner? I'm here to take you out of this hole, so git a hustle on an' come with me at once. There now, never mind talkin'," he added. "We've got lots of time fer that later. I want to git away."
<br> 
<br> Like a child Abner followed Zeb out of the jail, and not until they had reached the street did he open his lips. Then he stopped, looked around, and drew in a long, deep breath of fresh air.
<br> 
<br> "My, that feels good!" he exclaimed. "The Lord never meant a man to be shut up in a place like that."
<br> 
<br> "I know he didn't," Zeb replied. "Neither did He intend that a man in his common sense should act the fool."
<br> 
<br> "De ye think I have?" Abner demanded.
<br> 
<br> "It looks very much like it. But, let's hurry up. I guess the judge will settle whether you are a fool or a lunatic, so it's no use fer us to spend our time arguin' about it."
<br> 
<br> "Where are ye goin'?" Abner asked.
<br> 
<br> "Home, of course. Where else would we go?"
<br> 
<br> "Did ye walk to town, Zeb?"
<br> 
<br> "Sure; I've no other means of conveyance, have I?"
<br> 
<br> "An' ye're goin' to walk home?"
<br> 
<br> "Guess so from present appearance."
<br> 
<br> "But Jerry's here," Abner explained. "Sam must know where he is."
<br> 
<br> "That's good. We'll hustle there at once an' git the old nag."
<br> 
<br> They moved rapidly along the street leading to the railway station. This route led them by Rackshaw's office, and as they were about to pass they glanced in at the open door. The sight which met their eyes filled them with astonishment, causing them to stop and look into the room. To Zeb the scene of chaos was puzzling, but Abner surmised the cause in an instant. His face brightened, and his mouth expanded into a grin when he saw Whittles upon the floor and the lawyer standing before the box.
<br> 
<br> "Evenin', gentlemen," he accosted, "an' may the Lord fergive me fer miscallin' yez. Havin' a pink tea, eh?"
<br> 
<br> Rackshaw stood staring at Abner as if he could not believe his eyes.
<br> 
<br> "Good Lord!" he ejaculated. "Are you that devil, Andrews, or his ghost? I thought you were in jail."
<br> 
<br> "H'm," Abner sniffed. "I'm St. Peter now. This is me angel in the shape of Zeb Burns, who came to-night an' brought me out of prison. Look's to me as if you an' Hen have been holdin' a prayer meetin'. Guess ye'r prayers must have been answered, fer here I be."
<br> 
<br> "You're no saint," Rackshaw roared. "You're Beelzebub, the prince of devils; that's who you are. What did you mean by sending me those rats?"
<br> 
<br> "Rats!" and again Abner grinned. "Oh, I see," and his eyes surveyed the room. "Country rats, eh?"
<br> 
<br> "Indeed, they were," was the emphatic reply. "And look what they've done to my office. You'll have a nice sum to pay for all this damage."
<br> 
<br> "Me! Me pay?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, you I mean!" the lawyer yelled, now fairly beside himself. "You are the cause of all this, an' I'll skin you alive, see if I don't, you miserable devil."
<br> 
<br> The grin vanished from Abner's face, his form suddenly straightened, and his eyes blazed. Walking slowly across the room, he stood before the angry lawyer.
<br> 
<br> "Jist say them words agin," he warned, in that drawling tone which betokened danger. "If ye're thinkin' of skinnin' me alive, as no doubt ye'll try to do, I might as well have my full satisfaction now. I'm in deep water as it is over Joe Preston, an' I feel jist in the mood to have another scalp scored to my credit. Another skunk like you won't make much difference, so jist say them words agin, will ye?"
<br> 
<br> Rackshaw was in a trap and knew it. His body shook and his eyes blazed fire. But he was an arrant coward, and the huge form bulked very large before him just then. He knew that Abner would not hesitate to deal with him as he had with Joe Preston, and he did not relish the thought of going to the hospital for repairs. As the two men thus faced each other, Zeb approached and laid a firm hand upon Abner's arm.
<br> 
<br> "Come along out of this," he commanded. "You're in enough trouble now. Don't be a fool. I'm losin' faith in this ancestor business of yours. St. Peter never acted like you're actin' to-night."
<br> 
<br> For an instant only Abner hesitated. He did long to give the lawyer something that was coming to him. But he knew that Zeb was right, and he followed him to the door. He couldn't refrain, however, from giving a parting shot ere he left.
<br> 
<br> "Don't fergit, Rackshaw," he reminded, "that country rats are not to be fooled with, no matter whether they walk on four legs or two. Keep ye'r city rats where they belong, and let them mind their own bizn'ess, an' ye'll have no trouble with country rats."
<br> 
<br> "Fer heaven's sake, hold ye'r tongue, an' come along," Zeb ordered. "I'm sick an' tired of all this confounded fuss."
<br> 
<br> "But would ye put up with sass from a thing like that?" Abner asked. "I wish I had punched his head."
<br> 
<br> "It's lucky ye didn't."
<br> 
<br> "Why?"
<br> 
<br> "You ought to know as well as I do. What kin you do aginst a lawyer? He'll make it hot fer you as it is. I don't know what's comin' over ye, Abner. I always knew that you were a queer critter, but I thought ye had some brains left."
<br> 
<br> For a wonder Abner made no reply, but walked along silently until the station house was reached. It was locked, and Sam was nowhere to be found. Upon enquiry from a man who was standing upon the platform, they learned that the agent had gone to a party out in the country, and had taken Jerry with him.
<br> 
<br> "Confound that feller!" Abner growled. "What right has he to run off with my hoss, I'd like to know?"
<br> 
<br> "He looked after him, though, when you were in the pen, didn't he?" Zeb queried.
<br> 
<br> "Sure, sure he did, an' I s'pose I must fergive him."
<br> 
<br> "Now you're beginnin' to talk like a reasonable man, Abner. It's the first sensible thing I've heard ye say to-night. But we've got to git home, so I guess there's nothin' else to do but to foot it. What de ye say?"
<br> 
<br> "I'm game, so let's git on."
<br> 
<br> They made their way through the town, and when they were at last out into the country, they filled and lighted their pipes as they trudged along. So far little had been said, but the soothing effect of the tobacco seemed to make them more communicable, and they discussed the affairs of the evening. Abner was unusually fierce in his denunciation of everything in general. He believed that he had been unjustly treated, and he longed for suitable retaliation. Zeb listened to him for some time without arguing. He knew that Abner must unburden his soul before he could feel better. At length, however, he stopped and laid his hand upon his companion's sleeve.
<br> 
<br> "Look here, Abner," he solemnly began, "I don't like ye to talk that way. It doesn't do any good."
<br> 
<br> "But it does me a lot of good to blow off steam," Abner retorted.
<br> 
<br> "Yes, mebbe it does. But remember, there's a great difference between blowin' off steam and bustin' ye'r biler, an' that's what you're in danger of doin'."
<br> 
<br> "But de ye think I'm goin' to put up with a hull bunch of rogues who are tryin' to down me?"
<br> 
<br> "An' ye'r helpin' them with ye'r actions, ain't ye?"
<br> 
<br> "What else am I to do? They'll walk over me rough shod if I don't put up a fight. If ye run away from a little snappin' cur he'll run after ye, an' bite ye'r heels, an' bark like mad. But turn around, face the critter, an' give it a good kick, an' then ye'll see how it'll scoot away with its tail between its legs."
<br> 
<br> "But suppose it isn't a cur, Abner, but a big bulldog, what then?"
<br> 
<br> "Why, I'd use a stick, or mebbe somethin' else."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, that's jist it. You'd do somethin' that ye'd regret all ye're life. Now, look here. You've got to stop all this. What you need is a change of heart."
<br> 
<br> "Change of heart!" Abner repeated. "Good Lord, what de ye mean by that? Ye haven't been attendin' a revival meetin', have ye, Zeb?"
<br> 
<br> "No, I haven't, an' don't intend to. But common sense tells me that a man won't accomplish much in this world when he is always rubbin' people the wrong way. Even a cat won't stand it fer long."
<br> 
<br> "The way I rubbed Rackshaw, Ikey Dimock an' Joe Preston, eh?" Abner asked.
<br> 
<br> "That's what I mean. It makes the sparks fly, an' soon there's a big fire which is hard to put out."
<br> 
<br> "What de ye expect me to do, then?"
<br> 
<br> "Rub people the other way, fer instance, and see how it'll work."
<br> 
<br> "Ho, ho," and Abner laughed outright. "Imagine me rubbin' Ikey Dimock an' Rackshaw, an' pattin' 'em on the back an' callin' 'em 'me dear friends.' No, I guess I'm too old a bird fer that. Never had the trainin', ye see. Anyway, it's no use now; it's too late. Everybody's dead set aginst me, an' is tryin' to do me."
<br> 
<br> "Everybody is not, Abner. I'm not, anyway, or else I wouldn't have taken all the trouble to walk to town to git ye out of jail."
<br> 
<br> "Sure, sure, I know you'd stand by me, Zeb. But, say, how did ye do it?"
<br> 
<br> "Do what?"
<br> 
<br> "Git me out of jail, of course."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, bailed ye out, that was all."
<br> 
<br> "But where did ye git the money?"
<br> 
<br> "Never mind where I got it. That's my own business, so don't say anythin' more about it."
<br> 
<br> Abner was silent for a few minutes as he plodded along.
<br> 
<br> "Say," he presently began, "does Tildy an' the gals know about this?"
<br> 
<br> "Can't say fer sure," was the reply. "But I don't believe they do. I jist heard of it by chance, but I never said a word to ye'r folks."
<br> 
<br> "That's good of ye, Zeb." And once more Abner became silent.
<br> 
<br> The night was dark, and when the men were about a mile from their homes it began to rain, first a gentle drizzle, then a steady downpour. They hastened their steps, but the roads became muddy and slippery, which made progress slow.
<br> 
<br> "Say, Zeb," Abner at length panted, "an' ye really think I need a change of heart?"
<br> 
<br> "Don't ye think so ye'rself?" was the evasive reply. "Is this rain softenin' ye up? It is me, at any rate, an' I'm gittin' soaked."
<br> 
<br> "But how kin I begin the change, Zeb?"
<br> 
<br> "Guess ye'll have to work out that sum ye'rself, Abner, if it's not too hard."
<br> 
<br> "Now, that's jist the trouble. It is too hard. Ye see, me ancestors are to blame. They were all fightin' men, an' so that spirit has come down to me."
<br> 
<br> "H'm," Zeb sniffed. "The trouble with you is that ye've chosen ye'r own ancestors."
<br> 
<br> "Chosen me own ancestors! How could a man do that?"
<br> 
<br> "Easy enough. Ye've got a quarrelsome spirit, Abner, an' ye naturally choose sich dead men as suit ye. Ye kin go to the past fer anythin', it seems t' me, jist as people go to the Bible to find what agrees with their way of thinkin'. Now, isn't that so?"
<br> 
<br> "But what am I to do, Zeb?"
<br> 
<br> "Think of men who have followed peace instead of war; men who have served their country an' sacrificed themselves. If ye kin do that, perhaps ye'll git their spirit, which, in my opinion, will do ye a great deal of good."
<br> 
<br> "Mebbe ye'r right, Zeb," Abner agreed. "But darn it all, I don't know nuthin' about men of peace who sacrificed themselves fer others. I've already sacrificed much fer Glucom by lookin' after Joe Preston. If that wasn't a good deed fer the welfare of the community, then I'd like to know what it was."
<br> 
<br> "But ye'r heart wasn't right, Abner," Zeb explained. "There was anger there, an' when ye knocked Joe out ye never thought of the public good, but of ye'r own personal injury. That's not the way. Git them good ancestors to work, then ye'll know what I mean, an' ye'll begin to rub people the right way. Life will be much more pleasant, see if it isn't."
<br> 
<br> "Good ancestors, rubbin' people the right way," Abner muttered, as he plodded along. "I'd like to know how to begin, skiddy-me-shins if I wouldn't."
