<br> 
<br> Abner was unusually silent at dinner and did not seem to notice the neatly set table, nor the fresh wild flowers artistically arranged in the little vase in the centre. He glanced occasionally at his daughter who was sitting opposite, and his eyes shone with pride. He would have been less than human had his heart not thrilled at the vision before him. Jess was in her brightest mood. Her face glowed with abounding health, and her dark eyes beamed with animation as she talked with her mother about her plans for the future, and of the approaching visit of Isabel Rivers. Mrs. Andrews, too, was in excellent spirits, for the finishing touches had been given to the house that morning, and everything was in readiness for the visitor. She nevertheless noted her husband's preoccupied air, and wondered what was troubling him.
<br> 
<br> When dinner was over Abner pushed back his chair, and gave a deep sigh.
<br> 
<br> "What's the matter with you, Abner?" his wife asked. "You don't seem to be yourself to-day. You're not sick, I hope."
<br> 
<br> "Do I look sick, Tildy?"
<br> 
<br> "Well, no, judging by the dinner you ate. But you act like a sick man for all that. Maybe it's your liver."
<br> 
<br> "No, it ain't me liver; it's me heart. That's what's the matter."
<br> 
<br> "Your heart!" Jess exclaimed. "Why, daddy, I didn't know you had heart trouble."
<br> 
<br> "Ye didn't, eh? Well, I had it once, jist about the time I asked ye'r mother to marry me. It was a mighty bad dose."
<br> 
<br> "H'm, you soon got over it," Mrs. Andrews retorted.
<br> 
<br> "I sure did, Tildy. Ye'r right there. It didn't take long after we got hitched, an' I thought I'd never have another attack."
<br> 
<br> "What brought it on now, for pity sakes, Abner? It can't be a woman this time."
<br> 
<br> "It sartinly is."
<br> 
<br> "A woman!"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, a woman; a livin' female woman, an' a widder at that."
<br> 
<br> "Good gracious, Abner! A widow! What do you mean, anyway?"
<br> 
<br> "Jist what I said; a widder, an' she's the one who's given me the heart kink this time."
<br> 
<br> At these words a startled look came into Jess's eyes, and her face grew suddenly pale. But Mrs. Andrews showed no signs of uneasiness. She knew her husband too well to be shocked at anything he might say or do.
<br> 
<br> "Well," she remarked, "whoever that widow is, she's welcome to all the heart you've got, Abner. If she can find it, then it's more than I can."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, it's a widder," Abner continued, unheeding his wife's sarcasm, "an' she's got five kids, an' they're worrin' me a lot."
<br> 
<br> "I should say they would, Abner. You'll have more than one kink in your heart if you undertake to handle such a brood. When do you expect to take charge of your new family?"
<br> 
<br> "Take charge! Did I say anything about takin' charge?" and Abner glared at his wife. "I only said me heart aches fer 'em, an' it sartinly does, fer they're starvin'."
<br> 
<br> "Starving!" Jess exclaimed. "Who are they, anyway?"
<br> 
<br> "Widder Denton an' her brood; that's who they are. Her little boy died yesterday, an' Lost Tribes is makin' a coffin fer him."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, daddy, I hadn't any idea there was such need so near home, did you?"
<br> 
<br> "I sure didn't. But it's Gospel truth. Widder's sick, an' kids starvin'."
<br> 
<br> "Isn't it awful!" and Jess clasped her hands before her. "Can't anything be done for them? The children should be looked after at once, and someone should stay with Mrs. Denton."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, I guess the neighbors'll attend to that fer a while. Zeb'll find out, no doubt."
<br> 
<br> "Isn't the Orphan Home ready yet, daddy?"
<br> 
<br> "What Orphan Home?" and Abner looked keenly into his daughter's face. "What have ye heard about it?"
<br> 
<br> "Nothing much, only I thought they were building one at Glucom. There was some talk about it, wasn't there?"
<br> 
<br> "Talk! Sure there was talk. They've been talkin' about it fer years, but I guess that's as fer as it'll go. But there, I must git at them pertaters."
<br> 
<br> Abner gave a fleeting glance at his wife, picked up his hat and left the room.
<br> 
<br> "What is the matter with, daddy?" Jess asked, after her father had gone.
<br> 
<br> "In what way?" Mrs. Andrews enquired.
<br> 
<br> "I hardly know, except that he seems strange at times. The day I came home he got so excited when I picked up a copy of The Live Wire which had dropped from his pocket."
<br> 
<br> "He did! What did he say?"
<br> 
<br> "He shouted at me and made me give it back to him at once. He said it was dangerous, and that if I looked at it there would be a terrible explosion. I told him there must be something in it that he did not want me to see, and he did not deny it. Have you seen it, mother?"
<br> 
<br> "No, he didn't say anything to me about it. I never knew that he brought the paper home. I wonder where he put it."
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Andrews believed that she knew the cause of her husband's excitement over The Live Wire, and what it contained. But she felt annoyed that he had not shown it to her. Was there something in it that he did not wish her to see? she asked herself. The more she thought about it the more determined she became to find out where Abner had hidden the paper. She said nothing, however, to Jess about it, but discreetly changed the subject, and began to talk about Widow Denton and her troubles.
<br> 
<br> While the women thus lingered at the table and talked, Abner was busy in his potato patch back of the barn. The weeds were thick and stubborn, but he seemed to take a special delight in tearing them out of the ground. "Give me somethin' to shake me timbers an' I kin work like the divil," he had often said. "I kin never accomplish as much in hayin' time as when a thunderstorm is racin' down the valley. I'm somethin' like me old Flyin' Scud. When it was calm she wasn't worth her salt, but let a gale hit her, an' my! how she'd gather her skirts an' run."
<br> 
<br> Seldom had Abner such thoughts to agitate his mind as on this fine warm afternoon. He was deeply concerned about the Denton affair, and this naturally turned his attention to the proposed Orphan Home. He was fully aware that this case of destitution would revive a greater interest in the building of the institution, and that he might be called upon at any moment for the thousand dollars he had offered. How he was to raise that amount he had not the slightest idea, and he realized that he had made a fool of himself. If he failed to make good, he would be the laughing-stock of all, and he would be ashamed to be seen again on the streets of Glucom.
<br> 
<br> Added to this worry was the thought of Jess leaving home. He recalled what she had said that morning on the way from the station, as well as her recent conversation at the dinner table. That she was determined to go in a few weeks seemed certain, and Abner groaned inwardly when he thought of the dreariness of the house without her exhilarating presence.
<br> 
<br> "Hang that Seminary!" he muttered. "I wish to goodness Jess had never seen the place. Social Service! Progress! Uplift! Umph! I wouldn't mind gals studyin' sich things if they'd use common sense. But to galivant off to elevate people in big cities instead of stayin' home where they kin be of some real use, is what makes me hot."
<br> 
<br> Abner had paused in his work and was leaning upon his hoe. He was gazing thoughtfully out over the field, toward the main highway. And, as he looked, a car containing one man came suddenly into sight, and drew up by the side of the road. Then a man alighted and walked briskly across the field.
<br> 
<br> "It's Ikey Dimock, skiddy-me-shins, if it ain't!" Abner exclaimed. "What in the world kin the critter want of me! I don't want to see him, nor anyone of his brood."
<br> 
<br> Isaac Dimock was a little man, but what he lacked in size he tried to make up in pompousness. "It seems to me," Abner once said, "that the Lord got somehow mixed up when he was makin' Ikey Dimock. It is sartin' sure, judgin' from Ikey's ears and brains, that he intended him to be a jackass. But He must have changed his mind, an' finished him up as a man, but a mighty poor job He made of it. It's quite clear that Ikey stopped growin' too soon. The only pity is that he ever grew at all."
<br> 
<br> Between these two men there had never been any love lost. Abner despised Isaac for his meanness, underhandedness, and pompousness, while Isaac hated Abner for his sharp tongue and biting sarcasm. They seldom met without a wordy battle of one kind or another. They never came to blows, as the hardware merchant had considerable respect for the farmer's great strength and big fists, one of which, on a certain memorable occasion, had been doubled up dangerously near his stub of a nose.
<br> 
<br> But Isaac seemed to have forgotten and forgiven all animosities as he now drew near. His face was contorted with a smile, such as a wolf might assume when about to pounce upon a lamb.
<br> 
<br> "How are you, Abner?" he accosted. "Fine day this."
<br> 
<br> "Why, so it is," and Abner gazed around in apparent astonishment, "I hadn't thought about it before. It's good of ye to come an' tell me."
<br> 
<br> "You work too hard," the visitor replied, unheeding the sarcasm. "You don't take time to notice the beautiful things around you."
<br> 
<br> "H'm," Abner grunted. "It takes all my spare minutes tryin' to wring a livin' out of this darn place. Have to keep me nose to the ground most of the time."
<br> 
<br> "I should say so," and Isaac cast his eyes around until they rested upon the big gravel hill to his right. "Pretty light ground, eh?"
<br> 
<br> "Light! Should say it is. Why, it's so light I have to keep the place anchored or it 'ud go up like a balloon."
<br> 
<br> "Ha, ha, it certainly must be light. Rather dangerous, isn't it?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, I'm not the least bit afraid of what old Mother Nature does. She's pretty reliable, an' doesn't do any kinky tricks. Ye kin ginerally depend upon her. But it's human nature on two legs that I'm suspicious of."
<br> 
<br> Isaac cast a swift glance at the farmer in an effort to interpret the meaning of his words. But Abner's face was perfectly placid as he leaned upon his hoe and surveyed his garden.
<br> 
<br> "Why are you suspicious of human nature?" Isaac enquired.
<br> 
<br> "'Cause it's allus tryin' to undermine one, that's why. Now look here, I work this place, plant seeds, fight frost, bugs, cutworms, crows, an' dear knows what all. Then I take me produce to town, an' give it away. Yes, actually give it away, fer I don't make enough profit to keep a shirt on a flea. But when them storekeepers sell the stuff which caused me so much work an' anxiety they make big profits. They call it bizness; but I call it robbery. Is it any wonder that I'm suspicious of human nature on two legs?"
<br> 
<br> "It certainly is discouraging," Isaac blandly purred. He was thinking of his own big profits in hardware. "It is a wonder you don't give up farming," he continued. "Why not try something else?"
<br> 
<br> "I'm goin' to give it up," Abner declared.
<br> 
<br> "You are! Well, it's fortunate that I came to see you to-day."
<br> 
<br> "Why?"
<br> 
<br> "Because I want to buy your place."
<br> 
<br> "Buy my place!" Abner exclaimed. "What de ya want this place fer, I'd like to know?"
<br> 
<br> "For the situation. I need a place where I can bring my family during the summer, and this farm will suit us fine. The view is excellent, and there is a good beach for boating and bathing. How much do you want for it?"
<br> 
<br> "I didn't say I was goin' to sell, did I?" Abner roared.
<br> 
<br> "But you just told me you are going to give up farming, didn't you?"
<br> 
<br> "Sure, I did. But that doesn't mean I want to sell. I'm goin' to give up farmin' some day, an' you're goin' to give up the hardware bizness, too. But I shall keep the place fer the sake of the situation. I'll want it a few hundred years from now, fer I don't expect to light upon a nicer spot."
<br> 
<br> Isaac's eyes opened wide with amazement. He gave a slight start and looked keenly at Abner.
<br> 
<br> "Did you say 'a few hundred years?'" he asked.
<br> 
<br> "That's jist what I said. But it may be more, fer I can't tell how long it will take me to develop."
<br> 
<br> "Develop!"
<br> 
<br> "Sure. Ye see, I've been so long reachin' the Abner Andrews stage that I can't jist tell when I'll arrive."
<br> 
<br> "Arrive! Arrive where?"
<br> 
<br> "At the angel stage where I kin live without eatin' an' workin'. It's necessary fer a man to be sich a bein' to live on a place like this. That's what old Parson Shaw said after he'd been at Plunkerville fer several years."
<br> 
<br> "So you expect to be an angel, do you?" Isaac queried, while his mouth expanded into a grin.
<br> 
<br> "I'm hopin' that way, providin' I don't git any set-back, which would delay me fer a few hundred years or so."
<br> 
<br> "Won't it be rather lonesome living here all by yourself?" Isaac bantered. "How will you occupy your time?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, I'm not worrin' about that. I'll have plenty to do."'
<br> 
<br> "You will! Along what line?"
<br> 
<br> "Lookin' after poultry; 'specially geese."
<br> 
<br> "Geese!"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, that's what I'll be doin' judgin' from present indications. Guess most of the folks in Glucom will have reached the goose stage by that time, if I'm not much mistaken. Most likely you'll be there, too, Ikey, though your pin-feathers won't be very tender. You'll surely be an old goose by that time."
<br> 
<br> This was more than Isaac could stand. His face reddened, and his bland smile departed.
<br> 
<br> "What do you mean by insulting me?" he demanded. "You owe me an apology for those words."
<br> 
<br> "Ye'r mistaken there, Ikey. It's the geese I should apologize to. I didn't mean to insult them poor critters."
<br> 
<br> "You're no gentleman," Isaac shouted, now fully aroused. "You're nothing but an ignorant clown."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, I reckon I am. But I'll improve by the time I'm ready to keep geese. Ye'll hardly know me then. But I'll know you, Ikey, fer no one could ever mistake that nose, even when it's changed into a goose's bill. There'll be lots of grubs and worms fer ye to feed on by the looks of things now."
<br> 
<br> "You impudent cur!" Isaac roared. "I didn't come here to be insulted, but to have a quiet talk about buying your place."
<br> 
<br> "No one asked ye to come, Ikey Dimock, an' the sooner ye go the better. Ye've insulted me over an' over agin, an' thought it was all right. But two kin play at that game, an' by the jumpin'-frog I've a good mind to twist ye'r measley neck."
<br> 
<br> So fierce did Abner look that Isaac retreated a few steps.
<br> 
<br> "Oh, don't git scared," Abner laughed. "I'll not hurt ye. But next time ye come to buy this place, bring ye'r shot-gun along. I don't like to kill a man without givin' him a chance to defend himself."
<br> 
<br> "I'll bring a constable, that's who I'll bring."
<br> 
<br> "All right, bring the hull police force if ye want to. They kin set as long as they like by the side of the road an' watch me hoe. That's as fer as they'll git, fer I'm king on me own ground, an' so long as I mind me own bizness I defy anyone to meddle with me. You're a trespasser here to-day, Ikey Dimock, an' the sooner ye hit fer the road the better fer all consarned."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, I'm going, Abner Andrews," Isaac angrily replied. "You have insulted me to-day, and have made a great bluster, but you'll come down with a flop when you're called upon to pay that thousand dollars you subscribed for the Orphans' Home."
<br> 
<br> "Hey, what's that ye'r gittin' off?" Abner demanded. "What bizness is it of yours, I'd like to know? Why should I flop when I'm asked to pay?"
<br> 
<br> "Simply because you haven't got it; that's why."
<br> 
<br> "What'll ye bet?"
<br> 
<br> "I won't bet."
<br> 
<br> "No, because ye'r scared. Ye know ye'd lose."
<br> 
<br> "What's the sense of talking that way, Abner? I know that you were only bluffing when you offered that thousand dollars, and you can't deny it. How could you ever make that much on a place like this?"
<br> 
<br> "By workin' the skin-game, that's how."
<br> 
<br> "The skin-game! What is that?"
<br> 
<br> "Don't ye know, Ikey? Now, I skin the ground fer what I git, an' mighty thin skinnin' it is. But you skin human bein's, 'specially poor widders."
<br> 
<br> Dimock waited to hear no more, but, turning angrily away, hastened across the field, boarded his car and drove furiously off. Abner watched him until he disappeared around the bend.
<br> 
<br> "Wasn't he mad, though?" he chuckled. "He got a flea in the ear that time, all right, ho, ho! It's not fer the situation or fer the sake of his health he wants this place, that's quite sartin. Dimock's not that kind. There's somethin' more'n ordinary back of this, an' it's up to me to find out what it is."
