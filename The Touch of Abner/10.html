<br> 
<br> It was a hot afternoon, and Zebedee Burns found the shade of the big maple near his workshop very refreshing. He was sitting with his back against the trunk of the tree, his eyes riveted upon the front page of The Live Wire, which the mailman had just left. So intent was he upon what he was reading that he did not notice a man walking toward him from the road. It was Abner, who, when a few yards away, stopped and stood for a few seconds studying his neighbor.
<br> 
<br> "Some people kin take life easy," Abner presently remarked. "Comes nat'ral, I guess."
<br> 
<br> Zebedee merely glanced at his visitor, and without a word continued his reading.
<br> 
<br> "What's the news, Zeb?" Abner asked, coming close and squatting down upon the grass. "Must be mighty interestin' by the way ye keep ye'r eyes glued upon that page."
<br> 
<br> Zebedee lowered the paper and looked quizzically at his companion.
<br> 
<br> "Say, Abner," he began, "what were ye doin' yesterday?"
<br> 
<br> "What was I doin' yesterday! What de ye mean? Wasn't I Abner Andrews?"
<br> 
<br> "Ye couldn't have been accordin' to this mornin's paper. Ye must have been one o' them ancients ye've told me about so often, an' a mighty savage one at that."
<br> 
<br> "Hey, what are ye givin' me? What's that dirty sheet sayin' about decent people now?"
<br> 
<br> "Isn't it true?"
<br> 
<br> "What true?"
<br> 
<br> "That you acted like a fool or a lunatic in town yesterday; waylaid a girl drivin' along Main street; that she beat you black an' blue with her whip, an' then had you arrested?"
<br> 
<br> Abner was on his feet in an instant, greatly excited.
<br> 
<br> "Is that what it says?" he roared.
<br> 
<br> "Sure, haven't I jist told ye?"
<br> 
<br> "But doesn't it explain anythin'? Doesn't it tell who the gal was, an' why I did what I did?"
<br> 
<br> "Here, read it fer ye'rself," and Zeb handed him the paper.
<br> 
<br> Slowly and carefully Abner read the article which occupied a prominent position, and was featured in big headlines. The writer had made the most of the incident, and the fact that the girl was the daughter of the Attorney General added all the more to the interest. The story was distorted beyond all semblance of reality and mingled with humor. It ended by saying that the culprit was allowed to go owing to the girl, who interceded on his behalf.
<br> 
<br> Abner's body trembled from the vehemence of his anger, and when he had finished reading he thrust the paper under Zebedee's nose.
<br> 
<br> "De ye believe that?" he demanded.
<br> 
<br> "Ain't it true?" Zeb asked.
<br> 
<br> "True! True! Did ye ever see anythin' true in that rag? It's a lie, a d—n lie, an' I'm goin' to punch the nose of that feller wot wrote it, see if I don't."
<br> 
<br> "Ye better be careful," Zeb warned. "Ye might have to punch several noses, the editor's included."
<br> 
<br> "An' de ye think I can't do it? I kin wipe up the hull bunch with one hand. I'll make 'em take backwater, an' apologize right smart. Why can't they leave decent honest people alone? They've got more ink than brains. If they'd spend some of their energy writin' about Hen Whittles' vile dump, an' how he wants to sell the place fer one thousand dollars fer that Orphan Home, it 'ud be more sensible."
<br> 
<br> "Are they thinkin' of puttin' the Home on that dump?" Zeb asked in surprise.
<br> 
<br> "That's jist it. An' they want my money to buy the hole, which is a dam sight worse than that old Toefat of the Bible."
<br> 
<br> "Did they ask you fer the money?"
<br> 
<br> "Sure. Lawyer Rackshaw is doin' the bizness, an' when he asked me yesterday fer the money, I burnt the end of his nose with the cigar I was smokin'. It was too bad to spoil a good cigar on a thing like that."
<br> 
<br> "An' what did he do?"
<br> 
<br> "Nuthin' 'cept tumble backwards on the floor, chair an' all. He got the jolt of his life that time, all right."
<br> 
<br> "Ye better be careful," Zeb advised. "Lawyer Rackshaw's not likely to fergit a thing like that, an' I've heard say that he never fergives."
<br> 
<br> "I hope he won't fergit his burnt nose, an' I don't care a blue divil if he doesn't fergive."
<br> 
<br> "You must like to be in hot water, Abner."
<br> 
<br> "I don't mind at all, 'specially when others are in with me. I've got a pretty tough skin, an' kin stand more'n most people."
<br> 
<br> "Guess ye'r right, Abner," Zeb agreed, as he rose to his feet. "I must git to work now."
<br> 
<br> Abner went back to his haying, and worked with feverish energy. He was more irritated than usual over the article which had appeared in The Live Wire, and he vowed that the editor should apologize for the insult.
<br> 
<br> "Mebbe they'll find that they can't take liberties with Abner Andrews," he muttered, "even though he doesn't wear biled shirts an' white collars."
<br> 
<br> When he had worked for about half an hour he went into the house for a drink of buttermilk. As he came out of the milk-room he heard a knock upon the front door.
<br> 
<br> "Who in time kin that be, now?" he growled, as he shuffled through the dining-room and into the hall-way. Glancing through the small window, he saw an auto in front of the house, with a young man at the wheel.
<br> 
<br> The door was locked and when Abner tried to turn the key it stuck.
<br> 
<br> "Hang the thing," he growled. "What's the matter with it, anyway?"
<br> 
<br> After several minutes of desperate efforts, punctured by numerous ejaculations of disgust and anger, the key turned, the lock moved, and Abner pulled the door open with a savage yank. Great was his surprise to see standing before him a smartly dressed woman, smiling in a most pleasant manner.
<br> 
<br> "Excuse me," she began. "I am sorry to give you so much trouble. But does Mr. Andrews live here?"
<br> 
<br> "Naw, he jist sleeps here, an' lives out of doors."
<br> 
<br> "But it's your place, isn't it?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, I s'pose so, when Tildy's not around."
<br> 
<br> "I have come to see Miss Rivers," the woman explained. "She's staying with you, is she not?"
<br> 
<br> "Yep, she's here all right, but jist now she's out pickin' berries with Tildy an' Jess. So ye want to see her, eh?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, if it's not too much trouble."
<br> 
<br> "'Tain't no trouble fer me, though it might be fer Belle. Come in an' set down while I toot the horn."
<br> 
<br> Throwing open a door to the left, Abner ushered the visitor into the parlor.
<br> 
<br> "Set right down, an' make ye'rself at home," he told her.
<br> 
<br> The woman smiled to herself as Abner left her. Then she studied the room most critically, from the old-fashioned piano to the fresh flowers in the vase upon the center-table.
<br> 
<br> "Strange that the Attorney General's daughter should be visiting here," she mused. "What an ignorant and uncouth man that farmer is. His language was most profane when he was trying to open the door."
<br> 
<br> Presently the long-drawn blast of the tin horn sounded upon her ears, and again she smiled, but it was the smile of contempt.
<br> 
<br> "How primitive," she meditated. "And to think of Miss Rivers picking berries like an ordinary country girl! I wonder if her father knows where she is, and what she is doing. I believe the Andrewses have a daughter. I suppose I must invite her, too."
<br> 
<br> In a few minutes Abner returned, sat down upon a chair near the piano, and crossed his legs.
<br> 
<br> "There, I guess that'll bring her," he remarked. "Tildy'll think the house is on fire. She's most scared to death of fire, Tildy is."
<br> 
<br> "You have a beautiful place here," and the woman glanced out of the window on her left as she spoke.
<br> 
<br> "'Tain't too bad, considerin' everythin'."
<br> 
<br> "And the view is magnificent, Mr. Andrews."
<br> 
<br> "So Ikey Dimock told me t'other day."
<br> 
<br> "Was Mr. Dimock here?"
<br> 
<br> "Yep. He called to see me when I was hoein' pertaters."
<br> 
<br> "He did! And what did he want?" The woman seemed unusually curious, and this Abner noted.
<br> 
<br> "He wanted to buy my place," he explained.
<br> 
<br> "Buy your place!"
<br> 
<br> "Yep. Wanted it as a summer place fer his family, so he said."
<br> 
<br> "Did you come to any agreement?"
<br> 
<br> "Should say not. I ain't anxious to sell, 'specially to Ikey Dimock."
<br> 
<br> "Why?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, me an' him don't jibe; never did."
<br> 
<br> "You have known him for some time, then?"
<br> 
<br> "Should say I have. Why, I knew Ikey Dimock when he was pickin' pin-feathers off his mother's chickens when she was gittin' 'em ready fer market."
<br> 
<br> At these words the bland expression suddenly left the woman's face, and she straightened herself up haughtily in her chair.
<br> 
<br> "Mr. Dimock is of good family, so I understand," she challenged.
<br> 
<br> "'Deed he is," was Abner's unexpected agreement. "I knew Ikey's dad well, an' he was the best man I ever saw at steerin' clear of a job. Why, when he was with me on my old Flyin' Scud he spent most of his time plannin' how to git clear of his work. He surely was great at that."
<br> 
<br> "But he was honest, at any rate, was he not?" the woman asked, now visibly annoyed.
<br> 
<br> "Honest? He was the honestest man I ever sot eyes on. Why, he was so honest that he was allus tryin' to take care of his neighbors' property. Everythin' he could git his hands on he would take home. He was so honest that at last his neighbors allus kept their barns an' stables locked."
<br> 
<br> "Do you mean to tell me that he was a thief?" the woman demanded. "You seem to have a very poor opinion of him."
<br> 
<br> "Yaas, almost as poor an opinion as old Judge Watkins, who sentenced him to six months in jail fer stealin' oats from Bill Armstrong's barn. Ye kin call that anythin' ye like, but the Judge called it stealin', an' he ginerally knew what he was talkin' about."
<br> 
<br> The woman was evidently much annoyed at this candid portrayal of the elder Dimock. She glanced toward the door as if meditating a speedy departure. Abner noted this, and it amused him.
<br> 
<br> "I wonder what in time's keepin' Tildy," he remarked. "She ginerally comes home like a steam engine, pantin' an' puffin', when I blow the horn at this time of the day. I wish to goodness she'd come, fer I was never any good at entertainin' company, 'specially women."
<br> 
<br> "You have certainly entertained me in a most unexpected, and, I might add, unpleasant, manner," the woman retorted. "I am not fond of having past histories raked up. It isn't pleasant."
<br> 
<br> "I reckon it ain't, 'specially sich a one as that of the Dimock family."
<br> 
<br> "But surely you should not blame Mr. Isaac Dimock for what his father did. He, at any rate, is above reproach, and you can't bring any unworthy charge against him."
<br> 
<br> "That's true," Abner assented. "It 'ud be no use bringin' any charge aginst Ikey so long as he's hand an' glove with the Government. It 'ud only be workin' fer nuthin'. Ye couldn't ketch him, not by a jugful."
<br> 
<br> "Why, what has the Government to do with Mr. Dimock?" the woman asked in apparent surprise.
<br> 
<br> "It has a great deal to do with him, an' almost any fool could tell ye that. The Government has made Ikey Dimock jist what he is, if ye want to know the plain truth."
<br> 
<br> "It has! In what way?"
<br> 
<br> "H'm," and Abner shifted significantly. "Hasn't the Government been feedin' him with pap fer years now? Supplyin' him with big contracts fer hardware, an' givin' him great rake-offs in all sorts of government work? That's the way Ikey Dimock made his money, an' he's nuthin' more'n a chip off the old block. They called it stealin' when his dad took the oats from Bill Armstrong's barn, but now they call it 'high finance,' or some sich name. But it's stealin' jist the same. I could tell ye a few things if I had a mind to."
<br> 
<br> The woman, however, could stand no more. She had risen to her feet, her face pale, and her eyes blazing with anger.
<br> 
<br> "Do you know who I am?" she witheringly asked.
<br> 
<br> "Don't ye know ye'rself? If ye don't, how de ye expect me to?"
<br> 
<br> "I am Mrs. Isaac Dimock, that's who I am, and I shall tell my husband what you have been saying about him and his father."
<br> 
<br> "That won't be any news to Ikey; better tell him somethin' new. He knows that already."
<br> 
<br> "Why, I never had anyone talk to me in such an insolent way before," the woman protested. "I didn't come here to be insulted."
<br> 
<br> "Is tellin' the truth insultin' ye?" Abner asked, as he, too, rose to his feet. "If the truth of many things was known it 'ud be better fer all consarned. But, there, I hear the women now. I guess ye've had enough of me."
<br> 
<br> Abner slipped out of the house as speedily as possible, after telling his wife that a visitor was in the parlor. He sat down upon the wood-pile, and meditated over what had just taken place.
<br> 
<br> "Ho! ho!" he chuckled. "Her ladyship got a jolt to-day, all right. She thought I didn't know her, eh? I knew her the minute I sot eyes on her. She didn't like what I said about the Dimocks. But I could have told her somethin', too, about her own family-tree. My, wasn't she mad! Ho, ho!"
