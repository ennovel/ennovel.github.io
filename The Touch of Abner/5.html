<br> 
<br> The morning sun struggled through the dust-covered window, and fell aslant the pine board which Zebedee Burns was carefully planing. It was a small workroom, littered with boards, tools, and shavings. Adjoining was the blacksmith shop, for Zebedee was a handy man, and combined carpentering with the smith-trade, besides tending his garden. He was seldom rushed with business, and found time to do extra work, such as trading in "Society" pigs.
<br> 
<br> He had just finished planing the board, and was measuring it with his two-foot rule when a form darkened the doorway.
<br> 
<br> "Mornin', Zeb," was the cheery greeting.
<br> 
<br> "Mornin', Abner," was the laconic reply.
<br> 
<br> "Busy, I see. Makin' a cage fer ye'r society pig, I s'pose," Abner bantered, as he sat down upon the tool-chest.
<br> 
<br> Zebedee deigned no reply, but went on with his work. He sawed a few inches off the planed board, laid it carefully aside and picked up another. Abner was surprised at his unusual manner, and studied his face most intently.
<br> 
<br> "What's wrong, Zeb?" he at length enquired. "Ye look as if ye'd been to a funeral. Haven't lost one of the Chosen Tribes, have ye?"
<br> 
<br> "Quit ye'r foolin', Abner," was the chiding reply. "I haven't been to any funeral, though I expect to be at one to-morrow."
<br> 
<br> "Ye do!" and Abner's eyes grew suddenly big. "Who's dead?"
<br> 
<br> "Widder Denton's little boy."
<br> 
<br> "Whew! Ye don't tell! Never heard a word about it. When did he die?"
<br> 
<br> "Yesterday. I'm makin' his coffin now."
<br> 
<br> "Ye are, eh? Somewhat out of ye'r line, isn't it? I thought the undertaker in town allus attended to sich affairs."
<br> 
<br> "He does if there's any money in it. But this is a different case. Widder Denton's too poor to buy a casket, so that's why I've tackled the job. Guess there'll be more to make fer the same family belong long, if I'm not mistaken."
<br> 
<br> "What! Diphtheria?"
<br> 
<br> "No; starvation."
<br> 
<br> "Holy smoke! Ye don't say so! Didn't know it's as bad as that."
<br> 
<br> "Well, it is. That poor widder has been workin' so hard to keep her family that she's gone under. I wouldn't be surprised if it's her coffin I'll have to make next."
<br> 
<br> "Ye don't tell! Why, I thought she got money from the company when her husband was killed."
<br> 
<br> "H'm, Lawyer Rackshaw got most of it, accordin' to what she told me only yesterday."
<br> 
<br> "He did! The skunk! An' him smokin' half a dozen ten-cent cigars every day. It's a wonder she never squealed on him."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, that's jist like her. She wouldn't have told me yesterday if I hadn't pumped it out of her. She's a game one, all right. But I do pity the poor little kids. I don't know what's to become of them."
<br> 
<br> "How many are there?"
<br> 
<br> "Five, I guess. The little chap who died was the youngest, an' he was only three."
<br> 
<br> "My, my!" Abner sighed, while an expression of sincere sympathy came into his eyes. "What de ye s'pose kin be done fer 'em?"
<br> 
<br> "Don't know, unless we kin git them into that Orphan Home."
<br> 
<br> "What Home?" Abner asked in surprise.
<br> 
<br> "Why, you ought to know," and Zeb looked up from his work. "You gave a thousand dollars to it, didn't ye?"
<br> 
<br> "A thousand be hanged! I didn't give a red cent."
<br> 
<br> "So I thought. Jist hold these boards together, will ye?"
<br> 
<br> Abner at once obeyed, and after Zeb had driven in two nails, he straightened himself up, and looked at his companion.
<br> 
<br> "You never intended to give a thousand to that Home, did ye?" he asked.
<br> 
<br> "Sure. What de ye think I am? A fool?"
<br> 
<br> "Not altogether, but next door to one, I should say."
<br> 
<br> "Ye've got a darn lot of gall," Abner retorted. "Ye must have inherited it from one of the Lost Tribes, didn't ye?"
<br> 
<br> "Never mind the Lost Tribes now, Abner. You know what I say is true. You're no more able to give a thousand dollars to that Home than I am to buy out the whole of Glucom. How in the world de ye expect to git out of the scrape, anyway? Ye'll be the laughin'-stock of everyone."
<br> 
<br> "Never you mind, Zeb, how I'll git out of it. I'll square up all right, so ye needn't bust any button off about it. I know a wrinkle or two."
<br> 
<br> "Ye'll have to git a hustle on, then, if them Denton kids are to be helped."
<br> 
<br> Abner took three or four steps across the room, and then stopped and looked out of the door. Presently he turned and watched Zebedee for a few seconds.
<br> 
<br> "How much de ye expect to git fer that job?" he suddenly asked.
<br> 
<br> "Jist as much as you'd expect, an' that's nuthin'," was the quick reply.
<br> 
<br> Abner's right hand was now in his trousers pocket, firmly gripping the ten dollar bill which had been given to him by the agent. Then he drew it forth, and flung it upon the work-bench.
<br> 
<br> "Take that, Zeb, an' give it to Widder Denton," he ordered. "It's been burnin' me pocket until me skin is scorched. There, don't ask me where I got it," he added, as Zeb started to speak. "I've got enough lies scratched down aginst me already. But I do feel like havin' a good fight."
<br> 
<br> "Fight! What de ye want to fight fer?" Zeb asked in astonishment.
<br> 
<br> "'Cause I'm ugly, that's why. The sight of that ten-spot makes me want to hit somebody."
<br> 
<br> "Well, ye'd better git out of this if that's the way ye feel. I've no inclination or time to fight to-day."
<br> 
<br> "An' ye don't want a scrap over the Ten Lost Tribes? I've given ye plenty of chances. Now, look, Zeb, who was the great-great-great-grandfather of the man who lost the Ten Tribes in the first place? Kin ye tell me that?"
<br> 
<br> Such a question in the past had always stirred Zebedee to his inmost depths. But now, instead of launching forth in defence of his pet theory, he leaned against the work-bench, folded his arms, and faced his visitor.
<br> 
<br> "Abner," he began, "I've been thinkin'."
<br> 
<br> "Well, that's encouragin'," was the reply. "A bit out of the ordinary, eh? I thought there was somethin' wrong with ye."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, I've been thinkin'," Zeb repeated, "an' if you'd do the same occasionally, Abner, it might do ye a world of good."
<br> 
<br> "H'm, ye needn't judge all ye'r neighbors' pigs by ye'r own," was the retort.
<br> 
<br> "I'm not, Abner. I'm only judgin' by solid facts. Now, see here. You an' me have been makin' fools of ourselves by always squabblin' over things of little real value. I yanged about the Lost Tribes, an' you yanged about how many lives you've lived."
<br> 
<br> "They're mighty interestin', though," Abner remarked.
<br> 
<br> "I know they are, an' there's no harm in discussin' them once in a while. But it don't seem altogether right fer two men like you an' me to spend so much time over sich things, an' pay little or no heed to what takes place right under our noses."
<br> 
<br> "Guess there's not much that escapes us, Zeb, is there?"
<br> 
<br> "What about that Denton family, then?"
<br> 
<br> "But we thought they was well fixed."
<br> 
<br> "Did we ever think much about them, anyway, Abner?"
<br> 
<br> "Guess ye'r right, Zeb. We didn't."
<br> 
<br> "We certainly didn't, an' that's what's worrin' me. Why, when I looked at that poor little dead boy last night, an' talked to the widder, an' saw the pinched faces of her children, I felt small enough to crawl through a knot-hole."
<br> 
<br> "Sure, ye did," Abner agreed. "I've felt that way meself, 'specially when Tildy was after me. It's a mighty creepy feelin', isn't it?"
<br> 
<br> "Indeed it is, an' more so when ye'r conscience is lashin' ye like a thousand divils. I had a hard time to git to sleep last night, fer the picture of the Great Judgment riz right up before me. I heard the Lord a-sayin', 'Zeb Burns, them Denton kids was hungry an' ye gave them nuthin' to eat; they was thirsty an' ye never gave them any fresh milk; they was almost naked an' ye didn't give them any clothes. If ye had done them things that little Denton boy wouldn't have died.' That's what I thought He said, an' when I went to sleep I dreamed that I was bein' sent to the left hand right into hell fire. It gave me sich a scare that I jumped out of bed with a yell, an' my wife thought I was crazy. I tell ye it was an awful experience."
<br> 
<br> Zebedee pulled out a big red handkerchief, and mopped his brow.
<br> 
<br> "My! I git all het up when I think of it," he panted.
<br> 
<br> Abner made no immediate reply, but stood very still with his eyes fixed intently upon the floor.
<br> 
<br> "Guess I'll go now," he at length announced.
<br> 
<br> "What are ye workin' at these days?" Zeb asked.
<br> 
<br> "Pertaters; an' a mighty pesky job it is. Full of weeds."
<br> 
<br> "Why, I thought ye had them all done."
<br> 
<br> "So I would if it hadn't been fer house-cleanin'."
<br> 
<br> "House-cleanin'!"
<br> 
<br> "Sure. House so spick an' span that I kin hardly step or set anywheres, so I generally roost on the wood-box. Well, s'long. I must be off."
