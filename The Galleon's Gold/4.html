Sometimes one had the better of it, and sometimes the other.
<br> 
<br> 15Pomp saw what he believed an elegant opportunity to square some past grievances with his friend.
<br> 
<br> “Golly, I done fix dat chile!” he chuckled. “He laike whisky, do he? Massy Lordy, I gib him de Keeley Cure!”
<br> 
<br> With which, still chuckling, he reached up and took down a small bag of ground red dust and seeds, and which was marked “Ground Red Peppers.”
<br> 
<br> “Golly!” chuckled the darky, “he done fink somefin’ got him fo’ suah!”
<br> 
<br> Into the flask he put a liberal quantity of the ground peppers. Then he touched his tongue to the compound.
<br> 
<br> The touch fairly lifted him off his feet. A swallow would seem sufficient to send a man up in smoke, so hot was it.
<br> 
<br> So delighted was the darky with the prospect that he yielded to immediate laughter.
<br> 
<br> Barney heard it and cried:
<br> 
<br> “Phwat the divil ails yez, naygur? Phwat do yez foind so funny?”
<br> 
<br> Pomp sobered at once.
<br> 
<br> “I was jes’ larfin’ to mahse’f,” he replied hastily, fearful that he would be suspected.
<br> 
<br> “Laughin’ at yesilf! Well, shure that’s nothin’ to be wondhered at. But shure will yez hurry up wid the crather?”
<br> 
<br> “Yo’ hold yo’ patience jes’ a bit till I put dis bread in de oven!” replied Pomp, “I’se comin’.”
<br> 
<br> Then he picked up the flask and sprang up the stairs. Barney took it from his hand eagerly.
<br> 
<br> “Begorra, it’s a gintlemon yez are!” cried Barney, “yez know well enuff phwat I need.”
<br> 
<br> With which the Celt threw the flask to his lips.
<br> 
<br> Pomp stood eagerly waiting for the explosion. Gurgle, gurgle went the liquor down his throat.
<br> 
<br> The darky stared.
<br> 
<br> Could he believe his senses?
<br> 
<br> The Celt slowly and deliberately drained the flask. Then he laid it down and said:
<br> 
<br> “Bejabers, that tastes loike some whisky I once got in Donnybrook!” he said. “It’s fairly aloive!”
<br> 
<br> Pomp gave a gasp.
<br> 
<br> Then he picked up the flask and looked at Barney like one in a dream. His eyes fairly rolled in their sockets.
<br> 
<br> Barney looked at him in surprise.
<br> 
<br> “Phwat the divil ails yez!” he cried. “Shure are yez sick?”
<br> 
<br> “N—no, sah!” replied the dazed coon, “but—did yo’ drink all dat whisky roight down an’——”
<br> 
<br> “Phwat the divil did yez expict me to do? Did yez want a sip yersilf?”
<br> 
<br> “N—no, sah!” spluttered the coon, “but—but——”
<br> 
<br> 16He said no more, but made his way down the stairs slowly to the galley. There he scratched his woolly pate and muttered:
<br> 
<br> “On mah wo’d I neber heerd ob sich a mouf an’ stummick as dat I’ishman hab got. I done fink he make a good meal on window glass any time he feel laike it.”
<br> 
<br> But Barney had tasted the most fiery of liquors too many times to mind a little thing like this. He knew from the taste that the darky had doctored the liquor, and he suspected what it was.
<br> 
<br> So he chuckled to himself.
<br> 
<br> “Begorra, the coon thought he had me solid that toime. But fer a fact he got badly left, fer divil a bit do I moind a little foire in the crather.”
<br> 
<br> But Barney laid it up against the darky just the same, and muttered:
<br> 
<br> “I’ll foix him fer it!”
<br> 
<br> While Pomp said:
<br> 
<br> “I done fink dat I’ishman am cast iron inside. I never fought he was sich a tough man afore.”
<br> 
<br> But for all that, the whisky did affect the Celt.
<br> 
<br> It was powerful strong and made Barney feel a bit tipsy. His hand was not so strong at the wheel.
<br> 
<br> As a result, an accident occurred. The boat was approaching a reef at full speed, when Barney’s foot slipped and he fell.
<br> 
<br> Before he could regain his feet the wheel spun around, there was a shock, and everybody was hurled to the cabin floor. The lights went out, there was a booming of waters and all was darkness.
<br> 
<br> The boat stood still. Frank Reade, Jr., was the first to recover himself.
<br> 
<br> He arose and groped his way into the pilot-house.
<br> 
<br> “Mither save us!” came a voice from the corner; “shure, it’s kilt I am intoirely!”
<br> 
<br> “Barney!” cried Frank, “what has happened?”
<br> 
<br> “Begorra, Misther Frank, divil a bit kin I tell yez. I think, though, that we have run ferninst a reef, sor!”
<br> 
<br> “Well, that’s pretty work!” cried Frank angrily. “What do you mean by such stupidity?”
<br> 
<br> “Shure, sor, I hope yez will not blame me too much. Me fut slipped an’ I fell.”
<br> 
<br> There was nothing to be done but make the best of it, though Frank gave the Celt a good reprimand.
<br> 
<br> Then he made haste to examine the exact position of the submarine boat and her chances.
<br> 
<br> It was an affair more than ordinarily serious. The reflection that they might be immovably fixed on the reef gave all the voyagers a chill.
<br> 
<br> 17The electric lights were quickly turned on, and the engines carefully inspected.
<br> 
<br> These fortunately were fond to be uninjured.
<br> 
<br> Frank reversed them, with a view to drawing the boat off the ledge if possible.
<br> 
<br> But this was useless. The boat was stuck there, and would not move. It was a serious case.
<br> 
<br> What was to be done?
<br> 
<br> They were many fathoms deep in the sea. Unless the boat could be freed from her position on the ledge, their fate would be too dreadful for contemplation.
<br> 
<br> Doomed to die of starvation at the bottom of the sea. It was a dreadful thought.
<br> 
<br> Clifford was very pale as he approached Frank and said:
<br> 
<br> “What are the chances, Mr. Reade?”
<br> 
<br> Frank shook his head slowly.
<br> 
<br> “Rather scant!” he said. “I can give no definite answer until after I have taken a look at her from the outside.”
<br> 
<br> “From the outside?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes.”
<br> 
<br> Clifford looked surprised.
<br> 
<br> “How can you do that?” he asked.
<br> 
<br> “Easy enough,” replied Frank. “I have a patent diving suit which I can wear.”
<br> 
<br> “Well, I am interested,” declared Clifford. “How will you dare to venture out in these waters in a diving suit? I should think the pressure would be too great.”
<br> 
<br> “Not with my new diving suit,” replied Frank. “I have perfected it so that, as no life line is used, a pressure of almost any depth can be resisted.”
<br> 
<br> “Without a life line? How do you breathe?”
<br> 
<br> “By means of a chemical generator which is portable and is carried on the back. It furnishes the best of air and is similar to the generator which furnishes our boat with oxygen.”
<br> 
<br> “Wonderful!” exclaimed Clifford. “You are truly a man of inventions, Mr. Reade.”
<br> 
<br> Frank laughed.
<br> 
<br> “That is the most simple of all my inventions,” he said.
<br> 
<br> “You don’t happen to have two of those wonderful diving suits, do you?”
<br> 
<br> “I have half a dozen.”
<br> 
<br> “Good! Would you mind my putting on one of them and accompanying you?”
<br> 
<br> “Certainly you may.”
<br> 
<br> Frank called to Barney, who brought out the diving suits. Two of them were selected.
<br> 
<br> Frank and Clifford were soon encased in the suits, and ready to leave the cabin.
<br> 
<br> 18Each carried a small ax at the girdle. Otherwise they were unarmed.
<br> 
<br> Of course there was something to fear from the monsters of the deep, but neither shrank from the risk. A moment later they entered the vestibule.
<br> 
<br> Then Frank closed the cabin door and pressed a valve. Instantly the vestibule filled with water.
<br> 
<br> It was an easy matter to open the outer door and walk out on the deck.
<br> 
<br> It required some moments for both to get accustomed to the unusual pressure. But after awhile they were enabled to see and think clearly.
<br> 
<br> Then Frank began to descend from the deck to the bed of the sea. He found solid footing in the sand which covered that part of the reef.
<br> 
<br> He made his way slowly along to the bow of the Dolphin.
<br> 
<br> A glance was enough.
<br> 
<br> The steel ram of the vessel was driven deep into the reef and seemed immovable. The keel rested in a cleft of coral which bound it tightly on all sides.
<br> 
<br> So intent was Frank upon examining the position of the Dolphin that he gave no thought to anything else about him.
<br> 
<br> So it happened that Clifford, who had been engaged in looking for coral specimens, came near getting into a bad scrape.
<br> 
<br> It happened in this way:
<br> 
<br> He had caught sight of a curious coral growth jutting out from the reef, and was determined to make an effort to secure it.
<br> 
<br> He clambered up a steep place and placed his hand upon the coral. At the same moment he noticed an orifice in the rock just to his right.
<br> 
<br> Even as he did so he fancied he saw the glitter of something bright beyond. But he gave it no heed.
<br> 
<br> This was Clifford’s mistake.
<br> 
<br> For while reaching for the coral a long, sinewy arm darted out of the orifice. In an instant it wound itself about the body of the unsuspecting diver.
<br> 
<br> It wound about him in serpentine fold and he was torn from his perch and drawn toward the orifice.
<br> 
<br> In one swift instant Clifford realized his peril and the character of his foe.
<br> 
<br> He knew that the sinewy arm was really the tentacle of a fierce octopus or sea-cat, and that its horrid jaws were waiting to mangle him.
<br> 
<br> And he seemed powerless to resist. For a moment he was dazed with utter horror and indecision.
<br> 
<br> What should he do?
<br> 
<br> This was a problem.
