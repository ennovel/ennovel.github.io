<p>　　Exhausted by fasting and emotion, he withdrew to his apartments and forseveral days denied himself to all but Heiligenstern, who was suspectedby some of suffering his patient's disorder to run its course with aview to proving the futility of such remedies. This break in hisintercourse with his kinsman left Odo free to take the measure of hisnew surroundings. The company most naturally engaging him was that whichsurrounded the Duchess; but he soon wearied of the trivial diversions itoffered. It had ever been necessary to him that his pleasures shouldtouch the imagination as well as the senses; and with such refinement ofenjoyment the gallants of Pianura were unacquainted. Odo indeedperceived with a touch of amusement that, in a society where DonSerafino set the pace, he must needs lag behind his own lacquey.</p> 
<p>　　Cantapresto had, in fact, been hailed by the Bishop's nephew with acordiality that proclaimed them old associates in folly; and thesoprano's manner seemed to declare that, if ever he had held the candlefor Don Serafino, he did not grudge the grease that might have droppedon his cassock. He was soon prime favourite and court buffoon in theDuchess's circle, organising pleasure-parties, composing scenarios forher Highness's private theatre, and producing at court any comedian orjuggler the report of whose ability reached him from the market-place.</p> 
<p>　　Indefatigable in the contriving of such diversions, he soon virtuallypassed out of Odo's service into that of her Highness: a circumstancewhich the young man the less regretted as it left him freer to cultivatethe acquaintance of Gamba and his friends without exposing them toCantapresto's espionage.</p> 
<p>　　Odo had felt himself specially drawn toward the abate Crescenti; and theafternoon after their first meeting he had repaired to the librarian'sdwelling. Crescenti was the priest of an ancient parish lying near thefortress; and his tiny house was wedged in an angle of the city walls,like a bird's nest in the mouth of a disused canon. A long flight ofsteps led up to his study, which on the farther side opened level with avine-shaded patch of herbs and damask roses in the projection of aruined bastion. This interior, the home of studious peace, was ascheerful and well-ordered as its inmate's mind; and Odo, seated underthe vine pergola in the late summer light, and tasting the abate's ValPulicella while he turned over the warped pages of old codes andchronicles, felt the stealing charm of a sequestered life.</p> 
<p>　　He had learned from Gamba that Crescenti was a faithful parish priest aswell as an assiduous scholar, but he saw that the librarian'sbeneficence took that purely personal form which may coexist with aserene acceptance of the general evils underlying particular hardships.</p> 
<p>　　His charities were performed in the old unquestioning spirit of theRoman distribution of corn; and doubtless the good man who carries hisloaf of bread and his word of hope into his neighbour's hovel reaps amore tangible return than the lonely thinker who schemes to underminethe strongholds of injustice. Still there was a perplexing contrastbetween the superficiality of Crescenti's moral judgments and thebreadth and penetration of his historic conceptions. Odo was tooinexperienced to reflect that a man's sense of the urgency ofimprovement lies mainly in the line of his talent: as the merchant ispersuaded that the roads most in need of mending are those on which hisbusiness makes him travel. Odo himself was already conscious of livingin a many-windowed house, with outlooks diverse enough to justify morethan one view of the universe; but he had no conception of thatconcentration of purpose that may make the mind's flight to its goal asdirect and unvarying as the course of a homing bird. The talk turning onGamba, Crescenti spoke of the help which the hunchback gave him in hiswork among the poor.</p> 
<p>　　"His early hardships," said he, "have given him an insight intocharacter that my happier circumstances have denied me; and he has morethan once been the means of reclaiming some wretch that I despaired of.</p> 
<p>　　Unhappily, his parts and learning are beyond his station, and will notlet him rest in the performance of his duties. His mind, I often tellhim, is like one of those inn parlours hung with elaborate maps of thethree Heretical Cities; whereas the only topography with which thevirtuous traveller need be acquainted is that of the Heavenly City towhich all our journeyings should tend. The soundness of his heartreassures me as to this distemper of the reason; but others are lessfamiliar with his good qualities and I tremble for the risks to whichhis rashness may expose him."The librarian went on to say that Gamba had a pretty poetical gift whichhe was suspected of employing in the composition of anonymous satires onthe court, the government and the Church. At that period every Italiantown was as full of lampoons as a marsh of mosquitoes, and it was asdifficult in the one case as the other for the sufferer to detect thespecific cause of his sting. The moment in Italy was a strange one. Thetide of reform had been turned back by the very act devised to hastenit: the suppression of the Society of Jesus. The shout of liberationthat rose over the downfall of the order had sunk to a guarded whisper.</p> 
<p>　　The dark legend already forming around Ganganelli's death, the hint ofthat secret liquor distilled for the order's use in a certain convent ofPerugia, hung like a menace on the political horizon; and the disbandedSociety seemed to have tightened its hold on the public conscience as adying man's clutch closes on his victorious enemy.</p> 
<p>　　So profoundly had the Jesuits impressed the world with the sense oftheir mysterious power that they were felt to be like one of thoseanimal organisms which, when torn apart, carry on a separate existencein every fragment. Ganganelli's bull had provided against their exertingany political influence, or controlling opinion as confessors or aspublic educators; but they were known to be everywhere in Italy, eitherhidden in other orders, or acting as lay agents of foreign powers, astutors in private families, or simply as secular priests. Even theconfiscation of their wealth did not seem to diminish the popular senseof their strength. Perhaps because that strength had never beencompletely explained, even by their immense temporal advantages, it wasfelt to be latent in themselves, and somehow capable of withstandingevery kind of external assault. They had moreover benefited by thereaction which always follows on the breaking up of any greatorganisation. Their detractors were already beginning to forget theirfaults and remember their merits. The people had been taught to hate theSociety as the possessor of wealth and privileges which should have beentheirs; but when the Society fell its possessions were absorbed by theother powers, and in many cases the people suffered from abuses andmaladministration which they had not known under their Jesuit landlords.</p> 
<p>　　The aristocracy had always been in sympathy with the order, and in manystates the Jesuits had been banished simply as a measure of politicalexpediency, a sop to the restless masses. In these cases the latentpower of the order was concealed rather than diminished by the pretenceof a more liberal government, and everywhere, in one form or another,the unseen influence was felt to be on the watch for those who dared totriumph over it too soon.</p> 
<p>　　Such conditions fostered the growth of social satire. Constructiveambition was forced back into its old disguises, and ridicule ofindividual weaknesses replaced the general attack on beliefs andinstitutions. Satirical poems in manuscript passed from hand to hand incoffee-houses, casinos and drawing-rooms, and every conspicuous incidentin social or political life was borne on a biting quatrain to theconfines of the state. The Duke's gift of Boscofolto to the CountessBelverde had stirred up a swarm of epigrams, and the most malignantamong them, Crescenti averred, were openly ascribed to Gamba.</p> 
<p>　　"A few more imprudences," he added, "must cost him his post; and if yourexcellency has any influence with him I would urge its being used torestrain him from such excesses."Odo, on taking his leave of the librarian, ran across Gamba at the firststreet-corner; and they had not proceeded a dozen yards together whenthe eye of the Duke's kinsman fell on a snatch of doggerel scrawled inchalk on an adjacent wall.</p> 
<p>　　"Beware (the quatrain ran) O virtuous wife or maid,Our ruler's fondness for the shade,Lest first he woo thee to the leafy gladeAnd then into the deeper wood persuade."This crude play on the Belverde's former title and the one she hadrecently acquired was signed "Carlo Gamba."Odo glanced curiously at the hunchback, who met the look with a composedsmile. "My enemies don't do me justice," said he; "I could do betterthan that if I tried;" and he effaced the words with a sweep of hisshabby sleeve.</p> 
<p>　　Other lampoons of the same quality were continually cropping up on thewalls of Pianura, and the ducal police were kept as busy rubbing themout as a band of weeders digging docks out of a garden. The Duchess'sdebts, the Duke's devotions, the Belverde's extortions, Heiligenstern'smummery, and the political rivalry between Trescorre and the Dominican,were sauce to the citizen's daily bread; but there was nothing in thesepopular satires to suggest the hunchback's trenchant irony.</p> 
<p>　　It was in the Bishop's palace that Odo read the first lampoon in whichhe recognised his friend's touch. In this society of polished dilettantisuch documents were valued rather for their literary merits than fortheir political significance; and the pungent lines in which the Duke'spanaceas were hit off (the Belverde figuring among them as a Lentendiet, a dinner of herbs, and a wonder-working bone) caused a flutter ofprofessional envy in the episcopal circle.</p> 
<p>　　The Bishop received company every evening; and Odo soon found that, asGamba had said, it was the best company in Pianura. His lordship livedin great state in the Gothic palace adjoining the Cathedral. The gloomyvaulted rooms of the original structure had been abandoned to the smallfry of the episcopal retinue. In the chambers around the courtyard hislordship drove a thriving trade in wines from his vineyards, while hisclients awaited his pleasure in the armoury, where the panoplies of hisfighting predecessors still rusted on the walls. Behind this facade alater prelate had built a vast wing overlooking a garden which descendedby easy terraces to the Piana. In the high-studded apartments of thiswing the Bishop held his court and lived the life of a wealthy secularnobleman. His days were agreeably divided between hunting, inspectinghis estates, receiving the visits of antiquarians, artists and literati,and superintending the embellishments of his gardens, then the mostfamous in North Italy; while his evenings were given to the more privatediversions which his age and looks still justified. In religiousceremonies or in formal intercourse with his clergy he was the mostimposing and sacerdotal of bishops; but in private life none knew betterhow to disguise his cloth. He was moreover a man of parts, and from theconstruction of a Latin hexameter to the growing of a Holland bulb, hada word worth hearing on all subjects likely to engage the dilettante. Aliking soon sprang up between Odo and this versatile prelate; and in theretirement of his lordship's cabinet, or pacing with him thegarden-alleys set with ancient marbles, the young man gathered manyprecepts of that philosophy of pleasure which the great churchmen of theeighteenth century practised with such rare completeness.</p> 
<p>　　The Bishop had not, indeed, given much thought to the problems whichmost deeply engaged his companion. His theory of life took no account ofthe future and concerned itself little with social conditions outsidehis own class; but he was acquainted with the classical schools ofthought, and, having once acted as the late Duke's envoy to the Frenchcourt, had frequented the Baron d'Holbach's drawing-room andfamiliarised himself with the views of the Encyclopaedists; though itwas clear that he valued their teachings chiefly as an argument againstasceticism.</p> 
<p>　　"Life," said he to Odo, as they sat one afternoon in a garden-pavilionabove the river, a marble Mercury confronting them at the end of a vistaof clipped myrtle, "life, cavaliere, is a stock on which we may graftwhat fruit or flower we choose. See the orange-tree in that Capo diMonte jar: in a week or two it will be covered with red roses. Hereagain is a citron set with carnations; and but yesterday my gardenersent me word that he had at last succeeded in flowering a pomegranatewith jasmine. In such cases the gardener chooses as his graft the flowerwhich, by its colour and fragrance, shall most agreeably contrast withthe original stock; and he who orders his life on the same principle,grafting it with pleasures that form a refreshing off-set to theobligations of his rank and calling, may regard himself as justified byNature, who, as you see, smiles on such abnormal unions among herchildren.--Not long ago," he went on, with a reminiscent smile, "I hadhere under my roof a young person who practised to perfection this artof engrafting life with the unexpected. Though she was only a player ina strolling company--a sweetheart of my wild nephew's, as you mayguess--I have met few of her sex whose conversation was so instructiveor who so completely justified the Scriptural adage, "the sweetness ofthe lips increaseth learning..." He broke off to sip his chocolate. "Butwhy," he continued, "do I talk thus to a young man whose path is linedwith such opportunities? The secret of happiness is to say with thegreat Emperor, 'Everything is fruit to me which thy seasons bring, ONature.'""Such a creed, monsignore," Odo ventured to return, "is as flattering tothe intelligence as to the senses; for surely it better becomes areasoning being to face fate as an equal than to cower before it like aslave; but, since you have opened yourself so freely on the subject, mayI carry your argument a point farther and ask how you reconcile yourconception of man's destiny with the authorised teachings of theChurch?"The Bishop raised his head with a guarded glance.</p> 
<p>　　"Cavaliere," said he, "the ancients did not admit the rabble to theirsacred mysteries; nor dare we permit the unlettered to enter thehollowed precincts of the temple of Reason.""True," Odo acquiesced; "but if the teachings of Christianity are thebest safeguard of the people, should not those teachings at least bestripped of the grotesque excrescences with which the superstitions ofthe people and--perhaps--the greed and craft of the priesthood havesmothered the simple precepts of Jesus?"The Bishop shrugged his shoulders. "As long," said he, "as the peopleneed the restraint of a dogmatic religion so long must we do our utmostto maintain its outward forms. In our market-place on feast-days thereappears the strange figure of a man who carries a banner painted with animage of Saint Paul surrounded by a mass of writhing serpents. This mancalls himself a descendant of the apostle and sells to our peasants themiraculous powder with which he killed the great serpent at Malta. If itwere not for the banner, the legend, the descent from Saint Paul, howmuch efficacy do you think those powders would have? And how long do youthink the precepts of an invisible divinity would restrain the evilpassions of an ignorant peasant? It is because he is afraid of theplaster God in his parish church, and of the priest who represents thatGod, that he still pays his tithes and forfeitures and keeps his handsfrom our throats. By Diana," cried the Bishop, taking snuff, "I have nopatience with those of my calling who go about whining for apostolicsimplicity, and would rob the churches of their ornaments and thefaithful of their ceremonies.</p> 
<p>　　"For my part," he added, glancing with a smile about thedelicately-stuccoed walls of the pavilion, through the windows of whichclimbing roses shed their petals on the rich mosaics transferred from aRoman bath, "for my part, when I remember that 'tis to Jesus of NazarethI owe the good roof over my head and the good nags in my stable; nay,the very venison and pheasants from my preserves, with the gold plate Ieat them off, and above all the leisure to enjoy as they deserve theseexcellent gifts of the Creator--when I consider this, I say, I standamazed at those who would rob so beneficent a deity of the least of hisprivileges.--But why," he continued again after a moment, as Odoremained silent, "should we vex ourselves with such questions, whenProvidence has given us so fair a world to enjoy and such variedfaculties with which to apprehend its beauties? I think you have notseen the Venus Callipyge in bronze that I have lately received fromRome?" And he rose and led the way to the house.</p> 
<p>　　This conversation revealed to Odo a third conception of the religiousidea. In Piedmont religion imposed itself as a military discipline, theenforced duty of the Christian citizen to the heavenly state; to theDuke it was a means of purchasing spiritual immunity from theconsequences of bodily weakness; to the Bishop, it replaced the panem etcircenses of ancient Rome. Where, in all this, was the share of thosewhom Christ had come to save? Where was Saint Francis's devotion to hisheavenly bride, the Lady Poverty? Though here and there a good parishpriest like Crescenti ministered to the temporal wants of the peasantry,it was only the free-thinker and the atheist who, at the risk of lifeand fortune, laboured for their moral liberation. Odo listened with asaddened heart, thinking, as he followed his host through the perfumedshade of the gardens, and down the long saloon at the end of which theVenus stood, of those who for the love of man had denied themselves suchdelicate emotions and gone forth cheerfully to exile or imprisonment.</p> 
<p>　　These were the true lovers of the Lady Poverty, the band in which helonged to be enrolled; yet how restrain a thrill of delight as theslender dusky goddess detached herself against the cool marble of herniche, looking, in the sun-rippled green penumbra of the saloon, with asound of water falling somewhere out of sight, as though she had juststepped dripping from the wave?</p> 
<p>　　In the Duchess's company life struck another gait. Here was no waitingon subtle pleasures, but a headlong gallop after the cruder sort.</p> 
<p>　　Hunting, gaming and masquerading filled her Highness's days; and Odo hadfelt small inclination to keep pace with the cavalcade, but for theflying huntress at its head. To the Duchess's "view halloo" every dropof blood in him responded; but a vigilant image kept his bosom barred.</p> 
<p>　　So they rode, danced, diced together, but like strangers who cross handsat a veglione. Once or twice he fancied the Duchess was for unmasking;but her impulses came and went like fireflies in the dusk, and it suitedhis humour to remain a looker-on.</p> 
<p>　　So life piped to him during his first days at Pianura: a merry tune inthe Bishop's company, a mad one in the Duchess's; but always with thesame sad undertone, like the cry of the wind on a warm threshold.</p>
