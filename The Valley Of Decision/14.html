This light, as Odo emerged, fell on aretreating figure which resembled that of the blind beggar he had seencrouching on the steps of the Corpus Domini. He ran forward, but the manhurried across the little square and disappeared in the darkness. Odohad not seen his face; but though his dress was tattered, and he leanedon a beggar's staff, something about his broad rolling back recalled thewell-filled outline of Cantapresto's cassock.</p> 
<p>　　Sick at heart, Odo rambled on from one street to another, avoiding themore crowded quarters, and losing himself more than once in thedistricts near the river, where young gentlemen of his figure seldomshowed themselves unattended. The populace, however, was all abroad, andhe passed as unregarded as though his sombre thoughts had enveloped himin actual darkness.</p> 
<p>　　It was late when at length he turned again into the Piazza Castello,which was brightly lit and still thronged with pleasure-seekers. As heapproached, the crowd divided to make way for three or four handsometravelling-carriages, preceded by linkmen and liveried out-riders andfollowed by a dozen mounted equerries. The people, evidently in thehumour to greet every incident of the streets as part of a show preparedfor their diversion, cheered lustily as the carriages dashed across thesquare; and Odo, turning to a man at his elbow, asked who thedistinguished visitors might be.</p> 
<p>　　"Why, sir," said the other laughing, "I understand it is only anEmbassage from some neighbouring state; but when our good people are intheir Easter mood they are ready to take a mail-coach for Elijah'schariot and their wives' scolding for the Gift of Tongues."Odo spent a restless night face to face with his first humiliation.</p> 
<p>　　Though the girl's rebuff had cut him to the quick, it was the vision ofthe havoc his folly had wrought that stood between him and sleep. Tohave endangered the liberty, the very life, perhaps, of a man he lovedand venerated, and who had welcomed him without heed of personal risk,this indeed was bitter to his youthful self-sufficiency. The thought ofGiannone's fate was like a cold clutch at his heart; nor was there anybalm in knowing that it was at Fulvia's request he had been so freelywelcomed; for he was persuaded that, whatever her previous feeling mighthave been, the scene just enacted must render him forever odious to her.</p> 
<p>　　Turn whither it would, his tossing vanity found no repose; and dawn rosefor him on a thorny waste of disillusionment.</p> 
<p>　　Cantapresto broke in early on this vigil, flushed with the importance ofa letter from the Countess Valdu. The lady summoned her son to dinner,"to meet an old friend and distinguished visitor"; and a verbal messagebade Odo come early and wear his new uniform. He was too well acquaintedwith his mother's exaggerations to attach much importance to thesummons; but being glad of an excuse to escape his daily visit at thePalazzo Tournanches, he sent Donna Laura word that he would wait on herat two.</p> 
<p>　　On the very threshold of Casa Valdu, Odo perceived that unwontedpreparations were afoot. The shabby liveries of the servants had beenrefurbished and the marble floor newly scoured; and he found his motherseated in the drawing-room, an apartment never unshrouded save on themost ceremonious occasions. As to Donna Laura, she had undergone thesame process of renovation, and with more striking results. It seemed toOdo, when she met him sparkling under her rouge and powder, as thoughsome withered flower had been dipped in water, regaining for the momenta languid semblance of its freshness. Her eyes shone, her hand trembledunder his lips, and the diamonds rose and fell on her eager bosom.</p> 
<p>　　"You are late!" she tenderly reproached him; and before he had time toreply, the double doors were thrown open, and the major-domo announcedin an awed voice: "His excellency Count Lelio Trescorre."Odo turned with a start. To his mind, already crowded with a confusionof thoughts, the name summoned a throng of memories. He saw again hismother's apartments at Pianura, and the handsome youth with lace rufflesand a clouded amber cane, who came and went among her other visitorswith an air of such superiority, and who rode beside thetravelling-carriage on the first stage of their journey to Donnaz. Tothat handsome youth the gentleman just announced bore the likeness ofthe finished portrait to the sketch. He was a man of abouttwo-and-thirty, of the middle height, with a delicate dark face and anair of arrogance not unbecomingly allied to an insinuating courtesy ofaddress. His dress of sombre velvet, with a star on the breast, and aprofusion of the finest lace, suggested the desire to add dignity andweight to his appearance without renouncing the softer ambitions of hisage.</p> 
<p>　　He received with a smile Donna Laura's agitated phrases of welcome. "Icome," said he kissing her hand, "in my private character, not as theEnvoy of Pianura, but as the friend and servant of the Countess Valdu;and I trust," he added turning to Odo, "of the Cavaliere Valsecca also."Odo bowed in silence.</p> 
<p>　　"You may have heard," Trescorre continued, addressing him in the sameengaging tone, "that I am come to Turin on a mission from his Highnessto the court of Savoy: a trifling matter of boundary-lines and customs,which I undertook at the Duke's desire, the more readily, it must beowned, since it gave me the opportunity to renew my acquaintance withfriends whom absence has not taught me to forget." He smiled again atDonna Laura, who blushed like a girl.</p> 
<p>　　The curiosity which Trescorre's words excited was lost to Odo in thepainful impression produced by his mother's agitation. To see her, awoman already past her youth, and aged by her very efforts to preserveit, trembling and bridling under the cool eye of masculine indifference,was a spectacle the more humiliating that he was too young to be movedby its human and pathetic side. He recalled once seeing a memento moriof delicately-tinted ivory, which represented a girl's head, one sideall dewy freshness, the other touched with death; and it seemed to himthat his mother's face resembled this tragic toy, the side her mirrorreflected being still rosy with youth, while that which others saw wasalready a ruin. His heart burned with disgust as he followed Donna Lauraand Trescorre into the dining-room, which had been set out with all thefamily plate, and decked with rare fruits and flowers. The Countess hadexcused her husband on the plea of his official duties, and the threesat down alone to a meal composed of the costliest delicacies.</p> 
<p>　　Their guest, who ate little and drank less, entertained them with thelatest news of Pianura, touching discreetly on the growing estrangementbetween the Duke and Duchess, and speaking with becoming gravity of theheir's weak health. It was clear that the speaker, without filling anofficial position at the court, was already deep in the Duke's counsels,and perhaps also in the Duchess's; and Odo guessed under his smilingindiscretions the cool aim of the man who never wastes a shot.</p> 
<p>　　Toward the close of the meal, when the servants had withdrawn, he turnedto Odo with a graver manner. "You have perhaps guessed, cavaliere," hesaid, "that in venturing to claim the Countess's hospitality in soprivate a manner, I had in mind the wish to open myself to you morefreely than would be possible at court." He paused a moment, as thoughto emphasise his words; and Odo fancied he cultivated the trick ofdeliberate speaking to counteract his natural arrogance of manner. "Thetime has come," he went on, "when it seems desirable that you should bemore familiar with the state of affairs at Pianura. For some years itseemed likely that the Duchess would give his Highness another son; butcircumstances now appear to preclude that hope; and it is the generalopinion of the court physicians that the young prince has not many yearsto live." He paused again, fixing his eyes on Odo's flushed face. "TheDuke," he continued, "has shown a natural reluctance to face a situationso painful both to his heart and his ambitions; but his feelings as aparent have yielded to his duty as a sovereign, and he recognises thefact that you should have an early opportunity of acquainting yourselfmore nearly with the affairs of the duchy, and also of seeing somethingof the other courts of Italy. I am persuaded," he added, "that, young asyou are, I need not point out to you on what slight contingencies allhuman fortunes hang, and how completely the heir's recovery or the birthof another prince must change the aspect of your future. You have, I amsure, the heart to face such chances with becoming equanimity, and tocarry the weight of conditional honours without any undue faith in theirpermanence."The admonition was so lightly uttered that it seemed rather a tribute toOdo's good sense than a warning to his inexperience; and indeed it wasdifficult for him, in spite of an instinctive aversion to the man, toquarrel with anything in his address or language. Trescorre in factpossessed the art of putting younger men at their ease, while appearingas an equal among his elders: a gift doubtless developed by thecircumstances of court life, and the need of at once commanding respectand disarming diffidence.</p> 
<p>　　He took leave upon his last words, declaring, in reply to the Countess'sprotests, that he had promised to accompany the court that afternoon toStupinigi. "But I hope," he added, turning to Odo, "to continue our talkat greater length, if you will favour me with a visit tomorrow at mylodgings."No sooner was the door closed on her illustrious visitor than DonnaLaura flung herself on Odo's bosom.</p> 
<p>　　"I always knew it," she cried, "my dearest; but, oh, that I should liveto see the day!" and she wept and clung to him with a thousandendearments, from the nature of which he gathered that she alreadybeheld him on the throne of Pianura. To his laughing reminder of thedistance that still separated him from that dizzy eminence, she madeanswer that there was far more than he knew, that the Duke had falleninto all manner of excesses which had already gravely impaired hishealth, and that for her part she only hoped her son, when raised to astation so far above her own, would not forget the tenderness with whichshe had ever cherished him, or the fact that Count Valdu's financialsituation was one quite unworthy the stepfather of a reigning prince.</p> 
<p>　　Escaping at length from this parody of his own sensations, Odo foundhimself in a tumult of mind that solitude served only to increase.</p> 
<p>　　Events had so pressed upon him within the last few days that at times hewas reduced to a passive sense of spectatorship, an inability to regardhimself as the centre of so many converging purposes. It was clear thatTrescorre's mission was mainly a pretext for seeing the Duke's youngkinsman; and that some special motive must have impelled the Duke toshow such sudden concern for his cousin's welfare. Trescorre need hardlyhave cautioned Odo against fixing his hopes on the succession. The Dukehimself was a man not above five-and-thirty, and more than one chancestood between Odo and the duchy; nor was it this contingency that sethis pulses beating, but rather the promise of an immediate change in hiscondition. The Duke wished him to travel, to visit the different courtsof Italy: what was the prospect of ruling over a stagnant principalityto this near vision of the world and the glories thereof, suddenlydiscovered from the golden height of opportunity? Save for a few weeksof autumn villeggiatura at some neighbouring chase or vineyard, Odo hadnot left Turin for nine years. He had come there a child and had grownto manhood among the same narrow influences and surroundings. To beturned loose on the world at two-and-twenty, with such an arrears ofexperience to his credit, was to enter on a richer inheritance than anyduchy; and in Odo's case the joy of the adventure was doubled by itstimeliness. That fate should thus break at a stroke the meshes of habit,should stoop to play the advocate of his secret inclinations, seemed topromise him the complicity of the gods. Once in a lifetime, chance willthus snap the toils of a man's making; and it is instructive to see thepoor puppet adore the power that connives at his evasion...</p> 
<p>　　Trescorre remained a week in Turin; and Odo saw him daily at court, athis lodgings, or in company. The little sovereignty of Pianura being animportant factor in the game of political equilibrium, her envoy wassure of a flattering reception from the neighbouring powers; andTrescorre's person and address must have commended him to the mostfastidious company. He continued to pay particular attention to Odo, andthe rumour was soon abroad that the Cavaliere Valsecca had been sent forto visit his cousin, the reigning Duke; a rumour which, combined withDonna Laura's confidential hints, made Odo the centre of much femininesolicitude, and roused the Countess Clarice to a vivid sense of herrights. These circumstances, and his own tendency to drift on thecurrent of sensation, had carried Odo more easily than he could havehoped past the painful episode of the Professor's garden. He was stilltormented by the sense of his inability to right so grave a wrong; buthe found solace in the thought that his absence was after all the bestreparation he could make.</p> 
<p>　　Trescorre, though distinguishing Odo by his favours, had not againreferred to the subject of their former conversation; but on the lastday of his visit he sent for Odo to his lodgings and at once enteredupon the subject.</p> 
<p>　　"His Highness," said he, "does not for the present recommend yourresigning your commission in the Sardinian army; but as he desires youto visit him at Pianura, and to see something of the neighbouringcourts, he has charged me to obtain for you a two years' leave ofabsence from his Majesty's service: a favour the King has already beenpleased to accord. The Duke has moreover resolved to double your presentallowance and has entrusted me with the sum of two hundred ducats, whichhe desires you to spend in the purchase of a travelling-carriage, andsuch other appointments as are suitable to a gentleman of your rank andexpectations." As he spoke, he unlocked his despatch-box and handed apurse to Odo. "His Highness," he continued, "is impatient to see you;and once your preparations are completed, I should advise you to set outwithout delay; that is," he added, after one of his characteristicpauses, "if I am right in supposing that there is no obstacle to yourdeparture."Odo, inferring an allusion to the Countess Clarice, smiled and colouredslightly. "I know of none," he said.</p> 
<p>　　Trescorre bowed. "I am glad to hear it," he said, "for I know that a manof your age and appearance may have other inclinations than his own toconsider. Indeed, I have had reports of a connection that I should nottake the liberty of mentioning, were it not that your interest demandsit." He waited a moment, but Odo remained silent. "I am sure," he wenton, "you will do me the justice of believing that I mean no reflectionon the lady, when I warn you against being seen too often in the quarterbehind the Corpus Domini. Such attachments, though engaging at theoutset to a fastidious taste, are often more troublesome than a youngman of your age can foresee; and in this case the situation iscomplicated by the fact that the girl's father is in ill odour with theauthorities, so that, should the motive of your visits be mistaken, youmight find yourself inconveniently involved in the proceedings of theHoly Office."Odo, who had turned pale, controlled himself sufficiently to listen insilence, and with as much pretence of indifference as he could assume.</p> 
<p>　　It was the peculiar misery of his situation that he could not defendFulvia without betraying her father, and that of the two alternativesprudence bade him reject the one that chivalry would have chosen. Itflashed across him, however, that he might in some degree repair theharm he had done by finding out what measures were to be taken againstVivaldi; and to this end he carelessly asked:--"Is it possible that theProfessor has done anything to give offence in such quarters?"His assumption of carelessness was perhaps overdone; for Trescorre'sface grew as blank as a shuttered house-front.</p> 
<p>　　"I have heard rumours of the kind," he rejoined; "but they wouldscarcely have attracted my notice had I not learned of your honouringthe young lady with your favours." He glanced at Odo with a smile. "WereI a father," he added, "with a son of your age, my first advice to himwould be to form no sentimental ties but in his own society or in theworld of pleasure--the only two classes where the rules of the game areunderstood."</p>
