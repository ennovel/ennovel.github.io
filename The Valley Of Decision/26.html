This cryof a more famous traveller must have struggled for expression in Odo'sbreast as the great city, the city of cities, laid her irresistible holdupon him. His first impression, as he drove in the clear evening lightfrom the Porta del Popolo to his lodgings in the Via Sistina, was of aprodigious accumulation of architectural effects, a crowding of centuryon century, all fused in the crucible of the Roman sun, so that eachstyle seemed linked to the other by some subtle affinity of colour.</p> 
<p>　　Nowhere else, surely, is the traveller's first sight so crowded withsurprises, with conflicting challenges to eye and brain. Here, as hepassed, was a fragment of the ancient Servian wall, there a new stuccoshrine embedded in the bricks of a medieval palace; on one hand a loftyterrace crowned by a row of mouldering busts, on the other a tower withmachicolated parapet, its flanks encrusted with bits of Roman sculptureand the escutcheons of seventeenth-century Popes. Opposite, perhaps, oneof Fuga's golden-brown churches, with windy saints blowing out of theirniches, overlooked the nereids of a barocco fountain, or an old housepropped itself like a palsied beggar against a row of Corinthiancolumns; while everywhere flights of steps led up and down to hanginggardens or under archways, and each turn revealed some distant glimpseof convent-walls on the slope of a vineyard or of red-brown ruinsprofiled against the dim sea-like reaches of the Campagna.</p> 
<p>　　Afterward, as order was born out of chaos, and he began to thread hisway among the centuries, this first vision lost something of itsintensity; yet it was always, to the last, through the eye that Romepossessed him. Her life, indeed, as though in obedience to such asetting, was an external, a spectacular business, from the wildanimation of the cattle-market in the Forum or the hucksters' trafficamong the fountains of the Piazza Navona, to the pompous entertainmentsin the cardinals' palaces and the ever-recurring religious ceremoniesand processions. Pius VI., in the reaction from Ganganelli's democraticways, had restored the pomp and ceremonial of the Vatican with thereligious discipline of the Holy Office; and never perhaps had Rome beenmore splendid on the surface or more silent and empty within. Odo, attimes, as he moved through some assemblage of cardinals and nobles, hadthe sensation of walking through a huge reverberating palace, decked outwith all the splendours of art but long since abandoned of men. Thesuperficial animation, the taste for music and antiquities, all thedilettantisms of an idle and irresponsible society, seemed to him toshrivel to dust in the glare of that great past that lit up every cornerof the present.</p> 
<p>　　Through his own connections, and the influence of de Crucis, he saw allthat was best not only among the nobility, but in that ecclesiasticallife now more than ever predominant in Rome. Here at last he was face toface with the mighty Sphinx, and with the bleaching bones of those whohad tried to guess her riddle. Wherever he went these "lost adventurers"walked the streets with him, gliding between the Princes of the Churchin the ceremonies of Saint Peter's and the Lateran, or mingling in thecompany that ascended the state staircase at some cardinal's levee.</p> 
<p>　　He met indeed many accomplished and amiable ecclesiastics, but it seemedto him that the more thoughtful among them had either acquired theirpeace of mind at the cost of a certain sensitiveness, or had takenrefuge in a study of the past, as the early hermits fled to the desertfrom the disorders of Antioch and Alexandria. None seemed disposed toface the actual problems of life, and this attitude of caution orindifference had produced a stagnation of thought that contrastedstrongly with the animation of Sir William Hamilton's circle in Naples.</p> 
<p>　　The result in Odo's case was a reaction toward the pleasures of his age;and of these Rome had but few to offer. He spent some months in thestudy of the antique, purchasing a few good examples of sculpture forthe Duke, and then, without great reluctance, set out for Monte Alloro.</p> 
<p>　　Here he found a changed atmosphere. The Duke welcomed him handsomely,and bestowed the highest praise on the rarities he had collected; butfor the moment the court was ruled by a new favourite, to whom Odo'scoming was obviously unwelcome. This adroit adventurer, whose name wassoon to become notorious throughout Europe, had taken the old prince byhis darling weaknesses, and Odo, having no mind to share in the excessesof the precious couple, seized the first occasion to set out again onhis travels.</p> 
<p>　　His course had now become one of aimless wandering; for prudence stillforbade his return to Pianura, and his patron's indifference left himfree to come and go as he chose. He had brought from Rome--that albergod'ira--a settled melancholy of spirit, which sought refuge in suchdistractions as the moment offered. In such a mood change of scene was anecessity, and he resolved to employ the next months in visiting severalof the mid-Italian cities. Toward Florence he was specially drawn by thefact that Alfieri now lived there; but, as often happens after suchseparations, the reunion was a disappointment. Alfieri, indeed, warmlywelcomed his friend; but he was engrossed in his dawning passion for theCountess of Albany, and that lady's pitiable situation excluded allother interests from his mind. To Odo, to whom the years had brought anincreasing detachment, this self-absorption seemed an arrest in growth;for Alfieri's early worship of liberty had not yet found its destinedchannel of expression, and for the moment his enthusiasms had shrunk tothe compass of a romantic adventure. The friends parted after a few daysof unsatisfying intercourse; and it was under the influence of thisfinal disenchantment that Odo set out for Venice.</p> 
<p>　　It was the vintage season, and the travellers descended from theApennines on a landscape diversified by the picturesque incidents of thegrape-gathering. On every slope stood some villa with awnings spread,and merry parties were picnicking among the vines or watching thepeasants at their work. Cantapresto, who had shown great reluctance atleaving Monte Alloro, where, as he declared, he found himself as snug asan eel in a pasty, was now all eagerness to press forward; and Odo wasin the mood to allow any influence to decide his course. He had aninvaluable courier in Cantapresto, whose enormous pretensions generallyassured him the best lodging and the fastest conveyance to be obtained,and who was never happier than when outwitting a rival emissary, orbribing a landlord to serve up on Odo's table the repast ordered inadvance for some distinguished traveller. His impatience to reachVenice, which he described as the scene of all conceivable delights, hadon this occasion tripled his zeal, and they travelled rapidly to Padua,where he had engaged a burchiello for the passage down the Brenta. Here,however, he found he had been outdone at his own game; for the servantof an English Duke had captured the burchiello and embarked his nobleparty before Cantapresto reached the wharf. This being the season of thevilleggiatura, when the Venetian nobility were exchanging visits on themainland, every conveyance was in motion and no other boat to be had fora week; while as for the "bucentaur" or public bark, which was just thengetting under way, it was already packed to the gunwale with Jews,pedlars and such vermin, and the captain swore by the three thousandrelics of Saint Justina that he had no room on board for so much as ahungry flea.</p> 
<p>　　Odo, who had accompanied Cantapresto to the water-side, was listening tothese assurances and to the soprano's vain invectives, when awell-dressed young man stepped up to the group. This gentleman, whoseaccent and dress showed him to be a Frenchman of quality, told Odo thathe was come from Vicenza, whither he had gone to engage a company ofactors for his friend the Procuratore Bra, who was entertaining adistinguished company at his villa on the Brenta; that he was nowreturning with his players, and that he would be glad to convey Odo sofar on his road to Venice. His friend's seat, he added, was near Oriago,but a few miles above Fusina, where a public conveyance might always befound; so that Odo would doubtless be able to proceed the same night toVenice.</p> 
<p>　　This civil offer Odo at once accepted, and the Frenchman thereuponsuggested that, as the party was to set out the next day at sunrise, thetwo should sup together and pass the intervening hours in suchdiversions as the city offered. They returned to the inn, where theactors were also lodged, and Odo's host having ordered a handsomesupper, proposed, with his guest's permission, to invite the leadingmembers of the company to partake of it. He departed on this errand; andgreat was Odo's wonder, when the door reopened, to discover, among theparty it admitted, his old acquaintance of Vercelli, the Count ofCastelrovinato. The latter, whose dress and person had been refurbished,and who now wore an air of rakish prosperity, greeted him with evidentpleasure, and, while their entertainer was engaged in seating the ladiesof the company, gave him a brief account of the situation.</p> 
<p>　　The young French gentleman (whom he named as the Marquis deCoeur-Volant) had come to Italy some months previously on the grandtour, and having fallen a victim to the charms of Venice, had declaredthat, instead of continuing on his travels, he meant to complete hiseducation in that famous school of pleasure. Being master of his ownfortune, he had hired a palace on the Grand Canal, had dispatched hisgovernor (a simple archaeologist) on a mission of exploration to Sicilyand Greece, and had devoted himself to an assiduous study of Venetianmanners. Among those contributing to his instruction was Mirandolina ofChioggia, who had just completed a successful engagement at the theatreof San Moise in Venice. Wishing to detain her in the neighbourhood, heradorer had prevailed on his friend the Procuratore to give a series ofcomedies at his villa of Bellocchio and had engaged to provide him witha good company of performers. Miranda was of course selected as primaamorosa; and the Marquess, under Castelrovinato's guidance, had then setout to collect the rest of the company. This he had succeeded in doing,and was now returning to Bellocchio, where Miranda was to meet them. Odowas the more diverted at the hazard which had brought him into suchcompany, as the Procuratore Bra was one of the noblemen to whom the oldDuke had specially recommended him. On learning this, the Marquess urgedhim to present his letter of introduction on arriving at Bellocchio,where the Procuratore, who was noted for hospitality to strangers, woulddoubtless insist on his joining the assembled party. This Odo declinedto do; but his curiosity to see Mirandolina made him hope that chancewould soon throw him in the Procuratore's way.</p> 
<p>　　Meanwhile supper was succeeded by music and dancing, and the companybroke up only in time to proceed to the landing-place where their bargeawaited them. This was a private burchiello of the Procuratore's with acommodious antechamber for the servants, and a cabin cushioned indamask. Into this agreeable retreat the actresses were packed with alltheir bags and band-boxes; and their travelling-cloaks being rolled intopillows, they were soon asleep in a huddle of tumbled finery.</p> 
<p>　　Odo and his host preferred to take the air on deck. The sun was risingabove the willow-clad banks of the Brenta, and it was pleasant to glidein the clear early light past sleeping gardens and villas, and vineyardswhere the peasants were already at work. The wind setting from the sea,they travelled slowly and had full leisure to view the succession ofsplendid seats interspersed with gardens, the thriving villages, and thepoplar-groves festooned with vines. Coeur-Volant spoke eloquently of thepleasures to be enjoyed in this delightful season of the villeggiatura.</p> 
<p>　　"Nowhere," said he, "do people take their pleasures so easily andnaturally as in Venice. My countrymen claim a superiority in this art,and it may be they possessed it a generation ago. But what a moroseplace is France become since philosophy has dethroned enjoyment! If yougo on a visit to one of our noblemen's seats, what do you find there, Iask? Cards, comedies, music, the opportunity for an agreeable intriguein the society of your equals? No--but a hostess engaged in suckling andbathing her brats, or in studying chemistry and optics with some dirtyschool-master, who is given the seat of honour at table and a pavilionin the park to which he may retire when weary of the homage of thegreat; while as for the host, he is busy discussing education orpolitical economy with his unfortunate guests, if, indeed, he is notdragging them through leagues of mud and dust to inspect his latestexperiments in forestry and agriculture, or to hear a pack of snufflingschool-children singing hymns to the God of Nature! And what," hecontinued, "is the result of it all? The peasants are starving, thetaxes are increasing, the virtuous landlords are ruining themselves infarming on scientific principles, the tradespeople are grumbling becausethe nobility do not spend their money in Paris, the court is dull, theclergy are furious, the Queen mopes, the King is frightened, and thewhole French people are yawning themselves to death from Normandy toProvence.""Yes," said Castelrovinato with his melancholy smile, "the test ofsuccess is to have had one's money's worth; but experience, which isdried pleasure, is at best a dusty diet, as we know. Yonder, in a foldof those hills," he added, pointing to the cluster of Euganean mountainsjust faintly pencilled above the plain, "lies the little fief from whichI take my name. Acre by acre, tree by tree, it has gone to pay for myexperiments, not in agriculture but in pleasure; and whenever I lookover at it from Venice and reflect on what each rood of ground or trunkof tree has purchased, I wonder to see my life as bare as ever for allthat I have spent on it."The young Marquess shrugged his shoulders. "And would your life," heexclaimed, "have been a whit less bare had you passed it in yourancestral keep among those windy hills, in the company of swineherds andcharcoal-burners, with a milk-maid for your mistress and the villagepriest for your partner at picquet?""Perhaps not," the other agreed. "There is a tale of a man who spent hislife in wishing he had lived differently; and when he died he wassurrounded by a throng of spectral shapes, each one exactly like theother, who, on his asking what they were, replied: 'We are all thedifferent lives you might have lived.'""If you are going to tell ghost-stories," cried Coeur-Volant, "I willcall for a bottle of Canary!""And I," rejoined the Count good-humouredly, "will try to coax theladies forth with a song;" and picking up his lute, which always laywithin reach, he began to sing in the Venetian dialect:--There's a villa on the BrentaWhere the statues, white as snow,All along the water-terracePerch like sea-gulls in a row.</p> 
<p>　　There's a garden on the BrentaWhere the fairest ladies meet,Picking roses from the trellisFor the gallants at their feet.</p> 
<p>　　There's an arbour on the BrentaMade of yews that screen the light,Where I kiss my girl at middayClose as lovers kiss at night.</p> 
<p>　　The players soon emerged at this call and presently the deck resoundedwith song and laughter. All the company were familiar with the Venetianbacaroles, and Castelrovinato's lute was passed from hand to hand, asone after another, incited by the Marquess's Canary, tried to recallsome favourite measure--"La biondina in gondoleta" or "Guarda, che bellaluna."Meanwhile life was stirring in the villages and gardens, and groups ofpeople appearing on the terraces overhanging the water. Never had Odobeheld a livelier scene. The pillared houses with their rows of statuesand vases, the flights of marble steps descending to the gildedriver-gates, where boats bobbed against the landings and boatmen gaspedin the shade of their awnings; the marble trellises hung with grapes,the gardens where parterres of flowers and parti-coloured gravelalternated with the dusk of tunnelled yew-walks; the company playing atbowls in the long alleys, or drinking chocolate in gazebos above theriver; the boats darting hither and thither on the stream itself, thetravelling-chaises, market-waggons and pannier-asses crowding thecauseway along the bank--all were unrolled before him with as littleeffect of reality as the episodes woven in some gaily-tinted tapestry.</p> 
<p>　　Even the peasants in the vineyards seemed as merry and thoughtless asthe quality in their gardens. The vintage-time is the holiday of therural year and the day's work was interspersed with frequent intervalsof relaxation. At the villages where the burchiello touched forrefreshments, handsome young women in scarlet bodices came on board withbaskets of melons, grapes, figs and peaches; and under the trellises onthe landings, lads and girls with flowers in their hair were dancing themonferrina to the rattle of tambourines or the chant of some wanderingballad-singer. These scenes were so engaging to the comedians that theycould not be restrained from going ashore and mingling in the villagediversions; and the Marquess, though impatient to rejoin his divinity,was too volatile not to be drawn into the adventure. The whole partyaccordingly disembarked, and were presently giving an exhibition oftheir talents to the assembled idlers, the Pantaloon, Harlequin andDoctor enacting a comical intermezzo which Cantapresto had that morningcomposed for them, while Scaramouch and Columbine joined the dancers,and the rest of the company, seizing on a train of donkeys laden withvegetables for the Venetian market, stripped these patient animals oftheir panniers, and mounting them bareback started a Corso around thevillage square amid the invectives of the drivers and the applause ofthe crowd.</p> 
<p>　　Day was declining when the Marquess at last succeeded in driving hisflock to their fold, and the moon sent a quiver of brightness across thewater as the burchiello touched at the landing of a villa set amidclose-massed foliage high above the river. Gardens peopled with statuesdescended from the portico of the villa to the marble platform on thewater's edge, where a throng of boatmen in the Procuratore's liveryhurried forward to receive the Marquess and his companions. Thecomedians, sobered by the magnificence of their surroundings, followedtheir leader like awe-struck children. Light and music streamed from thelong facade overhead, but the lower gardens lay hushed and dark, the airfragrant with unseen flowers, the late moon just burnishing the edges ofthe laurel-thickets from which, now and again, a nightingale's songgushed in a fountain of sound. Odo, spellbound, followed the otherswithout a thought of his own share in the adventure. Never before hadbeauty so ministered to every sense. He felt himself lost in hissurroundings, absorbed in the scent and murmur of the night.</p>
