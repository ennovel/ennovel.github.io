The philosopher's countenancewas perturbed, his travelling-coat spattered with mud, and his daughter,hooded and veiled, clung to him with an air of apprehension that smoteOdo to the heart. He caught a blush of recognition beneath her veil; andas he drew near she raised a finger to her lip and faintly shook herhead.</p> 
<p>　　The mute signal reassured him. "I see, sir," said he, turningcourteously to Vivaldi, "that you are in a bad plight, and I hope that Ior my carriage may be of service to you." He ventured a second glance atFulvia, but she had turned aside and was inspecting the wheel of thechaise with an air of the most disheartening detachment.</p> 
<p>　　Vivaldi, who had returned Odo's greeting without any sign of ill-will,bowed slightly and seemed to hesitate a moment. "Our plight, as yousee," he said, "is indeed a grave one; for the wheel has come off ourcarriage and my driver here tells me there is no smithy this sideVercelli, where it is imperative we should lie tonight. I hope,however," he added, glancing down the road, "that with all the trafficnow coming and going we may soon be overtaken by some vehicle that willcarry us to our destination."He spoke calmly, but it was plain some pressing fear underlay hiscomposure, and the nature of the emergency was but too clear to Odo.</p> 
<p>　　"Will not my carriage serve you?" he hastily rejoined. "I am forVercelli, and if you will honour me with your company we can go forwardat once."Fulvia, during this exchange of words, had affected to be engaged withthe luggage, which lay in a heap beside the chaise; but at this pointshe lifted her head and shot a glance at her father from under her blacktravelling-hood.</p> 
<p>　　Vivaldi's constraint increased. "This, sir," said he, "is a handsomeoffer, and one for which I thank you; but I fear our presence mayincommode you and the additional weight of our luggage perhaps delayyour progress. I have little fear but some van or waggon will overtakeus before nightfall; and should it chance otherwise," he added with atouch of irresistible pedantry, "why, it behoves us to remember that weshall be none the worse off, since the sage is independent ofcircumstances."Odo could hardly repress a smile. "Such philosophy, sir, is admirable inprinciple, but in practice hardly applicable to a lady unused to passingher nights in a rice-field. The region about here is notoriouslyunhealthy and you will surely not expose your daughter to the risk ofremaining by the roadside or of finding a lodging in some peasant'shut."Vivaldi drew himself up. "My daughter," said he, "has been trained toface graver emergencies with an equanimity I have no fear of putting tothe touch--'the calm of a mind blest in the consciousness of itsvirtue'; and were it not that circumstances are somewhat pressing--" hebroke off and glanced at Cantapresto, who was fidgeting about Odo'scarriage or talking in undertones with the driver of the chaise.</p> 
<p>　　"Come, sir," said Odo urgently, "Let my servants put your luggage up andwe'll continue this argument on the road."Vivaldi again paused. "Sir," he said at length, "will you first stepaside with me a moment?" he led Odo a few paces down the road. "I makeno pretence," he went on when they were out of Cantapresto's hearing,"of concealing from you that this offer comes very opportune to ourneeds, for it is urgent we should be out of Piedmont by tomorrow. Butbefore accepting a seat in your carriage, I must tell you that you offerit to a proscribed man; since I have little reason to doubt that by thistime the sbirri are on my track."It was impossible to guess from Vivaldi's manner whether he suspectedOdo of being the cause of his misadventure; and the young man, thoughflushing to the forehead, took refuge in the thought of Fulvia's signaland maintained a self-possessed silence.</p> 
<p>　　"The motive of my persecution," Vivaldi continued, "I need hardlyexplain to one acquainted with my house and with the aims and opinionsof those who frequent it. We live, alas, in an age when it is a moraloffence to seek enlightenment, a political crime to share it withothers. I have long foreseen that any attempt to raise the condition ofmy countrymen must end in imprisonment or flight; and though perhaps tohave suffered the former had been a more impressive vindication of myviews, why, sir, the father at the last moment overruled thephilosopher, and thinking of my poor girl there, who but for me standsalone in the world, I resolved to take refuge in a state where a man maywork for the liberty of others without endangering his own."Odo had listened with rising eagerness. Was not here an opportunity, ifnot to atone, at least to give practical evidence of his contrition?</p> 
<p>　　"What you tell me sir," he exclaimed, "cannot but increase my zeal toserve you. Here is no time to palter. I am on my way to Lombardy, which,from what you say, I take to be your destination also; and if you andyour daughter will give me your company across the border I think youneed fear no farther annoyance from the police, since my passports, asthe Duke of Pianura's cousin, cover any friends I choose to take in mycompany.""Why, sir," said Vivaldi, visibly moved by the readiness of theresponse, "here is a generosity so far in excess of our present needsthat it encourages me to accept the smaller favour of travelling withyou to Vercelli. There we have friends with whom we shall be safe forthe night, and soon after sunrise I hope we may be across the border."Odo at once followed up his advantage by pointing out that it was on theborder that difficulties were most likely to arise; but after a fewmoments of debate Vivaldi declared he must first take counsel with hisdaughter, who still hung like a mute interrogation on the outskirts oftheir talk.</p> 
<p>　　After a few words with her, he returned to Odo. "My daughter," said he,"whose good sense puts my wisdom to the blush, wishes me first toenquire if you purpose returning to Turin; since in that case, as shepoints out, your kindness might result in annoyances to which we have noright to expose you."Odo coloured. "Such considerations, I beg your daughter to believe,would not weigh with me an instant; but as I am leaving Piedmont for twoyears I am not so happy as to risk anything by serving you."Vivaldi on this assurance at once consented to accept a seat in hiscarriage as far as Boffalora, the first village beyond the Sardinianfrontier. It was agreed that at Vercelli Odo was to set down hiscompanions at an inn whence, alone and privately, they might gain theirfriend's house; that on the morrow at daybreak he was to take them up ata point near the convent of the Umiliati, and that thence they were topush forward without a halt for Boffalora.</p> 
<p>　　This agreement reached, Odo was about to offer Fulvia a hand to thecarriage when an unwelcome thought arrested him.</p> 
<p>　　"I hope, sir," said he, again turning to Vivaldi, and blushing furiouslyas he spoke, "that you feel assured of my discretion; but I oughtperhaps to warn you that my companion yonder, though the good-naturedestfellow alive, is not one to live long on good terms with a secret,whether his own or another's.""I am obliged to you," said Vivaldi, "for the hint; but my daughter andI are like those messengers who, in time of war, learn to carry theirdespatches beneath their tongues. You may trust us not to betrayourselves; and your friend may, if he chooses, suppose me to betravelling to Milan to act as governor to a young gentleman of quality."The Professor's luggage had by this been put on Odo's carriage, and thelatter advanced to Fulvia. He had drawn a favourable inference from theconcern she had shown for his welfare; but to his mortification shemerely laid two reluctant finger tips in his hand and took her seatwithout a word of thanks or so much as a glance at her rescuer. Thisunmerited repulse, and the constraint occasioned by Cantapresto'spresence, made the remainder of the drive interminable. Even theProfessor's apposite reflections on rice-growing and the culture of themulberry did little to shorten the way; and when at length thebell-towers of Vercelli rose in sight Odo felt the relief of a man whohas acquitted himself of a tedious duty. He had looked forward with themost romantic anticipations to the outcome of this chance encounter withFulvia; but the unforgiving humour which had lent her a transitory charmnow became as disfiguring as some physical defect; and his heart swelledwith the defiance of youthful disappointment.</p> 
<p>　　It was near the angelus when they entered the city. Just within thegates Odo set down his companions, who took leave of him, the one withthe heartiest expressions of gratitude, the other with a hurriedinclination of her veiled head. Thence he drove on to the Three Crowns,where he designed to lie. The streets were still crowded withholiday-makers and decked out with festal hangings. Tapestries andsilken draperies adorned the balconies of the houses, innumerable tinylamps framed the doors and windows, and the street-shrines were dressedwith a profusion of flowers; while every square and open space in thecity was crowded with booths, with the tents of ambulant comedians anddentists, and with the outspread carpets of snake-charmers,posture-makers and jugglers. Among this mob of quacks and pedlarscirculated other fantastic figures, the camp-followers of the army ofhucksters: dwarfs and cripples, mendicant friars, gypsy fortune-tellers,and the itinerant reciters of Ariosto and Tasso. With these mingled thetowns-people in holiday dress, the well-to-do farmers and their wives,and a throng of nondescript idlers, ranging from the servants of thenobility pushing their way insolently through the crowd, to thosesinister vagabonds who lurk, as it were, in the interstices of everyconcourse of people.</p> 
<p>　　It was not long before the noise and animation about him had dispelledOdo's ill-humour. The world was too fair to be darkened by a girl'sdisdain, and a reaction of feeling putting him in tune with the humoursof the market-place, he at once set forth on foot to view the city. Itwas now near sunset and the day's decline irradiated the stately frontof the Cathedral, the walls of the ancient Hospital that faced it, andthe groups gathered about the stalls and platforms obstructing thesquare. Even in his travelling-dress Odo was not a figure to passunnoticed, and he was soon assailed by laughing compliments on his looksand invitations to visit the various shows concealed behind the flappingcurtains of the tents. There were enough pretty faces in the crowd tojustify such familiarities, and even so modest a success was not withoutsolace to his vanity. He lingered for some time in the square, answeringthe banter of the blooming market-women, inspecting thefiligree-ornaments from Genoa, and watching a little yellow bitch in ahooped petticoat and lappets dance the furlana to the music of anarmless fiddler who held the bow in his teeth. As he turned from thisshow Odo's eye was caught by a handsome girl who, on the arm of adashing cavalier in somewhat shabby velvet, was cheapening a pair ofgloves at a neighbouring stall. The girl, who was masked, shot a darkglance at Odo from under her three-cornered Venetian hat; then, tossingdown a coin, she gathered up the gloves and drew her companion away. Themanoeuvre was almost a challenge, and Odo was about to take it up when apretty boy in a Scaramouch habit, waylaying him with various gracefulantics, thrust a play-bill in his hand; and on looking round he foundthe girl and her gallant had disappeared. The play-bill, with a wealthof theatrical rhetoric, invited Odo to attend the Performance to begiven that evening at the Philodramatic Academy by the celebrated CapoComico Tartaglia of Rimini and his world-renowned company of Comedians,who, in the presence of the aristocracy of Vercelli, were to present anew comedy entitled "Le Gelosie di Milord Zambo," with an Intermezzo ofsinging and dancing by the best Performers of their kind.</p> 
<p>　　Dusk was already falling, and Odo, who had brought no letters to thegentry of Vercelli, where he intended to stay but a night, began towonder how he should employ his evening. He had hoped to spend it inVivaldi's company, but the Professor not having invited him, he saw noprospect but to return to the inn and sup alone with Cantapresto. In thedoorway of the Three Crowns he found the soprano awaiting him.</p> 
<p>　　Cantapresto, who had been as mute as a fish during the afternoon'sdrive, now bustled forward with a great show of eagerness.</p> 
<p>　　"What poet was it," he cried, "that paragoned youth to the Eastersunshine, which, wherever it touches, causes a flower to spring up? Herewe are scarce alit in a strange city, and already a messenger finds theway to our inn with a most particular word from his lady to theCavaliere Odo Valsecca." And he held out a perfumed billet sealed with aflaming dart.</p> 
<p>　　Odo's heart gave a leap at the thought that the letter might be fromFulvia; but on breaking the seal he read these words, scrawled in anunformed hand:--"Will the Cavaliere Valsecca accept from an old friend, who desires torenew her acquaintance with him, the trifling gift of a side-box at DonTartaglia's entertainment this evening?"Vexed at his credulity, Odo tossed the invitation to Cantapresto; but amoment later, recalling the glance of the pretty girl in themarket-place, he began to wonder if the billet might not be the preludeto a sufficiently diverting adventure. It at least offered a way ofpassing the evening; and after a hurried supper he set out withCantapresto for the Philodramatic Academy. It was late when they enteredtheir box, and several masks were already capering before thefootlights, exchanging lazzi with the townsfolk in the pit, andaddressing burlesque compliments to the quality in the boxes. Thetheatre seemed small and shabby after those of Turin, and there waslittle in the old-fashioned fopperies of a provincial audience tointerest a young gentleman fresh from the capital. Odo looked about forany one resembling the masked beauty of the market-place; but he beheldonly ill-dressed dowagers and matrons, or ladies of the town moreconspicuous for their effrontery than for their charms.</p> 
<p>　　The main diversion of the evening was by this begun. It was a comedy inthe style of Goldoni's early pieces, representing the actual life of theday, but interspersed with the antics of the masks, to whose improviseddrolleries the people still clung. A terrific Don Spavento in cloak andsword played the jealous English nobleman, Milord Zambo, and the part ofTartaglia was taken by the manager, one of the best-known interpretersof the character in Italy. Tartaglia was the guardian of the primaamorosa, whom the enamoured Briton pursued; and in the Columbine, whenshe sprang upon the stage with a pirouette that showed her slenderankles and embroidered clocks, Odo instantly recognised the gracefulfigure and killing glance of his masked beauty. Her face, which was nowuncovered, more than fulfilled the promise of her eyes, being indeed asarch and engaging a countenance as ever flashed distraction across thefoot-lights. She was greeted with an outburst of delight that cost her asour glance from the prima amorosa, and presently the theatre wasringing with her improvised sallies, uttered in the gay staccato of theVenetian dialect. There was to Odo something perplexingly familiar inthis accent and in the light darting movements of her little head framedin a Columbine's ruff, with a red rose thrust behind one ear; but aftera rapid glance about the house she appeared to take no notice of him andhe began to think it must be to some one else he owed his invitation.</p> 
<p>　　From this question he was soon diverted by his increasing enjoyment ofthe play. It was not indeed a remarkable example of its kind, beingcrudely enough put together, and turning on a series of ridiculous anddisconnected incidents; but to a taste formed on the frigid eleganciesof Metastasio and the French stage there was something refreshing inthis plunge into the coarse homely atmosphere of the old populartheatre. Extemporaneous comedies were no longer played in the greatcities, and Odo listened with surprise to the swift thrust and parry,the inexhaustible flow of jest and repartee, the readiness with whichthe comedians caught up each other's leads, like dancers whirlingwithout a false step through the mazes of some rapid contradance.</p> 
<p>　　So engaged was he that he no longer observed the Columbine save as afigure in this flying reel; but presently a burst of laughter fixed hisattention and he saw that she was darting across the stage pursued byMilord Zambo, who, furious at the coquetries of his betrothed, wasavenging himself by his attentions to the Columbine. Half way across,her foot caught and she fell on one knee. Zambo rushed to the rescue;but springing up instantly, and feigning to treat his advance as a partof the play, she cried out with a delicious assumption of outrageddignity:--"Not a step farther, villain! Know that it is sacrilege for a commonmortal to embrace one who has been kissed by his most illustriousHighness the Heir-presumptive of Pianura!""Mirandolina of Chioggia!" sprang to Odo's lips. At the same instant theColumbine turned about and swept him a deep curtsey, to the delight ofthe audience, who had no notion of what was going forward, but were inthe humour to clap any whim of their favourite's; then she turned anddarted off the stage, and the curtain fell on a tumult of applause.</p> 
<p>　　Odo had hardly recovered from his confusion when the door of the boxopened and the young Scaramouch he had seen in the market-place peepedin and beckoned to Cantapresto. The soprano rose with alacrity, leavingOdo alone in the dimly-lit box, his mind agrope in a labyrinth ofmemories. A moment later Cantapresto returned with that air of furtiverelish that always proclaimed him the bearer of a tender message. Theone he now brought was to the effect that the Signorina MirandaMalmocco, justly renowned as one of the first Columbines of Italy, hadcharged him to lay at the Cavaliere Valsecca's feet her excuses for theliberty she had taken with his illustrious name, and to entreat that hewould show his magnanimity by supping with her after the play in herroom at the Three Crowns--a request she was emboldened to make by thefact that she was lately from Pianura, and could give him the last newsof the court.</p> 
<p>　　The message chimed with Odo's mood, and the play over he hastened backto the inn with Cantapresto, and bid the landlord send to the SignorinaMiranda's room whatever delicacies the town could provide. Odo onarriving that afternoon had himself given orders that his carriageshould be at the door the next morning an hour before sunrise; and henow repeated these instructions to Cantapresto, charging him on his lifeto see that nothing interfered with their fulfilment. The sopranoobjected that the hour was already late, and that they could easilyperform the day's journey without curtailing their rest; but on Odo'sreiteration of the order he resigned himself, with the remark that itwas a pity old age had no savings-bank for the sleep that youthsquandered.</p>
