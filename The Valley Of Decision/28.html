Odo waited in suspense, not daringto question her, yet sure that if she did not speak then she would neverdo so. All doubt and perplexity of spirit had vanished in the simplesense of her nearness. The throb of her hand in his was like theheart-beat of hope. He felt himself no longer a drifting spectator oflife but a sharer in its gifts and renunciations. Which this meetingwould bring he dared not yet surmise: it was enough that he was withFulvia and that love had freed his spirit.</p> 
<p>　　At length she began to speak. Her agitation was so great that he haddifficulty in piecing together the fragments of her story; but for themoment he was more concerned in regaining her confidence than in seekingto obtain a clear picture of the past. Before she could end, the gondolarounded the corner of the narrow canal skirting the garden-wall of SantaChiara. Alarmed lest he should lose her again he passionately urged herto receive him on the morrow; and after some hesitation she consented. Amoment later their prow touched the postern and the boatman gave a lowcall which proved him no novice at the business. Fulvia signed to Odonot to speak or move; and they sat listening intently for the opening ofthe gate. As soon as it was unbarred she sprang ashore and vanished inthe darkness of the garden; and with a cold sense of failure Odo heardthe bolt slipping back and the stealthy fall of the oars as the gondolaslid away under the shadow of the convent-wall. Whither was he beingcarried and would that bolt ever be drawn for him again? In the sultrydawn the convent loomed forbiddingly as a prison, and he could hardlybelieve that a few hours earlier the very doors now closed against himhad stood open to all the world. They would open again; but whether tohim, who could conjecture? He was resolved to see Fulvia again, but heshrank from the thought of forcing himself upon her. She had promised toreceive him; but what revulsion of feeling might not the morrow bring?</p> 
<p>　　Unable to sleep, he bade the boatmen carry him to the Lido. The sun wasjust rising above the Friulian Alps and the lagoon lay dull and smoothas a breathed-on mirror. As he paced the lonely sands he tried toreconstruct Fulvia's broken story, supplementing it with such details ashis experience of Venetian life suggested. It appeared that after herfather's death she had found herself possessed of a small sum of moneywhich he had painfully accumulated for her during the two years they hadspent in Pavia. Her only thought was to employ this inheritance inpublishing the great work on the origin of civilisation which Vivaldihad completed a few days before his last seizure. Through one of theprofessors of the University, who had been her father's friend, shenegotiated with a printer of Amsterdam for the production of the book,and the terms being agreed on, despatched the money and the manuscriptthither by a sure hand. Both were duly delivered and the publisher hadadvanced so far in his work as to send Fulvia the proof-sheets of thefirst chapters, when he took alarm at the renewed activity of the HolyOffice in France and Italy, declared there would be no market for thebook in the present state of affairs, and refused either to continueprinting it, or to restore the money, which he said had barely coveredthe setting-up of the type. Fulvia then attempted to recover themanuscript; but the publisher refusing to surrender it, she foundherself doubly beggared at a stroke.</p> 
<p>　　In this extremity she turned to a sister of her father's, who lived nearTreviso; and this excellent woman, though persuaded that her brother'sheretical views had doomed him to everlasting torment, did not scrupleto offer his child a home. Here Fulvia had lived for two years when heraunt's sudden death left her destitute; for the good lady, to atone forhaving given shelter to a niece of doubtful orthodoxy, had left thewhole of her small property to the Church.</p> 
<p>　　Fulvia's only other relations were certain distant cousins of hermother's, members of the Venetian nobility, but of the indigent classcalled Barnabotti, who lived on the bounty of the state. While inTreviso she had made the acquaintance of one of these cousins, astirring noisy fellow involved in all the political agitations of thestate. It was among the Barnabotti, the class most indebted to thegovernment, that these seditious movements generally arose; and Fulvia'scousin was one of the most notorious malcontents of his order. She hadmistaken his revolutionary bluster for philosophic enlightenment; and,persuaded that he shared in her views, she rashly appealed to him forhelp. With the most eloquent expressions of sympathy he offered her ahome under his own roof; but on reaching Venice she was but ill-receivedby his wife and family, who made no scruple of declaring that, being butpensioners themselves, they were in no state to nourish their pauperrelatives. Fulvia could not but own that they were right; for they livedin the garret of a half-ruined house, pawning their very beds to pay forices in the Piazza and sitting at home all the week in dirty shifts andnight-caps that they might go to mass in silk and powder on a Sunday.</p> 
<p>　　After two months of wretchedness with these unfriendly hosts, whom shevainly tried to conciliate by a hundred little services and attentionsthe poor girl resolved to return to Milan, where she hoped to obtainsome menial position in the household of one of her father's friends.</p> 
<p>　　Her cousins, at this, made a great outcry, protesting that none of theirblood should so demean herself, and that they would spare no efforts tofind some better way of providing for her. Their noble connections gaveFulvia the hope that they might obtain a small pension for her, and sheunsuspiciously yielded to their wishes; but to her dismay she learned afew weeks later, that, thanks to their exertions, she was to be admittedas a novice to the convent of Santa Chiara. Though it was the common wayof disposing of portionless girls, the liberal views of her cousins hadreassured Fulvia, and she woke to her fate too late to escape it. Shewas to enter on her novitiate on the morrow; but even had delay beenpossible she knew that both the civil and religious authorities wouldsustain her family in their course.</p> 
<p>　　Her cousins, knowing her independent spirit, and perhaps fearing anoutcry if they sequestered her too closely, had thought to soften herresistance by placing her in a convent noted for its leniencies; but toFulvia such surroundings were more repugnant than the strictest monasticdiscipline. The corruption of the religious orders was a favourite topicwith her father's friends, and the Venetian nuns were noted throughoutItaly for their frivolous and dissipated lives; but nothing that Fulviahad heard or imagined approached the realities that awaited her. Atfirst the mere sense of imprisonment, of being cut off forever from theworld of free thought and action which had been her native element,overwhelmed every other feeling, and she lay numb in the clutch of fate.</p> 
<p>　　But she was too young for this merciful torpor to last, and with thereturning consciousness of her situation came the instinctive effort toamend it. How she longed then to have been buried in some strict order,where she might have spent her days in solitary work and meditation! Howshe loathed the petty gossip of the nuns, their furtive reaching afterforbidden pleasures! The blindest bigotry would have been lessinsufferable than this clandestine commerce with the world, thestrictest sequestration than this open parody of the monastic calling.</p> 
<p>　　She sought in vain among her companions for an answering mind. Many,like herself, were in open rebellion against their lot; but for reasonsso different that the feeling was an added estrangement. At last thelonging to escape over-mastered every other sensation. It became a fixedidea, a devouring passion. She did not trust herself to think of whatmust follow, but centred every faculty on the effort of evasion.</p> 
<p>　　At this point in her story her growing distress had made it hard for Odoto gather more than a general hint of her meaning. It was clear,however, that she had found her sole hope of escape lay in gaining thefriendship of one of the more favoured nuns. Her own position in thecommunity was of the humblest, for she had neither rank nor wealth tocommend her; but her skill on the harpsichord had attracted the noticeof the music-mistress and she had been enrolled in the convent orchestrabefore her novitiate was over. This had brought her into contact with afew of the more favoured sisters, and among them she had recognised inSister Mary of the Crucifix the daughter of the nobleman who had beenher aunt's landlord at Treviso. Fulvia's name was not unknown to thehandsome nun, and the coincidence was enough to draw them together in acommunity where such trivial affinities must replace the ties of nature.</p> 
<p>　　Fulvia soon learned that Mary of the Crucifix was the spoiled darling ofthe convent. Her beauty and spirit, as much perhaps as her familyconnections, had given her this predominance; and no scruples interferedwith her use of it. Finding herself, as she declared, on the wrong sideof the grate, she determined to gather in all the pleasures she couldreach through it; and her reach was certainly prodigious. Here Odo hadbeen obliged to fall back on his knowledge of Venetian customs toconjecture the incidents leading up to the scene of the previous night.</p> 
<p>　　He divined that Fulvia, maddened by having had to pronounce theirrevocable vows, had resolved to fly at all hazards; that Sister Mary,unconscious of her designs, had proposed to take her on a party ofpleasure, and that the rash girl, blind to every risk but that of delay,had seized on this desperate means of escape. What must have followedhad she not chanced on Odo, she had clearly neither the courage nor theexperience to picture; but she seemed to have had some confused idea ofthrowing herself on the mercy of the foreign nobleman she believed shewas to meet.</p> 
<p>　　So much Odo had gathered; and her voice, her gesture, the disorder ofher spirit, supplied what her words omitted. Not for a moment, either inlistening to her or in the soberer period of revision, did he questionthe exact truth of her narrative. It was the second time that they hadmet under strange circumstances; yet now as before the sense of hercandour was his ruling thought. He concluded that, whatever plight shefound herself in, she would be its immediate justification; and feltsure he must have reached this conclusion though love had not had astake in the verdict. This perhaps but proved him the more deeply taken;for it is when passion tightens the net that reason flaps her wings mostloudly.</p> 
<p>　　Day was high when he returned to his lodgings, impatient for a word fromFulvia. None had come; and as the hours passed he yielded to the mostdisheartening fancies. His wretchedness was increased by the thoughtthat he had once inflicted on her such suspense he was now enduring; andhe went so far as to wonder if this were her revenge for Vercelli. Butif the past was intolerable to consider the future was all bafflingfears. His immediate study was how to see her; and this her continuedsilence seemed to refuse him. The extremity of her plight was his bestally; yet here again anxiety suggested that his having been the witnessof her humiliation must insensibly turn her against him. Never perhapsdoes a man show less knowledge of human nature than in speculating onthe conduct of his beloved; and every step in the labyrinth of hisconjectures carried Odo farther from the truth. This rose on him atnightfall, in the shape of a letter slipped in his hand by a lay-sisteras he crossed the square before his lodgings. He stepped to the light ofthe nearest shrine and read the few words in a tumult. "This beingFriday, no visitors are admitted to the convent; but I entreat you tocome to me tomorrow an hour before benediction." A postcript added: "Itis the hour when visitors are most frequent."He saw her meaning in a flash: his best chance of speaking with her wasin a crowd, and his heart bounded at the significance of her admission.</p> 
<p>　　Now indeed he felt himself lord of the future. Nothing counted but thathe was to see her. His horizon was narrowed to the bars through whichher hand would greet him; yet never had the world appeared so vast.</p> 
<p>　　Long before the hour appointed he was at the gate of Santa Chiara. Heasked to speak with Sister Veronica and the portress led him to theparlour. Several nuns were already behind the grate, chatting with agroup of fashionable ladies and their gallants; but Fulvia was not amongthem. In a few moments the portress returned and informed Odo thatSister Veronica was indisposed and unable to leave her cell. His heartsank, and he asked if she had sent no message. The portress answered inthe negative, but added that the abbess begged him to come to herparlour; and at this his hopes took wing again.</p> 
<p>　　The abbess's parlour was preceded by a handsome antechamber, where Odowas bidden to wait. It was doubtless the Reverend Mother's hour forreceiving company, for through the door beyond he heard laughter andmusic and the sound of lively talk. Presently this door opened and Maryof the Crucifix entered. In her monastic habit she looked coarse andoverblown: the severe lines and sober tints of the dress did not becomeher. Odo felt an insurmountable repugnance at seeing her. He could notconceive why Fulvia had chosen such an intermediary, and for the firsttime a stealing doubt tainted his thoughts of her.</p> 
<p>　　Sister Mary seemed to read his mind. "You bear me a grudge," said shegaily; "but I think you will live to own that I do not return it. Comewith me if you wish to speak with Sister Veronica."Odo flushed with surprise. "She is not too unwell to receive me?"Sister Mary raised her eyebrows in astonishment. "To receive her cousin?</p> 
<p>　　Her nearest male relative, come from Treviso purposely to visit her? Thesaints forbid!" she cried. "The poor child is indeed dying--but only tosee her cousin!" And with that she seized his hand and hurried him downthe corridor to a door on which she tapped three times. It opened atonce, and catching Odo by the shoulder she pushed him laughingly overthe threshold and cried out as she vanished: "Be careful not to agitatethe sufferer!"Odo found himself in a neat plain cell; but he had no eyes for hissurroundings. All that he saw was Fulvia, dressed in her nun's habit andseated near the window, through which the afternoon light fell softly onher white coif and the austere folds of her dress. She rose and greetedhim with a smile.</p> 
<p>　　"You are not ill, then?" he cried, stupidly, and the colour rose to herpale face.</p> 
<p>　　"No," she said, "I am not ill, and at first I was reluctant to make useof such a subterfuge; but to feign an indisposition was the only way ofspeaking with you privately, and, alas, in this school one soon becomesa proficient in deceit." She paused a moment and then added with aneffort: "Even this favour I could not have obtained save through SisterMary of the Crucifix; but she now understands that you are an old friendof my father's, and that my motive for wishing to see you is not whatshe at first supposed."This was said with such noble simplicity and so direct a glance, thatOdo, confused by the sense of his own doubts, could only murmur as hebent over her hand: "Fuoco di quest' incendio non v' assale."She drew back gently and signed him to a seat. "I trust not," she said,answering his citation; "but I think the flame through which Beatricewalked must have been less contaminating than this morass in which Iflounder."She was silent a moment and he had leisure to steal a closer look ather. It was the first time since their meeting that he had really seenher face; and he was struck by the touch of awe that had come upon herbeauty. Perhaps her recent suffering had spiritualised a countenancealready pure and lofty; for as he looked at her it seemed to him thatshe was transformed into a being beyond earthly contact, and his heartsank with the sense of her remoteness. Presently she began to speak andhis consciousness of the distance between them was increased by thecomposure of her manner. All signs of confusion and distress hadvanished. She faced him with the same innocent freedom as under herfather's roof, and all that had since passed between them seemed to haveslipped from her without a trace.</p> 
<p>　　She began by thanking him for coming, and then at once reverted to herdesperate situation and to her determination to escape.</p> 
<p>　　"I am alone and friendless," she said, "and though the length of ourpast acquaintance" (and here indeed she blushed) "scarce warrants such apresumption, yet I believe that in my father's name I may appeal to you.</p> 
<p>　　It may be that with the best will to help me you can discover no way ofdoing so, but at least I shall have the benefit of your advice. I nowsee," she added, again deeply blushing, but keeping her eyes on his,"the madness of my late attempt, and the depth of the abyss from whichyou rescued me. Death were indeed preferable to such chances; but I donot mean to die while life holds out a hope of liberation."As she spoke there flashed on Odo the reason of her remoteness andcomposure. He had come to her as a lover: she received him as a friend.</p> 
<p>　　His longing to aid her was inspired by passion: she saw in it only thenatural impulse of benevolence. So mortifying was the discovery that hehardly followed her words. All his thoughts were engaged in reviewingthe past; and he now saw that if, as she said, their acquaintance scarcewarranted her appealing to him as a friend, it still less justified hisaddressing her as a lover. Only once before had he spoken to her oflove, and that under circumstances which almost forbade a return to thesubject, or at least compelled an added prudence in approaching it. Onceagain he found himself the prisoner of his folly, and stood aghast atthe ingenuity of the punishment. To play the part she ascribed to himwas his only portion; and he resolved at least to play it like a man.</p> 
<p>　　With what composure he might, he assured Fulvia of his desire to serveher, and asked if she had no hope of obtaining her release from the HolySee. She answered: none, since enquiry must reveal that she was thedaughter of a man who had been prosecuted for heresy, and that after hisdeath she had devoted the small sum he had left her to the publicationof his writings. She added that his Holiness, resolved to counteract theeffects of the late Pope's leniency, had greatly enlarged the powers ofthe Inquisition, and had taken special measures to prevent those whoentered the religious life from renouncing their calling.</p> 
<p>　　"Since I have been here," she said, "three nuns have tried to obtaintheir release, and one has conclusively proved that she was forced totake the vows by fraud; but their pleas have been rejected, and minewould meet the same fate. Indeed, the only result would be to deprive meof what little liberty I am allowed; for the three nuns I speak of arenow the most closely watched in the convent."She went on to explain that, thanks to the connivance of Sister Mary ofthe Crucifix, her actual escape might be effected without muchdifficulty; but that she was now awake to the madness of taking sodesperate a step without knowing whither it would lead her.</p> 
<p>　　"To be safe," she said, "I must cross the borders of Switzerland. If Icould reach Geneva I should be beyond the arm of the Holy Office, and atthe University there I should find friends of my father who would surelytake pity on my situation and help me to a living. But the journey islong and difficult, and not to be safely attempted without someassurance of shelter on the way."It was on Odo's lips to declare that he would provide her with shelterand escort; but at this moment three warning taps announced the returnof Sister Mary of the Crucifix.</p> 
<p>　　She entered merrily and at once laid one hand on Fulvia's brow andcaught her wrist in the other. "The patient's pulse has risen," shedeclared, "and rest and a lowering treatment are essential. I must askthe cavaliere to withdraw."Fulvia, with an air of constraint, held out her hand to Odo.</p> 
<p>　　"I shall see you soon again?" he whispered; and Sister Mary, as thoughshe had guessed his words, cried out, "I think your excellency may counton a recurrence of the seizure two days hence at the same hour!"</p>
