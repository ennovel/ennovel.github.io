<p>　　Cantapresto, mottled and shamefaced, with his bands awry and an air oftottering dignity, was gathering their possessions together, and thepretty girl who had pillowed Odo's slumbers now knelt by his bed andlaughingly drew on his stockings. She was a slim brown morsel, not muchabove his age, with a glance that flitted like a bird, and roundshoulders slipping out of her kerchief. A wave of shyness bathed Odo tothe forehead as their eyes met: he hung his head stupidly and turnedaway when she fetched the comb to dress his hair.</p> 
<p>　　His toilet completed, she called out to the abate to go below and seethat the cavaliere's chocolate was ready; and as the door closed sheturned and kissed Odo on the lips.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, how red you are!" she cried laughing. "Is that the first kissyou've ever had? Then you'll remember me when you're Duke ofPianura--Mirandolina of Chioggia, the first girl you ever kissed!" Shewas pulling his collar straight while she talked, so that he could notget away from her. "You will remember me, won't you?" she persisted. "Ishall be a great actress by that time, and you'll appoint me primaamorosa to the ducal theatre of Pianura, and throw me a diamond braceletfrom your Highness's box and make all the court ladies ready to poisonme for rage!" She released his collar and dropped away from him. "Ah,no, I shall be a poor strolling player, and you a great prince," shesighed, "and you'll never, never think of me again; but I shall alwaysremember that I was the first girl you ever kissed!"She hung back in a dazzle of tears, looking so bright and tender thatOdo's bashfulness melted like a spring frost.</p> 
<p>　　"I shall never be Duke," he cried, "and I shall never forget you!" Andwith that he turned and kissed her boldly and then bolted down thestairs like a hare. And all that day he scorched and froze with thethought that perhaps she had been laughing at him.</p> 
<p>　　Cantapresto was torpid after the feast, and Odo detected in him an airof guilty constraint. The boy was glad enough to keep silence, and theyrolled on without speaking through the wide glowing landscape. Alreadythe nearness of a great city began to make itself felt. The brightchampaign was scattered over with farm-houses, their red-tiledpigeon-cots and their granges latticed with openwork terra-cottapleasantly breaking the expanse of maize and mulberry; villages layalong the banks of the canals intersecting the plain; and the hillsbeyond the Po were planted with villas and monasteries.</p> 
<p>　　All the afternoon they drove between umbrageous parks and under thewalls of terraced vineyards. It was a region of delectable shade, withglimpses here and there of gardens flashing with fountains and villaroofs decked with statues and vases; and at length, toward sunset, abend of the road brought them out on a fair-spreading city, soflourishing in buildings, so beset with smiling hills, that Odo,springing from his seat, cried out in sheer joy of the spectacle.</p> 
<p>　　They had still the suburbs to traverse; and darkness was falling whenthey entered the gates of Turin. This brought the fresh amazement ofwide lamplit streets, clean and bright as a ball-room, lined withpalaces and filled with well-dressed loungers: officers in the brilliantSardinian uniforms, fine gentlemen in French tie-wigs and narrow-sleevedcoats, merchants hurrying home from business, ecclesiastics inhigh-swung carriages, and young bloods dashing by in their curricles.</p> 
<p>　　The tables before the coffee-houses were thronged with idlers takingtheir chocolate and reading the gazettes; and here and there the archeddoorway of a palace showed some gay party supping al fresco in a gardenhung with lamps.</p> 
<p>　　The flashing of lights and the noise of the streets roused Cantapresto,who sat up with a sudden assumption of dignity.</p> 
<p>　　"Ah, cavaliere," said he, "you now see a great city, a famous city, acity aptly called 'the Paris of Italy.' Nowhere else shall you find suchwell-lit streets, such fair pavements, shops so full of Parisian wares,promenades so crowded with fine carriages and horses. What a life ayoung gentleman may lead here! The court is hospitable, society amiable,the theatres are the best-appointed in Italy."Here Cantapresto paused with a deprecating cough.</p> 
<p>　　"Only one thing is necessary," he went on, "to complete enjoyment of thefruits of this garden of Eden; and that is"--he coughedagain--"discretion. His Majesty, cavaliere, is a father to his subjects;the Church is their zealous mother; and between two such parents, andthe innumerable delegates of their authority, why, you may fancy, sir,that a man has to wear his eyes on all sides of his head. Discretion isa virtue the Church herself commends; it is natural, then, that sheshould afford her children full opportunity to practise it. And lookyou, cavaliere, it is like gymnastics: the younger you acquire it, theless effort it costs. Our Maker Himself has taught us the value ofsilence by putting us speechless into the world: if we learn to talklater we do it at our own risk! But for your own part, cavaliere--sincethe habit cannot too early be exercised--I would humbly counsel you tosay nothing to your illustrious parents of our little diversion of lastevening."The Countess Valdu lived on the upper floor of a rococo palace near thePiazza San Carlo; and here Odo, led by Cantapresto, presently foundhimself shown into an apartment where several ladies and gentlemen satat cards. His mother, detaching herself from the group, embraced himwith unusual warmth, and the old Count, more painted and perfumed thanever, hurried up with an obsequious greeting. Odo for the first timefound himself of consequence in the world; and as he was passed fromguest to guest, questioned about his journey, praised for his goodcolour and stout looks, complimented on his high prospects, andlaughingly entreated not to forget his old friends when fortune shouldadvance him to the duchy, he began to feel himself a reigning potentatealready.</p> 
<p>　　His mother, as he soon learned, had sunk into a life almost as dull andrestricted as that she had left Donnaz to escape. Count Valdu's positionat court was more ornamental than remunerative, the income from hisestates was growing annually smaller, and he was involved in costlylitigation over the sale of some entailed property. Such conditions werelittle to the Countess's humour, and the society to which her narrowmeans confined her offered few distractions to her vanity. Thefrequenters of the house were chiefly poor relations and hangers-on ofthe Count's, the parasites who in those days were glad to subsist on thecrumbs of the slenderest larder. Half-a-dozen hungry Countesses, theirlean admirers, a superannuated abate or two, and a flock of threadbareecclesiastics, made up Donna Laura's circle; and even her cicisbeo,selected in family council under the direction of her confessor, was anaustere gentleman of middle age, who collected ancient coins and wasengaged in composing an essay on the Martellian verse.</p> 
<p>　　This company, which devoted hours to the new French diversion of theparfilage, and spent the evenings in drinking lemonade and playingbasset for small stakes, found its chief topic of conversation in theonly two subjects safely discussed in Turin at that day--the doings ofthe aristocracy and of the clergy. The fashion of the Queen's headdressat the last circle, the marked manner in which his Majesty had latelydistinguished the brilliant young cavalry officer, Count Roberto diTournanches, the third marriage of the Countess Alfieri of Asti, theincredibility of the rumour that the court ladies of Versailles hadtaken to white muslin and Leghorn hats, the probable significance of theVicar-general's visit to Rome, the subject of the next sacredrepresentation to be given by the nuns of Santa Croce--such were thequestions that engaged the noble frequenters of Casa Valdu.</p> 
<p>　　This was the only society that Donna Laura saw; for she was too poor todress to her taste and too proud to show herself in public without theappointments becoming her station. Her sole distraction consisted invisits to the various shrines--the Sudario, the Consolata, the CorpusDomini--at which the feminine aristocracy offered up its devotions andimplored absolution for sins it had often no opportunity to commit: forthough fashion accorded cicisbei to the fine ladies of Turin, the Churchusually restricted their intercourse to the exchange of the mostharmless amenities.</p> 
<p>　　Meanwhile the antechamber was as full of duns as the approach to DonnaLaura's apartment at Pianura; and Odo guessed that the warmth of thematernal welcome sprang less from natural affection than from the hopeof using his expectations as a sop to her creditors. The pittance whichthe ducal treasury allowed for his education was scarce large enough tobe worth diverting to other ends; but a potential prince is a shield tothe most vulnerable fortunes. In this character Odo for the first timefound himself flattered, indulged, and made the centre of the company.</p> 
<p>　　The contrast to his life of subjection at Donnaz; the precociousinitiation into motives that tainted the very fount of filial piety; thetaste of this mingled draught of adulation and disillusionment, mighthave perverted a nature more self-centred than his. From thisperversion, and from many subsequent perils he was saved by a kind ofimaginative sympathy, a wondering joy in the mere spectacle of life,that tinged his most personal impressions with a streak of thephilosophic temper. If this trait did not save him from sorrow, it atleast lifted him above pettiness; if it could not solve the difficultiesof life it could arm him to endure them. It was the best gift of thepast from which he sprang; but it was blent with another quality, a deepmoral curiosity that ennobled his sensuous enjoyment of the outward showof life; and these elements were already tending in him, as in countlessyouths of his generation, to the formation of a new spirit, the spiritthat was to destroy one world without surviving to create another.</p> 
<p>　　Of all this none could have been less conscious than the lad justpreparing to enter on his studies at the Royal Academy of Turin. Thatinstitution, adjoining the royal palace, was a kind of nursery orforcing-house for the budding nobility of Savoy. In one division of thesumptuous building were housed his Majesty's pages, a corps of luxuriousindolent young fops; another wing accommodated the regular students ofthe Academy, sons of noblemen and gentlemen destined for the secularlife, while a third was set aside for the "forestieri" or students fromforeign countries and from the other Italian states. To this quarter OdoValsecca was allotted; though it was understood that on leaving theAcademy he was to enter the Sardinian service.</p> 
<p>　　It was customary for a young gentleman of Odo's rank to be attended atthe Academy not only by a body-servant but by a private governor orpedant, whose business it was to overlook his studies, attend himabroad, and have an eye to the society he frequented. The old Marquessof Donnaz had sent his daughter, by Odo's hand, a letter recommendingher to select her son's governor with particular care, choosing rather aperson of grave behaviour and assured morality than one of your glibink-spatterers who may know the inside of all the folios in the King'slibrary without being the better qualified for the direction of a younggentleman's conduct; and to this letter Don Gervaso appended the tersepostcript: "Your excellency is especially warned against according thisor any other position of trust to the merry-andrew who calls himself theabate Cantapresto."Donna Laura, with a shrug, handed the letter to her husband; CountValdu, adjusting his glasses, observed it was notorious that peopleliving in the depths of the country thought themselves qualified toinstruct their city relatives on all points connected with the socialusages; and the cicisbeo suggested that he could recommend an abate whowas proficient in the construction of the Martellian verse, and whowould made no extra charge for that accomplishment.</p> 
<p>　　"Charges!" the Countess cried. "There's a matter my father doesn't deignto consider. It's not enough, nowadays, to give the lads a governor, butthey must maintain their servants too, an idle gluttonous crew that preyon their pockets and get a commission off every tradesman's bill."Count Valdu lifted a deprecating hand.</p> 
<p>　　"My dear, nothing could be more offensive to his Majesty than anyattempt to reduce the way of living of the pupils of the Academy.""Of course," she shrugged-- "But who's to pay? The Duke's beggarlypittance hardly clothes him."The cicisbeo suggested that the cavaliere Odo had expectations; at whichDonna Laura flushed and turned uneasy; while the Count, part of whosemarital duty it was to intervene discreetly between his lady and herknight, now put forth the remark that the abate Cantapresto seemed ashrewd serviceable fellow.</p> 
<p>　　"Nor do I like to turn him adrift," cried the Countess instantly, "afterhe has obliged us by attending my son on his journey.""And I understand," added the Count, "that he would be glad to serve thecavaliere in any capacity you might designate.""Why not in all?" said the cicisbeo thoughtfully. "There would beundoubted advantages to the cavaliere in possessing a servant who wouldexplain the globes while powdering his hair and not be above calling hischair when he attended him to a lecture."And the upshot of it was that when Odo, a few days later, entered on hisfirst term at the Academy, he was accompanied by the abate Cantapresto,who had agreed, for a minimum of pay, to serve him faithfully in thedouble capacity of pedagogue and lacquey.</p> 
<p>　　The considerable liberty accorded the foreign students made Odo's firstyear at the Academy at once pleasanter and less profitable than had hebeen one of the regular pupils. The companions among whom he foundhimself were a set of lively undisciplined young gentlemen, chiefly fromEngland, Russia and the German principalities; all in possession of moreor less pocket-money and attended by governors either pedantic andself-engrossed or vulgarly subservient. These young sprigs, whoseambition it was to ape the dress and manners of the royal pages, led alife of dissipation barely interrupted by a few hours of attendance atthe academic classes. From the ill-effects of such surroundings Odo waspreserved by an intellectual curiosity that flung him ravening on hisstudies. It was not that he was of a bookish habit, or that the drudgeryof the classes was less irksome to him than to the other pupils; but noteven the pedantic methods then prevailing, or the distractions of hisnew life, could dull the flush of his first encounter with the past. Hisimagination took fire over the dry pages of Cornelius Nepos, glowed withthe mild pastoral warmth of the Georgics and burst into flame at thefirst hexameters of the Aeneid. He caught but a fragment of meaning hereand there, but the sumptuous imagery, the stirring names, the glimpsesinto a past where Roman senators were mingled with the gods of agold-pillared Olympus, filled his mind with a misty pageant ofimmortals. These moments of high emotion were interspersed with hours ofplodding over the Latin grammar and the textbooks of philosophy andlogic. Books were unknown ground to Cantapresto, and among masters andpupils there was not one who could help Odo to the meaning of his task,or who seemed aware that it might have a meaning. To most of the ladsabout him the purpose of the Academy was to fit young gentlemen for thearmy or the court; to give them the chance of sweating a shirt everymorning with the fencing-master and of learning to thread theintricacies of the court minuet. They modelled themselves on the dressand bearing of the pages, who were always ruffling it about thequadrangle in court dress and sword, or booted and spurred for a day'shunting at the King's chase of Stupinigi. To receive a nod or a wordfrom one of these young demigods on his way to the King's opera-box orjust back from a pleasure-party at her Majesty's villa above the Po--tohear of their tremendous exploits and thrilling escapades--seemed to putthe whole school in touch with the fine gentleman's world of intrigue,cards and duelling: the world in which ladies were subjugated, fortuneslost, adversaries run through and tradesmen ruined with thatimperturbable grace which distinguished the man of quality from theplebeian.</p> 
<p>　　Among the privileges of the foreign pupils were frequent visits to theroyal theatre; and here was to Odo a source of unimagined joys. Hissuperstitious dread of the stage (a sentiment, he soon discovered, thatnot even his mother's director shared) made his heart beat oppressivelyas he first set foot in the theatre. It was a gala night, boxes andstalls were thronged, and the audience-hall unfolded its glitteringcurves like some poisonous flower enveloping him in rich malignantfragrance. This impression was dispelled by the rising of the curtain ona scene of such Claude-like loveliness as it would have been impossibleto associate with the bug-bear tales of Donnaz or with the coarse anticsof the comedians at Chivasso. A temple girt with mysterious shade,lifting its colonnade above a sunlit harbour; and before the temple,vine-wreathed nymphs waving their thyrsi through the turns of amelodious dance--such was the vision that caught up Odo and swept himleagues away from the rouged and starred assemblage gathered in theboxes to gossip, flirt, eat ices and chocolates, and incidentally, inthe pauses of their talk, to listen for a moment to the ravishing airsof Metastasio's Achilles in Scyros.</p> 
<p>　　The distance between such performances--magic evocations of light andcolour and melody--and the gross buffoonery of the popular stage, stilltainted with the obscenities of the old commedia dell' arte, in ameasure explains the different points from which at that period thestage was viewed in Italy: a period when in such cities as Milan,Venice, Turin, actors and singers were praised to the skies and loadedwith wealth and favours, while the tatterdemalion players who set uptheir boards in the small towns at market-time or on feast-days weredespised by the people and flung like carrion into unconsecrated graves.</p> 
<p>　　The impression Odo had gathered from Don Gervaso's talk was of theprovincial stage in all its pothouse license; but here was a spectacleas lofty and harmonious as some great religious pageant. As the actiondeveloped and the beauty of the verse was borne to Odo on the lighthurrying ripples of Caldara's music he turned instinctively to share hispleasure with those about him. Cantapresto, in a new black coat andruffles, was conspicuously taking snuff from the tortoiseshell box whichthe Countess's cicisbeo had given him; but Odo saw that he took lesspleasure in the spectacle than in the fact of accompanying theheir-presumptive of Pianura to a gala performance at the royal theatre;and the lads about them were for the most part engaged either with theirown dress and appearance, or in exchanging greetings with the royalpages and the older students. A few of these sat near Odo, disdainfullysuperior in their fob-chains and queues; and as the boy glanced abouthim he met the fixed stare of one of the number, a tall youth seated athis elbow, and conspicuous, even in that modish company, for theexaggerated elegance of his dress. This young man, whose awkward bearingand long lava-hued face crowned with flamboyant hair contrasted oddlywith his finical apparel, returned Odo's look with a gaze of eagercomprehension. He too, it was clear, felt the thrill and wonder, or atleast re-lived them in the younger lad's emotion; and from that momentOdo felt himself in mute communion with his neighbour.</p> 
<p>　　The quick movement of the story--the succession of devices by which thewily Ulysses lures Achilles to throw off his disguise, while Deidamiastrives to conceal his identity; the scenic beauties of the background,shifting from sculpture-gallery to pleasance, from pleasance tobanquet-hall; the pomp and glitter of the royal train, the meltinggraces of Deidamia and her maidens; seemed, in their multiple appeal, todevelop in Odo new faculties of perception. It was his first initiationinto Italian poetry, and the numbers, now broken, harsh and passionate,now flowing into liquid sweetness, were so blent with sound and colourthat he scarce knew through which sense they reached him. Deidamia'sstrophes thrilled him like the singing-girl's kiss, and at the younghero's cry--Ma lo so ch' io sono Achille,E mi sento Achille in sen--his fists tightened and the blood hummed in his ears.</p> 
<p>　　In the scene of the banquet-hall, where the followers of Ulysses laybefore Lycomedes the offerings of the Greek chieftains, and, while theKing and Deidamia are marvelling at the jewels and the Tyrian robes,Achilles, unmindful of his disguise, bursts outAh, chi vide finora armi piu belle?</p> 
<p>　　--at this supreme point Odo again turned to his neighbour. Theyexchanged another look, and at the close of the act the youth leanedforward to ask with an air of condescension: "Is this your firstacquaintance with the divine Metastasio?""I have never been in a play-house before," said Odo reddening.</p> 
<p>　　The other smiled. "You are fortunate in having so worthy an introductionto the stage. Many of our operas are merely vulgar and ridiculous; butMetastasio is a great poet." Odo nodded a breathless assent. "A greatpoet," his new acquaintance resumed, "and handling a great theme. But doyou not suffer from the silly songs that perpetually interrupt the flowof the verse? To me they are intolerable. Metastasio might have been agreat tragic dramatist if Italy would have let him. But Italy does notwant tragedies--she wishes to be sung to, danced to, made eyes at,flattered and amused! Give her anything, anything that shall help her toforget her own abasement. Panem et circenses! that is always her cry.</p> 
<p>　　And who can wonder that her sovereigns and statesmen are willing tohumour her, when even her poets stoop to play the mountebank for herdiversion?" The speaker, ruffling his locks with a hand that scatteredthe powder, turned on the brilliant audience his strange corrugatedfrown. "Fools! simpletons!" he cried, "not to see that in applauding theAchilles of Metastasio they are smiling at the allegory of their ownabasement! What are the Italians of today but men tricked out in women'sfinery, when they should be waiting full-armed to rally at the firstsignal of revolt? Oh, for the day when a poet shall arise who dares tellthem the truth, not disguised in sentimental frippery, not ending in amaudlin reconciliation of love and glory--but the whole truth, naked,cold and fatal as a patriot's blade; a poet who dares show thesebedizened courtiers they are no freer than the peasants they oppress,and tell the peasants they are entitled to the same privileges as theirmasters!" He paused and drew back with a supercilious smile. "Butdoubtless, sir," said he, "I offend you in thus arraigning your sacredcaste; for unless I mistake you belong to the race of demi-gods--theTitans whose downfall is at hand?" He swept the boxes with acontemptuous eye.</p> 
<p>　　Little of this tirade was clear to Odo; but something in the speaker'stone moved him to answer, with a quick lifting of his head: "My name isOdo Valsecca, of the Dukes of Pianura;" when, fearing he had seemed toparade his birth before one evidently of inferior station, he at onceadded with a touch of shyness: "And you, sir, are perhaps a poet, sinceyou speak so beautifully?"At which, with a stare and a straightening of his long awkward body, theother haughtily returned: "A poet, sir? I am the Count Vittorio Alfieriof Asti."</p>
