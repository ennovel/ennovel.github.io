Life moved languidly in the strait-laced city, even to a younggentleman a-tiptoe for adventure and framed to elicit it as thehazel-wand draws water. Not that vulgar distractions were lacking. Thetown, as Cantapresto had long since advised him, had its secretleniencies, its posterns opening on clandestine pleasure; but there wasthat in Odo which early turned him from such cheap counterfeits ofliving. He accepted the diversions of his age, but with a clear sense oftheir worth; and the youth who calls his pleasures by their true namehas learned the secret of resisting them.</p> 
<p>　　Alfieri's coming set deeper springs in motion. His follies andextravagances were on a less provincial scale than those of Odo's dailyassociates. The breath of a freer life clung to him and his allusionswere so many glimpses into a larger world. His political theories werebut the enlargement of his private grievances, but the mere play ofcriticism on accepted institutions was an exercise more novel andexhilirating than the wildest ride on one of his half-tamedthorough-breds. Still chiefly a man of pleasure, and the slave, asalways, of some rash infatuation, Alfieri was already shaking off theintellectual torpor of his youth; and the first stirrings of hiscuriosity roused an answering passion in Odo. Their tastes were indeeddivergent, for to that external beauty which was to Odo the very bloomof life, Alfieri remained insensible; while of its imaginativecounterpart, its prolongation in the realm of thought and emotion, hehad but the most limited conception. But his love of ringing deeds wokethe chivalrous strain in Odo, and his vague celebration of Liberty, thatunknown goddess to whom altars were everywhere building, chimed with theother's scorn of oppression and injustice. So far, it is true, theircompanionship had been mainly one of pleasure; but the temper of bothgave their follies that provisional character which saves them fromvulgarity.</p> 
<p>　　Odo, who had slept late on the morning after his friend's return, waswaked by the pompous mouthing of certain lines just then on every lip inItaly:--Meet was it that, its ancient seats forsaking,An Empire should set forth with dauntless sail,And braving tempests and the deep's betrayal,Break down the barriers of inviolate worlds--That Cortez and Pizarro should esteemThe blood of man a trivial sacrificeWhen, flinging down from their ancestral thronesIncas and Mexicans of royal line,They wrecked two kingdoms to refresh thy palate--They were the verses in which the abate Parini, in his satire of TheMorning, apostrophizes the cup of chocolate which the lacquey presentsto his master. Cantapresto had in fact just entered with a cup of thisbeverage, and Alfieri, who stood at his friend's bedside with unpowderedlocks and a fashionable undress of Parisian cut, snatching the tray fromthe soprano's hands presented it to Odo in an attitude of mockservility.</p> 
<p>　　The young man sprang up laughing. It was the fashion to applaud Parini'sverse in the circles at which his satire was aimed, and none recited hismock heroics with greater zest than the young gentlemen whose fopperieshe ridiculed. Odo's toilet was indeed a rite almost as elaborate as thatof Parini's hero; and this accomplished, he was on his way to fulfil thevery duty the poet most unsparingly derides: the morning visit of thecicisbeo to his lady; but meanwhile he liked to show himself above thefollies of his class by joining in the laugh against them. When heissued from the powder-room in his gold-laced uniform, with scentedgloves and carefully-adjusted queue, he presented the image of a younggentleman so clearly equal to the most flattering emergencies thatAlfieri broke into a smile of half-ironical approval. "I see, my dearcavaliere, that it were idle to invite you to try one of the new Arabs Ihave brought with me from Spain, since it is plain other duties engageyou; but I come to lay claim to your evening."Odo hesitated. "The Queen holds a circle this evening," he said.</p> 
<p>　　"And her lady-in-waiting is in attendance?" returned Alfieri. "And thelady-in-waiting's gentleman-in-waiting also?"Odo made an impatient movement. "What inducements do you offer?" said hecarelessly.</p> 
<p>　　Alfieri stepped close and tapped him on the sleeve. "Meet me at teno'clock at the turn of the lane behind the Corpus Domini. Wear a cloakand a mask, and leave this gentleman at home with a flask of Asti." Heglanced at Cantapresto.</p> 
<p>　　Odo hesitated a moment. He knew well enough where such midnight turningsled, and across the vision evoked by his friend's words a girl's faceflitted suddenly.</p> 
<p>　　"Is that all?" he said with a shrug. "You find me, I fear, in no humourfor such exploits."Alfieri smiled. "And if I say that I have promised to bring you?""Promised--?""To one as chary of exacting such pledges as I of giving them. If I saythat you stake your life on the adventure, and that the stake is not toogreat for the reward--?"His sallow face had reddened with excitement, and Odo's foreheadreflected the flush. Was it possible--? But the thought set him tinglingwith disgust.</p> 
<p>　　"Why, you say little," he cried lightly, "at the rate at which I valuemy life."Alfieri turned on him. "If your life is worthless; make it worthsomething!" he exclaimed. "I offer you the opportunity tonight.""What opportunity?""The sight of a face that men have laid down their lives to see."Odo laughed and buckled on his sword. "If you answer for the risk, Iagree to take it," said he. "At ten o'clock then, behind the CorpusDomini."If the ladies whom gallant gentlemen delight to serve could guess whatsecret touchstones of worth these same gentlemen sometimes carry intothe adored presence, many a handsome head would be carried with lessassurance, and many a fond exaction less confidently imposed. If, forinstance, the Countess Clarice di Tournanches, whose high-coloured imagereflected itself so complacently in her Venetian toilet-glass, couldhave known that the Cavaliere Odo Valsecca's devoted glance saw herthrough the medium of a countenance compared to which her own revealedthe most unexpected shortcomings, she might have received him with lessairy petulance of manner. But how could so accomplished a mistress doubtthe permanence of her rule? The Countess Clarice, in singling out youngOdo Valsecca (to the despair of a score of more experienced cavaliers)had done him an honour that she could no more imagine his resigning thanan adventurer a throne to which he is unexpectedly raised. She was afinished example of the pretty woman who views the universe as plannedfor her convenience. What could go wrong in a world where noble ladieslived in palaces hung with tapestry and damask, with powdered lacqueysto wait on them, a turbaned blackamoor to tend their parrots andmonkeys, a coronet-coach at the door to carry them to mass or theridotto, and a handsome cicisbeo to display on the promenade? Everythinghad combined to strengthen the Countess Clarice's faith in the existingorder of things. Her husband, Count Roberto di Tournanches, was one ofthe King's equerries and distinguished for his brilliant career as anofficer of the Piedmontese army--a man marked for the highest favours ina society where military influences were paramount. Passing at sixteenfrom an aristocratic convent to the dreary magnificence of the PalazzoTournanches, Clarice had found herself a lady-in-waiting at the dullestcourt in Europe and the wife of an army officer engrossed in hisprofession, and pledged by etiquette to the service of another lady. OdoValsecca represented her escape from this bondage--the dash of romanceand folly in a life of elegant formalities; and the Countess, who wouldnot have sacrificed to him one of her rights as a court-lady or a nobildonna of the Golden Book, regarded him as the reward which Providenceaccords to a well-regulated conduct.</p> 
<p>　　Her room, when Odo entered it on taking leave of Alfieri, was crowded,as usual at that hour, with the hangers-on of the noble lady's lever:</p> 
<p>　　the abatino in lace ruffles, handing about his latest rhymed acrostic,the jeweller displaying a set of enamelled buckles newly imported fromParis, and the black-breeched doctor with white bands who concoctedremedies for the Countess's vapours and megrims. These personages,grouped about the toilet-table where the Countess sat under the hands ofa Parisian hairdresser, were picturesquely relieved against the stuccopanelling and narrow mirrors of the apartment, with its windows lookingon a garden set with mossy statues. To Odo, however, the scene suggestedthe most tedious part of his day's routine. The compliments to beexchanged, the silly verses to be praised, the gewgaws from Paris to beadmired, were all contrasted in his mind with the vision of that otherlife which had come to him on the hillside of the Superga. On this moodthe Countess Clarice's sarcasms fell without effect. To be pouted atbecause he had failed to attend the promenade of the Valentino was toOdo but a convenient pretext for excusing himself from the Queen'scircle that evening. He had engaged with little ardour to join Alfieriin what he guessed to be a sufficiently commonplace adventure; but as helistened to the Countess's chatter about the last minuet-step, and therelative merits of sanspareil water and oil-of-lilies, of gloves fromBlois and Vendome, his impatience hailed any alternative as a release.</p> 
<p>　　Meanwhile, however, long hours of servitude intervened. The lady'stoilet completed, to the adjusting of the last patch, he must attend herto dinner, where, placed at her side, he was awarded the honour ofcarving the roast; must sit through two hours of biribi in company withthe abatino, the doctor, and half-a-dozen parasites of the noble table;and for two hours more must ride in her gilt coach up and down thepromenade of the Valentino.</p> 
<p>　　Escaping from this ceremonial, with the consciousness that it must berepeated on the morrow, Odo was seized with that longing for freedomthat makes the first street-corner an invitation to flight. How heenvied Alfieri, whose travelling-carriage stood at the beck of suchmoods! Odo's scant means forbade evasion, even had his military dutiesnot kept him in Turin. He felt himself no more than a puppet dancing tothe tune of Parini's satire, a puny doll condemned, as the strings ofcustom pulled, to feign the gestures of immortal passions.</p>
