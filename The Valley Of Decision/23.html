Though Trescorre was still the Duchess's accreditedlover, it was clear that the tie between them was no longer such as tomake him resent her kindness to her young kinsman. He seemed indeedanxious to draw Odo into her Highness's circle, and surprised him by afrankness and affability of which his demeanour at Turin had given nopromise. As leader of the anti-clericals he stood for such liberalism asdared show its head in Pianura; and he seemed disposed to invite Odo'sconfidence in political matters. The latter was, however, too much thechild of his race not to hang back from such an invitation. He did notdistrust Trescorre more than the other courtiers; but it was a time whenevery ear was alert for the foot-fall of treachery, and the rashest mandid not care to taste first of any cup that was offered him.</p> 
<p>　　These scruples Trescorre made it his business to dispel. He was the onlyperson at court who was willing to discuss politics, and his clear viewof affairs excited Odo's admiration if not his concurrence. Odo's was infact one of those dual visions which instinctively see both sides of acase and take the defence of the less popular. Gamba's principles weredear to him; but he did not therefore believe in the personal basenessof every opponent of the cause. He had refrained from mentioning thehunchback to his supposed brother; but the latter, in one of theirtalks, brought forward Gamba's name, without reference to therelationship, but with high praise for the young librarian's parts.</p> 
<p>　　This, at the moment, put Odo on his guard; but Trescorre having one daybegged him to give Gamba warning of some petty danger that threatenedhim from the clerical side, it became difficult not to believe in aninterest so attested; the more so as Trescorre let it be seen thatGamba's political views were not such as to distract from his sympathy.</p> 
<p>　　"The fellow's brains," said he, "would be of infinite use to me; butperhaps he serves us best at a distance. All I ask is that he shall notrisk himself too near Father Ignazio's talons, for he would be a prettymorsel to throw to the Holy Office, and the weak point of such a man'sposition is that, however dangerous in life, he can threaten no one fromthe grave."Odo reported this to Gamba, who heard with a two-edged smile. "Yes," washis comment, "he fears me enough to want to see me safe in his fold."Odo flushed at the implication. "And why not?" said he. "Could you notserve the cause better by attaching yourself openly to the liberals thanby lurking in the ditch to throw mud at both parties?""The liberals!" sneered Gamba. "Where are they? And what have they done?</p> 
<p>　　It was they who drove out the Jesuits; but to whom did the Society'slands go? To the Duke, every acre of them! And the peasantry sufferedfar less under the fathers, who were good agriculturists, than under theDuke, who is too busy with monks and astrologers to give his mind toirrigation or the reclaiming of waste land. As to the University, whoreplaced the Jesuits there? Professors from Padua or Pavia? Heavenforbid! But holy Barnabites that have scarce Latin enough to spell outthe Lives of the Saints! The Jesuits at least gave a good education tothe upper classes; but now the young noblemen are as ignorant aspeasants."Trescorre received at his house, besides the court functionaries, allthe liberal faction and the Duchess's personal friends. He kept a lavishstate, but lacking the Bishop's social gifts, was less successful infusing the different elements of his circle. The Duke, for the first fewweeks after his kinsman's arrival, received no company; and did not evenappear in the Belverde's drawing-rooms; but Odo deemed it none the lesspolitic to show himself there without delay.</p> 
<p>　　The new Marchioness of Boscofolto lived in one of the finest palaces ofPianura, but prodigality was the least of her failings, and themeagreness of her hospitality was an unfailing source of epigram to thedrawing-rooms of the opposition. True, she kept open table for half theclergy in the town (omitting, of course, those worldly ecclesiastics whofrequented the episcopal palace), but it was whispered that she hadpersuaded her cook to take half wages in return for the privilege ofvictualling such holy men, and that the same argument enabled her toobtain her provisions below the market price. In her outer ante-chamberthe servants yawned dismally over a cold brazier, without so much as agame of cards to divert them, and the long enfilade of saloons leadingto her drawing-room was so scantily lit that her guests could scarcerecognise each other in passing. In the room where she sat, a tallcrucifix of ebony and gold stood at her elbow and a holy-water cupencrusted with jewels hung on the wall at her side. A dozen or moreecclesiastics were always gathered in stiff seats about the hearth; andthe aspect of the apartment, and the Marchioness's semi-monasticcostume, justified the nickname of "the sacristy," which the Duchess hadbestowed on her rival's drawing-room.</p> 
<p>　　Around the small fire on this cheerless hearth the fortunes of the statewere discussed and directed, benefices disposed of, court appointmentsdebated, and reputations made and unmade in tones that suggested the lowdrone of a group of canons intoning the psalter in an empty cathedral.</p> 
<p>　　The Marchioness, who appeared as eager as the others to win Odo to herparty, received him with every mark of consideration and pressed him toaccompany her on a visit to her brother, the Abbot of the Barnabites; aninvitation which he accepted with the more readiness as he had notforgotten the part played by that religious in the adventure ofMirandolina of Chioggia.</p> 
<p>　　He found the Abbot a man with a bland intriguing eye and centuries ofpious leisure in his voice. He received his visitors in a room hung withsmoky pictures of the Spanish school, showing Saint Jerome in thewilderness, the death of Saint Peter Martyr, and other sanguinarypassages in the lives of the saints; and Odo, seated among suchsurroundings, and hearing the Abbot deplore the loose lives andreligious negligence of certain members of the court, could scarcerepress a smile as the thought of Mirandolina flitted through his mind.</p> 
<p>　　"She must," he reflected, "have found this a sad change from theBishop's palace;" and admired with what philosophy she had passed fromone protector to the other.</p> 
<p>　　Life in Pianura, after the first few weeks, seemed on the whole a tamebusiness to a youth of his appetite; and he secretly longed for apretext to resume his travels. None, however, seemed likely to offer;for it was clear that the Duke, in the interval of more pressingconcerns, wished to study and observe his kinsman. When sufficientlyrecovered from the effects of the pilgrimage, he sent for Odo andquestioned him closely as to the way in which he had spent his timesince coming to Pianura, the acquaintances he had formed and thechurches he had frequented. Odo prudently dwelt on the lofty tone of theBelverde's circle, and on the privilege he had enjoyed in attending heron a visit to the holy Abbot of the Barnabites; touching more lightly onhis connection with the Bishop, and omitting all mention of Gamba andCrescenti. The Duke assumed a listening air, but it was clear that hecould not put off his private thoughts long enough to give an open mindto other matters; and Odo felt that he was nowhere so secure as in hiscousin's company. He remembered, however, that the Duke had plenty ofeyes to replace his own, and that a secret which was safe in his actualpresence might be in mortal danger on his threshold.</p> 
<p>　　His Highness on this occasion was pleased to inform his kinsman that hehad ordered Count Trescorre to place at the young man's disposal anincome enabling him to keep a carriage and pair, four saddle-horses andfive servants. It was scant measure for an heir-presumptive, and Odowondered if the Belverde had had a hand in the apportionment; but hisindifference to such matters (for though personally fastidious he caredlittle for display) enabled him to show such gratitude that the Duke,fancying he might have been content with less, had nearly withdrawn twoof the saddle-horses. This becoming behaviour greatly advanced the youngman in the esteem of his Highness, who accorded him on the spot thepetites entrees of the ducal apartments. It was a privilege Odo had nomind to abuse; for if life moved slowly in the Belverde's circle it wasat a standstill in the Duke's. His Highness never went abroad but toserve mass in some church (his almost daily practice) or to visit one ofthe numerous monasteries within the city. From Ash Wednesday to EasterMonday it was his custom to transact no public or private business.</p> 
<p>　　During this time he received none of his ministers, and saw his son butfor a few moments once a day; while in Holy Week he made a retreat withthe Barnabites, the Belverde withdrawing for the same period to theconvent of the Perpetual Adoration.</p> 
<p>　　Odo, as his new life took shape, found his chief interest in the societyof Crescenti and Gamba. In the Duchess's company he might have lost alltaste for soberer pleasures, but that his political sympathies wore agirl's reproachful shape. Ever at his side, more vividly than in thebody, Fulvia Vivaldi became the symbol of his best aims and deepestfailure. Sometimes, indeed, her look drove him forth in the Duchess'strain, but more often, drawing him from the crowd of pleasure-seekers,beckoned the way to solitude and study. Under Crescenti's tuition hebegan the reading of Dante, who just then, after generations of neglect,was once more lifting his voice above the crowd of minor singers. Themighty verse swept Odo out to open seas of thought, and from his visionof that earlier Italy, hapless, bleeding, but alive and breast to breastwith the foe, he drew the presage of his country's resurrection.</p> 
<p>　　Passing from this high music to the company of Gamba and his friends waslike leaving a church where the penitential psalms are being sung forthe market-place where mud and eggs are flying. The change was notagreeable to a fastidious taste; but, as Gamba said, you cannot cleanout a stable by waving incense over it. After some hesitation, he hadagreed to make Odo acquainted with those who, like himself, weresecretly working in the cause of progress. These were mostly of themiddle class, physicians, lawyers, and such men of letters as couldsubsist on the scant wants of an unliterary town. Ablest among them wasthe bookseller, Andreoni, whose shop was the meeting place of all theliterati of Pianura. Andreoni, famous throughout Italy for his editionsof the classics, was a man of liberal views and considerable learning,and in his private room were to be found many prohibited volumes, suchas Beccaria's Crime and Punishment, Gravina's Hydra Mystica, Concini'sHistory of Probabilism and the Amsterdam editions of the Frenchphilosophical works.</p> 
<p>　　The reformers met at various places, and their meetings were conductedwith as much secrecy as those of the Honey-Bees. Odo was at firstsurprised that they should admit him to their conferences; but he soondivined that the gatherings he attended were not those at which theprivate designs of the party were discussed. It was plain that theybelonged to some kind of secret association; and before he had been longin Pianura he learned that the society of the Illuminati, that bugbearof priests and princes, was supposed to have agents at work in theduchy. Odo had heard little of this execrated league, but that it wassaid to preach atheism, tyrannicide and the complete abolition ofterritorial rights; but this, being the report of the enemy, was to bereceived with a measure of doubt. He tried to learn from Gamba whetherthe Illuminati had a lodge in the city; but on this point he couldextract no information. Meanwhile he listened with interest todiscussions on taxation, irrigation, and such economic problems as mightsafely be aired in his presence.</p> 
<p>　　These talks brought vividly before him the political corruption of thestate and the misery of the unprivileged classes. All the land in theduchy was farmed on the metayer system, and with such ill results thatthe peasants were always in debt to their landlords. The weight of theevil lay chiefly on the country-people, who had to pay on every pig theykilled, on all the produce they carried to market, on their farmimplements, their mulberry-orchards and their silk-worms, to say nothingof the tithes to the parish. So oppressive were these obligations thatmany of the peasants, forsaking their farms, enrolled themselves in themendicant orders, thus actually strengthening the hand of theiroppressors. Of legislative redress there was no hope, and the Duke wasinaccessible to all but his favourites. The previous year, as Odolearned, eight hundred poor labourers, exasperated by want, hadpetitioned his Highness to relieve them of the corvee; but though theyhad raised fifteen hundred scudi to bribe the court official who was topresent their address, no reply had ever been received. In the cityitself, the monopoly of corn and tobacco weighed heavily on themerchants, and the strict censorship of the press made the openventilation of wrongs impossible, while the Duke's sbirri and the agentsof the Holy Office could drag a man's thoughts from his bosom and searchhis midnight dreams. The Church party, in the interest of their order,fostered the Duke's fears of sedition and branded every innovator as anatheist; the Holy Office having even cast grave doubts on the orthodoxyof a nobleman who had tried to introduce the English system of ploughingon his estates. It was evident to Odo that the secret hopes of thereformers centred in him, and the consciousness of their belief wassweeter than love in his bosom. It diverted him from the follies of hisclass, fixed his thoughts at an age when they are apt to range, and thusslowly shaped and tempered him for high uses.</p> 
<p>　　In this fashion the weeks passed and summer came. It was the Duchess'shabit to escape the August heats by retiring to the dower-house on thePiana, a league beyond the gates; but the little prince being stillunder the care of the German physician, who would not consent to hisremoval, her Highness reluctantly lingered in Pianura. With the firstleafing of the oaks Odo's old love for the budding earth awoke, and herode out daily in the forest toward Pontesordo. It was but a flatstretch of shade, lacking the voice of streams and the cold breath ofmountain-gorges: a wood without humours or surprises; but the merespring of the turf was delightful as he cantered down the grass alleysroofed with level boughs, the outer sunlight just gilding the lip of thelong green tunnel.</p> 
<p>　　Sometimes he attended the Duchess, but oftener chose to ride alone,setting forth early after a night at cards or a late vigil inCrescenti's study. One of these solitary rides brought him withoutpremeditation to a low building on the fenny edge of the wood. It was asmall house, added, it appeared, to an ancient brick front adorned withpilasters, perhaps a fragment of some woodland temple. The door-step wasovergrown with a stealthy green moss and tufted with giant fennel; and ashutter swinging loose on its hinge gave a glimpse of inner dimness. Odoguessed at once that this was the hunting lodge where Cerveno had foundhis death; and as he stood looking out across the oozy secrets of themarsh, the fever seemed to hang on his steps. He turned away with ashiver; but whether it were the sullen aspect of the house, or the closeway in which the wood embraced it, the place suddenly laid a detaininghand upon him. It was as though he had reached the heart of solitude.</p> 
<p>　　Even the faint woodland noises seemed to recede from that dense circleof shade, and the marsh turned a dead eye to heaven.</p> 
<p>　　Odo tethered his horse to a bough and seated himself on the doorstep;but presently his musings were disturbed by the sound of voices, and theDuchess, attended by her gentlemen, swept by at the end of a long glade.</p> 
<p>　　He fancied she waved her hand to him; but being in no humour to join thecavalcade, he remained seated, and the riders soon passed out of sight.</p> 
<p>　　As he sat there sombre thoughts came to him, stealing up likeexhalations from the fen. He saw his life stretched out before him, fullof broken purposes and ineffectual effort. Public affairs were in soperplexed a case that consistent action seemed impossible to eitherparty, and their chief efforts were bent toward directing the choice ofa regent. It was this, rather than the possibility of his accession,which fixed the general attention on Odo, and pledged him tocircumspection. While not concealing that in economic questions hissympathies were with the liberals, he had carefully abstained frompolitical action, and had hoped, by the strict observance of hisreligious duties, to avoid the enmity of the Church party. Trescorre'sundisguised sympathy seemed the pledge of liberal support, and it couldhardly be doubted that the choice of a regent in the Church party wouldbe unpopular enough to imperil the dynasty. With Austria hovering on thehorizon the Church herself was not likely to take such risks; and thusall interests seemed to centre in Odo's appointment.</p> 
<p>　　New elements of uncertainty were, however, perpetually disturbing theprospect. Among these was Heiligenstern's growing influence over theDuke. Odo had seen little of the German physician since their firstmeeting. Hearsay had it that he was close-pressed by the spies of theHoly Office, and perhaps for this reason he remained withdrawn in theDuke's private apartments and rarely showed himself abroad. The littleprince, his patient, was as seldom seen, and the accounts of theGerman's treatment were as conflicting as the other rumours of thecourt. It was noised on all sides, however, that the Duke wasill-satisfied with the results of the pilgrimage, and resolved upon lesshallowed measures to assure his heir's recovery. Hitherto, it wasbelieved, the German had conformed to the ordinary medical treatment;but the clergy now diligently spread among the people the report thatsupernatural agencies were to be employed. This rumour caused suchgeneral agitation that it was said both parties had made secret advancesto the Duchess in the hope of inducing her to stay the scandal. ThoughMaria Clementina felt little real concern for the public welfare, herstirring temper had more than once roused her to active opposition ofthe government, and her kinship with the old Duke of Monte Alloro madeher a strong factor in the political game. Of late, however, she seemedto have wearied of this sport, throwing herself entirely into theprivate diversions of her station, and alluding with laughingindifference to her husband's necromantic researches.</p> 
<p>　　Such was the conflicting gossip of the hour; but it was in fact idle toforecast the fortunes of a state dependent on a valetudinary's whims;and rumour was driven to feed upon her own conjectures. To Odo the stateof affairs seemed a satire on his secret aspirations. In a privatestation or as a ruling prince he might have served his fellows: as aprinceling on the edge of power he was no more than the cardboard swordin a toy armoury.</p> 
<p>　　Suddenly he heard his name pronounced and starting up saw MariaClementina at his side. She rode alone, and held out her hand as heapproached.</p> 
<p>　　"I have had an accident," said she, breathing quickly. "My girth isbroke and I have lost the rest of my company."She was glowing with her quick ride, and as Odo lifted her from thesaddle her loosened hair brushed his face like a kiss. For a moment sheseemed like life's answer to the dreary riddle of his fate.</p> 
<p>　　"Ah," she sighed, leaning on him, "I am glad I found you, cousin; Ihardly knew how weary I was;" and she dropped languidly to the doorstep.</p> 
<p>　　Odo's heart was beating hard. He knew it was only the stir of the springsap in his veins, but Maria Clementina wore a look of morning brightnessthat might have made a soberer judgment blink. He turned away to examineher saddle. As he did so, he observed that her girth was not torn, butclean cut, as with sharp scissors. He glanced up in surprise, but shesat with drooping lids, her head thrown back against the lintel; andrepressing the question on his lips he busied himself with theadjustment of the saddle. When it was in place he turned to give her ahand; but she only smiled up at him through her lashes.</p> 
<p>　　"What!" said she with an air of lovely lassitude, "are you so impatientto be rid of me? I should have been so glad to linger here a little."She put her hand in his and let him lift her to her feet. "How cool andstill it is! Look at that little spring bubbling through the moss. Couldyou not fetch me a drink from it?"She tossed aside her riding-hat and pushed back the hair from her warmforehead.</p> 
<p>　　"Your Highness must not drink of the water here," said Odo, releasingher hand.</p> 
<p>　　She gave him a quick derisive glance. "Ah, true," she cried; "this isthe house to which that abandoned wretch used to lure poor Cerveno." Shedrew back to look at the lodge. "Were you ever in it?" she askedcuriously. "I should like to see how the place looks."She laid her hand on the door-latch, and to Odo's surprise it yielded toher touch. "We're in luck, I vow," she declared with a laugh. "Comecousin, let us visit the temple of romance together."The allusion to Cerveno jarred on Odo, and he followed her in silence.</p> 
<p>　　Within doors, the lodge was seen to consist of a single room, gailypainted with hunting-scenes framed in garlands of stucco. In the duskthey could just discern the outlines of carved and gilded furniture, anda Venice mirror gave back their faces like phantoms in a magic crystal.</p> 
<p>　　"This is stifling," said Odo impatiently. "Would your Highness not bebetter in the open?""No, no," she persisted. "Unbar the shutters and we shall have airenough. I love a deserted house: I have always fancied that if one camein noiselessly enough one might catch the ghosts of the people who usedto live in it."He obeyed in silence, and the green-filtered forest noon filled the roomwith a quiver of light. A chill stole upon Odo as he looked at thedust-shrouded furniture, the painted harpsichord with green mouldcreeping over its keyboard, the consoles set with empty wine flagons andgoblets of Venice glass. The place was like the abandoned corpse ofpleasure.</p> 
<p>　　But Maria Clementina laughed and clapped her hands. "This isenchanting," she cried, throwing herself into an arm-chair of threadbaredamask, "and I shall rest here while you refresh me with a glass ofLacrima Christi from one of those dusty flagons. They are empty, yousay? Never mind, for I have a flask of cordial in my saddle-bag. Fetchit, cousin, and wash these two glasses in the spring, that we may toastall the dead lovers that have drunk out of them."When Odo returned with the flask and glasses, she had brushed the dustfrom a slender table of inlaid wood, and drawn a seat near her own. Shefilled the two goblets with cordial and signed to Odo to seat himselfbeside her.</p> 
<p>　　"Why do you pull such a glum face?" she cried, leaning over to touch hisglass before she emptied hers. "Is it that you are thinking of poorCerveno? On my soul, I question if he needs your pity! He had his hourof folly, and was too gallant a gentleman not to pay the shot. For mypart I would rather drink a poisoned draught than die of thirst."The wine was rising in waves of colour over her throat and brow, andsetting her glass down she suddenly laid her ungloved hand on Odo's.</p> 
<p>　　"Cousin," she said in a low voice, "I could help you if you would letme.""Help me?" he said, only half-aware of her words in the warm surprise ofher touch.</p> 
<p>　　She drew back, but with a look that seemed to leave her hand in his.</p> 
<p>　　"Are you mad," she murmured, "or do you despise your danger?""Am I in danger?" he echoed smiling. He was thinking how easily a manmight go under in that deep blue gaze of hers. She dropped her lids asthough aware of his thought.</p> 
<p>　　"Why do you concern yourself with politics?" she went on with a new notein her voice. "Can you find no diversion more suited to your rank andage? Our court is a dull one, I own--but surely even here a man mightfind a better use for his time."Odo's self-possession returned in a flash. "I am not," cried he gaily,"in a position to dispute it at this moment;" and he leaned over torecapture her hand. To his surprise she freed herself with an affrontedair.</p> 
<p>　　"Ah," she said, "you think this a device to provoke a gallantconversation." She faced him nobly now. "Look," said she, drawing afolded paper from the breast of her riding-coat. "Have you notfrequented these houses?"Suddenly sobered, he ran his eye over the paper. It contained the datesof the meetings he had attended at the houses of Gamba's friends, withthe designation of each house. He turned pale.</p> 
<p>　　"I had no notion," said he, with a smile, "that my movements were ofinterest in such high places; but why does your Highness speak of dangerin this connection?""Because it is rumoured that the lodge of the Illuminati, which is knownto exist in Pianura, meets secretly at the houses on this list."Odo hesitated a moment. "Of that," said he, "I have no report. I amacquainted with the houses only as the residences of certain learned andreputable men, who devote their leisure to scientific studies.""Oh," she interrupted, "call them by what name you please! It is all oneto your enemies.""My enemies?" said he lightly. "And who are they?""Who are they?" she repeated impatiently. "Who are they not? Who isthere at court that has such cause to love you? The Holy Office? TheDuke's party?"Odo smiled. "I am perhaps not in the best odour with the Church party,"said he, "but Count Trescorre has shown himself my friend, and I thinkmy character is safe in his keeping. Nor will it be any news to him thatI frequent the company you name."She threw back her head with a laugh. "Boy," she cried, "you are blindereven than I fancied! Do you know why it was that the Duke summoned youto Pianura? Because he wished his party to mould you to their shape, incase the regency should fall into your hands. And what has Trescorredone? Shown himself your friend, as you say--won your confidence,encouraged you to air your liberal views, allowed you to show yourselfcontinually in the Bishop's company, and to frequent the secretassemblies of free thinkers and conspirators--and all that the Duke mayturn against you and perhaps name him regent in your stead! Believe me,cousin," she cried with a mounting urgency, "you never stood in greaterneed of a friend than now. If you continue on your present course youare undone. The Church party is resolved to hunt down the Illuminati,and both sides would rejoice to see you made the scapegoat of the HolyOffice." She sprung up and laid her hand on his arm. "What can I do toconvince you?" she said passionately. "Will you believe me if I ask youto go away--to leave Pianura on the instant?"Odo had risen also, and they faced each other in silence. There was anunmistakable meaning in her tone: a self-revelation so simple andennobling that she seemed to give herself as hostage for her words.</p> 
<p>　　"Ask me to stay, cousin--not to go," he whispered, her yielding hand inhis.</p> 
<p>　　"Ah, madman," she cried, "not to believe me NOW! But it is not too lateif you will still be guided.""I will be guided--but not away from you."She broke away, but with a glance that drew him after. "It is late nowand we must set forward," she said abruptly. "Come to me tomorrow early.</p> 
<p>　　I have much more to say to you."The words seemed to be driven out on her quick breathing, and the bloodcame and went in her cheek like a hurried messenger. She caught up herriding-hat and turned to put it on before the Venice mirror.</p> 
<p>　　Odo, stepping up behind her, looked over her shoulder to catch thereflection of her blush. Their eyes met for a laughing instant; then hedrew back deadly pale, for in the depths of the dim mirror he had seenanother face.</p> 
<p>　　The Duchess cried out and glanced behind her. "Who was it? Did you seeher?" she said trembling.</p> 
<p>　　Odo mastered himself instantly.</p> 
<p>　　"I saw nothing," he returned quietly. "What can your Highness mean?"She covered her eyes with her hands. "A girl's face," sheshuddered--"there in the mirror--behind mine--a pale face with a blacktravelling hood over it--"He gathered up her gloves and riding-whip and threw open the door of thepavilion.</p> 
<p>　　"Your Highness is weary and the air here insalubrious. Shall we notride?" he said.</p> 
<p>　　Maria Clementina heard him with a blank stare. Suddenly she rousedherself and made as though to pass out; but on the threshold shesnatched her whip from him and, turning, flung it full at the mirror.</p> 
<p>　　Her aim was good and the chiselled handle of the whip shattered theglass to fragments.</p> 
<p>　　She caught up her long skirt and stepped into the open.</p>
