<p>　　He passed a drifting and distracted day. The fear lay much upon him thatdanger threatened Gamba and his associates; yet to seek them out in thepresent conjuncture might be to play the stalking-horse to theirenemies. Moreover, he fancied the Duchess not incapable of usingpolitical rumours to further her private caprice; and scenting noimmediate danger he resolved to wait upon events.</p> 
<p>　　On rising from dinner he was surprised by a summons from the Duke. Themessage, an unusual one at that hour, was brought by a slender pale lad,not in his Highness's service, but in that of the German physicianHeiligenstern. The boy, who was said to be a Georgian rescued from theGrand Signior's galleys, and whose small oval face was as smooth as agirl's, accosted Odo in one of the remoter garden alleys with therequest to follow him at once to the Duke's apartment. Odo complied, andhis guide loitered ahead with an air of unconcern, as though not wishingto have his errand guessed. As they passed through the tapestry gallerypreceding the gentlemen's antechamber, footsteps and voices were heardwithin. Instantly the boy was by Odo's side and had drawn him into theembrasure of a window. A moment later Trescorre left the antechamber andwalked rapidly past their hiding-place. As soon as he was out of sightthe Georgian led Odo from his concealment and introduced him by aprivate way to the Duke's closet.</p> 
<p>　　His Highness was in his bed-chamber; and Odo, on being admitted, foundhim, still in dressing-gown and night-cap, kneeling with a disorderedcountenance before the ancient picture of the Last Judgment that hung onthe wall facing his bed. He seemed to have forgotten that he had askedfor his kinsman; for on the latter's entrance he started up with asuspicious glance and hastily closed the panels of the picture, which(as Odo now noticed) appeared to conceal an inner painting. Then,gathering his dressing-gown about him, he led the way to his closet andbade his visitor be seated.</p> 
<p>　　"I have," said he, speaking in a low voice, and glancing apprehensivelyabout him, "summoned you hither privately to speak on a subject whichconcerns none but ourselves.--You met no one on your way?" he broke offto enquire.</p> 
<p>　　Odo told him that Count Trescorre had passed, but without perceivinghim.</p> 
<p>　　The Duke seemed relieved. "My private actions," said he querulously,"are too jealously spied upon by my ministers. Such surveillance is anoffence to my authority, and my subjects shall learn that it will notfrighten me from my course." He straightened his bent shoulders andtried to put on the majestic look of his official effigy. "It appears,"he continued, with one of his sudden changes of manner, "that theDuchess's uncle, the Duke of Monte Alloro, has heard favourable reportsof your wit and accomplishments, and is desirous of receiving you at hiscourt." He paused, and Odo concealed his surprise behind a profound bow.</p> 
<p>　　"I own," the Duke went on, "that the invitation comes unseasonably,since I should have preferred to keep you at my side; but his Highness'sgreat age, and his close kinship to my wife, through whom the request isconveyed, make it impossible for me to refuse." The Duke again paused,as though uncertain how to proceed. At length he resumed:--"I will notconceal from you that his Highness is subject to the fantastical humoursof his age. He makes it a condition that the length of your stay shallnot be limited; but should you fail to suit his mood you may findyourself out of favour in a week. He writes of wishing to send you on aprivate mission to the court of Naples; but this may be no more than apassing whim. I see no way, however, but to let you go, and to hope fora favourable welcome for you. The Duchess is determined upon giving heruncle this pleasure, and in fact has consented in return to oblige me inan important matter." He flushed and averted his eyes. "I name this," headded with an effort, "only that her Highness may be aware that itdepends on herself whether I hold to my side of the bargain. Your papersare already prepared and you have my permission to set out at yourconvenience. Meanwhile it were well that you should keep yourpreparations private, at least till you are ready to take leave." Andwith the air of dignity he could still assume on occasion, he rose andhanded Odo his passport.</p> 
<p>　　Odo left the closet with a beating heart. It was clear that hisdeparture from Pianura was as strongly opposed by some one in highauthority as it was favoured by the Duchess; and why opposed and by whomhe could not so much as hazard a guess. In the web of court intrigues itwas difficult for the wariest to grope his way; and Odo was still new tosuch entanglements. His first sensation was one of release, of a futuresuddenly enlarged and cleared. The door was open again to opportunity,and he was of an age to greet the unexpected like a bride. Only onethought disturbed him. It was clear that Maria Clementina had paid highfor his security; and did not her sacrifice, whatever its nature,constitute a claim upon his future? In sending him to her uncle, whoseknown favourite she was, she did not let him out of her hand. If heaccepted this chance of escape he must hereafter come and go as shebade. At the thought, his bounding fancy slunk back humbled. He sawhimself as Trescorre's successor, his sovereign's official lover, takingup again, under more difficult circumstances, and without the zest ofinexperience, the dull routine of his former bondage. No, a thousandtimes no; he would fetter himself to no woman's fancy! Better find apretext for staying in Pianura, affront the Duchess by refusing her aid,risk his prospects, his life even, than bow his neck twice to the sameyoke. All her charm vanished in this vision of unwillingsubjection...Disturbed by these considerations, and anxious to composehis spirits, Odo bethought himself of taking refuge in the Bishop'scompany. Here at least the atmosphere was clear of mystery: the Bishopheld aloof from political intrigue and breathed an air untainted by theodium theologicum. Odo found his lordship seated in the cool tessellatedsaloon which contained his chiefest treasures--marble busts ranged onpedestals between the windows, the bronze Venus Callipyge, and varioustables of pietra commessa set out with vases and tazzas of antiquepattern. A knot of virtuosi gathered about one of these tables wereengaged in examining a collection of engraved gems displayed by alapidary of Florence; while others inspected a Greek manuscript whichthe Bishop had lately received from Syria. Beyond the windows, acedrario or orange-walk stretched its sunlit vista to the terrace abovethe river; and the black cassocks of one or two priests who werestrolling in the clear green shade of a pleached alley made pleasantspots of dimness in the scene.</p> 
<p>　　Even here, however, Odo was aware of a certain disquietude. The Bishop'svisitors, instead of engaging in animated disputations over hislordship's treasures, showed a disposition to walk apart, conversing inlow tones; and he himself, presently complaining of the heat, invitedOdo to accompany him to the grot beneath the terrace. In this shadedretreat, studded with shells and coral and cooled by an artificial windforced through the conchs of marble Tritons, his lordship at once beganto speak of the rumours of public disaffection.</p> 
<p>　　"As you know," said he, "my duties and tastes alike seclude me frompolitical intrigue, and the scandal of the day seldom travels beyond mykitchens. But as creaking signboards announce a storm, the hints andwhispers of my household tell me there is mischief abroad. My positionprotects me from personal risk, and my lack of ambition from politicalenmity; for it is notorious I would barter the highest honours in thestate for a Greek vase or a bronze of Herculanaeum--not to mention thefamous Venus of Giorgione, which, if report be true, his Highness hasburned at Father Ignazio's instigation. But yours, cavaliere, is a lesssheltered walk, and perhaps a friendly warning may be of service. Yet,"he added after a pause, "a warning I can scarce call it, since I knownot from what quarter the danger impends. Proximus ardet Ucalegon; butthere is no telling which way the flames may spread. I can only adviseyou that the Duke's growing infatuation for his German magician has bredthe most violent discontent among his subjects, and that both partiesappear resolved to use this disaffection to their advantage. It is saidhis Highness intends to subject the little prince to some mysterioustreatment connected with the rites of the Egyptian priesthood, of whosesecret doctrine Heiligenstern pretends to be an adept. Yesterday it wasbruited that the Duchess loudly opposed the experiment; this afternoonit is given out that she has yielded. What the result may be, none canforesee; but whichever way the storm blows, the chief danger probablythreatens those who have had any connection with the secret societiesknown to exist in the duchy."Odo listened attentively, but without betraying any great surprise; andthe Bishop, evidently reassured by his composure, suggested that, theheat of the day having declined, they should visit the new Indianpheasants in his volary.</p> 
<p>　　The Bishop's hints had not helped his listener to a decision. Odo indeedgave Cantapresto orders to prepare as privately as possible for theirdeparture; but rather to appear to be carrying out the Duke'sinstructions than with any fixed intention of so doing. How to find apretext for remaining he was yet uncertain. To disobey the Duke wasimpossible; but in the general state of tension it seemed likely enoughthat both his Highness and the Duchess might change their minds withinthe next twenty-four hours. He was reluctant to appear that evening inthe Duchess's circle; but the command was not to be evaded, and he wentthither resolved to excuse himself early.</p> 
<p>　　He found her Highness surrounded by the usual rout that attended her.</p> 
<p>　　She was herself in a mood of wild mirth, occasioned by the drolleries ofan automatic female figure which a travelling showman introduced byCantapresto had obtained leave to display at court. This lively puppetperformed with surprising skill on the harpsichord, giving the company,among other novelties, selections from the maestro Piccini's latestopera and a concerto of the German composer Gluck.</p> 
<p>　　Maria Clementina seemed at first unaware of her kinsman's presence, andhe began to hope he might avoid any private talk with her; but when theautomaton had been dismissed and the card-tables were preparing, one ofher gentlemen summoned him to her side. As usual, she was highly rougedin the French fashion, and her cold blue eyes had a light which set offthe extraordinary fairness of her skin.</p> 
<p>　　"Cousin," said she at once, "have you your papers?" Her tone was haughtyand yet eager, as though she scorned to show herself concerned, yetwould not have had him believe in her indifference. Odo bowed withoutspeaking.</p> 
<p>　　"And when do you set out?" she continued. "My good uncle is impatient toreceive you.""At the earliest moment, madam," he replied with some hesitation.</p> 
<p>　　The hesitation was not lost on her and he saw her flush through herrouge.</p> 
<p>　　"Ah," said she in a low voice, "the earliest moment is none tooearly!--Do you go tomorrow?" she persisted; but just then Trescorreadvanced toward them, and under a burst of assumed merriment sheprivately signed to Odo to withdraw.</p> 
<p>　　He was glad to make his escape, for the sense of walking among hiddenpitfalls was growing on him. That he had acquitted himself awkwardlywith the Duchess he was well aware; but Trescorre's interruption had atleast enabled him to gain time. An increasing unwillingness to leavePianura had replaced his former impatience to be gone. The reluctance todesert his friends was coupled with a boyish desire to stay and see thegame out; and behind all his other impulses lurked the instinctiveresistance to any feminine influence save one.</p> 
<p>　　The next morning he half-expected another message from the Duchess; butnone came, and he judged her to be gravely offended. Cantaprestoappeared early with the rumour that some kind of magical ceremony was tobe performed that evening in the palace; and toward noon the Georgianboy again came privately to Odo and requested him to wait on the Dukewhen his Highness rose from supper. This increased Odo's fears forGamba, Andreoni and the other reformers; yet he dared neither seek themout in person nor entrust a message to Cantapresto. As the day passed,however, he began to throw off his apprehensions. It was not the firsttime since he had come to Pianura that there had been ominous talk ofpolitical disturbances, and he knew that Gamba and his friends were notwithout means of getting under shelter. As to his own risk, he did notgive it a thought. He was not of an age or a temper to weigh personaldanger against the excitement of conflict; and as evening drew on hefound himself wondering with some impatience if after all nothingunusual would happen.</p> 
<p>　　He supped alone, and at the appointed hour proceeded to the Duke'sapartments, taking no farther precaution than to carry his passportabout him. The palace seemed deserted. Everywhere an air of apprehensionand mystery hung over the long corridors and dimly-lit antechambers. Theday had been sultry, with a low sky foreboding great heat, and not abreath of air entered at the windows. There were few persons about, butone or two beggars lurked as usual on the landings of the greatstaircase, and Odo, in passing, felt his sleeve touched by a womancowering under the marble ramp in the shadow thrown by a colossalCaesar. Looking down, he heard a voice beg for alms, and as he gave itthe woman pressed a paper into his hand and slipped away through thedarkness.</p> 
<p>　　Odo hastened on till he could assure himself of being unobserved; thenhe unfolded the paper and read these words in Gamba's hand: "Have nofear for any one's safety but your own." With a sense of relief he hidthe message and entered the Duke's antechamber.</p> 
<p>　　Here he was received by Heiligenstern's Oriental servant, who, with amute salutation, led him into a large room where the Duke's pagesusually waited. The walls of this apartment had been concealed underhangings of black silk worked with cabalistic devices. Oil-lamps set ontripods of antique design shed a faint light over the company seated atone end of the room, among whom Odo recognised the chief dignitaries ofthe court. The ladies looked pale but curious, the men for the most partindifferent or disapproving. Intense quietness prevailed, broken only bythe soft opening and closing of the door through which the guests wereadmitted. Presently the Duke and Duchess emerged from his Highness'scloset. They were followed by Prince Ferrante, supported by his governorand his dwarf, and robed in a silken dressing-gown which hung involuminous folds about his little shrunken body. Their Highnesses seatedthemselves in two armchairs in front of the court, and the little princereclined beside his mother.</p> 
<p>　　No sooner had they taken their places than Heiligenstern stepped forth,wearing a doctor's gown and a quaintly-shaped bonnet or mitre. In hislong robes and strange headdress he looked extraordinarily tall andpale, and his features had the glassy-eyed fixity of an ancient mask. Hewas followed by his two attendants, the Oriental carrying a frame-workof polished metal, not unlike a low narrow bed, which he set down in themiddle of the room; while the Georgian lad, who had exchanged hisfustanella and embroidered jacket for a flowing white robe, bore in hishands a crystal globe set in a gold stand. Having reverently placed iton a small table, the boy, at a signal from his master, drew forth aphial and dropped its contents into a bronze vat or brazier which stoodat the far end of the room. Instantly clouds of perfumed vapour filledthe air, and as these dispersed it was seen that the black hangings ofthe walls had vanished with them, and the spectators found themselvesseated in a kind of open temple through which the eye travelled downcolonnaded vistas set with statues and fountains. This magical prospectwas bathed in sunlight, and Odo observed that, though the lamps had goneout, the same brightness suffused the room and illuminated the wonderingfaces of the audience. The little prince uttered a cry of delight, andthe magician stepped forward, raising a long white wand in his hand.</p> 
<p>　　"This," said he, in measured accents, "is an evocation of the Temple ofHealth, into whose blissful precincts the wisdom of the ancients wasable to lead the sufferer who put his trust in them. This deceptiovisus, or product of rhabdomancy, easily effected by an adept of theEgyptian mysteries, is designed but to prefigure the reality whichawaits those who seek health through the ministry of the disciples ofIamblichus. It is no longer denied among men of learning that those whohave been instructed in the secret doctrine of the ancients are able, bycertain correspondences of nature, revealed only to the initiated, toact on the inanimate world about them, and on the animal economy, bymeans beyond the common capabilities of man." He paused a moment, andthen, turning with a low bow to the Duke, enquired whether his Highnessdesired the rites to proceed.</p> 
<p>　　The Duke signed his assent, and Heiligenstern, raising his wand, evokedanother volume of mist. This time it was shot through with green flames,and as the wild light subsided the room was once more revealed with itsblack hangings, and the lamps flickered into life again.</p> 
<p>　　After another pause, doubtless intended to increase the tension of thespectators, the magician bade his servant place the crystal before him.</p> 
<p>　　He then raised his hands as if in prayer, speaking in a strange chantingjargon, in which Odo detected fragments of Greek and Latin, and therecurring names of the Judaic demons and angels. As this ceasedHeiligenstern beckoned to the Georgian boy, who approached him withbowed head and reverently folded hands.</p> 
<p>　　"Your Highness," said Heiligenstern, "and this distinguished company,are doubtless familiar with the magic crystal of the ancients, in whichthe future may be deciphered by the pure in heart. This lad, whom Irescued from slavery and have bred to my service in the solemn rites ofthe priesthood of Isis, is as clear in spirit as the crystal whichstands before you. The future lies open to him in this translucentsphere and he is prepared to disclose it at your bidding."There was a moment's silence; but on the magician's repeating hisenquiry the Duke said: "Let the boy tell me what he sees."Heiligenstern at once laid his hands on his acolyte's head and murmureda few words over him; then the boy advanced and bent devoutly above thecrystal. Almost immediately the globe was seen to cloud, as thoughsuffused with milk; the cloud gradually faded and the boy began to speakin a low hesitating tone.</p> 
<p>　　"I see," he said, "I see a face...a fair face..." He faltered andglanced up almost apprehensively at Heiligenstern, whose gaze remainedimpenetrable. The boy began to tremble. "I see nothing," he said in awhisper. "There is one here purer than I...the crystal will not speakfor me in that other's presence...""Who is that other?" Heiligenstern asked.</p> 
<p>　　The boy fixed his eyes on the little prince. An excited murmur ranthrough the company and Heiligenstern again advanced to the Duke. "Willyour Highness," he asked, "permit the prince to look into the sacredsphere?"Odo saw the Duchess extend her hand impulsively toward the child; but ata signal from the Duke the little prince's chair was carried to thetable on which the crystal stood. Instantly the former phenomenon wasrepeated, the globe clouding and then clearing itself like a pool afterrain.</p> 
<p>　　"Speak, my son," said the Duke. "Tell us what the heavenly powers revealto you."The little prince continued to pore over the globe without speaking.</p> 
<p>　　Suddenly his thin face reddened and he clung more closely to hiscompanion's arm.</p> 
<p>　　"I see a beautiful place," he began, his small fluting voice rising likea bird's pipe in the stillness, "a place a thousand times more beautifulthan this...like a garden...full of golden-haired children...withbeautiful strange toys in their hands...they have wings likebirds...they ARE birds...ah! they are flying away from me...I see themno more...they vanish through the trees..." He broke off sadly.</p> 
<p>　　Heiligenstern smiled. "That, your Highness, is a vision of the prince'sown future, when, restored to health, he is able to disport himself withhis playmates in the gardens of the palace.""But they were not the gardens of the palace!" the little boy exclaimed.</p> 
<p>　　"They were much more beautiful than our gardens."Heiligenstern bowed. "They appeared so to your Highness," hedeferentially suggested, "because all the world seems more beautiful tothose who have regained their health.""Enough, my son!" exclaimed the Duchess with a shaken voice. "Why willyou weary the child?" she continued, turning to the Duke; and thelatter, with evident reluctance, signed to Heiligenstern to cover thecrystal. To the general surprise, however, Prince Ferrante pushed backthe black velvet covering which the Georgian boy was preparing to throwover it.</p> 
<p>　　"No, no," he exclaimed, in the high obstinate voice of the spoiledchild, "let me look again...let me see some more beautiful things...Ihave never seen anything so beautiful, even in my sleep!" It was theplaintive cry of the child whose happiest hours are those spent inunconsciousness.</p> 
<p>　　"Look again, then," said the Duke, "and ask the heavenly powers whatmore they have to show you."The boy gazed in silence; then he broke out: "Ah, now we are in thepalace...I see your Highness's cabinet...no, it is the bedchamber...itis night...and I see your Highness lying asleep...very still...verystill...your Highness wears the scapular received last Easter from hisHoliness...It is very dark...Oh, now a light begins to shine...wheredoes it come from? Through the door? No, there is no door on that sideof the room...It shines through the wall at the foot of the bed...ah! Isee"--his voice mounted to a cry--"The old picture at the foot of thebed...the picture with the wicked people burning in it...has opened likea door...the light is shining through it...and now a lady steps out fromthe wall behind the picture...oh, so beautiful...she has yellow hair, asyellow as my mother's...but longer...oh, much longer...she carries arose in her hand...and there are white doves flying about hershoulders...she is naked, quite naked, poor lady! but she does not seemto mind...she seems to be laughing about it...and your Highness..."The Duke started up violently. "Enough--enough!" he stammered. "Thefever is on the child...this agitation is...most pernicious...Cover thecrystal, I say!"He sank back, his forehead damp with perspiration. In an instant thecrystal had been removed, and Prince Ferrante carried back to hismother's side. The boy seemed in nowise affected by his father'scommotion. His eyes burned with excitement, and he sat up eagerly, asthough not to miss a detail of what was going forward. Maria Clementinaleaned over and clasped his hand, but he hardly noticed her. "I want tosee some more beautiful things!" he insisted.</p> 
<p>　　The Duke sat speechless, a fallen heap in his chair, and the courtierslooked at each other, their faces shifting spectrally in the faintlight, like phantom travellers waiting to be ferried across somemysterious river. At length Heiligenstern advanced and with every markof deference addressed himself to the Duke.</p> 
<p>　　"Your Highness," said he quietly, "need be under no apprehension as tothe effect produced upon the prince. The magic crystal, as your Highnessis aware, is under the protection of the blessed spirits, and itsrevelations cannot harm those who are pure-minded enough to receivethem. But the chief purpose of this assemblage was to witness thecommunication of vital force to the prince, by means of the electricalcurrent. The crystal, by revealing its secrets to the prince, hastestified to his perfect purity of mind, and thus declared him to be ina peculiarly fit state to receive what may be designated as theSacrament of the new faith."A murmur ran through the room, but Heiligenstern continued withoutwavering: "I mean thereby to describe that natural religion which, byinstructing its adepts in the use of the hidden potencies of earth andair, testifies afresh to the power of the unseen Maker of the Universe."The murmur subsided, and the Duke, regaining his voice, said with anassumption of authority: "Let the treatment begin."Heiligenstern immediately spoke a word to the Oriental, who bent overthe metal bed which had been set up in the middle of the room. As he didso the air again darkened and the figures of the magician and hisassistants were discernible only as flitting shades in the obscurity.</p> 
<p>　　Suddenly a soft pure light overflowed the room, the perfume of flowersfilled the air, and music seemed to steal out of the very walls.</p> 
<p>　　Heiligenstern whispered to the governor and between them they lifted thelittle prince from his chair and laid him gently on the bed. Themagician then leaned over the boy with a slow weaving motion of thehands.</p> 
<p>　　"If your Highness will be pleased to sleep," he said, "I promise yourHighness the most beautiful dreams."The boy smiled back at him and he continued to bend above the bed withflitting hands. Suddenly the little prince began to laugh.</p> 
<p>　　"What does your Highness feel?" the magician asked.</p> 
<p>　　"A prickling...such a soft warm prickling...as if my blood were sunshinewith motes dancing in it...or as if that sparkling wine of France wererunning all over my body.""It is an agreeable sensation, your Highness?"The boy nodded.</p> 
<p>　　"It is well with your Highness?""Very well."Heiligenstern began a loud rhythmic chant, and gradually the airdarkened, but with the mild dimness of a summer twilight, through whichsparks could be seen flickering like fire-flies about the recliningprince. The hush grew deeper; but in the stillness Odo became aware ofsome unseen influence that seemed to envelope him in waves of exquisitesensation. It was as though the vast silence of the night had pouredinto the room and, like a dark tepid sea, was lapping about his body andrising to his lips. His thoughts, dissolved into emotion, seemed towaver and float on the stillness like sea-weed on the lift of the tide.</p> 
<p>　　He stood spell-bound, lulled, yielding himself to a blissfuldissolution.</p> 
<p>　　Suddenly he became aware that the hush was too intense, too complete;and a moment later, as though stretched to the cracking-point, it burstterrifically into sound. A huge uproar shook the room, crashing throughit like a tangible mass. The sparks whirled in a menacing dance roundthe little prince's body, and, abruptly blotted, left a deeper darkness,in which the confused herding movements of startled figures wereindistinguishably merged. A flash of silence followed; then theliberated forces of the night broke in rain and thunder on the rockingwalls of the room.</p> 
<p>　　"Light--light!" some one stammered; and at the same moment a door wasflung open, admitting a burst of candle-light and a group of figures inecclesiastical dress, against which the white gown and black hood ofFather Ignazio detached themselves. The Dominican stepped toward theDuke.</p> 
<p>　　"Your Highness," said he in a tone of quiet resolution, "must pardonthis interruption; I act at the bidding of the Holy Office."Even in that moment of profound disarray the name sent a deeper shudderthrough his hearers. The Duke, who stood grasping the arms of his chair,raised his head and tried to stare down the intruders; but no one heededhis look. At a signal from the Dominican a servant had brought in a pairof candelabra, and in their commonplace light the cabalistic hangings,the magician's appliances and his fantastically-dressed attendantslooked as tawdry as the paraphernalia of a village quack. Heiligensternalone survived the test. Erect, at bay as it were, his black robefalling in hieratic folds, the white wand raised in his hands, he mighthave personified the Prince of Darkness drawn up undaunted against thehosts of the Lord. Some one had snatched the little prince from hisstretcher, and Maria Clementina, holding him to her breast, sat palelyconfronting the sorcerer. She alone seemed to measure her strengthagainst his in some mysterious conflict of the will. But meanwhile theDuke had regained his voice.</p> 
<p>　　"My father," said he, "on what information does the Holy Office act?"The Dominican drew a parchment from his breast. "On that of theInquisitor General, your Highness," he replied, handing the paper to theDuke, who unfolded it with trembling hands but was plainly unable tomaster its contents. Father Ignazio beckoned to an ecclesiastic who hadentered the room in his train.</p> 
<p>　　"This, your Highness," said he, "is the abate de Crucis of Innsbruck,who was lately commissioned by the Holy Office to enquire into thepractises and doctrine of the order of the Illuminati, that corrupt andatheistical sect which has been the cause of so much scandal among theGerman principalities. In the course of his investigations he becameaware that the order had secretly established a lodge in Pianura; andhastening hither from Rome to advise your Highness of the fact, hasdiscovered in the so-called Count Heiligenstern one of the mostnotorious apostles of the order." He turned to the priest. "Signorabate," he said, "you confirm these facts?"The abate de Crucis quietly advanced. He was a slight pale man of aboutthirty, with a thoughtful and indulgent cast of countenance.</p> 
<p>　　"In every particular," said he, bowing profoundly to the Duke, andspeaking in a low voice of singular sweetness. "It has been my duty totrack this man's career from its ignoble beginning to its infamousculmination, and I have been able to place in the hands of the HolyOffice the most complete proofs of his guilt. The so-called CountHeiligenstern is the son of a tailor in a small village of Pomerania.</p> 
<p>　　After passing through various vicissitudes with which I need not troubleyour Highness, he obtained the confidence of the notorious Dr.</p> 
<p>　　Weishaupt, the founder of the German order of the Illuminati, andtogether this precious couple have indefatigably propagated theirobscene and blasphemous doctrines. That they preach atheism andtyrannicide I need not tell your Highness; but it is less generallyknown that they have made these infamous doctrines the cloak of privatevices from which even paganism would have recoiled. The man now beforeme, among other open offences against society, is known to have seduceda young girl of noble family in Ratisbon and to have murdered her child.</p> 
<p>　　His own wife and children he long since abandoned and disowned; and theyouth yonder, whom he describes as a Georgian slave rescued from theGrand Signior's galleys, is in fact the wife of a Greek juggler ofRavenna, and has forsaken her husband to live in criminal intercoursewith an atheist and assassin."This indictment, pronounced with an absence of emotion which made eachword cut the air like the separate stroke of a lash, was followed by aprolonged silence; then one of the Duchess's ladies cried out suddenlyand burst into tears. This was the signal for a general outbreak. Theroom was filled with a confusion of voices, and among the groups surgingabout him Odo noticed a number of the Duke's sbirri making their wayquietly through the crowd. The notary of the Holy Office advanced towardHeiligenstern, who had placed himself against the wall, with one armflung about his trembling acolyte. The Duchess, her boy still claspedagainst her, remained proudly seated; but her eyes met Odo's in a glanceof terrified entreaty, and at the same instant he felt a clutch on hissleeve and heard Cantapresto's whisper.</p> 
<p>　　"Cavaliere, a boat waits at the landing below the tanners' lane. Theshortest way to it is through the gardens and your excellency will findthe gate beyond the Chinese pavilion unlocked."He had vanished before Odo could look round. The latter still wavered;but as he did so he caught Trescorre's face through the crowd. Theminister's eye was fixed on him; and the discovery was enough to makehim plunge through the narrow wake left by Cantapresto's retreat.</p> 
<p>　　Odo made his way unhindered to the ante-room, which was also thronged,ecclesiastics, servants and even beggars from the courtyard jostlingeach other in their struggle to see what was going forward. Theconfusion favoured his escape, and a moment later he was hastening downthe tapestry gallery and through the vacant corridors of the palace. Hewas familiar with half-a-dozen short-cuts across this network ofpassages; but in his bewilderment he pressed on down the great stairsand across the echoing guard-room that opened on the terrace. A drowsysentinel challenged him; and on Odo's explaining that he sought toleave, and not to enter, the palace, replied that he had his Highness'sorders to let no one out that night. For a moment Odo was at a loss;then he remembered his passport. It seemed to him an interminable timebefore the sentinel had scrutinised it by the light of a gutteringcandle, and to his surprise he found himself in a cold sweat of fear.</p> 
<p>　　The rattle of the storm simulated footsteps at his heels and he felt theblind rage of a man within shot of invisible foes.</p> 
<p>　　The passport restored, he plunged out into the night. It was pitch-blackin the gardens and the rain drove down with the guttural rush of amidsummer storm. So fierce was its fall that it seemed to suck up theearth in its black eddies, and he felt himself swept along over aheaving hissing surface, with wet boughs lashing out at him as he fled.</p> 
<p>　　From one terrace to another he dropped to lower depths of buffetingdripping darkness, till he found his hand on the gate-latch and swung tothe black lane below the wall. Thence on a run he wound to the tanners'</p> 
<p>　　quarter by the river: a district commonly as foul-tongued as it wasill-favoured, but tonight clean-purged of both evils by the vehementsweep of the storm. Here he groped his way among slippery places andpast huddled out-buildings to the piles of the wharf. The rain was nowsubdued to a noiseless vertical descent, through which he could hear thetap of the river against the piles. Scarce knowing what he fled orwhither he was flying, he let himself down the steps and found the flatof a boat's bottom underfoot. A boatman, distinguishable only as a blackbulk in the stern, steadied his descent with outstretched hand; then thebow swung round, and after a labouring stroke or two they caught thecurrent and were swept down through the rushing darkness.</p>
