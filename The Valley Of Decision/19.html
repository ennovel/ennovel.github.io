<p>　　The rooms assigned to him lay at the end of one of the wings overlookingthe gardens; and as he mounted the great stairway and walked down thecorridors with their frescoed walls and busts of Roman emperors herecalled the far-off night when he had passed through the same scenes asa frightened awe-struck child. Where he had then beheld a supernaturalfabric, peopled with divinities of bronze and marble, and glowing withlight and colour, he now saw a many-corridored palace, stately indeed,and full of a faded splendour, but dull and antiquated in comparisonwith the new-fangled elegance of the Sardinian court. Yet at every turnsome object thrilled the fibres of old association or pride of race.</p> 
<p>　　Here he traversed a gallery hung with the portraits of his line; therecaught a glimpse of the pages' antechamber through which he and hismother had been led when they waited on the Duke; and from the windowsof his closet he overlooked the alleys and terraces where he hadwandered with the hunchback.</p> 
<p>　　One of the Duke's pages came to say that his Highness would receive thecavaliere when the court rose from dinner; and finding himself with twohours on his hands, Odo determined to await his kinsman's summons in thegarden. Thither he presently repaired; and was soon, with a mournfulpleasure, retracing the paths he had first explored in such an ecstasyof wonder. The pleached walks and parterres were in all the freshness ofJune. Roses and jasmine mingled on the terrace-walls, citron-treesingeniously grafted with red and white carnations stood in Faenza jarsbefore the lemon-house, and marble nymphs and fauns peeped from thicketsof flowering camellias. A noise of childish voices presently attractedOdo, and following a tunnel of clipped limes he came out on a theatrecut in the turf and set about with statues of Apollo and the Muses. Ahandful of boys in military dress were performing a series of evolutionsin the centre of this space; and facing them stood a child of about tenyears, in a Colonel's uniform covered with orders, his hair curled andpowdered, a paste-board sword in his hand, and his frail body supportedon one side by a turbaned dwarf, and on the other by an ecclesiastic whowas evidently his governor. The child, as Odo approached, was callingout his orders to his regiment in a weak shrill voice, moving now here,now there on his booted tottering legs, as his two supporters guidedhim, and painfully trying to flourish the paper weapon that was tooheavy for his nerveless wrist. Behind this strange group stood anotherfigure, that of a tall heavy man, richly dressed, with a curiousOriental-looking order on his breast and a veiled somnolent eye which hekept fixed on the little prince.</p> 
<p>　　Odo had been about to advance and do homage to his cousin; but a signfrom the man in the background arrested him. The manoeuvres were soonover, the heir was lifted into a little gilded chariot drawn by whitegoats, his regiment formed in line and saluted him, and he disappeareddown one of the alleys with his attendants.</p> 
<p>　　This ceremony over, the tall man advanced to Odo with a bow and askedpardon for the liberty he had taken.</p> 
<p>　　"You are doubtless," said he, "his Highness's cousin, the CavaliereValsecca; and my excuse for intruding between yourself and the prince isthat I am the Duke's physician, Count Heiligenstern, and that the heiris at present undergoing a course of treatment under my care. Hishealth, as you probably know, has long been a cause of anxiety to hisillustrious parents, and when I was summoned to Pianura the College ofPhysicians had given up all hope of saving him. Since my coming,however, I flatter myself that a marked change is perceptible. My methodis that of invigorating the blood by exciting the passions most likelyto produce a generous vital ardour. Thus, by organising these juvenilemanoeuvres, I arouse the prince's martial zeal; by encouraging him tostudy the history of his ancestors, I evoke his political ambition; bycausing him to be led about the gardens on a pony, accompanied by aminiature pack of Maltese dogs in pursuit of a tame doe, I stimulate thepassion of the chase; but it is essential to my system that one emotionshould not violently counteract another, and I am therefore obliged toprotect my noble patient from the sudden intrusion of new impressions."This explanation, delivered in a sententious tone, and with a strongGerman accent, seemed to Odo no more than a learned travesty of thefamiliar and pathetic expedient of distracting a sick child by thepretence of manly diversions. He was struck, however, by the physician'saspect, and would have engaged him in talk had not one of the Duke'sgentlemen appeared with the announcement that his Highness would bepleased to receive the Cavaliere Valsecca.</p> 
<p>　　Like most dwellings of its kind in Italy, the palace of Pianuraresembled one of those shells which reveal by their outer convolutionsthe gradual development of the creature housed within. For two or threegenerations after Bracciaforte, the terrible founder of the line, hadmade himself master of the republic, his descendants had clung to theold brick fortress or rocca which the great condottiere had heldsuccessfully against the burghers' arquebuses and the battering-rams ofrival adventurers, and which still glassed its battlements in the slowwaters of the Piana beside the city wall. It was Ascanio, the firstDuke, the correspondent of Politian and Castiglione, who, finding theancestral lair too cramped for the court of a humanist prince, hadsummoned Luciano da Laurana to build a palace better fitted to hisstate. Duke Ascanio, in bronze by Verocchio, still looked up with pridefrom the palace-square at the brick and terra-cotta facade with itsfruit-wreathed arches crowned by imperial profiles; but a later princefound the small rooms and intricate passages of Laurana's structureinadequate to the pomp of an ally of Leo X., and Vignola added the stateapartments, the sculpture gallery and the libraries.</p> 
<p>　　The palace now passed for one of the wonders of Italy. The Duke's guest,the witty and learned Aretino, celebrated it in verse, his friendCardinal Bembo in prose; Correggio painted the walls of one room, GuilioRomano the ceiling of another. It seemed that magnificence could go nofarther, till the seventeenth century brought to the throne a Duke whoasked himself how a self-respecting prince could live without a theatre,a riding-school and an additional wing to lodge the ever-growing trainof court officials who had by this time replaced the feudal men-at-arms.</p> 
<p>　　He answered the question by laying an extra tax on his people andinviting to Pianura the great Roman architect Carlo Borromini, whoregretfully admitted that his illustrious patron was on the whole lessroyally housed than their Highnesses of Mantua and Parma. Within fiveyears the "cavallerizza," the theatre and the gardens flung defiance atthese aspiring potentates; and again Pianura took precedence of herrivals. The present Duke's father had expressed the most recent tendencyof the race by the erection of a chapel in the florid Jesuit style; andthe group of buildings thus chronicled in rich durable lines the varyingpassions and ambitions of three hundred years of power.</p> 
<p>　　As Odo followed his guide toward the Duke's apartments he remarked achange in the aspect of the palace. Where formerly the corridors hadbeen thronged with pages, lacqueys and gaily-dressed cavaliers andladies, only a few ecclesiastics now glided by: here a Monsignore inermine and lace rochet, attended by his chaplain and secretaries, therea cowled Dominican or a sober-looking secular priest. The Duke waslodged in the oldest portion of the palace, and Odo, who had nevervisited these apartments, looked with interest at the projectingsculptured chimney and vaulted ceiling of the pages' ante-chamber, whichhad formerly been the guardroom and was still hung with panoplies.</p> 
<p>　　Thence he was led into a gallery lined with scriptural tapestries andfurnished in the heavy style of the seventeenth century. Here he waiteda few moments, hearing the sound of conversation in the room beyond;then the door of this apartment opened, and a handsome Dominican passedout, followed by a page who invited Odo to step into the Duke's cabinet.</p> 
<p>　　This was a very small room, completely panelled in delicate wood-carvingtouched with gold. Over this panelling, regardless of the beauty of itsdesign, had been hung a mass of reliquaries and small devotionalbas-reliefs and paintings, making the room appear more like the chapelof a wonder-working saint than a prince's closet. Here again Odo foundhimself alone; but the page presently returned to say that his Highnesswas not well and begged the cavaliere to wait on him in his bed-chamber.</p> 
<p>　　The most conspicuous object in this room was a great bedstead raised ona dais. The plumed posts and sumptuous hangings of the bed gave it analtar-like air, and the Duke himself, who lay between the curtains, hiswig replaced by a nightcap, a scapular about his neck, and hisshrivelled body wrapped in a brocaded dressing-gown, looked more like arelic than a man. His heavy under-lip trembled slightly as he offeredhis hand to Odo's salute.</p> 
<p>　　"You find me, cousin," said he after a brief greeting, "much troubled bya question that has of late incessantly disturbed my rest--can the soul,after full intuition of God, be polluted by the sins of the body?" heclutched Odo's hand in his burning grasp. "Is it possible that there arehuman beings so heedless of their doom that they can go about theirearthly pleasures with this awful problem unsolved? Oh, why has not somePope decided it? Why has God left this hideous uncertainty hanging overus? You know the doctrine of Plotinus--'he who has access to God leavesthe virtues behind him as the images of the gods are left in the outertemple.' Many of the fathers believed that the Neoplatonists werepermitted to foreshadow in their teachings the revelation of Christ; buton these occult points much doubt remains, and though certain of thegreat theologians have inclined to this interpretation, there are otherswho hold that it leans to the heresy of Quietism."Odo, who had inferred in the Duke's opening words an allusion to thelittle prince's ill-health, or to some political anxiety, was at a losshow to reply to this strange appeal; but after a moment he said, "I haveheard that your Highness's director is a man of great learning anddiscrimination. Can he not help your Highness to some decision on thispoint?"The Duke glanced at him suspiciously. "Father Ignazio," said he, "is infact well-versed in theology; but there are certain doctrinesinaccessible to all but a few who have received the direct illuminationof heaven, and on this point I cannot feel that his judgment is final."He wiped the dampness from his sallow forehead and pressed the scapularto his lips. "May you never know," he cried, "the agony of a fatherwhose child is dying, of a sovereign who longs to labour for the welfareof his people, but who is racked by the thought that in giving his mindto temporal duties and domestic affections while such spiritualdifficulties are still unsolved, he may be preparing for himself aneternity of torture such as that--" and he pointed to an old andblackened picture of the Last Judgment that hung on the opposite wall.</p> 
<p>　　Odo tried to frame a soothing rejoinder; but the Duke passionatelyinterrupted him. "Alas, cousin, no rest is possible for one who hasattained the rapture of the Beatific Vision, yet who trembles lest themere mechanical indulgence of the senses may still subject him to thecommon penalty of sin! As a man who has devoted himself to the study oftheology is privileged to argue on questions forbidden to the vulgar, sosurely fasting, maceration and ecstasy must liberate the body from thebondage of prescribed morality. Shall no distinction be recognisedbetween my conduct and that of the common sot or debauchee whose soullies in blind subjection to his lower instincts? I, who have labouredearly and late to remove temptation from my people--who have punishedoffences against conduct as unsparingly as spiritual error--I, who havenot scrupled to destroy every picture in my galleries that contained anude figure or a wanton attitude--I, who have been blessed fromchildhood by tokens of divine favour and miraculous intervention--can Idoubt that I have earned the privileges of that higher state in whichthe soul is no longer responsible for the failings of the body? Andyet--and yet--what if I were mistaken?" he moaned. "What if my advisorshave deceived me? Si autem et sic impius sum, quare frustra laboravi?"And he sank back on his pillows limp as an empty glove.</p> 
<p>　　Alarmed at his disorder, Odo stood irresolute whether to call for help;but as he hesitated the Duke feebly drew from his bosom a gold keyattached to a slender Venetian chain.</p> 
<p>　　"This," said he, "unlocks the small tortoise-shell cabinet yonder. In ityou will find a phial of clear liquor, a few drops of which will restoreme. 'Tis an essence distilled by the Benedictine nuns of the PerpetualAdoration and peculiarly effective in accesses of spiritualdisturbance."Odo complied, and having poured the liquor into a glass, held it to hiscousin's lips. In a moment the Duke's eye revived and he began to speakin a weak but composed voice, with an air of dignity in singularcontrast to his previous self-abandonment. "I am," said he, "unhappilysubject to such seizures after any prolonged exertion, and aconversation I have just had with my director has left me in no fitstate to receive you. The cares of government sit heavy on one who hasscarce health enough for the duties of a private station; and were itnot for my son I should long since have withdrawn to the shelter of themonastic life." He paused and looked at Odo with a melancholy kindness.</p> 
<p>　　"In you," said he, "the native weakness of our complexion appears tohave been tempered by the blood of your mother's house, and yourcountenance gives every promise of health and vivacity."He broke off with a sigh and continued in a more authoritative tone:</p> 
<p>　　"You have learned from Count Trescorre my motive in summoning you toPianura. My son's health causes me the liveliest concern, my own issubject to such seizures as you have just witnessed. I cannot thinkthat, in this age of infidelity and disorder, God can design to deprivea Christian state of a line of sovereigns uniformly zealous in thedefence of truth; but the purposes of Heaven are inscrutable, as therecent suppression of the Society of Jesus has most strangely proved;and should our dynasty be extinguished I am consoled by the thought thatthe rule will pass to one of our house. Of this I shall have more to sayto you in future. Meanwhile your first business is to acquaint yourselfwith your new surroundings. The Duchess holds a circle this evening,where you will meet the court; but I must advise you that the personsher Highness favours with her intimacy are not those best qualified toguide and instruct a young man in your position. These you will meet atthe house of the Countess Belverde, one of the Duchess's ladies, a womanof sound judgment and scrupulous piety, who gathers about her all ourmost learned and saintly ecclesiastics. Count Trescorre will instructyou in all that becomes your position at court, and my director, FatherIgnazio, will aid you in the selection of a confessor. As to the Bishop,a most worthy and conversable prelate, to whom I would have you show alldue regard, his zeal in spiritual matters is not as great as I couldwish, and in private talk he indulges in a laxity of opinion againstwhich I cannot too emphatically warn you. Happily, however, Pianuraoffers other opportunities of edification. Father Ignazio is a man ofwide learning and inflexible doctrine, and in several of ourmonasteries, notably that of the Barnabites, you will find examples ofsanctity and wisdom such as a young man may well devoutly consider. Ourconvents also are distinguished for the severity of their rule and thespiritual privileges accorded them. The Carmelites have every reason tohope for the beatification of their aged Prioress, and among the nuns ofthe Perpetual Adoration is one who has recently received the ineffablegrace of the vulnus divinum. In the conversation of these saintly nuns,and of the holy Abbot of the Barnabites, you will find the surestsafeguard against those errors and temptations that beset your age." Heleaned back with a gesture of dismissal; but added, reddening slightly,as Odo prepared to withdraw: "You will oblige me, cousin, when you meetmy physician, Count Heiligenstern, by not touching on the matter of therestorative you have seen me take."Odo left his cousin's presence with a feeling of deep discouragement. Toa spirit aware of the new influences abroad, and fresh from contact withevils rooted in the very foundations of the existing system, there was apeculiar irony in being advised to seek guidance and instruction in thesociety of ecstatic nuns and cloistered theologians. The Duke, with hissickly soul agrope in a maze of Neoplatonism and probabilism, while hispeople groaned under unjust taxes, while knowledge and intellectualliberty languished in a kind of moral pest-house, seemed to Odo like aruler who, in time of famine, should keep the royal granaries locked andspend his days praying for the succour that his own hand might havedispensed.</p> 
<p>　　In the tapestry room one of his Highness's gentlemen waited to reconductOdo. Their way lay through the portrait gallery of which he hadpreviously caught a glimpse, and here he begged his guide to leave him.</p> 
<p>　　He felt a sudden desire to meet his unknown ancestors face to face, andto trace the tendencies which, from the grim Bracciaforte and thestately sceptical humanist of Leo's age, had mysteriously forced therace into its ever-narrowing mould. The dusky canvases, hung high intarnished escutcheoned frames, presented a continuous chronicle of theline, from Bracciaforte himself, with his predatory profile outlined bysome early Tuscan hand against the turrets of his impregnable fortress.</p> 
<p>　　Odo lingered long on this image, but it was not till he stood beneathPiero della Francesca's portrait of the first Duke that he felt thethrill of kindred instincts. In this grave face, with its sensuous mouthand melancholy speculative eyes, he recognised the mingled strain ofimpressionability and unrest that had reached such diverse issues in hiscousin and himself. The great Duke of the "Golden Age," in hisTitianesque brocade, the statuette of a naked faun at his elbow, and afaun-like smile on his own ruddy lips, represented another aspect of theancestral spirit: the rounded temperament of an age of Cyrenaicism, inwhich every moment was a ripe fruit sunned on all sides. A littlefarther on, the shadow of the Council of Trent began to fall on theducal faces, as the uniform blackness of the Spanish habit replaced thesumptuous colours of the Renaissance. Here was the persecuting Bishop,Paul IV.'s ally against the Spaniards, painted by Caravaggio in hauberkand mailed gloves, with his motto--Etiam cum gladio--surmounting theepiscopal chair; there the Duke who, after a life of hard warfare andstern piety, had resigned his office to his son and died in the"angelica vestis" of the tertiary order; and the "beatified" Duchess whohad sold her jewels to buy corn for the poor during the famine of 1670,and had worn a hair-shirt under a corset that seemed stiff enough toserve all the purposes of bodily mortification. So the file descended,the colours fading, the shadows deepening, till it reached a babyporporato of the last century, who had donned the cardinal's habit atfour, and stood rigid and a little pale in his red robes and lace, witha crucifix and a skull on the table to which the top of his berrettahardly reached.</p> 
<p>　　It seemed to Odo as he gazed on the long line of faces as though theirowners had entered one by one into a narrowing defile, where the sunrose later and set earlier on each successive traveller; and in everycountenance, from that of the first Duke to that of his own peruked andcuirassed grandfather, he discerned the same symptom of decadency: thatduality of will which, in a delicately-tempered race, is the fatal fruitof an undisturbed pre-eminence. They had ruled too long and enjoyed toomuch; and the poor creature he had just left to his dismal scruples andforebodings seemed the mere empty husk of long-exhausted passions.</p>
