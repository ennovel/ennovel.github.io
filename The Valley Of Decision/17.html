Engaged in feeding herpet monkey with sugar-plums was the young man who had given her his armin the Piazza. This gentleman, whom she introduced to Odo as her cousinand travelling companion, the Count of Castelrovinato, had the same airof tarnished elegance as his richly-laced coat and discoloured ruffles.</p> 
<p>　　He seemed, however, of a lively and obliging humour, and Mirandolinaobserved with a smile that she could give no better notion of hisamiability than by mentioning that he was known among her friends as theCavaliere Frattanto. This praise, Odo thought, seemed scarcely to thecousin's liking; but he carried it off with the philosophic remark thatit is the mortar between the bricks that holds the building together.</p> 
<p>　　"At present," said Mirandolina laughing, "he is engaged in propping up aruin; for he has fallen desperately in love with our prima amorosa, alady who lost her virtue under the Pharaohs, but whom, for his sake, Ihave been obliged to include in our little supper."This, it was clear, was merely a way of palliating the Count'sinfatuation for herself; but he took the second thrust as good-naturedlyas the first, remarking that he had been bred for an archeologist andhad never lost his taste for the antique.</p> 
<p>　　Odo's servants now appearing with a pasty of beccafichi, some bottles ofold Malaga and a tray of ices and fruits, the three seated themselves atthe table, which Mirandolina had decorated with a number of wax candlesstuck in the cut-glass bottles of the Count's dressing-case. Here theywere speedily joined by the actress's monkey and parrot, who had soonspread devastation among the dishes. While Miranda was restoring orderby boxing the monkey's ears and feeding the shrieking bird from herlips, the door opened to admit the prima amorosa, a lady whose maturecharms and mellifluous manner suggested a fine fruit preserved in syrup.</p> 
<p>　　The newcomer was clearly engrossed in captivating the Count, and thelatter amply justified his nick-name by the cynical complaisance withwhich he cleared the way for Odo by responding to her advances.</p> 
<p>　　The tete-a-tete thus established, Miranda at once began to excuseherself for the means she had taken to attract Odo's attention at thetheatre. She had heard from the innkeeper that the Duke of Pianura'scousin, the Cavaliere Valsecca, was expected that day in Vercelli; andseeing in the Piazza a young gentleman in travelling-dress and Frenchtoupet, had at once guessed him to be the distinguished stranger fromTurin. At the theatre she had been much amused by the air ofapprehension with which Odo had appeared to seek, among the dowdy orvulgar inmates of the boxes, the sender of the mysterious billet; andthe contrast between the elegant gentleman in embroidered coat andgold-hilted sword, and the sleepy bewildered little boy of the midnightfeast at Chivasso, had seized her with such comic effect that she couldnot resist a playful allusion to their former meeting. All this was setforth with so sprightly an air of mock-contrition that, had Odo felt theleast resentment, it must instantly have vanished. He was, however, inthe humour to be pleased by whatever took his mind off his own affairs,and none could be more skilled than Mirandolina in profiting by such amood.</p> 
<p>　　He pressed her to tell him something of what had befallen her since theyhad met, but she replied by questioning him about his own experiences,and on learning that he had been called to Pianura on account of theheir's ill-health she declared it was notorious that the little princehad not long to live, and that the Duke could not hope for another son.</p> 
<p>　　"The Duke's life, however," said Odo, "is as good as mine, and in truthI am far less moved by my remote hopes of the succession than by thenear prospect of visiting so many famous cities and seeing so much thatis novel and entertaining."Miranda shrugged her pretty shoulders. "Why, as to the Duke's life,"said she, "there are some that would not give a counterfeit penny forit; but indeed his Highness lives so secluded from the world, and issurrounded by persons so jealous to conceal his true condition even fromthe court, that the reports of his health are no more to be trusted thanthe other strange rumours about him. I was told in Pianura that but fourpersons are admitted to his familiarity: his confessor, his mistress,Count Trescorre, who is already comptroller of finance and will soon beprime-minister, and a strange German doctor or astrologer that is latelycome to the court. As to the Duchess, she never sees him; and were itnot for Trescorre, who has had the wit to stand well with both sides, Idoubt if she would know more of what goes on about her husband than anyscullion in the ducal kitchens."She spoke with the air of one well-acquainted with the subject, and Odo,curious to learn more, asked her how she came to have such an insightinto the intrigues of the court.</p> 
<p>　　"Why," said she, "in the oddest way imaginable--by being the guest ofhis lordship the Bishop of Pianura; and since you asked me just now totell you something of my adventures, I will, if you please, begin byrelating the occurrences that procured me this extraordinary honour. Butfirst," she added with a smile, "would it not be well to open anotherbottle of Malaga?"MIRANDOLINA'S STORY.</p> 
<p>　　You must know, she continued, when Odo had complied with her request,that soon after our parting at Chivasso the company with which I wastravelling came to grief through the dishonesty of the Harlequin, whoran away with the Capo Comico's wife, carrying with him, besides thelady, the far more irretrievable treasure of our modest earnings. Thisbrought us to destitution, and the troop was disbanded. I had nothingbut the spangled frock on my back, and thinking to make some use of mysole possession I set out as a dancer with the flute-player of thecompany, a good-natured fellow that had a performing marmozet from theIndies. We three wandered from one town to another, spreading our carpetwherever there was a fair or a cattle-market, going hungry in badseasons, and in our luckier days attaching ourselves to some band ofstrolling posture-makers or comedians.</p> 
<p>　　One day, after about a year of this life, I had the good fortune, in themarket-place of Parma, to attract the notice of a rich English noblemanwho was engaged in writing a book on the dances of the ancients. Thisgentleman, though no longer young, and afflicted with that strangeEnglish malady that obliges a man to wrap his feet in swaddling-clotheslike a new-born infant, was of a generous and paternal disposition, andoffered, if I would accompany him to Florence, to give me a home and agenteel education. I remained with him about two years, during whichtime he had me carefully instructed in music, French and the art of theneedle. In return for this, my principal duties were to perform inantique dances before the friends of my benefactor--whose name I couldnever learn to pronounce--and to read aloud to him the works of themodern historians and philosophers.</p> 
<p>　　We lived in a large palace with exceedingly high-ceilinged rooms, whichmy friend would never have warmed on account of his plethoric habit, andas I had to dance at all seasons in the light draperies worn by theclassical goddesses, I suffered terribly from chilblains and contracteda cruel cough. To this, however, I might have resigned myself; but whenI learned from a young abate who frequented the house that the books Iwas compelled to read were condemned by the Church, and could not beperused without deadly peril to the soul, I at once resolved to fly fromsuch contaminating influences. Knowing that his lordship would notconsent to my leaving him, I took the matter out of his hands byslipping out one day during the carnival, carrying with me from thataccursed house nothing but the few jewels that my benefactor hadexpressed the intention of leaving me in his will. At the nearest churchI confessed my involuntary sin in reading the prohibited books, andhaving received absolution and the sacrament, I joined my friend theabate at Cafaggiolo, whence we travelled to Modena, where he wasacquainted with a theatrical manager just then in search of a Columbine.</p> 
<p>　　My dancing and posturing at Florence had given me something of a nameamong the dilettanti, and I was at once engaged by the manager, who tookme to Venice, where I subsequently joined the company of the excellentTartaglia with whom I am now acting. Since then I have been attended bycontinued success, which I cannot but ascribe to my virtuous resolve toface poverty and distress rather than profit a moment longer by thebeneficence of an atheist.</p> 
<p>　　All this I have related to show you how the poor ignorant girl you metat Chivasso was able to acquire something of the arts and usages of goodcompany; but I will now pass on to the incident of my visit to Pianura.</p> 
<p>　　Our manager, then, had engaged some time since to give a series ofperformances at Pianura during the last carnival. The Bishop's nephew,Don Serafino, who has a pronounced taste for the theatre, had beeninstrumental in making the arrangement; but at the last moment he wroteus that, owing to the influence of the Duke's confessor, the Bishop hadbeen obliged to prohibit the appearance of women on the stage ofPianura. This was a cruel blow, as we had prepared a number of comediesin which I was to act the leading part; and Don Serafino was equallyvexed, since he did me the honour of regarding me as the chief ornamentof the company. At length it was agreed that, to overcome thedifficulty, it should be given out that the celebrated Tartaglia ofRimini would present himself at Pianura with his company of comedians,among whom was the popular favourite, Mirandolino of Chioggia, twinbrother of the Signorina Miranda Malmocco, and trained by that actressto play in all her principal parts.</p> 
<p>　　This satisfied the scruples and interests of all concerned, and soonafterward I made my first appearance in Pianura. My success was greaterthan we had foreseen; for I threw myself into the part with such zestthat every one was taken in, and even Don Serafino required the mostcategorical demonstration to convince him that I was not my own brother.</p> 
<p>　　The illusion I produced was, however, not without its inconveniences;for, among the ladies who thronged to see the young Mirandolino, wereseveral who desired a closer acquaintance with him; and one of these, asit happened, was the Duke's mistress, the Countess Belverde. You willsee the embarrassment of my situation. If I failed to respond to heradvances, her influence was sufficient to drive us from the town at theopening of a prosperous season; if I discovered my sex to her, she mightmore cruelly avenge herself by throwing the whole company into prison,to be dealt with by the Holy Office. Under these circumstances, Idecided to appeal to the Bishop, but without, of course, revealing tohim that I was, so to speak, my own sister. His lordship, who is neversorry to do the Belverde a bad turn, received me with the utmostindulgence, and declared that, to protect my innocence from the designsof this new Potiphar's wife, he would not only give me a lodging in theEpiscopal palace, but confer on me the additional protection of theminor orders. This was rather more than I had bargained for, but he thatwants the melon is a fool to refuse the rind, and I thanked the Bishopfor his kindness and allowed him to give out that, my heart having beentouched by grace, I had resolved, at the end of the season, to withdrawfrom the stage and prepare to enter the Church.</p> 
<p>　　I now fancied myself safe; for I knew the Countess could not attempt myremoval without risk of having her passion denounced to the Duke. Ispent several days very agreeably in the Episcopal palace, entertainedat his lordship's own table, and favoured with private conversationsduring which he told me many curious and interesting things about theDuke and the court, and delicately abstained from all allusion to mycoming change of vocation. The Countess, however, had not been idle. Oneday I received notice that the Holy Office disapproved of the appearanceon the stage of a young man about to enter the Church, and requested meto withdraw at once to the Barnabite monastery, where I was to remaintill I received the minor orders. Now the Abbot of the Barnabites wasthe Belverde's brother, and I saw at once that to obey his order wouldplace me in that lady's power. I again addressed myself to the Bishop,but to my despair he declared himself unable to aid me farther, sayingthat he dared not offend the Holy Office, and that he had already runconsiderable risk in protecting me from the Countess.</p> 
<p>　　I was accordingly transferred to the monastery, in spite of my ownentreaties and those of the good Tartaglia, who moved heaven and earthto save his Columbine from sequestration. You may imagine my despair. Myfear of doing Tartaglia an injury kept me from revealing my sex, and fortwenty-four hours I languished in my cell, refusing food and air, andresisting the repeated attempts of the good monks to alleviate mydistress. At length however I bethought me that the Countess would soonappear; and it flashed across me that the one person who could protectme from her was her brother. I at once sought an interview with theAbbot, who received me with great indulgence. I explained to him thatthe distress I suffered was occasioned by the loss that my sequestrationwas causing my excellent manager, and begged him to use his influence tohave me released from the monastery. The Abbot listened attentively, andafter a pause replied that there was but one person who could arrangethe matter, and that was his sister the Countess Belverde, whosewell-known piety gave her considerable influence in such matters. I nowsaw that no alternative remained but to confess the truth; and withtears of agitation I avowed my sex, and threw myself on his mercy.</p> 
<p>　　I was not disappointed in the result. The Abbot listened with thegreatest benevolence to all the details of my adventure. He laughedheartily at his sister's delusion, but said I had done right in notundeceiving her, as her dread of ridicule might have led to unpleasantreprisals. He declared that for the present he could not on any accountconsent to let me out of his protection; but he promised if I submittedmyself implicitly to his guidance, not only to preserve me from theBelverde's machinations, but to ensure my reappearing on the stagewithin two days at the latest. Knowing him to be a very powerfulpersonage I thought it best to accept these conditions, which in anycase it would have been difficult to resist; and the next day heinformed me that the Holy Office had consented to the Signorina MirandaMalmocco's appearing on the stage of Pianura during the remainder of theseason, in consideration of the financial injury caused to the managerof the company by the edifying conversion of her twin-brother.</p> 
<p>　　"In this way," the Abbot was pleased to explain, "you will be quite safefrom my sister, who is a woman of the most unexceptionable morals, andat the same time you will not expose our excellent Bishop to the chargeof having been a party to a grave infraction of ecclesiasticaldiscipline.--My only condition," he added with a truly paternal smile,"is that, after the Signorina Miranda's performance at the theatre hertwin-brother the Signor Mirandolino shall return every evening to themonastery: a condition which seems necessary to the preservation of oursecret, and which I trust you will not regard as too onerous, in view ofthe service I have been happy enough to render you."It would have ill become me to dispute the excellent ecclesiastic'swishes, and Tartaglia and the rest of the company having been sworn tosecrecy, I reappeared that very evening in one of my favourite parts,and was afterward carried back to the monastery in the most privatemanner. The Signorina Malmocco's successes soon repaired the lossoccasioned by her brother's withdrawal, and if any suspected theiridentity all were interested to conceal their suspicions.</p> 
<p>　　Thus it came about that my visit to Pianura, having begun under the roofof a Bishop, ended in a monastery of Barnabites--nor have I any cause tocomplain of the hospitality of either of my hosts...</p> 
<p>　　***Odo, charmed by the vivacity with which this artless narrative wasrelated, pressed Miranda to continue the history of her adventures. Theactress laughingly protested that she must first refresh herself withone of the ices he had so handsomely provided; and meanwhile she beggedthe Count to favour them with a song.</p> 
<p>　　This gentleman, who seemed glad of any pretext for detaching himselffrom his elderly flame, rescued Mirandolina's lute from the inquisitivefingering of the monkey, and striking a few melancholy chords, sang thefollowing words, which he said he had learned from a peasant of theAbruzzi:--Flower of the thyme!</p> 
<p>　　She draws me as your fragrance draws the bees,She draws me as the cold moon draws the seas,And summer winter-time.</p> 
<p>　　Flower of the broom!</p> 
<p>　　Like you she blossoms over dark abysses,And close to ruin bloom her sweetest kisses,And on the brink of doom.</p> 
<p>　　Flower of the rue!</p> 
<p>　　She wore you on her breast when first we met.</p> 
<p>　　I begged your blossom and I wear it yet--Flower of regret!</p> 
<p>　　The song ended, the prima amorosa, overcome by what she visibly deemedan appeal to her feelings, declared with some agitation that the hourwas late and she must withdraw. Miranda wished the actress anaffectionate goodnight and asked the Count to light her to her room,which was on the farther side of the gallery surrounding the courtyardof the inn. Castelrovinato complied with his usual air of resignation,and the door closing on the couple, Odo and Miranda found themselvesalone.</p> 
<p>　　"And now," said the good-natured girl, placing herself on the sofa andturning to her guest with a smile, "if you will take a seat at my side Iwill gladly continue the history of my adventures"...</p>
