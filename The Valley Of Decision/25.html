<p>　　Hereafter thou shalt eat me in thy bread,Drink me in all thy kisses, feel my handSteal 'twixt thy palm and Joy's, and see me standWatchful at every crossing of the ways,The insatiate lover of thy nights and days.</p> 
<p>　　It was at Naples, some two years later, that the circumstances of hisflight were recalled to Odo Valsecca by the sound of a voice which atonce mysteriously connected itself with the incidents of that wildnight.</p> 
<p>　　He was seated with a party of gentlemen in the saloon of Sir WilliamHamilton's famous villa of Posilipo, where they were sipping theambassador's iced sherbet and examining certain engraved gems andburial-urns recently taken from the excavations. The scene was such asalways appealed to Odo's fancy: the spacious room, luxuriously fittedwith carpets and curtains in the English style, and opening on aprospect of classical beauty and antique renown; in his hands the rarestspecimens of that buried art which, like some belated golden harvest,was now everywhere thrusting itself through the Neapolitan soil; andabout him men of taste and understanding, discussing the historic ormythological meaning of the objects before them, and quoting Homer orHorace in corroboration of their guesses.</p> 
<p>　　Several visitors had joined the party since Odo's entrance; and it wasfrom a group of these later arrivals that the voice had reached him. Helooked round and saw a man of refined and scholarly appearance, dresseden abbe, as was the general habit in Rome and Naples, and holding in onehand the celebrated blue vase cut in cameo which Sir William hadrecently purchased from the Barberini family.</p> 
<p>　　"These reliefs," the stranger was saying, "whether cut in the substanceitself, or afterward affixed to the glass, certainly belong to theGrecian period of cameo-work, and recall by the purity of their designthe finest carvings of Dioskorides." His beautifully-modulated Italianwas tinged by a slight foreign accent, which seemed to connect him stillmore definitely with the episode his voice recalled. Odo turned to agentleman at his side and asked the speaker's name.</p> 
<p>　　"That," was the reply, "is the abate de Crucis, a scholar andcognoscente, as you perceive, and at present attached to the householdof the Papal Nuncio."Instantly Odo beheld the tumultuous scene in the Duke's apartments, andheard the indictment of Heiligenstern falling in tranquil accents fromthe very lips which were now, in the same tone, discussing the date of aGreek cameo vase. Even in that moment of disorder he had been struck bythe voice and aspect of the agent of the Holy Office, and by a singulardistinction that seemed to set the man himself above the coil ofpassions in which his action was involved. To Odo's spontaneous yetreflective temper there was something peculiarly impressive in the kindof detachment which implies, not obtuseness or indifference, but ahigher sensitiveness disciplined by choice. Now he felt a renewed pangof regret that such qualities should be found in the service of theopposition; but the feeling was not incompatible with a wish to be morenearly acquainted with their possessor.</p> 
<p>　　The two years elapsing since Odo's departure from Pianura had widened ifthey had not lifted his outlook. If he had lost something of his earlyenthusiasm he had exchanged it for a larger experience of cities andmen, and for the self-command born of varied intercourse. He had reacheda point where he was able to survey his past dispassionately and todisentangle the threads of the intrigue in which he had so nearly losthis footing. The actual circumstances of his escape were still wrappedin mystery: he could only conjecture that the Duchess, foreseeing thecourse events would take, had planned with Cantapresto to save him inspite of himself. His nocturnal flight down the river had carried him toPonte di Po, the point where the Piana flows into the Po, the latterriver forming for a few miles the southern frontier of the duchy. Herehis passport had taken him safely past the customs-officer, andfollowing the indications of the boatman, he had found, outside themiserable village clustered about the customs, a travelling-chaise whichbrought him before the next night-fall to Monte Alloro.</p> 
<p>　　Of the real danger from which this timely retreat had removed him,Gamba's subsequent letters had brought ample proof. It was indeed mainlyagainst himself that both parties, perhaps jointly, had directed theirattack; designing to take him in the toils ostensibly prepared for theIlluminati. His evasion known, the Holy Office had contented itself withimprisoning Heiligenstern in one of the Papal fortresses near theAdriatic, while his mistress, though bred in the Greek confession, wasconfined in a convent of the Sepolte Vive and his Oriental servant sentto the Duke's galleys. As to those suspected of affiliations with theforbidden sect, fines and penances were imposed on a few of the leastconspicuous, while the chief offenders, either from motives of policy orthanks to their superior adroitness, were suffered to escape without areprimand. After this, Gamba's letters reported, the duchy had lapsedinto its former state of quiescence. Prince Ferrante had been seriouslyailing since the night of the electrical treatment, but the Pope havingsent his private physician to Pianura, the boy had rallied under thelatter's care. The Duke, as was natural, had suffered an acute relapseof piety, spending his time in expiatory pilgrimages to the variousvotive churches of the duchy, and declining to transact any publicbusiness till he should have compiled with his own hand a calendar ofthe lives of the saints, with the initial letters painted in miniature,which he designed to present to his Holiness at Easter.</p> 
<p>　　Meanwhile Odo, at Monte Alloro, found himself in surroundings sodifferent from those he had left that it seemed incredible they shouldexist in the same world. The Duke of Monte Alloro was that rare survivalof a stronger age, a cynic. In a period of sentimental optimism, offervid enthusiasms and tearful philanthropy, he represented thepleasure-loving prince of the Renaissance, crushing his people withtaxes but dazzling them with festivities; infuriating them by hisdisregard of the public welfare, but fascinating them by his good looks,his tolerance of old abuses, his ridicule of the monks, and by thecareless libertinage which had founded the fortunes of more than onemiddle-class husband and father--for the Duke always paid well for whathe appropriated. He had grown old in his pleasant sins, and these, assuch raiment will, had grown old and dingy with him; but if no longersplendid he was still splendour-loving, and drew to his court the mostbrilliant adventurers of Italy. Spite of his preference for suchcompany, he had a nobler side, the ruins of a fine but uncultivatedintelligence, and a taste for all that was young, generous and high inlooks and courage. He was at once drawn to Odo, who instinctivelyaddressed himself to these qualities, and whose conversation and mannersthrew into relief the vulgarity of the old Duke's cronies. The latterwas the shrewd enough to enjoy the contrast at the expense of hissycophants' vanity; and the cavaliere Valsecca was for a while thereigning favourite. It would have been hard to say whether his patronwas most tickled by his zeal for economic reforms, or by his faith inthe perfectibility of man. Both these articles of Odo's creed drew tearsof enjoyment from the old Duke's puffy eyes; and he was never tired ofdeclaring that only his hatred for his nephew of Pianura induced him toaccord his protection to so dangerous an enemy of society.</p> 
<p>　　Odo at first fancied that it was in response to a mere whim of theDuke's that he had been despatched to Monte Alloro; but he soonperceived that the invitation had been inspired by Maria Clementina'swish. Some three months after Odo's arrival, Cantapresto suddenlyappeared with a packet of letters from the Duchess. Among them herHighness had included a few lines to Odo, whom she briefly adjured notto return to Pianura, but to comply in all things with her uncle'sdesires. Soon after this the old Duke sent for Odo, and asked him howhis present mode of life agreed with his tastes. Odo, who had learnedthat frankness was the surest way to the Duke's favour, replied that,while nothing could be more agreeable than the circumstances of hissojourn at Monte Alloro, he must own to a wish to travel when theoccasion offered.</p> 
<p>　　"Why, this is as I fancied," replied the Duke, who held in his hand anopen letter on which Odo recognised Maria Clementina's seal. "We havealways," he continued, "spoken plainly with each other, and I will notconceal from you that it is for your best interests that you shouldremain away from Pianura for the present. The Duke, as you doubtlessdivine, is anxious for your return, and her Highness, for that veryreason, is urgent that you should prolong your absence. It is notoriousthat the Duke soon wearies of those about him, and that your best chanceof regaining his favour is to keep out of his reach and let your enemieshang themselves in the noose they have prepared for you. For my part, Iam always glad to do an ill-turn to that snivelling friar, my nephew,and the more so when I can seriously oblige a friend; and, as you haveperhaps guessed, the Duke dares not ask for your return while I show afancy for your company. But this," added he with an ironical twinkle,"is a tame place for a young man of your missionary temper, and I have amind to send you on a visit to that arch-tyrant Ferdinand of Naples, inwhose dominions a man may yet burn for heresy or be drawn and quarteredfor poaching on a nobleman's preserves. I am advised that some raretreasures have lately been taken from the excavations there and I shouldbe glad if you would oblige me by acquiring a few for my gallery. I willgive you letters to a cognoscente of my acquaintance, who will put hisexperience at the disposal of your excellent taste, and the funds atyour service will, I hope, enable you to outbid the English brigandswho, as the Romans say, would carry off the Colosseum if it wereportable."In all this Odo discerned Maria Clementina's hand, and an instinctiveresistance made him hang back upon his patron's proposal. But the onlyalternative was to return to Pianura; and every letter from Gamba urgedon him (for the very reasons the Duke had given) the duty of keeping outof reach as the surest means of saving himself and the cause to which hewas pledged. Nothing remained but a graceful acquiescence; and early thenext spring he started for Naples.</p> 
<p>　　His first impulse had been to send Cantapresto back to the Duchess. Heknew that he owed his escape me grave difficulties to the soprano'sprompt action on the night of Heiligenstern's arrest; but he was equallysure that such action might not always be as favourable to his plans. Itwas plain that Cantapresto was paid to spy on him, and that wheneverOdo's intentions clashed with those of his would-be protectors thesoprano would side with the latter. But there was something in the airof Monte Alloro which dispelled such considerations, or at leastweakened the impulse to act on them. Cantapresto as usual had attractednotice at court. His glibness and versatility amused the Duke, and toOdo he was as difficult to put off as a bad habit. He had become soaccomplished a servant that he seemed a sixth sense of his master's; andwhen the latter prepared to start on his travels Cantapresto took hisusual seat in the chaise.</p> 
<p>　　To a traveller of Odo's temper there could be few more agreeablejourneys than the one on which he was setting out, and the Duke being inno haste to have his commission executed, his messenger had full leisureto enjoy every stage of the way. He profited by this to visit several ofthe small principalities north of the Apennines before turning towardGenoa, whence he was to take ship for the South. When he left MonteAlloro the land had worn the bleached face of February, and it wasamazing to his northern-bred eyes to find himself, on the sea-coast, inthe full exuberance of summer. Seated by this halcyon shore, Genoa, inits carved and frescoed splendour, just then celebrating with thecustomary gorgeous ritual the accession of a new Doge, seemed to Odolike the richly-inlaid frame of some Renaissance "triumph." But thesplendid houses with their marble peristyles, and the painted villas intheir orange-groves along the shore, housed a dull and narrow-mindedsociety, content to amass wealth and play biribi under the eyes of theirancestral Vandykes, without any concern as to the questions agitatingthe world. A kind of fat commercial dulness, a lack of that personaldistinction which justifies magnificence, seemed to Odo the prevailingnote of the place; nor was he sorry when his packet set sail for Naples.</p> 
<p>　　Here indeed he found all the vivacity that Genoa lacked. Few citiescould at first acquaintance be more engaging to the stranger. Dull andbrown as it appeared after the rich tints of Genoa, yet so gloriouslydid sea and land embrace it, so lavishly the sun gild and the moonsilver it, that it seemed steeped in the surrounding hues of nature. Andwhat a nature to eyes subdued to the sober tints of the north! Itsspectacular quality--that studied sequence of effects ranging from thetranslucent outline of Capri and the fantastically blue mountains of thecoast, to Vesuvius lifting its torch above the plain--this prodigalresponse to fancy's claims suggested the boundless invention of somegreat scenic artist, some Olympian Veronese with sea and sky for apalette. And then the city itself, huddled between bay and mountains,and seething and bubbling like a Titan's cauldron! Here was life at itssource, not checked, directed, utilised, but gushing forthuncontrollably through every fissure of the brown walls and reekingstreets--love and hatred, mirth and folly, impudence and greed, goingnaked and unashamed as the lazzaroni on the quays. The variegatedsurface of it all was fascinating to Odo. It set free his powers ofpurely physical enjoyment, keeping all deeper sensations in abeyance.</p> 
<p>　　These, however, presently found satisfaction in that other hidden beautyof which city and plain were but the sumptuous drapery. It is hardly toomuch to say that to the trained eyes of the day the visible Napleshardly existed, so absorbed were they in the perusal of her buried past.</p> 
<p>　　The fever of excavation was on every one. No social or political problemcould find a hearing while the subject of the last coin or bas-relieffrom Pompeii or Herculanaeum remained undecided. Odo, at first an amusedspectator, gradually found himself engrossed in the fierce quarrelsraging over the date of an intaglio or the myth represented on anamphora. The intrinsic beauty of the objects, and the light they shed onone of the most brilliant phases of human history, were in factsufficient to justify the prevailing ardour; and the reconstructivehabit he had acquired from Crescenti lent a living interest to thedriest discussion between rival collectors.</p> 
<p>　　Gradually other influences reasserted themselves. At the house of SirWilliam Hamilton, then the centre of the most polished society inNaples, he met not only artists and archeologists, but men of lettersand of affairs. Among these, he was peculiarly drawn to the twodistinguished economists, the abate Galiani and the cavaliereFilangieri, in whose company he enjoyed for the first time soundlearning unhampered by pedantry. The lively Galiani proved that socialtastes and a broad wit are not incompatible with more serious interests;and Filangieri threw the charm of a graceful personality over any topiche discussed. In the latter, indeed, courtly, young and romantic, athinker whose intellectual acuteness was steeped in moral emotion, Odobeheld the type of the new chivalry, an ideal leader of the campaignagainst social injustice. Filangieri represented the extremest optimismof the day. His sense of existing abuses was only equalled by his faithin their speedy amendment. Love was to cure all evils: the love of manfor man, the effusive all-embracing sympathy of the school of theVicaire Savoyard, was to purge the emotions by tenderness and pity. InGamba, the victim of the conditions he denounced, the sense of presenthardship prevailed over the faith in future improvement; whileFilangieri's social superiority mitigated his view of the evils andmagnified the efficacy of the proposed remedies. Odo's days passedagreeably in such intercourse, or in the excitement of excursions to theruined cities; and as the court and the higher society of Naples offeredlittle to engage him, he gradually restricted himself to the smallcircle of chosen spirits gathered at the villa Hamilton. To these hefancied the abate de Crucis might prove an interesting addition; and thedesire to learn something of this problematic person induced him to quitthe villa at the moment when the abate took leave.</p> 
<p>　　They found themselves together on the threshold; and Odo, recalling tothe other the circumstances of their first meeting, proposed that theyshould dismiss their carriages and regain the city on foot. De Crucisreadily consented; and they were soon descending the hill of Posilipo.</p> 
<p>　　Here and there a turn in the road brought them to an open space whencethey commanded the bay from Procida to Sorrento, with Capri afloat inliquid gold and the long blue shadow of Vesuvius stretching like amenace toward the city. The spectacle was one of which Odo neverwearied; but today it barely diverted him from the charms of hiscompanion's talk. The abate de Crucis had that quality of repressedenthusiasm, of an intellectual sensibility tempered by self-possession,which exercises the strongest attraction over a mind not yet master ofitself. Though all he said had a personal note he seemed to withholdhimself even in the moment of greatest expansion: like some prince whoshould enrich his favourites from the public treasury but keep hisprivate fortune unimpaired. In the course of their conversation Odolearned that though of Austrian birth his companion was of mingledEnglish and Florentine parentage: a fact perhaps explaining the mixtureof urbanity and reserve that lent such charm to his manner. He told Odothat his connection with the Holy Office had been only temporary, andthat, having contracted a severe cold the previous winter in Germany, hehad accepted a secretaryship in the service of the Papal Nuncio in orderto enjoy the benefits of a mild climate. "By profession," he added, "Iam a pedagogue, and shall soon travel to Rome, where I have been calledby Prince Bracciano to act as governor to his son; and meanwhile I amtaking advantage of my residence here to indulge my taste forantiquarian studies."He went on to praise the company they had just left, declaring that heknew no better way for a young man to form his mind than by frequentingthe society of men of conflicting views and equal capacity. "Nothing,"said he, "is more injurious to the growth of character than to besecluded from argument and opposition; as nothing is healthier than tobe obliged to find good reasons for one's beliefs on pain ofsurrendering them.""But," said Odo, struck with this declaration, "to a man of your cloththere is one belief which never surrenders to reason."The other smiled. "True," he agreed; "but I often marvel to see howlittle our opponents know of that belief. The wisest of them seem in thecase of those children at our country fairs who gape at the incrediblethings depicted on the curtains of the booths, without asking themselveswhether the reality matches its presentment. The weakness of humannature has compelled us to paint the outer curtain of the sanctuary ingaudy colours, and the malicious fancy of our enemies has given amonstrous outline to these pictures; but what are such vanities to onewho has passed beyond, and beheld the beauty of the King's daughter, allglorious within?"As though unwilling to linger on such grave topics, he turned the talkto the scene at their feet, questioning Odo as to the impression Napleshad made on him. He listened courteously to the young man's comments onthe wretched state of the peasantry, the extravagances of the court andnobility and the judicial corruption which made the lower classes submitto any injustice rather than seek redress through the courts. De Crucisagreed with him in the main, admitting that the monopoly of corn, themaintenance of feudal rights and the King's indifference to the graverduties of his rank placed the kingdom of Naples far below such states asTuscany or Venetia; "though," he added, "I think our economists, inpraising one state at the expense of another, too often overlook thosedifferences of character and climate that must ever make it impossibleto govern different races in the same manner. Our peasants have a bluntsaying: Cut off the dog's tail and he is still a dog; and so I suspectthe most enlightened rule would hardly bring this prompt and cholericpeople, living on a volcanic soil amid a teeming vegetation, into anyresemblance with the clear-headed Tuscan or the gentle and dignifiedRoman."As he spoke they emerged upon the Chiaia, where at that hour the qualitytook the air in their carriages, while the lower classes thronged thefootway. A more vivacious scene no city of Europe could present. Thegilt coaches drawn by six or eight of the lively Neapolitan horses,decked with plumes and artificial flowers and preceded by runningfootmen who beat the foot-passengers aside with long staves; therichly-dressed ladies seated in this never-ending file of carriages,bejewelled like miraculous images and languidly bowing to their friends;the throngs of citizens and their wives in holiday dress; the sellers ofsherbet, ices and pastry bearing their trays and barrels through thecrowd with strange cries and the jingling of bells; the friars of everyorder in their various habits, the street-musicians, the half-nakedlazzaroni, cripples and beggars, who fringed the throng like the line ofscum edging a fair lake;--this medley of sound and colour, which in factresembled some sudden growth of the fiery soil, was an expressivecomment on the abate's words.</p> 
<p>　　"Look," he continued, as he and Odo drew aside to escape the mud from anemblazoned chariot, "at the gold-leaf on the panels of that coach andthe gold-lace on the liveries of those lacqueys. Is there any other cityin the world where gold is so prodigally used? Where the monks gildtheir relics, the nobility their servants, the apothecaries their pills,the very butchers their mutton? One might fancy their bright sun had setthem the example! And how cold and grey all soberer tints must seem tothese children of Apollo! Well--so it is with their religion and theirdaily life. I wager half those naked wretches yonder would rather attenda fine religious service, with abundance of gilt candles, music fromgilt organ-pipes, and incense from gilt censers, than eat a good meal orsleep in a decent bed; as they would rather starve under a handsomemerry King that has the name of being the best billiard-player in Europethan go full under one of your solemn reforming Austrian Archdukes!"The words recalled to Odo Crescenti's theory of the influence ofcharacter and climate on the course of history; and this subject soonengrossing both speakers, they wandered on, inattentive to theirsurroundings, till they found themselves in the thickest concourse ofthe Toledo. Here for a moment the dense crowd hemmed them in; and asthey stood observing the humours of the scene, Odo's eye fell on thethick-set figure of a man in doctor's dress, who was being led throughthe press by two agents of the Inquisition. The sight was too common tohave fixed his attention, had he not recognised with a start theirascible red-faced professor who, on his first visit to Vivaldi, haddefended the Diluvial theory of creation. The sight raised a host ofmemories from which Odo would gladly have beaten a retreat; but thecrowd held him in check and a moment later he saw that the doctor's eyeswere fixed on him with an air of recognition. A movement of pitysucceeded his first impulse, and turning to de Crucis he exclaimed:--"Isee yonder an old acquaintance who seems in an unlucky plight and withwhom I should be glad to speak."The other, following his glance, beckoned to one of the sbirri, who madehis way through the throng with the alacrity of one summoned by asuperior. De Crucis exchanged a few words with him, and then signed tohim to return to his charge, who presently vanished in some freshshifting of the crowd.</p> 
<p>　　"Your friend," said de Crucis, "has been summoned before the Holy Officeto answer a charge of heresy preferred by the authorities. He has latelybeen appointed to the chair of physical sciences in the University here,and has doubtless allowed himself to publish openly views that werebetter expounded in the closet. His offence, however, appears to be amild one, and I make no doubt he will be set free in a few days."This, however, did not satisfy Odo; and he asked de Crucis if there wereno way of speaking with the doctor at once.</p> 
<p>　　His companion hesitated. "It can easily be arranged," said he;"but--pardon me, cavaliere--are you well-advised in mixing yourself insuch matters?""I am well-advised in seeking to serve a friend!" Odo somewhat hotlyreturned; and de Crucis, with a faint smile of approval, repliedquietly: "In that case I will obtain permission for you to visit yourfriend in the morning."He was true to his word; and the next forenoon Odo, accompanied by anofficer of police, was taken to the prison of the Inquisition. Here hefound his old acquaintance seated in a clean commodious room and readingAristotle's "History of Animals," the only volume of his library that hehad been permitted to carry with him. He welcomed Odo heartily, and onthe latter's enquiring what had brought him to this plight, replied withsome dignity that he had been led there in the fulfilment of his duty.</p> 
<p>　　"Some months ago," he continued, "I was summoned hither to profess thenatural sciences in the University; a summons I readily accepted, sinceI hoped, by the study of a volcanic soil, to enlarge my knowledge of theglobe's formation. Such in fact was the case, but to my surprise myresearches led me to adopt the views I had formerly combated, and I nowfind myself in the ranks of the Vulcanists, or believers in thesecondary origin of the earth: a view you may remember I once opposedwith all the zeal of inexperience. Having firmly established every pointin my argument according to the Baconian method of investigation, I feltit my duty to enlighten my scholars; and in the course of my lastlecture I announced the result of my investigations. I was of courseaware of the inevitable result; but the servants of Truth have no choicebut to follow where she calls, and many have joyfully traversed stonierplaces than I am likely to travel."Nothing could exceed the respect with which Odo heard this simpleconfession of faith. It was as though the speaker had unconsciouslyconvicted him of remissness, of cowardice even; so vain and windy histheorising seemed, judged by the other's deliberate act! Yet placed ashe was, what could he do, how advance their common end, but by passivelywaiting on events? At least, he reflected, he could perform the trivialservice of trying to better his friend's case; and this he eagerlyoffered to attempt. The doctor thanked him, but without any greatappearance of emotion: Odo was struck by the change which hadtransformed a heady and intemperate speaker into a model of philosophiccalm. The doctor, indeed, seemed far more concerned for the safety ofhis library and his cabinet of minerals than for his own. "Happily,"said he, "I am not a man of family, and can therefore sacrifice myliberty with a clear conscience: a fact I am the more thankful for whenI recall the moral distress of our poor friend Vivaldi, when compelledto desert his post rather than be separated from his daughter."The name brought the colour to Odo's brow, and with an embarrassed airhe asked what news the doctor had of their friend.</p> 
<p>　　"Alas," said the other, "the last was of his death, which happened twoyears since in Pavia. The Sardinian government had, as you probablyknow, confiscated his small property on his leaving the state, and I amtold he died in great poverty, and in sore anxiety for his daughter'sfuture." He added that these events had taken place before his owndeparture from Turin, and that since then he had learned nothing ofFulvia's fate, save that she was said to have made her home with an auntwho lived in a town of the Veneto.</p> 
<p>　　Odo listened in silence. The lapse of time, and the absence of any linksof association, had dimmed the girl's image in his breast; but at themere sound of her name it lived again, and he felt her interwoven withhis deepest fibres. The picture of her father's death and of her ownneed filled him with an ineffectual pity, and for a moment he thought ofseeking her out; but the other could recall neither the name of the townshe had removed to nor that of the relative who had given her a home.</p> 
<p>　　To aid the good doctor was a simpler business. The intervention of deCrucis and Odo's own influence sufficed to effect his release, and onthe payment of a heavy fine (in which Odo privately assisted him) he wasreinstated in his chair. The only promise exacted by the Holy Office wasthat he should in future avoid propounding his own views on questionsalready decided by Scripture, and to this he readily agreed, since, ashe shrewdly remarked to Odo, his opinions were now well-known, and anywho wished farther instruction had only to apply to him privately.</p> 
<p>　　The old Duke having invited Odo to return to Monte Alloro with suchtreasures as he had collected for the ducal galleries, the young manresolved to visit Rome on his way to the North. His acquaintance with deCrucis had grown into something like friendship since their joint effortin behalf of the imprisoned sage, and the abate preparing to set outabout the same time, the two agreed to travel together. The road leadingfrom Naples to Rome was at that time one of the worst in Italy, and wasbesides so ill-provided with inns that there was no inducement to lingeron the way. De Crucis, however, succeeded in enlivening even thistedious journey. He was a good linguist and a sound classical scholar,besides having, as he had told Odo, a pronounced taste for antiquarianresearch. In addition to this, he performed agreeably on the violin, andwas well-acquainted with the history of music. His chief distinction,however, lay in the ease with which he wore his accomplishments, and ina breadth of view that made it possible to discuss with him manysubjects distasteful to most men of his cloth. The sceptical orlicentious ecclesiastic was common enough; but Odo had never before meta priest who united serious piety with this indulgent temper, or who hadlearning enough to do justice to the arguments of his opponents.</p> 
<p>　　On his venturing one evening to compliment de Crucis on these qualities,the latter replied with a smile: "Whatever has been lately advancedagainst the Jesuits, it can hardly be denied that they were goodschool-masters; and it is to them I owe the talents you have beenpleased to admire. Indeed," he continued, quietly fingering his violin,"I was myself bred in the order: a fact I do not often make known in thepresent heated state of public opinion, but which I never conceal whencommended for any quality that I owe to the Society rather than to myown merit."Surprise for the moment silenced Odo; for though it was known that Italywas full of former Jesuits who had been permitted to remain in thecountry as secular priests, and even to act as tutors or professors inprivate families, he had never thought of de Crucis in this connection.</p> 
<p>　　The latter, seeing his surprise, went on: "Once a Jesuit, always aJesuit, I suppose. I at least owe the Society too much not to own mydebt when the occasion offers. Nor could I ever see the force of thecharge so often brought against us: that we sacrifice everything to theglory of the order. For what is the glory of the order? Our own mottohas declared it: Ad majorem Dei gloriam--who works for the Society worksfor its Master. If our zeal has been sometimes misdirected, our bloodhas a thousand times witnessed to its sincerity. In the Indies, inAmerica, in England during the great persecution, and lately on our ownunnatural coasts, the Jesuits have died for Christ as joyfully as Hisfirst disciples died for Him. Yet these are but a small number incomparison with the countless servants of the order who, labouring infar countries among savage peoples, or surrounded by the hereticalenemies of our faith, have died the far bitterer death of moralisolation: setting themselves to their task with the knowledge thattheir lives were but so much indistinguishable dust to be added to thesum of human effort. What association founded on human interests hasever commanded such devotion? And what merely human authority couldcount on such unquestioning obedience, not in a mob of poor illiteratemonks, but in men chosen for their capacity and trained to the exerciseof their highest faculties? Yet there have never lacked such men toserve the Order; and as one of our enemies has said--our noblest enemy,the great Pascal--'je crois volontiers aux histoires dont les temoins sefont egorger.'"He did not again revert to his connection with the Jesuits; but in thefarther course of their acquaintance Odo was often struck by thefirmness with which he testified to the faith that was in him, withoutusing the jargon of piety, or seeming, by his own attitude, to cast areflection on that of others. He was indeed master of that worldlyscience which the Jesuits excelled in imparting, and which, though itmight sink to hypocrisy in smaller natures, became in a finely-temperedspirit, the very flower of Christian courtesy.</p> 
<p>　　Odo had often spoken to de Crucis of the luxurious lives led by many ofthe monastic orders in Naples. It might be true enough that the monksthemselves, and even their abbots, fared on fish and vegetables, andgave their time to charitable and educational work; but it wasimpossible to visit the famous monastery of San Martino, or that of theCarthusians at Camaldoli, without observing that the anchoret's cell hadexpanded into a delightful apartment, with bedchamber, library andprivate chapel, and his cabbage-plot into a princely garden. De Crucisadmitted the truth of the charge, explaining it in part by the characterof the Neapolitan people, and by the tendency of the northern travellerto forget that such apparent luxuries as spacious rooms, shady grovesand the like are regarded as necessities in a hot climate. He urged,moreover, that the monastic life should not be judged by a few isolatedinstances; and on the way to Rome he proposed that Odo, by way of seeingthe other side of the question, should visit the ancient foundation ofthe Benedictines on Monte Cassino.</p> 
<p>　　The venerable monastery, raised on its height over the busy vale ofGarigliano, like some contemplative spirit above the conflictingproblems of life, might well be held to represent the nobler side ofChristian celibacy. For nearly a thousand years its fortified walls hadbeen the stronghold of the humanities, and generations of students hadcherished and added to the treasures of the famous library. But theBenedictine rule was as famous for good works as for learning, and itscomparative abstention from dogmatic controversy and from the mechanicaldevotion of some of the other orders had drawn to it men of superiormind, who sought in the monastic life the free exercise of the noblestactivities rather than a sanctified refuge from action. This wasespecially true of the monastery of Monte Cassino, whither many scholarshad been attracted and where the fathers had long had the highest namefor learning and beneficence. The monastery, moreover, in addition toits charitable and educational work among the poor, maintained a schoolof theology to which students came from all parts of Italy; and theirpresence lent an unwonted life to the great labyrinth of courts andcloisters.</p> 
<p>　　The abbot, with whom de Crucis was well-acquainted, welcomed thetravellers warmly, making them free of the library and the archives andpressing them to prolong their visit. Under the spell of theseinfluences they lingered on from day to day; and to Odo they were thepleasantest days he had known. To be waked before dawn by the bellringing for lauds--to rise from the narrow bed in his white-washed cell,and opening his casement look forth over the haze-enveloped valley, thedark hills of the Abruzzi and the remote gleam of sea touched into beingby the sunrise--to hasten through hushed echoing corridors to thechurch, where in a grey resurrection-light the fathers were intoning thesolemn office of renewal--this morning ablution of the spirit, so likethe bodily plunge into clear cold water, seemed to attune the mind tothe fullest enjoyment of what was to follow: the hours of study, thetalks with the monks, the strolls through cloister or garden, allpunctuated by the recurring summons to devotion. Yet for all its latentsignificance it remained to him a purely sensuous impression, the visionof a golden leisure: not a solution of life's perplexities, but at bestan honourable escape from them.</p>
