He had been trying to break down a greatgold-barred gate, behind which Fulvia, pale and disordered, struggled inthe clutch of the blind beggar of the Corpus Domini...</p> 
<p>　　He sat up and looked about him. The gate was still there; but as hegazed it resolved itself into his shuttered window, barred with widelines of sunlight. It was day, then! He sprang out of bed and flung openthe shutters. Beneath him lay the piazza of Vercelli, bathed in thevertical brightness of a summer noon; and as he stared out on thisinexorable scene, the clock over the Hospital struck twelve.</p> 
<p>　　Twelve o'clock! And he had promised to meet Vivaldi at dawn behind theUmiliati! As the truth forced itself on Odo he dropped into a chair andhid his face with a groan. He had failed them again, then--and this timehow cruelly and basely! He felt himself the victim of a conspiracy whichin some occult manner was forever forcing him to outrage and betray thetwo beings he most longed to serve. The idea of a conspiracy flashed asudden light on his evening's diversion, and he sprang up with a cry.</p> 
<p>　　Yes! It was a plot, and any but a dolt must have traced the soprano'shand in this vulgar assault upon his senses. He choked with anger at thethought of having played the dupe when two lives he cherished werestaked upon his vigilance...</p> 
<p>　　To his furious summons Cantapresto presented a blank wall of ignorance.</p> 
<p>　　Yes, the Cavaliere had given orders that the carriage should be readybefore daybreak; but who was authorised to wake the cavaliere? Afterkeeping the carriage two hours at the door Cantapresto had ventured tosend it back to the stable; but the horses should instantly be put to,and within an hour they would be well forward on their journey.</p> 
<p>　　Meanwhile, should the barber be summoned at once? Or would the cavalierefirst refresh himself with an excellent cup of chocolate, prepared underCantapresto's own supervision?</p> 
<p>　　Odo turned on him savagely. "Traitor--spy! In whose pay--?"But the words roused him to a fresh sense of peril. Cantapresto, thoughhe might have guessed Odo's intention, was not privy to his plan ofrejoining Vivaldi and Fulvia; and it flashed across the young man thathis self-betrayal must confirm the others' suspicions. His one hope ofprotecting his friends was to affect indifference to what had happened;and this was made easier, by the reflection that Cantapresto was afterall but a tool in more powerful hands. To be spied on was so natural toan Italian of that day that the victim's instinct was rather tocircumvent the spy than to denounce him.</p> 
<p>　　Odo dismissed Cantapresto with the reply that he would give orders aboutthe carriage later; desiring that meanwhile the soprano should purchasethe handsomest set of filigree ornaments to be found in Vercelli, andcarry them with the Cavaliere Valsecca's compliments to the SignorinaMalmocco.</p> 
<p>　　Having thus rid himself of observation he dressed as rapidly aspossible, trying the while to devise some means of tracing Vivaldi. Butthe longer he pondered the attempt the more plainly he saw its futility.</p> 
<p>　　Vivaldi, doubtless from motives of prudence, had not named the friendwith whom he and Fulvia were to take shelter; nor did Odo even know inwhat quarter of the city to seek them. To question the police was torisk their last chance of safety; and for the same reason he dared notenquire of the posting-master whether any travellers had set out thatmorning for Lombardy. His natural activity of mind was hampered by aleaden sense of remissness. With what anguish of spirit must Vivaldi andFulvia have awaited him in that hour of dawn behind the convent! Whatthoughts must have visited the girl's mind as day broadened, the citywoke, and peril pressed on them with every voice and eye! And when atlength they saw that he had failed them, which way did their huntedfootsteps turn? Perhaps they dared not go back to the friend who hadtaken them in for the night. Perhaps even now they wandered through thestreets, fearing arrest if they revealed themselves by venturing toengage a carriage, at every turn of his thoughts Odo was mocked by somevision of disaster; and an hour of perplexity yielded no happierexpedient than that of repairing to the meeting-place behind theUmiliati. It was a deserted lane with few passers; and after vainlyquestioning the blank wall of the convent and the gates of asinister-looking alms-house that faced it, he retraced his steps to theinn.</p> 
<p>　　He spent a day of futile research and bitter thoughts, now strayingforth in the hope of meeting Vivaldi, now hastening back to the ThreeCrowns on the chance that some message might await him. He dared not lethis mind rest on what might have befallen his friends; yet thealternative of contemplating his own course was scarcely more endurable.</p> 
<p>　　Nightfall brought the conviction that the Professor and Fulvia hadpassed beyond his reach. It was clear that if they were still inVercelli they did not mean to make their presence known to him, while inthe event of their escape he was without means of tracing them farther.</p> 
<p>　　He knew indeed that their destination was Milan, but, should they reachthere safely, what hope was there of finding them in a city ofstrangers? By a stroke of folly he had cut himself off from allcommunication with them, and his misery was enhanced by the discovery ofhis weakness. He who had fed his fancy on high visions, cherishing inhimself the latent patriot and hero, had been driven by a girl's capriceto break the first law of manliness and honour! The event had alreadyjustified her; and in a flash of self-contempt he saw himself as she nodoubt beheld him--the fribble preying like a summer insect on the slowgrowths of difficult years...</p> 
<p>　　In bitterness of spirit he set out the next morning for Pianura. Ahalf-melancholy interest drew him back to the scene of his lonelychildhood, and he had started early in order to push on that night toPontesordo. At Valsecca, the regular posting-station between Vercelliand Pianura, he sent Cantapresto forward to the capital, and in a stormyyellow twilight drove alone across the waste land that dipped to themarshes. On his right the woods of the ducal chase hung black againstthe sky; and presently he saw ahead of him the old square keep, with aflight of swallows circling low about its walls.</p> 
<p>　　In the muddy farm-yard a young man was belabouring a donkey laden withmulberry-shoots. He stared for a moment at Odo's approach and thensullenly returned to his task.</p> 
<p>　　Odo sprang out into the mud. "Why do you beat the brute?" said heindignantly. The other turned a dull face on him and he recognised hisold enemy Giannozzo.</p> 
<p>　　"Giannozzo," he cried, "don't you know me? I am the Cavaliere Valsecca,whose ears you used to box when you were a lad. Must you always bepummelling something, that you can't let that poor brute alone at theend of its day's work?"Giannozzo, dropping his staff, stammered out that he craved hisexcellency's pardon for not knowing him, but that as for the ass it wasa stubborn devil that would not have carried Jesus Christ withoutgibbing.</p> 
<p>　　"The beast is tired and hungry," cried Odo, his old compassion for thesufferings of the farm-animals suddenly reviving. "How many hours haveyou worked it without rest or food?""No more than I have worked myself," said Giannozzo sulkily; "and as forits being hungry, why should it fare better than its masters?"Their words had called out of the house a lean bent woman, whoseshrivelled skin showed through the rents in her unbleached shift. Atsight of Odo she pushed Giannozzo aside and hurried forward to ask howshe might serve the gentleman.</p> 
<p>　　"With supper and a bed, my good Filomena," said Odo; and she flungherself at his feet with a cry.</p> 
<p>　　"Saints of heaven, that I should not have known his excellency! But I amhalf blind with the fever, and who could have dreamed of such anhonour?" She clung to his knees in the mud, kissing his hands andcalling down blessings on him. "And as for you, Giannozzo, youcurd-faced fool, quick, see that his excellency's horses are stabled andgo call your father from the cow-house while I prepare his excellency'ssupper. And fetch me in a faggot to light the fire in the bailiff'sparlour."Odo followed her into the kitchen, where he had so often crouched in acorner to eat his polenta out of reach of her vigorous arm. The roofseemed lower and more smoke-blackened than ever, but the hearth wascold, and he noticed that no supper was laid. Filomena led him into thebailiff's parlour, where a mortal chill seized him. Cobwebs hung fromthe walls, the window-panes were broken and caked with grime, and thefew green twigs which Giannozzo presently threw on the hearth poured acloud of smoke into the cold heavy air.</p> 
<p>　　There was a long delay while supper was preparing, and when at lengthFilomena appeared, it was only to produce, with many excuses, a loaf ofvetch-bread, a bit of cheese and some dried quinces. There was nothingelse in the house, she declared: not so much as a bit of lard to makesoup with, a handful of pasti or a flask of wine. In the old days, ashis excellency might remember, they had eaten a bit of meat on Sundays,and drunk aquarolle with their supper; but since the new taxes it was asmuch as the farmers could do to feed their cattle, without having ascrap to spare for themselves. Jacopone, she continued, was bent doublewith the rheumatism, and had not been able to drive a plough or to workin the mulberries for over two years. He and the farm-lads sat in thecow-stables when their work was over, for the sake of the heat, and shecarried their black bread out there to them: a cold supper tasted betterin a warm place, and as his excellency knew, all the windows in thehouse were unglazed save in the bailiff's parlour. Her man would be inpresently to pay his duty to his excellency; but he had growndull-witted since the rheumatism took him, and his excellency must nottake it ill if his talk was a little childish.</p> 
<p>　　Thereupon Filomena excused herself, that she might put a clean shirt onJacopone, and Odo was left to his melancholy musings. His mind had oflate run much on economic abuses; but what was any philandering withreform to this close contact with misery? It was as though white hungryfaces had suddenly stared in at the windows of his brightly-lit life.</p> 
<p>　　What did these people care for education, enlightenment, the religion ofhumanity? What they wanted was fodder for their cattle, a bit of meat onSundays and a faggot on the hearth.</p> 
<p>　　Filomena presently returned with her husband; but Jacopone had shrunkinto a crippled tremulous old man, who pulled a vague forelock at Odowithout sign of recognition. Filomena, it was clear, was master atPontesordo; for though Giannozzo was a man grown, and did a man's work,he still danced to the tune of his mother's tongue. It was from her thatOdo, shivering over the smoky hearth, gathered the details of theirwretched state. Pontesordo being a part of the ducal domain, they hadled in their old days an easier life than their neighbours; but the newtaxes had stripped them as bare as a mulberry-tree in June.</p> 
<p>　　"How is a Christian to live, excellency, with the salt-tax doubled, sothat the cows go dry for want of it; with half a zecchin on every pairof oxen, a stajo of wheat and two fowls to the parish, and not so muchas a bite of grass allowed on the Duke's lands? In his late Highness'sday the poor folk were allowed to graze their cattle on the borders ofthe chase; but now a man dare not pluck a handful of weeds there, or somuch as pick up a fallen twig; though the deer may trample his youngwheat, and feed off the patch of beans at his very door. They do say theDuchess has a kind heart, and gives away money to the towns-folk; but wecountry-people who spend our lives raising fodder for her game neverhear of her Highness but when one of her game-keepers comes down on usfor poaching or stealing wood.--Yes, by the saints, and it was herHighness who sent a neighbour's lad to the galleys last year for fellinga tree in the chase; a good lad as ever dug furrow, but he lacked woodfor a new plough-share, and how in God's name was he to plough his fieldwithout it?"So she went on, like a torrent after the spring rains; but when he namedMomola she fell silent, and Giannozzo, looking sideways, drummed withhis heel on the floor.</p> 
<p>　　Odo glanced from one to the other. "She's dead, then?" he cried.</p> 
<p>　　Filomena opened deprecating palms. "Can one tell, excellency? It may beshe is off with the gypsies.""The gypsies? How long since?""Giannozzo," cried his mother, as he stood glowering, "go see that thestable is locked and his excellency's horses bedded down." He slunk outand she began to gather up the remains of Odo's meagre supper.</p> 
<p>　　"But you must remember when this happened.""Holy Mother! It was the year we had frost in April and lost ourhatching for want of leaves. But as for that child of ingratitude, oneday she was here, the next she was gone--clean gone, as a nut drops fromthe tree--and I that had given the blood of my veins to nourish her!</p> 
<p>　　Since then, God is my witness, we have had nothing but misfortune. Thenext year it was the weevils in the wheat; and so it goes."Odo was silent, seeing it was vain to press her. He fancied that thegirl must have died--of neglect perhaps, or ill usage--and that theyfeared to own it. His heart swelled, but not against them: they seemedto him no more accountable than cowed hunger-driven animals.</p> 
<p>　　He tossed impatiently on the hard bed Filomena had made up for him inthe bailiff's parlour, and was afoot again with the first light.</p> 
<p>　　Stepping out into the farm-yard he looked abroad over the flat grey faceof the land. Around the keep stretched the new-ploughed fields and thepollarded mulberry orchards; but these, with the clustered hovels of thevillage, formed a mere islet in the surrounding waste of marsh andwoodland. The scene symbolised fitly enough of social conditions of thecountry: the over-crowded peasantry huddled on their scant patches ofarable ground, while miles of barren land represented the feudal rightsthat hemmed them in on every side.</p> 
<p>　　Odo walked across the yard to the chapel. On the threshold he stumbledover a heap of mulberry-shoots and a broken plough-share. Twilight heldthe place; but as he stood there the frescoes started out in the slantof the sunrise like dead faces floating to the surface of a river. Deadfaces, yes: plaintive spectres of his childish fears and longings, lostin the harsh daylight of experience. He had forgotten the very dreamsthey stood for: Lethe flowed between and only one voice reached acrossthe torrent. It was that of Saint Francis, lover of the poor...</p> 
<p>　　The morning was hot as Odo drove toward Pianura, and limping ahead ofhim in the midday glare he presently saw the figure of a hump-backed manin a decent black dress and three-cornered hat. There was somethingfamiliar in the man's gait, and in the shape of his large head, poisedon narrow stooping shoulders, and as the carriage drew abreast of him,Odo, leaning from the window, cried out, "Brutus--this must be Brutus!""Your excellency has the advantage of me," said the hunchback, turningon him a thin face lit by the keen eyes that had once searched hischildish soul.</p> 
<p>　　Odo met the rebuff with a smile. "Does that," said he, "prevent mysuggesting that you might continue your way more comfortably in mycarriage? The road is hot and dusty, and, as you see, I am in want ofcompany."The pedestrian, who seemed unprepared for this affable rejoinder, hadthe sheepish air of a man whose rudeness has missed the mark.</p> 
<p>　　"Why, sir," said he, recovering himself, "comfort is all a matter ofhabit, and I daresay the jolting of your carriage might seem to me moreunpleasant than the heat and dust of the road, to which necessity haslong since accustomed me.""In that case," returned Odo with increasing amusement, "you will havethe additional merit of sacrificing your pleasure to add to mine."The hunchback stared. "And what have you or yours ever done for me," heretorted, "that I should sacrifice to your pleasure even the wretchedprivilege of being dusted by the wheels of your coach?""Why, that," replied Odo, "is a question I can scarce answer till yougive me the opportunity of naming myself.--If you are indeed CarloGamba," he continued, "I am your old friend and companion Odo Valsecca."The hunchback started. "The Cavaliere Valsecca!" he cried. "I had heardthat you were expected." He stood gazing at Odo. "Our next Duke!" hemuttered.</p> 
<p>　　Odo smiled. "I had rather," he said, "that my past commended me than myfuture. It is more than doubtful if I am ever able to offer you a seatin the Duke's carriage; but Odo Valsecca's is very much at yourservice."Gamba bowed with a kind of awkward dignity. "I am grateful for afriend's kindness," he said, "but I do not ride in a nobleman'scarriage.""There," returned Odo with perfect good-humour, "you have had advantageof ME; for I can no more escape doing so than you can escape spendingyour life in the company of an ill-tempered man." And courteouslylifting his hat he called to the postillion to drive on.</p> 
<p>　　The hunchback at this, flushing red, laid a hand on the carriage door.</p> 
<p>　　"Sir," said he, "I freely own myself in the wrong; but a smooth temperwas not one of the blessings my unknown parents bequeathed to me; and Iconfess I had heard of you as one little concerned with your inferiorsexcept as they might chance to serve your pleasure."It was Odo's turn to colour. "Look," said he, "at the fallibility ofrumour; for I had heard of you as something of a philosopher, and here Ifind you not only taking a man's character on hearsay but denying himthe chance to prove you mistaken!""I deny it no longer," said Gamba stepping into the coach; "but as tophilosophy, the only claim I can make to it is that of being by birth aperipatetic."His dignity appeased, the hunchback proved himself a most engagingcompanion, and as the carriage lumbered slowly toward Pianura he hadtime not only to recount his own history but to satisfy Odo as to manypoints of the life awaiting him.</p> 
<p>　　Gamba, it appeared, owed his early schooling to a Jesuit priest who,visiting the foundling asylum, had been struck by the child's quickness,and had taken him home and bred him to be a clerk. The priest's deathleft his charge adrift, with a smattering of scholarship above hisstation, and none to whom he could turn for protection. For a while hehad lived, as he said, like a street-cat, picking up a meal where hecould, and sleeping in church porches and under street-arcades, till oneof the Duke's servants took pity on him and he was suffered to hangabout the palace and earn his keep by doing the lacquey's errands. TheDuke's attention having been called to him as a lad of parts, hisHighness had given him to the Marquess of Cerveno, in whose service heremained till shortly before that young nobleman's death. The hunchbackpassed hastily over this period; but his reticence was lit by the angryflash of his eyes. After the Marquess's death he had lived for a whilefrom hand to mouth, copying music, writing poetry for weddings andfunerals, doing pen-and-ink portraits at a scudo apiece, and putting hishand to any honest job that came his way. Count Trescorre, who now andthen showed a fitful recognition of the tie that was supposed to connectthem, at length heard of the case to which he was come and offered him atrifling pension. This the hunchback refused, asking instead to be givensome fixed employment. Trescorre then obtained his appointment asassistant to the Duke's librarian, a good old priest engrossed incompiling the early history of Pianura from the ducal archives; and thispost Gamba had now filled for two years.</p> 
<p>　　"It must," said Odo, "be one singularly congenial to you, if, as I haveheard, you are of a studious habit. Though I suppose," he tentativelyadded, "the library is not likely to be rich in works of the newscientific and philosophic schools."His companion received this observation in silence; and after a momentOdo continued: "I have a motive in asking, since I have been somewhatdeeply engaged in the study of these writers, and my dearest wish is tocontinue while in Pianura my examination of their theories, and ifpossible to become acquainted with any who share their views."He was not insensible of the risk of thus opening himself to a stranger;but the sense of peril made him the more eager to proclaim himself onthe side of the cause he seemed to have deserted.</p> 
<p>　　Gamba turned as he spoke, and their eyes met in one of those revealingglances that lay the foundations of friendship.</p> 
<p>　　"I fear, Cavaliere," said the hunchback with a smile, "that you willfind both branches of investigation somewhat difficult to pursue inPianura; for the Church takes care that neither the philosophers northeir books shall gain a footing in our most Christian state. Indeed,"he added, "not only must the library be free from heretical works, butthe librarian clear of heretical leanings; and since you have honouredme with your confidence I will own that, the court having got wind of mysupposed tendency to liberalism, I live in daily expectation ofdismissal. For the moment they are content to keep their spies on me;but were it not for the protection of the good abate, my superior, Ishould long since have been turned out.""And why," asked Odo, "do you speak of the court and the Church as one?""Because, sir, in our virtuous duchy the terms are interchangeable. TheDuke is in fact so zealous a son of the Church that if the latter showedany leniency to sinners the secular arm would promptly repair hernegligence. His Highness, as you may have heard, is ruled by hisconfessor, an adroit Dominican. The confessor, it is true, has tworivals, the Countess Belverde, a lady distinguished for her piety, and aGerman astrologer or alchemist, lately come to Pianura, and callinghimself a descendant of the Egyptian priesthood and an adept of thehigher or secret doctrines of Neoplatonism. These three, however, thoughostensibly rivals for the Duke's favour, live on such good terms withone another that they are suspected of having entered into a secretpartnership; while some regard them all as the emissaries of theJesuits, who, since the suppression of the Society, are known to havekept a footing in Pianura, as in most of the Italian states. As to theDuke, the death of the Marquess of Cerveno, the failing health of thelittle prince, and his own strange physical infirmities, have so preyedon his mind that he is the victim of any who are unscrupulous enough totrade on the fears of a diseased imagination. His counsellors, howeverdivided in doctrine, have at least one end in common; and that is, tokeep the light of reason out of the darkened chamber in which they haveconfined him; and with such a ruler and such principles of government,you may fancy that poor philosophy has not where to lay her head.""And the people?" Odo pursued. "What of the fiscal administration? Insome states where liberty of thought is forbidden the material welfareof the subject is nevertheless considered."The hunchback shook his head. "It may be so," said he, "though I hadthought the principle of moral tyranny must infect every branch ofpublic administration. With us, at all events, where the Church partyrules, the privileges and exemptions of the clergy are the chief sourceof suffering, and the state of passive ignorance in which they have keptthe people has bred in the latter a dull resignation that is the surestobstacle to reform. Oh, sir," he cried, his eyes darkening with emotion,"if you could see, as I do, the blind brute misery on which all themagnificence of rank and all the refinements of luxury are built, youwould feel, as you drive along this road, that with every turn of thewheels you are passing over the bodies of those who have toiled withoutceasing that you might ride in a gilt coach, and have gone hungry thatyou might feast in Kings' palaces!"The touch of rhetoric in this adjuration did not discredit it with Odo,to whom the words were as caustic on an open wound. He turned to makesome impulsive answer; but as he did so he caught sight of the towers ofPianura rising above the orchards and market-gardens of the suburbs. Thesight started a new train of feeling, and Gamba, perceiving it, saidquietly: "But this is no time to speak of such things."A moment later the carriage had passed under the great battlementedgates, with their Etruscan bas-reliefs, and the motto of the house ofValsecca--Humilitas--surmounted by the ducal escutcheon.</p> 
<p>　　Though the hour was close on noon the streets were as animated as at theangelus, and the carriage could hardly proceed for the crowd obstructingits passage. So unusual at that period was such a sight in one of thelesser Italian cities that Odo turned to Gamba for an explanation. Atthe same moment a roar rose from the crowd; and the coach turning intothe Corso which led to the ducal palace and the centre of the town, Odocaught sight of a strange procession advancing from that direction. Itwas headed by a clerk or usher with a black cap and staff, behind whommarched two bare-foot friars escorting between them a middle-aged man inthe dress of an abate, his hands bound behind him and his headsurmounted by a paste-board mitre inscribed with the title: A Destroyerof Female Chastity. This man, who was of a simple and decent aspect, wasso dazed by the buffeting of the crowd, so spattered by the mud andfilth hurled at him from a hundred taunting hands, and his countenancedistorted by so piteous a look of animal fear, that he seemed more likea madman being haled to Bedlam than a penitent making public amends forhis offence.</p> 
<p>　　"Are such failings always so severely punished in Pianura?" Odo asked,turning ironically to Gamba as the mob and its victim passed out ofsight.</p> 
<p>　　The hunchback smiled. "Not," said he, "if the offender be in a positionto benefit by the admirable doctrines of probabilism, the direction ofintention, or any one of the numerous expedients by which an indulgentChurch has smoothed the way of the sinner; but as God does not give thecrop unless man sows the seed, so His ministers bestow grace only whenthe penitent has enriched the treasury. The fellow," he added, "is a manof some learning and of a retired and orderly way of living, and thecharge was brought against him by a jeweller and his wife, who owed hima sum of money and are said to have chosen this way of evading payment.</p> 
<p>　　The priests are always glad to find a scape-goat of the sort, especiallywhen there are murmurs against the private conduct of those in highplaces, and the woman, having denounced him, was immediately assured byher confessor that any debt incurred to a seducer was null and void, andthat she was entitled to a hundred scudi of damages for having been ledinto sin."</p>
