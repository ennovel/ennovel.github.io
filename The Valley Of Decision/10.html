The air waslight and pure, the shady turf invited him, and dismounting he bid hisservant lead the horses to the wayside inn half way down the slope.</p> 
<p>　　The spot he had chosen, though secluded as some nook above the gorge ofDonnaz, commanded a view of the Po rolling at his feet like a flood ofyellowish metal, and beyond, outspread in clear spring sunshine, thegreat city in the bosom of the plain. The spectacle was fair enough totouch any fancy: brown domes and facades set in new-leaved gardens andsurrounded by vineyards extending to the nearest acclivities;country-houses glancing through the fresh green of planes and willows;monastery-walls cresting the higher ridges; and westward the Po windingin sunlit curves toward the Alps.</p> 
<p>　　Odo had lost none of his sensitiveness to such impressions; but the swayof another mood turned his eye from the outstretched beauty of the cityto the vernal solitude about him. It was the season when old memories ofDonnaz worked in his blood; when the banks and hedges of the freshhill-country about Turin cheated him with a breath of buddingbeech-groves and the fragrance of crushed fern in the glens of the highPennine valleys. It was a mere waft, perhaps, from some clod of loosenedearth, or the touch of cool elastic moss as he flung himself facedownward under the trees; but the savour, the contact filled hisnostrils with mountain air and his eyes with dim-branched distances. AtDonnaz the slow motions of the northern spring had endeared to him allthose sweet incipiencies preceding the full choral burst of leaf andflower: the mauve mist over bare woodlands, the wet black gleams infrost-bound hollows, the thrust of fronds through withered bracken, theprimrose-patches spreading like pale sunshine along wintry lanes. He hadalways felt a sympathy for these delicate unnoted changes; but thefeeling which had formerly been like the blind stir of sap in a plantwas now a conscious sensation that groped for speech and understanding.</p> 
<p>　　He had grown up among people to whom such emotions were unknown. The oldMarquess's passion for his fields and woods was the love of theagriculturist and the hunter, not that of the naturalist or the poet;and the aristocracy of the cities regarded the country merely as so muchsoil from which to draw their maintenance. The gentlefolk never absentedthemselves from town but for a few weeks of autumn, when they went totheir villas for the vintage, transporting thither all the diversions ofcity life and venturing no farther afield than the pleasure-grounds thatwere but so many open-air card-rooms, concert-halls and theatres. Odo'stenderness for every sylvan function of renewal and decay, everyshifting of light and colour on the flying surface of the year, wouldhave been met with the same stare with which a certain enchantingCountess had received the handful of wind-flowers that, fresh from asunrise on the hills, he had laid one morning among her toilet-boxes.</p> 
<p>　　The Countess Clarice had stared and laughed, and every one of hisacquaintance, Alfieri even, would have echoed her laugh; but one man atleast had felt the divine commotion of nature's touch, had felt andinterpreted it, in words as fresh as spring verdure, in the pages of avolume that Odo now drew from his pocket.</p> 
<p>　　"I longed to dream, but some unexpected spectacle continually distractedme from my musings. Here immense rocks hung their ruinous masses abovemy head; there the thick mist of roaring waterfalls enveloped me; orsome unceasing torrent tore open at my very feet an abyss into which thegaze feared to plunge. Sometimes I was lost in the twilight of a thickwood; sometimes, on emerging from a dark ravine, my eyes were charmed bythe sight of an open meadow...Nature seemed to revel in unwontedcontrasts; such varieties of aspect had she united in one spot. Here wasan eastern prospect bright with spring flowers, while autumn fruitsripened to the south and the northern face of the scene was still lockedin wintry frosts...Add to this the different angles at which the peakstook the light, the chiaroscuro of sun and shade, and the variations oflight resulting from it at morning and evening...sum up the impressionsI have tried to describe and you will be able to form an idea of theenchanting situation in which I found myself...The scene has indeed amagical, a supernatural quality, which so ravishes the spirit and sensesthat one seems to lose all exact notion of one's surroundings andidentity."This was a new language to eighteenth-century readers. Already it hadswept through the length and breadth of France, like a spring storm-windbursting open doors and windows, and filling close candle-lit rooms withwet gusts and the scent of beaten blossoms; but south of the Alps thenew ideas travelled slowly, and the Piedmontese were as yet scarce awareof the man who had written thus of their own mountains. It was truethat, some thirty years earlier, in one of the very monasteries on whichOdo now looked down, a Swiss vagrant called Rousseau had embraced thetrue faith with the most moving signs of edification; but the rescue ofHelvetian heretics was a favourite occupation of the Turinese nobilityand it is doubtful if any recalled the name of the strange proselyte whohad hastened to signalise his conversion by robbing his employers andslandering an innocent maid-servant. Odo in fact owed his firstacquaintance with the French writers to Alfieri, who, in the intervalsof his wandering over Europe, now and then reappeared in Turin ladenwith the latest novelties in Transalpine literature and haberdashery.</p> 
<p>　　What his eccentric friend failed to provide, Odo had little difficultyin obtaining for himself; for though most of the new writers were on theIndex, and the Sardinian censorship was notoriously severe, there wasnever yet a barrier that could keep out books, and Cantapresto was askilled purveyor of contraband dainties. Odo had thus acquainted himselfwith the lighter literature of England and France; and though he hadread but few philosophical treatises, was yet dimly aware of the newstandpoint from which, north of the Alps, men were beginning to test theaccepted forms of thought. The first disturbance of his childish faith,and the coincident reading of the Lettres Philosophiques, had beenfollowed by a period of moral perturbation, during which he sufferedfrom that sense of bewilderment, of inability to classify the phenomenaof life, that is one of the keenest trials of inexperience. Youth andnature had their way with him, however, and a wholesome reaction ofindifference set in. The invisible world of thought and conduct had beenthe frequent subject of his musings; but the other, tangible world wasclose to him too, spreading like a rich populous plain between himselfand the distant heights of speculation. The old doubts, the olddissatisfactions, hung on the edge of consciousness; but he was tooprofoundly Italian not to linger awhile in that atmosphere of carelessacquiescence that is so pleasant a medium for the unhampered enjoymentof life. Some day, no doubt, the intellectual curiosity and the moraldisquietude would revive; but what he wanted now were books whichappealed not to his reason but to his emotions, which reflected as in amirror the rich and varied life of the senses: books that were warm tothe touch, like the little volume in his hand.</p> 
<p>　　For it was not only of nature that the book spoke. Amid scenes of suchrustic freshness were set human passions as fresh and natural: a greatromantic love, subdued to duty, yet breaking forth again and again asyoung shoots spring from the root of a felled tree. Toeighteenth-century readers such a picture of life was as new as itssetting. Duty, in that day, to people of quality, meant the observanceof certain fixed conventions: the correct stepping of a moral minuet; asan inner obligation, as a voluntary tribute to Diderot's "divinity onearth," it had hardly yet drawn breath. To depict a personal relation somuch purer and more profound than any form of sentiment then in fashion,and then to subordinate it, unflinchingly, to the ideal of those largerrelations that link the individual to the group--this was a stroke oforiginality for which it would be hard to find a parallel in modernfiction. Here at last was an answer to the blind impulses agrope inOdo's breast--the loosening of those springs of emotion that gushedforth in such fresh contrast to the stagnant rills of the sentimentalpleasure-garden. To renounce a Julie would be more thrilling than--Odo, with a sigh, thrust the book in his pocket and rose to his feet. Itwas the hour of the promenade at the Valentino and he had promised theCountess Clarice to attend her. The old high-roofed palace of the Frenchprincess lay below him, in its gardens along the river: he could figure,as he looked down on it, the throng of carriages and chairs, themodishly dressed riders, the pedestrians crowding the footpath to watchthe quality go by. The vision of all that noise and glitter deepened thesweetness of the woodland hush. He sighed again. Suddenly voices soundedin the road below--a man's speech flecked with girlish laughter. Odohung back listening: the girl's voice rang like a bird-call through hisrustling fancies. Presently she came in sight: a slender black-mantledfigure hung on the arm of an elderly man in the sober dress of one ofthe learned professions--a physician or a lawyer, Odo guessed. Theirbeing afoot, and the style of the man's dress, showed that they were ofthe middle class; their demeanour, that they were father and daughter.</p> 
<p>　　The girl moved with a light forward flowing of her whole body thatseemed the pledge of grace in every limb: of her face Odo had but abright glimpse in the eclipse of her flapping hat-brim. She stood underhis tree unheeded; but as they rose abreast of him the girl paused anddropped her companion's arm.</p> 
<p>　　"Look! The cherry flowers!" she cried, and stretched her arms to a whitegush of blossoms above the wall across the road. The movement tiltedback her hat, and Odo caught her small fine profile, wide-browed as thehead on some Sicilian coin, with a little harp-shaped ear bedded in darkripples.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh," she wailed, straining on tiptoe, "I can't reach them!"Her father smiled. "May temptation," said he philosophically, "alwayshang as far out of your reach.""Temptation?" she echoed.</p> 
<p>　　"Is it not theft you're bent on?""Theft? This is a monk's orchard, not a peasant's plot.""Confiscation, then," he humorously conceded.</p> 
<p>　　"Since they pay no taxes on their cherries they might at least," sheargued, "spare a few to us poor taxpayers.""Ah," said her father, "I want to tax their cherries, not to gatherthem." He slipped a hand through her arm. "Come, child," said he, "doesnot the philosopher tell us that he who enjoys a thing possesses it? Theflowers are yours already!""Oh, are they?" she retorted. "Then why doesn't the loaf in the baker'swindow feed the beggar that looks in at it?""Casuist!" he cried and drew her up the bend of the road.</p> 
<p>　　Odo stood gazing after them. Their words, their aspect, seemed an echoof his reading. The father in his plain broadcloth and square-buckledshoes, the daughter with her unpowdered hair and spreading hat, mighthave stepped from the pages of the romance. What a breath of freshnessthey brought with them! The girl's cheek was clear as thecherry-blossoms, and with what lovely freedom did she move! Thus Juliemight have led Saint Preux through her "Elysium." Odo crossed the roadand, breaking one of the blossoming twigs, thrust it in the breast ofhis uniform. Then he walked down the hill to the inn where the horseswaited. Half an hour later he rode up to the house where he lodged inthe Piazza San Carlo.</p> 
<p>　　In the archway Cantapresto, heavy with a nine years' accretion of fat,laid an admonishing hand on his bridle.</p> 
<p>　　"Cavaliere, the Countess's black boy--""Well?""Three several times has battered the door down with a missive.""Well?""The last time, I shook him off with the message that you would be therebefore him.""Be where?""At the Valentino; but that was an hour ago!"Odo slipped from the saddle.</p> 
<p>　　"I must dress first. Call a chair; or no--write a letter for me first.</p> 
<p>　　Let Antonio carry it."The ex-soprano, wheezing under the double burden of flesh andconsequence, had painfully laboured after Odo up the high stone flightsto that young gentleman's modest lodgings, and they stood together in astudy lined with books and hung with prints and casts from the antique.</p> 
<p>　　Odo threw off his dusty coat and called the servant to remove his boots.</p> 
<p>　　"Will you read the lady's letters, cavaliere?" Cantapresto asked,obsequiously offering them on a lacquered tray.</p> 
<p>　　"No--no: write first. Begin 'My angelic lady'--""You began the last letter in those terms, cavaliere," his scribereminded him with suspended pen.</p> 
<p>　　"The devil! Well, then--wait. 'Throned goddess'--""You ended the last letter with 'throned goddess.'""Curse the last letter! Why did you send it?" Odo sprang up and slippedhis arms into the dress-tunic his servant had brought him. "Writeanything. Say that I am suddenly summoned by--""By the Count Alfieri?" Cantapresto suggested.</p> 
<p>　　"Count Alfieri? Is he here? He has returned?""He arrived an hour ago, cavaliere. He sent you this Moorish scimitarwith his compliments. I understand he comes recently from Spain.""Imbecile, not to have told me before! Quick, Antonio--my gloves, mysword." Odo, flushed and animated, buckled his sword-belt with impatienthands. "Write anything--anything to free my evening. Tomorrowmorning--tomorrow morning I shall wait on the lady. Let Antonio carryher a nosegay with my compliments. Did you see him Cantapresto? Was hein good health? Does he sup at home? He left no message? Quick, Antonio,a chair!" he cried with his hand on the door.</p> 
<p>　　Odo had acquired, at twenty-two, a nobility of carriage not incompatiblewith the boyish candour of his gaze, and becomingly set off by thebrilliant dress-uniform of a lieutenant in one of the provincialregiments. He was tall and fair, and a certain languor of complexion,inherited from his father's house, was corrected in him by the vivacityof the Donnaz blood. This now sparkled in his grey eye, and gave a glowto his cheek, as he stepped across the threshold, treading on a sprig ofcherry-blossom that had dropped unnoticed to the floor.</p> 
<p>　　Cantapresto, looking after him, caught sight of the flowers and kickedthem aside with a contemptuous toe. "I sometimes think he botanises," hemurmured with a shrug. "The Lord knows what queer notions he gets out ofall these books!"</p>
