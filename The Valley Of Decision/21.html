<p>　　"I am," said he, "much like a stranger at a masked ball, where all themasks are acquainted with each other's disguises and concerted tomystify the visitor. Among the persons I have met at court several haveshown themselves ready to guide me through this labyrinth; but, tillthey themselves unmask and declare their true characters, I am doubtfulwhither they may lead me; nor do I know of any so well fitted asyourself to give me a clue to my surroundings. As for my own disguise,"he added with a smile, "I believe I removed it sufficiently on our firstmeeting to leave you no doubt as to the use to which your informationwill be put."Gamba, who seemed touched by this appeal, nevertheless hesitated beforereplying. At length he said: "I have the fullest trust in yourexcellency's honour; but I must remind you that during your stay hereyou will be under the closest observation and that any opinions youexpress will at once be attributed to the persons you are known tofrequent. I would not," he continued hastily, "say this for myselfalone, but I have two mouths to feed and my views are already undersuspicion."Reassured by Odo's protestations, or rather, perhaps, by the moreconvincing warrant of his look and manner, Gamba proceeded to give him adetailed description of the little world in which chance had placedthem.</p> 
<p>　　"If you have seen the Duke," said he, "I need not tell you that it isnot he who governs the duchy. We are ruled at present by a triumvirateconsisting of the Belverde, the Dominican and Trescorre. Pievepelago,the Prime Minister, is a dummy put in place by the Jesuits and keptthere by the rivalries of the other three; but he is in his dotage andthe courtiers are already laying wagers as to his successor. Many thinkFather Ignazio will replace him, but I stake my faith on Trescorre. TheDuke dislikes him, but he is popular with the middle class, who, sincethey have shaken off the yoke of the Jesuits, would not willingly see anecclesiastic at the head of the state. The duchess's influence is alsoagainst the Dominican, for her Highness, being, as you know, connectedwith the Austrian court, is by tradition unfavourable to the Churchparty. The Duchess's preferences would weigh little with the Duke wereit not that she is sole heiress to the old Duke of Monte Alloro, andthat any attempt to bring that principality under the control of theHoly See might provoke the interference of Austria.</p> 
<p>　　"In so ticklish a situation I see none but Trescorre to maintain thepolitical balance. He has been adroit enough to make himself necessaryto the Duchess without alienating the Duke; he has introduced one or twotrifling reforms that have given him a name for liberality in spite ofthe heavy taxes with which he has loaded the peasantry; and has in shortso played his cards as to profit by the foibles of both parties. HerHighness," he continued, in reply to a question of Odo's, "was muchtaken by him when she first came to Pianura; and before her feeling hadcooled he had contrived to make himself indispensable to her. TheDuchess is always in debt; and Trescorre, as Comptroller of Finance,holds her by her besetting weakness. Before his appointment herextravagance was the scandal of the town. She borrowed from her ladies,her pages, her very lacqueys; when she went on a visit to her uncle ofMonte Alloro she pocketed the money he bestowed on her servants; nay,she was even accused of robbing the Marchioness of Pievepelago, who,having worn one evening a diamond necklace which excited her Highness'sadmiration, was waylaid on the way home and the jewels torn from herneck by a crowd of masked ruffians among whom she is said to haverecognised one of the ducal servants. These are doubtless idle reports;but it is certain that Trescorre's appointment engaged him still more tothe Duchess by enabling him to protect her from such calumnies; while byincreasing the land taxes he has discharged the worst of her debts andthus made himself popular with the tradesmen she had ruined. Yourexcellency must excuse my attempting to paint the private character ofher Highness. Such facts as I have reported are of public notoriety, butto exceed them would be an unwarranted presumption. I know she has thename of being affable to her dependents, capable of a fitful generosity,and easily moved by distress; and it is certain that her domesticsituation has been one to excite pity and disarm criticism.</p> 
<p>　　"With regard to his Highness, it is difficult either to detect hismotives or to divine his preferences. His youth was spent in piouspractices; and a curious reason is given for the origin of this habit.</p> 
<p>　　He was educated, as your excellency is doubtless aware, by a Frenchphilosopher of the school of Hobbes; and it is said that in the intervalof his tasks the poor Duke, bewildered by his governor's distinctionsbetween conception and cognition, and the object and the sentient, usedto spend his time praying the saints to assist him in his atheisticalstudies; indeed a satire of the day ascribes him as making a novena tothe Virgin to obtain a clearer understanding of the universality ofmatter. Others with more likelihood aver that he frequented the churchesto escape from the tyranny of his pedagogue; and it is certain that fromone cause or another his education threw him into the opposite extremeof a superstitious and mechanical piety. His marriage, his differenceswith the Duchess, and the evil influence of Cerveno, exposed him to newtemptations, and for a time he led a life which seemed to justify theworst charges of the enemies of materialism. Recent events have flunghim back on the exaggerated devotion of his youth, and now, when hishealth permits, he spends his time serving mass, singing in the choir atbenediction and making pilgrimages to the relics of the saints in thedifferent churches of the duchy.</p> 
<p>　　"A few years since, at the instigation of his confessor, he destroyedevery picture in the ducal gallery that contained any naked figure orrepresented any subject offensive to religion. Among them was Titian'sfamous portrait of Duke Ascanio's mistress, known as the Goldsmith'sDaughter, and a Venus by the Venetian painter Giorgione, so highlyesteemed in its day that Pope Leo X. is said to have offered in exchangefor it the gift of a papal benefice, and a Cardinal's hat for DukeGuidobaldo's younger son. His Highness, moreover, impedes theadministration of justice by resisting all attempts to restrict theChurch's right of sanctuary, and upholds the decree forbidding hissubjects to study at the University of Pavia, where, as you know, thenatural sciences are professed by the ablest scholars of Italy. Heallows no public duties to interfere with his private devotions, andwhatever the urgency of affairs, gives no audience to his ministers onholydays; and a Cardinal a latere recently passing through the duchy onhis return to Rome was not received at the Duke's table because hechanced to arrive on a Friday.</p> 
<p>　　"His Highness's fears for Prince Ferrante's health have drawn a swarm ofquacks to Pianura, and the influence of the Church is sometimescounteracted by that of the physicians with whom the Duke surroundshimself. The latest of these, the famous Count Heiligenstern, who issaid to have performed some remarkable cures by means of the electricalfluid and of animal magnetism, has gained such an ascendancy over theDuke that some suspect him of being an agent of the Austrian court,while others declare that he is a Jesuit en robe courte. But just atpresent the people scent a Jesuit under every habit, and it is evenrumoured that the Belverde is secretly affiliated to a female branch ofthe Society. With such a sovereign and such ministers, your excellencyneed not be told how the state is governed. Trescorre, heaven save themark! represents the liberal party; but his liberalism is like thegenerosity of the unarmed traveller who throws his purse to a foot-pad;and Father Ignazio is at hand to see that the people are not bettered atthe expense of the Church.</p> 
<p>　　"As to the Duke, having no settled policy, and being governed onlythrough his fears, he leans first to one influence and then to another;but since the suppression of the Jesuits nothing can induce him toattack any ecclesiastical privileges. The diocese of Pianura holds afief known as the Caccia del Vescovo, long noted as the most lawlessdistrict of the duchy. Before the death of the late Pope, Trescorre hadprevailed on the Duke to annex it to the principality; but the dreadfulfate of Ganganelli has checked bolder sovereigns than his Highness intheir attempts on the immunities of the Church, and one of the fairestregions of our unhappy state remains a barren waste, the lair of outlawsand assassins, and a menace to the surrounding country. His Highness isnot incapable of generous impulses and his occasional acts of humanitymight endear him to his people were it not that they despise him forbeing the creature of his favourites. Thus, the gift of Boscofolto tothe Belverde has excited the bitterest discontent; for the Countess isnotorious for her cruel exactions, and it is certain that at her deaththis rich fief will revert to the Church. And now," Gamba ended with asmile, "I have made known to your excellency the chief characters in themasque, as rumour depicts them to the vulgar. As to the court, like thegovernment, it is divided into two parties: the Duke's, headed by theBelverde, and containing the staider and more conservative members ofthe Church and nobility; and the Duchess's, composed of every fribbleand flatterer, every gamester and rake, every intriguing woman andvulgar parvenu that can worm a way into her favour. In such anatmosphere you may fancy how knowledge thrives. The Duke's libraryconsists of a few volumes of theological casuistry, and her Highnessnever opens a book unless it be to scandalise her husband by readingsome prohibited pamphlet from France. The University, since the fall ofthe Jesuits, has been in charge of the Barnabite order, and, for aught Iknow, the Ptolemaic system is still taught there, together with thedialectic of Aristotle. As to science, it is anathema; and the pressbeing subject to the restrictions of the Holy Office, and the Universityclosed to modern thought, but few scholars are to be found in the duchy,save those who occupy themselves with belles-lettres, or, like the abateCrescenti, are engaged in historical research. Pianura, even in the lateDuke's day, had its circle of lettered noblemen who patronised the artsand founded the local Arcadia; but such pursuits are out of fashion, theArcadia languishes, and the Bishop of Pianura is the only dignitary thatstill plays the Mecaenas. His lordship, whose theological laxity andcoolness toward the Holy Office have put him out of favour with theDuke, has, I am told, a fine cabinet of paintings (some of them, it isrumoured, the very pictures that his Highness ordered to be burnt) andthe episcopal palace swarms with rhyming abatini, fashionableplaywrights and musicians, and the travelling archeologists who hawktheir antiques about from one court to another. Here you may assist atinterminable disputes as to the relative merits of Tasso and Ariosto, orlisten to a learned dissertation on the verse engraved on a carnelianstone; but as to the questions now agitating the world, they are held ofless account than a problem in counterpoint or the construction of adoubtful line in Ovid. As long as Truth goes naked she can scarce hopeto be received in good company; and her appearance would probably causeas much confusion among the Bishop's literati as in the councils of theHoly Office."The old analogy likening the human mind to an imperfect mirror, whichmodifies the images it reflects, occurred more than once to Odo duringthe hunchback's lively delineation. It was impossible not to rememberthat the speaker owed his education to the charity of the order hedenounced; and this fact suggested to Odo that the other lights andshadows in the picture might be disposed with more art than accuracy.</p> 
<p>　　Still, they doubtless embodied a negative truth, and Odo thought itprobable that such intellectual diversion as he could hope for must besought in the Bishop's circle.</p> 
<p>　　It was two days later that he first beheld that prelate, heading theducal pilgrimage to the shrine of the mountain Virgin. The day hadopened with a confused flight of chimes from every bell-tower inPianura, as though a migratory flock of notes had settled for a momenton the roofs and steeples of the city. The ducal party set forth earlyfrom the palace, but the streets were already spanned with arches andgarlands of foliage, tapestries and religious paintings decked thefacades of the wealthier houses, and at every street-shrine a cluster ofcandle-flames hovered like yellow butterflies above the freshly-gatheredflowers. The windows were packed with spectators, and the crowds whointended to accompany the pilgrimage were already gathering, with theirpainted and gilt candles, from every corner of the town. Each church andmonastery door poured forth its priests or friars to swell the line, andthe various lay confraternities, issuing in their distinctive dress fromtheir "lodges" or assembly-rooms, formed a link between the secular andreligious divisions of the procession. The market-place was strewn withsand and sweet herbs; and here, on the doorsteps of the Cathedral,between the featureless porphyry lions, the Bishop waited with hisred-robed chapter, and the deacons carrying the painted banners of thediocese. Seen thus, with the cloth-of-gold dalmatic above his pontificaltunic, the mitre surmounting his clear-cut impassive face, and thecrozier held aloft in his jewelled gloves, he might have stood for achryselephantine divinity in the porch of some pagan temple.</p> 
<p>　　Odo, riding beside the Duke's litter, had leisure to note not only thediverse features of the procession but their varying effect on thespectators. It was plain that, as Trescorre had said, the pilgrimage waspopular with the people. That imaginative sensuousness which hasperpetually renewed the Latin Church by giving form and colour to herdogmatic abstractions, by transforming every successive phase of herbelief into something to be seen and handled, found an irresistibleoutlet in a ceremony that seemed to combine with its devotional intent asecret element of expiation. The little prince was dimly felt to bepaying for the prodigality of his fathers, to be in some way a link ofsuffering between the tongue-tied misery of the fields and the insolentsplendour of the court; and a vague faith in the vicarious efficacy ofhis devotion drew the crowd into momentary sympathy with its rulers. Yetthis was but an underlying element in the instinctive delight of thepeople in the outward forms of their religion. Odo's late experienceshad wakened him to the influences acting on that obscure substratum ofhuman life that still seemed, to most men of his rank, of no moreaccount than the brick lining of their marble-coated palaces. As hewatched the mounting excitement of the throng, and pictured to himselfthe lives suddenly lit up by this pledge of unseen promises, he wonderedthat the enemies of the Church should ascribe her predominance to anycause but the natural needs of the heart. The people lived in unlithovels, for there was a tax on mental as well as on material windows;but here was a light that could pierce the narrowest crevice and scatterthe darkness with a single ray.</p> 
<p>　　Odo noted with equal interest the impression produced by the variousmembers of the court and the Church dignitaries. The Duke's litter wascoldly received, but a pitying murmur widened about the gilt chair inwhich Prince Ferrante was seated at his governor's side, and theapproach of Trescorre, mounted on a fine horse and dressed with hisusual sober elegance, woke a shout that made him for a moment thecentral figure of the procession. The Bishop was none too warmlywelcomed; but when Crescenti appeared, white-haired and erect among theparish priests, the crowd swayed toward him like grasses in the suctionof a current; and one of the Duke's gentlemen, seeing Odo's surprise,said with a smile: "No one does more good in Pianura than our learnedlibrarian."A different and still more striking welcome awaited the Duchess, whopresently appeared on her favourite white hackney, surrounded by themembers of her household. Her reluctance to take part in the pilgrimagehad been overcome by the exhilaration of showing herself to the public,and as she rode along in her gold-embroidered habit and plumed hat shewas just such an image of radiant and indulgent sovereignty as turnsenforced submission into a romantic allegiance. Her flushing cheek andkindled eye showed the reaction of the effect she produced, and if hersubjects forgot her debts, her violences and follies, she was perhapsmomentarily transformed into the being their enthusiasm created. She wasat any rate keenly alive to the admiration she excited and eager toenhance it by those showy impulses of benevolence that catch the publiceye; as when, at the city gates, she stopped her horse to intervene inbehalf of a soldier who had been put under arrest for some slightinfraction of duty, and then rode on enveloped in the passionateshouting of the crowd.</p> 
<p>　　The shrine at which the young prince was to pay his devotions stood justbeyond the city, on the summit of one of the low knolls which pass forhills in the level landscape of Pianura. The white-columned church withits classical dome and portico had been erected as a thank-offeringafter the plague of 1630, and the nave was lined with life-sized votivefigures of Dukes and Duchesses clad in the actual wigs and robes thathad dressed their transient grandeur. As the procession wound into thechurch, to the ringing of bells and the chanting of the choir, Odo wasstruck by the spectacle of that line of witnesses, watching inglassy-eyed irony the pomp and display to which their moldering robesand tarnished insignia seemed to fix so brief a term. Once or twicealready he had felt the shows of human power as no more than vanishingreflections on the tide of being; and now, as he knelt near the shrine,with its central glitter of jewels and its nimbus of wavering lights,and listened to the reiterated ancient wail:</p> 
<p>　　"Mater inviolata, ora pro nobis!</p> 
<p>　　Virgo veneranda, ora pro nobis!</p> 
<p>　　Speculum justitiae, ora pro nobis!"it seemed to him as though the bounds of life and death were merged, andthe sumptuous group of which he formed a part already dusted over withoblivion.</p>
