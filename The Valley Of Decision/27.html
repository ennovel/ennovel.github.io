A laughing group followed, headed by a tallvivacious woman covered with jewels, whom Odo guessed to be theProcuratessa Bra. The Marquess, hastening forward, kissed the lady'shand, and turned to summon the actors, who hung back at the farther endof the terrace. The light from the windows and from the lacquey's tapersfell full on the motley band, and Odo, roused to the singularity of hisposition, was about to seek shelter behind the Pantaloon when he heard acry of recognition, and Mirandolina, darting out of the Procuratessa'scircle, fell at that lady's feet with a whispered word.</p> 
<p>　　The Procuratessa at once advanced with a smile of surprise and bade theCavaliere Valsecca welcome. Seeing Odo's embarrassment, she added thathis Highness of Monte Alloro had already apprised her of the cavaliere'scoming, and that she and her husband had the day before despatched amessenger to Venice to enquire if he were already there to invite him tothe villa. At the same moment a middle-aged man with an air of carelesskindly strength emerged from the house and greeted Odo.</p> 
<p>　　"I am happy," said he bowing, "to receive at Bellocchio a member of theprincely house of Pianura; and your excellency will no doubt be aswell-pleased as ourselves that accident enables us to make acquaintancewithout the formalities of an introduction."This, then, was the famous Procuratore Bra, whose house had given threeDoges to Venice, and who was himself regarded as the most powerful ifnot the most scrupulous noble of his day. Odo had heard many tales ofhis singularities, for in a generation of elegant triflers his figurestood out with the ruggedness of a granite boulder in a clipped andgravelled garden. To hereditary wealth and influence he added a love ofpower seconded by great political sagacity and an inflexible will. Ifhis means were not always above suspicion they at least tended tostatesmanlike ends, and in his public capacity he was faithful to thehighest interests of the state. Reports differed as to his private useof his authority. He was noted for his lavish way of living, and for ahospitality which distinguished him from the majority of his class, who,however showy in their establishments, seldom received strangers, andentertained each other only on the most ceremonious occasions. TheProcuratore kept open house both in Venice and on the Brenta, and in hisdrawing-rooms the foreign traveller was welcomed as freely as in Parisor London. Here, too, were to be met the wits, musicians and literatiwhom a traditional morgue still excluded from many aristocratic houses.</p> 
<p>　　Yet in spite of his hospitality (or perhaps because of it) theProcuratore, as Odo knew, was the butt of the very poets he entertained,and the worst satirised man in Venice. It was his misfortune to be inlove with his wife; and this state of mind (in itself sufficientlyridiculous) and the shifts and compromises to which it reduced him, werea source of endless amusement to the humorists. Nor were graver rumourswanting; for it was known that the Procuratore, so proof against otherpersuasions, was helpless in his wife's hands, and that honest men hadbeen undone and scoundrels exalted at a nod of the beautifulProcuratessa. That lady, as famous in her way as her husband, was notedfor quite different qualities; so that, according to one satirist, herhospitality began where his ended, and the Albergo Bra (the nicknametheir palace went by) was advertised in the lampoons of the day asfurnishing both bed and board. In some respects, however, the tastes ofthe noble couple agreed, both delighting in music, wit, good company,and all the adornments of life; while, with regard to their privateconduct, it doubtless suffered by being viewed through the eyes of anarrow and trivial nobility, apt to look with suspicion on any deviationfrom the customs of their class. Such was the household in which Odofound himself unexpectedly included. He learned that his hosts were inthe act of entertaining the English Duke who had captured his burchiellothat morning; and having exchanged his travelling-dress for a moresuitable toilet he was presently conducted to the private theatre wherethe company had gathered to witness an improvised performance byMirandolina and the newly-arrived actors.</p> 
<p>　　The Procuratessa at once beckoned him to the row of gilt armchairs whereshe sat with the noble Duke and several ladies of distinction. Thelittle theatre sparkled with wax-lights reflected in the facets of glasschandeliers and in the jewels of the richly-habited company, and Odo wasstruck by the refined brilliancy of the scene. Before he had time tolook about him the curtains of the stage were drawn back, andMirandolina flashed into view, daring and radiant as ever, and dressedwith an elegance which spoke well for the liberality of her newprotector. She was as much at her ease as before the vulgar audience ofVercelli, and spite of the distinguished eyes fixed upon her, her smilesand sallies were pointedly addressed to Odo. This made him the object ofthe Procuratessa's banter, but had an opposite effect on the Marquess,who fixed him with an irritated eye and fidgeted restlessly in his seatas the performance went on.</p> 
<p>　　When the curtain fell the Procuratessa led the company to the circularsaloon which, as in most villas of the Venetian mainland, formed thecentral point of the house. If Odo had been charmed by the gracefuldecorations of the theatre, he was dazzled by the airy splendour of thisapartment. Dance-music was pouring from the arched recesses above thedoorways, and chandeliers of coloured Murano glass diffused a softbrightness over the pilasters of the stuccoed walls, and the floor ofinlaid marbles on which couples were rapidly forming for thecontradance. His eye, however, was soon drawn from these to the ceilingwhich overarched the dancers with what seemed like an Olympian revelreflected in sunset clouds. Over the gilt balustrade surmounting thecornice lolled the figures of fauns, bacchantes, nereids and tritons,hovered over by a cloud of amorini blown like rose-leaves across a rosysky, while in the centre of the dome Apollo burst in his chariot throughthe mists of dawn, escorted by a fantastic procession of the humanraces. These alien subjects of the sun--a fur-clad Laplander, a turbanedfigure on a dromedary, a blackamoor and a plumed American Indian--werein turn surrounded by a rout of Maenads and Silenuses, whose flushedadvance was checked by the breaking of cool green waves, through whichboys wreathed with coral and seaweed disported themselves among shoalsof flashing dolphins. It was as though the genius of Pleasure had pouredall the riches of his inexhaustible realm on the heads of the revellersbelow.</p> 
<p>　　The Procuratessa brought Odo to earth by remarking that it was amaster-piece of the divine Tiepolo he was admiring. She added that atBellocchio all formalities were dispensed with, and begged him toobserve that, in the rooms opening into the saloon, recreations wereprovided for every taste. In one of these apartments silver trays wereset out with sherbets, cakes, and fruit cooled in snow, while in anotherstood gaming-tables around which the greater number of the company werealready gathering for tresette. A third room was devoted to music; andhither Mirandolina, who was evidently allowed a familiarity ofintercourse not accorded to the other comedians, had withdrawn with thepacified Marquess, and perched on the arm of a high gilt chair waspinching the strings of a guitar and humming the first notes of aboatman's song...</p> 
<p>　　After completing the circuit of the rooms Odo stepped out on theterrace, which was now bathed in the whiteness of a soaring moon. Thecolonnades detached against silver-misted foliage, the gardensspectrally outspread, seemed to enclose him in a magic circle ofloveliness which the first ray of daylight must dispel. He wandered on,drawn to the depths of shade on the lower terraces. The hush grewdeeper, the murmur of the river more mysterious. A yew-arbour invitedhim and he seated himself on the bench niched in its inmost dusk. Seenthrough the black arch of the arbour the moonlight lay like snow onparterres and statues. He thought of Maria Clementina, and of thedelight she would have felt in such a scene as he had just left. Thenthe remembrance of Mirandolina's blandishments stole over him and spiteof himself he smiled at the Marquess's discomfiture. Though he was in nohumour for an intrigue his fancy was not proof against the romance ofhis surroundings, and it seemed to him that Miranda's eyes had neverbeen so bright or her smile so full of provocation. No wonder Frattantofollowed her like a lost soul and the Marquess abandoned Rome andBaalbec to sit at the feet of such a teacher! Had not that lightphilosopher after all chosen the true way and guessed the Sphinx'sriddle? Why should today always be jilted for tomorrow, sensationsacrificed to thought?</p> 
<p>　　As he sat revolving these questions the yew-branches seemed to stir, andfrom some deeper recess of shade a figure stole to his side. He started,but a hand was laid on his lips and he was gently forced back into hisseat. Dazzled by the outer moonlight he could just guess the outline ofthe figure pressed against his own. He sat speechless, yielding to thecharm of the moment, till suddenly he felt a rapid kiss and the visitorvanished as mysteriously as she had come. He sprang up to follow, butinclination failed with his first step. Let the spell of mystery remainunbroken! He sank down on the seat again lulled by dreamy musings...</p> 
<p>　　When he looked up the moonlight had faded and he felt a chill in theair. He walked out on the terrace. The moon hung low and the tree-topswere beginning to tremble. The villa-front was grey, with oblongs ofyellow light marking the windows of the ball-room. As he looked up atit, the dance-music ceased and not a sound was heard but the stir of thefoliage and the murmur of the river against its banks. Then, from aloggia above the central portico, a woman's clear contralto notes tookflight:</p> 
<p>　　Before the yellow dawn is up,With pomp of shield and shaft,Drink we of Night's fast-ebbing cupOne last delicious draught.</p> 
<p>　　The shadowy wine of Night is sweet,With subtle slumbrous fumesCrushed by the Hours' melodious feetFrom bloodless elder-blooms...</p> 
<p>　　The days at Bellocchio passed in a series of festivities. The morningswere spent in drinking chocolate, strolling in the gardens and visitingthe fish-ponds, meanders and other wonders of the villa; thence thegreater number of guests were soon drawn to the card-tables, from whichthey rose only to dine; and after an elaborate dinner prepared by aFrench cook the whole company set out to explore the country or toexchange visits with the hosts of the adjoining villas. Each eveningbrought some fresh diversion: a comedy or an operetta in the miniaturetheatre, an al fresco banquet on the terrace or a ball attended by theprincipal families of the neighbourhood. Odo soon contrived to reassurethe Marquess as to his designs upon Miranda, and when Coeur-Volant wasnot at cards the two young men spent much of their time together. TheMarquess was never tired of extolling the taste and ingenuity with whichthe Venetians planned and carried out their recreations. "Natureherself," said he, "seems the accomplice of their merry-making, and inno other surroundings could man's natural craving for diversion find sograceful and poetic an expression."The scene on which they looked out seemed to confirm his words. It wasthe last evening of their stay at Bellocchio, and the Procuratessa hadplanned a musical festival on the river. Festoons of coloured lanternswound from the portico to the water; and opposite the landing lay theProcuratore's Bucentaur, a great barge hung with crimson velvet. In theprow were stationed the comedians, in airy mythological dress, and asthe guests stepped on board they were received by Miranda, a rosy Venuswho, escorted by Mars and Adonis, recited an ode composed by Cantaprestoin the Procuratessa's honour. A banquet was spread in the deck-house,which was hung with silk arras and Venetian mirrors, and, while theguests feasted, dozens of little boats hung with lights and filled withmusicians flitted about the Bucentaur like a swarm of musicalfireflies...</p> 
<p>　　The next day Odo accompanied the Procuratessa to Venice. Had he been atraveller from beyond the Alps he could hardly have been more unpreparedfor the spectacle that awaited him. In aspect and customs Venicediffered almost as much from other Italian cities as from those of therest of Europe. From the fanciful stone embroidery of her churches andpalaces to a hundred singularities in dress and manners--thefull-bottomed wigs and long gowns of the nobles, the black mantles andhead-draperies of the ladies, the white masks worn abroad by both sexes,the publicity of social life under the arcades of the Piazza, theextraordinary freedom of intercourse in the casini, gaming-rooms andtheatres--the city proclaimed, in every detail of life and architecture,her independence of any tradition but her own. This was the moresingular as Saint Mark's square had for centuries been the meeting-placeof East and West, and the goal of artists, scholars and pleasure-seekersfrom all parts of the world. Indeed, as Coeur-Volant pointed out, theVenetian customs almost appeared to have been devised for theconvenience of strangers. The privilege of going masked at almost allseasons and the enforced uniformity of dress, which in itself provided akind of incognito, made the place singularly favourable to every kind ofintrigue and amusement; while the mild temper of the people and thewatchfulness of the police prevented the public disorders that suchlicense might have occasioned. These seeming anomalies abounded on everyside. From the gaming-table where a tinker might set a ducat against aprince it was but a few steps to the Broglio, or arcade under the ducalpalace, into which no plebeian might intrude while the nobility walkedthere. The great ladies, who were subject to strict sumptuary laws, andmight not display their jewels or try the new French fashions but on thesly, were yet privileged at all hours to go abroad alone in theirgondolas. No society was more haughty and exclusive in its traditions,yet the mask leveled all classes and permitted, during the greater partof the year, an equality of intercourse undreamed of in other cities;while the nobles, though more magnificently housed than in any othercapital of Europe, generally sought amusement at the public casini orassembly-rooms instead of receiving company in their own palaces. Suchwere but a few of the contradictions in a city where the theatres werenamed after the neighbouring churches, where there were innumerablereligious foundations but scarce an ecclesiastic to be met in company,and where the ladies of the laity dressed like nuns, while the nuns inthe aristocratic convents went in gala habits and with uncovered heads.</p> 
<p>　　No wonder that to the bewildered stranger the Venetians seemed to keepperpetual carnival and Venice herself to be as it were the mere stage ofsome huge comic interlude.</p> 
<p>　　To Odo the setting was even more astonishing than the performance. Neverhad he seen pleasure and grace so happily allied, all the arts of lifeso combined in the single effort after enjoyment. Here was not a meretendency to linger on the surface, but the essence of superficialityitself; not an ignoring of what lies beneath, but an elimination of it;as though all human experience should be beaten thin and spread outbefore the eye like some brilliant tenuous plaque of Etruscan gold. Andin this science of pleasure--mere jeweller's work though it were--thegreatest artists had collaborated, each contributing his page to thephilosophy of enjoyment in the form of some radiant allegory floweringfrom palace wall or ceiling like the enlarged reflection of the lifebeneath it. Nowhere was the mind arrested by a question or an idea.</p> 
<p>　　Thought slunk away like an unmasked guest at the ridotto. Sensationruled supreme, and each moment was an iridescent bubble fresh-blown fromthe lips of fancy.</p> 
<p>　　Odo brought to the spectacle the humour best fitted for its enjoyment.</p> 
<p>　　His weariness and discouragement sought refuge in the emotionalsatisfaction of the hour. Here at least the old problem of living hadbeen solved, and from the patrician taking the air in his gondola to thegondolier himself, gambling and singing on the water-steps of hismaster's palace, all seemed equally satisfied with the solution. Now ifever was the time to cry "halt!" to the present, to forget the travelledroad and take no thought for the morrow...</p> 
<p>　　The months passed rapidly and agreeably. The Procuratessa was the mostamiable of guides, and in her company Odo enjoyed the best that Venicehad to offer, from the matchless music of the churches and hospitals tothe petits soupers in the private casini of the nobility; whileCoeur-Volant and Castelrovinato introduced him to scenes where even alady of the Procuratessa's intrepidity might not venture.</p> 
<p>　　Such a life left little time for thoughtful pleasures; nor did Odo findin the society about him any sympathy with his more personal tastes. Atfirst he yielded willingly enough to the pressure of his surroundings,glad to escape from thoughts of the past and speculations about thefuture; but it was impossible for him to lose his footing in such anelement, and at times he felt the lack of such companionship as deCrucis had given him. There was no society in Venice corresponding withthe polished circles of Milan or Naples, or with the academic class insuch University towns as Padua and Pavia. The few Venetians destined tobe remembered among those who had contributed to the intellectualadvancement of Italy vegetated in obscurity, suffering not so much fromreligious persecution--for the Inquisition had little power inVenice--as from the incorrigible indifference of a society which ignoredall who did not contribute to its amusement. Odo indeed might havesought out these unhonoured prophets, but that all the influences abouthim set the other way, and that he was falling more and more into thehabit of running with the tide. Now and then, however, a vague ennuidrove him to one of the bookshops which, throughout Italy were the chiefmeeting-places of students and authors. On one of these occasions thedealer invited him into a private room where he kept some rare volumes,and here Odo was surprised to meet Andreoni, the liberal bookseller ofPianura.</p> 
<p>　　Andreoni at first seemed somewhat disconcerted by the meeting; butpresently recovering his confidence, he told Odo that he had beenrecently banished from Pianura, the cause of his banishment being thepublication of a book on taxation that was supposed to reflect on thefiscal system of the duchy. Though he did not name the author, Odo atonce suspected Gamba; but on his enquiring if the latter had also beenbanished, Andreoni merely replied that he had been dismissed from hispost, and had left Pianura. The bookseller went on to say that he hadcome to Venice with the idea of setting up his press either there or inPadua, where his wife's family lived. Odo was eager to hear more; butAndreoni courteously declined to wait on him at his lodgings, on theplea that it might harm them both to be seen together. They agreed,however, to meet in San Zaccaria after low mass the next morning, andhere Andreoni gave Odo a fuller report of recent events in the duchy.</p> 
<p>　　It appeared that in the incessant see-saw of party influences the Churchhad once more gained on the liberals. Trescorre was out of favour, theDominican had begun to show his hand more openly, and the Duke, morethan ever apprehensive about his health, was seeking to conciliateheaven by his renewed persecution of the reformers. In the generalupheaval even Crescenti had nearly lost his place; and it was rumouredthat he kept it only through the intervention of the Pope, who hadrepresented to the Duke that the persecution of a scholar already famousthroughout Europe would reflect little credit on the Church.</p> 
<p>　　As for Gamba, Andreoni, though unwilling to admit a knowledge of hisexact whereabouts, assured Odo that he was well and had not lostcourage. At court matters remained much as usual. The Duchess,surrounded by her familiars, had entered on a new phase of madexpenditure, draining the exchequer to indulge her private whims,filling her apartments with mountebanks and players, and borrowing fromcourtiers and servants to keep her creditors from the door. Trescorrewas no longer able to check her extravagance, and his influence with theDuke being on the wane, the court was once more the scene of unseemlyscandals and disorders.</p> 
<p>　　The only new figure to appear there since Odo's departure was that ofthe little prince's governor, who had come from Rome a few monthspreviously to superintend the heir's education, which was found to havebeen grievously neglected under his former masters. This was anecclesiastic, an ex-Jesuit as some said, but without doubt a man ofparts, and apparently of more tolerant views than the other churchmenabout the court.</p> 
<p>　　"But," Andreoni added, "your excellency may chance to recall him; for heis the same abate de Crucis who was sent to Pianura by the Holy Officeto arrest the German astrologer."Odo heard him with surprise. He had had no news of de Crucis since theirparting in Rome, where, as he supposed, the latter was to remain forsome years in the service of Prince Bracciano. Odo was at a loss toconceive how or why the Jesuit had come to Pianura; but, whatever hisreasons for being there, it was certain that his influence must makeitself felt far beyond the range of his immediate duties. Whether thisinfluence would be exerted for good or ill it was impossible toforecast; but much as Odo admired de Crucis, he could not forget thatthe Jesuit, by his own avowal, was still the servant of the greatestorganised opposition to moral and intellectual freedom that the worldhad ever known. That this opposition was not always actively manifestedOdo was well aware. He knew that the Jesuit spirit moved in manydirections and that its action was often more beneficial than that ofits opponents; but it remained an incalculable element in thecomposition of human affairs, and one the more to be feared since, inceasing to have a material existence, it had acquired the dreadpervasiveness of an idea.</p> 
<p>　　With the Epiphany the wild carnival-season set in. Nothing could surpassthe excesses of this mad time. All classes seemed bitten by thetarantula of mirth, every gondola hid an intrigue, the patrician'stabarro concealed a noble lady, the feminine hood and cloak a youngspark bent on mystification, the friar's habit a man of pleasure and thenun's veil a lady of the town. The Piazza swarmed with merry-makers ofall degrees. The square itself was taken up by the booths of hucksters,rope-dancers and astrologers, while promenaders in travesty thronged thearcades, and the ladies of the nobility, in their white masks and blackzendaletti, surveyed the scene from the windows of the assembly-rooms inthe Procuratie, or, threading the crowd on the arms of their gallants,visited the various peep-shows and flocked about the rhinocerosexhibited in a great canvas tent in the Piazzetta. The characteristiccontrasts of Venetian life seemed to be emphasised by the vagaries ofthe carnival, and Odo never ceased to be diverted by the sight of a longline of masqueraders in every kind of comic disguise kneeling devoutlybefore the brilliantly-lit shrine of the Virgin under the arches of theProcuratie, while the friar who led their devotions interrupted hislitany whenever the quack on an adjoining platform began to bawl througha tin trumpet the praise of his miraculous pills.</p> 
<p>　　The mounting madness culminated on Giovedi Grasso, the last Thursdaybefore Lent, when the Piazzetta became the scene of ceremonies in whichthe Doge himself took part. These opened with the decapitation of threebulls: a rite said to commemorate some long-forgotten dispute betweenthe inveterate enemies, Venice and Aquileia. The bulls, preceded byhalberdiers and trumpeters, and surrounded by armed attendants, were ledin state before the ducal palace, and the executioner, practised in hisbloody work, struck off each head with a single stroke of his hugesword. This slaughter was succeeded by pleasanter sights, such as thefamous Vola, or flight of a boy from the bell-tower of Saint Mark's to awindow of the palace, where he presented a nosegay to his Serenity andwas caught up again to his airy vaulting-ground. After this ingeniousfeat came another called the "Force of Hercules," given by a band ofyouths who, building themselves into a kind of pyramid, shifted theirpostures with inexhaustible agility, while bursts of fireworks woveyellow arches through the midday light. Meanwhile the crowds in thestreets fled this way and that as a throng of uproarious young fellowsdrove before them the bulls that were to be baited in the open squares;and wherever a recessed doorway or the angle of a building affordedshelter from the rout, some posture-maker or ballad-singer had gathereda crowd about his carpet.</p> 
<p>　　Ash Wednesday brought about a dramatic transformation. Every travestylaid aside, every tent and stall swept away, the people again gatheredin the Piazza to receive the ashes of penitence on their heads, thechurches now became the chief centres of interest. Venice was noted forher sacred music and for the lavish illumination of her favouriteshrines and chapels; and few religious spectacles were more impressivethan the Forty Hours' devotion in the wealthier churches of the city.</p> 
<p>　　All the magic of music, painting and sculpture were combined in theservice of religion, and Odo's sense of the dramatic quality of theCatholic rites found gratification in the moving scenes where, amid theimperishable splendours of his own creation, man owned himself but dust.</p> 
<p>　　Never before had he been so alive to the symbolism of the penitentialseason, so awed by the beauty and symmetry of that great structure ofthe Liturgical Year that leads the soul up, step by step, to the awfulheights of Calvary. The very carelessness of those about him seemed todeepen the solemnity of the scenes enacted--as though the Church, afterall her centuries of dominion, were still, as in those early days, but avoice crying in the wilderness.</p> 
<p>　　The Easter bells ushered in the reign of another spirit. If the carnivalfolly was spent, the joy of returning life replaced it. After the winterdiversions of cards, concerts and theatres, came the excursions to theisland-gardens of the lagoon and the evening promenade of the fresca onthe Grand Canal. Now the palace-windows were hung with awnings, theoleanders in the balconies grew rosy against the sea-worn marble, andyellow snap-dragons blossomed from the crumbling walls. The market-boatsbrought early fruits and vegetables from the Brenta and roses andgilly-flowers from the Paduan gardens; and when the wind set from shoreit carried with it the scent of lime-blossoms and flowering fields. Nowalso was the season when the great civic and religious processions tookplace, dyeing the water with sunset hues as they swept from the steps ofthe Piazzetta to San Giorgio, the Redentore or the Salute. In thefashionable convents the nuns celebrated the festivals of their patronsaints with musical and dramatic entertainments to which secularvisitors were invited. These entertainments were a noted feature ofVenetian life, and the subject of much scandalous comment among visitorsfrom beyond the Alps. The nuns of the stricter orders were as closelycloistered as elsewhere; but in the convents of Santa Croce, SantaChiara, and a few others, mostly filled by the daughters of thenobility, an unusual liberty prevailed. It was known that the inmateshad taken the veil for family reasons, and to the indulgent Venetiantemper it seemed natural that their seclusion should be made as littleirksome as possible. As a rule the privileges accorded to the nunsconsisted merely in their being allowed to receive visits in thepresence of a lay-sister, and to perform in concerts on the feast-daysof the order; but some few convents had a name for far greater license,and it was a common thing for the noble libertine returned from Italy toboast of his intrigue with a Venetian nun.</p> 
<p>　　Odo, in the Procuratessa's train, had of course visited many of theprincipal convents. Whether it were owing to the malicious pleasure ofcontrasting their own state with that of their cloistered sisters, or tothe discreet shelter which the parlour afforded to their privateintrigues, the Venetian ladies were exceedingly partial to these visits.</p> 
<p>　　The Procuratessa was no exception to the rule, and as was natural to oneof her complexion, she preferred the convents where the greatest freedomprevailed. Odo, however, had hitherto found little to tempt him in theseglimpses of forbidden fruit. The nuns, though often young and pretty,had the insipidity of women secluded from the passions and sorrows oflife without being raised above them; and he preferred the frankcoarseness of the Procuratessa's circle to the simpering graces of thecloister.</p> 
<p>　　Even Coeur-Volant's mysterious boast of a conquest he had made among thesisters failed to excite his friend's curiosity. The Marquess, thoughstill devoted to Miranda, was too much the child of his race not to seekvariety in his emotions; indeed he often declared that the one fault ofthe Italian character was its unimaginative fidelity in love-affairs.</p> 
<p>　　"Does a man," he asked, "dine off one dish at a gourmet's banquet? Andwhy should I restrict myself to one course at the most richly-spreadtable in Europe? One must love at least two women to appreciate either;and, did the silly creatures but know it, a rival becomes them like apatch."Sister Mary of the Crucifix, he went on to explain, possessed the veryqualities that Miranda lacked. The daughter of a rich nobleman ofTreviso, she was skilled in music, drawing and all the operations of theneedle, and was early promised in marriage to a young man whose estatesadjoined her father's. The jealousy of a younger sister, who wassecretly in love with the suitor, caused her to accuse Coeur-Volant'smistress of misconduct and thus broke off the marriage; and the unhappygirl, repudiated by her bridegroom, was at once despatched to a conventin Venice. Enraged at her fate, she had repeatedly appealed to theauthorities to release her; but her father's wealth and influenceprevailed against all her efforts. The abbess, however, felt such pityfor her that she was allowed more freedom than the other nuns, with whomher wit and beauty made her a favourite in spite of her exceptionalprivileges. These, as Coeur-Volant hinted, included the liberty ofleaving the convent after night-fall to visit her friends; and heprofessed to be one of those whom she had thus honoured. Always eager tohave his good taste ratified by the envy of his friends, he was urgentwith Odo to make the lady's acquaintance, and it was agreed that, on thefirst favourable occasion, a meeting should take place at Coeur-Volant'scasino. The weeks elapsed, however, without Odo's hearing further of thematter, and it had nearly passed from his mind when one August day hereceived word that the Marquess hoped for his company that evening.</p> 
<p>　　He was in that mood of careless acquiescence when any novelty invites,and the heavy warmth of the summer night seemed the accomplice of hishumour. Cloaked and masked, he stepped into his gondola and was sweptrapidly along the Grand Canal and through winding channels to theGiudecca. It was close on midnight and all Venice was abroad. Gondolasladen with musicians and hung with coloured lamps lay beneath the palacewindows or drifted out on the oily reaches of the lagoon. There was nomoon, and the side-canals were dark and noiseless but for the hundredsof caged nightingales that made every byway musical. As his prow slippedpast garden walls and under the blackness of low-ached bridges Odo feltthe fathomless mystery of the Venetian night: not the open night of thelagoons, but the secret dusk of nameless waterways between blind windowsand complaisant gates.</p> 
<p>　　At one of these his gondola presently touched. The gate was cautiouslyunbarred and Odo found himself in a strip of garden preceding a lowpavilion in which not a light was visible. A woman-servant led himindoors and the Marquess greeted him on the threshold.</p> 
<p>　　"You are late!" he exclaimed. "I began to fear you would not be here toreceive our guests with me.""Your guests?" Odo repeated. "I had fancied there was but one."The Marquess smiled. "My dear Mary of the Crucifix," he said, "is toowell-born to venture out alone at this late hour, and has prevailed onher bosom friend to accompany her.--Besides," he added with hisdeprecating shrug, "I own I have had too recent an experience of yoursuccess to trust you alone with my enchantress; and she has promised tobring the most fascinating nun in the convent to protect her from yourwiles."As he spoke he led Odo into a room furnished in the luxurious style of aFrench boudoir. A Savonnerie carpet covered the floor, the lounges andeasy-chairs were heaped with cushions, and the panels hung with pasteldrawings of a lively or sentimental character. The windows toward thegarden were close-shuttered, but those on the farther side of the roomstood open on a starlit terrace whence the eye looked out over thelagoon to the outer line of islands.</p> 
<p>　　"Confess," cried Coeur-Volant, pointing to a table set with delicaciesand flanked by silver wine-coolers, "that I have spared no pains to domy goddess honour and that this interior must present an agreeablecontrast to the whitewashed cells and dismal refectory of her convent!</p> 
<p>　　No passion," he continued, with his quaint didactic air, "is sosusceptible as love to the influence of its surroundings; and principleswhich might have held out against a horse-hair sofa and soupe a l'oignonhave before now been known to succumb to silk cushions and champagne."He received with perfect good-humour the retort that if he failed in hisdesigns his cook and his upholsterer would not be to blame; and theyoung men were still engaged in such banter when the servant returned tosay that a gondola was at the water-gate. The Marquess hastened out andpresently reappeared with two masked and hooded figures. The first ofthese, whom he led by the hand, entered with the air of one notunaccustomed to her surroundings; but the other hung back, and on theMarquess's inviting them to unmask, hurriedly signed to her friend torefuse.</p> 
<p>　　"Very well, fair strangers," said Coeur-Volant with a laugh; "if youinsist on prolonging our suspense we shall avenge ourselves byprolonging yours, and neither my friend nor I will unmask till you arepleased to set us the example."The first lady echoed his laugh. "Shall I own," she cried, "that Isuspect in this unflattering compliance a pretext to conceal yourfriend's features from me as long as possible? For my part," shecontinued, throwing back her hood, "the mask of hypocrisy I am compelledto wear in the convent makes me hate every form of disguise, and withall my defects I prefer to be known as I am." And with that she detachedher mask and dropped the cloak from her shoulders.</p> 
<p>　　The gesture revealed a beauty of the laughing sensuous type best suitedto such surroundings. Sister Mary of the Crucifix, in her sumptuous gownof shot-silk, with pearls wound through her reddish hair and hanging onher bare shoulders, might have stepped from some festal canvas ofBonifazio's. She had laid aside even the light gauze veil worn by thenuns in gala habit, and no vestige of her calling showed itself in dressor bearing.</p> 
<p>　　"Do you accept my challenge, cavaliere?" she exclaimed, turning on Odo aglance confident of victory.</p> 
<p>　　The Marquess meanwhile had approached the other nun with the intentionof inducing her to unmask; but as Sister Mary of the Crucifix advancedto perform the same service for his friend, his irrepressible jealousymade him step hastily between them.</p> 
<p>　　"Come cavaliere," he cried, drawing Odo gaily toward the unknown nun,"since you have induced one of our fair guests to unmask perhaps you maybe equally successful with the other, who appears provokinglyindifferent to my advances."The masked nun had in fact retreated to a corner of the room and stoodthere, drawing her cloak about her, rather in the attitude of afrightened child than in that of a lady bent on a gallant adventure.</p> 
<p>　　Sister Mary of the Crucifix approached her playfully. "My dear SisterVeronica," said she, throwing her arm about the other's neck, "hesitatesto reveal charms which she knows must cast mine in the shade; but I amnot to be outdone in generosity, and if the Marquess will unmask hisfriend I will do the same by mine."As she spoke she deftly pinioned the nun's hands and snatched off hermask with a malicious laugh. The Marquess, entering into her humour,removed Odo's at the same instant, and the latter, turning with a laugh,found himself face to face with Fulvia Vivaldi. He grew white, and Maryof the Crucifix sprang forward to catch her friend.</p> 
<p>　　"Good God! What is this?" gasped the Marquess, staring from one to theother.</p> 
<p>　　A glance of entreaty from Fulvia checked the answer on Odo's lips, andfor a moment there was silence in the room; then Fulvia, breaking awayfrom her companion, fled out on the terrace. The other was about tofollow; but Odo, controlling himself, stepped between them.</p> 
<p>　　"Madam," said he in a low voice, "I recognise in your companion a friendof whom I have long had no word. Will you pardon me if I speak with heralone?"Sister Mary drew back with a meaning sparkle in her handsome eyes. "Why,this," she cried, not without a touch of resentment, "is the prettiestending imaginable; but what a sly creature, to be sure, to make me thinkit was her first assignation!"Odo, without answering, hastened out on the terrace. It was so darkafter the brightly lit room that for a moment he did not distinguish thefigure which had sprung to the low parapet above the water; and hestumbled forward just in time to snatch Fulvia back to safety.</p> 
<p>　　"This is madness!" he cried, as she hung upon him trembling.</p> 
<p>　　"The boat," she stammered in a strange sobbing voice--"the boat shouldbe somewhere below--""The boat lies at the water-gate on the other side," he answered.</p> 
<p>　　She drew away from him with a gesture of despair. The struggle withSister Mary had disordered her hair and it fell on her white neck inloosened strands. "My cloak--my mask--" she faltered vaguely, claspingher hands across her bosom; then suddenly dropped to a seat and burstinto tears. Once before--but in how different a case!--he had seen herthus thrilled with weeping. Then fate had thrown him humbled at herfeet, now it was she who cried him mercy in every line of her bowed headand shaken breast; and the thought of that other meeting flooded hisheart with pity.</p> 
<p>　　He knelt before her, seeking her hands. "Fulvia, why do you shrink fromme?" he whispered. But she shook her head and wept on.</p> 
<p>　　At last her sobs subsided and she rose to her feet. "I must go back,"said she in a low tone, and would have passed him.</p> 
<p>　　"Back? To the convent?""To the convent," she said after him; but she made no farther effort tomove.</p> 
<p>　　The question that tortured him sprang forth. "You have taken the vows?""A month since," she answered.</p> 
<p>　　He hid his face in his hands and for a moment both were silent. "And youhave no other word for me--none?" he faltered at last.</p> 
<p>　　She fixed him with a hard bright stare. "Yes--one," she cried; "keep aplace for me among your gallant recollections.""Fulvia!" he said with sudden strength, and caught her by the arm.</p> 
<p>　　"Let me pass!" she cried.</p> 
<p>　　"No, by heaven!" he retorted; "not till you listen to me--not till youtell me how it is that I come upon you here!--Ah, child," he broke out,"do you fancy I don't see how little you belong in such scenes? That Idon't know you are here through some dreadful error? Fulvia," hepleaded, "will you never trust me?" And at the word he burned withblushes in the darkness.</p> 
<p>　　His voice, perhaps, rather than what he said, seemed to have struck ayielding fibre. He felt her arm tremble in his hold; but after a momentshe said with cruel distinctness: "There was no error. I came knowingly.</p> 
<p>　　It was the company and not the place I was deceived in."Odo drew back with a start; then, as if in spite of himself, he brokeinto a laugh. "By the saints," said he, almost joyously, "I am sorry tobe where I am not wanted; but since no better company offers, will younot make the best of mine and suffer me to hand you in to supper withour friends?" And with a low bow he offered her his arm.</p> 
<p>　　The effect was instantaneous. He saw her catch at the balustrade forsupport.</p> 
<p>　　"Sancta simplicitas!" he exulted, "and did you think to play the part atsuch short notice?" He fell at her feet and covered her hands withkisses. "My Fulvia! My poor child! come with me, come away from here,"he entreated. "I know not what mad hazard has brought us thus together,but I thank God on my knees for the encounter. You shall tell me all ornothing, as you please--you shall presently dismiss me at yourconvent-gate, and never see me again if you so will it--but till then, Iswear, you are in my charge, and no human power shall come between us!"As he ended the Marquess's voice called gaily through the open window:</p> 
<p>　　"Friends, the burgundy is uncorked! Will you not join us in a glass ofgood French wine?"Fulvia flung herself upon Odo. "Yes--yes; away--take me away from here!"she cried, clinging to him. She had gathered her cloak about her anddrawn the hood over her disordered hair. "Away! Away!" she repeated. "Icannot see them again. Good God, is there no other way out?"With a gesture he warned her to be silent and drew her along the terracein the shadow of the house. The gravel creaked beneath their feet, andshe shook at the least sound; but her hand lay in his like a child's andhe felt himself her master. At the farther end of the terrace a flightof steps led to a narrow strip of shore. He helped her down and afterlistening a moment gave a whistle. Presently they heard a low plash ofoars and saw the prow of a gondola cautiously rounding the angle of theterrace. The water was shallow and the boatmen proceeded slowly and atlength paused a few yards from the land.</p> 
<p>　　"We can come no nearer," one of them called; "what is it?""Your mistress is unwell and wishes to return," Odo answered; andcatching Fulvia in his arms he waded out with her to the gondola andlifted her over the side. "To Santa Chiara!" he ordered, as he laid heron the cushions beneath the felze; and the boatmen, recognising her asone of their late fares, without more ado began to row rapidly towardthe city.</p>
