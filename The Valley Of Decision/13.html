His house was the meeting-place of a societycalling itself of the Honey-Bees and ostensibly devoted to the study ofthe classical poets, from whose pages the members were supposed to cullmellifluous nourishment; but under this guise the so-called literati hadfor some time indulged in free discussion of religious and scientificquestions. The Academy of the Honey-Bees comprised among its members allthe independent thinkers of Turin: doctors of law, of philosophy andmedicine, chemists, philologists and naturalists, with one or twomembers of the nobility, who, like Alfieri, felt, or affected, aninterest in the graver problems of life, and could be trusted not tobetray the true character of the association.</p> 
<p>　　These details Odo learned the next day from Alfieri; who went on to saythat, owing to the increased vigilance of the government, and to thebanishment of several distinguished men accused by the Church ofheretical or seditious opinions, the Honey-Bees had of late been obligedto hold their meetings secretly, it being even rumoured that Vivaldi,who was their president, had resigned his professorship and withdrawnbehind the shelter of literary employment in order to elude theobservation of the authorities. Men had not yet forgotten the fate ofthe Neapolitan historian, Pietro Giannone, who for daring to attack thecensorship and the growth of the temporal power had been driven fromNaples to Vienna, from Vienna back to Venice, and at length, at theprompting of the Holy See, lured across the Piedmontese frontier byCharles Emmanuel of Savoy, and imprisoned for life in the citadel ofTurin. The memory of his tragic history--most of all, perhaps, of hisrecantation and the "devout ending" to which solitude and persecutionhad forced the freest spirit of his day--hovered like a warning on thehorizon of thought and constrained political speculation to hide itselfbehind the study of fashionable trifles. Alfieri had lately joined theassociation of the Honey-Bees, and the Professor, at his suggestion, hadinvited Odo, for whose discretion his friend declared himself ready toanswer. The Honey-Bees were in fact desirous of attracting young men ofrank who felt an interest in scientific or economic problems; for it washoped that in this manner the new ideas might imperceptibly permeate theclass whose privileges and traditions presented the chief obstacle toreform. In France, it was whispered, free-thinkers and politicalagitators were the honoured guests of the nobility, who eagerly embracedtheir theories and applied them to the remedy of social abuses. Only bysimilar means could the ideals of the Piedmontese reformers be realised;and in those early days of universal illusion none appeared to suspectthe danger of arming inexperienced hands with untried weapons. Utopiawas already in sight; and all the world was setting out for it as forsome heavenly picnic ground.</p> 
<p>　　Of Vivaldi himself, Alfieri spoke with extravagant admiration. Hisaffable exterior was said to conceal the moral courage of one ofPlutarch's heroes. He was a man after the antique pattern, ready to laydown fortune, credit and freedom in the defence of his convictions. "AnAgamemnon," Alfieri exclaimed, "who would not hesitate to sacrifice hisdaughter to obtain a favourable wind for his enterprise!"The metaphor was perhaps scarcely to Odo's taste; but at least it gavehim the chance for which he had waited. "And the daughter?" he asked.</p> 
<p>　　"The lovely doctoress?" said Alfieri carelessly. "Oh, she's one of yourprodigies of female learning, such as our topsy-turvy land produces: anincipient Laura Bassi or Gaetana Agnesi, to name the most distinguishedof their tribe; though I believe that hitherto her father's good senseor her own has kept her from aspiring to academic honours. The beautifulFulvia is a good daughter, and devotes herself, I'm told, to helpingVivaldi in his work; a far more becoming employment for one of her ageand sex than defending Latin theses before a crew of ribald students."In this Odo was of one mind with him; for though Italy was used to thespectacle of the Improvisatrice and the female doctor of philosophy, itis doubtful if the character was one in which any admirer cared to seehis divinity figure. Odo, at any rate, felt a distinct satisfaction inlearning that Fulvia Vivaldi had thus far made no public display of herlearning. How much pleasanter to picture her as her father's aid,perhaps a sharer in his dreams: a vestal cherishing the flame of Libertyin the secret sanctuary of the goddess! He scarce knew as yet of whathis feeling for the girl was compounded. The sentiment she had rousedwas one for which his experience had no name: an emotion in which awemingled with an almost boyish sense of fellowship, sex as yet lurkingout of sight as in some hidden ambush. It was perhaps her associationwith a world so unfamiliar and alluring that lent her for the moment hergreatest charm. Odo's imagination had been profoundly stirred by what hehad heard and seen at the meeting of the Honey-Bees. That impatiencewith the vanity of his own pursuits and with the injustice of existingconditions, which hovered like a phantom at the feast of life, had atlast found form and utterance. Parini's satires and the bitter mockeryof the "Frusta Letteraria" were but instruments of demolition; but thearguments of the Professor's friends had that constructive quality soappealing to the urgent temper of youth. Was the world in ruins? Thenhere was a plan to rebuild it. Was humanity in chains? Behold the angelon the threshold of the prison!</p> 
<p>　　Odo, too impatient to await the next reunion of the Honey-Bees, soughtout and frequented those among the members whose conversation hadchiefly attracted him. They were grave men, of studious and retiringhabit, leading the frugal life of the Italian middle-class, a life indignified contrast to the wasteful and aimless existence of thenobility. Odo's sensitiveness to outward impressions made him peculiarlyalive to this contrast. None was more open than he to the seducements ofluxurious living, the polish of manners, the tacit exclusion of all thatis ugly or distressing; but it seemed to him that fine living should bebut the flower of fine feeling, and that such external graces, when theyadorned a dull and vapid society, were as incongruous as the royalpurple on a clown. Among certain of his new friends he found aclumsiness of manner somewhat absurdly allied with an attempt at Romanausterity; but he was fair-minded enough to see that the middle-classdoctor or lawyer who tries to play the Cicero is, after all, a morerespectable figure than the Marquess who apes Caligula or Commodus.</p> 
<p>　　Still, his lurking dilettantism made him doubly alive to the elegance ofthe Palazzo Tournanches when he went thither from a coarse meal in thestuffy dining-parlour of one of his new acquaintances; as he neverrelished the discourse of the latter more than after an afternoon in thesociety of the Countess's parasites.</p> 
<p>　　Alfieri's allusions to the learned ladies for whom Italy was noted madeOdo curious to meet the wives and daughters of his new friends; for heknew it was only in their class that women received something more thanthe ordinary conventual education; and he felt a secret desire tocompare Fulvia Vivaldi with other young girls of her kind. Learnedladies he met, indeed; for though the women-folk of some of thephilosophers were content to cook and darn for them (and perhapssecretly burn a candle in their behalf to Saint Thomas Aquinas or SaintDominick, refuters of heresy), there were others who aspired to all thehonours of scholarship, and would order about their servant-girls inTuscan, and scold their babies in Ciceronian Latin. Among these fairgrammarians, however, he met none that wore her learning lightly. Theywere forever tripping in the folds of their doctors' gowns, anddelivering their most trivial views ex cathedra; and too often the poorphilosophers, their lords and fathers, cowered under their harangueslike frightened boys under the tongue of a schoolmaster.</p> 
<p>　　It was in fact only in the household of Orazio Vivaldi that Odo foundthe simplicity and grace of living for which he longed. Alfieri hadwarned him not to visit the Professor too often, since the latter, beingunder observation, might be compromised by the assiduity of his friends.</p> 
<p>　　Odo therefore waited for some days before presenting himself, and whenhe did so it was at the angelus, when the streets were crowded and aman's comings and goings the less likely to be marked. He found Vivaldireading with his daughter in the long library where the Honey-Bees heldtheir meetings; but Fulvia at once withdrew, nor did she show herselfagain during Odo's visit. It was clear that, proud of her as Vivaldiwas, he had no wish to parade her attainments, and that in her dailylife she maintained the Italian habit of seclusion; but to Odo she waseverywhere present in the quiet room with its well-ordered books andcuriosities, and the scent of flowers rising through the shutteredwindows. He was sensible of an influence permeating even the inanimateobjects about him, so that they seemed to reflect the spirit of thosewho dwelt there. No room had given him this sense of companionship sincehe had spent his boyish holidays in the old Count Benedetto'sapartments; but it was of another, intangible world that his presentsurroundings spoke. Vivaldi received him kindly and asked him to repeathis visit; and Odo returned as often as he thought prudent.</p> 
<p>　　The Professor's conversation engaged him deeply. Vivaldi's familiaritywith French speculative literature, and with its sources in theexperiential philosophy of the English school, gave Odo his first clearconception of the origin and tendency of the new movement. Thiscoordination of scattered ideas was aided by his readings in theEncyclopaedia, which, though placed on the Index in Piedmont, was to befound behind the concealed panels of more than one private library. Fromhis talks with Alfieri, and from the pages of Plutarch, he had gained acertain insight into the Stoical view of reason as the measure ofconduct, and of the inherent sufficiency of virtue as its own end. Henow learned that all about him men were endeavouring to restore thehuman spirit to that lost conception of its dignity; and he longed tojoin the band of new crusaders who had set out to recover the tomb oftruth from the forces of superstition. The distinguishing mark ofeighteenth-century philosophy was its eagerness to convert itsacquisitions in every branch of knowledge into instruments of practicalbeneficence; and this quality appealed peculiarly to Odo, who had everbeen moved by abstract theories only as they explained or modified thedestiny of man. Vivaldi, pleased by his new pupil's eagerness to learn,took pains to set before him this aspect of the struggle.</p> 
<p>　　"You will now see," he said, after one of their long talks about theEncyclopaedists, "why we who have at heart the mental and socialregeneration of our countrymen are so desirous of making a concertedeffort against the established system. It is only by united action thatwe can prevail. The bravest mob of independent fighters has littlechance against a handful of disciplined soldiers, and the Church isperfectly logical in seeing her chief danger in the Encyclopaedia'ssystematised marshalling of scattered truths. As long as the attacks onher authority were isolated, and as it were sporadic, she had little tofear even from the assaults of genius; but the most ordinary intellectmay find a use and become a power in the ranks of an organisedopposition. Seneca tells us the slaves in ancient Rome were at one timeso numerous that the government prohibited their wearing a distinctivedress lest they should learn their strength and discover that the citywas in their power; and the Church knows that when the countless spiritsshe has enslaved without subduing have once learned their number andefficiency they will hold her doctrines at their mercy.--The Churchagain," he continued, "has proved her astuteness in making faith thegift of grace and not the result of reason. By so doing she placedherself in a position which was well-nigh impregnable till the school ofNewton substituted observation for intuition and his followers showedwith increasing clearness the inability of the human mind to apprehendanything outside the range of experience. The ultimate claim of theChurch rests on the hypothesis of an intuitive faculty in man. Disprovethe existence of this faculty, and reason must remain the supreme testof truth. Against reason the fabric of theological doctrine cannot longhold out, and the Church's doctrinal authority once shaken, men will nolonger fear to test by ordinary rules the practical results of herteaching. We have not joined the great army of truth to waste our timein vain disputations over metaphysical subtleties. Our aim is, byfreeing the mind of man from superstition to relieve him from thepractical abuses it entails. As it is impossible to examine any fiscalor industrial problem without discovering that the chief obstacle toimprovement lies in the Church's countless privileges and exemptions, soin every department of human activity we find some inveterate wrongtaking shelter under the claim of a divinely-revealed authority. Thisclaim demolished, the stagnant current of human progress will soon burstits barriers and set with a mighty rush toward the wide ocean of truthand freedom..."That general belief in the perfectibility of man which cheered theeighteenth-century thinkers in their struggle for intellectual libertycoloured with a delightful brightness this vision of a renewed humanity.</p> 
<p>　　It threw its beams on every branch of research, and shone like anaureole round those who laid down fortune and advancement to purchasethe new redemption of mankind. Foremost among these, as Odo now learned,were many of his own countrymen. In his talks with Vivaldi he firstexplored the course of Italian thought and heard the names of the greatjurists, Vico and Gravina, and of his own contemporaries, Filangieri,Verri and Beccaria. Vivaldi lent him Beccaria's famous volume andseveral numbers of the "Caffe," the brilliant gazette which Verri andhis associates were then publishing in Milan, and in which all thequestions of the day, theological, economic and literary, were discussedwith a freedom possible only under the lenient Austrian rule.</p> 
<p>　　"Ah," Vivaldi cried, "Milan is indeed the home of the free spirit, andwere I not persuaded that a man's first duty is to improve the conditionof his own city and state, I should long ago have left this unhappykingdom; indeed I sometimes fancy I may yet serve my own people betterby proclaiming the truth openly at a distance than by whispering it intheir midst."It was a surprise to Odo to learn that the new ideas had already takensuch hold in Italy, and that some of the foremost thinkers on scientificand economic subjects were among his own countrymen. Like alleighteenth-century Italians of his class he had been taught to look toFrance as the source of all culture, intellectual and social; and he wasamazed to find that in jurisprudence, and in some of the naturalsciences, Italy led the learning of Europe.</p> 
<p>　　Once or twice Fulvia showed herself for a moment; but her manner wasretiring and almost constrained, and her father always contrived anexcuse for dismissing her. This was the more noticeable as she continuedto appear at the meetings of the Honey-Bees, where she joined freely inthe conversation, and sometimes diverted the guests by playing on theharpsichord or by recitations from the poets; all with such art andgrace, and withal so much simplicity, that it was clear she wasaccustomed to the part. Odo was thus driven to the not unflatteringconclusion that she had been instructed to avoid his company; and afterthe first disappointment he was too honest to regret it. He was deeplydrawn to the girl; but what part could she play in the life of a man ofhis rank? The cadet of an impoverished house, it was unlikely that hewould marry; and should he do so, custom forbade even the thought oftaking a wife outside of his class. Had he been admitted to freeintercourse with Fulvia, love might have routed such prudent counsels;but in the society of her father's associates, where she moved, as in ahalo of learning, amid the respectful admiration of middle-agedphilosophers and jurists, she seemed as inaccessible as a young Minerva.</p> 
<p>　　Odo, at first, had been careful not to visit Vivaldi too often; but theProfessor's conversation was so instructive, and his library soinviting, that inclination got the better of prudence, and the young manfell into the habit of turning almost daily down the lane behind theCorpus Domini. Vivaldi, too proud to betray any concern for his personalsafety, showed no sign of resenting the frequency of these visits;indeed, he received Odo with an increasing cordiality that, to an olderobserver, might have betokened an effort to hide his apprehension.</p> 
<p>　　One afternoon, escaping later than usual from the Valentino, Odo hadagain bent toward the quiet quarter behind the palace. He was afoot,with a cloak over his laced coat, and the day being Easter Monday thestreets were filled with a throng of pleasure-seekers amid whom itseemed easy enough for a man to pass unnoticed. Odo, as he crossed thePiazza Castello, thought it had never presented a gayer scene. Boothswith brightly-striped awnings had been set up under the arcades, whichwere thronged with idlers of all classes; court-coaches dashed acrossthe square or rolled in and out of the palace-gates; and the PalazzoMadama, lifting against the sunset its ivory-tinted columns and statues,seemed rather some pictured fabric of Claude's or Bibbiena's than anactual building of brick and marble. The turn of a corner carried himfrom this spectacle into the solitude of a by-street where his own treadwas the only sound. He walked on carelessly; but suddenly he heard whatseemed an echo of his step. He stopped and faced about. No one was insight but a blind beggar crouching at the side-door of the CorpusDomini. Odo walked on, listening, and again he heard the step, and againturned to find himself alone. He tried to fancy that his ear had trickedhim; but he knew too much of the subtle methods of Italian espionage notto feel a secret uneasiness. His better judgment warned him back; butthe desire to spend a pleasant hour prevailed. He took a turn throughthe neighbouring streets, in the hope of diverting suspicion, and tenminutes later was at the Professor's gate.</p> 
<p>　　It opened at once, and to his amazement Fulvia stood before him. She hadthrown a black mantle over her head, and her face looked pale and vividin the fading light. Surprise for a moment silenced Odo, and before hecould speak the girl, without pausing to close the gate, had drawn himtoward her and flung her arms about his neck. In the first disorder ofhis senses he was conscious only of seeking her lips; but an instantlater he knew it was no kiss of love that met his own, and he felt hertremble violently in his arms. He saw in a flash that he was on unknownground; but his one thought was that Fulvia was in trouble and looked tohim for aid. He gently freed himself from her hold and tried to shape asoothing question; but she caught his arm and, laying a hand over hismouth, drew him across the garden and into the house. The lower floorstood dark and empty. He followed Fulvia up the stairs and into thelibrary, which was also empty. The shutters stood wide, admitting theevening freshness and a drowsy scent of jasmine from the garden.</p> 
<p>　　Odo could not control a thrill of strange anticipation as he foundhimself alone in this silent room with the girl whose heart had solately beat against his own. She had sunk into a chair, with her facehidden, and for a moment or two he stood before her without speaking.</p> 
<p>　　Then he knelt at her side and took her hands with a murmur ofendearment.</p> 
<p>　　At his touch she started up. "And it was I," she cried, "who persuadedmy father that he might trust you!" And she sank back sobbing.</p> 
<p>　　Odo rose and moved away, waiting for her overwrought emotion to subside.</p> 
<p>　　At length he gently asked, "Do you wish me to leave you?"She raised her head. "No," she said firmly, though her lip stilltrembled; "you must first hear an explanation of my conduct; though itis scarce possible," she added, flushing to the brow, "that you have notalready guessed the purpose of this lamentable comedy.""I guess nothing," he replied, "save that perhaps I may in some wayserve you.""Serve me?" she cried, with a flash of anger through her tears. "It is alate hour to speak of service, after what you have brought on thishouse!"Odo turned pale. "Here indeed, madam," said he, "are words that need anexplanation.""Oh," she broke forth, "and you shall have it; though I think to anyother it must be writ large upon my countenance." She rose and paced thefloor impetuously. "Is it possible," she began again, "you do not yetperceive the sense of that execrable scene? Or do you think, by feigningignorance, to prolong my humiliation? Oh," she said, pausing before him,her breast in a tumult, her eyes alight, "it was I who persuaded myfather of your discretion and prudence, it was through my influence thathe opened himself to you so freely; and is this the return you make?</p> 
<p>　　Alas, why did you leave your fashionable friends and a world in whichyou are so fitted to shine, to bring unhappiness on an obscure householdthat never dreamed of courting your notice?"As she stood before him in her radiant anger, it went hard with Odo notto silence with a kiss a resentment that he guessed to be mainlydirected against herself; but he controlled himself and said quietly:</p> 
<p>　　"Madam, I were a dolt not to perceive that I have had the misfortune tooffend; but when or how, I swear to heaven I know not; and till youenlighten me I can neither excuse nor defend myself."She turned pale, but instantly recovered her composure. "You are right,"she said; "I rave like a foolish girl; but indeed I scarce know if I amin my waking senses"--She paused, as if to check a fresh rush ofemotion. "Oh, sir," she cried, "can you not guess what has happened? Youwere warned, I believe, not to frequent this house too openly; but oflate you have been an almost daily visitor, and you never come here butyou are followed. My father's doctrines have long been under suspicion,and to be accused of perverting a man of your rank must be his ruin. Hewas too proud to tell you this, and profiting today by his absence, andknowing that if you came the spies would be at your heels, I resolved tomeet you at the gate, and welcome you in such a way that our enemiesshould be deceived as to the true cause of your visits."Her voice wavered on the last words, but she faced him proudly, and itwas Odo whose gaze fell. Never perhaps had he been conscious of cuttinga meaner figure; yet shame was so blent in him with admiration for thegirl's nobility and courage, that compunction was swept away in theimpulse that flung him at her feet.</p> 
<p>　　"Ah," he cried, "I have been blind indeed, and what you say abases me toearth. Yes, I was warned that my visits might compromise your father;nor had I any pretext for returning so often but my own selfish pleasurein his discourse; or so at least," he added in a lower voice, "I choseto fancy--but when we met just now at the gate, if you acted a comedy,believe me, I did not; and if I have come day after day to this house,it is because, unknowingly, I came for you."The words had escaped him unawares, and he was too sensible of theiruntimeliness not to be prepared for the gesture with which she cut himshort.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh," said she, in a tone of the liveliest reproach, "spare me this lastaffront if you wish me to think the harm you have already done was doneunknowingly!"Odo rose to his feet, tingling under the rebuke. "If respect andadmiration be an affront, madam," he said, "I cannot remain in yourpresence without offending, and nothing is left me but to withdraw; butbefore going I would at least ask if there is no way of repairing theharm that my over-assiduity has caused."She flushed high at the question. "Why, that," she said, "is in part, Itrust, already accomplished; indeed," she went on with an effort, "itwas when I learned the authorities suspected you of coming here on agallant adventure that I devised the idea of meeting you at the gate;and for the rest, sir, the best reparation you can make is one that willnaturally suggest itself to a gentleman whose time must already be sofully engaged."And with that she made him a deep reverence, and withdrew to the innerroom.</p>
