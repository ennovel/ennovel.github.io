The travelling-carriage must be purchased andfitted out, the gold-mounted dressing-case selected and engraved withthe owner's arms, servants engaged and provided with liveries, and thenoble tourist's own wardrobe stocked with an assortment of costumessuited to the vicissitudes of travel and the requirements of court life.</p> 
<p>　　Odo's impatience to be gone increased with every delay, and at length hedetermined to go forward at all adventure, leaving Cantapresto toconclude the preparations and overtake him later. It had been agreedwith Trescorre that Odo, on his way to Pianura, should visit hisgrandfather, the old Marquess, whose increasing infirmities had for someyears past imprisoned him on his estates, and accordingly about theAscension he set out in the saddle for Donnaz, attended only by oneservant, and having appointed that Cantapresto should meet him with thecarriage at Ivrea.</p> 
<p>　　The morning broke cloudy as he rode out of the gates. Beyond the suburbsa few drops fell, and as he pressed forward the country lay before himin the emerald freshness of a spring rain, vivid strips of vineyardalternating with silvery bands of oats, the domes of the walnut-treesdripping above the roadside, and the poplars along the water-courses allslanting one way in the soft continuous downpour. He had left Turin inthat mood of clinging melancholy which waits on the most hopefuldepartures, and the landscape seemed an image of anticipations cloudedwith regret. He had had a stormy but tender parting with Clarice, whoseefforts to act the forsaken Ariadne were somewhat marred by herirrepressible pride in her lover's prospects, and whose last word hadcharged him to bring her back one of the rare lap-dogs bred by the monksof Bologna. Seen down the lengthening vista of separation even Clariceseemed regrettable; and Odo would have been glad to let his mind lingeron their farewells. But another thought importuned him. He had leftTurin without news of Vivaldi or Fulvia, and without having doneanything to conjure the peril to which his rashness had exposed them.</p> 
<p>　　More than once he had been about to reveal his trouble to Alfieri; butshame restrained him when he remembered that it was Alfieri who hadvouched for his discretion. After his conversation with Trescorre he hadtried to find some way of sending a word of warning to Vivaldi; but hehad no messenger whom he could trust; and would not Vivaldi justlyresent a warning from such a source? He felt himself the prisoner of hisown folly, and as he rode along the wet country roads an invisiblegaoler seemed to spur beside him.</p> 
<p>　　The clouds lifted at noon; and leaving the plain he mounted into a worldsparkling with sunshine and quivering with new-fed streams. The firstbreath of mountain-air lifted the mist from his spirit, and he began tofeel himself a boy again as he entered the high gorges in the cold lightafter sunset. It was about the full of the moon, and in his impatienceto reach Donnaz he resolved to push on after nightfall. The forest wasstill thinly-leaved, and the rustle of wind in the branches and thenoise of the torrents recalled his first approach to the castle, in thewild winter twilight. The way lay in darkness till the moon rose, andonce or twice he took a wrong turn and found himself engaged in someovergrown woodland track; but he soon regained the high-road, and hisservant, a young fellow of indomitable cheerfulness, took the edge offtheir solitude by frequent snatches of song. At length the moon rose,and toward midnight Odo, spurring out of a dark glen, found himself atthe opening of the valley of Donnaz. A cold radiance bathed the familiarpastures, the houses of the village along the stream, and the turretsand crenellations of the castle at the head of the gorge. The air wasbitter, and the horses' hoofs struck sharply on the road as they trottedpast the slumbering houses and halted at the gateway through which Odohad first been carried as a sleepy child. It was long before thetravellers' knock was answered, but a bewildered porter at lengthadmitted them, and Odo cried out when he recognised in the man's facethe features of one of the lads who had taught him to play pallone inthe castle court.</p> 
<p>　　Within doors all were abed; but the cavaliere was expected, and supperlaid for him in the very chamber where he had slept as a lad. The sightof so much that was strange and yet familiar--of the old stone walls,the banners, the flaring lamps and worn slippery stairs--all so muchbarer, smaller, more dilapidated than he had remembered--stirred thedeep springs of his piety for inanimate things, and he was seized with afancy to snatch up a light and explore the recesses of the castle. Buthe had been in the saddle since dawn, and the keen air and the longhours of riding were in his blood. They weighted his lids, relaxed hislimbs, and gently divesting him of his hopes and fears, pressed him downin the deep sepulchre of a dreamless sleep...</p> 
<p>　　Odo remained a month at Donnaz. His grandfather's happiness in hispresence would in itself have sufficed to detain him, apart from hisnatural tenderness for old scenes and associations. It was one of thecompensations of his rapidly travelling imagination that the past, fromeach new vantage-ground of sensation, acquired a fascination which tothe more sober-footed fancy only the perspective of years can give.</p> 
<p>　　Life, in childhood, is a picture-book of which the text isundecipherable; and the youth now revisiting the unchanged setting ofhis boyhood was spelling out for the first time the legend beneath thepicture.</p> 
<p>　　The old Marquess, though broken in body, still ruled his household fromhis seat beside the hearth. The failure of bodily activity seemed tohave doubled his moral vigour, and the walls shook with the vehemence ofhis commands. The Marchioness was sunk in a state of placid apathy fromwhich only her husband's outbursts roused her; one of the canonesses wasdead, and the other, drier and more shrivelled than ever, pined in hercorner like a statue whose mate is broken. Bruno was dead too; his olddog's bones had long since enriched a corner of the vineyard; and someof the younger lads that Odo had known about the place were grown tosober-faced men with wives and children.</p> 
<p>　　Don Gervaso was still chaplain of Donnaz; and Odo saw with surprise thatthe grave ecclesiastic who had formerly seemed an old man to him was infact scarce past the middle age. In general aspect he was unchanged; buthis countenance had darkened, and what Odo had once taken for harshnessof manner he now perceived to be a natural melancholy. The young man hadnot been long at Donnaz without discovering that in that little world ofcrystallised traditions the chaplain was the only person conscious ofthe new forces abroad. It had never occurred to the Marquess thatanything short of a cataclysm such as it would be blasphemy to predictcould change the divinely established order whereby the territorial lordtook tithes from his peasantry and pastured his game on their crops. Thehierarchy which rested on the bowed back of the toiling serf andculminated in the figure of the heaven-sent King seemed to him asimmutable as the everlasting hills. The men of his generation had notlearned that it was built on a human foundation and that a suddenmovement of the underlying mass might shake the structure to itspinnacle. The Marquess, who, like Donna Laura, already beheld Odo on thethrone of Pianura, was prodigal of counsels which showed a touchinginability to discern the new aspect under which old difficulties werelikely to present themselves. That a ruler should be brave, prudent,personally abstemious, and nobly lavish in his official display; that heshould repress any attempts on the privileges of the Church, while atthe same time protecting his authority from the encroachments of theHoly See; these axioms seemed to the old man to sum up the sovereign'sduty to the state. The relation, to his mind, remained a distinctlypersonal and paternal one; and Odo's attempts to put before him the newtheory of government, as a service performed by the ruler in theinterest of the ruled, resulted only in stirring up the old sediment ofabsolutism which generations of feudal power had deposited in the Donnazblood.</p> 
<p>　　Only the chaplain perceived what new agencies were at work; but even helooked on as a watcher from a distant tower, who sees opposing armiesfar below him in the night, without being able to follow their movementsor guess which way the battle goes.</p> 
<p>　　"The days," he said to Odo, "are evil. The Church's enemies, thebasilisks and dragons of unbelief and license, are stirring in their oldlairs, the dark places of the human spirit. It is time that a freshpurification by blood should cleanse the earth of its sins. That hourhas already come in France, where the blood of heretics has latelyfertilised the soil of faith; it will come here, as surely as I nowstand before you; and till it comes the faithful can only weary heavenwith their entreaties, if haply thereby they may mitigate the evil. Ishall remain here," he continued, "while the Marquess needs me; but thattask discharged, I intend to retire to one of the contemplative orders,and with my soul perpetually uplifted like the arms of Moses, wear outmy life in prayer for those whom the latter days shall overtake."Odo had listened in silence; but after a moment he said: "My father,among those who have called in to question the old order of things thereare many animated by no mere desire for change, no idle inclination topry into the divine mysteries, but who earnestly long to ease the burdenof mankind and let light into what you have called the dark places ofthe spirit. How is it, they ask, that though Christ came to save thepoor and the humble, it is on them that life presses most heavily aftereighteen hundred years of His rule? All cannot be well in a world wheresuch contradictions exist, and what if some of the worst abuses of theage have found lodgment in the very ramparts that faith has builtagainst them?"Don Gervaso's face grew stern and his eyes rested sadly on Odo. "Youspeak," said he, "of bringing light into dark places; but what light isthere on earth save that which is shed by the Cross, and where shallthey find guidance who close their eyes to that divine illumination?""But is there not," Odo rejoined, "a divine illumination within each ofus, the light of truth which we must follow at any cost--or have theworst evils and abuses only to take refuge in the Church to findsanctuary there, as malefactors find it?"The chaplain shook his head. "It is as I feared," he said, "and Satanhas spread his subtlest snare for you; for if he tempts some in theguise of sensual pleasure, or of dark fears and spiritual abandonment,it is said that to those he most thirsts to destroy he appears in thelikeness of their Saviour. You tell me it is to right the wrongs of thepoor and the humble that your new friends, the philosophers, haveassailed the authority of Christ. I have only one answer to make:</p> 
<p>　　Christ, as you said just now, died for the poor--how many of yourphilosophers would do as much? Because men hunger and thirst, is that asign that He has forsaken them? And since when have earthly privilegesbeen the token of His favour? May He not rather have designed that, bycontinual sufferings and privations, they shall lay up for themselvestreasures in Heaven such as your eyes and mine shall never see or ourears hear? And how dare you assume that any temporal advantages couldatone for that of which your teachings must deprive them--the heavenlyconsolations of the love of Christ?"Odo listened with a sense of deepening discouragement. "But is itnecessary," he urged, "to confound Christ with His ministers, the lawwith its exponents? May not men preserve their hope of heaven and yetlead more endurable lives on earth?""Ah, my child, beware, for this is the heresy of private judgment, whichhas already drawn down thousands into the pit. It is one of the mostinsidious errors in which the spirit of evil has ever masqueraded; forit is based on the fallacy that we, blind creatures of a day, andourselves in the meshes of sin, can penetrate the counsels of theEternal, and test the balances of the heavenly Justice. I tremble tothink into what an abyss your noblest impulses may fling you, if youabandon yourself to such illusions; and more especially if it pleasesGod to place in your hands a small measure of that authority of which Heis the supreme repository.--When I took leave of you here nine yearssince," Don Gervaso continued in a gentler tone, "we prayed together inthe chapel; and I ask you, before setting out on your new life, toreturn there with me and lay your doubts and difficulties before Him whoalone is able to still the stormy waves of the soul."Odo, touched by the appeal, accompanied him to the chapel, and knelt onthe steps whence his young spirit had once soared upward on the heavenlypleadings of the Mass. The chapel was as carefully tended as ever; andamid the comely appointments of the altar shone forth that Presencewhich speaks to men of an act of love perpetually renewed. But to Odothe voice was mute, the divinity wrapped in darkness; and he rememberedreading in some Latin author that the ancient oracles had ceased tospeak when their questioners lost faith in them. He knew not whether hisown faith was lost; he felt only that it had put forth on a sea ofdifficulties across which he saw the light of no divine command.</p> 
<p>　　In this mood there was no more help to be obtained from Don Gervaso thanfrom the Marquess. Odo's last days at Donnaz were clouded by a sense ofthe deep estrangement between himself and that life of which the outwardaspect was so curiously unchanged. His past seemed to look at him withunrecognising eyes, to bar the door against his knock; and he rode awaysaddened by that sense of isolation which follows the first encounterwith a forgotten self.</p> 
<p>　　At Ivrea the sight of Cantapresto and the travelling-carriage roused himas from a waking dream. Here, at his beck were the genial realities oflife, embodied, humorously enough, in the bustling figure which for somany years had played a kind of comic accompaniment to his experiences.</p> 
<p>　　Cantapresto was in a fever of expectation. To set forth on the roadagain, after nine years of well-fed monotony, and under conditions sofavourable to his physical well-being, was to drink the wine of romancefrom a golden cup. Odo was at the age when the spirit lies as naturallyopen to the variations of mood as a lake to the shifting of the breeze;and Cantapresto's exuberant humour, and the novel details of theirtravelling equipment, had soon effaced the graver influences of Donnaz.</p> 
<p>　　Life stretched before him alluring and various as the open road; and hispulses danced to the tune of the postillion's whip as the carriagerattled out of the gates.</p> 
<p>　　It was a bright morning and the plain lay beneath them like a plantedgarden, in all the flourish and verdure of June; but the roads beingdeep in mire, and unrepaired after the ravages of the winter, it waspast noon before they reached the foot of the hills. Here matters werelittle better, for the highway was ploughed deep by the wheels of thenumberless vans and coaches journeying from one town to another duringthe Whitsun holidays, so that even a young gentleman travelling postmust resign himself to a plebeian rate of progression. Odo at first wastoo much pleased with the novelty of the scene to quarrel with anyincidental annoyances; but as the afternoon wore on the way began toseem long, and he was just giving utterance to his impatience whenCantapresto, putting his head out of the window, announced in a tone ofpious satisfaction that just ahead of them were a party of travellers infar worse case than themselves. Odo, leaning out, saw that, a dozenyards ahead, a modest chaise of antique pattern had in fact come togrief by the roadside. He called to his postillion to hurry forward, andthey were soon abreast of the wreck, about which several people weregrouped in anxious colloquy. Odo sprang out to offer his services; butas he alit he felt Cantapresto's hand on his sleeve.</p> 
<p>　　"Cavaliere," the soprano whispered, "these are plainly people of nocondition, and we have yet a good seven miles to Vercelli, where all theinns will be crowded for the Whitsun fair. Believe me, it were better togo forward."Odo advanced without heeding this admonition; but a moment later he hadalmost regretted his action; for in the centre of the group about thechaise stood the two persons whom, of all the world, he was at thatmoment least wishful of meeting.</p>
