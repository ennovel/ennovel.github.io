<p>And the more substantial, the more solid the core of me became, the more delicate and extravagant appeared the close, palpable reality out of which I was being squeezed. In the measure that I became more and more metallic, in the same measure the scene before my eyes became inflated. The state of tension was so finely drawn now that the introduction of a single foreign particle, even a microscopic particle, as I say, would have shattered everything. For the fraction of a second perhaps I experienced that utter clarity which the epileptic, it is said, is given to know. In that moment I lost completely the illusion of time and space: the world unfurled its drama simultaneously along a meridian which had no axis. In this sort of hair trigger eternity I felt that everything was justified, supremely justified; I felt the wars inside me that had left behind this pulp and wrack; I felt the crimes that were seething here to emerge tomorrow in blatant screamers; I felt the misery that was grinding itself out with pestle and mortar, the long dull misery that dribbles away in dirty handkerchiefs. On the meridian of time there is no injustice: there is only the poetry of motion creating the illusion of truth and drama. If at any moment anywhere one comes face to face with the absolute, that great sympathy which makes men like Gautama and Jesus seem divine freezes away; the monstrous thing is not that men have created roses out of this dung heap, but that, for some reason or other, they should want roses. For some reason or other man looks for the miracle, and to accomplish it he will wade through blood. He will debauch himself with ideas, he will reduce himself to a shadow if for only one second of his life he can close his eyes to the hideousness of reality. Everything is endured – disgrace, humiliation, poverty, war, crime, ennui – in the belief that overnight something will occur, a miracle, which will render life tolerable. And all the while a meter is running inside and there is no hand that can reach in there and shut it off. All the while someone is eating the bread of life and drinking the wine, some dirty fat cockroach of a priest who hides away in the cellar guzzling it, while up above in the light of the street a phantom host touches the lips and the blood is pale as water. And out of the endless torment and misery no miracle comes forth, no microscopic vestige of relief. Only ideas, pale, attenuated ideas which have to be fattened by slaughter; ideas which come forth like bile, like the guts of a pig when the carcass is ripped open.</p>

<p>　　于是我想到，假如这个人类永远朝思暮想的奇迹原来什么也不是，只是甘地的这位忠实弟子在坐浴盆里拉的两截粗粗的大便，那将是怎样的一个奇迹埃假如在宴会桌已摆好，吃饭的铃声已响起了最后一刹那，在事先并没有告知大家的情况下一只大银盘突然端上来，连瞎于也可以看到上面不偏不倚、不歪不斜地摆着两截粗粗的大便—我认为这才是最叫人惊叹不已的奇迹，比人们盼望的任何奇迹更刺激。大家都不会预料到，所以说这是叫人惊叹不已的。它又是比最最荒诞的奇思异想更叫人惊叹不己的，因为虽然人人都可能猜到这种可能性，却没有一个人猜中，而且今后也不见得会有人猜中。</p> 
<p>And so I think what a miracle it would be if this miracle which man attends eternally should turn out to be nothing more than these two enormous turds which the faithful disciple dropped in the bidet. What if at the last moment, when the banquet table is set and the cymbals clash, there should appear suddenly, and wholly without warning, a silver platter on which even the blind could see that there is nothing more, and nothing less, than two enormous lumps of shit. That, I believe would be more miraculous than anything which man has looked forward to. It would be miraculous because it would be undreamed of. It would be more miraculous than even the wildest dream because anybody could imagine the possibility but nobody ever has, and probably nobody ever again will.</p>

<p>　　不知怎么搞的，意识到没有一件事情是有指望的倒对我产生了有益的影响。多少个星期、多少个月、多少年来，实际上是一辈子，我一直在盼望发生什么事情—会改变我的生活的外来事件。现在，猛然受到样样皆没有指望的事情的启发，我觉得如释重负，觉得肩上一个沉重负担已卸下。黎明时我同这个年轻的印度人分手，事先向他讨了够租一间房的几个法郎。朝蒙帕纳斯走去时我打定主意让自己随波逐流，对命运不做一点儿抵抗，不管它是凶是吉。迄今为止，在我身上发生的一切尚不足以毁灭我，除了我的梦幻，它现在也还不曾毁掉什么。我未受损害，这个世界也未受损害。明天也许会爆发一场革命，出现一场瘟疫，发生一场地震，明天也许不会剩下一个可以向他寻求同情，帮助和信任的人。我认为这场大灾难已经显露出迹象，我再也不会像此时此刻这样真的一人独处。我打定主意什么也不再坚持，什么也不再指望，从今以后我要像牲口一样生活，像一只猛兽，一个流浪汉、一个强盗。即使宣战，我又命中注定要上前线，我也会抓起刺刀去戮，一直戮到刀柄。如果那天的命令是强奸女人，那么我就会不遗余力地去强奸。就在此刻，就在新的一天到来的这宁静黎明之际，这个世界不是充满着罪恶和悲伤吗，可曾有哪一人类天性中的成分被历史无休止的进程所改变，根本地、重大地改变？实情是，人类被他称之为自己天性中较好的那一部分叛卖了，在精神的极限上，人类再次发现自己像野人一样赤裸着身子。可以说，当人类找到上帝时他们自己被剔光了肉，成为一个骨架。为了重新长上肉，他必须再活一遭。”上帝”这个词一定得变成肉，这是灵魂的渴求。不论我的眼睛看到了多么碎的面包屑，我都要猛扑上去把它吞下去。若是活着便是至高无上的，我就活着，哪怕为此一定要成为一个吃人生番也罢。直到现在我一直在设法保住我这宝贵的臭皮囊，保住包着骨头的那几块肉。这种生活该完结了，我已忍到极限，我的背已贴到墙上，无法再后退。就历史的演变来说我已死去，倘若还有什么希望我只好再赶回来。我找到了上帝，但上帝也无济于事。我只是在精神上死了，肉体上仍活着，而在道德上我又是自由的。我已告别世界是一个动物园，黎明正在一个新世界里降临，一个弱肉强食的世界，精瘦的灵魂挥舞锋利的爪子在其中漫游。如果我是一头鬣狗，我准是一只瘦弱，饥饿的鬣狗，我这就出发去喂肥自己。</p> 
<p>Somehow the realization that nothing was to be hoped for had a salutary effect upon me. For weeks and months, for years, in fact, all my life I had been looking forward to something happening, some intrinsic event that would alter my life, and now suddenly, inspired by the absolute hopelessness of everything, I felt relieved, felt as though a great burden had been lifted from my shoulders. At dawn I parted company with the young Hindu, after touching him for a few francs, enough for a room. Walking toward Montparnasse I decided to let myself drift with the tide, to make not the least resistance to fate, no matter in what form it presented itself. Nothing that had happened to me thus far had been sufficient to destroy me; nothing had been destroyed except my illusions. I myself was intact. The world was intact. Tomorrow there might be a revolution, a plague, an earthquake; tomorrow there might not be left a single soul to whom one could turn for sympathy, for aid, for faith. It seemed to me that the great calamity had already manifested itself, that I could be no more truly alone than at this very moment. I made up my mind that I would hold on to nothing, that I would expect nothing, that henceforth I would live as an animal, a beast of prey, a rover, a plunderer. Even if war were declared, and it were my lot to go, I would grab the bayonet and plunge it, plunge it up to the hilt. And if rape were the order of the day then rape I would, and with a vengeance. At this very moment, in the quiet dawn of a new day, was not the earth giddy with crime and distress? Had one single element of man's nature been altered, vitally, fundamentally altered, by the incessant march of history? By what he calls the better part of his nature, man has been betrayed, that is all. At the extreme limits of his spiritual being man finds himself again naked as a savage. When he finds God, as it were, he has been picked clean: he is a skeleton. One must burrow into life again in order to put on flesh. The word must become flesh; the soul thirsts. On whatever crumb my eye fastens, I will pounce and devour. If to live is the paramount thing, then I will live, even if I must become a cannibal. Heretofore I have been trying to save my precious hide, trying to preserve the few pieces of meat that hid my bones. I am done with that. I have reached the limits of endurance. My back is to the wall; I can retreat no further. As far as history goes I am dead. If there is something beyond I shall have to bounce back. I have found God, but he is insufficient. I am only spiritually dead. Physically I am alive. Morally I am free. The world which I have departed is a menagerie. The dawn is breaking on a new world, a jungle world in which the lean spirits roam with sharp claws. If I am a hyena I am a lean and hungry one: I go forth to fatten myself.</p>
