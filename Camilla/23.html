<p>He galloped, therefore, to the parsonage-house of Cleves, and entering the study of the Doctor, and taking him by the hand, with the most animated gesture; ‘My dear and honoured friend,’ he cried, ‘I come to you now without hesitation, and free from every painful embarrassment of lurking irresolution! I come to you decided, and upon grounds which cannot offend you, though the decision anticipates your counsel. I come to you, in fine, my dear Doctor, my good and kind friend, to confess that yesterday you saw right, with regard to the situation of my mind, and that, today, I have only your felicitations to beg, upon my confirmed, my irrevocable choice!’</p> 
<p>Dr. Marchmont embraced him: ‘May you then,’ he cried, ‘be as happy, my dear young friend, as you deserve! I can wish you nothing higher.’</p> 
<p>‘Last night,’ continued Edgar, ‘I felt all doubt die away: captivating as I have ever thought her, so soft, so gentle, so touchingly sweet, as last night, I had never yet beheld her; you witnessed it, my dear Doctor? you saw her with the baby in her arms? how beautiful, how endearing a sight!’</p> 
<p>The Doctor looked assentingly, but did not speak.</p> 
<p>‘Yet even last night was short of the feelings she excited this morning. My dear friend! she was upon the point of making an excursion from which she had promised herself peculiar pleasure, and to see a lady for whom she had conceived the warmest admiration–I begged her to postpone-perhaps relinquish entirely the visit-she had obtained leave from Sir Hugh-the carriage was at the door-would you, could you believe such sweetness with such vivacity? she complied with my request, and complied with a grace that has rivetted her–I own it-that has rivetted her to my soul!’</p> 
<p>Doctor Marchmont smiled, but rather pensively than rejoicingly; and Edgar, receiving no answer, walked for some time about the room, silently enjoying his own thoughts.</p> 
<p>Returning then to the Doctor, ‘My dear friend,’ he cried, ‘I understood you wished to speak with me?’</p> 
<p>‘Yes-but I thought you disengaged.’</p> 
<p>‘So, except mentally, I am still.’</p> 
<p>‘Does she not yet know her conquest?’</p> 
<p>‘She does not even guess it.’</p> 
<p>Dr. Marchmont now rising, with much energy said: ‘Hear me then, my dear and most valued young friend, forbear to declare yourself, make no overtures to her relations, raise no expectations even in her own breast, and let not rumour surmise your passion to the world, till her heart is better known to you.’</p> 
<p>Edgar, starting and amazed, with great emotion exclaimed: ‘What do you mean, my good Doctor? do you suspect any prior engagement? any fatal prepossession?’–</p> 
<p>‘I suspect nothing. I do not know her. I mean not, therefore, the propensities alone, but the worth, also, of her heart; deception is easy, and I must not see you thrown away.’</p> 
<p>‘Let me, then, be her guarantee!’ cried Edgar, with firmness; ‘for I know her well! I have known her from her childhood, and cannot be deceived. I fear nothing-except my own powers of engaging her regard. I can trace to a certainty, even from my boyish remarks, her fair, open, artless, and disinterested charachter.’</p> 
<p>He then gave a recital of the nobleness of her sentiments and conduct when only nine years old; contrasting the relation with the sullen and ungenerous behaviour of Indiana at the same age.</p> 
<p>Dr. Marchmont listened to the account with attention and pleasure, but not with an air of that full conviction which Edgar expected. ‘All this,’ he said, ‘is highly prophetic of good, and confirms me in the opinion I expressed last night, that every possible happiness promises to be yours.’</p> 
<p>‘Yet, still,’ said Edgar, a little chagrined, ‘there seems some drawback to your entire approbation?’</p> 
<p>‘To your choice I have none.’</p> 
<p>‘You perplex me, Doctor! I know not to what you object, what you would intimate, nor what propose?’</p> 
<p>‘All I have to suggest may be comprised in two points: First, That you will refuse confirmation even to your own intentions, till you have positively ascertained her actual possession of those virtues with which she appears to be endowed: and secondly, That if you find her gifted with them all, you will not solicit her acceptance till you are satisfied of her affection.’</p> 
<p>‘My dear Doctor,’ cried Edgar, half laughing, ‘from what an alarm of wild conjecture has your explanation relieved me! Hear me, however, in return, and I think I can satisfy you, that, even upon your own conditions, not an obstacle stands in the way of my speaking to Mr. Tyrold this very evening.</p> 
<p>‘With regard to your first article, her virtues, I have told you the dawning superiority of her most juvenile ideas of right; and though I have latterly lost sight of her, by travelling during our vacations, I know her to have always been under the superintendence of one of the first of women; and for these last three weeks, which I have spent under the same roof with her, I have observed her to be all that is amiable, sweet, natural, and generous. What then on this point remains? Nothing. I am irrefragably convinced of her worth.</p> 
<p>‘With respect to your second condition, I own you a little embarrass me; yet how may I inquire into the state of her affections, without acknowledging her mistress of mine?’</p> 
<p>‘Hold! hold!’ interrupted the Doctor, ‘you proceed too rapidly. The first article is all unsettled, while you are flying to the last.</p> 
<p>‘It is true, and I again repeat it, every promise is in your favour; but do not mistake promise for performance. This young lady appears to be all excellence; for an acquaintance, for a friend, I doubt not you have already seen enough to establish her in your good opinion-but since it is only within a few hours you have taken the resolution which is to empower her to colour the rest of your life, you must study her, from this moment, with new eyes, new ears, and new thoughts. Whatever she does, you must ask yourself this question: “Should I like such behaviour in my wife?” Whatever she says, you must make yourself the same demand. Nothing must escape you; you must view as if you had never seen her before; the interrogatory, Were she mine? must be present at every look, every word, every motion; you must forget her wholly as Camilla Tyrold, you must think of her only as Camilla Mandlebert; even justice is insufficient during this period of probation, and instead of inquiring, “Is this right in her?” you must simply ask, “Would it be pleasing to me?"’</p> 
<p>‘You are apprehensive, then, of some dissimilitude of character prejudicial to our future happiness?’</p> 
<p>‘Not of character; you have been very peculiarly situated for obviating all risk upon that first and most important particular. I have no doubt of her general worthiness; but though esteem hangs wholly upon character, happiness always links itself with disposition.’</p> 
<p>‘You gratify me, Doctor, by naming disposition, for I can give you the most unequivocal assurance of her sweetness, her innocence, her benevolence, joined to a spirit of never-dying vivacity-an animation of never-ceasing good humour!’</p> 
<p>‘I know you, my dear Mandlebert, to be, by nature, penetrating and minute in your observations; which, in your general commerce with the world, will protect both your understanding and your affections from the usual snares of youth: But here-to be even scrupulous is not enough; to avoid all danger of repentance, you must become positively distrustful.’</p> 
<p>‘Never, Doctor, never! I would sooner renounce every prospect of felicity, than act a part so ungenerous, where I am conscious of such desert! Upon this article, therefore, we have done; I am already and fully convinced of her excellence. But, with respect to your second difficulty, that I will not seek her acceptance, till satisfied of her regard-there-indeed, you start an idea that comes home to my soul in its very inmost recesses! O Doctor!-could I hope-however distantly-durst I hope-the independent, unsolicited, involuntary possession of that most ingenuous, most inartificial of human hearts!–’</p> 
<p>‘And why not? why, while so liberally you do justice to another, should you not learn to appreciate yourself?’</p> 
<p>A look of elation, delight, and happiness conveyed to Dr. Marchmont his pupil’s grateful sense of this question.</p> 
<p>‘I do not fear making you vain,’ he continued; ‘I know your understanding to be too solid, and your temperament too philosophic, to endanger your running into the common futility of priding yourself upon the gifts of nature, any more than upon those of fortune; ’tis in their uses only you can claim any applause. I will not, therefore, scruple to assert, you can hardly any where propose yourself with much danger of being rejected. You are amiable and accomplished; abounding in wealth, high in character; in person and appearance unexceptionable; you can have no doubt of the joyful approbation of her friends, nor can you entertain a reasonable fear of her concurrence; yet, with all this, pardon me, when I plainly, explicitly add, it is very possible you may be utterly indifferent to her.’</p> 
<p>‘If so, at least,’ said Edgar, in a tone and with a countenance whence all elation was flown, ‘she will leave me master of myself; she is too noble to suffer any sordid motives to unite us.’</p> 
<p>‘Do not depend upon that; the influence of friends, the prevalence of example, the early notion which every female imbibes, that a good establishment must be her first object in life-these are motives of marriage commonly sufficient for the whole sex.’</p> 
<p>‘Her choice, indeed,’ said Edgar, thoughtfully, ‘would not, perhaps, be wholly uninfluenced;–I pretend not to doubt that the voice of her friends would be all in my favour.’</p> 
<p>‘Yes,’ interrupted Dr. Marchmont, ‘and, be she noble as she may, Beech Park will be also in your favour! your mansion, your equipage, your domestics, even your table, will be in your favour–’</p> 
<p>‘Doctor,’ interrupted Edgar, in his turn, ‘I know you think ill of women.–’</p> 
<p>‘Do not let that idea weaken what I urge; I have not had reason to think well of them; yet I believe there are individuals who merit every regard: your Camilla may be one of them. Take, however, this warning from my experience; whatever is her appearance of worth, try and prove its foundation, ere you conclude it invulnerable; and whatever are your pretensions to her hand, do not necessarily connect them with your chances for her heart.’</p> 
<p>Mandlebert, filled now with a distrust of himself and of his powers, which he was incapable of harbouring of Camilla and her magnanimity, felt struck to the soul with the apprehension of failing to gain her affection, and wounded in every point both of honour and delicacy, from the bare suggestion of owing his wife to his situation in the world. He found no longer any difficulty in promising not to act with precipitance; his confidence was gone; his elevation of sentiment was depressed; a general mist clouded his prospects, and a suspensive discomfort inquieted his mind. He shook Dr. Marchmont by the hand, and assuring him he would weigh well all he had said, and take no measure till he had again consulted with him, remounted his horse, and slowly walked it back to Cleves.</p>
