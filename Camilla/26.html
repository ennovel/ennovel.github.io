Edgar instantly discerned the continued unhappiness, which an assumed smile concealed from the unsuspicious Sir Hugh, and the week of delay before him seemed an outrage to all his wishes.</p> 
<p>While she was drinking her first cup of tea, a servant came in, and told her the carriage was ready.</p> 
<p>She coloured, but nobody spoke, and the servant retired. Edgar was going to ask the design for the morning, when Miss Margland said–‘Miss Camilla, as the horses have got to go and return, you had better not keep them waiting.’</p> 
<p>Colouring still more deeply, she was going to disclaim having ordered them, though well aware for what purpose they were come, when Sir Hugh said–‘I think, my dear, you had best take Eugenia with you, which may serve you as a companion to talk to, in case you want to say anything by the way, which I take for granted; young people not much liking to hold their tongues for a long while together, which is very natural, having so little to think of.’</p> 
<p>‘Miss Eugenia, then,’ cried Miss Margland, before Camilla could reply, ‘run for your cloak as soon as you have finished your breakfast.’</p> 
<p>Eugenia, hoping to aid her sister in performing a task, which she considered as a peace-offering to Indiana, said, she had already done.</p> 
<p>Camilla now lost all courage for resistance; but feeling her chagrin almost intolerable, quitted the room with her tea undrunk, and without making known if she should return or not.</p> 
<p>Eugenia followed, and Edgar, much amazed, said, he had forgotten to order his horse for his morning’s ride, and hastily made off: determined to be ready to hand the sisters to the carriage, and learn whither it was to drive.</p> 
<p>Camilla, who, in flying to her room, thought of nothing less than preparing for an excursion which she now detested, was again surprised in tears by Eugenia.</p> 
<p>‘What, my dearest Camilla,’ she cried, ‘can thus continually affect you? you cannot be so unhappy without some cause!-why will you not trust your Eugenia?’</p> 
<p>‘I cannot talk,’ she answered, ashamed to repeat reasons which she knew Eugenia held to be inadequate to her concern–‘If there is no resource against this persecution-if I must render myself hateful to give them satisfaction, let us, at least, be gone immediately, and let me be spared seeing the person I so ungratefully offend.’</p> 
<p>She then hurried down stairs; but finding Edgar in waiting, still more quickly hurried back, and in an agony, for which she attempted not to account, cast herself into a chair, and told Eugenia, that if Miss Margland did not contrive to call Edgar away, the universe could not prevail with her to pass him in such defiance.</p> 
<p>‘My dear Camilla,’ said Eugenia, surprized, yet compassionately, ‘if this visit is become so painful to you, relinquish it at once.’</p> 
<p>‘Ah, no! for that cruel Miss Margland will then accuse me of staying away only to follow the counsel of Edgar.’</p> 
<p>She stopt; for the countenance of Eugenia said–‘And is that not your motive?’ A sudden consciousness took place of her distress; she hid her face, in the hope of concealing her emotion, and with as calm a voice as she could attain, said, the moment they could pass unobserved she would set off.</p> 
<p>Eugenia went downstairs.</p> 
<p>‘Alas! alas!’ she then cried, ‘into what misery has this barbarous Miss Margland thrown me! Eugenia herself seems now to suspect something wrong; and so, I suppose, will my uncle; and I can only convince them of my innocence by acting towards Edgar as a monster.–Ah! I would sooner a thousand times let them all think me guilty!’</p> 
<p>Eugenia had met Miss Margland in the hall, who, impatient for their departure, passed her, and ascended the stairs.</p> 
<p>At the sound of her footsteps, the horror of her reproaches and insinuations conquered every other feeling, and Camilla, starting up, rushed forward, and saying ‘Good morning!’ ran off.</p> 
<p>Edgar was still at the door, and came forward to offer her his hand. ‘Pray take care of Eugenia,’ she cried, abruptly passing him, and darting, unaided, into the chaise. Edgar, astonished, obeyed, and gave his more welcome assistance to Eugenia; but when both were seated, said–‘Where shall I tell the postillion to drive?’</p> 
<p>Camilla, who was pulling one of the green blinds up, and again letting it down, twenty times in a minute, affected not to hear him, but Eugenia answered, ‘to the Grove, to Mrs. Arlbery’s .’</p> 
<p>The postillion had already received his orders from Miss Margland, and drove off; leaving Edgar mute with surprise, disappointment and mortification.</p> 
<p>Miss Margland was just behind him, and conceived this the fortunate instant for eradicating from his mind every favourable pre-possession for Camilla; assuming, therefore, an air of concern, she said–‘So, you have found Miss Camilla out, in spite of all her precautions! she would fain not have had you know her frolic.’</p> 
<p>‘Not know it! has there, then, been any plan? did Miss Camilla intend–’</p> 
<p>‘O, she intends nothing in the world for two minutes together! only she did not like you should find out her fickleness. You know, I told you, before, she was all whim; and so you will find. You may always take my opinion, be assured. Miss Lynmere is the only one among them that is always the same, always good, always amiable.’</p> 
<p>‘And is not Miss–’ he was going to say Camilla, but checking himself, finished with–‘Miss Eugenia, at least, always equal, always consistent?’</p> 
<p>‘Why, she is better than Miss Camilla; but not one among them has any steadiness, or real sweetness, but Miss Lynmere. As to Miss Camilla, if she has not her own way, there’s no enduring her, she frets, and is so cross. When you put her off, in that friendly manner, from gadding after a new acquaintance so improper for her, you set her into such an ill humour, that she has done nothing but cry, as you may have seen by her eyes, and worry herself and all of us round, except you, ever since; but she was afraid of you, for fear you should take her to task, which she hates of all things.’</p> 
<p>Half incredulous, yet half shocked, Edgar turned from this harangue in silent disgust. He knew the splenetic nature of Miss Margland, and trusted she might be wrong; but he knew, too, her opportunities for observation, and dreaded lest she might be right. Camilla had been certainly low spirited, weeping, and restless; was it possible it could be for so slight, so unmeaning a cause? His wish was to follow her on horseback; but this, unauthorized, might betray too much anxiety: he tried not to think of what had been said by Dr. Marchmont, while this cloud hung over her disposition and sincerity; for whatever might be the malignity of Miss Margland, the breach of a promise, of which the voluntary sweetness had so lately proved his final captivation, could not be doubted, and called aloud for explanation.</p> 
<p>He mounted, however, his horse, to make his promised enquiries of Mrs. Needham; for though the time was already past for impeding the acquaintance from taking place, its progress might yet be stopt, should it be found incompatible with propriety.</p> 
<p>The young ladies had scarce left the Park, when Sir Hugh, recollecting a promise he had made to Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold, of never suffering Eugenia to go abroad unattended by some gentleman, while Bellamy remained in the country, sent hastily to beg that Edgar would follow the carriage.</p> 
<p>Edgar was out of sight, and there was no chance of overtaking him.</p> 
<p>‘Lack-a-day!’ said Sir Hugh, ‘those young folks can never walk a horse but full gallop!’ He then resolved to ask Dr. Orkborne to go after his pupil, and ride by the side of the chaise. He ordered a horse to be saddled; and, to lose no time by messages, the tardiness of which he had already experienced with this gentleman, he went himself to his apartment, and after several vain rappings at his door, entered the room unbid, saying–‘Good Dr. Orkborne, unless you are dead, which God forbid! I think it’s something uncomfortable that you can’t speak to a person waiting at your door; not that I pretend to doubt but you may have your proper reasons, being what I can’t judge.’</p> 
<p>He then begged he would get booted and spurred instantly, and follow his two nieces to Mrs. Arlbery’s , in order to take care of Eugenia; adding, ‘though I’m afraid, Doctor, by your look, you don’t much listen to me, which I am sorry for; my not being able to speak like Horace and Virgil being no fault of mine, but of my poor capacity, which no man can be said to be answerable for.’</p> 
<p>He then again entreated him to set off.</p> 
<p>‘Only a moment, sir! I only beg you’ll accord me one moment!’ cried the Doctor, with a fretful sigh; while, screening his eyes with his left hand, he endeavoured hastily to make a memorandum of his ideas, before he forced them to any other subject.</p> 
<p>‘Really, Dr. Orkborne,’ said Sir Hugh, somewhat displeased, ‘I must needs remark, for a friend, I think this rather slow: however, I can’t say I am much disappointed, now, that I did not turn out a scholar myself, for I see, plain enough, you learned men think nothing of any consequence but Homer and such; which, however, I don’t mean to take ill, knowing it was like enough to have been my own case.’</p> 
<p>He then left the room, intending to send a man and horse after the chaise, to desire his two nieces to return immediately.</p> 
<p>Dr. Orkborne, who, though copiously stored with the works of the ancients, had a sluggish understanding, and no imagination, was entirely overset by this intrusion. The chain of his observations was utterly broken; he strove vainly to rescue from oblivion the slow ripening fruits of his tardy conceptions, and, proportioning his estimation of their value by their labour, he not only considered his own loss as irreparable, but the whole world to be injured by so unfortunate an interruption.</p> 
<p>The recollection, however, which refused to assist his fame, was importunate in reminding him that the present offender was his patron; and his total want of skill in character kept from him the just confidence he would otherwise have placed in the unalterable goodness of heart of Sir Hugh, whom, though he despised for his ignorance, he feared for his power.</p> 
<p>Uneasy, therefore, at his exit, which he concluded to be made in wrath, he uttered a dolorous groan over his papers, and compelled himself to follow, with an apology, the innocent enemy of his glory.</p> 
<p>Sir Hugh, who never harboured displeasure for two minutes in his life, was more inclined to offer an excuse himself for what he had dropt against learning, than to resist the slightest concession from the Doctor, whom he only begged to make haste, the horse being already at the door. But Dr. Orkborne, as soon as he comprehended what was desired, revived from the weight of sacrificing so much time; he had never been on horseback since he was fifteen years of age, and declared, to the wondering baronet, he could not risk his neck by undertaking such a journey.</p> 
<p>In high satisfaction, he would then have returned to his room, persuaded that, when his mind was disembarrassed, a parallel between two ancient authors which, with much painful stretch of thought, he had suggested, and which, with the most elaborate difficulty, he was arranging and drawing up, would recur again to his memory: but Sir Hugh, always eager in expedients, said, he should follow in the coach, which might be ready time enough for him to arrive at Mrs. Arlbery’s before the visit was over, and to bring Eugenia safe back; ‘which,’ cried he, ‘is the main point, for the sake of seeing that she goes no where else.’</p> 
<p>Dr. Orkborne, looking extremely blank at this unexpected proposition, stood still.</p> 
<p>‘Won’t you go, then, my good friend?’</p> 
<p>The Doctor, after a long pause, and in a most dejected tone, sighed out, ‘Yes, sir, certainly, with the greatest alacrity.’</p> 
<p>Sir Hugh, who took everything literally that seemed right or good-natured, thanked him, and ordered the horses to be put to the coach with all possible expedition.</p> 
<p>It was soon at the door, and Dr. Orkborne, who had spent in his room the intervening period, in moaning the loss of the time that was to succeed, and in an opinion that two hours of this morning would have been of more value to him than two years when it was gone, reluctantly obeyed the call that obliged him to descend: but he had no sooner entered the carriage, and found he was to have it to himself, than leaping suddenly from it, as the groom, who was to attend him, was preparing to shut the door, he hastened back to his chamber to collect a packet of books and papers, through the means of which he hoped to recall those flowers of rhetoric, upon which he was willing to risk his future reputation.</p> 
<p>The astonished groom, concluding something had frightened him, jumped into the coach to find the cause of his flight; but Sir Hugh, who was advancing to give his final directions, called out, with some displeasure ‘Hollo, there, you Jacob! if Dr. Orkborne thinks to get you to go for my nieces in place of himself, it’s what I don’t approve; which, however, you need not take amiss, one man being no more born with a livery upon his back than another; which God forbid I should think otherwise. Nevertheless, my little girls must have a proper respect shewn them; which, it’s surprising Dr. Orkborne should not know as well as me.’</p> 
<p>And, much disconcerted, he walked to the parlour, to ruminate upon some other measure.</p> 
<p>‘I am sure, your honour,’ said Jacob, following him, ‘I got in with no ill intention; but what it was as come across the Doctor I don’t know; but just as I was a going to shut the door, without saying never a word, out he pops, and runs upstairs again; so I only got in to see if something had hurt him; but I can’t find nothing of no sort.’</p> 
<p>Then, putting to the door, and looking sagaciously, ‘Please your honour,’ he continued, ‘I dare say it’s only some maggot got into his brain from over reading and writing; for all the maids think he’ll soon be cracked.’</p> 
<p>‘That’s very wrong of them, Jacob; and I desire you’ll tell them they must not think any such thing.’</p> 
<p>‘Why, your honour don’t know half, or you’d be afraid too,’ said Jacob, lowering his voice; ‘he’s like nothing you ever see. He won’t let a chair nor a table be dusted in his room, though they are covered over with cobwebs, because he says, it takes him such a time to put his things to rights again; though all the while what he calls being to rights is just the contrary; for it’s a mere higgledy piggledy, one thing heaped o’top of t’other, as if he did it for fun.’</p> 
<p>The baronet gravely answered, that if there were not the proper shelves for his books he would order more.</p> 
<p>‘Why, your honour, that’s not the quarter, as I tell you! why, when they’re cleaning out his room, if they happen but to sweep away a bit of paper as big as my hand, he’ll make believe they’ve done him as much mischief as if they’d stole a thousand pound. It would make your honour stare to hear him. Mary says, she’s sure he has never been quite right ever since he come to the house.’</p> 
<p>‘But I desire you’ll tell Mary I don’t approve of that opinion. Dr. Orkborne is one of the first scholars in the world, as I am credibly informed; and I beg you’ll all respect him accordingly.’</p> 
<p>‘Why, your honour, if it i’n’t owing to something of that sort, why does he behave so unaccountable? I myself heard him making such a noise at the maids one day, that I spoke to Mary afterwards, and asked her what was the matter?–“Laws, nobody knows,” says she, “but here’s the Doctor been all in a huff again; I was just a dusting his desk (says she) and so I happened to wipe down a little bundle of papers, all nothing but mere scraps, and he took on as if they’d been so many guineas (says she) and he kept me there for an hour looking for them, and scolding, and telling such a heap of fibs, that if he was not out of his head, would be a shame for a gentleman to say” (says she).’</p> 
<p>‘Fie, fie, Jacob! and tell Mary fie, too. He is a very learned gentleman, and no more a story-teller than I am myself; which God forbid.’</p> 
<p>‘Why, your honour, how could this here be true? he told the maids how they had undone him, and the like, only because of their throwing down them few bits of papers; though they are ready to make oath they picked them up, almost every one; and that they were all of a crump, and of no manner of use.’</p> 
<p>‘Well, well, say no more about it, good Jacob, but go and give my compliments to Dr. Orkborne, and ask him, what’s the reason of his changing his mind; I mean, provided it’s no secret.’</p> 
<p>Jacob returned in two minutes, with uplifted hands and eyes; ‘your honour,’ cried he, ‘now you’ll believe me another time! he is worse than ever, and I’ll be bound he’ll break out before another quarter.’</p> 
<p>‘Why, what’s the matter?’</p> 
<p>‘Why, as sure as I’m here, he’s getting together ever so many books, and stuffing his pockets, and cramming them under his arms, just as if he was a porter! and when I gave him your honour’s message, I suppose it put him out, for he said, “Don’t hurry me so, I’m a coming;” making believe as if he was only a preparing for going out, in the stead of making that fool of himself.’</p> 
<p>Sir Hugh, now really alarmed, bid him not mention the matter to anyone; and was going upstairs himself, when he saw Dr. Orkborne, heavily laden with books in each hand, and bulging from both coat pockets, slowly and carefully coming down.</p> 
<p>‘Bless me,’ cried he, rather fearfully, ‘my dear sir, what are you going to do with all that library?’</p> 
<p>Dr. Orkborne, wishing him good morning, without attending to his question, proceeding to the carriage, calling to Jacob, who stood aloof, to make haste and open the door.</p> 
<p>Jacob obeyed, but with a significant look at his master, that said, ‘you see how it is, sir!’</p> 
<p>Sir Hugh following him, gently put his hand upon his shoulder, and mildly said, ‘My dear friend, to be sure you know best, but I don’t see the use of loading yourself in that manner for nothing.’</p> 
<p>‘It is a great loss of time, sir, to travel without books,’ answered the Doctor, quietly arranging them in the coach.</p> 
<p>‘Travel, my good friend? Why, you don’t call it travelling to go four or five miles? why, if you had known me before my fall–However, I don’t mean to make any comparisons, you gentlemen scholars being no particular good horsemen. However, if you were to go one hundred miles instead of four or five, you could not get through more than one of those books, read as hard as you please; unless you skip half, which I suppose you solid heads leave to the lower ignoramusses.’</p> 
<p>‘It is not for reading, sir, that I take all these books, but merely to look into. There are many of them I shall never read in my life, but I shall want them all.’</p> 
<p>Sir Hugh now stared with increased perplexity; but Dr. Orkborne, as eager to go, since his books were to accompany him, as before to stay, told Jacob to bid the coachman make haste. Jacob looked at his master, who ordered him to mount his mare, and the carriage drove off.</p> 
<p>The baronet, in some uneasiness, seated himself in the hall, to ruminate upon what he had just heard. The quietness and usual manner of speaking and looking of Dr. Orkborne, which he had remarked, removed any immediate apprehensions from the assertions of Jacob and Mary; but still he did not like the suggestion; and the carrying off so many books, when he acknowledged he did not mean to read one of them, disturbed him.</p> 
<p>In every shadow of perplexity, his first wish was to consult with his brother; and if he had not parted with both his carriages, he would instantly have set off for Etherington. He sent, however, an express for Mr. Tyrold, begging to see him at Cleves with all speed.</p>
