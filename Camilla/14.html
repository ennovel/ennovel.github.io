Sir Hugh readily consented, blaming her for supposing it possible he could ever hesitate in what could give her any pleasure.</p> 
<p>Before the tea-party broke up, Edgar returned. He told Camilla he had stolen away the instant the dinner was over, to avoid any mistake about the poor people, whom he had just overtaken by the park-gate, and conducted to the great barn, where he had directed them to wait for orders.</p> 
<p>‘I’ll run to them immediately,’ cried she, ‘for my half guinea is in an agony to be gone!’</p> 
<p>‘The barn! my dear young Mr. Mandlebert!’ exclaimed Sir Hugh; ‘and why did you not bring them to the servants’ hall? My little girl has been telling me all their history; and, God forbid, I should turn hard-hearted, because of their wanting a leg of mutton, in preference to being starved; though they might have no great right to it, according to the forms of law; which, however, is not much impediment to the calls of nature, when a man sees a butcher’s stall well covered, and has got nothing within him, except his own poor craving appetite; which is a thing I always take into consideration; though, God forbid, I should protect a thief, no man’s property being another’s, whether he’s poor or rich.’</p> 
<p>He then gave Camilla three guineas to deliver to them from himself, to set them a little a-going in an honest way, that they might not, he said, repent leaving off bad actions. Her joy was so excessive, that she passionately embraced his knees: and Edgar, while he looked on, could nearly have bent to her his own, with admiration of her generous nature. Eugenia desired to accompany her; and Indiana, rising also, said: ‘Dear! I wonder how they will look in the barn! I should like to see them too.’</p> 
<p>Miss Margland made no opposition, and they set out.</p> 
<p>Camilla, leading the way, with a fleetness that mocked all equality, ran into the barn, and saw the whole party, according to their several powers, enjoying themselves. The poor man, stretched upon straw, was resting his aching limbs; his wife, by his side, was giving nourishment to her baby; and the other child, a little boy of three years old, was jumping and turning head over heels, with the true glee of unspoilt nature, superior to poverty and distress.</p> 
<p>To the gay heart of Camilla whatever was sportive was attractive; she flew to the little fellow, whose skin was clean and bright, in the midst of his rags and wretchedness, and, making herself his play-mate, bid the woman finish feeding her child, told the man to repose himself undisturbed, and began dancing with the little boy, not less delighted than himself at the festive exercise.</p> 
<p>Miss Margland cast up her hands and eyes as she entered, and poured forth a warm remonstrance against so demeaning a condescension: but Camilla, in whose composition pride had no share, though spirit was a principal ingredient, danced on unheeding, to the equal amaze and enchantment of the poor man and woman, at the honour done to their little son.</p> 
<p>Edgar came in last; he had given his arm to Eugenia, who was always in the rear if unassisted. Miss Margland appealed to him upon the impropriety of the behaviour of Camilla, adding, ‘If I had had the bringing up a young lady who could so degrade herself, I protest I should blush to shew my face: but you cannot, I am sure, fail remarking the difference of Miss Lynmere’s conduct.’</p> 
<p>Edgar attended with an air of complacency, which he thought due to the situation of Miss Margland in the family, yet kept his eyes fixt upon Camilla, with an expression that, to the least discernment, would have evinced his utmost approbation of her his innocent gaiety: but Miss Margland was amongst that numerous tribe, who, content as well as occupied with making observations upon others, have neither the power, nor thought, of developing those that are returned upon themselves.</p> 
<p>Camilla at length, wholly out of breath, gave over; but perceiving that the baby was no longer at its mother’s breast, flew to the poor woman, and, taking the child in her arms, said: ‘Come, I can nurse and rest at the same time; I assure you the baby will be safe with me, for I nurse all the children in our neighbourhood.’ She then fondled the poor little half-starved child to her bosom, quieting, and kissing, and cooing over it.</p> 
<p>Miss Margland was still more incensed; but Edgar could attend to her no longer. Charmed with the youthful nurse, and seeing in her unaffected attitudes, a thousand graces he had never before remarked, and reading in her fondness for children the genuine sweetness of her character, he could not bear to have the pleasing reflections revolving in his mind interrupted by the spleen of Miss Margland, and, slipping away, posted himself behind the baby’s father, where he could look on undisturbed, certain it was a vicinity to which Miss Margland would not follow him.</p> 
<p>Had this scene lasted till Camilla was tired, its period would not have been very short; but Miss Margland, finding her exhortations vain, suddenly called out: ‘Miss Lynmere! Miss Eugenia! come away directly! It’s ten to one but these people have all got the gaol distemper!’</p> 
<p>Edgar, quick as lightning at this sound, flew to Camilla, and snatched the child from her arms. Indiana, with a scream, ran out of the barn; Miss Margland hurried after; and Eugenia, following, earnestly entreated Camilla not to stay another moment.</p> 
<p>‘And what is there to be alarmed at?’ cried she; ‘I always nurse poor children when I see them at home; and my father never prohibits me.’</p> 
<p>‘There may be some reason, however,’ said Edgar, while still he tenderly held the baby himself, ‘for the present apprehension: I beg you, therefore, to hasten away.’</p> 
<p>‘At least,’ said she, ‘before I depart, let me execute my commission.’ And then, with the kindest good wishes for their better fortune, she put her uncle’s three guineas into the hands of the poor man, and her own rescued half guinea into those of his wife; and, desiring Edgar not to remain himself where he would not suffer her to stay, ran to give her arm to Eugenia; leaving it a doubtful point, whether the good humour accompanying her alms, made the most pleased impression upon their receivers, or upon their observer.</p>
