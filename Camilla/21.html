<p>Before they set out, Edgar desired to speak with Sir Hugh in private.</p> 
<p>Sir Hugh concluded it was to make his proposals of marriage for Indiana; and had not patience to step into his own apartment, but told them all to retire, with a nod at Indiana, which prepared not only herself but Miss Margland, Camilla, and Eugenia to join in his expectation.</p> 
<p>Indiana, though a good deal fluttered, flew to a window, to see if the new chariot was in sight; and then, turning to Miss Margland, asked, ‘Pray, should I refuse him at first?’</p> 
<p>Miss Margland spared not for proper instructions; and immediately began a negociation with the fair questioner, for continuing to live with her.</p> 
<p>Eugenia was occupied in reflecting with pity upon the idleness of Indiana, which so ill had fitted her for becoming the companion of Mandlebert.</p> 
<p>Camilla, unusually thoughtful, walked alone into the garden, and sought a path least in sight.</p> 
<p>Sir Hugh, meanwhile, was most unpleasantly undeceived. Edgar, without naming Indiana, informed him of the situation in which he had surprised Bellamy, and of his suspicions with regard to the destination of the chaise, but for his own timely arrival at the farm-house; adding, that his gratitude to Mr. Tyrold, his respect for himself, and his affection for all the family, made him think it is duty to reveal these circumstances without delay.</p> 
<p>The baronet shuddered with horror; and declared he would instantly send an express to bring Clermont home, that Eugenia might be married out of hand; and, in the mean time, that he would have every window in the house barred, and keep her locked up in her room.</p> 
<p>Edgar dissuaded him from so violent a measure; but advised him to speak with his niece upon the danger she had probably escaped, and of which she seemed wholly unconscious; to prevail with her not to go out again this evening, and to send for Mr. Tyrold, and acquaint him with the affair.</p> 
<p>Sir Hugh thanked him for his counsel, and implicitly acted by his opinion.</p> 
<p>He then ordered the coach for Miss Margland, Indiana, and Camilla.</p> 
<p>Dr. Orkborne, finding neither Sir Hugh nor Eugenia of the party, declined joining it. Lionel was returned to Etherington; and Edgar rode on before, to invite Dr. Marchmont, with the consent of the Baronet, to take the fourth place in the carriage.</p> 
<p>Arrived at the rectory, he went straight, by prescriptive privilege, into the study of Dr. Marchmont, whom he found immersed in books and papers, which, immediately, at the request of Edgar, he put aside; not without regret to quit them, though wholly without reluctance to oblige.</p> 
<p>Edgar had ridden so hard, that they had some time to wait for the coach. But he did not appear anxious for its arrival; though he wore a look that was far from implying him to be free from anxiety.</p> 
<p>He was silent,-he hemmed,-he was silent again,-and again he hemmed,-and then, gently laying his hand upon the shoulder of the Doctor, while his eyes, full of meaning, were fixed upon his face; ‘Doctor,’ he cried, ‘you would hardly have known these young ladies?-they are all grown from children into women since you saw them last.’</p> 
<p>‘Yes,’ answered the Doctor, ‘and very charming women. Indiana has a beauty so exquisite, it is scarce possible to look away from it a moment: Eugenia joins so much innocence with information, that the mind must itself be deformed that could dwell upon her personal defects, after conversing with her: Camilla’–</p> 
<p>He paused, and Edgar hastily turned another way, not to look at him, nor be looked at, while he proceeded:</p> 
<p>‘Camilla,’ he presently continued, ‘seems the most inartificially sweet, the most unobtrusively gay, and the most attractively lovely of almost any young creature I ever beheld.’</p> 
<p>With a heart all expanded, and a face full of sensibility, Edgar now turned to him, and seizing, involuntarily, his hand, which he eagerly shook, ‘You think her; then,’-he cried,-but suddenly stopt, dropt his hand, coughed two or three times; and, taking out his pocket handkerchief, seemed tormented with a violent cold.</p> 
<p>Dr. Marchmont affectionately embraced him. ‘My dear young friend,’ he cried, ‘I see the situation of your mind-and think every possible happiness promises to be yours; yet, if you have taken no positive step, suffer me to speak with you before you proceed.’</p> 
<p>‘Far from having taken any positive step, I have not yet even formed any resolution.’</p> 
<p>Here the carriage stopt for the Doctor, who repeated, ‘Yes! I think every possible happiness promises to be yours!’ before he went on to the ladies. Edgar, in a trepidation too great to be seen by them, kept behind till they drove off, though he then galloped so fast, that he arrived at the cottage before them: the words, ‘I think every possible happiness promises to be yours,’ vibrating the whole time in his ears.</p> 
<p>When the coach arrived, Edgar handed out Miss Margland and Indiana; leaving Camilla to the Doctor; willing to let him see more of her, and by no means displeased to avoid his eyes at that moment himself.</p> 
<p>Indiana was in the most sprightly spirits she had ever experienced; she concluded herself on the verge of becoming mistress of a fine place and a large fortune; she had received adulation all the morning that had raised her beauty higher than ever in her own estimation; and she secretly revolved, with delight, various articles of ornament and of luxury, which she had long wished to possess, and which now, for her wedding clothes, she should have riches sufficient to purchase.</p> 
<p>Miss Margland, too, was all smoothness, complacency, and courtesy.</p> 
<p>Camilla, alone, was grave; Camilla, who, by nature, was gay.</p> 
<p>‘Dear! is this the cottage we have been coming to all this time?’ cried Indiana, upon entering; ‘Lord! I thought it would have been something quite pretty.’</p> 
<p>‘And what sort of prettiness,’ said Edgar, ‘did you expect from a cottage?’</p> 
<p>‘Dear, I don’t know-but I thought we were come on purpose to see something extraordinary?’</p> 
<p>Camilla, who followed, made an exclamation far different; an exclamation of pleasure, surprise, and vivacity, that restored for an instant, all her native gaiety: for no sooner had she crossed the threshold, than she recognised, in a woman who was curtsying low to receive her, and whom Indiana had passed without observing, the wife of the poor prisoner for whom she had interceded with Mandlebert.</p> 
<p>‘How I rejoice to see you!’ cried she, ‘and to see you here! and how much better you look! and how comfortable you seem! I hope you are now all well?’</p> 
<p>‘Ah, madam,’ answered the woman; ‘we owe everything to that good young gentleman! he has put us in this nice new cottage, and employs us in his service. Blessings on his head! I am sure he will be paid for it!’</p> 
<p>Edgar, somewhat agitated, occupied himself with jumping the little boy; Camilla looked round with rapture; Indiana seemed wonder-struck, without knowing why; Dr. Marchmont narrowly watched them all; and Miss Margland, expecting a new collection would be next proposed for setting them up, nimbly re-crossed the threshold, to examine the prospect without.</p> 
<p>The husband, now in decent garb, and much recovered, though still weak and emaciated, advanced to Camilla, to make his humble acknowledgments, that she had recommended them to their kind benefactor.</p> 
<p>‘No!’ cried Camilla; ‘you owe me nothing! your own distress recommended you;-your own distress-and Mr. Mandlebert’s generosity.’</p> 
<p>Then, going up to Edgar, ‘It is your happy fate,’ she said, in an accent of admiration, ‘to act all that my father so often plans and wishes, but which his income will not allow him to execute.’</p> 
<p>‘You see,’ answered he, gratefully, ‘how little suffices for content! I have scarce done anything-yet how relieved, how satisfied are these poor people! This hut was fortunately vacant’–</p> 
<p>‘O, madam!’ interrupted the poor woman, ‘if you knew but how that good gentleman has done it all! how kindly he has used us, and made everybody else use us! and let nobody taunt us with our bad faults!-and what good he has done to my poor sick husband! and how he has clothed my poor little half naked children! and, what is more than all, saved us from the shame of an ill life.’–</p> 
<p>Camilla felt the tears start into her eyes;-she hastily snatched the little babe into her arms; and, while her kisses hid her face, Happy, and thrice happy Indiana! with a soft sigh, was the silent ejaculation of her heart.</p> 
<p>She seated herself on a stool, and, without speaking or hearing any thing more, devoted herself to the baby.</p> 
<p>Indiana, meanwhile, whose confidence in her own situation gave her courage to utter whatever first occurred to her, having made a general survey of the place and people, with an air of disappointment, now amused herself with an inspection more minute, taking up and casting down everything that was portable, without any regard either to deranging its neatness, or endangering its safety:-exclaiming, as she made her round of investigation, ‘Dear! Crockery ware! how ugly!–Lord, what little mean chairs!–Is that your best gown, good woman?– Dear, what an ugly pattern!–Well, I would not wear such a thing to save my life!–Have you got nothing better than this for a floor-cloth? Only look at those curtains! Did you ever see such frights? Lord! do you eat off these platters? I am sure I could sooner die! I should not mind starving half as much!’</p> 
<p>Miss Margland, hoping the collection was now either made or relinquished, ventured to re-enter, and inquire if they never meant to return home? Camilla unwillingly gave up the baby; but would not depart without looking over the cottage, where everything she saw excited a sensation of pleasure. ‘How neat is this! How tidy is that!’ were her continual exclamations; ‘How bright you have rubbed your saucepans! How clean every thing is all round! How soon you will all get well in this healthy and comfortable little dwelling!’</p> 
<p>Edgar, in a low voice, then told Dr. Marchmont the history of his new cottagers, saying: ‘You will not, I hope, disapprove what I have done? Their natures seemed so much disposed to good, I could not bear to let their wants turn them again to evil.’</p> 
<p>‘You have certainly done right,’ answered the Doctor; ‘to give money without inquiry, or further aid, to those who have adopted bad practices, is, to them, but temptation, and to society an injury; but to give them both the counsel and the means to pursue a right course, is, to them, perhaps, salvation, and to the community, the greatest service.”</p> 
<p>Indiana and Miss Margland, quite wearied, both got into the carriage; Edgar, having deposited them, returned to Camilla, who kissed both the children, poured forth good wishes upon the father and mother; and, then, gave him her hand. Enchanted, he took it, exclaiming; ‘Ah! who is like you! so lively-yet so feeling!’</p> 
<p>Struck and penetrated, she made no answer: Alas! she thought, I fear he is not quite satisfied with Indiana!</p> 
<p>Dr. Marchmont was set down at his own house; where, he begged to have a conference with Edgar the next morning.</p> 
<p>The whole way home, the benevolence of Edgar occupied the mind of Camilla; and, not in the present instance, the less, that its object had been originally of her own pointing out.</p>
