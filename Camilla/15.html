<p>She opened it with an air of exulting consequence; one which was inclosed, she put into her pocket, and read the other three or four times over, with looks of importance and complacency. She then pompously demanded a private audience with Sir Hugh, and the young party left the room.</p> 
<p>‘Well, sir!’ she cried, proudly, ‘you may now see if I judged right as to taking the young ladies a little into the world. Please to look at this letter, sir:’</p> 
<p>To Miss Margland, at Sir Hugh Tyrold’s , Bart., Cleves, Hampshire.</p> 
<p>MADAM,</p> 
<p>WITH the most profound respect I presume to address you, though only upon the strength of that marked politeness which shines forth in your deportment. I have the highest ambition to offer a few lines to the perusal of Miss Eugenia Tyrold, previous to presenting myself to Sir Hugh. My reasons will be contained in the letter which I take the liberty to put into your hands. It is only under your protection, madam, I can aim at approaching that young lady, as all that I have either seen or heard convinces me of her extraordinary happiness in being under your direction. Your influence, madam, I should therefore esteem as an honour, and I leave it wholly to your own choice, whether to read what I have addressed to that young lady before or after she has deigned to cast an eye upon it herself. I remain, with the most profound respect,</p> 
<p>Madam,</p> 
<p>your most obedient, and obliged servant,</p> 
<p>ALPHONSO BELLAMY.</p> 
<p>I shall take the liberty to send my servant for an answer tomorrow evening.</p> 
<p>‘This, sir,’ continued Miss Margland, when Sir Hugh had read the letter; ‘this is the exact conduct of a gentleman; all open, all respectful. No attempt at any clandestine intercourse. All is addressed where it ought to be, to the person most proper to superintend such an affair. This is that very same gentleman whose politeness I mentioned to you, and who danced with Miss Eugenia at Northwick, when nobody else took any notice of her. This is–’</p> 
<p>‘Why then this is one of the most untoward things,’ cried Sir Hugh, who, vainly waiting for a pause, began to speak without one, ‘that has ever come to bear; for where’s the use of Eugenia’s making poor young fellows fall in love with her for nothing? which I hold to be a pity, provided it’s sincere, which I take for granted.’</p> 
<p>‘As to that, sir, I can’t say I see the reason why Miss Eugenia should not be allowed to look about her, and have some choice; especially as the young gentleman abroad has no fortune; at least none answerable to her expectations.’</p> 
<p>‘But that’s the very reason for my marrying them together. For as he has not had the small-pox himself, that is, not in the natural way; which, Lord help me! I thought the best, owing to my want of knowledge; why he’ll the more readily excuse her face not being one of the prettiest, for her kindness in putting up with his having so little money; being a thing some people think a good deal of.’</p> 
<p>‘But, sir, won’t it be very hard upon poor Miss Eugenia, if a better offer should come, that she must not listen to it, only because of a person she has never seen, though he has no estate?’</p> 
<p>‘Mrs. Margland,’ said Sir Hugh, (with some heat,) ‘this is the very thing that I would sooner have given a crown than have had happen! Who knows but Eugenia may take a fancy to this young jackanapes? who, for aught I know, may be as good a man as another, for which I beg his pardon; but, as he is nothing to me, and my nephew’s my nephew, why am I to have the best scheme I ever made knocked on the head, for a person I had as lieve were twitched into the Red Sea? which, however, is a thing I should not say, being what I would not do.’</p> 
<p>Miss Margland took from her pocket the letter designed for Eugenia, and was going to break the seal; but Sir Hugh, preventing her, said: ‘No, Miss Margland; Eugenia shall read her own letters. I have not had her taught all this time, by one of the first scholars of the age, as far as I can tell, to put that affront upon her.’</p> 
<p>He then rang the bell, and sent for Eugenia.</p> 
<p>Miss Margland stated the utter impropriety of suffering any young lady to read a letter of that sort, till proposals had been laid before her parents and guardians. But Sir Hugh spoke no more till Eugenia appeared.</p> 
<p>‘My dear,’ he then said, ‘here is a letter just come to put your education to the trial; which, I make no doubt, will stand the test properly: therefore, in regard to the answer, you shall write it all yourself, being qualified in a manner to which I have no right to pretend; though I shall go to-morrow to my brother, which will give me a better insight; his head being one of the best.’</p> 
<p>Eugenia, greatly surprised, opened the letter, and read it with visible emotion.</p> 
<p>‘Well, my dear, and what do you say to it?’</p> 
<p>Without answering, she read it again.</p> 
<p>Sir Hugh repeated the question.</p> 
<p>‘Indeed, sir,’ said she, (in a tone of sadness,) ‘it is something that afflicts me very much!’</p> 
<p>‘Lord help us!’ cried Sir Hugh, ‘this comes of going to a ball! which, begging Miss Margland’s pardon, is the last time it shall be done.’</p> 
<p>Miss Margland was beginning a vehement defence of herself; but Sir Hugh interrupted it, by desiring to see the letter.</p> 
<p>Eugenia, with increased confusion, folded it up, and said: ‘Indeed, sir–Indeed, uncle-it is a very improper letter for me to shew.’</p> 
<p>‘Well, that,’ cried Miss Margland, ‘is a thing I could never have imagined! that a gentleman, who is so much the gentleman, should write an improper letter!’</p> 
<p>‘No, no,’ interrupted she, ‘not improper-perhaps-for him to write,-but for me to exhibit.’</p> 
<p>‘O, if that’s all, my dear ‘ said Sir Hugh ‘if it’s only because of a few compliments, I beg you not to mind them, because of their having no meaning; which is a thing common enough in the way of making love, by what I hear; though such a young thing as you can know nothing of the matter, your learning not going in that line; nor Dr. Orkborne’s neither, if one may judge; which, God forbid I should find fault with, being no business of mine.’</p> 
<p>He then again asked to see the letter; and Eugenia, ashamed to refuse, gave it, and went out of the room.</p> 
<p>To Miss Eugenia Tyrold, Cleves.</p> 
<p>MADAM,</p> 
<p>THE delicacy of your highly cultivated mind awes even the violent passion which you inspire. And to this I entreat you to attribute the trembling fear which deters me from the honour of waiting upon Sir Hugh, while uncertain, if my addressing him might not raise your displeasure. I forbear, therefore, to lay before him my pretensions for soliciting your favour, from the deepest apprehension you might think I presumed too far, upon an acquaintance, to my unhappiness, so short; yet, as I feel it to have excited in me the most lasting attachment, from my fixed admiration of your virtues and talents, I cannot endure to run the risk of incurring your aversion. Allow me then, once more, under the sanction of that excellent lady in whose care I have had the honour of seeing you, to entreat one moment’s audience, that I may be graced with your own commands about waiting upon Sir Hugh, without which, I should hold myself ungenerous and unworthy to approach him; since I should blush to throw myself at your feet from an authority which you do not permit. I beseech you, madam, to remember, that I shall be miserable till I know my doom; but still, that the heart, not the hand, can alone bestow happiness on a disinterested mind.</p> 
<p>I have the honour to be,</p> 
<p>Madam,</p> 
<p>your most devoted and obedient humble servant,</p> 
<p>ALPHONSO BELLAMY.</p> 
<p>Sir Hugh, when he had finished the letter, heaved a sigh, and leant his head upon his hand, considering whether or not to let it be seen by Miss Margland; who, however, not feeling secure what his determination might be, had so contrived to sit at the table as to read it at the same time with himself. Nor had she weighed the interest of her curiosity amiss; Sir Hugh, dreading a debate with her, soon put the letter into his pocket-book, and again sent for Eugenia.</p> 
<p>Eugenia excused herself from returning, pleaded a head-ache, and went to bed.</p> 
<p>Sir Hugh was in the deepest alarm; though the evening was far advanced, he could scarce refrain from going to Etherington directly; he ordered his carriage to be at the door at eight o’clock the next morning; and sent a second order, a moment after, that it should not be later than half past seven.</p> 
<p>He then summoned Camilla, and, giving her the letter, bid her run with it to her sister, for fear it was that she was fretting for. And soon after, he went to bed, that he might be ready in the morning.</p> 
<p>Eugenia, meanwhile, felt the placid composure of her mind now for the first time shaken. The assiduities of this young man had already pleased and interested her; but, though gratified by them in his presence, they occurred to her no more in his absence. With the Oxonian she had been far more struck; his energy, his sentiments, his passion for literature, would instantly have riveted him in her fairest favour, had she not so completely regarded herself as the wife of Clermont Lynmere, that she denied her imagination any power over her reason.</p> 
<p>This letter, however, filled her with sensations wholly new. She now first reflected seriously upon the nature of her situation with regard to Clermont, for whom she seemed bespoken by her uncle, without the smallest knowledge how they might approve or suit each other. Perhaps he might dislike her; she must then have the mortification of being refused: perhaps he might excite her own antipathy; she must then either disappoint her uncle, or become a miserable sacrifice.</p> 
<p>Here, on the contrary, she conceived herself an elected object. The difference of being accepted, or being chosen, worked forcibly upon her mind; and, all that was delicate, feminine, or dignified in her notions, rose in favour of him who sought, when opposed to him who could only consent to receive her. Generous, too, he appeared to her, in forbearing to apply to Sir Hugh, without her permission; disinterested, in declaring he did not wish for her hand without her heart: and noble, in not seeking her in a clandestine manner, but referring every thing to Miss Margland.</p> 
<p>The idea also of exciting an ardent passion, lost none of its force from its novelty to her expectations. It was not that she had hitherto supposed it impossible; she had done less; she had not thought of it all. Nor came it now with any triumph to her modest and unassuming mind; all it brought with it was gratitude towards Bellamy, and a something soothing towards herself, which, though inexplicable to her reason, was irresistible to her feelings.</p> 
<p>When Camilla entered with the letter, she bashfully asked her, if she wished to read it? Camilla eagerly cried: ‘O, yes.’ But, having finished it, said: ‘It is not such a letter as Edgar Mandlebert would have written.’</p> 
<p>‘I am sure, then,’ said Eugenia, colouring, ‘I am sorry to have received it.’</p> 
<p>‘Do you not observe every day,’ said Camilla, ‘the distance, the delicacy of his behaviour to Indiana, though Miss Margland says their marriage is fixed; how free from all distinction that might confuse her? This declaration, on the contrary, is so abrupt-and from so new an acquaintance–’</p> 
<p>‘Certainly, then, I won’t answer it,’ said Eugenia, much discomposed; ‘it had not struck me thus at first reading; but I see now all its impropriety.’</p> 
<p>She then bid good night to Camilla; who, concluding her the appropriated wife of Clermont, had uttered her opinion without scruple.</p> 
<p>Eugenia now again read the letter; but not again with pleasure. She thought it forward and presumptuous; and the only gratification that remained upon her mind, was an half conscious scarce admitted, and, even to herself, unacknowledged charm, in a belief, that she possessed the power to inspire an animated regard.</p>
