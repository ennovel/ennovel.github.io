Edgar felt a momentary disappointment that she did not honour his flowers with wearing them; but consoled himself with supposing she had preserved them in water. In a few minutes, however, Indiana appeared with them in her bosom.</p> 
<p>Almost petrified, he turned towards Camilla, who, affecting an air of unconcern, amused herself with patting a favourite old terrier of her uncle’s .</p> 
<p>As soon as he could disengage himself from the Baronet, he leant also over the dog, and, in a low voice, said–‘You have discarded, then, my poor flowers?’</p> 
<p>‘Have I not done right?’ answered she, in the same tone; ‘are they not where you must be far happier to see them?’</p> 
<p>‘Is it possible,’ exclaimed he, ‘Miss Camilla Tyrold can suppose–’. He stopt, for surprised off his guard, he was speaking loud, and he saw Miss Margland approaching.</p> 
<p>‘Don’t you think, Mr. Mandlebert,’ said she, ‘that Miss Lynmere becomes a bouquet very much? she took a fancy to those flowers, and I think they are quite the thing for her.’</p> 
<p>‘She does them,’ he coldly answered, ‘too much honour.’</p> 
<p>Ah, Heaven! he loves her not! thought Camilla, and, while trembling between hope and terror at the suggestion, determined to redouble her circumspection, not to confirm the suspicion that his indifference was produced by her efforts to attach him to herself.</p> 
<p>She had soon what she conceived to be an occasion for its exertion. When he handed her some cakes, he said–‘You would think it, I conclude, impertinent to hear anything more concerning Mrs. Arlbery, now you have positively opened an acquaintance with her?’</p> 
<p>She felt the justice of this implied reproach of her broken promise; but she saw herself constantly watched by Miss Margland, and repressing the apology she was sighing to offer, only answered–‘You have nothing, you own, to say against her reputation-and as to any thing else–’</p> 
<p>‘True,’ interrupted he, ‘my information on that point is all still in her favour: but can it be Miss Camilla Tyrold, who holds that to be the sole question upon which intimacy ought to depend? Does she account as nothing manners, disposition, way of life?’</p> 
<p>‘No, not absolutely as nothing,’ said she, rising; ‘but taste settles all those things, and mine is entirely in her favour.’</p> 
<p>Edgar gravely begged her pardon, for so officiously resuming an irksome subject; and returning to Sir Hugh, endeavoured to listen to his lamentations and conjectures about Dr. Orkborne.</p> 
<p>He felt, however, deeply hurt. In naming Mrs. Arlbery, he had flattered himself he had opened an opportunity for which she must herself be waiting, to explain the motives of her late visit; but her light answer put an end to that hope, and her quitting her seat shewed her impatient of further counsel.</p> 
<p>Not a word that fell from Sir Hugh reached his ear: but he bowed from time to time, and the good Baronet had no doubt of his attention. His eyes were perpetually following Camilla, though they met not a glance from her in return. She played with the terrier, talked with Eugenia, looked out of the window, turned over some books, and did everything with an air of negligence, that while it covered absence and anxiety, displayed a studied avoidance of his notice.</p> 
<p>The less he could account for this, the more it offended him. And dwells caprice, thought he, while his eye followed her, even there! in that fair composition!-where may I look for singleness of mind, for nobleness of simplicity, if caprice, mere girlish, unmeaning caprice, dwell there!</p> 
<p>The moment she had finished her tea, she left the room, to shorten her cruel task. Struck with the broken sentence of ‘is it possible Miss Camilla Tyrold can suppose–’ the soft hope that his heart was untouched by Indiana, seized her delighted imagination; but the recollection of Miss Margland’s assertions, that it was the real right of her cousin, soon robbed the hope of all happiness, and she could only repeat–To-morrow I will go!–I ought not to think of him!–I had rather be away-to-morrow I will go!</p> 
<p>She had hardly quitted the parlour, when the distant sound of a carriage roused Sir Hugh from his fears; and, followed by Edgar and the ladies, he made what haste he could into the courtyard, where, to his infinite satisfaction, he saw his coach driving in.</p> 
<p>He ordered it should stop immediately, and called out–‘Pray, Dr. Orkborne, are you there?’</p> 
<p>Dr. Orkborne looked out of the window, and bowed respectfully.</p> 
<p>‘Good lack, I could never have thought I should be so glad to see you! which you must excuse, in point of being no relation. You are heartily welcome, I assure you; I was afraid I should never see you again; for, to tell you the honest truth, which I would not say a word of before, I had got a notion you were going out of your mind.’</p> 
<p>The Doctor took not the smallest heed of his speech, and the carriage drove up to the door. Sir Hugh then seating himself under the portico, said–‘Pray, Dr. Orkborne, before you go to your studies, may I just ask you how you came to stay out all day? and why you never fetched Eugenia? for I take it for granted it’s no secret, on the account Jacob was with you; besides the coachman and horses.’</p> 
<p>Dr. Orkborne, though not at all discomposed by these questions, nor by his reception, answered, that he must first collect his books.</p> 
<p>‘The poor girls,’ continued the Baronet, ‘came home quite blank; not that they knew a word of my asking you to go for them, till I told them; which was lucky enough, for the sake of not frightening them. However, where you can have been, particularly with regard to your dinner, which, I suppose, you have gone without, is what I can’t guess; unless you’d be kind enough to tell me.’</p> 
<p>The Doctor, too busy to hear him, was packing up his books.</p> 
<p>‘Come, never mind your books,’ said Sir Hugh; ‘Jacob can carry them for you, or Bob, or any body. Here, Bob, (calling to the postillion, who, with all the rest of the servants, had been drawn by curiosity into the courtyard) whisk me up those books, and take them into the Doctor’s room; I mean, provided you can find a place for them, which I am sorry to say there is none; owing to my not knowing better in point of taking the proper care; which I shall be sure to do for the future.’</p> 
<p>The boy obeyed, and mounting one step of the coach, took what were within his reach; which, when the Doctor observed, he snatched away with great displeasure, saying, very solemnly, he had rather at any time be knocked down, than see any body touch one of his books or papers.</p> 
<p>Jacob, coming forward, whispered his master not to interfere; assuring him, he was but just got out of one of his tantarums.</p> 
<p>Sir Hugh, a little startled, rose to return to the parlour, begging Dr. Orkborne to take his own time, and not hurry himself.</p> 
<p>He then beckoned Jacob to follow him.</p> 
<p>‘There is certainly something in all this,’ said he to Edgar, ‘beyond what my poor wit can comprehend: but I’ll hear what Jacob has to say before I form a complete judgment; though, to be sure, his lugging out all those books to go but four or five miles, has but an odd look; which is what I don’t like to say.’</p> 
<p>Jacob now was called upon to give a narrative of the day’s adventures. ‘Why, your Honour,’ said he, ‘as soon as we come to the Grove, I goes up to the coach door, to ask the Doctor if he would get out, or only send in to let the young ladies know he was come for them; but he was got so deep into some of his larning, that, I dare say, I bawled it three good times in his ears, before he so much as lifted up his head; and then it was only to say, I put him out! and to it he went again, just as if I’d said never a word; till, at last, I was so plaguy mad, I gives the coach such a jog, to bring him to himself like, that it jerked the pencil and paper out of his hand. So then he went straight into one of his takings, pretending I had made him forget all his thoughts, and such like out of the way talk, after his old way. So when I found he was going off in that manner, I thought it only time lost to say no more to him, and so I turned me about not to mind him; when I sees a whole heap of company at a parlour window, laughing so hearty, that I was sure they had heard us. And a fine comely lady, as clever as ever you see, that I found after was the lady of the house, bid me come to the window, and asked what I wanted. So I told her we was come for two of the Miss Tyrolds. Why, says she, they’ve been gone a quarter of an hour, by the opposite road. So then I was coming away, but she made me a sign to come into the parlour, for all it was brimful of fine company, dressed all like I don’t know what. It was as pretty a sight as you’d wish to see. And then, your honour, they all begun upon me at once! there was such a clatter, I thought I’d been turned into a booth at a fair; and merry enough they all was sure!–‘specially the lady, who never opened her lips, but what they all laughed: but as to all what they asked me, I could as soon conjure a ghost as call a quarter of it to mind.’</p> 
<p>‘Try, however,’ said Edgar, curious for further information of whatever related to Mrs. Arlbery.</p> 
<p>‘Why as to that, ‘squire,’ answered Jacob, with an arch look, ‘I am not so sure and certain you’d like to hear it all.’</p> 
<p>‘No? and why not?’</p> 
<p>‘O! pray tell, Jacob,’ cried Miss Margland; ‘did they say anything of Mr. Mandlebert?’</p> 
<p>‘Yes, and of more than Mr. Mandlebert,’ said Jacob, grinning.</p> 
<p>‘Do tell, do tell,’ cried Indiana, eagerly.</p> 
<p>‘I’m afeard, Miss!’</p> 
<p>Every body assured him no offence should be taken.</p> 
<p>‘Well, then, if you must needs know, there was not one of you, but what they had a pluck at.–Pray, says one of them, what does the old gentleman do with all those books and papers in the coach?–That’s what nobody knows, says I, unless his head’s cracked, which is Mary’s opinion.–Then they all laughed more and more, and the lady of the house said:–Pray can he really read?–Whoo! says I, why he does nothing else; he’s at it from morning till night, and Mary says she’s sure before long he’ll give up his meat and drink for it.–I’ve always heard he was a quiz, says another, or a quoz, or some such word; but I did not know he was such a book-worm.–The old quoz is generous, however, I hear, says another, pray do you find him so?–As to that, I can’t say, says I, for I never see the colour of his money.–No! then, what are you such a fool as to serve him for?–So, then, your honour, I found, owing to the coach and the arms, and the like, they thought all the time it was your honour was in the coach. I hope your honour don’t take it amiss of me?’</p> 
<p>‘Not at all Jacob; only I don’t know why. they call me an old quiz and quoz for; never having offended them; which I take rather unkind; especially not knowing what it means.’</p> 
<p>‘Why, your honour, they’re such comical sort of folks; they don’t mind what they say of nobody. Not but what the lady of the house is a rare gentlewoman. Your honour could not help liking her. I warrant she’s made many a man’s heart ache, and then jumped for joy when she’d done. And as to her eyes, I think in my born days I never see nothing like ’em: they shines like two candles on a dark night afar off on the common —.’</p> 
<p>‘Why Jacob,’ said Sir Hugh, ‘I see you have lost your heart. However, go on.’</p> 
<p>‘Why, as soon as I found out what they meant–That my master? says I, no, God be thanked! What should I have to live upon if a was? Not so much as a cobweb! for there would not be wherewithal for a spider to make it.’</p> 
<p>Here Sir Hugh, with much displeasure, interrupted him; ‘As to the poor gentleman’s being poor,’ said he, ‘it’s no fault of his own, for he’d be rich if he could, I make no doubt; never having heard he was a gambler. Besides which, I always respect a man the more for being poor, knowing how little a rich man may have in him; which I can judge by my own case.’</p> 
<p>Jacob proceeded.</p> 
<p>‘Well, if it is not Sir Hugh, says one of them, who is it?–Why, it’s only our Latin master, says I; upon which they all set up as jolly a laugh again as ever I heard in my days. Jobbins, they’re pure merry!–And who learns Latin! says one, I hope they don’t let him work at poor old Sir Hugh? No, says I, they tried their hands with him at first, but he thanked ’em for nothing. He soon grew tired on’t.–So then they said, who learns now, says they, do you?–Me! says I, no, God be praised, I don’t know A from B, which is the way my head’s so clear, never having muddled it with what I don’t understand.–And so then they all said I was a brave fellow; and they ordered me a glass of wine.’</p> 
<p>What a set! thought Edgar, is this, idle, dissipated, curious-for Camilla to associate with!-the lively, the unthinking, the inexperienced Camilla!</p> 
<p>‘So then they asked me, says they, does Miss Lynmere learn, says they?–Not, as I know of, says I, she’s no great turn for her book, as ever I heard of; which I hope Miss you won’t take ill, for they all said, no, to be sure, she’s too handsome for that.’</p> 
<p>Indiana looked uncertain whether to be flattered or offended. ‘But you have not told us what they said of Mr. Mandlebert yet?’ cried Miss Margland.</p> 
<p>‘No, I must come to you first, Miss,’ answered he, ‘for that’s what they come upon next, But mayhap I must not tell?’</p> 
<p>‘O yes, you may;’ said she, growing a little apprehensive of some affront, but determined not to seem hurt by it; ‘I am very indifferent to any thing they can say of me, assure yourself!’</p> 
<p>‘Why, I suppose, says they, this Latin master studies chiefly with the governess?–They’d study fisty-cuffs I believe, if they did, says I, for she hates him like poison; and there’s no great love lost between them.’</p> 
<p>‘And what right had you to say that, Mr. Jacob? I did not ask what you said. Not that I care, I promise you!’</p> 
<p>‘O dear no! I’m sure it’s not worth while.’</p> 
<p>‘They said worse than I did,’ resumed Jacob, ‘by a deal; they said, says they, she looks duced crabbed-she looks just as if she was always eating a sour apple, says the lady; she looks–’</p> 
<p>‘Well, well, I don’t want to hear any more of their opinions. I may look as I please I hope. I hate such gossiping.’</p> 
<p>‘So then they said, pray does Miss Camilla learn? says they;–Lord love her, no! says I.’</p> 
<p>‘And what said they to that?’ cried Edgar.</p> 
<p>‘Why, they said, they hoped not, and they were glad to hear it, for they liked her the best of all. And what does the ugly one do? says they.–’</p> 
<p>‘Come, we have heard enough now,’ interrupted Edgar, greatly shocked for poor Eugenia, who fortunately, however, had retired with Camilla.</p> 
<p>Sir Hugh too, angrily broke in upon him, saying: ‘I won’t have my niece called ugly, Jacob! You know it’s against my commands such a thing’s being mentioned.’</p> 
<p>‘Why, I told ’em so, sir,’ said Jacob; ‘ugly one, says I, she you call the ugly one, is one of the best ladies in the land. She’s ready to lend a hand to every mortal soul; she’s just like my master for that. And as to learning, I make no qu?|ry she can talk you over the Latin grammar as fast as e’er a gentleman here. So then they laughed harder than ever, and said they should be afeard to speak to her, and a deal more I can’t call to mind.–So then they come to Mr. Mandlebert. Pray, says they, what’s he doing among you all this time?–Why, nothing particular, says I, he’s only squiring about our young ladies.–But when is this wedding to be? says another. So then I said–’</p> 
<p>‘What did you say?’ cried Edgar hastily.</p> 
<p>‘Why-nothing,’ answered Jacob, drawing back.</p> 
<p>‘Tell us, however, what they said,’ cried Miss Margland.</p> 
<p>‘Why, they said, says they, everything has been ready some time at Beech Park;-and they’ll make as handsome a couple as ever was seen.’</p> 
<p>‘What stuff is this!’ cried Edgar, ‘do prithee have done.’—</p> 
<p>‘No, no,’ said Miss Margland; ‘go on, Jacob!’</p> 
<p>Indiana, conscious and glowing at the words handsome couple, could not restrain a simper; but Edgar, thinking only of Camilla, did not understand it.</p> 
<p>‘He’ll have trouble enough, says one of the gentlemen,’ continued Jacob, ‘to take care of so pretty a wife.–She’ll be worth a little trouble, says another, for I think she is the most beautifullest girl I ever see–Take my word of it, says the lady of the house, young Mandlebert is a man who won’t be made a fool of; he’ll have his own way, for all her beauty.’</p> 
<p>‘What a character to give of me to young ladies!’ cried Edgar, doubtful, in his turn, whether to be hurt or gratified.</p> 
<p>‘O she did not stop at that, sir,’ resumed Jacob, ‘for she said, I make no question, says she, but in half a year he’ll lock her up.’</p> 
<p>Indiana, surprized, gave an involuntary little shriek: but Edgar, not imputing it to any appropriate alarm, was filled with resentment against Mrs. Arlbery. What incomprehensible injustice! he said to himself: O Camilla! is it possible any event, any circumstance upon earth, could induce me to practise such an outrage? to degenerate into such a savage?</p> 
<p>‘Is this all?’ asked Miss Margland.</p> 
<p>‘No, ma’am; but I don’t know if Miss will like to hear the rest.’</p> 
<p>‘O yes,’ said Indiana, ‘if it’s about me, I don’t mind.’</p> 
<p>‘Why, they all said, Miss, you’d make the most finest bride that ever was seen, and they did not wonder at Mr. Mandlebert’s chusing you; but for all that–.’</p> 
<p>He stopt, and Edgar, who, following the bent of his own thoughts, had till now concluded Camilla to be meant, was utterly confounded by discovering his mistake. The presence of Indiana redoubled the aukwardness of the situation, and her blushes, and the increased lustre of her eyes, did not make the report seem either unwelcome, or perfectly new to her.</p> 
<p>Miss Margland raised her head triumphantly. This was precisely such a circumstance as she flattered herself would prove decisive.</p> 
<p>The Baronet, equally pleased, returned her nod of congratulation, and nodding himself towards Edgar, said; ‘you’re blown, you see! but what matters secrets about nothing? which, Lord help me, I never knew how to keep.’</p> 
<p>Edgar was now still more disconcerted, and, from mere distress what to say or do, bid Jacob go on.</p> 
<p>‘Why then, they said a deal more, how pretty she was, he continued, but they did not know how it would turn out, for the young lady was so much admired, that her husband had need look sharp after her; and if–’</p> 
<p>‘What complete impertinence!’ cried Edgar, walking about the room; ‘I really can listen no longer.’</p> 
<p>‘If he had done wisely, says the lady of the house, he would have left the professed beauty, and taken that pretty Camilla.’</p> 
<p>Edgar surprized, stopt short; this seemed to him less impertinent.</p> 
<p>‘Camilla is a charming creature, says she; though she may want a little watching too; but so does every thing that is worth having.’</p> 
<p>That woman does not want discernment, thought Edgar, nor she does not want taste.–I can never totally dislike her, if she does such justice to Camilla.</p> 
<p>He now again invited Jacob to proceed; but Indiana, with a pouting lip, walked out of the room, and Miss Margland said, there was not need to be hearing him all night.</p> 
<p>Jacob, therefore, when no more either interrupted or encouraged, soon finished his narrative. Mrs. Arlbery, amused by watching Dr. Orkborne, had insisted, for an experiment, that Jacob should not return to the coach till he was missed and called for; and so intense was the application of the Doctor to what he was composing, that this did not happen till the whole family had dined; Jacob and the coachman, at the invitation of Mrs. Arlbery, having partaken of the servants’ fare, equally pleased with the regale and the joke. Dr. Orkborne then, suddenly recollecting himself, demanded why the young ladies were so late, and was much discomposed and astonished when he heard they were gone. Mrs. Arlbery invited him into the house, and offered him refreshments, while she ordered water and a feed of corn for the horses; but he only fretted a little, and then went on again with his studies.</p> 
<p>Sir Hugh now sent some cold dinner into the Doctor’s room, and declared he should always approve his niece’s acquaintance with Mrs. Arlbery, as she was so kind to his servants and his animals.</p>
