As Rodney turned away he recognized him at once as his enterprising fellow traveler who had taken possession of the casket of jewels.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He did not care to keep up an acquaintance with him, and started to cross the street. But the other came forward smiling, and with a nod said: "I believe you are the young man I met yesterday in the cars and afterwards at Kentville?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, sir."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just wanted to tell you that I had got back my jewel box, the one for which I mistook yours."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed!" said Rodney, who did not believe a word the fellow said.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quite an amusing mistake, I made."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It might have proved serious to me."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very true, as I shouldn't have known where to find you to restore your property."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think that would have troubled you much," thought Rodney. "Where did you find your box?" he asked.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the car. That is, the conductor picked it up and left it at the depot for me. Where are you staying here in the city? At the Astor House?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I have found a boarding house on West Fourteenth Street."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is a good place, I should like to go there. What is the number?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't recall it, though I could find it," answered Rodney with reserve, for he had no wish to have his railroad acquaintance in the house.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the gentleman who was traveling with you there also?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, sir."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is a very pleasant gentleman, though he misjudged me. Ha, ha! my friends will be very much amused when I tell them that I was taken for a thief. Why, I venture to say that my box is more valuable than yours."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very likely," said Rodney coldly. "Good morning."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning. I hope we may meet again."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rodney nodded, but he could not in sincerity echo the wish.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was now confronted by a serious problem. He had less than ten dollars in his pocketbook, and this would soon be swallowed up by the necessary expenses of life in a large city. What would he do when that was gone?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was clear that he must go to work as soon as possible. If his guardian had remained in the city, probably through his influence a situation might have been secured. Now nothing was to be looked for in that quarter.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He bought a morning paper and looked over the Want Column. He found two places within a short distance of the Astor House, and called at each. One was in a railroad office.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My boy," said the manager, a pleasant looking man, "the place was taken hours since. You don't seem to get up very early in the morning."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I could get up at any hour that was necessary," replied Rodney, "but I have only just made up my mind to apply for a position."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You won't meet with any luck today. It is too late. Get up bright and early tomorrow morning, buy a paper, and make early application for any place that strikes you as desirable."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, sir. I am sure your advice is good."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you had been the first to call here, I should have taken you. I like your appearance better than that of the boy I have selected."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, sir."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This boy may not prove satisfactory. Call in six days, just before his week expires, and if there is likely to be a vacancy I will let you know."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, sir. You are very kind."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I always sympathize with boys. I have two boys of my own."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This conversation quite encouraged Rodney. It seemed to promise success in the future. If he had probably impressed one man, he might be equally fortunate with another.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was about half past twelve when he passed through Nassau Street.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All at once his arm was grasped, and a cheery voice said, "Where are you going, Rodney?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Woods!" he exclaimed, with pleased recognition.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it's your old friend Woods."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not the only railroad friend I have met this morning."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who was the other?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The gentleman who obligingly took care of my jewel box for a short time."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't mean to say you have met him? Where did you come across him?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In front of the Astor House, almost two hours since."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you speak to him?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He spoke to me. You will be glad to hear that he has recovered his own casket of jewels."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adin Woods smiled.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He must think you are easily imposed upon," he said, "to believe any such story. Anything more?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He said his friends would be very much surprised to hear that he had been suspected of theft."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So he wanted to clear himself with you?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes; he asked where I was staying."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope you didn't tell him."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I only said I was at a boarding house on West Fourteenth Street, but didn't mention the number."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He thinks you have the casket with you, and that he may get possession of it. It is well that you stored it at Tiffany's."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think so. Now I have no anxiety about it. Do you think he will find out where we live?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably, as you gave him a clew. But, Rodney, it is about lunch time, and I confess I have an appetite. Come and lunch with me."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I am afraid, Mr. Woods, I shall not be able to return the compliment."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no occasion for it. I feel in good humor this morning. I have sold one lot, and have hopes of disposing of another. The one lot pays me a commission of twenty dollars."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wish I could make twenty dollars in a week."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sometimes I only sell one lot in a week. It isn't like a regular business. It is precarious. Still, take the year through and I make a pretty good income. Come in here. We can get a good lunch here," and he led the way into a modest restaurant, not far from the site of the old post office, which will be remembered by those whose residence in New York dates back twenty years or more.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now we will have a nice lunch," said the agent. "I hope you can do justice to it."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I generally can," responded Rodney, smiling. "I am seldom troubled with a poor appetite."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ditto for me. Now what have you been doing this morning?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Looking for a place."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With what success?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pretty good if I had only been earlier."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rodney told the story of his application to the manager of the railroad office.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will know better next time. I think you'll succeed. I did. When I came to New York at the age of twenty two I had only fifty dollars. That small sum had to last me twelve weeks. You can judge that I didn't live on the fat of the land during that time. I couldn't often eat at Delmonico's. Even Beefsteak John's would have been too expensive for me. However, those old days are over."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day and the two following Rodney went about the city making application for positions, but every place seemed full.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the third day Mr. Woods said, "I shall have to leave you for a week or more, Rodney."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are you going?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To Philadelphia. There's a man there who is a capitalist and likes land investments. I am going to visit him, and hope to sell him several lots. He once lived in this city, so he won't object to New York investments."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope you will succeed, Mr. Woods. I think if you are going away I had better give up the room, and find cheaper accommodations. I am getting near the end of my money."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are right. It is best to be prudent."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That evening Rodney found a room which he could rent for two dollars a week. He estimated that by economy he could get along for fifty cents a day for his eating, and that would be a decided saving.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was just leaving the house the next morning, gripsack in hand, when on the steps he met Louis Wheeler, his acquaintance of the train.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are you going?" asked Wheeler.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am leaving this house. I have hired a room elsewhere."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wheeler's countenance fell, and he looked dismayed.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why, I have just taken a room here for a week," he said.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will find it a good place."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But -- I wouldn't have come here if I hadn't thought I should have company."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I ought to feel complimented."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rodney was convinced that Wheeler had come in the hopes of stealing the casket of jewels a second time, and he felt amused at the fellow's discomfiture.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You haven't got your jewel box with you?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I can take that another time."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then it's still in the house," thought Wheeler with satisfaction. "It won't be my fault if I don't get it in my hands. Well, good morning," he said. "Come around and call on me."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you!"</p>
