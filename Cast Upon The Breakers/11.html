<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Redwood," said the merchant "I have reason to think that one of my clerks is dishonest."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who, sir?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is what I want you to find out."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What reason have you for suspecting any one?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Some ladies' cloaks and some dress patterns are missing."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure they were not sold?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes: the record of sales has been examined, and they are not included."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is strange, Mr. Goodnow" said Redwood thoughtfully. "I hope I am not under suspicion."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, not at all."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The losses seem to have taken place in my department."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "True, but that doesn't involve you."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want me to do?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Watch those under you. Let nothing in your manner, however, suggest that you are suspicious. I don't want you to put any one on his guard."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All right, sir. I will be guided by your instructions. Have you any idea how long this has been going on?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only a few weeks."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Redwood turned to go back to his room, but Mr. Goodnow called him back.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I needn't suggest to you," he said, "that you keep this to yourself. Don't let any clerk into the secret."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very well, sir."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James Redwood, however, did not keep his promise. After supper he called back Jasper as he was about putting on his hat to go out, and said, "Jasper, I wish to speak with you for five minutes."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Won't it do tomorrow morning? I have an engagement."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Put it off, then. This is a matter of importance."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very well, sir," and Jasper, albeit reluctantly, laid down his hat and sat down.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jasper," said his uncle, "there's a thief in our establishment."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jasper started, and his sallow complexion turned yellower than usual.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean, uncle?" he asked nervously.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What I say. Some articles are missing that have not been sold."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Such as what?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ladies' cloaks and dress patterns."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who told you?" asked Jasper in a low tone.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Goodnow."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the boss?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How should he know?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't inquire, and if I had he probably wouldn't have told me. The main thing is that he does know."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He may not be sure."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is not a man to speak unless he feels pretty sure."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't see how any one could steal the articles without being detected."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems they are detected."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did -- did Mr. Goodnow mention any names?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. He wants to watch and find out the thief. I wish you to help me, though I am acting against instructions. Mr. Goodnow asked me to take no one into my confidence. You will see, therefore, that it will be necessary for you to say nothing."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I won't breathe a word," said Jasper, who seemed to feel more at ease.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now that I have told you so much, can you suggest any person who would be likely to commit the theft?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jasper remained silent for a moment, then with a smile of malicious satisfaction said, "Yes, I can suggest a person."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is it?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The new boy, Rodney Ropes."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James Redwood shook his head.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't believe that it is he. I am not in love with the young fellow, who seems to stand in the way of your advancement but he seems straight enough, and I don't think it at all likely that he should be the guilty person."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Uncle James, he seems straight but you know that still waters run deep."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you seen anything that would indicate guilt on his part?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have noticed this, that, he is very well dressed for a boy of his small salary, and seems always to have money to spend."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That will count for something. Still he might have some outide means. Have you noticed anything else?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jasper hesitated.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I noticed one evening when he left the store that he had a sizable parcel under his arm."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And you think it might have contained some article stolen from the stock?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's just what I think now. Nothing of the kind occurred to me at that time, for I didn't know any articles were missing."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That seems important. When was it that you noticed this?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One day last week," answered Jasper hesitatingly.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you remember the day?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Couldn't you fix it some way?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. You see, I didn't attach any particular importance to it at the time, and probably it would not have occurred to me again, but for your mentioning that articles were missing."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There may be something in what you say," said his uncle thoughtfully. "I will take special notice of young Ropes after this."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So will I."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't let him observe that he is watched. It would defeat our chances of detecting the thief."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'll be careful. Do you want to say anything more, uncle?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. By the way, where were you going this evening?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was going to meet a friend, and perhaps go to the theater. You couldn't lend me a dollar, could you, Uncle James?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I could, but you are not quite able to pay for your own pleasures. It costs all my salary to live, and its going to be worse next year, for I shall have to pay a higher rent."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I have my pay raised, I can get along better."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Ropes loses his place, you will probably step into it."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I hope he'll go, and that soon."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Jasper passed through the front door and stood on the sidewalk, he breathed a sigh of relief.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, they are on to us," he said to himself. "But how was it found out? That's what I'd like to know. I have been very careful. I must see Carton at once."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A short walk took him to a billiard room not far from Broadway. A young man of twenty five, with a slight mustache, and a thin, dark face, was selecting a cue.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, Jasper!" he said. "Come at last. Let us have a game of pool."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not just yet. Come outide. I want to speak to you."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jasper looked serious, and Philip Carton, observing it, made no remonstrance, but taking his hat, followed him out.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, what is it?" he asked.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Something serious. It is discovered at the store that goods are missing."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't mean it? Are we suspected?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No one is suspected -- yet."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But how do you know?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My uncle spoke to me about it this evening -- just after supper."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He doesn't think you are in it."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did he find out?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Through the boss. Goodnow spoke to him about it today."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But how should Goodnow know anything about it?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That no one can tell but himself. He asked Uncle James to watch the clerks, and see if he could fasten the theft on any of them."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is pleasant for us. It is well we are informed so that we can be on our guard. I am afraid our game is up."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the present at any rate we must suspend operations. Now, have you some money for me?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, a little."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A little? Why there are two cloaks and a silk dress pattern to be accounted for."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "True, but I have to be very careful. I have to submit to a big discount for the parties I sell to undoubtedly suspect that the articles are stolen."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wouldn't it be better to pawn them?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It would be more dangerous. Besides you know how liberal pawnbrokers are. I'll tell you what would be better. If I had a sufficient number of articles to warrant it, I could take them on to Boston or Philadelphia, and there would be less risk selling them there."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is true. I wish we had thought of that before. Now we shall have to give up the business for a time. How much money have you got for me?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Seven dollars."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Seven dollars!" exclaimed Jasper in disgust. "Why, that is ridiculous. The articles must have been worth at retail a hundred dollars."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps so, but I only got fourteen for them. If you think you can do any better you may sell them yourself next time."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought I should assuredly get fifteen dollars out of it," said Jasper, looking deeply disappointed. "I had a use for the money too."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very likely. So had I."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I suppose I must make it do. Listen and I will tell you how I think I can turn this thing to my advantage."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go ahead!"</p>
