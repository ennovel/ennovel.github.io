BARNEY’S DISAPPEARANCE—FIGHT WITH BEARS.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      As far as the eye could reach all was one vast snow bank. The wind rioting had twisted the loose material into all sorts of fantastic shapes.
<br> 
<br> The snow had now ceased falling and the air was crisp and clear.
<br> 
<br> Leaving the airship’s deck the voyagers walked boldly out upon the huge drifts.
<br> 
<br> The snowshoes prevented their sinking into the white depths, perhaps over their heads.
<br> 
<br> Frank Reade, Jr., led the way to the highest point accessible and from this a good view of the surroundings could be had.
<br> 
<br> It was a bleak, desolate and forbidding region spread to view.
<br> 
<br> Yet the white country had its peculiar beauty and charms. Like crystal palaces the bergs of clearest ice glistened in the rarefied air.
<br> 
<br> “Grand!” cried Professor Gaston. “Where will you ever see the likes again?”
<br> 
<br> “Begorra, I wish I had a toboggan!” cried Barney, pointing to an icy slope near.
<br> 
<br> “Yo’ don’ need nuffin’ ob dat kind, sah!” cried Pomp. “Jes’ slide down on yo’ feet an’ stiddy yo’se’f wif a pike.”
<br> 
<br> All the party had long pike poles with iron tips to prevent sliding into any hole or dangerous pit.
<br> 
<br> Barney was just in a mood to refute any dare that Pomp might offer, so he cried:
<br> 
<br> “Bejabers, I’ll go ye!”
<br> 
<br> “A’right, I’ish!”
<br> 
<br> Away went the two jokers at full speed across the snow. They reached the slope a few moments later.
<br> 
<br> The slide was fully a hundred yards in length, and was quite steep and slippery. Frank looked anxious.
<br> 
<br> “I fear they are rash,” he said. “If one of them should fall he might break some bones.”
<br> 
<br> But Professor Gaston laughed.
<br> 
<br> “Have no fear,” he said. “They will make it all safely. It is fun for them.”
<br> 
<br> The two jokers were now on the brow of the descent. They were chaffing each other in a friendly manner.
<br> 
<br> “Am yo’ ready, I’ish?” cried Pomp.
<br> 
<br> “Begorra, I am!”
<br> 
<br> “Then jes’ follow me!”
<br> 
<br> With their pikes thrust deep into the ice behind, and acting both as rudder and support, they began the slide.
<br> 
<br> The surface seemed as smooth as polished glass. Down they shot at lightning speed.
<br> 
<br> It required but a few brief seconds to cover the distance.
<br> 
<br> But before it was covered a thrilling incident occurred. Suddenly, and when half way down, there was a crackling sound, and Barney threw up his arms and disappeared.
<br> 
<br> Pomp went on down to the end of the slide.
<br> 
<br> A cry of horror burst simultaneously from the lips of Frank Reade, Jr., and Professor Gaston.
<br> 
<br> “My soul!” cried the young inventor. “My fears are realized! Barney is lost!”
<br> 
<br> They lost no time, but started at once for the spot.
<br> 
<br> Reaching the foot of the slide, Frank saw the explanation of Barney’s disappearance.
<br> 
<br> There, in the surface of the slide, was a yawning hole. The ice in this spot was thin and had covered a pit, into which the unlucky Celt had fallen.
<br> 
<br> With the aid of his pike, Frank crawled to the edge of the hole and looked in.
<br> 
<br> What he beheld gave him an awful, horrified chill.
<br> 
<br> “My God!” he cried, wildly, “Barney has gone to his death!”
<br> 
<br> “Don’t say that!” cried Gaston. “Can we not pull him out of that awful hole?”
<br> 
<br> “No,” replied Frank, sadly. “Barney is beyond earthly aid!”
<br> 
<br> By this time Pomp and Gaston were by Frank’s side. A glance into the hole was enough.
<br> 
<br> It was a deep, circular opening, extending downward for twenty feet. At its bottom was a surging, boiling mass of icy waters.
<br> 
<br> It was into the ocean that Barney had dropped.
<br> 
<br> Doubtless before this he had been carried under the vast field of ice and was beyond earthly aid.
<br> 
<br> For a moment the three explorers looked at each other in utter horror.
<br> 
<br> Then Pomp began to wail in sorrow.
<br> 
<br> “Fo’ de good Lor’, am de I’ishman done gone an’ dronwed?” he cried. “Den dis chile am lef’ all alone. Boo, hoo, hoo! He was jes’ de bes’ frien’ I eber had. Wha’ am I gwine to do now?”
<br> 
<br> Indeed, all were deeply affected. Pomp was inconsolable.
<br> 
<br> Watch was kept at the hole for a reasonable time in the faint hope that the Celt would reappear.
<br> 
<br> But he did not.
<br> 
<br> Sorrowfully the three explorers now returned to the airship. But before they reached it they were confronted with new and startling incidents.
<br> 
<br> The Dart was half buried in the snow at the foot of the big berg. As Frank and his companions came in sight of the Dart they paused.
<br> 
<br> Clambering over the deck were a number of fur-clad forms.
<br> 
<br> At first the explorers thought them human beings, but a closer glance showed that they were huge white bears.
<br> 
<br> Six of the monsters were boarding the airship in the coolest possible manner.
<br> 
<br> “Great heavens!” exclaimed Professor Gaston. “What does that mean, Frank?”
<br> 
<br> “It looks as if the bears had taken possession of our property,” declared the young inventor.
<br> 
<br> “Can they do any harm?”
<br> 
<br> “Certainly. We must tackle them at once.”
<br> 
<br> The prospect of tackling the six monsters was by no means a pleasant one.
<br> 
<br> The white bear is known as a powerful and savage beast and not easily handled.
<br> 
<br> But there was no alternative for the adventurers.
<br> 
<br> They must certainly regain the airship. It was not easy to say how long the bears would remain on board or what damage they might do.
<br> 
<br> “Forward!” cried Frank. “Reserve your fire until at close quarters.”
<br> 
<br> This command was obeyed.
<br> 
<br> When near the rail fire was opened with the Winchesters. One of the bears tumbled in a heap with three bullets in his carcass.
<br> 
<br> Frank’s plan was to tackle one bear at a time and fire at him until he succumbed. This would have been all very well had the bears remained inactive.
<br> 
<br> But this they did not seem disposed to do. At sight of the white men they came to the attack at once.
<br> 
<br> The white bear is a huge, unwieldy monster, but nevertheless supple and quick in action.
<br> 
<br> The five remaining bears started for the explorers pell mell. They were evidently hungry and regarded them as lawful prey.
<br> 
<br> “Look out!” shouted Frank. “Separate and fire as rapidly as you can.”
<br> 
<br> These instructions were followed.
<br> 
<br> Pomp retreated as fast as his legs could carry him with two of the bears after him. On even ground the darky might have distanced them.
<br> 
<br> But on the snowshoes he found it hot work to keep out of reach of their paws. Once overtaken, his fate would be sealed.
<br> 
<br> Knowing this, he sped on with all speed. There was no chance to turn and fire until he had gained at least a reasonable distance.
<br> 
<br> The darky was all pluck, however, and kept on at a rapid pace. Finally he managed to gain a pinnacle of ice which projected upward from the plain.
<br> 
<br> This he believed was his opportunity.
<br> 
<br> Quick as a flash he dodged behind it. Then he drew aim at almost point-blank range and fired at the first bear.
<br> 
<br> The bullet took effect in the brute’s brain, through the eye. It staggered back and then dropped in a heap.
<br> 
<br> A yell of pleasure escaped the darky’s lips. He was about to draw back the hammer and throw a second cartridge into the rifle barrel when he saw, with horror, that there was not another cartridge in the chamber of the repeater.
<br> 
<br> He had just time to dodge the surviving bear around the ice pinnacle.
<br> 
<br> Round and round he went, the bear at his heels. The predicament was a comical as well as a serious one.
<br> 
<br> “Golly! wha’ am I gwine to do?” reflected the darky. “I kain’t keep dis sort of fing up fo’ebber.”
<br> 
<br> The bear was enraged at his futile effort to capture his prey. Pomp eluded him every time.
<br> 
<br> Then a daring idea occurred to the darky. He broke away and made a dash for the airship.
<br> 
<br> If he could reach it and gain an entrance to the cabin he would be saved. Unarmed as he was it was certain death to face the bear.
<br> 
<br> Swift as he could, Pomp ran toward the Dart. The bear was howling close at his heels.
<br> 
<br> Indeed, when the Dart’s rail was reached the monster was hardly three yards behind. A dozen yards more and Pomp would certainly have been captured.
<br> 
<br> Over the rail at a leap went the darky. The next moment he reached the cabin door.
<br> 
<br> He threw his weight against it and it gave way. Into the cabin he sprang. The bear paused at the door.
<br> 
<br> While the brute seemed to be meditating upon the feasibility of entering, Pomp procured an elephant rifle.
<br> 
<br> This threw a deadly explosive shell of Frank Reade, Jr.’s own invention. Pomp took steady aim at the brute.
<br> 
<br> Then he fired.
<br> 
<br> The shell struck the bear in the chest. It was instantly fatal, penetrating the heart. Pomp had won.
<br> 
<br> Then the victorious darky thought of his companions.
<br> 
<br> “Golly! I done fink Marse Frank am habin’ a hard time!” he cried.
<br> 
<br> This was indeed true.
<br> 
<br> Professor Gaston was dodging his bear behind an ice column as Pomp had been. But Frank was in hand-to-hand conflict with the remaining two bears.
<br> 
<br> The young inventor had fired three bullets into the body of one of the bears. But though somewhat crippled, the beast was yet in fighting trim.
<br> 
<br> And both had come to close quarters with Frank.
<br> 
<br> He had drawn his long hunting-knife and was slashing at the brutes, but it was a moral certainty that he would have been soon overpowered had it not been for the opportune coming of Pomp.
<br> 
<br> The darky rushed up at this moment and cried:
<br> 
<br> “Jes’ yo’ hol’ on, Marse Frank. I’se here, an’ I’se gwine to sabe yo’.”
<br> 
<br> Placing his elephant rifle close against the body of one of the bears Pomp pulled the trigger. The effect was fatal.
<br> 
<br> The brute’s vitals were literally destroyed, and it sank dying upon the snow. The other bear Frank quickly finished with his knife.
<br> 
<br> Then the two victorious hunters went to the rescue of Professor Gaston.
<br> 
<br> This sole remaining bear was easily dispatched and the battle was over.
<br> 
<br> Beyond a few scratches and cuts the party was uninjured. But all realized what good reason there was for self-congratulation.
<br> 
<br> “By Jove!” cried Frank. “Six bears to three men! That is the biggest luck for one day’s hunting that I have ever seen.”
<br> 
<br> “If we had been hunting for such game we could never have found it in such numbers,” declared Professor Gaston.
<br> 
<br> “I don’t know about dat!” said Pomp, dubiously. “Dar am a heap ob dem critters in dese regions!”
<br> 
<br> “Well,” cried Frank, cheerily, “let us remove their pelts and keep them as trophies of our prowess, anyhow.”
