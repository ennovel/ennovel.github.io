THE AIRSHIP TO THE RESCUE.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      “Dead!” he exclaimed, in hollow tones. “It is Martin Jones, foretopman. He has been murdered!”
<br> 
<br> Captain Hardy reeled toward the cabin door. His face was chalky white.
<br> 
<br> “Lucille!” he gasped.
<br> 
<br> The same thought was in Jack Wallis’ mind. He followed at once.
<br> 
<br> The companionway was stained with blood, the cabin floor the same. On went the two hunters.
<br> 
<br> There by the galley fire, which was out, lay the stark and stiff forms of three more of the crew.
<br> 
<br> They were in positions to show that they had fought for their lives.
<br> 
<br> But where were the other two and Lucille?
<br> 
<br> “Mark Vane and Alvan Bates, with Lucille, are missing!” declared the excited captain. “What can have become of them?”
<br> 
<br> “There is but one theory.”
<br> 
<br> “What?”
<br> 
<br> “They have been taken away as prisoners.”
<br> 
<br> “As prisoners?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes.”
<br> 
<br> “But by whom?”
<br> 
<br> “As yet I cannot answer. Human fiends, no doubt. See, the ship has been ransacked and many things carried away.”
<br> 
<br> “You are right.”
<br> 
<br> “I have an idea.”
<br> 
<br> “What is it?”
<br> 
<br> “Below us lies the great continent?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes.”
<br> 
<br> “I fancy it is inhabited by various tribes of savages who are hostile. They have come out on to the pack, hunting, and have found the ship.”
<br> 
<br> “My God! and they have taken Lucille away, captive?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes.”
<br> 
<br> For a moment tears of agony streamed down Captain Hardy’s face.
<br> 
<br> Then he grasped Jack’s hand.
<br> 
<br> “My boy,” he said, in agony, “it is a fearful blow! Life is sped for me now. The Albatross will never see home again!”
<br> 
<br> “Don’t give up.”
<br> 
<br> “But how can it? How can we ever go back and leave Lucille here?”
<br> 
<br> “We will not!”
<br> 
<br> Jack Wallis’ voice rang out with clarion pitch.
<br> 
<br> “I tell you we will rescue Lucille if we have to follow those wretches to the very heart of the Antarctic continent itself!”
<br> 
<br> “Brave boy!” cried Captain Hardy. “But will the ship be here? Can we find our way back?”
<br> 
<br> “We have our bearings. But I hope that we may overtake the wretches before they have gone very far.”
<br> 
<br> “Then let us be off!”
<br> 
<br> “At once!”
<br> 
<br> “We will return and bury these poor fellows later.”
<br> 
<br> “Yes; all depends upon prompt pursuit.”
<br> 
<br> Leaving the ship, the two desperate men set out upon the trail. It was a broad and easy one to follow.
<br> 
<br> The air had moderated very much. Indeed, there was a faint mist creeping up from the sea.
<br> 
<br> The barbarians left huge footprints in the snow, and it was from these that Captain Hardy drew his deductions.
<br> 
<br> “I tell you they are literal giants!” he declared. “No doubt they are fearful fighters.”
<br> 
<br> “Yet they cannot, one of them, stop a rifle ball without getting sick,” said Jack.
<br> 
<br> “You are right, there!”
<br> 
<br> On through the snow for hours the two men followed the tracks.
<br> 
<br> All that day and the next they followed it. Happily they had taken the precaution to bring eatables.
<br> 
<br> A few hours’ sleep in the snow was all the rest they got, but they were consoled with the cheerful fact that every moment the trail grew fresher.
<br> 
<br> And now, from the horizon line, there had arisen vast heights of snowy white. Towering yet above them all was a mighty peak, which sent forth flame and smoke.
<br> 
<br> “A volcano!” declared Captain Hardy. “I’ll wager we will find the settlement of the barbarians not far from that.”
<br> 
<br> “I think you may be very sure of it,” declared Jack Wallis.
<br> 
<br> But as they drew nearer the coast line suddenly some startling incidents occurred.
<br> 
<br> Jack, who was in advance, suddenly halted.
<br> 
<br> A cry of alarm pealed from his lips.
<br> 
<br> At that moment they had been approaching a vast pile of conglomerated ice. Suddenly, from behind it, a number of strange-looking beings sprang forth.
<br> 
<br> They were gigantic in stature and dressed in skins, with the tusks of the seal for horns upon their head-dresses, which consisted of untanned seal hide, with holes for the eyes and mouth.
<br> 
<br> They were armed with huge battle clubs, with the bones of huge fish and huge rocks for heads, and javelins tipped with stone or fish bones.
<br> 
<br> At sight of the two men they came forward with a rush.
<br> 
<br> Brandishing their weapons and yelling, they rushed forward.
<br> 
<br> It was a critical moment.
<br> 
<br> It was a question of life or death, and there seemed but one move for the two men to make.
<br> 
<br> “Aim low!” cautioned Captain Hardy. “Take the first man!”
<br> 
<br> Then their rifles spoke.
<br> 
<br> Two of the barbarians fell.
<br> 
<br> Fortunately our adventurers had good repeating Winchesters, and they were enabled to keep up a good steady fire.
<br> 
<br> But the barbarians now began hurling their javelins. One nearly impaled Jack. This caused him to shout:
<br> 
<br> “This way, Captain Hardy! We must get shelter!”
<br> 
<br> Both retreated to the cover of some blocks of ice and the battle went on.
<br> 
<br> They pluckily held the foe at bay. But the barbarians seemed to become legion in number.
<br> 
<br> It seemed as if a hundred of them at least had appeared upon the scene from some mysterious source.
<br> 
<br> And now our adventurers made an appalling discovery.
<br> 
<br> This was that they had neglected to take sufficient ammunition from the ship with them. But a few more rounds of cartridges were left.
<br> 
<br> With blanched faces they looked at each other.
<br> 
<br> “My boy,” said Captain Hardy, steadily, “I fear it is all up with us!”
<br> 
<br> “It looks so, captain.”
<br> 
<br> “What an awful fate!”
<br> 
<br> “At least we will die game!”
<br> 
<br> Wallis shut his lips tightly and resumed the firing. He made every shot tell. But presently he found that he had but three cartridges left.
<br> 
<br> And the barbarians were every moment growing bolder. A hand-to-hand combat would be sure to be fatal.
<br> 
<br> A few moments more and they would certainly have overwhelmed the two brave men, had it not been for an intervention.
<br> 
<br> And this came from a most unexpected quarter.
<br> 
<br> Suddenly, what seemed like a veritable bolt of lightning dropped from the sky, and right among the barbarians.
<br> 
<br> There was a fearful explosion.
<br> 
<br> Tons of ice and snow rose to the height of fifty feet in the air. Dozens of the barbarians were torn in shreds.
<br> 
<br> Astounded, Jack and Captain Hardy looked up and beheld a sight the like of which they had never seen before.
<br> 
<br> “Great Neptune!” gasped the captain. “A ship sailing in the air!”
<br> 
<br> This was what it seemed.
<br> 
<br> But in place of sails were flapping wings. The hull was of different shape. It was a ship, but not one intended for sailing the seas.
<br> 
<br> That it was not a supernatural apparition was evident, for at the rail were four men, all of them shouting encouraging words.
<br> 
<br> “Keep up, friends!” came down from above. “We will help you!”
<br> 
<br> “Ahoy!” gasped Captain Hardy, in amazement. “Who are you?”
<br> 
<br> “This is Frank Reade, Jr.’s airship, the Dart. We are Americans!”
<br> 
<br> “And so are we,” replied Hardy. “I’ve commanded many a good ship in my life, but I never yet saw one that sailed in the air.”
<br> 
<br> At this the aerial voyagers laughed.
<br> 
<br> “Wait and we will descend!” they cried.
<br> 
<br> Then the Dart settled rapidly until it alighted upon the ice. At the rail four men were standing.
<br> 
<br> One was a tall, handsome young man, another was short and wore glasses, one was an Irishman, and the fourth was a negro, as black as coal.
<br> 
<br> The reader, of course, recognizes them as Frank Reade, Jr., Barney and Pomp, and the scientist, Professor Gaston.
<br> 
<br> They had left home some six weeks previous and had enjoyed a first-class trip of eight thousand miles or more.
<br> 
<br> One thing was certain. They had arrived in the nick of time to save the lives of Captain Hardy and Jack.
<br> 
<br> Stories were soon exchanged. Frank Reade, Jr., listened with deep interest to the story of the whalers.
<br> 
<br> When he was told about Lucille’s capture by the Antarctic natives he was at once aroused, and cried:
<br> 
<br> “She shall be rescued, and have no fear, Captain Hardy!”
<br> 
<br> “God bless you, sir!” cried the overjoyed captain. “Of course, you have it in your power to do so with your airship?”
<br> 
<br> “I believe so. At least we will try.”
<br> 
<br> “Antarctic natives!” cried Professor Gaston, at once interested. “Well, that settles one important point, don’t it, that the South Pole regions are inhabited?”
<br> 
<br> “It does!” agreed Frank. “And yonder are mountains and a volcano!”
<br> 
<br> The scientist was, however, just now interested in the barbarians.
<br> 
<br> A visit was made to the spot where the electric bomb had exploded.
<br> 
<br> Some of the primitive weapons of the barbarians were secured. Several of them had escaped mutilation and a look was taken at their features.
<br> 
<br> “Of the Aryan type!” declared Professor Gaston. “Barbarians in every sense of the word. The shape of the skull precludes anything but low intellect.”
<br> 
<br> The remaining or surviving barbarians had vanished.
<br> 
<br> Where they had gone was something of a mystery. Certain it was they were not in sight anywhere.
<br> 
<br> It was decided to follow their trail as well as possible through the snow.
<br> 
<br> This was not difficult.
<br> 
<br> It was well-defined and broad.
<br> 
<br> For some ways the airship kept on.
<br> 
<br> Then the volcano and its attendant peaks drew nearer.
<br> 
<br> To the surprise of all it was seen that the slope of the volcanic mountain were devoid of snow.
<br> 
<br> What was more, there actually seemed to be vegetation upon it.
<br> 
<br> But this was probably in the form of Arctic mosses and ferns, which grow in very barren places and even under the snow.
<br> 
<br> But as the airship now rapidly drew nearer to the volcano a startling discovery was made.
<br> 
<br> “Look!” cried Jack Wallis, in amazement. “The mountain is hollow!”
<br> 
<br> Indeed, the appearance of a mighty yawning cavity in its side seemed to warrant this assertion.
<br> 
<br> The volcano looked like a walnut shell cut in halves, with its side cut open.
