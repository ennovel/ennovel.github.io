THE ALBATROSS RELEASED.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      Frank Reade, Jr., saw at once how useless it was to attempt to treat with the ignorant horde.
<br> 
<br> It was folly to think of such a thing. Murder was in their hearts and the only way to wipe it out was to give them battle.
<br> 
<br> So the young inventor cried:
<br> 
<br> “Look out, friends! Stand by and don’t let them get to close quarters!”
<br> 
<br> The barbarians hurled their javelins with vengeful aim.
<br> 
<br> Some of them went true to the mark. But the points being only of flint or fish bone were easily turned against the armor of the white men.
<br> 
<br> So that the white men in this respect held a great advantage.
<br> 
<br> They fired almost point blank with their Winchesters. Several of the natives dropped dead.
<br> 
<br> But this did not deter them. Charging with such blind fury the battle could not help but be brought to close quarters.
<br> 
<br> And here it seemed for a moment as if the barbarians would win.
<br> 
<br> With their heavy battle clubs, which they swung above their heads with fearful force, they dealt terrible blows.
<br> 
<br> The armor resisted the point of the axe, but the concussion was something likely to prove almost as fatal. The guns of the white men were but frail guards.
<br> 
<br> The only way to do was to keep up a running fire and retreat before the terrible blows. This scattered the fighters, and at the same time made the outlook bad for the white men.
<br> 
<br> Indeed, for a time it began to look serious enough for them.
<br> 
<br> But at this moment Frank Reade, Jr., chanced to glance upward.
<br> 
<br> He saw that the airship had drifted over the peaks and was now above the valley. Even as he looked he saw Pomp, at the rail.
<br> 
<br> Instantly Frank signaled to him.
<br> 
<br> The astute darky was not long in grasping the situation. Professor Gaston was now on board with him, having been picked up by Pomp.
<br> 
<br> “Golly!” gasped the darky, “I done fink dat Marse Frank am in a bad scrape. Jes’ yo’ hol’ on dar, Marse Gaston. I’se gwine to fix dem chaps pretty quick!”
<br> 
<br> “Mercy on us!” cried the professor, “our men are in great danger.”
<br> 
<br> “Dat dey are, sir!”
<br> 
<br> Pomp rushed into the cabin and brought out a dynamite bomb, an invention of Frank Reade, Jr.’s. This he dropped right in the midst of the barbarians.
<br> 
<br> Instantly there was a terrific explosion. Fully a dozen of the wretches were blown into eternity.
<br> 
<br> Then the airship began to descend.
<br> 
<br> The barbarians seemed to have acquired a fearful terror of the airship. At sight of it now they beat an inglorious retreat.
<br> 
<br> Up the valley they rushed, in headlong haste. The Dart descended until within one hundred feet of the ground.
<br> 
<br> “All right, Pomp!” cried Frank, “hold right where you are. We are going to invade that big, stone building. Be ready to give us help!”
<br> 
<br> “A’right, Marse Frank!” replied Pomp, readily.
<br> 
<br> The victorious explorers now charged the barbarians’ settlement. They deserted their houses and fled incontinently.
<br> 
<br> Reaching the massive stone structure they dashed through a high arched doorway and found themselves in a long passage.
<br> 
<br> This proved to be a perfect labyrinth, but finally the rescuers came out in a high walled room in the centre of the structure.
<br> 
<br> And here, sitting upon the stone floor and bound hand and foot, were the three prisoners.
<br> 
<br> Lucille was pale but brave, and at sight of the rescuers gave a great cry of joy.
<br> 
<br> The next moment her bonds were cut and she was in her father’s arms, unharmed.
<br> 
<br> It was a joyful reunion, and among the happy ones was Jack Wallis.
<br> 
<br> The looks given each other by the young lovers were of the warmest description.
<br> 
<br> The airship had descended now, and Professor Gaston was exploring the huts of the barbarians.
<br> 
<br> “A strange race!” he declared. “Unlike any other on the face of the earth.”
<br> 
<br> He collected much valuable data and many specimens. Then all returned to the deck of the airship.
<br> 
<br> The gratitude of the Albatross’ people to Frank Reade, Jr., was of the most intense description.
<br> 
<br> “We can never forget your kindness!” they declared. “But for your aid we would never have effected the rescue, and we should all have met death.”
<br> 
<br> “But what are your plans now?” asked Frank, with interest.
<br> 
<br> “We must return to the Albatross.”
<br> 
<br> “And then——”
<br> 
<br> “Winter here and with the first thaw in the spring sail for home.”
<br> 
<br> “But you have no crew!”
<br> 
<br> “That is true,” replied Captain Hardy. “We shall be short handed. Yet if none of us die in the meanwhile the four of us could sail the ship home.”
<br> 
<br> “Yet it will be a terrible experience for you to pass the winter upon the scene of that fearful massacre,” said Frank. “Don’t you think the ice pack could be broken up?”
<br> 
<br> “Ah!” cried Captain Hardy, eagerly. “If we could have made headway against the wind for only two miles more we should have been in the open sea!”
<br> 
<br> “So I thought,” said Frank. “You are right in the edge of the pack. It should not be difficult to get a channel through.”
<br> 
<br> But Captain Hardy shook his head.
<br> 
<br> “Too much ice!”
<br> 
<br> “If you could reach the open sea you could get north, couldn’t you?”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, yes! the current has already set northward,” replied the captain.
<br> 
<br> “Then have courage,” cried Frank, “for I will pull you out of the hole!”
<br> 
<br> The captain was amazed.
<br> 
<br> “You?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes.”
<br> 
<br> “But—how?”
<br> 
<br> “Wait and you shall see.”
<br> 
<br> The airship took its flight from the volcanic valley, leaving the terrified barbarians to themselves.
<br> 
<br> As straight as the birds could fly the Dart returned to the spot, where the Albatross was nipped in the ice.
<br> 
<br> Then a descent was made.
<br> 
<br> The first move was to reverently bury the victims of the massacre and restore things to order aboard the ship.
<br> 
<br> Then Frank took a quick and comprehensive survey of the ice pack.
<br> 
<br> He saw that the Albatross lay between two ridges of block ice. It would take a century to dig a channel through with pick and shovel.
<br> 
<br> But this was not what Frank proposed to do.
<br> 
<br> He carefully obtained the lay of the ice pack. Then Barney and Pomp began drilling holes four feet deep in the ice.
<br> 
<br> A line of these holes were drilled at intervals of ten feet, the whole distance of two miles to the open sea.
<br> 
<br> Then dynamite bombs were placed in them and connected with a wire aboard the airship.
<br> 
<br> Frank pressed the electric key, and a terrific explosion followed. Tons of ice rose in the air and was hurled aside.
<br> 
<br> A literal channel was made the entire distance of two miles to the open sea. It now only remained to clear this of ice.
<br> 
<br> The crew of the Albatross cheered with delight at the prospect. The ship lay in the channel freed of ice.
<br> 
<br> But now to the gratification of every one the ice began to move out of the channel of its own accord.
<br> 
<br> The reason for this was that the Antarctic current had set to the northward and was carrying it along.
<br> 
<br> In a very few hours the channel was wholly clear.
<br> 
<br> It now only remained to get the ship out of it and into the open sea.
<br> 
<br> As there was not seaway in the channel, sail could not be made. But Frank solved the problem.
<br> 
<br> A line was carried from the ship’s bow a mile ahead and the airship was lowered and anchored firmly. Then the electric engines were set to work and one of the propellers was utilized as a drum to wind the line up on.
<br> 
<br> The engines of the airship, though delicate, were powerful, and in a very short time the ship had been towed to the end of the channel.
<br> 
<br> Here sail was made and the Albatross stood away to the northward.
<br> 
<br> Captain Hardy, Jack Wallis and Lucille stood upon the quarter deck and waved a farewell to the aerial voyagers.
<br> 
<br> “I am so glad that we were enabled to render them such a service,” said Frank. “It well repays me for my Antarctic trip.”
<br> 
<br> “Certainly. You have done a good deed,” declared Professor Gaston, warmly.
<br> 
<br> “Now for the South Pole!”
<br> 
<br> “Hurrah!”
<br> 
<br> Barney and Pomp set about their duties with a vim.
<br> 
<br> They were bosom friends and yet each was engaged in constant nagging at the other. Many were the practical jokes they played upon each other.
<br> 
<br> “Hi, dar, yo’ big I’ishman!” cried Pomp, in an imperious way, “why don’ yo’ shine up dat brasswo’k in de engine-room?”
<br> 
<br> “Begorra, an’ phwy don’t yez make us some bread we kin ate?” retorted Barney, facetiously. “Shure, the last I got hold of was that hard that I cudn’t break it wid a sledgehammer.”
<br> 
<br> “Huh! I done fink yo’ am pooty sassy, I’ish. Jes’ s’pose yo’ makes yo’ own bread fo’ awhile.”
<br> 
<br> “Bejabers, I’ll do it!”
<br> 
<br> “Yo’ will?”
<br> 
<br> “Yis, to be shure!”
<br> 
<br> “How am yo’ gwine to do it?”
<br> 
<br> “I’ll show yez!”
<br> 
<br> But Pomp blocked the galley door.
<br> 
<br> “No, yo’ don’ do anyfing ob de kin’! I done reckon I know wha’ yo’ want in here. Yo’ jest mix my fings all up an’ den Marse Frank gib me a jawing.”
<br> 
<br> “But yez wanted me to make me own bread. Now, gimme a chance.”!
<br> 
<br> “I’ll gib yo’ a chaince to see stars, honey, if yo’ don’t go on about yo’ own biz!”
<br> 
<br> This excited Barney’s ire.
<br> 
<br> The mere allusion to a fight was enough for him. He was more than ready and willing.
<br> 
<br> In an instant he bristled up.
<br> 
<br> “Oh, it’s fight yez want!” he cried, spitting on his hands. “Shure, I’m jist the lad that kin accomodate yez. Whurroo!”
<br> 
<br> “Look yer, I’ish,” said Pomp, solemnly, “does yo’ see de color ob my eye?”
<br> 
<br> “Begorra, it’ll be blacker than it is now afore I get through wid it!” spluttered Barney.
<br> 
<br> “Does yo’ mean to hit me, chile?”
<br> 
<br> “If yez don’t apologize!”
<br> 
<br> “Wha’ fo’?”
<br> 
<br> “Fer insultin’ me, bejabers!”
<br> 
<br> “Gwan away. I neber ’sulted yo’.”
<br> 
<br> “Bejabers, that’s a loie! Here’s wan fer luck!”
<br> 
<br> With this Barney made a swoop at the darky. Pomp easily dodged it, however, and retreated a step.
<br> 
<br> Barney came at him again, hammer and tongs. At once Africa’s blood arose.
<br> 
<br> “G’way now, yo’ sassy I’ishman, if yo’ knows what’s good fo’ yo’se’f. Whoop dar! Look out fo’ yo’se’f!”
<br> 
<br> With this down went Pomp’s woolly head. Forward he shot like a battering ram. The result was comical enough.
