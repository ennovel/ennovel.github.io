THE PROFESSOR’S ADVENTURE.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      Then Frank Reade, Jr.’s premise proved correct. However, no open attack was made upon the Dart.
<br> 
<br> But it happened in as bad a way, in fact, much worse. Professor Gaston was out upon an exploring tour.
<br> 
<br> The professor was enriching his collection of rare fossils, and was about a quarter of a mile from the airship when attacked.
<br> 
<br> Suddenly and without warning he found himself surrounded by the Esquimaux. He blew his whistle.
<br> 
<br> The professor’s Winchester was under his arm. He could have shot a couple of them, but he knew that it would mean his instant death.
<br> 
<br> “White man gib gun to Eskimo!” said the leader. “Come along! Be prisoner. Mebbe so he live, mebbe not so, he die!”
<br> 
<br> “Hold on!” said the shrewd scientist. “Just wait until I return and I will bring you some more guns.”
<br> 
<br> “No! White man stay. Mebbe no come back. Stay here!”
<br> 
<br> Gaston saw that he was in for it. Yet he did not believe for a moment that his life was as yet in special danger.
<br> 
<br> He ransacked his brain in vain for a subterfuge by which to foil the Esquimaux. But each time he was disappointed.
<br> 
<br> Finally he was led away into the fir forest. A few moments more of delay and he would have been rescued by his friends.
<br> 
<br> Frank was in the engine-room when he heard the whistle of alarm.
<br> 
<br> “Quick, then!” cried Frank. “Pomp, you stay with the airship.”
<br> 
<br> Barney and Spencer grabbed their rifles and followed Frank. Soon they had reached the spot where the professor had been seized by the Esquimaux.
<br> 
<br> Their tracks were seen and understood at once by Frank.
<br> 
<br> All search was of no avail. It was known that the professor was in the hands of the Esquimaux and that was all.
<br> 
<br> Back to the airship the three men went and to work.
<br> 
<br> Meanwhile the professor was having some thrilling experiences.
<br> 
<br> As the party tramped on the professor could not help wondering what his fate was to be.
<br> 
<br> He was not left long in doubt.
<br> 
<br> Suddenly the party came out of the fir forest and were in sight of a long, level plain extending down to the sea.
<br> 
<br> And near the water’s edge were a number of huts made of brush and bark. This was the manner of habitation used by the Esquimaux of this region in lieu of ice.
<br> 
<br> Perhaps there were a hundred or more of these huts.
<br> 
<br> A vast throng of Esquimaux came out to meet them.
<br> 
<br> The prisoner was surrounded by a howling mob. Some of them seemed disposed to do him harm.
<br> 
<br> But the leader of the band kept them back in his persuasive way, by swinging his battle-club about him.
<br> 
<br> The prisoner was led down into the Esquimau settlement. His arms and legs were bound with thongs, and he was unceremoniously tumbled upon the ground.
<br> 
<br> As he lay in the midst of his foes thus, the professor fell to wondering if his whistle of alarm had been heard at the airship.
<br> 
<br> If it had there was good reason to believe that he might expect help and perhaps rescue.
<br> 
<br> But as time passed and his friends did not appear he began to give up hope.
<br> 
<br> His position was becoming unendurable, when suddenly the Esquimau chief appeared and gave some orders to his men.
<br> 
<br> The prisoner was lifted and the thongs which bound his feet being severed he was commanded to stand up.
<br> 
<br> Then the Esquimau chief said, in broken English:
<br> 
<br> “White man mebbe live. He gib Eskimo man more gun and more fire dust. See?”
<br> 
<br> The professor grasped the situation.
<br> 
<br> “All right,” he said; “let me go and I’ll get the guns for you.”
<br> 
<br> But the chief smiled in a leering way.
<br> 
<br> “Eskimo no fool! White man go, mebbe stay. No come back, Eskimo be big fool.”
<br> 
<br> “Well, then, how am I to get the guns for you?” argued the professor.
<br> 
<br> “Mebbe see.”
<br> 
<br> The chief beckoned to one of the tribe, a muscular fellow, who came forward.
<br> 
<br> “He go tell you people he want gun, see! You tell him.”
<br> 
<br> Gaston was not disposed to be reckless.
<br> 
<br> He saw at once that if he could not gain all the pie at least a piece would be better than nothing at all.
<br> 
<br> He realized that if his friends were thus notified of his predicament they would adopt some speedy plan for his rescue.
<br> 
<br> So he said:
<br> 
<br> “Very well, chief. Send your man to my friends. They will give you guns, and then you shall set me free.”
<br> 
<br> The Esquimaux now all seemed to be waiting for the return of their courier.
<br> 
<br> Frank had just finished his job of repairing the machinery when the Esquimaux’ messenger arrived.
<br> 
<br> “Well, you greasy rascal, what do you want?” he asked.
<br> 
<br> “Heap gun!” was the reply. “Mebbe you give me, mebbe no kill you man. See?”
<br> 
<br> “Ah!” said Frank, with comprehension. “You have got one of our men in your clutches, eh?”
<br> 
<br> “Yep!” replied the Esquimau.
<br> 
<br> “Come aboard this airship and I’ll go with you.”
<br> 
<br> But this did not strike the wretch’s fancy.
<br> 
<br> “No, mebbe not,” he said, shaking his head violently. “Mebbe gib me guns!”
<br> 
<br> “Mebbe I won’t,” said Frank, sternly. “Come over, or die!”
<br> 
<br> He aimed a revolver at the villain. The Esquimau knew what that meant and began to beg.
<br> 
<br> “Mebbe no kill me. Sabe white man. He live, no kill me!”
<br> 
<br> “You diabolical shark, you!” cried Frank, grabbing the miscreant’s collar. “Come aboard here, and no fooling!”
<br> 
<br> And Frank pulled him over the rail where he lay cowering upon the deck.
<br> 
<br> “Now, Barney,” he cried, “send her up!”
<br> 
<br> Barney needed no second command.
<br> 
<br> The airship sprang into the air. She was as steady once more as a humming top.
<br> 
<br> Over the fir forest she sped. It was hardly ten minutes before the Esquimau village was in sight.
<br> 
<br> The natives at sight of the airship seemed imbued with terror.
<br> 
<br> They retreated with dismay into their bough huts.
<br> 
<br> Frank allowed the airship to descend right on the verge of the settlement. Then he picked up the shivering wretch on the deck and hurled him over the rail.
<br> 
<br> “Go tell your chief I want to see him,” he said.
<br> 
<br> In a few moments the Esquimau chief sullenly appeared.
<br> 
<br> As he stood with folded arms by his bough hut Frank addressed him:
<br> 
<br> “You greasy scoundrel! You thought to make a treaty with me and force me to give you firearms, did you? Why, I’ve a mind to annihilate the whole tribe of you!”
<br> 
<br> The Esquimau flashed a leering, contemptuous glance at Frank and replied:
<br> 
<br> “White man mebbe fly in air; but Eskimo man no ’fraid ob him.”
