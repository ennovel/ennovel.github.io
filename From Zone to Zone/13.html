THE END.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      Frank was amazed at the cool nerve and effrontery of the wretch. For a moment the young inventor was silent.
<br> 
<br> Then he said:
<br> 
<br> “You have one of our men in captivity here. I want him.”
<br> 
<br> The chief shook his head sullenly.
<br> 
<br> “What?”
<br> 
<br> “Mebbe no.”
<br> 
<br> “Mebbe, yes!” cried Frank, angrily. “Come, I’ll blow you to perdition if you don’t give him up!”
<br> 
<br> “No can do dat.”
<br> 
<br> “Why?”
<br> 
<br> “White man killed!”
<br> 
<br> For a moment Frank reeled as if given a terrific blow. He turned ghastly pale. Then Gaston was dead.
<br> 
<br> “That is awful!” he thought.
<br> 
<br> But something in the Esquimau chief’s face caused him to start. He grasped the situation at once.
<br> 
<br> “You are lying!” he hissed, leaning over the rail. “Give him up, or I’ll kill you and all your cowardly crew!”
<br> 
<br> The Esquimau chief laughed scornfully, and gave a peculiar cry. In a moment the vicinity was thronged with armed natives.
<br> 
<br> Frank saw that the crisis had come. There was no use in dallying further.
<br> 
<br> He picked up a bomb brought him by Barney and hurled it fairly into the midst of the murderous horde.
<br> 
<br> In a flash there was a frightful explosion. Heaps of dead and dying Esquimaux lay upon the ground.
<br> 
<br> The survivors fled wildly. Frank leaped from the airship’s deck. He rushed into the nearest bough hut.
<br> 
<br> There was Gaston bound hand and foot.
<br> 
<br> “Thank God! you have come to save me!” cried the scientist. “You are none too soon!”
<br> 
<br> “But there is yet danger!” cried Frank. “Follow me quickly!”
<br> 
<br> To the airship they rushed. The Esquimaux were recovering and seemed ready to fight. But though he could have annihilated the whole gang, Frank did not wait for their attack.
<br> 
<br> Up into the air sprang the airship.
<br> 
<br> The course was at once set to the southward and for a week was firmly held. Then evidences of civilization appeared.
<br> 
<br> Canada was passed over, Lake Erie and then the United States was once more beneath the aerial voyagers.
<br> 
<br> Home again! There was an indescribable charm in the words.
<br> 
<br> The airship descended into Readestown one evening. The next morning every daily paper in the world was recording the return of the travelers from zone to zone.
<br> 
<br> James Spencer returned to his home where he was happily welcomed.
<br> 
<br> Professor Gaston took the first train to New York and reported to the committee of the scientific society.
<br> 
<br> The much-mooted question of the two Poles was settled forever. Professor Gaston was instantly made honorary member in every scientific society in the world.
<br> 
<br> Indeed, the honors thrust upon him were most burdensome.
<br> 
<br> Barney and Pomp were pleased to once more return to their duties in quiet old Readestown.
<br> 
<br> “I don’ fink I want berry much to do wif dem Arctic countries!” Pomp declared. “Dey am a pooty po’ place fo’ a live man.”
<br> 
<br> “Bejabers, I’m wid yez, naygur!” cried Barney. “Hurroo fer ould Oireland an’ Afriky!”
<br> 
<br> “And hurrah for America, the queen of all nations!” cried Frank Reade, Jr., with a laugh, for he had overheard them.
<br> 
<br> The Dart was at once taken to pieces. The strain of her long voyage would preclude any possibility of ever using her again.
<br> 
<br> But the young inventor had plenty of other plans to develop.
<br> 
<br> For many a day the famous trip of Frank Reade, Jr., and his airship, the Dart, from zone to zone, rang through the country.
<br> 
<br> But though this was certainly a most extraordinary feat, the young inventor had even mightier projects on hand, some of which the reader may hear of at a later day.
