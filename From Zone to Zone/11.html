<br> 
<br> Pomp was an adept at the business, and soon the six pelts were stored away on board the airship.
<br> 
<br> Then it was decided to ascend and continue the journey to the Pole.
<br> 
<br> “We ought to locate that very-much-sought spot in two days more,” declared Frank; “then we are homeward bound.”
<br> 
<br> Somehow the sound of the words “homeward bound” had begun to have a powerful charm for the explorers.
<br> 
<br> The time they had been absent and the thrilling experiences which had been theirs were certainly sufficient to satisfy the most fastidious seeker of wild adventure.
<br> 
<br> “Surely it will seem good to see home once more,” declared Gaston, warmly. “And think of the honor which awaits us!”
<br> 
<br> Pomp now lacked the co-operation of Barney in clearing the snow from the deck of the airship and its rigging.
<br> 
<br> But Frank and Gaston lent their services in this. Soon the deck was quite clear and ship-shape.
<br> 
<br> Then the rotascope was raised and the wings expanded.
<br> 
<br> The machinery was tried to see that no harm had come to it. Then all was in readiness for the start.
<br> 
<br> But just as Frank was about to enter the pilot-house a wild cry escaped Pomp’s lips.
<br> 
<br> “Fo’ de Lor’ sakes, Marse Frank!” he screamed, “jes’ cast yo’ eye ober yender!”
<br> 
<br> Frank did so. The sight which rewarded his gaze was a thrilling one.
<br> 
<br> Painfully clambering over an icy ridge near were two men. As they reached its summit and were in full view of the airship one of them shouted:
<br> 
<br> “Help! Help!”
<br> 
<br> “Great heavens!” was Frank’s wild cry, “that is Barney!”
<br> 
<br> “Barney!” gasped the professor.
<br> 
<br> “Yes, back from the dead!”
<br> 
<br> “Massy sakes, it am his ghostis!” cried Pomp, in terror. “Don’ go ober dere, Marse Frank!”
<br> 
<br> “Don’t be a fool!” cried Frank, angrily. “Come along, both of you!”
<br> 
<br> Gaston followed Frank instantly.
<br> 
<br> Barney it was, and but just alive. The Celt was covered with a coating of ice.
<br> 
<br> The man with him was shrunken to a shadow, with pale, cadaverous features. He could hardly creep along and blood marked his course over the snow.
<br> 
<br> “Barney!” cried Frank, rushing up to the spot. “Thank God you are alive! How did you come here, and who is this?”
<br> 
<br> “Begorra, Misther Frank, it’s a long swim I had!” replied Barney. “An’ it’s nigh dead I am wid me wet clothes. Shure, we’ll tell yez all about it whin we get warm!”
<br> 
<br> “Help us, for the love of God!” said the pallid wretch in a whisper.
<br> 
<br> Nothing more was said until the two exhausted men were helped aboard the airship.
<br> 
<br> Then Barney was undressed and thawed out, and both were given hot drink and food.
<br> 
<br> The Celt’s story was brief and succinct.
<br> 
<br> “Shure, whin I fell into that hole,” he declared, “fer toime me head was under wather. Then I cum up into the air an’ all was dark.
<br> 
<br> “I felt mesilf being carried along by the current, an’ thin all became loight agin an’ I kem out into daylight wanst more. I was carried about a moile below here, to a big, open basin av wather. I cloimbed out, an’ shure there in the ice I saw the hull av a big ship.
<br> 
<br> “Masts nor riggin’ there was none, only the hull. An’ whin I wint up to it this gintleman crawled out an’ spoke to me. Shure, he kin tell his story betther than me.”
<br> 
<br> “Golly! but I am done glad fo’ to see yo’ safe agin, I’ish!” cried Pomp, with glistening eyes.
<br> 
<br> “Shure, an’ it’s glad I am to be wid yez wanst again!” replied Barney.
<br> 
<br> The Arctic refugee now began, in a weak, quavering voice to tell his story.
<br> 
<br> “Three years I have passed in thus cursed clime!” he declared. “All has been solitude like unto death. Oh, God! the horror of that time!
<br> 
<br> “Three years ago our brig, the Valiant, in command of Captain Alexander Bent, was nipped by the ice and drifted hither, after many months of futile attempt to liberate her.
<br> 
<br> “I was the first mate, James Spencer, and I am to-day the only survivor. Within six months from the nipping of the ship every member of the crew of twelve men, save myself, were dead.
<br> 
<br> “A fearful disease struck us and all had it but me. I prayed to have it, but fate ordered otherwise.
<br> 
<br> “I buried them all, one by one, in the ice. Then I was left in solitude. For three years I lived on the stores of the ship.
<br> 
<br> “But last week the last biscuit gave out. I had no longer strength to hunt. I had given myself up to die when this man appeared before me. Even now it seems as if I must be dreaming.”
<br> 
<br> “No,” replied Frank, cheerily, “you are not dreaming. Cheer up, my good man, for you are sure of getting back home.”
<br> 
<br> “What!” cried the castaway. “Do not mock me. You are cast away here like me?”
<br> 
<br> “No; this is our ship.”
<br> 
<br> “Ah, but you will never sail it home. This ice will never break up.”
<br> 
<br> “You are wrong!” cried Frank. “This is an airship. We sail in the air.”
<br> 
<br> “An airship!” the poor fellow passed his hand across his brow in a troubled manner. “No, no; it is really a dream! I shall soon awake, as I have many times before.”
<br> 
<br> Then he lapsed into a revery.
<br> 
<br> “Let him be!” said Frank, compassionately. “Poor fellow, his brain is weak. He will be stronger soon.”
<br> 
<br> Barney was soon himself again and as chipper as ever. There was no reason now why the journey should not be continued.
<br> 
<br> Spencer, the castaway, was asleep. The airship was soon aloft in the air and speeding on its way.
<br> 
<br> Frank, as well as possible, took his bearings.
<br> 
<br> “Barely two days more!” he declared. “Then we shall reach the North Pole!”
<br> 
<br> “We have heard much of the open Polar sea,” declared Professor Gaston. “Now we shall have a chance to prove it.”
<br> 
<br> “Right!” cried Frank. “And it is really in existence!”
<br> 
<br> “You know that?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, I do.”
<br> 
<br> The airship sped on for hours. As Frank had predicted, just two days were occupied in reaching the Pole.
<br> 
<br> In the meantime Spencer had come to himself and was overwhelmed with amazement at his position.
<br> 
<br> “An airship!” he exclaimed. “The impossible has come to pass! I really cannot realize that I am going home!”
<br> 
<br> Then great joy became his. Truly it was not to be wondered at, for he might regard it as being almost equivalent to being brought back from death to life.
<br> 
<br> When the exact locality of the Pole was reached all were disappointed.
<br> 
<br> It was a cold, blustering spot; a sort of elevation among hills of rugged rock, now, however, heavily coated with ice and snow.
<br> 
<br> “Now for home!” cried Frank. “Our journey is near its end!”
<br> 
<br> The mention of home had a magic sound. But thrilling events were yet in store.
<br> 
<br> The course taken by Frank was a straight line for the Arctic Islands and Hudson’s Bay.
<br> 
<br> For days the airship kept steadily on this course.
<br> 
<br> Baffin’s Land and many of the small islands in the Gulf of Bothnia were passed over in the flight.
<br> 
<br> Then the waters of Hudson’s Bay burst upon the view of the voyagers.
<br> 
<br> It was truly a wonderful sight.
<br> 
<br> The course was along the east shore of Hudson’s Bay. When near James Bay and at the mouth of the Great Whale River an astounding thing happened.
<br> 
<br> Suddenly and without warning the airship began to fall.
<br> 
<br> “Great heavens!” cried Professor Gaston. “What has happened?”
<br> 
<br> “Something is wrong!” cried Frank Reade, Jr., “the machinery has failed us!”
<br> 
<br> However this was it was certain that the airship was bound to reach the earth. The rotascope and wings seemed to have lost their power.
<br> 
<br> Barney, who was in the pilot-house, steered the Dart to a good landing place just in the verge of a forest of firs.
<br> 
<br> The waters of the bay were not one hundred yards distant.
<br> 
<br> Had the airship fallen into them the result would have been serious enough. It would have meant death.
<br> 
<br> But fortunately they were to alight on shore. Down settled the airship until it struck the earth.
<br> 
<br> Then Frank went over the machinery critically. He found the defect as he had believed he should in the machinery.
<br> 
<br> He located the break and then said to his anxious companions:
<br> 
<br> “It can be repaired, but it will require a couple of days to do it in.”
<br> 
<br> This meant a delay, and just at a time when all were anxious to reach home. Yet no demur was made.
<br> 
<br> The anchors were put out and then work was begun.
<br> 
<br> As Frank had predicted there was a couple of days’ work on the machinery. The job was pushed forward as rapidly as possible and had been nearly completed when an exciting incident occurred.
<br> 
<br> Suddenly in the water of the bay there appeared a number of the peculiar Esquimau canoes, known as kayaks.
<br> 
<br> In each was an Esquimau equipped for seal hunting.
<br> 
<br> They landed and approached the airship. Short and squatty in figure they were, with greasy countenances. A more villainous-looking set had never been seen by the voyagers.
<br> 
<br> They conversed with Frank for a while in broken English, and then went away. As they disappeared Frank said, with conviction:
<br> 
<br> “Do you know I do not believe we have seen the last of them. I feel sure that we shall have trouble.”
<br> 
<br> “You may be sure of that!” declared Spencer. “I know something about their race, and I tell you they are a bad lot.”
<br> 
<br> “Begorra, ther’s enough av us to whip them!” averred Barney.
<br> 
<br> “That may be true,” agreed Frank, “but it will put us to the unpleasant necessity of killing a few of them.”
<br> 
<br> That night a careful guard was kept. Barney and Pomp watched alternately. But it was not until the next day, that the real trouble came.
