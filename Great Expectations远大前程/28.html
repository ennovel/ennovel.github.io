Our time of starting from the Cross Keys was two o'clock. I arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to spare, attended by the Avenger - if I may connect that expression with one who never attended on me if he could possibly help it.</p> 
<p>At that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dockyards by stage-coach. As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside passengers, and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling their ironed legs over the coach roof, I had no cause to be surprised when Herbert, meeting me in the yard, came up and told me there were two convicts going down with me. But I had a reason that was an old reason now, for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the world convict.</p> 
<p>`You don't mind them, Handel?' said Herbert.</p> 
<p>`Oh no!'</p> 
<p>`I thought you seemed as if you didn't like them?'</p> 
<p>`I can't pretend that I do like them, and I suppose you don't particularly. But I don't mind them.'</p> 
<p>`See! There they are,' said Herbert, `coming out of the Tap. What a degraded and vile sight it is!'</p> 
<p>They had been treating their guard, I suppose, for they had a gaoler with them, and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands. The two convicts were handcuffed together, and had irons on their legs - irons of a pattern that I knew well. They wore the dress that I likewise knew well. Their keeper had a brace of pistols, and carried a thick-knobbed bludgeon under his arm; but he was on terms of good understanding with them, and stood, with them beside him, looking on at the putting-to of the horses, rather with an air as if the convicts were an interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment, and he the Curator. One was a taller and stouter man than the other, and appeared as a matter of course, according to the mysterious ways of the world both convict and free, to have had allotted to him the smaller suit of clothes. His arms and legs were like great pincushions of those shapes, and his attire disguised him absurdly; but I knew his half-closed eye at one glance. There stood the man whom I had seen on the settle at the Three Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night, and who had brought me down with his invisible gun!</p> 
<p>It was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had never seen me in his life. He looked across at me, and his eye appraised my watch-chain, and then he incidentally spat and said something to the other convict, and they laughed and slued themselves round with a clink of their coupling manacle, and looked at something else. The great numbers on their backs, as if they were street doors; their coarse mangy ungainly outer surface, as if they were lower animals; their ironed legs, apologetically garlanded with pocket-handkerchiefs; and the way in which all present looked at them and kept from them; made them (as Herbert had said) a most disagreeable and degraded spectacle.</p> 
<p>But this was not the worst of it. It came out that the whole of the back of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London, and that there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in front, behind the coachman. Hereupon, a choleric gentleman, who had taken the fourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent passion, and said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such villainous company, and that it was poisonous and pernicious and infamous and shameful, and I don't know what else. At this time the coach was ready and the coachman impatient, and we were all preparing to get up, and the prisoners had come over with their keeper - bringing with them that curious flavour of bread-poultice, baize, rope-yarn, and hearthstone, which attends the convict presence.</p> 
<p>`Don't take it so much amiss. sir,' pleaded the keeper to the angry passenger; `I'll sit next you myself. I'll put 'em on the outside of the row. They won't interfere with you, sir. You needn't know they're there.'</p> 
<p>`And don't blame me,' growled the convict I had recognized. `I don't want to go. I am quite ready to stay behind. As fur as I am concerned any one's welcome to my place.'</p> 
<p>`Or mine,' said the other, gruffly. `I wouldn't have incommoded none of you, if I'd had my way.' Then, they both laughed, and began cracking nuts, and spitting the shells about. - As I really think I should have liked to do myself, if I had been in their place and so despised.</p> 
<p>At length, it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman, and that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind. So, he got into his place, still making complaints, and the keeper got into the place next him, and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as they could, and the convict I had recognized sat behind me with his breath on the hair of my head.</p> 
<p>`Good-bye, Handel!' Herbert called out as we started. I thought what a blessed fortune it was, that he had found another name for me than Pip.</p> 
<p>It is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convict's breathing, not only on the back of my head, but all along my spine. The sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and searching acid, it set my very teeth on edge. He seemed to have more breathing business to do than another man, and to make more noise in doing it; and I was conscious of growing high-shoulderd on one side, in my shrinking endeavours to fend him off.</p> 
<p>The weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold. It made us all lethargic before we had gone far, and when we had left the Half-way House behind, we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent. I dozed off, myself, in considering the question whether I ought to restore a couple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him, and how it could best be done. In the act of dipping forward as if I were going to bathe among the horses, I woke in a fright and took the question up again.</p> 
<p>But I must have lost it longer than I had thought, since, although I could recognize nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and shadows of our lamps, I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that blew at us. Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against the wind, the convicts were closer to me than before. They very first words I heard them interchange as I became conscious were the words of my own thought, `Two One Pound notes.'</p> 
<p>`How did he get 'em?' said he convict I had never seen.</p> 
<p>`How should I know?' returned the other. `He had 'em stowed away somehows. Giv him by friends, I expect.'</p> 
<p>`I wish,' said the other, with a bitter curse upon the cold, `that I had 'em here.'</p> 
<p>`Two one pound notes, or friends?'</p> 
<p>`Two one pound notes. I'd sell all the friends I ever had, for one, and think it a blessed good bargain. Well? So he says - ?'</p> 
<p>`So he says,' resumed the convict I had recognized - `it was all said and done in half a minute, behind a pile of timber in the Dockyard - "You're a going to be discharged?" Yes, I was. Would I find out that boy that had fed him and kep his secret, and give him them two one pound notes? Yes, I would. And I did.'</p> 
<p>`More fool you,' growled the other. `I'd have spent 'em on a Man, in wittles and drink. He must have been a green one. Mean to say he knowed nothing of you?'</p> 
<p>`Not a ha'porth. Different gangs and different ships. He was tried again for prison breaking, and got made a Lifer.'</p> 
<p>`And was that - Honour! - the only time you worked out, in this part of the country?'</p> 
<p>`The only time.'</p> 
<p>`What might have been your opinion of the place?'</p> 
<p>`A most beastly place. Mudbank, mist, swamp, and work; work, swamp, mist, and mudbank.'</p> 
<p>They both execrated the place in very strong language, and gradually growled themselves out, and had nothing left to say.</p> 
<p>After overhearing this dialogue, I should assuredly have got down and been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway, but for feeling certain that the man had no suspicion of my identity. Indeed, I was not only so changed in the course of nature, but so differently dressed and so differently circumstanced, that it was not at all likely he could have known me without accidental help. Still, the coincidence of our being together on the coach, was sufficiently strange to fill me with a dread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me, in his hearing, with my name. For this reason, I resolved to alight as soon as we touched the town, and put myself out of his hearing. This device I executed successfully. My little portmanteau was in the boot under my feet; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out: I threw it down before me, got down after it, and was left at the first lamp on the first stones of the town pavement. As to the convicts, they went their way with the coach, and I knew at what point they would be spirited off to the river. In my fancy, I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting for them at the slime-washed stairs, - again heard the gruff `Give way, you!' like and order to dogs - again saw the wicked Noah's Ark lying out on the black water.</p> 
<p>I could not have said what I was afraid of, for my fear was altogether undefined and vague, but there was great fear upon me. As I walked on to the hotel, I felt that a dread, much exceeding the mere apprehension of a painful of disagreeable recognition, made me tremble. I am confident that it took no distinctness of shape, and that it was the revival for a few minutes of the terror of childhood.</p> 
<p>The coffee-room at the Blue Boar was empty, and I had not only ordered my dinner there, but had sat down to it, before the waiter knew me. As soon as he had apologized for the remissness of his memory, he asked me if he should send Boots for Mr Pumblechook?</p> 
<p>`No,' said I, `certainly not.'</p> 
<p>The waiter (it was he who had brought up the Great Remonstrance from the Commercials, on the day when I was bound) appeared surprised, and took the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of a local newspaper so directly in my way, that I took it up and read this paragraph:</p> 
<p>Our readers will learn, not altogether without interest, in reference to the recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of this neighbourhood (what a theme, by the way, for the magic pen of our as yet not universally acknowledged townsman TOOBY, the poet of our columns!) that the youth's earliest patron, companion, and friend, was a highly-respected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn and seed trade, and whose eminently convenient and commodious business premises are situate within a hundred miles of the High-street. It is not wholly irrespective of our personal feelings that we record HIM as the Mentor of our young Telemachus, for it is good to know that our town produced the founder of the latter's fortunes. Does the thoughtcontracted brow of the local Sage or the lustrous eye of local Beauty inquire whose fortunes? We believe that Quintin Matsys was the BLACKSMITH of Antwerp. VERB. SAP.</p> 
<p>I entertain a conviction, based upon large experience, that if in the days of my prosperity I had gone to the North Pole, I should have met somebody there, wandering Esquimaux or civilized man, who would have told me that Pumblechook was my earliest patron and the founder of my fortunes.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>显然，第二天我将不得不回到我故乡的小镇。一开始，由于内心的忏悔和歉意，所以觉得很自然我该住在乔的家里。后来，我预定好次日返镇的马车，到鄱凯特先生家去请过假，心情又起了变化，踌躇不定是不是要住在乔的家里，于是我编造各种理由为自己开脱，说我应该住在蓝野猪饭店。什么住在乔家中会带来许多不便啦；什么我突如其来地跑去，他们对我的住宿会一无准备啦；什么我住的地方不能离郝维仙小姐的家过远，她这个人十分严厉，不能使她不高兴啦。天下所有的骗子比起自我欺骗的人来就算不上什么了，而我就是这样一个自我编造理由来欺骗自己的人。我干的就是这么奇怪的事。假使我把别人的假币当作真币收下来，那是我的无辜所致，不是什么怪事；现在的问题是我明明知道这是我自己造的假币，却骗自己说是真币。要是有一个陌生人，表示对我感谢，假装为了保险起见，替我把钞票用纸包好，暗中却抽去钞票，换上了废纸，这还情有可原；可问题是我自己包上了一堆废纸，却递给自己当作钞票！</p> 
<p>刚刚决定必须住在蓝野猪饭店，在另一个问题上我又犹豫不决了，心头颇为不安，即我究竟该不该带着讨债鬼去呢？如果带上这个穿着讲究的小跟班，让他站在蓝野猪饭店里的马房拱道口显示他的高统皮靴，那有多么得意；而且要是这个讨债鬼突然出现在那个裁缝铺里，准保把那个特拉布所雇的不懂礼貌的小伙计吓得要死。不过，从另一方面看，特拉布的小伙计也许会巴结他，表示热情，把我的一切底细向他揭露；说不定这个小伙计会把我的跟班给轰到街上去，因为我知道他是个轻率鲁莽、不顾死活的家伙。还有，我的女恩主一旦听到这件事，也许不会赞成。前思后想，最后还是决定把讨债鬼留在伦敦。</p> 
<p>我所乘的是在下午开出的一班马车，这时正值冬季来临，所以要到天黑之后两三个小时才能抵达目的地。马车从交叉钥匙形的旅馆招牌那里开出的时间是二时整，因此我提前了一刻钟到达开车地点，由讨债鬼侍候我上车。其实，侍候这个词只是说说而已，如果能够推托，他是不会侍候我的。</p> 
<p>在那个时代，到我们家乡去的驿车上通常要装运几个囚犯送到监狱船去。我过去常听人说起这些坐在车顶上面的乘客，而且也不止一次地亲眼见到过他们，坐在公路上奔驰的马车顶上，悬着两条戴着镣铐的腿，晃来晃去。所以，这次赫伯特赶到车站的院子里为我送行并告诉我今天有几名罪犯在车上和我同行时，我一点不感到大惊小怪。不过，一听到罪犯这个词我就会不自觉地感到畏缩，其实这早已是陈年往事，也没有必要再闻之失色。</p> 
<p>“汉德尔，和囚犯同车你不在意吗？”赫伯特问道。</p> 
<p>“噢，我不在意。”</p> 
<p>“我看你似乎不喜欢他们，是吗？”</p> 
<p>“我不能装出喜欢他们，我想你也不会特别喜欢他们吧。不过我不在意他们。”</p> 
<p>“看，他们来了！”赫伯特说道，“他们从一家小酒吧中出来了。他们看上去多么卑鄙下贱啊！”</p> 
<p>我猜想这两个犯人是去请他们的差官喝酒的，因为他们旁边有一个看守跟着，三个人从酒吧出来都用手擦着嘴巴。这两个犯人手上戴着手铐，腿上戴着脚镣——这种镣铐的样式我很熟悉。他们穿的衣服我也很熟悉。他们的看守带着两把手枪，胳肢窝下还夹着一根结结实实的大头棒，不过他对两个犯人倒很体贴，让他们站在他的旁边，一起看着套马车；从他的态度上看，这两个犯人好似暂时还不作正式展出的展品，而他本人则像一位博物馆馆长。两个犯人中有一个比较高些，也比较强壮，但却穿着一套比较小的囚犯号服。也许这个世界大会捉弄人，无论对犯人或自由人都一个样，许多事都神秘莫测。他的双臂双腿就像大大的针插，衣服紧束在身上使身体都变了样，真令人感到荒谬绝伦。他那只半睁半闭的眼睛，我一眼便认了出来，这就是那个我在三个快乐的船夫酒店看到的人。那是个星期六的夜晚，他坐在长靠椅上，用无形的手枪瞄准着我。</p> 
<p>一望而知，他还没有认出我来，就好像在这一生中从没有见过我一样。他的眼光飘过来望着我，估价着我的表链，然后他随便吐了一口痰，对另一个囚犯说了些什么，他们两人便一齐大笑起来，接着把两个人铐在一起的手铐眶哪一响，他们便又一齐转过身去，望着别的什么东西了。他们号衣的背后写着很大的号码，好像是两扇街道店铺的门。他们皮肤上生着癞疮，又粗糙又难看，真像低等动物。他们腿部过镣铐的地方扎着手帕，也许是为了挡住羞耻。大家都望着他们，却又躲开他们。正如赫伯特所说，他们太卑鄙、太下贱了，简直令人难以人目。</p> 
<p>这可不是最糟的事，最糟的事还在后面。问题在于车顶上的那块地方已经由一户搬离伦敦的人家放满了东西，因此这两个犯人便没有地方坐了，只有坐在车夫后面的一排前座上。有一个易发怒的旅客原来预定的是前排第四个座位，这一来便大动肝火。他说这是破坏合约的行为，竟然让他和如此的无赖同坐，这简直是恶毒的、坏心肠的、卑鄙下流的和可耻的等等，一切骂人的话都用上了。这时马车已准备就绪，车夫本人也不耐烦了，我们全体旅客正准备上车，两个犯人和他们的看守也来了。他们一来就带来一股面包肉汤的气味，还有粗呢子气味、搓绳场的麻绳气味以及炉石的气味。</p> 
<p>“先生，请不要太介意这件事，”看守向那位发脾气的旅客恳求说，“我来坐在你的旁边，让他们两人坐在边上好了。他们一定不会妨碍你的，先生。你只当根本没有这两个人就是了。”</p> 
<p>“不要怪我，”那位我认识的犯人大声喝道，“我本来就不想去，我本来就想留下来。依我所想，谁来代替我都欢迎。”</p> 
<p>“也欢迎代替我，”另一个犯人也粗鲁地说道，“如果以我的方式做，我一定不会妨碍大家。”说毕他们两人大笑起来，并且开始剥硬果吃，果壳随便乱吐。我想，要是我自己也处于他们这种境况，如此地受人轻蔑，我一定也会和他们的行为一样。</p> 
<p>最后，对于这位怒气冲冲的先生来讲毫无补救的余地，要么他认倒霉，和犯人同坐，要么等到下一班再走。他还是上了车，嘴里仍然是抱怨不断，骂骂咧咧的。看守坐在他的旁边，两个犯人也费力地爬上了车。我认识的那位犯人正坐在我后面，嘴里的热气全呼在我的头发上。</p> 
<p>车子离开时，赫伯特对我说：“汉德尔，再见！”我心里暗想，多么幸运啊，亏他给我起了个名字，而没有叫我皮普。</p> 
<p>要描述这位犯人的呼气有多么剧烈是不可能的，不仅一口口热气喷在我后脑勺上，而且顺着我的脊梁骨向各处分散，一直钻进我的骨髓，还带着一股酸味，一直酸到牙齿的根上。他呼出的气比任何一个人都多，呼气的声音也比任何一个人都响亮。我只有蜷缩身体，尽量忍受住他的呼气，不过这样一来，我感到自己一边的肩越耸越高。</p> 
<p>天气是要人命的阴湿，这两个犯人一直在抱怨着寒冷。马车还没有走多远，我们大家似乎都进入了冬眠状态，感觉迟钝，兴趣索然。马车一过中途的驿站，我们干脆哆哆嗦嗦地打起瞌睡来，一声不响地保持着安静。我思考着究竟要不要在他离开马车之前把两镑钱还给这位犯人，用什么样的方法还更好，就这样我自己也沉入了梦乡。突然，我身子向前一冲，好像自己要跳进马群里一样，在一阵惊恐之中醒来，于是刚才的问题又出现在心中。</p> 
<p>我想我一定睡着了很长时间，因为车外一片黑暗，闪烁着摇晃的灯影。虽然我双眼辨别不清外面的事物，可是车外吹来阴冷潮湿的风却使我嗅到了故乡沼泽地的气息。我后面的两位犯人缩成一团，越来越靠近我，看来把我当成为他们挡住冷气的屏风了。我听到他们正在谈话，听到的第一件事正是我在思考的“两张一英镑钞票”。</p> 
<p>“他怎么弄到的？”那位我从未见到过的犯人问道。</p> 
<p>“我怎么知道？”另一位犯人答道，“他弄到后也不知道藏在什么地方。总之，我想，是朋友送他的吧。”</p> 
<p>另一位犯人骂了一声寒冷的天气，说：“要是现在有可多好。”</p> 
<p>“有两张一英镑钞票，还是有朋友？”</p> 
<p>“有两镑钞票。我可以为一张一英镑钞票出卖所有的朋友，一英镑钞票便可以成交。唔，所以他说——？”</p> 
<p>“所以他说，”我认识的那位犯人答道，“他在船坞里的一堆木材后面对我说的，只不过半分钟时间，他说，‘你很快就要被放出去！’是的，那时我就要释放了。他问我愿不愿意找到那个给过他饭吃又为他保守了秘密的孩子，把这两张一英镑的钞票给他。我答应了他，我也做到了。”</p> 
<p>“你这个天大的傻瓜，”另一位犯人愤愤地说，“要是换成我，老子就要像个人一样花个痛快，去吃喝一顿。他一定是个生手。你不是说他对你一无所知吗？”</p> 
<p>“他不认识我，我们是两帮子，关在两条船上。后来他因为越狱，抓住后被判为无期徒刑。”</p> 
<p>“说真的，你在这一带乡下干活只那么一次，是吗？”</p> 
<p>“就只一次。”</p> 
<p>“你对这儿有什么看法？”</p> 
<p>“这是个最恶劣的地方，泥泞、大雾、沼泽、苦役；苦役、大雾、沼泽。泥泞。”</p> 
<p>他们两人都用最刻毒的语言咒骂这个地方，最后骂得没有词了，才慢慢地停了下来。</p> 
<p>我偷听了他们的这一段对话之后，真想立刻下车，离开这里，躲到公路上一处僻静黑暗的地方。幸亏这个犯人没有对我产生怀疑，没有认出我来。确实，我本人也长大了，完全变了样，穿的衣服不同了，所处的地位也不同了，如果不遇到特殊情况，没有神鬼的帮助，任他怎样也不会把我认出来的。不过话又说回来，天下事无奇不有，这次既然能偶然巧合同乘一辆马车，就完全可能有另外的巧合，说不定在什么时候，哪里冒出一个人直呼我的名字，他们一听就会认出我。正是出于这一担心，我决定马车一进镇子就下车，及早离开他们远远的。我的这一设想实施得相当成功，小手提箱就放在车厢里我的脚旁，不用费劲就可把箱子拉出来。当车子停在镇口第一处石级上的第一盏路灯旁时，我先把手提箱放下车，随即自己也跳下了车。至于这两个罪犯，他们还得随马车而去，我知道他们要被押送到那条河边。在我的脑海中，仿佛出现了一条由犯人划的船，正在一处被泥溅得又脏又滑的小码头边等着；耳朵中仿佛又听到了像骂狗似的粗鲁声音：“你们快划！”眼睛仿佛又看到了在那一片黑色的水面上停着一艘罪孽深重的挪亚方舟。</p> 
<p>我根本说不出自己究竟怕什么，因为我的担心是说不清的，是模糊的，只是有一种莫大的恐惧压在心头。一路向着旅馆走去的时候，我感到有一种恐惧，这种恐惧不是仅仅怕被认出来而感到痛苦和难受，而且也就是这种恐惧使我瑟瑟发抖。现在想起来，那时的恐惧是说不出缘由的，莫名其妙的，只不过是童年时代的恐惧暂时复苏而已。</p> 
<p>蓝野猪饭店的咖啡厅中空无一人，直到我叫了饭菜，坐下来开始用膳时，茶房才认出了我。他连忙向我道歉，说一时没有想起来，并且问我，是不是要派人去给彭波契克先生送个信？”</p> 
<p>“用不着，”我说道，“确实用不着。”</p> 
<p>这位茶房就是上次我和乔定师徒合同在这里吃饭时，跑上来转达楼下客商提出严重抗议的茶房。他听了我的口答，显得很惊奇，抓紧机会递过一张肮脏的旧报纸，我拿起来读到下面一段文章：</p> 
<p>“不久前，本镇附近的一家铁匠铺中，有一位青年铁匠传奇般地飞黄腾达了。想来读者对此一定颇感兴趣（但愿本镇的作家、本专栏的诗人托比，能够运用他的诗才，对此作一佳文，虽然他目前尚未名扬天下）。这位青年的早期恩主、同伴和朋友，是一位非常值得尊敬的人，他从事粮食和种子生意，公司宽敞方便，设备齐全，在大街的百里之内，久负盛名。这位恩主简直和《奥德赛》中泰勒马库斯的老师一样，我们听之不能无动于衷。他为别人奠定下了幸福的基础，我们都该引以为骄傲。我镇是否有善于深思的圣贤或者能明察事理的佳丽想探求一下究竞是谁得到如此幸运？我们只要一提大画家昆丁·莫赛斯曾经是安特卫普的铁匠，就一语道破天机，无须穷究。”</p> 
<p>从大量的经验事实我可以断定，在我飞黄腾达的日子里，即使我去到北极，不论遇到的是游牧的爱斯基摩人，或是文明人，都会对我说，我早年的恩公、我幸运的奠基人不是别人，乃是彭波契克。</p>
