<p>`No,' said I.</p> 
<p>`No,' he acquiesced: `I heard it had happened very lately. I was rather on the look-out for good-fortune then.'</p> 
<p>`Indeed?'</p> 
<p>`Yes. Miss Havisham had sent for me, to see if she could take a fancy to me. But she couldn't - at all events, she didn't.'</p> 
<p>I thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that.</p> 
<p>`Bad taste,' said Herbert, laughing, `but a fact. Yes, she had sent for me on a trial visit, and if I had come out of it successfully, I suppose I should have been provided for; perhaps I should have been what-you-may-called it to Estella.'</p> 
<p>`What's that?' I asked, with sudden gravity.</p> 
<p>He was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked, which divided his attention, and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word. `Affianced,' he explained, still busy with the fruit. `Betrothed. Engaged. What's-his-named. Any word of that sort.'</p> 
<p>`How did you bear your disappointment?' I asked.</p> 
<p>`Pooh!' said he, `I didn't care much for it. She's a Tartar.'</p> 
<p>`Miss Havisham?'</p> 
<p>`I don't say no to that, but I meant Estella. That girl's hard and haughty and capricious to the last degree, and has been brought up by Miss Havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex.'</p> 
<p>`What relation is she to Miss Havisham?'</p> 
<p>`None,' said he. `Only adopted.'</p> 
<p>`Why should she wreak revenge on all the male sex? What revenge?'</p> 
<p>`Lord, Mr Pip!' said he. `Don't you know?'</p> 
<p>`No,' said I.</p> 
<p>`Dear me! It's quite a story, and shall be saved till dinner-time.</p> 
<p>And now let me take the liberty of asking you a question. How did you come there, that day?'</p> 
<p>I told him, and he was attentive until I had finished, and then burst out laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards? I didn't ask him if he was, for my conviction on that point was perfectly established.</p> 
<p>`Mr Jaggers is your guardian, I understand?' he went on.</p> 
<p>`Yes.'</p> 
<p>`You know he is Miss Havisham's man of business and solicitor, and has her confidence when nobody else has?'</p> 
<p>This was bringing me (I felt) towards dangerous ground. I answered with a constraint I made no attempt to disguise, that I had seen Mr Jaggers in Miss Havisham's house on the very day of our combat, but never at any other time, and that I believed he had no recollection of having ever seen me there.</p> 
<p>`He was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor, and he called on my father to propose it. Of course he knew about my father from his connexion with Miss Havisham. My father is Miss Havisham's cousin; not that that implies familiar intercourse between them, for he is a bad courtier and will not propitiate her.'</p> 
<p>Herbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking. I had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since, who more strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a natural incapacity to do anything secret and mean. There was something wonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that at the same time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich. I don't know how this was. I became imbued with the notion on that first occasion before we sat down to dinner, but I cannot define by what means.</p> 
<p>He was still a pale young gentleman, and had a certain conquered languor about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness, that did not seem indicative of natural strength. He had not a handsome face, but it was better than handsome: being extremely amiable and cheerful. His figure was a little ungainly, as in the days when my knuckles had taken such liberties with it, but it looked as if it would always be light and young. Whether Mr Trabb's local work would have sat more gracefully on him than on me, may be a question; but I am conscious that he carried off his rather old clothes, much better than I carried off my new suit.</p> 
<p>As he was so communicative, I felt that reserve on my part would be a bad return unsuited to our years. I therefore told him my small story, and laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was. I further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in a country place, and knew very little of the ways of politeness, I would take it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever he saw me at a loss or going wrong.</p> 
<p>`With pleasure,' said he, `though I venture to prophesy that you'll want very few hints. I dare say we shall be often together, and I should like to banish any needless restraint between us. Will you do me the favour to begin at once to call me by my christian name, Herbert?'</p> 
<p>I thanked him, and said I would. I informed him in exchange that my christian name was Philip.</p> 
<p>`I don't take to Philip,' said he, smiling, `for it sounds like a moral boy out of the spelling-book, who was so lazy that he fell into a pond, or so fat that he couldn't see out of his eyes, or so avaricious that he locked up his cake till the mice ate it, or so determined to go a bird's-nesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in the neighbourhood. I tell you what I should like. We are so harmonious, and you have been a blacksmith - would you mind it?'</p> 
<p>`I shouldn't mind anything that you propose,' I answered, `but I don't understand you.'</p> 
<p>`Would you mind Handel for a familiar name? There's a charming piece of music by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith.'</p> 
<p>`I should like it very much.'</p> 
<p>`Then, my dear Handel,' said he, turning round as the door opened, `here is the dinner, and I must beg of you to take the top of the table, because the dinner is of your providing.'</p> 
<p>This I would not hear of, so he took the top, and I faced him. It was a nice little dinner - seemed to me then, a very Lord Mayor's Feast - and it acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent circumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us. This again was heightened by a certain gipsy character that set the banquet off; for, while the table was, as Mr Pumblechook might have said, the lap of luxury - being entirely furnished forth from the coffee-house - the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of a comparatively pastureless and shifty character: imposing on the waiter the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor (where he fell over them), the melted butter in the armchair, the bread on the bookshelves, the cheese in the coalscuttle, and the boiled fowl into my bed in the next room - where I found much of its parsley and butter in a state of congelation when I retired for the night. All this made the feast delightful, and when the waiter was not there to watch me, my pleasure was without alloy.</p> 
<p>We had made some progress in the dinner, when I reminded Herbert of his promise to tell me about Miss Havisham.</p> 
<p>`True,' he replied. `I'll redeem it at once. Let me introduce the topic, Handel, by mentioning that in London it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth - for fear of accidents - and that while the fork is reserved for that use, it is not put further in than necessary. It is scarcely worth mentioning, only it's as well to do as other people do. Also, the spoon is not generally used over-hand, but under. This has two advantages. You get at your mouth better (which after all is the object), and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening oysters, on the part of the right elbow.'</p> 
<p>He offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that we both laughed and I scarcely blushed.</p> 
<p>`Now,' he pursued, `concerning Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham, you must know, was a spoilt child. Her mother died when she was a baby, and her father denied her nothing. Her father was a country gentleman down in your part of the world, and was a brewer. I don't know why it should be a crack thing to be a brewer; but it is indisputable that while you cannot possibly be genteel and bake, you may be as genteel as never was and brew. You see it every day.'</p> 
<p>`Yet a gentleman may not keep a public-house; may he?' said I.</p> 
<p>`Not on any account,' returned Herbert; `but a public-house may keep a gentleman. Well! Mr Havisham was very rich and very proud. So was his daughter.'</p> 
<p>`Miss Havisham was an only child?' I hazarded.</p> 
<p>`Stop a moment, I am coming to that. No, she was not an only child; she had a half-brother. Her father privately married again - his cook, I rather think.'</p> 
<p>`I thought he was proud,' said I.</p> 
<p>`My good Handel, so he was. He married his second wife privately, because he was proud, and in course of time she died. When she was dead, I apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done, and then the son became a part of the family, residing in the house you are acquainted with. As the son grew a young man, he turned out riotous, extravagant, undutiful - altogether bad. At last his father disinherited him; but he softened when he was dying, and left him well off, though not nearly so well off as Miss Havisham. - Take another glass of wine, and excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one to be so strictly conscientious in emptying one's glass, as to turn it bottom upwards with the rim on one's nose.'</p> 
<p>I had been doing this, in an excess of attention to his recital. I thanked him, and apologized. He said, `Not at all,' and resumed.</p> 
<p>`Miss Havisham was now an heiress, and you may suppose was looked after as a great match. Her half-brother had now ample means again, but what with debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again. There were stronger differences between him and her, than there had been between him and his father, and it is suspected that he cherished a deep and mortal grudge against her, as having influenced the father's anger. Now, I come to the cruel part of the story - merely breaking off, my dear Handel, to remark that a dinner-napkin will not go into a tumbler.'</p> 
<p>Why I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler, I am wholly unable to say. I only know that I found myself, with a perseverance worthy of a much better cause, making the most strenuous exertions to compress it within those limits. Again I thanked him and apologized, and again he said in the cheerfullest manner, `Not at all, I am sure!' and resumed.</p> 
<p>`There appeared upon the scene - say at the races, or the public balls, or anywhere else you like - a certain man, who made love to Miss Havisham. I never saw him, for this happened five-and-twenty years ago (before you and I were, Handel), but I have heard my father mention that he was a showy-man, and the kind of man for the purpose. But that he was not to be, without ignorance or prejudice, mistaken for a gentleman, my father most strongly asseverates; because it is a principle of his that no man who was not a true gentleman at heart, ever was, since the world began, a true gentleman in manner. He says, no varnish can hide the grain of the wood; and that the more varnish you put on, the more the grain will express itself. Well! This man pursued Miss Havisham closely, and professed to be devoted to her. I believe she had not shown much susceptibility up to that time; but all the susceptibility she possessed, certainly came out then, and she passionately loved him. There is no doubt that she perfectly idolized him. He practised on her affection in that systematic way, that he got great sums of money from her, and he induced her to buy her brother out of a share in the brewery (which had been weakly left him by his father) at an immense price, on the plea that when he was her husband he must hold and manage it all. Your guardian was not at that time in Miss Havisham's councils, and she was too haughty and too much in love, to be advised by any one. Her relations were poor and scheming, with the exception of my father; he was poor enough, but not time-serving or jealous. The only independent one among them, he warned her that she was doing too much for this man, and was placing herself too unreservedly in his power. She took the first opportunity of angrily ordering my father out of the house, in his presence, and my father has never seen her since.'</p> 
<p>I thought of her having said, `Matthew will come and see me at last when I am laid dead upon that table;' and I asked Herbert whether his father was so inveterate against her?</p> 
<p>`It's not that,' said he, `but she charged him, in the presence of her intended husband, with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon her for his own advancement, and, if he were to go to her now, it would look true - even to him - and even to her. To return to the man and make an end of him. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dresses were bought, the wedding tour was planned out, the wedding guests were invited. The day came, but not the bridegroom. He wrote her a letter--'</p> 
<p>`Which she received,' I struck in, `when she was dressing for her marriage? At twenty minutes to nine?'</p> 
<p>`At the hour and minute,' said Herbert, nodding, `at which she afterwards stopped all the clocks. What was in it, further than that it most heartlessly broke the marriage off, I can't tell you, because I don't know. When she recovered from a bad illness that she had, she laid the whole place waste, as you have seen it, and she has never since looked upon the light of day.'</p> 
<p>`Is that all the story?' I asked, after considering it.</p> 
<p>`All I know of it; and indeed I only know so much, through piecing it out for myself; for my father always avoids it, and, even when Miss Havisham invited me to go there, told me no more of it than it was absolutely requisite I should understand. But I have forgotten one thing. It has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced confidence, acted throughout in concert with her half-brother; that it was a conspiracy between them; and that they shared the profits.'</p> 
<p>`I wonder he didn't marry her and get all the property,' said I.</p> 
<p>`He may have been married already, and her cruel mortification may have been a part of her half-brother's scheme,' said Herbert.</p> 
<p>`Mind! I don't know that.'</p> 
<p>`What became of the two men?' I asked, after again considering the subject.</p> 
<p>`They fell into deeper shame and degradation - if there can be deeper - and ruin.'</p> 
<p>`Are they alive now?'</p> 
<p>`I don't know.'</p> 
<p>`You said just now, that Estella was not related to Miss Havisham, but adopted. When adopted?'</p> 
<p>Herbert shrugged his shoulders. `There has always been an Estella, since I have heard of a Miss Havisham. I know no more. And now, Handel,' said he, finally throwing off the story as it were, `there is a perfectly open understanding between us. All that I know about Miss Havisham, you know.'</p> 
<p>`And all that I know,' I retorted, `you know.'</p> 
<p>`I fully believe it. So there can be no competition or perplexity between you and me. And as to the condition on which you hold your advancement in life - namely, that you are not to inquire or discuss to whom you owe it - you may be very sure that it will never be encroached upon, or even approached, by me, or by any one belonging to me.'</p> 
<p>In truth, he said this with so much delicacy, that I felt the subject done with, even though I should be under his father's roof for years and years to come. Yet he said it with so much meaning, too, that I felt he as perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress, as I understood the fact myself.</p> 
<p>It had not occurred to me before, that he had led up to the theme for the purpose of clearing it out of our way; but we were so much the lighter and easier for having broached it, that I now perceived this to be the case. We were very gay and sociable, and I asked him, in the course of conversation, what he was? He replied, `A capitalist - an Insurer of Ships.' I suppose he saw me glancing about the room in search of some tokens of Shipping, or capital, for he added, `In the City.'</p> 
<p>I had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of Ships in the City, and I began to think with awe, of having laid a young Insurer on his back, blackened his enterprising eye, and cut his responsible head open. But, again, there came upon me, for my relief, that odd impression that Herbert Pocket would never be very successful or rich.</p> 
<p>`I shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in insuring ships. I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares, and cut into the Direction. I shall also do a little in the mining way. None of these things will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on my own account. I think I shall trade,' said he, leaning back in his chair, `to the East Indies, for silks, shawls, spices, dyes, drugs, and precious woóds. It's an interesting trade.'</p> 
<p>`And the profits are large?' said I.</p> 
<p>`Tremendous!' said he.</p> 
<p>I wavered again, and began to think here were greater expectations than my own.</p> 
<p>`I think I shall trade, also,' said he, putting his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets, `to the West Indies, for sugar, tobacco, and rum. Also to Ceylon, specially for elephants' tusks.'</p> 
<p>`You will want a good many ships,' said I.</p> 
<p>`A perfect fleet,' said he.</p> 
<p>Quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions, I asked him where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present?</p> 
<p>`I haven't begun insuring yet,' he replied. `I am looking about me.'</p> 
<p>Somehow, that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnard's Inn. I said (in a tone of conviction), `Ah-h!'</p> 
<p>`Yes. I am in a counting-house, and looking about me.'</p> 
<p>`Is a counting-house profitable?' I asked.</p> 
<p>`To - do you mean to the young fellow who's in it?' he asked, in reply.</p> 
<p>`Yes; to you.'</p> 
<p>`Why, n-no: not to me.' He said this with the air of one carefully reckoning up and striking a balance. `Not directly profitable. That is, it doesn't pay me anything, and I have to - keep myself.'</p> 
<p>This certainly had not a profitable appearance, and I shook my head as if I would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative capital from such a source of income.</p> 
<p>`But the thing is,' said Herbert Pocket, `that you look about you. That's the grand thing. You are in a counting-house, you know, and you look about you.'</p> 
<p>It struck me as a singular implication that you couldn't be out of a counting-house, you know, and look about you; but I silently deferred to his experience.</p> 
<p>`Then the time comes,' said Herbert, `when you see your opening. And you go in, and you swoop upon it and you make your capital, and then there you are! When you have once made your capital, you have nothing to do but employ it.'</p> 
<p>This was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden; very like. His manner of bearing his poverty, too, exactly corresponded to his manner of bearing that defeat. It seemed to me that he took all blows and buffets now, with just the same air as he had taken mine then. It was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest necessaries, for everything that I remarked upon turned out to have been sent in on my account from the coffee-house or somewhere else.</p> 
<p>Yet, having already made his fortune in his own mind, he was so unassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to him for not being puffed up. It was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways, and we got on famously. In the evening we went out for a walk in the streets, and went half-price to the Theatre; and next day we went to church at Westminster Abbey, and in the afternoon we walked in the Parks; and I wondered who shod all the horses there, and wished Joe did.</p> 
<p>On a moderate computation, it was many months, that Sunday, since I had left Joe and Biddy. The space interposed between myself and them, partook of that expansion, and our marshes were any distance off. That I could have been at our old church in my old church-going clothes, on the very last Sunday that ever was, seemed a combination of impossibilities, geographical and social, solar and lunar. Yet in the London streets, so crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the dusk of evening, there were depressing hints of reproaches for that I had put the poor old kitchen at home so far away; and in the dead of night, the footsteps of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning about Barnard's Inn, under pretence of watching it, fell hollow on my heart.</p> 
<p>On the Monday morning at a quarter before nine, Herbert went to the counting-house to report himself - to look about him, too, I suppose - and I bore him company. He was to come away in an hour or two to attend me to Hammersmith, and I was to wait about for him. It appeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers were hatched, were incubated in dust and heat, like the eggs of ostriches, judging from the places to which those incipient giants repaired on a Monday morning. Nor did the counting-house where Herbert assisted, show in my eyes as at all a good Observatory; being a back second floor up a yard, of a grimy presence in all particulars, and with a look into another back second floor, rather than a look out.</p> 
<p>I waited about until it was noon, and I went upon 'Change, and I saw fluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping, whom I took to be great merchants, though I couldn't understand why they should all be out of spirits. When Herbert came, we went and had lunch at a celebrated house which I then quite venerated, but now believe to have been the most abject superstition in Europe, and where I could not help noticing, even then, that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives and waiters' clothes, than in the steaks. This collation disposed of at a moderate price (considering the grease: which was not charged for), we went back to Barnard's Inn and got my little portmanteau, and then took coach for Hammersmith. We arrived there at two or three o'clock in the afternoon, and had very little way to walk to Mr Pocket's house. Lifting the latch of a gate, we passed direct into a little garden overlooking the river, where Mr Pocket's children were playing about. And unless I deceive myself on a point where my interests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned, I saw that Mr and Mrs Pocket's children were not growing up or being brought up, but were tumbling up.</p> 
<p>Mrs Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree, reading, with her legs upon another garden chair; and Mrs Pocket's two nursemaids were looking about them while the children played. `Mamma,' said Herbert, `this is young Mr Pip.' Upon which Mrs Pocket received me with an appearance of amiable dignity.</p> 
<p>`Master Alick and Miss Jane,' cried one of the nurses to two of the children, `if you go a bouncing up against them bushes you'll fall over into the river and be drownded, and what'll your pa say then?'</p> 
<p>At the same time this nurse picked up Mrs Pocket's handkerchief, and said, `If that don't make six times you've dropped it, Mum!' Upon which Mrs Pocket laughed and said, `Thank you, Flopson,' and settling herself in one chair only, resumed her book. Her countenance immediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if she had been reading for a week, but before she could have read half a dozen lines, she fixed her eyes upon me, and said, `I hope your mamma is quite well?' This unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that I began saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such person I had no doubt she would have been quite well and would have been very much obliged and would have sent her compliments, when the nurse came to my rescue.</p> 
<p>`Well!' she cried, picking up the pocket handkerchief, `if that don't make seven times! What ARE you a doing of this afternoon, Mum!' Mrs Pocket received her property, at first with a look of unutterable surprise as if she had never seen it before, and then with a laugh of recognition, and said, `Thank you, Flopson,' and forgot me, and went on reading.</p> 
<p>I found, now I had leisure to count them, that there were no fewer than six little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up. I had scarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard, as in the region of air, wailing dolefully.</p> 
<p>`If there ain't Baby!' said Flopson, appearing to think it most surprising. `Make haste up, Millers.'</p> 
<p>Millers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and by degrees the child's wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were a young ventriloquist with something in its mouth. Mrs Pocket read all the time, and I was curious to know what the book could be.</p> 
<p>We were waiting, I supposed, for Mr Pocket to come out to us; at any rate we waited there, and so I had an opportunity of observing the remarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed near Mrs Pocket in their play, they always tripped themselves up and tumbled over her - always very much to her momentary astonishment, and their own more enduring lamentation. I was at a loss to account for this surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind to speculations about it, until by-and-by Millers came down with the baby, which baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mrs Pocket, when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs Pocket, baby and all, and was caught by Herbert and myself.</p> 
<p>`Gracious me, Flopson!' said Mrs Pocket, looking off her book for a moment, `everybody's tumbling!'</p> 
<p>`Gracious you, indeed, Mum!' returned Flopson, very red in the face; `what have you got there?'</p> 
<p>`I got here, Flopson?' asked Mrs Pocket.</p> 
<p>`Why, if it ain't your footstool!' cried Flopson. `And if you keep it under your skirts like that, who's to help tumbling? Here!Take the baby, Mum, and give me your book.'</p> 
<p>Mrs Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant a little in her lap, while the other children played about it. This had lasted but a very short time, when Mrs Pocket issued summary orders that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap. Thus I made the second discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of the little Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down.</p> 
<p>Under these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got the children into the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Mr Pocket came out of it to make my acquaintance, I was not much surprised to find that Mr Pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression of face, and with his very grey hair disordered on his head, as if he didn't quite see his way to putting anything straight.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>这位苍白面孔的少年绅士和我面对面站着，相互暗暗思量着，竟然在这个巴纳德旅馆中相会了，两人爆发出一阵大笑。</p> 
<p>“没有想到竟然是你！”他说道。“没有想到竟然是你！”我也说道。然后，我们两人又一次相互瞧着，再次爆发出一阵大笑。“行了！”这苍白面孔的少年绅士说着，十分开心地伸出他的手，“我希望一切到此结束。上次我把你打得太狠了，只要你原谅我，你就是豁达而又大气量的人。”</p> 
<p>一听他如此说，我便肯定这位赫伯特·鄱凯特先生（这是这位苍白面孔的少年绅士的名字）到今天还是糊里糊涂，自己明明打败了还说自己狠。不过，我对他作了有礼貌的回答，两人热情地相互握手。</p> 
<p>“那个时候你还没有走红运吧？”赫伯特·鄱凯特说道。</p> 
<p>“那时还没有。”我答道。</p> 
<p>“是啊，”他赞同道，“我也听说你最近才交上好运。那时候我也指望交好运呢。”</p> 
<p>“真的吗？”</p> 
<p>“是的。郝维仙小姐那时叫我去，看她是不是能栽培我，结果她没看上我，她无论如何是看不上我的。”</p> 
<p>我想，从礼貌出发，我该对他说这真是出乎我意料之外。</p> 
<p>“识别能力太差！”赫伯特笑着说道，“然而这是事实。她本要我去试一下，如果去了而又顺利地被她看中，我想我一定是荣华富贵了；说不定早就和埃斯苔娜那个了。”</p> 
<p>“什么那个了？”我严肃地问他。</p> 
<p>我们谈话时，他正在把水果装进盘子里，因此一时分心，就没有想出该用一个什么确切的词。他一面忙着装水果，一面解释道：“那个就是下婚聘，也就是订婚、订亲，反正就这么个叫法，哪个词都一样。”</p> 
<p>“你怎么能忍受这种失望呢？”我问道。</p> 
<p>“嘿！”他说道，“我并不在乎这些。她是一只母老虎。”</p> 
<p>“郝维仙小姐？”</p> 
<p>“她也是，不过我指的是埃斯苔娜。这个姑娘对人刻薄、态度傲慢。变化无常，全都登峰造极了。郝维仙小姐收养她的目的就是为了要报复天下的男人。”</p> 
<p>“她和郝维仙小姐是什么亲戚？”</p> 
<p>“什么亲戚也不是，”他说道，“仅仅是一个养女。”</p> 
<p>“为什么要报复天下的男人？她和天下的男人有什么怨仇？”</p> 
<p>“老天！皮普先生！”他说道，“难道你真的不知道？”</p> 
<p>我说：“我真的不知道。”</p> 
<p>“噢！这可是一个动听的故事，吃饭时我给你讲讲。不过现在，请恕我冒昧，我倒要先请教你一个问题。那一天你是怎么到那里去的？”</p> 
<p>我便告诉了他前后经过，他专心地一直听我讲完，然后大笑起来，问我事后感不感到身上痛。我并没有问他痛不痛，因为我坚信他那天被打得很痛，这是千真万确的。</p> 
<p>“贾格斯先生是你的监护人，有这事吗？”他继续问道。</p> 
<p>“是这样。”</p> 
<p>“他是郝维仙小姐的代理人和律师，是她唯一信赖的人，你可晓得？”</p> 
<p>我感到他的这一个问题把我引向了难以解答的敏感区域，便毫不掩饰自己内心的亻局促不安，回答说我就是在我们两个比试的那一天在郝维仙小姐家中遇到贾格斯先生的，仅此一次，而且肯定再没见过面，只怕他也想不起来在那里曾看见过我了。</p> 
<p>“贾格斯先生非常诚恳地推荐我父亲当你的老师，为了这件事他亲自去找过我父亲。自然了，他也是从郝维仙小姐处听说我父亲的。因为我父亲和郝维仙小姐是表亲关系。不过，他们之间并不亲密，因为我父亲既不会奉承人，也不会巴结她。”</p> 
<p>赫伯特·鄱凯特是一个心怀坦白、平易近人的人，也很可爱。过去我没有见过像他这样的人，后来我也没有见过像他这样的人。他给我留下的印象非常强烈，他的每一个音容笑貌都表明他不会做出阴险卑鄙的事来。从他的仪表来看，我感到他的前途大有可为，不过同时又有什么使我想到他这一生决不会成大器、发大财。究竟为什么，我自己也说不清。我们刚刚相见，连饭还没有一起吃，我就对他形成了这个观念，自己也无法讲明其中的原因。</p> 
<p>他和以往一样，仍然面孔苍白，虽然看上去精神抖擞，意气昂扬，其实是有气无力地强撑出来的，所以他的身体并不是真正的强壮。他的面孔生得不美，但是他和蔼可亲和欣慰欢愉的表情却使他比美少年还更胜一筹。他的身段并不相称，和当年我不客气地请他吃拳头时一样，但是他的身段总是给人一种轻巧年轻的感觉。要是他穿上特拉布先生做的衣服，是不是会比我穿着更合身更漂亮，这我不能说，但是我认为，他穿那身旧衣服比起我穿这套新衣服要像样得多。</p> 
<p>他很善于言谈，我感到如果我沉默寡言，那既不像个年轻人，也是对他不敬的表现，所以我便告诉他我的故事，特别着重指出不允许打听我的恩主是谁。我又告诉他，我原来住在穷乡僻壤，是铁匠铺的学徒，历来不懂礼貌规矩，如果他发现我在什么方面出了笑话，就告诉我，我将不胜感激。</p> 
<p>“我十分愿意，”他说道，“不过我认为你不会有什么方面要我提醒的。我们今后会时常在一起，相互之间不要有隔阂，最好打破没有必要的顾虑。你是不是赞成从现在开始就直呼我的教名赫伯特？”</p> 
<p>我对他的好意表示感谢，并且说我很赞成。作为交换，我告诉他我的教名是菲利普。</p> 
<p>“我不喜欢菲利普这个名字，”他微笑着说道，“因为菲利普听起来就像拼写书里那个道貌岸然的小孩子，这个家伙懒得掉进池塘里，胖得两只眼睛都睁不开，又那么贪婪，把糕饼锁在柜子里舍不得吃，结果喂了老鼠，或者他下定决心去掏鸟窝，却被住在附近的狗熊吃了。我告诉你我喜欢叫你什么。我们彼此很和谐，你过去是打铁的，我这样说你不会在意吧？”</p> 
<p>“随你怎么说我都不在意的，”我答道，“不过我还没有弄懂你的意思。”</p> 
<p>“我平常就用汉德尔这个名字叫你怎么样？汉德尔谱过一首迷人的曲子，那曲子就叫《和谐的铁匠》。”</p> 
<p>“我非常喜欢这个名字。”</p> 
<p>“那么，亲爱的汉德尔——”他刚说完这么几个字，门就被推开了。他转身一看，说道：“晚饭来了，我请你一定要坐在桌子的首位，因为这顿饭我是托你的福。”</p> 
<p>我怎么也不愿听从他的安排，所以他只有坐在首位，我坐在他的对面。这顿晚餐规模虽说不大，却非常可口，从我的角度来看，简直就是市长老爷的宴席了。在如此独立自主的环境下吃饭很是自由自在，而且没有长辈们坐在旁边，四周又是伦敦城。这顿晚餐还有些吉卜赛人的风格，令我们的兴趣提高不少。晚餐本身要是用彭波契克先生的话来形容，那就是“极尽奢华”，是由咖啡馆全盘提供的，而我们这个起居室四周就像是牧草匾乏的地区，所以只有随机应变，因陋就简。送饭来的茶房在这种情况下也只有适应我们流浪的习惯，把整套的餐具放在地板上（弄得他走路时常常会被绊倒），把松软的黄油放在圈椅上，把面包放在书架上，把乳酪放在煤篓子里，把炖鸡放在隔壁房间里我的床上——我晚上睡觉时发现被褥上沾了不少荷兰芹和黄油冻。所有这一切都使我们的晚餐吃着非常有趣，特别是当这位送饭来的侍者不在我们身边看我们吃时，我们吃得更加愉快。</p> 
<p>我们吃了一阵，我便提醒赫伯特，他答应过在吃饭时把郝维仙小姐的事情讲给我听。</p> 
<p>“是要讲的，”他答道，“我马上便说。不过我得先谈一件事，汉德尔，从伦敦的习惯来说，是不能把餐刀放进嘴里的，以免发生意外。一般来说是用叉子把食物递到嘴里去，而且放进的位置要适当，不能太里面。当然，这都是小事，是不值得大惊小怪的，只不过别人这样做，我们也依样画葫芦罢了。还有，用汤匙时不要举得过高，要放低一些。这有两点好处，一是更易于送进嘴里，归根结底吃东西是要把东西送进嘴里的；另一个好处是右边的胳膊肘就不至于像剥牡蛎一样抬得很高。”</p> 
<p>他如此生动活泼地向我提出友好的建议，使两人都哈哈大笑起来，我也没有感到羞愧。</p> 
<p>接着他说道：“现在我就来谈谈郝维仙小姐吧。你得了解，郝维仙小姐从小就是一个娇生惯养的女孩子。她还是婴儿时母亲便离世而去，她父亲总是顺从她，要什么便给什么。她的父亲是你们那一带的乡绅，是啤酒作坊的老板。我弄不懂为什么啤酒作坊的老板就可以成为一流名人，而烤面包的就不能成为上流人物，但这却是无可争辩的。世道如此，司空见惯了。”</p> 
<p>“听说上流人物不能开酒馆，对吗？”我问道。</p> 
<p>“无论如何都不能，”赫伯特说道，“但是一家酒馆却可以接待上流人物。正是如此，郝维仙小姐是很有钱的，又很骄傲。有这样的父亲，也就有这样的女儿。”</p> 
<p>“难道郝维仙小姐是独生女吗？”我冒冒失失地问道。</p> 
<p>“不用着急，我自然会谈到。郝维仙小姐并不是唯一的孩子，她有一个同父异母的弟弟。她父亲私下又讨了个老婆，据说就是他的女厨子。”</p> 
<p>“我以为他真的那么骄傲呢。”我说道。</p> 
<p>“我的好汉德尔，他骄傲并不假，私下里娶第二个妻子，就是因为他骄傲。他们生活了一段时间后她便死了。她死了以后，我想他才把这件事告诉他的女儿，说他还有一个儿子，以后这个儿子便成为这个家庭的一个成员，也住在你很熟悉的那座房子里。在这儿子长成翩翩少年时，变成了一个胡作非为、挥霍无度、极不守本分的人，简直是一个坏蛋。最后做父亲的便剥夺了他的继承权，但是在快死时，又想开了，留给儿子一笔财产，当然远远比不上郝维仙小姐的财产多。来，再喝一杯酒。对不起，我又要来提醒你了：在社交场合，干杯不要那么过分严肃认真，可以潇洒一些，可以把酒杯碰到鼻子上来个底儿朝天。”</p> 
<p>我专心致志地听他叙述，以致注意过了头，出了差错。于是我便向他表示谢意，而且连声说抱歉。他说了声“没有关系，以后注意便行了”，接下去又说道：</p> 
<p>“郝维仙小姐成了继承人后，想来高攀的人自然川流不息，这是可想而知的。他的那位同父异母的兄弟虽然也有丰厚的财产，但经不住他的还债，以及毫无节制的挥霍，最后又成为一文不名的人了。于是，姐弟之间又有了不和，不和的程度大大超过当日他和父亲之间的不和。大家猜想他对他姐姐产生了不共戴天的仇恨，以为过去父亲之所以迁怒于他全是受她的影响。现在我就来叙述她最悲惨的情节——对不起，汉德尔，我又要打断你听故事了，注意不要把餐巾放在大玻璃酒杯里。”</p> 
<p>我为什么把餐巾弄到大玻璃酒杯中去，自己完全说不出个所以然。我只知道我费了很大的力气才把偌大的一块餐巾硬塞进有限的杯口里，完全是莫名其妙。于是，我再次感谢他好意指出，并一再表示歉意，他也以和颜悦色的态度说“没关系，没关系”，然后又继续讲下去。</p> 
<p>“接着出现了新的情况，来了一个男人，可能是在赛马场中遇上的，或许是在公共舞厅里结识的，反正随便说是哪儿遇到的都可以。这个人对郝维仙小姐大献殷勤。我没有见过此人，因为这是二十五年前发生的事，汉德尔，当时你我两人还没有来到这世界呢。我曾听我父亲说过，这个人生得挺好看，是个情场追逐的老手。如果不是无知和偏见，谁也不会错认他是个君子，因为他完全是个小人。我父亲斩钉截铁地认为他是个伪君子。我父亲有个信念：自从有人类社会以来，凡是没有君子之心的人也不会有君子之外表。我父亲认为清漆是盖不了木头的纹路的；你清漆上得愈多，木头的纹路也就愈清楚。简单地说，这个男人紧紧地追着郝维仙小姐不放，甜言蜜语地说对她忠心耿耿、爱心不变。我认为那时候她还没有对谁动过情感，但是一旦对谁动了心，那么全部真情便爆发出来，一发而不可收，也便把全部情感倾注到了他身上。无疑，她把他当成了自己的白马王子。于是他便在她身上施展手段，玩弄她的感情。他不仅从她那里骗取了许多钱，而且还引诱她花很大的价钱从她弟弟手中购进啤酒作坊的股份，其实他父亲留给他的股份是极其微小的。这个男人还编造谎言，说他不久将成为她的丈夫，应该经营那个啤酒作坊。那时，你的监护人还不是郝维仙小姐的代理人，何况她十分骄傲，又非常忠于情人，任何人的劝言都不会入耳。她的一些亲戚都是穷人，又都诡计多端，只有我父亲不是那一号人。他是穷人，但决不会随波逐流，趋炎附势，也不会得红眼病妒忌别人，在她的亲戚中是一个有独立人格的人。他告诉郝维仙小姐，她过分迁就那个男人了，受了他的控制。当然，这得罪了她，她便找到一个机会，当着这个男人的面，怒气冲冲地把我父亲从这个家庭中赶走。自那以后，我父亲就再也没有见过她。”</p> 
<p>我还记得郝维仙小姐曾经说过：“在我死后停尸在那张桌子上时，马休总还是得来看我的。”于是我问赫伯特，他父亲是不是对她恨之入骨，有不共戴天之仇恨呢？</p> 
<p>“不至于如此，”他说道，“但是她曾当着那个男人的面数落我父亲，说他是为了自己得到好处，结果却没有得到。假使我父亲再去看她，那假话便会被当真，就是我父亲本人，甚至郝维仙小姐也会认为这是真的了。闲言少叙，话归正题，把这件事说完吧。最后结婚日期定下了，结婚礼服也办好了，结婚旅行的行程也安排了，结婚典礼的宾客也邀请了，可在婚礼的那一天，就是不见新郎官，只见到他的一封信——”</p> 
<p>我急忙插言道：“她是不是正在穿结婚礼服时收到那封信的？是不是八点四十分？”</p> 
<p>“的确是八点四十分，”赫伯特点头答道，“于是她后来就让家中全部的钟表都停在八点四十分上。这封毫无情意的信一来，她的婚姻大事也便告吹，至于信中究竟还讲了些什么，恕我不能奉告，因为我也不知道。接着，她生了一场大病，病愈后她让整座宅邸荒芜，这些你都已亲眼目睹。那以后她再也没有出来见过天日。”</p> 
<p>“这是全部的经过吗？”我思考了一下问道。</p> 
<p>“我知道的就这些。其实这些事情也是我自己拼凑起来的，因为我父亲一般是不提此事的，即使那次郝维仙小姐邀我到她那里去，我父亲也只是告诉了我一点必须要了解的事，多一点也不让我知道。不过有一件事我刚才可忘了。据猜测，那个她所误信的男人其实和她那个同父异母的兄弟是沆瀣一气，秘密串通好的。他们狼狈为奸，所得好处也两人平分。”</p> 
<p>“我奇怪他怎么不和她结婚，而后再夺取她全部财产呢？”我又问道。</p> 
<p>“说不定他已经结婚了，也许这是她同父异母兄弟想出来的残酷计划，让她遗恨终身。”赫伯特说道，“我得告诉你，究竟怎么一回事我也不知道。”</p> 
<p>“那两个家伙后来怎么样了呢？”我又思考了一下这件事，问道。</p> 
<p>“他们会越陷越深，会更丢脸、更堕落，最后只有毁灭自己。”</p> 
<p>“现在他们还活着吗？”</p> 
<p>“这我可不晓得。”</p> 
<p>“你刚才说埃斯苔娜和郝维仙小姐无任何亲戚关系，只是领养的。什么时候领养的？”</p> 
<p>赫伯特耸了耸肩说道：“我知道有郝维仙小姐的那一天起就知道有了埃斯苔娜。我所知仅仅如此，汉德尔。”然后他就换了话题，说道：“现在我们两个之间已经无话不谈，关于郝维仙小姐的情况，凡是我知道的你也知道了。”</p> 
<p>“凡是我所知道的，你也都知道了。”我回了他一句。</p> 
<p>“这一点我完全相信，既然如此，在你我之间就不可能勾心斗角，也不可能纠缠不清了。如今你正在青云直上、飞黄腾达，你要遵守诺言，不去询问和讨论恩主是谁。你尽管放心，无论是我还是我家的人都决不会侵犯你的领地，也不会靠近。”</p> 
<p>他说的话真是太体面周到了，我想这样最好，即使我以后在他父亲的家里住上十年八年学习也没有人会提起此事。他说的又是那么含义深刻，我想他完全了解郝维仙小姐就是我的恩主，和我自己了解这一事实一样清楚。</p> 
<p>在此之前我没有这样想过，而他却把话头引到这个主题，其目的就是为了消除今后交往方面的障碍。现在我们已开诚布公，所以很轻松自如，交往愉快，我才明白原来如此。两人都显得很高兴很友好，我便随口问他是干什么的。他答道：“我是个资本家，是船运保险承包商。”我想他注意到我正打量房间的四周，似乎在寻找一些有关船运和资本的标志，因为他补充了一句：“那些都放在城里。”</p> 
<p>过去我有一个想法，认为城里的船运保险承包商是财大气粗不可一世的人物，所以我怀着敬畏的心情想到自己曾把一个少年保险承包商打翻在地、四脚朝天，把他具有事业心的眼睛打肿，把他负有重大责任的脑袋打破。不过，话又说回来，我同时还怀着自我宽慰的心情想到，这个赫伯特·鄱凯特不会发迹的，也不会成为财主。我不晓得自己怎么会有这种奇怪的印象。</p> 
<p>“我不会仅仅停留在对船运保险的投资中，光这样我是不满足的，我还想购进一些有利可图的人寿保险股票，并且杀进指挥部门。我还想在矿业方面干一手。除这些外，我还想包租几千吨位的船去做生意。”他将背倚在椅子上说道，“我要到东印度去，去做丝绸、披巾、香料。染料、药品以及珍贵木材方面的生意。这都是些有利可图的买卖。”</p> 
<p>“利润多吗？”我问道。</p> 
<p>“多极了！”他答道。</p> 
<p>我的思想开始波动，心想，他的前程比我的更远大。</p> 
<p>“我还想去西印度，”他把大姆指插进背心的口袋中，说道，“去那里做食糖、烟草、甜酒的生意。我还要到锡兰去做生意，特别是去做象牙生意。”</p> 
<p>“你得要有许多船。”我说道。</p> 
<p>“要一个船队。”他答道。</p> 
<p>他这宏伟的贸易计划几乎把我完全征服了，我便问他目前所保险的船只主要开往何处进行贸易。</p> 
<p>“我还没有开始保险生意呢，”他答道，“我正在观望形势。”</p> 
<p>我这才知道他一切还在筹划之中，这倒和巴纳德旅馆这种地方蛮相称的，于是我深信不疑地说道：“啊——啊！”</p> 
<p>“是这样，目前我在一家公司的会计室中工作，正在观望形势，伺机而动。”</p> 
<p>“会计室可是一个有利可图的地方？”我问道。</p> 
<p>“你是指会计室里的年轻人吗？”他没有回答却反问我道。</p> 
<p>“正是，我正是指你。”</p> 
<p>“唔，不，不，我可没有利。”他说话的神气好像在仔细核算，想尽量做到收支平衡一样，“没有直接的利益，也就是他们不付给我钱，我还必须自己养活自己。”</p> 
<p>这样看来，确实是无利可图了。于是我摇了一下头，似乎是说，这样的情况要想聚集起资本是非常困难的。</p> 
<p>赫伯特·鄱凯特说道：“问题在于你要善于观望形势，这才是最重要的事。你要懂得，身在会计室中，就可以观望形势，伺机而动。”</p> 
<p>我听他的话中有这么一种含义，似乎只有在会计室里才可以观望形势，这点我不敢苟同。当然，我只是不动声色地听着，以表示对他经验之谈的敬重。</p> 
<p>“只要时机一到，”赫伯特说道，“你面前便出现了光明大道。你只要钻进去，你只要扑上去，你就能聚起资本，那你就成了！你一旦有了资本，还愁什么，就去运用你的资本好了。”</p> 
<p>他今天的这副形象和从前我们在花园相斗时他的形象很相似，非常非常地相似。今天他忍受贫穷的态度和当年忍受我拳打脚踢的态度完全相同。依我观察，他把当年受我拳脚打击的态度搬来准备接受命运对他的打击。现在我已一目了然，他除了几件必要的最简单的用品外，真是一无所有。房中的用品，只要一问起，要么是咖啡馆为我送来的，要么是什么地方为我准备的。</p> 
<p>赫伯特在他的脑子里已经拥有了一大笔财产，却仍是那么谦虚谨慎，这种不摆架子的人格不由不使我由衷地敬佩。他本来就天生一副令人愉快的风度，谦虚不摆架子使他更加令人心舒意畅，所以我们极易相处。当晚我们便到街上去散步，又去戏院看半价戏；第二天同去西敏斯特教堂去做礼拜，下午又到几个公园去玩。我看到许多马匹，心想不知道是谁给马儿钉的掌，我多么希望是乔的杰作啊。</p> 
<p>那个星期天，即使粗粗地一算，我也觉得自从和乔及毕蒂离开以来，好像已过去了好几个月，我与他们之间的空间距离仿佛也使我们之间的时间距离扩大起来，故乡的那片沼泽地是那么遥远。然而，仅仅是上个星期，我还穿着那身旧的假日礼服去教堂做礼拜，而现在回想起来，无论从地理位置或社会地位上讲，无论用老阳历还是用老阴历来计算，都像是不可能的事。如今在伦敦的街头巷尾闲逛，那挤挤攘攘的人群，那灯火辉煌的夜晚，忽然使我感到一阵压抑，心头涌出对自己的责备之情，觉得不该把家中贫穷而破旧的厨房远远抛开。在这死气沉沉的黑夜中，一个无能的守门骗子，在巴纳德旅馆里四处闹荡，装出一副查夜的样子，噔噔的脚步声在我心中发出空荡的回声。</p> 
<p>星期一早晨八时三刻，赫伯特要到他的会计室去上班，我想，也是去观望形势、待机而动，于是陪他一同前往。他说一两个小时就离开，并和我到汉莫史密斯去，所以我就在附近等他。我觉得，星期一早晨，在伦敦四处乱窜的那些初露头角的保险业巨人们就像是从蛋里刚孵出来的一样，一出来便四处奔波，那蛋很像在热带沙漠中孵化的鸵鸟蛋。在我看来，赫伯特所在的那个会计室并不是一处良好的Liao望台，它设在一个院子后楼的三楼上，一切看上去都面目可怕、毫不起眼，与其说可以Liao望，不如说只能看一看另一幢后楼的三楼而已。</p> 
<p>我在那里一直等到中午，然后便溜达进了证券交易所。我看到一些毛发蓬松的人坐在船运证券信息牌下。我认为这些人都是了不起的商贾，不过弄不懂为什么他们全都显得没精打采。等到赫伯特来了，我们便一同去到那家有名的餐馆去吃午餐。当时我对这家餐馆特别敬重，现在才感到这家餐馆其实是整个欧洲最劣等的图有虚名的饭店。吃饭时我注意到桌布上、刀叉上和茶房衣服上的肉汁汤比牛排上的还要多。不过，里面的价格还算不贵，也许油脂没有算在其中吧。饭后回到巴纳德旅馆，我拎上那只手提箱，两人便雇了一辆马车直驶汉莫史密斯。到下午两三点钟的时候我们才到达那里，要到鄱凯特先生的家还得步行一小段路。到达后，我们打开门闩，便直接走进了一座小花园。花园面临一条河，鄱凯特先生的孩子们正在那儿玩耍。我看着他们心想，鄱凯特先生和夫人的孩子们一定不是长大的，也不是带大的，而是摔跤摔大的。我想我的这一看法不是自欺欺人的，因为这和我的利益或我个人的偏好是毫无关系的。</p> 
<p>鄱凯特夫人正在一棵树下的一张花园椅上坐着读书，两条腿搁在另外一张花园椅子上。鄱凯特夫人的两名女佣人正在照看玩耍着的孩子们。赫伯特说道：“妈妈，这就是小皮普先生。”鄱凯特夫人立刻和我打招呼，神态既和蔼可亲，又庄严认真。</p> 
<p>一个保姆对两个玩耍的孩子叫道：“阿里斯少爷，珍妮小姐，你们蹦来跳去要小心，不要被小树丛绊倒，要是滚到河里去淹死了，你爸爸会怎么怪我呢？”</p> 
<p>同时这位保姆又从地上捡起了鄱凯特夫人的手帕，说道：“夫人，这是你的手帕，掉在地上第六次了！”鄱凯特夫人笑着答道：“谢谢你，芙萝普莘。”然后把腿从另一张椅子上挪开，只坐在一张椅子上，继续读书。她的面容立刻呈现出眉头紧皱聚精会神的样子，好像她已连续读了一个星期的书一样，但是还没有看了五六行，眼光便转到了我身上，对我说道：“你妈妈一定身体挺好吧？”这一突如其来的问题使我慌成一团，只有糊里糊涂地答道，如果我还有妈妈的话，我肯定她的身体挺好，也一定十分感谢，一定会带来她的问候。正在这尴尬的时候，保姆过来才算救了我。</p> 
<p>“噢！”保姆从地上捡起这位鄱凯特夫人的手帕，大声说道，“我看这是第七次了！今天下午你怎么啦，夫人！”鄱凯特夫人接过了她的手帕，先是感到十分惊讶，好像她以前从来没有见过这东西，然后认出来了，便笑了一下，说道：“芙萝普莘，谢谢你。”说完又忘了我在那里，继续读她的书去了。</p> 
<p>现在我才有空来数一数这些孩子，发现至少有六个小鄱凯特在花园里玩，正处于各个不同的摔打时期。我还没有数清楚就听到了第七个孩子的声音，这悲伤的啼哭声仿佛是凭空而降的。</p> 
<p>“是宝宝醒了吗？”芙萝普莘表现出十分惊奇的神态，“米耐丝，你快去看看。”</p> 
<p>米耐丝是另外那位保姆，她走进了房子，马上小孩子的哭声慢慢地轻下去，以至消失了，好像那个小口技演员的嘴里给塞进了什么东西，问题就解决了。鄱凯特夫人手不离卷地读着书，我很想知道她读的是什么书。</p> 
<p>我心中暗忖，我们大概是在等待鄱凯特先生出来，不管是不是，反正我们都等在那儿，所以我也就有了机会来观察这一家中发生的有趣现象：只要孩子们乱蹦乱跳地跑到鄱凯特夫人的近处，他们就会绊倒，跌在她身上——每逢这时刻，她总是表现出惊诧，而孩子们也总是要伤心地哭上一会儿。这种情况的确使人感到很奇怪，我不得不加以思索，想得出了神，直到米耐丝抱着宝宝出来，又递给了芙萝普莘，芙萝普莘又准备把宝宝递给鄱凯特夫人，也就在这刹那之间，芙萝普莘连人带宝宝都一头向鄱凯特夫人的身上栽了过去，幸亏赫伯特和我在那里，扶住她而没有摔倒。</p> 
<p>“我的天啦，芙萝普莘！”鄱凯特夫人这才把眼光从书本上移开，说道，“怎么大家都不停地摔倒！”</p> 
<p>“天啦，你，真是的夫人！”芙萝普莘脸上惊得红起来，说道，“你在这里究竟藏着什么东西？”</p> 
<p>“芙萝普莘，你是问我这里？”鄱凯特夫人问道。</p> 
<p>“是啊，那不是你搁脚的凳子吗？”芙萝普莘说道，“你把小凳子放在你裙子下面，谁绊上能不跌跤呢？来，夫人，孩子给你，你把书给我。”</p> 
<p>鄱凯特夫人接过宝宝，把它放在自己的膝上摇晃着，动作很不娴熟，其他孩子们也都围过来玩耍。没有一会儿，鄱凯特夫人就发出命令，叫保姆把他们全都带到房中去午睡。虽然我第一次到这里来，但却又有了第二个发现，原来抚养小鄱凯特们的方法是摔跤和睡觉交替地构成的，摔跤以后便是睡觉，当然，睡觉之后又是摔跤。</p> 
<p>这时，芙萝普莘和米耐丝就像赶一群小羊一样把孩子们给弄进了屋，鄱凯特先生也从房中走出来和我见面。鄱凯特先生一副困惑的表情，头发已经灰白，乱蓬蓬的，好像从来不知该如何处理自己的问题。在这种背景下发现鄱凯特先生如此这般模样实在不算什么，不值得大惊小怪。</p>
