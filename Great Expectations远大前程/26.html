Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully in want of painting, and with dirty windows. He took out his key and opened the door, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and little used. So, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark brown rooms on the first floor. There were carved garlands on the panelled walls, and as he stood among them giving us welcome, I know what kind of loops I thought they looked like.</p> 
<p>Dinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was his dressing-room; the third, his bedroom. He told us that he held the whole house, but rarely used more of it than we saw. The table was comfortably laid - no silver in the service, of course - and at the side of his chair was a capacious dumb-waiter, with a variety of bottles and decanters on it, and four dishes of fruit for dessert. I noticed throughout, that he kept everything under his own hand, and distributed everything himself.</p> 
<p>There was a bookcase in the room; I saw, from the backs of the books, that they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography, trials, acts of parliament, and such things. The furniture was all very solid and good, like his watch-chain. It had an official look, however, and there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen. In a corner, was a little table of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he seemed to bring the office home with him in that respect too, and to wheel it out of an evening and fall to work.</p> 
<p>As he had scarcely seen my three companions until now - for, he and I had walked together - he stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell, and took a searching look at them. To my surprise, he seemed at once to be principally if not solely interested in Drummle.</p> 
<p>`Pip,' said he, putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to the window, `I don't know one from the other. Who's the Spider?'</p> 
<p>`The spider?' said I.</p> 
<p>`The blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow.'</p> 
<p>`That's Bentley Drummle,' I replied; `the one with the delicate face is Startop.'</p> 
<p>Not making the least account of `the one with the delicate face,' he returned, `Bentley Drummle is his name, is it? I like the look of that fellow.'</p> 
<p>He immediately began to talk to Drummle: not at all deterred by his replying in his heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it to screw discourse out of him. I was looking at the two, when there came between me and them, the housekeeper, with the first dish for the table.</p> 
<p>She was a woman of about forty, I supposed - but I may have thought her younger than she was. Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremely pale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair. I cannot say whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be parted as if she were panting, and her face to bear a curious expression of suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to see Macbeth at the theatre, a night or two before, and that her face looked to me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I had seen rise out of the Witches' caldron.</p> 
<p>She set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a finger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished. We took our seats at the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him, while Startop sat on the other. It was a noble dish of fish that the housekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choice mutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird. Sauces, wines, all the accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by our host from his dumb-waiter; and when they had made the circuit of the table, he always put them back again. Similarly, he dealt us clean plates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those just disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair. No other attendant than the housekeeper appeared. She set on every dish; and I always saw in her face, a face rising out of the caldron. Years afterwards, I made a dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no other natural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair, to pass behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room.</p> 
<p>Induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her own striking appearance and by Wemmick's preparation, I observed that whenever she was in the room, she kept her eyes attentively on my guardian, and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put before him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her back, and wanted him to speak when she was nigh, if he had anything to say. I fancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this, and a purpose of always holding her in suspense.</p> 
<p>Dinner went off gaily, and, although my guardian seemed to follow rather than originate subjects, I knew that he wrenched the weakest part of our dispositions out of us. For myself, I found that I was expressing my tendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronize Herbert, and to boast of my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened my lips. It was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: the development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious way at the rest, was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off.</p> 
<p>It was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that our conversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was rallied for coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his. Drummle upon this, informed our host that he much preferred our room to our company, and that as to skill he was more than our master, and that as to strength he could scatter us like chaff. By some invisible agency, my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity about this trifle; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show how muscular it was, and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in a ridiculous manner.</p> 
<p>Now, the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian, taking no heed of her, but with the side of his face turned from her, was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and showing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable. Suddenly, he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper's, like a trap, as she stretched it across the table. So suddenly and smartly did he do this, that we all stopped in our foolish contention.</p> 
<p>`If you talk of strength,' said Mr Jaggers, `I'll show you a wrist. Molly, let them see your wrist.'</p> 
<p>Her entrapped hand was on the table, but she had already put her other hand behind her waist. `Master,' she said, in a low voice, with her eyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him. `Don't.'</p> 
<p>`I'll show you a wrist,' repeated Mr Jaggers, with an immovable determination to show it. `Molly, let them see your wrist.'</p> 
<p>`Master,' she again murmured. `Please!'</p> 
<p>`Molly,' said Mr Jaggers, not looking at her, but obstinately looking at the opposite side of the room, `let them see both your wrists. Show them. Come!'</p> 
<p>He took his hand from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table. She brought her other hand from behind her, and held the two out side by side. The last wrist was much disfigured - deeply scarred and scarred across and across. When she held her hands out, she took her eyes from Mr Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us in succession.</p> 
<p>`There's power here,' said Mr Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinews with his forefinger. `Very few men have the power of wrist that this woman has. It's remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these hands. I have had occasion to notice many hands; but I never saw stronger in that respect, man's or woman's, than these.'</p> 
<p>While he said these words in a leisurely critical style, she continued to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat. The moment he ceased, she looked at him again. `That'll do, Molly,' said Mr Jaggers, giving her a slight nod; `you have been admired, and can go.' She withdrew her hands and went out of the room, and Mr Jaggers, putting the decanters on from his dumbwaiter, filled his glass and passed round the wine.</p> 
<p>`At half-past nine, gentlemen,' said he, `we must break up. Pray make the best use of your time. I am glad to see you all. Mr Drummle, I drink to you.'</p> 
<p>If his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still more, it perfectly succeeded. In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed his morose depreciation of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree until he became downright intolerable. Through all his stages, Mr Jaggers followed him with the same strange interest. He actually seemed to serve as a zest to Mr Jaggers's wine.</p> 
<p>In our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink, and I know we talked too much. we became particularly hot upon some boorish sneer of Drummle's, to the effect that we were too free with our money. It led to my remarking, with more zeal than discretion, that it came with a bad grace from him, to whom Startop had lent money in my presence but a week or so before.</p> 
<p>`Well,' retorted Drummle; `he'll be paid.'</p> 
<p>`I don't mean to imply that he won't,' said I, `but it might make you hold your tongue about us and our money, I should think.'</p> 
<p>`You should think!' retorted Drummle. `Oh Lord!'</p> 
<p>'I dare say,' I went on, meaning to be very severe, `that you wouldn't lend money to any of us, if we wanted it.'</p> 
<p>`You are right,' said Drummle. `I wouldn't lend one of you a sixpence. I wouldn't lend anybody a sixpence.'</p> 
<p>`Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say.'</p> 
<p>`You should say,' repeated Drummle. `Oh Lord!'</p> 
<p>This was so very aggravating - the more especially as I found myself making no way against his surly obtuseness - that I said, disregarding Herbert's efforts to check me:</p> 
<p>`Come, Mr Drummle, since we are on the subject, I'll tell you what passed between Herbert here and me, when you borrowed that money.'</p> 
<p>`I don't want to know what passed between Herbert there and you,' growled Drummle. And I think he added in a lower growl, that we might both go to the devil and shake ourselves.</p> 
<p>`I'll tell you, however,' said I, `whether you want to know or not. We said that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it, you seemed to be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it.'</p> 
<p>Drummle laughed outright, and sat laughing in our faces, with his hands in his pockets and his round shoulders raised: plainly signifying that it was quite true, and that he despised us, as asses all.</p> 
<p>Hereupon Startop took him in hand, though with a much better grace than I had shown, and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable. Startop, being a lively bright young fellow, and Drummle being the exact opposite, the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct personal affront. He now retorted in a coarse lumpish way, and Startop tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made us all laugh. Resenting this little success more than anything, Drummle, without any threat or warning, pulled his hands out of his pockets, dropped his round shoulders, swore, took up a large glass, and would have flung it at his adversary's head, but for our entertainer's dexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that purpose.</p> 
<p>`Gentlemen,' said Mr Jaggers, deliberately putting down the glass, and hauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain, `I am exceedingly sorry to announce that it's half-past nine.'</p> 
<p>On this hint we all rose to depart. Before we got to the street door, Startop was cheerily calling Drummle `old boy,' as if nothing had happened. But the old boy was so far from responding, that he would not even walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way; so, Herbert and I, who remained in town, saw them going down the street on opposite sides; Startop leading, and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the houses, much as he was wont to follow in his boat.</p> 
<p>As the door was not yet shut, I thought I would leave Herbert there for a moment, and run up-stairs again to say a word to my guardian. I found him in his dressing-room surrounded by his stock of boots, already hard at it, washing his hands of us.</p> 
<p>I told him I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anything disagreeable should have occurred, and that I hoped he would not blame me much.</p> 
<p>`Pooh!' said he, sluicing his face, and speaking through the water-drops; `it's nothing, Pip. I like that Spider though.'</p> 
<p>He had turned towards me now, and was shaking his head, and blowing, and towelling himself.</p> 
<p>`I am glad you like him, sir,' said I - `but I don't.'</p> 
<p>`No, no,' my guardian assented; `don't have too much to do with him. Keep as clear of him as you can. But I like the fellow, Pip; he is one of the true sort. Why, if I was a fortune-teller--'</p> 
<p>Looking out of the towel, he caught my eye.</p> 
<p>`But I am not a fortune-teller,' he said, letting his head drop into a festoon of towel, and towelling away at his two ears. `You know what I am, don't you? Good-night, Pip.'</p> 
<p>`Good-night, sir.'</p> 
<p>In about a month after that, the Spider's time with Mr Pocket was up for good, and, to the great relief of all the house but Mrs Pocket, he went home to the family hole.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>结果发生的事情和温米克告诉我的一样，我很快便得了一个机会来把我监护人的家和他的管帐办事员的家作一个比较，因为他约请我到他家中做客。我从伍尔华斯到达事务所的时候，我的监护人正在他的房间中用香皂洗手。他见到我便把我叫到面前，告诉我他约请我和几位我的朋友到他家做客，和温米克昨天提到过的一模一样。他和我约定，“不需要客气，不需要穿晚宴礼服，日期就定在明天。”我问他我们该到哪里去，因为我委实不知道他府上的地址。他告诉我，“你们到这里来，然后我带你们上我家去。”看来，他总是不愿说那些像似招供的话。趁这个机会来说说贾格斯先生的洗手，他就像一个外科医生或牙科医生，每打发走一位当事人就得洗一次手。他房间中有一个小盥洗室，专门为他洗手而造，里面发出的香皂味简直可以和一家香料铺子里的香气相媲美。在盥洗室有一根滚轴，上面有一条旋转式长毛巾，他习惯洗过手后用这条毛巾擦净擦干。每次从违警罪法庭上回来，或送走一个当事人之后，他首先的任务是洗手。</p> 
<p>第二天六点钟，我和几位朋友来到这里。他好像刚刚办完了一件比通常更加肮脏不堪的案件，所以一头钻在小盥洗室内，不仅仅在洗手，而且又是洗脸，又是漱口、情喉。等到这一切都做完后，他又用那块大毛巾擦干，然后掏出铅笔刀来剔指甲缝里的尘灰污垢，最后才穿上外衣。</p> 
<p>我们一走出事务所来到街上，就看到像往常一样有一些贼头贼脑的人在那儿走来走去。很显然，他们都极其渴望和他谈事情，可是他身上的那股香皂味就好像光环一样，使他们知道这天不得不放弃找他谈事的希望。我们向西走着，他不时地被街上人群中的某个人认出来，只要一发生这类事，他便扯大嗓门和我说话。他从不表示他认出了谁，对那些已经认出了他的人也根本不加理睬。</p> 
<p>他领我们来到伦敦索霍区的吉拉德街，街的南面有一所宅邸，从外表上看十分宏伟，但是外面的油漆业已剥落，窗户上布满了灰尘，呈现出一片凄凉情境。他掏钥匙打开大门，我们全都走进一间石砌的大厅，里面空荡一片，阴森可怖，几乎没有使用过。我们登上了深褐色的楼梯，上了二楼，这里有一套三间深褐色的房间，四面墙壁都有嵌板，嵌板上都按刻着花纹。他站在一圈一圈的花纹中对我们表示欢迎，我心里明白这些圈圈很像绞架上的那一种圈圈。</p> 
<p>晚餐陈设在最好的一个房间中；第二个房间是他的盥洗室；第三间是他的卧房。他告诉我们，他虽拥有这一座大房子，但是所用的就这几间。餐桌上的菜安排得很令人称心，没有银器餐具，这是早知道的事。他座椅旁边有一个宏伟阔气的回转式食品架，上面放有各种酒类，以及餐后用的四盘水果。我注意到他总是把每一件东西放在手边，并且亲自动手为大家分配。</p> 
<p>房间里放着一个书橱，摆满了书，从书脊一看就知道都是些关于证据、刑法、罪犯传记、犯罪案例、法令之类的书。家具都是上好材料造成的，坚固耐用，就和他的表链一样。一看就知道哪件家具是做什么用的，所以没有一件家具只是摆设性的。在墙角边有一张小小的文件桌，上面有一盏带灯罩的灯，可见他似乎总要带一些公事回家干，把家庭也变成事务所，晚上把文件桌推出来就可以工作。</p> 
<p>在这之前，贾格斯先生一直没有注意我的三个朋友，因为在路上时他总是和我走在一起。这时，他站在炉边地毯上，先打铃叫他的女仆，然后便仔细地打量着他们。他立刻对德鲁莫尔发生了兴趣，如果不是唯一对他发生了兴趣，也是主要对他发生了兴趣，这倒使我感到奇怪。</p> 
<p>“皮普，”他说道，把他的大手搭在我肩上，推我走到窗口，“我对这几个人还分不清谁是谁。蜘蛛是哪一个？”</p> 
<p>“蜘蛛？”我问道。</p> 
<p>“就是那个脸上生着疙瘩、叉手叉脚、沉闷不悦的家伙。”</p> 
<p>“他是本特莱·德鲁莫尔，”我答道，“那个眉目生得俊俏的是斯塔特鲁。”</p> 
<p>他对于眉目生得俊俏的一位根本没有留意，说道：“他就叫本特莱·德鲁莫尔，是吗？我倒挺喜欢他这个长相。”</p> 
<p>他马上便开始和德鲁莫尔攀谈起来。虽然德鲁莫尔的答话既沉闷又迟钝，拖泥带水，但这都阻止不了贾格斯的兴趣，总是设法从他那儿逼出话来。我正站在那里看着他们俩，管家妇走到我们中间，为我们的餐桌送来了第一道菜。</p> 
<p>我猜测她大约四十岁光景，不过我想她的长相可能比实际年龄更年轻些。她身材修长，形体柔软轻盈，面容十分苍白，一双大眼睛黯淡失神，浓密的长发披过双肩。她的两片嘴唇张开，仿佛在喘着气，我不知道是不是由于患心脏病的原因。还有，她的脸上有一种古怪的表情，好像心绪不宁。我记得一两天之前的晚上我曾到戏院观看莎士比亚的《麦克白斯》，剧中从女巫的大锅子中冒出来的那些被热气熏得走了形的面孔倒活像这位管家妇的面孔。</p> 
<p>管家妇把菜肴放在餐桌上，用一个手指迅速地触了一下我监护人的胳膊，示意他餐桌业已摆好，然后便飘然而去。我们围着圆桌分宾主落座，我的监护人让德鲁莫尔坐在他的旁边，另一边坐的是斯塔特普。管家妇送来的第一道菜是美味可口的鱼，另一道菜是同样精致味鲜的羊肉，再下面一道菜是毫不逊色的野禽。酱油、酒、各种调味品，凡是需要的一切佐料全都是精品，也全都是由我们的东道主从回转式食品架上取下为我们分发的。这些东西依次分发之后，他总要把它们放回原处。我们每吃一道菜，他都要给我们分发一次干净的杯盘刀叉，把用过的餐具丢进他座椅旁边的两个篓子中。除了那位管家妇，再没有见到其他的佣人。她为我们上每一道菜，每次我看到她的面孔，总觉得像一副从女巫的大锅子中蒸出来的面孔。许多年之后，在一间黑暗的屋子里，我曾用一碗酒精燃烧出的光亮照过一张脸，和这女人的面孔极其相像，而且像得可怕。其实，除了飘垂的头发外，别的地方都并不相像。</p> 
<p>我特别注意这位管家婆，一个原因是她的面容具有明显的吸引力，另一个原因是因为温米克曾提醒过这件事。我注意到每一次她走进房来，总是两眼紧紧地盯着我的监护人，她把菜肴放在他面前，想放开手，又迟疑不放，仿佛担心他会叫她把菜再端回去，似乎表示如果他有什么话要说，那么趁她在这儿的时候就对她说。我又观察我监护人的态度，发觉他完全意识到这一情况，不过是故意地让她感到进退两难而已。</p> 
<p>晚餐进行得非常愉快。虽然我的监护人似乎总是人云亦云，不大主动触及某些问题，我知道他其实正在专心留意我们每个人在性格上的致命弱点。就拿我自己来说吧，我两片嘴唇一分开，话就没完，表明了我追求荣华富贵、挥金如土的倾向，而且自以为是赫伯特的恩主，处处夸耀自己的远大前程。我们几个人个个如此，特别是德鲁莫尔，没有一个人比他更快地暴露出自己的劣根性。第一道鱼还没有吃完时，他那种善妒好疑、冷嘲热讽的倾向已经被逼了出来，原形毕露。</p> 
<p>没有多久我们就开始吃乳酪，谈话的主题涉及到了我们不断增长的划船本领。我们开始一致攻击德鲁莫尔，说他就像一头慢吞吞的两栖动物，晚上划船时总是跟在我们后面。德鲁莫尔不甘落后，对我们的东道主说他就是喜欢和我们相隔一段距离，因为在划船的技巧方面连我们的师傅也比不上他，至于力气，我们不过是糠批而已，一下子便可把我们给筛出去了。我的监护人有一种无形的力量，把他逗得发起火来，甚至准备要比试一下。他把袖口挽起，露出胳膊，夸示他的肌肉多发达，于是我们大家也都挽起袖口，露出胳膊，这种举动简直滑稽可笑。</p> 
<p>这时，正巧管家妇走来收拾桌上的杯盘残羹，我的监护人根本对她没有注意，面孔背着她，只顾靠在座椅上，咬着他的食指指背，表示出对德鲁莫尔的极大兴趣。说实在的，对他的神情我完全不能理解。这时，管家妇正把手伸向桌面，说时迟，那时快，他啪的一声把他的大手打在她的手上，就像老鼠夹夹住了老鼠一样。这一记来得如此突如其来，又如此闪电迅速，使我们愚蠢的争论立时结束。</p> 
<p>“讲气力嘛，”贾格斯先生说道，“我让你们见见世面。茉莉，让大家见识一下你的手腕。”</p> 
<p>她那只被抓住的手正被按在桌上，但是她的另一只手已经放到背后去了。“老爷，”她用低低的声音说着，两只眼睛恳求地盯望着贾格斯先生，“不要这样。”</p> 
<p>“我要让你们看一下这只手腕。”贾格斯先生又说了一遍，毫不为她所动，铁石心肠地要让别人看她的手腕，“茉莉，让大家欣赏一下你的手腕。”</p> 
<p>“老爷，”她又低低地说道，“那就请大家看吧！”</p> 
<p>“茉莉，”贾格斯先生根本没望着她，只是一味地看着房子的另一边，说道，“让大家欣赏一下你的两只手腕。来，拿给他们看。”</p> 
<p>他先松开手，然后把她的手腕翻过来，放在桌上。她把另一只手从背后伸过来，两只手并排地放在桌上。第二只手相当难看，有深深的伤疤，一道道重叠在一起。在她把手伸出来时，她就不再看贾格斯先生，却转动着眼睛，警惕地顺序看了一下所有其他的人。</p> 
<p>“力气就在这里，”贾格斯先生说道，冷冷地用食指指着手腕上的肌肉，“绝大部分男人的手腕也比不上她手腕的力气。只要看这双手抓起人来，那就是惊人的了不起。我见识过的手算是多的了，可是，无论是男人还是女人，我还没有见过一双像这双手有力气。”</p> 
<p>贾格斯先生用悠闲的批评家的风度说着这番话，而她仍然一个个地打量着坐在这里的我们。他的话一说完，她的目光又转向他。“茉莉，这就可以了，”贾格斯对她微微一点头说道，“大家都欣赏了你的手腕，你可以走了。”于是她撤回双手，离开了这个房间。这时，贾格斯先生从回转食品架上取出有圆玻璃塞子的酒瓶，先将自己的杯子斟满，然后挨个为大家斟酒。</p> 
<p>“诸位先生，”他说道，“九点半我们一定要结束，请大家珍视这宝贵的时光。今天能见到大家我是非常快慰的，德鲁莫尔先生，我来敬你一杯。”</p> 
<p>贾格斯先生专门为德鲁莫尔敬酒的目的如果是为了诱出他的人性弱点，那做得是很成功的。德鲁莫尔那副紧绷着面孔自以为是的神态，显然是对其余人的藐视，而且越来越无札，最后达到无法容忍的地步。他人性大暴露的过程，都被贾格斯先生津津有味地看在眼里。德鲁莫尔似乎成了贾格斯先生的佐酒极品。</p> 
<p>我们是孩子，不免有孩子气，缺乏谨慎自重，我心里有数，大家酒喝多了，话也就多了起来。我们易干动怒，对德鲁莫尔的讽刺忍受不了，因为他指责我们花钱太大方。于是，我们火气上冒，顾不了谨慎从事，以怒对怒，也指责他不要自以为是，因为就在一个星期之前，他还当着我的面向斯塔特普借过钱呢。</p> 
<p>“是有这件事，”德鲁莫尔顶嘴道，“我自然会还给他的。”</p> 
<p>“我并不是说你还不还，”我说道，“我是想要你闭上嘴巴，我们怎样花钱和你无关，用不着你来管。”</p> 
<p>“你是想！”德鲁莫尔又反驳道，“噢，我的天啦！”</p> 
<p>“我敢打赌，”我继续说道，语气十分严厉，“要是我们缺钱用，我看你是不会借钱给我们的。”</p> 
<p>“你说得对，”德鲁莫尔说道，“你们从我这儿是借不到一个铜子儿，谁也不要想从我这里借到一个铜子儿。”</p> 
<p>“我说，在这种情况下向别人借钱可太卑鄙了。”</p> 
<p>“你说！”德鲁莫尔重复道，“噢，我的天啦！”</p> 
<p>局势越来越恶化，此人的感觉那么迟钝顽固，我对他简直无能为力，尽管赫伯特一再劝我消气，可我还是无可再忍地说道：</p> 
<p>“得了，德鲁莫尔先生，既然扯上这件事，我倒要告诉你，你借钱的时候，赫伯特和我是怎么说的。”</p> 
<p>“我根本就不想知道赫伯特和你是怎么说的。”德鲁莫尔愤愤地说。我记得他还低低地骂了些什么，说我们该下地狱等等。</p> 
<p>“无论如何我得告诉你，”我说道，“无论你想不想知道我也得说。当时你非常高兴地把借来的钱塞进口袋中，我们说你似乎心里在想，这个人竟如此软弱，反而借钱给你，你心里感到很好笑。”</p> 
<p>德鲁莫尔听后大笑，坐在那里当面嘲笑着我们，两只手插在裤袋中，圆滚滚的肩膀耸得高高的。很明显，我们讲的是事实，他把我们都当成驴子一样笨而轻视我们。</p> 
<p>这时，斯塔特普也看不下去，不能袖手旁观了，不过他的语言比起我的来要文雅得多，他尽力地劝告对方说话要客气一些。斯塔特普是一位生性活泼、聪明机灵的年轻人，而德鲁莫尔正和他相反，因此一直把斯塔特普怀恨在心，当成最有威胁的肉中刺眼中钉。他用粗俗迟钝的语言讥笑斯塔特普，而斯塔特普却用些有趣的语言企图把争吵岔开，逗得我们都笑了起来。德鲁莫尔对他这次大显身手并获得空前的成功更加大为不满，事先没有恫吓，也不警告，就慢慢地把手从口袋中掏出来，放下耸起的圆乎乎的肩头，然后大骂一声，拿起一只玻璃酒杯，就要向他对头的头上砸去。幸亏我们的东道主手快眼尖，霎时间抓住了杯子，没有让他摔过去。</p> 
<p>贾格斯先生慢条斯理地把酒杯放下，然后拉出他那块有粗金锭的自鸣弹簧金表，对我们说道：“先生们，十分遗憾，我不得不告诉大家，现在是九点半了。”</p> 
<p>一听到贾格斯先生的提示，我们都起身告辞了。还没有走出临街的大门，斯塔特普便快乐地称呼德鲁莫尔为“老兄”了，仿佛什么事都没有发生似的，可是这位老兄却根本不理他，甚至也不愿意和他一道回汉莫史密斯。赫伯特和我留在城里过夜。只见他们两人各自走在马路的一边，斯塔特普稍前一点，德鲁莫尔稍后一点，而且慢吞吞地走在屋檐的阴影中，和他跟在我们后面划船时的情况一模一样。</p> 
<p>贾格斯先生的大门还没有关，我要赫伯特稍等一会儿，因为我想上楼去和我的监护人讲几句话。我看到他正在盥洗室中洗着手，旁边放着他各式各样的靴子。他正在拼命地擦手，要把我们留下来的气味全部擦干净。</p> 
<p>我告诉他，我跑上楼来是为了向他道歉，因为刚才发生了实在令人不愉快的事情，希望他不要更多地责备我。</p> 
<p>“呸！”他一面冲洗他的面孔，一面透过水珠对我说，“没有事，皮普。不管怎样，我还是喜欢那只蜘蛛。”</p> 
<p>他把脸转过来对着我，摇着头，又是扶鼻子，又是用毛巾擦脸。</p> 
<p>“先生，你喜欢他我很高兴，”我说道，“不过我可不喜欢他。”</p> 
<p>“你说得对，对，”我的监护人同意我道，“不要和他多讲什么，和他保持一定距离。不过，皮普，我倒是喜欢他，他属于实心眼儿的人，唉，要是我能算命的话——”</p> 
<p>他把眼睛从毛巾中露出来，正好和我的眼睛对视了一下。</p> 
<p>“但我不是算命的，”他说道，又把大花彩般的毛巾捂在面孔上，擦着两边的耳朵。“你晓得我是干哪一行的，是吗？那么再见，皮普。”</p> 
<p>“先生，再见。”</p> 
<p>大约一个月以后，蜘蛛和鄱凯特先生的租约到期，便搬回到自己老家的蜘蛛洞中去住了。除了鄱凯特夫人，我们大家都感到解除了一大忧患。</p>
