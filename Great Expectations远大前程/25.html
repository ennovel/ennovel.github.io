I presented him with a half-share in my boat, which was the occasion of his often coming down to Hammersmith; and my possession of a halfshare in his chambers often took me up to London. We used to walk between the two places at all hours. I have an affection for the road yet (though it is not so pleasant a road as it was then), formed in the impressibility of untried youth and hope.</p> 
<p>When I had been in Mr Pocket's family a month or two, Mr and Mrs Camilla turned up. Camilla was Mr Pocket's sister. Georgiana, whom I had seen at Miss Havisham's on the same occasion, also turned up. she was a cousin - an indigestive single woman, who called her rigidity religion, and her liver love. These people hated me with the hatred of cupidity and disappointment. As a matter of course, they fawned upon me in my prosperity with the basest meanness. Towards Mr Pocket, as a grown-up infant with no notion of his own interests, they showed the complacent forbearance I had heard them express. Mrs Pocket they held in contempt; but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily disappointed in life, because that shed a feeble reflected light upon themselves.</p> 
<p>These were the surroundings among which I settled down, and applied myself to my education. I soon contracted expensive habits, and began to spend an amount of money that within a few short months I should have thought almost fabulous; but through good and evil I stuck to my books. There was no other merit in this, than my having sense enough to feel my deficiencies. Between Mr Pocket and Herbert I got on fast; and, with one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start I wanted, and clear obstructions out of my road, I must have been as great a dolt as Drummle if I had done less.</p> 
<p>I had not seen Mr Wemmick for some weeks, when I thought I would write him a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening. He replied that it would give him much pleasure, and that he would expect me at the office at six o'clock. Thither I went, and there I found him, putting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck.</p> 
<p>`Did you think of walking down to Walworth?' said he.</p> 
<p>`Certainly,' said I, `if you approve.'</p> 
<p>`Very much,' was Wemmick's reply, `for I have had my legs under the desk all day, and shall be glad to stretch them. Now, I'll tell you what I have got for supper, Mr Pip. I have got a stewed steak - which is of home preparation - and a cold roast fowl - which is from the cook's-shop. I think it's tender, because the master of the shop was a Juryman in some cases of ours the other day, and we let him down easy. I reminded him of it when I bought the fowl, and I said, "Pick us out a good one, old Briton, because if we had chosen to keep you in the box another day or two, we could easily have done it." He said to that, "Let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop." I let him, of course. As far as it goes, it's property and portable. You don't object to an aged parent, I hope?'</p> 
<p>I really thought he was still speaking of the fowl, until he added, `Because I have got an aged parent at my place.' I then said what politeness required.</p> 
<p>`So, you haven't dined with Mr Jaggers yet?' he pursued, as we walked along.</p> 
<p>`Not yet.'</p> 
<p>`He told me so this afternoon when he heard you were coming. I expect you'll have an invitation to-morrow. He's going to ask your pals, too. Three of 'em; ain't there?'</p> 
<p>Although I was not in the habit of counting Drummle as one of my intimate associates, I answered, `Yes.'</p> 
<p>`Well, he's going to ask the whole gang;' I hardly felt complimented by the word; `and whatever he gives you, he'll give you good. Don't look forward to variety, but you'll have excellence. And there'sa nother rum thing in his house,' proceeded Wemmick, after a moment's pause, as if the remark followed on the housekeeper understood; `he never lets a door or window be fastened at night.'</p> 
<p>`Is he never robbed?'</p> 
<p>`That's it!' returned Wemmick. `He says, and gives it out publicly, "I want to see the man who'll rob me." Lord bless you, I have heard him, a hundred times if I have heard him once, say to regular cracksmen in our front office, "You know where I live; now, no bolt is ever drawn there; why don't you do a stroke of business with me? Come; can't I tempt you?" Not a man of them, sir, would be bold enough to try it on, for love or money.'</p> 
<p>`They dread him so much?' said I.</p> 
<p>`Dread him,' said Wemmick. `I believe you they dread him. Not but what he's artful, even in his defiance of them. No silver, sir. Britannia metal, every spoon.'</p> 
<p>`So they wouldn't have much,' I observed, `even if they--'</p> 
<p>`Ah! But he would have much,' said Wemmick, cutting me short, `and they know it. He'd have their lives, and the lives of scores of 'em. He'd have all he could get. And it's impossible to say what he couldn't get, if he gave his mind to it.'</p> 
<p>I was falling into meditation on my guardian's greatness, when Wemmick remarked:</p> 
<p>`As to the absence of plate, that's only his natural depth, you know. A river's its natural depth, and he's his natural depth. Look at his watch-chain. That's real enough.'</p> 
<p>`It's very massive,' said I.</p> 
<p>`Massive?' repeated Wemmick. `I think so. And his watch is a gold repeater, and worth a hundred pound if it's worth a penny. Mr Pip, there are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about that watch; there's not a man, a woman, or a child, among them, who wouldn't identify the smallest link in that chain, and drop it as if it was red-hot, if inveigled into touching it.'</p> 
<p>At first with such discourse, and afterwards with conversation of a more general nature, did Mr Wemmick and I beguile the time and the road, until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of Walworth.</p> 
<p>It appeared to be a collection of back lanes, ditches, and little gardens, and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement. Wemmick's house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of garden, and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery mounted with guns.</p> 
<p>`My own doing,' said Wemmick. `Looks pretty; don't it?'</p> 
<p>I highly commended it, I think it was the smallest house I ever saw; with the queerest gothic windows (by far the greater part of them sham), and a gothic door, almost too small to get in at.</p> 
<p>`That's a real flagstaff, you see,' said Wemmick, `and on Sundays I run up a real flag. Then look here. After I have crossed this bridge, I hoist it up - so - and cut off the communication.'</p> 
<p>The bridge was a plank, and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide and two deep. But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he hoisted it up and made it fast; smiling as he did so, with a relish and not merely mechanically.</p> 
<p>`At nine o'clock every night, Greenwich time,' said Wemmick, `the gun fires. There he is, you see! And when you hear him go, I think you'll say he's a Stinger.'</p> 
<p>The piece of ordnance referred to, was mounted in a separate fortress, constructed of lattice-work. It was protected from the weather by an ingenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella.</p> 
<p>`Then, at the back,' said Wemmick, `out of sight, so as not to impede the idea of fortifications - for it's a principle with me, if you have an idea, carry it out and keep it up - I don't know whether that's your opinion--'</p> 
<p>I said, decidedly.</p> 
<p>` - At the back, there's a pig, and there are fowls and rabbits; then, I knock together my own little frame, you see, and grow cucumbers; and you'll judge at supper what sort of a salad I can raise. So, sir,' said Wemmick, smiling again, but seriously too, as he shook his head, `if you can suppose the little place besieged, it would hold out a devil of a time in point of provisions.'</p> 
<p>Then, he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off, but which was approached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long time to get at; and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth. Our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake, on whose margin the bower was raised. This piece of water (with an island in the middle which might have been the salad for supper) was of a circular form, and he had constructed a fountain in it, which, when you set a little mill going and took a cork out of a pipe, played to that powerful extent that it made the back of your hand quite wet.</p> 
<p>`I am my own engineer, and my own carpenter, and my own plumber, and my own gardener, and my own Jack of all Trades,' said Wemmick, in acknowledging my compliments. `Well; it's a good thing, you know. It brushes the Newgate cobwebs away, and pleases the Aged. You wouldn't mind being at once introduced to the Aged, would you? It wouldn't put you out?'</p> 
<p>I expressed the readiness I felt, and we went into the castle. There, we found, sitting by a fire, a very old man in a flannel coat: clean, cheerful, comfortable, and well cared for, but intensely deaf.</p> 
<p>`Well aged parent,' said Wemmick, shaking hands with him in a cordial and jocose way, `how am you?'</p> 
<p>`All right, John; all right!' replied the old man.</p> 
<p>`Here's Mr Pip, aged parent,' said Wemmick, `and I wish you could hear his name. Nod away at him, Mr Pip; that's what he likes. Nod away at him, if you please, like winking!'</p> 
<p>`This is a fine place of my son's, sir,' cried the old man, while I nodded as hard as I possibly could. `This is a pretty pleasureground, sir. This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept together by the Nation, after my son's time, for the people's enjoyment.'</p> 
<p>`You're as proud of it as Punch; ain't you, Aged?' said Wemmick, contemplating the old man, with his hard face really softened; `there's a nod for you;' giving him a tremendous one; `there's another for you;' giving him a still more tremendous one; `you like that, don't you? If you're not tired, Mr Pip - though I know it's tiring to strangers - will you tip him one more? You can't think how it pleases him.'</p> 
<p>I tipped him several more, and he was in great spirits. We left him bestirring himself to feed the fowls, and we sat down to our punch in the arbour; where Wemmick told me as he smoked a pipe that it had taken him a good many years to bring the property up to its present pitch of perfection.</p> 
<p>`Is it your own, Mr Wemmick?'</p> 
<p>`O yes,' said Wemmick, `I have got hold of it, a bit at a time. It's a freehold, by George!'</p> 
<p>`Is it, indeed? I hope Mr Jaggers admires it?'</p> 
<p>`Never seen it,' said Wemmick. `Never heard of it. Never seen the Aged. Never heard of him. No; the office is one thing, and private life is another. When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me, and when I come into the Castle, I leave the office behind me. If it's not in any way disagreeable to you, you'll oblige me by doing the same. I don't wish it professionally spoken about.'</p> 
<p>Of course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of his request. The punch being very nice, we sat there drinking it and talking, until it was almost nine o'clock. `Getting near gun-fire,' said Wemmick then, as he laid down his pipe; `it's the Aged's treat.'</p> 
<p>Proceeding into the Castle again, we found the Aged heating the poker, with expectant eyes, as a preliminary to the performance of this great nightly ceremony. Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand, until the moment was come for him to take the red-hot poker from the Aged, and repair of the battery. He took it, and went out, and presently the Stinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a cottage as if it must fall to pieces, and made every glass and teacup in it ring. Upon this, the Aged - who I believe would have been blown out of his arm-chair but for holding on by the elbows - cried out exultingly, `He's fired! I heerd him!' and I nodded at the old gentleman until it is no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him.</p> 
<p>The interval between that time and supper, Wemmick devoted to showing me his collection of curiosities. They were mostly of a felonious character; comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been committed, a distinguished razor or two, some locks of hair, and several manuscript confessions written under condemnation - upon which Mr Wemmick set particular value as being, to use his own words, `every one of 'em Lies, sir.' These were agreeably dispersed among small specimens of china and glass, various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the museum, and some tobacco-stoppers carved by the Aged. They were all displayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I had been first inducted, and which served, not only as the general sitting-room but as the kitchen too, if I might judge from a saucepan on the hob, and a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the suspension of a roasting-jack.</p> 
<p>There was a neat little girl in attendance, who looked after the Aged in the day. When she had laid the supper-cloth, the bridge was lowered to give her means of egress, and she withdrew for the night. The supper was excellent; and though the Castle was rather subject to dry-rot insomuch that it tasted like a bad nut, and though the pig might have been farther off, I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment. Nor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom, beyond there being such a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff, that when I lay down on my back in bed, it seemed as if I had to balance that pole on my forehead all night.</p> 
<p>Wemmick was up early in the morning, and I am afraid I heard him cleaning my boots. After that, he fell to gardening, and I saw him from my gothic window pretending to employ the Aged, and nodding at him in a most devoted manner. Our breakfast was as good as the supper, and at half-past eight precisely we started for Little Britain. By degrees, Wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along, and his mouth tightened into a post-office again. At last, when we got to his place of business and he pulled out his key from his coat-collar, he looked as unconscious of his Walworth property as if the Castle and the drawbridge and the arbour and the lake and the fountain and the Aged, had all been blown into space together by the last discharge of the Stinger.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>本特莱·德鲁莫尔是一个紧绷着脸的人，甚至在读书时也好像书的作者伤害了他一样，至于对待他所熟悉的人自然也不会有一张愉快的笑脸。他的身体长得笨重，行动起来笨拙，思考问题笨头笨脑，甚至在面色上也表现出懒散的迟钝。他那条又大又笨的舌头在嘴巴里懒洋洋地动来动去，就好像他懒洋洋地在房间里踱来踱去一样。他这个人懒散、骄傲、吝啬、沉默寡言，又疑心很重。他出生于桑麦塞郡的有钱人家，从小娇生惯养成这种性格，到了成年做父母的才发现他是个白痴式的人物。本特莱·德鲁莫尔来到鄱凯特先生家时，比鄱凯特先生高一个头，但在脑筋的灵敏度方面比谁都要差半截。</p> 
<p>至于斯塔特普，他被脆弱的母亲宠坏了，应该读书时不读，被关在家里。他一直热爱自己的母亲，对她的崇拜是不可估量的。他长得娇弱秀丽，和女人差不多。赫伯特曾对我说过：“虽然你没有见过他的母亲，但你可以看出她的模样，他和他母亲生得一模一样。”我对待他比对待德鲁莫尔更热情，这是很自然的事。即使从最初几天晚上划船开始，他和我就总是并排划船归家，一路划一路聊天，而本特莱·德鲁莫尔却独自跟在我们后面，沿着高高的河岸在灯芯草丛之中划着。他总是像一头很不安分的两栖动物，即使在潮水迅速地把他冲向前来的时候，他也是偷偷地傍岸而行。我知道他总是在黑暗中跟随着我们，避开江流，而我和斯塔特普的小舟却行驶中流，划破夕阳或冲开月光前进。</p> 
<p>赫伯特是我的亲密伙伴和朋友。我的这条小船也让他使用，两人共同享有，这样他便有机会时常来到汉莫史密斯；他的那套房间也供给我使用，所以我也时常去伦敦。我们经常随时在两地之间步行，所以直至今天我对这条路还有深切的感情，虽然在兴趣方面已比不上当年。那种情感表现了人生初始的青春活力，以及对人生前途的无限希望。</p> 
<p>我在鄱凯特先生家中住了一两个月后，一天卡美拉先生和夫人来到这里。卡美拉是鄱凯特先生的妹妹。乔其亚娜也来了，我过去在郝维仙小姐家中曾见到过她。她是鄱凯特先生的表妹。这是一位消化道有毛病的独身妇女，把自己的刚硬性格称为宗教信仰，又把自己的肝火旺盛称为充满情意。这批人十分贪婪，又没有得逞，所以用这种失望的怨气把我恨之入骨。现在他们看到我正在走运，又怀着卑鄙无耻的心情对我无限奉承。他们把鄱凯特先生当成一个大孩子，因为他对自身的利益毫不注意，早在郝维仙小姐家中我就听他们自鸣得意地表示过对他的宽容。他们很看不上鄱凯特夫人，不过也承认这个可怜的女人在生活中确实遭受到失望的沉重打击，因为从她身上多少也可照出他们自己的影子。</p> 
<p>这些便是我当时在伦敦的环境，我就生活于那个环境，也在这环境中接受着教育。不久我就沾上了大手大脚花钱的习惯，如果在几个月之前我一定会认为如此花钱是极其荒唐的；不过，从读书这方面看，不管怎样我还是坚持下去了。当然，这并非是什么了不起的成绩，只不过我对自己在文化方面的缺陷是有足够认识的。由于鄱凯特先生和赫伯特的耐心帮助，我的进步倒是挺快的。不管什么时间他们两个人中总有一个和我在一起，给予我所需要的启发，扫清前进道路上的障碍。假使连这些也疏忽的话，我岂不是也成为了一个像德鲁莫尔一样的大傻瓜了。</p> 
<p>我已经有几个星期没有见到温米克先生，我想起这件事便写信给他，说计划在某一个下午到他家中去做客。他回信给我，表示我去访问是他的特大荣幸，并且说他希望我在当天下午六点钟到律师事务所找他。我按约定时间到达他那里，正好钟敲六时，他也正把保险箱的钥匙塞到领子里去挂在背上。</p> 
<p>“我们步行到伍尔华斯去，你看怎么样？”他征求我的意见。</p> 
<p>“只要你赞成，我们就这么办！”我说道。</p> 
<p>“我是双手赞成，”温米克答道，“我整天把两条腿放在办公桌下面，现在让它们活动伸展一下，真太高兴了。现在告诉你我为你准备的晚餐吧，皮普先生，一盘焖牛排，这是家里做的；一只冷烤鸡，这是从饭店里买来的。这只鸡一定很鲜嫩，因为这家店的老板是我们前几天经手案件中的陪审员，我们让他安安稳稳地过了关，没有为难他。在向他买鸡时，我特意提醒他说：‘喂，老伙计，给我拣一只好的，要知道，那次我们本可以多留你几天，为难你一下的。’于是他连忙说道：‘我选一只店里最好的鸡作为送给您的礼品吧。’自然我便接受了他的美意。说到底，这也是件财产，至少是件动产。我想，你不会讨厌一位上了年纪的老爸爸吧。”</p> 
<p>我真以为他说的这个老爸爸是鸡呢，直到后来他说：“因为我有一个上了年纪的父亲在家中。”于是，我便说了几句礼节上的客套话。</p> 
<p>“你还没有和贾格斯先生一起吃过饭吧？”我们一路走着，他一面问我。</p> 
<p>“还没有。”</p> 
<p>“今天下午听说你要到我家里来，他提到了这件事。我想明天他会请你吃饭，而且他还要请你的好朋友，一共三个人，对吗？”</p> 
<p>虽然我并没有把德鲁莫尔作为我亲密圈子中的成员之一，但还是作了肯定的答复。</p> 
<p>“是嘛，他准备请你们一帮子人去吃饭。”我感到他用这个“帮”字是不够礼貌的。”不管他请你们吃什么，总是上等品。在花式品种上不要指望太多，但质量上总是头等的。他家里还有一件奇妙的事，”温米克停顿了一下，我以为他所说的奇妙之事是他曾说过的管家妇呢，然而他继续说道，“晚上他从来都是不锁门窗的。”</p> 
<p>“他家里从来不会失窃吗？”</p> 
<p>“问题就在这里！”温米克说道，“他总是说，并且在大庭广众之下说：‘我倒想看一看谁敢来偷盗我的东西！’天啦，我曾经在前面办公室中听他对惯偷惯盗讲过有一百次，‘你们知道我住的地方，你们知道我的门窗都不上插销，为什么你们不和我打一次交道？来吧，我那么没有诱惑力吗？你们可以试一试。’先生，真没有一个人有如此胆量去试一下，无论如何没有一个人敢。”</p> 
<p>“他们如此地怕他吗？”我问道。</p> 
<p>“怕他，”温米克答道，“我想你说得对，他们怕他。其实这是他的心计，他根本无视他们。他家中没有任何银器，先生，连调羹都是铜锡合金的。”</p> 
<p>“原来他们没有油水可捞，”我说道，“甚至于他们——”</p> 
<p>“嗳！可是他的油水可大呢，”温米克打断了我的话头，说道，“他们哪有不知道的，他掌握了他们的生死大权，他们几十条性命都在他手掌之中。他想捞什么就能捞到什么，只要他一动心机，凡他想捞的就不可能捞不到。”</p> 
<p>我正思考着我的监护人可是个伟大的人物，这时温米克说道：</p> 
<p>“至于他家中没有银器，说明他懂得人情世故。水有缓急深浅，人有理智情义。他知道如何处理人生常事，不妨看看他的表链，那可是货真价实的宝贝。”</p> 
<p>“表链的确非常粗大。”</p> 
<p>“粗大？”温米克重复了我说的话，“确实如此，不过他的表也是真金的弹簧自鸣表；少说也值一百英镑。皮普先生，在伦敦这个城市中有七百左右个盗贼，他们对这个表的结构一清二楚。在这些盗贼中无论男的、女的、老的、少的，可以说没有一个不认识这表链上的小环，可要是诱惑他们去碰一下，他们会像炭火烧着手一样赶忙丢掉，”</p> 
<p>一开始我们谈的就是这些事情，后来我又谈了更加日常的事务，温米克先生和我便这样消磨了路上的时间，接着他就告诉我，我们已经到了伍尔华斯的地界。</p> 
<p>这里都是一条条僻静的小巷。沟渠和一座座小花园，给人的感觉是一个阴郁迟钝的幽静地方。温米克的房子是一幢小小的木屋，在一座花园的中央，屋顶砌得很像一座炮楼，上面还架着炮。</p> 
<p>“这是我自己的手艺，”温米克说道，“看上去蛮漂亮，你说呢？”</p> 
<p>我高度地赞扬了它，不过我想这是我生平见过的最小的屋子，还有着最奇怪的哥特式窗户，当然多数是些虚饰，另外门也是哥特式的，而且很小，小得几乎难以走进去。</p> 
<p>“你看，这是一根真正的旗杆，”温米克说道，“每逢星期天我还要升起一面真正的旗帜。再看这里，这是一座吊桥，过了这桥，再把它升起来，便和外界的交通隔绝了。”</p> 
<p>这座桥其实是一块木板，架在一条水沟上，水沟大约四英尺宽二英尺深。看他带着骄傲的神情升起吊桥并把它拴牢倒是挺有趣的。他微笑着，这微笑可是津津有味的，而不是刻板做作的。</p> 
<p>“每天晚上九时正，是指格林威治标准时间，”温米克说道，“便开始放炮。你看炮就在那边！听到放炮的声音，我想你会认为这门炮是很有威力的。”</p> 
<p>他所说的这门炮是架在一个单独的堡垒上的，堡垒由铁格子构成。为了防止风吹雨打，炮上用柏油防雨布盖住，具有雨伞的功用。</p> 
<p>“此外，”温米克说道，“在后面人们看不到的地方——所以不让人们看见，是为了突出堡垒，不阻碍观赏堡垒——我有个原则，想做一件事，便动手去做，还要坚持到底——不知道你对此有何看法——”</p> 
<p>我对他所说的话表示了完全的肯定。</p> 
<p>“在后面我喂了一头猪、几只家禽，还有几只兔子；我还搭成一个小瓜棚，你看，上面正结着黄瓜；在晚餐时你可以品尝一下用这里的黄瓜做出的色拉。所以，小老弟，”温米克又一次微笑着并严肃认真地摇着他的头说道，“不妨设想一下，要是这个小小所在被包围起来，在供应方面可不用发愁，要坚持多久就能坚持多久。”</p> 
<p>然后，他把我引到一个只有大约十来码远的亭子里，可这条路设计得弯弯曲曲，我们抵达亭子倒也花了相当一段时间。在这一个僻静的所在，我们的酒杯早已整齐地放好了。亭子的旁边是一个装饰性的人工湖，为我们准备的混合酒也已经冰镇在湖水之中。这是一片圆形的水面，中心有一小岛，很可能是为晚餐准备的色拉。在湖中他还设计了一道喷泉，是运用小风车的动力，喷水口有一个软木塞，只要拨开软木塞，喷出的泉水足可以把你的手背喷湿。</p> 
<p>“我就是工程师，是木匠，是管道工，还是花园里的园丁，总而言之我是万能工匠，有什么干什么，”温米克很感谢我对他的赞扬，说，“本来嘛，自己动手是件好事，你知道，它可以把从新门监狱带回来的蜘蛛网洗刷干净，它可以使老人欢欣。对了，把老人介绍给你，你不会在意吧？你说行吗？不会惹你不高兴吧？”</p> 
<p>我说我十分高兴能见到他，于是我们走进了城堡。我看到一位很老很老的老人坐在火炉旁边，穿着干净的法兰绒外套，精神愉快，恬适自然，保养得也很好，不称心的是耳聋得太厉害。</p> 
<p>“老爸爸，你好，”温米克一面说着，一面半开玩笑地和他亲切握手，“你好吗？”</p> 
<p>“约翰，我可好呢，真好！”这位老人答话道。</p> 
<p>“老爸爸，这是皮普先生，”温米克说道，“我希望您老听清他的名字。皮普先生，你给他点一下头，因为他喜欢别人对他点头。你要高兴就对他点点头，他喜欢点头就像别人喜欢眨眼一样。”</p> 
<p>我尽量向他连连点头，老人大声说道：“先生，这里是我儿子的好地方，先生，这是一块相当好的游览胜地。这处地方和里面的美妙杰作在我儿子归天后应由国家接管，让人民大众来享乐。”</p> 
<p>“老爸爸，你为这块地方骄傲非凡，是不是？”温米克说道，凝神注视着老人，他那张严峻无情的脸上这时现出了温柔的笑容。“现在给你一点头，”他狠命地点了一下头，“现在给你二点头，”他又狠命地点了一下头，然后对老人说：“你喜欢别人对你点头，是不是？”然后对我说：“皮普先生，你要不厌烦的话（虽然我知道这对陌生人来讲是够厌烦的），你是不是给他再点一次头？你不会想到这会令他老人家多高兴啦！”</p> 
<p>我也用劲地频频给老人点头，老人的兴致很高，振作一下精神喂鸡鸭去了。我们两人便坐在凉亭里开始饮混合酒。温米克一面拍着他的烟斗，一面向我讲述，说他花了许多年时间才把家业治理得如此完美。</p> 
<p>“温米克先生，这是你自己的家产吗？”</p> 
<p>“噢，是我的，”温米克说道，“我是慢慢地一点一滴地积累起来的。以国王的名义，这是我世袭的不动产。”</p> 
<p>“这是真的？但愿贾格斯先生对此也会敬佩惊叹的！”</p> 
<p>“他没有见过这里，”温米克说道，“也没有听说过这里的事。他也没有见过老人，也没有听说过他。须知，事务所是一件事，私人生活是另一件事。我去到事务所就把城堡丢在脑后，我回到城堡又把事务所丢在脑后。如果你对此不感到讨厌，还得请你赞同我这种做法。我不打算在谈业务的时候谈自己的私事。”</p> 
<p>自然，我诚心诚意向他表示，我尊重他的请求。混合酒是十分可口的，我们坐在那儿一面饮酒一面叙谈，一直谈到将近九点钟。“就该放炮了，”温米克说着，放下了他的烟斗，“这是老人最愉快的事。”</p> 
<p>我们走回城堡，看到老人正在那里把拨火棍放在火上烧，双眼充满了期望的神色，在为这一夜里的伟大典礼做准备工作。温米克一手抓着表站在那里，等待着时刻到来，便从老人手中接过拨火棍，向炮台走去。他带着拔火棍走出去，霎时间，大炮用其巨大的轰隆声表示出自己的雄威，震得这幢小木屋像要倒坍一样，桌上的杯盘碗碟也给震得哗啦啦直响。至于这位老人，我想他本该震得从椅子上跌下来，幸亏他两手紧紧抓住椅柄，总算稳住了。他欢天喜地地喊道：“放炮了！我听到了炮声！”于是我向他连连点头，毫不夸大地说，一直点到头发晕，连他老人家的影子也看不到了。</p> 
<p>在晚餐前的一段时间中，温米克领着我参观了他收藏的奇珍异品。特别要说起的是这些东西都与某些重大犯罪案件有关系，其中有一枝著名文件伪造案用的笔、和重大案件有关的一两把刺刀、几把头发，还有几份临刑前写下的交待书。温米克先生最看重这些手稿，用他本人的话来说这是因为“这里的每一份手稿都是在扯谎，先生。”这些东西和一些小瓷器小酒杯杂乱地放在一起，倒颇耐人寻味，另外还有一些该博物馆主人自己亲手做成的各式各样精致玩意儿，以及那位老人刻成的往烟斗里塞烟丝的用具。所有这些东西都展览在那间我被带进城堡时最先到达的房间中。这间屋子不仅是他家的日常起居室，而且也是他家的厨房。我所以如此判断，是因为在炉架上放着一口带柄的小锅，在壁炉上方还有一个铜制的小玩艺儿，看来是挂烤叉用的。</p> 
<p>一位穿着很整洁的小女孩侍候我们进餐，白天她是照看老人家的。她把晚餐的一切料理妥当后，便放下吊桥，让她出去，回到自己家过夜。这顿晚餐丰盛可口，虽然城堡里总有一股干枯木头味，闻起来很像变了质的硬果，另外隔壁还喂养着一头猪。无论如何，我对于这顿晚餐是十分心满意足的。晚间，我睡在城堡的小小亭子间里，也感到十分不错，没有什么缺陷。不过，我自己的身体和那根旗杆之间仅隔着一层薄薄的天花板，因此躺在床上时，我就好像不得不整夜都把旗杆顶在头上一样。</p> 
<p>温米克在早晨很早便起身了，我仿佛还听到他在洗刷我鞋子的声音。然后，他去园子里干活，我从哥特式的窗口看到他对老人家连连点头，一副非常恭敬的神态，装出想让老人家帮他干些活的模样。这天的早餐和昨天的晚餐一样美味可口。整八时半，我们开始出发，向小不列颠街走去。我们愈向前走，温米克变得愈冷淡无趣和刻薄严厉。他的那张嘴也愈来愈抿得像一个邮筒口。最后我们一走到事务所，他就从衣领里取出那串钥匙。这时，关于伍尔华斯的产业他早已忘到了九霄云外，仿佛城堡、吊桥、凉亭、小湖，以及那喷泉、那老人等等都被那有威力的大炮统统炸得灰飞烟灭了。</p>
