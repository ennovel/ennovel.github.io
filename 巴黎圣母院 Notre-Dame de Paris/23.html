It procured for him, at about the epoch when he refused to see Madame de Beaujeu, a visit which he long remembered.</p> 
<p>It was in the evening. He had just retired, after the office, to his canon's cell in the cloister of Notre-Dame. This cell, with the exception, possibly, of some glass phials, relegated to a corner, and filled with a decidedly equivocal powder, which strongly resembled the alchemist's "powder of projection," presented nothing strange or mysterious. There were, indeed, here and there, some inscriptions on the walls, but they were pure sentences of learning and piety, extracted from good authors. The archdeacon had just seated himself, by the light of a three-jetted copper lamp, before a vast coffer crammed with manuscripts. He had rested his elbow upon the open volume of _Honorius d'Autun_, ~De predestinatione et libero arbitrio~, and he was turning over, in deep meditation, the leaves of a printed folio which he had just brought, the sole product of the press which his cell contained. In the midst of his revery there came a knock at his door. "Who's there?" cried the learned man, in the gracious tone of a famished dog, disturbed over his bone.</p> 
<p>A voice without replied, "Your friend, Jacques Coictier." He went to open the door.</p> 
<p>It was, in fact, the king's physician; a person about fifty years of age, whose harsh physiognomy was modified only by a crafty eye. Another man accompanied him. Both wore long slate-colored robes, furred with minever, girded and closed, with caps of the same stuff and hue. Their hands were concealed by their sleeves, their feet by their robes, their eyes by their caps.</p> 
<p>"God help me, messieurs!" said the archdeacon, showing them in; "I was not expecting distinguished visitors at such an hour." And while speaking in this courteous fashion he cast an uneasy and scrutinizing glance from the physician to his companion.</p> 
<p>"'Tis never too late to come and pay a visit to so considerable a learned man as Dom Claude Frollo de Tirechappe," replied Doctor Coictier, whose Franche-Comté accent made all his phrases drag along with the majesty of a train-robe.</p> 
<p>There then ensued between the physician and the archdeacon one of those congratulatory prologues which, in accordance with custom, at that epoch preceded all conversations between learned men, and which did not prevent them from detesting each other in the most cordial manner in the world. However, it is the same nowadays; every wise man's mouth complimenting another wise man is a vase of honeyed gall.</p> 
<p>Claude Frollo's felicitations to Jacques Coictier bore reference principally to the temporal advantages which the worthy physician had found means to extract, in the course of his much envied career, from each malady of the king, an operation of alchemy much better and more certain than the pursuit of the philosopher's stone.</p> 
<p>"In truth, Monsieur le Docteur Coictier, I felt great joy on learning of the bishopric given your nephew, my reverend seigneur Pierre Verse. Is he not Bishop of Amiens?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, monsieur Archdeacon; it is a grace and mercy of God."</p> 
<p>"Do you know that you made a great figure on Christmas Day at the bead of your company of the chamber of accounts, Monsieur President?"</p> 
<p>"Vice-President, Dom Claude. Alas! nothing more."</p> 
<p>"How is your superb house in the Rue Saint-André des Arcs coming on? 'Tis a Louvre. I love greatly the apricot tree which is carved on the door, with this play of words: 'A L'ABRI-COTIER--Sheltered from reefs.'"</p> 
<p>"Alas! Master Claude, all that masonry costeth me dear. In proportion as the house is erected, I am ruined."</p> 
<p>"Ho! have you not your revenues from the jail, and the bailiwick of the Palais, and the rents of all the houses, sheds, stalls, and booths of the enclosure? 'Tis a fine breast to suck."</p> 
<p>"My castellany of Poissy has brought me in nothing this year."</p> 
<p>"But your tolls of Triel, of Saint-James, of Saint-Germainen-Laye are always good."</p> 
<p>"Six score livres, and not even Parisian livres at that."</p> 
<p>"You have your office of counsellor to the king. That is fixed."</p> 
<p>"Yes, brother Claude; but that accursed seigneury of Poligny, which people make so much noise about, is worth not sixty gold crowns, year out and year in."</p> 
<p>In the compliments which Dom Claude addressed to Jacques Coictier, there was that sardonical, biting, and covertly mocking accent, and the sad cruel smile of a superior and unhappy man who toys for a moment, by way of distraction, with the dense prosperity of a vulgar man. The other did not perceive it.</p> 
<p>"Upon my soul," said Claude at length, pressing his hand, "I am glad to see you and in such good health."</p> 
<p>"Thanks, Master Claude."</p> 
<p>"By the way," exclaimed Dom Claude, "how is your royal patient?"</p> 
<p>"He payeth not sufficiently his physician," replied the doctor, casting a side glance at his companion.</p> 
<p>"Think you so, Gossip Coictier," said the latter.</p> 
<p>These words, uttered in a tone of surprise and reproach, drew upon this unknown personage the attention of the archdeacon which, to tell the truth, had not been diverted from him a single moment since the stranger had set foot across the threshold of his cell. It had even required all the thousand reasons which he had for handling tenderly Doctor Jacques Coictier, the all-powerful physician of King Louis XI., to induce him to receive the latter thus accompanied. Hence, there was nothing very cordial in his manner when Jacques Coictier said to him,--</p> 
<p>"By the way, Dom Claude, I bring you a colleague who has desired to see you on account of your reputation."</p> 
<p>"Monsieur belongs to science?" asked the archdeacon, fixing his piercing eye upon Coictier's companion. He found beneath the brows of the stranger a glance no less piercing or less distrustful than his own.</p> 
<p>He was, so far as the feeble light of the lamp permitted one to judge, an old man about sixty years of age and of medium stature, who appeared somewhat sickly and broken in health. His profile, although of a very ordinary outline, had something powerful and severe about it; his eyes sparkled beneath a very deep superciliary arch, like a light in the depths of a cave; and beneath his cap which was well drawn down and fell upon his nose, one recognized the broad expanse of a brow of genius.</p> 
<p>He took it upon himself to reply to the archdeacon's question,--</p> 
<p>"Reverend master," he said in a grave tone, "your renown has reached my ears, and I wish to consult you. I am but a poor provincial gentleman, who removeth his shoes before entering the dwellings of the learned. You must know my name. I am called Gossip Tourangeau."</p> 
<p>"Strange name for a gentleman," said the archdeacon to himself.</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, he had a feeling that he was in the presence of a strong and earnest character. The instinct of his own lofty intellect made him recognize an intellect no less lofty under Gossip Tourangeau's furred cap, and as he gazed at the solemn face, the ironical smile which Jacques Coictier's presence called forth on his gloomy face, gradually disappeared as twilight fades on the horizon of night. Stern and silent, he had resumed his seat in his great armchair; his elbow rested as usual, on the table, and his brow on his hand. After a few moments of reflection, he motioned his visitors to be seated, and, turning to Gossip Tourangeau he said,--</p> 
<p>"You come to consult me, master, and upon what science?"</p> 
<p>"Your reverence," replied Tourangeau, "I am ill, very ill. You are said to be great AEsculapius, and I am come to ask your advice in medicine."</p> 
<p>"Medicine!" said the archdeacon, tossing his head. He seemed to meditate for a moment, and then resumed: "Gossip Tourangeau, since that is your name, turn your head, you will find my reply already written on the wall."</p> 
<p>Gossip Tourangeau obeyed, and read this inscription engraved above his head: "Medicine is the daughter of dreams.--JAMBLIQUE."</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Doctor Jacques Coictier had heard his companion's question with a displeasure which Dom Claude's response had but redoubled. He bent down to the ear of Gossip Tourangeau, and said to him, softly enough not to be heard by the archdeacon: "I warned you that he was mad. You insisted on seeing him."</p> 
<p>"'Tis very possible that he is right, madman as he is, Doctor Jacques," replied his comrade in the same low tone, and with a bitter smile.</p> 
<p>"As you please," replied Coictier dryly. Then, addressing the archdeacon: "You are clever at your trade, Dom Claude, and you are no more at a loss over Hippocrates than a monkey is over a nut. Medicine a dream! I suspect that the pharmacopolists and the master physicians would insist upon stoning you if they were here. So you deny the influence of philtres upon the blood, and unguents on the skin! You deny that eternal pharmacy of flowers and metals, which is called the world, made expressly for that eternal invalid called man!"</p> 
<p>"I deny," said Dom Claude coldly, "neither pharmacy nor the invalid. I reject the physician."</p> 
<p>"Then it is not true," resumed Coictier hotly, "that gout is an internal eruption; that a wound caused by artillery is to be cured by the application of a young mouse roasted; that young blood, properly injected, restores youth to aged veins; it is not true that two and two make four, and that emprostathonos follows opistathonos."</p> 
<p>The archdeacon replied without perturbation: "There are certain things of which I think in a certain fashion."</p> 
<p>Coictier became crimson with anger.</p> 
<p>"There, there, my good Coictier, let us not get angry," said Gossip Tourangeau. "Monsieur the archdeacon is our friend."</p> 
<p>Coictier calmed down, muttering in a low tone,--</p> 
<p>"After all, he's mad."</p> 
<p>"~Pasque-dieu~, Master Claude," resumed Gossip Tourangeau, after a silence, "You embarrass me greatly. I had two things to consult you upon, one touching my health and the other touching my star."</p> 
<p>"Monsieur," returned the archdeacon, "if that be your motive, you would have done as well not to put yourself out of breath climbing my staircase. I do not believe in Medicine. I do not believe in Astrology."</p> 
<p>"Indeed!" said the man, with surprise.</p> 
<p>Coictier gave a forced laugh.</p> 
<p>"You see that he is mad," he said, in a low tone, to Gossip Tourangeau. "He does not believe in astrology."</p> 
<p>"The idea of imagining," pursued Dom Claude, "that every ray of a star is a thread which is fastened to the head of a man!"</p> 
<p>"And what then, do you believe in?" exclaimed Gossip Tourangeau.</p> 
<p>The archdeacon hesitated for a moment, then he allowed a gloomy smile to escape, which seemed to give the lie to his response: "~Credo in Deum~."</p> 
<p>"~Dominum nostrum~," added Gossip Tourangeau, making the sign of the cross.</p> 
<p>"Amen," said Coictier.</p> 
<p>"Reverend master," resumed Tourangeau, "I am charmed in soul to see you in such a religious frame of mind. But have you reached the point, great savant as you are, of no longer believing in science?"</p> 
<p>"No," said the archdeacon, grasping the arm of Gossip Tourangeau, and a ray of enthusiasm lighted up his gloomy eyes, "no, I do not reject science. I have not crawled so long, flat on my belly, with my nails in the earth, through the innumerable ramifications of its caverns, without perceiving far in front of me, at the end of the obscure gallery, a light, a flame, a something, the reflection, no doubt, of the dazzling central laboratory where the patient and the wise have found out God."</p> 
<p>"And in short," interrupted Tourangeau, "what do you hold to be true and certain?"</p> 
<p>"Alchemy."</p> 
<p>Coictier exclaimed, "Pardieu, Dom Claude, alchemy has its use, no doubt, but why blaspheme medicine and astrology?"</p> 
<p>"Naught is your science of man, naught is your science of the stars," said the archdeacon, commandingly.</p> 
<p>"That's driving Epidaurus and Chaldea very fast," replied the physician with a grin.</p> 
<p>"Listen, Messire Jacques. This is said in good faith. I am not the king's physician, and his majesty has not given me the Garden of Daedalus in which to observe the constellations. Don't get angry, but listen to me. What truth have you deduced, I will not say from medicine, which is too foolish a thing, but from astrology? Cite to me the virtues of the vertical boustrophedon, the treasures of the number ziruph and those of the number zephirod!"</p> 
<p>"Will you deny," said Coictier, "the sympathetic force of the collar bone, and the cabalistics which are derived from it?"</p> 
<p>"An error, Messire Jacques! None of your formulas end in reality. Alchemy on the other hand has its discoveries. Will you contest results like this? Ice confined beneath the earth for a thousand years is transformed into rock crystals. Lead is the ancestor of all metals. For gold is not a metal, gold is light. Lead requires only four periods of two hundred years each, to pass in succession from the state of lead, to the state of red arsenic, from red arsenic to tin, from tin to silver. Are not these facts? But to believe in the collar bone, in the full line and in the stars, is as ridiculous as to believe with the inhabitants of Grand-Cathay that the golden oriole turns into a mole, and that grains of wheat turn into fish of the carp species."</p> 
<p>"I have studied hermetic science!" exclaimed Coictier, "and I affirm--"</p> 
<p>The fiery archdeacon did not allow him to finish: "And I have studied medicine, astrology, and hermetics. Here alone is the truth." (As he spoke thus, he took from the top of the coffer a phial filled with the powder which we have mentioned above), "here alone is light! Hippocrates is a dream; Urania is a dream; Hermes, a thought. Gold is the sun; to make gold is to be God. Herein lies the one and only science. I have sounded the depths of medicine and astrology, I tell you! Naught, nothingness! The human body, shadows! the planets, shadows!"</p> 
<p>And he fell back in his armchair in a commanding and inspired attitude. Gossip Touraugeau watched him in silence. Coictier tried to grin, shrugged his shoulders imperceptibly, and repeated in a low voice,--</p> 
<p>"A madman!"</p> 
<p>"And," said Tourangeau suddenly, "the wondrous result,-- have you attained it, have you made gold?"</p> 
<p>"If I had made it," replied the archdeacon, articulating his words slowly, like a man who is reflecting, "the king of France would be named Claude and not Louis."</p> 
<p>The stranger frowned.</p> 
<p>"What am I saying?" resumed Dom Claude, with a smile of disdain. "What would the throne of France be to me when I could rebuild the empire of the Orient?"</p> 
<p>"Very good!" said the stranger.</p> 
<p>"Oh, the poor fool!" murmured Coictier.</p> 
<p>The archdeacon went on, appearing to reply now only to his thoughts,--</p> 
<p>"But no, I am still crawling; I am scratching my face and knees against the pebbles of the subterranean pathway. I catch a glimpse, I do not contemplate! I do not read, I spell out!"</p> 
<p>"And when you know how to read!" demanded the stranger, "will you make gold?"</p> 
<p>"Who doubts it?" said the archdeacon.</p> 
<p>"In that case Our Lady knows that I am greatly in need of money, and I should much desire to read in your books. Tell me, reverend master, is your science inimical or displeasing to Our Lady?"</p> 
<p>"Whose archdeacon I am?" Dom Claude contented himself with replying, with tranquil hauteur.</p> 
<p>"That is true, my master. Well! will it please you to initiate me? Let me spell with you."</p> 
<p>Claude assumed the majestic and pontifical attitude of a Samuel.</p> 
<p>"Old man, it requires longer years than remain to you, to undertake this voyage across mysterious things. Your head is very gray! One comes forth from the cavern only with white hair, but only those with dark hair enter it. Science alone knows well how to hollow, wither, and dry up human faces; she needs not to have old age bring her faces already furrowed. Nevertheless, if the desire possesses you of putting yourself under discipline at your age, and of deciphering the formidable alphabet of the sages, come to me; 'tis well, I will make the effort. I will not tell you, poor old man, to go and visit the sepulchral chambers of the pyramids, of which ancient Herodotus speaks, nor the brick tower of Babylon, nor the immense white marble sanctuary of the Indian temple of Eklinga. I, no more than yourself, have seen the Chaldean masonry works constructed according to the sacred form of the Sikra, nor the temple of Solomon, which is destroyed, nor the stone doors of the sepulchre of the kings of Israel, which are broken. We will content ourselves with the fragments of the book of Hermes which we have here. I will explain to you the statue of Saint Christopher, the symbol of the sower, and that of the two angels which are on the front of the Sainte-Chapelle, and one of which holds in his hands a vase, the other, a cloud--"</p> 
<p>Here Jacques Coictier, who had been unhorsed by the archdeacon's impetuous replies, regained his saddle, and interrupted him with the triumphant tone of one learned man correcting another,--"~Erras amice Claudi~. The symbol is not the number. You take Orpheus for Hermes."</p> 
<p>"'Tis you who are in error," replied the archdeacon, gravely. "Daedalus is the base; Orpheus is the wall; Hermes is the edifice,--that is all. You shall come when you will," he continued, turning to Tourangeau, "I will show you the little parcels of gold which remained at the bottom of Nicholas Flamel's alembic, and you shall compare them with the gold of Guillaume de Paris. I will teach you the secret virtues of the Greek word, ~peristera~. But, first of all, I will make you read, one after the other, the marble letters of the alphabet, the granite pages of the book. We shall go to the portal of Bishop Guillaume and of Saint-Jean le Rond at the Sainte- Chapelle, then to the house of Nicholas Flamel, Rue Manvault, to his tomb, which is at the Saints-Innocents, to his two hospitals, Rue de Montmorency. I will make you read the hieroglyphics which cover the four great iron cramps on the portal of the hospital Saint-Gervais, and of the Rue de la Ferronnerie. We will spell out in company, also, the fa?ade of Saint-Come, of Sainte-Geneviève-des-Ardents, of Saint Martin, of Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie--."</p> 
<p>For a long time, Gossip Tourangeau, intelligent as was his glance, had appeared not to understand Dom Claude. He interrupted.</p> 
<p>"~Pasque-dieu~! what are your books, then?"</p> 
<p>"Here is one of them," said the archdeacon.</p> 
<p>And opening the window of his cell he pointed out with his finger the immense church of Notre-Dame, which, outlining against the starry sky the black silhouette of its two towers, its stone flanks, its monstrous haunches, seemed an enormous two-headed sphinx, seated in the middle of the city.</p> 
<p>The archdeacon gazed at the gigantic edifice for some time in silence, then extending his right hand, with a sigh, towards the printed book which lay open on the table, and his left towards Notre-Dame, and turning a sad glance from the book to the church,--"Alas," he said, "this will kill that."</p> 
<p>Coictier, who had eagerly approached the book, could not repress an exclamation. "Hé, but now, what is there so formidable in this: 'GLOSSA IN EPISTOLAS D. PAULI, ~Norimbergoe, Antonius Koburger~, 1474.' This is not new. 'Tis a book of Pierre Lombard, the Master of Sentences. Is it because it is printed?"</p> 
<p>"You have said it," replied Claude, who seemed absorbed in a profound meditation, and stood resting, his forefinger bent backward on the folio which had come from the famous press of Nuremberg. Then he added these mysterious words: "Alas! alas! small things come at the end of great things; a tooth triumphs over a mass. The Nile rat kills the crocodile, the swordfish kills the whale, the book will kill the edifice."</p> 
<p>The curfew of the cloister sounded at the moment when Master Jacques was repeating to his companion in low tones, his eternal refrain, "He is mad!" To which his companion this time replied, "I believe that he is."</p> 
<p>It was the hour when no stranger could remain in the cloister. The two visitors withdrew. "Master," said Gossip Tourangeau, as he took leave of the archdeacon, "I love wise men and great minds, and I hold you in singular esteem. Come to-morrow to the Palace des Tournelles, and inquire for the Abbé de Sainte-Martin, of Tours."</p> 
<p>The archdeacon returned to his chamber dumbfounded, comprehending at last who Gossip Tourangeau was, and recalling that passage of the register of Sainte-Martin, of Tours:-- ~Abbas beati Martini, SCILICET REX FRANCIAE, est canonicus de consuetudine et habet parvam proebendam quam habet sanctus Venantius, et debet sedere in sede thesaurarii~.</p> 
<p>It is asserted that after that epoch the archdeacon had frequent conferences with Louis XI., when his majesty came to Paris, and that Dom Claude's influence quite overshadowed that of Olivier le Daim and Jacques Coictier, who, as was his habit, rudely took the king to task on that account.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>克洛德的名声传扬得很远。这使他在拒绝接见波热夫人之后不久，又必须接受一次访问。他把有关这件事的记忆保存了很久。</p> 
<p>那是一个傍晚，他刚从办公房回到圣母院修道院他那间密室里。那小房间除了角落里放着几只封好的玻璃小药瓶之外，全是一片灰尘，就象幻灯上的灰尘似的，并没有什么神秘奇怪。墙上到处是字迹，但那全是些纯粹的科学术语，或是从优秀的作家那儿摘录来的虔诚的语句。副主教刚刚在一张放满了原稿的大台子前面坐下来，面对着三只嘴的铜烛台的亮光，靠在一本打开了的书上，这是俄诺里雅斯·德·俄当所著的《论宿命和自由意志》。</p> 
<p>他一页一页地翻阅着刚才拿来的一本对开的印刷本，一边深深进行思考，那是他的密室里唯一的印刷品。正当他沉入了梦一般的境界时，有人敲门了。</p> 
<p>“谁呀？”这位学者喊道，声音就象饿狗被抢走了肉骨头那么好听。一个声音在门外回答道：“是你的朋友雅克·夸克纪埃。”于是他走去开门。</p> 
<p>那的确是国王的医生，一个五十来岁的人，他的面貌由于眼光狡猾才显得不那么生硬。另外有一个人伴同着他。两人都穿着深红色带小灰点的长袍，束着腰带，裹得严严实实，戴着同样质地和颜色的帽子。他们的手被衣袖遮住了，脚被长袍遮住了，眼睛被帽沿遮住了。</p> 
<p>“愿上帝帮助我，先生们，”副主教说，一面把他们让进房间，“我没料到在这种时候还能得到你们来访的荣幸呢。”副主教一面彬彬有礼地说着，一面用不安的探究的眼光看看医生，又看看他的朋友。</p> 
<p>“对于拜访蒂尔夏浦的克洛德·孚罗洛这样有名的学者，这时辰还不能算太晚呀。”夸克纪埃医生说。他那纯粹外省人的口音，使他的话象他那带后裾的庄严的袍子一样，拖得很长。</p> 
<p>于是副主教和医生之间开始了当时学者们谈话之前照例的寒暄，但这并不能阻止他俩比世界上任何人都更互相仇视。何况，如今也还是这样，从一个学者口中倾注给另一个学者的恭维，只不过是一瓶加了蜜的苦胆汁而已。</p> 
<p>克洛德·孚罗洛向雅克·夸克纪埃所说的奉承话，特别抨击了那令人尊敬的医生在业务上的收益，那些收益是他用他那令人羡慕的职业从国王每次疾病中榨取来的，那种职业可是比寻找“炼金石”更为有效而且可靠的一种化学实验呢。</p> 
<p>“真的！夸克纪埃先生，我很高兴听到令侄，我尊敬的比埃尔·维尔塞先生升任了主教。令侄不是亚米昂地方的主教吗？”</p> 
<p>“是的，副主教先生，那是出于上帝的恩赐。”</p> 
<p>“你知道吗？圣诞节那天，当你走在你那位审计院的同伴前头的时候，你的仪容是多么的了不起，总管先生。”</p> 
<p>“只不过是个副总管罢了，堂·克洛德。唉，也就不过如此罢了。”</p> 
<p>“你那圣安德烈·代·亚克街上的宏伟住宅不就在那里吗？那真是一座卢浮宫呢。我很喜欢刻在大门上的杏树和以巧妙的手法刻成的杏—树那两个有趣的字。”</p> 
<p>“唉，克洛德阁下，整个工程花了我很多钱呢。等到房子盖成，我也毁了。”</p> 
<p>“嗬，你不是还有监狱和司法宫执达吏的收入吗？不是还有克罗居的全部房屋、肉铺、客栈和商店的租税吗？这就等于去挤一只有很多乳汁的乳房一样。”</p> 
<p>“今年我那波瓦塞领地没给我带来什么收益。”</p> 
<p>“可是你在特里爱尔，在圣雅姆和在圣日尔曼·昂·雷耶的税收，经常都是很好的呀。”</p> 
<p>“才一百二十里弗，而且还不是巴黎里弗。”</p> 
<p>“你不是还有你那国王参事室的收入吗？那可是固定的。”</p> 
<p>“是的，克洛德教友，但是那该死的波里尼庄园，听说不管好年成还是坏年成都收不到六十个金币。”</p> 
<p>克洛德向夸克纪埃讲的这些恭维话，带着挖苦的尖刻的讽刺语气和一种凄苦冷酷的微笑，这是一个优秀而不走运的人偶尔取笑一下恶人的财富，而那个恶人却没有发觉。</p> 
<p>“凭我的灵魂担保，”最后克洛德握着他的手说道，“看见你十分健康我真高兴。”</p> 
<p>“谢谢，克洛德阁下。”</p> 
<p>“可是，”克洛德忽然高声说，“陛下的御恙怎样了？”</p> 
<p>“他不肯付足他的医药费呀。”医生望了他身边的同伴一眼回答道。</p> 
<p>“你认为是这样吗，夸克纪埃老兄？”那个同伴问。</p> 
<p>这句用诧异和责备的声调吐出来的话，引起了副主教对这个陌生人的注意。说真的，自从那个怪人跨进了小密室的门槛，克洛德就没有一刻不在留神观察他。他应该有上千种理由来小心对待国王路易十一那极其能干的医生雅克·夸克纪埃，既然这位医生让那个人陪伴着他。</p> 
<p>他脸色没有表现半点兴奋，当夸克纪埃告诉他：“可是，堂·克洛德，我给您带来了一位教友，他久仰您的大名，想来拜望您。”</p> 
<p>“先生是搞科学的吧？”副主教用他那明察秋毫的眼光盯着夸克纪埃的同伴。他发觉那陌生人眉毛底下也有着不亚于自己的那种深沉的、不信任的眼光。</p> 
<p>微弱的灯光使人只能看出他是一个六十岁左右的老人，中等身材，好象病得相当厉害，相当衰弱。他的面目虽然很清秀，却有几分坚强和严肃。他的眼睛在弯弯的眉毛下闪着深邃的、仿佛从洞穴里射出来的光芒，在他那几乎遮住了鼻子的帽沿下面，可以感觉到他那聪明的额头上滚动着一双大眼睛。</p> 
<p>他决心亲自来回答副主教的问话。</p> 
<p>“崇敬的阁下，”他用一种严肃的声调说，“您的名声一直传到我的耳朵里，我想来向您求教。我不过是一个走进学者家里之前先得脱掉鞋子的笨拙的外省绅士。应该让您知道我的姓名。我是杜韩若长老。”</p> 
<p>“绅士会有这么个怪名字。”副主教想道。这时他才发觉自己面对着某一强劲的严肃的事物。他的绝顶聪明，使他猜测到杜韩若长老的皮帽下也有着同样的绝顶聪明。他仔细打量那庄严的容貌，雅克·夸克纪埃的到来在他阴沉的面孔上引起的笑容这时便逐渐消失，就象暮色消失在黑夜的天边一样。他忧郁地、沉默地坐在他的大安乐椅中，手肘习惯地支在台子上，手撑着额头。考虑了一会之后，他做了个手势让两位来客坐下，便向杜韩若长老发问道：“阁下，既然您来同我讨论，那么，是讨论哪一种科学呢？”</p> 
<p>“崇敬的阁下，”杜韩若答道，“我病了，病得很厉害。人们说您是一位伟大的艾斯居拉普，我是来请您开一个药方的。”</p> 
<p>“药方！”副主教摇摇头。然后他想了想又说：“杜韩若长老，既然您叫这个名字，请回过头去，您可以看见我的答案已经写在墙上。”</p> 
<p>杜韩若顺从地回过头去，他看见墙头上比他高的地方刻着这样的话：医学是梦幻的女儿。</p> 
<p>——雅北里格这时，雅克·夸克纪埃听见他的同伴提出的可厌的问题得到了堂·克洛德的加倍可厌的回答，便凑到杜韩若长老的耳边，用不让副主教听见的声音向他说：“我早就告诉过您他是个疯子。是您想来看他的！”</p> 
<p>“这个疯子很可能是有理智的呢，雅克医生。”长老用同样低的声音回答，苦恼地微笑了一下。</p> 
<p>“随您的便吧！”夸克纪埃冷冰冰地说道。随后他便同副主教闲谈起来：“堂·克洛德，您在工作上是很灵活的，希波克拉特决不会妨碍您，就象一个胡桃决不会妨碍一只猴子一样。医学是一种梦幻！我想要是走方郎中和医生正在这儿的话，他们会向您投石子的！那么，您是不承认刺激性药品对于血液的影响以及膏药对于肌肉的影响了！这个被人称为一个世界的、特意为那不断生病的所谓人类建立的、由花和金属组成的不朽的药物学，您也是不承认的了？”</p> 
<p>“我既不是否定药物学也不是否定病人，”堂·克洛德冷淡地说道，“我否定的是医生。”</p> 
<p>夸克纪埃激昂地说：“那么风湿病的病灶是一个气孔也不是真的了。用烧焦的老鼠制成的外用药能治好大炮打伤的地方，适当地输入青春的血液能使衰老的血管恢复青春也不是真的了。二加二等于四也不是真的了。”</p> 
<p>副主教不为所动地答道：“对某些事物我有我一定的看法。”</p> 
<p>夸克纪埃气得脸都变红了。</p> 
<p>“得啦，得啦，我的好夸克纪埃，咱们不用生气，”杜韩若长老说，“副主教先生是咱们的朋友。”</p> 
<p>夸克纪埃镇静下来了，但还低声抱怨着：“总之他是个疯子！”</p> 
<p>“克洛德阁下，”杜韩若长老沉默了一会说，“您使我很不好意思呢。</p> 
<p>我有两个疑难问题要向您讨教，一个是关于我的健康的，一个是关于我的星宿的。”</p> 
<p>“先生，”副主教说，“假若这就是您的想法，您实在用不着喘着气爬上我的楼梯。我不相信医学，也不相信占星术。”</p> 
<p>“真的！”杜韩若长老惊讶地说道。</p> 
<p>夸克纪埃勉强地笑了一笑。</p> 
<p>“您很可以看出他是个疯子了，”他在杜韩若长老的耳边低声说，“他连占星术都不相信呢！”</p> 
<p>“那等于去想象每道星光都是长在人们头上的一根发丝！”堂·克洛德补充道。</p> 
<p>“那么您信什么呢？”杜韩若长老高声问道。</p> 
<p>副主教犹豫了一会儿，随后便露出一个阴沉的微笑，好象在否认自己的回答：“信上帝。”</p> 
<p>“我们的主。”杜韩若划了一个十字补充道。</p> 
<p>“阿门！”夸克纪埃说。</p> 
<p>“尊敬的阁下，”那个长老又说，“看到您有这么好的宗教信仰，我真是由衷地感动。可是，您既然是一位大学者，竟至连科学都不相信吗？”</p> 
<p>“不，”副主教呆定定的眼睛里射出一道强烈的光，抓着杜韩若长老的胳膊说，“不，我不是不承认科学。我长时间把肚子贴着地、指甲陷在泥土里爬过地窖里无数条小路，决不会看不见我前面远远的地方有一道亮光，一股火焰之类的东西，那一定是那耀眼的总实验室的反光，那里有耐心的和聪明的人曾经使上帝都吃惊呢。”</p> 
<p>“到底，”杜韩若长老插话说，“您认为什么才是真的和实在的呢？”</p> 
<p>“炼金术。”</p> 
<p>夸克纪埃嚷起来了：“当然啦，堂·克洛德，炼金术一定有它的道理，但是何必咒骂医学和占星术呢？”</p> 
<p>“您那关于人的科学是空洞的。您那关于上天的科学也是空洞的。”副主教武断地说。</p> 
<p>“艾比达须斯和迦勒底地方可是一片兴旺的景象呢！”医生冷笑说。</p> 
<p>“听着，雅克阁下，我说的话是很诚恳的。我不是国王的医生，他陛下也没有赐给我代达罗斯花园让我观察星辰。别生气，听我说吧。您发现了什么真理呢？我不是指医学，那是过于蠢笨的东西。我指的是占星术。请你告诉我那些直上直下的线以及齐鲁夫数字、泽费洛德数字方面的新发现又能说明什么。”</p> 
<p>“您不承认锁骨的感应力和异乎常情的通神术吗？”夸克纪埃说。</p> 
<p>“您错了，雅克先生。您的信念没有一个接近现实，但炼金术却有一些发明。您不承认这些成果吗？玻璃埋在地下千万年之后，就变成水晶石。铅是一切金属的始祖。（因为黄金并不是一种金属，黄金是一种光。）铅只要经过二百年一期一共四期的转化就成功地从铅变为雄黄，从雄黄变成锡，从锡变成银子。这难道不是事实吗？但是相信锁骨，相信星宿和通往星宿的线，那就象中国的居民那样可笑，他们相信黄莺会变成鼹鼠、麦粒会变成鲤鱼！”</p> 
<p>“我学过炼金术，”夸克纪埃嚷道，“我敢断定……”</p> 
<p>可是激奋的副主教不让他说下去。</p> 
<p>“我学过医学、占星术和炼金术。这才是唯一的真理（说着他便把一只我们在前面描述过的盖满了灰尘的小药瓶放在台子上），这才是唯一的光明。</p> 
<p>希波克拉特是一个梦，于拉尼亚是一个梦，艾尔美斯是一种思想。黄金呢，它是太阳。能制造黄金，那就变成神了。这才是独一无二的科学。我研究过医学和占星术。我告诉你：空虚！空虚！人类的躯体是神秘莫测的，星辰也是神秘莫测的！”</p> 
<p>他跌坐在他的安乐椅里，处在受到某种启示的振奋状态中。杜韩若长老默默地望着他。夸克纪埃使劲冷笑着，悄悄地耸耸肩膀，一遍又一遍地低声说：“一个疯子！”</p> 
<p>“但是，”杜韩若长老突然问道，“你达到那美妙的目的没有呢？你炼成了黄金没有呢？”</p> 
<p>“假若我炼出了黄金，”副主教好象在考虑什么似的慢吞吞地字斟句酌地回答，“那么法兰西国王就会是克洛德而不是路易了。”</p> 
<p>长老皱了一下眉头。</p> 
<p>“我刚才说了些什么？”堂·克洛德不在乎地笑了一笑说，“当我能够重建东方帝国的时候，法兰西王位对我有什么用处？”</p> 
<p>“好极了！”长老说。</p> 
<p>“啊，可怜的疯子！”夸克纪埃喃喃低语道。</p> 
<p>副主教继续谈下去，好象仅仅是为了回答自己的问话。</p> 
<p>“可是不，我还得爬行，还得在地狱的路上擦破我的脸和膝盖。我进去了，我只是隐约看见，而不是凝视。我不会阅读，却只会拼音。”</p> 
<p>“到你会读的时候，”长老问道，“你就能炼成黄金吗？”</p> 
<p>“谁会怀疑这个呢？”</p> 
<p>“情况是这样的，圣母知道我十分需要钱财。我很想阅读你那些书。请告诉我，尊敬的阁下，您的科学是不是圣母所反对的或者不喜欢的呢？”</p> 
<p>对于长老提出的这个问题，克洛德乐意用平静高傲的语气回答：“我是属于谁的副主教呀？”</p> 
<p>“那是当然的，我的阁下。好哇，您高兴把奥妙传授给我吗？让我同你一道拼读吧。”</p> 
<p>克洛德作了一个庄严神圣的姿态，好象沙米埃尔似的。</p> 
<p>“老先生，做一次通过这类神秘事物的旅行，需要很多年月呢，您剩下的年月已经不够了！您的头发已经很白啦！人们从那个地窖里出来时已经满头白发，但是进去的时候必须是满头黑发才行呢。科学本身就足以使人们面容消瘦枯槁和烙印重重，它不需要那些由衰老带来的皱巴巴的脸孔。不过，假若您在这样一把年纪，还具有让自己受教育和辨认讨厌的字母表的志愿，那就来找我吧。很好，我可以试一试。对于您这样不幸的老年人，我不会叫您去拜访古代艾阿朵居斯讲起过的那些金字塔的墓室，也不叫你去拜访巴比伦砖砌的高塔，也不叫您去拜访艾克林加印度神庙里白色大理石的神殿。我也跟您一样，没有看见过仿照塞克拉的神圣式样修筑的迦勒底的泥水工程，也没有看见过如今早已倒塌的所罗门神庙，也没有看见过以色列国王墓园残破的大门。我们要一块儿去瞻仰就在我们手边的艾尔美斯的著作的片断，我要给您讲克利斯朵夫的塑像，他是播种者的象征，也要给您讲圣礼拜堂拱门上的两位天使，一位天使的手插在一只瓶里，一位天使的手伸在一片云里……”</p> 
<p>说到这里，被副主教热烈的答辩打下了马的夸克纪埃重新上马了，他用一位学者纠正另一位学者的胜利的口气插话道：“喂，克洛德好友，象征并不是数字。您错把俄耳甫斯当成艾尔美斯了。”</p> 
<p>“那是您弄错了，”副主教认真地回答道，“代达罗斯是地基，俄耳甫斯是墙壁，而艾尔美斯则是那座建筑物本身。整个情况就是这样。您愿意来的时候就请来吧，”他转身向杜韩若说下去，“我要让您看看埋在尼古拉·弗拉梅尔坟墓底下的一部分黄金，您可以把它同巴黎的居约姆的黄金比较一下。我要教给你‘柏里斯特拉’这个希腊词的神秘的含义，但是在一切之先，我要让您去挨个阅读那本书的大理石字母和花岗石篇页。我们要从居约姆主教的大门道、圣若望圆形礼拜堂一直走到马里沃街上尼古拉·弗拉梅尔的房子里去，到圣婴公墓他的坟墓上去，到蒙莫昂塞街他的两座医院去。我要让您去读铁器厂街圣热尔韦医院大门上的象形文字，这座大门是四角包铁的。</p> 
<p>我们还要在一起拼读圣果姆教堂、圣热纳维埃夫·代·阿尔当教堂、圣马尔丹教堂、圣雅克·德·拉·布谢里教堂的前墙……”</p> 
<p>眼光十分敏锐的杜韩若好象已经有好大一会儿弄不清堂克洛德的话是什么意思了，便打岔道：“哎呀！那么您说的究竟是些什么书呀？”</p> 
<p>“这里就有一本。”副主教说。</p> 
<p>他一面打开密室的窗户，一面用指头指着圣母院这座大教堂，它那两座巨大钟塔的石头外墙和那庞大下部的黑黑轮廓高耸在满是星星的夜空里，好象是一个两个脑袋的斯芬克司坐在城市的中央。</p> 
<p>副主教不声不响地观看了一会这座大教堂，接着叹了一口气，右手指着那本打开在台子上的书，左手指着圣母院，把忧郁的眼光从书本移向教堂：“唉！这个要消灭那个的！”</p> 
<p>急忙走到那本书跟前的夸克纪埃禁不住嚷道：“不过，哎——这儿这些字有什么可怕的呢？‘《圣保罗书札评注》，纽伦堡，安东尼奥·科布尔格尔，一四七四年出版’。这并不是新书，这是格言大师比埃尔·伦巴第的著作呀！是不是因为它是印刷的？”</p> 
<p>“您说对了。”克洛德回答道。他好象沉入了一种深深的冥想，挺直地站在那儿，把他的食指弯着放在著名的纽伦堡印刷的那本对折本的书上，继续讲出这些神秘的话：“唉！唉！有些小事往往变成大事：一颗牙齿会战胜一块岩石，一只尼罗河的老鼠会杀掉一条鳄鱼，一把带柄的剑会杀掉一条鲸鱼。这本书要消灭这座教堂！”</p> 
<p>雅克医生用极低的声音向他的同伴重复地讲那句老话：“他是个疯子。”</p> 
<p>这回他的同伴也回答道：“我想是这样的。”正在这时，修道院的灭灯钟响了。</p> 
<p>这个时辰，任何外人都不能再停留在修道院里了。两位客人起身告辞。</p> 
<p>“阁下，”杜韩若向副主教告别时说道，“我是热爱学者和那些伟大的心灵的，我对您尤其尊重。明天请到杜尔内尔宫去，找圣马尔丹·德·杜尔修道院的院长。”</p> 
<p>惊呆了的副主教回到自己屋里，他记起了圣马尔丹·德·杜尔修道院记事册里的条文：“圣马尔丹修道院的院长，就是法兰西国王，他象圣沃南提斯一样，享有小额薪俸，并且主掌教堂的宝库。”他终于明白那个杜韩若长老是什么人物了。</p> 
<p>人们断定就是从这个时候开始，每当路易十一国王陛下来到巴黎，就经常召副主教去商量事情，并且他对克洛德的信任超过了他对奥里维·勒丹以及对雅克·夸克纪埃的信任，而后者便用自己的办法来对付国王。</p>
