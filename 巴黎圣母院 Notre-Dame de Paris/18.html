<p>He belonged to one of those middle-class families which were called indifferently, in the impertinent language of the last century, the high ~bourgeoise~ or the petty nobility. This family had inherited from the brothers Paclet the fief of Tirechappe, which was dependent upon the Bishop of Paris, and whose twenty-one houses had been in the thirteenth century the object of so many suits before the official. As possessor of this fief, Claude Frollo was one of the twenty-seven seigneurs keeping claim to a manor in fee in Paris and its suburbs; and for a long time, his name was to be seen inscribed in this quality, between the H?tel de Tancarville, belonging to Master Fran?ois Le Rez, and the college of Tours, in the records deposited at Saint Martin des Champs.</p> 
<p>Claude Frollo had been destined from infancy, by his parents, to the ecclesiastical profession. He had been taught to read in Latin; he had been trained to keep his eyes on the ground and to speak low. While still a child, his father had cloistered him in the college of Torchi in the University. There it was that he had grown up, on the missal and the lexicon.</p> 
<p>Moreover, he was a sad, grave, serious child, who studied ardently, and learned quickly; he never uttered a loud cry in recreation hour, mixed but little in the bacchanals of the Rue du Fouarre, did not know what it was to ~dare alapas et capillos laniare~, and had cut no figure in that revolt of 1463, which the annalists register gravely, under the title of "The sixth trouble of the University." He seldom rallied the poor students of Montaigu on the ~cappettes~ from which they derived their name, or the bursars of the college of Dormans on their shaved tonsure, and their surtout parti-colored of bluish-green, blue, and violet cloth, ~azurini coloris et bruni~, as says the charter of the Cardinal des Quatre-Couronnes.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, he was assiduous at the great and the small schools of the Rue Saint Jean de Beauvais. The first pupil whom the Abbé de Saint Pierre de Val, at the moment of beginning his reading on canon law, always perceived, glued to a pillar of the school Saint-Vendregesile, opposite his rostrum, was Claude Frollo, armed with his horn ink-bottle, biting his pen, scribbling on his threadbare knee, and, in winter, blowing on his fingers. The first auditor whom Messire Miles d'Isliers, doctor in decretals, saw arrive every Monday morning, all breathless, at the opening of the gates of the school of the Chef-Saint-Denis, was Claude Frollo. Thus, at sixteen years of age, the young clerk might have held his own, in mystical theology, against a father of the church; in canonical theology, against a father of the councils; in scholastic theology, against a doctor of Sorbonne.</p> 
<p>Theology conquered, he had plunged into decretals. From the "Master of Sentences," he had passed to the "Capitularies of Charlemagne;" and he had devoured in succession, in his appetite for science, decretals upon decretals, those of Theodore, Bishop of Hispalus; those of Bouchard, Bishop of Worms; those of Yves, Bishop of Chartres; next the decretal of Gratian, which succeeded the capitularies of Charlemagne; then the collection of Gregory IX.; then the Epistle of ~Superspecula~, of Honorius III. He rendered clear and familiar to himself that vast and tumultuous period of civil law and canon law in conflict and at strife with each other, in the chaos of the Middle Ages,--a period which Bishop Theodore opens in 618, and which Pope Gregory closes in 1227.</p> 
<p>Decretals digested, he flung himself upon medicine, on the liberal arts. He studied the science of herbs, the science of unguents; he became an expert in fevers and in contusions, in sprains and abcesses. Jacques d' Espars would have received him as a physician; Richard Hellain, as a surgeon. He also passed through all the degrees of licentiate, master, and doctor of arts. He studied the languages, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, a triple sanctuary then very little frequented. His was a veritable fever for acquiring and hoarding, in the matter of science. At the age of eighteen, he had made his way through the four faculties; it seemed to the young man that life had but one sole object: learning.</p> 
<p>It was towards this epoch, that the excessive heat of the summer of 1466 caused that grand outburst of the plague which carried off more than forty thousand souls in the vicomty of Paris, and among others, as Jean de Troyes states, "Master Arnoul, astrologer to the king, who was a very fine man, both wise and pleasant." The rumor spread in the University that the Rue Tirechappe was especially devastated by the malady. It was there that Claude's parents resided, in the midst of their fief. The young scholar rushed in great alarm to the paternal mansion. When he entered it, he found that both father and mother had died on the preceding day. A very young brother of his, who was in swaddling clothes, was still alive and crying abandoned in his cradle. This was all that remained to Claude of his family; the young man took the child under his arm and went off in a pensive mood. Up to that moment, he had lived only in science; he now began to live in life.</p> 
<p>This catastrophe was a crisis in Claude's existence. Orphaned, the eldest, head of the family at the age of nineteen, he felt himself rudely recalled from the reveries of school to the realities of this world. Then, moved with pity, he was seized with passion and devotion towards that child, his brother; a sweet and strange thing was a human affection to him, who had hitherto loved his books alone.</p> 
<p>This affection developed to a singular point; in a soul so new, it was like a first love. Separated since infancy from his parents, whom he had hardly known; cloistered and immured, as it were, in his books; eager above all things to study and to learn; exclusively attentive up to that time, to his intelligence which broadened in science, to his imagination, which expanded in letters,--the poor scholar had not yet had time to feel the place of his heart.</p> 
<p>This young brother, without mother or father, this little child which had fallen abruptly from heaven into his arms, made a new man of him. He perceived that there was something else in the world besides the speculations of the Sorbonne, and the verses of Homer; that man needed affections; that life without tenderness and without love was only a set of dry, shrieking, and rending wheels. Only, he imagined, for he was at the age when illusions are as yet replaced only by illusions, that the affections of blood and family were the sole ones necessary, and that a little brother to love sufficed to fill an entire existence.</p> 
<p>He threw himself, therefore, into the love for his little Jehan with the passion of a character already profound, ardent, concentrated; that poor frail creature, pretty, fair- haired, rosy, and curly,--that orphan with another orphan for his only support, touched him to the bottom of his heart; and grave thinker as he was, he set to meditating upon Jehan with an infinite compassion. He kept watch and ward over him as over something very fragile, and very worthy of care. He was more than a brother to the child; he became a mother to him.</p> 
<p>Little Jehan had lost his mother while he was still at the breast; Claude gave him to a nurse. Besides the fief of Tirechappe, he had inherited from his father the fief of Moulin, which was a dependency of the square tower of Gentilly; it was a mill on a hill, near the chateau of Winchestre (Bicêtre). There was a miller's wife there who was nursing a fine child; it was not far from the university, and Claude carried the little Jehan to her in his own arms.</p> 
<p>From that time forth, feeling that he had a burden to bear, he took life very seriously. The thought of his little brother became not only his recreation, but the object of his studies. He resolved to consecrate himself entirely to a future for which he was responsible in the sight of God, and never to have any other wife, any other child than the happiness and fortune of his brother. Therefore, he attached himself more closely than ever to the clerical profession. His merits, his learning, his quality of immediate vassal of the Bishop of Paris, threw the doors of the church wide open to him. At the age of twenty, by special dispensation of the Holy See, he was a priest, and served as the youngest of the chaplains of Notre-Dame the altar which is called, because of the late mass which is said there, ~altare pigrorum~.</p> 
<p>There, plunged more deeply than ever in his dear books, which he quitted only to run for an hour to the fief of Moulin, this mixture of learning and austerity, so rare at his age, had promptly acquired for him the respect and admiration of the monastery. From the cloister, his reputation as a learned man had passed to the people, among whom it had changed a little, a frequent occurrence at that time, into reputation as a sorcerer.</p> 
<p>It was at the moment when he was returning, on Quasimodo day, from saying his mass at the Altar of the Lazy, which was by the side of the door leading to the nave on the right, near the image of the Virgin, that his attention had been attracted by the group of old women chattering around the bed for foundlings.</p> 
<p>Then it was that he approached the unhappy little creature, which was so hated and so menaced. That distress, that deformity, that abandonment, the thought of his young brother, the idea which suddenly occurred to him, that if he were to die, his dear little Jehan might also be flung miserably on the plank for foundlings,--all this had gone to his heart simultaneously; a great pity had moved in him, and he had carried off the child.</p> 
<p>When he removed the child from the sack, he found it greatly deformed, in very sooth. The poor little wretch had a wart on his left eye, his head placed directly on his shoulders, his spinal column was crooked, his breast bone prominent, and his legs bowed; but he appeared to be lively; and although it was impossible to say in what language he lisped, his cry indicated considerable force and health. Claude's compassion increased at the sight of this ugliness; and he made a vow in his heart to rear the child for the love of his brother, in order that, whatever might be the future faults of the little Jehan, he should have beside him that charity done for his sake. It was a sort of investment of good works, which he was effecting in the name of his young brother; it was a stock of good works which he wished to amass in advance for him, in case the little rogue should some day find himself short of that coin, the only sort which is received at the toll-bar of paradise.</p> 
<p>He baptized his adopted child, and gave him the name of Quasimodo, either because he desired thereby to mark the day, when he had found him, or because he wished to designate by that name to what a degree the poor little creature was incomplete, and hardly sketched out. In fact, Quasimodo, blind, hunchbacked, knock-kneed, was only an "almost."</p>

<p>克洛德·孚罗洛确实不是一个村野之辈。</p> 
<p>他属于我们近代语言称之为高等市民或小贵族的中产家庭。这个家庭从巴克雷的修士那里继承了蒂尔夏浦封邑，属巴黎主教管辖，有二十一栋从十三世纪以来不断引起法律纠纷的房子。作为这个封邑领主的克洛德·孚罗洛，是一百四十一位要求在巴黎及其近郊享有领主权益的贵族之一，人们早就看见他的名字为此登记在唐加维尔大厦（那是法朗索瓦·勒芮阁下的产业）和杜尔学院之间的郊区圣马尔丹教堂的簿册里。</p> 
<p>还在童年时期克洛德·孚罗洛的父母就决定要他从事圣职，他们教他学拉丁文，他学会了低头走路和低声讲话。当他还是一个孩子的时候，他的父亲就把他送到大学区的朵尔西神学院去当修道士，他就在那里，在弥撒书和辞典中长大起来。</p> 
<p>他是一个忧郁、认真、严肃的孩子，学习很勤奋，领悟很快。课间休息的时候，他从不大声叫嚷，他很少同孚瓦尔街的酒徒们混在一起，不懂得“打人家耳光和相互揪头发”，没有在一四六三年的暴动中露过面，编年史家们把那次暴动称为“大学区的第六次骚乱”。他很少欺侮蒙塔居绰号“小东西”</p> 
<p>的穷学生，或是那些穿着灰蓝紫（就象四重冠冕的红衣主教的公约里所说的“蔚蓝色和褐色”）三色制服的多尔芒学院的公费生。</p> 
<p>而且他孜孜不倦地到若望·德·波维街的那些大大小小的学校去听课。</p> 
<p>当时第一流的学者，圣比埃尔·德·瓦尔神甫开讲宗教法规时，从正对着他的坐椅的柱子空当里经常看见的第一个学生，便是克洛德·孚罗洛。他拿着墨水瓶，咬着笔杆，伏在已经磨损的裤子膝盖上写着，假若是在冬天，他还不断向手指头上呵气。每星期一的早晨，在歇甫·圣德尼学校刚开大门的时候，神学博士米尔斯·底斯里耶先生看见气喘吁吁地跑来的第一个听众，便是克罗德·孚罗洛。因此，在十六岁上，这个青年教士在神学方面就已经比得上一位教堂的神甫，在经学方面已经比得上一位议会里的神甫，在教育学方面已经比得上一位索邦神学院的博士了。</p> 
<p>学完了这些学科，他又攻读法典。他从《格言大师传》读到《查理曼法规》。由于狂热的求知欲，他贪婪地接连阅读了教令，如伊斯巴尔的主教代阿朵尔，渥尔姆的主教布夏尔以及夏尔特尔的主教伊乌文三人的教令，接着又读了教皇格雷果瓦九世的选集，接着又读了俄诺雅三世的书札《在思辩之上》。他明白了，熟悉了平民法和宗教法在中世纪的混乱状态里苦苦挣扎的那个漫长而复杂的时期，即从六一八年代阿桑尔主教开始到一二二七年格雷果瓦教皇为止的那段时期。</p> 
<p>攻完法规，他又致力于医学和自由学科，他研究了草药学、膏药学，他善于治疗寒热病、跌打损伤和疮毒等等病症。雅克·代斯巴尔夸他是内科医生，理夏尔·艾兰夸他是外科医生。他经历了成为学士、教师和各种学术大师的每一个阶段。他学习了各种文字：拉丁文、希腊文、希伯来文─—这三座圣殿当时是很少有人能够踏进去的。他用一种真正的狂热去获得和积累这些学问，到了十八岁，他已经精通了四种学科，对于这个年轻人来说，好象生活的唯一目的就是学习。</p> 
<p>大约就在那个时期，一四六六年夏季异常的炎热招来了一场大瘟疫，它在巴黎子爵领地夺去了四万多人的生命，据若望·德·特渥依斯所说，其中就有“国王的星象家阿尔努尔先生，一个诚实、聪明、和蔼的人”。大学区里传说蒂尔夏浦街是瘟疫最猖狂的地带，克洛德的父母正是住在他们领地中心的那条街上。那青年学者十分惊骇地跑回父母家去，他一进门就发现父母都已经在头一天晚上死去了，只有一个襁褓中的小弟弟还活着，独自在摇篮里啼哭，那是克洛德的家庭留给他的唯一亲人。年轻人把孩子抱在怀里，若有所思地走出家门，直到那时他都是生活在科学里，此刻才开始到人生中来生活。</p> 
<p>这个变故是克洛德一生的一个转折点。作为一个孤儿，一个长子，一个十九岁的家长，他忽然从学校的梦里被召回到现实的世界里来了。于是，被怜悯激动着，他开始爱怜地专心抚养那个小孩，他的弟弟，这个除了书本之外还没有爱过谁的人，从此竟有了一种奇怪而甜蜜的人的感情。</p> 
<p>这种感情发展到了奇特的地步，在一个这么新鲜的灵魂里，这种感情就象初恋一般。他小时刚记事就离开他的父母，当了修道士，被关闭在书斋里狂热地学习一切和研究一切，直到那时为止他一直专注于他那研究科学而发展起来的理解力和日益增长的文学方面的想象力，这位可怜的学者还没有时间去感觉他的心的存在。这个没有父母的小兄弟，这个小孩儿，突然从天上掉进了他的怀抱，使他变成了一个新人。他明白了世界上除开索邦神学院的理论与荷马的诗歌之外还有别的东西。他明白了人是需要感情的，他知道没有温情，没有爱的生命，就象一个干燥的车轮，转动时格轧格轧地乱响。因为他正处在幻想一个个接连不断的那种年纪，便以为只要有来自家族和血统的感情就够了，只要爱一个小兄弟就足够充实他的一生了。</p> 
<p>他的性格本来就已经十分深刻、虔诚、专注，现在又被这种狂热推动着，使他投身于对小兄弟的热爱之中。那可怜的美丽的粉红色的小生物，那只有另一个孤儿做依靠的孤儿，使他心灵深处深受感动。由于他是个深思熟虑的人，他便以无限的爱怜去看待小若望，给他一切可能的关注和爱护，仿佛他是什么异常精致异常珍贵的东西似的。他对于那孩子不仅是一位兄长，简直变成了那孩子的母亲。</p> 
<p>小若望还没有断奶就失去了母亲。克洛德把他交给奶妈喂养。除了蒂尔夏浦那个领地之外，他还从父亲那里承继了一座附属于让第耶的方形堡的磨坊。那磨坊在一个靠近文歇斯特（比赛特）的小山岗上。磨坊的女主人正奶着一个漂亮的孩子，那地方离大学区并不算远，克洛德便亲自把小若望送去给她哺养。</p> 
<p>从那时起，他觉得肩负起一个重大的责任，便生活得更严肃了。对小兄弟的思念，不仅成为他的安慰，而且是他研究学问的动力。他决心把自己发誓奉献给上帝的全部热忱用来照顾小兄弟，他没有别的伴侣，别的孩子，只有小兄弟的快乐与幸福，于是他比以前更加专心从事他的宗教职务。他的才能，他的博学，他那巴黎主教家臣的身分，使每座教堂都向他敞开大门。到了二十岁，由于罗马教廷的特别许可，他当上了神甫，并且由于他是圣母院神甫群中最年轻的一个，他还执掌那个据说因为弥撒举行得很晚而称为“懒圣坛”的圣坛所的职务。</p> 
<p>他在那里更加埋头在心爱的书堆里面，除了跑到磨坊奶妈那儿去一个钟头之外，他一步也不离开。这种如今罕见的求知欲与修炼的结果，使他很快就在修道院里引起敬仰和尊崇。他博学的名声从修道院传到了群众中，和当时常有的情形一样，他的名声在群众中竟变成了“巫师”的称号。</p> 
<p>复活节后第一个星期天，他在那个“懒圣坛”给懒人们念过弥撒后正往回走（圣坛就在本堂右侧的唱诗室的门边靠近圣母像的地方），围着放弃儿木榻聊天的老妇人的谈话引起了他的注意。</p> 
<p>于是他走到那十分可怕可厌的不幸的小东西跟前，那种惨状，那种畸形，那种被抛弃的身世，使他想起了自己的弟弟，心里突然闪出一个念头：假若他自己死了，他亲爱的小若望也会同样悲惨地给扔到那只放弃儿的木榻上去。这些都一下子来到他的心头，于是他心里突然感到一种极大的悲悯，就把那个弃儿领走了。</p> 
<p>他把那孩子从麻袋里抱出来的时候，发现他的确是难看极了，那可怜的小东西左眼上长着一个肉瘤，脑袋缩在两肩当中，背是驼的，胸骨凸起，双腿蜷曲，但是显得很有生气。虽然没法弄清楚他嘴里嘟嘟嚷嚷讲的是哪一种语言，他的哭声却表现出几分健康和精力。</p> 
<p>这种丑陋越发激起了克洛德的同情，他在心里发誓，为了对小兄弟的爱，他一定要把这孩子抚养成人，将来小若望万一犯了什么罪过，也可以用这桩为了他才做的善事来补偿。这是他用他弟弟的名义贮备的一桩功德，这是他打算为弟弟事先积蓄的一件好货物，因为他担心小家伙有一天会发现自己短少那种资财——那种通过去天堂的关卡时要缴纳的唯一的资财。</p> 
<p>他给他的养子受了洗，取名叫伽西莫多，也许他是想纪念收养那孩子的日期，也许他是想用这个名字来表示可怜的小生物是何等残废而且发育不全。真的，独眼、驼背、罗圈腿的伽西莫多只能说是勉强有个人样儿。</p>
