<p>It is not that Pierre Gringoire either feared or disdained monsieur the cardinal. He had neither the weakness nor the audacity for that. A true eclectic, as it would be expressed nowadays, Gringoire was one of those firm and lofty, moderate and calm spirits, which always know how to bear themselves amid all circumstances (~stare in dimidio rerum~), and who are full of reason and of liberal philosophy, while still setting store by cardinals. A rare, precious, and never interrupted race of philosophers to whom wisdom, like another Ariadne, seems to have given a clew of thread which they have been walking along unwinding since the beginning of the world, through the labyrinth of human affairs. One finds them in all ages, ever the same; that is to say, always according to all times. And, without reckoning our Pierre Gringoire, who may represent them in the fifteenth century if we succeed in bestowing upon him the distinction which he deserves, it certainly was their spirit which animated Father du Breul, when he wrote, in the sixteenth, these naively sublime words, worthy of all centuries: "I am a Parisian by nation, and a Parrhisian in language, for ~parrhisia~ in Greek signifies liberty of speech; of which I have made use even towards messeigneurs the cardinals, uncle and brother to Monsieur the Prince de Conty, always with respect to their greatness, and without offending any one of their suite, which is much to say."</p> 
<p>There was then neither hatred for the cardinal, nor disdain for his presence, in the disagreeable impression produced upon Pierre Gringoire. Quite the contrary; our poet had too much good sense and too threadbare a coat, not to attach particular importance to having the numerous allusions in his prologue, and, in particular, the glorification of the dauphin, son of the Lion of France, fall upon the most eminent ear. But it is not interest which predominates in the noble nature of poets. I suppose that the entity of the poet may be represented by the number ten; it is certain that a chemist on analyzing and pharmacopolizing it, as Rabelais says, would find it composed of one part interest to nine parts of self-esteem.</p> 
<p>Now, at the moment when the door had opened to admit the cardinal, the nine parts of self-esteem in Gringoire, swollen and expanded by the breath of popular admiration, were in a state of prodigious augmentation, beneath which disappeared, as though stifled, that imperceptible molecule of which we have just remarked upon in the constitution of poets; a precious ingredient, by the way, a ballast of reality and humanity, without which they would not touch the earth. Gringoire enjoyed seeing, feeling, fingering, so to speak an entire assembly (of knaves, it is true, but what matters that ?) stupefied, petrified, and as though asphyxiated in the presence of the incommensurable tirades which welled up every instant from all parts of his bridal song. I affirm that he shared the general beatitude, and that, quite the reverse of La Fontaine, who, at the presentation of his comedy of the "Florentine," asked, "Who is the ill-bred lout who made that rhapsody?" Gringoire would gladly have inquired of his neighbor, "Whose masterpiece is this?"</p> 
<p>The reader can now judge of the effect produced upon him by the abrupt and unseasonable arrival of the cardinal.</p> 
<p>That which he had to fear was only too fully realized. The entrance of his eminence upset the audience. All heads turned towards the gallery. It was no longer possible to hear one's self. "The cardinal! The cardinal!" repeated all mouths. The unhappy prologue stopped short for the second time.</p> 
<p>The cardinal halted for a moment on the threshold of the estrade. While he was sending a rather indifferent glance around the audience, the tumult redoubled. Each person wished to get a better view of him. Each man vied with the other in thrusting his head over his neighbor's shoulder.</p> 
<p>He was, in fact, an exalted personage, the sight of whom was well worth any other comedy. Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon, Archbishop and Comte of Lyon, Primate of the Gauls, was allied both to Louis XI., through his brother, Pierre, Seigneur de Beaujeu, who had married the king's eldest daughter, and to Charles the Bold through his mother, Agnes of Burgundy. Now, the dominating trait, the peculiar and distinctive trait of the character of the Primate of the Gauls, was the spirit of the courtier, and devotion to the powers that be. The reader can form an idea of the numberless embarrassments which this double relationship had caused him, and of all the temporal reefs among which his spiritual bark had been forced to tack, in order not to suffer shipwreck on either Louis or Charles, that Scylla and that Charybdis which had devoured the Duc de Nemours and the Constable de Saint-Pol. Thanks to Heaven's mercy, he had made the voyage successfully, and had reached home without hindrance. But although he was in port, and precisely because he was in port, he never recalled without disquiet the varied haps of his political career, so long uneasy and laborious. Thus, he was in the habit of saying that the year 1476 had been "white and black" for him--meaning thereby, that in the course of that year he had lost his mother, the Duchesse de la Bourbonnais, and his cousin, the Duke of Burgundy, and that one grief had consoled him for the other.</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, he was a fine man; he led a joyous cardinal's life, liked to enliven himself with the royal vintage of Challuau, did not hate Richarde la Garmoise and Thomasse la Saillarde, bestowed alms on pretty girls rather than on old women,--and for all these reasons was very agreeable to the populace of Paris. He never went about otherwise than surrounded by a small court of bishops and abbés of high lineage, gallant, jovial, and given to carousing on occasion; and more than once the good and devout women of Saint Germain d' Auxerre, when passing at night beneath the brightly illuminated windows of Bourbon, had been scandalized to hear the same voices which had intoned vespers for them during the day carolling, to the clinking of glasses, the bacchic proverb of Benedict XII., that pope who had added a third crown to the Tiara--~Bibamus papaliter~.</p> 
<p>It was this justly acquired popularity, no doubt, which preserved him on his entrance from any bad reception at the hands of the mob, which had been so displeased but a moment before, and very little disposed to respect a cardinal on the very day when it was to elect a pope. But the Parisians cherish little rancor; and then, having forced the beginning of the play by their authority, the good bourgeois had got the upper hand of the cardinal, and this triumph was sufficient for them. Moreover, the Cardinal de Bourbon was a handsome man,--he wore a fine scarlet robe, which he carried off very well,--that is to say, he had all the women on his side, and, consequently, the best half of the audience. Assuredly, it would be injustice and bad taste to hoot a cardinal for having come late to the spectacle, when he is a handsome man, and when he wears his scarlet robe well.</p> 
<p>He entered, then, bowed to those present with the hereditary smile of the great for the people, and directed his course slowly towards his scarlet velvet arm-chair, with the air of thinking of something quite different. His cortege--what we should nowadays call his staff--of bishops and abbés invaded the estrade in his train, not without causing redoubled tumult and curiosity among the audience. Each man vied with his neighbor in pointing them out and naming them, in seeing who should recognize at least one of them: this one, the Bishop of Marseilles (Alaudet, if my memory serves me right);--this one, the primicier of Saint-Denis;--this one, Robert de Lespinasse, Abbé of Saint-Germain des Prés, that libertine brother of a mistress of Louis XI.; all with many errors and absurdities. As for the scholars, they swore. This was their day, their feast of fools, their saturnalia, the annual orgy of the corporation of Law clerks and of the school. There was no turpitude which was not sacred on that day. And then there were gay gossips in the crowd--Simone Quatrelivres, Agnes la Gadine, and Rabine Piédebou. Was it not the least that one could do to swear at one's ease and revile the name of God a little, on so fine a day, in such good company as dignitaries of the church and loose women? So they did not abstain; and, in the midst of the uproar, there was a frightful concert of blasphemies and enormities of all the unbridled tongues, the tongues of clerks and students restrained during the rest of the year, by the fear of the hot iron of Saint Louis. Poor Saint Louis! how they set him at defiance in his own court of law! Each one of them selected from the new-comers on the platform, a black, gray, white, or violet cassock as his target. Joannes Frollo de Molendin, in his quality of brother to an archdeacon, boldly attacked the scarlet; he sang in deafening tones, with his impudent eyes fastened on the cardinal, "~Cappa repleta mero~!"</p> 
<p>All these details which we here lay bare for the edification of the reader, were so covered by the general uproar, that they were lost in it before reaching the reserved platforms; moreover, they would have moved the cardinal but little, so much a part of the customs were the liberties of that day. Moreover, he had another cause for solicitude, and his mien as wholly preoccupied with it, which entered the estrade the same time as himself; this was the embassy from Flanders.</p> 
<p>Not that he was a profound politician, nor was he borrowing trouble about the possible consequences of the marriage of his cousin Marguerite de Bourgoyne to his cousin Charles, Dauphin de Vienne; nor as to how long the good understanding which had been patched up between the Duke of Austria and the King of France would last; nor how the King of England would take this disdain of his daughter. All that troubled him but little; and he gave a warm reception every evening to the wine of the royal vintage of Chaillot, without a suspicion that several flasks of that same wine (somewhat revised and corrected, it is true, by Doctor Coictier), cordially offered to Edward IV. by Louis XI., would, some fine morning, rid Louis XI. of Edward IV. "The much honored embassy of Monsieur the Duke of Austria," brought the cardinal none of these cares, but it troubled him in another direction. It was, in fact, somewhat hard, and we have already hinted at it on the second page of this book,--for him, Charles de Bourbon, to be obliged to feast and receive cordially no one knows what bourgeois;--for him, a cardinal, to receive aldermen;--for him, a Frenchman, and a jolly companion, to receive Flemish beer-drinkers,--and that in public! This was, certainly, one of the most irksome grimaces that he had ever executed for the good pleasure of the king.</p> 
<p>So he turned toward the door, and with the best grace in the world (so well had he trained himself to it), when the usher announced, in a sonorous voice, "Messieurs the Envoys of Monsieur the Duke of Austria." It is useless to add that the whole hall did the same.</p> 
<p>Then arrived, two by two, with a gravity which made a contrast in the midst of the frisky ecclesiastical escort of Charles de Bourbon, the eight and forty ambassadors of Maximilian of Austria, having at their head the reverend Father in God, Jehan, Abbot of Saint-Bertin, Chancellor of the Golden Fleece, and Jacques de Goy, Sieur Dauby, Grand Bailiff of Ghent. A deep silence settled over the assembly, accompanied by stifled laughter at the preposterous names and all the bourgeois designations which each of these personages transmitted with imperturbable gravity to the usher, who then tossed names and titles pell-mell and mutilated to the crowd below. There were Master Loys Roelof, alderman of the city of Louvain; Messire Clays d'Etuelde, alderman of Brussels; Messire Paul de Baeust, Sieur de Voirmizelle, President of Flanders; Master Jehan Coleghens, burgomaster of the city of Antwerp; Master George de la Moere, first alderman of the kuere of the city of Ghent; Master Gheldolf van der Hage, first alderman of the ~parchous~ of the said town; and the Sieur de Bierbecque, and Jehan Pinnock, and Jehan Dymaerzelle, etc., etc., etc.; bailiffs, aldermen, burgomasters; burgomasters, aldermen, bailiffs--all stiff, affectedly grave, formal, dressed out in velvet and damask, hooded with caps of black velvet, with great tufts of Cyprus gold thread; good Flemish heads, after all, severe and worthy faces, of the family which Rembrandt makes to stand out so strong and grave from the black background of his "Night Patrol "; personages all of whom bore, written on their brows, that Maximilian of Austria had done well in "trusting implicitly," as the manifest ran, "in their sense, valor, experience, loyalty, and good wisdom."</p> 
<p>There was one exception, however. It was a subtle, intelligent, crafty-looking face, a sort of combined monkey and diplomat phiz, before whom the cardinal made three steps and a profound bow, and whose name, nevertheless, was only, "Guillaume Rym, counsellor and pensioner of the City of Ghent."</p> 
<p>Few persons were then aware who Guillaume Rym was. A rare genius who in a time of revolution would have made a brilliant appearance on the surface of events, but who in the fifteenth century was reduced to cavernous intrigues, and to "living in mines," as the Duc de Saint-Simon expresses it. Nevertheless, he was appreciated by the "miner" of Europe; he plotted familiarly with Louis XI., and often lent a hand to the king's secret jobs. All which things were quite unknown to that throng, who were amazed at the cardinal's politeness to that frail figure of a Flemish bailiff.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>可怜的甘果瓦！无论是圣·若望的双料大爆竹发出的声响，二十支火绳枪的放射，比里炮塔上著名的古炮的射击（在一四六五年九月二十九日那个巴黎被围的星期天，这种古炮一炮就打死了七个庇卡底人），或者是庙门贮存的弹药的爆炸，在这个庄严的激动人心的时候，都不会象从守门人嘴里说出的“波旁红衣主教大人到” 这几个字那样震动他的耳朵。</p> 
<p>并不是甘果瓦畏惧或者看不起红衣主教，他既没有这种懦弱也没有这种傲慢，用我们现今的话来说，他是那些人里的一个，他们具有高尚、坚决、中庸、温和的精神，永远懂得站在一切的中央，有着满脑子的理智和自由主义的哲学思想，同时又是十分尊敬红衣主教的折衷主义者。哲学家是属于高贵的永不绝灭的种族，象另一位亚里安娜一样，智慧也好象给了他们一团线，使他们从洪荒时代开始，就能顺着线球穿过人类事物的迷宫。在任何时代都可以找到这类人，他们总是一样的，这就是说，他们总是能适应一切时代的，除开我们的甘果瓦不算，假若我们可以把他应得的这份声誉归在他身上的话。他在十五世纪可能是他们的代表。确实是他们的这种精神鼓舞了杜·布厄尔神甫，使他在十六世纪写出了这些永远值得流传下去的话：“我在籍贯上是个巴黎人，说起话来是个自由论者，因为巴黎人这个词在希腊文中就是自由讲话的意思。我甚至把这个词用到红衣主教大人们和太子贡蒂殿下的叔父和弟兄身上，同时对他们的高贵怀着敬意，不得罪他们的任何一位侍从，而他们的侍从相当多呢。”</p> 
<p>那么，使比埃尔·甘果瓦不愉快的，并不是他对于红衣主教的怨恨，也不是轻视他的莅临。正好相反，我们的诗人有着过多的良知和太破的上衣，他并不特别担心他的序幕里隐喻太多，更不怕他对法兰西狮王的称颂会给那高贵的耳朵听见。但是人们高贵的天性中占优势的并不是兴致，我猜想，诗人们的天性可以用“十”这个数字来表现。假若我们让化学家来分析，就象拉伯雷所说，那就一定会发现其中只有十分之一是兴致，而十分之九是自尊心。可是当大门为红衣主教打开的时候，甘果瓦那在一致赞赏的气氛里膨胀起来的十分之九的自尊心，就变成了一种深深的狂热，致使我们刚才在诗人们的天性中指出的那种兴致，仿佛给窒息了似的消失得半点不剩了。此外这一兴致也是一种可贵的组成部分，诗人如缺少这种对现实和人类的感情，便无从和大地建立联系。甘果瓦能高兴地去感到看到和接触到全体观众（其实这是一些无赖），但那又有什么关系呢？他们好象被贺婚诗里到处出现的长篇大论窒息了，惊呆了。我敢断定他自己也分享着观众的这份福气，他可不象拉封丹在自己的喜剧《佛罗伦斯人》首次公演时问道：“这狂乱的诗章是哪个低劣的作者写的？”甘果瓦倒很想问问他身边的人：“这是谁的杰作？”</p> 
<p>现在你可以想象红衣主教的突然到来对他产生了什么影响了。</p> 
<p>他很有理由担心发生的事，却过早地发生了。红衣主教阁下的进场使观众的情绪激动起来，所有的脑袋都朝看台转过去。听不见别的，只听见大家重复地喊：“红衣主教！红衣主教！”不幸的序幕又一次被打断了。</p> 
<p>红衣主教在看台的门槛上停留了一会，他相当傲慢地朝观众看了一眼，吵嚷声就更厉害起来。每一个人都希望更清楚地看到他，都把头抬得比旁边的人更高些，都朝他看着。</p> 
<p>他的确是一位出众的人物，看他比看任何喜剧都值得。查理是波旁的红衣主教，里昂的大主教和伯爵，高卢的首席主教，他还因为哥哥——波热的贵族比埃尔——娶了路易十一的长女，而和国王有了姻戚关系。又因他母亲阿涅丝·德·勃艮第，使他又和勇敢的查理有姻戚关系。这位高卢的首席主教性格里的鲜明特点，就是具有弄臣的精神和对于权势的虔敬。为了使自己不至于同路易或查理弄得关系破裂——这种关系很象曾经使纳姆公爵和圣波尔元帅覆没的沙西德漩涡与锡拉岩礁一样——，你就可以想象出这双重关系给予他的无数阻碍，以及他的精神的船只必须从其间通过的那些岩礁了。</p> 
<p>谢天谢地，他总算免于覆没，一无阻碍地到达了罗马。他虽然已经到达港岸，而且正因为已经在岸上，每当他想起在相当长的政治生活中的种种惊险的遭遇，内心还是不能平静。讲起一四七六年，他照例总是说那对于他是“既白且黑的”，意思是说他在那一年里失去了他的母亲波旁公爵夫人和他的表兄勃艮第公爵，不过这一种哀伤由于另一种而得到了安慰。</p> 
<p>但他是个好人，他愉快地度着他的红衣主教的生涯，喜欢在莎里约王室葡萄园游玩，不憎恨理查德·拉卡尔玛和多玛斯·拉沙雅德，给少女们的布施比给老妇们的多些。由于这一切，他是受巴黎公众欢迎的。红衣主教无论到哪里去，身边总是围绕着一小群血统高贵的主教和神甫，他们都是又文雅又轻佻，而且喜欢宴饮。圣日尔曼·多克塞尔的虔诚信徒们在黄昏时分经过波旁府邸那些灯火辉煌的窗子时，不止一次听见那黄昏前给他们唱晚祷歌的声音混在一阵玻璃杯相碰的声音里，唱着曾经三次加冕的教皇伯努瓦十二世的酒神颂，这使他们非常反感。</p> 
<p>毫无疑问，正是由于他那身分和声名，人们在他进来的时候就把恶意的表示压制住了。他们在一会儿以前还很不高兴，并不认为应当在选举愚人王的日子里对红衣主教表示敬意。但巴黎人是很不善于怀恨的，何况由于权威性的戏剧提前开演了，好心的公民们已经占了红衣主教的上风，这就使他们很满意了。何况波旁的红衣主教先生是一个美男子，很整齐地穿着非常漂亮的红色长袍，这就是说他赢得了全体妇女，也就是一半观众的好感。由于红衣主教在戏演了好一会儿才到场就去责骂他，那可是不妥当的，恶劣的，既然他是一位美男子，而且还端整地穿着他的红袍子。</p> 
<p>他进来了，带着大人物面对公众时照例有的微笑向观众行了礼，慢慢移步走向他那张铺着华丽的天鹅绒的靠椅，神色显得完全心不在焉。在他走上看台的当儿，跟在他身后的随员们，即我们如今称之为智囊团的那些主教和神甫们，更加引起了厅堂里观众的骚动和好奇。每个人都乐于指点他们，说出他们的姓名，他们至少认识其中的一个：那一位是马赛的主教阿罗丹先生，假若我记得不错；那一位是圣德尼的副主教；那一位是圣日尔曼·代·勃雷教堂的神甫罗贝尔·德·内斯比纳斯，路易十一的某个情妇的放荡的兄弟。</p> 
<p>他们说时，差不多全都用的是轻视的口吻和刺耳的声调。至于大学生们，他们是骂声不绝。因为这是他们的日子呀，这是他们的愚人节，是他们纵情狂欢的日子，是大理院书记团和学校一年一度的大摆筵席的日子呀。在这个日子里，任何胡闹都是被允许而且被认为是神圣不可侵犯的。何况这群人中间还有几个愚蠢的饶舌的女人：西蒙娜·加特里芙、阿涅丝·拉加丁和罗宾娜·比埃德布。在这个美妙的日子里，同教会里的人以及荡妇们在一起，他们不是至少可以随便赌咒发誓和骂骂上帝么？在一片嘈杂声中，从那些舌头上滑出了大量可怕的辱骂和谬论，这些青年和大学生的舌头，在一年的其余日子都是害怕圣路易的炮烙酷刑的。倒霉的圣路易！人们在他的司法宫里对他表现出怎样的轻视！看台上其他新到的人，各穿一件灰色、白色或紫色的长袍。</p> 
<p>至于若望·孚罗洛·德·梅朗狄诺，因为他是一位副主教的老弟，就大胆地穿了一件大红色的。他把眼睛盯着红衣主教，用最高的嗓门唱道：“浸透了美酒的袍子呀！”</p> 
<p>我们在此用详细描述来帮助读者了解的这些情景，都被一片喧哗声遮盖着，看台上的人并没有注意到。既然自由行动在这一天照例是被允许的，红衣主教也就不怎么在乎，何况他还有一桩挂心的事儿使他显得心事重重，那就是弗朗德勒的使臣们，他们紧跟在他后面，几乎同他一起来到了看台上。</p> 
<p>他并不是一个城府很深的政治家，他并不考虑他的表妹玛格丽特·德·勃艮第夫人同他的堂兄，维埃纳省的太子查理殿下的婚姻会产生什么后果，或是奥地利公爵同法兰西国王之间的友好关系能维持多久，或是英吉利国王会怎样对待他女儿的傲慢无礼，这些都不怎么令他不安。他每晚享受着莎里约王室葡萄园特产的葡萄酒，从未想到路易十一也会诚恳地赠送给爱德华四世几瓶同样的葡萄酒（当然是先被医生夸克纪埃掺进了药汁的），竟会在一个美好的早晨，使路易十一摆脱了爱德华四世的束缚。“最尊敬的奥地利公爵殿下的使臣们”并未使红衣主教怎么操心，但却在别的方面给他添了麻烦。</p> 
<p>他，查理·德·波旁，他这位红衣主教，他这个法国人，这个酒友，却要热烈欢迎并盛宴招待那些爱喝啤酒的弗朗德勒人，那些资产阶级，那些执政官员（我们已经在前面交待过），而且还是当着公众的面，这实在是有些令他难堪的。的确，这要算是他讨好国王的事情里面最可厌的一种了。</p> 
<p>当守门人用响亮的声音通报：“奥地利公爵殿下的使节们到”，红衣主教就表现出全世界最好的礼貌（对此他是何等的熟悉），朝大门口转过身去。</p> 
<p>不用说，整个大厅的人也跟着守门人喊了一遍。</p> 
<p>奥地利的马克西米良的四十八位使臣并排着双双到来了，他们都很端庄，和跟随查理·德·波旁的那些教会人士截然不同。为首的是圣倍尔丹的副主教，金羊毛法令的掌管人若望神甫和刚城的高等司法官加克·德·柯瓦·多比阁下。全场观众悄悄忍住笑声，听着他们把那些怪诞的名字和不足道的官衔告诉守门人，守门人又把那些名字和官衔胡乱搅混着转报给观众：卢凡市的执政官何埃洛甫阁下，布鲁塞尔城的执政官克雷·代居尔德阁下，弗朗德勒的首脑彼尔·德巴埃斯大人，安维尔市的市政官若望·戈兰阁下，刚城的首席执政官乔治·德·拉莫埃尔阁下和吉尔多甫·封·代尔·阿克阁下，还有比埃倍格先生，若望·比埃克先生，若望·蒂玛耶日尔先生等等，等等。司法官们，执政官们，市政官们；市政官们，执政官们，司法官们。</p> 
<p>全都那么僵硬、古板、迂执，穿着天鹅绒和缎子的节日服装，戴着嵌有大簇西勃尔岛金线的黑天鹅绒帽子。总之，全都是些弗朗德勒的漂亮脑袋，他们庄重而善良的仪表和伦勃朗夜景画里黑色背景上强壮严肃的人物属于同一类型。这些人似乎把一切都写在额头上，正如奥地利的马克西米良在声明书里说的，他有理由“完全相信他们具有审慎、英勇、干练、忠实及其他难得的好品质”。</p> 
<p>可是也有一个人是例外。这个人有一副清秀、聪明、机警的面孔，嘴鼻又象猴子又象外交家。红衣主教在这人面前迈了三步，深深地施了一礼，而他的称呼不过是“刚城的参事和养老金领取人居约姆·韩”。</p> 
<p>很少人知道这位居约姆·韩是什么人。他是一个罕见的天才，在革命时期一定会干得轰轰烈烈，但是在十五世纪，他却不得不采用空洞的阴谋诡计，就象圣西蒙公爵说的“生活在地道里”。他被认为是欧洲第一个挖地道的人，经常替路易十一出谋划策，插手这位国王的一些机密事务。群众根本不知道这些情况，看见红衣主教对这个其貌不扬的弗朗德勒官员表示的那种礼貌，都觉得非常惊奇。</p>
