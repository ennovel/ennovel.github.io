<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he went away from there, and came into his country; and his disciples went with him.
<br>6:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;到 了 安 息 日 ， 他 在 会 堂 里 教 训 人 。 众 人 听 见 ， 就 甚 希 奇 ， 说 ， 这 人 从 哪 里 有 这 些 事 呢 ？ 所 赐 给 他 的 是 什 么 智 慧 ？ 他 手 所 作 的 是 何 等 的 异 能 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the Sabbath day had come, he was teaching in the Synagogue; and a number of people hearing him were surprised, saying, From where did this man get these things? and, What is the wisdom given to this man, and what are these works of power done by his hands?
<br>6:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 不 是 那 木 匠 吗 ？ 不 是 马 利 亚 的 儿 子 ， 雅 各 ， 约 西 ， 犹 大 ， 西 门 的 长 兄 吗 ？ 他 妹 妹 们 不 也 是 在 我 们 这 里 吗 ？ 他 们 就 厌 弃 他 。 （ 厌 弃 他 原 文 作 因 他 跌 倒 ）
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Is not this the woodworker, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were bitter against him.
<br>6:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 大 凡 先 知 ， 除 了 本 地 亲 属 本 家 之 外 ， 没 有 不 被 人 尊 敬 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus said to them, A prophet is nowhere without honour, but in his country, and among his relations, and in his family.
<br>6:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 就 在 那 里 不 得 行 什 么 异 能 ， 不 过 按 手 在 几 个 病 人 身 上 ， 治 好 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he was unable to do any work of power there, but only to put his hands on one or two persons who were ill, and make them well.
<br>6:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 也 诧 异 他 们 不 信 ， 就 往 周 围 乡 村 教 训 人 去 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he was greatly surprised because they had no faith. And he went about the country places teaching.
<br>6:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 叫 了 十 二 个 门 徒 来 ， 差 遣 他 们 两 个 两 个 的 出 去 。 也 赐 给 他 们 权 柄 ， 制 伏 污 鬼 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he gave orders to the twelve, and sent them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits;
<br>6:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;并 且 嘱 咐 他 们 ， 行 路 的 时 候 ， 不 要 带 食 物 和 口 袋 ， 腰 袋 里 也 不 要 带 钱 ， 除 了 拐 杖 以 外 ， 什 么 都 不 要 带 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said that they were to take nothing for their journey, but a stick only; no bread, no bag, no money in their pockets;
<br>6:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;只 要 穿 鞋 。 也 不 要 穿 两 件 挂 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;They were to go with common shoes on their feet, and not to take two coats.
<br>6:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 无 论 到 何 处 ， 进 了 人 的 家 ， 就 住 在 那 里 ， 直 到 离 开 那 地 方 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, Wherever you go into a house, make that your resting-place till you go away.
<br>6:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;何 处 的 人 ， 不 接 待 你 们 ， 不 听 你 们 ， 你 们 离 开 那 里 的 时 候 ， 就 把 脚 上 的 尘 土 跺 下 去 ， 对 他 们 作 见 证 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And whatever place will not take you in and will not give ear to you, when you go away, put off the dust from your feet as a witness against them.
<br>6:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;门 徒 就 出 去 ， 传 道 叫 人 悔 改 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they went out, and preached that men should repent.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they went out, preaching the need for a change of heart in men.
<br>6:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 赶 出 许 多 的 鬼 ， 用 油 抹 了 许 多 病 人 ， 治 好 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they sent out a number of evil spirits, and put oil on a great number who were ill, and made them well.
<br>6:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 的 名 声 传 扬 出 来 。 希 律 王 听 见 了 ， 就 说 ， 施 洗 的 约 翰 从 死 里 复 活 了 ， 所 以 这 些 异 能 由 他 里 面 发 出 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And king Herod had news of him, because his name was on the lips of all; and he said, John the Baptist has come back from the dead, and for this reason these powers are working in him.
<br>6:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 别 人 说 ， 是 以 利 亚 。 又 有 人 说 ， 是 先 知 ， 正 像 先 知 中 的 一 位 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But others said, It is Elijah. And others said, It is a prophet, even like one of the prophets.
<br>6:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;希 律 听 见 ， 却 说 ， 是 我 所 斩 的 约 翰 ， 他 复 活 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Herod, when he had news of it, said, John, whom I put to death, has come back from the dead.
<br>6:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;先 是 希 律 为 他 兄 弟 腓 力 的 妻 子 希 罗 底 的 缘 故 ， 差 人 去 拿 住 约 翰 ， 锁 在 监 里 ， 因 为 希 律 已 经 娶 了 那 妇 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For Herod himself had sent men out to take John and put him in prison, because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had taken for himself.
<br>6:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;约 翰 曾 对 希 律 说 ， 你 娶 你 兄 弟 的 妻 子 是 不 合 理 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For John said to Herod, It is wrong for you to have your brother's wife.
<br>6:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 希 罗 底 怀 恨 他 ， 想 要 杀 他 。 只 是 不 能 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Herodias was bitter against him, desiring to put him to death; but she was not able;
<br>6:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 希 律 知 道 约 翰 是 义 人 ， 是 圣 人 ， 所 以 敬 畏 他 ， 保 护 他 。 听 他 讲 论 ， 就 多 照 着 行 。 并 且 乐 意 听 他 。 （ 多 照 着 行 有 古 卷 作 游 移 不 定 ）
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For Herod was in fear of John, being conscious that he was an upright and holy man, and kept him safe. And hearing him, he was much troubled; and he gave ear to him gladly.
<br>6:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 一 天 ， 恰 巧 是 希 律 的 生 日 ， 希 律 摆 设 筵 席 ， 请 了 大 臣 和 千 夫 长 ， 并 加 利 利 作 首 领 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the chance came when Herod on his birthday gave a feast to his lords, and the high captains, and the chief men of Galilee;
<br>6:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;希 罗 底 的 女 儿 进 来 跳 舞 ， 使 希 律 和 同 席 的 人 都 欢 喜 。 王 就 对 女 子 说 ， 你 随 意 向 我 求 什 么 ， 我 必 给 你 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and did a dance, Herod and those who were at table with him were pleased with her; and the king said to the girl, Make a request for anything and I will give it you.
<br>6:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 对 她 起 誓 说 ， 随 你 向 我 求 什 么 ， 就 是 我 国 的 一 半 ， 我 也 必 给 你 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he took an oath, saying to her, Whatever is your desire I will give it to you, even half of my kingdom.
<br>6:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;她 就 出 去 ， 对 她 母 亲 说 ， 我 可 以 求 什 么 呢 ？ 她 母 亲 说 ， 施 洗 约 翰 的 头 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And she went out and said to her mother, What is my request to be? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.
<br>6:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;她 就 急 忙 进 去 见 王 ， 求 他 说 ， 我 愿 王 立 时 把 施 洗 约 翰 的 头 ， 放 在 盘 子 里 给 我 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And she came in quickly to the king, and said, My desire is that you give me straight away on a plate the head of John the Baptist.
<br>6:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;王 就 甚 忧 愁 。 但 因 他 所 起 的 誓 ， 又 因 同 席 的 人 ， 就 不 肯 推 辞 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the king was very sad; but because of his oaths, and those who were with him at table, he would not say 'No' to her.
<br>6:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;随 即 差 一 个 护 卫 兵 ， 吩 咐 拿 约 翰 的 头 来 。 护 卫 兵 就 去 在 监 里 斩 了 约 翰 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And straight away the king sent out one of his armed men, and gave him an order to come back with the head: and he went and took off John's head in prison,
<br>6:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;把 头 放 在 盘 子 里 ， 拿 来 给 女 子 ， 女 子 就 给 她 母 亲 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And came back with the head on a plate, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother.
<br>6:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;约 翰 的 门 徒 听 见 了 ， 就 来 把 他 的 尸 首 领 去 ， 葬 在 坟 墓 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when his disciples had news of it, they came and took up his body, and put it in its last resting-place.
<br>6:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;使 徒 聚 集 到 耶 稣 那 里 ， 将 一 切 所 作 的 事 ， 所 传 的 道 ， 全 告 诉 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the twelve came together to Jesus; and they gave him an account of all the things they had done, and all they had been teaching.
<br>6:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 就 说 ， 你 们 来 同 我 暗 暗 地 到 旷 野 地 方 去 歇 一 歇 。 这 是 因 为 来 往 的 人 多 ， 他 们 连 吃 饭 也 没 有 工 夫 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, Come away by yourselves to a quiet place, and take a rest for a time. Because there were a great number coming and going, and they had no time even for food.
<br>6:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 就 坐 船 ， 暗 暗 地 往 旷 野 地 方 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they went away in the boat to a waste place by themselves.
<br>6:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 看 见 他 们 去 ， 有 许 多 认 识 他 们 的 ， 就 从 各 城 步 行 ， 一 同 跑 到 那 里 ， 比 他 们 先 赶 到 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the people saw them going, and a number of them, having knowledge who they were, went running there together on foot from all the towns, and got there before them.
<br>6:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 出 来 ， 见 有 许 多 的 人 ， 就 怜 悯 他 们 。 因 为 他 们 如 同 羊 没 有 牧 人 一 般 。 于 是 开 口 教 训 他 们 许 多 道 理 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he got out, and saw a great mass of people, and he had pity on them, because they were like sheep without a keeper: and he gave them teaching about a number of things.
<br>6:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;天 已 经 晚 了 ， 门 徒 进 前 来 说 ， 这 是 野 地 ， 天 已 经 晚 了 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And at the end of the day, his disciples came to him and said, This place is waste land, and it is late:
<br>6:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;请 叫 众 人 散 开 ， 他 们 好 往 四 面 乡 村 里 去 ， 自 己 买 什 么 吃 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Send them away, so that they may go into the country and small towns round about, and get some food for themselves.
<br>6:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 你 们 给 他 们 吃 吧 。 门 徒 说 ， 我 们 可 以 去 买 二 十 两 银 子 的 饼 ， 给 他 们 吃 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But he said to them in answer, Give them food yourselves. And they said to him, Are we to go and get bread for two hundred pence, and give it to them?
<br>6:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 你 们 有 多 少 饼 ， 可 以 去 看 看 。 他 们 知 道 了 ， 就 说 ， 五 个 饼 ， 两 条 鱼 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, How much bread have you? go and see. And when they had seen, they said, Five cakes of bread and two fishes.
<br>6:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 吩 咐 他 们 叫 众 人 一 帮 一 帮 地 坐 在 青 草 地 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he made them all be seated in groups on the green grass.
<br>6:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 就 一 排 一 排 地 坐 下 ， 有 一 百 一 排 的 ， 有 五 十 一 排 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they were placed in groups, by hundreds and by fifties.
<br>6:41&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 拿 着 这 五 个 饼 ， 两 条 鱼 ， 望 着 天 祝 福 ， 掰 开 饼 ， 递 给 门 徒 摆 在 众 人 面 前 。 也 把 那 两 条 鱼 分 给 众 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he took the five cakes of bread and the two fishes and, looking up to heaven, he said words of blessing over them; and when the cakes were broken, he gave them to the disciples to put before the people; and he made division of the two fishes among them all.
<br>6:42&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 都 吃 ， 并 且 吃 饱 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they did all eat, and were filled.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they all took of the food and had enough.
<br>6:43&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;门 徒 就 把 碎 饼 碎 鱼 ， 收 拾 起 来 ， 装 满 了 十 二 个 篮 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken bits and of the fishes.
<br>6:44&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;吃 饼 的 男 人 ， 共 有 五 千 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And those who took of the bread were five thousand men.
<br>6:45&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 随 即 催 门 徒 上 船 ， 先 渡 到 那 边 伯 赛 大 去 ， 等 他 叫 众 人 散 开 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And straight away he made his disciples get into the boat, and go before him to the other side to Beth-saida, while he himself sent the people away.
<br>6:46&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 既 辞 别 了 他 们 ， 就 往 山 上 去 祷 告 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And after he had sent them away, he went up into a mountain for prayer.
<br>6:47&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;到 了 晚 上 ， 船 在 海 中 ， 耶 稣 独 自 在 岸 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And by evening, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he by himself on the land.
<br>6:48&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;看 见 门 徒 ， 因 风 不 顺 ， 摇 橹 甚 苦 。 夜 里 约 有 四 更 天 ， 就 在 海 面 上 走 往 他 们 那 里 去 ， 意 思 要 走 过 他 们 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And seeing that they had trouble in getting their boat through the water, because the wind was against them, about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea; and he would have gone past them;
<br>6:49&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 门 徒 看 见 他 在 海 面 上 走 ， 以 为 是 鬼 怪 ， 就 喊 叫 起 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But they, when they saw him walking on the sea, took him for a spirit, and gave a loud cry:
<br>6:50&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 他 们 都 看 见 了 他 ， 且 甚 惊 慌 。 耶 稣 连 忙 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 放 心 。 是 我 ， 不 要 怕 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For they all saw him, and were troubled. But straight away he said to them, Take heart, it is I, have no fear.
<br>6:51&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 到 他 们 那 里 上 了 船 ， 风 就 住 了 。 他 们 心 里 十 分 惊 奇 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he went to them into the boat, and the wind went down, and they were full of wonder in themselves;
<br>6:52&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 是 因 为 他 们 不 明 白 那 分 饼 的 事 ， 心 里 还 是 愚 顽 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For it was not clear to them about the bread; but their hearts were hard.
<br>6:53&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;既 渡 过 去 ， 来 到 革 尼 撒 勒 地 方 ， 就 靠 了 岸 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when they had gone across, they came to Gennesaret, and got their boat to land.
<br>6:54&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;一 下 船 ， 众 人 认 得 是 耶 稣 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when they had got out of the boat, the people quickly had news of him,
<br>6:55&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 跑 遍 那 一 带 地 方 ， 听 见 他 在 何 处 ， 便 将 有 病 的 人 ， 用 褥 子 抬 到 那 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And went running through all the country round about, and took on their beds those who were ill, to where it was said that he was.
<br>6:56&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;凡 耶 稣 所 到 的 地 方 ， 或 村 中 ， 或 城 里 ， 或 乡 间 ， 他 们 都 将 病 人 放 在 街 市 上 ， 求 耶 稣 只 容 他 们 摸 他 的 衣 裳 ？ ？ 子 。 凡 摸 着 的 人 ， 就 都 好 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And wherever he went, into small towns, or great towns, or into the country, they took those who were ill into the market-places, requesting him that they might put their hands even on the edge of his robe: and all those who did so were made well.
