<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he went again into the Synagogue; and there was a man there whose hand was dead.
<br>3:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 窥 探 耶 稣 ， 在 安 息 日 医 治 不 医 治 ， 意 思 是 要 控 告 耶 稣 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they were watching him to see if he would make him well on the Sabbath day, so that they might have something against him.
<br>3:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 那 枯 干 一 只 手 的 人 说 ， 起 来 ， 站 在 当 中 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to the man, Get up and come forward.
<br>3:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 问 众 人 说 ， 在 安 息 日 行 善 行 恶 ， 救 命 害 命 ， 那 样 是 可 以 的 呢 ？ 他 们 都 不 作 声 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, Is it right to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil? to give life or to put to death? But they said nothing.
<br>3:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 怒 目 周 围 看 他 们 ， 忧 愁 他 们 的 心 刚 硬 ， 就 对 那 人 说 ， 伸 出 手 来 。 他 把 手 一 伸 ， 手 就 复 了 原 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And looking round on them he was angry, being sad because of their hard hearts; and he said to the man, Put out your hand. And he put it out, and his hand was made well.
<br>3:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;法 利 赛 人 出 去 ， 同 希 律 一 党 的 人 商 议 ， 怎 样 可 以 除 灭 耶 稣 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the Pharisees went out, and straight away made designs with the Herodians about how they might put him to death.
<br>3:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 和 门 徒 退 到 海 边 去 。 有 许 多 人 从 加 利 利 跟 随 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea, and a great number from Galilee came after him: and from Judaea,
<br>3:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;还 有 许 多 人 听 见 他 所 作 的 大 事 ， 就 从 犹 太 ， 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 以 土 买 ， 约 但 河 外 ， 并 推 罗 西 顿 的 四 方 ， 来 到 他 那 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and the other side of Jordan, and the country about Tyre and Sidon, a great number, hearing what great things he did, came to him.
<br>3:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 因 为 人 多 ， 就 吩 咐 门 徒 叫 一 只 小 船 伺 候 着 ， 免 得 众 人 拥 挤 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he made a request to his disciples to have a little boat ready for him, so that he might not be crushed by the people;
<br>3:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 治 好 了 许 多 人 ， 所 以 凡 有 灾 病 的 ， 都 挤 进 来 要 摸 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For he had made such a great number well that all those who were diseased were falling down before him for the purpose of touching him.
<br>3:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;污 鬼 无 论 何 时 看 见 他 就 俯 伏 在 他 面 前 喊 着 说 ， 你 是 神 的 儿 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, went down before him, crying out, and saying, You are the Son of God.
<br>3:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 再 三 地 嘱 咐 他 们 ， 不 要 把 他 显 露 出 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he gave them special orders not to say who he was.
<br>3:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 上 了 山 ， 随 自 己 的 意 思 叫 人 来 ， 他 们 便 来 到 他 那 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he went up into the mountain, and sent for those whom it was his pleasure to have with him: and they went to him.
<br>3:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 就 设 立 十 二 个 人 ， 要 他 们 常 和 自 己 同 在 ， 也 要 差 他 们 去 传 道 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he took twelve to be with him, so that he might send them out as preachers,
<br>3:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;并 给 他 们 权 柄 赶 鬼 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And give them the power of driving out evil spirits:
<br>3:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 十 二 个 人 有 西 门 ， 耶 稣 又 给 他 起 名 叫 彼 得 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Simon he surnamed Peter;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;To Simon he gave the second name of Peter;
<br>3:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;还 有 西 庇 太 的 儿 子 雅 各 ， 和 雅 各 的 兄 弟 约 翰 。 又 给 这 两 个 人 起 名 叫 半 尼 其 ， 就 是 雷 子 的 意 思 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And to James, the son of Zebedee, and John, the brother of James, he gave the second name of Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder:
<br>3:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 有 安 得 烈 ， 腓 力 ， 巴 多 罗 买 ， 马 太 ， 多 马 ， 亚 勒 腓 的 儿 子 雅 各 ， 和 达 太 ， 并 奋 锐 党 的 西 门 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James, the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot;
<br>3:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;还 有 卖 耶 稣 的 加 略 人 犹 大 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Judas Iscariot, who was false to him.
<br>3:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 进 了 一 个 屋 子 ， 众 人 又 聚 集 ， 甚 至 他 连 饭 也 顾 不 得 吃 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he went into a house. And the people came together again, so that they were not even able to take bread.
<br>3:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 的 亲 属 听 见 ， 就 出 来 要 拉 住 他 ， 因 为 他 们 说 他 癫 狂 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when his friends had news of it, they went out to get him, saying, He is off his head.
<br>3:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;从 耶 路 撒 冷 下 来 的 文 士 说 ， 他 是 被 别 西 卜 附 着 。 又 说 ， 他 是 靠 着 鬼 王 赶 鬼 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem, said, He has Beelzebub, and, By the ruler of evil spirits he sends evil spirits out of men.
<br>3:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 叫 他 们 来 ， 用 比 喻 对 他 们 说 ， 撒 但 怎 能 赶 出 撒 但 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And turning to them, he said to them in the form of a story, How is it possible for Satan to put out Satan?
<br>3:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;若 一 国 自 相 分 争 ， 那 国 就 站 立 不 住 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;If there is division in a kingdom, that kingdom will come to destruction;
<br>3:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;若 一 家 自 相 分 争 ， 那 家 就 站 立 不 住 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And if there is division in a house, that house will come to destruction;
<br>3:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;若 撒 但 自 相 攻 打 分 争 ， 他 就 站 立 不 住 ， 必 要 灭 亡 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And if Satan is at war with himself, and there is division in him, he will not keep his place but will come to an end.
<br>3:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;没 有 人 能 进 壮 士 家 里 抢 夺 他 的 家 具 。 必 先 捆 住 那 壮 士 ， 才 可 以 抢 夺 他 的 家 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But no one is able to go into the house of the strong man and take his goods, without first putting cords round the strong man, and then he will take his goods.
<br>3:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 世 人 一 切 的 罪 ， 和 一 切 亵 渎 的 话 ， 都 可 得 赦 免 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Truly, I say to you, The sons of men will have forgiveness for all their sins and for all the evil words they say:
<br>3:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;凡 亵 渎 圣 灵 的 ， 却 永 不 得 赦 免 ， 乃 要 担 当 永 远 的 罪 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But whoever says evil things against the Holy Spirit will never have forgiveness, but the evil he has done will be with him for ever:
<br>3:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 话 是 因 为 他 们 说 ， 他 是 被 污 鬼 附 着 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Because they said, He has an unclean spirit.
<br>3:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;当 下 耶 稣 的 母 亲 ， 和 弟 兄 ， 来 站 在 外 边 ， 打 发 人 去 叫 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And his mother and brothers came and were outside, and sent for him, requesting to see him.
<br>3:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 许 多 人 在 耶 稣 周 围 坐 着 。 他 们 就 告 诉 他 说 ， 看 哪 ， 你 母 亲 ， 和 你 弟 兄 ， 在 外 边 找 你 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And a great number were seated round him; and they said to him, See, your mother and your brothers are outside looking for you.
<br>3:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 谁 是 我 的 母 亲 ， 谁 是 我 的 弟 兄 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said in answer, Who are my mother and my brothers?
<br>3:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 四 面 观 看 那 周 围 坐 着 的 人 ， 说 ， 看 哪 ， 我 的 母 亲 ， 我 的 弟 兄 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And looking round at those who were seated about him, he said, See, my mother and my brothers!
<br>3:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;凡 遵 行 神 旨 意 的 人 ， 就 是 我 的 弟 兄 姐 妹 和 母 亲 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Whoever does God's pleasure, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.
