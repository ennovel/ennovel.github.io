<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he got up, and went into the country of Judaea on the other side of Jordan: and great numbers of people came together to him again; and, as was his way, he gave them teaching.
<br>10:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 法 利 赛 人 来 问 他 说 ， 人 休 妻 可 以 不 可 以 ， 意 思 要 试 探 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Pharisees came to him, testing him with the question, Is it right for a man to put away his wife?
<br>10:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 摩 西 吩 咐 你 们 的 是 什 么 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them in answer, What did Moses say you were to do?
<br>10:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 说 ， 摩 西 许 人 写 了 休 书 便 可 以 休 妻 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they said to him, Moses let us give her a statement in writing, and be free from her.
<br>10:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 摩 西 因 为 你 们 的 心 硬 ， 所 以 写 这 条 例 给 你 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Jesus said to them, Because of your hard hearts he gave you this law.
<br>10:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 从 起 初 创 造 的 时 候 ， 神 造 人 是 造 男 造 女 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But from the first, male and female made he them.
<br>10:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 此 人 要 离 开 父 母 ， 与 妻 子 连 合 ， 二 人 成 为 一 体 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For this cause will a man go away from his father and mother, and be joined to his wife;
<br>10:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;既 然 如 此 ， 夫 妻 不 再 是 两 个 人 ， 乃 是 一 体 的 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the two will become one flesh; so that they are no longer two, but one flesh.
<br>10:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;所 以 神 配 合 的 ， 人 不 可 分 开 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Let not that which has been joined together by God be parted by man.
<br>10:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;到 了 屋 里 ， 门 徒 就 问 他 这 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And in the house the disciples put questions to him again about this thing.
<br>10:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 凡 休 妻 另 娶 的 ， 就 是 犯 奸 淫 ， 辜 负 他 的 妻 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, Whoever puts away his wife and takes another, is false to his wife;
<br>10:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;妻 子 若 离 弃 丈 夫 另 嫁 ， 也 是 犯 奸 淫 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And if she herself puts away her husband and takes another, she is false to her husband.
<br>10:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 人 带 着 小 孩 子 来 见 耶 稣 ， 要 耶 稣 摸 他 们 ， 门 徒 便 责 备 那 些 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they took to him little children, so that he might put his hands on them: and the disciples said sharp words to them.
<br>10:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 看 见 就 恼 怒 ， 对 门 徒 说 ， 让 小 孩 子 到 我 这 里 来 ， 不 要 禁 止 他 们 。 因 为 在 神 国 的 ， 正 是 这 样 的 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when Jesus saw it, he was angry, and said to them, Let the little children come to me, and do not keep them away; for of such is the kingdom of God.
<br>10:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 凡 要 承 受 神 国 的 ， 若 不 像 小 孩 子 ， 断 不 能 进 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Truly I say to you, Whoever does not put himself under the kingdom of God like a little child, will not come into it at all.
<br>10:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 抱 着 小 孩 子 ， 给 他 们 按 手 ， 为 他 们 祝 福 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he took them in his arms, and gave them a blessing, putting his hands on them.
<br>10:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 出 来 行 路 的 时 候 ， 有 一 个 人 跑 来 ， 跪 在 他 面 前 问 他 说 ， 良 善 的 夫 子 ， 我 当 作 什 么 事 ， 才 可 以 承 受 永 生 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And while he was going out into the way, a man came running to him, and went down on his knees, saying, Good Master, what have I to do so that I may have eternal life?
<br>10:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 说 ， 你 为 什 么 称 我 是 良 善 的 。 除 了 神 一 位 之 外 ， 再 没 有 良 善 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus said to him, Why do you say I am good? no one is good but one, and that is God.
<br>10:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;诫 命 你 是 晓 得 的 ， 不 可 杀 人 ， 不 可 奸 淫 ， 不 可 偷 盗 ， 不 可 作 假 见 证 ， 不 可 亏 负 人 ， 当 孝 敬 父 母 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;You have knowledge of what is said in the law, Do not put any one to death, Do not be untrue in married life, Do not take what is not yours, Do not give false witness, Do not get money by deceit, Give honour to your father and mother.
<br>10:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 对 耶 稣 说 ， 夫 子 ， 这 一 切 我 从 小 都 遵 守 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to him, Master, all these laws I have kept from the time when I was young.
<br>10:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 看 着 他 ， 就 爱 他 ， 对 他 说 ， 你 还 缺 少 一 件 。 去 变 卖 你 所 有 的 ， 分 给 穷 人 ， 就 必 有 财 宝 在 天 上 。 你 还 要 来 跟 从 我 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus, looking on him and loving him, said, There is one thing needed: go, get money for your goods, and give it to the poor, and you will have wealth in heaven: and come with me.
<br>10:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 听 见 这 话 ， 脸 上 就 变 了 色 ， 忧 忧 愁 愁 地 走 了 。 因 为 他 的 产 业 很 多 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But his face became sad at the saying, and he went away sorrowing: for he was one who had much property.
<br>10:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 周 围 一 看 ， 对 门 徒 说 ， 有 钱 财 的 人 进 神 的 国 是 何 等 的 难 哪 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus, looking round about, said to his disciples, How hard it is for those who have wealth to come into the kingdom of God!
<br>10:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;门 徒 希 奇 他 的 话 。 耶 稣 又 对 他 们 说 ， 小 子 ， 倚 靠 钱 财 的 人 进 神 的 国 ， 是 何 等 的 难 哪 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the disciples were full of wonder at his words. But Jesus said to them again, Children, how hard it is for those who put faith in wealth to come into the kingdom of God!
<br>10:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;骆 驼 穿 过 针 的 眼 ， 比 财 主 进 神 的 国 ， 还 容 易 呢 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;It is simpler for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a man of wealth to come into the kingdom of God.
<br>10:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;门 徒 就 分 外 希 奇 ， 对 他 说 ， 这 样 谁 能 得 救 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they were greatly surprised, saying to him, Who then may have salvation?
<br>10:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 看 着 他 们 说 ， 在 人 是 不 能 ， 在 神 却 不 然 。 因 为 神 凡 事 都 能 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus, looking on them, said, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God.
<br>10:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 就 对 他 说 ， 看 哪 ， 我 们 已 经 撇 下 所 有 的 跟 从 你 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Peter said to him, See, we have given up everything, and come after you.
<br>10:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 人 为 我 和 福 音 ， 撇 下 房 屋 ， 或 是 弟 兄 ， 姐 妹 ， 父 母 ， 儿 女 ， 田 地 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus said, Truly I say to you, There is no man who has given up house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or land, because of me and the good news,
<br>10:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;没 有 不 在 今 世 得 百 倍 的 ， 就 是 房 屋 ， 弟 兄 ， 姐 妹 ， 母 亲 ， 儿 女 ， 田 地 ， 并 且 要 受 逼 迫 。 在 来 世 必 得 永 生 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Who will not get a hundred times as much now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and land--though with great troubles; and, in the world to come, eternal life.
<br>10:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;然 而 有 许 多 在 前 的 将 要 在 后 ， 在 后 的 将 要 在 前 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But a great number who are first will be last: and those who are last will be first.
<br>10:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 行 路 上 耶 路 撒 冷 去 。 耶 稣 在 前 头 走 ， 门 徒 就 希 奇 ， 跟 从 的 人 也 害 怕 。 耶 稣 又 叫 过 十 二 个 门 徒 来 ， 把 自 己 将 要 遭 遇 的 事 ， 告 诉 他 们 说 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going before them: and they were full of wonder; but those who came after him were in fear. And again he took the twelve, and gave them word of the things which were to come on him,
<br>10:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;看 哪 ， 我 们 上 耶 路 撒 冷 去 ， 人 子 将 要 被 交 给 祭 司 长 和 文 士 ， 他 们 要 定 他 死 罪 ， 交 给 外 邦 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Saying, See, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be given up to the chief priests and the scribes; and they will give an order for his death, and will give him up to the Gentiles:
<br>10:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 要 戏 弄 他 ， 吐 唾 沫 在 他 脸 上 ， 鞭 打 他 ， 杀 害 他 。 过 了 三 天 ， 他 要 复 活 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they will make sport of him, and put shame on him, and give him cruel blows, and will put him to death; and after three days he will come back from the dead.
<br>10:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;西 庇 太 的 儿 子 雅 各 ， 约 翰 进 前 来 ， 对 耶 稣 说 ， 夫 子 ， 我 们 无 论 求 你 什 么 ， 愿 你 给 我 们 作 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And there came to him James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying to him, Master, will you give us whatever may be our request?
<br>10:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 要 我 给 你 们 作 什 么 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, What would you have me do for you?
<br>10:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 说 ， 赐 我 们 在 你 的 荣 耀 里 ， 一 个 坐 在 你 右 边 ， 一 个 坐 在 你 左 边 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they said to him, Let us be seated, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.
<br>10:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 你 们 不 知 道 所 求 的 是 什 么 。 我 所 喝 的 杯 。 你 们 能 喝 吗 ？ 我 所 受 的 洗 ， 你 们 能 受 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Jesus said to them, You have no knowledge of what you are saying. Are you able to take of my cup? or to undergo the baptism which I am to undergo?
<br>10:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 说 ， 我 们 能 。 耶 稣 说 ， 我 所 喝 的 杯 ， 你 们 也 要 喝 。 我 所 受 的 洗 ， 你 们 也 要 受 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they said to him, We are able. And Jesus said to them, You will take of the cup from which I take; and the baptism which I am about to undergo you will undergo:
<br>10:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;只 是 坐 在 我 的 左 右 ， 不 是 我 可 以 赐 的 。 乃 是 为 谁 预 备 的 ， 就 赐 给 谁 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But to be seated at my right hand or at my left is not for me to give: but it is for those for whom it has been made ready.
<br>10:41&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 十 个 门 徒 听 见 ， 就 恼 怒 雅 各 ， 约 翰 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And hearing this, the ten became very angry with James and John.
<br>10:42&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 叫 他 们 来 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 知 道 ， 外 邦 人 有 尊 为 君 王 的 ， 治 理 他 们 。 有 大 臣 操 权 管 束 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus made them come to him, and said to them, You see that those who are made rulers over the Gentiles are lords over them, and their great ones have authority over them.
<br>10:43&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;只 是 在 你 们 中 间 ， 不 是 这 样 。 你 们 中 间 ， 谁 愿 为 大 ， 就 必 作 你 们 的 用 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But it is not so among you: but whoever has a desire to become great among you, let him be your servant:
<br>10:44&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 你 们 中 间 ， 谁 愿 为 首 ， 就 必 作 众 人 的 仆 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And whoever has a desire to be first among you, let him be servant of all.
<br>10:45&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 人 子 来 ， 并 不 是 要 受 人 的 服 事 ， 乃 是 要 服 事 人 ， 并 且 要 舍 命 ， 作 多 人 的 赎 价 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For truly the Son of man did not come to have servants, but to be a servant, and to give his life for the salvation of men.
<br>10:46&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;到 了 耶 利 哥 。 耶 稣 同 门 徒 并 许 多 人 出 耶 利 哥 的 时 候 ， 有 一 个 讨 饭 的 瞎 子 ， 是 底 买 的 儿 子 巴 底 买 ， 坐 在 路 旁 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they came to Jericho: and when he was going out of Jericho, with his disciples and a great number of people, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind man, was seated by the wayside, with his hand out for money.
<br>10:47&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 听 见 是 拿 撒 勒 的 耶 稣 ， 就 喊 着 说 ， 大 卫 的 子 孙 耶 稣 阿 ， 可 怜 我 吧 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when it came to his ears that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he gave a cry, and said, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.
<br>10:48&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 许 多 人 责 备 他 ， 不 许 他 作 声 ， 他 却 越 发 大 声 喊 着 说 ， 大 卫 的 子 孙 哪 ， 可 怜 我 吧 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And some of them, turning in protest, gave him an order to be quiet: but he went on crying out all the more, Son of David, have mercy on me.
<br>10:49&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 就 站 住 ， 说 ， 叫 过 他 来 。 他 们 就 叫 那 瞎 子 ， 对 他 说 ， 放 心 ， 起 来 ， 他 叫 你 啦 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus came to a stop and said, Let him come. And crying out to the blind man, they said to him, Be comforted: come, he has sent for you.
<br>10:50&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;瞎 子 就 丢 下 衣 服 ， 跳 起 来 ， 走 到 耶 稣 那 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he, putting off his coat, got up quickly, and came to Jesus.
<br>10:51&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 要 我 为 你 作 什 么 。 瞎 子 说 ， 拉 波 尼 ， 我 要 能 看 见 。 （ 拉 波 尼 就 是 夫 子 ）
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus said to him, What would you have me do to you? And the blind man said, Master, make me able to see.
<br>10:52&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 你 去 吧 。 你 的 信 救 了 你 了 。 瞎 子 立 刻 看 见 了 ， 就 在 路 上 跟 随 耶 稣 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus said to him, Go on your way; your faith has made you well. And straight away he was able to see, and went after him in the way.
