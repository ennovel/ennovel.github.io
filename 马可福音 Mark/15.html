<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the first thing in the morning the chief priests, with those in authority and the scribes and all the Sanhedrin, had a meeting, and put cords round Jesus, and took him away, and gave him up to Pilate.
<br>15:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 问 他 说 ， 你 是 犹 太 人 的 王 吗 ？ 耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 你 说 的 是 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Pilate put a question to him, Are you the King of the Jews? And he, answering, said to him, You say so.
<br>15:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;祭 司 长 告 他 许 多 的 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the chief priests said a number of things against him.
<br>15:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 又 问 他 说 ， 你 看 ， 他 们 告 你 这 么 多 的 事 ， 你 什 么 都 不 回 答 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Pilate again put a question, Do you say nothing in answer? see how much evil they say you have done.
<br>15:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 仍 不 回 答 ， 以 致 彼 拉 多 觉 得 希 奇 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Jesus gave no more answers, so that Pilate was full of wonder.
<br>15:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;每 逢 这 节 期 ， 巡 抚 照 众 人 所 求 的 ， 释 放 一 个 囚 犯 给 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now at the feast every year he let one prisoner go free at their request.
<br>15:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 一 个 人 名 叫 巴 拉 巴 ， 和 作 乱 的 人 一 同 捆 绑 。 他 们 作 乱 的 时 候 ， 曾 杀 过 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And there was one named Barabbas, in prison with those who had gone against the government and in the fight had taken life.
<br>15:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 上 去 求 巡 抚 ， 照 常 例 给 他 们 办 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the people went up, requesting him to do as he had done for them in other years.
<br>15:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 说 ， 你 们 要 我 释 放 犹 太 人 的 王 给 你 们 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Pilate said in answer to them, Is it your desire that I let the King of the Jews go free?
<br>15:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 原 晓 得 祭 司 长 是 因 为 嫉 妒 才 把 耶 稣 解 了 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For he saw that the chief priests had given him up through envy.
<br>15:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;只 是 祭 司 长 挑 唆 众 人 ， 宁 可 释 放 巴 拉 巴 给 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But the people were moved by the chief priests to make him let Barabbas go free.
<br>15:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 又 说 ， 那 么 样 你 们 所 称 为 犹 太 人 的 王 ， 我 怎 么 办 他 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Pilate again said in answer to them, What then am I to do to him to whom you give the name of the King of the Jews?
<br>15:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 又 喊 着 说 ， 把 他 钉 十 字 架 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they cried out again, Crucify him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they said again loudly, To the cross with him!
<br>15:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 说 ， 为 什 么 呢 ？ 他 作 了 什 么 恶 事 呢 ？ 他 们 便 极 力 地 喊 着 说 ， 把 他 钉 十 字 架 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has he done? But their cry was the louder, To the cross!
<br>15:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 要 叫 众 人 喜 悦 ， 就 释 放 巴 拉 巴 给 他 们 ， 将 耶 稣 鞭 打 了 ， 交 给 人 钉 十 字 架 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Pilate, desiring to do what was pleasing to the people, let Barabbas go free, and gave up Jesus, when he had been whipped, to be put to death on the cross.
<br>15:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;兵 丁 把 耶 稣 带 进 衙 门 院 里 。 叫 齐 了 全 营 的 兵 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the men of the army took him away into the square in front of the building which is the Praetorium, and they got together all the band.
<br>15:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 给 他 穿 上 紫 袍 ， 又 用 荆 棘 编 作 冠 冕 给 他 戴 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they put a purple robe on him, and twisting a crown of thorns, they put it on him;
<br>15:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 庆 贺 他 说 ， 恭 喜 犹 太 人 的 王 阿 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And, as if honouring him, they said, Long life to the King of the Jews!
<br>15:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 拿 一 根 苇 子 ， 打 他 的 头 ， 吐 唾 沫 在 他 脸 上 屈 膝 拜 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they gave him blows on the head with a stick and put shame on him and, going down on their knees, gave him worship.
<br>15:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;戏 弄 完 了 ， 就 给 他 脱 了 紫 袍 ， 仍 穿 上 他 自 己 的 衣 服 ， 带 他 出 去 ， 要 钉 十 字 架 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when they had made sport of him, they took the purple robe off him and put his clothing on him. And they took him out to put him to death on the cross.
<br>15:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 一 个 古 利 奈 人 西 门 ， 就 是 亚 力 山 大 和 鲁 孚 的 父 亲 ， 从 乡 下 来 ， 经 过 那 地 方 。 他 们 就 勉 强 他 同 去 ， 好 背 着 耶 稣 的 十 字 架 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they made one, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, who was going by, coming from the country, go with them, so that he might take his cross.
<br>15:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 带 耶 稣 到 了 各 各 他 地 方 ， （ 各 各 他 翻 出 来 ， 就 是 髑 髅 地 ）
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they took him to the place named Golgotha, which is, Dead Man's Head.
<br>15:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;拿 没 药 调 和 的 酒 给 耶 稣 ， 他 却 不 受 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they gave him wine mixed with myrrh; but he did not take it.
<br>15:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 将 他 钉 在 十 字 架 上 ， 拈 阄 分 他 的 衣 服 ， 看 是 谁 得 什 么 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he was nailed to the cross; and they made a division of his clothing among them, putting to the decision of chance what everyone was to take.
<br>15:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;钉 他 在 十 字 架 上 ， 是 巳 初 的 时 候 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And it was the third hour when they put him on the cross.
<br>15:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 上 面 有 他 的 罪 状 ， 写 的 是 犹 太 人 的 王 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the statement of his crime was put in writing on the cross, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
<br>15:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 又 把 两 个 强 盗 ， 和 他 同 钉 十 字 架 。 一 个 在 右 边 ， 一 个 在 左 边 。 （ 有 古 卷 在 此 有
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they put two thieves on crosses with him, one on his right side, and one on his left.
<br>15:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 就 应 了 经 上 的 话 说 ， 他 被 列 在 罪 犯 之 中 ）
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;[]
<br>15:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;从 那 里 经 过 的 人 辱 骂 他 ， 摇 着 头 说 ， 咳 ， 你 这 拆 毁 圣 殿 ， 三 日 又 建 造 起 来 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And those who went by made sport of him, shaking their heads, and saying, Ha! you who give the Temple to destruction, and put it up again in three days,
<br>15:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;可 以 救 自 己 从 十 字 架 上 下 来 吧 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Save thyself, and come down from the cross.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Keep yourself from death, and come down from the cross.
<br>15:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;祭 司 长 和 文 士 也 是 这 样 戏 弄 他 ， 彼 此 说 ， 他 救 了 别 人 ， 不 能 救 自 己 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;In the same way the chief priests, laughing at him among themselves with the scribes, said, A saviour of others, he has no salvation for himself.
<br>15:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;以 色 列 的 王 基 督 ， 现 在 可 以 从 十 字 架 上 下 来 ， 叫 我 们 看 见 ， 就 信 了 。 那 和 他 同 钉 的 人 也 是 讥 诮 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and have belief. And those who were put on crosses with him said evil things against him.
<br>15:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;从 午 正 到 申 初 遍 地 都 黑 暗 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the sixth hour had come, it was dark over all the land till the ninth hour.
<br>15:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;申 初 的 时 候 ， 耶 稣 大 声 喊 着 说 ， 以 罗 伊 ， 以 罗 伊 ， 拉 马 撒 巴 各 大 尼 ？ 翻 出 来 ， 就 是 ， 我 的 神 ， 我 的 神 ， 为 什 么 离 弃 我 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And at the ninth hour, Jesus said in a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, My God, my God, why are you turned away from me?
<br>15:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;旁 边 站 着 的 人 ， 有 的 听 见 就 说 ， 看 哪 ， 他 叫 以 利 亚 呢 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And some of those who were near, hearing it, said, See, he is crying to Elijah.
<br>15:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 一 个 人 跑 去 ， 把 海 绒 蘸 满 了 醋 ， 绑 在 苇 子 上 ， 送 给 他 喝 ， 说 ， 且 等 着 ， 看 以 利 亚 来 不 来 把 他 取 下 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And one of them went quickly and, getting a sponge full of bitter wine, put it on a rod, and gave it to him for drink, saying, Let be; let us see if Elijah will come to take him down.
<br>15:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 大 声 喊 叫 ， 气 就 断 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus gave a loud cry, and gave up his spirit.
<br>15:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;殿 里 的 幔 子 ， 从 上 到 下 裂 为 两 半 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the curtain of the Temple was parted in two from end to end.
<br>15:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;对 面 站 着 的 百 夫 长 ， 看 见 耶 稣 这 样 喊 叫 断 气 ， （ 有 古 卷 无 喊 叫 二 字 ） 就 说 ， 这 人 真 是 神 的 儿 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the captain, who was near, saw how he gave up his spirit, he said, Truly this man was a son of God.
<br>15:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;还 有 些 妇 女 ， 远 远 地 观 看 。 内 中 有 抹 大 拉 的 马 利 亚 ， 又 有 小 雅 各 和 约 西 的 母 亲 马 利 亚 ， 并 有 撒 罗 米 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And there were women watching from a distance: among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome,
<br>15:41&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 是 耶 稣 在 加 利 利 的 时 候 ， 跟 随 他 ， 服 事 他 的 那 些 人 ， 还 有 同 耶 稣 上 耶 路 撒 冷 的 好 些 妇 女 在 那 里 观 看 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Who went with him when he was in Galilee and took care of him; and a number of other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.
<br>15:42&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;到 了 晚 上 ， 因 为 这 是 预 备 日 ， 就 是 安 息 日 的 前 一 日 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when it was evening, because it was the time of getting ready, that is, the day before the Sabbath,
<br>15:43&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 亚 利 马 太 的 约 瑟 前 来 ， 他 是 尊 贵 的 议 士 ， 也 是 等 候 神 国 的 。 他 放 胆 进 去 见 彼 拉 多 ， 求 耶 稣 的 身 体 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;There came Joseph of Arimathaea, a responsible man in high honour, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God; and he went in to Pilate without fear, and made a request for the body of Jesus.
<br>15:44&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 诧 异 耶 稣 已 经 死 了 。 便 叫 百 夫 长 来 ， 问 他 耶 稣 死 了 久 不 久 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Pilate was surprised that he was dead; and, sending for the captain, he put a question to see if he had been dead for long.
<br>15:45&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;既 从 百 夫 长 得 知 实 情 ， 就 把 耶 稣 的 尸 首 赐 给 约 瑟 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he had news of it from the captain, he let Joseph have the body.
<br>15:46&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;约 瑟 买 了 细 麻 布 ， 把 耶 稣 取 下 来 ， 用 细 麻 布 裹 好 ， 安 放 在 磐 石 中 凿 出 来 的 坟 墓 里 。 又 滚 过 一 块 石 头 来 挡 住 墓 门 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he got a linen cloth and, taking him down, put the linen cloth round him, and put him in a place for the dead which had been cut out of a rock; and a stone was rolled against the door.
<br>15:47&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;抹 大 拉 的 马 利 亚 ， 和 约 西 的 母 亲 马 利 亚 。 都 看 见 安 放 他 的 地 方 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where he was put.
