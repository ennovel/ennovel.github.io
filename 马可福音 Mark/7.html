<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And there came together to him the Pharisees and certain of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem,
<br>7:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 曾 看 见 他 的 门 徒 中 ， 有 人 用 俗 手 ， 就 是 没 有 洗 的 手 ， 吃 饭 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And had seen that some of his disciples took their bread with unclean, that is, unwashed, hands.
<br>7:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;（ 原 来 法 利 赛 人 ， 和 犹 太 人 ， 都 拘 守 古 人 的 遗 传 ， 若 不 仔 细 洗 手 ， 就 不 吃 饭 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now the Pharisees, and all the Jews, do not take food without washing their hands with care, keeping the old rule which has been handed down to them:
<br>7:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;从 市 上 来 ， 若 不 洗 浴 ， 也 不 吃 饭 ， 还 有 好 些 别 的 规 矩 ， 他 们 历 代 拘 守 ， 就 是 洗 杯 ， 罐 ， 铜 器 ， 等 物 ） 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when they come from the market-place, they take no food till their hands are washed; and a number of other orders there are, which have been handed down to them to keep--washings of cups and pots and brass vessels.
<br>7:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;法 利 赛 人 和 文 士 问 他 说 ， 你 的 门 徒 为 什 么 不 照 古 人 的 遗 传 ， 用 俗 手 吃 饭 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the Pharisees and the scribes put the question to him, Why do your disciples not keep the rules of the fathers, but take their bread with unwashed hands?
<br>7:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 以 赛 亚 指 着 你 们 假 冒 为 善 之 人 所 说 的 预 言 ， 是 不 错 的 ， 如 经 上 说 ， 这 百 姓 用 嘴 唇 尊 敬 我 ， 心 却 远 离 我 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said, Well did Isaiah say of you, you false ones: These people give me honour with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
<br>7:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 将 人 的 吩 咐 ， 当 作 道 理 教 导 人 ， 所 以 拜 我 也 是 枉 然 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But their worship is to no purpose, while they give as their teaching the rules of men.
<br>7:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 是 离 弃 神 的 诫 命 ， 拘 守 人 的 遗 传 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For, turning away from the law of God, you keep the rules of men.
<br>7:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 说 ， 你 们 诚 然 是 废 弃 神 的 诫 命 ， 要 守 自 己 的 遗 传 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, Truly you put on one side the law of God, so that you may keep the rules which have been handed down to you.
<br>7:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;摩 西 说 ， 当 孝 敬 父 母 。 又 说 ， 咒 骂 父 母 的 ， 必 治 死 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For Moses said, Give honour to your father and mother, and, He who says evil of father or mother, let him have the punishment of death:
<br>7:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 倒 说 ， 人 若 对 父 母 说 ， 我 所 当 奉 给 你 的 ， 已 经 作 了 各 耳 板 ， （ 各 耳 板 ， 就 是 供 献 的 意 思 ）
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But you say, If a man says to his father or his mother, That by which you might have had profit from me is Corban, that is to say, Given to God,
<br>7:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;以 后 你 们 就 不 容 他 再 奉 养 父 母 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;You no longer let him do anything for his father or his mother;
<br>7:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 就 是 你 们 承 接 遗 传 ， 废 了 神 的 道 。 你 们 还 作 许 多 这 样 的 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Making the word of God of no effect by your rule, which you have given: and a number of other such things you do.
<br>7:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 又 叫 众 人 来 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 都 要 听 我 的 话 ， 也 要 明 白 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And turning to the people again, he said to them, Give ear to me all of you, and let my words be clear to you:
<br>7:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;从 外 面 进 去 的 ， 不 能 污 秽 人 ， 惟 有 从 里 面 出 来 的 ， 乃 能 污 秽 人 。 （ 有 古 卷 在 此 有 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;There is nothing outside the man which, going into him, is able to make him unclean: but the things which come out of the man are those which make the man unclean.
<br>7:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 耳 可 听 的 就 应 当 听 ） 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;[]
<br>7:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 离 开 众 人 ， 进 了 屋 子 ， 门 徒 就 问 他 这 比 喻 的 意 思 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he had gone into the house away from all the people, his disciples put questions to him about the saying.
<br>7:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 也 是 这 样 不 明 白 吗 ？ 岂 不 晓 得 凡 从 外 面 进 入 的 ， 不 能 污 秽 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, Have even you so little wisdom? Do you not see that whatever goes into a man from outside is not able to make him unclean,
<br>7:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 不 是 入 他 的 心 ， 乃 是 入 他 的 肚 腹 ， 又 落 到 茅 厕 里 。 这 是 说 ， 各 样 的 食 物 ， 都 是 洁 净 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Because it goes not into the heart but into the stomach, and goes out with the waste? He said this, making all food clean.
<br>7:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 说 ， 从 人 里 面 出 来 的 ， 那 才 能 污 秽 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said, That which comes out of the man, that makes the man unclean.
<br>7:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 从 里 面 ， 就 是 从 人 心 里 ， 发 出 恶 念 ， 苟 合 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Because from inside, from the heart of men, come evil thoughts and unclean pleasures,
<br>7:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;偷 盗 ， 凶 杀 ， 奸 淫 ， 贪 婪 ， 邪 恶 ， 诡 诈 ， 淫 荡 ， 嫉 妒 ， 谤 ？ ？ ， 骄 傲 ， 狂 妄 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The taking of goods and of life, broken faith between husband and wife, the desire of wealth, wrongdoing, deceit, sins of the flesh, an evil eye, angry words, pride, foolish acts:
<br>7:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 一 切 的 恶 ， 都 是 从 里 面 出 来 ， 且 能 污 秽 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;All these evil things come from inside, and make the man unclean.
<br>7:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 从 那 里 起 身 ， 往 推 罗 西 顿 的 境 内 去 。 进 了 一 家 ， 不 愿 意 人 知 道 ， 却 隐 藏 不 住 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he went away from there to the country of Tyre and Sidon. And he went into a house, desiring that no man might have knowledge of it: and he was not able to keep it secret.
<br>7:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;当 下 有 一 个 妇 人 ， 她 的 小 女 儿 被 污 鬼 附 着 ， 听 见 耶 稣 的 事 ， 就 来 俯 伏 在 他 脚 前 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having had news of him, came straight away and went down at his feet.
<br>7:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 妇 人 是 希 利 尼 人 ， 属 叙 利 非 尼 基 族 。 她 求 耶 稣 赶 出 那 鬼 ， 离 开 她 的 女 儿 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now the woman was a Greek, a Syro-phoenician by birth: and she made a request to him that he would send the evil spirit out of her daughter.
<br>7:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 她 说 ， 让 儿 女 们 先 吃 饱 。 不 好 拿 儿 女 的 饼 丢 给 狗 吃 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to her, Let the children first have their food: for it is not right to take the children's bread and give it to the dogs.
<br>7:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;妇 人 回 答 说 ， 主 阿 ， 不 错 。 但 是 狗 在 桌 子 底 下 ， 也 吃 孩 子 们 的 碎 渣 儿 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But she said to him in answer, Yes, Lord: even the dogs under the table take the bits dropped by the children.
<br>7:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 她 说 ， 因 这 句 话 ， 你 回 去 吧 。 鬼 已 经 离 开 你 的 女 儿 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to her, For this saying go your way; the evil spirit has gone out of your daughter.
<br>7:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;她 就 回 家 去 ， 见 小 孩 子 躺 在 床 上 ， 鬼 已 经 出 去 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And she went away to her house, and saw the child on the bed, and the evil spirit gone out.
<br>7:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 又 离 了 推 罗 的 境 界 ， 经 过 西 顿 ， 就 从 低 加 波 利 境 内 来 到 加 利 利 海 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And again he went out from Tyre, and came through Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the country of Decapolis.
<br>7:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 人 带 着 一 个 耳 聋 舌 结 的 人 ， 来 见 耶 稣 ， 求 他 按 手 在 他 身 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they came to him with one who had no power of hearing and had trouble in talking; and they made a request to him to put his hands on him.
<br>7:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 领 他 离 开 众 人 ， 到 一 边 去 ， 就 用 指 头 探 他 的 耳 朵 ， 吐 唾 沫 抹 他 的 舌 头 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he took him on one side from the people privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he put water from his mouth on the man's tongue with his finger;
<br>7:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;望 天 叹 息 ， 对 他 说 ， 以 法 大 ， 就 是 说 ， 开 了 吧 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And looking up to heaven, he took a deep breath, and said to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be open.
<br>7:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 的 耳 朵 就 开 了 ， 舌 结 也 解 了 ， 说 话 也 清 楚 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And his ears became open, and the band of his tongue was made loose, and his words became clear.
<br>7:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 嘱 咐 他 们 ， 不 要 告 诉 人 。 但 他 越 发 嘱 咐 ， 他 们 越 发 传 扬 开 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he gave them orders not to give news of it to anyone; but the more he made this request, so much the more they made it public.
<br>7:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 分 外 希 奇 ， 说 ， 他 所 作 的 事 都 好 ， 他 连 聋 子 也 叫 他 们 听 见 ， 哑 吧 也 叫 他 们 说 话 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they were overcome with wonder, saying, He has done all things well: he even gives back the power of hearing and the power of talking to those who have been without them.
