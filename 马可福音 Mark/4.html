<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And again he was teaching by the seaside. And a very great number of people had come to him, so that he got into a boat on the sea and took his seat; and all the people were on the land by the seaside.
<br>4:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 就 用 比 喻 教 训 他 们 许 多 道 理 。 在 教 训 之 间 ， 对 他 们 说 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he gave them teaching about a number of things in the form of stories, and said to them in his teaching, Give ear:
<br>4:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 听 阿 。 有 一 个 撒 种 的 。 出 去 撒 种 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;A man went out to put seed in the earth:
<br>4:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;撒 的 时 候 ， 有 落 在 路 旁 的 ， 飞 鸟 来 吃 尽 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And while he was doing it, some was dropped by the wayside, and the birds came and took it for food.
<br>4:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 落 在 土 浅 石 头 地 上 的 ， 土 既 不 深 ， 发 苗 最 快 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And some went on the stones, where it had not much earth; and it came up straight away, because the earth was not deep:
<br>4:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;日 头 出 来 一 晒 ， 因 为 没 有 根 ， 就 枯 干 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the sun was high, it was burned; and because it had no root, it became dry and dead.
<br>4:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 落 在 荆 棘 里 的 ， 荆 棘 长 起 来 ， 把 他 挤 住 了 ， 就 不 结 实 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And some went among the thorns, and the thorns came up, and it had no room for growth and gave no fruit.
<br>4:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 有 落 在 好 土 里 的 ， 就 发 生 长 大 ， 结 实 有 三 十 倍 的 ， 有 六 十 倍 的 ， 有 一 百 倍 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And some, falling on good earth, gave fruit, coming up and increasing, and giving thirty, sixty, and a hundred times as much.
<br>4:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 说 ， 有 耳 可 听 的 ， 就 应 当 听 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, Whoever has ears, let him give ear.
<br>4:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;无 人 的 时 候 ， 跟 随 耶 稣 的 人 ， 和 十 二 个 门 徒 ， 问 他 这 比 喻 的 意 思 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he was by himself, those who were round him with the twelve put questions to him about the purpose of the stories.
<br>4:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 神 国 的 奥 秘 ， 只 叫 你 们 知 道 ， 若 是 对 外 人 讲 ， 凡 事 就 用 比 喻 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, To you is given the secret of the kingdom of God, but to those who are outside, all things are given in the form of stories;
<br>4:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;叫 他 们 看 是 看 见 ， 却 不 晓 得 。 听 是 听 见 ， 却 不 明 白 。 恐 怕 他 们 回 转 过 来 ， 就 得 赦 免 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So that seeing they may see, and it will not be clear to them; and hearing it, they will not get the sense; for fear that they may be turned again to me and have forgiveness.
<br>4:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 不 明 白 这 比 喻 吗 ？ 这 样 怎 能 明 白 一 切 的 比 喻 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, If you are not clear about this story, how will you be clear about the others?
<br>4:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;撒 种 之 人 所 撒 的 ， 就 是 道 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The sower soweth the word.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The seed is the word.
<br>4:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 撒 在 路 旁 的 ， 就 是 人 听 了 道 ， 撒 但 立 刻 来 ， 把 撒 在 他 心 里 的 道 夺 了 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And these are they by the wayside, where the word is planted; and when they have given ear, the Evil One comes straight away and takes away the word which has been planted in them.
<br>4:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 撒 在 石 头 地 上 的 ， 就 是 人 听 了 道 ， 立 刻 欢 喜 领 受 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And in the same way, these are they who are planted on the stones, who, when the word has come to their ears, straight away take it with joy;
<br>4:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 他 心 里 没 有 根 ， 不 过 是 暂 时 的 ， 及 至 为 道 遭 了 患 难 ， 或 是 受 了 逼 迫 ， 立 刻 就 跌 倒 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they have no root in themselves, but go on for a time; then, when trouble comes or pain, because of the word, they quickly become full of doubts.
<br>4:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;还 有 那 撒 在 荆 棘 里 的 ， 就 是 人 听 了 道 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And others are those planted among the thorns; these are they who have given ear to the word,
<br>4:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;后 来 有 世 上 的 思 虑 ， 钱 财 的 迷 惑 ， 和 别 样 的 私 欲 ， 进 来 把 道 挤 住 了 ， 就 不 能 结 实 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the cares of this life, and the deceits of wealth, and the desire for other things coming in, put a stop to the growth of the word, and it gives no fruit.
<br>4:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 撒 在 好 地 上 的 ， 就 是 人 听 道 ， 又 领 受 ， 并 且 结 实 ， 有 三 十 倍 的 ， 有 六 十 倍 的 ， 有 一 百 倍 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And these are they who were planted on the good earth; such as give ear to the word, and take it into their hearts, and give fruit, thirty and sixty and a hundred times as much.
<br>4:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 又 对 他 们 说 ， 人 拿 灯 来 ， 岂 是 要 放 在 斗 底 下 ， 床 底 下 ， 不 放 在 灯 台 上 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, When the light comes in, do people put it under a vessel, or under the bed, and not on its table?
<br>4:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 掩 藏 的 事 ， 没 有 不 显 出 来 的 。 隐 瞒 的 事 ， 没 有 不 露 出 来 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;There is nothing covered which will not be seen openly, and nothing has been made secret which will not come to light.
<br>4:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 耳 可 听 的 ， 就 应 当 听 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;If any man has ears, let him give ear.
<br>4:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 说 你 们 所 听 的 要 留 心 。 你 们 用 什 么 量 器 量 给 人 ， 也 必 用 什 么 量 器 量 给 你 们 ， 并 且 要 多 给 你 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, Take care what you give ear to: in the same measure as you give you will get, and more will be given to you.
<br>4:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 有 的 还 要 给 他 。 没 有 的 ， 连 他 所 有 的 也 要 夺 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He who has, to him will be given: and he who has not, from him will be taken even that which he has.
<br>4:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 说 ， 神 的 国 ， 如 同 人 把 种 撒 在 地 上 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said, Such is the kingdom of God, as if a man put seed in the earth,
<br>4:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;黑 夜 睡 觉 ， 白 日 起 来 ， 这 种 就 发 芽 渐 长 ， 那 人 却 不 晓 得 如 何 这 样 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And went to sleep and got up, night and day, and the seed came to growth, though he had no idea how.
<br>4:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;地 生 五 谷 ， 是 出 于 自 然 的 。 先 发 苗 ， 后 长 穗 ， 再 后 穗 上 结 成 饱 满 的 子 粒 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The earth gives fruit by herself; first the leaf, then the head, then the full grain.
<br>4:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;谷 既 熟 了 ， 就 用 镰 刀 去 割 ， 因 为 收 成 的 时 候 到 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But when the grain is ready, he quickly sends men to get it cut, because the time for cutting has come.
<br>4:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 说 ， 神 的 国 ， 我 们 可 用 什 么 比 较 呢 ？ 可 用 什 么 比 喻 表 明 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said, What picture may we give of the kingdom of God, or with what story may we make it clear?
<br>4:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;好 像 一 粒 芥 菜 种 ， 种 在 地 里 的 时 候 ， 虽 比 地 上 的 百 种 都 小 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is put in the earth, is smaller than all the seeds on the earth,
<br>4:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 种 上 以 后 ， 就 长 起 来 ， 比 各 样 的 菜 都 大 ， 又 长 出 大 枝 来 。 甚 至 天 上 的 飞 鸟 ， 可 以 宿 在 它 的 荫 下 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But when it is planted, it comes up, and becomes taller than all the plants, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of heaven are able to take rest in its shade.
<br>4:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 用 许 多 这 样 的 比 喻 ， 照 他 们 所 能 听 的 ， 对 他 们 讲 道 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And with a number of such stories he gave them his teaching, as they were able to take it:
<br>4:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;若 不 用 比 喻 ， 就 不 对 他 们 讲 。 没 有 人 的 时 候 ， 就 把 一 切 的 道 讲 给 门 徒 听 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And without a story he said nothing to them: but privately to his disciples he made all things clear.
<br>4:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;当 那 天 晚 上 ， 耶 稣 对 门 徒 说 ， 我 们 渡 到 那 边 去 吧 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And on that day, when the evening had come, he said to them, Let us go over to the other side.
<br>4:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;门 徒 离 开 众 人 ， 耶 稣 仍 在 船 上 ， 他 们 就 把 他 一 同 带 去 。 也 有 别 的 船 和 他 同 行 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And going away from the people, they took him with them, as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him.
<br>4:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;忽 然 起 了 暴 风 ， 波 浪 打 入 船 内 ， 甚 至 船 要 满 了 水 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And a great storm of wind came up, and the waves came into the boat, so that the boat was now becoming full.
<br>4:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 在 船 尾 上 ， 枕 着 枕 头 睡 觉 。 门 徒 叫 醒 了 他 ， 说 ， 夫 子 ， 我 们 丧 命 ， 你 不 顾 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he himself was in the back of the boat, sleeping on the cushion: and they, awaking him, said, Master, is it nothing to you that we are in danger of destruction?
<br>4:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 醒 了 ， 斥 责 风 ， 向 海 说 ， 住 了 吧 ， 静 了 吧 。 风 就 止 住 ， 大 大 地 平 静 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he came out of his sleep, and gave strong orders to the wind, and said to the sea, Peace, be at rest. And the wind went down, and there was a great calm.
<br>4:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 为 什 么 胆 怯 。 你 们 还 没 有 信 心 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, Why are you full of fear? have you still no faith?
<br>4:41&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 就 大 大 地 惧 怕 ， 彼 此 说 ， 这 到 底 是 谁 ， 连 风 和 海 也 听 从 他 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And their fear was great, and they said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea do his orders?
