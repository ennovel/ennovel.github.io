<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he came into Capernaum again after some days, the news went about that he was in the house.
<br>2:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 有 许 多 人 聚 集 ， 甚 至 连 门 前 都 没 有 空 地 ， 耶 稣 就 对 他 们 讲 道 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And a great number had come together, so that there was no longer room for them, no, not even about the door: and he gave them teaching.
<br>2:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 人 带 着 一 个 瘫 子 来 见 耶 稣 ， 是 用 四 个 人 抬 来 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And four men came to him with one on a bed who had no power of moving.
<br>2:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 人 多 ， 不 得 近 前 ， 就 把 耶 稣 所 在 的 房 子 ， 拆 了 房 顶 ， 既 拆 通 了 ， 就 把 瘫 子 连 所 躺 卧 的 褥 子 都 缒 下 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when they were unable to get near him because of all the people, they got the roof uncovered where he was: and when it was broken up, they let down the bed on which the man was.
<br>2:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 见 他 们 的 信 心 ， 就 对 瘫 子 说 ， 小 子 ， 你 的 罪 赦 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to him, Son, you have forgiveness for your sins.
<br>2:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 几 个 文 士 坐 在 那 里 ， 心 里 议 论 说 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But there were certain of the scribes seated there, and reasoning in their hearts,
<br>2:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 个 人 为 什 么 这 样 说 呢 ？ 他 说 僭 妄 的 话 了 。 除 了 神 以 外 ， 谁 能 赦 罪 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Why does this man say such things? he has no respect for God: from whom does forgiveness come but from God only?
<br>2:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 心 中 知 道 他 们 心 里 这 样 议 论 ， 就 说 ， 你 们 心 里 为 什 么 这 样 议 论 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus, having knowledge in his spirit of their thoughts, said to them, Why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts?
<br>2:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;或 对 瘫 子 说 ， 你 的 罪 赦 了 ， 或 说 ， 起 来 拿 你 的 褥 子 行 走 ， 哪 一 样 容 易 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Which is the simpler, to say to a man who is ill, You have forgiveness for your sins, or, Get up, take up your bed, and go?
<br>2:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 要 叫 你 们 知 道 人 子 在 地 上 有 赦 罪 的 权 柄 ， 就 对 瘫 子 说 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But so that you may see that the Son of man has authority for the forgiveness of sins on earth, (he said to the man,)
<br>2:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 吩 咐 你 起 来 ， 拿 你 的 褥 子 回 家 去 吧 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;I say to you, Get up, take up your bed, and go to your house.
<br>2:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 人 就 起 来 ， 立 刻 拿 着 褥 子 ， 当 众 人 面 前 出 去 了 。 以 致 众 人 都 惊 奇 ， 归 荣 耀 与 神 说 ， 我 们 从 来 没 有 见 过 这 样 的 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he got up, and straight away took up the bed and went out before them all, so that they were all full of wonder, and gave glory to God, saying, We have never seen anything like this.
<br>2:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 又 出 到 海 边 去 ， 众 人 都 就 了 他 来 ， 他 便 教 训 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he went out again by the seaside; and all the people came to him, and he gave them teaching.
<br>2:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 经 过 的 时 候 ， 看 见 亚 勒 腓 的 儿 子 利 未 ， 坐 在 税 关 上 ， 就 对 他 说 ， 你 跟 从 我 来 。 他 就 起 来 跟 从 了 耶 稣 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he went by, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, seated at the place where taxes were taken, and he said to him, Come with me. And he got up, and went with him.
<br>2:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 在 利 未 家 里 坐 席 的 时 候 ， 有 好 些 税 吏 和 罪 人 ， 与 耶 稣 并 门 徒 一 同 坐 席 。 因 为 这 样 的 人 多 ， 他 们 也 跟 随 耶 稣 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And it came about that he was seated at meat in his house, and a number of tax-farmers and sinners were at table with Jesus and his disciples: for there were a great number of them, and they came after him.
<br>2:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;法 利 赛 人 中 的 文 士 ， （ 有 古 卷 作 文 士 和 法 利 赛 人 ） 看 见 耶 稣 和 罪 人 并 税 吏 一 同 吃 饭 ， 就 对 他 门 徒 说 ， 他 和 税 吏 并 罪 人 一 同 吃 喝 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was taking food with the tax-farmers and sinners, said to his disciples, Why does he take food and drink with such men?
<br>2:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 听 见 ， 就 对 他 们 说 ， 健 康 的 人 用 不 着 医 生 ， 有 病 的 人 才 用 得 着 。 我 来 本 不 是 召 义 人 ， 乃 是 召 罪 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus, hearing it, said to them, Those who are well have no need of a medical man, but those who are ill: I have come not to get the upright but sinners.
<br>2:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;当 下 ， 约 翰 的 门 徒 和 法 利 赛 人 禁 食 。 他 们 来 问 耶 稣 说 ， 约 翰 的 门 徒 和 法 利 赛 人 的 门 徒 禁 食 ， 你 的 门 徒 倒 不 禁 食 ， 这 是 为 什 么 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And John's disciples and the Pharisees were taking no food: and they came and said to him, Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees go without food, but your disciples do not?
<br>2:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 新 郎 和 陪 伴 之 人 同 在 的 时 候 ， 陪 伴 之 人 岂 能 禁 食 呢 ？ 新 郎 还 同 在 ， 他 们 不 能 禁 食 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus said to them, Will the friends of a newly-married man go without food while he is with them? as long as they have him with them they will not go without food.
<br>2:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 日 子 将 到 ， 新 郎 要 离 开 他 们 ， 那 日 他 们 就 要 禁 食 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But the days will come when the husband will be taken away from them, and then they will go without food.
<br>2:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;没 有 人 把 新 布 缝 在 旧 衣 服 上 。 恐 怕 所 补 上 的 新 布 ， 带 坏 了 旧 衣 服 ， 破 得 就 更 大 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;No man puts a bit of new cloth on an old coat: or the new, by pulling away from the old, makes a worse hole.
<br>2:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;也 没 有 人 把 新 酒 装 在 旧 皮 袋 里 。 恐 怕 酒 把 皮 袋 裂 开 ， 酒 和 皮 袋 就 都 坏 了 。 惟 把 新 酒 装 在 新 皮 袋 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And no man puts new wine into old wine-skins: or the skins will be burst by the wine, and the wine and the skins will be wasted: but new wine has to be put into new wine-skins.
<br>2:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 当 安 息 日 ， 从 麦 地 经 过 。 他 门 徒 行 路 的 时 候 ， 掐 了 麦 穗 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And it came about that on the Sabbath day he was going through the grain-fields; and while they were walking, his disciples took the heads of grain.
<br>2:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;法 利 赛 人 对 耶 稣 说 ， 看 哪 ， 他 们 在 安 息 日 为 什 么 作 不 可 作 的 事 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the Pharisees said to him, Why are they doing what it is not right to do on the Sabbath?
<br>2:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 经 上 记 着 大 卫 和 跟 从 他 的 人 ， 缺 乏 饥 饿 之 时 所 作 的 事 ， 你 们 没 有 念 过 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, Have you no knowledge of what David did, when he had need and was without food, he, and those who were with him?
<br>2:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 当 亚 比 亚 他 作 大 祭 司 的 时 候 ， 怎 么 进 了 神 的 殿 ， 吃 了 陈 设 饼 ， 又 给 跟 从 他 的 人 吃 。 这 饼 除 了 祭 司 以 外 ， 人 都 不 可 吃 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;How he went into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and took for food the holy bread, which only the priests may take, and gave it to those who were with him?
<br>2:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 对 他 们 说 ， 安 息 日 是 为 人 设 立 的 ， 人 不 是 为 安 息 日 设 立 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath;
<br>2:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;所 以 人 子 也 是 安 息 日 的 主
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So that the Son of man is lord even of the Sabbath.
