<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes.
<br>5:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 一 下 船 ， 就 有 一 个 被 污 鬼 附 着 的 人 ， 从 坟 茔 里 出 来 迎 着 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he had got out of the boat, straight away there came to him from the place of the dead a man with an unclean spirit.
<br>5:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 人 常 住 在 坟 茔 里 ， 没 有 人 能 捆 住 他 ， 就 是 用 铁 链 也 不 能 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He was living in the place of the dead: and no man was able to keep him down, no, not with a chain;
<br>5:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 人 屡 次 用 脚 镣 和 铁 链 捆 锁 他 ， 铁 链 竟 被 他 挣 断 了 ， 脚 镣 也 被 他 弄 碎 了 。 总 没 有 人 能 制 伏 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Because he had frequently been prisoned in chains and iron bands, and the chains had been parted and the bands broken by him: and no man was strong enough to make him quiet.
<br>5:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 昼 夜 常 在 坟 茔 里 和 山 中 喊 叫 ， 又 用 石 头 砍 自 己 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And all the time, by day and by night, in the place of the dead, and in the mountains, he was crying out and cutting himself with stones.
<br>5:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 远 远 地 看 见 耶 稣 ， 就 跑 过 去 拜 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he saw Jesus from far off, he went quickly to him and gave him worship;
<br>5:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;大 声 呼 叫 说 ， 至 高 神 的 儿 子 耶 稣 ， 我 与 你 有 什 么 相 干 。 我 指 着 神 恳 求 你 ， 不 要 叫 我 受 苦 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And crying out with a loud voice he said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In God's name, do not be cruel to me.
<br>5:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;是 因 耶 稣 曾 吩 咐 他 说 ， 污 鬼 阿 ， 从 这 人 身 上 出 来 吧 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For Jesus had said to him, Come out of the man, you unclean spirit.
<br>5:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 问 他 说 ， 你 名 叫 什 么 。 回 答 说 ， 我 名 叫 群 ， 因 为 我 们 多 的 缘 故 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus said, What is your name? And he made answer, My name is Legion, because there are a great number of us.
<br>5:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 再 三 地 求 耶 稣 ， 不 要 叫 他 们 离 开 那 地 方 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he made strong prayers to him not to send them away out of the country.
<br>5:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 那 里 山 坡 上 ， 有 一 大 群 猪 吃 食 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now on the mountain side there was a great herd of pigs getting their food.
<br>5:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;鬼 就 央 求 耶 稣 说 ， 求 你 打 发 我 们 往 猪 群 里 附 着 猪 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they said to him, Send us into the pigs, so that we may go into them.
<br>5:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 准 了 他 们 。 污 鬼 就 出 来 ， 进 入 猪 里 去 。 于 是 那 群 猪 闯 下 山 崖 ， 投 在 海 里 ， 淹 死 了 。 猪 的 数 目 ， 约 有 二 千 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he let them do it. And the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs; and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the sea, about two thousand of them; and they came to their death in the sea.
<br>5:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;放 猪 的 就 逃 跑 了 ， 去 告 诉 城 里 和 乡 下 的 人 。 众 人 就 来 要 看 是 什 么 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And their keepers went running and gave an account of it in the town and in the country. And people came to see what had taken place.
<br>5:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 来 到 耶 稣 那 里 ， 看 见 那 被 鬼 附 着 的 人 ， 就 是 从 前 被 群 鬼 所 附 的 ， 坐 着 ， 穿 上 衣 服 ， 心 里 明 白 过 来 。 他 们 就 害 怕 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they came to Jesus, and saw the man in whom had been the evil spirits seated, clothed and with full use of his senses, and they were full of fear.
<br>5:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;看 见 这 事 的 ， 便 将 鬼 附 之 人 所 遇 见 的 ， 和 那 群 猪 的 事 ， 都 告 诉 了 众 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And those who had seen it gave them an account of what had been done to him who had the evil spirits, and of the fate of the pigs.
<br>5:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 就 央 求 耶 稣 离 开 他 们 的 境 界 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they made a request to him to go out of their country.
<br>5:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 上 船 的 时 候 ， 那 从 前 被 鬼 附 着 的 人 ， 恳 求 和 耶 稣 同 在 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he was getting into the boat, the man in whom had been the evil spirits had a great desire to come with him.
<br>5:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 不 许 ， 却 对 他 说 ， 你 回 家 去 ， 到 你 的 亲 属 那 里 ， 将 主 为 你 所 作 的 ， 是 何 等 大 的 事 ， 是 怎 样 怜 悯 你 ， 都 告 诉 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he would not let him, but said to him, Go to your house, to your friends, and give them news of the great things the Lord has done for you, and how he had mercy on you.
<br>5:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 人 就 走 了 ， 在 低 加 波 利 ， 传 扬 耶 稣 为 他 作 了 何 等 大 的 事 ， 众 人 就 都 希 奇 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he went on his way, and made public in the country of Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him: and all men were full of wonder.
<br>5:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 坐 船 又 渡 到 那 边 去 ， 就 有 许 多 人 到 他 那 里 聚 集 。 他 正 在 海 边 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when Jesus had gone over again in the boat to the other side, a great number of people came to him: and he was by the sea.
<br>5:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 一 个 管 会 堂 的 人 ， 名 叫 睚 鲁 ， 来 见 耶 稣 ， 就 俯 伏 在 他 脚 前 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And one of the rulers of the Synagogue, Jairus by name, came, and seeing him, went down at his feet,
<br>5:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;再 三 地 求 他 说 ， 我 的 小 女 儿 快 要 死 了 ， 求 你 去 按 手 在 她 身 上 ， 使 她 痊 愈 ， 得 以 活 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And made strong prayers to him, saying, My little daughter is near to death: it is my prayer that you will come and put your hands on her, so that she may be made well, and have life.
<br>5:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 就 和 他 同 去 ， 有 许 多 人 跟 随 拥 挤 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he went with him; and a great number of people went after him, and came round him.
<br>5:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 一 个 女 人 ， 患 了 十 二 年 的 血 漏 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And a woman, who had had a flow of blood for twelve years,
<br>5:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 好 些 医 生 手 里 ， 受 了 许 多 的 苦 。 又 花 尽 了 她 所 有 的 ， 一 点 也 不 见 好 ， 病 势 反 倒 更 重 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And had undergone much at the hands of a number of medical men, and had given all she had, and was no better, but even worse,
<br>5:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;她 听 见 耶 稣 的 事 ， 就 从 后 头 来 ， 杂 在 众 人 中 间 ， 摸 耶 稣 的 衣 裳 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;When she had news of the things which Jesus did, went among the people coming after him, and put her hand on his robe.
<br>5:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;意 思 说 ， 我 只 摸 他 的 衣 裳 ， 就 必 痊 愈 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For she said, If I may only put my hand on his robe, I will be made well.
<br>5:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 她 血 漏 的 源 头 ， 立 刻 干 了 。 她 便 觉 得 身 上 的 灾 病 好 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And straight away the fountain of her blood was stopped, and she had a feeling in her body that her disease had gone and she was well.
<br>5:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 顿 时 心 里 觉 得 有 能 力 从 自 己 身 上 出 去 ， 就 在 众 人 中 间 转 过 来 说 ， 谁 摸 我 的 衣 裳 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And straight away Jesus was conscious that power had gone out of him; and, turning to the people, he said, Who was touching my robe?
<br>5:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;门 徒 对 他 说 ， 你 看 众 人 拥 挤 你 ， 还 说 谁 摸 我 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And his disciples said to him, You see the people round you on every side, and you say, Who was touching me?
<br>5:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 周 围 观 看 ， 要 见 作 这 事 的 女 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And on his looking round to see her who had done this thing,
<br>5:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 女 人 知 道 在 自 己 身 上 所 成 的 事 ， 就 恐 惧 战 兢 ， 来 俯 伏 在 耶 稣 跟 前 ， 将 实 情 全 告 诉 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The woman, shaking with fear, conscious of what had been done to her, came and, falling on her face before him, gave him a true account of everything.
<br>5:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 她 说 ， 女 儿 ， 你 的 信 救 了 你 ， 平 平 安 安 地 回 去 吧 。 你 的 灾 病 痊 愈 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be free from your disease.
<br>5:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;还 说 话 的 时 候 ， 有 人 从 管 会 堂 的 家 里 来 说 ， 你 的 女 儿 死 了 ， 何 必 还 劳 动 先 生 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And while he was still talking, they came from the ruler of the Synagogue's house, saying, Your daughter is dead: why are you still troubling the Master?
<br>5:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 听 见 所 说 的 话 ， 就 对 管 会 堂 的 说 ， 不 要 怕 。 只 要 信 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Jesus, giving no attention to their words, said to the ruler of the Synagogue, Have no fear, only have faith.
<br>5:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 带 着 彼 得 ， 雅 各 ， 和 雅 各 的 兄 弟 约 翰 同 去 ， 不 许 别 人 跟 随 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he did not let anyone come with him, but Peter and James and John, the brother of James.
<br>5:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 来 到 管 会 堂 的 家 里 ， 耶 稣 看 见 那 里 乱 嚷 ， 并 有 人 大 大 地 哭 泣 哀 号 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they came to the house of the ruler of the Synagogue; and he saw people running this way and that, and weeping and crying loudly.
<br>5:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;进 到 里 面 ， 就 对 他 们 说 ， 为 什 么 乱 嚷 哭 泣 呢 ？ 孩 子 不 是 死 了 ， 是 睡 着 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he had gone in, he said to them, Why are you making such a noise and weeping? The child is not dead, but sleeping.
<br>5:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 就 嗤 笑 耶 稣 。 耶 稣 把 他 们 都 撵 出 去 ， 就 带 着 孩 子 的 父 母 ， 和 跟 随 的 人 进 了 孩 子 所 在 的 地 方 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they were laughing at him. But he, having sent them all out, took the father of the child and her mother and those who were with him, and went in where the child was.
<br>5:41&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 拉 着 孩 子 的 手 ， 对 她 说 ， 大 利 大 古 米 。 翻 出 来 ， 就 是 说 ， 闺 女 ， 我 吩 咐 你 起 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And taking her by the hand, he said to her, Talitha cumi, which is, My child, I say to you, Get up.
<br>5:42&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 闺 女 立 时 起 来 走 。 他 们 就 大 大 地 惊 奇 。 闺 女 已 经 十 二 岁 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the young girl got up straight away, and was walking about; she being twelve years old. And they were overcome with wonder.
<br>5:43&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 切 切 地 嘱 咐 他 们 ， 不 要 叫 人 知 道 这 事 。 又 吩 咐 给 她 东 西 吃 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he gave them special orders that they were not to say anything of this; and he said that some food was to be given to her.
