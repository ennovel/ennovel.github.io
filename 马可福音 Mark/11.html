<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when they came near to Jerusalem, to Beth-phage and Bethany, at the Mountain of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
<br>11:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 往 对 面 村 子 里 去 。 一 进 去 的 时 候 ， 必 看 见 一 匹 驴 驹 拴 在 那 里 ， 是 从 来 没 有 人 骑 过 的 。 可 以 解 开 牵 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And said to them, Go into the little town opposite: and when you come to it, you will see a young ass with a cord round his neck, on which no man has ever been seated; let him loose, and come back with him.
<br>11:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;若 有 人 对 你 们 说 ， 为 什 么 作 这 事 。 你 们 就 说 ， 主 要 用 它 。 那 人 必 立 时 让 你 们 牵 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And if anyone says to you, Why are you doing this? say, The Lord has need of him and will send him back straight away.
<br>11:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 去 了 ， 便 看 见 一 匹 驴 驹 ， 拴 在 门 外 街 道 上 ， 就 把 它 解 开 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they went away and saw a young ass by the door outside in the open street; and they were getting him loose.
<br>11:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 那 里 站 着 的 人 ， 有 几 个 说 ， 你 们 解 驴 驹 作 什 么 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And some of those who were there said to them, What are you doing, taking the ass?
<br>11:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;门 徒 照 着 耶 稣 所 说 的 回 答 ， 那 些 人 就 任 凭 他 们 牵 去 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they said to them the words which Jesus had said; and they let them go.
<br>11:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 把 驴 驹 牵 到 耶 稣 那 里 ， 把 自 己 的 衣 服 搭 在 上 面 ， 耶 稣 就 骑 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they took the young ass to Jesus, and put their clothing on him, and he got on his back.
<br>11:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 许 多 人 ， 把 衣 服 铺 在 路 上 ， 也 有 人 把 田 间 的 树 枝 砍 下 来 ， 铺 在 路 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And a great number put down their clothing in the way; and others put down branches which they had taken from the fields.
<br>11:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;前 行 后 随 的 人 ， 都 喊 着 说 ， 和 散 那 ， （ 和 散 那 原 有 求 救 的 意 思 ， 在 此 乃 是 称 颂 的 话 ） 奉 主 名 来 的 ， 是 应 当 称 颂 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And those who went in front, and those who came after, were crying, Glory: A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord:
<br>11:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 将 要 来 的 我 祖 大 卫 之 国 ， 是 应 当 称 颂 的 。 高 高 在 上 ， 和 散 那 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;A blessing on the coming kingdom of our father David: Glory in the highest.
<br>11:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 进 了 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 入 了 圣 殿 ， 周 围 看 了 各 样 物 件 。 天 色 已 晚 ， 就 和 十 二 个 门 徒 出 城 往 伯 大 尼 去 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he went into Jerusalem into the Temple; and after looking round about on all things, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.
<br>11:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;第 二 天 ， 他 们 从 伯 大 尼 出 来 。 耶 稣 饿 了 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And on the day after, when they had come out from Bethany, he was in need of food.
<br>11:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;远 远 地 看 见 一 棵 无 花 果 树 ， 树 上 有 叶 子 ， 就 往 那 里 去 ， 或 者 在 树 上 可 以 找 着 什 么 。 到 了 树 下 ， 竟 找 不 着 什 么 ， 不 过 有 叶 子 。 因 为 不 是 收 无 花 果 的 时 候 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And seeing a fig-tree in the distance with leaves, he went to see if by chance it had anything on it: and when he came to it, he saw nothing but leaves, for it was not the time for the fruit.
<br>11:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 就 对 树 说 ， 从 今 以 后 ， 永 没 有 人 吃 你 的 果 子 。 他 的 门 徒 也 听 见 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to it, Let no man take fruit from you for ever. And his disciples took note of his words.
<br>11:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 来 到 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 耶 稣 进 入 圣 殿 ， 赶 出 殿 里 作 买 卖 的 人 ， 推 倒 兑 换 银 钱 之 人 的 桌 子 ， 和 卖 鸽 子 之 人 的 凳 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they came to Jerusalem; and he went into the Temple, and sent out those who were trading there, overturning the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who were offering doves for money;
<br>11:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;也 不 许 人 拿 着 器 具 从 殿 里 经 过 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he would not let any man take a vessel through the Temple.
<br>11:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;便 教 训 他 们 说 ， 经 上 不 是 记 着 说 ， 我 的 殿 必 称 为 万 国 祷 告 的 殿 吗 ？ 你 们 倒 使 它 成 为 贼 窝 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he gave them teaching, and said to them, Is it not in the Writings, My house is to be named a house of prayer for all the nations? but you have made it a hole of thieves.
<br>11:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;祭 司 长 和 文 士 听 见 这 话 就 想 法 子 要 除 灭 耶 稣 。 却 又 怕 他 ， 因 为 众 人 都 希 奇 他 的 教 训 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And it came to the ears of the chief priests and scribes, and they took thought how they might put him to death; being in fear of him, because all the people were full of wonder at his teaching.
<br>11:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;每 天 晚 上 ， 耶 稣 出 城 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when even was come, he went out of the city.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And every evening he went out of the town.
<br>11:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;早 晨 ， 他 们 从 那 里 经 过 ， 看 见 无 花 果 树 连 根 都 枯 干 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when they were going by in the morning, they saw the fig-tree dead from the roots.
<br>11:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 想 起 耶 稣 的 话 来 ， 就 对 他 说 ， 拉 比 ， 请 看 ， 你 所 咒 诅 的 无 花 果 树 ， 已 经 枯 干 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Peter, having a memory of it, said to him, Master, see, the tree which was cursed by you is dead.
<br>11:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 你 们 当 信 服 神 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus, answering, said to them, Have God's faith.
<br>11:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 无 论 何 人 对 这 座 山 说 ， 你 挪 开 此 地 投 在 海 里 。 他 若 心 里 不 疑 惑 ， 只 信 他 所 说 的 必 成 ， 就 必 给 他 成 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Truly I say to you, Whoever says to this mountain, Be taken up and be put into the sea; and has no doubt in his heart, but has faith that what he says will come about, he will have his desire.
<br>11:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;所 以 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 凡 你 们 祷 告 祈 求 的 ， 无 论 是 什 么 ， 只 要 信 是 得 着 的 ， 就 必 得 着 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For this reason I say to you, Whatever you make a request for in prayer, have faith that it has been given to you, and you will have it.
<br>11:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 站 着 祷 告 的 时 候 ， 若 想 起 有 人 得 罪 你 们 ， 就 当 饶 恕 他 ， 好 叫 你 们 在 天 上 的 父 ， 也 饶 恕 你 们 的 过 犯 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And whenever you make a prayer, let there be forgiveness in your hearts, if you have anything against anyone; so that you may have forgiveness for your sins from your Father who is in heaven.
<br>11:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 若 不 饶 恕 人 ， 你 们 在 天 上 的 父 ， 也 不 饶 恕 你 们 的 过 犯 。 （ 有 古 卷 无 此 节 ）
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;[]
<br>11:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 又 来 到 耶 路 撒 冷 。 耶 稣 在 殿 里 行 走 的 时 候 ， 祭 司 长 和 文 士 并 长 老 进 前 来 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they came again to Jerusalem: and while he was walking in the Temple, there came to him the chief priests and the scribes and those in authority:
<br>11:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;问 他 说 ， 你 仗 着 什 么 权 柄 作 这 些 事 ？ 给 你 这 权 柄 的 是 谁 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they said to him, By what authority do you do these things? or who gave you authority to do these things?
<br>11:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 我 要 问 你 们 一 句 话 ， 你 们 回 答 我 ， 我 就 告 诉 你 们 ， 我 仗 着 什 么 权 柄 作 这 些 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus said to them, I will put to you one question; give me an answer, and I will say by what authority I do these things.
<br>11:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;约 翰 的 洗 礼 ， 是 从 天 上 来 的 是 从 人 间 来 的 呢 ？ 你 们 可 以 回 答 我 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The baptism of John, was it from heaven or from men? give me an answer.
<br>11:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 彼 此 商 议 说 ， 我 们 若 说 从 天 上 来 ， 他 必 说 ， 这 样 ， 你 们 为 什 么 不 信 他 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they gave thought to it among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did you not have faith in him?
<br>11:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;若 说 从 人 间 来 ， 却 又 怕 百 姓 。 因 为 众 人 真 以 约 翰 为 先 知 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But if we say, From men--they were in fear of the people, because all took John to be truly a prophet.
<br>11:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 回 答 耶 稣 说 ， 我 们 不 知 道 。 耶 稣 说 ， 我 也 不 告 诉 你 们 ， 我 仗 着 什 么 权 柄 作 这 些 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they said in answer to Jesus, We have no idea. And Jesus said to them, And I will not say to you by what authority I do these things.
