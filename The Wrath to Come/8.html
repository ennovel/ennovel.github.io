I am beginning to fear, Mr. Grant Slattery, that you are going to be a disappointment to me.”
<br> 
<br> “Not at tennis, anyhow,” he assured her. “You and I are going to wipe the ground with the Lancasters.”
<br> 
<br> “Our thoughts are on different planes,” she declared. “I speak of life and you of tennis. I think we shall beat them, if you stand up to the net and don’t poach.”
<br> 
<br> “How’s your father to-day?” he asked a little abruptly.
<br> 
<br> “Quite all right, considering. It must have been a terrible shock to him to see that poor old man collapse with scarcely a moment’s warning.”
<br> 
<br> “Naga was a great statesman,” Grant remarked. “One of the last of the old school. Come on, it’s our court.”
<br> 
<br> On the way across, an acquaintance hailed Grant. By his side stood Count Itash—sometimes called Sammy.
<br> 
<br> “Slattery, Count Itash says that he has only an informal acquaintance with you and would like an introduction,” the former said. “Count Itash—Mr. Grant Slattery.”
<br> 
<br> Grant held out his hand. The other, after a little bow, accepted it. He was an insignificant-looking person amongst the athletic young men by whom he was surrounded, but his eyes, behind his horn-rimmed spectacles, were exceptionally hard and piercing.
<br> 
<br> “I am glad to meet you, Mr. Slattery,” he said. “Could you, before you leave the courts, spare me a minute or two?”
<br> 
<br> “With pleasure,” Grant assented. “We are going to play the best of three sets here. I’ll look for you afterwards.”
<br> 
<br> “You are very kind, sir.”
<br> 
<br> “Who’s your little friend. Grant?” young Lancaster enquired curiously. “He’s the fellow we saw at the Carlton last night, isn’t he?”
<br> 
<br> “That’s the chap,” Grant replied. “He rejoices in the name of Itash. I believe I have heard that he is attached to the Japanese Embassy in Berlin and is doing secretarial work for their section here. Queer-looking card, isn’t he?”
<br> 
<br> “I couldn’t make out where I’d seen him before,” Lancaster observed, “I remember now; I used to see him driving about with Baron Naga. Dismal-looking beggar, isn’t he?”
<br> 
<br> “I expect the poor young man is upset about his Chief,” Susan remarked. “What did he want. Grant?”
<br> 
<br> “Wanted to speak to me,” was the indifferent reply. “He’s going to wait until after we’ve finished our three sets.”
<br> 
<br> “You’re going to get some part of what’s coming to you,” Susan laughed. “You took his dancing companion away last night and you spoiled Arthur’s luncheon to-day. Why don’t you get a girl of your own?”
<br> 
<br> “I try,” Grant confessed humbly. “I’m afraid I’m not popular with the sex.”
<br> 
<br> “That’s your fault,” Susan insisted. “A nicely brought-up girl always likes a well-behaved man. Now get up to the net and remember we’ve money on this set. Serve!”
<br> 
<br> The tennis courts presented a gay scene as the afternoon wore on. There was the usual crowd of English and French people, the women nearly all in white, the men, especially the foreigners, showing a little more variety in their costumes. The sun was shining and every one seemed inspired by the soft exhilaration of the air, the beauty of the glittering blue sea below, and the mountains behind. There was a crowd too of more elaborately dressed spectators, a fluttering of many-coloured parasols, and all the time the cheerful hum of light-hearted conversation in many tongues. With characteristic patience, Count Itash—sometimes called Sammy—sat on his solitary bench and waited—a solemn, almost ghoul-like figure, on the outskirts of the gaiety. At the conclusion of their sets. Grant, after he had received the congratulations of his partner, went over and seated himself by his side.
<br> 
<br> “What do you wish to say to me, Count Itash?” he enquired.
<br> 
<br> “I offer apologies, but I am in some trouble,” the young man explained earnestly. “It concerns the lady with whom you talked last night.”
<br> 
<br> “Mademoiselle Cleo?”
<br> 
<br> “The young lady who is so called,” Itash assented. “She has been my companion for some time here in Monte Carlo. I will now be very truthful. I have taken a fancy to another girl. Such things happen.”
<br> 
<br> “Quite so,” Grant agreed. “But I can’t exactly see how this concerns me.”
<br> 
<br> “It is in this way. Cleo is very, very angry. She knows that I am in the Diplomatic Service,—that I am, in fact, occupying a very confidential and important position down here. She makes a pretence of having obtained possession of secret information concerning the affairs over which I watch, and she threatens to make use of it.”
<br> 
<br> “Well?”
<br> 
<br> “But I have never confided in her, not one word,” the young man declared. “We Japanese are not like that. We do not talk. We carry our secrets in our brain.”
<br> 
<br> “Then if you have told her nothing, what are you afraid of?” Grant asked.
<br> 
<br> “I have told her nothing,” Itash repeated vehemently, “nor can I think of a single written line of a compromising nature which could possibly have come into her possession. Yet I am disturbed in my mind. Cleo is a strange being. She has the gift of speaking the truth. Not all people have it. When she speaks a thing, one’s heart feels that it is true. So when she tells me that there are secrets of mine which have come within her knowledge, I am afraid. She came to you last night, and she talked to you earnestly. I ask you, sir, did she tell you anything of those affairs confided to me, the disclosure of which could amount in any way to a breach of faith?”
<br> 
<br> “Not a word,” Grant assured him. “To be quite frank, I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
<br> 
<br> The young man passed his hand across his forehead.
<br> 
<br> “Mr. Slattery, sir,” he confessed, “I am in great distress of mind and body. The death of my Chief last night was terrible, and all the time I cannot escape from this load of anxiety which weighs upon me.”
<br> 
<br> “I should use a little common sense,” Grant advised. “If you know that you have told her nothing, if you know that you have committed none of your secrets, whatever they may be, to paper, can’t you realise that she is only trading upon your fears?”
<br> 
<br> “That must be so,” Itash muttered.
<br> 
<br> “Furthermore,” Grant continued, “if she had secrets to tell, why on earth should she bring them to me? I am the last person in the world likely to be interested in them.”
<br> 
<br> The young man shot a sudden quick glance at his companion. Then he blinked a great many times behind his spectacles.
<br> 
<br> “I see that,” he acknowledged. “You are not in the Diplomatic Service, Mr. Slattery?”
<br> 
<br> “In my younger days I was Secretary at Berlin and London for a short time,” Grant told him. “When I came into my money, however, I chucked it. The young lady’s choice of me as a confidant would have been ridiculous.”
<br> 
<br> “Just so,” Itash agreed. “Then she told you nothing?”
<br> 
<br> “Nothing at all.”
<br> 
<br> “Nor did she give you the impression that she had anything to tell?”
<br> 
<br> “She gave me no impression at all, except that she was rather a mysterious young person, suffering from an acute fit of jealousy.”
<br> 
<br> Itash rose slowly to his feet. He held out his hand.
<br> 
<br> “I apologise humbly, Mr. Slattery,” he said. “I see that I have been very foolish. Thank you for listening to me. I will go now.”
<br> 
<br> “You are not going to play?”
<br> 
<br> Itash shook his head sorrowfully.
<br> 
<br> “It would not be reverent. In a week or two, perhaps, if I am still here.”
<br> 
<br> He made his way towards the gate,—an odd figure, in his ceremonious black apparel. Susan looked after him curiously.
<br> 
<br> “Well, have you promised to let him have his girl back again?” she asked Grant, as he returned to her side.
<br> 
<br> “I have assured him that I am not a serious rival for her favours,” he rejoined. “The young man seems comforted.”
<br> 
<br> “Got your hands pretty full as it is, haven’t you?”
<br> 
<br> “Look here,” Grant said severely. “Kindly remember that I have just steered you to victory on the tennis courts, and in a day or two, if you behave yourself, I will be able to take you for a cruise in the Grey Lady. Incidentally I should be glad if you would further bear in mind the fact that I am a great many years your senior. A little more respect, please. Now, come along, and I’ll give you a lift down to the club for tea.”
<br> 
<br> “Thank you. I thought of going with Bobby.”
<br> 
<br> “You may have thought of it, but you are coming with me,” he insisted.
<br> 
<br> “Rather a bully, aren’t you?” she observed coolly. “However, perhaps I’d better. Bobby gets so affectionate in those little voitures,—thinks one needs steadying all the time. You’re above that sort of thing, aren’t you?”
<br> 
<br> “The springs of my Rolls-Royce,” he began
<br> 
<br> “Oh, bother the springs of your Rolls-Royce,” she interrupted. “I’m coming with you because I want to get to the club quickly and because I like your car.”
<br> 
<br> “The worst of being a millionaire!” Grant complained gloomily, as he took his place at the wheel. “One is tolerated only for one’s possessions.”
<br> 
<br> “They’re generally the best thing about a millionaire,” Susan declared. “All the same, if there were an unattached English one in the market, I think that I should like to marry him.”
<br> 
<br> “What’s the matter with a perfectly good American one?” he suggested.
<br> 
<br> “Entrancing idea, but illusionary,” she rejoined drily. “I hate syndicates, or rechauffes. I’m going in to tidy up. Grant. Try and get the round table in the corner.”
<br> 
<br> She jumped out and ran lightly up the steps. Grant backed his car to the pavement and was in the act of following her when the blue-liveried commissionaire, hat in hand, accosted him mysteriously.
<br> 
<br> “A young lady asked me to give you this as soon as you arrived, sir,” he announced, presenting a twisted-up half sheet of paper.
<br> 
<br> “Sure it’s for me?” Grant asked a little doubtfully.
<br> 
<br> “Mr. Grant Slattery,” the man declared. “The young person knew your name, sir.”
<br> 
<br> Grant thrust the note into his waistcoat pocket. He felt a curious conviction as to its source. To add a touch of coincidence to the affair, on the opposite side of the way, Itash was leaning over the wall, apparently watching the shipping in the harbour.
