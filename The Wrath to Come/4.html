He rang for his servant, ordered the wood fire to be replenished, exchanged his dinner coat for a smoking jacket, and lit a battered-looking briar pipe, which was the delight of his life. He was beginning to feel the need for a period of cool and impartial deliberation. For the last ten days he had been presiding over the meetings at Nice of the Pact of Nations, an organisation established in Paris in nineteen-thirty, and now, twenty years later, the guiding force of the world. Its bitterest critics—and, at its inauguration, there had been many—were forced now to admit that the Pact had become one of the brilliant successes of the century. Its conception had first been mooted at a Trade Conference at Genoa in nineteen-twenty-two, and its provisions, subsequently drawn up with the utmost care by a committee of European law makers, practically made war amongst its members impossible. France had been able to abandon herself at last to a sense of complete and luxurious security. Germany, admitted after some hesitation, had apparently been amongst its most law-abiding members. The Limitation of Armaments, the great pacific scheme initiated by the President of the United States early in nineteen-twenty-one, was still carried on as a separate institution but with numerous affiliations. There was only one great drawback to the Pact, one flaw alone which prevented its being the greatest association ever formed during the world’s history, and that drawback was the fact which, at the present moment, was giving both Grant Slattery and Lord Yeovil cause for the greatest apprehension. The United States, after a period of profound deliberation, during which great dissensions had arisen, had decided to be the one great power outside its influence. For the same reasons which had kept her for so long out of the war of nineteen-fourteen, she had reiterated her policy of self-determination and had once more declared Europe outside the sphere of her political interests. Her position had been the principal subject of discussion amongst statesmen and thinkers for many years. No administration, however, had been strong enough to change it, and it was universally accepted now as an unassailable attitude. She had ample justification for believing herself strong enough to fight her own battles and defend her own honour. Her position was in its way magnificent and evoked the florid and rhetorical praise of many of her own writers, especially those who were in any way Teutonic in their origin. Those who, like Grant Slattery, saw the sinister side of the situation, were few and their voices unheard in the great glad psalm of thanksgiving in which her Press, day by day, and month by month, glorified and exaggerated her unexampled and amazing prosperity. Without a doubt America had become the richest country in the world.
<br> 
<br> It was of America that Lord Yeovil, who had once been an exceedingly popular Ambassador at Washington, was thinking as he smoked his disreputable pipe, lounging in an easy-chair, his feet upon the fender. He had a profound respect for Grant Slattery, whose handling of various intricate matters, whilst First Secretary in London, had won his unqualified approval. The young man had seemed at that time assured of an ambassadorship, and his complete withdrawal from the Diplomatic Service had been a mystery even to his intimates. Lord Yeovil knew the reason for that withdrawal and was day by day growing more thoroughly to appreciate it. He was thinking of it now as he smoked his meditative pipe, wondering exactly how much real information Grant had picked up in Berlin, wondering, too, whether that small cloud which had already appeared on the political horizon was destined to seriously disturb the thirty years of peace.
<br> 
<br> The sound of wheels in the drive and the pealing of the bell broke into his reflections. He glanced at the clock. It was a few minutes past eleven,—an impossible hour for an ordinary caller. Presently Andrews, a young typist employed by his private secretary, knocked at the door and entered.
<br> 
<br> “I’m sorry to disturb you, sir,” he said, “but Baron Naga is here and asks if you will receive him.”
<br> 
<br> “Baron Naga!” the Prime Minister repeated in amazement. “At this hour of the night!”
<br> 
<br> “He seems to have come straight from Nice,” the young man confided.
<br> 
<br> “I will see him, unofficially, of course,—delighted. But what on earth is the urgency?”
<br> 
<br> “His Excellency gave me no intimation, sir.”
<br> 
<br> “You can show him in,” Lord Yeovil directed. “Explain that I’m out of harness and spending a quiet evening.”
<br> 
<br> Baron Naga himself was obviously paying no visit of ceremony. He had not changed his clothes for the evening and was wearing the frock coat and dark trousers in which he usually appeared at meetings of the Conference. His complexion was always rather more waxen than sallow, but to-night it seemed positively ghastly. His little formal bow before he advanced to shake hands was unsteady. A man of another race and different manner of life might have been suspected of drunkenness.
<br> 
<br> “My dear Baron!” Lord Yeovil said hospitably. “This is very friendly of you. I hope you do not bring me bad news. Sit down, please,” he invited.
<br> 
<br> The Ambassador sank into an easy-chair. He was most undoubtedly ill.
<br> 
<br> “I am much obliged to you, sir, for receiving me at this late hour,” he said. “My errand is of some importance. I have come to announce to you, in the first place, that my Imperial Master has accepted my resignation from the highly honourable post of Ambassador to Great Britain, and also, from the representation of Japan at the Pact of the Nations. I shall not, therefore, be attending the Meeting to-morrow.”
<br> 
<br> “God bless my soul!” Lord Yeovil exclaimed. “I regret very much to hear this.”
<br> 
<br> “Your lordship is very kind,” was the agitated reply. “Baron Katina is on his way from Berlin to take my place at the Pact of Nations, and Count Itash is already on the spot if anything of urgency should occur. My Imperial Master has not, I believe, as yet signified his wishes so far as regards my successor at St. James’s.”
<br> 
<br> “But, my dear Baron, this is most terrible news!” the other declared. “Most unexpected, too. It you will allow me to say so, there is no one with whom it has been a greater pleasure to work or whose loyal support during the past sessions of the Pact I have more appreciated.”
<br> 
<br> “You are very kind, Lord Yeovil, most gracious,” his visitor repeated, a little wistfully. “It has come to pass, however, that on a very vital matter I have found myself unable to conform to the desires and policy of those in whose hands the destiny of my country rests. It is a great grief to me.”
<br> 
<br> “I am sure it must be,” the Prime Minister assented, watching his visitor closely. “You have made me very curious. I was not aware that there was any subject of policy at present under consideration which could give scope for a difference of opinion of such drastic moment.”
<br> 
<br> “The greatest tragedy of this matter is now to come,” Baron Naga continued solemnly. “For my country’s sake I am here to betray her confidence. I shall place you, sir, in possession of certain information which, as President of the Pact of Nations, should be disclosed to you. After I have spoken, you will hear of me no more. It is for the ultimate good of Japan and my people—but for the moment the words I must speak are treason and for speaking them I must pay the price.”
<br> 
<br> Lord Yeovil was seriously disturbed. There was something in his visitor’s attitude and demeanour which were beyond his comprehension.
<br> 
<br> “But, my dear Baron.” he began
<br> 
<br> The Ambassador moved uneasily in his chair. There were blue lines under his eyes. It was more than ever obvious that he was very ill.
<br> 
<br> “A thousand pardons,” he interrupted weakly, “but I have perhaps underestimated the action—I am weaker than some of my years—listen, I implore you!”
<br> 
<br> Lord Yeovil hastened to the little sideboard and poured out a glass of brandy.
<br> 
<br> “Don’t distress yourself, Baron,” he begged. “You can tell me anything you wish to presently. I am always at your service. Drink this, please.”
<br> 
<br> Baron Naga clutched at the glass, clutched at his throat. He made a passionate attempt to speak. The words, however, were almost incomprehensible.
<br> 
<br> “Katina and—Lutrecht—America—the beginning—the great scheme—Itash knows—God of my parents!”
<br> 
<br> The glass rolled from his fingers. His head dropped forward. Lord Yeovil rushed to the bell.
<br> 
<br> “Telephone for a doctor,” he directed the butler, who answered it. “Baron Naga is ill.”
<br> 
<br> But Baron Naga was no longer ill. Both master and servant knew the truth as they stood and looked at the crumpled-up figure in the chair.
