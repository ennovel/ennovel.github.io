<p>"You began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas. "You were Mr. Bingley's first choice." </p> 
<p>"Yes; -- but he seemed to like his second better." </p> 
<p>"Oh! -- you mean Jane, I suppose -- because he danced with her twice. To be sure that did seem as if he admired her -- indeed I rather believe he did -- I heard something about it -- but I hardly know what -- something about Mr. Robinson." </p> 
<p>"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question -- "Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point."" </p> 
<p>"Upon my word! -- Well, that was very decided indeed -- that does seem as if -- but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know." </p> 
<p>"My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, Eliza," said Charlotte. "Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he? -- Poor Eliza! -- to be only just tolerable." </p> 
<p>"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips." </p> 
<p>"Are you quite sure, Ma'am? -- is not there a little mistake?" said Jane. -- "I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her." </p> 
<p>"Aye -- because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; -- but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to." </p> 
<p>"Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance. With them he is remarkably agreeable." </p> 
<p>"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was; every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise." </p> 
<p>"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I wish he had danced with Eliza." </p> 
<p>"Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with him, if I were you." </p> 
<p>"I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you never to dance with him." </p> 
<p>"His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend me so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a right to be proud." </p> 
<p>"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine." </p> 
<p>"Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, "is a very common failing I believe. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonimously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us." </p> 
<p>"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy," cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters, "I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day." </p> 
<p>"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs. Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle directly." </p>  
<p>距离浪博恩不远的地方，住着一家人家，这就是威廉·卢卡斯爵士府上。班纳特府上跟他们特别知已。爵士从前是在麦里屯做生意起家发迹的，曾在当市长的任内上书皇上，获得了一个爵士头衔；这个显要的身份使他觉得太荣幸，从此他就讨厌做生意，讨厌住在一个小镇上，于是歇了生意，告别小镇，带着家属迁到那离开麦里屯大约一英里路的一幢房子里去住，从那时候起就把那地方叫做卢家庄。他可以在这儿自得其乐，以显要自居，而且，既然摆脱了生意的纠缠，他大可以一心一意地从事社交活动。他尽管以自己的地位欣然自得，却并不因此而目空一切，反而对什么人都应酬得非常周到。他生来不肯得罪人，待人接物总是和蔼可亲，殷勤体贴，而且自从皇上觐见以来，更加彬彬有礼。卢卡斯太太是个很善良的女人，真是班纳特太太一位宝贵的邻居。卢府上有好几个孩子。大女儿是个明理懂事的年轻小姐，年纪大约二十六七岁，她是伊丽莎白的要好朋友。且说卢府上几位小姐跟班府上几位小姐这回非要见见面，谈谈这次跳舞会上的事业不可。于是在开完了跳舞会的第二天上午，卢府上的小姐们到浪博恩来跟班府上的小姐交换意见。 </p> 
<p>班纳特太太一看见卢卡斯小姐，便客客气气，从容不迫地说：“那天晚上全靠你开场开得好，你做了彬格莱先生的第一个意中人。”</p> 
<p>“是呀；可是他喜欢的倒是第二个意中人。”</p> 
<p>“哦，我想你是说吉英吧，因为他跟她跳了两次。看起来，他是真的爱上她呢──我的确相信他是真的──我听到了一些话──可是我弄不清究竟──我听到了一些有关鲁宾逊先生的话。”</p> 
<p>“说不定你指的是我喻听到他和鲁宾逊先生的谈话吧；我不是跟你说过了吗？鲁宾逊先生问他喜欢不喜欢我们麦里屯的跳舞会，问他是否觉得到场的女宾们中间有许多人很美，问他认为哪一个最美？他立刻回答了最后一个问题：“毫无问题是班纳特家的大小姐最美。关于这一点，人们决不会有别的看法。”</p> 
<p>“一定的！说起来，那的确成了定论啦──看上去的确象是──不过，也许会全部落空呢，你知道。”</p> 
<p>“我偷听到的话比你听到的要更有意思了，伊丽莎，”夏绿蒂说。“达西先生的话没有他朋友的话中听，可不是吗？可怜的伊丽莎！他不过认为她还可以！”</p> 
<p>“我请求你别叫丽萃想起了他这种无礼的举动又生起气来；他是那么讨厌的一个人，被他看上了才叫倒霉呢。郎格太太告诉我说，昨儿晚上他坐在她身边有半个钟头，可是始终不开口。”</p> 
<p>“你的话靠得住吗，妈妈？──一点儿没说错吗？”吉英说。“我清清楚楚看到达西先生跟她说话的。”</p> 
<p>“嘿──那是后来她问起他喜欢不喜欢尼日斐花园，他才不得不已敷衍了她一下；可是据她说，他似乎非常生气，好象怪她不该跟她说话似的。”</p> 
<p>“彬格莱小姐告诉我，”吉英说，“他从来不爱多说话，除非跟知已的朋友们谈谈。他对待知已朋友非常和蔼可亲。”</p> 
<p>“我跟本不相信这种话，要是他果真和蔼可亲，就该跟郎格太太说话啦。可是这里面的奥妙是可想而知的，大家都说他非常骄傲，他所以没跟郎格太太说话，或许是因为听到朗格太太连马车也没有一部，临时雇了车子来参加跳舞会吧。”</p> 
<p>“他没跟郎格太太说话，我倒不计较，”卢卡斯小姐说，“我只怪他当时没跟伊丽莎跳舞。”</p> 
<p>“丽萃，假如我是你，”她母亲说，“我下次偏不跟他跳舞。”</p> 
<p>“妈妈，我相信我可以万无一失地向你保证，我怎么也不跟他跳舞呢。”</p> 
<p>“他虽然骄傲，”卢卡斯小姐说，“可不象一般人的骄傲那样使我生气，因为他的骄傲还勉强说得过去。这么优秀的一个青年，门第好，又有钱，样样都比人家强，也难怪他要自以为了不起，照我的说法，他有权利骄傲。”</p> 
<p>“这倒是真话，”伊丽莎白回答道，“要是他没有触犯我的骄傲，我也很容易原谅他的骄傲。”</p> 
<p>“我以为骄傲是一般人的通病，”曼丽说。她觉得自己的见解很高明，因此提高了谈话的兴致。“从我所读过的许多书看来，我相信那的确是非常普遍的一种通病，人性特别容易趋向于这方面，简直谁都不免因为自己具有了某种品质而自命不凡。虚荣与骄傲是截然不同的两件事，尽管字面上常常当作同义词用，一个人可以骄傲而不虚荣。骄傲多半不外乎我们对我们自己的估价，虚荣却牵涉到我们希望别人对我们的看法。”卢家一个小哥儿（他是跟他姐姐们一起来的）忽然说道：“要是我也像达西先生那么有钱，我真不知道会骄傲到什么地步呢。我要养一群猎狗，还要每天喝一瓶酒。”班纳特太太说：“那你就喝得太过分啦，要量给我看见了，我就马上夺掉你的酒瓶。”那孩子抗议道，她不应该那样做；她接着又宣布了一遍，说她一定要那样，一场辩论直到客人告别时方才结束。</p>
