The Iwins are just coming." I shouted on seeing from the window three boys in blue overcoats, and followed by a young tutor, advancing along the pavement opposite our house.</p> 
<p>The Iwins were related to us, and of about the same age as ourselves. We had made their acquaintance soon after our arrival in Moscow. The second brother, Seriosha, had dark curly hair, a turned-up, strongly pronounced nose, very bright red lips (which, never being quite shut, showed a row of white teeth), beautiful dark-blue eyes, and an uncommonly bold expression of face. He never smiled but was either wholly serious or laughing a clear, merry, agreeable laugh. His striking good looks had captivated me from the first, and I felt an irresistible attraction towards him. Only to see him filled me with pleasure, and at one time my whole mental faculties used to be concentrated in the wish that I might do so. If three or four days passed without my seeing him I felt listless and ready to cry. Awake or asleep, I was forever dreaming of him. On going to bed I used to see him in my dreams, and when I had shut my eyes and called up a picture of him I hugged the vision as my choicest delight. So much store did I set upon this feeling for my friend that I never mentioned it to any one. Nevertheless, it must have annoyed him to see my admiring eyes constantly fixed upon him, or else he must have felt no reciprocal attraction, for he always preferred to play and talk with Woloda. Still, even with that I felt satisfied, and wished and asked for nothing better than to be ready at any time to make any sacrifice for him. Likewise, over and above the strange fascination which he exercised upon me, I always felt another sensation, namely, a dread of making him angry, of offending him, of displeasing him. Was this because his face bore such a haughty expression, or because I, despising my own exterior, over-rated the beautiful in others, or, lastly (and most probably), because it is a common sign of affection? At all events, I felt as much fear, of him as I did love. The first time that he spoke to me I was so overwhelmed with sudden happiness that I turned pale, then red, and could not utter a word. He had an ugly habit of blinking when considering anything seriously, as well as of twitching his nose and eyebrows. Consequently every one thought that this habit marred his face. Yet I thought it such a nice one that I involuntarily adopted it for myself, until, a few days after I had made his acquaintance, Grandmamma suddenly asked me whether my eyes were hurting me, since I was winking like an owl! Never a word of affection passed between us, yet he felt his power over me, and unconsciously but tyrannically, exercised it in all our childish intercourse. I used to long to tell him all that was in my heart, yet was too much afraid of him to be frank in any way, and, while submitting myself to his will, tried to appear merely careless and indifferent. Although at times his influence seemed irksome and intolerable, to throw it off was beyond my strength.</p> 
<p>I often think with regret of that fresh, beautiful feeling of boundless, disinterested love which came to an end without having ever found self-expression or return. It is strange how, when a child, I always longed to be like grown-up people, and yet how I have often longed, since childhood's days, for those days to come back to me! Many times, in my relations with Seriosha, this wish to resemble grown-up people put a rude check upon the love that was waiting to expand, and made me repress it. Not only was I afraid of kissing him, or of taking his hand and saying how glad I was to see him, but I even dreaded calling him "Seriosha" and always said "Sergius" as every one else did in our house. Any expression of affection would have seemed like evidence of childishness, and any one who indulged in it, a baby. Not having yet passed through those bitter experiences which enforce upon older years circumspection and coldness, I deprived myself of the pure delight of a fresh, childish instinct for the absurd purpose of trying to resemble grown-up people.</p> 
<p>I met the Iwins in the ante-room, welcomed them, and then ran to tell Grandmamma of their arrival with an expression as happy as though she were certain to be equally delighted. Then, never taking my eyes off Seriosha, I conducted the visitors to the drawing-room, and eagerly followed every movement of my favourite. When Grandmamma spoke to and fixed her penetrating glance upon him, I experienced that mingled sensation of pride and solicitude which an artist might feel when waiting for revered lips to pronounce a judgment upon his work.</p> 
<p>With Grandmamma's permission, the Iwins' young tutor, Herr Frost, accompanied us into the little back garden, where he seated himself upon a bench, arranged his legs in a tasteful attitude, rested his brass-knobbed cane between them, lighted a cigar, and assumed the air of a man well-pleased with himself. He was a, German, but of a very different sort to our good Karl Ivanitch. In the first place, he spoke both Russian and French correctly, though with a hard accent Indeed, he enjoyed--especially among the ladies--the reputation of being a very accomplished fellow. In the second place, he wore a reddish moustache, a large gold pin set with a ruby, a black satin tie, and a very fashionable suit. Lastly, he was young, with a handsome, self-satisfied face and fine muscular legs. It was clear that he set the greatest store upon the latter, and thought them beyond compare, especially as regards the favour of the ladies. Consequently, whether sitting or standing, he always tried to exhibit them in the most favourable light. In short, he was a type of the young German- Russian whose main desire is to be thought perfectly gallant and gentlemanly.</p> 
<p>In the little garden merriment reigned. In fact, the game of</p> 
<p>"robbers" never went better. Yet an incident occurred which came near to spoiling it. Seriosha was the robber, and in pouncing upon some travellers he fell down and knocked his leg so badly against a tree that I thought the leg must be broken. Consequently, though I was the gendarme and therefore bound to apprehend him, I only asked him anxiously, when I reached him, if he had hurt himself very much. Nevertheless this threw him into a passion, and made him exclaim with fists clenched and in a voice which showed by its faltering what pain he was enduring, "Why, whatever is the matter? Is this playing the game properly? You ought to arrest me. Why on earth don't you do so?" This he repeated several times, and then, seeing Woloda and the elder Iwin (who were taking the part of the travellers) jumping and running about the path, he suddenly threw himself upon them with a shout and loud laughter to effect their capture. I cannot express my wonder and delight at this valiant behaviour of my hero. In spite of the severe pain, he had not only refrained from crying, but had repressed the least symptom of suffering and kept his eye fixed upon the game! Shortly after this occurrence another boy, Ilinka Grap, joined our party. We went upstairs, and Seriosha gave me an opportunity of still further appreciating and taking delight in his manly bravery and fortitude. This was how it was.</p> 
<p>Ilinka was the son of a poor foreigner who had been under certain obligations to my Grandpapa, and now thought it incumbent upon him to send his son to us as frequently as possible. Yet if he thought that the acquaintance would procure his son any advancement or pleasure, he was entirely mistaken, for not only were we anything but friendly to Ilinka, but it was seldom that we noticed him at all except to laugh at him. He was a boy of thirteen, tall and thin, with a pale, birdlike face, and a quiet, good-tempered expression. Though poorly dressed, he always had his head so thickly pomaded that we used to declare that on warm days it melted and ran down his neck. When I think of him now, it seems to me that he was a very quiet, obliging, and good- tempered boy, but at the time I thought him a creature so contemptible that he was not worth either attention or pity.</p> 
<p>Upstairs we set ourselves to astonish each other with gymnastic tours de force. Ilinka watched us with a faint smile of admiration, but refused an invitation to attempt a similar feat, saying that he had no strength.</p> 
<p>Seriosha was extremely captivating. His face and eyes glowed with laughter as he surprised us with tricks which we had never seen before. He jumped over three chairs put together, turned somersaults right across the room, and finally stood on his head on a pyramid of Tatistchev's dictionaries, moving his legs about with such comical rapidity that it was impossible not to help bursting with merriment.</p> 
<p>After this last trick he pondered for a moment (blinking his eyes as usual), and then went up to Ilinka with a very serious face.</p> 
<p>"Try and do that," he said. "It is not really difficult."</p> 
<p>Ilinka, observing that the general attention was fixed upon him, blushed, and said in an almost inaudible voice that he could not do the feat.</p> 
<p>"Well, what does he mean by doing nothing at all? What a girl the fellow is! He has just GOT to stand on his head," and Seriosha, took him by the hand.</p> 
<p>"Yes, on your head at once! This instant, this instant!" every one shouted as we ran upon Ilinka and dragged him to the dictionaries, despite his being visibly pale and frightened.</p> 
<p>"Leave me alone! You are tearing my jacket!" cried the unhappy victim, but his exclamations of despair only encouraged us the more. We were dying with laughter, while the green jacket was bursting at every seam.</p> 
<p>Woloda and the eldest Iwin took his head and placed it on the dictionaries, while Seriosha, and I seized his poor, thin legs (his struggles had stripped them upwards to the knees), and with boisterous, laughter held them uptight--the youngest Iwin superintending his general equilibrium.</p> 
<p>Suddenly a moment of silence occurred amid our boisterous laughter--a moment during which nothing was to be heard in the room but the panting of the miserable Ilinka. It occurred to me at that moment that, after all, there was nothing so very comical and pleasant in all this.</p> 
<p>"Now, THAT'S a boy!" cried Seriosha, giving Ilinka a smack with his hand. Ilinka said nothing, but made such desperate movements with his legs to free himself that his foot suddenly kicked Seriosha in the eye: with the result that, letting go of Ilinka's leg and covering the wounded member with one hand, Seriosha hit out at him with all his might with the other one. Of course Ilinka's legs slipped down as, sinking exhausted to the floor and half-suffocated with tears, he stammered out:</p> 
<p>"Why should you bully me so?"</p> 
<p>The poor fellow's miserable figure, with its streaming tears, ruffled hair, and crumpled trousers revealing dirty boots, touched us a little, and we stood silent and trying to smile,</p> 
<p>Seriosha was the first to recover himself.</p> 
<p>"What a girl! What a gaby!" he said, giving Ilinka a slight kick. "He can't take things in fun a bit. Well, get up, then."</p> 
<p>"You are an utter beast! That's what YOU are!" said Ilinka, turning miserably away and sobbing.</p> 
<p>"Oh, oh! Would it still kick and show temper, then?" cried Seriosha, seizing a dictionary and throwing it at the unfortunate boy's head. Apparently it never occurred to Ilinka to take refuge from the missile; he merely guarded his head with his hands.</p> 
<p>"Well, that's enough now," added Seriosha, with a forced laugh. "You DESERVE to be hurt if you can't take things in fun. Now let's go downstairs."</p> 
<p>I could not help looking with some compassion at the miserable creature on the floor as, his face buried in the dictionary, he lay there sobbing almost as though he were in a fit.</p> 
<p>"Oh, Sergius!" I said. "Why have you done this?"</p> 
<p>"Well, you did it too! Besides, I did not cry this afternoon when I knocked my leg and nearly broke it."</p> 
<p>"True enough," I thought. "Ilinka is a poor whining sort of a chap, while Seriosha is a boy--a REAL boy."</p> 
<p>It never occurred to my mind that possibly poor Ilinka was suffering far less from bodily pain than from the thought that five companions for whom he may have felt a genuine liking had, for no reason at all, combined to hurt and humiliate him.</p> 
<p>I cannot explain my cruelty on this occasion. Why did I not step forward to comfort and protect him? Where was the pitifulness which often made me burst into tears at the sight of a young bird fallen from its nest, or of a puppy being thrown over a wall, or of a chicken being killed by the cook for soup?</p> 
<p>Can it be that the better instinct in me was overshadowed by my affection for Seriosha and the desire to shine before so brave a boy? If so, how contemptible were both the affection and the desire! They alone form dark spots on the pages of my youthful recollections.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“沃洛佳，沃洛佳！伊文家的孩子们来了！”我从窗口看到三个穿着水獭皮领的蓝大衣的男孩子，就喊叫道。他们跟着一个漂亮的年青教师，从对面的人行道向我们家走来。</p> 
<p>伊文家的孩子们是我们的亲戚，和我们年纪相仿；我们到莫斯科不久就同他们熟识了，跟他们很合得来。</p> 
<p>伊文家的第二个孩子，谢辽沙，是一个皮肤黝黑的鬈发男孩，长着倔强的小小的翘鼻子，十分鲜润的红嘴唇很少能完全盖住他那有点突出的洁白的上牙，深蓝色的眼睛非常漂亮，面部表情异常活泼。他从来不微笑，不是显得非常严肃，就是尽情大笑，发出一种响亮、清脆、非常动人的笑声。乍一见，他那独特的美就使我吃惊；我情不自禁地被他迷住了。看见他就足以使我高兴；有个时期，我的全副精力都集中到这种愿望上，隔三、四天不见他，我就感到寂寞，忧郁得要哭。我的一切梦想，不管是醒着还是做梦，都是关于他的。临睡前，我希望梦见他；合上眼睛，我就看见他在我面前，我把这种幻想当作最大的乐趣。这种感情我不能向世上的任何人吐露，我是那么珍重它。也许因为他讨厌我那不安的眼神不断地凝视他，或者只是因为他对我并没有好感，他分明更愿意跟沃洛佳玩耍和聊天，而不愿意同我在一起；尽管如此，我还是心满意足，毫无奢望，毫无所求，情愿为他牺牲一切。除了他在我心头引起的这种热情的迷恋以外，他一来还在我心中引起另一种同样强烈的情绪，那就是怕惹他不快，怕得罪他，或者使他不高兴。也许因为他脸上有一种傲慢的神情，或者因为我瞧不起自己的外表，过分重视别人美的优点，或者更确切地说，因为这是爱的必然征侯，我多么爱他，就多么怕他。谢辽沙第一次同我讲话时，我因为受宠若惊，脸上一阵红一阵白，什么也回答不上来。他有个坏习惯，在他想心事的时候，总把眼睛盯在一个地方，翘着鼻子，扬着眉毛，一个劲儿地眨眼睛。大家都觉得，他的这种习惯大大损坏了他的容貌，但是我却觉得这是那么可爱，不由得也养成了同样的习惯，我同他认识了几天之后，外祖母就问我是不是眼睛疼，因为我象只猫头鹰似地眨着眼睛。我们之间没有谈过一句爱慕的话；但是他感觉到他有力量控制我，于是就在我们童稚的关系上，不自觉地，但是暴虐地运用这种权力；而我，尽管渴望向他倾吐心曲，但是因为太怕他，不敢公开说出来；只装出好象不在意的样子，毫无怨言地服从他。有时我觉得他的权威太大，令人难以忍受；但是我却无力摆脱。</p> 
<p>这种无私的、无限的、新鲜而美好的感情，没有倾吐出来，没有获得同情就破灭了，想起来真令人难过。</p> 
<p>奇怪的是，不知为什么在我小的时候，我极力装得象个大人；而当我已经不再是小孩的时候，我又希望象个孩子。在同谢辽沙的关系上，我不愿意象个孩子，这种愿望常遏止了那种要倾诉的感情，使我变得虚假起来。我不但不敢吻他（尽管有时我非常想这样做），不敢拉他的手，也不敢讲我看见他是多么高兴，甚至也不敢叫他谢辽沙，总是叫谢尔盖 ① ，这成了我们的规矩。每一种感情的流露都证明行为的幼稚，谁要犯这种过错，那他就还是个孩子。还没有尝到那种使成年人在待人接物上谨慎小心，冷酷无情的痛苦滋味，因为仅仅是出于要模仿大人的奇怪的愿望，我们就使自己失去了那种温柔的、天真眷恋的纯洁的快乐。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>①谢辽沙：谢尔盖的小名。</p> 
<p>我在仆人房里就遇见伊文家的孩子们，向他们问好之后，就匆匆忙忙跑去通知外祖母，告诉她伊文家的人来了，我说话的口气，好象这消息一定会使她十分高兴似的。随后，就目不转睛地盯着谢辽沙，跟着他走进客厅，注视着他的一举一动。当外祖母说他长大了好多，用她那敏锐的眼光打量他的时候，我体会到那种又是害怕又是期待的心清，就象一个艺术家等待一位可敬的鉴赏家对他的作品下判断时的心清一样。</p> 
<p>伊文家年青的家庭教师 Herr Frosl ① ，得到外祖母的许可，同我们一起到花园里去。他坐在绿凳子上，很神气地架起腿来，把他那包着青铜头的手杖挟在两腿中间，带着非常欣赏自己举止的人的神气，点上一支雪茄烟。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>①Herr Frost：德语“弗劳斯特先生”。</p> 
<p>Herr Frost是德国人，但是与我们心地善良的卡尔·伊凡内奇完全不一样。首先，他俄语说得很正确，而法语发音却很糟；他在一般人中间，特别是在妇女中间，享有博学多识的名声。其次，他留着两撇红色小胡子，把围巾的两端塞到背带下面，在围巾上别着一杖红宝石扣针，他穿着一条闪光的、镶着饰带的淡蓝色裤子。第三，他很年青，仪表堂堂、沾沾自喜，长着两条优美的、肌肉发达的大腿。他分明特别看重最后这个优点，认为它对女性的吸引力是无法抗拒的，想必是为了这种目的，总是设法把他的腿摆在最惹人注目的地方，不论坐着或站着，总一个劲儿抖动着小腿肚。他是一个典型俄罗斯式的德国青年，一心想做风流人物和花花公子。</p> 
<p>我们在花园里玩得有意思极了，捉强盗的游戏玩得再好也没有；但是出了一件事，几乎破坏了一切。谢辽沙做强盗：他追逐旅客的时候，绊了一跤，猛地把膝头撞在树干上，撞得那么厉害，我简直以为他把膝头撞碎了。尽管我是宪兵，我的责任是要逮住他，但我却走上前去，关切地问他痛不痛。谢辽沙很生我的气；他攥着拳头，顿着脚，用一种明明证实他懂得很痛的声音对我喊道：</p> 
<p>“咳，这是怎么回事？怎么能这样玩法！喂，你为什么不捉我？你为什么不提我？”他说了好几遍，斜眼望着在小路上一边跳一边跑着、扮演旅客的沃洛佳和伊文家的老大；随后突然尖叫一声，大笑着跑去捉他们。</p> 
<p>我无法表达这种英雄行为使我多么惊异和迷惑：尽管疼得要命，他不但没有哭一声，甚至没有露出疼痛的模样，一会儿都没有忘了游戏的事。</p> 
<p>过了不久，当伊林卡·格拉普加入我们这一伙，我们在吃午饭前一起上楼去的时候，谢辽沙又有个机会以他那惊人的勇气和坚强的性格命名我倍加惊异，倍加迷惑。</p> 
<p>伊林卡·格拉普是一个穷外国人的儿子，他父亲以前曾经在我外祖父家住过，受过他的恩惠，因此认为现在常常打发他的儿子来看望我们是他应尽的义务。如果他认为他的儿子同我们来往能够获得一些尊敬和乐趣，那他就大错特错了，因为我们不但不跟伊林卡要好，而且我们只有在想拿他寻开心的时候才理睬他。伊林卡·格拉普是个大约十三岁的男孩，身材瘦长，脸色苍白，脸长得象鸟脸，表情善良温顺。他衣着十分寒酸，可是头发却总涂着很厚一层生发油，以致我们相信，大晴天他头上的生发油一定会融化，会滴到他的短外套上。现在我回忆起他的时候，我觉得他是一个非常殷勤、安静善良的男孩；但是当时我却觉得他是那么一个不足挂齿的人，不值得同情，甚至不值得去想他。</p> 
<p>玩完捉强盗的游戏，我们就上楼去，开始玩闹，互相炫耀种种体育上的玩艺。伊林卡带着胆怯而惊奇的笑容观看着我们，当我们邀请他也来露一手的时候，他就推托说他一点力气也没有。谢辽沙可爱极了；他脱掉短外套，容光焕发，眼睛闪闪发光，他不断地哈哈大笑，发明一些新把戏；跳过三把并排摆着的椅子，满屋子翻筋斗，把塔奇雪夫编的辞典摆在屋子中间当托架，在上面拿大顶，同时两只脚还做了一些滑稽得要命的动作，使人不能不发笑。玩过这最后一套把戏，他思索了一下，眨眨眼睛，带着十分正经的神情突然走到伊林卡面前，说：“试试这个吧，真的，这并不难。”格拉普见大家都注意看着他，脸就红了，用几乎听不见的声音说他怎么也做不来这个。</p> 
<p>“哦，真的，他为什么一点也不愿意表演呢？他又不是个姑娘……一定要他拿个大顶！”</p> 
<p>于是谢辽沙拉住他的手。</p> 
<p>“一定，一定要拿个大顶！”我们异口同声喊道，把伊林卡包围起来，他那时显然吓了一跳，脸色发白了。我们揪住他的胳臂，把他拉到辞典那里。</p> 
<p>“放开我，我自己来！你们会把我的衣眼撒破的！”那个不幸的受难者喊道。但是这种绝望的喊叫使人们更来劲。我们笑得要死。他的绿色短上衣的衣缝全都绽开了。</p> 
<p>沃洛佳和伊文家的老大把他的头按下去，放在辞典上；我和谢辽沙就揪住那个可怜孩子的乱踢乱蹬的细腿，把他的裤腿卷到膝头上，大笑着把他的腿举上去，伊文家最小的孩子扶着他，使他的全身保持平衡。</p> 
<p>大笑了一阵以后，我们突然都沉默下来，屋里是那么寂静，只听见可怜的格拉普沉重的喘息声。在这一瞬间，我完全不相信这一切是很好玩、很可笑的事。</p> 
<p>“哦，现在你是个好汉了！”谢辽沙拍了他一巴掌说。</p> 
<p>伊林卡默不作声，乱踢乱蹬，拚命要挣脱身子。在他不顾死活地乱踢乱蹬的当儿，他的鞋后跟猛地踢着了谢辽沙的眼睛，谢辽沙疼得立刻放下他的腿，一边捂住不由自主地落下泪来的眼睛，一边用力推了伊林卡一把。伊林卡不再由我们扶着，象一具没有生命的东西一样嘭的一声倒在地上，被泪水噎得只能嘟囔说：</p> 
<p>“你们为什么欺侮我？”</p> 
<p>可怜的伊林卡，满面泪痕，头发蓬乱，裤腿卷着，从裤腿下面露出他那没有擦油的靴筒，他这副惨相打动了我们的心；我们都默不作声了，极力勉强笑着。</p> 
<p>首先镇静下来的是谢辽沙。</p> 
<p>“老娘们！好哭的家伙！”他说，用脚轻轻地踢了踢伊林卡。“简直不能同他开玩笑……喂，得啦，起来吧！”</p> 
<p>“我告诉你，你是个坏孩子！”伊林卡恶狠狠地说，走到一边，大声痛哭起来。</p> 
<p>“哎呀，他用鞋后跟踢入，还破口大骂！”谢辽沙大叫一声，用手抓住那本辞典，就在那个不幸的男孩头上挥舞，那个男孩甚至都不想法自卫，只用手抱着头。</p> 
<p>“瞧你！瞧你！要是他连开玩笑都不懂，我们就不要他……下楼去吧。”谢辽沙说着，不自然地笑了起来。</p> 
<p>我同情地望了望那个可怜的男孩，他躺到地板上，把脸藏在辞典中间，哭得那么伤心，好象再哭一阵，那种使他全身抽搐的呜咽就会送他的命。</p> 
<p>“唉，谢辽沙！”我对他说，“你为什么来这一手？”</p> 
<p>“这很好啊！……今天我险些儿把骨头跌断了，我都没有哭。”</p> 
<p>“是的，这是实情，”我暗自沉思，“伊林卡只不过是个好哭的家伙，而谢辽沙才是个好汉……他是个多么了不起的好汉啊！……”</p> 
<p>我并没有考虑到，那个可怜的男孩所以哭，很可能不是因为肉体上的痛苦，而是因为他想到，也许是他很喜欢的这五个男孩，竟会无原无故地串通一气来憎恶人，欺侮他。</p> 
<p>我简直无法说明我的行为是多么残酷。我为什么不走上前去，保护他，安慰他呢？我一看见一只从巢里被扔出去的小乌鸦，或者一只被扔到篱笆外的小狗，或者被小厨子捉去做汤的一只母鸡，就会哽咽着大声哭泣，现在把那份同情心丢到哪儿去了呢？</p> 
<p>难道由于我对谢辽沙的爱和想在他的眼里显得跟他一样勇敢的愿望，这样美好的感情就被窒息了吗？这种爱和想充好汉的愿望毕竟是不值得羡慕的啊！它们在我童年的回忆上留下了唯一的污点。</p>
