Yet, as soon as ever Jakoff himself began to talk, they flew here, there, and everywhere with lightning rapidity. These movements always appeared to me an index of Jakoff's secret thoughts, though his face was invariably placid, and expressive alike of dignity and submissiveness, as who should say, "I am right, yet let it be as you wish." On seeing us, Papa said, "Directly--wait a moment," and looked towards the door as a hint for it to be shut.</p> 
<p>"Gracious heavens! What can be the matter with you to-day, Jakoff?" he went on with a hitch of one shoulder (a habit of his). "This envelope here with the 800 roubles enclosed,"--Jacob took out a set of tablets, put down "800" and remained looking at the figures while he waited for what was to come next--"is for expenses during my absence. Do you understand? From the mill you ought to receive 1000 roubles. Is not that so? And from the Treasury mortgage you ought to receive some 8000 roubles. From the hay--of which, according to your calculations, we shall be able to sell 7000 poods [The pood = 40 lbs.]at 45 copecks a piece</p> 
<p>there should come in 3000, Consequently the sum-total that you ought to have in hand soon is--how much?--12,000 roubles. Is that right?"</p> 
<p>"Precisely," answered Jakoff, Yet by the extreme rapidity with which his fingers were twitching I could see that he had an objection to make. Papa went on:</p> 
<p>"Well, of this money you will send 10,000 roubles to the Petrovskoe local council, As for the money already at the office, you will remit it to me, and enter it as spent on this present date." Jakoff turned over the tablet marked "12,000," and put down "21,000"--seeming, by his action, to imply that 12,000 roubles had been turned over in the same fashion as he had turned the tablet. "And this envelope with the enclosed money," concluded Papa, "you will deliver for me to the person to whom it is addressed."</p> 
<p>I was standing close to the table, and could see the address. It was "To Karl Ivanitch Mayer." Perhaps Papa had an idea that I had read something which I ought not, for he touched my shoulder with his hand and made me aware, by a slight movement, that I must withdraw from the table. Not sure whether the movement was meant for a caress or a command, I kissed the large, sinewy hand which rested upon my shoulder.</p> 
<p>"Very well," said Jakoff. "And what are your orders about the accounts for the money from Chabarovska?" (Chabarovska was Mamma's village.)</p> 
<p>"Only that they are to remain in my office, and not to be taken thence without my express instructions."</p> 
<p>For a minute or two Jakoff was silent. Then his fingers began to twitch with extraordinary rapidity, and, changing the expression of deferential vacancy with which he had listened to his orders for one of shrewd intelligence, he turned his tablets back and spoke.</p> 
<p>"Will you allow me to inform you, Peter Alexandritch," he said, with frequent pauses between his words, "that, however much you wish it, it is out of the question to repay the local council now. You enumerated some items, I think, as to what ought to come in from the mortgage, the mill, and the hay (he jotted down each of these items on his tablets again as he spoke)." Yet I fear that we must have made a mistake somewhere in the accounts." Here he paused a while, and looked gravely at Papa.</p> 
<p>"How so?"</p> 
<p>"Well, will you be good enough to look for yourself? There is the account for the mill. The miller has been to me twice to ask for time, and I am afraid that he has no money whatever in hand. He is here now. Would you like to speak to him?"</p> 
<p>"No. Tell me what he says," replied Papa, showing by a movement of his head that he had no desire to have speech with the miller,</p> 
<p>"Well, it is easy enough to guess what he says. He declares that there is no grinding to be got now, and that his last remaining money has gone to pay for the dam. What good would it do for us to turn him out? As to what you were pleased to say about the mortgage, you yourself are aware that your money there is locked up and cannot be recovered at a moment's notice. I was sending a load of flour to Ivan Afanovitch to-day, and sent him a letter as well, to which he replies that he would have been glad to oblige you, Peter Alexandritch, were it not that the matter is out of his hands now, and that all the circumstances show that it would take you at least two months to withdraw the money. From the hay I understood you to estimate a return of 3000 roubles?" (Here Jakoff jotted down "3000" on his tablets, and then looked for a moment from the figures to Papa with a peculiar expression on his face.) "Well, surely you see for yourself how little that is? And even then we should lose if we were to sell the stuff now, for you must know that--"</p> 
<p>It was clear that he would have had many other arguments to adduce had not Papa interrupted him,</p> 
<p>"I cannot make any change in my arrangements," said Papa. "Yet if there should REALLY have to be any delay in the recovery of these sums, we could borrow what we wanted from the Chabarovska funds."</p> 
<p>"Very well, sir." The expression of Jakoff's face and the way in which he twitched his fingers showed that this order had given him great satisfaction. He was a serf, and a most zealous, devoted one, but, like all good bailiffs, exacting and parsimonious to a degree in the interests of his master. Moreover, he had some queer notions of his own. He was forever endeavouring to increase his master's property at the expense of his mistress's, and to prove that it would be impossible to avoid using the rents from her estates for the benefit of Petrovskoe (my father's village, and the place where we lived). This point he had now gained and was delighted in consequence.</p> 
<p>Papa then greeted ourselves, and said that if we stayed much longer in the country we should become lazy boys; that we were growing quite big now, and must set about doing lessons in earnest,</p> 
<p>"I suppose you know that I am starting for Moscow to-night?" he went on, "and that I am going to take you with me? You will live with Grandmamma, but Mamma and the girls will remain here. You know, too, I am sure, that Mamma's one consolation will be to hear that you are doing your lessons well and pleasing every one around you."</p> 
<p>The preparations which had been in progress for some days past had made us expect some unusual event, but this news left us thunderstruck, Woloda turned red, and, with a shaking voice, delivered Mamma's message to Papa.</p> 
<p>"So this was what my dream foreboded!" I thought to myself. "God send that there come nothing worse!" I felt terribly sorry to have to leave Mamma, but at the same rejoiced to think that I should soon be grown up, "If we are going to-day, we shall probably have no lessons to do, and that will be splendid, However, I am sorry for Karl Ivanitch, for he will certainly be dismissed now. That was why that envelope had been prepared for him. I think I would almost rather stay and do lessons here than leave Mamma or hurt poor Karl. He is miserable enough already."</p> 
<p>As these thoughts crossed my mind I stood looking sadly at the black ribbons on my shoes, After a few words to Karl Ivanitch about the depression of the barometer and an injunction to Jakoff not to feed the hounds, since a farewell meet was to be held after luncheon, Papa disappointed my hopes by sending us off to lessons--though he also consoled us by promising to take us out hunting later.</p> 
<p>On my way upstairs I made a digression to the terrace. Near the door leading on to it Papa's favourite hound, Milka, was lying in the sun and blinking her eyes.</p> 
<p>"Miloshka," I cried as I caressed her and kissed her nose, we are going away today. Good-bye. Perhaps we shall never see each other again." I was crying and laughing at the same time.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>他站在写字台前，指着一些信封、文件和几堆钱，神情焦躁，激动地对管家雅柯夫·米哈伊洛夫说明什么，管家站在他一向站的房门和晴雨表之间，反剪着双手，手指很快地乱动着。</p> 
<p>爸爸愈是急躁，管家的手指就动得愈快，反过来，爸爸不做声了，他的手指也就不动了。当雅柯夫自己开始讲话的时候，他的手指又极不安宁地拚命向四面乱动弹。从手指的动作上，我觉得可以猜测出雅柯夫内心的思想。他的神情总是很沉着，这说明他既意识到自己的尊严，同时也意识到自己是受人管的，这就是说：“我是对的，不过随您的便吧！”</p> 
<p>爸爸看见我们，只说了一声：</p> 
<p>“等一下，马上就完。”</p> 
<p>接着用头示意，叫我们中间的一个人关上门。</p> 
<p>“啊，慈悲的上帝啊！你今天是怎么回事，雅柯夫？”他继续对管家说着，耸了耸一边的肩膀（这是他的习惯）。“这只装着八百卢布的信封……”</p> 
<p>雅柯夫把算盘拉近一些，用算盘珠拨出八百这个数字，眼睛盯着一个不明确的地方，等着听下文。</p> 
<p>“……用来做我出门时的花销。你明白吗？从磨坊那里你可以收到一千卢布……对不对？你可以从国库收回八千卢布押金；干草，按照你自己的估计，可以出卖七千普特，就算四十五个戈比一普特，你可以收到三千卢布；这样一来，你总共可以收到多少钱？一万二千卢布……是不是？”</p> 
<p>“是的，”雅柯夫说。</p> 
<p>但是，根据他的飞快地动弹的手指来看，我觉察出他要提出异议。爸爸打断了他的话头。</p> 
<p>“好吧，你要代彼得洛夫斯科耶庄园寄一万卢布给委员会。帐房里存的钱，”爸爸接下去说（（雅柯夫把他在算盘上拨出来的一万二千抹掉，打上二万一千），“你现在给我拿来，就算今天支出好了。（雅柯夫又抹掉算盘珠儿，把算盘翻转，想必是以此表示那二万一千卢布也没有了。）这个装着钱的信封，你要给我按照上面写的地址转交。”</p> 
<p>我站得离桌子很近，因此瞟了瞟信封上的字。上面写着：“卡尔·伊凡内奇·毛叶尔。”</p> 
<p>爸爸大概注意到我看了我不应该知道的东西，就把手放到我的肩头上，轻轻把我从桌边推开。我不了解这是爱抚还是斥责，但是不管怎样，我还是吻了吻搭在我肩头的那只青筋嶙嶙的大手。</p> 
<p>“是！”雅柯夫说。“关于哈巴洛夫卡那笔钱，您有什么吩咐吗？”</p> 
<p>哈巴洛夫卡是妈妈的庄园。</p> 
<p>“存在帐房里，没有我的命令，绝对不准动用。”</p> 
<p>雅柯夫沉默了几秒钟；接着，他的手指突然动得更快了。他在聆听主人命令时那副呆头呆脑、唯命是从的样子变了，又露出精明滑头的本相来。他把算盘拉近些，开口说：</p> 
<p>“让我向您报告一下，彼得·亚历山德雷奇，您可以随意处理，不过委员会那笔钱不能如期付清。您会说，”他抑扬顿挫地继续说，“从押金、磨坊、干草上我们应该收到一笔进项……（他一边说这些项目，一边在算盘上打出数字来。）不过我看，这些款项怕是我们算错了。”他沉默了一会儿，意味深长地看了爸爸一眼，这样补充了一句。</p> 
<p>“为什么？”</p> 
<p>“您瞧呀：关于磨坊的事，磨坊老板已经来找过我两次，要求延期付款，赌咒发誓，一口咬定他没有钱……他现在就在这儿，您是不是愿意亲自同他谈谈？”</p> 
<p>“他说什么？”爸爸追问道，摇了摇头，表示他不想同磨坊老板谈话。</p> 
<p>“这不是明摆着的嘛！他说根本没有生意，他仅有的那一点点钱都用在水坝上了。假定我们把他赶走，老爷，我们又会得到什么好处呢？你又提到押金，我好象已经向您报告过了，我们的钱投到那里，不会很快收回来的。前几天我往城里给伊凡·阿凡纳西奇运去一车面粉，顺便捎信问起这件事。可是，他老人家的回信又是那一套：‘我很高兴为彼得·亚历山德雷奇效劳，但是事情由不得我做主，’从这一切情况看来，再过两个月，您也未必收得到这笔款。至于您所说的干草，假定可以卖到三千卢布……”</p> 
<p>他把算盘珠拨上三千，沉默了一下，一会儿看看算盘，一会儿又看看爸爸的眼睛，仿佛说：</p> 
<p>“您自己看看，这太少了！再说，卖干草还得赔本；如果现在我们就卖出去，您自己不知道……”</p> 
<p>看样子，他还有一大堆理由。大概就是因为这个缘故爸爸没有让他再说下去：</p> 
<p>“我不改变自己的决定，”他说，“不过，如果这些款项当真要拖延好久才能收到，那也没有办法，需要多少钱，你就动用哈巴洛夫卡那笔钱好了。”</p> 
<p>“是！”</p> 
<p>从雅柯夫的脸色和手指的动作可以看出，最后这个命令使他非常满意。</p> 
<p>雅柯夫原来是个农奴，为人非常勤恳，忠心耿耿。他象所有的好管家一样，很会香自己的主人精打细算，对主人的利益抱着非常古怪的见解。他总是千方百计地减损女主人的财产来增加男主人的财产，因此就极力证明，非动用女主人庄园的一切收入来贴补彼得洛夫斯科耶（就是我们居住的村庄）不可。这时他扬扬得意，因为在这一点上他完全如愿以偿了。</p> 
<p>爸爸跟我们道过早安以后，就说，我们在乡下闲散够了，我们不再是孩子，应该认真学习了。</p> 
<p>“我想，你们已经知道我今天夜里要去莫斯科，而且要把你们带去，”他说。“你们要住在外祖母家，妈妈跟女孩子们留在这儿。你们要知道，听到你们学习成绩很好，令人满意，这对妈妈将是一种安慰。”</p> 
<p>虽然由于最近几天所做的准备，我们已经料到要发生什么不寻常的事，但是这个消息还是使我们大吃一惊。沃洛佳脸红了，用颤抖的声音传达了妈妈让捎的话。</p> 
<p>“我的梦给我的原来就是这个预兆！”我寻思了一下。“千万别发生更糟心的事了。”</p> 
<p>我非常，非常舍不得妈妈，但同时，一想到我们真的成了大人，心里又很高兴。</p> 
<p>“如果我们今天就走，那就一定不上课了。这太妙了！”我暗自思索。“可是，我替卡尔·伊凡内奇难过。他大概会被辞退，要不然，就不会给他准备那个封套了……最好还是永远学习下去，不要走，不要离开妈妈，也不要让可怜的卡尔·伊凡内奇伤心。他本来就够不幸的了。”</p> 
<p>这些思想掠过我的心头；我一动也不动，目不转睛地望着我鞋上的黑蝴蝶结。</p> 
<p>爸爸同卡尔·伊凡内奇又谈了几句关于晴雨表下降的事，吩咐雅柯夫不要喂狗，好在临走以前，吃过午饭去试一试小猎狗。这以后，跟我的预料相反，他打发我们去上课，不过安慰我们说，要带我们去打猎。</p> 
<p>我上楼时，顺便跑到凉台上去看看，爸爸心爱的猎狗米尔卡正眯缝着眼睛，卧在门口晒太阳。</p> 
<p>“亲爱的米尔卡，”我抚摩着它，吻它的小脸说，“我们今天就要走了。再见吧！我们再也不会见面了。”</p> 
<p>我心一软，就哭了起来。</p>
