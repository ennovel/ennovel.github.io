Woloda began working diligently, but I was too distracted to do anything at all. For a long while I stared vacantly at the book; but tears at the thought of the impending separation kept rushing to my eyes and preventing me from reading a single word. When at length the time came to repeat the dialogues to Karl (who listened to us with blinking eyes--a very bad sign), I had no sooner reached the place where some one asks, "Wo kommen Sie her?" ("Where do you come from?") and some one else answers him, "lch komme vom Kaffeehaus" ("I come from the coffee-house"), than I burst into tears and, for sobbing, could not pronounce, "Haben Sie die Zeitung nicht gelesen?" (Have you not read the newspaper?") at all. Next, when we came to our writing lesson, the tears kept falling from my eyes and, making a mess on the paper, as though some one had written on blotting- paper with water, Karl was very angry. He ordered me to go down upon my knees, declared that it was all obstinacy and " puppet- comedy playing" (a favourite expression of his) on my part, threatened me with the ruler, and commanded me to say that I was sorry. Yet for sobbing and crying I could not get a word out. At last--conscious, perhaps, that he was unjust--he departed to Nicola's pantry, and slammed the door behind him. Nevertheless their conversation there carried to the schoolroom.</p> 
<p>"Have you heard that the children are going to Moscow, Nicola?" said Karl.</p> 
<p>"Yes. How could I help hearing it?"</p> 
<p>At this point Nicola seemed to get up for Karl said, "Sit down, Nicola," and then locked the door. However, I came out of my corner and crept to the door to listen.</p> 
<p>"However much you may do for people, and however fond of them you may be, never expect any gratitude, Nicola," said Karl warmly. Nicola, who was shoe-cobbling by the window, nodded his head in assent.</p> 
<p>"Twelve years have I lived in this house," went on Karl, lifting his eyes and his snuff-box towards the ceiling, "and before God I can say that I have loved them, and worked for them, even more than if they had been my own children. You recollect, Nicola, when Woloda had the fever? You recollect how, for nine days and nights, I never closed my eyes as I sat beside his bed? Yes, at that time I was 'the dear, good Karl Ivanitch'--I was wanted then; but now"--and he smiled ironically--"the children are growing up, and must go to study in earnest. Perhaps they never learnt anything with me, Nicola? Eh?"</p> 
<p>"I am sure they did," replied Nicola, laying his awl down and straightening a piece of thread with his hands.</p> 
<p>"No, I am wanted no longer, and am to be turned out. What good are promises and gratitude? Natalia Nicolaevna"--here he laid his hand upon his heart--"I love and revere, but what can SHE I do here? Her will is powerless in this house."</p> 
<p>He flung a strip of leather on the floor with an angry gesture. "Yet I know who has been playing tricks here, and why I am no longer wanted. It is because I do not flatter and toady as certain people do. I am in the habit of speaking the truth in all places and to all persons," he continued proudly, "God be with these children, for my leaving them will benefit them little, whereas I--well, by God's help I may be able to earn a crust of bread somewhere. Nicola, eh?"</p> 
<p>Nicola raised his head and looked at Karl as though to consider whether he would indeed be able to earn a crust of bread, but he said nothing. Karl said a great deal more of the same kind--in particular how much better his services had been appreciated at a certain general's where he had formerly lived (I regretted to hear that). Likewise he spoke of Saxony, his parents, his friend the tailor, Schonheit (beauty), and so on.</p> 
<p>I sympathised with his distress, and felt dreadfully sorry that he and Papa (both of whom I loved about equally) had had a difference. Then I returned to my corner, crouched down upon my heels, and fell to thinking how a reconciliation between them might be effected.</p> 
<p>Returning to the study, Karl ordered me to get up and prepare to write from dictation. When I was ready he sat down with a dignified air in his arm-chair, and in a voice which seemed to come from a profound abyss began to dictate: "Von al-len Lei- den-shaf-ten die grau-samste ist. Have you written that? " He paused, took a pinch of snuff, and began again: "Die grausamste ist die Un-dank-bar-keit [The most cruel of all passions is ingratitude.] a capital U, mind."</p> 
<p>The last word written, I looked at him, for him to go on,</p> 
<p>"Punctum" (stop), he concluded, with a faintly perceptible smile, as he signed to us to hand him our copy-books.</p> 
<p>Several times, and in several different tones, and always with an expression of the greatest satisfaction, did he read out that sentence, which expressed his predominant thought at the moment, Then he set us to learn a lesson in history, and sat down near the window. His face did not look so depressed now, but, on the contrary, expressed eloquently the satisfaction of a man who had avenged himself for an injury dealt him.</p> 
<p>By this time it was a quarter to one o'clock, but Karl Ivanitch never thought of releasing us, He merely set us a new lesson to learn. My fatigue and hunger were increasing in equal proportions, so that I eagerly followed every sign of the approach of luncheon. First came the housemaid with a cloth to wipe the plates, Next, the sound of crockery resounded in the dining-room, as the table was moved and chairs placed round it, After that, Mimi, Lubotshka, and Katenka. (Katenka was Mimi's daughter, and twelve years old) came in from the garden, but Foka (the servant who always used to come and announce luncheon) was not yet to be seen. Only when he entered was it lawful to throw one's books aside and run downstairs.</p> 
<p>Hark! Steps resounded on the staircase, but they were not Foka's. Foka's I had learnt to study, and knew the creaking of his boots well. The door opened, and a figure unknown to me made its appearance,</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>卡尔·伊凡内奇情绪不佳。这从他那皱紧的眉头，从他把大礼服抛进五屉柜，怒气冲冲地系腰带，用指甲使劲在《会话课本》上划一条线，标明我们要背熟的地方等等动作来看，都可以看得出。沃洛佳规规矩矩地学习，我却心里烦躁，什么也做不出来。我茫然若失地对《会话课本》望了好久。但是一想到就要离别，我便热泪盈眶，再也读不下去了。轮到我向卡尔·伊凡内奇说那段会话的时候，他眯缝着眼睛听我说（这是一种不祥的兆头）。恰恰到一个人问：“Wo kommen sie her？” ① 另一个回答说：“Ich komme vom Kaffe—Hause”的地方 ② ，我再也忍不住眼泪，由于痛哭失声，就说不出：“Haben Sie die Zeitung nicht gelesen？” ③ 这句话来了。到习字的时候，泪水落到纸上，弄得满纸墨斑，看上去好象是用水在包装纸上写的。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>①“Wo kommen sie her？”：德语“您从哪里来？”</p> 
<p>②“Ich komme vom kaffe-Hause”：德语“我从咖啡馆里来。”</p> 
<p>③“Haben sie die zeitung nicht gelesen？”：德语“您没有看过报吗？”</p> 
<p>卡尔·伊凡内奇生起气来，罚我跪下。反复地说，这是倔脾气，装腔作势（这是他的口头禅），用戒尺威吓我，要我讨饶，我却被泪水哽住了。连一个字也说不出来。最后，一他大概感到自己做事不公平，就走进尼古拉的房间，砰的一声把门关上。</p> 
<p>从教室里可以听到下房里的谈话。</p> 
<p>“孩子们要去莫斯科，你听说了吧，尼古拉？”卡尔·伊凡内奇一进屋就说。</p> 
<p>“不错，听说了。”</p> 
<p>想必是尼古拉要站起来，因为卡尔·伊凡内奇说；“坐着吧，尼古拉！”随后就关上门。我离开墙角，走到门边去偷听。</p> 
<p>“不论替人家做了多少好事，不论多么忠心耿耿，看起来，决不能指望人家感激你。尼古拉，对不对？”卡尔·伊凡内奇感伤地说。</p> 
<p>坐在窗口补靴子的尼古拉，肯定地点点头。</p> 
<p>“我在这所房子里住了十二年，我可以当着上帝起誓，尼古拉，”卡尔·伊凡内奇接着说，’朝天花板抬起眼睛和鼻烟壶，“我爱护他们，照顾他们，比对自己的孩子都尽心。你记得吧，尼古拉，沃洛佳害热病的时候，你记得我怎样在他的床边坐了九天没有合眼。是的，那时我是个好心的人。是亲爱的卡尔·伊凡内奇；那时用得着我。可是现在呢，”他含着一丝讽刺的笑意补充说，“现在孩子长大了，得认真学习了！好象他们在这儿没有学习似的。尼古拉，是不是？”</p> 
<p>“好象还得学习，”尼古拉放下锥子，双手拉着麻绳说。</p> 
<p>“是的，现在用不着我了，要把我赶走了；诺言丢到哪儿去啦？哪儿有感激的意思？尼古拉呀，我很敬爱娜达丽雅·尼古拉耶芙娜，”他一只手按着胸口说，“但是她又怎样呢？……在这所房子里，她的意旨反正是无足轻重的。”这时，他用一种富于表情的手势，把一小片碎皮子扔到地板上。“我知道这是谁出的鬼主意，为什么不需要我了。因为我不会象有些人那样阿谀逢迎，随声附和。我对任何人都总爱讲老实话，”他骄傲地说。“别去管他们！我不在这里，他们也发不了财。而我呢，上帝是慈悲的，总会找到一块面包的……是不是，尼古拉？”</p> 
<p>尼古拉抬起头，看了看卡尔‘伊凡内奇，好象想弄清他是不是真的会找到一块面包。不过，他一句话也没有说。</p> 
<p>卡尔·伊凡内奇照这样又唠叨了很久，说了好多。他提到，他以前住在某将军家里，他的功劳得到了较好的报酬（听见这话，我心里难过），他说到萨克森、他的父母、他的朋友会恩海特裁缝，等等，等等。</p> 
<p>我很同情他的痛苦。我对父亲和卡尔·伊凡内奇几乎是同样敬爱的，一想到他们互不理解，心里就很难过：我又回到角落里跪下，考虑怎样才可以使他们言归于好。</p> 
<p>卡尔·伊凡内奇回到教室以后，吩咐我站起来，准备默写的练习本。等一切都准备就绪，他就威严地坐在自己的安乐椅上，用一种仿佛发自内心深处的声音开始口授：“Von al—len Lei—den一schaf—ten die grau—samste ist……haben s ie geschrie—ben？ ① ”说到这儿，他停了一停，慢吞吞地吸了一撮鼻烟，打起精神接着说：“Die grausamste ist die Un—dank—bar—keit……Ein grossesU ② ”。我等着他往下说，写好最后一个字之后，向他望了一眼。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>①“Von al－len lei-den-schaf-ten die grau-samste ist……baben sie geschrie-ben？”：德语“在一切缺点中，最可怕的……写好了吗？”</p> 
<p>②“Die grausamste ist die undank-bar-keit……Ein grosses U”：德语“最可怕的是忘恩负义……”U要大写。</p> 
<p>“Punctum ① ，”他含着一丝几乎觉察不出的微笑说，然后做了一个手势，要我们把练习本交给他。</p> 
<p>--------</p> 
<p>①Punctum：德语“句点”。</p> 
<p>他用抑扬顿挫的声调，带着极其满意的神情把这句表达自己内心思想的格，读了好几遍。随后，他就坐在窗口给我们上历史课。他的脸色不象先前那么阴沉了，流露出一个已经充分出了气的人的得意神情。</p> 
<p>差一刻就一点钟了；但是，卡尔‘伊凡内奇好象还不想放我们走：他接连不断地给我们上新课。无聊和食欲同样地增长起来。我急不可耐地注意着表明快吃午饭的一切迹象。一会儿一个女仆拿着擦子去刷碟子，一会儿听见饭厅里餐具的响声和挪动桌椅地声音，一会儿米米、柳博奇卡和卡简卡（卡简卡是米米的女儿，十二岁）从花园里走进来。但是福加——总是来宣布开饭的管家福加——却没有露面。只有他露面的时候，我们才能扔下书本，不顾卡尔·伊凡内奇，跑下楼去。</p> 
<p>这回听见楼梯上的脚步声了；但这并不是福加，我熟悉他的脚步声，永远听得出他的靴子的咯吱声。门打开了，一个我完全不认识的人出现在门口。</p>
