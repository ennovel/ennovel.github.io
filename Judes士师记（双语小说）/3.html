<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now these are the nations which the Lord kept in the land for the purpose of testing Israel by them, all those who had had no experience of all the wars of Canaan; 
<br>3:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 好 叫 以 色 列 的 后 代 又 知 道 又 学 习 未 曾 晓 得 的 战 事 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Only because of the generations of the children of Israel, for the purpose of teaching them war--only those who up till then had no experience of it; 
<br>3:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 所 留 下 的 就 是 非 利 士 的 五 个 首 领 和 一 切 迦 南 人 ， 西 顿 人 ， 并 住 利 巴 嫩 山 的 希 未 人 ， 从 巴 力 黑 们 山 直 到 哈 马 口 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The five chiefs of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites and the Zidonians and the Hivites living in Mount Lebanon, from the mountain Baal-hermon as far as Hamath: 
<br>3:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 留 下 这 几 族 ， 为 要 试 验 以 色 列 人 ， 知 道 他 们 肯 听 从 耶 和 华 借 摩 西 吩 咐 他 们 列 祖 的 诫 命 不 肯 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For the purpose of testing Israel by them, to see if they would give ear to the orders of the Lord, which he had given to their fathers by the hand of Moses. 
<br>3:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 色 列 人 竟 住 在 迦 南 人 ， 赫 人 ， 亚 摩 利 人 ， 比 利 洗 人 ， 希 未 人 ， 耶 布 斯 人 中 间 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now the children of Israel were living among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites: 
<br>3:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 娶 他 们 的 女 儿 为 妻 ， 将 自 己 的 女 儿 嫁 给 他 们 的 儿 子 ， 并 事 奉 他 们 的 神 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And they took as wives the daughters of these nations and gave their daughters to their sons, and became servants to their gods. 
<br>3:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 色 列 人 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 ， 忘 记 耶 和 华 他 们 的 神 ， 去 事 奉 诸 巴 力 和 亚 舍 拉 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the children of Israel did evil in the eyes of the Lord, and put out of their minds the Lord their God, and became servants to the Baals and the Astartes. 
<br>3:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 所 以 耶 和 华 的 怒 气 向 以 色 列 人 发 作 ， 就 把 他 们 交 在 米 所 波 大 米 王 古 珊 利 萨 田 的 手 中 。 以 色 列 人 服 事 古 珊 利 萨 田 八 年 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So the wrath of the Lord was burning against Israel, and he gave them up into the hands of Cushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia; and the children of Israel were his servants for eight years. 
<br>3:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 色 列 人 呼 求 耶 和 华 的 时 候 ， 耶 和 华 就 为 他 们 兴 起 一 位 拯 救 者 救 他 们 ， 就 是 迦 勒 兄 弟 基 纳 斯 的 儿 子 俄 陀 聂 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when the children of Israel made prayer to the Lord, he gave them a saviour, Othniel, the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother. 
<br>3:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 和 华 的 灵 降 在 他 身 上 ， 他 就 作 了 以 色 列 的 士 师 ， 出 去 争 战 。 耶 和 华 将 米 所 波 大 米 王 古 珊 利 萨 田 交 在 他 手 中 ， 他 便 胜 了 古 珊 利 萨 田 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the spirit of the Lord came on him and he became judge of Israel, and went out to war, and the Lord gave up Cushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia, into his hands and he overcame him. 
<br>3:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 国 中 太 平 四 十 年 。 基 纳 斯 的 儿 子 俄 陀 聂 死 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then for forty years the land had peace, till the death of Othniel, the son of Kenaz. 
<br>3:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 色 列 人 又 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 ， 耶 和 华 就 使 摩 押 王 伊 矶 伦 强 盛 ， 攻 击 以 色 列 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the children of Israel again did evil in the eyes of the Lord; and the Lord made Eglon, king of Moab, strong against Israel, because they had done evil in the Lord's eyes. 
<br>3:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 伊 矶 伦 招 聚 亚 扪 人 和 亚 玛 力 人 ， 去 攻 打 以 色 列 人 ， 占 据 棕 树 城 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Eglon got together the people of Ammon and Amalek, and they went and overcame Israel and took the town of palm-trees. 
<br>3:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 以 色 列 人 服 事 摩 押 王 伊 矶 伦 十 八 年 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the children of Israel were servants to Eglon, king of Moab, for eighteen years. 
<br>3:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 色 列 人 呼 求 耶 和 华 的 时 候 ， 耶 和 华 就 为 他 们 兴 起 一 位 拯 救 者 ， 就 是 便 雅 悯 人 基 拉 的 儿 子 以 笏 。 他 是 左 手 便 利 的 。 以 色 列 人 托 他 送 礼 物 给 摩 押 王 伊 矶 伦 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then when the children of Israel made prayer to the Lord, he gave them a saviour, Ehud, the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man; and the children of Israel sent an offering by him to Eglon, king of Moab. 
<br>3:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 笏 打 了 一 把 两 刃 的 剑 ， 长 一 肘 ， 带 在 右 腿 上 衣 服 里 面 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So Ehud made himself a two-edged sword, a cubit long, which he put on at his right side under his robe. 
<br>3:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 将 礼 物 献 给 摩 押 王 伊 矶 伦 ， 原 来 伊 矶 伦 极 其 肥 胖 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he took the offering to Eglon, king of Moab, who was a very fat man. 
<br>3:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 笏 献 完 礼 物 ， 便 将 抬 礼 物 的 人 打 发 走 了 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And after giving the offering, he sent away the people who had come with the offering. 
<br>3:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 自 己 却 从 靠 近 吉 甲 凿 石 之 地 回 来 ， 说 ， 王 阿 ， 我 有 一 件 机 密 事 奏 告 你 。 王 说 ， 回 避 吧 。 于 是 左 右 侍 立 的 人 都 退 去 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But he himself, turning back from the stone images at Gilgal, said, I have something to say to you in secret, O king. And he said, Let there be quiet. Then all those who were waiting before him went out. 
<br>3:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 笏 来 到 王 面 前 。 王 独 自 一 人 坐 在 凉 楼 上 。 以 笏 说 ， 我 奉 神 的 命 报 告 你 一 件 事 。 王 就 从 座 位 上 站 起 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Ehud came in to him while he was seated by himself in his summer-house. And Ehud said, I have a word from God for you. And he got up from his seat. 
<br>3:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 笏 便 伸 左 手 ， 从 右 腿 上 拔 出 剑 来 ， 刺 入 王 的 肚 腹 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Ehud put out his left hand, and took the sword from his right side, and sent it into his stomach; 
<br>3:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 连 剑 把 都 刺 进 去 了 。 剑 被 肥 肉 夹 住 ， 他 没 有 从 王 的 肚 腹 拔 出 来 ， 且 穿 通 了 后 身 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the hand-part went in after the blade, and the fat was joined up over the blade; for he did not take the sword out of his stomach. And he went out into the ... 
<br>3:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 笏 就 出 到 游 廊 ， 将 楼 门 尽 都 关 锁 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Ehud went out into the covered way, shutting the doors of the summer-house on him and locking them. 
<br>3:24 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 笏 出 来 之 后 ， 王 的 仆 人 到 了 ， 看 见 楼 门 关 锁 ， 就 说 ， 他 必 是 在 楼 上 大 解 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now when he had gone, the king's servants came, and saw that the doors of the summer-house were locked; and they said, It may be that he is in his summer-house for a private purpose. 
<br>3:25 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 等 烦 了 ， 见 仍 不 开 楼 门 ， 就 拿 钥 匙 开 了 ， 不 料 ， 他 们 的 主 人 已 死 ， 倒 在 地 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And they went on waiting till they were shamed, but the doors were still shut; so they took the key, and, opening them, saw their lord stretched out dead on the floor. 
<br>3:26 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 耽 延 的 时 候 ， 以 笏 就 逃 跑 了 ， 经 过 凿 石 之 地 ， 逃 到 西 伊 拉 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But Ehud had got away while they were waiting and had gone past the stone images and got away to Seirah. 
<br>3:27 [hgb]&nbsp; 到 了 ， 就 在 以 法 莲 山 地 吹 角 。 以 色 列 人 随 着 他 下 了 山 地 ， 他 在 前 头 引 路 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when he came there, he had a horn sounded in the hill-country of Ephraim, and all the children of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he at their head. 
<br>3:28 [hgb]&nbsp; 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 随 我 来 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 已 经 把 你 们 的 仇 敌 摩 押 人 交 在 你 们 手 中 。 于 是 他 们 跟 着 他 下 去 ， 把 守 约 旦 河 的 渡 口 ， 不 容 摩 押 一 人 过 去 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said to them, Come after me; for the Lord has given the Moabites, your haters, into your hands. So they went down after him and took the crossing-places of Jordan against Moab, and let no one go across. 
<br>3:29 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 时 击 杀 了 摩 押 人 约 有 一 万 ， 都 是 强 壮 的 勇 士 ， 没 有 一 人 逃 脱 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; At that time they put about ten thousand men of Moab to the sword, every strong man and every man of war; not a man got away. 
<br>3:30 [hgb]&nbsp; 这 样 ， 摩 押 就 被 以 色 列 人 制 伏 了 。 国 中 太 平 八 十 年 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So Moab was broken that day under the hand of Israel. And for eighty years the land had peace. 
<br>3:31 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 笏 之 后 ， 有 亚 拿 的 儿 子 珊 迦 ， 他 用 赶 牛 的 棍 子 打 死 六 百 非 利 士 人 。 他 也 救 了 以 色 列 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And after him came Shamgar, the son of Anath, who put to death six hundred Philistines with an ox-stick; and he was another saviour of Israel.
