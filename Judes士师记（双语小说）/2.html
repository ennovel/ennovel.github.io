<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now the angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, *** I took you out of Egypt, guiding you into the land which I gave by an oath to your fathers; and I said, My agreement with you will never be broken by me: 
<br>2:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 们 也 不 可 与 这 地 的 居 民 立 约 ， 要 拆 毁 他 们 的 祭 坛 。 你 们 竟 没 有 听 从 我 的 话 。 为 何 这 样 行 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And you are to make no agreement with the people of this land; you are to see that their altars are broken down: but you have not given ear to my voice: what have you done? 
<br>2:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 因 此 我 又 说 ， 我 必 不 将 他 们 从 你 们 面 前 赶 出 。 他 们 必 作 你 们 肋 下 的 荆 棘 。 他 们 的 神 必 作 你 们 的 网 罗 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And so I have said, I will not send them out from before you; but they will be a danger to you, and their gods will be a cause of falling to you. 
<br>2:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 和 华 的 使 者 向 以 色 列 众 人 说 这 话 的 时 候 ， 百 姓 就 放 声 而 哭 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now on hearing these words which the angel of the Lord said to all the children of Israel, the people gave themselves up to loud crying and weeping. 
<br>2:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 给 那 地 方 起 名 叫 波 金 （ 就 是 哭 的 意 思 ） 。 众 人 在 那 里 向 耶 和 华 献 祭 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the LORD. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And they gave that place the name of Bochim, and made offerings there to the Lord. 
<br>2:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 从 前 约 书 亚 打 发 以 色 列 百 姓 去 的 时 候 ， 他 们 各 归 自 己 的 地 业 ， 占 据 地 土 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Joshua let the people go away, and the children of Israel went, every man to his heritage, to take the land for themselves. 
<br>2:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 书 亚 在 世 和 约 书 亚 死 后 ， 那 些 见 耶 和 华 为 以 色 列 人 所 行 大 事 的 长 老 还 在 的 时 候 ， 百 姓 都 事 奉 耶 和 华 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the people were true to the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the responsible men who were still living after the death of Joshua, and had seen all the great work of the Lord which he had done for Israel. 
<br>2:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 和 华 的 仆 人 ， 嫩 的 儿 子 约 书 亚 ， 正 一 百 一 十 岁 就 死 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And death came to Joshua, the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, he being a hundred and ten years old. 
<br>2:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 色 列 人 将 他 葬 在 他 地 业 的 境 内 ， 就 是 在 以 法 莲 山 地 的 亭 拿 希 烈 ， 在 迦 实 山 的 北 边 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And they put his body in the earth in the land of his heritage in Timnath-heres, in the hill-country of Ephraim to the north of Mount Gaash. 
<br>2:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 世 代 的 人 也 都 归 了 自 己 的 列 祖 。 后 来 有 别 的 世 代 兴 起 ， 不 知 道 耶 和 华 ， 也 不 知 道 耶 和 华 为 以 色 列 人 所 行 的 事 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And in time death overtook all that generation; and another generation came after them, having no knowledge of the Lord or of the things which he had done for Israel. 
<br>2:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 色 列 人 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 ， 去 事 奉 诸 巴 力 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the children of Israel did evil in the eyes of the Lord and became servants to the Baals; 
<br>2:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 离 弃 了 领 他 们 出 埃 及 地 的 耶 和 华 他 们 列 祖 的 神 ， 去 叩 拜 别 神 ， 就 是 四 围 列 国 的 神 ， 惹 耶 和 华 发 怒 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And they gave up the Lord, the God of their fathers, who had taken them out of the land of Egypt, and went after other gods, the gods of the peoples round about them, worshipping them and moving the Lord to wrath. 
<br>2:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 并 离 弃 耶 和 华 ， 去 事 奉 巴 力 和 亚 斯 他 录 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And they gave up the Lord, and became the servants of Baal and the Astartes. 
<br>2:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 和 华 的 怒 气 向 以 色 列 人 发 作 ， 就 把 他 们 交 在 抢 夺 他 们 的 人 手 中 ， 又 将 他 们 付 与 四 围 仇 敌 的 手 中 ， 甚 至 他 们 在 仇 敌 面 前 再 不 能 站 立 得 住 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the wrath of the Lord was burning against Israel, and he gave them up into the hands of those who violently took their property, and into the hands of their haters all round them, so that they were forced to give way before them. 
<br>2:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 无 论 往 何 处 去 ， 耶 和 华 都 以 灾 祸 攻 击 他 们 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 所 说 的 话 ， 又 如 耶 和 华 向 他 们 所 起 的 誓 。 他 们 便 极 其 困 苦 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Wherever they went out, the hand of the Lord was against them for evil, as the Lord had taken his oath it would be; and things became very hard for them. 
<br>2:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 和 华 兴 起 士 师 ， 士 师 就 拯 救 他 们 脱 离 抢 夺 他 们 人 的 手 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the Lord gave them judges, as their saviours from the hands of those who were cruel to them. 
<br>2:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 却 不 听 从 士 师 ， 竟 随 从 叩 拜 别 神 ， 行 了 邪 淫 ， 速 速 地 偏 离 他 们 列 祖 所 行 的 道 ， 不 如 他 们 列 祖 顺 从 耶 和 华 的 命 令 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did not so. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But still they would not give ear to their judges, but went after other gods and gave them worship; quickly turning from the way in which their fathers had gone, keeping the orders of the Lord; but they did not do so. 
<br>2:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 和 华 为 他 们 兴 起 士 师 ， 就 与 那 士 师 同 在 。 士 师 在 世 的 一 切 日 子 ， 耶 和 华 拯 救 他 们 脱 离 仇 敌 的 手 。 他 们 因 受 欺 压 扰 害 ， 就 哀 声 叹 气 ， 所 以 耶 和 华 后 悔 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And whenever the Lord gave them judges, then the Lord was with the judge, and was their saviour from the hands of their haters all the days of the judge; for the Lord was moved by their cries of grief because of those who were cruel to them. 
<br>2:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 及 至 士 师 死 后 ， 他 们 就 转 去 行 恶 ， 比 他 们 列 祖 更 甚 ， 去 事 奉 叩 拜 别 神 ， 总 不 断 绝 顽 梗 的 恶 行 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But whenever the judge was dead, they went back and did more evil than their fathers, going after other gods, to be their servants and their worshippers; giving up nothing of their sins and their hard-hearted ways. 
<br>2:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 耶 和 华 的 怒 气 向 以 色 列 人 发 作 。 他 说 ， 因 这 民 违 背 我 吩 咐 他 们 列 祖 所 守 的 约 ， 不 听 从 我 的 话 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the wrath of the Lord was burning against Israel, and he said, Because this nation has not been true to my agreement which I made with their fathers, and has not given ear to my voice; 
<br>2:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 所 以 约 书 亚 死 的 时 候 所 剩 下 的 各 族 ， 我 必 不 再 从 他 们 面 前 赶 出 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; From now on I will not go on driving out from before them any of the nations which at the death of Joshua were still living in this land; 
<br>2:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 为 要 借 此 试 验 以 色 列 人 ， 看 他 们 肯 照 他 们 列 祖 谨 守 遵 行 我 的 道 不 肯 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; In order to put Israel to the test, and see if they will keep the way of the Lord, walking in it as their fathers did, or not. 
<br>2:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 这 样 耶 和 华 留 下 各 族 ， 不 将 他 们 速 速 赶 出 ， 也 没 有 交 付 约 书 亚 的 手 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So the Lord let those nations go on living in the land, not driving them out quickly, and did not give them up into the hands of Joshua.
