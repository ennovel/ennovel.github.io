<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah, of the daughters of the Philistines; 
<br>14:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 参 孙 上 来 禀 告 他 父 母 说 ， 我 在 亭 拿 看 见 一 个 女 子 ， 是 非 利 士 人 的 女 儿 ， 愿 你 们 给 我 娶 来 为 妻 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when he came back he said to his father and mother, I have seen a woman in Timnah, of the daughters of the Philistines: get her now for me for my wife. 
<br>14:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 父 母 说 ， 在 你 弟 兄 的 女 儿 中 ， 或 在 本 国 的 民 中 ， 岂 没 有 一 个 女 子 ， 何 至 你 去 在 未 受 割 礼 的 非 利 士 人 中 娶 妻 呢 ？ 参 孙 对 他 父 亲 说 ， 愿 你 给 我 娶 那 女 子 ， 因 我 喜 悦 她 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then his father and mother said to him, Is there no woman among the daughters of your relations or among all my people, that you have to go for your wife to the Philistines, who are without circumcision? But Samson said to his father, Get her for me, for she is pleasing to me. 
<br>14:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 的 父 母 却 不 知 道 这 事 是 出 于 耶 和 华 ， 因 为 他 找 机 会 攻 击 非 利 士 人 。 那 时 ， 非 利 士 人 辖 制 以 色 列 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now his father and mother had no knowledge that this was the purpose of the Lord, who had the destruction of the Philistines in mind. Now the Philistines at that time were ruling over Israel. 
<br>14:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 参 孙 跟 他 父 母 下 亭 拿 去 ， 到 了 亭 拿 的 葡 萄 园 ， 见 有 一 只 少 壮 狮 子 向 他 吼 叫 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Samson went down to Timnah (and his father and his mother,) and came to the vine-gardens of Timnah; and a young lion came rushing out at him. 
<br>14:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 和 华 的 灵 大 大 感 动 参 孙 ， 他 虽 然 手 无 器 械 ， 却 将 狮 子 撕 裂 ， 如 同 撕 裂 山 羊 羔 一 样 。 他 行 这 事 并 没 有 告 诉 父 母 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the spirit of the Lord came on him with power, and, unarmed as he was, pulling the lion in two as one might do to a young goat, he put him to death; (but he said nothing to his father and mother of what he had done.) 
<br>14:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 参 孙 下 去 与 女 子 说 话 ， 就 喜 悦 她 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So he went down and had talk with the woman; and she was pleasing to Samson. 
<br>14:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 过 了 些 日 子 ， 再 下 去 要 娶 那 女 子 ， 转 向 道 旁 要 看 死 狮 ， 见 有 一 群 蜂 子 和 蜜 在 死 狮 之 内 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then after a time he went back to take her; and turning from the road to see the dead body of the lion, he saw a mass of bees in the body of the lion, and honey there. 
<br>14:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 就 用 手 取 蜜 ， 且 吃 且 走 。 到 了 父 母 那 里 ， 给 他 父 母 ， 他 们 也 吃 了 。 只 是 没 有 告 诉 这 蜜 是 从 死 狮 之 内 取 来 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he took the honey in his hand, and went on, tasting it on the way; and when he came to his father and mother he gave some to them; but did not say that he had taken the honey from the body of the lion. 
<br>14:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 父 亲 下 去 见 女 子 。 参 孙 在 那 里 设 摆 筵 宴 ， 因 为 向 来 少 年 人 都 有 这 个 规 矩 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Samson went down to the woman, and made a feast there, as was the way among young men. 
<br>14:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 众 人 看 见 参 孙 ， 就 请 了 三 十 个 人 陪 伴 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he took thirty friends, and they were with him. 
<br>14:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 参 孙 对 他 们 说 ， 我 给 你 们 出 一 个 谜 语 ， 你 们 在 七 日 筵 宴 之 内 ， 若 能 猜 出 意 思 告 诉 我 ， 我 就 给 你 们 三 十 件 里 衣 ， 三 十 套 衣 裳 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Samson said, Now I have a hard question for you: if you are able to give me the answer before the seven days of the feast are over, I will give you thirty linen robes and thirty changes of clothing; 
<br>14:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 们 若 不 能 猜 出 意 思 告 诉 我 ， 你 们 就 给 我 三 十 件 里 衣 ， 三 十 套 衣 裳 。 他 们 说 ， 请 将 谜 语 说 给 我 们 听 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But if you are not able to give me the answer, then you will have to give me thirty linen robes and thirty changes of clothing. And they said to him, Put your hard question and let us see what it is. 
<br>14:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 参 孙 对 他 们 说 ， 吃 的 从 吃 者 出 来 。 甜 的 从 强 者 出 来 。 他 们 三 日 不 能 猜 出 谜 语 的 意 思 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said, Out of the taker of food came food, and out of the strong came the sweet. And at the end of three days they were still not able to give the answer. 
<br>14:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 到 第 七 天 ， 他 们 对 参 孙 的 妻 说 ， 你 诓 哄 你 丈 夫 ， 探 出 谜 语 的 意 思 告 诉 我 们 ， 免 得 我 们 用 火 烧 你 和 你 父 家 。 你 们 请 了 我 们 来 ， 是 要 夺 我 们 所 有 的 吗 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So on the fourth day they said to Samson's wife, Get from your husband the answer to his question by some trick or other, or we will have you and your father's house burned with fire; did you get us here to take all we have? 
<br>14:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 参 孙 的 妻 在 丈 夫 面 前 啼 哭 说 ， 你 是 恨 我 ， 不 是 爱 我 ， 你 给 我 本 国 的 人 出 谜 语 ， 却 没 有 将 意 思 告 诉 我 。 参 孙 回 答 说 ， 连 我 父 母 我 都 没 有 告 诉 ， 岂 可 告 诉 你 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Samson's wife, weeping over him, said, Truly you have no love for me but only hate; you have put a hard question to the children of my people and have not given me the answer. And he said to her, See, I have not given the answer even to my father or my mother; am I to give it to you? 
<br>14:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 七 日 筵 宴 之 内 ， 她 在 丈 夫 面 前 啼 哭 ， 到 第 七 天 逼 着 他 ， 他 才 将 谜 语 的 意 思 告 诉 他 妻 ， 他 妻 就 告 诉 本 国 的 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And all the seven days of the feast she went on weeping over him; and on the seventh day he gave her the answer, because she gave him no peace; and she sent word of it to the children of her people. 
<br>14:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 到 第 七 天 ， 日 头 未 落 以 前 ， 那 城 里 的 人 对 参 孙 说 ， 有 什 么 比 蜜 还 甜 呢 ？ 有 什 么 比 狮 子 还 强 呢 ？ 参 孙 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 若 非 用 我 的 母 牛 犊 耕 地 ， 就 猜 不 出 我 谜 语 的 意 思 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then on the seventh day, before he went into the bride's room, the men of the town said to him, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said to them, If you had not been ploughing with my cow you would not have got the answer to my question. 
<br>14:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 和 华 的 灵 大 大 感 动 参 孙 ， 他 就 下 到 亚 实 基 伦 ， 击 杀 了 三 十 个 人 ， 夺 了 他 们 的 衣 裳 ， 将 衣 裳 给 了 猜 出 谜 语 的 人 。 参 孙 发 怒 ， 就 上 父 家 去 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the spirit of the Lord came rushing on him, and he went down to Ashkelon and, attacking thirty men there, took their clothing from them, and gave it to the men who had given the answer to his hard question. Then, full of wrath, he went back to his father's house. 
<br>14:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 参 孙 的 妻 便 归 了 参 孙 的 陪 伴 ， 就 是 作 过 他 朋 友 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But Samson's wife was given to the friend who had been his best man.
