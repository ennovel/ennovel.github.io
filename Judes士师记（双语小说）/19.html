<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now in those days, when there was no king in Israel, a certain Levite was living in the inmost parts of the hill-country of Ephraim, and he got for himself a servant-wife from Beth-lehem-judah. 
<br>19:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 妾 行 淫 离 开 丈 夫 ， 回 犹 大 伯 利 恒 ， 到 了 父 家 ， 在 那 里 住 了 四 个 月 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole months. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And his servant-wife was angry with him, and went away from him to her father's house at Beth-lehem-judah, and was there for four months. 
<br>19:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 她 丈 夫 起 来 ， 带 着 一 个 仆 人 ， 两 匹 驴 去 见 她 ， 用 好 话 劝 她 回 来 。 女 子 就 引 丈 夫 进 入 父 家 。 她 父 见 了 那 人 ， 便 欢 欢 喜 喜 地 迎 接 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then her husband got up and went after her, with the purpose of talking kindly to her, and taking her back with him; he had with him his young man and two asses: and she took him into her father's house, and her father, when he saw him, came forward to him with joy. 
<br>19:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 人 的 岳 父 ， 就 是 女 子 的 父 亲 ， 将 那 人 留 下 住 了 三 天 。 于 是 二 人 一 同 吃 喝 ， 住 宿 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And his father-in-law, the girl's father, kept him there for three days; and they had food and drink and took their rest there. 
<br>19:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 到 第 四 天 ， 利 未 人 清 早 起 来 要 走 ， 女 子 的 父 亲 对 女 婿 说 ， 请 你 吃 点 饭 ， 加 添 心 力 ， 然 后 可 以 行 路 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now on the fourth day they got up early in the morning and he made ready to go away; but the girl's father said to his son-in-law, Take a little food to keep up your strength, and then go on your way. 
<br>19:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 二 人 坐 下 一 同 吃 喝 。 女 子 的 父 亲 对 那 人 说 ， 请 你 再 住 一 夜 ， 畅 快 你 的 心 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So seating themselves they had food and drink, the two of them together; and the girl's father said to the man, If it is your pleasure, take your rest here tonight, and let your heart be glad. 
<br>19:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 人 起 来 要 走 ， 他 岳 父 强 留 他 ， 他 又 住 了 一 宿 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the man got up to go away, but his father-in-law would not let him go, so he took his rest there again for the night. 
<br>19:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 到 第 五 天 ， 他 清 早 起 来 要 走 ， 女 子 的 父 亲 说 ， 请 你 吃 点 饭 ， 加 添 心 力 ， 等 到 日 头 偏 西 再 走 。 于 是 二 人 一 同 吃 饭 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then early on the morning of the fifth day he got up to go away; but the girl's father said, Keep up your strength; so the two of them had a meal, and the man and his woman and his servant did not go till after the middle of the day. 
<br>19:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 人 同 他 的 妾 和 仆 人 起 来 要 走 ， 他 岳 父 ， 就 是 女 子 的 父 亲 ， 对 他 说 ， 看 哪 ， 日 头 偏 西 了 ， 请 你 再 住 一 夜 。 天 快 晚 了 ， 可 以 在 这 里 住 宿 ， 畅 快 你 的 心 。 明 天 早 早 起 行 回 家 去 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when they got up to go away, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said to him, Now evening is coming on, so do not go tonight; see, the day is almost gone; take your rest here and let your heart be glad, and tomorrow early, go on your way back to your house. 
<br>19:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 人 不 愿 再 住 一 夜 ， 就 备 上 那 两 匹 驴 ， 带 着 妾 起 身 走 了 ， 来 到 耶 布 斯 的 对 面 ， 耶 布 斯 就 是 耶 路 撒 冷 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But the man would not be kept there that night, and he got up and went away and came opposite to Jebus (which is Jerusalem); and he had with him the two asses, ready for travelling, and his woman. 
<br>19:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 临 近 耶 布 斯 的 时 候 ， 日 头 快 要 落 了 ， 仆 人 对 主 人 说 ， 我 们 不 如 进 这 耶 布 斯 人 的 城 里 住 宿 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; When they got near Jebus the day was far gone; and the servant said to his master, Now let us go from our road into this town of the Jebusites and take our night's rest there. 
<br>19:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 主 人 回 答 说 ， 我 们 不 可 进 不 是 以 色 列 人 住 的 外 邦 城 ， 不 如 过 到 基 比 亚 去 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But his master said to him, We will not go out of our way into a strange town, whose people are not of the children of Israel; but we will go on to Gibeah. 
<br>19:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 又 对 仆 人 说 ， 我 们 可 以 到 一 个 地 方 ， 或 住 在 基 比 亚 ， 或 住 在 拉 玛 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said to his servant, Come, let us go on to one of these places, stopping for the night in Gibeah or Ramah. 
<br>19:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 就 往 前 走 。 将 到 便 雅 悯 的 基 比 亚 ， 日 头 已 经 落 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So they went on their way; and the sun went down when they were near Gibeah in the land of Benjamin. 
<br>19:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 进 入 基 比 亚 要 在 那 里 住 宿 ， 就 坐 在 城 里 的 街 上 ， 因 为 无 人 接 他 们 进 家 住 宿 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And they went off the road there with the purpose of stopping for the night in Gibeah: and he went in, seating himself in the street of the town, for no one took them into his house for the night. 
<br>19:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 晚 上 ， 有 一 个 老 年 人 从 田 间 作 工 回 来 。 他 原 是 以 法 莲 山 地 的 人 ， 住 在 基 比 亚 。 那 地 方 的 人 却 是 便 雅 悯 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now when it was evening they saw an old man coming back from his work in the fields; he was from the hill-country of Ephraim and was living in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites. 
<br>19:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 老 年 人 举 目 看 见 客 人 坐 在 城 里 的 街 上 ， 就 问 他 说 ， 你 从 哪 里 来 。 要 往 哪 里 去 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when he saw the traveller in the street of the town, the old man said, Where are you going? and where do you come from? 
<br>19:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 回 答 说 ， 我 们 从 犹 大 伯 利 恒 来 ， 要 往 以 法 莲 山 地 那 边 去 。 我 原 是 那 里 的 人 ， 到 过 犹 大 伯 利 恒 ， 现 在 我 往 耶 和 华 的 殿 去 ， 在 这 里 无 人 接 我 进 他 的 家 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that receiveth me to house. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said to him, We are on our way from Beth-lehem-judah to the inmost parts of the hill-country of Ephraim: I came from there and went to Beth-lehem-judah: now I am on my way back to my house, but no man will take me into his house. 
<br>19:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 其 实 我 有 粮 草 可 以 喂 驴 ， 我 与 我 的 妾 ， 并 我 的 仆 人 ， 有 饼 有 酒 ， 并 不 缺 少 什 么 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But we have dry grass and food for our asses, as well as bread and wine for me, and for the woman, and for the young man with us: we have no need of anything. 
<br>19:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 老 年 人 说 ， 愿 你 平 安 。 你 所 需 用 的 我 都 给 你 ， 只 是 不 可 在 街 上 过 夜 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the old man said, Peace be with you; let all your needs be my care; only do not take your rest in the street. 
<br>19:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 领 他 们 到 家 里 ， 喂 上 驴 ， 他 们 就 洗 脚 吃 喝 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So he took them into his house and gave the asses food; and after washing their feet they took food and drink. 
<br>19:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 心 里 正 欢 畅 的 时 候 ， 城 中 的 匪 徒 围 住 房 子 ， 连 连 叩 门 ， 对 房 主 老 人 说 ， 你 把 那 进 你 家 的 人 带 出 来 ， 我 们 要 与 他 交 合 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; While they were taking their pleasure at the meal, the good-for-nothing men of the town came round the house, giving blows on the door; and they said to the old man, the master of the house, Send out that man who came to your house, so that we may take our pleasure with him. 
<br>19:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 房 主 出 来 对 他 们 说 ， 弟 兄 们 哪 ， 不 要 这 样 作 恶 。 这 人 既 然 进 了 我 的 家 ， 你 们 就 不 要 行 这 丑 事 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So the man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said, No, my brothers, do not this evil thing; this man has come into my house, and you are not to do him this wrong. 
<br>19:24 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 有 个 女 儿 ， 还 是 处 女 ， 并 有 这 人 的 妾 ， 我 将 她 们 领 出 来 任 凭 你 们 玷 辱 她 们 ， 只 是 向 这 人 不 可 行 这 样 的 丑 事 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; See, here is my daughter, a virgin, and his servant-wife: I will send them out for you to take them and do with them whatever you will. But do no such thing of shame to this man. 
<br>19:25 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 些 人 却 不 听 从 他 的 话 。 那 人 就 把 他 的 妾 拉 出 去 交 给 他 们 ， 他 们 便 与 她 交 合 ， 终 夜 凌 辱 她 ， 直 到 天 色 快 亮 才 放 她 去 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But the men would not give ear to him: so the man took his woman and sent her out to them; and they took her by force, using her for their pleasure all night till the morning; and when dawn came they let her go. 
<br>19:26 [hgb]&nbsp; 天 快 亮 的 时 候 ， 妇 人 回 到 她 主 人 住 宿 的 房 门 前 ， 就 仆 倒 在 地 ， 直 到 天 亮 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then at the dawn of day the woman came, and, falling down at the door of the man's house where her master was, was stretched there till it was light. 
<br>19:27 [hgb]&nbsp; 早 晨 ， 她 的 主 人 起 来 开 了 房 门 ， 出 去 要 行 路 ， 不 料 那 妇 人 仆 倒 在 房 门 前 ， 两 手 搭 在 门 槛 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the threshold. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; In the morning her master got up, and opening the door of the house went out to go on his way; and he saw his servant-wife stretched on the earth at the door of the house with her hands on the step. 
<br>19:28 [hgb]&nbsp; 就 对 妇 人 说 ， 起 来 ， 我 们 走 吧 。 妇 人 却 不 回 答 。 那 人 便 将 她 驮 在 驴 上 ， 起 身 回 本 处 去 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said to her, Get up and let us be going; but there was no answer; so he took her up and put her on the ass, and went on his way and came to his house. 
<br>19:29 [hgb]&nbsp; 到 了 家 里 ， 用 刀 将 妾 的 尸 身 切 成 十 二 块 ， 使 人 拿 着 传 送 以 色 列 的 四 境 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when he had come to his house, he got his knife, and took the woman, cutting her up bone by bone into twelve parts, which he sent through all Israel. 
<br>19:30 [hgb]&nbsp; 凡 看 见 的 人 都 说 ， 从 以 色 列 人 出 埃 及 地 ， 直 到 今 日 ， 这 样 的 事 没 有 行 过 ， 也 没 有 见 过 。 现 在 应 当 思 想 ， 大 家 商 议 当 怎 样 办 理 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your minds. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he gave orders to the men whom he sent, saying, This is what you are to say to all the men of Israel, Has ever an act like this been done from the day when the children of Israel came out of Egypt to this day? Give thought to it, turning it over in your minds, and give your opinion of it.
