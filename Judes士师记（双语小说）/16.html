<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now Samson went to Gaza, and there he saw a loose woman and went in to her. 
<br>16:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 有 人 告 诉 迦 萨 人 说 ， 参 孙 到 这 里 来 了 。 他 们 就 把 他 团 团 围 住 ， 终 夜 在 城 门 悄 悄 埋 伏 ， 说 ， 等 到 天 亮 我 们 便 杀 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And it was said to the Gazites, Samson is here. So they went round, watching for him all day at the doorway of the town, but at night they kept quiet, saying, When daylight comes we will put him to death. 
<br>16:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 参 孙 睡 到 半 夜 ， 起 来 ， 将 城 门 的 门 扇 ， 门 框 ， 门 闩 ， 一 齐 拆 下 来 ， 扛 在 肩 上 ， 扛 到 希 伯 仑 前 的 山 顶 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Samson was there till the middle of the night; then he got up, and took a grip on the doors of the town, pulling them up, together with their two supports and their locks, and put them on his back and took them up to the top of the hill in front of Hebron. 
<br>16:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 后 来 参 孙 在 梭 烈 谷 喜 爱 一 个 妇 人 ， 名 叫 大 利 拉 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now after this, he was in love with a woman in the valley of Sorek, named Delilah. 
<br>16:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 非 利 士 人 的 首 领 上 去 见 那 妇 人 ， 对 她 说 ， 求 你 诓 哄 参 孙 ， 探 探 他 因 何 有 这 么 大 的 力 气 ， 我 们 用 何 法 能 胜 他 ， 捆 绑 克 制 他 。 我 们 就 每 人 给 你 一 千 一 百 舍 客 勒 银 子 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the chiefs of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her, Make use of your power over him and see what is the secret of his great strength, and how we may get the better of him, and put bands on him, so that we may make him feeble; and every one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels of silver. 
<br>16:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 利 拉 对 参 孙 说 ， 求 你 告 诉 我 ， 你 因 何 有 这 么 大 的 力 气 ， 当 用 何 法 捆 绑 克 制 你 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So Delilah said to Samson, Make clear to me now what is the secret of your great strength, and how you may be put in bands and made feeble. 
<br>16:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 参 孙 回 答 说 ， 人 若 用 七 条 未 干 的 青 绳 子 捆 绑 我 ， 我 就 软 弱 像 别 人 一 样 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Samson said to her, If seven new bow-cords which have never been made dry are knotted round me, I will become feeble and will be like any other man. 
<br>16:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 非 利 士 人 的 首 领 拿 了 七 条 未 干 的 青 绳 子 来 ， 交 给 妇 人 ， 她 就 用 绳 子 捆 绑 参 孙 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So the chiefs of the Philistines gave her seven new bow-cords which had never been made dry, and she had them tightly knotted round him. 
<br>16:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 有 人 预 先 埋 伏 在 妇 人 的 内 室 里 。 妇 人 说 ， 参 孙 哪 。 非 利 士 人 拿 你 来 了 。 参 孙 就 挣 断 绳 子 ， 如 挣 断 经 火 的 麻 线 一 般 。 这 样 ， 他 力 气 的 根 由 人 还 是 不 知 道 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now she had men waiting secretly in the inner room; and she said to him, The Philistines are on you, Samson. And the cords were broken by him as a twist of thread is broken when touched by a flame. So the secret of his strength did not come to light. 
<br>16:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 利 拉 对 参 孙 说 ， 你 欺 哄 我 ， 向 我 说 谎 言 。 现 在 求 你 告 诉 我 当 用 何 法 捆 绑 你 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Delilah said to Samson, See, you have been making sport of me with false words; now, say truly how may you be put in bands? 
<br>16:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 参 孙 回 答 说 ， 人 若 用 没 有 使 过 的 新 绳 捆 绑 我 ， 我 就 软 弱 像 别 人 一 样 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said to her, If they only put round me new thick cords which have never been used, then I will become feeble and will be like any other man. 
<br>16:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 利 拉 就 用 新 绳 捆 绑 他 。 对 他 说 ， 参 孙 哪 。 非 利 士 人 拿 你 来 了 。 有 人 预 先 埋 伏 在 内 室 里 。 参 孙 将 臂 上 的 绳 挣 断 了 ， 如 挣 断 一 条 线 一 样 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So Delilah took new thick cords, knotting them tightly round him, and said to him, The Philistines are on you, Samson. And men were waiting secretly in the inner room. And the cords were broken off his arms like threads. 
<br>16:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 利 拉 对 参 孙 说 ， 你 到 如 今 还 是 欺 哄 我 ， 向 我 说 谎 言 。 求 你 告 诉 我 ， 当 用 何 法 捆 绑 你 。 参 孙 回 答 说 ， 你 若 将 我 头 上 的 七 条 发 绺 ， 与 纬 线 同 织 就 可 以 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Delilah said to Samson, Up to now you have made sport of me with false words; now say truly, how may you be put in bands? And he said to her, If you get the seven twists of my hair worked into the cloth you are making and fixed with the pin, I will become feeble and will be like any other man. 
<br>16:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 大 利 拉 将 他 的 发 绺 与 纬 线 同 织 ， 用 橛 子 钉 住 ， 对 他 说 ， 参 孙 哪 。 非 利 士 人 拿 你 来 了 。 参 孙 从 睡 中 醒 来 ， 将 机 上 的 橛 子 和 纬 线 一 齐 都 拔 出 来 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So while he was sleeping she got the seven twists of his hair worked into her cloth and fixed with the pin, and said to him, The Philistines are on you, Samson. Then awaking from his sleep, he got up quickly, pulling up cloth and machine together. 
<br>16:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 利 拉 对 参 孙 说 ， 你 既 不 与 我 同 心 ， 怎 么 说 你 爱 我 呢 ？ 你 这 三 次 欺 哄 我 ， 没 有 告 诉 我 ， 你 因 何 有 这 么 大 的 力 气 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And she said to him, Why do you say you are my lover when your heart is not mine? Three times you have made sport of me, and have not made clear to me the secret of your great strength. 
<br>16:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 利 拉 天 天 用 话 催 逼 他 ， 甚 至 他 心 里 烦 闷 要 死 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So day after day she gave him no peace, for ever questioning him till his soul was troubled to death. 
<br>16:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 参 孙 就 把 心 中 所 藏 的 都 告 诉 了 她 ， 对 她 说 ， 向 来 人 没 有 用 剃 头 刀 剃 我 的 头 ， 因 为 我 自 出 母 胎 就 归 神 作 拿 细 耳 人 。 若 剃 了 我 的 头 发 ， 我 的 力 气 就 离 开 我 ， 我 便 软 弱 像 别 人 一 样 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And opening all his heart to her, he said to her, My head has never been touched by a blade, for I have been separate to God from the day of my birth: if my hair is cut off, then my strength will go from me and I will become feeble, and will be like any other man. 
<br>16:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 利 拉 见 他 把 心 中 所 藏 的 都 告 诉 了 她 ， 就 打 发 人 到 非 利 士 人 的 首 领 那 里 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 他 已 经 把 心 中 所 藏 的 都 告 诉 了 我 ， 请 你 们 再 上 来 一 次 。 于 是 非 利 士 人 的 首 领 手 里 拿 着 银 子 ， 上 到 妇 人 那 里 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when Delilah saw that he had let her see into his heart, she sent word to the chiefs of the Philistines saying, Come up this time, for he has let out all his heart to me. Then the chiefs of the Philistines came to her, with the money in their hands. 
<br>16:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 利 拉 使 参 孙 枕 着 她 的 膝 睡 觉 ， 叫 了 一 个 人 来 剃 除 他 头 上 的 七 条 发 绺 。 于 是 大 利 拉 克 制 他 ， 他 的 力 气 就 离 开 他 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And she made him go to sleep on her knees; and she sent for a man and had his seven twists of hair cut off; and while it was being done he became feeble and his strength went from him. 
<br>16:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 利 拉 说 ， 参 孙 哪 。 非 利 士 人 拿 你 来 了 。 参 孙 从 睡 中 醒 来 ， 心 里 说 ， 我 要 像 前 几 次 出 去 活 动 身 体 。 他 却 不 知 道 耶 和 华 已 经 离 开 他 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then she said, The Philistines are on you, Samson. And awaking from his sleep, he said, I will go out as at other times, shaking myself free. But he was not conscious that the Lord had gone from him. 
<br>16:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 非 利 士 人 将 他 拿 住 ， 剜 了 他 的 眼 睛 ， 带 他 下 到 迦 萨 ， 用 铜 链 拘 索 他 。 他 就 在 监 里 推 磨 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So the Philistines took him and put out his eyes; then they took him down to Gaza, and, chaining him with bands of brass, put him to work crushing grain in the prison-house. 
<br>16:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 然 而 他 的 头 发 被 剃 之 后 ， 又 渐 渐 长 起 来 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But the growth of his hair was starting again after it had been cut off. 
<br>16:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 非 利 士 人 的 首 领 聚 集 ， 要 给 他 们 的 神 大 衮 献 大 祭 ， 并 且 欢 乐 ， 因 为 他 们 说 ， 我 们 的 神 将 我 们 的 仇 敌 参 孙 交 在 我 们 手 中 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the chiefs of the Philistines came together to make a great offering to Dagon their god, and to be glad; for they said, Our god has given into our hands Samson our hater. 
<br>16:24 [hgb]&nbsp; 众 人 看 见 参 孙 ， 就 赞 美 他 们 的 神 说 ， 我 们 的 神 将 毁 坏 我 们 地 ， 杀 害 我 们 许 多 人 的 仇 敌 交 在 我 们 手 中 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when the people saw him, they gave praise to their god; for they said, Our god has given into our hands the one who was fighting against us, who made our country waste, and who put great numbers of us to death. 
<br>16:25 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 正 宴 乐 的 时 候 ， 就 说 ， 叫 参 孙 来 ， 在 我 们 面 前 戏 耍 戏 耍 。 于 是 将 参 孙 从 监 里 提 出 来 ， 他 就 在 众 人 面 前 戏 耍 。 他 们 使 他 站 在 两 柱 中 间 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now when their hearts were full of joy, they said, Send for Samson to make sport for us. And they sent for Samson out of the prison-house, and he made sport before them; and they put him between the pillars. 
<br>16:26 [hgb]&nbsp; 参 孙 向 拉 他 手 的 童 子 说 ， 求 你 让 我 摸 着 托 房 的 柱 子 ， 我 要 靠 一 靠 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Samson said to the boy who took him by the hand, Let me put my hand on the pillars supporting the house, so that I may put my back against them. 
<br>16:27 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 时 房 内 充 满 男 女 ， 非 利 士 人 的 众 首 领 也 都 在 那 里 。 房 的 平 顶 上 约 有 三 千 男 女 ， 观 看 参 孙 戏 耍 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and about three thousand men and women were on the roof, looking on while Samson made sport. 
<br>16:28 [hgb]&nbsp; 参 孙 求 告 耶 和 华 说 ， 主 耶 和 华 阿 ， 求 你 眷 念 我 。 神 阿 ， 求 你 赐 我 这 一 次 的 力 量 ， 使 我 在 非 利 士 人 身 上 报 那 剜 我 双 眼 的 仇 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Samson, crying out to the Lord, said, O Lord God, do have me now in mind, and do make me strong only this once, O God, so that I may take one last payment from the Philistines for my two eyes. 
<br>16:29 [hgb]&nbsp; 参 孙 就 抱 住 托 房 的 那 两 根 柱 子 ， 左 手 抱 一 根 ， 右 手 抱 一 根 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Samson put his arms round the two middle pillars supporting the house, putting his weight on them, on one with his right hand and on the other with his left. 
<br>16:30 [hgb]&nbsp; 说 ， 我 情 愿 与 非 利 士 人 同 死 。 就 尽 力 屈 身 ， 房 子 倒 塌 ， 压 住 首 领 和 房 内 的 众 人 。 这 样 ， 参 孙 死 时 所 杀 的 人 ， 比 活 着 所 杀 的 还 多 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Samson said, Let death overtake me with the Philistines. And he put out all his strength, and the house came down on the chiefs and on all the people who were in it. So the dead whom he sent to destruction by his death were more than all those on whom he had sent destruction in his life. 
<br>16:31 [hgb]&nbsp; 参 孙 的 弟 兄 和 他 父 的 全 家 ， 都 下 去 取 他 的 尸 首 ， 抬 上 来 葬 在 琐 拉 和 以 实 陶 中 间 ， 在 他 父 玛 挪 亚 的 坟 墓 里 。 参 孙 作 以 色 列 的 士 师 二 十 年 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then his brothers and his father's people came down and took him up and put his body to rest in the earth between Zorah and Eshtaol in the resting-place of Manoah his father. And he had been judge of Israel for twenty years.
