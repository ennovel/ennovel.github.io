It is hard to say why — for they model their exteriors whimsically on Wall Street brokers, cattle kings or English explorers — but they all turn out looking like writers, as definitely typed as ‘The Public’ or ‘The Profiteers’ in the cartoons.
<br> 
<br> Pat Hobby was the exception. He did not look like a writer. And only in one corner of the Republic could he have been identified as a member of the entertainment world. Even there the first guess would have been that he was an extra down on his luck, or a bit player who specialized in the sort of father who should never come home. But a writer he was: he had collaborated in over two dozen moving picture scripts, most of them, it must be admitted, prior to 1929.
<br> 
<br> A writer? He had a desk in the Writers’ Building at the studio; he had pencils, paper, a secretary, paper clips, a pad for office memoranda. And he sat in an overstuffed chair, his eyes not so very bloodshot taking in the morning’s Reporter.
<br> 
<br> ‘I got to get to work,’ he told Miss Raudenbush at eleven. And again at twelve:
<br> 
<br> ‘I got to get to work.’
<br> 
<br> At quarter to one, he began to feel hungry — up to this point every move, or rather every moment, was in the writer’s tradition. Even to the faint irritation that no one had annoyed him, no one had bothered him, no one had interfered with the long empty dream which constituted his average day.
<br> 
<br> He was about to accuse his secretary of staring at him when the welcome interruption came. A studio guide tapped at his door and brought him a note from his boss, Jack Berners:
<br> 
<br> Dear Pat:
<br> 
<br> Please take some time off and show these people around the lot.
<br> 
<br> Jack
<br> 
<br> ‘My God!’ Pat exclaimed. ‘How can I be expected to get anything done and show people around the lot at the same time. Who are they?’ he demanded of the guide.
<br> 
<br> ‘I don’t know. One of them seems to be kind of coloured. He looks like the extras they had at Paramount for Bengal Lancer. He can’t speak English. The other —’
<br> 
<br> Pat was putting on his coat to see for himself.
<br> 
<br> ‘Will you be wanting me this afternoon?’ asked Miss Raudenbush.
<br> 
<br> He looked at her with infinite reproach and went out in front of the Writers’ Building.
<br> 
<br> The visitors were there. The sultry person was tall and of a fine carriage, dressed in excellent English clothes except for a turban. The other was a youth of fifteen, quite light of hue. He also wore a turban with beautifully cut jodhpurs and riding coat.
<br> 
<br> They bowed formally.
<br> 
<br> ‘Hear you want to go on some sets,’ said Pat, ‘You friends of Jack Berners?’
<br> 
<br> ‘Acquaintances,’ said the youth. ‘May I present you to my uncle: Sir Singrim Dak Raj.’
<br> 
<br> Probably, thought Pat, the company was cooking up a Bengal Lancers, and this man would play the heavy who owned the Khyber Pass. Maybe they’d put Pat on it — at three-fifty a week. Why not? He knew how to write that stuff:
<br> 
<br> Beautiful Long Shot. The Gorge. Show Tribesman firing from behind rocks.
<br> 
<br> Medium Shot. Tribesman hit by bullet making nose dive over high rock. (use stunt man)
<br> 
<br> Medium Long Shot. The Valley. British troops wheeling out cannon.
<br> 
<br> ‘You going to be long in Hollywood?’ he asked shrewdly.
<br> 
<br> ‘My uncle doesn’t speak English,’ said the youth in a measured voice. ‘We are here only a few days. You see — I am your putative son.’
