People still cared about art and tried to make it out of everything from old clothes to orange peel and that was how the Princess Dignanni found Pat. She wanted to make art out of him.
<br> 
<br> ‘No, not you, Mr DeTinc.’ she said, ‘I can’t paint you. You are a very standardized product, Mr DeTinc.’
<br> 
<br> Mr DeTinc, who was a power in pictures and had even been photographed with Mr Duchman, the Secret Sin specialist, stepped smoothly out of the way. He was not offended — in his whole life Mr DeTinc had never been offended — but especially not now, for the Princess did not want to paint Clark Gable or Spencer Rooney or Vivien Leigh either.
<br> 
<br> She saw Pat in the commissary and found he was a writer, and asked that he be invited to Mr DeTinc’s party. The Princess was a pretty woman born in Boston, Massachusetts and Pat was forty-nine with red-rimmed eyes and a soft purr of whiskey on his breath.
<br> 
<br> ‘You write scenarios, Mr Hobby?’
<br> 
<br> ‘I help,’ said Pat. ‘Takes more than one person to prepare a script.’
<br> 
<br> He was flattered by this attention and not a little suspicious. It was only because his supervisor was a nervous wreck that he happened to have a job at all. His supervisor had forgotten a week ago that he had hired Pat, and when Pat was spotted in the commissary and told he was wanted at Mr DeTinc’s house, the writer had passed a mauvais quart d’heure. It did not even look like the kind of party that Pat had known in his prosperous days. There was not so much as a drunk passed out in the downstairs toilet.
<br> 
<br> ‘I imagine scenario writing is very well-paid,’ said the Princess.
<br> 
<br> Pat glanced around to see who was within hearing. Mr DeTinc had withdrawn his huge bulk somewhat, but one of his apparently independent eyes seemed fixed glittering on Pat.
<br> 
<br> ‘Very well paid,’ said Pat — and he added in a lower voice, ‘— if you can get it.’
<br> 
<br> The Princess seemed to understand and lowered her voice too.
<br> 
<br> ‘You mean writers have trouble getting work?’
<br> 
<br> He nodded.
<br> 
<br> ‘Too many of ’em get in these unions.’ He raised his voice a little for Mr DeTinc’s benefit. ‘They’re all Reds, most of these writers.’
<br> 
<br> The Princess nodded.
<br> 
<br> ‘Will you turn your face a little to the light?’ she said politely. ‘There, that’s fine. You won’t mind coming to my studio tomorrow, will you? Just to pose for me an hour?’
<br> 
<br> He scrutinized her again.
<br> 
<br> ‘Naked?’ he asked cautiously.
<br> 
<br> ‘Oh, no,’ she averred. ‘Just the head.’
<br> 
<br> Mr DeTinc moved nearer and nodded.
<br> 
<br> ‘You ought to go. Princess Dignanni is going to paint some of the biggest stars here. Going to paint Jack Benny and Baby Sandy and Hedy Lamarr — isn’t that a fact, Princess?’
<br> 
<br> The artist didn’t answer. She was a pretty good portrait painter and she knew just how good she was and just how much of it was her title. She was hesitating between her several manners — Picasso’s rose period with a flash of Boldini, or straight Reginald Marsh. But she knew what she was going to call it. She was going to call it Hollywood and Vine.
