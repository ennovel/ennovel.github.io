It had followed Pat in his headlong, hatless flight across the city. His destination, his refuge, was the studio, where he was not employed but which had been home to him for twenty years.
<br> 
<br> Was it his imagination or did the policeman at the gate give him and his pass an especially long look? It might be the lack of a hat — Hollywood was full of hatless men but Pat felt marked, especially as there had been no opportunity to part his thin grey hair.
<br> 
<br> In the Writers’ Building he went into the lavatory. Then he remembered: by some inspired ukase from above, all mirrors had been removed from the Writers’ Building a year ago.
<br> 
<br> Across the hall he saw Bee McIlvaine’s door ajar, and discerned her plump person.
<br> 
<br> ‘Bee, can you loan me your compact box?’ he asked.
<br> 
<br> Bee looked at him suspiciously, then frowned and dug it from her purse.
<br> 
<br> ‘You on the lot?’ she inquired.
<br> 
<br> ‘Will be next week,’ he prophesied. He put the compact on her desk and bent over it with his comb. ‘Why won’t they put mirrors back in the johnnies? Do they think writers would look at themselves all day?’
<br> 
<br> ‘Remember when they took out the couches?’ said Bee. ‘In nineteen thirty-two. And they put them back in thirty-four.’
<br> 
<br> ‘I worked at home,’ said Pat feelingly.
<br> 
<br> Finished with her mirror he wondered if she were good for a loan — enough to buy a hat and something to eat. Bee must have seen the look in his eyes for she forestalled him.
<br> 
<br> ‘The Finns got all my money,’ she said, ‘and I’m worried about my job. Either my picture starts tomorrow or it’s going to be shelved. We haven’t even got a title.’
<br> 
<br> She handed him a mimeographed bulletin from the scenario department and Pat glanced at the headline.
<br> 
<br> TO ALL DEPARTMENTS
<br> 
<br> TITLE WANTED— FIFTY DOLLARS REWARD
<br> 
<br> SUMMARY FOLLOWS
<br> 
<br> ‘I could use fifty,’ Pat said. ‘What’s it about?’
<br> 
<br> ‘It’s written there. It’s about a lot of stuff that goes on in tourist cabins.’
<br> 
<br> Pat started and looked at her wild-eyed. He had thought to be safe here behind the guarded gates but news travelled fast. This was a friendly or perhaps not so friendly warning. He must move on. He was a hunted man now, with nowhere to lay his hatless head.
<br> 
<br> ‘I don’t know anything about that,’ he mumbled and walked hastily from the room.
