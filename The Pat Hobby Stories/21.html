His speeches were simplicity itself — Pat had written their like many times. ‘Don’t finish him till the Brain comes’; ‘Let’s get out of here’; ‘Fella, you’re going out feet first.’ Pat found it pleasant — mostly waiting around as in all picture work — and he hoped it might lead to other openings in this line. He was sorry that the job was so short.
<br> 
<br> His last scene was on location. He knew ‘The Rat’ was to touch off an explosion in which he himself was killed but Pat had watched such scenes and was certain he would be in no slightest danger. Out on the back lot he was mildly curious when they measured him around the waist and chest.
<br> 
<br> ‘Making a dummy?’ he asked.
<br> 
<br> ‘Not exactly,’ the prop man said. ‘This thing is all made but it was for Gyp McCarthy and I want to see if it’ll fit you.’
<br> 
<br> ‘Does it?’
<br> 
<br> ‘Just exactly.’
<br> 
<br> ‘What is it?’
<br> 
<br> ‘Well — it’s a sort of protector.’
<br> 
<br> A slight draught of uneasiness blew in Pat’s mind.
<br> 
<br> ‘Protector for what? Against the explosion?’
<br> 
<br> ‘Heck no! The explosion is phony — just a process shot. This is something else.’
<br> 
<br> ‘What is it?’ persisted Pat. ‘If I got to be protected against something I got a right to know what it is.’
<br> 
<br> Near the false front of a warehouse a battery of cameras were getting into position. George Hilliard came suddenly out of a group and toward Pat and putting his arm on his shoulder steered him toward the actors’ dressing tent. Once inside he handed Pat a flask.
<br> 
<br> ‘Have a drink, old man.’
<br> 
<br> Pat took a long pull.
<br> 
<br> ‘There’s a bit of business, Pat,’ Hilliard said, ‘needs some new costuming. I’ll explain it while they dress you.’
<br> 
<br> Pat was divested of coat and vest, his trousers were loosened and in an instant a hinged iron doublet was fastened about his middle, extending from his armpits to his crotch very much like a plaster cast.
<br> 
<br> ‘This is the very finest strongest iron, Pat,’ Hilliard assured him. ‘The very best in tensile strength and resistance. It was built in Pittsburgh.’
<br> 
<br> Pat suddenly resisted the attempts of two dressers to pull his trousers up over the thing and to slip on his coat and vest.
<br> 
<br> ‘What’s it for?’ he demanded, arms flailing. ‘I want to know. You’re not going to shoot at me if that’s what —’
<br> 
<br> ‘No shooting.’
<br> 
<br> ‘Then what is it? I’m no stunt man —’
<br> 
<br> ‘You signed a contract just like McCarthy’s to do anything within reason — and our lawyers have certified this.’
<br> 
<br> ‘What is it?’ Pat’s mouth was dry.
<br> 
<br> ‘It’s an automobile.’
<br> 
<br> ‘You’re going to hit me with an automobile.’
<br> 
<br> ‘Give me a chance to tell you,’ begged Hilliard. ‘Nobody’s going to hit you. The auto’s going to pass over you, that’s all. This case is so strong —’
<br> 
<br> ‘Oh no!’ said Pat. ‘Oh no!’ He tore at the iron corselet. ‘Not on your —’
<br> 
<br> George Hilliard pinioned his arms firmly.
<br> 
<br> ‘Pat, you almost wrecked this picture once — you’re not going to do it again. Be a man.’
<br> 
<br> ‘That’s what I’m going to be. You’re not going to squash me out flat like that extra last month.’
<br> 
<br> He broke off. Behind Hilliard he saw a face he knew — a hateful and dreaded face — that of the collector for the North Hollywood Finance and Loan Company. Over in the parking lot stood his coupe, faithful pal and servant since 1934, companion of his misfortunes, his only certain home.
<br> 
<br> ‘Either you fill your contract,’ said George Hilliard, ‘— or you’re out of pictures for keeps.’
<br> 
<br> The man from the finance company had taken a step forward. Pat turned to Hilliard.
<br> 
<br> ‘Will you loan me —’ he faltered, ‘— will you advance me twenty-five dollars?’
<br> 
<br> ‘Sure,’ said Hilliard.
<br> 
<br> Pat spoke fiercely to the credit man:
<br> 
<br> ‘You hear that? You’ll get your money, but if this thing breaks, my death’ll be on your head.’
<br> 
<br> The next few minutes passed in a dream. He heard Hilliard’s last instructions as they walked from the tent. Pat was to be lying in a shallow ditch to touch off the dynamite — and then the hero would drive the car slowly across his middle. Pat listened dimly. A picture of himself, cracked like an egg by the factory wall, lay a-thwart his mind.
<br> 
<br> He picked up the torch and lay down in the ditch. Afar off he heard the call ‘Quiet’, then Hilliard’s voice and the noise of the car warming up.
<br> 
<br> ‘Action!’ called someone. There was the sound of the car growing nearer — louder. And then Pat Hobby knew no more.
