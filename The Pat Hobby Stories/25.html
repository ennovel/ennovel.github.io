<br> 
<br> ‘We’ve got to get a title,’ said Bee gloomily.
<br> 
<br> She handed Pat the mimeograph offering fifty dollars reward and put a pencil in his hand. Pat stared at the paper unseeingly.
<br> 
<br> ‘How about it?’ she asked. ‘Who’s got a title?’
<br> 
<br> There was a long silence.
<br> 
<br> ‘Test Pilot’s been used, hasn’t it?’ he said with a vague tone.
<br> 
<br> ‘Wake up! This isn’t about aviation.’
<br> 
<br> ‘Well, I was just thinking it was a good title.’
<br> 
<br> ‘So’s The Birth of a Nation.’
<br> 
<br> ‘But not for this picture,’ Pat muttered. ‘Birth of a Nation wouldn’t suit this picture.’
<br> 
<br> ‘But not for this picture,’ Pat muttered. ‘Birth of a Nation wouldn’t suit this picture.’
<br> 
<br> ‘Are you ribbing me?’ demanded Bee. ‘Or are you losing your mind? This is serious.’
<br> 
<br> ‘Sure — I know.’ Feebly he scrawled words at the bottom of the page. ‘I’ve had a couple of drinks that’s all. My head’ll clear up in a minute. I’m trying to think what have been the most successful titles. The trouble is they’ve all been used, like It Happened One Night.’
<br> 
<br> Bee looked at him uneasily. He was having trouble keeping his eyes open and she did not want him to pass out in her office. After a minute she called Jack Berners.
<br> 
<br> ‘Could you possibly come up? I’ve got some title ideas.’
<br> 
<br> Jack arrived with a sheaf of suggestions sent in from here and there in the studio, but digging through them yielded no ore.
<br> 
<br> ‘How about it, Pat? Got anything?’
<br> 
<br> Pat braced himself to an effort.
<br> 
<br> ‘I like It Happened One Morning,’ he said — then looked desperately at his scrawl on the mimeograph paper, ‘or else — Grand Motel.’
<br> 
<br> Berners smiled.
<br> 
<br> ‘Grand Motel,’ he repeated. ‘By God! I think you’ve got something. Grand Motel.’
<br> 
<br> ‘I said Grand Hotel,’ said Pat.
<br> 
<br> ‘No, you didn’t. You said Grand Motel — and for my money it wins the fifty.’
<br> 
<br> ‘I’ve got to go lie down,’ announced Pat. ‘I feel sick.’
<br> 
<br> ‘There’s an empty office across the way. That’s a funny idea Pat, Grand Motel — or else Motel Clerk. How do you like that?’
<br> 
<br> As the fugitive quickened his step out the door Bee pressed the hat into his hands.
<br> 
<br> ‘Good work, old timer,’ she said.
<br> 
<br> Pat seized Mr Marcus’ hat, and stood holding it there like a bowl of soup.
<br> 
<br> ‘Feel — better — now,’ he mumbled after a moment. ‘Be back for the money.’
<br> 
<br> And carrying his burden he shambled toward the lavatory.
