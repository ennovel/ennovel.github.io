Scarcely an executive but is being gnawed at by some insoluble problem and in a democratic way he will let you in on it, with no charge. The problem, be it one of health or of production, is faced courageously and with groans at from one to five thousand a week. That’s how pictures are made.
<br> 
<br> ‘But this one has got me down,’ said Mr Banizon, ‘— because how did the artillery shell get in the trunk of Claudette Colbert or Betty Field or whoever we decide to use? We got to explain it so the audience will believe it.’
<br> 
<br> He was in the office of Louie the studio bookie and his present audience also included Pat Hobby, venerable script-stooge of forty-nine. Mr Banizon did not expect a suggestion from either of them but he had been talking aloud to himself about the problem for a week now and was unable to stop.
<br> 
<br> ‘Who’s your writer on it?’ asked Louie.
<br> 
<br> ‘R. Parke Woll,’ said Banizon indignantly. ‘First I buy this opening from another writer, see. A grand notion but only a notion. Then I call in R. Parke Woll, the playwright, and we meet a couple of times and develop it. Then when we get the end in sight, his agent horns in and says he won’t let Woll talk any more unless I give him a contract — eight weeks at $3,000! And all I need him for is one more day!’
<br> 
<br> The sum brought a glitter into Pat’s old eyes. Ten years ago he had camped beatifically in range of such a salary — now he was lucky to get a few weeks at $250. His inflamed and burnt over talent had failed to produce a second growth.
<br> 
<br> ‘The worse part of it is that Woll told me the ending,’ continued the producer.
<br> 
<br> ‘Then what are you waiting for?’ demanded Pat. ‘You don’t need to pay him a cent.’
<br> 
<br> ‘I forgot it!’ groaned Mr Banizon. ‘Two phones were ringing at once in my office — one from a working director. And while I was talking Woll had to run along. Now I can’t remember it and I can’t get him back.’
<br> 
<br> Perversely Pat Hobby’s sense of justice was with the producer, not the writer. Banizon had almost outsmarted Woll and then been cheated by a tough break. And now the playwright, with the insolence of an Eastern snob, was holding him up for twenty-four grand. What with the European market gone. What with the war.
<br> 
<br> ‘Now he’s on a big bat,’ said Banizon. ‘I know because I got a man tailing him. It’s enough to drive you nuts — here I got the whole story except the pay-off. What good is it to me like that?’
<br> 
<br> ‘If he’s drunk maybe he’d spill it,’ suggested Louie practically.
<br> 
<br> ‘Not to me,’ said Mr Banizon. ‘I thought of it but he would recognize my face.’
<br> 
<br> Having reached the end of his current blind alley, Mr Banizon picked a horse in the third and one in the seventh and prepared to depart.
<br> 
<br> ‘I got an idea,’ said Pat.
<br> 
<br> Mr Banizon looked suspiciously at the red old eyes.
<br> 
<br> ‘I got no time to hear it now,’ he said.
<br> 
<br> ‘I’m not selling anything,’ Pat reassured him. ‘I got a deal almost ready over at Paramount. But once I worked with this R. Parke Woll and maybe I could find what you want to know.’
<br> 
<br> He and Mr Banizon went out of the office together and walked slowly across the lot. An hour later, for an advance consideration of fifty dollars, Pat was employed to discover how a live artillery shell got into Claudette Colbert’s trunk or Betty Field’s trunk or whosoever’s trunk it should be.
