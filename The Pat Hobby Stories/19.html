It is a difficult business, for example, when the borrower is cockeyed, or has measles, or a conspicuous shiner. One could continue indefinitely but the inauspicious occasions can be catalogued as one — it is exceedingly difficult to borrow money when one needs it.
<br> 
<br> Pat Hobby found it difficult in the case of an actor on a set during the shooting of a moving picture. It was about the stiffest chore he had ever undertaken but he was doing it to save his car. To a sordidly commercial glance the jalopy would not have seemed worth saving but, because of Hollywood’s great distances, it was an indispensable tool of the writer’s trade.
<br> 
<br> ‘The finance company —’ explained Pat, but Gyp McCarthy interrupted.
<br> 
<br> ‘I got some business in this next take. You want me to blow up on it?’
<br> 
<br> ‘I only need twenty,’ persisted Pat. ‘I can’t get jobs if I have to hang around my bedroom.’
<br> 
<br> ‘You’d save money that way — you don’t get jobs anymore.’
<br> 
<br> This was cruelly correct. But working or not Pat liked to pass his days in or near a studio. He had reached a dolorous and precarious forty-nine with nothing else to do.
<br> 
<br> ‘I got a rewrite job promised for next week,’ he lied.
<br> 
<br> ‘Oh, nuts to you,’ said Gyp. ‘You better get off the set before Hilliard sees you.’
<br> 
<br> Pat glanced nervously toward the group by the camera — then he played his trump card.
<br> 
<br> ‘Once —’ he said,’— once I paid for you to have a baby.’
<br> 
<br> ‘Sure you did!’ said Gyp wrathfully. ‘That was sixteen years ago. And where is it now — it’s in jail for running over an old lady without a licence.’
<br> 
<br> ‘Well I paid for it,’ said Pat. ‘Two hundred smackers.’
<br> 
<br> ‘That’s nothing to what it cost me. Would I be stunting at my age if I had dough to lend? Would I be working at all?’
<br> 
<br> From somewhere in the darkness an assistant director issued an order:
<br> 
<br> ‘Ready to go!’
<br> 
<br> Pat spoke quickly.
<br> 
<br> ‘All right,’ he said. ‘Five bucks.’
<br> 
<br> ‘No.’
<br> 
<br> ‘All right then,’ Pat’s red-rimmed eyes tightened. ‘I’m going to stand over there and put the hex on you while you say your line.’
<br> 
<br> ‘Oh, for God’s sake!’ said Gyp uneasily. ‘Listen, I’ll give you five. It’s in my coat over there. Here, I’ll get it.’
<br> 
<br> He dashed from the set and Pat heaved a sigh of relief. Maybe Louie, the studio bookie, would let him have ten more.
<br> 
<br> Again the assistant director’s voice:
<br> 
<br> ‘Quiet! . . . We’ll take it now! . . . Lights!’
<br> 
<br> The glare stabbed into Pat’s eyes, blinding him. He took a step the wrong way — then back. Six other people were in the take — a gangster’s hide-out — and it seemed that each was in his way.
<br> 
<br> ‘All right . . . Roll ’em . . . We’re turning!’
<br> 
<br> In his panic Pat had stepped behind a flat which would effectually conceal him. While the actors played their scene he stood there trembling a little, his back hunched — quite unaware that it was a ‘trolley shot’, that the camera, moving forward on its track, was almost upon him.
<br> 
<br> ‘You by the window — hey you, Gyp! hands up.’
<br> 
<br> Like a man in a dream Pat raised his hands — only then did he realize that he was looking directly into a great black lens — in an instant it also included the English leading woman, who ran past him and jumped out the window. After an interminable second Pat heard the order ‘Cut.’
<br> 
<br> Then he rushed blindly through a property door, around a corner, tripping over a cable, recovering himself and tearing for the entrance. He heard footsteps running behind him and increased his gait, but in the doorway itself he was overtaken and turned defensively.
<br> 
<br> It was the English actress.
<br> 
<br> ‘Hurry up!’ she cried. ‘That finishes my work. I’m flying home to England.’
<br> 
<br> As she scrambled into her waiting limousine she threw back a last irrelevant remark. ‘I’m catching a New York plane in an hour.’
<br> 
<br> Who cares! Pat thought bitterly, as he scurried away.
<br> 
<br> He was unaware that her repatriation was to change the course of his life.
