MARK AT HOME.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      Mark's home was a small cottage of a story and a half, surmounted by a sloping roof. It was plainly furnished, but looked comfortable. His mother was a pleasant looking woman of middle age, who managed well their scanty income, consisting chiefly of Mark's earnings.
<br> 
<br> "Are you not later than usual, Mark?" she inquired.
<br> 
<br> "Yes, mother; I went out gunning, and did an errand for old Anthony, who is laid up with the rheumatism in his cabin."
<br> 
<br> "Poor man! I hope he won't suffer."
<br> 
<br> "Thanks to me, he probably will not."
<br> 
<br> "What can you do for him, Mark? You have no money to spare."
<br> 
<br> "Haven't I, mother?" asked Mark, with a smile, as he drew from his pocket a large handful of silver and gold.
<br> 
<br> "What do you say to that?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, Mark! I hope you came honestly by that money," said the widow, nervously.
<br> 
<br> "I haven't been robbing a bank, if that's what you mean, mother. I couldn't very well, as there is none within ten miles."
<br> 
<br> "Then, Mark, where did the money come from?"
<br> 
<br> "It belongs to old Anthony. He asked me to take charge of it, as I shall need to be buying things for him in the village for a few days to come."
<br> 
<br> "For mercy's sake, be careful of it, Mark, as, if you lost it, we couldn't make up the loss."
<br> 
<br> "I'll look after that. In fact, I think it will be safer with me than with the owner. If any dishonest person should enter his cabin, he could not help being robbed in his present condition."
<br> 
<br> "That would be very unfortunate, as the old man is probably very poor."
<br> 
<br> Mark was about to undeceive his mother, but, reflecting that Lyman Taylor might still be in the village, he thought it not prudent to betray the hermit's secret.
<br> 
<br> "I heard a report to-day, Mark," said his mother, as she was setting the supper table, "that the shoe-shop was to be closed for a month."
<br> 
<br> "I hope not," said Mark, startled. "That would be serious for us."
<br> 
<br> "And for others too, Mark."
<br> 
<br> "Yes. It isn't as if there were other employments open, but there is absolutely nothing, unless I could get a chance to do some farm work."
<br> 
<br> "Perhaps Deacon Miller may need a boy."
<br> 
<br> "He's about the last man I would work for. He wouldn't pay me a cent."
<br> 
<br> "Why not, Mark? He wouldn't expect you to work for nothing."
<br> 
<br> "He claims that I owe him forty-five dollars, and would expect me to work it out."
<br> 
<br> "What do you mean, Mark? How can you owe the deacon forty-five dollars?"
<br> 
<br> "I don't, but he claims I do."
<br> 
<br> Mark then told his mother the story of the cow.
<br> 
<br> "Deacon Miller expects me to pay for it," he concluded, "but I think he'll have to take it out in expecting."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, Mark, I am afraid this will lead to serious trouble," said Mrs. Manning, looking distressed. "He may go to law about it."
<br> 
<br> "He can't make me pay for the damage somebody else did, mother."
<br> 
<br> "But if he makes out that you shot the cow?"
<br> 
<br> "I won't trouble about it. It might spoil my appetite for supper. I've got a healthy appetite to-night, mother."
<br> 
<br> "Your story has taken away mine, Mark."
<br> 
<br> "Don't worry, mother; it will all come right."
<br> 
<br> "I am afraid worrying comes natural to me, Mark. I've seen more trouble than you have, my son."
<br> 
<br> "Forget it all till supper is over, mother."
<br> 
<br> Supper was scarcely over when a knock was heard at the door, and John Downie entered. He was a boy of Scotch descent, and lived near by.
<br> 
<br> "How are you, Johnny," said Mark, "won't you have some supper?"
<br> 
<br> "Thank you, Mark, I've had some. Have you heard about Deacon Miller's cow?"
<br> 
<br> "What about her?" asked Mark, eagerly.
<br> 
<br> "You know old Whitey?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, yes."
<br> 
<br> "Her eyes are put out by an accidental discharge of a gun, and I guess she will have to be killed."
<br> 
<br> "Do you know who shot her?" asked Mark, with intense interest.
<br> 
<br> "Yes, I do, but the deacon doesn't," answered John.
<br> 
<br> "Who was it?"
<br> 
<br> "James Collins. He and Tom Wyman were coming through the pasture, when James, in handling his gun awkwardly, managed to discharge it full in poor Whitey's face."
<br> 
<br> "How do you know it was James?"
<br> 
<br> "Because I saw it. I was in the next field and saw it all."
<br> 
<br> "Did the boys see you?"
<br> 
<br> "No; they hurried away as fast as they could go."
<br> 
<br> "Johnny, you're a trump!" exclaimed Mark, rising and shaking the boy's hand vigorously.
<br> 
<br> "Why am I a trump?" asked Johnny, astonished.
<br> 
<br> "Because your testimony will clear me. The deacon charges me with shooting the cow, and wants me to pay forty-five dollars."
<br> 
<br> "Gosh!" exclaimed Johnny. "But what makes him think you shot old Whitey?"
<br> 
<br> Mark briefly explained.
<br> 
<br> "But," said Mrs. Manning, "surely James Collins would not permit you to suffer for his fault?"
<br> 
<br> "You don't know James, mother. That's just what he would do, I feel sure. What do you say, Johnny?"
<br> 
<br> "Jim Collins is just mean enough to do it," answered John.
<br> 
<br> "He can't do it now, however. Mr. Collins is abundantly able to pay for the cow, and I guess he'll have to."
<br> 
<br> "I don't know how we could ever have paid so large a sum," said the widow.
<br> 
<br> "We shan't have to, mother, that's one comfort."
<br> 
<br> "There's the deacon coming!" exclaimed Johnny, suddenly.
<br> 
<br> "So he is! Johnny, just run into the kitchen, and I'll call you when you're wanted. We'll have some fun. Mother, don't say a word till we hear what the deacon has to say."
<br> 
<br> By this time the deacon had knocked. Mrs. Manning admitted him, and he entered with a preliminary cough.
<br> 
<br> "Are your family well, deacon?" asked the mother.
<br> 
<br> "They're middlin', widder, which is a comfort. Families are often a source of trouble," and here the deacon glanced sharply at Mark, who, rather to his surprise, looked cool and composed.
<br> 
<br> "That may be, Deacon Miller, but I am thankful that Mark never gives me any trouble."
<br> 
<br> "Don't be too sure of that, ma'am," said the deacon, grimly. "It's about that very thing I've come here now. Your son has shot my most valuable cow, old Whitey, and I regret to say, widder, that he'll have to make it good for me. Forty-five dollars is what the critter is worth, and I wouldn't have taken that for her."
<br> 
<br> "Are you sure Mark shot your cow?" asked Mrs. Manning.
<br> 
<br> "As sure as I need to be. I caught him standin' by the cow with his gun in his hand. The barrel was empty, for I tried it to see."
<br> 
<br> "What have you to say to this charge, Mark?"
<br> 
<br> "That Deacon Miller is mistaken. I did not shoot his cow."
<br> 
<br> "I reckon you'll have to pay for it all the same. Mark Manning. I don't want to be hard on a poor widder, but it stands to reason that I should be paid for my cow."
<br> 
<br> "I agree to that," said Mark, "but I'm not the one."
<br> 
<br> "Mebbe the cow shot herself!" said the deacon, sarcastically. "It may be nat'ral for cows to commit suicide, but I never saw one do it as far as I can remember. Young man, your story is too thin."
