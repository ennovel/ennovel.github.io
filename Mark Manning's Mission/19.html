THE HERMIT RECEIVES A CALL.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      Old Anthony was sitting in his doorway, thoughtfully smoking a pipe, when, chancing to lift his eyes, his gaze fell upon the figure of his nephew advancing towards the cabin. It was a surprise, and not a pleasant one. He could not divine Lyman's object in making this second visit.
<br> 
<br> "How are you getting along, Uncle Anthony?" inquired Lyman, in a conciliatory tone.
<br> 
<br> "Have you come all the way from New York to ask me that question?" said the hermit, dryly.
<br> 
<br> "Well, not altogether. Still, I wanted to know whether you were better."
<br> 
<br> "I have got over my rheumatic attack," said Anthony, shortly.
<br> 
<br> "I'm very glad. At your age it must be uncomfortable to be sick—especially in such a place. Can't I persuade you to come to New York, and take comfortable lodgings?"
<br> 
<br> "Why should you desire it? Perhaps you would propose to live with me?"
<br> 
<br> "And if I did, being your only relative, it would be natural enough. With your means——"
<br> 
<br> "What do you know of my means?" demanded the hermit, sharply.
<br> 
<br> "I have reason to think you are better off than your position would indicate," announced Lyman, watching the effect of the assertion on his uncle.
<br> 
<br> "What reason?" inquired Anthony.
<br> 
<br> "Well, I know you were very successful in California—after I left you. You struck it rich, made a great deal of money, and then sold the claim for a good round sum."
<br> 
<br> Anthony's countenance did not change, though the communication was by no means a welcome one.
<br> 
<br> "How much of this money do you think I have now?" he asked, at length.
<br> 
<br> "I don't know."
<br> 
<br> "And I don't propose to tell you."
<br> 
<br> "I know you have some of it!"
<br> 
<br> "Very possibly. I cannot live for nothing."
<br> 
<br> "And I know where you keep it," added Lyman, provoked by his uncle's manner.
<br> 
<br> "Indeed!"
<br> 
<br> "But I can't commend your prudence in putting your money where it is so likely to be found—and taken."
<br> 
<br> "Be a little more explicit. Let me know just what you mean."
<br> 
<br> "Burying money in the ground is not very wise."
<br> 
<br> Old Anthony was taken by surprise, and showed it.
<br> 
<br> "So you know this? Where did you obtain the information?" he asked.
<br> 
<br> "From some one who saw you and the boy, Mark, digging for it."
<br> 
<br> "Well," said the old man, quietly, "I know of no better place. People are honest round here, and it will not be taken."
<br> 
<br> "I agree with you there, Uncle Anthony. It won't be taken for a very good reason. There is none there. The jar is empty."
<br> 
<br> "How do you know this, Lyman?" demanded the hermit, with a searching look.
<br> 
<br> Lyman hesitated, but it seemed necessary to tell the truth.
<br> 
<br> "Because, when I learned that you had been so imprudent as to let the boy into your secret, I concluded at once that he would take advantage of his knowledge, and rob you. I therefore uncovered the place, and found it as I suspected. The jar is empty."
<br> 
<br> Old Anthony betrayed no excitement on hearing this.
<br> 
<br> "It is quite true," he said, quietly. "All the gold has been taken."
<br> 
<br> "You knew this?"
<br> 
<br> "Certainly. I took the last gold piece myself. Having no occasion for the jar, I left it there. You are certainly very kind to take so much interest in the safety of my property, but it is needless. I am still able to take care of what money I have left."
<br> 
<br> Lyman's face fell. He began to suspect that this was only too true.
