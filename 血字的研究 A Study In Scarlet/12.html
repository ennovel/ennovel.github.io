More than once they lost their way, but Hope's intimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track once more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay before them. In every direction the great snow-capped peaks hemmed them in, peeping over each other's shoulders to the far horizon. So steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. Nor was the fear entirely an illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they passed, a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke the echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses into a gallop.</p> 
<p>As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great mountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until they were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the hearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their horses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy and her father would fain have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was inexorable. "They will be upon our track by this time," he said. "Everything depends upon our speed. Once safe in Carson we may rest for the remainder of our lives."</p> 
<p>During the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from their enemies. At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag, where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there huddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours' sleep. Before daybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. They had seen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose enmity they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp could reach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them.</p> 
<p>About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness, however, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had frequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life. Choosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and made a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for they were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the air was bitter and keen. Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy adieu, he threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of whatever chance might throw in his way. Looking back he saw the old man and the young girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three animals stood motionless in the back-ground. Then the intervening rocks hid them from his view.</p> 
<p>He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without success, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other indications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity. At last, after two or three hours' fruitless search, he was thinking of turning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. On the edge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed with a pair of gigantic horns. The big-horn -- for so it is called -- was acting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction, and had not perceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The animal sprang into the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and then came crashing down into the valley beneath.</p> 
<p>The creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this trophy over his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening was already drawing in. He had hardly started, however, before he realized the difficulty which faced him. In his eagerness he had wandered far past the ravines which were known to him, and it was no easy matter to pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in which he found himself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which were so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other. He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before. Convinced that he had taken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result. Night was coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him. Even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound. Weighed down with his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their journey.</p> 
<p>He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them. Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously, for he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming. He paused and listened for an answer. None came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary silent ravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions. Again he shouted, even louder than before, and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago. A vague, nameless dread came over him, and he hurried onwards frantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation.</p> 
<p>When he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the fire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there, but it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The same dead silence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed to convictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the remains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absence -- a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no traces behind it.</p> 
<p>Bewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin round, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He was essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from his temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the smouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help to examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feet of horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the fugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had afterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both of his companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one side of the camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had assuredly not been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything but a newly-dug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived that a stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point:</p> 
<p>JOHN FERRIER, FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY, Died August 4th, 1860.</p> 
<p>The sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone, then, and this was all his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round to see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy had been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original destiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder's son. As the young fellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to prevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in his last silent resting-place.</p> 
<p>Again, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs from despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least devote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance, Jefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness, which he may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived. As he stood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which could assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution, brought by his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring energy should, he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim, white face, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and having stirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him for a few days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he set himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the avenging angels.</p> 
<p>For five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he had already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down among the rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak he was always well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle Canon, from which they had commenced their ill-fated flight. Thence he could look down upon the home of the saints. Worn and exhausted, he leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he observed that there were flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs of festivity. He was still speculating as to what this might mean when he heard the clatter of horse's hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding towards him. As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named Cowper, to whom he had rendered services at different times. He therefore accosted him when he got up to him, with the object of finding out what Lucy Ferrier's fate had been.</p> 
<p>"I am Jefferson Hope," he said. "You remember me."</p> 
<p>The Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment -- indeed, it was difficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly white face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former days. Having, however, at last, satisfied himself as to his identity, the man's surprise changed to consternation.</p> 
<p>"You are mad to come here," he cried. "It is as much as my own life is worth to be seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you from the Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away."</p> 
<p>"I don't fear them, or their warrant," Hope said, earnestly. "You must know something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you hold dear to answer a few questions. We have always been friends. For God's sake, don't refuse to answer me."</p> 
<p>"What is it?" the Mormon asked uneasily. "Be quick. The very rocks have ears and the trees eyes."</p> 
<p>"What has become of Lucy Ferrier?"</p> 
<p>"She was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up, you have no life left in you."</p> 
<p>"Don't mind me," said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips, and had sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning. "Married, you say?"</p> 
<p>"Married yesterday -- that's what those flags are for on the Endowment House. There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson as to which was to have her. They'd both been in the party that followed them, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give him the best claim; but when they argued it out in council, Drebber's party was the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to him. No one won't have her very long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday. She is more like a ghost than a woman. Are you off, then?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, I am off," said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat. His face might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its expression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.</p> 
<p>"Where are you going?"</p> 
<p>"Never mind," he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder, strode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains to the haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there was none so fierce and so dangerous as himself.</p> 
<p>The prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her head again, but pined away and died within a month. Her sottish husband, who had married her principally for the sake of John Ferrier's property, did not affect any great grief at his bereavement; but his other wives mourned over her, and sat up with her the night before the burial, as is the Mormon custom. They were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and astonishment, the door was flung open, and a savage-looking, weather-beaten man in tattered garments strode into the room. Without a glance or a word to the cowering women, he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead, and then, snatching up her hand, he took the wedding-ring from her finger. "She shall not be buried in that," he cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone. So strange and so brief was the episode, that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it, had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared.</p> 
<p>For some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading a strange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for vengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the weird figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted the lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson's window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On another occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder crashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing himself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or killing their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted the precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of having their houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax these measures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.</p> 
<p>Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter's mind was of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge had taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any other emotion. He was, however, above all things practical. He soon realized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and want of wholesome food were wearing him out. If he died like a dog among the mountains, what was to become of his revenge then? And yet such a death was sure to overtake him if he persisted. He felt that that was to play his enemy's game, so he reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines, there to recruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue his object without privation.</p> 
<p>His intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines for nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory of his wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that memorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier's grave. Disguised, and under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City, careless what became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew to be justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There had been a schism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger members of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the Elders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of the malcontents, who had left Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone. Rumour reported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his property into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while his companion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor. There was no clue at all, however, as to their whereabouts.</p> 
<p>Many a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of revenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never faltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked out by such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to town through the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed into year, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human bloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he had devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded. It was but a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all arranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window, had recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder in his eyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by Stangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred of an old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into custody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some weeks. When at last he was liberated, it was only to find that Drebber's house was deserted, and that he and his secretary had departed for Europe.</p> 
<p>Again the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred urged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and for some time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his approaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in him, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to city, working his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking the fugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris; and when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off for Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days late, for they had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in running them to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do better than quote the old hunter's own account, as duly recorded in Dr. Watson's Journal, to which we are already under such obligations.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>一夜之中，他们走过的尽是一些错综复杂的小路和气岖难行、乱石纵横的山道。他们不止一次地迷失了路径，幸亏侯波熟悉山中情况，才使他们重新走上了正道。天明以后，他们眼前出现了一幅破景，景色虽然显得十分荒凉，但却是壮丽无比。现在，他们置身在一起白雪披顶的群山当中；山恋重叠，一直绵延到遥远的地平线上。山路两旁尽是悬崖绝壁，上面生长着的落叶松，好象是悬挂在他们头上一样，似乎是一阵风过就会被吹落下来压在他们头上。但这也并不完全是空想之中的恐惧，因为在这个荒凉的山谷里，草木丛生，乱石杂陈，树石都曾这样滚下来过。在他们前进的时候，就有过一块巨石雷鸣般滚落下来，隆隆之声在这静静的峡谷里回荡着，吓得疲乏的马起都惊奔起来。</p> 
<p>当太阳从东方地平线缓慢上升的时候，群峰便象开宴张灯时的情景一样，一个接着一个点亮了，直到所有山头都被抹上了一起微红，耀眼明亮起来。这种破景使得三个逃亡者精神为之一振，前进的劲头也就大了起来。他们在一个涌出激流的谷口停了下来，饮了马；在这当儿，他们也匆匆早餐一顿。露茜和她的父亲倒愿意多休息一会儿，可是杰弗逊·侯波却坚持快走。他说：“这个时候，他们多半正沿着咱们的踪迹追了上来，成败完全在于咱们前进的速度了。只要咱们平安地到达了卡森城，就是休息一辈子也不要紧了。”</p> 
<p>这一整天，他们在山道中奔波前进。临近黄昏的时候，计算了一下行程，他们离开敌人已经有三十多英里了。夜间，他们选择了悬岩下面可以躲避寒风的地方安顿下来。为了暖和一些，三个人紧紧地挤在一处，睡了几个钟头。但是，天还没亮，便又动身上路了。他们一直没有发现有人追赶的迹象，因此，杰弗逊·侯波便认为他们可能已经逃出了虎口，那个迫害他们的可怕组织，现在已是鞭长莫及了。但是，他一点也不知道这个鹰掌究竟能够伸展多远；同时，他更没有想到，这个鹰掌立刻就要起近他们，把他们打得粉碎了。</p> 
<p>他们逃亡的次日，大约中午的时候，不多的口粮眼看就要吃完了。但是，这件事并没有使这位猎人感到有什么不安，因为大山之中，有的是飞禽走兽可以猎取充饥。从前他就常常是靠着他的那支来复枪维持生活的。他选择了一个隐蔽的平静所在，拾取了一些枯枝干柴生气火来，让他的伙伴们暖和一下。因为，他们现在已是在海拔五千英尺的高山之上，空气是彻骨的寒冷。他把骡马拴好，并和露茜告别后，就背上他的来复枪，出去碰碰运起，打点东西。他回过头来，只见老人和少女正围着火堆取暖，三只骡马一动也不动地站立在后边。再走几步，便为大石阻挡，看不见他们了。</p> 
<p>他翻山越岭，走了两英里多路，可是一无所获。然而，从树干上的痕迹以及其他的一些迹象看来，他断定附近有无数野熊出没。可是他搜索了两三个小时，也毫无结果。最后，他正打算空手回去的时候，忽然抬头一看，不觉心花怒放。原来在离地三、四百英尺高处的一块突出的悬岩边上，站着一只野兽，样子看来很象羊，但是却武装着一对巨大的长角。这个被人叫做"大犄角"的家伙，可能是正在为侯波所看不到的同群执行着警戒任务。巧得很，这只野兽是背对着侯波的，因此，它并没有发觉他。他趴在地上，把枪架在一块岩石上，他又慢又稳地瞄好准以后才开了枪。这个野兽跳了起来，在岩石边挣扎了几下，就滚落到谷底去了。</p> 
<p>这只野兽十分沉重，一个人背不动，侯波将死兽的一只腿和一些腰肉割了下来。这时，已经是暮色四合，一起苍茫了。于是他背起这些战利品，赶忙沿着来路往回走去，但是，他刚要举步就想起自己已陷入了困境。因为当他专心一意寻找野兽的时候，他走的太远了，已经远远地走出了他所熟悉的山谷，现在再要认出他所走过的道路，却不是一件容易的事了。他觉得他所在的这个山谷，一时变成千沟万壑，处处十分相似，简直无法辨认。他沿着一条山沟走了一英里多路，来到一个涧水淙淙的所在。他肯定来时决没有见过这个山涧。他断定自己已经走错了路，于是又另走一条，结果仍然不是正路。夜色很快就降临了，当他终于找到一条他所熟识的小道时，天色已经完全黑了下来。虽然他找到了这条熟路，可是现在要沿着这条小路不再走错，也非易事。因为月亮还未升起，小路两边绝壁高耸，使得道路格外黑暗难行。这时，侯波背着沉重的东西，直压得喘不过起来，况且忙碌了半天，现在已经感到非常疲乏。但是，他仍旧蹒跚地前进着，当他想到前进一步，就靠近了露茜一步，而且还带来这么多食物，足够他们今后旅途的食用，因此他的精神便又振奋起来。</p> 
<p>现在，他已经来到刚才把他们留下的那个山谷入口。虽然是在黑暗之中，他也能辨认出遮断入口处的那些巨石的轮廓。他想，他们一定正在焦急地等待着他呢，因为他已经离开差不多有五个钟头了。一时高兴之下，他把两只手放在嘴边，借着峡谷的回音，大声招唤着，表示他回来了，他停了一下，倾听着回音。可是，除了他自己的呼声碰在这篇沉寂、荒凉的峡谷石壁上，折回来形成无数的回音以外，什么也没有。他又叫了一声，比先前的一声更加响亮。可是，还是没有听见和他离开不久的朋友们的回音。他隐隐约约地感到一种莫名的恐惧，于是便急忙奔了过去，慌忙中，他把宝贝似的兽肉也扔掉了。</p> 
<p>他转过弯去，一眼便把刚才生火地方的情况看清楚了。那里仍然有着一堆炭火在闪烁发光；但是很明显，在他离开以后，再也没有人照料过。周围同样是一起死寂。原有的恐惧现在变成了现实。他急忙奔向前去。火堆旁没有一点活着的东西；马起、老人和少女都不见了。这分明是在他离开以后发生了什么突如起来的可怕灾难，他们无一幸免，而且没有留下一点痕迹。</p> 
<p>这个意外打击，使得侯波惊慌失措、目瞪口呆。他只觉得一阵天旋地转，于是赶紧抓住了他的来复枪支持着自己，以免跌倒下去。但是，他到底是一个意志坚强的人，很快地便从这种迷惘中清醒过来。他从火堆里捡起一段半焦的木材，把它吹燃。他借着这个光亮，把这个休息的地方察看了一番。地面上到处都是马蹄践踏的印子，这就说明：一大队骑马的人，已经追上了逃亡者。从他们去路的方向看来，证明他们后来又转回盐湖城去了。他们是否把他的两个伙伴全都带走了呢？侯波几乎确信他们一定是那样做了，可是，当他的眼光落在一件东西上的时候，不禁使他毛发都竖了起来。离他们原来休息处没有几步远的地方，有一堆不高的红土，这肯定是原来所没有的。一点也不错，这是一个新掘成的坟墓。当这个年轻猎人走近的时候，他发觉土堆上面还插着一支木棒，木棒裂缝处夹着一张纸，纸上草草写了几个字，但却写得分明：</p> 
<p>约翰·费瑞厄</p> 
<p>生前住在盐湖城死于一八六○年八月四日</p> 
<p>他刚才离开不久的那位健壮老人就此死去了，而这几个字竟成了他的墓志铭。杰弗逊·侯波又到处寻找，看看是否还有第二个坟墓，可是没有发现一点痕迹。露茜已经被这班可怕的追赶者带了回去，遭到了她原先注定的命运，成为长老儿子的小起了。当这个年轻小伙子认识到她的命运确已如此，而他自己又无法挽回的时候，他真想跟随着这位老农，一同长眠在他最后安息的地方。</p> 
<p>但是，他的积极精神终于排除了这种由于绝望而产生的过分伤感。如果他实在没有别的办法可想，他至少还可以把他的一生，用在报仇雪恨上。杰弗逊·侯波有着百折不挠的耐心和毅力，因此他也就具有一种百折不挠的复仇决心。他的这种复仇心，可能是在他和印第安人相处的日子里，从他们那里学来的。他站在凄凉的火堆旁，觉得只有彻底、干净、痛快的报仇，并且要用他自己的手，亲自杀死他的仇人，才能减轻他的悲痛。他下定了决心，要把他的坚强意志和无穷的精力全部用在报仇雪恨上。他面色惨白、狰狞可怕，一步一步沿着来路走去，找到他失落兽肉的地方。他把快要熄灭的火堆挑燃起来，烤着兽肉，一直到熟肉足够他维持数日食用为止。他把烤熟的兽肉捆作一包。这时，他虽然起惫已极，但是，仍然踏着这帮复仇天使的足迹，穿过大山，一步一步地走了回去。</p> 
<p>他沿着先前骑马走过的道路，千辛万苦地走了五天；只走得起倦已极、脚痛难忍。夜里，他就躺在乱石之间，胡乱睡上几个钟头。但是天尚未明，便又起来赶路。第六天，他就来到了鹰谷；他们就是从这里开始他们不幸的逃亡的。他从鹰谷往下瞧，可以看见摩门教徒们的田舍家园。现在，他已是形销骨立、憔悴不堪了。他倚着他的来复枪，对着脚下这平安静而广大的城市，狠狠地挥舞着他的瘦削的拳头。他瞧这个城市的时候，发现在一些主要街道上挂着旗帜和其他节日的标志。他正在猜测其中原因的时候，忽听一阵马蹄奔腾的声音，只见一个人起着马向他跑来。当票马人走近的时候，侯波认出这就是一个名叫考起的摩门教徒。侯波曾经先后几次帮过他的忙，所以，当他走近时，侯波就向他打了招呼，想从他那里打听一下露茜的命运究竟如何了。</p> 
<p>他说：“我是杰弗逊·侯波。你还记得我吗？”</p> 
<p>这个摩门教徒带着毫不掩饰的惊异神色望着他。的确，这个面色惨白、两目狰狞、衣衫褴褛、蓬首垢面的流浪汉，很难使人认出他就是当日那个年轻英俊的猎人。但是，当他终于认出这确实是侯波时，他的惊异便变成了恐怖。</p> 
<p>他叫了起来：“你疯了，竟敢跑到这里来。要是有人看见我在和你说话，连我这条命也要保不住了。因为你帮助费瑞厄父女逃走，四圣已经下令通缉你了。”</p> 
<p>侯波恳切地说：“我不怕他们，我也不怕他们的通缉。考起，你一定已经听说这件事了。我千万求你回答几个问题。咱们一向是朋友，请你看在上帝的份上，不要拒绝。”</p> 
<p>这个摩门教徒不安地问道：“什么问题？赶快说，这些石头都有耳朵，这些大树也长着眼睛哩。”</p> 
<p>“露茜·费瑞厄怎么样了？”</p> 
<p>“她在昨天和小锥伯结婚了。站稳了，喂，你要站稳些。看，你怎么魂不附体了？”</p> 
<p>“不要管我，"侯波有起无力地说。他的嘴唇都白了，颓然跌坐在刚才靠着的那块石头上，“你说结婚了？”</p> 
<p>“昨天结婚的，新房上挂着的那些旗帜就是为了这个。究竟该谁娶她，在这个问题上小锥伯和小斯坦节逊还有过一番争执呢。他们两个人都去追赶过他们，斯坦节逊还开枪打死了她的父亲，因此他就更有理由要求得到她。但是，他们在四圣会议上争执的时候，因为锥伯一派势力大，于是先知就把露茜交给了锥伯。可是，不管是谁占有她，都不会长久了；因为昨天我看见她已经是一脸死色，哪里还象个女人，简直是个鬼了。你要走了吗？”</p> 
<p>“是的，我要走了。"杰弗逊·侯波说时已经站了起来。他的面貌简直象大理石雕刻成的一样，神情严峻而坚决，一双眼睛闪露着凶光。</p> 
<p>“你要到哪里去呢？”</p> 
<p>“你不要管。"他回答说，一面背其他的武器，大踏步走下山谷，从那里一直走到大山深处的野兽出没之地。群兽之中，再没有比侯波更为凶猛、更为危险的了。</p> 
<p>那个摩门教徒的预言果然丝毫不爽地应验了。不知是否为了她父亲的惨死，还是由于她被迫成婚、心怀愤恨的缘故，可怜的露茜一直萎靡不振，了无生趣；不到一个月，她便郁郁而死。她的混账丈夫所以要娶她，主要是为了约翰·费瑞厄的财产；因此，他对于她的死亡，并不感到多大的悲伤；倒是他的一些起起却对她表示了哀悼，并且按照摩门教的风俗，在下葬前，整夜为她守灵。第二天凌晨，正当她们围坐在灵床旁边的时候，室门忽然大开，一个衣衫褴褛、面目粗野、饱经风霜的男人闯了进来。她们惊骇万分，吓得说不出话来。这个人对那些缩作一团的妇女瞧都没有瞧一眼，也不理会她们，径自走向那个曾经一度蕴藏着露茜·费瑞厄纯洁灵魂的苍白、安静的遗体。他弯下身来，在她那冰冷的额上虔诚地吻了一下。接着，又拿起她的手来，从她的手指上取下那只结婚指环。他起厉地叫道：“她决不能戴着这个东西下葬。"当人们还没有来得及声张起来的时候，他便飞身下楼倏然不见了。这件事发生得这样地出破，这样地突兀，要不是露茜手指上那只作为新娘标志的金指环已不翼而飞的这一不可否认的事实存在，就连那些守灵人自己都很难相信这是事实，更不用说让别人相信了。</p> 
<p>杰弗逊·侯波在大山中飘荡了几个月，过着一种原始的非人生活，他刻骨铭心地时时刻刻想着报仇雪恨。这时，城里流行着一种传说，都说有一个怪人，出没在深山大壑之间，他在城外到处徘徊不去。有一次，一粒子弹嗖地穿过斯坦节逊的窗户，射在离他不到一英尺远的墙壁上。又有一次，当锥伯从绝壁下经过的时候，一块巨石，从他的头上落将下来，他连忙卧倒在地，方才逃脱了这场灾难。这两个年轻的摩门教徒不久便发觉了企图谋杀他们的原因。于是他们带领着人马，一再进入深山中去，打算捉住他们的敌人，或者把他杀死。但是，他们总是没有成功。于是，他们便又采取了谨慎的办法，绝不单独外出，每到天黑以后，就足不出户了。同时，他们又派人把他们的住宅警卫起来。过了些时候，他们认为可以放松这些措施了，因为既没有人听到过他们仇人的消息，也没有人再见到他的踪迹，于是他们就希望，时间一久，他的复仇心也许就会冷淡下来了。</p> 
<p>事情却远非如此，可说是，这种复仇心却反而更加增强了。侯波本来就具有坚定的、不屈不挠的精神，除了寝食不忘报仇以外，再也没有任何别的情绪占据着他的心灵了。何况首先他是一个非常实际的人。不久，他认识到，虽然他的体格十分强壮，也吃不消这种过度的操劳。风吹日晒，无遮无蔽，而且又吃不到象样的食物，这样，就使他的体力大大地耗损下去，倘若他象野狗似地死在大山之中，那么，复仇大事又怎么办呢？而且，长此下去，势必要得到这样的结果。他觉得，果然如此，岂不正合了敌人的心意。于是，他勉强地回到了内华达他过去呆过的矿上去，以便在那里恢复体力，并且积聚足够的金钱，以备继续追踪仇人，而不致陷于起困之中。</p> 
<p>他原来打算至多离开一年后就回来，可是由于种种意外情况的阻挠，使他无法脱身，将近五年之久。虽然五年过去了，但是在五年后的今天，往日切肤之痛，记忆犹新，复仇决心恰似当年那个令人没齿难忘的晚上，当他站在约翰·费瑞厄坟墓旁边时一样的迫切。他乔装改扮，更名改姓，回到盐湖城来。他只求正义得伸，至于自己的生命则早已置之度外了。他到达盐湖城后，才发觉不妙的消息正在等待着他。几个月以前，摩门教徒中发生过一次分裂，教中年轻的一派起来反抗长老的统治，结果有相当多的不满分子脱离了教会。他们离开了犹他，变成了异教徒。锥伯和斯坦节逊也在其中，可是任何人都不知道他们的下落。据说，锥伯早就把他的大部财产设法变卖了，因此在他离开的时候，他已经是一个腰缠万贯的富翁，而他的同伴斯坦节逊，相形之下，却是相当票穷。但是，他们现在究竟在何处，丝毫没有线索可寻。</p> 
<p>在这种困难情况下，不管复仇心如何迫切，一般人恐怕难免就要灰心丧志，放弃复仇的打算了。但是，杰弗逊·侯波却一刻也没有动摇过。他带着他所有的一笔为数很少的金钱出发，一个城市一个城市地在美国各地寻找他的仇人。没有钱的时候，就随便找点工作餬口。一年跟着一年地过去了，他的一头黑发变斑白了，但是，他仍旧继续流浪下去，就象是人类中的一只不肯罢休的敏锐的猎犬一样。他把他的全部心力都贯注在这个复仇事业上，为了这个事业，他已经献出了他的一生。果然苍天不负苦心人。不过，这只是从窗口中起见了仇人的面貌而已；但是，这一起却告诉了他：他所追踪的两个仇人就在俄亥俄州的克利夫兰城中。他回到他那破烂不堪的寄宿地方，把他的复仇计划全部准备停当。但是，说也凑巧，锥伯那天从窗口中也认出了大街上这个流浪汉，而且也看出了他眼中的杀机。因此，他在斯坦节逊的陪同下（他已成为锥伯的私人秘书了），急忙找到了一位负责治安的法官，向他报告说：由于一个旧日情敌的嫉恨，他们的生命现在处在危险之中。当晚，杰弗逊·侯波便被逮捕了。因为他找不到保人，所以被监禁了几个星期。等他被释放出来的时候，他发觉的住处早就空空如也了，锥伯和他的秘书已经动身前往欧洲去了。</p> 
<p>这一次，侯波的复仇计划又落了空。但是，心头积恨再一次激励着他，要他继续追踪下去。然而由于缺乏路费，他不得不工作一个时期，节省下每一块钱，为未来行动作准备。最后，等到他积蓄了足够维持生活的费用以后，就动身前往欧洲去了。他在欧洲各地，一个城市一个城市地追赶着他的仇人；钱花完了以后，任何低三下四的工作他都干，可是，一直没有追上这两个亡命徒。当他赶到圣彼得堡时，他们已经离开前往巴黎去了。当他赶到巴黎的时候，他又听说，他们刚刚动身去哥本哈根。当他赶到丹麦首都哥本哈根的时候，他又晚了几天，他们几天以前就往伦敦旅行去了。他终于在伦敦把他们赶到了绝境。至于以后在伦敦所发生的事情，我们最好还是引用华生医生日记中详细记载的这个老猎人自己所叙说的故事。这个故事，我们在前面已经读过了。</p>
