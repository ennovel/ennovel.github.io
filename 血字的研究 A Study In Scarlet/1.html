Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy's country. I followed, however, with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new duties.</p> 
<p>The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.</p> 
<p>Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to the base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little upon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse of our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the troopship "Orontes," and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.</p> 
<p>I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as air -- or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely than I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in my style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile.</p> 
<p>On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at the Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning round I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at Barts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and we started off together in a hansom.</p> 
<p>"Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?" he asked in undisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets. "You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut."</p> 
<p>I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it by the time that we reached our destination.</p> 
<p>"Poor devil!" he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my misfortunes. "What are you up to now?"</p> 
<p>"Looking for lodgings," I answered. "Trying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price."</p> 
<p>"That's a strange thing," remarked my companion; "you are the second man to-day that has used that expression to me."</p> 
<p>"And who was the first?" I asked.</p> 
<p>"A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital. He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which were too much for his purse."</p> 
<p>"By Jove!" I cried, "if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner to being alone."</p> 
<p>Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. "You don't know Sherlock Holmes yet," he said; "perhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion."</p> 
<p>"Why, what is there against him?"</p> 
<p>"Oh, I didn't say there was anything against him. He is a little queer in his ideas -- an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I know he is a decent fellow enough."</p> 
<p>"A medical student, I suppose?" said I.</p> 
<p>"No -- I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well up in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know, he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are very desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way knowledge which would astonish his professors."</p> 
<p>"Did you never ask him what he was going in for?" I asked.</p> 
<p>"No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him."</p> 
<p>"I should like to meet him," I said. "If I am to lodge with anyone, I should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How could I meet this friend of yours?"</p> 
<p>"He is sure to be at the laboratory," returned my companion. "He either avoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to night. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon."</p> 
<p>"Certainly," I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other channels.</p> 
<p>As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as a fellow-lodger.</p> 
<p>"You mustn't blame me if you don't get on with him," he said; "I know nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me responsible."</p> 
<p>"If we don't get on it will be easy to part company," I answered. "It seems to me, Stamford," I added, looking hard at my companion, "that you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow's temper so formidable, or what is it? Don't be mealy-mouthed about it."</p> 
<p>"It is not easy to express the inexpressible," he answered with a laugh. "Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes -- it approaches to cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would take it himself with the same readiness. He appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge."</p> 
<p>"Very right too."</p> 
<p>"Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape."</p> 
<p>"Beating the subjects!"</p> 
<p>"Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him at it with my own eyes."</p> 
<p>"And yet you say he is not a medical student?"</p> 
<p>"No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we are, and you must form your own impressions about him." As he spoke, we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which opened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me, and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.</p> 
<p>This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles. Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts, test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames. There was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. "I've found it! I've found it," he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a test-tube in his hand. "I have found a re-agent which is precipitated by haemoglobin, and by nothing else." Had he discovered a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his features.</p> 
<p>"Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said Stamford, introducing us.</p> 
<p>"How are you?" he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for which I should hardly have given him credit. "You have been in Afghanistan, I perceive."</p> 
<p>"How on earth did you know that?" I asked in astonishment.</p> 
<p>"Never mind," said he, chuckling to himself. "The question now is about hoemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?"</p> 
<p>"It is interesting, chemically, no doubt," I answered, "but practically ----"</p> 
<p>"Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years. Don't you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Come over here now!" He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness, and drew me over to the table at which he had been working. "Let us have some fresh blood," he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette. "Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction." As he spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then added some drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar.</p> 
<p>"Ha! ha!" he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a child with a new toy. "What do you think of that?"</p> 
<p>"It seems to be a very delicate test," I remarked.</p> 
<p>"Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test been invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes."</p> 
<p>"Indeed!" I murmured.</p> 
<p>"Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon them. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the Sherlock Holmes' test, and there will no longer be any difficulty."</p> 
<p>His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination.</p> 
<p>"You are to be congratulated," I remarked, considerably surprised at his enthusiasm.</p> 
<p>"There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier, and Samson of new Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive."</p> 
<p>"You seem to be a walking calendar of crime," said Stamford with a laugh. "You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the `Police News of the Past.'"</p> 
<p>"Very interesting reading it might be made, too," remarked Sherlock Holmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger. "I have to be careful," he continued, turning to me with a smile, "for I dabble with poisons a good deal." He held out his hand as he spoke, and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster, and discoloured with strong acids.</p> 
<p>"We came here on business," said Stamford, sitting down on a high three-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his foot. "My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought that I had better bring you together."</p> 
<p>Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with me. "I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street," he said, "which would suit us down to the ground. You don't mind the smell of strong tobacco, I hope?"</p> 
<p>"I always smoke `ship's' myself," I answered.</p> 
<p>"That's good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally do experiments. Would that annoy you?"</p> 
<p>"By no means."</p> 
<p>"Let me see -- what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at times, and don't open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I'll soon be right. What have you to confess now? It's just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they begin to live together."</p> 
<p>I laughed at this cross-examination. "I keep a bull pup," I said, "and I object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of vices when I'm well, but those are the principal ones at present."</p> 
<p>"Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?" he asked, anxiously.</p> 
<p>"It depends on the player," I answered. "A well-played violin is a treat for the gods -- a badly-played one ----"</p> 
<p>"Oh, that's all right," he cried, with a merry laugh. "I think we may consider the thing as settled -- that is, if the rooms are agreeable to you."</p> 
<p>"When shall we see them?"</p> 
<p>"Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we'll go together and settle everything," he answered.</p> 
<p>"All right -- noon exactly," said I, shaking his hand.</p> 
<p>We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards my hotel.</p> 
<p>"By the way," I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford, "how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?"</p> 
<p>My companion smiled an enigmatical smile. "That's just his little peculiarity," he said. "A good many people have wanted to know how he finds things out."</p> 
<p>"Oh! a mystery is it?" I cried, rubbing my hands. "This is very piquant. I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. `The proper study of mankind is man,' you know."</p> 
<p>"You must study him, then," Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye. "You'll find him a knotty problem, though. I'll wager he learns more about you than you about him. Good-bye."</p> 
<p>"Good-bye," I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably interested in my new acquaintance.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>一八七八年我在伦敦大学获得医学博士学位以后，就到内特黎去进修军医的必修课程。我在那里读完了我的课程以后，立刻就被派往诺桑伯兰第五明火枪团充当军医助理。这个团当时驻扎在印度。在我还没有赶到部队以前，第二次阿富汗战役就爆发了。我在孟买上岸的时候，听说我所属的那个部队已经穿过山隘，向前挺进，深入敌境了。虽然如此，我还是跟着一群和我一样掉队的军官赶上前去，平安地到达了坎达哈。我在那里找到了我的团，马上担负起我的新职务。</p> 
<p>这次战役给许多人带来了升迁和荣誉，但是带给我的却只是不幸和灾难。我在被转调到巴克州旅以后，就和这个旅一起参加了迈旺德那场决死的激战。在这次战役中，我的肩部中了一粒捷则尔枪弹，打碎了肩骨，擦伤了锁骨下面的动脉。①若不是我那忠勇的勤务兵摩瑞把我抓起来扔到一起驮马的背上，安全地把我带回英国阵地来，我就要落到那些残忍的嘎吉人的手中了。②</p> 
<p>①捷则尔为一种笨重的阿富汗枪的名称。——译者注</p> 
<p>②回教徒士兵。——译者注</p> 
<p>创痛使我形销骨立，再加上长期的辗转劳顿，使我更加虚弱不堪。于是我就和一大批伤员一起，被送到了波舒尔的后方医院。在那里，我的健康状况大大好转起来，可是当我已经能够在病房中稍稍走动，甚至还能在走廊上晒一会儿太阳的时候，我又病倒了，染上了我们印度属地的那种倒霉疫症——伤寒。有好几个月，我都是昏迷不醒，奄奄一息。最后我终于恢复了神智，逐渐痊愈起来。但是病后我的身体十分虚弱、憔悴，因此经过医生会诊后，决定立即将我送回英国，一天也不许耽搁。于是，我就乘运兵船"奥仑梯兹号"被遣送回国。一个月以后，我便在普次茅斯的码头登岸了。那时，我的健康已是糟糕透了，几乎达到难以恢复的地步。但是，好心的政府给了我九个月的假期，使我将养身体。</p> 
<p>我在英国无亲无友，所以就象空气一样的自由；或者说是象一个每天收入十一先令六便士的人那样逍遥自在。在这种情况下，我很自然地就被吸引进伦敦这个大污水坑里去，大英帝国所有的游民懒汉也都是汇集到这里来的。我在伦敦河滨马路上的一家公寓里住了一些时候，过着既不舒适又非常无聊的生活，钱一到手就花光了，大大地超过了我所能负担的开支，因此我的经济情况变得非常恐慌起来。我不久就看了出来：我必须离开这个大都市移居到乡下去；要不就得彻底改变我的生活方式。我选定了后一个办法，决心离开这家公寓，另找一个不太奢侈而又化费不大的住处。</p> 
<p>就在我决定这样做的那天，我正站在克莱梯利安酒吧门前的时候，忽然有人拍了拍我的肩膀。我回头一看，原来是小斯坦弗。他是我在巴茨时的一个助手。在这茫茫人海的伦敦城中，居然能够碰到一个熟人，对于一个孤独的人来说，确是一件令人非常愉快的事。斯坦弗当日并不是和我特别要好的朋友，但现在我竟热情地向他招呼起来。他见到我，似乎也很高兴。我在狂喜之余，立刻邀他到侯本餐厅去吃午饭；于是我们就一同乘车前往。</p> 
<p>当我们的车子辚辚地穿过伦敦热闹街道的时候，他很惊破地问我：“华生，你近来干些什么？看你面黄肌瘦，只剩了一把骨头了。”</p> 
<p>我把我的危险经历简单地对他叙述了一下。我的话还没有讲完，我们就到达了目的地。</p> 
<p>他听完了我的不幸遭遇以后，怜悯地说：“可怜的家伙！你现在作何打算呢？"我回答说：“我想找个住处，打算租几间价钱不高而又舒适一些的房子，不知道这个问题能不能够解决。”</p> 
<p>我的伙伴说：“这真是怪事，今天你是第二个对我说这样话的人了。”</p> 
<p>我问道：“头一个是谁？”</p> 
<p>“是一个在医院化验室工作的。今天早晨他还在唉声叹气，因为他找到了几间好房子，但是，租金很贵，他一个人住不起，又找不到人跟他合租。”</p> 
<p>我说：“好啊，如果他真的要找个人合住的话，我倒正是他要找的人。我觉得有个伴儿比独自一个儿住要好的多。”</p> 
<p>小斯坦弗从酒杯上很惊破地望着我，他说：“你还不知道歇洛克·福尔摩斯吧，否则你也许会不愿意和他作一个长年相处的伙伴哩。”</p> 
<p>“为什么，难道他有什么不好的地方吗？”</p> 
<p>“哦，我不是说他有什么不好的地方。他只是思想上有些古怪而已——他老是孜孜不倦地在研究一些科学。据我所知，他倒是个很正派的人。”</p> 
<p>我说：“也许他是一个学医的吧？”</p> 
<p>“不是，我一点也摸不清他在钻研些什么。我相信他精于解剖学，又是个第一流的药剂师。但是，据我了解，他从来没有系统地学过医学。他所研究的东西非常杂乱，不成系统，并且也很离破；但是他却积累了不少稀破古怪的知识，足以使他的教授都感到惊讶。”</p> 
<p>我问道：“你从来没有问过他在钻研些什么吗？”</p> 
<p>“没有，他是不轻易说出心里话的，虽然在他高兴的时候，他也是滔滔不绝地很爱说话。”</p> 
<p>我说：“我倒愿意见见他。如果我要和别人合住，我倒宁愿跟一个好学而又沉静的人住在一起。我现在身体还不大结实，受不了吵闹和刺激。我在阿富汗已经尝够了那种滋味，这一辈子再也不想受了。我怎样才能见到你的这位朋友呢？”</p> 
<p>我的同伴回答说：“他现在一定是在化验室里。他要么就几个星期不去，要么就从早到晚在那里工作。如果你愿意的话，咱们吃完饭就坐车一块儿去。”</p> 
<p>“当然愿意啦！"我说，于是我们又转到别的话题上去。</p> 
<p>在我们离开侯本前往医院去的路上，斯坦弗又给我讲了一些关于那位先生的详细情况。</p> 
<p>他说：“如果你和他处不来可不要怪我。我只是在化验室里偶然碰到他，略微知道他一些；此外，对于他就一无所知了。既然你自己提议这么办，那么，就不要叫我负责了。”</p> 
<p>我回答说：“如果我们处不来，散伙也很容易。"我用眼睛盯着我的同伴接着说道，“斯坦弗，我看，你对这件事似乎要缩手不管了，其中一定有缘故。是不是这个人的起起真的那样可怕，还是有别的原因？不要这样吞吞吐吐的。”</p> 
<p>他笑了一笑说：“要把难以形容的事用言语表达出来可真不容易。我看福尔摩斯这个人有点太科学化了，几乎近于冷血的程度。我记得有一次，他拿一小撮植物碱给他的朋友尝尝。你要知道，这并不是出于什么恶意，只不过是出于一种钻研的动机，要想正确地了解这种药物的不同效果罢了。平心而论，我认为他自己也会一口把它吞下去的。看来他对于确切的知识有着强烈的爱好。”</p> 
<p>“这种精神也是对的呀。”</p> 
<p>“是的，不过也未免太过分了。后来他甚至在解剖室里用棍子抽打尸体，这毕竟是一件怪事吧。”</p> 
<p>“抽打尸体！”</p> 
<p>“是啊，他是为了证明人死以后还能造成什么样的伤痕。我亲眼看见过他抽打尸体。”</p> 
<p>“你不是说他不是学医的吗？”</p> 
<p>“是呀。天晓得他在研究些什么东西。现在咱们到了，他到底是怎么样一个人，你自己瞧吧。"他说着，我们就下了车，走进一条狭窄的胡同，从一个小小的旁门进去，来到一所大医院的侧楼。这是我所熟悉的地方，不用人领路我们就走上了白石台阶，穿过一条长长的走廊。走廊两壁刷得雪白，两旁有许多暗褐色的小门。靠着走廊尽头上有一个低低的拱形过道，从这里一直通往化验室。</p> 
<p>化验室是一间高大的屋子，四面杂乱地摆着无数的妻子。几张又矮又大的桌子纵横排列着，上边放着许多蒸馏瓶、试管和一些闪动着蓝色火焰的小小的本生灯。屋子里只有一个人，他坐在较远的一张桌子前边，伏在桌上聚精会神地工作着。他听到我们的脚步声，回过头来瞧了一眼，接着就跳了起来，高兴地欢呼着：“我发现了！我发现了！"他对我的同伴大声说着，一面手里拿着一个试管向我们跑来，“我发现了一种试剂，只能用血色蛋白质来沉淀，别的都不行。"即使他发现了金矿，也不见得会比现在显得更高兴。</p> 
<p>斯坦弗给我们介绍说：“这位是华生医生，这位是福尔摩斯先生。”</p> 
<p>“您好。"福尔摩斯热诚地说，一边使劲握住我的手。我简直不能相信他会有这样大的力气。</p> 
<p>“我看得出来，您到过阿富汗。”</p> 
<p>我吃惊地问道：“您怎么知道的？”</p> 
<p>“这没有什么，"他格格地笑了笑，“现在要谈的是血色蛋白质的问题。没有问题，您一定会看出我这发现的重要性了吧？”</p> 
<p>我回答说：“从化学上来说，无疑地这是很有意思的，但是在实用方面……”</p> 
<p>“怎么，先生，这是近年来实用法医学上最重大的发现了。难道您还看不出来这种试剂能使我们在鉴别血迹上百无一失吗？请到这边来！"他急忙拉住我的袖口，把我拖到他原来工作的那张桌子的前面。"咱们弄点鲜血，"他说着，用一根长针刺破自己的手指，再用一支吸管吸了那滴血。</p> 
<p>“现在把这一点儿鲜血放到一公升水里去。您看，这种混合液与清水无异。血在这种溶液中所占的成分还不到百万分之一。虽然如此，我确信咱们还是能够得到一种特定的反应。”说着他就把几粒白色结晶放进这个容器里，然后又加上几滴透明的液体。不一会儿，这溶液就现出暗红色了，一些棕色颗粒渐渐沉淀到瓶底上。</p> 
<p>“哈！哈！"他拍着手，象小孩子拿到新玩具似地那样兴高采烈地喊道，“您看怎么样？”</p> 
<p>我说：“看来这倒是一种非常精密的实验。”</p> 
<p>“妙极了！简直妙极了！过去用愈创木液试验的方法，既难作又不准确。用显微镜检验血球的方法也同样不好。如果血迹已干了几个钟头以后，再用显微镜来检验就不起作用了。现在，不论血迹新旧，这种新试剂看来都一样会发生作用。假如这个试验方法能早些发现，那么，现在世界上数以百计的逍遥法外的罪人早就受到法律的制裁了。”</p> 
<p>我喃喃地说道：“确是这样！”</p> 
<p>“许多刑事犯罪案件往往取决于这一点。也许罪行发生后几个月才能查出一个嫌疑犯。检查了他的衬衣或者其他衣物后，发现上面有褐色斑点。这些斑点究竟是血迹呢，还是泥迹，是铁锈还是果汁的痕迹呢，还是其他什么东西？这是一个使许多专家都感到为难的问题，可是为什么呢？就是因为没有可靠的检验方法。现在，我们有了歇洛克·福尔摩斯检验法，以后就不会有任何困难了。”</p> 
<p>他说话的时候，两眼显得炯炯有神。他把一只手按在胸前，鞠了一躬，好象是在对许多想象之中正在鼓掌的观众致谢似的。</p> 
<p>我看到他那兴奋的样子很觉惊破，我说：“我向你祝贺。”</p> 
<p>“去年在法兰克福地方发生过冯·彼少夫一案。如果当时就有这个检验方法的话，那么，他一定早就被绞死了。此外还有布莱德弗地方的梅森；臭名昭著的摩勒；茂姆培利耶的洛菲沃以及新奥尔良的赛姆森。我可以举出二十多个案件，在这些案件里，用这个方法都会起决定性的作用。”</p> 
<p>斯坦弗不禁大笑起来，他说：“你好象是犯罪案件的活字典。你真可以创办一份报纸，起名叫做'警务新闻旧录报'。”</p> 
<p>“读读这样的报纸一定很有趣味。"福尔摩斯一面把一小块橡皮膏贴在手指破口上，一面说，“我不得不小心一点，"他转过脸来对我笑了一笑，接着又说，“因为我常和毒起接触。”说着他就伸出手来给我看。只见他的手上几乎贴满了同样大小的橡皮膏，并且由于受到强酸的侵蚀，手也变了颜色。</p> 
<p>“我们到你这儿来有点事情，"斯坦弗说着就坐在一只三脚高凳上，并且用脚把另一只凳子向我这边推了一推，接着又说，“我这位朋友要找个住处，因为你正抱怨找不着人跟你合住，所以我想正好给你们两人介绍一下。”</p> 
<p>福尔摩斯听了要跟我合住，似乎感到很高兴，他说：“我看中了贝克街的一所公寓式的房子，对咱们两个人完全合适。但愿您不讨厌强烈的烟草气味。”</p> 
<p>我回答说：“我自己总是抽'船'牌烟的。”</p> 
<p>“那好极了。我常常搞一些化学药品，偶尔也做做试验，你不讨厌吗？”</p> 
<p>“决不会。”</p> 
<p>“让我想想——我还有什么别的缺点呢？有时我心情不好，一连几天不开口；在这种情形下，您不要以为我是生气了，但听我自然，不久就会好的。您也有什么缺点要说一说吗？两个人在同住以前，最好能够彼此先了解了解对方的最大缺点。”</p> 
<p>听到他这样追根问底，我不禁笑了起来。我说：“我养了一条小虎头狗。我的神经受过刺激，最怕吵闹。每天不定什么时候起床，并且非常懒。在我身体健壮的时候，我还有其他一些坏习惯，但是目前主要的缺点就是这些了。”</p> 
<p>他又急切地问道：“您把拉提琴也算在吵闹范围以内吗？”</p> 
<p>我回答说：“那要看拉提琴的人了。提琴拉得好，那真是象仙乐一般的动听，要是拉得不好的话……”</p> 
<p>福尔摩斯高兴地笑着说：“啊，那就好了。如果您对那所房子还满意的话，我想咱们可以认为这件事就算谈妥了。”</p> 
<p>“咱们什么时候去看看房子？”</p> 
<p>他回答说：“明天中午您先到这儿来找我，咱们再一起去，把一切事情都决定下来。”</p> 
<p>我握着他的手说：“好吧，明天中午准时见。”</p> 
<p>我们走的时候，他还在忙着做化学试验。我和斯坦弗便一起向我所住的公寓走去。</p> 
<p>“顺便问你一句，"我突然站住，转过脸来向斯坦弗说，“真见鬼，他怎么会知道我是从阿富汗回来的呢？”</p> 
<p>我的同伴意味深长地笑了笑，他说：“这就是他特别的地方。许多人都想要知道他究竟是怎么看出问题来的。”</p> 
<p>“咳，这不是很神秘吗？"我搓着两手说，“真有趣极了。我很感谢你把我们两人拉在一起。要知道，真是'研究人类最恰当的途径还是从具体的人着手'。”</p> 
<p>“嗯，你一定得研究研究他，"斯坦弗在和我告别的时候说，“但是你会发现，他真是个难以研究的人物。我敢担保，他了解你要比你了解他高明得多。再见吧！”</p> 
<p>我答了一声：“再见！"然后就慢步向着我的公寓走去，我觉得我新结识的这个�</p>    </div>  </div>  <div class="row">    <a class="col-xs-2" href="//血字的研究 A Study In Scarlet/book.html">Previous</a>    <a class="col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:center;" href="//血字的研究 A Study In Scarlet/book.html">Table</a>    <a class="col-xs-2 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:right;" href="//血字的研究 A Study In Scarlet/2.html"> Next</a>  </div>  <hr></div><hr><footer class="container">  <p>© Company 2014</p></footer><!-- jQuery (Bootstrap 的所有 JavaScript 插件都依赖 jQuery，所以必须放在前边) --><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@1.12.4/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><!-- 加载 Bootstrap 的所有 JavaScript 插件。你也可以根据需要只加载单个插件。 --><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@3.3.7/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script></body></html>
