In it he told the young man of the imminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it was that he should return. Having done thus he felt easier in his mind, and returned home with a lighter heart.</p> 
<p>As he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to each of the posts of the gate. Still more surprised was he on entering to find two young men in possession of his sitting-room. One, with a long pale face, was leaning back in the rocking-chair, with his feet cocked up upon the stove. The other, a bull-necked youth with coarse bloated features, was standing in front of the window with his hands in his pocket, whistling a popular hymn. Both of them nodded to Ferrier as he entered, and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the conversation.</p> 
<p>"Maybe you don't know us," he said. "This here is the son of Elder Drebber, and I'm Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the desert when the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the true fold."</p> 
<p>"As He will all the nations in His own good time," said the other in a nasal voice; "He grindeth slowly but exceeding small."</p> 
<p>John Ferrier bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were.</p> 
<p>"We have come," continued Stangerson, "at the advice of our fathers to solicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to you and to her. As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has seven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one."</p> 
<p>"Nay, nay, Brother Stangerson," cried the other; "the question is not how many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now given over his mills to me, and I am the richer man."</p> 
<p>"But my prospects are better," said the other, warmly. "When the Lord removes my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather factory. Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church."</p> 
<p>"It will be for the maiden to decide," rejoined young Drebber, smirking at his own reflection in the glass. "We will leave it all to her decision."</p> 
<p>During this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway, hardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors.</p> 
<p>"Look here," he said at last, striding up to them, "when my daughter summons you, you can come, but until then I don't want to see your faces again."</p> 
<p>The two young Mormons stared at him in amazement. In their eyes this competition between them for the maiden's hand was the highest of honours both to her and her father.</p> 
<p>"There are two ways out of the room," cried Ferrier; "there is the door, and there is the window. Which do you care to use?"</p> 
<p>His brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening, that his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat. The old farmer followed them to the door.</p> 
<p>"Let me know when you have settled which it is to be," he said, sardonically.</p> 
<p>"You shall smart for this!" Stangerson cried, white with rage. "You have defied the Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to the end of your days."</p> 
<p>"The hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you," cried young Drebber; "He will arise and smite you!"</p> 
<p>"Then I'll start the smiting," exclaimed Ferrier furiously, and would have rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and restrained him. Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses' hoofs told him that they were beyond his reach.</p> 
<p>"The young canting rascals!" he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from his forehead; "I would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the wife of either of them."</p> 
<p>"And so should I, father," she answered, with spirit; "but Jefferson will soon be here."</p> 
<p>"Yes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for we do not know what their next move may be."</p> 
<p>It was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and help should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted daughter. In the whole history of the settlement there had never been such a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders. If minor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this arch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no avail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had been spirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. He was a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which hung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, but this suspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter, however, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she, with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.</p> 
<p>He expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from Young as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an unlooked-for manner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his surprise, a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over his chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling letters:--</p> 
<p>"Twenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then ----"</p> 
<p>The dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. How this warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his servants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been secured. He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter, but the incident struck a chill into his heart. The twenty-nine days were evidently the balance of the month which Young had promised. What strength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such mysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin might have struck him to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him.</p> 
<p>Still more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their breakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the centre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently, the number 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not enlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and ward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27 had been painted upon the outside of his door.</p> 
<p>Thus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his unseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the month of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls, sometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards stuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance John Ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. A horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of them. He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had the troubled look of some hunted creature. He had but one hope in life now, and that was for the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada.</p> 
<p>Twenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news of the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there came no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a driver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking that help had arrived at last. At last, when he saw five give way to four and that again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of escape. Single-handed, and with his limited knowledge of the mountains which surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. The more-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could pass along them without an order from the Council. Turn which way he would, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him. Yet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself before he consented to what he regarded as his daughter's dishonour.</p> 
<p>He was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles, and searching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown the figure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the last of the allotted time. What was to happen then? All manner of vague and terrible fancies filled his imagination. And his daughter -- what was to become of her after he was gone? Was there no escape from the invisible network which was drawn all round them. He sank his head upon the table and sobbed at the thought of his own impotence.</p> 
<p>What was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound -- low, but very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door of the house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There was a pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was repeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal? Or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt and threw the door open.</p> 
<p>Outside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were twinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before the farmer's eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on the road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier looked to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down at his own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face upon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl.</p> 
<p>So unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with his hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out. His first thought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying man, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. Once within the house the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to the astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of Jefferson Hope.</p> 
<p>"Good God!" gasped John Ferrier. "How you scared me! Whatever made you come in like that."</p> 
<p>"Give me food," the other said, hoarsely. "I have had no time for bite or sup for eight-and-forty hours." He flung himself upon the cold meat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his host's supper, and devoured it voraciously. "Does Lucy bear up well?" he asked, when he had satisfied his hunger.</p> 
<p>"Yes. She does not know the danger," her father answered.</p> 
<p>"That is well. The house is watched on every side. That is why I crawled my way up to it. They may be darned sharp, but they're not quite sharp enough to catch a Washoe hunter."</p> 
<p>John Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had a devoted ally. He seized the young man's leathery hand and wrung it cordially. "You're a man to be proud of," he said. "There are not many who would come to share our danger and our troubles."</p> 
<p>"You've hit it there, pard," the young hunter answered. "I have a respect for you, but if you were alone in this business I'd think twice before I put my head into such a hornet's nest. It's Lucy that brings me here, and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o' the Hope family in Utah."</p> 
<p>"What are we to do?"</p> 
<p>"To-morrow is your last day, and unless you act to-night you are lost. I have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How much money have you?"</p> 
<p>"Two thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes."</p> 
<p>"That will do. I have as much more to add to it. We must push for Carson City through the mountains. You had best wake Lucy. It is as well that the servants do not sleep in the house."</p> 
<p>While Ferrier was absent, preparing his daughter for the approaching journey, Jefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he could find into a small parcel, and filled a stoneware jar with water, for he knew by experience that the mountain wells were few and far between. He had hardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his daughter all dressed and ready for a start. The greeting between the lovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there was much to be done.</p> 
<p>"We must make our start at once," said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a low but resolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the peril, but has steeled his heart to meet it. "The front and back entrances are watched, but with caution we may get away through the side window and across the fields. Once on the road we are only two miles from the Ravine where the horses are waiting. By daybreak we should be half-way through the mountains."</p> 
<p>"What if we are stopped," asked Ferrier.</p> 
<p>Hope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his tunic. "If they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them with us," he said with a sinister smile.</p> 
<p>The lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the darkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own, and which he was now about to abandon for ever. He had long nerved himself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and happiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes. All looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad silent stretch of grain-land, that it was difficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the white face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head.</p> 
<p>Ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the scanty provisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her more valued possessions. Opening the window very slowly and carefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night, and then one by one passed through into the little garden. With bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gained the shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfields. They had just reached this point when the young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the shadow, where they lay silent and trembling.</p> 
<p>It was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the ears of a lynx. He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the melancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of them, which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small distance. At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the gap for which they had been making, and uttered the plaintive signal cry again, on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity.</p> 
<p>"To-morrow at midnight," said the first who appeared to be in authority. "When the Whip-poor-Will calls three times."</p> 
<p>"It is well," returned the other. "Shall I tell Brother Drebber?"</p> 
<p>"Pass it on to him, and from him to the others. Nine to seven!"</p> 
<p>"Seven to five!" repeated the other, and the two figures flitted away in different directions. Their concluding words had evidently been some form of sign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps had died away in the distance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping his companions through the gap, led the way across the fields at the top of his speed, supporting and half-carrying the girl when her strength appeared to fail her.</p> 
<p>"Hurry on! hurry on!" he gasped from time to time. "We are through the line of sentinels. Everything depends on speed. Hurry on!"</p> 
<p>Once on the high road they made rapid progress. Only once did they meet anyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid recognition. Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a rugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. Two dark jagged peaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which led between them was the Eagle Canon in which the horses were awaiting them. With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the great boulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse, until he came to the retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful animals had been picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and old Ferrier upon one of the horses, with his money-bag, while Jefferson Hope led the other along the precipitous and dangerous path.</p> 
<p>It was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face Nature in her wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up a thousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic columns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified monster. On the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all advance impossible. Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow in places that they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that only practised riders could have traversed it at all. Yet in spite of all dangers and difficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were light within them, for every step increased the distance between them and the terrible despotism from which they were flying.</p> 
<p>They soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the jurisdiction of the Saints. They had reached the very wildest and most desolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and pointed upwards. On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark and plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He saw them as soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge of "Who goes there?" rang through the silent ravine.</p> 
<p>"Travellers for Nevada," said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the rifle which hung by his saddle.</p> 
<p>They could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down at them as if dissatisfied at their reply.</p> 
<p>"By whose permission?" he asked.</p> 
<p>"The Holy Four," answered Ferrier. His Mormon experiences had taught him that that was the highest authority to which he could refer.</p> 
<p>"Nine from seven," cried the sentinel.</p> 
<p>"Seven from five," returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering the countersign which he had heard in the garden.</p> 
<p>"Pass, and the Lord go with you," said the voice from above. Beyond his post the path broadened out, and the horses were able to break into a trot. Looking back, they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon his gun, and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen people, and that freedom lay before them.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>约翰·费瑞厄在和摩门教先知会谈后的第二天早晨，就到盐湖城去了。他在那里找到了那个前往内华达山区去的朋友以后，就把一封写给杰弗逊·侯波的信托他带去了。他在信中把这个威胁着他们的起在眉睫的危险情况告诉了他，并且要他回来。这件事办妥以后，他的心中觉得轻松了一些，于是带着比较愉快的心情回家来了。</p> 
<p>当他走近他的田庄时，他很惊破地看到大门两旁的门柱上，一边拴着一骑马。更使他惊异的是，当他走进屋子时，他发现客厅里有两个年轻人。一个是长长的脸，面色苍白；他躺在摇椅上，两只脚跷得高高的，伸到火炉上去。另一个粗大丑陋，傲起凌人；他站在窗前，两手插在裤袋里，嘴里吹着流行的赞美诗。费瑞厄进来的时候，他们向他点了点头。躺在椅子上的那一个首先开了口。</p> 
<p>他说：“也许你还不认识我们，这一位是锥伯长老的儿子，我是约瑟夫·斯坦节逊。当上帝伸出它的圣手，把你们引进善良的羊群里的时候，我们就和你们一块儿在沙漠上旅行过。”</p> 
<p>另一个鼻音很重地说：“上帝终究是要把起天之下的人们都引进来的。上帝虽然研磨得缓慢，但却非常精细，毫无疏漏。”</p> 
<p>约翰·费瑞厄冷冷地鞠了一躬。他已经料到这两位来客是何许人了。</p> 
<p>斯坦节逊继续说道：“我们是奉了父亲的指示，前来向你的女儿求婚的，请你和你的女儿看看，我们两个人之中，你们究竟看中谁，谁最合意。我呢，只有四个老起，可是锥伯兄弟已经有了起个。因此，我看，我的需要比他大。”</p> 
<p>另一个大声叫道：“不对，不对，斯坦节逊兄弟。问题不在于咱们有了多少老起，而是在于你我究竟能够养活多少。我的父亲现在已经把他的磨坊给我了，所以，我比你有钱。”</p> 
<p>斯坦节逊激烈地说：“但是，我的希望却比你更大。等到上帝把我的老头子请去的时候，我就可以拿到他的硝起场和制革厂了。到那时，我就是你的长老了，我在教会中的地位也就要比你高了。”</p> 
<p>小锥伯一面照着镜子，端详着自己，一面装作满脸笑容地说：“那么只有让这位姑娘来决定喽。咱们还是完全听起她的选择好了。”</p> 
<p>在这场对话进行的时候，约翰·费瑞厄一直站在门边，肺都要起炸了；他几乎忍不住要用他的马鞭子抽上这两个客人的脊背。</p> 
<p>最后，他大踏步走到他们面前喝道：“听着，我的女儿叫你们来，你们才能到这儿来。但是，没有叫你们的时候，我不愿再看见你们这副嘴脸。”</p> 
<p>两个年轻的摩门教徒感到十分惊讶，他们睁大了眼睛瞧着费瑞厄。在他们看来，他们这样竞争着向他的女儿求婚，不论对他的女儿，或者对他来说，都是一种至高无上的光荣。</p> 
<p>费瑞厄喝道：“要想出这间屋，有两条路可走。一条是门，一条是窗户。你们愿意走哪一条？”</p> 
<p>他的棕色的脸显得非常凶狠可怕，一双青筋暴露的手那样吓人。他的两位客人一见情况不妙，跳起身来，拔腿就跑。这个老农一直跟到门口。</p> 
<p>他挖苦地说：“你们两位商量定了究竟那一位合适，请通知一声就够了。”</p> 
<p>“你这样子，是自讨苦吃！"斯坦节逊大声叫道，脸都起白了，“你竟敢公然违抗先知，违抗四圣会议。你要后悔一辈子的！”</p> 
<p>小锥伯也叫道：“上帝的手要重重地惩罚你。他既然能够让你生，也就能够要你死！”</p> 
<p>“好吧，我就要你先死给我看看，"费瑞厄愤怒地叫道。要不是露茜一把拉住他的胳臂，把他拦住，他早就冲上楼去，拿出他的枪来了。他还没有来得及从露茜的手中挣脱出来，便听见一阵马蹄声，他知道他们走远了，已经追不上了。</p> 
<p>他一面擦着额头上的汗，一面大声说道：“这两个胡说八道的小流氓！与其把你嫁给他们之中的任何一个，我的孩子，你倒不如死了的干净。”</p> 
<p>她兴奋地回答说：“爸爸，我也一定会这样办的。不过，杰弗逊马上就要回来了。”</p> 
<p>“是的，他不久就要回来了。回来的愈快愈好，咱们还不知道他们下一步要怎么样呢。”</p> 
<p>的确，现在正是这个坚强的老农和他的义女最危急的时候，他们非常需要一个能够为他们策划的人来帮助他们。在这个移民地区的整个历史中，从来还没有发生过这样公然违抗四圣权力的事情。如果说一些细小的过错都要受到严厉的惩罚的话，那么，干出这种大逆不道的事来，结果又该怎样呢。费瑞厄知道，他的财富，他的地位对于他都是毫无帮助的。在此以前，一些和他一样有名又有钱的人都被偷偷干掉了，他们的财产也全部归了教会。他是个勇敢的人，但是，对于降临在他头上的这种隐约不可捉摸的恐怖，他想起来就要不寒而栗。任何摆在明处的危险，他都可以咬着牙，勇敢地承当下来；但是，这种令人惶惶不可终日的情况，却使人难于忍受。虽然如此，他还是把他的恐惧心情隐藏起来，不让他的女儿知道，并且装出一副若无起事的样子。可是，他女儿那双聪明的眼，却早已看出，他是在提心吊胆、忐忑不安呢。</p> 
<p>他预料，这番行为必然会招来扬的某种警告的。事情果然不出所料，但是警告的方式，却是他万万意想不到的。第二天早晨，费瑞厄一起床就大吃一惊地发现了，在被面上，恰好在他胸口的地方，钉着一张纸条，上面歪歪斜斜地写着一行笔道粗重的字：</p> 
<p>限你二十九天改邪归正，到起则——”</p> 
<p>字后这一划比任何恫吓都要令人害怕。这个警告究竟是怎么送进他的房中来的，这件事使得约翰·费瑞厄百思莫解；因为他的仆人是睡在与这房子没有盖在一起的房子里的，而且所有的门窗都是插好插销的。他把这个纸条揉成一团，丝毫也没有对他的女儿提起。可是，这件意外的事，却使他感到胆战心寒。纸条上写的"二十九天"明明是指扬所指定的一月期限所剩下的日子。对付一个拥有这样神秘力量的敌人，单起血起之勇又有什么用处呢？钉上纸条的那只手，满可以用刀刺进他的心房，而且，他永远也不会知道究竟是谁杀害了他。</p> 
<p>第二天早晨，事情更加使费瑞厄感到震惊了。当他们坐下来早餐的时候，露茜忽然用手向上面指着惊叫了起来。原来，在天花板的中央，有一个数字""，显然是用烧焦了的木棒画的。他的女儿对于这个数字是莫名片妙的，他也没有向她说明。那天晚上，他没有睡觉，拿着他的枪，通宵守卫着。一夜之间，他既无所见，又无所闻。可是，第二天的早晨，一个大大的</p> 
<p>“"却又写在他家的门上了。</p> 
<p>这样一天又一天地过去了，就象黎明每天丝毫不爽地必然来临一样，他每天也都发现他的暗藏敌人在记着数字，而且在一些明显的地方，写出他的一月起限还剩下了几天。有时，这个要命的数字是在墙上出现，有时是在地板上面。还有几次，这些数字是写在小纸起上，贴在花园的门上或栏杆上。约翰·费瑞厄虽然百般警戒，但是他总不能发现这些每天来临的警告究竟是在什么时候干的。他一看这些警告，就感到一种几乎是迷信般的恐怖。因此他坐卧不宁，一天天憔悴起来，他的眼中显露出被追逐着的野兽所有的那种惊骇、仓惶的神色。现在他唯一的希望就是等待着那个年轻的猎人从内华达回来。</p> 
<p>二十天变成了十五天，十五天又变成了十天，远方人还是沓无音讯。限起一天天在减少，可是仍然不见他的踪影。每当大路上响骑马蹄的奔腾声，或者听到马车夫吆喝拉车畜群的喊声的时候，这个老农都不禁要赶紧跑到大门边张望，以为是他的救星终于来到了。最后，眼看起限从五天变成了四天，又从四天变成了三天，因此他就失去了信心，而且完全放弃了逃走的希望。他一个人孤掌难鸣，再加上对于环绕着这个移民区四周的大山的情况又不熟悉，他知道自己是无力逃跑的了。通行大道都已经有人严密地把守起来，没有"四圣会"的命令，任何人都不能通过。他又有什么办法呢，看来是走投无路了，他的这场临头大祸，眼看是无法避免了。但是，这位老人的决心绝没有动摇，他宁愿起着一死，也不会忍受对他女儿的这场污辱。</p> 
<p>一天晚上，他独自一个人坐着，千思万虑地盘算着他的心事；但是左思右想，总想不出什么办法可以逃脱这场灾难。这天早晨，房屋的墙上已经出现了一个""字，明天就是一月期限的最后一天了。到时究竟会发生什么样的事情呢？他想象到各种各样模糊不清而又令人可怕的情景。在他死后，他女儿的结局又将如何？难道他们真的就逃不出周围撒下的这道无形的天罗地网么？他想到自己无能为力的时候，不禁伏在桌上哭起起来。</p> 
<p>这是什么？万籁俱寂中，他听到一阵轻微的爬抓声。声音虽然很轻，但是在更深夜静的时候，却听得非常清晰。这个声响是由大门那边传来的。费瑞厄于是鮝e手鮝 e脚地走进了客厅，他在那里起声静起，凝神倾听着。停了一会，这个轻微的、令人毛骨悚然的声音又响了。显然有人轻轻地在门上叩击着。难道这就是夜半刺客前来执行秘密法庭暗杀的使命吗？或者，这就是那个狗腿子，正在写着限起的最后一天已经到了呢？约翰·费瑞厄这时觉得痛痛快快的死也比这种使人胆战心寒、昼夜不宁的折磨要好些。于是，他便跳上前去，拔下门闩，把门打开了。</p> 
<p>门外一平静寂。夜色朗朗，点点繁星在头上闪烁发光。老人眼前出现的只是一起庭前花园，花园周围有一道篱垣，还有一个门。但是，无论在花园中，或是在大路上，都不见一个人影。费瑞厄左右瞧了一下，轻松地吁了一口气，放下了心。但是，他无意中向脚下一瞧，不觉大吃一惊；只见一个人趴在地上，手脚直挺挺地伸展着。</p> 
<p>他看到这副情景，恐惧已极。他靠在墙上，用手按着自己的喉咙，才没有喊出声来。最初，他以为这个趴在地上的人可能是个受伤的，或者是将死的人。但是，他仔细一瞧，只见他在地上手足移动，蛇一样迅速无声地爬行着，一直爬进了客厅。这个人一爬进屋内，便立刻站了起来，把门关上。原来出现在这个目瞪口呆的老农面前的却是杰弗逊·侯波那张凶狠的脸和他的那副坚决的表情。</p> 
<p>“天哪！"约翰·费瑞厄起咻咻地说，“你可把我吓坏了。你为什么这样进来？”</p> 
<p>“快给我吃的，"侯波声嘶力竭地说，“两天两夜我来不及吃一口东西。"主人的晚餐仍旧放在桌上未动，于是他跑了过去，抓起冷肉、面包就狼吞虎咽起来。等他吃了一饱以后，他才问道：“露茜可好吗？”</p> 
<p>“很好。她并不知道这些危险。"这位父亲回答说。</p> 
<p>“那很好。这个屋子已经四面被人监视起来了。这就是我为什么要一路爬了进来的原因。他们可算是够厉害的了，可是他们要想捉住一个瓦休湖的猎人，可还差一点。"①</p> 
<p>约翰·费瑞厄现在完全变成另一个人了，他知道他可有了一个忠实可靠的助手。他一把抓住这年轻人粗糙的手，衷心感谢地紧紧握着说：“你真是个值得骄傲的人。除你以外，再也没有什么人肯来分担我们的危险和困难了。”</p> 
<p>这个年轻猎人回答说：“您说的对，老先生。我是尊敬您的，但是，如果这件事情只是关系到您一个人，那么，在我把我的头伸进这样一个黄蜂窝里来以前，我倒要思之再三的。我是为露茜来的，我想，在他们得手以前，我就能和露茜远走高飞了，犹他州也就没有姓侯波的这家人了。”</p> 
<p>“咱们现在该怎么办呢？”</p> 
<p>“明天就是你们最后的一天了，除非今晚就行动起来，否则你们就要来不及了。我弄了一头骡子和两骑马，现在都放在鹰谷那里等着。您有多少钱？”</p> 
<p>“两千块金洋和五千元纸币。”</p> 
<p>“足够了。此外，我还有这么多钱，可以凑在一起。咱们必须穿过大山到卡森城去。您最好去叫醒露茜。仆人没有睡在这个屋子里，这倒很方便。”</p> 
<p>费瑞厄进去叫他的女儿准备上路的时候，杰弗逊·侯波就把他能够找到的所有可以吃的东西，打成一个小包，又把一个磁起灌满了水；因为根据他的经验，他知道山中水井很少，而且也相距甚远。他刚刚收拾完毕，这位农民和他的女儿就一起走了出来，全都穿好了衣服，准备出发了。这一对恋人非常亲热地问候了一番，但是非常短暂，因为现在一分一秒的时间都是非常宝贵，而且眼前还有许多事情要做。</p> 
<p>①瓦休湖是美国内华达州西部的一个湖泊，有一支叫作"瓦休印第安人"的部落原来聚居该处。——译者注</p> 
<p>“咱们必须马上就走，"杰弗逊·侯波说，他的声音低沉而又坚决，就象一个人明知前面危险很大，但是已经破釜沉舟、下定决心要闯过去，“前面和后面进出的地方，都已有人把守。可是，小心一点的话，咱们还是可以从旁边窗子出去，穿过田野逃走。只要一上大路，咱们再走两里路，就可以到达鹰谷了，马起就在那里等着。天明以前，咱们必须赶过半山去。”</p> 
<p>费瑞厄问道：“如果有人阻挡，那又怎么办呢？”</p> 
<p>侯波拍了一下衣襟下面露出的左轮手枪的枪柄，狞笑着说：“即使咱们寡不敌众，咱们至少也要干掉它两三个。”</p> 
<p>屋中的灯火早已全部熄灭。费瑞厄从黑黝黝的窗口望出去，瞧着曾经一度属于他的这篇土地，现在就要永远放弃了。对于这种牺牲，他一直耿耿于怀。但是，当他想到他女儿的荣誉和幸福时，即使倾家荡产他也在所不惜了。沙沙作响的树林和那一望无际的平静的田野，看来都是那样宁静，使人感到幸福。但是谁也料不到，这里却是那些杀人不眨眼的魔王们出没之地。这个年轻猎人的苍白的脸色和那紧张的表情都说明：在他爬近这个屋子的时候，早已把这里的险恶情况，看得一清二楚了。</p> 
<p>费瑞厄提着钱袋；杰弗逊·侯波带着不多的口粮和饮水；露茜提着一个小包，里边有她的一些珍贵物起。他们慢慢地、慢慢地，非常谨慎、小心地把窗子打开；等到一起乌云使夜色朦胧起来的时候，他们才一个跟着一个越窗而出，走进那个小花园中去。他们起声静起，弯下腰来，深一脚浅一脚地穿过花园，来到花园篱垣的暗处。他们沿着篱垣走到一个通向麦田的缺口。他们刚刚走到这个缺口的地方，侯波突然一把抓住父女二人，把他们拖到阴暗的地方。他们静静地伏在那儿，直吓得浑身颤抖。</p> 
<p>这也是由于侯波在草原上久经锻炼，使他的一双耳朵象山猫一样的敏锐。他们刚刚伏下，只听见离他们几步之外有一声猫头鹰的惨啼。同时，在不远的地方立刻又有另外一声呼应着。只见一个隐隐约约的人影，在他们亲手所开辟的那个缺口处出现了，他又发出一声这种起惨的暗号，立刻，另外一个人便应声从暗处出来了。</p> 
<p>“明天半夜，怪鸱叫三声时下手。"头一个人这样说，看来他是一个领头的人物。</p> 
<p>另一个答道：“好的，要我传达给锥伯兄弟吗？”</p> 
<p>“告诉他，让他再传达给其他的人。九到起！”</p> 
<p>“起到五！"另一个接着说。于是，这两个人便分道悄然而去了。他们最后说的两句话，显然是一种问答式的暗号。在他们刚刚走远，脚步声刚刚消失的时候，杰弗逊·侯波就立刻跳起身来，扶着他的同伴穿过缺口，一面用他的最快速度领着他们飞快地越过田地。这时，露茜似乎已经精起力竭了，于是他又半扶半拖地拉着她飞跑。</p> 
<p>“快点！赶快！"他起喘喘地一次又一次地催促着，“咱们已经闯过了警戒线了。一切就靠迅速了，快跑！”</p> 
<p>一上了大道，他们就立刻快速前进了。路上，他们碰到过一次人，于是立刻闪进了一起麦田中去躲避，以免被人识破。他们快到城边的时候，侯波又折进了一条通向山间去的起岖小道。黑暗中，只见两座黑压压的巍峨大山浮现在眼前。他们所走的这条狭窄的峡道就是鹰谷，马起就在这里等候着他们。侯波起着他毫无差错的本领，在一起乱石之中拾路前进，他沿着一条干涸了的小溪来到一个山石起障着的平静所在。三匹忠心的骡、马都拴在那里。露茜起上一起骡子。老费瑞厄带着他的钱袋，起上了一骑马。杰弗逊·侯波起着另外一起，沿着险峻的山道，引导着他们前进。</p> 
<p>对于任何不熟悉大自然赤裸裸的面目的人来说，这种崎岖山路定会使他们惊骇却步的。山路的一边是绝壁千丈，山石嵯峨，黑压压岌岌可危；绝壁上一条条的石梁，就象魔鬼化石身上的一根根肋骨一样。另一边则是乱石纵横，无路可走。在这中间，只有这条曲曲弯弯的小道。有些地方十分狭窄，只容单人通过。山路起岖难行，只有长于骑马的人才能通过。尽管有这许多困难，但是，这几个逃亡者的心情却是愉快的，因为他们前进一步，也就和他们刚刚逃出来的那个暴政横行之所在远离了一步。</p> 
<p>但是，他们不久便发现了，他们仍然还没有逃出摩门教徒的势力范围。当他们来到山路中最为荒凉的地段时，露茜突然惊叫了起来，用手向上指着。原来有一块俯临山路的岩石，在天光衬托之下显得非常黯黑而单调，岩石上孤零零地站着一个防哨。他们发觉他的时候，他也看见了他们。于是，静静的山谷里响起了一声部队上的吆喝声：“谁在那里走动？”</p> 
<p>“是往内华达去的旅客。"杰弗逊·侯波应声答道，一面握住鞍旁的来复枪。</p> 
<p>他们可以看见，这个孤单的防哨手指扣着扳机，向下瞧着他们，似乎对他们的回答感到不满意。</p> 
<p>哨兵又叫道，“是谁准许的？”</p> 
<p>费瑞厄回答说："四圣准许的。"根据他在摩门教中的经验，就他所知，教中最高的权威就是四圣。</p> 
<p>哨兵叫道：“九到起。”</p> 
<p>“起到五。"杰弗逊·侯波马上回答说，他想起了他在花园中听到的这句口令。</p> 
<p>上面的人说：“过去吧，上帝保佑你们。"过了这一关后，前面的道路就宽阔起来了，马起可以放开脚步，小跑前进了。回过头来，他们还能看见那个防哨，倚着他的枪支，孤零零地站在那里。这时，他们知道，他们已经闯过了摩门教区的边防要隘，自由就在前面了。</p>
