"I guess you're going to take me to the police-station," he remarked to Sherlock Holmes. "My cab's at the door. If you'll loose my legs I'll walk down to it. I'm not so light to lift as I used to be."</p> 
<p>Gregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this proposition rather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner at his word, and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ankles. He rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure himself that they were free once more. I remember that I thought to myself, as I eyed him, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man; and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was as formidable as his personal strength.</p> 
<p>"If there's a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you are the man for it," he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at my fellow-lodger. "The way you kept on my trail was a caution."</p> 
<p>"You had better come with me," said Holmes to the two detectives.</p> 
<p>"I can drive you," said Lestrade.</p> 
<p>"Good! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have taken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us."</p> 
<p>I assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made no attempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his, and we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the horse, and brought us in a very short time to our destination. We were ushered into a small chamber where a police Inspector noted down our prisoner's name and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged. The official was a white-faced unemotional man, who went through his duties in a dull mechanical way. "The prisoner will be put before the magistrates in the course of the week," he said; "in the mean time, Mr. Jefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say? I must warn you that your words will be taken down, and may be used against you."</p> 
<p>"I've got a good deal to say," our prisoner said slowly. "I want to tell you gentlemen all about it."</p> 
<p>"Hadn't you better reserve that for your trial?" asked the Inspector.</p> 
<p>"I may never be tried," he answered. "You needn't look startled. It isn't suicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?" He turned his fierce dark eyes upon me as he asked this last question.</p> 
<p>"Yes; I am," I answered.</p> 
<p>"Then put your hand here," he said, with a smile, motioning with his manacled wrists towards his chest.</p> 
<p>I did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing and commotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest seemed to thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerful engine was at work. In the silence of the room I could hear a dull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source.</p> 
<p>"Why," I cried, "you have an aortic aneurism!"</p> 
<p>"That's what they call it," he said, placidly. "I went to a Doctor last week about it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before many days passed. It has been getting worse for years. I got it from over-exposure and under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. I've done my work now, and I don't care how soon I go, but I should like to leave some account of the business behind me. I don't want to be remembered as a common cut-throat."</p> 
<p>The Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the advisability of allowing him to tell his story.</p> 
<p>"Do you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?" the former asked.</p> 
<p>"Most certainly there is," I answered.</p> 
<p>"In that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to take his statement," said the Inspector. "You are at liberty, sir, to give your account, which I again warn you will be taken down."</p> 
<p>"I'll sit down, with your leave," the prisoner said, suiting the action to the word. "This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and the tussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters. I'm on the brink of the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. Every word I say is the absolute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to me."</p> 
<p>With these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began the following remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical manner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough. I can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I have had access to Lestrade's note-book, in which the prisoner's words were taken down exactly as they were uttered.</p> 
<p>"It don't much matter to you why I hated these men," he said; "it's enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings -- a father and a daughter -- and that they had, therefore, forfeited their own lives. After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime, it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court. I knew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should be judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into one. You'd have done the same, if you have any manhood in you, if you had been in my place.</p> 
<p>"That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago. She was forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart over it. I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed that his dying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his last thoughts should be of the crime for which he was punished. I have carried it about with me, and have followed him and his accomplice over two continents until I caught them. They thought to tire me out, but they could not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is likely enough, I die knowing that my work in this world is done, and well done. They have perished, and by my hand. There is nothing left for me to hope for, or to desire.</p> 
<p>"They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me to follow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I found that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving and riding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a cabowner's office, and soon got employment. I was to bring a certain sum a week to the owner, and whatever was over that I might keep for myself. There was seldom much over, but I managed to scrape along somehow. The hardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that of all the mazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most confusing. I had a map beside me though, and when once I had spotted the principal hotels and stations, I got on pretty well.</p> 
<p>"It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were living; but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across them. They were at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other side of the river. When once I found them out I knew that I had them at my mercy. I had grown my beard, and there was no chance of their recognizing me. I would dog them and follow them until I saw my opportunity. I was determined that they should not escape me again.</p> 
<p>"They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about London, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my cab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they could not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or late at night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behind hand with my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted.</p> 
<p>"They were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was some chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone, and never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them every day, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half the time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I watched them late and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but I was not discouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost come. My only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon and leave my work undone.</p> 
<p>"At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the street was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to their door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a time Drebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up my horse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for I feared that they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston Station they got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on to the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train, and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for some hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Drebber was rather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in the bustle that I could hear every word that passed between them. Drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do, and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated with him, and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that the matter was a delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not catch what Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that he must not presume to dictate to him. On that the Secretary gave it up as a bad job, and simply bargained with him that if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at Halliday's Private Hotel; to which Drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven, and made his way out of the station.</p> 
<p>"The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my enemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue precipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes him, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. It chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage. It was claimed that same evening, and returned; but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate constructed. By means of this I had access to at least one spot in this great city where I could rely upon being free from interruption. How to get Drebber to that house was the difficult problem which I had now to solve.</p> 
<p>"He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops, staying for nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out he staggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was a hansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way. We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets, until, to my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the Terrace in which he had boarded. I could not imagine what his intention was in returning there; but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from the house. He entered it, and his hansom drove away. Give me a glass of water, if you please. My mouth gets dry with the talking."</p> 
<p>I handed him the glass, and he drank it down.</p> 
<p>"That's better," he said. "Well, I waited for a quarter of an hour, or more, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside the house. Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared, one of whom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap whom I had never seen before. This fellow had Drebber by the collar, and when they came to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half across the road. `You hound,' he cried, shaking his stick at him; `I'll teach you to insult an honest girl!' He was so hot that I think he would have thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur staggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him. He ran as far as the corner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me and jumped in. `Drive me to Halliday's Private Hotel,' said he.</p> 
<p>"When I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy that I feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I drove along slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I might take him right out into the country, and there in some deserted lane have my last interview with him. I had almost decided upon this, when he solved the problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him again, and he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in, leaving word that I should wait for him. There he remained until closing time, and when he came out he was so far gone that I knew the game was in my own hands.</p> 
<p>"Don't imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would only have been rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring myself to do it. I had long determined that he should have a show for his life if he chose to take advantage of it. Among the many billets which I have filled in America during my wandering life, I was once janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at York College. One day the professor was lecturing on poisons, and he showed his students some alkaloid, as he called it, which he had extracted from some South American arrow poison, and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant death. I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and when they were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it. I was a fairly good dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble pills, and each pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison. I determined at the time that when I had my chance, my gentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these boxes, while I ate the pill that remained. It would be quite as deadly, and a good deal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief. From that day I had always my pill boxes about with me, and the time had now come when I was to use them.</p> 
<p>"It was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard and raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad within -- so glad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation. If any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty long years, and then suddenly found it within your reach, you would understand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and puffed at it to steady my nerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples throbbing with excitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as plain as I see you all in this room. All the way they were ahead of me, one on each side of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton Road.</p> 
<p>"There was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the dripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber all huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm, `It's time to get out,' I said.</p> 
<p>"`All right, cabby,' said he.</p> 
<p>"I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned, for he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden. I had to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little top-heavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into the front room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and the daughter were walking in front of us.</p> 
<p>"`It's infernally dark,' said he, stamping about.</p> 
<p>"`We'll soon have a light,' I said, striking a match and putting it to a wax candle which I had brought with me. `Now, Enoch Drebber,' I continued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, `who am I?'</p> 
<p>"He gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I saw a horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which showed me that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face, and I saw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered in his head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the door and laughed loud and long. I had always known that vengeance would be sweet, but I had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me.</p> 
<p>"`You dog!' I said; `I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St. Petersburg, and you have always escaped me. Now, at last your wanderings have come to an end, for either you or I shall never see to-morrow's sun rise.' He shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I could see on his face that he thought I was mad. So I was for the time. The pulses in my temples beat like sledge-hammers, and I believe I would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me.</p> 
<p>"`What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?' I cried, locking the door, and shaking the key in his face. `Punishment has been slow in coming, but it has overtaken you at last.' I saw his coward lips tremble as I spoke. He would have begged for his life, but he knew well that it was useless.</p> 
<p>"`Would you murder me?' he stammered.</p> 
<p>"`There is no murder,' I answered. `Who talks of murdering a mad dog? What mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from her slaughtered father, and bore her away to your accursed and shameless harem.'</p> 
<p>"`It was not I who killed her father,' he cried.</p> 
<p>"`But it was you who broke her innocent heart,' I shrieked, thrusting the box before him. `Let the high God judge between us. Choose and eat. There is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what you leave. Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are ruled by chance.'</p> 
<p>"He cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my knife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I swallowed the other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or more, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die. Shall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the first warning pangs told him that the poison was in his system? I laughed as I saw it, and held Lucy's marriage ring in front of his eyes. It was but for a moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid. A spasm of pain contorted his features; he threw his hands out in front of him, staggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the floor. I turned him over with my foot, and placed my hand upon his heart. There was no movement. He was dead!</p> 
<p>"The blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice of it. I don't know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the wall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police upon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and cheerful. I remembered a German being found in New York with RACHE written up above him, and it was argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must have done it. I guessed that what puzzled the New Yorkers would puzzle the Londoners, so I dipped my finger in my own blood and printed it on a convenient place on the wall. Then I walked down to my cab and found that there was nobody about, and that the night was still very wild. I had driven some distance when I put my hand into the pocket in which I usually kept Lucy's ring, and found that it was not there. I was thunderstruck at this, for it was the only memento that I had of her. Thinking that I might have dropped it when I stooped over Drebber's body, I drove back, and leaving my cab in a side street, I went boldly up to the house -- for I was ready to dare anything rather than lose the ring. When I arrived there, I walked right into the arms of a police-officer who was coming out, and only managed to disarm his suspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk.</p> 
<p>"That was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. All I had to do then was to do as much for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferrier's debt. I knew that he was staying at Halliday's Private Hotel, and I hung about all day, but he never came out. I fancy that he suspected something when Drebber failed to put in an appearance. He was cunning, was Stangerson, and always on his guard. If he thought he could keep me off by staying indoors he was very much mistaken. I soon found out which was the window of his bedroom, and early next morning I took advantage of some ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel, and so made my way into his room in the grey of the dawn. I woke him up and told him that the hour had come when he was to answer for the life he had taken so long before. I described Drebber's death to him, and I gave him the same choice of the poisoned pills. Instead of grasping at the chance of safety which that offered him, he sprang from his bed and flew at my throat. In self-defence I stabbed him to the heart. It would have been the same in any case, for Providence would never have allowed his guilty hand to pick out anything but the poison.</p> 
<p>"I have little more to say, and it's as well, for I am about done up. I went on cabbing it for a day or so, intending to keep at it until I could save enough to take me back to America. I was standing in the yard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called Jefferson Hope, and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221B, Baker Street. I went round, suspecting no harm, and the next thing I knew, this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists, and as neatly shackled as ever I saw in my life. That's the whole of my story, gentlemen. You may consider me to be a murderer; but I hold that I am just as much an officer of justice as you are."</p> 
<p>So thrilling had the man's narrative been, and his manner was so impressive that we had sat silent and absorbed. Even the professional detectives, _blase_ as they were in every detail of crime, appeared to be keenly interested in the man's story. When he finished we sat for some minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching of Lestrade's pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthand account.</p> 
<p>"There is only one point on which I should like a little more information," Sherlock Holmes said at last. "Who was your accomplice who came for the ring which I advertised?"</p> 
<p>The prisoner winked at my friend jocosely. "I can tell my own secrets," he said, "but I don't get other people into trouble. I saw your advertisement, and I thought it might be a plant, or it might be the ring which I wanted. My friend volunteered to go and see. I think you'll own he did it smartly."</p> 
<p>"Not a doubt of that," said Holmes heartily.</p> 
<p>"Now, gentlemen," the Inspector remarked gravely, "the forms of the law must be complied with. On Thursday the prisoner will be brought before the magistrates, and your attendance will be required. Until then I will be responsible for him." He rang the bell as he spoke, and Jefferson Hope was led off by a couple of warders, while my friend and I made our way out of the Station and took a cab back to Baker Street.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>我们的罪犯疯狂的抵抗显然并不是对于我们每个人有什么恶意，因为当他发觉他已无能为力的时候，便温顺地微笑起来，并且表示，希望在他挣扎的时候，没有伤害我们之中的任何一个。他对福尔摩斯说：“我想，你是要把我送到警察局去的。我的马车就在门外。如果你们把我的腿松开，我可以自己走下去上车。我可不是象从前那样那么容易被抬起来的。”</p> 
<p>葛莱森和雷斯垂德交换了一下眼色，似乎认为这种要求太大胆了些。但是，福尔摩斯却立刻接受了这个罪犯的要求，把我们在他脚腕上捆扎着的毛巾解开了。他站了起来，把两条腿舒展了一下，象是要证明一下，它们确实又获得了自由似的。我现在还记得，当时我瞧着他的时候，一面心中暗想，我很少见到过比他更为魁伟强壮的人了。饱经风霜的黑脸上表现出的那种坚决而有活力的神情，就象他的体力一样地令人惊异和不可忽视。</p> 
<p>他注视着我的同伴，带着衷心钦佩的神气说：“如果警察局长职位有空缺的话，我认为你是最合适的人选了。你对于我这个案子的侦查方法，确实是十分谨慎周密的。”</p> 
<p>福尔摩斯对那两个侦探说道："你们最好和我一块儿去吧。”</p> 
<p>雷斯垂德说：“我来给你们赶车。”</p> 
<p>“好的，那么葛莱森可以和我们坐上车去。还有你，医生。你对于这个案子已经发生了兴趣，最好也和我们一块走一遭吧。”</p> 
<p>我欣然同意了，于是我们就一同下了楼。我们的罪犯没有一点逃跑的企图，他安安静静地走进那个原来是他的马车里去，我们也跟着上了车。雷斯垂德爬上了车夫的座位，扬鞭催马前进，不久，便把我们拉到了目的地。我们被引进了一间小屋，那里有一个警官把我们罪犯的姓名以及他被控杀死的两个人的姓名都记录了下来。这个警官是个面色白皙、神情冷淡的人，他机械而呆板地履行了他的职务。他说：“犯人将在本周内提交法庭审讯。杰弗逊·侯波先生，你在审讯之前，还有什么话要说吗？但是我必须事先告诉你，你所说的话都要记录下来，并且可能用来作为定罪的根据的。”</p> 
<p>我们的罪犯慢慢地说道：“诸位先生，我有许多话要说，我愿意把它原原本本地都告诉你们。”</p> 
<p>这个警官问道：“你等到审讯时再说不更好吗？”</p> 
<p>他回答说：“我也许永远不会受到审讯了呢，你们不要大惊小怪，我并不是想要自杀。你是一位医生么？"他说这句话时，一面把他的凶悍而黧黑的眼睛转过来瞧着我。</p> 
<p>我说：“是的，我是医生。”</p> 
<p>“那么，请你用手按一个这里。"他说时微笑了一下，一面用他被铐着的手，指了一下胸口。</p> 
<p>我用手按按他的胸部，立刻觉察到里边有一种不同寻常的跳动。他的胸腔微微震动，就象在一座不坚固的建筑中，开动了一架强力的机平时的情形一样。在这静静的屋中，我能够听到他的胸膛里面有一阵轻微的噪杂声音。</p> 
<p>我叫道：“怎么，你得了动脉血瘤症！”</p> 
<p>他平静地说：“他们都这样说。上个星期，我找了一位医生瞧过，他对我说，过不了多少天，血瘤就要破裂。这个病已经好多年了，一年比一年坏起来。这个病，是我在盐湖城大山之中，由于饱经风霜，过度操劳，而且又吃不饱的缘故所引起的，现在我已经完成了我的工作，什么时候死，我都不在乎了。但是，我愿意在死以前，把这件事交代明白，死后好有个记载。我不愿在我死后让别人把我看成是一个寻常的杀人犯。”</p> 
<p>警官和两个侦探匆忙地商量了一下，考虑准许他说出他的经历来是否适当。</p> 
<p>警官问道：“医生，你认为他的病情确实有突然变化的危险吗？”</p> 
<p>我回答说：“确是这样。”</p> 
<p>这位警官于是说道：“如果是这样的话，为了维护法律起见，显然，我们的职责是首先取得他的口供。先生，你现在可以自由交代了。不过，我再一次告诉你，你所交代的都要记录下来的。”</p> 
<p>“请允许我坐下来讲吧。"犯人一面说，一面就不客气地坐了下来，“我的这个血瘤症很容易使我感到疲乏，何况半个钟头以前，我们斗争了一番，这绝不会使病情有所改进。我已经是坟墓边上的人了，所以我是不会对你们说谎的。我所说的每一句话，都是千真万确的。至于你们究竟如何处置，这对我来说，就无关紧要了。”</p> 
<p>杰弗逊·侯波说完这些话以后，就靠在椅背上，开始说出了下面这篇惊人的供词。他叙述时的态度从容不起，并且讲得有条有理，好象他所说的事情十分平淡无破。我可以保证，这起补充供词完全正确无误，因为这是我乘机从雷斯垂德的笔记本上抄录下来的。他是在他的笔记本中，把这个罪犯的供词按照他原来的说法，逐字逐句地记录了下来的。</p> 
<p>他说：“我为什么要恨这两个人，这一点对于你们说来，是无关紧要的。他们恶贯满盈，他们犯了罪，害死过两个人——一个父亲和一个女儿，因此他们付出了他们自己的性命，这也是罪有应得的。从他们犯罪以来，时间已经隔了这么久，我也不可能提出什么罪证，到任何一个法庭上去控告他们了。可是，我知道他们有罪，我打定主意，我要把法官、陪审员和行刑的刽子手的任务全部由我一个人担当票来。如果你们是男子汉大丈夫，如果你们站在我的地位上，你们一定也会象我这样干的。</p> 
<p>“我刚才说到的那个姑娘，二十年前她本来是要嫁给我的，可是她却被迫嫁给了这个锥伯，以致使她含恨而死。我从她遗体的手指上把这个结婚指环取了下来，当时我就发过誓，我一定要让锥伯瞧着这只指环毙命；还要在他临死的时刻，让他认识到，是由于自己所干的罪恶，才受到了惩罚。我万里迢迢地踏遍了两大洲，追踪着锥伯和他的帮凶，一直到我追上了他们为止，这只戒指都一直带在身边。他们打算东奔西跑，把我拖垮；但是，他们是枉费心机。即使我明天就死——这是很有可能的，但是在我临死的时候，我总算知道了：我在这个世界上的工作已经完成了，而且是出色地完成了。他们两个人已经死了，而且都是被我亲手杀死的，此外，我就再也没有什么别的希望和要求了。</p> 
<p>“他们是有钱的人，而我却是一个穷光蛋。因此，我要到处追赶他们，这件事对我说来并不容易。当我来到伦敦城的时候，我已经差不多是囊空如洗了。当时我发觉，我必须找个工作，维持我的生活。赶车、骑马对我来说，就是象走路一样的平常。于是我就到一家马车厂去找点工作，立刻就成功了。每个星期我要向车主缴纳一定数目的租金，剩下的就归我自己所有。但是，剩余的钱并不多，可是我总是设法勉强维持下去。最困难的事情是不认识道路。我认为在所有道路复杂的城市中，再没有比伦敦城的街道更复杂难认的了。我就在身旁带上一张地图；直到我熟悉了一些大旅馆和几个主要车站以后，我的工作才干得顺利起来。</p> 
<p>“过了好久，我才找到这两位先生居住的地方。我东查西问，直到最后我在无意之中碰上了他们。他们住在泰晤士河对岸坎伯韦尔地方的一家公寓里。只要我找到了他们，我知道，他们就算落在我的掌握之中了，我已经蓄了胡须，他们不可能认出我来。我紧紧地跟着他们，待机下手。我下定决心，这一次绝不能再让他们逃脱。</p> 
<p>“虽然如此，他们还是几乎又溜掉了。他们在伦敦走到哪儿，我就形影不离地跟到哪里。有时我赶着马车跟在他们后边，有时步行着。然而赶着马车却是最好的办法，因为这样他们就无法摆脱我了。只有在清晨或者在深夜我才做点生意，赚点钱，可是这样一来我就不能及时向车主缴纳租金了。但是，只要我能够亲手杀死仇人，别的我都不管了。</p> 
<p>“但是，他们非常狡猾。他们一定也意识到，可能有人会追踪他们，因此他们决不单独外出，也绝不在晚间出去。两个星起以来，我每天赶着马车跟在他们后面，可是我一次也没有看见他们分开过。锥伯经常是喝得醉醺醺的，但是，斯坦节逊却从来毫不疏忽。我起早摸黑地窥伺着他们，可是总遇不到机会。但是，我并没有因此而灰心失望，因为我总感觉到，报仇的时刻就要来到了。我唯一担心的却是我胸口里的这个毛病，说不定它会过早地破裂，使我的报仇大事功亏一篑。</p> 
<p>“最后，一天傍晚，当我赶着马车在他们所住的那条叫做陶尔魁里的地方徘徊的时候，我忽然看见一辆马车赶到他们住处的门前。立刻，有人把一些行李拿了出来，不久，锥伯和斯坦节逊也跟着出来，他们一同上车而去。我赶紧催马加鞭跟了上去，远远地跟在他们后边。当时我感到非常不安，唯恐他们又要改变住处。他们到了尤斯顿车站，下了马车。我找了一个小孩替我拉住我的马，我就跟着他们走进了月台。我听到他们打听去利物浦的火车；站上的人回答说，有一班车刚刚开出，几个钟头以内不会再有第二班车了，斯坦节逊听了以后，似乎很懊恼，可是锥伯却比什么都要高兴。我夹杂在人群之中，离他们非常近，所以我可以听到他们之间每一句谈话。锥伯说，他有一点私事要去办一下，如果斯坦节逊愿意等他一下的话，他马上就会回来。他的伙伴却拦阻他，并且提醒他说，他们曾经决定过彼此要在一起，不要单独行动。锥伯回答说，这是一件微妙的事，他必须独自去。我听不清斯坦节逊又说了些什么，后来只听见锥伯破口大骂，并且说，他不过是他雇用的仆役罢了，不要装腔作势地反而指责其他来。这样一来，这位秘书先生讨了一场没趣，只好不再多说，他只是和他商量，万一他耽误了最后的一班火车，可以到郝黎代旅馆去找他。锥伯回答说，他在十一点钟以前就可以回到月台上来；然后，他就一直走出了车站。</p> 
<p>“我日夜等待的千载难逢的时刻终于来到了。我的仇人已在我的掌握之中。他们在一起的时候，可以彼此相助；但是，一旦分开以后，他们就要落到我的掌握之中了。虽然如此，我并没有卤莽从事。我早已定下了一套计划：报仇的时刻，如果不让仇人有机会明白究竟是谁杀死了他；如果不让他明白为什么要受到这种惩罚；那么，这种复仇是不能令人称心满意的。我的报仇计划早就安排妥当，根据这个计划，我要让害苦了我的人有机会能够明白，现在是他恶贯满盈的时候了。恰巧，几天以前有一个坐我的车子在布瑞克斯顿路一带查看几处房屋的人，把其中一处的钥匙遗落在我的车里了。他虽然当天晚上就把这个钥匙领了回去，但是，在取走以前，我早就把它弄下了一个模子，而且照样配制了一把。这样一来，在这个大城市中，我至少找到一个可靠的地方，可以自由自在地干我的事情，而不致受到阻碍。现在要解决的困难问题就是如何把锥伯弄到那个房屋中去了。</p> 
<p>“他在路上走着，并且走进一两家酒店中去。他在最后一家酒店中，几乎停留了半个钟头。他出来的时候，已是步履蹒跚，显然他已醉得够劲了。在我的前面恰好有一辆双轮小马车，于是他就招呼着坐了上去。我一路紧紧地跟着。我的马的鼻子距离前面马车的车夫的身体最多只有一码远。我们经①过了滑铁卢大桥，在大街上跑了好几英里路。可是，使我感到诧异的是，我们竟然又回到了他原来居住的地方。我想象不出，他回到那里去究竟是想干些什么。但是，我还是跟了下去，在距离这所房屋大约一百码的地方，我便把车子停了下来。他走进了这座房子，他的马车也就走开了。请给我一杯水，我的嘴都说干了。”</p> 
<p>我递给他一杯水，他一饮而尽。</p> 
<p>他说：“这就好些了。好，我等了一刻钟，或者还要久一点，突然房子里面传来一阵打架似的吵闹声。接着，大门忽然大开，出现了两个人，其中一个就是锥伯，另一个是个年轻的小伙子，这个人我以前从来没有见到过。这个小伙子一把抓住锥伯的衣领，当他们走到台阶边的时候，他便用力一推，紧跟着又是一脚，把锥伯一直踹到了大街当中。他对着锥伯摇晃着手中的木棍大声喝道：‘狗东西！我教训教训你，你竟敢污辱良家妇女！'他是那样的怒不可遏，要不是这个坏蛋拖着两条腿拚命地向街中逃去，我想，那小伙子一定要用棍子把他痛打一顿呢。锥伯一直跑到转弯的地方，正好看见了我的马车，于是招呼着我，一脚就跳上车来。他说：‘把我送到郝黎代旅馆去。”</p> 
<p>“我一见他坐进了我的马车，简直喜出望外，我的心跳动得非常厉害。我深怕就在这个千钧一发的当儿，我的血瘤要迸裂了。我慢慢地赶着马车往前走，心中盘算着究竟该怎么办才妥善。我满可以把他一直拉到乡间去，在那荒凉无人的小路上，和他算一次总帐。我几乎已经决定这么办的时候，他忽然替我解决了这个难题。这时，他的酒瘾又发作了，他叫我在一家大酒店外面停下来。他一面吩咐我等着他，一面走了进去。他在里面一直呆到酒店收市，等出来的时候，他已经是烂醉如泥了，我知道，我已是胜券在握了。</p> 
<p>①当时双轮马车的车夫坐在车的最后面。——译者注</p> 
<p>“你们不要以为我会冷不防一刀，把他结果就算了事。如果这样做，只不过是死板板地执行严正的审判而已。但是，我不会那样干的。我早已决定给他一个机会，如果他能把握住这个机会的话，他还可以有一线生机。当我在美洲流浪的那些日子里，我干过各种各样的差事。我曾经一度做过'约克学院'实验室的看门人和扫地工友。有一天，教授正在讲解毒药问题时，他把一种叫做生物硷的东西给学生们看。这是他从一种南美洲土人制造毒箭的毒药中提炼出来的。这种毒药毒性非常猛烈，只要沾着一点儿，立刻就能致人死命。我记住了那个放毒药品子的所在，在他们走了以后，我就倒了一点出来。我是一个相当高明的配药能手，于是，我就把这些毒药做成了一些易于溶解的小丸。我在每个盒子里装进一粒，同时再放进一粒样子相同但是无毒的。我当时决定，只要一旦我能得手，这两位先生就要每人分得一盒，让他们每个人先吞服一粒，剩下的一粒就由我来吞服。这样做，和枪口蒙上手帕射击一样，可以置人于死地，而且还没有响声。从那一天气，我就一直把这些装着药丸的盒子带在身边；现在到了我使用它们的时候了。</p> 
<p>“当时已经是午夜过后，快一点钟的光景。这是一个起风苦雨的深夜。风刮得很厉害，大雨倾盆而下。外面虽然是一惨淡的景象，可是我的心里却是乐不可言，我高兴得几乎要大声欢叫起来。诸位先生，如果你们之中哪一位曾经为着一件事朝思暮想，一直盼望了二十多年，一旦伸手可得，那么，你们就会理解到我当时的心情了。我点燃了一支雪茄，喷着烟雾，借此安定我的紧张情绪。可是由于过分激动，我的手不住地在战抖，太阳穴也突突地乱跳。当我赶着马车前进时，我看见老约翰·费瑞厄和可爱的露茜在黑暗中瞧着我微笑。我看得清清楚楚，就象我现在在这间屋子里看见你们诸位一样。一路之上，他们总是在我的前面，一边一个地走在马的两旁，一直跟我来到布瑞克斯顿路的那所空宅。</p> 
<p>“到处看不见一个人影，除了淅沥的雨声之外听不到一点声音。我从车窗向车里一瞧，只见锥伯蜷缩成一团，因酒醉而沉入梦乡。我摇撼着他的臂膀说：‘该下车了。”</p> 
<p>“他说：‘好的，车夫。”</p> 
<p>“我想，他以为已经到了他刚才提到的那个旅馆，因为他别的什么话也没有说，就走下车来，跟着我走进了空屋前的花园。这时，他还有点头重脚轻，站立不稳。我不得不扶着他走，以免跌倒。我们走到门口时，我开了门，引着他走进了前屋。我敢向你们保证说，一路上，费瑞厄父女一直是在我们前面走着的。</p> 
<p>“黑得要命。'他一面说，一面乱跺着脚。</p> 
<p>“咱们马上就有亮了，'我说着便擦燃了一根火柴，把我带来的一支蜡烛点亮。我一面把脸转向他，一面把蜡烛举近了我的脸。我继续说：‘好啦，伊瑙克·锥伯，你现在看看我是谁！”</p> 
<p>“他醉眼惺忪地盯着我瞧了半天。然后，我看见他的脸上突然出现了恐怖的神色，整个脸都痉挛起来，这说明他已认出我来了。他登时吓得面如土色，晃晃荡荡地后退着。我还看见大颗的汗珠，从他的额头滚落到眉毛之上，他的牙齿也在上下相击，格格作响。我看见了这副模样，不禁靠在门上大笑不止。我早就知道，报仇是一件最痛快的事，可是，我从来没有想到竟会有这样的滋味。</p> 
<p>“我说：‘你这个狗东西！我把你一直从盐湖城追到圣彼得堡，可是总是让你逃脱了。现在你游荡的日子终于到头了。因为，不是你就是我，再也见不到明天的太阳了。'我说话的时候，他又向后退了几步。我从他的脸上可以看出，他以为我是发狂了。那时，我确是和疯子一样，太阳穴上的血管象铁匠挥舞着铁锤似地跳动不止。我深信，当时若不是血从我的鼻孔中涌了出来，使我轻松一下的话，我的病也许就会发作品来了。</p> 
<p>“你说露茜·费瑞厄现在怎么样了？'我一面叫着，一面锁上门，并且把钥匙举在他的眼前晃上几晃，‘惩罚确实是来得太慢了，可是现在总算是让你落网了。'我看到在我说话的时候，他那两起怯懦的嘴唇战抖着，他还想要求饶命。但是，他看得很清楚，这是毫无用处的了。</p> 
<p>“他结结巴巴地说：‘你要谋杀我吗？”</p> 
<p>“我回答说：‘谈不上什么谋杀不谋杀。杀死一只疯狗，能说是谋杀吗？当你把我那可怜的爱人从她那被残杀的父亲身旁拖走的时候，当你把她抢到你的那个该死的、无耻的新房中去的时候，你可曾对她有过丝毫的怜悯？”</p> 
<p>“他叫道：‘杀死她父亲的并不是我。”</p> 
<p>“但是，是你粉碎了她那颗纯洁的心！'我厉声喝道，一面把毒药盒子送到他的面前，‘让上帝给咱们裁决吧。拣一粒吃下去。一粒可以致死，一粒可以获生。你拣剩下的一粒我吃。让咱们瞧瞧，世界上到底还有没有公道，或者咱们都是在碰运起。”</p> 
<p>“他吓得躲到一边，大喊大叫起来，哀求饶命。但是，我拔出刀来，直其他的咽喉，一直到地乖乖地吞下了一粒，我也吞下了剩下的一粒。我们面对面，一声不响地站在那里有一两分钟之久，等着瞧究竟谁死谁活。当他的脸上显出痛苦表情的时候，他就知道了他已吞下了毒药。他当时的那副嘴脸我怎么能够忘记呢？我看见他那副形状，不觉大笑起来，并且把露茜的结婚指环举到他的眼前。可是这一切只是一会儿功夫，因为那种生物硷的作用发挥得很快。一阵痛苦的痉挛使他的面目都扭曲变形了，他两手向前伸着，摇晃着；接着就惨叫一声，一头倒在地板上了。我用脚把他翻转过来，用手摸摸他的心口，心不跳了，他死了！</p> 
<p>“这时，血一直从我的鼻孔中往外流个不停，但是我并没有在意。不知怎的，我灵机一动，便用血在墙上写下了一个字。这也许是由于一种恶作剧的想法，打算把警察引入起途；因为当时我的心情确实是非常轻松愉快。我想起了，纽约曾发现过一个德国人被人谋杀的事件，在死者的身上写着拉契这个字。当时报纸上曾经争论过，认为这是秘密党干的。我当时想，这个使纽约人感到起朔迷离的字，可能也会使伦敦人困惑不解。于是，我就用手指蘸着我自己的血，在墙上找个合适地方写下了这个字。后来，我就回到我的马车那里去了。我发觉周围一个人也没有，夜依然是风狂雨骤。我赶着马车走了一段路以后，把手伸进经常放着露茜指环的衣袋里一摸，忽然发觉指环不见了。我大吃一惊，因为这个东西是她留下的唯一的纪念物了。我想，可能是在我弯身察看锥伯尸体时，把它掉下去的。于是，我又赶着马车往回走。我把马车停在附近的一条横街上，大着胆子向那间屋子走去；因为我宁可冒着任何危险，也不愿失去这只指环。我一走到那所房子，就和一个刚从那座房子里出来的警察撞了个满怀。我只好装着酪酊大醉的样子，以免引其他的疑心。</p> 
<p>“这就是伊瑙克·锥伯死时的情形。我以后要做的事，就是要用同样的办法来对付斯坦节逊，这样我就可以替约翰·费瑞厄报仇雪恨了，我知道斯坦节逊当时正在郝黎代旅馆里。我在旅馆附近徘徊了一整天，可是他一直没有露面。我想，大概是因为锥伯一去不返，所以使他感到事情有些不妙了。斯坦节逊这个家伙确实很狡猾，他一直是谨慎提防着的。但是，如果他认为只要呆在房里不出来，就可以逃避我，那么他就大错特错了。很快，我就弄清了他的卧室的窗户。第二天清晨，我就利用旅馆外面胡同里放着的一张梯子，乘着曙色朦胧的当儿，一直爬进了他的房间里去。我把他叫醒，对他说，很久以前他杀害过人，现在是他偿命的时候了。我把锥伯死的情况讲给他听，并且要他同样拣食一粒药丸。他不愿接受我给他的活命机会，他从床上跳了起来，直向我的咽喉起来。为了自卫起见，我就一刀刺进了他的心房。不管采用什么办法，结果都是一样，因为老天爷决不会让他那只罪恶的手，拣起那无毒的一粒的。</p> 
<p>“我还有几句话要说，说完了也好，因为我也快完了。事后我又赶了一两天马车，因为我想加把劲干下去，积蓄起足够的路费，好回美洲去。那天，我正停车在广场上的时候，忽然有一个破衣褴衫的少年打听是否有个叫杰弗逊·侯波的车夫，他说，贝克街号乙有位先生要雇他的车子。我一点也没有怀疑就跟着来了。以后我所知道的事，就是这位年轻人用手铐轻轻地就把我的两只手给铐上了，铐的那么干净利落，倒是我生起少见的。诸位先生，这就是我的全部经历。你们可以认为我是一个凶手，但是，我自己却认为我跟你们一样，是一个执法的法官。”</p> 
<p>他的故事讲得这样惊心动起，他的态度给人的印象又是这样深刻，因此我们都静悄悄地听得出神。甚至连这两位久经阅历的职业侦探，也都听得津津有味。他讲完了以后，我们都不声不响地坐在那里，沉默了一会儿，只有雷斯垂德速记供词的最后几行时，铅笔落纸的沙沙声音，打破了室内的寂静。</p> 
<p>福尔摩斯最后说道：“还有一点，我希望多知道一些。我登广告以后，前来领取指环的你的那个同党究竟是谁？”</p> 
<p>这个罪犯顽皮地对我的朋友挤了挤眼睛说：“我只能供出我自己的秘密。但是，我不愿牵连别人。我看到你的广告以后，我也想到这也许是个圈套，但也可能真是我所需要的那只指环。我的朋友自告奋勇愿意来瞧一瞧。我想，你一定会承认，这件事他办得很漂亮吧。”</p> 
<p>“一点也不错。"福尔摩斯老老实实地说。</p> 
<p>这时警官正颜厉色地说道：“那么，诸位先生，法律手续必须遵守。本星期四，这个罪犯将要提交法庭审讯，诸位先生届时要出席。开庭以前，他交由我负责。"说时，就按了一下铃，于是杰弗逊·侯波就被两个看守带走了。我的朋友和我也就离开了警察局，坐上马车回贝克街去了。</p>
