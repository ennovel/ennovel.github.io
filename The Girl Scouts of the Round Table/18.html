<br> 
<br> After all, circumstances had been more powerful than Kara. The doctors had agreed that a sea voyage and a consultation with certain eminent surgeons in Europe would be helpful. So Kara had decided to accept the kindness from a stranger who might have played so different a r?le in the last twelve years of her life, but was now deeply anxious to make amends.
<br> 
<br> In any case Mr. Moore had intended going abroad for the summer with Lance McClain. He explained that he wanted Lance’s companionship, having developed a keen interest in him and wishing him to have the best possible musical education.
<br> 
<br> During the latter part of the spring—the date had not been finally settled—Mr. Moore, with Kara and Lance, was to sail for London.
<br> 
<br> 208 The length of Kara’s visit to Westhaven was to depend upon the time of departure.
<br> 
<br> It was pleasant to think of the number of invitations that the young girl, who had been in a fashion the ward of the village, had showered upon her for these few weeks before her farewell.
<br> 
<br> With something approaching relief, Kara allowed Miss Victoria Fenton to make the decision for her. She was to come directly to her brother and herself and her niece. Her other friends might see her there at any time, as their house was large and fairly quiet, when Tory permitted it to be. The downstairs bedroom, so rarely used, was at their guest’s disposal. Moreover, Miss Victoria permitted herself to acknowledge that she very much wanted the pleasure of having Kara in her home. She had developed a deep interest and affection for her.
<br> 
<br> For once Tory concurred with her aunt’s desire.
<br> 
<br> She was fascinated to observe Miss Victoria in her tender and thoughtful attitude toward Katherine Moore during her visit in their household and to learn her own lesson. Never had Miss Victoria outwardly displayed so209 much affection, not even toward her own brother, whom she adored. They had differed with regard to his engagement many years before, and, although neither was aware of the fact, the sympathy of their relation had never been entirely restored.
<br> 
<br> Kara’s practical nature, her humor and courage did not jar upon Miss Victoria, for she had been compelled by circumstances to spend her life with dreamers, who were trying to her narrow, well-ordered nature.
<br> 
<br> Moreover, she had a passion for looking after people who needed her. Kara was almost embarrassed by her kindness and her attentions until Tory confided the discovery she lately had made that her aunt required just what Kara could give her. Certainly Miss Victoria would rather have perished than confess the fact that in the past year she had suffered many qualms of jealousy over her brother’s and niece’s congeniality and a devotion that had left her out in the cold.
<br> 
<br> Kara had improved, but still continued to be troubled by a curious lack of sensation. She was forced to spend the greater part of her time either upon a couch or in a chair. It was difficult for Tory, who was not conspicuously unselfish; yet she had the generosity210 to leave Kara and her aunt alone as often as she could decide to make the sacrifice of the few remaining hours with the girl friend whom she had cared for from the hour of their original meeting.
<br> 
<br> The Round Table was toward the close of Kara’s stay in Westhaven. She was to sail early in May and must be back in New York for a week or more before the date set.
<br> 
<br> Without wavering, Kara still utterly declined to play any such fanciful r?le as a Knight of the Round Table. Notwithstanding Tory’s pleading, she would not come to the final meeting of the Round Table in any other costume than her Girl Scout one. She was keenly interested in the spectacle, however, and entreated the other Girl Scouts to allow her to see how they must have looked upon the Christmas Eve entertainment six months before.
<br> 
<br> The season made a difference in the decorations. No longer ornamented with pines and evergreens, the living-room of the House in the Woods was beautiful with spring flowers and shrubs.
<br> 
<br> Against the brown walls were branches of blossoming dogwood, long sprays of the fragrant, rose-pink trailing arbutus. On the211 mantel and tables were vases of white and purple lilacs and a single bowl of splendid crimson roses that had come to the House in the Woods with no card attached. The hostess understood, however, that they were a gift from Mr. Fenton.
<br> 
<br> To-night they stood in the center of the Round Table.
<br> 
<br> There was no raised dais, the Troop Captain insisting on having her place at the Round Table, which included Miss Frean.
<br> 
<br> Suspended from the rafters of the great room were the silver banners, no longer of unmarked silver cloth. Embroidered upon them in the chosen colors of the Knights were stories of their services during the past half year.
<br> 
<br> Edith Linder’s was the supreme achievement! No one of the Scouts in her Troop would have dreamed of disputing this fact.
<br> 
<br> To-night she wore the Golden Eaglet badge, the highest honor awarded a Scout. The single act of devotion on the part of one girl had afforded an example to the others. The sufferers from the great factory fire had received many kindnesses and attentions from the Girl Scouts Troop of the Eagle’s Wing. The little group of girls, members of a comparatively212 unknown organization in Westhaven a year and a half ago, were now accounted one of the chief factors for beauty and service in the village life.
<br> 
<br> Toward the close of this evening, Katherine Moore looked slowly from one face to the other of the friends surrounding her and then about the exquisite room, fragrant and shining with a wealth of green-and-white candles.
<br> 
<br> “To me it seems to have been a wonderful Scout winter, in spite of the fact that you told me until after Christmas you feared that you were slipping back from the enthusiasm of the early days of our Scouting. I am sorry, but I seem to be the only one of you who has done nothing. I am glad I declined to allow you to include me as a Knight of your Round Table. I should have proved neither a worthy Knight nor Scout.”
<br> 
<br> Kara was so unconscious of the impression that her words were making upon the group of girls that no one of them dared reply for a moment.
<br> 
<br> Then, not one of the Scouts answered, but the Troop Captain, Sheila Mason, with the gentler, happier expression that her Troop of girls were accustomed to seeing upon her face of late.
<br> 
<br> 213 “Perhaps, Kara, you do not recognise as we do what you have accomplished. Is it nothing to fight the good fight as you have fought it, to have kept your courage and faith and humor under such difficulties?
<br> 
<br> “The members of your Troop of Girl Scouts do not agree with you. Edith Linder is the only one of us who at present wears the Golden Eaglet badge. We have decided that one other girl from our Troop deserves this same token. Your record has been approved, Kara, so allow me to present you with the Golden Eaglet.”
<br> 
<br> The presentation was informal. After the Troop Captain had pinned the badge to the lapel of Kara’s pocket, she stooped and kissed her, her eyes suddenly filling with tears.
<br> 
<br> “We want you to wear this badge for more than one reason, Kara. If you are lonely among strangers in the days to come, think of the affection of the Girl Scouts. One or the other of us will have you in mind every hour of the day.”
<br> 
<br> An hour later the Round Table discussion had closed, not alone with farewells for Kara, but with whispered suggestions of future plans.
<br> 
<br> A few moments after Kara and Tory were together outside the door of the House in the214 Woods, waiting for the car that was to drive them home.
<br> 
<br> Above them in a nearly cloudless sky the moon swam, brilliant and serene.
<br> 
<br> “It was absurd of you, Kara, and so like you to suggest to-night that you were the least worthy member of our Troop of Girl Scouts. You may be a sensible and practical person, Kara, but just the same your humility was ill timed.”
<br> 
<br> “Don’t, please, Tory. Tease me on any other subject, but not that. I feel my own unworthiness even more deeply, and yet what could I do under the circumstances? Not to have accepted the undeserved honor would have been too ungracious! I seem to have many things bestowed upon me of late that I have no right to possess. Poor Mr. Moore and Lance! Can you imagine how bored they will be by my society?”
<br> 
<br> Tory shook her head, her eyes dark and soft in the moonlight, her lips red and trembling slightly.
<br> 
<br> “No, Kara, what you suggest is beyond even my imagination!
<br> 
<br> “Strange that you should be sailing for Europe and leaving me in Westhaven! Do you remember how we used to talk and dread215 the opposite thing happening? Then I supposed I would go away and you stay on here. I am sure I should be less missed.”
<br> 
<br> Kara laughed.
<br> 
<br> “No, Tory. You are the yeast in our dough. Don’t you realize this? Oh, I suppose I might have thought of a prettier figure of speech for you, but not a truer one. You have wakened us all, and brought us beauty and ways of thinking and living we would not have had in Westhaven without you.
<br> 
<br> “Now for a little while we must say good-by; but wait for me here, won’t you, Tory.”
<br> 
<br> The girls could hear the car stopping.
<br> 
<br> An instant Kara glanced upward and then at the scene before them—the open space, the tall freshly green trees, the figure of the girl beside her, glistening and radiant from the moonlight.
<br> 
<br> “You see, Tory, it is everywhere and all about us, what you say you wish, a shining world. We have said good-night and good-by; let us slip away quietly.”
