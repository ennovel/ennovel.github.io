<br> 
<br> "In the elucidation of a mystery there are facts which have to be slowly and laboriously built up; there are others which need no such process but establish themselves instantly in the analytical and well-balanced mind. Our reporter is gifted with such a mind, and certain facts connected with the case of M. Felix took instant form and order. We will set these facts before our readers briefly and concisely:
<br> 
<br> "It is necessary to premise--
<br> 
<br> "First, that M. Felix kept a loaded revolver beneath the pillows of his bed.
<br> 
<br> "Second, that when Constables Wigg and Nightingale, Mrs. Middlemore, and Dr. Lamb entered M. Felix's sitting-room after the door was forced open, the window was open.
<br> 
<br> "We now proceed to the sequence of events.
<br> 
<br> "Shortly before his death M. Felix, being alone in the house in Gerard Street, received a visitor. Whether expected or unexpected, whether welcome or unwelcome, we are not prepared to state; nor are we prepared to state how this visitor obtained entrance to the house. Obtain entrance by some means he undoubtedly did, and mounting the stairs, he knocked at the door of M. Felix's sitting-room. At the moment M. Felix heard the knock he had his Indian desk open before him, and it was in connection with a secret which this desk contained, or to which a document in the desk could afford a clue, that the visit was made. M. Felix, supposing that it was his housekeeper who knocked, opened the door and admitted the intruder. A stormy scene ensued, and M. Felix, throwing open his window, screamed for help. The appeal was sent forth into the wild night more from the fear that he was about to be robbed of this secret than from the fear that his life was in danger. The hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that there were no marks of personal violence on the body of M. Felix. The visitor laid hands upon the desk, and as he did so M. Felix turned from the window, snatched up the dagger, and hurled it with all his force at the robber. The sharp point struck into the flesh of the intruder, and it was his blood which was discovered on the floor of the room. The agitation produced by the scene brought on the attack of heart disease which caused M. Felix's death. The blind and momentary delirium which ensued did not prevent M. Felix from thinking of the revolver beneath his pillows; he staggered into his bedroom, but before he reached his bed he fell lifeless in a chair. While this was going on the robber had seized the desk, and, conscious that to carry away with him the evidence of a dagger dripping with blood might lead to his detection, he threw it swiftly from him behind the sideboard. He threw it with his right hand, his back being toward the door, which accounts for the place and position in which our reporter found the weapon. Then, with the desk in his possession, he escaped from the house--ignorant of the tragedy that had occurred, ignorant that M. Felix was lying dead within a few feet of him. He left the door open, but the fierce wind through the window blew it shut. It was while it was open that the cat which alarmed Mrs. Middlemore and the two constables crept into the room, became besmeared with blood, and crept out.
<br> 
<br> "The departure of the thief was like the falling of the curtain upon a pregnant act in an exciting drama. Imagination follows the man as he flies with his stolen treasure through the deserted streets; imagination wanders to the dead form of M. Felix lying in the chair by the bedside. When the curtain rises again, what will be disclosed?
<br> 
<br> "These thoughts came to the mind of our reporter with lightning rapidity. Mrs. Middlemore had opened the street door, had closed it again, and was now ascending the stairs. What should he do with the dagger?
<br> 
<br> "To retain it would be an unwarranted act, and might be construed into a theft. To take Mrs. Middlemore into his confidence might thwart his operations in the future. He put his hand behind the sideboard, and let the dagger fall. It was now safely hidden from sight, and its presence behind the sideboard could only be discovered, by any other person than himself, by the shifting of that piece of furniture.
<br> 
<br> "Mrs. Middlemore re-entered the room.
<br> 
<br> "'It was a runaway knock,' she said, 'The boys and girls take a pleasure in it. If I could ketch one of 'em I'd bang their head agin the wall.'
<br> 
<br> "'Did you see no one at all?' asked our reporter.
<br> 
<br> "'Only some people staring up at the winders,' replied Mrs. Middlemore. 'The 'ouse 'as become a regular show since that dreadful night. What do they expect to see?'
<br> 
<br> "'Perhaps the ghost of M. Felix,' suggested our reporter, with, it must be confessed, a rather feeble attempt at humor.
<br> 
<br> "'Don't mention sech a thing, sir,' said Mrs. Middlemore, piteously. 'It makes my flesh creep.'
<br> 
<br> "'I only said it in joke; there are no such things as ghosts and spirits.'
<br> 
<br> "'Some people believe otherwise sir.'
<br> 
<br> "'The more fools they. Well, Mrs. Middlemore, there is nothing more I wish to ask you just now; I must get back to my duties. But I must not waste your time for nothing.'
<br> 
<br> "He pressed into her willing palm another half-sovereign, making the second he had given her.
<br> 
<br> "'I'm sure you're very kind, sir,' said Mrs. Middlemore, after furtively glancing at the coin, to see that it was not a sixpence. 'Shall I see you agin?'
<br> 
<br> "'Yes. Good-night, Mrs. Middlemore.'
<br> 
<br> "'Good-night, sir,' she responded, as they went down-stairs. 'I 'ope Sophy won't be gone long.'
<br> 
<br> "'She'll be back soon, I daresay.' He paused in the passage. 'Mrs. Middlemore, are you satisfied that I am your friend?'
<br> 
<br> "'Yes, sir, I am.'
<br> 
<br> "'Then, if anything new occurs, you will let me know at once.'
<br> 
<br> "'I will, sir.'
<br> 
<br> "'And if it should happen,' said our reporter, 'that you remember anything you have forgotten to tell me, you will come and let me know it?'
<br> 
<br> "'I'll be sure to, sir.'
<br> 
<br> "Wishing her good-night again, he left the house, and heard her close the street door behind him with a bang.
<br> 
<br> "It was not without a motive that our reporter had addressed his last words to her. He had an idea that she had not been quite frank with him respecting M. Felix's visitors feeling assured that she could not be so entirely in the dark regarding them as she professed to be. His visit had not been fruitless; he had become acquainted with the loss of the desk, and he had discovered the dagger with its curiously shaped handle. Two steps advanced in the mystery, which might lead to something of importance.
<br> 
<br> "He walked slowly on, revolving these matters in his mind, and debating whether he could make any present use of them when his coat was plucked by a small hand. Looking down, he saw Sophy.
<br> 
<br> "'Ah, Sophy,' he said, 'what do you want?'
<br> 
<br> "'I've been waiting for yer,' said Sophy. 'I've got somethink to tell.'
<br> 
<br> "'Good. Where shall we talk?'
<br> 
<br> "Sophy's reply was a strange one. 'I know,' she said, where they sells fried fish and fried 'taters.' She smacked her lips.
<br> 
<br> "'You would like some?'
<br> 
<br> "'Wouldn't I? Jest?'
<br> 
<br> "'Lead the way, Sophy.'
<br> 
<br> "'You're a brick, old 'un, that's what you are.'
<br> 
<br> "She walked close to him, rubbing against him after the fashion of a friendly cat, and conducted him toward the purlieus of Drury Lane.
<br> 
<br> "'You're going to stand treat, ain't yer?'
<br> 
<br> "'Yes, Sophy, to as many fried potatoes and as much fried fish as you can comfortably tuck away.'
<br> 
<br> "'No gammon, yer know?'
<br> 
<br> "'I mean what I say, Sophy.'
<br> 
<br> "'Then there's stooed eels?'
<br> 
<br> "'All right; you shall have some.'
<br> 
<br> "'Don't say afterwards as I took you in. My inside's made of injer rubber. The more I puts in it the more it stretches.'
<br> 
<br> "'I don't mind, Sophy.'
<br> 
<br> "'You're somethink like a gent. I say, was aunty riled at the runaway knock?'
<br> 
<br> "'Oh, it was you, was it?'
<br> 
<br> "'Yes, it was me; I was gitting tired of waiting for yer. She's close, ain't she?'
<br> 
<br> "'Who? Your aunt?'
<br> 
<br> "'Yes; but I'm closer, I am. I could tell 'er somethink as 'd make 'er 'air stand on end.'
<br> 
<br> "'And you are going to tell it to me?'
<br> 
<br> "'Per'aps. If yer make it wuth my while.'
<br> 
<br> "'You shall have no reason to complain, Sophy. Is it about M. Felix?'
<br> 
<br> "'You wait till I've 'ad my tuck out.'
<br> 
<br> "Burning as he was with curiosity, our reporter wisely restrained his impatience. They had now arrived at the fried-potato shop, and Sophy stood before the open window with eager eyes. The potatoes were frizzling in the pan, and were being served out hot by a greasy Italian. His customers were of the very poorest sort, and most of them received the smoking hot potatoes in the street, and went away to eat them. You could purchase a half-penny's worth or a penny's worth the paper bags in which they were delivered being of different sizes. On the open slab in the window were pieces of fried plaice, tails, heads, and middles, the price varying according to the size. A few aristocratic customers were inside the shop, sitting upon narrow wooden benches, and eating away with an air of great enjoyment.
<br> 
<br> "'Don't they smell prime?' whispered Sophy.
<br> 
<br> "Our reporter assented, although the odor of fat which floated from the pan left, to the fastidious taste, something to be desired.
<br> 
<br> "'Will you eat your supper outside or in, Sophy?'
<br> 
<br> "Inside, old 'un,' said Sophy.
<br> 
<br> "They went into the shop and took their seats. There were no plates or knives or forks, but there was a plentiful supply of salt and pepper.
<br> 
<br> "'Can you manage without a plate?' asked our reporter.
<br> 
<br> "With her superior knowledge of the ways of this free-and-easy restaurant, Sophy replied, 'Plates be blowed!'
<br> 
<br> "'But you will certainly want a knife.'
<br> 
<br> "'No I shan't,' said Sophy, 'fingers was made before knives.'
<br> 
<br> "With two large middle slices of fried fish and a penny's worth of fried potatoes spread upon a piece of newspaper before her, Sophy fell to with a voracious appetite. In his position of host our reporter was compelled to make a sacrifice, and he therefore toyed with a small heap of fried potatoes, and put a piece occasionally into his mouth. His critical report is that they were not at all bad food; it was the overpowering smell of fat that discouraged this martyr to duty.
<br> 
<br> "'I say,' said Sophy, 'ain't yer going to 'ave some fried fish? Do 'ave some! You don't know 'ow good it is.'
<br> 
<br> "'I am eating only out of politeness, Sophy,' said our reporter, watching the child with wonder; she had disposed of her first batch and was now busy upon a second supply. 'I have not long had my dinner.'
<br> 
<br> "'Ain't we proud?' observed the happy girl. 'I like my dinner--when I can git it, old 'un--in the middle of the day, not in the middle of the night.'
<br> 
<br> "'You eat as if you were hungry, Sophy.'
<br> 
<br> "'I'm allus 'ungry. You try and ketch me when I ain't!'
<br> 
<br> "'Doesn't your aunt give you enough?'
<br> 
<br> "'She 'lowances me, and ses I mustn't over-eat myself. As if I could! I ses to 'er sometimes, "Give me a chance, aunt!" I ses; and she ups and ses she knows wot's good for me better than I do myself, and all the while she's eating and drinking till she's fit to bust. She's fond of her innards, is aunt. Never mind, it'll be my turn one day, you see if it won't. There, I'm done. Oh, don't you stare! I could eat a lot more, but there's stooed eels to come, I do like stooed eels, I do!'
<br> 
<br> "Our reporter had no reason to complain of Sophy's extravagance; though she had disposed of four slices of fried fish and two helpings of fried potatoes, his disbursement amounted to no more than tenpence half-penny. Upon leaving the shop Sophy again assumed the command, and conducted our reporter to the stewed-eel establishment, where she disposed of three portions, which the proprietor ladled out in very thick basins. The host of this magnificent entertainment was somewhat comforted to find that although fingers were made before knives (and presumably, therefore, before spoons), Sophy was provided with a very substantial iron spoon to eat her succulent food with. As in the fried-potato establishment there was a plentiful supply of salt and pepper, so here there was a plentiful supply of pepper and vinegar, of which Sophy liberally availed herself. At the end of her third basin Sophy raised her eyes heavenward and sighed ecstatically.
<br> 
<br> "'Have you had enough?' asked our reporter.
<br> 
<br> "'Enough for once,' replied Sophy, with a prudent eye to the future. 'I wouldn't call the Queen my aunt.'
<br> 
<br> "Our reporter did not ask why, Sophy's tone convincing him that the observation was intended to express a state of infinite content, and had no reference whatever to Mrs. Middlemore.
<br> 
<br> "'Now, Sophy,' he said, 'are you ready to tell me all you know?'
<br> 
<br> "'I'll tell yer a lot,' said Sophy, and if you ain't sapparized--well, there!'
<br> 
<br> "Another colloquialism, which our reporter perfectly understood.
<br> 
<br> "'What will your aunt say?' he asked--they had left the shop, and were walking side by side--'to your coming home late?'
<br> 
<br> "'Wot she likes,' replied Sophy, with a disdainful disregard of consequences. 'If she don't like it she may lump it. Don't frighten yerself; she's used to it by this time. Where are you going to take me?'
<br> 
<br> "Our reporter had settled this in his mind. 'To my rooms, where we can talk without interruption.'
<br> 
<br> "'Oh, but I say,' exclaimed Sophy, 'won't they stare!'
<br> 
<br> "'There will be no one to do that, Sophy, and you will be quite safe.'
<br> 
<br> "Sophy nodded, and kept step with him as well as she could. It was not easy, by reason of her boots being odd, and not only too large for her feet, but in a woful state of dilapidation. In one of the narrow streets through which they passed, a second-hand clothing shop was open, in the window of which were displayed some half-dozen pairs of children's boots. A good idea occurred to him.
<br> 
<br> "'Your boots are worn out, Sophy.'
<br> 
<br> "'There's 'ardly any sole to 'em,' remarked Sophy.
<br> 
<br> "'Would a pair of those fit you?'
<br> 
<br> "'Oh, come along. I don't want to be made game of.'
<br> 
<br> "'I am not doing so, Sophy,' said our reporter, slipping three half-crowns into her hand. 'Go in, and buy the nicest pair you can; and mind they fit you properly.'
<br> 
<br> "Sophy raised her eyes to his face, and our reporter observed, without making any remark thereon, that they were quite pretty eyes, large, and of a beautiful shade of brown, and now with a soft light in them. She went into the shop silently, and returned, radiant and grateful, shod as a human being ought to be.
<br> 
<br> "'Do yer like 'em?' she asked, putting one foot on the ledge of the shop window.
<br> 
<br> "'They look very nice,' he said. 'I hope they're a good fit?'
<br> 
<br> "'They're proper. 'Ere's yer change, and I'm ever so much obliged to yer.'
<br> 
<br> "The words were commonplace, but her voice was not. There was in it a note of tearful gratefulness which was abundant payment for an act of simple kindness. Utilitarians and political economists may smile at our statement that we owe the poor a great deal, and that but for them we should not enjoy some of the sweetest emotions by which the human heart can be stirred."
