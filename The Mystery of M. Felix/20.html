MRS. MIDDLEMORE IS VICTIMIZED.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      "Outside the court-house our reporter found Mrs. Middlemore still waiting. He took her by the arm, and led her unceremoniously away. Stopping on the opposite side of the road, he said to her:
<br> 
<br> "'Now, Mrs. Middlemore, what brought you here?'
<br> 
<br> "'I was sent for, sir,' she answered.
<br> 
<br> "'By whom?'
<br> 
<br> "'By the magerstate.'
<br> 
<br> "'Where is the paper?'
<br> 
<br> "'What paper, sir?'
<br> 
<br> "'The summons.'
<br> 
<br> "'I ain't got none. The perlice orficer comes to me and ses, "Mrs. Middlemore," he ses, "you must go immediate to the Bow Street Perlice Station, and wait outside till yer called." "But what about?" I arks. "About Mr. Felix," he answers; "somethink's been found out, and they can't git on without yer. Yer'll have to wait a longish time per'aps, but if yer move away till yer called it'll be worse for yer." "But what am I to do about the 'ouse?" I arks. "Sophy's out, and there's no one to mind it." "I'll mind it," ses the perlice orficer, "and when Sophy comes back I'll let her in. Off yer go, and don't tell nobody at Bow Street what yer've come about. It's a secret, and the Government won't stand it being talked of. Yer'll be paid for yer trouble." So off I starts, and 'ere 'ave I been waiting for nigh upon two hours, and nobody's made a move toward me.'
<br> 
<br> "'I've heard something of this,' said our reporter, pushing Mrs. Middle more into a cab, and giving the driver instructions to drive quickly to Gerard Street. It was not without difficulty he succeeded in this, for Mrs. Middlemore, with the fear of the 'Government' upon her, wanted to remain in Bow Street. 'I met Sophy before I came here, and she told me you had been sent for to the police Station. Now be quiet, will you? Have you not promised to be guided by me?'
<br> 
<br> "'But the Government, sir, the Government! I shall be clapped in prison!'
<br> 
<br> "'You'll be nothing of the sort. The Government and I are friends, and you are perfectly safe if you do as I tell you.'
<br> 
<br> "'I must, I serpose, sir. There's nothink else for it, but I'm being wore to a shadder. If this goes on much longer I sha'n't 'ave a ounce of flesh on my bones. Yer sor Sophy, sir, did yer? Yer've been at the 'ouse, then?'
<br> 
<br> "'Yes, I have been at your house, but it was not there that I saw your niece. I met her in the street, and she informed me that you were at Bow Street Police Station.'
<br> 
<br> "'What was the 'uzzy doing in the streets?'
<br> 
<br> "'I can't say, but in the streets she was forced to remain.'
<br> 
<br> "'Why, sir, the 'ouse was open to 'er. I met 'er and told 'er to go 'ome and wait till I come back.'
<br> 
<br> "'Exactly. And she did go, and knocked at the door, as I did, but she was as unsuccessful as I was. She did not get in.'
<br> 
<br> "''Ow can that be, sir? The perlice officer was there, waiting to open the door for 'er. The lazy slut! She's been telling yer a parcel of lies.'
<br> 
<br> "'How about myself, Mrs. Middlemore? Am I telling you a parcel of lies when I say that I knocked pretty loudly at your door, and that no one came to open it.'
<br> 
<br> "'I wouldn't dispute your word, sir, but I can't make it out.'
<br> 
<br> "'I can, and I will explain it to you presently, inside your house, if we can manage to get in. Here we are. Jump out.'
<br> 
<br> "The cab being discharged, Mrs. Middlemore knocked and rang, but knocked and rang in vain.
<br> 
<br> "'Allo, anty!' said Sophy, coming up. ''Ave they found Mr. Felix's body?'
<br> 
<br> "''Ush, you 'uzzy,' said Mrs. Middlemore, clapping her hand on the girl's mouth. 'What do yer mean by being outside instead of in?'
<br> 
<br> "'What do I mean?' retorted Sophy, with an air of great enjoyment. 'Why, 'cause I couldn't git in. I knocked and knocked, jest as you're doing of now, but nobody answered.'
<br> 
<br> "'I understood,' said our reporter to Mrs. Middlemore, 'that you generally carry your latchkey with you.'
<br> 
<br> "'So I do sir, but I didn't 'ave it in my pocket when the perlice officer come; it was downstairs on the kitchen table. I wanted to go down and fetch it, but he wouldn't let me wait a minute. "If yer ain't quick," he said, "yer'll git yerself in trouble;" and he bundled me out of the 'ouse. That's 'ow it was, sir.'
<br> 
<br> "'The question is,' said our reporter, 'how we are to get in. Is there a back way?'
<br> 
<br> "'No, sir.'
<br> 
<br> "'Then we must get in by the front door or window. The window will be the easiest. It is fastened inside in the usual way, I suppose?'
<br> 
<br> "'Yes, sir.'
<br> 
<br> "'The easiest plan will be for me to break one of the panes in such a manner as to attract as little notice as possible, and then put my hand through and undo the fastening. Then we can lift the sash, and Sophy can get in and unlock the street door for us.'
<br> 
<br> "I'm game,' said Sophy, to whom any task of this kind was especially inviting.
<br> 
<br> "Our reporter was about to put his plan into execution when Mrs. Middlemore clutched his arm. He instantly withdrew it.
<br> 
<br> "'Of course, Mrs. Middlemore,' he said, coldly, 'it is your house, and I can't commit a trespass without your permission.'
<br> 
<br> "'It ain't that, sir,' said Mrs. Middlemore, piteously. 'Sophy's a plucky little thing, and though I do give 'er a 'ard word now and then, I mean well by 'er, I do indeed, sir.'
<br> 
<br> "'Yer a good sort, aunty,' said Sophy. 'I don't mind yer 'ard words, not a bit.'
<br> 
<br> "''Old yer saucy tongue, and let me speak to the gentleman. Yes, sir, I mean well by Sophy, and I should never 'ave another minute's peace if anythink was to appen to 'er.'
<br> 
<br> "'What do you think will happen to her if I do what I propose?'
<br> 
<br> "'There's been one sudding death in the 'ouse, sir----.'
<br> 
<br> "'Go on, Mrs. Middlemore. Don't stop in the middle of a sentence; finish what you have to say. Time is very precious just now.'
<br> 
<br> "There's been one sudding death in the 'ouse, and now there's a man in there as won't or can't answer.'
<br> 
<br> "'You fear he might be dead. If so, he cannot do Sophy any harm. Eh, Sophy?'
<br> 
<br> "'Not 'im. It'd take more nor one dead man to scare Sophy. Jest you open the winder, and I'll be in like a shot.'
<br> 
<br> "'Have I your permission now, Mrs. Middlemore?'
<br> 
<br> "'But if he shouldn't be dead, sor. If he was laying in wait with a crowbar to knock Sophy on the 'ead----'
<br> 
<br> "'Oh, you are beginning to think the man who called upon you was not a police officer, after all?'
<br> 
<br> "'I'm beginning to have my doubts, sir.'
<br> 
<br> "'I never had any. He is as much a police officer as you are. He told you a cock and bull story, and got rid of you. He was left in the house alone, and, more for your sake than my own, I want to find out what he has been up to. Decide quickly, please.'
<br> 
<br> "'Do what you like, sir. You've been right in everything; but things are getting more and more mysterious.'
<br> 
<br> "Without wasting more words our reporter pushed his elbow into a pane, and putting his hand through, undid the fastening and raised the sash. Sophy climbed in like a cat, and the next minute the street door was open. They entered and closed the door behind them.
<br> 
<br> "'We will proceed systematically,' said our reporter. 'The man spoke to you in the passage here.'
<br> 
<br> "'Yes, sir; and sed he'd wait.'
<br> 
<br> "'Did you tell him to wait in the kitchen, or the parlor, or in any particular room?'
<br> 
<br> "'No, sir; I left it to 'im.'
<br> 
<br> "'Doubtless he has been into every room in the house. We will go into the kitchen first.'
<br> 
<br> "Nothing had been disturbed there; the key of the street-door was on the kitchen table. Our reporter took it up and examined it closely.
<br> 
<br> "'As I imagined,' he said. 'He has taken an impression of the key in wax.'
<br> 
<br> "'What for, sir?' asked Mrs. Middlemore, in great trepidation.
<br> 
<br> "'To enable him to enter the house again secretly, if he wished. When I am gone send for a plumber and a locksmith. Let the plumber put in the pane of glass, and have another lock put on the street door. Your visitor must have been in a hurry, or he would have cleaned this key more carefully.'
<br> 
<br> "From the kitchen they went into the parlor, and apparently nothing had been disturbed there. Then they proceeded upstairs to the rooms occupied by M. Felix.
<br> 
<br> "'Look carefully round,' said our reporter, 'and tell me if anything has been taken away.'
<br> 
<br> "'Nothink, sir, that I can see.'
<br> 
<br> "'But there may have been papers, or money, or something of which he wishes to obtain possession, secreted somewhere, and it is quite likely he may have found them.'
<br> 
<br> "'I won't dispute you, sir. You see further than I do; but it don't seem as if anythink's been took.'
<br> 
<br> "'Or moved? The ornaments on the mantelshelf--are they all there?'
<br> 
<br> "'I don't miss one, sir.'
<br> 
<br> "'But they have been shifted. Here is this vase; observe the circle upon which it stood. The vase has been lifted and put down again, but not on the exact spot it occupied when he took it up. This proves the object for which he came; he has been searching for something, and has probably found it and taken it away. How could you have been so foolish as to leave him in the house alone?'
<br> 
<br> "Mrs. Middlemore sank helpless into a chair, and moaned. 'What else could I do, sir, what else could I do? It'll be the death of me, I know it will!'
<br> 
<br> "'Not at all. It only proves that we have cunning persons to work against. I am all the more determined to track this mystery down.' He opened the bedroom door, and exclaimed, 'Here is direct evidence. The fellow has not been so careful in this room. Chairs have been moved, the bedclothes are disturbed. Why, where is the revolver?'
<br> 
<br> "He referred to the revolver which he had found beneath the pillows, and which he had replaced. It had been abstracted. Inwardly he congratulated himself that he had not only taken a full note of the description of the weapon, but had also scratched the initial,'F.' on the metal. He took, out his pocketbook and turned to the page upon which he had made an entry.
<br> 
<br> "'Listen to this, Mrs. Middlemore, and be thankful that you have a friend like me on your side: "A Colt's double action revolver, nickel-plated, six shots, No. 819." I can swear to that revolver, and moreover can swear that it was loaded. Are you satisfied now that you have been imposed upon, and that the man who visited you came upon a bogus errand?'
<br> 
<br> "'Of course I am, sir, but what could 'ave been 'is objec'--'Oh, what could 'ave been 'is objec'?'
<br> 
<br> "'That has yet to be discovered, and discovered it shall be. The abstraction of this revolver may assist us. The fellow does not dream that I have its description here, and that it can be sworn to. Surely he was not dressed as a policeman?'
<br> 
<br> "'No, sir, he sed he was a private officer.'
<br> 
<br> "'And you believed him?'
<br> 
<br> "Again Mrs. Middlemore moaned, 'What else could I do, sir? what else could I do? He spoke that confident and easy that an angel would 'ave believed what he sed.'
<br> 
<br> "'Don't be taken in again. Be just a little more careful in your dealings with strangers.'
<br> 
<br> "'I will, sir, I will.'
<br> 
<br> "'I don't see that I can do any good by remaining here. I should like, though, to take down from your lips a description of the man. You can give it to me, I hope?'
<br> 
<br> "'I can, sir. A tall man, very thin, with a long thin face and thick black eyebrows.'
<br> 
<br> "'Is that all?'
<br> 
<br> "'All I can remember, sir.'
<br> 
<br> "Our reporter wrote the words in his pocketbook, and asked, 'Can you tell me how he was dressed?'
<br> 
<br> "'Only that he had dark clothes on.'
<br> 
<br> "'You would know him again if you saw him?'
<br> 
<br> "'I could swear to him, sir.'
<br> 
<br> "'Come, that is a satisfaction. You can swear to the man, and I can swear to the revolver. Two direct pieces of evidence, if we can lay hands upon them.'
<br> 
<br> "Sophy unexpectedly presented herself as an additional witness. 'I can swear to 'im too,' she said.
<br> 
<br> "'Ah, Sophy, you are invaluable,' said our reporter.
<br> 
<br> "'Didn't I say the slut was telling us a parcel of lies?' cried Mrs. Middlemore, making a movement as though she were about to fall upon the girl.
<br> 
<br> "'Easy, Mrs. Middlemore, easy,' said our reporter, holding the housekeeper back. 'Let us hear what Sophy has to say.'
<br> 
<br> "But Sophy, firing up, diverged a moment. 'Jest look 'ere, aunty,' she said, with spirit. 'Don't yer be so fast with yer sluts and yer 'uzzies. I'm gitting tired of it, I am. I ain't told one lie yet, and if yer don't mind what yer about I'll keep my mouth shut.'
<br> 
<br> "'No, Sophy, my girl,' said our reporter, 'you will do nothing of the sort. You will tell me all you know about this man.'
<br> 
<br> "'Jest you make 'er be civil, then,' said Sophy. 'She does nothink but bully me day and night. She don't pay me no wages, and I ain't going to stand it.'
<br> 
<br> "'Be reasonable Sophy,' said our reporter. 'Your aunt is worried, and you must make excuses for her.'
<br> 
<br> "'Ain't I flesh and blood the same as she is?' continued the irate girl. 'I've a good mind to run away from 'er, that I am, and never come back no more. I'll do it. Tata, aunty, and thank yer for nothink.'
<br> 
<br> "Had it not been for our reporter, she would have run out of the house. He laid his hand gently on her arm, and said:
<br> 
<br> "'Don't forget your promise to me, Sophy.'
<br> 
<br> "'I won't; I'll keep it, never fear. I'll wear myself to skin and bone for yer--yes, I will, if it'll do yer any good; but I won't be bullied by 'er no more.'
<br> 
<br> "Sophy's threat terrified Mrs. Middlemore; the prospect of being left in the house alone was appalling, and she straightway fell to on humble pie.
<br> 
<br> "'I'm sorry for what I sed, Sophy, and I beg yer parding, and I'll give yer sixpence a week. There, now, be a good gal. But yer did tell us yer couldn't git into the 'ouse.'
<br> 
<br> "'No more I could. I knocked and rattled and kicked the door, and nobody come. 'Ow should I know that a tall, thin man, with a long face and thick black eyebrows, was the feller as took yer in?'
<br> 
<br> "'You saw him, then?' said our reporter, observing that Mrs. Middlemore's apology and, the promise of sixpence a week had mollified the girl.
<br> 
<br> "'Yes, I sor 'im before I got to the 'ouse, but I didn't know he come out of it. He was jest what aunty sed he was, and what's more, he 'ad large flat feet.'
<br> 
<br> "'If you saw him again you could swear to him?'
<br> 
<br> "'I'd pick 'im out of a thousan.' He run agin me, he did, and I sed, "Who are yer pushing of?" He didn't say nothink, but walked off forty to the dozen.'
<br> 
<br> "'Looking as if he did not wish to attract notice?'
<br> 
<br> "'Yes, he did look like that.'
<br> 
<br> "'Was he carrying anything?'
<br> 
<br> "'Not that I sor. He 'ad 'is coat buttoned up.'
<br> 
<br> "'When he come to me,' said Mrs. Middlemore, 'it was unbuttoned.'
<br> 
<br> "'Proving that he took something away with him. Anything else Sophy?'
<br> 
<br> "'Nothink else.'
<br> 
<br> "'You and your aunt are friends now, are you not?'
<br> 
<br> "'Oh, I don't bear no malice.'
<br> 
<br> "Mrs. Middlemore kissed Sophy, and her anger was entirely dispelled. Once more our reporter, having made peace between them, attempted to leave, but Mrs. Middlemore said, imploringly:
<br> 
<br> "'Would yer mind looking all over the 'ouse fust? He might be 'iding in it to murder us in the night.'
<br> 
<br> "'Sophy saw him walking away,' said our reporter; 'but to satisfy you I will go into every room; and I'll do something more, if you are agreeable. Could you make me up a bed?'
<br> 
<br> "'Yes, sir, I could, in any room you like.'
<br> 
<br> "'M. Felix's bedroom will do for me. Don't look startled; I am almost as brave as Sophy. Put the bed straight, and I'll come some time between eleven and twelve o'clock, and pass the night here.'
<br> 
<br> "Mrs. Middlemore was profuse in her thanks, and our reporter searched the house from top to bottom. Assuring the housekeeper that she was quite safe, he succeeded in making his escape."
