Jack was relieved not to find him. Full of his new plans, he went on down to the office. He was now attired again his proper person as Mr. Robinson of course. He looked up Baldwin at the desk. Baldwin naturally was keen to know more about the mysterious case that Jack was engaged on.
<br> 
<br> "Baldwin, I've got a new line on my man," said Jack. "Do you happen to know any of the men behind the desk at the Bienvenu?"
<br> 
<br> "Surest thing you know. I've got a pal there. Name of Dick Starr."
<br> 
<br> "What's his job?"
<br> 
<br> "Room clerk. One of the head men."
<br> 
<br> "Will you introduce me?"
<br> 
<br> "Sure! When?"
<br> 
<br> "The sooner the better."
<br> 
<br> "I'm coming off duty now. I'll go right down there with you."
<br> 
<br> Starr of the Bienvenu proved to be just such another suave and irreproachable man of the world as Baldwin, but somewhat older. He knew all about Jack; no doubt the two friends had discussed him. While the real secret of Jack's identity was safe, it was understood among those whose business it was to inform themselves of such matters, that the secretary was the real power behind the Norman throne. Consequently he enjoyed more than the usual consideration shown to a multi-millionaire's secretary.
<br> 
<br> Starr took them into a little room behind the office.
<br> 
<br> Jack said: "The fact is, I'm doing a bit of detective work for my employer, and one of my clues leads to the Bienvenu. I want your help."
<br> 
<br> "Anything in my power!" Starr assured him.
<br> 
<br> "You have a young lady stopping here called Miriam Culbreth?"
<br> 
<br> Starr nodded. "Some Cleopatra!" he murmured.
<br> 
<br> "The same," said Jack. "Now some time during the next few days I have reason to believe that a package will be sent her by messenger. Small, flat packet about three inches by seven."
<br> 
<br> "Packages don't go through the desk."
<br> 
<br> "But in this case I am pretty sure the boy will be instructed to hand it to her personally."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, in that case—Want me to have a look in it?"
<br> 
<br> "Simpler than that!" said Jack. "Just get me that boy's number so I can trace him."
<br> 
<br> Starr assured Jack that he would be happy to serve him. He seemed a little disappointed that he was not called upon to play a more important part.
<br> 
<br> They strolled out into the lobby again, and at that identical instant Miriam herself came through the revolving doors. But Jack saw her first.
<br> 
<br> "Duck, you fellows! Duck!" he whispered swiftly. "Make out you don't know me!"
<br> 
<br> Messrs. Baldwin and Starr being experienced men of the world, knew how to act. They inconspicuously faded from Jack's side.
<br> 
<br> Miriam in sables and paradise plumes swam into the Bienvenu like a swan. Not a man in the place but drew a long breath of longing at the sight of her and looked enviously at the man slinking at her heels. Your haughty beauty always brings a man with her like a small dog on a leader.
<br> 
<br> This man was Bobo.
<br> 
<br> Jack went up to them with glad smiles. "Hello! This is a surprise!"
<br> 
<br> It was manifestly a surprise to them. Bobo turned a delicate pea green shade, and had nothing to say. The girl smiled charmingly, but her eyes were like two points of ice.
<br> 
<br> Jack thought: "She thinks I've tracked them here. There's something up. I'll find out what it is."
<br> 
<br> "We just dropped in for tea," said Miriam languidly.
<br> 
<br> "Fine!" said Jack. "I'm starving! I'll join you."
<br> 
<br> She laughed like icicles tinkling. "Hadn't you better wait until——"
<br> 
<br> "Pshaw! What's an invite between friends!" said Jack. "Come on, I'll blow."
<br> 
<br> Miss Culbreth was a resourceful person, and eminently self-possessed, but for once Jack had the satisfaction of putting her out of countenance. She turned indignantly to Bobo, as if to call upon him to assert himself, but seeing that she could expect no help from that stricken figure, she hung her head uncertainly. Jack led the pair of them like lambs to the slaughter to the tea room.
<br> 
<br> Passing the elevators Bobo said huskily: "Thought you were going upstairs to dress."
<br> 
<br> "I won't bother now," she said.
<br> 
<br> Jack thought: "Wouldn't leave him alone with me for a farm!"
<br> 
<br> As a tea-party, the half hour that followed was not a howling success. Bobo crouched in his chair avoiding Jack's eye like a guilty spaniel. Miriam kept her eyes down too, but for a different reason; she didn't want Jack to see the hatred that burned there. The tapering white hand trembled a little in the business of pouring tea.
<br> 
<br> The onus of keeping things going was therefore upon Jack. Something humorous in the situation excited his risibilities. He experienced a pleasant malice in making out to the others that he saw nothing out of the way. He rattled on like a youth without a care in the world. Anything furnished him with a cue.
<br> 
<br> "See that old girl in crimson velvet. The famous Mrs. Paul Towers. Used to be Mrs. Peter Vesey. Sold herself to Peter in order to buy Paul, the saying is around town. That's Paul Towers with her. Exactly half her age. Poor devil! He pays high for his meals. They say he has to turn in an itemized expense account like a traveling salesman."
<br> 
<br> "He's not the only parasite in town," remarked Miriam acidly.
<br> 
<br> Jack chuckled. "Bless your heart, no! The woods are full of us! What's a handsome young man with delightful manners and not a cent to his name going to do!"
<br> 
<br> Miriam snorted scornfully.
<br> 
<br> "But I tell you it's no cinch to be a parasite," continued Jack. "It requires qualifications of a very high order. Firstly, a resolute determination not to work. Any fool can work, but it needs character to idle gracefully. Then a parasite must have A1 cheek, nerve, brass, gall. It takes an unusual man to make a success of it."
<br> 
<br> "You're forgetting some of the qualifications," said Miriam.
<br> 
<br> "I daresay. It's an all round man's job."
<br> 
<br> "Meanness, obsequiousness, conceit!"
<br> 
<br> "All very fine qualities!" said Jack with inimitable gravity.
<br> 
<br> They had been at the table about half an hour when a boy passed through the tea room paging Miss Culbreth. Miriam and Bobo both affected not to hear him, but Jack, scenting developments, called him to their table, and indicated Miriam to him.
<br> 
<br> "Mr. Spragge is calling," the boy said to Miriam. "Said he was expected."
<br> 
<br> "Tell him I'm engaged, and he needn't wait," said Miriam languidly. "Say that I will let him hear from me."
<br> 
<br> Jack noticed that Bobo was betraying an extraordinary agitation. Following a sudden impulse, Jack said carelessly to the boy:
<br> 
<br> "Who is Mr. Spragge, son?"
<br> 
<br> Fire flashed from Miriam's eyes, but before she could stop the boy he had answered involuntarily: "The reverend Mr. Spragge, sir. Parson lives in the house here."
<br> 
<br> "Oh!" said Jack drily.
<br> 
<br> The boy departed.
<br> 
<br> There was silence at the table. The constraint which had formerly lain upon them was as the gayety of a childish game to this. Miriam had turned very pale, and she was breathing quickly—signs of rage in her. Bobo's chin lay on his breast, and he was visibly desirous of slipping right under the table cloth.
<br> 
<br> Jack enjoyed his little triumph in silence. A single word would have precipitated an explosion from Miriam. For reasons of his own Jack wished to avoid a general show-down, and he did not speak it.
<br> 
<br> He presently resumed the feather-brained rattle, and the tension was a little relieved. The simple-minded Bobo cheered up, evidently having persuaded himself that Jack had attached no significance to the mention of the parson. But the girl knew better. She watched Jack with somber eyes, waiting for him to unmask his guns.
<br> 
<br> When they had finished their tea Jack ostentatiously consulted his watch. "By George! We'll have to be getting back to the Madagascar!" he cried.
<br> 
<br> "Who's we?" asked Miriam with a sneer.
<br> 
<br> "Bobo and I. Mr. Delamare's dining with us to-night," Jack lied glibly.
<br> 
<br> "Is that true?" Miriam demanded of Bobo.
<br> 
<br> Poor Bobo lacked the backbone to come out flatly for either one side or the other. He fidgetted miserably. "I don't know. Maybe. I forget."
<br> 
<br> Miriam's luscious mouth had become a thin red line. "He can't go. He has an engagement with me."
<br> 
<br> "Now that's too bad!" said Jack with deceitful solicitude. "He can't disappoint a big man like Mr. Delamare. Besides, there are important matters to be decided."
<br> 
<br> Miriam was near the fulminating point. She looked stormily at Bobo. "Well? Have you nothing to say? It's up to you!"
<br> 
<br> Bobo made a pitiable attempt to assert himself, but he could not meet Jack's eye. "I didn't know he was coming," he muttered. "I can't go now. Anyway you know about everything. You can talk to him."
<br> 
<br> "There are papers to be signed," said Jack. "I can't do that."
<br> 
<br> Bobo hung in an abject state of indecision.
<br> 
<br> Miriam could stand no more. She kept her voice low out of respect to the other people in the tea room, but her words lost none of their force thereby. "Are you going to sit there and let this nobody tell you what to do? If you've got a spark of manliness, why don't you put him in his place? He mocks you to your face! His very look is an insult to me! Are you going to stand for that? Why don't you invite him to kick you while he's at it?"
<br> 
<br> Jack thought: "Good Lord! Will he still want to marry her after getting such a taste of her quality as that?"
<br> 
<br> Bobo still hung his head. Jack could not but feel a certain pity for him. After all it was he, Jack, who had got him into this mess.
<br> 
<br> "If you won't tell him I will!" said Miriam. She turned her blazing eyes on Jack. "Go! And the next time wait until you are asked, before you thrust yourself on your betters! You are only an upper servant. You have presumed on his good nature until now you think you are the master. I warn you you'll find a different kind of person in me! I can keep you in your place!"
<br> 
<br> Jack received this with a smile. He was thinking: "You are not Mrs. Norman yet, my lady!"
<br> 
<br> She read the thought as clearly as if it had been spoken. "I'm not afraid of you! You can't stop me in anything I mean to do! I despise you!"
<br> 
<br> "Well, there's virtue in frankness," murmured Jack. "But let's not rattle the family skeleton in public."
<br> 
<br> It was true, people were beginning to look curiously towards their table.
<br> 
<br> "After all, it's a simple matter," Jack went on, "and it's entirely up to Bobo. Bobo, are you coming with me, or are you going to stay here?"
<br> 
<br> "I'll stay," muttered Bobo sullenly.
<br> 
<br> Miriam smiled triumphantly.
<br> 
<br> Jack appeared to give in good-humoredly. "Suits me," he said.
<br> 
<br> They rose from the table. Out in the corridor while Jack and Bobo were obtaining their hats and coats, there was a brief moment during which they were out of hearing of Miriam.
<br> 
<br> "Bobo," said Jack firmly, "if you don't come home with me, I swear I'll tell her the truth and leave you to your fate!"
<br> 
<br> Bobo was like a poor little grain of wheat between two hard mill-stones. He shivered. "How can I get away from her?" he whined. Obviously he was more afraid of Miriam than of Jack.
<br> 
<br> "Leave that to me," said Jack.
<br> 
<br> Miriam was watching them suspiciously. They rejoined her. At the elevator she said offhand to Bobo:
<br> 
<br> "You may come up. I have a sitting-room."
<br> 
<br> Miriam entered the elevator in advance, of course. Jack took a firm grip of Bobo's arm.
<br> 
<br> "Well, good-by," said Jack pleasantly. He squeezed Bobo's arm suggestively.
<br> 
<br> "G-good-by," stammered Bobo. "I have to go with Jack."
<br> 
<br> Whereupon Jack turned him about smartly, and marched him out towards the main entrance. Miriam gasped. She could not very well run after them, and grab Bobo's other arm. Indeed, while she stared speechless, the elevator door was closed, and she was whirled aloft. If looks could kill Jack had fallen dead in his tracks!
