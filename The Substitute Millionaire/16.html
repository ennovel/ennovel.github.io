In the character of Mr. Pitman he lunched with Dave Anderson nearly every day, and the intimacy between them ripened fast. After several invitations, Mr. Pitman finally allowed himself to be persuaded to visit Mr. Anderson's office.
<br> 
<br> They sat in the inner office with their cigars, and discussed crime in all its aspects.
<br> 
<br> "Anything—er—specially interesting on just now?" asked Mr. Pitman, with a look suggesting that he was not averse to hearing the most horrible details. Jack, under Evers' tuition had developed the character of Pitman to a high degree of artistry.
<br> 
<br> "No. The fact is I don't go after ordinary business any more; don't have to. I only have one case, so to speak, and that keeps me on Easy street. All I have to do is sit here and take the money.
<br> 
<br> "What a cinch! What kind of case is it?"
<br> 
<br> "Did you notice the name on the door?"
<br> 
<br> "Eureka Protective Association. Whom do you protect?"
<br> 
<br> "Millionaires!"
<br> 
<br> Thereupon Jack had to submit to hearing again what a fine concern Eureka was, what a benefit it conferred on the public, etc., etc. Though Anderson was at his ease with his friend, he told it all as seriously as before; there was no suggestion of a tongue in his cheek. Jack listened with well-assumed interest, hoping to get some real light on the subject later.
<br> 
<br> "How did you get into it in the first place?" he asked.
<br> 
<br> "Dumb luck!" said Anderson. "I'll tell you all about it some day."
<br> 
<br> Jack, fearful of spoiling everything by a display of eagerness, let the matter drop for the present. Fate presently rewarded his discretion.
<br> 
<br> "I haven't a thing to do this afternoon," said Anderson. "And you said you weren't busy. Let's go out and have a drink."
<br> 
<br> Mr. Pitman did not refuse, of course. They went and had their drink, and had another, and in the course of the afternoon Anderson's tongue was gradually unloosed, and the whole story came out.
<br> 
<br> "It was three years ago it started. I was doing a general detective business, and just barely making out, week by week. It was the time that big millionaire Ames Benton was killed by anarchists; remember?"
<br> 
<br> Jack nodded. He had a feeling that the loose ends of his case were now beginning to draw together.
<br> 
<br> "One day an oldish gentleman called at my office," Anderson went on, "a decent, respectable body, that you would expect to see coming out of church on Sunday morning. His hair was fixed in an old-fashioned way, sort of brushed forward of his ears like, and he wore a heavy mustache and neat little goatee or imperial."
<br> 
<br> Jack had the pleasant feeling that he was getting "warm" as children say in their game. They were sitting in an alcove of a saloon under the elevated railway, and he was glad of the semi-gloom of the place that prevented Anderson from seeing his face too clearly.
<br> 
<br> "He didn't give me his name," Anderson went on, "in fact I don't know it to this day. I just call him 'Mr. B.' He told me right off the bat that he was an anarchist, and I was a bit startled, noticing the little black satchel he carried. I remarked that he didn't gee with my idea of a Red, and he explained that he was disguised. So I don't even know what he looks like naturally."
<br> 
<br> "He went on to tell me that he had experienced what he called a change of heart—sort o' got religion you understand. The murder of Mr. Benton had sickened him, he said, and now he was anxious to do something to make up for the harm he had caused."
<br> 
<br> "He let on that he was one of the leading Reds of the country, a kid of supreme grand master with the entrée to every lodge. He said he wasn't going to betray any of his comrades, but that with my help, if I was willing, he would draw their teeth, so to speak, by giving warning to their intended victims.
<br> 
<br> "Well, I wasn't in a philanthropic mood myself, being as I had so much trouble already to make ends meet, and I didn't want to invite trouble with the Reds or anybody else, so at first I was cool to his scheme. But as he talked on I began to wake up to the possibilities.
<br> 
<br> "Well, sir, we began to dope out the scheme of Eureka right then, or rather, he doped it out and I listened with big ears. He had it all thought out before he came. When he talked about getting all the millionaires to subscribe for personal protection, I saw a happy future opening up. The best of it was, it was absolutely bona fide, and on the level; we really had something to sell them, for my friend, as I say, had the entrée to every anarchistic circle in the country, and was prepared to furnish me with full information of any plot they laid against a rich man."
<br> 
<br> "The only thing we stuck on was the division of the proceeds. He demanded seventy-five per cent. I tried to laugh him down—but it didn't get across. He wasn't a man you could get gay with. He had an eye that fixed you like a brad-awl.
<br> 
<br> "'You forget,' he said, 'that I'm the one who supplies the essential thing. I could get any one of a hundred detective agencies for the rest.'
<br> 
<br> "I tried to bluff him a bit. 'Not after you've opened it to me,' I said. 'I could queer it!'
<br> 
<br> "'You won't do that,' he said very quiet. And, by Gad, when he fixed me with those eyes, I thought of a dozen horrible deaths I might die, and I knew that I couldn't split on him if I wanted to. A wonderful man. In the end I had to accept his hard terms.
<br> 
<br> "Well, that's all. From the start it worked like a charm. With the horrible death of Ames Benton fresh in their minds, the millionaires fell all over themselves to subscribe for protection. We started at a moderate figure, and gradually jacked up their dues. You'd open your eyes if I told you the amount of money that passes through this little office every month."
<br> 
<br> "Give me an idea," said Jack.
<br> 
<br> "That's something I'll never tell any man," said Anderson with a slightly drunken leer.
<br> 
<br> "Do you only operate in the city here?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes. He may have other agencies outside. He may have other agencies right here in town for all I know. It was part of our agreement that I was to approach nobody except the men whose names he furnished. I haven't all the millionaires on my books by a long sight."
<br> 
<br> "Do you mean to tell me you've been in business with this man for three years and don't even know his right name?"
<br> 
<br> "It's a fact, and what's more I've never laid eyes on him from that day to this."
<br> 
<br> "Come off!" said Jack incredulously.
<br> 
<br> "It's a fact, I tell you. It stands to reason, don't it, that he couldn't be seen around here?"
<br> 
<br> "You could meet him outside."
<br> 
<br> "Too risky. If the other anarchists got on to his connection with me, his life wouldn't be worth a plugged nickel!"
<br> 
<br> "But you know where he lives?"
<br> 
<br> Anderson shook his head.
<br> 
<br> "Then how do you send him his share of the proceeds?"
<br> 
<br> "I send it in cash on a certain day every week. I put it in an envelope together with a statement of the week's business, and send it to a name and address previously furnished me that day over the 'phone. It's always different. Generally to a hotel, to be called for. I send it by messenger."
<br> 
<br> "Have you never had the curiosity to follow up the messenger?"
<br> 
<br> "No, sir! I've learned that it's healthier for me to follow instructions. I get my instructions over the 'phone, and by Gad! if they're not carried out to the letter he knows it, and I soon know it from him!"
<br> 
<br> "He must be a wonderful man."
<br> 
<br> "He's a marvel! Say it scares you like, the way he knows things. He tells me everything to do: who to see and how to approach him; how to follow him up. And everything always turns out just the way he says. It's like magic!"
<br> 
<br> Anderson's talk got a little muzzy, and drifted away to other subjects. A perfunctory attention was all he required and Jack's brain was free to ponder on what he had heard. He believed Anderson's story in the main. Incredible as it had seemed beforehand, he no longer doubted that Anderson was an innocent tool in the affair—at least comparatively innocent. The great sums he was making had no doubt helped to quiet an inquiring mind. When one is anxious not to discover an unpleasant fact, one may very easily remain in ignorance of it through all.
<br> 
<br> It began to look as if the decent little gentleman with the goatee was the guiding spirit in the whole scheme. Jack had made a long step forward in his investigation, but he now found himself opposed by an intelligence of the first class; one before whom Jack's youth and inexperience might well falter a little. He marvelled at the cunning with which the principal used innocent men to further his criminal projects. Apparently he had built up a highly organized business of blackmail, with various departments all working independently of each other. And he gathered up all strings in his own hands.
