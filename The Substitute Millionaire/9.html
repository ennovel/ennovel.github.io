Jack wanted to secure Mr. Delamare's approval for his new plans. For obvious reasons he did not care to take Bobo to the bank, so he called up the financier, and asked him respectfully if he would mind coming to the hotel.
<br> 
<br> A laugh answered him over the wire. "Would I mind! My dear boy! A banker would go to Tallapoosa to oblige a customer with an account like yours!"
<br> 
<br> While they waited for him they breakfasted in the Dutch room. Bobo's appetite showed no evil effects resulting from his scare of the night before. During the meal the card of a visitor was brought them.
<br> 
<br> 
<br> H. J. WHIGHAM
<br> The Eureka Protective Association
<br> 
<br> 
<br> "Ha!" cried Jack. "Exactly according to schedule!"
<br> 
<br> "What's that?" asked Bobo.
<br> 
<br> "Last night we got the rough stuff, to-day the smooth."
<br> 
<br> "I don't understand."
<br> 
<br> "Keep your ears open, and you'll see. Just let your little secretary deal with this gent for you."
<br> 
<br> Jack asked that Mr. Whigham be sent up. A old-young man was shown into them, a starched and ironed little fellow with an air of self-importance like a cock-sparrow's.
<br> 
<br> "If this is a dangerous crook," thought Jack, "he's got a dam clever line of comedy. Looks like a neck-tie clerk."
<br> 
<br> "Mr. Norman?" inquired the newcomer with a bird-like quirk of the head from one to another.
<br> 
<br> Jack waved his hand in Bobo's direction.
<br> 
<br> "Mr. Norman, I have a proposition to make to you."
<br> 
<br> "My secretary will talk to you," said Bobo with the drawl he now affected.
<br> 
<br> He went on with his breakfast and the reading of the newspaper—but missed nothing of what was said. Jack had been well-advised in keeping from him that there was any connection between Mr. Whigham and the Red Gang. Bobo could scarcely have maintained that air of nonchalance, had he known it.
<br> 
<br> "What can we do for you?" asked Jack politely "Excuse me if I go on with my breakfast. We were up late last night."
<br> 
<br> "Don't mention it," said Mr. Whigham. "I am early. I came early on purpose, because I thought later you would be besieged by cranks and triflers of all kinds. I have a genuine proposition to make Mr. Norman. It is one I felt ought to get to him without a moment's delay."
<br> 
<br> "Open it."
<br> 
<br> Mr. Whigham talked smoothly, and at considerable length. It had the effect of something well-rehearsed. Jack, as we know, had it all beforehand. Only the essential parts of his spiel need be given.
<br> 
<br> "Both of you gentlemen are no doubt aware of the great increase of anarchistic activity in this country of recent years."
<br> 
<br> At the word "anarchistic" Bobo started, and let the newspaper sink to the table.
<br> 
<br> "The police of this and other cities have worked hard to check this evil. They watch the Reds as well as they are able; close up their meeting-places—when they find them; arrest them on the least shadow of evidence. This is all right as far as it goes—understand, gentlemen, I am not knocking the police; but the fact remains that the horrible outrages continue. I need not speak of the latest one which concerns Mr. Norman so closely."
<br> 
<br> "The police method is like treating an ulcer with external applications only. You may heal it up, but it will only break out in another place. Now the Eureka Association was formed three years ago to deal with the matter from another angle. Not in opposition to the police, nor in alliance with them, but quite independently. We never inform on the Reds nor prosecute them."
<br> 
<br> "You make friends with them?" suggested Jack.
<br> 
<br> "In a way, yes. Our agents become Reds; join their circles, watch them, and report to the main office as to the plots they hatch. Our organization has now been brought to such a point of perfection that we are in a position to guarantee our subscribers absolute immunity from the attacks of anarchists."
<br> 
<br> "Was the late Mr. Gyde a member?" Jack asked slyly.
<br> 
<br> "He was not," said Mr. Whigham significantly. "He had rejected our respectful solicitations from time to time. Nevertheless out of pure humanity we warned him of what was about to occur. With characteristic obstinacy he ignored the warning—well, you know what happened."
<br> 
<br> "But they say that Emil Jansen, his assailant, was not a member of any regular circle."
<br> 
<br> "'They say!'" said Mr. Whigham sarcastically. "What do 'they' know!"
<br> 
<br> "What's the damage?" asked Jack.
<br> 
<br> "Hey?" said Mr. Whigham.
<br> 
<br> "What does the service cost?"
<br> 
<br> "Five hundred dollars a month."
<br> 
<br> Jack whistled. "There's nothing small about you."
<br> 
<br> Mr. Whigham earnestly pointed out the tremendous expenses attached to the association, including enormous salaries paid to the special agents to recompense them for the risks they ran.
<br> 
<br> "Why did you say you wanted to get to us without loss of time?"
<br> 
<br> "We are informed that a plot is already hatching against Mr. Norman. The Reds aim to make a spectacular double play by getting Mr. Gyde's successor."
<br> 
<br> Bobo gasped and looked imploringly at Jack.
<br> 
<br> "And if Mr. Norman pays up the five hundred you'll give the plot away?" Jack suggested dryly.
<br> 
<br> "No, sir," was the instant reply. "My instructions are to give you what information we have in any case. The Eureka is something more than a sordid money-making concern. It supplies a real service to the community. For a reference I am instructed to give you the name of Mr. Walter Delamare, who is well-known to you."
<br> 
<br> "Hm!" thought Jack. "This scheme is even cleverer than I expected." Aloud he asked: "What is the information you have?"
<br> 
<br> "That a man will be waiting this morning to attack Mr. Norman on the steps of the New York National Bank. Mr. Norman is advised not to visit Mr. Delamare's office for the time being."
<br> 
<br> "Good God!" said Bobo.
<br> 
<br> "What is your pleasure in the matter?" Jack asked Bobo with a respectful air.
<br> 
<br> "Oh, pay him! Pay him!" was the agitated reply.
<br> 
<br> A pleased faraway look appeared in Mr. Whigham's eye. He was evidently figuring on how he would spend his commission.
<br> 
<br> "Will you sign a check?" asked Jack.
<br> 
<br> Jack and Bobo went into the next room, and presently returned with a check, which was handed to Mr. Whigham. That little gentleman received it with thanks, and bowing, left with a promise to send "the contracts" around as soon as they could be made out.
<br> 
<br> Jack fell into a study.
<br> 
<br> "What do you make of it all?" Bobo asked helplessly.
<br> 
<br> "I may be wrong," said Jack slowly, "but my guess is that Whigham has a nice little wife and baby, and lives in a semi-detached with a neat back yard in Bayonne. I believe he is a member of the men's bible class and the Y.M.C.A., and is in every way a decent little citizen without a suspicion of the real nature of the devilish business he is engaged in. We'll have to look a long way past him for the principal."
<br> 
<br> "Devilish business!" repeated Bobo. "Don't—don't you believe what he said about the Reds being after you—I mean me, and all?"
<br> 
<br> "Not a word! Though I think the worthy little man believed it himself."
<br> 
<br> "But all that—about the man waiting on the bank steps?"
<br> 
<br> "Stage-stuff. Everybody read in the papers that Mr. Delamare was Silas Gyde's executor. A safe guess that you'd be likely to go to his office to-day. It was just a stall. As a matter of fact, we weren't going anyway. Mr. Delamare is coming here."
<br> 
<br> "Just the same, I wouldn't go—not for all you've offered me!" said Bobo fervently.
<br> 
<br> "Sure, that's where the pull of the scheme comes in. Look at it reasonably. If the anarchists really meant to croak a millionaire for the good of humanity, as their letter suggested, would they warn him with a letter? Not on your life! Those letters were simply to pave the way for Whigham. But the beauty of the scheme, the novelty of it, lies in the fact that Whigham is not in the secret. They use an innocent little Sunday-school teacher to collect their tribute!"
<br> 
<br> "Then you think there's no danger?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, danger enough if we had refused to fork out. There was danger in it for Silas Gyde."
<br> 
<br> "Well, I'm mighty glad we paid!"
<br> 
<br> "Sure! Now let me think. This matter will stand a lot of doping out."
<br> 
<br> They soon began to experience the full effects of newspaper publicity. A crowd of newspaper reporters, solicitors, cranks, high-toned beggars, besieged the hotel, and in every delivery arrived a stack of letters a foot high.
<br> 
<br> The hotel management designated its most experienced bellboy to wait upon them exclusively. This youth, Ralph by name, was smart and good-looking, but he had too knowing an eye. His knowledge of life, particularly of the seamy side of life, was disconcerting. Jack felt impelled to warn Bobo to be guarded in Ralph's presence. Jack decided they would have to forego the luxury of personal servants. The danger of the betrayal of their secret was too great.
<br> 
<br> After schooling Bobo for the ordeal, Jack had the reporters up-stairs, but excluded photographers. Bobo acquitted himself well enough in the interviews that followed. True he turned to Jack for aid at every other question, but there was nothing in itself suspicious that the newly-made millionaire seemed to be of a soft and dependent character. Jack could see the eyes of the reporters turn on himself enviously. They seemed to be saying:
<br> 
<br> "Gee! This guy has fallen into a good thing! He runs the show!"
<br> 
<br> Mr. Delamare arrived in company with Hugh Brome, Jack's lawyer, and the reporters were politely ushered out. Bobo was introduced to the newcomers, and Jack explained the part he was to play. They stared—then they laughed.
<br> 
<br> "Is it all right?" asked Jack anxiously. "Do you approve?"
<br> 
<br> "You're keeping the check signing privilege in your own hands I assume," said Mr. Delamare.
<br> 
<br> "Certainly."
<br> 
<br> "Well, as your banker that's all I'm concerned with. As your friend I may say I think it's a good scheme. You will have a close, outside view of a millionaire's life that will be of inestimable service to you when you have to take up that life."
<br> 
<br> Jack told him of the call of the Eureka Protective Association's representative, and mentioned that his, Mr. Delamare's name, had been offered as a reference.
<br> 
<br> The banker smote his palm with his fist. "By Gad! it's a fact!" he said. "I had forgotten all about it. I subscribed three years ago, after poor Ames Benton's death when we were all scared, and I suppose the payments have been going on ever since by my orders. At the time I thought the scheme was on the square, and I have never thought about it since. But they didn't tax me anything like as much as you. I suppose their ideas were more modest at the beginning. I must put a stop to my contributions."
<br> 
<br> "Wouldn't it be better to wait until I have looked into the thing?" said Jack.
<br> 
<br> Delamare shook his head decisively. "I can't stand for anything like that."
<br> 
<br> Having obtained the approval of his banker and his lawyer for his plans, Jack felt encouraged to go ahead. As Delamare and Brome were leaving Jack said:
<br> 
<br> "Can either of you put me in touch with a high police official, a man I can apply to in case of need?"
<br> 
<br> "I know the third deputy commissioner," said Delamare. "I'll give you a note to him."
<br> 
<br> When Jack and Bobo started out on the automobile buying expedition they left the Madagascar by the front door.
<br> 
<br> "The back door must be saved for emergencies," said Jack. "We'll have to get used to running the gauntlet."
<br> 
<br> However since no photographs had yet been published they were not generally recognized in the lobby. They only had one encounter. That was in that well-known cross corridor behind the lobby, where under the softly shaded lights amidst tropical verdure lovely ladies await their companions for luncheon and tea. As Bobo and Jack passed through one of these, a really dazzling creature in an ermine cape jumped up from her fauteuil.
<br> 
<br> "Mr. Norman!" she cried, addressing Bobo. "I'm sure I can't be mistaken!"
<br> 
<br> Bobo fell back in dismay. Jack looked on with a twinkle. It was not up to him to rescue his partner. The lady was of that highly-finished type that defies time—for a long time. She might have been twenty-eight or thirty-eight. For furs, millinery and hairdressing one couldn't see much of the woman God made, except a pair of big blue eyes, the whites slightly discolored from make-up. Her clothes outstyled style—but all was in good taste. It looked like the real thing.
<br> 
<br> "I am Clara Birmingham that was," she went on. "Don't you remember me?"
<br> 
<br> "I—I can't say I do," stammered Bobo ungallantly.
<br> 
<br> She laughed charmingly. "Well, it's not surprising, since we were both children when I used to visit Cartonsville. I recognized you from your likeness to your mother. You must come to see me. I am Mrs. Anson Cleaver now. You'll find me in the 'phone book. By the way, I'm having some people in to-night for music. Can't you come?"
<br> 
<br> "I'm afraid I—I—Mr. Robinson and I have an engagement."
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Cleaver turned inquiringly towards Jack.
<br> 
<br> "Mr. Robinson, my secretary," explained Bobo.
<br> 
<br> "Bring him with you. I should be charmed!"
<br> 
<br> With that she sailed away.
<br> 
<br> As soon as she was out of sight Bobo became very bold and looked at Jack with a doggish air, as much as to say: "That's the way to handle them!" But Jack laughed, and he wilted rather.
<br> 
<br> "Can we go to-night?" he asked meekly.
<br> 
<br> "Oh, you want to go now."
<br> 
<br> "It would be sport, wouldn't it?"
<br> 
<br> "Well, I'll see."
<br> 
<br> Later he went into a booth and called up Mr. Delamare.
<br> 
<br> "This is Robinson," he said.
<br> 
<br> "Robinson?" came the puzzled reply.
<br> 
<br> "Mr. Norman's secretary."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, of course!" with a laugh. "What can I do for you?"
<br> 
<br> "I come to you in every difficulty."
<br> 
<br> "That's as it should be. What now?"
<br> 
<br> "Did you ever hear of a lady called Mrs. Anson Cleaver?"
<br> 
<br> "Surely! Everybody has heard of Mrs. Cleaver. It's easy to see you don't read the society columns."
<br> 
<br> "She's the real thing, then."
<br> 
<br> "Well—not quite. Owing to the publicity she gets, she passes in the mind of the public as one of our leaders. But they say she has rather a strangely assorted crowd at her house, and conservative ladies—like Mrs. Delamare, are a little, what shall I say, leery of her. Nothing against her reputation you understand, but she's considered a little too spectacular in her methods."
<br> 
<br> "She made out to recognize Bobo from his likeness to my mother, and asked us to a musicale to-night. I thought she was a crook."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, hardly that! That was only a ladies' lie. Perfectly justifiable under the circumstances."
<br> 
<br> "What circumstances?"
<br> 
<br> "My dear fellow! You forget the éclat of a hundred millions! Think what a drawing card you—I mean Bobo—will be at her entertainments. She intends to be the first to exhibit him."
<br> 
<br> "Then you think it will be all right for us to go?"
<br> 
<br> "Why not? It will be amusing—and it can't very well do you any harm."
<br> 
<br> Just the same when Jack hung up the receiver a doubt remained in his mind. "How did it happen she picked on Bobo with such certainty?" he wondered. "No photograph has been published."
<br> 
<br> There followed a delightful orgy of spending during which Jack threw off all cares. The whole of automobile row from Fiftieth street to Seventy-second seemed to have been forewarned of their coming, and their progress was like a triumphal procession. The sleek, exquisite, expensive cars were put through their paces like willing slaves awaiting a master. Failing to agree on a type they bought both Jack's dashing roadster and Bobo's Imperial limousine.
<br> 
<br> They spent several hours with a millionaire's tailor, Bobo with ecstatic eyes like a dreamer, choosing suit after suit. Finally they purchased the best ready-made outfit obtainable for the party that night.
