At the end of two months Ruth Patton sent for her mother, who was feeling very lonely at Port Jervis, and engaged a suite of three rooms over those occupied by Mrs. Fenton and Fred. Though she was away during the day, the two ladies, living so near together, were company for each other. Ruth had now become advanced to twelve dollars a week, not out of charity, but because Alfred Lindsay's business had considerably increased and gave his copyist more to do.</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Fred was still on the Erie road, but it was now winter, and the travel had so much diminished that where he had formerly earned seven or eight dollars a week he now averaged no more than four. He began to be dissatisfied, for his income now was inadequate to meet his expenses, and he had been obliged to spend twenty dollars out of the two hundred which he had received from Mr. Lawrence at Niagara Falls. He was now seventeen, and he felt that it was high time he had entered upon some business in which he could advance by successive steps. On the road, if he remained till he was thirty years of age, he could earn no more than at present. He answered several advertisements, but secured nothing likely to be an improvement upon his present place.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 One evening toward the end of December he was about to leave the cars, when his attention was drawn to an old gentleman with hair nearly white, who did not rise with the rest of the passengers, but remained in his seat with his head leaned back and his eyes closed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The train boy, concluding that he had fallen asleep, went up to him and touched him gently.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We have reached Jersey City," he said.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The old man opened his eyes slightly and gazed at him bewildered.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I--I don't know where I am," he murmured vaguely.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You are in Jersey City, sir."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I want to go to New York."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You have only to cross the ferry."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Excuse me; I am a stranger here. I am from Ohio. Where is the ferry?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Let me lead you to the boat, sir."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The old man rose feebly and put his hand to his head.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I don't know what is the matter with me," he said. "I feel sick."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Perhaps you are upset by your journey. Come with me, and I will take care of you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You are a very good boy, and I will accept your offer."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He rose and left the car, leaning heavily on Fred's arm.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How long have you felt unwell?" asked the train boy sympathetically.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Ever since we left Elmira. My head troubles me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is the motion of the cars, no doubt. Here we are!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They were just in time to reach the boat. They entered the ladies' cabin, as Fred thought the tobacco smoke which always pervaded the cabin devoted to men would increase the old gentleman's head trouble.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Where do you wish to go when we have reached the New York side?" asked Fred, when they were nearly across the river.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have a nephew living on Madison Avenue. Do you know that street?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, yes, sir, very well. I will go up with you if you will let me know your nephew's name."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The name was mentioned, and to Fred's surprise was that of a wealthy and influential Wall Street broker. It was clear that the old gentleman, though plainly dressed, would not need to economize.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I think, sir," said Fred, noticing that the old man seemed to be getting more and more feeble, "that it will be well for you to take a cab, in order to avoid any walking. You seem very much fatigued."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You are right. Will you call one? I don't feel able."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "With pleasure, sir."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Fred passed through the gate and beckoned a hackman, who drove up with alacrity.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Where to, sir?" he asked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Fred gave the number on Madison Avenue.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Mr. John Wainwrignt lives there," said the hackman. "I sometimes drive him up from Wall Street."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That is the place. This is his uncle."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The hackman touched his hat respectfully to the old gentleman, whom he had at first mentally styled a rusty old codger. His relationship to the wealthy broker gave him dignity in the eyes of the driver.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Won't you get in too?" asked the old gentleman who had come to rely upon Fred as his guardian.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Certainly, sir."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I shall feel safer. I am a perfect stranger to the city."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He leaned back in the seat and partially closed his eyes.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The hack rattled through the streets and in due time reached its destination.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The hackman opened the door of the cab and Fred assisted the old gentleman to alight.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Take my pocketbook and pay him," said the old man.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The hackman did not venture to ask more than his rightful fare, as it would have come to the knowledge of the broker, whom he did not care to offend.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The driver paid, Fred ascended the steps and rang the bell.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A man servant opened the door.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Is Mr. Wainwright at home?" asked Fred.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The servant, seeing an old man in rather a rusty dress, was inclined to think that he was an applicant for charity, and answered rather superciliously:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, he's at 'ome, but I ain't sure as he'll see you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Tell him," said Fred sharply, "that his uncle has arrived."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "His uncle!" repeated the astounded flunkey. "O yes, sir, certainly, sir. I think he _is_ at 'ome. Won't you step in, sir?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Fred would have gone away, but the old gentleman still seemed to require his assistance, and he stepped in with him and led him into the drawing-room.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The servant promptly reported the arrival to Mr. Wainwright, who descended the staircase quickly and greeted his uncle.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You are heartily welcome, Uncle Silas," he said. "I did not expect you till to-morrow, or I would have sent the carriage for you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I changed my mind, John, and decided to push through."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Who is this young man with you?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He is a kind friend, John. I was taken sick--the effect of the journey, I think--and I shouldn't have been able to get up here but for him."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The broker smiled pleasantly and held out his hand to Fred.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You are the train boy, are you not?" he asked, glancing at Fred's cap.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, sir."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I hope you find it pays you well."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Not at this season, sir."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How long have you been in service?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Over a year."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Thank you for your kindness to my uncle. He seems ill and requires my attention now. Can you make it convenient to call here to-morrow evening at eight o'clock?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, sir. I will call with pleasure."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Good night, then, and don't forget to call."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The broker shook hands with Fred again, and the train-boy left the house quite won by the pleasant and affable manner of the great broker.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I never expected to know such a man as that," thought Fred. "I wish he would give me a position in his office. That would be much better worth having than my present place."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Why are you so late, Fred?" asked his mother, when he reached home.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I had to make a call on Mr. Wainwright, the broker," answered Fred.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I guess you are only funning," said Albert.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, I am not. I am invited to call again to-morrow evening."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What for?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Perhaps he's going to take me into partnership," said Fred in joke.
