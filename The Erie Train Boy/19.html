<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "My mother and I," she said, "in our grief for father's death, never dreamed that it would bring us destitution. Though he never furnished us particulars of his pecuniary condition, he gave us to understand that he would be comfortably provided for. Robert Ferguson we knew to have been a life-long friend, or perhaps I should rather say acquaintance, and we felt that as a trustee he would consider our interests. We were thunderstruck when a letter was received from him last week, stating that, in place of the ten thousand dollars on which we fully counted, a pitiful balance of seventy-five dollars alone remained to us."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It was shameful!" said Mrs. Fenton indignantly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Nearly all of this sum will be swallowed up by small debts due in Port Jervis. You will understand now why I have come to lay our case before Mr. Ferguson, and see if he cannot give us more, or at any rate find me employment, for on me now rests the duty of providing for my poor mother."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I wish I could encourage you, Miss Patton----"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Don't call me Miss Patton. I look upon yon as a kind friend, and hope you will call me Ruth."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "So indeed I will, for I feel a strong interest in you, Ruth."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And I will look to you for advice."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then I advise you to call this evening on Mr. Ferguson, and find out the worst."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Meanwhile perhaps you can direct me to a cheap boarding-house."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You will stay here till you have had time to form your plans."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I will gladly do so if you will let me pay you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "All in good time, Ruth. To-day you can help me if you will, and it will be time to pay board when you are earning something."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 It was not till he sat down to an early breakfast that Fred thought of the package handed him by Mr. Lawrence at the Niagara Falls station. He opened it in some curiosity, and to his surprise discovered a roll of bills, accompanied by this note:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 To FRED FENTON,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 MY YOUNG FRIEND:--Though I have not yet had a chance to communicate with my uncle in Elmira, I feel authorized to act as his representative, and in his name ask you to accept the inclosed sum as an acknowledgment of your valuable assistance in bringing about the recovery of the securities stolen from his house, and incidentally as a recompense for the annoyance you experienced in being yourself suspected. Your conduct has been very creditable, and I feel that to you we are largely indebted for the recovery of the property and the conviction of the burglar. I infer that you are mainly dependent, on your earnings, which are probably limited, and I therefore take pleasure in handing you a substantial reward which I hope will be of service to you.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Yours sincerely,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 EDMUND LAWRENCE.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Fred counted the bills, and alike to his surprise and gratification found that they amounted to two hundred dollars.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Where did you get so much money, Fred?" asked his mother, entering the room as he completed his count.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That letter will explain, mother," answered Fred radiant with delight.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We are indeed rich!" said Mrs. Fenton joyfully. "This removes all anxiety for a long time to come."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, we can afford to snap our fingers at the landlord."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I hope you are not going to carry all this money round with you, Fred. You might get robbed."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I shall deposit it in the Dime Savings Bank this forenoon."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But you will leave before the bank opens."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, I am to take a midday train."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 At ten o'clock Fred went to the Union Dime Savings Bank fronting on Thirty-Second Street, and deposited the hundred dollars in gold left him by his mining friend, and one hundred and seventy-five dollars besides from his recent gift. The other twenty-five he handed to his mother.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Mother," he said, "you need a new dress, and Albert needs a new suit. Take this money, and buy what you think best."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I can go a little longer without a dress, Fred."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But I don't want you to. We can spare the money well enough, and there is no better way to spend it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Mrs. Fenton made no further opposition, but during the day asked Ruth Patton to accompany her to one of the large stores on Sixth Avenue, where the necessary purchases were made.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 In the evening Ruth set out for her call upon Mr. Robert Ferguson.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She ascended the steps in a state of nervous agitation, for she felt that the interview was of momentous importance to her, and in a low voice asked the servant who answered the bell if she could see Mr. Ferguson.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I will ask, miss," said the servant, surveying her plain dress with some disdain.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "A young lady to see me?" said Robert Ferguson in surprise. "Are you sure it is not my daughter she wishes to see?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, sir; she expressly asked to see you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Mr. Ferguson was a widower, and rather vain of his personal attractions. Perhaps the young lady might have been struck by his appearance.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You can show her up," he said amiably, and turned to catch a further glance in a mirror just opposite. He straightened his necktie, and passed his hand softly over his hair to make sure that it was smooth, and then turned to the door to catch the first glimpse of his visitor.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Nothing thus far has been said of the outward appearance of Ruth Patton. Notwithstanding her anxious face she was unusually pretty, and her manners were refined and ladylike.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Mr. Ferguson?" she said inquiringly, pausing at the door.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Come in, my dear young lady!" said Robert Ferguson graciously. "I am pleased to see you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Thank you, sir."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Pray sit down."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He is much kinder than I supposed," thought Ruth. "I must have misjudged him."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I wrote to you a few days since," she began.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Indeed! I don't think I can have received your letter."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But you answered it, sir."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I answered a letter from you? What then is your name?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Ruth Patton."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh!" returned Ferguson, his face darkening. He no longer felt inclined to be gracious, for he had a premonition that the interview would not be agreeable to him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "My mother and I were quite overwhelmed by the news you sent us. We had no idea that my father left so little, and she wished me to come on and ask for some particulars."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have very little to tell you beyond what I wrote," said Mr. Ferguson coldly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "My father led us to think that we should be comfortably provided for."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Many men have very vague ideas of how they stand. Your father did wrong in not insuring his life."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He did not think it would be necessary. He thought we should be sufficiently provided for without that."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He had no right to think so," said Ferguson irritably. "You see how things have turned out."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But what can have become of all the money?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I hope, Miss Patton, you don't think I have spirited it away?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, sir. Don't be offended, but it seems so strange," faltered Ruth.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The money was unwisely invested. A large part of it was in wild-cat mining stocks, which were not worth the paper they were written on."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Father never spoke to us about any such investments."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I presume not. Most men keep such matters to themselves. Well, the upshot is that but seventy-five dollars are left. I presume your mother received my check for this amount."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, sir."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then that is all I can do for you. I will in time forward a bill of particulars. A present I am busy."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 At this moment Luella Ferguson entered the room. She recognized Ruth at once.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You here?" she said in haughty surprise.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, I came on business."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We do not want any servants. Papa, this girl was very insolent to me on the train yesterday. I hope you will send her away."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am going, Miss Ferguson," said Ruth with spirit. "Your father was the trustee of my poor father's property, and it was to ask about it that I came here. Good evening."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She left the house with faltering steps, for her last hope had been destroyed, and she felt keenly the cruel slight of Luella Ferguson. As she set foot on the sidewalk her brain reeled, and she would have fallen had not a young man who was about to ascend the steps sprung forward and supported her.
