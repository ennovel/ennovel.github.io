It was tantalizing to be so near the Falls, and yet to be locked up, and prevented from seeing them. Of course it would all come right in time, but it was hard to bear the suspense and confinement. Hunting round the room he found a juvenile book, and sitting down at the window read it. It helped to while away the time till twelve o'clock. He had scarcely read the last page when he heard the key turning in the lock outside. The door opened and two persons appeared at the entrance. One was the clerk the other a boy, rather short, with a bright, attractive face.</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I thought you might like company," said the clerk in a friendly manner. "This is my young cousin, Frank Hamblin, who will remain with yon for a while."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am glad to see you, Frank," said Fred offering his hand. "You are very kind to come and see a bold, bad burglar."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You don't look much like it," said Frank, laughing. "Still appearances are deceitful."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I don't think I look wicked," said Fred meditatively, as he glanced at his reflection in a small mirror that hung over the washstand. "Yet it appears that I have broken into a gentleman's house in Elmira, and stolen a gold watch and chain and some government bonds."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How could you do it?" asked Frank with much seriousness. "So young and yet so wicked!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That's the question that puzzles me," said Fred. "How could I do it when at the time the burglary was committed I was speeding over the Erie road at the rate of thirty miles an hour?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Can you prove this?" asked Frank eagerly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Certainly I could, if the conductor or brakeman of my car were here."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Where are they?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Probably on their way back to New York."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you live there?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have always wanted to see the city of New York. It must be a gay place."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You are right there, Frank. Whenever you do come, just inquire for Fred Fenton, and I will show you round. There is my address."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Thank you! I should like it ever so much. Have you ever been here before?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No. I wanted very much to see the Falls, but here I am locked up in a hotel chamber. I wish the Falls were visible from the window."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "They are on the other side of the house."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you know this detective--the one that searched me?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, I have seen him. I heard him tell my cousin that he did not believe you guilty, but that finding the watch and chain in your bundle was a suspicious circumstance."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I suppose it is. Now I can understand how innocent people get into trouble. Do you live here?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, I am only visiting some friends here. I live in Auburn."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That's where the State's prison is, isn't it?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then I hope I shan't go to Auburn to live. Have you any idea how long I shall have to stay here?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Till evening, I suppose. You will probably be brought before a justice in the morning," was Frank's reply.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Fred sighed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How differently things have turned out from what I anticipated," he said. "I expected to be walking round, and looking at the Falls to-day."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Hold on a minute!" said Frank. "Mr. Ferguson boards here, and he may be down-stairs now. I'll ask him if you can't go out under my charge if you'll promise not to run away.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I'll promise that fast enough. You can knock me down if I attempt to escape."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am afraid I might find that difficult, as you are at least two inches taller than I."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I will be very gentle and submissive. I wouldn't be willing to run away with such a suspicion hanging over me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Excuse me a minute! I'll do what I can for you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Frank went to the door and attempted to open it, but it was locked on the outside and resisted his efforts.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I forgot," he said, laughing, "that I am a prisoner too. Really it makes a fellow feel queer to be locked up."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That's the way I feel. You can ring the bell, can't you?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "A good thought!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Frank rang the bell, and presently a hall boy opened the door about an inch, and looked in.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Is anything wanted?" he asked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Is Mr. Ferguson down-stairs?" said Frank.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He has just come in."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Won't you ask him to step up here a minute?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "All right, sir."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The door was relocked, but two minutes later it was opened and the detective walked in.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Ha!" he said. "So we have two burglars instead of one."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am just as much a burglar as Fred is," said Frank.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then," said the detective with a smile, "I may feel it my duty to search you. You do have rather a hardened expression."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you think I have?" asked Fred smiling.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, no. I wouldn't pick you out for a professional criminal, and to be honest with you, I doubt whether you know anything of the burglary."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Thank you! I am glad you have a better opinion of me than that."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But what is it you want of me, Frank?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I want Fred to have a chance to see the Falls. He has never been here before, and it will be a great disappointment to him if he has to go away without seeing them."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "To be sure, to be sure!" said the detective thoughtfully.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I thought you might let him go out under my escort."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Mr. Ferguson smiled.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What could you do if he took it into his head to escape?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You couldn't lend me a club, could you?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I don't carry any. That is for policemen, and I have never acted in that capacity."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But he won't run away, will you, Fred?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, I prefer to stay here till I am cleared of suspicion."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You see, Mr. Ferguson," said Frank, eagerly, "there will be no risk about it. He can give you his _parole_--that's the word, isn't it?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes; but this privilege is never accorded to those who are arrested for burglary."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is certainly inconvenient to be a burglar," said Fred, smiling in spite of his secret anxiety.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then you can't let him go?" questioned Frank, regretfully.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, there is one way. I should not consider it safe to let him go with you, but I might accompany you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That will be capital! You will, won't you?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, I will," said Ferguson, after a momentary pause. "I have a boy of my own about the age of--the young burglar--and that perhaps inclines me to be more indulgent. But you must wait till after dinner."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Will dinner be sent up here?" asked Frank.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, for him; but you are not staying at the house."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I forgot; and I haven't got money enough to pay for a hotel dinner."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That's all right, Frank," said Fred. "I invite you to dine with me, and it shall be charged on my bill. I shall enjoy dinner better if I have company."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Thank you. I accept the invitation, but I don't like to be an expense to you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Never mind."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Dinner was sent up in the course of half an hour, and the two boys enjoyed it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Are you still attending school, Frank?" asked Fred.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I should like to, but poor boys like me have to work for a living."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "If you won't tell I will let you into a secret."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What is it?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am writing a long story. I want to be an author some time. I've written twenty chapters already."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You must be smart," said Fred in surprise. "Why, I couldn't write as much in a whole year."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Of course I can't tell whether it is good for anything, but some time I mean to write well."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, Frank, I wish you success, I am sure. Some day I may be proud to know you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Now I might write a story about you, and call it 'The Boy Burglar.'"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Don't! I have no wish to figure in that character."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Half an hour later the door opened, and the detective entered, dressed for a walk.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Now, if you two burglars are ready," he said, "we will take a stroll."&nbsp;
