<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I didn't notice. He registered before me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Suppose we look and see. It may be well to know."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They opened the hotel register, and saw written in a bold, free hand:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "F. GRANT PALMER, CHICAGO."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It may be another Fred," suggested Frank.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Or Frank. Either name would do for a burglar," said Mr. Ferguson, smiling. "But it is hardly consistent with professional etiquette to joke on such a subject. I will endeavor to forget while we are walking together that one of the party is an offender against the laws, or under suspicion as such."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I want to forget it myself," said Fred, "or it will spoil my enjoyment of Niagara."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I wonder where Mr. F. Grant Palmer is now," said Frank. "I feel sure he is the real burglar."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then he has probably gone over into Canada," returned Fred. "It is unlucky for me that he left the watch and chain, but lucky for Mr. Carver, who will now recover them."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Meanwhile let us follow Mr. Palmer, whose movements are of interest to us in connection with the suspicion he has managed to throw on Fred. When he left the Lynch House he proposed, as a measure of safety, to go over to the Canada side, and indeed he did so. He made his way to the Clifton House, and registered there, depositing his valise at the office while he went in to breakfast.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We have no room at present," said the clerk, politely, "but by the middle of the forenoon we shall undoubtedly have a few vacancies. Will that answer?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, yes," said Palmer easily. "I am in no special hurry for a room, but will take breakfast and go out for a walk."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 It did occur to Mr. Palmer that the valise, containing as it did the bonds stolen from Mr. Carver in Elmira, should be carefully guarded. However, it would surely be as safe in the care of the hotel clerk of the Clifton as in any hotel room, and probably even safer. So he ate breakfast with an easy mind, and then, purchasing a cigar, took a walk along the road which presents the best views of the Falls.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Mr. Palmer felt very complacent.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is a blessing to gentlemen in my profession," he soliloquized, "that Canada is so conveniently near. Here the minions of the law cannot touch us for any little indiscretion committed under the stars and stripes. I hear people talking of annexing Canada to the States, but to that I am unalterably opposed. I should have to retire from business, and I am not able to do that at present."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He was standing at a convenient point surveying the Falls, when he felt a light touch on his shoulder. Such was the force of habit that Mr. Palmer started violently, and turned round nervously.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 It was a stout man with a smiling face that confronted him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Ha, Palmer!" said the new arrival. "Did you mistake me for----"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How are you, Wellington? I am glad to see you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Instead of----"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, pshaw! A man naturally starts when he is tapped on the shoulder unexpectedly."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I see. You were admiring the Falls."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "There is a good deal of romance in your composition, my dear Palmer," said his friend banteringly. "Anything new?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, yes," said Palmer, glancing around him cautiously.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Made a strike, eh?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, something of the sort."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What is it?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I managed to have a stroke of luck at Elmira, yesterday afternoon."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How much did you get away with?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Hush! don't speak so plainly. Suppose any one should hear you?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "My dear fellow, there is no one within two hundred yards."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, there must be five thousand dollars in bonds and money."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Very neat, upon my word! You are in luck!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How about you?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I made a small raise at Buffalo--a paltry three hundred dollars' worth. It was hardly worth the trouble of taking. Still, a man must live."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "To be sure!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Now with what you picked up you can live a year or two in comfort. Upon my soul, I envy you. Are you suspected?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have managed to divert suspicion, I think;" and Palmer told his friend the story of his secreting the gold watch and chain in Fred's luggage.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Very shrewd!" said his friend approvingly. "Palmer, you are a credit to our profession. I shall be content to take lessons of you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, you are only joking," said Palmer, his expression showing, however, that he felt proud of the compliment.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They took a long and leisurely walk together, talking over their mutual experiences. They had known each other for ten years, having been fellow boarders together as far back as that at Sing Sing, since then neither had been caught, though both had been engaged in violating the laws. Their similar professions had given them a common bond of sympathy, and they found so much satisfaction in each other's company that the time slipped by insensibly, and it was half-past twelve before they found their way back to the Clifton.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Mr. Palmer stepped up to the desk.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Have you a room for me yet?" he inquired.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, sir; I can give you No. 67. Here, front!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A hall boy answered the summons.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Take the gentleman up to 67," said the clerk.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Any luggage, sir?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You may hand me my valise, if you please."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Beg pardon; here it is."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Come up with me, Wellington. We'll continue our talk up stairs."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Palmer merely glanced at the valise, and continued talking with his friend. The hall boy unlocked the door of No. 67 and led the way inside.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 It was a pleasant room, and Palmer looked about him approvingly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I shall be very comfortable here," he said.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Is everything right?" asked the hall boy, lingering.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Palmer smiled, drew a quarter from his pocket and put it into the ready hand of the young man.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You take American coins, don't you?" he asked with a smile.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, dear, yes, sir. Thank you!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That is all for the present. If I want anything I will ring."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Wellington scanned the valise with an eye of interest.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "So that holds the swag, does it?" he asked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "My dear friend, don't use such vulgar terms!" said Palmer reproachfully. "It's not only inelegant, but it's imprudent. Suppose anybody heard you?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Your reproof is just, Palmer. I am rather a blunderer, I admit. I see you are traveling under a false name."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What do you mean?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Wellington pointed to a small card attached to the valise. It bore the name of Edmund Lawrence.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When Palmer's glance fell on this card, a quick glance of dismay swept over his face.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That isn't my valise!" he said.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Not your valise!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No. The clerk has made a mistake. I must see him at once!" continued Palmer, in an agitated voice. "He may have given my valise to this man Lawrence, and in that case I am ruined. Stay here till I return."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Palmer seized the satchel, opened the door, and descended to the office in breathless haste. As he dashed up to the desk the clerk eyed him in mild surprise.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What is the matter?" he asked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Matter enough! You have given me the wrong valise."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Is it possible?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "See here; this belongs to a party named Lawrence--Edmund Lawrence. Give me mine at once."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The clerk looked troubled.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am afraid I can't," he faltered apologetically. "I gave Mr. Lawrence your valise--you will observe that they are very much alike--and he carried it away two hours since."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Palmer felt ready to drop. To think that after all his careful planning everything should be jeopardized by a hotel clerk's error.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you know what you have done?" he said, in a hollow voice. "My valise contained two thousand dollars' worth of securities."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am terribly sorry, Mr. Palmer, but I don't think you will suffer any loss. This Mr. Lawrence looks like a high-toned gentleman. You can see him within an hour. He went from here to the International Hotel on the American side of the Falls. I advise you to go over at once, take his bag with you, and exchange."
