He was glad to be back so early, as it gave him time to prepare for his evening visit. Naturally his mind had dwelt upon it more or less during the day, and he looked forward to the occasion with pleasant anticipations. The broker's gracious manners led Fred to think of him as a friend.</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I would like to be in the employ of such a man," he reflected.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He started from home in good season, and found himself on the broker's steps on the stroke of eight.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The door was opened by the same servant as on the evening previous, but he treated Fred more respectfully, having overheard Mr. Wainwright speak of him cordially.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 So when Fred asked, "Is Mr. Wainwright at home?" he answered "Yes, sir; come right in. I believe as you are expected."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The old man was descending the stairs as Fred entered, and immediately recognized him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Ha, my young friend!" he said. "I am glad to see you," and he held out his hand.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I hope you are feeling better, sir," said Fred respectfully.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, yes, thank you. I feel quite myself to-day. It was the length of the journey that upset and fatigued me. I couldn't travel every day, as you do."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, sir, I suppose not now; but when you were of my age it would have been different."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How old are you?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Seventeen."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And I am seventy-one, the same figures, but reversed. That makes a great difference. Come in here; my nephew will be down at once."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The train boy followed the old gentleman into the handsome drawing-room, and sat down on a sofa feeling, it must be owned, not quite as much at home as he would have done in a plainer house.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Did you make much to-day?" asked Silas Corwin (that was his name) in a tone of interest.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, sir, it was a poor day. I only sold three dollars' worth."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And how much did that yield you?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Sixty cents. I have a commission of twenty per cent."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What was the most you ever made in a day?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I took in thirteen dollars once--it was on a holiday."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That would give you two dollars and sixty cents."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, sir."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Very good indeed!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "If I could keep that up I should feel like a millionaire."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Perhaps happier than a millionaire. I have known millionaires who were weighed down by cares, and were far from happy."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Fred listened respectfully, but like most boys of his age found it impossible to understand how a very rich man could be otherwise than happy.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 At this point Mr. John Wainwright entered the room.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Good evening, my boy!" he said cordially. "I won't apologize for being late, as my uncle has no doubt entertained you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, sir; he was just telling me that millionaires are sometimes unhappy."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And you did not believe him?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I think I should be happy if I were worth a million."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You might feel poorer than you do now. I knew a millionaire once--a bachelor--who did not venture to drink but one cup of coffee at his breakfast (he took it at a cheap restaurant) because it would involve an added expenditure of five cents."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Was he in his right mind, sir?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I don't wonder you ask. I don't think a man who carries economy so far is quite in his right mind. However, he was shrewd enough in his business transactions. But now tell me something about yourself. Are you alone in the world?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, sir; I have a mother and little brother."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Are they partly dependent upon you?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, sir."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Can you make enough to support them comfortably?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I can in the summer, sir, but in the winter my earnings are small."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How small?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Not over four dollars a week."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That is certainly small. Do you like your present employment?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am getting tired of it," answered Fred. "I should be glad to find a place where I can have a chance to rise, even if the pay is small."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What do you think of going into a broker's office?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Fred's heart gave a bound.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I should like it very much," he said.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then I think I can offer you a place in mine. Come down on Saturday, and I will introduce you to the office employees, and on Monday you can begin work."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am very much obliged to you, Mr. Wainwright."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Before you know how much pay you are to receive?" asked the broker, smiling.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I can safely trust that to you, sir."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then we will say eight dollars to begin with."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "My mother will be pleased with my good luck. I hope I shall prove satisfactory."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We generally ask references from those about to enter our employment, but my uncle here insists that it is unnecessary in your case."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I'll go security for the boy, John," said Silas Corwin.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Thank you, sir," said Fred. "I will see that you don't run any risk."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 At this moment a young girl of fourteen entered the room. She was the picture of rosy health, and Fred looked at her admiringly. She, too, glanced at him curiously.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Fred, this is my daughter, Rose," said Mr. Wainwright.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Is this the boy who came home with Uncle Silas?" asked the young lady.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, Rose."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He looks like a nice boy."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Fred blushed at the compliment, but coming from such lips he found it very agreeable.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Thank you," he said.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How old are you?" continued Rose. "I'm fourteen."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am three years older."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "When I am three years older I shall be a young lady."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I don't think I shall ever be a young lady," said Fred demurely.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Why, of course you won't, you foolish boy," said Rose, with a merry laugh. "Papa, may I invite Fred to my New Year's party?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, if you like."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You'll come, won't you?" asked Rose.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "If your father approves," answered Fred, hesitating.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Of course he does. Didn't he say so? If you'll tell me where you live, I'll send you a card. Do you dance?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Not much; but I will practise beforehand."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That's right. You must dance with me, you know."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Rose," said her father gravely, "are you under the impression that this is Leap Year? You seem to be very attentive to this young man."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Rose was the pride of her father's heart, as she might well be, for she was an unusually attractive child, and had been a good deal indulged, but by no means spoiled. Mr. Wainwright had no foolish ideas about exclusiveness, and was not disturbed by his daughter's cordiality to Fred.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you play backgammon, Fred?" asked Rose, after some further conversation.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, a little."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then I'll get the backgammon board, and we'll have a game."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Fred was not a skilful player, and the young lady beat him three games in succession, which put her in high spirits. Her favorable opinion of Fred was confirmed, and when he rose to go she pressed him to come again.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Thank you," said Fred, "I shall be very glad indeed to come."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Rose," said her father, after Fred's departure, "it seems to me you have been flirting with Fred."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He's a nice boy, don't you think so, papa?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I hope he will prove so, for I am going to take him into my office."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That's good. Then I shall see him often."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Really, Rose, I was a little alarmed lest you should make him an offer this evening."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You needn't be afraid, papa. I will wait till I am a little bit older."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And then shall you offer yourself to Fred?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Perhaps I shall if I don't see any one I like better."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You must remember he is poor."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That doesn't make any difference. You can give us all the money we want."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "A very satisfactory arrangement, upon my word! I am glad you don't insist upon getting married at once, but give me a few hours to get reconciled to the thought."&nbsp;
