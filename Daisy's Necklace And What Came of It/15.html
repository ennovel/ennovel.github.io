 There is not a pleasanter place in the world for a summer residence than Blackwell's Island! The chief edifices are substantial, and the grounds are laid out with exceeding care. The water-scape is delightfully invigorating, and the sojourners at this watering-place are not of that transient class which one finds at Nahant, Newport, and other pet resorts. Indeed, it is usual to spend from six to eight months on the "Island," and one has the advantage of contracting friendships which are not severed at the first approach of the "cold term"--for the particulars of which "cold term," see that funny old savant of Brooklyn Heights, who has a facetious way of telling us that it has been raining, after the shower is over.--Bless him! Such institutions as "Blackwell's Island" are godsends to the literati. A poor devil of an author, who has a refined taste for suburban air, but whose finances preclude his dreaming of Nahant, has only to mix himself up in a street fight, or some other interesting city episode, to be entitled to a country-seat at the expense of his grateful admirers! Owing to a little oversight on his part, the author of this veracious history took a passage for "Blackwell's Island" a trifle earlier in the season than he had anticipated; and it is at that delightful region these pages are indited. But the Tombs--heaven save us from that! There are many pleasanter places in New-York than the Tombs; for that clumsy piece of Egyptian architecture--its dingy marble walls, its nail-studded doors and sickening atmosphere--is uncommonly disagreeable as a dwelling. Many startling tragedies have been enacted there--scenes of eternal farewells and lawful murders. I could not count on my fingers the number of men who have entered its iron gates full of life, and come out cold, still and dreadful! It was here that Mortimer was brought. Within, all was sombre and repulsive. Without, there was hum of voices, and the frosty rails which ran in front of the prison creaked dismally as the heavy freight cars passed over them; but these sounds of life were not heard inside. The cell of Mortimer and its occupants, the morning after his arrest, presented a scene of gloomy picturesqueness. Through a grated window, some six feet from the stone floor, a strip of sunshine came and went, falling on Mortimer, who leaned thoughtfully against the damp wall. The room, if we may call it one, was devoid of furniture, with the exception of a low iron bedstead, whose straw-stuffed mattress and ragged coverlid suggested anything but sleep. Daisy Snarle was standing with downcast eyes near the door which a few minutes before had closed on its creaking hinges, and outside of which the jailor stood listening. The long, dark lashes were resting on her cheek; the pearls of the necklace, which gleamed here and there in the queenly braid, looked whiter by contrast with Daisy's chestnut hair. In one hand she had gathered the folds of her shawl, the other hung negligently at her side. From beneath the skirt of her simple dress, peeped one of the loveliest feet ever seen, and her whole attitude was unconsciously exquisite. She had just ceased speaking, and the faintest possible tinge of crimson was on her cheeks. "Daisy, you are one of God's good angels, or you would never have come to me in this repulsive place." Daisy's eyes were still bent on the floor. "Speak to me again, Daisy," said Mortimer, taking her hand. "Your voice gives me heart, and your words make me forget everything but you." Daisy lifted her dreamy hands, and said, softly:--"They could not find it." "Could not find what, Daisy?" "The necklace," said Daisy, smiling. "No," she continued, in a low, musical voice, "they searched in all the rooms, in all the trunks--turned over your papers and mother's work-basket--but they could not find it." And Daisy smiled again. "Where was it, Daisy?" "Here!" And Daisy, smiling all the while, lifted Mortimer's hand in hers, and placed it on the braid of hair. Mortimer started. "O, Daisy! Daisy! why did you do that?" The little foot tapped gently on the stone floor. "Because," said Daisy, dropping her eyes, "because, when I read your note yesterday, I doubted you for a moment: but when I looked at the portrait in your room, I believed you; and I hid the necklace in my hair, and came to ask your pardon." "Let any misfortune come to me, darling!" said Mortimer, touched with this ingenious act, "let come what will, I am strong! As sure as little Bell looks down from Heaven, you do not wear a stolen necklace. How it came into my hands I cannot tell, without wronging the dead. But, Daisy, it was imprudent for you to run this risk." "Oh, no; they hunted for something hidden, and could not see what was before their eyes," replied Daisy, giving a quick, low laugh, and then she grew thoughtful again. "But if they had seen it, Daisy?" "Well." "You would have been implicated in this unhappy affair to your certain ruin, without benefiting me. You must leave the necklace here." "But I won't!" This time the pretty little foot was set firmly on the flagging. The jailor, who had been an attentive listener to the foregoing conversation, thrust his hands into the capacious pockets of his overcoat with the bearing of a man who is completely satisfied. "I knowed it," he said, emphatically; "the boy is misfortunate somehow, and the young girl's a trump--she is. Lord help 'em! But time's up, and I must stop their talk." With this the man tapped on the door. Mortimer held Daisy in his arms for a moment, and then sat down on the bed. Daisy was gone, and it seemed as if the sunlight had gone with her, the cell grew so gloomy to the prisoner. "Young man," said the jailor, with a solemn look, "the young lady is very unprudent to go circumventing round with that necklace twisted up on the top ov her skull--she is." Mortimer groaned. "You heard all, then, and you will betray us!" "Part ov what you say is true," returned the man, bluntly, "and part isn't. I heard yer talk, but my name isn't Joe Wilkes ef I blow on yer!" Mortimer looked at the ruddy, honest face of Joe Wilkes, and gave him his hand. "I believe you, my good man." That individual appeared to be turning something over in his mind which refused to be turned over. "Them keys, young man," he said at length, drawing forth from his pocket a bunch weighing some four pounds, "opens the door at the end ov the passage, and this one opens the street gate; now jist take that bit ov wood and bang me on one side ov my hed--not savagely, you know, but jist enough to flatten me, and make me look stunned--like----" At this novel proposition Mortimer broke into a loud laugh, but Mr. Wilkes was in earnest, and insisted on being "flattened." "I couldn't think of it, Mr. Wilkes!" cried Mortimer, weak with laughter; "I couldn't strike you systematically; I should be certain to demolish your head." And Mr. Wilkes retired, perforce, with the air of an injured man. Mortimer sat on the edge of the bed reflecting on the strange chain of circumstances which had placed him in his present position, and boldly facing the fact of how little chance he had of escaping Mr. Flint's malice. The excitement attending his arrest had passed away, and the reality of his utter helplessness came full upon him. For himself he dreaded little, for no punishment for a supposed crime, however disgraceful, could make him guilty; but a prolonged imprisonment would leave Daisy and Mrs. Snarle without means of support. This caused him more anxiety than the thought of any suffering attendant on his conviction. More than this troubled him. It was Daisy's devotion. He had, indeed, wished her to believe him innocent, but his generous mind revolted at holding her to promises made in happier moments. He could not make Daisy his wife while a blemish remained on his honor; and the circumstances relative to the forged check, with which the reader is conversant, he could not think of revealing, for Snarle's dying words haunted him strangely. While Mortimer was thus meditating, two hands grasped the iron bars of the window, which was directly opposite the bed, and a moment afterwards a man's head threw a shadow into the cell. Mortimer, absorbed in thought, had failed to notice it. The first expression of the face was that of mere curiosity; this was followed by a startled look, and then an intense emotion distorted the features. The face grew deathly pale, and the eyeballs glowed into the cell, more resembling those of a wild-cat than a human being's. A deep groan came from the window, and the head disappeared instantaneously. Mortimer looked up and glanced around the narrow room suspiciously, and then smiled to think how his fancy had cheated him. The face was Edward Walters.&nbsp;
