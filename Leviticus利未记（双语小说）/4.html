<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the Lord said to Moses, 
<br>4:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 晓 谕 以 色 列 人 说 ， 若 有 人 在 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 不 可 行 的 什 么 事 上 误 犯 了 一 件 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Say to the children of Israel: These are the offerings of anyone who does wrong through error, doing any of the things which by the Lord's order are not to be done: 
<br>4:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 或 是 受 膏 的 祭 司 犯 罪 ， 使 百 姓 陷 在 罪 里 ， 就 当 为 他 所 犯 的 罪 把 没 有 残 疾 的 公 牛 犊 献 给 耶 和 华 为 赎 罪 祭 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; If the chief priest by doing wrong becomes a cause of sin to the people, then let him give to the Lord for the sin which he has done, an ox, without any mark, for a sin-offering. 
<br>4:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 要 牵 公 牛 到 会 幕 门 口 ， 在 耶 和 华 面 前 按 手 在 牛 的 头 上 ， 把 牛 宰 于 耶 和 华 面 前 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he is to take the ox to the door of the Tent of meeting before the Lord; and put his hand on its head and put it to death before the Lord. 
<br>4:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 受 膏 的 祭 司 要 取 些 公 牛 的 血 带 到 会 幕 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the chief priest is to take some of its blood and take it to the Tent of meeting; 
<br>4:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 把 指 头 蘸 于 血 中 ， 在 耶 和 华 面 前 对 着 圣 所 的 幔 子 弹 血 七 次 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the priest is to put his finger in the blood, shaking drops of it before the Lord seven times, in front of the veil of the holy place.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the priest is to put some of the blood on the horns of the altar on which perfume is burned before the Lord in the Tent of meeting, draining out all the rest of the blood of the ox at the base of the altar of burned offering which is at the door of the Tent of meeting. 
<br>4:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 要 把 赎 罪 祭 公 牛 所 有 的 脂 油 ， 乃 是 盖 脏 的 脂 油 和 脏 上 所 有 的 脂 油 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he is to take away all the fat of the ox of the sin-offering; the fat covering the inside parts and all the fat of the inside parts, 
<br>4:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 并 两 个 腰 子 和 腰 子 上 的 脂 油 ， 就 是 靠 腰 两 旁 的 脂 油 ， 与 肝 上 的 网 子 和 腰 子 ， 一 概 取 下 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the two kidneys, with the fat on them, which is by the top part of the legs, and the fat joining the liver and the kidneys, he is to take away, 
<br>4:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 与 平 安 祭 公 牛 上 所 取 的 一 样 ， 祭 司 要 把 这 些 烧 在 燔 祭 的 坛 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; As it is taken from the ox of the peace-offering; and it is to be burned by the priest on the altar of burned offerings. 
<br>4:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 公 牛 的 皮 和 所 有 的 肉 ， 并 头 ， 腿 ， 脏 ， 腑 ， 粪 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the skin of the ox and all its flesh, with its head and its legs and its inside parts and its waste, 
<br>4:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 就 是 全 公 牛 ， 要 搬 到 营 外 洁 净 之 地 ， 倒 灰 之 所 ， 用 火 烧 在 柴 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; All the ox, he is to take away outside the circle of the tents into a clean place where the burned waste is put, and there it is to be burned on wood with fire.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And if all the people of Israel do wrong, without anyone's knowledge; if they have done any of the things which by the Lord's order are not to be done, causing sin to come on them; 
<br>4:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 会 众 一 知 道 所 犯 的 罪 就 要 献 一 只 公 牛 犊 为 赎 罪 祭 ， 牵 到 会 幕 前 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; When the sin which they have done comes to light, then let all the people give an ox for a sin-offering, and take it before the Tent of meeting. 
<br>4:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 会 中 的 长 老 就 要 在 耶 和 华 面 前 按 手 在 牛 的 头 上 ， 将 牛 在 耶 和 华 面 前 宰 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And let the chiefs of the people put their hands on its head before the Lord, and put the ox to death before the Lord.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the vail. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And put his finger in the blood, shaking drops of the blood seven times before the Lord in front of the veil. 
<br>4:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 又 要 把 些 血 抹 在 会 幕 内 ， 耶 和 华 面 前 坛 的 四 角 上 ， 再 把 所 有 的 血 倒 在 会 幕 门 口 ， 燔 祭 坛 的 脚 那 里 。&nbsp;

<br>4:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 把 牛 所 有 的 脂 油 都 取 下 ， 烧 在 坛 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the altar. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he is to take off all its fat, burning it on the altar. 
<br>4:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 收 拾 这 牛 ， 与 那 赎 罪 祭 的 牛 一 样 。 祭 司 要 为 他 们 赎 罪 ， 他 们 必 蒙 赦 免 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Let him do with the ox as he did with the ox of the sin-offering; and the priest will take away their sin and they will have forgiveness.
