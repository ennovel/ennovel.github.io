<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the Lord said to Moses, 
<br>20:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 还 要 晓 谕 以 色 列 人 说 ， 凡 以 色 列 人 ， 或 是 在 以 色 列 中 寄 居 的 外 人 ， 把 自 己 的 儿 女 献 给 摩 洛 的 ， 总 要 治 死 他 ， 本 地 人 要 用 石 头 把 他 打 死 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Again, say to the children of Israel, If any man of the children of Israel, or any other man living in Israel, gives his offspring to Molech, he is certainly to be put to death: he is to be stoned by the people of the land; 
<br>20:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 也 要 向 那 人 变 脸 ， 把 他 从 民 中 剪 除 ， 因 为 他 把 儿 女 献 给 摩 洛 ， 玷 污 我 的 圣 所 ， 亵 渎 我 的 圣 名 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And my face will be turned against that man, and he will be cut off from his people; because he has given his offspring to Molech, making my holy place unclean, and making my holy name common. 
<br>20:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 人 把 儿 女 献 给 摩 洛 ， 本 地 人 若 佯 为 不 见 ， 不 把 他 治 死 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And if the people of the land do not take note of that man when he gives his offspring to Molech, and do not put him to death, 
<br>20:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 就 要 向 这 人 和 他 的 家 变 脸 ， 把 他 和 一 切 随 他 与 摩 洛 行 邪 淫 的 人 都 从 民 中 剪 除 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then my face will be turned against him and his family, and he and all those who do evil with him will be cut off from among their people. 
<br>20:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 人 偏 向 交 鬼 的 和 行 巫 术 的 ， 随 他 们 行 邪 淫 ， 我 要 向 那 人 变 脸 ， 把 他 从 民 中 剪 除 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And whoever goes after those who make use of spirits and wonder-workers, doing evil with them, against him will my face be turned, and he will be cut off from among his people. 
<br>20:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 所 以 你 们 要 自 洁 成 圣 ， 因 为 我 是 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So make and keep yourselves holy, for I am the Lord your God. 
<br>20:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 们 要 谨 守 遵 行 我 的 律 例 ， 我 是 叫 你 们 成 圣 的 耶 和 华 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which sanctify you. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And keep my rules and do them: I am the Lord, who make you holy. 
<br>20:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 凡 咒 骂 父 母 的 ， 总 要 治 死 他 ， 他 咒 骂 了 父 母 ， 他 的 罪 要 归 到 他 身 上 （ 罪 原 文 作 血 。 本 章 同 。 ） 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Every man cursing his father or his mother is certainly to be put to death; because of his curse on his father or his mother, his blood will be on him. 
<br>20:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 与 邻 舍 之 妻 行 淫 的 ， 奸 夫 淫 妇 都 必 治 死 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And if a man has sex relations with another man's wife, even the wife of his neighbour, he and she are certainly to be put to death. 
<br>20:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 与 继 母 行 淫 的 ， 就 是 羞 辱 了 他 父 亲 ， 总 要 把 他 们 二 人 治 死 ， 罪 要 归 到 他 们 身 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the man who has sex relations with his father's wife has put shame on his father: the two of them are to be put to death; their blood will be on them. 
<br>20:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 与 儿 妇 同 房 的 ， 总 要 把 他 们 二 人 治 死 ， 他 们 行 了 逆 伦 的 事 ， 罪 要 归 到 他 们 身 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And if a man has sex relations with his son's wife, the two of them are to be put to death: it is unnatural; their blood will be on them. 
<br>20:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 人 若 与 男 人 苟 合 ， 像 与 女 人 一 样 ， 他 们 二 人 行 了 可 憎 的 事 ， 总 要 把 他 们 治 死 ， 罪 要 归 到 他 们 身 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And if a man has sex relations with a man, the two of them have done a disgusting thing: let them be put to death; their blood will be on them. 
<br>20:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 人 若 娶 妻 ， 并 娶 其 母 ， 便 是 大 恶 ， 要 把 这 三 人 用 火 焚 烧 ， 使 你 们 中 间 免 去 大 恶 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And if a man takes as wife a woman and her mother, it is an act of shame; let them be burned with fire, all three of them, so that there may be no shame among you. 
<br>20:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 人 若 与 兽 淫 合 ， 总 要 治 死 他 ， 也 要 杀 那 兽 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And if a man has sex relations with a beast, let him be put to death, and let the beast be put to destruction. 
<br>20:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 女 人 若 与 兽 亲 近 ， 与 它 淫 合 ， 你 要 杀 那 女 人 和 那 兽 ， 总 要 把 他 们 治 死 ， 罪 要 归 到 他 们 身 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And if a woman goes near a beast and has sex relations with it, you will put an end to the woman and the beast: their blood will be on them. 
<br>20:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 人 若 娶 他 的 姐 妹 ， 无 论 是 异 母 同 父 的 ， 是 异 父 同 母 的 ， 彼 此 见 了 下 体 ， 这 是 可 耻 的 事 ， 他 们 必 在 本 民 的 眼 前 被 剪 除 。 他 露 了 姐 妹 的 下 体 ， 必 担 当 自 己 的 罪 孽 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And if a man takes his sister, daughter of his father or his mother, and has sex relations with her and she with him, it is an act of shame: they are to be cut off before the children of their people; he has had sex relations with his sister, and his sin will be on him. 
<br>20:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 妇 人 有 月 经 ， 若 与 她 同 房 ， 露 了 她 的 下 体 ， 就 是 露 了 妇 人 的 血 源 ， 妇 人 也 露 了 自 己 的 血 源 ， 二 人 必 从 民 中 剪 除 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And if a man has sex relations with a woman at the time when she is unwell, he has seen her fountain and she has let the fountain of her blood be uncovered, and the two of them are to be cut off from among their people. 
<br>20:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 不 可 露 姨 母 或 是 姑 母 的 下 体 ， 这 是 露 了 骨 肉 之 亲 的 下 体 ， 二 人 必 担 当 自 己 的 罪 孽 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And you may not have sex connection with your mother's sister or your father's sister, for they are his near relations: their sin will be on them. 
<br>20:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 人 若 与 伯 叔 之 妻 同 房 ， 就 羞 辱 了 他 的 伯 叔 ， 二 人 要 担 当 自 己 的 罪 ， 必 无 子 女 而 死 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And if a man has sex relations with the wife of his father's brother, he has put shame on his father's brother: their sin will be on them; till the day of their death they will have no children. 
<br>20:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 人 若 娶 弟 兄 之 妻 ， 这 本 是 污 秽 的 事 ， 羞 辱 了 他 的 弟 兄 ， 二 人 必 无 子 女 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And if a man takes his brother's wife, it is an unclean act; he has put shame on his brother; they will have no children. 
<br>20:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 所 以 ， 你 们 要 谨 守 遵 行 我 一 切 的 律 例 典 章 ， 免 得 我 领 你 们 去 住 的 那 地 把 你 们 吐 出 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So then, keep my rules and my decisions and do them, so that the land which I am giving you as your resting-place may not violently send you out again. 
<br>20:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 在 你 们 面 前 所 逐 出 的 国 民 ， 你 们 不 可 随 从 他 们 的 风 俗 ， 因 为 他 们 行 了 这 一 切 的 事 ， 所 以 我 厌 恶 他 们 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And do not keep the rules of the nations which I am driving out before you; for they did all these things, and for that reason my soul was turned against them. 
<br>20:24 [hgb]&nbsp; 但 我 对 你 们 说 过 ， 你 们 要 承 受 他 们 的 地 ， 就 是 我 要 赐 给 你 们 为 业 ， 流 奶 与 蜜 之 地 。 我 是 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 ， 使 你 们 与 万 民 有 分 别 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated you from other people. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But I have said to you, You will take their land and I will give it to you for your heritage, a land flowing with milk and honey: I am the Lord your God who have made you separate from all other peoples. 
<br>20:25 [hgb]&nbsp; 所 以 ， 你 们 要 把 洁 净 和 不 洁 净 的 禽 兽 分 别 出 来 ， 不 可 因 我 给 你 们 分 为 不 洁 净 的 禽 兽 ， 或 是 滋 生 在 地 上 的 活 物 ， 使 自 己 成 为 可 憎 恶 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So then, make division between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the clean bird and the unclean: do not make yourselves disgusting by any beast or bird or anything which goes flat on the earth, which has been marked by me as unclean for you. 
<br>20:26 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 们 要 归 我 为 圣 ， 因 为 我 耶 和 华 是 圣 的 ， 并 叫 你 们 与 万 民 有 分 别 ， 使 你 们 作 我 的 民 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And you are to be holy to me; for I the Lord am holy and have made you separate from the nations, so that you may be my people. 
<br>20:27 [hgb]&nbsp; 无 论 男 女 ， 是 交 鬼 的 或 行 巫 术 的 ， 总 要 治 死 他 们 。 人 必 用 石 头 把 他 们 打 死 ， 罪 要 归 到 他 们 身 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Any man or woman who makes use of spirits, or who is a wonder-worker, is to be put to death: they are to be stoned with stones: their blood will be on them.
