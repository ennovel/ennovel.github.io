<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the Lord said to Moses, 
<br>14:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 长 大 麻 疯 得 洁 净 的 日 子 ， 其 例 乃 是 这 样 ， 要 带 他 去 见 祭 司 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; This is the law of the leper on the day when he is made clean: he is to be taken to the priest; 
<br>14:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 祭 司 要 出 到 营 外 察 看 ， 若 见 他 的 大 麻 疯 痊 愈 了 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the priest is to go outside the tent-circle; and if, after looking, the priest sees that the mark of the disease has gone from him, 
<br>14:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 就 要 吩 咐 人 为 那 求 洁 净 的 拿 两 只 洁 净 的 活 鸟 和 香 柏 木 ， 朱 红 色 线 ， 并 牛 膝 草 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the priest is to give orders to take, for him who is to be made clean, two living clean birds and some cedar wood and red thread and hyssop. 
<br>14:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 祭 司 要 吩 咐 用 瓦 器 盛 活 水 ， 把 一 只 鸟 宰 在 上 面 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the priest will give orders for one of the birds to be put to death in a vessel made of earth, over flowing water. 
<br>14:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 至 于 那 只 活 鸟 ， 祭 司 要 把 它 和 香 柏 木 ， 朱 红 色 线 并 牛 膝 草 一 同 蘸 于 宰 在 活 水 上 的 鸟 血 中 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he will take the living bird and the wood and the red thread and the hyssop and put them in the blood of the bird which was put to death over flowing water. 
<br>14:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 用 以 在 那 长 大 麻 疯 求 洁 净 的 人 身 上 洒 七 次 ， 就 定 他 为 洁 净 ， 又 把 活 鸟 放 在 田 野 里 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And shaking it seven times over the man who is to be made clean, he will say that he is clean and will let the living bird go free into the open country. 
<br>14:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 求 洁 净 的 人 当 洗 衣 服 ， 剃 去 毛 发 ， 用 水 洗 澡 ， 就 洁 净 了 ， 然 后 可 以 进 营 ， 只 是 要 在 自 己 的 帐 棚 外 居 住 七 天 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he who is to be made clean will have his clothing washed and his hair cut and have a bath, and he will be clean. And after that he will come back to the tent-circle; but he is to keep outside his tent for seven days. 
<br>14:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 第 七 天 ， 再 把 头 上 所 有 的 头 发 与 胡 须 ， 眉 毛 ， 并 全 身 的 毛 ， 都 剃 了 ， 又 要 洗 衣 服 ， 用 水 洗 身 ， 就 洁 净 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And on the seventh day he is to have all the hair cut off his head and his chin and over his eyes--all his hair is to be cut off--and he will have his clothing washed and his body bathed in water and he will be clean. 
<br>14:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 第 八 天 ， 他 要 取 两 只 没 有 残 疾 的 公 羊 羔 和 一 只 没 有 残 疾 ， 一 岁 的 母 羊 羔 ， 又 要 把 调 油 的 细 面 伊 法 十 分 之 三 为 素 祭 ， 并 油 一 罗 革 ， 一 同 取 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And on the eighth day let him take two male lambs, without any marks on them, and one female lamb of the first year, without a mark, and three tenth parts of an ephah of the best meal, mixed with oil, and one log of oil. 
<br>14:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 行 洁 净 之 礼 的 祭 司 要 将 那 求 洁 净 的 人 和 这 些 东 西 安 置 在 会 幕 门 口 ， 耶 和 华 面 前 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the priest who is making him clean will put the man who is being made clean, together with these things, before the door of the Tent of meeting. 
<br>14:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 祭 司 要 取 一 只 公 羊 羔 献 为 赎 愆 祭 ， 和 那 一 罗 革 油 一 同 作 摇 祭 ， 在 耶 和 华 面 前 摇 一 摇 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the priest is to take one of the male lambs and give it as an offering for wrongdoing, and the log of oil, waving them for a wave offering before the Lord; 
<br>14:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 把 公 羊 羔 宰 于 圣 地 ， 就 是 宰 赎 罪 祭 牲 和 燔 祭 牲 之 地 。 赎 愆 祭 要 归 祭 司 ， 与 赎 罪 祭 一 样 ， 是 至 圣 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering is the priest's, so is the trespass offering: it is most holy: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he is to put the male lamb to death in the place where they put to death the sin-offering and the burned offering, in the holy place; for as the sin-offering is the property of the priest, so is the offering for wrongdoing: it is most holy. 
<br>14:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 祭 司 要 取 些 赎 愆 祭 牲 的 血 ， 抹 在 求 洁 净 人 的 右 耳 垂 上 和 右 手 的 大 拇 指 上 ， 并 右 脚 的 大 拇 指 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And let the priest take some of the blood of the offering for wrongdoing and put it on the point of the right ear of him who is to be made clean, and on the thumb of his right hand and on the great toe of his right foot; 
<br>14:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 祭 司 要 从 那 一 罗 革 油 中 取 些 倒 在 自 己 的 左 手 掌 里 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And take some of the oil and put it in the hollow of his left hand; 
<br>14:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 把 右 手 的 一 个 指 头 蘸 在 左 手 的 油 里 ， 在 耶 和 华 面 前 用 指 头 弹 七 次 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And let the priest put his right finger in the oil which is in his left hand, shaking it out with his finger seven times before the Lord; 
<br>14:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 将 手 里 所 剩 的 油 抹 在 那 求 洁 净 人 的 右 耳 垂 上 和 右 手 的 大 拇 指 上 ， 并 右 脚 的 大 拇 指 上 ， 就 是 抹 在 赎 愆 祭 牲 的 血 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And of the rest of the oil which is in his hand, the priest will put some on the point of the right ear of the man who is to be made clean, and on the thumb of his right hand and on the great toe of his right foot, over the blood of the offering for wrongdoing; 
<br>14:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 祭 司 手 里 所 剩 的 油 要 抹 在 那 求 洁 净 人 的 头 上 ， 在 耶 和 华 面 前 为 他 赎 罪 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the rest of the oil in the priest's hand he will put on the head of him who is to be made clean; and so the priest will make him free from sin before the Lord. 
<br>14:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 祭 司 要 献 赎 罪 祭 ， 为 那 本 不 洁 净 ， 求 洁 净 的 人 赎 罪 ， 然 后 要 宰 燔 祭 牲 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the priest will give the sin-offering, and take away the sin of him who is to be made clean from his unclean condition; and after that he will put the burned offering to death. 
<br>14:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 把 燔 祭 和 素 祭 献 在 坛 上 ， 为 他 赎 罪 ， 他 就 洁 净 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the priest is to have the burned offering and the meal offering burned on the altar; and the priest will take away his sin and he will be clean. 
<br>14:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 若 贫 穷 不 能 预 备 够 数 ， 就 要 取 一 只 公 羊 羔 作 赎 愆 祭 ， 可 以 摇 一 摇 ， 为 他 赎 罪 ， 也 要 把 调 油 的 细 面 伊 法 十 分 之 一 为 素 祭 ， 和 油 一 罗 革 一 同 取 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And if he is poor and not able to get so much, then he may take one male lamb as an offering for wrongdoing, to be waved to take away his sin, and one tenth part of an ephah of the best meal mixed with oil for a meal offering, and a log of oil; 
<br>14:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 又 照 他 的 力 量 取 两 只 斑 鸠 或 是 两 只 雏 鸽 ， 一 只 作 赎 罪 祭 ， 一 只 作 燔 祭 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a burnt offering. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And two doves or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and one will be for a sin-offering and the other for a burned offering. 
<br>14:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 第 八 天 ， 要 为 洁 净 ， 把 这 些 带 到 会 幕 门 口 ， 耶 和 华 面 前 ， 交 给 祭 司 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, before the LORD. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And on the eighth day he will take them to the priest, to the door of the Tent of meeting before the Lord, so that he may be made clean. 
<br>14:24 [hgb]&nbsp; 祭 司 要 把 赎 愆 祭 的 羊 羔 和 那 一 罗 革 油 一 同 作 摇 祭 ， 在 耶 和 华 面 前 摇 一 摇 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the priest will take the lamb of the offering for wrongdoing and the oil, waving them for a wave offering before the Lord; 
<br>14:25 [hgb]&nbsp; 要 宰 了 赎 愆 祭 的 羊 羔 ， 取 些 赎 愆 祭 牲 的 血 ， 抹 在 那 求 洁 净 人 的 右 耳 垂 上 和 右 手 的 大 拇 指 上 ， 并 右 脚 的 大 拇 指 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:

<br>14:26 [hgb]&nbsp; 祭 司 要 把 些 油 倒 在 自 己 的 左 手 掌 里 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the priest will put out some of the oil in the hollow of his left hand, 
<br>14:27 [hgb]&nbsp; 把 左 手 里 的 油 ， 在 耶 和 华 面 前 ， 用 右 手 的 一 个 指 头 弹 七 次 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Shaking out drops of oil with his right finger before the Lord seven times: 
<br>14:28 [hgb]&nbsp; 又 把 手 里 的 油 抹 些 在 那 求 洁 净 人 的 右 耳 垂 上 和 右 手 的 大 拇 指 上 ， 并 右 脚 的 大 拇 指 上 ， 就 是 抹 赎 愆 祭 之 血 的 原 处 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the priest will put some of the oil which is in his hand on the point of the ear of the man who is to be made clean and on the thumb of his right hand and on the great toe of his right foot, on the place where the blood of the offering for wrongdoing was put; 
<br>14:29 [hgb]&nbsp; 祭 司 手 里 所 剩 的 油 要 抹 在 那 求 洁 净 人 的 头 上 ， 在 耶 和 华 面 前 为 他 赎 罪 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for him before the LORD. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the rest of the oil which is in the priest's hand he will put on the head of him who is to be made clean, to take away his sin before the Lord. 
<br>14:30 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 人 又 要 照 他 的 力 量 献 上 一 只 斑 鸠 或 是 一 只 雏 鸽 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons, such as he can get; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he will make an offering of one of the doves or the young pigeons, such as he is able to get; 
<br>14:31 [hgb]&nbsp; 就 是 他 所 能 办 的 ， 一 只 为 赎 罪 祭 ， 一 只 为 燔 祭 ， 与 素 祭 一 同 献 上 ， 祭 司 要 在 耶 和 华 面 前 为 他 赎 罪 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And of these, he will give one for a sin-offering and one for a burned offering, with the meal offering; and the priest will take away the sin of him who is to be made clean before the Lord. 
<br>14:32 [hgb]&nbsp; 这 是 那 有 大 麻 疯 灾 病 的 人 ， 不 能 将 关 乎 得 洁 净 之 物 预 备 够 数 的 条 例 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; This is the law for the man who has the disease of the leper on him, and who is not able to get that which is necessary for making himself clean. 
<br>14:33 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 和 华 晓 谕 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 说 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, 
<br>14:34 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 们 到 了 我 赐 给 你 们 为 业 的 迦 南 地 ， 我 若 使 你 们 所 得 为 业 之 地 的 房 屋 中 有 大 麻 疯 的 灾 病 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; When you have come into the land of Canaan which I will give you for your heritage, if I put the leper's disease on a house in the land of your heritage, 
<br>14:35 [hgb]&nbsp; 房 主 就 要 去 告 诉 祭 司 说 ， 据 我 看 ， 房 屋 中 似 乎 有 灾 病 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then let the owner of the house come and say to the priest, It seems to me that there is a sort of leper's disease in the house. 
<br>14:36 [hgb]&nbsp; 祭 司 还 没 有 进 去 察 看 灾 病 以 前 ， 就 要 吩 咐 人 把 房 子 腾 空 ， 免 得 房 子 里 所 有 的 都 成 了 不 洁 净 ， 然 后 祭 司 要 进 去 察 看 房 子 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the priest will give orders for everything to be taken out of the house, before he goes in to see the disease, so that the things in the house may not become unclean; and then the priest is to go in to see the house; 
<br>14:37 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 要 察 看 那 灾 病 ， 灾 病 若 在 房 子 的 墙 上 有 发 绿 或 发 红 的 凹 斑 纹 ， 现 象 洼 于 墙 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And if he sees that the walls of the house are marked with hollows of green and red, and if it seems to go deeper than the face of the wall; 
<br>14:38 [hgb]&nbsp; 祭 司 就 要 出 到 房 门 外 ， 把 房 子 封 锁 七 天 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the priest will go out of the door of the house, and keep the house shut up for seven days: 
<br>14:39 [hgb]&nbsp; 第 七 天 ， 祭 司 要 再 去 察 看 ， 灾 病 若 在 房 子 的 墙 上 发 散 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the priest is to come again on the seventh day and have a look and see if the marks on the walls of the house are increased in size; 
<br>14:40 [hgb]&nbsp; 就 要 吩 咐 人 把 那 有 灾 病 的 石 头 挖 出 来 ， 扔 在 城 外 不 洁 净 之 处 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the priest will give orders to them to take out the stones in which the disease is seen, and put them out into an unclean place outside the town: 
<br>14:41 [hgb]&nbsp; 也 要 叫 人 刮 房 内 的 四 围 ， 所 刮 掉 的 灰 泥 要 倒 在 城 外 不 洁 净 之 处 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he will have the house rubbed all over inside, and the paste which is rubbed off will be put out into an unclean place outside the town: 
<br>14:42 [hgb]&nbsp; 又 要 用 别 的 石 头 代 替 那 挖 出 来 的 石 头 ， 要 另 用 灰 泥 墁 房 子 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall plaister the house. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And they will take other stones and put them in place of those stones, and he will take other paste and put it on the walls of the house. 
<br>14:43 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 挖 出 石 头 ， 刮 了 房 子 ， 墁 了 以 后 ， 灾 病 若 在 房 子 里 又 发 现 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plaistered; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And if the disease comes out again in the house after he has taken out the stones and after the walls have been rubbed and the new paste put on, 
<br>14:44 [hgb]&nbsp; 祭 司 就 要 进 去 察 看 ， 灾 病 若 在 房 子 里 发 散 ， 这 就 是 房 内 蚕 食 的 大 麻 疯 ， 是 不 洁 净 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the priest will come and see it; and if the disease in the house is increased in size, it is the leper's disease working out in the house: it is unclean. 
<br>14:45 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 就 要 拆 毁 房 子 ， 把 石 头 ， 木 头 ， 灰 泥 都 搬 到 城 外 不 洁 净 之 处 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the house will have to be pulled down, the stones of it and the wood and the paste; and everything is to be taken out to an unclean place outside the town. 
<br>14:46 [hgb]&nbsp; 在 房 子 封 锁 的 时 候 ， 进 去 的 人 必 不 洁 净 到 晚 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And, in addition, anyone who goes into the house at any time, while it is shut up, will be unclean till evening. 
<br>14:47 [hgb]&nbsp; 在 房 子 里 躺 着 的 必 洗 衣 服 ， 在 房 子 里 吃 饭 的 也 必 洗 衣 服 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And anyone who has been sleeping in the house will have to have his clothing washed; and anyone who takes food in that house will have to have his clothing washed. 
<br>14:48 [hgb]&nbsp; 房 子 墁 了 以 后 ， 祭 司 若 进 去 察 看 ， 见 灾 病 在 房 内 没 有 发 散 ， 就 要 定 房 子 为 洁 净 ， 因 为 灾 病 已 经 消 除 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And if the priest comes in, and sees that the disease is not increased after the new paste has been put on the house, then the priest will say that the house is clean, because the disease is gone. 
<br>14:49 [hgb]&nbsp; 要 为 洁 净 房 子 取 两 只 鸟 和 香 柏 木 ， 朱 红 色 线 并 牛 膝 草 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And in order to make the house clean, let him take two birds and cedar-wood and red thread and hyssop; 
<br>14:50 [hgb]&nbsp; 用 瓦 器 盛 活 水 ， 把 一 只 鸟 宰 在 上 面 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And put one of the birds to death in a vessel of earth over flowing water; 
<br>14:51 [hgb]&nbsp; 把 香 柏 木 ， 牛 膝 草 ， 朱 红 色 线 ， 并 那 活 鸟 ， 都 蘸 在 被 宰 的 鸟 血 中 与 活 水 中 ， 用 以 洒 房 子 七 次 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And take the cedar-wood and the hyssop and the red thread and the living bird and put them in the blood of the dead bird and in the flowing water, shaking it over the house seven times. 
<br>14:52 [hgb]&nbsp; 要 用 鸟 血 ， 活 水 ， 活 鸟 ， 香 柏 木 ， 牛 膝 草 ， 并 朱 红 色 线 ， 洁 净 那 房 子 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he will make the house clean with the blood of the bird and the flowing water and with the living bird and with the cedar-wood and the hyssop and the red thread. 
<br>14:53 [hgb]&nbsp; 但 要 把 活 鸟 放 在 城 外 田 野 里 。 这 样 洁 净 房 子 （ 原 文 作 为 房 子 赎 罪 ） ， 房 子 就 洁 净 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But he will let the living bird go out of the town into the open country; so he will take away sin from the house and it will be clean. 
<br>14:54 [hgb]&nbsp; 这 是 为 各 类 大 麻 疯 的 灾 病 和 头 疥 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; This is the law for all signs of the leper's disease and for skin diseases; 
<br>14:55 [hgb]&nbsp; 并 衣 服 与 房 子 的 大 麻 疯 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And for signs of disease in clothing, or in a house; 
<br>14:56 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 及 疖 子 ， 癣 ， 火 斑 所 立 的 条 例 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And for a growth or a bad place or a bright mark on the skin; 
<br>14:57 [hgb]&nbsp; 指 明 何 时 为 洁 净 ， 何 时 为 不 洁 净 。 这 是 大 麻 疯 的 条 例 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; To teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; To make clear when it is unclean and when it is clean: this is the law about the disease of the leper.
