<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the Lord said to Moses and to Aaron, 
<br>15:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 们 晓 谕 以 色 列 人 说 ， 人 若 身 患 漏 症 ， 他 因 这 漏 症 就 不 洁 净 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath a running issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Say to the children of Israel: If a man has an unclean flow from his flesh, it will make him unclean. 
<br>15:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 患 漏 症 ， 无 论 是 下 流 的 ， 是 止 住 的 ， 都 是 不 洁 净 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his uncleanness. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; If the flow goes on or if the part is stopped up, to keep back the flow, he is still unclean. 
<br>15:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 所 躺 的 床 都 为 不 洁 净 ， 所 坐 的 物 也 为 不 洁 净 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean: and every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Every bed on which he has been resting will be unclean, and everything on which he has been seated will be unclean. 
<br>15:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 凡 摸 那 床 的 ， 必 不 洁 净 到 晚 上 ， 并 要 洗 衣 服 ， 用 水 洗 澡 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And anyone touching his bed is to have his clothing washed and his body bathed in water and be unclean till evening.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And on the eighth day he is to take two doves or two young pigeons and come before the Lord to the door of the Tent of meeting and give them to the priest: 
<br>15:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 祭 司 要 献 上 一 只 为 赎 罪 祭 ， 一 只 为 燔 祭 ， 因 那 人 患 的 漏 症 ， 祭 司 要 在 耶 和 华 面 前 为 他 赎 罪 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD for his issue. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And they are to be offered by the priest, one for a sin-offering and one for a burned offering, and the priest will take away his sin before the Lord on account of his flow.

<br>15:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 女 人 在 污 秽 之 中 ， 凡 她 所 躺 的 物 件 都 为 不 洁 净 ， 所 坐 的 物 件 也 都 不 洁 净 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be unclean: every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And everything on which she has been resting, while she is kept separate, will be unclean, and everything on which she has been seated will be unclean.

<br>15:30 [hgb]&nbsp; 祭 司 要 献 一 只 为 赎 罪 祭 ， 一 只 为 燔 祭 ， 因 那 人 血 漏 不 洁 ， 祭 司 要 在 耶 和 华 面 前 为 她 赎 罪 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; To be offered by the priest, one for a sin-offering and one for a burned offering; and the priest will take away her sin before the Lord on account of her unclean condition. 
<br>15:31 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 们 要 这 样 使 以 色 列 人 与 他 们 的 污 秽 隔 绝 ， 免 得 他 们 玷 污 我 的 帐 幕 ， 就 因 自 己 的 污 秽 死 亡 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that is among them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; In this way may the children of Israel be made free from all sorts of unclean conditions, so that death may not overtake them when they are unclean and when they make unclean my holy place which is among them. 
<br>15:32 [hgb]&nbsp; 这 是 患 漏 症 和 梦 遗 而 不 洁 净 的 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed goeth from him, and is defiled therewith; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; This is the law for the man who has a flow from his body, or whose seed goes from him so that he is unclean;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And for her who has a flow of blood, and for any man or woman who has an unclean flow, and for him who has sex relations with a woman when she is unclean.
