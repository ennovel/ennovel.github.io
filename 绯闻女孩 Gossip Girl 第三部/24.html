I mean, I do. Hi, guys! Sorry if it was a goodbye, but you know what is right: just the school and here I am - every night! So, WHO IS THE LINK? All right, then all we hear from those people in the Eyewitness News that give information to police because they were filmed by chance 0 son playing in the garden when a shooting happened and they took the number plate of the car with your digital camera or know what to do with . Well, I have something here that is half the opposite of that. I know who is on tape or, in this case, the link - but as it did throughout the Internet? I'm sure that now you know that link I'm talking about. Click it and you find an excellent coverage of two people who know and love in the snow park, arriando the shoes and rolling together in a warm coat for winter. J until it has a cute butt, I have not paid attention. And even with underwear samba-song, the butt of N not disappoint. Not surprising that the link is rolling through the Internet as the last 45 of the live CD. We will not give names, but I am almost sure that V did the work with the camera - saw its artistic angles and steady hand. But why she put it on the Web? It makes no sense. If that she was raised, she will never redeem, and if it was not, then who did? I have to say something finally for the first time: I'm confused. Flagra This came from the exclusive resort Hotellsle of Ia Paix on the island of St. Brats, hmmm, I mean, St. Barts: Flow out of a pet shop in candy - really the only city in St. Barts - leading a cage. Do not ask. Ms. E.W.R. vomiting in the wastepaper basket of women's toilet. Now we know where to get this B mania. B and S smuggling of another pitcher of rum punch to his village, where they are hidden since they arrived yesterday. EA guitar playing alone on the beach. He may be a cute, but nothing to show a vegetarian with a goofy shirt LEGALIZE HEMP. And here in NYC: K and I were crying and embracing in the Park Avenue while taking separate paths for Christmas. Hmmm, maybe they should change alliances of engagement. Your email Q: Dear Gossip Girl, I have a friend whose older sister is a friend of the Flow of public relations, and she told my sister who is in St. Barts Flow trying to pass the crisis of abstinence from cocaine. - Brownie A: Hi, Brownie, Well, I have heard that St. Barts is such a haven of drugs, so if you're right, it probably will not last long there. -GG Decorate the CORRIDORS Today is Christmas Eve. The last opportunity to buy everything from your list. The last chance to take a look under the tree and make sure that the majority of these are there, and if not, to paste new labels on boxes. The last chance to eat as many chocolate truffles from Godiva your heart desires. The last chance to feel with five years of new and leave cookies for Santa Claus of honey. It is also the last chance to be very, very nice to people who are buying gifts for you, so that they actually change their mind and decide to buy that Hermes Birkin bag of pig skin. Have a very nice Christmas! For you who love me, gossip girl s and b leave the boys are boys We can not just stay here all day - said the Serena Blair.Era almost noon on Christmas Eve and she was standing at the window of his village, looking forward the deck on the beach of white sand and turquoise sea beyond. - But Flow and Miles? - Blair reasons while hitting the folder Tom's of Maine in even electric tooth brush. -I thought we were in hiding. - Blair thought he was hiding in the village with Serena would give her time to work on test for Yale, but since then only what they did was drink cups of rum punch high with slices of orange, maraschino cherries and paper umbrellas, playing bridge and paint the nails of one another in pink. It was time to pause in your iBook. Serena had other ideas. A whole night and half a morning stuck doing nothing had its limits. - Go to the beach - she announced, pulling a short short Miu Miu on the panties of her white bikini. - And if someone wants to talk with us, will have to talk about this here - she walked by the room and departed the small triangles of white bra of your bikini, showing the rapidly Blair. Blair raised the eyebrows and then returned to brush their teeth. Spit in the sink. - I mean, do topless? - She asked, I like the idea. Serena based, playing a devilish smile on his face. - It is exactly what I mean Aaron, Miles and Tyler were taking a lesson from windsurfing to a few meters from where Blair and Serena desdobraram their yellow towels in the sand of the beach, took the top of the bikini and lie back with naked breasts to the skies. - Argh - Tyler said, turning back is not to have to see. Miles dropped the candle and fell into the water. Came to the surface and shook his head to Aaron, who was still standing on the board. - I can not believe you can live with that - he said with envy. The candle of Aaron was soaked. He pulled the rope with force, trying to lift her and block your view of the beach, but more than puxasse, sailing still under water. Blair probably thought that was doing topless European and sophisticated like that, but in his opinion it was something piranha. Anyone who walk through there could see, and then, at dinner, they see the clothes and would be able to imagine exactly as they were naked. Think about the left half silly. The instructor of windsurfing rastafári who wore Speedo, Prinz, walking in the water back to the beach. - Let me give a hand - and said he plunged, as a dolphin, appearing under the sail of Aaron and pushing it up the water with your head.
