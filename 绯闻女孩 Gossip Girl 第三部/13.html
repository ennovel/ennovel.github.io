The Miss. Glos looked at her. His hair color is the mouse encrespavam below, ro?ando the chin. It was exactly like when Blair and the way it was obviously a wig. - I think it is better to make another attempt is really is serious when he says he wants to go to Yale. Blair took a minute to register what the guide said. - But ... The Miss. Glos opened the folder and the Blair pointed to the inside pages with a talon and a yellow disgusting. - This is a perfectly adequate testing on the life of Audrey Hepburn - she began. - But it says nothing about you. You need to show Yale you can write well, who can think in a creative way and can give an extraordinary response to a common question. - She returned the test to Blair. Blair held the six pages stapled between the thumb and forefinger, the temples latejando. Died of willingness to tell the lady. Glos to fuck and buy a new wig while there was, but she knew that the university was very good guidance in their work. And if someone could help her to come at Yale, that someone was a lady. Glos. - OK - she said, concisely. - I will try again. - Good girl. Do not be so literary. Show them how much she loves the films of Audrey Hepburn instead of talking them. Blair seats and stood up. Ajeitou the skirt, trying to maintain composure in front of an insult so outrageous, acting exactly as you would think Audrey. - Happy Christmas to you - said politely. The Miss. Glos pull the handkerchief on the nose again and smiled. - Happy Christmas, Blair. Blair pulled the door of salad guiding university to close it and threw his essay contaminated trash in the corridor of metal with a sigh of irritation. Would both have fun on the beach in St. Barts. Serena would have to turn myself because Blair would have to spend the whole of the holiday fucking locked in a room writing the test for Yale. She thought about writing Let me go, fuck! on a sheet of paper and send to the office of admission to Yale, but considering the fact that the interviewer told the whole story of his life and then kissed, this may not be a good idea. She climbed the stairs that led to the fourth floor to get your coat closet ski blue Marc Jacobs, runs up against Kati Farkas and Isabel Coates on the stairs. - As proof of the French? - Kati asked. Chovido had this morning when she was going to school, and her strawberry blond hair was completely crespo. Kati Blair felt like a poodle that was struck by lightning. She has to shoulder. "Idiot." Departed the hair of the face with a shaken impatient. I was so sick of talking about school and notes and evidence of advanced courses that thought I could puke. - I am sure that she was well - said Blair loyally. Serena never studied and was not in class for advanced studies, but she always managed to do well enough to attend the class and write articles half decent. She was intelligent - all the girls were Constance - but the teachers complained of her if she did not use the full potential since he was in second grade. Well basically, Blair savor the fact that Serena is so little academic. It would be totally impossible if they are friends Serena was beautiful like that and then only bear A. - Hey, which rolled between you and that guy, Miles? asked Isabel. She could not believe those two. The last time we turn Kati and Isabel, they had passed out drunk in the backseat of a limo and the Blair rejected totally. Now they were acting as if it wanted to be best friends again. But Blair would not be in conversation with them about a guy who probably never see again so that they could spread the gossip around the school. - Actually, no - she responded with indifference. - Ooooh - balbuciou Isabel. - She is so reserved. That means something must have happened. Blair goggle. - Whatever. - Hey, what a lady. Glos said in his essay for Yale? - Kati asked. That was the problem of attending a school for girls only: everyone knew everything about everybody. That left Blair insane. - She liked - Blair lied. She began to climb the ladder again, the ringlet of rubi beating in the metal handrail as she walked. - See you later. I have to start studying for a test of English. - Wait! - Isabel screamed. Blair turned and waited. - What is it? - It is true that Serena and Flow are engaged? Blair could barely contain the laughter. She knew that it should tell the truth to them, but it would be much more interesting not count. - You said it, swinging the head with a smile of disbelief. - There is a madness? The two girls are looked clearly moved by the confirmation that achieved a very reliable source for gossip revolutionary. - Then she goes to St. Barts with you? - Asked Kati. Blair seats and turned the ringlet of ruby on his finger. - We plan the wedding while there. - Ah, it looks so fun! - Isabel said with his British accent more detestable. She looked at Kati and then back to Blair. - You think it is going to invite the ladies of honor? Blair turned and went up the stairs without effort, like Audrey in his wonderful Givenchy dress during the scene of the fashion show of Cinderella in Paris. - Maybe - she said. - If you are very, very nice to her.

Your email Q: Dude "Gossip Girl," Toei trying to deduce who is since you started this site q vc. Q do not think you speak of colleges unless q be the third year. I am only the first year, but'm cool with all veterans. So you might not be as cool as I think q is. Q I still think you must be a college professor of pervert or someone like that. - Jdwack A: Dear jdwack, Continue trying to deduce who I am because I will not tell you.

For you who love me, gossip girl Barneys to form the character On Thursday before Christmas, the Constance Billard finally released the girls to their luxurious vacation for 12 days through the school year. After school, Jenny met Nate in front of Barneys. She was wearing a hooded sweatshirt with blue-baby, a partnership with black fake fur collar, the uniform gray supercurto from school, a chapeuzinho red hair goat with his dark curls out underneath and gloves from goat hair red combining. It was lovely, and the minute in which the saw, Nate took the glove from her hand and gave him a kiss in the palm. Had achieved a huge stock of grass for Christmas with their supplier in 80 of the pizzeria with Madison, and was a very good mood. - I missed - he said, emerald-green eyes shining in the twilight of winter. The heart of Jenny started to jump. - I felt your flat too - she said, the cheeks a delicate pink. She took the pocket of the sparse Christmas card that he had done for him. - Take. Nate tore the envelope handmade. He looked the picture she had drawn with water, coal and gold pen, trying to understand exactly what it was. - It is a snowman holding a reindeer - Jenny explained. - Half a combination of the styles of Matisse and Picasso, but I do not know if it worked. Nate did not understand anything of Matisse and Picasso. He opened the card. Merry Christmas, Nate!, Said the caps in golden glitter. Love, Jennifer. Nate smiled and put the card in the pocket of the jacket. - Thanks. Jenny passed by the arm and led him into the store. - So, what you want for Christmas? I will buy their first present. She took more borrowed $ 50 with his father, who really was not anything close to all the money it already had. Since it began dating Nate, Jenny was spending more money than in its entire life.
