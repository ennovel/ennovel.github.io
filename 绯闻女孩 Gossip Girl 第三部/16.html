Then lowered and kissed Jenny. - But the people you see in the Year-new, all right? Nate Blair noted rummage in the ruby ring on his finger. He took a step forward, put your hand on the jacket sleeve and kissed her on the face. - Merry Christmas, Blair. The best actresses always remain composed in the face of insults. - Merry Christmas - she replied, keeping the chin lifted the maximum that was physically possible without falling back. Then, with the highest form that could pose, she turned to lift the back of the shop, pulling Serena behind you. Nate from the saw, admiring how the long dark hair fell to Blair in the back of the jacket Cashmere blue sky. He built the left hand and he breathed fresh and pure perfume that reminded Blair of bare skin. After turned to Jenny. The pompoms in her hair. The partnership avantajada black. Hands little girl. The shy smile. Blair was a relief to have gone, he stopped to compare the two. Because the real truth was that there was no comparison. A bottle of perfume as a dancer was on the desk of glass behind them. - Hey - Nate said changing the subject. - I saw the nutcracker? - Jenny studying art, then probably knew all of ballet. Jenny shook her head, trying to smile. He had gone to the Lincoln Center with the class of architecture and design, but it was the closest that came to see a ballet of truth. - No, not yet. That was not good. Definitely not good. Nate Blair had brought to see the nutcracker in the last three Christmas and, although he knew that was very stupid, I would like. It was kind of a trip: the first scene, during a Christmas party, the tree on stage was just a tree normal-sized. And then, after the little girl begins to sleep and dream, the tree leaves the ground, turning into a tree pumped steroids - was even greater than the Rockefeller Center tree. And after all the toys come to life and begin to fight. It was sensational. Nate pulled the phone from the pocket. - Have a dinner with his father tomorrow night, right? Jenny seats. - So let's see if they have tickets for the matinee. Jenny is supported at the counter of perfumes, dominated by those of flu symptoms again. Nate would take her to the ballet! How could she not love Nate? d try to write about sex in a new way Once the evidence came on Thursday, Dan went to the Sino-Cuban favorite coffee shop on Broadway and asked for a coffee with milk and rolinho spring. Then got a new block black and a black ballpoint pen. The all week he was trying to write something decent way to keep the proposal for the university, but everything I wrote was a complete waste. He never had trouble writing before - in general, the words simply fluíam him. Obviously he was distracted by the evidence, but that was not a justification. He was blocking writer. Dan bebeu um gole, pingando gotas de café com leite em toda a primeira página em branco do bloco. In a way, have linked the blocking of the major writer. Tolstoy had. Hemingway had. He was not sure whether your favorite French existentialist had, but concluded that everyone should probably go through it one time or another. That does not make things less painful, however. Indeed, it was excruciating. Poor thing, that tormented soul. Dan knew, only to look at the old black block, the last time that he had written anything of value was before Thanksgiving, before he and Vanessa kiss is the first time and realize they were in love. He turned rolinho the spring in a thick sauce of plum and has a bite. Besides the death, love was his favorite subject, but now I was loving the words he used to write about it seemed superficial and rough. If he could at least find a new angle to approach the topic of love. Plunged in the spring rolinho sauce and took another bite. The hot fat rolinho of trickled down through the wrist. Esbarrou a waitress at the hip with his elbow and he dropped what was left of the cup rolinho, coffee with milk spreading everywhere.
<br> Most people are annoying, but for Dan was a moment of illumination. Sex!, He thought. The sex was the final physical expression of love, and it was so, although it was never done, he wanted to happen at the right time, when the only way to tell what was really meant to make love. Dan took the pen cap. He read much critical theory to know that some of the biggest clichés to write about sex was to use images of flowers desabrochando, the sunrise and fireworks. He also knew it was possible to do something that did not appear sexual. But he wanted to write about the sex of new and unexpected ways. He looked at the half eaten rolinho spring, brown coffee, thinking.
