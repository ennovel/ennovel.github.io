I mean, I do. Hi, guys! AME HER SISTER, BUT NO OTHER Drew my attention that we have not heard a peep on the half-brother of skytech of B, the lovely A. You may be thinking that he is busy studying for the tests and met with the new band. But no. He's hiding. And I'm almost convinced that the reason why he is hiding because he is dealing with some serious problems. The latest of these is that he called his friend drummer M to go with him to St. Barts, and I suspect that the reason for him to do this is that M B keep busy and out of your sight. Your email Q: Dear GG, So the health of the class of J and I know she is doing therapy because of the obsession it has with navel. She, like so, you must go to the bathroom all the time you make sure that it is still there, and when changed clothes for physical education class when she looks at the entire world. Is it an aberration. - Ronisays A: Hi, ronasays, So, what is the problem? Umbilicus are sensual. At least mine is. - GG Q: Hi, GG, I was just thinking that you would like to know that I think I live in the same building of B you always talk, and sometimes I catch her correspondence by mistake. Her mother receives tons of letters from New Beginnings, which is either a clinic for fertility or a counseling center for drugs and alcohol. I looked in the phone book. - Peekaboo A: Hi, peekaboo, Let's hope that it will only give money to them and not really use their services. - GG Flagra S giving the doorman a snowman of solid chocolate with a meter height of gold wrapped in paper Godiva. Flow is really exaggerating, unless S has another admirer - she plays the cards out without even reading. D looking for water in 79 of the pier, looking for inspiration. V in a bar in Billyburg, testing its new figure improved by Victoria's Secret, perhaps? B and S out of J. Sisters Salon, after making waxing to St. Barts. It seems that there will be amazing! Have wonderful holiday and do not forget to have fun like crazy. I know I am. See you there!
<br> For you who love me, gossip girl b is stuck in economy class, attracting men like flies Blair Waldorf, the testing proposal to the University of Yale, December 23 What I most like in the film persona of Audrey Hepburn is that she is proud and accessible at the same time. She hovers, but is down to earth. It is mysterious, but open. Blair stopped typing and pressed the backspace of your iBook until all words were deleted. Persona film? What the hell was that? It was with that she looked like something unusual for the banking cineastra, as Vanessa Abrams, the head of scraped knees and the class of fatty cinema. The case was that Blair had to write about Audrey Hepburn as appeared in the movies, and not as a real person, because Blair honestly did not know much about the real Audrey, unless it had stopped using Givenchy when she became older, all cut only the hair and wore khakis and black rulê neck all the time. Blair had caught a lot of books on Audrey Hepburn in the library, but not passed the first chapter. I do not know the problems of colitis of Audrey, or from his work in UNICEF. It was much more interesting was how the life of Audrey than reading about real life. - What is writing? - Miles said, adding the orange juice with a minigarrafa of Smirnoff vodka. Aaron Miles had invited to spend the Christmas with him in St. Barts and decided not to tell Blair that were in the check-in counter of United Airlines. It was quite obvious that the only reason for Miles to go was because he thought it would all the time of the trip with Blair. But Blair was determined to make it understand, even before aterrisagem, he had made a sad mistake. - Nothing - she said without looking at him. They had to leave the apartment in very bad time of 7:45 in the morning. Now it was a plane in the afternoon and was still an hour of St. Barts. Aaron was asleep, or maybe I was only pretending not to have to see Miles on top of giving Blair. Serena was listening to Coldplay in discman, relieved to be away from the constant flood of gifts from Flow. Tyler playing chess in his Game Boy and was in a bad mood, Why at the last minute the mother of his friend, the prince Rolf von Wurtzel, decided not to let Rolf was St. Barts with Tyler because the young German prince had a problem embarrassing to pee in bed. Blair moved the ice cubes in your drink with a brown plastic canudinho. Thank God for small favors. - I tried to talk to you all week - said Miles as a reclining chair in an attempt to stretch your legs long. To great dismay of Blair, all were done squeezed sardine in economy class. - But I have written the wrong number or something. Blair continued with eyes on the computer screen. No, she answered quietly. Is that I gave you the wrong number. Miles extended his arm and passed by the fingers tips of hair from Blair. - I missed you - he whispered. She looked at him without smiling, eyes and departed again, asking yourself what Audrey Hepburn would do in this situation unpleasant.
