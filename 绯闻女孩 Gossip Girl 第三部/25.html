Aaron pulled the cord until the candle where it should, perpendicular to the board. He grabbed the handle of rubber stuck to the sail and is bent back as the wind took the sail. The board deslizou on the surface of the water, making some of tapas barulhinhos was when the waves and leaving a beautiful trail along the way. Aaron felt very cool. I was getting! Some people started shouting after him, and he looked for on the shoulder. Serena and Blair were standing in the towel, even without the bikini bra, clapping and yelling for him. - Vai, Aaron, go, Aaron! That stud! Aaron looked at them - he could not avoid - the second most Porum. When it turned again, the board had reached a bank of sand that came out of the bay and he flew back, landing like a crab upset back in shallow water. Ai. Miles wanted to talk to Blair, but was not sure whether there was a tacit code on the far reach of a girl of topless without giving the impression to be looking for it with bad intent. Prinz had to rescue Aaron nadado the bank, then Miles pushed his surfboard to the beach and walked the sand until about two and a half meters of cloth for Blair. She and Serena were still lying in back. Oh, man, and both had a vision. - Hi - said Miles with indifference. Blair turned his head and eyes semicerrou for him. This would be funny. She sat, giving you a full frontal nudity. That is, the waist up. - Oi. Miles looked at the sand, corando against their will. He was so cute in surfing shorts of orange collar and shell, the spindly blond hair pointing in all directions. - Hmmm, I was just wondering if you are planning to go on a Christmas party tonight. Blair looked at Serena. - Are you planning to go to a Christmas party tonight? She whispered. Serena laughed, keeping his hand on his eyes like a visor. - Of course. Blair turned to Miles. - Of course we are - she replied. Miles based, trying to keep their eyes on her face. - Legal. See you later. Blair smiled and escutcheons eyes, watching him drag it to the board for windsurfing and show your muscles while pushed back into the water. That was so fun. How many times the kids gave you two and a half meters of space to breathe? She lay back in the towel and turned on the belly. It could be fun, but even using solar filter 45, there was a limit to the sun that the breasts of a girl could take! After one and a half hours of sunshine, Serena had completely tan on both sides. Was about to say that the Blair has arrived when the sun ... - Serena? She turned and felt. Yes, it was Flow. And, yes, she was still without the top of the bikini. He seemed not mind. Went straight to the edge of the towel and Serena is bent on it. In part, Blair was lying face down, his head covered with a white shirt, pretending to sleep. - At last - Flow sighed, moving with a shaken the bunches of dark blue eyes of cilia long. Was wearing orange shorts of surf-electric and nothing more, and his body was lean and muscular with a tan buttery roasted to perfection with cinnamon. In the neck, a tooth shark hung on a leather cord. - I felt my absence? Serena has to rub your shoulders and arms bare, which means hiding the breasts to prevent Flow had a good view of them. - Well ... you sent me many gifts. He wrinkle the forehead. - Not so well. Perhaps most of these had been Kati and Isabel than she thought. With those two was unclear. - Well, whatever - Serena said. - In any case, I heard the news? It seems that we are engaged. Flow laughed. - Yeah, I already knew. Do not heat with it. You will get used. The case was that Serena was not sure that I get used to it. Never was out with a star of the rock before and had much fun with Flow that night, but there were many other guys there. Of rock groupies, photographers, pilots of race, actors, DJs In a way, Serena was like the hummingbird that had seen the night before while he tirelessly buzz of a flower to another. She did not want it to hold a single flower, drinking until the last drop. I enjoy the greatest possible number of flowers. Serena dragged tail-to-shoulder on the horse and examined the tips, without saying anything. When he was going to throw their arms around him and say how much had to miss as he never wanted to be free? - Hey, my band will play in a Christmas party tonight - he said finally. - I was hoping that maybe we could go out, so I'll give you your Christmas present. Serena smiled. Oh, my God, not another gift. - Be there. - Legal - he made a break, hoping that she said anything else. But she said no. - All right. See you tonight. - See you - Serena is disposed of and back again repeatedly cutucou the ribs of Blair. You are so hypocritical - Blair muttered, turning up and taking the shirt of the face. Serena turned her head. - How so? - You act as if hated all the things he gives you, but I bet you can hardly wait to see what is going to give him a Christmas. Serena laughed. Blair was right. She could lament about how he wanted to present the flow of the Flow, but the girls like these, especially the rock stars and famous criminally beautiful. explained the link - What camera? - Muttered Ruby, the sister of 22 years Vanessa. They were three in the afternoon of Saturday, but only seemed that Ruby had gone to bed a few hours ago, her eyes were blurry delineator of the previous night and she still wearing a pair of leather wine glued to the skin. Ruby slept on a futon in it should be the living room of his fourth-and-room on the second floor of a building in Williamsburg, in Brooklyn. The apartment was full of equipment - amplifiers, sound boxes, guitars and microphones of the band of Ruby, the SugarDaddy, and cameras and lighting equipment of the filming of Vanessa. The floor was a carpet that means their parents crazy hippies artists tissue had a tear in their house on the outskirts of Burlington, in Vermont. The carpet was red and olive-green-apple and had a theme Ark of Noah, with animals standing in pairs on a ferry in a red sea, but was so covered by clothing and equipment of Ruby sound that the animals were completely hidden. - My Sony digital video camera - Vanessa insisted furious. - I left the bench in the kitchen yesterday - she was planning to examine the footage it had done in the park on Friday to see if they had some icicle that was worth saving and I delete the part of Nate and Jenny, but not now find the camera anywhere. Ruby goggle and pulled the pillow over the face. - I lent. Vanessa looked at her. Ruby was still provocatively with the pillow covering his face. - As well, lent? What the hell is that? - Lent to some friends in the Five and Dime. They are using to make a movie about skating. - I had some things in it! - Vanessa screamed horrified. - Things in my new movie! Ruby took the pillow and the guy feels. - So it seems that you do not have ten cameras. Sorry - she said sarcastically. - Sorry to have invaded your space without permission. Can I get a hug? Vanessa's sister faced with hands closed with such force that the nails left marks in slapping hands. Now she knew that had received 15 e-mails this morning accusing it of being a voyeur sluty, lesbian and pornography. The friends of Ruby obviously did more than take borrowed camera, they took what was there and raised hell in the Internet. Dan already thought it was perverted. What is it thinking now? On the afternoon of Christmas Eve, Dan was surfing the Internet, looking for articles on the block as writer and heal it. All I found was so outrageous and stupid. Exit walk. As he no longer walk across Manhattan daily, ruminando its inability to write anything coherent. Take a hot bath. He hated baths. All you did was let him drowsy. Practice exercises [i /]. No, thanks. His diet of cigarettes and coffee did not lead to the exercises. A site discussing the merits of taking acid. Apparently, an award winning writer had written an entire novel on a journey of acid one night and not remember to have it written in the morning. But unless the drinks at parties, Dan was across the face side, and he would not begin to take acid now. Another site advised to try a year in which you write the first word that comes to mind and then extrapolates from it. You can end up with a list of purchases, said the site, but even that was better than nothing. Dan decided to try this. Opened a blank page of the block and poise the pen. He wrote the word phone, but then your computer bipou, indicating that it had a new e-mail. He took the mouse and clicked the inbox. The message was Zeke, his only friend in Riverside. Take a look at the link below, man. - Z Dan clicked on the link, thinking it was probably another silly fool of basketball that Zeke had found. He turned to the block without waiting to see what appeared on screen. Phone. And now? He needed another word. His father knocked on the door open and stuck their heads in the room. - Hi, Dan, I will go to buy some bread. Any special request? Dan turned the chair, about to tell the father to bring a large cup of black coffee, but suddenly the face of the father was awful while watching the computer screen of Dan - Jennifer Tallulah Humphrey ... are you? - Trovejou Rufus, overwhelm the room like a rabid bear. Was wearing a white shirt and gray hair and torn Onion crespo espetava from all sides of the head. Dan turned the chair back to see your computer screen. The first thing I recognized was the red hat of Jenny. Then he saw what seemed to be the butt of Jenny exposed in a white bikini. Suddenly a guy with wavy golden hair placed in the mouth of Jenny ass. The camera quickly cut to the face arriando the pants, then the image returned to them, embraced by force from within his jacket, making what seemed obscene. Father and son watched in horrified disbelief as the movie is repeated endlessly. - Jennifer! - Rufus berrou again, spreading a spit of anger on the computer screen. Jenny appeared in the doorway looking the picture of innocence in a knitted velvet dress with her hair pulled back into a fuzzy pompoms of tail-to-horse. - What? - She asked. Dan pushed the chair back so that she could see the screen where it was stopped. - What? - Jenny repeated impatient. She took a step forward, after the hand flew up to the mouth when he saw his bare butt on the screen. It was like watching a horror movie in which she was the star. How did this happen?, She was asked, totally mortificada. - These are you and your partner Nate - Rufus pointed unnecessarily, retorcida the face of anger. He was a liberal father. Dan left smoking and drinking in the room whenever I wanted. Jenny left buy the first pair of platform shoes when she was nine years. But Jenny was still her baby, and see if her squirmy seminua with a boy on the Internet was more than enough to give him a proof of reality. Emudecida of horror, Jenny sees the screen as the movie is repeated. Ali was the hat it, the thong, the ass with Nate's hand in it, then the two rolled into the snow in his jacket. Was a moment so private and so special, but now was there to see the world - including his father and his brother. She tore a small winch to gasp and shot out of the room. Rufus looked at the screen for a second more and then to the Dan - Do you know anything about it? Dan shook his head indicating that no, but somehow feels responsible. He was so distracted by the blocking of its writer and lies about sex with Vanessa that he had not protected Jenny that rich bastard and thief of babies of Nate. - Well, from now on I want to make it an eye on her - grunhiu Rufus. - Can be tolerant, but I can not see her around like a prostitute. Dan assentiu solemnly. Rufus gave him a pat on the shoulder and went to the room of Jenny, where she was lying face down on the bed with her head buried in a soft pillow of goose-pen, surrounded by pictures Nate from his beloved. - Jennifer. - Her father controlled the voice to the maximum. -I never thought I would do it, but you will not let me choose. Is punishment for the rest of the holiday. Without leave. Without films. Without allowance. No calls. Without e-mails. With nothing. And certainly no contact with that Nate. Dan will see you as a hawk and make sure that you do not evacuate, because you clearly do not deserve trust. Jenny feels. The face was stained and the lower lip train. - It is not fair! -she protested. -I do not know who did this! It was not my fault! Nate and I are in love! He took me to see the nutcracker. We have done nothing to wrong! Rufus waved his hand in the air to silence her. - You are too new to know anything, especially of love - he trovejou sharply. - But father, I do not know who we filmed - Jenny begged, hugging his panda. Rufus raised the eyebrows thick, gray and disorderly and rub the stubbly chin. - You think everything is so well? - I do not care! - Jenny shouted, throwing down the panda and irrompendo a furious attack of tears. - Do not turn to what you think! We did nothing wrong. Rufus is squat and pulled from the shelves of Jenny intact a copy of Anna Karenina that he had last summer. He stood up and shot in bed. - Let me tell you what I think - berrou him. - I think you need to stay in the house by reading more books! Jenny looked at the book infantile and kicked until he slipped and fell on the bed floor of wood. Rufus shook his head in disgust and turned, closing the door behind you before you really lose your head. Dan heard from his room, still watching the movie that is repeated on the computer screen. Now that had passed the initial shock of seeing a film starring his sister porn on the Web, he saw that there was something terribly familiar in the work of the camera. The unusual angles. The way the camera is very close, the images were almost abstract, and then, in a panoramic, Nate and Jenny are just one point squirmy in pure white snow. It was the work of Vanessa Abrams, Dan was sure. He turned off the computer, enojado with himself for having seen for so long, but even more enojado with Vanessa and Jenny. As they turn into ... Dan got the black block and immediately thought of a new word ara begin the exercise of blocking writer. He took the pen and wrote. Putas No one gives reuni?ozinha.
