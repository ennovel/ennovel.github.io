In the secondary, most of them went to different schools throughout the East Coast. So when they saw the island again, was like a reunion of former colleagues. On July 4 a whole gang of them was a huge bonfire on the beach and light fireworks which were smuggled from Canada. And throughout Christmas Eve Nate always walked with the same two guys and smoked his pipe in the game room. The game room was covered in panels of oak, had a huge fireplace of stone and a slate floor of which was heated by copper pipes underneath it. There were impressive horns hang on the walls, taken from deer and elk hunted by the grandfather of Nate. There was a bar in oak full of rare Scotch whiskey aged cognac and Europe, and a wine cellar where he came down a ladder through a hatch under the Persian carpet fabric by hand. A pool of the old mahogany table with mahogany legs on top of carving and a red felt occupied the middle of the room. Nate filled the pipe. He had since the 13 years, and was covered with Band-Aids Looney Tunes. The other two boys laughed at him as an old comrade who had gone through even more extravagant than their shit. - Man - said John Gause, who had brought the stuff. - Good to see you. John wore a vest of caramel skin of sheep, dingy jeans and a pair of cowboy boots in caramel leather. It was a great visual, unless you were the Marlboro man or a model of Ralph Lauren, and he was not either of the two. A week before the tests, John was expelled for trafficking de.Deerfield and was returning from a season of ten days on a ranch in Wyoming, where was sent to learn values such as honesty, trust and respect by her partner. Nate filled the pipe and went to Ryan O'Brien, who had only 15 years but was more stoned than John and Nate together. After being expelled from St.Jude 's the first week of school, Ryan went to Hanover Academy, the school for which Serena had gone. - I think you grew up - Nate said. - Rayna does not seem high to you? - Asked him to John. Ryan lit the lighter on the pipe. 1.85 tall and had black and curly hair that fell on the shoulders was almost equal to the Flow, but darker. - Fuck you - he said, pulling up a pair of baggy gray snowboarding Burton. Nate Ryan hoped that such a shot and move the pipe to it. The sun was putting the windows and the game room were pink. He was very snowy winter, and the huge house was nestled in a mountain of snow from two meters and a half. On the outside there was no bus or car alarms, snoring. It was completely silent. But if the inquiry heard, Nate could hear the sound of the sea pounding on the rocks. He loved that sound. Sometimes, at night, was lying in bed, listening. He gave a shot, covering the top of the pipe so that the smoke does not escape. Then gave another, rewarding themselves by spending two hours reading the whole of that day proposed for the university and completing the parties easy. He exalou, went to John the pipe and closed eyes. It was good to be out of town, away from school and all that spoke both of the future. Here he could relax and enjoy yourself without worrying about tests, university or to respond to someone. John ended the pipe and fell in the pool table. She took the ball and rolled in white hands. - Hey, Nate - he began. - What was that movie porn on the Internet? Nate blinked slowly for him, like a lizard piscandopara the sun. - Huh? Ryan lit a Marlboro Light and blew a few rings of smoke to the roof of beams and columns. - You know. You and that little of brown curly hair and huge tits. Nate seats. He knew what Ryan was talking, but at a fraction of a second could not remember her name. - Jennifer - he said, is reminiscent of a sudden. - This is it, Jennifer. You did not see the link? Nate shook his head. - What link? John took a cue from snooker in support of the wall and turned in their hands as a bayonet. - The link that type well, everybody is talking about, man! - He laughed. - I can not believe you did not see! Ryan got the blue cubes of chalk to bat, took it to the nose and smell, as one would Chapad?o. - An entire movie is kind of you and that girl, to Jennifer - he said. - Type thereby screwing around in Central Park. Nate put the pipe in front of the face. Remember not to take screwing around with Jennifer in the park. Do not remember screwing around with Jennifer to take anywhere. The only question was reminded of his crazy pictures on the walls of her room. He shook his head and laughed doidona and heavy for yousame. A porn on the Internet? That was good. These guys were always sacaneando it. Giving the shoulder, he near the mouth of the pipe stem and lit the lighter, giving a long and great shot from Christmas Eve. Was going to be a very gentle, where Jennifer and those pictures were crazy tiny points in foggy distance. The intercom's home place. Suddenly the voice of country club in New England the father of Nate filled the room. - Your mother and I will take a few cocktails in the lounge. Want to come with us? You might think they were tied, but Nate always went with his parents when he was doid?o aristocrats. They were the drinks stronger, and also was eve of Cream!. Nate spent the paraJohn pipe and pressed the button on the intercom. - Coming up - release the button and seats for John.Vá forward. One more shot, then you better go. John Ryan and he looked to the last shot. - And then, you and this girl, the Jennifer, are still, like so together? - Ryan asked. Nate got the ball and rolled eight of the snooker table. He tried to remember the way things had left with] ennifer, but just what you came to mind was of plush panda who was in her bed. It was funny how he kept forgetting the part "I love you." - No - Nate said. - No way. John has ended and that he and Nate Ryan they left the back door of the game room for the snow. Then he closed the door, put the pipe in a heap of Triscuits in the sink of the bar and climbed the ladder to make gin and tonic-coIher fresh oysters of Maine with their parents. b shows the mother of a surprise Blair had taken a bath and put the new pink dress transparent the Calypso. Now she was sitting on deck smoking a Merit and hoping that Serena got it while thinking about Audrey Hepburn. As if it was not always thinking of Audrey Hepburn. Another thing she loved in Audrey, and I wanted to discuss the test for the university, was the versatility of Audrey. Whatever the scenario or the type of costumes that had to use - such as tweed clothing of a student in the bookstore scene in Cinderella in Paris, or the crazy hat and dress of income in the Ascot scene in My dear lady she seemed perfectly at ease, adapting to the environment while maintaining their audreysmo elegant. Blair liked to think she would be able to do that when it to college. Since she and Nate would not even live together in an apartment near the campus in New Haven, it could very well have to live in a room with some colleagues from the fourth unknown. Might have to eat in the cafeteria, and finally had to go to school. But no way would begin using the Yale and sweaters larg?es backpack. Would maintain the dignity, the sense of style and natural blairismo. Blair gave a shot in the cigarette, trying to imagine Audrey at Yale, using the black dress of Jennifer's luxury, with black gloves up to the elbow and collar of diamonds and pearls. And then she fell on them. Was exactly what we should do the test: to make Audrey a student of Yale in the script of a film! The Miss. Glos told her to be creative. Well, you can be much more creative than that! Blair jumped and opened the door of the town with a thud, eager to start writing immediately. She could skip the celebration of Christmas Eve idiot. Go to Yale was much more important.&nbsp;&nbsp; Serena was standing in front of the mirror tying canga a sea-green with beads at the waist. Was still using the white bikini wet and had sand in the hair. - I thought I had it done - said Blair. Serena wrinkle the forehead. - I am not in order. - Everyone expected that it would be beautiful doll for all and Flow, but in truth, why should he? The case was that Serena was still ten times more beautiful than any other girl on the island, regardless of what you were wearing. - So you use the bikini? - Blair asked, confused. - Arrais. Blair picked up the iBook and the stock market opened in the neck. - I think you are contradicting. Serena sink heavily beside her. - Maybe - she looked inquisitivamente for Blair, who was already typing. - What is writing? - A roadmap - Blair and his name entered on December 24 at the top of the page, and then provisionally: Audrey goes to the university. - I think I will skip the party to work on it.
<br> - And I will talk about contradiction. Miles is completely crazy to leave with you today, and I am not alone in this thing - Serena said. She rested her head on the shoulder of Blair. - No one wants to have fun Christmas Eve? Blair bit the lower lip. - I want, but I want more into Yale. Serena extended her hand and quickly closed the laptop. - Well, I will ensure that you have everything you want - she shouted, jumping and pulling Blair. -Come on, please? Blair sighed. Serena had the incredible ability to go from bad mood to joy at a glance. - OK - she sighed. - But if I do not get in Yale, the fucking fault will be all yours. Aaron Miles and were waiting for the girls in the bar. Aaron had done the skytech to leave straight on the side of the head and rose on top. Wore a black linen jacket over a gray shirt and black trousers linen. And, if not half-brother of Blair, it could even have found it so cute. Aaron thought that Blair was more than a cute.
<br> The tan it was stronger and had brown hair bands of golden sun. The pink dress was loose, but the transparent tissue joined the body in certain places. She looked a goddess, but it is clear that he could not say that to her., Aaron was so afraid of saying anything inappropriate that has become almost robotic when dealing with Blair. - It is better we go and sit down - he said to nobody in particular. - Your mom and dad have a big surprise, they want to tell people. Are you waiting for almost an hour. Blair spying on crowded dining room, where his mother, Cyrus and Tyler were seated at the table. -, - Oh, my God I can hardly wait. Please, can I have a drink first? - Begged her.
