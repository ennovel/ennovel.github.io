The music of Beck ended and people returned to flocks to the tables to get drunk more. - My feet are dying! - Gemeu Kati Farkas, throwing themselves into a chair in front of Blair and making shoes. - My already-dead echoed Isabel Coates, sinking in the chair beside her. In the last two years, while Serena was in Hanover Academy in New Hampshire, Isabel and Kati had dressed in Blair. They bought the Sephora makeup together, drank cappuccino at Le Canardjuntas and, yes, they even went to banheirojuntas. Blair dominated the social scene. Then, when both were with her, they felt almost famous, using the red carpet everywhere. But shortly before the Day of the Discovery of America, Serena was expelled from school and reappeared in the city to steal from both Blair and Kati and Isabel returned to the old and cheap Kati and Isabel ever. - How do you are not dancing? - Kati asked. Blair has to shoulder. - I am not in the mood for it. Isabel sighed. - Only we have to do the tests in the coming weeks she said, mingling with the touch of boredom tiredness in the voice of Blair. -And then we will have a break because of Christmas. - You are so lucky to go to a place that is too Kati said. - I will have to do that crap to ski in Aspen idiot again. - Well, is not as bad as my country house in Connecticut chatérrima-Isabel replied. - Vai be sensational - tore Serena with a smile animated. Blair and Serena would spend the Christmas together in St. Barts. Blair's mother and father of Aaron were on honeymoon on a cruise in the Caribbean, and got to Blair, Aaron and brother of Blair, Tyler, pass the holidays in the exclusive resort of Isle La Paix in St. Barts. Each of them could bring a friend, if I wanted. Thus, after they reconciled in the bathroom during the wedding reception of the mother, Blair invited Serena. Of course it would be back in town for the Year-new. No girl in connection with more than 12 years like that of a ballad-passes the Year with new parents. - Vai be madness - Blair agreed with a smug smile. She could well be imagined, slip of sunscreen, with the new Missoni bikini on a beach of white sand rustic, his face masked by huge Chanel sunglasses, shorts while some of the cats brought surfing exotic drinks in coconut shells. She would forget to Yale, from Nate, and the mother of Cyrus and bake until brown as coffee with milk under the hot sun of the island. Of course she knew that Kati and Isabel were a total envy because she had not invited any of the two to go to St. Barts with her, but to be honest, Blair did not give the slightest. Just one more week. Chuck Bass Blair came from behind and put his hands on the shoulders and large hot naked her, tonificados the practice of tennis. - I just see the little girl that Nate and giving some of Constance amassos the corner-he announced, as if everyone wanted to know. Chuck was a nice way obscure means of comerial of post-shave lotion. It was also the most expensive chicken throughout New York. He tried to hurt Serena when she collapsed drunk in the hotel room of the family in his Tribeca Star in October and almost succeeded in that little Jenny Humphrey bear the dress for him in the bathroom of women at the party in Boca Kiss in the same week. Chuck was the worst type of chicken, but all have tolerate because he was one of them: attending a small private school for boys, in the primary, he went to the school of dance in the Arthur Murray and took tennis lessons at Asphalt Green, and sang in the church hotel on the beach front in the south of France. He was invited to the best parties and most exclusive private sales, like all others in the group. Even when he was rejected, Chuck yet again. He was mercilessly inespantável. Blair tried to remove his hands. - So?
<br> Chuck continued with their hands where they are. - Nate never managed to make you sell, right? - He began to massage her shoulders. - I was thinking that maybe the honor to be mine. The entire body of Blair rigid. Until that moment, she never had many problems with Chuck, but now understand why the Serena hated both. She pushed the chair back, hands violently expelling him from his shoulders and stood up. - I have to go to the bathroom, she announced to the table, completely ignoring Chuck. - Then we get out of here. We can continue the party at my house or something. Aaron got up and took a step toward her, the threading website skytech behind the ear, half embarrassed. - You okay? - He asked, looking worried. At that moment, every one act of Mr. Sensitive irritated Blair almost as much as the galinhagem to Chuck. - I'm great. She turned and marched across the room the best that could jump in the needle of acrylic Christian Louboutin and Gucci dress in black superapertado, looking directly to the front to prevent see Nate Ginny with that little girl, or whatever the hell is the name her. People were gathering on the track in an excited whisper. It seemed Flow - the lead singer of the world's most delicious music - was about to appear. But Blair does not matter. She was not drooling for famous people, like most of the girls. Did not need it: she was the star in the film that run on your head, the most famous person I knew. the cat's rock turns the head of all Jenny was a kind of trance blessed all night. Prior to accompany her to the prom Black-and-White, Nate wore a Donna Karan tuxedo again, Jenny pegara by taxi, led her to eat sushi and drink sake in very Bond and wish him a small turquoise pendant Jade Jagger in form the star. His green eyes spark to light the candles and golden hair that were so perfectly desgrenhados Jenny was taking for his mental polaróides that could paint a portrait brand new in the morning and increase its collection. Best of all was that, after they reached the ball, Nate not dragged to talk to people she did not know. Even the friends of turbulent Nate, Jeremy Scott Tompkinson, Anthony and Charlie Avuldsen Dem, left the two alone. That night Nate was just her, happy to hug her while they kissed silently in the corner. - You know the screen The kiss of Gustave Klimt? - Said Jenny excited while looking at the lovely face of Nate. Nate made a grimace. - Not really. - You know. It is famous for dammit. Anyway, this is what I remember. He has to shoulder and looked to the stage. - I think the guy the 45 will appear in a moment and speak something. Jenny encostou the wall. Before Nate, it would wet the panties of excitement to see a celebrity like Flow, but now all that I was still kissing Nate. - So? - She gave a giggle and a light hit in the mouth with the back of the hand, with care not to blur the brightness MAC pink. - That was awesome - she added short. - What? - Nate asked, looking distraught to the hall. - I never kissed so long well-accepted Jenny. Nate turned to her and smiled. He had smoked a joint on the way to get her way and was still stoned. He loved the dress that Jenny was wearing. It was long and black, the low neckline in front and back, with a frilled white dramatic that shaken tiny ankles. Jenny had bought the dress at Century 21, a tip of stock of clothing for fashion frequented by hunters of bargains and a notion that people desperately not buy anything that had label, even if it were obviously imperfect or was just a bad idea that the designer does not sell anywhere, except in the 21 Century.
