The last thing I wanted to see the world was entering the door of a nightclub while the cool-de-lion farm kindly asked her if it had not spent the time to go to bed. She should have gone with Nate floor. When they play more when they were alone than when they were with other people. - Nate? - She is bent forward and took his hand. - I should go home early. - I spent a little after midnight and she had to get home at a time, in any way. Contrary to popular belief, Nate was not completely dead to the world. He realized Blair is playing for that guy all the hair stuck magrelo never seen that before, and also realized that Jenny seemed a little uncomfortable. But when things get weird, Nate tends to leave the air and wait for someone else to take the initiative. - OK - he said, coming out of the trance. -Let 's get out of here. A marijuana that he brought was very smooth and he wanted to go to a noisy nightclub. After leaving Jenny at home, he could call the phone of Jeremy and to meet the boys in the bar Rivingtonwith black cozy room, where they could sit on the couch and smoking marijuana with no one to bother them. - Hey - he shouted, banging on the glass between the bank and the driver .- You can stop here? Blair smiled. Will had annoyed both the Nate wanted to leave because he could not see it with your hands on another man? - Oh, Natie. Do not want to go with us? - Serena asked. Nate has to shoulder. - I have to take Jenny home - he said. Jenny made a frown. The driver of the limousine stopped the car and opened the back door for them. Nate and Jenny jumped cambaleou beyond. - Bye! - She screamed excited for all that remained inside the car. Across the affected bank Chuck smiled at her, eyes a few cracks. - What Peninha - grunhiu him. Jenny was not sure what he meant, but I was sure that was something perverted. - See you! - Serena replied, the only person who really recognized that she was leaving. - Good luck in the tests! Nate and Jenny were in silence in the taxi during the race for the uptown. Nate was happy to see the shops and restaurants that passed zunindo, silently counting from one to twenty non-stop in your head of doid?o. Jenny sat with the legs crossed twice, backwards from what was wrong. It was mainly the fault of her, reasons. It was she who wanted a ride in the limo, to get started. The taxi stopped in front of the building of 99 with Jenny in the West End Avenue. She took the doorknob. - Hey - Nate said, touching the sleeve of her coat. He could not let her leave without a good night. Stoned or not, he had a good creation, and creation came with good manners. He kissed the face, the hair color of her skin ro?ando sand. - Good night - he said with a sweet smile child. Jenny return the smile, trying desperately to forget the last minute and pretend that the night had ended with the same perfection with which it began. - Good night - she said, suddenly reluctant to leave. - Sleep well - Nate said, eyes faiscando in green light. Ai. Sometimes he could be so incredibly adorable! With overflowing heart of true love, Jenny broke the door of the taxi and went to the lobby of the building. Instead of taking the elevator, she ran the eight flights of stairs and broke out in the apartment. - Hi - greeted, Dan, his older brother. Was coming from the corridor, taking two cups of Folgers instant coffee back to the room. -Hi. Jenny took the coat of black leather and fake shot in a chair in the corner. The jacket was hanging on the back of the chair for a second, then slipped to the floor. Nobody would understand it. The large apartment of four rooms no way effective cleaning for years. - How was it? - Dan asked The turquoise pendant in the shape of a star that Nate had it was hanging on his neck. Jenny touched him to calm down. - It was all right. - She looked at the mugs in the hands of Dan - Vanessa is still there? Dan seats. I could feel that something was taking. - You are. Want to come and stay with us a bit? Jenny and Dan gave it right, but it was not always so nice to her. - OK - she agreed, followed by the runner-up to his room. Vanessa was sitting in bed, even in black top and panties. - Hi, Jennifer. - She took a cup of coffee with Dan - I still want to get well, right? Jenny seats. Only Nate and Vanessa called to Jennifer. Nate did so was because she had when they met in the park. And because Vanessa had asked Jenny. Vanessa was always nice to her. When dealing with the respect. The bed was messed up to Dan and Vanessa were the clothes of the floor. It was clear to Jenny that Dan and Vanessa had fuck. Standing in the doorway, was constrained to move on. - Can I ask you a question? - She said finally. She did not know which of the two and was wondering, why did not care to have two answers. - Sure - Vanessa said, drinking coffee with their hands around the hot cup. - You can tell me honestly what you think of Nate? Dan wrinkle the forehead. He and Nate were not the same school, but by coincidence he went to Brown with Nate and Serena van der Woodsen and friends of Nate doid?es last month. So that could mean, Nate maconheiro was just a rich and beautiful. Nothing was wrong with him, but was not particularly special, too. Which means that Dan killed his sister was pretty smart and wasting time with a guy who would hurt her. But at the same time, Dan could understand why Jenny was so in love with Nate. He was older, first, and was the kind of guy with beautiful and popular girl who all want to leave. At least, until realizing how he was boring. Basically, Dan was the concern that ranheta Nate Jenny was pressing to do things she was not ready to do, but Jenny had arrived at home almost an hour before and did not seem upset or anything, so he decided not touch the subject. Vanessa has to shoulder. Nate was the type of idiotinha of preparatory school who lost no time, but she did not want to hurt the feelings of Jenny saying that. - I do not know him well, but all the girls of Constance always speak of him. I think I must make a good boyfriend. Dan seats. - Yeah. - That was the way to put the decent thing. Jenny wrinkle the forehead. - OK - she said, feeling more confused than ever. - I think I take a bath. She closed the door of the room and Dan went to the room. He gives a good boyfriend, repeated to herself. What the hell that mean? She wanted not only a good boyfriend. She wanted what Gustave Klimt had captured so perfectly in the kiss. That feeling of electric radiant and hug-me-if-not-strong-I-sank on who is in love. Well, not all is what we want, honey? we must be cruel to be kind At the time the limo encostou in Gorgona, the new nightclub in the trendy Lower East Side, Kati, Isabel and Chuck slept in a kind of twisted monturo of hair, scarves, bags, jackets and legs in the backseat of the limo. Blair, Serena, Flow, And Aaron Miles were on the sidewalk looking at them. - Thank God - said Blair. If I had to hear Kati or Isabel do more of a stupid and plates seuscomentários on how everything seemed purple or something, she would scream. - They seem dolls - Serena noted. - You want me to wake up? - Miles is offered. - No! - The two girls shouted in unison. - Hey, Miles - said Aaron. - This is not one of the clubs of his father? Miles corou and looked at his brilliant black Prada shoes. - It - Blair thought it was really cute way how he was embarrassed. - Legal - Flow spent the naked fingers around the fingers of enluvados Serena. Ready-to shake? Serena was feeling dizzy and that was crazy when I did not know well what would happen next. It was his feeling preferred. She shook his hand. - Definitely. They went to the door of the club. The lion-of-country house was pulling a red velvet rope for them to pass. - Wait - Blair said, stopping when reminded of the rude comment that Chuck had done earlier that night. Now it was the chance to have a sweet revenge and cheap. - You have a pen? - Flow dig up from the pocket of the tuxedo jacket of a black Sharpie felt the tip of the hand that had to give autographs. Blair is bent to the limo, with care not to rub the sleeve of the coat of the nose while Chuck wrote "Take this Mané home" on his forehead. Then hit the door of the limo. - Thank you. - She returned the pen to Flow. They passed by the huge lion-of-farm bearded and velvet rope. - Hmmm - Aaron said, hesitating. He opened and closed his Zippo. - I think I will go home. I have a lot of stuff to look tomorrow. Blair goggle. - So? I also have. - Want to go home with me? - Offered up Aaron.
<br> Blair looked at Serena, who shook his head inflexible. - Are you sure you want to go? - Asked to Aaron Miles. -It is very nice inside. And I can use the private room. - Other - Flow said with gratitude. Aaron shook his head. He was left and knew it.
