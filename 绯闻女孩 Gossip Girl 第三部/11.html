She was pessimistic and Dan was a romantic, and she could not understand why Dan had spun so disturbed with sex. For her, the more Dan and the more he hoped the oversized sex, writing poems about it and losing sleep for concern, most were for the disappointment. But she could not find a delicate way to do it see it unless it and tie up his clothes off. What it is bad idea. Vanessa smiled to herself and the thoughts turned to film. After the fish market she wanted to spend the day with one of those strips that ciclicstas always cycling in pairs by the Central Park and that never seemed to connect all the boys in Sheep Meadow were doid?es and beer bebessem age without having to do it. What she wanted was discovered was that they already arrested someone, or if you were trying to tone up the muscles of the legs with all those headed. Indeed, the police department that she probably would not film the police on a bicycle without any permission, but was not a bad idea at all. Finally, she wanted to go out with a hot dog vendor. See his house, the damília it, the dog. See if he had regular customers. If perhaps, while expecting that people buy hot-dogs, he read a book challenging, type The rainbow of the seriousness of Thomas Pynchon, and dreamed of leading men a day. Or maybe he just fiasse happy to be a seller of hot dog and eat hot dog every day for free. A movement in front of the room drew the attention of Vanessa. The lemingues of Constance were moving away from the chair of Serena. -Thank you, girls. And thank you, Serena - shouted Mr. Hanson. - Ten more minutes. Vanessa was looking as Serena again seperar earnestly the tips of the hair. Serena and Dan should have the movie star of War and Peace Vanessa last October. But Dan had agifo like an idiot around Serena and Vanessa could not bear, so she asked a girl who barely knew how to act the role of protagonist. In Serenaentrou of Dan, but only for five seconds. And before that Serena could cause a lot of damage, Vanessa attacked the head scraped the rulê collar and black boots to fight to restore his heart broken. Vanessa descruzou legs and crossed again. The idea of rescuing a bad Dan did want to love sex with him even more. She sighed impatiently. Holidays, she and Dan would spend much time together with little supervision of adults. Whether he was ready or not, it was only a matter of time before they did. Tá seeing? Despite the tough way for Vanessa and her disdain for the whole human species, it was not just another curious girl of 17 years. We are all equal. n can not stop thinking about butt of b Nate was in Jackson Hole lunch with Anthony Avuldsen, Charlie Dern and Jeremy Scott Tornpkinson in the interval between the evidence of calculating and chemistry. The proof of calculation had been quarry total and all were reloading with burgers, fries and Cocas to pass by the chemical, which probably would be much worse. Nate thought that the restaurant should invest in some of ceiling fans to remove the smell of fried onions that hangs in the air. He also thought about Jenny and Blair in that way not very defined and carefree that tended to use most of the things. Jennifer did not know of since the evening of Saturday, which was weird, because in general she sent text messages, small encrypted by phone or e-mails fresh short in his address to the St. Jude's School. Maybe she just was busy studying for tests. Nate and took away the plate of the Nokia pocket. Doeria not have anything for her a text message, just to keep morale high during the tests. Oh, how much consideration. Srt good!, He said. Qnta trde you lv cmprs bj N. Jeremu his arms stretched thin and turned his head to relax the neck. -Hey, who you 're telling the torpedo, man? - He was a little boy and a half idiot, so skinny that I could not keep the pants at the waist, but offset that with the haircut of the rock star of English and a way to talk about doid?o. Nate has the shoulders. -Nothing that is in your account. Anthony put a bunch of ketchup-soaked fries in the mouth. He played in almost all the sports teams of the St. Jude's, then you could eat chips all day and still continue curvy. -Hey, I noticed that Blair was very hot on Saturday night - he said. Nate assentiu while it had an image of the head butt mesh of Blair with the tight black dress. Blair was just fine. - Of course she does not have the teats of Jennifer - Antonhy added. The boys had stopped by Nate sacanear dating a student of eighth grade for some time, but from time to time made a reference to the enormous breasts of Jenny. It was hard not to make way. Nate smiled. After the forehead wrinkle, trying to remember how Jennifer was on Saturday, but just what came to mind was a jumble of brown curls, the neckline estupenso and his shy smile. He took a few drinks of Coca, the semicerrando look beautiful green and thinking hard. What actually happened very rarely. It was weird, but Nate never really sat down and compared the two girls. He loved to Jennifer - it was less demanding than Blair and a half that left with their own thoughts, while Blair always wanted to know in what he was thinking or where he went and with whom. Jenny did not pressure the way Blair did, like forcing him to apply for Yale so that they could live together near the campus or give him expensive gifts so that he felt obliged to reciprocate the gesture and buy something for it, too. And Jenny had those incredible breasts, while the Blair were only half there. Were legal, but not spectacular. Despite the defects of Blair, however, he always felt that the two actually knew - afianl, they were reared together. And throughout the time girlfriend, he felt that was going toward something. There was a destination, as the red pin that he thrust in nautical charts when it was in his boat in the port from somewhere. The destination was in part sexual - they did everything, but this was the obvious next step. The life of the two was in the same rhythm, separately, but together, as the floats of a Hobie Cat The two had 17 years. The two would be formed in June. The two went to college next year. He and Jennifer were in totally different rhythms and unfortunately the sex was not even on the horizon. She was 14. Next year, and for two years after that, she would wear the uniform and would go to the Constance Billard every day, while he was in college doing God knows what. Most people would be disconcerted by the difference in age, but Nate thought it means reassuring. While he was adrift in uncharted waters of the future, Jenny would be anchored securely at home. He could write to her, or call, or come back and see it and nothing would have changed. Charlie got the intact pickles with a fork and put in dish of Nate as a dead fish. -It seems that you are dry. Think pdoe chemical to prove? nate looked at him and shook the bag pl [Astico of marijuana in his pocket. Looked at the clock. -How about a quick fuminho before we go? The other three boys assentiram anxious. Nate smiled and stood up. I thought I had solved something in his head, but was not sure what it was. -Come on, he said. maybe kids are like clothes While the lessons of the second and third in the side of the Constance Billard began the tests, Jenny was in health class, discussing love, sex, shampoo and the peculiarities of the boys, among other things. Eleven girls sit in circles on the floor behind a sunny window in the cozy corner of a room that school classes designed especially for intimate, as the health of the last series of elementary school. The floor was a carpet carmine fuzzy green carpet instead of institutional resvestia the ground that the rest of the school. The walls were painted in a lively blue-knapwood, with the edges in white flashing. There was a small blackboard without frame, with very colorful chalk, draw diagrams for the teacher and, most important, had no portfolio, allowing the girls to relax the body and actually speak to them to move the head. Who gave lessons to the class was Miss. Doherty, a professor of dance New Age hippie who was 25 years old, a beautiful body by tonificado yoga, reddish-brown hair long and a pale face that was always entirely without makeup. It was the only professor in the department of physical education that was not fully shoe, and the girls would love your way calm and open if it were not for the trend that was embarrassing to talk in parts of the body as did the family dog. The Miss. Doherty left the girls who choose the topic of discussion, then they usually spent much of the lesson talking about boys. -Honestly, I do not understand how we can meet people of the opposite sex when we get most of the time in environments full of girls - complained about Kim Swanson. She fell in the hands carefully perfectly dyed brown hair, lights that were once a month at the John Barrett Salon since the second series. Jenny was sitting close to Kim, marvel because it was all perfect. The nails well-cared for, the brozeado artificial gold, the basis Chanel subtly applied, eye shadows and gloss on the lips, ears Cartier earrings and white cotton blouse Agnés B. Maybe, if Kim was not so long passase producing, had more time to know the boys. The Miss. Doherty has a quiet smile and benevolent. -I know it is difficult, Kim - said she solidarity. - Only I can suggest is to involve itself in any of those activities interescolares mixed, like theater or choir. And if your friends have friends boys, do not be shy ... have to ask you! -Miss. Doherty, think we have to love the guy who is with us? - Jessica said Soames, who looked exactly the snow of the fairy tales, the hair and black, and red lips and eyes full of gray hairs long, but definitely was not pure as the snow. Jessica had menstruado in the third set and said they had lost their virginity in the fifth. Originally, it is that had the biggest heart of the class, but last year the breasts of Jenny exceeded that of Jessica. The Miss. Doherty put a fuse of stubborn hair behind the ear and smoothing the brown eyebrows, obviously trying to prolong the discussion. But before he could do anything, little Jenny Humphrey expressed. -It, definitely. I mean, maybe take some time for the two realize they are in love, but if you're not, then I think you should finish. The whole class, including Miss. Doherty, the consistently. The Miss. Dohrty was facing because Jenny Humphrey never spoke in class and she did not know that Jenny was so full of opinions. The girls saw because all knew that Jenny can steal Nate Archibald from Blair Waldorf, which was even surprising, and had not have done it as Jenny unless it was trance, and very. Does Jenny Humphrey was even more piranha, secretly, than Jessica Soames? And now she admitted that? When he realized that all looked to, Jenny corou. -I mean, I do not think they have to finish if you have not said''I love you'', maybe because you are still together and everything and are only waiting for the right moment to talk. The Miss. Doherty gave their seats and smile without lipstick. Love was one of her favorite topics.
