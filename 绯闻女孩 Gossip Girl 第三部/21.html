Then she laughed and started running, slipping and sliding up the hill by the lake frozen. Nate heard this time. He dropped the bag and began running after her. - Hey! Querro I see that thong! - He shouted with voice vampire. Jenny winch and continued to run. Her eyes grow damp and the cold breath was stuck in the throat. Nate chased across the ice covered with snow, where the feet of Jenny skulk underneath it, falling estatelada under a large oak adorned with long pendants of ice crystal. He threw it up as a pump and two rolled, breathless and laughing grudando snow in hair. Nate Jenny turned face down and pulled the coat it. - Let me see, let me see! - He shouted, holding a pair of black velvet Jenny from behind and pulling them down to have a glimpse of butt naked. - Wait! - Jenny yelled, laughing and winches. She closed his eyes hard, unable to hold any longer. Hold on. Nate, I love you. Nate was stopped for a moment, absorbing the information. Then, instead of it will come, kiss her and say that I loved her, he blew a loud and bonitinhas the pink cheeks of her ass and then turned back, exhaled clouds of hot air to the cold blue sky. Jenny was estatelada for a few seconds, catching my breath. Then he put the foot and arranged the clothes. I was happy to have finally spoken, but it would have been more cool if Nate said the same thing. He should have said "I love you" and then taken in a horse sleigh to the land of nuncca. But just what Nate did was make a bang-of-mouth in the ass naked Jenny. - You are not using the underwear with the sail, are you? - She asked full of hope, trying to keep the game as it had begun. - I know there. - Nate unfasten the belt. Arriou his trousers to the hips. Chess-blue. Sorry. - OK - Jenny responded quickly, pulling jacket around the body. - Hey - she said, changing the subject. - Go to the statue of Romeo and Juliet. It is my favorite and is on the way. Nate spent much time in the park, but had no idea what she was talking about. - What statue of Romeo and Juliet? Jenny rub your hands with your hands. - Forget lá.Vou show you when we arrive. -Are you cold? - Nate asked, based on the elbows and taking her hand. - Come here. Jenny hesitated for a second and then lowered. Nate pulled up to him and passed it underneath the arms of his jacket, kissing the forehead and then each of her cheeks pink and cold. She spent the lips on his chin and could not resist saying again. Maybe, just maybe, he had not heard the first time. -I love you - she whispered. This time Nate had to respond. He was embraced with her and Jenny looked in his eyes green with its large brown eyes, waiting. And they had just finished watching the nutcracker, the love of God, it was a love story, in case you do not remember. - I love you too - he muttered. After they kissed for a long time. The red hat of Jenny fell and its dark-brown curls fell on his face, hiding it. But not very well. Dan said to Vanessa that films it needed more action. Well, here was finally some action. Yes, the icicle were excellent, superb. But how many times you via a woman with the butt out in the snow? How many times have you by a guy totally tidy arriando pants in the full light of day in the middle of winter? And how many times you via a couple rolls in the same coat in the frozen lake in the middle of the city's busy world? If Vanessa had at least one helicopter, and she would have shot over the path, up until then that the couple were just a tip in the middle of the grid of Manhattan. But she had no helicopter, then would have to be creative in the assembly. Best of all was that she had not given a full zoom on the face of the couple, then they could be anyone of any age - you with your boyfriend or your grandmother with her boyfriend. It was pure poetry, rough and beautiful. She could barely wait to show Dan Wait. Will it do so before or after to show him what it has under the collar rulê black wool skirt and black? Ia isla bonita The Isle of IaPaix resort on the island of St. Barts, it was the kind of place where are the celebrities who want to hide the women and middle-aged society in New York who want to and recover from a plastic surgery. Unless someone is or know someone, you can not stay there. But by coincidence Cyrus Rose, the stepfather of Blair, had a builder who had done the resort, and so the three villages that he and Blair reserved for mother of the family were the best of all. The village of Blair and Serena had a deck surrounding the house which could see the resort's pool, where women over forty years with surgically enhanced breasts and thighs surgically reduced lie in hammocks using sunglasses and huge loop without JEANS , pretending to read magazines while taking a French fashion drunk with rum punch in the house. One of the women had a small Bichon emphasizes, and even the dog was wearing sunglasses. Across the deck, they could see the stretch of perfect white sand beach, where women were taking more new sun of topless and men velejavam lightly in the windsurfing boards, pretending not to see. The sea was so clear and in a tone of blue-green that seemed so perfect false. Serena is seated on the porch, smoking a Gitane and browsing the French Elle, hoping that Blair got it before finding the other in the dining room for a late lunch. She had washed her hair, which fell on the shoulders and naked on the back of his top yellow Diane von Furstenberg. After the bath, she became one of self tanning lotion Lanc?me throughout the body and the skin had acquired a healthy golden brown. The tiny mini-skirt of denim Agnes B. poorly covered the thighs, and feet were a pair of sandals from strips of white leather encrusted crystals. Near the grade of the deck, a hummingbird sugava the pollen of a hibiscus, a flower adejando the other. Serena wondered why was not a single flower, and take a good long drink and instead of getting it moving much. Good question. - Hello? Forgiveness? - Serena heard a man say with a French accent. She erased the cigarette with the soles of sandals and stood up. A man using a shirt Isle of Ia Paix was stopped at the foot of the staircase of the deck, holding a huge bouquet of flowers tropical rare. - ?a e'est pour vous, mademoiselle - he announced, bringing the flowers up and deliver them to Serena. My God. Will Flow were spies or something? How did he find? Serena took the flowers and smell. - Thank you. - No problem - he replied. He was almost turning around when Blair opened the screen door of the village and went to the deck. - It is better that my mother has an account on the bar she said Serena even before realizing the c.ara.Blair was using a take-it-fall of Jersey beige silk which was almost the same color of your tan Lanc?me. By far, it seemed that was completely naked. Feet had a pair of red rubber sandals she had bought at the drugstore, and she put a fake diamond ring in the left big toe, trying a new visual garbage-wealthy. She saw the face of the resort looking for her. - Yes? - Asked. - Parlez-vous anglais? The man seemed embarrassed. - Sorry. I just wanted to say "welcome" the two most beautiful girls on the island. Fortunately, his accent was very sensual. It was the only way he can get out of saying something completely brega. - Thank you. See you later - Blair said, with him. - Enjoy the flowers, mademoiselle - said the man, seat for Serena. Then he laughed again and went to Blair. Blair penteou the hair with your fingers and espiou the sea. I was getting kind of boring lead singing of every man who passed by. Serena put the flowers on the table of rattan in the middle of the deck. - Who are they? - Asked Blair. Serena has to shoulder. - Do not think you should ask. Blair went to the table and got the card in a glass vase square where the flowers were. - "Have wonderful holiday and did not stress too much with the wedding plans", read it aloud. - "Love, your dear friends K and L" Blair and Serena is looked and exploded in laughter. Serena was really relieved to discover that maybe you did not warrant Flow all those present. The snowman and chocolate basket full of baby barracudas, for example. Kati and Isabel Perhaps they also have warrant. Come on - she took the arm of Blair, pulling it to the staircase of the town. -We will leave Cyrus in paying a drink! And Aaron Miles were playing backgammon in the bar and trying to get Tyler ate fried mussels. The mother of Cyrus and Blair were still sailing on the yacht of someone, then had not seen those yet. The dining hall of the resort was not really a hall, but a large covered deck facing the beach and the sea perfectly blue-green. On one side of the deck, there was a bar of bamboo and glass, with white leather seats. Very modern tropical chic. - Two Cocas with rum, please - Blair said in French to the bartender. The good to be a French island was that you did not need to worry about showing identity. Not that she showed to her very often. Serena took the drink and hit the glass in the Blair. - We - offered her. After the two threw his head back and drank only a sip. - Wow - Miles muttered, looking at Blair with admiration. He was wearing a black Armani pants over polo shirt and a cement-gray Armani and looked pale, now that was out of town. - How to do it without a burp then as truck driver? Blair laughed and wiped his lips with the back of the hand. - Practice. Aaron shook his head. His skytech seemed more appropriate now, with the beach in the background. He put his hands in the pockets of the shorts over the olive. - Do not know if this is cause for pride. Blair goggle. - So it seems that you never drink. Aaron has to shoulder. - I drink. Only I prefer to drink water when I'm thirsty. Tyler has a bite in the mussels and then spat on the cocktail napkin. - And Blair drink all - he joked. Blair was about to hit him, but then saw his mother and walking the docks Cyrus. Cyrus holding the elbow of Eleanor as if worried that it stumble. If it were anyone else, Blair could have thought it was sweet, but nothing in their view of what Cyrus did was sweet. Eleanor wore a dress garish pink and green Lilly Pulitzer white cover of frogs would be better if all of a color and a bit more cover your legs not too thin. The hair with lamps were tied with a strip of linen white, and his face was deeply tanned. Cyrus was with linen trousers and a red folds of striped polo shirt of navy blue and white. His face was red and glowed, and he could not look more pigs. What does "like a pig" for those who have evil in the test of verbal ability. Eleanor Waldorf Rose winch when he saw there at the bar. - Hi, guys! - She screamed, running and giving a tight hug Tyler.Ela in the ditch and was shot at Blair. - I miss many of you. And I have so much to tell! Serena smiled politely. - Hi, Mrs. Rose - the mother of Blair was eccentric way, but was much less arrogant that the mother of Serena. Cyrus shook the hand of Aaron. - Good to see you, son. I called my lawyer, then I think you and Blair managed to not burn the building while we were away. Aaron laughed. - Ah, fire. We are building a new for you now. Vai see when I get back. Vai is very nice. Blair decided to some fun too. Or maybe she was just drunk. - I'm pregnant - she said. She put his arm around Miles. - This is Miles. He is the father. The laughter vanished from the face of Aaron. - Since when you comedian? - Eleanor asked, tilt the head of surprise to the sense of humor of obscene daughter. Blair took the arm of the shoulders of Miles and shot the mother a wry smile. - Since I was kicked out of Constance. Serena laughed. - It is a cascateira. Cyrus took Blair to the fleshy foot and pulled a hug. - Someone is in a good mood! - He said. No more. Dropping Blair, Cyrus did signal to the bartender. - Champagne for all! Blair estremeceu. Brega that thing. Eleanor gave a pat on the belly. - Not for me, honey. When she refused champagne? - Sobra more for us - Cyrus Blair blinked and went to the bowls for Aaron, Blair, Serena, and Tyler Miles. Eleanor gave a glass of soda and then put the cup in front of him. - Our big happy family - offered him, laughing like a fool. Blair had had enough of family for today. - We can sit down to eat? - Gemeu it. - I'm hungry - had not provided the mother vomit and Cyrus left, but was with a feeling that anything you eat today would not be there for long. They were flock to the hall, dining outdoors and if the stools sat on a white leather. A ceiling fan circulating lazily in a light breeze and ran the leaves of palm trees around. All, except Aaron, asked hamburgers. It was a French restaurant and there was only one vegetarian dish on the menu. - I just want salad and chips - he said the waiter, lighting a cigarette in their natural special. - We had a honeymoon wonderful - Eleanor spoke excited, going on a roll and butter devouring it as if you were stuck on an island for weeks without any food. Much weight since she left in honeymoon Blair was asked whether that should give a hint. But I am happy that you have coming, boys. Cyrus shook the arm of her. - And your mother and I have a big surprise for you - he said, blue eyes more than ever the bulbs. Eleanor put their fingers full of diamonds in fatty hips. - Shhh - she said. - Only at Christmas. Aaron Blair felt the knee of your leg touching under the table and, in time to depart, he left there. It was one of her small pleasures misapplied - the esbarr?o casual knee, her hand ro?ando to him when she took the bread, the smell of it in your ear when she sighed of boredom. He knew that Blair had finished bathing, although her hair is dry, because it smelled like your favorite shampoo, coconut, Kiehl's. He also noticed that her skin was more golden than when they were on the plane, then she obviously used some kind of tanning lotion to come soon after that. He knew that her fingernails were painted in pink and clear that she was no clock. And he hated to see these things, because things were a brother should not repair. Tyler viewed discouraged their Coca-Cola. I have a stamp of discs a day and make clips for MTV. Not only was 11anos only have a bag of age and have to spend the holidays with his family instead of going to Ozzfest, but also all the other had a friend there unless it. - No heats up, man - Aaron said, noticing the lower lip of the projected half-brother. - As we eat, Miles and I will take you to do jet-ski. Tyler caught a straw cup and tried to light it with the Zippo of Aaron. - Legal - he said, trying to keep the image of poor while using short cáqui of folds absurdly nerd and a green Lacoste shirt. Then the food arrived, and Cyrus and Eleanor began to speak of the highlights of the cruise honeymoon. Last week they went up and saw a volcano-rays sandpaper in Martinique. In St.Johns, Cyrus bought for an Eleanor of coral and diamond brooch that had been found on a ship in Virgin Gorda naufragado.E they have cocktails with Albert Finney, who supposedly was a very famous old actor that none of them ever heard . Serena is turned off. She and Blair were sitting in front of the beach, and the sky above the water a seaplane made a loop and plunged. It soon became clear that the plane wrote letters in the sky. How did that? And it would be fun if the pilot was semi-illiterate? Semicerrou her eyes when I read the word is drawing in the sky, assuming that would be in French. S-E-R-E-N-A.
