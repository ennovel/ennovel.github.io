But she would not be hammering it. It was not that type. Oh, yeah, okay then. - I believe more in fate - she said to Serena, lowering the crystal flute with a thud on the table and almost breaking the rod. Blair spent the fingers in the long dark-brown hair that had been trimmed by Antoine that day, his new favorite hairdresser Elizabeth Arden Red Door Salon. Serena laughed and goggle blue. - So, how do you always said that their destination was Yale? - This is different - Blair insisted. Blair's father had gone to Yale and Blair always dreamed to go there too. She was the first of the class in Constance Billard and extracurricular activities was leaving the cover, then try the early admission seemed an obvious choice. But during the interview, she collapsed and Blair became the Queen of Drama at the Cinema. Told the interviewer a touching story of how her mother had been divorced from her father was gay and about to marry a man she barely knew, and was dying to get into college and start a whole new life. And then she kissed the interviewer - in fact, was tiptoe and kissed on the cheek haggard and Erica hair! Blair has always imagined the heroine of a movie black and white of the 1950s, with Audrey Hepburn style, his idol. That time had been his ruin. Now she was required to apply for regular admission to Yale with all others, and came to talk with his father to donate a study program to Yalena France as a way to give a forcinha for her. But their chances to get in there still were, at most, skinny ones. Blair took a bottle of Cristal in the bucket of silver in the middle of the table and filled the cup. - Destination is for manés - she said. - Just a silly excuse to let things happen rather than destroy them to happen. If at least she knew exactly how to make things she wanted the case even without completely screw with them. The attention of Serena was shorter than that of a newborn puppy and elajá was too drunk to have a serious talk. - No more going falardo future, okay? - She lit a cigarette and blew the smoke in the air above the head of Blair.Sabe that is, that blond guy who is talking to you is seeing oAaron total there are about ten minutes. - She covered the mouth with long, slender fingers and laughed. - Epa. Here they come. Blair has turned and with his half-brother of vegetarian skytech, Aaron Rose, and a guy with very high spindly blond hair and brown eyes, clear, wearing an Armani tux wonderfully well-done, going to table them. The boy beat her fingers nervously supercompridas legs and look at Christian Dior black shoes and bright as if you were worried about tripping on them or something. Behind the two boys, the dance floor inchava of beautiful girls and boys beautifully dressed adorably elegant, in the arms of a neck of another, with a rocking music of Beck. - Say something legal for Blair - the Aaron said Serena. - She is estressando with the future.
<br> Blair goggle. - Who is not? The lips thin and red of Aaron has now down a mug of who apologizes. He, Blair and Serena had come to the dance together, and since they arrived, Aaron left the two girls drinking and smoking cigarettes while he would find friends. But Blair went anxious middle and sentimental lately with the marriage of the parents, the interview at Yale repulsive and everything. She needed all the moral support he could get. - Sorry. I have been a good companion. Want to dance or something? Blair ignored the. She was with the guy who wanted to dance? She looked at the tall, blond friend of Aaron. - Who are you? The poll gave a giggle. His teeth were even more than the white shirt. - I'm Miles. Miles Ingram. Son of Danny Ingram, owner of the famous restaurants and clubs, owner of the fashionable places such as Gorgona Trixie in New York and in Los Angeles, to name a few. - He is my colleague in the class Bronxdale - Aaron added. - We are building a band. Miles plays drums. Blair bebericou the champagne, hoping they would say something that was not completely boring. Miles gave a giggle and monkfish Blair to the fingers on the back of an empty chair. - You are more beautiful than I thought - he said. He was cute, but fingers batucantes that business could be seriously annoying. Blair did not return the smile. She took a drink. Aaron Miles probably said it was a total witch, and he hoped that she had warts on the nose and a broom in the ass. Not exactly. Aaron did not like to talk about his new half-sister because I wanted to save it for yourself. But do not pull the network yet - we will get there later. Aaron pushed the skytech behind the ears. - And this is Serena - he said to Miles. Miles has only a quick peek at the perfectly chiselled face, the deep blue eyes, long and thin in the body and the great black Gucci dress for Serena. His eyes fell on it for a moment - it was hard not to fall-, before turning to Aaron. - How weird. You have not told me that Blair was so beautiful. Aaron has to shoulder and seemed uncomfortable. - Sorry. Blair and Serena kindled new cigarettes, still hoping that something crazy happened. Considering the observation that Blair had just done on the destination, was to make them happen. Aaron pigarreou. - Are you sure you do not want to dance? - Asked him to Blair again. Blair realized that he was wearing tie-butterfly and that the tuxedo shirt was unbuttoned and unfolded the collar. Apparently, he was saying something. She gave a long shot in the cigarette and blew the smoke in his face.
