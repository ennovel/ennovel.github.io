It was a polite kiss of gentleman.

<br> Blair was trying to maintain the attitude or not-to-there-of Serena.Ela could do that. I could have fun with a man casually whatever was nothing like Nate. Moreover, after that night, she was not needed to see Miles again if not wanted. She gave a coy smile. - I think we are fools - she said, raise the chin while Miles to kiss again. And this time the kiss was nothing polite. In more or less three thousand words, write about a person that has inspired you deeply.

I mean, I do. Hi, guys! The famous are even more interesting than ordinary people? We talk as if they met. We read everything that falls on them in our hands. We were sad when they go through a difficult phase or happy when they marry or earn an Oscar. Criticize the haircut of them, when they realized fatten or weight loss, until we have the fantasy of being friends of them. And of course they have beautiful clothes, lots of houses and carte blanche to all the new restaurant of fashion. But we also have. The truth is that the only thing that makes the famous interesting is that they are famous. Unless, of course, that they really are interesting as ... well, like me, for example. Flagra S and Flow - is that Flow, we have received the MTV Music Award for best debut of disk - dancing done some crazy monkeys in Gorgona on Saturday night.

Blair was in the front row, close to the inspector, who by chance was the jerk of a professor of cinema, Mr. Beckham, it also by chance desprezava because he had a C in the last article on cinema. The article was about the films of Woody Allen and as they do not identify with most American viewers because they were not in New York and were not the neurotic who lived there. Now, despite being the Midwest, Mr. Beckham was fanatic by Woody Allen. He called the article by Blair to''condescending''. That stupid. The race began with a series of issues that had to be answered in a brief descriptive paragraph. The first question was: Qu'est-ce que vous voulez faire pendant votre temps libre? "What you do in your free time?" That was beyond easy. Blair liked to buy shoes extraordinarily well designed and expensive, eating steak with fries, drinking Ketel One with tonic with Serena and smoking too much. In the summers she liked tennis. Nate used to kiss in bed while Jennifer luxury rolava DVD in the background, but now was not more so. She was too busy doing all other things. The next question was: Decrivez votre famille. "Describe your family." Blair released a sigh of despair. It was almost fluent in French, then she knew the words to "homosexual futile", "crazy fool" and "Mané fat and omega", which was describe as the sincerity with father, mother and stepfather. But Madame Rogers, his teacher of French, had no sense of humor, then it was unlikely that impressed with the description of Blair. Instead, Blair generously described his father as an "elegant companion whose favorite hobby is the same as mine: buy shoes", the mother as "a good kind of blonde who forgot the name if no one remembered for her" and stepfather as "a happy man with a chuckle and an unusual taste for clothes, "The brother, Tyler, was easy:" It can be very beautiful when growing, but the best friends it is the PlayStation 2 and the collection of discs of the 1980s. "And Aaron remained. Blair made a break for a second. Elagostava of Aaron, although he was acting in a quiet environment and taciturn lately. In the scale of half brother he could have been much worse. Blair smiled and said with herself, my new half-brother, Aaron, you'll probably save the world. Ready. They were just the coolest things I would say about someone. The next question was: Imaginez qu'un djinn appears sur votre épaule pour vous dire qu'il vous a accordera seul want. Quel serait votre want? Blair batucou the number two pencils on the table of wood. What would she ask? She wanted to get into Yale, is obvious. And wanted her mother and Cyrus were on honeymoon forever for it to not have to live with them or see them if passionate kissing in public all the time. She wanted Nate is changed to the Antarctic to never have to touch him or that his girlfriend. She also wanted a pair of very leather boots with caramel jump 10 mosey; only had not yet found the right pair. And a sheep-jacket. And one of fox fur hat with ears coverage. She does not really care who the father was gay, but he wanted to find a boyfriend to live in New York rather than in France, so that he could take her to shop more often. And Serena wanted to be the class of advanced French to close that they feel during the race tickets and go crazy on all the stories that newspapers today count on Serena and Flow. It also means that he wanted her and Nate had followed in front and back when they were together so it was not more virgin. And it means that I have not been agreed to so late on Saturday with Miles, Flow and Serena, because it was still half of hangover. Moreover, Miles had called her twice yesterday and left messages on the answering machine, although she had given to him specifically a false number to never hear about it. Until now was thinking about resuming the links. Saturday night was fun, but the last thing they needed now was a new boyfriend.
