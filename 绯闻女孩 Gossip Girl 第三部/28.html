The town that Blair and Serena was divided to only six feet away - was not far enough, in which concerned Blair. She became the villages and taken to the beach, and when your feet stepped on the sand, she began to run. Blair did not care to be commissioned especially the pink dress at Calypso and have paid about $ 150 more for it. She ran as quickly as he could until the water and threw it in the waves, ruining the dress. Taking a big gush of air, she sank, impelling the body forward with the full force of his arms and legs. Then, when the lungs were about to explode, she rose to the surface, flashing and arfando with salt water in your eyes. The moon shone and the music of the feast of Christmas Eve ecoava in the water. The 45 had stopped and a DJ played Blame It on the Boogie, a classic Michael Jackson. On the beach, Blair could see the vague silhouette of a girl, her feet tapping in shallow water, looking Halle Berry in a new day to die, but with the long blond hair and wearing a white bikini instead of a orange.
<br> It was clear that Serena. - Where the Miles? - Serena shouted, putting his hands emconcha mouth. - And who cares? - Blair responded, entering naágua. - Where the Flow? - And who cares? - Serena replied. The two laughed and Blair boiou back for a few seconds, watching the moon. Then she turned and swam toward Serena. - I am thinking of returning tomorrow - she said, leaving the water. I had to write a script and wanted to work there without the pregnant mother, the half-brother or friend weird stalker him around to bother her. Serena knew it was better not to ask what had happened. - But tomorrow is Christmas, she noted. - Your mother will not be upset? Blair squeeze water from the hair and the water fell in the sand, leaving a trail behind you. - As if I care. In addition, Cyrus is Jewish. The two girls walked slowly back to the beach town, enjoying the company of one another and the reassuring sounds of waves breaking on the beach. If at least could be walking forever. When they finally reached the village, they discovered the it seemed like a great iron cage covered with a layer of red and white listradinha waiting for them at the door. Cream Happy! Serena took the handle of the cage and took bronze in. He put the cage on the table-to-head and pulled the hood while Blair light the lamp. Within the cage was a parrot beautiful green and blue with yellow beak perched on a thin ring of wood. The parrot with Serena blinked his eyes to the account. - I love you, Serena! I love you, Serena - hoists him. - Marry me. Marry me. Blair laughed. - Do you think that is Kati and Isabel? Serena laughed too. - I know there. It has no card. - I love you, Serena! Marry me. Marry me - said again and shook the parrot feathers. Serena put the cover back and moved away from the cage. Flow could be irreparably pretty generous and flattering, but it was getting too much. She looked at Blair. - Know what you said about leaving tomorrow? - It? - Blair took the dress drenched dire??odo basket and shot in the corner. Serena went to the closet and pulled the bag from Kate Spade daprateleira up. - Be ready when you are.

So, huh, V: porn on the Internet today, tomorrow the Festival de Cannes! The other e-mails Q: hi, gg, I have to tell you that I knew Back to the drugs. All that rumor that she and Flow are engaged is completely false. The real reason for her to go to St. Barts was to find a dealer for it to bring a full load of things to sell. But everyone should know that. - Insider A: Hi, insider, You must be right. I heard that she is thinking of drop-in spree in New Year too. But do not forget, she still has to pass through the airport security. - GG Q: Dear Gossip Girl, I have a house in Mt Desert, Maine, and met some friends there to do even tobogganing N.

One last wish So I had achieved all my list of Christmas, until my orange Hermes Birkin bag. I know you think I am mimada, but I deserve it. What we still can not, because still missing six days, is a New Year's Eve, which transformed his life. Let's hope that S gives even a party, and who knows - may even appear Flow! See you at midnight! For you who love me, gossip girl prisoner of the towerStuck in a house with nothing to do except read and daydream, Jenny felt a Rapunzel, but with shorter hair and bigger breasts. She kept the white satin thong from the bottom drawer of underwear until the next time we saw Nate. The New Year's Eve, was not far away and maybe she had not expected so much. Basically she hoped that he was very miss her, which returned to Maine and if esgueirasse in her room in the middle of the night by a fire ladder. Imagine that it would again kept busy for hours. Poor Nate, arrested in Maine full of snow and cold. Yesterday was Christmas, and he probably spent all day watching old movies with parents, from time to time looking at the snow and wondering when it would hear her voice again. Jenny is not mattered not to talk to him on the phone - this forced separation was only letting his love much stronger - but still had to do something to show that Nate loved and believed in him but as ever. And that is why she decided to send a package of memories for him. First she found an old box of Nike shoes, she took the sheet of tin. Then put a copy in booklet of Romeo and Juliet, from Shakespeare, in the box. The suffering of the tragic lovers in the play was very similar to them: they were deeply in love and were forbidden to see, and yet won the love at the end. It is clear that she and Nate would not die, as Romeo and Juliet. They casariam, would have a large family and grandchildren to tell stories about how they met in the park on a sunny day of autumn when the forces of the universe were perfectly aligned. Then Jenny added a package of two tin of blueberry Pop-Tarts to the box. They were his favorite food, but rarely ate, because I had too much calories and no nutritional value. But she liked the idea of eating something that Nate loved her and miss her. Jenny then put a picture of her that Dan had taken the previous summer. She wore a sleeveless yellow dress and was standing on the edge of a pool of a hotel in Hershey, Pennsylvania, where the Rufus had taken to spend a weekend. Jenny liked were brilliant with their hair in the photo, and how the arms bronzeados cover the sides of the breasts in a way that could not be said that were so large.
