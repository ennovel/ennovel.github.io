In the male department, Nate showed her a pair of gray merino wool socks. - How about that? - Half? But I want to give you something special. Something with ... spirit - Jenny insisted. Panache, was what she wanted to say. Panache. He had seen that was used in Vogue, and seemed so French and so sophisticated. Nate returned the half and looked the store. - I do not want you to spend lots of money with me, Jennifer. Jenny triumphant smiled at him, loving him more than ever. She loved the way he called Jennifer. I loved the small bonitinhas of text messages he sent him by phone. I loved how he did things, like kissing her hand. And, best of all, loved the feeling that he gave him with a few words with his sensual voice, as if it were the most lucky girl of Barneys, and that really meant something. - There can be only half - she insisted. - You must be special. - Okay - Nate responded with a shoulder to the fun. It was cute way that Jenny wanted to buy him anything more meaningful than socks or perfume. She was so generous and genuinely never expected anything in return. - This here? - Jenny erected for a short wool flannel with Scottish cord. - I think should be in his pajamas. Nate wrinkle the forehead. - It means gay - he said. Jenny put the shorts back on the shelf. - You are right. Sorry - after she saw a table with piles of underwear-samba song with silk-screen images in the rear. There was a samba-song with a sailboat in red silk. What perfect. Sailing was the thrill of Nate. He even built sailboats in Maine. The shorts cost $ 60, and was more than she wanted to spend and other means to underpants, but Jenny was willing to give up ten dollars for the man she loved more than anyone or anything else in the world. - This is great - Nate built the underwear and examined the boat. - But I think nobody is going to see. A jet flushing rose by neck of Jenny when she thought of underwear to see Nate. - No, but it has to be his - she insisted. - It is so totally you. She doubled the drawer and took her to the counter. - You can gift-wrap, please? - She turned to Nate. - It's more fun if you open as a gift, really. - The brown eyes shone in her excitement. Jenny had a lovely boyfriend, bought him a present very cool and he was smiling at her like that that will be made to shout: I'm so happy! She went to Nate a black sacolinha of Barneys. - Happy Hanykkah - said it all happy, but were only half Jewish and Nate was not anything Jewish. - Thanks, Jennifer - Nate did not expect to find something you really like, but until he found the cute underwear. He took her hand. - Now we buy something for you. Come on. He took her to the elevator and the sixth floor. Jenny did not know where they were going until the doors were opened and they went out in the lingerie department. She hesitated. Nate imagined that she buy something cute for Christmas, like a scarf with a reindeer or something stupid. But not lingerie. - Choose what you want - Nate said. Jenny looked at the shelves of imported lingerie made by hand, his face red with shame. She always bought Bali bra at Macy's because it had extra support and extralargas strips to prevent the weight of their breasts estupendos leaving marks on the shoulders. It seemed that the suti?s shred of Barneys would be if she put them just a breast, and even more the two. There was no way to get her a bra, a bustiê and not even a top. First, she would die if Nate discover the size of them. Second, they probably were not beautiful things and income in the size of it. Jenny wanted to be able to say that Nate did not want any lingerie, but did not want to hurt his feelings. Instead, she got a simple white silk panties from La Perla costoura with a pink and a pink satin ribbon of the elastic. - This here is legal. - I want a matching bra with it? - Grasnou a seller of some 17 years, zanzando there to help. - No - Jenny practically shouted. She took the panties and the hanger doi until the balcony so that Nate could pay and they left them running away. The box got the panties and started to wrap it in paper. - Only the thong, miss? - She asked. Jenny looked at a piece of white silk in the hands of women. I could see that basically remained the area's ass.
