Blair wore thong all the time. He did not understand why Jenny was so embarrassed. When the package was ready, delivered to the Nate and Jenny kissed on the face. - Merry Christmas. Jenny prying eyes of the sentence in the carpet that looked fixedly cream and got the bag. Here was something that she loved in Nate - he is not surprised at how things varias thong. He was always calm and cold. Well, it is difficult not to be calm environment when stoned most of the time. As the elevator descended, Jenny is asked what should be done now. Go home and parading with the present one to the other? Just the idea of walking from one side to another before Nate out with the butt of Jenny did want to die. The elevator door is opened. - I was thinking that we could go walk to the St. Regis - Nate said while passing by the cosmetics department, the road to exit the store. The heart to beat erratically Jenny chest. The St. Regis was a hotel. Oh, my God. - Have a great pub there. We could take a hot chocolate or something - Nate added. It seemed that he genuinely wanted a hot chocolate, not a showzinho erotic in a hotel room. Jenny sigh of relief. - Sounds good right. But before reaching the front door, Nate saw two girls, one with blond hair pulled up in a tail-to-horse and the other with brown hair that fell costas.Eram by Serena and Blair, standing at the counter of Estée Lauder, well on the way of them. Nate put his arm around Jenny and started to take it in the opposite direction, back to the shop for a male and exit different. Not that it matters to be seen with ela.Só would be easier if they had to talk to anyone, especially with Blair. Jenny hesitated and made a face at him. - Wait. Where are we going? - She asked, confused. - Hmmm, I think perhaps I should get a new belt in the output - Nate said, hoping that Blair and Serena has not had the visa. Too late. - Nate? - He heard Serena's voice behind him. - Hey, Natie! He turned slowly. The sweet scent of sandalwood and lily was filling his nostrils as she threw his arms in it. She kissed the freed and Jenny in the face. - Hey, which bought? Jenny corou again. - Hmmmm, nothing else. Blair was standing a little away from them, in criticizing the silence of black ugly sparse Jenny and her fuzzy red hat. Nate smiled at her. - Yo, Blair. Blair suspended the Prada bag on the shoulders and shook the hair of the face. - Hi - she said to nobody in particular. She looked briefly for Jenny. - Hi, Ginny. Merry Christmas. Jenny holding a small bag of Barneys behind the back, as if afraid that Blair could get her to see what was inside. - Merry Christmas, she replied frankly disappointed with the voice. Blair was so angry to see them shopping for Christmas together as a couple chatinho and happy that could not withstand a kidding. - Maybe you can help us - it suddenly seemed cheerful. - We are buying gifts for Flow and Miles ... You know who they are, the guys who stayed with us the other night. But do not know what to take. - She cutucou the elbow of Serena. - Serena was thinking of a perfume. Nate, mind if we test you? Nate did not use perfume and really wanted to give out quickly from there, but had no intellectual capacity to get rid the situation. - Of course - he replied without enthusiasm. Blair led them to a stop, and before he could protest, he took the right hand of Nate and spraying a colony Dolce &amp; Gabana she knew that the ass smelled musty and blue cheese. - What do you think? - She asked, placing the hand of Nate under the nose of Jenny. Jenny started to sneeze. - Health - said Serena. Jenny espirrava without stopping. I could not bear it. Nate estremeceu. - It means strong. - Really? And this here, then? - Blair got his left hand and spraying Eau d'Orange Verte from Hermes. It was a classic aroma and pure that she loved and sometimes she wore, although males. Nate smell the hand and was immediately taken by nostalgia, thinking when he was lying in bed for Blair, kissing his bare belly and making it laugh. - Legal, he said, with other fungi. The nose was dripping from Jenny. She dried in the glove. Serena took the left hand of Nate and placed under the very nose. - Oh, is so totally you, Nate - she smiled with sincerity for Jenny. - You should buy one for him for Christmas. It is sensational. Jenny cleared the nose again. I had more money and, moreover, had already bought a gift much better for Nate. She looked at him, hoping that he said the same thing and then they could go, but Nate was only standing there, looking at Blair, with his hands stretched like a doll. The question is again in the heart of esgueirou Jenny. How Nate could be so beautiful when he was alone with her, but when he was with other people was so ... Stupid? Blair wrinkle your nose. - I know not - she muttered. - I think perhaps agent must give something more personal. - Like what? - Serena asked, entering the game. - I just buy one for Nate samba-song with the legal stamp of a sailboat - Jenny suggested full of hope. - They have other different. You should go see. Nate smiled timidly. - Yeah. It is very nice. Blair grabbed the bottle of green Hermes sample of the colony, ready to toss it on the head of Jenny. Samba-song? That bitch. Serena saw that brincadeirinha Blair seemed to be coming back to it. - Come on, Blair - she cutucou slightly from the elbow Blair. Come-up. It has a bikini that I want to try. You can tell me what you think.
