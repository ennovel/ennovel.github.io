He thought it seemed an angel in black and white. An angel with the best pair of big tits he turns. He passed by the hands and arms clear soft as baby of Jenny. She was gentle and warm, fresh bread rolls and a five-star restaurant. The DJ began to play the success of 45, Korrupt Me, and then appeared arrogant Flow ramp coming from nothing, using a coat of smoking on a red shirt with BE KIND in large white characters and laughing as perhaps one of the guys I know most of the world. Flow was the son of a Danish model in lingerie and a Jamaican coffee magnate, and a version appeared tan and blue eyes of Jim Morrison, the classic band of the 1960s, The Doors. He went up behind a glass podium, the music stopped and all uivaram and applauded. Jenny started to hand the thumb of Nate and gave a squeeze as they went out of the corner to see.
<br> - I just wanted to welcome you all for coming here and it is taking place this evening to raise money for ... - Flow opened the jacket of a tuxedo shirt and pointing to some of the guests excited and daring of the dance, a people who had not ashamed to pay Economic, shouted: "Be Kind!" In the same time, Blair opened the door of the bathroom for women to find Nate and Jenny hand in hand and in her path. Jenny wore a dress of garish fashion dubious granny style that was too large and too small bottom up. She and Nate appeared in some suburban bregas night of their prom. Blair Fix the straps of the dress and estalou lips laqueados ruby-red. The sooner left there, the better. But she could not slip away as a poor ex-girlfriend rejected. I had to show more pride than that of shit. Well, much more. - I would like to thank the organizing committee of the ball, led by Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen - Flow continued, reading a cart?ozinho who was in his hand. - Hey, that the two girls do not come here and help me to announce how much money raised? All esticaram the neck to look for Serena and Blair. In his typically exuberant way, Serena dropped a high yelp and slide effortlessly by the dance floor, climbing the podium with the hair clear esvoa?antes. Flow took a step back, muted by the beauty of it, and Serena is bent into the microphone. - Come on, Blair - she shouted, looking at crowded hall. - Come here! Blair could feel that people saw. She tried to give a smile and left his post at the door of the bathroom, walking in front of the nose and Nate] enny while opening the way to the front hall. The mouth of Nate Blair zuniu when it opened for him. It seemed higher than he remembered and his butt was more defined. The long hair and skin glowed had a pearly tone that it was willing to play her. She was hot. No, she was more than hot. Suddenly he was confused. I take the arm of Blair and say: "Come back here. I made a mistake." But then] enny shook his hand, and he looked at the brown eyes and moving neckline and deep, and immediately forgot to Blair again. Nate was like the more goofy labrador. If you balance a stick in front of him, he only thought about get it, but if you throw a tennis ball, he forgot the rod and ran behind the ball.
<br> Blair joined them on the podium and Flow gave Serena a sheet of paper, smiling from ear to ear as the two organizers of the ball, by chance, were so beautiful. - OK - Serena said, reading the paper. - So, we raise eight hundred thousand and four hundred dollars. All the benefit of Be Kind, a new international fund to rescue animals. - She exhibited the famous smile that had been captured by so many photographers in the pages of social and foforas and the arm of cutucou Blair. Blair had organized hundreds of such things. She knew the protocol. She bent to the microphone .. - Thanks for coming! - She cried, giving the best smile of benefactress. - And do not forget to exchange their gifts Coach ... is the best part of the party! The music started again, higher than before, and all turned to drink and dance. Flow bent his head to Serena and whispered something in her ear. The breath of it was hot and pinicou in her ear. He had smell of new leather. Serena laughed. -Wait a minute, okay? Flow assentiu while Serena took the arm of Blair and is out of padi, dragging her friend back to the table for two. - He wants me to find him out there, give us a ride in his limo. Quick, grab your coat. You will also. Blair made a grimace. She really was not the type to hold candle, thank you. - I think not. Serena pretended not to hear. Blair would not let melasse all his party. Kati, Isabel, Chuck, and Aaron Miles were still seated at the table, drinking the Stoli that Chuck had brought in a bottle of silver monogram. - Come on - Serena said to them in jubilation. - Everybody out! Let's do the party in the limo Flow! Blair's got the ticket in his jacket pocket baguette Fendi fur of mink and armadillo not exactly free of cruelty. Sometimes the enthusiasm of the Serena beirava irritating. But Blair could not say that I do not like to dance. She liked the idea of being produced walking across the city by car, seeing the world through the glass fumê the limo. Audrey Jennifer was so in luxury. And maybe a walk in the mud flow was exactly what his life would become, like magic, a series of disasters for a series of dreams that become reality. Nate was getting half full of both kissing Jenny. He had drunk too much and needed to give even a few tapas. - Want to walk a little? - He asked. Jennysorriu for him. It seemed that the cilia of Nate had been bathed in gold and the hair. The only thing that would leave that evening even more perfect Nate would tell her: "I love you." And she hoped that was exactly what he would do. - Of course - she said anxiously. They got the jackets and Nate kept the door open for when she left the bustle of the hotel. A huge black limousine with darkened windows was parked outside. Nate and Jenny down the marble steps to the sidewalk and Nate tore her hand to turn a slightly based. Jenny jumble of his black suede gloves, disappointed. If Nate was going to say "I love you," she did not want was stoned when he did that. Suddenly the glass of the black limo down and appeared the beautiful blond hair from Serena.
