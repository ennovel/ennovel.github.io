He had yellow hair. No yellow of blond, but yellow mucus as a serious patient. The eyes of both were found and Mr. Beckham did something strange: it was red. Excusez-moi? Blair distracted eyes, scared. Balan?aram his feet nervously as she looked the question. Vous avez une desire. What desirez vous? She wanted very professorzinho film that she hated the thought of not the impression that it was in order. I wanted to be on the beach right now, instead of freezing your butt in a classroom barely heated. I have taken the breakfast because it was dead from hunger. I'd like a lot of things, but could only answer one. Blair said he wanted to go to Yale, but seemed totally redundant for a trainee secondary say that I go to a university, but it was better than reveal some juicy personal details to Madame Rogers, anyway. So she designed a high-heeled botinha margin in terms of evidence and looked for Mr. Beckham again. He was still looking for her, his face a shade of thick reddish-purple. What he was doing? Up to the murder of her or wonder how Blair would be of panties? She turned eyes, disgusted. He looked at the clock Cartier platinum. Another hell of an hour ahead. Next question. Two floors below Blair, in the auditorium of the Constance Billard School, Serena was ralando with proof of American history. No. Serena was not exactly the type that ralava. She had already counted the number of tips on his tail-of-horse - nine - and had answered the question about the English involvement in the Second World War with a very short essay about how during the war there were shortages of everything and the British had to open hand of nylon socks because there was not available. Instead, these courageous women, aware of the fashion industry and painting lines on the back of the leg to give the impression that they were wearing stockings. Serena sighed. Then a girl probably spent a night with a guy and not have your picture filling all the gossip pages of the next day. Photos of Serena and Flow in Gorgona appeared on the Post, in Entertainment Weekly, the People, the Women's Wear Daily and on countless Web pages, all calling both "the new couple 'it'''. That was ridiculous. She gave a kiss-off in Flow amanhecia on the sidewalk when the bar of the Tribeca Star Hotel on Sunday, and he went out to catch a private plane to Baja, where they would redo some of the scenes clip for the new music from 45, Life of Krim, before leaving for Christmas. He was incredibly sweet and the two had a great night, but they definitely were not a couple. A couple meant that the two see every day. Meant that they were in love. And while she and Flow could have been half in lust, they definitely were not lovers, despite the fact he has sent flowers to her. Three dozen black tulips difficult-to-find, to be exact. Serena was accustomed to winning in these guys, so the flowers do not have, since Flow not begin to send him things every day. Sometimes a guy could exaggerate a little. Consider Dan Humphrey, for example. He followed Serena as a puppy when she returned to school in the fall, and even wrote poems that were so serious and sick of love that came to scare. Serena like that of Dan, but he was way too intense. Lucky for her, he fell in love with Vanessa, who was also intense, and they formed a great couple. But Serena was not interested in combining with anyone. She emphasized the independence, their ability to follow the whims and do what it liked. She made a clean impulsive - form a casalzinho only restrict his style. Serena started the next question: When the U.S. armed forces entered the Second World War and why? A more pertinent question would be: Where is she would use this knowledge? The answer was totally obvious: never! Who to call what happened in the past when the future was in front of you, with surprises and sensational loucuras inenarráveis hiding behind every curve? Someone gave her a pat on the shoulder and looked at Serena. Mr. Hanson was the teacher of Latin and inspector of the evidence of history. He was tall, thin and had a mustache who was always exactly the same size so that all the girls of Constance were convinced that it was false. - What? - Serena said, functioning. She knew that was divagando, but could not be in trouble for it is written evidence could? - I did something wrong? Then she realized that Mr. Hanson had a smile beneath the mustache. He put a copy of the Post in her hands. I turned on page six, the gossip page of the celebrities, where there was a huge picture of Serena and Flow entering a taxi after leaving Gorgona on Saturday night. - Sorry to interrupt, but I realized that you were finishing the race and I was wondering if it would be possible to ask for autograph Flow this - he whispered. - I am a big fan of him. It would be great if you autograph. Serena blinked. First, she did not even know that Mr. Hanson was cool enough to know who was Flow. Second, she did not intend to ask nothing to Flow. And third - If ligaaaa! She was nowhere near finishing the race! - The Flow is in Baja - she whispered back. - OK if I only autograph? - She gave a look at the room, embarrassed. Most of the other girls had stopped writing and was looking for her and for Mr. Hanson or talking. - I knew that Serena and Flow are engaged - Nicki Burton said the friend Alicia Edwards. - They will be married on the eve of New Year-in Vegas. In the Bellagio. - The Post said they met in the Black-and-White on Saturday - Isabel Coates said the Kati Farkas. - But it is not quite true. - They met in the recovery last year, right? - Kati said. - Flow was recovering, so kind, a dozen times. But it also. Serena signed his name and returned the paper to Mr. Hanson, hoping that he would not give him a bad note in Latin, now that she does not pegara autograph of the Flow. - Thanks - he whispered, looking to sign it. He smiled all excited. - I am sure it will worth a fortune one day! - Sure - Serena said, being lenient with him. The buzz in the room was getting louder. - Very good, girls. Back to work - roughly shouted Mr. Hanson returned to his desk while in front of the room. Serena looked at the evidence again. When the American forces entered the Second World War and why? But before he could begin to respond, came a swarm of dozens of members of the class, all holding copies of the Post for her autograph. Mr. Hanson could not tell them to stop when he was himself who started everything. - Very well - he said, ignoring the pleading eyes of Serena. - I will give the five minutes all the more in our evidence. Five minutes, then I want to return to their portfolios. - First I! - Rain Hoffstetter shouted, extending his copy of the Post for Serena. - No, me! - It was the turn of Laura Salmon shouting, pushing Rain to the side. Serena laughed to herself in amazement. When he returned to school two months before, was considered a leper. And now everyone wanted his autograph. She hesitated, the pen placed on top of the photo copy of Laura. Then she wrote in her typical letter full of turns: For you who love me, Serena. sex, love and Frankenstein Proof of English learners in the Riverside Prep was notoriously long and difficult, but Dan was not worried. I had read of Frankenstein Mary Shelley twice and save the majority of Keats's poems in his memory anthological. Moreover, sleeping until he could write a test of English for a decent A. After building a Rouxinol''Ode''as completely as could, he turned the blue book of evidence and started writing a new poem that was espetava that turn into something that could send the proposal to the university. Dan in general never wrote anything that was not full of poems of love angútia. This is called''For Vanessa 'Paper Cuts Lemons thrown Salt water in my eyes He was experiencing a new form of free verse and was not sure were some great lines. His face A voice You softens my edges And my engine lubricates Lubricates my engine? No, that seemed too much sex and he did not want to give Vanessa no idea where to generally show the poem to her. What he meant was that she inspired. Dan looked at the words and tried to think of a better way to say it. Then he pulled the sheet of paper from a notebook and amassou ball. Why could not write anything good? Dan felt that the observed someone and looked to the left, where Chuck Bass, one of the biggest assholes of his class, was sitting. In the fifth series, Chuck was one of the lowest in the boys class. Wore glasses with rims of horn and brown suits of velvet and it had seemed to go to the bathroom all the time. He and Dan have done together in fifth grade English teacher and the two asked in class, to write a poem about a part of the body. Chuck had a dreadful creative writing and passed a note to Dan Dan begging to write a poem for him. Writing was easy for Dan, he said the first thing that came to mind, a poem on his hands and all that they did it for a day. He gave the poem to Chuck, so he copy, and then prepared another poem about his own mouth that had n?ao nor the quality of the first half. Chuck took the poem A + with the hands and received a note from the teacher saying, See Q ue can do when focused? While Dan achieved a B in the poem of the mouth and a note that said the teacher, I know you can do better. In the beginning, Dan does not matter. At least he had helped a boy who seemed really need help. But a year later Chuck was 45 centimeters high, began to shave and use the ring pink monogram and navy blue scarf, and has become a real jerk, especially when it came to girls. He was trying to hurt the sister of Dan, Jenny, in a bathroom at a party booked in the month passado.Dan left very clear that Chuck mortally hated, but this did not matter. From time to time he also asked to Dan to help you in English, and Dan would say it a''fuck you''again. Now that Chuck was looking for the blue book of Dan, trying to read the test on his''Ode to a Rouxinou'', Dan became a blank page and said, can read this, asshole? Fuck you! in huge black letters. Chuck espiou the blue book of Dan and then looked at cimea and showed the middle finger to Dan NO, fuck YOU!, Said Dan and underlined twice. Before moving to the next question, Dan releu some of verss''Ode to a Rouxinol''in its evidence. Secretly listen, and for a long time I was fascinated by the way light of Death. It was the perfect beginning of a poem to Vanessa. It was his secret. And that was true, Dan was half in love with death, the way they made a chimney smoked, rarely ate and drank buckets of coffee. Vanessa is the left. She kept the alive. Dan picked up the pen again and tried to think of a more poetic sucista to write the same thing as Keats had written, but different. But even if working a lot, he could not think of another way of saying the same cosia that was at least nice. Instead, he read the next issue of proof. We discussed in class the various meanings of the symbolic creature similar to humans Frankster of Mary Shelley. But what Frankster mean to you? Dan looked at the plate Output in bright red on the door of the gym, thinking. He always felt very scary Frankster, ms also very beautiful in some way. Frankenstein did not want to hurt anyone, but could not avoid - was a monster. In a way, was as the love and wonderful horrible, terrifying and liberating, creepy and sad, all at the same time. Tremendous creative energy, Dan pa'gina turned the blank on the back of a sheet of blue book and wrote to Vanessa again on top of the page. Then wrote the first verse: You're my Frankenstein. Oh, well. Want to know how was the second verse? Vanessa was sitting in the back of the auditorium of Constance Billard School doing the same proof of history of Serena.

Oh, well. Want to know how was the second verse? Vanessa was sitting in the back of the auditorium of Constance Billard School doing the same proof of history of Serena. He had finished the race 45 minutes earlier and now. while plugged Members of the class were still around Serena workers as bees around the queen just because Serena had been photographed with that tasteless and illiterate musical singer of a band of the weekend, Vanessa was tracing the route of a movie about the city that she hoped to deliver University of New York as part of its proposal. Fuck the Page Six. Would document the real life that rolava in the city, the really interesting things that happen right under the nose of people while they are occupied by reading the Page Six.Primeiro, she wanted to wake before dawn and shot the fishermen coming to the port to deliver the fish the FIDH Fulton Market. The smell of fish on sick leave, but one thing was perfect: it could follow the journey of a fish from the boat to the market, which would be sold by type so, 65 cents per kilo, and some of the uptown restaurant where he would be served encrusted of pistachio with red potatoes and wild mushroom butter from the dish for $ 29. An anorexic twice divorced from Park Avenue to ask, would give only a few nibble and then the rest of the dish would be thrown away.
