<br> 
<br> Christmas in New York is truly magical, especially in the uptown. The air smells like snow falling, the wood burning and assando cakes. From our roof, the Central Park looks like an enchanted kingdom of silver, the ParkAvenue is a parade of lights, Christmas tree and the size of Rockefeller Center seems to promise that this Christmas will be the most wonderful of all - though most of us will be drinking champagne to understand others. Along the Fifth Avenue, all the shop windows of department stores are decorated for the holidays and all the girls who go out for shopping use of Cashmere coats beautiful azure Marc Jacobs who bought in October and barely saw the time of use. And the night leaving all to enjoy, enjoy, enjoy. Nothing to study for exams in mid-year and nothing of those last-minute attempts to get to college and nothing to help mom to buy gifts for the employed, the cooks, drivers and girls of the laundry. Get your black satin dress drapeado of Prada, the shoes of needle jump of pure acrylic Christian Louboutin, the Hermes Birkin bag orange, the more expensive lindinho that know and follow me! FlagraD and V lips glued to the pier in the 79th It is tragic half the time it took to realize that they are loved. N J to buying red roses - and do not think he has a soft heart that beautiful body Chapad?o. B and S to Bendel's going to get dressed for the prom night of Black-and-White. Knew Flow - former model and now beautiful singer and guitarist, whose band, the 45, just won the MTV Music Award for best album for his disc of debut, Komunik8 - will do the honor to announce how much money raised. The ball is in favor of Be Kind, a group that argues for the rights of animals, of which Flow is the spokesman. But who calls it? We all know that only come on to take a look at his perfect face. See you there! Do they really are friends now? That's right: If B decided to resume the friendship, and was not about time. I mean, how long you can stay angry with someone who took bath in primary school? B may not be as lean or too blond or too "experienced" as S, but that does not mean that you must hate it. ES never be so dishonest or so ensimesmada as B, but that does not mean that you have to be afraid of it. So the two decided to leave the differences aside and be nice to each other, at least for now. The question is, now they come back, what kind of crazy crap they will finish? They may believe, be the first to discover and you will know soon after. I'm not exactly good at keeping secrets.
<br> For you who love me, gossip girl the dance the dance - If it were, like so, some fifteen centimeters higher, he could support the chin in her lap - Blair Waldorf as noted by the ex-boyfriend, Nate Archibald, dancing with Jenny Humphrey, a student of eighth grade and short peitudona that Nate was the reason for inexplicably jilt Blair a few weeks before. - But then he would have trouble breathing. Fortunately, Blair had waived the dinner that night, otherwise it would have gone straight to the bathroom to vomit of women sick. Serena van der Woodsen, the oldest and newest friend of Blair, said the hair swinging clear.
<br> - I understand - she said. - I have nothing against Jenny, but always thought you and Nate were so kind, the perfect couple. You were fully intended to spend the rest of their lives together. Serena said it was strange to hear that. After all, she and Nate had lost their virginity together, without the knowledge of Blair, when they finished the eighth grade. If two people were destined to one another, but they could be. But, as in any relationship where Serena has been involved, with its farrinha Nate was just a quick fied. Blair and Nate were serious thing. And they were always a presence, as reliable as the doorman in the lobby of the building at Fifth Avenue Serena - which was impossible to imagine how the future would be without them as spouses. Because of them, Serena would be felt as part of a relationshipseriously, and it was daunting to see how things had been bad. Blair sofregamente drank of his cup of Cristal champagne. The two girls were sitting alone at a round table and large, covered with a towel taffeta black and white muslin, the opulent ballroom of the Hotel St. Claire, ballroom where the annual Black-and-White was good bunch. Girls take the fall-to-long and black of Versace and Dolce &amp; Gabbana, with white plumes in the hair, danced with boys in scintillant smokings black and white Tom Ford for Gucci, and a giant ball made of black and white roses hung from ceiling. Blair had a strong déjà vu. Her mother had married a month before with a Mané, suarento named Cyrus Rose, fat and receipt of the marriage happened in that room. The marriage also occurred on the anniversary of 17 years of Blair, the day she planned to go to the end with Nate. She spent hours if store and tested repeatedly in the head every moment of it. But then she was hampered by Nate is holding with that little girl in the lobby of the hotel and realized that in the end, no matter how nice you were on your bridesmaid dress from Chloé brown, or how her hair was theater, or the height of jumps of her Manolo Blahnik stiletto, Natewas busy apalpando the breasts of that balloon head felpuda of 14 years to realize something.
