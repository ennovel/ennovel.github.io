Blair cutucou Serena with the same force. She took a folded white cart?ozinho, placed on the table, and handed to Serena. Serena of the fingers were trembling as she read the typology golden printed on card: Please make your reservations for the Isle of Ia Paix Christmas Party featuring the 45 Eight-midnight Serena took Blair's hand and shook. The only thing that would keep the two sound of Christmas was becoming drunk together. - Oh, look! - Ping Eleanor, causing Serena and Blair jumping on the chair. She pointed to the reception desk of the restaurant. - St. Bartholomew Bass and Misty! She lowered the voice to a whisper. - I heard that Misty removed the liver ... she has a terrible problem with the drink ... but I think she is right. I wonder if they came here by boat. What a clever way to stay dry. I mean, you can not drink a lot in a boat is not taking any alcoholic beverage. Misty and Bartholomew Bass, the parents of the infamous Chuck Bass, were giving entry to the hotel, a pile of Louis Vuitton bags at the feet of them. Blair and Chuck Serena waited that appear behind the parents - it would be very lucky - but there was no sign of him. - It was her appendix, mother - said Blair after a minute. It seemed that Chuck had stayed at home, thank God. - She had appendicitis. It was no big deal. - Well, it was not what I knew - Eleanor insisted. -Anyway, I do not know if they will spend the Christmas here. She looked around the restaurant, afagando the coral and diamond brooch with your fingertips. - I heard that some celebrities usually stay here too, although it has not seen any that I recognize.
<br> Cyrus has been set to placing a potato chip in the mouth of Eleanor. - Just to make sure you're consuming all the vitamins and minerals, honey - he said lovingly. Blair was sure that the mother did not need more of potato chips and had also not sure that I would sit there watching the food Cyrus mother. That gave him an even greater desire to vomit. - Excuse me - and muttered Blair fired the table in search of the women's restroom closer. All were so accustomed to the sudden exit of Blair that no one has the slightest to that, but think of Serena hated Blair forcing the vomit in the bathroom. She left the cloth napkin from the hamburger untouched. - Thanks for lunch - she said with a weak voice. Then got up and ran behind Blair to see if she was well, keeping the adorable blond hair down in the case of Flow be there around, spying behind a palm. who really wants to know the victoria's secret? - Wait just to see what I just bought - Vanessa told Dan while he sat in the dining room table of his father. Jenny Nate had not yet arrived, but Rufus had drunk too much red wine and was eager to eat. - It is completely crazy. Vai be very proud of me. - You 'filmmaker, Vanessamonda? - Asked Lyle, The friend's father, Dan, serving up a little lasagna. - What kind of films you do? Vanessa drank a sip of water. - In black and white. You know, without much action. Lyle filled the rest of the plate with baked beans, monitoring that Rufus had chosen to serve with the lasagna. - Movies of art, huh? Vanessa seats. - I guess. - I am more to the films of adventure. Have you seen The Mumia? For me, it is a perfect movie. But Vanessa was not listening. Nate and Jenny had just arrived and were making the jacket in the vestibule. - Sorry, Dad - Jenny was out of breath, taking his hat. Vanessa immediately recognized the hat. It was red and fuzzy, like the girl in the park. And Nate was wearing a long navy blue jacket, like the guy in the park. He also had the same way to mauricinho and the same golden-brown hair. Vanessa down the fork. Epa. - Dad, and that Nate - Jenny said, taking Nate to the table. She seemed to be dancing around the table, kissing everyone there. Knew it was not possible to be so happy. Nate said that he loved! Nate shook the hand of her father. - Nice to know him, Mr. Humphrey. Rufus was full of mouth and used the wine to help swallow. - Nate, my boy, you are the reason for my daughter to have caught more than four hundred U.S. dollars loaned me last month is finally nice to meet you - Rufus departed from the table next to his chair. - Come, sit down. Jenny was so alvoro?ada not matter if the father of her embarrassed you. She just hoped it was nice to Nate. - Well, tell me, Nate - became Rufus, serving the wine cup in a gallon of Nate. - What is your? Nate smiled. Jennifer's father seemed nice. - Boats - he replied. - My parents have a house in Mount Desert, in Maine. Me and my dad do it and sailing boats. Dan Rufus hoped to begin devouring Nate alive, esbravejando about the selfishness of the class of idle and useless things like sailing, but Rufus seemed to be fascinated and continued asking questions to Nate. Normally, such a hypocrisy ceased Dan crazy, but he also was distrafdo other with what it meant to Vanessa to bother with his father talking to a fucking stoned spoiled as Nate. He took his lasagna. Ten more minutes and would ask permission for him and Vanessa could "talk" in your room. Suddenly, Rufus hit the table. - One time, I spend all the dishes. I think this would have a lasagne taste much better if flambada. - Parent - Jenny gemeu. He would shame it completely. It was inevitable. Nate went to the plate Rufus, who lit a match and dropped in for Nate lasagne. Both had the rum sauce that lasagne caught fire. - Yeah! - Nate exclaimed. Rufus and Jenny laughed happily passed the plate for him, a broad smile on the face of excitement arrested. It seemed that they were engaged! Dan could not endure more. Turned up and bent his head to Vanessa. - Can I talk to you a minute? - He was very nervous, hands train. - Okay - Vanessa retorted, suddenly nervous também.Será who dare to go ahead with it and show it to the new costumes? Lyle took the plate and he turned it on fire. - Thank you - she muttered distracted. Dan stood up. - Come on. Vanessa picked up the bag and followed by the long corridor to the quarto.O department of Humphreys was one of those relics that were not leased retired since the 1940s. It was large and dirty, with the wooden floor cracked and paint peeling on the walls, and smelled like old shoes and binding mofada. Dan once found a deck which was printed in 1955, still sealed, on a shelf of the office of her father. All kings seemed Elvis Presley. They were amazing. - And then? - Dan began bluntly while closing the door of the room. - I wanted to tell you something. Vanessa sat on the ground and untied shoelaces of the boot of the fight. If you would continue with what it had to make quick, before we stop and consider the matter. - Arr? - she took the half of it and put the boots. Two nights ago, she left her sister, Ruby, paint the nails of the feet of her chocolate-brown. Were still very good. She stood up and undo the cardiga black. Dan was up to the table and got the last block black, thinking that perhaps, if the show Vanessa as his poetry was bad, she understand why he had to sex. He browse the pages. They were full of beginnings of poems such as: you are my Frankenstein, my Liechtenstein, my God.
