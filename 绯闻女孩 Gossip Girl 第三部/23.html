Read them left the red with shame. - I can not write anything else of good - he said, still browsing the block. Vanessa has a black wool skirt and pulled the shirt collar of rulê black head scraped by. Then he raised his hands with the hips, hoping that if Dan became. - I went thinking, perhaps the reason that I can not write anything is because ... - Dan closed the block and turned. - I need ... - He stopped suddenly. Vanessa was standing near his bed, using a half-cup bra-income black and short-income black thin and transparent so that Dan could see everything through them. Of course. And for that they serve. She laughed and hit the eyelashes. - What do you think? Dan looked at her, terrified. It was the last thing I expected to see. - What are you doing? Vanessa approached him, trying not to think about what were their thighs and the lower back that supercurta thong. She became the hands on the shoulders of Dan All his body shake. She did not know if that was good or bad. Dan gave a look in the room. - There is filming this, this? - He asked, suspicious. In general Vanessa asked him first if he wanted to be one of her films, but he had already seen Vanessa trying to shoot something quite rough without saying anything to it first. She shook her head. - Kiss Me - she said. Dan crossed his arms. He knew what was arming Vanessa. So? They were in love. Why does not he simply attacked? Any other guy atacaria.Mas Dan definitely was not any one guy. He was Dan, the romantic sensitive. He does not want to be the first time by a atravancada-income black lingerie. It was premeditated and other cliche too e. .. wrong. He wanted it to be pure, espontaneo e. .. perfect. Dan took a step back and turned his head to the side. - Sorry - he said. Vanessa felt she had pressed and maybe Dan was not being fair, but was just trying to have fun a little. It was trying to do is irresistible to him, but he obviously was able to resist well. She took the exit at the bed and quickly put on his head, feeling completely humiliated. Dan lit cigarette urn and took urn long shot. - You show me what you filmed in the park? - He asked. Hmmm. Maybe not. Vanessa shook her head, unable to look at it. Pulled the skirt and the button Cardigan. Dan put the cigarette into an empty coffee cup. - I think we should return the table, then. Vanessa the boot and tied it up. - Although I think I will - she said, voice shaking. Not cried since that was about four years, but it seemed that was about to cry now. Dan based, is divided between feeling to ask her what was the problem and want to leave it so that he could try to write again. What they say to each other if it was, alias? And strange as a relationship can change completely after you see his girlfriend using a small lingerie. Vanessa went to the door and opened it. - Bye - she said little. - Bye - Dan replied as the door closes. He went to the table, sat up and opened the block, hoping that his confusion about what had just happened the inspiration to write something brilliant. But not happened, and then he was sitting there, smoking like a chimney. the art of leaving j n scared - Can you give me leave, Dad? - Jenny asked. - I want to show my room to Nate. Rufus looked bad for her. - Mais oui - he said in French urn terrfvel.-Bien s?r. Jenny goggle. When the father drank much red wine, he tried to take the personality of a beat poet cool, smoking cigarettes and talking in a French coffee boemio. Like father like son. - Come on - she said to Nate, leading him by corridor to the room. She opened the door and lit the lamp. Nate did not expect to be surprised in the fourth Jenny. the rest of the apartment was confortave1 middle and falling to pieces, like a country house that was never cleaned, and he hoped that the room it was more so. But Jenny hated the smooth walls of a grimy white, the ceiling cracked, the surface of bare wood and the old white sheets, and it was a good artist. So, in recent months, she began painting, particularly portraits, and his favorite subject, of course, Nate was. There were six of them in total, each made in the style of a different artist. There was the Nate of Monet, the impressionist style, and Nate of Picasso, with eyes on the feet, and Nate of Dalí, dripping a puddle on the sidewalk, and Nate of Warhol, with electric green eyes and hair in, gold, Nate of Pollock, with the ink respingada in the form of a head, and Nate of Changall, with the head of Nate flying at night sky. - You like? - Jenny asked full of hope. _ I'm trying to copy all the different styles. The Pollock is one of the most difficult. Nate looked gaping the paintings on the wall. Pollock did not know what was, not recognized any of the styles of other artists who use Jenny, but he recognized six times and that was enough to make it stop. -So it is that I spent most of the time-Jenny explained cheerfully. Nate was so lovely talking to her father that she was even more in love with him. Courageously, she stood tiptoe and put their hands on his shoulders. -I kind of wanted to kiss you all night - sussurou it with the voice rouxa; Nate was hard, but not the way you think. Yes normally such moves would make a beautiful erection, but Nate had just had a very clear framework for moving Jenny hours alone in a room painting those retartos good, but extremely strange, him. The case was that he had said to Jenny that I loved her. And that means he was sincere all the time. But is she now hoped that he, like, so deflorasse or something? He kissed a light in the mouth. -I better go. I have to make the bags for tomorrow, those things. Jenny wrinkle the forehead. -Oh, please do not go - she laughed and looked at the floor. - I'm still as dental floss. Nate had to leave before it started to get the clothes in front of her collection of art. Fortunately not had to invent a good excuse to go immediately, because his cell phone rang. He took the pocket of the Colca and looked the number it flashes on the screen. It was Jeremy. So-man, where are you? -We are about to find that the bar of the Rivington. You know, the one where Charlie was expelled by a light pipe of stuff in the output of a fire. -All right, calm - insistruiu Nate, thinking that if we do that the call seemed urgent, Jenny would let him leave. -Huh? - Jeremy said. I-I 'il - Nate hung up and took the hand of Jenny. -Sorry, Jennifer, ams I really gotta go. Jeremy said that Charlie and Antony took an E and are freaking. I have to go help the guys before they cause any serious prezuíso. Jenny based, the lower lip trembling. Nate was going to Maine tomorrow. She would not see him for days and days. -All right. He pulled into a hug. I'm going back-to-New Year. Stay straight, okay? She closed his eyes hard and hugged tight. - I love you - I could not get tired of saying it. Nate moved away and got a panda pelucia of the bed of Jenny. He placed in her arms. - Pretend that I am - he said, kissing her on the nose. After he left the room and passed the hall, waving a polite thank you to Mr. Humphrey before jumping into taxi urn straight to the bar on Rivington Street, where they would pay a fine to drink friend Jeremy in gratitude for saving the skin without knowing it.
