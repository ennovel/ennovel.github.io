However, Dan was not a normal boy. Instead of thinking about taking the clothes of Vanessa, he thought in words old, unless they were used in a sensual. And to do that you have to stop thinking about words and start thinking about something or, even better, someone. Preferably someone without clothes. But Dan was arrested for words. The more agonizava on what words to use, was more convinced that it could not write about sex because they had not yet done. And if he did not write about sex, would not get to write about love. And if you can not write about love, write more n?a would achieve nothing. Is that sex was the cure for writer's block? v discovers the Victoria 's Secret On Thursday after school, Vanessa walked by Broadway, in Soho, filming a transvestite dressed in a overalls PVC boots and black PVC platform to jump 15, walking with a tiny chihuahua usually cooped up in a black orange fuzzy when he was stopped in front of Victoria's Secret by a woman who distributes promotional leaflets .

Vanessa started to handle the camera on the shoulder and opened the heavy glass door of the store, thinking it could be fun way out. She was addressed as soon as the door is closed behind you. - Welcome to Victoria's Secret - said a blonde mignon with a black terninho tight. - Can I help her to find something today? Vanessa looked at her. I hated that hover sellers around the people. - No - she replied, with his wife. - Only I'm giving a look. The woman smiled graciously. - Fine. Just so you know, my name is Vanessa. Vanessa looked at her, surprised. - It is my name too - she said, feeling means bad for being so rough with the woman. - We have the same name. The radiant Vanessa Louro smiled at her. - But what a coincidence! Well you do not forget my name. Call me if you need anything - then it turned to help another client. Vanessa looked at the store. Perfume and chamber music filled the air, and the carpet was a deep red velvet. Round tables were covered with red satin d batteries varias and panties in solid colors, animals and padronagens Floral. In each wall had shelves of suti?s of income, stretch satin and cotton. There was corpetes, tango, and v-strings shortinhos. Petticoat, bustiês, alloys and friction-alloys. Vanessa had never seen so much space devoted to the type the vanity of woman she always loathe. But maybe, just maybe, a set of middle-income bra cup Very Sexy and a thong-income were the kind of thing that she needed to be so irresistible to Dan, he would have his moment organic poetic or what were you were expecting and decided it was ready for sex.
