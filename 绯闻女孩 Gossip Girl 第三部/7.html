But tell your father that I will not eat like a pig as did last year. It is another thing that I am giving a time. I lost three kilos. Dan continued afagando the back of Vanessa. -Why? - He asked. Vanessa did not need to diet. The body of it was exactly as she described in one of his poems: as water. -Because my clothes are better if I do fall. - Vanessa was not interested in being magrela, as the majority of colleagues in class, but not like when it had to shrink the belly button to your pants. -Well, I like you as you are - Dan said, and the nose in her ear. Vanessa turned her head to him and his lips met in a long, sweet kiss. While kissing, she could not stop thinking about sex with Dan could be much more significant than had been with Clark. At least Dan was ready. -I love you - she whispered, closing the it. Vanessa thought for some time to ask again if he wanted to try sex, but would not estegar the moment. Only had to wait until he was ready, but with Dan it could mean waiting until they were married or something. So it seems they no longer acted as if they were not married. Excuse me, I will yawn. J regret to participate if the party In the backseat of the limo Flow, Blair felt squeezed by peituda of Jenny Humphrey desengo?ado and the friend of Aaron, Miles, the drummer spindly. On the other side of them was in the lap of Serena Flow - "To make room for others," she said - and Nate press in the window, getting stoned. He also was based for the past Kati, Elizabeth and Chuck, which was even more irritating than stoned drunk. Aaron was sitting cross-legged on the floor, between the two rear seats, smoking a cigarette of their Natural playing PlayStation 2's limo. - What is your real name indeed? - Serena asked the Flow, but already knew, for a program of MTV, that his name was Julian prosper. Indeed it is a name much better than Flow, but would not say it to him. He gave his famous risinho of shy guy caught in the covers Spins, Rolling Stone, Entertainment Weekly and Interview and shook his head. - It is not so important - Well, you is not so beautiful person - she said turning her head to the other side with a wicked smile. She was lying, of course. He was at least ten times more beautiful than the pictures, if that is possible. Serena knew he was flirting in a ridiculous, but she loved how the dark-brown hair is wound in the Flow of temples, the skin a golden bronze and his fingers seemed delicate. Why not get the guy? It was only for one night. Tomorrow Flow would return to Los Angeles, or wherever they lived, and she finally begin to look for evidence. All that she wanted was a little fun. All that Serena wanted was a little fun all the time. Flow back, pretending to be ashamed of their good looks. - Sorry. I think I am not so high as well. He bent forward and opened the Sub-Zero refrigerator bottom of your bank. - Hey, you drink here. Someone there is headquartered? - I please - Blair replied immediately. Getting drunk and was the only way to support something like that. - Hmmm, I try a little - is Jenny ventured timidly. The limo was a shift in a sewage and cover their breasts quicaram without mercy. She looked at Nate on whether he had noticed, but he was looking through the window with one way air when it took was extremely stoned. Miles helped fill the Flow ten Cristal champagne flutes with. He spent one to Blair. - Tintim - he said, hitting the cup on her. Blair took the cup, and was not seated near the window and had nothing to look at, looked at the face of Miles. He had round eyes and brown-gold, half similar to the eyes of Mookie, the dog of Aaron. The insolent nose and a half was dotted snub of blond hair and freckles pequenininhas clear-spike straight up. Ajulgar the way the jump from neck veins long, he probably knitting, playing basketball or something. In all, he seemed a little drawing of a character in a body of athlete. But as Blair had nothing better to do, and it was clear that he was to her, she thought it could be fun way paquerar Miles. She put her hand on his leg. - Thank you. - She took a sip of champagne. Miles smiled as we thought it was the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Flow could not stop drooling for Serena. - You are the most beautiful girl I met recently .- he muttered in her ear. - Maybe forever. I can not believe that it is not model or actress or anything like that. Serena plunged fingers on the glass of champagne and put in the mouth. Considering how he was famous, she thought it would be Flow convinced all soft and full of chat, but he was surprisingly candid. If it were not a rock star so beautiful, it could have been a total lack of style, but he was a rock star's so beautiful, so she decided to leave this detail go. - No - she said. - I'm just me. Indeed, pictures of Serena were constantly appearing in social columns and magazines, she not only paid for them - not needed. Flow continued facing Serena. Serena laughed. - Stop it. - Ahhhh, baby - Chuck said in a nasty, pulling the joint. -Someone is getting someone today, he closed his eyes. It seemed he was about to faint. - I am dying of hunger - grunhiu Kati. She opened the door of the ashtray of the limo and then closed. - Do you have anything to eat? - I think all ... half-unpleasant said Isabel with eyes jumping head. Aaron looked up to find Blair sitting very close to Miles, her hand inn bluntly in his knee. Without ending the game, he turned off the PlayStation 2 and stood up, squeezing between the two in the bank. - Ai - gemeu Blair when his skinny ass carnations in her hips. - Well, come around, then - said Aaron. - Hey, where are we, anyway? - He asked the Flow. Flow increased their long fingers in endless musical hair of the shoulders and gave Serena.
<br> - At the center. Maybe stop at a nightclub. Jenny shook a flute of champagne and contort it in the bank. Was legal for them to go to a nightclub. They seemed older than they were and probably had false identities. Despite breasts, Jenny seemed to have about ten years.
