Mr. Carey was accustomed to say that he was the only man in his parish who worked seven days a week.
<br> 
<br> The household got up half an hour earlier than usual. No lying abed for a poor parson on the day of rest, Mr. Carey remarked as Mary Ann knocked at the door punctually at eight. It took Mrs. Carey longer to dress, and she got down to breakfast at nine, a little breathless, only just before her husband. Mr. Carey’s boots stood in front of the fire to warm. Prayers were longer than usual, and the breakfast more substantial. After breakfast the Vicar cut thin slices of bread for the communion, and Philip was privileged to cut off the crust. He was sent to the study to fetch a marble paperweight, with which Mr. Carey pressed the bread till it was thin and pulpy, and then it was cut into small squares. The amount was regulated by the weather. On a very bad day few people came to church, and on a very fine one, though many came, few stayed for communion. There were most when it was dry enough to make the walk to church pleasant, but not so fine that people wanted to hurry away.
<br> 
<br> Then Mrs. Carey brought the communion plate out of the safe, which stood in the pantry, and the Vicar polished it with a chamois leather. At ten the fly drove up, and Mr. Carey got into his boots. Mrs. Carey took several minutes to put on her bonnet, during which the Vicar, in a voluminous cloak, stood in the hall with just such an expression on his face as would have become an early Christian about to be led into the arena. It was extraordinary that after thirty years of marriage his wife could not be ready in time on Sunday morning. At last she came, in black satin; the Vicar did not like colours in a clergyman’s wife at any time, but on Sundays he was determined that she should wear black; now and then, in conspiracy with Miss Graves, she ventured a white feather or a pink rose in her bonnet, but the Vicar insisted that it should disappear; he said he would not go to church with the scarlet woman: Mrs. Carey sighed as a woman but obeyed as a wife. They were about to step into the carriage when the Vicar remembered that no one had given him his egg. They knew that he must have an egg for his voice, there were two women in the house, and no one had the least regard for his comfort. Mrs. Carey scolded Mary Ann, and Mary Ann answered that she could not think of everything. She hurried away to fetch an egg, and Mrs. Carey beat it up in a glass of sherry. The Vicar swallowed it at a gulp. The communion plate was stowed in the carriage, and they set off.
<br> 
<br> The fly came from The Red Lion and had a peculiar smell of stale straw. They drove with both windows closed so that the Vicar should not catch cold. The sexton was waiting at the porch to take the communion plate, and while the Vicar went to the vestry Mrs. Carey and Philip settled themselves in the vicarage pew. Mrs. Carey placed in front of her the sixpenny bit she was accustomed to put in the plate, and gave Philip threepence for the same purpose. The church filled up gradually and the service began.
<br> 
<br> Philip grew bored during the sermon, but if he fidgetted Mrs. Carey put a gentle hand on his arm and looked at him reproachfully. He regained interest when the final hymn was sung and Mr.Graves passed round with the plate.
<br> 
<br> When everyone had gone Mrs. Carey went into Miss Graves’ pew to have a few words with her while they were waiting for the gentlemen, and Philip went to the vestry. His uncle, the curate, and Mr. Graves were still in their surplices. Mr. Carey gave him the remains of the consecrated bread and told him he might eat it. He had been accustomed to eat it himself, as it seemed blasphemous to throw it away, but Philip’s keen appetite relieved him from the duty. Then they counted the money. It consisted of pennies, sixpences and threepenny bits. There were always two single shillings, one put in the plate by the Vicar and the other by Mr. Graves; and sometimes there was a florin. Mr. Graves told the Vicar who had given this. It was always a stranger to Blackstable, and Mr. Carey wondered who he was. But Miss Graves had observed the rash act and was able to tell Mrs. Carey that the stranger came from London, was married and had children. During the drive home Mrs. Carey passed the information on, and the Vicar made up his mind to call on him and ask for a subscription to the Additional Curates Society. Mr. Carey asked if Philip had behaved properly; and Mrs. Carey remarked that Mrs. Wigram had a new mantle, Mr. Cox was not in church, and somebody thought that Miss Phillips was engaged. When they reached the vicarage they all felt that they deserved a substantial dinner.
<br> 
<br> When this was over Mrs. Carey went to her room to rest, and Mr. Carey lay down on the sofa in the drawing-room for forty winks.
<br> 
<br> They had tea at five, and the Vicar ate an egg to support himself for evensong. Mrs. Carey did not go to this so that Mary Ann might, but she read the service through and the hymns. Mr. Carey walked to church in the evening, and Philip limped along by his side. The walk through the darkness along the country road strangely impressed him, and the church with all its lights in the distance, coming gradually nearer, seemed very friendly. At first he was shy with his uncle, but little by little grew used to him, and he would slip his hand in his uncle’s and walk more easily for the feeling of protection.
<br> 
<br> They had supper when they got home. Mr. Carey’s slippers were waiting for him on a footstool in front of the fire and by their side Philip’s, one the shoe of a small boy, the other misshapen and odd. He was dreadfully tired when he went up to bed, and he did not resist when Mary Ann undressed him. She kissed him after she tucked him up, and he began to love her.

<br> 第七章
<br> 
<br> 星期日这天，事情排得满满的。凯里先生老爱自诩：整个教区内，每周工作七天的就他一个。
<br> 
<br> 这天，全家都比平常提早半小时起身。玛丽·安准八点前来敲房门，这时凯里先生总免不了要嘀咕一句：当牧师的真苦命，休息日也休想在床上多躺一会儿。凯里太太这天花在穿衣服上的时间也要多些，梳妆打扮到九点才气喘吁吁地下楼用早餐，正好先于丈夫一步。凯里先生的靴于搁在火炉前，好让它烘烘暖和。做祷告的时间要比平日长，早餐也比往常丰盛。早餐后，牧师着手准备圣餐，把面包切成薄片；菲利普很荣幸，能在一旁帮着削面包皮。牧师差菲利普去书房取来一块大理石镇纸，用它压面包。等面包片压得又薄又软了，再把它们切成许多小方块。数量的多寡，视天气而定。刮风下雨天，上教堂的人寥寥无几；如果天气特好，做礼拜的教友固然济济一堂，但留下来用圣餐的也不会很多。要是大既不下雨，同时又算不上风和日丽，上教堂走一遭尚不失为快事，教友们也并不急着去领略假日的乐趣-一逢上这种日子，领圣餐的人才会很多。
<br> 
<br> 随后，凯里太太从餐具室的菜橱里取出圣餐盘，牧师用块羚羊皮将'Z擦得锃亮锃亮。十时，马车停到了门口，凯里先生穿好靴子。凯里太太花了好几分钟工夫才戴好她那顶无边帽，这期间，牧师披着件宽肥的大憋，候在门厅里，脸上那副神情，活像古代的基督徒，正等着被领人竞技场似的。真奇怪，结婚三十年了，老婆子每到星期天早晨还老是这么磨磨蹭蹭的。她总算姗姗而来了，身上穿着一袭黑缎子衣服。不管什么场合，牧师一看到教士老婆披红戴绿就觉得不顺眼；到星期天，他更是坚持老伴非穿一身黑不可。有几次，凯里太太同格雷夫斯小姐串通好，鼓起勇气在无边帽上插一根白羽毛，或是缀一朵粉红玫瑰什么的，但牧师执意要把它们拿掉，说他不愿意同妖艳的荡妇一块儿上教堂。作为妇人，凯里太太忍不住一声长叹；而作为妻子，她又不得不唯命是从。他们正要上马车的时候，牧师忽然记起家里人今天还没给他吃过鸡蛋。她们明明知道他得吃个鸡蛋润润喉咙；家里有两个女的，可没有一个把他的饮食起居放在心上。凯里太太埋怨玛丽·安，可玛丽·安却回嘴说，她一个人哪能什么事都考虑周全。玛丽·安赶紧去把鸡蛋拿来；凯里太太随手将蛋打入一杯雪利酒里。牧师一口吞下了肚。圣餐盘放进马车，他们出发了。
<br> 
<br> 这辆单马马车是"红狮"车行放来的，车里一股霉稻草的怪味。一路上，两面车窗关得严严实实，生怕牧师着了凉。守候在教堂门廊处的教堂执事，将圣餐盘接了过去。牧师径自朝法衣室走去，凯里太太和菲利普则人牧师家族席坐定。凯里太太在自己面前放了枚六便士的钱币，每回她投在圣餐盘里的就是这点钱，同时还给了菲利普一枚三便士的小钱，派同样的用场。教堂里渐渐坐满了，礼拜随之开始。
<br> 
<br> 牧师的讲道，菲利普听着听着，不觉厌倦起来。可是只要他稍一挪动身子，凯里太太马上伸手将他胳臂轻轻按住，同时用责备的目光盯他一眼。等最后一支圣歌唱完，格雷夫斯先生端着圣餐盘分发圣餐的时候，菲利普的兴致又浓了。
<br> 
<br> 做礼拜的人全离开了教堂，凯里太太走到格雷夫斯小姐的座席跟前，趁等候牧师他们的当儿，同格雷夫斯小姐闲聊几句；而菲利普此时却一溜烟进了法衣室。大伯、副牧师和格雷夫斯先生，还都穿着白法衣。凯里先生将剩下的圣餐给了菲利普，叫他吃了。过去一向是他自己吃掉的，因为扔掉了似乎是对神明的亵渎；菲利普食欲旺盛，现在正好由他代劳。然后他们清点盘里的钱币，里面有一便士的，有六便士的，也有三便士的。每回都有两枚一先令的钱币。一枚是牧师放进去的，另一枚是格雷夫斯先生放的；间或还冒出枚弗罗林银币来。格雷夫斯先生告诉牧师银币是谁奉献的，往往是某个来布莱克斯泰勃作客的外乡人。凯里先生暗暗纳闷，这位施主究竟是什么样人。不过格雷夫斯小姐早已将这种轻率举动看在眼里，而且能在凯里太太面前说出外乡人的底细：他是从伦敦来的，结过婚，而且有孩子。在乘车回家的路上，凯里太太透露了这个消息，于是凯里先生打定主意要亲自登门拜访，请这位施主为"编外副牧师协会"慷慨解囊。凯里先生问起菲利普刚才在教堂里是否守规矩，可凯里太太却唠叨着威格拉姆太太穿了件新斗篷啦，考克斯先生没来做礼拜啦，以及有人认为菲利普斯小姐已经订了婚啦。他们回到家里，个个觉得折腾了一个上午，理当美美地饱餐一顿。
<br> 
<br> 饭后，凯里太太回自己房里休息去了。凯里先生躺在客厅的长沙发上，忙里偷闲打个盹儿。
<br> 
<br> 下午五时进茶点，牧师特地吃了个鸡蛋，免得主持晚祷时支撑不住。凯里太太为了让玛丽·安去教堂参加晚祷，自己就留在家里了，不过她照样念祈祷文，吟诵圣诗。晚上，凯里先生步行去教堂，菲利普一瘸一拐地跟随在他身边。晚间在乡村小路上行走，菲利普觉得有种新奇之感。远处灯火通明的教堂，一点儿一点儿靠近过来，似乎显得分外亲切。起初，菲利普在他大伯跟前还有点怯生，后来慢慢相处惯了，他常把手悄悄伸进大伯的手掌里，他感到有人在保护自己，跨步时就比较从容自在了。
<br> 
<br> 他们一回到家里，就开始吃晚饭。凯里先生的拖鞋已准备好，端放在火炉前的脚凳上；菲利普的拖鞋也搁在旁边：其中一只，和普通小男孩的鞋没什么两样，另一只却呈畸形，样子很怪。菲利普上楼睡觉时已经累坏了，只得听任玛丽·安帮他脱衣服。玛丽·安给菲利普盖好被子，顺势亲了亲他；菲利普开始喜欢她了。
