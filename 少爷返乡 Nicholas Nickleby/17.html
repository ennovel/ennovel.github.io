<p>　　It was with a heavy heart, and many sad forebodings which noeffort could banish, that Kate Nickleby, on the morningappointed for the commencement of her engagement withMadame Mantalini, left the city when its clocks yet wanted aquarter of an hour of eight, and threaded her way alone, amid thenoise and bustle of the streets, towards the west end of London.</p> 
<p>　　At this early hour many sickly girls, whose business, like that ofthe poor worm, is to produce, with patient toil, the finery thatbedecks the thoughtless and luxurious, traverse our streets,making towards the scene of their daily labour, and catching, as ifby stealth, in their hurried walk, the only gasp of wholesome airand glimpse of sunlight which cheer their monotonous existenceduring the long train of hours that make a working day. As shedrew nigh to the more fashionable quarter of the town, Katemarked many of this class as they passed by, hurrying like herselfto their painful occupation, and saw, in their unhealthy looks andfeeble gait, but too clear an evidence that her misgivings were notwholly groundless.</p> 
<p>　　She arrived at Madame Mantalini’s some minutes before theappointed hour, and after walking a few times up and down, in thehope that some other female might arrive and spare her theembarrassment of stating her business to the servant, knockedtimidly at the door: which, after some delay, was opened by thefootman, who had been putting on his striped jacket as he came upstairs, and was now intent on fastening his apron.</p> 
<p>　　‘Is Madame Mantalini in?’ faltered Kate.</p> 
<p>　　‘Not often out at this time, miss,’ replied the man in a tonewhich rendered “Miss,” something more offensive than “My dear.”</p> 
<p>　　‘Can I see her?’ asked Kate.</p> 
<p>　　‘Eh?’ replied the man, holding the door in his hand, andhonouring the inquirer with a stare and a broad grin, ‘Lord, no.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I came by her own appointment,’ said Kate; ‘I am—I am—to beemployed here.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh! you should have rung the worker’s bell,’ said the footman,touching the handle of one in the door-post. ‘Let me see, though, Iforgot—Miss Nickleby, is it?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes,’ replied Kate.</p> 
<p>　　‘You’re to walk upstairs then, please,’ said the man. ‘MadameMantalini wants to see you—this way—take care of these things onthe floor.’</p> 
<p>　　Cautioning her, in these terms, not to trip over a heterogeneouslitter of pastry-cook’s trays, lamps, waiters full of glasses, and pilesof rout seats which were strewn about the hall, plainly bespeakinga late party on the previous night, the man led the way to thesecond story, and ushered Kate into a back-room, communicatingby folding-doors with the apartment in which she had first seenthe mistress of the establishment.</p> 
<p>　　‘If you’ll wait here a minute,’ said the man, ‘I’ll tell herpresently.’ Having made this promise with much affability, heretired and left Kate alone.</p> 
<p>　　There was not much to amuse in the room; of which the mostattractive feature was, a half-length portrait in oil, of Mr Mantalini,whom the artist had depicted scratching his head in an easy manner, and thus displaying to advantage a diamond ring, the giftof Madame Mantalini before her marriage. There was, however,the sound of voices in conversation in the next room; and as theconversation was loud and the partition thin, Kate could not helpdiscovering that they belonged to Mr and Mrs Mantalini.</p> 
<p>　　‘If you will be odiously, demnebly, outrigeously jealous, mysoul,’ said Mr Mantalini, ‘you will be very miserable—horridmiserable—demnition miserable.’ And then, there was a sound asthough Mr Mantalini were sipping his coffee.</p> 
<p>　　‘I am miserable,’ returned Madame Mantalini, evidentlypouting.</p> 
<p>　　‘Then you are an ungrateful, unworthy, demd unthankful littlefairy,’ said Mr Mantalini.</p> 
<p>　　‘I am not,’ returned Madame, with a sob.</p> 
<p>　　‘Do not put itself out of humour,’ said Mr Mantalini, breakingan egg. ‘It is a pretty, bewitching little demd countenance, and itshould not be out of humour, for it spoils its loveliness, and makesit cross and gloomy like a frightful, naughty, demd hobgoblin.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I am not to be brought round in that way, always,’ rejoinedMadame, sulkily.</p> 
<p>　　‘It shall be brought round in any way it likes best, and notbrought round at all if it likes that better,’ retorted Mr Mantalini,with his egg-spoon in his mouth.</p> 
<p>　　‘It’s very easy to talk,’ said Mrs Mantalini.</p> 
<p>　　‘Not so easy when one is eating a demnition egg,’ replied MrMantalini; ‘for the yolk runs down the waistcoat, and yolk of eggdoes not match any waistcoat but a yellow waistcoat, demmit.’</p> 
<p>　　‘You were flirting with her during the whole night,’ saidMadame Mantalini, apparently desirous to lead the conversation back to the point from which it had strayed.</p> 
<p>　　‘No, no, my life.’</p> 
<p>　　‘You were,’ said Madame; ‘I had my eye upon you all the time.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Bless the little winking twinkling eye; was it on me all thetime!’ cried Mantalini, in a sort of lazy rapture. ‘Oh, demmit!’</p> 
<p>　　‘And I say once more,’ resumed Madame, ‘that you ought not towaltz with anybody but your own wife; and I will not bear it,Mantalini, if I take poison first.’</p> 
<p>　　‘She will not take poison and have horrid pains, will she?’ saidMantalini; who, by the altered sound of his voice, seemed to havemoved his chair, and taken up his position nearer to his wife. ‘Shewill not take poison, because she had a demd fine husband whomight have married two countesses and a dowager—’</p> 
<p>　　‘Two countesses,’ interposed Madame. ‘You told me onebefore!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Two!’ cried Mantalini. ‘Two demd fine women, real countessesand splendid fortunes, demmit.’</p> 
<p>　　‘And why didn’t you?’ asked Madame, playfully.</p> 
<p>　　‘Why didn’t I!’ replied her husband. ‘Had I not seen, at amorning concert, the demdest little fascinator in all the world, andwhile that little fascinator is my wife, may not all the countessesand dowagers in England be—’</p> 
<p>　　Mr Mantalini did not finish the sentence, but he gave MadameMantalini a very loud kiss, which Madame Mantalini returned;after which, there seemed to be some more kissing mixed up withthe progress of the breakfast.</p> 
<p>　　‘And what about the cash, my existence’s jewel?’ saidMantalini, when these endearments ceased. ‘How much have wein hand?’</p> 
<p>　　 ‘Very little indeed,’ replied Madame.</p> 
<p>　　‘We must have some more,’ said Mantalini; ‘we must have somediscount out of old Nickleby to carry on the war with, demmit.’</p> 
<p>　　‘You can’t want any more just now,’ said Madame coaxingly.</p> 
<p>　　‘My life and soul,’ returned her husband, ‘there is a horse forsale at Scrubbs’s, which it would be a sin and a crime to lose—going, my senses’ joy, for nothing.’</p> 
<p>　　‘For nothing,’ cried Madame, ‘I am glad of that.’</p> 
<p>　　‘For actually nothing,’ replied Mantalini. ‘A hundred guineasdown will buy him; mane, and crest, and legs, and tail, all of thedemdest beauty. I will ride him in the park before the verychariots of the rejected countesses. The demd old dowager willfaint with grief and rage; the other two will say “He is married, hehas made away with himself, it is a demd thing, it is all up!” Theywill hate each other demnebly, and wish you dead and buried. Ha!</p> 
<p>　　ha! Demmit.’</p> 
<p>　　Madame Mantalini’s prudence, if she had any, was not proofagainst these triumphal pictures; after a little jingling of keys, sheobserved that she would see what her desk contained, and risingfor that purpose, opened the folding-door, and walked into theroom where Kate was seated.</p> 
<p>　　‘Dear me, child!’ exclaimed Madame Mantalini, recoiling insurprise. ‘How came you here?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Child!’ cried Mantalini, hurrying in. ‘How came—eh!—oh—demmit, how d’ye do?’</p> 
<p>　　‘I have been waiting, here some time, ma’am,’ said Kate,addressing Madame Mantalini. ‘The servant must have forgottento let you know that I was here, I think.’</p> 
<p>　　‘You really must see to that man,’ said Madame, turning to her husband. ‘He forgets everything.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I will twist his demd nose off his countenance for leaving sucha very pretty creature all alone by herself,’ said her husband.</p> 
<p>　　‘Mantalini,’ cried Madame, ‘you forget yourself.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I don’t forget you, my soul, and never shall, and never can,’</p> 
<p>　　said Mantalini, kissing his wife’s hand, and grimacing aside, toMiss Nickleby, who turned away.</p> 
<p>　　Appeased by this compliment, the lady of the business tooksome papers from her desk which she handed over to MrMantalini, who received them with great delight. She thenrequested Kate to follow her, and after several feints on the part ofMr Mantalini to attract the young lady’s attention, they went away:</p> 
<p>　　leaving that gentleman extended at full length on the sofa, with hisheels in the air and a newspaper in his hand.</p> 
<p>　　Madame Mantalini led the way down a flight of stairs, andthrough a passage, to a large room at the back of the premiseswhere were a number of young women employed in sewing,cutting out, making up, altering, and various other processesknown only to those who are cunning in the arts of millinery anddressmaking. It was a close room with a skylight, and as dull andquiet as a room need be.</p> 
<p>　　On Madame Mantalini calling aloud for Miss Knag, a short,bustling, over-dressed female, full of importance, presentedherself, and all the young ladies suspending their operations forthe moment, whispered to each other sundry criticisms upon themake and texture of Miss Nickleby’s dress, her complexion, cast offeatures, and personal appearance, with as much good breeding ascould have been displayed by the very best society in a crowdedball-room.</p> 
<p>　　 ‘Oh, Miss Knag,’ said Madame Mantalini, ‘this is the youngperson I spoke to you about.’</p> 
<p>　　Miss Knag bestowed a reverential smile upon MadameMantalini, which she dexterously transformed into a gracious onefor Kate, and said that certainly, although it was a great deal oftrouble to have young people who were wholly unused to thebusiness, still, she was sure the young person would try to do herbest—impressed with which conviction she (Miss Knag) felt aninterest in her, already.</p> 
<p>　　‘I think that, for the present at all events, it will be better forMiss Nickleby to come into the show-room with you, and trythings on for people,’ said Madame Mantalini. ‘She will not be ablefor the present to be of much use in any other way; and herappearance will—’</p> 
<p>　　‘Suit very well with mine, Madame Mantalini,’ interrupted MissKnag. ‘So it will; and to be sure I might have known that youwould not be long in finding that out; for you have so much tastein all those matters, that really, as I often say to the young ladies, Ido not know how, when, or where, you possibly could haveacquired all you know—hem—Miss Nickleby and I are quite apair, Madame Mantalini, only I am a little darker than MissNickleby, and—hem—I think my foot may be a little smaller. MissNickleby, I am sure, will not be offended at my saying that, whenshe hears that our family always have been celebrated for smallfeet ever since—hem—ever since our family had any feet at all,indeed, I think. I had an uncle once, Madame Mantalini, who livedin Cheltenham, and had a most excellent business as atobacconist—hem—who had such small feet, that they were nobigger than those which are usually joined to wooden legs—the most symmetrical feet, Madame Mantalini, that even you canimagine.’</p> 
<p>　　‘They must have had something of the appearance of club feet,Miss Knag,’ said Madame.</p> 
<p>　　‘Well now, that is so like you,’ returned Miss Knag, ‘Ha! ha! ha!</p> 
<p>　　Of club feet! Oh very good! As I often remark to the young ladies,“Well I must say, and I do not care who knows it, of all the readyhumour—hem—I ever heard anywhere”—and I have heard a gooddeal; for when my dear brother was alive (I kept house for him,Miss Nickleby), we had to supper once a week two or three youngmen, highly celebrated in those days for their humour, MadameMantalini—“Of all the ready humour,” I say to the young ladies, “Iever heard, Madame Mantalini’s is the most remarkable—hem. Itis so gentle, so sarcastic, and yet so good-natured (as I wasobserving to Miss Simmonds only this morning), that how, orwhen, or by what means she acquired it, is to me a mysteryindeed.”’</p> 
<p>　　Here Miss Knag paused to take breath, and while she pauses itmay be observed—not that she was marvellously loquacious andmarvellously deferential to Madame Mantalini, since these arefacts which require no comment; but that every now and then, shewas accustomed, in the torrent of her discourse, to introduce aloud, shrill, clear ‘hem!’ the import and meaning of which, wasvariously interpreted by her acquaintance; some holding that MissKnag dealt in exaggeration, and introduced the monosyllablewhen any fresh invention was in course of coinage in her brain;others, that when she wanted a word, she threw it in to gain time,and prevent anybody else from striking into the conversation. Itmay be further remarked, that Miss Knag still aimed at youth, although she had shot beyond it, years ago; and that she was weakand vain, and one of those people who are best described by theaxiom, that you may trust them as far as you can see them, and nofarther.</p> 
<p>　　‘You’ll take care that Miss Nickleby understands her hours, andso forth,’ said Madame Mantalini; ‘and so I’ll leave her with you.</p> 
<p>　　You’ll not forget my directions, Miss Knag?’</p> 
<p>　　Miss Knag of course replied, that to forget anything MadameMantalini had directed, was a moral impossibility; and that lady,dispensing a general good-morning among her assistants, sailedaway.</p> 
<p>　　‘Charming creature, isn’t she, Miss Nickleby?’ said Miss Knag,rubbing her hands together.</p> 
<p>　　‘I have seen very little of her,’ said Kate. ‘I hardly know yet.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Have you seen Mr Mantalini?’ inquired Miss Knag.</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes; I have seen him twice.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Isn’t he a charming creature?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Indeed he does not strike me as being so, by any means,’</p> 
<p>　　replied Kate.</p> 
<p>　　‘No, my dear!’ cried Miss Knag, elevating her hands. ‘Why,goodness gracious mercy, where’s your taste? Such a fine tall, full-whiskered dashing gentlemanly man, with such teeth and hair,and—hem—well now, you do astonish me.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I dare say I am very foolish,’ replied Kate, laying aside herbonnet; ‘but as my opinion is of very little importance to him oranyone else, I do not regret having formed it, and shall be slow tochange it, I think.’</p> 
<p>　　‘He is a very fine man, don’t you think so?’ asked one of theyoung ladies.</p> 
<p>　　 ‘Indeed he may be, for anything I could say to the contrary,’</p> 
<p>　　replied Kate.</p> 
<p>　　‘And drives very beautiful horses, doesn’t he?’ inquiredanother.</p> 
<p>　　‘I dare say he may, but I never saw them,’ answered Kate.</p> 
<p>　　‘Never saw them!’ interposed Miss Knag. ‘Oh, well! There it isat once you know; how can you possibly pronounce an opinionabout a gentleman—hem—if you don’t see him as he turns outaltogether?’</p> 
<p>　　There was so much of the world—even of the little world of thecountry girl—in this idea of the old milliner, that Kate, who wasanxious, for every reason, to change the subject, made no furtherremark, and left Miss Knag in possession of the field.</p> 
<p>　　After a short silence, during which most of the young peoplemade a closer inspection of Kate’s appearance, and comparednotes respecting it, one of them offered to help her off with hershawl, and the offer being accepted, inquired whether she did notfind black very uncomfortable wear.</p> 
<p>　　‘I do indeed,’ replied Kate, with a bitter sigh.</p> 
<p>　　‘So dusty and hot,’ observed the same speaker, adjusting herdress for her.</p> 
<p>　　Kate might have said, that mourning is sometimes the coldestwear which mortals can assume; that it not only chills the breastsof those it clothes, but extending its influence to summer friends,freezes up their sources of good-will and kindness, and witheringall the buds of promise they once so liberally put forth, leavesnothing but bared and rotten hearts exposed. There are few whohave lost a friend or relative constituting in life their soledependence, who have not keenly felt this chilling influence of their sable garb. She had felt it acutely, and feeling it at themoment, could not quite restrain her tears.</p> 
<p>　　‘I am very sorry to have wounded you by my thoughtlessspeech,’ said her companion. ‘I did not think of it. You are inmourning for some near relation?’</p> 
<p>　　‘For my father,’ answered Kate.</p> 
<p>　　‘For what relation, Miss Simmonds?’ asked Miss Knag, in anaudible voice.</p> 
<p>　　‘Her father,’ replied the other softly.</p> 
<p>　　‘Her father, eh?’ said Miss Knag, without the slightestdepression of her voice. ‘Ah! A long illness, Miss Simmonds?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Hush,’ replied the girl; ‘I don’t know.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Our misfortune was very sudden,’ said Kate, turning away, ‘or Imight perhaps, at a time like this, be enabled to support it better.’</p> 
<p>　　There had existed not a little desire in the room, according toinvariable custom, when any new ‘young person’ came, to knowwho Kate was, and what she was, and all about her; but, althoughit might have been very naturally increased by her appearanceand emotion, the knowledge that it pained her to be questioned,was sufficient to repress even this curiosity; and Miss Knag,finding it hopeless to attempt extracting any further particularsjust then, reluctantly commanded silence, and bade the workproceed.</p> 
<p>　　In silence, then, the tasks were plied until half-past one, when abaked leg of mutton, with potatoes to correspond, were served inthe kitchen. The meal over, and the young ladies having enjoyedthe additional relaxation of washing their hands, the work beganagain, and was again performed in silence, until the noise ofcarriages rattling through the streets, and of loud double knocks at doors, gave token that the day’s work of the more fortunatemembers of society was proceeding in its turn.</p> 
<p>　　One of these double knocks at Madame Mantalini’s door,announced the equipage of some great lady—or rather rich one,for there is occasionally a distinction between riches andgreatness—who had come with her daughter to approve of somecourt-dresses which had been a long time preparing, and uponwhom Kate was deputed to wait, accompanied by Miss Knag, andofficered of course by Madame Mantalini.</p> 
<p>　　Kate’s part in the pageant was humble enough, her duties beinglimited to holding articles of costume until Miss Knag was ready totry them on, and now and then tying a string, or fastening a hook-and-eye. She might, not unreasonably, have supposed herselfbeneath the reach of any arrogance, or bad humour; but ithappened that the lady and daughter were both out of temper thatday, and the poor girl came in for her share of their revilings. Shewas awkward—her hands were cold—dirty—coarse—she could donothing right; they wondered how Madame Mantalini could havesuch people about her; requested they might see some otheryoung woman the next time they came; and so forth.</p> 
<p>　　So common an occurrence would be hardly deserving ofmention, but for its effect. Kate shed many bitter tears when thesepeople were gone, and felt, for the first time, humbled by heroccupation. She had, it is true, quailed at the prospect of drudgeryand hard service; but she had felt no degradation in working forher bread, until she found herself exposed to insolence and pride.</p> 
<p>　　Philosophy would have taught her that the degradation was on theside of those who had sunk so low as to display such passionshabitually, and without cause: but she was too young for such consolation, and her honest feeling was hurt. May not thecomplaint, that common people are above their station, often takeits rise in the fact of uncommon people being below theirs?</p> 
<p>　　In such scenes and occupations the time wore on until nineo’clock, when Kate, jaded and dispirited with the occurrences ofthe day, hastened from the confinement of the workroom, to joinher mother at the street corner, and walk home:—the more sadly,from having to disguise her real feelings, and feign to participatein all the sanguine visions of her companion.</p> 
<p>　　‘Bless my soul, Kate,’ said Mrs Nickleby; ‘I’ve been thinking allday what a delightful thing it would be for Madame Mantalini totake you into partnership—such a likely thing too, you know! Why,your poor dear papa’s cousin’s sister-in-law—a Miss Browndock—was taken into partnership by a lady that kept a school atHammersmith, and made her fortune in no time at all. I forget, by-the-bye, whether that Miss Browndock was the same lady that gotthe ten thousand pounds prize in the lottery, but I think she was;indeed, now I come to think of it, I am sure she was. “Mantaliniand Nickleby”, how well it would sound!—and if Nicholas has anygood fortune, you might have Doctor Nickleby, the head-master ofWestminster School, living in the same street.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Dear Nicholas!’ cried Kate, taking from her reticule herbrother’s letter from Dotheboys Hall. ‘In all our misfortunes, howhappy it makes me, mama, to hear he is doing well, and to findhim writing in such good spirits! It consoles me for all we mayundergo, to think that he is comfortable and happy.’</p> 
<p>　　Poor Kate! she little thought how weak her consolation was,and how soon she would be undeceived.</p>
