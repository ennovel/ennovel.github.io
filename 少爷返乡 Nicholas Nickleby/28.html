<p>　　The ensuing morning brought reflection with it, as morningusually does; but widely different was the train of thoughtit awakened in the different persons who had been sounexpectedly brought together on the preceding evening, by theactive agency of Messrs Pyke and Pluck.</p> 
<p>　　The reflections of Sir Mulberry Hawk—if such a term can beapplied to the thoughts of the systematic and calculating man ofdissipation, whose joys, regrets, pains, and pleasures, are all ofself, and who would seem to retain nothing of the intellectualfaculty but the power to debase himself, and to degrade the verynature whose outward semblance he wears—the reflections of SirMulberry Hawk turned upon Kate Nickleby, and were, in brief,that she was undoubtedly handsome; that her coyness must beeasily conquerable by a man of his address and experience, andthat the pursuit was one which could not fail to redound to hiscredit, and greatly to enhance his reputation with the world. Andlest this last consideration—no mean or secondary one with SirMulberry—should sound strangely in the ears of some, let it beremembered that most men live in a world of their own, and that in that limited circle alone are they ambitious for distinction andapplause. Sir Mulberry’s world was peopled with profligates, andhe acted accordingly.</p> 
<p>　　Thus, cases of injustice, and oppression, and tyranny, and themost extravagant bigotry, are in constant occurrence among usevery day. It is the custom to trumpet forth much wonder andastonishment at the chief actors therein setting at defiance socompletely the opinion of the world; but there is no greater fallacy;it is precisely because they do consult the opinion of their ownlittle world that such things take place at all, and strike the greatworld dumb with amazement.</p> 
<p>　　The reflections of Mrs Nickleby were of the proudest and mostcomplacent kind; and under the influence of her very agreeabledelusion she straightway sat down and indited a long letter toKate, in which she expressed her entire approval of the admirablechoice she had made, and extolled Sir Mulberry to the skies;asserting, for the more complete satisfaction of her daughter’sfeelings, that he was precisely the individual whom she (MrsNickleby) would have chosen for her son-in-law, if she had had thepicking and choosing from all mankind. The good lady then, withthe preliminary observation that she might be fairly supposed notto have lived in the world so long without knowing its ways,communicated a great many subtle precepts applicable to thestate of courtship, and confirmed in their wisdom by her ownpersonal experience. Above all things she commended a strictmaidenly reserve, as being not only a very laudable thing in itself,but as tending materially to strengthen and increase a lover’sardour. ‘And I never,’ added Mrs Nickleby, ‘was more delighted inmy life than to observe last night, my dear, that your good sense had already told you this.’ With which sentiment, and varioushints of the pleasure she derived from the knowledge that herdaughter inherited so large an instalment of her own excellentsense and discretion (to nearly the full measure of which shemight hope, with care, to succeed in time), Mrs Nicklebyconcluded a very long and rather illegible letter.</p> 
<p>　　Poor Kate was well-nigh distracted on the receipt of fourclosely-written and closely-crossed sides of congratulation on thevery subject which had prevented her closing her eyes all night,and kept her weeping and watching in her chamber; still worseand more trying was the necessity of rendering herself agreeableto Mrs Wititterly, who, being in low spirits after the fatigue of thepreceding night, of course expected her companion (elsewherefore had she board and salary?) to be in the best spiritspossible. As to Mr Wititterly, he went about all day in a tremor ofdelight at having shaken hands with a lord, and having actuallyasked him to come and see him in his own house. The lordhimself, not being troubled to any inconvenient extent with thepower of thinking, regaled himself with the conversation of MessrsPyke and Pluck, who sharpened their wit by a plentiful indulgencein various costly stimulants at his expense.</p> 
<p>　　It was four in the afternoon—that is, the vulgar afternoon of thesun and the clock—and Mrs Wititterly reclined, according tocustom, on the drawing-room sofa, while Kate read aloud a newnovel in three volumes, entitled ‘The Lady Flabella,’ whichAlphonse the doubtful had procured from the library that verymorning. And it was a production admirably suited to a ladylabouring under Mrs Wititterly’s complaint, seeing that there wasnot a line in it, from beginning to end, which could, by the most remote contingency, awaken the smallest excitement in anyperson breathing.</p> 
<p>　　Kate read on.</p> 
<p>　　‘“Cherizette,” said the Lady Flabella, inserting her mouse-likefeet in the blue satin slippers, which had unwittingly occasionedthe half-playful half-angry altercation between herself and theyouthful Colonel Befillaire, in the Duke of Mincefenille’s salon dedanse on the previous night. “Cherizette, ma chère, donnez-moi del’eau-de-Cologne, s’il vous pla.t, mon enfant.”</p> 
<p>　　‘“Merci—thank you,” said the Lady Flabella, as the lively butdevoted Cherizette plentifully besprinkled with the fragrantcompound the Lady Flabella’s mouchoir of finest cambric, edgedwith richest lace, and emblazoned at the four corners with theFlabella crest, and gorgeous heraldic bearings of that noble family.</p> 
<p>　　“Merci—that will do.”</p> 
<p>　　‘At this instant, while the Lady Flabella yet inhaled thatdelicious fragrance by holding the mouchoir to her exquisite, butthoughtfully-chiselled nose, the door of the boudoir (artfullyconcealed by rich hangings of silken damask, the hue of Italy’sfirmament) was thrown open, and with noiseless tread two valets-de-chambre, clad in sumptuous liveries of peach-blossom and gold,advanced into the room followed by a page in bas de soie—silkstockings—who, while they remained at some distance making themost graceful obeisances, advanced to the feet of his lovelymistress, and dropping on one knee presented, on a golden salvergorgeously chased, a scented billet.</p> 
<p>　　‘The Lady Flabella, with an agitation she could not repress,hastily tore off the envelope and broke the scented seal. It wasfrom Befillaire—the young, the slim, the low-voiced—her own Befillaire.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh, charming!’ interrupted Kate’s patroness, who wassometimes taken literary. ‘Poetic, really. Read that descriptionagain, Miss Nickleby.’</p> 
<p>　　Kate complied.</p> 
<p>　　‘Sweet, indeed!’ said Mrs Wititterly, with a sigh. ‘So voluptuous,is it not—so soft?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, I think it is,’ replied Kate, gently; ‘very soft.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Close the book, Miss Nickleby,’ said Mrs Wititterly. ‘I can hearnothing more today; I should be sorry to disturb the impression ofthat sweet description. Close the book.’</p> 
<p>　　Kate complied, not unwillingly; and, as she did so, MrsWititterly raising her glass with a languid hand, remarked, thatshe looked pale.</p> 
<p>　　‘It was the fright of that—that noise and confusion last night,’</p> 
<p>　　said Kate.</p> 
<p>　　‘How very odd!’ exclaimed Mrs Wititterly, with a look ofsurprise. And certainly, when one comes to think of it, it was veryodd that anything should have disturbed a companion. A steam-engine, or other ingenious piece of mechanism out of order, wouldhave been nothing to it.</p> 
<p>　　‘How did you come to know Lord Frederick, and those otherdelightful creatures, child?’ asked Mrs Wititterly, still eyeing Katethrough her glass.</p> 
<p>　　‘I met them at my uncle’s,’ said Kate, vexed to feel that she wascolouring deeply, but unable to keep down the blood which rushedto her face whenever she thought of that man.</p> 
<p>　　‘Have you known them long?’</p> 
<p>　　‘No,’ rejoined Kate. ‘Not long.’</p> 
<p>　　 ‘I was very glad of the opportunity which that respectableperson, your mother, gave us of being known to them,’ said MrsWititterly, in a lofty manner. ‘Some friends of ours were on thevery point of introducing us, which makes it quite remarkable.’</p> 
<p>　　This was said lest Miss Nickleby should grow conceited on thehonour and dignity of having known four great people (for Pykeand Pluck were included among the delightful creatures), whomMrs Wititterly did not know. But as the circumstance had made noimpression one way or other upon Kate’s mind, the force of theobservation was quite lost upon her.</p> 
<p>　　‘They asked permission to call,’ said Mrs Wititterly. ‘I gave itthem of course.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Do you expect them today?’ Kate ventured to inquire.</p> 
<p>　　Mrs Wititterly’s answer was lost in the noise of a tremendousrapping at the street-door, and before it had ceased to vibrate,there drove up a handsome cabriolet, out of which leaped SirMulberry Hawk and his friend Lord Verisopht.</p> 
<p>　　‘They are here now,’ said Kate, rising and hurrying away.</p> 
<p>　　‘Miss Nickleby!’ cried Mrs Wititterly, perfectly aghast at acompanion’s attempting to quit the room, without her permissionfirst had and obtained. ‘Pray don’t think of going.’</p> 
<p>　　‘You are very good!’ replied Kate. ‘But—’</p> 
<p>　　‘For goodness’ sake, don’t agitate me by making me speak somuch,’ said Mrs Wititterly, with great sharpness. ‘Dear me, MissNickleby, I beg—’</p> 
<p>　　It was in vain for Kate to protest that she was unwell, for thefootsteps of the knockers, whoever they were, were already on thestairs. She resumed her seat, and had scarcely done so, when thedoubtful page darted into the room and announced, Mr Pyke, and Mr Pluck, and Lord Verisopht, and Sir Mulberry Hawk, all at oneburst.</p> 
<p>　　‘The most extraordinary thing in the world,’ said Mr Pluck,saluting both ladies with the utmost cordiality; ‘the mostextraordinary thing. As Lord Frederick and Sir Mulberry drove upto the door, Pyke and I had that instant knocked.’</p> 
<p>　　‘That instant knocked,’ said Pyke.</p> 
<p>　　‘No matter how you came, so that you are here,’ said MrsWititterly, who, by dint of lying on the same sofa for three yearsand a half, had got up quite a little pantomime of gracefulattitudes, and now threw herself into the most striking of thewhole series, to astonish the visitors. ‘I am delighted, I am sure.’</p> 
<p>　　‘And how is Miss Nickleby?’ said Sir Mulberry Hawk, accostingKate, in a low voice—not so low, however, but that it reached theears of Mrs Wititterly.</p> 
<p>　　‘Why, she complains of suffering from the fright of last night,’</p> 
<p>　　said the lady. ‘I am sure I don’t wonder at it, for my nerves arequite torn to pieces.’</p> 
<p>　　‘And yet you look,’ observed Sir Mulberry, turning round; ‘andyet you look—’</p> 
<p>　　‘Beyond everything,’ said Mr Pyke, coming to his patron’sassistance. Of course Mr Pluck said the same.</p> 
<p>　　‘I am afraid Sir Mulberry is a flatterer, my lord,’ said MrsWititterly, turning to that young gentleman, who had been suckingthe head of his cane in silence, and staring at Kate.</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh, deyvlish!’ replied Verisopht. Having given utterance towhich remarkable sentiment, he occupied himself as before.</p> 
<p>　　‘Neither does Miss Nickleby look the worse,’ said Sir Mulberry,bending his bold gaze upon her. ‘She was always handsome, but upon my soul, ma’am, you seem to have imparted some of yourown good looks to her besides.’</p> 
<p>　　To judge from the glow which suffused the poor girl’scountenance after this speech, Mrs Wititterly might, with someshow of reason, have been supposed to have imparted to it some ofthat artificial bloom which decorated her own. Mrs Wititterlyadmitted, though not with the best grace in the world, that Katedid look pretty. She began to think, too, that Sir Mulberry was notquite so agreeable a creature as she had at first supposed him; for,although a skilful flatterer is a most delightful companion if youcan keep him all to yourself, his taste becomes very doubtful whenhe takes to complimenting other people.</p> 
<p>　　‘Pyke,’ said the watchful Mr Pluck, observing the effect whichthe praise of Miss Nickleby had produced.</p> 
<p>　　‘Well, Pluck,’ said Pyke.</p> 
<p>　　‘Is there anybody,’ demanded Mr Pluck, mysteriously, ‘anybodyyou know, that Mrs Wititterly’s profile reminds you of?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Reminds me of!’ answered Pyke. ‘Of course there is.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Who do you mean?’ said Pluck, in the same mysteriousmanner. ‘The D. of B.?’</p> 
<p>　　‘The C. of B.,’ replied Pyke, with the faintest trace of a grinlingering in his countenance. ‘The beautiful sister is the countess;not the duchess.’</p> 
<p>　　‘True,’ said Pluck, ‘the C. of B. The resemblance is wonderful!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Perfectly startling,’ said Mr Pyke.</p> 
<p>　　Here was a state of things! Mrs Wititterly was declared, uponthe testimony of two veracious and competent witnesses, to be thevery picture of a countess! This was one of the consequences ofgetting into good society. Why, she might have moved among grovelling people for twenty years, and never heard of it. Howcould she, indeed? what did they know about countesses?</p> 
<p>　　The two gentlemen having, by the greediness with which thislittle bait was swallowed, tested the extent of Mrs Wititterly’sappetite for adulation, proceeded to administer that commodity invery large doses, thus affording to Sir Mulberry Hawk anopportunity of pestering Miss Nickleby with questions andremarks, to which she was absolutely obliged to make some reply.</p> 
<p>　　Meanwhile, Lord Verisopht enjoyed unmolested the full flavour ofthe gold knob at the top of his cane, as he would have done to theend of the interview if Mr Wititterly had not come home, andcaused the conversation to turn to his favourite topic.</p> 
<p>　　‘My lord,’ said Mr Wititterly, ‘I am delighted—honoured—proud. Be seated again, my lord, pray. I am proud, indeed—mostproud.’</p> 
<p>　　It was to the secret annoyance of his wife that Mr Wititterly saidall this, for, although she was bursting with pride and arrogance,she would have had the illustrious guests believe that their visitwas quite a common occurrence, and that they had lords andbaronets to see them every day in the week. But Mr Wititterly’sfeelings were beyond the power of suppression.</p> 
<p>　　‘It is an honour, indeed!’ said Mr Wititterly. ‘Julia, my soul, youwill suffer for this tomorrow.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Suffer!’ cried Lord Verisopht.</p> 
<p>　　‘The reaction, my lord, the reaction,’ said Mr Wititterly. ‘Thisviolent strain upon the nervous system over, my lord, whatensues? A sinking, a depression, a lowness, a lassitude, a debility.</p> 
<p>　　My lord, if Sir Tumley Snuffim was to see that delicate creature atthis moment, he would not give a—a—this for her life.’ In illustration of which remark, Mr Wititterly took a pinch of snufffrom his box, and jerked it lightly into the air as an emblem ofinstability.</p> 
<p>　　‘Not THAT,’ said Mr Wititterly, looking about him with aserious countenance. ‘Sir Tumley Snuffim would not give that forMrs Wititterly’s existence.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr Wititterly told this with a kind of sober exultation, as if itwere no trifling distinction for a man to have a wife in such adesperate state, and Mrs Wititterly sighed and looked on, as if shefelt the honour, but had determined to bear it as meekly as mightbe.</p> 
<p>　　‘Mrs Wititterly,’ said her husband, ‘is Sir Tumley Snuffim’sfavourite patient. I believe I may venture to say, that MrsWititterly is the first person who took the new medicine which issupposed to have destroyed a family at Kensington Gravel Pits. Ibelieve she was. If I am wrong, Julia, my dear, you will correctme.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I believe I was,’ said Mrs Wititterly, in a faint voice.</p> 
<p>　　As there appeared to be some doubt in the mind of his patronhow he could best join in this conversation, the indefatigable MrPyke threw himself into the breach, and, by way of sayingsomething to the point, inquired—with reference to the aforesaidmedicine—whether it was nice.</p> 
<p>　　‘No, sir, it was not. It had not even that recommendation,’ saidMr W.</p> 
<p>　　‘Mrs Wititterly is quite a martyr,’ observed Pyke, with acomplimentary bow.</p> 
<p>　　‘I think I am,’ said Mrs Wititterly, smiling.</p> 
<p>　　‘I think you are, my dear Julia,’ replied her husband, in a tone which seemed to say that he was not vain, but still must insistupon their privileges. ‘If anybody, my lord,’ added Mr Wititterly,wheeling round to the nobleman, ‘will produce to me a greatermartyr than Mrs Wititterly, all I can say is, that I shall be glad tosee that martyr, whether male or female—that’s all, my lord.’</p> 
<p>　　Pyke and Pluck promptly remarked that certainly nothingcould be fairer than that; and the call having been by this timeprotracted to a very great length, they obeyed Sir Mulberry’s look,and rose to go. This brought Sir Mulberry himself and LordVerisopht on their legs also. Many protestations of friendship, andexpressions anticipative of the pleasure which must inevitablyflow from so happy an acquaintance, were exchanged, and thevisitors departed, with renewed assurances that at all times andseasons the mansion of the Wititterlys would be honoured byreceiving them beneath its roof.</p> 
<p>　　That they came at all times and seasons—that they dined thereone day, supped the next, dined again on the next, and wereconstantly to and fro on all—that they made parties to visit publicplaces, and met by accident at lounges—that upon all theseoccasions Miss Nickleby was exposed to the constant andunremitting persecution of Sir Mulberry Hawk, who now began tofeel his character, even in the estimation of his two dependants,involved in the successful reduction of her pride—that she had nointervals of peace or rest, except at those hours when she could sitin her solitary room, and weep over the trials of the day—all thesewere consequences naturally flowing from the well-laid plans ofSir Mulberry, and their able execution by the auxiliaries, Pyke andPluck.</p> 
<p>　　And thus for a fortnight matters went on. That any but the weakest and silliest of people could have seen in one interviewthat Lord Verisopht, though he was a lord, and Sir MulberryHawk, though he was a baronet, were not persons accustomed tobe the best possible companions, and were certainly not calculatedby habits, manners, tastes, or conversation, to shine with any verygreat lustre in the society of ladies, need scarcely be remarked.</p> 
<p>　　But with Mrs Wititterly the two titles were all sufficient;coarseness became humour, vulgarity softened itself down into themost charming eccentricity; insolence took the guise of an easyabsence of reserve, attainable only by those who had had the goodfortune to mix with high folks.</p> 
<p>　　If the mistress put such a construction upon the behaviour ofher new friends, what could the companion urge against them? Ifthey accustomed themselves to very little restraint before the ladyof the house, with how much more freedom could they address herpaid dependent! Nor was even this the worst. As the odious SirMulberry Hawk attached himself to Kate with less and less ofdisguise, Mrs Wititterly began to grow jealous of the superiorattractions of Miss Nickleby. If this feeling had led to herbanishment from the drawing-room when such company wasthere, Kate would have been only too happy and willing that itshould have existed, but unfortunately for her she possessed thatnative grace and true gentility of manner, and those thousandnameless accomplishments which give to female society itsgreatest charm; if these be valuable anywhere, they wereespecially so where the lady of the house was a mere animateddoll. The consequence was, that Kate had the double mortificationof being an indispensable part of the circle when Sir Mulberry andhis friends were there, and of being exposed, on that very account, to all Mrs Wititterly’s ill-humours and caprices when they weregone. She became utterly and completely miserable.</p> 
<p>　　Mrs Wititterly had never thrown off the mask with regard to SirMulberry, but when she was more than usually out of temper,attributed the circumstance, as ladies sometimes do, to nervousindisposition. However, as the dreadful idea that Lord Verisophtalso was somewhat taken with Kate, and that she, Mrs Wititterly,was quite a secondary person, dawned upon that lady’s mind andgradually developed itself, she became possessed with a largequantity of highly proper and most virtuous indignation, and felt ither duty, as a married lady and a moral member of society, tomention the circumstance to ‘the young person’ without delay.</p> 
<p>　　Accordingly Mrs Wititterly broke ground next morning, duringa pause in the novel-reading.</p> 
<p>　　‘Miss Nickleby,’ said Mrs Wititterly, ‘I wish to speak to you verygravely. I am sorry to have to do it, upon my word I am very sorry,but you leave me no alternative, Miss Nickleby.’ Here MrsWititterly tossed her head—not passionately, only virtuously—andremarked, with some appearance of excitement, that she fearedthat palpitation of the heart was coming on again.</p> 
<p>　　‘Your behaviour, Miss Nickleby,’ resumed the lady, ‘is very farfrom pleasing me—very far. I am very anxious indeed that youshould do well, but you may depend upon it, Miss Nickleby, youwill not, if you go on as you do.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Ma’am!’ exclaimed Kate, proudly.</p> 
<p>　　‘Don’t agitate me by speaking in that way, Miss Nickleby, don’t,’</p> 
<p>　　said Mrs Wititterly, with some violence, ‘or you’ll compel me toring the bell.’</p> 
<p>　　Kate looked at her, but said nothing.</p> 
<p>　　 ‘You needn’t suppose,’ resumed Mrs Wititterly, ‘that yourlooking at me in that way, Miss Nickleby, will prevent my sayingwhat I am going to say, which I feel to be a religious duty. Youneedn’t direct your glances towards me,’ said Mrs Wititterly, witha sudden burst of spite; ‘I am not Sir Mulberry, no, nor LordFrederick Verisopht, Miss Nickleby, nor am I Mr Pyke, nor MrPluck either.’</p> 
<p>　　Kate looked at her again, but less steadily than before; andresting her elbow on the table, covered her eyes with her hand.</p> 
<p>　　‘If such things had been done when I was a young girl,’ said MrsWititterly (this, by the way, must have been some little timebefore), ‘I don’t suppose anybody would have believed it.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I don’t think they would,’ murmured Kate. ‘I do not thinkanybody would believe, without actually knowing it, what I seemdoomed to undergo!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Don’t talk to me of being doomed to undergo, Miss Nickleby, ifyou please,’ said Mrs Wititterly, with a shrillness of tone quitesurprising in so great an invalid. ‘I will not be answered, MissNickleby. I am not accustomed to be answered, nor will I permit itfor an instant. Do you hear?’ she added, waiting with someapparent inconsistency for an answer.</p> 
<p>　　‘I do hear you, ma’am,’ replied Kate, ‘with surprise—withgreater surprise than I can express.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I have always considered you a particularly well-behavedyoung person for your station in life,’ said Mrs Wititterly; ‘and asyou are a person of healthy appearance, and neat in your dressand so forth, I have taken an interest in you, as I do still,considering that I owe a sort of duty to that respectable old female,your mother. For these reasons, Miss Nickleby, I must tell you once for all, and begging you to mind what I say, that I must insistupon your immediately altering your very forward behaviour tothe gentleman who visit at this house. It really is not becoming,’</p> 
<p>　　said Mrs Wititterly, closing her chaste eyes as she spoke; ‘it isimproper—quite improper.”</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh!’ cried Kate, looking upwards and clasping her hands; ‘isnot this, is not this, too cruel, too hard to bear! Is it not enoughthat I should have suffered as I have, night and day; that I shouldalmost have sunk in my own estimation from very shame of havingbeen brought into contact with such people; but must I also beexposed to this unjust and most unfounded charge!’</p> 
<p>　　‘You will have the goodness to recollect, Miss Nickleby,’ saidMrs Wititterly, ‘that when you use such terms as “unjust”, and“unfounded”, you charge me, in effect, with stating that which isuntrue.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I do,’ said Kate with honest indignation. ‘Whether you makethis accusation of yourself, or at the prompting of others, is alike tome. I say it is vilely, grossly, wilfully untrue. Is it possible!’ criedKate, ‘that anyone of my own sex can have sat by, and not haveseen the misery these men have caused me? Is it possible that you,ma’am, can have been present, and failed to mark the insultingfreedom that their every look bespoke? Is it possible that you canhave avoided seeing, that these libertines, in their utter disrespectfor you, and utter disregard of all gentlemanly behaviour, andalmost of decency, have had but one object in introducingthemselves here, and that the furtherance of their designs upon afriendless, helpless girl, who, without this humiliating confession,might have hoped to receive from one so much her seniorsomething like womanly aid and sympathy? I do not—I cannot believe it!’</p> 
<p>　　If poor Kate had possessed the slightest knowledge of theworld, she certainly would not have ventured, even in theexcitement into which she had been lashed, upon such aninjudicious speech as this. Its effect was precisely what a moreexperienced observer would have foreseen. Mrs Wititterlyreceived the attack upon her veracity with exemplary calmness,and listened with the most heroic fortitude to Kate’s account ofher own sufferings. But allusion being made to her being held indisregard by the gentlemen, she evinced violent emotion, and thisblow was no sooner followed up by the remark concerning herseniority, than she fell back upon the sofa, uttering dismalscreams.</p> 
<p>　　‘What is the matter?’ cried Mr Wititterly, bouncing into theroom. ‘Heavens, what do I see? Julia! Julia! look up, my life, lookup!’</p> 
<p>　　But Julia looked down most perseveringly, and screamed stilllouder; so Mr Wititterly rang the bell, and danced in a frenziedmanner round the sofa on which Mrs Wititterly lay; utteringperpetual cries for Sir Tumley Snuffim, and never once leaving offto ask for any explanation of the scene before him.</p> 
<p>　　‘Run for Sir Tumley,’ cried Mr Wititterly, menacing the pagewith both fists. ‘I knew it, Miss Nickleby,’ he said, looking roundwith an air of melancholy triumph, ‘that society has been too muchfor her. This is all soul, you know, every bit of it.’ With thisassurance Mr Wititterly took up the prostrate form of MrsWititterly, and carried her bodily off to bed.</p> 
<p>　　Kate waited until Sir Tumley Snuffim had paid his visit andlooked in with a report, that, through the special interposition of a merciful Providence (thus spake Sir Tumley), Mrs Wititterly hadgone to sleep. She then hastily attired herself for walking, andleaving word that she should return within a couple of hours,hurried away towards her uncle’s house.</p> 
<p>　　It had been a good day with Ralph Nickleby—quite a lucky day;and as he walked to and fro in his little back-room with his handsclasped behind him, adding up in his own mind all the sums thathad been, or would be, netted from the business done sincemorning, his mouth was drawn into a hard stern smile; while thefirmness of the lines and curves that made it up, as well as thecunning glance of his cold, bright eye, seemed to tell, that if anyresolution or cunning would increase the profits, they would notfail to be excited for the purpose.</p> 
<p>　　‘Very good!’ said Ralph, in allusion, no doubt, to someproceeding of the day. ‘He defies the usurer, does he? Well, weshall see. “Honesty is the best policy,” is it? We’ll try that too.’</p> 
<p>　　He stopped, and then walked on again.</p> 
<p>　　‘He is content,’ said Ralph, relaxing into a smile, ‘to set hisknown character and conduct against the power of money—dross,as he calls it. Why, what a dull blockhead this fellow must be!</p> 
<p>　　Dross to, dross! Who’s that?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Me,’ said Newman Noggs, looking in. ‘Your niece.’</p> 
<p>　　‘What of her?’ asked Ralph sharply.</p> 
<p>　　‘She’s here.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Here!’</p> 
<p>　　Newman jerked his head towards his little room, to signify thatshe was waiting there.</p> 
<p>　　‘What does she want?’ asked Ralph.</p> 
<p>　　‘I don’t know,’ rejoined Newman. ‘Shall I ask?’ he added quickly.</p> 
<p>　　‘No,’ replied Ralph. ‘Show her in! Stay.’ He hastily put away apadlocked cash-box that was on the table, and substituted in itsstead an empty purse. ‘There,’ said Ralph. ‘Now she may come in.’</p> 
<p>　　Newman, with a grim smile at this manoeuvre, beckoned theyoung lady to advance, and having placed a chair for her, retired;looking stealthily over his shoulder at Ralph as he limped slowlyout.</p> 
<p>　　‘Well,’ said Ralph, roughly enough; but still with somethingmore of kindness in his manner than he would have exhibitedtowards anybody else. ‘Well, my—dear. What now?’</p> 
<p>　　Kate raised her eyes, which were filled with tears; and with aneffort to master her emotion strove to speak, but in vain. Sodrooping her head again, she remained silent. Her face washidden from his view, but Ralph could see that she was weeping.</p> 
<p>　　‘I can guess the cause of this!’ thought Ralph, after looking ather for some time in silence. ‘I can—I can—guess the cause. Well!</p> 
<p>　　Well!’ thought Ralph—for the moment quite disconcerted, as hewatched the anguish of his beautiful niece. ‘Where is the harm?</p> 
<p>　　only a few tears; and it’s an excellent lesson for her, an excellentlesson.’</p> 
<p>　　‘What is the matter?’ asked Ralph, drawing a chair opposite,and sitting down.</p> 
<p>　　He was rather taken aback by the sudden firmness with whichKate looked up and answered him.</p> 
<p>　　‘The matter which brings me to you, sir,’ she said, ‘is one whichshould call the blood up into your cheeks, and make you burn tohear, as it does me to tell. I have been wronged; my feelings havebeen outraged, insulted, wounded past all healing, and by your friends.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Friends!’ cried Ralph, sternly. ‘I have no friends, girl.’</p> 
<p>　　‘By the men I saw here, then,’ returned Kate, quickly. ‘If theywere no friends of yours, and you knew what they were,—oh, themore shame on you, uncle, for bringing me among them. To havesubjected me to what I was exposed to here, through anymisplaced confidence or imperfect knowledge of your guests,would have required some strong excuse; but if you did it—as Inow believe you did—knowing them well, it was most dastardlyand cruel.’</p> 
<p>　　Ralph drew back in utter amazement at this plain speaking,and regarded Kate with the sternest look. But she met his gazeproudly and firmly, and although her face was very pale, it lookedmore noble and handsome, lighted up as it was, than it had everappeared before.</p> 
<p>　　‘There is some of that boy’s blood in you, I see,’ said Ralph,speaking in his harshest tones, as something in the flashing eyereminded him of Nicholas at their last meeting.</p> 
<p>　　‘I hope there is!’ replied Kate. ‘I should be proud to know it. Iam young, uncle, and all the difficulties and miseries of mysituation have kept it down, but I have been roused today beyondall endurance, and come what may, I will not, as I am yourbrother’s child, bear these insults longer.’</p> 
<p>　　‘What insults, girl?’ demanded Ralph, sharply.</p> 
<p>　　‘Remember what took place here, and ask yourself,’ repliedKate, colouring deeply. ‘Uncle, you must—I am sure you will—release me from such vile and degrading companionship as I amexposed to now. I do not mean,’ said Kate, hurrying to the oldman, and laying her arm upon his shoulder; ‘I do not mean to be angry and violent—I beg your pardon if I have seemed so, dearuncle,—but you do not know what I have suffered, you do notindeed. You cannot tell what the heart of a young girl is—I have noright to expect you should; but when I tell you that I am wretched,and that my heart is breaking, I am sure you will help me. I amsure, I am sure you will!’</p> 
<p>　　Ralph looked at her for an instant; then turned away his head,and beat his foot nervously upon the ground.</p> 
<p>　　‘I have gone on day after day,’ said Kate, bending over him, andtimidly placing her little hand in his, ‘in the hope that thispersecution would cease; I have gone on day after day, compelledto assume the appearance of cheerfulness, when I was mostunhappy. I have had no counsellor, no adviser, no one to protectme. Mama supposes that these are honourable men, rich anddistinguished, and how can I—how can I undeceive her—whenshe is so happy in these little delusions, which are the onlyhappiness she has? The lady with whom you placed me, is not theperson to whom I could confide matters of so much delicacy, and Ihave come at last to you, the only friend I have at hand—almostthe only friend I have at all—to entreat and implore you to assistme.’</p> 
<p>　　‘How can I assist you, child?’ said Ralph, rising from his chair,and pacing up and down the room in his old attitude.</p> 
<p>　　‘You have influence with one of these men, I know,’ rejoinedKate, emphatically. ‘Would not a word from you induce them todesist from this unmanly course?’</p> 
<p>　　‘No,’ said Ralph, suddenly turning; ‘at least—that—I can’t sayit, if it would.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Can’t say it!’</p> 
<p>　　 ‘No,’ said Ralph, coming to a dead stop, and clasping his handsmore tightly behind him. ‘I can’t say it.’</p> 
<p>　　Kate fell back a step or two, and looked at him, as if in doubtwhether she had heard aright.</p> 
<p>　　‘We are connected in business,’ said Ralph, poising himselfalternately on his toes and heels, and looking coolly in his niece’sface, ‘in business, and I can’t afford to offend them. What is it afterall? We have all our trials, and this is one of yours. Some girlswould be proud to have such gallants at their feet.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Proud!’ cried Kate.</p> 
<p>　　‘I don’t say,’ rejoined Ralph, raising his forefinger, ‘but that youdo right to despise them; no, you show your good sense in that, asindeed I knew from the first you would. Well. In all other respectsyou are comfortably bestowed. It’s not much to bear. If this younglord does dog your footsteps, and whisper his drivelling inanitiesin your ears, what of it? It’s a dishonourable passion. So be it; itwon’t last long. Some other novelty will spring up one day, andyou will be released. In the mean time—’</p> 
<p>　　‘In the mean time,’ interrupted Kate, with becoming pride andindignation, ‘I am to be the scorn of my own sex, and the toy of theother; justly condemned by all women of right feeling, anddespised by all honest and honourable men; sunken in my ownesteem, and degraded in every eye that looks upon me. No, not if Iwork my fingers to the bone, not if I am driven to the roughest andhardest labour. Do not mistake me. I will not disgrace yourrecommendation. I will remain in the house in which it placed me,until I am entitled to leave it by the terms of my engagement;though, mind, I see these men no more. When I quit it, I will hidemyself from them and you, and, striving to support my mother by hard service, I will live, at least, in peace, and trust in God to helpme.’</p> 
<p>　　With these words, she waved her hand, and quitted the room,leaving Ralph Nickleby motionless as a statue.</p> 
<p>　　The surprise with which Kate, as she closed the room-door,beheld, close beside it, Newman Noggs standing bolt upright in alittle niche in the wall like some scarecrow or Guy Faux laid up inwinter quarters, almost occasioned her to call aloud. But, Newmanlaying his finger upon his lips, she had the presence of mind torefrain.</p> 
<p>　　‘Don’t,’ said Newman, gliding out of his recess, andaccompanying her across the hall. ‘Don’t cry, don’t cry.’ Two verylarge tears, by-the-bye, were running down Newman’s face as hespoke.</p> 
<p>　　‘I see how it is,’ said poor Noggs, drawing from his pocket whatseemed to be a very old duster, and wiping Kate’s eyes with it, asgently as if she were an infant. ‘You’re giving way now. Yes, yes,very good; that’s right, I like that. It was right not to give waybefore him. Yes, yes! Ha, ha, ha! Oh, yes. Poor thing!’</p> 
<p>　　With these disjointed exclamations, Newman wiped his owneyes with the afore-mentioned duster, and, limping to the street-door, opened it to let her out.</p> 
<p>　　‘Don’t cry any more,’ whispered Newman. ‘I shall see you soon.</p> 
<p>　　Ha! ha! ha! And so shall somebody else too. Yes, yes. Ho! ho!’</p> 
<p>　　‘God bless you,’ answered Kate, hurrying out, ‘God bless you.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Same to you,’ rejoined Newman, opening the door again a littleway to say so. ‘Ha, ha, ha! Ho! ho! ho!’</p> 
<p>　　And Newman Noggs opened the door once again to nodcheerfully, and laugh—and shut it, to shake his head mournfully, and cry.</p> 
<p>　　Ralph remained in the same attitude till he heard the noise ofthe closing door, when he shrugged his shoulders, and after a fewturns about the room—hasty at first, but gradually becomingslower, as he relapsed into himself—sat down before his desk.</p> 
<p>　　It is one of those problems of human nature, which may benoted down, but not solved;—although Ralph felt no remorse atthat moment for his conduct towards the innocent, true-heartedgirl; although his libertine clients had done precisely what he hadexpected, precisely what he most wished, and precisely whatwould tend most to his advantage, still he hated them for doing it,from the very bottom of his soul.</p> 
<p>　　‘Ugh!’ said Ralph, scowling round, and shaking his clenchedhand as the faces of the two profligates rose up before his mind;‘you shall pay for this. Oh! you shall pay for this!’</p> 
<p>　　As the usurer turned for consolation to his books and papers, aperformance was going on outside his office door, which wouldhave occasioned him no small surprise, if he could by any meanshave become acquainted with it.</p> 
<p>　　Newman Noggs was the sole actor. He stood at a little distancefrom the door, with his face towards it; and with the sleeves of hiscoat turned back at the wrists, was occupied in bestowing the mostvigorous, scientific, and straightforward blows upon the empty air.</p> 
<p>　　At first sight, this would have appeared merely a wiseprecaution in a man of sedentary habits, with the view of openingthe chest and strengthening the muscles of the arms. But theintense eagerness and joy depicted in the face of Newman Noggs,which was suffused with perspiration; the surprising energy withwhich he directed a constant succession of blows towards a particular panel about five feet eight from the ground, and stillworked away in the most untiring and persevering manner, wouldhave sufficiently explained to the attentive observer, that hisimagination was thrashing, to within an inch of his life, his body’smost active employer, Mr Ralph Nickleby.</p>
