<p>　　The first care of Nicholas, next morning, was, to look aftersome room in which, until better times dawned upon him,he could contrive to exist, without trenching upon thehospitality of Newman Noggs, who would have slept upon thestairs with pleasure, so that his young friend was accommodated.</p> 
<p>　　The vacant apartment to which the bill in the parlour windowbore reference, appeared, on inquiry, to be a small back-room onthe second floor, reclaimed from the leads, and overlooking a sootbespeckled prospect of tiles and chimney-pots. For the letting ofthis portion of the house from week to week, on reasonable terms,the parlour lodger was empowered to treat; he being deputed bythe landlord to dispose of the rooms as they became vacant, and tokeep a sharp look-out that the lodgers didn’t run away. As a meansof securing the punctual discharge of which last service he waspermitted to live rent-free, lest he should at any time be temptedto run away himself.</p> 
<p>　　Of this chamber, Nicholas became the tenant; and having hireda few common articles of furniture from a neighbouring broker,and paid the first week’s hire in advance, out of a small fundraised by the conversion of some spare clothes into ready money,he sat himself down to ruminate upon his prospects, which, likethe prospect outside his window, were sufficiently confined and dingy. As they by no means improved on better acquaintance, andas familiarity breeds contempt, he resolved to banish them fromhis thoughts by dint of hard walking. So, taking up his hat, andleaving poor Smike to arrange and rearrange the room with asmuch delight as if it had been the costliest palace, he betookhimself to the streets, and mingled with the crowd which throngedthem.</p> 
<p>　　Although a man may lose a sense of his own importance whenhe is a mere unit among a busy throng, all utterly regardless ofhim, it by no means follows that he can dispossess himself, withequal facility, of a very strong sense of the importance andmagnitude of his cares. The unhappy state of his own affairs wasthe one idea which occupied the brain of Nicholas, walk as fast ashe would; and when he tried to dislodge it by speculating on thesituation and prospects of the people who surrounded him, hecaught himself, in a few seconds, contrasting their condition withhis own, and gliding almost imperceptibly back into his old train ofthought again.</p> 
<p>　　Occupied in these reflections, as he was making his way alongone of the great public thoroughfares of London, he chanced toraise his eyes to a blue board, whereon was inscribed, incharacters of gold, ‘General Agency Office; for places andsituations of all kinds inquire within.’ It was a shop-front, fitted upwith a gauze blind and an inner door; and in the window hung along and tempting array of written placards, announcing vacantplaces of every grade, from a secretary’s to a foot-boy’s.</p> 
<p>　　Nicholas halted, instinctively, before this temple of promise,and ran his eye over the capital-text openings in life which were soprofusely displayed. When he had completed his survey he walked on a little way, and then back, and then on again; at length, afterpausing irresolutely several times before the door of the GeneralAgency Office, he made up his mind, and stepped in.</p> 
<p>　　He found himself in a little floor-clothed room, with a high deskrailed off in one corner, behind which sat a lean youth withcunning eyes and a protruding chin, whose performances incapital-text darkened the window. He had a thick ledger lyingopen before him, and with the fingers of his right hand insertedbetween the leaves, and his eyes fixed on a very fat old lady in amob-cap—evidently the proprietress of the establishment—whowas airing herself at the fire, seemed to be only waiting herdirections to refer to some entries contained within its rustyclasps.</p> 
<p>　　As there was a board outside, which acquainted the public thatservants-of-all-work were perpetually in waiting to be hired fromten till four, Nicholas knew at once that some half-dozen strongyoung women, each with pattens and an umbrella, who weresitting upon a form in one corner, were in attendance for thatpurpose: especially as the poor things looked anxious and weary.</p> 
<p>　　He was not quite so certain of the callings and stations of twosmart young ladies who were in conversation with the fat ladybefore the fire, until—having sat himself down in a corner, andremarked that he would wait until the other customers had beenserved—the fat lady resumed the dialogue which his entrance hadinterrupted.</p> 
<p>　　‘Cook, Tom,’ said the fat lady, still airing herself as aforesaid.</p> 
<p>　　‘Cook,’ said Tom, turning over some leaves of the ledger. ‘Well!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Read out an easy place or two,’ said the fat lady.</p> 
<p>　　‘Pick out very light ones, if you please, young man,’ interposed a genteel female, in shepherd’s-plaid boots, who appeared to bethe client.</p> 
<p>　　‘“Mrs Marker,”’ said Tom, reading, ‘“Russell Place, RussellSquare; offers eighteen guineas; tea and sugar found. Two infamily, and see very little company. Five servants kept. No man.</p> 
<p>　　No followers.”’</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh Lor!’ tittered the client. ‘That won’t do. Read another,young man, will you?’</p> 
<p>　　‘“Mrs Wrymug,”’ said Tom, ‘“Pleasant Place, Finsbury. Wages,twelve guineas. No tea, no sugar. Serious family—”’</p> 
<p>　　‘Ah! you needn’t mind reading that,’ interrupted the client.</p> 
<p>　　‘“Three serious footmen,”’ said Tom, impressively.</p> 
<p>　　‘Three? did you say?’ asked the client in an altered tone.</p> 
<p>　　‘Three serious footmen,’ replied Tom. ‘“Cook, housemaid, andnursemaid; each female servant required to join the Little BethelCongregation three times every Sunday—with a serious footman.</p> 
<p>　　If the cook is more serious than the footman, she will be expectedto improve the footman; if the footman is more serious than thecook, he will be expected to improve the cook.”’</p> 
<p>　　‘I’ll take the address of that place,’ said the client; ‘I don’t knowbut what it mightn’t suit me pretty well.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Here’s another,’ remarked Tom, turning over the leaves.</p> 
<p>　　‘“Family of Mr Gallanbile, MP. Fifteen guineas, tea and sugar, andservants allowed to see male cousins, if godly. Note. Cold dinner inthe kitchen on the Sabbath, Mr Gallanbile being devoted to theObservance question. No victuals whatever cooked on the Lord’sDay, with the exception of dinner for Mr and Mrs Gallanbile,which, being a work of piety and necessity, is exempted. MrGallanbile dines late on the day of rest, in order to prevent the sinfulness of the cook’s dressing herself.”’</p> 
<p>　　‘I don’t think that’ll answer as well as the other,’ said the client,after a little whispering with her friend. ‘I’ll take the otherdirection, if you please, young man. I can but come back again, if itdon’t do.’</p> 
<p>　　Tom made out the address, as requested, and the genteel client,having satisfied the fat lady with a small fee, meanwhile, wentaway accompanied by her friend.</p> 
<p>　　As Nicholas opened his mouth, to request the young man toturn to letter S, and let him know what secretaryships remainedundisposed of, there came into the office an applicant, in whosefavour he immediately retired, and whose appearance bothsurprised and interested him.</p> 
<p>　　This was a young lady who could be scarcely eighteen, of veryslight and delicate figure, but exquisitely shaped, who, walkingtimidly up to the desk, made an inquiry, in a very low tone ofvoice, relative to some situation as governess, or companion to alady. She raised her veil, for an instant, while she preferred theinquiry, and disclosed a countenance of most uncommon beauty,though shaded by a cloud of sadness, which, in one so young, wasdoubly remarkable. Having received a card of reference to someperson on the books, she made the usual acknowledgment, andglided away.</p> 
<p>　　She was neatly, but very quietly attired; so much so, indeed,that it seemed as though her dress, if it had been worn by one whoimparted fewer graces of her own to it, might have looked poorand shabby. Her attendant—for she had one—was a red-faced,round-eyed, slovenly girl, who, from a certain roughness about thebare arms that peeped from under her draggled shawl, and the half-washed-out traces of smut and blacklead which tattooed hercountenance, was clearly of a kin with the servants-of-all-work onthe form: between whom and herself there had passed variousgrins and glances, indicative of the freemasonry of the craft.</p> 
<p>　　This girl followed her mistress; and, before Nicholas hadrecovered from the first effects of his surprise and admiration, theyoung lady was gone. It is not a matter of such complete and utterimprobability as some sober people may think, that he would havefollowed them out, had he not been restrained by what passedbetween the fat lady and her book-keeper.</p> 
<p>　　‘When is she coming again, Tom?’ asked the fat lady.</p> 
<p>　　‘Tomorrow morning,’ replied Tom, mending his pen.</p> 
<p>　　‘Where have you sent her to?’ asked the fat lady.</p> 
<p>　　‘Mrs Clark’s,’ replied Tom.</p> 
<p>　　‘She’ll have a nice life of it, if she goes there,’ observed the fatlady, taking a pinch of snuff from a tin box.</p> 
<p>　　Tom made no other reply than thrusting his tongue into hischeek, and pointing the feather of his pen towards Nicholas—reminders which elicited from the fat lady an inquiry, of ‘Now, sir,what can we do for you?’</p> 
<p>　　Nicholas briefly replied, that he wanted to know whether therewas any such post to be had, as secretary or amanuensis to agentleman.</p> 
<p>　　‘Any such!’ rejoined the mistress; ‘a-dozen-such. An’t there,Tom?’</p> 
<p>　　‘I should think so,’ answered that young gentleman; and as hesaid it, he winked towards Nicholas, with a degree of familiaritywhich he, no doubt, intended for a rather flattering compliment,but with which Nicholas was most ungratefully disgusted.</p> 
<p>　　 Upon reference to the book, it appeared that the dozensecretaryships had dwindled down to one. Mr Gregsbury, thegreat member of parliament, of Manchester Buildings,Westminster, wanted a young man, to keep his papers andcorrespondence in order; and Nicholas was exactly the sort ofyoung man that Mr Gregsbury wanted.</p> 
<p>　　‘I don’t know what the terms are, as he said he’d settle themhimself with the party,’ observed the fat lady; ‘but they must bepretty good ones, because he’s a member of parliament.’</p> 
<p>　　Inexperienced as he was, Nicholas did not feel quite assured ofthe force of this reasoning, or the justice of this conclusion; butwithout troubling himself to question it, he took down the address,and resolved to wait upon Mr Gregsbury without delay.</p> 
<p>　　‘I don’t know what the number is,’ said Tom; ‘but ManchesterBuildings isn’t a large place; and if the worst comes to the worst itwon’t take you very long to knock at all the doors on both sides ofthe way till you find him out. I say, what a good-looking gal thatwas, wasn’t she?’</p> 
<p>　　‘What girl?’ demanded Nicholas, sternly.</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh yes. I know—what gal, eh?’ whispered Tom, shutting oneeye, and cocking his chin in the air. ‘You didn’t see her, youdidn’t—I say, don’t you wish you was me, when she comestomorrow morning?’</p> 
<p>　　Nicholas looked at the ugly clerk, as if he had a mind to rewardhis admiration of the young lady by beating the ledger about hisears, but he refrained, and strode haughtily out of the office;setting at defiance, in his indignation, those ancient laws ofchivalry, which not only made it proper and lawful for all goodknights to hear the praise of the ladies to whom they were devoted, but rendered it incumbent upon them to roam about theworld, and knock at head all such matter-of-fact and un-poeticalcharacters, as declined to exalt, above all the earth, damsels whomthey had never chanced to look upon or hear of—as if that wereany excuse!</p> 
<p>　　Thinking no longer of his own misfortunes, but wondering whatcould be those of the beautiful girl he had seen, Nicholas, withmany wrong turns, and many inquiries, and almost as manymisdirections, bent his steps towards the place whither he hadbeen directed.</p> 
<p>　　Within the precincts of the ancient city of Westminster, andwithin half a quarter of a mile of its ancient sanctuary, is a narrowand dirty region, the sanctuary of the smaller members ofParliament in modern days. It is all comprised in one street ofgloomy lodging-houses, from whose windows, in vacation-time,there frown long melancholy rows of bills, which say, as plainly asdid the countenances of their occupiers, ranged on ministerial andopposition benches in the session which slumbers with its fathers,‘To Let’, ‘To Let’. In busier periods of the year these billsdisappear, and the houses swarm with legislators. There arelegislators in the parlours, in the first floor, in the second, in thethird, in the garrets; the small apartments reek with the breath ofdeputations and delegates. In damp weather, the place is renderedclose, by the steams of moist acts of parliament and frouzypetitions; general postmen grow faint as they enter its infectedlimits, and shabby figures in quest of franks, flit restlessly to andfro like the troubled ghosts of Complete Letter-writers departed.</p> 
<p>　　This is Manchester Buildings; and here, at all hours of the night,may be heard the rattling of latch-keys in their respective keyholes: with now and then—when a gust of wind sweepingacross the water which washes the Buildings’ feet, impels thesound towards its entrance—the weak, shrill voice of some youngmember practising tomorrow’s speech. All the livelong day, thereis a grinding of organs and clashing and clanging of little boxes ofmusic; for Manchester Buildings is an eel-pot, which has no outletbut its awkward mouth—a case-bottle which has no thoroughfare,and a short and narrow neck—and in this respect it may be typicalof the fate of some few among its more adventurous residents,who, after wriggling themselves into Parliament by violent effortsand contortions, find that it, too, is no thoroughfare for them; that,like Manchester Buildings, it leads to nothing beyond itself; andthat they are fain at last to back out, no wiser, no richer, not onewhit more famous, than they went in.</p> 
<p>　　Into Manchester Buildings Nicholas turned, with the address ofthe great Mr Gregsbury in his hand. As there was a stream ofpeople pouring into a shabby house not far from the entrance, hewaited until they had made their way in, and then making up tothe servant, ventured to inquire if he knew where Mr Gregsburylived.</p> 
<p>　　The servant was a very pale, shabby boy, who looked as if hehad slept underground from his infancy, as very likely he had. ‘MrGregsbury?’ said he; ‘Mr Gregsbury lodges here. It’s all right.</p> 
<p>　　Come in!’</p> 
<p>　　Nicholas thought he might as well get in while he could, so inhe walked; and he had no sooner done so, than the boy shut thedoor, and made off.</p> 
<p>　　This was odd enough: but what was more embarrassing was,that all along the passage, and all along the narrow stairs, blocking up the window, and making the dark entry darker still, was aconfused crowd of persons with great importance depicted in theirlooks; who were, to all appearance, waiting in silent expectation ofsome coming event. From time to time, one man would whisperhis neighbour, or a little group would whisper together, and thenthe whisperers would nod fiercely to each other, or give theirheads a relentless shake, as if they were bent upon doingsomething very desperate, and were determined not to be put off,whatever happened.</p> 
<p>　　As a few minutes elapsed without anything occurring to explainthis phenomenon, and as he felt his own position a peculiarlyuncomfortable one, Nicholas was on the point of seeking someinformation from the man next him, when a sudden move wasvisible on the stairs, and a voice was heard to cry, ‘Now,gentleman, have the goodness to walk up!’</p> 
<p>　　So far from walking up, the gentlemen on the stairs began towalk down with great alacrity, and to entreat, with extraordinarypoliteness, that the gentlemen nearest the street would go first;the gentlemen nearest the street retorted, with equal courtesy,that they couldn’t think of such a thing on any account; but theydid it, without thinking of it, inasmuch as the other gentlemenpressing some half-dozen (among whom was Nicholas) forward,and closing up behind, pushed them, not merely up the stairs, butinto the very sitting-room of Mr Gregsbury, which they were thuscompelled to enter with most unseemly precipitation, and withoutthe means of retreat; the press behind them, more than filling theapartment.</p> 
<p>　　‘Gentlemen,’ said Mr Gregsbury, ‘you are welcome. I amrejoiced to see you.’</p> 
<p>　　 For a gentleman who was rejoiced to see a body of visitors, MrGregsbury looked as uncomfortable as might be; but perhaps thiswas occasioned by senatorial gravity, and a statesmanlike habit ofkeeping his feelings under control. He was a tough, burly, thickheaded gentleman, with a loud voice, a pompous manner, atolerable command of sentences with no meaning in them, and, inshort, every requisite for a very good member indeed.</p> 
<p>　　‘Now, gentlemen,’ said Mr Gregsbury, tossing a great bundle ofpapers into a wicker basket at his feet, and throwing himself backin his chair with his arms over the elbows, ‘you are dissatisfiedwith my conduct, I see by the newspapers.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, Mr Gregsbury, we are,’ said a plump old gentleman in aviolent heat, bursting out of the throng, and planting himself inthe front.</p> 
<p>　　‘Do my eyes deceive me,’ said Mr Gregsbury, looking towardsthe speaker, ‘or is that my old friend Pugstyles?’</p> 
<p>　　‘I am that man, and no other, sir,’ replied the plump oldgentleman.</p> 
<p>　　‘Give me your hand, my worthy friend,’ said Mr Gregsbury.</p> 
<p>　　‘Pugstyles, my dear friend, I am very sorry to see you here.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I am very sorry to be here, sir,’ said Mr Pugstyles; ‘but yourconduct, Mr Gregsbury, has rendered this deputation from yourconstituents imperatively necessary.’</p> 
<p>　　‘My conduct, Pugstyles,’ said Mr Gregsbury, looking roundupon the deputation with gracious magnanimity—’ my conducthas been, and ever will be, regulated by a sincere regard for thetrue and real interests of this great and happy country. Whether Ilook at home, or abroad; whether I behold the peaceful industriouscommunities of our island home: her rivers covered with steamboats, her roads with locomotives, her streets with cabs, herskies with balloons of a power and magnitude hitherto unknownin the history of aeronautics in this or any other nation—I say,whether I look merely at home, or, stretching my eyes farther,contemplate the boundless prospect of conquest and possession—achieved by British perseverance and British valour—which isoutspread before me, I clasp my hands, and turning my eyes to thebroad expanse above my head, exclaim, “Thank Heaven, I am aBriton!”’</p> 
<p>　　The time had been, when this burst of enthusiasm would havebeen cheered to the very echo; but now, the deputation received itwith chilling coldness. The general impression seemed to be, thatas an explanation of Mr Gregsbury’s political conduct, it did notenter quite enough into detail; and one gentleman in the rear didnot scruple to remark aloud, that, for his purpose, it savouredrather too much of a ‘gammon’ tendency.</p> 
<p>　　‘The meaning of that term—gammon,’ said Mr Gregsbury, ‘isunknown to me. If it means that I grow a little too fervid, orperhaps even hyperbolical, in extolling my native land, I admit thefull justice of the remark. I am proud of this free and happycountry. My form dilates, my eye glistens, my breast heaves, myheart swells, my bosom burns, when I call to mind her greatnessand her glory.’</p> 
<p>　　‘We wish, sir,’ remarked Mr Pugstyles, calmly, ‘to ask you a fewquestions.’</p> 
<p>　　‘If you please, gentlemen; my time is yours—and mycountry’s—and my country’s—’ said Mr Gregsbury.</p> 
<p>　　This permission being conceded, Mr Pugstyles put on hisspectacles, and referred to a written paper which he drew from his pocket; whereupon nearly every other member of the deputationpulled a written paper from his pocket, to check Mr Pugstyles off,as he read the questions.</p> 
<p>　　This done, Mr Pugstyles proceeded to business.</p> 
<p>　　‘Question number one.—Whether, sir, you did not give avoluntary pledge previous to your election, that in event of yourbeing returned, you would immediately put down the practice ofcoughing and groaning in the House of Commons. And whetheryou did not submit to be coughed and groaned down in the veryfirst debate of the session, and have since made no effort to effect areform in this respect? Whether you did not also pledge yourself toastonish the government, and make them shrink in their shoes?</p> 
<p>　　And whether you have astonished them, and made them shrink intheir shoes, or not?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Go on to the next one, my dear Pugstyles,’ said Mr Gregsbury.</p> 
<p>　　‘Have you any explanation to offer with reference to thatquestion, sir?’ asked Mr Pugstyles.</p> 
<p>　　‘Certainly not,’ said Mr Gregsbury.</p> 
<p>　　The members of the deputation looked fiercely at each other,and afterwards at the member. ‘Dear Pugstyles’ having taken avery long stare at Mr Gregsbury over the tops of his spectacles,resumed his list of inquiries.</p> 
<p>　　‘Question number two.—Whether, sir, you did not likewise givea voluntary pledge that you would support your colleague on everyoccasion; and whether you did not, the night before last, deserthim and vote upon the other side, because the wife of a leader onthat other side had invited Mrs Gregsbury to an evening party?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Go on,’ said Mr Gregsbury.</p> 
<p>　　‘Nothing to say on that, either, sir?’ asked the spokesman.</p> 
<p>　　 ‘Nothing whatever,’ replied Mr Gregsbury. The deputation, whohad only seen him at canvassing or election time, were struckdumb by his coolness. He didn’t appear like the same man; thenhe was all milk and honey; now he was all starch and vinegar. Butmen are so different at different times!</p> 
<p>　　‘Question number three—and last,’ said Mr Pugstyles,emphatically. ‘Whether, sir, you did not state upon the hustings,that it was your firm and determined intention to opposeeverything proposed; to divide the house upon every question, tomove for returns on every subject, to place a motion on the booksevery day, and, in short, in your own memorable words, to play thevery devil with everything and everybody?’ With thiscomprehensive inquiry, Mr Pugstyles folded up his list ofquestions, as did all his backers.</p> 
<p>　　Mr Gregsbury reflected, blew his nose, threw himself furtherback in his chair, came forward again, leaning his elbows on thetable, made a triangle with his two thumbs and his two forefingers,and tapping his nose with the apex thereof, replied (smiling as hesaid it), ‘I deny everything.’</p> 
<p>　　At this unexpected answer, a hoarse murmur arose from thedeputation; and the same gentleman who had expressed anopinion relative to the gammoning nature of the introductoryspeech, again made a monosyllabic demonstration, by growlingout ‘Resign!’ Which growl being taken up by his fellows, swelledinto a very earnest and general remonstrance.</p> 
<p>　　‘I am requested, sir, to express a hope,’ said Mr Pugstyles, witha distant bow, ‘that on receiving a requisition to that effect from agreat majority of your constituents, you will not object at once toresign your seat in favour of some candidate whom they think they can better trust.’</p> 
<p>　　To this, Mr Gregsbury read the following reply, which,anticipating the request, he had composed in the form of a letter,whereof copies had been made to send round to the newspapers.</p> 
<p>　　‘My Dear Mr Pugstyles,‘Next to the welfare of our beloved island—this great and freeand happy country, whose powers and resources are, I sincerelybelieve, illimitable—I value that noble independence which is anEnglishman’s proudest boast, and which I fondly hope to bequeathto my children, untarnished and unsullied. Actuated by nopersonal motives, but moved only by high and great constitutionalconsiderations; which I will not attempt to explain, for they arereally beneath the comprehension of those who have not madethemselves masters, as I have, of the intricate and arduous studyof politics; I would rather keep my seat, and intend doing so.</p> 
<p>　　‘Will you do me the favour to present my compliments to theconstituent body, and acquaint them with this circumstance?</p> 
<p>　　‘With great esteem,‘My dear Mr Pugstyles, ‘&amp;c.&amp;c.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Then you will not resign, under any circumstances?’ asked thespokesman.</p> 
<p>　　Mr Gregsbury smiled, and shook his head.</p> 
<p>　　‘Then, good-morning, sir,’ said Pugstyles, angrily.</p> 
<p>　　‘Heaven bless you!’ said Mr Gregsbury. And the deputation,with many growls and scowls, filed off as quickly as thenarrowness of the staircase would allow of their getting down.</p> 
<p>　　The last man being gone, Mr Gregsbury rubbed his hands and chuckled, as merry fellows will, when they think they have said ordone a more than commonly good thing; he was so engrossed inthis self-congratulation, that he did not observe that Nicholas hadbeen left behind in the shadow of the window-curtains, until thatyoung gentleman, fearing he might otherwise overhear somesoliloquy intended to have no listeners, coughed twice or thrice, toattract the member’s notice.</p> 
<p>　　‘What’s that?’ said Mr Gregsbury, in sharp accents.</p> 
<p>　　Nicholas stepped forward, and bowed.</p> 
<p>　　‘What do you do here, sir?’ asked Mr Gregsbury; ‘a spy uponmy privacy! A concealed voter! You have heard my answer, sir.</p> 
<p>　　Pray follow the deputation.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I should have done so, if I had belonged to it, but I do not,’ saidNicholas.</p> 
<p>　　‘Then how came you here, sir?’ was the natural inquiry of MrGregsbury, MP. ‘And where the devil have you come from, sir?’</p> 
<p>　　was the question which followed it.</p> 
<p>　　‘I brought this card from the General Agency Office, sir,’ saidNicholas, ‘wishing to offer myself as your secretary, andunderstanding that you stood in need of one.’</p> 
<p>　　‘That’s all you have come for, is it?’ said Mr Gregsbury, eyeinghim in some doubt.</p> 
<p>　　Nicholas replied in the affirmative.</p> 
<p>　　‘You have no connection with any of those rascally papers haveyou?’ said Mr Gregsbury. ‘You didn’t get into the room, to hearwhat was going forward, and put it in print, eh?’</p> 
<p>　　‘I have no connection, I am sorry to say, with anything atpresent,’ rejoined Nicholas,—politely enough, but quite at his ease.</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh!’ said Mr Gregsbury. ‘How did you find your way up here, then?’</p> 
<p>　　Nicholas related how he had been forced up by the deputation.</p> 
<p>　　‘That was the way, was it?’ said Mr Gregsbury. ‘Sit down.’</p> 
<p>　　Nicholas took a chair, and Mr Gregsbury stared at him for along time, as if to make certain, before he asked any furtherquestions, that there were no objections to his outwardappearance.</p> 
<p>　　‘You want to be my secretary, do you?’ he said at length.</p> 
<p>　　‘I wish to be employed in that capacity, sir,’ replied Nicholas.</p> 
<p>　　‘Well,’ said Mr Gregsbury; ‘now what can you do?’</p> 
<p>　　‘I suppose,’ replied Nicholas, smiling, ‘that I can do whatusually falls to the lot of other secretaries.’</p> 
<p>　　‘What’s that?’ inquired Mr Gregsbury.</p> 
<p>　　‘What is it?’ replied Nicholas.</p> 
<p>　　‘Ah! What is it?’ retorted the member, looking shrewdly at him,with his head on one side.</p> 
<p>　　‘A secretary’s duties are rather difficult to define, perhaps,’ saidNicholas, considering. ‘They include, I presume, correspondence?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Good,’ interposed Mr Gregsbury.</p> 
<p>　　‘The arrangement of papers and documents?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Very good.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Occasionally, perhaps, the writing from your dictation; andpossibly, sir,’ said Nicholas, with a half-smile, ‘the copying of yourspeech for some public journal, when you have made one of morethan usual importance.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Certainly,’ rejoined Mr Gregsbury. ‘What else?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Really,’ said Nicholas, after a moment’s reflection, ‘I am notable, at this instant, to recapitulate any other duty of a secretary,beyond the general one of making himself as agreeable and useful to his employer as he can, consistently with his own respectability,and without overstepping that line of duties which he undertakesto perform, and which the designation of his office is usuallyunderstood to imply.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr Gregsbury looked fixedly at Nicholas for a short time, andthen glancing warily round the room, said in a suppressed voice:</p> 
<p>　　‘This is all very well, Mr—what is your name?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Nickleby.’</p> 
<p>　　‘This is all very well, Mr Nickleby, and very proper, so far as itgoes—so far as it goes, but it doesn’t go far enough. There areother duties, Mr Nickleby, which a secretary to a parliamentarygentleman must never lose sight of. I should require to becrammed, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I beg your pardon,’ interposed Nicholas, doubtful whether hehad heard aright.</p> 
<p>　　‘—To be crammed, sir,’ repeated Mr Gregsbury.</p> 
<p>　　‘May I beg your pardon again, if I inquire what you mean, sir?’</p> 
<p>　　said Nicholas.</p> 
<p>　　‘My meaning, sir, is perfectly plain,’ replied Mr Gregsbury witha solemn aspect. ‘My secretary would have to make himself masterof the foreign policy of the world, as it is mirrored in thenewspapers; to run his eye over all accounts of public meetings, allleading articles, and accounts of the proceedings of public bodies;and to make notes of anything which it appeared to him might bemade a point of, in any little speech upon the question of somepetition lying on the table, or anything of that kind. Do youunderstand?’</p> 
<p>　　‘I think I do, sir,’ replied Nicholas.</p> 
<p>　　‘Then,’ said Mr Gregsbury, ‘it would be necessary for him to make himself acquainted, from day to day, with newspaperparagraphs on passing events; such as “Mysterious disappearance,and supposed suicide of a potboy,” or anything of that sort, uponwhich I might found a question to the Secretary of State for theHome Department. Then, he would have to copy the question, andas much as I remembered of the answer (including a littlecompliment about independence and good sense); and to send themanuscript in a frank to the local paper, with perhaps half-adozen lines of leader, to the effect, that I was always to be found inmy place in parliament, and never shrunk from the responsibleand arduous duties, and so forth. You see?’</p> 
<p>　　Nicholas bowed.</p> 
<p>　　‘Besides which,’ continued Mr Gregsbury, ‘I should expect him,now and then, to go through a few figures in the printed tables,and to pick out a few results, so that I might come out pretty wellon timber duty questions, and finance questions, and so on; and Ishould like him to get up a few little arguments about thedisastrous effects of a return to cash payments and a metalliccurrency, with a touch now and then about the exportation ofbullion, and the Emperor of Russia, and bank notes, and all thatkind of thing, which it’s only necessary to talk fluently about,because nobody understands it. Do you take me?’</p> 
<p>　　‘I think I understand,’ said Nicholas.</p> 
<p>　　‘With regard to such questions as are not political,’ continuedMr Gregsbury, warming; ‘and which one can’t be expected to carea curse about, beyond the natural care of not allowing inferiorpeople to be as well off as ourselves—else where are ourprivileges?—I should wish my secretary to get together a few littleflourishing speeches, of a patriotic cast. For instance, if any preposterous bill were brought forward, for giving poor grubbingdevils of authors a right to their own property, I should like to say,that I for one would never consent to opposing an insurmountablebar to the diffusion of literature among The People,—youunderstand?—that the creations of the pocket, being man’s, mightbelong to one man, or one family; but that the creations of thebrain, being God’s, ought as a matter of course to belong to thepeople at large—and if I was pleasantly disposed, I should like tomake a joke about posterity, and say that those who wrote forposterity should be content to be rewarded by the approbation OFposterity; it might take with the house, and could never do me anyharm, because posterity can’t be expected to know anything aboutme or my jokes either—do you see?’</p> 
<p>　　‘I see that, sir,’ replied Nicholas.</p> 
<p>　　‘You must always bear in mind, in such cases as this, where ourinterests are not affected,’ said Mr Gregsbury, ‘to put it very strongabout the people, because it comes out very well at election-time;and you could be as funny as you liked about the authors; becauseI believe the greater part of them live in lodgings, and are notvoters. This is a hasty outline of the chief things you’d have to do,except waiting in the lobby every night, in case I forgot anything,and should want fresh cramming; and, now and then, during greatdebates, sitting in the front row of the gallery, and saying to thepeople about—“You see that gentleman, with his hand to his face,and his arm twisted round the pillar—that’s Mr Gregsbury—thecelebrated Mr Gregsbury,”—with any other little eulogium thatmight strike you at the moment. And for salary,’ said MrGregsbury, winding up with great rapidity; for he was out ofbreath—‘and for salary, I don’t mind saying at once in round numbers, to prevent any dissatisfaction—though it’s more thanI’ve been accustomed to give—fifteen shillings a week, and findyourself. There!’</p> 
<p>　　With this handsome offer, Mr Gregsbury once more threwhimself back in his chair, and looked like a man who had beenmost profligately liberal, but is determined not to repent of itnotwithstanding.</p> 
<p>　　‘Fifteen shillings a week is not much,’ said Nicholas, mildly.</p> 
<p>　　‘Not much! Fifteen shillings a week not much, young man?’</p> 
<p>　　cried Mr Gregsbury. ‘Fifteen shillings a—’</p> 
<p>　　‘Pray do not suppose that I quarrel with the sum, sir,’ repliedNicholas; ‘for I am not ashamed to confess, that whatever it maybe in itself, to me it is a great deal. But the duties andresponsibilities make the recompense small, and they are so veryheavy that I fear to undertake them.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Do you decline to undertake them, sir?’ inquired MrGregsbury, with his hand on the bell-rope.</p> 
<p>　　‘I fear they are too great for my powers, however good my willmay be, sir,’ replied Nicholas.</p> 
<p>　　‘That is as much as to say that you had rather not accept theplace, and that you consider fifteen shillings a week too little,’ saidMr Gregsbury, ringing. ‘Do you decline it, sir?’</p> 
<p>　　‘I have no alternative but to do so,’ replied Nicholas.</p> 
<p>　　‘Door, Matthews!’ said Mr Gregsbury, as the boy appeared.</p> 
<p>　　‘I am sorry I have troubled you unnecessarily, sir,’ saidNicholas,‘I am sorry you have,’ rejoined Mr Gregsbury, turning his backupon him. ‘Door, Matthews!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Good-morning, sir,’ said Nicholas.</p> 
<p>　　 ‘Door, Matthews!’ cried Mr Gregsbury.</p> 
<p>　　The boy beckoned Nicholas, and tumbling lazily downstairsbefore him, opened the door, and ushered him into the street.</p> 
<p>　　With a sad and pensive air, he retraced his steps homewards.</p> 
<p>　　Smike had scraped a meal together from the remnant of lastnight’s supper, and was anxiously awaiting his return. Theoccurrences of the morning had not improved Nicholas’s appetite,and, by him, the dinner remained untasted. He was sitting in athoughtful attitude, with the plate which the poor fellow hadassiduously filled with the choicest morsels, untouched, by hisside, when Newman Noggs looked into the room.</p> 
<p>　　‘Come back?’ asked Newman.</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes,’ replied Nicholas, ‘tired to death: and, what is worse,might have remained at home for all the good I have done.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Couldn’t expect to do much in one morning,’ said Newman.</p> 
<p>　　‘Maybe so, but I am sanguine, and did expect,’ said Nicholas,‘and am proportionately disappointed.’ Saying which, he gaveNewman an account of his proceedings.</p> 
<p>　　‘If I could do anything,’ said Nicholas, ‘anything, howeverslight, until Ralph Nickleby returns, and I have eased my mind byconfronting him, I should feel happier. I should think it nodisgrace to work, Heaven knows. Lying indolently here, like a half-tamed sullen beast, distracts me.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I don’t know,’ said Newman; ‘small things offer—they wouldpay the rent, and more—but you wouldn’t like them; no, you couldhardly be expected to undergo it—no, no.’</p> 
<p>　　‘What could I hardly be expected to undergo?’ asked Nicholas,raising his eyes. ‘Show me, in this wide waste of London, anyhonest means by which I could even defray the weekly hire of this poor room, and see if I shrink from resorting to them! Undergo! Ihave undergone too much, my friend, to feel pride orsqueamishness now. Except—’ added Nicholas hastily, after ashort silence, ‘except such squeamishness as is common honesty,and so much pride as constitutes self-respect. I see little to choose,between assistant to a brutal pedagogue, and toad-eater to a meanand ignorant upstart, be he member or no member.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I hardly know whether I should tell you what I heard thismorning, or not,’ said Newman.</p> 
<p>　　‘Has it reference to what you said just now?’ asked Nicholas.</p> 
<p>　　‘It has.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Then in Heaven’s name, my good friend, tell it me,’ saidNicholas. ‘For God’s sake consider my deplorable condition; and,while I promise to take no step without taking counsel with you,give me, at least, a vote in my own behalf.’</p> 
<p>　　Moved by this entreaty, Newman stammered forth a variety ofmost unaccountable and entangled sentences, the upshot of whichwas, that Mrs Kenwigs had examined him, at great length thatmorning, touching the origin of his acquaintance with, and thewhole life, adventures, and pedigree of, Nicholas; that Newmanhad parried these questions as long as he could, but being, atlength, hard pressed and driven into a corner, had gone so far asto admit, that Nicholas was a tutor of great accomplishments,involved in some misfortunes which he was not at liberty toexplain, and bearing the name of Johnson. That Mrs Kenwigs,impelled by gratitude, or ambition, or maternal pride, or maternallove, or all four powerful motives conjointly, had taken secretconference with Mr Kenwigs, and had finally returned to proposethat Mr Johnson should instruct the four Miss Kenwigses in the French language as spoken by natives, at the weekly stipend offive shillings, current coin of the realm; being at the rate of oneshilling per week, per each Miss Kenwigs, and one shilling over,until such time as the baby might be able to take it out ingrammar.</p> 
<p>　　‘Which, unless I am very much mistaken,’ observed MrsKenwigs in making the proposition, ‘will not be very long; for suchclever children, Mr Noggs, never were born into this world, I dobelieve.’</p> 
<p>　　‘There,’ said Newman, ‘that’s all. It’s beneath you, I know; but Ithought that perhaps you might—’</p> 
<p>　　‘Might!’ cried Nicholas, with great alacrity; ‘of course I shall. Iaccept the offer at once. Tell the worthy mother so, without delay,my dear fellow; and that I am ready to begin whenever shepleases.’</p> 
<p>　　Newman hastened, with joyful steps, to inform Mrs Kenwigs ofhis friend’s acquiescence, and soon returning, brought back wordthat they would be happy to see him in the first floor as soon asconvenient; that Mrs Kenwigs had, upon the instant, sent out tosecure a second-hand French grammar and dialogues, which hadlong been fluttering in the sixpenny box at the bookstall round thecorner; and that the family, highly excited at the prospect of thisaddition to their gentility, wished the initiatory lesson to come offimmediately.</p> 
<p>　　And here it may be observed, that Nicholas was not, in theordinary sense of the word, a young man of high spirit. He wouldresent an affront to himself, or interpose to redress a wrongoffered to another, as boldly and freely as any knight that ever setlance in rest; but he lacked that peculiar excess of coolness and great-minded selfishness, which invariably distinguish gentlemenof high spirit. In truth, for our own part, we are disposed to lookupon such gentleman as being rather incumbrances thanotherwise in rising families: happening to be acquainted withseveral whose spirit prevents their settling down to any grovellingoccupation, and only displays itself in a tendency to cultivatemoustachios, and look fierce; and although moustachios andferocity are both very pretty things in their way, and very much tobe commended, we confess to a desire to see them bred at theowner’s proper cost, rather than at the expense of low-spiritedpeople.</p> 
<p>　　Nicholas, therefore, not being a high-spirited young manaccording to common parlance, and deeming it a greaterdegradation to borrow, for the supply of his necessities, fromNewman Noggs, than to teach French to the little Kenwigses forfive shillings a week, accepted the offer with the alacrity alreadydescribed, and betook himself to the first floor with all convenientspeed.</p> 
<p>　　Here, he was received by Mrs Kenwigs with a genteel air,kindly intended to assure him of her protection and support; andhere, too, he found Mr Lillyvick and Miss Petowker; the four MissKenwigses on their form of audience; and the baby in a dwarfporter’s chair with a deal tray before it, amusing himself with a toyhorse without a head; the said horse being composed of a smallwooden cylinder, not unlike an Italian iron, supported on fourcrooked pegs, and painted in ingenious resemblance of red wafersset in blacking.</p> 
<p>　　‘How do you do, Mr Johnson?’ said Mrs Kenwigs. ‘Uncle—MrJohnson.’</p> 
<p>　　 ‘How do you do, sir?’ said Mr Lillyvick—rather sharply; for hehad not known what Nicholas was, on the previous night, and itwas rather an aggravating circumstance if a tax collector had beentoo polite to a teacher.</p> 
<p>　　‘Mr Johnson is engaged as private master to the children,uncle,’ said Mrs Kenwigs.</p> 
<p>　　‘So you said just now, my dear,’ replied Mr Lillyvick.</p> 
<p>　　‘But I hope,’ said Mrs Kenwigs, drawing herself up, ‘that thatwill not make them proud; but that they will bless their own goodfortune, which has born them superior to common people’schildren. Do you hear, Morleena?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, ma,’ replied Miss Kenwigs.</p> 
<p>　　‘And when you go out in the streets, or elsewhere, I desire thatyou don’t boast of it to the other children,’ said Mrs Kenwigs; ‘andthat if you must say anything about it, you don’t say no more than“We’ve got a private master comes to teach us at home, but weain’t proud, because ma says it’s sinful.” Do you hear, Morleena?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, ma,’ replied Miss Kenwigs again.</p> 
<p>　　‘Then mind you recollect, and do as I tell you,’ said MrsKenwigs. ‘Shall Mr Johnson begin, uncle?’</p> 
<p>　　‘I am ready to hear, if Mr Johnson is ready to commence, mydear,’ said the collector, assuming the air of a profound critic.</p> 
<p>　　‘What sort of language do you consider French, sir?’</p> 
<p>　　‘How do you mean?’ asked Nicholas.</p> 
<p>　　‘Do you consider it a good language, sir?’ said the collector; ‘apretty language, a sensible language?’</p> 
<p>　　‘A pretty language, certainly,’ replied Nicholas; ‘and as it has aname for everything, and admits of elegant conversation abouteverything, I presume it is a sensible one.’</p> 
<p>　　 ‘I don’t know,’ said Mr Lillyvick, doubtfully. ‘Do you call it acheerful language, now?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes,’ replied Nicholas, ‘I should say it was, certainly.’</p> 
<p>　　‘It’s very much changed since my time, then,’ said the collector,‘very much.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Was it a dismal one in your time?’ asked Nicholas, scarcelyable to repress a smile.</p> 
<p>　　‘Very,’ replied Mr Lillyvick, with some vehemence of manner.</p> 
<p>　　‘It’s the war time that I speak of; the last war. It may be a cheerfullanguage. I should be sorry to contradict anybody; but I can onlysay that I’ve heard the French prisoners, who were natives, andought to know how to speak it, talking in such a dismal manner,that it made one miserable to hear them. Ay, that I have, fiftytimes, sir—fifty times!’</p> 
<p>　　Mr Lillyvick was waxing so cross, that Mrs Kenwigs thought itexpedient to motion to Nicholas not to say anything; and it was notuntil Miss Petowker had practised several blandishments, tosoften the excellent old gentleman, that he deigned to breaksilence by asking,‘What’s the water in French, sir?’</p> 
<p>　　‘L’eau,’ replied Nicholas.</p> 
<p>　　‘Ah!’ said Mr Lillyvick, shaking his head mournfully, ‘I thoughtas much. Lo, eh? I don’t think anything of that language—nothingat all.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I suppose the children may begin, uncle?’ said Mrs Kenwigs.</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh yes; they may begin, my dear,’ replied the collector,discontentedly. ‘I have no wish to prevent them.’</p> 
<p>　　This permission being conceded, the four Miss Kenwigses sat ina row, with their tails all one way, and Morleena at the top: while Nicholas, taking the book, began his preliminary explanations.</p> 
<p>　　Miss Petowker and Mrs Kenwigs looked on, in silent admiration,broken only by the whispered assurances of the latter, thatMorleena would have it all by heart in no time; and Mr Lillyvickregarded the group with frowning and attentive eyes, lying in waitfor something upon which he could open a fresh discussion on thelanguage.</p>
