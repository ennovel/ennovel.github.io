<p>　　As Mr Crummles had a strange four-legged animal in theinn stables, which he called a pony, and a vehicle ofunknown design, on which he bestowed the appellation ofa four-wheeled phaeton, Nicholas proceeded on his journey nextmorning with greater ease than he had expected: the manager andhimself occupying the front seat: and the Master Crummleses andSmike being packed together behind, in company with a wickerbasket defended from wet by a stout oilskin, in which were thebroad-swords, pistols, pigtails, nautical costumes, and otherprofessional necessaries of the aforesaid young gentlemen.</p> 
<p>　　The pony took his time upon the road, and—possibly inconsequence of his theatrical education—evinced, every now andthen, a strong inclination to lie down. However, Mr VincentCrummles kept him up pretty well, by jerking the rein, and plyingthe whip; and when these means failed, and the animal came to astand, the elder Master Crummles got out and kicked him. By dintof these encouragements, he was persuaded to move from time totime, and they jogged on (as Mr Crummles truly observed) verycomfortably for all parties.</p> 
<p>　　‘He’s a good pony at bottom,’ said Mr Crummles, turning toNicholas.</p> 
<p>　　He might have been at bottom, but he certainly was not at top,seeing that his coat was of the roughest and most ill-favoured kind.</p> 
<p>　　 So, Nicholas merely observed that he shouldn’t wonder if he was.</p> 
<p>　　‘Many and many is the circuit this pony has gone,’ said MrCrummles, flicking him skilfully on the eyelid for oldacquaintance’ sake. ‘He is quite one of us. His mother was on thestage.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Was she?’ rejoined Nicholas.</p> 
<p>　　‘She ate apple-pie at a circus for upwards of fourteen years,’</p> 
<p>　　said the manager; ‘fired pistols, and went to bed in a nightcap;and, in short, took the low comedy entirely. His father was adancer.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Was he at all distinguished?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Not very,’ said the manager. ‘He was rather a low sort of pony.</p> 
<p>　　The fact is, he had been originally jobbed out by the day, and henever quite got over his old habits. He was clever in melodramatoo, but too broad—too broad. When the mother died, he took theport-wine business.’</p> 
<p>　　‘The port-wine business!’ cried Nicholas.</p> 
<p>　　‘Drinking port-wine with the clown,’ said the manager; ‘but hewas greedy, and one night bit off the bowl of the glass, and chokedhimself, so his vulgarity was the death of him at last.’</p> 
<p>　　The descendant of this ill-starred animal requiring increasedattention from Mr Crummles as he progressed in his day’s work,that gentleman had very little time for conversation. Nicholas wasthus left at leisure to entertain himself with his own thoughts, untilthey arrived at the drawbridge at Portsmouth, when Mr Crummlespulled up.</p> 
<p>　　‘We’ll get down here,’ said the manager, ‘and the boys will takehim round to the stable, and call at my lodgings with the luggage.</p> 
<p>　　You had better let yours be taken there, for the present.’</p> 
<p>　　 Thanking Mr Vincent Crummles for his obliging offer, Nicholasjumped out, and, giving Smike his arm, accompanied the managerup High Street on their way to the theatre; feeling nervous anduncomfortable enough at the prospect of an immediateintroduction to a scene so new to him.</p> 
<p>　　They passed a great many bills, pasted against the walls anddisplayed in windows, wherein the names of Mr VincentCrummles, Mrs Vincent Crummles, Master Crummles, Master P.</p> 
<p>　　Crummles, and Miss Crummles, were printed in very large letters,and everything else in very small ones; and, turning at length intoan entry, in which was a strong smell of orange-peel and lamp-oil,with an under-current of sawdust, groped their way through adark passage, and, descending a step or two, threaded a little mazeof canvas screens and paint pots, and emerged upon the stage ofthe Portsmouth Theatre.</p> 
<p>　　‘Here we are,’ said Mr Crummles.</p> 
<p>　　It was not very light, but Nicholas found himself close to thefirst entrance on the prompt side, among bare walls, dusty scenes,mildewed clouds, heavily daubed draperies, and dirty floors. Helooked about him; ceiling, pit, boxes, gallery, orchestra, fittings,and decorations of every kind,—all looked coarse, cold, gloomy,and wretched.</p> 
<p>　　‘Is this a theatre?’ whispered Smike, in amazement; ‘I thoughtit was a blaze of light and finery.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Why, so it is,’ replied Nicholas, hardly less surprised; ‘but notby day, Smike—not by day.’</p> 
<p>　　The manager’s voice recalled him from a more carefulinspection of the building, to the opposite side of the proscenium,where, at a small mahogany table with rickety legs and of an oblong shape, sat a stout, portly female, apparently between fortyand fifty, in a tarnished silk cloak, with her bonnet dangling by thestrings in her hand, and her hair (of which she had a greatquantity) braided in a large festoon over each temple.</p> 
<p>　　‘Mr Johnson,’ said the manager (for Nicholas had given thename which Newman Noggs had bestowed upon him in hisconversation with Mrs Kenwigs), ‘let me introduce Mrs VincentCrummles.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I am glad to see you, sir,’ said Mrs Vincent Crummles, in asepulchral voice. ‘I am very glad to see you, and still more happyto hail you as a promising member of our corps.’</p> 
<p>　　The lady shook Nicholas by the hand as she addressed him inthese terms; he saw it was a large one, but had not expected quitesuch an iron grip as that with which she honoured him.</p> 
<p>　　‘And this,’ said the lady, crossing to Smike, as tragic actressescross when they obey a stage direction, ‘and this is the other. Youtoo, are welcome, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘He’ll do, I think, my dear?’ said the manager, taking a pinch ofsnuff.</p> 
<p>　　‘He is admirable,’ replied the lady. ‘An acquisition indeed.’</p> 
<p>　　As Mrs Vincent Crummles recrossed back to the table, therebounded on to the stage from some mysterious inlet, a little girl ina dirty white frock with tucks up to the knees, short trousers,sandaled shoes, white spencer, pink gauze bonnet, green veil andcurl papers; who turned a pirouette, cut twice in the air, turnedanother pirouette, then, looking off at the opposite wing, shrieked,bounded forward to within six inches of the footlights, and fell intoa beautiful attitude of terror, as a shabby gentleman in an old pairof buff slippers came in at one powerful slide, and chattering his teeth, fiercely brandished a walking-stick.</p> 
<p>　　‘They are going through the Indian Savage and the Maiden,’</p> 
<p>　　said Mrs Crummles.</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh!’ said the manager, ‘the little ballet interlude. Very good, goon. A little this way, if you please, Mr Johnson. That’ll do. Now!’</p> 
<p>　　The manager clapped his hands as a signal to proceed, and thesavage, becoming ferocious, made a slide towards the maiden; butthe maiden avoided him in six twirls, and came down, at the end ofthe last one, upon the very points of her toes. This seemed to makesome impression upon the savage; for, after a little more ferocityand chasing of the maiden into corners, he began to relent, andstroked his face several times with his right thumb and fourfingers, thereby intimating that he was struck with admiration ofthe maiden’s beauty. Acting upon the impulse of this passion, he(the savage) began to hit himself severe thumps in the chest, andto exhibit other indications of being desperately in love, whichbeing rather a prosy proceeding, was very likely the cause of themaiden’s falling asleep; whether it was or no, asleep she did fall,sound as a church, on a sloping bank, and the savage perceiving it,leant his left ear on his left hand, and nodded sideways, to intimateto all whom it might concern that she was asleep, and noshamming. Being left to himself, the savage had a dance, all alone.</p> 
<p>　　Just as he left off, the maiden woke up, rubbed her eyes, got off thebank, and had a dance all alone too—such a dance that the savagelooked on in ecstasy all the while, and when it was done, pluckedfrom a neighbouring tree some botanical curiosity, resembling asmall pickled cabbage, and offered it to the maiden, who at firstwouldn’t have it, but on the savage shedding tears relented. Thenthe savage jumped for joy; then the maiden jumped for rapture at the sweet smell of the pickled cabbage. Then the savage and themaiden danced violently together, and, finally, the savage droppeddown on one knee, and the maiden stood on one leg upon hisother knee; thus concluding the ballet, and leaving the spectatorsin a state of pleasing uncertainty, whether she would ultimatelymarry the savage, or return to her friends.</p> 
<p>　　‘Very well indeed,’ said Mr Crummles; ‘bravo!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Bravo!’ cried Nicholas, resolved to make the best of everything.</p> 
<p>　　‘Beautiful!’ ‘This, sir,’ said Mr Vincent Crummles, bringing themaiden forward, ‘this is the infant phenomenon—Miss NinettaCrummles.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Your daughter?’ inquired Nicholas.</p> 
<p>　　‘My daughter—my daughter,’ replied Mr Vincent Crummles;‘the idol of every place we go into, sir. We have had complimentaryletters about this girl, sir, from the nobility and gentry of almostevery town in England.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I am not surprised at that,’ said Nicholas; ‘she must be quite anatural genius.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Quite a—!’ Mr Crummles stopped: language was not powerfulenough to describe the infant phenomenon. ‘I’ll tell you what, sir,’</p> 
<p>　　he said; ‘the talent of this child is not to be imagined. She must beseen, sir—seen—to be ever so faintly appreciated. There; go toyour mother, my dear.’</p> 
<p>　　‘May I ask how old she is?’ inquired Nicholas.</p> 
<p>　　‘You may, sir,’ replied Mr Crummles, looking steadily in hisquestioner’s face, as some men do when they have doubts aboutbeing implicitly believed in what they are going to say. ‘She is tenyears of age, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Not more!’</p> 
<p>　　 ‘Not a day.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Dear me!’ said Nicholas, ‘it’s extraordinary.’</p> 
<p>　　It was; for the infant phenomenon, though of short stature, hada comparatively aged countenance, and had moreover beenprecisely the same age—not perhaps to the full extent of thememory of the oldest inhabitant, but certainly for five good years.</p> 
<p>　　But she had been kept up late every night, and put upon anunlimited allowance of gin-and-water from infancy, to prevent hergrowing tall, and perhaps this system of training had produced inthe infant phenomenon these additional phenomena.</p> 
<p>　　While this short dialogue was going on, the gentleman who hadenacted the savage, came up, with his walking shoes on his feet,and his slippers in his hand, to within a few paces, as if desirous tojoin in the conversation. Deeming this a good opportunity, he putin his word.</p> 
<p>　　‘Talent there, sir!’ said the savage, nodding towards MissCrummles.</p> 
<p>　　Nicholas assented.</p> 
<p>　　‘Ah!’ said the actor, setting his teeth together, and drawing inhis breath with a hissing sound, ‘she oughtn’t to be in theprovinces, she oughtn’t.’</p> 
<p>　　‘What do you mean?’ asked the manager.</p> 
<p>　　‘I mean to say,’ replied the other, warmly, ‘that she is too goodfor country boards, and that she ought to be in one of the largehouses in London, or nowhere; and I tell you more, withoutmincing the matter, that if it wasn’t for envy and jealousy in somequarter that you know of, she would be. Perhaps you’ll introduceme here, Mr Crummles.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Mr Folair,’ said the manager, presenting him to Nicholas.</p> 
<p>　　 ‘Happy to know you, sir.’ Mr Folair touched the brim of his hatwith his forefinger, and then shook hands. ‘A recruit, sir, Iunderstand?’</p> 
<p>　　‘An unworthy one,’ replied Nicholas.</p> 
<p>　　‘Did you ever see such a set-out as that?’ whispered the actor,drawing him away, as Crummles left them to speak to his wife.</p> 
<p>　　‘As what?’</p> 
<p>　　Mr Folair made a funny face from his pantomime collection,and pointed over his shoulder.</p> 
<p>　　‘You don’t mean the infant phenomenon?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Infant humbug, sir,’ replied Mr Folair. ‘There isn’t a femalechild of common sharpness in a charity school, that couldn’t dobetter than that. She may thank her stars she was born amanager’s daughter.’</p> 
<p>　　‘You seem to take it to heart,’ observed Nicholas, with a smile.</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, by Jove, and well I may,’ said Mr Folair, drawing his armthrough his, and walking him up and down the stage. ‘Isn’t itenough to make a man crusty to see that little sprawler put up inthe best business every night, and actually keeping money out ofthe house, by being forced down the people’s throats, while otherpeople are passed over? Isn’t it extraordinary to see a man’sconfounded family conceit blinding him, even to his own interest?</p> 
<p>　　Why I know of fifteen and sixpence that came to Southampton onenight last month, to see me dance the Highland Fling; and what’sthe consequence? I’ve never been put up in it since—never once—while the “infant phenomenon” has been grinning throughartificial flowers at five people and a baby in the pit, and two boysin the gallery, every night.’</p> 
<p>　　‘If I may judge from what I have seen of you,’ said Nicholas, ‘you must be a valuable member of the company.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh!’ replied Mr Folair, beating his slippers together, to knockthe dust out; ‘I can come it pretty well—nobody better, perhaps, inmy own line—but having such business as one gets here, is likeputting lead on one’s feet instead of chalk, and dancing in fetterswithout the credit of it. Holloa, old fellow, how are you?’</p> 
<p>　　The gentleman addressed in these latter words was a dark-complexioned man, inclining indeed to sallow, with long thickblack hair, and very evident inclinations (although he was closeshaved) of a stiff beard, and whiskers of the same deep shade. Hisage did not appear to exceed thirty, though many at first sightwould have considered him much older, as his face was long, andvery pale, from the constant application of stage paint. He wore achecked shirt, an old green coat with new gilt buttons, aneckerchief of broad red and green stripes, and full blue trousers;he carried, too, a common ash walking-stick, apparently more forshow than use, as he flourished it about, with the hooked enddownwards, except when he raised it for a few seconds, andthrowing himself into a fencing attitude, made a pass or two at theside-scenes, or at any other object, animate or inanimate, thatchanced to afford him a pretty good mark at the moment.</p> 
<p>　　‘Well, Tommy,’ said this gentleman, making a thrust at hisfriend, who parried it dexterously with his slipper, ‘what’s thenews?’</p> 
<p>　　‘A new appearance, that’s all,’ replied Mr Folair, looking atNicholas.</p> 
<p>　　‘Do the honours, Tommy, do the honours,’ said the othergentleman, tapping him reproachfully on the crown of the hat withhis stick.</p> 
<p>　　 ‘This is Mr Lenville, who does our first tragedy, Mr Johnson,’</p> 
<p>　　said the pantomimist.</p> 
<p>　　‘Except when old bricks and mortar takes it into his head to doit himself, you should add, Tommy,’ remarked Mr Lenville. ‘Youknow who bricks and mortar is, I suppose, sir?’</p> 
<p>　　‘I do not, indeed,’ replied Nicholas.</p> 
<p>　　‘We call Crummles that, because his style of acting is rather inthe heavy and ponderous way,’ said Mr Lenville. ‘I mustn’t becracking jokes though, for I’ve got a part of twelve lengths here,which I must be up in tomorrow night, and I haven’t had time tolook at it yet; I’m a confounded quick study, that’s one comfort.’</p> 
<p>　　Consoling himself with this reflection, Mr Lenville drew fromhis coat pocket a greasy and crumpled manuscript, and, havingmade another pass at his friend, proceeded to walk to and fro,conning it to himself and indulging occasionally in suchappropriate action as his imagination and the text suggested.</p> 
<p>　　A pretty general muster of the company had by this time takenplace; for besides Mr Lenville and his friend Tommy, there werepresent, a slim young gentleman with weak eyes, who played thelow-spirited lovers and sang tenor songs, and who had come arm-in-arm with the comic countryman—a man with a turned-up nose,large mouth, broad face, and staring eyes. Making himself veryamiable to the infant phenomenon, was an inebriated elderlygentleman in the last depths of shabbiness, who played the calmand virtuous old men; and paying especial court to Mrs Crummleswas another elderly gentleman, a shade more respectable, whoplayed the irascible old men—those funny fellows who havenephews in the army and perpetually run about with thick sticksto compel them to marry heiresses. Besides these, there was a roving-looking person in a rough great-coat, who strode up anddown in front of the lamps, flourishing a dress cane, and rattlingaway, in an undertone, with great vivacity for the amusement ofan ideal audience. He was not quite so young as he had been, andhis figure was rather running to seed; but there was an air ofexaggerated gentility about him, which bespoke the hero ofswaggering comedy. There was, also, a little group of three or fouryoung men with lantern jaws and thick eyebrows, who wereconversing in one corner; but they seemed to be of secondaryimportance, and laughed and talked together without attractingany attention.</p> 
<p>　　The ladies were gathered in a little knot by themselves roundthe rickety table before mentioned. There was Miss Snevellicci—who could do anything, from a medley dance to Lady Macbeth,and also always played some part in blue silk knee-smalls at herbenefit—glancing, from the depths of her coal-scuttle strawbonnet, at Nicholas, and affecting to be absorbed in the recital of adiverting story to her friend Miss Ledrook, who had brought herwork, and was making up a ruff in the most natural mannerpossible. There was Miss Belvawney—who seldom aspired tospeaking parts, and usually went on as a page in white silk hose, tostand with one leg bent, and contemplate the audience, or to go inand out after Mr Crummles in stately tragedy—twisting up theringlets of the beautiful Miss Bravassa, who had once had herlikeness taken ‘in character’ by an engraver’s apprentice, whereofimpressions were hung up for sale in the pastry-cook’s window,and the greengrocer’s, and at the circulating library, and the box-office, whenever the announce bills came out for her annual night.</p> 
<p>　　There was Mrs Lenville, in a very limp bonnet and veil, decidedly in that way in which she would wish to be if she truly loved MrLenville; there was Miss Gazingi, with an imitation ermine boatied in a loose knot round her neck, flogging Mr Crummles, junior,with both ends, in fun. Lastly, there was Mrs Grudden in a browncloth pelisse and a beaver bonnet, who assisted Mrs Crummles inher domestic affairs, and took money at the doors, and dressed theladies, and swept the house, and held the prompt book wheneverybody else was on for the last scene, and acted any kind ofpart on any emergency without ever learning it, and was put downin the bills under my name or names whatever, that occurred toMr Crummles as looking well in print.</p> 
<p>　　Mr Folair having obligingly confided these particulars toNicholas, left him to mingle with his fellows; the work of personalintroduction was completed by Mr Vincent Crummles, whopublicly heralded the new actor as a prodigy of genius andlearning.</p> 
<p>　　‘I beg your pardon,’ said Miss Snevellicci, sidling towardsNicholas, ‘but did you ever play at Canterbury?’</p> 
<p>　　‘I never did,’ replied Nicholas.</p> 
<p>　　‘I recollect meeting a gentleman at Canterbury,’ said MissSnevellicci, ‘only for a few moments, for I was leaving thecompany as he joined it, so like you that I felt almost certain it wasthe same.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I see you now for the first time,’ rejoined Nicholas with all duegallantry. ‘I am sure I never saw you before; I couldn’t haveforgotten it.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh, I’m sure—it’s very flattering of you to say so,’ retorted MissSnevellicci with a graceful bend. ‘Now I look at you again, I seethat the gentleman at Canterbury hadn’t the same eyes as you— you’ll think me very foolish for taking notice of such things, won’tyou?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Not at all,’ said Nicholas. ‘How can I feel otherwise thanflattered by your notice in any way?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh! you men are such vain creatures!’ cried Miss Snevellicci.</p> 
<p>　　Whereupon, she became charmingly confused, and, pulling outher pocket-handkerchief from a faded pink silk reticule with a giltclasp, called to Miss Ledrook—‘Led, my dear,’ said Miss Snevellicci.</p> 
<p>　　‘Well, what is the matter?’ said Miss Ledrook.</p> 
<p>　　‘It’s not the same.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Not the same what?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Canterbury—you know what I mean. Come here! I want tospeak to you.’</p> 
<p>　　But Miss Ledrook wouldn’t come to Miss Snevellicci, so MissSnevellicci was obliged to go to Miss Ledrook, which she did, in askipping manner that was quite fascinating; and Miss Ledrookevidently joked Miss Snevellicci about being struck with Nicholas;for, after some playful whispering, Miss Snevellicci hit MissLedrook very hard on the backs of her hands, and retired up, in astate of pleasing confusion.</p> 
<p>　　‘Ladies and gentlemen,’ said Mr Vincent Crummles, who hadbeen writing on a piece of paper, ‘we’ll call the Mortal Struggletomorrow at ten; everybody for the procession. Intrigue, and Waysand Means, you’re all up in, so we shall only want one rehearsal.</p> 
<p>　　Everybody at ten, if you please.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Everybody at ten,’ repeated Mrs Grudden, looking about her.</p> 
<p>　　‘On Monday morning we shall read a new piece,’ said MrCrummles; ‘the name’s not known yet, but everybody will have a good part. Mr Johnson will take care of that.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Hallo!’ said Nicholas, starting. ‘I—’</p> 
<p>　　‘On Monday morning,’ repeated Mr Crummles, raising hisvoice, to drown the unfortunate Mr Johnson’s remonstrance;‘that’ll do, ladies and gentlemen.’</p> 
<p>　　The ladies and gentlemen required no second notice to quit;and, in a few minutes, the theatre was deserted, save by theCrummles family, Nicholas, and Smike.</p> 
<p>　　‘Upon my word,’ said Nicholas, taking the manager aside, ‘Idon’t think I can be ready by Monday.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Pooh, pooh,’ replied Mr Crummles.</p> 
<p>　　‘But really I can’t,’ returned Nicholas; ‘my invention is notaccustomed to these demands, or possibly I might produce—’</p> 
<p>　　‘Invention! what the devil’s that got to do with it!’ cried themanager hastily.</p> 
<p>　　‘Everything, my dear sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Nothing, my dear sir,’ retorted the manager, with evidentimpatience. ‘Do you understand French?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Perfectly well.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Very good,’ said the manager, opening the table drawer, andgiving a roll of paper from it to Nicholas. ‘There! Just turn thatinto English, and put your name on the title-page. Damn me,’ saidMr Crummles, angrily, ‘if I haven’t often said that I wouldn’t havea man or woman in my company that wasn’t master of thelanguage, so that they might learn it from the original, and play itin English, and save all this trouble and expense.’</p> 
<p>　　Nicholas smiled and pocketed the play.</p> 
<p>　　‘What are you going to do about your lodgings?’ said MrCrummles.</p> 
<p>　　 Nicholas could not help thinking that, for the first week, itwould be an uncommon convenience to have a turn-up bedsteadin the pit, but he merely remarked that he had not turned histhoughts that way.</p> 
<p>　　‘Come home with me then,’ said Mr Crummles, ‘and my boysshall go with you after dinner, and show you the most likely place.’</p> 
<p>　　The offer was not to be refused; Nicholas and Mr Crummlesgave Mrs Crummles an arm each, and walked up the street instately array. Smike, the boys, and the phenomenon, went homeby a shorter cut, and Mrs Grudden remained behind to take somecold Irish stew and a pint of porter in the box-office.</p> 
<p>　　Mrs Crummles trod the pavement as if she were going toimmediate execution with an animating consciousness ofinnocence, and that heroic fortitude which virtue alone inspires.</p> 
<p>　　Mr Crummles, on the other hand, assumed the look and gait of ahardened despot; but they both attracted some notice from manyof the passers-by, and when they heard a whisper of ‘Mr and MrsCrummles!’ or saw a little boy run back to stare them in the face,the severe expression of their countenances relaxed, for they felt itwas popularity.</p> 
<p>　　Mr Crummles lived in St Thomas’s Street, at the house of oneBulph, a pilot, who sported a boat-green door, with window-frames of the same colour, and had the little finger of a drownedman on his parlour mantelshelf, with other maritime and naturalcuriosities. He displayed also a brass knocker, a brass plate, and abrass bell-handle, all very bright and shining; and had a mast, witha vane on the top of it, in his back yard.</p> 
<p>　　‘You are welcome,’ said Mrs Crummles, turning round toNicholas when they reached the bow-windowed front room on the first floor.</p> 
<p>　　Nicholas bowed his acknowledgments, and was unfeignedlyglad to see the cloth laid.</p> 
<p>　　‘We have but a shoulder of mutton with onion sauce,’ said MrsCrummles, in the same charnel-house voice; ‘but such as ourdinner is, we beg you to partake of it.’</p> 
<p>　　‘You are very good,’ replied Nicholas, ‘I shall do it amplejustice.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Vincent,’ said Mrs Crummles, ‘what is the hour?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Five minutes past dinner-time,’ said Mr Crummles.</p> 
<p>　　Mrs Crummles rang the bell. ‘Let the mutton and onion sauceappear.’</p> 
<p>　　The slave who attended upon Mr Bulph’s lodgers, disappeared,and after a short interval reappeared with the festive banquet.</p> 
<p>　　Nicholas and the infant phenomenon opposed each other at thepembroke-table, and Smike and the master Crummleses dined onthe sofa bedstead.</p> 
<p>　　‘Are they very theatrical people here?’ asked Nicholas.</p> 
<p>　　‘No,’ replied Mr Crummles, shaking his head, ‘far from it—farfrom it.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I pity them,’ observed Mrs Crummles.</p> 
<p>　　‘So do I,’ said Nicholas; ‘if they have no relish for theatricalentertainments, properly conducted.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Then they have none, sir,’ rejoined Mr Crummles. ‘To theinfant’s benefit, last year, on which occasion she repeated three ofher most popular characters, and also appeared in the FairyPorcupine, as originally performed by her, there was a house of nomore than four pound twelve.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Is it possible?’ cried Nicholas.</p> 
<p>　　 ‘And two pound of that was trust, pa,’ said the phenomenon.</p> 
<p>　　‘And two pound of that was trust,’ repeated Mr Crummles. ‘MrsCrummles herself has played to mere handfuls.’</p> 
<p>　　‘But they are always a taking audience, Vincent,’ said themanager’s wife.</p> 
<p>　　‘Most audiences are, when they have good acting—real goodacting—the regular thing,’ replied Mr Crummles, forcibly.</p> 
<p>　　‘Do you give lessons, ma’am?’ inquired Nicholas.</p> 
<p>　　‘I do,’ said Mrs Crummles.</p> 
<p>　　‘There is no teaching here, I suppose?’</p> 
<p>　　‘There has been,’ said Mrs Crummles. ‘I have received pupilshere. I imparted tuition to the daughter of a dealer in ships’</p> 
<p>　　provision; but it afterwards appeared that she was insane whenshe first came to me. It was very extraordinary that she shouldcome, under such circumstances.’</p> 
<p>　　Not feeling quite so sure of that, Nicholas thought it best to holdhis peace.</p> 
<p>　　‘Let me see,’ said the manager cogitating after dinner. ‘Wouldyou like some nice little part with the infant?’</p> 
<p>　　‘You are very good,’ replied Nicholas hastily; ‘but I thinkperhaps it would be better if I had somebody of my own size atfirst, in case I should turn out awkward. I should feel more athome, perhaps.’</p> 
<p>　　‘True,’ said the manager. ‘Perhaps you would. And you couldplay up to the infant, in time, you know.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Certainly,’ replied Nicholas: devoutly hoping that it would be avery long time before he was honoured with this distinction.</p> 
<p>　　‘Then I’ll tell you what we’ll do,’ said Mr Crummles. ‘You shallstudy Romeo when you’ve done that piece—don’t forget to throw the pump and tubs in by-the-bye—Juliet Miss Snevellicci, oldGrudden the nurse.—Yes, that’ll do very well. Rover too;—youmight get up Rover while you were about it, and Cassio, andJeremy Diddler. You can easily knock them off; one part helps theother so much. Here they are, cues and all.’</p> 
<p>　　With these hasty general directions Mr Crummles thrust anumber of little books into the faltering hands of Nicholas, andbidding his eldest son go with him and show where lodgings wereto be had, shook him by the hand, and wished him good night.</p> 
<p>　　There is no lack of comfortable furnished apartments inPortsmouth, and no difficulty in finding some that areproportionate to very slender finances; but the former were toogood, and the latter too bad, and they went into so many houses,and came out unsuited, that Nicholas seriously began to think heshould be obliged to ask permission to spend the night in thetheatre, after all.</p> 
<p>　　Eventually, however, they stumbled upon two small rooms upthree pair of stairs, or rather two pair and a ladder, at atobacconist’s shop, on the Common Hard: a dirty street leadingdown to the dockyard. These Nicholas engaged, only too happy tohave escaped any request for payment of a week’s rentbeforehand.</p> 
<p>　　‘There! Lay down our personal property, Smike,’ he said, aftershowing young Crummles downstairs. ‘We have fallen uponstrange times, and Heaven only knows the end of them; but I amtired with the events of these three days, and will postponereflection till tomorrow—if I can.’</p>
