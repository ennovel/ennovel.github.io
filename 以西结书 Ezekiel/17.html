<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
<br>17:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;人 子 阿 ， 你 要 向 以 色 列 家 出 谜 语 ， 设 比 喻 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Son of man, give out a dark saying, and make a comparison for the children of Israel,
<br>17:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;说 主 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 有 一 大 鹰 ， 翅 膀 大 ， 翎 毛 长 ， 羽 毛 丰 满 ， 彩 色 俱 备 ， 来 到 利 巴 嫩 ， 将 香 柏 树 梢 拧 去 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And say, This is what the Lord has said: A great eagle with great wings, full of long feathers of different colours, came to Lebanon, and took the top of the cedar:
<br>17:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 是 折 去 香 柏 树 尽 尖 的 嫩 枝 ， 叼 到 贸 易 之 地 ， 放 在 买 卖 城 中 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Biting off the highest of its young branches, he took it to the land of Canaan, and put it in a town of traders.
<br>17:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 将 以 色 列 地 的 枝 子 栽 于 肥 田 里 ， 插 在 大 水 旁 ， 如 插 柳 树 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a willow tree.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he took some of the seed of the land, planting it in fertile earth, placing it by great waters; he put it in like a willow-tree.
<br>17:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 渐 渐 生 长 ， 成 为 蔓 延 矮 小 的 葡 萄 树 。 其 枝 转 向 那 鹰 ， 其 根 在 鹰 以 下 ， 于 是 成 了 葡 萄 树 ， 生 出 枝 子 ， 发 出 小 枝 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And its growth went on and it became a vine, low and widely stretching, whose branches were turned to him and its roots were under him: so it became a vine, putting out branches and young leaves.
<br>17:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 有 一 大 鹰 ， 翅 膀 大 ， 羽 毛 多 。 这 葡 萄 树 从 栽 种 的 畦 中 向 这 鹰 弯 过 根 来 ， 发 出 枝 子 ， 好 得 它 的 浇 灌 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And there was another eagle with great wings and thick feathers: and now this vine, pushing out its roots to him, sent out its branches in his direction from the bed where it was planted, so that he might give it water.
<br>17:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 树 栽 于 肥 田 多 水 的 旁 边 ， 好 生 枝 子 ， 结 果 子 ， 成 为 佳 美 的 葡 萄 树 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He had it planted in a good field by great waters so that it might put out branches and have fruit and be a strong vine.
<br>17:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 要 说 ， 主 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 这 葡 萄 树 岂 能 发 旺 呢 ？ 鹰 岂 不 拔 出 它 的 根 来 ， 芟 除 它 的 果 子 ， 使 它 枯 干 ， 使 它 发 的 嫩 叶 都 枯 干 了 吗 ？ 也 不 用 大 力 和 多 民 ， 就 拔 出 它 的 根 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Say, This is what the Lord has said: Will it do well? will he not have its roots pulled up and its branches cut off, so that all its young leaves may become dry and it may be pulled up by its roots?
<br>17:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;葡 萄 树 虽 然 栽 种 ， 岂 能 发 旺 呢 ？ 一 经 东 风 ， 岂 不 全 然 枯 干 吗 ？ 必 在 生 长 的 畦 中 枯 干 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And if it is planted will it do well? will it not become quite dry at the touch of the east wind, drying up in the bed where it was planted?
<br>17:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 我 说 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
<br>17:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 对 那 悖 逆 之 家 说 ， 你 们 不 知 道 这 些 事 是 什 么 意 思 吗 ？ 你 要 告 诉 他 们 说 ， 巴 比 伦 王 曾 到 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 将 其 中 的 君 王 和 首 领 带 到 巴 比 伦 自 己 那 里 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean? tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem, and hath taken the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to Babylon;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Say now to this uncontrolled people, Are these things not clear to you? Say to them, See, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and took its king and its rulers away with him to Babylon;
<br>17:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;从 以 色 列 的 宗 室 中 取 一 人 与 他 立 约 ， 使 他 发 誓 ， 并 将 国 中 有 势 力 的 人 掳 去 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And hath taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he took one of the sons of the king and made an agreement with him; and he put him under an oath, and took away the great men of the land:
<br>17:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;使 国 低 微 不 能 自 强 ， 惟 因 守 盟 约 得 以 存 立 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So that the kingdom might be made low with no power of lifting itself up, but might keep his agreement to be his servants.
<br>17:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 却 背 叛 巴 比 伦 王 ， 打 发 使 者 往 埃 及 去 ， 要 他 们 给 他 马 匹 和 多 民 。 他 岂 能 亨 通 呢 ？ 行 这 样 事 的 人 岂 能 逃 脱 呢 ？ 他 背 约 岂 能 逃 脱 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But he went against his authority in sending representatives to Egypt to get from them horses and a great army. Will he do well? will he be safe who does such things? if the agreement is broken will he be safe?
<br>17:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 轻 看 向 王 所 起 的 誓 ， 背 弃 王 与 他 所 立 的 约 。 主 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 指 着 我 的 永 生 起 誓 ， 他 定 要 死 在 立 他 作 王 ， 巴 比 伦 王 的 京 都 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;By my life, says the Lord, truly in the place of the king who made him king, whose oath he put on one side and let his agreement with him be broken, even in Babylon he will come to his death.
<br>17:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;敌 人 筑 垒 造 台 ， 与 他 打 仗 的 时 候 ， 为 要 剪 除 多 人 ， 法 老 虽 领 大 军 队 和 大 群 众 ， 还 是 不 能 帮 助 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Pharaoh with his strong army and great forces will be no help to him in the war, when they put up earthworks and make strong walls for the cutting off of lives:
<br>17:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 轻 看 誓 言 ， 背 弃 盟 约 ， 已 经 投 降 ， 却 又 作 这 一 切 的 事 ， 他 必 不 能 逃 脱 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, he shall not escape.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For he put his oath on one side in letting the agreement be broken; and though he had given his hand to it, he did all these things; he will not get away safe.
<br>17:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;所 以 主 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 我 指 着 我 的 永 生 起 誓 ， 他 既 轻 看 指 我 所 起 的 誓 ， 背 弃 指 我 所 立 的 约 ， 我 必 要 使 这 罪 归 在 他 头 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And so the Lord has said, By my life, truly, for my oath which he put on one side, and my agreement which has been broken, I will send punishment on his head.
<br>17:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 必 将 我 的 网 撒 在 他 身 上 ， 他 必 在 我 的 网 罗 中 缠 住 。 我 必 带 他 到 巴 比 伦 ， 并 要 在 那 里 因 他 干 犯 我 的 罪 刑 罚 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;My net will be stretched out over him, and he will be taken in my cords, and I will send him to Babylon, and there I will be his judge for the wrong which he has done against me.
<br>17:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 的 一 切 军 队 ， 凡 逃 跑 的 ， 都 必 倒 在 刀 下 。 所 剩 下 的 ， 也 必 分 散 四 方 （ 方 原 文 作 风 ） 。 你 们 就 知 道 说 这 话 的 是 我 耶 和 华 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;All his best fighting-men will be put to the sword, and the rest will be sent away to every wind: and you will be certain that I the Lord have said it.
<br>17:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;主 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 我 要 将 香 柏 树 梢 拧 去 栽 上 ， 就 是 从 尽 尖 的 嫩 枝 中 折 一 嫩 枝 ， 栽 于 极 高 的 山 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;This is what the Lord has said: Further, I will take the highest top of the cedar and put it in the earth; cutting off from the highest of his young branches a soft one, I will have it planted on a high and great mountain;
<br>17:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 以 色 列 高 处 的 山 栽 上 。 它 就 生 枝 子 ， 结 果 子 ， 成 为 佳 美 的 香 柏 树 ， 各 类 飞 鸟 都 必 宿 在 其 下 ， 就 是 宿 在 枝 子 的 荫 下 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;It will be planted on the high mountain of Israel: it will put out branches and have fruit and be a fair cedar: under it all birds of every sort will make their living-place, resting in the shade of its branches.
<br>17:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;田 野 的 树 木 都 必 知 道 我 耶 和 华 使 高 树 矮 小 ， 矮 树 高 大 。 青 树 枯 干 ， 枯 树 发 旺 。 我 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 也 如 此 行 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And it will be clear to all the trees of the field that I the Lord have made low the high tree and made high the low tree, drying up the green tree and making the dry tree full of growth; I the Lord have said it and have done it.
