<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then looking, I saw that on the arch which was over the head of the winged ones there was seen over them what seemed like a sapphire stone, having the form of a king's seat.
<br>10:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;主 对 那 穿 细 麻 衣 的 人 说 ， 你 进 去 ， 在 旋 转 的 轮 内 基 路 伯 以 下 ， 从 基 路 伯 中 间 将 火 炭 取 满 两 手 ， 撒 在 城 上 。 我 就 见 他 进 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to the man clothed in linen, Go in between the wheels, under the winged ones, and get your two hands full of burning coals from between the winged ones and send them in a shower over the town. And he went in before my eyes.
<br>10:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 人 进 去 的 时 候 ， 基 路 伯 站 在 殿 的 右 边 ， 云 彩 充 满 了 内 院 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now the winged ones were stationed on the right side of the house when the man went in; and the inner square was full of the cloud.
<br>10:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 和 华 的 荣 耀 从 基 路 伯 那 里 上 升 ， 停 在 门 槛 以 上 。 殿 内 满 了 云 彩 ， 院 宇 也 被 耶 和 华 荣 耀 的 光 辉 充 满 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD's glory.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the glory of the Lord went up from the winged ones and came to rest over the doorstep of the house; and the house was full of the cloud and the open square was full of the shining of the Lord's glory.
<br>10:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;基 路 伯 翅 膀 的 响 声 听 到 外 院 ， 好 像 全 能 神 说 话 的 声 音 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the sound of the wings of the winged ones was clear even in the outer square, like the voice of the Ruler of all.
<br>10:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 吩 咐 那 穿 细 麻 衣 的 人 说 ， 要 从 旋 转 的 轮 内 基 路 伯 中 间 取 火 。 那 人 就 进 去 站 在 一 个 轮 子 旁 边 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he gave orders to the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the winged ones, then he went in and took his place at the side of a wheel.
<br>10:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 一 个 基 路 伯 从 基 路 伯 中 伸 手 到 基 路 伯 中 间 的 火 那 里 ， 取 些 放 在 那 穿 细 麻 衣 的 人 两 手 中 ， 那 人 就 拿 出 去 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it, and went out.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And stretching out his hand to the fire which was between the winged ones, he took some of it and went out.
<br>10:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 基 路 伯 翅 膀 之 下 ， 显 出 有 人 手 的 样 式 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand under their wings.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And I saw the form of a man's hands among the winged ones under their wings.
<br>10:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 又 观 看 ， 见 基 路 伯 旁 边 有 四 个 轮 子 。 这 基 路 伯 旁 有 一 个 轮 子 ， 那 基 路 伯 旁 有 一 个 轮 子 ， 每 基 路 伯 都 是 如 此 。 轮 子 的 颜 色 （ 原 文 作 形 状 ） 仿 佛 水 苍 玉 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And looking, I saw four wheels by the side of the winged ones, one wheel by the side of a winged one and another wheel by the side of another: and the wheels were like the colour of a beryl stone to the eye.
<br>10:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;至 于 四 轮 的 形 状 ， 都 是 一 个 样 式 ， 仿 佛 轮 中 套 轮 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;In form the four of them were all the same, they seemed like a wheel inside a wheel.
<br>10:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;轮 行 走 的 时 候 ， 向 四 方 都 能 直 行 ， 并 不 掉 转 。 头 向 何 方 ， 他 们 也 随 向 何 方 ， 行 走 的 时 候 并 不 掉 转 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;When they were moving, they went on their four sides without turning; they went after the head in the direction in which it was looking; they went without turning.
<br>10:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 全 身 ， 连 背 带 手 和 翅 膀 ， 并 轮 周 围 都 满 了 眼 睛 。 这 四 个 基 路 伯 的 轮 子 都 是 如 此 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the edges of the four wheels were full of eyes round about.
<br>10:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;至 于 这 些 轮 子 ， 我 耳 中 听 见 说 是 旋 转 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;As for the wheels, they were named in my hearing, the circling wheels.
<br>10:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;基 路 伯 各 有 四 脸 ， 第 一 是 基 路 伯 的 脸 ， 第 二 是 人 的 脸 ， 第 三 是 狮 子 的 脸 ， 第 四 是 鹰 的 脸 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a winged one, and the second was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
<br>10:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;基 路 伯 升 上 去 了 。 这 是 我 在 迦 巴 鲁 河 边 所 见 的 活 物 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the winged ones went up on high: this is the living being which I saw by the river Chebar.
<br>10:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;基 路 伯 行 走 ， 轮 也 在 旁 边 行 走 。 基 路 伯 展 开 翅 膀 ， 离 地 上 升 ， 轮 也 不 转 离 他 们 旁 边 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the winged ones went, the wheels went by their side: and when their wings were lifted to take them up from the earth, the wheels were not turned from their side.
<br>10:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 些 站 住 ， 这 些 也 站 住 。 那 些 上 升 ， 这 些 也 一 同 上 升 ， 因 为 活 物 的 灵 在 轮 中 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these lifted up themselves also: for the spirit of the living creature was in them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;When they were at rest in their place, these were at rest; when they were lifted up, these went up with them: for the spirit of life was in them.
<br>10:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 和 华 的 荣 耀 从 殿 的 门 槛 那 里 出 去 ， 停 在 基 路 伯 以 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubims.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then the glory of the Lord went out from the doorstep of the house, and came to rest over the winged ones.
<br>10:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;基 路 伯 出 去 的 时 候 ， 就 展 开 翅 膀 ， 在 我 眼 前 离 地 上 升 。 轮 也 在 他 们 的 旁 边 ， 都 停 在 耶 和 华 殿 的 东 门 口 。 在 他 们 以 上 有 以 色 列 神 的 荣 耀 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also were beside them, and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD's house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the winged ones, lifting up their wings, went up from the earth before my eyes, with the wheels by their side: and they came to rest at the east doorway of the Lord's house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them on high.
<br>10:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 是 我 在 迦 巴 鲁 河 边 所 见 ， 以 色 列 神 荣 耀 以 下 的 活 物 ， 我 就 知 道 他 们 是 基 路 伯 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubims.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;This is the living being which I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and it was clear to me that they were the winged ones.
<br>10:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;各 有 四 个 脸 面 ， 四 个 翅 膀 ， 翅 膀 以 下 有 人 手 的 样 式 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Every one had four faces and every one had four wings; and hands like a man's hands were under their wings.
<br>10:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;至 于 他 们 脸 的 模 样 ， 并 身 体 的 形 像 ， 是 我 从 前 在 迦 巴 鲁 河 边 所 看 见 的 。 他 们 俱 各 直 往 前 行 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;As for the form of their faces, they were the faces whose form I saw by the river Chebar; when they went, every one of them went straight forward.
