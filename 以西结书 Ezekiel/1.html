<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now it came about in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, while I was by the river Chebar among those who had been made prisoners, that the heavens were made open and I saw visions of God.
<br>1:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;正 是 约 雅 斤 王 被 掳 去 第 五 年 四 月 初 五 日 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;On the fifth day of the month, in the fifth year after King Jehoiachin had been made a prisoner,
<br>1:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 迦 勒 底 人 之 地 ， 迦 巴 鲁 河 边 ， 耶 和 华 的 话 特 特 临 到 布 西 的 儿 子 祭 司 以 西 结 。 耶 和 华 的 灵 （ 原 文 作 手 ） 降 在 他 身 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The word of the Lord came to me, Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldaeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the Lord was on me there.
<br>1:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 观 看 ， 见 狂 风 从 北 方 刮 来 ， 随 着 有 一 朵 包 括 闪 烁 火 的 大 云 ， 周 围 有 光 辉 。 从 其 中 的 火 内 发 出 好 像 光 耀 的 精 金 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And, looking, I saw a storm-wind coming out of the north, a great cloud with flames of fire coming after one another, and a bright light shining round about it and in the heart of it was something coloured like electrum.
<br>1:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 从 其 中 显 出 四 个 活 物 的 形 像 来 。 他 们 的 形 状 是 这 样 ， 有 人 的 形 像 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And in the heart of it were the forms of four living beings. And this was what they were like; they had the form of a man.
<br>1:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;各 有 四 个 脸 面 ， 四 个 翅 膀 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.
<br>1:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 的 腿 是 直 的 ， 脚 掌 好 像 牛 犊 之 蹄 ， 都 灿 烂 如 光 明 的 铜 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And their feet were straight feet; and the under sides of their feet were like the feet of oxen; and they were shining like polished brass.
<br>1:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 四 面 的 翅 膀 以 下 有 人 的 手 。 这 四 个 活 物 的 脸 和 翅 膀 乃 是 这 样 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they had the hands of a man under their wings; the four of them had faces on their four sides.
<br>1:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;翅 膀 彼 此 相 接 ， 行 走 并 不 转 身 ， 俱 各 直 往 前 行 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;They went without turning, every one went straight forward.
<br>1:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;至 于 脸 的 形 像 ， 前 面 各 有 人 的 脸 ， 右 面 各 有 狮 子 的 脸 ， 左 面 各 有 牛 的 脸 ， 后 面 各 有 鹰 的 脸 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;As for the form of their faces, they had the face of a man, and the four of them had the face of a lion on the right side, and the four of them had the face of an ox on the left side, and the four of them had the face of an eagle.
<br>1:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;各 展 开 上 边 的 两 个 翅 膀 相 接 ， 各 以 下 边 的 两 个 翅 膀 遮 体 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And their wings were separate at the top; two of the wings of every one were joined one to another, and two were covering their bodies.
<br>1:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 俱 各 直 往 前 行 。 灵 往 哪 里 去 ， 他 们 就 往 那 里 去 ， 行 走 并 不 转 身 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Every one of them went straight forward; wherever the spirit was to go they went; they went on without turning.
<br>1:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;至 于 四 活 物 的 形 像 ， 就 如 烧 着 火 炭 的 形 状 ， 又 如 火 把 的 形 状 。 火 在 四 活 物 中 间 上 去 下 来 ， 这 火 有 光 辉 ， 从 火 中 发 出 闪 电 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And between the living beings it was like burning coals of fire, as if flames were going one after the other between the living beings; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went thunder-flames.
<br>1:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 活 物 往 来 奔 走 ， 好 像 电 光 一 闪 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the living beings went out and came back as quickly as a thunder-flame.
<br>1:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 正 观 看 活 物 的 时 候 ， 见 活 物 的 脸 旁 各 有 一 轮 在 地 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now while I was looking at the four living beings, I saw one wheel on the earth, by the side of the living beings, for the four of them.
<br>1:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;轮 的 形 状 和 颜 色 （ 原 文 作 作 法 ） 好 像 水 苍 玉 。 四 轮 都 是 一 个 样 式 ， 形 状 和 作 法 好 像 轮 中 套 轮 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The form of the wheels and their work was like a beryl; the four of them had the same form and design, and they were like a wheel inside a wheel.
<br>1:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;轮 行 走 的 时 候 ， 向 四 方 都 能 直 行 ， 并 不 掉 转 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The four of them went straight forward without turning to one side.
<br>1:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;至 于 轮 辋 ， 高 而 可 畏 。 四 个 轮 辋 周 围 满 有 眼 睛 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And I saw that they had edges, and their edges, even of the four, were full of eyes round about.
<br>1:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;活 物 行 走 ， 轮 也 在 旁 边 行 走 。 活 物 从 地 上 升 ， 轮 也 都 上 升 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the living beings went on, the wheels went by their side; and when the living beings were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.
<br>1:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;灵 往 哪 里 去 ， 活 物 就 往 那 里 去 。 活 物 上 升 ， 轮 也 在 活 物 旁 边 上 升 ， 因 为 活 物 的 灵 在 轮 中 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Wherever the spirit was to go they went; and the wheels were lifted up by their side: for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels.
<br>1:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 些 行 走 ， 这 些 也 行 走 。 那 些 站 住 ， 这 些 也 站 住 。 那 些 从 地 上 升 ， 轮 也 在 旁 边 上 升 ， 因 为 活 物 的 灵 在 轮 中 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;When these went on, the others went; and when these came to rest, the others came to rest; and when these were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up by their side: for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels.
<br>1:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;活 物 的 头 以 上 有 穹 苍 的 形 像 ， 看 着 像 可 畏 的 水 晶 ， 铺 张 在 活 物 的 头 以 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And over the heads of the living beings there was the form of an arch, looking like ice, stretched out over their heads on high.
<br>1:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;穹 苍 以 下 ， 活 物 的 翅 膀 直 张 ， 彼 此 相 对 。 每 活 物 有 两 个 翅 膀 遮 体 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Under the arch their wings were straight, one stretched out to another: every one had two wings covering their bodies on this side and two covering their bodies on that side.
<br>1:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;活 物 行 走 的 时 候 ， 我 听 见 翅 膀 的 响 声 ， 像 大 水 的 声 音 ， 像 全 能 者 的 声 音 ， 也 像 军 队 哄 嚷 的 声 音 。 活 物 站 住 的 时 候 ， 便 将 翅 膀 垂 下 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when they went, the sound of their wings was like the sound of great waters to my ears, like the voice of the Ruler of all, a sound like the rushing of an army: when they came to rest they let down their wings.
<br>1:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 他 们 头 以 上 的 穹 苍 之 上 有 声 音 。 他 们 站 住 的 时 候 ， 便 将 翅 膀 垂 下 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And there was a voice from the top of the arch which was over their heads: when they came to rest they let down their wings.
<br>1:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 他 们 头 以 上 的 穹 苍 之 上 有 宝 座 的 形 像 ， 仿 佛 蓝 宝 石 。 在 宝 座 形 像 以 上 有 仿 佛 人 的 形 状 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And on the top of the arch which was over their heads was the form of a king's seat, like a sapphire stone; and on the form of the seat was the form of a man seated on it on high.
<br>1:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 见 从 他 腰 以 上 有 仿 佛 光 耀 的 精 金 ， 周 围 都 有 火 的 形 状 ， 又 见 从 他 腰 以 下 有 仿 佛 火 的 形 状 ， 周 围 也 有 光 辉 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And I saw it coloured like electrum, with the look of fire in it and round it, going up from what seemed to be the middle of his body; and going down from what seemed to be the middle of his body I saw what was like fire, and there was a bright light shining round him.
<br>1:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;下 雨 的 日 子 ， 云 中 虹 的 形 状 怎 样 ， 周 围 光 辉 的 形 状 也 是 怎 样 。 这 就 是 耶 和 华 荣 耀 的 形 像 。 我 一 看 见 就 俯 伏 在 地 ， 又 听 见 一 位 说 话 的 声 音 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Like the bow in the cloud on a day of rain, so was the light shining round him. And this is what the glory of the Lord was like. And when I saw it I went down on my face, and the voice of one talking came to my ears.
