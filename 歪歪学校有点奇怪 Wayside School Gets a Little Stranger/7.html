"Good morning, boys and girls."
<br> 
<br> There was the usual pause.
<br> 
<br> "Today I want to talk about doors," said Mr. Kidswatter.
<br> 
<br> "This should be interesting," said Mrs. Jewls.
<br> 
<br> "Do you know how many doors there are in this school building?" asked Mr. Kidswatter.
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Jewls shook her head.
<br> 
<br> "Well, there are a lot! Over thirty! And some of you probably have doors at home too. Maybe more than one. All those doors. Think about it."
<br> 
<br> "Well, Mr, Kidswatter has certainly given us something to think about this morning," said Mrs, Jewls.
<br> 
<br> "So remember," said Mr. Kidswatter. "And please be careful! Always check to see if a door is open before going through it. And if it's not open, open it. If you can't open it yourself, ask someone to open it for you. This may not make a lot of sense to you now, but someday you'll thank me."
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Jewls looked around the class. "That's good advice," she said. "I think most of you already knew it, but at least it's nice to know we have a principal who cares."
<br> 
<br> "I hate doors!" shouted Mr. Kidswatter. "It's a dumb word. Door. Door. Door. Who made up that word, anyway?"
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Jewls waited a little longer, but Mr. Kidswatter seemed to be finished. "Some people just don't like doors," she said.
<br> 
<br> "I have made a new rule!" declared Mr. Kidswatter. "You may no longer say that word. You know what word I mean-but don't say it! Instead, I have made up a new word for you: 'Goozack.' Open the goozack. Shut the goozack. Lock the goozack. Don't you think that's a better word? I do. From now on, that other word is a bad word. I have made my decision."
<br> 
<br> Everyone turned around and looked at the goozack.
<br> 
<br> Suddenly it opened.
<br> 
<br> Todd entered. "I'm sorry I'm late," he said.
<br> 
<br> "That's okay," said Mrs. Jewls. "I'm just glad you're not sick or hurt."
<br> 
<br> "My dad locked his keys in the car," Todd explained. "We had to use a coat hanger to unlock the door."
<br> 
<br> Everyone gasped.
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Jewls made Todd write his name on the blackboard under the word DISCIPLINE.

<br> And the children were having A small celebration.
