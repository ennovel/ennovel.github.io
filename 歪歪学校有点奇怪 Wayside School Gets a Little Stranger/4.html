Rondi loved anything purple.
<br> 
<br> "You can't do purple," said Allison. "I'm doing it."
<br> 
<br> "So?" said Rondi. "Mrs. Jewls didn't say two people couldn't do the same color."
<br> 
<br> "But purple is my favorite color in the world," said Allison.
<br> 
<br> Rondi and Allison were best friends, but Allison always got her way.
<br> 
<br> Rondi switched to blue.
<br> 
<br> Joe raised his hand. "I don't know what rhymes with red," he said.
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Jewls gave him a few suggestions. "Bed, led, wed. Think of words that end in 'e-d.' "
<br> 
<br> "Oh, I get it!" said Joe. He set to work.
<br> 
<br> Rondi tried to think of words that rhymed with blue. She raised her hand. "Mrs. Jewls!" she said. "I chose blue. Can I rhyme that with zoo?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, that would be a good rhyme," agreed Mrs. Jewls.
<br> 
<br> "How about glue?" asked Rondi.
<br> 
<br> "Yes, that rhymes too," said Mrs. Jewls.
<br> 
<br> "Oh, I know!" said Rondi. "How about stew?"
<br> 
<br> "Just pick one and get started," said Mrs. Jewls.
<br> 
<br> Rondi smiled. "This is fun," she told Allison. "There are lots of words that rhyme with blue."
<br> 
<br> Allison grunted.
<br> 
<br> Nothing rhymed with purple. In her mind, Allison had gone through every letter of the alphabet: aurple, burple, curple, durple... all the way to zurple.
<br> 
<br> But after making a big stink over it with Rondi, she couldn't switch colors now.
<br> 
<br> Rondi was just about to start her poem when she got an even better idea: Love That's True. "Poets are always writing about Love That's True, aren't they, Mrs. Jewls?"
<br> 
<br> "Sometimes," said Mrs. Jewls.
<br> 
<br> Rondi smiled. Except she really didn't know much about true love.
<br> 
<br> "Morning dew!" she said. "Poets write about morning dew too, don't they, Mrs. Jewls?"
<br> 
<br> "I believe so," said Mrs. Jewls.
<br> 
<br> Dana walked to Mrs. Jewls's desk. "I can't think of anything that rhymes with pink," she complained.
<br> 
<br> "I'm sure you'll think of something," said Mrs. Jewls. She winked at her.
<br> 
<br> "I can't think," said Dana. "My mind's on the blink. I'm no good at poetry. I stink!"
<br> 
<br> "Just keep trying," said Mrs. Jewls.
<br> 
<br> Dana returned to her seat. She started to put her name on her paper, but her pen wouldn't write. "Great!" she complained. "Now my pen's out of ink!"
<br> 
<br> "Hey, Dana," whispered John. "Do you want to borrow my pen?"
<br> 
<br> "Sure," said Dana.
<br> 
<br> "Too bad, I'm using it," said John. Then he and Joe cracked up.
<br> 
<br> Meanwhile, Allison was going through the alphabet for the tenth time. . . . Murple, nurple, ourple, qurple, . . . she thought.
<br> 
<br> "My left shoe!" exclaimed Rondi.
<br> 
<br> "You better choose something, Rondi, and get started," advised Mrs. Jewls.
<br> 
<br> "I got it!" said Rondi. "A Bird That Flew!"
<br> 
<br> At the end of the day, the children turned in their poems.
<br> 
<br> Yellow
<br> 
<br> by Kathy
<br> 
<br> I don't feel too well, oh I don't know who to tell, oh I'm sick and I smell, oh My barf is yellow
<br> 
<br> Green
<br> 
<br> by Stephen
<br> 
<br> The swimming pool has lots of chlorine. It turned my hair green.
<br> 
<br> Brown
<br> 
<br> by Joy
<br> 
<br> At the circus I saw a clown.
<br> 
<br> On his face was a great big frown.
<br> 
<br> His sad eyes were big and brown.
<br> 
<br> Red
<br> 
<br> by Joe
<br> 
<br> The fire truck is red!
<br> 
<br> It hurried!
<br> 
<br> The siren wailed!
<br> 
<br> The house burned!
<br> 
<br> The firemen saved
<br> 
<br> The baby who screamed.
<br> 
<br> Pink
<br> 
<br> by Dana
<br> 
<br> My favorite color is pink. John is a ratfink!
<br> 16
<br> Purple
<br> 
<br> by Allison
<br> 
<br> The baby won't stop crying.
<br> 
<br> His face is turning purple.
<br> 
<br> Will anything make him feel better?
<br> 
<br> I bet a burp'll.
<br> 
<br> Blue
<br> 
<br> by Rondi
<br> 
<br> That was as far as she got.
