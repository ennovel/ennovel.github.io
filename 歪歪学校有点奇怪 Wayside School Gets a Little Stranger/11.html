<br> 
<br> They couldn't take any chances. Mr. Gorf might walk through the door any moment. Or maybe he was already there, hiding in the coat closet, just waiting for someone to do something wrong.
<br> 
<br> "I didn't want to come today," whispered Calvin. "But my parents made me."
<br> 
<br> "Sh!" said Bebe. "He might hear you."
<br> 
<br> Mr. Kidswatter's voice came over the PA system. "Good morning, boys and girls."
<br> 
<br> "Good morning, Mr. Kidswatter," the children all answered together, like good little boys and girls.
<br> 
<br> They listened attentively to their principal. Then, when Mr. Kidswatter was finished, they took out their arithmetic books and started working.
<br> 
<br> After that, they did social studies, reading, and spelling.
<br> 
<br> When the recess bell rang, the children put their books neatly in their desks, quietly lined up, and walked out of the room and down the stairs.
<br> 
<br> "So how's your substitute teacher?" asked Louis, out on the playground.
<br> 
<br> "Tough!" said Bebe. "I've never worked so hard in my life."
<br> 
<br> "I did more work before ten o'clock than most people do in a day," said Calvin.
<br> 
<br> "But he's very fair," Myron quickly added, just in case Mr. Gorf was listening. He might have been hiding in the bushes.
<br> 
<br> "Yes, he's nice and fair and a very good teacher," said Jenny.
<br> 
<br> "Very smart too," said Deedee. "We're lucky to have him."
<br> 
<br> Louis twisted the end of his mustache between his fingers.
<br> 
<br> After recess the children returned to class and worked until lunchtime. At lunch they ate all the food Miss Mush served them. Their manners were perfect.
<br> 
<br> Mr. Gorf might have been hiding under the table.
<br> 
<br> After lunch they returned to class and practiced their handwriting.
<br> 
<br> Myron looked around. All of a sudden he got a terrible urge to do something. Anything!
<br> 
<br> "Ugga bugga," he said.
<br> 
<br> Jenny put her finger to her lips.
<br> 
<br> "Biff. Boff. Boof!" said Myron, a little louder.
<br> 
<br> "Sh!" said Jenny.
<br> 
<br> Myron stood up. "No!" he shouted. "I don't have to be quiet!"
<br> 
<br> Everyone tried to get Myron to hush up.
