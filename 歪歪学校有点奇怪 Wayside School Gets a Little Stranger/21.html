<br> 
<br> Jane groaned as she threw her suitcase into a motorboat Then she pulled herself aboard and started the engine.
<br> 
<br> "Darling, come back!" Sham shouted from the deck as he watched the boat sputter across the water.
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Drazil climbed into an old rowboat. "I'll find you, Jane Smith!" she shouted into the darkness. "You can run, but you can't hide!"
<br> 
<br> Jane's voice echoed back across the black water. "Rub a monkeeee's ... tumm-mmy... with .. . yourrr ... heaaaaaaaaaa ..."
<br> 
<br> And neither of them was ever seen again.
<br> 123
<br> Wendy had three. Ears, I mean.
<br> 
<br> She had one ear on each side of her head, just like most people. But she also had a third ear, which lay flat on top of her head.
<br> 
<br> You couldn't see it. It was completely covered by her thick, frizzy brown hair.
<br> 
<br> She was an intelligent and lovely young woman. She was gentle and kind.
<br> 
<br> At least, she used to be. Then she met Xavier and became evil and wicked, but I'll get to that later.
<br> 124
<br> She lived in a small apartment in the big city. She always kept fresh flowers in the vase on her kitchen table.
<br> 
<br> She didn't have any friends. She was afraid someone might find out about her ear. She was very embarrassed by it.
<br> 
<br> The one on top of her head, I mean. The other two ears were pretty, as ears go.
<br> 
<br> Actually, the third ear wasn't ugly. In fact, it looked just like her other two.
<br> 
<br> It was quantity, not quality, that bothered her.
<br> 
<br> Then she met Xavier.
<br> 
<br> It was at a museum. They happened to be standing next to each other looking at the same painting. The Mona Lisa.
<br> 
<br> A guard stood by to make sure they didn't touch it.
<br> 
<br> Xavier was very handsome. But he was frightfully shy. He was afraid of women.
<br> 
<br> "That's a beautiful painting, isn't it?" said Wendy.
<br> 
<br> Xavier blushed. He wanted to speak, but his mouth locked shut with fear. It took all his courage just to nod his head.
<br> 
<br> But Wendy knew he liked her.
<br> 
<br> Because there was something else about her ear I haven't told you yet. The one on top of her head, I mean.
<br> 
<br> It didn't hear normal sounds. It heard people's brains,
<br> 
<br> Wendy was able to listen to Xavier's secret thoughts. And this is what she heard.
<br> 
<br> Yes, the painting is very beautiful. But you are more beautiful than the Mona Lisa. I wish somebody would paint your picture. I would buy it and look at it all day. Alas, if only I had the courage to talk to you.
<br> 
<br> Wendy didn't usually listen to other people's thoughts. She thought it was rude, even though the other people didn't know she was listening.
<br> 
<br> Besides, most people's thoughts were usually boring.
<br> 
<br> Xavier was getting too nervous standing next to her. He moved on to another painting.
<br> 
<br> Wendy followed him.
<br> 
<br> She listened to the lonely man's thoughts. They weren't boring at all. Most of his thoughts were about her, but she also learned a few other things. He liked to read. His favorite author was Charles Dickens. He loved animals, especially dogs.
<br> 
<br> "That painting reminds me of a book," said Wendy. "A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens. Have you read it?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes!" Xavier blurted, a little too loudly. "It's my favorite book! I've read everything Dickens has
<br> 126
<br> written. Twice. My favorite part is when-"
<br> 
<br> He suddenly stopped, very embarrassed.
<br> 
<br> "Please go on," said Wendy.
<br> 
<br> "No, I don't want to bother you," said Xavier.
<br> 
<br> "You're not bothering me," said Wendy. "Charles Dickens is my favorite author. I sometimes read aloud to my dog."
<br> 
<br> "You have a dog?" asked Xavier.
<br> 
<br> Wendy nodded.
<br> 
<br> Xavier stared into her dark eyes. "I love dogs," he said, as his brain said, I love you.
<br> 
<br> Wendy and Xavier spent the afternoon together. He could hardly stop talking.
<br> 
<br> It was like a genie had escaped from a bottle. All the love and emotion that had been buried for so long inside him came pouring out on Wendy.
<br> 
<br> "I don't even know your name," he suddenly blurted.
<br> 
<br> "Wendy Nogard," said Wendy.
<br> 
<br> "I'm Xavier Dalton," said Xavier.
<br> 
<br> They shook hands and made plans to meet again at the museum the following week.
<br> 
<br> On her way home, Wendy stopped by the library and checked out A Tale of Two Cities. Then she went to the pet store and bought a dog.
<br> 
<br> A month later Xavier asked her to marry him.
<br> 
<br> Wendy didn't know what to say. She loved Xavier. And she knew he loved her. But she still hadn't told him about her ear.
<br> 
<br> The one on top of her head, I mean.
<br> 
<br> He knew about the other two. He had nibbled on each of them.
<br> 
<br> "Marriage is a big step," she said. "I'm afraid we haven't known each other long enough."
<br> 
<br> "I've known you long enough to know I could never be happy without you," said Xavier. "Before I met you, Wendy, I was sad and lonely. But I was used to it. Now I can't imagine living like that again. I don't know what I'd do without you."
<br> 
<br> He stroked her hair.
<br> 
<br> "Well, there's one little thing you don't know about me," said Wendy.
<br> 
<br> His hand bumped into it. "What's this thing?" he asked.
<br> 
<br> "That's what I was going to tell you about, dear," said Wendy.
<br> 
<br> Xavier parted Wendy's hair and looked at it. "It's an ear!" he exclaimed.
<br> 
<br> "Yes, it is," said Wendy. "Some people have two ears. I have three. Now that you know, if you still want to marry me, my answer is yes! Yes, sweetheart yes!"
<br> 
<br> "I love you," said Xavier. "That's all that matters to me."
<br> 
<br> That was what he said. But this is what he was thinking.
<br> 128
<br> Oh, gross! You're disgusting! I never want to touch you again! I can't even stand to look at you! You tricked me, you freak! You monster!
<br> 
<br> And of course Wendy heard every word.
<br> 
<br> He stood up. "I'll be right back, sweetheart. I bought you diamond earrings as an engagement present. I just need to run back to the jewelry store and buy one more." He hurried out the door.
<br> 
<br> She never saw him again.
<br> 
<br> I'm sorry to say this story has a sad ending.
<br> 
<br> Xavier, thanks to Wendy, got over his shyness. He went out with lots of women but broke each one's heart. He could never love any of them.
<br> 
<br> There was a hole in his heart. He was in love with Wendy Nogard, but he didn't know it. And so he could never be happy.
<br> 
<br> Wendy became a bitter and evil person. She was unhappy, and she wanted everyone else to be unhappy too.
<br> 
<br> Whenever she heard someone thinking happy thoughts, she would listen closely and then do and say just the right thing to make the person feel rotten.
<br> 
<br> She hated children the most. Every time she passed a playground, she heard them laughing and having fun.
<br> 
<br> So she became a substitute teacher.
