His knees wobbled.
<br> 
<br> The ball bounced off his face. "Cool," he said as blood flowed out of his nose.
<br> 
<br> "That was a world's record, Louis!" exclaimed Eric Ovens.
<br> 
<br> Louis smiled proudly. He turned to look at Miss Nogard, but she had already gone inside,
<br> 
<br> "You like Miss Nogard, don't you?" asked Bebe.
<br> 
<br> "She seems like a nice person," said Louis.
<br> 
<br> "She's pretty too," said Eric Bacon as he nudged Louis in the side.
<br> 
<br> "Well, she is kind of cute," Louis admitted.
<br> 
<br> "Oooooh," said Joy.
<br> 
<br> "But do you love her?" asked Jenny.
<br> 
<br> Everyone giggled. Louis's red face got even redder.
<br> 
<br> "You should ask her out on a date," said Eric Fry.
<br> 
<br> "No, I don't think that's a very good idea," said Louis.
<br> 
<br> "Why not?" asked Eric Ovens. "I think you two would make a real cute couple."
<br> 
<br> "Bring her flowers," said Dana.
<br> 
<br> "Buy her candy," said Maurecia.
<br> 
<br> "Tell her she's got eyes like the moon," said Bebe.
<br> 
<br> "Eyes like the moon?" asked Louis.
<br> 
<br> "Girls love it when you tell them that," said Bebe.
<br> 
<br> "Forget that gushy stuff," said Eric Bacon. "Just walk right up to her and say, 'Hey, baby! How about a date?' "
<br> 
<br> "Just like that?" asked Louis.
<br> 
<br> "This is what you do," said Terrence. "You take her to a real scary movie. And then at the scary part, you put your arm around her."
<br> 
<br> "Ooooh," said Dana and Jenny.
<br> 
<br> "No, take her dancing," said Myron. "And hold her real close."
<br> 
<br> "Ooooooh," said the three Erics.
<br> 
<br> Louis laughed. "You kids are crazy," he said.
<br> 
<br> "You're scared of her, aren't you?" asked Eric Bacon.
<br> 
<br> "You shouldn't be scared," said Eric Ovens. "You're bigger and stronger and faster than anyone on the playground."
<br> 
<br> "And you've got the best mustache too," said Eric Fry.
<br> 
<br> "I'm not afraid of her," Louis tried to explain. "It's just-" He looked up at the very tall school. "Miss Nogard is way-high-up there, and I'm way-down-low
<br> 152
<br> here. You'll understand someday when you're older."
<br> 
<br> He picked up the ball and threw it way high up. It hit somewhere between the eighteenth and twentieth story.
<br> 
<br> And never came down.
<br> 
<br> There was no nineteenth story.
