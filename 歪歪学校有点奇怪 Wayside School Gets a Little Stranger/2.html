He passed out the balls and played with the kids at recess and lunch.
<br> 
<br> When the school closed, the children were sent to other schools. Horrible schools. No two kids were sent to the same school.
<br> 
<br> Louis was afraid he'd cry if he talked to them.
<br> 
<br> But he worked hard. For two hundred and forty-two days, he pushed and pulled, shoveled and mopped. He never left the building. At night he slept on the couch in the teachers' lounge on the twelfth floor.
<br> 
<br> Some days it seemed hopeless. The worst part was the smell. He often had to run and stick his head out a window to get a breath of fresh air. But whenever he felt like quitting, he thought about those poor kids, stuck in those horrible schools, and he just worked harder.
<br> 
<br> And at last, two hundred and forty-three days later, the school was ready to open.
<br> 
<br> Well, almost ready. There was one little problem.
<br> 
<br> Suddenly, from somewhere inside the building, or maybe just inside his head, Louis heard a loud "moo."
<br> 
<br> He put his hands over his ears and said, "I don't hear it, I don't hear it, I don't hear it" until the mooing stopped.
<br> 
<br> He had scrubbed and polished every inch of Wayside School. There were no cows anywhere. He was sure of it! Still, every once in a while, he heard something go "moo." Or at least he thought he did.
<br> 
<br> He took the sign off the door.
<br> 
<br> But before you enter, you should know something about Wayside School.
<br> 
<br> Wayside School is a thirty-story building with one room on each floor, except there is no nineteenth story.
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Jewls teaches the class on the thirtieth story.
<br> 
<br> Miss Zarves teaches the class on the nineteenth story. There is no Miss Zarves.
<br> 
<br> Understand?
<br> 
<br> Good; explain it to me.
<br> 
<br> "Louis!" someone shouted.
<br> 
<br> He turned to see a red and blue overcoat
<br> 4
<br> running toward him. "Hi, Sharie!" he said. He couldn't see her face, but he knew she had to be somewhere inside the coat.
<br> 
<br> Sharie jumped into his arms.
<br> 
<br> "I bet you're glad to be back," said Louis.
<br> 
<br> "You bet!" said Sharie. "Now I can finally get some sleep!"
<br> 
<br> All around the playground, old friends were getting back together.
<br> 
<br> "Hi, old pal!" said John.
<br> 
<br> "Hey, good buddy," said Joe.
<br> 
<br> "Bebe!" yelled Calvin from one side of the playground.
<br> 
<br> "Calvin!" shouted Bebe from the other.
<br> 
<br> They ran and smashed into each other.
<br> 
<br> "Hi, Eric, good to see you," said Eric.
<br> 
<br> "Hey, good to see you too," said Eric. "Oh, look. There's Eric!"
<br> 
<br> "Hi, Eric! Hi, Eric!"
<br> 
<br> "Hi, Eric."
<br> 
<br> "Hi, Eric."
<br> 
<br> Even Kathy said hello to everybody.
<br> 
<br> "Hey, Big Ears!" she said to Myron as she slapped him on the back. "What's happ'nin', Smelly?" she asked Dameon. "You didn't take a bath for two hundred and forty-three days, did you? Hi, Allison. Did you get uglier while you were
<br> 
<br> away, or were you always this ugly and I just forgot?"
<br> 
<br> "That's a nice sweater, Kathy," said Allison, who always tried to say something nice.
<br> 
<br> Kathy moved on to Terrence. "I'm sure glad to see you, Terrence!" she said.
<br> 
<br> "You are?" asked Terrence.
<br> 
<br> "Yes," said Kathy. "I thought you'd be in jail by now."
<br> 
<br> Todd came running across the playground.
<br> 
<br> "Hi, Todd!" shouted Sharie, right in Louis's ear.
<br> 
<br> Todd kept running.
<br> 
<br> "Hey, Todd!" called Jason. "Good to see you!"
<br> 
<br> "Hi, Todd!" called Myron and D. J.
<br> 
<br> But Todd didn't answer. He just kept running until he reached the school building.
<br> 
<br> Then he kissed Wayside School.
<br> 
<br> Out of all the schools, Todd had been sent to the very worst one. It was awful! The first thing he had to do every morning was-
<br> 
<br> Wait a second. I don't have to tell you. You already know.
<br> 
<br> Todd was sent to your school.
