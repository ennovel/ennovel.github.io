<br> 
<br> By the blackboards with pride: Snowmen, and mooses,
<br> 
<br> And a joyful sleigh ride.
<br> 
<br> They ate homemade cookies, (Red and green ones, of course.)
<br> 
<br> When Kathy declared,
<br> 
<br> "I don't believe in Santa Claus!"
<br> 
<br> She just opened her mouth,
<br> 
<br> And said what she said. "Santa Claus isn't real,
<br> 
<br> And besides that, he's dead!
<br> 
<br> "So you bet I will pout,
<br> 
<br> And you bet I will cry. "You bet I will shout,
<br> 
<br> I'm telling you why. . . ."
<br> 
<br> Stephen covered his ears. "No, you're wrong!" he shouted. "It's not true. There is a Santa Claus. I know there is!"
<br> 
<br> "Ho, ho, ho," laughed Kathy.
<br> 
<br> "Kathy is just saying that because she never gets any presents," said Jason.
<br> 
<br> "All she ever gets is a lump of coal!" said Rondi.
<br> 
<br> "Wrong!" said Kathy. "I get lots of presents. My parents buy them for me. They have lots of money. They buy me anything I want."
<br> 
<br> She bit off the head of a reindeer cookie. "The
<br> 40
<br> only thing that matters is how rich your parents are. If they have lots of money, then you'll get lots of good presents. If they're poor, then you'll just get a few crummy presents."
<br> 
<br> Everyone tried to argue with her, but Kathy just asked them all the old questions, like "How does a fat man fit down a skinny chimney?" or "How could he visit everyone's house in the whole world in one night?"
<br> 
<br> And of course nobody knew the answers. Nobody ever has.
<br> 
<br> "Only Santa knows the answers to those questions," said Rondi.
<br> 
<br> "Don't you even like Christmas?" asked Stephen.
<br> 
<br> "Sure," said Kathy.
<br> 
<br> "I get lots of presents, And I don't have to work."
<br> 
<br> Then she stuck out her tongue and called Stephen a jerk.
<br> 
<br> Poor Stephen sputtered As his face turned quite blue,
<br> 
<br> "If you don't believe in Santa, He won't believe in you!"
<br> 
<br> But Kathy just yelped.
<br> 
<br> "You know that it's true! Do you still believe in the Easter bunny.
<br> 
<br> The tooth fairy, and Miss Zarves too?"
<br> 
<br> "Let's ask Mrs. Jewls!" said Maurecia.
<br> 
<br> "She's a teacher who's wise. Let's ask Mrs. Jewls.
<br> 
<br> She never lies!"
<br> 
<br> The children crowded round Their wise teacher's desk
<br> 
<br> And asked her the question Never found on a test.
<br> 
<br> "Is there a Santa?
<br> 
<br> You're a teacher with smarts! Is Santa Claus real?"
<br> 
<br> They asked with pure hearts.
<br> 
<br> And oh, Mrs. Jewls, That teacher so wise,
<br> 
<br> Looked at their faces And bright, eager eyes.
<br> 42
<br> She had to say something.
<br> 
<br> It was her job to reply. "Tell them!" yelped Kathy.
<br> 
<br> "That reindeer can't fly!"
