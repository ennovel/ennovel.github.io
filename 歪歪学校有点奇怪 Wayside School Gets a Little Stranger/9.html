<br> 
<br> Snowflakes were falling. Inside the window
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Jewls was stalling.
<br> 
<br> "Are our parents all liars?"
<br> 
<br> "Is it all just a trick
<br> 
<br> To make us be good For fear of St. Nick?"
<br> 
<br> "Tell us the truth;
<br> 
<br> Don't try to fake it. Is there a Santa?
<br> 
<br> Let us know; we can take it."
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Jewls cleared her throat, Then she cleared it again.
<br> 
<br> She put down her pencil. She picked up her pen.
<br> 
<br> "Hey, look!" shouted Leslie. "Look there! Who's that? Someone is coming in Through the goozack!"
<br> 
<br> Sure enough, the door opened.
<br> 
<br> It had to open quite wide! As a strange-looking stranger
<br> 
<br> Stepped sideways inside.
<br> 
<br> He wore a red suit
<br> 
<br> And had a white, fluffy beard. And even for Wayside
<br> 
<br> He looked pretty weird!
<br> 
<br> His fat belly shook Like a bowl full of Jell-O.
<br> 
<br> There was no doubt about it. They knew that fellow!
<br> 
<br> It was Louis, the yard teacher.
<br> 
<br> "What are you doing in that stupid suit Louis?" asked Sharie. "Aren't you hot?"
<br> 
<br> "Why are you wearing a fake beard?" asked Todd.
<br> 44
<br> "Is that a pillow under your jacket?" asked Jason.
<br> 
<br> Kathy was delighted. "See!" she said. "That proves there's no Santa Claus! If there was, Louis wouldn't have to dress up like a fool and pretend to be him."
<br> 
<br> "I'm not Louis," said Louis. "I'm Santa Claus. Ho! Ho-"
<br> 
<br> "You're lying to us, Louis," said John. "Everyone is always lying to us. Kathy's right. Christmas is nothing but a dirty, stinking lie!"
<br> 
<br> "I was just trying to bring a little holiday cheer," said Louis.
<br> 
<br> "Go home, Jerome," said Terrence.
<br> 
<br> "Now, that's no way to talk to Louis," said Mrs. Jewls. "Louis is one of Santa's special helpers."
<br> 
<br> "Really, Louis?" asked Deedee.
<br> 
<br> Louis looked at Mrs. Jewls. "That's right," he said.
<br> 
<br> The children were all very impressed.
<br> 
<br> "Have you ever met him?" demanded Kathy.
<br> 
<br> "Well, no, not exactly," Louis admitted.
<br> 
<br> "See!" said Kathy. "It's just another lie."
<br> 
<br> "You don't have to meet Santa to be one of his special helpers," said Mrs. Jewls.
<br> 
<br> "Then how do you know what he wants you to do?" asked John.
<br> 
<br> "That's easy," said Mrs. Jewls. "You just have to be nice to other people. Whenever you give someone a present or sing a holiday song, you're helping Santa Claus. To me, that's what Christmas is all about. Helping Santa Claus!"
<br> 
<br> "Can I be one of his helpers?" asked Dameon.
<br> 
<br> "You bet," said Mrs. Jewls.
<br> 
<br> "Hey, everybody," shouted Dameon. "I'm one of Santa's helpers!"
<br> 
<br> "Me too," said Allison.
<br> 
<br> "There must be a Santa Claus!" cheered Stephen. "Because it feels so good to help him."
<br> 
<br> So the children all helped Santa,
<br> 
<br> In every way they could, By singing songs and giving gifts
<br> 
<br> And just by being good.
<br> 
<br> "But there is no Santa Claus!"
<br> 
<br> Kathy continued to yelp.
<br> 
<br> "Well, if that's the case," said Mrs. Jewls.
<br> 
<br> "He must really need our help."
