She looked at all the bright and chipper faces. She knew by the end of the day they would no longer be bright and chipper.
<br> 
<br> They would be glum and blah.
<br> 
<br> She smiled at the class. "Good morning, everybody," she said. "My name is Miss Nogard."
<br> 
<br> She listened to their brains.
<br> 
<br> Calvin had spilled orange juice on his lap during breakfast and worried that someone might
<br> 130
<br> think he had gone to the bathroom in his pants.
<br> 
<br> Dana had gotten her hair cut yesterday, and she thought it was too short. She was afraid it made her look like a boy. She was especially sensitive to this because Dana was sometimes a boy's name.
<br> 
<br> Jason was mad at his older brother, Justin. Justin was in high school. Justin always got good grades and was a star in everything he did. Compared to Justin, Jason felt like a loser. "What's so great about high school?" he had asked this morning. "My school is higher than yours!"
<br> 
<br> D. J. had heard a song on the radio on his way to school. He hated the song! But it kept playing over and over again in his head.
<br> 
<br> Bebe had an itch on her leg.
<br> 
<br> Miss Nogard smiled. The bad stuff always rose to the top of the brain.
<br> 
<br> Even if a person was very excited about something wonderful, the person still worried about what could go wrong.
<br> 
<br> Jenny was going horseback riding after school, if it didn't rain. She had never gone horseback riding before. She hoped she wouldn't fall off the horse.
<br> 
<br> Miss Nogard clapped her hands. "So, who would like to tell me what you've been working on?" she asked.
<br> 
<br> A few hands went up in the air.
<br> 
<br> "Oooh! Oooh!" said Mac.
<br> 
<br> "How about the boy in the orange and purple shirt?" said Miss Nogard.
<br> 
<br> Everyone looked around.
<br> 
<br> "The handsome young man sitting right there," said Miss Nogard.
<br> 
<br> Dana looked at her shirt. It was orange and purple. She pointed at herself and mouthed the word me?
<br> 
<br> "Yes, you," said Miss Nogard.
<br> 
<br> Dana's face turned red-hot. "I'm a girl," she said.
<br> 
<br> Everyone laughed.
<br> 
<br> "Oh, I am so embarrassed!" said Miss Nogard, with her hand over her heart.
<br> 
<br> "It's not your fault," said Dana. "It's my stupid haircut. I hate it!"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, no," said Miss Nogard. "You look adorable. I see now you're a very pretty girl."
<br> 
<br> "I'm ugly," muttered Dana. She buried her head under her arms.
<br> 
<br> "I'd better call on someone else," said Miss Nogard.
<br> 
<br> Suddenly, out of nowhere, a brain screamed, Don't call on me! Whatever you do, please don't call on me!
