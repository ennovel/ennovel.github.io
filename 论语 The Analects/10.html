<p>　　When he was in the prince's ancestral temple, or in the court, hespoke minutely on every point, but cautiously.</p> 
<p>　　When he was waiting at court, in speaking with the great officersof the lower grade, he spoke freely, but in a straightforward manner;in speaking with those of the higher grade, he did so blandly, butprecisely.</p> 
<p>　　When the ruler was present, his manner displayed respectful uneasiness;it was grave, but self-possessed.</p> 
<p>　　When the prince called him to employ him in the reception of a visitor,his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to move forward withdifficulty.</p> 
<p>　　He inclined himself to the other officers among whom he stood, movinghis left or right arm, as their position required, but keeping theskirts of his robe before and behind evenly adjusted.</p> 
<p>　　He hastened forward, with his arms like the wings of a bird.</p> 
<p>　　When the guest had retired, he would report to the prince, "The visitoris not turning round any more."When he entered the palace gate, he seemed to bend his body, as ifit were not sufficient to admit him.</p> 
<p>　　When he was standing, he did not occupy the middle of the gateway;when he passed in or out, he did not tread upon the threshold.</p> 
<p>　　When he was passing the vacant place of the prince, his countenanceappeared to change, and his legs to bend under him, and his wordscame as if he hardly had breath to utter them.</p> 
<p>　　He ascended the reception hall, holding up his robe with both hishands, and his body bent; holding in his breath also, as if he darednot breathe.</p> 
<p>　　When he came out from the audience, as soon as he had descended onestep, he began to relax his countenance, and had a satisfied look.</p> 
<p>　　When he had got the bottom of the steps, he advanced rapidly to hisplace, with his arms like wings, and on occupying it, his manner stillshowed respectful uneasiness.</p> 
<p>　　When he was carrying the scepter of his ruler, he seemed to bend hisbody, as if he were not able to bear its weight. He did not hold ithigher than the position of the hands in making a bow, nor lower thantheir position in giving anything to another. His countenance seemedto change, and look apprehensive, and he dragged his feet along asif they were held by something to the ground.</p> 
<p>　　In presenting the presents with which he was charged, he wore a placidappearance.</p> 
<p>　　At his private audience, he looked highly pleased.</p> 
<p>　　The superior man did not use a deep purple, or a puce color, in theornaments of his dress.</p> 
<p>　　Even in his undress, he did not wear anything of a red or reddishcolor.</p> 
<p>　　In warm weather, he had a single garment either of coarse or finetexture, but he wore it displayed over an inner garment.</p> 
<p>　　Over lamb's fur he wore a garment of black; over fawn's fur one ofwhite; and over fox's fur one of yellow.</p> 
<p>　　The fur robe of his undress was long, with the right sleeve short.</p> 
<p>　　He required his sleeping dress to be half as long again as his body.</p> 
<p>　　When staying at home, he used thick furs of the fox or the badger.</p> 
<p>　　When he put off mourning, he wore all the appendages of the girdle.</p> 
<p>　　His undergarment, except when it was required to be of the curtainshape, was made of silk cut narrow above and wide below.</p> 
<p>　　He did not wear lamb's fur or a black cap on a visit of condolence.</p> 
<p>　　On the first day of the month he put on his court robes, and presentedhimself at court.</p> 
<p>　　When fasting, he thought it necessary to have his clothes brightlyclean and made of linen cloth.</p> 
<p>　　When fasting, he thought it necessary to change his food, and alsoto change the place where he commonly sat in the apartment.</p> 
<p>　　He did not dislike to have his rice finely cleaned, nor to have hismince meat cut quite small.</p> 
<p>　　He did not eat rice which had been injured by heat or damp and turnedsour, nor fish or flesh which was gone. He did not eat what was discolored,or what was of a bad flavor, nor anything which was ill-cooked, orwas not in season.</p> 
<p>　　He did not eat meat which was not cut properly, nor what was servedwithout its proper sauce.</p> 
<p>　　Though there might be a large quantity of meat, he would not allowwhat he took to exceed the due proportion for the rice. It was onlyin wine that he laid down no limit for himself, but he did not allowhimself to be confused by it.</p> 
<p>　　He did not partake of wine and dried meat bought in the market.</p> 
<p>　　He was never without ginger when he ate. He did not eat much.</p> 
<p>　　When he had been assisting at the prince's sacrifice, he did not keepthe flesh which he received overnight. The flesh of his family sacrificehe did not keep over three days. If kept over three days, people couldnot eat it.</p> 
<p>　　When eating, he did not converse. When in bed, he did not speak.</p> 
<p>　　Although his food might be coarse rice and vegetable soup, he wouldoffer a little of it in sacrifice with a grave, respectful air.</p> 
<p>　　If his mat was not straight, he did not sit on it.</p> 
<p>　　When the villagers were drinking together, upon those who carriedstaffs going out, he also went out immediately after.</p> 
<p>　　When the villagers were going through their ceremonies to drive awaypestilential influences, he put on his court robes and stood on theeastern steps.</p> 
<p>　　When he was sending complimentary inquiries to any one in anotherstate, he bowed twice as he escorted the messenger away.</p> 
<p>　　Chi K'ang having sent him a present of physic, he bowed and receivedit, saying, "I do not know it. I dare not taste it."The stable being burned down, when he was at court, on his returnhe said, "Has any man been hurt?" He did not ask about the horses.</p> 
<p>　　When the he would adjust his mat, first taste it, and then give itaway to others. When the prince sent him a gift of undressed meat,he would have it cooked, and offer it to the spirits of his ancestors.</p> 
<p>　　When the prince sent him a gift of a living animal, he would keepit alive.</p> 
<p>　　When he was in attendance on the prince and joining in the entertainment,the prince only sacrificed. He first tasted everything.</p> 
<p>　　When he was ill and the prince came to visit him, he had his headto the east, made his court robes be spread over him, and drew hisgirdle across them.</p> 
<p>　　When the prince's order called him, without waiting for his carriageto be yoked, he went at once.</p> 
<p>　　When he entered the ancestral temple of the state, he asked abouteverything.</p> 
<p>　　When any of his friends died, if he had no relations offices, he wouldsay, "I will bury him."When a friend sent him a present, though it might be a carriage andhorses, he did not bow.</p> 
<p>　　The only present for which he bowed was that of the flesh of sacrifice.</p> 
<p>　　In bed, he did not lie like a corpse. At home, he did not put on anyformal deportment.</p> 
<p>　　When he saw any one in a mourning dress, though it might be an acquaintance,he would change countenance; when he saw any one wearing the cap offull dress, or a blind person, though he might be in his undress,he would salute him in a ceremonious manner.</p> 
<p>　　To any person in mourning he bowed forward to the crossbar of hiscarriage; he bowed in the same way to any one bearing the tables ofpopulation.</p> 
<p>　　When he was at an entertainment where there was an abundance of provisionsset before him, he would change countenance and rise up.</p> 
<p>　　On a sudden clap of thunder, or a violent wind, he would change countenance.</p> 
<p>　　When he was about to mount his carriage, he would stand straight,holding the cord.</p> 
<p>　　When he was in the carriage, he did not turn his head quite round,he did not talk hastily, he did not point with his hands.</p> 
<p>　　Seeing the countenance, it instantly rises. It flies round, and byand by settles.</p> 
<p>　　The Master said, "There is the hen-pheasant on the hill bridge. Atits season! At its season!" Tsze-lu made a motion to it. Thrice itsmelt him and then rose.</p>
