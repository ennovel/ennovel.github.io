<p>　　The Master said, "Extreme is my decay. For a long time, I have notdreamed, as I was wont to do, that I saw the duke of Chau."The Master said, "Let the will be set on the path of duty.</p> 
<p>　　"Let every attainment in what is good be firmly grasped.</p> 
<p>　　"Let perfect virtue be accorded with.</p> 
<p>　　"Let relaxation and enjoyment be found in the polite arts."The Master said, "From the man bringing his bundle of dried fleshfor my teaching upwards, I have never refused instruction to any one."The Master said, "I do not open up the truth to one who is not eagerto get knowledge, nor help out any one who is not anxious to explainhimself. When I have presented one corner of a subject to any one,and he cannot from it learn the other three, I do not repeat my lesson."When the Master was eating by the side of a mourner, he never ateto the full.</p> 
<p>　　He did not sing on the same day in which he had been weeping.</p> 
<p>　　The Master said to Yen Yuan, "When called to office, to undertakeits duties; when not so called, to he retired;-it is only I and youwho have attained to this."Tsze-lu said, "If you had the conduct of the armies of a great state,whom would you have to act with you?"The Master said, "I would not have him to act with me, who will unarmedattack a tiger, or cross a river without a boat, dying without anyregret. My associate must be the man who proceeds to action full ofsolicitude, who is fond of adjusting his plans, and then carries theminto execution."The Master said, "If the search for riches is sure to be successful,though I should become a groom with whip in hand to get them, I willdo so. As the search may not be successful, I will follow after thatwhich I love."The things in reference to which the Master exercised the greatestcaution were-fasting, war, and sickness.</p> 
<p>　　When the Master was in Ch'i, he heard the Shao, and for three monthsdid not know the taste of flesh. "I did not think'" he said, "thatmusic could have been made so excellent as this."Yen Yu said, "Is our Master for the ruler of Wei?" Tsze-kung said,"Oh! I will ask him."He went in accordingly, and said, "What sort of men were Po-i andShu-ch'i?" "They were ancient worthies," said the Master. "Did theyhave any repinings because of their course?" The Master again replied,"They sought to act virtuously, and they did so; what was there forthem to repine about?" On this, Tsze-kung went out and said, "OurMaster is not for him."The Master said, "With coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, andmy bended arm for a pillow;-I have still joy in the midst of thesethings. Riches and honors acquired by unrighteousness, are to me asa floating cloud."The Master said, "If some years were added to my life, I would givefifty to the study of the Yi, and then I might come to be withoutgreat faults."The Master's frequent themes of discourse were-the Odes, the History,and the maintenance of the Rules of Propriety. On all these he frequentlydiscoursed.</p> 
<p>　　The Duke of Sheh asked Tsze-lu about Confucius, and Tsze-lu did notanswer him.</p> 
<p>　　The Master said, "Why did you not say to him,-He is simply a man,who in his eager pursuit of knowledge forgets his food, who in thejoy of its attainment forgets his sorrows, and who does not perceivethat old age is coming on?"The Master said, "I am not one who was born in the possession of knowledge;I am one who is fond of antiquity, and earnest in seeking it there."The subjects on which the Master did not talk, were-extraordinarythings, feats of strength, disorder, and spiritual beings.</p> 
<p>　　The Master said, "When I walk along with two others, they may serveme as my teachers. I will select their good qualities and follow them,their bad qualities and avoid them."The Master said, "Heaven produced the virtue that is in me. Hwan T'ui-whatcan he do to me?"The Master said, "Do you think, my disciples, that I have any concealments?</p> 
<p>　　I conceal nothing from you. There is nothing which I do that is notshown to you, my disciples; that is my way."There were four things which the Master taught,-letters, ethics, devotionof soul, and truthfulness.</p> 
<p>　　The Master said, "A sage it is not mine to see; could I see a manof real talent and virtue, that would satisfy me."The Master said, "A good man it is not mine to see; could I see aman possessed of constancy, that would satisfy me.</p> 
<p>　　"Having not and yet affecting to have, empty and yet affecting tobe full, straitened and yet affecting to be at ease:-it is difficultwith such characteristics to have constancy."The Master angled,-but did not use a net. He shot,-but not at birdsperching.</p> 
<p>　　The Master said, "There may be those who act without knowing why.</p> 
<p>　　I do not do so. Hearing much and selecting what is good and followingit; seeing much and keeping it in memory: this is the second styleof knowledge."It was difficult to talk profitably and reputably with the peopleof Hu-hsiang, and a lad of that place having had an interview withthe Master, the disciples doubted.</p> 
<p>　　The Master said, "I admit people's approach to me without committingmyself as to what they may do when they have retired. Why must onebe so severe? If a man purify himself to wait upon me, I receive himso purified, without guaranteeing his past conduct."The Master said, "Is virtue a thing remote? I wish to be virtuous,and lo! virtue is at hand."The minister of crime of Ch'an asked whether the duke Chao knew propriety,and Confucius said, "He knew propriety."Confucius having retired, the minister bowed to Wu-ma Ch'i to comeforward, and said, "I have heard that the superior man is not a partisan.</p> 
<p>　　May the superior man be a partisan also? The prince married a daughterof the house of WU, of the same surname with himself, and called her,-'Theelder Tsze of Wu.' If the prince knew propriety, who does not knowit?"Wu-ma Ch'i reported these remarks, and the Master said, "I am fortunate!</p> 
<p>　　If I have any errors, people are sure to know them."When the Master was in company with a person who was singing, if hesang well, he would make him repeat the song, while he accompaniedit with his own voice.</p> 
<p>　　The Master said, "In letters I am perhaps equal to other men, butthe character of the superior man, carrying out in his conduct whathe professes, is what I have not yet attained to."The Master said, "The sage and the man of perfect virtue;-how dareI rank myself with them? It may simply be said of me, that I striveto become such without satiety, and teach others without weariness."Kung-hsi Hwa said, "This is just what we, the disciples, cannot imitateyou in."The Master being very sick, Tsze-lu asked leave to pray for him. Hesaid, "May such a thing be done?" Tsze-lu replied, "It may. In theEulogies it is said, 'Prayer has been made for thee to the spiritsof the upper and lower worlds.'" The Master said, "My praying hasbeen for a long time."The Master said, "Extravagance leads to insubordination, and parsimonyto meanness. It is better to be mean than to be insubordinate."The Master said, "The superior man is satisfied and composed; themean man is always full of distress."The Master was mild, and yet dignified; majestic, and yet not fierce;respectful, and yet easy.</p>
