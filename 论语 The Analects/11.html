<p>　　"If I have occasion to use those things, I follow the men of formertimes."The Master said, "Of those who were with me in Ch'an and Ts'ai, thereare none to be found to enter my door."Distinguished for their virtuous principles and practice, there wereYen Yuan, Min Tsze-ch'ien, Zan Po-niu, and Chung-kung; for their abilityin speech, Tsai Wo and Tsze-kung; for their administrative talents,Zan Yu and Chi Lu; for their literary acquirements, Tsze-yu and Tsze-hsia.</p> 
<p>　　The Master said, "Hui gives me no assistance. There is nothing thatI say in which he does not delight."The Master said, "Filial indeed is Min Tsze-ch'ien! Other people saynothing of him different from the report of his parents and brothers."Nan Yung was frequently repeating the lines about a white scepterstone. Confucius gave him the daughter of his elder brother to wife.</p> 
<p>　　Chi K'ang asked which of the disciples loved to learn. Confucius repliedto him, "There was Yen Hui; he loved to learn. Unfortunately his appointedtime was short, and he died. Now there is no one who loves to learn,as he did."When Yen Yuan died, Yen Lu begged the carriage of the Master to selland get an outer shell for his son's coffin.</p> 
<p>　　The Master said, "Every one calls his son his son, whether he hastalents or has not talents. There was Li; when he died, he had a coffinbut no outer shell. I would not walk on foot to get a shell for him,because, having followed in the rear of the great officers, it wasnot proper that I should walk on foot."When Yen Yuan died, the Master said, "Alas! Heaven is destroying me!</p> 
<p>　　Heaven is destroying me!"When Yen Yuan died, the Master bewailed him exceedingly, and the discipleswho were with him said, "Master, your grief is excessive!""Is it excessive?" said he. "If I am not to mourn bitterly for thisman, for whom should I mourn?"When Yen Yuan died, the disciples wished to give him a great funeral,and the Master said, "You may not do so."The disciples did bury him in great style.</p> 
<p>　　The Master said, "Hui behaved towards me as his father. I have notbeen able to treat him as my son. The fault is not mine; it belongsto you, O disciples."Chi Lu asked about serving the spirits of the dead. The Master said,"While you are not able to serve men, how can you serve their spirits?"Chi Lu added, "I venture to ask about death?" He was answered, "Whileyou do not know life, how can you know about death?"The disciple Min was standing by his side, looking bland and precise;Tsze-lu, looking bold and soldierly; Zan Yu and Tsze-kung, with afree and straightforward manner. The Master was pleased.</p> 
<p>　　He said, "Yu, there!-he will not die a natural death."Some parties in Lu were going to take down and rebuild the Long Treasury.</p> 
<p>　　Min Tsze-ch'ien said, "Suppose it were to be repaired after its oldstyle;-why must it be altered and made anew?"The Master said, "This man seldom speaks; when he does, he is sureto hit the point."The Master said, "What has the lute of Yu to do in my door?"The other disciples began not to respect Tszelu. The Master said,"Yu has ascended to the hall, though he has not yet passed into theinner apartments."Tsze-kung asked which of the two, Shih or Shang, was the superior.</p> 
<p>　　The Master said, "Shih goes beyond the due mean, and Shang does notcome up to it.""Then," said Tsze-kung, "the superiority is with Shih, I suppose."The Master said, "To go beyond is as wrong as to fall short."The head of the Chi family was richer than the duke of Chau had been,and yet Ch'iu collected his imposts for him, and increased his wealth.</p> 
<p>　　The Master said, "He is no disciple of mine. My little children, beatthe drum and assail him."Ch'ai is simple. Shan is dull. Shih is specious. Yu is coarse.</p> 
<p>　　The Master said, "There is Hui! He has nearly attained to perfectvirtue. He is often in want.</p> 
<p>　　"Ts'ze does not acquiesce in the appointments of Heaven, and his goodsare increased by him. Yet his judgments are often correct."Tsze-chang asked what were the characteristics of the good man. TheMaster said, "He does not tread in the footsteps of others, but moreover,he does not enter the chamber of the sage."The Master said, "If, because a man's discourse appears solid andsincere, we allow him to be a good man, is he really a superior man?</p> 
<p>　　or is his gravity only in appearance?"Tsze-lu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice whathe heard. The Master said, "There are your father and elder brothersto be consulted;-why should you act on that principle of immediatelycarrying into practice what you hear?" Zan Yu asked the same, whetherhe should immediately carry into practice what he heard, and the Masteranswered, "Immediately carry into practice what you hear." Kung-hsiHwa said, "Yu asked whether he should carry immediately into practicewhat he heard, and you said, 'There are your father and elder brothersto be consulted.' Ch'iu asked whether he should immediately carryinto practice what he heard, and you said, 'Carry it immediately intopractice.' I, Ch'ih, am perplexed, and venture to ask you for an explanation."The Master said, "Ch'iu is retiring and slow; therefore I urged himforward. Yu has more than his own share of energy; therefore I kepthim back."The Master was put in fear in K'wang and Yen Yuan fell behind. TheMaster, on his rejoining him, said, "I thought you had died." Huireplied, "While you were alive, how should I presume to die?"Chi Tsze-zan asked whether Chung Yu and Zan Ch'iu could be calledgreat ministers.</p> 
<p>　　The Master said, "I thought you would ask about some extraordinaryindividuals, and you only ask about Yu and Ch'iu!</p> 
<p>　　"What is called a great minister, is one who serves his prince accordingto what is right, and when he finds he cannot do so, retires.</p> 
<p>　　"Now, as to Yu and Ch'iu, they may be called ordinary ministers."Tsze-zan said, "Then they will always follow their chief;-win they?"The Master said, "In an act of parricide or regicide, they would notfollow him."Tsze-lu got Tsze-kao appointed governor of Pi.</p> 
<p>　　The Master said, "You are injuring a man's son."Tsze-lu said, "There are, there, common people and officers; thereare the altars of the spirits of the land and grain. Why must oneread books before he can be considered to have learned?"The Master said, "It is on this account that I hate your glib-tonguedpeople."Tsze-lu, Tsang Hsi, Zan Yu, and Kunghsi Hwa were sitting by the Master.</p> 
<p>　　He said to them, "Though I am a day or so older than you, do not thinkof that.</p> 
<p>　　"From day to day you are saying, 'We are not known.' If some rulerwere to know you, what would you like to do?"Tsze-lu hastily and lightly replied, "Suppose the case of a stateof ten thousand chariots; let it be straitened between other largecities; let it be suffering from invading armies; and to this letthere be added a famine in corn and in all vegetables:-if I were intrustedwith the government of it, in three years' time I could make the peopleto be bold, and to recognize the rules of righteous conduct." TheMaster smiled at him.</p> 
<p>　　Turning to Yen Yu, he said, "Ch'iu, what are your wishes?" Ch'iu replied,"Suppose a state of sixty or seventy li square, or one of fifty orsixty, and let me have the government of it;-in three years' time,I could make plenty to abound among the people. As to teaching themthe principles of propriety, and music, I must wait for the rise ofa superior man to do that.""What are your wishes, Ch'ih," said the Master next to Kung-hsi Hwa.</p> 
<p>　　Ch'ih replied, "I do not say that my ability extends to these things,but I should wish to learn them. At the services of the ancestraltemple, and at the audiences of the princes with the sovereign, Ishould like, dressed in the dark square-made robe and the black linencap, to act as a small assistant."Last of all, the Master asked Tsang Hsi, "Tien, what are your wishes?"Tien, pausing as he was playing on his lute, while it was yet twanging,laid the instrument aside, and "My wishes," he said, "are differentfrom the cherished purposes of these three gentlemen." "What harmis there in that?" said the Master; "do you also, as well as they,speak out your wishes." Tien then said, "In this, the last month ofspring, with the dress of the season all complete, along with fiveor six young men who have assumed the cap, and six or seven boys,I would wash in the I, enjoy the breeze among the rain altars, andreturn home singing." The Master heaved a sigh and said, "I give myapproval to Tien."The three others having gone out, Tsang Hsi remained behind, and said,"What do you think of the words of these three friends?" The Masterreplied, "They simply told each one his wishes."Hsi pursued, "Master, why did you smile at Yu?"He was answered, "The management of a state demands the rules of propriety.</p> 
<p>　　His words were not humble; therefore I smiled at him."Hsi again said, "But was it not a state which Ch'iu proposed for himself?"The reply was, "Yes; did you ever see a territory of sixty or seventyli or one of fifty or sixty, which was not a state?"Once more, Hsi inquired, "And was it not a state which Ch'ih proposedfor himself?" The Master again replied, "Yes; who but princes haveto do with ancestral temples, and with audiences but the sovereign?</p> 
<p>　　If Ch'ih were to be a small assistant in these services, who couldbe a great one?</p>
