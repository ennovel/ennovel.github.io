The Master said, "He maypass. He does not mind small matters."Chung-kung said, "If a man cherish in himself a reverential feelingof the necessity of attention to business, though he may be easy insmall matters in his government of the people, that may be allowed.</p> 
<p>　　But if he cherish in himself that easy feeling, and also carry itout in his practice, is not such an easymode of procedure excessive?"The Master said, "Yung's words are right."The Duke Ai asked which of the disciples loved to learn.</p> 
<p>　　Confucius replied to him, "There was Yen Hui; he loved to learn. Hedid not transfer his anger; he did not repeat a fault. Unfortunately,his appointed time was short and he died; and now there is not suchanother. I have not yet heard of any one who loves to learn as hedid."Tsze-hwa being employed on a mission to Ch'i, the disciple Zan requestedgrain for his mother. The Master said, "Give her a fu." Yen requestedmore. "Give her a yi," said the Master. Yen gave her five ping.</p> 
<p>　　The Master said, "When Ch'ih was proceeding to Ch'i, he had fat horsesto his carriage, and wore light furs. I have heard that a superiorman helps the distressed, but does not add to the wealth of the rich."Yuan Sze being made governor of his town by the Master, he gave himnine hundred measures of grain, but Sze declined them.</p> 
<p>　　The Master said, "Do not decline them. May you not give them awayin the neighborhoods, hamlets, towns, and villages?"The Master, speaking of Chung-kung, said, "If the calf of a brindledcow be red and homed, although men may not wish to use it, would thespirits of the mountains and rivers put it aside?"The Master said, "Such was Hui that for three months there would benothing in his mind contrary to perfect virtue. The others may attainto this on some days or in some months, but nothing more."Chi K'ang asked about Chung-yu, whether he was fit to be employedas an officer of government. The Master said, "Yu is a man of decision;what difficulty would he find in being an officer of government?"K'ang asked, "Is Ts'ze fit to be employed as an officer of government?"and was answered, "Ts'ze is a man of intelligence; what difficultywould he find in being an officer of government?" And to the samequestion about Ch'iu the Master gave the same reply, saying, "Ch'iuis a man of various ability."The chief of the Chi family sent to ask Min Tsze-ch'ien to be governorof Pi. Min Tszech'ien said, "Decline the offer for me politely. Ifany one come again to me with a second invitation, I shall be obligedto go and live on the banks of the Wan."Po-niu being ill, the Master went to ask for him. He took hold ofhis hand through the window, and said, "It is killing him. It is theappointment of Heaven, alas! That such a man should have such a sickness!</p> 
<p>　　That such a man should have such a sickness!"The Master said, "Admirable indeed was the virtue of Hui! With a singlebamboo dish of rice, a single gourd dish of drink, and living in hismean narrow lane, while others could not have endured the distress,he did not allow his joy to be affected by it. Admirable indeed wasthe virtue of Hui!"Yen Ch'iu said, "It is not that I do not delight in your doctrines,but my strength is insufficient." The Master said, "Those whose strengthis insufficient give over in the middle of the way but now you limityourself."The Master said to Tsze-hsia, "Do you be a scholar after the styleof the superior man, and not after that of the mean man."Tsze-yu being governor of Wu-ch'ang, the Master said to him, "Haveyou got good men there?" He answered, "There is Tan-t'ai Miehming,who never in walking takes a short cut, and never comes to my office,excepting on public business."The Master said, "Mang Chih-fan does not boast of his merit. Beingin the rear on an occasion of flight, when they were about to enterthe gate, he whipped up his horse, saying, "It is not that I dareto be last. My horse would not advance."The Master said, "Without the specious speech of the litanist T'oand the beauty of the prince Chao of Sung, it is difficult to escapein the present age."The Master said, "Who can go out but by the door? How is it that menwill not walk according to these ways?"The Master said, "Where the solid qualities are in excess of accomplishments,we have rusticity; where the accomplishments are in excess of thesolid qualities, we have the manners of a clerk. When the accomplishmentsand solid qualities are equally blended, we then have the man of virtue."The Master said, "Man is born for uprightness. If a man lose his uprightness,and yet live, his escape from death is the effect of mere good fortune."The Master said, "They who know the truth are not equal to those wholove it, and they who love it are not equal to those who delight init."The Master said, "To those whose talents are above mediocrity, thehighest subjects may be announced. To those who are below mediocrity,the highest subjects may not be announced."Fan Ch'ih asked what constituted wisdom. The Master said, "To giveone's self earnestly to the duties due to men, and, while respectingspiritual beings, to keep aloof from them, may be called wisdom."He asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, "The man of virtuemakes the difficulty to be overcome his first business, and successonly a subsequent consideration;-this may be called perfect virtue."The Master said, "The wise find pleasure in water; the virtuous findpleasure in hills. The wise are active; the virtuous are tranquil.</p> 
<p>　　The wise are joyful; the virtuous are long-lived."The Master said, "Ch'i, by one change, would come to the State ofLu. Lu, by one change, would come to a State where true principlespredominated."The Master said, "A cornered vessel without corners-a strange corneredvessel! A strange cornered vessel!"Tsai Wo asked, saying, "A benevolent man, though it be told him,-'Thereis a man in the well" will go in after him, I suppose." Confuciussaid, "Why should he do so?" A superior man may be made to go to thewell, but he cannot be made to go down into it. He may be imposedupon, but he cannot be fooled."The Master said, "The superior man, extensively studying all learning,and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules of propriety,may thus likewise not overstep what is right."The Master having visited Nan-tsze, Tsze-lu was displeased, on whichthe Master swore, saying, "Wherein I have done improperly, may Heavenreject me, may Heaven reject me!"The Master said, "Perfect is the virtue which is according to theConstant Mean! Rare for a long time has been its practice among thepeople."Tsze-kung said, "Suppose the case of a man extensively conferringbenefits on the people, and able to assist all, what would you sayof him? Might he be called perfectly virtuous?" The Master said, "Whyspeak only of virtue in connection with him? Must he not have thequalities of a sage? Even Yao and Shun were still solicitous aboutthis.</p> 
<p>　　"Now the man of perfect virtue, wishing to be established himself,seeks also to establish others; wishing to be enlarged himself, heseeks also to enlarge others.</p> 
<p>　　"To be able to judge of others by what is nigh in ourselves;-thismay be called the art of virtue."</p>
