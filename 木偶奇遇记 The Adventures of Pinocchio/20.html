<p>　　Without saying yes or no, he fled from the city and setout on the road that was to take him back to the house ofthe lovely Fairy.</p> 
<p>　　It had rained for many days, and the road was so muddythat, at times, Pinocchio sank down almost to his knees.</p> 
<p>　　But he kept on bravely.</p> 
<p>　　Tormented by the wish to see his father and his fairy sister with azure hair, he raced like a greyhound. As heran, he was splashed with mud even up to his cap.</p> 
<p>　　"How unhappy I have been," he said to himself. "Andyet I deserve everything, for I am certainly very stubbornand stupid! I will always have my own way. I won'tlisten to those who love me and who have more brainsthan I. But from now on, I'll be different and I'll try tobecome a most obedient boy. I have found out, beyondany doubt whatever, that disobedient boys are certainlyfar from happy, and that, in the long run, they alwayslose out. I wonder if Father is waiting for me. Will Ifind him at the Fairy's house? It is so long, poor man,since I have seen him, and I do so want his love and hiskisses. And will the Fairy ever forgive me for all I havedone? She who has been so good to me and to whom Iowe my life! Can there be a worse or more heartlessboy than I am anywhere?"As he spoke, he stopped suddenly, frozen with terror.</p> 
<p>　　What was the matter? An immense Serpent lay stretchedacross the road--a Serpent with a bright green skin,fiery eyes which glowed and burned, and a pointed tailthat smoked like a chimney.</p> 
<p>　　How frightened was poor Pinocchio! He ran backwildly for half a mile, and at last settled himself atop aheap of stones to wait for the Serpent to go on his wayand leave the road clear for him.</p> 
<p>　　He waited an hour; two hours; three hours; but theSerpent was always there, and even from afar one could see the flash of his red eyes and the column of smokewhich rose from his long, pointed tail.</p> 
<p>　　Pinocchio, trying to feel very brave, walked straight upto him and said in a sweet, soothing voice:</p> 
<p>　　"I beg your pardon, Mr. Serpent, would you be sokind as to step aside to let me pass?"He might as well have talked to a wall. The Serpentnever moved.</p> 
<p>　　Once more, in the same sweet voice, he spoke:</p> 
<p>　　"You must know, Mr. Serpent, that I am going homewhere my father is waiting for me. It is so long since Ihave seen him! Would you mind very much if I passed?"He waited for some sign of an answer to his questions,but the answer did not come. On the contrary, the greenSerpent, who had seemed, until then, wide awake and fullof life, became suddenly very quiet and still. His eyesclosed and his tail stopped smoking.</p> 
<p>　　"Is he dead, I wonder?" said Pinocchio, rubbing hishands together happily. Without a moment's hesitation,he started to step over him, but he had just raised one legwhen the Serpent shot up like a spring and the Marionettefell head over heels backward. He fell so awkwardlythat his head stuck in the mud, and there he stood withhis legs straight up in the air.</p> 
<p>　　At the sight of the Marionette kicking and squirminglike a young whirlwind, the Serpent laughed so heartily and so long that at last he burst an artery and died on the spot.</p> 
<p>　　Pinocchio freed himself from his awkward position andonce more began to run in order to reach the Fairy'shouse before dark. As he went, the pangs of hunger grewso strong that, unable to withstand them, he jumped intoa field to pick a few grapes that tempted him. Woe to him!</p> 
<p>　　No sooner had he reached the grapevine than--crack!</p> 
<p>　　went his legs.</p> 
<p>　　The poor Marionette was caught in a trap set there bya Farmer for some Weasels which came every night tosteal his chickens.</p>
