<p>　　"You rascal of a Marionette! How did you know it was I?"she asked, laughing.</p> 
<p>　　"My love for you told me who you were.""Do you remember? You left me when I was a little girl and now you find me a grown woman. I am so old, I couldalmost be your mother!""I am very glad of that, for then I can call you motherinstead of sister. For a long time I have wanted a mother,just like other boys. But how did you grow so quickly?""That's a secret!""Tell it to me. I also want to grow a little. Look at me!</p> 
<p>　　I have never grown higher than a penny's worth of cheese.""But you can't grow," answered the Fairy.</p> 
<p>　　"Why not?""Because Marionettes never grow. They are born Marionettes,they live Marionettes, and they die Marionettes.""Oh, I'm tired of always being a Marionette!" cried Pinocchio disgustedly.</p> 
<p>　　"It's about time for me to grow into a man as everyone else does.""And you will if you deserve it--""Really? What can I do to deserve it?""It's a very simple matter. Try to act like a well-behaved child.""Don't you think I do?""Far from it! Good boys are obedient, and you, on the contrary--""And I never obey.""Good boys love study and work, but you--""And I, on the contrary, am a lazy fellow and a tramp all year round.""Good boys always tell the truth.""And I always tell lies.""Good boys go gladly to school.""And I get sick if I go to school. From now on I'll be different.""Do you promise?""I promise. I want to become a good boy and be a comfort to my father.</p> 
<p>　　Where is my poor father now?""I do not know.""Will I ever be lucky enough to find him and embrace him once more?""I think so. Indeed, I am sure of it."At this answer, Pinocchio's happiness was very great.</p> 
<p>　　He grasped the Fairy's hands and kissed them so hard thatit looked as if he had lost his head. Then lifting his face,he looked at her lovingly and asked: "Tell me, little Mother,it isn't true that you are dead, is it?""It doesn't seem so," answered the Fairy, smiling.</p> 
<p>　　"If you only knew how I suffered and how I wept when I read `Here lies--'""I know it, and for that I have forgiven you. The depth of your sorrow made me see that you have a kind heart.</p> 
<p>　　There is always hope for boys with hearts such as yours,though they may often be very mischievous. This is thereason why I have come so far to look for you. From nowon, I'll be your own little mother.""Oh! How lovely!" cried Pinocchio, jumping with joy.</p> 
<p>　　"You will obey me always and do as I wish?""Gladly, very gladly, more than gladly!""Beginning tomorrow," said the Fairy, "you'll go to school every day."Pinocchio's face fell a little.</p> 
<p>　　"Then you will choose the trade you like best."Pinocchio became more serious.</p> 
<p>　　"What are you mumbling to yourself?" asked the Fairy.</p> 
<p>　　"I was just saying," whined the Marionette in a whisper,"that it seems too late for me to go to school now.""No, indeed. Remember it is never too late to learn.""But I don't want either trade or profession.""Why?""Because work wearies me!""My dear boy," said the Fairy, "people who speak as you do usually end their days either in a prison or in ahospital. A man, remember, whether rich or poor, shoulddo something in this world. No one can find happinesswithout work. Woe betide the lazy fellow! Laziness is aserious illness and one must cure it immediately; yes, evenfrom early childhood. If not, it will kill you in the end."These words touched Pinocchio's heart. He liftedhis eyes to his Fairy and said seriously:</p> 
<p>　　"I'll work; I'll study; I'll do all you tell me.</p> 
<p>　　After all, the life of a Marionette has grown very tiresometo me and I want to become a boy, no matter how hard it is.</p> 
<p>　　You promise that, do you not?""Yes, I promise, and now it is up to you."</p>
