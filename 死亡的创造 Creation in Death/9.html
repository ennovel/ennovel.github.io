The woman was a New Yorker, Eve mused. Which meant she’d move along at a brisk pace, and though her radar would be on, she’d be inside her own thoughts.</p> 
<p>Might be a window-shopper, Eve thought. Might stop and study a display, even go inside a shop. But…</p> 
<p>“Baxter and Trueheart checked out the stores and markets along the route,” she said to Peabody. “Nobody remembers seeing her that day. Some clerks recognized her picture. Previous visits. But not on the day she poofed.”</p> 
<p>“She didn’t make it to the station.”</p> 
<p>“No. Maybe she wasn’t going to the station.” Eve turned, sidestepping toward the buildings as New York bustled by. “Had extra dough, enough for a pair of courtsides. She takes an outside client. Maybe the client’s address is within walking distance. Or he provided cab fare or transportation.”</p> 
<p>And considering this, she factored in Baxter’s point about the potential age difference, and the fact that Gia Rossi had been a trainer, in peak physical condition.</p> 
<p>“Maybe she walked right into it. Maybe she walked right into his nest.”</p> 
<p>“He doesn’t grab her. He just opens the door.”</p> 
<p>“Slick,” Eve said softly. “Yeah, that would be slick. Contact Newkirk. I want him and the other uniforms canvassing this area. All directions, five blocks.” Eve headed toward the car. “I want her picture shown to every clerk, waitperson, sidewalk sleeper, doorman, and droid. Get McNab,” she added as she climbed behind the wheel. “I want him to send her picture to every cab company and private transpo service. Bus companies, air trams. Hit them all. Then the Transit Authority. Check the run for that night on other stations. She didn’t use her pass, but maybe she took a ride anyway.”</p> 
<p>Peabody was already relaying to Newkirk.</p> 
<p>“She went to him,” Eve said before she swung out into traffic. “That’s what I think. She went right to him.”</p> 
<p>Following the hunch, she contacted Zela at home.</p> 
<p>“Yes?” Obviously half asleep, Zela stifled a yawn. “Lieutenant? What—”</p> 
<p>“Did Sarifina ever give private lessons?”</p> 
<p>“Private lessons? I’m sorry, I’m a little foggy.”</p> 
<p>“Dance lessons. Did she ever give private dance lessons?”</p> 
<p>“Now and again, sure. People want to be able to do the moves for special occasions. Weddings, bar or bat mitzvahs, reunions. That sort of thing.”</p> 
<p>“At the club, or at the client’s home?”</p> 
<p>“Generally at the club. Mornings when we’re closed.”</p> 
<p>“Generally,” Eve pressed, “but there were exceptions.”</p> 
<p>“Give me a second.” Zela moved as she spoke, and Eve heard the beep of an AutoChef. “I worked until nearly three last night, then took a pill. I haven’t been sleeping well since…I need to clear my head.”</p> 
<p>“Zela.” Impatience ground through Eve’s voice. “I need to know if Sarifina went to clients’ homes.”</p> 
<p>“Every once in a while, particularly for the older clients. Or the kids. Sometimes parents want their kids to learn. Or an older couple wants to swing it a little—for an occasion, or a cruise. But usually, we do that sort of thing here, through the club.”</p> 
<p>“Had she taken on any personal clients in the last few weeks?”</p> 
<p>“Just let me think, okay? Let me think.” Zela gulped down what Eve assumed was coffee. “She may have. She was an easy touch, you know? Liked to do favors for people. We didn’t check that kind of thing off with each other all the time. But if it was through the club, I mean if she was going to instruct someone here, she’d have noted in down. The club gets a cut of the fee, and Sari was religious about keeping good records on that.”</p> 
<p>“No cut if she went to them?”</p> 
<p>“Well, that’s a gray area. Like I said, she liked to do favors. She might go give someone an hour or two, cutting her rate, doing it off the books. On her own time, before or after work, on her day off. What’s the harm?”</p> 
<p>What’s the harm? Eve thought as she clicked off.</p> 
<p>“We figured he grabbed them off the street. But they went to him. These two, at least, my money says they went right to him. How’d they get there?”</p> 
<p>“York’s image has been out since yesterday. Weekend, though,” Peabody added. “If she took a cab, the driver might not have paid any attention, or might not have seen the reports on her yet.”</p> 
<p>“No. No. We have to run it down, but that would be sloppy, and he isn’t sloppy. Why take a chance like that? Leave a record, a possible wit? Cab driver dumps the vic right at his door? Doesn’t play.”</p> 
<p>“Well, the same thing applies to private transpo.”</p> 
<p>“Not if he’s providing it. Personally. We check anyway, we check all the transits. All the pickups in the area the vics were last seen.”</p> 
<p>Man hours, wasted hours, Eve thought. And still it had to be done. “He’s not going to chance something like that. Lures them in, that’s what he does. Nice, harmless guy, nice older gentleman who wants to learn to tango, wants to get fit. There’s a nice, sweet fee for the personal service. Provides transportation for them.”</p> 
<p>“Nobody sees them on the street because they’re not on the street that long.” Peabody nodded as the theory solidified for her. “They come out of work, get into a waiting vehicle. Nobody’s going to notice. But…”</p> 
<p>“But?”</p> 
<p>“How can he be sure they’re not going to tell somebody? What I mean is, neither of these women seems stupid. How could he be sure they’re not going to tell a friend, a coworker, they’ve got this private gig. Here’s where I’m going to be, and with whom.”</p> 
<p>Eve pulled over in front of Gia Rossi’s apartment building, then just sat, tapping her fingers on the wheel. “Good point. We know they didn’t tell anyone, or anyone who’s passed on that information. So the why, the how can he be sure. Gotta play the percentages.” She got out, drawing her master to deal with the door. “First he’s going to give them a bogus name and address. Now, if they’re smart, or concerned in any way, they’re going to check that out, make sure it’s legit. Not hard to pull that off if you’ve got enough money and know-how. But that’s another area for EDD to look into.”</p> 
<p>They stepped inside the three-story walk-up, where Rossi’s apartment was on ground level. “Next, think of his profile. Intelligent, mature, controlled.”</p> 
<p>She used the master again to break the seal Baxter had activated, and uncode the locks. “We know he travels, so we’re looking at someone who’s likely sophisticated, and I’m just going to bet charming. He knows his victims.”</p> 
<p>When they stepped in, Eve paused to look around the cramped living area. Big wall screen, she noted, small couch, a couple of chairs, tables holding decorative bits and pieces. Tossed socks, shoes—mostly of the athletic variety. The electronics had already been taken in.</p> 
<p>“Knows what they like,” she continued, “what appeals to them. Plays that. Gets familiar with them face-to-face, dropping into their respective clubs, chatting them up. But not too much, not so anyone pays particular attention. He blends, and he blends. Mr. Smooth, Mr. Nice Guy, Mr. Harmless.”</p> 
<p>She walked over to the window, studied the street, the sidewalk, the neighboring buildings. “He gains their trust. Maybe he talks about his wife or his daughter, something that paints a picture in their heads. Normality. Takes time, sure, but he likes to take time. Then he brings up the private work—or smarter, he maneuvers them into mentioning it or suggesting it.”</p> 
<p>She turned, walked into the tiny, equally cramped bedroom. “Then he’s got them. She’s got privacy screens, but they’re old and cheap. Right equipment, you could watch her in here. You know when she gets up, how long it takes her to get ready for work, what time she leaves, her route. Bet you keep it all documented. Scientific, that’s what it is. I wonder how many he’s picked, watched, documented, and rejected. How many women are alive because they didn’t quite fit his precise requirements.”</p> 
<p>“Creepy.”</p> 
<p>“Yeah.” Dipping her hands into her pockets, Eve rocked back on her heels. “Maybe he’s always worked this way, or worked this way before. The prior personal contact, the maneuvering the target to go to him. We’ll go back over the old cases with that angle. And we’ll look at the projected targets in this one with that in mind.”</p> 
<p>“Dallas? What are we looking for here? I mean, here in her place.”</p> 
<p>“Her. Gia Rossi. He knows the pieces of her, or thinks he does. Let’s see what we find.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I t was what they didn’t find that added weight to Eve’s theory. However cramped and messy the living space, Gia Rossi kept her exercise and music discs meticulously organized.</p> 
<p>“Two slots empty in her workout disc tree, three empty in her music disc tree. The way she’s got them alphabetized, I’m guessing cardio and yoga on the fitness end. We’ll check the personal effects Baxter took from her gym locker.”</p> 
<p>“She’s got a lot of personal equipment. Hand weights, ankle and wrist weights, mats, medicine balls, running track.” Peabody gestured inside the closet that Rossi had outfitted for equipment storage. “I’m guessing some’s missing. Lightest and heaviest ankle weights, light and heavy resistance ropes.”</p> 
<p>“Light for him, heavy for her. Takes some basic equipment, some music, the demo vids. You ever work with a PT?”</p> 
<p>“No.” Peabody flexed her butt muscles, wondering if that was the way to reduce the square footage of her ass. “You?”</p> 
<p>“No, but I’m betting a good one would outline a program for a client—something specifically created for his body type, age, weight, goals, and so on. If she did it here, EDD can find it. Let’s go.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>R oarke walked into a war room full of chatter of both the human and electronic varieties. Cops on ’links, on headsets, on comps. Cops sitting, pacing, dancing.</p> 
<p>But his cop was nowhere to be seen.</p> 
<p>He crossed paths with McNab, who was outfitted in silver jeans and a casual Sunday sweatshirt of searing orange. “Is the lieutenant in the house?”</p> 
<p>“In the field. Heading in, though. Working some fresh angles. You want?”</p> 
<p>“I want.”</p> 
<p>Tapping the toes of his silver airboots, McNab swiveled in his chair. “Just covered all public and private transpo with pictures of York and Rossi. Dallas is working the idea that our guy provided transpo.”</p> 
<p>“And they just hopped in?”</p> 
<p>“Yeah. Need liquid. Walk and talk.”</p> 
<p>McNab filled Roarke in as he headed out to Vending, debated his choices, and opted for an orange fizzy—perhaps to match his shirt.</p> 
<p>“A home lesson or consultation,” Roarke mused. “Interesting, and it would eliminate the risk of any sort of public abduction. Still, the method has its own risks and problems.”</p> 
<p>“Yeah, what if they change their minds, don’t show, decide to bring a pal along. Lots of possibles.” He sucked in fizzy. “But she wants it worked, so we work it. She said if you popped in, you should take a look at your employee list with this angle in mind. Women who fit the parameters who might do a house call on the side.”</p> 
<p>“Yes, I can do that.”</p> 
<p>“Lots of possibles,” McNab repeated, “considering all the pies you’ve got fingers in. Anything moving on the real estate angle?”</p> 
<p>“Nothing that stands out from the crowd, no.”</p> 
<p>“Sometimes you’ve got to toss it up, you know. Let it fall in a different pattern. You keep working it, it gets so it’s just data. Maybe I could take that for a while while you work the new business.”</p> 
<p>“Fresh eyes. Yes, that’s a good idea.”</p> 
<p>“Icy, then…Hey, here come our ladies. Just looking at them gives you the uh, doesn’t it?” McNab gave the sound a push that was unmistakably sexual as he grinned down the long corridor where Peabody got off the glide with Eve.</p> 
<p>Then he shot Roarke a quick look. “I mean the uh me for mine, you for yours. It’s not like I get the uh for the lieutenant, for which she would kick my ass, then leave you to turn what was left of it into bloody dust. Which She-Body would then grind into the earth before she set it on fire. I was just saying.”</p> 
<p>“I know what you were saying.” McNab could, invariably, entertain him. “And I couldn’t agree more, with everything including the bloody dust. They are compelling women. Lieutenant,” Roarke said as her long stride brought her to him.</p> 
<p>“So glad you two have time for fizzy breaks.”</p> 
<p>“Sir. I’ve been bringing Roarke up to date, and relaying your orders.”</p> 
<p>“Looked like slurping and ogling to me.”</p> 
<p>“Ah…those may have been minor factors, but neither overshadowed the update or relay. Vic’s images are broadcasted, Lieutenant. I set up another line for responses from those sources. We’ve been fielding tips and inquiries on the investigations, and I figured if we got something out of this, we didn’t want it to get bogged down in the general dump.”</p> 
<p>“Good. That’s good thinking. I want you to pass off whatever you’re doing and take Rossi’s equipment. Her comp. I’m looking for personalized fitness programs. Find me one that matches our unsub.”</p> 
<p>“On that.”</p> 
<p>“Feeney?”</p> 
<p>“Roving mode,” McNab told her. “Gives a look and a buzz to whatever everyone’s working. Tightens it up or opens it out. He was playing the medical equipment angle when I came out to get—when I stepped out to update Roarke.”</p> 
<p>“Tell him I need somebody to go down to BodyWorks. Rossi used a couple of comps there routinely. The manager’s been contacted and is cooperating. Get them brought in and gone through. Same search.”</p> 
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p> 
<p>“Roarke, with me.”</p> 
<p>Roarke fell into step beside her. “Formidable.”</p> 
<p>“What?”</p> 
<p>“You. I’d used compelling, but formidable suits as well. Very sexy.”</p> 
<p>“Don’t say ‘sexy’ on the job.”</p> 
<p>“You just did.”</p> 
<p>Okay, she admitted, he made her laugh. Which was obviously the point and intent. And it did relieve some of the tension at the base of her skull. “Got your smarty pants on, I see.”</p> 
<p>She moved into the bullpen, stopped her forward motion when one of the men called her name. “Got a DB in a flop off Avenue D,” he began. “Licensed companion over there…”</p> 
<p>He jerked his head toward the skinny woman in a bloody shirt seated at his desk. “She says the guy wanted to party, the party was had. He refused to pay the bill and popped her two good ones when she objected to getting stiffed. Pulled out her sticker, which she claims he ran into. Six times.”</p> 
<p>“Clumsy of him.”</p> 
<p>“Yeah. Thing is, Lieutenant, she called it in. Didn’t try to rabbit, and she’s sticking to the story. Claims he laughed like a looney bird every time the knife went in. Got a couple of wits saw them make the deal, another who heard them yelling in the flop. You can see she’s got herself a pretty good shiner working there.”</p> 
<p>“Yeah. Got priors?”</p> 
<p>“Couple little bumps, nothing violent. Had her LC ticket for three years.”</p> 
<p>“And the DB?”</p> 
<p>“Oh, he had a nice long sheet. Assaults, assaults with deadlies, illegals—possession and intent. Just got out of the cage for an attempted robbery—beat hell out of a clerk at a twenty-four/seven. On the Zeus.”</p> 
<p>Eve studied the LC. The woman looked more annoyed than worried. And her face was sporting a sick rainbow of bruises. “Guy on Zeus could run into a knife multiple times. Wait for the tox screen on the DB, run her through again, see if she stands on the story, then put her in holding.”</p> 
<p>“Guy was juiced up, a lime green PD’s going to get a self-defense. Could slap her for the sticker, as it was over legal limit.”</p> 
<p>“What’s the point?”</p> 
<p>“Yeah, that’s what I was thinking. Wanted to run it by you first.”</p> 
<p>“She ask for a PD or a rep?”</p> 
<p>“Not yet. Pissed is what she is.” He nodded over to her desk. “Knows the incident means an automatic thirty-day suspension of her license. So she’s out the fee and a month’s work, got a fist in the face, and ruined what she says is a new shirt.”</p> 
<p>“That’s the life. Get the tox, wrap it up. Reach out to Illegals on the DB if anything looks shaky,” Eve added. “Somebody over there probably has a take on him.”</p> 
<p>She walked into her office, shut the door.</p> 
<p>“She’ll walk,” Roarke commented.</p> 
<p>“Likely. Smart not to run, to come in voluntarily. Less smart to party with a guy on Zeus, if that was the case. And if she’s worked that sector for a couple, three years, she’d know if he was pumped.”</p> 
<p>“A girl’s got to make a living.”</p> 
<p>“That’s what they tell me. So, anything from the unregistered?”</p> 
<p>“Nothing that gels, not at this point. I have Summerset running more searches and crosses. He knows what to look for, and how to find it.”</p> 
<p>Her brows drew together. “Am I going to have to be grateful to him?”</p> 
<p>“I’ll take care of that.”</p> 
<p>“Good.” She pulled off her coat, went for coffee. “Did McNab actually give you an update?”</p> 
<p>“He did, yes. I’ll go through the employee list, cull out any who might take a home appointment or consultation. Do you think now this has been his pattern all along?”</p> 
<p>“I don’t know, can’t say.” Eve rubbed at her eyes, then scratched her head furiously as if to wake up the brain under her scalp. “But we’re talking more than twenty women. How likely is it that not one of them ever told anyone where they were going? Bogus name, sure, but if they had the location in advance, made this appointment, how likely is it none of them told anyone, or left any sort of record of the appointment?”</p> 
<p>“Low. Yes, I see. But…There may have been more than the twenty. And I see you’ve considered that as well,” he added when he studied her face. “He picked them, made the arrangements, and if he sensed or learned they’d mentioned it, he’d simply follow through with the cover. Take his fucking dance lesson.”</p> 
<p>“Yeah, I think he could pull that off. And I think he could grab or lure them later in his schedule. So we go back over the prior cases, find out if any of the vics took a house call in the week or two before they were killed. He’s focused,” Eve continued, “careful enough to make sure he’s clear, but focused. I can see him postponing the grab, or switching vics. If so, it’s something we didn’t have before. A mistake we missed.”</p> 
<p>Roarke drank his coffee. The office seemed ridiculously confining to him all at once. The piss-poor light barely seeping through her excuse for a window, the tight box formed by the walls.</p> 
<p>“Haven’t you ever considered asking for a bigger office?”</p> 
<p>“What for?”</p> 
<p>“A little breathing room might be a plus.”</p> 
<p>“I can breathe fine. You can’t take this in, Roarke.”</p> 
<p>“And how would you suggest I avoid that?” he demanded. “I’m his springboard, aren’t I? There’s a woman dead because she worked for me. Another who, even now, is being tortured. It’s too late for Gia Rossi.”</p> 
<p>“It’s not too late until it’s too late.” Still, she knew she owed him the straight line, and that he had to be able to deal with it. “The probability is low that we’ll find her in time. It’s not impossible, but at this point, it’s not likely.”</p> 
<p>“And the next, she’d already be in his sights.”</p> 
<p>“He’d have stalked her, selected her, worked her by now. But we’ve got more time there. He’s not infallible, and there’s only one of him. I’ve put the best I’ve got on this. It ends here.”</p> 
<p>Her eyes went flat, cop flat. “It’s going to end here. But you’re no good to me if you can’t set the emotional connection aside.”</p> 
<p>“Well, I can’t. But I can use it. I can do what I need to do.”</p> 
<p>“Okay.”</p> 
<p>“Which includes getting right pissed from time to time.”</p> 
<p>“Fine. But get this in your head. The responsibility for this is his. Totally, completely, absolutely. No portion of it’s yours. He owns it. If his mother used him as her butt monkey when he was a kid, he still owns it. He made the choice. If his father, uncle, aunt, cousin from Toledo kicked his ass every Tuesday, it’s still his. You and I know that. We know about the choice. We know, whenever we take a life, whatever the circumstances, whatever the reasons, it’s still our choice. Right or wrong, we own it.”</p> 
<p>Roarke considered his coffee, set it aside. And his eyes met hers. “I love you, for so many reasons.”</p> 
<p>“Maybe you can give me a few of them later.”</p> 
<p>“I’ll give you one now. That unfailing moral center of yours. So very solid and true.” He laid his hands on her shoulders, drew her in. Kissed her softly. “And then there’s the sex.”</p> 
<p>“Figured you’d work that in.”</p> 
<p>“As often as humanly possible. Well then.” He gave her shoulders a rub, stepped back. “There’s one thing I can do now, and that’s order in lunch for the team. Don’t,” he continued, lifting a warning finger, “give me any lip.”</p> 
<p>“I thought you like my lip—the set of them. Look, I don’t want you to—”</p> 
<p>“I was thinking pizza.”</p> 
<p>Her eyes slitted; she huffed out a breath. “That’s hitting below the belt, pal.”</p> 
<p>“I know your every weakness, Lieutenant. And this one’s topped with pepperoni.”</p> 
<p>“Just don’t make a habit of it. The food. They’ll get greedy.”</p> 
<p>“I think your team’s steady enough to handle a few slices. I’ll take care of it, and start on the employee list.”</p> 
<p>When he left, she closed the door behind him. She wanted to work in the quiet for a while, with minimal interruption. To think and theorize before she went back to the noise and pressures of the war room.</p> 
<p>She brought up the files on the first investigation.</p> 
<p>She knew these women. Their names, their faces, where they’d come from, where they’d lived, where they’d worked or studied.</p> 
<p>A diverse group, in all but general appearance. And now she would look for one more point of origin.</p> 
<p>Corrine, would-be actress working as a waitress, who’d squeezed in acting, dance, and vocal lessons when she could afford them. He could have played her, yes, he could have in several ways. Come to this location to audition for a part—what hungry young actress wouldn’t bite? Or come to this address on this date and time to help serve at a party. Pick up some extra cash. Possibilities.</p> 
<p>She went down the list of names. A secretary, a grad student working on her master’s in foreign studies, a clerk in a gift shop who dabbled in pottery.</p> 
<p>Following the string, she began to make calls, questioning people she’d interviewed nine years before.</p> 
<p>There was a quick knock, then Peabody stuck her head in. She had a slice of pizza, half eaten, in her hand. “Pizza’s here. They’re pouncing on it like wolves. You’d better get out there if you want any.”</p> 
<p>“Minute.”</p> 
<p>Peabody took another bite. “You got something?”</p> 
<p>“Maybe. Maybe.” Eve wished the scent of pizza wasn’t so damn distracting. “I’ll bring it in. Get whoever’s in the field on a headset. I want to brief everyone at once.”</p> 
<p>“You got it.”</p> 
<p>“Get the vics from the first investigation up on screen, with data.”</p> 
<p>Eve gathered her notes, her discs, then tagged Mira. “I need you in the war room.”</p> 
<p>“Ten minutes.”</p> 
<p>“Sooner,” Eve said and clicked off.</p> 
<p>When Eve strode into the war room, she noted that two pizzas had been demolished along with most of a third. After setting down her notes, she marched over, grabbed a slice.</p> 
<p>“Got Jenkinson, Powell, Newkirk, and Harris on the line,” Peabody told her. “Everyone else is here.”</p> 
<p>“Mira’s on her way. I want her take on this.” Even as Eve bit in, Feeney was coming toward her.</p> 
<p>“You’ve got something. I can see it.”</p> 
<p>“Might. A possible link, possible method. I’m going to lay it out as soon as Mira’s in the room.” She glanced over, then handily caught the tube of Pepsi that Roarke tossed her. “Progress?” she asked him.</p> 
<p>“I have fifty-six most possible, given their vocations or avocations. Still coming.”</p> 
<p>“Okay. Peabody, get the screen up, backed with the disc I brought in.” She nodded when Mira came in. After taking a long sip, Eve put on the headset.</p> 
<p>“Listen up, people. I need your full attention. If you can’t eat pizza and think—”</p> 
<p>“You got pizza?” was Jenkinson’s complaint in her ear.</p>
