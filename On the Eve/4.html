There was a breath of freshness from the water, and the soft plash of tiny waves caressed the ear.
<br> 
<br> ‘I would have another bathe,’ said Shubin, ‘only I’m afraid of being late. Look at the river; it seems to beckon us. The ancient Greeks would have beheld a nymph in it. But we are not Greeks, O nymph! we are thick-skinned Scythians.’
<br> 
<br> ‘We have roussalkas,’ observed Bersenyev.
<br> 
<br> ‘Get along with your roussalkas! What’s the use to me — a sculptor — of those children of a cold, terror-stricken fancy, those shapes begotten in the stifling hut, in the dark of winter nights? I want light, space. . . . Good God, when shall I go to Italy? When ——’
<br> 
<br> ‘To Little Russia, I suppose you mean?’
<br> 
<br> ‘For shame, Andrei Petrovitch, to reproach me for an act of unpremeditated folly, which I have repented bitterly enough without that. Oh, of course, I behaved like a fool; Anna Vassilyevna most kindly gave me the money for an expedition to Italy, and I went off to the Little Russians to eat dumplings and ——’
<br> 
<br> ‘Don’t let me have the rest, please,’ interposed Bersenyev.
<br> 
<br> ‘Yet still, I will say, the money was not spent in vain. I saw there such types, especially of women. . . . Of course, I know; there is no salvation to be found outside of Italy!’
<br> 
<br> ‘You will go to Italy,’ said Bersenyev, without turning towards him, ‘and will do nothing. You will always be pluming your wings and never take flight. We know you!’
<br> 
<br> ‘Stavasser has taken flight. . . . And he’s not the only one. If I don’t fly, it will prove that I’m a sea penguin, and have no wings. I am stifled here, I want to be in Italy,’ pursued Shubin, ‘there is sunshine, there is beauty.’
<br> 
<br> A young girl in a large straw hat, with a pink parasol on her shoulder, came into sight at that instant, in the little path along which the friends were walking.
<br> 
<br> ‘But what do I see? Even here, there is beauty — coming to meet us! A humble artist’s compliments to the enchanting Zoya!’ Shubin cried at once, with a theatrical flourish of his hat.
<br> 
<br> The young girl to whom this exclamation referred, stopped, threatening him with her finger, and, waiting for the two friends to come up to her, she said in a ringing voice:
<br> 
<br> ‘Why is it, gentlemen, you don’t come in to dinner? It is on the table.’
<br> 
<br> ‘What do I hear?’ said Shubin, throwing his arms up. ‘Can it be that you, bewitching Zoya, faced such heat to come and look for us? Dare I think that is the meaning of your words? Tell me, can it be so? Or no, do not utter that word; I shall die of regret on the spot’
<br> 
<br> ‘Oh, do leave off, Pavel Yakovlitch,’ replied the young girl with some annoyance. ‘Why will you never talk to me seriously? I shall be angry,’ she added with a little coquettish grimace, and she pouted.
<br> 
<br> ‘You will not be angry with me, ideal Zoya Nikitishna; you would not drive me to the dark depths of hopeless despair. And I can’t talk to you seriously, because I’m not a serious person.’
<br> 
<br> The young girl shrugged her shoulders, and turned to Bersenyev.
<br> 
<br> ‘There, he’s always like that; he treats me like a child; and I am eighteen. I am grown-up now.’
<br> 
<br> ‘O Lord!’ groaned Shubin, rolling his eyes upwards; and Bersenyev smiled quietly.
<br> 
<br> The girl stamped with her little foot.
<br> 
<br> ‘Pavel Yakovlitch, I shall be angry! Helene was coming with me,’ she went on, ‘but she stopped in the garden. The heat frightened her, but I am not afraid of the heat. Come along.’
<br> 
<br> She moved forward along the path, slightly swaying her slender figure at each step, and with a pretty black-mittened little hand pushing her long soft curls back from her face.
<br> 
<br> The friends walked after her (Shubin first pressed his hands, without speaking, to his heart, and then flung them higher than his head), and in a few instants they came out in front of one of the numerous country villas with which Kuntsovo is surrounded. A small wooden house with a gable, painted a pink colour, stood in the middle of the garden, and seemed to be peeping out innocently from behind the green trees. Zoya was the first to open the gate; she ran into the garden, crying: ‘I have brought the wanderers!’ A young girl, with a pale and expressive face, rose from a garden bench near the little path, and in the doorway of the house appeared a lady in a lilac silk dress, holding an embroidered cambric handkerchief over her head to screen it from the sun, and smiling with a weary and listless air.
