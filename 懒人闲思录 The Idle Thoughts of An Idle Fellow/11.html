I was one myself once, thoughnot long--not so long as my clothes. They were very long, Irecollect, and always in my way when I wanted to kick. Why do babieshave such yards of unnecessary clothing? It is not a riddle. Ireally want to know. I never could understand it. Is it that theparents are ashamed of the size of the child and wish to make believethat it is longer than it actually is? I asked a nurse once why itwas. She said:
<br> 
<br> "Lor', sir, they always have long clothes, bless their little hearts."And when I explained that her answer, although doing credit to herfeelings, hardly disposed of my difficulty, she replied:
<br> 
<br> "Lor', sir, you wouldn't have 'em in short clothes, poor littledears?" And she said it in a tone that seemed to imply I hadsuggested some unmanly outrage.
<br> 
<br> Since than I have felt shy at making inquiries on the subject, and thereason--if reason there be--is still a mystery to me. But indeed,putting them in any clothes at all seems absurd to my mind. Goodnessknows there is enough of dressing and undressing to be gone through inlife without beginning it before we need; and one would think thatpeople who live in bed might at all events be spared the torture. Whywake the poor little wretches up in the morning to take one lot ofclothes off, fix another lot on, and put them to bed again, and thenat night haul them out once more, merely to change everything back?
<br> 
<br> And when all is done, what difference is there, I should like to know,between a baby's night-shirt and the thing it wears in the day-time?
<br> 
<br> Very likely, however, I am only making myself ridiculous--I often do,so I am informed--and I will therefore say no more upon this matter ofclothes, except only that it would be of great convenience if somefashion were adopted enabling you to tell a boy from a girl.
<br> 
<br> At present it is most awkward. Neither hair, dress, nor conversationaffords the slightest clew, and you are left to guess. By somemysterious law of nature you invariably guess wrong, and are thereuponregarded by all the relatives and friends as a mixture of fool andknave, the enormity of alluding to a male babe as "she" being onlyequaled by the atrocity of referring to a female infant as "he".
<br> 
<br> Whichever sex the particular child in question happens not to belongto is considered as beneath contempt, and any mention of it is takenas a personal insult to the family.
<br> 
<br> And as you value your fair name do not attempt to get out of thedifficulty by talking of "it."There are various methods by which you may achieve ignominy and shame.
<br> 
<br> By murdering a large and respected family in cold blood and afterwarddepositing their bodies in the water companies' reservoir, you willgain much unpopularity in the neighborhood of your crime, and evenrobbing a church will get you cordially disliked, especially by thevicar. But if you desire to drain to the dregs the fullest cup ofscorn and hatred that a fellow human creature can pour out for you,let a young mother hear you call dear baby "it."Your best plan is to address the article as "little angel." The noun"angel" being of common gender suits the case admirably, and theepithet is sure of being favorably received. "Pet" or "beauty" areuseful for variety's sake, but "angel" is the term that brings you thegreatest credit for sense and good-feeling. The word should bepreceded by a short giggle and accompanied by as much smile aspossible. And whatever you do, don't forget to say that the child hasgot its father's nose. This "fetches" the parents (if I may beallowed a vulgarism) more than anything. They will pretend to laughat the idea at first and will say, "Oh, nonsense!" You must then getexcited and insist that it is a fact. You need have no conscientiousscruples on the subject, because the thing's nose really does resembleits father's--at all events quite as much as it does anything else innature--being, as it is, a mere smudge.
<br> 
<br> Do not despise these hints, my friends. There may come a time when,with mamma on one side and grand mamma on the other, a group ofadmiring young ladies (not admiring you, though) behind, and abald-headed dab of humanity in front, you will be extremely thankfulfor some idea of what to say. A man--an unmarried man, that is--isnever seen to such disadvantage as when undergoing the ordeal of"seeing baby." A cold shudder runs down his back at the bareproposal, and the sickly smile with which he says how delighted heshall be ought surely to move even a mother's heart, unless, as I aminclined to believe, the whole proceeding is a mere device adopted bywives to discourage the visits of bachelor friends.
<br> 
<br> It is a cruel trick, though, whatever its excuse may be. The bell isrung and somebody sent to tell nurse to bring baby down. This is thesignal for all the females present to commence talking "baby," duringwhich time you are left to your own sad thoughts and the speculationsupon the practicability of suddenly recollecting an importantengagement, and the likelihood of your being believed if you do. Justwhen you have concocted an absurdly implausible tale about a manoutside, the door opens, and a tall, severe-looking woman enters,carrying what at first sight appears to be a particularly skinnybolster, with the feathers all at one end. Instinct, however, tellsyou that this is the baby, and you rise with a miserable attempt atappearing eager. When the first gush of feminine enthusiasm withwhich the object in question is received has died out, and the numberof ladies talking at once has been reduced to the ordinary four orfive, the circle of fluttering petticoats divides, and room is madefor you to step forward. This you do with much the same air that youwould walk into the dock at Bow Street, and then, feeling unutterablymiserable, you stand solemnly staring at the child. There is deadsilence, and you know that every one is waiting for you to speak. Youtry to think of something to say, but find, to your horror, that yourreasoning faculties have left you. It is a moment of despair, andyour evil genius, seizing the opportunity, suggests to you some of themost idiotic remarks that it is possible for a human being toperpetrate. Glancing round with an imbecile smile, you sniggeringlyobserve that "it hasn't got much hair has it?" Nobody answers you fora minute, but at last the stately nurse says with much gravity:
<br> 
<br> "It is not customary for children five weeks old to have long hair."Another silence follows this, and you feel you are being given asecond chance, which you avail yourself of by inquiring if it can walkyet, or what they feed it on.
<br> 
<br> By this time you have got to be regarded as not quite right in yourhead, and pity is the only thing felt for you. The nurse, however, isdetermined that, insane or not, there shall be no shirking and thatyou shall go through your task to the end. In the tones of a highpriestess directing some religious mystery she says, holding thebundle toward you:
<br> 
<br> "Take her in your arms, sir." You are too crushed to offer anyresistance and so meekly accept the burden. "Put your arm more downher middle, sir," says the high-priestess, and then all step back andwatch you intently as though you were going to do a trick with it.
<br> 
<br> What to do you know no more than you did what to say. It is certainsomething must be done, and the only thing that occurs to you is toheave the unhappy infant up and down to the accompaniment of"oopsee-daisy," or some remark of equal intelligence. "I wouldn't jigher, sir, if I were you," says the nurse; "a very little upsets her."You promptly decide not to jig her and sincerely hope that you havenot gone too far already.
<br> 
<br> At this point the child itself, who has hitherto been regarding youwith an expression of mingled horror and disgust, puts an end to thenonsense by beginning to yell at the top of its voice, at which thepriestess rushes forward and snatches it from you with "There! there!
<br> 
<br> there! What did ums do to ums?" "How very extraordinary!" you saypleasantly. "Whatever made it go off like that?" "Oh, why, you musthave done something to her!" says the mother indignantly; "the childwouldn't scream like that for nothing." It is evident they think youhave been running pins into it.
<br> 
<br> The brat is calmed at last, and would no doubt remain quiet enough,only some mischievous busybody points you out again with "Who's this,baby?" and the intelligent child, recognizing you, howls louder thanever.
<br> 
<br> Whereupon some fat old lady remarks that "it's strange how childrentake a dislike to any one." "Oh, they know," replies anothermysteriously. "It's a wonderful thing," adds a third; and theneverybody looks sideways at you, convinced you are a scoundrel of theblackest dye; and they glory in the beautiful idea that your truecharacter, unguessed by your fellow-men, has been discovered by theuntaught instinct of a little child.
<br> 
<br> Babies, though, with all their crimes and errors, are not withouttheir use--not without use, surely, when they fill an empty heart; notwithout use when, at their call, sunbeams of love break throughcare-clouded faces; not without use when their little fingers presswrinkles into smiles.
<br> 
<br> Odd little people! They are the unconscious comedians of the world'sgreat stage. They supply the humor in life's all-too-heavy drama.
<br> 
<br> Each one, a small but determined opposition to the order of things ingeneral, is forever doing the wrong thing at the wrong time, in thewrong place and in the wrong way. The nurse-girl who sent Jenny tosee what Tommy and Totty were doing and "tell 'em they mustn't" knewinfantile nature. Give an average baby a fair chance, and if itdoesn't do something it oughtn't to a doctor should be called in atonce.
<br> 
<br> They have a genius for doing the most ridiculous things, and they dothem in a grave, stoical manner that is irresistible. Thebusiness-like air with which two of them will join hands and proceeddue east at a break-neck toddle, while an excitable big sister isroaring for them to follow her in a westerly direction, is mostamusing--except, perhaps, for the big sister. They walk round asoldier, staring at his legs with the greatest curiosity, and poke himto see if he is real. They stoutly maintain, against all argument andmuch to the discomfort of the victim, that the bashful young man atthe end of the 'bus is "dadda." A crowded street-corner suggestsitself to their minds as a favorable spot for the discussion of familyaffairs at a shrill treble. When in the middle of crossing the roadthey are seized with a sudden impulse to dance, and the doorstep of abusy shop is the place they always select for sitting down and takingoff their shoes.
<br> 
<br> When at home they find the biggest walking-stick in the house or anumbrella--open preferred-of much assistance in getting upstairs. Theydiscover that they love Mary Ann at the precise moment when thatfaithful domestic is blackleading the stove, and nothing will relievetheir feelings but to embrace her then and there. With regard tofood, their favorite dishes are coke and cat's meat. They nurse pussyupside down, and they show their affection for the dog by pulling histail.
<br> 
<br> They are a deal of trouble, and they make a place untidy and they costa lot of money to keep; but still you would not have the house withoutthem. It would not be home without their noisy tongues and theirmischief-making hands. Would not the rooms seem silent without theirpattering feet, and might not you stray apart if no prattling voicescalled you together?
<br> 
<br> It should be so, and yet I have sometimes thought the tiny hand seemedas a wedge, dividing. It is a bearish task to quarrel with thatpurest of all human affections--that perfecting touch to a woman'slife--a mother's love. It is a holy love, that we coarser-fibered mencan hardly understand, and I would not be deemed to lack reverence forit when I say that surely it need not swallow up all other affection.
<br> 
<br> The baby need not take your whole heart, like the rich man who walledup the desert well. Is there not another thirsty traveler standingby?
<br> 
<br> In your desire to be a good mother, do not forget to be a good wife.
<br> 
<br> No need for all the thought and care to be only for one. Do not,whenever poor Edwin wants you to come out, answer indignantly, "What,and leave baby!" Do not spend all your evenings upstairs, and do notconfine your conversation exclusively to whooping-cough and measles.
<br> 
<br> My dear little woman, the child is not going to die every time itsneezes, the house is not bound to get burned down and the nurse runaway with a soldier every time you go outside the front door; nor thecat sure to come and sit on the precious child's chest the moment youleave the bedside. You worry yourself a good deal too much about thatsolitary chick, and you worry everybody else too. Try and think ofyour other duties, and your pretty face will not be always puckeredinto wrinkles, and there will be cheerfulness in the parlor as well asin the nursery. Think of your big baby a little. Dance him about abit; call him pretty names; laugh at him now and then. It is only thefirst baby that takes up the whole of a woman's time. Five or six donot require nearly so much attention as one. But before then themischief has been done. A house where there seems no room for him anda wife too busy to think of him have lost their hold on that sounreasonable husband of yours, and he has learned to look elsewherefor comfort and companionship.
<br> 
<br> But there, there, there! I shall get myself the character of ababy-hater if I talk any more in this strain. And Heaven knows I amnot one. Who could be, to look into the little innocent facesclustered in timid helplessness round those great gates that open downinto the world?
<br> 
<br> The world--the small round world! what a vast mysterious place it mustseem to baby eyes! What a trackless continent the back gardenappears! What marvelous explorations they make in the cellar underthe stairs! With what awe they gaze down the long street, wondering,like us bigger babies when we gaze up at the stars, where it all ends!
<br> 
<br> And down that longest street of all--that long, dim street of lifethat stretches out before them--what grave, old-fashioned looks theyseem to cast! What pitiful, frightened looks sometimes! I saw alittle mite sitting on a doorstep in a Soho slum one night, and Ishall never forget the look that the gas-lamp showed me on its wizenface--a look of dull despair, as if from the squalid court the vistaof its own squalid life had risen, ghostlike, and struck its heartdead with horror.
<br> 
<br> Poor little feet, just commencing the stony journey! We oldtravelers, far down the road, can only pause to wave a hand to you.
<br> 
<br> You come out of the dark mist, and we, looking back, see you, so tinyin the distance, standing on the brow of the hill, your arms stretchedout toward us. God speed you! We would stay and take your littlehands in ours, but the murmur of the great sea is in our ears and wemay not linger. We must hasten down, for the shadowy ships arewaiting to spread their sable sails.
