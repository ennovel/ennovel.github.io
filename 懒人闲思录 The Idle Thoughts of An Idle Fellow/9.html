Itbegan with Gustavus Adolphus. Gustavus Adolphus (they call him"Gusty" down-stairs for short) is a very good sort of dog when he isin the middle of a large field or on a fairly extensive common, but Iwon't have him indoors. He means well, but this house is not hissize. He stretches himself, and over go two chairs and a what-not.
<br> 
<br> He wags his tail, and the room looks as if a devastating army hadmarched through it. He breathes, and it puts the fire out.
<br> 
<br> At dinner-time he creeps in under the table, lies there for awhile,and then gets up suddenly; the first intimation we have of hismovements being given by the table, which appears animated by a desireto turn somersaults. We all clutch at it frantically and endeavor tomaintain it in a horizontal position; whereupon his struggles, hebeing under the impression that some wicked conspiracy is beinghatched against him, become fearful, and the final picture presentedis generally that of an overturned table and a smashed-up dinnersandwiched between two sprawling layers of infuriated men and women.
<br> 
<br> He came in this morning in his usual style, which he appears to havefounded on that of an American cyclone, and the first thing he did wasto sweep my coffee-cup off the table with his tail, sending thecontents full into the middle of my waistcoat.
<br> 
<br> I rose from my chair hurriedly and remarking "----," approached him ata rapid rate. He preceded me in the direction of the door. At thedoor he met Eliza coming in with eggs. Eliza observed "Ugh!" and satdown on the floor, the eggs took up different positions about thecarpet, where they spread themselves out, and Gustavus Adolphus leftthe room. I called after him, strongly advising him to go straightdownstairs and not let me see him again for the next hour or so; andhe seeming to agree with me, dodged the coal-scoop and went, while Ireturned, dried myself and finished breakfast. I made sure that hehad gone in to the yard, but when I looked into the passage tenminutes later he was sitting at the top of the stairs. I ordered himdown at once, but he only barked and jumped about, so I went to seewhat was the matter.
<br> 
<br> It was Tittums. She was sitting on the top stair but one and wouldn'tlet him pass.
<br> 
<br> Tittums is our kitten. She is about the size of a penny roll. Herback was up and she was swearing like a medical student.
<br> 
<br> She does swear fearfully. I do a little that way myself sometimes,but I am a mere amateur compared with her. To tell you thetruth--mind, this is strictly between ourselves, please; I shouldn'tlike your wife to know I said it--the women folk don't understandthese things; but between you and me, you know, I think it does at mangood to swear. Swearing is the safety-valve through which the badtemper that might otherwise do serious internal injury to his mentalmechanism escapes in harmless vaporing. When a man has said: "Blessyou, my dear, sweet sir. What the sun, moon, and stars made you socareless (if I may be permitted the expression) as to allow your lightand delicate foot to descend upon my corn with so much force? Is itthat you are physically incapable of comprehending the direction inwhich you are proceeding? you nice, clever young man--you!" or wordsto that effect, he feels better. Swearing has the same soothingeffect upon our angry passions that smashing the furniture or slammingthe doors is so well known to exercise; added to which it is muchcheaper. Swearing clears a man out like a pen'orth of gunpowder doesthe wash-house chimney. An occasional explosion is good for both. Irather distrust a man who never swears, or savagely kicks thefoot-stool, or pokes the fire with unnecessary violence. Without someoutlet, the anger caused by the ever-occurring troubles of life is aptto rankle and fester within. The petty annoyance, instead of beingthrown from us, sits down beside us and becomes a sorrow, and thelittle offense is brooded over till, in the hot-bed of rumination, itgrows into a great injury, under whose poisonous shadow springs uphatred and revenge.
<br> 
<br> Swearing relieves the feelings--that is what swearing does. Iexplained this to my aunt on one occasion, but it didn't answer withher. She said I had no business to have such feelings.
<br> 
<br> That is what I told Tittums. I told her she ought to be ashamed ofherself, brought up in at Christian family as she was, too. I don'tso much mind hearing an old cat swear, but I can't bear to see a merekitten give way to it. It seems sad in one so young.
<br> 
<br> I put Tittums in my pocket and returned to my desk. I forgot her forthe moment, and when I looked I found that she had squirmed out of mypocket on to the table and was trying to swallow the pen; then she puther leg into the ink-pot and upset it; then she licked her leg; thenshe swore again--at me this time.
<br> 
<br> I put her down on the floor, and there Tim began rowing with her. Ido wish Tim would mind his own business. It was no concern of hiswhat she had been doing. Besides, he is not a saint himself. He isonly a two-year-old fox-terrier, and he interferes with everything andgives himself the airs of a gray-headed Scotch collie.
<br> 
<br> Tittums' mother has come in and Tim has got his nose scratched, forwhich I am remarkably glad. I have put them all three out in thepassage, where they are fighting at the present moment. I'm in a messwith the ink and in a thundering bad temper; and if anything more inthe cat or dog line comes fooling about me this morning, it had betterbring its own funeral contractor with it.
<br> 
<br> Yet, in general, I like cats and dogs very much indeed. What jollychaps they are! They are much superior to human beings as companions.
<br> 
<br> They do not quarrel or argue with you. They never talk aboutthemselves but listen to you while you talk about yourself, and keepup an appearance of being interested in the conversation. They nevermake stupid remarks. They never observe to Miss Brown across adinner-table that they always understood she was very sweet on Mr.
<br> 
<br> Jones (who has just married Miss Robinson). They never mistake yourwife's cousin for her husband and fancy that you are thefather-in-law. And they never ask a young author with fourteentragedies, sixteen comedies, seven farces, and a couple of burlesquesin his desk why he doesn't write a play.
<br> 
<br> They never say unkind things. They never tell us of our faults,"merely for our own good." They do not at inconvenient moments mildlyremind us of our past follies and mistakes. They do not say, "Oh,yes, a lot of use you are if you are ever really wanted"--sarcasticlike. They never inform us, like our _inamoratas_ sometimes do, thatwe are not nearly so nice as we used to be. We are always the same tothem.
<br> 
<br> They are always glad to see us. They are with us in all our humors.
<br> 
<br> They are merry when we are glad, sober when we feel solemn, and sadwhen we are sorrowful.
<br> 
<br> "Halloo! happy and want a lark? Right you are; I'm your man. Here Iam, frisking round you, leaping, barking, pirouetting, ready for anyamount of fun and mischief. Look at my eyes if you doubt me. Whatshall it be? A romp in the drawing-room and never mind the furniture,or a scamper in the fresh, cool air, a scud across the fields and downthe hill, and won't we let old Gaffer Goggles' geese know what time o'
<br> 
<br> day it is, neither! Whoop! come along."Or you'd like to be quiet and think. Very well. Pussy can sit on thearm of the chair and purr, and Montmorency will curl himself up on therug and blink at the fire, yet keeping one eye on you the while, incase you are seized with any sudden desire in the direction of rats.
<br> 
<br> And when we bury our face in our hands and wish we had never beenborn, they don't sit up very straight and observe that we have broughtit all upon ourselves. They don't even hope it will be a warning tous. But they come up softly and shove their heads against us. If itis a cat she stands on your shoulder, rumples your hair, and says,"Lor,' I am sorry for you, old man," as plain as words can speak; andif it is a dog he looks up at you with his big, true eyes and sayswith them, "Well you've always got me, you know. We'll go through theworld together and always stand by each other, won't we?"He is very imprudent, a dog is. He never makes it his business toinquire whether you are in the right or in the wrong, never bothers asto whether you are going up or down upon life's ladder, never askswhether you are rich or poor, silly or wise, sinner or saint. You arehis pal. That is enough for him, and come luck or misfortune, goodrepute or bad, honor or shame, he is going to stick to you, to comfortyou, guard you, and give his life for you if need be--foolish,brainless, soulless dog!
<br> 
<br> Ah! old stanch friend, with your deep, clear eyes and bright, quickglances, that take in all one has to say before one has time to speakit, do you know you are only an animal and have no mind? Do you knowthat that dull-eyed, gin-sodden lout leaning against the post outthere is immeasurably your intellectual superior? Do you know thatevery little-minded, selfish scoundrel who lives by cheating andtricking, who never did a gentle deed or said a kind word, who neverhad a thought that was not mean and low or a desire that was not base,whose every action is a fraud, whose every utterance is a lie--do youknow that these crawling skulks (and there are millions of them in theworld), do you know they are all as much superior to you as the sun issuperior to rushlight you honorable, brave-hearted, unselfish brute?
<br> 
<br> They are MEN, you know, and MEN are the greatest, and noblest, andwisest, and best beings in the whole vast eternal universe. Any manwill tell you that.
<br> 
<br> Yes, poor doggie, you are very stupid, very stupid indeed, comparedwith us clever men, who understand all about politics and philosophy,and who know everything, in short, except what we are and where wecame from and whither we are going, and what everything outside thistiny world and most things in it are.
<br> 
<br> Never mind, though, pussy and doggie, we like you both all the betterfor your being stupid. We all like stupid things. Men can't bearclever women, and a woman's ideal man is some one she can call a "dearold stupid." It is so pleasant to come across people more stupid thanourselves. We love them at once for being so. The world must berather a rough place for clever people. Ordinary folk dislike them,and as for themselves, they hate each other most cordially.
<br> 
<br> But there, the clever people are such a very insignificant minoritythat it really doesn't much matter if they are unhappy. So long asthe foolish people can be made comfortable the world, as a whole, willget on tolerably well.
<br> 
<br> Cats have the credit of being more worldly wise than dogs--of lookingmore after their own interests and being less blindly devoted to thoseof their friends. And we men and women are naturally shocked at suchselfishness. Cats certainly do love a family that has a carpet in thekitchen more than a family that has not; and if there are manychildren about, they prefer to spend their leisure time next door.
<br> 
<br> But, taken altogether, cats are libeled. Make a friend of one, andshe will stick to you through thick and thin. All the cats that Ihave had have been most firm comrades. I had a cat once that used tofollow me about everywhere, until it even got quite embarrassing, andI had to beg her, as a personal favor, not to accompany me any furtherdown the High Street. She used to sit up for me when I was late homeand meet me in the passage. It made me feel quite like a married man,except that she never asked where I had been and then didn't believeme when I told her.
<br> 
<br> Another cat I had used to get drunk regularly every day. She wouldhang about for hours outside the cellar door for the purpose ofsneaking in on the first opportunity and lapping up the drippings fromthe beer-cask. I do not mention this habit of hers in praise of thespecies, but merely to show how almost human some of them are. If thetransmigration of souls is a fact, this animal was certainlyqualifying most rapidly for a Christian, for her vanity was onlysecond to her love of drink. Whenever she caught a particularly bigrat, she would bring it up into the room where we were all sitting,lay the corpse down in the midst of us, and wait to be praised. Lord!
<br> 
<br> how the girls used to scream.
<br> 
<br> Poor rats! They seem only to exist so that cats and dogs may gaincredit for killing them and chemists make a fortune by inventingspecialties in poison for their destruction. And yet there issomething fascinating about them. There is a weirdness anduncanniness attaching to them. They are so cunning and strong, soterrible in their numbers, so cruel, so secret. They swarm indeserted houses, where the broken casements hang rotting to thecrumbling walls and the doors swing creaking on their rusty hinges.
<br> 
<br> They know the sinking ship and leave her, no one knows how or whither.
<br> 
<br> They whisper to each other in their hiding-places how a doom will fallupon the hall and the great name die forgotten. They do fearful deedsin ghastly charnel-houses.
<br> 
<br> No tale of horror is complete without the rats. In stories of ghostsand murderers they scamper through the echoing rooms, and the gnawingof their teeth is heard behind the wainscot, and their gleaming eyespeer through the holes in the worm-eaten tapestry, and they scream inshrill, unearthly notes in the dead of night, while the moaning windsweeps, sobbing, round the ruined turret towers, and passes wailinglike a woman through the chambers bare and tenantless.
<br> 
<br> And dying prisoners, in their loathsome dungeons, see through thehorrid gloom their small red eyes, like glittering coals, hear in thedeath-like silence the rush of their claw-like feet, and start upshrieking in the darkness and watch through the awful night.
<br> 
<br> I love to read tales about rats. They make my flesh creep so. I likethat tale of Bishop Hatto and the rats. The wicked bishop, you know,had ever so much corn stored in his granaries and would not let thestarving people touch it, but when they prayed to him for foodgathered them together in his barn, and then shutting the doors onthem, set fire to the place and burned them all to death. But nextday there came thousands upon thousands of rats, sent to do judgmenton him. Then Bishop Hatto fled to his strong tower that stood in themiddle of the Rhine, and barred himself in and fancied he was safe.
<br> 
<br> But the rats! they swam the river, they gnawed their way through thethick stone walls, and ate him alive where he sat.
<br> 
<br> "They have whetted their teeth against the stones,And now they pick the bishop's bones;They gnawed the flesh from every limb,For they were sent to do judgment on him."Oh, it's a lovely tale.
<br> 
<br> Then there is the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, how first hepiped the rats away, and afterward, when the mayor broke faith withhim, drew all the children along with him and went into the mountain.
<br> 
<br> What a curious old legend that is! I wonder what it means, or has itany meaning at all? There seems something strange and deep lying hidbeneath the rippling rhyme. It haunts me, that picture of the quaint,mysterious old piper piping through Hamelin's narrow streets, and thechildren following with dancing feet and thoughtful, eager faces. Theold folks try to stay them, but the children pay no heed. They hearthe weird, witched music and must follow. The games are leftunfinished and the playthings drop from their careless hands. Theyknow not whither they are hastening. The mystic music calls to them,and they follow, heedless and unasking where. It stirs and vibratesin their hearts and other sounds grow faint. So they wander throughPied Piper Street away from Hamelin town.
<br> 
<br> I get thinking sometimes if the Pied Piper is really dead, or if hemay not still be roaming up and down our streets and lanes, butplaying now so softly that only the children hear him. Why do thelittle faces look so grave and solemn when they pause awhile fromromping, and stand, deep wrapt, with straining eyes? They only shaketheir curly heads and dart back laughing to their playmates when wequestion them. But I fancy myself they have been listening to themagic music of the old Pied Piper, and perhaps with those bright eyesof theirs have even seen his odd, fantastic figure gliding unnoticedthrough the whirl and throng.
<br> 
<br> Even we grown-up children hear his piping now and then. But theyearning notes are very far away, and the noisy, blustering world isalways bellowing so loud it drowns the dreamlike melody. One day thesweet, sad strains will sound out full and clear, and then we tooshall, like the little children, throw our playthings all aside andfollow. The loving hands will be stretched out to stay us, and thevoices we have learned to listen for will cry to us to stop. But weshall push the fond arms gently back and pass out through thesorrowing house and through the open door. For the wild, strangemusic will be ringing in our hearts, and we shall know the meaning ofits song by then.
<br> 
<br> I wish people could love animals without getting maudlin over them, asso many do. Women are the most hardened offenders in such respects,but even our intellectual sex often degrade pets into nuisances byabsurd idolatry. There are the gushing young ladies who, having read"David Copperfield," have thereupon sought out a small, longhaired dogof nondescript breed, possessed of an irritating habit of criticisinga man's trousers, and of finally commenting upon the same by a sniffindicative of contempt and disgust. They talk sweet girlish prattleto this animal (when there is any one near enough to overhear them),and they kiss its nose, and put its unwashed head up against theircheek in a most touching manner; though I have noticed that thesecaresses are principally performed when there are young men hangingabout.
<br> 
<br> Then there are the old ladies who worship a fat poodle, scant ofbreath and full of fleas. I knew a couple of elderly spinsters oncewho had a sort of German sausage on legs which they called a dogbetween them. They used to wash its face with warm water everymorning. It had a mutton cutlet regularly for breakfast; and onSundays, when one of the ladies went to church, the other alwaysstopped at home to keep the dog company.
<br> 
<br> There are many families where the whole interest of life is centeredupon the dog. Cats, by the way, rarely suffer from excess ofadulation. A cat possesses a very fair sense of the ridiculous, andwill put her paw down kindly but firmly upon any nonsense of thiskind. Dogs, however, seem to like it. They encourage their owners inthe tomfoolery, and the consequence is that in the circles I amspeaking of what "dear Fido" has done, does do, will do, won't do, cando, can't do, was doing, is doing, is going to do, shall do, shan'tdo, and is about to be going to have done is the continual theme ofdiscussion from morning till night.
<br> 
<br> All the conversation, consisting, as it does, of the very dregs ofimbecility, is addressed to this confounded animal. The family sit ina row all day long, watching him, commenting upon his actions, tellingeach other anecdotes about him, recalling his virtues, and rememberingwith tears how one day they lost him for two whole hours, on whichoccasion he was brought home in a most brutal manner by thebutcher-boy, who had been met carrying him by the scruff of his neckwith one hand, while soundly cuffing his head with the other.
<br> 
<br> After recovering from these bitter recollections, they vie with eachother in bursts of admiration for the brute, until some more thanusually enthusiastic member, unable any longer to control hisfeelings, swoops down upon the unhappy quadruped in a frenzy ofaffection, clutches it to his heart, and slobbers over it. Whereuponthe others, mad with envy, rise up, and seizing as much of the dog asthe greed of the first one has left to them, murmur praise anddevotion.
<br> 
<br> Among these people everything is done through the dog. If you want tomake love to the eldest daughter, or get the old man to lend you thegarden roller, or the mother to subscribe to the Society for theSuppression of Solo-Cornet Players in Theatrical Orchestras (it's apity there isn't one, anyhow), you have to begin with the dog. Youmust gain its approbation before they will even listen to you, and if,as is highly probable, the animal, whose frank, doggy nature has beenwarped by the unnatural treatment he has received, responds to yourovertures of friendship by viciously snapping at you, your cause islost forever.
<br> 
<br> "If Fido won't take to any one," the father has thoughtfully remarkedbeforehand, "I say that man is not to be trusted. You know, Maria,how often I have said that. Ah! he knows, bless him."Drat him!
<br> 
<br> And to think that the surly brute was once an innocent puppy, all legsand head, full of fun and play, and burning with ambition to become abig, good dog and bark like mother.
<br> 
<br> Ah me! life sadly changes us all. The world seems a vast horriblegrinding machine, into which what is fresh and bright and pure ispushed at one end, to come out old and crabbed and wrinkled at theother.
<br> 
<br> Look even at Pussy Sobersides, with her dull, sleepy glance, hergrave, slow walk, and dignified, prudish airs; who could ever thinkthat once she was the blue-eyed, whirling, scampering,head-over-heels, mad little firework that we call a kitten?
<br> 
<br> What marvelous vitality a kitten has. It is really something verybeautiful the way life bubbles over in the little creatures. Theyrush about, and mew, and spring; dance on their hind legs, embraceeverything with their front ones, roll over and over, lie on theirbacks and kick. They don't know what to do with themselves, they areso full of life.
<br> 
<br> Can you remember, reader, when you and I felt something of the samesort of thing? Can you remember those glorious days of fresh youngmanhood--how, when coming home along the moonlit road, we felt toofull of life for sober walking, and had to spring and skip, and waveour arms, and shout till belated farmers' wives thought--and with goodreason, too--that we were mad, and kept close to the hedge, while westood and laughed aloud to see them scuttle off so fast and made theirblood run cold with a wild parting whoop, and the tears came, we knewnot why? Oh, that magnificent young LIFE! that crowned us kings ofthe earth; that rushed through every tingling vein till we seemed towalk on air; that thrilled through our throbbing brains and told us togo forth and conquer the whole world; that welled up in our younghearts till we longed to stretch out our arms and gather all thetoiling men and women and the little children to our breast and lovethem all--all. Ah! they were grand days, those deep, full days, whenour coming life, like an unseen organ, pealed strange, yearnful musicin our ears, and our young blood cried out like a war-horse for thebattle. Ah, our pulse beats slow and steady now, and our old jointsare rheumatic, and we love our easy-chair and pipe and sneer at boys'
<br> 
<br> enthusiasm. But oh for one brief moment of that god-like life again!
