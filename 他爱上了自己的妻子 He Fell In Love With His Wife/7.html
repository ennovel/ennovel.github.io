<p>"Come in!" she cried, as she adjusted the shade of the lamp.</p> 
<p>A tall, thin, pale woman entered, carrying a child that was partly hidden by a thin shawl, their only outer protection against the chill winds which had been blustering all day.&nbsp; Alida looked at the stranger inquiringly and kindly, expecting an appeal for charity.&nbsp; The woman sank into a chair as if exhausted, and fixed her dark hollow eyes on Mrs. Ostrom.&nbsp; She appeared consumed by a terrible curiosity.</p> 
<p>Alida wondered at the strange chill of apprehension with which she encountered this gaze.&nbsp; It was so intent, so searching, yet so utterly devoid of a trace of good will.&nbsp; She began gently, "Can I do anything for you?"</p> 
<p>For a moment or two longer there was no response other than the same cold, questioning scrutiny, as if, instead of a sweet-faced woman, something monstrously unnatural was present.&nbsp; At last, in slow, icy utterance, came the words, "So you are--HER!"</p> 
<p>"Is this woman insane?" thought Alida. "Why else does she look at me so?&nbsp; Oh, that Wilson would come!&nbsp; I'm sorry for you, my good woman," she began kindly. "You are laboring under some mistake.&nbsp; My husband--"</p> 
<p>"YOUR husband!" exclaimed the stranger, with an indescribable accent of scorn and reproach.</p> 
<p>"Yes," replied Alida with quiet dignity. "MY husband will be home soon and he will protect me.&nbsp; You have no right to enter my rooms and act as you do.&nbsp; If you are sick and in trouble, I and my husband--"</p> 
<p>"Please tell me, miss, how he became YOUR husband?"</p> 
<p>"By lawful marriage, by my pastor."</p> 
<p>"We'll soon see how LAWFUL it was," replied the woman, with a bitter laugh. "I'd like you to tell me how often a man can be married lawfully."</p> 
<p>"What do you mean?" cried Alida, with a sudden flash in her blue eyes.&nbsp; Then, as if reproaching herself, she added kindly, "Pardon me.&nbsp; I see you are not well.&nbsp; You do not realize what you are saying or where you are.&nbsp; Take a seat nearer the fire, and when Mr. Ostrom comes from his work he'll take you to your friends."</p> 
<p>All the while she was speaking the woman regarded her with a hard, stony gaze; then replied, coldly and decisively, "You are wrong, miss"--how that title grated on Alida's ears!--"I am neither insane nor drunk.&nbsp; I do know what I am saying and where I am.&nbsp; You are playing a bold game or else you have been deceived, and very easily deceived, too.&nbsp; They say some women are so eager to be married that they ask no questions, but jump at the first chance.&nbsp; Whether deceived or deceiving, it doesn't matter now.&nbsp; But you and he shall learn that there is a law in the land which will protect an honest woman in her sacred rights.&nbsp; You needn't look so shocked and bewildered.&nbsp; You are not a young, giddy girl if I may judge from your face.&nbsp; What else could you expect when you took up with a stranger you knew nothing about?&nbsp; Do you know that likeness?" and she drew from her bosom a daguerreotype.</p> 
<p>Alida waved it away as she said indignantly, "I won't believe ill of my husband.&nbsp; I--"</p> 
<p>"No, miss," interrupted the woman sternly, "you are right for once.&nbsp; You won't indeed believe ill of YOUR husband, but you'll have to believe ill of MINE.&nbsp; There's no use of your putting on such airs any longer.&nbsp; No matter how rash and silly you may have been, if you have a spark of honesty you'll be open to proof.&nbsp; If you and he try to brazen it out, the law will open both your eyes.&nbsp; Look at that likeness, look at these letters; and I have other proof and witnesses which can't be disputed.&nbsp; The name of the man you are living with is not Wilson Ostrom.&nbsp; His name is Henry Ferguson.&nbsp; I am Mrs. Ferguson, and I have my marriage certificate, and--What!&nbsp; Are you going to faint?&nbsp; Well, I can wait till you recover and till HE comes," and she coolly sat down again.</p> 
<p>Alida had glanced at the proofs which the woman had thrust into her hands, then staggered back to a lounge that stood near.&nbsp; She might have fainted, but at that awful moment she heard a familiar step on the stairs.&nbsp; She was facing the door; the terrible stranger sat at one side, with her back toward it.</p> 
<p>When Ostrom entered he first saw Alida looking pale and ill.&nbsp; He hastened toward her exclaiming, "Why, Lida, dear, what is the matter?&nbsp; You are sick!"</p> 
<p>Instinctively she sprang to his arms, crying, "Oh, thank God!&nbsp; You've come.&nbsp; Take away this awful woman!"</p> 
<p>"Yes, Henry Ferguson; it's very proper you should take me away from a place like this."</p> 
<p>As the man who had called himself Wilson Ostrom heard that voice he trembled like an aspen; his clasp of Alida relaxed, his arms dropped to his side, and, as he sank into a chair and covered his face with his hands, he groaned, "Lost!"</p> 
<p>"Found out, you mean," was the woman's reply.</p> 
<p>Step by step, with horror-stricken eyes, Alida retreated from the man to whose protection and embrace she had flown. "Then it's true?" she said in a hoarse whisper.</p> 
<p>He was speechless.</p> 
<p>"You are willfully blind now, miss, if you don't see it's true," was the stranger's biting comment.</p> 
<p>Paying no heed to her, Alida's eyes rested on the man whom she had believed to be her husband.&nbsp; She took an irresolute step toward him. "Speak, Wilson!" she cried. "I gave you my whole faith and no one shall destroy it but yourself.&nbsp; Speak, explain!&nbsp; Show me that there's some horrible mistake."</p> 
<p>"Lida," said the man, lifting his bloodless face, "if you knew all the circumstances--"</p> 
<p>"She shall know them!" half shrieked the woman, as if at last stung to fury. "I see that you both hope to get through this affair with a little high tragedy, then escape and come together again in some other hiding place.&nbsp; As for this creature, she can go where she pleases, after hearing the truth; but you, Henry Ferguson, have got to do your duty by me and your child or go to prison.&nbsp; Let me tell you, miss, that this man was also married to me by a minister.&nbsp; I have my certificate and can produce witnesses.&nbsp; There's one little point you'll do well to consider," she continued, in bitter sarcasm, "he married me first.&nbsp; I suppose you are not so young and innocent as not to know where this fact places YOU.&nbsp; He courted and won me as other girls are courted and married.&nbsp; He promised me all that he ever promised you.&nbsp; Then, when I lost my rosy cheeks--when I became sick and feeble from child-bearing--he deserted and left me almost penniless.&nbsp; You needn't think you will have to take my word for this.&nbsp; I have proof enough.&nbsp; And now, Henry Ferguson, I've a few words for you, and then you must take your choice.&nbsp; You can't escape.&nbsp; I and my brother have tracked you here.&nbsp; You can't leave these rooms without going to prison.&nbsp; You'd be taken at the very door.&nbsp; But I give you one more chance.&nbsp; If you will promise before God to do your duty by me and your child, I'll forgive as far as a wronged woman can forgive.&nbsp; Neither I nor my brother will take proceedings against you.&nbsp; What this woman will do I don't know.&nbsp; If she prosecutes you, and you are true to me, I'll stand by you, but I won't stand another false step or a false word from you."</p> 
<p>Ferguson had again sunk into his chair, buried his face in his hands, and sat trembling and speechless.&nbsp; Never for an instant had Alida taken her eyes from him; and now, with a long, wailing cry, she exclaimed, "Thank God, thank God!&nbsp; Mother's dead."</p> 
<p>This was now her best consolation.&nbsp; She rushed into her bedchamber, and a moment later came out, wearing her hat and cloak.&nbsp; Ferguson started up and was about to speak, but she silenced him by a gesture, and her tones were sad and stern as she said, "Mr. Ferguson, from your manner more truly than from this woman, I learn the truth.&nbsp; You took advantage of my misfortunes, my sorrow and friendlessness, to deceive me.&nbsp; You know how false are your wife's words about my eagerness to be deceived and married.&nbsp; But you have nothing to fear from me.&nbsp; I shall not prosecute you as she suggests, and I charge you before God to do your duty by your wife and child and never to speak to me again."&nbsp; Turning, she hastened toward the door.</p> 
<p>"Where are you going?" Ferguson exclaimed, seeking to intercept her.</p> 
<p>She waved him off. "I don't know," she replied. "I've no right to be here," and she fled down the stairway and out into the darkness.</p> 
<p>The child had not wakened.&nbsp; It was well that it had not looked upon such a scene, even in utter ignorance of its meaning.</p>
