<p>"I must either sell or marry," he groaned, "and one's about as hard and bad as the other.&nbsp; Who'll buy the place and stock at half what they're worth, and where could I find a woman that would look at an old fellow like me, even if I could bring myself to look at her?"</p> 
<p>The poor man did indeed feel that he was shut up to dreadful alternatives.&nbsp; With his ignorance of the world, and dislike for contact with strangers, selling out and going away was virtually starting out on an unknown sea without rudder or compass.&nbsp; It was worse than that--it was the tearing up of a life that had rooted itself in the soil whereon he had been content from childhood to middle age.&nbsp; He would suffer more in going, and in the memory of what he had parted with, than in any of the vicissitudes which might overtake him.&nbsp; He had not much range of imagination or feeling, but within his limitations his emotions were strong and his convictions unwavering.&nbsp; Still, he thought it might be possible to live in some vague, unknown place, doing some kind of work for people with whom he need not have very much to do.&nbsp; "I've always been my own master, and done things in my own way," he muttered, "but I suppose I could farm it to suit some old, quiet people, if I could only find 'em.&nbsp; One thing is certain, anyhow--I couldn't stay here in Oakville, and see another man living in these rooms, and plowing my fields, and driving his cows to my old pasture lots.&nbsp; That would finish me like a galloping consumption."</p> 
<p>Every day he shrunk with a strange dread from the wrench of parting with the familiar place and with all that he associated with his wife.&nbsp; This was really the ordeal which shook his soul, and not the fear that he would be unable to earn his bread elsewhere.&nbsp; The unstable multitude, who are forever fancying that they would be better off somewhere else or at something else, can have no comprehension of this deep-rooted love of locality and the binding power of long association.&nbsp; They regard such men as Holcroft as little better than plodding oxen.&nbsp; The highest tribute which some people can pay to a man, however, is to show that they do not and cannot understand him.&nbsp; But the farmer was quite indifferent whether he was understood or not.&nbsp; He gave no thought to what people said or might say.&nbsp; What were people to him?&nbsp; He only had a hunted, pathetic sense of being hedged in and driven to bay.&nbsp; Even to his neighbors, there was more of the humorous than the tragic in his plight.&nbsp; It was supposed that he had a goodly sum in the bank, and gossips said that he and his wife thought more of increasing this hoard than of each other, and that old Holcroft's mourning was chiefly for a business partner.&nbsp; His domestic tribulations evoked mirth rather than sympathy; and as the news spread from farmhouse to cottage of his summary bundling of Bridget and her satellites out of doors, there were both hilarity and satisfaction.</p> 
<p>While there was little commiseration for the farmer, there was decided disapprobation of the dishonest Irish tribe, and all were glad that the gang had received a lesson which might restrain them from preying upon others.</p> 
<p>Holcroft was partly to blame for his present isolation.&nbsp; Remote rural populations are given to strong prejudices, especially against those who are thought to be well-off from an oversaving spirit; and who, worse still, are unsocial.&nbsp; Almost anything will be forgiven sooner than "thinking one's self better than the other folks;" and that is the usual interpretation of shy, reticent people.&nbsp; But there had been a decided tinge of selfishness in the Holcrofts' habit of seclusion; for it became a habit rather than a principle.&nbsp; While they cherished no active dislike to their neighbors, or sense of superiority, these were not wholly astray in believing that they had little place in the thoughts or interests of the occupants of the hill farm.&nbsp; Indifference begat indifference, and now the lonely, helpless man had neither the power nor the disposition to bridge the chasm which separated him from those who might have given him kindly and intelligent aid.&nbsp; He was making a pathetic effort to keep his home and to prevent his heart from being torn bleeding away from all it loved.&nbsp; His neighbors thought that he was merely exerting himself to keep the dollars which it had been the supreme motive of his life to accumulate.</p> 
<p>Giving no thought to the opinions of others, Holcroft only knew that he was in sore straits--that all which made his existence a blessing was at stake.</p> 
<p>At times, during these lonely and stormy March days, he would dismiss his anxious speculations in regard to his future course.&nbsp; He was so morbid, especially at night, that he felt that his wife could revisit the quiet house.&nbsp; He cherished the hope that she could see him and hear what he said, and he spoke in her viewless presence with a freedom and fullness that was unlike his old reticence and habit of repression.&nbsp; He wondered that he had not said more endearing words and given her stronger assurance of how much she was to him.&nbsp; Late at night, he would start out of a long reverie, take a candle, and, going through the house, would touch what she had touched, and look long and fixedly at things associated with her.&nbsp; Her gowns still hung in the closet, just as she had left them; he would take them out and recall the well-remembered scenes and occasions when they were worn.&nbsp; At such times, she almost seemed beside him, and he had a consciousness&nbsp; of companionship which soothed his perturbed spirit.&nbsp; He felt that she appreciated such loving remembrance, although unable to express her approval.&nbsp; He did not know it, but his nature was being softened, deepened, and enriched by these deep and unwonted experiences; the hard materiality of his life was passing away, rendering him capable of something better than he had ever known.</p> 
<p>In the morning all the old, prosaic problems of his life would return, with their hard, practical insistence, and he knew that he must decide upon something very soon.&nbsp; His lonely vigils and days of quiet had brought him to the conclusion that he could not hunt up a wife as a matter of business.&nbsp; He would rather face the "ever angry bears" than breathe the subject of matrimony to any woman that he could ever imagine himself marrying.&nbsp; He was therefore steadily drifting toward the necessity of selling everything and going away.&nbsp; This event, however, was like a coral reef to a sailor, with no land in view beyond it.&nbsp; The only thing which seemed certain was the general breaking up of all that had hitherto made his life.</p> 
<p>The offer of help came from an unexpected source.&nbsp; One morning Holcroft received a call from a neighbor who had never before shown any interest in his affairs.&nbsp; On this occasion, however, Mr. Weeks began to display so much solicitude that the farmer was not only surprised, but also a little distrustful.&nbsp; Nothing in his previous knowledge of the man had prepared the way for such very kindly intervention.</p> 
<p>After some general references to the past, Mr. Weeks continued, "I've been saying to our folks that it was too bad to let you worry on alone without more neighborly help.&nbsp; You ought either to get married or have some thoroughly respectable and well-known middle-aged woman keep house for you.&nbsp; That would stop all talk, and there's been a heap of it, I can tell you.&nbsp; Of course, I and my folks don't believe anything's been wrong."</p> 
<p>"Believing that something was wrong is about all the attention my neighbors have given me, as far as I can see," Holcroft remarked bitterly.</p> 
<p>"Well, you see, Holcroft, you've kept yourself so inside your shell that people don't know what to believe.&nbsp; Now, the thing to do is to change all that.&nbsp; I know how hard it is for a man, placed as you be, to get decent help.&nbsp; My wife was a-wondering about it the other day, and I shut her up mighty sudden by saying, 'You're a good manager, and know all the country side, yet how often you're a-complaining that you can't get a girl that's worth her salt to help in haying and other busy times when we have to board a lot of men.'&nbsp; Well, I won't beat around the bush any more.&nbsp; I've come to act the part of a good neighbor.&nbsp; There's no use of you're trying to get along with such haphazard help as you can pick up here and in town.&nbsp; You want a respectable woman for housekeeper, and then have a cheap, common sort of a girl to work under her.&nbsp; Now, I know of just such a woman, and it's not unlikely she'd be persuaded to take entire charge of your house and dairy.&nbsp; My wife's cousin, Mrs. Mumpson--" At the mention of this name Holcroft gave a slight start, feeling something like a cold chill run down his back.</p> 
<p>Mr. Weeks was a little disconcerted but resumed, "I believe she called on your wife once?"</p> 
<p>"Yes," the farmer replied laconically. "I was away and did not see her."</p> 
<p>"Well, now," pursued Mr. Weeks, "she's a good soul.&nbsp; She has her little peculiarities; so have you and me, a lot of 'em; but she's thoroughly respectable, and there isn't a man or woman in the town that would think of saying a word against her.&nbsp; She has only one child, a nice, quiet little girl who'd be company for her mother and make everything look right, you know."</p> 
<p>"I don't see what there's been to look wrong," growled the farmer.</p> 
<p>"Nothing to me and my folks, of course, or I wouldn't suggest the idea of a relation of my wife coming to live with you.&nbsp; But you see people will talk unless you stop their mouths so they'll feel like fools in doing it.&nbsp; I know yours has been a mighty awkward case, and here's a plain way out of it.&nbsp; You can set yourself right and have everything looked after as it ought to be, in twenty-four hours.&nbsp; We've talked to Cynthy--that's Mrs. Mumpson--and she takes a sight of interest.&nbsp; She'd do well by you and straighten things out, and you might do a plaguey sight worse than give her the right to take care of your indoor affairs for life."</p> 
<p>"I don't expect to marry again," said Holcroft curtly.</p> 
<p>"Oh, well!&nbsp; Many a man and woman has said that and believed it, too, at the time.&nbsp; I'm not saying that my wife's cousin is inclined that way herself.&nbsp; Like enough, she isn't at all, but then, the right kind of persuading does change women's minds sometimes, eh?&nbsp; Mrs. Mumpson is kinder alone in the world, like yourself, and if she was sure of a good home and a kind husband there's no telling what good luck might happen to you.&nbsp; But there'll be plenty of time for considering all that on both sides.&nbsp; You can't live like a hermit."</p> 
<p>"I was thinking of selling out and leaving these parts," Holcroft interrupted.</p> 
<p>"Now look here, neighbor, you know as well as I do that in these times you couldn't give away the place.&nbsp; What's the use of such foolishness?&nbsp; The thing to do is to keep the farm and get a good living out of it.&nbsp; You've got down in the dumps and can't see what's sensible and to your own advantage."</p> 
<p>Holcroft was thinking deeply, and he turned his eyes wistfully to the upland slopes of his farm.&nbsp; Mr. Weeks had talked plausibly, and if all had been as he represented, the plan would not have been a bad one.&nbsp; But the widower did not yearn for the widow.&nbsp; He did not know much about her, but had very unfavorable impressions.&nbsp; Mrs. Holcroft had not been given to speaking ill of anyone, but she had always shaken her head with a peculiar significance when Mrs. Mumpson's name was mentioned.</p> 
<p>The widow had felt it her duty to call and counsel against the sin of seclusion and being too much absorbed in the affairs of this world.</p> 
<p>"You should take an interest in everyone," this self-appointed evangelist had declared, and in one sense she lived up to her creed.&nbsp; She permitted no scrap of information about people to escape her, and was not only versed in all the gossip of Oakville, but also of several other localities in which she visited.</p> 
<p>But Holcroft had little else to deter him from employing her services beyond an unfavorable impression.&nbsp; She could not be so bad as Bridget Malony, and he was almost willing to employ her again for the privilege of remaining on his paternal acres.&nbsp; As to marrying the widow--a slight shudder passed through his frame at the thought.</p> 
<p>Slowly he began, as if almost thinking aloud, "I suppose you are right, Lemuel Weeks, in what you say about selling the place.&nbsp; The Lord knows I don't want to leave it.&nbsp; I was born and brought up here, and that counts with some people.&nbsp; If your wife's cousin is willing to come and help me make a living, for such wages as I can pay, the arrangement might be made.&nbsp; But I want to look on it as a business arrangement.&nbsp; I have quiet ways of my own, and things belonging to the past to think about, and I've got a right to think about 'em.&nbsp; I aint one of the marrying kind, and I don't want people to be a-considering such notions when I don't.&nbsp; I'd be kind and all that to her and her little girl, but I should want to be left to myself as far as I could be."</p> 
<p>"Oh, certainly," said Mr. Weeks, mentally chuckling over the slight prospect of such immunity, "but you must remember that Mrs. Mumpson isn't like common help--"</p> 
<p>"That's where the trouble will come in," ejaculated the perplexed farmer, "but there's been trouble enough with the other sort."</p> 
<p>"I should say so," Mr. Weeks remarked emphatically. "It would be a pity if you couldn't get along with such a respectable, conscientious woman as Mrs. Mumpson, who comes from one of the best families in the country."</p> 
<p>Holcroft removed his hat and passed his hand over his brow wearily as he said, "Oh, I could get along with anyone who would do the work in a way that would give me a chance to make a little, and then leave me to myself."</p> 
<p>"Well, well," said Mr. Weeks, laughing, "you needn't think that because I've hinted at a good match for you I'm making one for my wife's cousin.&nbsp; You may see the day when you'll be more hot for it than she is.&nbsp; All I'm, trying to do is to help you keep your place, and live like a man ought and stop people's mouths."</p> 
<p>"If I could only fill my own and live in peace, it's all I ask.&nbsp; When I get to plowing and planting again I'll begin to take some comfort."</p> 
<p>These words were quoted against Holcroft, far and near. "Filling his own mouth and making a little money are all he cares for," was the general verdict.&nbsp; And thus people are misunderstood.&nbsp; The farmer had never turned anyone hungry from his door, and he would have gone to the poorhouse rather than have acted the part of the man who misrepresented him.&nbsp; He had only meant to express the hope that he might be able to fill his mouth--earn his bread, and get it from his native soil. "Plowing and planting"--working where he had toiled since a child---would be a solace in itself, and not a grudged means to a sordid end.</p> 
<p>Mr. Weeks was a thrifty man also, and in nothing was he more economical than in charitable views of his neighbors' motives and conduct.&nbsp; He drove homeward with the complacent feeling that he had done a shrewd, good thing for himself and "his folks" at least.&nbsp; His wife's cousin was not exactly embraced in the latter category, although he had been so active in her behalf.&nbsp; The fact was, he would be at much greater pains could he attach her to Holcroft or anyone else and so prevent further periodical visits.</p> 
<p>He regarded her and her child as barnacles with such appalling adhesive powers that even his ingenuity at "crowding out" had been baffled.&nbsp; In justice to him, it must be admitted that Mrs. Mumpson was a type of the poor relation that would tax the long suffering of charity itself.&nbsp; Her husband had left her scarcely his blessing, and if he had fled to ills he knew not of, he believed that he was escaping from some of which he had a painfully distinct consciousness.&nbsp; His widow was one of the people who regard the "world as their oyster," and her scheme of life was to get as much as possible for nothing.&nbsp; Arrayed in mourning weeds, she had begun a system of periodical descents upon his relatives and her own.&nbsp; She might have made such visitations endurable and even welcome, but she was not shrewd enough to be sensible.&nbsp; She appeared to have developed only the capacity to talk, to pry, and to worry people.&nbsp; She was unable to rest or to permit others to rest, yet her aversion to any useful form of activity was her chief characteristic.&nbsp; Wherever she went she took the ground that she was "company," and with a shawl hanging over her sharp, angular shoulders, she would seize upon the most comfortable rocking chair in the house, and mouse for bits of news about everyone of whom she had ever heard.&nbsp; She was quite as ready to tell all she knew also, and for the sake of her budget of gossip and small scandal, her female relatives tolerated her after a fashion for a time; but she had been around so often, and her scheme of obtaining subsistence for herself and child had become so offensively apparent, that she had about exhausted the patience of all the kith and kin on whom she had the remotest claim.&nbsp; Her presence was all the more unwelcome by reason of the faculty for irritating the men of the various households which she invaded.&nbsp; Even the most phlegmatic or the best-natured lost their self-control, and as their wives declared, "felt like flying all to pieces" at her incessant rocking, gossiping, questioning, and, what was worse still, lecturing.&nbsp; Not the least endurable thing about Mrs. Mumpson was her peculiar phase of piety.&nbsp; She saw the delinquencies and duties of others with such painful distinctness that she felt compelled to speak of them; and her zeal was sure to be instant out of season.</p> 
<p>When Mr. Weeks had started on his ominous mission to Holcroft his wife remarked to her daughter confidentially, "I declare, sis, if we don't get rid of Cynthy soon, I believe Lemuel will fly off the handle."</p> 
<p>To avoid any such dire catastrophe, it was hoped and almost prayed in the Weeks household that the lonely occupant of the hill farm would take the widow for good and all.</p>
