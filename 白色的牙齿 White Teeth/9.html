Inevitably, O'Connell's. Simply because you could be without family in O'Connell's, without possessions or status, without past glory or future hope you could walk through that door with nothing and be exactly the same as everybody else in there. It could be 1989 outside, or 1999, or 2009, and you could still be sitting at the counter in the V-neck you wore toyour wedding in 1975,1945,1935. Nothing changes here, things are only retold, remembered. That's why old men love it. It's all about time. Not just its stillness but the pure, brazen amount of it.</p> 
<p>　　Quantity rather than Quality. This is hard to explain. If only there was some equation .. . something like:</p> 
<p>　　TIME SPENT HEREReason why IENJOYMENT x MASOCHISM =TIME THAT I COULD HAVEUSEFULLY SPENT ELSEWHEREam a regularSomething to rationalize, to explain, why one would keep returning, like Freud's grandson with his fort-da game, to the same miserable scenario. But time is what it comes down to. After you've spent a certain amount, invested so much of it in one place, your credit rating booms and you feellike breaking the chronological bank. You feel like staying in the place until it pays you back all the time you gave it even if it never will.</p> 
<p>　　And with the time spent, comes the knowledge, comes the history. It was at O'Connell's that Samad had suggested Archie's remarriage, 1974. Underneath table six in a pool of his own vomit, Archie celebrated the birth of Irie, 1975. There is a stain on theThe Root Canals ofMangal Pandecorner of the pinball machine where Samad first spilt civilian blood, with a hefty right hook to a racist drunk, 1980. Archie was downstairs the night he watched his fiftieth birthday float up through fathoms of whisky to meet him like an old shipwreck, 1977. And this is where they both came, New Year's Eve, 1989 (neither the Iqbal nor Jones families having expressed a desire to enter the 905 in their company), happy to take advantage of Mickey's special New Year fry-up: 2 pounds85 pence for three eggs, beans, two rounds of toast, mushrooms and a generous slice of seasonal turkey.</p> 
<p>　　The seasonal turkey was a bonus. For Archie and Samad, it was really all about being the witness, being the expert. They came here because they knew this place. They knew it inside and out. And if you can't explain to your kid why glass will shatter at certain impacts but not others, if you can't understand how a balance can be struck between democratic secularism and religious belief within the same state, or you can't recall the circumstances in which Germany was divided, then it feels good no, it feels great to know at least one particular place, one particular period, fromfirst-hand experience, eyewitness reports; to be the authority, to have time on your side, for once, for once. No better historians, no better experts in the world than Archie and Samad when it came to The Post-War Reconstruction and Growth ofO'Connell's Pool Hoitse.</p> 
<p>　　1952, All (Mickey's father), and his three brothers arrive at Dover with thirty old pounds and their father's gold pocket-watch. All suffer from disfiguring skin condition.</p> 
<p>　　1954-1963 Marriages; odd-jobs of all varieties; births of AbdulMickey, the five other Abduls and their cousins.</p> 
<p>　　1968 After working for three years as delivery boys in a Yugoslavian dry-cleaning outfit, All and his brothers have a small lump sum with which they set up a cab service called Ali's Cab Service.</p> 
<p>　　1971 Cab venture a great success. But All is dissatisfied. He decides what he really wants to do is 'serve food, make people happy, have some face to face conversations once in a while'. He buysthe disused Irish pool house next to the defunct railway station on the Finchley Road and sets about renovating it.</p> 
<p>　　1972 In the Finchley Road only Irish establishments do any real business. So despite his Middle Eastern background and the fact that he is opening a cafe and not a pool house, All decides to keep the original Irish name. He paints all the fittings orange and green, hangs pictures of racehorses andregisters his business name as "Andrew O'Connell Yusuf. Out of respect, his brothers encourage him to hang fragments of the Qur'an on the wall, so that the hybrid business will be 'kindly looked upon'.</p> 
<p>　　13 May 1973 O'ConnelTs opens for business.</p> 
<p>　　2 November 1974 Samad and Archie stumble upon O'ConnelTs on their way home and pop in for a fry-up.</p> 
<p>　　1975 All decides to carpet the walls to limit food stains.</p> 
<p>　　May 1977 Samad wins fifteen bob on fruit machine.</p> 
<p>　　1979 All has a fatal heart attack due to cholesterol buildup around the heart. Ali's remaining family decide his death is a result of the unholy consumption of pork products. Pig is banned from the menu.</p> 
<p>　　1980 Momentous year. Abdul-Mickey takes over O'Connell's. Institutes underground gambling room to make up for the money lost on sausages. Two large pool tables are used: the "Death' table and the "Life' table. All those who want to play for money play on the "Death' table. All those who object for religious reasons or because out of pocket play on the friendly "Life' table. Scheme a great success. Samad and Archie play on the "Death* table.</p> 
<p>　　December 1980 Archie gets highest ever recorded score on pinball: 51,998 points.</p> 
<p>　　1981 Archie finds unwanted cut-out of Viv Richards on Self ridges shop floor and brings it to O'ConnelTs. Samad asks to have his great-grandfather Mangal Pande's picture on the wall. Mickey refuses, claiming his 'eyes are too close together'.</p> 
<p>　　1982 Samad stops playing on the "Death' table for religious reasons. Samad continues to petition for the picture's installation. 31 October 1984 Archie wins 268 pounds 72 pence on the "Death' table. Buys beautiful new set of Pirelli tyres for clapped-out car. New Year's Eve 1989,10.30 p.m. Samad finally persuadesMickey to hang portrait. Mickey still thinks it 'puts people off their food'.</p> 
<p>　　"I still think it puts people off their food. And on New Year's Eve. I'm sorry, mate. No offence meant. "Course my opinion's not the fucking word of God, as it were, but it's still my opinion."Mickey attached a wire round the back of the cheap frame, gave the dusty glass a quickwipe-down with his apron, and reluctantly placed the portrait on its hook above the oven.</p> 
<p>　　"I mean, he's so bloody nasty-looking. That moustache. He looks like a right nasty piece of work. And what's that earring about? He's not a queer, is he?""No, no, no. It wasn't unusual, then, for men to wear jewellery."Mickey was dubious, giving Samad the look he gave to people who claimed to have got no game of pinball for their 5op and came seeking a refund. He got out from behind the counter and took a look at the picture from this new angle. "What d'you think, Arch?""Good," said Archie solidly. "I think: good.""Please. I would consider it a great personal favour if you would allow it to stay."Mickey tilted his head to one side and then the other. "As I said, I don't mean no offence or nothing, I just think he looks abit bloody shady. Haven't you got another picture of him or som mink"That is the only one that survives. I would consider it a great personal favour, very great.""Well.. ." ruminated Mickey, flipping an egg over, 'you being a regular, as it were, and you going on about it so bloody much, I suppose we'll have to keep it. How about a public survey?</p> 
<p>　　What d'you think Denzel? Clarence?"Denzel and Clarence were sitting in the corner as ever, their only concession to New Year's Eve a few pieces of mangy tinsel hanging off Denzel's trilby and a feathered kazoo sharing mouth space with Clarence's cigar.</p> 
<p>　　"Was dat?""I said, what d'you think of this bloke Samad wants up? It's his grandfather.""Gmt-grandfather," corrected Samad.</p> 
<p>　　"You kyan see me playing dominoes? You tryin' to deprive an ol' man of his pleasure? Whatpicture?" Denzel grudgingly turned to look at it. "Dat? Hmph! I don' like it. He look like one of Satan's crew!" "He a relative of you?" squeaked Clarence to Samad in his woman's voice. "Dat explain much, my friend, much! He got some face like a donkey's pumpum."Denzel and Clarence exploded into their dirty laughter. "Nuff to put my belly off its digesting,true sur!""There you are!" exclaimed Mickey, victorious, turning back to Samad. "Puts the clientele off their food that's what I said right off.""Assure me you are not going to listen to those two.""I don't know .. ." Mickey twisted and turned in front of his cooking; hard thought always enlisted the involuntary help of his body. "I respect you and that, and you was mates with my dad, but no disrespect or nuffin' you're getting a bit fucking long-in-the tooth, Samad mate, some of the younger customers might not '</p> 
<p>　　"What younger customers?" demanded Samad, gesturing to Clarence and Denzel.</p> 
<p>　　"Yeah, point taken .. . but the customer is always right, if you set my drift."Samad was genuinely hurt. 7 am a customer. I am a customer. I have been coming to your establishment for fifteen years, Mickey. A very long time in any man's estimation.""Yeah, but it's the majority wot counts, in nit On most other tings I defer, as it were, to your opinion. The lads call you "The Professor" and, fair dues, it's not without cause. I am a respecter of your judgement, six days out of every seven. But bottom line is: if you're one captain and the rest of the crew wants a bloody mutiny, well.. . you're fucked, aren't you?"Mickey sympathetically demonstrated the wisdom of this in his frying pan, showing how twelve mushrooms could force one mushroom over the edge and on to the floor.</p> 
<p>　　With the cackles of Denzel and Clarence still echoing in his ears, a current of anger worked its way through Samad and rose to his throat before he was able to stop it.</p> 
<p>　　"Give it to me!" He reached over the counter to where Mangal Pande was hanging at a melancholy angle above the stove. "I should never have asked ... it would be a dishonour, it would cast into ignominy the memory of Mangal Pande to have him placed here in this this irreligious house of shame!""You what?""Give it to me!""Now look .. . wait a minute'</p> 
<p>　　Mickey and Archie reached out to stop him, but Samad, distressed and full of the humiliations of the decade, kept struggling to overcome Mickey's strong blocking presence. They tussled for a bit, but then Samad's body went limp and, covered in a light film of sweat, he surrendered. "Look, Samad," and here Mickey touched Samad's shoulders with such affection that Samad thought he might weep. "I didn't realize it was such a bloody big deal for you. Let's start again. We'll leave the picture up for aweek and see how it goes, right?""Thank you, my friend." Samad pulled out a handkerchief and drew it over his forehead. "It is appreciated. It is appreciated."Mickey gave him a conciliatory pat between the shoulder blades. "Fuck knows, I've heard enough about him over the years. We might as well 'ave him up on the bloody wall. It's all the same to me, I suppose. Comme-See-Comme-Sar, as the Frogs say. I mean, bloody hell. Blood-ee-hell.</p> 
<p>　　And that extra turkey requires hard cash, Archibald, my good man. The golden days of Luncheon Vouchers is over. Dear oh dear, what a palaver over nuffin' .. ."Samad looked deep into his great-grandfather's eyes. They had been through this battle many times, Samad and Pande, the battle for the latter's reputation. Both knew all too well that modern opinion on Mangal Pande weighed in on either side of two camps:</p> 
<p>　　An unrecognized hero A palaver over nuffin'</p> 
<p>　　Samad Iqbal MickeyA. S. Misra Magid and MillatAlsanaMeClarence and DenzelBritish scholarship from 1857 to the present dayAgain and again he had argued the toss with Archie over this issue. Over the years they had sat in O'Connell's and returned to the same debate, sometimes with new information gleaned from Samad's continual research into the matter but ever since Archie found out the 'truth' about Pande, circa 1953, there was no changing his mind. Pande's only claim to fame, as Archie was at pains to point out, was his etymological gift to the English language by way of the word"Pandy', under which title in the OED the curious reader will find the following definition:</p> 
<p>　　Pandy /'pandi/n. 2 colloq. (now Hist.) Also -dee. Mip [Perh. f. the surname of the first mutineer amongst the high-caste sepoys in the Bengal army.] i Any sepoy who revolted in the Indian Mutiny of 1857-9 2 Any mutineer or traitor 3 Any fool or coward in a military situation.</p> 
<p>　　"Plain as the pie on your face, my friend." And here Archie would close the book with an exultant slam. "And I don't need a dictionary to tell me that but then neither do you. It's common parlance. When you and me were in the army: same. You tried to put one over on me once, but the truth will out, mate. "Pandy" only ever meant one thing. If I were you, I'd start playing down the family connection, rather than bending everybody's ear twenty-four hours a bloody day.""Archibald, just because the word exists, it does not follow that it is a correct representation ofthe character of Mangal Pande. The first definition we agree on: my great-grandfather was a mutineer and I am proud to say this. I concede matters did not go quite according to plan. But traitor? Coward? The dictionary you show me is old these definitions are now out of currency. Pande was no traitor and no coward.""Ahhh, now, you see, we've been through this, and my thought is this: there's no smoke without fire," Archie would say, looking impressed by the wisdom of his own conclusion. "Know what I mean?" This was one of Archie's preferred analytic tools when confronted with news stories, historical events and the tricky day-to-day process of separating fact from fiction. There's no smoke without fire. There was something so vulnerable in the way he relied on this conviction, that Samad had never had the heart to disabuse him of it. Why tell an old man that there can be smoke without fire as surely as there are deep wounds that draw no blood?</p> 
<p>　　"Of course, I see your point of view, Archie, I do. But my point is, and has always been, from the very first time we discussed the subject; my point is that this is not theA uH story. And, yes, I realize that we have several times thoroughly investigated the matter, but the fact remains: full stories are as rare as honesty, precious as diamonds. If you are lucky enough to uncover one, a full story will sit on your brain like lead. They are difficult. They are long-winded. They are epic. Theyare like the stories God tells: full of impossibly particular information. You don't find them in the dictionary.""All right, all right, Professor. Let's hear your version."Often you see old men in the corner of dark pubs, discussing and gesticulating, using beer mugs and salt-cellars to represent long-dead people and far-off places. At that moment they display a vitality missing in every other area of their lives. They light up. Unpacking a full story on to the table here is Churchill-fork, over there is Czechoslovakia-serviette, here we find the accumulation of German troops represented by a collection of cold peas they are reborn. But when Archie and Samad had these tabletop debates during the eighties, knives and forks were not enough. The whole of the steamy Indian summer of 1857, the whole of that year of mutiny and massacre would be hauled into O'ConnelTs and brought to semi-consciousness by these two makeshift historians. The area stretching from the jukebox to the fruit machine became Delhi; Viv Richards silently complied as Pande's English superior, Captain Hearsay; Clarence and Denzel continued to play dominoeswhile simultaneously being cast as the restless sepoy hordes of the British army. Each man brought the pieces of his argument, laid them out and assembled them for the other to see. Scenes were set. Paths of bullets traced. Disagreement reigned.</p> 
<p>　　1010 The Root Canals of Mongol Pande -1According to the legend, during the spring of 1857 in a factory in Dum-Dum, a new kind of British bullet went into production. Designed to be used in English guns by Indian soldiers, like most bullets at the time they had a casing that must be bitten in order to fit the barrel. There seemed nothing exceptional about them,until it was discovered by some canny factory worker that they were covered in a grease a grease made from the fat of pigs, monstrous to Muslims, and the fat ofcows, sacred to Hindus. It was an innocent mistake as far as anything is innocent on stolen land an infamous British blunder. But what a feverish turmoil must have engulfed the people on first hearing the news! Under the specious pretext of new weaponry, the English were intending to destroy their caste, their honour, their standing in the eyes of Gods and men everything, in short, that made life worth living. A rumour like this could not be kept secret; it spread like wildfirethrough the dry lands of India that summer, down the production line, out on to the streets, through town houses and country shacks, through barrack after barrack, until the whole country was ablaze with the desire for a mutiny. The rumour reachedthe large unsightly ears of Mangal Pande, an unknown sepoy in the small town of Barrackpore, who swaggered into his parade ground 29 March 1857 stepping forward from the throng to make a certain kind of history. "Make a fool of himself,more like," Archie will say (for these days he does not swallow Pandy-ology as gullibly as he once did).</p> 
<p>　　"You totally misunderstand his sacrifice," Samad will reply.</p> 
<p>　　"What sacrifice? He couldn't even kill himself properly! The problem with you, Sam, is you won't listen to the evidence. I've read up on it all. The truth is the truth, no matter how nasty it may taste.""Really. Well, please, my friend, since you are apparently an expert in the doings of my family, please, enlighten me. Let us hear your version."Now, the average school student nowadays is aware of the complex forces, movements anddeep currents that motivate wars and spark revolutions. But when Archie was in school the world seemed far more open to its own fictionalization. History was a different business then: taught with one eye on narrative, the other on drama, no matter how unlikely or chronologically inaccurate.</p> 
<p>　　According to this schema, the Russian Revolution began because everyone hated Rasputin. The Roman Empire declined and fell because Antony was having it off with Cleopatra. Henry V triumphed at Agincourt because the French were too busy admiring their own outfits. And the Great Indian Mutiny of 1857 began when a drunken fool called Mangal Pande shot a bullet. Despite Samad's opposition, each time Archie read the following he found himself more convinced:</p> 
<p>　　The scene is Barrackpore, the date 29 March 1857. It is Sunday afternoon; but on the dusty floor of the parade ground a drama is being enacted which is suggestive of anything but Sabbath peace. There chatters and sways and eddies a confused mass of Sepoys, in all stages of dress and undress; some armed, some unarmed; but Tall fermenting with excitement. Some thirty yards infront of the line of the 34th swaggers to and fro a Sepoy named Mangal Pande. He is half drunk with bhang, and wholly drunk with religious fanaticism. Chin in air, loaded musket in hand, he struts backwards and forwards, at a sort of half dance, shouting in shrill and nasal monotone, "Come out, you blackguards! Turn out, all of you! The English are upon us. Through biting thesecartridges we shall all be made infidels!"The man, in fact, is in that condition of mingled bhang and 'nerves' which makes a Malay run amok; and every shout from his lips runs like a sudden flame through the brains and along the nerves of the listening crowd of fellow Sepoys, as the crowd gets bigger, the excitement more intense. A human powder magazine, in a word, is about to explode.</p> 
<p>　　And explode it did. Pande shot at his lieutenant and missed him. Then he took out a large sword, a tulwar, and cowardly lunged while his lieutenant's back was turned, catching him on the shoulder.</p> 
<p>　　A sepoy tried to restrain him, but Pande battled on. Then came reinforcements: one Captain Hearsay rushed forward, his son at his side, both armed and honourable and prepared to die for their country. ("Hear-say is precisely what it is! Rubbish. Fabrication!") At which point Pande saw the game was up, pointed his enormous gun at his own head and dramatically pulled the trigger with his left foot. He missed. A few days later, Pande stood trial and was found guilty. From theother side of the country, on a chaise longue in Delhi, his execution was ordered by one General Henry Havelock (a man honoured, much to Samad's fury, by a statue just outside the Palace Restaurant, Trafalgar Square, to the right of Nelson), who added in a postscript to his written instruction that he did hope that this would put an end to all the rash talk of mutiny one kept hearing recently. But it was too late. As Pande swung in the sultry breeze, hanging from a makeshift gallows, his disbanded comrades from the 34th were heading for Delhi, determined to join the rebel forces of what was to become one of the bloodiest failed mutinies of this or any century.</p> 
<p>　　This version of events by a contemporary historian named Fitchett was enough to send Samad into spasms of fury. When a man has nothing but his blood to commend him, each drop of it matters, matters terribly; it must be jealously defended. It must be protected against assailants anddetractors. It must be fought for. But like a Chinese whisper, Fitchett's intoxicated, incompetent Pande had passed down a line of subsequent historians, the truth mutating, bending, receding as the whisper continued. It didn't matter that bhang, a hemp drink taken in small doses for medicinal purposes, was extremely unlikely to cause intoxication of this kind or that Pande, a strict Hindu, was extremely unlikely to drink it. It didn't matter that Samad could find not one piece of corroborating evidence that Pande had taken bhang that morning. The story still clung, like a gigantic misquote, to the Iqbal reputation, as solid and seemingly irremovable as the misconception that Hamlet ever said he knew Yorick 'well'.</p> 
<p>　　"Enough! It makes no difference how many times you read these things to me, Archibald."(Archie usually came armed with a plastic bag full of Brent Library books, anti-Pande propaganda, misquotes galore.) "It is like a gang of children caught with their hands in an enormous honey jar:</p> 
<p>　　they are all going to tell me the same lie. I am not interested in this kind of slander. I am not interested in puppet theatre or tragic farce. Action interests me, friend." And here Samad would mime the final zipping up of his lips, the throwing away of a key. "True action. Not words. I tellyou, Archibald, Mangal Pande sacrificed his life in the name of justice for India, not because he was intoxicated or insane. Pass me the ketchup."It was the 1989 New Year's Eve shift in O'Connell's, and the debate was in full swing.</p> 
<p>　　"True, he was not a hero in the way you in the West like your heroes he did not succeed exceptin the manner of his honourable death. But imagine it: there he sat." Samad pointed to Denzel, about to play his winning domino. "At the trial, knowing death was upon him, refusing ever to reveal the names of his fellow conspirators '</p> 
<p>　　"Now, that," said Archie, patting his pile of sceptics, Michael Edwardes, P. J. O. Taylor, Syed Moinul Haq and the rest, 'depends what you read.""No, Archie. That is a common mistake. The truth does not depend on what you read. Please let us not get into the nature of truth. Then you do not have to draw with my cheese and I can avoid eating your chalk.""All right, then: Pande. What did he achieve? Nothing! All he did was start a mutiny too early, mind, before the agreed date and excuse my French, but that's a fucking disaster in military The Root Canab ofMangal Pande terms. You plan, you don't act on instinct. He caused unnecessary casualties. English and Indian/"With respect, I don't believe that to be the case.""Well, you're wrong.""With respect, I believe I am right.""It's like this, Sam: imagine here' he gathered a pile of dirty plates that Mickey was about to put in the dishwasher 'are all the people who have written about your Pande in the last hundred-and-whatever years. Now: here's the ones that agree with me." He placed ten plates on his side of the table and pushed one over to Samad. "And that's the madman on your side.""A. S. Misra. Respected Indian civil servant. Not a madman.""Right. Well, it would take you at least another hundred-and whatever years to get as many plates as I have, even if you were going to make them all yourself, and the likelihood is, once you had them, no bugger would want to eat off them anyway. Metaphorically speaking. Know what I mean?"Which left only A. S. Misra. One of Samad's nephews, Rajnu, had written to him in the spring of '81 from his Cambridge college, mentioning casually that he had found a book which might be of some interest to his uncle. In it, he said, could be found an eloquent defence of their shared ancestor, one Mangal Pande. The only surviving copy was in his college library, it was by a man named Misra. Had he heard of it already? If not, might it not serve (Rajnu added in a cautious P. S.) as a pleasant excuse to see his uncle again?</p> 
<p>　　Samad arrived on the train the very next day and stood on the platform, warmly greeting his soft-spoken nephew in the pouring rain, shaking his hand several times and talking as if it were going out of fashion. "A great day," he repeated over and over, until both men were soaked to the skin. "A great dayfor our family, Rajnu, a great day for the truth."Wet men not being allowed in college libraries, they spent the morning drying off in a stuffy upstairs cafe, full of the right type of ladies having the right type of tea. Rajnu, ever the good listener, sat patiently as his uncle babbled wildly Oh, the importance of the discovery, Oh, how long he had waited for this moment nodding in all the right places and smiling sweetly as Samad brushed tears from the corners of his eyes. "It is a great book, isn't it, Rajnu?" asked Samad pleadingly, as his nephew left a generous tip for the sour-faced waitresses who did not appreciate overexcited Indians spending three hours over one cream tea and leaving wet prints all over the furniture. "It is recognized, isn't it?"Rajnu knew in his heart that the book was an inferior, insignificant, forgotten piece of scholarship, but he loved his uncle, so he smiled, nodded and smiled firmly again.</p> 
<p>　　Once in the library, Samad was asked to fill in the visitors' book:</p> 
<p>　　Name: Samad Miah IqbalCollege: Educated elsewhere (Delhi)Research project: TruthRajnu, tickled by this last entry, picked up the pen, adding 'and Tragedy'.</p> 
<p>　　"Truth and Tragedy," said a deadpan librarian, turning the book back round. "Any particular kind?""Don't worry," said Samad genially. "We'll find it."It took a stepladder to reach it but it was well worth the stretch. When Rajnu passed the book to his uncle, Samad felt his fingers tingle and, looking at its cover, shape and colour, saw that it was all he had dreamt of. It was heavy, many paged, bound in a tan leather and covered in the light dust that denotes something incredibly precious, something rarely touched.</p> 
<p>　　"I left a marker in it. There is much to read but there issomething I thought you'd like to see first," said Rajnu, laying it down on a desk. The heavy thud of one side of the book hit the table, and Samad looked at the appointed page. It was more than he could have hoped for.</p> 
<p>　　"It's only an artist's impression, but the similarity between' "Don't speak," said Samad, tracinghis fingers across the picture. "This is our blood, Rajnu. I never thought I would see .. . Whateyebrows! What a nose! I have his nose!""You have his face, Uncle. More dashing, naturally." "And what what does it say underneath.</p> 
<p>　　Damn! Where are my reading glasses .. . read it for me, Rajnu, it is too small."The caption? Mangal Pande fired the first bullet of the 1857 movement. His self-sacrifice gave the siren to the nation to take up arms against an alien ruler, culminating in a mass-uprising with no parallel in world history. Though the effort failed in its immediate consequences, it succeeded in laying the foundations of the Independence to be won in 1947. For his patriotism he paid with his life. But until his last breath he refused to disclose the names of those who were preparing for, and instigating, the great uprising."Samad sat down on the bottom rung of the stepladder and wept.</p> 
<p>　　"So. Let me get this straight. Now you're telling me that without Pande there'd be no Gandhi.</p> 
<p>　　That without your mad gran dad there'd be no bloody Independence'</p> 
<p>　　"Great-gran dad"No, let me finish, Sam. Is that what you're seriously asking us' Archie clapped an uninterested Clarence and Denzel on the back 'to believe? Do you believe it?" he asked Clarence.</p> 
<p>　　The kyan believe dat!" said Clarence, having no idea of the topic.</p> 
<p>　　Denzel blew his nose into a napkin. "Troof be tol, me nah like to believe any ting. Hear no evil,see no evil, speak no evil. Dat my motto.""He was the tickle in the sneeze, Archibald. It is as simple as that. I do believe that."There was quiet for a minute. Archibald watched three sugar cubes dissolve in his teacup. Then,rather tentatively, he said, "I've got my own theory, you know. Separate from the books, I mean."Samad bowed. "Please enlighten us.""Don't get angry, now .. . But just think for a minute. Why is a strict religious man like Pandedrinking bhang? Seriously, I know I tease you about it. But why is he?""You know my opinion on that. He isn't. He didn't. It was English propaganda.""And he was a good shot...""No doubt about it. A. S. Misra produces a copy of a record stating that Pande trained in aspecial guard for one year, specially trained in the use of muskets.""OK. So: why does he miss? Why?""It is my belief that the only possible explanation is that the gun was faulty.""Yes .. . there is that. But, maybe, maybe something else. Maybe he was being bullied intogoing out there and making a row, you know, goaded, by the other guys. And he didn't want to killanyone in the first place, you know. So he pretended to be drunk, so the boys in the barracks roomwould believe he missed the shot.""That is quite the stupidest theory I have ever heard," sighed Samad, as the second hand ofMickey's egg-stained clock started the thirty-second countdown to midnight. "The kind only youcould come up with. It's absurd.""Why?""Why? Archibald, these Englishmen, these Captain Hearsays, Havelocks and the rest, wereevery Indian's mortal enemy. Why should he spare lives he despised?""Maybe he just couldn't do it. Maybe he wasn't the type.""Do you really believe there is a type of man who kills and a type of man who doesn't?""Maybe Sam, maybe not.""You sound like my wife," groaned Samad, mopping up a final piece of egg, 'let me tell yousomething, Archibald. A man is a man is a man. His family threatened, his beliefs attacked, his wayof life destroyed, his whole world coming to an end he will kill. Make no mistake. He won't let thenew order roll over him without a struggle. There will be people he will kill.""And there will be people he will save," said Archie Jones, with a cryptic look his friend wouldhave thought an impossible feat for those sagging, chubby features. "Trust me.""Five! Four! Tree! Two! One! Jamaica Me!" said Denzel and Clarence, raising hot Irish coffeesto each other in a toast, then immediately resuming round nine of the dominoes.</p>
