The time was half-past eleven in the forenoon of Boxing Day, and the daily delivery of letters had just taken place. It was naturally a little later than usual, but Mr. Teesdale wished with all his heart that there had been no delivery at all. At length he raised a tired face from his bad news, and let his eyes rest for the comfort of his spirit upon the red head and fringe of his solitary companion in the parlour. Missy was seated on the sofa, and all of her but the top of her head and the bottom of her dress, with a finger or two of each hand, was hidden behind the Argus newspaper. Missy always liked to see the Argus as soon as it came, though by that time it was never less than a day old, because Mr. Teesdale had it from a friend when the friend was done with it. This morning, as usual, he had handed it to the girl before opening his letters. He now sat staring absently at the girl's hair, and was therefore somewhat slow to notice that the narrow strip of forehead under the fringe was gone so white that it was difficult to tell where paper ended and forehead began. No sooner had David seen this, however, than he saw also the paper jumping up and down in the girl's grasp; whereupon the unpleasant letter in his own hands went straightway out of his head.
<br> 
<br> "Missy," he cried, "what's the matter, my dear? What have you seen?"
<br> 
<br> Missy dashed down the paper and was on her feet in an instant. There was extraordinary spirit in the action, and her eyes were very bright.
<br> 
<br> "What have I seen?" she repeated, in a tone that suppressed excitement rather than concern. "Nothing; that is, nothing that could interest any of you; only something about a friend of mine."
<br> 
<br> Yet she bounced out of the room without another word, and forthwith went in search of Arabella.
<br> 
<br> She found her in the dairy, which was half under the ground, and wholly out of the way.
<br> 
<br> "Arabella," she cried wildly, "put down that bowl and shake hands. We're safe!"
<br> 
<br> Now Arabella was not a person of quick perceptions. She was imaginative, she was inquisitive, she had a romantic side which had very nearly been the ruin of her at the responsible age of thirty-two. Like the parent whom she so strongly resembled in her undiscerning nature and easygoing temperament, she was sufficiently credulous, weak, and unwise in her generation. On the other hand, she was by no means without her father's merits. She had the same talent for affection, the same positive genius for uncommon gratitude. She could never make light of a good turn, not even in her own mind; nor out of her own mouth could she make too much of one. In the family circle she had been very silent and subdued during these last days, but to Missy in private she had opened a contrite and a very grateful heart more times than the other had liked to listen. Vague doubts and suspicions of Missy she had entertained in the beginning; she might have them still; nay, they might well be stronger than ever, after yesterday.
<br> 
<br> But one thing was now certain concerning these shy misgivings; they might rise to the mind, but they would never again pass the lips. No matter what Missy did or said, henceforth, Arabella would shield her with all the ingenuity at her command: which was not a little: only it was sometimes hindered by a certain slowness to perceive which frequently accompanies a constitutional readiness to imagine. So when Missy wanted her to shake hands because they were safe, Arabella looked perfectly blank.
<br> 
<br> "How are we safe?" she asked. "What are we safe from?"
<br> 
<br> "Why, from your friend."
<br> 
<br> "My friend? Ah!" She understood now.
<br> 
<br> "Yes, he won't trouble us much more," pursued Missy, sidling rhythmically from one foot to the other, while her eyes lit up the dairy. "O 'Bella, 'Bella, if you knew how I feel——"
<br> 
<br> "Stop a moment," said Arabella, white as the milk that she had spilled in her agitation; "is he—is he—dead?"
<br> 
<br> "Dead? I wish he was. No, no; he's only in prison."
<br> 
<br> "In prison?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes; run in the day before Christmas Eve—the day after I swep' him out o' this—no, the very day itself. See where you'd ha' been! 'Bella, 'Bella, let's drink his health in a pint of cream! It seems too good to be true."
<br> 
<br> But Arabella was grasping with both hands the shelf which supported the bowls of milk for creaming, and her face was drawn and wretched.
<br> 
<br> "Don't, Missy!" she exclaimed with tears in her voice. "You wouldn't if you knew how sorry I am. What is he in prison for? What has he been doing?"
<br> 
<br> "Writing a cheque he had no business to write and getting the money. That's what it was this time. But it isn't the first time; no, don't you believe it."
<br> 
<br> "I am so sorry," repeated Arabella, covering her eyes.
<br> 
<br> "But why? What for?"
<br> 
<br> "For him. I—I thought I loved him."
<br> 
<br> "You thought you loved him," Missy repeated buoyantly. She was all buoyancy now. "Yes, many a girl has thought that before you, my dear. And them that thought it too long, they didn't come to think they hated him. Not they! They jolly soon knew!"
<br> 
<br> The other's wet eyes were wide open.
<br> 
<br> "How is this, Missy? You seem to know all about him. You never told me that before."
<br> 
<br> "No, I didn't. What was the use when I'd got rid of him—for the time being, anyway? I was very much afraid he'd turn up again, and I was keeping what I knew until he did. I thought it'd be time enough to tell you then; but I'll tell you now if you like. It makes no difference one way or the other, now that our friend's in quod. Very well then, as soon as ever I heard his voice that dark night I knew that I'd heard it before. Never mind where—maybe in England, maybe on the ship, maybe after I landed in Melbourne. You mustn't want to know too much. It's good enough, isn't it, that I knew what sort he was, and that when I'd known him before he was sailing under another name altogether? Yes, I thought that'd knock you! You knew Stanborough, I knew Mowbray, and the police, they've run in a man of the name of Paolo Verini, alias Thomas Stanborough, alias Paul Mowbray. 'A handsome man of foreign appearance,' the Argus says. You may look for yourself. But if that isn't good enough for you I don't know what is."
<br> 
<br> "It might be someone else for all that," murmured Arabella, shuddering at the thought of the man in prison. "Have you any other reason for making so certain that it is the same?"
<br> 
<br> "I have. I wouldn't tell you before, but now what does it matter? I've expected him turning up every hour since that night. He swore that he would; and he would have, you may depend, if he hadn't got run in."
<br> 
<br> Arabella was silent; she felt that also. She had never been able to understand how a man of so firm a purpose as her lover should have made so facile a capitulation to a mere girl like Missy. Presently she asked a question:
<br> 
<br> "Did he recognise you. Missy?"
<br> 
<br> "No," replied Missy, after a little hesitation. "No, he did not," she repeated more firmly. "And look you here,'Bella, take my advice and never give him another thought. He was a bad egg, that's what he was; you may thank your stars that he is where he is, as I thank mine."
<br> 
<br> "I can't help being sorry," sighed Arabella, wiping her eyes with her apron; "but that doesn't make me less thankful to you, Missy. You've saved me, body and soul. I was under a spell, but you broke it. I don't understand it. I can't feel it now. But God knows how I felt it then, and what would have got me but for you! So I can never be thankful enough to you, Missy, and I shall never, never be able to tell you how thankful I am."
<br> 
<br> "Then never try," said Missy lightly; "only think kindly of me when you find it a hard job. That's all you've got to try to do."
<br> 
<br> And with a light-hearted laugh and a kiss from the fingers Missy was out of the dairy and above ground in the brilliant noonday sun.
<br> 
<br> There was no one about in the yard. Missy was glad of that, because there was no living soul whom she desired to see or to speak to for hours to come. The naked sword hanging over her head had suddenly been lifted down, snapped, and thrown away; she must be alone to appreciate that. Nevertheless this should be her last day at the farm; and again, she must be alone to make the most of the last day. Alone to consider all things, especially the life lying ahead; alone to drink for the last time of the sweet sensations of this peaceful spot, and so deeply, that the taste should be with her till her dying day. Then she would depart in peace; and lastly, she must be alone to invent the why and wherefore of this departure.
<br> 
<br> So she opened the gate leading out of the yard, and going down through the gum-trees into that shallow gully, she mounted the other side, and stopped to stand in triumph under the very tree from behind which Stanborough, or Verini, had sprung and caught her in his arms. She pictured him in his cell at that moment, with only one small iron-barred square of that blue sky which was all for her; and she drew into her throat and nostrils a long draught of eucalyptus perfume. This was one of the sensations which she desired always to remember. At length, still sniffing and glancing ever at the deep blue sky above the tree-tops, yet with both eyes and ears attentive to her friends the parrots, she turned sharp to the left, crossed the road below the Cultivation, and struck into the thick of the timber on the further side.
<br> 
<br> She had shut out of her light mind every thought of penitence and remorse. There was no further occasion for her to take a serious view of the situation. The very air seemed charged with a new and most delicious sense of freedom; enough, for the present, to revel in this, without thinking of anything at all. Another comparatively new sense, that of her own iniquity, was a dead nerve for the time being. Missy was too thankful for what she had escaped to consider what she deserved; indeed, she had considered this sufficiently. On the other hand, she was enjoying a natural reaction in the most natural manner imaginable. All by herself, among the gum-trees, she burst into song, or rather the snatch of one. And on the whole one would call it unconscious song, for the snatch ran—
<br> 
<br> 
<br> "You should 'a' seen 'im jump!
<br> 
<br> I didn't give a dump!
<br> 
<br> For I yells to 'is pals
<br> 
<br> 'Now look at him, gals—
<br> 
<br> 'Arry 'e 'as the——'"
<br> 
<br> 
<br> Here it broke off. Missy halted too.
<br> 
<br> "Morning, John William," said she.
<br> 
<br> He was standing in front of her, with his gun under his arm and a dead hare in the other hand. He returned her salute gravely. Then—
<br> 
<br> "You seem very happy," he said, with a spice of bitterness.
<br> 
<br> "Oh, I haven't got it," laughed Missy, "have you?"
<br> 
<br> "Got what?"
<br> 
<br> "The 'ump."
<br> 
<br> He shook his head and grinned; as he looked at her the grin broadened.
<br> 
<br> "So I didn't shock your head off, either!" exclaimed Missy.
<br> 
<br> "Not likely. I thought it was splendid myself."
<br> 
<br> "Then why did you look so glum just now?"
<br> 
<br> "Missy, I didn't——"
<br> 
<br> "You did! I thought you'd caught the 'ump from 'Arry. I believe you have. You're looking as glum as ever again!"
<br> 
<br> It was true. But he said:
<br> 
<br> "Missy, I don't feel a bit glum."
<br> 
<br> "No?"
<br> 
<br> She was examining him coolly, critically, and he knew it.
<br> 
<br> "Not a bit!" he reiterated, hacking out a tuft of grass with his right heel. Then his miserable eyes rose fiercely upon the girl. She had been waiting for this look, however.
<br> 
<br> "You are making a great mistake," she said, "if you are imagining yourself the least little atom in love with me."
<br> 
<br> For the instant her outspokenness enraged him; then it made him meek.
<br> 
<br> "I am imagining no such thing, Missy; I know it. But I also know that it is a mistake—when you are so far above me."
<br> 
<br> "There you go! That is your mistake. It's the other way about—it's you that's so far above me. John William, if you only knew what a bad lot I am—-"
<br> 
<br> "I don't care what you are."
<br> 
<br> "You don't know what I am. That's just it! I'm not what you think I am, I'm not what I make myself out to be; I'm not—I'm not!"
<br> 
<br> She was speaking passionately, being, in fact, once more on the verge of a full confession. All in a moment the impulse had come over her, and nothing could have stopped her but the thing that did. John William was not listening to a word she said; he was only gazing in her eyes.
<br> 
<br> "I don't care what you are, Missy; I shouldn't care if you were as black as sin! No, I should like it, for the blacker you were, the nearer I should be to you—the more chance I should have. If you were bad—which is all nonsense—you would still be too good for me; but I should love you, Missy, whether or no. I shall love you all my days!" He looked at her once with ravening eyes, and then spun round upon his heel. She called him back in a broken voice to tell him everything; but he shook his head without looking round, and the tree-trunks closed behind him like a door. Then Missy drew a very long breath, wiped her eyes, and sat down to think.
<br> 
<br> Her conscience was wide awake now. For an hour she let it tear and rend her. By the end of the second hour she had hardened her heart once more.
<br> 
<br> "I'm not meant to confess, that's evident," she exclaimed aloud. "I was a little fool ever to think of it."
<br> 
<br> A little fool, at that rate, she continued to be; inasmuch as for yet another hour she permitted her mind to dwell upon her attempted confessions, to old Teesdale yesterday, to John William to-day. It hurt her to think of the kindness and credulity of those two. It hurt her so much that she wept bitterly, only thinking of old David and John William his son. Yet she was thankful they had not listened, she was thankful they did not know, she was doubly thankful that she was to go away of her own accord, and without being found out after all. If she could ever make the slightest atonement! But that was for future thought.
<br> 
<br> The afternoon was well advanced when Missy once more crossed the road below the Cultivation. She was now in a perfectly philosophic frame of mind. Also she had slightly altered her plans. She would not invent an excuse for her departure; she would go without saying a word to any of them; she would run away in the night. And she would leave all her things behind her. The present value of them would not go far towards redeeming Mr. Teesdale's watch; still they must be worth something.
<br> 
<br> This she was thinking as she came to the end of the gum-trees, and opened the gate which was grown familiar to her hand and eye. Then suddenly she reflected that dinner must long be over, that she would barely be in time for tea. And the goodness of Mrs. Teesdale's tea was the next thought that filled her mind: she had the smell in her nostrils, she could almost feel the hot fluid coursing over her parched palate as she rounded the hen-yard and caught sight of the verandah. Thereat she came to a sudden standstill, and yet another new set of thoughts. The verandah was half hidden by a two-horse buggy drawn up in front of it.
<br> 
<br> "More visitors!" said Missy. "Well, I won't shock this lot. I wonder who they are? They must be swells!"
<br> 
<br> In fact, a man in livery held the reins, the afternoon sun made fireworks with the burnished harness, and the buggy was a very good one indeed.
<br> 
<br> Missy kept her eyes upon it as she approached the house. She never saw the faces that appeared for an instant at the parlour window and then disappeared. Her foot was lifted, to be set down in the verandah, when the door was flung open, and Mrs. Teesdale marched forth.
<br> 
<br> "Stand back!" she screamed. "Not another step! You would dare to set foot inside my doors again!"
<br> 
<br> Missy fell back in wonderment. As she did so a dainty-looking young lady appeared in the doorway behind Mrs. Teesdale, and screwed up her fair face at the glare of the afternoon sun. And Missy left off wondering, for in an instant she knew who that dainty-looking young lady must be.
