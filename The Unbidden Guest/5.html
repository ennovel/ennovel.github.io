His connection with the house was very characteristic. Many years before the landlord had served him in a menial capacity, but for nearly as many that worthy had been infinitely more prosperous than poor David, who, indeed, had never prospered at all. They were good friends, however, for the farmer had a soul too serene for envy, and a heart too simple to be over-sensitive concerning his own treatment at the hands of others. Thus he never resented his old hand's way with him, which would have cut envy, vanity, or touchiness, to the quick. He came to this inn for the sake of old acquaintance; it never occurred to him to go elsewhere; nor had he ever been short or sharp with his landlord before this evening, when, instead of answering questions and explaining what had brought him into Melbourne twice in one day, Mr. Teesdale flung the reins to the ostler, and himself out of the yard, with the rather forbidding reply that he was there on business. He was, indeed; though the business was the birth of the last half-hour.
<br> 
<br> It led him first to a little bare office overlooking a yard where many milk-carts stood at ease with their shafts resting upon the ground; and the other party to it was a man for whom Mr. Teesdale was no match.
<br> 
<br> "I must have twenty pounds," said David, beginning firmly.
<br> 
<br> "When?" replied the other coolly.
<br> 
<br> "Now. I shan't go home without it."
<br> 
<br> "I am very sorry, Mr. Teesdale, but I'm afraid that you'll have to."
<br> 
<br> "Why should I," cried David, smacking his hand down on the table, "when you owe me a hundred and thirty? Twenty is all I ask, for I know how you are situated; but twenty I must and shall have."
<br> 
<br> "We simply haven't it in the bank."
<br> 
<br> "Nay, come, I can't believe that."
<br> 
<br> "I'll show you the pass-book."
<br> 
<br> "I won't look at it. No, I shall put the matter into the hands of a solicitor. Good evening to you. I dare say it isn't your fault; but I must have some satisfaction, one way or the other. I am not going on like this a single day longer."
<br> 
<br> "Good evening, then, Mr. Teesdale. If you do what you say, we shall have to liquidate; and then you will get nothing at all, or very little." David had heard this story before. "It was an evil day for me when I sent you my first load of milk," he cried out bitterly; but in the other's words there had been such a ring of truth as took all the sting out of his own.
<br> 
<br> "It will be a worse one for us when you send me your last," replied the man of business. "That would be enough to finish us in itself, without your solicitor, in our present state; whereas, if you give us time——"
<br> 
<br> "I have given you too much time already," said the farmer, heaving the sigh which was ever the end of all his threats; and with a sudden good-humoured resignation (which put his nature in a nutshell), he got up and went away, after an amicable discussion on the exceeding earliness of summer with the man for whom he was no match at all. Throughout his life there had been far too many men who were more than a match for poor David in all such matters.
<br> 
<br> But the getting of the twenty pounds was a matter apart. He did not want it for himself; the person in need of the money was the child of his dear old friend, who had charged her to apply to him, David, in precisely that kind of difficulty which had already arisen. The fact made the old man's heart hot on one side and cold on the other; for while it glowed with pride at the trust reposed in him, it froze within his breast at the thought of his own helplessness to fulfil that trust. This, however, was a thought which he obstinately refused to entertain. He had not twenty pounds in the bank; on the contrary, his account was overdrawn to the utmost limit. For himself, he would have starved rather than borrow from his friend the innkeeper; but he could have brought himself to do so for Miriam, had he not been perfectly certain that his old servant would refuse to lend. In all Melbourne there was no other to whom he could go for the twenty pounds; yet have it he must, by hook or crook, that night; and ten minutes after his fruitless interview with the middleman who sold his milk, a way was shown him.
<br> 
<br> He was hanging about the corner of Bourke and Elizabeth Streets, watching the multitude with an absent, lack-lustre eye; the post-office clock had chimed the hour overhead, and David, still absently, had taken his own cherished watch from his waistcoat pocket to check its time. It was not on his last day in Melbourne, nor on his last but one, that the watch had been set by the post-office clock, yet it was still right to the minute; and before the eighth clang from above had been swallowed in the city's hum, David had got his idea. He closed the gold case with a decisive snap, and next moment went in feverish quest of the nearest pawnbroker.
<br> 
<br> It was with a face strangely drawn between joy and regret, between guilt and triumph, that Mr. Teesdale at length returned to his inn. Here, in the writing-room, now with the scared frown of a forger, and now with a senile giggle, he cowered over a blotting-pad for some minutes; and thereafter returned to the post-office with a sealed envelope, which he shot into safety with his own hands. It was well after nine before the horse was put to, and David seated once more in the buggy, with the collar of his dust-coat turned up about his ears and the apron over his long lean legs.
<br> 
<br> "Never knew you so late before, old man," said his former servant, who was smoking a cigar in the yard, and perhaps still thinking of his first snub from David Teesdale.
<br> 
<br> "No, I don't think you ever did," replied David, blandly.
<br> 
<br> "Second time in to-day, too."
<br> 
<br> "Second time in," repeated Mr. Teesdale, drawing the reins through his fingers.
<br> 
<br> "And it'll take you a good hour to get home. I say, you'll be getting into trouble. You won't be there before——What time is it now, old man?"
<br> 
<br> "Look at the post-office," said David, as he took up his whip.
<br> 
<br> "I can't see it without going out into the street; besides, I always thought they took their time from that wonderful watch of yours?"
<br> 
<br> "You're a clever fellow!" cried David, as the other had never heard him speak in the whole course of their previous acquaintance; and he was gone without another word.
<br> 
<br> He drove away with a troubled face; but the Melbourne street-lamps showed deeper furrows under the old tall hat than David carried with him into the darkness beyond the city, for the more he thought of it, the surer did he become that his late action was not only defensible, but rather praiseworthy into the bargain. There was about it, moreover, a dramatic fitness which charmed him no less because he did not know the name for it. Throughout his unsuccessful manhood he had treasured a watch, which was as absurd in his pocket as a gold-headed cane in a beggarman's hand, because Oliver had given it to him. For years it must have mocked him whenever he took it from his shabby pocket, but in the narrowest straits he had never parted with it, nor had his gold watch ever ceased to be David Teesdale's most precious possession. And now, after two-and-thirty years, he had calmly pawned it, on the spur of the moment, and, as it seemed to himself, for the most extraordinary and beautiful reason in the world; for what he could never bring himself to do in his own need he had done in a moment for the extravagant behoof of his friend's daughter; and his heart beat higher than for many a year in the joy of his deed. So puffed up was he, indeed, that he forgot the fear of Mrs. Teesdale, and some other things besides; for at the foot of the last hill, within a mile of the farm, the horse shied so suddenly that David, taken off his guard, found his near wheels in the ditch before he could haul in the slack of the reins; and when another plunge might have overturned the buggy, a man ran out of the darkness to the horse's head, and before David could realise what had happened his ship had righted itself and was at anchor in the middle of the road.
<br> 
<br> "My fault, as I'm a sinner!" cried a rich voice from near the horse's ears.
<br> 
<br> "Nay, I'm very much obliged to you," said Mr. Teesdale, with a laugh, for he made no work of a bit of danger, much less when past.
<br> 
<br> "But it was me your horse shied at," returned the other, and fell to petting the frightened animal with soft words and a soothing hand. "I was going to take the liberty of stopping you for a moment."
<br> 
<br> "I never saw you," said David; "it was that dark, and I was that busy thinking. What is it I can do for you? The horse 'll stand steady now, thank you, if you'll come this way."
<br> 
<br> The wayfarer came round to the buggy wheels and stood still, feeling in all his pockets before answering questions. The near lamp shot its rays upon a broad, deep chest, and showed a pair of hairy hands searching one pocket after another. The rays reached as high as a scarlet neckcloth, but no higher, so that the man's face was not very easily visible; and David was only beginning to pick out of the night a heavy moustache, and a still heavier jaw, when from between the two there came the gleam of teeth, and the fellow was laughing a little and swearing more. He had given up his search, and stood empty-handed under the lamp.
<br> 
<br> "I'm not a bushranger," said he, "but you might easily think me one."
<br> 
<br> "Why so?" asked David.
<br> 
<br> "Because I stopped you to ask for a match to light my pipe, and now I'm hanged if I can find my pipe in any of my pockets; and it was the best one ever I smoked," said the man, with more of his oaths.
<br> 
<br> "That's a bad job," said David, sympathetically, in spite of a personal horror of bad language, which was one of his better peculiarities.
<br> 
<br> "A bad job?" cried the man. "It would be that if I'd lost my pipe, but it's a damned sight worse when it's a girl that goes and shakes it from you, and she the biggest little innocent you ever clapped eyes on. Yet she must have shook it. Confound her face!"
<br> 
<br> He was feeling in his pockets again, but as unsuccessfully as before. The farmer inquired whether he was on his way back to Melbourne, and suggested it was a long walk.
<br> 
<br> "It is so," said the man; "but it's a gay little town when you get there, is Melbourne—what?"
<br> 
<br> "Very," said Mr. Teesdale, to be civil; but he was beginning to find this difficult.
<br> 
<br> "You prefer the country—what?" continued the other, who was now leaning on the wheel, and showing a face which the old man liked even less than the rest of him, it was so handsome and yet so coarse. "Well, so do I, for a change. And talk of the girls!" The fellow winked. "Old Country or Colonies, it's all the same—you give me a country lass for a lark that's worth having. But damn their souls when they lose your favourite pipe!"
<br> 
<br> "What sort of a pipe was it?" asked David, to change a conversation which he disliked. "If I come across it I'll send it to you, if you tell me where to."
<br> 
<br> "Good, old man!" cried the stranger. "It was a meerschaum, with a lady's hand holding of the bowl, and coloured better than any pipe ever you saw in your life. If you do find it, you leave it with the boss of the 'Bushman's Rest'; then I'll get it again when next I come this way—to see my girl. For I can't quite think she's the one to have touched it, when all's skid and done."
<br> 
<br> "Very good," said David, coldly, because both look and word of this roadside acquaintance were equally undesirable in his eyes. "Very good, if I find it. And now, if you'll allow me, I'll push on home."
<br> 
<br> The other showed himself as ready with a sneer as with an oath. "You are in a desperate hurry!" said he.
<br> 
<br> "I am," said David; "nevertheless, I'm much obliged to you for being so clever with the horse just now, and I wish you a very good night." And with that, showing for once some little decision, because this kind of man repelled him, old Tees-dale cracked his whip and drove on without more ado.
<br> 
<br> Nor is it likely he would have thought any more about so trifling an incident, but for another which occurred before he finally reached home. It was at his own slip-rails, not many minutes later; he had got down and taken them out, and was in the act of leading through, when his foot kicked something hard and small, so that it rattled against one of the rails, and shone in the light of the buggy lamp at the same instant. The farmer stopped to pick it up, found it a meerschaum pipe, and pulled a grave face over it for several moments. Then he slipped it into his pocket, and after putting up the rails behind him, was in his own yard in three minutes. Here one of the men took charge of horse and buggy, and the master went round to the front of the house, but must needs stand in the verandah to spy on Arabella, who was sitting with her Family Cherub under the lamp and the blind never drawn. She was not reading; her head was lifted, and she was gazing at the window—at himself, David imagined; but he was wrong, for she never saw him. Her face was flushed, and there was in it a wonder and a stealthy joy, born of the romantic reading under her nose, as the father thought; but he was wrong again; for Arabella had finished one chapter before the coming of Missy, and had sat an hour over the next without taking in a word.
<br> 
<br> "So you've got back, father?" she was saying presently, in an absent, mechanical sort of voice.
<br> 
<br> "Here I am," said Mr. Teesdale; "and I left Missy at the theatre, where it appears she had to meet——"
<br> 
<br> "Missy!" exclaimed Arabella, remembering very suddenly. "Oh yes! Of course. Where do you say you left her, father?"
<br> 
<br> "At the Bijou Theatre, my dear, I am sorry to say; but it wasn't her fault; it was the friends she is staying with whom she had to meet there. Well, let's hope it won't do her any harm just once in a way. And what have you been doing, my dear, all the evening?"
<br> 
<br> "I? Oh, after milking I had a bit of a stroll outside."
<br> 
<br> "A stroll, eh? Then you didn't happen to see a man hanging about our slip-rails, did you?"
<br> 
<br> Mr. Teesdale was emptying his pockets, with his back to Arabella, so he never knew how his question affected her.
<br> 
<br> "I wasn't near the slip-rails, I was in the opposite direction," she said presently. "Why do you ask?"
<br> 
<br> "Because I found this right under them," said Mr. Teesdale, showing her the meerschaum pipe before laying it down on the chimney-piece; "and as I was getting near the township, I met a man who told me he'd lost just such a pipe. And I didn't like him, my dear, so I only hope he's not coming after our Mary Jane, that's all."
<br> 
<br> Mary Jane was the farm-servant. She had not been out of the kitchen since milking-time, said Arabella; and her father was remarking that he was glad to hear this, when the door flew open, and Mrs. Teesdale whistled into the room like a squall of wind.
<br> 
<br> "At last!" she cried. "Do you know how long you've been, David? Do you know what time it is?"
<br> 
<br> "I don't, my dear," said he.
<br> 
<br> "Then look at your watch."
<br> 
<br> "My dear," he said, "I've left my watch in Melbourne."
<br> 
<br> "In Melbourne!" cried Mrs. Teesdale among her top notes. "And what's the meaning of that?"
<br> 
<br> "It means," said Mr. Teesdale, struggling to avoid the lie direct, "that it hasn't been cleaned for years, and that it needed cleaning very badly indeed."
<br> 
<br> "But you told Miriam how well it was going; time we were having our teas!"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, I know, and—that's the curious thing, my dear. It went and stopped on our way in." For there was no avoiding it, after all; yet in all the long years of their married life, it was his first.
