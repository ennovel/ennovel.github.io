Janice has completed one pair of ten?week courses and is into another. She has long phone conversations with her classmates about the next quiz or the fascinating personality of their teacher, Mr. Lister with his exciting new beard. "I'm sure Nelson has some plan," she says. "And if he doesn't, we'll all sit down and negotiate one."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Negotiate! Two hundred thousand disappearing dollars! And you don't have Toyotas to sell any more."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Were they really so great, Harry? Nelson hated them. Why can't we get an American franchise ? isn't Detroit making a big comeback?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Not so big they can afford Nelson Angstrom."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She pretends he's joking, saying, "Aren't you awful?" Then she looks at his face, is startled and saddened by what she sees there, and crosses their kitchen to reach up and touch his face. "Harry," she says. "You are taking it hard. Don't. Daddy used to say, `For every up there's a down, and for every down there's an up.' Nelson will be home in a week and we can't do a thing really until then." Outside the kitchen window screen, where moths keep bumping, the early?August evening has that blended tint peculiar to the season, of light being withdrawn while summer's warmth remains. As the days grow shorter, a dryness of dead grass and chirring insects has crept in even through this summer of heavy rains, of more thunderstorms and flash floods in Diamond County than Harry can ever remember. Out in their yard, he notices now a few brown leaves shed by the weeping cherry, and the flower stalks of the violet hosta dying back. In his mood of isolation and lassitude he is drawing closer to the earth, the familiar mother with his infancy still in her skirts, in the shadows beneath the bushes.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Shit," he says, a word charged for him with magic since the night three months ago when Pru used it to announce her despairing decision to sleep with him, once. "What kind of plans can Nelson have? He'll be lucky to stay out of jail."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You can't go to jail for stealing from your own family. He had a medical problem, he was sick the same way you were sick only it was addiction instead of angina. You're both getting better."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He hears in the things she says, more and more, other voices, opinions and a wisdom gathered away from him. "Who have you been talking to?" he says. "You sound like that know?it?all Doris Kaufmann."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Eberhardt. I haven't talked to Doris for weeks and weeks. But some of the women taking the real?estate program, we go out afterwards to this little place on Pine Street that's not too rough, at least until later, and one of them, Francie Alvarez, says you got to think of any addiction as a medical condition just like they caught the flu, or otherwise you'd go crazy, blaming the addicts around you as if they can help it."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"So what makes you think Nelson's cure will take? Just because it cost us six grand, that doesn't mean a thing to the kid. He just went in to let things blow over. You told me yourself he told you once he loves coke more than anything in the world. More than you, more than me, more than his own kids."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Well, sometimes in life you have to give up things you love."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Charlie. Is that who she's thinking of, to make her voice sound so sincere, so sadly wise and wisely firm? Her eyes for this moment in dying August light have a darkness that invites him in, to share a wisdom her woman's life has taught her. Her fingers touch his cheek again, a touch like a fly that when you're trying to fall asleep keeps settling on your face, the ticklish thin skin here and there. It's annoying; he tries to shake her off with a snap of his head. She pulls her hand back but still stares so solemnly. "It's you I worry about, more than Nelson. Is the angina coming back? The breathlessness?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"A twinge now and then," he admits. "Nothing a pill doesn't fix. It's just something I'm going to have to live with."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I wonder if you shouldn't have had the bypass."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"The balloon was bad enough. Sometimes I feel like they left it inside me."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Harry, at least you should do more exercise. You go from the lot to the TV in the den to bed. You never play golf any more."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Well, it's no fun with the old gang gone. The kids out there at the Flying Eagle don't want an old man in their foursome. In Florida I'll pick it up again."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"That's something else we ought to talk about. What's the point of my getting the salesperson's license if we go right down to Florida for six months? I can never build up any local presence."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Local presence, you've got lots of it. You're Fred Springer's daughter and Harry Angstrom's wife. And now you're a famous coke addict's mother."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I mean professionally. It's a phrase Mr. Lister uses. It means the people know you're always there, not off in Florida like some person who doesn't take her job seriously."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"So," he says. "Florida was good enough to stash me in when I was manager at Springer Motors, to get me out of Nelson's way, but now you think you're a working girl we can just forget it, Florida."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Well," Janice allows, "I was thinking, one possibility, to help with the company's debts, might be to sell the condo."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Sell it? Over my dead body," he says, not so much meaning it as enjoying the sound of his voice, indignant like one of those perpetually outraged fathers on a TV sitcom, or like silver?haired Steve Martin in the movie Parenthood, which they saw the other night because one of Janice's real?estate buddies thought it was so funny. "My blood's got too thin to go through a Northern winter."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In response Janice looks as if she is about to cry, her darkbrown eyes warm and glassy?looking just like little Roy's before he lets loose with one of his howls. "Harry, don't confuse me," she begs. "I can't even take the license exam until October, I can't believe you'd immediately make me go down to Florida where the license is no good just so you can play golf with some people older and worse than you. Who beat you anyway, and take twenty dollars every time."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Well what am 1 supposed to do around here while you run around showing off? The lot's finished, kaput, or whatever the Japanese word is, finito, and even if it's not, if the kid's half?way straightened out you'll want him back there and he can't stand me around, we crowd each other, we get on each other's nerves."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Maybe you won't now. Maybe Nelson will just have to put up with you and you with him."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Harry humbly tells her, "I'd be willing." Father and son, together against the world, rebuilding the lot up from scratch: the vision excites him, for the moment. Shooting the bull with Benny and Elvira while Nelson skitters around out there in the lake of rooftops, selling used cars like hotcakes. Springer Motors back to what it used to be before Fred got the Toyota franchise. So they owe a few hundred thousand ? the government owes trillions and nobody cares.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She sees hope in his face and touches his cheek a third time. At night now, Harry, having to arise at least once and sometimes, if there's been more than one beer with television, twice, has learned to touch his way across the bedroom in the pitch dark, touching the glass top of the bedside table and then with an outreached arm after a few blind steps the slick varnished edge of the high bureau and from there to the knob of the bathroom door. Each touch, it occurs to him every night, leaves a little deposit of sweat and oil from the skin of his fingertips; eventually it will darken the varnished bureau edge as the hems of his golf?pants pockets have been rendered grimy by his reaching in and out for tees and ball markers, round after round, over the years; and that accumulated deposit of his groping touch, he sometimes thinks when the safety of the bathroom and its luminescent light switch has been attained, will still be there, a shadow on the varnish, a microscopic cloud of his body oils, when he is gone.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Don't push me, honey," Janice says, in a rare tone of direct appeal that makes his hard old heart accelerate with revived husbandly feeling. "This horrible thing with Nelson really has been a stress, though I may not always show it. I'm his mother, I'm humiliated, I don't know what's going to happen, exactly. Everything's in flux."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>His chest feels full; his left ribs cage a twinge. His vision of working side by side with Nelson has fled, a pipe dream. He tries to make Janice, so frighteningly, unusually somber and frontal, smile with a tired joke. "I'm too old for flux," he tells her.</p>
