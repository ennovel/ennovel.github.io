Grainy voices with that rich timbre peculiar to black males ask if Nelson Angstrom is there. Harry or Janice responds that Nelson does not live here, that this is the home of his parents. "Well I ain't had no luck at the number he give me for a home number and at the place he works this here secretary always say the man is out."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Would you like to leave a message?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A pause. "You just tell him Julius called." Or Luther.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>` Julius?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"That's right."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"And what's it about, Julius? You want to say?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"He'll know what it's about. You just tell him Julius called." Or Perry. Or Dave.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Or the caller would hang up without leaving a name. Or would have a thin, faintly foreign, precise way of speaking, and once wanted to speak not to Nelson but with Harry. "I am regretful to bother you, sir, but this son you have leaves me no recourse but to inform you in person."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"To inform me of what?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"To inform you that your son has incurred serious debts and gentlemen to which I am associated, against any advice which I attempt to give them, talk of doing physical harm."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Physical harm to Nelson?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Or even to certain of his near and dear. This is sorry to say and I do apologize, but these are not perhaps such gentlemen. I myself am merely the bearer of bad tidings. Do not rest the blame with me." The voice seemed to be drawing closer to the telephone mouthpiece, closer to Harry's ear, growing plaintively sincere, attempting to strike up a conspiracy, to become Harry's friend and ally. The familiar room, the den with its frost?faced TV and two silvery?pink wing chairs and bookshelves holding a smattering mostly of history books and on the upper shelves some china knickknacks (fairies under toadstools, cherubic bald monks, baby robins in a nest of porcelain straws) that used to be in Ma Springer's breakfront, all this respectable furniture changes quality, becomes murky and fluid and useless, at the insertion of this menacing plaintive voice into his ear, a voice with a heart of sorts, with an understandable human mission, an unpleasant duty to do, calling out of an extensive slippery underground: just so, the balmy blue air above the Gulf of Mexico changed for him, as if a filter had been slipped over his eyes, when the Sunfish tipped over.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Rabbit asks, treading water, "How did Nelson incur these debts?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The voice likes getting his own words back. "He incurred them, sir, in pursuit of his satisfactions, and that is within his privileges, but he or someone on his behalf must pay. My associates have been assured that you are a very excellent father."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Not so hot, actually. Whajou say your name was?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I did not say, se?or. I did not give myself a name. It is the name of Angstrom that is of concern. My associates are eager to settle with anyone of that excellent name." This man, it occurred to Harry, loves the English language, as an instrument full of promise, of unexplored resources.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"My son," Harry tells him, "is an adult and his finances have nothing to do with me."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"That is your word? Your very final word?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"It is. Listen, I live half the year in Florida and come back and -'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But the caller has hung up, leaving Harry with the sensation that the walls of his solid little limestone house are as thin as diet crackers, that the wall?to?wall carpet under his feet is soaked with water, that a pipe has burst and there is no plumber to call.</p>
