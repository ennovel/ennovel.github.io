She is a bit overweight but it's packed on firm. She looks familiar. She has pale?blue eyes in sockets that make a dent above the cheekbones in the three?quarters view, and her upper lip has that kind of puffy look he likes, like Michelle Pfeiffer. Her hair shows under her nurse's cap as browny?red, many?colored, with even a little gray, though she is young enough to be his daughter.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She lifts the strange plastic rocket?shaped thermometer that gives its reading in red segmented numbers from his mouth and enwraps his left arm with the Velcro?fastened blood?pressure cuff. As she inflates it she asks, "How's the Toyota business?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Not bad. The weak dollar doesn't help. My son runs the place now, basically. How'd you know I sold Toyotas?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"My boyfriend then and I bought a car from you about ten years ago." She lifts those bleached blue eyes mockingly. "Don't you remember?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"It's you! Yes. Of course. Of course I remember. An orange Corolla." She is his daughter; or at least he imagines she is, though Ruth out of spite would never admit it to him. As the girl stands close to his bed, he reads her badge: ANNABELLE BYER; R.N. She still has her maiden name.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Annabelle frowns, and deflates the blood?pressure cuff, as tight around his arm as a policeman's grip. "Let's try that again in a minute. It shot up while we were talking."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He asks her, "How'd the Corolla work out? How'd the boyfriend work out, for that matter? What the hell was his name? Big red?eared country kid."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Don't talk, please, until I've got my reading. I'll be quiet. Try to think of something soothing."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He thinks of Ruth's farm, the Byer place, the slope down through the orchard from the line of scrub trees he used to spy behind ? the little square stone house, the yellow shells of the abandoned school buses, the dark collie that tried to herd him down there, as though he knew Harry belonged there with the others. Fritzie, that was that dog's name. Sharp teeth, black gums. Oo boy, scary. Calm down. Think of the big sky of Texas, above the hot low barracks at Fort Larson, himself in fresh khaki, with a pass for the evening. Freedom, a soft breeze, a green sunset on the low horizon. Think of playing basketball against Oriole High, that little country gym, the backboards flush against the walls, before all the high schools merged into big colorless regionals and shopping malls began eating up the farmland. Think of sledding with Mim in her furry hood, in Mt. Judge behind the hat factory, on a winter's day so short the streetlights come on an hour before suppertime calls you home.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"That's better," the nurse says. "One forty over ninety?five. Not great, but not bad. In answer to your questions: the car lasted longer than the boyfriend. I traded in the car after eight years; it had a hundred twenty thousand miles on the speedometer. Jamie moved out about a year after we moved into town. He went back to Galilee. Brewer was too tough for him."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"And you? Is it too tough for you?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"No, I like it. I like the action."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Action like her mother used to get? You were a real hooer? Dusk and May's fully arrived leafiness soften his private room; it is a quiet time on the hospital floor, after dinner and the post?work surge of visitors. Harry dares ask, "You married now? Or live with a guy?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She smiles, her natural kindness contending a moment with surprise at his curiosity, his presumption, and then smoothing her face into calm again. The dusk seems to be gathering it closer, the pale round glimmer of her face. But her voice discloses a city dryness, a guardedness that might rise up. "No, as a matter of fact I live with my mother. She sold the farm we inherited from my father and moved in with me after Jamie moved out."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I think I know that farm. I've passed it on the road." Harry's violated, tired heart feels weighted by so much information, as his groin had been weighted down, literally sandbagged, in the hours after the angioplasty. To think of that other world, with all its bushes and seasons and green days and brown, where this child's life had passed without him. "Does Ruth -" he begins, and ends, "What does she do? Your mother."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The girl gives him a look but then answers readily, as if the question passed some test. "She works for one of these investment companies from out of state, money markets and mutual funds and all that, that have branch offices in the new glass building downtown, across from where Kroll's used to be."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"A stenographer," Rabbit remembers. "She could take dictation and type."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The girl actually laughs, in surprise at his groping command of the truth. She is beginning to be pert, to drop her nurse's manner. She has backed off a step from his bed, and her full thighs press against the crisp front of her white uniform so that even standing up she has a lap. Why is Ruth turning this girl into a spinster? She tells him, "She was hired for that but being so much older than the other women they've let her have some more responsibility. She's a kind of junior exec now. Did you know my mother, ever?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I'm not sure," he lies.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You must have, in the days when she was single. She told me she knew quite a few guys before meeting up with my father." She smiles, giving him permission to have known her mother.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I guess she did," Harry says, sad at the thought. Always he has wanted to be every woman's only man, as he was his mother's only son. "I met her once or twice."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You should see her," Annabelle goes on pertly. "She's lost a lot of weight and dresses real snappy. I kid her, she has more boyfriends than I do."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Rabbit closes his eyes and tries to picture it, at their age. Come on. Work. Dressing snappy. Once a city girl, always a city girl. Her hair, that first time he saw her, rimmed with red neon like wilt.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The girl he thinks is his daughter goes on, "I'll tell her you're in here, Mr. Angstrom." Though he is trying now to withdraw, into his evening stupor, an awakening affinity between them has stirred her to a certain forwardness. "Maybe she'll remember more than you do."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Outside the sealed hospital windows, in the slowly thickening dusk, sap is rising, and the air even in here feels languid with pollen. Involuntarily Harry's eyes close again. "No," he says, "that's O.K. Don't tell her anything. I doubt if she'd remember anything." He is suddenly tired, too tired for Ruth. Even if this girl is his daughter, it's an old story, going on and on, like a radio nobody's listening to.</p>
