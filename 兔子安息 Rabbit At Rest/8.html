In the thirty years since, he has often driven this way, to Brewer's northwestern edge and beyond, where the highway with its motels (Economy Lodge, Coronet, Safe Haven) melts into farmland and signs pointing the way to Harrisburg and Pittsburgh begin to appear. One by one the farms and their stone buildings, the bank bams put together with pegs and beams and the farmhouses built square to the compass with walls two feet thick, are going under to real?estate developments. Two miles beyond the pike to Maiden Springs, where the Murketts used to live before they got divorced, there is a fairly new development called Arrowdale after the old Arrowhead Farm that was sold off by the nieces and nephews of the old spinster who lived there so many years and had wanted to leave it to some television evangelist as a kind of salvation park, a holy?roller retreat, but whose lawyers kept talking her out of it. Rabbit as these recent years have gone by has watched the bulldozed land lose its raw look and the trees and bushes grow up so it almost seems houses have always been here. The streets curve, as they did in the Murketts' development, but the houses are more ordinary – ranch houses and split levels with sides of aluminum clapboards and fronts of brick varied by flagstone porchlets and unfunctional patches of masonry facing. Cement walks traverse small front yards with azaleas not quite in bloom beneath the picture windows. Bark mulch abounds, and matching porch furniture, and a tyrannical neatness absent in the older more blue?collar towns like Mt. Judge and West Brewer.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Ronnie and Thelma Harrison moved to one of these modest new houses when their three boys grew up and went off. Alex, the oldest, is an electronics engineer somewhere south of San Francisco; the middle boy, Georgie, who had had reading problems in school, is trying to be a dancer and musician in New York City; and their youngest, Ron junior, has stayed in the county, as a part?time construction worker, though he put in two years of college at Lehigh. Thelma doesn't complain about her sons or her house, though to Harry they seem disappointing, disappointingly ordinary, for a woman of Thelma's intelligence and, in his experience of her, passion.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Thelma's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, has cost a fortune over the years, even with the benefits from Ronnie's insurance company's health plan. And it has meant that she has not been able to go back to teaching elementary school when her boys were gone, as she had hoped. Her health has been too erratic; it has kept her at home, where Harry could usually find her. This noon when he called from a pay phone in Brewer he expected her to answer and she did. He asked ifhe might drive over and she said he might. She didn't sound happy to hear from him, but not distressed either: resigned, merely. He leaves the Celica out front at the curving curb, though usually over the years she opened the garage for him and closed the door electronically from within the kitchen, to hide the evidence. But now that he is as sick as if not sicker than she, he doesn't know how much they still have to conceal. The neighborhood is empty during the midday, until the buses bring the children home from school. A single whining engine is at work somewhere out of sight in Arrowdale, and the air holds a pervasive vibration and hum of traffic from the Maiden Springs Pike. Also out of sight, some birds are chirping, raucous in their nesting frenzy, though the development is skimpy on trees. A robin hops on the bit of lawn beside Thelma's cement walk, and thrashes into the air as Harry approaches. He doesn't remember robins as seeming such big fierce birds; this one looked the size of a crow. He climbs two flagstone steps and crosses a little porch; Thelma opens the front door before he can ring the bell.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She seems smaller, and her hair grayer. Her prim, rather plain face always had a sallow tinge, and this jaundice has deepened, he can observe through the makeup she uses to soften her butterfly rash, a reddening the disease has placed like a soreness across her nose and beneath her eyes. Nevertheless, her deeply known presence stirs him. They lightly kiss, when she has closed the door, a long light?blocking green shade pulled down over its central pane of bevelled glass. Her lips are cool, and faintly greasy. She stays a time within his embrace, as if expecting something more to happen, her body relaxed against his in unspeakable confession.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You're thin," she says, drawing at last away.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"A little less fat," he tells her. "I've a long way to go before I satisfy the doctors and Janice." It seems only natural to mention Janice, though he had to make his tongue do it. Thelma knows the score, and did from the start. The whole affair was her idea, though he grew used to it over the years, and built it in. Her walk as she moves away from him into the living room seems stiff, a bit of a waddle; arthritis is part of the lupus.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Janice," she repeats. "How is Wonder Woman?" Once he confided that he called Janice that and Thelma has never forgotten. Women don't forget, especially what you wish they would.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Oh, no different. She keeps busy in Florida with all these different groups, she's kind of the baby of our condo, and a shiksa besides. You'd hardly know her, she's so on the ball. Her tennis is terrific, the people who play tell me." He is getting too enthusiastic, he realizes. "But we were happy to leave. It got cold. March was miserable. At least up here you expect it and have the clothes."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You never told us about your heart attack." That "us" is a little payback for his mentioning Janice right off: You trail your spouses after you like shadows, right into bed; they becloud the sheets.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"It didn't seem worth bragging about."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"We heard about it from little Ron, who knows a boy who knows Nelson. The kiddie network. Imagine how I felt, learning about it that way. My lover nearly dies and never tells me."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"How would we, I, whoever, tell you? It's not the kind of thing they have cards for in the drugstore."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In recent years he and Janice have seen less and less of the Harrisons. Rabbit and Ron were Mt. Judge boys together and played on the high?school basketball varsities that, coached by Marty Tothero, were league champions for two out of their three years in senior high. But he has never liked Ronnie: loudmouthed, pushy, physically crude, always playing with himself in the locker room, flicking towels, giving redbellies, terrorizing the JVs. Women don't mind this kind of prick as much as Harry does. Part of Thelma's fascination for him has been that she could stand the guy, put up with his sexual tricks and remain outwardly such a prim, plain schoolteacher?type. Not really plain: with her clothes off her body is somehow better than her clothes have led you to expect. The first time they ever slept together, her breasts seemed like a girl's in Playboy ? nipples like perfect little doorbells.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"What can I offer you?" Thelma asks. "Coffee. A beer?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Both are no?nos for the new me. Do you have anything like a Diet Coke or Pepsi?" He remembers Judy's little quavering voice singing Coke is it on that long zigzag ride into shore.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Sure. We don't drink much any more ourselves, now that we've resigned from the Flying Eagle."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You ever coming back?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I don't think so. We heard the fees went up again, as you maybe didn't notice, you're so rich, plus the assessment for repairs to the two greens close to the road that are always being vandalized. Even three years ago Ronnie figured it was costing him over eighty dollars a round, it wasn't worth it. There's a whole new younger crowd out at the Eagle now that dominates everything. They've changed the tone. It's gotten too yuppie."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Too bad. I miss playing with old Ronnie."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Why? You can't stand him, Harry."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I like beating him."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Thelma nods, as if acknowledging her own contribution to Harry's beating Ronnie. But she can't help it, she loves this man, his soft pale bemusement and cool hard heart, his uncircumcised prick, his offhand style, and in her slow dying has not denied herself the pleasure of expressing this love, as much as Harry has been able to bear it. She has kept her strongest feelings contained, and the affair has enriched her transactions with God, giving her something to feel sinful about, to discuss with Him. It seems to explain her lupus, if she's an adulteress. It makes it easier on Him, if she deserves to be punished.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She goes into the kitchen for the soft drinks. Rabbit roams quietly in the living room; in preparation for his visit she has pulled not only the narrow shade on the front door but the wide one on the picture window. He pities the room ? its darkness as if even weak windowlight would penetrate her skin and accelerate the destruction of her cells, its hushed funereal fussiness. Wild though she can be, with a streak of defiance as though daring to be damned, Thelma maintains a conventional local decor. Stuffed flowered chairs with broad wooden arms, plush chocolate?brown sofa with needlepointed scatter pillows and yellowing lace antimacassars, varnished little knickknack stands and taborets, a footstool on which an old watermill is depicted, symmetrical lamps whose porcelain bases show English hunting dogs in gilded ovals, an oppressively patterned muddy neo?Colonial wallpaper, and on every flat surface, fringed runners and semi?precious glass and porcelain elves and parrots and framed photographs of babies and graduating sons and small plates and kettles of hammered copper and pewter, objects to dust around but never to rearrange. This front room, but for the television set hulking in its walnut cabinet with its powdery gray?green face wearing a toupee of doilies and doodads, could have come out of Harry's adolescence, when he was gingerly paying calls on girls whose mothers came forward from the kitchen, drying their hands on their aprons, to greet him in motionless stuffed rooms such as this. The houses he has kept with Janice have had in comparison a dishevelled, gappy quality that has nevertheless given him room to breathe. This room is so finished, he feels in it he should be dead. It smells of all the insurance policies Ron sold to buy its furnishings.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"So tell me about it," Thelma says, returning with a round painted tray holding along with the two tall glasses of sparkling dark soft drink two matching small bowls of nuts. She sets the tray down on a glass?topped coffee table like an empty long picture frame.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He tells her, "For one thing, I'm not supposed to have stuff like that ? salted nuts. Macadamia nuts yet! The worst thing for me, and they cost a fortune. Thel, you're wicked."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He has embarrassed her; her jaundiced skin tries to blush. Her basically thin face today looks swollen, perhaps from the cortisone she takes. "Ronnie buys them. They just happened to be around. Don't eat them if you can't, Harry. I didn't know. I don't know how to act with you, it's been so long."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"A couple won't kill me," he reassures her, and to be polite takes a few macadamia nuts into his fingers. Nuggets, they are like small lightweight nuggets with a fur of salt. He especially loves the way, when he holds one in his mouth a few seconds and then gently works it between his crowned molars, it breaks into two halves, the surface of the fissure as smooth to the tongue as glass, as baby skin. "And cashews, too," he says. "The second?worst thing for me. Dry?roasted yet."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I seem to remember you like dry?roasted."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"There's a lot I bet you seem to remember," he says, taking a tasteless sip of his Diet Coke. First they take the cocaine out, then the caffeine, and now the sugar. He settles back with a small hand-ful of cashews; dry?roasted, they have a little acid sting to them, the tang of poison that he likes. He has taken the rocking chair, painted black with stencilled red designs and a red?and?yellow flat pillow tied in place, to sit in, and she the plush brown sofa, not sinking into it but perching on the edge, her knees together and touching the raised edge of the coffee table. They have made love on that sofa, which was not long enough to stretch out on but long enough if both parties kept their knees bent. In a way he preferred it to one of the beds, since she seemed to feel guiltier and less free with herself in a real bed, a bed her family used, and her unease would spread to him. Moving the table, he could kneel beside the sofa and have the perfect angle for kissing her cunt. On and on, deeper into her darkness where things began to shudder and respond, it got to be an end in itself. He loved it when she would clamp his face between her damp thighs like a nut in a nutcracker and come. He wondered if a man ever got his neck broken that way.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A shadow has crossed Thelma's face, a flinching as if he has consigned her to merely remembering, to the sealed and unre-peatable past like the photographs on the silent television set. But he had meant it more comfortably, settling in his rocker opposite the one person who for these last ten years has given him nothing but what he needed. Sex. Soul food.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You too," she says, her eyes lowered to the items on the tray, which she hasn't touched, "have things to remember, I hope."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I just was. Remembering. You seem sad," he says, accusing, for his presence should make her glad, in spite of all.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You don't seem quite you yet. You seem ? more careful."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Jesus, you'd be too. I'll have some more macadamia nuts, if that'll please you." He eats them one by one and between bouts of chewing and feeling their furry nuggets part so smoothly in his mouth tells her about his heart attack ? the boat, the Gulf, little Judy, the lying on the beach feeling like a jellyfish, the hospital, the doctors, their advice, his attempts to follow it. "They're dying to cut into me and do a bypass. But there's this less radical option they can do first and I'm supposed to see a guy up here at St. Joseph's about having it done this spring. It's called an angio-plasty. There's a balloon on the end of a catheter a yard long at least they thread up into your heart from a cut they make just under your groin, the artery there. I had it done kind of in Florida but instead of a balloon it was a bunch of dyes they put in to see what my poor old ticker actually looked like. It's a funny experi-ence: it doesn't exactly hurt but you feel very funny, demoralized like, while it's being done and terrible for days afterward. When they put the dye in, your chest goes hot like you're in an oven. Deep, it feels too deep. Like having a baby but then no baby, just a lot of computerized bad news about your coronary arteries. Still, it beats open?heart, where they saw through your sternum for starters" ? he touches the center of his chest and thinks of Thelma's breasts, their nipples so perfect to suck, waiting behind her blouse, waiting for him to make his move ? "and then run all your blood through a machine for hours. I mean, that machine is you, for the time being. It stops, you die. A guy I play golf with down there had a quadruple and a valve replacement and a pacemaker while they were at it and he says he's never been the same, it was like a truck ran over him and then backed up. His swing, too, is terrible; he's never got it back. But enough, huh? What about you? How's your health?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"How do I look?" She sips the Coke but leaves all the nuts in their twin bowls for him. The pattern imitates sampler stitch, squarish flowers in blue and pink.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Good to me," he lies. "A little pale and puffy but we all do at the end of winter."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I'm losing it, Harry," Thelma tells him, looking up until he meets her eyes. Eyes muddier than Pru's but also what they call hazel, eyes that have seen him all over, that know him as well as a woman's can. A wife fumbles around with you in the dark; a mistress you meet in broad daylight, right on the sofa. She used to tease him about his prick wearing a bonnet, with the foreskin still on. "My kidneys are worse and the steroid dose can't go any higher. I'm so anemic I can hardly drag around the house to do the work and have to take naps every afternoon ? you're right in the middle of my nap time, as a matter of fact." He makes an instinctive motion, tightening his hands on the chair arms to pull himself up, and her voice lifts toward anger. "No. Don't go. Don't you dare. For God's sake. I don't see you at all for nearly six months and then you're up here a week before you bother to call."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Thelma, she's around, I can't just wander off. I was getting reacclimated. I have to take it more easy on myself now."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You've never loved me, Harry. You just loved the fact that I loved you. I'm not complaining. It's what I deserve. You make your own punishments in life, I honest to God believe that. You get exactly what you deserve. God sees to it. Look at my hands. I used to have pretty hands. At least I thought they were pretty. Now half the fingers ? look at them! Deformed. I couldn't even get my wedding ring off if I tried now."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He looks, leaning forward so the rocker tips under him, to examine her extended hands. The knuckles are swollen and shiny, and some of the segments with the fingernails go off at a slight angle, but he wouldn't have noticed without her calling his attention to it. "You don't want to get your wedding ring off" he tells her. "As I remember, you and Ronnie are stuck together with glue. You even eat the glue sometimes, I seem to remember your telling me."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Her hands have made Thelma angry and he is fighting back, as if she blames her hands on him. She says, "You always minded that, that I was a wife to Ronnie, along with serving you whenever it suited. But who were you to mind that, stuck fast to Janice and her money? I never tried to take you away from her, though it would have been easy at times."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Would it?" He rocks back. "I don't know, something about that little mutt still gets to me. She won't give up. She never really figured out how the world is put together but she's still working at it. Now she's got the idea she wants to be a working girl. She's signed up at the Penn State annex over on Pine Street for those courses you have to take to get a real?estate broker's license. At Mt. Judge High I don't think she ever got over a C, even in home ec. Come to think of it, I bet she flunked home ec., the only girl in the history of the school."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Thelma grudgingly smiles; her sallow face lights up in her shadowy living room. "Good for her," she says. "If I had my health, I'd be getting out myself. This being a homemaker ? they sold us a bill of goods, back there in home ec."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"How is Ronnie, by the way?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"The same," she says, with a note of that languid, plaintive music the women of the county inject into their saga of their stoic days. "Not hustling so hard for the new customers now, coasting along on the old. He's out from under the children's educations, so his only financial burden is me and the doctor bills. Not that he wouldn't be willing to pay for little Ron to finish up at Lehigh if he wanted; it's been a disappointment, his becoming a kind of hippie the way he has. The funny thing was he was the cleverest of the three at school. Things just came too easy to him, I guess."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Harry has heard this before. Thelma's voice is dutiful and deliberately calm, issuing small family talk when both know that what she wants to discuss is her old issue, that flared up a minute ago, ofwhether he loves her or not, or why at least he doesn't need her as much as she does him. But their relationship at the very start, the Caribbean night they first slept together, was established with her in pursuit of him, and all the years since, of hidden meetings, of wise decisions to end it and thrilling abject collapses back into sex, have not disrupted the fundamental pattern of her giving and his taking, of her fearing their end more than he, and clinging, and disliking herself for clinging, and wanting to punish him for her dislike, and him shrugging and continuing to bask in the sun of her love, that rises every day whether he is there or not. He can't believe it, quite, and has to keep testing her.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"These kids," he says, taking a bluff tone as if they are making small talk in public instead of enjoying this stolen intimacy behind drawn shades in Arrowdale, "they break your heart. You ought to see Nelson when he's down there in Florida and has to live with me a little. The poor kid was jumping out of his skin."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Thelma makes an annoyed motion with her hands. "Harry, you're not actually God, it just feels that way to you. Do you real-ly think Nelson was jumpy because of you?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Why else?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She knows something. She hesitates, but cannot resist, perhaps, a bit of revenge for his taking her always for granted, for his being in Pennsylvania a week before calling. "You must know about Nelson. My boys say he's a cocaine addict. They've all used it, that generation, but Nelson they tell me is really hooked. As they say, the drug runs him, instead of him just using the drug."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Harry has rocked back as far as the rocker will take him with-out his shoes leaving the rug and remains in that position so long that Thelma becomes anxious, knowing that this man isn't sound inside and can have a heart attack. At last he rocks forward again and, gazing at her thoughtfully, says, "That explains a lot." He fishes in the side pocket of his tweedy gray sports coat for a small brown bottle and deftly spills a single tiny pill into his hand and puts it in his mouth, under his tongue. There is a certain habitu-ated daintiness in the gesture. "Coke takes money, doesn't it?" he asks Thelma. "I mean, you can go through hundreds. Thousands."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She regrets her telling him, now that the satisfaction is past of shocking him, of waking him up to her existence once again. She is still at heart too much a schoolteacher; she enjoys administering a lesson. "I can't believe Janice doesn't know and hasn't discussed it with you, or that Nelson's wife hasn't come to you both."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Pru's pretty close?mouthed," he says. "I don't see them that much. Even when we're all in the county, it's on opposite sides of Brewer. Janice is over there at her mother's old place a fair amount, but not me. She owns it, I don't."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Harry, don't look so stunned. It's all just rumor, and really is his business, his and his family's. We all do things our parents wouldn't approve of, and they know it, and don't want to know, if you follow me. Oh, Harry, damn it! Now I've made you sad, when I'm dying to make you happy. Why don't you like me to make you happy? Why have you always fought it?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I haven't. I haven't fought it, Thel. We've had great times. It's just, we've never been exactly set up for a lot of happiness, and now -"</p> 
<p>"Now, dear?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Now I know how you've been feeling all these years."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She wants for him to explain, but he can't he is suddenly aficted by tact. She prompts, "Mortal?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Yeah. Close to it. I mean, things wearing thin so you sort of look right through them."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Including me."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Not you. Cut it out, making me jump through this same fucking hoop all the time. Why do you think I'm here?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"To make love. To screw me. Go ahead. I mean come ahead. Why do you think I answered the door?" She has leaned forward across the table, her knees white where they press against the edge, and her face has taken on that melting crazy look women get at the decision to go with it, to fuck in spite of all, which frightens him now because it suggests a willing slide down into death.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Wait. Thel. Let's think about this." On cue, the nitroglycerin has worked its way through and he gets that tingle. He sits back, suppressing it. "I'm supposed to avoid excitement."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She asks, amused somehow by the need to negotiate, "Have you made love with Janice?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Once or twice maybe. I kind of forget. You know, it's like brushing your teeth at night, you forget if you did or didn't."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She takes this in, and decides to tease him. "I made up Alex's old bed for us."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You didn't use to like to use real beds."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I've become very liberated," she says, smiling, extracting what pleasure she can out of his evasions.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He is tempted, picturing Thelma in bed naked, her tallowy willing body, her breasts that have nursed three boy babies and two men at least but look virginal and rosy like a baby's thumbtips, not bumply and chewed and dark like Janice's, her buttocks glassy in texture and not finely gritty like Janice's, her pubic hair reddish and skimpy enough to see the slit through unlike Janice's opaque thick bush, and her shameless and matter?of?fact mouth, Thelma's, her frank humorous hunger, amused at being caught in the trap of lust over and over, not holding it against him all these years of off and on, in and out. But then he thinks of Ronnie who knows where that obnoxious prick's prick has been, Rabbit can't believe he's as faithful as Thelma thinks he is, not from the way he used to carry on in the locker room, not from the way he was screwing Ruth before Harry was, and cashing in Cindy that time in the Caribbean ? and of AIDS. That virus too small to imagine travelling through our fluids, even a drop or two of saliva or cunt slime, and unlocking our antibodies with its little picks, so that our insides lose their balance and we topple into pneumonia, into starvation. Love and death, they can't be pried apart any more. But he can't tell Thelma that. It would be spitting in her wide?open face.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On her own she sees he isn't up to it. She asks, "Another Coke?" He has drunk it all, he sees, and consumed without thinking both the little bowls of fatty, sodium?soaked nuts.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"No. I ought to run. But let me sit here a little longer. Being with you is such a relief."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Why? It seems I make claims, like all the others."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A little lightning of pain flickers across his chest, narrowing his scope of breath. Claims lie heavy around him, squeezing. Now a sexually unsatisfied mistress, another burden. But he lies, "No you don't. You've been all gravy, Thel. I know it's cost you, but you've been terrific."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Harry, please. Don't sound so maudlin. You're still young. What? Fifty?five? Not even above the speed limit."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Fifty?six two months ago. That's not old for some guys ? not for a stocky little plug?ugly like Ronnie, he'll go forever. But if you're the height I am and been overweight as long, the heart gets tired of lugging it all around." He has developed, he realizes, an image of his heart as an unwilling captive inside his chest, a galley slave or one of those blinded horses that turn a mill wheel. He feels that Thelma is looking at him in a new way ? clinically, with a detached appraising look far distant from the melting crazy look. He has forfeited something by not fucking her: he has lost full rank, and she is moving him out, without even knowing it. Fair enough. With her lupus, he moved her out a long while ago. If Thelma had been healthy, why wouldn't he have left Janice for her in this last decade? Instead he used all the holes she had and then hustled back into whatever model Toyota he was driving that year and back to Janice in her stubborn, stupid health. What was there about Janice? It must be religious, their tie, it made so little other sense.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Two ailing old friends, he and Thelma sit for half an hour, talking symptoms and children, catching up on the fate of common acquaintances ? Peggy Fosnacht dead, Ollie down in New Orleans she heard, Cindy Murkett fat and unhappy working in a boutique in the new mall out near Oriole, Webb married for the fourth time to a woman in her twenties and moved from that fancy modern house in Brewer Heights with all his home carpentry to an old stone farmhouse in the south of the county, near Galilee, that he has totally renovated.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"That Webb. Anything he wants to do, he does. He really knows how to live."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Not really. I was never as impressed with him as you and Janice were. I always thought he was a smartass know?it?all."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You think Janice was impressed?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Thelma is slightly flustered, and avoids his eye. "Well, there was that one night at least. She didn't complain, did she?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Neither did I," he says gallantly, though what he chiefly remembers is how tired he was the next morning, and how weird golf seemed, with impossible jungle and deep coral caves just off the fairway. Janice got Webb, and Ronnie sweet Cindy. Thelma told Harry that night she had loved him for years.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She nods in sarcastic acknowledgment of the compliment, and says, returning to an earlier point in their conversation, "About being mortal ? I suppose it affects different people different ways, but for me there's never been a thinning out. Being alive, no matter how sick I feel, feels absolute. You're absolutely alive and when you're not you'll be absolutely something else. Do you and Janice ever go to church?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Not too surprised, since Thelma has always been religious in her way, it goes with her conventional decor and secretive sexiness, he answers, "Rarely, actually. The churches down there have this folksy Southern thing. And most of our friends happen to be Jewish."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Ronnie and I go every Sunday now. One of these new denominations that goes back to fundamentals. You know ? we're lost, and we're saved."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Oh yeah?" These marginal sects depress Harry. At least the moldy old denominations have some history to them.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I believe it, sometimes," she says. "It helps the panic, when you think of all the things you'll never do that you always thought vaguely you might. Like go to Portugal, or get a master's degree."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Well, you did some things. You did Ronnie, and me, me up brown I'd say, and you did raise three sons. You might get to Portugal yet. They say it's cheap, relatively. The only country over there I've ever wanted to go to is Tibet. I can't believe I won't make it. Or never be a test pilot, like I wanted to when I was ten. As you say, I still think I'm God."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I didn't mean that unkindly. It's charming, Harry."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Except maybe to Nelson."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Even to him. He wouldn't want you any different."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Here's a question for you, Thel. You're smart. What ever happened to the Dalai Lama?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In her clinical appraising mood, nothing should surprise her, but Thelma laughs. "He's still around, isn't he? In fact, hasn't he been in the news a little, now that the Tibetans are rioting again? Why, Harry? Have you become a devotee of his? Is that why you don't go to church?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He stands, not liking being teased about this. "I've always kind of identified with him. He's about my age, I like to keep track of the guy. I have a gut feeling this'll be his year." As he stands there, the rocking chair on the rebound taps his calves and his medications make him feel lightheaded. "Thanks for the nuts," he says. "There's a lot we could still say."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She stands too, stiffly fighting the plushy grip of the sofa, and with her arthritic waddle steps around the table, and places her body next to his, her face at his lapel. She looks up at him with that presumptuous solemnity of women you have fucked. She urges him, "Believe in God, darling. It helps."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He squirms, inside. "I don't not believe."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"That's not quite enough, I fear. Harry, darling." She likes the sound of "darling." "Before you go, let me see him at least."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"See who?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Him, Harry. You. With his bonnet."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Thelma kneels, there in her frilled and stagnant dim living room, and unzips his fly. He feels the clinical cool touch of her fingers and sees the gray hairs on the top of her head, radiating from her parting; his heart races in expectation of her warm mouth as in the old days.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But she just says, "Just lovely," and tucks it back, half hard, into his jockey shorts, and rezips his fly and struggles to her feet. She is a bit breathless, as if from a task of housework. He embraces her and this time it is he who clings.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"The reason I haven't left Janice and never can now," he confesses, suddenly near tears, maudlin as she said, "is, without her, I'm shit. I'm unemployable. I'm too old. All I can be from here on in is her husband."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He expects sympathy, but perhaps his mention of Janice is one too many. Thelma goes dead, somehow, in his arms. "I don't know," she says.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"About what?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"About your coming here again."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Oh let me," he begs, perversely feeling at last in tune with this encounter and excited by her. "Without you, I don't have a life."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Maybe Nature is trying to tell us something. We're too old to keep being foolish."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Never, Thelma. Not you and me."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You don't seem to want me."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I want you, I just don't want Ronnie's little bugs."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She pushes at his chest to free herself. "There's nothing wrong with Ronnie. He's as safe and clean as I am."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Yeah, well, that goes without saying, the way you two carry on. That's what I'm afraid of. I tell you, Thelma, you don't know him. He's a madman. You can't see it, because you're his loyal wife."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Harry, I think we've reached a point where the more we say, the worse it'll get. Sex isn't what it used to be, you're right about that. We must all be more careful. You be careful. Keep brushing your teeth, and I'll brush mine."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It isn't until he is out on Thelma's curved walk, the door with its pulled curtain and bevelled glass shut behind him, that he catches her allusion to toothbrushing. Another slam at him and Janice. You can't say anything honest to women, they have minds like the FBI. The robin is still there, on the little lawn. Maybe it's sick, all these animals around us have their diseases too, their histories of plague. It gives Rabbit a beady eye and hops a bit away in Thelma's waxy April grass but disdains to take wing. Robin, hop. The bold yellow of dandelions has come this week to join that of daffodils and forsythia. Telltale. Flowers attracting bees as we attract each other. Our signals. Smells. If only he were back in her house he'd fuck her despite all the danger. Instead he finds safety inside his gray Celica; as he glides away the stillness of Arrowdale is broken by the return of the lumbering yellow school buses, and their release, at every corner of the curved streets, of shrilly yelling children.</p>
