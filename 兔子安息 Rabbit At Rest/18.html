He takes a moment to recognize her voice, it is so dry and twangy, so whisky?and?cigarette?cracked. "What are they doing to you now?" she asks. She has always taken the attitude that he is a lamb among wolves in Diamond County and he should have gotten out like she did.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"They've got me in the hospital," he tells her. He could almost cry, like a boy. "They stuck a balloon up through my leg into my heart and pumped it full of saltwater to open up an artery that was plugged up with old grease I've been eating. Then afterwards they put a sandbag on the incision down at my thigh and told me not to move my leg for six hours or I'd bleed to death. That's how hospitals are; they tell you what they're going to do is about as simple as having a haircut and then midway through they tell you you might bleed to death. And then this morning the doctor comes around and tells me it was a Mickey Mouse operation and hardly worth bothering with. He wants me to go for broke and have a multiple bypass. Mim, they split you right open like a coconut and rip veins out of your legs."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Yeah, I know," she says. "You gonna do it?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Rabbit says, "I suppose they'll talk me into it eventually. I mean, they've got you by the balls. You're scared, and what else is there?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Guys I know out here have had open?heart and swear by it. I can't see it made that much difference, they still spend all day sitting on their fat asses getting manicures and talking on the phone, but then they weren't such dynamite before either. When you get to our age, Harry, it's work to stay alive."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Come on, Mim. You're only fifty."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"For a woman out here, that's ancient. That's cow pasture. That's hang?it?up time, if you're a woman. You don't get the stares any more, it's like you've gone invisible."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Boy, you did use to get the stares," he says proudly. He remembers her when she was nineteen ? dyed?in blonde streak, big red cinch?in belt, sexy soft sweaters, skinny arms ending in a clash of bangle bracelets, buck teeth she couldn't help revealing when she smiled, lips smeared with lipstick like she had eaten a jam sandwich, a leggy colt of a girl dying to break out of Brewer, to kick or fuck her way through the fence. She made it, too. Rabbit never could have made it out there. He was too soft. Even Florida bakes the spirit out of him. He needed to stay where they remembered him when. "So when are you coming east?" he asks Mim.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Well, how bad are you, Harry?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Not that bad. I just complain a lot. All I have to do is stay away from animal fats and salt and don't get aggravated."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Who would aggravate you?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"The usual," he says. "Nellie's been having some problems. Hey, you'll never guess who's back on the scene squiring Janice around while I'm laid up. Your old boyfriend, Charlie Stavros."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Chas was not what I'd ever call a boyfriend. I took him on that time to get him off your wife's back. Around here you're not a boyfriend until you at least set the girl up in a condo."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He is striving to keep her interested. People who've made it like she has, they get bored easily. "How the hell is Vegas?" he asks. "Is it hot there yet? How about you coming east to get away from the heat for a couple of weeks? We'll put you up in the guest room above the den and you'll get to know your great?niece and ?nephew. Judy's a real little lady now. She's gonna be a looker not like you, but a looker."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Harry, the last time I came to Pennsylvania I nearly died from the humidity. I don't know how you people do it, day after day; it was like being wrapped in warm washcloths. It's that heavy climate is doing you in. That pollen is off the scale."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Yeah," he weakly agrees. The phone receiver feels soggy in his hand. His own capacity to be interested isn't what it should be. He's free to wander the halls now, and you see amazing things: less than an hour ago, an amazing visitor, a young Brewer girl, she couldn't have been more than fifteen, all in black, black jacket, tight black pants, pointed black boots, and her hair dyed yellowy white and cut short and mussed every which way so her skull reminded him of a wet Easter chick, plus a little flowery cruciform tattoo pricked right beside her eye. But his heart couldn't quite rise to it, he felt he'd seen even this before, girls doing wicked things to themselves believing their youth would shine through and all would heal.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Maybe l'll come in the fall if you can last it out," Mim tells him.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Oh I can last," he says. "You aren't going to get rid of big brother so easy." But the connection feels strained, and he can sense Mim groping, in the little pauses, for what to say next. "Hey, Mim," he says. "Do you remember if Pop complained of chest pains?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"He had emphysema, Harry. Because he wouldn't stop smoking. You stopped. You were smart. Me, I'm down to a pack a day. But I don't think I ever really inhaled."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I seem to remember him complaining of feeling full in the chest. He'd sneak his hand inside his shirt and rub his chest."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Maybe he itched. Harry, Pop died because he couldn't breathe. Mom died because of her Parkinson's. I suppose their hearts failed in the end but so does everybody's, because that's what life is, a strain on the heart."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>His little sister has become so dogmatic, everything cut and dried. She's mad at something, too. Just like little Roy. "Hey," he says, not wanting to let go however, "and another thing I was wondering about. Remember how you used to always sing, `Shoo?fly pie and apple pan dowdy?"'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Yeah. Kind of."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"What's the line that comes after `Makes your eyes light up, your tummy say "howdy" '?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In the silence he can hear chatter in the background, beautyparlor chatter, and a hair dryer whirring. "I have no fucking idea," she says finally. "Are you sure I used to sing this song?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Well, I was, but never mind. How's your life?" he asks. "Any new irons in the fire? When're we going to marry you off?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Harry, come off it. The only reason anybody out here'd marry an old bag like me would be as some kind of cover. Or a tax dodge, if the accountant could figure one."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Speaking of accountants," he begins, and he might have told her all about Nelson and Lyle and Janice, and the voices on the phone, but she doesn't want to hear him; she says hurriedly, in a lowered voice, "Harry, a real special customer has just come in, even you've heard of her, and I got to hang up. You take care of yourself, now. You sound on the mend. Any time they get to be too much for you, you can come on out here for some sun and fun."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>What sort of fun, he would have liked to ask ? in the old days she was always offering to get a girl for him if he came out alone, though he never did ? and he would have liked to have heard more of why she thinks he is on the mend. But Mim has hung up. She has a life to get on with. His arm hurts in its crook from holding the phone. Ever since they invaded his arteries with dyes and balloons, he has aches and pains in remote and random joints, as if his blood is no longer purely his own. Once you break the cap on a ginger?ale bottle, there is never again as much fizz.</p>
