Her hair is a fanatical blond mop, a particular tawnyhue that used to be called dirty blond. If she were a petite woman, the hair would be too cute, too mischievous andcontrived. Size gives her tousled aspect a certain seriousness. Ample women do not plan such things. They lack theguile for conspiracies of the body.</p> 
<p>　　"You should have been there," I said to her.</p> 
<p>　　"Where?""It's the day of the station wagons.""Did I miss it again? You're supposed to remind me.""They stretched all the way down past the music library and onto the interstate. Blue, green, burgundy, brown. Theygleamed in the sun like a desert caravan.""You know I need reminding, Jack."Babette, disheveled, has the careless dignity of someone too preoccupied with serious matters to know or care whatshe looks like. Not that she is a gift-bearer of great things as the world generally reckons them. She gathers and tendsthe children, teaches a course in an adult education program, belongs to a group of volunteers who read to the blind.</p> 
<p>　　Once a week she reads to an elderly man named Treadwell who lives on the edge of town. He is known as Old ManTreadwell, as if he were a landmark, a rock formation or brooding swamp. She reads to him from the NationalEnquirer, the National Examiner, the National Express, the Globe, the World, the Star. The old fellow demands hisweekly dose of cult mysteries. Why deny him? The point is that Babette, whatever she is doing, makes me feelsweetly rewarded, bound up with a full-souled woman, a lover of daylight and dense life, the miscellaneousswarming air of families. I watch her all the time doing things in measured sequence, skillfully, with seeming ease,unlike my former wives, who had a tendency to feel estranged from the objective world—a self-absorbed andhigh-strung bunch, with ties to the intelligence community.</p> 
<p>　　"It's not the station wagons I wanted to see. What are the people like? Do the women wear plaid skirts, cable-knitsweaters? Are the men in hacking jackets? What's a hacking jacket?""They've grown comfortable with their money," I said. "They genuinely believe they're entitled to it. This convictiongives them a kind of rude health. They glow a little.""I have trouble imagining death at that income level," she said.</p> 
<p>　　"Maybe there is no death as we know it. Just documents changing hands.""Not that we don't have a station wagon ourselves.""It's small, it's metallic gray, it has one whole rusted door.""Where is Wilder?" she said, routinely panic-stricken, calling out to the child, one of hers, sitting motionless on histricycle in the backyard.</p> 
<p>　　Babette and I do our talking in the kitchen. The kitchen and the bedroom are the major chambers around here, thepower haunts, the sources. She and I are alike in this, that we regard the rest of the house as storage space forfurniture, toys, all the unused objects of earlier marriages and different sets of children, the gifts of lost in-laws, thehand-me-downs and rummages. Things, boxes. Why do these possessions carry such sorrowful weight? There is adarkness attached to them, a foreboding. They make me wary not of personal failure and defeat but of somethingmore general, something large in scope and content.</p> 
<p>　　She came in with Wilder and seated him on the kitchen counter. Denise and Steffie came downstairs and we talkedabout the school supplies they would need. Soon it was time for lunch. We entered a period of chaos and noise. Wemilled about, bickered a little, dropped utensils. Finally we were all satisfied with what we'd been able to snatch fromthe cupboards and refrigerator or swipe from each other and we began quietly plastering mustard or mayonnaise onour brightly colored food. The mood was one of deadly serious anticipation, a reward hard-won. The table wascrowded and Babette and Denise elbowed each other twice, although neither spoke. Wilder was still seated on thecounter surrounded by open cartons, crumpled tinfoil, shiny bags of potato chips, bowls of pasty substances coveredwith plastic wrap, flip-top rings and twist ties, individually wrapped slices of orange cheese. Heinrich came in,studied the scene carefully, my only son, then walked out the back door and disappeared.</p> 
<p>　　"This isn't the lunch I'd planned for myself," Babette said. "I was seriously thinking yogurt and wheat germ.""Where have we heard that before?" Denise said.</p> 
<p>　　"Probably right here," Steffie said.</p> 
<p>　　"She keeps buying that stuff.""But she never eats it," Steffie said.</p> 
<p>　　"Because she thinks if she keeps buying it, she'll have to eat it just to get rid of it. It's like she's trying to trick herself.""It takes up half the kitchen.""But she throws it away before she eats it because it goes bad," Denise said. "So then she starts the whole thing allover again.""Wherever you look," Steffie said, "there it is.""She feels guilty if she doesn't buy it, she feels guilty if she buys it and doesn't eat it, she feels guilty when she sees itin the fridge, she feels guilty when she throws it away.""It's like she smokes but she doesn't," Steffie said.</p> 
<p>　　Denise was eleven, a hard-nosed kid. She led a more or less daily protest against those of her mother's habits thatstruck her as wasteful or dangerous. I defended Babette. I told her I was the one who needed to show discipline inmatters of diet. I reminded her how much I liked the way she looked. I suggested there was an honesty inherent inbulkiness if it is just the right amount. People trust a certain amount of bulk in others.</p> 
<p>　　But she was not happy with her hips and thighs, walked at a rapid clip, ran up the stadium steps at the neoclassicalhigh school.</p> 
<p>　　She said I made virtues of her flaws because it was my nature to shelter loved ones from the truth. Something lurkedinside the truth, she said.</p> 
<p>　　The smoke alarm went off in the hallway upstairs, either to 'et us know the battery had just died or because the housewas on fire. We finished our lunch in silence.</p>
