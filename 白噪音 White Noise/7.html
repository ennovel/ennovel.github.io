Basically she is teaching them how to stand, sit and walk. Most of her students are old.</p> 
<p>　　It isn't clear to me why they want to improve their posture. We seem to believe it is possible to ward off death byfollowing rules of good grooming. Sometimes I go with my wife to the church basement and watch her stand, turn,assume various heroic poses, gesture gracefully. She makes references to yoga, kendo, trance-walking. She talks ofSufi dervishes, Sherpa mountaineers. The old folks nod and listen. Nothing is foreign, nothing too remote to apply. Iam always surprised at their acceptance and trust, the sweetness of their belief. Nothing is too doubtful to be of use tothem as they seek to redeem their bodies from a lifetime of bad posture. It is the end of skepticism. We walked homeunder a marigold moon. Our house looked old and wan at the end of the street, the porch light shining on a moldedplastic tricycle, a stack of three-hour colored-flame sawdust and wax logs. Denise was doing her homework in thekitchen, keeping an eye on Wilder, who had wandered downstairs to sit on the floor and stare through the ovenwindow. Silence in the halls, shadows on the sloping lawn. We closed the door and disrobed. The bed was a mess.</p> 
<p>　　Magazines, curtain rods, a child's sooty sock. Babette hummed something from a Broadway show, putting the rodsin a corner. We embraced, fell sideways to the bed in a controlled way, then repositioned ourselves, bathing in eachother's flesh, trying to kick the sheets off our ankles. Her body had a number of long hollows, places the hand mightstop to solve in the dark, tempo-slowing places. We believed something lived in the basement.</p> 
<p>　　"What do you want to do?" she said.</p> 
<p>　　"Whatever you want to do.""I want to do whatever's best for you.""What's best for me is to please you," I said.</p> 
<p>　　"I want to make you happy, Jack.""I'm happy when I'm pleasing you.""I just want to do what you want to do.""I want to do whatever's best for you.""But you please me by letting me please you," she said.</p> 
<p>　　"As the male partner I think it's my responsibility to please.""I'm not sure whether that's a sensitive caring statement or a sexist remark.""Is it wrong for the man to be considerate toward his partner?""I'm your partner when we play tennis, which we ought to start doing again, by the way. Otherwise I'm your wife. Doyou want me to read to you?""First-rate.""I know you like me to read sexy stuff.""I thought you liked it too.""Isn't it basically the person being read to who derives the benefit and the satisfaction? When I read to Old ManTreadwell, it's not because I find those tabloids stimulating.""Treadwell's blind, I'm not. I thought you liked to read erotic passages.""If it pleases you, then I like to do it.""But it has to please you too, Baba. Otherwise how would I feel?""It pleases me that you enjoy my reading.""I get the feeling a burden is being shifted back and forth. The burden of being the one who is pleased.""I want to read, Jack. Honestly.""Are you totally and completely sure? Because if you're not, we absolutely won't."Someone turned on the TV set at the end of the hall, and a woman's voice said: "If it breaks easily into pieces, it iscalled shale. When wet, it smells like clay."We listened to the gently plummeting stream of nighttime traffic.</p> 
<p>　　I said, "Pick your century. Do you want to read about Etruscan slave girls, Georgian rakes? I think we have someliterature on flagellation brothels. What about the Middle Ages? We have incubi and succubi. Nuns galore.""Whatever's best for you.""I want you to choose. It's sexier that way.""One person chooses, the other reads. Don't we want a balance, a sort of give-and-take? Isn't that what makes itsexy?""A tautness, a suspense. First-rate. I will choose.""I will read," she said. "But I don't want you to choose anything that has men inside women, quote-quote, or menentering women. 'I entered her.' 'He entered me.' We're not lobbies or elevators. 'I wanted him inside me,' as if hecould crawl completely in, sign the register, sleep, eat, so forth. Can we agree on that? I don't care what these peopledo as long as they don't enter or get entered.""Agreed.""'I entered her and began to thrust.'""I'm in total agreement," I said.</p> 
<p>　　"'Enter me, enter me, yes, yes.'""Silly usage, absolutely.""'Insert yourself, Rex. I want you inside me, entering hard, entering deep, yes, now, oh.'"I began to feel an erection stirring. How stupid and out of context. Babette laughed at her own lines. The TV said:</p> 
<p>　　"Until Florida surgeons attached an artificial flipper."Babette and I tell each other everything. I have told everything, such as it was at the time, to each of my wives. Thereis more to tell, of course, as marriages accumulate. But when I say I believe in complete disclosure I don't mean itcheaply, as anecdotal sport or shallow revelation. It is a form of self-renewal and a gesture of custodial trust. Lovehelps us develop an identity secure enough to allow itself to be placed in another's care and protection. Babette and Ihave turned our lives for each other's thoughtful regard, turned them in the moonlight in our pale hands, spoken deepinto the night about fathers and mothers, childhood, friendships, awakenings, old loves, old fears (except fear ofdeath). No detail must be left out, not even a dog with ticks or a neighbor's boy who ate an insect on a dare. The smellof pantries, the sense of empty afternoons, the feel of things as they rained across our skin, things as facts andpassions, the feel of pain, loss, disappointment, breathless delight. In these night recitations we create a spacebetween things as we felt them at the time and as we speak them now. This is the space reserved for irony, sympathyand fond amusement, the means by which we rescue ourselves from the past.</p> 
<p>　　I decided on the twentieth century. I put on my bathrobe and went down the hall to Heinrich's room to find a trashymagazine Babette might read from, the type that features letters from readers detailing their sexual experiences. Thisstruck me as one of the few things the modern imagination has contributed to the history of erotic practices. There isa double fantasy at work in such letters. People write down imagined episodes and then see them published in anational magazine. Which is the greater stimulation?</p> 
<p>　　Wilder was in there watching Heinrich do a physics experiment with steel balls and a salad bowl. Heinrich wore aterry cloth robe, a towel around his neck, another towel on his head. He told me to look downstairs.</p> 
<p>　　In a stack of material I found some family photo albums, one or two of them at least fifty years old. I took them up tothe bedroom. We spent hours going through them, sitting up in bed. Children wincing in the sun, women in sun hats,men shading their eyes from the glare as if the past possessed some quality of light we no longer experience, aSunday dazzle that caused people in their churchgoing clothes to tighten their faces and stand at an angle to the future,somewhat averted it seemed, wearing fixed and finedrawn smiles, skeptical of something in the nature of the boxcamera.</p> 
<p>　　Who will die first?</p>
