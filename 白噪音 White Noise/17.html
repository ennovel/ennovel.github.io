Who else can we get?"The next day Denise decided to confront her mother directly about the medication she was or was not taking, hopingto trick Babette into a confession, an admission or some minimal kind of flustered response. This was not a tactic thegirl and I had discussed but I couldn't help admiring the boldness of her timing. All six of us were jammed into thecar on our way to the Mid-Village Mall and Denise simply waited for a natural break in the conversation, directingher question toward the back of Babette's head, in a voice drained of inference.</p> 
<p>　　"What do you know about Dylar?""Is that the black girl who's staying with the Stovers?""That's Dakar," Steffie said.</p> 
<p>　　"Dakar isn't her name, it's where she's from," Denise said. "It's a country on the ivory coast of Africa.""The capital is Lagos," Babette said. "I know that because of a surfer movie I saw once where they travel all over theworld.""The Perfect Wave" Heinrich said. "I saw it on TV.""But what's the girl's name?" Steffie said.</p> 
<p>　　"I don't know," Babette said, "but the movie wasn't called The Perfect Wave. The perfect wave is what they werelooking for."'They go to Hawaii," Denise told Steffie, "and wait for these tidal waves to come from Japan. They're calledorigamis.""And the movie was called The Long Hot Summer," her mother said.</p> 
<p>　　"The Long Hot Summer," Heinrich said, "happens to be a play by Tennessee Ernie Williams.""It doesn't matter," Babette said, "because you can't copyright titles anyway.""If she's an African," Steffie said, "I wonder if she ever rode a camel."'Try an Audi Turbo.""Try a Toyota Supra.""What is it camels store in their humps?" Babette said. "Food or water? I could never get that straight.""There are one-hump camels and two-hump camels," Heinrich told her. "So it depends which kind you're talkingabout.""Are you telling me a two-hump camel stores food in one hump and water in the other?""The important thing about camels," he said, "is that camel meat is considered a delicacy.""I thought that was alligator meat," Denise said.</p> 
<p>　　"Who introduced the camel to America?" Babette said. "They had them out west for a while to carry supplies tocoolies who were building the great railroads that met at Ogden, Utah. I remember my history exams.""Are you sure you're not talking about llamas?" Heinrich said.</p> 
<p>　　"The llama stayed in Peru," Denise said. "Peru has the llama, the vicu.a and one other animal. Bolivia has tin. Chilehas copper and iron.""I'll give anyone in this car five dollars," Heinrich said, "if they can name the population of Bolivia.""Bolivians," my daughter said.</p> 
<p>　　The family is the cradle of the world's misinformation. There must be something in family life that generates factualerror. Over-closeness, the noise and heat of being. Perhaps something even deeper, like the need to survive. Murraysays we are fragile creatures surrounded by a world of hostile facts. Facts threaten our happiness and security. Thedeeper we delve into the nature of things, the looser our structure may seem to become. The family process workstoward sealing off the world. Small errors grow heads, fictions proliferate. I tell Murray that ignorance and confusioncan't possibly be the driving forces behind family solidarity. What an idea, what a subversion. He asks me why thestrongest family units exist in the least developed societies. Not to know is a weapon of survival, he says. Magic andsuperstition become entrenched as the powerful orthodoxy of the clan. The family is strongest where objectivereality is most likely to be misinterpreted. What a heartless theory, I say. But Murray insists it's true.</p> 
<p>　　In a huge hardware store at the mall I saw Eric Massingale, a former microchip sales engineer who changed his lifeby coming out here to join the teaching staff of the computer center at the Hill. He was slim and pale, with adangerous grin.</p> 
<p>　　"You're not wearing dark glasses, Jack.""I only wear them on campus.""I get it."We went our separate ways into the store's deep interior. A great echoing din, as of the extinction of a species of beast,filled the vast space. People bought twenty-two-foot ladders, six kinds of sandpaper, power saws that could fell trees.</p> 
<p>　　The aisles were long and bright, filled with oversized brooms, massive sacks of peat and dung, huge Rubbermaidgarbage cans. Rope hung like tropical fruit, beautifully braided strands, thick, brown, strong. What a great thing acoil of rope is to look at and feel. I bought fifty feet of Manila hemp just to have it around, show it to my son, talkabout where it comes from, how it's made. People spoke English, Hindi, Vietnamese, related tongues.</p> 
<p>　　I ran into Massingale again at the cash terminals.</p> 
<p>　　"I've never seen you off campus, Jack. You look different without your glasses and gown. Where did you get thatsweater? Is that a Turkish army sweater? Mail order, right?"He looked me over, felt the material of the water-repellent jacket I was carrying draped across my arm. Then hebacked up, altering his perspective, nodding a little, his grin beginning to take on a self-satisfied look, reflectingsome inner calculation.</p> 
<p>　　"I think I know those shoes," he said.</p> 
<p>　　What did he mean, he knew these shoes?</p> 
<p>　　"You're a different person altogether.""Different in what way, Eric?""You won't take offense?" he said, the grin turning lascivious, rich with secret meaning.</p> 
<p>　　"Of course not. Why would I?""Promise you won't take offense.""I won't take offense.""You look so harmless, Jack. A big, harmless, aging, indistinct sort of guy.""Why would I take offense?" I said, paying for my rope and hurrying out the door.</p> 
<p>　　The encounter put me in the mood to shop. I found the others and we walked across two parking lots to the mainstructure in the Mid-Village Mall, a ten-story building arranged around a center court of waterfalls, promenades andgardens. Babette and the kids followed me into the elevator, into the shops set along the tiers, through the emporiumsand department stores, puzzled but excited by my desire to buy. When I could not decide between two shirt" theyencouraged me to buy both. When I said I was hungry, they fed me pretzels, beer, souvlaki. The two girls scoutedahead, spotting things they thought I might want or need, running back to get me, to clutch my arms, plead with meto follow. They were my guides to endless well-being. People swarmed through the boutiques and gourmet shops.</p> 
<p>　　Organ music rose from the great court. We smelled chocolate, popcorn, cologne; we smelled rugs and furs, hangingsalamis and deathly vinyl. My family gloried in the event. I was one of them, shopping, at last. They gave me advice,badgered clerks on my behalf. I kept seeing myself unexpectedly in some reflecting surface. We moved from store tostore, rejecting not only items in certain departments, not only entire departments but whole stores, mammothcorporations that did not strike our fancy for one reason or another. There was always another store, three floors,eight floors, basement full of cheese graters and paring knives. I shopped with reckless abandon. I shopped forimmediate needs and distant contingencies. I shopped for its own sake, looking and touching, inspectingmerchandise I had no intention of buying, then buying it. I sent clerks into their fabric books and pattern books tosearch for elusive designs. I began to grow in value and self-regard. I filled myself out, found new aspects of myself,located a person I'd forgotten existed. Brightness settled around me. We crossed from furniture to men's wear,walking through cosmetics. Our images appeared on mirrored columns, in glassware and chrome, on TV monitors insecurity rooms. I traded money for goods. The more money I spent, the less important it seemed. I was bigger thanthese sums. These sums poured off my skin like so much rain. These sums in fact came back to me in the form ofexistential credit. I felt expansive, inclined to be sweepíngly generous, and told the kids to pick out their Christmasgifts here and now. I gestured in what I felt was an expansive manner. I could tell they were impressed. They fannedout across the area, each of them suddenly inclined to be private, shadowy, even secretive. Periodically one of themwould return to register the name of an item with Babette, careful not to let the others know what it was. I myself wasnot to be bothered with tedious details. I was the benefactor, the one who dispenses gifts, bonuses, bribes, baksheesh.</p> 
<p>　　The children knew it was the nature of such things that I could not be expected to engage in technical discussionsabout the gifts themselves. We ate another meal. A band played live Muzak. Voices rose ten stories from the gardensand promenades, a roar that echoed and swirled through the vast gallery, mixing with noises from the tiers, withshuffling feet and chiming bells, the hum of escalators, the sound of people eating, the human buzz of some vivid andhappy transaction.</p> 
<p>　　We drove home in silence. We went to our respective rooms, wishing to be alone. A little later I watched Steffie infront of the TV set. She moved her lips, attempting to match the words as they were spoken.</p>
