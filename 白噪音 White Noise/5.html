<p>　　At breakfast, Babette read all our horoscopes aloud, using her storytelling voice. I tried not to listen when she got tomine, although I think I wanted to listen, I think I sought some clues.</p> 
<p>　　After dinner, on my way upstairs, I heard the TV say: "Let's sit half lotus and think about our spines."That night, seconds after going to sleep, I seemed to fall through myself, a shallow heart-stopping plunge. Jarredawake, I stared into the dark, realizing I'd experienced the more or less normal muscular contraction known as themyoclonic jerk. Is this what it's like, abrupt, peremptory? Shouldn't death, I thought, be a swan dive, graceful,white-winged and smooth, leaving the surface undisturbed?</p> 
<p>　　Blue jeans tumbled in the dryer.</p> 
<p>　　We ran into Murray Jay Siskind at the supermarket. His basket held generic food and drink, nonbrand items in plainwhite packages with simple labeling. There was a white can labeled CANNED PEACHES. There was a whitepackage of bacon without a plastic window for viewing a representative slice. A jar of roasted nuts had a whitewrapper bearing the words IRREGULAR PEANUTS. Murray kept nodding to Babette as I introduced them.</p> 
<p>　　'This is the new austerity," he said. "Flavorless packaging. It appeals to me. I feel I'm not only saving money butcontributing to some kind of spiritual consensus. It's like World War HI. Everything is white. They'll take our brightcolors away and use them in the war effort."He was staring into Babette's eyes, picking up items from our cart and smelling them.</p> 
<p>　　"I've bought these peanuts before. They're round, cubical, pockmarked, seamed. Broken peanuts. A lot of dust at thebottom of the jar. But they taste good. Most of all I like the packages themselves. You were right, Jack. This is thelast avant-garde. Bold new forms. The power to shock."A woman fell into a rack of paperback books at the front of the store. A heavyset man emerged from the raisedcubicle in the far corner and moved warily toward her, head tilted to get a clearer sightline. A checkout girl said,"Leon, parsley," and he answered as he approached the fallen woman, "Seventy-nine." His breast pocket wascrammed with felt-tip pens.</p> 
<p>　　"So then you cook at the rooming house," Babette said.</p> 
<p>　　"My room is zoned for a hot plate. I'm happy there. I read the TV listings, I read the ads in Ufologist Today. I want toimmerse myself in American magic and dread. My seminar is going well. The students are bright and responsive.</p> 
<p>　　They ask questions and I answer them. They jot down notes as I speak. It's quite a surprise in my life."He picked up our bottle of extra-strength pain reliever and sniffed along the rim of the child-proof cap. He smelledour honeydew melons, our bottles of club soda and ginger ale. Babette went down the frozen food aisle, an area mydoctor had advised me to stay out of.</p> 
<p>　　"Your wife's hair is a living wonder," Murray said, looking closely into my face as if to communicate a deepeningrespect for me based on this new information.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes, it is," I said.</p> 
<p>　　"She has important hair.""I think I know what you mean.""I hope you appreciate that woman.""Absolutely.""Because a woman like that doesn't just happen.""I know it.""She must be good with children. More than that, I'll bet she's great to have around in a family tragedy. She'd be thetype to take control, show strength and affirmation.""Actually she falls apart. She fell apart when her mother died.""Who wouldn't?""She fell apart when Steffie called from camp with a broken bone in her hand. We had to drive all night. I foundmyself on a lumber company road. Babette weeping.""Her daughter, far away, among strangers, in pain. Who wouldn't?""Not her daughter. My daughter.""Not even her own daughter.""No.""Extraordinary. I have to love it."The three of us left together, trying to maneuver our shopping carts between the paperback books scattered across theentrance. Murray wheeled one of our carts into the parking lot and then helped us heave and push all ourdouble-bagged merchandise into the back of the station wagon. Cars entered and exited. The policewoman in herzippered minicab scouted the area for red flags on the parking meters. We added Murray's single lightweight bag ofwhite items to our load and headed across Elm in the direction of his rooming house. It seemed to me that Babetteand I, in the mass and variety of our purchases, in the sheer plenitude those crowded bags suggested, the weight andsize and number, the familiar package designs and vivid lettering, the giant sizes, the family bargain packs withDay-Glo sale stickers, in the sense of replenishment we felt, the sense of well-being, the security and contentmentthese products brought to some snug home in our souls—it seemed we had achieved a fullness of being that is notknown to people who need less, expect less, who plan their lives around lonely walks in the evening.</p> 
<p>　　Murray took Babette's hand on leaving.</p> 
<p>　　"I'd ask you to visit my room but it's too small for two people unless they're prepared to be intimate."Murray is able to produce a look that is sneaky and frank at the same time. It is a look that gives equal credence todisaster and lecherous success. He says that in the old days of his urban entanglements he believed there was onlyone way to seduce a woman, with clear and open desire. He took pains to avoid self-depreciation, self-mockery,ambiguity, irony, subtlety, vulnerability, a civilized world-weariness and a tragic sense of history— the very things,he says, that are most natural to him. Of these he has allowed only one element, vulnerability, to insert itselfgradually into his program of straightforward lust. He is trying to develop a vulnerability that women will findattractive. He works at it consciously, like a man in a gym with weights and a mirror. But his efforts so far haveproduced only this half sneaky look, sheepish and wheedling.</p> 
<p>　　He thanked us for the lift. We watched him walk toward the lopsided porch, propped with cinder blocks, where aman in a rocker stared into space.</p>
