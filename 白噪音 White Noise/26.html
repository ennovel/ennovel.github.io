Babette lay on her side staring into the clock-radio, listening to acall-in show. I heard a woman say: "In 1977 I looked in the mirror and saw the person I was becoming. I couldn't orwouldn't get out of bed. Figures moved at the edge of my vision, like with scurrying steps. I was getting phone callsfrom a Pershing missile base. I needed to talk to others who shared these experiences. I needed a support program,something to enroll in."I leaned across my wife's body and turned off the radio. She kept on staring. I kissed her lightly on the head.</p> 
<p>　　"Murray says you have important hair."She smiled in a pale and depleted way. I put down my notes and eased her around slightly so that she looked straightup as I spoke.</p> 
<p>　　"It's time for a major dialogue. You know it, I know it. You'll tell me all about Dylar. If not for my sake, then for yourlittle girl's. She's been worried—worried sick. Besides, you have no more room to maneuver. We've backed youagainst the wall. Denise and I. I found the concealed bottle, removed a tablet, had it analyzed by an expert. Thoselittle white disks are superbly engineered. Laser technology, advanced plastics. Dylar is almost as ingenious as themicroorganisms that ate the billowing cloud. Who would have believed in the existence of a little white pill thatworks as a pressure pump in the human body to provide medication safely and effectively, and self-destructs as well?</p> 
<p>　　I am struck by the beauty of this. We know something else, something crucially damaging to your case. We knowDylar is not available to the general public. This fact alone justifies our demands for an explanation. There's reallyvery little left for you to say. Just tell us the nature of the drag. As you well know, I don't have the temperament tohound people. But Denise is a different kind of person. I've been doing all I can to restrain her. If you don't tell mewhat I want to know, I'll unleash your little girl. She'll come at you with everything she has. She won't waste timetrying to make you feel guilty. Denise believes in a frontal attack. She'll hammer you right into the ground. Youknow I'm right, Babette."About five minutes passed. She lay there, staring into the ceiling.</p> 
<p>　　"Just let me tell it in my own way," she said in a small voice.</p> 
<p>　　"Would you like a liqueur?""No, thank you.""Take your time," I said. "We've got all night. If there's anything you want or need, just say so. You have only to ask.</p> 
<p>　　I'll be right here for as long as it takes."Another moment passed.</p> 
<p>　　"I don't know exactly when it started. Maybe a year and a half ago. I thought I was going through a phase, some kindof watermark period in my life.""Landmark," I said. "Or watershed.""A kind of settling-in-period, I thought. Middle age. Something like that. The condition would go away and I'd forgetall about it. But it didn't go away. I began to think it never would.""What condition?""Never mind that for now.""You've been depressed lately. I've never seen you like this. This is the whole point of Babette. She's a joyous person.</p> 
<p>　　She doesn't succumb to gloom or self-pity.""Let me tell it, Jack.""All right.""You know how I am. I think everything is correctible. Given the right attitude and the proper effort, a person canchange a harmful condition by reducing it to its simplest parts. You can make lists, invent categories, devise chartsand graphs. This is how I am able to teach my students how to stand, sit and walk, even though I know you thinkthese subjects are too obvious and nebulous and generalized to be reduced to component parts. I'm not a veryingenious person but I know how to break things down, how to separate and classify. We can analyze posture, wecan analyze eating, drinking and even breathing. How else do you understand the world, is my way of looking at it.""I'm right here," I said. "If there's anything you want or need, only say the word.""When I realized this condition was not about to go away, I set out to understand it better by reducing it to its parts.</p> 
<p>　　First I had to find out if it had any parts. I went to libraries and bookstores, read magazines and technical journals,watched cable TV, made lists and diagrams, made multicolored charts, made phone calls to technical writers andscientists, talked to a Sikh holy man in Iron City and even studied the occult, hiding the books in the attic so you andDenise wouldn't find them and wonder what was going on.""All this without my knowing. The whole point of Babette is that she speaks to me, she reveals and confides.""This is not a story about your disappointment at my silence. The theme of this story is my pain and my attempts toend it.""I'll make some hot chocolate. Would you like that?""Stay. This is a crucial part. All this energy, this research, study and concealment, but I was getting nowhere. Thecondition would not yield. It hung over my life, gave me no rest. Then one day I was reading to Mr. Treadwell fromthe National Examiner. An ad caught my eye. Never mind exactly what it said. Volunteers wanted for secret research.</p> 
<p>　　This is all you have to know.""I thought it was my former wives who practiced guile. Sweet deceivers. Tense, breathy, high-cheekboned,bilingual.""I answered the ad and was interviewed by a small firm doing research in psychobiology. Do you know what thatis?""No.""Do you know how complex the human brain is?""I have some idea.""No, you don't. Let's call the company Gray Research, although that's not the true name. Let's call my contact Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Gray. Mr. Gray is a composite. I was eventually in touch with three or four or more people at the firm.""One of those long low pale brick buildings with electrified fencing and low-profile shrubbery.""I never saw their headquarters. Never mind why. The point is I took test after test. Emotional, psychological, motorresponse, brain activity. Mr. Gray said there were three finalists and I was one of them.""Finalists for what?""We were to be test subjects in the development of a super experimental and top secret drug, code-name Dylar, thathe'd been working on for years. He'd found a Dylar receptor in the human brain and was putting the finishing toucheson the tablet itself. But he also told me there were dangers in running tests on a human. I could die. I could live butmy brain could die. The left side of my brain cquld die but the right side could live. This would mean that the left sideof my body would live but the right side would die. There were many grim specters. I could walk sideways but notforward. I could not distinguish words from things, so that if someone said 'speeding bullet,' I would fall to the floorand take cover. Mr. Gray wanted me to know the risks. There were releases and other documents for me to sign. Thefirm had lawyers, priests.""They let you go ahead, a human test animal.""No, they didn't. They said it was way too risky—legally, ethically and so forth. They went to work designingcomputer molecules and computer brains. I refused to accept this. I'd come so far, come so close. I want you to try tounderstand what happened next. If I'm going to tell you the story at all, I have to include this aspect of it, this grubbylittle corner of the human heart. You say Babette reveals and confides.""This is the point of Babette.""Good. I will reveal and confide. Mr. Gray and I made a private arrangement. Forget the priests, the lawyers, thepsychobiologists. We would conduct the experiments on our own. I would be cured of my condition, he would beacclaimed for a wonderful medical breakthrough.""What's so grubby about this?""It involved an indiscretion. This was the only way I could get Mr. Gray to let me use the drug. It was my last resort,my last hope. First I'd offered him my mind. Now I offered my body."I felt a sensation of warmth creeping up my back and radiating outward across my shoulders. Babette looked straightup. I was propped on an elbow, facing her, studying her features. When I spoke finally it was in a reasonable andinquiring voice—the voice of a man who seeks genuinely to understand some timeless human riddle.</p> 
<p>　　"How do you offer your body to a composite of three or more people? This is a compound person. He is like a policesketch of one person's eyebrows, another person's nose. Let's concentrate on the genitals. How many sets are wetalking about?""Just one person's, Jack. A key person, the project manager.""So we are no longer referring to the Mr. Gray who is a composite.""He is now one person. We went to a grubby little motel room. Never mind where or when. It had the TV up near theceiling. This is all I remember. Grubby, tacky. I was heartsick. But so, so desperate.""You call this an indiscretion, as if we haven't had a revolution in frank and bold language. Call it what it was,describe it honestly, give it the credit it deserves. You entered a motel room, excited by its impersonality, thefunctionalism and bad taste of the furnishings. You walked barefoot on the f.re-retardant carpet. Mr. Gray wentaround opening doors, looking for a full-length mirror. He watched you undress. You lay on the bed, embracing.</p> 
<p>　　Then he entered you.""Don't use that term. You know how I feel about that usage.""He effected what is called entry. In other words he inserted himself. One minute he was fully dressed, putting thecar rental keys on the dresser. The next minute he was inside you.""No one was inside anyone. That is stupid usage. I did what I had to do. I was remote. I was operating outside myself.</p> 
<p>　　It was a capitalist transaction. You cherish the wife who tells you everything. 1 am doing my best to be that person.</p> 
<p>　　"All right, I'm only trying to understand. How many times did you go to this motel?""More or less on a continuing basis for some months. That was the agreement."I felt heat rising along the back of my neck. I watched her carefully. A sadness showed in her eyes. I lay back andlooked at the ceiling. The radio came on. She began to cry softly.</p> 
<p>　　"There's some Jell-O with banana slices," I said. "Steffie made it.""She's a good girl.""I can easily get you some.""No, thank you.""Why did the radio come on?""The auto-timer is broken. I'll take it to the shop tomorrow.""I'll take it.""it's all right," she said. "It's no trouble. I can easily take it.""Did you enjoy having sex with him?""I only remember the TV up near the ceiling, aimed down at us.""Did he have a sense of humor? I know women appreciate men who can joke about sex. I can't, unfortunately, andafter this I don't think there's much chance I'll be able to learn.""It's better if you know him as Mr. Gray. That's all. He's not tall, short, young or old. He doesn't laugh or cry. It's foryour own good.""I have a question. Why didn't Gray Research run tests on animals? Animals must be better than computers in somerespects."'That's just the point. No animal has this condition. This is a human condition. Animals fear many things, Mr. Graysaid. But their brains aren't sophisticated enough to accommodate this particular state of mind."For the first time I began to get an inkling of what she'd been talking about all along. My body went cold. I felthollow inside. I rose from my supine position, once again propping myself on an elbow to look down at her. Shestarted to cry again.</p> 
<p>　　"You have to tell me, Babette. You've taken me this far, put me through this much. I have to know. What's thecondition?"The longer she wept, the more certain I became that I knew what she was going to say. I felt an impulse to get dressedand leave, take a room somewhere until this whole thing blew over. Babette raised her face to me, sorrowing andpale, her eyes showing a helpless desolation. We faced each other, propped on elbows, like a sculpture of loungingphilosophers in a classical academy. The radio turned itself off.</p> 
<p>　　"I'm afraid to die," she said. "I think about it all the time. It won't go away.""Don't tell me this. This is terrible.""I can't help it. How can I help it?""I don't want to know. Save it for our old age. You're still young, you get plenty of exercise. This is not a reasonablefear.""It haunts me, Jack. I can't get it off my mind. I know I'm not supposed to experience such a fear so consciously andso steadily. What can I do? It's just there. That's why I was so quick to notice Mr. Gray's ad in the tabloid I wasreading aloud. The headline hit home. FEAR OF DEATH, it said. I think about it all the time. You're disappointed. Ican tell.""Disappointed?""You thought the condition would be more specific. I wish it was. But a person doesn't search for months and monthsto corner the solution to some daily little ailment."I tried to talk her out of it.</p> 
<p>　　"How can you be sure it is death you fear? Death is so vague. No one knows what it is, what it feels like or looks like.</p> 
<p>　　Maybe you just have a personal problem that surfaces in the form of a great universal subject.""What problem?""Something you're hiding from yourself. Your weight maybe.""I've lost weight. What about my height?""I know you've lost weight. That's just my point. You practically ooze good health. You reek of it. Hookstrattenconfirms this, your own doctor. There must be something else, an underlying problem.""What could be more underlying than death?"I tried to persuade her it was not as serious as she thought.</p> 
<p>　　"Baba, everyone fears death. Why should you be different? You yourself said earlier it is a human condition. There'sno one who has lived past the age of seven who hasn't worried about dying.""At some level everyone fears death. I fear it right up front. I don't know how or why it happened. But I can't be theonly one or why would Gray Research spend millions on a pill?""That's what I said. You're not the only one. There are hundreds of thousands of people. Isn't it reassuring to knowthat? You're like the woman on the radio who got phone calls from a missile base. She wanted to find others whoseown psychotic experiences would make her feel less isolated.""But Mr. Gray said I was extra sensitive to the terror of death. He gave me a battery of tests. That's why he was eagerto use me."'This is what I find odd. You concealed your terror for so long. If you're able to conceal such a thing from a husbandand children, maybe it is not so severe."'This is not the story of a wife's deception. You can't sidestep the true story, Jack. It is too big."I kept my voice calm. I spoke to her as one of those reclining philosophers might address a younger member of theacademy, someone whose work is promising and fitfully brilliant but perhaps too heavily dependent on thescholarship of the senior fellow.</p> 
<p>　　"Baba, I am the one in this family who is obsessed by death. I have always been the one.""You never said."'To protect you from worry. To keep you animated, vital and happy. You are the happy one. I am the doomed fool.</p> 
<p>　　That's what I can't forgive you for. Telling me you're not the woman I believed you were. I'm hurt, I'm devastated.""I always thought of you as someone who might muse on death. You might take walks and muse. But all those timeswe talked about who will die first, you never said you were afraid.""The same goes for you. 'As soon as the kids are grown.' You made it sound like a trip to Spain.""I do want to die first," she said, "but that doesn't mean I'm not afraid. I'm terribly afraid. I'm afraid all the time.""I've been afraid for more than half my life.""What do you want me to say? Your fear is older and wiser than mine?""I wake up sweating. I break out in killer sweats.""I chew gum because my throat constricts.""I have no body. I'm only a mind or a self, alone in a vast space.""I seize up," she said.</p> 
<p>　　"I'm too weak to move. I lack all sense of resolve, determination.""I thought about my mother dying. Then she died.""I think about everyone dying. Not just myself. I lapse into terrible reveries.""I felt so guilty. I thought her death was connected to my thinking about it. I feel the same way about my own death.</p> 
<p>　　The more I think about it, the sooner it will happen.""How strange it is. We have these deep terrible lingering fears about ourselves and the people we love. Yet we walkaround, talk to people, eat and drink. We manage to function. The feelings are deep and real. Shouldn't they paralyzeus? How is it we can survive them, at least for a while? We drive a car, we teach a class. How is it no one sees howdeeply afraid we were, last night, this morning? Is it something we all hide from each other, by mutual consent? Ordo we share the same secret without knowing it? Wear the same disguise.""What if death is nothing but sound?""Electrical noise.""You hear it forever. Sound all around. How awful.""Uniform, white.""Sometimes it sweeps over me," she said. "Sometimes it insinuates itself into my mind, little by little. I try to talk toit. Not now, Death.'""I lie in the dark looking at the clock. Always odd numbers. One thirty-seven in the morning. Three fifty-nine in themorning.""Death is odd-numbered. That's what the Sikh told me. The holy man in Iron City.""You're my strength, my life-force. How can I persuade you that this is a terrible mistake? I've watched you batheWilder, iron my gown. These deep and simple pleasures are lost to me now. Don't you see the enormity of whatyou've done?""Sometimes it hits me like a blow," she said. "I almost physically want to reel."- "Is this why I married Babette? So she would conceal the truth from me, conceal objects from me, join in a sexualconspiracy at my expense? All plots move in one direction," I told her grimly.</p> 
<p>　　We held each other tightly for a long time, our bodies clenched in an embrace that included elements of love, grief,tenderness, sex and struggle. How subtly we shifted emotions, found shadings, using the scantest movement of ourarms, our loins, the slightest intake of breath, to reach agreement on our fear, to advance our competition, to assertour root desires against the chaos in our souls.</p> 
<p>　　Leaded, unleaded, super unleaded.</p> 
<p>　　We lay naked after love, wet and gleaming. I pulled the covers up over us. We spoke in drowsv whispers for a while.</p> 
<p>　　The radio came on.</p> 
<p>　　"I'm right here," I said. "Whatever you want or need, however difficult, tell me and it's done.""A drink of water.""Of course.""I'll go with you," she said.</p> 
<p>　　"Stay, rest.""I don't want to be alone."We put on our robes, went to the bathroom for water. She drank while I pissed. On our way back to the bedroom I putmy arm around her and we walked half toppling toward each other, like adolescents on a beach. I waited by the sideof the bed as she rearranged the sheets neatly, put the pillows in place. She curled up immediately for sleep but therewere still things I wanted to know, things I had to say.</p> 
<p>　　"Precisely what was accomplished by the people at Gray Research?""They isolated the fear-of-death part of the brain. Dylar speeds relief to that sector.""Incredible.""It's not just a powerful tranquilizer. The drug specifically interacts with neurotransmitters in the brain that arerelated to the fear of death. Every emotion or sensation has its own neurotransmitters. Mr. Gray found fear of deathand then went to worl on finding the chemicals that would induce the brain to make its own inhibitors.""Amazing and frightening.""Everything that goes on in your whole life is a result of molecules rushing around somewhere in your brain.""Heinrich's brain theories. They're all true. We're the sum of our chemical impulses. Don't tell me this. It's unbearableto think about.""They can trace everything you say, do and feel to the number of molecules in a certain region.""What happens to good and evil in this system? Passion, envy and hate? Do they become a tangle of neurons? Areyou telling me that a whole tradition of human failings is now at an end, that cowardice, sadism, molestation aremeaningless terms? Are we being asked to regard these things nostalgically? What about murderous rage? Amurderer used to have a certain fearsome size to him. His crime was large. What happens when we reduce it to cellsand molecules? My son plays chess with a murderer. He told me all this. I didn't want to listen.""Can I sleep now?""Wait. If Dylar speeds relief, why have you been so sad these past days, staring into space?""Simple. The drug's not working."Her voice broke when she said these words. She raised the comforter over her head. I could only stare at the hillyterrain. A man on talk radio said: "I was getting mixed messages about my sexuality." I stroked her head and bodyover the quilted bedspread.</p> 
<p>　　"Can you elaborate, Baba? I'm right here. I want to help.""Mr. Gray gave me sixty tablets in two bottles. This would be more than enough, he said. One tablet everyseventy-two hours. The discharge of medication is so gradual and precise that there's no overlapping from one pill tothe next. I finished the first bottle sometime in late November, early December.""Denise found it.""She did?""She's been on your trail ever since.""Where did I leave it?""In the kitchen trash.""Why did I do that? That was careless.""What about the second bottle?" I said.</p> 
<p>　　"You found the second bottle.""I know. I'm asking how many tablets you've taken.""I've now taken twenty-five from that bottle. That's fifty-five all told. Five left.""Four left. I had one analyzed.""Did you tell me that?""Yes. And has there been any change at all in your condition.</p> 
<p>　　She allowed the top of her head to emerge.</p> 
<p>　　"At first I thought so. The very beginning was the most hopeful time. Since then no improvement. I've grown moreand more discouraged. Let me sleep now, Jack.""Remember we had dinner at Murray's one night? On the way home we talked about your memory lapses. You saidyou weren't sure whether or not you were taking medication. You couldn't remember, you said. This was a lie, ofcourse.""I guess so," she said.</p> 
<p>　　"But you weren't lying about memory lapses in general. Denise and I assumed your forgetfulness was a side effect ofwhatever drug you were taking."The whole head emerged.</p> 
<p>　　"Totally wrong," she said. "It wasn't a side effect of the drug. It was a side effect of the condition. Mr. Gray said myloss of memory is a desperate attempt to counteract my fear of death. It's like a war of neurons. I am able to forgetmany things but I fail when it comes to death. And now Mr. Gray has failed as well.""Does he know that?""I left a message on his answering machine.""What did; he say when he called back?""He sent me a tape in the mail, which I took over to the Stovers to play. He said he was literally sorry, whatever thatmeans. He said I was not the right subject after all. He is sure it will work someday, soon, with someone, somewhere.</p> 
<p>　　He said he made a mistake with me. It was too random. He was too eager."It was the middle of the night. We were both exhausted. But we'd come so far, said so much, that I knew we couldn'tstop just yet. I took a deep breath. Then I lay back, staring into the ceiling. Babette leaned across my body to turn offthe lamp. Then she pressed a button on the radio, killing the voices. A thousand other nights had ended more or lesslike this. I felt her sink into the bed.</p> 
<p>　　'There's something I promised myself I wouldn't tell you.""Can it wait until morning?" she said.</p> 
<p>　　"I'm tentatively scheduled to die. It won't happen tomorrow or the next day. But it is in the works."I went on to tell her about my exposure to Nyodene D., speaking matter-of-factly, tonelessly, in short declarativesentences. I told her about the computer technician, the way he'd tapped into my history to produce a pessimisticmassive tally. We are the sum total of our data, I told her, just as we are the sum total of our chemical impulses. I triedto explain how hard I'd struggled to keep the news from her. But after her own revelations, this seemed the wrongkind of secret to be keeping.</p> 
<p>　　"So -we are no longer talking about fear and floating terror," I said. "This is the hard and heavy thing, the fact itself."Slowly she emerged from beneath the covers. She climbed on top of me, sobbing. I felt her fingers clawing at myshoulders and neck. The warm tears fell on my lips. She beat me on the chest, seized my left hand and bit the fleshbetween the thumb and index finger. Her sobs became a grunting sound, full of terrible desperate effort. She took myhead in her hands, gently and yet fiercely, and rocked it to and fro on the pillow, an act I could not connect toanything she'd ever done, anything she seemed to be.</p> 
<p>　　Later, after she'd fallen off my body and into a restless sleep, I kept on staring into the dark. The radio came on. Ithrew off the covers and went into the bathroom. Denise's scenic paperweights sat on a dusty shelf by the door. I ranwater over my hands and wrists. I splashed cold water on my face. The only towel around was a small pink handclothwith a tic-tac-toe design. I dried myself slowly and carefully. Then I tilted the radiator cover away from the wall andstuck my hand underneath. The bottle of Dylar was gone.</p>
