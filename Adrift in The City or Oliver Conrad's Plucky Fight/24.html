<br> 
<br> "There are many Joneses in the world," he said, "but Rupert is an uncommon name. I didn't think there'd be more than one with that handle to his name. If he's alive I'll find him."
<br> 
<br> "Why don't you enquire of somebody that knew him?" asked Oliver.
<br> 
<br> "The thing is to find such a one," said Bundy. "There's been many changes in twenty years."
<br> 
<br> "Don't you know of some tradesman that he used to patronize, Mr. Bundy?"
<br> 
<br> "The very thing!" exclaimed the miner, for so I shall sometimes designate Mr. Bundy. "There's one man that may tell me about him."
<br> 
<br> "Who is that?"
<br> 
<br> "He kept a drinking-place down near Fulton Ferry. He may be living yet. I'll go and see him."
<br> 
<br> So one morning Nicholas Bundy, accompanied by Oliver, took the Third Avenue cars and went downtown. They got out near the Astor House, and made their way to the old place, which Bundy remembered well. To his great joy he found it—a little shabbier, a little dirtier, but in other respects the same.
<br> 
<br> They entered. Behind the bar stood a man of nearly sixty, whose bloated figure and dull red face indicated that he appreciated what he sold to others.
<br> 
<br> "What will you have, gentlemen?" he asked briskly.
<br> 
<br> Nicholas Bundy surveyed his countenance attentively.
<br> 
<br> "Are you Jacob Spratt?" he asked.
<br> 
<br> "Yes," answered the bartender. "Do you know me?"
<br> 
<br> "I knew you twenty years ago," answered the miner.
<br> 
<br> "I don't remember you."
<br> 
<br> "You once knew me well."
<br> 
<br> "I have seen many faces in my time. I can't remember so many years back."
<br> 
<br> "Do you recall the name of Nicholas Bundy?"
<br> 
<br> "Ay, that I do. You used to come here with a man named Jones."
<br> 
<br> "Yes—Rupert Jones. Can you tell me where he is now?"
<br> 
<br> Jacob shook his head.
<br> 
<br> "He left New York not long after you did," he answered. "He went to Chicago."
<br> 
<br> "Are you sure of that?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, and I'll tell you why. He came here one evening and says: 'Jacob, I'm going away. You won't see me for a long time—I'm going to Chicago.'"
<br> 
<br> "Did he tell you why he was going there?"
<br> 
<br> "He said he was going there as an agent for a New York house—that he had a good chance."
<br> 
<br> "You have never seen him since?"
<br> 
<br> "No," said Jacob. Then he added meditatively: "Once I thought I saw him. There was a man I met in the street looking as like him as two peas, makin' allowance for the years he was older. I went up to him and called him by name, but he colored up and looked annoyed, and told me I was quite mistaken; that his name wasn't Jones, but something else—I don't remember what now. Of course I axed his pardon and walked on, but he was the very picture of Rupert Jones."
<br> 
<br> "Then you feel sure that he went to Chicago?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, he told me so, and that was the last time I saw him. If he had stayed in the city he would have kept on comin' to my place, or I should have met him somewhere."
<br> 
<br> Nicholas Bundy thanked the old man for his information, and ordered glasses of lemonade for himself and Oliver.
<br> 
<br> "Won't you have something stronger, Mr. Bundy?" asked the barkeeper insinuatingly.
<br> 
<br> Bundy shook his head.
<br> 
<br> "I've given up liquor," he said. "I'm better off without it, and so will the boy be. What do you say, Oliver?"
<br> 
<br> "I agree with you, sir," said Oliver promptly.
<br> 
<br> "Lucky for me all don't think so," said Spratt. "It 'ould ruin my business."
<br> 
<br> When they left the bar-room Nicholas Bundy turned to his young companion.
<br> 
<br> "Oliver," he said, "will you go with me to Chicago?"
<br> 
<br> "I shall be glad to go," said Oliver promptly.
<br> 
<br> "Then we will start in two or three days, as soon as I have made some business arrangements."
<br> 
<br> "Mr. Bundy," said Oliver honestly, "it will cost you considerable to pay my expenses. I should like very much to go, but do you think it will pay you to take me?"
<br> 
<br> "You're considerate, boy, but don't trouble yourself about that. You are company to me, and I'm willing to pay your expenses for that, let alone the help you may give me."
<br> 
<br> "Thank you, Mr. Bundy. Then I will say no more. What day do you think you will start?"
<br> 
<br> "To-day is Tuesday. We will start on Saturday. Can you be ready?"
<br> 
<br> Oliver laughed.
<br> 
<br> "There won't be much getting ready for me," he said. "All my business arrangements can be made in half an hour."
<br> 
<br> Bundy smiled. Our hero's good spirits seemed to enliven his own. He was not only getting used to Oliver's company, but sincerely attached to him.
