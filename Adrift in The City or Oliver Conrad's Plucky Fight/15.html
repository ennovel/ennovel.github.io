JOHN'S COURTSHIP.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      O LIVER didn't go back to his native village. Mr. Kenyon sent on his trunk, and thus obviated the necessity. Our hero took up his quarters at a cheap hotel until, with the help of John Meadows, he obtained a room in St. Mark's Place. The room was a large square one, tolerably well furnished. The price asked was four dollars a week.
<br> 
<br> "That is rather more than I ought to pay just for a room," said Oliver.
<br> 
<br> "I'll tell you how you can get it cheaper," said John Meadows.
<br> 
<br> "How?"
<br> 
<br> "Take me for your room-mate. I'll pay a dollar and a half toward the rent."
<br> 
<br> Oliver hesitated, but finally decided to accept John's offer. Though his fellow-clerk was not altogether to his taste, it would prevent his feeling lonely, and he had no other acquaintances to select from.
<br> 
<br> "All right," he said.
<br> 
<br> "Is it a bargain?" said John, delighted. "I'll give my Bleecker Street landlady notice right off. Why, I shall feel like a prince here!"
<br> 
<br> "Then this is better than your room?"
<br> 
<br> "You bet! That's only big enough for a middling sized cat, while this――"
<br> 
<br> "Is big enough for two large ones," said Oliver, smiling.
<br> 
<br> "Yes, and a whole litter of kittens into the bargain. We'll have a jolly time together."
<br> 
<br> "I hope so."
<br> 
<br> "Of course," said John seriously, "when I get married that'll terminate the contract."
<br> 
<br> "Do you think of getting married soon?" asked Oliver, surprised and amused.
<br> 
<br> "I'll tell you about it," said John, with the utmost gravity. "Last month I had my fortune told."
<br> 
<br> "Well?"
<br> 
<br> "It was told by Mme. Catalina, the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter; so, of course, she wasn't a humbug."
<br> 
<br> "Does that make any difference—being the seventh daughter?"
<br> 
<br> "Of course it does. Well, she told me that I should marry a rich widow, and ever after live in luxury," said John, evidently elated by his prospects.
<br> 
<br> "Did you believe her?"
<br> 
<br> "Of course I did. She told things that I knew to be true about the past, and that convinced me she could foretell the future."
<br> 
<br> "Such as what?"
<br> 
<br> "She told me I had lately had a letter from a person who was interested in me. So I had. I got a letter from Charlie Cameron only a week before. Me and Charlie went to school together, so, of course, he feels interested in me."
<br> 
<br> "What else?"
<br> 
<br> "She said a girl with black eyes was in love with me."
<br> 
<br> "Is that true?"
<br> 
<br> John nodded complacently.
<br> 
<br> "Who is it?"
<br> 
<br> "I don't know her name, but I've met her two or three times on the street, and she always looked at me and smiled."
<br> 
<br> "Struck with your looks, I suppose," suggested Oliver.
<br> 
<br> John stroked an incipient mustache and stole a look into the glass.
<br> 
<br> "Looks like it," he said.
<br> 
<br> "If she were only a rich widow you wouldn't mind cultivating her acquaintance?"
<br> 
<br> "I wish she were," said John thoughtfully.
<br> 
<br> "You haven't any widow in view, have you?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, I have," said John, rather to Oliver's surprise.
<br> 
<br> "Who is it?"
<br> 
<br> "Her husband used to keep a lager-beer saloon on Bleecker Street, and now the widow carries it on. I've enquired about, and I hear she's worth ten thousand dollars. Would you like to see her?"
<br> 
<br> "Very much," answered Oliver, whose curiosity was excited.
<br> 
<br> "Come along, then. We'll drop in and get a couple of glasses of something."
<br> 
<br> Following his guide, or rather side by side, Oliver walked round to the saloon.
<br> 
<br> "Does she know you admire her?" enquired Oliver.
<br> 
<br> "I don't," said John. "I admire her money."
<br> 
<br> "Would you be willing to sell yourself?"
<br> 
<br> "For ten thousand dollars? I guess I would. That's the easiest way of getting rich. It would take me two hundred years, at eight dollars a week, to make such a fortune."
<br> 
<br> They entered the saloon. Behind the counter stood a woman of thirty-five, weighing upward of two hundred pounds. She looked good-natured, but the idea of a marriage between her and John Meadows, a youth of nineteen, seemed too ridiculous.
<br> 
<br> "What will you have?" she asked, in a Teutonic accent.
<br> 
<br> "Sarsaparilla and lager!" answered John.
<br> 
<br> Frau Winterhammer filled two mugs in the most business-like manner. She evidently had no idea that John was an admirer.
<br> 
<br> In the same business-like manner she received the money he laid on the counter.
<br> 
<br> John smacked his lips in affected delight.
<br> 
<br> "It is very good," he said. "Your lager is always good, Mrs. Winterhammer."
<br> 
<br> "So!" replied the good woman.
<br> 
<br> "That's so!" repeated John.
<br> 
<br> "Then perhaps you comes again," said the frau, with an eye to business.
<br> 
<br> "Oh, yes; I'll be sure to come again," said John, with a tender significance which was quite lost upon the matter-of-fact lady.
<br> 
<br> "And you bring your friends, too," she suggested.
<br> 
<br> "Yes; I will bring my friends."
<br> 
<br> "Dat is good," said Mrs. Winterhammer, in a satisfied tone.
<br> 
<br> Having no excuse for stopping longer the two friends went out.
<br> 
<br> "What do you think of her, Oliver?" asked John.
<br> 
<br> "There's a good deal of her," answered Oliver, using a non-committal phrase.
<br> 
<br> "Yes, she's rather plump," said John. "I don't like a skeleton, for my part."
<br> 
<br> "She doesn't look much like one."
<br> 
<br> "She's good-looking; don't you think so?" enquired John, looking anxiously in his companion's face.
<br> 
<br> "She looks pleasant; but, John, she's a good deal older than you."
<br> 
<br> "She's about thirty."
<br> 
<br> "Nearer forty."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, no, she isn't. And she's worth ten thousand dollars! Think, Oliver, how nice it would be to be worth ten thousand dollars! I wouldn't clerk it for old Bond any more, I can tell you that."
<br> 
<br> "Would you keep the saloon?"
<br> 
<br> "No, I'd let her keep that and I'd set up in something else. We'd double the money in a short time and then I'd retire and go to Europe."
<br> 
<br> "That's all very well, John; but suppose she won't have you?"
<br> 
<br> John smiled—a self-satisfied smile.
<br> 
<br> "She wouldn't reject a stylish young fellow like me—do you think she would? She'd feel flattered to get such a young husband."
<br> 
<br> "Perhaps she would," said Oliver, who thought John under a strange hallucination. "You must invite me to the wedding whenever it comes off, John."
<br> 
<br> "You shall be my groomsman," answered John confidently.
<br> 
<br> A week later John said to Oliver after supper:
<br> 
<br> "Oliver, I'm goin' to do it."
<br> 
<br> "To do what?"
<br> 
<br> "I'm goin' to propose to the widder to-night."
<br> 
<br> "So soon!"
<br> 
<br> "Yes; I'm tired of workin' for old Bond; I want to go in for myself."
<br> 
<br> "Well, John, I wish you good luck, but I shall be sorry to lose you for a room-mate."
<br> 
<br> "Lend me a necktie, won't you, Oliver? I want to take her eye, you know."
<br> 
<br> So Oliver lent his most showy necktie to his room-mate, and John departed on his important mission.
<br> 
<br> About half an hour later John rushed into the room in a violent state of excitement, his collar and bosom looking as if they had been soaked in dirty water, and sank into a chair.
<br> 
<br> "What's the matter?" asked Oliver.
<br> 
<br> "I've cast her off!" answered John in a hollow voice. "She is a faithless deceiver."
<br> 
<br> "Tell me all about it, Jack."
<br> 
<br> John told his story. He went to the saloon, ordered a glass of lager, and after drinking it asked the momentous question. Frau Winterhammer seemed surprised, said "So!" and then called "Fritz!" A stout fellow in shirt-sleeves came out of a rear room, and the widow said something to him in German. Then he seized John's arms, and the widow deliberately threw the contents of a pitcher of lager in his face and bosom. Then both laughed rudely, and John was released.
<br> 
<br> "What shall you do about it, John?" asked Oliver, with difficulty refraining from laughing.
<br> 
<br> "I have cast her off!" he said gloomily, "I will never enter the saloon again."
<br> 
<br> "I wouldn't," said Oliver.
<br> 
<br> Oliver would have felt less like laughing had he known that at that very moment Ezekiel Bond, prompted by Mr. Kenyon, was conspiring to get him into trouble.
