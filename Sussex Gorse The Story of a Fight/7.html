His mother made one or two small remarks which passed unheeded. She noticed that his arm, on which her hand lay, was very tense.
<br> 
<br> When they came to the group of cottages at the Forstal, a girl ran down the garden path and leaned against the fence. She was a pretty brown girl, and as they went by she smiled at Reuben. But he did not seem to see her, he walked steadily on, and she slunk[Pg 29] back to the house, biting her lips. "Dudn't he see me, or wur he jest pretending not to?" she muttered.
<br> 
<br> At Odiam dinner was waiting. It was a generous meal, which combined the good things of this world with the right amount of funereal state. Several of the neighbours had been invited, and the housewife wished to do them honour, knowing that her table boasted luxuries not to be found at other farms—a bottle of French wine, for instance, which though nobody touched it, gave distinction to the prevalent ale, and one or two light puddings, appealing to the eye as well as to the palate. As soon as the meal was over and the guests had gone, Reuben took himself off, and did not reappear till supper-time.
<br> 
<br> During dinner he had been even more thoughtful than the occasion warranted, leaving his mother and Harry to talk to the company, though he had taken with a certain dignity his place as host and head of the house. Now at supper he was still inclined to silence. A servant girl laid the dishes on the table, then retired. Mrs. Backfield and Harry spoke in low tones to each other.
<br> 
<br> ... "Mother, how much did this chocolate cost wot we're drinking?" Reuben's voice made them both jump.
<br> 
<br> "How much? why, two shillings a pound," said Mrs. Backfield, rather surprised.
<br> 
<br> "That's too much." Reuben's brows and mouth were straight lines.
<br> 
<br> "Wot d'you mean, Reuben?"
<br> 
<br> "Why, two shillings is too much fur farm-folks lik us to give fur a pound of chocolate. It's naun but a treat, and we can do wudout it."
<br> 
<br> "But we've bin drinking chocolate fur a dunnamany years now—your poor f?ather always liked it—and I d?an't see why we should stop it."
<br> 
<br> "Look'ee, mother, I've something to tell you. I've a plan in my head, and it'll justabout mean being shut of[Pg 30] a lot of things besides chocolate. I know f?ather dudn't care much about the farm, about m?aking it grow and buying more land, and all that. But I do. I mean to buy the whole of Boarzell."
<br> 
<br> There was a gasping silence.
<br> 
<br> "The whole of Boarzell," repeated Reuben.
<br> 
<br> He might have said the whole world, to judge by his mother's and Harry's faces.
<br> 
<br> "Yes—I mean every bit, even the bit Grandturzel's got now. Squire he w?an't be sorry to sell it, and I mean to buy it piece by piece. I'll buy my first piece at the end of this year. We must start saving money at wunst. But I can't do naun wudout you help me, you two."
<br> 
<br> "Wot d'you want to go buying Boarzell fur?" asked Mrs. Backfield in a bewildered voice; "the farm's pr?aper as it is—we d?an't want it no bigger."
<br> 
<br> "And Boarzell's wicked tedious stuff," put in Harry; "naun'll grow there but gorse."
<br> 
<br> "I'll have a good grain growing there in five year—d?an't you go doubting it. The ground wants working, that's all. And as fur not wanting the farm no bigger, that wur f?ather's idea—Odiam's mine now."
<br> 
<br> "Why can't we jest go on being happy and comfortable, lik we wur before?"
<br> 
<br> "Because I've thought of something much grander, surelye. I'm going to m?ake us all gurt people, and this a gurt farm. But you've got to help me, you and Harry."
<br> 
<br> "Wot d'you want us to do?"
<br> 
<br> "Well, first of all, we must save all the money we can, and not go drinking chocolate and French wine, and eating sweet puddens and all such dentical stuff. And then, Harry and me, we're valiant chaps, and there never wur enough work for us to do. I'm going to send Blackman away—Harry and I can do quite easily wudout him and save his wages."
<br> 
<br> "Send away Blackman!—oh, Ben, he's bin with us fifteen year."
<br> 
<br> "I d?an't care if he's bin a hunderd. There ?un't enough work for three men on this farm, and it's a shame to go wasting ten shilling a week. Oh, mother, can't you see how glorious it'll be? I know f?ather wanted different, but I've bin thinking and dreaming of this fur years."
<br> 
<br> "You always wur queer about Boarzell. But your f?ather 'ud turn in his grave to think of you sending off Blackman."
<br> 
<br> "He'll easily git another pl?ace—I'll find him one myself. And, mother—there's something more. Now you haven't got f?ather to work fur, you'll find the time unaccountable long. Wot if you let Becky go, and did the cooking and that yourself?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, Reuben...."
<br> 
<br> "You shouldn't ought to ask mother that," said Harry. "She '?un't used to work. It's well enough fur you and me, we're strong chaps, and there's no reason we shouldn't pull to a bit. But mother, she'd never do wudout the girl—you see, there's the dairy and the fowls as well as the house."
<br> 
<br> "We could help her out of doors."
<br> 
<br> "Lard!—you want some work!"
<br> 
<br> Reuben sprang to his feet. "Yes—I do! You're justabout right there. I'm starved fur work. I've never really worked in my life, and now I want to work till I drop. Look at my arm"—and he showed them his brown hairy arm, where the muscles swelled in lumps under the skin—"that's a workman's arm, and it's never worked yet—pr?aperly. You let me send off Blackman and Becky, and see how we manage wudout 'em. I'll do most of the work myself, I promise you. I couldn't have too much."
<br> 
<br> "You're a queer lad, Reuben—and more masterful than your poor f?ather wur."
<br> 
<br> "Yes—I'm master here." He sat down, and looked round the table quite calmly. A vague uneasiness disturbed Mrs. Backfield and Harry. For some unfathomable reason they both felt a little afraid of Reuben.
<br> 
<br> He finished his supper and went out of the kitchen. Harry and his mother sat for a moment or two in silence.
<br> 
<br> "He always wur queer about Boarzell," said Mrs. Backfield at last; "you remember that time years ago when he got mixed up wud the riot? I said to his f?ather then as I was sure Ben 'ud want to do something crazy wud the farm. But I never thought he'd so soon be m?aster," and a tear trickled over her smooth cheek.
<br> 
<br> "I d?an't see no harm in his buying a bit of Boarzell if it's going cheap—but it ?un't worth m?aking all ourselves uncomfortable for it."
<br> 
<br> "No. Howsumdever, we can't stand ag?unst him—the pl?ace is his'n, and he can do wot he likes."
<br> 
<br> "Hush—listen!" said Harry.
<br> 
<br> The sound of voices came from the passage outside the kitchen. Reuben was talking to the girl. A word or two reached them.
<br> 
<br> "Durn! if he ?un't getting shut of her!"
<br> 
<br> "I never said as I'd do her work."
<br> 
<br> Harry sprang to his feet, but his mother laid her hand on his arm.
<br> 
<br> "D?an't you go vrothering him, lad. It'll only set him ag?unst you, and I d?an't care, not really; there'll be unaccountable liddle work to do in the house now your poor f?ather's gone, and Blackman w?an't be eating wud us. Besides, as he said, I'll find the days a bit slow wud naun to occupy me."
<br> 
<br> "But it's sass of him to go sending off the girl wudout your leave."
<br> 
<br> "He's m?aster here."
<br> 
<br> "Ho! we shall see that."
<br> 
<br> "Now you're not to go quarrelling wud him, Harry.[Pg 33] I'd sooner have peace than anything whatsumdever. I ?un't used to being set ag?unst people. Besides, it w?an't be fur long."
<br> 
<br> "No—you're justabout right there. I ought to be able to wed Naomi next April year, and then, mother—think of the dear liddle house we shall live in, you and she and I, all wud our own fields and garn, and no trouble, and Ben carrying through his own silly consarns here by himself."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, dearie, I know, and it's unaccountable good of you and Naomi to let me come wud you. I d?an't think we should ought to mind helping your brother a bit here, when we've all that to look forrard to. But he's a strange lad, and your f?ather 'ud turn in his grave to see him."
