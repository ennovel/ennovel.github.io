          </amp-ad><p>Bian Zhuang stood beside the Heavenly River and looked at the Lingxiao Treasure Hall. He was so shocked that he could not say anything.After being in the Heavenly Courts for so long, Bian Zhuang saw the light of the Lingxiao Hall turn dim for the first time. It was the first time that he felt the Heavenly Dao power in the Heavenly Courts become scattered and disorderly.Hundreds of thousands of the Heavenly River Navy gathered on the shore. Bian Zhuang also heard Goddess Nuwa’s orders and recalled his original backer.He wanted to throw off his armor and rush to the Middle Continent. He also thought that there might be a conflict between the Heavenly Courts and the human race. He wanted to rush to the Lingxiao Hall to see the situation.However, he could not.He was now the commander of the Heavenly River Navy. He had to stabilize the morale of the troops here. Like the direct commanders of the various troops of the Heavenly Courts, he could only use his immortal senses to look at the Lingxiao Treasure Hall from afar.Bian Zhuang looked…The God of Fortune had entered. The Lady Mother of the Chariot was so beautiful, but her aura was too terrifying.The Jade Emperor came out. His white robe made him look very dashing. He suddenly called himself a Daoist and joined the Anti-Heaven camp.
</p><p>No, the Heavenly Emperor is rebelling?</p><p>Bian Zhuang was confused. He felt that the world was spinning. A word appeared in his heart.“Ridiculous”.“Marshal!”A low voice sounded from behind. “What are we waiting for! His Majesty has already spoken!”Bian Zhuang frowned and fell silent.The generals said,”Marshal, we are both from the human race. How can we not go when the Goddess summons us?”“Taibai Jinxing has gone to confront the Heavenly Dao to protect the living beings! There’s something wrong with the Heavenly Dao! My Immortal Sect was fine, but it suddenly disappeared the next day! The Middle Continent was so prosperous previously, but it was destroyed by the Heavenly Dao in a few decades!”“I don’t know what major matters of the world are, and I have never experienced the pressure of the Heavenly Dao. Everything has been smooth-sailing. However, the Goddess summoned the Taibai Jinxing and went to the Purple Cloud Palace. Things have definitely reached an irreversible state. I do not know the affairs of the country, but I can make the enemies bleed! If we care about the official position of the Heavenly Courts, wouldn’t we lose the bravery of the human race!?!”Bian Zhuang still refused to speak. He frowned.A Heavenly General cursed, “Marshal, if you are afraid of death, we will resign and do it!”“I’m afraid of death?!”Bian Zhuang widened his eyes and jumped up. His saliva flew everywhere.“If it weren’t because I want to keep you safe, I would have gone there long ago! I rose to power with Lord Taibai Jinxing! My Nine-Toothed Harrow was given to me by the Grand Supreme Elder! Am I not worried? Am I heartless? Look at the hundreds of thousands of brothers! If the few of you lead the way, can they not move forward? All of them are Essence Immortals and Perfected Immortals. They do not even have the cultivation level of a Heaven Immortal. The Anti-Heaven cannot use the Heavenly Dao Battle Formation either. What can we do!?! Court death? Ah!”The generals could not help but be silent. They lowered their heads and did not speak.Bian Zhuang took a deep breath and sighed.“I’m getting worked up. Don’t take it to heart. I won’t stop the Heaven Immortals and Golden Immortals who want to go. The others will wait here. No one is allowed to move without my orders. I’ll look for Commander Ao Yi and ask him what happened.”After saying that, Bian Zhuang was about to turn around and ride a cloud when he heard a dragon roar from the direction of the Lingxiao Hall. An azure dragon soared into the sky and quickly landed in front of Bian Zhuang.It was Ao Yi!Ao Yi shouted, “Where is the Heavenly River Navy!?!”Bian Zhuang immediately walked forward. “They’re all here!”Ao Yi took out a jade tiger talisman from his sleeve.“The Queen Mother has ordered the Heavenly Courts to open the Central Heavenly Gate and let the Goddess of the human race pass! The Heavenly Courts had stopped operations for a day today. The righteous gods of the various tribes do not have official positions! I ordered the Heavenly River Navy to guard the entire way from the Middle Heavenly Gate to the 33 Heavens. They will protect Goddess Nuwa and the heroic spirits!”The generals agreed in unison and turned to look for their generals. Bian Zhuang heaved a sigh of relief.Bian Zhuang was about to say something when Ao Yi blinked at him and sent a voice transmission.Soon, Bian Zhuang jumped into the sky and held his sword.“The Heavenly Dao’s selfish desires have already affected the operation of the Three Realms. The Heavenly Courts are meant to protect the Three Realms and protect the weak. If the heavens are unfair, the Heavenly Courts will not respect their orders! Although the Heavenly Courts were established by the Heavenly Dao to control the Three Realms, However, the immortals and soldiers of the Heavenly Courts are all living beings of the Three Realms! This time, the Heavenly River Navy is escorting the army of the Purple Cloud Palace. If any Heaven Immortals or Golden Immortals want to help, they can join the back! I will definitely go!”The hundreds of thousands of Water Army in the Heavenly River agreed loudly. Their shouts shook the 33 Heavens.It was not just the Heavenly River Navy. The eight righteous gods and the various troops moved together.The Queen Mother sat upright in the Lingxiao Hall. She held the God roll and suppressed the power of the God roll.In the Hall of Enlightenment, the righteous gods who were originally protecting the operation of the Heavenly Courts were now exerting their strength to stop the circulation of the Heavenly Dao power. They also dispersed the Heavenly Dao power and stared at the changes in the Heavenly Dao.In the Divine Punishment Hall, the lightning in the Ten Thousand Lightning Pool had been sealed by layers of immortal power.In fact, the Heavenly Punishment that the Heavenly Dao directly sent had nothing to do with the Ten Thousand Lightning Pool. The immortals and gods of the Heavenly Courts sought peace of mind.“Resistance to the Heavenly Dao.”It was easy to say that, but it was a little heavy for the human immortals in the Heavenly Courts.The Heavenly Courts were established by the Dao Ancestor. It was a supplement to the Heavenly Dao and was in charge of maintaining the operation of the Three Realms. Now, if he denied the Heavenly Dao and became enemies with the Heavenly Dao, it would inevitably make the immortals of the Heavenly Courts feel uneasy.This was actually a calamity for the Heavenly Courts.However, very few people could see the direction of the calamity.The rumbling war drums sounded. Countless starlight had gathered under the Central Heavenly Gate and was darting over.The heroic spirits of the human race—the human soldiers who had died in the ancient battle. Their beliefs were not lost. They relied on the merit of the human emperor’s incense offerings and condensed the will of the human race to protect the human race of the Primordial World.However, the ones with the most number of people were not the heroic spirit army, but the immortals of the human race.Saint Nuwa condensed her 1,000-feet-tall main body into the size of a normal person. She retracted her snake tail and donned her armor. She led tens of thousands of unyielding spirits of the human race to ascend first.The wheels rolled. The hundreds of thousands of human spirits of the Three Emperors and Five Emperors of Fire Cloud Cave followed closely behind.That was the entire foundation of the Fire Cloud Cave.Behind the large number of heroic spirits, there were countless immortals and living beings.The azure dragon circled around. Hundreds of ancient dragons mixed among the immortals. The domineering aura made many immortals unable to circulate their immortal powers.The bugle horn suddenly sounded. A large number of Magi rushed over from the north. They set up the Magi battle formation and stepped on the black clouds, as if they wanted to snatch the position of the vanguard.In the Heavenly Courts, a large number of humans and immortals gathered around the Jade Emperor.They stood in front of the Lingxiao Hall and waited for Goddess Nuwa.At that moment, there were two Saints in the world. The two Saints did not appear directly.However, in the small courtyard of Kunlun Mountain and the straw hut on the spiritual mountain, there was no sign of the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning or Saint Jie Yin.The Saint’s whereabouts were unknown.The first person to enter the Central Heavenly Gate was a lonely figure.It was Ksitigarbha who was in a green robe and was riding Truth Listener.When Ksitigarbha and Truth Listener entered the Central Heavenly Gate, the Queen Mother in the Lingxiao Hall shot out an immortal light. The 33 Heavens suddenly trembled. With the Central Heavenly Gate and the Lingxiao Hall as the middle axis, it split open to the left and right.The Heavenly Road opened up and led to the 33 Heavens!Ksitigarbha closed his eyes and focused. He sat on Truth Listener’s back and quickly rose. When he flew higher, he heard the Jade Emperor’s greeting.“Ksitigarbha, are you willing to go together?”Ksitigarbha opened his eyes and looked at the side of the Heavenly Road. He nodded at the Jade Emperor and rode Truth Listener out of the Heavenly Road and landed in front of the Jade Emperor.Ksitigarbha said, “Your Majesty is righteous.”The Jade Emperor smiled and sighed. He did not say anything.Behind the Jade Emperor, Zhao Gongming untied the red wedding robe and changed into his armor. A wooden sign rose above his head—Saint Slayer Zhao Gongming.The immortal from Jie School, who was holding the wooden sign, looked around smugly.A moment later, streams of light flew up from below. The unyielding spirits of the human race had already landed.Dozens of azure dragons flew to the front and used their powerful bodies to scout the path.The Jade Emperor said, “Let’s help the Goddess of the human race.”After saying that, he took a step forward and led the immortals and gods into the Heavenly Road. They followed behind Goddess Nuwa.There were more streams of light on the Heavenly Road.On the moon, in the Glacial Palace, Heng’e, who was standing in the shadows of the laurel tree, pondered quietly for a while. She whispered something to the woman wearing a rabbit ear accessory behind her.In the Tushita Palace, the Grand Supreme Elder leisurely walked out of the alchemy room. He looked at the green ox in the courtyard who was obediently eating grass and smiled in satisfaction.In the Jade Pool, dozens of fairies with the highest cultivation levels flew out together and rushed towards the Heavenly Road to help.Outside the Heavenly Courts, the old Daoist priest stood under the ginseng fruit tree and sighed softly. He put the scroll into his sleeve and stepped through the universe…In the Purple Cloud Palace.Li Changshou looked at the Dao Ancestor Hong Jun in front of him with a complicated expression. The latter smiled and did not mind the situation.Li Changshou sighed and said, “Fellow Daoist, you really… made lots of people hate you.”“I have a clear conscience.”Hong Jun replied calmly. In the scene behind him, only the faint outline of the figure in the huge cauldron was left.Hong Jun waved his sleeve, and the Cosmic Cauldron trembled slightly. The figure instantly exploded.At that moment, the Heavenly Dao and Hong Jun were extremely closely connected.Hence, Hong Jun’s eyes were even calmer.“From the Heavenly Emperor to the immortals, and the Seven Emotions incarnation of the Earth, they seem to be closely related to you, Fellow Daoist. Fellow Daoist, have you been plotting how to defeat me along the way?”Li Changshou smiled and shook his head. He did not say anything and stared at the Creation Jade Disc that flew back into the Dao Ancestor’s hand.Good stuff…Li Changshou said, “With this treasure, it’s really convenient to control the world.”Hong Jun asked, “Aren’t you going to discuss a countermeasure with them? You can come and go as you please here. I have nothing to prepare for. You are dissatisfied with the Heavenly Dao and me. I will give you this chance. As long as you defeat me today, I will not have any complaints.”Li Changshou was amused. “Fellow Daoist, aren’t you being too much of a bully by saying that you devoured the Heavenly Dao?”“Hehehe.” Hong Jun squinted and smiled, but his eyes were a little sad. “Perhaps, that’s the only fun I have. Changshou, you have not experienced too long…”“I have a Dao companion.”Li Changshou interrupted Hong Jun and extended two fingers. “You have two Dao companions and quite a number of friends.”Hong Jun was speechless.“Forget it.” Hong Jun patted his knees and stood up.Li Changshou stood up at the side and carefully controlled the fake body that was supposed to be a Void Bodhi, making his movements seem more relaxed and casual.Hong Jun asked, “Before they rush over, should we do something?”“Fellow Daoist, feel free.”A faint Dao rune appeared around Li Changshou. His body turned faint as he said calmly, “I come from the void. This body is fake. Only the Dao remains.”The Void Dispelling Great Dao, the Void Fixation technique.Hong Jun raised his hand and pointed. Li Changshou’s body suddenly twisted into a ball like a tablecloth.However, Li Changshou only casually raised his hand and took a step out while twisting. He was safe and sound.The two seemed to casually point and raise their hands, but they contained a rather profound Great Dao.Hong Jun thought for a while and smiled.“Your fake body of Patriarch Bodhi is really not bad. Your comprehension makes me a little jealous.”“Fellow Daoist, you have already integrated the Heavenly Dao. It’s extremely easy for you to seal my fake body somewhere,” Li Changshou said calmly. “However, if you want to kill me, you have to have a way to shatter the Void Dispelling Great Dao.”Hong Jun asked, “Are you testing my control of the Heavenly Dao?”Li Changshou smiled and did not answer. He turned around and walked out of the bamboo hut.Hong Jun smiled and said, “Could it be that you’re going to persuade them to go back?”“I have such plans. Unfortunately…”Li Changshou turned his back to the Dao Ancestor and sighed. “According to your magnanimity, they have already stood up. There’s no turning back. I’ll go with them and enter the Purple Cloud Palace later.”“There’s no need to enter. I will wait outside the palace.”Hong Jun said seriously, “No matter what, they are my last enemy. I will give them enough respect.”Li Changshou waved his hand and took a few steps forward. His body flickered a few times and he left the purple bamboo forest.Hong Jun stared at Li Changshou’s back with confusion in his eyes.He was puzzled.Hong Jun really wanted to ask why Li Changshou was so arrogant as to come and go freely in the Purple Cloud Palace.The will of the Heavenly Dao had been devoured by Hong Jun. Hong Jun was the Dao of the Primordial World!This was no longer the case when Hong Jun fought with the Grand Pure One. He could only rely on the essence of the world to prevent the Grand Pure One from attacking. At that time, Hong Jun, who was a Dao Integration expert, was more or less implicated by the strongest Saint against the Heavenly Dao.However, how could he lose now?Hong Jun really did not expect that.Could it be that Li Changshou had done something to the will of the Heavenly Dao?Hong Jun sat down cross-legged and looked solemn. He began to search carefully and quickly checked all the possibilities that he could think of.He could not find any problems.
</p><p>There’s a 98% chance that it’s a trick?</p><p>Hong Jun fell into deep thought and watched Li Changshou’s figure sitting cross-legged outside the Purple Cloud Palace after he left.Li Changshou’s calmness and confidence did not seem fake…Hong Jun squinted slightly.It did not matter.Today, no one could overturn the sky.
</p><p>Hao Tian has been too affected by the variables. It is time to teach him a lesson.</p><p>…Actually, Li Changshou was more or less depressed.It came too quickly!The various factions of his faction had arrived too quickly!TT Doesn’t the entire army need time? Don’t they shout slogans or give pre-war speeches?They rushed towards the Purple Cloud Palace and went against the Heavenly Dao?He was very touched and understood that everyone wanted to contribute to the world and fight for the freedom of living beings.Of course, it was also possible that they were there to help him. However, there was no evidence for that. He did not think too much about it.However…His main body could not descend directly. He needed his Senior Brother Xuan Du to break through the last barrier.If Eldest Senior Brother delayed the opportunity and they fought, he would not be able to protect everyone on his side by relying on the Space Dispelling Great Dao.The problem was that he could not tell everyone to wait.If the Dao Ancestor saw through that he was only strong on the outside but weak on the inside, he would kill the living beings of the Anti-Heaven camp first. The consequences would be even more severe.However, it was rare for him to have such an opportunity. His chances of winning were 100%.Kun Peng Mystic Realm, the main body.Li Changshou looked at the Primordial Chaos Golden Chalice in front of him. At that moment, all the living beings in the mystic realm were isolated and placed in the Primordial Chaos Golden Chalice to prevent anyone from attacking.Li Changshou waited quietly. The Yin and Yang Qi around him could not wait.He summoned the Golden Chalice in front of him and placed it in his arms. A small head popped out from it. It was Ling’e.Ling’e asked softly, “Senior Brother, why didn’t you go back earlier?”“I pretended to be weak and created an illusion,” Li Changshou said. “I’ll use the spies here to let the Dao Ancestor know that I’ve been here all along and cover up my important activities in the Primordial World. To be safe, I just need to find a stable way to return to the Primordial World in an instant. I can use this method to confuse the Dao Ancestor.”Ling’e blinked and gave her senior brother a thumbs-up.“Is the method to return appropriate?”“There’s no need to worry about the three plans,” Li Changshou said. “I can descend at any time. However, the price is low. What I’m waiting for now is a method that doesn’t require me to pay the price.”“All the best!”Ling’e made an encouraging gesture. Li Changshou smiled and raised his hand. He pressed Ling’e’s head with one finger.Then, he frowned and muttered in his heart, “So fast.”He forced Ling’e back into the Primordial Chaos Golden Chalice and put it in his sleeve.He had to prepare.In the Primordial World, dozens of figures had arrived outside the Purple Cloud Palace and were rushing towards Li Changshou’s back.Li Changshou did not turn around. He just sat there quietly and thought about how to stall for time.The first to arrive were the Jade Emperor and Zhao Gongming, who were dressed in white. The two of them arrived beside Li Changshou. Just as they were about to speak, Li Changshou chuckled.“How have you been?”Zhao Gongming smiled and said, “Brother, you’re really good at hiding.”The Jade Emperor looked at the Purple Cloud Palace with a complicated gaze. He sighed and said, “We still reached this step.”“Your Majesty.” Li Changshou stood up and bowed. “I’m really…”“Ah.” The Jade Emperor waved his hand. “It’s not too late to say that after this battle. Look, who’s here?”Li Changshou turned around and looked at the dark figure behind him.The Goddess sat on the war chariot and smiled gently at Li Changshou. The golden armor on her body emitted a rich Saint Dao runes.Clearly, the Torch Flame of the human race had not only allowed the Goddess to recover her strength in a thousand years, but it had also allowed the Goddess to improve.Li Changshou lowered his head and bowed.“Li Changshou of the human race greets the Goddess!”“Changshou, it’s been hard on you,” the Goddess said. “Today, you should fight with all your might. Don’t care about the outcome. This is your last hope.”“Don’t be anxious, Goddess. I have my ways…”Suddenly, he heard a shout of surprise. “Uncle Chang’an!”Li Changshou turned around and saw Nezha and Yang Jian walking over together. Sun Wukong was standing a little distance away with a frown. His body was bound by layers of immortal ropes.Li Changshou gestured for them not to move forward.“Lord Taibai Jinxing!”A Heavenly General shouted loudly. Hundreds of Heavenly Generals who had taken off their helmets lowered their heads and cupped their fists.“Greetings, Lord Taibai Jinxing.”Behind the Heavenly General, the human cultivators bowed. The righteous gods of the Heavenly Courts who had followed the Jade Emperor bowed at the same time.After that, the heroic spirits looked over.“Everyone, you’re too polite!”Li Changshou raised his hand and supported himself.“Seniors! Fellow Daoists! The Heavenly Dao was unwell. The Dao Ancestor’s personal desire to invade the Heavenly Dao relied on his own selfishness to determine the fate of living beings and the evolution of the world! The living beings seemed to be imprisoned in the world. The will of the heavens was like a blade, and it became more and more restrained! Today, I will carry out the act of conquering the heavens. I want to ask the Dao Ancestor to abdicate and let the world be free. I want to return all living beings to the world!”The Heavenly Generals, spirits, and living beings of Heaven and Earth that rushed out of the Heavenly Road, all gathered and ignited their fighting spirits.At this moment!The seven-colored light enveloped the Purple Cloud Palace, which was surrounded by the Chaos aura. Large amounts of dark clouds appeared.The White-Robed Jade Emperor took a few steps forward when he saw that. He held the sun, moon, and universe in his palm and stepped on the shadows of the stars. Green and blue lightning flashed in his eyes.Large batches of dark clouds condensed above the White-Robed Jade Emperor’s head and collided with the dark clouds floating over the Purple Cloud Palace.The two of them merged halfway. Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled inside. They did not give in to each other!In the Lingxiao Hall of the Heavenly Courts, the Queen Mother closed her eyes and focused. She used her mystical ability to observe this scene in her heart. She patted the God roll, and the circulation of the Heavenly Dao power almost completely froze.“Dao Ancestor!”The white-robed Jade Emperor’s long hair danced in the wind. He shouted, “I’m not convinced!”“Dao Ancestor,” Ksitigarbha rode Truth Listener forward and said slowly, “Can the illness of the world be a threat to living beings?”Zhao Gongming and the Goddess of Golden Spirit walked forward. Zhao Gongming shouted, “Grandmaster, today, I’m bold enough to seek you to take revenge for Master.”The divine eye on Yang Jian’s forehead shone brightly, as if it wanted to see through the Purple Cloud Palace. He shouted firmly, “What is righteous? What is righteous, and what is heaven?”“Hong Jun!”Dozens of rough and old voices combined into a roar. It was a group of dragon experts rushing to the left!“There should be an outcome for the blood feud of the ancient battle today. The dragon race has been harmed by you and has been trapped in the Sea Eye until today! The ancient battle soul is not destroyed. We must seek justice!”“Teacher.” Although the Goddess of Nuwa’s voice was soft, it contained a certain soul-stirring power. “What is wrong with living beings? Why are there endless calamities from ancient times? Why does the Primordial World have to be shattered?”“Amitabha!”A Buddhist proclamation suddenly floated over.The Chaos aura in the distance surged, and a huge hole was opened in the universe. Golden light shone out of the hole, and a huge Buddha flew out. His eyes were half-closed, and he looked dignified.Buddha Duobao said slowly, “Dao Ancestor, may I ask why the teachings of the Buddhist Sect have to teach people to tolerate, teach people to follow the heavens, and teach people to believe in their own destiny? Why not? We should do our best to seize a chance of survival.”“I’m also a little puzzled.”A gray-haired old Daoist priest in a black robe walked over from the void. His wide sleeves hung down and immortal light lingered. He was the Essence-Suppressing Immortal.“Back then, the Dao Ancestor preached thrice in the Purple Cloud Palace. He said that the world would be stable and that living beings would live in the five continents and the trichiliocosm. However, why is it that today, the Purple Cloud Palace is getting higher and higher, and the Three Realms are getting smaller and smaller, more living beings are getting defeated and friends are so hard to find?”“Dao Ancestor!”Behind the army of spirits, a thin old female Magi shouted with great effort, “Has the Dao Ancestor personally schemed against us, the Magi, to the end of our lives!?! The Lady of Earth was schemed against by you and turned into the Six Paths of Reincarnation Disc. He will never be free!”“Ah, this is just the victim who survived.”A sigh came from the corner of the spirit army. The young Daoist in a red robe stood behind the Daoist with a plain appearance and said guiltily, “Since ancient times, I wonder how many grievances those living beings who can’t speak have.”Perfected Taiyi and Perfected Yu Ding.Buzz…Violent Dao runes appeared in the Purple Cloud Palace.Perfected Taiyi shrank his neck and glared at Perfected Yu Ding.
</p><p>I didn’t sound sarcastic. Why did the Dao Ancestor attack him?</p><p>Thousands of rays of light shone in front of the Purple Cloud Palace. The burly old Daoist priest appeared in the middle of the light. He was dressed in a grayish-white robe and sat cross-legged on the lotus platform.The old Daoist priest only opened his eyes halfway. The extremely rich power of the Heavenly Dao covered the aura of the living beings there.Dao Ancestor, Hong Jun.Fury burned in the eyes of many living beings. There was only determination in the eyes of Goddess Nuwa.Li Changshou took half a step forward and appeared in front of everyone, leaving his back to them.He had to control the rhythm of the entire scene. Only then could he seize the opportunity to control his main body.Li Changshou sighed softly.“What everyone doesn’t know is that the Dao Ancestor has not only arranged these. Ever since the Primordial Chaos was established and the world was created, the Dao Ancestor has woven a huge net and manipulated the world. He had once conspired with the Fiend Ancestor to bury the entire ancient times. He deliberately instigated and secretly used methods. He did not hesitate to let the ancient Primordial World shatter and stimulate the final will of the Pangu God to protect the world. He evolved it into the will of the Heavenly Dao so that it would be devoured by him at that moment and let him fuse with the world. The ancient demons are just pawns in his hands. The mighty figures of the various factions are just his leverage. Everything was going according to his script. He did not allow any resistance or strange sounds. He said that he is protecting the world.”Hong Jun sighed and said, “Everything I do is for the world.”“I’ll save some dignity for you. I won’t say anything else.”At that moment, Li Changshou had already walked between the living beings and the Dao Ancestor. He deliberately blocked the living beings behind him.“At this moment, the Heavenly Dao only has the Dao Ancestor’s will. In the future, the world would only be flipped in the Dao Ancestor’s palm. Dao Ancestor, I’ll ask you one last time. Can you return the world to living beings? Can you release the restrictions on living beings? Can you apologize to the Primordial World?”Hong Jun looked at Li Changshou expressionlessly and raised his right hand to tap the universe beside him.Layers of treasure wheels appeared behind him. There were a total of 36 rings.The treasure wheel shone slightly and circular doors appeared everywhere in the void. Countless gray-robed old Daoists walked out.In an instant, rich pressure spread out from the old Daoists.Just the combined forces of the old Daoists alone had completely suppressed the power of all living beings in the place.That was Hong Jun’s reply.Many living beings turned pale, and anger burned in their eyes.Hong Jun seemed unwilling to say anything else. He raised his left hand and was about to give the order to exterminate the living beings there.Moo ~With a cow’s cry, the green ox carried Grand Supreme Elder and came from the void. It made Hong Jun hesitate.“Teacher.”A voice called out from behind the green ox. The middle-aged scholar walked over with his hands behind his back and stared at Hong Jun’s figure.Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning!“There are so many living beings. If you kill them directly, the power of the living beings in the world will probably hit rock bottom. Since you can modify the memories of all living beings, why don’t you do that? It can be considered as leaving more thoughts for the Primordial World.”Hong Jun said calmly, “Are you going to attack?”The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning looked at Li Changshou and smiled. “Changgeng, what are your chances of winning today?”“100%.”Li Changshou said firmly, “I’m 100% confident of winning.”“Oh?” The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning frowned slightly.“Uncle-Master, you don’t have to do anything today. I’ll do it.”Li Changshou took a deep breath. His body quickly dissolved and turned into a layer of fog that rose and wrapped the living beings in the place with a layer of Dao runes.The Dao of emptiness entered the void.Li Changshou spoke up unrestrainedly on the spot.“I only said so much to stall for time. Listen.”Hong Jun looked up towards the southeast.That was where Xuandu City used to be!Boom!The Purple Cloud Palace shone brightly. Immortal light surged around many gray-robed old Daoists. The entire void seemed to be trembling. The chains that were connected to the Purple Cloud Palace were trembling violently.It was as if something huge had crashed into the Primordial World!At the legacy site of Xuandu City,a wisp of five-colored tail slowly dissipated in the void of the Chaos Sea.The Kun Peng, which was extremely huge, had already crashed through the barrier of the world. Half of its body had fallen into the Primordial World!On the head of the Kun Peng, Great Daoist Master Xuan Du stood proudly. His wide robe and long hair fluttered wildly. He raised his hands and held the Taiji Painting vertically!“Open!”The Great Daoist Master shouted and the Yin-Yang Twin Fish of the Taiji Painting cracked!Behind him, the shadows of the Taiji Painting opened the door in his wake!Flowing light flickered in the Chaos Sea!That was the ultimate escape technique!The figure that was activating the escape technique crashed into the Cosmic Gates that were opened in the Chaos Sea. It was wrapped in Yin and Yang Qi. In an instant, it completed hundreds of jumps and appeared beside the Great Daoist Master!He was dressed in a green robe and had a Dao hairpin that ran through his long hair.Who else could it be but Li Changshou!?!“I’ll leave it to you.” Great Daoist Master Xuan Du chuckled and handed the Taiji Painting to Li Changshou.“Thank you, Senior Brother.” Li Changshou held the Taiji Painting and looked ahead. “Senior Brother, come and meet everyone later. I’ll go and quell the Heavenly Dao’s selfish desires.”Before the Great Daoist Master could complain, Li Changshou took another step forward.He raised his hand and cut open the Yin and Yang. He condensed the world in front of him into a single step. It was as if the thickness of the Primordial World had turned into a mirror frame. It entered the frame from outside the frame!Li Changshou’s figure appeared in front of the Purple Cloud Palace from the edge of the trichiliocosm!It was stable, natural, and did not feel out of place.Li Changshou looked up at Hong Jun and smiled faintly.“Fellow Daoist, the auspicious hour has arrived.”…The area in front of the Purple Cloud Palace became completely quiet.Everyone stared at Li Changshou’s back as that was all that they could do.At that moment, Li Changshou was emitting a Dao rune from head to toe. His confidence made them stunned, just like the Dao Ancestor.Li Changshou did not hide it anymore. He sent the Primordial Chaos Golden Chalice back to Zhao Gongming’s side and figures flew out.Without looking back, Li Changshou began to walk forward step by step. His words spread everywhere.“The problem is never about fighting. When I wrote the word ‘Heavenly Dao’ into the Great Dao of Equalization, I had already come to this realization. The Dao Ancestor is not a Saint of the Primordial Chaos Limitless Great Dao. How can he defeat his teacher and his two Uncle-Masters in this world? The problem is that the Dao Ancestor had succeeded in the Dao Integration. He had used the Heavenly Dao to imprison the world and originate from himself. If he wanted to destroy the Dao Ancestor, he had to drag the Primordial World down with him. The problem lies in the Dao Ancestor’s Dao Integration with the Heavenly Dao.”“Oh?” Hong Jun looked at Li Changshou. A huge cauldron appeared behind him.Li Changshou did not even look at it and continued, “This world is the blood of the Pangu God. It is the place where living beings live. No one can decide if the world is destroyed. I have to think about how I can strip the Dao Ancestor from the essence of the world.In the beginning, I took the wrong path and kept thinking about how to separate the Heavenly Dao from the Dao Ancestor. However, as I began to come into contact with the deeper levels of the Heavenly Dao, I realized that it was nonsense. The Heavenly Dao is the Dao Ancestor’s decision. It has already become the Dao Ancestor’s Dharma artifact. However, the Heavenly Dao is not a necessity for the Primordial World. It is essentially a feedback mechanism.”Hong Jun raised his hand and pointed. Boundless purple-black lightning struck Li Changshou.He seemed to be just testing him, and Li Changshou’s response was even simpler.The Mysterious Yellow Pagoda floated above his head. The Taiji Painting casually covered it and swept the lightning down.Hong Jun said calmly, “So, you found a way?”“That’s right. I found it.”Li Changshou smiled and said, “I asked myself many times what the Heavenly Dao is. The concept is very vague and abstract. Firstly, the Heavenly Dao began with the belief that the Pangu God protected the world. This belief resonated with the three thousand Great Dao that constituted the Primordial Dao Law Sea. Only then did the Heavenly Dao appear. Three thousand is an estimate. The Heavenly Dao is a web that was interwoven by the Great Dao. It is the deduction of the Great Dao and the management authority approved by the Great Dao. The Creation Jade Disc cannot control the Great Dao. The Creation Jade Disc can only record the Great Dao and assist in comprehending the Great Dao. Due to the conflict between the Great Dao and the Great Dao, Fellow Daoist could not perfect most Great Dao. This is my chance.”As he spoke, Li Changshou raised his hand and pressed it down. A little fog appeared around him, and three figures that were identical to him appeared behind him.Mystical Ability: Three Pure OnesThe three clones each held the Chaos Bell, the Taiji Painting, and the God-Slaying Spear respectively. They stood behind Li Changshou and looked at the Dao Ancestor. They spoke together and their voices were perfect.“The Heavenly Dao is not irreversible.”Hong Jun smiled and said calmly, “Relying on your Art of Equalization?”“Part of it,” Li Changshou said. “Fellow Daoist, aren’t you going to stop me now?”Hong Jun raised his hand and pushed gently. The huge cauldron behind him turned forward.Suddenly, the sound of a flute sounded beside him. Hong Jun frowned slightly. His Dao heart was filled with distracting thoughts. He looked at the young girl playing the flute from the corner of his eyes.Seven emotions!That was not all.In the Six Paths of Reincarnation Disc, the gentle woman kneeling by the river formed seals with her hands. The Six Paths of Reincarnation Disc trembled without any warning. The power of the Heavenly Dao clearly stopped!In fact, the Dao Ancestor’s movements slowed down slightly.The experts behind Li Changshou almost instantly captured the “opportunity”!That was an opportunity that could not be missed!The Chaos Bell avatar in Li Changshou’s hand suddenly turned around and aimed its palm at the Goddess Nuwa in the distance. He had already used the Great Dao of Equalization!Balance: Dao Realm!Bang!The Chaos Bell suddenly sounded. Li Changshou suddenly sped up, and a series of voices became a soft tapping sound.The huge cauldron in front of Hong Jun was about to hit Li Changshou!However, at that moment, Li Changshou, who had borrowed the Dao Realm of the Saint and used the power of the Chaos Bell to accelerate the flow of time in his body, moved faster than his limit!His main body used the Great Dao of Equalization.The three clones used the Great Dao of Equalization!A speck of gold bloomed on Li Changshou’s forehead. In the blink of an eye, it engulfed the entire Purple Cloud Palace.In Li Changshou’s eyes, the Dao Ancestor and the gray-robed old Daoists who were about to attack together were as slow as snails!The Dao Ancestor naturally had a way to accelerate time. Li Changshou was fighting a time difference!The Chaos Bell could suppress him. At the crucial moment, he could retreat for an instant. Unless the Dao Ancestor struck the Chaos Bell first, he could not stop him.The process of hitting the Chaos Bell was enough for Li Changshou.He had verified it countless times and was sure that he could complete all his arrangements!“I said that the Great Dao has no upper or lower. It should be balanced.”“I said that living beings cultivate the Great Dao and have their own spirituality.”“I said that life and death are separated. Dao marks exist forever.”Equalization, Dao and Dao!Balance, Dao and Spirit!Balance, life and death!“I will sacrifice my Art of Equalization! I will never enter the Saint realm!”As he sped up, Li Changshou shouted. The four balance poles behind his main body and avatar transformed into golden light. They first surged behind Li Changshou and bloomed on his forehead!Under the protection of the Chaos Bell, this process did not even seem like an instant to outsiders!The golden light swept everywhere. It was mysterious and obscure. He did not know why.Li Changshou slapped the void and a golden desk appeared in front of him. As the desk appeared, a magnificent golden hall quickly condensed and isolated the Dao Ancestor and all living beings!That was his plan to deal with the Dao Ancestor!Only in the Purple Cloud Palace, the Purple Cloud Palace, which had gathered three thousand Great Dao, could the plan be successfully implemented at the beginning of the power of the Heavenly Dao—Purple Cloud Palace!Li Changshou summoned a jade brush and waved it in the air. He wrote words.In various parts of the hall, three thousand Great Dao appeared one after another. They were like light rays and formless.Almost two-thirds of the Great Dao projection flickered with three to five weak points of light.Illusory Spirit Nail!Li Changshou’s left hand shone with starlight as he inserted thousands of Illusionary Spirits Nails into the Great Dao that he had not found a chance to sow previously!The Great Dao was everywhere, but the power of the Great Dao was not distributed evenly everywhere.Only the Purple Cloud Palace was the only place where one could find all three thousand Great Dao!The three thousand Great Dao were triggered by the Great Dao of Equalization that Li Changshou had activated. All of them disappeared!The words that Li Changshou had written turned into a bell sound, causing the insubstantial Great Dao to tremble.“Firstly, this place was formed by the Great Dao of Equalization. It can only be activated at the same time as the Chaos Bell and the Taiji Painting. Moreover, it can only be discovered by the guardian of this hall. There are no living beings in the Great Dao of Equalization.”“Secondly, if there were any living beings who had perfect control of each Great Dao, they would use the living beings as the foundation and use the remnant Dao marks in the Great Dao to deduce their projections. They would be imprisoned in this hall and become the Dao Spirits of this place.”“Thirdly, if there are no cultivators in a Great Dao, it will be classified as the Dao of Silence. If there are no living beings who have mastered this Great Dao, it will be projected using the Dao marks of the living beings who have walked the farthest in this Dao!”“Fourthly, this place does not enter the five elements of the Three Realms, the Primordial World, the physical world, or the sea of Dao laws.”“Fifth, the living beings here are projected to be where the living beings resonate with the Great Dao. If the living beings survive and enter with the Dao, they cannot have selfish desires. They are allowed to store memories related to this place to warn the living beings.”…“No. 32: The Dao Marks left behind by the living beings of the various Dao cannot contain any spiritual will.”“No. 33: Apart from the Guardians Here, no living beings are allowed to enter.”“No. 34: The Great Dao is Abandoned by the living beings who interfere with the operation of this place.”“No. 35: The Great Dao that interfered with the operation of this place shattered.”“No. 36: Dao Ancestor Hong Jun cannot come into contact with the Heavenly Dao’s will.”…]Li Changshou waved his brush and a “rule” that he had long prepared quickly condensed. Every word was embedded in the hall and turned into mysterious Dao patterns.Finally!Li Changshou took a deep breath and put down his brush.“Today, I will establish the Court of Dao with the Great Dao of Equalization! Three thousand Great Dao, appear quickly!”Buzz…Immortal light flashed in the Golden Light Hall. Figures appeared out of thin air and stood on their respective lotus platforms. The lotus platforms were all different.Only a small half of the phantoms there had various expressions. They were naturally living beings who could represent the Great Dao.The crucial 0.2!Most of the phantoms were expressionless. They bowed to Li Changshou.Isn’t the old man standing on the lotus platform surrounded by black flames Suiren?He looked at the headless corpse on the lotus platform that was surrounded by yellow soil light. It was the Grand Magus, Xing Tian!The mighty azure dragons that had shrunk countless times were the afterimages left behind by the Ancestral Dragon and the experts of the dragon race. They occupied many seats.The middle-aged scholar wrapped in golden flames seemed to be the handsome ancient demon emperor.The old man in the red robe happened to be the good old Hong Yun.The twelve Ancestral Magi looked strange and ferocious. The Lady of Earth was among them.He looked at the ten marshals of the Demon Court. They were all majestic, but like the witches, most of them were only left with projections.The deceased only had afterimages.The expressions of the experts who were still alive were not very rich.There were naturally many familiar faces. Most of them were experts from the Primordial World who could see and sense the situation.The Great Daoist Master, Yun Xiao, Zhao Gongming, his two aunts, the Goddess of Wudang, the Jade Emperor, the Queen Mother… and Ling’e, who had relied on her Dao to be too strange…Wait, wait, wait.The six Saints were also there.Only Daoist Zhun Ti, who had already died, had a cold expression. The other five Saints had different expressions. The expression of the Saint who led them was the most complicated.In the corner, there was even the figure of Dao Ancestor Hong Jun.To be safe, Dao Ancestor Hong Jun was directly isolated by the rules that Li Changshou had set. The shadow here was only formed by the mark that Hong Jun had left on his Great Dao when he was cultivating.The Illusionary Spirit Nail was originally a simple Dharma artifact. Its use was to make Illusionary Spirit Shadows appear from dead objects.The Great Dao of Equalization was originally meant to balance all living beings. However, Li Changshou had used the Three Pure Ones four times at the same time to construct this place.Li Changshou did not hesitate at all. At that moment, he patted the desk.“The Dao Ancestor is Daoless. The Heavenly Dao is unbalanced. In the name of the first guardian of the Court of Dao, I propose to reconstruct the Heavenly Dao! With the authority of a Guardian, I will immediately execute it if there is no objection from more than 70% of the Great Dao! Who objects?”</p> </div> </div> <div class="row turn-page"> <a class="col-xs-2" href="/My%20Senior%20Brother%20is%20Too%20Steady/757.html?v=1662298177531">Previous</a> <a class="col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:center;" href="/My%20Senior%20Brother%20is%20Too%20Steady/book.html?v=1662298177526">Table</a> <a class="col-xs-2 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:right;" href="/My%20Senior%20Brother%20is%20Too%20Steady/759.html?v=1662298177533"> Next</a> </div> <hr></div><hr><footer class="container"> <p>© Company 2014</p></footer><amp-lightbox id="searchLightbox" class="-il" layout="nodisplay" on="lightboxOpen:searchInput.focus; lightboxClose:searchTriggerOpen.focus" scrollable="" hidden="hidden"> <div> <div class="-ic" role="button" tabindex="0" on="tap:searchLightbox.close"></div> <div class="-ih"> <div class="-sg -sb" on="tap: searchLightbox.close, AMP.setState({ query: '' }), searchForm.clear" role="button" tabindex="0"> <div class="ap-a-ico -sw"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#close"></use> </svg> </div> </div> <div class="ap-o-search-field"> <form action="#" action-xhr="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/echo" class="-ip" id="searchForm" on="submit:AMP.setState({ query: throttledValue }),searchResult.focus" target="_top"> <amp-autocomplete class="-id" filter="substring" min-characters="1" on="select:AMP.setState({ query: event.value })" submit-on-enter="false" src="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/autosuggest"> <div class="ap-a-ico -im"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#search"></use> </svg> </div> <input id="searchInput" class="-iv" name="q" placeholder="What are you looking for?" on="input-throttled:AMP.setState({ throttledValue: event.value })" required=""> <button class="-ig" type="submit" name="search-submit" disabled="" [disabled]="!throttledValue">Search </button> <div role="listbox"></div> </amp-autocomplete> </form> <div class="empty" [class]="query ?
