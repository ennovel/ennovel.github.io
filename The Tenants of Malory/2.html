All that the Draper’s Wife Could Tell.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      THIS street, in a few hundred steps emerging from the little town, changes its character into that of a narrow rural road, overhung by noble timber, and descending with a gentle curve toward the melancholy woods of Malory.
<br> 
<br> “How beautifully she walks, too! By Jove, she’s the loveliest being I ever beheld. She’s the most perfectly beautiful girl in England. How I wish some d — d fellow would insult her, that I might smash him, and have an excuse for attending her home.”
<br> 
<br> So spoke enthusiastic Tom Sedley, as they paused to watch the retreat of the ladies, leaning over the dwarf stone wall, and half hidden by the furrowed stem of a gigantic ash tree.
<br> 
<br> From this point, about a quarter of a mile distant from Malory, they saw them enter the wide iron gate and disappear in the dark avenue that leads up to that sombre place.
<br> 
<br> “There! I said it was Malory,” exclaimed Sedley, laying his hand briskly on Cleve’s arm.
<br> 
<br> “Well, I hope you’re pleased; and tell me, now, what stay do you make at Cardyllian, Tom? Can you come over to Ware — not tomorrow, for I’m not quite sure that I shall be there, but on Tuesday, for a day or two?”
<br> 
<br> No — Tom Sedley couldn’t. He must leave tomorrow, or, at latest, on Tuesday morning; and, for today, he had promised to go to afternoon service with the Etherges, and then home to tea with them. He was to meet the party on the Green.
<br> 
<br> So after a little talk, they turned together toward the town; and they parted near the Verney Arms, where Cleve’s dog-cart awaited him. Having given his order in the hall, he walked into the coffee-room, in which, seated demurely, and quite alone, he found stout Mrs. Jones, the draper’s wife — suave, sedate, wearing a subdued Sabbath smile upon her broad and somewhat sly countenance.
<br> 
<br> Her smile expanded as Cleve drew near. She made a great and gracious courtesy, and extended her short fat hand, which Cleve Verney took and shook — for the tradition of homelier, if not kindlier times, still lingered in Cardyllian, and there were friendly personal relations between the great family and the dozen and a half of shop-keepers who constituted its commercial strength.
<br> 
<br> So Cleve Verney joked and talked with her, leaning on the back of a chair, with one knee on the seat of it. He was pleased to have lighted upon such a gossip, as good Mrs. Jones, the draper, who was waiting for the return of her husband, who was saying a word to Mr. Watkyn Hughes, in the bar, about a loan of his black horse for a funeral next morning.
<br> 
<br> “So it seems Lady Verney has got a tenant in Malory?” he said at last.
<br> 
<br> “Yes, indeed, sir,” she replied, in her most confidential manner; “and I hope— I do indeed— it may turn out such a thing as she would like.”
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Jones usually spoke in low and significant tones, and with a mystery and caution worthy of deeper things than she often talked about.
<br> 
<br> “Why, is there anything odd?” asked the young gentleman curiously.
<br> 
<br> “Well, it is not, now, altogether what I would wish for Lady Verney. I haven’t seen any of the Malory family, excepting in church today; not one, indeed, sir; they are very strange; they never come into the town — not once since ever they came to Malory! but dear me! you know, sir, that might be, and yet everything as we could wish, mightn’t it; yes, sure; still, you know, people will be talking; it’s a pity we don’t mind our own business more, and let others be, isn’t it, sir?”
<br> 
<br> “Great pity; but — but what’s the matter?” urged Cleve Verney.
<br> 
<br> “Well, Master Cleve, you know, Cardyllian, and how we do talk here; I don’t say more than other places, but we do, and I do not like repeatin’ everything I hear. There’s more mischief than good, I think, comes of repeatin’ stories.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh! come, pray what’s the good of a story except to repeat it? I ought to know, perhaps I should tell Lady Verney about it,” said Cleve, who was really curious, for nothing could be more quiet than the get up and demeanour of the ladies.
<br> 
<br> “They haven’t been here, you know, very long,” murmured Mrs. Jones, earnestly.
<br> 
<br> “No, I don’t know. I know nothing about it; how long?”
<br> 
<br> “Well, about five weeks — a little more; and we never saw the gentleman once; he’s never been down to the town since he came; never indeed, sir, not once.”
<br> 
<br> “He shows his sense; doesn’t he?”
<br> 
<br> “Ah, you were always pleasant, Master Cleve, but you don’t think so; no, you don’t indeed; his conduct is really most singular, he’s never been outside the walls of Malory all that time, in the daylight; very odd; he has hired Christmass Owen’s boat, and he goes out in it every night, unless twice, the wind was too high, and Owen didn’t choose to venture his boat. He’s a tall man, Christmass Owen says, and holds himself straight, like an officer, for people will be making inquiries, you know; and he has gray hair; not quite white, you know.”
<br> 
<br> “How should I know?”
<br> 
<br> “Ah, ha, you were always funny; yes, indeed, but it is gray, gone quite gray, Christmass Owen says.”
<br> 
<br> “Well, and what about the ladies?” inquired the young gentleman. “They’re not gone gray, all? though I shouldn’t wonder much, in Malory.”
<br> 
<br> “The ladies? Well. There’s two, you know; there’s Miss Sheckleton, that’s the elderly lady, and all the Malory accounts in the town is opened in her name. Anne Sheckleton, very reg’lar she is. I have nothing to say concerning her. They don’t spend a great deal, you understand, but their money is sure.”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, of course; but, you said, didn’t you? that there was something not quite right about them.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh dear, no, sir; I did not say quite that; nothing wrong, no sure, but very odd, sir, and most unpleasant, and that is all.”
<br> 
<br> “And that’s a good deal; isn’t it?” urged Cleve.
<br> 
<br> “Well, it is something; it is indeed a great deal,” Mrs. Jones emphasised oracularly.
<br> 
<br> “And what is it, what do you know of them, or the people here what do they say?”
<br> 
<br> “Well, they say, putting this and that together, and some hints from the servant that comes down to order things up from the town — for servants, you know, will be talking — that the family is mad.”
<br> 
<br> “Mad!” echoed Cleve.
<br> 
<br> “That’s what they say.”
<br> 
<br> “The whole family are mad! and yet continue to manage their affairs as they do! By Jove, it is a comfort to find that people can get on without heads, on emergency.”
<br> 
<br> “They don’t say, no, dear me! that all that’s in the house are mad; only the old man and the young lady.”
<br> 
<br> “And what is she mad upon?”
<br> 
<br> “Well, they don’t say. I don’t know — melancholy I do suppose.”
<br> 
<br> “And what is the old gentleman’s name?”
<br> 
<br> “We don’t know, the servants don’t know, they say; they were hired by Miss Sheckleton, in Chester, and never saw the old gentleman, nor the young lady, till after they were two or three days in Malory; and one night comes a carriage, with a madhouse gentleman, they do say, a doctor, in charge of the old gentleman, and the young lady, poor thing! and so they were handed over by him, to Miss Sheckleton.”
<br> 
<br> “And what sort of lunacies do they commit? They’re not pulling down the house among them, I hope?”
<br> 
<br> “Very gentle — very. I’m told, quite, as you may say, manageable. It’s a very sad thing, sir, but what a world it is! yes, indeed. Isn’t it?”
<br> 
<br> “Ay, so it is. — I’ve heard that, I think, before.”
<br> 
<br> “You may have heard it from me, sir, and it’s long been my feeling and opinion, dear me! The longer I live the more melancholy sights I see!”
<br> 
<br> “How long is Malory let for?”
<br> 
<br> “Can’t say, indeed, sir. That is they may give it up every three months, but has the right to keep it two whole years, that is if they like, you understand.”
<br> 
<br> “Well, it is rather odd. It was they who sat in the Malory seat today?”
<br> 
<br> “That was Miss Sheckleton, was the old lady; and the young one, didn’t you think her very pretty, sir?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes — she’s pretty,” he answered carelessly. “But I really could not see very well.”
<br> 
<br> “I was very near as she turned to leave — before she took down her veil — and I thought what a really beautiful creature she was!”
<br> 
<br> “And what do they call her?”
<br> 
<br> “Miss Margaret, sir.”
<br> 
<br> “Margaret! a pretty name — rather. Oh! here’s Mr. Jones;” and Mr. Jones was greeted — and talked a little — somewhat more distantly and formally than his goodwife had done — and Mr. and Mrs. Jones, with a dutiful farewell, set off upon their Sunday’s ramble.
