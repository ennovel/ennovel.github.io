He approached me one morning after practice.</p> 
<p>"We want you to room with Bloomberg," he said.</p> 
<p>"Why me?"</p> 
<p>"John Billy Small was in there with him. Couldn't take the tension. We figure you won't mind. You're more the complicated type."</p> 
<p>"Of course I'll mind."</p> 
<p>"John Billy said he wets the bed. Aside from that there's no problem. He gets nervous. No doubt about that. A lot of tension in that frame. But we figure you can cope with it."</p> 
<p>"I object. I really do. I've got my own tensions."</p> 
<p>"Harkness, everybody knows what kind of reputation you brought down here. Coach is willing to take a chance on you only as long as you follow orders. So keep in line. Just keep in line—hear?"</p> 
<p>"Who's rooming with Taft Robinson?" I said.</p> 
<p>"Robinson rooms alone."</p> 
<p>"Why's that?"</p> 
<p>"You'll have to ask the powers that be. In the meantime move your stuff in with Bloomberg."</p> 
<p>"I don't like tension," I said. "And I don't see why I have to be the one who gets put in with controversial people."</p> 
<p>"It's for the good of the team," Hauptfuhrer said.</p> 
<p>Five of us sneaked into the nearest town that night, a place called Rooster, to see what was happening. We ended up at Bing Jackmin's house, right outside town, where we drank beer for five hours. Bing's father joined us, falling off the porch when he came out to say good night. We drove back to campus and held a drunken Olympiad in the moonlight at the edge of the football field—slowmotion races, grass swimming, spitting for distance. Then we walked slowly back to the dorm and listened to Norgene Azamanian tell the story of his name.</p> 
<p>"A lot of people take it for a girl's name. But it's no such thing. It comes from Norge refrigerators and from my uncle, Captain Gene Kinney. How it all came about, my being called Norgene, makes for a real interesting story. You see, everybody in my mother's family going back for generations, man or woman, always had a Christian name of just one syllable. Nobody knows how it started but at some point along the line they decided they'd keep it going. So I go and get born and it comes time to name me. Now it just so happens there was an old Norge refrigerator out on the back porch waiting to get thrown away. It also happens that my daddy wasn't too happy about the syllable thing, it being his belief that the bible carries a warning against onesyllable names, Cain being his brother's slayer. And finally there was the amazing coincidence that my uncle Gene Kinney was on leave and coming over to visit so he could see the new baby, which was me, and so he could get in on the naming of it to be sure the family tradition would be carried out. How all these different factors resulted in the name Norgene is the whole crux of the story."</p> 
<p>"Very good," Bing said. "But first tell us how you got Azamanian."</p> 
<p>I went up to my room. Bloomberg was asleep, on his belly, snoring softly into the pillow. He was absolutely enormous. It was easy to imagine him attached to the bed by guywires, to be floated aloft once a year like a Macy's balloon. His full name was Anatole Bloomberg and he played left tackle on offense. That was all I knew about him, that plus the fact that he wasn't a Texan. One of the outcasts, I thought. Or a voluntary exile of the philosophic type. I decided to wake him up.</p> 
<p>"Anatole," I said. "It's Gary Harkness, your new roommate. Let's shake hands and be friends."</p> 
<p>"We're roommates," he said. "Why do we have to be friends?"</p> 
<p>"It's just an expression. I didn't mean undying comrades. Just friends as opposed to enemies. I'm sorry I woke you up."</p> 
<p>"I wasn't asleep."</p> 
<p>"You were snoring," I said.</p> 
<p>"That's the way I breathe when I'm on my stomach What happened to my original roommate?"</p> 
<p>"John Billy? John Billy's been moved."</p> 
<p>"Was that his name?"</p> 
<p>"He's been moved. I hope you're not tense about my showing up. All I want to do is get off to a good start and avoid all possible tension."</p> 
<p>"Who in your opinion was the greater man?" Bloomberg said. "Edward Gibbon or Archimedes?"</p> 
<p>"Archimedes."</p> 
<p>"Correct,"he said.</p> 
<p>In the morning Creed sent us into an allout scrimmage with a brief inspirational message that summed up everything we knew or had to know.</p> 
<p>"It's only a game," he said, "but it's the only game."</p> 
<p>Taft Robinson and I were the setbacks. Taft caught a flare pass, evaded two men and went racing down the sideline, Bobby Iselin, a cornerback, gave up the chase at the 25. Bobby used to be the team's fastest man.</p>
