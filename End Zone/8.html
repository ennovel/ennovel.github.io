The tendency is to exaggerate, a natural mistake and one that no coach would fail to recognize. Over the years I had learned to eliminate this tendency. I had mastered the dip and grimace, perfected the semimoan, and when I came off the field this time, after receiving a mild blow on the right calf, nobody considered pressing me back into service. The trainer handed me an ice pack and I sat on the bench next to Bing Jackmin, who kicked field goals and extra points. The practice field was miserably hot. I was relieved to be off and slightly surprised that I felt guilty about it. Bing Jackmin was wearing headgear; his eyes, deep inside the facemask,&nbsp;&nbsp; seemed&nbsp;&nbsp; crazed&nbsp;&nbsp; by&nbsp;&nbsp; sun&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp; dust&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp; inner visions.</p> 
<p>"Work," he shouted past me. "Work, you substandard industrial robots. Work, work, work, work."</p> 
<p>"Look at them hit," I said. "What a pretty sight. When Coach says hit, we hit. It's so simple."</p> 
<p>"It's not simple, Gary. Reality is constantly being interrupted. We're hardly even aware of it when we're out there. We perform like things with metal claws. But there's the other element. For lack of a better term I call it the psychomythical. That's a phrase I coined myself."</p> 
<p>"I don't like it. What does it refer to?"</p> 
<p>"Ancient warriorship," he said. "Cults devoted to pagan forms of technology. What we do out on that field harks back. It harks back. Why don't you like the term?"</p> 
<p>"It's vague and pretentious. It means nothing. There's only one good thing about it. Nobody could remember a stupid phrase like that for more than five seconds. See, I've already forgotten it." " "Wuuurrrrk. Wuuuurrrrrk."</p> 
<p>"Hobbs'll throw to Jessup now," I said. "He always goes to his tight end on third and short inside the twenty. He's like a retarded computer."</p> 
<p>"For a quarterback Hobbs isn't too bright. But you should have seen him last year, Gary. At least Creed's got him changing plays at the line. Last year it was all Hobbsie could do to keep from upchucking when he saw a blitz coming. Linebackers pawing at the ground, snarling at him. He didn't have what you might call a whole lot of poise."</p> 
<p>"Here comes Cecil off. Is that him?"</p> 
<p>"They got old Cecil. Looks like his shoulder."</p> 
<p>Cecil Rector, a guard, came toward the sideline and Roy Yellin went running in to replace him. The trainer popped Cecil's shoulder back into place. Then Cecil fainted. Bing strolled down that way to have a look at Cecil unconscious. Vern Feck, who coached the linebackers, started shouting at his people. Then he called the special units on to practice kickoS return and coverage. Bing headed slowly up to the 40yard line. He kicked off and the two teams converged, everybody yelling, bodies rolling and bouncing on the scant grass. When it was over Bing came back to the bench. His eyes seemed to belong to some small dark cave animal.</p> 
<p>"Something just happened," he said.</p> 
<p>"You look frightened."</p> 
<p>"You won't believe what just happened. I was standing out there, getting ready to stride toward the ball, when a strange feeling came over me. I was looking right at the football. It was up on the tee. I was standing ten yards away, looking right at it, waiting for the whistle so I could make my approach, and that's when I got this strange insight. I wish I could describe it, Gary, but it was too wild, too unbelievable. It was too everything, man. Nobody would understand what I meant if I tried to describe it."</p> 
<p>"Describe it," I said.</p> 
<p>"I sensed knowledge in the football. I sensed a strange power and restfulness. The football possessed awareness. The football knew what was happening. It knew. I'm sure of it."</p> 
<p>"Are you serious, Bing?"</p> 
<p>"The football knew that this is a football game. It knew that it was the center of the game. It was aware of its own footballness."</p> 
<p>"But was it aware of its own awareness? That's the ultimate test, you know."</p> 
<p>"Go ahead, Gary, play around. I knew you wouldn't understand. It was too unreal. It was uneverything, man."</p> 
<p>"You went ahead and kicked the ball."</p> 
<p>"Naturally," he said. "That's the essence of the word. It's a football, isn't it? It is a foot ball. My foot sought union with the ball."</p> 
<p>We watched Bobby Hopper get about eighteen on a sweep. When the play ended a defensive tackle named Dickie Kidd remained on his knees. He managed to take his helmet off and then fell forward, his face hitting the midfield stripe. Two players dragged him off and Raymond Toon went running in to replace him. The next play fell apart when Hobbs fumbled the snap. Creed spoke to him through the bullhorn. Bing walked along the bench to look at Dickie Kidd.</p> 
<p>I watched the scrimmage. It was getting mean out there. The players were reaching the point where they wanted to inflict harm. It was hardly a time for displays of finesse and ungoverned grace. This was the ugly hour. I felt like getting back in. Bing took his seat again.</p> 
<p>"How's Dickie?"</p> 
<p>"Dehydration," Bing said. "Hauptfuhrer's giving him hell."</p> 
<p>"What for?"</p> 
<p>"For dehydrating."</p> 
<p>I went over to Oscar Veech and told him I was ready. He said they wanted to take a longer look at Jim Deering. I watched Deering drop a short pass and get hit a full two seconds later by Buddy Shock, a linebacker. This cheered me up and I returned to the bench.</p> 
<p>"They want to look at Deering some more."</p> 
<p>"Coach is getting edgy. We open in six days. This is the last scrimmage and he wants to look at everybody."</p> 
<p>"I wish I knew how good we are."</p> 
<p>"Coach must be thinking the same thing."</p> 
<p>Time was called and the coaches moved in to lecture their players. Creed climbed down from the tower and walked slowly toward Garland Hobbs. He took off his baseball cap and brushed it against his thigh as he walked. Hobbs saw him coming and instinctively put on his helmet. Creed engaged him in conversation.</p> 
<p>"It's a tonguelashing," Bing said. "Coach is hacking at poor old Hobbsie."</p> 
<p>"He seems pretty calm."</p> 
<p>"It's a tonguelashing," Bing hissed to Cecil Rector, who was edging along the bench to sit next to us.</p> 
<p>"How's the shoulder?" I said.</p> 
<p>"Dislocated."</p> 
<p>"Too bad."</p> 
<p>"They can put a harness on it," he said. "We go in six days. If Coach needs me, I'll be ready."</p> 
<p>Just then Creed looked toward Bing Jackmin, drawing him off the bench without even a nod. Bing jogged over there. The rest of the players were standing or kneeüng between the 40yard lines. Next to me, Cecil Rector leaned over and plucked at blades of grass. I thought of the Adirondaoks, chill lakes of inverted timber, sash of blue snow across the mountains, the whispering presence of the things that filled my room. Far beyond the canvas blinds, on the top floor of the women's dormitory, a figure stood by an open window. I thought of women. I thought of women in snow and rain, on mountains and in forests, at the end of long galleries immersed in the brave light of Rembrandts.</p> 
<p>"Coach is real anxious," Rector said. "He knows a lot of people are watching to see how he does. I bet the wire services send somebody out to cover the opener. If they can ever find this place."</p> 
<p>"I'd really like to get back in."</p> 
<p>"So would I," he said. "Yellin's been haunting me since way back last spring. He's like a hyena. Every time I get hurt, Roy Yellin is right there grinning. He likes to see me get hurt. He's after my job. Every time I'm face down on the grass in pain, I know I'll look up to see Roy Yellin grinning at the injured part of my body. His daddy sells mutual funds in the prairie states."</p> 
<p>Bing came back, apparently upset about something.</p> 
<p>"He wants me to practice my squib kick tomorrow. I told him I don't have any squib kick. He guaranteed me I'd have one by tomorrow night. Then he called Onan over and picked him apart. Told him he was playing center as if the position had just been invented."</p> 
<p>"They're putting Randy King in for Onan," I said.</p> 
<p>"Onan's been depressed," Bing said. "He found out Ms girl friend spent a night with some guy on leave from Nam. It's affecting his play."</p> 
<p>"What did they do?" Rector said.</p> 
<p>"They spent a night."</p> 
<p>"Did they have relations?"</p> 
<p>"Are you asking me did they fuck?"</p> 
<p>"There goes Taft again," I said. "Look at that cutback. God, that's beautiful."</p> 
<p>"He's some kind of football player."</p> 
<p>"He's a real good one."</p> 
<p>"He can do it all, can't he?"</p> 
<p>They played for another fifteen minutes. On the final play, after a long steady drive that took the offense down to the 8yard line, Taft fumbled the handoff. Defense recovered, whistles blew, and that was it for the day. The three of us headed back together.</p> 
<p>"Hobbsie laid it right in his gut and he goes and loses it," Rector said. "I attribute that kind of error to lack of concentration. That's a mental error and it's caused by lack of concentration. Coloreds can run and leap but they can't concentrate. A colored is a runner and leaper. You're making a big mistake if you ask him to concentrate."</p> 
<p>A very heavy girl wearing an orange dress came walking toward us across a wide lawn. There was a mushroom cloud appliquéd on the front of her dress. I recognized the girl; we had some classes together. I let the others walk on ahead and I stood for a moment watching her walk past me and move into the distance. I was wearing a smudge of lampblack under each eye to reduce the sun's glare. I didn't know whether the lampblack was very effective but I liked the way it looked and I liked the idea of painting myself in a barbaric manner before going forth to battle in mud. I wondered if the fat girl knew I was still watching her. I had a vivid picture of myself standing there holding my helmet at my side, left knee bent slightly, hah all mussed and the lampblack under my eyes. Her dress was brightest orange. I thought she must be a little crazy to wear a dress like that with her figure.</p>
