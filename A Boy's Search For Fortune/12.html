<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It doesn't seem as if this was our last night in the old shanty," said Jake Bradley, taking the pipe from his mouth. "It ain't a palace, but I shall kinder hate to leave it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I've got to feel very much at home here myself, Jake; still, I should like to get somewhere where it isn't quite so far out of the world."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "There's something in that, Ben."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I haven't heard anything from home for a good many weeks; I wish I knew whether my uncle's family are all well."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How many is there in the family, Ben?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "There's Uncle Job and Aunt Hannah and Cousin Jennie."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That's just what I thought," said Jake.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I don't understand you," said Ben, puzzled. "What did you think?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I thought there was a Cousin Jennie."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Our hero laughed, and, it may be, blushed a little. "What made you think that?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "There generally is, I notice," said Mr. Bradley, eagerly. "Is Cousin Jennie pretty?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "To be sure she is."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I thought that too, Ben."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What are you driving at, Jake?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I was sure there was some one besides the old folks that you was anxious about."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, you happen to be right," said Ben, laughing. "But I must tell you that Jennie is only fourteen, and I am only sixteen."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You'll both of you be older some day, Ben. But there's a matter that we must settle before we go."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What's that?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "About the gold we have found since we've been here. We must have some arrangement about dividin' it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We sha'n't quarrel about that, Jake."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, there's no danger of that. That'll be easy enough. We'll divide it into two piles, one for you, and the other for me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Jake, I have no right to half of it. You ought to have two-thirds."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I'd like to argy that matter, Ben. Why should I have two-thirds?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Because you earned it. You understood mining better than I."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We're equal partners, Ben. I stick to that, and I mean to have my way. I've been making a little calculation, and I reckon there's nigh on to a thousand dollars for the two of us."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "As much as that, Jake?" said Ben, eagerly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I reckon there is, though I can't justly tell."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It doesn't seem possible I can be worth five hundred dollars," said Ben, thoughtfully. "We've only been here four weeks. That makes a hundred and twenty-five dollars a week."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "So it does. That's pretty high pay for a boy."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Before I left home," said Ben, "there was an old farmer, Deacon Pitkins, who wanted to hire me for a year. What do you think he offered me?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How much?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Twenty dollars a year and board," answered Ben.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I reckon you did better to come to Californy."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It looks so now. How the old deacon would stare if he knew how I had been prospering at the mines! I wish there was any way of sending part of this money home. I would like to make a present to Uncle Job."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "When you get to 'Frisco you won't have any trouble about sendin' it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Uncle Job thought it was very risky for a boy like me to leave home and seek my fortune in California. I would like to prove to him that I didn't make a mistake."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It's likely you haven't, Ben," said Bradley cautiously, "but you ain't out of the woods yet. I hope things will go on as well as they have, and you'll be able to carry a pile home. But we've got to start in good season to-morrow, and we may as well turn in and go to sleep."
