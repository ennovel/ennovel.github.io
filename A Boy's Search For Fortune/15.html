<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Bill Mosely and Tom Hadley did not become reconciled to the loss of their stolen horses. They found it much less agreeable to use their own legs than the legs of the two mustangs which had borne them so comfortably over the hills. They cursed the fate which had led to their meeting with Ki Sing, and the poor Chinaman would have fared worse at their hands had they anticipated the trouble which he indirectly brought them.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Bill Mosely was naturally lazy; any sort of work he considered beneath him, and he desired to avoid all possible trouble in the lawless and vagabond life which he had chosen. He took it worse, indeed, than his companion, who was neither so shiftless nor so lazy as he.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 During the few days which had elapsed since they were glad to leave the mountain-cabin they had averaged less than ten miles' daily travel. They had money enough to purchase animals to replace those which had been taken from them, but had not found any one who was willing to sell for a reasonable price, and Mosely, though he came easily by his money, was far from lavish in the spending of it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 It chanced that an hour after the arrival of Richard Dewey and his party at the Golden Gulch Hotel, Mosely and his companion, dusty and tired, approached the small mining-settlement, of which the hotel was the principal building.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They had had nothing to eat since morning, and both of them felt hungry, not to say ravenous.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Thank Heaven, Tom, there's a mining-town!" ejaculated Mosely, with an expression of devotion not usual to him. "Now we can get something to eat, and I, for my part, feel as empty as a drum. It's hard travelling on an empty stomach."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I should say so," remarked Mr. Hadley, with his usual formula. It must be admitted, however, that in the present instance he was entirely sincere, and fully meant what he said.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "There's a hotel," said Tom Hadley, a minute later, venturing on an original observation.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "So there is; what is the name?" inquired Mosely, who was not as far-sighted as his companion.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The Golden Gulch Hotel," answered Hadley, shading his eyes and reading from a distance of fifty rods the pretentious sign of the little inn.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I suppose they'll charge a fortune for a supper," said Mosely, whose economical spirit was troubled by the exorbitant prices then prevalent in California, "but we must have it at any cost."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I should say so," assented Tom Hadley, cordially.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You always have a good appetite of your own," observed Mosely, not without sarcasm, which, however, Tom Hadley was too obtuse to comprehend.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I should say so," returned Tom complacently, as if he had received a compliment.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No doubt you'll get your money's worth, no matter how much we pay for supper."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Tom Hadley himself was of this opinion, and so expressed himself.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They had already caught sight of two mustangs which were browsing near the Golden Gulch Hotel, and the sight of these useful animals excited the envy and longing of Bill Mosely.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you see them mustangs, Tom?" he inquired.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I should say so."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I wish we had them."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Couldn't we take them?" suggested Hadley, his face brightening at the thought of this easy mode of acquiring what they so much needed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Are you mad, Tom Hadley?" returned Bill Mosely, shrugging his shoulders. "Are you anxious to die?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I should say--not."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then you'd better not think of carrying off them horses. Why, we'd have the whole pack of miners after us, and we'd die in our boots before twenty-four hours had passed."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 On the whole, this prospect did not appear to be of an encouraging character, and Tom Hadley quietly dropped the plan.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Perhaps we can buy them," suggested Mosely by way of amendment. "I've got tired of tramping over these hills on foot. After we've got some supper we'll inquire who they belong to."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Up to this point neither Mosely nor his companion suspected that the mustangs which they desired to purchase had once been in their possession. That discovery was to come later.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Before reaching the Golden Gulch Hotel they encountered the landlord, already introduced as Jim Brown.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Mr. Brown scanned the new-comers with an eye to business. Being strangers, he naturally looked upon them as possible customers, and was disposed from motives of policy to cultivate their acquaintance.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Evenin', strangers," he remarked, as affably as a rather gruff voice and manner would permit.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Good-evening," said Bill Mosely, socially. "What might be the name of this settlement?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You kin see the name on that sign yonder, stranger, ef your eyes are strong enough."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Golden Gulch?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I reckon."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It ought to be a good place, from the name."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It's middlin' good. Where might you be from?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We're prospectin' a little," answered Bill Mosely vaguely; for there had been circumstances in his California career that made it impolitic to be too definite in his statements.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Where are you bound?" continued the landlord, with that licensed curiosity which no one ventured to object to in California.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That depends upon circumstances, my friend," said Bill Mosely, guardedly. "We may go to 'Frisco, and then again we may not. To-night we propose to remain here in Golden Gulch. Is that a comfortable hotel?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, stranger, seein' I keep it myself, it mightn't be exactly the thing for me to say much about it; but I reckon you won't complain of it if you stop there."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I'm glad to meet you," said Bill Mosely, grasping the landlord's hand fervently. "I don't need to ask any more about it, seein' you're the landlord. You look like a man that can keep a hotel--eh, Tom?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I should say so," returned Tom Hadley, making the answer that was expected of him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You're a gentleman!" said Jim Brown, on whom this flattery had its effect. "Just come along with me and I'll see that you are treated as such."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What are your terms, say, for supper and lodgin', landlord?" asked Bill, with commendable caution.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Five dollars," answered Brown.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Bill Mosely's jaw fell. He had hoped it would be less.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And for supper alone?" he asked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Two dollars."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We'll only take supper," said Mosely.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Just as you say."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "We're so used to campin' out that we couldn't breathe in-doors--eh, Tom?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I should say so, Bill."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Suit yourselves, strangers. I reckon you'll want breakfast in the mornin'."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "As likely as not." Then, turning his attention to the mustangs: "Are them mustangs yours, landlord?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No; they belong to a party that's stoppin' with me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Will they sell?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I reckon not. There's a lame man in the party, and he can't walk much."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "A lame man? Who is with him?" asked Bill Mosely, with a sudden suspicion of the truth.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, there's another man and a boy and a heathen Chinee."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Tom," said Bill Mosely, in excitement, "it's the party we left on the mountain."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I should say so, Bill."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you know them, strangers?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Know them?" ejaculated Bill Mosely, who instantly formed a plan which would gratify his love of vengeance and secure him the coveted horses at one and the same time--"I reckon I know them only too well. They stole those mustangs from me and my friend a week ago. I thought them animals looked natural."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Hoss-thieves!" said the landlord. "Well, I surmised there was something wrong about them when they let that yaller heathen set down to the table with them."&nbsp;
