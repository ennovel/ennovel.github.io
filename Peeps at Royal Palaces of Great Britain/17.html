In early days it stood as a stronghold against the barbarous Highlanders of the North, acting as the frontier post of civilization. For fifty years during the War of Independence, the castle was alternately held by the English or the Scotch, whichever party was at the time dominant in the country. Crowning the summit of a sudden outburst of volcanic [pg 79] rock, the castle was practically impregnable to all save treachery, and was therefore constantly used as the residence for the Stuart Kings during their minority.

<br> Stirling Castle.
<br> 
<br> But being one of the Three Keys of the kingdom, its possession was eagerly sought during any foreign or civil war, great efforts being made both to attain and retain it. In 1296, Edward I. took Stirling for the second time, and held it for three years. Wallace had won a great victory within sight of the walls, a victory which had dispersed the English army, but had not been sufficient to take the castle. When the Scots obtained possession in the winter of 1299 after starving the garrison into surrendering, Sir William Oliphant became governor of the castle, to himself sustain a siege of many months in 1304. Edward I. was so angry at being hindered from his purpose for so long, that when he at last gained the castle he broke faith with Oliphant, sending him to the Tower of London. Ten years later, when Robert Bruce was winning back Scotland from the feeble grasp of Edward II., Stirling still held out. With superlative chivalry, Edward Bruce, who was conducting the siege, promised a year's respite, after which the castle must surrender unless relieved. Urged by dire necessity, Edward II. was persuaded to leave his frivolous Court, and gathering a magnificent army to march to Scotland. But all their splendid equipment did not avail against the courage and [pg 80] ingenuity of the Bruce, who, on the field of Bannockburn won for Scotland her greatest victory. Thousands of the English lay dead upon the field, while Edward fled for his life. Stirling Castle surrendered, and its fortifications were levelled.
<br> 
<br> Once again Stirling was to be held by the English, when Bruce's son was on the throne; but in 1342 it was regained, never to fall again into the hands of a foreign foe.
<br> 
<br> In a room in the castle, still pointed out by the guide, William, Earl of Douglas, was murdered by his royal master, James II. By special invitation, backed by a safe-conduct signed by the King, Douglas had come to Stirling in 1452. When supper was over, the King took Douglas into an inner room, where he accused him of being in league with Ross and Crawford against his monarch, and ordered him to break his bond. The haughty Douglas refused to do so, whereat James, forgetful of his safe-conduct, struck at him with his dagger, and the courtiers in attendance, dashing to the assistance of their King, Douglas fell covered with wounds, as the Duc de Guise was to do over a century later in the cabinet of Henri III.
<br> 
<br> Douglas was undoubtedly a danger to his country, at the head of so powerful and unruly a house, but James should have taken more legal measures to subdue him. However, the Parliament of his day acquitted him of all blame.
<br> 
<br> STIRLING CASTLE.
<br> 
<br> One of the three Keys of Scotland, acting as a stronghold against the Highlanders of the North.
<br> 
<br> His son, James III., lived constantly at Stirling, which was his favourite residence, building the Parliament House which still remains. His interest in the Chapel Royal, to whose endowments he wished to add the rich priory of Coldingham, aroused the enmity of [pg 81] the Homes and Hepburns, who regarding Coldingham as a family property, rose against the King. To his lasting remorse the King's son, James IV., fought against his father, who was killed after the battle of Sauchieburn. The young King really grieved, and in order that he should never forget, it is said he wore a belt of iron round his waist, adding an extra link every year.
<br> 
<br> From all the records of legal expenditure, it is evident that James IV. was a great palace builder. He is responsible for much building at Holyrood, Linlithgow, and Falkland, and at Stirling too he did most of the building of the palace, which was carried on by his son.
<br> 
<br> Both Mary Queen of Scots and James VI. were crowned at Stirling as mere infants, the ceremony taking place in the parish church, just below the castle. Queen Mary revisited the scene of her coronation when she returned to Scotland, after her long sojourn in France. She came there with young Lord Darnley as her husband in 1565, and in December, the following year, her infant son, James, was baptized with great ceremony at Stirling. Many lords and nobles assembled, wearing only their swords in order that there might be less danger of disturbance, while the royal child was carried to the chapel by Lady Argyll, acting for Queen Elizabeth, between an avenue of gentlemen bearing wax torches. The only ominous sign amidst the festivities was the absence of the father, Lord Darnley, who remained sulking in the palace.
<br> 
<br> Fourteen months later the poor infant was crowned, his mother being forced to abdicate. Another hurried ceremony took place, the crown being held over the King's head, and the baby hand guided to the sword and sceptre. The Earl of Morton took the oath [pg 82] as substitute, and then the infant was carried back to the castle in the arms of the hereditary governor of the castle, the Earl of Mar. For many years James VI. remained carefully guarded within the castle walls, never allowed to roam without first getting permission, until he had grown to man's estate. Yet he bore no ill-will to Stirling, to which he brought his wife, Anne of Denmark, and where his eldest son, Prince Henry, was born. After the desire of his life had been achieved, and he had become King of Great Britain, he paid one visit to Stirling in 1617, after which the castle was only used on one other occasion as a palace, when Charles I. came there in 1633.
<br> 
<br> The castle remained in the charge of the Earls of Mar until the Rebellion of 1715, when their connection with the rising caused the attainder of the Earl, and the loss of all his offices.
