<br> 
<br> By long roads rides Sigurd, till he comes at the last up on to Hindfell, and wends his way south to the land of the Franks; and he sees before him on the fell a great light, as of fire burning, and flaming up even unto the heavens; and when he came thereto, lo, a shield hung castle before him, and a banner on the topmost thereof: into the castle went Sigurd, and saw one lying there asleep, and all-armed. Therewith he takes the helm from off the head of him, and sees that it is no man, but a woman; and she was clad in a byrny as closely set on her as though it had gown to her flesh; so he rent it from the collar downwards; and then the sleeves thereof, and ever the sword bit on it as if it were cloth. Then said Sigurd that over-long had she lain asleep; but she asked —
<br> 
<br> “What thing of great might is it that has prevailed to rend my byrny, and draw me from my sleep?”
<br> 
<br> Even as sings the song 39
<br> 
<br> “What bit on the byrny,
<br> 
<br> Why breaks my sleep away,
<br> 
<br> Who has turned from me
<br> 
<br> My wan tormenting?”
<br> 
<br> “Ah, is it so, that here is come Sigurd Sigmundson, bearing Fafnir’s helm on his head and Fafnir’s bane in his hand?”
<br> 
<br> Then answered Sigurd —
<br> 
<br> “Sigmund’s son
<br> 
<br> With Sigurd’s sword
<br> 
<br> E’en now rent down
<br> 
<br> The raven’s wall.”
<br> 
<br> “Of the Volsung’s kin is he who has done the deed; but now I have heard that thou art daughter of a mighty king, and folk have told us that thou wert lovely and full of lore, and now I will try the same.”
<br> 
<br> Then Brynhild sang —
<br> 
<br> “Long have I slept
<br> 
<br> And slumbered long,
<br> 
<br> Many and long are the woes of mankind,
<br> 
<br> By the might of Odin
<br> 
<br> Must I bide helpless
<br> 
<br> To shake from off me the spells of slumber.
<br> 
<br> “Hail to the day come back!
<br> 
<br> Hail, sons of the daylight!
<br> 
<br> Hail to thee, dark night, and thy daughter!
<br> 
<br> Look with kind eyes a-down,
<br> 
<br> On us sitting here lonely,
<br> 
<br> And give unto us the gain that we long for.
<br> 
<br> “Hail to the Aesir,
<br> 
<br> And the sweet Asyniur! 40
<br> 
<br> Hail to the fair earth fulfilled of plenty!
<br> 
<br> Fair words, wise hearts,
<br> 
<br> Would we win from you,
<br> 
<br> And healing hands while life we hold.”
<br> 
<br> Then Brynhild speaks again and says, “Two kings fought, one hight Helm Gunnar, an old man, and the greatest of warriors, and Odin had promised the victory unto him; but his foe was Agnar, or Audi’s brother, and so I smote down Helm Gunnar in the fight; and Odin, in vengeance for that deed, stuck the sleep-thorn into me, and said that I should never again have the victory, but should be given away in marriage; but there against I vowed a vow, that never would I wed one who knew the name of fear.”
<br> 
<br> Then said Sigurd, “Teach us the lore of mighty matters!”
<br> 
<br> She said, “Belike thou cannest more skill in all than I; yet will I teach thee; yea, and with thanks, if there be aught of my cunning that will in anywise pleasure thee, either of runes or of other matters that are the root of things; but now let us drink together, and may the Gods give to us twain a good day, that thou mayst win good help and fame from my wisdom, and that thou mayst hereafter mind thee of that which we twain speak together.”
<br> 
<br> Then Brynhild filled a beaker and bore it to Sigurd, and gave him the drink of love, and spake —
<br> 
<br> “Beer bring I to thee,
<br> 
<br> Fair fruit of the byrnies’ clash,
<br> 
<br> Mixed is it mightily,
<br> 
<br> Mingled with fame,
<br> 
<br> Brimming with bright lays
<br> 
<br> And pitiful runes,
<br> 
<br> Wise words, sweet words,
<br> 
<br> Speech of great game.
<br> 
<br> “Runes of war know thou,
<br> 
<br> If great thou wilt be!
<br> 
<br> Cut them on hilt of hardened sword,
<br> 
<br> Some on the brand’s back,
<br> 
<br> Some on its shining side,
<br> 
<br> Twice name Tyr therein.
<br> 
<br> “Sea-runes good at need,
<br> 
<br> Learnt for ship’s saving,
<br> 
<br> For the good health of the swimming horse;
<br> 
<br> On the stern cut them,
<br> 
<br> Cut them on the rudder-blade
<br> 
<br> And set flame to shaven oar:
<br> 
<br> Howso big be the sea-hills,
<br> 
<br> Howso blue beneath,
<br> 
<br> Hail from the main then comest thou home.
<br> 
<br> “Word-runes learn well
<br> 
<br> If thou wilt that no man
<br> 
<br> Pay back grief for the grief thou gavest;
<br> 
<br> Wind thou these,
<br> 
<br> Weave thou these,
<br> 
<br> Cast thou these all about thee,
<br> 
<br> At the Thing,
<br> 
<br> Where folk throng,
<br> 
<br> Unto the full doom faring.
<br> 
<br> “Of ale-runes know the wisdom
<br> 
<br> If thou wilt that another’s wife
<br> 
<br> Should not bewray thine heart that trusteth:
<br> 
<br> Cut them on the mead-horn,
<br> 
<br> On the back of each hand,
<br> 
<br> And nick an N upon thy nail.
<br> 
<br> “Ale have thou heed
<br> 
<br> To sign from all harm
<br> 
<br> Leek lay thou in the liquor,
<br> 
<br> Then I know for sure
<br> 
<br> Never cometh to thee,
<br> 
<br> Mead with hurtful matters mingled.
<br> 
<br> “Help-runes shalt thou gather
<br> 
<br> If skill thou wouldst gain
<br> 
<br> To loosen child from low-laid mother;
<br> 
<br> Cut be they in hands hollow,
<br> 
<br> Wrapped the joints round about;
<br> 
<br> Call for the Good-folks’ gainsome helping.
<br> 
<br> “Learn the bough-runes wisdom
<br> 
<br> If leech-lore thou lovest;
<br> 
<br> And wilt wot about wounds’ searching
<br> 
<br> On the bark be they scored;
<br> 
<br> On the buds of trees
<br> 
<br> Whose boughs look eastward ever.
<br> 
<br> “Thought-runes shalt thou deal with
<br> 
<br> If thou wilt be of all men
<br> 
<br> Fairest-souled wight, and wisest,
<br> 
<br> These areded
<br> 
<br> These first cut
<br> 
<br> These first took to heart high Hropt.
<br> 
<br> “On the shield were they scored
<br> 
<br> That stands before the shining God,
<br> 
<br> On Early-waking’s ear,
<br> 
<br> On All-knowing’s hoof,
<br> 
<br> On the wheel which runneth
<br> 
<br> Under Rognir’s chariot;
<br> 
<br> On Sleipnir’s jaw-teeth,
<br> 
<br> On the sleigh’s traces.
<br> 
<br> “On the rough bear’s paws,
<br> 
<br> And on Bragi’s tongue,
<br> 
<br> On the wolfs claws,
<br> 
<br> And on eagle’s bill,
<br> 
<br> On bloody wings,
<br> 
<br> And bridge’s end;
<br> 
<br> On loosing palms,
<br> 
<br> And pity’s path:
<br> 
<br> “On glass, and on gold,
<br> 
<br> And on goodly silver,
<br> 
<br> In wine and in wort,
<br> 
<br> And the seat of the witch-wife;
<br> 
<br> On Gungnir’s point,
<br> 
<br> And Grani’s bosom;
<br> 
<br> On the Norn’s nail,
<br> 
<br> And the neb of the night-owl.
<br> 
<br> “All these so cut,
<br> 
<br> Were shaven and sheared,
<br> 
<br> And mingled in with holy mead,
<br> 
<br> And sent upon wide ways enow;
<br> 
<br> Some abide with the Elves,
<br> 
<br> Some abide with the Aesir,
<br> 
<br> Or with the wise Vanir,
<br> 
<br> Some still hold the sons of mankind.
<br> 
<br> “These be the book-runes,
<br> 
<br> And the runes of good help,
<br> 
<br> And all the ale-runes,
<br> 
<br> And the runes of much might;
<br> 
<br> To whomso they may avail,
<br> 
<br> Unbewildered unspoilt;
<br> 
<br> They are wholesome to have:
<br> 
<br> Thrive thou with these then.
<br> 
<br> When thou hast learnt their lore,
<br> 
<br> Till the Gods end thy life-days.
<br> 
<br> “Now shalt thou choose thee
<br> 
<br> E’en as choice is bidden,
<br> 
<br> Sharp steel’s root and stem,
<br> 
<br> Choose song or silence;
<br> 
<br> See to each in thy heart,
<br> 
<br> All hurt has been heeded.”
<br> 
<br> Then answered Sigurd —
<br> 
<br> “Ne’er shall I flee,
<br> 
<br> Though thou wottest me fey;
<br> 
<br> Never was I born for blenching,
<br> 
<br> Thy loved rede will I
<br> 
<br> Hold aright in my heart
<br> 
<br> Even as long as I may live.”
