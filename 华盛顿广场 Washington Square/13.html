<p>But, as he said, he had his impression; it seemed to him sufficient, and he had no wish to modify it.</p> 
<p>He had passed his life in estimating people (it was part of the medical trade), and in nineteen cases out of twenty he was right.</p> 
<p>"Perhaps Mr. Townsend is the twentieth case," Mrs. Almond suggested.</p> 
<p>"Perhaps he is, though he doesn't look to me at all like a twentieth case.</p> 
<p>But I will give him the benefit of the doubt, and, to make sure, I will go and talk with Mrs. Montgomery.</p> 
<p>She will almost certainly tell me I have done right; but it is just possible that she will prove to me that I have made the greatest mistake of my life. If she does, I will beg Mr. Townsend's pardon.</p> 
<p>You needn't invite her to meet me, as you kindly proposed; I will write her a frank letter, telling her how matters stand, and asking leave to come and see her."</p> 
<p>"I am afraid the frankness will be chiefly on your side.</p> 
<p>The poor little woman will stand up for her brother, whatever he may be."</p> 
<p>"Whatever he may be?</p> 
<p>I doubt that.</p> 
<p>People are not always so fond of their brothers."</p> 
<p>"Ah," said Mrs. Almond, "when it's a question of thirty thousand a year coming into a family--"</p> 
<p>"If she stands up for him on account of the money, she will be a humbug.</p> 
<p>If she is a humbug I shall see it.</p> 
<p>If I see it, I won't waste time with her."</p> 
<p>"She is not a humbug--she is an exemplary woman.</p> 
<p>She will not wish to play her brother a trick simply because he is selfish."</p> 
<p>"If she is worth talking to, she will sooner play him a trick than that he should play Catherine one.</p> 
<p>Has she seen Catherine, by the way--does she know her?"</p> 
<p>"Not to my knowledge.</p> 
<p>Mr. Townsend can have had no particular interest in bringing them together."</p> 
<p>"If she is an exemplary woman, no.</p> 
<p>But we shall see to what extent she answers your description."</p> 
<p>"I shall be curious to hear her description of you!" said Mrs. Almond, with a laugh.</p> 
<p>"And, meanwhile, how is Catherine taking it?"</p> 
<p>"As she takes everything--as a matter of course."</p> 
<p>"Doesn't she make a noise?</p> 
<p>Hasn't she made a scene?"</p> 
<p>"She is not scenic."</p> 
<p>"I thought a love-lorn maiden was always scenic."</p> 
<p>"A fantastic widow is more so.</p> 
<p>Lavinia has made me a speech; she thinks me very arbitrary."</p> 
<p>"She has a talent for being in the wrong," said Mrs. Almond.</p> 
<p>"But I am very sorry for Catherine, all the same."</p> 
<p>"So am I.</p> 
<p>But she will get over it."</p> 
<p>"You believe she will give him up?"</p> 
<p>"I count upon it.</p> 
<p>She has such an admiration for her father."</p> 
<p>"Oh, we know all about that!</p> 
<p>But it only makes me pity her the more. It makes her dilemma the more painful, and the effort of choosing between you and her lover almost impossible."</p> 
<p>"If she can't choose, all the better."</p> 
<p>"Yes, but he will stand there entreating her to choose, and Lavinia will pull on that side."</p> 
<p>"I am glad she is not on my side; she is capable of ruining an excellent cause.</p> 
<p>The day Lavinia gets into your boat it capsizes. But she had better be careful," said the Doctor.</p> 
<p>"I will have no treason in my house!"</p> 
<p>"I suspect she will be careful; for she is at bottom very much afraid of you."</p> 
<p>"They are both afraid of me--harmless as I am!" the Doctor answered. "And it is on that that I build--on the salutary terror I inspire!"</p>
