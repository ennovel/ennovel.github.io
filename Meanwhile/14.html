He made a scarcely perceptible noise, but she was alert. “Phil dear!” she cried. “Are you there? Phil!”
<br> 
<br> He came softly out of the shadows, stood aloof for a moment, black, mysterious and silent against the blue night, and then was at the bedside. “I hoped you were asleep,” he said.
<br> 
<br> She clicked on her shaded light and the two regarded each other in a sorrowful scrutiny, perplexed with themselves and life.
<br> 
<br> “Cynthia,” he whispered. “Cynthia my darling; can you forgive?”
<br> 
<br> “Perhaps,” she panted and paused. “Perhaps there is nothing to forgive.”
<br> 
<br> “But ——?”
<br> 
<br> “Nothing that matters.”
<br> 
<br> “She’s cleared out.”
<br> 
<br> “It doesn’t matter. Don’t trouble about her. . . . You I think of.”
<br> 
<br> “I’ve been such a beast.”
<br> 
<br> “No. It happened. It had to happen. Something had to happen. You couldn’t help yourself. You’ve nothing to do here. You’ve been a prisoner here, waiting on me.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh! don’t say that. I meant to be so dear to you — my dear. But there’s something rotten in me.”
<br> 
<br> “No, no. Rotten! Dear, Phil dear, you’re not even ripe. But I’ve let you stay here. . . . ” She put out her hand and he sat himself on the bed beside her. He kissed her. “My dear,” he said. “Dear! Dear!”
<br> 
<br> “Listen,” she said and kept her hand upon him. She whispered. Both spoke in whispers. “Go to England, dear one. Things are happening there. Trouble and muddle. Men — men ought to work. You — you ought to find out. You ought to understand. You so rich and — responsible. Things have to be done. I can stay here. . . . ”
<br> 
<br> “You banish me?”
<br> 
<br> “No. This is banishment. Here. Here I can’t help you — to grow into the man you have to be. Not now. I’ve got to be three parts vegetable for a bit now — and then a sort of cow. No fit companion for a growing man. I don’t mind, dear. It’s worth it. It’s what I’m for. It had to be. But you —you go home to England now. You can’t stand idleness. You can’t stand these long empty days.”
<br> 
<br> He released her and sat thinking it out.
<br> 
<br> After a long pause he said, “I think you are right. I ought to go.”
<br> 
<br> “Yes —go.”
<br> 
<br> “We’ve got all the Red Valley property. All that Yorkshire stretch. The Vale of Edensoke. A third perhaps of the Rylands millions is in coal. I ought to know about it. I’ve let the older men, Uncle Robert and the others, do what they pleased.”
<br> 
<br> Now that was a man!
<br> 
<br> “Go for that,” she said. “Go for the sake of that.”
<br> 
<br> He turned his eyes to her. She did her best to look at him with a grave, quiet, convincing face and her strength was not enough. Suddenly the calm of her countenance broke under her distress and she wept like a struck child.
<br> 
<br> “Oh my dear!” he cried in an agony of helplessness; “that I should hurt you now! What have I done to you?” and threw his arms about her and drew her up close to him, very close to him, and kissed the salt tears.
<br> 
<br> “Poor Phil!” she clung to him weeping, smoothing his hair with one hand. “Dear Phil!”
