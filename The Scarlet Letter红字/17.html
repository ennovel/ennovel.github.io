"Dost thou not think her beautiful? And see with what natural skill she has made those simple flowers adorn her! Had she gathered pearls, and diamonds, and rubies, in the wood, they could not have become her better. She is a splendid child! But I know whose brow she has!"</p> 
<p>"Dost thou know, Hester," said Arthur Dimmesdale, with an unquiet smile, "that this dear child, tripping about always at thy side, hath caused me many an alarm? Methought- O Hester, what a thought is that, and how terrible to dread it!- that my own features were partly repeated in her face, and so strikingly that the world might see them! But she is mostly thine!"</p> 
<p>"No, no! Not mostly!" answered the mother, with a tender smile. "A little longer and thou needest not be afraid to trace whose child she is. But how strangely beautiful she looks, with those wild flowers in her hair! It is as if one of the fairies, whom we left in our dear old England, had decked her out to meet us."</p> 
<p>It was with a feeling which neither of them had ever before experienced, that they sat and watched Pearl's slow advance. In her was visible the tie that united them. She had been offered to the world, these seven years past, as the living hieroglyphic, in which was revealed the secret they so darkly sought to hide- all written in this symbol- all plainly manifest- had there been a prophet or magician skilled to read the character of flame! And Pearl was the oneness of their being. Be the foregone evil what it might, how could they doubt that their earthly lives and future destinies were conjoined, when they beheld at once the material union, and the spiritual idea, in whom they met, and were to dwell immortally together? Thoughts like these- and perhaps other thoughts, which they did not acknowledge or define- threw an awe about the child, as she came onward.</p> 
<p>"Let her see nothing strange- no passion nor eagerness- in thy way of accosting her," whispered Hester. "Our Pearl is a fitful and fantastic little elf, sometimes. Especially, she is seldom tolerant of emotion, when she does not fully comprehend the why and wherefore. But the child hath strong affections! She loves me, and will love thee!"</p> 
<p>"Thou canst not think," said the minister, glancing aside at Hester Prynne, "how my heart dreads this interview, and yearns for it! But, in truth, as I already told thee, children are not readily won to be familiar with me. They will not climb my knee, nor prattle in my ear, nor answer to my smile; but stand apart, and eye me strangely. Even little babes, when I take them in my arms, weep bitterly. Yet Pearl, twice in her little lifetime, hath been kind to me! The first time- thou knowest it well! The last was when thou ledst her with thee to the house of yonder stern old Governor."</p> 
<p>"And thou didst plead so bravely in her behalf and mine!" answered the mother. "I remember it; and so shall little Pearl. Fear nothing! She may be strange and shy at first, but will soon learn to love thee!"</p> 
<p>By this time Pearl had reached the margin of the brook, and stood on the farther side, gazing silently at Hester and the clergyman, who still sat together on the mossy tree-trunk, waiting to receive her. Just where she had paused, the brook chanced to form a pool, so smooth and quiet that it reflected a perfect image of her little figure, with all the brilliant picturesqueness of her beauty, in its adornment of flowers and wreathed foliage, but more refined and spiritualised than the reality. This image, so nearly identical with the living Pearl, seemed to communicate somewhat of its own shadowy and intangible quality to the child herself. It was strange, the way in which Pearl stood, looking so steadfastly at them through the dim medium of the forest-gloom; herself, meanwhile, all glorified with a ray of sunshine, that was attracted thitherward as by a certain sympathy. In the brook beneath stood another child- another and the same- with likewise its ray of golden light. Hester felt herself, in some indistinct and tantalising manner, estranged from Pearl; as if the child, in her lonely, ramble through the forest, had strayed out of the sphere in which she and her mother dwelt together, and was now vainly seeking to return to it.</p> 
<p>There was both truth and error in the impression; the child and mother were estranged, but through Hester's fault, not Pearl's. Since the latter rambled from her side, another inmate had been admitted within the circle of the mother's feelings, and so modified the aspect of them all, that Pearl, the returning wanderer, could not find her wonted place, and hardly knew where she was.</p> 
<p>"I have a strange fancy," observed the sensitive minister, "that this brook is the boundary between two worlds, and that thou canst never meet thy Pearl again. Or is she an elfish spirit, who, as the legends of our childhood taught us, is forbidden to cross a running stream? Pray hasten her; for this delay has already imparted a tremor to my nerves."</p> 
<p>"Come, dearest child!" said Hester encouragingly, and stretching out both her arms. "How slow thou art! When hast thou been so sluggish before now? Here is a friend of mine, who must be thy friend also. Thou wilt have twice as much love, henceforward, as thy mother alone could give thee! Leap across the brook, and come to us. Thou canst leap like a young deer!"</p> 
<p>Pearl, without responding in any manner to these honey-sweet expressions, remained on the other side of the brook. Now she fixed her bright, wild eyes on her mother, now on the minister, and now included them both in the same glance; as if to detect and explain to herself the relation which they bore to one another. For some unaccountable reason, as Arthur Dimmesdale felt the child's eyes upon himself, his hand- with that gesture so habitual as to have become involuntary- stole over his heart. At length, assuming a singular air of authority, Pearl stretched out her hand, with the small forefinger extended, and pointing evidently towards her mother's breast. And beneath, in the mirror of the brook, there was the flower-girdled and sunny image of little Pearl, pointing her small forefinger too.</p> 
<p>"Thou strange child, why dost thou not come to me?" exclaimed Hester.</p> 
<p>Pearl still pointed with her forefinger; and a frown gathered on her brow; the more impressive from the childish, the almost baby-like aspect of the features that conveyed it. As her mother still kept beckoning to her, and arraying her face in a holiday suit of unaccustomed smiles, the child stamped her foot with a yet more imperious look and gesture. In the brook, again, was the fantastic beauty of the image, with its reflected frown, its pointed finger, and imperious gesture, giving emphasis to the aspect of little Pearl.</p> 
<p>"Hasten, Pearl; or I shall be angry with thee!" cried Hester Prynne, who, however inured to such behaviour on the elf-child's part at other seasons, was naturally anxious for a more seemly deportment now. "Leap across the brook, naughty child, and run hither! Else I must come to thee!"</p> 
<p>But Pearl, not a whit startled at her mother's threats, any more than mollified by her entreaties, now suddenly burst into a fit of passion, gesticulating violently, and throwing her small figure into the most extravagant contortions. She accompanied this wild outbreak with piercing shrieks, which the woods reverberated on all sides; so that, alone as she was in her childish and unreasonable wrath, it seemed as if a hidden multitude were lending her their sympathy and encouragement. Seen in the brook, once more, was the shadowy wraith of Pearl's image, crowned and girdled with flowers, but stamping its foot, wildly gesticulating, and, in the midst of all, still pointing its small forefinger at Hester's bosom!</p> 
<p>"I see what ails the child," whispered Hester to the clergyman, and turning pale in spite of a strong effort to conceal her trouble and annoyance. "Children will not abide any, the slightest, change in the accustomed aspect of things that are daily before their eyes. Pearl misses something which she has always seen me wear!"</p> 
<p>"I pray you," answered the minister, "if thou hast any means of pacifying the child, do it forthwith! Save it were the cankered wrath of an old witch, like Mistress Hibbins," added he, attempting to smile, "I know nothing that I would not sooner encounter than this passion in a child. In Pearl's young beauty, as in the wrinkled witch, it has a preternatural effect. Pacify her, if thou lovest me!"</p> 
<p>Hester turned again towards Pearl, with a crimson blush upon her cheek, a conscious glance aside at the clergyman, and then a heavy sigh; while, even before she had time to speak, the blush yielded to a deadly pallor.</p> 
<p>"Pearl," said she sadly, "look down at thy feet! There- before thee!- the hither side of the brook!"</p> 
<p>The child turned her eyes to the point indicated; and there lay the scarlet letter, so close upon the margin of the stream, that the gold embroidery was reflected in it.</p> 
<p>"Bring it hither!" said Hester.</p> 
<p>"Come thou and take it up!" answered Pearl.</p> 
<p>"Was ever such a child!" observed Hester, aside to the minister. "Oh, I have much to tell thee about her! But, in very truth, she is right as regards this hateful token. I must bear its torture yet a little longer- only a few days longer- until we shall have left this region, and look back hither as to a land which we have dreamed of. The forest cannot hide it! The mid-ocean shall take it from my hand, and swallow it up for ever!"</p> 
<p>With these words, she advanced to the margin of the brook, took up the scarlet letter, and fastened it again into her bosom. Hopefully, but a moment ago, as Hester had spoken of drowning it in the deep sea, there was a sense of inevitable doom upon her, as she thus received back this deadly symbol from the hand of fate. She had flung it into infinite space!- she had drawn an hour's free breath!- and here again was the scarlet misery, glittering on the old spot! So it ever is, whether thus typified or no, that an evil deed invests itself with the character of doom. Hester next gathered up the heavy tresses of her hair, and confined them beneath her cap. As if there were a withering spell in the sad letter, her beauty, the warmth and richness of her womanhood, departed, like fading sunshine; and a grey shadow seemed to fall across her.</p> 
<p>When the dreary change was wrought, she extended her hand to Pearl.</p> 
<p>"Dost thou know thy mother now, child?" asked she reproachfully, but with a subdued tone. "Wilt thou come across the brook, and own thy mother, now that she has her shame upon her- now that she is sad?"</p> 
<p>"Yes; now I will!" answered the child, bounding across the brook, and clasping Hester in her arms. "Now thou art my mother indeed! And I am thy little Pearl!"</p> 
<p>In a mood of tenderness that was not usual with her, she drew down her mother's head, and kissed her brow and both her cheeks. But then- by a kind of necessity that always impelled this child to alloy whatever comfort she might chance to give with a throb of anguish- Pearl put up her mouth, and kissed the scarlet letter too!</p> 
<p>"That was not kind!" said Hester. "When thou hast shown me a little love, thou mockest me!"</p> 
<p>"Why doth the minister sit yonder?" asked Pearl.</p> 
<p>"He waits to welcome thee," replied her mother. "Come thou, and entreat his blessing! He loves thee, my little Pearl, and loves thy mother too. Wilt thou not love him? Come! he longs to greet thee!"</p> 
<p>"Doth he love us?" said Pearl, looking up, with acute intelligence, into her mother's face. "Will he go back with us, hand in hand, we three together into the town?"</p> 
<p>"Not now, dear child," answered Hester. "But in days to come he will walk hand in hand with us. We will have a home and fireside of our own; and thou shalt sit upon his knee; and he will teach thee many things, and love thee dearly. Thou wilt love him; wilt thou not?"</p> 
<p>"And will he always keep his hand over his heart?" inquired Pearl. </p> 
<p>"Foolish child, what a question is that!" exclaimed her mother. "Come and ask his blessing!"</p> 
<p>But, whether influenced by the jealousy that seems instinctive with every petted child towards a dangerous rival, or from whatever caprice of her freakish nature, Pearl would show no favour to the clergyman. It was only by an exertion of force that her mother brought her up to him, hanging back, and manifesting her reluctance by odd grimaces; of which, ever since her babyhood, she had possessed a singular variety, and could transform her mobile physiognomy into a series of different aspects, with a new mischief in them, each and all. The minister- painfully embarrassed, but hoping that a kiss might prove a talisman to admit him into the child's kindlier regards-bent forward, and impressed one on her brow. Hereupon, Pearl broke away from her mother, and, running to the brook, stooped over it, and bathed her forehead, until the unwelcome kiss was quite washed off, and diffused through a long lapse of the gliding water. She then remained apart, silently watching Hester and the clergyman: while they talked together, and made such arrangements as were suggested by their new position, and the purposes soon to be fulfilled.</p> 
<p>And now this fateful interview had come to a close. The dell was to be left a solitude among its dark, old trees, which, with their multitudinous tongues, would whisper long of what had passed there, and no mortal be the wiser. And the melancholy brook would add this other tale to the mystery with which its little heart was already overburdened, and whereof it still kept up a murmuring babble, with not a whit more cheerfulness of tone than for ages heretofore. </p>  
<p>“你知道，海丝特，”阿瑟·丁梅斯代尔带着不安的微笑说， </p> 
<p>“这个总是在你身边蹦蹦跳跳的可爱的孩子，曾经多次引起我心惊肉跳吗？我认为，——噢，海丝特，这是个什么样的念头，而且产生这种顾虑又是多么可怕啊！——我自己的一部分面容重现在她的脸上，而且那么酷似，我真怕人们会认出来！不过，她主要还是象你！” </p> 
<p>“不，不！不是主要象我！”做母亲的露出温柔的微笑回答说。“过不多久，你就不必担心人们会追究她是谁的孩子了。她头发上戴着那些野花，显得她的模样漂亮得多么不平常啊！仿佛有一个被我们留在我们亲爱的老英格兰的仙子，把自己打扮好，跑来迎接我们了。” </p> 
<p>他俩坐在那里，正是怀着一种他们谁也没有体验过的感情来注视着珠儿慢慢走来。在她身上能够看出把他俩连系在一起的纽带。过去这七年里，她作为如同有生命的象形文字，被奉献给人类社会，在她身上揭示了他们竭力要隐藏的秘密，要是有一位先知或法师有本领破解这个火焰般的文字的话，就会懂得一切全都写在这个象征之中，一切全都显示得明明白自！而珠儿就是他俩生命的合而为一。不管以往的邪恶可能是什么，当他们一起看到，由他们交汇并将永在一起共存的肉体结晶和精神概念时，他们怎么可能会怀疑，他们在凡世的生命和未来的命运已经密不可分呢？象这样的想法，以及其它一些他们没有承认或尚未定形的可能的想法，当那孩子向前走着的时候，在她身上投射出一种使人敬畏的色彩。 </p> 
<p>“你跟她搭话的时候，别让她看出什么不同寻常的地方，既不要太热情，也不要太急切，”海丝特轻声说。“我们的珠儿有时候是个一阵阵让人捉摸不定的小精灵。尤其是在她不大明白缘由的时候，很难接受别人的激情。不过，这孩子有着强烈的爱！她爱我，而且也会爱你的！” </p> 
<p>“你难以想象，”牧师说着，偏过头来瞥了一眼海丝特·白兰，“我又害怕这次见面，又盼着这次见面的那种心理！不过，说实话，就象我刚才跟你说的，孩子们是不大乐于同我亲近的。他们不会爬上我的膝头，不肯和我说悄悄话，也不愿回报我的微笑，而只是远远地站着，奇怪地打量着我。连小小的婴儿都一样；我把他们抱在怀里时，他们就使劲哭。可珠儿长这么大，竟有两次对我特别好！头一次，——你知道得很清楚！第二次就是你领她到板着面孔的老总督的那所房子里去的时候。” </p> 
<p>“那次你大胆地为了她和我进行了申辩！”做母亲的回答。 </p> 
<p>“我记得清清楚楚，小珠儿也会记得的。别怕！她开头也许会认生、害躁，但很快就会爱起你来的！” </p> 
<p>这时，珠儿已经来到小溪对岸，站在那儿不出声地瞅着海丝特和牧师，他俩依旧并肩坐在长满青苔的树干上，等着见她。就在她停下脚步的地方，小溪恰好聚成一个池塘，水面平静而光滑，把珠儿那小小的身影完满地映砚出来：她腰缠嫩枝编的花带，使她的美貌绚丽如画，比本人还要精美，更象仙女。那映象几乎与真的珠儿分毫不爽，似乎将其自身的某种阴影般莫测的品性传递给孩子本人了。奇妙的是，珠儿站在那里，不错眼珠地透过林中的幽暗盯视着他们；与此同时，她全身都沐浴在仿佛是被某种感应吸引到她身上的一道阳光中。在她脚下的小溪中站着另一个孩子——是另外一个，但又一模一样——身上同样洒满阳光。海丝特模糊而痛心地感到，她自己好象同珠儿变得陌生起来；好象那孩子独自在森林中游荡时，走出了她和她母亲同居的范围，如今正在徒劳地想回来。 </p> 
<p>这种印象有正确的一面，也有错误的一面；孩子和母亲是变得生疏了，但那要归咎于海丝特，而不是珠儿。自从孩子从她身边走开，另外一个亲人来到了母亲的感情圈内，从而改变了他们三人的地位，以致珠儿这个归来的流浪儿，找不到她一向的位置，几乎不知自己身在何方了。 </p> 
<p>“我有一种奇怪的幻想，”敏感的牧师说，“这条小溪是两个世界之间的分界线，你永远不会再和珠儿相会了。要不，说不定她是个小精灵，象我们儿时的童话所教的，她是不准渡过流淌的溪流的吧？请你赶快催催她；这么耽搁着，已经把我的神经弄得颤抖起来了。” </p> 
<p>“过来，乖宝贝儿！”海丝特给孩子鼓劲说，同时伸出了双臂。 </p> 
<p>“你走得太慢慢腾腾了！你什么时候象现在这样懒洋洋过？这儿有我的一个朋友，他也该是你的朋友。从今以后，你就不只有你妈妈一个人的爱了，你要得到双倍的爱的！跳过小溪，到我们这儿来。你不是可以象一头小鹿一样地跳嘛！” </p> 
<p>珠儿对这些甜蜜的话语不理不睬，仍然呆在小溪的对岸。此时她那一对明亮而狂野的脖子，时而盯着她母亲，时而盯着牧师，时而同时盯住他们两个；仿佛耍想弄清并给自己解释他们两人之间的关系。出于某种难以名状的原因，阿瑟·丁梅斯代尔感到孩子助目光落在他身上时，他的手以习惯成自然的姿势，悄悄捂到了心口上。最后，珠儿作出一副独特的不容置辩的神情，伸出她小小的食指，显然是指着她母亲的胸部。在她脚下，映在镜面般的溪水中的那个戴着花环、浴满阳光的小珠儿的影象，也指点着她的小小的食指。 </p> 
<p>“你这个怪孩子，为什么不到我身边来呢？”海丝特叫道。 </p> 
<p>珠儿依旧用她的食指指点着；眉间渐渐皱起；由于这姿态表情来自一个满脸稚气、甚至象婴儿般面孔的孩子，就给人印象尤深。而由于她母亲仍在不断呼唤她，而且脸上堆满非比寻常的笑容，那孩子便以更加专横的神情和姿态使劲跺着两脚。同样，在小溪中那个美得出奇的形象，也映出了皱着的眉头、伸出的手指和专横的姿态，为小珠儿的模样平添了效果。 </p> 
<p>“快点，珠儿；要不我可要跟你生气了！”海丝特·白兰嚷道，她平时尽管已经熟习了这小精灵似的孩子的这种举止，但此时自然巴不得她能表现得更懂规矩些。“跳过小溪来，顽皮的孩子，跑过来！要不我就过去了！” </p> 
<p>珠儿刚才对她母亲的请求无动于衷，此时对母亲的吓唬也毫不惊惶；却突然大发脾气，做出激烈的姿态，把她小小的身躯弄得七扭八歪。她一边这样狂暴地扭动着，一边厉声尖叫，震得四下的树木一起回响；因此，虽说她只是独自一人毫无道理地大发小孩脾气，却象是有一群不露面的人在同情地绘她助威。此时在小溪中又一次看到殊儿温怒的身影：头戴花冠，腰缠花带，脚下使劲地跺着，身子狂暴地扭着，同时那小小的食指也始终指着海丝特的胸口！ </p> 
<p>“我明白这孩子是怎么回事了，”海丝特对牧师低声说着，由于强按心中的忧烦而变得面色苍白。“孩子们对于每日在眼前司空见惯的东西容不得有丝毫改变。珠儿是看不见我不离身地佩戴的东西了！” </p> 
<p>“我恳求你了，”牧师回答说，“如果你有什么办法能让这孩子安静下来，赶紧拿出来吧！除去象西宾斯太太那样的老妖婆发疯式的愤怒，”他强笑着补充说，“再没有比看到这孩子发脾气更让人不情愿的了。在年幼、美丽的珠儿身上，和那满脸皱纹的老妖婆一样，准有一种超自然的力量。要是你爱我，就让她安静下来吧！” </p> 
<p>海丝特又转向珠儿，这时她脸上泛起红潮，故意斜睨了牧师一眼，然后重重地叹了口气；但她还没来得及开口，红潮就褪成死一般的苍白了。 </p> 
<p>“珠儿，”她伤心地说，“往你脚下瞧！就在那儿！——在你跟前！——在小溪的这边岸上！” </p> 
<p>那孩子的目光转向指给她看的地方；红字就躺在那里，紧靠着岸边，金丝刺绣还在溪中反着光。 </p> 
<p>“把它拣回来！”海丝特说。 </p> 
<p>“你过来拾吧！”珠儿回答道。 </p> 
<p>“哪有这样的孩子！”海丝特回头对牧师评论着。“噢，我有好多她的事要告诉你呢！不过，的的确确，她对这可恨的标记的看法是没错的。我还得再忍受一下这折磨人的玩艺儿，——也就是几天吧，——到那时我们就已经离开这块地方，再回头看看，就只是一块我们曾经梦想过的土地了。这片森林还藏不住它！但汪洋大海可以从我手里把它取走，并且永远把它吞没！”她一边这样说着，一边走到小溪边上，把红字拣起来，重新钉到胸前。仅仅片刻之前，海丝特还满怀希望地谈到要把红字沉进深深的海底，但当她从命运之神的手中重新接过这死一般的象征时，就感到一种难以避免的阴沉笼罩着她。她已经把它抛进了无限的空间！——她曾经吸进了一小时的自由空气！——可现在那红色的悲惨又重新在老地方闪闪发光了！事情从来如此，一种邪恶的行为不管有否这种表征，从来都带有这种厄运的品性。接着，海丝特挽起她浓密的发绺，用帽子罩了起来。似乎在这令人哀伤的字母中有一种枯萎的符咒，她的美丽，她那女性的丰满和温暖，都象落日般地离去了；一抹灰蒙蒙的阴影似是落在了她身上。 </p> 
<p>这一阴郁的变化完成之后，她向珠儿伸出了手。 </p> 
<p>“现在你认识你妈妈了吧，孩子？”她压着声音责问说。“现在你妈妈又戴上了她的耻辱，——她又悲伤了，你愿意走过河来，认她了吧？” </p> 
<p>“是啊；现在我愿意过去了！”孩子回答着，跳过小溪，抱住了海丝特。“现在你才真是我妈妈了！而我也是你的小珠儿了！”珠儿以一种她不常有的温柔劲，往下拽着她母亲的头，亲了她母亲的额头和双颊。可是，似乎有一种必要推动着这孩子，在她偶然给人的某种安慰中溶进一阵极度的苦恼，接着，珠儿抬起她的嘴唇，也把那红字亲吻了一下。 </p> 
<p>“这可不好！”海丝特说。“你对我表示出一点点爱的时候，却要嘲弄我！” </p> 
<p>“牧师干嘛坐在那儿？”珠儿问。 </p> 
<p>“他等着欢迎你呢，”她母亲回答。“你过来，恳求他的祝福吧！他爱你，我的小珠儿，而且也爱你妈妈。难道你不肯爱他吗？来啊！他可想问候你呢！” </p> 
<p>“他爱我们吗？”珠儿说着，目光中流露出明察秋毫的聪慧，抬起眼睛瞅着她母亲的面孔。“他会跟我们手拉着手一起回去——我们三个人一起进镇子去吗？” </p> 
<p>“这会儿还不成，我的乖孩子，”海丝特回答说。“但是在未来的日子里，他会跟我们手拉手地一起走的。我们会有我们的一个家和壁炉；你呢，将要坐在他的膝头；而他会教给你许多事情，会亲亲热热地爱你。你也会爱他的；不是吗？” </p> 
<p>“那他还会用手捂着心口吗？”珠儿探询着。 </p> 
<p>“傻孩子，这算什么问题啊！”她母亲惊讶地大声说。“过来请脑祝福吧！” </p> 
<p>但是，不知是出于一切受宠的小孩子那种似乎是本能的对危险的对手的妒嫉，还是她那种异想天开的天性又发作了出来，珠儿不肯对牧师表示丝毫好感。只是在她母亲连拉带拽之后，才总算把她领到了他跟前，可她还是往后坠着，脸上还做着怪样，表示她的不情愿；从她还是婴儿时期起，她就会做出各色各样的怪模样，把她那活泼的面容变成一系列的不同表情，每一种表情中都带有一种新的恶作剧。牧师给弄得既难过又尴尬，但他想，一次亲吻或许可以起到一种奇异的效果，让孩子能把他看得亲近些，抱着这样的希望，他弯腰向前，在她的额头上亲了一下。珠儿立刻挣脱她母亲拉着她的手，跑到小溪边上，猫下身子，洗起她的额头，直到那不受欢迎的亲吻完全给洗净，散进潺潺流逝的溪水之中。然后她便远远地呆在一边，默默地望着海丝特和牧师；此时，两个大人正在一起谈着，根据他们很快要去实现的新目标和新处境，做出种种安排。 </p> 
<p>这次命运恢关的会见此时已接近尾声。那小小的山谷将被遗弃在幽暗和古老的树木中间，孤独而寂寞地聆听着那些树木的众多舌头长时间地悄声议论着在这里发生过的不为人知的事情。而这条忧郁的小溪也将在它那已经过于沉重的小小心灵中再加上另一个神秘的故事，它将继续潺潺向前，悄声低语，其音调比起先前的多少世纪绝不会有半点欢快。</p>
