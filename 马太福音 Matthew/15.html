<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then there came to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying, 
<br>15:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 的 门 徒 为 什 么 犯 古 人 的 遗 传 呢 ？ 因 为 吃 饭 的 时 候 ， 他 们 不 洗 手 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Why do your disciples go against the teaching of the fathers? for they take food with unwashed hands. 
<br>15:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 你 们 为 什 么 因 着 你 们 的 遗 传 ， 犯 神 的 诫 命 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And in answer he said to them, Why do you, yourselves, go against the word of God on account of the teaching which has been handed down to you? 
<br>15:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 神 说 ， 当 孝 敬 父 母 。 又 说 ， 咒 骂 父 母 的 ， 必 治 死 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For God said, Give honour to your father and mother: and, He who says evil of father or mother will be put to death. 
<br>15:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 们 倒 说 ， 无 论 何 人 对 父 母 说 ， 我 所 当 奉 给 你 的 ， 已 经 作 了 供 献 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But you say, If a man says to his father or his mother, That by which you might have had profit from me is given to God; 
<br>15:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 就 可 以 不 孝 敬 父 母 。 这 就 是 你 们 借 着 遗 传 ， 废 了 神 的 诫 命 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; There is no need for him to give honour to his father. And you have made the word of God without effect because of your teaching. 
<br>15:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 假 冒 为 善 的 人 哪 ， 以 赛 亚 指 着 你 们 说 的 预 言 ， 是 不 错 的 。 他 说 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; You false ones, well did Isaiah say of you, 
<br>15:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 这 百 姓 用 嘴 唇 尊 敬 我 ， 心 却 远 离 我 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; These people give me honour with their lips, but their heart is far from me. 
<br>15:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 将 人 的 吩 咐 ， 当 作 道 理 教 导 人 ， 所 以 拜 我 也 是 枉 然 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But their worship is to no purpose, while they give as their teaching the rules of men. 
<br>15:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 稣 就 叫 了 众 人 来 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 要 听 ， 也 要 明 白 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he got the people together and said to them, Give ear, and let my words be clear to you: 
<br>15:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 入 口 的 不 能 污 秽 人 ， 出 口 的 乃 能 污 秽 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Not that which goes into the mouth makes a man unclean, but that which comes out of the mouth. 
<br>15:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 当 时 ， 门 徒 进 前 来 对 他 说 ， 法 利 赛 人 听 见 这 话 ， 不 服 ， 你 知 道 吗 ？ （ 不 服 原 文 作 跌 倒 ）&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the disciples came and said to him, Did you see that the Pharisees were troubled when these words came to their ears? 
<br>15:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 凡 栽 种 的 物 ， 若 不 是 我 天 父 栽 种 的 ， 必 要 拔 出 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But he said in answer, Every plant which my Father in heaven has not put in the earth, will be taken up by the roots. 
<br>15:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 任 凭 他 们 吧 。 他 们 是 瞎 眼 领 路 的 。 若 是 瞎 子 领 瞎 子 ， 两 个 人 都 要 掉 在 坑 里 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Let them be: they are blind guides. And if a blind man is guiding a blind man, the two will go falling into a hole together. 
<br>15:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 彼 得 对 耶 稣 说 ， 请 将 这 比 喻 讲 给 我 们 听 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Peter said to him, Make the story clear to us. 
<br>15:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 稣 说 ， 你 们 到 如 今 还 不 明 白 吗 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said, Are you, like them, still without wisdom? 
<br>15:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 岂 不 知 凡 入 口 的 ， 是 运 到 肚 子 里 ， 又 落 在 茅 厕 里 吗 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth goes on into the stomach, and is sent out as waste? 
<br>15:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 惟 独 出 口 的 ， 是 从 心 里 发 出 来 的 ， 这 才 污 秽 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But the things which come out of the mouth come from the heart; and they make a man unclean. 
<br>15:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 因 为 从 心 里 发 出 来 的 ， 有 恶 念 ， 凶 杀 ， 奸 淫 ， 苟 合 ， 偷 盗 ， 妄 证 ， 谤 ？ ？ 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For out of the heart come evil thoughts, the taking of life, broken faith between the married, unclean desires of the flesh, taking of property, false witness, bitter words: 
<br>15:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 这 都 是 污 秽 人 的 。 至 于 不 洗 手 吃 饭 ， 那 却 不 污 秽 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; These are the things which make a man unclean; but to take food with unwashed hands does not make a man unclean. 
<br>15:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 稣 离 开 那 里 ， 退 到 推 罗 西 顿 的 境 内 去 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Jesus went away from there into the country of Tyre and Sidon. 
<br>15:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 有 一 个 迦 南 妇 人 ， 从 那 地 方 出 来 ， 喊 着 说 ， 主 啊 ， 大 卫 的 子 孙 ， 可 怜 我 。 我 女 儿 被 鬼 附 得 甚 苦 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And a woman of Canaan came out from those parts, crying and saying, Have pity on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is greatly troubled with an unclean spirit. 
<br>15:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 稣 却 一 言 不 答 。 门 徒 进 前 来 ， 求 他 说 ， 这 妇 人 在 我 们 后 头 喊 叫 。 请 打 发 她 走 吧 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But he gave her no answer. And his disciples came and said to him, Send her away, for she is crying after us. 
<br>15:24 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 稣 说 ， 我 奉 差 遣 ， 不 过 是 到 以 色 列 家 迷 失 的 羊 那 里 去 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But he made answer and said, I was sent only to the wandering sheep of the house of Israel. 
<br>15:25 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 妇 人 来 拜 他 ， 说 ， 主 啊 ， 帮 助 我 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But she came and gave him worship, saying, Help, Lord. 
<br>15:26 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 回 答 说 ， 不 好 拿 儿 女 的 饼 ， 丢 给 狗 吃 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he made answer and said, It is not right to take the children's bread and give it to the dogs. 
<br>15:27 [hgb]&nbsp; 妇 人 说 ， 主 啊 ， 不 错 。 但 是 狗 也 吃 它 主 人 桌 子 上 掉 下 来 的 碎 渣 儿 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But she said, Yes, Lord: but even the dogs take the bits from under their masters' table. 
<br>15:28 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 稣 说 ， 妇 人 ， 你 的 信 心 是 大 的 。 照 你 所 要 的 ， 给 你 成 全 了 吧 。 从 那 时 候 ， 她 女 儿 就 好 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Jesus, answering, said to her, O woman, great is your faith: let your desire be done. And her daughter was made well from that hour. 
<br>15:29 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 稣 离 开 那 地 方 ， 来 到 靠 近 加 利 利 的 海 边 ， 就 上 山 坐 下 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Jesus went from there and came to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and took his seat there. 
<br>15:30 [hgb]&nbsp; 有 许 多 人 到 他 那 里 ， 带 着 瘸 子 ， 瞎 子 ， 哑 吧 ， 有 残 疾 的 ， 和 好 些 别 的 病 人 ， 都 放 在 他 脚 前 。 他 就 治 好 了 他 们 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And there came to him great numbers of people having with them those who were broken in body, or blind, or without voice, or wounded, or ill in any way, and a number of others; they put them down at his feet and he made them well: 
<br>15:31 [hgb]&nbsp; 甚 至 众 人 都 希 奇 。 因 为 看 见 哑 吧 说 话 ， 残 疾 的 痊 愈 ， 瘸 子 行 走 ， 瞎 子 看 见 ， 他 们 就 归 荣 耀 给 以 色 列 的 神 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So that the people were full of wonder when they saw that those who had no voice were talking, the feeble were made strong, those whose bodies were broken had the power of walking, and the blind were able to see: and they gave glory to the God of Israel. 
<br>15:32 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 稣 叫 门 徒 来 说 ， 我 怜 悯 这 众 人 ， 因 为 他 们 同 我 在 这 里 已 经 三 天 ， 也 没 有 吃 的 了 。 我 不 愿 意 叫 他 们 饿 着 回 去 ， 恐 怕 在 路 上 困 乏 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Jesus got his disciples together and said, I have pity for the people, because they have now been with me three days and have no food: and I will not send them away without food, or they will have no strength for the journey. 
<br>15:33 [hgb]&nbsp; 门 徒 说 ， 我 们 在 这 野 地 ， 哪 里 有 这 么 多 的 饼 ， 叫 这 许 多 人 吃 饱 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the disciples say to him, How may we get enough bread in a waste place, to give food to such a number of people? 
<br>15:34 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 稣 说 ， 你 们 有 多 少 饼 ？ 他 们 说 ， 有 七 个 ， 还 有 几 条 小 鱼 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Jesus says to them, How much bread have you? And they said, Seven cakes, and some small fishes. 
<br>15:35 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 就 吩 咐 众 人 坐 在 地 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then he gave an order to the people to be seated on the earth, 
<br>15:36 [hgb]&nbsp; 拿 着 这 七 个 饼 和 几 条 鱼 ， 祝 谢 了 ， 掰 开 ， 递 给 门 徒 。 门 徒 又 递 给 众 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he took the seven cakes of bread and the fishes; and having given praise, he gave the broken bread to the disciples, and the disciples gave it to the people. 
<br>15:37 [hgb]&nbsp; 众 人 都 吃 并 且 吃 饱 了 。 收 拾 剩 下 的 零 碎 ， 装 满 了 七 个 筐 子 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And they all took food, and had enough; and they took up of the broken bits, seven baskets full. 
<br>15:38 [hgb]&nbsp; 吃 的 人 ， 除 了 妇 女 孩 子 ， 共 有 四 千 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And there were four thousand men who took food, together with women and children. 
<br>15:39 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 稣 叫 众 人 散 去 ， 就 上 船 ， 来 到 马 加 丹 的 境 界 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when he had sent the people away, he got into the boat, and came into the country of Magadan.
