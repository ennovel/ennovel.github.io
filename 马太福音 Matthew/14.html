<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; At that time news of Jesus came to Herod the king; 
<br>14:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 就 对 臣 仆 说 ， 这 是 施 洗 的 约 翰 从 死 里 复 活 ， 所 以 这 些 异 能 从 他 里 面 发 出 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he has come back from the dead, and so these powers are working in him. 
<br>14:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 起 先 希 律 为 他 兄 弟 腓 力 的 妻 子 希 罗 底 的 缘 故 ， 把 约 翰 拿 住 锁 在 监 里 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For Herod had taken John and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. 
<br>14:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 因 为 约 翰 曾 对 他 说 ， 你 娶 这 妇 人 是 不 合 理 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Because John had said to him, It is not right for you to have her. 
<br>14:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 希 律 就 想 要 杀 他 ， 只 是 怕 百 姓 。 因 为 他 们 以 约 翰 为 先 知 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he would have put him to death, but for his fear of the people, because in their eyes John was a prophet. 
<br>14:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 到 了 希 律 的 生 日 ， 希 罗 底 的 女 儿 ， 在 众 人 面 前 跳 舞 ， 使 希 律 欢 喜 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias was dancing before them, and Herod was pleased with her. 
<br>14:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 希 律 就 起 誓 ， 应 许 随 她 所 求 的 给 她 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So he gave her his word with an oath to let her have whatever she might make request for. 
<br>14:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 女 儿 被 母 亲 所 使 ， 就 说 ， 请 把 施 洗 约 翰 的 头 ， 放 在 盘 子 里 拿 来 给 我 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And she, at her mother's suggestion, said, Give me here on a plate the head of John the Baptist. 
<br>14:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 王 便 忧 愁 ， 但 因 他 所 起 的 誓 ， 又 因 同 席 的 人 ， 就 吩 咐 给 她 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the king was sad; but because of his oaths and because of his guests, he gave the order for it to be given to her; 
<br>14:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 打 发 人 去 ， 在 监 里 斩 了 约 翰 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he sent and had John's head cut off in the prison. 
<br>14:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 把 头 放 在 盘 子 里 ， 拿 来 给 了 女 子 。 女 子 拿 去 给 她 母 亲 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And his head was put on a plate and given to the girl; and she took it to her mother. 
<br>14:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 翰 的 门 徒 来 ， 把 尸 首 领 去 ， 埋 葬 了 。 就 去 告 诉 耶 稣 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And his disciples came, and took up his body and put it in the earth; and they went and gave Jesus news of what had taken place. 
<br>14:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 稣 听 见 了 ， 就 上 船 从 那 里 独 自 退 到 野 地 里 去 。 众 人 听 见 ， 就 从 各 城 里 步 行 跟 随 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now when it came to the ears of Jesus, he went away from there in a boat, to a waste place by himself: and the people hearing of it, went after him on foot from the towns. 
<br>14:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 稣 出 来 ， 见 有 许 多 的 人 ， 就 怜 悯 他 们 ， 治 好 了 他 们 的 病 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he came out and saw a great number of people and he had pity on them, and made well those of them who were ill. 
<br>14:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 天 将 晚 的 时 候 ， 门 徒 进 前 来 说 ， 这 是 野 地 ， 时 候 已 经 过 了 。 请 叫 众 人 散 开 ， 他 们 好 往 村 子 里 去 ， 自 己 买 吃 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when evening had come, the disciples came to him, saying, This place is waste land, and the time is now past; send the people away so that they may go into the towns and get themselves food. 
<br>14:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 稣 说 ， 不 用 他 们 去 ， 你 们 给 他 们 吃 吧 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But Jesus said to them, There is no need for them to go away; give them food yourselves. 
<br>14:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 门 徒 说 ， 我 们 这 里 只 有 五 个 饼 ， 两 条 鱼 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And they say to him, We have here but five cakes of bread and two fishes. 
<br>14:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 稣 说 ， 拿 过 来 给 我 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; He said, Bring them hither to me. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said, Give them to me. 
<br>14:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 吩 咐 众 人 坐 在 草 地 上 。 就 拿 着 这 五 个 饼 ， 两 条 鱼 ， 望 着 天 ， 祝 福 ， 掰 开 饼 ， 递 给 门 徒 。 门 徒 又 递 给 众 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he gave orders for the people to be seated on the grass; and he took the five cakes of bread and the two fishes and, looking up to heaven, he said words of blessing, and made division of the food, and gave it to the disciples, and the disciples gave it to the people. 
<br>14:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 都 吃 ， 并 且 吃 饱 了 。 把 剩 下 的 零 碎 收 拾 起 来 ， 装 满 了 十 二 个 篮 子 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And they all took of the food and had enough: and they took up twelve baskets full of broken bits which were not used. 
<br>14:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 吃 的 人 ， 除 了 妇 女 孩 子 ， 约 有 五 千 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And those who had food were about five thousand men, in addition to women and children. 
<br>14:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 稣 随 即 催 门 徒 上 船 ， 先 渡 到 那 边 去 ， 等 他 叫 众 人 散 开 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And straight away he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, till he had sent the people away. 
<br>14:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 散 了 众 人 以 后 ， 他 就 独 自 上 山 去 祷 告 。 到 了 晚 上 ， 只 有 他 一 人 在 那 里 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And after he had sent the people away, he went up into the mountain by himself for prayer: and when evening was come, he was there by himself. 
<br>14:24 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 时 船 在 海 中 ， 因 风 不 顺 ， 被 浪 摇 撼 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, and was troubled by the waves: for the wind was against them. 
<br>14:25 [hgb]&nbsp; 夜 里 四 更 天 ， 耶 稣 在 海 面 上 走 ， 往 门 徒 那 里 去 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. 
<br>14:26 [hgb]&nbsp; 门 徒 看 见 他 在 海 面 上 走 ， 就 惊 慌 了 ， 说 ， 是 个 鬼 怪 。 便 害 怕 ， 喊 叫 起 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when they saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they gave cries of fear. 
<br>14:27 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 稣 连 忙 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 放 心 。 是 我 ， 不 要 怕 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But straight away Jesus said to them, Take heart; it is I, have no fear. 
<br>14:28 [hgb]&nbsp; 彼 得 说 ， 主 ， 如 果 是 你 ， 请 叫 我 从 水 面 上 走 到 你 那 里 去 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Peter, answering, said to him, Lord, if it is you, give me the order to come to you on the water. 
<br>14:29 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 稣 说 ， 你 来 吧 。 彼 得 就 从 船 上 下 去 ， 在 水 面 上 走 ， 要 到 耶 稣 那 里 去 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said, Come. And Peter got out of the boat, and walking on the water, went to Jesus. 
<br>14:30 [hgb]&nbsp; 只 因 见 风 甚 大 ， 就 害 怕 。 将 要 沉 下 去 ， 便 喊 着 说 ， 主 阿 ， 救 我 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But when he saw the wind he was in fear and, starting to go down, he gave a cry, saying, Help, Lord. 
<br>14:31 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 稣 赶 紧 伸 手 拉 住 他 ， 说 ， 你 这 小 信 的 人 哪 ， 为 什 么 疑 惑 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And straight away Jesus put out his hand and took a grip of him, and said to him, O man of little faith, why were you in doubt? 
<br>14:32 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 上 了 船 ， 风 就 住 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when they had got into the boat, the wind went down. 
<br>14:33 [hgb]&nbsp; 在 船 上 的 人 都 拜 他 说 ， 你 真 是 神 的 儿 子 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And those who were in the boat gave him worship, saying, Truly you are the Son of God. 
<br>14:34 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 过 了 海 ， 来 到 革 尼 撒 勒 地 方 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when they had gone across, they came to land at Gennesaret. 
<br>14:35 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 里 的 人 ， 一 认 出 是 耶 稣 ， 就 打 发 人 到 周 围 地 方 去 ， 把 所 有 的 病 人 ， 带 到 他 那 里 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when the men of that place had news of him, they sent into all the country round about, and took to him all who were ill, 
<br>14:36 [hgb]&nbsp; 只 求 耶 稣 准 他 们 摸 他 的 衣 裳 ？ ？ 子 ， 摸 着 的 人 ， 就 都 好 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; With the request that they might only put their hands on the edge of his robe: and all those who did so were made well.
