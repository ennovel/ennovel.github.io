<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now late on the Sabbath, when the dawn of the first day of the week was near, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the place where his body was. 
<br>28:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 忽 然 地 大 震 动 。 因 为 有 主 的 使 者 ， 从 天 上 下 来 ， 把 石 头 滚 开 ， 坐 在 上 面 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And there was a great earth-shock; for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, rolling back the stone, took his seat on it. 
<br>28:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 的 像 貌 如 同 闪 电 ， 衣 服 洁 白 如 雪 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; His form was shining like the light, and his clothing was white as snow: 
<br>28:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 看 守 的 人 ， 就 因 他 吓 得 浑 身 乱 战 ， 甚 至 和 死 人 一 样 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And for fear of him the watchmen were shaking, and became as dead men. 
<br>28:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 天 使 对 妇 女 说 ， 不 要 害 怕 ， 我 知 道 你 们 是 寻 找 那 钉 十 字 架 的 耶 稣 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the angel said to the women, Have no fear: for I see that you are searching for Jesus, who was put to death on the cross. 
<br>28:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 不 在 这 里 ， 照 他 所 说 的 ， 已 经 复 活 了 。 你 们 来 看 安 放 主 的 地 方 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; He is not here, for he has come to life again, even as he said. Come, see the Lord's resting-place. 
<br>28:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 快 去 告 诉 他 的 门 徒 ， 说 他 从 死 里 复 活 了 ， 并 且 在 你 们 以 先 往 加 利 利 去 ， 在 那 里 你 们 要 见 他 。 看 哪 ， 我 已 经 告 诉 你 们 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And go quickly and give his disciples the news that he has come back from the dead, and is going before you into Galilee; there you will see him, as I have said to you. 
<br>28:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 妇 女 们 就 急 忙 离 开 坟 墓 ， 又 害 怕 ， 又 大 大 地 欢 喜 ， 跑 去 要 报 给 他 的 门 徒 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And they went away quickly, with fear and great joy, to give his disciples the news. 
<br>28:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 忽 然 耶 稣 遇 见 她 们 ， 说 ， 愿 你 们 平 安 。 她 们 就 上 前 抱 住 他 的 脚 拜 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And on the way, Jesus came to them, saying, Be glad. And they came and put their hands on his feet, and gave him worship. 
<br>28:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 稣 对 她 们 说 ， 不 要 害 怕 ， 你 们 去 告 诉 我 的 弟 兄 ， 叫 他 们 往 加 利 利 去 ， 在 那 里 必 见 我 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then said Jesus to them, Have no fear: go and give word to my brothers to go into Galilee, and there they will see me. 
<br>28:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 去 的 时 候 ， 看 守 的 兵 ， 有 几 个 进 城 去 ， 将 所 经 历 的 事 ， 都 报 给 祭 司 长 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now, while they were going, some of the watchmen came into the town and gave news to the chief priests of all the things which had taken place. 
<br>28:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 祭 司 长 和 长 老 聚 集 商 议 ， 就 拿 许 多 银 钱 给 兵 丁 说 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when they had come together with those in authority, and had made their decision, they gave much money to the watchmen, saying, 
<br>28:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 们 要 这 样 说 ， 夜 间 我 们 睡 觉 的 时 候 ， 他 的 门 徒 来 把 他 偷 去 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Say, His disciples came by night and took him away secretly while we were sleeping. 
<br>28:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 倘 若 这 话 被 巡 抚 听 见 ， 有 我 们 劝 他 ， 保 你 们 无 事 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And if this comes to the ruler's ears, we will see that he does not make you responsible. 
<br>28:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 兵 丁 受 了 银 钱 ， 就 照 所 嘱 咐 他 们 的 去 行 。 这 话 就 传 说 在 犹 太 人 中 间 ， 直 到 今 日 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So they took the money, and did as they had been ordered: and this account has been current among the Jews till the present time. 
<br>28:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 十 一 个 门 徒 往 加 利 利 去 ， 到 了 耶 稣 约 定 的 山 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had given them orders to go. 
<br>28:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 见 了 耶 稣 就 拜 他 。 然 而 还 有 人 疑 惑 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when they saw him they gave him worship: but some were in doubt. 
<br>28:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 稣 进 前 来 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 天 上 ， 地 下 所 有 的 权 柄 ， 都 赐 给 我 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Jesus came to them and said, All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. 
<br>28:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 所 以 你 们 要 去 ， 使 万 民 作 我 的 门 徒 ， 奉 父 子 圣 灵 的 名 ， 给 他 们 施 洗 。 （ 或 作 给 他 们 施 洗 归 于 父 子 圣 灵 的 名 ）&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Go then, and make disciples of all the nations, giving them baptism in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit: 
<br>28:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 凡 我 所 吩 咐 你 们 的 ， 都 教 训 他 们 遵 守 ， 我 就 常 与 你 们 同 在 ， 直 到 世 界 的 末 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Teaching them to keep all the rules which I have given you: and see, I am ever with you, even to the end of the world.
