GILBERT GETS A PLACE.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      The next morning, about eight o’clock, the family were gathered about the breakfast-table. Randolph was ten minutes late. He came in looking sleepy and cross.
<br> 
<br> “Randolph,” said his father, “what made you so late last evening?”
<br> 
<br> “I wasn’t late.”
<br> 
<br> “You may not call half-past eleven late; I do.”
<br> 
<br> “It wasn’t more than half-past ten when I came in.”
<br> 
<br> “You are quite mistaken. I looked at my watch when I heard you coming upstairs.”
<br> 
<br> “It was rather late; but you needn’t make such a fuss about it, Mr. Briggs,” said his wife. “You have been out later than that yourself.”
<br> 
<br> “Whenever I have been late, I had a good reason 78for it. Besides, there is some difference in age between Randolph and myself.”
<br> 
<br> “At any rate, you needn’t scold him before a stranger.”
<br> 
<br> “I do not consider Gilbert a stranger. Besides, what I say is partly meant for him. It is not wise for any boy of his or Randolph’s age to remain out till nearly twelve.”
<br> 
<br> “I hope you are almost through; I am getting tired of the subject.”
<br> 
<br> Thus Mrs. Briggs gave Randolph indirect encouragement, by taking his part against his father.
<br> 
<br> Mr. Briggs shrugged his shoulders and was silent. Gilbert felt rather uncomfortable.
<br> 
<br> “Will you have some more coffee?” asked Mrs. Briggs, in an icy tone.
<br> 
<br> “No, thank you,” he said.
<br> 
<br> “You may go down-town with me, Gilbert,” said Mr. Briggs. “I will introduce you to a gentleman who will possibly give you a place.”
<br> 
<br> “Thank you, sir.”
<br> 
<br> 79“I hope, Mr. Briggs, you will bear in mind what I said last night,” said his wife.
<br> 
<br> She referred to his getting a boarding-place for Gilbert.
<br> 
<br> “I have not forgotten it,” he answered.
<br> 
<br> Gilbert and his guardian took a University Place car, and they rode down-town together.
<br> 
<br> Mr. Briggs obtained a seat, but Gilbert was compelled to stand, on account of the crowded state of the car.
<br> 
<br> Seated beside Mr. Briggs was a business man of about his own age.
<br> 
<br> “Good-morning, Mr. Sands,” he said, for it was an acquaintance.
<br> 
<br> “Good-morning, Mr. Briggs. Is this young man your son?”
<br> 
<br> “No, he is under my charge, however. I have a son of about his age.”
<br> 
<br> “Is he at school?”
<br> 
<br> “He has been till recently. I am looking for a place for him at present. It is time he commenced his business education.”
<br> 
<br> 80“Indeed,” said the gentleman, thoughtfully. “Are you thinking of any business in particular?”
<br> 
<br> “No. I shall accept any good opening for him.”
<br> 
<br> “The fact is,” said Sands, “I am looking for a boy to enter my own office. I was compelled yesterday to dismiss one who had been with me for six months, on account of dishonesty. I found he appropriated revenue-stamps, and sold them. I don’t know how long this has been going on, but probably I have been a considerable loser.”
<br> 
<br> “I don’t think you will have any such difficulty with Gilbert, if you are inclined to take him,” said Mr. Briggs.
<br> 
<br> “I like his appearance, and will take him at once, if you say so. I have been in the habit of paying five dollars a week.”
<br> 
<br> “It is as much as I expected him to earn for the present. Gilbert, this gentleman is willing to give you a place in his office.”
<br> 
<br> Gilbert had already formed a favorable opinion of Mr. Sands and he answered promptly, “I am very 81much obliged to him, and shall be glad to be in his employ.”
<br> 
<br> Mr. Sands looked pleased.
<br> 
<br> “May I ask what is your business, sir?” continued Gilbert.
<br> 
<br> “I am a broker; my office is at No. — Wall Street.”
<br> 
<br> “I am afraid you will find me very ignorant of business,” said Gilbert; “but I hope to learn rapidly.”
<br> 
<br> “There is nothing that will puzzle you at first. If you remain any length of time, there will be something to learn.”
<br> 
<br> “I have assured Mr. Sands,” said Mr. Briggs, “that he can rely upon your honesty. His last boy was discharged for lack of that very necessary quality.”
<br> 
<br> “I don’t think he will be disappointed in me, so far as that goes,” said Gilbert, proudly.
<br> 
<br> “I don’t think I shall,” said the broker, upon whom Gilbert’s modest but manly bearing had produced a very favorable impression. “When shall you be ready to go to work?”
<br> 
<br> 82“At any time, sir.”
<br> 
<br> “Does that mean to-day?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, sir.”
<br> 
<br> “I will stipulate, however,” said Mr. Briggs, “that Gilbert may be released at four o’clock. I want to select a boarding-place for him, and that will give me time.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, certainly,” said the broker. “I can let him go earlier if you desire it.”
<br> 
<br> “No, it will not be necessary; I shall not myself be at leisure till that hour. You know my place of business, Gilbert, do you not?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, sir; I have been there already, you know.”
<br> 
<br> “I remember. Very well, go with Mr. Sands to his office, and come to me at four this afternoon.”
<br> 
<br> “Very well, sir.”
<br> 
<br> It seemed rather strange to Gilbert to find himself already in a situation. The transition from life at school had been very sudden. On the whole he was not sorry for it. It kindled his ambition to think that he was going to make himself useful; that he was to have a part in the busy scene around him. 83He only regretted that for some time to come he could not hope to earn his living entirely; that for two or three years, perhaps, he was to be a source of expense to his guardian.
<br> 
<br> “I will be as economical as I can,” he thought. “I will cost him as little as possible, and when I am older I will pay back every cent I owe him, if I am lucky enough to have the means.”
<br> 
<br> Had Gilbert only known it, it was Mr. Briggs who was heavily in his debt, and the small sum which would be allowed him to help defray his expenses was already his own. It was just as well that he did not know it. It was better that he should feel entirely dependent upon his own exertions for support. To an active and ambitious boy it is a stimulus and an incentive to effort.
<br> 
<br> “What is your whole name, Gilbert?” asked Mr. Sands, pleasantly.
<br> 
<br> “Gilbert Greyson, sir.”
<br> 
<br> “You have been at school until recently, Mr. Briggs tells me.”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, sir.”
<br> 
<br> 84“In the city?”
<br> 
<br> “No, sir; I was at Dr. Burton’s classical school, in the town of Westville.”
<br> 
<br> “I have heard of it. Did you pursue a classical course?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, sir.”
<br> 
<br> “Then you know something of Latin and Greek?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, sir. In a year I should have been ready for Yale College.”
<br> 
<br> “Then you already have more than an average education.”
<br> 
<br> “I hoped to have a better, sir.”
<br> 
<br> “You need not stop learning because you left school. It happens that I, myself, pursued a course similar to yours, and left my studies for business when nearly ready for college.”
<br> 
<br> “Indeed, sir?” said Gilbert, interested.
<br> 
<br> “But I still keep up my Latin a little. Greek I have pretty much forgotten.”
<br> 
<br> By this time they had reached the office of Mr. Sands. It was not large, but was neat and well furnished. A clerk was at a desk, engaged in writing. 85There was, besides, in waiting a boy of about Gilbert’s age, who apparently wished to speak to Mr. Sands.
<br> 
<br> “You here, John?” demanded Mr. Sands.
<br> 
<br> “Yes, sir,” whined the boy. “Won’t you take me back, sir?”
<br> 
<br> The broker shook his head.
<br> 
<br> “No, I cannot,” he said. “You have deceived me, and I cannot trust you.”
<br> 
<br> “I won’t do it again, sir.”
<br> 
<br> “I could not take you back now if I would,” said the broker. “I have engaged this boy in your place.”
<br> 
<br> John scowled at Gilbert with a sense of personal injury, and left the office.
