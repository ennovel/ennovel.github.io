EMMA’S FATHER.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      Gilbert kept on his way with the little girl. After a short walk, she paused in front of a miserable tenement house on Pearl Street.
<br> 
<br> “This is where we live,” she said; “will you go upstairs, sir?”
<br> 
<br> “If you think I shall not be intruding on your father,” said Gilbert, with instinctive delicacy.
<br> 
<br> “He will be glad to see a kind face,” said Emma, simply.
<br> 
<br> “Then if you will lead the way, I will follow,” said our hero.
<br> 
<br> They clambered up three flights of stairs, and then Emma opened a door and ushered her companion into a small, barely furnished room. On a pallet on the floor was stretched a man of fifty, pale and emaciated, 223with eyes preternaturally bright; his face was turned towards the wall, and he did not see Gilbert.
<br> 
<br> “Is that you, Emma?” he asked.
<br> 
<br> “Yes, papa; how do you feel now?” asked the little girl.
<br> 
<br> “Much the same, my child; did you sell your flowers?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, papa, and I have brought you a fresh roll. I have brought some one with me, too.”
<br> 
<br> Mr. Talbot turned his head, and looked at Gilbert, not without surprise.
<br> 
<br> “I hope you won’t look upon me as an intruder, sir,” said Gilbert; “your little girl told me you would not, or I would not have ventured to call.”
<br> 
<br> “I am glad to see you,” said the sick man, “though this is but a poor place to receive company in.”
<br> 
<br> “I understand your situation, sir,” said Gilbert; “you have been sick and unfortunate.”
<br> 
<br> “You are right; I was unfortunate first, and sick afterwards. Emma, will you give the young gentleman a chair?”
<br> 
<br> 224“Oh, don’t trouble yourself,” said Gilbert, taking a chair for himself.
<br> 
<br> Mr. Talbot proceeded: “Five years since, I removed to Chicago, with my little girl, in the hope that in that growing and prosperous Western city I might, at least, earn a comfortable living. I was not wholly without means,—I had about a thousand dollars,—but misfortune pursued me. I was once burnt out, lost my situation by the failure of the firm that employed me, and the end of it all was, that a year ago I found myself bankrupt. Then I decided to come to New York, hoping to succeed better here. I managed, while I was well, to earn a precarious living by copying for lawyers (I am a book-keeper by vocation) but, a month since, I was stricken down by a fever, from which I am only just recovering. How we have got along I can hardly tell you. When I became sick I had but a dollar in my pocket-book, yet we have continued to live. My little Emma,” he continued, looking proudly at the little girl, “has been a great help to me. She has managed to earn a 225little, and has attended upon me by night and by day. I don’t know what I could have done without her.”
<br> 
<br> “I ought to work for you now, papa,” said the child, simply; “all my life you have been working for me.”
<br> 
<br> “She is a perfect little woman, though only ten years old,” said the father. “Poor child! her life has been far from bright. I hope the future has some happier days in store for both of us.”
<br> 
<br> “Only get well, sir,” said Gilbert, cheerfully, “and the happier days will begin.”
<br> 
<br> “I hope so; but even in health I found it hard to get along.”
<br> 
<br> At this moment there was a knock at the door.
<br> 
<br> Emma went to the door, and opened it.
<br> 
<br> A short, stout, coarse-featured woman entered, and looked about her with the air of one who had come to engage in battle.
<br> 
<br> “Take a seat, Mrs. Flanders,” said the sick man.
<br> 
<br> “Much obliged to you, sir,” said the woman, not to be placated by this politeness; “but I can’t stop. I come on business. I suppose you know what it is.”
<br> 
<br> 226“I suppose it is the rent,” said Mr. Talbot, uneasily.
<br> 
<br> “Yes, it is the rent,” said Mrs. Flanders. “I hope you are ready to pay it.”
<br> 
<br> “How can you expect it, Mrs. Flanders? You know how long I have been sick and unable to earn anything.”
<br> 
<br> “That is not my fault, Mr. Talbot,” said the woman, sharply. “I’m a widow woman, and have to look out for myself. When I let you this room, I told you you must pay me prompt, for I had to pay prompt. Have you forgot that?”
<br> 
<br> “No, I have not forgotten it, and I am very sorry that circumstances have been so against me. Wait patiently, and I will pay you yet.”
<br> 
<br> “Wait patiently!” repeated the woman, angrily. “Haven’t I been waiting patiently for a month? To-morrow I have to pay my rent, and I must be paid what you owe me.”
<br> 
<br> “We have but a few cents in the house,” said Mr. Talbot. “How much have you got, Emma?”
<br> 
<br> “Four cents, papa.”
<br> 
<br> 227“Give them to Mrs. Flanders; it is all we have.”
<br> 
<br> “Four cents!” exclaimed the landlady, shrilly; “do you mean to insult me?”
<br> 
<br> “I don’t feel much like insulting anybody,” said Mr. Talbot, wearily.
<br> 
<br> “Once more, do you intend to pay me my rent or not?” demanded the virago.
<br> 
<br> “I can’t at present. In time—”
<br> 
<br> “Stuff and nonsense!—then out you budge to-day. I can’t afford to keep you here for nothing.”
<br> 
<br> “O Mrs. Flanders,” pleaded Emma, in terror. “It will kill my father to go out, sick as he is. Let us stay here a little longer.”
<br> 
<br> “It won’t do,” said the woman; “I’m not so soft as that comes to. If you won’t pay the rent, you must budge.”
<br> 
<br> Gilbert had listened to this dialogue with mingled pain and indignation. It was his first practical acquaintance with poverty and the world’s inhumanity. He could remain silent no longer.
<br> 
<br> “How much is your bill, madam?” he asked.
<br> 
<br> 228“Rent for four weeks, at a dollar a week,—four dollars.”
<br> 
<br> “I will pay it,” said Gilbert, glad that the amount was not beyond his resources.
<br> 
<br> The little girl impulsively seized his hand and carried it to her lips.
<br> 
<br> “Oh, how kind you are!” she said.
<br> 
<br> “Are you sure it will not inconvenience you?” asked Mr. Talbot.
<br> 
<br> “Oh, no, sir.”
<br> 
<br> “Then I will accept the loan with thanks. You are a friend in need.”
<br> 
<br> The landlady took the money with avidity, for she had considered the debt a bad one.
<br> 
<br> “Thank you, young man,” she said; adding, in an apologetic tone, “You may think me hard, but I have to be. I have to live myself.”
<br> 
<br> Gilbert listened coldly, for he was disgusted with the woman’s coarse and brutal manners.
<br> 
<br> “And I hope you’ll get well soon, sir,” she said, turning to Mr. Talbot; but he did not answer her.
<br> 
<br> “It is the way of the world,” he remarked, after 229Mrs. Flanders had gone out. “Poverty has few friends.”
<br> 
<br> “When you are well, sir, I will mention you to a friend who may give you some work,” said Gilbert. “Meanwhile I will call again in a day or two.”
<br> 
<br> “You will always be welcome,” said Mr. Talbot, gratefully. “You have done me a great service.”
<br> 
<br> When Gilbert went out, he realized that his generosity might cause him inconvenience, for he had but a dollar remaining in his pocket-book, and was earning nothing.
