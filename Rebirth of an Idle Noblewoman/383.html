</p><p>Editor:&nbsp;</p><p>EndlessFantasy TranslationTan Yongsi stared at the egg intently, her eyes unblinking as she watched the little red head pecking its way out of the shell little by little.This egg had been by her side for more than ten years already, being with her since she was very young. Tan Yongsi had never expected that this egg would actually still be alive?!The flaming little red bird pecked its way out its shell, then started to peck on the remaining shell, shoving it into its beak.Tan Yongsi had almost forgotten to breathe, until the little bird on the table turned its head to look at her. Its eyes were round and black like black beans, and she felt her heart melt at the sight of it.“Yi… Yichen?” Ye Xuan, who was already on her bed, getting ready to apply a mask to her face, suddenly caught sight of this miraculous scene. “Am I dreaming?”Xiao Yichen had just received an offline message, when she turned her head to look at what Ye Xuan was staring at. The flaming bird at Tan Yongsi’s side chose this moment to turn its head, staring straight at her.Bang!Xiao Yichen jumped in her seat, staring at the bird with shock and surprise on her face.“Yichen, Yichen?” Ye Xuan was even more surprised to see the usually calm Xiao Yichen having such a big reaction.Xiao Yichen finally snapped out of her daze, touching her bangs lightly. “It’s nothing.”Tan Yongsi carefully picked up the bird. It was an extremely beautiful bird, its red feathers like a bright, dazzling flame.[Party] I’m A Goat, Not A Dog: Yearning? Yearning? Where are you?![Party] Soft Release Of Yearning: Sorry, something happened just now.[Party] I’m Not An Egg: It’s fine. Let’s go.Tan Yongsi placed the bird back on the table, her fingers clicking away on the keyboard. The character on screen in an ordinary robe dodged a few traps deftly, and they finally arrived at the final boss room.Xiao Yichen was standing behind her now, and couldn’t help but exclaimed in praise, “Sisi, your technique is just too beautiful!”[Party] I’m Not An Egg: Last hit![Party] Sakura Baby: Wah, Brother Egg God, are you referring to me?A loli character in pink clothes was dangling in front of a white-clothed character. This person was obviously messing around. A smooth mission was thrown into a mess by her, even if they were a patient person, their life would be shortened by one-tenth by her antics![Party] I’m A Goat, Not A Dog: Sakura Baby, what are you doing? You’re pulling the entire enmity towards us!At this moment, the screen emitted a strong white light!The girl clad in green robes released an ultimate move!The last bit of the health bar above the boss’ head dropped to zero immediately!The game released an announcement that could be seen across the entire server!“Yearning’s just a bit lacking in her equipment. If she were to change to higher-tier gear, will we even still be second and third on the rankings?”“After going through so many teams, the safest in the end is still to be in the same team as Egg God and Goddess Yearning!”“The three servers are going to merge soon, better shine the shoes of these two while you still can. Don’t forget those in Server 1, even a smurf account is enough to wipe us all…”***At the same time, on the top floor of the Nine Heavens building in the Imperial Capital.“Young Master Rui, you’re playing games as soon as you get back, what’s happening?” If you were to talk about which place had the best computer equipment, Nine Heavens’ studio would be in second place, with no one daring to take the first place. Yu Ning raised an eyebrow and was looking at Jiang Yirui, who was sitting in front of the computer.“Huh, this person’s operation of the character ain’t half bad…” When Yu Ning saw that ultimate move on screen, he was surprised. “Even in our studio, there are only a few people who can reach this level of hand speed!”Seeing Jiang Yirui glancing at him, Yu Ning rubbed his chin thoughtfully. Then he looked at Jiang Yirui, his eyes sparkling. “Is it a friend of yours? You can try recruiting them into Nine Heavens, we haven’t got any fresh blood for a while in the web development department!”Jiang Yirui leaned back against the chair he was in, his entire posture screaming lazy. He picked up his cup of tea, lifting the lid to place it aside. If you were to put a robe on him, he would look no different than someone from ancient times. “An online friend who I talk to more than others, not to say I’m very familiar with them. But if I have the chance, I’ll pass on the message.”Yu Ning understood the meaning behind his words. Those who were close to Jiang Yirui, which one of them weren’t monsters from the ancient martial arts world?However, for someone outside the ancient martial arts world to be able to get along with Jiang Yirui, they must be extraordinary! He had to dig some information out!When he thought about it, Yu Ning touched his chin and looked at Jiang Yirui. He had watched the young man in front of him grow up, and apart from Gu Xiqiao, he had never seen such a genius like Jiang Yirui. When Jiang Yirui had first returned to the ancient martial arts world, the first thing he did was to dig out a bunch of unofficial history to study.He had only been three years old at that time!Forget about how he could already read fluently at the age of three, how could he even fluently read the ancient Chinese characters that only a handful of people knew how to?Those geniuses from the ancient martial arts world really were a different breed than the rest.Fortunately, the ancient martial arts world had already once seen the terrifying force that was Gu Xiqiao. Otherwise, they probably would have been shocked to death by a kid who barely reached their waist.“Oh, that’s right.” Yu Ning had initially planned to head out, but stopped suddenly in his tracks. “Uncle Mu has someone send a batch of antiques over yesterday. They’re all from the Warring States Period, and it’s all in Miss Gu’s apartment…”Before he could even finish his sentence, the young man on the chair had disappeared.Yu Ning sweat dropped.***On the other side, Tan Yongsi had turned off her computer once the loot had been distributed. She went to sit on her bed, looking at the red little bird in her palm.“Sisi!” The entrance to the dorm room was opened at this moment, and a beautiful woman in a white lab coat walked in. “Are you okay?”“I’m fine.” It took Tan Yongsi a while to realize what Meng Yunzhao was talking about, and she smiled and replied to her.Meng Yunzhao was most likely talking about the matter with Yan Han. She and Yan Han had been dating for five years, and it was something everyone in the room knew.Seeing her in this state, the entire dorm room descended into silence, none of them actually believing her words.“I’m really fine, it’s just that I owe him money now,” Tan Yongsi said, breaking the silence as she looked at her three friends who were silent. “I still owe Yan Han 100,000.”“I’ll lend you the money.” Xiao Yichen said after some thought. “You can pay me back later.”“No need.” Tan Yongsi waved her hand dismissively.Xiao Yichen was well aware of Tan Yongsi’s attitude, and she thought a bit more before a sparkle entered her eyes. “Sisi, you know how to read feng shui, right?”“A little.” Tan Yongsi&nbsp;nodded. “Why, are you going to introduce me to some business?”“That’s right.” Xiao Yichen smiled. “Our family just moved to the capital recently, and an expert had once told us there’s a small problem in the feng shui of our house. I’ve been looking for a feng shui master to look at it for a while, how about it? Go back home with me tomorrow?”“Are you serious?” Tan Yongsi was startled.Xiao Yichen nodded her head. “Of course. Compared to those two face feng shui masters, I rather have more faith in you.”When the four of them had first entered A University, almost none of them had talked in the room except for Ye Xuan. The others were all cold, and the most mysterious of them all was Tan Yongsi. She had arrived at the university alone, a box in her arm, no family member in sight.Tan Yongsi had slapped a compass on the table, looking at them. “It’s fate that brought us all to live together here. So, do you both want to let me do a reading on your life?”To be honest, when Tan Yongsi had spoken about her family situation, Xiao Yichen had wondered if she had ulterior motives behind her words.But now, there was naturally no doubt after getting along for quite a while. Because of that, they were also well aware of each others’ situation, and that was also the reason for them to gather back here so quickly after they had heard of what happened with Yan Han.“Alright, then I’ll go with you tomorrow to take a look.” Tan Yongsi had not wanted to agree initially, but after looking carefully at Xiao Yichen’s face, she changed her mind.“Okay, I’ll give my great-grandfather a call right now!” Xiao Yichen’s eyes lit up at her friend’s answer.Ye Xuan immediately gestured with her hand to pause. “Hey, wait, Xiao Yichen, great-grandfather? May I ask about your great-grandfather’s longevity?”“Sure, he’s 105 years old.”Ye Xuan: “…”The next day, Tan Yongsi woke up early and meditated with the sun on her face for half an hour. No one else saw, but when she breathed in deeply, wisps of purple mist lingered around her.Half an hour later, she took her meal card and headed towards the cafeteria of A University.“Isn’t that Young Master Yan’s girlfriend?” A group of people suddenly appeared in front of her, blocking her way. The girl who was in the lead wore a high ponytail, strands of her hair dyed purple.Standing next to this ponytail girl was the current year’s medicine faculty’s flower. Her hair was curly and maroon in color, and it was the same girl that had seen Tan Yongsi yesterday. “What girlfriend? Hasn’t Young Master Yan gotten engaged with Miss Wen from the Wen family? The Wen family is one of the big families in the capital! It’s not a family that any Tom Dick and Harry can compare to!”This remark turned a lot of eyes towards them.Yan Han, or Young Master Yan was a name that was quite famous in the Imperial Capital, especially in A University. That’s because he had graduated from A University!Apart from the newer students, everyone else had heard Yan Han’s name at least once in their student life here, especially because Yan Han had recently gotten into a cooperation deal with Nine Heavens, which brought their already prestigious family up another level. To the point that even the Wen family rushed in to offer their daughter as a marriage partner to them.No one expected that Tan Yongsi, who was usually so quiet would turn out to be Yan Han’s girlfriend?!But when this matter had just gotten out, then news of them breaking up also followed almost immediately? Not only did they break up, but news of the engagement between the Yan and Wen family was also soon released!At this time, Tan Yongsi became the biggest joke under the sky.The Wen family was a family that lords over all supreme power in the Imperial Capital.Tan Yongsi was just an ordinary student with nothing to her name.Everyone knew how this would end.“That’s right, I heard that you’ve been dating Young Master Yan for five years. Yan Han has such deep love for you, he even drove all the way here for you.” The girl with the ponytail smiled maliciously. “What, he didn’t cancel the engagement for you?”There wasn’t any lack of things happening that would make everyone hit you when you’re down, and all these people were not any different, all gathering here just to make a dig at Tan Yongsi.Although Tan Yongsi had been given the title of campus belle, she had always been low-key. Except for attending the necessary classes, you wouldn’t be able to find her shadow. Most of the time, you could only see her at her part-time jobs. She didn’t seem to care about the ranking for the flowers in the school either. Something that many girls worked so hard and fought for, seemed like something she had gotten easily with just a wave of her hands. How could this not make others angry?A girl who was from god-knows-where, did she really think that she was that valuable?They also needed to let her know what her place was!“Sis…” A short-haired girl that was standing next to the ponytail haired girl seemed to have read something, and her mouth was opened wide. She tugged on the other girl’s clothes to get her attention.“What is it?” The ponytail hair girl was about to give Tan Yongsi the best tongue lashing in all history of A University and a lesson on social rankings. To be interrupted at this same moment, she was obviously irritated.“Sis, this…” The short-haired girl shrank a little backward, but put out her phone, offering it to the ponytail girl. “The engagement, it’s been canceled…”The engagement has been canceled?!Impossible!The ponytail girl snatched the phone from the other girl, scrolling it to read the news that had been recently updated. “Young Master Yan’s high-profile cancellation of the engagement banquet!”Seeing this news, the ponytail girl looked up at the girl that was standing opposite her, her face turning red and green from anger!Tan Yongsi hadn’t said a single word since this started, and it looked like the ponytail girl had basically dug her own grave and embarrassed herself!“We’re leaving!” She waved her hand, and led the group of girls away with a dark expression.No matter what Yan Han had intended to do with his actions, Tan Yongsi was stunned and rooted to the spot once she heard that.The people who had gathered around in a hurry, left in the same manner that they had come.The engagement was canceled? What was Yan Han thinking? Tan Yongsi stood in the same spot for a while longer, but she couldn’t think of anything that would explain Yan Han’s actions. She didn’t stay for long, leaving to head towards an antique shop beside A University.There were a lot of people on the antique street as usual, and Tan Yongsi found a store that no one really frequent. There were various exquisite gourds of various sizes. Although they looked exquisite, most of them were made of iron and not worth adding to your collection.She bought ten items for a hundred yuan, and the stall owner gave her a crooked smile.If the stall owner were to know that she had just bought tens of thousands worth of goods for only a hundred yuan, he would definitely beat himself up in anger!***In the villa area of the Imperial Capital.“Chen Chen said that she would be inviting a feng shui master to visit our house today.” Mama Xiao said, instructing the kitchen to cook some food. “After the expert said that something was wrong with the feng shui in our house, those few feng shui masters that we invited were mostly fake, and they just wanted to fool people for money…”Papa Xiao glanced at her. “What, so you believe this one this time?”Hearing his words, Mama Xiao was even more dumbfounded. “If Chen Chen had invited someone who was more than a hundred years old, I might have believed her, but do you know who she’s bringing?”“Who?” Papa Xiao was curious.“Her dorm mate!” Mama Xiao thought a bit, before not being able to hold back her laughter. “I think that child is just going along with the fuss, so don’t you be giving them any looks when they come.”“Her dorm mate? It can’t be just another fake?” Papa Xiao frowned. A girl only about twenty years of age, she couldn’t be any master.Grandpa Xiao had just returned from his stroll outside, and he caught the end of their conversation.“Don’t underestimate young people in their twenties.” Gu Xiqiao would still come and treat Grandpa Xiao in recent years, and that’s the reason why his body was still healthy and strong as ever. “Look at Qiao Qiao, wasn’t she just twenty years old?”Papa Xiao and Mama Xiao looked at each other. Right now, in this house, there was probably only Grandpa Xiao, apart from Xiao Yun, who could call Gu Xiqiao in such a casual and familiar manner. “Grandfather, do you think a person like Miss Gu can be found just anywhere?”They didn’t understand the entire story, but vaguely remembered and heard that Gu Xiqiao was a person who had broken through all three realms.The three continued to chat for a while more, before Xiao Yichen returned home, with another young girl trailing behind her.The girl looked to be the same age as Xiao Yichen, and her complexion was fair and bright. She had a healthy flush on her face, and her features were dazzling and delicate. Her skin was as white as snow, and there was an amazing brightness between her eyebrows. Her beauty was like a blazing, and it would burn anyone who looked at her. Anyone who looked at her would definitely not be forgetting her beauty anytime soon! There was also a mysterious aura that surrounded her, suppressing the scorching heat that exuded from her body.Grandpa Xiao couldn’t help but sigh a little when he saw the girl, a slightly faraway look in his eyes.“Chen Chen, how do we address this person?” Grandpa Xiao looked at Tan Yongsi, his mouth open to say something for a long while, but nothing came out, and turned to Xiao Yichen instead to ask.“Great-grandfather, it’s fine to just call her Sisi.” Xiao Yichen was able to tell that her parents clearly didn’t believe her, so she took the lead in striking up the conversation. “She’s here today to read the feng shui of our house.”Tan Yongsi had already glanced around to study the structure of the house during this exchange, and when Xiao Yichen said that, she nodded her head in agreement. She was well aware that she didn’t look like any trustworthy feng shui master, but these kinds of things depended on the sincerity to show after all.It could be seen that the Xiao family was very rich, and the land that the house was on wasn’t something that you could buy with money in the Imperial Capital.For the villa to be built here, there shouldn’t be any problem with the feng shui itself. The constructors wouldn’t joke around with such a sky-high price villa after all.When Papa Xiao and Mama Xiao heard their daughter’s words, they couldn’t help but give her a doubtful look. They had thought that their daughter had brought her friend back just to go along with their whims, but they didn’t expect her to take the initiative to bring up the matter. No matter how they looked at her, Tan Yongsi didn’t look like any feng shui master, she wasn’t even holding a compass board in her hand.They were afraid that Xiao Yichen’s dorm mate would feel put on the spot, but they didn’t expect the girl herself to speak up at this time.“Uncle, Auntie, you don’t have to mind me. I came here today to look at the feng shui of your house.” Tan Yongsi waved her hand, and her face had a gentle expression on it. At first glance, she had looked to be someone who was arrogant and placed herself above people. “Your family has very good fortune, especially Mr. Xiao’s generation. People with exceptional talents appeared in this generation, and the Xiao family is thriving because of that. However, you have to keep in mind that the merits accumulated in one generation is not enough to last the entire line. If the Xiao family intends to prosper for a long time, then don’t let the merits be wasted or stopped.”Hearing these words, Grandpa Xiao turned to look at Tan Yongsi. Even Xiao Yichen’s parents also turned to look at her.Of course they knew who the person of merit Tan Yongsi was talking about. Since young, they had told Xiao Yichen that she was not allowed to talk about matters of the ancient martial arts world, so these things that came from Tan Yongsi’s mouth was definitely not something Xiao Yichen had told her!Thinking about this, Papa Xiao’s face changed. He straightened up, bowing respectfully to her. “Great Master, please have a look. What is wrong with the feng shui of our house?”“Uncle, you can just call me Sisi.”“Understood, Great Master!”Tan Yongsi: “…” You just acted like I didn’t say anything, did you.Tan Yongsi walked the house from upstairs to downstairs while the whole family watched her closely.“There’s nothing much to the other parts.” She pointed to the fish tank by the door, smiling. “Water is displayed by the door. The mountain represents people, and water represents wealth*. The direction of the door is coincidentally facing the position of ‘wealth’. It seems that your family must have someone who knows feng shui. To place a fish tank here, it’s to attract wealth into the family.” (T/N: This is a saying from feng shui reading)The Xiao family looked at the fish tank, then those about the person who had given them the fish tank, and were now thoroughly impressed with Tan Yongsi.“To place a fish tank here, the person who did so must have a deep understanding of feng shui.” Tan Yongsi walked to the side of the sofa. “How could they make such a mistake?”“What?” Papa Xiao’s heart skipped a beat.Tan Yongsi stood by the sofa, then turned to look at the Xiao family with a grave expression on her face. “Mr. Xiao, I wonder what’s the situation of your family’s population?”The number of people in the Xiao family had always been low, especially in Xiao Sheng’s generation. They only had one daughter, that was Xiao Yichen. It wasn’t that Mama Xiao had never gotten pregnant, but she had gone through several miscarriages. Xiao Yichen had been able to survive only because of Xiao Yun.They had thought that the reason for this was Mama Xiao’s body and health, but they didn’t expect to hear that this sofa was the root of their problems?Seeing the expression of the Xiao family, Tan Yongsi could guess it. “The position of the sofa and the door forms a line, forming an opposing aura. Its disadvantage is that it will cause the loss of family members, and wealth to scatter everywhere.“And also, Yichen’s bedroom.” Tan Yongsi pointed her finger upwards. “There’s a beam directly above the bed. With the beam above it, there’s an oppressing force when you sleep in the bed, which can cause psychological pressure, which will affect someone’s studies and health.”Great Master! She really was a Great Master!“Great Master, you might not know this, but this fish tank was given to us by an expert. They said that we needed to place it by the door, but she has never seen the house.”That was a plausible explanation, Tan Yongsi nodded her head as she thought. She then pulled out a gourd and gave it to Papa Xiao. “Hang this on the head of the bed, and it will solve this matter. As for the sofa… you wouldn’t mind changing the position a little, right?”As soon as she said that, Papa Xiao was already getting people to move it. “Great Master, where do you think is a good place to put it?”“There’s a taboo on placing the sofa without a ‘support’ behind it. Put it there, but you have to place a screen behind it,” Tan Yongsi said as she pointed to a spot.“Great Master, I’d like to ask some questions about my career.” Papa Xiao had thought about this for a while, before finally asking.Tan Yongsi didn’t respond, but gave him a glance. “Write a word for me.”Papa Xiao immediately got a pen and paper, writing the Chinese character ‘人’. The pressure as he wrote was vigorous and powerful, and it can be seen from the word he just wrote that he was skilled at writing.“There’s a sense of loneliness in the word, ” Tan Yongsi said, adding two strokes on the paper. “One stroke for ‘大’, and the one more for ‘天’. It will get smoother in a couple of years.”“Is there any way to resolve this?” Papa Xiao asked, looking at Tan Yongsi with piercing eyes.“There’s water next to the door to urge wealth to come in, and the negative energy with the door has been resolved. I think your problems will resolve by themselves soon,” Tan Yongsi put down the pen as she said.“Great Master, we’ve really offended you just now.”Papa Xiao was red with embarrassment, remembering how he had felt and looked at her like she was a liar when she first stepped in, and he felt ashamed.Tan Yongsi just smiled in response, not feeling offended at all as she sipped on her cup of tea.Papa Xiao suddenly felt the person in front of him had just gotten more mysterious and unpredictable than ever.“SIsi, you’re really something.” Xiao Yichen plopped herself down beside Tan Yongsi. “When will you divine something for me?”“Three hundred per hexagram a day, not any lower.” Tan Yongsi said, stretching out her hand.Xiao Yichen didn’t know if she should be laughing or crying at that. “Didn’t you say you’d do it for free for us?”“That was then, this is now,” Tan Yongsi said, wagging her finger. “That was the discount for meeting you guys for the first time.”“Forget it then, let’s have dinner.” Xiao Yichen flipped her phone open, and her eyes brightened. “That’s right, my cousin is coming over today!”“Your cousin?” Tan Yongsi thought for a while. “It just so happens that I have to go back too.”“What’s happened? Aren’t you staying for dinner?” Xiao Yichen asked, looking at her.“Your family is too lively.” Tan Yongsi said, shrugging helplessly.Thinking about how her family had been enthusiastically calling her ‘Great Master’, Xiao Yichen was silent. She went upstairs, coming down with a cheque in her hands. “Sisi, take this.”Tan Yongsi saw that it was a cheque for 100,000.“It’s fine, friends don’t have to talk about this.” Tan Yongsi pushed the cheque back to Xiao Yichen. “You didn’t really think that I came here to make money from your family, did you?”As she said that, her phone started to ring. She picked it up, and a male voice came from the other end. He sounded respectful and even a little cautious. “Great Master, have you reached yet?”After Tan Yongsi replied with a ‘soon’, she hung up the call, then turned to Xiao Yichen. “The main point I came to was because of this customer.”“Who was that?” Xiao Yichen tilted her head in surprise.“The Peng family.” Tan Yongsi put her phone away.“That Peng family?” Seeing Tan Yongsi nodding her head without hesitation, Xiao Yichen’s jaw dropped open. She never expected that Tan Yongsi would have any relationship with the Peng family.The Peng family, the family that controlled the majority of China’s military strength, wasn’t a family that the Wen family could even begin to compare to. The Peng family, they were the real people with actual authority in their hands!After exchanging a few more words with Xiao Yichen, Tan Yongsi left the villa. Xiao Yichen had wanted to send her off, but was rejected by Tan Yongsi.Just shortly after she left the house, she turned to see a familiar car approaching, rolling to a stop near her.The driver and its passenger got down from the car.Tan Yongsi had seen the driver before, he was the guy that she had done a fortune-telling for yesterday. As for the passenger, she couldn’t really see his face.The young man was wearing sunglasses and dressed in casual clothes. The sunlight reflected on his cold, hard face. Even if you couldn’t see his eyes, you could practically feel the perfection that his face exuded. This young man’s parents must have saved the world or something in their last life, otherwise, how could they give birth to such a flawless person?After he got down from the car, he took off his sunglasses slowly, revealing a pair of onyx, dark eyes. It was clear and bright, and it was clear that the aura he exudes was chillingly cold. However, when the sunlight hit his eyes, it melted into an unmistakable gentleness.The two made eye contact briefly, then they both turned away quickly. There was no skip in either of their hearts, or any recognition.Except for Tang An, as he clearly saw Tan Yongsi’s face clearly, and remember that she was the girl who had done a reading for him yesterday. He immediately exclaimed in surprise, “Hey…”Thinking for what seemed like half a day before he realized that she had never given him a name, he turned to his cousin. “Cousin, was that person just now your friend?”“Young Master Rui,” Xiao Yichen greeted him, a serious expression sliding onto her face when she caught sight of him. Don’t be deceived by the gentle look on his face, Xiao Yichen had personally seen the other’s violent and bloody methods with her own eyes, and she didn’t dare to presume anything in front of him.It was only after Jiang Yirui nodded his head in return to her greeting that she turned to her cousin. “She’s my dorm mate.”“What’s her name? Do you have her number?” Tang An took out his phone, asking her insistently.He was thoroughly ignored by Xiao Yichen.She didn’t expect her cousin to show up with Jiang Yirui in tow. Xiao Yichen sat down silently, browsing her phone, when she suddenly recalled the bird in Tan Yongsi’s hand yesterday night.“Where did you see this?” A low, cold voice suddenly came from behind her.Xiao Yichen turned to see Jiang Yirui staring at the picture on her phone, his eyes fixed and unmoving.“This?” Xiao Yichen waved her phone. “This is a pet that hatched from Sisi’s egg. Isn’t it cute? But I feel like it’s very familiar…”“Where is she now?” Jiang Yirui asked, turning his gaze to Xiao Yichen.There were only a handful of people who could meet his eyes without flinching, and Xiao Yichen was obviously not one of them. She lowered her head unconsciously. “My dorm mate? I don’t know where she is now, but she should come back to the dorms by nightfall.”“I see.” Jiang Yirui stood up, regaining his former grace. “Send me a copy of the photo.”***At the Peng family house.“Miss Tan, thank you very much for the hexagram image a month ago.” A man in military uniform brought his hands together in respect. “If it wasn’t for your guidance, this time we would have…”“It’s fine.” Tan Yongsi looked at the cheque in her hands, a satisfied expression on her face. “But remember that when everything is too much, you will be at a loss instead. Don’t be too greedy.”Having said that, she walked out the door, not bothered to look at how the other would react to her words.The cheque was for 300,000. After deducting the 100,000 that she owed Yan Han, she would still have 200,000 left.Tan Yongsi returned to the dormitory. The red bird was nested on her pillow, and she fed it food that a bird could eat at this stage of growth.“Little one, why so cold?” Tan Yongsi looked at the bird, feeling that this was definitely not any ordinary bird.As she watched the bird eat, she turned on her computer.At this moment, her phone rang again. She picked it up without looking at the caller ID. “Hello?”“Do you have a red bird with you?” The voice on the other side was a bit cold, but there was also a hint of laziness that couldn’t be concealed. If it was anyone else who was listening to this voice, they would definitely melt from how good it sounded in their ears.It was a pity that the person who was listening to this voice was Tan Yongsi. Her entire concern was on her bird, and she was obviously wary after hearing this. “Who are you? What do you want?”“I’m downstairs. If you don’t want the school to go up in flames, you better hurry up and bring the bird down with you.” The other side didn’t give her a chance to respond, hanging up the call as soon as he said that.Tan Yongsi felt that the call was a strange one, but there was something nagging in her heart that told her this person wasn’t kidding when he said he would burn the school.The egg came from an abnormal origin anyway, and it wasn’t normal at all for birthing an egg after more than ten years.Thinking of this, she couldn’t sit still any longer. She stood up immediately, picking up the small creature carefully and ran downstairs.Downstairs, there was a figure that was particularly eye-catching.His head was hung low, his hands shoved in his pockets. You could only see the perfect, sharp jaw, and the back of his figure was enough to attract countless eyes. However, the pressure around him made everyone wary of approaching him.Countless girls were wandering close by, but none of them dared to go any nearer to him.“Face me straight up! Look at me straight!”“I’m still obsessed with Young Master Yan till the day I die, but I never expected to be done in by the back of a figure. Even if he’s an assassin, I would die willingly…”Countless similar words echoed through the dormitory.At this moment, the young man finally raised his head.There was a sudden intake of breath by everyone who was looking at him.This was the second time Tan Yongsi was seeing this person. Why did she remember him so clearly? Probably because with such a pair of eyes, you wouldn’t forget it even if you only saw it once.As she thought about this, she pulled out her phone, intending to call the person to ask what the heck was happening. What was this bird?Just as she was about to make the call, a cold voice came from above her. “Show it to me.”His eyes were fixed on the bird in her palm, focused and gentle.“This matter is a little complicated.” Having confirmed something after looking at the bird, Jiang Yirui rubbed his temples. “Can we find a place where we can eat and talk?”Tan Yongsi hadn’t had dinner yet, so she nodded when she heard his suggestion. She really wanted to know the origin of this bird.When he had mentioned finding a place to eat, Tan Yongsi had thought they’d find a simple place to do so, so she didn’t expect him to bring her to a place where it was a complete membership only club!So high class?Tan Yongsi stood at the entrance, looking at the magnificent gate of the clubhouse. Speaking of which, she had never been to such a high-class place to eat before.Thanks to this person’s blessing, this was the first time she could.Jiang Yirui went to park the car in the parking lot, and she stood at the entrance, waiting for him.“Wait a minute, Young Master Yan, isn’t this your ex-girlfriend?” A group of people entered the door of the club at this moment, and the one in the lead caught sight of Tan Yongsi, stopping in his tracks. “To bump into Miss Tan at this place. Say, it can’t be that she knew that you had a date with Miss Wen here today, and purposely came here to follow you?”Yan Han was also among the group, and naturally also saw Tan Yongsi, and was surprised.But when he heard the words the other had said, a complicated expression arose on his face as he turned to look at Tan Yongsi. “Sisi, I didn’t expect you…” Before he could finish his sentence, they were interrupted by another voice.“Let’s go.” It was only two words, but the voice was mesmerizing and low, and it felt like a bomb had been set off in everyone’s hearts who had heard it.Everyone turned around to follow where the voice had come from, to see a slender, handsome young man walking up to Tan Yongsi and speaking these words to her in a low voice.</p> </div> </div> <div class="row turn-page"> <a class="col-xs-2" href="/Rebirth%20of%20an%20Idle%20Noblewoman/382.html?v=1662298296834">Previous</a> <a class="col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:center;" href="/Rebirth%20of%20an%20Idle%20Noblewoman/book.html?v=1662298296832">Table</a> <a class="col-xs-2 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:right;" href="/Rebirth%20of%20an%20Idle%20Noblewoman/384.html?v=1662298296835"> Next</a> </div> <hr></div><hr><footer class="container"> <p>© Company 2014</p></footer><amp-lightbox id="searchLightbox" class="-il" layout="nodisplay" on="lightboxOpen:searchInput.focus; lightboxClose:searchTriggerOpen.focus" scrollable="" hidden="hidden"> <div> <div class="-ic" role="button" tabindex="0" on="tap:searchLightbox.close"></div> <div class="-ih"> <div class="-sg -sb" on="tap: searchLightbox.close, AMP.setState({ query: '' }), searchForm.clear" role="button" tabindex="0"> <div class="ap-a-ico -sw"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#close"></use> </svg> </div> </div> <div class="ap-o-search-field"> <form action="#" action-xhr="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/echo" class="-ip" id="searchForm" on="submit:AMP.setState({ query: throttledValue }),searchResult.focus" target="_top"> <amp-autocomplete class="-id" filter="substring" min-characters="1" on="select:AMP.setState({ query: event.value })" submit-on-enter="false" src="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/autosuggest"> <div class="ap-a-ico -im"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#search"></use> </svg> </div> <input id="searchInput" class="-iv" name="q" placeholder="What are you looking for?" on="input-throttled:AMP.setState({ throttledValue: event.value })" required=""> <button class="-ig" type="submit" name="search-submit" disabled="" [disabled]="!throttledValue">Search </button> <div role="listbox"></div> </amp-autocomplete> </form> <div class="empty" [class]="query ?
