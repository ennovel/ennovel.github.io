Today was Friday, my last day in Seattle. By this afternoon, I'd be in Kellan's arms in Los Angeles. I couldn't wait. I bounded out of my makeshift bed and nearly tripped over the girlfriends sprawled around the living room floor.</p><p>Jenny groaned when I bumped her elbow, but she didn't wake up. Giddy, I hurried upstairs to take a shower and get ready to go. Anna was picking me up soon, and I wanted to be fresh and sparkling clean for my reunion with Kellan. It had only been a couple of weeks since he'd left me, but it felt like an eternity. That always happened when he went away. Time's continuity seemed to depend on Kellan's proximity to me-the farther away he was, the longer time stretched.</p><p>When I emerged from the shower, I smelled the heavenly aroma of freshly brewed coffee. My mouth watered at the smell, and Kellan was instantly in my mind . . . not that he'd ever really left. He was usually somewhere in the back of my brain, but coffee always brought him right to the forefront.</p><p>After I was dressed and ready to go, I grabbed my bags and hurried downstairs to set them by the front door. Most of the girls were awake by then, rubbing their eyes, sipping on mugs of coffee while they started putting their stuff back together. Jenny gave me a one-armed hug as she held a travel mug of coffee out for me. "Anna just called. She's on her way."</p><p>I nodded as I took a sip-it burned my tongue a little but it was gloriously creamy. Jenny glanced around at the still-full living room. "I'll make sure the girls get home, then lock up the house before I leave."</p><p>Her words reminding me of something, I dug through my bag to find my key ring. After freeing it from the book I was hoping to read on the plane, I flipped through the keys until I found the one for the Chevelle. "Can you do me a favor today?" Jenny nodded as I handed her the key to Kellan's baby. "I made arrangements with the auto body shop below Evan's loft. They're going to garage the Chevelle for me until I come back. Can you drop off Babe-ette?"</p><p>Jenny smirked at my nickname for Kellan's car. "Sure thing. Rachel and I will drop it off this afternoon."</p><p>Rachel came over to stand by Jenny and rested a tired head on her shoulder. We'd stayed up way too late last night. The exotic beauty let out a loud yawn, and Jenny sympathetically patted her dark head. Her almond eyes blinked at me a moment, then she lifted her head. In a quiet voice, Rachel asked, "Would you mind saying hello to Matt for me? And telling him . . . I wish I could be there with him?"</p><p>The demure girl bit her lip, and a light flush tinted her tanned cheeks. I immediately told her I would. I knew exactly how it felt to be kept apart from the person you loved. It sucked. But Matt and Rachel seemed to have the long distance thing down pat, and I felt pretty good about them making it through the crazy lifestyle the boys had-or were about to have.</p><p>I also felt good about Evan and Jenny's relationship. Looking over to my best friend, I told her, "And I'll give Evan a great big bear hug for you."</p><p>Jenny gave me a wide smile, then reached into her back pocket. She pulled out a lime green box of candy that had been flattened and folded into thirds. With a mischievous grin, she handed it to me. "Can you give him this too?"</p><p>Curious, I unfolded what turned out to be a box of Jujubes. As I refolded the box, I asked, "You want me to give him your garbage?"</p><p>Jenny started giggling. "Don't worry, he'll get it."</p><p>I tucked the box in my bag, wondering just what inside joke I was being the messenger of. Well, however I could help was fine by me. Evan and Jenny were my rock star role model couple after all.</p><p>Cheyenne and Kate came over to give me goodbye hugs. As Kate pulled away, she said, "Hey, Justin is in L.A. right now. If you happen to see him, will you tell him I said . . . hey?"</p><p>She laughed, and her springy ponytail bounced around her shoulders. Justin was the lead singer of a band that was already pretty big-Avoiding Redemption. The five-man group had been the ones to "discover" the D-Bags, inviting them along on their sold out tour. Kellan's band got noticed by the industry while on that tour. In fact, Justin's label was the label that had scooped up the D-Bags. Kate had a thing for Justin, and I think Justin had a thing for her as well. Ever since the pair had met, they'd been texting each other on a regular basis. Her golden brown eyes sparkled with excitement when I told her I'd keep a lookout for him.</p><p>Just as the doorbell rang, Cheyenne wrapped me in a hug. "You keep your pretty little butt safe down there, ya hear?"</p><p>I chuckled at her as Jenny opened the door for my sister. My chuckle died as Anna stormed into the room. She dramatically tossed her bag onto the half-moon table in the entryway. "It's times like these that I really wish I could drink," she murmured.</p><p>"Problem?" Jenny asked as she shut the door.</p><p>Anna looked over her shoulder. "Besides the fact that I'm going to kill that fucker when I get to L.A.?"</p><p>No one needed to ask who the fucker in question was. Pursing her lips, Jenny asked, "What . . . did he do?" Her face was blank, like there was no answer on earth that would shock her. I understood that feeling. Really, a better question for Jenny to ask would have been, What didn't Griffin do?</p><p>Knowing what Anna's problem was, I sighed. "It's not that big of a deal, Anna."</p><p>She glared at me. The rest of the girls looked at me with shocked expressions. I didn't usually defend Griffin. "A boy, Kiera. He gave me a boy. All I asked out of this entire . . . fiasco was for him to give me a little girl, but the idiot couldn't even get that right."</p><p>Frowning, I told her, "It's not like he can control-"</p><p>Her icy stare stopped my voice. As the other girls caught on to the source of Anna's vexation, Kate gushed, "Oh my God! You're having a little boy-congratulations! Boys are so a . . . dor . . . able." Kate's voice faltered as Anna's glare shifted to her.</p><p>There was a moment of silence, then Jenny cautiously said, "I'm sure it will turn out fine." Anna started tapping her foot, and Jenny shrugged and gave up. "You're right, Griffin's a tool."</p><p>Anna immediately brightened. "I know! Right?" I had to shake my head at Anna as she went off on her boyfriend for a solid five minutes. Sometimes you just want someone to blindly agree with you, no matter what the problem is. And even if Anna was blowing her predicament way out of proportion, none of us was going to argue with the fact that Griffin was indeed a tool.</p><p>Eventually Anna simmered down enough to say goodbye to everyone and help me get my stuff into Denny's old Honda. Well, okay, she supervised while I packed my bags into the car. I had two of them, which I thought was pretty modest for an open-ended stay. Anna had three stuffed bags and a carry-on that pushed the boundaries of acceptably fitting into the overhead compartment.</p><p>Just as I was settling into my seat and the flight attendant told us to turn off our electrical devices, my cell phone buzzed. Thinking it was Kellan, since I'd just texted him to let him know we were about to leave, I discretely checked the phone. I smiled, seeing a message from Denny on the screen. I'll miss you, mate. Good luck, and be careful.</p><p>I had to shake my head at Denny's never-ending thoughtfulness. I almost showed the message to Anna, to maybe change her mind about Denny, but she would look at the text and immediately assume I'd slept with him the other night. Not wanting to defend my innocence again, I turned my phone off and tucked it into my bag.</p><p>The flight to Los Angeles wasn't long, but I bounced my feet, played with my guitar-shaped necklace, and worried my lip the entire time we were in the air. I even tried writing a little, but I couldn't concentrate enough and eventually put my notebook away. I just wanted to be with Kellan already. My heart was hammering in my chest when the plane touched down, and I think I was breathing harder when we finally taxied into position. Anna snorted and told me, "Calm down, horn dog." But I couldn't calm down. And I wasn't horny or anything, I just . . . needed him.</p><p>It was a free-for-all to exit the plane, so I grabbed my bag and darted for the door before Anna had even stood up. Even though we were seated near the middle of the plane, I was the second person to leave. Nerves skittered around my belly as I sprinted up the ramp. I wasn't sure how I'd spot Kellan in the sea of travelers and visitors in this massive airport. I supposed I could text him if I didn't spot him right away in baggage claim.</p><p>I burst through the corridor toward the waiting area for visitors. I took one brief sweep of the crowd eagerly waiting for friends and loved ones, then I started laughing. Kellan was standing front and center with his arms extended into the air like John Cusack in Say Anything. Only, he wasn't holding a boombox blaring Peter Gabriel. No, Kellan was proudly holding a sign that read-in embarrassingly large black letters-MRS. KELLAN KYLE.</p><p>I should have known that Kellan wouldn't be hard to spot. Even without the sign, he stuck out.</p><p>I let out a strangled laugh-sob as I rushed over to him. I just couldn't believe I was finally with him-and I wasn't leaving this time. Kellan barely had time to drop the sign and catch me as I leapt into his arms. I buried my head in his neck, wrapped my legs around his waist, and held on as tight as I could. His masculine, clean, intoxicating scent hit me as his warm hands caressed my back. My jittery nerves instantly evaporated. I was there. We were together.</p><p>I pulled back when I felt low laughter vibrating my chest. Kellan was beaming as he stared up at me. Maybe it was my imagination, but his midnight blue eyes seemed to be even deeper in color, his lashes longer. Even the curve of his amused smile was more sensual than I recalled. I didn't know it was possible, but he'd become even more attractive in my short absence.</p><p>"Miss me?" he murmured, leaning up in a gesture that clearly said, I want to feel your lips.</p><p>Grinning, I obliged him. Even his mouth was sweeter, more tender. When his tongue flashed against mine and his hand sneaked down to my backside, I suddenly remembered that we were in a very public place, a place swarming with young, innocent eyes.</p><p>Squirming, I broke free from his grasp and set my feet on the ground. He frowned at me; if it was possible, his pout was even more adorable than his smile. "Hey, I was enjoying that."</p><p>"Yeah, I know." I rested my hand against his stomach, and he reached up to grab my fingers; his frown instantly disappeared. He chuckled and bent down to pick up his welcome sign. I had to resist the urge to run my fingers through his impossibly sexy, shaggy, bed-head hair. When he straightened, I pointed to the ostentatious placard in his hand. "I like your sign."</p><p>He grinned. "I thought you might."</p><p>Reading it again as it dangled by his hip, I frowned. "But, just so you know, I'm not going by Mrs. Kellan Kyle. It's too old-fashioned."</p><p>Kellan glanced at the poster board by his thigh, then looked back up at me. "What? It's endearing to take your husband's full name, isn't it?" His thumb reached up to brush my wedding ring as he said husband, and the pride he felt at me being his wife was clear on his features.</p><p>"It's sexist, Kellan. I have my own name. I don't need to assume yours." I smoothed my hand over the soft, black cotton covering his pecs. To make my point, I traced the scripted letters of my name along the hidden tattoo above his heart. Kellan shuddered and his eyes started to blaze. "Just your last name," I whispered.</p><p>Kellan's sultry gaze drifted to my mouth. His lips parted, and as I watched, enraptured, he flicked his tongue over his bottom lip, then slowly dragged his teeth along the plump skin. It was distracting, to say the least.</p><p>Just as I was wondering how much PDA we could get away with before being carted off by the TSA, a loud voice erupted over the cacophony of the airport din. "Thanks, Kiera! I nearly gave birth trying to get my carry-on down!"</p><p>Kellan and I both looked back at my red-faced sister. As she stomped toward us, she huffed at a stray strand of hair that was dangling close to her eye. It was an exaggerated expression that screamed to everyone around her that she was put out. Kellan dropped my hand and took a step toward her. "I guess I should help."</p><p>"Is Griffin here?" I whispered, looking around for the bassist. I was sure he knew Anna was coming with me.</p><p>Kellan paused and ran a hand through his hair. "He . . . decided to wait at the house." He shrugged in apology.</p><p>I was irritated at first, but then I let it go. Griffin had never been an attentive boyfriend. Hell, Griffin had never been an actual boyfriend. He was an f-buddy. He'd said so himself. I thought he'd change once he knew Anna was pregnant, maybe grow up a little bit. But, as Kellan was always telling me, Griffin was . . . well, Griffin.</p><p>It took a while to get all of the luggage, but eventually we wrangled every piece and made our way to Kellan's car. The record label was letting him drive one of theirs while the band stayed at the house. It was a shiny silver Audi convertible. Anna openly fawned once she saw it, but I wasn't too impressed. Kellan looked much better in his solid, sleek Chevelle. Kellan let out a soft sigh as he got behind the wheel, and I could tell he felt the same way about the flashy car.</p><p>Anna was nearly buried in luggage in the backseat, since the trunk in this thing wasn't overly spacious. But she didn't seem to mind as we sped with the top down along the sun-soaked streets of Los Angeles. Her smile was huge as her hair whipped around her. "I could definitely get used to this," she murmured, resting her head back on the seat.</p><p>It had been a drizzly, overcast day in Seattle, which the residents there had actually been happy about-less risk of your house catching on fire by a stray firework if everything was a little sodden. Here, the skies were a clear, bright blue. Well, I suppose the blueness was a bit tainted by the layer of smog hovering over the city, but it was brilliant and beautiful nonetheless.</p><p>The air running through my fingers as I held them in the breeze was also different than back home-warm instead of cool. I took in the expansive, sprawling city in absolute awe. Everywhere you looked, cultures and ethnicities were blended together. The lacing freeways and highways were more complex than any I had ever seen before, but Kellan seemed comfortable traversing them as he led us to the heart of the city. My eyes were everywhere as I tried to take it all in. Kellan laughed at my wonderstruck face. I couldn't help it, though. Los Angeles was iconic, legendary. The size and scope of it was intimidating. There was a reason people were drawn to L.A.-dreams were made there and they were destroyed there. You could almost feel the pulse of life in the tepid air.</p><p>Moving away from downtown, we began approaching residential districts. As we kept going, it was clear from the neighborhoods that we were getting into one of the more affluent parts of town. The properties were spacious, the houses absurdly large, the lawns ridiculously green and plush; they were even nicer than the yards in Seattle.</p><p>As the houses became farther and farther apart, we turned onto a street that was closed off by a gate. There was a paunchy, older man in a booth overseeing the gate, and for a moment I had the strangest feeling that we were crossing the border into a foreign country. If the man asked to see our passports, I wouldn't have been surprised.</p><p>Kellan reached into his back pocket as he stopped the car. "Afternoon, Walter," he said as he handed the man a card.</p><p>"Back already, Mr. Kyle? That was fast. And I see you picked up two beautiful young ladies while you were out." He tipped his hat to me as he handed Kellan back his card and raised the gate.</p><p>Kellan grinned as he revved the engine. "Careful, Walter. I might think you're trying to make a move on my wife."</p><p>Walter seemed abashed. "Wouldn't think of it, sir." He winked at me as he indicated the now-cleared path. Kellan was shaking his head good-naturedly as he pulled forward. Laid-back in his sporty car with dark sunglasses covering his eyes, he already seemed comfortable in his new place. Then again, Kellan had lived in Los Angeles for an entire year after high school, although he probably hadn't lived quite so nicely.</p><p>As we drove past monolithic homes that probably cost more money than most people made in their lifetimes, I hoped Kellan didn't want to settle down here. True, I'd follow him anywhere, but this city just didn't hold the same appeal to me that Seattle did. Everything here was just a little too flashy for me.</p><p>Like the house Kellan finally stopped at, for example. It was a contemporary, three-story home, with sandblasted white walls. There were large decks jutting out from the home, one on the right side, one on the left, so each floor received the most unobstructed sunlight as possible. All of the balcony railings were frosted glass and shiny chrome, and even from the parking area I could tell that the top floor had a pool on its deck.</p><p>It reminded me of a "party house." The kind that you would see in a crude comedy about spoiled teenagers throwing a rager while their well-to-do parents were "abroad." The fact that dozens of beautiful, scantily clad people were milling about the property-with drinks in hand, despite the fact that it wasn't even noon yet-didn't deter that image either. I frowned over at Kellan as a woman in a teeny weeny bikini walked past the front of the car.</p><p>He answered me before I could even ask him who all these people were. "It's the record label's house. Any artist on their label is welcome to come here,and some of them invite guests. Actually, almost all of them invite guests . . . at all hours of the day and night." He rolled his eyes.</p><p>That made me frown even more, because I'd always pictured him tucked away in a quiet, secluded spot, dutifully working on his album. I hadn't pictured him staying at a frat house while I'd been finishing up school. And I'd really thought that Kellan and I would have some much needed privacy here. It looked like I was wrong.</p><p>Giving me an apologetic shrug, Kellan returned his sunglasses to the clip attached to the visor. He hopped out of the car and started grabbing Anna's bags from the backseat. I helped him while my sister looked around with approval in her eyes; she was in seventh heaven. With a wide smile, she locked her eyes onto a blond, blue-eyed man sporting an eight pack. "Oh, yeah, I definitely could get used to this."</p>       <amp-ad

          </amp-ad><p>My eyes zoomed in on the blond man's counterpart. She was wearing a triangle top bikini that barely held in her curves; curves that were too round and perky to be natural. As she walked past the car, the curvy woman gave my husband a onceover and husked out, "Hey, Kellan."</p><p>Kellan nodded at her, then cast me a quick glance. By great effort, I kept my face smooth. It didn't matter if he knew a bunch of beautiful blondes. I was the only woman who would be sharing his bed. I did wish I couldn't see her entire ass as she walked away, though. I mean, really, with how little she was wearing, she shouldn't have even bothered with clothes at all. She obviously wanted to be naked, and I was sure she probably would be at some point today.</p><p>Loaded down with luggage, the three of us made our way inside the spacious home. Everything was first class-the overpriced art on the walls, the leather couches dotting the room, the Persian rugs lining the hardwood floors. Everything screamed money, and as a result, I was a little scared to touch anything. The half-dressed couples lounging around the home like it was their own didn't seem to share my reservations. They draped their bodies across armchairs, used coffee tables without coasters, picked leaves off of impossibly manicured trees. One was even smoking in the corner. Rebel.</p><p>Ignoring them all, Kellan led us upstairs. There was loud music blaring outside. But it was much more subdued the farther into the house we got. Large panes of glass in the curving staircase gave me a view of the central pool in the backyard, where the bulk of the people were loitering. I couldn't be sure, but I thought I saw Griffin in the mix . . . and that he had a bikini-clad ass on his lap. Too distracted by the fineries around her, Anna didn't notice where her boyfriend was. Not that she would care. Well, I didn't think she would care, anyway.</p><p>When we got to the second floor, Kellan led us to a large living room. The way it was set up, it reminded me of a dorm: the main room was the communal gathering area, the door to my left was a free-for-all bathroom, and the five doors along the perimeter of the curved wall were clearly bedrooms. A slider to the second-floor deck was straight in front of us. Evan and Matt stepped through it as Kellan and I dropped our bags to the floor.</p><p>The blond guitarist was laughing and juggling a water balloon in his hand as he said something to Evan that sounded like, "Nice toss." Evan shrugged, raising his tattoo-covered arms in an adorable display of modesty.</p><p>Anna brightened at seeing our boys and looked behind them for Griffin; he usually wasn't too far from his cousin. I didn't have the heart to tell her that I was pretty sure Griffin was waist deep in half-naked babes. Sneaking a quick peek around the space, a thrill of delight went through me that no one but D-Bags appeared to be on this floor. The revelers must have been keeping the party downstairs and outside. That was fine by me. Maybe Kellan and I would be able to have that privacy after all.</p><p>When Matt and Evan noticed us, their playful demeanors turned warm and welcoming. Matt gave me a brief embrace, then Evan scooped me up into a giant bear hug; my feet left the ground. After Anna greeted them, she asked Matt, "Where's Griffin?" A small pout graced her perfect lips as she rubbed her growing belly.</p><p>Matt glanced at Evan, then Kellan. I heard the question in his pale, blue eyes as he sought confirmation from his band mates: Do we tell her? It irritated me that there was a moment of "guy code" camaraderie going on, but I decided not to be mad about it. The band had been together a long time. They'd been through a lot of hard times together, I was sure. They were family, and family stuck by each other . . . even if one sibling was a jackass.</p><p>Finally seeing the answer he needed, Matt focused his attention on Anna. Indicating the deck behind him with his thumb, he told her, "He's by the pool."</p><p>Evan smiled and added, "Look for the annoyed one with sour milk dripping down his face."</p><p>Matt snorted and held up his hand to Evan. "Damn fine shot, man." The two boys high-fived and I glanced at the remaining balloon in Matt's hand. It was bright pink, and now that I was paying more attention, I could see that there was an opaque liquid inside it, not clear. Definitely not water, then. Milk? And not just any milk. Now that I was close enough, I could smell the balloon . . . and it did not smell good.</p><p>A milk stink bomb? Ew. Disgusting. Good thing Matt and Evan's victims were standing beside a pool. Even though it was wrong of me, I sort of hoped they'd nailed tiny-triangle-top girl who'd openly flirted with Kellan.</p><p>Anna's hand clenched over her belly as she realized just where her man was-partying with scantily clad women instead of helping her cart her bags upstairs. She looked infuriated for a moment, then a pleasant smile passed over her features. Hand outstretched, she turned to Matt. "Would you mind if I borrowed that?"</p><p>Laughing, Matt handed the milk balloon to her. "Be my guest."</p><p>Still sweetly smiling, Anna stalked out to the deck. Matt and Evan waited five seconds, then hurried after her. Kellan shook his head and looked down at me. "Want to see our room, or watch Griffin be assaulted?"</p><p>I bit my lip. "Wow, that's actually a really hard choice."</p><p>Kellan chuckled and grabbed my hand. Leading me to the first door along the wall, he murmured, "Well, I've had enough of Griffin lately and not nearly enough of you."</p><p>He opened the door wide and I gasped as I stepped inside. It was more like a studio apartment than a guest bedroom; it was about three times the size of our room back in Seattle. The walls were painted a surprisingly warm shade of gray, with furniture in a deep, contrasting dark cherry. The bedspread was black with intricate silver designs. The sheets and pillows were crisp white, with designs that matched the comforter, but in black. Silver and black lamps adorned the nightstands, and gray lounge chairs created a quiet space in the corner, perfect for reading or writing. A giant flat-screen TV was fixed to the wall opposite the bed.</p><p>All in all, it was a very manly room, but it did have some feminine touches. A crystal chandelier was hanging in the middle of the room. Deep purple throw pillows were artfully arranged on the bed, and a plush purple rug was lying at the foot of it. Tall pillar candles were positioned in clumps of three throughout the room, and a vase overflowing with white lilies highlighted an ornate lowboy dresser.</p><p>The room was stunning, but that wasn't what made me gasp. Kellan had taken bright red rose petals and scattered them over the floor and on top of the bed. The red seemed even deeper in color against the black bedspread. Over the top of the red petals, Kellan had carefully placed a layer of white petals. Those petals formed a heart, and on the inside of the heart was a box. A small, velvet box. My heart was surging as I stared at it.</p><p>Closing the door behind us, Kellan murmured in my ear, "Do you like it?"</p><p>I couldn't answer him. I could only nod as I laser-focused on the gift waiting for me. Kellan pulled me forward, and the smell of fresh flowers tickled my nose in a wonderful way. I slipped off my sandals as we walked so I could feel the silky petals under my toes. When we got to the edge of the bed, Kellan stopped and stared at the box with me. After another moment, he pulled it off of the bed, careful to not disrupt the artful white heart. My eyes followed his fingers. Without a word, Kellan dropped to a knee. Even though he'd done this before, even though we were already married in our hearts, the sight of him on bended knee made my eyes water.</p><p>Smiling up at me, he whispered, "Kiera Michelle Allen, will you be my wife?"</p><p>The tears in my eyes dropped to my cheeks as he opened the box. I was already nodding as I stared at the diamonds sparkling in the sunlight streaming through the window. The center diamond was a large round beauty that gleamed with life as it refracted the light. A "halo" of smaller diamonds circled it, amplifying its glow, while a similar strand of diamonds lined either side of the silver band. It was quite easily the most incredible ring I'd ever seen.</p><p>Kellan was calm and relaxed as he pulled the ring out of the box. My fingers were shaking as he slipped the new ring on my left hand, above the promise ring that I'd been wearing as a wedding ring. The two rings complemented each other perfectly, and I couldn't stop staring at them. Kellan was chuckling as he stood back up.</p><p>When I felt more composed, I looked up at him and said the first thing that popped into my head. "You didn't need to do that. My old ring was fine." I cringed at telling him that right out of the gate, but this ring looked pricey, and he didn't need to spend that kind of money on me. He didn't need to win me over-I was already won.</p><p>Kellan smiled and looped his arms around my waist. "Yes, I did."</p><p>I shook my head. "Don't get me wrong, this is . . . unbelievable . . . but I was content with the old band. You didn't have to do this."</p><p>Kellan's smile didn't change. "Yes, I did."</p><p>"Kellan-"</p><p>He cut me off with his lips on mine. "Yes, I did, Kiera," he murmured against my skin.</p><p>My eyes fluttered closed, and I dropped my pointless objection. It was his money, who was I to tell him how to spend it? As his arms tightened around my waist, my fingers tangled through his hair. Our kiss deepened as the emotion of the moment mixed with the ache of our weeks' long separation. It had been entirely too long since I'd been in his arms, and even though this house was swarming with people, I suddenly didn't want to be wearing anything but the new, shiny ring he'd just given to me.</p><p>Silently begging him, I pulled at his shirt. He understood and stripped it off immediately. I ran my fingers over his chest, delighting in the warm, smooth skin, the etched lines and valleys. Leaning down, I placed a soft kiss over my name drawn above his heart. Kellan sighed and held my head to his chest.</p><p>I peeked up at him, and his eyes were closed. His expression was peaceful, happy. Wanting to see his eyes sizzle, I ducked down and ran my tongue around his nipple. Then I closed my mouth over it and gently dragged my teeth across the sensitive skin. I was sure his chest wasn't as sensitive as mine, but I'd read somewhere that guys enjoyed a little stimulation there. Kellan's eyes flashed open, and his smooth face morphed into a devilish, one-sided grin.</p><p>The pads of his fingers trailed down my back, barely brushing against me on their journey down my spine; waves of heat radiated from each point of contact. When he got to the bottom of my shirt, he slipped his fingers under the hem and deftly pulled it over my body. His eyes locked onto my bra.</p><p>I was traditionally a very practical dresser, especially in the undergarment department. Your basic white or cream, full-coverage bras appealed to me the most. But my sister had started interjecting herself into my wardrobe choices. Telling me that no one married to a rock star could wear a bra whose slogan was Finally a Woman, she'd taken me lingerie shopping. I'd ignored her suggestions at first, since the scraps of material she'd tried to force upon me barely constituted a bra, but then she'd started showing me pretty, elegant pieces that I actually liked. The one I was wearing now was a lacy, light pink, push-up bra. I didn't have a whole lot of assets to begin with, but the bra took what I did have and squeezed them together in such a way that it looked like I had a whole lot more. I'd say I was stretching our honesty pact by wearing it, but Kellan already knew my body well. I was merely dressing up the package, or so my sister said. I couldn't wait for him to see the matching underwear.</p><p>It took him a solid fifteen seconds to return his gaze to my face. When he did, his eyes were burning with the passion I'd wanted to see earlier. He chewed on his lip a moment, then shook his head. "You didn't have to do that," he playfully told me. "I liked the old one just fine." His amused smile grew as he used my words against me.</p><p>Laughing softly, I yanked on the waistband of his shorts, pulling his hips closer to mine. "Yes, I did," I muttered, before attaching my lips to his.</p><p>He laughed in my mouth, but stopped when I unfastened the button of his shorts. He let out a low rumble when I slipped my hand inside. He was fully ready for me, his body hard against his silky boxers. I wanted to feel that soft skin directly, but Kellan pushed me back onto the bed. Lips parted, his hooded eyes scoured my body as I sat on a sea of petals. Bending over, he grabbed the bottom of my shorts and ripped them off of me. When he caught sight of the aforementioned underwear, he groaned. The light pink was slightly sheer, the straps over my hips embarrassingly thin.</p><p>Looking up at me with an expression that mixed both desire and irritation, he grumbled, "Are you trying to make this last about five seconds?" I laughed and his impish grin returned. "You're killing me, Kiera."He kissed my stomach. "You're actually killing me."</p><p>As his lips wandered down my stomach, I began to believe that he was killing me; the ache pulsing through me was bordering on painful. Dislodging the beautiful, artful floral arrangement, I scooted up the bed so Kellan could lie on top of me. Velveteen petals stuck to my skin as I reached out for him. His eyes softened into an expression filled with love and adoration. "You're so beautiful . . . do you know that?"</p><p>I felt my cheeks heat and I averted my eyes. I was . . . cute, sure, but a word like "beautiful" was reserved for my exotic sister. Kellan removed his shoes and shorts and crawled into the bed with me. Lying at my side, he grabbed my chin and turned my head toward him. "Do you know that?" he repeated.</p><p>Since I had no words in me, I shook my head. Kellan sighed and ran his fingers through my hair. "Well, I do," he whispered.</p><p>His lips returned to mine, soft, but fervent. He moved his hips over mine, and I cried out when we pressed together. The thin barrier of my panties between us amplified the sensation. Our kiss grew heated as the fire within us stoked even higher. Breath fast, Kellan ran his lips down to my ear and murmured, "I love you."</p><p>He rocked against me again, and I arched my back and closed my eyes. I wanted to tell him that I loved him too, but I was afraid that any noise I made right now would come out in a passionate scream, and a small part of my brain was still cognizant of the many people wandering around this home. Instead, I whimpered and dug my fingers into his shoulders.</p><p>When Kellan unclasped my bra and ran his glorious tongue around my nipple, mimicking what I'd done to him earlier, all thought of anyone else being around left my consciousness and I did cry out. Breathing so fast I was nearly hyperventilating, I discretely shoved his head down. He didn't need any more direction then that. Wrapping his fingers around the slim straps of my underwear, he yanked them off and continued exploring the southern region of my body. When his tongue swirled around my core, I screamed out.</p><p>He teased my body right to the edge of release, right to the point where I was panting and clutching at pillows, and petals were sticking to every section of my damp skin. He stopped before I crested, and I ached with the loss. Kellan didn't let me ache for long, though. Quickly slipping off his boxers, he moved over the top of me. He slid inside me at the same time he brought his mouth to mine. "Oh, God . . . I've missed you," I murmured as he filled me. Or maybe I shouted it, I wasn't sure.</p><p>Kellan rested his head in the crook of my neck as he let out a groan of relief. "You never have to miss me again," he panted. Then he started to move; there was nothing in this world more wonderful than the feeling of him moving inside of me.</p><p>My legs wrapped around his as I clenched him tight. The feel of his muscles stretching and flexing as he held himself above me was deliciously erotic. His skin was just as moist as mine, and somehow stray petals had found their way to his back. I wasn't too surprised. If I were a petal, I would find my way across Kellan Kyle's skin too. His breath was getting faster as his lips worked their way up my neck. Even though I could feel his body start to shake, he kept up the slow, steady rhythm that was rushing me to a soul-shattering climax. The scent of Kellan mixed with the light scent of sweat and flowers, filling my senses. I didn't think I would ever be able to forget this moment.</p><p>Nearing the end, even though a part of me didn't want to, I arched my back. I felt Kellan's body turn rigid, his shaking increase; he was nearing the end too, but by the look on his face, I could tell he was trying to hold off. I couldn't. Closing my eyes, I tensed as the burst of euphoria washed over me. I cried out in a long series of moans as I rode out the bliss. Somewhere near the tail end, I heard Kellan murmur, "Fuck," and then I felt his release as he groaned in my ear. It only added to the pleasure racing through me.</p><p>Drained and satisfied, we slumped in each other's arms. Once our breaths were somewhat normal, Kellan husked out, "Sorry, I was going to try to give you a twofer, but I couldn't hold out." He lifted his head and raised an eyebrow. "I blame it entirely on the underwear."</p><p>Giggling, I gave him a light peck. "If the first one is done right, I don't need two."</p><p>Kellan chuckled, and we languidly kissed as we cuddled, both of us now covered in stray petals. As Kellan picked off a few near my breast he murmured, "Give me a minute, and I can probably change your mind about that."</p><p>I was laughing at his answer when the door to the bedroom suddenly banged open.</p><p>I screamed and grabbed for anything that could shield my body. Kellan helped, moving over me so that all anyone would really see was him, which he didn't seem worried about. Horrified, I helplessly watched as my worst nightmare played out before my eyes. Griffin sauntered into the room. His expression was giddy as he beamed at Kellan. Maybe I was misinterpreting it, but I didn't think his happiness was from catching us post-coital. In fact, he didn't seem to even notice that I was there.</p><p>Now I was positive I would never forget this moment.</p><p>Glaring at the person intruding on our very private moment, Kellan yelled, "What the fuck, Griffin?"</p><p>Bouncing on his feet, Griffin ignored him. "Kellan, you're not gonna believe who's here!" His shirt and hair were covered in white, curdled goo; he smelled awful, overpowering the perfect rose aroma that had filled my love nest until just a few seconds ago.</p><p>Irritated, Kellan tossed a thick purple pillow at him. "I don't care! Get the fuck out!"</p><p>Griffin took a step back as the pillow dinged him in the face. I felt red-hot, but Griffin still hadn't noticed me yet. "Dude, you're gonna care when you see her. Get the fuck out of bed, lazy-ass!" It was only then that Griffin seemed to notice that Kellan had company. His smile growing, Griffin drawled, "Hey, Kiera . . . it's good to see you."</p><p>He meant that in the most provocative way possible. I was sure that Kellan would've stormed over and decked Griffin if he hadn't been busy using his body to cover the bulk of mine from Griffin's sight. Realizing he was sort of stuck, Kellan yelled, "Matt! Get your cousin out of my fucking bedroom before I toss him off the fucking balcony!"</p><p>It took a moment, but eventually Matt and Evan stormed into the room to remove their bassist who clearly had a death wish. I groaned and covered my face. Damn it! Now this really was my worst nightmare. Matt and Evan were courteous enough to not look at us directly, but still, it was mortifying. As Anna peeked her head into the room, giggling, Matt and Evan dragged a protesting Griffin out. "Dude, they can bone later! He needs to see who's here!" Griffin returned his attention to us. "She's asking for you, dude. You!"</p><p>Matt smacked him on the back of the head. "Remember what we said about giving Kellan some space when Kiera got here . . . because of that thing he was going to give her?" When Griffin seemed oblivious, Matt hit him again. "Fucking moron," he muttered, pulling him out of the room. "Sorry, Kell!" he yelled as he shut our door.</p><p>Mortified, I clutched at Kellan. "Oh my God! That did not just happen, did it?"</p><p>Kellan sighed and rubbed my back. "Unfortunately . . . it did. Sorry, I forgot to lock the door." He chuckled. "I was a little preoccupied."</p><p>I pulled back to glare at him. None of this was very funny. Remembering Griffin's words-because how would I ever forget them-I asked, "Do you know what he was talking about? Who's here to see you?"</p><p>Kellan shook his head. "No idea." He turned his head to the door, where we could hear Griffin and Matt arguing about Griffin's complete and total lack of common decency. "I suppose I should go see, though."</p> </div> </div> <div class="row turn-page"> <a class="col-xs-2" href="/Reckless%20(Thoughtless%20%233)/6.html?v=1662298308826">Previous</a> <a class="col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:center;" href="/Reckless%20(Thoughtless%20%233)/book.html?v=1662298308825">Table</a> <a class="col-xs-2 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:right;" href="/Reckless%20(Thoughtless%20%233)/8.html?v=1662298308828"> Next</a> </div> <hr></div><hr><footer class="container"> <p>© Company 2014</p></footer><amp-lightbox id="searchLightbox" class="-il" layout="nodisplay" on="lightboxOpen:searchInput.focus; lightboxClose:searchTriggerOpen.focus" scrollable="" hidden="hidden"> <div> <div class="-ic" role="button" tabindex="0" on="tap:searchLightbox.close"></div> <div class="-ih"> <div class="-sg -sb" on="tap: searchLightbox.close, AMP.setState({ query: '' }), searchForm.clear" role="button" tabindex="0"> <div class="ap-a-ico -sw"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#close"></use> </svg> </div> </div> <div class="ap-o-search-field"> <form action="#" action-xhr="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/echo" class="-ip" id="searchForm" on="submit:AMP.setState({ query: throttledValue }),searchResult.focus" target="_top"> <amp-autocomplete class="-id" filter="substring" min-characters="1" on="select:AMP.setState({ query: event.value })" submit-on-enter="false" src="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/autosuggest"> <div class="ap-a-ico -im"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#search"></use> </svg> </div> <input id="searchInput" class="-iv" name="q" placeholder="What are you looking for?" on="input-throttled:AMP.setState({ throttledValue: event.value })" required=""> <button class="-ig" type="submit" name="search-submit" disabled="" [disabled]="!throttledValue">Search </button> <div role="listbox"></div> </amp-autocomplete> </form> <div class="empty" [class]="query ?
