I was still sleeping on a chair in the corner of the room when she placed her hand on my shoulder. "Here, honey," she whispered.</p><p>Groggily opening my eyes, I noticed the steaming cup of liquid she was holding and smiled. Coffee. And the good kind too-it was in a paper cup from an espresso stand, not a Styrofoam one from a vending machine. God, I loved my mom. "Thank you."</p><p>Mom leaned against the windowsill, sipping her own cup of coffee, as she watched Kellan sleeping. Then her eyes drifted over to Denny, asleep in a chair on the other side of Kellan's bed. I'd called Evan last night and asked him to return to the hospital to take Denny and Abby to the hotel the band was staying at the night before, but after making sure that Abby was settled, Denny had decided to stay with Kellan. Maybe seeing that a crucial moment was happening, the nurse on duty had let him.</p><p>Mom's long brown hair was pulled back into a springy ponytail, giving me a full view of her expression. I couldn't tell what she was thinking, though. As I took a sip of my creamy caffeinated treat, I considered how odd it must seem to her to have my ex here. An ex I had cheated on with Kellan.</p><p>After another quiet moment of contemplation, Mom turned to me. Pointing at Denny with her pinky finger, she asked, "He really loves you, doesn't he?"</p><p>She seemed concerned, like somehow he was a threat to Kellan. I loved that she felt protective of my husband. My lips creeping into a smile, I shook my head. "No, he loves Kellan. He came here for him." My smile grew as I watched both boys sleeping. "He told Kellan they were still brothers . . . even after everything."</p><p>Mom's eyes widened as she took another sip of coffee. "That is a very forgiving friend that you both have. I hope you and Kellan realize how rare that is."</p><p>I nodded, my eyes stinging. I did. We did. And we'd never do anything to hurt him again.</p><p>The boys slept for another hour; we'd all been up late talking, and they had still been whispering when I drifted off to sleep. I think Kellan would have slept longer, but a nurse arrived to check on him and woke him up. The nurse asked him how he was feeling, how his pain was, if he was hungry, if he'd gotten up, if he'd gone to the bathroom; all the personal stuff that nurses don't seem to mind asking in mixed company. Kellan didn't seem embarrassed as he sleepily answered her, though. He actually seemed content.</p><p>Gavin, his children, and my father arrived at the hospital while Kellan was eating a watery-looking omelet for breakfast; it was the first thing I'd seen him eat since the accident. When Dad and Gavin walked into the room, they were having a lively discussion about the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Cincinnati Reds. I couldn't stop grinning as the two men went back and forth about which baseball team was better. No topic bonded my father faster to someone than sports. And my parents becoming friends with Kellan's parent was a very good thing.</p><p>Abby, Anna, and the D-Bags showed up with Justin mid-morning. That was still on the early side for the band members, and most of them were yawning when they raised their hands in greeting. Gibson wasn't in the room two seconds before Mom stole the bundle of pink out of Griffin's arms. He frowned at Mom, but he let his daughter go. Tossing an arm around me, Anna laughed and said, "No one else is going to get to hold her the entire time Mom's visiting."</p><p>I watched Mom rock Gibson as a thought struck me. "How long are you staying, Mom? I mean, Thanksgiving is coming up. Aren't you expecting company back home?"</p><p>Her eyes never leaving her granddaughter, Mom shook her head. "We canceled. We're staying here for Thanksgiving." She finally peeked up at me. "We'll fly back when Kellan is well enough to leave with you." She turned her smile to him. "Family sticks together."</p><p>I wasn't too surprised by Mom's news, but it was wonderful to hear. Hopeful, I looked over at Gavin. He pointed over at Riley playing a video game and Hailey flipping through a gossip magazine. The photo of Kellan and I kissing in the graveyard was on the cover. "The kids are on break from school, and I already told work there was a family emergency and that I wasn't coming back until Monday." His warm smile outshone his son's. "You're stuck with me until then."</p><p>Kellan grinned and looked down. "That means a lot to me. Thank you."</p><p>From the expression on the D-Bags' faces, I knew they were all sticking close to Kellan during the holiday, so I didn't even ask. I wasn't sure about Justin's schedule, though; I couldn't remember where his band was at. After I asked him, he told me, "We've got one more gig tonight, then we're free 'til next week." Leaning over, he asked Hailey and Riley, "Hey, you guys wanna see Avoiding Redemption tonight? Maybe hang backstage with some rock stars?" Gavin cleared his throat, and Justin snapped his head to him. "With your permission, of course."</p><p>Since Hailey and Riley were begging and bouncing up and down in their seats, Gavin really didn't have a choice but to say yes. Pointing at Hailey, he added, "You keep an eye on your brother. And no drinking."</p><p>Hailey rolled her eyes, then turned to Kellan. "See what I have to put up with."</p><p>Kellan gave her a crooked smile. "Yeah, he's a real brute." I raised my eyebrow at Kellan's comment, but his expression was amused, not pained, so I felt okay to laugh.</p><p>While light chuckles went around the room, my gaze shifted to Denny and Abby. "What about you two? When are you heading back?"</p><p>Denny put his arm around Abby, pulling her in close. "Well, this is Abby's first Thanksgiving in the states, and she wanted the full holiday experience. She even made me promise to watch the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade with her on television." He rolled his eyes while Abby gave him a playful scowl. I chuckled at the annoyance on Denny's face, but I knew better. He was probably looking forward to giving Abby a dream holiday, parade-watching included; there really wasn't much Denny wouldn't do for the person he loved.</p><p>Denny laughed at the look on Abby's face, then told me, "We talked about it on the flight over, and we've decided to stay through the holiday."</p><p>Abby patted his chest. Her engagement ring sparkled in the rays coming through the open window, matching her personality. "Denny's taking me to see the parade in person!" She giggled, and I could tell she was truly overjoyed about watching enormous balloons traversing through the city above elaborately decorated floats.</p><p>From across the room, Griffin discretely coughed, "Wuss." Anna giggled, but respectfully elbowed him. I thought defending Denny was pretty big of her, since he wasn't her favorite person. I guess his showing up here had really impressed her.</p><p>Smiling that everyone was staying for a few days, I stood up. "Well, I have a proposition then."</p><p>Walking around to Kellan's bag of belongings on the nightstand, I rummaged through it until I found the zip-top bag holding his promise ring. Kellan watched me with curious eyes as I removed the small bag from the larger one. Opening it, I fished out his ring and showed it to him.</p><p>Gingerly sitting on the edge of his bed, I reached across him for his left hand; my shoulder ached a little with the movement, but it was already feeling much better. Heart hammering in nerves and excitement, I told him, in a low voice meant only for his ears, "Kellan Kyle, you are the love of my life. You have my heart from now until the end of forever. Will you please make me the happiest woman on earth and marry me . . . Thursday."</p><p>After I slid the ring on his finger, Kellan cinched my hand. Eyes bright, he asked, "You want to get married on Thanksgiving . . . here?" He looked around the clinical room, the mechanical bed he'd only left a couple of times so far. It didn't exactly scream romance.</p><p>Content with my decision, I nodded. "The where doesn't matter . . . just the who. I can't wait another month to officially marry you, and what better way could we celebrate a day of giving thanks than by becoming husband and wife?" I indicated the people in the room staring at us. "The most important people in our lives are already here." I frowned. "Except Jenny and the girls. We'll just have to fly them back out to us. They should really be here for this."</p><p>Evan was leaning against a wall, his face bursting with uncontainable happiness. "Not a problem. I'll have Jujube gather the girls and head on over. She wouldn't want to miss this." He twisted his lips. "And I would never hear the end of it if she did."</p><p>And just like that, the entire moment felt perfect. I looked back at Kellan. "See? This is how we were supposed to get married."</p><p>Kellan's face shifted from surprise to wonder. "You'll really be my wife . . ."</p><p>Laughing as my eyes moistened, I gave him a soft kiss. "And you'll really be my husband."</p><p>From behind me, I heard my mother loudly exhale. "Here, Kiera? Really?"</p><p>I turned to look at her. She had a rigid frown as she looked around the room. "But we already sent out the invitations. We have family coming in from out of state, cousins you haven't seen in a decade or more. And everything is ready at our church. There's going to be a potluck after the ceremony. Polly is bringing her world-famous baked beans, and Gertrude is so excited to play the organ for you. She's ninety-eight, Kiera. She's only got a year or two left in her . . ."</p><p>Baked beans? Schooling my features, I risked a glance at Anna; she was quietly dying with laughter.</p><p>Standing, I walked over to Mom and grabbed her shoulders. "Mom, I almost lost my husband yesterday. I don't want to wait another minute to become his wife. Will you please help me get married on Thursday?"</p><p>A long, fat tear rolled down Mom's cheek. "Of course I will."</p><p>I dried her skin. "Good, then find someone who can marry us on really, really short notice."</p><p>Mom immediately went into active planning mode. "Okay, I'm sure somebody around here is qualified to marry people." She started pacing. "We'll need to spruce the place up a bit, get some flowers." She looked over at Kellan's many get-well bouquets, bouquets that had been steadily growing once fans realized he was here. "Oh, well, those will work." Gently bouncing Gibson, her face fell as she twisted to me. "Oh, your dress . . . I should have brought it with me. It was perfect."</p><p>I tried to look disappointed, but I'd heard all about the puffy-sleeved fiasco from my sister. Giving Mom a consoling smile, I shrugged. "Yeah, that is too bad. But Anna and I will find something, I'm sure."</p><p>Anna sprang to her feet. "And we'll get you your marriage license." She winked at me. I suspected that both people were supposed to apply for them at the same time, but Kellan was sort of bed-prone at the moment. I had no doubt about Anna's ability to persuade people, though, especially men. God, I hoped the person in the county clerk's office was a man.</p><p>Mom did the unthinkable and handed Gibson over to someone else. Griffin took his daughter back as Mom told the room that she needed a phone, a phonebook, a pad of paper, and another espresso-pronto! Gavin left to get my mom some coffee while Dad ransacked the room to get her everything else she needed to make my impromptu wedding a reality. I was elated as I watched her get to work.</p><p>Anna tugged on my arm. There was a glow in her green eyes that matched Mom's. "Let's go find you a dress today!"</p><p>Giggling, I skipped over to Kellan and gave him a light kiss. "We'll be back in a little bit. Will you be all right here?" Kellan looked just as euphoric as I felt as he nodded. In pain or not, I knew he was the happiest that he'd ever been. I knew, because that's exactly how I felt. I was getting married!</p><p>Griffin nodded at Anna when she asked if he could watch Gibson while we were shopping. From the way he was holding his child, it was pretty obvious that he hadn't been going to give her up anyway. Anna had just fed her not too long ago, but we'd have to make this outing on the short side. At least, on the short side for my sister; she could spend an entire day in just the shoe section.</p><p>After Kellan begged me for a final kiss, Griffin murmured, "Your wedding day is Thanksgiving. That's convenient." He pointed at Kellan. "You probably won't forget your anniversary." He looked over at Anna. "We shoulda done that. I already forgot ours."</p><p>Anna smirked at Griffin while Kellan's lip twitched. "Uh, it won't always be on Thanksgiving, Griff."</p><p>He looked horribly confused. "Huh? Yeah, it will."</p><p>Kellan bit his lip. I could tell he was trying really hard not to laugh, since laughing hurt. "Thanksgiving isn't on the same day every year. It moves around."</p><p>Griffin glared at Kellan. "Don't even try fucking with me, Kell." He tapped his finger to his head. "I'm on to you."</p><p>I heard Matt and Evan snigger with Justin and Denny. My dad stared at the ceiling as he shook his head. I couldn't contain my giggle; poor Kellan had to take long, slow exhales so he didn't laugh with everyone else. "Griff, I'm not . . ."</p><p>Still laughing, I patted Kellan's leg. "You should probably just let this one go."</p><p>A laugh escaped Kellan, and he lightly held his stomach. "Damn idiot," he muttered, his face scrunched in discomfort.</p><p>Feeling like Kellan was in good hands, I squeezed his leg and headed out of the room with Anna. Once in the hallway, she whispered, "Thanksgiving really isn't on the same day every year?" I almost stopped myself from laughing at her. Almost.</p><p>I explained to Carly what we were planning as Anna called a cab. The helpful nurse seemed a little surprised, since I'd told her that Kellan and I were already married, but a romantic smile lit her face as she agreed to help us out. When Anna and I exited the hospital, our cab was waiting for us near the front doors. I was surprised by the number of fans loitering around the hospital. The window in Kellan's room hadn't given me a full view of them. Not only were they directly across the street, but they were also along the side streets, huddled at the street corners and in large clumps around the entrances. The various groups started pointing and whispering when they noticed me.</p><p>Probably remembering the footage she had watched of me accidentally being pushed into the street by a mob, Anna was immediately on edge. "Let's hurry and get in the cab, Kiera."</p><p>I couldn't stop staring at the mass of people waiting, though. They looked genuinely distraught; some were even wiping tears away. Tears. For Kellan. It broke my heart. I was sure no one from the hospital had given these people any clue as to how Kellan was doing. They had probably only asked them to leave, or at least repeatedly asked them to stay out of the way. Tory had issued a dramatic statement to the press, but a blurb from a record label wasn't exactly comforting. Maybe I could be comforting.</p><p>Feeling every muscle in my stomach tighten, I locked gazes with my sister. "I'll be right back."</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at me. "What are you doing?"</p><p>Swallowing, I looked back at the crowd. What the hell was I doing? "I just want to let them know he's okay."</p><p>As Anna and I started to cross the street, the crowd along the sidewalk seemed to simultaneously shift in our direction. My whole body started shaking. I fought down my fear and anxiety and approached them with my head high. How did Kellan conquer his nerves when he first started going on stage? Do I picture the crowd naked? Unfortunately, I was the only one I could picture naked, and that wasn't helping my anxiety any. Instead of picturing them, or me, I imagined Kellan beside me, walking toward his eager fans with a charming half-smile on his face. I thought of the symbiotic relationship he had with these people, how important they were to each other, and how I could help bridge the gap between them today. My nerves vanished.</p><p>As soon as I got close enough, the fans started speaking. And all of them were asking me variations of the same question: Is Kellan okay? I held up my hands, and they instantly quieted.</p><p>In a more confident voice than I ever believed I was capable of using when addressing a swarm of people, I told them, "Kellan wanted me to tell all of you that he's fine." Remembering his pained face whenever he stood or laughed, I added, "Sore . . . but fine." As tears pricked my eyes, I brought my hands to my heart. "He is touched beyond words that you're here, sending out your love and well-wishes, and I know he would come down and thank each one of you individually if he could. Your support means a lot to him. To us. And we can't thank you enough."</p><p>The emotion of the last twenty-four hours caught up to me. It sealed my throat shut and forced the water in my eyes to run down my cheeks. As I hastily brushed tears away, I heard the crowd murmuring grateful thank-yous. As I turned to leave, someone in the back shouted, "Are you really his wife?"</p><p>A slow smile spread across my lips. Yes, I will be. Feeling close to this crowd of strangers, who deeply loved the same person I deeply loved, I told them the truth. "We've been married in our hearts for a long time, but . . . we're making it official this week." Not able to stop myself, I giggled as I said, "I'll be Mrs. Kyle by Thursday night."</p><p>Surprising me, the crowd erupted into screams and cheers. It made me laugh even more. And cry. Amazed that they were accepting me, my words escaped my mouth in an emotional jumble. "I have to go find a dress now."</p><p>Names and addresses of nearby stores were shouted at me. I was too overwhelmed to take it all in, but I saw my sister nodding as she absorbed it. She may not know when Thanksgiving falls on the calendar, but she was a savant when it came to memorizing sales.</p><p>I was still giggling about my very surreal life when Anna and I climbed into the cab. Anna pulled out her phone as she gave the driver the name of the store that was on top of her mental rolodex. I relaxed back into the seat, content. I was finally marrying Kellan. I couldn't wait. After a minute or so of silence, my sister nudged my arm. "Have you seen this?" she asked.</p><p>She showed me her phone. She was on a gossip site and, not surprisingly, the story about Kellan's accident was being featured. The still shots were horrifying. There were successive pictures of Kellan pulling me to my feet, shoving me behind him, holding out his hand, and the truck striking him. It made all of the fear from yesterday fresh in my mind. It made the injury upon my scalp burn anew, like it had just happened. If the truck had been going just a little faster, if Kellan had fallen back and smacked his head against the curb, if more internal organs had been damaged, I would have lost him.</p><p>As I swiped tears from my eyes, I noticed what my sister had wanted me to see. Below the photos were comments from fans. Hundreds of comments. And all of them were praising Kellan for his actions and proclaiming him a hero. Reading all of their heartfelt thoughts and prayers for his recovery warmed me. Reading about myself in the comments surprised me: He stepped into traffic for her! He saved her life! That's true love. They belong together. They're perfect together. I never believed he was with Sienna.</p><p>The outpouring of support for our relationship took me back. It was as if our accident had flipped a switch on the masses, and they were all announcing us as the new power couple. In the blink of an eye, I'd gone from the condemned other woman trying to steal Sienna's man to Kellan's soul mate. The change was so fast and drastic that my mind almost couldn't grasp it. And the fact that my head hurt and my stitches itched wasn't helping anything.</p><p>I looked back at Anna, floored. "They love us."</p><p>Anna gave me a humoring smile. "Everyone eventually falls for the two of you together. You're meant to be."</p><p>We had so much to do in so little time that I quickly put the mystery of ever-changing public perception out of my mind. When we were finished with dress shopping, I felt like I had run a marathon I was so tired. But I had everything I needed. Anna and I had even worked out the marriage license. I'd been worried about that one, but Anna had poured on the charm and the clerk had agreed to come to the hospital so Kellan and I could fill out the application together. Honestly, I think the female clerk just wanted to see Kellan in person. Her eyes had shone like the stars when she'd figured out just who was asking for permission to get married.</p><p>This was really going to happen.</p><p>Preparations began in earnest the following day when my numerous bridesmaids arrived. I squealed when Jenny, Rachel, Kate, and Cheyenne walked into Kellan's hospital room. My four friends encased me in a tearful group hug while the boys in the room shook their heads in amusement. Boys just didn't understand the power of girlfriends.</p><p>Overwhelmed and emotional, I sniffled as I told Jenny, "I can't believe you're here. Thank you for flying back out so soon."</p><p>Jenny's hazy eyes drifted to the healing cut along my forehead. "I wouldn't miss your wedding day for the world." Her gaze shifted to Kellan lying in his bed, smiling at us. "And I had to make sure you were okay. You scared the crap out of me, Kellan."</p><p>Kellan's lips curved up in a wry grin. "My apologies."</p><p>Jenny laughed at him, then walked over and gave him a quick hug while I thanked each girl in turn. Kellan and I had paid for their plane tickets and arranged for hotel rooms, but they'd each had to shift their lives around to make this happen for us. I was extremely grateful to them, to all of the people who were there.</p><p>After the greetings were over, Rachel cuddled with Matt, Kate nervously stood by Justin, and Cheyenne tried to get Gibson away from my mother. She failed. Jenny wrapped her arms around Evan and giggled. "While I'm thrilled to be here, I can't believe you're getting married in a hospital room, Kiera."</p>       <amp-ad

          </amp-ad><p>My mom sighed in agreement. I rolled my eyes at Mom as I faced my troops. "We've got a lot to do today." I indicated the stale hospital room around me. "We need to make this room suitable for a wedding tomorrow."</p><p>Standing beside me with Abby, Denny slowly shook his head as he took in the garish medical equipment and utilitarian furniture. "That is not going to be easy," he murmured.</p><p>I nodded in agreement. "No, but thank you for helping me."</p><p>Wide smile in place, he told me, "It's what I do."</p><p>Looking over at Mom, I asked her, "Did you find someone to marry us?"</p><p>Pleased as punch, Mom kissed her granddaughter's head as she beamed. "I did!" She pointed a finger at Kellan. "One of the nurses that helped sew him back together is an ordained minister. She said she'd be thrilled to marry a rock star."</p><p>Kellan laughed, then put a hand on his stomach. He still looked a little pale, and his eyes were still a little sunken, but he was slowly getting better.</p><p>Clapping my hands that everything was falling into place, I indicated all of the girls in the room. "Anna and I picked up my dress yesterday, but we'll need to get you all bridesmaid dresses."</p><p>Abby blinked in surprise. "Even me?"</p><p>I peered around Denny to smile at her. "Definitely you."</p><p>Abby flushed with color and seemed really touched that I would extend such a courtesy to her. She was a part of Denny though, and he was my best friend. They were as much of a unit as Kellan and I, so it was only right that they both be included. Glancing over all of Kellan's groomsmen, I frowned.</p><p>"Hmmm, will you guys be able to get suits today?" They were all dressed in holey jeans and threadbare T-shirts. I wasn't such a bridezilla that I needed them in tuxes, but a tiny step up from their typical wardrobe would be nice.</p><p>Grinning ear to ear, Griffin tucked his hair behind his ears. "Not to worry, I've got the suit I want all picked out."</p><p>My frown even deeper, I pointed at Matt. "Do not let him leave the store if he's wearing any sort of pastel color." I paused, then added, "Or anything assless."</p><p>After Matt wholeheartedly agreed, I shrugged. "That just leaves dinner."</p><p>Gavin raised his hand. "Martin and I did a little reconnaissance yesterday, and we found the perfect place. They serve traditional Thanksgiving dinners and are open on the holiday." A Kellan-esque grin spread across his lips. "They even agreed to deliver to the hospital for us."</p><p>I beamed at the two fathers in my life working together. Smiling at everyone, I shook my head. "Let's get to work, then."</p><p>The girls and I took off to find dresses, while the boys left to find suits. I felt a little bad leaving Kellan alone, but Carly assured me that he would be well taken care of, and he needed the rest anyway. I made sure to kiss him at least a dozen times before I left, though.</p><p>Instead of finding matching dresses for everyone, I let them choose their own styles. I didn't want anyone to be forced into something they found atrocious, like puffy sleeves. My only suggestion was that they all chose the same color-a rich deep red that reminded me of Christmas, and Kellan, and love.</p><p>Hailey chose something fun and flirty, Anna chose something so tight I doubt she could breathe. The rest of the girls' styles matched their personalities, demure and exotic for Rachel, playful for Jenny, sophisticated for Abby, and romantic for Cheyenne and Kate. Anna picked out a stunning red frilly dress for Gibson; she was going to outshine us all. Even my mom went with the red theme and found a nice cocktail dress that I was sure she'd wear over and over during the holiday season.</p><p>After dress shopping, we all brainstormed ways to romanticize the hospital room. Abby and Jenny were particularly good at decorating and came up with a plan that I thought would turn out nice. It was also going to stretch the nurse's patience, but hopefully they'd tolerate the slight disruption to their order. I mean, how often can you say a rock star got married at your workplace?</p><p>I was greeted with loud cheers from the ever-vigilant fans when we returned to the hospital. Their numbers weren't dissipating any, not even with the upcoming holiday. If anything, now that news of my nuptials was out there, the number of people was growing. Even a few photographers were in the mix. I didn't care, though. I held my head high as I waved to the group.</p><p>"We love you, Kiera!" was their response.</p><p>That still made me shake my head in disbelief. They loved me? Even if I disagreed with their statement-they didn't really know me, so how could they love me?-I appreciated the sentiment. It filled my chest with hope, love, and a general feeling that all was right with the world. And I supposed that was exactly how a person should feel when they were about to get married.</p><p>The boys were already back from their shopping trip when we returned to the room. Abby and Jenny laid out their decorating plan. The D-Bags looked confused by the explanations, but Denny nodded and instantly started getting to work. He had an eye for design and a knack for aesthetics. It was one of the many things that made him so good at his job.</p><p>Denny and Abby worked together seamlessly as they rearranged the room. There was an unspoken communication between the two of them that was adorable to watch. Denny would merely look at something with an eyebrow raised, and Abby would nod and say, "Yeah, I think so too." They really were a great match.</p><p>While Mom held Gibson and Anna supervised from the only semi-comfortable chair in the room, a handful of us tried to hide some of the unsightly machinery. Riley and I were standing on step stools, awkwardly attempting to hang a superlong linen sheet from the ceiling; I was trying to keep my shoulder rested by not lifting my right arm too high, which made decorating a bit challenging. Kellan frowned while he watched me. "I feel completely and totally useless."</p><p>Dropping the sheet, I huffed a stray lock of hair out of my eyes and smirked at Kellan. "Well, that's what happens when you go and tear an internal organ. Maybe next time you should be more careful."</p><p>Kellan's lips curled into a sexy half-smile. "The next time we're hit by a floral truck, I'll be sure to do that."</p><p>My mother's face paled. "Not funny, you two."</p><p>The clerk from the city arrived when we were halfway done with decorations. She seemed flustered to be near Kellan, and even though he wasn't feeling all that hot, he did his best to put her at ease. Perhaps excited that there was finally something he could do to help, Kellan even flirted with the woman a little. Her cheeks flamed bright red, and Kellan shot me an amused glance. Just like the clerk, I had been a blushing mess when Kellan had first started flirting with me. There was nothing that I could have done about it, though. Kellan was just too sensuous for his own good.</p><p>By the end of the day everyone was tired, but everything was all set, and I was ready to marry the man of my dreams.</p><p>I couldn't sleep at all that night, especially since Anna had made me go back to the hotel with her and the girls. She said I couldn't spend the night before my wedding with my fiance. When I told her she'd spent the night before her wedding with hers, she scoffed in my face. "Griffin and I are way different than you and Kellan." Pointing a finger at Mom holding Gibson, she'd added, "We did everything back-asswards."</p><p>The next morning, Abby disappeared for a few hours to go watch the parade with Denny while the other girls prepped me for my big event. Even though it was a holiday, we were able to get manicures, pedicures, and relaxing facials. New York City really did never sleep. Abby returned while Mom was getting my dress ready, and Jenny and Kate were curling my hair into long loose ringlets. Saying that the natural look suited me better than a fancy updo, they left my hair flowing down my back and across my shoulders. When they were content with my finished look, Anna went to town on my makeup. I reminded her that I was a pretty simple person, so my makeup shouldn't be too much.</p><p>Without skipping a beat, she told me, "Don't worry, I'll leave the whore makeup for your wedding night." Leaning in she added, "By the way, I asked a nurse for you, and you guys will be able to start knockin' boots again in four to six weeks."</p><p>Even though she'd just done my mascara, I closed my eyes in embarrassment as all the girls in the room tittered, our mother included. TMI, Anna. T. M. I.</p><p>Seeing my mortification, Anna giggled and merrily stated, "You're welcome." A laugh escaped me, and opening my eyes, I gave my sister a warm smile. I suppose that was information I needed to know.</p><p>Mom helped me slip into my dress when the girls were all done beautifying me. Anna and I had found a very simple satin, tank-top dress. It was a brilliant white color that had a bit of a shimmer to it-it was elegant and modest, but stunning too; Anna said it suited me to a tee, but I personally thought it suited Kellan to a tee. They were no frills on it-no lace, no beads, no ribbons, no elaborate sleeves. It was beautiful simply because it was beautiful. Like Kellan, the dress didn't need any enhancements.</p><p>I slipped on a pair of simple white shoes, then turned to look at myself in the mirror. I almost couldn't believe it was me I was looking at. With bouncing curls, moderately smoky eyes, and a gleaming white dress, I looked like something straight out of a fairy tale-the princess about to marry her prince. Except, instead of a crown, this princess had a sparkling guitar necklace draped around her neck. Even I had to admit . . . I was gorgeous.</p><p>Mom had tears rolling down her cheeks as she snapped pictures of me on her phone with one hand while juggling Gibson with her other. If she was crying already, she was going to be a wreck by the actual wedding. She might need a Valium. Good thing we were going to a hospital. Feeling my eyes start to fill, I warned her, "Stop it, you're going to make me cry and ruin my makeup."</p><p>Mom sniffed as she made a valiant attempt to control herself. "Sorry, honey, you're just so beautiful."</p><p>Grabbing her elbow, I inhaled a deep, calming breath. "I'm ready. Take me to my husband so I can finally marry him."</p><p>My dad had arranged for a limo to pick us all up. It was a plain one, clearly on the bottom of the rental scale. There were no real frills on the inside except a shelf in the wall holding bottled water. It was perfect, and I greatly preferred this simplicity to the overdone elegance of Sienna's limo.</p><p>The limo dropped us off right in front of the hospital. The fans outside went ballistic when they saw me. They tossed out such flowery compliments that my cheeks felt heated, but I smiled and gave them a gracious curtsy anyway. I even waved for the paparazzi. Let them splash my face all over the magazines. It would only give me more photos to use for my wedding album.</p><p>Our entourage walking through the halls had to have been a strange sight, but all I saw everywhere I looked were smiles. The nurses, the doctors, the other patients-everyone seemed as excited about this moment as I was. Well, maybe not as much as I was. I was nearly bursting at the seams as I clung to Mom's arm. When we got to Kellan's floor, rose petals were scattered along the ground. My eyes misted up just seeing the bright red velvet. My vision watery, I followed the path marked in flowers.</p><p>When I reached the hallway that led to Kellan's room, the moisture in my eyes grew disastrously thick. Dressed in gray slacks and a dark blue button-up top, my dad was waiting for me at the end of the hall. He looked ten years younger as pride filled his face. New tears spilling from her eyes, Mom handed me off to Dad. Whispering, "I have never been more proud of you," in my ear, he enclosed me in a warm hug. It took everything in me to not start crying.</p><p>Holding on to Dad for dear life, I looked down the hallway toward where the injured love of my life was waiting for me. The corridor was lined with at least a dozen nurses, doctors, technicians, and other staff members, and all of them were holding the softly glowing vigil candlesticks that the fans outside were using. Some patients' doors were open, with curious faces peeking through the cracks, but I didn't care one tiny little bit if strangers were watching this bizarre spectacle. I was getting married today.</p><p>The hallway floor was also littered with red rose petals, and at the end of the hallway, standing right in front of Kellan's door, was Deacon. He had Kellan's acoustic guitar strapped around his neck. The minute he saw me, his face split into a wide smile. "You're beautiful," he mouthed, then he started to strum my favorite D-Bags song. I just about lost it. My mother did.</p><p>Carly handed Anna and Jenny small bouquets that had been gifts from Kellan's fans; she gave Kate, Cheyenne, Rachel, Abby, and Hailey flickering candles. She handed me a bouquet of white and yellow Cala Lillies. I hadn't seen these in Kellan's room. Seeing my confusion, she shrugged. "I ordered them this morning."</p><p>Awed and impressed, I gave her a swift hug as each of my bridesmaids started drifting across the petal-strewn tile; their dresses perfectly matched the roses. Once they disappeared into the room, Deacon's song shifted to the traditional wedding march. I couldn't stop the tears then, and Mom quickly dabbed my eyes before running to the end of the hall so she could film my father walking me to my husband.</p><p>I had no idea how I did it, but I made it to the end of the hallway upright. I was shaking so bad, I was sure Dad could feel it. He patted my arm in reassurance as he helped me along. I gave Deacon a brief smile, then turned toward Kellan's room. Even though I'd helped set it up, the room marveled me. Long, silky tablecloths were hung from the ceiling all the way around the sides of the room, hiding the telltale signs that we were in a hospital. Strands of tube lighting were hung along the tops of each sheet-curtain and in between the seams. It bathed the dimly lit room in warmth.</p><p>The hospital had placed red industrial carpets from the door to the other end of the room where the minister, dressed in a sharp black pantsuit, was waiting by the wide window. Linens wrapped with tube lighting and flowers were hung in a way that framed the window, like an altar; outside the window, I could see the swarms of fans in the background. The floor was covered with the rest of Nick's ostentatious floral arrangement. The remainder of the bouquets lined the windowsill.</p><p>Except for Kellan's bed, all of the furniture had been removed from the room, creating space for the guests to stand. As my eyes drifted around the area packed full of witnesses who loved Kellan and me, each of whom was holding a flickering candlestick, I was overwhelmed with love.</p><p>The remaining members of Holeshot and Avoiding Redemption were here, clustered near the door. Still playing the guitar, Deacon moved into the room behind me. Jenny and Anna were standing to the left of the minister; both of their cheeks were wet. Evan was standing on the right side, and Denny was standing in a spot of great honor beside him. Grinning ear to ear, Denny nodded at me and minutely lifted his candle.</p><p>The rest of our massive wedding party was lining the carpet leading to Kellan's bed, boys on one side, girls on the other. Faces full of pride, Matt and Griffin were standing beside Justin, Gavin, and Riley. Opposite them were the rest of my girls, Rachel, Kate, Cheyenne, Abby, and Hailey. Griffin was rocking Gibson back and forth, the tiny baby fast asleep in her father's arms. And much to my relief, Griffin was dressed similarly to the other boys in a solid black dress shirt with matching black slacks that I'm assuming had a back to them.</p><p>My blurry vision drifted to my husband as my father and I passed by the bridal party and stepped to the foot of the hospital bed. Kellan's eyes were glossy as he stared back at me. "You're breathtaking," he murmured. While I'd been gone, someone had helped Kellan put on real clothes. He was lying on top of the covers and had on a loose, white button-up shirt draped over dark black slacks. And he was barefoot. Even a little banged up, I thought he looked pretty breathtaking too.</p><p>I stood at the end of his bed, fully prepared to climb in with him and get married lying down, but Kellan held his hand up to stop me. "Wait."</p><p>Preparing himself for pain, he started to sit up. I immediately took a step away from my father. "No, Kellan, don't. You're still weak, you can lie down. You don't have to stand for this."</p><p>Cringing in discomfort, he grabbed onto his IV stand with white knuckles. "I've been waiting my entire life to marry you, Kiera. I think I'll stand."</p><p>Gavin instantly handed his candle to Riley and rushed to Kellan's side. It almost made me laugh that both of our fathers were helping us to the altar, but I was too touched by Kellan's actions to do anything but cry-a happy, pride-filled cry.</p><p>After Kellan jerkily made his way to the nurse marrying us, his father stepped back. My dad kissed my cheek before letting me go. Fearful of Kellan toppling over, I rushed in to take the void left by Gavin. Kellan smiled down at me, then let out a low, controlled exhale. "I'm okay."</p><p>Wanting to match Kellan, I kicked off my shoes and tossed them out of the way; rose petals stuck to the soles of my feet. Aside from the IV stand Kellan was holding on to for support, we looked like we were getting married on a beach, and I could easily imagine the sound of the ocean in the background-although that could have been the rustling of all the people trying to pack themselves around the door so they could watch.</p><p>Kellan laughed as I curled my toes on the carpet, and he didn't cringe as much as he had yesterday. While the minister thanked everyone for being there, Kellan reached into his pocket and placed something in my palm. Discretely looking, I saw a rose petal with the words Forever Your Husband written in bold black letters.</p><p>I clenched it in my hand as the tears mercilessly rolled down my cheeks. I wanted to lean up and kiss him, but we weren't at that part yet, so I restrained myself. Not kissing Kellan Kyle is very hard to do, especially when he was looking at me like I was the most miraculous thing he'd ever seen.</p><p>I clasped Kellan's free hand with both of mine as the minister directed her speech toward us. "Kellan Kyle, Kiera Allen, your friends and family are gathered here today to watch your two separate lives merge into one. From this point forward, you will face the trials, tribulations, and triumphs of life as one being. You will be bound together, body and soul, and the desires of the one will be forsaken for the needs of the two. But there is strength to be gained from this bond, for each of you. Where one might break, two can stand tall. Where one might fold, two can hold firm. From here until the end of your days on earth, you will have someone to support you during times of weakness, comfort you during times of grief, encourage you during times of fear, and celebrate with you during times of joy. That is a gift, one that should never be abused or taken for granted. Cherish each other as God cherishes you, and you will both know peace."</p><p>I squeezed Kellan's hand as I glanced up at him. We'd been through so much already, but she was right-we were strongest when we were together. We lifted each other up, brought out the best in each other. We were better people together. From somewhere behind me, I could hear my mother sobbing.</p><p>Looking to the Best Man and Maid of Honor, the minister asked, "Do you have the rings?"</p><p>Anna nodded as she wiped her tears away with a knuckle. Kellan and I had handed over our rings while decorating. I was a bit relieved that Anna hadn't lost Kellan's. Motherhood had done wonders for her responsibility. Her eyes swimming with more tears waiting to fall, Anna handed me Kellan's promise ring. Evan's face was equally emotional as he handed Kellan my wedding ring.</p><p>As Kellan and I faced each other, the nurse leaned in and asked, "Do you want me to say the standard vows, or would you like to say your own?"</p><p>Looking deep into my eyes, Kellan immediately responded with, "I'd like to say something."</p><p>Lost in his dark blue depths, I deflated the encroaching ball of nerves in my stomach, nodded, and said, "I'd like to say something too."</p><p>Looking pleased, she indicated for Kellan to start. Letting go of his stabilizing IV stand, Kellan wobbled on his feet for a second. Evan looked ready to hold him upright, but, face pale, Kellan managed on his own. Grabbing my left hand, Kellan tenderly opened my fingers; the warmth of his touch shot up my arm.</p><p>Placing the circle of metal at the end of my ring finger, his soft voice filled the space between us. "Kiera Michelle Allen, my life was empty before you stepped into it. I thought I had everything I needed, but only because I didn't let myself want anything. And then I saw you, and you burned a hole straight through me. I have never wanted anything more in my life. And I have never been more terrified in all my life. In all my life," he repeated.</p><p>I swallowed; I understood how dire that sentence was. I felt like he was cutting me open and caressing me at the exact same time. I wanted to say something, but a look of absolute wonder filled Kellan's expression. "And then, beyond some miracle that I'll never understand, I got to keep you, and now . . . I'm only just beginning to understand what it means to truly want something. Because I want so much now. I want to make you happy. I want to give you the world. I want you to be proud of me. I want to comfort you. I want you to comfort me. I want to hold you when you're scared. I want you to hold me when I'm scared. I want to make you laugh. I want to make you blush." Leaning in, he whispered, "I want to make you scream."</p><p>I subsequently blushed, and Kellan chuckled. Sliding the ring over my knuckle, he told me, "I want to give you a home. I want to fill it with children. I want to take care of you. I want to grow old with you. I want you by my side, every day." Folding his hand over mine once my ring was in place, he shrugged and shook his head. "I just want you. Do you want me too?"</p><p>I could barely speak I was so choked up. Man, he had a way with words. Somehow, I managed to squeak out an, "I do."</p><p>The smile that blossomed over Kellan's face brightened his pallid cheeks. Wondering how on earth I could possibly follow up that speech, I inhaled a calming breath and swallowed a half-dozen times.</p><p>Gently grabbing Kellan's hand, I slid his ring onto his finger. "I never thought of myself as anything but plain and ordinary until you came along. The way you look at me, the way you see me . . . you pull something out of me. When I want to hide, you urge me forward. When I think I'm not good enough, you make me believe I am. When I feel anything but pretty, you convince me I'm beautiful. Just being around you makes me feel special. You don't think you're good at loving people, but you are. Your friends, your family . . . the level of love that you have for people astounds me. You don't think people love you back, but they do. They fiercely love you. I fiercely love you. I've never met anyone as passionate as you, as kindhearted as you . . . as amazing as you. You love with every fiber of your soul. You inspire me every day. And if you'll agree to be my husband, I'll do my best to make you proud of me, to inspire you."</p><p>A tear rolled down Kellan's cheek as he watched me. Realizing I hadn't technically asked him a question, I sputtered, "So . . . will you . . . do you? Take me?" Eyes widening, I quickly added, "As your wife."</p><p>Light laughter broke around the room, and Kellan laughed with them. It embarrassed me some, but these people loved me, so I let it go and laughed along with them. Stopping his chuckles, Kellan cringed and grabbed the IV stand. "I do," he told me, his face pained. Exhaling in a steady stream, he added, "So damn adorable. I never stood a chance."</p><p>As I grinned at him, the minister warmly told us, "By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife." Leaning forward, she told Kellan, "You may kiss your bride now."</p><p>As another tear rolled down his cheek, he muttered, "Thank God, 'cause I couldn't hold out another damn second."</p><p>Letting go of his supportive stand, Kellan reached up for my face at the same time that I reached over for him. Careful to not knock him over, I laced my arms around his neck and poured my heart and soul into our kiss. Warm and soft, sweet and luscious, the kiss was full of hope, love, passion, and faithfulness. It was a binding promise of everything we both wished for the other.</p><p>Lost in the moment, I could have moved my lips against Kellan's all night long. Over the din of clapping, I heard the minister announce, "Ladies and gentleman, Mr. and Mrs. Kellan Kyle." The corresponding whistles and shrieks were as deafening as a D-Bags' concert.</p><p>We did it. We were officially husband and wife. And I could honestly say I had never been happier.</p> </div> </div> <div class="row turn-page"> <a class="col-xs-2" href="/Reckless%20(Thoughtless%20%233)/27.html?v=1662298310760">Previous</a> <a class="col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:center;" href="/Reckless%20(Thoughtless%20%233)/book.html?v=1662298310758">Table</a> <a class="col-xs-2 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:right;" href="/Reckless%20(Thoughtless%20%233)/29.html?v=1662298310762"> Next</a> </div> <hr></div><hr><footer class="container"> <p>© Company 2014</p></footer><amp-lightbox id="searchLightbox" class="-il" layout="nodisplay" on="lightboxOpen:searchInput.focus; lightboxClose:searchTriggerOpen.focus" scrollable="" hidden="hidden"> <div> <div class="-ic" role="button" tabindex="0" on="tap:searchLightbox.close"></div> <div class="-ih"> <div class="-sg -sb" on="tap: searchLightbox.close, AMP.setState({ query: '' }), searchForm.clear" role="button" tabindex="0"> <div class="ap-a-ico -sw"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#close"></use> </svg> </div> </div> <div class="ap-o-search-field"> <form action="#" action-xhr="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/echo" class="-ip" id="searchForm" on="submit:AMP.setState({ query: throttledValue }),searchResult.focus" target="_top"> <amp-autocomplete class="-id" filter="substring" min-characters="1" on="select:AMP.setState({ query: event.value })" submit-on-enter="false" src="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/autosuggest"> <div class="ap-a-ico -im"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#search"></use> </svg> </div> <input id="searchInput" class="-iv" name="q" placeholder="What are you looking for?" on="input-throttled:AMP.setState({ throttledValue: event.value })" required=""> <button class="-ig" type="submit" name="search-submit" disabled="" [disabled]="!throttledValue">Search </button> <div role="listbox"></div> </amp-autocomplete> </form> <div class="empty" [class]="query ?
