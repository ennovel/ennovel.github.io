The first single was going to be the song they recorded with Sienna. There was already a huge buzz about it, especially once word got out that the mysterious man in the photograph was the lead singer of the band featured on Sienna's new song. I wasn't sure how it happened, but the tabloids figured out who Kellan was and ran with the story of two young musicians falling in love while recording their duet. Rumors of their relationship popped up everywhere. Now that it had been brought to my attention, I couldn't seem to escape it-TV, grocery store magazine racks, the radio. I'd seen or heard about the damn photo fifty million times already. Okay, it was an attractive photo. They'd captured the moment right when Kellan had been politely smiling down at Sienna, and she was smiling back up at him. I couldn't successfully pull off a profile shot, but Kellan and Sienna looked just as good from the side as they did straight on; it really wasn't fair.</p><p>For some reason, everyone was excited about this imaginary blossoming romance. And everyone was eager to hear what sound these two impossibly attractive people would produce, which instantly made me think that the label was the one that leaked Kellan's name. Hell, it wouldn't surprise me if they'd been the ones to tell the photographers where we'd been going to dinner that night. Anything to drive up interest.</p><p>Kellan had tried his best to squelch the rumors. After the photo shoot, he'd called Sienna on the drive home. It floored me that Kellan had Sienna Sexton's number in his cell phone. Weird. Even weirder, Sienna had Kellan's name in her phone; she instantly knew who he was when he called her.</p><p>"Hi, Sienna, this is Kell-" He paused. "Yeah, it's me. Hi." While he laughed, I tried in vain to hear her side of the conversation. All I got was Kellan's, though. "Have you seen that photo of us? Yeah, that one. Have you said anything yet? Made a statement or something?" He frowned as he listened. "People are linking us . . . romantically." His brows drew together. "Well, I think it's a big deal." He splayed his hand like she was in front of him. "Because I'm married, and I don't want this perception out there that you and I are-"</p><p>Kellan glanced over at me and shook his head. "No, not officially, but we still consider ourselves husband and-" His frown returning, he swung his eyes back to the road. "Look, can you just say that we're only working together, and our relationship is purely professional?" He smiled. "Okay, thank you."</p><p>Once he hung up, he told me, "She said she'd take care of it."</p><p>"And you think that she will?"</p><p>He looked over at me, his sunglasses hiding his expression. "Of course. Why wouldn't she?"</p><p>I didn't want to tell him, but we'd agreed to honesty, so, sighing, I did. "Because I think she's interested in you. Because I think she wants the two of you to be linked. Because I think it creates a stronger buzz for the single if the two of you are together. And because I think she is very good at manipulating public perception to get what she wants."</p><p>Kellan was silent after I said that, which made me think he, at least in part, agreed. After a long moment he said, "And you think what she wants . . . is me?"</p><p>Leaning my head back on the seat, I closed my eyes. Who wouldn't want you?</p><p>Surprising me, Sienna did release a statement shortly after Kellan's phone call, explaining that she was currently single and loving it, and that the man in question was "Merely a close friend who is working on a project with me that the fans are going to love!"</p><p>While she'd done what Kellan asked, I wasn't sure if that explanation helped anything or not. No one seemed to believe that "close friend" really meant "close friend." They all assumed it was code for "we don't want to announce our relationship yet." It certainly fueled the hype for the single. I'd known Kellan's first album would be exciting, but I had no idea there'd be so much energy around the release, energy fueled by rumors and speculation about Kellan and Sienna's personal life.</p><p>Jenny, Kate, and Cheyenne listened to my concerns with sympathetic ears. My sister told me not to worry about it. When I'd asked her if she'd seen the photo yet, she told me, "That? Oh, yeah, I saw it a week or so after I got back. Kellan looks superhot in that pic, by the way!" She sighed. "Too bad he's not turned more toward the camera. They really should have waited to get an exit shot."</p><p>Remembering that Thing 1 had cleared the sidewalk before we left the restaurant, I snapped, "Why didn't you tell me the minute you saw it?"</p><p>Anna let out a long, low exhale. "Because I knew you'd freak out, and I knew the picture was nothing."</p><p>"They're linking them as a couple, Anna." Lying on my bed, I stared at the chandelier above my head. "That's not nothing."</p><p>"Yes, it is. What do you care what the public thinks? You and I both know that he's not with her. Hell, I was there the entire time that she was there, and I know for a fact that nothing happened between them. This isn't a big deal, Kiera."</p><p>"It's weird." Seeing a rose petal on Kellan's pillow, I held it up and rubbed the silky petal between my fingers. This one was a coral color, from a fresh bouquet the maid had placed in the hallway yesterday. Kellan had gone for a run earlier, and left the petal in bed for me. He'd written the words Back soon on it.</p><p>Anna sighed again, but more compassionately. "It's only weird if you let it be weird. Don't get yourself tied up in knots over one harmless photograph. I mean, what's the worst that can happen?"</p><p>My sister was right, of course. But still, having the world at large hope for your husband to hook up with someone else was a little . . . heartbreaking.</p><p>A few weeks before the album dropped, the boys were slated to set off on a whirlwind promotional tour. They were hitting all of the biggest cities in almost every state in the continental U.S. Looking at their schedule was mind-boggling. It was a nonstop jumble of plane rides, radio interviews, and private performances. There were times when they were booked for appearances in three different cities in one day. I was exhausted just staring at the itinerary. If we could get through this, touring should be easy.</p><p>Their first stop on the promo tour was a popular radio station in Los Angeles. No, it wasn't just popular-it was the number one station in the city, and they were going to debut the single there while the boys were in the studio. My stomach was a swarm of butterflies. Even though I knew this song release was only going to fuel the flames of Kellan and Sienna's formulated relationship, I couldn't wait to hear Kellan's voice being broadcasted over the airwaves. It was such a surreal thought.</p><p>Knowing life was going to get very hectic very soon, Kellan and I savored every moment of quiet togetherness that we could. Kellan gave me a tour of the city, showing me some of the dive bars he and the D-Bags had played at during their time here. I could easily picture a fresh-out-of-high-school Kellan wowing the panties off of wannabe Hollywood starlets. It must have been very easy for him to line up "dates" down here.</p><p>Kellan showed me the touristy things too-Disneyland, Seaworld, the Walk of Fame-but my favorite moments were lounging by the pool at the record label's house. Especially when everyone else was gone and it was just the two of us. On a sunny mid-August morning, a few days before the chaotic part of Kellan's career kicked in, we were enjoying a private dip in the pool. I was leaning against the cool white steps that led down into the turquoise water, watching the tiny disruptive waves my legs made as I lightly kicked them in front of me. The smell of chlorine and sunblock filled my senses, and except for some birds squawking in a nearby tree, all was quiet. Knowing this peace wouldn't last, I savored it.</p><p>Under the water, a dark shape approached me. Hands ran up my legs, stilling them, as the submerged body swam right over mine. Stopping at my waist, Kellan lifted his head out of the water and crooked a grin at me. "Hey."</p><p>"Hey," I muttered, biting my lip. His hair was slicked back from his face, and beads of water rolled down his cheeks. The sunlight sparkled in his eyes, lightening the deep blue color. He was glorious, and for this one moment in time, he was all mine.</p><p>Sighing, I sat up and wrapped my arms around his neck; my legs automatically tightened around his waist. He sank to his knees, holding me in his arms in the shallow water. If contentment could be felt as a physical thing, like the warmth from the sun or a cool breeze on a hot day, then surely I was feeling it wrap around me right now as I laid my head on his shoulder and let myself be consumed by his presence.</p><p>Just as Kellan pulled back to look at me, the tranquility on his face matching mine, Griffin stepped out of the house. He walked over to the steps, frowned, and scratched his head, like he was trying to puzzle out how to do something. Then he shrugged and knocked on the railing that divided the steps.</p><p>Struggling to keep his face straight, Kellan peeked up at him. "Yes?"</p><p>"That dude from the record is here. Wants to talk to you."</p><p>Setting me down beside him, Kellan stood from the water. Rivulets ran down the lines and curves of his body. Beads of moisture were left in their wake; they clung to his skin like they were reluctant to leave him. I completely understood the feeling.</p><p>"Which dude?" Kellan asked.</p><p>Griffin shrugged, indiscretely checking me out. "I don't know. The uppity one in a suit."</p><p>Kellan stepped slightly in front of me. "Nick? The vice president of the label?"</p><p>Griffin raised his gaze to Kellan. "I don't know. Sure."</p><p>Kellan glanced back at me. The last time the VP of the label showed up, it had been to offer Kellan a major opportunity. I had a feeling that whatever he wanted now would be just as big. For some reason, though, my stomach dropped.</p><p>Quickly toweling off, Kellan threw on a shirt and I threw on some shorts. I'd prefer to meet with a bigwig fully clothed and fully dry, but my tankini top and wet hair would have to do for now. Best not to keep the man who controlled my husband's destiny waiting.</p><p>Griffin led us upstairs, to where we'd met with Nick and Sienna last time. As I was about to follow Kellan into the room, Griffin grabbed my elbow. I instantly tensed as I looked up at his face. A frown on his lips, he said, "Anna tells me you don't like me. That true? I thought we were cool."</p><p>Wondering why on earth Griffin wanted to talk about this now, I gently pulled my arm from his grasp. "We're . . . cool. Sure." Stay out of my bedroom, don't touch me again, and quit fooling around on my sister, and we're great.</p><p>His pale eyes hardened as he tucked some hair behind his ears. "You just totally lied." He folded his arms over his chest. "I'm not sleeping with you, so I don't really give a shit what you think about me, but I would like to know why you hate me, since I've been nothing but nice to you."</p><p>Nice? Is that what he's been to me? Stifling an eye roll, I glanced over Griffin's shoulder; I could see Kellan shaking hands with the "uppity one in a suit," Nick. I really wanted to hear what was going on in there, not engage Griffin in a pointless conversation. As I avoided answering Griffin's question, he added, "Is it because I said I wanted to get laid? Because I was totally kidding."</p><p>My eyes involuntarily narrowed into slits as I looked back up at him. "No, you weren't kidding. You're crude, obnoxious, and you're a bigger man whore than Kellan ever was!"</p><p>Griffin gave me a "yeah, right" face, which I forcefully made myself ignore. "You represent everything I hate about rock stars. The partying, the women, the sex. You're everything that I'm afraid Kellan will become!"</p><p>Griffin poked me in the shoulder. "So your problem isn't really with me. You're afraid of what Kell might do when you're not around, so your problem is you." He spread his hands out. "Anna's never asked me to not dick around. We've never been exclusive. She doesn't care who I have sex with . . . so why should you?" Raising his chin, he added, "And I'll have you know, I've only fucked about five people this year, and nobody since Anna told me she was knocked up. So, yeah, I do fucking care about her. I think I may even fucking love her."</p><p>He spun around and stormed into the room after that, and I could only stare at him in shock. Did I just get schooled by Griffin? That had to be one of the signs of the apocalypse. But . . . he did have a point. I mainly disliked him because I didn't want Kellan to be like him. And Kellan wasn't like him. They were night-and-day different. Griffin was just so crass. But so was my sister, and I loved her to pieces. Well, crap. Now I had to make an actual attempt to like Griffin. And, wow, he just said he loved Anna. That blew my mind.</p><p>I finally walked into the room, thinking that nothing Nick told me could shock me more than what Griffin had just said. Kellan was sitting on one of the couches across from Nick. Evan and Matt were sitting next to him, but there was just enough room for me. Feeling like I was completely disrupting the conversation, I walked in front of Matt and Evan to sit by Kellan. Griffin threw his weight down in a chair opposite us.</p><p>Nick paused in his pleasantries to wait for me to settle myself into Kellan's side. My cheeks heated as the blond, blue-eyed man tapped his thumb on his crossed leg. Even though it had to be ninety degrees outside, Nick was in a full suit. And an expensive one at that-Armani probably. His tie was bright red, a power color. He seemed pretty young to be a VP, mid-thirties at best, so I figured he was confident and driven, a man who was used to getting his way.</p><p>When I was situated, Nick gave me a brief smile. His calculating eyes took in my appearance, and he said, "Making good use of the home's amenities, I see." His eyes shifted to Kellan. "That's good. You'll need your rest now to get you through the launch."</p><p>Kellan eyed me and nodded. Before anyone in the room could ask what Nick wanted, he told us,"I have good news. Great news." Leaning forward, he clasped his fingers together. I noted the lack of a wedding ring. "Diedrick Kraus just agreed to shoot the video for 'Regretfully.'" When no one said anything, Nick smiled. "You have no idea who that is, do you?"</p><p>"Sorry, no," Kellan told him.</p><p>He waved off Kellan's apology. "Diedrick Kraus is the genius behind some of the greatest music videos of our times. He's exclusive. Hard to come by. We gave him a sample of your song, and he wants to direct it." Nick clapped his hands together. "No, he fucking insisted on it."</p><p>I blinked at the use of profanity by such a high profile person, but Nick quickly moved on. Pointing at Kellan, he said, "Diedrick's got a couple days available at the end of the month, Sienna's got a tiny break in her schedule, and we'll squeeze it in for you during the promotional tour." He lifted his hands to the sky. "I swear the stars aligned for this."</p><p>Kellan's mouth opened as he glanced at his band mates. "We're making a music video?" He looked back at Nick. "Do people even still watch those?"</p><p>A small frown turned down the executive's lips before he righted them again. "Yes, they do." His smile widening, he leaned forward so much I thought he might topple off of the couch. "And we've got an opportunity here to stir the hornet's nest."</p><p>Confusion marred Kellan's features. "I have no idea what that means."</p><p>Nick shook his head. "It means we're going to cause some serious buzz with this video. Ever since the public caught wind of you and Sienna in that photograph, there has been a firestorm of interest. Everyone is curious about Sienna's new man."</p><p>"I'm not her man," Kellan interjected.</p><p>Nick ignored him. "We're going to fuel the flames of Kellan and Sienna madness, and ride the hype to the top of the charts."</p><p>My heart sank as I looked at the eager expression on Nick's face. I wasn't sure what he meant by that, but I was sure I wasn't going to like it. His demeanor radiating caution, Kellan asked, "What do you mean?"</p><p>Excitement on his face, Nick spread his fingers. "We're going to play up the romantic portion of the song, make the video seriously hot. Naked bodies, deep kisses, moaning and groaning, whatever we can get away with." Winking at Kellan, he added, "Anyone who watches it will immediately need to take a very cold shower. The buzz around you and Sienna is going to skyrocket."</p><p>I wanted to stand up and tell this scheming moneybags that Kellan would be doing no such thing, but knowing it wasn't my place right now to say anything, I grit my jaw tight. Kellan's face went the opposite way; his mouth dropped open. "The song is about a breakup," he sputtered, mystified.</p><p>Nick nodded, steepling his fingers under his chin. "Yes, and what great breakup didn't start off with a fiery romance?"</p><p>The room was silent for a moment. Evan and Matt were staring at me, making my cheeks heat. Griffin was ear-to-ear smiles. I wasn't sure if he was happy about filming the music video in general, or about watching Kellan film a scene with Sienna that would make him need "to take a very cold shower." Probably a little of both.</p><p>Finally, Kellan told Nick, "I'm married. I can't do that."</p><p>Griffin volunteered immediately. "I can!"</p><p>Ignoring Griffin's outburst, Nick gave Kellan a hard stare. The look on his face made goose bumps break out on my arms. Definitely a man who was used to getting his way. "I'm not asking you to have an affair with the woman. That part is entirely up to you." He smirked and flicked a quick glance at me. As I glowered, his eyes returned to Kellan's. "I'm merely asking you to film a fictional video with her to a song that you've already recorded, a song that we own, by the way." He pointed at Kellan with laced fingers, and a chilly smile touched his lips.</p>       <amp-ad

          </amp-ad><p>Leaning back, he placed his hands on his thighs like he was going to stand. "Entertaining the masses is part of your job description, and sometimes that includes acting. If we'd known you were . . . unwilling . . . to do that, we wouldn't have signed you." Standing, he narrowed his eyes and took an intimidating stance above Kellan. "All I'm asking for here is for you to buck it up and do your fucking job. And in case you couldn't tell . . . I'm not really asking." His voice was ice cold; it raised the hair on the back of my neck and filled my stomach with lead. Shifting his focus from Kellan, Nick walked out of the room.</p><p>There was a thick layer of silence in the room after Nick left. You could have heard a pin drop. Not surprisingly, Griffin was the first to pop the stillness with a loud exclamation. "Dude! You get to film-fuck Sienna Sexton! High five!" He held his hand up in the air, palm exposed to Kellan in congratulations.</p><p>Still shocked at this turn of events, I had no comment to Griffin's statement. Kellan glared at the bassist, then seemed to realize that was pointless and shifted his gaze to the floor.</p><p>He was silent one moment longer, then abruptly stood. Staring at the door Nick had strode through, Kellan's face hardened. "This is bullshit."</p><p>He stormed out of the room, harshly brushing past my legs in the process. Evan stood in his wake. "Kellan?"</p><p>Kellan didn't answer him. Hands clenched into fists, he disappeared without a backwards glance at his band. We all stood and stared after him. "What's he gonna do?" Matt asked the room. No one had an answer, and a feeling of dread pricked my skin. I knew exactly what he was going to do. What he always did when things got too hard. He was going to run.</p><p>I took off after Kellan, the guys following after me. Kellan wasn't on the stairs, and for once the stunning view didn't impress me. Nothing was impressing me at the moment, because I was pretty sure I was going to have to do something I did not want to do. I was going to have to convince Kellan to make out with another woman. No, not just make out. Simulate a love scene. Somehow, that made the whole thing ten times worse.</p><p>I found Kellan in our room. Face stormy, he was shoving shirts in his bag. My empty bag lay beside his. A part of me wanted to start packing up my stuff in silent concession. That would be an infinitely easier choice. Instead, as Evan, Matt, and Griffin trailed into the room behind me, I asked, "What are you doing?"</p><p>Kellan glanced up at me, his eyes blazing. "Pack your stuff. We're going home. I'm done."</p><p>Griffin immediately burst out, "What the fuck, Kellan?"</p><p>Evan put a hand on Kellan's shoulder, trying to calm him down; Kellan shrugged him off. Matt quietly countered with, "We signed a contract, Kellan. We can't just walk away."</p><p>Kellan glared at Matt, snapping, "Then they can fucking sue us! I'm not whoring myself out for them. I'm going back to Pete's. Are you guys coming with me or not?" Knowing that all of this was ultimately because of me, my heart thudded in my chest in a painful staccato rhythm.</p><p>Griffin gaped at him. "You are the biggest fucking pussy-"</p><p>Kellan took two aggressive steps toward Griffin, silencing him. Evan stepped between the pair, his hands on Kellan's shoulders. Matt put a hand on Griffin's chest, keeping him back as well. There was suddenly so much tension in the air that I knew nothing constructive was going to happen while everyone was present. Kellan needed to be calmed down, not confronted. And, at the moment, I was the only one who could do it. I hated that the power was in my hands. Especially when going back to Pete's sounded like a fabulous idea.</p><p>Keeping my eyes locked on Kellan, I told the guys, "Could you give me a moment with my husband, please?"</p><p>Kellan snapped his eyes to mine, his expression still searing. Evan stepped away from Kellan, squeezing my arm before he left. Matt dragged Griffin out of the room, but not before Griffin shouted, "You talk some fucking sense into him, Kiera! This is bullshit!"</p><p>When I heard the door close, I took a step toward Kellan. With no one else in the room, Kellan's anger and frustration turned solely toward me. I was prepared for it, though; I'd been on the receiving end of vicious snarls from Kellan more than once. "You gonna call me a pussy too? Think I ought to go ahead and fuck Sienna, just to prove a point?"</p><p>I cringed a little, but let it slide off of my back. His anger wasn't really directed at me. Walking over to him, I grabbed his hands; they were still clenched into fists. "Kellan . . . you can't give up now."</p><p>Kellan pried a hand loose and pointed at the door. "Were you in that meeting? Did you hear what they want me to do?"</p><p>Grabbing his hand again, I nodded. "Yes, and it's okay." Just saying the words made my stomach tighten, but it had to be done.</p><p>Kellan gaped at me. "It's . . . okay? How is me 'film fucking' someone okay?"</p><p>Stepping into his body, I trailed my fingers up his arms and wrapped them around the back of his neck. He was rigid at first, but he gradually relaxed as I held him. "Well, all right, maybe 'okay' isn't the best word. The thought of you being with her is actually a little horrifying." Kellan's body started to tense again and I immediately told him, "But it's a necessary evil."</p><p>Kellan shook his head, his arms wrapping around my waist. "No, it isn't necessary." His anger draining, he rested his head against mine. "I don't want to hurt you. And I don't see how any of this won't hurt you."</p><p>Pulling back from him, I said, "And I don't want you to give up on your dream because of me." He shook his head, looking away from me, and I grabbed his cheek. "You're so close, so very close. Just do this one thing to jumpstart your career, to jumpstart the guys' careers. Then, when you've completed your contract terms and you're the most sought-after band in the industry, find another label. That will prove your point much better than . . . you know."</p><p>Kellan smirked at me, and I smiled at seeing some of his humor coming back. But the seriousness in his face returned as he exhaled a long breath. He didn't say anything for several seconds. I could see that his mind was churning, debating, and I gave him a moment to process everything that had just been thrown at him. When he did finally speak, his voice was quiet. "I don't want to let the guys down, I really don't, and I see what you're saying. But when I said I was through with other girls, I meant it. You're it for me. I don't want to touch her."</p><p>Stroking his skin with my thumb, I murmured, "I know. And I love you so much for that. But this doesn't have to affect us if we don't let it. You're still my husband. I'm still your wife. Acting like you feel differently on camera doesn't change any of that. Okay?"</p><p>Kellan slowly nodded, then sighed. "I'm not even sure if I can film a love scene with someone other than you."</p><p>Running a hand through his still slicked back hair, I husked, "Sure you can. Just pretend she's me. It wouldn't be the first time."</p><p>I gave him a wry smile so he would know I was teasing. He gave me a devilish grin in response. His face sobered instantly, though. "You really want me to do this?"</p><p>I bit my lip. Did I want this? No. I didn't want his body anywhere near Sienna's. But I wanted success for him, and for him to walk away now, over . . . this . . . seemed too great a price for him to pay. I nodded. "Yes, I do." Kellan closed his eyes, nodding once. I gave him a light kiss, hating that someone else would be touching that miraculous mouth soon. "And, Kellan"-his eyes cracked opened-"if this is really going to happen, I need to be there. I need to watch it."</p><p>His eyes sprang all the way open. "No."</p><p>I nodded, kissing him again. "I have to, Kellan."</p><p>"Why?" he murmured against my lips. "Why would you want to see that, Kiera?"</p><p>Because I'm a glutton for punishment. "Because it will be so much worse in my head if I don't."</p><p>"Kiera," he pleaded. "I don't want this, but if I have to do it, then I want you as far away from it as possible." Pushing my shoulder back, he squatted to look me in the eye. "I don't want to hurt you, and if our roles were reversed, I couldn't handle watching you with another man."</p><p>I gave him a sad smile as I whispered, "You already did."</p><p>Kellan's mouth parted, and a wave of sadness swept over his features. It broke my heart. "I love you," I told him, bringing my lips to his.</p><p>Doing my best to erase his sadness, I tasted his lips over and over. His breath eventually picked up as the passionate fire inside him sparked under my administrations. His hands came up to tangle in my hair, holding my head tight to his. His tongue passed over mine, teasing me, and a low moan disrupted the stillness of our bedroom. An erotic noise burrowed up from Kellan's chest, mixing with my breathy exhales. My impatient hands ran up and under his shirt. I needed all of the barriers between us gone. Now.</p><p>Kellan broke apart from me to help my eager fingers remove his shirt, then instantly sought my lips again once the material was free. I traced the lines and valleys I knew and loved so well. My fingers found the deep V of his lower abdomen, and I tugged on the waistband of his damp shorts, needing those off as well. Kellan helped me there too, and before I could really comprehend it, he was standing before me, completely bare and not the least bit self-conscious about it.</p><p>His eyes were hooded as mine roved over his body. He was mine, heart and soul. Sienna may have a brief moment with him-a very tiny, tiny, taste-but she would never have the full magnificence of this stunning man. I almost felt a little sorry for her. Almost.</p><p>Breath fast, I wrapped my arms around his neck and pulled him onto the bed. As soon as my back hit the mattress, he started stripping away my clothes. My damp shorts met up with his on the floor, my tankini briefs immediately following. His hands slid up my sides, taking my top with it, and I groaned when my chest was free. His mouth enclosed a nipple, and I delighted in something I knew he wouldn't be able to film with her. Not for a PG-13 music video.</p><p>Kellan, also reveling in what was his and his alone, moved my leg up his hip and immediately sank himself into me. I clutched him tight, groaning "Yes" a lot louder than I probably should have.</p><p>Kellan sucked in a breath through his teeth. "God, Kiera . . ." he murmured, before he began to move.</p><p>Maybe it was the wildly swinging emotions we'd been experiencing just before this moment, but every cell in my body felt energized, alive, and tingling with sensation. And I didn't hold anything back as Kellan and I rocked together. This was ours, and Sienna would never share in it. And even though she was nowhere near us, I let out my joy as if she could hear it.</p><p>Kellan did too. And it wasn't too much longer before we were both approaching the crest, our bodies lightly shaking, slightly damp from the exertion. As my climax burst through me, I raked my nails down Kellan's back. Not strong enough to draw blood, but strong enough that he would feel it for a while. My little reminder of who we were and what we'd been through. Kellan buried his head into my shoulder. He cried out as his body tensed, then released. I groaned as I felt him, heard him, was one with him.</p><p>No, Sienna would never have this. Her pale imitation of this moment wouldn't even come close.</p><p>Breath heavy, Kellan rolled to my side. I kissed his cheek and he smiled with his eyes still closed. I watched him as he recovered, mesmerized by him. His smile never faded, but his breathing slowed and evened. When his face relaxed and his breathing turned shallow, I realized that I'd relaxed him right into sleep. That gave me a strange feeling of euphoria. But then I started thinking about Wednesday, and my earlier bravado faltered. Maybe Sienna wouldn't have this moment with him, but was I opening a can of worms by giving them a taste of each other? Was I making a monumental mistake by allowing this to happen?</p><p>Stealthily sliding out of bed, I folded the comforter around Kellan so he was covered. After putting on some clean, dry clothes, I picked up Kellan's phone from his nightstand and silently left my sleeping husband. When I got back into the main lounging area, I was expecting to see the other D-Bags waiting around to hear what Kellan had to say. But then my mind replayed the last few moments and I realized that Kellan and I had both been quite vocal, and they probably already knew that I had successfully changed his mind. My cheeks heated, but I ignored the embarrassment. At least no one had walked in on us this time.</p><p>Griffin came out of the community bathroom as I was making my way to the deck. I froze when I saw him, wondering what obscene comment he was going to make. With a look of pride on his face, he pointed at my closed bedroom door. "Did you just fuck him into submission?" He held his knuckles up to me. "Nice."</p><p>My initial reaction was to scoff, call him a pig, and storm off in a mortified huff. But I'd promised myself that I'd make an attempt to be nice to him, so I shrugged and made myself talk to him. "I changed his mind about doing the video, but . . . now I'm worried that I made a mistake."</p><p>As Griffin ran a hand through his hair, I realized that this was the first conversation I'd ever really had with him. It was odd, and I had no idea what he would say, or if I would find it offensive or not.</p><p>He made a dismissive sound with his lips. "Nah, don't worry about it. You guys aren't into sharing, so he won't really do anything with her." He winked at me, and I strangely found it charming instead of creepy. "Kell knows what side his dick's buttered on."</p><p>Feeling oddly reassured by his absurd expression, I muttered, "Thank you . . . I think."</p><p>Griffin laughed as he left the room. "Anytime, Kiera."</p><p>Shaking my head, I began to wonder if I'd just entered into some strange sort of opposite world, where I encouraged Kellan to make out with other women and found advice from Griffin comforting. What else was going to happen? Anna and Denny hook up and decide to get married and raise Griffin's baby as their own? That made me laugh as I walked outside. No, no way would those two ever get together. Anna would eat Denny alive.</p><p>Palms sweaty, I started pacing near the railing. I had a view of the backyard pool and could see Matt and Evan near the edge, both of them chatting on their cell phones, most likely to Rachel and Jenny. Probably telling them the exciting news about their music video with Sienna Sexton. Internally groaning, I pulled up Kellan's contact list and scrolled through until I found Sienna's number. Kellan was mine, and I wasn't just going to roll over and let somebody else nab him from me.</p><p>She picked up almost immediately. "Kellan, what a wonderful surprise. What can I do for you, love?"</p><p>I bristled at her charming term of endearment, but tried not to think too much of it. She called everyone "love." "Um, actually, this is Kiera. I'm borrowing Kellan's phone."</p><p>"Oh, well, what can I do for you, Kiera?" There was a small trace of disappointment in her accent, but she covered it well with bubbly politeness.</p><p>"I just wanted to let you know that I talked Kellan into doing the music video with you," I said.</p><p>She couldn't hide the disappointment this time. "He didn't want to do the video?"</p><p>I sighed, hating that I had to placate both sides. "He wasn't okay with the direction the director wanted to take it, filming a love scene with you. But I told him . . . it was fine."</p><p>"He had to ask for your permission? How . . . quaint." Her amusement was evident. Sienna Sexton probably didn't ask permission for anything.</p><p>I hesitated, not really wanting to defend Kellan's actions. And that wasn't really the point of my phone call anyway. "Well, the fact that he's agreed to do it is all that's important. But, I just wanted to know . . ." I inhaled a deep breath. Here goes nothing. "Did I make a mistake encouraging him to film an intimate scene with you? You're used to getting what you want. Woman to woman, be honest with me . . . do you want my husband?"</p><p>There was a long pause on Sienna's end. My stomach twisted into a knot that I was positive I would never be able to untangle as I waited for her to say yes. When she did, it came as no surprise. "Yes, I do . . . but not in the way you think." I blinked. That did surprise me. Call me naive, but what other way was there?</p><p>Sienna continued before I could ask. "My career has hit a . . . stalling point. I need Kellan to refuel it. Being in the tabloids with him just this short while has done wonders for me. I've already received collaboration offers from other musicians, and just yesterday, I was handed a movie script." As her words sank in, she added, "So, yes, I want him . . . desperately . . . but only for the buzz."</p><p>"Oh," I murmured.</p><p>"Did you need anything else from me, love?"</p><p>My mind still spinning, I told her, "No . . . that was it. Thank you for being honest."</p><p>"Sure thing. Ta-ta!" She clicked off the line, and I stared at Kellan's phone for long seconds. Did I believe her? Could I trust her? Only time would tell.</p> </div> </div> <div class="row turn-page"> <a class="col-xs-2" href="/Reckless%20(Thoughtless%20%233)/9.html?v=1662298309104">Previous</a> <a class="col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:center;" href="/Reckless%20(Thoughtless%20%233)/book.html?v=1662298309103">Table</a> <a class="col-xs-2 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:right;" href="/Reckless%20(Thoughtless%20%233)/11.html?v=1662298309105"> Next</a> </div> <hr></div><hr><footer class="container"> <p>© Company 2014</p></footer><amp-lightbox id="searchLightbox" class="-il" layout="nodisplay" on="lightboxOpen:searchInput.focus; lightboxClose:searchTriggerOpen.focus" scrollable="" hidden="hidden"> <div> <div class="-ic" role="button" tabindex="0" on="tap:searchLightbox.close"></div> <div class="-ih"> <div class="-sg -sb" on="tap: searchLightbox.close, AMP.setState({ query: '' }), searchForm.clear" role="button" tabindex="0"> <div class="ap-a-ico -sw"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#close"></use> </svg> </div> </div> <div class="ap-o-search-field"> <form action="#" action-xhr="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/echo" class="-ip" id="searchForm" on="submit:AMP.setState({ query: throttledValue }),searchResult.focus" target="_top"> <amp-autocomplete class="-id" filter="substring" min-characters="1" on="select:AMP.setState({ query: event.value })" submit-on-enter="false" src="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/autosuggest"> <div class="ap-a-ico -im"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#search"></use> </svg> </div> <input id="searchInput" class="-iv" name="q" placeholder="What are you looking for?" on="input-throttled:AMP.setState({ throttledValue: event.value })" required=""> <button class="-ig" type="submit" name="search-submit" disabled="" [disabled]="!throttledValue">Search </button> <div role="listbox"></div> </amp-autocomplete> </form> <div class="empty" [class]="query ?
