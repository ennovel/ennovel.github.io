He did not know what to make of Amadiro and he had not expected this confusion within himself. Gremionis' had described him as "standoffish." From what Cicis had said, he expected Amadiro to be autocratic. In person, however, Amadiro seemed jovial, outgoing, even friendly. Yet if his words were to be trusted, Amadiro was calmly moving to end the investigation. He was doing it pitilessly - and with what seemed to be commiserating smile.</p><p>What was he?</p><p>Automatically, Baley glanced toward the niches where Giskard and Daneel were standing, the primitive Giskard of course without expression, the advanced Daneel calm and quiet. That Daneel had ever met Amadiro in his short existence was, on the face of it, unlikely. Giskard, on the other hand, in his how many decades of life might very well have met him.</p><p>Baley's lips tightened as he thought he might have asked Giskard in advance what Amadiro might be like. He might, in that case, be now better able to judge how much of this roboticist's present persona was real and how much was cleverly calculated.</p><p>Why on Earth - or off it, Baley wondered, didn't he use these robotic resources of his more intelligently? Or why didn't Giskard volunteer information - but no, that was unfair. Giskard clearly lacked the capacity for independent activity of that sort. He would yield information on request, Baley thought, but would produce none on his own initiative.</p><p>Amadiro followed the brief flicking of Baley's eyes and said, "I'm one against three, I think. As you see, I have none of my robots here in my office - although any number are on instant call, I admit - while you have two of Fastolfe's robots: the old reliable Giskard and that marvel of design, Daneel."</p><p>"You know them both, I see," said Baley.</p><p>"By reputation only. I actually see them - I, a roboticist, was about to say 'in the flesh' - I actually see them physically for the first time now, although I saw Daneel portrayed by an actor in that hyperwave show."</p><p>"Everyone in all the worlds has apparently seen that hyperwave show," said Baley glumly. "It makes my life - as a real and limited individual - difficult."</p><p>"Not with me," said Amadiro, his smile broadening. "I assure you I did not take your fictional representation with any seriousness whatever. I assumed you were limited in real life. And so you are - or you would not have indulged so freely in unwarranted accusations on Aurora."</p><p>"Dr. Amadiro," said Baley, "I assure you I was making no formal accusations. I was merely pursuing an investigation and considering possibilities."</p><p>"Don't misunderstand me," said Amadiro with sudden earnestness. "I don't blame you. I am sure that you were behaving perfectly by Earth standards. It is just that you are up against Auroran standards now. We treasure reputation with unbelievable intensity."</p><p>"If that were so, Dr. Amadiro, then haven't you and other Globalists been slandering Dr. Fastolfe with suspicion, to a far greater extent than any small thing I have done?"</p><p>"Quite true," agreed Amadiro, "but I am an eminent Auroran and have a certain influence, while you are an Earthman and have no influence whatever. That is most unfair, I admit, and I deplore it, but that is the way the worlds are. What can we do? Besides, the accusation against Fastolfe can be maintained - and will be maintained - and slander isn't slander when it is the truth. Your mistake was to make accusations that simply can't be maintained, I'm sure you must admit that neither Mr. Gremionis nor Dr. Vasilia Aliena - nor both together - could possibly have disabled poor Jander."</p><p>"I did not formally accuse either."</p><p>"Perhaps not, but you can't hide behind the word formally, on Aurora. It's too bad Fastolfe didn't warn you of this when he brought you in to take up this investigation, this - as it now is, I'm afraid - ill-fated investigation."</p><p>Baley felt the corner of his mouth twitch as he thought that Fastolfe might indeed have warned him.</p><p>He said, "Am I to get a hearing in the matter or is it all settled?"</p><p>"Of course you will get a hearing before being condemned. We are not barbarians here on Aurora. The Chairman will consider the memo I have sent him, together with my own suggestions in the matter. He will probably consult Fastolfe as the other party intimately concerned and then arrange to meet with all three of us, perhaps tomorrow. Some decision might be reached then - or later - and it would be ratified by the full Legislature. All due process of law will be followed, I assure you."</p><p>"The letter of the law will be followed, no doubt, but what if the Chairman has already made up his mind, what if nothing I say will be accepted, and what if I the Legislature simply rubber-stamps a foregone decision? Is that possible?"</p><p>Amadiro did not exactly smile at that, but he seemed subtly amused. "You are a realist, Mr. Baley. I am pleased with that. People who dream of justice are so apt to be disappointed and they are usually such wonderful people, that one hates to see that happen."</p><p>Amadiro's glance fixed itself on Daneel again. "A remarkable job, this humaniform robot," he said. "It is astonishing how close to his vest Fastolfe has kept things. And it is a shame that Jander was lost. There Fastolfe did the unforgivable."</p><p>"Dr. Fastolfe, sir, denies that he was in any way implicated."</p><p>"Yes, Mr. Baley, of course he would. Does he say that I am implicated? Or is my implication entirely your own idea?"</p><p>Baley said deliberately, "I have no such idea. I merely wish to question you on the matter. As for Dr. Fastolfe, he is not a candidate for one of your accusations of slander. He is certain you have had nothing to do with what happened to Jander because he is quite certain, you lack the knowledge and capacity to immobilize a humaniform robot."</p><p>If Baley hoped to stir things up in that manner, he failed.</p><p>Amadiro accepted the slur with no loss of good humor and said, "In that he is right, Mr. Baley. Sufficient ability is not to be found in any roboticist - alive or dead - except for Fastolfe himself. Isn't that what he says, our modest master - of masters?"</p><p>"Yes, he does."</p><p>"Then whatever does he say happened to Jander, I wonder?"</p><p>"A random event. Purely chance."</p><p>Amadiro laughed. "Has he calculated the probability of such a random event?"</p><p>"Yes, Master Roboticist. Yet even an extremely unlikely chance might happen, especially if there were incidents that bettered the odds."</p><p>"Such as what?"</p><p>"That is what I am hoping to find out. Since you have already arranged to have me thrown off the planet, do you now intend to forestall any questioning of yourself - or may I continue my investigation until such time as my activity in that respect is legally ended? - Before you answer, Dr. Amadiro, please consider that the investigation has not as yet been legally ended and, in any hearing that may come up, whether tomorrow or later, I will be able to accuse you of refusing to answer my questions if you should insist on now ending this interview. That might influence the Chairman in his decision."</p><p>"It would not, my dear Mr. Baley. Don't imagine you can in any way interfere with me. - However, you may interview me for as long as you wish. I will cooperate fully with you, if only to enjoy the spectacle of the good Fastolfe trying uselessly to disentangle himself from his unfortunate deed. I am not extraordinarily vindictive, Mr. Baley, but the fact that Jander was Fastolfe's own creation does not give him the right to destroy it."</p><p>Baley said, "It is not legally established that this is what he has done, so that what you have just said is, at least potentially, slander. Let us put that to one side, therefore, and go on with this interview. I need information. I will ask my questions briefly and directly and, if you answer in the same way, this interview may be completed quickly."</p><p>"No, Mr. Baley. It is not you who will say the conditions for this interview," said Amadiro. "I take it that one or both of your robots is equipped to record our conversation in full."</p><p>"I believe so."</p><p>"I know so. I have a recording device of my own as well. Don't think, my good Mr. Baley, that you will lead me through a jungle of short answers to something that will serve Fastolfe's purpose. I will answer as I choose and make certain I am not misinterpreted. And my own recording will help me make it certain that I am not misinterpreted." Now, for the first time, there was the suggestion of the wolf behind Amadiro's attitude of friendliness.</p><p>"Very well, then, but if your answers are deliberately longwinded and evasive, that, too, will show up in the recording."</p><p>"Obviously."</p><p>"With that understood, may I have a glass of water, to begin with?"</p><p>"Absolutely. - Giskard, will you oblige Mr. Baley?"</p><p>Giskard was out of his niche at once. There was the inevitable tinkle of ice at the bar at one end of the room and a tall glass of water was on the desk immediately before Baley.</p><p>Baley said, "Thank you, Giskard," and waited for him to move back into his niche.</p><p>He said, "Dr. Amadiro, am I correct in considering you the head of the Robotics Institute?"</p><p>"Yes, you are."</p><p>"And its founder?"</p><p>"Correct. - You see, I answer briefly."</p><p>"How long has it been in existence?"</p><p>"As a concept - decades. I have been gathering like-minded people for at least fifteen years. Permission was obtained from the Legislature twelve years ago. Building began nine years ago and active work began six years ago. In its present completed form, the Institute is two years old and there are long range plans for further expansion, eventually. - There you have a long answer, sir, but presented reasonably concisely."</p><p>"Why did you find it necessary to set up the Institute?"</p><p>"Ah, Mr. Baley. Here you surely expect nothing but a long winded answer."</p><p>"As you please, sir."</p><p>At this point, a robot brought in a tray of small sandwiches and still smaller pastries, none of which were familiar to Baley. He tried a sandwich and found it crunchy and not exactly unpleasant but odd enough for him to finish it only with an effort. He washed it down with what was left of his water.</p><p>Amadiro watched with a kind of gentle amusement and said, "You must understand, Mr. Baley, that we Aurorans are unusual people. So are Spacers generally, but I speak of Aurorans in particular now. We are descended from Earthpeople something most of us do not willingly think about - but we are self selected."</p><p>"What does that mean, sir?"</p><p>"Earthpeople have long lived on an increasingly crowded planet and have drawn together into still more crowded cities that finally became the beehives and anthills you call Cities with a capital 'C.' What kind of Earthpeople, then, would leave Earth and go to other worlds that are empty and hostile so that they might build new societies from nothing, societies that they could not enjoy in completed form in their own lifetime - trees that would still be saplings when they died, so to speak."</p><p>"Rather unusual people, I suppose."</p><p>"Quite unusual. Specifically, people who are not so dependent on crowds of their fellows as to lack the ability to face emptiness. People who even prefer emptiness, who would like to work on their own and face problems by themselves, rather than hide in the herd and share the burden so that their own load is virtually nothing. Individualists, Mr. Baley. Individualists!"</p><p>"I see that."</p><p>"And our society is founded on that. Every direction in which the Spacer worlds have developed further emphasizes our individuality. We are proudly human on Aurora, rather than being huddled sheep on Earth. - Mind you, Mr. Baley, I use the metaphor not as way of deriding Earth. It is simply a different society which I find unadmirable but which you, I suppose, find comforting and ideal."</p><p>"What has this to do with the founding of the Institute, Dr. Amadiro?"</p><p>"Even proud and healthy individualism has its drawbacks. The greatest minds - working singly, even for centuries - cannot progress rapidly if they refuse to communicate their findings. A knotty puzzle may hold up a scientist for a century, when it may be that a colleague has the solution already and is not even aware of the puzzle that it might solve. - The Institute is an attempt, in the narrow field of robotics at least, to introduce a certain community of thought."</p><p>"Is it possible that the particular knotty puzzle you are attacking is that of the construction of a humaniform robot?"</p><p>Amadiro's eyes twinkled. "Yes, that is obvious, isn't it? It was twenty-six years ago that Fastolfe's new mathematical system, which he calls 'intersectional analysis,' made it possible to design humaniform robots - but he kept the system to himself. Years afterward, when all the difficult technical details were worked out, he and Dr. Sarton applied the theory to the design of Daneel. Then Fastolfe alone completed Jander. But all of those details were kept secret, also.</p><p>"Most roboticists shrugged and felt that this was natural. They could only try, individually, to work out the details for themselves. I, on the other hand, was struck by the possibility of an Institute in which efforts would be pooled. It wasn't easy to persuade other roboticists of the usefulness of the plan, or to persuade the Legislature to fund it against Fastolfe's formidable opposition, or to persevere through the years of effort, but here we are."</p><p>Baley said, "Why was Dr. Fastolfe opposed?"</p><p>"Ordinary self-love, to begin with - and I have no fault to find with that, you understand. All of us have a very natural self-love. It comes with the territory of individualism. The point is that Fastolfe considers himself the greatest roboticist in history and also considers the humaniform robot his own particular achievement. He doesn't want that achievement duplicated by a group of roboticists, individually faceless compared to himself. I imagine he viewed it as a conspiracy of inferiors to dilute and deface his own great victory."</p><p>"You say that was his motive for opposition 'to begin with.' That means there were other motives. What were they?"</p><p>"He also objects to the uses to which we plan to put the humaniform robots."</p><p>"What uses are these, Dr. Amadiro?"</p><p>"Now, now. Let's not be ingenuous. Surely Dr. Fastolfe has told you of the Globalist plans for settling the Galaxy?"</p><p>"That he has and, for that matter, Dr. Vasilia has spoken to me of the difficulties of scientific advance among individualists. However, that does not stop me from wanting to hear your views on these matters. Nor should it stop you from wanting to tell me. For instance, do you want me to accept Dr. Fastolfe's interpretation of Globalist plans as unbiased and impartial - and would you state that for the record? Or would, you prefer to describe your plans in your own words?"</p><p>"Put that way, Mr. Baley, you intend to give me no choice."</p><p>"None, Dr. Amadiro."</p><p>"Very well. I - we, I should say, for the people at the Institute are like-minded in this - look into the future and wish to see humanity opening ever more and ever newer planets to settlement. We do not, however, want the process of self-selection to destroy the older planets or to reduce them to moribundity am in the case - pardon me - of Earth. We don't want the new planets to take the best of us and to leave behind the dregs. You see that, don't you?"</p><p>"Please go on."</p><p>"In any robot-oriented society, as in the case of our own, the easy solution is to send out robots as settlers. The robots will build the society and the world and we can then all follow later without selection, for the new world will be as comfortable and as adjusted to ourselves as the old worlds were, so that we can go on to new worlds without leaving home, so to speak."</p><p>"Won't the robots create robot worlds rather than human worlds?"</p><p>"Exactly, if we send out robots that are nothing but robots. We have, however, the opportunity of sending out humaniform robots like Daneel here, who, in creating worlds for themselves, would automatically create worlds for us. Dr. Fastolfe, however, objects to this. He finds some virtue in the thought of human beings carving a new world out of a strange and forbidding planet and does not see that the effort to do so would not only cost enormously in human life, but would also create a world molded by catastrophic events into something not at all like the worlds we know."</p><p>"As the Spacer worlds today are different from Earth and from each other?"</p><p>Amadiro, for a moment, lost his joviality and looked thoughtful. "Actually, Mr. Baley, you touch an important point. I am discussing Aurora only. The Spacer worlds do indeed differ among themselves and I am not overly fond of most of them. It is clear to me - though I may be prejudiced - that Aurora, the oldest among them, is also the best and most successful. I don't want a variety of new worlds of which only a few might be really valuable. I want many Auroras - uncounted millions of Auroras - and for that reason I want new worlds carved into Auroras before human beings go there. That's why we call ourselves 'Globalists' by the way. We are concerned with this globe of ours - Aurora - and no other."</p><p>"Do you see no value in variety, Dr. Amadiro?"</p><p>"If the varieties were equally good, perhaps there would be value, but if some - or most - are inferior, how would that benefit humanity?"</p><p>"When do you start this work?"</p><p>"When we have the humaniform robots with which to do it. So far there were Fastolfe's two, of which he destroyed one, leaving Daneel the only specimen." His eyes strayed briefly to Daneel as he spoke.</p><p>"When will you have humaniform robots?"</p><p>"That is difficult to say. We have not yet caught up with Dr. Fastolfe."</p><p>"Even though he is one and you are many, Dr. Amadiro?"</p><p>Amadiro twitched his shoulders slightly. "You waste your sarcasm, Mr. Baley. Fastolfe was well ahead of us to begin with and, though the Institute has been in embryo for a long time, we have been fully at work for only two years. Besides, it will be necessary for us not only to catch up with Fastolfe but to move ahead of him. Daneel is a good product, but he is only a prototype and is not good enough."</p><p>"In what way must the humaniform robots be improved beyond Daneel's mark?"</p><p>"They must be even more human, obviously. They must exist in both sexes and there must be the equivalent of children. We must have a generational spread if a sufficiently human society is to be built up on the planets."</p><p>"I think I see difficulties, Dr. Amadiro."</p><p>"No doubt. There are many. Which difficulties do you foresee, Mr. Baley?"</p><p>"If your produce humaniform robots who are so humaniform they can produce a human society, and if they are produced with a generational spread, in both sexes, how will you be able to distinguish them from human beings?"</p><p>"Will that matter?"</p><p>"It might. If such robots are too human, they might melt into Auroran society and become part of human family groups and might not be suitable for service as pioneers."</p><p>Amadiro laughed. "That thought clearly entered your head because of Gladia Delmarre's attachment to Jander. You see, I know something of your interview with that woman from my conversations with Gremionis and with Dr. Vasilia. I remind you that Gladia is from Solaria and her notion of what constitutes a husband is not necessarily Auroran in nature."</p><p>"I was not thinking of her in particular. I was thinking that sex on Aurora is broadly interpreted and that robots as sex partners are tolerated even now, with robots who are - only approximately humaniform. If you really cannot tell a robot from a human being - "</p><p>"There's the question of children. Robots can neither father nor mother children."</p><p>"But that brings up another point. The robots will be long-lived, since the proper building of the society may take centuries."</p><p>"They would, in any case, have to be long-lived if they are to resemble Aurorans."</p><p>"And the children - also long-lived?"</p><p>Amadiro did not speak.</p><p>Baley said, "These will be artificial robot children and will never grow older - they will not age and mature. Surely this will create an element sufficiently nonhuman to cast the nature of the society into doubt."</p><p>Amadiro sighed. "You are penetrating, Mr. Baley. It is indeed our thought to devise some scheme whereby robots can produce babies who can in some fashion grow and mature - at least long enough to establish the society we want."</p><p>"And then, when human beings arrive, the robots can be restored to more robotic schemes of behavior."</p><p>"Perhaps - if that seems advisable."</p><p>"And this production of babies? Clearly, it would be best if the system used were as close to the human as possible, wouldn't it?"</p><p>"Possibly."</p><p>"Sex, fertilization, birth?"</p><p>"Possibly."</p><p>"And, if these robots form a society so human that they cannot be differentiated from human, then, when true human beings arrive, might it not be that the robots would resent the immigrants and try to keep them off? Might the robots not react to Aurorans as you react to Earthpeople?"</p><p>"Mr. Baley, the robots would still be bound by the Three Laws."</p><p>"The Three Laws speak of refraining from injuring human beings and of obeying human beings."</p><p>"Exactly."</p><p>"And what if the robots are so close to human beings that they regard themselves as the human beings they should protect and obey? They might, very rightly, place themselves above the immigrants."</p><p>"My good Mr. Baley, why are you so concerned with all these things? They are for the far future. There will be solutions, as we progress in time and as we understand, by observation, what the problems really are."</p><p>"It may be, Dr. Amadiro, that Aurorans may not very much approve what you are planning, once they understand what it is. They may prefer Dr. Fastolfe's views."</p><p>"Indeed? Fastolfe thinks that if Aurorans cannot settle new planets directly and without the help of robots, then Earthpeople should be encouraged to do so."</p><p>Baley said, "It seems to me that that makes good sense."</p><p>"Because you are an Earthman, my good Baley. I assure you that Aurorans would not find it pleasant to have Earthpeople swarming over the new worlds, building new beehives and forming some sort of Galactic Empire in their trillions and quadrillions and reducing the Spacer worlds to what? To insignificance at best and to extinction at worst."</p><p>"But the alternative to that is worlds of humaniform robots, building quasi-human societies and allowing no true human beings among themselves. There would gradually develop a robotic Galactic Empire, reducing the Spacer worlds to insignificance at best and to extinction at worst. Surely Aurorans would prefer a human Galactic Empire to a robotic one."</p><p>"What makes you so sure of that, Mr. Baley?"</p><p>"The form your society takes now makes me sure. I was told, on my way to Aurora, that no distinctions are made between robots and human beings on Aurora, but that is clearly wrong. It may be a wished - for ideal that Aurorans flatter themselves truly exists, but it does not."</p><p>"You've been here - what? - less than two days and you can already tell?"</p><p>"Yes, Dr. Amadiro. It may be precisely because I'm a stranger that I can see clearly. I am not blinded by custom and ideals. Robots are not permitted to enter Personals and that's one distinction that is clearly made. It permits human beings to find one place where they can be alone. You and I sit at our ease, while robots remain standing in their niches, as you see" - Baley waved his arm toward Daneel - "which is another distinction. I think that human beings - even Aurorans - will always be eager to make distinctions and to preserve their own humanity."</p><p>"Astonishing, Mr. Baley."</p><p>"Not astonishing at all, Dr. Amadiro. You have lost. Even if you manage to foist your belief that Dr. Fastolfe destroyed Jander upon Aurorans generally, even if you reduce Dr. Fastolfe to political impotence, even if you get the Legislature and the Auroran people to approve your plan of robot settlement, you will only have gained time. As soon as the Aurorans see the implications of your plan, they will turn against you. It might be better, then, if you put an end to your campaign against Dr. Fastolfe and meet with him to work out some compromise whereby the settlement of new worlds by Earthmen can be so arranged as to represent no threat to Aurora or to the Spacer worlds in general."</p><p>"Astonishing, Mr. Baley," said Amadiro a second time.</p><p>"You have no choice," said Baley flatly.</p><p>But Amadiro answered, in a leisurely and amused tone, "When I say your remarks are astonishing, I do not refer to the content of your statements but only to the fact that you make them at all - and that you think they are worth something."</p><p>56</p><p>Baley watched Amadiro forage for one last piece of pastry and put half of it into his mouth, clearly enjoying it.</p><p>"Very good," said Amadiro, "but I am a little too fond of eating. What was I saying? - Oh yes. Mr. Baley, do you think you have discovered a secret? That I have told you something that our world does not already know? That my plans are dangerous, but that I blab them to every newcomer? I imagine you may think that, if I talk to you long enough, I will surely produce some verbal folly that you will be able to make use of. Be assured that I am not likely to. My plans for ever more humaniform robots, for robot families, and for as human a culture as possible are all on record. They are available to the Legislature and to anyone who is interested."</p><p>Baley said, "Does the general public know?"</p><p>"Probably not. The general public has its own priorities and is more interested in the next meal, the next hyperwave show, the next space-soccer contest than in the - next century and the next millennium. Still, the general public, will be as glad to accept my plans, as are the intellectually minded who already know. Those who object will not be numerous enough to matter."</p>       <amp-ad

          </amp-ad><p>"Can you be certain of that?"</p><p>"Oddly enough, I can be. You don't understand, I'm afraid, the intensity of the feelings that Aurorans - and Spacers generally - have toward Earthpeople. I don't share those feelings, mind you, and I am, for instance, quite at ease with you. I don't have that primitive fear of infection, I don't imagine that you smell bad, I don't attribute to you all sorts of personality traits that I find offensive, I don't think that you and yours are plotting to take our lives or steal our property but the large majority of Aurorans have all these attitudes. It may not be very close to the surface and Aurorans may bring themselves to be very polite to individual Earthpeople who seem harmless, but put them to the test and all their hatred and suspicion will emerge. Tell them that Earthpeople are swarming over new worlds and will preempt the Galaxy and they will howl for Earth's destruction before such a thing can happen."</p><p>"Even if the alternative was a robot society?"</p><p>"Certainly. You don't understand how we feel about robots, either. We are familiar with them. We are at home with them."</p><p>"No. They are your servants. You feel superior to them and are at home with them only while that superiority is maintained. If you are threatened by an overturn, by having them become your superiors, you will react with horror."</p><p>"You say that only because that is how Earthpeople would react."</p><p>"No. You keep them out of the Personals. It is a symptom."</p><p>"They have no use for those rooms. They have their own facilities for washing and they do not excrete. - Of course, they are not truly humaniform. If they were, we might not make that distinction."</p><p>"You would fear them the more."</p><p>"Truly?" said Amadiro. "That's foolish. Do you fear Daneel? If I can trust that hyperwave show - and I admit I do not think I can - you developed a considerable affection for Daneel. You feel it now, don't you?"</p><p>Baley's silence was eloquent and Amadiro pursued his advantage.</p><p>"Right now," he said, "you are unmoved by the fact that Giskard is standing, silent and unresponsive, in an alcove, but can tell by small examples of body language that you are uneasy over the fact that Daneel is doing so, too. You feel he is too human in appearance to be treated as a robot. You don't fear him the more because he looks human."</p><p>"I am an Earthman. We have robots," said Baley, "but not a robot culture. You cannot judge from my case."</p><p>"And Gladia, who preferred Jander to human beings - "</p><p>"She is a Solarian. You cannot judge from her case, either."</p><p>"What case can you judge from, then? You are only guessing. To me, it seems obvious that, if a robot is human enough, he would be accepted as human. Do you demand proof that I am not a robot? The fact that I seem human is enough. In the end, we will not worry whether a new world is settled by Aurorans who are human in fact or in appearance, if no one can tell the difference. But - human or robot - the settlers will be Aurorans either way, not Earthpeople."</p><p>Baley's assurance faltered. He said unconvincingly, "What if you never learn how to construct a humaniform robot?"</p><p>"Why would you expect we would not? Notice that I say 'we.' There are many of us involved here."</p><p>"It may be that any number of mediocrities do not add up to one genius."</p><p>Amadiro said shortly, "We are not mediocrities. Fastolfe may yet find it profitable to come in with us."</p><p>"I don't think so."</p><p>"I do. He will not enjoy being without power in the Legislature and, when our plans for settling the Galaxy move ahead and he sees, that his opposition does not stop us, he will join us. It will be only human of him to do so."</p><p>"I don't think you will win out," said Baley.</p><p>"Because you think that somehow this investigation of yours will exonerate Fastolfe and implicate me, perhaps, or someone else."</p><p>"Perhaps," said Baley desperately.</p><p>Amadiro shook his head. "My friend, if I thought that anything you could do would spoil my plans, would I be sitting still and waiting for destruction?"</p><p>"You are not. You are doing everything you can to have this investigation aborted. Why would you do that if you were confident that nothing I could do would get in your way?"</p><p>"Well," said Amadiro, "you can get in my way by demoralizing some of the members of the Institute. You can't be dangerous, but you can be annoying - and I don't want that either. So, if I can, I'll put an end to the annoyance - but I'll do that in reasonable fashion, in gentle fashion, even. If you were actually dangerous - "</p><p>"What could you do, Dr. Amadiro, in that case?"</p><p>"I could have you seized and imprisoned until you were evicted. I don't think Aurorans generally would worry overmuch about what I might do to an Earthman."</p><p>Baley said, "You are trying to browbeat me and that won't work. You know very well you could not lay a hand on me with my robots present."</p><p>Amadiro said, "Does it occur to you that I have a hundred robots within call? What would yours do against them?"</p><p>"All hundred could not harm me. They cannot distinguish between Earthmen and Aurorans. I am human within the meaning of the Three Laws."</p><p>"They could hold you quite immobilized - without harming you - while your robots were destroyed."</p><p>"Not so," said Baley. "Giskard can hear you and, if you make a move to summon your robots, Giskard will have you immobilized. He moves very quickly and, once that happens, your robots will be helpless, even if you manage to call them. They will understand that any move against me will result in harm to you."</p><p>"You mean that Giskard will hurt me?"</p><p>"To protect me from harm? Certainly. He will kill you, if absolutely necessary."</p><p>"Surely you don't mean that."</p><p>"I do," said Baley. "Daneel and Giskard have orders to protect me. The First Law, in this respect, has been strengthened with all the skill Dr. Fastolfe can bring to the job - and with respect to me, specifically. I haven't been told this in so many words, but I'm quite sure it's true. If my robots must choose between harm to you and harm to me, Earthman though I am, it will be easy for them to choose harm to you. I imagine you are well aware that Dr. Fastolfe is not very eager to ensure your well-being."</p><p>Amadiro chuckled and a grin wreathed his face. "I'm sure you're right in every respect, Mr. Baley, but it is good to have you say so. You know, my good sir, that I am recording this conversation also - I told you so at the start - and I'm glad of it. It is possible that Dr. Fastolfe will erase the last part of this conversation, but I assure you I won't. It is clear from what you have said that he is quite prepared to devise a robotic way of doing harm to me - even kill me, if he can manage that whereas it cannot be said from anything in this conversation or any other - that I plan any physical harm to him whatever or even to you. Which of us is the villain, Mr. Baley? - I think you have established that, and I think, then, that this is a good place at which to end the interview."</p><p>He rose, still smiling, and Baley, swallowing hard, stood up as well, almost automatically.</p><p>Amadiro said, "I still have one thing to say, however. It has nothing to do with our little contretemps here on Aurora - Fastolfe's and mine. Rather, with your own problem, Mr. Baley."</p><p>"My problem?"</p><p>"Perhaps I should say Earth's problem. I imagine, that you feel very anxious to save poor Fastolfe from his own folly because you think that will give your planet a chance for expansion. - Don't think so, Mr. Baley. You are quite wrong, rather arsyvarsy, to use a vulgar expression I've come across in some of your planet's historical novels."</p><p>"I'm not familiar with that phrase," said Baley stiffly.</p><p>"I mean you have the situation reversed. You see, when my view wins out in the legislature - and note that I say 'when' and not 'if' - Earth will be forced to remain in her own planetary system, I admit, but that will actually be to her benefit. Aurora will have the prospect of expansion and of establishing an endless empire. If we then know that Earth will merely be Earth, and never anything more, of what concern will she be to us? With the Galaxy at our disposal we will not begrudge Earthpeople their one world. We would even be disposed to make Earth as comfortable a world for her people, as would be practical.</p><p>"On the other hand, Mr. Baley, if Aurorans do what Fastolfe asks and allow Earth to send out settling parties, then it won't be long before it will occur to an increasing number of us that Earth will take over the Galaxy and that we will be encircled and hemmed in, that we will be doomed to decay, and death. After that, there will be nothing I can do. My own quite kindly feeling toward Earthmen will not be able to withstand the general kindling of Auroran suspicion and prejudice and it will then be very bad for Earth.</p><p>"So if, Mr. Baley, you are truly concerned for your own people, you should be very anxious indeed for Fastolfe not to succeed in foisting upon this planet his - very misguided plan. You should be a strong ally of mine. Think about it. I tell you this, I assure you, out of a sincere friendship and liking for you and for your planet."</p><p>Amadiro was smiling as broadly as ever, but it was all wolf now.</p><p>57</p><p>Baley and his robots followed Amadiro, out the room and along the corridor.</p><p>Amadiro stopped at one inconspicuous door and said, "Would you care to use the facilities before leaving?"</p><p>For a moment, Baley frowned in confusion, for he did not understand. Then he remembered the antiquated phrase Amadiro had used, thanks to his own reading of historical novels.</p><p>He said, "There was an ancient general, whose name l have forgotten, who, mindful of the exigencies of sudden absorption in military affairs, once said, 'Never turn down a chance to piss.'"</p><p>Amadiro, smiled broadly and said, "Excellent advice. Quite as good as my advice to think seriously about what I have said. - But I notice that you hesitate, even so. Surely you don't think I am laying a trap for you. Believe me, I am not a barbarian. You are my guest in this building and, for that reason alone, you are perfectly safe."</p><p>Baley said cautiously, "If I hesitate, it is because I am considering the propriety of using your - uh - facilities, considering that I am not an Auroran."</p><p>"Nonsense, my dear Baley. What is your alternative? Needs must. Please make use of it. Let that be a symbol that I myself am not subject to the general Auroran prejudices and wish you and Earth well."</p><p>"Could you go a step further?"</p><p>"In what way, Mr. Baley?"</p><p>"Could you show me that you are also superior to this planet's prejudice against robots - "</p><p>"There is no prejudice against robots," said Amadiro, quickly.</p><p>Baley nodded his head solemnly in apparent acceptance of the remark and completed his sentence - "by allowing them to enter the Personal with me. I have grown to feel uncomfortable without them."</p><p>For one moment, Amadiro seemed shaken. He recovered almost at once and said, with what was almost a scowl, "By all means, Mr. Baley."</p><p>"Yet whoever is now inside might object strenuously. I would not want to create scandal."</p><p>"No one is in there. It is a one-person Personal and, if, someone were making use of it, the in-use signal would indicate that."</p><p>"Thank you, Dr. Amadiro," said Baley. He opened the door and said, "Giskard, please enter."</p><p>Giskard clearly hesitated, but said nothing in objection and entered. At a gesture from Baley, Daneel followed, but as he passed through the door, he took Baley's elbow and pulled him in as well.</p><p>Baley said, as the door closed behind him, "I'll be out again soon. Thank you for allowing this."</p><p>He entered the room with as much unconcern as he could manage and yet he felt a tightness in the pit of his abdomen. Might it contain some unpleasant surprise?</p><p>58</p><p>Baley found the Personal empty, however. There was not even much to search. It was smaller than the one in Fastolfe's establishment.</p><p>Eventually, he noticed Daneel and Giskard standing silently side by side, backs against the door, as though endeavoring to have entered the room by the least amount possible.</p><p>Baley tried to speak normally, but what came out was a dim croak. He cleared his throat with unnecessary noise and said, "You can come farther into the room - and you needn't remain silent, Daneel." (Daneel had been on Earth. He knew the Earthly taboo against speech in the Personal.)</p><p>Daneel displayed that knowledge at once. He put his forefinger to his lips.</p><p>Baley said, "I know, I know, but forget it. If Amadiro can forget the Auroran taboo about robots in Personals, I can forget the Earthly taboo about speech there."</p><p>"Will it not make you uncomfortable, Partner Elijah?" asked Daneel in a low voice.</p><p>"Not a bit," said Baley in an ordinary one. (Actually, speech felt different with Daneel - a robot. The sound of speech in a room such as this when, actually, no human being was present was not as horrifying as it might be. In fact, it was not horrifying at all when only robots were present, however humaniform one of them might be. Baley could not say so, of course. Though Daneel had no feelings a human being could hurt, Baley had feelings on his behalf.)</p><p>And then Baley thought of something else and felt, quite intensely, the sensation of being a thoroughgoing fool.</p><p>"Or," he said to Daneel, in a voice that was suddenly very low indeed, "are you suggesting silence because this room is bugged?" The last word came out merely as a shaping of the mouth.</p><p>"If you mean, Partner Elijah, that people outside this room can detect what is spoken inside this room through some sort of eavesdropping device, that is quite impossible."</p><p>"Why impossible?"</p><p>The toilet device flushed itself with quick and silent efficiency and Baley advanced toward the washbasin.</p><p>Daneel said, "On Earth, the dense packing of the Cities makes privacy impossible. Overhearing is taken for granted and to use a device to make overhearing more efficient might seem natural. If an Earthman wishes not to be overheard, he simply doesn't speak, which may be why silence is so mandatory in places where there is a pretense of privacy, as in the very rooms you call Personals.</p><p>"On Aurora, on the other hand, as on all the Spacer worlds, privacy is a true fact of life and is greatly valued. You remember Solaria and the diseased extremes to which it was carried there. But even on Aurora, which is no Solaria, every human being is insulated from every other human being by the kind of space extension unthinkable on Earth and by a wall of robots, in addition. To break down that privacy would be an unthinkable act."</p><p>Baley said, "Do you mean it would be a crime to bug this room?"</p><p>"Much worse, Partner Elijah. It would not be the act of a civilized Auroran gentleman."</p><p>Baley looked about. Daneel, mistaking the gesture, plucked a towel out of the dispenser, which might not have been instantly apparent to the other's unaccustomed eyes, and offered it to Baley.</p><p>Baley accepted the towel, but that was not the object of his questing glanced. It was a bug for which his eyes searched, for he found it difficult to believe that someone would forego an easy advantage on the ground that it would not be civilized behavior. It was, however, useless and Baley, rather despondently, knew it would be. He would not be able to detect an Auroran bug, even if one were there. He wouldn't know what to look for in a strange culture.</p><p>Whereupon he followed the course of another strand of suspicion in his mind. "Tell me, Daneel, since you know Aurorans better than I do, why do you suppose Amadiro is taking all this trouble with me? He talks to me at his leisure. He sees me out. He offers me the use of this room - something Vasilia would not have done. He seems to have all the time in the world to spend on me. Politeness?"</p><p>"Many Aurorans pride themselves on their politeness. It may be that Amadiro does. He has several times stressed that he is not a barbarian."</p><p>"Another question. Why do you think he was willing to have me bring you and Giskard into this room?"</p><p>"It seemed to me that that was to remove your suspicions that the offer of this room might conceal a trap."</p><p>"Why should he bother? Because he was concerned over the possibility of my experiencing unnecessary anxiety?"</p><p>"Another gesture of a civilized Auroran gentleman, I should imagine."</p><p>Baley shook his head. "Well, if this room is bugged and Amadiro can hear me, let him hear me. I don't consider him a civilized Auroran gentleman. He made it quite clear that, if I did not abandon my investigation, he would see to it that Earth as a whole would suffer. Is that the act of a civilized gentleman? Or of an incredibly brutal blackmailer?"</p><p>Daneel said, "An Auroran gentleman may find it necessary to utter threats, but if so, he would do it in a gentlemanly manner."</p><p>"As Amadiro did. It is, then, the manner and not the content of speech that marks the gentleman. But then, Daneel, you are a robot and therefore can not really criticize a human being, can you?"</p><p>Daneel said, "It would be difficult for me to do so. But may I ask a question, Partner Elijah? Why did you ask permission to bring friend Giskard and me into this room? It had seemed to me that you were reluctant, earlier, to believe you were in danger. Have you now decided that you are not safe except in our presence?"</p><p>"No, not at all, Daneel. I am now quite convinced that I am not in danger and have not been."</p><p>"Yet there was a distinctly suspicious cast about your actions, when you entered this room, Partner Elijah. You searched it."</p><p>Baley said, "Of course! I said I am not in danger, but I do not say there is no danger."</p><p>"I do not think I see the distinction, Partner Elijah," said Daneel.</p><p>"We will discuss it later, Daneel. I am still not certain as to whether this room is bugged or not."</p><p>Baley was by now quite done. He said, "Well, Daneel, I've been leisurely about this; I haven't rushed at all. Now I'm ready to go out again and I wonder if Amadiro is still waiting for us after all this time or whether he has delegated an underling to do the rest of the job of showing us out. After all, Amadiro is a busy man, and cannot spend all day with me. What do you think, Daneel?"</p><p>"It would be more logical if Dr. Amadiro had delegated the task."</p><p>"And you, Giskard? What do you think?"</p><p>"I agree with friend Daneel, though it is my experience that human beings do not always make what would seem the logical response."</p><p>Baley said, "For my part, I suspect, Amadiro is waiting for us quitter patiently. If something has driven him to waste this much time on us, I rather think that the driving force - whatever it might be - has not yet weakened."</p><p>"I do not know what might be the driving force you speak of, Partner Elijah," said Daneel.</p><p>"Nor I, Daneel," said Baley, "which bothers me a great deal. But let us open the door now and see."</p><p>59</p><p>Amadiro was waiting outside the door for them, precisely where Baley had left him. He smiled at them, showing no sign of impatience. Baley could not resist shooting a quiet I-told-you-so glance at Daneel, who responded with bland impassivity.</p><p>Amadiro said, "I rather regretted, Mr. Baley, that you had not left Giskard outside when you entered the Personal. I might have known him in times past, when Fastolfe and I were on better terms but somehow never did. Fastolfe was my teacher once, you know."</p><p>"Was he?" said Baley. "I didn't know that, as a matter of fact."</p><p>"No reason you should, unless you had been told - and, in the short time you've been on the planet, you can scarcely have had time to learn much in the way of this sort of trivia, I suppose. - Come now, it has occurred to me that you can scarcely think me hospitable if I do not take advantage of your being at the Institute to show you around."</p><p>"Really," said Baley, stiffening a bit. "I must - "</p><p>"I insist," said Amadiro, with something of a note of the imperious entering his voice. "You arrived on Aurora yesterday morning and I doubt that you will be staying on the planet much longer. This may be the only chance you will ever have of getting a glimpse of a modern laboratory doing research work on robotics."</p><p>He linked arms with Baley and continued to speak in familiar terms. ("Prattled" was the term that occurred to the astonished Baley.)</p><p>"You've washed," said Amadiro. "You've taken care of your needs. There may be other roboticists here whom you will wish to question and I would welcome that, since I am determined to show I have put no barriers in your way during the short time in which you will yet be permitted to conduct your investigation. In fact, there is no reason you can't have dinner with us."</p><p>Giskard said, "If I may interrupt, sir - "</p><p>"You may not!" said Amadiro with unmistakable firmness and the robot fell silent.</p><p>Amadiro said, "My dear Mr. Baley, I understand these robots. Who should know them better? - Except for the unfortunate Fastolfe, of course. Giskard, I am sure, was going to remind you of some appointment, some promise, some business - and there is no point in any of that. Since the investigation is about over, I promise you, none of what he was going to remind you of will have any significance. Let us forget all such nonsense and, for a brief time, be friends.</p><p>"You must understand, my good Mr. Baley," he went on, "that I am quite an aficionado of Earth and its culture. It is not the most popular of subjects on Aurora, but I find it fascinating. I am particularly interested in Earth's past history, the days when it had a hundred languages and Interstellar Standard had not yet been developed. - May I compliment you, by the way, on your own handling of Interstellar?</p><p>"This way, this way," he said, turning a corner. "We'll be coming to the pathway-simulation room, which has its own weird beauty, and we may have a mock-up in operation. Quite symphonic, actually. - But I was talking about your handling of Interstellar. It is one of the many Auroran superstitions concerning Earth, that Earthpeople speak an all, but incomprehensible version of Interstellar. When the show about you was produced, there were many who said that the actors could not be Earthpeople because they could be understood, yet I can understand you." He smiled as he said that.</p><p>"I've tried reading Shakespeare," he continued with a confidential air, "but I can't read him in the original, of course, and the translation is curiously flat. I can't help but believe that the fault lies with the translation and not with Shakespeare. I do better with Dickens and Tolstoy, perhaps because that is prose, although the names of the characters are, in both cases, virtually unpronounceable to me.</p><p>"What I'm trying to say, Mr. Baley, is that I'm a friend of Earth. I really am. I want what is best for it. Do you understand?" He looked at Baley and again the wolf showed in his twinkling eyes.</p><p>Baley raised his voice, forcing it between the softly running sentences of the other. "I'm afraid I cannot oblige you, Dr. Amadiro. I must be about my business and I have no further questions to ask of either you or anyone else here. If you - "</p><p>Baley paused. There was a faint and curious rumble of sound in the air. He looked up, startled. "What is that?"</p><p>"What is what?" asked Amadiro. "I sense nothing." He looked at the robots, who had been following the two human beings in grave silence. "Nothing!" he said forcefully. "Nothing."</p><p>Baley recognized that as the equivalent of an order. Neither robot could now claim to have heard the rumble in direct contradiction to a human being, unless Baley himself applied a counter-pressure - and he was sure he could not manage to do it skillfully enough in the face of Amadiro's professionalism.</p><p>Nevertheless, it didn't matter. He had heard something and he was not a robot; he would not be talked out of it. He said, "By your own statement, Dr. Amadiro, I have little time left me. That is all the more reason that I must - "</p><p>The rumble again. Louder.</p><p>Baley said, with a sharp, cutting edge to his voice, "That, I suppose, is precisely what you didn't hear before and what you don't hear now. Let me go, sir, or I will ask my robots for help."</p><p>Amadiro loosened his grip on Baley's upper arm at once. "My friend, you had but to express the wish. Come! I will take you to the nearest exit and, if ever you are on Aurora again, which seems unlikely in the extreme, please return and you may have the tour I promised you."</p><p>They were walking faster. They moved down the spiral ramp, out along a corridor to the commodious and now empty anteroom and the door by which they had entered.</p><p>The windows in the anteroom showed utterly dark. Could it be night already?</p><p>It wasn't. Amadiro muttered to himself, "Rotten weather! They've opacified the windows."</p><p>He turned to Baley, "I imagine it's raining. They predicted it and the forecasts can usually be relied on - always, when they're unpleasant."</p><p>The door opened and Baley jumped backward with a gasp. A cold wind gusted inward and against the sky - not black but a dull, dark gray - the tops of trees were whipping back and forth.</p><p>There was water pouring, from the sky - descending in streams.
