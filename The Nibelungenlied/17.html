The very direst woes befell fair women from a lie. They gained leave to come before the king and say that they were Liudeger’s men, whom Siegfried’s hand had conquered afore and had brought as hostages to Gunther’s land. He greeted then the messengers and bade them go and seat them. One among them spake: “My lord, pray let us stand till we have told the message we do bear you. This know, ye have of a truth many a mother’s son as foe. Liudegast and Liudeger, whom ye one time gave grievous sores, declare a feud against you and are minded to ride with an army to this land.” The king waxed wroth when he heard This tale.
<br> 
<br> Men bade lead the perjurers to their lodgings. How might Siegfried, or any else against whom they plotted, ware himself against their wiles? This later brought great sorrow to them all. The king walked whispering with his friends; Hagen of Troneg never let him rest. Enow of the king’s liegemen would fain have parted the strife, but Hagen would not give up his plan. On a day Siegfried found them whispering. The hero of Netherland gan ask: “How go the king and his men so sadly? I’ll help avenge it, hath any done you aught.”
<br> 
<br> Then spake King Gunther: “I am rightly sad. Liudegast and Liudeger have challenged me to war; they are minded to ride openly into my land.”
<br> 
<br> At this the bold knight said: “Siegfried’s hand shall hinder that with zeal, as beseemeth all your honors. I’ll do yet to these knights as I did before; I’ll lay waste their lands, or ever I turn again. Be my head your pledge of this. Ye and your warriors shall stay at home and let me ride to meet them with those I have. I’ll let you see how fain I serve you. This know, through me it shall go evil with your foes.”
<br> 
<br> “Well is me of these tidings,” spake then the king, as though he were glad in earnest of this aid. With guile the faithless man bowed low.
<br> 
<br> Quoth Lord Siegfried: “Ye shall have small care.”
<br> 
<br> Then they made ready for the journey hence with the men-at-arms. This was done for Siegfried and his men to see. He, too, bade those of Netherland get them ready. Siegfried’s warriors sought out warlike weeds. Then the stalwart Siegfried spake: “My father Siegmund, ye must stay here. We shall return in short space hither to the Rhine, and God give us luck. Ye must here make merry with the king.”
<br> 
<br> They tied fast their banners, as though they would away, and there were enow of Gunther’s men who wist not wherefore this was done. Great rout of men was seen at Siegfried’s side. They bound their helmets and their breastplates upon the steeds, and many a stout knight made ready to quit the land. Then Hagen of Troneg went to find Kriemhild and asked for leave; sith they would void the land.
<br> 
<br> “Now well is me,” spake Kriemhild, “that I have won a husband who dare protect so well my loving kinsfolk, as my Lord Siegfried doth here. Therefore,” spake the queen, “will I be glad of heart. Dear friend Hagen, think on that, that I do serve you gladly and never yet did bear you hate. Requite this now to me in my dear husband. Let him not suffer, if I have done to Brunhild aught. I since have rued it,” spake the noble wife. “Moreover, he since hath beaten me black and blue; the brave hero and a good hath well avenged that ever I spake what grieved her heart.”
<br> 
<br> “Ye’ll be friends once more after some days. Kriemhild, dear lady, pray tell me how I may serve you in your husband Siegfried. Liefer will I do this for you than for any else.”
<br> 
<br> “I should be without all fear,” quoth the noble dame, “that any one would take his life in the fray, if he would not follow his overweening mood; then the bold knight and a good were safe.”
<br> 
<br> “Lady,” spake then Hagen, “an’ ye do think that men might wound him, pray let me know with what manner of arts I can prevent this. On foot, on horse, will I ever be his guard.”
<br> 
<br> She spake: “Thou art my kinsman and I am thine. I’ll commend to thee trustingly the dear lover of mine, that thou mayst guard him well, mine own dear husband.” She made him acquaint with tales which had been better left unsaid. She spake: “My husband is brave and strong enow. When he slew the dragon on the hill, the lusty warrior bathed him of a truth in the blood, so that since then no weapon ever cut him in the fray. Yet am I in fear, whenever he standeth in the fight and many javelins are cast by heroes’ hands, that I may lose this dear husband of mine. Alas, how oft I suffer sore for Siegfried’s sake! Dear kinsman, in the hope that thou wilt hold thy troth with me, I’ll tell thee where men may wound the dear lord of mine. I let thee hear this, ’tis done in faith. When the hot blood gushed from the dragon’s wounds and the bold hero and a good bathed him therein, a broad linden leaf did fall betwixt his shoulder blades. Therefore am I sore afraid that men may cut him there.”
<br> 
<br> Then spake Hagen of Troneg: “Sew a small mark upon his coat, whereby I may know where I must guard him, when we stand in battle.”
<br> 
<br> She weened to save her knight, but ’twas done unto his death. She spake: “With fine silk I’ll sew a secret cross upon his vesture. There, knight, thy hand must guard my husband, when the strife is on and he standeth in the battle before his foes.”
<br> 
<br> “That will I well, dear my lady,” Hagen then replied.
<br> 
<br> The lady weened that it would boot him aught, but Kriemhild’s husband was thereby betrayed. Hagen then took leave; merrily he hied him hence. The king’s liegeman was blithe of mood. I ween that nevermore will warrior give such false counsel, as was done by him when Kriemhild trusted in his troth.
<br> 
<br> Next morning Siegfried with a thousand of his men rode merrily forth. He weened he should avenge the grievance of his kinsmen. Hagen rode so near him that he could eye his clothes. When he saw the sign, he sent in secret twain of his men, who should tell another tale: that Gunther’s land should still have peace and that Liudeger had sent them to the king. How loth Siegfried now rode home again, or ever he had avenged his kinsmen’s wrongs! Gunther’s men could hardly turn him back. He rode then to the king; the host gan thank him. “Now God requite you of your will, friend Siegfried, that ye do so willingly what I bid you. For this I’ll ever serve you, as I rightly should. I trust you more than all my friends. Now that we be rid of this foray, I am minded to ride a-hunting for bears and boars to the Vosges forest, as I have done oft-time.” That Hagen, the faithless knight, had counseled. “Let it be told to all my guests, that we ride betimes. Those that would hunt with me must make them ready. If any choose to stay at home to court the ladies, that liketh me as well.”
<br> 
<br> Then spake Sir Siegfried in lordly wise: “And ye would a-hunting, I’d fain go with you. Pray lend me a huntsman and some brach, 76 and I will ride to the pines.”
<br> 
<br> “Will ye have but one?” spake the king anon. “I’ll lend you, an’ ye will, four men to whom both wood and paths be known where the game is wont to go, and who will not let you miss the camp.”
<br> 
<br> Then rode the full lusty warrior to his wife, whilst Hagen quickly told the king how he thought to trap the doughty knight. A man should never use such faithlessness.
