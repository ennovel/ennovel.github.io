Richardsaid he was ready for anything. When Mr. Jarndyce doubted whetherhe might not already be too old to enter the Navy, Richard said hehad thought of that, and perhaps he was. When Mr. Jarndyce askedhim what he thought of the Army, Richard said he had thought ofthat, too, and it wasn't a bad idea. When Mr. Jarndyce advised himto try and decide within himself whether his old preference for thesea was an ordinary boyish inclination or a strong impulse, Richardanswered, Well he really HAD tried very often, and he couldn't makeout.</p> 
<p>　　"How much of this indecision of character," Mr. Jarndyce said to me,"is chargeable on that incomprehensible heap of uncertainty andprocrastination on which he has been thrown from his birth, I don'tpretend to say; but that Chancery, among its other sins, isresponsible for some of it, I can plainly see. It has engendered orconfirmed in him a habit of putting off--and trusting to this, that,and the other chance, without knowing what chance--and dismissingeverything as unsettled, uncertain, and confused. The character ofmuch older and steadier people may be even changed by thecircumstances surrounding them. It would be too much to expect thata boy's, in its formation, should be the subject of such influencesand escape them."I felt this to be true; though if I may venture to mention what Ithought besides, I thought it much to be regretted that Richard'seducation had not counteracted those influences or directed hischaracter. He had been eight years at a public school and hadlearnt, I understood, to make Latin verses of several sorts in themost admirable manner. But I never heard that it had been anybody'sbusiness to find out what his natural bent was, or where hisfailings lay, or to adapt any kind of knowledge to HIM. HE had beenadapted to the verses and had learnt the art of making them to suchperfection that if he had remained at school until he was of age, Isuppose he could only have gone on making them over and over againunless he had enlarged his education by forgetting how to do it.</p> 
<p>　　Still, although I had no doubt that they were very beautiful, andvery improving, and very sufficient for a great many purposes oflife, and always remembered all through life, I did doubt whetherRichard would not have profited by some one studying him a little,instead of his studying them quite so much.</p> 
<p>　　To be sure, I knew nothing of the subject and do not even now knowwhether the young gentlemen of classic Rome or Greece made verses tothe same extent--or whether the young gentlemen of any country everdid.</p> 
<p>　　"I haven't the least idea," said Richard, musing, "what I had betterbe. Except that I am quite sure I don't want to go into the Church,it's a toss-up.""You have no inclination in Mr. Kenge's way?" suggested Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Jarndyce.</p> 
<p>　　"I don't know that, sir!" replied Richard. "I am fond of boating.</p> 
<p>　　Articled clerks go a good deal on the water. It's a capitalprofession!""Surgeon--" suggested Mr. Jarndyce.</p> 
<p>　　"That's the thing, sir!" cried Richard.</p> 
<p>　　I doubt if he had ever once thought of it before.</p> 
<p>　　"That's the thing, sir," repeated Richard with the greatestenthusiasm. "We have got it at last. M.R.C.S.!"He was not to be laughed out of it, though he laughed at itheartily. He said he had chosen his profession, and the more hethought of it, the more he felt that his destiny was clear; the artof healing was the art of all others for him. Mistrusting that heonly came to this conclusion because, having never had much chanceof finding out for himself what he was fitted for and having neverbeen guided to the discovery, he was taken by the newest idea andwas glad to get rid of the trouble of consideration, I wonderedwhether the Latin verses often ended in this or whether Richard'swas a solitary case.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Jarndyce took great pains to talk with him seriously and to putit to his good sense not to deceive himself in so important amatter. Richard was a little grave after these interviews, butinvariably told Ada and me that it was all right, and then began totalk about something else.</p> 
<p>　　"By heaven!" cried Mr. Boythorn, who interested himself strongly inthe subject--though I need not say that, for he could do nothingweakly; "I rejoice to find a young gentleman of spirit and gallantrydevoting himself to that noble profession! The more spirit there isin it, the better for mankind and the worse for those mercenarytask-masters and low tricksters who delight in putting thatillustrious art at a disadvantage in the world. By all that is baseand despicable," cried Mr. Boythorn, "the treatment of surgeonsaboard ship is such that I would submit the legs--both legs--ofevery member of the Admiralty Board to a compound fracture andrender it a transportable offence in any qualified practitioner toset them if the system were not wholly changed in eight and fortyhours!""Wouldn't you give them a week?" asked Mr. Jarndyce.</p> 
<p>　　"No!" cried Mr. Boythorn firmly. "Not on any consideration! Eightand forty hours! As to corporations, parishes, vestry-boards, andsimilar gatherings of jolter-headed clods who assemble to exchangesuch speeches that, by heaven, they ought to be worked inquicksilver mines for the short remainder of their miserableexistence, if it were only to prevent their detestable English fromcontaminating a language spoken in the presence of the sun--as tothose fellows, who meanly take advantage of the ardour of gentlemenin the pursuit of knowledge to recompense the inestimable servicesof the best years of their lives, their long study, and theirexpensive education with pittances too small for the acceptance ofclerks, I would have the necks of every one of them wrung and theirskulls arranged in Surgeons' Hall for the contemplation of the wholeprofession in order that its younger members might understand fromactual measurement, in early life, HOW thick skulls may become!"He wound up this vehement declaration by looking round upon us witha most agreeable smile and suddenly thundering, "Ha, ha, ha!" overand over again, until anybody else might have been expected to bequite subdued by the exertion.</p> 
<p>　　As Richard still continued to say that he was fixed in his choiceafter repeated periods for consideration had been recommended by Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Jarndyce and had expired, and he still continued to assure Ada andme in the same final manner that it was "all right," it becameadvisable to take Mr. Kenge into council. Mr. Kenge, therefore,came down to dinner one day, and leaned back in his chair, andturned his eye-glasses over and over, and spoke in a sonorous voice,and did exactly what I remembered to have seen him do when I was alittle girl.</p> 
<p>　　"Ah!" said Mr. Kenge. "Yes. Well! A very good profession, Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Jarndyce, a very good profession.""The course of study and preparation requires to be diligentlypursued," observed my guardian with a glance at Richard.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, no doubt," said Mr. Kenge. "Diligently.""But that being the case, more or less, with all pursuits that areworth much," said Mr. Jarndyce, "it is not a special considerationwhich another choice would be likely to escape.""Truly," said Mr. Kenge. "And Mr. Richard Carstone, who has someritoriously acquitted himself in the--shall I say the classicshades?--in which his youth had been passed, will, no doubt, applythe habits, if not the principles and practice, of versification inthat tongue in which a poet was said (unless I mistake) to be born,not made, to the more eminently practical field of action on whichhe enters.""You may rely upon it," said Richard in his off-hand manner, "that Ishall go at it and do my best.""Very well, Mr. Jarndyce!" said Mr. Kenge, gently nodding his head.</p> 
<p>　　"Really, when we are assured by Mr. Richard that he means to go atit and to do his best," nodding feelingly and smoothly over thoseexpressions, "I would submit to you that we have only to inquireinto the best mode of carrying out the object of his ambition. Now,with reference to placing Mr. Richard with some sufficiently eminentpractitioner. Is there any one in view at present?""No one, Rick, I think?" said my guardian.</p> 
<p>　　"No one, sir," said Richard.</p> 
<p>　　"Quite so!" observed Mr. Kenge. "As to situation, now. Is thereany particular feeling on that head?""N--no," said Richard.</p> 
<p>　　"Quite so!" observed Mr. Kenge again.</p> 
<p>　　"I should like a little variety," said Richard; "I mean a good rangeof experience.""Very requisite, no doubt," returned Mr. Kenge. "I think this maybe easily arranged, Mr. Jarndyce? We have only, in the first place,to discover a sufficiently eligible practitioner; and as soon as wemake our want--and shall I add, our ability to pay a premium?--known, our only difficulty will be in the selection of one from alarge number. We have only, in the second place, to observe thoselittle formalities which are rendered necessary by our time of lifeand our being under the guardianship of the court. We shall soonbe--shall I say, in Mr. Richard's own light-hearted manner, 'goingat it'--to our heart's content. It is a coincidence," said Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Kenge with a tinge of melancholy in his smile, "one of thosecoincidences which may or may not require an explanation beyond ourpresent limited faculties, that I have a cousin in the medicalprofession. He might be deemed eligible by you and might bedisposed to respond to this proposal. I can answer for him aslittle as for you, but he MIGHT!"As this was an opening in the prospect, it was arranged that Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Kenge should see his cousin. And as Mr. Jarndyce had beforeproposed to take us to London for a few weeks, it was settled nextday that we should make our visit at once and combine Richard'sbusiness with it.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Boythorn leaving us within a week, we took up our abode at acheerful lodging near Oxford Street over an upholsterer's shop.</p> 
<p>　　London was a great wonder to us, and we were out for hours and hoursat a time, seeing the sights, which appeared to be less capable ofexhaustion than we were. We made the round of the principaltheatres, too, with great delight, and saw all the plays that wereworth seeing. I mention this because it was at the theatre that Ibegan to be made uncomfortable again by Mr. Guppy.</p> 
<p>　　I was sitting in front of the box one night with Ada, and Richardwas in the place he liked best, behind Ada's chair, when, happeningto look down into the pit, I saw Mr. Guppy, with his hair flatteneddown upon his head and woe depicted in his face, looking up at me.</p> 
<p>　　I felt all through the performance that he never looked at theactors but constantly looked at me, and always with a carefullyprepared expression of the deepest misery and the profoundestdejection.</p> 
<p>　　It quite spoiled my pleasure for that night because it was so veryembarrassing and so very ridiculous. But from that time forth, wenever went to the play without my seeing Mr. Guppy in the pit,always with his hair straight and flat, his shirt-collar turneddown, and a general feebleness about him. If he were not there whenwe went in, and I began to hope he would not come and yielded myselffor a little while to the interest of the scene, I was certain toencounter his languishing eyes when I least expected it and, fromthat time, to be quite sure that they were fixed upon me all theevening.</p> 
<p>　　I really cannot express how uneasy this made me. If he would onlyhave brushed up his hair or turned up his collar, it would have beenbad enough; but to know that that absurd figure was always gazing atme, and always in that demonstrative state of despondency, put sucha constraint upon me that I did not like to laugh at the play, or tocry at it, or to move, or to speak. I seemed able to do nothingnaturally. As to escaping Mr. Guppy by going to the back of thebox, I could not bear to do that because I knew Richard and Adarelied on having me next them and that they could never have talkedtogether so happily if anybody else had been in my place. So thereI sat, not knowing where to look--for wherever I looked, I knew Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Guppy's eyes were following me--and thinking of the dreadful expenseto which this young man was putting himself on my account.</p> 
<p>　　Sometimes I thought of telling Mr. Jarndyce. Then I feared that theyoung man would lose his situation and that I might ruin him.</p> 
<p>　　Sometimes I thought of confiding in Richard, but was deterred by thepossibility of his fighting Mr. Guppy and giving him black eyes.</p> 
<p>　　Sometimes I thought, should I frown at him or shake my head. Then Ifelt I could not do it. Sometimes I considered whether I shouldwrite to his mother, but that ended in my being convinced that toopen a correspondence would he to make the matter worse. I alwayscame to the conclusion, finally, that I could do nothing. Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Guppy's perseverance, all this time, not only produced him regularlyat any theatre to which we went, but caused him to appear in thecrowd as we were coming out, and even to get up behind our fly--where I am sure I saw him, two or three times, struggling among themost dreadful spikes. After we got home, he haunted a post oppositeour house. The upholsterer's where we lodged being at the corner oftwo streets, and my bedroom window being opposite the post, I wasafraid to go near the window when I went upstairs, lest I should seehim (as I did one moonlight night) leaning against the post andevidenfly catching cold. If Mr. Guppy had not been, fortunately forme, engaged in the daytime, I really should have had no rest fromhim.</p> 
<p>　　While we were making this round of gaieties, in which Mr. Guppy soextraordinarily participated, the business which had helped to bringus to town was not neglected. Mr. Kenge's cousin was a Mr. BayhamBadger, who had a good practice at Chelsea and attended a largepublic institution besides. He was quite willing to receive Richardinto his house and to superintend his studies, and as it seemed thatthose could be pursued advantageously under Mr. Badger's roof, andMr. Badger liked Richard, and as Richard said he liked Mr. Badger"well enough," an agreement was made, the Lord Chancellor's consentwas obtained, and it was all settled.</p> 
<p>　　On the day when matters were concluded between Richard and Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Badger, we were all under engagement to dine at Mr. Badger's house.</p> 
<p>　　We were to be "merely a family party," Mrs. Badger's note said; andwe found no lady there but Mrs. Badger herself. She was surroundedin the drawing-room by various objects, indicative of her painting alittle, playing the piano a little, playing the guitar a little,playing the harp a little, singing a little, working a little,reading a little, writing poetry a little, and botanizing a little.</p> 
<p>　　She was a lady of about fifty, I should think, youthfully dressed,and of a very fine complexion. If I add to the little list of heraccomplishments that she rouged a little, I do not mean that therewas any harm in it.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Bayham Badger himself was a pink, fresh-faced, crisp-lookinggentleman with a weak voice, white teeth, light hair, and surprisedeyes, some years younger, I should say, than Mrs. Bayham Badger. Headmired her exceedingly, but principally, and to begin with, on thecurious ground (as it seemed to us) of her having had threehusbands. We had barely taken our seats when he said to Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Jarndyce quite triumphantly, "You would hardly suppose that I amMrs. Bayham Badger's third!""Indeed?" said Mr. Jarndyce.</p> 
<p>　　"Her third!" said Mr. Badger. "Mrs. Bayham Badger has not theappearance, Miss Summerson, of a lady who has had two formerhusbands?"I said "Not at all!""And most remarkable men!" said Mr. Badger in a tone of confidence.</p> 
<p>　　"Captain Swosser of the Royal Navy, who was Mrs. Badger's firsthusband, was a very distinguished officer indeed. The name ofProfessor Dingo, my immediate predecessor, is one of Europeanreputation."Mrs. Badger overheard him and smiled.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes, my dear!" Mr. Badger replied to the smile, "I was observing toMr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson that you had had two formerhusbands--both very distinguished men. And they found it, as peoplegenerally do, difficult to believe.""I was barely twenty," said Mrs. Badger, "when I married CaptainSwosser of the Royal Navy. I was in the Mediterranean with him; Iam quite a sailor. On the twelfth anniversary of my wedding-day, Ibecame the wife of Professor Dingo.""Of European reputation," added Mr. Badger in an undertone.</p> 
<p>　　"And when Mr. Badger and myself were married," pursued Mrs. Badger,"we were married on the same day of the year. I had become attachedto the day.""So that Mrs. Badger has been married to three husbands--two of themhighly distinguished men," said Mr. Badger, summing up the facts,"and each time upon the twenty-first of March at eleven in theforenoon!"We all expressed our admiration.</p> 
<p>　　"But for Mr. Badger's modesty," said Mr. Jarndyce, "I would takeleave to correct him and say three distinguished men.""Thank you, Mr. Jarndyce! What I always tell him!" observed Mrs.</p> 
<p>　　Badger.</p> 
<p>　　"And, my dear," said Mr. Badger, "what do I always tell you? Thatwithout any affectation of disparaging such professional distinctionas I may have attained (which our friend Mr. Carstone will have manyopportunities of estimating), I am not so weak--no, really," saidMr. Badger to us generally, "so unreasonable--as to put myreputation on the same footing with such first-rate men as CaptainSwosser and Professor Dingo. Perhaps you may be interested, Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Jarndyce," continued Mr. Bayham Badger, leading the way into thenext drawing-room, "in this portrait of Captain Swosser. It wastaken on his return home from the African station, where he hadsuffered from the fever of the country. Mrs. Badger considers ittoo yellow. But it's a very fine head. A very fine head!"We all echoed, "A very fine head!""I feel when I look at it," said Mr. Badger, "'That's a man I shouldlike to have seen!' It strikingly bespeaks the first-class man thatCaptain Swosser pre-eminently was. On the other side, ProfessorDingo. I knew him well--attended him in his last illness--aspeaking likeness! Over the piano, Mrs. Bayham Badger when Mrs.</p> 
<p>　　Swosser. Over the sofa, Mrs. Bayham Badger when Mrs. Dingo. OfMrs. Bayham Badger IN ESSE, I possess the original and have nocopy."Dinner was now announced, and we went downstairs. It was a verygenteel entertainment, very handsomely served. But the captain andthe professor still ran in Mr. Badger's head, and as Ada and I hadthe honour of being under his particular care, we had the fullbenefit of them.</p> 
<p>　　"Water, Miss Summerson? Allow me! Not in that tumbler, pray.</p> 
<p>　　Bring me the professor's goblet, James!"Ada very much admired some artificial flowers under a glass.</p> 
<p>　　"Astonishing how they keep!" said Mr. Badger. "They were presentedto Mrs. Bayham Badger when she was in the Mediterranean."He invited Mr. Jarndyce to take a glass of claret.</p> 
<p>　　"Not that claret!" he said. "Excuse me! This is an occasion, andON an occasion I produce some very special claret I happen to have.</p> 
<p>　　(James, Captain Swosser's wine!) Mr. Jarndyce, this is a wine thatwas imported by the captain, we will not say how many years ago.</p> 
<p>　　You will find it very curious. My dear, I shall he happy to takesome of this wine with you. (Captain Swosser's claret to yourmistress, James!) My love, your health!"After dinner, when we ladies retired, we took Mrs. Badger's firstand second husband with us. Mrs. Badger gave us in the drawing-rooma biographical sketch of the life and services of Captain Swosserbefore his marriage and a more minute account of him dating from thetime when he fell in love with her at a ball on board the Crippler,given to the officers of that ship when she lay in Plymouth Harbour.</p> 
<p>　　"The dear old Crippler!" said Mrs. Badger, shaking her head. "Shewas a noble vessel. Trim, ship-shape, all a taunto, as CaptainSwosser used to say. You must excuse me if I occasionally introducea nautical expression; I was quite a sailor once. Captain Swosserloved that craft for my sake. When she was no longer in commission,he frequently said that if he were rich enough to buy her old hulk,he would have an inscription let into the timbers of the quarter-deck where we stood as partners in the dance to mark the spot wherehe fell--raked fore and aft (Captain Swosser used to say) by thefire from my tops. It was his naval way of mentioning my eyes."Mrs. Badger shook her head, sighed, and looked in the glass.</p> 
<p>　　"It was a great change from Captain Swosser to Professor Dingo," sheresumed with a plaintive smile. "I felt it a good deal at first.</p> 
<p>　　Such an entire revolution in my mode of life! But custom, combinedwith science--particularly science--inured me to it. Being theprofessor's sole companion in his botanical excursions, I almostforgot that I had ever been afloat, and became quite learned. It issingular that the professor was the antipodes of Captain Swosser andthat Mr. Badger is not in the least like either!"We then passed into a narrative of the deaths of Captain Swosser andProfessor Dingo, both of whom seem to have had very bad complaints.</p> 
<p>　　In the course of it, Mrs. Badger signified to us that she had nevermadly loved but once and that the object of that wild affection,never to be recalled in its fresh enthusiasm, was Captain Swosser.</p> 
<p>　　The professor was yet dying by inches in the most dismal manner, andMrs. Badger was giving us imitations of his way of saying, withgreat difficulty, "Where is Laura? Let Laura give me my toast andwater!" when the entrance of the gentlemen consigned him to thetomb.</p> 
<p>　　Now, I observed that evening, as I had observed for some days past,that Ada and Richard were more than ever attached to each other'ssociety, which was but natural, seeing that they were going to beseparated so soon. I was therefore not very much surprised when wegot home, and Ada and I retired upstairs, to find Ada more silentthan usual, though I was not quite prepared for her coming into myarms and beginning to speak to me, with her face hidden.</p> 
<p>　　"My darling Esther!" murmured Ada. "I have a great secret to tellyou!"A mighty secret, my pretty one, no doubt!</p> 
<p>　　"What is it, Ada?""Oh, Esther, you would never guess!""Shall I try to guess?" said I.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, no! Don't! Pray don't!" cried Ada, very much startled by theidea of my doing so.</p> 
<p>　　"Now, I wonder who it can be about?" said I, pretending to consider.</p> 
<p>　　"It's about--" said Ada in a whisper. "It's about--my cousinRichard!""Well, my own!" said I, kissing her bright hair, which was all Icould see. "And what about him?""Oh, Esther, you would never guess!"It was so pretty to have her clinging to me in that way, hiding herface, and to know that she was not crying in sorrow but in a littleglow of joy, and pride, and hope, that I would not help her justyet.</p> 
<p>　　"He says--I know it's very foolish, we are both so young--but hesays," with a burst of tears, "that he loves me dearly, Esther.""Does he indeed?" said I. "I never heard of such a thing! Why, mypet of pets, I could have told you that weeks and weeks ago!"To see Ada lift up her flushed face in joyful surprise, and hold meround the neck, and laugh, and cry, and blush, was so pleasant!</p> 
<p>　　"Why, my darling," said I, "what a goose you must take me for! Yourcousin Richard has been loving you as plainly as he could for Idon't know how long!""And yet you never said a word about it!" cried Ada, kissing me.</p> 
<p>　　"No, my love," said I. "I waited to be told.""But now I have told you, you don't think it wrong of me, do you?"returned Ada. She might have coaxed me to say no if I had been thehardest-hearted duenna in the world. Not being that yet, I said novery freely.</p> 
<p>　　"And now," said I, "I know the worst of it.""Oh, that's not quite the worst of it, Esther dear!" cried Ada,holding me tighter and laying down her face again upon my breast.</p> 
<p>　　"No?" said I. "Not even that?""No, not even that!" said Ada, shaking her head.</p> 
<p>　　"Why, you never mean to say--" I was beginning in joke.</p> 
<p>　　But Ada, looking up and smiling through her tear's, cried, "Yes, Ido! You know, you know I do!" And then sobbed out, "With all myheart I do! With all my whole heart, Esther!"I told her, laughing, why I had known that, too, just as well as Ihad known the other! And we sat before the fire, and I had all thetalking to myself for a little while (though there was not much ofit); and Ada was soon quiet and happy.</p> 
<p>　　"Do you think my cousin John knows, dear Dame Durden?" she asked.</p> 
<p>　　"Unless my cousin John is blind, my pet," said I, "I should think mycousin John knows pretty well as much as we know.""We want to speak to him before Richard goes," said Ada timidly,"and we wanted you to advise us, and to tell him so. Perhaps youwouldn't mind Richard's coming in, Dame Durden?""Oh! Richard is outside, is he, my dear?" said I.</p> 
<p>　　"I am not quite certain," returned Ada with a bashful simplicitythat would have won my heart if she had not won it long before, "butI think he's waiting at the door."There he was, of course. They brought a chair on either side of me,and put me between them, and really seemed to have fallen in lovewith me instead of one another, they were so confiding, and sotrustful, and so fond of me. They went on in their own wild way fora little while--I never stopped them; I enjoyed it too much myself--and then we gradually fell to considering how young they were, andhow there must be a lapse of several years before this early lovecould come to anything, and how it could come to happiness only ifit were real and lasting and inspired them with a steady resolutionto do their duty to each other, with constancy, fortitude, andperseverance, each always for the other's sake. Well! Richard saidthat he would work his fingers to the bone for Ada, and Ada saidthat she would work her fingers to the bone for Richard, and theycalled me all sorts of endearing and sensible names, and we satthere, advising and talking, half the night. Finally, before weparted, I gave them my promise to speak to their cousin John to-morrow.</p> 
<p>　　So, when to-morrow came, I went to my guardian after breakfast, inthe room that was our town-substitute for the growlery, and told himthat I had it in trust to tell him something.</p> 
<p>　　"Well, little woman," said he, shutting up his book, "if you haveaccepted the trust, there can be no harm in it.""I hope not, guardian," said I. "I can guarantee that there is nosecrecy in it. For it only happened yesterday.""Aye? And what is it, Esther?""Guardian," said I, "you remember the happy night when first we camedown to Bleak House? When Ada was singing in the dark room?"I wished to call to his remembrance the look he had given me then.</p> 
<p>　　Unless I am much mistaken, I saw that I did so.</p> 
<p>　　"Because--" said I with a little hesitation.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes, my dear!" said he. "Don't hurry.""Because," said I, "Ada and Richard have fallen in love. And havetold each other so.""Already!" cried my guardian, quite astonished.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes!" said I. "And to tell you the truth, guardian, I ratherexpected it.""The deuce you did!" said he.</p> 
<p>　　He sat considering for a minute or two, with his smile, at once sohandsome and so kind, upon his changing face, and then requested meto let them know that he wished to see them. When they came, heencircled Ada with one arm in his fatherly way and addressed himselfto Richard with a cheerful gravity.</p> 
<p>　　"Rick," said Mr. Jarndyce, "I am glad to have won your confidence.</p> 
<p>　　I hope to preserve it. When I contemplated these relations betweenus four which have so brightened my life and so invested it with newinterests and pleasures, I certainly did contemplate, afar off, thepossibility of you and your pretty cousin here (don't be shy, Ada,don't be shy, my dear!) being in a mind to go through life together.</p> 
<p>　　I saw, and do see, many reasons to make it desirable. But that wasafar off, Rick, afar off!""We look afar off, sir," returned Richard.</p> 
<p>　　"Well!" said Mr. Jarndyce. "That's rational. Now, hear me, mydears! I might tell you that you don't know your own minds yet,that a thousand things may happen to divert you from one another,that it is well this chain of flowers you have taken up is veryeasily broken, or it might become a chain of lead. But I will notdo that. Such wisdom will come soon enough, I dare say, if it is tocome at all. I will assume that a few years hence you will be inyour hearts to one another what you are to-day. All I say beforespeaking to you according to that assumption is, if you DO change--if you DO come to find that you are more commonplace cousins to eachother as man and woman than you were as boy and girl (your manhoodwill excuse me, Rick!)--don't be ashamed still to confide in me, forthere will be nothing monstrous or uncommon in it. I am only yourfriend and distant kinsman. I have no power over you whatever. ButI wish and hope to retain your confidence if I do nothing to forfeitit.""I am very sure, sir," returned Richard, "that I speak for Ada toowhen I say that you have the strongest power over us both--rooted inrespect, gratitude, and affection--strengthening every day.""Dear cousin John," said Ada, on his shoulder, "my father's placecan never be empty again. All the love and duty I could ever haverendered to him is transferred to you.""Come!" said Mr. Jarndyce. "Now for our assumption. Now we liftour eyes up and look hopefully at the distance! Rick, the world isbefore you; and it is most probable that as you enter it, so it willreceive you. Trust in nothing but in Providence and your ownefforts. Never separate the two, like the heathen waggoner.</p> 
<p>　　Constancy in love is a good thing, but it means nothing, and isnothing, without constancy in every kind of effort. If you had theabilities of all the great men, past and present, you could donothing well without sincerely meaning it and setting about it. Ifyou entertain the supposition that any real success, in great thingsor in small, ever was or could be, ever will or can be, wrested fromFortune by fits and starts, leave that wrong idea here or leave yourcousin Ada here.""I will leave IT here, sir," replied Richard smiling, "if I broughtit here just now (but I hope I did not), and will work my way on tomy cousin Ada in the hopeful distance.""Right!" said Mr. Jarndyce. "If you are not to make her happy, whyshould you pursue her?""I wouldn't make her unhappy--no, not even for her love," retortedRichard proudly.</p> 
<p>　　"Well said!" cried Mr. Jarndyce. "That's well said! She remainshere, in her home with me. Love her, Rick, in your active life, noless than in her home when you revisit it, and all will go well.</p> 
<p>　　Otherwise, all will go ill. That's the end of my preaching. Ithink you and Ada had better take a walk."Ada tenderly embraced him, and Richard heartily shook hands withhim, and then the cousins went out of the room, looking back againdirectly, though, to say that they would wait for me.</p> 
<p>　　The door stood open, and we both followed them with our eyes asthey passed down the adjoining room, on which the sun was shining,and out at its farther end. Richard with his head bent, and herhand drawn through his arm, was talking to her very earnestly; andshe looked up in his face, listening, and seemed to see nothingelse. So young, so beautiful, so full of hope and promise, theywent on lightly through the sunlight as their own happy thoughtsmight then be traversing the years to come and making them allyears of brightness. So they passed away into the shadow and weregone. It was only a burst of light that had been so radiant. Theroom darkened as they went out, and the sun was clouded over.</p> 
<p>　　"Am I right, Esther?" said my guardian when they were gone.</p> 
<p>　　He was so good and wise to ask ME whether he was right!</p> 
<p>　　"Rick may gain, out of this, the quality he wants. Wants, at thecore of so much that is good!" said Mr. Jarndyce, shaking his head.</p> 
<p>　　"I have said nothing to Ada, Esther. She has her friend andcounsellor always near." And he laid his hand lovingly upon myhead.</p> 
<p>　　I could not help showing that I was a little moved, though I didall I could to conceal it.</p> 
<p>　　"Tut tut!" said he. "But we must take care, too, that our littlewoman's life is not all consumed in care for others.""Care? My dear guardian, I believe I am the happiest creature inthe world!""I believe so, too," said he. "But some one may find out whatEsther never will--that the little woman is to be held inremembrance above all other people!"I have omitted to mention in its place that there was some one elseat the family dinner party. It was not a lady. It was agentleman. It was a gentleman of a dark complexion--a youngsurgeon. He was rather reserved, but I thought him very sensibleand agreeable. At least, Ada asked me if I did not, and I saidyes.</p>
