We wereoften in the park and in the woods and seldom passed the lodgewhere we had taken shelter without looking in to speak to thekeeper's wife; but we saw no more of Lady Dedlock, except at churchon Sundays. There was company at Chesney Wold; and althoughseveral beautiful faces surrounded her, her face retained the sameinfluence on me as at first. I do not quite know even now whetherit was painful or pleasurable, whether it drew me towards her ormade me shrink from her. I think I admired her with a kind offear, and I know that in her presence my thoughts always wanderedback, as they had done at first, to that old time of my life.</p> 
<p>　　I had a fancy, on more than one of these Sundays, that what thislady so curiously was to me, I was to her--I mean that I disturbedher thoughts as she influenced mine, though in some different way.</p> 
<p>　　But when I stole a glance at her and saw her so composed anddistant and unapproachable, I felt this to be a foolish weakness.</p> 
<p>　　Indeed, I felt the whole state of my mind in reference to her to beweak and unreasonable, and I remonstrated with myself about it asmuch as I could.</p> 
<p>　　One incident that occurred before we quitted Mr. Boythorn's house,I had better mention in this place.</p> 
<p>　　I was walking in the garden with Ada and when I was told that someone wished to see me. Going into the breakfast-room where thisperson was waiting, I found it to be the French maid who had castoff her shoes and walked through the wet grass on the day when itthundered and lightened.</p> 
<p>　　"Mademoiselle," she began, looking fixedly at me with her too-eagereyes, though otherwise presenting an agreeable appearance andspeaking neither with boldness nor servility, "I have taken a greatliberty in coming here, but you know how to excuse it, being soamiable, mademoiselle.""No excuse is necessary," I returned, "if you wish to speak to me.""That is my desire, mademoiselle. A thousand thanks for thepermission. I have your leave to speak. Is it not?" she said in aquick, natural way.</p> 
<p>　　"Certainly," said I.</p> 
<p>　　"Mademoiselle, you are so amiable! Listen then, if you please. Ihave left my Lady. We could not agree. My Lady is so high, sovery high. Pardon! Mademoiselle, you are right!" Her quicknessanticipated what I might have said presently but as yet had onlythought. "It is not for me to come here to complain of my Lady.</p> 
<p>　　But I say she is so high, so very high. I will not say a wordmore. All the world knows that.""Go on, if you please," said I.</p> 
<p>　　"Assuredly; mademoiselle, I am thankful for your politeness.</p> 
<p>　　Mademoiselle, I have an inexpressible desire to find service with ayoung lady who is good, accomplished, beautiful. You are good,accomplished, and beautiful as an angel. Ah, could I have thehonour of being your domestic!""I am sorry--" I began.</p> 
<p>　　"Do not dismiss me so soon, mademoiselle!" she said with aninvoluntary contraction of her fine black eyebrows. "Let me hope amoment! Mademoiselle, I know this service would be more retiredthan that which I have quitted. Well! I wish that. I know thisservice would be less distinguished than that which I have quitted.</p> 
<p>　　Well! I wish that, I know that I should win less, as to wages here.</p> 
<p>　　Good. I am content.""I assure you," said I, quite embarrassed by the mere idea ofhaving such an attendant, "that I keep no maid--""Ah, mademoiselle, but why not? Why not, when you can have one sodevoted to you! Who would be enchanted to serve you; who would beso true, so zealous, and so faithful every day! Mademoiselle, Iwish with all my heart to serve you. Do not speak of money atpresent. Take me as I am. For nothing!"She was so singularly earnest that I drew back, almost afraid ofher. Without appearing to notice it, in her ardour she stillpressed herself upon me, speaking in a rapid subdued voice, thoughalways with a certain grace and propriety.</p> 
<p>　　"Mademoiselle, I come from the South country where we are quick andwhere we like and dislike very strong. My Lady was too high forme; I was too high for her. It is done--past--finlshed! Receiveme as your domestic, and I will serve you well. I will do more foryou than you figure to yourself now. Chut! Mademoiselle, I will--no matter, I will do my utmost possible in all things. If youaccept my service, you will not repent it. Mademoiselle, you willnot repent it, and I will serve you well. You don't know howwell!"There was a lowering energy in her face as she stood looking at mewhile I explained the impossibility of my engagmg her (withoutthinking it necessary to say how very little I desired to do so),which seemed to bring visibly before me some woman from the streetsof Paris in the reign of terror.</p> 
<p>　　She heard me out without interruption and then said with her prettyaccent and in her mildest voice, "Hey, mademoiselle, I havereceived my answer! I am sorry of it. But I must go elsewhere andseek what I have not found here. Will you graciously let me kissyour hand?"She looked at me more intently as she took it, and seemed to takenote, with her momentary touch, of every vein in it. "I fear Isurprised you, mademoiselle, on the day of the storm?" she saidwith a parting curtsy.</p> 
<p>　　I confessed that she had surprised us all.</p> 
<p>　　"I took an oath, mademoiselle," she said, smiling, "and I wanted tostamp it on my mind so that I might keep it faithfully. And Iwill! Adieu, mademoiselle!"So ended our conference, which I was very glad to bring to a close.</p> 
<p>　　I supposed she went away from the village, for I saw her no more;and nothing else occurred to disturb our tranquil summer pleasuresuntil six weeks were out and we returned home as I began just nowby saying.</p> 
<p>　　At that time, and for a good many weeks after that time, Richardwas constant in his visits. Besides coming every Saturday orSunday and remaining with us until Monday morning, he sometimesrode out on horseback unexpectedly and passed the evening with usand rode back again early next day. He was as vivacious as everand told us he was very industrious, but I was not easy in my mindabout him. It appeared to me that his industry was allmisdirected. I could not find that it led to anything but theformation of delusive hopes in connexion with the suit already thepernicious cause of so much sorrow and ruin. He had got at thecore of that mystery now, he told us, and nothing could be plainerthan that the will under which he and Ada were to take I don't knowhow many thousands of pounds must be finally established if therewere any sense or justice in the Court of Chancery--but oh, what agreat IF that sounded in my ears--and that this happy conclusioncould not be much longer delayed. He proved this to himself by allthe weary arguments on that side he had read, and every one of themsunk him deeper in the infatuation. He had even begun to haunt thecourt. He told us how he saw Miss Flite there daily, how theytalked together, and how he did her little kindnesses, and how,while he laughed at her, he pitied her from his heart. But henever thought--never, my poor, dear, sanguine Richard, capable ofso much happiness then, and with such better things before him--what a fatal link was riveting between his fresh youth and herfaded age, between his free hopes and her caged birds, and herhungry garret, and her wandering mind.</p> 
<p>　　Ada loved him too well to mistrust him much in anything he said ordid, and my guardian, though he frequently complained of the eastwind and read more than usual in the growlery, preserved a strictsilence on the subject. So I thought one day when I went to Londonto meet Caddy Jellyby, at her solicitation, I would ask Richard tobe in waiting for me at the coach-office, that we might have alittle talk together. I found him there when I arrived, and wewalked away arm in arm.</p> 
<p>　　"Well, Richard," said I as soon as I could begin to be grave withhim, "are you beginning to feel more settled now?""Oh, yes, my dear!" returned Richard. "I'm all right enough.""But settled?" said I.</p> 
<p>　　"How do you mean, settled?" returned Richard with his gay laugh.</p> 
<p>　　"Settled in the law," said I.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, aye," replied Richard, "I'm all right enough.""You said that before, my dear Richard.""And you don't think it's an answer, eh? Well! Perhaps it's not.</p> 
<p>　　Settled? You mean, do I feel as if I were settling down?""Yes.""Why, no, I can't say I am settling down," said Richard, stronglyemphasizing "down," as if that expressed the difficulty, "becauseone can't settle down while this business remains in such anunsettled state. When I say this business, of course I mean the--forbidden subject.""Do you think it will ever be in a settled state?" said I.</p> 
<p>　　"Not the least doubt of it," answered Richard.</p> 
<p>　　We walked a little way without speaking, and presently Richardaddressed me in his frankest and most feeling manner, thus: "Mydear Esther, I understand you, and I wish to heaven I were a moreconstant sort of fellow. I don't mean constant to Ada, for I loveher dearly--better and better every day--but constant to myself.</p> 
<p>　　(Somehow, I mean something that I can't very well express, butyou'll make it out.) If I were a more constant sort of fellow, Ishould have held on either to Badger or to Kenge and Carboy likegrim death, and should have begun to be steady and systematic bythis time, and shouldn't be in debt, and--""ARE you in debt, Richard?""Yes," said Richard, "I am a little so, my dear. Also, I havetaken rather too much to billiards and that sort of thing. Now themurder's out; you despise me, Esther, don't you?""You know I don't," said I.</p> 
<p>　　"You are kinder to me than I often am to myself," he returned. "Mydear Esther, I am a very unfortunate dog not to be more settled,but how CAN I be more settled? If you lived in an unfinishedhouse, you couldn't settle down in it; if you were condemned toleave everything you undertook unfinished, you would find it hardto apply yourself to anything; and yet that's my unhappy case. Iwas born into this unfinished contention with all its chances andchanges, and it began to unsettle me before I quite knew thedifference between a suit at law and a suit of clothes; and it hasgone on unsettling me ever since; and here I am now, conscioussometimes that I am but a worthless fellow to love my confidingcousin Ada."We were in a solitary place, and he put his hands before his eyesand sobbed as he said the words.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, Richard!" said I. "Do not be so moved. You have a noblenature, and Ada's love may make you worthier every day.""I know, my dear," he replied, pressing my arm, "I know all that.</p> 
<p>　　You mustn't mind my being a little soft now, for I have had allthis upon my mind for a long time, and have often meant to speak toyou, and have sometimes wanted opportunity and sometimes courage.</p> 
<p>　　I know what the thought of Ada ought to do for me, but it doesn'tdo it. I am too unsettled even for that. I love her mostdevotedly, and yet I do her wrong, in doing myself wrong, every dayand hour. But it can't last for ever. We shall come on for afinal hearing and get judgment in our favour, and then you and Adashall see what I can really be!"It had given me a pang to hear him sob and see the tears start outbetween his fingers, but that was infinitely less affecting to methan the hopeful animation with which he said these words.</p> 
<p>　　"I have looked well into the papers, Esther. I have been deep inthem for months," he continued, recovering his cheerfulness in amoment, "and you may rely upon it that we shall come outtriumphant. As to years of delay, there has been no want of them,heaven knows! And there is the greater probability of our bringingthe matter to a speedy close; in fact, it's on the paper now. Itwill be all right at last, and then you shall see!"Recalling how he had just now placed Messrs. Kenge and Carboy inthe same category with Mr. Badger, I asked him when he intended tobe articled in Lincoln's Inn.</p> 
<p>　　"There again! I think not at all, Esther," he returned with aneffort. "I fancy I have had enough of it. Having worked atJarndyce and Jarndyce like a galley slave, I have slaked my thirstfor the law and satisfied myself that I shouldn't like it.</p> 
<p>　　Besides, I find it unsettles me more and more to be so constantlyupon the scene of action. So what," continued Richard, confidentagain by this time, "do I naturally turn my thoughts to?""I can't imagine," said I.</p> 
<p>　　"Don't look so serious," returned Richard, "because it's the bestthing I can do, my dear Esther, I am certain. It's not as if Iwanted a profession for life. These proceedings will come to atermination, and then I am provided for. No. I look upon it as apursuit which is in its nature more or less unsettled, andtherefore suited to my temporary condition--I may say, preciselysuited. What is it that I naturally turn my thoughts to?"I looked at him and shook my head.</p> 
<p>　　"What," said Richard, in a tone of perfect conviction, "but thearmy!""The army?" said I.</p> 
<p>　　"The army, of course. What I have to do is to get a commission;and--there I am, you know!" said Richard.</p> 
<p>　　And then he showed me, proved by elaborate calculations in hispocket-book, that supposing he had contracted, say, two hundredpounds of debt in six months out of the army; and that hecontracted no debt at all within a corresponding period in thearmy--as to which he had quite made up his mind; this step mustinvolve a saving of four hundred pounds in a year, or two thousandpounds in five years, which was a considerable sum. And then hespoke so ingenuously and sincerely of the sacrifice he made inwithdrawing himself for a time from Ada, and of the earnestnesswith which he aspired--as in thought he always did, I know fullwell--to repay her love, and to ensure her happiness, and toconquer what was amiss in himself, and to acquire the very soul ofdecision, that he made my heart ache keenly, sorely. For, Ithought, how would this end, how could this end, when so soon andso surely all his manly qualities were touched by the fatal blightthat ruined everything it rested on!</p> 
<p>　　I spoke to Richard with all the earnestness I felt, and all thehope I could not quite feel then, and implored him for Ada's sakenot to put any trust in Chancery. To all I said, Richard readilyassented, riding over the court and everything else in his easy wayand drawing the brightest pictures of the character he was tosettle into--alas, when the grievous suit should loose its holdupon him! We had a long talk, but it always came back to that, insubstance.</p> 
<p>　　At last we came to Soho Square, where Caddy Jellyby had appointedto wait for me, as a quiet place in the neighbourhood of NewmanStreet. Caddy was in the garden in the centre and hurried out assoon as I appeared. After a few cheerful words, Richard left ustogether.</p> 
<p>　　"Prince has a pupil over the way, Esther," said Caddy, "and got thekey for us. So if you will walk round and round here with me, wecan lock ourselves in and I can tell you comfortably what I wantedto see your dear good face about.""Very well, my dear," said I. "Nothing could be better." SoCaddy, after affectionately squeezing the dear good face as shecalled it, locked the gate, and took my arm, and we began to walkround the garden very cosily.</p> 
<p>　　"You see, Esther," said Caddy, who thoroughly enjoyed a littleconfidence, "after you spoke to me about its being wrong to marrywithout Ma's knowledge, or even to keep Ma long in the darkrespecting our engagement--though I don't believe Ma cares much forme, I must say--I thought it right to mention your opinions toPrince. In the first place because I want to profit by everythingyou tell me, and in the second place because I have no secrets fromPrince.""I hope he approved, Caddy?""Oh, my dear! I assure you he would approve of anything you couldsay. You have no idea what an opimon he has of you!""Indeed!""Esther, it's enough to make anybody but me jealous," said Caddy,laughing and shaking her head; "but it only makes me joyful, foryou are the first friend I ever had, and the best friend I ever canhave, and nobody can respect and love you too much to please me.""Upon my word, Caddy," said I, "you are in the general conspiracyto keep me in a good humour. Well, my dear?""Well! I am going to tell you," replied Caddy, crossing her handsconfidentially upon my arm. "So we talked a good deal about it,and so I said to Prince, 'Prince, as Miss Summerson--""I hope you didn't say 'Miss Summerson'?""No. I didn't!" cried Caddy, greatly pleased and with thebrightest of faces. "I said, 'Esther.' I said to Prince, 'AsEsther is decidedly of that opinion, Prince, and has expressed itto me, and always hints it when she writes those kind notes, whichyou are so fond of hearing me read to you, I am prepared todisclose the truth to Ma whenever you think proper. And I think,Prince,' said I, 'that Esther thinks that I should be in a better,and truer, and more honourable position altogether if you did thesame to your papa.'""Yes, my dear," said I. "Esther certainly does think so.""So I was right, you see!" exclaimed Caddy. "Well! This troubledPrince a good deal, not because he had the least doubt about it,but because he is so considerate of the feelings of old Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Turveydrop; and he had his apprehensions that old Mr. Turveydropmight break his heart, or faint away, or be very much overcome insome affecting manner or other if he made such an announcement. Hefeared old Mr. Turveydrop might consider it undutiful and mightreceive too great a shock. For old Mr. Turveydrop's deportment isvery beautiful, you know, Esther," said Caddy, "and his feelingsare extremely sensitive.""Are they, my dear?""Oh, extremely sensitive. Prince says so. Now, this has caused mydarling child--I didn't mean to use the expression to you, Esther,"Caddy apologized, her face suffused with blushes, "but I generallycall Prince my darling child."I laughed; and Caddy laughed and blushed, and went on'</p> 
<p>　　"This has caused him, Esther--""Caused whom, my dear?""Oh, you tiresome thing!" said Caddy, laughing, with her prettyface on fire. "My darling child, if you insist upon it! This hascaused him weeks of uneasiness and has made him delay, from day today, in a very anxious manner. At last he said to me, 'Caddy, ifMiss Summerson, who is a great favourite with my father, could beprevailed upon to be present when I broke the subject, I think Icould do it.' So I promised I would ask you. And I made up mymind, besides," said Caddy, looking at me hopefully but timidly,"that if you consented, I would ask you afterwards to come with meto Ma. This is what I meant when I said in my note that I had agreat favour and a great assistance to beg of you. And if youthought you could grant it, Esther, we should both be verygrateful.""Let me see, Caddy," said I, pretending to consider. "Really, Ithink I could do a greater thing than that if the need werepressing. I am at your service and the darling child's, my dear,whenever you like."Caddy was quite transported by this reply of mine, being, Ibelieve, as susceptible to the least kindness or encouragement asany tender heart that ever beat in this world; and after anotherturn or two round the garden, during which she put on an entirelynew pair of gloves and made herself as resplendent as possible thatshe might do no avoidable discredit to the Master of Deportment, wewent to Newman Street direct.</p> 
<p>　　Prince was teaching, of course. We found him engaged with a notvery hopeful pupil--a stubborn little girl with a sulky forehead, adeep voice, and an inanimate, dissatisfied mama--whose case wascertainly not rendered more hopeful by the confusion into which wethrew her preceptor. The lesson at last came to an end, afterproceeding as discordantly as possible; and when the little girlhad changed her shoes and had had her white muslin extinguished inshawls, she was taken away. After a few words of preparation, wethen went in search of Mr. Turveydrop, whom we found, grouped withhis hat and gloves, as a model of deportment, on the sofa in hisprivate apartment--the only comfortable room in the house. Heappeared to have dressed at his leisure in the intervals of a lightcollation, and his dressing-case, brushes, and so forth, all ofquite an elegant kind, lay about.</p> 
<p>　　"Father, Miss Summerson; Miss Jellyby.""Charmed! Enchanted!" said Mr. Turveydrop, rising with his high-shouldered bow. "Permit me!" Handing chairs. "Be seated!"Kissing the tips of his left fingers. "Overjoyed!" Shutting hiseyes and rolling. "My little retreat is made a paradise."Recomposing himself on the sofa like the second gentleman inEurope.</p> 
<p>　　"Again you find us, Miss Summerson," said he, "using our littlearts to polish, polish! Again the sex stimulates us and rewards usby the condescension of its lovely presence. It is much in thesetimes (and we have made an awfully degenerating business of itsince the days of his Royal Highness the Prince Regent--my patron,if I may presume to say so) to experience that deportment is notwholly trodden under foot by mechanics. That it can yet bask inthe smile of beauty, my dear madam."I said nothing, which I thought a suitable reply; and he took apinch of snuff.</p> 
<p>　　"My dear son," said Mr. Turveydrop, "you have four schools thisafternoon. I would recommend a hasty sandwich.""Thank you, father," returned Prince, "I will be sure to bepunctual. My dear father, may I beg you to prepare your mind forwhat I am going to say?""Good heaven!" exclaimed the model, pale and aghast as Prince andCaddy, hand in hand, bent down before him. "What is this? Is thislunacy! Or what is this?""Father," returned Prince with great submission, "I love this younglady, and we are engaged.""Engaged!" cried Mr. Turveydrop, reclining on the sofa and shuttingout the sight with his hand. "An arrow launched at my brain by myown child!""We have been engaged for some time, father," faltered Prince, "andMiss Summerson, hearing of it, advised that we should declare thefact to you and was so very kind as to attend on the presentoccasion. Miss Jellyby is a young lady who deeply respects you,father."Mr. Turveydrop uttered a groan.</p> 
<p>　　"No, pray don't! Pray don't, father," urged his son. "MissJellyby is a young lady who deeply respects you, and our firstdesire is to consider your comfort."Mr. Turveydrop sobbed.</p> 
<p>　　"No, pray don't, father!" cried his son.</p> 
<p>　　"Boy," said Mr. Turveydrop, "it is well that your sainted mother isspared this pang. Strike deep, and spare not. Strike home, sir,strike home!""Pray don't say so, father," implored Prince, in tears. "It goesto my heart. I do assure you, father, that our first wish andintention is to consider your comfort. Caroline and I do notforget our duty--what is my duty is Caroline's, as we have oftensaid together--and with your approval and consent, father, we willdevote ourselves to making your life agreeable.""Strike home," murmured Mr. Turveydrop. "Strike home!" But heseemed to listen, I thought, too.</p> 
<p>　　"My dear father," returned Prince, "we well know what littlecomforts you are accustomed to and have a right to, and it willalways be our study and our pride to provide those before anything.</p> 
<p>　　If you will bless us with your approval and consent, father, weshall not think of being married until it is quite agreeable toyou; and when we ARE married, we shall always make you--of course--our first consideration. You must ever be the head and masterhere, father; and we feel how truly unnatural it would be in us ifwe failed to know it or if we failed to exert ourselves in everypossible way to please you."Mr. Turveydrop underwent a severe internal struggle and cameupright on the sofa again with his cheeks puffing over his stiffcravat, a perfect model of parental deportment.</p> 
<p>　　"My son!" said Mr. Turveydrop. "My children! I cannot resist yourprayer. Be happy!"His benignity as he raised his future daughter-in-law and stretchedout his hand to his son (who kissed it with affectionate respectand gratitude) was the most confusing sight I ever saw.</p> 
<p>　　"My children," said Mr. Turveydrop, paternally encircling Caddywith his left arm as she sat beside him, and putting his right handgracefully on his hip. "My son and daughter, your happiness shallbe my care. I will watch over you. You shall always live withme"--meaning, of course, I will always live with you--"this houseis henceforth as much yours as mine; consider it your home. Mayyou long live to share it with me!"The power of his deportment was such that they really were as muchovercome with thankfulness as if, instead of quartering himselfupon them for the rest of his life, he were making some munificentsacrifice in their favour.</p> 
<p>　　"For myself, my children," said Mr. Turveydrop, "I am falling intothe sear and yellow leaf, and it is impossible to say how long thelast feeble traces of gentlemanly deportment may linger in thisweaving and spinning age. But, so long, I will do my duty tosociety and will show myself, as usual, about town. My wants arefew and simple. My little apartment here, my few essentials forthe toilet, my frugal morning meal, and my little dinner willsuffice. I charge your dutiful affection with the supply of theserequirements, and I charge myself with all the rest."They were overpowered afresh by his uncommon generosity.</p> 
<p>　　"My son," said Mr. Turveydrop, "for those little points in whichyou are deficient--points of deportment, which are born with a man,which may be improved by cultivation, but can never be originated--you may still rely on me. I have been faithful to my post sincethe days of his Royal Highness the Prince Regent, and I will notdesert it now. No, my son. If you have ever contemplated yourfather's poor position with a feeling of pride, you may restassured that he will do nothing to tarnish it. For yourself,Prince, whose character is different (we cannot be all alike, noris it advisable that we should), work, be industrious, earn money,and extend the connexion as much as possible.""That you may depend I will do, dear father, with all my heart,"replied Prince.</p> 
<p>　　"I have no doubt of it," said Mr. Turveydrop. "Your qualities arenot shining, my dear child, but they are steady and useful. And toboth of you, my children, I would merely observe, in the spirit ofa sainted wooman on whose path I had the happiness of casting, Ibelieve, SOME ray of light, take care of the establishment, takecare of my simple wants, and bless you both!"Old Mr. Turveydrop then became so very gallant, in honour of theoccasion, that I told Caddy we must really go to Thavies Inn atonce if we were to go at all that day. So we took our departureafter a very loving farewell between Caddy and her betrothed, andduring our walk she was so happy and so full of old Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Turveydrop's praises that I would not have said a word in hisdisparagement for any consideration.</p> 
<p>　　The house in Thavies Inn had bills in the windows annoucing that itwas to let, and it looked dirtier and gloomier and ghastlier thanever. The name of poor Mr. Jellyby had appeared in the list ofbankrupts but a day or two before, and he was shut up in thedining-room with two gentlemen and a heap of blue bags, account-books, and papers, making the most desperate endeavours tounderstand his affairs. They appeared to me to be quite beyond hiscomprehension, for when Caddy took me into the dining-room bymistake and we came upon Mr. Jellyby in his spectacles, forlornlyfenced into a corner by the great dining-table and the twogentlemen, he seemed to have given up the whole thing and to bespeechless and insensible.</p> 
<p>　　Going upstairs to Mrs. Jellyby's room (the children were allscreaming in the kitchen, and there was no servant to be seen), wefound that lady in the midst of a voluminous correspondence,opening, reading, and sorting letters, with a great accumulation oftorn covers on the floor. She was so preoccupied that at first shedid not know me, though she sat looking at me with that curious,bright-eyed, far-off look of hers.</p> 
<p>　　"Ah! Miss Summerson!" she said at last. "I was thinking ofsomething so different! I hope you are well. I am happy to seeyou. Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Clare quite well?"I hoped in return that Mr. Jellyby was quite well.</p> 
<p>　　"Why, not quite, my dear," said Mrs. Jellyby in the calmest manner.</p> 
<p>　　"He has been unfortunate in his affairs and is a little out ofspirits. Happily for me, I am so much engaged that I have no timeto think about it. We have, at the present moment, one hundred andseventy families, Miss Summerson, averaging five persons in each,either gone or going to the left bank of the Niger."I thought of the one family so near us who were neither gone norgoing to the left bank of the Niger, and wondered how she could beso placid.</p> 
<p>　　"You have brought Caddy back, I see," observed Mrs. Jellyby with aglance at her daughter. "It has become quite a novelty to see herhere. She has almost deserted her old employment and in factobliges me to employ a boy.""I am sure, Ma--" began Caddy.</p> 
<p>　　"Now you know, Caddy," her mother mildly interposed, "that I DOemploy a boy, who is now at his dinner. What is the use of yourcontradicting?""I was not going to contradict, Ma," returned Caddy. "I was onlygoing to say that surely you wouldn't have me be a mere drudge allmy life.""I believe, my dear," said Mrs. Jellyby, still opening her letters,casting her bright eyes smilingly over them, and sorting them asshe spoke, "that you have a business example before you in yourmother. Besides. A mere drudge? If you had any sympathy with thedestinies of the human race, it would raise you high above any suchidea. But you have none. I have often told you, Caddy, you haveno such sympathy.""Not if it's Africa, Ma, I have not.""Of course you have not. Now, if I were not happily so muchengaged, Miss Summerson," said Mrs. Jellyby, sweetly casting hereyes for a moment on me and considering where to put the particularletter she had just opened, "this would distress and disappoint me.</p> 
<p>　　But I have so much to think of, in connexion with Borrioboola-Ghaand it is so necessary I should concentrate myself that there is myremedy, you see."As Caddy gave me a glance of entreaty, and as Mrs. Jellyby waslooking far away into Africa straight through my bonnet and head, Ithought it a good opportunity to come to the subject of my visitand to attract Mrs. Jellyby's attention.</p> 
<p>　　"Perhaps," I began, "you will wonder what has brought me here tointerrupt you.""I am always delighted to see Miss Summerson," said Mrs. Jellyby,pursuing her employment with a placid smile. "Though I wish," andshe shook her head, "she was more interested in the Borrioboolanproject.""I have come with Caddy," said I, "because Caddy justly thinks sheought not to have a secret from her mother and fancies I shallencourage and aid her (though I am sure I don't know how) inimparting one.""Caddy," said Mrs. Jellyby, pausing for a moment in her occupationand then serenely pursuing it after shaking her head, "you aregoing to tell me some nonsense."Caddy untied the strings of her bonnet, took her bonnet off, andletting it dangle on the floor by the strings, and crying heartily,said, "Ma, I am engaged.""Oh, you ridiculous child!" observed Mrs. Jellyby with anabstracted air as she looked over the dispatch last opened; "what agoose you are!""I am engaged, Ma," sobbed Caddy, "to young Mr. Turveydrop, at theacademy; and old Mr. Turveydrop (who is a very gentlemanly manindeed) has given his consent, and I beg and pray you'll give usyours, Ma, because I never could be happy without it. I never,never could!" sobbed Caddy, quite forgetful of her generalcomplainings and of everything but her natural affection.</p> 
<p>　　"You see again, Miss Summerson," observed Mrs. Jellyby serenely,"what a happiness it is to be so much occupied as I am and to havethis necessity for self-concentration that I have. Here is Caddyengaged to a dancing-master's son--mixed up with people who have nomore sympathy with the destinies of the human race than she hasherself! This, too, when Mr. Quale, one of the firstphilanthropists of our time, has mentioned to me that he was reallydisposed to be interested in her!""Ma, I always hated and detested Mr. Quale!" sobbed Caddy.</p> 
<p>　　"Caddy, Caddy!" returned Mrs. Jellyby, opening another letter withthe greatest complacency. "I have no doubt you did. How could youdo otherwise, being totally destitute of the sympathies with whichhe overflows! Now, if my public duties were not a favourite childto me, if I were not occupied with large measures on a vast scale,these petty details might grieve me very much, Miss Summerson. Butcan I permit the film of a silly proceeding on the part of Caddy(from whom I expect nothing else) to interpose between me and thegreat African continent? No. No," repeated Mrs. Jellyby in a calmclear voice, and with an agreeable smile, as she opened moreletters and sorted them. "No, indeed."I was so unprepared for the perfect coolness of this reception,though I might have expected it, that I did not know what to say.</p> 
<p>　　Caddy seemed equally at a loss. Mrs. Jellyby continued to open andsort letters and to repeat occasionally in quite a charming tone ofvoice and with a smile of perfect composure, "No, indeed.""I hope, Ma," sobbed poor Caddy at last, "you are not angry?""Oh, Caddy, you really are an absurd girl," returned Mrs. Jellyby,"to ask such questions after what I have said of the preoccupationof my mind.""And I hope, Ma, you give us your consent and wish us well?" saidCaddy.</p> 
<p>　　"You are a nonsensical child to have done anything of this kind,"said Mrs. Jellyby; "and a degenerate child, when you might havedevoted yourself to the great public measure. But the step istaken, and I have engaged a boy, and there is no more to be said.</p> 
<p>　　Now, pray, Caddy," said Mrs. Jellyby, for Caddy was kissing her,"don't delay me in my work, but let me clear off this heavy batchof papers before the afternoon post comes in!"I thought I could not do better than take my leave; I was detainedfor a moment by Caddy's saying, "You won't object to my bringinghim to see you, Ma?""Oh, dear me, Caddy," cried Mrs. Jellyby, who had relapsed intothat distant contemplation, "have you begun again? Bring whom?""Him, Ma.""Caddy, Caddy!" said Mrs. Jellyby, quite weary of such littlematters. "Then you must bring him some evening which is not aParent Society night, or a Branch night, or a Ramification night.</p> 
<p>　　You must accommodate the visit to the demands upon my time. Mydear Miss Summerson, it was very kind of you to come here to helpout this silly chit. Good-bye! When I tell you that I have fifty-eight new letters from manufacturing families anxious to understandthe details of the native and coffee-cultivation question thismorning, I need not apologize for having very little leisure."I was not surprised by Caddy's being in low spirits when we wentdownstairs, or by her sobbing afresh on my neck, or by her sayingshe would far rather have been scolded than treated with suchindifference, or by her confiding to me that she was so poor inclothes that how she was ever to be married creditably she didn'tknow. I gradually cheered her up by dwelling on the many thingsshe would do for her unfortunate father and for Peepy when she hada home of her own; and finally we went downstairs into the dampdark kitchen, where Peepy and his little brothers and sisters weregrovelling on the stone floor and where we had such a game of playwith them that to prevent myself from being quite torn to pieces Iwas obliged to fall back on my fairy-tales. From time to time Iheard loud voices in the parlour overhead, and occasionally aviolent tumbling about of the furniture. The last effect I amafraid was caused by poor Mr. Jellyby's breaking away from thedining-table and making rushes at the window with the intention ofthrowing himself into the area whenever he made any new attempt tounderstand his affairs.</p> 
<p>　　As I rode quietly home at night after the day's bustle, I thought agood deal of Caddy's engagement and felt confirmed in my hopes (inspite of the elder Mr. Turveydrop) that she would be the happierand better for it. And if there seemed to be but a slender chanceof her and her husband ever finding out what the model ofdeportment really was, why that was all for the best too, and whowould wish them to be wiser? I did not wish them to be any wiserand indeed was half ashamed of not entirely believing in himmyself. And I looked up at the stars, and thought about travellersin distant countries and the stars THEY saw, and hoped I mightalways be so blest and happy as to be useful to some one in mysmall way.</p> 
<p>　　They were so glad to see me when I got home, as they always were,that I could have sat down and cried for joy if that had not been amethod of making myself disagreeable. Everybody in the house, fromthe lowest to the highest, showed me such a bright face of welcome,and spoke so cheerily, and was so happy to do anything for me, thatI suppose there never was such a fortunate little creature in theworld.</p> 
<p>　　We got into such a chatty state that night, through Ada and myguardian drawing me out to tell them all about Caddy, that I wenton prose, prose, prosing for a length of time. At last I got up tomy own room, quite red to think how I had been holding forth, andthen I heard a soft tap at my door. So I said, "Come in!" andthere came in a pretty little girl, neatly dressed in mourning, whodropped a curtsy.</p> 
<p>　　"If you please, miss," said the little girl in a soft voice, "I amCharley.""Why, so you are," said I, stooping down in astonishment and givingher a kiss. "How glad am I to see you, Charley!""If you please, miss," pursued Charley in the same soft voice, "I'myour maid.""Charley?""If you please, miss, I'm a present to you, with Mr. Jarndyce'slove."I sat down with my hand on Charley's neck and looked at Charley.</p> 
<p>　　"And oh, miss," says Charley, clapping her hands, with the tearsstarting down her dimpled cheeks, "Tom's at school, if you please,and learning so good! And little Emma, she's with Mrs. Blinder,miss, a-being took such care of! And Tom, he would have been atschool--and Emma, she would have been left with Mrs. Blinder--andme, I should have been here--all a deal sooner, miss; only Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Jarndyce thought that Tom and Emma and me had better get a littleused to parting first, we was so small. Don't cry, if you please,miss!""I can't help it, Charley.""No, miss, nor I can't help it," says Charley. "And if you please,miss, Mr. Jarndyce's love, and he thinks you'll like to teach menow and then. And if you please, Tom and Emma and me is to seeeach other once a month. And I'm so happy and so thankful, miss,"cried Charley with a heaving heart, "and I'll try to be such a goodmaid!""Oh, Charley dear, never forget who did all this!""No, miss, I never will. Nor Tom won't. Nor yet Emma. It was allyou, miss.""I have known nothing of it. It was Mr. Jarndyce, Charley.""Yes, miss, but it was all done for the love of you and that youmight be my mistress. If you please, miss, I am a little presentwith his love, and it was all done for the love of you. Me and Tomwas to be sure to remember it."Charley dried her eyes and entered on her functions, going in hermatronly little way about and about the room and folding upeverything she could lay her hands upon. Presently Charley camecreeping back to my side and said, "Oh, don't cry, if you please,miss."And I said again, "I can't help it, Charley."And Charley said again, "No, miss, nor I can't help it." And so,after all, I did cry for joy indeed, and so did she.</p>
