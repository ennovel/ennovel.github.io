'You'll find it all figgered out on this piece of paper. There was that two-acre piece up at Rockville brought seventy-five dollars, the medder fetched a hundred and fifty, the two cows--'</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'How much does it all come to, Uncle Job?' interrupted Ben, who was impatient of details.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'Hadn't you better let me read off the items, nephew?' asked Job, looking over his spectacles.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'No, Uncle Job. I know you've done your best for me, and there's no need of your going through it all. How much is there left after all expenses are paid?'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'That's what I was a-comin' to, Ben. I make it out that there's three hundred and sixty-five dollars and nineteen cents. That's a dollar for every day in the year. It's a good deal of money, Ben.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'So it is, Uncle Job,' answered Ben, and he was quite sincere. There are not many boys of sixteen to whom this would not seem a large sum.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'You're rich; that is, for a boy,' added Uncle Job.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'It's more than I expected, uncle. I want you to take fifteen dollars and nineteen cents. That'll leave me just three hundred and fifty.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'Why should I take any of your money, nephew?'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'You've had considerable trouble in settling up the estate, and it's taken a good deal of your time, too.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'My time ain't of much vally, and as to the trouble, it's a pity ef I can't take some trouble for my brother's son. No, Ben, I won't take a cent. You'll need it all.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'But you said yourself it was a good deal of money for a boy, Uncle Job.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'So it is, but it's all you've got. Most boys have fathers to take care of 'em, while you're alone in the world.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'Yes I am alone in the world,' said Ben sadly, his cheerful face clouding over.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'But you've got an uncle, lad,' continued Job Stanton, laying his hand gently on the boy's shoulder. 'He's a poor man, but as much as in him lies, he'll be your friend and helper.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'I know it, Uncle Job. You've always been kind to me.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'And allus will be, Ben. Now, Ben, I've got a plan for you. I don't know what you'll think of it, but it's the best I've been able to think of.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'What is it, Uncle Job?'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'Ef you'll stay with me and help me in the shop, I'll give you a home, such as it is, and fifty dollars a year toward your clothes. Your Aunt Hannah and your Cousin Jane want you to make your home with us.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'I'm very much obliged to you, Uncle Job,' said Ben slowly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'You needn't be, boy. It's a sort of mutooal arrangement. It'll be as good for me as for you. You can put your money in the bank, and let it stay till you're twenty-one. Why, it'll be nigh on to five hunderd dollars by that time.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'I'm much obliged to you, Uncle Job, as I said before, but there's one thing in the way.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'What's that, Ben?'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'I don't like shoemaking.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'Perhaps it isn't genteel enough for you, Ben,' said his uncle.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'I don't care for that, Uncle Job, but I don't like being shut up in a shop. Besides, it doesn't give steady work. Last year you were without work at least a third of the time.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'So I was, Ben,' said Job. 'I'm willin' to own that's a great drawback.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'And it isn't likely to be any better hereafter. Last year was as good as the average.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'It was better,' Job admitted. 'The year before I was out of work five months.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'Well, Uncle Job, I want to work at something that'll give me employment all the year round.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'So do I, Ben, but I don't see what you can find, unless you go to work on a farm. You're used to that, and I guess you could find a chance before long. There's Deacon Pitkin wants a boy, and would be glad of the chance of gettin' you.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'I suppose he would,' said Ben, laughing. 'Would you advise me to go there?'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'Well, there might be some objections, but-'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'You know I wouldn't get enough to eat, Uncle Job,' interrupted Ben. 'Why, Deacon Pitkin's the meanest man in the village.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'You mustn't be hasty in your judgments, nephew.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'I'm not. I know what I'm talking about. I worked for the deacon two days once. He gave me ten cents a day and board-and such board! Why, I got up from the table hungry every meal, and yet the deacon reported afterward that I was a great eater. Mrs. Pitkin cuts a small pie into eight pieces, each about two mouthfuls, and when I asked for a second piece, she asked if I was allowed to have two pieces at home.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'What did you say?' asked Uncle Job, evidently amused.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'I said yes, and that each piece was twice as big as she gave.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'I'm afraid that was rather forward, Ben. Did she say anything to that?'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'She said I must be very greedy, and that boys always ate more'n was good for 'em. No, Uncle Job, I don't care to work for Deacon Pitkin.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'Have you formed any plans, Ben? You don't want to go on a farm, and you don't want to go into a shoeshop, and that's about all you can find to do in Hampton.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'I don't mean to stay in Hampton,' said Ben quietly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'Don't mean to stay in Hampton!' exclaimed Uncle Joe, amazed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'No, uncle. There's a good many places besides Hampton in the world.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'So there is, Ben,' answered Uncle Job, with a disregard of grammar more excusable than his nephew's, for he had never had any special educational advantages,-'so there is, but you don't know anybody in them other places.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'It won't take me long to get acquainted,' returned Ben, not at all disturbed by this consideration.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'Where do you want to go?'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'I want to go to California.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'Gracious sakes! Want to go to California!' gasped Job. 'What put that idee into your head?'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'A good many people are going there, and there's a chance to get rich quick out among the gold-mines.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'But you're only a boy.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'I'm a pretty large boy, Uncle Job,' said Ben complacently, 'and I'm pretty strong.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'So you be, Ben, but it takes more than strength.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'What more, Uncle Job?'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'It takes judgment.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'Can't a boy have judgment?'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'Waal, he may have some, but you don't often find an old head on young shoulders.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'I know all that, uncle, but I can work if I am a boy.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'I know you're willin' to work, Ben, but it'll cost a sight of money to get out to Californy to start with.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'I know that. It will take two hundred dollars.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'And that's more'n half of all you've got. It seems to me temptin' Providence to spend such a sight of money for the chance of earning some on t'other side of the world, when you can get a livin' here and put all your money in the bank.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'In five years it would only amount to five hundred dollars, and if I go to California, I expect to be worth a good deal more than that before two years are past.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'I'm afraid you've got large idees, Ben.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'You won't interfere with my going, Uncle Job?' asked Ben anxiously.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'I won't actooly interfere, but I'll do all I can to have you give it up.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'But if my mind is set upon it, you'll let me go, won't you, uncle?'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'I suppose I must,' said Job Stanton. 'A wilful lad must have his way. But you mustn't blame me if things turn out unlucky.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'No, I shall only blame myself.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'There's one promise you must make me,' said his uncle.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'What is that?'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'Take a week to consider whether you hadn't better take my advice and stay at home.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'Yes, uncle, I'll promise that.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'And you'll think it over in all its bearin's?'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'Yes, uncle.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'It ain't best to take any important step without reflection, Ben.' 'You're right, uncle.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 This conversation took place in Job Stanton's little shoe-shop, only a rod distant from the small, plain house which he had occupied ever since he had been married. It was interrupted by the appearance of a pretty girl of fourteen, who, presenting herself at the door of the shop, called out:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'Supper's ready, father.'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'So are we, Jennie,' said Ben, promptly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'You are always ready to eat, Ben,' said his cousin, smiling.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 'That's what Mrs. Pitkin used to think, Jennie. She used to watch every mouthful I took.'&nbsp;
