<br> 
<br> As my old readers know, this series was begun some years ago by the publication of “Dave Porter at Oak Hall,” in which my readers were introduced to a wideawake, American boy at an up-to-date American boarding-school. This was followed by “Dave Porter in the South Seas,” where our hero had gone to find his father, and then by “Dave Porter’s Return to School.” After that we had “Dave Porter in the Far North,” where the lad went on a second journey looking for his parent; “Dave Porter and His Classmates,” in which our hero was put to a most unusual test; and then by “Dave Porter at Star Ranch,” in which he took part in many strenuous adventures.
<br> 
<br> From the Wild West Dave returned again to school, as related in “Dave Porter and His Rivals.” Then he took a sea voyage, as told of in “Dave Porter on Cave Island,” and later still taught some of his school chums a much-needed lesson, the particulars of which are given in “Dave Porter and the Runaways.”
<br> 
<br> The lad had imagined his strenuous adventures were now at an end, but this was not to be. He heard of a lost mine, and, with his chums, went in search of it, as related in “Dave Porter in the Gold Fields.” Coming back, he put in some fine times in the Adirondack Mountains, as related in “Dave Porter at Bear Camp.”
<br> 
<br> By this time the lad had graduated from school, and he now took up the study of civil engineering. There was another lad who looked exactly like Dave, and this person caused our hero much trouble, as told of in “Dave Porter and His Double,” where we last met him.
<br> 
<br> In the present volume Dave is still pursuing his calling of civil engineering. He is at work in the mountains when he comes face to face with one of his old-time enemies. Later still word comes to the youth that his dearest girl friend, Jessie Wadsworth, and his sister Laura have disappeared from home. One surprise is followed by another, and the young civil engineer is confronted by many perils.
<br> 
<br> Once again I thank my young readers for the interest they have shown in the various volumes I have written for them. I trust that the reading of this book will benefit them all.
