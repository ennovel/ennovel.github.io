</p><p>Editor:</p><p>GE_TeamWith the help of the Dao Comprehension from the Heavenly Dao under his current state, Ning Fan had improvised the Parting Sun Spear to the grade of an Immortal Realm technique.However, everything has its limitations. The maximum level of this Immortal Realm technique obviously could not attain the Immortal Emperor Realm.It was just an insignificant technique in a battle between immortal emperors. If it is used in the battles against Life Immortal Realm beings or True Immortal Realm beings, it would be more impactful.This was the limitation of the Parting Sun Spear. Even if it had divided into multiple illusory shadows, it only possessed such destructive power.Of course, if Ning Fan could make some changes on its illusory form, he perhaps would be able to make this technique stronger. However, even though Ning Fan had achieved this state, he was still unable to comprehend the changes he could make on the technique.The future development of this technique would be restricted regardless.Ning Fan’s eyes turned slightly cold. He no longer wanted to improvise the Parting Sun Spear. He should focus on much greater techniques. After improvising them, only could he gain more insights.Eventually, all of this would serve as a preparation for him to comprehend the final technique.Hence, he changed his mind. Since he is going to improvise magic techniques to complete the comprehension of the final technique, he, of course, would have to focus on stronger techniques.Then, he began to move forward step by step. Each of his steps could connect to the great momentum of the Heavenly Dao.When he made the first step, heaven and earth crumbled.When he made the fifth step, the great momentum was destroyed.When he made the ninth step, the sovereign sword took form!Ning Fan’s eyes were filled with a hint of surprise. He had never expected that when he improvised his Nine Step, Sky Treader to its maximum level, it could actually break the great momentum and merge with the sovereign’s aura!One million traces of sovereign qi turned into one million traces of pure golden deadly swords. After he had taken nine steps in midair, the might of the swords had arrived at their peak!The one million traces of sovereign qi were undeniably left by Tai Su.Seeing Ning Fan who was just a Divine Transformation Realm cultivator discover the way to use sovereign qi, be it Tai Su or Mo Luo, both of them were slightly amazed.Those who were able to discover the threshold of sovereign qi at the Void Fragmentation Realm would be regarded as sovereigns. They were considered to be individuals who were born to have close affinity for the sovereign qi.However, Ning Fan had comprehended the sovereign qi at the Divine Transformation Realm. This reflected an extremely significant meaning.At first, Ning Fan was reluctant to use sovereign qi in order to avoid being discovered by the Rain Sovereign and bring a huge trouble to himself.Fortunately, the place where he was displaying his sovereign qi now was the dream realm in his state of mind. No outsider would find out about it.Besides, compared to the Rain Sovereign, Mo Luo obviously was hundreds of millions of times more dangerous.Thus, he naturally would not mind using his sovereign qi.After completing the nine steps in the sky, all of the one million sovereign swords which had replaced the swords formed from the great momentum of heaven and earth flew towards Mo Luo. The destructive power of this strike was already not something that Mo Luo could underestimate.Mo Luo’s eyes glinted with a hint of seriousness. He began to feel that letting Ning Fan improvise his techniques was a mistake.However, his pride did not allow himself to fear a Divine Transformation Realm junior.Even if the magic power of a Divine Transformation Realm junior had been increased to the Immortal Emperor Realm using a secret technique and that cultivator had obtained comprehensions from the Heavenly Dao after achieving the unity of heaven and man, the difference between him and a true immortal emperor was worlds apart. There was nothing he could do to resist a true immortal emperor!With a wave of his hand, Mo Luo sent out one billion traces of devil flames. Devil flames filled the whole skies, incinerating each and every one of the sovereign swords.His tone of voice was as disdainful as before.“I’ve already used one billion traces of devil flames… If you can’t show me a greater technique, you will certainly die today!”“Don’t worry. I won’t disappoint you!”Ning Fan had devised the advancement method for the Nine Step, Sky Treader.His heart became even more silent. He closed his eyes and black qi rose from his body gradually.Even though it was also a black qi, it was completely different from Mo Luo’s. It was the qi that was transformed from his black spirit sense.Ning Fan’s black hair floated gently in the wind. He slowly reopened his cold eyes and the left part of his face was covered with demon marks.The sleeves of his black robes as wind blew. The aura force he gave out became even more unfathomable.“An incarnation? This incarnation is rather familiar… This is…Immortal Emperor Tai Chang’s Sense Soul Incarnation Chant!” This time, it was Immortal Emperor Tai Su who was shocked by Ning Fan’s technique.He did not expect that the trump cards that Ning Fan displayed would have a more significant origin than the ones before.“First, it was the sovereign qi. Then, it’s an incarnation. This young man has comprehended two types of Void Fragmentation Realm secret techniques when he’s just at the Divine Transformation Realm. His potential is considered to be unrivalled… However, if it’s just the incarnation, it’s still certainly impossible for him to be an equal match to Great Emperor Mo Luo. Immortal Emperor Tai Chang’s strength was not much inferior to me. However, his Sense Soul Incarnation Chant was good at defense but weak in attacking opponents…”Tai Su muttered to himself. However, at the next moment, he suddenly stopped talking.Ning Fan whose eyes were mercilessly icy took a step forward and his incarnation dispersed all of a sudden.Within his mind, he was constantly studying the Heavenly Dao, figuring the method to improve his Black Tempest Rupture Art.“Disperse, condense and repeat. Dispersing from a tangible body is actually the principle of void. Recondensing the body again is actually the principle of true. I don’t know about the principle of void, much less the principle of true. However, I understand… the ingenious fusion between the two principles. With my current abnormal state, I should be able to comprehend something about that balance…”“Condense!”Countless traces of black sense instantly turned into an illusory black figure and charged at Mo Luo. Each trace of power that constituted the black figure was all sword sense.Mo Luo was slightly stunned. He did not expect that Ning Fan still possessed sword sense. However, with this level of sword sense, Ning Fan could not harm him at all.Showing a hint of mockery, he just activated a trace of devil flame to incinerate that black figure.“Weak. Too weak! This level of attack can’t hurt me at all!”Just as his voice fell, his eyes were filled with surprise at the next moment.He only saw that when the single black figure was incinerated, it split into two figures. When the two figures were incinerated, they split into four figures.After times and times of dispersal and recondensation, the number of black figures became greater. Eventually, there were ten billion traces of black figures!The destructive power of each of the black shadows was slightly stronger than Mo Luo’s devil flams.If this ten billion traces of black figures disperse and recondense at the same time, the conversion of power between being real and illusory would be enough to wipe out all Mo Luo’s ten billion traces of devil flames. It could even injure Mo Luo!“This technique…”Mo Luo was stunned. But at the next second, his expression became relieved. It was because the ten billion traces of black shadows that Ning Fan had forcibly created exploded and scattered one after another. He had failed in displaying this technique!The reason why he would fail was not because he improved the technique in the wrong direction. This technique of summoning ten billion black figures of himself had even made both Tai Su and Mo Luo feel amazed.The reason why Ning Fan would fail was just because the strength of spirit sense that Tai Su had given to Ning Fan was not enough to display this technique!When one cultivates the Black Tempest Rupture Art to the level of summoning ten billion clones, the requirement for the level of the caster’s spirit sense was especially high.Even Tai Su’s spirit sense was not enough to display this technique.If the level of Ning Fan’s spirit sense is a little higher which could allow him to display the ten billion traces of black shadows, he would definitely have the confidence of injuring Mo Luo in a single strike.This technique was indeed really strong! Of course, the condition was that Ning Fan needed to be able to display it.“I failed, huh…”Ning Fan was not disappointed. In contrast, he was rather satisfied.He finally saw the direction of cultivating his Black Rupture Tempest Art. In the future, he could increase the number of his clones when killing his enemies.The secret technique in Ning Fan was gradually diminishing.The Immortal Emperor Realm magic power was also slowly weakening.Ning Fan did not intend to delay any further. He would only make use of this opportunity to improvise those magic techniques which were worthy to be improved as much as possible.His eyes flashed. There was still one technique he wanted to improve… Soul Extraction!In the past, he only knew how to extract the soul of the great earth and mountains and rivers.Today, however, after he witnessed Mo Luo display the Soul Extraction, he only knew that he could also extract the soul of the skies, the souls of the sun, the moon and the stars and the soul of the Heavenly Dao other than the soul of the earth.The Heavenly Dao only had a single soul and it was extracted by Mo Luo now.However, Ning Fan who currently had a close connection with the Heavenly Dao could faintly tell that the actual soul of the Heavenly Dao was still yet to be completely extracted by Mo Luo.There were still many souls… The souls of the diverted Dao!At this moment, Ning Fan gained an insight about extracting the soul of the Heavenly Dao. Besides, he had even comprehended the Soul Extraction Technique which was a level higher than extracting the soul of the Heavenly Dao.However, what he found laughable about himself was that he might be able to clearly see through the most profound Soul Extraction Technique but he could not understand the technique of extracting the soul of the void space which was ranked second weakest.The reason why he could not see through it was because his comprehension towards the word “void” was not deep enough.Unless he gains a deeper understanding about the void, he would not be able to extract the soul of the void.Now, however, with the Immortal Emperor Realm magic power, he could extract the soul beyond the Heavenly Dao and nullify Mo Luo’s technique!“The Heavenly Dao is only one Dao… The Six Dao are the true foundation of all Dao… The current me can’t comprehend what Dao is but I can forcibly extract some of the soul of the Six Dao. It might not be enough to increase my magic power, but it can nullify your Soul Extraction Technique! The soul of Six Dao, extract!”Ning Fan extended his five fingers. Even though he had yet to completely understand the technique of extracting the soul of the Dao, he was able to seize the soul of the Heavenly Dao from Mo Luo in his current state.The Six Dao reversed and the Heavenly Dao turned chaotic. The power of the soul collapsed!Mo Luo felt like his chest had received a heavy blow as he fell back three steps before he could regain his balance. His expression turned extremely grim like he was about to kill his opponent. A trace of blood had actually flowed out from the corners of his mouth.Due to his carelessness, Ning Fan had managed to seize the soul he had extracted from him, causing him to suffer a backlash!“Extracting the soul of the Six Dao? Good. Very good! You won’t have another chance to improvise your magic technique. You have truly enraged me!’Mo Luo’s eyes flashed with cold light. A rush of intense and ferocious devil qi suddenly permeated heaven and earth.Ten billion devil eyes shot out their devil flames simultaneously, carrying the formidable destructive power that could incinerate the entire heavens and a myriad of worlds!Each trace of devil flames was like a meteorite colliding against him. As soon as Ning Fan took the impact, he immediately coughed out blood incessantly and fell back continuously. The injuries he suffered became more and more severe.With such severity of his injuries, it was certainly impossible to be healed using his black stars. The only thing he could depend on was the Immortal Emperor Realm magic power within him to heal his physical body automatically.However, healing his physical body depleted too much of his magic power. During the time when he was falling back for hundreds of steps, Ning Fan had already depleted half of the magic power that Tai Su had given to him.“We can’t delay it any longer. Hurry up and act! This devil has already lost his patience!” Tai Su warned.“Mm.”After making a few improvisations on his magic techniques, Ning Fan felt even easier and more composed when controlling the Immortal Emperor Realm magic power.He might still be nowhere near the other immoral emperors, but among all cultivators at the First Step of the Dao Cultivation, even Void Fragmentation Realm old monsters would not dare to say that they had a better manipulation on the magic power than Ning Fan.Ning Fan did not waste the slightest trace of the magic power. Every single trace of them was completely used in defending and attacking his opponent.His mind replayed the memories of the elegant demeanor of the man while displaying that palm technique. The figure of that man in purple robes became more obscure that Ning Fan could not figure out who he was.Who was he? Who was he…A familiar person or a stranger…?Have I met him before or not…?With the help of the comprehension and view from the Heavenly Dao, the movement of each trace of the magic power that was used to condense the palm gradually became crystal-clear in Ning Fan’s heart.Five fingers form a palm. The first five fingers of the Heaven Breaking Sword Finger combined into one…“First, break the ethereal island, rivers and mountain!”The first finger that could break mountains and rivers had the destructive power of killing Nascent Soul Realm cultivators!“Second, crush the vast heavens and black sun!”The second finger that could crush the sun and cause the heavens to incline had the destructive power to eliminate Divine Transformation Realm cultivators!“Third, pulverize the void space and dead bones!”All the corpses and bones of those individuals who died in the void space emerged one after another and turned to ashes. The sword finger that was condensed from the dead qi in the void space could eliminate Void Refinement Realm beings!“Fourth, shatter the emperor’s shadow and remaining mausoleum!”Each of the ancient tombs which were condensed from sovereign qi appeared in the vast sky but each of them crumbled as soon as they appeared. Each time one of them crumbled, they would definitely be a sovereign qi sword that was at the level of the First Heavenly Layer of the Void Fragmentation Realm pierced into the vault of heavens. If one hundred tombs crumble, a Void Fragmentation Realm shall perish. If ten thousand tombs crumble, a Life Immortal Realm being shall be injured!“Fifth, smash the imprisoning heavens and immortal’s path!”Each of the paths that led to the heavens collapsed at once. Each time a path collapsed, there would be an immortal imprisoning sword which would be enough to kill a Life Immortal Realm expert destroying everything, sweeping the entire void space.Each of the immortal imprisoning swords had the destructive power to eliminate a Life Immortal Realm being!With Ning Fan’s previous understanding, the first five fingers of the sword finger technique had to be displayed in accordance with their sequence continuously.Today, however, he had displayed each of the five swords using each of his five fingers and all of the five swords combined into one.A golden purple mist rose from the center of his palm. Under his Wind Mist Technique, the five sword fingers gradually condensed into a golden purple palm imprint.The fifth finger of the five sword fingers he had displayed was only sufficient to kill an ordinary Life Immortal Realm being.However, when all five of them were combined into one, Ning Fan only felt that his magic power had channeled into the palm imprint like a flood current. The destructive power of this palm imprint could eliminate a True Immortal Realm being!While evading the attacks of the devil flames, Ning Fan condensed the palm imprint.Ning Fan had been devising in his mind countless times but he could not devise the following steps in condensing the palm.Perhaps the profound principle that this palm technique contained had already exceeded the Heavenly Dao in this world.He began to understand that the reason why the five fingers had to be condensed using the golden purple wind mist was because this technique would need to borrow its power of Samsara.The principle that this palm imprint portrayed should be Samsara.The principle of Samsara that the Wind Mist Technique presented was about indifference and helplessness when everything returns to its original form, just as the saying goes: ashes to ashes, dust to dust.As for the Wind Snow Technique, it was about the determination of making everything stay even if one has to freeze Samsara.This palm imprint, however, was different.“When that man in the jade slip was displaying this palm imprint, he had merged his own Dao Sense into it…”“He wanted to manipulate Samsara with this palm!”“Immortal Realm Technique, One Hand Covers the Heavens!”Ning Fan pushed out his palm. A kind of aura force that was hard to describe was given off by that palm.At the same moment, the jade slip broke. A vague figure of a man flew out. It then gradually condensed into a gigantic purple shadow behind Ning Fan. The appearance of that gigantic shadow was surprising to Mo Luo and Tai Su. Other than Ning Fan, both of them had seen that man in purple robes.He was the peerless cultivator who vowed to control Samsara. He was the one who created this ‘One Hand Covers the Heavens’!Tai Su had met that man before. It was him who gave Tai Su the jade slip consisting of the palm imprint technique.Mo Luo had also met that man before. When he saw the appearance of that person, he also could not help but feel fearful from the bottom of his heart, despite his arrogance.“The jade slip was actually sealed with a Dao Sense from him! It’s him! It’s him!”“It’s him! But… how is this possible?! He clearly has already died!”“No. It’s not him… If it’s him, there’s no way I can remember him. He does not allow anyone to remember him!”“Yes. It turns out to be him but not him… But I should not know him and I should also have not met him before. Where was it…?”“Detestable. Someday when seventy percent of my devil sense breaks out from the suppression, I will certainly figure out all of this and find out the exact reasons behind it! Today, however, I have to flee!”Mo Luo was actually afraid to battle!Even if his opponent was an immortal emperor or the number one emperor of the nine devil emperors, he would also not be afraid.But this trace of gigantic purple shadow was one of the individuals who he would certainly be not daring to mess with!Whether his guess was correct or wrong, he could not afford to provoke this individual!“Who is it?!”Ning Fan was inwardly shocked. He intended to turn around and looked at the appearance of the person but he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his Sea of Consciousness. At the moment the appearance of that person entered his vision, all his memories about it were wiped out, making him no longer remember the appearance.The only thing he could remember was the friendly and warm smile on that person’s face.Who is this man?!“You aren’t half bad. With your potential, it is enough for you to defeat Mo Luo after gaining a bit of comprehension about this palm. However, you will inevitably let him escape. I have already foreseen today’s situation in the past. The reason why I left the jade slip was none other than aiding you to dispel this disaster. However, this is the only chance I can help you in this life. Otherwise…”“Forget it. There’s no point talking too much. Suppressing this devil is my true objective. It’s considered to put an end to the debt of gratitude and resentment in the past.”“Helping you is just an accident. However, this accident is also within Samsara. You will understand it someday.”Just as the voice of the man in purple robes entered Ning Fan’s ears, they were literally erased without leaving any trace. It did not give anyone a chance to perform divination on it.There would only be a single time for him to come here and help Ning Fan.The cost of him lending a hand this time was the destruction of this trace of Dao Sense.He was not a living person nor a deceased man. However, he must not reveal himself.From the beginning until now, Ning Fan could not figure out whether this man was Teacher Zi Dou. However, that person had already acted without hesitation to suppress Mo Luo on Ning Fan’s behalf.“I will help you eliminate the thirty percent of this devil’s devil sense. As for the seventy percent devil sense that is being suppressed by the Mo Luo Mountain, you shall go to the Devil World to eliminate it yourself once you gain sufficient cultivation base!”The gigantic purple shadow took a step forward and emanated a terrifyingly immense aura force which directly crushed all of the ten billion devil eyes.Mo Luo was very strong. However, in the face of this mysterious man in purple robes, he was nothing.“You can’t do this! My slave, Liu Yi, has once guarded the Six Dao. He has met you before. He has met you before!”“So what if he has met me before?!”The man in purple robes smiled coldly. When he pushed out one of his palms, the five fingers of Heaven Breaking Sword Finger formed into a palm. A golden purple palm imprint fell upon Mo Luo.Mo Luo was in panic. He wanted to flee. But no matter where he fled to, the gigantic golden purple palm imprint would always be above his head.When he enlarged his devil body, the palm imprint also became bigger accordingly. When he turned himself as small as a molecule of dust, the palm imprint also became smaller. It would never allow Mo Luo to get out of its grasp regardless.The palm imprint got closer and closer to Mo Luo. The latter’s eyes were filled with absolute shock, as if he was about to be scared to death. It was difficult for him to continue evading.As the palm imprint was about to land on his body, he activated all the defenses on his physical body. However, as soon as the palm imprint touched him, his physical body disintegrated completely!One Hands Covers the Heavens. There was no way to run!“Ah!”A loud painful shriek echoed across the air. Mo Luo who only had thirty percent of strength was instantly killed!The gigantic devil mountain behind him also vanished along with him.The blood mist that permeated the air after his death gradually turned into a droplet of black devil blood.He only left his final words which were filled with resentment. Mo Luo still had seventy percent of his devil sense that was being suppressed by the Mo Luo Mountain. From this point onwards, absolute hatred was what he had for Ning Fan!“Young man, I’ll remember you. Just wait. I will find my next devil slave in the next one million years. Then, I will certainly break out from the mountain! There won’t be a second Tai Su the next time who will ignite his own Dao Sense to save you. His Dao has truly extinguished but I just lost thirty percent of my cultivation base!”“You! Just wait and see!”Then, the voice fell.The man in purple robes drew the drop of devil blood into his hand and scrutinized it. He seemed to have thought of something as his eyes were filled with recollections.“The blood of Mo Luo…” The purple-robed man sighed with emotions. With a flick of his finger, he shot the devil blood into Ning Fan’s body.After displaying the palm imprint, he had already depleted all the power of his Dao Sense. Hence, his gigantic shadow began to dissipate little by little.At the end of the day, he was just a trace of Dao Sense and he was not a true living person.He was about to perish but before he left, he stared deeply at Ning Fan.He was not looking at Ning Fan but… Tai Su instead.His mouth moved, as if he was telling Tai Su something with telepathy and Ning Fan was unable to hear anything. The only thing he picked up was the gasp of disbelief from Tai Su.“The karma of that year is ended today. Are you satisfied with this outcome?” The man in purple robes smiled faintly and his shadow became even more indistinct.“*Sigh* I’m satisfied… Unexpectedly, it will end up like this.” Obviously, Tai Su felt rather surprised.What was the connection among the purple-robed man, Tai Su and Mo Luo exactly? Ning Fan did not know about it.Was the purple-robed man actually Zi Dou? Why did he need to conceal his identity? Ning Fan also had no answers for those doubts.The only thing that Ning Fan knew was that thirty percent of Mo Luo’s devil sense had already been eliminated. The man in purple robes was about to disappear and Tai Su’s Dao was going to vanish from this world as his Dao Sense had almost burnt out.All of this was just like a dream.At the beginning of the dream, there was only Ning Fan.At the end of the dream, three peerless experts were going to leave one after another. The only person that was left was still Ning Fan.“The devil race has lost its blood. Even though this Mo Luo’s blood is only one drop, it is a great opportunity for you. After assimilating it, you will have the chance to become the next Mo Luo!”The man in purple robes let out a hearty laughter. Then, with a bang, his gigantic shadow disappeared.Just as his shadow vanished, Immortal Emperor Tai Su seemed like he wanted to say something but he did not open his mouth in the end.He turned into a ray of lightning and got out of Ning Fan’s body, turning into an elderly man in red robes again.As for Ning Fan, exhaustion instantly overwhelmed him, nearly making him fall asleep.“Thank you Immortal Emperor Tai Su for saving my life!” Ning Fan cupped his fist and expressed his gratitude.“Thank me? Originally, I thought in that way as well. However, I didn’t think it would end up like this… After all, whether you thank me or not, it’s just an empty dream.” It seemed like Immortal Emperor Tai Su was still immersed in the words from the man in purple robes and could not let them go.“I wonder what request does Senior has for me? As long as it’s something that this junior can do, I will definitely give my all to help!” Even though it was the mysterious purple-robed man who eliminated Mo Luo in the end and saved him from this disaster, if it wasn’t Tai Su who lent him a hand at the beginning, it would be impossible for him survive.He was not a person of noble character but he was not a villain as well. When he owes someone a debt of gratitude, he would, of course, repay them!“My request…” Tai Su’s eyes turned slightly stern. He wanted to say something and he decided otherwise in the end.“Well, this matter is hard to explain in just a conversation. I will condense my message into a jade slip. You will know it after you take a look at the jade slip. Whether you can accomplish it or not, you have to do it with all your strength. True Lightning World is my hometown. I’ll count on you for the rest.”Tai Su extended his five fingers and condensed a jade slip with his lightning power. Then, he passed it to Ning Fan.His eyes flashed with some recollections. The person whom he missed and longed for was a white-hair old lady that he had not met for many years. Whether she was alive or dead, it was unknown.“You are much more fortunate than me to have such an infatuated woman who sacrifice for you so much… Mind Purifying Virtuous Incantation. The backlash that this woman will suffer is certainly very serious.”“What is Senior talking about? Why do I find it a little incomprehensible?” Ning Fan asked confusedly.“If you don’t know about it, then so be it. Whether you are heartless or fickle in love, I have one reminder for you… pick the flowers earlier when they are in full blossom… That woman is not bad. Young man, cherish her!”Tai Su closed his eyes sentimentally. He was already dead in the first place. Today, on the other hand, he just experienced the extinguishment of his own Dao.To immortal emperors, the extinguishment of Dao was just dying once again after they were dead.At this moment, what he longed for was not the respect and fame he had gained in his lifetime or his status in Dao Comprehension but just the resentful look from a white-haired old lady.“Fei Feng…”Tai Su muttered the last name and slowly disappeared.At the moment he disappeared, Ning Fan could clearly sense that a trace of Dao Power from the Heavenly Dao had vanished…The disappearance of this trace of Dao Power implied that the position of the Lightning Wielding Immortal Emperor that had been vacant for many years would be vacant once again!This incident would probably stir an uproar in the Four Heavens. However, no one would find out that one peerless expert in purple robes and two immortals emperors had fallen one after another today in this place.Someone was truly dead. Someone was just partially dead. Someone experienced the extinguishment of his Dao. Who was real and who was fake? No one could clearly tell.If it wasn’t for the overwhelming tiredness that was reminding Ning Fan…If it wasn’t for the memories of the improvisations he had made on a few types of magic techniques in his mind…If it wasn’t for the traces of qi of the Dao Power left by the Heavenly Dao…Ning Fan would surely think that all of this was really just a dream.Now, the dream ended and it was time to wake up!“The black primordial spirit wanted to command me to become Mo Luo’s slave. I wonder what expression will he have when he finds out that thirty percent of Mo Luo’s devil sense is eliminated!”Ning Fan sneered. In the finger bone, blood-red lightning flashed ferociously all of a sudden.Within the blood-lightning, there was also a drop of black devil blood that nourished Ning Fan’s primordial spirit.At the next moment, Ning Fan’s primordial spirit was seething with great devil qi. He opened his eyes.He did not show any signs of being polluted by the devil qi. At this moment, he could control his devil qi at his will.“How come you are awake already?!” Within his dantian, the black primordial spirit was still resisting the lightning power from Ning Fan’s finger bone with all his strength, attempting to gain the control of Ning Fan’s body completely and make him a slave to Mo Luo.However, he did not expect that Ning Fan’s primordial spirit that had been injured by the devil qi would wake up at this moment. Besides, just as Ning Fan’s primordial spirit woke up, he gave him an irresistible feeling.That feeling originated form the drop of devil blood which Ning Fan had devoured!“Didn’t you want to become Mo Luo’s slave? I have devoured a drop of Mo Luo’s blood. The current me is Mo Luo!”Ning Fan’s primordial spirit revealed a cold and indifferent look. In a flash, he turned to the dantian and regained the control over his body.At this moment, Ning Fan’s gigantic body that had been demonized returned to his original look.At this moment, Ning Fan’s primordial spirit reoccupied his dantian. His miniature primordial spirit wore a set of golden armor and trampled upon the black primordial spirit. His eyes flashed with killing intent.“Impossible! This is definitely impossible! Why would Lord Mo Luo’s blood in your hands?! Unless he is dead, his devil blood…”“Precisely. He’s dead!” Ning Fan sneered.“I don’t believe you! I don’t believe you! This must be fake!” The black primordial spirit behaved like he had lost his sanity as he laughed for a moment but cried at the next.He wholeheartedly wanted to become Mo Luo’s slave. In his heart, Mo Luo was the strongest.However, Ning Fan knew that Mo Luo was not the strongest. Tai Su was not the strongest. Even the peerless man in purple robes was not necessarily the strongest.In this world, there is no the strongest being.Whoever could walk until the end of the Dao would be the strongest. Unfortunately, no one knew where the end of the Dao was.Ning Fan had really experienced how it felt to be a strong being this time by achieving the unity of heaven and man and having the temporary boost of his strength to the Immortal Emperor Realm.I really can’t be complacent and self-satisfied anymore…Perhaps one million years later, Ning Fan would have a fight with Mo Luo who manages to break out from the mountain. Perhaps that battle would be much nearer than the actual date.However, Ning Fan would be a true immortal emperor by that time. He would let Mo Luo know that the junior he once underestimated had already become a being whom he could only admire.“I still have a long path to go… You, on the other hand, can die now. The next person to die will be King Ying Long!”Ning Fan’s eyes flashed with cold light. He opened his mouth and swallowed the black primordial spirit. The devil qi within him became even stronger.After that, he assimilated the devil blood and completely digested the finger bone.Mo Luo’s blood, Tai Su’s bone and the technique from the mysterious man in purple robes had all fallen into Ning Fan’s hands.The hidden danger of Mo Luo’s devil marks seemed to have been eliminated. However, if he wants to continue improving the grades of his devil marks, he would still need to make a trip to the Giant Sect Clan once.Ju Mo(Giant Devil), Liu Yi(Six Wings), Lan Jiao(Mist Horn) and Gui Mu(Ghost Eye) were all Mo Luo’s slaves.Thus, they must have extremely deep and profound research about the devil marks.In the end, Ning Fan was still unable to completely assimilate the devil blood. It seemed like he had no other option but to improve his devil marks to the marshal rank in order to assimilate that drop of blood. When the time comes, perhaps he would find out the use of ‘blood’.As for the Immortal Emperor’s Finger Bone, Ning Fan was able to refine it with ease.Originally, the risk of refining the emperor bone was rather high. However, Tai Su had no hostility towards Ning Fan. Thus, his bone also had no resistance against the latter to devour it.The process of devouring the bone was pretty smooth.After digesting the bone, Ning Fan’s magic power experienced a sharp increase and arrived at six hundred and fifty thousand units.The increase in his magic power was just one small part of the effect. The bigger part was the improvement in his physical body.The strength of his physical body had broken through to the Peak Level of Jade Life Realm. He was now just a hair’s breadth away from the Golden Body Realm.Ning Fan was aware that the breakthrough to the Golden Body Realm was going to be very difficult.However, his corpse devil body had made his physical body at the Peak Level of Jade Life Realm not weaker than an ordinary expert with Golden Body Realm at all.As for the devil form that consisted the features of Lan Jiao, Liu Yi and Gui Mu, if he transformed into that form, he could probably put up a fight against a cultivator at the Second Level of Golden Body Realm!After all, this devil form was the manifestation which his second primordial spirit imitated from Mo Luo. It combined the advantageous features from the four great devil clans in the Internal Endless Sea. Its might was without a doubt extraordinary.As such, if Ning Fan activates his devil form and goes all-out, he could literally kill Void Glimpse Stage cultivators in an instant.Moreover, with the lightning armor which gave him an additional advantage in defense, he could even withstand attacks from Void Inquiry Stage experts.Therefore, it was not necessarily that he could not win against King Ying Long!The only thing he had to consider was that his devil form was unable to maintain a stable condition and the reason was apparently because he had yet to completely assimilate the devil blood. If he turns into that form during combat, that form could not last for too long. He had to finish the battle quickly and swiftly.“Mo Luo’s devil manifestation, huh… After I have turned into that form, I can instantly eliminate a Void Glimpse Stage cultivator. That is an undeniable fact.”The agreed time between him and Lei Shiyi was about to arrive.Ning Fan’s primordial spirit returned to its position. He dismissed his devil form and returned to a normal young man in a set of white robes.He did not immediately leave the Profound Yin World. When he had recovered himself, his expression changed. He was dazed.Beside him, a pale woman in white robs was depleting all her magic power and channeling the power from her primordial spirit to nourish Ning Fan’s primordial spirit.Her ten fingers were performing a hand seal. The light chant of the Sanskrit words had the divine effect of dispelling devil qi.Ning Fan was very familiar to that rush of magic power which was as cool as autumn water…That was the cooling magic power that woke him up while he was nearly lost in Mo Luo’s devil sound.“The other person who saved me is actually Little You’er! When did she wake up?!”Ning Fan did not know about it. The only thing he knew now was that Luo You whose primordial spirit power was gradually recovering had become weak and frail again because of channeling her power to save Ning Fan.Fortunately, her current state was not as severe as before when Ning Fan first treated her.Her qi was greatly damaged but she was not at a level so serious that she needed to slumber. Only her primordial spirit was extremely weak and she needed rest and nourishment.“You…are…already…fine…aren’t…you…” Seeing Ning Fan wake up, Luo You felt relieved as if she had let go of a heavy rock in her heart. Her frown loosened and she then gave Ning Fan a faint smile.“That’s good…”Her vision went black and she fell into Ning Fan’s embrace without consciousness…“How did this happen…?”Ning Fan’s eyes turned solemn. Unconsciously, he had owed Luo You a huge favor.Besides, he could tell that the reason why Luo You saved him this time was different from the past…All of a sudden, he seemed to understand the words which Immortal Emperor Tai Su said to him.The good woman that Tai Su mentioned was probably referring to Luo You…“A cunning little woman. When did you wake up? How did you get past my senses…? If you wake up the next time, I will certainly not let you pretend to be asleep again. Now, however, you should take a good rest…”Ning Fan carefully lifted Luo You in his arms and returned to the thatched cottage step by step. Then, he helped Luo You slightly stabilize her weak primordial spirit.I think it’ll be better if I request a few tufts of one hundred thousand years old spiritual medicine from Hong Yi after helping her to harmonize a few dark golden bamboo leaves to treat Luo You…After this incident, it would be even more impossible for Ning Fan to leave Luo You in the lurch.
