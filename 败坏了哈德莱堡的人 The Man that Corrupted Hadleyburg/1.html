Hadleyburg was the most honest and upright town in all the region round about. It had kept that reputation unsmirched during three generations, and was prouder of it than of any other of its possessions. It was so proud of it, and so anxious to insure its perpetuation, that it began to teach the principles of honest dealing to its babies in the cradle, and made the like teachings the staple of their culture thenceforward through all the years devoted to their education. Also, throughout the formative years temptations were kept out of the way of the young people, so that their honesty could have every chance to harden and solidify, and become a part of their very bone. The neighbouring towns were jealous of this honourable supremacy, and affected to sneer at Hadleyburg's pride in it and call it vanity; but all the same they were obliged to acknowledge that Hadleyburg was in reality an incorruptible town; and if pressed they would also acknowledge that the mere fact that a young man hailed from Hadleyburg was all the recommendation he needed when he went forth from his natal town to seek for responsible employment.</p> 
<p>But at last, in the drift of time, Hadleyburg had the ill luck to offend a passing stranger--possibly without knowing it, certainly without caring, for Hadleyburg was sufficient unto itself, and cared not a rap for strangers or their opinions. Still, it would have been well to make an exception in this one's case, for he was a bitter man, and revengeful. All through his wanderings during a whole year he kept his injury in mind, and gave all his leisure moments to trying to invent a compensating satisfaction for it. He contrived many plans, and all of them were good, but none of them was quite sweeping enough: the poorest of them would hurt a great many individuals, but what he wanted was a plan which would comprehend the entire town, and not let so much as one person escape unhurt. At last he had a fortunate idea, and when it fell into his brain it lit up his whole head with an evil joy. He began to form a plan at once, saying to himself "That is the thing to do--I will corrupt the town."</p> 
<p>Six months later he went to Hadleyburg, and arrived in a buggy at the house of the old cashier of the bank about ten at night. He got a sack out of the buggy, shouldered it, and staggered with it through the cottage yard, and knocked at the door. A woman's voice said "Come in," and he entered, and set his sack behind the stove in the parlour, saying politely to the old lady who sat reading the "Missionary Herald" by the lamp:</p> 
<p>"Pray keep your seat, madam, I will not disturb you. There--now it is pretty well concealed; one would hardly know it was there. Can I see your husband a moment, madam?"</p> 
<p>No, he was gone to Brixton, and might not return before morning.</p> 
<p>"Very well, madam, it is no matter. I merely wanted to leave that sack in his care, to be delivered to the rightful owner when he shall be found. I am a stranger; he does not know me; I am merely passing through the town to-night to discharge a matter which has been long in my mind. My errand is now completed, and I go pleased and a little proud, and you will never see me again. There is a paper attached to the sack which will explain everything. Good- night, madam."</p> 
<p>The old lady was afraid of the mysterious big stranger, and was glad to see him go. But her curiosity was roused, and she went straight to the sack and brought away the paper. It began as follows:</p> 
<p>"TO BE PUBLISHED, or, the right man sought out by private inquiry-- either will answer. This sack contains gold coin weighing a hundred and sixty pounds four ounces--"</p> 
<p>"Mercy on us, and the door not locked!"</p> 
<p>Mrs. Richards flew to it all in a tremble and locked it, then pulled down the window-shades and stood frightened, worried, and wondering if there was anything else she could do toward making herself and the money more safe. She listened awhile for burglars, then surrendered to curiosity, and went back to the lamp and finished reading the paper:</p> 
<p>"I am a foreigner, and am presently going back to my own country, to remain there permanently. I am grateful to America for what I have received at her hands during my long stay under her flag; and to one of her citizens--a citizen of Hadleyburg--I am especially grateful for a great kindness done me a year or two ago. Two great kindnesses in fact. I will explain. I was a gambler. I say I WAS. I was a ruined gambler. I arrived in this village at night, hungry and without a penny. I asked for help--in the dark; I was ashamed to beg in the light. I begged of the right man. He gave me twenty dollars--that is to say, he gave me life, as I considered it. He also gave me fortune; for out of that money I have made myself rich at the gaming-table. And finally, a remark which he made to me has remained with me to this day, and has at last conquered me; and in conquering has saved the remnant of my morals: I shall gamble no more. Now I have no idea who that man was, but I want him found, and I want him to have this money, to give away, throw away, or keep, as he pleases. It is merely my way of testifying my gratitude to him. If I could stay, I would find him myself; but no matter, he will be found. This is an honest town, an incorruptible town, and I know I can trust it without fear. This man can be identified by the remark which he made to me; I feel persuaded that he will remember it.</p> 
<p>"And now my plan is this: If you prefer to conduct the inquiry privately, do so. Tell the contents of this present writing to any one who is likely to be the right man. If he shall answer, 'I am the man; the remark I made was so-and-so,' apply the test--to wit: open the sack, and in it you will find a sealed envelope containing that remark. If the remark mentioned by the candidate tallies with it, give him the money, and ask no further questions, for he is certainly the right man.</p> 
<p>"But if you shall prefer a public inquiry, then publish this present writing in the local paper--with these instructions added, to wit: Thirty days from now, let the candidate appear at the town-hall at eight in the evening (Friday), and hand his remark, in a sealed envelope, to the Rev. Mr. Burgess (if he will be kind enough to act); and let Mr. Burgess there and then destroy the seals of the sack, open it, and see if the remark is correct: if correct, let the money be delivered, with my sincere gratitude, to my benefactor thus identified."</p> 
<p>Mrs. Richards sat down, gently quivering with excitement, and was soon lost in thinkings--after this pattern: "What a strange thing it is! . . . And what a fortune for that kind man who set his bread afloat upon the waters! . . . If it had only been my husband that did it!--for we are so poor, so old and poor! . . ." Then, with a sigh--"But it was not my Edward; no, it was not he that gave a stranger twenty dollars. It is a pity too; I see it now. . . " Then, with a shudder--"But it is GAMBLERS' money! the wages of sin; we couldn't take it; we couldn't touch it. I don't like to be near it; it seems a defilement." She moved to a farther chair. . . "I wish Edward would come, and take it to the bank; a burglar might come at any moment; it is dreadful to be here all alone with it."</p> 
<p>At eleven Mr. Richards arrived, and while his wife was saying "I am SO glad you've come!" he was saying, "I am so tired--tired clear out; it is dreadful to be poor, and have to make these dismal journeys at my time of life. Always at the grind, grind, grind, on a salary--another man's slave, and he sitting at home in his slippers, rich and comfortable."</p> 
<p>"I am so sorry for you, Edward, you know that; but be comforted; we have our livelihood; we have our good name--"</p> 
<p>"Yes, Mary, and that is everything. Don't mind my talk--it's just a moment's irritation and doesn't mean anything. Kiss me--there, it's all gone now, and I am not complaining any more. What have you been getting? What's in the sack?"</p> 
<p>Then his wife told him the great secret. It dazed him for a moment; then he said:</p> 
<p>"It weighs a hundred and sixty pounds? Why, Mary, it's for-ty thou- sand dollars--think of it--a whole fortune! Not ten men in this village are worth that much. Give me the paper."</p> 
<p>He skimmed through it and said:</p> 
<p>"Isn't it an adventure! Why, it's a romance; it's like the impossible things one reads about in books, and never sees in life." He was well stirred up now; cheerful, even gleeful. He tapped his old wife on the cheek, and said humorously, "Why, we're rich, Mary, rich; all we've got to do is to bury the money and burn the papers. If the gambler ever comes to inquire, we'll merely look coldly upon him and say: 'What is this nonsense you are talking? We have never heard of you and your sack of gold before;' and then he would look foolish, and--"</p> 
<p>"And in the meantime, while you are running on with your jokes, the money is still here, and it is fast getting along toward burglar- time."</p> 
<p>"True. Very well, what shall we do--make the inquiry private? No, not that; it would spoil the romance. The public method is better. Think what a noise it will make! And it will make all the other towns jealous; for no stranger would trust such a thing to any town but Hadleyburg, and they know it. It's a great card for us. I must get to the printing-office now, or I shall be too late."</p> 
<p>"But stop--stop--don't leave me here alone with it, Edward!"</p> 
<p>But he was gone. For only a little while, however. Not far from his own house he met the editor--proprietor of the paper, and gave him the document, and said "Here is a good thing for you, Cox--put it in."</p> 
<p>"It may be too late, Mr. Richards, but I'll see."</p> 
<p>At home again, he and his wife sat down to talk the charming mystery over; they were in no condition for sleep. The first question was, Who could the citizen have been who gave the stranger the twenty dollars? It seemed a simple one; both answered it in the same breath -</p> 
<p>"Barclay Goodson."</p> 
<p>"Yes," said Richards, "he could have done it, and it would have been like him, but there's not another in the town."</p> 
<p>"Everybody will grant that, Edward--grant it privately, anyway. For six months, now, the village has been its own proper self once more- -honest, narrow, self-righteous, and stingy."</p> 
<p>"It is what he always called it, to the day of his death--said it right out publicly, too."</p> 
<p>"Yes, and he was hated for it."</p> 
<p>"Oh, of course; but he didn't care. I reckon he was the best-hated man among us, except the Reverend Burgess."</p> 
<p>"Well, Burgess deserves it--he will never get another congregation here. Mean as the town is, it knows how to estimate HIM. Edward, doesn't it seem odd that the stranger should appoint Burgess to deliver the money?"</p> 
<p>"Well, yes--it does. That is--that is--"</p> 
<p>"Why so much that-IS-ing? Would YOU select him?"</p> 
<p>"Mary, maybe the stranger knows him better than this village does."</p> 
<p>"Much THAT would help Burgess!"</p> 
<p>The husband seemed perplexed for an answer; the wife kept a steady eye upon him, and waited. Finally Richards said, with the hesitancy of one who is making a statement which is likely to encounter doubt,</p> 
<p>"Mary, Burgess is not a bad man."</p> 
<p>His wife was certainly surprised.</p> 
<p>"Nonsense!" she exclaimed.</p> 
<p>"He is not a bad man. I know. The whole of his unpopularity had its foundation in that one thing--the thing that made so much noise."</p> 
<p>"That 'one thing,' indeed! As if that 'one thing' wasn't enough, all by itself."</p> 
<p>"Plenty. Plenty. Only he wasn't guilty of it."</p> 
<p>"How you talk! Not guilty of it! Everybody knows he WAS guilty."</p> 
<p>"Mary, I give you my word--he was innocent."</p> 
<p>"I can't believe it and I don't. How do you know?"</p> 
<p>"It is a confession. I am ashamed, but I will make it. I was the only man who knew he was innocent. I could have saved him, and-- and--well, you know how the town was wrought up--I hadn't the pluck to do it. It would have turned everybody against me. I felt mean, ever so mean; ut I didn't dare; I hadn't the manliness to face that."</p> 
<p>Mary looked troubled, and for a while was silent. Then she said stammeringly:</p> 
<p>"I--I don't think it would have done for you to--to--One mustn't-- er--public opinion--one has to be so careful --so--" It was a difficult road, and she got mired; but after a little she got started again. "It was a great pity, but-- Why, we couldn't afford it, Edward--we couldn't indeed. Oh, I wouldn't have had you do it for anything!"</p> 
<p>"It would have lost us the good-will of so many people, Mary; and then--and then--"</p> 
<p>"What troubles me now is, what HE thinks of us, Edward."</p> 
<p>"He? HE doesn't suspect that I could have saved him."</p> 
<p>"Oh," exclaimed the wife, in a tone of relief, "I am glad of that. As long as he doesn't know that you could have saved him, he--he-- well that makes it a great deal better. Why, I might have known he didn't know, because he is always trying to be friendly with us, as little encouragement as we give him. More than once people have twitted me with it. There's the Wilsons, and the Wilcoxes, and the Harknesses, they take a mean pleasure in saying 'YOUR FRIEND Burgess,' because they know it pesters me. I wish he wouldn't persist in liking us so; I can't think why he keeps it up."</p> 
<p>"I can explain it. It's another confession. When the thing was new and hot, and the town made a plan to ride him on a rail, my conscience hurt me so that I couldn't stand it, and I went privately and gave him notice, and he got out of the town and stayed out till it was safe to come back."</p> 
<p>"Edward! If the town had found it out--"</p> 
<p>"DON'T! It scares me yet, to think of it. I repented of it the minute it was done; and I was even afraid to tell you lest your face might betray it to somebody. I didn't sleep any that night, for worrying. But after a few days I saw that no one was going to suspect me, and after that I got to feeling glad I did it. And I feel glad yet, Mary--glad through and through."</p> 
<p>"So do I, now, for it would have been a dreadful way to treat him. Yes, I'm glad; for really you did owe him that, you know. But, Edward, suppose it should come out yet, some day!"</p> 
<p>"It won't."</p> 
<p>"Why?"</p> 
<p>"Because everybody thinks it was Goodson."</p> 
<p>"Of course they would!"</p> 
<p>"Certainly. And of course HE didn't care. They persuaded poor old Sawlsberry to go and charge it on him, and he went blustering over there and did it. Goodson looked him over, like as if he was hunting for a place on him that he could despise the most; then he says, 'So you are the Committee of Inquiry, are you?' Sawlsberry said that was about what he was. 'H'm. Do they require particulars, or do you reckon a kind of a GENERAL answer will do?' 'If they require particulars, I will come back, Mr. Goodson; I will take the general answer first.' 'Very well, then, tell them to go to hell--I reckon that's general enough. And I'll give you some advice, Sawlsberry; when you come back for the particulars, fetch a basket to carry what is left of yourself home in.'"</p> 
<p>"Just like Goodson; it's got all the marks. He had only one vanity; he thought he could give advice better than any other person."</p> 
<p>"It settled the business, and saved us, Mary. The subject was dropped."</p> 
<p>"Bless you, I'm not doubting THAT."</p> 
<p>Then they took up the gold-sack mystery again, with strong interest. Soon the conversation began to suffer breaks--interruptions caused by absorbed thinkings. The breaks grew more and more frequent. At last Richards lost himself wholly in thought. He sat long, gazing vacantly at the floor, and by-and-by he began to punctuate his thoughts with little nervous movements of his hands that seemed to indicate vexation. Meantime his wife too had relapsed into a thoughtful silence, and her movements were beginning to show a troubled discomfort. Finally Richards got up and strode aimlessly about the room, ploughing his hands through his hair, much as a somnambulist might do who was having a bad dream. Then he seemed to arrive at a definite purpose; and without a word he put on his hat and passed quickly out of the house. His wife sat brooding, with a drawn face, and did not seem to be aware that she was alone. Now and then she murmured, "Lead us not into t . . . but--but--we are so poor, so poor! . . . Lead us not into . . . Ah, who would be hurt by it?--and no one would ever know . . . Lead us . . . " The voice died out in mumblings. After a little she glanced up and muttered in a half-frightened, half-glad way -</p> 
<p>"He is gone! But, oh dear, he may be too late--too late . . . Maybe not--maybe there is still time." She rose and stood thinking, nervously clasping and unclasping her hands. A slight shudder shook her frame, and she said, out of a dry throat, "God forgive me--it's awful to think such things--but . . . Lord, how we are made--how strangely we are made!"</p> 
<p>She turned the light low, and slipped stealthily over and knelt down by the sack and felt of its ridgy sides with her hands, and fondled them lovingly; and there was a gloating light in her poor old eyes. She fell into fits of absence; and came half out of them at times to mutter "If we had only waited!--oh, if we had only waited a little, and not been in such a hurry!"</p> 
<p>Meantime Cox had gone home from his office and told his wife all about the strange thing that had happened, and they had talked it over eagerly, and guessed that the late Goodson was the only man in the town who could have helped a suffering stranger with so noble a sum as twenty dollars. Then there was a pause, and the two became thoughtful and silent. And by-and-by nervous and fidgety. At last the wife said, as if to herself,</p> 
<p>"Nobody knows this secret but the Richardses . . . and us . . . nobody."</p> 
<p>The husband came out of his thinkings with a slight start, and gazed wistfully at his wife, whose face was become very pale; then he hesitatingly rose, and glanced furtively at his hat, then at his wife--a sort of mute inquiry. Mrs. Cox swallowed once or twice, with her hand at her throat, then in place of speech she nodded her head. In a moment she was alone, and mumbling to herself.</p> 
<p>And now Richards and Cox were hurrying through the deserted streets, from opposite directions. They met, panting, at the foot of the printing-office stairs; by the night-light there they read each other's face. Cox whispered:</p> 
<p>"Nobody knows about this but us?"</p> 
<p>The whispered answer was:</p> 
<p>"Not a soul--on honour, not a soul!"</p> 
<p>"If it isn't too late to--"</p> 
<p>The men were starting up-stairs; at this moment they were overtaken by a boy, and Cox asked,</p> 
<p>"Is that you, Johnny?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, sir."</p> 
<p>"You needn't ship the early mail--nor ANY mail; wait till I tell you."</p> 
<p>"It's already gone, sir."</p> 
<p>"GONE?" It had the sound of an unspeakable disappointment in it.</p> 
<p>"Yes, sir. Time-table for Brixton and all the towns beyond changed to-day, sir--had to get the papers in twenty minutes earlier than common. I had to rush; if I had been two minutes later--"</p> 
<p>The men turned and walked slowly away, not waiting to hear the rest. Neither of them spoke during ten minutes; then Cox said, in a vexed tone,</p> 
<p>"What possessed you to be in such a hurry, I can't make out."</p> 
<p>The answer was humble enough:</p> 
<p>"I see it now, but somehow I never thought, you know, until it was too late. But the next time--"</p> 
<p>"Next time be hanged! It won't come in a thousand years."</p> 
<p>Then the friends separated without a good-night, and dragged themselves home with the gait of mortally stricken men. At their homes their wives sprang up with an eager "Well?"--then saw the answer with their eyes and sank down sorrowing, without waiting for it to come in words. In both houses a discussion followed of a heated sort--a new thing; there had been discussions before, but not heated ones, not ungentle ones. The discussions to-night were a sort of seeming plagiarisms of each other. Mrs. Richards said:</p> 
<p>"If you had only waited, Edward--if you had only stopped to think; but no, you must run straight to the printing-office and spread it all over the world."</p> 
<p>"It SAID publish it."</p> 
<p>"That is nothing; it also said do it privately, if you liked. There, now--is that true, or not?"</p> 
<p>"Why, yes--yes, it is true; but when I thought what a stir it would make, and what a compliment it was to Hadleyburg that a stranger should trust it so--"</p> 
<p>"Oh, certainly, I know all that; but if you had only stopped to think, you would have seen that you COULDN'T find the right man, because he is in his grave, and hasn't left chick nor child nor relation behind him; and as long as the money went to somebody that awfully needed it, and nobody would be hurt by it, and--and--"</p> 
<p>She broke down, crying. Her husband tried to think of some comforting thing to say, and presently came out with this:</p> 
<p>"But after all, Mary, it must be for the best--it must be; we know that. And we must remember that it was so ordered--"</p> 
<p>"Ordered! Oh, everything's ORDERED, when a person has to find some way out when he has been stupid. Just the same, it was ORDERED that the money should come to us in this special way, and it was you that must take it on yourself to go meddling with the designs of Providence--and who gave you the right? It was wicked, that is what it was--just blasphemous presumption, and no more becoming to a meek and humble professor of--"</p> 
<p>"But, Mary, you know how we have been trained all our lives long, like the whole village, till it is absolutely second nature to us to stop not a single moment to think when there's an honest thing to be done--"</p> 
<p>"Oh, I know it, I know it--it's been one everlasting training and training and training in honesty--honesty shielded, from the very cradle, against every possible temptation, and so it's ARTIFICIAL honesty, and weak as water when temptation comes, as we have seen this night. God knows I never had shade nor shadow of a doubt of my petrified and indestructible honesty until now--and now, under the very first big and real temptation, I--Edward, it is my belief that this town's honesty is as rotten as mine is; as rotten as yours. It is a mean town, a hard, stingy town, and hasn't a virtue in the world but this honesty it is so celebrated for and so conceited about; and so help me, I do believe that if ever the day comes that its honesty falls under great temptation, its grand reputation will go to ruin like a house of cards. There, now, I've made confession, and I feel better; I am a humbug, and I've been one all my life, without knowing it. Let no man call me honest again--I will not have it."</p> 
<p>"I-- Well, Mary, I feel a good deal as you do: I certainly do. It seems strange, too, so strange. I never could have believed it-- never."</p> 
<p>A long silence followed; both were sunk in thought. At last the wife looked up and said:</p> 
<p>"I know what you are thinking, Edward."</p> 
<p>Richards had the embarrassed look of a person who is caught.</p> 
<p>"I am ashamed to confess it, Mary, but--"</p> 
<p>"It's no matter, Edward, I was thinking the same question myself."</p> 
<p>"I hope so. State it."</p> 
<p>"You were thinking, if a body could only guess out WHAT THE REMARK WAS that Goodson made to the stranger."</p> 
<p>"It's perfectly true. I feel guilty and ashamed. And you?"</p> 
<p>"I'm past it. Let us make a pallet here; we've got to stand watch till the bank vault opens in the morning and admits the sack. . . Oh dear, oh dear--if we hadn't made the mistake!"</p> 
<p>The pallet was made, and Mary said:</p> 
<p>"The open sesame--what could it have been? I do wonder what that remark could have been. But come; we will get to bed now."</p> 
<p>"And sleep?"</p> 
<p>"No; think."</p> 
<p>"Yes; think."</p> 
<p>By this time the Coxes too had completed their spat and their reconciliation, and were turning in--to think, to think, and toss, and fret, and worry over what the remark could possibly have been which Goodson made to the stranded derelict; that golden remark; that remark worth forty thousand dollars, cash.</p> 
<p>The reason that the village telegraph-office was open later than usual that night was this: The foreman of Cox's paper was the local representative of the Associated Press. One might say its honorary representative, for it wasn't four times a year that he could furnish thirty words that would be accepted. But this time it was different. His despatch stating what he had caught got an instant answer:</p> 
<p>"Send the whole thing--all the details--twelve hundred words."</p> 
<p>A colossal order! The foreman filled the bill; and he was the proudest man in the State. By breakfast-time the next morning the name of Hadleyburg the Incorruptible was on every lip in America, from Montreal to the Gulf, from the glaciers of Alaska to the orange-groves of Florida; and millions and millions of people were discussing the stranger and his money-sack, and wondering if the right man would be found, and hoping some more news about the matter would come soon--right away.</p>

<p>这件事已经过去多年了。当时哈德莱堡是四里八乡最诚实、最正直的一个镇子。它把这种从没有污点的名望一直保持了三辈儿，并且以此为荣，把这种名望看得重于它拥有的其他一切。这种自豪感是如此强烈，保持这种荣誉的愿望是如此迫切，以至于镇子里的婴儿在摇篮里就开始接受诚实信念的熏陶，而且，这一类的教诲还要作为主要内容，在以后对他们进行教育时贯穿始终。另外，在整个发育期里，青年人要与一切诱惑彻底隔绝，这样，他们的诚实就能够利用一点一滴的机会变得坚定而牢固，成为他们的主心骨。邻近的那些镇子都嫉妒这种至高无上的荣耀，他们表面上对哈德莱堡人以诚实为荣冷嘲热讽，说那是虚荣心作怪；然而，他们也不得不承认哈德莱堡的的确确是一个腐蚀不了的镇子；再追问下去，他们还会承认：一个想离家出外找一个好工作的青年人，如果他是从哈德莱堡出去的，那么，他除了自己老家的牌子以外，就用不着带什么推荐信了。</p> 
<p>然而，日久天长，哈德莱堡因为得罪一位过路的外地人终于倒了霉——这件事他们也许出于无心，肯定也没有在意，因为哈德莱堡功德圆满，所以，无论是外乡人的闲言碎语，还是高谈阔论，哈德莱堡人都无须在意。可话又说了回来，早知此人是个爱记仇、不好惹的家伙，当初对他破破例不就万事大吉了吗？整整一年的功夫，那人无论走到哪儿，肚子里总憋着在哈德莱堡受的委屈，只要一有空闲，就挖空心思地琢磨怎么能报复一下，让自己心里舒坦。他想了好多好多的主意，这些主意全都不错，可没有一个十全十美的；要害之处在于：这些主意只能一个一个地伤害好多人，而他想要的却是能把全镇一网打尽的办法，不能有一条未受伤害的漏网之鱼。最后他灵机一动，想到了一个主意，这主意刚冒出来，他的脑海中就被幸灾乐祸的光芒照得通明透亮。他马上开始拟定一项实施方案，还自言自语地说：“就这么办——我要把那个镇子拉下水！”</p> 
<p>六个月之后，他坐着一辆轻便马车再次来到哈德莱堡，约摸晚上十点钟左右，马车停在了银行老出纳员的大门外。他从马车上搬下一只口袋，扛着它跌跌撞撞地穿过院子，敲了敲门。一个女人的声音说了声“请进”，他就进去了。他把那只口袋放在客厅里火炉的后面，客客气气地向正在灯下坐着看《教友导报》的老太太说：</p> 
<p>“您只管坐着好了，太太，我不打扰您。好了——现在这东西藏得严严实实；谁想知道它在哪儿可不容易了。太太，我能见见您先生吗？”</p> 
<p>“不成，他上布里克斯顿了，也许过半夜才能回来。”</p> 
<p>“很好，太太，这不要紧。我只不过是想让您先生照管一下这只口袋，如果他找到了物主，就转交给他。我是外地人，您先生不认识我；今天夜里我是特意路经这个镇子，了却我搁了好久的一桩心事。现在事情已经办妥，我可以走了，我很高兴，还稍稍有点儿得意，以后你们再也不会见到我了。口袋上别着一张字条，上面把所有的事都说清楚了。晚安，太太。”</p> 
<p>这位老太太害怕这个神山鬼没的大个子外地人，见他走了心里才踏实。不过她的好奇心被引逗了起来，就直奔口袋而去，取下了那张字条。上面开头的话是：</p> 
<p>请予公布；或者用私访的办法找到物主——只要能找到物主，无论哪一种办法皆可。这个口袋里装的是金币，重一百六十磅零四盎司——</p> 
<p>“老天，门没锁呀！”</p> 
<p>理查兹太太哆哆嗦嗦地扑过去把门锁上，然后把窗帘放下来，战战兢兢地站在那儿，提心吊胆，思量还有什么办法能让自己和那一口袋钱更保险一点儿。她竖起耳朵听听有没有贼，过了一会儿，她抵挡不住好奇心，又回到灯下，看完了那张纸上的话：</p> 
<p>我是个外国人，马上就要回本国去，在那里常住。我在贵国旗下逗留了很长时间，多蒙贵国关照，不胜感谢；对于贵国的一位公民——一位哈德莱堡的公民——我更想格外致以谢意，因为一两年前他有大恩于我。事实上，那是两桩恩德。容我细说端详。我曾经是个赌徒。我的意思是，我过去是个赌徒。一个输得精光的赌徒。那天夜里我来到这个镇子的时候，腹内空空，身无分文。我向人求告——是在黑影里，我不好意思在亮处乞讨。我求对人了。他给了我二十块钱——也可以说，他给了我一条命，我当时就是这么想的。他还给了我财运；因为我靠那笔钱在赌场里发了大财。还有最后一条：当时他对我说过的一句话我记在心上，直到如今。这句话最后让我口服心服；因为口服心服，我才良心发现，再也不赌了。现在我并不知道他是谁，可是我要找到他，让他得到这笔钱，至于他是把钱给人，扔掉，还是自己留着，全都由他。这只不过是我知恩图报的方式罢了。假士。我可以在此地逗留，我本来会自己去找他；不过没有关系。一定能找到他的。这是个诚实的镇子，腐蚀不了的镇子，我知道我可以信任它，不用担心。凭那位先生当年对我说的那句话，就可以确定哪一位是我的恩人；我相信他一定还记得那句话。</p> 
<p>现在我有这样一个办法：假如您愿意进行私访，悉听尊便。把这张纸上写的话告诉每一个可能是那位先生的人，假如他回答说，“我就是那个人；我当初说过怎样的一句话，”就请核实一下——也就是说：打开口袋，您能在口袋里找到一个装着那句话的密封信袋。如果那位候选人所说的话与此相符，那就把这笔钱交给他，不用再问下去了，因为他无疑就是那位先生。</p> 
<p>如果您愿意公开寻访，就请把这番话发表在本地报纸上——再加上如下说明，即：从当日起三十天内，请申领人于（星期五）晚八时光临镇公所，将他当初所说的话密封交给（如果他肯费心料理的话）伯杰斯牧师；请伯杰斯先生届时到场，把钱袋上的封条去掉，打开钱袋，看与袋内的话是否相符；如果相符，就请将这笔钱连同我的衷心谢意一起，交给我的这位已经确认身份的恩人。</p> 
<p>理查兹太太坐下来，先是激动得颤颤巍巍，很快又陷入了沉思——她的思路如下：“这可真是件蹊跷事儿！……那个好心人蜻蜓点水施舍了几个小钱，瞧这份回报！……这件好事要是我丈夫干的就好了！——因为我们太穷了，这么老了，还这么穷！……”这时她叹了一口气——“可这并不是我的爱德华干的；不是，给外地人二十块钱的不是他。这可真不巧，真的；现在我明白了……”这时她打了个冷战——“不过，这是赌徒的钱哪！是不清不白得来的：这种钱咱们可不能拿，连沾都不能沾。我可要离它远远的；这钱一看就赃兮兮的。”她换了把远一点的椅子坐下来——“我盼着爱德华回来，把这钱拿到银行去；说不定什么时候小偷就会来；一个人在这儿守着它真难熬啊。”</p> 
<p>十一点钟的时候，理查兹先生回来了，他妻子迎头就说：“你可回来了！”他却说：“我太累了——累得要死；过穷日子可真不容易，到了这个岁数还要出这种苦差。就为那点儿薪水，熬来熬去熬不出头，……给人家当奴才；可人家趿拉着拖鞋在家里坐着，有的是钱，真舒坦哪。”</p> 
<p>“为了你，我有多难过呀，爱德华，这你都知道；不过，你得想开点儿：咱们的日子总算还过得去；咱们的名声也不错……”</p> 
<p>“是呀，玛丽，这比什么都要紧哪。我刚才说的话你别放在心上——我就是一阵儿想不开，算不了什么。亲亲我——好了，什么事也没了，我也不再发牢骚了。你弄什么东西来了？口袋里有什么？”</p> 
<p>于是，他妻子把那个天大的秘密告诉了他。一阵天旋地转之后，他说：</p> 
<p>“一百六十磅重？唉，玛丽，那得有四——万——块钱哪——想想——一大笔财产啊！咱们镇子上有这么多财产的人过不了十个。给我看看那张纸。”</p> 
<p>他把那张字条扫了一遍，说：</p> 
<p>“这可是出了奇了！嘿，简直就像小说一样；和书上那些没影的事一样，平常谁见过这样的事呀。”这时他激动起来，神采奕奕，兴高采烈。他打着哈哈弹弹老太婆的脸蛋儿，说：“嗨，咱们发财了，玛丽，发财了。咱们只要把这些钱埋起来；把这张纸一烧就行了。要是那个赌徒再来打听，咱们只要爱理不理地瞪着他，说： ‘你说什么胡话呀？我们从来没听说过你，也没听说过你那条什么金子口袋。’那时候，他就傻了眼，还有——”</p> 
<p>“还有，你就顺嘴说笑话吧，那一袋子钱可还堆在这儿哪，眼看就要到贼出门的时候了。”</p> 
<p>“你说得对。好吧，那咱们怎么办呢——私访？不行，不能这么办：那可就把这篇小说糟蹋啦。还是挑明了好。想想看，这件事得闹出多大的动静来！还不让别的镇子全都嫉妒死。在这种事情上，除了哈德莱堡，一个外乡人还能信得过谁呀，这一点他们心里都有数。这不是给咱们镇子金榜题名吗。我现在就得到报馆的印刷厂去，要不然就来不及了。”</p> 
<p>“慢着——慢着——别把我一个人留在这儿守着它呀，爱德华！”</p> 
<p>可是他已经走了。不过只走了一小会儿。在离家不远的地方，他就遇见了报馆的主笔兼老板。理查兹把那篇文字交给他说：“我有一篇好东西给你，考克斯——登出来吧。”</p> 
<p>“可能太晚了，理查兹先生，不过我看一看吧。”</p> 
<p>回到家里，他和妻子坐下来又把这件迷人的蹊跷事谈论了一遍；两个人一丝睡意都没有。第一个问题是，那位给过外乡人二十块钱的公民会是谁呢？这个问题似乎很简单；夫妻俩不约而同地说了出来：</p> 
<p>“巴克利·古德森。”</p> 
<p>“不错，”理查兹说，“这样的事他干得出来，这也正是他的作派，像他这样的人镇子里再也挑不出第二个了。”</p> 
<p>“谁都会这么说，爱德华——不管当众怎么样，背后谁都会这么说。到如今有六个月了吧，咱们镇子又变成原来那个老样子啦——诚实，小心眼，老子天下第一，还老虎屁股摸不得。”</p> 
<p>“他向来都是这么说的，一直说到咽气的那一天——还一点儿都不避人。”</p> 
<p>“是呀，就为了这个，他才遭人恨。”</p> 
<p>“嗨，就是；不过他倒不在乎。叫我说，除了伯杰斯牧师，在咱们这些人当中，最遭人恨的就是他了。”</p> 
<p>“可伯杰斯遭人恨是活该呀——在这块地方，他再也别想有人听他布道了。虽说这镇子也没什么出息，可人们对他总还是心里有数的。爱德华，这个外乡人指名让伯杰斯发这笔钱，这件事看起来是不是有点怪呀？”</p> 
<p>“哎，对——是有点怪。那是——那是——”</p> 
<p>“哪来的这么多‘那是’呀？换了你会挑他吗？”</p> 
<p>“玛丽，说不定那个外乡人比这镇子上的人更了解他哪。”</p> 
<p>“这话说得再多，也帮不了伯杰斯的忙！”</p> 
<p>丈夫似乎左右为难，不知说什么好；妻子直瞪瞪地盯住他，等着他答话。理查兹后来犹犹豫豫地开口了，好像明知道他的话要受到质疑：</p> 
<p>“玛丽，伯杰斯不是个坏人呀。”</p> 
<p>他妻子自然是吃了一惊。</p> 
<p>“胡说！”她叫了起来。</p> 
<p>“他不是个坏人。这我明白。他人缘不好，都是因为那一件事——就是闹得沸沸扬扬的那一件事。”</p> 
<p>“那‘一件事’，太对啦！就那‘一件事”还不够大么？”</p> 
<p>“够大了。够大了。只不过那件事不是他的错啊。”</p> 
<p>“你说什么！不是他的错！谁都知道，就是他作的孽！”</p> 
<p>“玛丽，你听我的——他是清白的。”</p> 
<p>“我没法相信，我不信。你是怎么知道的？”</p> 
<p>“这是不打自招。我没脸说，可是我非得说出来不可。只有我一个人知道他清白。我本来能够救他，可是——可是——唉，你知道那时候全镇子上的人一边倒——我哪有勇气说出来呀。一说出来大家就都冲着我来了。我也觉得那样做不够意思，太不够意思了，可是我不敢哪；我没有勇气和众人对着干。”</p> 
<p>玛丽一副心烦意乱的样子，一声不吭。过了一会儿，她吞吞吐吐地说：</p> 
<p>“我——我想你就是——就是—— 也没有什么用处。人可不能——呃——大家伙的看法——不能不那么小心——那么——”这条路不大好走，她绕不出来了；可是，稍停一会儿，她又开了腔。“要说这件事是不大合适，可是——嗨，咱们顶不住呀，爱德华——真是顶不住啊。哎，无论如何，我也不愿让你说出来！”</p> 
<p>“玛丽，假如说出来，不知会有多少人不拿正眼看咱们；那样一来——那样一来——”</p> 
<p>“现在我担心的是他怎么看咱们，爱德华。”</p> 
<p>“他？他可没想过我当初能够救他。”</p> 
<p>“啊，”妻子松了一口气，嚷嚷着，“这样我就高兴了。只要他当初不知道你能够救他，他——他——呃，这件事就好办多了。唉，我原本就该想到他不知道，虽然咱们不大搭理他，可他老是想跟咱们套近乎。别人拿这件事挖苦我可不止一次了。像威尔逊两口子，威尔科克斯两口子，还有哈克内斯两口子，他们都话里有话地寻开心，明知道我面子上过不去，非要说‘你们的朋友伯杰斯’如何如何。我可不想让他一个劲儿缠着咱们；我不明白他为什么不撒手呢。”</p> 
<p>“他为什么这样做我明白。这可又是不打自招了。那件事刚闹出来，正在沸沸扬扬的时候，镇上打算让他‘爬竿’。我被良心折磨得简直受不了，偷偷去给他通风报信，他就离开镇子，到外地避风去了，直躲到没事儿了才回来。”</p> 
<p>“爱德华！当时镇上要是查出来——”</p> 
<p>“别说了！直到现在我一想起来还害怕呢。那件事刚做完我就后悔了；所以我都没敢跟你说，就怕你脸上挂不住，被别人看出来。那天晚上，我心里嘀咕，一夜都没有合眼。可是过了几天，一看谁也没有怀疑，从那以后我又觉得干了那么一件事挺高兴。到现在我还高兴呢，玛丽——别提有多高兴了。”</p> 
<p>“现在我也高兴啊，那样对待他也太可怕了。是呀，我挺高兴；你知道，你这样做才算对得起他。可是，爱德华，万一这件事哪天露了馅呢？”</p> 
<p>“不会。”</p> 
<p>“为什么？”</p> 
<p>“因为谁都会以为那是古德森干的。”</p> 
<p>“他们一定是这么想的！”</p> 
<p>“就是。当然啦，他也不在乎大家这么想。大家撺掇那个可怜的索斯伯里老汉找他算账，老汉就照他们说的风风火火跑了去。古德森把老汉上上下下打量了一遍，好像要在索斯伯里身上找出一块自己特别瞧不起的地方，然后说：‘这么说，你是调查组的，是吗？’索斯伯里说：差不离吧。‘哦。依你说，他们是想仔仔细细地问呢，还是听点儿简单的就行了呢？’‘古德森先生，要是他们想仔仔细细地问，我就再来一趟；我先听简单的吧。’‘那太好了，你就让他们全都见他妈的鬼去——我觉得这够简单的了。索斯伯里，我再劝你几句；你再来仔仔细细打听的时候，带个篮子来，把你那几根老骨头提回家去。’”</p> 
<p>“古德森就是这样；一点都没走样。他老是觉得他的主意比谁都强：他就这点虚荣心。”</p> 
<p>“玛丽，这一来就万事大吉，把咱们给救了。那件事再也不会有人提了。”</p> 
<p>“老天有眼，我想也不会有人提了。”</p> 
<p>他们又兴致勃勃地把话头引回那袋神秘的金子上来。过了一会儿，他们的谈话开始有了停顿——因为沉思而停顿。停顿的次数越来越多。最后理查兹竟然想呆了。他坐了半天，神情茫然地盯着地板，慢慢地，他的两只手开始做一些神经质的小动作，圈点着心里的念头，好像是有点儿着急。这时候，他妻子也犯了老毛病，一声不吭地想心事，从神态看得出她心乱如麻，不大自在。最后，理查兹站了起来，漫无目标地在房间里溜达，十个手指头在头发里蓖过来，蓖过去，就像一个梦游的人正做一个噩梦。后来，他好像是拿定了主意；一声不响地戴上帽子，大步流星地出门去了。他妻子还在皱着眉头想心事，好像没有发觉屋里只剩下她一个人了。她不时喃喃自语：可别把我们引到……可是——可是——我们真是太穷了，太穷了！……，可别把我们引到……啊，这碍别人的事吗？——再说谁也不会知道……可别把我们……”她的声音越来越小，后来只剩下嘴唇动弹。稍停，她抬头扫了一眼，半惊半喜地说——</p> 
<p>“他去了！可是，天哪，也许太晚了——来不及了……也许还不晚——也许还来得及。”她起身站着想，神经质地一会儿把两手绞在一起，一会儿又松开。一阵轻微的颤栗掠过全身，她从干哑的嗓子挤出了声音：“上帝饶恕我吧——这念头真可怕呀——可是……上帝呀，看我们成什么样子啦——我们都变成怪物了！”</p> 
<p>她把灯光拧小一点，蹑手蹑脚地溜到那只口袋旁跪下，用手触摸着鼓鼓囊囊的边边角角，爱不释手；年迈昏花的老眼中闪出一丝贪婪的光。她有时像灵魂出窍；有时又有一半清醒，嘟嘟囔囔地说：“我们要是能等一等就好了！——啊，只要等那么一小会儿，别那么着急就好了！”</p> 
<p>这时候，考克斯也从办公室回到家里，把这件蹊跷事原原本本地告诉了自己的妻子，迫不及待地议论了一番之后，他们猜到了已故的古德森，认为全镇子的男人里头只有他才会慷慨解囊拿出二十块钱来，用这笔不小的数目去接济一个落难的外乡人。后来，他们的谈话停了下来，俩人默默无言地想起了心事。他们的神经越来越紧张，烦躁不安。最后妻子开口了，好像是自言自语：</p> 
<p>“除了理查兹两口子……还有咱们，谁也不知道这个秘密……没有别人了。”</p> 
<p>丈夫微微受到触动，从冥思苦想中解脱出来；他眼巴巴地瞪着脸色刷白的妻子；后来。他迟迟疑疑地站起身。偷偷地膜了一眼帽子，又瞟了一眼自己的妻子——这是无声的请示。考克斯太太三番两次欲言又止，后来她以手封喉，点头示意。很快，家里只剩下她一个人在那里自言自语了。</p> 
<p>这时，理查兹和考克斯脚步匆匆，穿过阒无人迹的街道，迎头走来。两人气喘吁吁地在印刷厂的楼梯口碰了面；夜色中，他们相互打量着对方的脸色。考克斯悄悄地问：</p> 
<p>“除了咱们，没人知道这件事吧？”</p> 
<p>悄悄地回答：</p> 
<p>“鬼都不知道——我担保，鬼都不知道！”</p> 
<p>“要是还来得及——”</p> 
<p>两个人上了楼梯；就在这时候，一个小伙子赶了上来，考克斯问道：</p> 
<p>“是你吗，约翰尼？”</p> 
<p>“是，先生。”</p> 
<p>“你先不用发早班邮件——什么邮件都别发；等着，到时候我告诉你。”</p> 
<p>“已经发走了，先生。”</p> 
<p>“发走了？”话音里包含着难以言传的失望。</p> 
<p>“是，先生。从今天起到布里克斯顿以远所有城镇的火车都改点了，先生——报纸要比往常早发二十分钟。我只好紧赶慢赶；要是再晚两分钟就——”</p> 
<p>俩人没听他说完，就掉过头去慢慢走开了。大约有十分钟，两个人都没有出声；后来考克斯气哼哼地说：</p> 
<p>“你究竟赶个什么劲呀，我真不明白。”</p> 
<p>毕恭毕敬地回答：</p> 
<p>“我现在明白了，你看，也不知道是怎么搞的，我老是不动脑子，想吃后悔药也来不及。不过下一次——”</p> 
<p>“下一次个屁！一千年也不会有下一次了。”</p> 
<p>这对朋友没道晚安就各奔东西；各自拖着两条腿走回家去，就像霜打了一样。回到家，他们的妻子都一跃而起，迫不及待地问“怎么样？”——她们用眼睛就得出了答案，不等听一字半句，自己先垂头丧气一屁股坐了下去。两家都发生了激烈的争论——这可是新鲜事；从前两口子也拌嘴，可是都不激烈，也没有撕破过脸面。今天夜里两家的口角就好像是一个师傅教出来的。理查兹太太说：</p> 
<p>“爱德华，要是你等一等——要是你停下来琢磨琢磨呢；可是你不，你非要直奔报馆的印刷厂，把这件事嚷嚷出去，让天下的人都知道。”</p> 
<p>“那上面是说了要发表呀。”</p> 
<p>“说了又怎么样；那上面还说可以私访呢，只要你愿意才算数。现在可好——我没说错吧？”</p> 
<p>“嗨，没错——没错，真是那么说的；不过，我一想这件事会闹得沸沸扬扬，一想到一个外乡人这么信得过哈德莱堡，这是多大的脸面——”</p> 
<p>“啊，当然啦，这些我都明白；可是只要你等一等，仔细想想，不就能想起来已经找不到应该得这笔钱的人了吗。他已经进了棺材，也没有留下一男半女，连亲戚也没有；这么一来，这笔钱要是归了哪个急等用钱的人，对谁都没有妨碍呀，再说——再说——”</p> 
<p>她说不下去，哭了起来。她丈夫本来是想找几句宽心话，可脱口而出的却是这么几句：</p> 
<p>“可是，玛丽，别管怎么说，这样做肯定是最好的办法——肯定是；咱们心里有数。再说，咱们别忘了，这也是命啊——”</p> 
<p>“命！嗬，一个人要是于了蠢事想找个借口，就说‘什么都是命啊！’要说命，这笔钱特地来到咱们家，不也是命吗？老天爷已经安排好的事，你非要插一杠子——谁给你这种权力啦？这叫瞎折腾，就是这么回事——敬酒不吃吃罚酒，你就别再装老实人、装规矩人啦——”</p> 
<p>“可是，玛丽，你也知道咱们从小到大受的是什么教育，把咱们教的只要是老实事，想也不想就马上去做，全镇子上的人都是这样，这都变成咱们的第二天性——”</p> 
<p>“噢，我知道，我知道——没完没了的教育、教育、教育，教人要诚实——从摇篮里就开始教，拿诚实当挡箭牌，抵制一切诱惑，所以这诚实全是假的，诱惑一来，就全都泡汤了，今天晚上咱们可都看见了。老天在上，我对自己这种僵成了石头、想打都打不烂的诚实从来没有一丝一毫的怀疑，直到今天——今天，第一次真正的大诱惑一来，我就——爱德华，我相信全镇子的诚实都变味了，就像我一样；也像你一样，都变味了。这个镇子卑鄙，冷酷、吝啬，除了吹牛、摆架子的诚实，这个镇子连一点儿德行都没有了；我敢发誓，我确实相信，有朝一日这份诚实在要命的诱惑脚底下栽了跟头，它的鼎鼎大名会像纸糊的房子一样变成碎片。好，这一回我可是彻底坦白了，心里也好受了。我是个骗子，活了一辈子，骗了一辈子，自己还不知道。以后谁也别再说我诚实——我可受不了。”</p> 
<p>“我——哎，玛丽，我心里想的和你一模一样，我真是这么想的。这好像有点怪，太怪了。过去我从来不敢相信会是这样——从来不信。”</p> 
<p>随后是一阵长时间的沉默；夫妻俩都陷入了沉思。最后妻子抬起头来说：</p> 
<p>“我知道你在想什么，爱德华。”</p> 
<p>理查兹一脸被人抓住了把柄的窘态。</p> 
<p>“如实说出来真没脸见人，玛丽，可是——”</p> 
<p>“没事，爱德华，我现在跟你想到一起去了。”</p> 
<p>“我真盼着能想到一起去。你说吧。”</p> 
<p>“你想的是，如果有人猜得出古德森对那个外乡人说过什么话就好了。”</p> 
<p>“一点没错。我觉得这是罪过，没脸见人。你呢？”</p> 
<p>“我是过来人了。咱们在这儿搭个床吧；咱们得好好守着，守到明天早上银行金库开门，收了这只口袋……天哪，天哪——咱们要是没走错那步棋，该有多好！”</p> 
<p>搭好了床，玛丽说：</p> 
<p>“芝麻开门——那句话到底是怎么说的？我真想知道那句话是怎么说的？好吧，来；咱们该上床了。”</p> 
<p>“睡觉？”</p> 
<p>“不；想。”</p> 
<p>“好吧，想。”</p> 
<p>这时候，考克斯夫妇也打完了嘴仗，言归于好，他们上了床——想来想去，辗转反侧，烦躁不安，思量古德森究竟对那个走投无路的流浪汉说了一句什么话；那真是金口玉言哪，一句话就值四万块，还是现款。</p> 
<p>镇子上的电报所那天晚上关门比平日晚，原因如下：考克斯报馆里的编辑主任是美联社的地方通讯员。他这个通讯员简直是挂名的，因为他一年发的稿子被社里采用超不过四次，多不过三十个字。可这一次不同。他把捕捉到的线索电告之后，马上就接到了回电：</p> 
<p>将原委报来——点滴勿漏——一千二百字。</p> 
<p>约的是一篇大稿子呀！编辑主任如约交了稿；于是，他成了全美国最风光的人。第二天吃早饭的时候，所有的美国人都在念叨“拒腐蚀的哈德莱堡”，从蒙特利尔到墨西哥湾，从阿拉斯加的冰天雪地到佛罗里达的柑桔园；千百万人都在谈论那个外乡人和他的钱袋子，都操心能不能找到那位应得这笔钱的人，都盼着快快看到这件事的后续报道——越快越好。</p>
