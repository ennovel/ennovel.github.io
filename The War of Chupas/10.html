<br> 
<br> IT is my well-used custom to praise the good deeds of the captains and people of my nation, but also not to pardon their evil deeds. How much affection soever I may feel for some of them, it may be believed that I shall not fail to blame their errors. I saw this conquest and war and was present at it, and I shared in the love which all felt for Robledo: the more so because I used to go to his house at that time. And I speak the purest truth, though many things also happened which I do not mention, because I am so tired and bored with treating of the provinces to the westward. Although, as I say, I care so much for the honour of Robledo, I shall not hesitate to affirm that there was committed, in this province of Pozo, one of the greatest acts of cruelty that have been perpetrated in these Indies. This was that, because the unlucky natives wounded Robledo, the Spaniards felt such hatred towards them that[25] those who went to inflict punishment resolved to kill them all.
<br> 
<br> At the time when they were defeated on the first hill, their principal Chief, much disturbed at such a calamity, retreated to the banks of the great river, with his women and principal followers, while others of his captains went to form a garrison on the summit of a very inaccessible rock, which rose from the crest of one of the hills. Here a thousand persons were collected, men and women with many children, boys and girls, and a supply of provisions. The Christians, who came with the Comendador, sent the news of how they had beleaguered those people in their fort, and they marched towards it. When they were near, those of Pozo wished to defend themselves, but they were astonished and dismayed at so many coming against them. Our friendly Indians, from below, encircled the rock, and the Christians farther up sent forward the dogs, which were so fierce that in two bites with their cruel teeth they laid open their victims to the entrails. It was no small grief to see that, for taking up arms to defend their country against those who came to deprive them of it, they were treated in that manner. The little children, terrified at the noise and confusion, running hither and thither, were torn to pieces by the dogs, a horrible sight to witness. The cross-bows also made holes through their bodies, through which their souls could depart, while they groaned and cried for help to their parents and their gods; or in fleeing from the Spaniards they threw themselves over the cliffs. Those fugitives who escaped from these perils fell into a worse danger, namely, into the power of the Indians of Carrapa and Picara, who treated them with even greater cruelty. For they spared none, neither ugly nor beautiful women, neither old nor young, killing all. They took the children by their feet, and dashed their heads against the rocks, and promptly, like dragons, ate them raw. They killed most[26] of the men they took, and the rest, with hands securely tied, they carried off. Baltasa de Ledesma and the Comendador acted here in such a manner that one must believe it was for this crime that they were killed in course of time at this same place, when they and the captain were eaten by these very Indians.
<br> 
<br> After this no people remained on the rock. More than three hundred of those who had been there were killed. The Comendador, with the other "Christians," returned to the camp. Our native friends made more than 200 loads of human flesh, and with it and their prisoners they also returned to their camp, eating the lungs and hearts raw, as they went, and entrails too. When they arrived at the buildings they sent to their villages large presents of this flesh, as well as many of the Indians they had kept alive. Those who remained were forced to bend their heads and were killed by blows on the occiput with cudgels. And the only reproach they got from us was to be laughed at and asked whether that food tasted good to them. I saw that they brought more than twenty pots as big as our large earthen jars, and filled them all with this human flesh, which they devoured among them, sending the heads to their villages. A time came, when God permitting, the Pozos did more damage than this to their enemies, as we shall relate farther on.
<br> 
<br> When the news of the great injury the Christians had done spread to all parts of the province of Pozo, the people were astounded and afraid, and, that there might not be such a sad day again, the Chiefs determined to send to the captain and ask for peace. This was done. They came to the camp with presents of gold ornaments, and were well received by the captain, who promised them peace, provided the principal Chiefs came in, and rendered obedience to his Majesty. After some negotiation they did so, and after begging pardon for having taken up arms[27] they asked the captain that no more harm might be done to them. The captain agreed, the Indians of Carrapa and Picara returning to their own countries. When the captain's wounds were healed, he arranged to depart from Pozo, and they brought him many Indians to carry the baggage of the Spaniards. And so, leaving all in peace, we departed from Pozo.
