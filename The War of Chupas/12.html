<br> 
<br> HAVING gained the summit, the Spaniards continued to follow the Indians, killing some of them, and we saw that they were adorned with very beautiful ornaments of gold. They also had plumes of feathers, crowns, and[30] large plaques, and some were seen who were in armour of gold from head to foot. It was certainly beautiful to see some of the pieces they took, and from this the range was called La Loma de los Armados. We lodged in two of the houses there, very happy at finding that God our Lord had presented us with so rich and populous a land, in order that, being by us discovered, His name might be worshipped and the Holy Gospel preached.
<br> 
<br> On the following day we departed thence, and saw that the province was very large, full of villages, planted with maize and great rushes, and that there were groves of fruit trees, and palms yielding pixibays. The villages on the slopes and higher ground contained circular houses so large that there was room for fifteen or twenty people in each. There are many other things to tell of this province, which I have written in my Book of Foundations, where the reader will have seen them.
<br> 
<br> When we were passing out of a valley we heard a still greater noise at the top of the next range of hills, whither the road that we were taking led; and, marching more quickly, we came to the beginning of the rise, and saw that the pass was difficult before reaching the summit, for, besides presenting a steep ascent there were some rocks and gullies which would make it necessary for the horses to go gently, without attempting to press quickly forward. The captain demanded peace from the natives, and obedience to the Emperor; if this was refused he would make ruthless war. The Indians, deriding these demands, replied to us that we came to conquer and to rob what did not belong to us, that we should return to our own country, and leave them quiet and at peace in theirs. Having said these words and others, they shot off many darts and stones, showing that they intended to defend the approach to their village.
<br> 
<br> The captain seeing that the barbarians intended to[31] defend the pass, and that the noon-day heat was coming on, ordered the foot soldiers to lose no time in attacking the Indians with shields, cross-bows and dogs, in order to take the pass, so that the horses might be able to come up. In this they were successful, while some of the horsemen, laboriously seeking a way by one or other side of the mountain in spite of the Indians, found a place by which they were able to come up with the horses, to the position reached by the men on foot. Then the shouting was greater, for the Indians did not dare to await the coming of men who they saw were so valiant; and not caring to hear the neighing of the horses, turned their backs and began to run away, abandoning their arms—the cowards. The mounted men followed and overtook some of them, taking a quantity of gold in ornaments such as I have said they have. All the Spaniards who were behind having come up, we proceeded to encamp on the summit, which they called de los Cavallos. Here they found but little maize, as it was only in leaf.
<br> 
<br> The Chiefs and principal people of those villages, astounded at seeing the majesty of the Spaniards and their great power, and fearing to oppose them more, agreed to go to the captain peaceably. So they came to our camp with nets full of ornaments of the finest gold, asking the captain for pardon for having been so mad as not to have laid down their arms sooner. The captain received them very well and agreed to the peace. As the inhabitants of those villages were so rich they made presents of gold to the Spaniards. When they brought water for the horses, they offered very large and fine golden ornaments, so fine that they exceeded 21 carats. That night the captain sent the Comendador Hernán Rodríguez de Sosa, with a sufficient force to the village of one Maytama, who was the principal Chief of the province, to capture him or oblige him to render obedience to his Majesty. The Comendador started during the first night watch and marched until he arrived at[32] Maytama's hill. He found the Indians ready for war, and, attacking them until daylight, he put them to flight, captured a brother of Maytama, and saw them, both men and women, take away many loads of gold. The Spaniards could only capture a few because the thickness of the maize in the fields was so great. For this reason the Indians escaped with most of the gold, which if it had been taken would have been a great booty, nevertheless the Spaniards and their servants took some.
<br> 
<br> The captain, with the whole camp, arrived the next day. As it was known throughout the province that the Spaniards occupied the buildings of Maytama the natives sent messengers proposing to be friends and offering great presents of gold. The gold was brought in this way: the Indians came with much shouting, bearing long poles from the shoulder of one to that of another, from which there hung by cords the plaques, crowns, bracelets, and plumes of gold. On arriving where the captain was, they set them down before him, and thus the presents I have mentioned came from all parts of the province. The Chief, who was a prisoner, sent an old woman to bring gold, and next day she brought about 2,000 pesos, at which we were astonished. The Chief said that he had more gold buried and that he wanted to go and fetch it. He asked the captain to tell off some Spaniards to go with him, intending to escape if it were possible. The captain ordered some soldiers to go with him. When they came to some precipitous rocks, hating to remain in the power of the Spaniards, he determined to kill himself. With a barbarous and heathen mind, he hurled himself down over the precipice and left his brains among the stones, so that when the Spaniards reached the place, the Chief's soul was already in hell. The Spaniards returned to the captain and explained to him the manner of the captive Chief's death. Principal natives came to the camp each day with presents of gold, and the captain[33] came to the conclusion that he had arrived at a good place for founding a city. He determined to send the Comendador Hernán Rodríguez de Sosa to explore the region lower down the great river, and to remain there. He set out with forty Spaniards, horse and foot. The Comendador came to a large village which he called Pascua because he passed Easter there; continuing his advance he came to another village, where he met with some resistance. Leaving it, and taking a northerly course, he discovered the village of Cenufara and a place they called the Hill of Maize. Advancing further he arrived at a village called Pobres, whence he returned to the region of Arma, because he learnt, from statements he received, that there were no other settlements for a great distance.
<br> 
<br> At this time the inhabitants of the province of Arma conceived such hatred for the Spaniards that they determined to make war in common against us. This appeared from their not coming to our camp as usual, nor supplying us with provisions; while they killed our Indian servants and negroes who fell into their hands. The captain got notice of this league and conspiracy, and ordered his men to be on their guard against any sudden attack on the camp by Indians. But when they were all determined to rise against us, they failed to come to the point, owing to some disputes among themselves, and we saw them fall back well supplied with gold ornaments. When the Comendador returned, the captain resolved to quit the province, and departed, leaving it as hostile towards us as when we entered it. When we were about to depart, a number of Indians stationed themselves above our camp. The captain saw this and told the interpreters to call upon them in a friendly way to come down. They came, believing they were in no danger. The captain ordered all of those who came to be thrust inside the huts and issued orders to the Spaniards to give them wounds and cut off their hands.[34] In this way more than thirty were mutilated, as many more being killed. In that state the survivors were sent to their villages. Then the captain quitted the province of Arma. He intended to leave his ensign Suer de Nava there, to found a city; but, thinking it would be better to explore the province of Quinbaya, that plan was given up. Leaving Arma, and following the way by which he had come, the captain arrived at the province of Paucura, whence he departed for Pozo. There he seized several principal men and went to Carrapa, where he burnt one of them for some very trifling reason; and here we must leave him, because it is necessary to relate the manner in which the captains Pedro de A?asco and Juan de Ampudia met their deaths.
