<br> 
<br> WHEN the Indians had returned to their villages, as we related in the last chapter, they had great banquets and drinking orgies. It was agreed by them that if any Spaniards should come against them from Popayán and Timaná, they would kill them all, or do to them as they[39] had done to Pedro de A?asco. As soon as this was settled they made great trenches and walls for defence, cutting the hills where the roads led, and using haste to make arms.
<br> 
<br> When Serrano arrived at Popayán and told the captain Juan de Ampudia the fate of the Spaniards, he was much distressed and determined to make war on the murderers. He took from Popayán sixty Spaniards, horse and foot, as well armed as was possible, with what cross-bows there were, and very fierce dogs. He left Popayán and marched until he came to a province called Guanaca. Thence he approached the Yalcones, and arrived near Apirimá, the scene of the death of Osorio and his party. As soon as the Indians knew of his arrival, they stationed themselves on the heights, waiting in ambush to kill the invaders. Two of the Indians having shown themselves, however, the captain sent Antonio Redondo, a citizen of Cali, with ten Spaniards to try and capture them. But when Antonio reached the place where they had been seen, a great force of the enemy burst into view and attacked his ten men, so that the Spaniards turned and fled, not stopping until they got to where the captain had halted. The Indians overtook one, named Paredes, and killed him. When Juan de Ampudia saw this, he came to the rescue with the rest of his force and attacked the Indians in such sort that they impaled many with their lances, while the Spaniards on foot killed even more with swords and cross-bows. The killed were so numerous that a stream which ran down the ravine became the colour of blood.
<br> 
<br> The Indians, astounded at the turn of events, fled to escape from the dogs, which tore their flesh, and many threw themselves over the crags. The victory was with the Spaniards, and a Chief was captured. He told the captain Juan de Ampudia that the Indians were strongly entrenched and had cut the roads. The captain assured him of his life, and told him that he must guide them by a[40] safe track; and that for doing so he would be in no danger. The barbarian promised, and so they set out from that place with the captive Indian as a guide, wishing to reach the summit of the pass. The Indians had united from many parts, and all, with long lances, slings, and other arms, prepared to deal death to the Christians, assuming that they could do it very easily, and making a great yelling. The Spaniards continued to ascend the range, Captain Francisco García de Tovar, being in front with the infantry. Indians appeared in all directions and inquired of the Spaniards whether they were fat, as they were going to eat both them and their horses. Juan de Ampudia and Luis Bernal placed themselves on the height. Hernán Sánchez Morillo and others on horseback missed the track, but, though with much difficulty, they gained the summit, which had already been reached by those on foot. One and all then commended themselves to God, and calling on the apostle St. James to help them, attacked the Indians, being only the number I have stated against 4,000 Indians. After the battle had continued for a long time, the ground being covered with dead and wounded Indians—for only one Christian was killed and very few were wounded—the barbarians, amazed at the strength of the Spaniards, abandoned the field and began to flee. The Christians were so exhausted and fatigued that they could scarcely stand on their feet. There they passed the night. The Indians, joined by others from all parts, came near to the Spaniards' bivouac and, by the advice of some of the latter, the captain Tovar with forty shield and cross-bow men, went forth to attack those who were nearest. The Indians waited and attacked the Spaniards in front, giving a terrific shout. Those who are not accustomed to hear this clamour often lose their presence of mind, and commit very ugly faults. But Tovar and his companions fought well, killing and wounding many. The Indians said that all had to be eaten[41] that night. Showing his face and commanding person, Tovar exclaimed: "Dogs! I am Francisco García de Tovar, and with me and not with others have ye to do." Then, by the marvellous valour of this captain and the Spaniards his companions, they did such deeds that a great number of Indians were killed, the rest fled, and Tovar returned to the captain, who received him with welcome.
<br> 
<br> Soon afterwards Juan de Ampudia marched down the mountain side, with all the Spaniards, to some buildings, where they encamped. Francisco García de Tovar, with a guard, entered first and found that there were no Indians; because, when they escaped from him, they had fled to where the principal Chiefs of the Yalcones and of Páez were waiting to collect more Indians. They sent a message to the Christians, calling upon them to leave their country, for that, as their fathers had left it free they ought not to seek to usurp it nor to deprive them of their ancient liberty. If they refused, they would be treated like Pedro de A?asco and the other Spaniards who were killed. The captain replied that they must render obedience to his Majesty, and that then he would presently leave their province and return to Popayán. When these conferences were finished and the messengers had departed, the captain, seeing how much work the men had done, and how tired they all were, besides being very few to make war against so many Indians, especially such a daring pack, decided to return to Popayán, and to punish the province of Páez, which was also up in arms, on his way. So they got ready to depart. When about to start Francisco García de Tovar said to the captain, Ampudia, that it would be very desirable to gain the summit of the pass, to prevent the Indians from occupying it, lest they pelt them with their darts and stones. Juan de Ampudia concurred, and ordered all to be prepared, while some young men went on to gain the pass. As some of the Spaniards had stayed behind with[42] a horse that was knocked up, they were told to wait there and that, if they could not arrive while yet day, they were to sleep there that night. When it was late these Spaniards arrived with the horse cut up in pieces for eating. Juan de Ampudia told them to go to some declivities which were in front of where they were.
<br> 
<br> Francisco García de Tovar again urged that they should occupy the summit, for otherwise they would be in great danger; and he took the fact that they had not seen a single Indian that day to be a bad sign. When Francisco García de Tovar said this, the Spaniards were making their way towards the slopes and level spaces near there: but Juan de Ampudia saying "Let us go where I said, for it is only a short way off" they went on contrary to the advice of Tovar. They moved off in very great sadness, for neither did the men speak, nor the horses neigh, nor the dogs bark. As they marched thus they heard a great yelling of the Indians who, when they saw the route the Spaniards were taking, rejoiced because they felt sure they would kill and eat them all; having a great quantity of huge stones to roll down, which they had collected on the summit. As soon as the Spaniards had reached the declivities, the Indians began to hurl down so many and such large stones that the former, from fear of them, divided themselves into four or five parties. Then the Indians renewed their terrible yelling, hurled their darts, and asked if the Spaniards were nice and fat, for none of them would escape death. Juan de Ampudia and Tovar went together, telling Hernán Sánchez Morillo to go with the horses until he could get clear of the declivity. At this time the Indians came down to attack the Spaniards, who, though divided and in such small numbers, fought with a valour and desperation that can scarcely be believed. But God was with them and on their side, and this being so they performed such famous deeds as these[43] we relate, and others greater, as indeed they always do. After they had killed many Indians, they saw that the others were taking fright at what they had witnessed, and the horsemen, having got over a difficult pass, were in a position to join in the assault against the Indians and help their own companions.
<br> 
<br> Francisco García de Tovar received three wounds, and he and Juan de Ampudia had managed to keep together with sixteen other Spaniards. After having defeated the Indians who first came down, they set off to repel another large batch of them. Although the Spaniards fought as at first, and killed some of the enemy with cross-bows, yet the Indians were so numerous that by no manner of means could the foot-soldiers advance. They had to retreat and join the horsemen who were now nearing them. While they were doing this the captain Juan de Ampudia, being a fleshy man, could not keep up with the others. The Indians overtook him and pierced his body with many lances, so that he died in great misery. They stripped the body, without even leaving his linen drawers. Juan de Ampudia was a native of Jerez de la Frontera. Then the horsemen came up and inflicted great loss on the Indians. They gained the summit and called on the rest of the Spaniards to come up, as there was nothing to fear. All who had come with Juan de Ampudia were wounded or quite worn out, as the reader may easily imagine. With much trouble they all assembled on the heights, and greatly did they rejoice at seeing themselves there, embracing each other as if they had not met for many days. The only killed were Juan de Ampudia and one other Spaniard, besides a Morisca and a few friendly Indians of our party.
<br> 
<br> Then there was a fresh attack by more than twenty thousand Indian warriors, with the intention of killing all the Spaniards and finishing them. Seeing this state of affairs, after having cast the body of Juan de Ampudia into[44] a river, to prevent the Indians from eating it, they determined to return to Popayán. In order that the Indians might think they were still there, they left the tents standing and tied some of the dogs to poles, that the Indians, hearing them barking, might have no suspicion that their masters had gone. And so it was. They fled with such speed that they covered in that one night what it had taken them four days to do, in coming. Next day, though the Indians followed, they could not overtake them. And so they marched until they arrived at Popayán, where there was great grief for the death of the good and brave captain Juan de Ampudia.
