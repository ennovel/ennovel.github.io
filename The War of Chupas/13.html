<br> 
<br> LET the reader's attention be now turned to the exploration of the province of Bogotá by the Spaniards coming from Santa Marta, which we mentioned in the first book of The War of Las Salinas, and to what happened between them and the captain Belalcazar. I also related how the captain A?asco founded the town of Timaná, where, after coming from Cali when Lorenzo de Aldana was General of those cities on behalf of the Marquis Pizarro, he was confirmed in his charge, and returned as lieutenant to the said town of Timaná. The captain Juan de Ampudia was lieutenant in Popayán, Miguel Mu?oz in Cali, and Lorenzo de Aldana had gone to Quito, as we have already stated. While this region was under these lieutenants, glowing accounts reached them of the wonderful richness[35] of the new kingdom,[24] the quantity of gold and emeralds there, and the high value of commodities; so that there was a desire to take thither all the merchandize and flocks that could be collected. A merchant who was at Popayán, named Pero López del Infierno,[25] Captain Osorio (a relation of Juan de Ampudia) and others, agreed to leave Popayán for the new kingdom with merchandize, horses, mares, slaves, and much worked silver. With these goods, which amounted to a great money value, they left Popayán and set out on the road for Bogotá, without distrusting the Indians, because, as it was peace time, they had no fear of hostilities with them. They went on until they arrived in the country of the Yalcones, which borders on that of Páez. At this time the captain Pedro de A?asco had left Timaná to go to Popayán, to trade for horses and other things he required. He came to the country of the Yalcones, which is where I have said Osorio had arrived. The natives of that region are numerous and determined. They fight with lances 30 palmos long, and have other formidable weapons. They resolved to rebel against the Spaniards, and not merely to refuse obedience, but to kill the captain and the others who had come from Popayán, As they had notice of the numerous horses, mares, and other things the Spaniards brought, they desired to put their thought into execution to satiate their cursed bellies with human flesh, and to rob what we have said. They took up arms with this intent, and planned that one party should attack the captain Pedro de A?asco, while another fell upon the Christians who had come from Popayán, for they feared that if they did not adopt this division of force, their plan might not succeed. The Indians were upon all the hills, but they repaired with feigned friendliness to the ravine of Apirimá (which is the locality where Osorio was) to put the Spaniards off their guard.
<br> 
<br> [36]
<br> 
<br> At this time the captain Pedro de A?asco had arrived at a valley called Ayunga. When the Indians formed the intention already stated, it came to the knowledge of a friendly Chief who was with A?asco. This Chief told A?asco of the league formed by the Yalcones, those of Páez, and other neighbouring tribes, and that, as he had only two horses, he had better go back. The captain made light of what the Chief had told him, showing that he thought little of it, and he continued on until he came to a building, late in the day, where two Indians appeared. One brought a young lion, dead and putrid, for the captain to eat, the other brought some cobs of young maize. The captain, seeing the presents, knew what they signified, and the Indians, dissembling, said that presently, the next day, they would bring those who would eat the captain and his Christians. The friendly Chief then spoke to Pedro de A?asco urging him to return into the forest, which was not far from there, and he would be safe from the Indians. But he would not go back because he did not believe that the audacity of the barbarians could reach to such a point. He ordered all his men to be ready with their arms, and that some of them should keep watch on the roads leading to the buildings where they were encamped, which was done. The Indians had gathered in a great mass and, before dawn, they attacked the Spanish sentries with a violent clamour. Although the sentries behaved as Spaniards always do, they were overpowered, killed, cut in pieces, and carried away to be eaten. The captain, Pedro de A?asco, hearing the noise, commended himself to God, and mounted his horse. With his companions he then awaited the Indians' onslaught, his men animating each other. A?asco was a well-grown man of fine presence, one of the principal knights of Seville; but for his sins, or by God's permission, he came at last to a most cruel and unworthy death, for such a warrior.
<br> 
<br> The Indians, in much confusion, had already rushed upon[37] the Spaniards, when the captain, and Baltasar del Rio charged them with their horses. Though the Spaniards showed great determination, they could not prevail against such a bevy of lances as faced their horses; nevertheless Pedro de A?asco broke into them, while the other horseman was killed. The captain, whose horse came out wounded and bridleless, turned again to attack the enemy with his blood-covered lance, but they fell upon him in such numbers that, after having killed the horse, they captured him alive. The rest of the Spaniards were all either killed or frightfully wounded, some of them having their bodies so full of lances that nothing could be seen but the wooden staves. Others fell wounded and were promptly despatched. Others had their eyes or their tongues torn out, or were impaled. Two Spaniards, one named Cornejo and the other Mideros, resisted so valiantly that, after having fought against the multitude of savages, they sallied forth from that place in spite of them all, and, with their swiftness of foot, ran off in the direction of Timaná. For four days they wandered without food except some wild herbs, pursued by the Indians, suffering other great hardships and many times surrounded, until by God's pleasure they got free and made for Timaná, where the death of Pedro de A?asco had already been rumoured, and Pedro de Guzmán de Herrera had gone forth with three horsemen to find out whether it was true. One night, when the party were asleep, the Indians attacked them. They mounted their horses in great haste. Pedro de Guzmán was getting on his, but as they did not leave him time to cast off the halter, and the horse was unable to start, he was killed with many lance wounds. The other Spaniards, though in great danger, escaped to Timaná.
<br> 
<br> Captain Osorio was, as we have said, in the ravine of Apirimá with those who had come with him, numbering sixteen Spaniards. From his camp to where A?asco's people were massacred, was not more than two leagues.[38] Just as they were about to resume their journey, the great mass of Indians rushed upon them, after having eaten the bodies of all the Spaniards they had killed, and robbed all the baggage. They had taken the captain Pedro de A?asco alive. He was sent all through the province, that he might be seen in the market places and villages, where the people heaped insults upon the unhappy captain and made his body suffer a thousand martyrdoms. They killed him by a lingering and cruel death. On one day they cut off an arm, on another they tore out an eye, on the next they cut off his lips, and so they continued to consume the being that had been a man, until life was ended, when the body found sepulture in the bellies of his murderers.
<br> 
<br> The savages, having next arrived at Apirimá, where the Christians who had gone to Popayán were encamped, encircled them, and then, with great clamour, attacked them suddenly and began to wound them. Although the Spaniards attempted a defence they could not prevail. Only one escaped, a Spaniard whose name was Serrano. All the rest were killed and eaten by the Indians, who also captured the merchandize and other things which were intended for sale at Bogotá. After they had killed the Spaniards and seized all their property the Indians returned to their villages very pleased with themselves.
