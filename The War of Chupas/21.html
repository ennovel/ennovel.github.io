<br> 
<br> GONZALO Pizarro was much distressed at finding that he could not reach any fertile and abundant province, beyond such rough country as he had met with. He deplored, many times, that he had undertaken this ex[62]pedition. If he wanted to explore he might have done so from Cuzco with better information, or from further south. But he did not let his followers understand this. On the contrary he gave them all possible encouragement, and it was the advice of all that they should return towards the place whence they had started. On that same day they set out, and returned towards Zumaque, stopping short at a distance of four leagues from the camp. Gonzalo would not go into it, but ordered his party to go direct to the village of Ampua. Before reaching there they came to a great river which they could not ford.[39] The Indians had canoes, and seeing some on the banks of the river, the Spaniards called out saying that they came as friends, and that the Indians need have no fear whatever. Their Chief, whose name was Delicola, determined to go himself and see what manner of men had invaded his country. So he came over, attended by fifteen or twenty men. When Gonzalo Pizarro saw him, and knew that he was the lord of that river where they were, he rejoiced and received him with much honour, giving him some combs and knives, which they value highly. He asked the Chief whether they knew of any land that was good, and to which the Spaniards could go. Meanwhile the Chief had repented that he had come as a friend, for he now got word of the many Indians put to death by the Spaniards, because they had not given the pleasing news the latter wished. So the Chief determined, though it was a lie, to tell them that there were very great populations further on and very rich regions full of powerful lords. Gonzalo Pizarro and his followers were delighted to hear this, believing it to be all truth. Gonzalo Pizarro ordered that the Spaniards were to watch this native Chief without his knowing it, and look out for him in such a way as that it would be impossible for him to escape. This was done, but the Chief, guessing quite well[63] that he was watched, dissembled and did not show any anxiety. As the river was wide in that part and the canoes were not there, they went on to see whether what this Indian had told them was true or not, until they reached a place where the river became narrow. Here they made a bridge and crossed over by it.
<br> 
<br> The wild mountaineers, when they knew of the Spaniards being in that country, called many of their people together and, taking up arms, collected on the other side of the river, where they dug trenches and made forts to defend themselves. When Gonzalo Pizarro saw that, he ordered some arquebusiers who were with him to fire off their arquebuses and try to kill some of the natives. They did so, killing six or seven Indians, whereupon the others, seeing the sudden deaths of their companions, began to take to flight with loud yells. Having crossed the river, the Spaniards came to a place where there were no mountains, but low-lying plains, though presently these were seen to be everywhere surrounded by forest. They found few natives and only a small amount of provisions, all the Indians being of one appearance and dress. So Gonzalo Pizarro decided to call up the rest of the Spaniards, who were at Zumaque in the camp that was formed there. Two Spaniards were sent for them and, on their arrival at Zumaque, Don Antonio and the captain Orellana came to join Gonzalo Pizarro at the place whence he had sent the message. When the whole expedition was united, Gonzalo ordered the Camp-master, Don Antonio de Rivera, to advance with some men, and find out what the country looked like further on. Don Antonio set out with fifty Spaniards and marched until he had covered about twenty leagues of upland. Then they came upon a small settlement called Barco, and found some provisions. He reported this to Gonzalo Pizarro who proceeded thither with his whole force, the Chief meeting them in a friendly manner, and telling them what was[64] ahead. The natives were much alarmed at seeing the horses and so many Spaniards. The Chief wanted to plunge into the river and take to flight, but Sancho de Caravajal perceiving this, seized him and brought him before Gonzalo Pizarro, who ordered him to be fastened to a chain, with two other Chiefs who had come as friends. The Chief who, we said, first gave them news of rich provinces was carefully watched, but was not made a prisoner at that time. When the Indians saw that their Chiefs who had come as friends had been put in chains they were indignant, and, taking up arms, they came in forty canoes direct to the place where they had seen their Chief who called to them to protect him. But the Spaniards who saw the canoes coming and heard the shouting, came out with their arms and put the Indians to rout. Then Gonzalo Pizarro ordered Delicola, the Chief who had been a party to raising the natives in arms against him and his followers, to be made fast on the chain with the others.
<br> 
<br> The Spaniards, seeing that the river they had discovered was very large and must flow down to the Sweet Sea,[40] and reflecting that of all the servants they had brought from Quito not one remained, nor could any be found where they were, the land being so bad, came to the conclusion that the best plan would be to build a craft, on board of which their supplies might go down the river, the horses following by land, in the hope of reaching some region of plenty, for which they all besought Our Lord. Presently they built the vessel with the necessary outfit they had brought with them, and one Juan Alcántara was given charge of her. They shipped as much stuff as she could stow, and the Spaniards with the horses followed down stream, along the bank. They met with some small settlements where they got maize and yuca, and they found a quantity of[65] guavas which afforded no small help to them in their need. Continuing their journey down the river bank, they sometimes wished to diverge in one direction or another to see what the country was like, but the morasses and other obstacles were so great that they could not, and so they were obliged to keep along the river bank, though with much difficulty, for the creeks in the swamps were so deep that swimming the horses through them was an arduous task. Some Spaniards and horses were drowned. The Indian men and women carrying loads could not cross these swamps on foot, so they looked for some of the canoes which the natives had hidden. When the bad places were narrow they made bridges of trees, and crossed in that manner. In this way they advanced down the river for forty-three marches, and there was not a day when they did not come upon one or two of these creeks, so deep that they were put to the labour we have described, each time. They found little food and no inhabitants, and they began to feel the pangs of hunger, for of the herd of swine they brought from Quito, numbering more than 5,000, all were eaten. At this time the Chief Delicola, who was the first that came in friendly guise, and the other prisoners, for fear the Spaniards would kill them, declared that farther on they would find a rich and well-peopled land. Observing one day that they were less carefully watched, they slipped into the river with their chain, and crossed to the other side, without the Spaniards being able to retake them. The Spaniards thus found themselves without guides for advancing, and they consulted as to what it would be best to do. As the Indians had said that after fifteen marches they would come to another very broad and swift river, down which there were large settlements and very rich Chiefs, also such quantities of food that if there were a thousand Spaniards there would be enough for all, Gonzalo Pizarro ordered the Captain-General Francisco de[66] Orellana, with seventy men, to go on and see if what the Indians had said was true, and to return with the vessel full of provisions, for they saw the great need there was for food. He himself, with the rest of his force, would march down stream at once, to reach the populous country as soon as possible. For all the Spaniards were in want, and in truth their necessity was dire, so that Orellana must make all speed to bring them relief. He was not to do anything else; wherefore the vessel was entrusted to his care solely, and to no other person. Francisco de Orellana replied that he would use all possible diligence to carry out his orders, that he would bring back provisions as quickly as he could, and that there need be no doubt about that. So he took on board some arms and clothing belonging to Gonzalo Pizarro and others who wished to send them on, and then departed down the river, leaving Gonzalo Pizarro and the other Spaniards longing for his quick return.
