It is an extraordinarily strange case.”
<br> 
<br> “It seems clear enough.”
<br> 
<br> “Not to me, sir—excuse me for saying so.”
<br> 
<br> The Chief of the Criminal Investigation Department had long had his eye on Freyberger. He recognized genius in the man. He knew his temperament also, and that, if given a full rein and let speak and act as he liked he blossomed; but, if snubbed or kept in check he wilted, and became just an ordinary detective.
<br> 
<br> “Just explain yourself,” he said. “Give me the points in your mind that strike you.”
<br> 
<br> “Well, sir,” said the other, “why did this man leave those utterly damning letters behind him on the mantelpiece?”
<br> 
<br> “You know as well as I do,” replied the Chief, “that in every criminal’s brain there is a black spot, a vacant point that betrays him, and leads him to do some act, some extraordinarily stupid act, which in turn leads him—here.”
<br> 
<br> “Quite so. Why did he cut off his victim’s head—what in the name of heaven did he want to burden himself with a human head for? The man was known in the neighbourhood, his body was there to be identified; taking the head away would seem to serve no known purpose, unless he intended to keep it as a curiosity or memento.”
<br> 
<br> “I confess it puzzles me,” replied the other.
<br> 
<br> “On top of these two puzzling facts,” went on Freyberger, “we have the death of Leloir the valet.”
<br> 
<br> “He may have opened the bag and come upon the head.”
<br> 
<br> “I have thought of that, but the explanation does not satisfy me, for, from the expression of his face—” Freyberger stopped.
<br> 
<br> “Yes?”
<br> 
<br> “Well, I am convinced he saw something worse than an ordinary human head.”
<br> 
<br> “Remember that to open a bag and find a grizzly thing like that would give even the most stout-hearted man a shock.”
<br> 
<br> Freyberger shook his head. “There was a look of wild horror on his face that was caused, by what I know not, by what I even fail to imagine, but by something, I am very sure, much worse than the sight of a human head. I can almost fancy—”
<br> 
<br> “Well?”
<br> 
<br> Freyberger gave a little laugh, as if at the idea that had struck him. “I can almost fancy a man dying with an expression on his face like that after he had seen the—unimaginable. Excuse me, I am a German by birth, and we Germans have wild thoughts sometimes. Let me be practical. With your permission I will telephone now to Coutts’s, they are Sir Anthony’s bankers; it may be as well to see if they have any knowledge of his movements.”
<br> 
<br> “Use the telephone,” replied the Chief.
<br> 
<br> Freyberger went to the instrument, spoke through it, received an answer, and spoke again. Then he listened attentively, and as he listened a faint smile stole over his face.
<br> 
<br> “He has been there at ten o’clock this morning, just as they opened, taken the box containing his late wife’s jewels, given a receipt for it, and departed. He evidently determined to collect all his resources. He has done it with great coolness. No professional criminal could have done it better.”
<br> 
<br> “You must remember he was a financier,” said the other.
<br> 
<br> “True,” replied Freyberger, “and now, if you will permit me, sir, I will go about the business of finding the cabman who drove him this morning, or last night. He is pretty certain—” He stopped, for at that moment a knock came to the door and a sergeant appeared.
<br> 
<br> “Telephone from Vine Street, sir, relative to 110B Piccadilly. A dismembered human head has been discovered.”
<br> 
<br> “Ha!” said the chief. “Any details?”
<br> 
<br> “No, sir, only the statement.”
<br> 
<br> The Chief went to his private telephone and spoke through, “Messenger come with word, no details, go at once Freyberger and report.”
