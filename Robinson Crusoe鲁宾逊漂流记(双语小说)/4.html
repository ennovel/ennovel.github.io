I had Timber enough to have built a Fleet of Ships. I had Grapes enough to have made Wine, or to have cur'd into Raisins, to have loaded that Fleet, when they had been built. But all I could make use of, was, All that was valuable. I had enough to eat, and to supply my Wants, and, what was all the rest to me? If I kill'd more Flesh than I could eat, the Dog must eat it, or the Vermin. If I sow'd more Corn than I could eat, it must be spoil'd. The Trees that I cut down, were lying to rot on the Ground. I could make no more use of them than for Fewel; and that I had no Occasion for, but to dress my Food. 
<br> 
<br> In a Word, The Nature and Experience of Things dictated to me upon just Reflection, That all the good Things of this World, are no farther good to us, than they are for our Use; and that whatever we may heap up indeed to give others, we enjoy just as much as we can use, and no more. The most covetous griping Miser in the World would have been cur'd of the Vice of Covetousness, if he had been in my Case; for I possess'd infinitely more than I knew what to do with. I had no room for Desire, except it was of Things which I had not, and they were but Trifles, though indeed of great Use to me. I had, as I hinted before, a Parcel of Money, as well Gold as Silver, about thirty six Pounds Sterling: Alas! There the nasty sorry useless Stuff lay; I had no manner of Business for it; and I often thought with my self, That I would have given a Handful of it for a Gross of Tobacco-Pipes, or for a Hand-Mill to grind my Corn; nay, I would have given it all for Sixpenny-worth of Turnip and Carrot Seed out of England, or for a Handful of Pease and Beans, and a Bottle of Ink: As it was, I had not the least advantage by it, or Benefit from it; but there it lay in a Drawer, and grew mouldy with the Damp of the Cave, in the wet Season; and if I had had the Drawer full of Diamonds, it had been the same Case; and they had been of no manner of Value to me, because of no Use. 
<br> 
<br> I had now brought my State of Life to be much easier in it self than it was at first, and much easier to my Mind, as well as to my Body. I frequently sat down to my Meat with Thankfulness, and admir'd the Hand of God's Providence, which had thus spread my Table in the Wilderness. I learn'd to look more upon the bright Side of my Condition, and less upon the dark Side; and to consider what I enjoy'd, rather than what I wanted; and this gave me sometimes such secret Comforts, that I cannot express them; and which I take Notice of here, to put those discontented People in Mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what God has given them; because they see, and covet something that he has not given them: All our Discontents about what we want, appear'd to me, to spring from the Want of Thankfulness for what we have. 
<br> 
<br> Another Reflection was of great Use to me, and doubtless would be so to any one that should fall into such Distress as mine was; and this was, To compare my present Condition with what I at first expected it should be; nay, with what it would certainly have been, if the good Providence of God had not wonderfully order'd the Ship to be cast up nearer to the Shore, where I not only Could come at her, but could bring what I got out of her to the Shore, for my Relief and Comfort; without which, I had wanted for Tools to work, Weapons for Defence, or Gun-Powder and Shot for getting my Food. 
<br> 
<br> I spent whole Hours, I may say whole Days, in representing to my self in the most lively Colours, how I must have acted, if I had got nothing out of the Ship. How I could not have so much as got any Food, except Fish and Turtles; and that as it was long before I found any of them, I must have perish'd first. That I should have liv'd, if I had not perish'd, like a meer Savage. That if I had kill'd a Goat, or a Fowl, by any Contrivance, I had no way to flea' or open them, or part the Flesh from the Skin, and the Bowels, or to cut it up; but must gnaw it with my Teeth, and pull it with my Claws like a Beast. 
<br> 
<br> These Reflections made me very sensible of the Goodness of Providence to me, and very thankful for my present Condition, with all its Hardships and Misfortunes: And this Part also I cannot but recommend to the Reflection of those, who are apt in their Misery to say, Is any Affliction like mine! Let them consider, How much worse the Cases of some People are, and their Case might have been, if Providence had thought fit. 
<br> 
<br> I had another Reflection which assisted me also to comfort my Mind with Hopes; and this was, comparing my present Condition with what I had deserv'd, and had therefore Reason to expect from the Hand of Providence. I had liv'd a dreadful Life, perfectly destitute of the Knowledge and Fear of God. I had been well instructed by Father and Mother; neither had they been wanting to me, in their early Endeavours, to infuse a religious Awe of God into my Mind, a Sense of my Duty, and of what the Nature and End of my Being, requir'd of me. But alas! falling early into the Seafaring Life, which of all the Lives is the most destitute of the Fear of God, though his Terrors are always before them; I say, falling early into the Seafaring Life, and into Seafaring Company, all that little Sense of Religion which I had entertain'd, was laugh'd out of me by my Mess-Mates, by a harden'd despising of Dangers; and the Views of Death, which grew habitual to me; by my long Absence from all Manner of Opportunities to converse with any thing but what was like my self, or to hear any thing that was good, or tended towards it. 
<br> 
<br> So void was I of every Thing that was good, or of the least Sense of what I was, or was to be, that in the greatest Deliverances I enjoy'd, such as my Escape from Sallee; my being taken up by the Portuguese Master of the Ship; my being planted so well in the Brasils; my receiving the Cargo from England, and the like; I never had once the Word Thank God, so much as on my Mind, or in my Mouth; nor in the greatest Distress, had I so much as a Thought to pray to him, or so much as to say, Lord have Mercy upon me;no nor to mention the Name of God, unless it was to swear by, and blaspheme it. 
<br> 
<br> I had terrible Reflections upon my Mind for many Months, as I have already observ'd, on the Account of my wicked and hardned Life past; and when I look'd about me and considered what particular Providences had attended me since my coming into this Place, and how God had dealt bountifully with me; had not only punished me less than my Iniquity had deserv'd, but had so plentifully provided for me; this gave me great hopes that my Repentance was accepted, and that God had yet Mercy in store for me. 
<br> 
<br> With these Reflections I work'd my Mind up, not only to Resignation to the Will of God in the present Disposition of my Circumstances; but even to a sincere Thankfulness for my Condition, and that I who was yet a living Man, ought not to complain, seeing I had not the due Punishment of my Sins; that I enjoy'd so many Mercies which I had no reason to have expected in that Place; that I ought never more to repine at my Condition but to rejoyce, and to give daily Thanks for that daily Bread, which nothing but a Croud of Wonders could have brought. That I ought to consider I had been fed even by Miracle, even as great as that of feeding Elijah by Ravens; nay, by a long Series of Miracles, and that I could hardly have nam'd a Place in the unhabitable Part of the World where I could have been cast more to my Advantage: A Place, where as I had no Society, which was my Affliction on one Hand, so I found no ravenous Beast, no furious Wolves or Tygers to threaten my Life, no venomous Creatures or poisonous, which I might feed On to my Hurt, no Savages to murther and devour me. 
<br> 
<br> In a word, as my Life was a Life of Sorrow, one way, so it was a Life of Mercy, another; and I wanted nothing to make it a Life of Comfort, but to be able to make my Sence of God's Goodness to me, and Care over me in this Condition, be my daily Consolation; and after I did make a just Improvement of these things, I went away and was no more sad. 
<br> 
<br> I had now been here so long, that many Things which I brought on Shore for my Help, were either quite gone, or very much wasted' and near spent. 
<br> 
<br> My Ink, as I observed, had been gone some time, all but a very little, which I eek'd out with Water a little and a little, till it was so pale it scarce left any Appearance of black upon the Paper: As long as it lasted, I made use of it to minute down the Days of the Month on which any remarkable Thing happen'd to me, and first by casting up Times past: I remember that there was a strange Concurrence of Days, in the various Providences which befel me; and which, if I had been superstitiously inclin'd to observe Days as Fatal or Fortunate, I might have had Reason to have look'd upon with a great deal of Curiosity. 
<br> 
<br> First I had observed, that the same Day that I broke away from my Father and my Friends, and run away to Hull, in order to go to Sea; the same Day afterwards I was taken by the Sallee Man of War, and made a Slave. 
<br> 
<br> The same Day of the Year that I escaped out of the Wreck of that Ship in Yarmouth Rodes, that same Day-Year afterwards I made my escape from Sallee in the Boat. 
<br> 
<br> The same Day of the Year I was born on (viz.) the 30th of September, that same Day, I had my Life so miraculously saved 26 Year after, when I was cast on Shore in this Island, so that my wicked Life, and my solitary Life begun both on a Day. 
<br> 
<br> The next Thing to my Ink's being wasted, was that of my Bread, I mean the Bisket which I brought out of the Ship; this I had husbanded to the last degree, allowing my self but one Cake of Bread a Day for above a Year, and yet I was quite without Bread for near a Year before I got any Corn of my own, and great Reason I had to be thankful that I had any at all, the getting it being, as has been already observed, next to miraculous. 
<br> 
<br> My Cloaths began to decay too mightily: As to Linnen, I had had none a good while, except some chequer'd Shirts which I found in the Chests of the other Seamen, and which I carefully preserved, because many times I could bear no other Cloaths on but a Shirt; and it was a very great help to me that I had among all the Men's Cloaths Of the Ship almost three dozen Of Shirts. There were also several thick Watch Coats of the Seamens, which were left indeed, but they were too hot to wear; and tho' it is true, that the Weather was so violent hot, that there was no need of Cloaths, yet I could not go quite naked; no, tho' I had been inclin'd to it, which I was not, nor could not abide the thoughts of it, tho' I was all alone. 
<br> 
<br> The Reason why I could not go quite naked, was, I could not bear the heat of the Sun so well when quite naked, as with some Cloaths on; nay, the very Heat frequently blistered my Skin; whereas with a Shirt on, the Air itself made some Motion, and whistling under that Shirt was twofold cooler than without it; no more could I ever bring my self to go out in the heat of Sun, without a Cap or a Hat; the heat of the Sun beating with such Violence as it does in that Place, would give me the Head-ach presently, by darting so directly on my Head, without a Cap or Hat on, so that I could not bear it, whereas, if I put on my Hat, it would presently go away. 
<br> 
<br> Upon those Views I began to consider about putting the few Rags I had, which I call'd Cloaths, into some Order; I had worn out all the Wast-coats I had, and my Business was now to try if I could not make Jackets out of the great Watch-Coats which I had by me, and with such other Materials as I had, so I set to Work a Taylering, or rather indeed a Botching, for I made most piteous Work of it. However, I made shift to make two or three new Wastcoats, which I hoped wou'd serve me a great while; as for Breeches or Drawers, I made but a very sorry shift indeed, till afterward. 
<br> 
<br> I have mentioned that I saved the Skins of all the Creatures that I kill'd, I mean four-footed ones, and I had hung them up stretch'd out with Sticks in the Sun, by which means some of them were so dry and hard that they were fit for little but others it seems were very useful. The first thing I made of these was a great Cap for my Head, with the Hair on the out Side to shoor off the Rain; and this I perform'd so well, that after this I made me a Suit of Cloaths wholly of these Skins, that is to say, a Wastcoat, and Breeches open at Knees, and both loose, for they were rather wanting to keep me cool than to keep me warm. I must not omit to acknowledge that they were wretchedly made; for if I was a bad Carpenter, I was a worse Tayler. However, they were such as I made very good shift with; and when I was abroad, if it happen'd to rain, the Hair of my Wastcoat and Cap being outermost, I was kept very dry. 
<br> 
<br> After this I spent a great deal of Time and Pains to make me an Umbrella; I was indeed in great want of one, and had a great Mind to make one; I had seen them made in the Brasils, where they are very useful in the great Heats which are there. And I felt the Heats every jot as great here, and greater too, being nearer the Equinox; besides, as I was oblig'd to be much abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, as well for the Rains as the Heats. I took a world of Pains at it, and was a great while before I could make any thing likely to hold; nay, after I thought I had hit the Way, I spoil'd 2 or 3 before I made one to my Mind; but at last I made one that answer'd indifferently well: The main Difficulty I found was to make it to let down. I could make it to spread, but if it did not let down too, and draw in, it was not portable for me any Way but just over my Head, which wou'd not do. However, at last, as I said, I made one to answer, and covered it with Skins, the Hair upwards, So that it cast off the Rains like a Penthouse, and kept off the Sun so effectually, that I could walk out in the hottest of the Weather with greater Advantage than I could before in the coolest, and when I had no need of it, cou'd close it and carry it under my Arm. 
<br> 
<br> Thus I liv'd mighty comfortably, my Mind being entirely composed by resigning to the Will of God, and throwing my self wholly upon the Disposal of his Providence. This made my Life better than sociable, for when I began to regret the want of Conversation, I would ask my self whether thus conversing mutually with my own Thoughts, and, as I hope I may say, with even God himself by Ejaculations, was not better than the utmost Enjoyment of humane Society in the World. 
<br> 
<br> I cannot say that after this, for five Years, any extraordinary thing happened to me, but I liv'd on in the same Course, in the same Posture and Place, just as before; the chief things I was employ'd in, besides my yearly Labour of planting my Barley and Rice, and curing my Raisins, of both which I always kept up just enough to have sufficient Stock of one Year's Provisions beforehand. I say, besides this yearly Labour, and my daily Labour of going out with my Gun, I had one Labour to make me a Canoe, which at last I finished. So that by digging a Canal to it of six Foot wide, and four Foot deep, I brought it into the Creek, almost half a Mile. As for the first, which was so vastly big, as I made it without considering before-hand, as I ought to do, how I should be able to launch it; so never being able to bring it to the Water, or bring the Water to it, I was oblig'd to let it lye where it was, as a Memorandum to teach me to be wiser next Time: Indeed, the next Time, tho' I could not get a Tree proper for it, and in a Place where I could not get the Water to it, at any less Distance, than as I have said, near half a Mile; yet as I saw it was practicable at last, I never gave it over: and though I was near two Years about it, yet I never grutch'd my Labour, in Hopes of having a Boat to go off to Sea at last. 
<br> 
<br> However, though my little Periagua was finish'd; yet the Size of it was not at all answerable to the Design which I had in View, when I made the first; I mean, Of venturing over to the Terra Firma, where it was above forty Miles broad; accordingly, the Smallness of my Boat assisted to put an End to that Design, and now I thought no more of it: But as I had a Boat, my next Design was to make a Tour round the Island; for as I had been on the other Side, in one Place, crossing as I have already describ'd it, over the Land; so the Discoveries I made in that little Journey, made me very eager to see other Parts of the Coast; and now I had a Boat, I thought of nothing but sailing round the Island. 
<br> 
<br> For this Purpose, that I might do every Thing with Discretion and Consideration, I fitted up a little Mast to my Boat, and made a Sail to it, out of some of the Pieces of the Ship's Sail, which lay in store; and of which I had a great Stock by me. 
<br> 
<br> Having fitted my Mast and Sail, and try'd the Boat, I found she would sail very well: Then I made little Lockers, or Boxes, at either End of my Boat, to put Provisions, Necessaries and Ammunition, etc. into, to be kept dry, either from Rain, or the Sprye of the Sea; and a little long hollow Place I cut in the In-side of the Boat, where I could lay Gun, making a Flap to hang down over it to keep it dry. 
<br> 
<br> I fix'd my Umbrella also in a Step at the Stern, like a Mast, to stand over my Head, and keep the Heat of the Sun off of me like an Auning; and thus I every now and then took a little Voyage upon the Sea, but never went far out, nor far from the little Creek; but at last being eager to view the Circumference of my little Kingdom, I resolv'd upon my our, and accordingly I victuall'd my Ship for the Voyage, putting in two Dozen of my Loaves (Cakes I should rather All them) of Barley Bread, an Earthen Pot full of parch'd Rice, a Food I eat a great deal of, a little Bottle of Rum, half a Goat, and Powder and Shot for killing more, and two large Watch-coats, of those which, as I mention'd before, I had sav'd out of the Seamen's Chests; these I took, one to lye upon, and the other to cover me in the Night. 
<br> 
<br> It was the sixth of November, in the sixth Year of my Reign, or my Captivity, which you please, That I set out on this Voyage, and I found it much longer than I expected; for though the Island it self was not very large, yet when I me to the East Side of it, I found a great Ledge of Rocks lye out above two Leagues into the Sea, some above Water, some under it; and beyond that, a Shoal of Sand, lying dry half a League more; so that I was oblig'd to go a great Way out to Sea to double the Point. 
<br> 
<br> When first I discover'd them, I was going to give over my Enterprise, and come back again, not knowing how far it might oblige me to go out to Sea; and above all, doubting how I should get back again; so I came to an Anchor; for I had made me a kind of an Anchor with a Piece of a broken Graplin, which I got out of the Ship. 
<br> 
<br> Having secur'd my Boat, I took my Gun, and went on Shore, climbing up upon a Hill, which seem'd to over-look that Point, where I saw the full Extent of it, and resolv'd to venture. 
<br> 
<br> In my viewing the Sea from that Hill where I stood, I perceiv'd a strong, and indeed, a most furious Current, which run to the East, and even came close to the Point; and I took the more Notice of it, because I saw there might be some Danger; that when I came into it, I might be carry'd out to Sea by the Strength of it, and not be able to make the Island again; and indeed, had I not gotten first up upon this Hill, 1 believe it would have been so; for there was the same Current on the other Side the Island, only, that it set off at a farther Distance; and I saw there was a strong Eddy under the Shore; so I had nothing to do but to get in out of the first Current, and I should presently be in an Eddy. 
<br> 
<br> I lay here, however, two Days; because the Wind blowing pretty fresh at E.S.E. and that being just contrary to the said Current, made a great Breach of the Sea upon the Point; so that it was not safe for me to keep too close to the Shore for the Breach, nor to go too far off because of the Stream. 
<br> 
<br> The third Day in the Morning, the Wind having abated over Night, the Sea was calm, and I ventur'd; but I am a warning Piece again, to all rash and ignorant Pilots; for no sooner was I come to the Point, when even I was not my Boat's Length from the Shore, but I found my self in a great Depth of Water, and a Current like the Sluice of a Mill: It carry'd my Boat a long with it with such Violence, That all I could do, could not keep her so much as on the Edge of it; but I found it hurry'd me farther and farther out from the Eddy, which was on my left Hand. There was no Wind stirring to help me, and all I could do with my Paddlers signify'd nothing, and now I began to give my self over for lost; for as the Current was on both Sides the Island, I knew in a few Leagues Distance they must joyn again, and then I was irrecoverably gone; nor did I see any Possibility of avoiding it; so that I had no Prospect before me but of Perishing; not by the Sea, for that was calm enough, but of starving for Hunger. I had indeed found a Tortoise on the Shore, as big almost as I could lift, and had toss'd it into the Boat; and I had a great Jar of fresh Water, that is to say, one of my Earthen Pots; but what was all this to being driven into the vast Ocean, where to be sure, there was no Shore, no main Land, or Island, for a thousand Leagues at least. 
<br> 
<br> And now I saw how easy it was for the Providence of God make the most miserable Condition Mankind could be in worse. Now I look'd back upon my desolate solitary Island, the most pleasant Place in the World, and all the Happiness my Heart could wish for, was to be but there again. I stretch'd out my Hands to it with eager Wishes. O happy Desart said I, I shall never see thee more. O miserable Creature, said I, whether am I going: Then I reproach'd my Self with my unthankful Temper, and how I had repin'd at my solitary Condition; and now what would I give to be on Shore there again. Thus we never see the true State of our Condition, till it is illustrated to us by its Contraries; nor know how to value what we enjoy, but by the want of it. It is scarce possible to imagine the Consternation I was now in, being driven from my beloved Island (for so it appear'd to me now to be) into the wide Ocean, almost two Leagues, and in the utmost Despair of ever recovering it again. However, I work'd hard, till indeed my Strength was almost exhausted, and kept my Boat as much to the Northward, that is, towards the Side of the Current which the Eddy lay on, as possibly I could; when about Noon, as the Sun pass'd the Meridian, I thought I felt a little Breeze of Wind in my Face, springing up from the S.S.E. This chear'd my Heart a little, and especially when in about half an Hour more, it blew a pretty small gentle Gale. By this Time I was gotten at a frightful Distance from the Island, and had the least Cloud or haizy Weather interven'd, I had been undone another Way too; for I had no Compass on Board, and should never have known how to have steer'd towards the Island, if I had but once lost Sight of it; but the Weather continuing clear, I apply'd my self to get up my Mast again, spread my Sail, standing away to the North, as much as possible, to get out of the Current. 
<br> 
<br> Just as I had set my Mast and Sail, and the Boat began to stretch away, I saw even by the Clearness of the Water, some Alteration of the Current was near; for where the Current was so strong, the Water was foul; but perceiving the Water clear, I found the Current abate, and presently I found to the East, at about half a Mile, a Breach of the Sea upon some Rocks; these Rocks I found caus'd the Current to part again, and as the main Stress of it ran away more Southerly, leaving the Rocks to the North-East; so the other return'd by the Repulse of the Rocks, and made a strong Eddy, which run back again to the North-West, with a very sharp Stream. 
<br> 
<br> They who know what it is to have a Reprieve brought to them upon the Ladder, or to be rescued from Thieves just a going to murther them, or, who have been in such like Extremities, may guess what my present Surprise of Joy was, and how gladly I put my Boat into the Stream of this Eddy, and the Wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my Sail to it, running chearfully before the Wind, and with a strong Tide or Eddy under Foot. 
<br> 
<br> This Eddy carryed me about a League in my Way back again directly towards the Island, but about two Leagues more to the Northward than the Current which carried me away at first; so that when I came near the Island, I found my self open to the Northern Shore of it, that is to say, the other End of the Island opposite to that which I went out from. 
<br> 
<br> When I had made something more than a League of Way by the help of this Current or Eddy, I found it was spent and serv'd me no farther. However, I found that being between the two great Currents, (viz.) that on the South Side which had hurried me away, and that on the North which lay about a League on the other Side. I say between these two, in the wake of the Island, I found the Water at least still and running no Way, and having still a Breeze of Wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly for the Island, tho' not making such fresh Way as I did before. 
<br> 
<br> About four a-Clock in the Evening, being then within about a League of the Island, I found the Point of the Rocks which occasioned this Disaster, stretching out as is describ'd before to the Southward, and casting off the Current more Southwardly, had of Course made another Eddy to the North, and this I found very strong, but not directly setting the Way my Course lay which was due West, but almost full North. However having a fresh Gale, I stretch'd a-cross this Eddy slanting North-west, and in about an Hour came within about a Mile of the Shore, where it being smooth Water, I soon got to Land. 
<br> 
<br> When I was on Shore I fell on my Knees and gave God Thanks for my Deliverance, resolving to lay aside all Thoughts of my Deliverance by my Boat, and refreshing my self with such Things as I had, I brought my Boat close to the Shore in a little Cove that I had spy'd under some Trees, and lay'd me down to sleep, being quite spent with the Labour and Fatigue of the Voyage. 
<br> 
<br> I was now at a great Loss which Way to get Home with my Boat, I had run so much Hazard, and knew too much the Case to think of attempting it by the Way I went out, and what might be at the other Side (I mean the West Side) I knew not, nor had I any Mind to run any more Ventures; so I only resolved in the Morning to make my Way Westward along the Shore and to see if there was no Creek where I might lay up my Frigate in Safety, so as to have her again if I wanted her; in about three Mile or thereabout coasting the Shore, I came to a very good Inlet or Bay about a Mile over, which narrowed till it came to a very little Rivulet or Brook, where I found a very convenient Harbour for my Boat and where she lay as if she had been in a little Dock made on Purpose for her. Here I put in, and having stow'd my Boat very safe, I went on Shore to look about me and see where I was. 
<br> 
<br> I soon found I had but a little past by the Place where I had been before, when I travell'd on Foot to that Shore; so taking nothing out of my Boat, but my Gun and my Umbrella, for it was exceeding hot, I began my March: The Way was comfortable enough after such a Voyage as I had been upon, and I reach'd my old Bower in the Evening, where I found every thing standing as I left it; for I always kept it in good Order, being, as I said before, my Country House. 
<br> 
<br> I got over the Fence, and laid me down in the Shade to rest my Limbs; for I was very weary, and fell asleep: But judge you, if you can, that read my Story, what a Surprize I must be in, when I was wak'd out of my Sleep by a Voice calling me by my Name several times, Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe, poor Robin Crusoe, where are you Robin Crusoe? Where are you? Where have you been? 
<br> 
<br> I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigu'd with Rowing, or Paddling, as it is call'd, the first Part of the Day, and with walking the latter Part, that I did not wake thoroughly, but dozing between sleeping and waking, thought I dream'd that some Body spoke to me: But as the Voice continu'd to repeat Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe, at last I began to wake more perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frighted, and started up in the utmost Consternation: But no sooner were my Eyes open, but I saw my Poll sitting on the Top of the Hedge; and immediately knew that it was he that spoke to me; for just in such bemoaning Language I had used to talk to him, and teach him; and he had learn'd it so perfectly, that he would sit upon my Finger, and lay his Bill close to my Face, and cry, Poor Robin Crusoe, Where are you? Where have you been? How come you here? And such things as I had taught him. 
<br> 
<br> However, even though I knew it was the Parrot, and that indeed it could be no Body else, it was a good while before I could compose my self: First, I was amazed how the Creature got thither, and then, how he should just keep about the Place, and no where else: But as I was well satisfied it could be no Body but honest Poll, I got it over; and holding out my Hand, and calling him by his Name Poll, the sociable Creature came to me, and sat upon my Thumb, as he used to do, and continu'd talking to me, Poor Robin Crusoe, and how did I come here? and where had I been? just as if he had been overjoy'd to see me again; and so I carry'd him Home along with me. 
<br> 
<br> I had now had enough of rambling to Sea for some time, and had enough to do for many Days to sit still, and reflect upon the Danger I had been in: I would have been very glad to have had my Boat again on my Side of the Island; but I knew not how it was practicable to get it about as to the East Side of the Island, which I had gone round; I knew well enough there was no venturing that Way; my very heart would shrink, and my very Blood run chill but to think of it: And as to the other Side of the Island, I did not know how it might be there; but supposing the Current ran with the same Force against the Shore at the East as it pass'd by it on the other, I might run the same Risk of being driven down the Stream, and carry'd by the Island, as I had been before, of being carry'd away from it; so with these Thoughts I contented my self to be without any Boat, though it had been the Product of so many Months Labour to make it, and of so many more to get it unto the Sea. 
<br> 
<br> In this Government of my Temper, I remain'd near a Year, liv'd a very sedate retir'd Life, as you may well suppose; and my Thoughts being very much composed as to my Condition, and fully comforted in resigning my self to the Dispositions of Providence, I thought I liv'd really very happily in all things, except that of Society. 
<br> 
<br> I improv'd my self in this time in all the mechanick Exercises which my Necessities put me upon applying my self to, and I believe cou'd, upon Occasion, make a very good Carpenter, especially considering how few Tools I had. 
<br> 
<br> Besides this, I arriv'd at an unexpected Perfection in my Earthen Ware, and contriv'd well enough to make them with a Wheel, which I found infinitely easyer and better; because I made things round and shapable, which before were filthy things indeed to look on. But I think I was never more vain of my own Performance, or more joyful for any thing I found out, than for my being able to make a Tobacco-Pipe. And tho' it was a very ugly clumsy thing, when it was done, and only burnt red like other Earthen Ware, yet as it was hard and firm, and would draw the Smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it, for I had been always used to smoke, and there were Pipes in the Ship, but I forgot them at first, not knowing that there was Tobacco in the Island; and afterwards, when I search'd the Ship again, I could not come at any Pipes at all. 
<br> 
<br> In my Wicker Ware also I improved much, and made abundance of necessary Baskets, as well as my Invention shew'd me, tho not very handsome, yet they were such as were very handy and convenient for my laying things up in, or fetching things home in. For Example, if I kill'd a Goat abroad, I could hang it up in a Tree, flea it, and dress it, and cut it in Pieces, and bring it home in a Basket, and the like by a Turtle, I could cut it up, take out the Eggs, and a Piece or two of the Flesh, which was enough for me, and bring them home in a Basket, and leave the rest behind me. Also large deep Baskets were my Receivers for my Corn, which I always rubb'd out as soon as it was dry, and cured, and kept it in great Baskets. 
<br> 
<br> I began now to perceive my Powder abated considerably, and this was a Want which it was impossible for me to supply, and I began seriously to consider what I must do when I should have no more Powder; that is to say, how I should do to kill any Goat. I had, as is observ'd in the third Year of my being here, kept a young Kid, and bred her up tame, and I was in hope of getting a He-Goat, but I could not by any Means bring it to pass, 'till my Kid grew an old Goat; and I could never find in my Heart to kill her, till she dy'd at last of meer Age. 
<br> 
<br> But being now in the eleventh Year of my Residence, and, as I have said, my Ammunition growing low, I set my self to study some Art to trap and snare the Goats, to see whether I could not catch some of them alive, and particularly I wanted a She-Goat great with young. 
<br> 
<br> To this Purpose I made Snares to hamper them, and I do believe they were more than once taken in them, but my Tackle was not good, for I had no Wire, and I always found them broken, and my Bait devoured. 
<br> 
<br> At length I resolv'd to try a Pit-fall, so I dug several large Pits in the Earth, in Places where I had observ'd the Goats used to feed, and over these Pits I plac'd Hurdles of my own baking too, with a great Weight upon them; and several times I put Ears of Barley, and dry Rice, without setting the Trap, and I could easily perceive that the Goats had gone in and eaten up the Corn, for I could see the Mark of their Feet. At length I set three Traps in one Night, and going the next Morning I found them all standing, and yet the Bait eaten and gone: This was very discouraging. However, I alter'd my Trap, and, not to trouble you with Particulars, going one Morning to see my Trap, I found in one of them a large old He-Goat, and in one of the other, three Kids, a Male and two Females. 
<br> 
<br> As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him, he was so fierce I durst not go into the Pit to him; that is to say, to go about to bring him away alive, which was what I wanted. I could have kill'd him, but that was not my Business, nor would it answer my End. So I e'en let him out, and he ran away as if he had been frighted out of his Wits: But I had forgot then what I learn'd afterwards, that Hunger will tame a Lyon. If I had let him stay there three or four Days without Food, and then have carry'd him some Water to drink, and then a little Corn, he would have been as tame as one of the Kids, for they are mighty sagacious tractable Creatures where they are well used. 
<br> 
<br> However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at that time; then I went to the three Kids, and taking them one by one, I tyed them with Strings together, and with some Difficulty brought them all home. 
<br> 
<br> It was a good while before they wou'd feed, but throwing them some sweet Corn, it tempted them and they began to be tame; and now I found that if I expected to supply my self with Goat-Flesh when I had no Powder or Shot left, breeding some up tame was my only way, when perhaps I might have them about my House like a Flock of Sheep. 
<br> 
<br> But then it presently occurr'd to me, that I must keep the tame from the wild, or else they would always run wild when they grew up, and the only Way for this was to have some enclosed Piece of Ground, well fenc'd either with Hedge or Pale, to keep them in so effectually, that those within might not break out, or those without break in. 
<br> 
<br> This was a great Undertaking for one Pair of Hands, yet as I saw there was an absolute Necessity of doing it, my first Piece of Work was to find out a proper Piece of Ground, viz. where there was likely to be Herbage for them to eat, Water for them to drink, and Cover to keep them from the Sun. 
<br> 
<br> Those who understand such Enclosures will think I had very little Contrivance, when I pitch'd upon a Place very proper for all these, being a plain open Piece of Meadow-Land, or Savanna, (as our People call it in the Western Collonies,) which had two or three little Drills' of fresh Water in it, and at one end was very woody. I say they will smile at my Forecast, when I shall tell them I began my enclosing of this Piece of Ground in such a manner, that my Hedge or Pale must have been at least two Mile about. Nor was the Madness of it so great as to the Compass, for if it was ten Mile about I was like to have time enough to do it in. But I did not consider that my Goats would be as wild in so much Compass as if they had had the whole Island, and I should have so much Room to chace them in, that I should never catch them. 
<br> 
<br> My Hedge was begun and carry'd on, I believe, about fifty Yards, when this Thought occurr'd to me, so I presently stopt short, and for the first beginning I resolv'd to enclose a Piece of about 150 Yards in length, and 100 Yards in breadth, which as it would maintain as many as I should have in any reasonable time, so as my Flock encreased, I could add more Ground to my Enclosure. 
<br> 
<br> This was acting with some Prudence, and I went to work with Courage. I was about three Months hedging in the first Piece, and till I had done it I tether'd the three Kids in the best part of it, and us'd them to feed as near me as possible to make them familiar; and very often I would go and carry them some Ears of Barley, or a handful of Rice, and feed them out of my Hand; so that after my Enclosure was finished, and I let them loose, they would follow me up and down, bleating after me for a handful of Corn. 
<br> 
<br> This answer'd my End, and in about a Year and half I had a Flock of about twelve Goats, Kids and all; and in two Years more I had three and forty, besides several that I took and kill'd for my Food. And after that I enclosed five several Pieces of Ground to feed them in, with little Pens to drive them into, to take them as I wanted, and Gates out of one Piece of Ground into another. 
<br> 
<br> But this was not all, for now I not only had Goats Flesh to feed on when I pleas'd, but Milk too, a thing which indeed in my beginning I did not so much as think of, and which, when it came into my Thoughts, was really an agreeable Surprize. For now I set up my Dairy, and had sometimes a Gallon or two of Milk in a Day. And as Nature, who gives Supplies of Food to every Creature, dictates even naturally how to make use of it; so I that had never milk'd a Cow, much less a Goat, or seen Butter or Cheese made, very readily and handily, tho' after a great many Essays and Miscarriages, made me both Butter and Cheese at last, and never wanted it afterwards. 
<br> 
<br> How mercifully can our great Creator treat his Creatures, even in those Conditions in which they seem'd to be overwhelm'd in Destruction. How can he sweeten the bitterest Providences, and give us Cause to praise him for Dungeons and Prisons. What a Table was here spread for me in a Wilderness, where I saw nothing at first but to perish for Hunger. 
<br> 
<br> It would have made a Stoick smile to have seen, me and my little Family sit down to Dinner; there was my Majesty the Prince and Lord of the whole island; I had the Lives of all my Subjects at my absolute Command. I could hang, draw, give Liberty, and take it away, and no Rebels among all my Subjects. 
<br> 
<br> Then to see how like a King I din'd too all alone, attended by my Servants, Poll, as if he had been my Favourite, was the only Person permitted to talk to me. My Dog who was now grown very old and crazy, and had found no Species to multiply his Kind upon, sat always at my Right Hand, and two Cats, one on one Side the Table, and one on the other, expecting now and then a Bit from my Hand, as a Mark of special Favour. 
<br> 
<br> But these were not the two Cats which I brought on Shore at first, for they were both of them dead, and had been interr'd near my Habitation by my own Hand; but one of them having multiply'd by I know not what Kind of Creature, these were two which I had preserv'd tame, whereas the rest run wild in the Woods, and became indeed troublesom to me at last; for they would often come into my House, and plunder me too, till at last I was obliged to shoot them, and did kill a great many; at length they left me with this Attendance, and in this plentiful Manner I lived; neither could I be said to want any thing but Society, and of that in some time after this, I was like to have too much. 
<br> 
<br> I was something impatient, as I have observ'd, to have the Use of my Boat; though very loath to run any more Hazards; and therefore sometimes I sat contriving Ways to get her about the Island, and at other Times I sat my self down contented enough without her. But I had a strange Uneasiness in my Mind to go down to the Point of the Island, where, as I have said, in my last Ramble, I went up the Hill to see how the Shore lay, and how the Current set, that I might see what I had to do: This Inclination encreas'd upon me every Day, and at length I resolv'd to travel thither by Land, following the Edge of the Shore. I did so: But had any one in England been to meet such a Man as I was, it must either have frighted them, or rais'd a great deal of Laughter; and as I frequently stood still to look at my self, I could not but smile at the Notion of my travelling though Yorkshire with such an Equipage, and in such a Dress: Be pleas'd to take a Scetch of my Figure as follows, 
<br> 
<br> I had a great high shapeless Cap, made of a Goat's Skin, with a Flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the Sun from me, as to shoot the Rain off from running into my Neck; nothing being so hurtful in these Climates, as the Rain upon the Flesh under the Cloaths. 
<br> 
<br> I had a short Jacket of Goat-Skin, the Skirts coming down to about the middle of my Thighs; and a Pair of open-knee'd Breeches of the same, the Breeches were made of the Skin of an old He-goat, whose Hair hung down such a Length on either Side, that like Pantaloons it reach'd to the middle of my Legs; Stockings and Shoes I had none, but had made me a Pair of some-things, I scarce know what to call them, like Buskins to flap over my Legs, and lace on either Side like Spatter-dashes; but of a most barbarous Shape, as indeed were all the rest of my Cloaths. 
<br> 
<br> I had on a broad Belt of Goats-Skin dry'd, which I drew together with two Thongs of the same, instead of Buckles, and in a kind of a Frog on either Side of this. Instead of a Sword and a Dagger, hung a little Saw and a Hatchet, one on one Side, one on the other. I had another Belt not so broad, and fasten'd in the same Manner, which hung over my Shoulder; and at the End of it, under my left Arm, hung two Pouches, both made of Goat's-Skin too; in one of which hung my Powder, in the other my Shot: At my Back I carry'd my Basket, on my Shoulder my Gun, and over my Head a great clumsy ugly Goat-Skin Umbrella, but which, after all, was the most necessary Thing I had about me, next to my Gun: As for my Face, the Colour of it was really not so Moletta-like as one might expect from a Man not at all careful of it, and living within nine or ten Degrees of the Equinox. My Beard I had once suffer'd to grow till it was about a Quarter of a Yard long; but as I had both Scissars and Razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, except what grew on my upper Lip, which I had trimm'd into a large Pair of Mahometan Whiskers, such as I had seen worn by some Turks, who I saw at Sallee; for the Moors did not wear such, tho' the Turks did; of these Muschatoes or Whiskers, I will not say they were long enough to hang my Hat upon them; but they were of a Length and Shape monstrous enough, and such as in England would have pass'd for frightful. 
<br> 
<br> But all this is by the by; for as to my Figure, I had so few to observe me, that it was of no manner of Consequence; so I say no more to that Part. In this kind of Figure I went my new Journey, and was out five or six Days. I travell'd first along the Sea Shore, directly to the Place where I first brought my Boat to an Anchor, to get up upon the Rocks; and having no Boat now to take care of, I went over the Land a nearer Way to the same Height that I was upon before, when looking forward to the Point of the Rocks which lay out, and which I was oblig'd to double with my Boat, as is said above: I was surpriz'd to see the Sea all smooth and quiet, no Ripling, no Motion, no Current, any more there than in other Places. 
<br> 
<br> I was at a strange Loss to understand this, and resolv'd to spend some Time in the observing it, to see if nothing from the Sets of the Tide had occasion'd it; but I was presently convinc'd how it was, viz. That the Tide of Ebb setting from the West, and joyning with the Current of Waters from some great River on the Shore, must be the Occasion of this Current; and that according as the Wind blew more forcibly from the West, or from the North, this Current came nearer, or went farther from the Shore; for waiting thereabouts till Evening, I went up to the Rock again, and then the Tide of Ebb being made, I plainly saw the Current again as before, only, that it run farther off, being near half a League from the Shore; whereas in my Case, it set close upon the Shore, and hurry'd me and my Canoe along with it, which at another Time it would not have done. 
<br> 
<br> This Observation convinc'd me, That I had nothing to do but to observe the Ebbing and the Flowing of the Tide, and I might very easily bring my Boat about the Island again: But when I began to think of putting it in Practice, I had such a Terror upon my Spirits at the Remembrance of the Danger I had been in, that I could not think of it again with any Patience; but on the contrary, I took up another Resolution which was more safe, though more laborious; and this was, That I would build, or rather make me another Periagua or Canoe; and so have one for one Side of the Island, and one for the other. 
<br> 
<br> You are to understand, that now I had, as I may call it, two Plantations in the Island; one my little Fortification or Tent, with the Wall about it under the Rock, with the Cave behind me, which by this Time I had enlarg'd into several Apartments, or Caves, one within another. One of these, which was the dryest, and largest, and had a Door out beyond my Wall or Fortification; that is to say, beyond where my Wall joyn'd to the Rock, was all fill'd up with the large Earthen Pots, of which I have given an Account, and with fourteen or fifteen great Baskets, which would hold five or six Bushels each, where I laid up my Stores of Provision, especially my Corn, some in the Ear cut off short from the Straw, and the other rubb'd out with my Hand. 
<br> 
<br> A for my Wall made, as before, with long Stakes or Piles, those Piles grew all like Trees, and were by this Time grown so big, and spread so very much, that there was not the least Appearance to any one's View of any Habitation behind them. 
<br> 
<br> Near this Dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the Land, and upon lower Ground, lay my two Pieces of Corn-Ground, which I kept duly cultivated and sow'd, and which duly yielded me their Harvest in its Season; and whenever I had occasion for more Corn, I had more Land adjoyning as fit as that. 
<br> 
<br> Besides this, I had my Country Seat, and I had now a tollerable Plantation there also; for first, I had my little Bower, as I call'd it, which I kept in Repair; that is to say, I kept the Hedge which circled it in, constantly fitted up to its usual Height, the Ladder standing always in the Inside; I kept the Trees which at first were no more than my Stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall; I kept them always so cut, that they might spread and grow thick and wild, and make the more agreeable Shade, which they did effectually to my Mind. In the Middle of this I had my Tent always standing, being a piece of a Sail spread over Poles set up for that Purpose, and which never wanted any Repair or Renewing; and under this I had made me a Squab or Couch, with the Skins of the Creatures I had kill'd, and with other soft Things, and a Blanket laid on them, such as belong'd to our Sea-Bedding, which I had saved, and a great Watch-Coat to cover me; and here, whenever I had Occasion to be absent from my chief Seat, I took up my Country Habitation. 
<br> 
<br> Adjoyning to this I had my Enclosures for my Cattle, that is to say, my Goats: And as I had taken an inconceivable deal of Pains to fence and enclose this Ground, so I was so uneasy to see it kept entire, lest the Goats should break thro', that I never left off till with infinite Labour I had stuck the Out-side of the Hedge so full of small Stakes, and so near to one another, that it was rather a Pale than a Hedge, and there was scarce Room to put a Hand thro' between them, which afterwards when those Stakes grew, as they all did in the next rainy Season, made the Enclosure strong like a Wall, indeed stronger than any Wall. 
<br> 
<br> This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared no Pains to bring to pass whatever appear'd necessary for my comfortable Support; for I consider'd the keeping up a Breed of tame Creatures thus at my Hand, would be a living Magazine of Flesh, Milk, Butter and Cheese, for me as long as I liv'd in the Place, if it were to be forty Years; and that keeping them in my Reach, depended entirely upon my perfecting my Enclosures to such a Degree, that I might be of keeping them together; which by this Method indeed I so effectually secur'd, that when these little Stakes began to grow, I had planted them so very thick, I was forced to pw some of them up again. 
<br> 
<br> In this Place also I had my Grapes growing, which I principally depended on for my Winter Store of Raisins; and which I never fail'd to preserve very carefully, as the best and most agreeable Dainty of my whole Diet; and indeed they were not agreeable only, but physical, whole-some, nourishing, and refreshing to the last Degree. 
<br> 
<br> As this was also about half Way between my other Habitation, and the Place where I had laid up my Boat, I generally stay'd, and lay here in my Way thither; for I used frequently to visit my Boat, and I kept all Things about or belonging to her in very good Order; sometimes I went out in her to divert my self, but no more hazardous Voyages would I go, nor scarce ever above a Stone's Cast or two from the Shore, I was so apprehensive of being hurry'd out my Knowledge again by the Currents, or Winds, or any ether Accident. But now I come to a new Scene of my Life. It happen'd one Day about Noon going towards my Boat, I was exceedingly surpriz'd with the Print of a Man's naked Foot on the Shore, which was very plain to be seen in the Sand: I stood like one Thunder-struck, or as if I had seen an Apparition; I listen'd, I look'd round me, I could hear nothing, nor see any Thing, I went up to a rising Ground to look farther, I went up the Shore and down the Shore, but it was all one, I could see no other Impression but that one, I went to it again to see if there were any more, and to observe if it might not be my Fancy; but there was no Room for that, for there was exactly the very Print of a Foot, Toes, Heel, and every Part of a Foot; how it came thither, I knew not, nor could in the least imagine. But after innumerable fluttering Thoughts, like a Man perfectly confus'd and out of my self, I came Home to my Fortification, not feeling, as we say, the Ground I went on, but terrify'd to the last Degree, looking behind me at every two or three Steps, mistaking every Bush and Tree, and fancying every Stump at a Distance to be a Man; nor is it possible to describe how many various Shapes affrighted Imagination represented Things to me in, how many wild Ideas were found every Moment in my Fancy, and what strange unaccountable Whimsies came into my Thoughts by the Way. 
<br> 
<br> When I came to my Castle, for so I think I call'd it ever after this, I fled into it like one pursued; whether I went over by the Ladder as first contriv'd, or went in at the Hole in the Rock, which I call'd a Door, I cannot remember; no, nor could I remember the next Morning, for never frighted Hare fled to Cover, or Fox to Earth, with more Terror of Mind than I to this Retreat. 
<br> 
<br> I slept none that Night; the farther I was from the Occasion of my Fright, the greater my Apprehensions were, which is something contrary to the Nature of such Things, and especially to the usual Practice of all Creatures in Fear: But I was so embarrass'd with my own frightful Ideas of the Thing, that I form'd nothing but dismal Imaginations to my self, even tho' I was now a great way off of it. Sometimes I fancy'd it must be the Devil; and Reason joyn'd in with me upon this Supposition: For how should any other Thing in human Shape come into the Place? Where was the Vessel that brought them? What Marks was there of any other Footsteps? And how was it possible a Man should come there? But then to think that Satan should take human Shape upon him in such a Place where there could be no manner of Occasion for it, but to leave the Print of his Foot behind him, and that even for no Purpose too, for he could not be sure I should see it; this was an Amusement the other Way; I consider'd that the Devil might have found out abundance of other Ways to have terrify'd me than this of the single Print of a Foot. That as I liv'd quite on the other Side of the Island, he would never have been so simple to leave a Mark in a Place where 'twas Ten Thousand to one whether I should ever see it Or not, and in the Sand too, which the first Surge of the Sea upon a high Wind would have defac'd entirely: All this seem'd inconsistent with the Thing it self, and with all the Notions we usually entertain of the Subtilty of the Devil. 
<br> 
<br> Abundance of such Things as these assisted to argue me out' of all Apprehensions of its being the Devil: And I presently concluded then, that it must be some more dangerous Creature, (viz.) That it must be some of the Savages of the main Land over-against me, who had wander'd out to Sea in their Canoes; and either driven by the Currents, or by contrary Winds had made the Island; and had been on Shore, but were gone away again to Sea, being as loth, perhaps, to have stay'd in this desolate Island, as I would have been to have had them. 
<br> 
<br> While these Reflections were rowling upon my Mind, I was very thankful in my Thoughts, that I was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that Time, or that they did not see my Boat, by which they would have concluded that some Inhabitants had been in the Place, and perhaps have search'd farther for me: Then terrible Thoughts rack'd my Imagination about their having found my Boat, and that there were People here; and that if so, I should certainly have them come again in greater Numbers, and devour me; that if it should happen so that they should not find me, yet they would find my Enclosure, destroy all my Corn, carry away all my Flock of tame Goats, and I should perish at last for meer Want. 
<br> 
<br> Thus my Fear banish'd all my religious Hope; all that former Confidence in God which was founded upon such wonderful Experience as I had had of his Goodness, now vanished, as if he that had fed me by Miracle hitherto, could not preserve by his Power the Provision which he had made for me by his Goodness: I reproach'd my self with my Easiness, that would not sow any more Corn one Year than would just serve me till the next Season, as if no Accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying the Crop that was upon the Ground; and this I thought so just a Reproof, that I resolv'd for the future to have two or three Years Corn beforehand, so that whatever might come, I might not perish for want of Bread. 
<br> 
<br> How strange a Chequer Work of Providence is the Life of Man! and by what secret differing Springs are the Affections hurry'd about as differing Circumstance present To Day we love what to Morrow we hate; to Day we seek what to Morrow we shun; to Day we desire what to Morrow we fear; nay even tremble at the Apprehensions of; this was exemplify'd in me at this Time in the most lively Manner imaginable; for I whose only Affliction was, that I seem'd banished from human Society, that I was alone, circumscrib'd by the boundless Ocean, cut off from Mankind, and condemn'd to what I call'd silent Life; that I was as one who Heaven thought not worthy to be number'd among the Living, or to appear among the rest of his Creatures; that to have seen one of my own Species, would have seem'd to me a Raising me from Death to Life, and the greatest Blessing that Heaven it self, next to the supreme Blessing of Salvation, could bestow; I say, that I should now tremble at the very Apprehensions of seeing a Man, and was ready to sink into the Ground at but the Shadow or silent Appearance of a Man's having set his Foot in the Island. 
<br> 
<br> Such is the uneven State of human Life: And it afforded me a great many curious Speculations afterwards, when I had a little recover'd my first Surprize; I consider'd that this was the Station of Life the infinitely wise and good Providence of God had determin'd for me, that as I could not foresee what the Ends of Divine Wisdom might be in all this, so I was not to dispute his Sovereignty, who, as I was his Creature, had an undoubted Right by Creation to govern and dispose of me absolutely as he thought fit; and who, as I was a Creature who had offended him, had likewise a judicial Right to condemn me to what Punishment he thought fit; and that it was my Part to submit to bear his Indignation, because I had sinn'd against him. 
<br> 
<br> I then reflected that God, who was not only Righteous but Onmipotent, as he had thought fit thus to punish and afflict me, so he was able to deliver me; that if he did not think fit to do it, 'twas my unquestion'd Duty to resign my self absolutely and entirely to his Will; and on the other Hand, it was my Duty also to hope in him, pray to him, and quietly to attend the Dictates and Directions of his daily Providence. 
<br> 
<br> These Thoughts took me up many Hours, Days; nay, I may say, Weeks and Months; and one particular Effect of my Cogitations on this Occasion, I cannot omit, viz. One Morning early, lying in my Bed, and fill'd with Thought about my Danger from the Appearance of Savages, I found it discompos'd me very much, upon which those Words of the Scripture came into my Thoughts, Call upon me in the Day of Trouble, and I will deliver, and thou shalt glorify me. 
<br> 
<br> Upon this, rising chearfully out of my Bed, my Heart was not only comforted, but I was guided and encourag'd to pray earnestly to God for Deliverance: When I had done praying, I took up my Bible, and opening it to read, the first Words that presented to me, were, Wait on the Lord, and be of good Cheer, and he shall strengthen thy Heart; wait, I say, on the Lord: It is impossible to express the Comfort this gave me. In Answer, I thankfully laid down the Book, and was no more sad, at least, not on that Occasion. 
<br> 
<br> In the middle of these Cogitations, Apprehensions and Reflections, it came into my Thought one Day, that all this might be a meer Chimera of my own; and that this Foot might be the Print of my own Foot, when I came on Shore from my Boat: This chear'd me up a little too, and I began to perswade my self it was all a Delusion; that it was nothing else but my own Foot, and why might not I come that way from the Boat, as well as I was going that way to the Boat; again, I consider'd also that I could by no Means tell for certain where I had trod, and where I had not; and that if at last this was only the Print of my own Foot, I had play'd the Part of those Fools, who strive to make stories of Spectres, and Apparitions; and then are frighted at them more than any body. 
<br> 
<br> Now I began to take Courage, and to peep abroad again; for I had not stirr'd out of my Castle for three Days and Nights; so that I began to starve for Provision; for I had little or nothing within Doors, but some Barley Cakes and water. Then I knew that my Goats wanted to be milk'd too, which usually was my Evening Diversion; and the poor Creatures were in great Pain and Inconvenience for want of it; and indeed, it almost spoil'd some of them, and almost dry'd up their Milk. 
<br> 
<br> Heartning my self therefore with the Belief that this was nothing but the Print of one of my own Feet, and so I might be truly said to start at my own Shadow, I began to go abroad again, and went to my Country House, to milk my Flock; but to see with what Fear I went forward, how often I look'd behind me, how I was ready every now and then to lay down my Basket, and run for my Life, it would have made any one have thought I was haunted with an evil Conscience, or that I had been lately most terribly frighted, and so indeed I had. 
<br> 
<br> However, as I went down thus two or three Days, and having seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder; and to think there was really nothing in it, but my own Imagination: But I cou'd not perswade my self fully of this, till I should go down to the Shore again, and see this Print of a Foot, and measure it by my own, and see if there was any Similitude or Fitness, that I might be assur'd it was my own Foot: But when I came to the Place, First, It appear'd evidently to me, that when I laid up my Boat, I could not possibly be on Shore any where there about. Secondly, When I came to measure the Mark with my own Foot, I found my Foot not so large by a great deal; both these Things fill'd my Head with new Imaginations, and gave me the Vapours again, to the highest Degree; so that I shook with cold, like one in an Ague: And I went Home again, fill'd with the Belief that some Man Or Men had been on Shore there; or in short, that the Island was inhabited, and I might be surpriz'd before I was aware; and what course to take for my Security I knew not. 
<br> 
<br> O what ridiculous Resolution Men take, when possess'd with Fear! It deprives them of the Use of those Means which Reason offers for their Relief. The first Thing I propos'd to my self, was, to throw down my Enclosures, and turn all my tame Cattle wild into the Woods, that the Enemy might not find them; and then frequent the Island in Prospect of the same, or the like Booty: Then to the simple' Thing of Digging up my two Corn Fields, that they might not find such a Grain there, and still be prompted to frequent the Island; then to demolish my Bower, and Tent, that they might not see any Vestiges of Habitation, and be prompted to look farther, in order to find out the Persons inhabiting. 
<br> 
<br> These were the Subject of the first Night's Cogitation, after I was come Home again, while the Apprehensions which had so over-run my Mind were fresh upon me, and my Head was full of Vapours, as above: Thus Fear of Danger is ten thousand Times more terrifying than Danger it self, when apparent to the Eyes; and we find the Burthen of Anxiety greater by much, than the Evil which we are anxious about; and which was worse than all this, I had not that Relief in this Trouble from the Resignation I used to practice, that I hop'd to have. I look'd, I thought, like Saul, who complain'd not only that the Philistines were upon him; but that God had forsaken him; for I did not now take due Ways to compose my Mind, by crying to God in my Distress, and resting upon his Providence, as I had done before, for my Defence and Deliverance; which if I had done, I had, at least, been more cheerfully supported under this new Surprise, and perhaps carry'd through it with more Resolution. 
<br> 
<br> This Confusion of my Thoughts kept me waking all Night; but in the Morning I fell asleep, and having by the Amusement of my Mind, been, as it were, tyr'd, and my Spirits exhausted; I slept very soundly, and wak'd much better compos'd than I had ever been before; and now I began to think sedately; and upon the utmost Debate with my self, I concluded, That this Island, which was so exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the main Land than as I had seen, was not so entirely abandon'd as I might imagine: That altho' there were no stated Inhabitants who liv'd on the Spot; yet that there might sometimes come Boats off from the Shore, who either with Design, or perhaps never, but when they were driven by cross Winds, might come to this Place. 
<br> 
<br> That I had liv'd here fifteen Years now, and had not met with the least Shadow or Figure of any People yet; and that if at any Time they should be driven here, it was probable they went away again as soon as ever they could, seeing they had never thought fit to fix there upon any Occasion, to this Time. 
<br> 
<br> That the most I cou'd suggest any Danger from, was, from any such casual accidental Landing of straggling People from the Main, who, as it was likely if they were driven hither, were here against their Wills; so they made no stay here, but went off again with all possible Speed, seldom staying one Night on Shore, least they should not have the Help of the Tides, and Day-light back again; and that therefore I had nothing to do but to consider of some safe Retreat, in Case I should see any Savages land upon the Spot. 
<br> 
<br> Now I began sorely to repent, that I had dug my Cave so large, as to bring a Door through again, which Door, as I said, came out beyond where my Fortification joyn'd to the Rock; upon maturely considering this therefore, I resolv'd to draw me a second Fortification, in the same Manner of a Semicircle, at a Distance from my Wall, just where I had planted a double Row of Trees, about twelve Years before, of which I made mention: These Trees having been planted so thick before, they wanted but a few Piles to be driven between them, that they should be thicker, and stronger, and my Wall would be soon finish'd. 
<br> 
<br> So that I had now a double Wall, and my Outer Wall was thickned with Pieces Of Timber, old Cables, and every Thing I could think of, to make it strong; having in it seven little Holes, about as big as I might put my Arm out at: In the In-side of this, I thickned my Wall to above ten Foot thick, with continual bringing Earth out of my Cave, and laying it at the Foot of the Wall, and walking upon it; and through the seven Holes, I contriv'd to plant the Musquets, of which I took Notice, that I got seven on Shore out of the Ship; these, I say, I planted like my Cannon, and fitted them into Frames that held them like a Carriage, that so I could fire all the seven Guns in two Minutes Time: This Wall I was many a weary Month a finishing, and yet never thought my self safe till it was done. 
<br> 
<br> When this was done, I stuck all the Ground without my Wall, for a great way every way, as full with Stakes or Sticks of the Osier like Wood, which I found so apt to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch, that I believe I might set in near twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty large Space between them and my Wall, that I might have room to see an Enemy, and they might have no shelter from the young Trees, if they attempted to approach my outer Wall. 
<br> 
<br> Thus in two Years Time I had a thick Grove and in five or six Years Time I had a Wood before my Dwelling, growing so monstrous thick and strong, that it was indeed perfectly impassable; and no Men of what kind soever, would ever imagine that there was any Thing beyond it, much less a Habitation: As for the Way which I propos'd to my self to go in and out, for I left no Avenue; it was by setting two Ladders, one to a Part of the Rock which was low and then broke in, and left room to place another Ladder upon that; so when the two Ladders were taken down, no Man living could come down to me without mischieving himself; and if they had come down, they were still on the Out-side of my outer Wall. 
<br> 
<br> Thus I took all the Measures humane Prudence could suggest for my own Preservation; and it will be seen at length, that they were not altogether without just Reason; though I foresaw nothing at that Time, more than my meer Fear suggested to me. 
<br> 
<br> While this was doing, I was not altogether Careless of my other Affairs; for I had a great Concern upon me, for my little Herd of Goats; they were not only a present Supply to me upon every Occasion, and began to be sufficient to me, without the Expence of Powder and Shot; but also without the Fatigue of Hunting after the wild Ones, and I was loth to lose the Advantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over again. 
<br> 
<br> To this Purpose, after long Consideration, I could think of but two Ways to preserve them; one was to find another convenient Place to dig a Cave Under-ground, and to drive them into it every Night; and the other was to enclose two or three little Bits of Land, remote from one another and as much conceal'd as I could, where I might keep about half a Dozen young Goats in each Place: So that if any Disaster happen'd to the Flock in general, I might be able to raise them again with little Trouble and Time: And this, tho' it would require a great deal of Time and Labour, I thought was the most rational Design. 
<br> 
<br> Accordingly I spent some Time to find out the most retir'd Parts of the Island; and I pitch'd upon one which was as private indeed as my Heart could wish for; it was a little damp Piece of Ground in the Middle of the hollow and thick Woods, where, as is observ'd, I almost lost my self once before, endeavouring to Come back that Way from the Eastern Part of the Island: Here I found a clear Piece of Land near three Acres, so surrounded with Woods, that it was almost an Enclosure by Nature, at least it did not want near so much Labour to make it so, as the other Pieces of Ground I had work'd so hard at. 
<br> 
<br> I immediately went to Work with this Piece of Ground, and in less than a Month's Time, I had so fenc'd it round, that my Flock or Herd, call it which you please, who were not so wild now as at first they might be supposed to be, were well enough secur'd in it. So, without any farther Delay, I removed ten young She-Goats and two He-Goats to this Piece; and when they were there, I continued to perfect the Fence till I had made it as secure as the other, which, however, I did at more Leisure, and it took me up more Time by a great deal. 
<br> 
<br> All this Labour I was at the Expence of, purely from my Apprehensions on the Account of the Print of a Man's Foot which I had seen; for as yet I never saw any human Creature come near the Island, and I had now liv'd two Years under these Uneasinesses, which indeed made my Life much less comfortable than it was before; as may well be imagin'd by any who know what it is to live in the constant Snare of the Fear of Man; and this I must observe with Grief too, that the Discomposure of my Mind had too great Impressions also upon the religious Part of my Thoughts, for the Dread and Terror of falling into the Hands of Savages and Canibals, lay so upon my Spirits, that I seldom found my self in a due Temper for Application to my Maker, at least not with the sedate Calmness and Resignation of Soul which I was wont to do; I rather pray'd to God as under great Affliction and Pressure of Mind, surrounded with Danger, and in Expectation every Night of being murther'd and devour'd before Morning; and I must testify from my Experience, that a Temper of Peace, Thankfulness, Love and Affection, is much more the proper Frame for Prayer than that of Terror and Discomposure; and that under the Dread of Mischief impending, a Man is no more fit for a comforting Performance of the Duty of praying to God, than he is for Repentance on a sick Bed: For these Discomposures affect the Mind as the others do the Body; and the Discomposure of the Mind must necessarily be as great a Disability as that of the Body, and much greater, Praying to God being properly an Act Of the Mind, not of the Body. 
<br> 
<br> But to go on; After I had thus secur'd one Part of my little living Stock, I went about the whole Island, searching for another private Place, to make such another Deposit; when wandring more to the West Point of the Island, than I had ever done yet, and looking out to Sea, I thought I saw a Boat upon the Sea, at a great Distance; I had found a Prospective Glass, or two, in one of the Seamen's Chests, which I sav'd out of our Ship; but I had it not about me, and this was so remote, that I could not tell what to make of it; though I look'd at it till my Eyes were not able to hold to look any longer; whether it was a Boat, or not, I do not know; but as I descended from the Hill, I could see no more of it, so I gave it over; only I resolv'd to go no more out without a Prospective Glass in my Pocket. 
<br> 
<br> When I was come down the Hill, to the End of the Island, where indeed I had never been before, I was presently convinc'd, that the seeing the Print of a Man's Foot, was not such a strange Thing in the Island as I imagin'd; and but that it was a special Providence that I was cast upon the Side of the Island, where the Savages never came: I should easily have known, that nothing was more frequent than for the Canoes from the Main, when they happen'd to be a little too far out at Sea, to shoot over to that Side of the Island for Harbour; likewise as they often met, and fought in their Canoes, the Victors having taken any Prisoners, would bring them over to this Shore, where according to their dreadful Customs, being all Canibals, they would kill and eat them; of which hereafter.
<br> &nbsp;
<br> &nbsp;
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 我有很多的龟鳖，但我只要偶尔吃一两只就够了。 
<br> 
<br> 我有充足的木材，可以用来建造一支船队。我有足够的葡萄，可以用来酿酒或制葡萄干，等把船队建成后，可以把每只船都装满。
<br> 
<br> 我只能使用对我有用的那些东西。我已经够用够吃，还贪图别的什么呢？若猎获物太多，吃不了就得让狗或虫豸去吃；若粮食收获太多，吃不了就会发霉；树木砍倒不用，躺在地上就会腐烂，除了作柴烧烹煮食物外，根本没有什么别的用处。
<br> 
<br> 总之，事理和经验使我懂得，世间万物，只是有用处，才是最可宝贵的。任何东西，积攒多了，就应送给别人；我们能够享用的，至多不过是我们能够使用的部分，多了也没有用。即使是世界上最贪婪、最一毛不拔的守钱奴，处在我现在的地位，也会把贪得无厌的毛病治好，因为我现在太富有了，简直不知道如何支配自己的财富。我心里已没有任何贪求的欲念。我缺的东西不多，所缺的也都是一些无足轻重的小东西。前面我曾提到过，我有一包钱币，其中有金币，也有银币，总共大约值三十六金镑。可是，这些肮脏、可悲而又无用的东西，至今还放在那里，对我毫无用处。我自己常常想，我宁愿用一大把金币去换十二打烟斗，或换一个磨谷的手磨。我甚至愿意用我全部的钱币去换价值仅六个便士的英国萝卜和胡萝卜种子，或者去换一把豆子或一片墨水。可是现在，那些金钱银币对我一点也没有用处，也毫无价值。它们放在一个抽屉里，而一到雨季，由于洞里潮湿，就会发霉。
<br> 
<br> 在这种情况下，即使我抽屉里堆满了钻石，对我来说也毫无价值，因为它们毫无用处。
<br> 
<br> 与当初上岛时相比，我已大大改善了自己的生活状况。我不仅生活舒适，而且心情也安逸。每当我坐下来吃饭，总会有一种感激之情，惊异上帝万能，竟然能在旷野为我摆设筵席。我已学会多看看自己生活中的光明面，少看看生活中的黑暗面；多想想自己所得到的享受，少想想所缺乏的东西。这种态度使我内心感到的由衷安慰，实难言表。在这儿，我写下这些话，就是希望那些不知满足的人能有所觉醒：他们之所以不能舒舒服服地享受上帝的恩赐，正是因为他们老是在期望和贪求他们还没有得到的东西。我感到，我们老是感到缺少什么东西而不满足，是因为我们对已经得到的东西缺少感激之情。
<br> 
<br> 还有一种想法对我也大有好处，而且，这种反省毫无疑问对遇到我这种灾难的其他任何人也一定大有用处。那就是拿我目前的情况跟我当初所预料的情况加以比较，或者不如说，跟我必然会遭遇的境况加以比较。上帝神奇地作出了目前这样的安排，把大船冲近海岸，让我不仅能靠近它，还能从上面取下所需要的东西搬到岸上，使我获得救济和安慰。假如不是这样，我就没有工具工作，没有武器自卫，没有弹药猎取食物了。
<br> 
<br> 我有时一连几小时，甚至好几天沉思冥想。我自己设想：假如我没能从船上取下任何东西，那将怎么办呢？假如那样，除了鳖外，我就找不到任何其他食物了；而鳖是很久之后才发现的，那么，我一定早就饿死了。即使不饿死，我也一定过着野人一样的生活，即使想方设法打死一只山羊或一只鸟，我也无法把它们开膛破肚，剥皮切块，而只好像野兽一样，用牙齿去咬，用爪子去撕了。
<br> 
<br> 这种想法使我深深地感到造物主对我的仁慈，尽管我当前的处境相当困苦不幸，但我还是充满了感激之情。在困苦中的人常常会哀叹："有谁像我这样苦啊！
<br> 
<br> "我劝他们好好读读我这段话，并好好想一想，有些人的情况比他们还要坏得多。还应想一想，假如造物主故意捉弄他们，他们的景况将会糟得多。
<br> 
<br> 此外，还有一种想法，使我心里充满了希望，从而内心获得极大的安慰。那就是，把我目前的境况与造物主应对我的报应加以比较。过去，我过着可怕的生活，对上帝完全缺乏认识和敬畏。我父母曾给我很好的教育，他们也尽力教导我应敬畏上帝，教育我应明白自己的责任，明白做人的目的和道理。可是，天哪，我很早就当了水手，过上了航海生活。
<br> 
<br> 要知道，水手是最不尊敬不畏惧上帝的人，尽管上帝使他们的生活充满了恐怖。由于我年轻时就过水手生活，与水手们为伍，我早年获得的那不多的宗教意识，早就从我的头脑里消失得一干二净了。这是由于伙伴们的嘲笑，由于经常遭遇危险而视死如归，由于没有与善良的人交往而从未听到有益的教导，因此本来就十分淡薄的宗教信仰，就消失殆尽了。
<br> 
<br> 那时，我完全没有善心，也不知道自己的为人，不知道该怎样做人；因此，即使上帝赐给我最大的恩惠，在我心里或嘴里却从未说过一句"感谢上帝"的话。譬如，我从萨累出逃，被葡萄牙船长从海上救起来，在巴西安身立命并获得发展，从英国运回我采购的货物，凡此种种，难道不都是上帝的恩赐吗？另一方面，当我身处极端危难之中时，我从不向上帝祈祷，也从不说一声"上帝可怜可怜我吧"。在我的嘴里，要是提到上帝的名字，那不是赌咒发誓，就是恶言骂人。
<br> 
<br> 正如前面提到的，一连好几个月，我对过去的罪恶生活一直进行着反省，心里感到非常害怕。但是，当我再看看自己目前的处境，想到自从到了这荒岛上之后，上帝给了我多少恩惠，对我多么仁慈宽厚，想到上帝不仅没有因我过去的罪恶生活惩罚我，反而处处照顾我，我心里不禁又充满了希望。我想，上帝已接受了我的忏悔，并且还会怜悯我。
<br> 
<br> 反省使我更坚定了对上帝的信念。我不但心平气和地接受了上帝对我当前处境的安排，甚至对现状怀着衷心的感激之情。我竟然没有受到惩罚而至今还活着，我不应该再有任何抱怨。我得到了许许多多的慈悲，而这些慈悲我是完全不应该期望能获得的。我绝不应该对自己的境遇感到不满，而是应该感到心满意足；我应该感谢每天有面包吃，因为我能有面包吃，完全是一系列的奇迹造成的。我感到，我是被奇迹养活着，这种奇迹是罕见的，就像以利亚被乌鸦养活一样。应该说，正是由于发生了一系列的奇迹，我至今还能活着。在世界上所有荒无人烟的地区，我感到没有一个地方会比我现在流落的荒岛更好了。虽说这儿远离人世，形单影只，使我非常苦恼，但这儿没有吃人的野兽，没有凶猛的虎狼害我性命，没有毒人的动物和植物，吃下去会把我毒死，更没有野人会把我杀了吃掉。
<br> 
<br> 总而言之，我的生活，在一方面看来，确是一种可悲的生活；在另一方面看来，却也是一种蒙恩的生活。我不再乞求任何东西，以使自己过上舒适的生活，我只希望自己能体会到上帝对我的恩惠，对我的关怀，使我时时能得到安慰。我这样提高了自己的认识，就会感到心满意足，不再悲伤了。
<br> 
<br> 我来到岛上已很久了。我从船里带上岸的许多东西不是用完了，就是差不多快用完了或用坏了。
<br> 
<br> 前面已经提到过，我的墨水早就用完了，到最后，只剩下一点点。我就不断加点水进去，直到后来淡得写在纸上看不出字迹了。但我决心只要还有点墨水，就要把每月中发生特殊事件的日子记下来。翻阅了一下日记，发现我所遭遇的各种事故，在日期上有某种巧合；如果我有迷信思想，认为时辰有凶吉，那我一定会感到无限的惊诧。
<br> 
<br> 首先，我前面已提到过，九月三十日，是我离家出走来到赫尔去航海的日子；我被萨累的海盗船俘虏而沦为奴隶的日期，也正好是同一天。
<br> 
<br> 其次，我从雅茅斯锚地的沉船中逃出来的那天，也正是后来我从萨累逃跑的那天，同月同日。
<br> 
<br> 我诞生于九月三十日；正是二十六年之后的这一天，我奇迹般地获救，流落到这荒岛上。所以，我的罪恶生活和我的孤单生活，可以说开始于同一个日子。
<br> 
<br> 除了墨水用完之外，"面包"也吃完了。这是指我从船上拿回来的饼干。我饼干吃得很省，一天只吃一块，维持了整整一年多时间。在收获到自己种的粮食之前，我还是断了一年的面包。后来，我可以吃到自己的面包了。对上帝真是感激不尽，因为，正如我前面所说的，我能吃到面包，真是奇迹中的奇迹！
<br> 
<br> 我的衣服也开始破烂不堪了。内衣我是早就没有了，剩下的就是从水手们的箱子里找到的几件花格子衬衫，那也是我舍不得穿而小心保存下来的。在这儿，大部分时间只能穿衬衫，穿不住别的衣服。还好在水手服装里有大约三打衬衫，这帮了我的大忙。另外，还有几件水手值夜穿的服装，那穿起来就太热了。虽然这里天气酷热，用不着穿衣服，但我总不能赤身裸体吧。即使我可以不穿衣服，我也不想这样做；这种念头我连想都不愿想一下，尽管岛上只有我孤孤单单一个人。
<br> 
<br> 我不能赤身裸体当然是有理由的。这儿阳光炽热，裸体晒太阳根本就受不了，不一会太阳就会把皮肤晒出泡来。穿上衣服就不同了，空气可以在下面流通，这比不穿衣服要凉快两倍。同时，在太阳底下不戴帽子也不行。这儿的太阳，热力难当，直接晒在头上，不一会儿就晒得头痛难熬。但如果戴上帽子，那就好多了。
<br> 
<br> 根据这些情况，我便开始考虑把那些破衣服整理一下。我所有的背心都已穿破了，所以我得做两件背心，布料就可以用水手值夜的衣服拆下来，再加上一些别的布料。于是我做起裁缝来。其实，我根本不懂缝纫工作，只是胡乱缝合起来罢了。我的手艺可以说是再糟也没有了。尽管如此，我还是勉强做成了两三件新背心，希望能穿一段时间。至于短裤，我直到后来才马马虎虎做出几条很不像样的东西。
<br> 
<br> 我前面提到过，凡是我打死的野兽，我都把毛皮保存起来，所谓野兽，我指的是四足动物。我把毛皮用棍子支在太阳下晒干，有的被晒得又干又硬，简直没有什么用处了；但有的倒还合用。我首先用这些毛皮做了顶帽子，把毛翻在外面，可以挡雨。帽子做得还可以，我就又用一些毛皮做了一套衣服，包括一件背心和一条长仅及膝的短裤。背心和短裤都做得非常宽大，因为它们主要是用来挡热的，而不是御寒的。当然，我不得不承认，不论是背心还是短裤，做得都很不像样，因为，如果说我的木匠手艺不行，那我的裁缝手艺就更糟了。话虽如此，我还是做好了，总算能够将就着穿。我外出时，若遇到下雨，把背心和帽子的毛翻在外面，就可挡雨，身上就不致淋湿。
<br> 
<br> 后来，我又花了不少时间和精力做了一把桑我非常需要一把伞，也一直想做一把。在巴西时，我曾见别人做过桑在巴西，天气炎热，伞是十分有用的。这儿的天气和巴西一样热，而且由于更靠近赤道，比巴西还热。此外，我还不得不经常外出，伞对我实在太有用了，遮荫挡雨都需要桑我历尽艰辛，花了不少时间，好不容易做成了一把。做伞确实不易，就是在我自以为找到诀窍之后，还是做坏了两三把，直到最后，总算做成一把勉强可用。我感到做伞的最大困难是要使伞能收起来。做一把撑开的伞不难，但如果不能收起来，就只能永远撑在头顶上，这种伞根本无法携带，当然不适用。
<br> 
<br> 最后，正如我上面说的，总算做成了一把，尚能差强人意。我用毛皮做伞顶，毛翻在外面，可以像一座小茅屋似地把雨挡住，并能挡住强烈的阳光。这样，即使在最热的天气，我也能外出，甚至比以往最凉的天气外出还要舒服。伞不用的时候，就可以折起来挟在胳膊下，携带十分方便。
<br> 
<br> 我现在生活得非常舒服，心情也非常舒畅；我悉听天命，听从上帝的旨意和安排。这样，我觉得我现在的生活比有交际的生活还要好。因为，每当我抱怨没有人可以交谈时，我便责问自己，同自己的思想交谈，并且，我想我可以说，通过祷告同上帝交谈，不是比世界上人类社会中的交际更好吗？
<br> 
<br> 此后五年，我的生活环境和生活方式基本上没有什么变化，也没有什么特别的事情发生。我的主要工作是，每年按时种大麦和稻子，晒葡萄干，并把这些东西贮藏起来，供我一年吃用；此外，就是天天带枪外出行猎。在此期间，除了这些日常工作外，我做的唯一一件大事就是给自己又造了一只独木舟，并最后确实也做成了。为了把独木舟引入半英里外的小河里，我挖了一条运河，有六英尺宽，四英尺深。先前做的那只实在太大，我始终无法把它放到水里去，也无法把水引到它下面来。这是由于我事先没有考虑到船造好后的下水问题，而这问题是我应该预先考虑到的。现在，那艘独木舟只能躺在原地留作纪念，教训我下一次应学得聪明些。这一次，我没能找到一棵较合适的树，而且，还需把水从半英里以外引过来。然而，当我看到有成功的希望时，就不愿放弃这一机会。虽然造成这条小舟花了将近两年的时间，我却从未偷懒或厌烦。我一直希望，迟早有一天我能坐上小船到海上去。
<br> 
<br> 我造的第一只独木舟是相当大的，因为我想用它渡到小岛对面的那块大陆上去，期间的距离约有四十海里。可是，现在新造的这艘船就太小了，不可能乘它渡过那么宽的海域，因而不符合我原先造船的意图。这样，我只好打消我原定的计划，不再去想它了。现在既然有了这只小舟，我的下一步计划就是坐上小船绕岛航行一圈。前面我曾提到，我曾经在陆上徒步横越小岛，抵达了岛的另一头。在那些小小的旅行中，我有不少新的发现，所以我一直想看看小岛沿岸的其他地区。
<br> 
<br> 现在，我既然有了小船，就可沿岛航行一周，实现我的宿愿了。
<br> 
<br> 为了实现环岛航行的目的，我要把样样事情做得既周到又慎重。为此，我在小船上安装了一根小小的桅杆，并用贮藏已久的帆布做了个帆。你们知道，我从大船上取下的帆布多得很，且一直放在那里没用过多少。
<br> 
<br> 安装好了桅杆和帆之后，我决定坐船试航一番，结果发现小船走得相当不错。于是，我在船的两头都做了小抽屉或者可以说是小盒子，里面放粮食、日用品和弹药之类的东西，免得给雨水或浪花打湿。另外，我又在船舷内挖了一条长长的槽，用来放枪，还做了块垂板可盖住长槽，以防枪支受潮。
<br> 
<br> 我又把我的那把伞安放在船尾的平台上。伞竖在那里，也像一根桅杆，伞顶张开，正好罩在我头上，挡住了太阳的势力，像个凉篷。此后，我常常坐上独木舟到海面上游荡，但从来不敢走远，也不敢离小河太远。后来，我急于想看看自己这个小小王国的边界，就决定绕岛航行一周。为此，我先往船上装粮食，装了两打大麦面包（其实不如叫大麦饼），又装了一满罐炒米（这是我吃得最多的粮食），一小片甘蔗酒，半只山羊肉，还有一些火药和子弹，准备用来打山羊。另外，我还拿出了两件水手值夜穿的衣服，这我前面也提到过，是我在水手箱子中找到的。这两件衣服放到船上，一件可以用来作铺被，一件用来作盖被。
<br> 
<br> 我成为这个岛国的国王已第六年了，或者说，我流落在这个荒岛已第六年了。反正怎么说都可以。在这第六年的十一月六日，我开始了这次环绕小岛的航行。这次航行所花的时间比我预料的要长得多，因为岛虽然不大，但当我航行到东头时，却被一大堆岩石挡住了航道。岩石向海里延伸，差不多有六海里远，这些礁石有的露出水面，有的藏在水下。礁石外面还有一片沙滩，约有一海里半宽。因此，我不得不把船开到远处的海面上，绕过这个岬角航行。
<br> 
<br> 一开始发现这些礁石时，我几乎想放弃这次航行，调转船头往回走，因为我不知道要向外海走多远，而且，我更怀疑自己能不能回到岛上。于是，我就下了锚--我用从船上取下来的一只破铁钩做了锚。
<br> 
<br> 我把船停稳当后，就带枪走上岸。我爬上一座可以俯视岬角的小山；在山顶上，我看清了岬角的全部长度，决定冒险继续前进。
<br> 
<br> 从我所站的小山上向海上放眼望去，看见有一股很强很猛的急流向东流去，差不多一直流到那岬角附近。我进一步仔细地观察了一下，因为我发现，这股急流中隐藏着危险。如果我把船开进这股急流，船就会被它冲到外海去，可能再也回不到岛上了。说真的，假如我没有先爬上这座山观察到这股急流，我相信一定会碰到这种危险的。因为，岛的那边也有一股同样的急流，不过离海岸较远，而且在海岸底下还有一股猛烈的回流；即使我能躲过第一股急流，也会被卷入回流中去。
<br> 
<br> 我在这儿把船停了两天，因为那两天一直刮东南风，风向偏东，而且风也不校风向正好与我上面提到的那股急流的方向相反，因而在岬角附近的海面波涛汹涌。在这种情况下，如果我靠近海岸航行，就会碰到大浪，如果我远离海岸航行，又会碰到急流，所以怎么走都不安全。
<br> 
<br> 第三天早晨，海上风平浪静，因为在夜里风已大大减小了。于是我又冒险前进。可是一开船，我又犯了个大错误，足以给那些鲁莽而无知的水手作为前车之鉴。船刚走近那个岬角，离海岸还没有船本身的长度那么远，就开进了一片深水面，并且碰上一股激流，就像磨坊下的水流那么急。这股激流来势凶猛，把我的船一直向前冲去。我费了九牛二虎之力，想让船沿着这股激流的边沿前进，可是毫无用处。结果，我的船远远冲离了我左边的那股回流。这时又正好没有一点风。
<br> 
<br> 我只得拼命划桨，但还是无济于事。我感到自己这下子又要完蛋了。因为我知道，这岛的两头都各有一股急流，它们必然会在几海里以外汇合，到那时，我是必死无疑了，而且我也看不出有什么办法可以逃过这场灭顶之灾。现在，除了死亡，我已没有任何希望--倒不是我会葬身鱼腹，因为这时海面上风平浪静，而是会活活饿死，因为没有东西吃。不错，我曾在岸上抓到一只大鳖，重得几乎拿都拿不动。我把鳖扔进了船里。此外，我还有一大罐子淡水。但是，如果我被冲进汪洋大海，周围没有海岸，没有大陆，也没有小岛，我这么一点点食物和淡水又有什么用呢？
<br> 
<br> 现在我才明白，只要上帝有意安排，它可以把人类最不幸的境遇变得更加不幸。现在我感到，我那荒凉的孤岛是世上最可爱的地方，而我现在最大的幸福，就是重新回到我那荒岛上。我怀着热切的心愿向它伸出双手："幸福荒芜的小岛啊，
<br> 
<br> "我说，"我将永远看不到你了！"然后，我又对自己说："你这倒霉的家伙，你将去何方？"我开始责备自己身在福中不知福的脾气，责备自己不应该抱怨孤独的生活。现在，我愿意付出任何代价，只要能让我重新回到岸上！可是，我们一般凡人，不亲自经历更恶劣的环境，就永远看不到自己原来所处环境的优越性；不落到山穷水尽的地步，就不懂得珍惜自己原来享受的一切。我眼看自己被冲进茫茫的大海，离开我那可爱的小岛有六海里多远--现在我从心底里感到我的小岛确实可爱无比。看到我已没有回岛的希望，内心的惶恐简直难以形容。但是，我还是竭力划桨，直到筋疲力尽为止。我尽量把船朝北面划去，也就是向那股急流和回流交汇的海面划去。到了正午，太阳过了子午线，我忽然感到脸上似乎有了一点微风，风向东南偏南。我心中悄悄燃起了希望；尤其令人振奋的是，过了半小时，风稍稍大起来。这时我离岛已经很远了，要是这时有一点阴云或薄雾，那我也必完蛋无疑。因为我未带罗盘，只要我看不到海岛，我就会迷失方向无法回去。幸好天气始终晴朗，我立即竖起桅杆，张帆向北驶去，尽量躲开那股急流。
<br> 
<br> 我刚竖起桅杆张好帜，船就开始向前行驶了。我发现四周水色较清，知道那股急流在附近改变了方向。因为，水急水则浊，水缓水则清，我知道那股急流在这儿已成了强弩之末了。不久我果然发现，在半海里以外，海水打在一些礁石上，浪花四溅。那些礁石把这股急流分成两股，主要的一股继续流向南方，另一股被礁石挡回，形成一股强烈的回流，向西北流回来，水流湍急。
<br> 
<br> 假如有人在临上绞架时忽然得到赦免，或者正要被强盗谋害时忽然获救，或者有过类似的死里逃生的经历，就不难体会到我当时那种喜出望外的心情，也不难设想我把船驶进那股回流是多么欣喜若狂。平时，正当风顺水急，我张帆乘风破浪向前，那欢快的心情是不难想像的。
<br> 
<br> 这股回流一直把我往岛上的方向冲了约三海里，但与先前把我冲向海外的那股急流相距六海里多，方向偏北。因此，当我靠近海岛时，发现自己正驶向岛的北岸，而我这次航行出发的地方是岛的南岸。
<br> 
<br> 这股回流把我冲向海岛方向三海里之后，它的力量已成了强弩之末，再也不能把船向前推进了。我发现自己正处于两股激流之间--一股在南面，也就是把我冲走的那股急流，一股在北面，两股激流之间相距约三海里。我刚才说，我正好处于两股激流之间，且已靠近小岛。这儿海面平静，海水没有流动的样子，而且还有一股顺风。我就乘风向岛上驶去，但船行慢得多了。
<br> 
<br> 大约下午四点钟，在离海岛不到三海里的地方，我看到了伸向南方的岬角，这一点我前面也已提到过。正是这堆礁石引发了这次祸端。岬角把急流进一步向南方逼去，同时又分出一股回流向北方流去。这股回流流得很急，一直向正北。
<br> 
<br> 这不是我要航行的方向，我的航线是要往西走。由于风还大，我就从斜里穿过这股回流，向西北插过去。一小时之后，离岛只有一海里了，且这一带海面平静，所以不久我便上了岸。
<br> 
<br> 上岸之后，我立即跪在地上，感谢上帝搭救我脱离大难，并决心放弃坐小船离开孤岛的一切胡思乱想。我吃了一些所带的东西，就把小船划进岸边的一个小湾里藏在树底下。接着，我就躺在地上睡着了。这次航行把我弄得筋疲力竭，既辛苦又困乏。
<br> 
<br> 我完全不知道该怎样驾船回家。我遇到了这么多危险，知道照原路回去是十分危险的，而海岛的另一边，也就是西边的情况，我又一无所知，更无心再去冒险。所以，我决定第二天早晨沿海岸西行，看看能不能找到一条小河停泊我的小战舰，以便需要的时候再来取它。我驾船沿岸行驶约三海里，找到了一个小湾，约一英里宽，愈往里愈窄，最后成了一条小溪。这对于我的小船倒是一个进出方便的港口，就仿佛是专门为它建立的小船坞似的。我把小船停放妥当后，便上了岸。我环顾四周，看看到底到了什么地方。
<br> 
<br> 我很快就发现，这儿离我上次徒步旅行所到过的地方不远。所以，我只从船上拿出了枪和伞（因为天气很热）就出发了。经过这次辛劳而又危险的航行之后，我感到在陆上旅行十分轻松愉快。傍晚，我就到了自己的茅舍。屋里一切如132旧，因为这是我的乡间别墅，我总是把一切都收拾得整整齐齐的。
<br> 
<br> 我爬过围墙，躺在树荫下歇歇腿。我实在太疲倦了，不久就昏昏沉沉睡着了。不料，忽然有一个声音叫着我的名字，把我从睡梦中惊醒："鲁宾！鲁宾！鲁滨·克罗索！可怜的鲁滨·克罗索！你在哪儿，鲁滨·克罗索？你在哪儿？你去哪儿啦？"亲爱的读者，你们不妨想想，这多么出乎我的意料啊！
<br> 
<br> 开始我睡得很熟，因为上半天一直在划船，下半天又走了不少路，所以困乏极了。突然，我被惊醒，但人一下子还未完全清醒过来，只是处于半睡半醒之中，因此我以为在睡梦中有人在同我说话。但那声音不断地叫着"鲁宾·克罗索！
<br> 
<br> 鲁宾·克罗索！"终于使我完全清醒过来。这一醒，把我吓得心胆俱裂，一骨碌从地上爬起。我睁眼一看，原来是我的那只鹦鹉停在篱笆上面。啊，原来是它在和我说话呢！这些令人伤心的话，正是我教它说的，也是我常和它说的话。它已把这些话学得维妙维肖了，经常停在我的手指头上，把它的嘴靠近我的脸，叫着"可怜的鲁宾·克罗索，你在哪儿？你去哪儿啦？你怎么会流落到这儿来的？"以及其它我教给它的一些话。
<br> 
<br> 可是，我明明知道刚才跟我说话的是我的鹦鹉，不是别人，可还是过了好一会儿心神才定下来。首先我感到奇怪，这小鸟怎么会飞到这儿来？其次，为什么它老守在这儿，不到别处去？但在我确实弄清楚与我说话的不是别人，而是我那忠实的鹦鹉后，心就定下来了。我伸出手来，向它叫了一声"波儿"，这只会说话的小岛便像往常一样，飞到我的大拇指上，接连不断地对我叫着"可怜的鲁宾·克罗索，"并问我"怎么到这儿来啦？""到哪儿去啦？"仿佛很高兴又见到我似的。于是我就带着它回城堡的老家去了。
<br> 
<br> 我在海上飘流了那么长时间，实在够受的了，现在正好安安静静地休息几天，回味一下所经历过的危险。我很想把小船弄回海岛的这一边来，也就是我的住所这一边，但想不出切实可行的办法。至于岛的东边，我已经去过那儿，知道不能再去冒险了。一想到这次经历，我就胆战心惊，不寒而栗。而岛的西边，我对那儿的情况一无所知。如果那边也有像东边那样的急流猛烈地冲击着海岸，就会碰到同样的危险，我也会被卷进急流，像上次那样给冲到海里去。想到这些，我便决心不要那小船了，尽管我花了好几个月的辛勤劳动才把它做成，又花了好几个月的工夫引它下水进入海里。
<br> 
<br> 差不多有一年的工夫，我压制着自己的性子，过着一种恬静优闲的生活，这一点你们完全可以想象。我安于自己的境遇，安于上天对我的安排，因此，我感到生活十分幸福。唯一的缺陷是，没有人可以交往。
<br> 
<br> 在此期间，为了应付生活的需要，我的各种技艺都有长足的进步。我相信，总有一天，我会成为一个手艺出色的木匠，尤其是工具缺乏的条件下，我也能有所作为。
<br> 
<br> 此外，令人难以意料的是，我的陶器也做得相当完美。我想出了一个好方法，用一只轮盘来制造陶器，做起来又容易又好看。现在我做出来的器皿又圆又有样子，而过去做出来的东西看了也叫人恶心。但使我感到最自豪最高兴的是，居然还做成功了一只烟斗。尽管我做出来的这只烟斗又粗劣又难看，并且烧得和别的陶器一样红，可是却坚实耐用，烟管也抽得通。这对于我是个莫大的安慰，因为我有的是烟叶。当时，船上虽然也有几只烟斗，但我起初忘了带下来，不知道岛上也长有烟叶；后来再到船上去找，却一只也找不到了。
<br> 
<br> 在编制藤皮方面，我也有不少进步，并且运用我全部匠心，编了不少自己需要的筐子，虽然不太雅观，倒也方便实用。这些筐子或是用来放东西，或是用来运东西回家。例如，我外出打死了山羊，就把死羊吊在树上剥皮挖肚，再把肉切成一块块装在筐子里带回家。同样，有时我抓到一只鳖，也随即杀了，把蛋取出来，再切下一两块肉，装在筐子里带回来，余下的肉就丢弃不要了，因为带回去多了也吃不掉。此外，我又做了一些又大又深的筐子来盛谷物。谷物收获后，一等谷物干透，就搓出来晒干，然后装在筐子里贮藏起来。
<br> 
<br> 我现在开始发现我的火药已大大减少了，这是无法补充的必需品。我开始认真考虑不用弹药猎山羊的问题，也就是用什么办法捕获山羊。前面我也曾提到，上岛第三年，我捉到了一只雌的小山羊，经过驯养，它长大了。后来，我一直想再活捉一只雄山羊与它配对；可是想尽办法也没能抓到一只。到最后，小山羊成了老山羊，我怎么也不忍心杀它，直至它老死。
<br> 
<br> 现在我已在岛上生活了十一年。前面也已说过，我的弹药越来越少了。于是我开始研究如何用陷阱或夹子捕捉山羊，看看能否活捉它一两只；我特别希望能抓到一只怀孕的母羊。
<br> 
<br> 为此，我做了几只夹子来捕捉山羊。我确信有好几次山羊曾被夹子夹住了，但是，由于没有铅丝之类的金属线，夹子做得不理想，结果发现它们总是吃掉诱饵弄坏夹子后逃之夭夭。
<br> 
<br> 最后，我决定挖陷阱试试看。于是，我在山羊经常吃草的地方掘了几个大陷坑，在坑上盖上几块自制木条格子，再在上面压了一些很重的东西。开始几次，我在复盖好的陷坑上面放了一些大麦穗子和干米，但有意未装上机关。我一看就知道，山羊曾走进去吃过谷物，因为上面留下了它们的脚樱末了，有一天晚上，我一下子在三个陷阱里都安了机关。
<br> 
<br> 第二天早晨跑去一看，只见食饵都给吃掉了，可三个机关都没有动。这真使人丧气。于是，我改装了机关。具体我不再细说了。总而言之，有一天早上我去看看陷阱，结果发现在一个陷阱里扣着一只老公羊，另一个陷阱里扣着三只小羊，其中一只是公羊，两只是母羊。
<br> 
<br> 对那只老公羊我毫无办法。它凶猛异常，我不敢下坑去捉它。我是想抓活的，这也是我的目的。当然我也可以把它杀死，但我不想那么做，因为那不是我的意愿。所以我只好把它放走了。老山羊一跑出陷坑，便像吓掉魂一样一溜烟逃跑了。当时我没有想到，就是一头狮子，也可以用饥饿的办法把它驯服，但这只是到后来我才懂得了这个办法。如果我让那头老山羊在陷阱里饿上三四天，不给它吃东西，然后，再稍稍给它点水喝，给它点谷物吃，它也一定会像那些小山羊一样驯服。只要饲养得法，山羊是十分伶俐、十分容易驯养的。
<br> 
<br> 可是，当时我并不知道有什么好办法，所以只好把老山羊放走了。然后，我就到小山羊的陷坑里，一只只把它们捉起来，再用绳子把它们拴在一起，又费了不少力气才把它们牵回家。
<br> 
<br> 小山羊好久都不肯吃东西。后来，我给它们吃一些谷粒，因为味道甜美，它们很喜欢吃，就慢慢驯顺起来。现在我知道，如果弹药用尽之后还想吃山羊肉，唯一的办法就是驯养一些山羊。将来也许会在我屋子周围有一大群山羊呢！
<br> 
<br> 目前，我首先想到的是，必须把驯养的山羊与野山羊隔离弃来。否则，驯养的小山羊一长大，就会跑掉又变成野山羊。而要把驯养的山羊与野山羊隔离，唯一的办法是找一块空地，用坚固的篱笆或木栅栏圈起来。这样，里面的驯羊出不来，外面的野羊进不去。
<br> 
<br> 我孤身一人，要圈地修筑篱笆无疑是一项巨大的工程，可这样做又是绝对必要的。所以，我首先得找到一块合适的地方，那儿既要有青草供山羊吃，又要有水供它们喝，并且还要有荫凉的地方供它们歇息。
<br> 
<br> 我找到了一个十分合适的地方，以上三个条件样样具备。
<br> 
<br> 这是一大片平坦的草原，也就是西部殖民者所说的热带或亚热带那种树木稀疏的草原。草原上有两三条小溪，水流清澈，小溪尽头有不少树木。但凡是有圈地经验的人，一定会认为我这种做法缺少计算，如果我把自己原来的想法告诉他们，他们也一定会笑话我。这不仅因为我的圈地规模过大，如果要把篱笆或木栅栏修筑起来，至少有两英里长！其实，篱笆长短还在其次，即使十英里长我也有工夫将它完成，主要还是圈地范围过大所带来的后果。当时我没有考虑到，山羊在这么宽广的范围内，一定会到处乱跑，就像没有围起来一样。如果要捕捉它们，就根本无法抓到。
<br> 
<br> 我开始动手修筑篱笆，但直到完成了大约五十码时，才想到了上面提到的问题。于是我立即停工，并决定先圈一块长约一百五十码，宽约一百码的地方。这个面积，在相当一段时期内，足以容纳我能驯养的山羊；等以后羊群增加了，我可以进一步扩大圈地。
<br> 
<br> 这个办法较为审慎可行，我就鼓起勇气重新动手干起来。
<br> 
<br> 这第一块圈地用了差不多三个月的时间才完成。在此期间，我一直把三只小羊拴在最好的地方，并让它们一直在我近旁吃草，使它们与我混熟。我还经常用大麦穗子和一把把大米喂它们，让它们在我手里吃。这样，当我把篱笆修筑完成之后，即使把它们放开，也会回来跟着我转，并咩咩叫着向我讨吃哩！
<br> 
<br> 我的目的总算实现了。不到一年半，我已连大带小有了十二只山羊了。又过了两年，除了被我宰杀吃掉的几只不算，我已有了四十三只了。这以后，我又圈了五六块地方养羊。在这些圈地上，都做了窄小的围栏；我要捉羊时，就把羊赶进去。同时，在各圈地之间，又做了一些门使之彼此相通。这还不算，现在我不仅随时有羊肉吃，还有羊奶喝。这在当初我根本想也没有想到。所以我忽然想到可以喝羊奶时，真是喜出望外。现在，我有了自己的挤奶房，有时每天可产一两加仑的羊奶。我这人一生没有挤过牛奶，更没有挤过羊奶，也没有见过人家做奶油或乳酪。可是，经过多次的试验和失败，我终于做出了奶油和干酪，而且做得方便利索。可见大自然不但使每个生灵都得到食物，而且还自然而然地教会他们如何充分地利用各种食物。
<br> 
<br> 造物主对待自己所创造的一切生灵是多么仁慈啊，哪怕他们身处绝境，他也还是那么慈悲为怀。他能把苦难的命运变得甜蜜，即使我们囚于牢狱也都要赞美他！当我刚来到这片荒野时，一定以为自己会饿死；而现在，摆在我面前是多么丰盛的筵席啊！
<br> 
<br> 你如果是一个信奉斯多葛哲学的人，看到我和我的小家庭成员共进晚餐的情景，也一定会忍俊不禁。我坐在中间，俨然是全岛的君王。我对自己的臣民拥有绝对的生杀之权。我可以任意处置我的臣民，要杀就杀，要抓就抓，要放就放，而且不会有反叛者。
<br> 
<br> 再看看我是怎样用餐的吧！我一个人坐在那儿进餐，其他都是我的臣民在一旁侍候。我的鹦鹉仿佛是我的宠臣，只有它才被允许与我讲话。我的狗现在已又老又昏聩了，它总是坐在我右手；而那两只猫则各坐一边，不时地希望从我手里得到一点赏赐，并把此视为一种特殊的恩宠。
<br> 
<br> 这两只猫已不是我最初从破船上带下来的了，那两只早就死了，我亲自把它们葬在我的住所附近。不过其中一只不知同什么动物交配，生下了许多小猫。这两只就是我从那些小猫中留下来驯养起来的，其余的都跑到树林里成了野猫。那些野猫后来给我添了不少麻烦，因为它们经常跑到我家里来劫掠我的东西。最后我不得不开枪杀了它们一大批，终于把它们赶走了。所以，我现在有那么多仆人侍候我，生活也过得很富裕，唯一缺乏的就是没有人可以交往而已，其它什么都不缺。但不久之后，我就有人交往了，后来甚至感到交往的人太多了。
<br> 
<br> 我曾经说过，我非常希望能使用那只小船，但又不想再次冒险。因此，有时我会坐着苦思冥想，竭力设法把船弄到小岛的这边来；有时我又会安下心来，觉得不要它也行。可是我这人生性不安于现状，总是想到我上次出游时到过的海岛的那一边走一趟，看看有没有办法把小船弄过来，因为，正是在那儿，我可以登上小山，远眺海岸和潮水的流向。这念头在心里变得越来越强烈，最后终于决定沿着海岸从陆上走到那边去。于是我就出发了。如果在英国有人碰到我这样的人，一定会吓一大跳，再不然也会大笑一阵。我也常常停下来打量自己，想到自己如果穿这套行装，像这样打扮在约克郡旅行，也禁不住笑起来。下面我把自己的模样描绘一下吧。
<br> 
<br> 我头上戴着一顶山羊皮做的便帽，这帽子做得又高又大，很不像样，后面还垂着一条长长的帽缘，一来是为了遮太阳，二来是为了挡雨，免得雨水流进脖子。在热带，被雨淋湿是最伤身体的。
<br> 
<br> 我上身穿了一件山羊皮做的短外套，衣襟遮住了一半大腿。下身穿了一条齐膝短裤，也是用一只老公羊的皮做成的，两旁的羊毛一直垂到小腿上，看上去象条长裤。我没有鞋子，也没有袜子，但做了一双短靴似的东西，自己也不知道该叫什么，靴长刚及小腿，两边再用绳子系起来，好像绑腿一样。
<br> 
<br> 这双靴子与我身上的其他装束一样，极端拙劣难看。
<br> 
<br> 我腰间束了一条宽阔的皮带，那是用晒干了的小羊皮做的，皮带没有搭扣，只用两根山羊皮条系着。带子两边有两个搭环，原来是水手用来挂短刀或短剑的，可我挂了一把小锯和一把斧头，一边一把。另一条较窄的皮带，斜挂在我的肩膀上，也用皮条系着。这条皮带的末端，在我左胳膊下，挂着两个山羊皮袋，一个装火药，一个装子弹。我背上背着筐子，肩上扛着枪，头上撑着一顶羊皮做的大阳伞，样子又难看又笨拙。尽管如此，除了枪之外，这把伞也是我随身不可缺少的东西。至于我的脸，倒不像穆拉托人那么黑，看上去像一个住在赤道九度、十度之内的热带地区那种不修边幅的人。我的胡子曾长到四分之一码长，但我有的是剪刀和剃刀，所以就把它剪短了，但上嘴唇的胡子仍留着，并修剪成像回教徒式的八字大胡子，像我在萨累见到的土耳其人留的胡子那样，因为摩尔人是不留这种胡子的，只有土耳其人才留。我不敢说我的这副胡子长得可以挂我的帽子，但确实又长又大，要是在英国给人看见，准会吓得一大跳。
<br> 
<br> 不过，关于我的这副模样，只是顺便提提罢了，因为根本没有人会看到，我模样如何就无关紧要了，所以我也不必多费笔墨。我就带着这副尊容出发，一直走了五六天。我先沿海岸走到我上次泊船登上小山的地方。这次我用不着照管小船，就抄近路走上前次登过的那座小山岗。当我远眺伸入海中的岬角时，前面我曾提到、前次到达这儿时我不得不驾船绕道而行，但现在只见海面风平浪静，那儿既没有波澜，也大出乎我的意料。
<br> 
<br> 对这个现象我感到莫明其妙，决心花些时间留心观察一下，看看是否与潮水方向有关。不久我就明白了其中的奥妙。
<br> 
<br> 原来，从西边退下来的潮水与岸上一条大河的水流汇合，形成了那股急流；而西风或北风的强度又决定了那股急流离岸的远近。等到傍晚，我重新登上小山顶。当时正值退潮，我又清楚地看到了那股急流。只不过这一次离岸较远，约在一海里半处；而我上次来时，急流离岸很近，结果把我的独木舟冲走了。在别的时候，也许不会发生这种情况。
<br> 
<br> 这次观察使我确信，只要注意潮水的涨落，我可以很容易把小船弄到我住地所在的那一边。但当我想把自己的主意付诸实施的时候，又想到了上次所经历的危险，不由心惊肉跳，连想也不敢想了。于是，我作了一个新的决定，那就是再造一条独木舟。这样，我在岛的这边有一只，岛的那边也有一只。这样做虽然比较费力，但却比较安全。
<br> 
<br> 你们要知道，现在我在岛上已有了两个庄园--我也许可以这么称呼我的两处住所。一处是我的那个小小的城堡或帐篷。这儿，在小山脚下，四周建起了围墙，后面是一个岩洞，现在，岩洞已扩大成好几个房间，或者说好几个洞室，一个套着一个。其中有一间最干燥最宽大，并有一个门通到围墙外面，或者说是城堡外面。也就是说，通到了围墙和山石的连接处。在这一间里，我放满了前面提到过的那些陶土烧制成的大瓦缸，还放了十四五只大筐子，每只大筐子能装五六浦式耳粮食，主要装的是谷物。有的筐子装着直接从茎秆上摘下来的穗子，有的装着我用手搓出来的谷粒。
<br> 
<br> 那堵围墙我当时是用高大的树桩筑成的；现在，这些树桩已长成了树，又大又密，谁都看不出后面会住人。
<br> 
<br> 靠近住所，往岛内走几步，在一片地势较低的地方，有两块庄稼地。我按时耕种，按时收获。如果我需要更多的粮食，毗邻还有不少同样相宜的土地可以扩大。
<br> 
<br> 此外，在我的乡间别墅那边，现在也有一座像样的庄园。
<br> 
<br> 首先，我有一间茅舍。这间茅舍还不断加以修理。也就是说，我经常修剪周围的树篱，使其保持一定的高度。我的梯子也一直放在树篱里面。那些树起初只不过是一些树桩，现在却长得又粗又高了。我不断修剪树桩，希望能长得枝多叶茂，生机勃勃。后来，这些树真的长得蔚然成荫，令我十分称心如意。树篱中央，则搭着一顶帐篷。帐篷是用一块帆布做成的，由几根柱子支撑着，永远不必修理或重搭。帐篷下放了一张睡榻，那是我用兽皮和其他一些柔软的材料做成的；那些兽皮当然是我从打死了的野兽身上剥下来的。睡榻上还铺了一条毛毯，是我从船上的卧具中拿下来的；另外还有一件很大的值夜衣服用作盖被。我每次有事离开我的老住所时，就住在这座乡间别墅里。
<br> 
<br> 与别墅毗邻的是我的圈地，里面放养着山羊。当初，为了圈这块地，我曾历尽艰辛。我竭尽全力，把篱笆做得十分严密，免得圈在里面的山羊逃出去。我不遗余力，辛勤劳作，在篱笆外插满了小木桩，而且插得又密又多，样子不像篱墙，倒像是一个栅栏；在木桩与木桩之间，连手都插不进去。后来，在第三个雨季中，这些小木桩都长大了，成了一堵坚固的围墙，甚至比围墙还坚固。
<br> 
<br> 这一切都可以证明我并没有偷懒。为了使生活舒适，凡是必须做的事，我都会不辞辛劳地去完成。我认为，手边驯养一批牲畜，就等于替自己建立一座羊肉、羊奶、奶油和奶酪的活仓库。无论我在岛上生活多少年--那怕是四十年--也将取之不尽，用之不竭。同时，我也认为，要想一伸手就能抓到这些山羊，就得把羊圈修筑得十分严密，绝不能让它们到处乱跑。我把这个主意彻底实施，结果把木桩插得太密了，等它们长大后，我还不得不拔掉一些呢！在这里，我还种了一些葡萄，我每年冬天贮藏的葡萄干，主要是从自己葡萄园里收获的葡萄晒制而成的。这些葡萄干我都小心保藏，因为这是我现有食物中最富营养最可口的食品。葡萄干不仅好吃，而且营养丰富，祛病提神，延年益寿。
<br> 
<br> 我的乡间别墅正处于我泊船的地方和我海边住所的中途，因此每次去泊船处我总要在这里停留一下。我常去看看那条独木舟，并把船里的东西整理得井井有条。有时我也驾起独木舟出去消遣消遣，但我再也不敢离岸太远冒险远航了，唯恐无意中被急流、大风或其他意外事故把我冲走或刮走。然而，正在这时我生活却发生了新的变化。
<br> 
<br> 一天中午，我正走去看我的船，忽然在海边上发现一个人的脚印；那是一个赤脚的脚印，清清楚楚地印在沙滩上。这简直把我吓坏了。我呆呆地站在那里，犹如挨了一个晴天霹雳，又像大白天见到了鬼。我侧耳倾听，又环顾四周，可什么也没有听到，什么也没有见到。我跑上高地，向远处眺望，又在海边来回跑了几趟，可还是毫无结果。脚印就这一个，再也找不到其他脚樱我跑到脚印前，看看还有没有别的脚印，看看它是不是我自己的幻觉。可是，脚印就是脚印，而且就这么一个，不容置疑。脚趾头、脚后跟，是一个完整的脚樱可这脚印是怎么在这儿留下来的呢？我无法知道，也无从猜测。这使我心烦意乱，像一个精神失常的人那样，头脑里尽是胡思乱想，后来就拔腿往自己的防御工事跑去，一路飞奔，脚不沾地。可是，我心里又惶恐至极，一步三回头，看看后面有没有人追上来，连远处的一丛小树，一枝枯树干，都会使我疑神疑鬼，以为是人。一路上，我是惊恐万状，头脑里出现各种各样的幻景，幻觉里又出现各种各样荒诞不经的想法以及无数离奇古怪的妄想，简直一言难荆我一跑到自己的城堡--以后我就这样称呼了--一下子就钻了进去，好像后面真的有人在追赶似的。至于我是按原来的想法，用梯子爬进去的呢，还是从我打通了的岩洞的门里钻进去的，连自己都记不得了，甚至到了第二天早上也想不起来。因为，我跑进这藏身之所时，心里恐怖已极，就是一只受惊的野兔逃进自己的草窝里，一只狐狸逃进自己的地穴里，也没有像我这样胆颤心惊。
<br> 
<br> 我一夜都没合眼。时间越长，我的疑惧反而越大。这似乎有点反常，也不合乎受惊动物正常的心理状态。原来主要是因为我自己大惊小怪，因而引起一连串的胡思乱想，结果自己吓自己；而且，想的时间越长，越是都往坏处想。有时候，我幻想着，那定是魔鬼在作祟；于是，我的理智便随声附和，支持我的想法。我想，其他人怎么会跑到那儿去呢？把他们送到岛上来的船在哪里呢？别的脚印又在什么地方呢？一个人又怎么可能到那边去呢？但是，再一想，要是说魔鬼在那儿显出人形，仅仅是为了留下一个人的脚印，那又未免毫无意义，因为我未必一定会看到它。我想，魔鬼若为了吓吓我，可以找到许多其它办法，何必留下这个孤零零的脚印呢？
<br> 
<br> 何况我住在岛的另一头，魔鬼绝不会头脑如此简单，把一个记号留在我十有八九看不到的地方，而且还留在沙滩上，因为只要一起大风，就会被海潮冲得一干二净。这一切看来都不能自圆其说，也不符合我们对魔鬼的一般看法，在我们眼里，魔鬼总是十分乖巧狡猾的。
<br> 
<br> 所有这一切都使我不得不承认，我害怕那是魔鬼的作为是毫无根据的。因此，我马上得出一个结论：那一定是某种更危险的生物，也就是说，一定是海岛对岸大陆上的那些野人来跟我作对。他们划着独木舟在海上闲游，可能卷入了急流，或碰上逆风，偶尔冲到或刮到海岛上。上岸后又不愿留在这孤岛上，又回到了海上，要不我该发现他们了。
<br> 
<br> 当上述种种想法在我头脑里萦回时，我起初还庆幸自己当时没有在那边，也没有给他们发现我的小船。要是他们真的看到了小船，就会断定这小岛上有人，说不定会来搜寻我。
<br> 
<br> 可是，我又胡思乱想起来，出现了一些恐怖的念头。我想，他们可能已发现了我的小船，并且也已发现这岛上有人。又想，如果这样，他们一定会来更多的人把我吃掉；即使他们找不到我，也一定会发现我的围墙。那样，他们就会把我的谷物通通毁掉，把我驯养的山羊都劫走；最后，我只好活活饿死。
<br> 
<br> 恐惧心驱走了我全部的宗教信仰。在此之前，我亲身感受到上帝的恩惠，使我产生了对上帝的信仰；现在，这种信仰完全消失了。过去，上帝用神迹赐给我食物；而现在，我似乎认为他竟无力来保护他所赐给我的食物了。于是，我责备自己贪图安逸的生活，不肯多种一些粮食，只图能接得上下一季吃的就算了，好像不会发生什么意外似的，认为我一定能享用地里收获的谷物。这种自我谴责是有道理的，所以我决定以后一定要屯积好两三年的粮食。这样，无论发生什么事，也不致于因缺乏粮食而饿死。
<br> 
<br> 天命难测，使人生显得多么光怪陆离，变化无穷啊！在不同的环境下，人的感情又怎样变幻无常啊！我们今天所爱的，往往是我们明天所恨的；我们今天所追求的，往往是我们明天所逃避的；我们今天所希翼的，往往是我们明天所害怕的，甚至会吓得胆战心惊。现在，我自己就是一个生动的例子。以前，我觉得，我最大的痛苦是被人类社会所抛弃，孤身一人，被汪洋大海所包围，与人世隔绝，被贬黜而过着寂寞的生活。仿佛上天认定我不足与人类为伍，不足与其他人交往似的。我当时觉得，假如我能见到一个人，对我来说不亚于死而复生，那将是上帝所能赐给我的最大的幸福，这种幸福仅次于上帝饶恕我在人间所犯的罪孽，让我登上天堂。而现在呢，只要疑心可能会看到人，我就会不寒而栗；只要见到人影，看到人在岛上留下的脚印无声无息地躺在那里，我就恨不得地上有个洞让我钻下去。
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 人生就是这么变幻无常。我惊魂甫定之后，产生了关于人生的离奇古怪的想法。我认识到，我当前的境遇，正是大智大仁的上帝为我安排的。我既然无法预知天命，就该服从上帝的绝对权威。因为，我既然是上帝创造的，他就拥有绝对的权力按照他的旨意支配我和处置我；而我自己又曾冒犯过他，他当然有权力给我任何惩罚，这是合情合理的。我自己也理所当然地应接受他的惩罚，因为我对上帝犯了罪。
<br> 
<br> 于是，我又想到，既然公正而万能的上帝认为应该这样惩罚我，他当然也有力量拯救我。如果上帝认为不应该拯救我，我就应该认命，绝对地、毫无保留地服从上帝的旨意；同时，我也应该对上帝寄予希望，向他祈祷，静静地听候他圣意的吩咐和指示。
<br> 
<br> 我就这样苦思冥想，花去了许多小时，许多天，甚至许多星期，许多个月。思考的结果，在当时对我产生了一种特殊的影响，不能不在这里提一下。那就是：一天清晨，我正躺在床上想着野人出现的危险，心里觉得忐忑不安。这时，我忽然想到《圣经》上的话："你在患难的时候呼求我，我就必拯救你，而你要颂赞我。
<br> 
<br> "于是，我愉快地从床上爬起来，不仅心里感到宽慰多了，而且获得了指引和鼓舞，虔诚地向上帝祈祷，恳求他能拯救我。做完祈祷之后，我就拿起《圣经》翻开来，首先就看到下面这句话："等候上帝，要刚强勇敢，坚定你的意志，等候上帝！"这几句话给我的安慰，非语言所能形容。于是，我放下《圣经》，心里充满了感激之情，也不再忧愁哀伤，至少当时不再难过了。
<br> 
<br> 我就这样一会儿胡猜乱想，一会儿疑神疑鬼，一会儿又反省冥思。忽然有一天，我觉得这一切也许全是我自己的幻觉。那只脚印可能是我下船上岸时自己留在沙滩上的。这个想法使我稍稍高兴了一些，并竭力使自己相信，那确实是自己的幻觉，那只不过是自己留下的脚印而已。因为，我既然可以从那儿上船，当然也可以从那儿下船上岸。更何况，我自己也无法确定哪儿我走过，哪儿我没走过。如果最终忽略别的事情。我仍十分关心我的羊群，它们随时可以充分满足我的需要，使我不必浪费火药和子弹，也省得费力气去追捕野山羊。我当然不愿放弃自己驯养山羊所提供的便利，免得以后再从头开始驯养。
<br> 
<br> 为此，我考虑良久，觉得只有两个办法可以保全羊群。一是另外找个适当的地方，挖一个地洞，每天晚上把羊赶进去；另一个办法是再圈两三块小地方，彼此相隔较远，愈隐蔽愈好，每个地方养六七只羊。万一大羊群遭到不测，我还可以花点时间和精力再恢复起来。这个办法虽然要付出很多时间和劳力，但我却认为是一个最合理的。我一路上担惊害怕，一步三回头往身后张望，时刻准备丢下筐子逃命。如果有人看到我那走路的样子，一定以为我做了什么亏心事，或新近受了什么极大的惊吓哩--受惊吓这倒也是事实！
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 可是，我一连跑去挤了两三天奶，什么也没有看到，我的胆子稍稍大了一点。我想，其实没有什么事情，都是我的想象罢了。但我还不能使自己确信那一定是自己的脚印，除非我再到海边去一趟，亲自看看那个脚印，用自己的脚去比一比，看看是不是一样大；只有这样，我才能确信那是我自己的脚樱不料，我一到那边，首先发现的是，当初我停放小船时，绝不可能在那儿上岸；其次，当我用自己的脚去比那脚印时，发现我的脚小得多。这两个情况又使我马上胡思乱想起来，并使我忧心忡忡，忐忑不安。结果我吓得浑身颤抖，好像发疟疾一样。我马上跑回家里，深信至少一个人或一些人上过岸。总之，岛上已经有人了，说不定什么时候会对我进行突然袭击，使我措手不及。至于我应采取什么措施进行防卫，却仍毫无头绪。
<br> 
<br> 唉！人在恐惧中所作出的决定是多么荒唐可笑啊！凡是理智提供他们保护自己的种种办法，一旦恐惧心占了上风，他们就不知道如何使用这些办法了。我的第一个想法，就是把那些围墙拆掉，把所有围地中的羊放回树林，任凭它们变成野羊，免得敌人发现之后，为了掠夺更多的羊而经常上岛骚扰；其次，我又打算索性把那两块谷物田也挖掉，免得他们在那里发现这种谷物后，再常常到岛上来劫掠。最后，我甚至想把乡间茅舍和海边住所的帐篷都通通毁掉，免得他们会发现住人的痕迹，从而会进行搜索，找出住在这里的人。
<br> 
<br> 这些都是我第二次从发现脚印的海边回家之后在晚上想到的种种问题。那时候，我又像第一次发现脚印后那样，惊魂不定，心里充满疑虑，心情忧郁低落。由此可见，对危险的恐惧比看到危险本身更可怕千百倍；而焦虑不安给人的思想负担又大大超过我们所真正担忧的坏事。更糟糕的是，我以前总能听天由命，从中获得安慰；而现在祸到临头，却不能使自己听从天命了，因而也无法获得任何安慰。我觉得我像《圣经》里的扫罗，不仅埋怨非利士人攻击他，并且埋怨上帝离弃了他。因为我现在没有用应有的办法来安定自己的心情，没有在危难中大声向上帝呼吁，也没有像以前那样把自己的安全和解救完全交托给上帝，听凭上帝的旨意。假如我那样做了，对这新的意料之外的事，我至少会乐观些，也会有更大的决心度过这一难关。
<br> 
<br> 我胡思乱想，彻夜不眠。到早晨，由于思虑过度，精神疲惫，才昏昏睡去。我睡得很香，醒来之后，觉得心里比以往任何时候都安定多了。我开始冷静地思考当前的问题。我内心进行了激烈的争辩，最后得出了这样的结论：这个小岛既然风景宜人，物产丰富，又离大陆不远，就不可能像我以前想象的那样绝无人迹。岛上虽然没有居民，但对面大陆上的船只有时完全有可能来岛上靠岸。那些上岛的人，有些可能有一定的目的，有些则可能被逆风刮过来的。
<br> 
<br> 我在这岛上已住了十五年了，但从未见过一个人影。因为，即使他们偶尔被逆风刮到岛上来，也总是尽快离开，看来，到目前为止，他们仍认为这座孤岛是不宜久居的地方。
<br> 
<br> 现在，对我来说最大的危险不过是那边大陆上偶尔在此登岸的三三两两的居民而已。他们是被逆风刮过来的，上岛完全是出于不得已，所以他们也不愿留下来，上岛后只要可能就尽快离开，很少在岛上过夜。否则的话，潮水一退，天色黑了，他们要离岛就困难了。所以，现在我只要找到一条安全的退路，一看到野人上岸就躲起来，别的事情就用不着操心了。
<br> 
<br> 这时，我深深后悔把山洞挖得太大了，并且还在围墙和岩石衔接处开了一个门。经过一番深思熟虑后，我决定在围墙外边，也就是我十二年前种两行树的地方，再筑起一道半圆形的防御工事。那些树原来就种得非常密，所以现在只须在树干之间再打一些木桩，就可以使树干之间的距离变得十分紧密。我很快就把这道围墙打好了。
<br> 
<br> 现在，我有两道墙了。我又在外墙上用了不少木料、旧缆索及其他我能想到的东西进一步加固，并在墙上开了七个小洞，大小刚好能伸出我的手臂。在围墙里面，我又从山洞里搬了不少泥土倒在墙脚上用脚踩实。这样，把墙加宽到十多英尺宽。这七个小洞是准备放我的短枪的。我从破船上拿下了七支短枪。现在把这些枪安置在七个洞里，并用架子支撑好，样子像七尊大炮。这样，在两分钟之内我可以连开七枪。我辛勤工作了好几个月，才完成了这道墙；而在没有完成以前，我一直感到自己不够安全。
<br> 
<br> 这项工程完成后，我又在墙外空地周围密密地插了一些杨柳树树桩或树枝，差不多插了两万多支，因为杨柳树特别容易生长。在杨柳树林与围墙之间，我特地留出一条很宽的空地。这样，如有敌人袭击，一下子就能发现。因为他们无法在外墙和小树间掩蔽自己，这样就难以接近外墙了。
<br> 
<br> 不到两年时间，我就有了一片浓密的丛林，不到五六年工夫，我住所面前便长期了一片森林，又浓密又粗壮，简直无法通行。谁也不会想到树林后会有什么东西，更不会想到有人会住在那儿了。在树林里我没有留出小路，因此我的进出办法是用两架梯子。一架梯子靠在树林侧面岩石较低的地上；岩石上有一个凹进去的地方，正好放第二架梯子。只要把两架梯子拿走，谁想走近城堡，谁就难以保护自己不受到我的反击；就算他能越过树林，也只是在我的外墙外边而进不了外墙。
<br> 
<br> 现在，我可以说已竭尽人类的智慧，千方百计地保护自己了。以后可以看到，我这样做不是没有道理的，虽然我目前还没有预见到什么危险，所感到的恐惧也没有什么具体的对象。
<br> 
<br> 进行上述工作时，我也没有忽略别的事情。我仍十分关心我的羊群，它们随时可以充分满足我的需要，使我不必浪费火药和子弹，也省得费力气去追捕野山羊。我当然不愿放弃自己驯养山羊所提供的便利，免得以后再从头开始驯养。
<br> 
<br> 为此，我考虑良久，觉得只有两个办法可以保全羊群。一是另外找个适当的地方，挖一个地洞，每天晚上把羊赶进去；另一个办法是再圈两三块小地方，彼此相隔较远，愈隐蔽愈好，每个地方养六七只羊。万一大羊群遭到不测，我还可以花点时间和精力再恢复起来。这个办法虽然要付出很多时间和劳力，但我却认为是一个最合理的计划。
<br> 
<br> 因此，我就花了一些时间，寻找岛上最深幽之处。我选定了一块非常隐蔽的地方，完全合乎我的理想。那是一片小小的湿洼地，周围是一片密林。这座密林正是我上次从岛的东部回家时几乎迷路的地方。这儿我找到一片空地，大约有三英亩大，四周的密林几乎像是天然的篱墙，至少用不着像我在别的地方圈地那样费时费力。
<br> 
<br> 于是，我立刻在这块地上干起来。不到一个月时间，篱墙就打好，羊群就可以养在里面了。现在这些山羊经过驯养，已不像以前那样野了，放在那儿十分安全。因此我一点也不敢耽搁，马上就移了十只小母羊和两只公羊到那儿去。羊移过去之后，我继续加固篱墙，做得与第一个圈地的篱墙一样坚固牢靠。所不同的是，我做第一个篱墙时比较从容不迫，花的时间也多得多。
<br> 
<br> 我辛辛苦苦从事各项工作，仅仅是因为我看到那只脚印，因而产生了种种疑惧。其实，直到现在，我还没有看到任何人到岛上来过。就这样在这种忐忑不安的心情下我又过了两年。这种不安的心情使我的生活远远不如从前那样舒畅了。这种情况任何人都可以想象的。试想一个人成天提心吊胆地生活，生怕有人会害他，这种生活会有什么乐趣呢？更令我痛心的是，这种不安的心情大大影响了我的宗教观念。因为我时刻担心落到野人或食人生番的手里，简直无心祈祷上帝；即使在祈祷的时候，也已不再有以往那种宁静和满足的心情了。
<br> 
<br> 我祈祷时，心情苦恼，精神负担很重，仿佛危机四伏，每夜都担心可能被野人吃掉似的。经验表明，平静、感激和崇敬的心情比恐怖和不安的心情更适于祈祷。一个人在大祸临头的恐惧下作祈祷，无异于在病榻上作忏悔祈祷，心情同样不安。这种时候是不宜作祈祷的，因为，这种不安的心情影响到一个人的心理，正如疾病影响肉体一样。不安是心灵上的缺陷，其危害性不亚于肉体上的缺陷，甚至超过肉体上的缺陷。而祈祷是心灵的行为，不是肉体的行为。
<br> 
<br> 现在，再接着说说我接下去做的事。我把一部分家畜安置妥当后，便走遍全岛，想再找一片这样深幽的地方，建立一个同样的小圈地养羊。我一直往岛的西部走，到了一个我从前从未涉足的地方。我往海里一看，仿佛看到极远处有一只船。我曾从破船上一个水手的箱子里找到了一两只望远镜，可惜没有带在身边。那船影太远，我也说不准到底是否是船。
<br> 
<br> 我一直凝望着，看得我眼睛都痛得看不下去了。当我从山上下来时，那船影似的东西已完全消失了，我也只好随它去了。
<br> 
<br> 不过，我由此下了决心，以后出门衣袋里一定要带一副望远镜。
<br> 
<br> 我走下山岗，来到小岛的尽头。这一带我以前从未来过。
<br> 一到这里，我马上明白，在岛上发现人的脚印，并不像我原来想象的那样稀奇。只是老天爷有意安排，让我飘流到岛上野人从来不到的那一头。否则，我早就知道，那些大陆上来的独木舟，有时在海上走得太远了，偶尔会渡过海峡到岛的这一边来找港口停泊。这是经常有的事。而且，他们的独木舟在海上相遇时，经常要打仗，打胜了的部落就把抓到的俘虏带到岛上这边来，按照他们吃人部落的习惯，把俘虏杀死吃掉。关于吃人肉的事，我下面再谈。
