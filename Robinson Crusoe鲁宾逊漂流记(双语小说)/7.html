My Island was now peopled, and I thought my self very rich in Subjects; and it was a merry Reflection which I frequently made, How like a King I look'd. First of all, the whole Country was my own meer Property; so that I had an undoubted Right of Dominion. 2dly, My People were perfectly subjected: I was absolute Lord and Law-giver; they all owed their Lives to me, and were ready to lay down their Lives, if there had been Occasion of it, for me. It was remarkable too, we had but three Subjects, and they were of three different Religions. My Man Friday was a Protestant, his Father was a Pagan and a Cannibal, and the Spaniard was a Papist: However, I allow'd Liberty of Conscience throughout my Dominions: But this is by the Way. 
<br> 
<br> As soon as I had secur'd my two weak rescued Prisoners, and given them Shelter, and a Place to rest them upon, I began to think of making some Provision for them: And the first thing I did, I order'd Friday to take a yearling Goat, betwixt a Kid and a Goat, out of my particular Flock, to be kill'd, when I cut off the hinder Quarter, and chopping it into small Pieces, I set Friday to Work to boiling and stewing, and made them a very good Dish, I assure you, of Flesh and Broth, having put some Barley and Rice also into the Broth; and as I cook'd it without Doors, for I made no Fire within my inner Wall, so I carry'd it all into the new Tent; and having set a Table there for them, I sat down and eat my own Dinner also with them, and, as well as I could, chear'd them and encourag'd them; Friday being my Interpreter, especially to his Father, and indeed to the Spaniard too; for the Spaniard spoke the Language of the Savages pretty well. 
<br> 
<br> After we had dined, or rather supped, I order'd Friday to take one of the Canoes, and go and fetch our Muskets and other Fire-Arms, which for Want of time we had left upon the Place of Battle, and the next Day I order'd him to go and bury the dead Bodies of the Savages, which lay open to the Sun, and would presently be offensive; and I also order'd him to bury the horrid Remains of their barbarous Feast, which I knew were pretty much, and which I could not think of doing my self; nay, I could not bear to see them, if I went that Way: All which he punctually performed, and defaced the very Appearance of the Savages being there; so that when I went again, I could scarce know where it was, otherwise than by the Corner of the Wood pointing to the Place. 
<br> 
<br> I then began to enter into a little Conversation with my two new Subjects; and first I set Friday to enquire of his Father, what he thought of the Escape of the Savages in that Canoe, and whether we might expect a Return of them with a Power too great for us to resist: His first Opinion was, that the Savages in the Boat never could live out the Storm which blew that Night they went off, but must of Necessity be drowned or driven South to those other Shores where they were as sure to be devoured as they were to be drowned if they were cast away; but as to what they would do if they came safe on Shore, he said he knew not; but it was his Opinion that they were so dreadfully frighted with the Manner of their being attack'd, the Noise and the Fire, that he believed they would tell their People, they were all kill'd by Thunder and Lightning, not by the Hand of Man, and that the two which appear'd, (viz.) Friday and me, were two Heavenly Spirits or Furies, come down to destroy them, and not Men with Weapons: This he said he knew, because he heard them all cry out so in their Language to one another, for it was impossible to them to conceive that a Man could dart Fire, and speak Thunder, and kill at a Distance without lifting up the Hand, as was done now: And this old Savage was in the right; for, as I understood since by other Hands, the Savages never attempted to go over to the Island afterwards; they were so terrified with the Accounts given by those four Men, (for it seems they did escape the Sea) that they believ'd whoever went to that enchanted Island would be destroy'd with Fire from the Gods. 
<br> 
<br> This however I knew not, and therefore was under continual Apprehensions for a good while, and kept always upon my Guard, me and all my Army; for as we were now four of us, I would have ventur'd upon a hundred of them fairly in the open Field at any Time. 
<br> 
<br> In a little Time, however, no more Canoes appearing, the Fear of their Coming wore off, and I began to take my former Thoughts of a Voyage to the Main into Consideration, being likewise assur'd by Friday's Father, that I might depend upon good Usage from their Nation on his Account, if I would go. 
<br> 
<br> But my Thoughts were a little suspended, when I had a serious Discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood that there were sixteen more of his Countrymen and Portuguese, who having been cast away, and made their Escape to that Side, liv'd there at Peace indeed with the Savages, but were very sore put to it for Necessaries, and indeed for Life: I ask'd him all the Particulars of their Voyage, and found they were a Spanish Ship bound from the Rio de la Plata to the Havana, being directed to leave their Loading there, which was chiefly Hides and Silver, and to bring back what European Goods they could meet with there; that they had five Portuguese Seamen on Board, who they took out of another Wreck; that five of their own Men were drowned when the first Ship was lost, and that these escaped thro' infinite Dangers and Hazards, and arriv'd almost starv'd on the Cannibal Coast, where they expected to have been devour'd every Moment. 
<br> 
<br> He told me, they had some Arms with them, but they were perfectly useless, for that they had neither Powder or Ball, the Washing of the Sea having spoil'd all their Powder but a little, which they used at their first Landing to provide themselves some Food. 
<br> 
<br> I ask'd him what he thought would become of them there, and if they had form'd no Design of making any Escape? He said, They had many Consultations about it, but that having neither Vessel, or Tools to build one, or Provisions of any kind, their Councils always ended in Tears and Despair. 
<br> 
<br> I ask'd him how he thought they would receive a Proposal from me, which might tend towards an Escape? And whether, if they were all here, it might not be done? I told him with Freedom, I fear'd mostly their Treachery and ill Usage of me, if I put my Life in their Hands; for that Gratitude was no inherent Virtue in the Nature of Man; nor did Men always square their Dealings by the Obligations they had receiv'd, So much as they did by the Advantages they expected. I told him it would be very hard, that I should be the Instrument of their Deliverance, and that they should afterwards make me their Prisoner in New Spain, where an English Man was certain to be made a Sacrifice, what Necessity, or what Accident soever, brought him thither: And that I had rather be deliver'd up to the Savages, and be devour'd alive, than fall into the merciless Claws of the Priests, and be carry'd into the Inquisition. I added, That otherwise I was perswaded, if they were all here, we might, with so many Hands, build a Bark large enough to carry us all away, either to the Brasils South-ward, or to the Islands or Spanish Coast North-ward: But that if in Requital they should, when I had put Weapons into their Hands, catty me by Force among their own People, I might be ill used for my Kindness to them, and make my Case worse than it was before. 
<br> 
<br> He answer'd with a great deal of Candor and Ingenuity, That their Condition was so miserable, and they were so sensible of it, that he believed they would abhor the Thought of using any Man unkindly that should contribute to their Deliverance; and that, if I pleased, he would go to them with the old Man, and discourse with them about it, and return again, and bring me their Answer: That he would make Conditions with them upon their solemn Oath, That they should be absolutely under my Leading, as their Commander and Captain; and that they should swear upon the Holy Sacraments and the Gospel, to be true to me, and to go to such Christian Country, as that I should agree to, and no other; and to be directed wholly and absolutely by my Orders, 'till they were landed safely in such Country, as I intended; and that he would bring a Contract from them under their Hands for that Purpose. 
<br> 
<br> Then he told me, he would first swear to me himself, That he would never stir from me as long as he liv'd, 'till I gave him Orders; and that he would take my Side to the last drop of his Blood, if there should happen the least Breach of Faith among his Country-men. 
<br> 
<br> He told me, they were all of them very civil honest Men, and they were under the greatest Distress imaginable, having neither Weapons or Cloaths, nor any Food, but at the Mercy and Discretion of the Savages; out of all Hopes of ever returning to their own Country; and that he was sure, if I would undertake their Relief, they would live and die by me. 
<br> 
<br> Upon these Assurances, I resolv'd to venture to relieve them, if possible, and to send the old Savage and this Spaniard over to them to treat: But when we had gotten all things in a Readiness to go, the Spaniard himself started an Objection, which had so much Prudence in it on one hand, and so much Sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be very well satisfy'd in it; and by his Advice, put off the Deliverance of his Comerades, for at least half a Year. The Case was thus: 
<br> 
<br> He had been with us now about a Month; during which time, I had let him see in what Manner I had provided, with the Assistance of Providence, for my Support; and he saw evidently what Stock of Corn and Rice I had laid up; which as it was more than sufficient for my self, so it was not sufficient, at least without good Husbandry, for my Family; now it was encreas'd to Number four: But much less would it be sufficient, if his Country-men, who were, as he said, fourteen' still alive, should Come over. And least of all should it be sufficient to victual our Vessel, if we should build one, for a Voyage to any of the Christian Colonies of America. So he told me, he thought it would be more advisable, to let him and the two other, dig and cultivate some more Land, as much as I could spare Seed to sow; and that we should wait another Harvest, that we might have a Supply of Corn for his Country-men when they should come; for Want might be a Temptation to them to disagree, or not to think themselves delivered, otherwise than out of one Difficulty into another. You know, says he, the Children of Israel, though they rejoyc'd at first for their being deliver'd out of Egypt, yet rebell'd even against God himself that deliver'd them, when they came to want Bread in the Wilderness. 
<br> 
<br> His Caution was so seasonable, and his Advice so good, that I could not but be very well pleased with his Proposal, as well as I was satisfy'd with his Fidelity. So we fell to digging all four of us, as well as the Wooden Tools we were furnish'd with permitted; and in about a Month's time, by the End of which it was Seed time, we had gotten as much Land cur'd and trim'd up, as we sowed 22 Bushels of Barley on, and 16 Jarrs of Rice, which was in short all the Seed we had to spare; nor indeed did we leave our selves Barley sufficient for our own Food, for the six Months that we had to expect our Crop, that is to say, reckoning from the time we set our Seed aside for sowing; for it is not to be supposed it is six Months in the Ground in the Country. 
<br> 
<br> Having now Society enough, and our Number being sufficient to put us out of Fear of the Savages, if they had come, unless their Number had been very great, we went freely all over the Island, where-ever we found Occasion; and as here we had our Escape or Deliverance upon our Thoughts, it was impossible, at least for me, to have the Means of it out of mine; to this Purpose, I mark'd out several Trees which I thought fit for our Work, and I set Friday and his Father to cutting them down; and then I caused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted my Thought on that Affair, to oversee and direct their Work. I shewed them with what indefatigable Pains I had hewed a large Tree into single Planks, and I caused them to do the like, till they had made about a Dozen large Planks of good Oak, near 2 Foot road, 35 Foot long, and from 2 Inches to 4 Inches thick: hat prodigious Labour it took up, any one may imagine. At the same time I contriv'd to encrease my little Flock of tame Goats as much as I could; and to this Purpose, I made Friday and the Spaniard go out one Day, and my self with Friday the next Day; for we took our Turns: And by is Means we got above 20 young Kids to breed up with the rest; for when-ever we shot the Dam, we saved the Kids, and added them to our Flock: But above all, the Season for curing the Grapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious Quantity to be hung up in the Sun, that I believe, had we been at Alicant where the Raisins of the Sun are cur'd, we could have fill'd 60 or 80 Barrels; and these with our Bread was a great Part of our Food, and very good living too, I assure you; for it is an exceeding nourishing Food. 
<br> 
<br> It was now Harvest, and our Crop in good Order; it was not the most plentiful Encrease I had seen in the Island, but however it was enough to answer our End; for from our 22 Bushels of Barley, we brought in and thrashed out above 220 Bushels; and the like in Proportion of the Rice, which was Store enough for our Food to the next Harvest, tho' all the 16 Spaniards had been on Shore with me; or if we had been ready for a Voyage, it would very plentifully have victualled our Ship, to have carry'd us to any Part of the World, that is to say, of America. 
<br> 
<br> When we had thus hous'd and secur'd our Magazine of Corn, we fell to Work to make more Wicker Work, (viz.) great Baskets in which we kept it; and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous at this Part, and often blam'd me that I did not make some things, for Defence, of this Kind of Work; but I saw no Need of it. 
<br> 
<br> And now having a full Supply of Food for all the Guests I expected, I gave the Spaniard Leave to go over to the Main, to see what he could do with those he had left behind him there. I gave him a strict Charge in Writing, Not to bring any Man with him, who would not first swear in the Presence of himself and of the old Savage, That he would no way injure, fight with, or attack the Person he should find in the Island, who was so kind to send for them in order to their Deliverance; but that they would stand by and defend him against all such Attempts, and wherever they went, would be entirely under and subjected to his Commands; and that this should be put in Writing, and signed with their Hands: How we were to have this done, when I knew they had neither Pen or Ink; that indeed was a Question which we never asked. 
<br> 
<br> Under these Instructions, the Spaniard, and the old Savage the Father of Friday, went away in one of the Canoes, which they might be said to come in, or rather were brought in, when they came as Prisoners to be devour'd by the Savages. 
<br> 
<br> I gave each of them a Musket with a Firelock on it, and about eight Charges of Powder and Ball, charging them to be very good Husbands of both, and not to use either of them but upon urgent Occasion. 
<br> 
<br> This was a chearful Work, being the first Measures used by me in View of my Deliverance for now 27 Years and some Days. I gave them Provisions of Bread, and of dry'd Grapes, sufficient for themselves for many Days, and sufficient for all their Country-men for about eight Days time; and wishing them a good Voyage, I see them go, agreeing with them about a Signal they should hang out at their Return, by which I should know them again, when they came back, at a Distance, before they came on Shore. 
<br> 
<br> They went away with a fair Gale on the Day that the Moon was at Full by my Account, in the Month of October: But as for an exact Reckoning of Days, after I had once lost it I could never recover it again; nor had I kept even the Number of Years so punctually, as to be sure that I was right, tho' as it prov'd, when I afterwards examin'd my Account, I found I had kept a true Reckoning of Years. 
<br> 
<br> It was no less than eight Days I had waited for them, when a Strange and unforeseen Accident interveen'd, of which the like has not perhaps been heard of in History: I was fast asleep in my Hutch one Morning, when my Man Friday came running in to me, and call'd aloud, Master, Master, they are come, they are come. 
<br> 
<br> I jump'd up, and regardless of Danger, I went out, as soon as I could get my Cloaths on, thro' my little Grove, which by the Way was by this time grown to be a very thick Wood; I say, regardless of Danger, I went without my Arms, which was not my Custom to do: But I was surpriz'd, when turning my Eyes to the Sea, I presently saw a Boat at about a League and half's Distance, standing in for the Shore, with a Shoulder of Mutton Sail, as they call it; and the Wind blowing pretty fair to bring them in; also I observ'd presently, that they did not come from that Side which the Shore lay on, but from the Southermost End of the Island: Upon this I call'd Friday in, and bid him lie close, for these were not the People we look'd for, and that we might not know yet whether they were Friends or Enemies. 
<br> 
<br> In the next Place, I went in to fetch my Perspective Glass, to see what I could make of them; and having taken the Ladder out, I climb'd up to the Top of the Hill, as I used to do when I was apprehensive of any thing, and to take my View the plainer without being discover'd. 
<br> 
<br> I had scarce Set my Foot on the Hill, when my Eye plainly discover'd a Ship lying at an Anchor, at about two Leagues and an half's Distance from me South-south-east, but not above a League and an half from the Shore. By my Observation it appear'd plainly to be an English Ship, and the Boat appear'd to be an English Long-Boat. 
<br> 
<br> I cannot express the Confusion I was in, tho' the Joy of seeing a Ship, and one who I had Reason to believe was Mann'd by my own Country-men, and consequently Friends, was such as I cannot describe; but yet I had some secret Doubts hung about me, I cannot tell from whence they came, bidding me keep upon my Guard. In the first Place, it occurr'd to me to consider what Business an English Ship could have in that Part of the World, since it was not the Way to or from any Part of the World, where the English had any Traffick; and I knew there had been no Storms to drive them in there, as in Distress; and that if they were English really, it was most probable that they were here upon no good Design; and that I had better continue as I was, than fall into the Hands of Thieves and Murtherers. 
<br> 
<br> Let no Man despise the secret Hints and Notices of Danger, which sometimes are given him, when he may think there is no Possibility of its being real. That such Hints and Notices are given us, I believe few that have made any Observations of things, can deny; that they are certain Discoveries' of an invisible World, and a Converse of Spirits, we cannot doubt; and if the Tendency of them seems to be to warn us of Danger, why should we not suppose they are from some friendly Agent, whether supreme, or inferior, and subordinate, is not the Question; and that they are given for our Good? 
<br> 
<br> The present Question abundantly confirms me in the Justice of this Reasoning; for had I not been made cautious by this secret Admonition, come it from whence it will, I had been undone inevitably, and in a far worse Condition than before, as you will see presently. 
<br> 
<br> I had not kept my self long in this Posture, but I saw the Boat draw near the Shore, as if they look'd for a Creek to thrust in at for the Convenience of Landing; however, as they did not come quite far enough, they did not see the little Inlet where I formerly landed my Rafts; but run their Boat on Shore upon the Beach, at about half a Mile from me, which was very happy for me; for otherwise they would have landed just as I may say at my Door, and would soon have beaten me out of my Castle, and perhaps have plunder'd me of all I had. 
<br> 
<br> When they were on Shore, I was fully satisfy'd that they were English Men; at least, most of them; one or two I thought were Dutch; but it did not prove so: There were in all eleven Men, whereof three of them I found were unarm'd, and as I thought, bound; and when the first four or five of them were jump'd on Shore, they took those three out of the Boat as Prisoners: One of the three I could perceive using the most passionate Gestures of Entreaty, Affliction and Despair, even to a kind of Extravagance; the other two I could perceive lifted up their Hands sometimes, and appear'd concern'd indeed, but not to such a Degree as the first. 
<br> 
<br> I was perfectly confounded at the Sight, and knew not what the Meaning of it should be. Friday call'd out to me in English, as well as he could, O Master! You see English Mans eat Prisoner as well as Savage Mans. Why, says I, Friday, Do you think they are a going to eat them then? Yes, says Friday, They mill eat them: No, no, says I, Friday, I am afraid they mill murther them indeed, but you may be sure they will not eat them. 
<br> 
<br> All this while I had no thought of what the Matter really was; but Stood trembling with the Horror of the Sight, expecting every Moment when the three Prisoners should be kill'd; nay, Once I saw one of the Villains lift up his Arm with a great Cutlash, as the Seamen call it, or Sword, to spike one of the poor Men; and I expected to see him fall every Moment, at which all the Blood in my Body seem'd to run chill in my Veins. 
<br> 
<br> I wish'd heartily now for my Spaniard, and the Savage that was gone with him; or that I had any way to have come undiscover'd within shot of them, that I might have rescu'd the three Men; for I saw no Fire Arms they had among them; but it fell out to my Mind another way. 
<br> 
<br> After I had Observ'd the outragious Usage of the three Men, by the insolent Seamen, I observ'd the Fellows run scattering about the Land, as if they wanted to see the Country: I observ'd that the three other Men had Liberty to go also where they pleas'd; but they Sat down all three upon the Ground, very pensive, and look'd like Men in Despair. 
<br> 
<br> This put me in Mind of the first Time when I came on Shore, and began to look about me; How I gave my self over for lost: How wildly I look'd round me: What dreadful Apprehensions I had: And how I lodg'd in the Tree all Night for fear of being devour'd by wild Beasts. 
<br> 
<br> As I knew nothing that Night of the Supply I was to receive by the providential Driving of the Ship nearer the Land, by the Storms and Tide, by which I have since been so long nourish'd and Supported; so these three poor desolate Men knew nothing how certain of Deliverance and Supply they were, how near it was to them, and how effectually and really they were in a Condition of Safety, at the same Time that they thought themselves lost, and their Case desperate. 
<br> 
<br> So little do we see before us in the World, and so much reason have we to depend chearfully upon the great Maker of the World, that he does not leave his Creatures so absolutely destitute, but that in the worst Circumstances they have always something to be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer their Deliverance than they imagine; nay, are even brought to their Deliverance by the Means by which they seem to be brought to their Destruction. 
<br> 
<br> It was just at the Top of High-Water when these People came on Shore, and while partly they stood parlying with the Prisoners they brought, and partly while they rambled about to see what kind of a Place they were in; they had carelessly staid till the Tide was spent, and the Water was ebb'd considerably away, leaving their Boat a-ground. 
<br> 
<br> They had left two Men in the Boat, who as I found afterwards, having drank a little too much Brandy, fell a-sleep; however, one of them waking Sooner than the other, and finding the Boat too fast a-ground for him to stir it, hollow'd for the rest who were straggling about, upon which they all Soon came to the Boat; but it was past all their Strength to launch her, the Boat being very heavy, and the Shore on that Side being a soft ousy Sand, almost like a Quick-Sand. 
<br> 
<br> In this Condition, like true Seamen who are perhaps the and least of all Mankind given to lore-thought, they gave it over, and away they stroll'd about the Country again; and I heard one of them say aloud to another, calling them off from the Boat, Why let her alone, Jack, can't ye, she will float next Tide; by which I was fully confirm'd in the main Enquiry, of what Countrymen they were. 
<br> 
<br> All this while I kept my self very close, not once daring to stir out of my Castle, any farther than to my Place of Observation, near the Top of the Hill; and very glad I was, to think how well it was fortify'd: I knew it was no less than ten Hours before the Boat could be on float again, and by that Time it would be dark, and I might be at more Liberty to see their Motions, and to hear their Discourse, if they had any. 
<br> 
<br> In the mean Time, I fitted my self up for a Battle, as before; though with more Caution, knowing I had to do with another kind of Enemy than I had at first: I order'd Friday also, who I had made an excellent Marks-Man with his Gun, to load himself with Arms: I took my self two Fowling-Pieces, and I gave him three Muskets; my Figure indeed was very fierce; I had my formidable Goat-Skin Coat on, with the great Cap I have mention'd, a naked Sword by my Side, two Pistols in my Belt, and a Gun upon each Shoulder. 
<br> 
<br> It was my Design, as I said above, not to have made any Attempt till it was Dark: But about Two a Clock, being the Heat of the Day, I found that in short they were all gone straggling into the Woods, and as I thought were laid down to Sleep. The three poor distressed Men, too Anxious for their Condition to get any Sleep, were however set down under the Shelter of a great Tree, at about a quarter of a Mile from me, and as I thought out of sight of any of the rest. 
<br> 
<br> Upon this I resolv'd to discover my self to them, and learn something of their Condition: Immediately I march'd in the Figure as above, my Man Friday at a good Distance behind me, as formidable for his Arms as I, but not making quite so staring a Spectre-like Figure as I did. 
<br> 
<br> I came as near them undiscover'd as I could, and then before any of them saw me, I call'd aloud to them in Spanish, What are ye Gentlemen? 
<br> 
<br> They started up at the Noise, but were ten times more confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth Figure that I made. They made no Answer at all, but I thought I perceiv'd them just going to fly from me, when I spoke to them in English, Gentlemen, said I, do not be surpriz'd at me; perhaps you may have a Friend near you when you did not expect it. He must be sent directly from Heaven then, said one of them very gravely to me, and pulling off his Hat at the same time to me, for our Condition is past the Help of Man. All Help is from Heaven, Sir, said I. But can you put a Stranger in the way how to help you, for you seem to me to be in some great Distress? I saw you when you landed, and when you Seem'd to make Applications to the Brutes that came with you, I saw one of them lift up his Sword to kill you. 
<br> 
<br> The poor Man with Tears running down his Face, and trembling, looking like one astonish'd, return'd, Am I talking to God, or Man! Is it a real Man, or an Angel! Be in no fear about that, Sir, said I, if God had sent an Angel to relieve you, he would have come better Cloath'd, and Arm'd after another manner than you see me in; pray lay aside your Fears, I am a Man, an English-man, and dispos'd to assist you, you see; I have one Servant only; we have Arms and Ammunition; tell us freely, Can we serve you ? - What is your Case? 
<br> 
<br> Our Case, said he, Sir, is too long to tell you, while our Murtherers are so near; but in Short, Sir, I was Commander of that Ship, my Men have Mutinied against me; they have been hardly prevail'd on not to Murther me, and at last have set me on Shore in this desolate Place, with these two Men with me; one my Mate, the other a Passenger, where we expected to Perish, believing the Place to be uninhabited, and know not yet what to think of it. 
<br> 
<br> Where are those Brutes, your Enemies, said I, do you know where they are gone? There they lye, Sir, Said he, pointing to a Thicket of Trees; my Heart trembles, for fear they have seen us, and heard you speak, if they have, they will certainly Murther us all. 
<br> 
<br> Have they any Fire-Arms, said I, He answered they had only two Pieces, and one which they left in the Boat. Well then, Said I, leave the rest to me; I see they are all asleep, it is an easie thing to kill them all; but shall we rather take them Prisoners? He told me there were two desperate Villains among them, that it was scarce safe to shew any Mercy to; but if they were secur'd, he believ'd all the rest would return to their Duty. I ask'd him, which they were? He told me he could not at that distance describe them; but he would obey my Orders in any thing I would direct. Well, says I, let us retreat out of their View or Hearing, least they awake, and we will resolve further; so they willingly went back with me, till the Woods cover'd us from them. 
<br> 
<br> Look you, Sir, said I, if I venture upon your Deliverance, are you willing to make two Conditions with me? he anticipated my Proposals, by telling me, that both he and the Ship, if recover'd, should be wholly Directed and Commanded by me in every thing; and if the Ship was not recover'd, he would live and dye with me in what Part of the World soever I would send him; and the two other Men said the same. 
<br> 
<br> Well, says I, my Conditions are but two. 1. That while you stay on this Island with me, you will not pretend to any Authority here; and if I put Arms into your Hands, you will upon all Occasions give them up to me, and do no Prejudice to me or mine, upon this Island, and in the mean time be govern'd by my Orders. 
<br> 
<br> 2. That if the Ship is, or may be recover'd, you will carry me and my Man to England Passage free. 
<br> 
<br> He gave me all the Assurances that the Invention and Faith of Man could devise, that he would comply with these most reasonable Demands, and besides would owe his Life to me, and acknowledge it upon all Occasions as long as he liv'd. 
<br> 
<br> Well then, said I, here are three Muskets for you, with Powder and Ball; tell me next what you think is proper to be done. He shew'd all the Testimony of his Gratitude that he was able; but offer'd to be wholly guided by me. I told him I thought it was hard venturing any thing; but the best Method I could think of was to fire upon them at once, as they lay; and if any was not kill'd at the first Volley, and offered to submit, we might save them, and so put it wholly upon God's Providence to direct the Shot. 
<br> 
<br> He said very modestly, that he was loath to kill them, if he could help it, but that those two were incorrigible Villains, and had been the Authors of all the Mutiny in the Ship, and if they escaped, we should be undone still; for they would go on Board, and bring the whole Ship's Company, and destroy us all. Well then, says I, Necessity legitimates my Advice; for it is the only Way to save our Lives. However, seeing him still cautious of shedding Blood, I told him they should go themselves, and manage as they found convenient. 
<br> 
<br> In the Middle of this Discourse, we heard some of them awake, and soon after, we saw two of them on their Feet, I ask'd him, if either of them were of the Men who he had said were the Heads of the Mutiny? He said, No: Well then, said I, you may let them escape, and Providence seems to have wakned them on Purpose to save themselves. Now, says I, if the rest escape you, it is your Fault. 
<br> 
<br> Animated with this, he took the Musket, I had given him, in his Hand, and a Pistol in his Belt, and his two Comerades with him, with each Man a Piece in his Hand. The two Men who were with him, going first, made some Noise, at which one of the Seamen who was awake, turn'd about, and seeing them coming, cry'd out to the rest; but it was too late then; for the Moment he cry'd out, they fir'd; I mean the two Men, the Captain wisely reserving his own Piece: They had so well aim'd their Shot at the Men they knew, that one of them was kill'd on the Spot, and the other very much wounded; but not being dead, he started up upon his Feet, and call'd eagerly for help to the other; but the Captain stepping to him, told him, 'twas too late to cry for help, he should call upon God to forgive his Villany, and with that Word knock'd him down with the Stock of his Musket, so that he never spoke more: There were three more in the Company, and one of them was also slightly wounded: By this Time I was come, and when they saw their Danger, and that it was in vain to resist, they begg'd for Mercy: The Captain told them, he would spare their Lives, if they would give him any Assurance of their Abhorrence of the Treachery they had been guilty of, and would swear to be faithful to him in recovering the Ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica, from whence they came: They gave him all the Protestations of their Sincerity that could be desir'd, and he was willing to believe them, and spare their Lives, which I was not against, only that I oblig'd him to keep them bound Hand and Foot while they were upon the Island. 
<br> 
<br> While this was doing, I sent Friday with the Captain's Mate to the Boat, with Orders to secure her, and bring away the Oars, and Sail, which they did; and by and by, three straggling Men that were (happily for them) parted from the rest, came back upon hearing the Guns fir'd, and seeing their Captain, who before was their Prisoner, now their Conqueror, they submitted to be bound also; and so our Victory was compleat. 
<br> 
<br> It now remain'd, that the Captain and I should enquire into one another's Circumstances: I began first, and told him my whole History, which he heard with an Attention even to Amazement; and particularly, at the wonderful Manner of my being furnish'd with Provisions and Ammunition; and indeed, as my Story is a whole Collection of Wonders, it affected him deeply; but when he reflected from thence upon himself, and how I seem'd to have been preserv'd there, on purpose to save his Life, the Tears ran down his Face, and he could not speak a Word more. 
<br> 
<br> After this Communication was at an End, I carry'd him and his two Men into my Apartment, leading them in, just where I came out, viz. At the Top of the House, where I refresh'd them with such Provisions as I had, and shew'd them all the Contrivances I had made, during my long, long, inhabiting that Place. 
<br> 
<br> All I shew'd them, all I Said to them, was perfectly amazing; but above all, the Captain admir'd my Fortification, and how perfectly I had conceal'd my Retreat with a Grove of Trees, which having been now planted near twenty Years, and the Trees growing much faster than in England, was become a little Wood, and so thick, that it was unpassable in any Part of it, but at that one Side, where I had reserv'd my little winding Passage into it: I told him, this was my Castle, and my Residence; but that I had a Seat in the Country, as most Princes have, whither I could retreat upon Occasion, and I would shew him that too another Time; but at present, our Business was to consider how to recover the Ship: He agreed with me as to that; but told me, he was perfectly at a Loss what Measures to take; for that there were still six and twenty Hands on board, who having entred into a cursed Conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their Lives to the Law, would be harden'd in it now by Desperation; and would carry it on, knowing that if they were reduc'd, they should be brought to the Gallows, as soon as they came to England, or to any of the English Colonies; and that therefore there would be no attacking them, with so small a Number as we were. 
<br> 
<br> I mus'd for some Time upon what he had said; and found it was a very rational Conclusion; and that therefore something was to be resolv'd on very speedily, as well to draw the Men on board into some Snare for their Surprize, as to prevent their Landing upon us, and destroying us; upon this it presently occurr'd to me, that in a little while the Ship's Crew wondring what was become of their Comrades, and of the Boat, would certainly come on Shore in their other Boat, to see for them, and that then perhaps they might come arm'd, and be too strong for us; this he allow'd was rational. 
<br> 
<br> Upon this, I told him the first Thing we had to do, was to stave the Boat, which lay upon the Beach, so that they might not carry her off; and taking every Thing out of her, leave her so far useless as not to be fit to swim; accordingly we went on board, took the Arms which were left on board, out of her, and whatever else we found there, which was a Bottle of Brandy, and another of Rum, a few Bisket Cakes, a Horn of Powder, and a great Lump of Sugar, in a Piece of Canvas; the Sugar was five or six Pounds; all which was very welcome to me, especially the Brandy, and Sugar, of which I had had none left for many Years. 
<br> 
<br> When we had carry'd all these Things on Shore (the Oars, Mast, Sail, and Rudder of the Boat, were carry'd away before, as above) we knock'd a great Hole in her Bottom, that if they had come strong enough to master us, yet they could not carry off the Boat. 
<br> 
<br> Indeed, it was not much in my Thoughts, that we could be able to recover the Ship; but my View was that if they went away without the Boat, I did not much question to make her fit again, to carry us away to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our Friends, the Spaniards, in my Way, for I had them still in my Thoughts. 
<br> 
<br> While we were thus preparing our Designs, and had first, by main Strength heav'd the Boat up upon the Beach, so high that the Tide would not fleet her off at High-Water-Mark; and besides, had broke a Hole in her Bottom, too big to be quickly stopp'd, and were sat down musing what we should do; we heard the Ship fire a Gun, and saw her make a Waft with her Antient, as a Signal for the Boat to come on board; but no Boat stirr'd; and they fir'd several Times, making other Signals for the Boat. 
<br> 
<br> At last, when all their Signals and Firings prov'd fruitless, and they found the Boat did not stir, we saw them by the Help of my Glasses, hoist another Boat out, and row towards the Shore; and we found as they approach'd, that there was no less than ten Men in her, and that they had Fire-Arms with them. 
<br> 
<br> As the Ship lay almost two Leagues from the Shore, we had a full View of them as they came, and a plain Sight of the Men even of their Faces, because the Tide having set them a little to the East of the other Boat, they row'd up under Shore, to come to the same Place, where the other had landed, and where the Boat lay. 
<br> 
<br> By this Means, I say, we had a full View of them, and the Captain knew the Persons and Characters of all the Men in the Boat, of whom he said, that there were three very honest Fellows, who he was sure were led into this Conspiracy by the rest, being over-power'd and frighted. 
<br> 
<br> But that as for the Boatswain, who it seems was the chief Officer among them, and all the rest, they were as outragious as any of the Ship's Crew, and were no doubt made desperate in their new Enterprize, and terribly apprehensive he was, that they would be too powerful for us. 
<br> 
<br> I smil'd at him, and told him, that Men in our Circumstances were past the Operation of Fear: That seeing almost every Condition that could be, was better than that which we were suppos'd to be in, we ought to expect that the Consequence, whether Death or Life, would be sure to be a Deliverance: I ask'd him, What he thought of the Circumstances of my Life? And, Whether a Deliverance were not worth venturing for? And where, Sir, said I, is your Belief of my being preserv'd here on purpose to save your Life, which elevated you a little while ago? For my Part, said I, there seems to be but one Thing amiss in all the Prospect of it; What's that? Says he; why, said I, 'Tis, that as you say, there are three or four honest Fellows among them, which should be spar'd; had they been all of the wicked Part of the Crew, I should have thought God's Providence had singled them out to deliver them into your Hands; for depend upon it, every Man of them that comes a-shore are our own, and shall die, or live, as they behave to us. 
<br> 
<br> As I spoke this with a rais'd Voice and chearful Countenance, I found it greatly encourag'd him; so we set vigorously to our Business: We had upon the first Appearance of the Boat's coming from the Ship, consider'd of separating our Prisoners, and had indeed secur'd them effectually. 
<br> 
<br> Two of them, of whom the Captain was less assur'd than ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of the three (deliver'd Men) to my Cave, where they were remote enough, and out of Danger of being heard or discover'd, or of finding their way out of the Woods, if they could have deliver'd themselves: Here they left them bound, but gave them Provisions, They promis'd them if they continu'd there quietly, to give them their Liberty in a Day or two; but that if they attempted their Escape, they should be put to Death without Mercy: They promis'd faithfully to bear their Confinement with Patience, and were very thankful that they had such good Usage, as to have Provisions, and a Light left them; for Friday gave them Candles (such as we made our selves) for their Comfort; and they did not know but that he stood Sentinel over them at the Entrance. 
<br> 
<br> The other Prisoners had better Usage; two of them were kept pinion'd indeed, because the Captain was not free to trust them; but the other two were taken into my Service upon their Captain's Recommendation, and upon their solemnly engaging to live and die with us; so with them and the three honest Men, we were seven Men, well arm'd; and I made no doubt we shou'd be able to deal well enough with the Ten that were a coming, considering that the Captain had said, there were three or four honest Men among them also. 
<br> 
<br> As soon as they got to the Place where their other Boat lay, they run their Boat in to the Beach, and came all on Shore, haling the Boat up after them, which I was glad to see; for I was afraid they would rather have left the Boat at an Anchor, some Distance from the Shore, with some Hands in her, to guard her; and so we should not be able to seize the Boat. 
<br> 
<br> Being on Shore, the first Thing they did, they ran all to their other Boat, and it was easy to see that they were under a great Surprize, to find her stripp'd as above, of all that was in her, and a great hole in her Bottom. 
<br> 
<br> After they had mus'd a while upon this, they set up two or three great Shouts, hollowing with all their might, to try if they could make their Companions hear; but all was to no purpose: Then they came all close in a Ring, and fir'd a Volley of their small Arms, which indeed we heard, and the Ecchos made the Woods ring; but it was all One, those in the Cave we were sure could not hear, and those in our keeping, though they heard it well enough, yet durst give no Answer to them. 
<br> 
<br> They were so astonish'd at the Surprize of this, that as they told us afterwards, they resolv'd to go all on board again to their Ship, and let them know, that the Men were all murther'd, and the Long-Boat stav'd; accordingly they immediately launch'd their Boat again, and gat all of them on board. 
<br> 
<br> The Captain was terribly amaz'd, and even confounded at this, believing they would go on board the Ship again, and set Sail, giving their Comrades for lost, and so he should still lose the Ship, which he was in Hopes we should have recover'd; but he was quickly as much frighted the other way. 
<br> 
<br> They had not been long put off with the Boat, but we perceiv'd them all coming on Shore again; but with this new Measure in their Conduct, which it seems they consulted together upon, viz. To leave three Men in the Boat, and the rest to go on Shore, and go up into the Country to look for their Fellows. 
<br> 
<br> This was a great Disappointment to us; for now we were at a Loss what to do; for our Seizing those Seven Men on Shore would be no Advantage to us, if we let the Boat escape; because they would then row away to the Ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to weigh and set Sail, and so our recovering the Ship would be lost. 
<br> 
<br> However, we had no Remedy, but to wait and see what the Issue of Things might present; the seven Men came on Shore, and the three who remain'd in the Boat, put her off to a good Distance from the Shore, and came to an Anchor to wait for them; so that it was impossible for us to come at them in the Boat. 
<br> 
<br> Those that came on Shore, kept close together, marching towards the Top of the little Hill, under which my Habitation lay; and we could see them plainly, though they could not perceive us: We could have been very glad they would have come nearer to us, so that we might have fir'd at them, or that they would have gone farther off, that we might have come abroad. 
<br> 
<br> But when they were come to the Brow of the Hill, where they could see a great way into the Valleys and Woods, which lay towards the North-East Part, and where the Island lay lowest, they shouted, and hollow'd, till they were weary; and not caring it seems to venture far from the Shore, nor far from one another, they sat down together under a Tree, to consider of it: Had they thought fit to have gone to sleep there, as the other Party of them had done, they had done the Jobb for us; but they were too full of Apprehensions of Danger, to venture to go to sleep, though they could not tell what the Danger was they had to fear neither. 
<br> 
<br> The Captain made a very just Proposal to me, upon this Consultation of theirs, viz. That perhaps they would all fire a Volley again, to endeavour to make their Fellows hear, and that we should all Sally upon them, just at the Juncture when their Pieces were all discharg'd, and they would certainly yield, and we should have them without Bloodshed: I lik'd the Proposal, provided it was done while we heard, when they were presently stopp'd by the Creek, where the Water being up, they could not get over, and call'd for the Boat to come up, and Set them over, as indeed I expected. 
<br> 
<br> When they had Set themselves over, I observ'd, that the Boat being gone up a good way into the Creek, and as it were, in a Harbour within the Land, they took one of the three Men out of her to go along with them, and left only two in the Boat, having fastned her to the Stump of a little Tree on the Shore. 
<br> 
<br> This was what I wish'd for, and immediately leaving Friday and the Captain's Mate to their Business, I took the rest with me, and crossing the Creek out of their Sight, we surpriz'd the two Men before they were aware; one of them lying on Shore, and the other being in the Boat; the Fellow on Shore, was between sleeping and waking, and going to start up, the Captain who was foremost, ran in upon him, and knock'd him down, and then call'd out to him in the Boat, to yield, or he was a dead Man. 
<br> 
<br> There needed very few Arguments to perswade a single Man to yield, when he Saw five Men upon him, and his Comrade knock'd down; besides, this was it seems one of the three who were not so hearty in the Mutiny as the rest of the Crew, and therefore was easily perswaded, not only to yield, but afterwards to joyn very sincere with us. 
<br> 
<br> In the mean time, Friday and the Captain's Mate so well manag'd their Business with the rest, that they drew them by hollowing and answering, from one Hill to another, and from one Wood to another, till they not only heartily tyr'd them but left them, where they were very Sure they could not reach back to the Boat, before it was dark; and indeed they were heartily tyr'd themselves also by the Time they came back to us. 
<br> 
<br> We had nothing now to do, but to watch for them, in the Dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make sure work with them. 
<br> 
<br> It was several Hours after Friday came back to me, before they came back to their Boat; and we could hear the foremost of them long before they came quite up, calling to those behind to come along, and could also hear them answer and complain, how lame and tyr'd they were, and not able to -come any faster, which was very welcome News to us. 
<br> 
<br> At length they came up to the Boat; but 'tis impossible to express their Confusion, when they found the Boat fast a-Ground in the Creek, the Tide ebb'd out, and their two Men gone We could hear them call to one another in a most lamentable Manner, telling one another, they were gotten into an inchanted Island; that either there were Inhabitants in it, and they should all be murther'd, or else there were Devils and Spirits in it, and they should be all carry'd away, and devour'd. 
<br> 
<br> They hallow'd again, and call'd their two Comerades by their Names, a great many times, but no Answer. After some time, we could see them, by the little Light there was, run about wringing their Hands like Men in Despair; and that sometimes they would go and sit down in the Boat to rest themselves, then come ashore again, and walk about again, and so over the same thing again. 
<br> 
<br> My Men would fain have me given them Leave to fall upon them at once in the Dark; but I was willing to take them at some Advantage, so to spare them, and kill as few of them as I could; and especially I was unwilling to hazard the killing any of our own Men, knowing the other were very well armed. I resolved to wait to see if they did not separate; and therefore to make sure of them, I drew my Ambuscade nearer, and order'd Friday and the Captain, to creep upon their Hands and Feet as close to the Ground as they could, that they might not be discover'd, and get as near them as they could possibly, before they offered to fire. 
<br> 
<br> They had not been long in that Posture, but that the Boatswain, who was the principal Ringleader of the Mutiny, and had now shewn himself the most dejected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking towards them with two more of their Crew; the Captain was so eager, as having this principal Rogue so much in his Power, that he could hardly have Patience to let him come so near, as to be sure of him; for they only heard his Tongue before: But when they came nearer, the Captain and Friday starting up on their Feet, let fly at them. 
<br> 
<br> The Boatswain was kill'd upon the Spot, the next Man was Shot into the Body, and fell just by him, tho' he did not die 'till an Hour or two after; and the third run for it. 
<br> 
<br> At the Noise of the Fire, I immediately advanc'd with my whole Army, which was now 8 Men, viz. my self Generalissimo, Friday my Lieutenant-General, the Captain and his two Men, and the three Prisoners of War, who we had trusted with Arms. 
<br> 
<br> We came upon them indeed in the Dark, so that they could not see our Number; and I made the Man we had left in the Boat, who was now one of us, call to them by Name, to try if I could bring them to a Parley, and so might perhaps reduce them to Terms, which fell out just as we desir'd: for deed it was easy to think, as their Condition then was, they would be very willing to capitulate; so he calls out as loud as he could, to one of them, Tom Smith, Tom Smith; Tom Smith answered immediately, Who's that, Robinson? for it seems he knew his Voice: T'other answered, Ay, ay; for God's Sake, Tom Smith, throw down your Arms, and yield, or, you are all dead Men this Moment. 
<br> 
<br> Who must me yield to? where are they? (says Smith again;) Here they are: says he, here's our Captain, and fifty Men with him, have been hunting you this two Hours; the Boatswain is kill'd, Will Frye is wounded, and I am a Prisoner; and if you do not yield, you are all lost. 
<br> 
<br> Will they give us. Quarter then, (says Tom Smith) and we will yield? I'll go and ask, if you promise to yield, says Robinson; So he ass:'d the Captain, and the Captain then calls himself out, You Smith, you know my Voice, if you lay down your Arms immediately, and submit, you shall have your Lives all but Will. Atkins. 
<br> 
<br> Upon this, Will Atkins cry'd out, For God's Sake, Captain, give me Quarter, what have I done? They have been all as bad as I, which by the Way was not true neither; for it seems this Will. Atkins was the first Man that laid hold of the Captain, when they first mutiny'd, and used him barbarously, in tying his Hands, and giving him injurious Language. However, the Captain told him he must lay down his Arms at Discretion, and trust to the Governour's Mercy, by which he meant me; for they all call'd me Governour. 
<br> 
<br> In a Word, they all laid down their Arms, and begg'd their Lives; and I sent the Man that had parley'd with them, and two more, who bound them all; and then my great Army of 50 Men, which particularly with those three, were all but eight, came up and seiz'd upon them all, and upon their Boat, only that I kept my self and one more out of Sight, for Reasons of State. 
<br> 
<br> Our next Work was to repair the Boat, and think of seizing the Ship; and as for the Captain, now he had Leisure to parley with them: He expostulated with them upon the Villany of their Practices with him, and at length upon the farther Wickedness of their Design, and how certainly it must bring them to Misery and Distress in the End, and perhaps to the Gallows. 
<br> 
<br> They all appear'd very penitent, and begg'd hard for their Lives; as for that, he told them, they were none of his Prisoners, but the Commander of the Island; that they thought they had set him on Shore in a barren uninhabited Island, but it had pleased God so to direct them, that the Island was inhabited, and that the Governour was an English Man; that he might hang them all there, if he pleased; but as he had given them all Quarter, he supposed he would send them to England to be dealt with there, as Justice requir'd, except Atkins, who he was commanded by the Governour to advise to prepare for Death; for that he would be hang'd in the Morning. 
<br> 
<br> Though this was all a Fiction of his own, yet it had its desired Effect; Atkins fell upon his Knees to beg the Captain to interceed with the Governour for his Life; and all the rest beg'd of him for God's Sake, that they might not be sent to England. 
<br> 
<br> It now occurr'd to me, that the time of our Deliverance was come, and that it would be a most easy thing to bring these Fellows in, to be hearty in getting Possession of the Ship; so I retir'd in the Dark from them, that they might not see what Kind of a Governour they had, and call'd the Captain to me; when I call'd, as at a good Distance, one of the Men was order'd to speak again, and say to the Captain, Captain, the Commander calls for you; and presently the Captain reply'd, Tell his Excellency, I am just a coming: This more perfectly amused' them; and they all believed that the Commander was just by with his fifty Men. 
<br> 
<br> Upon the Captain's coming to me, I told him my Project for seizing the Ship, which he lik'd of wonderfully well, and resolv'd to put it in Execution the next Morning. 
<br> 
<br> But in Order to execute it with more Art, and secure of Success, I told him, we must divide the Prisoners, and that he should go and take Atkins and two more of the worst of them, and send them pinion'd to the Cave where the others lay: This was committed to Friday and the two Men who came on Shore with the Captain. 
<br> 
<br> They convey'd them to the Cave, as to a Prison; and it was indeed a dismal Place, especially to Men in their Condition. 
<br> 
<br> The other I order'd to my Bower, as I call'd it, of which I have given a full Description; and as it was fenc'd in, and they pinion'd, the Place was secure enough, considering they were upon their Behaviour. 
<br> 
<br> To these in the Morning I sent the Captain, who was to enter into a Parley with them, in a Word to try them, and tell me, whether he thought they might be trusted or no, to on Board and surprize the Ship. He talk'd to them of the Injury done him, of the Condition they were brought to; and that though the Governour had given them Quarter for their Lives, as to the present Action, yet that if they were sent to England, they would all be hang'd in Chains, to be sure; but that if they would join in so just an Attempt, as to recover the Ship, he would have the Governour's Engagement for their Pardon. 
<br> 
<br> Any one may guess how readily such a Proposal would be accepted by Men in their Condition; they fell down on their Knees to the Captain, and promised with the deepest Imprecations, that they would be faithful to him to the last Drop, and that they should owe their Lives to him, and would go with him all over the World, that they would own him for a Father to them as long as they liv'd. 
<br> 
<br> Well, says the Captain, I must go and tell the Governour what you say, and see what I can do to bring him to consent to it: So he brought me an Account of the Temper he found them in; and that he verily believ'd they would be faithful. 
<br> 
<br> However, that we might be very secure, I told him he should go back again, and choose out five of them, and tell them, they might see that he did not want Men, that he would take out those five to be his Assistants, and that the Governour would keep the other two, and the three that were sent Prisoners to the Castle, (my Cave) as Hostages, for the Fidelity of those five; and that if they prov'd unfaithful in the Execution, the five Hostages should be hang'd in Chains alive upon the Shore. 
<br> 
<br> This look'd severe, and convinc'd them that the Governour was in Earnest; however they had no Way left them, but to accept it; and it was now the Business of the Prisoners, as much as of the Captain, to perswade the other five to do their Duty. 
<br> 
<br> Our Strength was now thus ordered for the Expedition: 1. The Captain, his Mate, and Passenger. 2. Then the two Prisoners of the first Gang, to whom having their Characters from the Captain, I had given their Liberty, and trusted them with Arms. 3. The other two who I had kept till now, in my Bower, pinion'd; but upon the Captain's Motion, had now releas'd. These five releas'd at last: So that they were twelve in all, besides five we kept Prisoners in the Cave, for Hostages. 
<br> 
<br> I ask'd the Captain, if he was willing to venture with these Hands on Board the Ship; for as for me and my Man Friday, I did not think it was proper for us to stir, having seven Men left behind; and it was Employment enough for us to keep them assunder, and supply them with Victuals. 
<br> 
<br> As to the five in the Cave, I resolv'd to keep them fast, but Friday went in twice a Day to them, to supply them with Necessaries; and I made the other two carry Provisions to a certain Distance, where Friday was to take it. 
<br> 
<br> When I shew'd my self to the two Hostages, it was with the Captain, who told them, I was the Person the Governour had order'd to look after them, and that it was the Governour's Pleasure they should not stir any where, but by my Direction; that if they did, they should be fetch'd into the Castle, and be lay'd in Irons; so that as we never suffered them to see me as Governour, so I now appear'd as another Person, and Spoke of the Governour, the Garrison, the Castle, and the like, upon all Occasions. 
<br> 
<br> The Captain now had no Difficulty before him, but to furnish his two Boats, Stop the Breach of one, and Man them. He made his Passenger Captain of one, with four other Men; and himself, and his Mate, and five more, went in the other: And they contriv'd their Business very well; for they came up to the Ship about Midnight: As soon as they came within Call of the Ship, he made Robinson hale them, and tell them they had brought off the Men and the Boat, but that it was a long time before they had found them, and the like holding them in a Chat 'till they came to the Ship's Side when the Captain and the Mate entring first with their Arms, immediately knock'd down the second Mate and Carpenter, with the But-end of their Muskets, being very faithfully seconded by their Men, they secur'd all the rest that were upon the Main and Quarter Decks, and began to fasten the Hatches to keep them down who were below, when the other Boat and their Men entring at the fore Chains, secur'd the Fore-Castle of the Ship, and the Scuttle which went down into the Cook Room, making three Men they found there, Prisoners. 
<br> 
<br> When this was done, and all safe upon Deck, the Captain order'd the Mate with three Men to break into the Round-House where the new Rebel Captain lay, and having taken the Alarm, was gotten up, and with two Men and a Boy had gotten Fire Arms in their Hands, and when the Mate with a Crow split open the Door, the new Captain and his Men fir'd boldly among them, and wounded the Mate with a Musket Ball which broke his Arm, and wounded two more of the but kill'd no Body. 
<br> 
<br> The Mate calling for Help, rush'd however into the Round-House, wounded as he was, and with his Pistol shot the new Captain thro' the Head, the Bullet entring at his Mouth, and came out again behind one of his Ears; so that he never spoke a Word; upon which the rest yielded, and the Ship was taken effectually, without any more Lives lost. 
<br> 
<br> As soon as the Ship was thus secur'd, the Captain order'd seven Guns to be fir'd, which was the Signal agreed upon with me, to give me Notice of his Success, which you may be sure I was very glad to hear, having sat watching upon the Shore for it till near two of the Clock in the Morning. 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 为了解决这一问题，我便开动脑筋。我让星期五叫他俩坐在河边，让他自己到我身边来。不久，我们便做了一副类似担架的东西。我们把他俩放上去，我和星期五一前一后抬着他俩往前走。可是，抬到住所围墙外面时，我们却又不知怎么办才好了。因为要把他们两人背过墙去是绝对不可能的，但我又不愿拆坏围墙。于是，我和星期五只好动手搭个临时帐篷。不到两小时帐篷就搭成了，而且样子也挺不错。帐篷顶上盖的是旧帆布，帆布上又铺上树枝。帐篷就搭在我们外墙外面的那块空地上；也就是说，在外墙和我新近种植起来的那片幼林之间。在帐篷里，我们用一些现在的稻草搭了两张地铺，上面各铺了一条毯子，再加上一条毯子作盖被。 
<br> 
<br> 现在，我这小岛上已经有了居民了；我觉得自己已有了不少百姓。我不禁觉得自己犹如一个国王。每想到这里，心里有一种说不出的喜悦。首先，整个小岛都是我个人的财产，因此，我对所属的领土拥有一种毫无异义的主权；其次，我的百姓对我都绝对臣服，我是他们的全权统治者和立法者。他们对我都感恩戴德，因为他们的性命都是我救下来的。假如有必要，他们个个都甘心情愿为我献出他们自己的生命。还有一点值得一提的是，我虽然只有三个臣民，但他们却分属三个不同的宗教：星期五是新教徒；他的父亲是异教徒，而且还是个吃人的生番；而那个西班牙人却又是个天主教徒。可是，在我的领土上，我允许宗教信仰自由。当然，这些只是在这儿顺便提提罢了。
<br> 
<br> 我解救出来的两个俘虏身体已十分虚弱。我首先把他们安顿好，使他们有遮风避雨和休息的地方，然后，就想到给他们弄点吃的东西。我先叫星期五从羊圈里挑了一只不大不小的山羊把它宰了。我把山羊的后半截剁下来，切成小块，叫星期五加上清水煮，又在汤里加了点小麦和大米，制成味道鲜美的羊肉糊汤。这顿饭是在露天做的，因为我从不在内墙里面生火做饭。羊肉糊汤烧好后，我就端到新帐篷里去，又在那里替他们摆上一张桌子，坐下来和他们一块吃起来，同时和他们又说又笑，尽可能鼓其他们的精神。谈话时，星期五就充当我的翻译，除了把我的话翻给他父亲听以外，有时也翻给那西班牙人听，因为那西班牙人说他们部落的话已相当不错了。
<br> 
<br> 吃完了中饭，或者不如说吃完了晚饭，我就命令星期五驾一只独木船，把我们的短枪和其他枪枝搬回来，因为当时时间仓促，这些武器仍留在战场上。第二天，我又命令他把那几个野人的尸体埋掉，因为尸体在太阳下暴晒，不久就会发臭。我也叫他把他们那场野蛮的人肉宴所剩下来的残骨剩肉也一齐顺便埋掉。我知道那些残骸还剩有不少，可我实在不想自己亲自动手去埋掉--不要说埋，就是路过都不忍看一眼。所有这些工作，星期五都很快就完成了，而且，他把那群野人留在那一带的痕迹都消灭得干干净净。后来我再到那边去时，要不是靠了那片树林的一角辩别方向，简直认不出那个地方了。
<br> 
<br> 我和我两个新到的臣民进行了一次简短的谈话。首先，我让星期五问问他父亲，那几个坐独木船逃掉的野人会有什么结果，并问他，他是否认为，他们会带大批野人卷土重来，人数可能会多得我们难以抵抗。他的第一个反应是，那条小船必然逃不过那天晚上的大风；那些野人不是淹死在海里，就是给大风刮到南方其他海岸上去了。假如被刮到那边去的话，他们必然会被当地的野人吃掉；而如果他们的小船出事的话，也必然会淹死。至于说，万一他们真能平安抵达自己的海岸，他们可能会采取什么行动，星期五的父亲说，那他就很难说了。不过，照他看来，他们受到我们的突然袭击，被我们的枪声和火光已吓得半死，所以他相信，他们回去以后，一定会告诉自己部落里的人，说那些没有逃出来的人，是给霹雳和闪电打死的，而不是给敌人打死的。至于那两个在他们面前出现的人，也就是我和星期五，他们一定以为是从天上下来消灭他们的天神或复仇之神，因为他亲耳听到他们用自己部族的土话把这意思传来传去。他们怎么也不能想象，人居然又会喷火，又会放雷，而且连手都不抬一下，就会在远处把人打死。这位年迈的野人说的果然不错。因为，后来事实证明，那些野人再也不敢到岛上来了。看来，那四个人居然从风浪里逃出性命，回到了自己的部落。部落里的人听了他们四人的报告，简直吓坏了。他们一致相信，任何人到这魔岛上来，都会被天神用火烧死。
<br> 
<br> 当然，我开始不知道上述情况。所以，有很长一段时间，整天提心吊胆，带着我的全部军队严加防守。我感到，我们现在已有四个人了，哪怕他们来上一百人，只要在平坦空旷的地方，我都敢跟他们干一仗。
<br> 
<br> 过了一些时候，并没有见野人的独木舟出现，我害怕他们反攻的担心也就渐渐消失了，并重又开始考虑坐船到大陆上去的老问题。我之所以重新考虑这个问题，还有另一个原因，那就是，星期五的父亲向我保证，我若到他们那儿去，他们全部族的人一定会看在他的面上，十分友好地接待我。
<br> 
<br> 可是，当我和那西班牙人认真交谈之后，又把这个念头暂时收起来了。因为他告诉我，目前他们那边还有十六个西班牙人和葡萄牙人。他们自从船只遇难，逃到那边之后，确实也和那些野人相处得很好，但生活必需品却十分匮乏，连活都活不下去了。我仔细询问了他们的航程，才知道他们搭的是一条西班牙船，从拉普拉塔河出发，前往哈瓦那②，准备在哈瓦那卸货，船上主要装的是起货和银子，然后再看看有什么欧洲货可以运回去。他们船上有五个葡萄牙水手，是从另一条遇难船上救下来的。后来他们自己的船也出事了，淹死了五个西班牙船员，其余的人经过无数艰难危险，逃到那些食人生番聚居的海岸时，几乎都快饿死了；上岸后，他们也无时无刻不担心给那些野人吃掉。
<br> 
<br> 他又告诉我，他们本来也随身带了一些枪械，但因为既无火药，又无子弹，所以毫无用处。原来他们所有的弹药都给海水浸湿了，身边仅剩的一点点，也在他们初上岸时，打猎充饥用完了。
<br> 
<br> 我问他，在他看来，那些人结果会怎样，有没有逃跑的打算。他说，他们对这件事也曾商量过许多次，但一没船，二没造船的工具，三没粮食，所以商量来商量去，总是没有结果，往往以眼泪和失望收常我又问他，如果我向他们提出一个使他们逃生的建议，在他看来，他们是否会接受？如果让他们都到我这岛上来，这件事能否实现？我很坦率地告诉他，我最怕的是，一旦我把自己的生命交到他们的手里，他们说不定会背信弃义，恩将仇报。因为感恩图报并非是人性中固有的美德，而且，人们往往不是以其所受的恩惠来行动，更多的时候，他们是根据他们所希望获得的利益来行动的。我又告诉他，假如我帮助他们脱离险境，而结果他们反而把我当作俘虏，押送到新西班牙去，那对我来说处境就相当危险了。因为英国人一到那里，就必定会受到宗教迫害，不管他是出于不得已的原因去的，还是偶然到那里的。我说，我宁可把生命交给那些野人，让他们活活把我吃掉，也不愿落到那些西班牙僧侣的手里，受宗教法庭的审判。我又补充说，假如他们不会背弃我的话，我相信，只要他们到岛上来，我们有这么多人手，就一定可以造一条大船，把我们大家一齐载走，或向南开往巴西，或向北开往西印度群岛或西班牙海岸。可是，如果我把武器交到他们手中，他们反而恩将仇报，用武力把我劫持到西班牙人那里去，我岂不是好心不得好报，处境反而比以前更糟了吗？
<br> 
<br> 听了我的话，他回答说，他们当前处境非常悲惨，而且吃足了苦头，所以，他深信，他们对任何能帮助他们脱险的人，绝不会有忘恩负义的念头。他说这些话时，态度极为诚恳坦率。同时，他又说，如果我愿意的话，他可以同老黑人一齐去见他们，同他们谈谈这件事，然后把他们的答复带回来告诉我。他说他一定会跟他们订好条件，叫他们郑重宣誓，绝对服从我的领导，把我看作他们的司令和船长；同时，还要让他们用《圣经》和《福音书》宣誓对我效忠到底，不管我叫他们到哪一个基督教国家去，都要毫无异议地跟我去，并绝对服从我的命令，直到他们把我送到我所指定的地方平安登陆为止。最后，他又说，他一定要叫他们亲手签订盟约，并把签约带回来见我。
<br> 
<br> 接着他又对我说，他愿意首先向我宣誓，没有我的命令，他一辈子也不离开我；万一他的同胞有什么背信弃义的事情，他将和我一齐战斗，直至流尽最后一滴血。
<br> 
<br> 他还告诉我，他们都是很文明、很正直的人，目前正在危难之中；他们既没有武器，也没有衣服，也没有食物，命运完全掌握在野人的手里。他们没有重返故乡的希望。因此，他敢保证，只要我肯救他们脱离大难，他们一定愿意跟我一起出生入死。
<br> 
<br> 听了他这一番保证，我决定尽一切可能冒一下险救他们出来，并想先派那老野人和这位西班牙人渡海过去同他们交涉。可是，当我们一切准备妥当，正要派他们出发时，那个西班牙人忽然自己提出了反对意见。他的意见不仅考虑慎重周到，而且出乎至诚，使我十分高兴。于是，我听从了他的劝告，把搭救他同伴的计划延迟了一年半。情况是这样的：这位西班牙人和我们一起，已生活了个把月了。在这一个月里，我让他看到，在老天爷的保佑下，我是用什么方法来维持自己的生活的。同时，他也清楚地看到我的粮食储备究竟有多少。这点粮食我一个人享用当然绰绰有余，但如果不厉行节约，就不够现在一家人吃了，因为我现在家里的成员已增加到四口人。如果他的几位同胞从对岸一起过来，那是肯定不够吃的。据他说，他们那边还有十四个人活着。如果我们还要造条船，航行到美洲的一个基督教国家的殖民地去，这点粮食又怎么够全船的人一路上吃呢？因此，他对我说，他认为最好让他和星期五父子再开垦一些土地，把我能省下来的粮食全部做种子，通通播下去，等到再收获一季庄稼之后，再谈这个问题。这样，等他的同胞过来之后，就有足够的粮食吃了。因为，缺乏生活必需品，往往会引起大家的抱怨，或者他们会认为自己出了火坑，又被投入了大海。
<br> 
<br> "你知道，"他说，"以色列人当初被救出埃及时感到高兴，但在旷野里缺乏面包时，他们甚至反叛了拯救他们的上帝。"他的顾虑完全是合情合理的，他的建议也非常好，所以，我不仅对他的建议非常赏识，而且对他的忠诚也极为满意。于是，我们四个人就一起动手用那些木头工具掘地。不到一个月工夫，就开垦好一大片土地，赶在播种季节之前，正好把地整理好。我们在这片新开垦的土地上，种下了二十二斛大麦和十六罐大米--总之，我们把能省下来的全部粮食都当作种子用了。实际上，在收获以前的六个月中间，我们所保留下来的大麦甚至还不够我们吃的。这六个月，是指从我们把种子储存起来准备播种算起；在这儿热带地区，从播种到收获是不需要六个月的。
<br> 
<br> 现在，我们已有不少居民，即使那些野人再来，也不用害怕了，除非他们来的人数特别多。所以，我们只要有机会，就可在全岛到处自由来往。由于我们的脑子里都想着逃走和脱险的事情，所以大家都无时无刻不在想办法，至少我自己是如此。为了这个目的，我把几棵适于造船的树做了记号，叫星期五父子把它们砍倒。然后，我又把自己的意图告诉那西班牙人，叫他监督和指挥星期五父子工作。我把自己以前削好的一些木板给他们看，告诉他们我是怎样不辞辛劳地把一棵大树削成木板的，并叫他们照着去做。最后，他们居然用橡树做成了十二块很大的木板，每块约二英尺宽，三十五英尺长，二至四英寸厚。至于这项工作究竟花费了多么艰巨的劳动，那就可想而知了。
<br> 
<br> 同时，我又想尽办法把我那小小的羊群繁殖起来。为此，我让星期五和那西班牙人头一天出去，我和星期五的父亲第二天出去，采用这种轮流出动的办法，捉了二十多只小山羊，把它们和原有的羊圈养在一起。因为每当我们打到母羊，就把小羊留起来送到羊群中去饲养。此外，更重要的是，当晒制葡萄的季节到来时，我叫大家采集了大量的葡萄，把它们挂在太阳底下晒干。要是我们在生产葡萄干著称的阿利坎特，我相信，我们这次制成的葡萄干可以足足装满六十至八十大桶。葡萄干和面包是我们日常生活的主要食品，而且葡萄干又好吃，又富于营养，对改善我们的生活起了很大的作用。
<br> 
<br> 收获庄稼的季节到了，我们的收成不错，尽管这不能说是岛上的丰收年，但收获的粮食也足够应付我们的需要了。我们种下去的二十斛大麦，现在居然收进并打出来了二百二十多斛；稻米收成的比例也差不多。这些存粮，就是那边十六个西班牙人通通到我们这边来，也足够我们吃到下一个收获季节；或者，如果我们准备航海的话，也可以在船上装上足够的粮食。有了这些粮食，我们可以开到世界上任何地方去--我是说，可以开到美洲大陆的任何地方去。
<br> 
<br> 我们把收获的粮食收藏妥当后，大家又动手编制更多的藤皮--也就是编制一些大筐子用来装存粮。那西班牙人是个编藤皮的好把手，做得又好又快，而且老怪我以前没有编更多的藤皮作防御之用，但我看不出有什么必要。
<br> 
<br> 现在，我们已有了粮食，足够供应我所盼望的客人了，我就决定让那西班牙人到大陆上去走一趟，看看有什么办法帮助那批还留在那边的人过来。临行之前，我向他下了严格的书面指示，即任何人，如果不先在他和那老野人面前发誓，表明上岛之后决不对我进行任何伤害或攻击的，都不得带到岛上来。因为我是好心把他们接过来，准备救他们脱险的。同时，还要他们发誓，在遇到有人叛变的时候，一定要和我站在一起，保卫我，并且无论到什么地方，都要绝对服从我的指挥。我要求他们把这些条件都写下来，并亲笔签名。我知道他们那边既无笔，也无纸，他们怎么能把这一切写下来并亲笔签名呢？可是，这一点我们大家都没有问过。
<br> 
<br> 那个西班牙人和那个老野人，也就是星期五的父亲，在接受了我的这些指示后就出发了。他们坐的独木船，当然就是他们上岛时坐的其中的一只。更确切地说，当初他们是被那伙野人当作俘虏用其中的一只独木船载到岛上来的，而那伙野人把他们载到岛上来是准备把他们杀了吃掉的。
<br> 
<br> 我还给了他们每人一支短枪，都带着燧发机，又给了他们八份弹药，吩咐他们尽量节约使用，不到紧急关头都不要用。
<br> 
<br> 这是一件令人愉快的工作，因为二十七年来，这是第一次我为解救自己所采取的实际步骤。我给了他们许多面包和葡萄干，足够他们吃好几天，也足够那批西班牙人吃上七八天。于是我祝他们一路平安，送他们动身。同时，我也同他们约定好他们回来时船上应悬挂的信号。这样，他们回来时，不等靠岸我老远就可把他们认出来了。
<br> 
<br> 他们出发时，正好是顺风。据我估计，那是十月中旬月圆的一天。至于准确的日期，自从我把日历记错后，就再也弄不清楚了；我甚至连年份有没有记错都没有把握。但后来我检查我的记录时，发现年份倒没有记错。
<br> 
<br> 他们走后，我刚刚等到第八天，忽然发生了一件意外的事情。这件事那么奇特，那么出人意料，也许是有史以来闻所未闻的。那天早晨，我在自己的茅舍里睡得正香，忽然星期五跑进来，边跑边嚷："主人，主人，他们来了！他们来了！
<br> 
<br> "我立即从床上跳起来，不顾一切危险，急忙披上衣服，穿过小树林（现在它已长成一片浓密的树林了），跑了出来。我说不顾一切危险，意思是我连武器都没有带就跑出来了。这完全违反了我平时的习惯。当我放眼向海上望去时，不觉大吃一惊。只见四五海里之外，有一只小船，正挂着一副所谓"羊肩帆"向岸上驶来。当时正好顺风，把小船直往岸上送。
<br> 
<br> 接着我就注意到，那小船不是从大陆方向来的，而是从岛的最南端驶过来的。于是我把星期五叫到身边，叫他不要离开我。因为，这些人不是我们所期待的人，现在还不清楚他们是敌是友。
<br> 
<br> 然后，我马上回家去取望远镜，想看看清楚他们究竟是些什么人。我搬出梯子，爬上山顶。每当我对什么东西放心不下，想看个清楚，而又不想被别人发现，就总是爬到这山上来了望。
<br> 
<br> 我一上小山，就看见一条大船在我东南偏南的地方停泊着，离我所在处大约有七八海里，离岸最多四五海里。我一看就知道，那是一艘英国船，而那只小船样子也是一条英国长艇。
<br> 
<br> 我当时混乱的心情实难言表。一方面，我看到了一艘大船，而且有理由相信船上有我的同胞，是自己人，心里有一种说不出的高兴。然而，另一方面，我心里又产生了一种怀疑。我不知道这种怀疑从何而来，但却促使我警惕起来。首先，我想，一条英国船为什么要开到这一带来呢？因为这儿不是英国人在世界上贸易往来的要道。其次，我知道，近来并没有发生过什么暴风雨，不可能把他们的船刮到这一带来。
<br> 
<br> 如果他们真的是英国人，他们到这一带来，一定没安好心。我与其落到盗贼和罪犯手里，还不如像以前那样过下去。
<br> 
<br> 有时候，一个人明明知道不可能有什么危险，但心里却会受到一种神秘的暗示，警告我们有危险。对于这种暗示和警告，任何人都不能轻视。我相信，凡是对这类事情稍稍留意的人，很少人能否认可以得到这种暗示和警告。同时，不容置疑的是，这种暗示和警告来自一个看不见的世界，是与幽灵或天使的交流。如果这种暗示是向我们发出警告，要我们注意危险，我们为什么不可以猜想，这种暗示和警告来自某位友好的使者呢？至于这位使者是至高无上，还是低微下贱，那无关紧要，重要的是，这种暗示和警告是善意的。
<br> 
<br> 当前发生的情况，充分证明我的这种想法完全正确。不管这种神秘的警告从何而来，要是没有这一警告，我就不可能分外小心，那我早已大祸临头，陷入比以往更糟的处境了。
<br> 
<br> 我这么说是完全有理由的，下面我要叙述的情况就完全可以证明这一点。
<br> 
<br> 我在小山上了望了没多久，就看见那只小船驶近小岛。他们好像在寻找河湾，以便把船开进来上岸。但他们沿着海岸走得不太远，所以没有发现我从前卸木排的那个小河湾，只好把小船停在离我半英里远的沙滩上靠岸。这对我来说是十分幸运的。因为，如果他们进入河湾，就会在我的家门口上岸。那样的话，他们就一定会把我从城堡里赶走，说不定还会把我所有的东西抢个精光呢！
<br> 
<br> 他们上岸之后，我看出他们果然都是英国人，至少大部分是英国人。这使我非常高兴。其中有一两个看样子像荷兰人，但后来证明倒并不是荷兰人。他们一共有十一个人，其中三个好像没有带武器，而且仿佛被绑起来似的。船一靠岸，就有四五个人首先跳上岸，然后把三个人押下船来。我看到其中有一个正在那里指手划脚，作出种种恳求、悲痛和失望的姿势，其动作真有点过火。另外两个人我看到有时也举起双手，显出很苦恼的样子，但没有第一个人那样激动。
<br> 
<br> 我看到这幅情景，真有点莫名其妙，不知他们究竟在搞什么名堂。星期五在旁边一直用英语对我喊道："啊，主人，你看英国人也吃俘虏，同野人一样！""怎么，星期五，"我说，"你以为他们会吃那几个人吗？""是的，"星期五说，"他们一定会吃的。""不会，不会，"我说，"星期五，我看他们会杀死他们，但决不会吃他们，这我敢担保！"这时，我不知道眼前发生的一切究竟是怎么回事，只是站在那里，看着这可怕的情景发抖，并一直担心那三个俘虏会给他们杀掉。有一次，我看到一个恶棍甚至举起一把水手们称为腰刀的那种长刀，向其中一个可怜的人砍去，眼看他就要倒下来了。这使我吓得不寒而栗。
<br> 
<br> 我这时恨不得那西班牙人和那老野人还在我身边，可惜他们一起走掉了；我也恨不得自己能有什么办法神不知鬼不觉地走到他们前面，走到我枪弹的射程以内，把那三个人救出来。因为我看到他们这伙人都没有带枪支。但后来我想到了另外的办法。
<br> 
<br> 我看到，那伙盛气凌人的水手把那三个人横暴地虐待一番之后，都在岛上四散走开了，好像想看看这儿的环境。同时，我也发现，那三个俘虏的行动也很自由，但他们三个人都在地上坐了下来，一副心事重重和绝望的样子。
<br> 
<br> 这使我想起自己第一次上岸的心情。那时，我举目四顾，认定自己必死无疑了；我惶惶然四处张望，最后怕给野兽吃掉，提心吊胆地在树上栖息了一夜。
<br> 
<br> 那天晚上，我万万没有想到，老天爷会让风暴和潮水把大船冲近海岸，使我获得不少生活必需品；后来正是靠了这些生活必需品我才活了下来，并一直活到今天。同样，那三个可怜的受难者也不会想到，他们一定会获救，而且不久就会获救。他们也决不会想到，就在他们认为肯定没命或毫无出路时，他们实际上是完全安全了。
<br> 
<br> 有时，我们的目光是多么短浅啊！而我们应该完全信任造物主的理由又是多么充分啊！造物主从来不会让他自己所创造的生灵陷于绝境。即使是在最恶劣的环境里，他总会给他们一线生路；有时候，他们的救星往往近在眼前，比他们想象的要近得多。不但如此，他们有时似乎已陷入绝境，而实际上却是给他们安排好的获救的出路。
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 这些人上岸时，正是潮水涨得最高的时候。他们中一部分人站在那里同俘虏谈判，另一部分人在四周东逛西逛，看看他们究竟到了什么地方，无意间错过了潮汛。结果海水退得很远，把他们的小船搁浅在沙滩上。
<br> 
<br> 他们本来有两个人留在小船上。可是，据我后来了解，他俩因白兰地喝得多了点而睡着了。后来，其中一个先醒来，看见小船搁浅了，推又推不动，就向那些四散在各处的人大声呼唤。于是，他们马上都跑到小船旁去帮忙。可是，小船太重，那一带的海岸又是松软的沙土，简直像流水一样。所以，他们怎么使劲也无法把船推到海里去。
<br> 
<br> 水手大概是全人类中最顾前不顾后的家伙了。因此，在这种情况下，他们干脆放弃了这个工作，又去四处游荡了。我听见一个水手向另一个水手大声说话，叫他离开小船："算了吧，杰克，别管它了。潮水上来，船就会浮起来的。"我一听这两句话，就证实他们是哪国人了。
<br> 
<br> 到目前为止，我一直把自己严密的隐蔽起来，除了上小山顶上的观察所外，不敢离开自己的城堡一步。想到自己城堡的防御工事非常坚固，我心里感到很高兴。我知道那小船至少要过十小时才能浮起来。到那时，天也差不多黑了，我就可以更好地观察他们的行动，偷听他们的谈话了。
<br> 
<br> 与此同时，我像以前那样作好战斗准备。这一次，我比过去更加小心，因为我知道，我要对付的敌人与从前是完全不一样的。现在，我已把星期五训练成一个很高明的射手了。
<br> 
<br> 我命令他也把自己武装起来。我自己拿了两支鸟枪，给了他三支短枪。我现在的样子，真是狰狞可怕：身上穿件羊皮袄，样子已够吓人，头上戴顶大帽子，那古怪劲儿我前面也曾提到过。腰间照常挂着一把没有刀鞘的刀，皮带上插了两支手枪，双肩上各背了一支枪。
<br> 
<br> 上面我已经说过，我不想在天黑之前采取任何行动。下午两点钟左右，天气最热。我发现他们都三三两两地跑到树林里，大概去睡觉了。那三个可怜的人，深为自己目前的处境忧虑，睡也睡不着，只好在一棵大树的荫凉下呆呆地坐着，离我大约一百多码远。而且，看样子其他人看不见他们坐的地方。
<br> 
<br> 看到这种情况，我决定走过去了解一下他们的情况。我马上向他们走过去。我上面说了，我的样子狰狞可怕；我的仆人星期五远远地跟在我后面，也是全副武装，样子像我一样可怕，但比我稍好一些，不像我那样，像个怪物。
<br> 
<br> 我悄悄走近他们，还没等到他们看见我，我就抢先用西班牙语向他们喊道：
<br> 
<br> "先生们，你们是什么人？"一听到喊声，他们吃了一惊，可一看到我的那副怪模样，更是惊恐万分，连话都说不出来了。我见他们要逃跑的样子，就用英语对他们说："先生们，别害怕。也许，你们想不到，在你们眼前的人，正是你们的朋友呢！""他一定是天上派下来的，"其中一个说，并脱帽向我致礼，神情十分认真。
<br> 
<br> "因为我们的处境非人力所能挽救得了。""一切拯救都来自天上，先生，"我说，
<br> 
<br> "你们看来正在危难之中，你们能让一个陌生人来帮助你们吗？你们上岸时，我早就看见了。你们向那些蛮横的家伙哀求的时候，其中有一个人甚至举起刀来要杀害你们呢！这一切我都看到了。"那可怜的人泪流满面，浑身发抖，显得十分惊异。他回答说："我是在对上帝说话呢，还是在对人说话？你是人，还是天使？""这你不用担心，先生，"我说，"如果上帝真的派一位天使来拯救你们，他的穿戴一定会比我好得多，他的武器也一定完全不一样。请你们放心吧。我是人，而且是英国人。你们看，我是来救你们的。我只有一个仆人。我们都有武器。请你们大胆告诉我们，我们能为你们效劳吗？你们到底发生了什么事？""我们的事，先生，
<br> 
<br> "他说，"说来话长，而我们的凶手又近在咫尺。现在，就长话短说吧，先生。我是那条船的船长，我手下的人反叛了。我好不容易才说服他们不杀我。最后，他们把我和这两个人一起押送到这个岛上来。他们一个是我的大副，一个是旅客。我们想，在这个荒岛上，我们一定会饿死的。我们相信，这是一个没有人烟的荒岛，真不知道怎么办呢！""你们的敌人，那些暴徒，现在在什么地方？"我问，
<br> 
<br> "你们知道他们到哪儿去啦？""他们正在那边躺着呢，先生。"他指着一个灌木林说。"我现在心里吓得直发抖，怕他们看到我们，听到你说话。要那样的话，我们通通没命了！""他们有没有枪支？"我问。他回答说，他们只有两支枪，一支留在船上了。"那就好了，"我说，"一切由我来处理吧。
<br> 
<br> 我看到他们现在都睡着了，一下子就可把他们都杀掉。不过，是不是活捉更好？"他对我说，其中有两个是亡命之徒，决不能饶恕他们。只要把这两个坏蛋解决了，其余的人就会回到自己的工作岗位上去。我问是哪两个人。他说现在距离太远，看不清楚，不过他愿意服从我的指挥行动。"那好吧，"我说，"我们退远一点，免得给他们醒来时看到或听到。回头我们再商量办法吧。"于是，他们高兴地跟着我往回走，一直走到树林后面隐蔽好。
<br> 
<br> "请你听着，先生，"我说，"我如果冒险救你们，你们愿意和我订两个条件吗？
<br> 
<br> "他没等我把条件说出来，就先说，只要把大船收复回来，他和他的船完全听从我的指挥。如果船收复不回来，他也情愿与我共生死，同存亡；我要上哪儿就上哪儿。另外两个人也同样这样说。
<br> 
<br> "好吧，"我说，"我只有两个条件。第一，你们留在岛上期间，决不能侵犯我在这里的主权；如果我发给你们武器，无论什么时候，只要我向你们要回，你们就得交还给我。你们不得在这岛上反对我或我手下的人，并必须完全服从我的管理。第二，如果那只大船收复回来，你们必须把我和我的人免费送回英国。"他向我提出了种种保证，凡是想得到和使人信得过的保证，通通提出来了。他还说，我的这些要求是完全合情合理的，他将会彻底履行；同时，他还要感谢我的救命之恩，终身不忘。
<br> 
<br> "那好吧，"我说，"现在我交给你们三支短枪，还有火药和子弹。现在，你们看，下一步该怎么办？"他一再向我表示感谢，并说他情愿听从我的指挥。我对他说，现在的事情很棘手。不过，我认为，最好趁他们现在还睡着，就向他们开火。如果第一排枪放过后还有活着的，并且愿意投降，那就可以饶他们的命。至于开枪之后能打死多少人，那就只好听从上帝的安排了。
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 船长心地十分善良。他说，能不杀死他们就尽量不要杀死他们。只是那两个家伙是不可救药的坏蛋，是船上暴动的祸首。留着他们，我们自己必定会遭殃。他们回到船上，就会发动全体船员反叛，把我们通通杀掉！"那好吧，"我说，"我的建议也是出于不得已，因为这是救我们自己的唯一的办法。"然而，我看他还是很不愿意杀人流血，所以便对他说，这事不妨由他们自己去办，怎样干方便就怎样干吧。
<br> 
<br> 正当我们在谈话的时候，听见他们中间有几个人醒来了。
<br> 
<br> 又过了不一会儿，看到有两个人已经站了起来。我问船长这两个人中有没有谋反的头子，他说，"没有。""那好吧，"我说，"你就让他们逃命吧。看样子是老天爷有意叫醒他们，让他们逃命的。可是，如果你让其余的人跑掉，那就是你的错了。"听了我的话，他受到了激励，就把我给他的短枪拿在手里，又把一支手枪插在皮带上。他的两个伙伴也跟着他一起去了，每人手里也都拿着一支枪。他那两个伙伴走在前面，大概弄出了一点声响，那两个醒来的水手中，有一人听到了响动，转过身来看到了他们，就向其余的人大声叫唤，但已经太迟了。他刚一叫出声，他们就开枪了。开枪的是船长的两个伙伴。至于那船长，他很乖巧，没有开枪。他们都瞄得很准，当场打死了一个，另一个也受了重伤，但还没死。他一头爬起来，急忙向其余的人呼救。这时船长已一步跳到他跟前，对他说，现在呼救已太晚了，他应该祈求上帝宽恕他的罪恶。说着，船长用枪把一下子把他打倒在地，叫他再也开不了口。跟那两个水手在一起的还有其余三个人，其中有一个已经受了轻伤。就在这时，我也到了。他们看到了危险临头，知道抵抗已没有用了，就只好哀求饶命。船长告诉他们，他可以饶他们的命，但他们得向他保证，表示痛恨自己所犯的反叛的罪行，并宣誓效忠船长，帮他把大船夺回来，然后再把他们开回牙买加去，因为他们正是从牙买加来的。他们竭力向船长表示他们的诚意，船长也愿意相信他们，并饶他们的命。对此我也并不反对，只是要求船长在他们留在岛上期间，应把他们的手脚绑起来。
<br> 
<br> 与此同时，我派星期五和船长手下的大副到那小船上去，命令他们把船扣留起来，并把上面的几只桨和帆拿下来。他们都一一照办了。不一会，有三个在别处闲逛的人因听到了枪声，这时也回来了。算他们运气，没有跟其余人在一块。他们看见他们的船长，不久前还是他们的俘虏，现在却一下子变成了他们的征服者，也就俯首就缚。这样，我们就大获全胜。
<br> 
<br> 现在，船长和我已经有时间来打听彼此的情况了。我先开口，把我全部经历告诉了他。他全神贯注地听着我讲，显出无限惊异的神情。特别是在我讲到怎样用奇妙的方式弄到粮食和军火时，更显得惊讶万分。他听了我的故事，大为感动，因为我的经历，实在是一连串的奇迹。可是当他从我的故事联想到自己的遭遇，想到上帝仿佛有意让我活下来救他的命时，他不禁泪流满面，连话都说不出来了。
<br> 
<br> 谈话结束后，我把他和他的两个伙伴带到我的住所。我照样用梯子翻墙而过。到了家里，我拿出面包和葡萄干之类我常备的食品招待他们，还把我多年来制造的种种设备指给他们看。
<br> 
<br> 我的谈话，以及我所做的一切，都使他们感到十分惊讶。
<br> 
<br> 船长特别欣赏我的防御工事，欣赏我用一片小树林把住宅完全隐蔽起来。这片小树林现在已经栽了二十年了，由于这里树木比英国长得快，现在已经成了一片小小的森林，而且十分茂密。我在树林里保留了一条弯弯曲曲的小径，其他任何地方都走不进来。我告诉他，这是我的城堡和住宅，但是，像许多王公贵人一样，我在乡间还有一所别墅。如果需要，我可以去那儿休养一段时期。我说，以后有时间，我可以带他们到那儿去看看，但目前我们的首要任务是要考虑收复那只大船的问题。船长同意我的看法，可是，他说，他一时想不出什么办法，因为大船上还有二十六个人。他们既已参加了叛乱，在法律上已犯了死罪，因此已别无出路，只好一不做二不休，硬干到底。因为，他们知道，如果失败了，一回英国或任何英国殖民地，他们就会被送上绞架。但光靠我们这几个人，是无法向他们进攻的。
<br> 
<br> 我对他的话沉思了一会儿，觉得他的结论很有道理，因而觉得必须迅速作出决定。一方面，可以用出其不意的办法，把船上的那伙人引入某种圈套；另一方面，得设法阻止他们上岸攻打我们，消灭我们。这时候，我立刻想到，再过一会儿，大船上的船员不见小船和他们伙伴的动静，一定会感到奇怪；那时，他们就会坐上大船上的另一只长艇上岸来找他们。他们来时，说不定还会带上武器，实力就会大大超过我们。船长听了我的话，认为很有道理。
<br> 
<br> 于是，我告诉他，我们首先应该把搁浅在沙滩上的那只小船凿破，把船上所有的东西都拿下来，使它无法下水，他们就无法把它划走。于是我们一起上了小船，把留在上面的那支枪拿了下来，又把上面所能找到的东西通通拿下来。其中有一瓶白兰地，一瓶甘蔗酒，几块饼干，一角火药，以及一大包用帆布包着的糖，大约有五六磅重。这些东西我都非常需要，尤其是糖和白兰地，我已吃光好多年了。
<br> 
<br> 船上的桨呀，桅杆呀，帆呀，舵呀等东西，早已经拿走了。所以，我们把剩下的这些东西搬上岸之后，又在船底凿了一个大洞。这样一来，即使他们有充分的实力战胜我们，也没法把小船划走。
<br> 
<br> 说实话，我认为收复大船的把握不大。我的看法是，只要他们不把那只小船弄走，我们就可以把它重新修好。那样，我们就可乘它去利华德群岛，顺便把那些西班牙朋友也可带走。因为我心里还时刻记着他们。
<br> 
<br> 我们立即按计划行事。首先，我们竭尽全力，把小船推到较高的沙滩上。这样，即使潮水上涨，也不致把船浮起来；何况，我们已在船底凿了个大洞，短时间内无法把洞补好。正当我们坐在地上，寻思着下一步计划时，只听见大船上放了一枪，并且摇动旗帜发出信号，叫小船回去。可是，他们看不见小船上有任何动静。于是，接着又放了几枪，并向小船又发出了一些别的信号。
<br> 
<br> 最后，他们见信号和放枪都没有用处，小船还是没有任何动静。我们在望远镜里看见他们把另一只小船放下来，向岸上摇来。当他们逐渐靠近时，我们看出小船上载着不下十来人，而且都带着枪支。
<br> 
<br> 那条大船停泊在离岸大约六海里的地方。他们坐小船划过来时，我们看得清清楚楚，连他们的脸也认得出来。他们向岸上划来时，潮水把他们冲到第一只小船的东边去了。于是他们又沿着海岸往西划，直奔第一只小船靠岸和停泊的地方。
<br> 
<br> 这就是说，我们把他们看得一清二楚，船长说得出船上的人谁是谁，以及他们的性格品行。他说，其中有三个人非常老实；他相信，他们之所以参与谋反，是因为受到其他人的威吓，而他们又人少势单，因而是被迫的。
<br> 
<br> 那水手长似乎是他们的头目。他和其余的几个人都是船员中最凶狠的家伙。现在，他们既然发动了叛乱，就一定要硬干到底了。因此，船长非常担心，他们实力太强，我们难以取胜。
<br> 
<br> 我向他微微一笑，对他说，处于我们这种境遇的人，早已无所畏惧了。反正任何一种遭遇都比我们当前的遭遇要强些，因此，我们应有思想准备，不管结果是死是活，对我们来说都是一种解脱。我问他对我的处境有何看法，为了获得解脱，是否值得冒险？"先生，"我说，"你刚才还认为，上帝让我活在这里是为了拯救你的生命，并使你稍稍振作了一下精神。现在，你的这种信念到哪里去了呢？对我来说，只有一件事使我感到遗憾。""什么事？"他问。"那就是你说的，他们当中有三个老实人，我们应饶他们的命。如果他们也都是暴徒，我真会认为是上帝有意把他们挑出来送到你手里来的呢。因为，我敢担保，凡是上岸的人，都将成为我们的俘虏。
<br> 
<br> 他们是死是活，要看他们对我们的态度而定了。"我说话时，声音很高，脸带笑容。这大大鼓起了船长的勇气。于是，我们立即开始作战斗准备。当我们一看到他们放下小船，就考虑到要把俘虏分散。这件事我们已作了妥善的安置。
<br> 
<br> 俘虏中有两个人，船长特别对他们不放心。我派星期五和船长手下的一个人把这两个人送到我的洞室里去。那地方很远，决不会被人发现，或听到他们的呼救声；他们自己即使能逃出洞外，在树林里也找不到出路。他们把这两个人都绑了起来安置在洞里，但照样供给他们吃喝，并答应他们，如果他们安安静静地呆在洞里，一两天之后就恢复他们的自由；但如果他们企图逃跑，就格杀勿论。他们都老老实实地保证，愿意被关起来，耐心等待，并感谢我们对他们的优待，给他们吃喝，还给他们点灯。因为星期五还给了他们几支蜡烛，都是我们自己做的，这样不致让他们在黑暗中受煎熬。当然，他们万万没有想到，星期五一直在洞口站岗，看守着他们。
<br> 
<br> 其余的俘虏受到的待遇要好些。有两个一直没有松绑，因为船长对他们仍不放心，但另外两个受到了我的录用，这是由于船长的推荐。同时，他们本人也慎重宣誓，要与我们共存亡。因此，加上他们和船长一伙好人，我们一共是七个人，都是全副武装。我毫不怀疑，我们完全能对付即将上岛的那十来个人，更何况船长说过，其中还有三四个好人呢。
<br> 
<br> 那批人来到头一只小船停泊的地方，马上把他们自己的小船推到沙滩上，船上的人也通通下了船，一起把小船拉到岸上。看到这一情况，我心里非常高兴。因为我就怕他们把小船在离岸较远的地方下锚，再留几个人在船上看守。那样我们就没法夺取小船了。
<br> 
<br> 一上岸，他们首先一起跑去看前一只小船。不难看出，当他们发现船上空空如也，船底上有一个大洞，个个都大吃一惊。
<br> 
<br> 他们把眼前看到的情况寻思了一会儿，就一起使劲大喊了两三次，想叫他们的同伴听见。可是毫无结果。接着，他们又围成一圈，放了一排枪。这起枪声我们当然听见了，而且枪声的回声把树林都震响了。可是结果还是一样。那些关在洞里的，自然听不见；那些被我们看守着的，虽然听得很清楚，却不敢作任何反应。
<br> 
<br> 这事大大出乎他们的意料，使他们万分惊讶。事后他们告诉我们，他们当时决定回到大船上去，告诉船上的人说，那批人都给杀光了，长艇也给凿沉了。于是，他们马上把小船推到水里，一起上了船。
<br> 
<br> 看到他们的这一举动，船长非常吃惊，简直不知怎么办好了。他相信，他们一定会回到大船上去，把船开走，因为他们一定认为他们的伙伴都已没命了。那样的话，他原来想收复大船的希望就落空了。可是，不久，他看到那批人又有了新的举动，又一次使他惶恐不安起来。
<br> 
<br> 他们把船划出不远，我们看到他们又一起重新回到岸上。
<br> 
<br> 这次行动他们采取了新的措施。看来，他们刚才已商量好了。
<br> 
<br> 那就是，留三个人在小船上，其余的人一齐上岸，深入小岛去寻找他们的伙伴。
<br> 
<br> 这使我们大失所望，简直不知怎么办才好。因为如果我们让小船开跑，即使我们把岸上的七个人通通抓住，那也毫无用处。那三个人必然会把小船划回大船，大船上的人必然会起锚扬帆而去，那我们收复大船的希望同样会落空。
<br> 
<br> 可是，我们除了静候事情的发展，别无良策。那七个人上岸了。三个留在船上的人把船划得离岸远远的，然后下锚停泊等岸上的人。这样一来，我们也无法向小船发动攻击。
<br> 
<br> 那批上岸的人紧紧走在一起，向那小山头前进。而那小山下，就是我的住所。我们可以把他们看得清清楚楚，可他们根本看不到我们。他们若走近我们，倒是求之不得，因为近了我们就可以向他们开枪。他们若索性走远点也好，这样我们可以到外面去。
<br> 
<br> 在小山顶上，他们可以看见那些山谷和森林远远地向东北延伸，那是岛上地势最低的地方。他们一上山顶，就一个劲地齐声大喊大叫，一直喊得喊不动为止。看来他们不想远离海岸，深入小岛腹地冒险，也不愿彼此分散。于是，他们就坐在一棵树下考虑办法。如果他们也像前一批人那样，决定先睡一觉，那倒成全了我们的好事。可是，他们却非常担心危险，不敢睡觉，尽管他们自己也不知道究竟有什么危险。
<br> 
<br> 他们正在那里聚在一起商量的时候，船长向我提出了一个建议；这建议确实合情合理。那就是，他们或许还会开一排枪，目的是想让他们的伙伴听见。我们应趁他们刚开完枪，就一拥而上。那时他们只好束手就擒，我们就可以不流一滴血把他们制服。我对这个建议很满意。但是，我们必须尽量接近他们，在他们来不及装上弹药前就冲上去。
<br> 
<br> 可是，他们并没有开枪。我们悄悄地在那里埋伏了很久，不知怎么办才好。最后，我告诉他们，在我看来，天黑之前我们不能采取任何行动。但到了晚上，如果他们不回到小船上去，我们也许可以想出什么办法包抄到他们和海岸中间，用什么策略对付那几个小船上的人，引他们上岸。
<br> 
<br> 我们又等了很久，心里忐忑不安，巴不得他们离开。只见他们商议了半天，忽然一起跳起来，向海边走去。这一下，我们心里真有点慌了。看来，他们很害怕这儿真有什么危险，并认为他们那些伙伴都已完蛋了，所以决定不再寻找他们，回大船上去继续他们原定的航行计划。
<br> 
<br> 我一见他们向海边走去，马上猜到他们已放弃搜寻，准备回去了。事实也确实如此。我把我的想法告诉了船长，他也为此十分担忧，心情沉重极了。可是，我很快想出了一个办法把他们引回来，后来也真的达到了我的目的。
<br> 
<br> 我命令星期五和那位大副越过小河往西走，一直走到那批野人押着星期五登陆的地方，并叫他们在半英里外的那片高地上，尽量大声叫喊，一直喊到让那些水手听见为止。我又交待他们，在听到那些水手回答之后，再回叫几声，然后不要让他们看见，兜上一个大圈子，一面叫着，一面应着，尽可能把他们引往小岛深处。然后，再按照我指定的路线迂回到我这边来。
<br> 
<br> 那些人刚要上小船，星期五和大副就大声喊叫起来。他们马上听见了，就一面回答，一面沿海岸往西跑。他们朝着喊话的方向跑去。跑了一阵，他们就被小河挡住了去路。当时小河正值涨水，他们没法过河，只好把那只小船叫过来，渡他们过去。一切都在我意料之中。
<br> 
<br> 他们渡过河后，我发现小船已向上游驶了一段路程，进入了一个好像内河港口的地方。他们从船上叫下一个人来跟他们一块走，所以现在船上只留下两个人了，小船就拴在一根小树桩上。
<br> 
<br> 这一切正合我的心愿。我让星期五和大副继续干他们的事，自己马上带其余的人偷偷渡过小河，出其不意地向那两个人扑过去。当时，一个人正躺在岸上，一个人还在船里呆着。那岸上的人半睡半醒，正想爬起来，走在头里的船长一下冲到他跟前，把他打倒在地。然后，船长又向船上的人大喝一声，叫他赶快投降，否则就要他的命。
<br> 
<br> 当一个人看到五个人向他扑来，而他的同伴又已被打倒，叫他投降是用不着多费什么口舌的。而且，他又是被迫参加叛乱的三个水手之一，所以，他不但一下子就被我们降服了，而且后来还忠心耿耿地参加到我们这边来。
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 与此同时，星期五和大副也把对付其余几个人的任务完成得很出色。他们一边喊，一边应，把他们从一座小山引向另一座小山，从一片树林引向另一片树林，不但把那批人搞得筋疲力竭，而且把他们引得很远很远，不到天黑他们是绝不可能回到小船上来的。不用说，就是星期五他们自己，回来时也已劳累不堪了。
<br> 
<br> 我们现在已无事可做，只有在暗中监视他们，准备随时向他们进攻，坚决把他们打败。
<br> 
<br> 星期五他们回来好几小时后，那批人才回到了他们小船停泊的地方。我们老远就能听到走在头里的几个向掉在后面的几个大声呼唤着，要他们快点跟上。又听到那后面的几个人一面答应着，一面叫苦不迭，说他们又累又脚痛，实在走不快了。这对于我们确实是一个好消息。
<br> 
<br> 最后，他们总算走到了小船跟前。当时潮水已退，小船搁浅在小河里，那两个人又不知去向，他们那种惊慌失措的样子，简直无法形容。我们听见他们互相你呼我唤，声音十分凄惨。他们都说是上了一个魔岛，岛上不是有人，就是有妖怪。如果有人，他们必然会被杀得一个不剩；如果有妖怪，他们也必然会被妖怪抓走，吃个精光。
<br> 
<br> 他们又开始大声呼唤，不断地喊着他们那两个伙伴的名字，可是毫无回音。又过了一会儿，我们从傍晚暗淡的光线下看见他们惶惶然地跑来跑去，双手扭来扭去，一副绝望的样子。他们一会儿跑到小船上坐下来休息，一会儿又跑到岸上，奔来奔去。如此上上下下，反复不已。
<br> 
<br> 这时，我手下的人恨不得我允许他们趁着夜色立即向他们扑上去。可是我想找一个更有利的机会向他们进攻，给他们留一条生路，尽可能少杀死几个。我尤其不愿意我们自己人有伤亡，因为我知道对方也都是全副武装的。我决定等待着，看看他们是否会散开。因此，为了更有把握制服他们，我命令手下人再向前推进埋伏起来，并让星期五和船长尽可能贴着地面匍匐前进，尽量隐蔽，并在他们动手开枪之前，爬得离他们越近越好。
<br> 
<br> 他们向前爬了不多一会儿，那水手长就带着另外两个水手朝他们走来。这水手长是这次叛乱的主要头目，现在比其他人更垂头丧气。船长急不可耐，不等他走近看清楚，就同星期五一起跳起来向他们开了枪。他们只是凭对方的声音行动的。
<br> 
<br> 那水手长当场给打死了。另一个身上中弹受伤，倒在水手长身旁，过了一两小时也死了。第三个人拔腿就跑。
<br> 
<br> 我一听见枪响，立即带领全军前进。我这支军队现在一共有八个人，那就是：我，总司令；星期五，我的副司令。另外是船长和他的两个部下。还有三个我们信得过的俘虏，我们也发给了他们枪。
<br> 
<br> 趁着漆黑的夜色，我们向他们发动了猛攻。他们根本看不清我们究竟有多少人。那个被他们留在小船上的人，现在已是我们的人了。我命令他喊那些水手的名字，看看能否促使他们和我们谈判，强其他们投降。结果我们如愿以偿。因为不难理解，他们处在当前的情况下是十分愿意投降的。于是，他尽量提高嗓门，喊出他们中间一个人的名字："汤姆·史密斯！汤姆·史密斯！"汤姆·史密斯似乎听出了他的声音，立即回答说："是鲁宾孙吗？"那个人恰好也叫鲁宾孙。他回答说："是啊，是我！看在上帝份上，汤姆·史密斯，快放下武器投降吧！要不你们马上都没命了。""我们向谁投降？他们在哪儿？"史密斯问。"他们在这儿，"他说。"我们船长就在这儿，带了五十个人，已经搜寻你们两小时了。水手长已给打死了。维尔·佛莱也已受伤。我被俘虏了。你们不投降就完蛋了！""我们投降，
<br> 
<br> "史密斯说，"他们肯饶我们命吗？""你们肯投降，我就去问问看，"鲁宾孙说。他就问船长。这时，船长亲自出来喊话了。"喂，史密斯，你听得出，这是我的声音。
<br> 
<br> 只要你们放下武器投降，我就饶你们的命，只有威尔·阿金斯除外。"听到这话，威尔·阿金斯叫喊起来："看在上帝份上，船长，饶了我吧！我做了什么呢？他们都和我一样坏。"但事实并非像他说的。因为，从当时情况来看，在他们这次发动叛乱的时候，正是这个威尔·阿金斯首先把船长抓起来，对船长的态度十分蛮横。他把船长的两只手绑起来，又用恶毒的语言谩骂船长。这时，船长告诉他，他必须首先放下武器，然后听候总督处理。所谓总督，指的就是我，因为现在他们都叫我总督。
<br> 
<br> 简而言之，他们都放下了武器，请求饶命。于是，我派那个和他们谈判的人以及另外两个水手，把他们通通绑起来。
<br> 
<br> 然后，我那五十人的大军--其实，加上他们三人，我们总共才只八个人--便上去把他们和他们的小船一起扣起来。
<br> 
<br> 我和另一个人因身份关系，暂不露面。
<br> 
<br> 我们下一步工作就是把那凿破的小船修好，并设法把大船夺回来。而船长这时也有时间与他们谈判了。他向他们讲了一番大道理，指出他们对待他的态度如何恶劣，他们的居心如何邪恶，并告诉他们，他们的所作所为，最后一定给自己带来不幸和灾难，甚至会把他们送上绞刑架。
<br> 
<br> 他们一个个表示悔罪，苦苦哀求饶命。对此，船长告诉他们，他们不是他的俘虏，而是岛上主管长官的俘虏。他说，他们本来以为把他送到了一个杳无人烟的荒岛上，但上帝要他们把他送到有人居住的岛上，而且，岛上还有一位英国总督。他说，如果总督认为必要，就可以把他们通通在岛上吊死。但现在他决定饶恕他们，大概要把他们送回英国，秉公治罪。但阿金斯除外。总督下令，要阿金斯准备受死，明天早晨就要把他吊死。
<br> 
<br> 这些话虽然都是船长杜撰出来的，然而却达到了预期的效果。阿金斯跪下来哀求船长向总督求情，饶他一命。其余的人也一起向船长哀求，要他看在上帝份上，不要把他们送回英国。
<br> 
<br> 这时我忽然想到，我们获救的时刻到了。现在把这些人争取过来，让他们全心全意去夺取那只大船，已非难事。于是我在夜色中离开了他们，免得他们看见我是怎样的一个总督。然后，我把船长叫到身边。当我叫他的时候，因为已有相当的距离，就派了一个人去传话，对船长说："船长，司令叫你。"船长马上回答说："回去告诉阁下，我就来。"这样一来，就使他们更加深信不疑了。他们都相信，司令和他手下的五十名士兵就在附近。
<br> 
<br> 船长一到，我就把夺船的计划告诉他。船长认为计划非常周密，就决定第二天早晨付诸实施。
<br> 
<br> 但是，为了把计划执行得更巧妙，更有成功的把握，我对船长说，我们必须把俘虏分开处理。首先，他应去把阿金斯和另外两个最坏的家伙绑起来，送到我们拘留另外几个人的那个石洞里去。这件事我们交给星期五和那两个跟船长一起上岸的人去办了。
<br> 
<br> 星期五等人把俘虏押解到石洞里，好像把他们投入监牢一样。事实上，那地方也确实够凄凉的，尤其是对于他们这种处境的人，更是阴森可怕。
<br> 
<br> 我又命令把其余的俘虏送到我的乡间别墅里去。关于这别墅，我前面已作过详尽的叙述。那边本来就有围墙，他们又都被捆绑着，所以把他们关在那里相当可靠。再说，他们也知道，他们的前途决定于他们自己的表现，因此谁都不敢轻举妄动。
<br> 
<br> 到了早晨，我便派船长去同他们谈判，目的是要他去摸摸他们的底，然后回来向我汇报，看看派他们一起去夺回大船是否可靠。船长跟他们谈到他们对他的伤害以及他们目前的处境。他又对他们说，虽然现在总督已饶了他们的命，可是，如果把他们送回英国，他们还是会给当局用铁链吊死的。
<br> 
<br> 不过，如果他们肯参加夺回大船的正义行动，他一定请求总督同意赦免他们。
<br> 
<br> 任何人都不难想象，处在他们的境况下，对于这个建议，真是求之不得。他们一起跪在船长面前，苦苦哀求，答应对他誓死效忠，并且说，他们将永远感激他救命之恩，甘愿跟他走遍天涯海角，还要毕生把他当作父亲一样看待。
<br> 
<br> "好吧，"船长说，"我现在回去向总督汇报，尽力劝他同意赦免你们。"于是，他回来把他们当前思想情况原原本本地向我作了汇报，并且说，他完全相信他们是会效忠的。
<br> 
<br> 话虽如此，为了保险起见，我叫船长再回去一趟，从他们七个人中挑出五个人来。我要他告诉那些人，他现在并不缺少人手，现在只要挑选五个人做他助手，总督要把其余两个人以及那三个已经押送到城堡里去的俘虏留下来作人质，以保证参加行动的那五个人的忠诚。如果他们在执行任务过程中有任何不忠诚的表现，留在岛上的五个人质就要在岸上用铁链活活吊死。
<br> 
<br> 这个办法看起来相当严厉，使他们相信总督办事是很认真的，他们除了乖乖接受外，别无办法。结果，那几个俘虏反而和船长一样认真，劝告参加行动的五个人尽力尽责。
<br> 
<br> 我们出征的兵力是这样的：一，船长、大副、旅客；二，第二批俘虏中的两个水手。我从船长口里了解了他们的品行，早已恢复了他们的自由，并发给了他们武器；三，另外两个水手。这两个人直到现在还被捆绑着关在我的别墅里，现经船长建议，也把他们释放了；四，那五个最后挑选出来的人。
<br> 
<br> 因此，参加行动的一共是十三人。留在岛上的人质是七个人，五个关在城堡的石洞里，两个没有关起来。
<br> 
<br> 我问船长，他是否愿意冒险带领这些人去收复大船。我认为，我和星期五不宜出动，因为岛上还有七个俘虏，而且他们又都被分散看守着，还得供给他们饮食，也够我们忙的了。
<br> 
<br> 我决定牢牢看守好关在洞里的那五个人。我让星期五一天去两次，给他们送些食品去。我要其他两个人先把东西送到一个指定的地点，然后再由星期五送去。
<br> 
<br> 当我在那两个人质面前露面时，我是同船长一起去的。船长向他们介绍，我是由总督派来监视他们的。总督的命令是，没有我的指示，他们不得乱跑。如果乱跑，就把他们抓起来送到城堡里去，用铁链子锁起来。这样，为了不让他们知道我就是总督，我现在是以另一个人的身份出现，并不时地向他们谈到总督、驻军和城堡等问题。
<br> 
<br> 船长现在只要把两只小船装备好，把留在沙滩上的那只小船的洞补好，再分派人员上去，别的就没有什么困难了。他指定他的旅客作一条小船的船长，带上另外四名水手。他自己、大副和另外五名水手，上了另一条小船。他们的事情进行得很顺利。到了半夜，他们已到了大船旁。当他们划到能够向大船喊话时，船长就命令那个叫鲁宾孙的水手同他们招呼，告诉他们人和船都已回来了，他们是花了好多时间才把人和船找回来的。他们一面用这些话敷衍着，一面靠拢了大船。当小船一靠上大船，船长和大副首先带枪上了船。这时，手下的人表现得很忠诚。在他们的协助下船长和大副一下子就用枪把子把二副和木匠打倒了。紧接着他们又把前后甲板上的其他人全部制服，并关好舱口，把舱底下的人关在下面。
<br> 
<br> 这时，第二只小船上的人也从船头的铁索上爬上来，占领了船头和通厨房的小舱口，并把在厨房里碰到的三个人俘虏了起来。
<br> 
<br> 这一切完成后，又肃清了甲板，船长就命令大副带三个人进攻艉楼甲板室，去抓睡在那里做了新船长的叛徒。这时，那新船长已听到了警报，从床上爬起来。他身边有两个船员和一个小听差，每人手里都有枪。当大副用一根铁橇杠把门劈开时，那新船长和他手下的人就不顾一切地向他们开火。一颗短枪子弹打伤了大副，把他的胳膊打断了，还打伤了其他两个人，但没有打死人。
<br> 
<br> 大副虽然受了伤，还是一面呼救，一面冲进船长室，用手枪朝新船长头上就是一枪；子弹从他嘴里进去，从一只耳朵后面出来，他再也说不出一句话了。其余的人看到这情形，也都投降了。于是，大船就这样稳稳当当地夺了过来，再也没有死一个人。
<br> 
<br> 占领大船后，船长马上下令连放七枪。这是我和他约定的信号，通知我事情成功了。不用说，听到这个信号我是多么高兴。因为我一直坐在岸边等候这个信号，差不多一直等到半夜两点钟。
