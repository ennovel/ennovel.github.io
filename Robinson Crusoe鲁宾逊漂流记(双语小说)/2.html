<br> 
<br> September 30, 1659. I poor miserable Robinson Crusoe, being shipwreck'd, during a dreadful Storm, in the offing, came on Shore on this dismal unfortunate Island, which I call'd the Island of Despair, all the rest of the Ship's Company being drown'd, and my self almost dead. 
<br> 
<br> All the rest of that Day I spent in afflicting my self at the dismal Circumstances I was brought to, viz. I had neither Food, House, Clothes, Weapon, or Place to fly to, and in Despair of any Relief, saw nothing but Death before me, either that I should be devour'd by wild Beasts, murther'd by Savages, or starv'd to Death for Want of Food. At the Approach of Night, I slept in a Tree for fear of wild Creatures, but slept soundly tho' it rain'd all Night. 
<br> 
<br> October 1. In the Morning I saw to my great Surprise the Ship had floated with the high Tide, and was driven on Shore again much nearer the Island, which as it was some Comfort on one hand, for seeing her sit upright, and not broken to Pieces, I hop'd, if the Wind abated, I might get on board, and get some Food and Necessaries out of her for my Relief; so on the other hand, it renew'd my Grief at the Loss of my Comrades, who I imagin'd if we had all staid on board might have sav'd the Ship, or at least that they would not have been all drown'd as they were; and that had the Men been sav'd, we might perhaps have built us a Boat out of the Ruins of the Ship, to have carried us to some other Part of the World. I spent great Part of this Day in perplexing my self on these things; but at length seeing the Ship almost dry, I went upon the Sand as near as I could, and then swam ings I wanted exceedingly for this Work, viz. A Pick-axe, a Shovel, and a Wheel-barrow or Basket, so I desisted from my Work, and began to consider how to supply that Want and make me some Tools; as for a Pickaxe, I made use of the Iron Crows, which were proper enough, tho' heavy; but the next thing was a Shovel or Spade, this was so absolutely necessary, that indeed I could do nothing effectually without it, but what kind of one to make I knew not. 
<br> 
<br> Nov. 18@“àoal Water, and the things being chiefly heavy, I recover'd many of them when the Tide was out. 
<br> 
<br> Oct. 25. It rain'd all Night and all Day, with some Gusts of Wind, during which time the Ship broke in Pieces, the Wind blowing a little harder than before, and was no more to be seen, except the Wreck of her, and that only at low Water. I spent this Day in covering and securing the Goods which I had sav'd, that the Rain might not spoil them. 
<br> 
<br> Oct. 26. I walk'd about the Shore almost all Day to find out a place to fix my Habitation, greatly concern'd to secure my self from an Attack in the Night, either from wild Beasts or Men. Towards Night I fix'd upon a proper Place under a Rock, and mark'd out a Semi-Circle for my Encampment, which I resolv'd to strengthen with a Work, Wall, or Fortification made of double Piles, lin'd within with Cables, and without with Turf. 
<br> 
<br> From the 26th. to the 30th. I work'd very hard in carrying all my Goods to my new Habitation, tho' some Part of the time it rain'd exceeding hard. 
<br> 
<br> The 31st. in the Morning I went out into the Island with my Gun to see for some Food, and discover the Country, when I kill'd a She-Goat, and her Kid follow'd me home, which I afterwards kill'd also because it would not feed. 
<br> 
<br> November. 1. I set up my Tent under a Rock, and lay there for the first Night, making it as large as I could with Stakes driven in to swing my Hammock upon. 
<br> 
<br> Nov. 2. I set up all my Chests and Boards, and the Pieces of Timber which made my Rafts, and with them form'd a Fence round me, a little within the Place I had mark'd out for my Fortification. 
<br> 
<br> Nov. 3. I went out with my Gun and kill'd two Fowls like Ducks, which were very good Food. In the Afternoon went to work to make me a Table. 
<br> 
<br> Nov. 4. This Morning I began to order my times of Work, of going out with my Gun, time of Sleep, and time of Diversion, viz. Every Morning I walk'd out with my Gun for two or three Hours if it did not rain, then employ'd my self to work till about Eleven a-Clock, then eat what I had to live on, and from Twelve to Two I lay down to sleep, the Weather being excessive hot, and then in the Evening to work again: The working Part of this Day and of the next were wholly employ'd in making my Table, for I was yet but a very sorry Workman, tho' Time and Necessity made me a compleat natural Mechanick soon after, as I believe it would do any one else. 
<br> 
<br> Nov. 5. This Day went abroad with my Gun and my Dog, and kill'd a wild Cat, her Skin pretty soft, but her Flesh good for nothing: Every Creature I kill'd I took off the skins and preserv'd them: Coming back by the Sea Shore, I saw many Sorts of Sea Fowls which I did not understand, but was surpris'd and almost frighted with two or three Seals, which, while I was gazing at, not well knowing what they were, got into the Sea and escap'd me for that time. 
<br> 
<br> Nov. 6. After my Morning Walk I went to work with my Table again, and finish'd it, tho' not to my liking; nor was it long before I learn'd to mend' it. 
<br> 
<br> Nov. 7. Now it began to be settled fair Weather. The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and Part of the 12th. (for the 11th was Sunday) I took wholly up to make me a Chair, and with much ado brought it to a tolerable Shape, but never to please me, and even in the making I pull'd it in Pieces several times. Note, I soon neglected my keeping Sundays, for omitting my Mark for them on my Post, I forgot which was which. 
<br> 
<br> Nov. 13. This Day it rain'd, which refresh'd me exceedingly, and cool'd the Earth, but it was accompany'd with ferrible Thunder and Lightning, which frighted me dreadfully for fear of my Powder; as soon as it was over, I resolv'd to separate my Stock of Powder into as many little Parcels as possible, that it might not be in Danger. 
<br> 
<br> Nov. 14, 15, 16. These three Days I spent in making little square Chests or Boxes, which might hold about a Pound or two Pound, at most, of Powder, and so putting the Powder in, I stow'd it in Places as secure and remote from one another as possible. On one of these three Days I kill'd a large Bird that was good to eat, but I know not what to call it. 
<br> 
<br> Nov. 17. This Day I began to dig behind my Tent into the Rock to make room for my farther Conveniency: Note, Two Things I wanted exceedingly for this Work, viz. A Pick-axe, a Shovel, and a Wheel-barrow or Basket, so I desisted from my Work, and began to consider how to supply that Want and make me some Tools; as for a Pickaxe, I made use of the Iron Crows, which were proper enough, tho' heavy; but the next thing was a Shovel or Spade, this was so absolutely necessary, that indeed I could do nothing effectually without it, but what kind of one to make I knew not. 
<br> 
<br> Nov. 18. The next Day in searching the Woods I found a Tree of that Wood, or like it, which, in the Brasils they call the Iron Tree, for Its exceeding Hardness, of this, with great Labour and almost spoiling my Axe, I cut a Piece, and brought it home too with Difficulty enough, for it was exceeding heavy. 
<br> 
<br> The excessive Hardness of the Wood, and having no other Way, made me a long while upon this Machine, for I work'd it effectually by little and little into the Form of a Shovel or Spade, the Handle exactly shap'd like ours in England, only that the broad Part having no Iron shod upon it at Bottom, it would not last me so long, however it serv'd well enough for the uses which I had occasion to put it to; but never was a Shovel, I believe, made after that Fashion, or so long a making. 
<br> 
<br> I was still deficient, for I wanted a Basket or a Wheelbarrow, a Basket I could not make by any Means, having no such things as Twigs that would bend to make Wicker Ware, at least none yet found out; and as to a Wheel-barrow, 
<br> 
<br> I fancy'd I could make all but the Wheel, but that I had no Notion of, neither did I know how to go about it; besides I had no possible Way to make the Iron Gudgeons for the Spindle or Axis of the Wheel to run in, so I gave it over, and so for carrying away the Earth which I dug out of the Cave, I made me a Thing like a Hodd, which the Labourers carry Morter in, when they serve the Bricklayers. 
<br> 
<br> This was not so difficult to me as the making the Shovel; and yet this, and the Shovel, and the Attempt which I made in vain, to make a Wheel-Barrow, took me up no less than four Days, I mean always, excepting my Morning Walk with my Gun, which I seldom fail'd, and very seldom fail'd also bringing Home something fit to eat. 
<br> 
<br> Nov. 23. My other Work having now stood still, because of my making these Tools; when they were finish'd, I went on, and working every Day, as my Strength and Time allow'd, I spent eighteen Days entirely in widening and deepening my Cave, that it might hold my Goods commodiously. 
<br> 
<br> Note, During all this Time, I work'd to make this Room or Cave spacious enough to accommodate me as a Warehouse or Magazin, a Kitchen, a Dining-room, and a Cellar; as for my Lodging, I kept to the Tent, except that some Times in the wet Season of the Year, it rain'd so hard, that I could not keep my self dry, which caused me afterwards to cover all my Place within my Pale with long Poles in the Form of Rafters leaning against the Rock, and load them with Flaggs and large Leaves of Trees like a Thatch. 
<br> 
<br> December 10th, I began now to think my Cave or Vault finished, when on a Sudden, (it seems I had made it too large) a great Quantity of Earth fell down from the Top and one Side, so much, that in short it frighted me, and not without Reason too; for if I had been under it I had never wanted a Grave-Digger: Upon this Disaster I had a great deal of Work to do over again; for I had the loose Earth to carry out; and which was of more Importance, I had the Seiling to prop up, so that I might be sure no more would come down. 
<br> 
<br> Dec. 11. This Day I went to Work with it accordingly, and got two Shores or Posts pitch'd upright to the Top, with two Pieces of Boards a cross over each Post, this I finish'd the next Day; and setting more Posts up with Boards, in about a Week more I had the Roof secur'd; and the Posts standing in Rows, serv'd me for Partitions to part of my House. 
<br> 
<br> Dec. 17. From this Day to the Twentieth I plac'd Shelves, and knock'd up Nails on the Posts to hang every Thing up that could be hung up, and now I began to be in some Order within Doors. 
<br> 
<br> Dec. 20. Now I carry'd every Thing into the Cave, and began to furnish my House, and set up some Pieces of Boards, like a Dresser, to order my Victuals upon, but Boards began to be very scarce with me; also I made me another Table. 
<br> 
<br> Dec. 24. Much Rain all Night and all Day, no stirring out. 
<br> 
<br> Dec. 25. Rain all Day. 
<br> 
<br> Dec. 26. No Rain, and the Earth much cooler than before, and pleasanter. 
<br> 
<br> Dec. 27. Kill'd a young Goat, and lam'd another so as that I catch'd it, and led it Home in a String; when I had it Home, I bound and splinter'd up its Leg which was broke, N.B. I took such Care of it, that it liv'd, and the Leg grew well, and as strong as ever; but by my nursing it so long it grew tame, and fed upon the little Green at my Door, and would not go away: This was the first Time that I entertain'd a Thought of breeding up some tame Creatures, that I might have Food when my Powder and Shot was all spent. 
<br> 
<br> Dec. 28, 29, 30. Great Heats and no Breeze; so that there was no Stirring abroad, except in the Evening for Food; this Time I spent in putting all my Things in Order within Doors. 
<br> 
<br> January 1. Very hot still, but I went abroad early and late with my Gun, and lay still in the Middle of the Day; this Evening going farther into the Valleys which lay towards the Center of the Island, I found there was plenty of Goats, tho' exceeding shy and hard to come at, however I resolv'd to try if I could not bring my Dog to hunt them down. 
<br> 
<br> Jan. 2. Accordingly, the next Day, I went out with my Dog, and set him upon the Goats; but I was mistaken, for they all fac'd about upon the Dog, and he knew his Danger too well, for he would not come near them. 
<br> 
<br> Jan. 3. I began my Fence or Wall; which being still jealous of my being attack'd by some Body, I resolv'd to make very thick and strong. 
<br> 
<br> N.B. This Wall being describ'd before, I purposely omit what was said in the Journal; it is sufficient to observe, that I was no less Time than from the 3rd of January to the 14th of April, working, finishing, and perfecting this Wall, tho' it was no more than about 24 Yards in Length, being a half Circle from one Place in the Rock to another Place about eight Yards from it, the Door of the Cave being in the Center behind it.
<br> All this Time I work'd very hard, the Rains hindering me many Days, nay sometimes Weeks together; but I thought I should never be perfectly secure `till this Wall was finish'd; and it is scarce credible what inexpressible Labour every Thing was done with, especially the bringing Piles out of the Woods, and driving them into the Ground, for I made them much bigger than I need to have done. 
<br> When this Wall was finished, and the Out-side double fenc'd with a Turff-Wall rais'd up close to it, I persuaded my self, that if any People were to come on Shore there, they would not perceive any Thing like a Habitation; and it was very well I did so, as may be oberv'd hereafter upon a very remarkable Occasion. 
<br> 
<br> During this Time, I made my Rounds in the Woods for Game every Day when the Rain admitted me, and made frequent Discoveries in these Walks of something or other to my Advantage; particularly I found a Kind of wild Pidgeons, who built not as Wood Pidgeons in a Tree, but rather as House Pidgeons, in the Holes of the Rocks; and taking some young ones, I endeavoured to bread them up tame, and did so; but when they grew older they flew all away, which perhaps was at first for Want of feeding them, for I had nothing to give them; however I frequently found their Nests, and got their young ones, which were very good Meat. 
<br> 
<br> And now, in the managing my houshold Affairs, I found my self wanting in many Things, which I thought at first it was impossible for me to make, as indeed as to some of them it was; for Instance, I could never make a Cask to be hooped, had a small Runlet or two, as I observed before, but I cou'd never arrive to the Capacity of making one by them, tho? I spent many Weeks about it; I could neither put in the Heads, or joint the Staves so true to one another, as to make them hold Water, so I gave that also over. 
<br> 
<br> In the next Place, I was at a great Loss for Candle; so that as soon as ever it was dark, which was generally by Seven-a-Clock, was oblig'd to go to Bed: I remembered the Lump of Bees-wax with which I made Candles in my African Adventure, but I had none of that now; the only Remedy had was, that when I had kill'd a Goat, sav'd the Tallow, and with a little Dish made of Clay, which I bak'd in the Sun, to which I added a Wick of some Oakum, I made me a Lamp; and this gave me Light, tho' not a clear steady Light like a Candle; in the Middle of all my Labours it happen'd, that rumaging my Things, I found a little Bag, which, as I hinted before, had been fill'd with Corn for the feeding of Poultry, not for this Voyage, but before, as I suppose, when nt my Wall. 
<br> 
<br> The very next Day after this Wall was finish'd, I had almost had all my Labour overthrown at once, and my self kill'd; the Case was thus, As I was busy in the Inside of it, behind my Tent, just in the Entrance into my Cave, I was terribly frighted with a most dreadful surprising Thing indeed; for all on a sudden I found the Earth come crumbling down from the Roof of my Cave, and from the Edge of the Hill over my Head, and two of the Posts I had set up in the Cave crack'd in a frightful Manner; I was heartily scar'd, but thought nothing' of what was really the Cause, only thinking that the Top of my Cave was falling in, as some of it had done before; and for Fear I shou'd be bury'd in it, I run foreward to my Ladder, and not thinking my self safe there neither, I got over my Wall for Fear of the Pieces of the Hill which I expected might roll down upon me: I was no sooner stepp'd down upon the firm Ground, but I plμ-E?à nay, as our English Barley. 
<br> 
<br> It is impossible to express the Astonishment and Confusion of my Thoughts on this Occasion; I had hitherto acted upon no religious Foundation at all, indeed I had very few Notions of Religion in my Head, or had' entertain'd any Sense of any Thing that had befallen me, otherwise than as a Chance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases God; without so much as enquiring into the End of Providence in these Things, or his Order in governing Events in the World: But after I saw Barley grow there, in a Climate which I know was not proper for Corn, and especially that I knew not how it came there, It startl'd me strangely, and I began to suggest, that God had miraculously caus'd this Grain to grow without any Help of Seed sown, and that it was so directed purely for my Sustenance, on that wild miserable Place. 
<br> 
<br> This touch'd my Heart a little, and brought Tears out of my Eyes, and I began to bless my self, that such a Prodigy of Nature should happen upon my Account; and this was the more strange to me, because I saw near it still all along by the Side of the Rock, some other straggling Stalks, which prov'd to be Stalks of Ryce, and which I knew, because I had seen it grow in Africa when I was ashore there. 
<br> 
<br> I not only thought these the pure Productions of Providence for my Support, but not doubting, but that there was more in the Place, I went all over that Part of the Island, where I had been before, peering in every Corner, and under every Rock, to see for more of it, but I could not find any; at last it occur'd to my Thoughts, that I had shook a Bag of Chickens Meat out in that Place, and then the Wonder began to cease; and I must confess, my religious Thankfulness to God's Providence began to abate too upon the Discovering that all this was nothing but what was common; tho' I ought to have been as thankful for so strange and unforseen Providence, as if it had been miraculous; for it was really the Work of Providence as to me, that should order or appoint, that 10 or 12 Grains of Corn should remain unspoil'd, (when the Rats had destroy'd all the rest,) as if it had been dropt from Heaven; as also, that I should throw it out in that particular Place, where it being in the Shade of a high Rock, it sprang up immediately; whereas, if I had thrown it anywhere else, at that Time, it had been burnt up and destroy'd. 
<br> 
<br> I carefully sav'd the Ears of this Corn you may be sure in their Season, which was about the End of June; and laying up every Corn, resolv'd to sow them all again, hoping in Time to have some Quantity sufficient to supply me with Bread; But it was not till the 4th Year that I could allow my self the least Grain of this Corn to eat, and even then but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards in its Order; for I lost all that I sow'd the first Season, by not Observing the proper Time; for I sow'd it just before the dry Season, so that it never came up at all, at least, not as it would ha' done: Of which in its Place. 
<br> 
<br> Besides this Barley, there was, as above, 20 or 30 Stalks of Ryce, which I preserv'd with the same Care, and whose Use was of the same Kind or to the same Purpose, (viz.) to make me Bread, or rather Food; for I found Ways to cook it up without baking, tho' I did that also after some Time. But to return to my Journal, 
<br> 
<br> I work'd excessive hard these three or four Months to get my Wall done; and the 14th of April I closed it up, contriving to go into it, not by a Door, but over the Wall by a Ladder, that there might be no Sign in the Out-side of my Habitation. 
<br> 
<br> April 16. I finish'd the Ladder, so I went up with the Ladder to the Top, and then pull'd it up after me, and let it down in the In-side: This was a compleat Enclosure to men for within I had Room enough, and nothing could come at me from without, unless it could first mount my Wall. 
<br> 
<br> The very next Day after this Wall was finish'd, I had almost had all my Labour overthrown at once, and my self kill'd; the Case was thus, As I was busy in the Inside of it, behind my Tent, just in the Entrance into my Cave, I was terribly frighted with a most dreadful surprising Thing indeed; for all on a sudden I found the Earth come crumbling down from the Roof of my Cave, and from the Edge of the Hill over my Head, and two of the Posts I had set up in the Cave crack'd in a frightful Manner; I was heartily scar'd, but thought nothing' of what was really the Cause, only thinking that the Top of my Cave was falling in, as some of it had done before; and for Fear I shou'd be bury'd in it, I run foreward to my Ladder, and not thinking my self safe there neither, I got over my Wall for Fear of the Pieces of the Hill which I expected might roll down upon me: I was no sooner stepp'd down upon the firm Ground, but I plainly saw it was a terrible Earthquake, for the Ground I stood on shook three Times at about eight Minutes Distance, with three such Shocks, as would have overturn'd the strongest Building that could be suppos'd to have stood on the Earth, and a great Piece of the Top of a Rock, which stood about half a Mile from me next the Sea, fell down with such a terrible Noise, as I never heard in all my Life, I perceiv'd also, the very Sea was put into violent Motion by it; and I believe the Shocks were stronger under the Water than on the Island. 
<br> 
<br> I was so amaz'd with the Thing it self, having never felt the like, or discours'd with any one that had, that I was like one dead or stupify'd; and the Motion of the Earth made my Stomach sick like one that was toss'd at Sea; but the Noise of the falling of the Rock awak'd me as it were, and rousing me from the stupify'd Condition I was in, fill'd me with Horror, and I thought of nothing then but the Hill falling upon my Tent and all my houshold Goods, and burying all at once; and this sunk my very Soul within me a second Time. 
<br> 
<br> After the third Shock was over, and I felt no more for some Time, I began to take Courage, and yet I had not Heart enough to go over my Wall again, for Fear of being buried alive, but sat Still upon the Ground, greatly cast down and disconsolate, not knowing what to do: All this while I had not the least Serious religious Thought, nothing but the common, Lord ha' Mercy upon me; and when it was over, that went away too. 
<br> 
<br> While I sat thus, I found the Air over-cast, and grow cloudy, as if it would Rain; soon after that the Wind rose by little and little, so that, in less than half an Hour, it blew a most dreadful Hurricane: The Sea was all on a Sudden cover'd over with Foam and Froth, the Shore was cover'd with the Breach of the Water, the Trees were torn up by the Roots, and a terrible Storm it was; and this held about three Hours, and then began to abate, and in two Hours more it was stark calm, and began to rain very hard. 
<br> 
<br> All this while I sat upon the Ground very much terrify'd and dejected, when on a sudden it came into my thoughts, that these Winds and Rain being the Consequences of the Earthquake, the Earthquake it self was spent and over, and I might venture into my Cave again: With this Thought my Spirits began to revive, and the Rain also helping to persuade me, I went in and sat down in my Tent, but the Rain was so violent, that my Tent was ready to be beaten down with it, and I was forc'd to go into my Cave, tho' very much afraid and uneasy for fear it should fall on my Head. 
<br> 
<br> This violent Rain forc'd me to a new Work, viz. To cut a Hole thro' my new Fortification like a Sink to let the Water go out, which would else have drown'd my Cave. After I had been in my Cave some time, and found still no more Shocks of the Earthquake follow, I began to be more compos'd; and now to support my Spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little Store and took a small Sup of Rum, which however I did then and always very sparingly, knowing I could have no more when that was gone. 
<br> 
<br> It continu'd raining all that Night, and great Part of the next Day, so that I could not stir abroad, but my Mind being more compos'd, I began to think of what I had best do, concluding that if the Island was subject to these Earth-quakes, there would be no living for me in a Cave, but I must consider of building me some little Hut in an open Place which I might surround with a Wall as I had done here, and so make my self secure from wild Beasts or Men; but concluded, if I staid where I was, I should certainly, one time or other, be bury'd alive. 
<br> 
<br> With these Thoughts I resolv'd to remove my Tent from the Place where it stood, which was just under the hanging Precipice of the Hill, and which, if it should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my Tent: And I spent the two next Days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in contriving where and how to remove my Habitation. 
<br> 
<br> The fear of being swallow'd up alive, made me that I never slept in quiet, and yet the Apprehensions of lying broad without any Fence was almost equal to it; but still when I look'd about and saw how every thing was put in order, how pleasantly conceal'd I was, and how safe from Danger, it made me very loath to remove. 
<br> 
<br> In the mean time it occur'd to me that it would require a vast deal of time for me to do this, and that I must be contented to run the Venture where I was, till I had form'd a Camp for my self, and had secur'd it so as to remove to it: So with this Resolution I compos'd my self for a time, and resolv'd that I would go to work with all Speed to build me a Wall with Piles and Cables, &amp;c. in a Circle as before, and set my Tent up in it when it was finish'd, but that I would venture to stay where I was till it was finish'd and fit to remove to. This was the 21st. 
<br> 
<br> April 22. The next Morning I began to consider of Means to put this Resolve in Execution, but I was at a great loss about my Tools; I had three large Axes and abundance of Hatchets, (for we carried the Hatchets for Traffick with the Indians) but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard Wood, they were all full of Notches and dull, and tho' I had a Grindstone, I could not turn it and grind my Tools too, this cost me as much Thought as a Statesman would have bestow'd upon a grand Point of Politicks, or a Judge upon the Life and Death of a Man. At length I contriv'd a Wheel with a String, to turn it with my Foot, that I might have both my Hands at Liberty: Note, I had never seen any such thing in England, or at least not to take Notice how it was done, tho' Since I have observ'd it is very common there; besides that, my Grindstone was very large and heavy. This Machine cost me a full Week's Work to bring it to Perfection. 
<br> 
<br> April 28, 29. These two whole Days I took up in grinding my Tools, my Machine for turning my Grindstone performing very well. 
<br> 
<br> April 30. Having perceiv'd my Bread had been low a great while, now I took a Survey of it, and reduc'd my self to one Bisket-cake a Day, which made my Heart very heavy. 
<br> 
<br> May 1. In the Morning looking towards the Sea-side, the Tide being low, I saw something lye on the Shore bigger than ordinary, and it look'd like a Cask; when I came to it, I found a small Barrel, and two or three Pieces of the Wreck of the Ship, which were driven on Shore by the late Hurricane, and looking towards the Wreck itself, I thought it seem'd to lye higher out of the Water than it us'd to do; I examin'd the Barrel which was driven on Shore, and soon found it was a Barrel of Gunpowder, but it had taken Water, and the Powder was cak'd as hard as a Stone; however I roll'd it farther on Shore for the present, and went on upon the Sands as near as I could to the Wreck of the Ship to look for more. 
<br> 
<br> When I came down to the Ship I found it strangely remov'd, The Fore-castle which lay before bury'd in Sand, was heav'd up at least Six Foot, and the Stern which was broke to Pieces and parted from the rest by the Force of the Sea soon after I had left rummaging her, was toss'd, as it were, up, and cast on one Side, and the Sand was thrown so high on that Side next her Stern, that whereas there was a beat Place of Water before, so that I could not come within a Quarter of a Mile of the Wreck without swimming, I could now walk quite up to her when the Tide was out; I was surpriz'd with this at first, but soon concluded it must be done by the Earthquake, and as by this Violence the Ship was more broken open than formerly, so many Things came daily on Shore, which the Sea had loosen'd, and which the Winds and Water rolled by Degrees to the Land. 
<br> 
<br> This wholly diverted my Thoughts from the Design of removing my Habitation; and I busied my self mightily that Day especially, in searching whether I could make any Way into the Ship, but I found nothing was to be expected of that Kind, for that all the In-side of the Ship was choack'd up with Sand: However, as I had learn'd not to despair of any Thing, I resolv'd to pull every Thing to Pieces that I could of the Ship, concluding, that every Thing I could get from her would be of some Use or other to me. 
<br> 
<br> May 3. I began with my Saw, and cut a Piece of a Beam thro', which I thought held some of the upper Part or Quarter-Deck together, and when I had cut it thro', I clear'd away the Sand as well as I could from the Side which lay highest; but the Tide coming' in, I was oblig'd to give over for that Time. 
<br> 
<br> May 4. I went a fishing, but caught not ; and having no Victuals to eat, took my Gun, but found my self very weak; however I kill'd a She-Goat, and with much Difficulty got it Home, and broil'd some of it, and eat; I wou'd fain have stew'd it, and made some Broath, but had no Pot. 
<br> 
<br> June 27. The Ague again so violent, that I lay a-Bed all Day, and neither eat or drank. I was ready to perish for Thirst, but so weak, I had not Strength to stand up, or to get my self any Water to drink: Pray'd to God again, but was light-headed, and when I was not, I was so ignorant, that I knew not what to say; only I lay and cry'd, Lord look upon me, Lord pity me, Lord have Mercy upon me: I suppose I did nothing else for two or three Hours, till the Fit wearing off, I fell asleep, and did not wake till far in the Night; when I wak'd, I found my self much refresh'd, but weak, and exceeding thirsty: However, as I had no Water bin my whole Habitation, I was forc'd to lie t?’?dàinto it, but almost full of Water and Sand. 
<br> 
<br> May 8. Went to the Wreck, and carry'd an Iron Crow to wrench up the Deck, which lay now quite clear of the Water or Sand; I wrench'd open two Planks, and brought them on Shore also with the Tide: I left the Iron Crow in the Wreck for next Day. 
<br> 
<br> May 9. Went to the Wreck, and with the Crow made Way into the Body of the Wreck, and felt several Casks, and loosen'd them with the Crow, but could not break them up; I felt also the Roll of English Lead, and could stir it, but it was too heavy to remove. 
<br> 
<br> May 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Went every Day to the Wreck, and got a great deal of Pieces of Timber, and Boards, or Plank, and 2 or 300 Weight of Iron. 
<br> 
<br> May 15. I carry'd two Hatchets to try if I could not cut a Piece off of the Roll of Lead, by placing the Edge of one Hatchet, and driving it with the other; but as it lay about a Foot and a half in the Water, I could not make any Blow to drive the Hatchet. 
<br> 
<br> May 16. It had blow'd hard in the Night, and the Wreck appear'd more broken by the Force of the Water; but I stay'd so long in the Woods to get Pidgeons for Food, that the Tide prevented me going to the Wreck that Day. 
<br> 
<br> May 17. I saw some Pieces of the Wreck blown on Shore, at a great Distance, near two Miles off me, but resolv'd to see what they were, and found it was a Piece of the Head, but too heavy for me to bring away. 
<br> 
<br> May 24. Every Day to this Day I work'd on the Wreck, and with hard Labour I loosen'd some Things so much with the Crow, that the first blowing Tide several Casks floated out, and two of the Seamens Chests; but the Wind blowing from the Shore, nothing came to Land that Day, but Pieces of Timber, and a Hogshead which had some Brazil Pork in it, but the Salt-water and the Sand had spoil'd it. 
<br> 
<br> I continu'd this Work every Day to the 15th of June, except the Time necessary to get Food, which I always appointed, during this Part of my Employment, to be when the Tide was up, that I might be ready when it was ebb'd out, and by this Time I had gotten Timber, and Plank, and Iron-Work enough, to have builded a good Boat, if I had known how; and also, I got at several Times, and in several Pieces, near 100 Weight of the Sheet-Lead. 
<br> 
<br> June 16. Going down to the Sea-side, I found a large Tortoise or Turtle; this was the first I had seen, which it seems was only my Misfortune, not any Defect of the Place, or Scarcity; for had I happen'd to be on the other Side of the Island, I might have had Hundreds of them every Day, as I found afterwards; but perhaps had paid dear enough for them. 
<br> 
<br> June 17. I spent in cooking the Turtle; I found in her threescore Eggs; and her Flesh was to me at that Time the most savoury and pleasant that ever I tasted in my Life, having had no Flesh, but of Goats and Fowls, since I landed in this horrid Place. 
<br> 
<br> June 18. Rain'd all Day, and I stay'd within. I thought at this Time the Rain felt Cold, and I was something chilly, which I knew was not usual in that Latitude. 
<br> 
<br> June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the Weather had been cold. 
<br> 
<br> June 20. No Rest all Night, violent Pains in my Head, and feaverish. 
<br> 
<br> June 21. Very ill, frighted almost to Death with the Apprehensions of my sad Condition, to be sick, and no Help: Pray'd to GOD for the first Time since the Storm off of Hull, but scarce knew what I said, or why; my Thoughts being all confused. 
<br> 
<br> June 22. A little better, but under dreadful Apprehensions of Sickness. 
<br> 
<br> June 23. Very bad again, cold and shivering, and then a violent Head-ach. 
<br> 
<br> June 24. Much better. 
<br> 
<br> June 25. An Ague very violent; the Fit held me seven Hours, cold Fit and hot, with faint Sweats after it. 
<br> 
<br> June 26. Better; and having no Victuals to eat, took my Gun, but found my self very weak; however I kill'd a She-Goat, and with much Difficulty got it Home, and broil'd some of it, and eat; I wou'd fain have stew'd it, and made some Broath, but had no Pot. 
<br> 
<br> June 27. The Ague again so violent, that I lay a-Bed all Day, and neither eat or drank. I was ready to perish for Thirst, but so weak, I had not Strength to stand up, or to get my self any Water to drink: Pray'd to God again, but was light-headed, and when I was not, I was so ignorant, that I knew not what to say; only I lay and cry'd, Lord look upon me, Lord pity me, Lord have Mercy upon me: I suppose I did nothing else for two or three Hours, till the Fit wearing off, I fell asleep, and did not wake till far in the Night; when I wak'd, I found my self much refresh'd, but weak, and exceeding thirsty: However, as I had no Water bin my whole Habitation, I was forc'd to lie till Morning, and went to sleep again: In this second Sleep, I had this terrible Dream. 
<br> 
<br> I thought, that I was sitting on the Ground on the Outside of my Wall, where I sat when the Storm blew after the Earthquake, and that I saw a Man descend from a great black Cloud, in a bright Flame of Fire, and light upon the Ground: He was all over as bright as a Flame, so that I could but just bear to look towards him; his Countenance was most inexpressibly dreadful, impossible for Words to describe; when he stepp'd upon the Ground with his Feet, I thought the Earth trembl'd, just as it had done before in the Earthquake, and all the Air look'd, to my Apprehension, as if it had been fill'd with Flashes of Fire. 
<br> 
<br> He was no sooner landed upon the Earth, but he moved forward towards me, with a long Spear or Weapon in his Hand, to kill me; and when he came to a rising Ground, at some Distance, he spoke to me, or I heard a Voice so terrible, that it is impossible to express the Terror of it; all that I can say, I understood, was this, Seeing all these Things have not brought thee to Repentance, nom thou shalt die: At which Words, I thought he lifted up the Spear that was in his Hand, to kill me. 
<br> 
<br> No one, that shall ever read this Account, will expect that I should be able to describe the Horrors of my Soul at this terrible Vision, I mean, that even while it was a Dream, I even dreamed of those Horrors; nor is it any more possible to describe the Impression that remain'd upon my Mind when I awak'd and found it was but a Dream. 
<br> 
<br> I had alas! no divine Knowledge; what I had received by the good Instruction of my Father was then worn out by an uninterrupted Series, for 8 Years, of Seafaring Wickedness, and a constant Conversation with nothing but such as were like my self, wicked and prophane to the last Degree: I do not remember that I had in all that Time one Thought that so much as tended either to looking upwards toward God, or inwards towards a Reflection upon my own Ways: But a certain Stupidity of Soul, without Desire of Good, or Conscience of Evil, had entirely overwhelm'd me, and I was all that the most hardened, unthinking, wicked Creature among our common Sailors, can be supposed to be, not having the least Sense, either of the Fear of God in Danger, or of Thankfulness to God in Deliverances. 
<br> 
<br> In the relating what is already past of my Story, this will be the more easily believ'd, when I shall add, that thro' all the Variety of Miseries that had to this Day befallen me, I never had so much as one Thought of it being the Hand of God, or that it was a just Punishment for my Sin; my rebellious Behaviour against my Father, or my present Sins which were great; or so much as a Punishment for the general Course of my wicked Life. When I was on the desperate Expedition on the desert Shores of Africa, I never had so as one Thought of what would become of me; or one to od to direct me whether I should go, or to keep me from the Danger which apparently surrounded me, as well from voracious Creatures as cruel Savages: But I was meerly thoughtless of a God, or a Providence; acted like a meer Brute from the Principles of Nature, and by the Dictates of common Sense only, and indeed hardly that.

<br> 日记 
<br> 
<br> 一六五九年九月三十日我，可怜而不幸的鲁宾逊·克罗索，在一场可怕的大风暴中，在大海中沉船遇难，流落到这个荒凉的孤岛上。我且把此岛称之为"绝望岛"吧。同船伙伴皆葬身鱼腹，我本人却九死一生。
<br> 
<br> 整整一天，我为自己凄凉的境遇悲痛欲绝。我没有食物，没有房屋，没有衣服，没有武器，也没有地方可逃，没有获救的希望，只有死路一条，不是被野兽吞嚼，被野人饱腹，就是因缺少食物而活活饿死。夜幕降临，因怕被野兽吃掉，我睡在一棵树上。虽然整夜下雨，我却睡得很香。
<br> 
<br> 十月一日清晨醒来，只见那只大船随涨潮已浮起，并冲到了离岸很近的地方。这大大出于我意料。使我感到快慰的是，大船依然直挺挺地停在那儿，没有被海浪打得粉碎。我想，待风停浪息之后，可以上去弄些食物和日用品来救急。但又想到那些失散了的伙伴，这使我倍感悲伤。我想，要是我们当时都留在大船上，也许能保住大船，至少也不至于被淹死。假如伙伴们不死，我们可以用大船残余部分的木料，造一条小船，我们可乘上小船划到别处去。这一天，大部分的时间我为这些念头所困扰。后来，看到船里没进多少水，我便走到离船最近的沙滩，泅水上了船。这一天雨还是下个不停，但没有一点风。
<br> 
<br> 从十月一日至二十四日，我连日上船，把我所能搬动的东西通通搬了下来，趁涨潮时用木排运上岸。这几天雨水很多，有时也时停时续。看来，这儿当前正是雨季。
<br> 
<br> 十月二十日木排翻倒，上面的货物也都翻到水里去了，但木排翻倒的地方水很浅，那些东西又都很重，所以没有被冲走。一等退潮，我还是捞回了不少东西。
<br> 
<br> 十月二十五日雨下了一天一夜，还夹着阵阵大风。风越刮越凶，最后竟把大船打得粉碎。退潮时可以看到大船的碎片，但大船已不复存在。这一整天，我把从船上搬回来的东西安置好并覆盖起来，以免给雨水淋坏。
<br> 
<br> 十月二十六日我在岸上跑了差不多一整天，想寻找一个合适的地方做住所，我最担心的是安全问题，住地必须能防御野兽或野人在夜间对我进行突然袭击。傍晚，我终于在一个山岩下找到了合适的地方。我划了一个半圆形作为构筑住所的地点，并决定沿着那个半圆形安上两层木桩，中间盘上缆索，外面再加上草皮，筑成一个坚固的防御工事，像围墙或堡垒之类的建筑物。
<br> 
<br> 二十六日至三十日我埋头苦干，把全部货物搬到新的住地，虽然有时大雨倾盆。
<br> 
<br> 三十一日早晨我带枪深入孤岛腹地，一则为了找点吃的，一则为了查看一下小岛环境。我打死了一只母山羊，她的一只小羊跟着我回家，后来我把它也杀了，因为它不肯吃食。
<br> 
<br> 十一月一日我在小山下搭起了一个帐篷，我尽可能把帐篷搭大些，里面再打上几根木桩用来挂吊床，我第一夜在帐篷里睡觉。
<br> 
<br> 十一月二日我把所有的箱子、木板，以及做木排用的木料，沿着半圆形内侧堆成一个临时性的围墙，作为我的防御工事。
<br> 
<br> 十一月三日我带枪外出，打死两只野鸭似的飞禽，肉很好吃，下午开始做桌子。
<br> 
<br> 十一月四日早晨，开始计划时间的安排。规定了工作的时间，带枪外出的时间，睡眠的时间以及消遣的时间。我的计划是这样的：每天早晨，如果不下雨，就带枪出去跑上二三小时，回来后再工作到十一点左右；然后，就有什么吃什么；十二点至二点为午睡时间，因为这儿天炎热异常；傍晚再开始工作。今天和明天的全部工作时间，我都用来做桌子。目前我还是个拙劣的工匠，做一样东西要化很多时间。但不久我就成了一个熟练工了。什么事做多了就熟能生巧，另一方面也是迫于需要。我相信，这在其他任何人也是办得到的。
<br> 
<br> 十一月五日今天我带枪外出，并且把狗也带上了。打死了一只野猫，其毛皮柔软，但肉却不能吃。我每打死什么动物，都剥下毛皮保存起来。从海边回来时，看到各种不同的水鸟，我都叫不上名字。还看到两三只海豹，使我大吃一惊。我开始看到它们时，一时还不知道究竟是什么动物。后来它们游向了大海。这一次，它们从我眼皮底下逃掉了。
<br> 
<br> 十一月六日早晨外出回来后就继续做桌子，最后终于完成了，但样子很难看，我自己都不满意。不久，我又设法把桌子改进了一下。
<br> 
<br> 十一月七日天气开始晴朗起来。七日，八日，九日，十日以及十二日的一部分时间（十一日是礼拜日），我都用来做一把椅子，费了好大的劲，才勉强做成椅子的样子，连差强人意都谈不上。在做的过程中，我做了再拆，拆了再做，折腾了好几次。
<br> 
<br> 附记：我不久就不再做礼拜了。因为我忘记在木桩上刻凹痕了，因而也就记不起哪天是哪天了。
<br> 
<br> 十一月十三日今天下雨，令人精神为之一爽。天气也凉快多了，但大雨伴随着闪电雷鸣，吓得我半死，万分惊恐，因为我担心火药会被雷电击中而炸毁。因此，雷雨一停，我就着手把火药分成许许多多小包，以免不测。
<br> 
<br> 十一月十四日，十五日，十六日。这三天，我做了许多小方匣，每个匣子大约可以装一两磅火药。我把火药装入匣内，并分开小心安全地贮藏好。其中有一天，我打到了一只大鸟，肉很好吃，但我不知道是什么鸟。
<br> 
<br> 十一月十七日今天开始，我在帐篷后的岩壁上开始挖洞，以扩大我住所的空间，使生活更方便些。
<br> 
<br> 附记：要挖洞，我最需要的是三样工具：一把鹤嘴锄，一把铲子和一辆手推车或一只箩筐。我就先不挖洞，而是考虑制造一些必不可少的工具。我用起货钩代替鹤嘴锄，还凑合用，只是重了点。此外，还需要一把铲子，这是挖土的重要工具，没有铲子，什么事也别想做，可我不知道怎样才能做把铲子。
<br> 
<br> 十一月十八日第二天，我去树林里搜寻，发现一种树，像巴西的"铁树"，因为这种树的木质特别坚硬。我费了好大的劲才砍下了一块，几乎把我的斧头都砍坏了。又费了不少力气，才把木块带回住所，因为这种木头实在太重了。
<br> 
<br> 这种木料确实非常坚硬，可是我别无他法，所以，我化了好大的功夫才做成一把铲子。我慢慢把木块削成铲子的形状，铲柄完全像英国铲子一样，只是铲头没有包上铁，所以没有正式的铁铲那么耐用。不过，必要时用一下也还能勉强对付。我想，世界上没有一把铲子是做成这个样子的，也决不会化这么长的时间才做成一把铲子。
<br> 
<br> 虽然有了鹤嘴锄和铲子，但工具还是不够，我还缺少一只箩筐或一辆手推车。箩筐我没有办法做，因为我没有像编藤皮用的细软的枝条，至少现在我还没有找到。至于手推车，我想除了轮子外，其他都可以做出来。可做轮子却不那么容易，我简直不知从何处着手。此外，我也无法做一个铁的轮子轴心，使轮子能转动。因此，我决定放弃做轮子的念头，而做一个灰斗似的东西--就是小工替泥水匠运泥灰用的灰斗，这样就可把石洞里挖出来的泥土运出来。
<br> 
<br> 这工作不像做铲子那么难。但制造这些工具--灰斗和铲子，以及试图做手推车最终又不得不放弃，一共化费了整整四天时间，当然不包括每天早晨带枪外出的时间。可以说，我几乎没有一天不出去，也几乎没有一天不带回些猎物作吃食。
<br> 
<br> 十一月二十三日因为做工具，其他工作都搁了下来，等这些工具制成，我又继续做所耽搁了的工作。只要有精力和时间，我每天都工作，化了整整十八天的功夫扩大和加深了岩洞；洞室一拓宽，存放东西就更方便了。
<br> 
<br> 附记：这几天，我的工作主要是扩大洞室。这样，这个山洞成了我的贮藏室和军火库，也是我的厨房、餐室和地窖。
<br> 
<br> 我一般仍睡在帐篷里，除非在雨季，雨下得太大，帐篷漏雨，我才睡到洞室里。所以，我后来把围墙里的所有地方，通通用长木条搭成屋椽的样子，架在岩石上，再在上面铺些草和大树叶，做成一个茅屋的样子。
<br> 
<br> 十二月十日我本以为挖洞的工程已大功告成，可突然发生了塌方。也许我把洞挖得太大了，大量的泥土从顶上和一旁的岩壁上塌下来，落下的泥土之多，简直把我吓坏了。我这般惊恐，当然不是没有理由的。要是塌方时我正在洞内，那我肯定用不着掘墓人了。这次灾祸一发生，我又有许多工作要做了。我不但要把落下来的松土运出去，还安装了天花板，下面用柱子支撑起来，免得再出现塌方的灾难。
<br> 
<br> 十二月十一日今天我按昨天的计划动手工作，用两根柱子作为支撑，每根柱子上交叉搭上两块木板撑住洞顶。这项工作第二天就完成了。接着我支起了更多的柱子和木板，花了大约一星期的时间把洞顶加固。洞内一行行直立的柱子，把洞室隔成了好几间。
<br> 
<br> 十二月十七日今天至二十日，我在洞里装了许多木架，又在柱子上敲了许多钉子，把那些可以挂起来的东西都挂起来。现在，我的住所看上去有点秩序了。
<br> 
<br> 十二月二十日我把所有的东西都搬进洞里，并开始布置自己的住所。我用木板搭了个碗架似的架子，好摆吃的东西。但木板已经越来越少了。另外，我又做了一张桌子。
<br> 
<br> 十二月二十四日整夜整日大雨倾盆，没有出门。
<br> 
<br> 十二月二十五日整日下雨。
<br> 
<br> 十二月二十六日无雨，天气凉爽多了，人也感到爽快多了。
<br> 
<br> 十二月二十七日打死了一只小山羊，又把另一只小山羊的一条腿打瘸了。我抓住了瘸腿的小山羊，用绳子牵回家。
<br> 
<br> 到家后我把山羊的断腿绑了起来，还上了夹板。
<br> 
<br> 附记：在我精心照料下，受伤的小山羊活下来了，腿也长好了，而且长得很结实。由于我长期抚养，小山羊渐渐驯服起来，整日在我住所门前的草地上吃草，不肯离开。这诱发了我一个念头：我可以饲养一些易于驯服的动物，将来一旦弹药用完也不愁没有东西吃。
<br> 
<br> 十二月二十八日，二十九，三十日酷热无风。整天在家，到傍晚才外出寻食。整日在家里整理东西。
<br> 
<br> 一月一日天气仍然很热。我早晚带枪各外出一次，中午午睡。傍晚我深入孤岛中心的山谷里，发现许多野山羊，但极易受惊，难以捕捉。我决定带狗来试试是否能猎取几只。
<br> 
<br> 一月二日照着昨天的想法，我今天带狗外出，叫它去追捕那些山羊；可是，我想错了，山羊不仅不逃，反而一起面对我的狗奋起反抗。狗也知道危险，不敢接近群羊。
<br> 
<br> 一月三日我动手修筑篱笆或围墙，因为我一直担心受到攻击。我要把围墙筑得又厚又坚固。
<br> 
<br> 附记：关于围墙，我前面已交待过了，在日记中，就不再重复已经说过的话了。这里只提一下：从一月三日至四月十四日，我一直在修筑这座围墙。最后终于完成了，并尽可能做得完满。围墙呈半圆形，从岩壁的一边，围向另一边，两处相距约八码，围墙全长仅二十四码，岩洞的门正好处于围墙中部后面。
<br> 
<br> 在这段时间里，我努力工作，尽管雨水耽搁了我许多天，甚至好几个星期。我觉得，围墙不做好，我住在里面就没有安全感。我做的每件工作所花的劳动，简直难以令人置信。尤其是那些木桩，要把木桩从树林里搬回来，又要打进土里，实在非常吃力，因为我把木桩做得太大了，而实际上并不需要那么大。
<br> 
<br> 墙筑好后，又在墙外堆了一层草皮泥，堆得和墙一般高。
<br> 
<br> 这样，我想，即使有人到岛上来，也不一定看得出里面有人祝我的这一做法是非常明智的。后来事实证明了这一点。
<br> 
<br> 在此期间，只要雨不大，我总要到树林里去寻找野味，并常有一些新的发现，可以改善我的生活。尤其是我发现了一种野鸽，它们不像斑尾林鸽那样在树上作窠，而像家鸽一样在石穴里作窝。我抓了几只小鸽子，想把它们驯养大。养倒是养大了，可一大就飞走了。想来也许我没有经常给它们喂食；事实上，我也没什么东西可喂它们。然而，我经常找到它们的窝，就捉些小鸽子回来，这种鸽子的肉非常好吃。
<br> 
<br> 在料理家务的过程中，我发现还缺少许多许多东西；有些东西根本没办法制造，事实也确实如此。壁如，我无法制造木桶，因为根本无法把桶箍起来。前面我曾提到，我有一两只小桶；可是，我花了好几个星期的功夫还是做不出一只新桶来。我无法把桶底安上去，也无法把那些薄板拼合得不漏水。最后，我只好放弃了做桶的念头。
<br> 
<br> 其次，我无法制造蜡烛，所以一到天黑就只得上床睡觉。
<br> 
<br> 在这儿一般七点左右天就黑下来了。我记得我曾有过一大块蜜蜡，那是我从萨累的海盗船长手里逃到非洲沿岸的航程中做蜡烛用的，现在早已没有了。我唯一的补救办法是：每当我杀山羊时，把羊油留下来。我用泥土做成一个小盘子，经太阳暴晒成了一个小泥盘，然后把羊油放在泥盘里，再弄松麻绳后取下一些麻絮做灯心。这样总算做成了一盏灯，虽然光线没有蜡烛明亮和稳定，但也至少给了我一点光明。
<br> 
<br> 在我做这些事的时候，我偶尔翻到了一个小布袋。我上面已提到过，这布袋里装了一些谷类，是用来喂家禽的，而不是为这次航行供船员食用的。这袋谷子可能是上次从里斯本出发时带上船的吧。袋里剩下的一点谷类早已被老鼠吃光了，只留下一些尘土和谷壳。因为我很需要这个布袋，就把袋里的尘土和谷壳抖在岩石下的围墙边。当时，想必是我要用这布袋来装火药吧，因为，我记得我给闪电雷鸣吓坏了，急于要把火药分开包装好。
<br> 
<br> 我扔掉这些东西，正是上面提到的那场大雨之前不久的事。扔掉后也就完了，再也没有想起这件事情。大约一个月之后，我发现地上长出了绿色的茎干。起初我以为那只是自己以前没有注意到的某种植物罢了。但不久以后，我看到长出了十一二个穗头，与欧洲的大麦，甚至与英国的大麦一模一样，这使我十分惊讶。
<br> 
<br> 我又惊愕，又困惑，心里的混乱难以用笔墨形容。我这个人不信教，从不以宗教诫律约束自己的行为，认为一切出于偶然，或简单地归之于天意，从不去追问造物主的意愿及其支配世间万物的原则。但当我看到，尽管这儿气候不宜种谷类，却长出了大麦；何况我对这些大麦是怎么长出来的一无所知，自然吃惊不校于是我想到，这只能是上帝显示的奇迹--没有人播种，居然能长出庄稼来。我还想到，这是上帝为了能让我在这荒无人烟的孤岛上活下去才这么做的。
<br> 
<br> 想到这里，我颇为动情，禁不住流下了眼泪。我开始为自己的命运庆幸，这种世间少有的奇事，竟会在我身上发生。
<br> 
<br> 尤其令我感到不可思议的是，在大麦茎干的旁边，沿着岩壁，稀稀落落长出了几枝其他绿色的茎干，显然是稻茎；我认得出那是稻子，因为我在非洲上岸时曾见过这种庄稼。
<br> 
<br> 当时，我不仅认为这些谷类都是老天为了让我活命而赐给我的，并且还相信岛上其他地方一定还有。于是，我在岛上搜遍了我曾经到过的地方，每个角落，每块岩石边我都查看了一遍，想找到麦穗和稻秆，可是，再也找不到了。最后，我终于想起，我曾经有一只放鸡饲料的袋子，我把里面剩下的谷壳抖到了岩壁下。这一想，我惊异的心情一扫而光。老实说，我认为这一切都是极其平常的事，所以我对上帝的感恩之情也随之减退了。然而，对发生这样的奇迹，对意料之外的天意，我还是应该感恩戴德的。老鼠吃掉了绝大部分谷粒，而仅存的十几颗竟然没有坏掉，仿佛从天上掉下来似的，发生这样的奇迹难道不是天意又是什么呢？再说，我把这十几颗谷粒不扔在其他地方，恰恰扔在岩壁下，因而遮住了太阳，使其很快长了出来；如果丢在别处，肯定早就给太阳晒死了，这难道不是天意吗？
<br> 
<br> 到了大麦成熟的季节，大约是六月底，我小心地把麦穗收藏起来，一颗麦粒也舍不得丢失。我要用这些收获的麦粒作种子重新播种一次，希望将来收获多了，可以用来做面包吃。后来，一直到第四年，我才吃到一点点自己种的粮食，而且也只能吃得非常节剩这些都是后事，我以后自会交待。第一次播种，由于季节不对头，我把全部种子都损失了。因为我正好在旱季来临前播下去，结果种子根本发不了芽，即使长出来了，也长不好。这些都是后话。
<br> 
<br> 除了大麦，另外还有二三十枝稻秆，我同样小心翼翼地把稻谷收藏起来，目的也是为了能再次播种，好自己做面包吃，或干脆煮来吃，因为后来我发现不必老是用烘烤的办法，放在水里煮一下也能吃，当然后来我也烤着吃。现在，再回到我的日记上来吧。
<br> 
<br> 这三四个月，我工作非常努力，修筑好了围墙。到四月十四日，完成了封闭围墙的工作，因为我原来就计划不用门进出，而是用一架梯子越墙而过。这样外来的人就看不出里面是住人的地方。
<br> 
<br> 四月十六日我做好了梯子。我用梯子爬上墙头，再收起来放到围墙的内侧爬下去。围墙是全封闭的；墙内我有足够的活动空间，墙外的人则无法进入墙内，除非也越墙而入。
<br> 
<br> 完成围墙后的第二天，我几乎一下子前功尽弃，而且差点送命。事情是这样的：正当我在帐篷后面的山洞口忙着干活时，突然发生了一件可怕的事情，把我吓得魂不附体。山洞顶上突然倒塌下大量的泥土和石块，从岩壁上也有泥土和石头滚下来，把我竖在洞里的两根柱子一下子都压断了，发出了可怕的爆裂声，我惊慌失措，全不知道究竟发生了什么事，以为只不过像上回那样发生了塌方，洞顶有一部分塌了下来。我怕被土石埋在底下，立即跑向梯子。后来觉得在墙内还不安全，怕山上滚下来的石块打着我，我爬到了围墙外面。等到我下了梯子站到平地上，我才明白发生了可怕的地震。我所站的地方在八分钟内连续摇动了三次。这三次震动，其强烈程度，足以把地面上最坚固的建筑物震倒。离我大约半英里之外靠近海边的一座小山的岩顶，被震得崩裂下来，那山崩地裂的巨响，把我吓得半死，我平生从未听到过这么可怕的声响。这时，大海汹涌震荡，我想海底下一定比岛上震动得更激烈。
<br> 
<br> 我以前从未碰到过地震，也没有听到经历过地震的人谈起过，所以我一时吓得目瞪口呆，魂飞魄散。当时，地动山摇，胃里直想吐，就像晕船一样；而那山石崩裂发出震耳欲聋的巨响，把我从呆若木鸡的状态中惊醒过来，我感到胆战心惊。小山若倒下来，压在帐篷上和全部家用物品上，一下子就会把一切都埋起来。一想到这里，我心里就凉了半截。
<br> 
<br> 第三次震动过后，过了好久，大地不再晃动了，我胆子才渐渐大起来。但我还是不敢爬进墙去，生怕被活埋。我只是呆呆地坐在地上，垂头丧气，闷闷不乐，不知如何才好。在惊恐中，我从未认真地想到上帝，只是像一般人那样有口无心地叫着"上帝啊，发发慈悲吧！"地震一过，连这种叫唤声也没有了。
<br> 
<br> 我正这么呆坐在地上时，忽见阴云四布，好像马上要下雨了。不久，风势渐平，不到半小时，就刮起了可怕的飓风。
<br> 
<br> 顷刻之间，海面上波涛汹涌，惊涛拍岸，浪花四溅，陆地上大树连根拔起。真是一场可怕的大风暴。风暴刮了大约三小时，就开始减退了；又过了两小时，风静了，却下起了滂沱大雨。
<br> 
<br> 在此期间，我一直呆坐在地上，心中既惊恐又苦闷。后来，我突然想到，这场暴风雨是地震之后发生的。看来地震已经过去，我可以冒险回到我的洞室里去了。这样一想，精神再次振作起来，加上大雨也逼得我走投无路，只好爬过围墙，坐到帐篷里去。但大雨倾盆而下，几乎要把帐篷都压塌，我就只好躲到山洞里去，心里却始终惶恐不安，唯恐山顶塌下来把我压死。
<br> 
<br> 这场暴雨逼使我去做一件新的工作。这就是在围墙脚下开一个洞，像一条排水沟，这样就可把水放出去，以免把山洞淹没。在山洞里坐了一会儿，地震再也没有发生，我才稍稍镇静下来。这时我感到十分需要壮壮胆，就走到贮藏室里，倒了一小杯甘蔗酒喝。我喝甘蔗酒一向很节省，因为我知道，喝完后就没有了。
<br> 
<br> 大雨下了整整一夜，第二天又下了大半天，因此我整天不能出门。现在，我心里平静多了，就考虑起今后的生活。我的结论是，既然岛上经常会发生地震，我就不能老住在山洞里。我得考虑在开阔的平地上造一间小茅屋，四面像这里一样围上一道墙，以防野兽或野人的袭击。如果我在这里住下去，迟早会被活埋的。
<br> 
<br> 想到这里，我决定要把帐篷从原来的地方搬开。现在的帐篷正好搭在小山的悬崖下面。如果再发生地震，那悬崖塌下来必定砸倒帐篷。于是我花了两天的时间，即四月十九日和二十日，来计划新的住址以及搬家的方法。
<br> 
<br> 我唯恐被活埋，整夜不得安睡。但想到睡在外面，四周毫无遮挡，心里又同样害怕。而当我环顾四周，看到一切应用物品都安置得井井有条，自己的住地又隐蔽又安全，又极不愿意搬家了。
<br> 
<br> 同时，我也想到，建个新家耗费时日，目前还不得不冒险住在这里。以后，等我建造好一个新的营地，并也像这儿一样保护起来，才能再搬过去。这样决定之后，我心里安定多了，并决定以最快的速度，用木桩和缆索之类的材料照这儿的样子筑一道围墙，再把帐篷搭在围墙里。但在新的营地建造好之前，我还得冒险住在原地。这是四月二十一日的事。
<br> 
<br> 四月二十二日，今天早上，我开始考虑实施我搬家的计划，但却无法解决工具问题。我有三把大斧和许多小斧（我们带了许多小斧，是准备与非洲土人做交易用的），但由于经常用来砍削多节的硬木头，弄得都是缺口，一点也不快了。磨刀砂轮倒是有一个，但我却无法转动磨轮来磨工具。为了设法使磨轮转动，我煞费苦心，犹如政治家思考国家大事，也像法官决定一个人的生死命运。最后，我想出办法，用一根绳子套在一个轮子上，用脚转动轮子，两手就可腾出来磨工具了。
<br> 
<br> 附记：在英国，我从未见过磨刀的工具，即使见过，自己也没注意过这种东西的样子，尽管在英国这种磨刀工具是到处可见的。此外，我的磨轮又大又笨重。我花了整整一个星期，才把这个磨刀机器做好。
<br> 
<br> 四月二十八日、二十九日整整两天，我忙着磨工具。转动磨轮的机器效果不错。
<br> 
<br> 四月三十日我发现食物大大减少了，就仔细检查了一下，决定减为每天只吃一块饼干，这使我心里非常忧虑。
<br> 
<br> 五月一日早晨，我向海面望去，只见潮水已经退了。一个看上去像桶一样的大东西搁浅在岸边。我走过去一看，原来是一只小木桶，另外还有几艘破船的残骸；这些都是被飓风刮到岸上来的。再看看那只破船，只见比先前更高出水面。
<br> 
<br> 我察看了一下冲上岸边的木桶，发现原来是一桶火药，但火药已浸水，结得像石头一样硬。不过，我还是暂时把它滚到岸上。然后踏上沙滩，尽量走近那破船，希望能再弄到点什么东西。
<br> 
<br> 我走近船边，发现船的位置已大大变动了。在此之前，船头是埋在沙里的；现在，至少抬高了六英尺。至于那船尾，在我最后一次上船搜括东西之后不久，就被海浪打得粉碎，脱离了船身；现在，看样子被海水冲到一边去了。在船尾旁，原来是一大片水洼子，约四分之一海里宽；要接近破船，非得游泳不可。而现在，水洼被沙泥壅塞，堆得高高的。所以，一退潮，就可以直接走到船跟前。我起初对这一变化感到有点意外，但不久就马上明白，这是地震的结果。由于地震的激烈震动，船破得更不像样了。每天，总有些东西被海浪从船上打下来，风力和潮水又把这些东西冲到岸上。
<br> 
<br> 这使我把搬家的计划暂时搁置一边。当天，我便想方设法要到船上去。但我发现，船上已没有什么东西可拿了，因为船里都被沙泥堆塞。可是我现在对什么事都不轻易放弃，所以决定把船上能拆下来的东西通通拆下来。我相信，这些东西将来对我总会有些用处的。
<br> 
<br> 五月三日我动手用锯子锯断了一根船梁。我猜想，这根船梁是支撑上面的甲板或后面的甲板的。船梁锯断后，我尽力清除旁边积得很高的泥沙。但不久潮水开始上涨，我不得不暂时放弃这一工作。
<br> 
<br> 五月四日今天去钓鱼，但钓到的鱼没有一条我敢吃的。
<br> 
<br> 我感到不耐烦了，正想离开时，却钓到了一只小海豚。我用绞绳的麻丝做了一根长长的钓鱼线，但我没有鱼钩。不过我还是常能钓到鱼吃。我把钓到的鱼都晒干了再吃。
<br> 
<br> 五月五日在破船上干活。又锯断了一根船梁。从甲板上取下三块松木板，把板捆在一起，趁涨潮时把它们飘到岸上。
<br> 
<br> 五月六日继续上破船干活。从船上取下几根铁条和一些铁器。工作得很辛苦，回来时累坏了，很想放弃这种工作。
<br> 
<br> 五月七日又到破船上去，但不想再干活了。由于船梁已锯断，破船已承受不住自己的重量，因此自己碎裂了。有几块木板散落下来，船舱裂开，看进去里面尽是水和泥沙。
<br> 
<br> 五月八日到破船上去。这次我带了一只起货用的铁钩，撬开了甲板，因为甲板上已没有多少水和沙泥了。我撬下了两块木板，像前次那样趁着潮水送上岸。我把起货铁钩留在船上，以便明天再用。
<br> 
<br> 五月九日到破船上去，用铁钩撬入船身，探到了几只木桶。我用铁钩把这几只桶撬松了，却无法把桶打开。我也探到了那卷英国铅皮，并已拨动了，但实在太重了，根本搬不动。
<br> 
<br> 五月十日、十一日、十二日、十三日、十四日每天上破船，弄到了不少木料和木板，以及二三百磅的铁。
<br> 
<br> 五月十五日我带了两把小斧上船，想用一把小斧的斧口放在那卷铅皮上，再用另一把去敲，试试能不能截一块铅皮下来。但因为铅皮在水下有一英尺半深，根本无法敲到放在铅皮上的手斧。
<br> 
<br> 五月十六日刮了一夜大风，风吹浪打后，那条失事的船显得更破烂不堪了。我在树林里找鸽子吃，耽误了不少时间；等我想上船时，潮水已涨了上来，就无法再到船上去了。
<br> 
<br> 五月十七日我看见几块沉船的残骸飘到岸上，离我差不多有两英里远，决心走过去看个究竟。原来是船头上的一块木料，但太重了，根本搬不动。
<br> 
<br> 五月二十四日几天来，我每天上破船干活。我费尽力气，用起货铁钩撬松了一些东西。潮水一来，竟有几只木桶和两只水手箱子浮了出来。由于风是从岸上吹来的，那天飘到岸上的东西只有几块木料和一桶巴西猪肉，但那肉早被咸水浸坏，且掺杂着泥沙，根本无法食用。
<br> 
<br> 我这样每天除了觅食就上船干活，直到六月十五日。在此期间，我总是涨潮时外出觅食，退潮时就上船干活。这么多天来，我弄到了不少木料和铁器。如果我会造船，就可以造条小艇了。同时，我又先后搞到了好几块铅皮，大约有一百来磅重。
<br> 
<br> 六月十六日走到海边，看到一只大鳖。这是我上岛后第一次看到这种动物。看来，也许我运气不佳，以前一直没有发现，其实这岛上大鳖不少。后来我发现，要是我在岛的另一边居住，我每天肯定可以捉到好几百只，但同时因鳖满为患，将受害不浅。
<br> 
<br> 六月十七日我把那大鳖拿来煮了吃。在它的肚子里，我还挖出了六十只蛋。当时，我感到鳖肉鲜美无比，是我平生尝到的最佳菜肴。因为自从我踏上这可怕的荒岛，除了山羊和飞禽，还没有吃过别的动物的肉呢！
<br> 
<br> 六月十八日整天下雨，没有出门。我感到这回的雨有点寒意，身子感到有点发冷。我知道，在这个纬度上，这是不常有的事。
<br> 
<br> 六月十九日病得很重，身子直发抖，好像天气太冷了。
<br> 
<br> 六月二十日整夜不能入睡，头很痛，并发热。
<br> 
<br> 六月二十一日全身不舒服。想到自己生病而无人照顾的惨状，不禁怕得要死。自从在赫尔市出发遭遇风暴以来，我第一次祈祷上帝。至于为什么祈祷，祈祷些什么，连自己也说不清楚，因为思绪混乱极了。
<br> 
<br> 六月二十二日身子稍稍舒服一点，但因为生病，还是害怕极了。
<br> 
<br> 六月二十三日病又重了，冷得直发抖，接着是头痛欲裂。
<br> 
<br> 六月二十四日病好多了。
<br> 
<br> 六月二十五日发疟疾，很厉害。发作一次持续七小时，时冷时热，最后终于出了点汗。
<br> 
<br> 六月二十六日好了一点。因为没有东西吃，就带枪出门。身体十分虚弱，但还是打到了一只母山羊。好不容易把山羊拖回家，非常吃力。烤了一点山羊肉吃。很想煮些羊肉汤喝，可是没有锅子。
<br> 
<br> 六月二十七日疟疾再次发作，且来势很凶。在床上躺了一整天，不吃不喝。口里干得要命，但身子太虚弱，连爬起来弄点水喝的力气都没有。再一次祈祷上帝，但头昏昏沉沉的；等头昏过去后，我又不知道该怎样祈祷，只是躺在床上，连声叫喊："上帝，保佑我吧！上帝，可怜我吧！上帝，救救我吧！"这样连续喊了两三小时，寒热渐退，我才昏昏睡去，直到半夜才醒来。醒来后，觉得身子爽快了不少，但仍软弱无力，且口里渴得要命。可是家里没有水，只得躺下等第二天早晨再说。于是，我又睡着了。这一次，我做了一个恶梦。
<br> 
<br> 我梦见我坐在围墙外面的地上，就是地震后刮暴风雨时我坐的地方，看见一个人从一大片乌云中从天而降，四周一片火光。他降落到地上，全身像火一样闪闪发光，使我无法正眼看他。他面目狰狞可怖，非言语所能形容。当他两脚落到地面上时，我仿佛觉得大地都震动了，就像地震发生时一样。更使我惊恐的是，他全身似乎在燃烧，空中火光熠熠。
<br> 
<br> 他一着地，就向我走来，手里拿着一根长矛样的武器，似乎要来杀我。当他走到离我不远的高坡上时，便对我讲话了，那声音真可怕得难以形容。他对我说的话，我只听懂了一句："既然所发生的一切事情都不能使你忏悔，现在就要你的命。"说着，他就举起手中的矛来杀我。
<br> 
<br> 任何人读到我这段记述时，都会感到，这个可怕的梦境，一定把我吓得灵魂出窍，根本无法描绘当时的情景。虽然这仅仅是一个梦，但却十分恐怖。即使醒来后，明知是一场梦，在脑海里留下的印象，也还可怕得难以言传。
<br> 
<br> 天哪！我不信上帝。虽然小时候父亲一直谆谆教诲我，但八年来，我一直过着水手的生活，染上了水手的种种恶习；我交往的人也都和我一样，邪恶缺德，不信上帝。所以，我从父亲那儿受到的一点点良好的教育，也早就消磨殆尽了。这么多年来，我不记得自己曾经敬仰过上帝，也没有反省过自己的行为。我生性愚蠢，善恶不分。即使在一般水手中，我也算得上是个邪恶之徒：冷酷无情，轻率鲁莽，危难中不知敬畏上帝，遇救时也不知道对上帝感恩。
<br> 
<br> 从我前面的自述中，读者可以知道，至今我已遭遇了种种灾难，但我从未想到这一切都是上帝的意旨，也从未想到这一切都是对我罪孽的惩罚，是对我背逆父亲的行为，对我当前深重的罪行，以及对我邪恶生涯的惩罚。当我不顾一切，冒险去非洲蛮荒的海岸，我从未想到这种冒险生涯会给我带来什么后果，也没有祈祷上帝为我指引一条正路，保佑我脱离身边的危险，免遭野兽或野人的袭击。我完全没有想到上帝，想到天意；我的行为完全像一个畜生，只受自然规律的支配，或只听从常识的驱使，甚至连常识都谈不上。
