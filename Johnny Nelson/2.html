They were all alike, he reflected. If it were not for the names they scarcely could be told apart—and it would have been just as well to have numbered them. A collection of shacks, with the over-played brave names. The shack he was riding for was the "Palace," which only rubbed it in. Out of a hundred towns, seventy-five would have their Palace saloon and fifty would have a Delmonico hotel. Dismounting before the door, he went in and saw the proprietor slowly arising from a chair, and he was the fattest man Johnny ever had seen. The visitor's unintentional stare started the conversation for him.
<br> 
<br> "Well, don't you like my looks?" bridled the proprietor.
<br> 
<br> Johnny's expression was one of injured innocence. "Why, I wasn't seein' you," he explained. "I was thinkin'—but now that you mention it, I don't see nothin' th' matter with your looks. Should there be?"
<br> 
<br> The other grunted something, becoming coherent only when the words concerned business. "What's yourn?"
<br> 
<br> "A drink with you, an' some information."
<br> 
<br> "Th' drink goes; but th' information don't."
<br> 
<br> [7]
<br> 
<br> "I take it all back," soliloquized Johnny. "This town don't need a number; it don't even need a name. It's different. It's th' only one this side of Montanny where the barkeeper was hostile at th' start. I'm peaceful. My han's are up, palm out. If you won't give me information, will you tell me where I can eat an' sleep? Which of th' numerous hotels ain't as bad as th' rest of 'em?"
<br> 
<br> Davis Lee Beauregard Green slid a bottle across the bar, sent a glass spinning after it, leaned against the back bar and grinned. "Gunsight ain't impressin' you a hull lot?" he suggested.
<br> 
<br> "Why not? It's got all a man needs, which is why towns are made, ain't it?" Johnny tasted the liquor and downed it. "I allus size up a town by th' liquor it sells. I say Gunsight is a d—d sight better than I thought from a superficial examination."
<br> 
<br> Dave Green, wise in the psychology of the drinking type, decided that the stranger was not and never had been what he regarded as a drinking man; and even went so far in a quick, spontaneous flash of thought, as to tell himself that the stranger never had been drunk. Now, in his opinion, a hard-drinking, two-gun man was "bad;" but a coldly sober, real two-gun man was worse, although possibly less quarrelsome. He was certain that they lived longer. Dave was a good man with a short gun, despite his handicap; but a stirring warning instinct had told him that this stranger was the best who ever had entered his place. This impression came, was recognized, tabbed, and shoved back in his memory, all in a mechanical way. It was too plain to[8] be overlooked by a man who, perhaps without realizing it, studied humanity, although he could not lay a finger on a single thing and call it by name.
<br> 
<br> Dave put the bottle back and washed the glass. "Well," he remarked, "every man sizes things up accordin' to his own way of thinkin', which is why there are so many different opinions about th' same thing." Letting this ponderous nugget sink in, he continued: "I reckon th' bottom of it all is a man's wants. You want good liquor, so a town's good, or bad. Which is as good a way as any other, for it suits you. But, speakin' about eatin'-houses, there's a hotel just around th' corner. It's th' only one in town. It butts up agin' th' corner of my rear wall. Further than sayin' I've et there, I got no remarks to make. I cook my own, owin' to th' pressure of business, an' choice."
<br> 
<br> "It ain't run by no woman, is it?" asked Johnny.
<br> 
<br> "No; why?"
<br> 
<br> Johnny grinned. "I'm ridin' clear of wimmin. It was wimmin that sent me roamin' over th' face of th' earth, a wanderer. My friends all got married, an'—oh, well, I drifted. Th' first section I come to where there ain't none, I'll tie fast; an' this country looks like a snubbin' post, to me."
<br> 
<br> "You lose," chuckled Dave. "There's one down here, an' some folks think she's considerable. What's more, she's lookin' for a good man to run her dad's ranch, an' get an outfit together, as will stay put. But if you don't like 'em, that loses th' job for you. An' I reckon yo're right lucky at that."
<br> 
<br> "Shore; I know th' kind of a 'good' man they want,"[9] said Johnny, reminiscently. "'Good,' meanin' habits only. A man that don't smoke, chew, drink, cuss, get mad, or keep his hat on in th' house. Losin' th' job ain't bendin' my shoulders. I ain't lookin' for work; I'm dodgin' it. Goin' to loaf till my money peters out, which won't be soon. You'd be surprised if you knowed how many people between here an' Montanny think they can play poker. Just now I'm a eddicator. I'm peddlin' knowledge to th' ignorant, an' I ain't no gambler, at that!"
<br> 
<br> Dave chuckled. "There's some around here, too. Now, me; I'm different. I can't play, an' I know it; but, of course, I'll set in, just for th' excitement of it, once in a while, if there ain't nothin' else to do. Come to think of it, I got a deck of cards around here some'rs, right now."
<br> 
<br> The rear door opened and closed. Johnny looked up and saw the worst-looking tramp of his experience. The newcomer picked up a sand-box cuspidor and started with it for the street.
<br> 
<br> "Hi, stranger!" called Johnny. "Ain't that dusty work?"
<br> 
<br> The tramp stiffened. He hardly could believe his ears. The tones which had assailed them were so spontaneously friendly that for a moment he was stunned. It had been a long time since he had been hailed like that—far too long a time. He turned his head slowly and looked and believed, for the grin which met his eyes was as sincere as the voice. It made him honest in his reply.
<br> 
<br> "No," he said, "this here's sand."
<br> 
<br> [10]
<br> 
<br> "But ain't yore throat dusty?"
<br> 
<br> Two-Spot put the box down. "Seems like it allus is. If these boxes get dusty, I'll know how it come about, me bendin' over 'em like I do, an' breathin' on 'em."
<br> 
<br> Johnny laughed. "I take it we're all dusty." He turned to Dave. "Got three left?"
<br> 
<br> Two-Spot walked up to the bar. Usually he sidled. He picked up his glass and held it up to the light, and drank it in three swallows. Usually it was one gulp. Wiping his lips on a sleeve, he pushed back the glass, dug down into a pocket and brought up a silver dollar, which he tossed onto the bar. "Fill 'em again, Dave," he said, quietly.
<br> 
<br> At this Dave's slowly accumulating wonder leaped. He looked at the coin and from it to Two-Spot. Sensing the situation, Johnny pushed it farther along towards the proprietor. "Our friend is right, Dave," he said, "two is company. Make mine th' same."
<br> 
<br> Two-Spot put down his empty glass and grinned. "I'll now go on from where I was interrupted, Gents," and, picking up the box, went towards the door. As he was about to pass through he saw Pepper, and he stopped. "Good, Lord!" he muttered. "What a hoss! I've seen passels of hosses, but never one like that. Midnight her name oughter be, or Thunderbolt." He turned. "Stranger, what name do you call that hoss?"
<br> 
<br> Johnny looked around. "That's Pepper."
<br> 
<br> Two-Spot grinned. "Did you see that?" he demanded, tilting the box until the sand ran out. "Did you see it? She knows her name like a child. Well,[11] it's a good name—a fair name," he hedged. "But, shucks! There ain't no name fit for that hoss! How fur has she come today?"
<br> 
<br> "Near forty miles," answered Johnny.
<br> 
<br> "I say it ag'in—there ain't no name fit for that hoss. She looks like she come five," and he passed out.
<br> 
<br> "Don't mind him," said Dave. "But where did he git that dollar? Steal it? Find it? Reckon he found it. I near dropped dead. Pore devil—he come here last winter an' walks in, cleans my boxes an' sweeps. Then he goes 'round to th' hotel an' mops an' cleans th' pans better than they ever was before. He was so handy an' useful that we let him stay. An' I've never seen him more than half drunk—it's amazin' th' liquor he can hold."
<br> 
<br> "Sleep here?"
<br> 
<br> "No; an' nobody knows where he does sleep. He's cunnin' as a fox, an' fooled 'em every time. But wherever it is, it's dry."
<br> 
<br> Johnny produced a Sharp's single-shot cartridge. "Where can I get some of these Specials?" he asked.
<br> 
<br> Dave looked at it "'.45-120-550'—you won't get none of 'em down in this country."
<br> 
<br> "Post office in town?"
<br> 
<br> "Not yet. Th' nearest is Rawlins, thirty mile east, with th' worst trail a man ever rode. Th' next is Highbank, forty mile south. We use that, for th' trail's good. We get mail about twice a month. Th' Bar H an' th' Triangle take turns at it."
<br> 
<br> "Then I'll write for some of these after I feed. I'll[12] tell 'em to send 'em to you, at Highbank. What name will I give?"
<br> 
<br> "Dave Green, Highbank-Gunsight mail. But you better write before you eat. This is goin' away day, an' th' Bar H will be in any minute now."
<br> 
<br> Johnny arose. "Not before I eat. I ain't had nothin' since daybreak, an' it's afternoon now. I hate letter writin'; an' if I don't eat soon I'll get thin."
<br> 
<br> "Then don't eat—'though I wasn't thinkin' of you when I spoke," growled Dave. "Wish I was in danger of gettin' thin."
<br> 
<br> "What you care?" demanded Johnny. "Yo're healthy, an' yore job don't call for a man bein' light."
<br> 
<br> "That's th' way you fellers talk," said Dave. "I'm short-winded, I'm in my own way, an' the joke of th' country. I can't ride a hoss—why, cuss it, I can't even get a gun out quick enough to get a hop-toad before he's moved twenty feet!"
<br> 
<br> "Pullin' a gun has its advantages, I admits," replied Johnny, who had his own ideas about Dave's ability in that line. Dave, he thought, could get a gun out quick enough for the average need—being a bartender, and still alive, was proof enough of that. He walked toward the door. "If you was to get a big hoss—a single-footer, you could ride, all right."
<br> 
<br> He went around and entered the hotel, mentally numbering it. Arranging for a week's board and bed for himself and Pepper, he hurried out to the wash bench just outside the dining-room door, where he found two tin basins, a bucket of water, a cake of yellow soap, a towel, and two men using them all. Taking his turn[13] he in turn followed them into the dining-room and chose the fourth and last table, which was next to a window. The meal was better than he had expected but, hungry as he was, he did not eat as hurriedly as was his habit. Fragments of the conversation of the two punchers in the corner reached and interested him. It had to do with the SV ranch, as near as he could judge, and helped him to build the skeleton upon which he hoped to hang a body by dint of investigation and questioning. The episode of that morning had occurred on the SV ranch if the brands on the cattle he had seen meant anything. The woman's name was Arnold, and she had a father and a brother, the latter a boy. There was a fragment about "th' Doc," but just what it was he did not hear, except that it was coupled to the Bar H. Also, something was afoot, but it was so cautiously mentioned that he gained no information about it. Finishing before him, the two men went out, and soon rode past the window, mounted on Triangle horses.
<br> 
<br> He rattled his cup and ordered it refilled, and when the waiter slouched back with it, Johnny slid a perfectly good cigar across the table and waved his hand. "Sit down, an' smoke. You ought to rest while you got th' chance."
<br> 
<br> The waiter lost some of his slouch and obeyed, nodding his thanks. "Are you punchin'?" he asked.
<br> 
<br> "When I'm broke," answered Johnny. "Just now I'm ridin' around lookin' at th' scenery. Never knowed we had any out here till I heard some Easterners goin' mad about it. I've been tryin' to find it ever since. But, anyhow, punchin' is shore monotonous."
<br> 
<br> [14]
<br> 
<br> "If you can show me anythin' monotoner than this job, I'll eat it," growled the waiter. "It's hell on wheels for me."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, this whole range is monotonous," grunted Johnny. "Reckon nothin' interestin' has happened down here since Moses got lost. But there's one thing I like about it—there ain't no woman in thirty miles."
<br> 
<br> "You foller Clear River into Green Valley, which is SV, an' you'll change yore mind," chuckled the waiter. "She'll chase you off, too."
<br> 
<br> "I'll be cussed. An' she's suspicious of strangers?"
<br> 
<br> "Don't put no limit on it like that; she's suspicious of everythin' that wears pants."
<br> 
<br> "How's that?"
<br> 
<br> "Well, her cows has been wanderin' off, lookin' for better grass, I reckon, an' she thinks they're bein' drove."
<br> 
<br> Johnny pictured the valley, but hid his smile. "Oh, well; you can't blame the cows. They'll find th' best. Any ranches 'round here run by men?"
<br> 
<br> "Shore; three of 'em. There's th' Bar H, an' th' Triangle, an' over west is th' Double X, but it's ranchhouse is so fur from here that it's a sort of outsider. It's th' biggest, th' Bar H is next, an' then comes th' Triangle. Th' Triangle don't hardly count, neither 'though it's close by."
<br> 
<br> "What about th' SV you mentioned? An' what's yore name?"
<br> 
<br> "My name's George. Th' SV has gone to th' dogs since it was sold. It ain't a ranch no more. Of course, it's got range, an' water, an' some cows, an' a couple[15] of buildin's—but it ain't got no outfit. Old Arnold, his gal, an' his kid—all tenderfeet—are tryin' to run it."
<br> 
<br> "But they've got to have punchers," objected Johnny.
<br> 
<br> "They can't keep 'em, though I ain't sayin' why," replied George mysteriously.
<br> 
<br> "Does th' Doc own th' Bar H?" asked Johnny.
<br> 
<br> "Lord, no! It owns him—but, say; you'll have to excuse me. I got work to do. See you at supper. So long."
<br> 
<br> Johnny left and rode back the way he had come that morning, lost in meditation. Reaching the rim of the valley he looked down over the rolling expanse of vivid green, here and there broken by shallow draws, with their brush and trees. He noticed an irregular circle of posts just south of him and close to the river. Experience told him what they meant, and he frowned. Here was a discordant note—that enclosure, small as it was, was a thing sinister, malevolent, to him almost possessing a personality. Turning from the quicksands he sat and gazed at the nest of rocks below him until Pepper, well trained though she was, became restless and thought it time to move. Stirring, he smiled and pressed a knee against her and as he rode away he shook his head. "Yes, girl, I'm still a-rollin'—an' I don't know where to."
<br> 
<br> After supper he talked with George until they heard the creaking of wheels and harness. Looking up they saw four heavy horses slowly passing the window, followed by a huge, covered wagon with great, heavy wheels having four-inch tires. A grizzled, whiskered,[16] weather-beaten patriarch handled the lines and talked to his horses as though they were children.
<br> 
<br> "Now I got to make a new fire an' cook more grub," growled George, arising. "Why can't he get here in time for supper? He's allus late, goin' an' comin'."
<br> 
<br> "Who is he, an' where's he from?"
<br> 
<br> "Ol' Buffaler Wheatley from Highbank. He's goin' up to Juniper an' Sherman."
<br> 
<br> "He come from Highbank today?" demanded Johnny, surprised.
<br> 
<br> "Shore—an' he must 'a' come slow."
<br> 
<br> "Slow? Forty miles with that in a day, an' he come slow?" retorted Johnny. "He was lucky to get here before midnight. If you'd 'a' done what that old feller has today, you'd not think much of anybody as wanted you on hand at supper time."
<br> 
<br> "Mebby yo're right," conceded George, dubiously, as he went into the kitchen.
<br> 
<br> Johnny arose and went out to the shed where the driver was flexing his muscles. "Howd'y," he said. "Got th' waggin where you want it?"
<br> 
<br> "Howd'y, friend," replied Buffalo, looking out from under bushy brows. "I reckon so. 'Most any place'll do. Ain't nothin' 'round'll scratch th' polish off it," he grinned.
<br> 
<br> Johnny laughed and began unhitching the tired, patient horses, and his deft fingers had it done before Buffalo had any more than started. "Fine hosses," he complimented, slapping the big gray at his side. "You must treat 'em well."
<br> 
<br> "I do," said Buffalo. "I may abuse myself, some[17]times, but not these here fellers. They'll pull all day, an' are as gentle as kittens."
<br> 
<br> "How do you find freightin'?" asked Johnny, leading his pair into the shed.
<br> 
<br> "Pickin' up, an' pickin' fast," answered Buffalo, following with the second team. "It's gettin' too much for one old man an' this waggin. An' top of that I got th' mail contract I been askin' for for years. So I got to put on another waggin an' make th' trip every week 'stead of only when th' freight piles up enough to make it worth while. Reckon I'll break my boy in on th' new waggin."
<br> 
<br> "I'll leave th' feedin' to you," said Johnny, leaning against the wall. "You know what they need."
<br> 
<br> "All right, friend; much obliged to you. I just let 'em eat all th' hay they can hold an' give 'em their measures of oats. I have to carry them with me—can't get none away from Highbank, everythin' up here bein' grass fed."
<br> 
<br> "I feed oats when I can get 'em," replied Johnny. "I allus reckon a corn-fed hoss has more bottom."
<br> 
<br> "Shore has—if they're that kind," agreed Buffalo.
<br> 
<br> "Travel th' same way all th' time?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes. I won't gain nothin' goin' t'other way 'round," answered Buffalo, busy with his pets. "You see I allus come north loaded. Th' first stop, after here, is Juniper, where I loses part of th' load. That's thirty miles from here, an' th' road's good. Then I cross over to Sherman, lose th' rest of th' load, an' come back from there light—it's fifty mile of hard travelin'. Goin' like I do I has th' good, short haul with th' heavy[18] load; comin' back I have a light waggin on th' long, mean haul. If I went to Sherman first, things would just be turned 'round."
<br> 
<br> "What do you do when you have passengers for Sherman?"
<br> 
<br> "Don't want none!" snorted Buffalo. "Wouldn't carry 'em to Sherman, anyhow. Anybody with sense that can sit a hoss wouldn't crawl along with me in th' heat an' dust on that jouncin' seat. But sometimes I has a tenderfoot to nurse, consarn 'em. They ask so many fool questions I near go loco. But they pays me well for it, you bet!"
<br> 
<br> "Anythin' else I can give you a hand with?" asked Johnny, following the old man out of the shed.
<br> 
<br> "No, thankee; I'm all done. Th' only man that can give me a hand now is that scamp, George. I'm goin' in to eat, friend. Got to be up an' be on my way before th' sun comes up. I get th' cool of th' mornin' for my team, an' give 'em a longer rest when she gets hot. If you see Jim Fanning, tell him I'm buyin' hides as a side line now. I pays spot cash for 'em, same price as Ol' Saunders would pay, less th' freight. He has quit th' business an' went to live with his married da'ter, ol' fool!"
<br> 
<br> "Fanning sell hides?"
<br> 
<br> "No; I just want him to know so he can tell th' Bar H an' th' Triangle an' mebby th' Double X. I want to have a good load goin' back from here. There ain't no profit in goin' all th' way back with an empty waggin. Well, good night, friend! I'm much obliged to you."
<br> 
<br> "That's all right," smiled Johnny. "I'll tell him.[19] Good night; an' good luck!" he added as an after-thought, and then drifted around to the saloon, where he found several men at the bar.
<br> 
<br> Dave performed the introductions, and added: "Nelson, here, says he ain't goin' back punchin' cows as long as his money lasts. He's a travelin' eddicator in th' innercent game of draw—or was it studhoss, Nelson?"
<br> 
<br> "Draw is closer to my heart," laughed Johnny. "My friend, Tex, told me I might learn draw if I lived long enough; but I'd have to have a pack of cards buried with me an' practice in th' other world if I aimed to learn studhoss."
<br> 
<br> "It grieves me to see a young man wastin' his time in idleness," said Ben Dailey, the storekeeper. "Th' devil is allus lookin' for holts. Young men should keep workin'. Might I inquire if you feel like indulgin' in a little game of draw? You'll find us rusty, though."
<br> 
<br> "We don't play oftener than every night, an' some afternoons," said Fanning.
<br> 
<br> "I'm a little scared when a man says he's rusty," replied Johnny. "But I reckon I might as well lose tonight as later. I hope Dave is too busy to cut in—he said he don't know nothin' about it."
<br> 
<br> "Dave's still cuttin' his teeth," chuckled Jim Fanning; "but he uses my silver to cut 'em on. When he learns th' game I'm goin' to drift out of town while I still got a cayuse."
<br> 
<br> Two punchers came stamping in and Dave nodded to them. "Here's yore victims; here's them infants from th' Double X. Boys, say 'Howd'y' to Mr. Nelson.[20] Nelson, that tall, red-headed feller is Slim Hawkes; an' that bowlegged towhead is Tom Wilkes. They ain't been in here in three months, an' they've rid twenty miles to rob us."
<br> 
<br> "An' we might walk home," retorted Wilkes. "Let's lay th' dust before we starts anythin'. Nelson, yo're in bad company. This gang would rob a church. You want to get a kneehold an' hang onto th' pommel after this game starts. Here's how!"
<br> 
<br> As the game progressed the few newcomers who straggled in felt their interest grow. As each finished his drink, Dave would lean forward and whisper: "There's what I call a poker game. Four highway-men playin' 'em close. To listen to 'em you'd think they never saw a card before."
<br> 
<br> Johnny was complaining. "Gents, I know I'm ignorant—but would you advise me to draw to a pair of treys? Shall I hold up an ace, or take three cards? I'll chance it; I never hold a sider. Gimme three."
<br> 
<br> "Ain't that just my luck," sighed Ben. "An' me with three of a kind."
<br> 
<br> A little later Johnny picked up another hand and frowned at it "Well, seein' as I allus hold up a sider, I'll have two, this time."
<br> 
<br> Hoofbeats drummed up and stopped, and a voice was heard outside. Dave looked at the calendar. "Big Tom's a day ahead—he ain't due for his spree till pay-day. Hello, Huff! What you doin' so fur from home?"
<br> 
<br> "Hello, Dave! Hello, boys!" said the newcomer. "I feel purty good tonight. Just got word that Mc[21]Cullough wants two thousand head from us fellers up here. He'll be along with his reg'lar trail outfit in a few weeks. Sixteen men, a four-mule chuck waggin, an' nine saddle hosses to th' man. I'm sendin' word that I can give him a thousand head, an' th' Triangle is goin' to give him five hundred; so he'll want five hundred from th' Double X, which Slim an' Tom can tell Sherwood."
<br> 
<br> "Shore," growled Slim, and his ranch mate nodded.
<br> 
<br> "Goin' up to Dodge again?" queried Dailey.
<br> 
<br> "He didn't say," answered Big Tom. "Who's doin' the scalpin'?" he asked, going over to the table, where he gradually grew more restless as he watched.
<br> 
<br> "Some of these days, when I grows up," grinned Wilkes, "I'm goin' up th' trail with a herd, like a reg'lar cow-puncher. Dodge may be top-heavy with marshals, but I'd like to see it again, with money in my pockets."
<br> 
<br> Slim grunted. "Huh!" He looked over his hand, and drawled: "Th' last time you went up you put on too many airs. Just because Cimarron let you play segundo once in a while when he went on ahead to size up th' water or some river we would have to cross, you got too puffed up. I'm aimin' to be th' second boss th' next trip, an' I'll hand you a few jobs that'll keep you out of mischief."
<br> 
<br> Big Tom watched the winner rake in the chips and could stand it no longer. "Say," he growled, "anybody gettin' tired, an' want to drop out?"
<br> 
<br> Dailey looked up. "I only won two dollars in two hours, an' I got some work to do. Everybody bein' willin', I'll go out an' bury my winnin's."
<br> 
<br> [22]
<br> 
<br> Big Tom took his place. "I'm shore of one thing: I can't lose th' ranch, for I don't own it."
<br> 
<br> A round or two had been played when Big Tom drew his first openers. Johnny raised it and cards were drawn. After it had gone around twice, the others dropped out. Big Tom raised and Johnny helped it along. The betting became stiffer and Big Tom laughed. "I hope you keep on boostin' her."
<br> 
<br> "You can't get me out of this pot with dynamite," replied Johnny, pushing out a raise.
<br> 
<br> Big Tom's gun was out before he left his seat. His chair crashed backward and he leaned over the table. "Meanin'?" he snarled.
<br> 
<br> Johnny, surprised, kept his hand on the chips. "What I said," he answered, evenly.
<br> 
<br> "Tom!" yelled Dave. "He don't mean nothin'! He's a stranger down here."
<br> 
<br> Big Tom's scowl faded at the words. "I reckon I was hasty, Nelson," he said.
<br> 
<br> Johnny spoke slowly, his voice metallic "You was so hasty you come near never gettin' over it. Put down th' gun."
<br> 
<br> "I'm a mite touchy at——"
<br> 
<br> "If you has anythin' to say, put—down—that—gun."
<br> 
<br> "No offense?"
<br> 
<br> "For th' third time: Put—down—that—gun."
<br> 
<br> Big Tom shook his head and appeared to be genuinely sorry. He slid the gun back and picked up his chair. "You raised?"
<br> 
<br> "I did. I advise you to call—and end it."
<br> 
<br> [23]
<br> 
<br> "She's called. Five little hearts," said Big Tom, lying down his cards.
<br> 
<br> "They're hasty, too. Queen full, count 'em. Let's liquor."
<br> 
<br> The foreman paused in indecision. "Nelson——"
<br> 
<br> "We all get touchy," interrupted Johnny, scraping in the winnings. "Will you drink with me?"
<br> 
<br> "I'll take the same," said Big Tom, and he bought the next round, nodded his good night and went out.
<br> 
<br> Johnny turned to Dave. "Will you oblige me by tellin' me what Mr. Huff got huffy about?"
<br> 
<br> Dave hesitated, but Slim Hawkes laughed and answered for him, his slow drawl enhancing the humor of his tale, and wrinkles playing about his eyes and lips told of the enjoyment the picture gave to him. "Clear River crossed our range, flowed through Little Canyon, made a big bend on th' Bar H, passed out of East Canyon, an' flowed down the middle of th' SV. Three years ago a piece of Little Canyon busted loose an' slid down, blockin' th' river, which backed up, getting' higher an' higher, an' began to cut through its bank about three miles above. Big Tom got busy, pronto. He sends for a box of dynamite, sticks it around in th' débris an' let's her go—all of it. When th' earthquake stopped there was a second one in th' dust an' smoke—we all thought it was a delayed charge. It wasn't. It was a section of th' canyon wall, near a hundred feet long an' almost two hundred feet high. There was a shale fault runnin' down from th' top, back about forty feet. Everythin' in front of that was jarred loose an' slid. Th' canyon was choked so hard an'[24] fast that it won't never get open again. Clear River kept right on a-cuttin', an' it now flows on th' other side of Pine Mountain, which means th' Bar H ain't got no water of its own, except a few muddy holes south an' west of th' ranch buildings. That's why he's touchy. But that's a long speech, an' a dry one. Let's all liquor again."The sun was near the meridian when Johnny rode into Gunsight, a town which he took as a matter of course. They were all alike, he reflected. If it were not for the names they scarcely could be told apart—and it would have been just as well to have numbered them. A collection of shacks, with the over-played brave names. The shack he was riding for was the "Palace," which only rubbed it in. Out of a hundred towns, seventy-five would have their Palace saloon and fifty would have a Delmonico hotel. Dismounting before the door, he went in and saw the proprietor slowly arising from a chair, and he was the fattest man Johnny ever had seen. The visitor's unintentional stare started the conversation for him.
<br> 
<br> "Well, don't you like my looks?" bridled the proprietor.
<br> 
<br> Johnny's expression was one of injured innocence. "Why, I wasn't seein' you," he explained. "I was thinkin'—but now that you mention it, I don't see nothin' th' matter with your looks. Should there be?"
<br> 
<br> The other grunted something, becoming coherent only when the words concerned business. "What's yourn?"
<br> 
<br> "A drink with you, an' some information."
<br> 
<br> "Th' drink goes; but th' information don't."
<br> 
<br> [7]
<br> 
<br> "I take it all back," soliloquized Johnny. "This town don't need a number; it don't even need a name. It's different. It's th' only one this side of Montanny where the barkeeper was hostile at th' start. I'm peaceful. My han's are up, palm out. If you won't give me information, will you tell me where I can eat an' sleep? Which of th' numerous hotels ain't as bad as th' rest of 'em?"
<br> 
<br> Davis Lee Beauregard Green slid a bottle across the bar, sent a glass spinning after it, leaned against the back bar and grinned. "Gunsight ain't impressin' you a hull lot?" he suggested.
<br> 
<br> "Why not? It's got all a man needs, which is why towns are made, ain't it?" Johnny tasted the liquor and downed it. "I allus size up a town by th' liquor it sells. I say Gunsight is a d—d sight better than I thought from a superficial examination."
<br> 
<br> Dave Green, wise in the psychology of the drinking type, decided that the stranger was not and never had been what he regarded as a drinking man; and even went so far in a quick, spontaneous flash of thought, as to tell himself that the stranger never had been drunk. Now, in his opinion, a hard-drinking, two-gun man was "bad;" but a coldly sober, real two-gun man was worse, although possibly less quarrelsome. He was certain that they lived longer. Dave was a good man with a short gun, despite his handicap; but a stirring warning instinct had told him that this stranger was the best who ever had entered his place. This impression came, was recognized, tabbed, and shoved back in his memory, all in a mechanical way. It was too plain to[8] be overlooked by a man who, perhaps without realizing it, studied humanity, although he could not lay a finger on a single thing and call it by name.
<br> 
<br> Dave put the bottle back and washed the glass. "Well," he remarked, "every man sizes things up accordin' to his own way of thinkin', which is why there are so many different opinions about th' same thing." Letting this ponderous nugget sink in, he continued: "I reckon th' bottom of it all is a man's wants. You want good liquor, so a town's good, or bad. Which is as good a way as any other, for it suits you. But, speakin' about eatin'-houses, there's a hotel just around th' corner. It's th' only one in town. It butts up agin' th' corner of my rear wall. Further than sayin' I've et there, I got no remarks to make. I cook my own, owin' to th' pressure of business, an' choice."
<br> 
<br> "It ain't run by no woman, is it?" asked Johnny.
<br> 
<br> "No; why?"
<br> 
<br> Johnny grinned. "I'm ridin' clear of wimmin. It was wimmin that sent me roamin' over th' face of th' earth, a wanderer. My friends all got married, an'—oh, well, I drifted. Th' first section I come to where there ain't none, I'll tie fast; an' this country looks like a snubbin' post, to me."
<br> 
<br> "You lose," chuckled Dave. "There's one down here, an' some folks think she's considerable. What's more, she's lookin' for a good man to run her dad's ranch, an' get an outfit together, as will stay put. But if you don't like 'em, that loses th' job for you. An' I reckon yo're right lucky at that."
<br> 
<br> "Shore; I know th' kind of a 'good' man they want,"[9] said Johnny, reminiscently. "'Good,' meanin' habits only. A man that don't smoke, chew, drink, cuss, get mad, or keep his hat on in th' house. Losin' th' job ain't bendin' my shoulders. I ain't lookin' for work; I'm dodgin' it. Goin' to loaf till my money peters out, which won't be soon. You'd be surprised if you knowed how many people between here an' Montanny think they can play poker. Just now I'm a eddicator. I'm peddlin' knowledge to th' ignorant, an' I ain't no gambler, at that!"
<br> 
<br> Dave chuckled. "There's some around here, too. Now, me; I'm different. I can't play, an' I know it; but, of course, I'll set in, just for th' excitement of it, once in a while, if there ain't nothin' else to do. Come to think of it, I got a deck of cards around here some'rs, right now."
<br> 
<br> The rear door opened and closed. Johnny looked up and saw the worst-looking tramp of his experience. The newcomer picked up a sand-box cuspidor and started with it for the street.
<br> 
<br> "Hi, stranger!" called Johnny. "Ain't that dusty work?"
<br> 
<br> The tramp stiffened. He hardly could believe his ears. The tones which had assailed them were so spontaneously friendly that for a moment he was stunned. It had been a long time since he had been hailed like that—far too long a time. He turned his head slowly and looked and believed, for the grin which met his eyes was as sincere as the voice. It made him honest in his reply.
<br> 
<br> "No," he said, "this here's sand."
<br> 
<br> [10]
<br> 
<br> "But ain't yore throat dusty?"
<br> 
<br> Two-Spot put the box down. "Seems like it allus is. If these boxes get dusty, I'll know how it come about, me bendin' over 'em like I do, an' breathin' on 'em."
<br> 
<br> Johnny laughed. "I take it we're all dusty." He turned to Dave. "Got three left?"
<br> 
<br> Two-Spot walked up to the bar. Usually he sidled. He picked up his glass and held it up to the light, and drank it in three swallows. Usually it was one gulp. Wiping his lips on a sleeve, he pushed back the glass, dug down into a pocket and brought up a silver dollar, which he tossed onto the bar. "Fill 'em again, Dave," he said, quietly.
<br> 
<br> At this Dave's slowly accumulating wonder leaped. He looked at the coin and from it to Two-Spot. Sensing the situation, Johnny pushed it farther along towards the proprietor. "Our friend is right, Dave," he said, "two is company. Make mine th' same."
<br> 
<br> Two-Spot put down his empty glass and grinned. "I'll now go on from where I was interrupted, Gents," and, picking up the box, went towards the door. As he was about to pass through he saw Pepper, and he stopped. "Good, Lord!" he muttered. "What a hoss! I've seen passels of hosses, but never one like that. Midnight her name oughter be, or Thunderbolt." He turned. "Stranger, what name do you call that hoss?"
<br> 
<br> Johnny looked around. "That's Pepper."
<br> 
<br> Two-Spot grinned. "Did you see that?" he demanded, tilting the box until the sand ran out. "Did you see it? She knows her name like a child. Well,[11] it's a good name—a fair name," he hedged. "But, shucks! There ain't no name fit for that hoss! How fur has she come today?"
<br> 
<br> "Near forty miles," answered Johnny.
<br> 
<br> "I say it ag'in—there ain't no name fit for that hoss. She looks like she come five," and he passed out.
<br> 
<br> "Don't mind him," said Dave. "But where did he git that dollar? Steal it? Find it? Reckon he found it. I near dropped dead. Pore devil—he come here last winter an' walks in, cleans my boxes an' sweeps. Then he goes 'round to th' hotel an' mops an' cleans th' pans better than they ever was before. He was so handy an' useful that we let him stay. An' I've never seen him more than half drunk—it's amazin' th' liquor he can hold."
<br> 
<br> "Sleep here?"
<br> 
<br> "No; an' nobody knows where he does sleep. He's cunnin' as a fox, an' fooled 'em every time. But wherever it is, it's dry."
<br> 
<br> Johnny produced a Sharp's single-shot cartridge. "Where can I get some of these Specials?" he asked.
<br> 
<br> Dave looked at it "'.45-120-550'—you won't get none of 'em down in this country."
<br> 
<br> "Post office in town?"
<br> 
<br> "Not yet. Th' nearest is Rawlins, thirty mile east, with th' worst trail a man ever rode. Th' next is Highbank, forty mile south. We use that, for th' trail's good. We get mail about twice a month. Th' Bar H an' th' Triangle take turns at it."
<br> 
<br> "Then I'll write for some of these after I feed. I'll[12] tell 'em to send 'em to you, at Highbank. What name will I give?"
<br> 
<br> "Dave Green, Highbank-Gunsight mail. But you better write before you eat. This is goin' away day, an' th' Bar H will be in any minute now."
<br> 
<br> Johnny arose. "Not before I eat. I ain't had nothin' since daybreak, an' it's afternoon now. I hate letter writin'; an' if I don't eat soon I'll get thin."
<br> 
<br> "Then don't eat—'though I wasn't thinkin' of you when I spoke," growled Dave. "Wish I was in danger of gettin' thin."
<br> 
<br> "What you care?" demanded Johnny. "Yo're healthy, an' yore job don't call for a man bein' light."
<br> 
<br> "That's th' way you fellers talk," said Dave. "I'm short-winded, I'm in my own way, an' the joke of th' country. I can't ride a hoss—why, cuss it, I can't even get a gun out quick enough to get a hop-toad before he's moved twenty feet!"
<br> 
<br> "Pullin' a gun has its advantages, I admits," replied Johnny, who had his own ideas about Dave's ability in that line. Dave, he thought, could get a gun out quick enough for the average need—being a bartender, and still alive, was proof enough of that. He walked toward the door. "If you was to get a big hoss—a single-footer, you could ride, all right."
<br> 
<br> He went around and entered the hotel, mentally numbering it. Arranging for a week's board and bed for himself and Pepper, he hurried out to the wash bench just outside the dining-room door, where he found two tin basins, a bucket of water, a cake of yellow soap, a towel, and two men using them all. Taking his turn[13] he in turn followed them into the dining-room and chose the fourth and last table, which was next to a window. The meal was better than he had expected but, hungry as he was, he did not eat as hurriedly as was his habit. Fragments of the conversation of the two punchers in the corner reached and interested him. It had to do with the SV ranch, as near as he could judge, and helped him to build the skeleton upon which he hoped to hang a body by dint of investigation and questioning. The episode of that morning had occurred on the SV ranch if the brands on the cattle he had seen meant anything. The woman's name was Arnold, and she had a father and a brother, the latter a boy. There was a fragment about "th' Doc," but just what it was he did not hear, except that it was coupled to the Bar H. Also, something was afoot, but it was so cautiously mentioned that he gained no information about it. Finishing before him, the two men went out, and soon rode past the window, mounted on Triangle horses.
<br> 
<br> He rattled his cup and ordered it refilled, and when the waiter slouched back with it, Johnny slid a perfectly good cigar across the table and waved his hand. "Sit down, an' smoke. You ought to rest while you got th' chance."
<br> 
<br> The waiter lost some of his slouch and obeyed, nodding his thanks. "Are you punchin'?" he asked.
<br> 
<br> "When I'm broke," answered Johnny. "Just now I'm ridin' around lookin' at th' scenery. Never knowed we had any out here till I heard some Easterners goin' mad about it. I've been tryin' to find it ever since. But, anyhow, punchin' is shore monotonous."
<br> 
<br> [14]
<br> 
<br> "If you can show me anythin' monotoner than this job, I'll eat it," growled the waiter. "It's hell on wheels for me."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, this whole range is monotonous," grunted Johnny. "Reckon nothin' interestin' has happened down here since Moses got lost. But there's one thing I like about it—there ain't no woman in thirty miles."
<br> 
<br> "You foller Clear River into Green Valley, which is SV, an' you'll change yore mind," chuckled the waiter. "She'll chase you off, too."
<br> 
<br> "I'll be cussed. An' she's suspicious of strangers?"
<br> 
<br> "Don't put no limit on it like that; she's suspicious of everythin' that wears pants."
<br> 
<br> "How's that?"
<br> 
<br> "Well, her cows has been wanderin' off, lookin' for better grass, I reckon, an' she thinks they're bein' drove."
<br> 
<br> Johnny pictured the valley, but hid his smile. "Oh, well; you can't blame the cows. They'll find th' best. Any ranches 'round here run by men?"
<br> 
<br> "Shore; three of 'em. There's th' Bar H, an' th' Triangle, an' over west is th' Double X, but it's ranchhouse is so fur from here that it's a sort of outsider. It's th' biggest, th' Bar H is next, an' then comes th' Triangle. Th' Triangle don't hardly count, neither 'though it's close by."
<br> 
<br> "What about th' SV you mentioned? An' what's yore name?"
<br> 
<br> "My name's George. Th' SV has gone to th' dogs since it was sold. It ain't a ranch no more. Of course, it's got range, an' water, an' some cows, an' a couple[15] of buildin's—but it ain't got no outfit. Old Arnold, his gal, an' his kid—all tenderfeet—are tryin' to run it."
<br> 
<br> "But they've got to have punchers," objected Johnny.
<br> 
<br> "They can't keep 'em, though I ain't sayin' why," replied George mysteriously.
<br> 
<br> "Does th' Doc own th' Bar H?" asked Johnny.
<br> 
<br> "Lord, no! It owns him—but, say; you'll have to excuse me. I got work to do. See you at supper. So long."
<br> 
<br> Johnny left and rode back the way he had come that morning, lost in meditation. Reaching the rim of the valley he looked down over the rolling expanse of vivid green, here and there broken by shallow draws, with their brush and trees. He noticed an irregular circle of posts just south of him and close to the river. Experience told him what they meant, and he frowned. Here was a discordant note—that enclosure, small as it was, was a thing sinister, malevolent, to him almost possessing a personality. Turning from the quicksands he sat and gazed at the nest of rocks below him until Pepper, well trained though she was, became restless and thought it time to move. Stirring, he smiled and pressed a knee against her and as he rode away he shook his head. "Yes, girl, I'm still a-rollin'—an' I don't know where to."
<br> 
<br> After supper he talked with George until they heard the creaking of wheels and harness. Looking up they saw four heavy horses slowly passing the window, followed by a huge, covered wagon with great, heavy wheels having four-inch tires. A grizzled, whiskered,[16] weather-beaten patriarch handled the lines and talked to his horses as though they were children.
<br> 
<br> "Now I got to make a new fire an' cook more grub," growled George, arising. "Why can't he get here in time for supper? He's allus late, goin' an' comin'."
<br> 
<br> "Who is he, an' where's he from?"
<br> 
<br> "Ol' Buffaler Wheatley from Highbank. He's goin' up to Juniper an' Sherman."
<br> 
<br> "He come from Highbank today?" demanded Johnny, surprised.
<br> 
<br> "Shore—an' he must 'a' come slow."
<br> 
<br> "Slow? Forty miles with that in a day, an' he come slow?" retorted Johnny. "He was lucky to get here before midnight. If you'd 'a' done what that old feller has today, you'd not think much of anybody as wanted you on hand at supper time."
<br> 
<br> "Mebby yo're right," conceded George, dubiously, as he went into the kitchen.
<br> 
<br> Johnny arose and went out to the shed where the driver was flexing his muscles. "Howd'y," he said. "Got th' waggin where you want it?"
<br> 
<br> "Howd'y, friend," replied Buffalo, looking out from under bushy brows. "I reckon so. 'Most any place'll do. Ain't nothin' 'round'll scratch th' polish off it," he grinned.
<br> 
<br> Johnny laughed and began unhitching the tired, patient horses, and his deft fingers had it done before Buffalo had any more than started. "Fine hosses," he complimented, slapping the big gray at his side. "You must treat 'em well."
<br> 
<br> "I do," said Buffalo. "I may abuse myself, some[17]times, but not these here fellers. They'll pull all day, an' are as gentle as kittens."
<br> 
<br> "How do you find freightin'?" asked Johnny, leading his pair into the shed.
<br> 
<br> "Pickin' up, an' pickin' fast," answered Buffalo, following with the second team. "It's gettin' too much for one old man an' this waggin. An' top of that I got th' mail contract I been askin' for for years. So I got to put on another waggin an' make th' trip every week 'stead of only when th' freight piles up enough to make it worth while. Reckon I'll break my boy in on th' new waggin."
<br> 
<br> "I'll leave th' feedin' to you," said Johnny, leaning against the wall. "You know what they need."
<br> 
<br> "All right, friend; much obliged to you. I just let 'em eat all th' hay they can hold an' give 'em their measures of oats. I have to carry them with me—can't get none away from Highbank, everythin' up here bein' grass fed."
<br> 
<br> "I feed oats when I can get 'em," replied Johnny. "I allus reckon a corn-fed hoss has more bottom."
<br> 
<br> "Shore has—if they're that kind," agreed Buffalo.
<br> 
<br> "Travel th' same way all th' time?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes. I won't gain nothin' goin' t'other way 'round," answered Buffalo, busy with his pets. "You see I allus come north loaded. Th' first stop, after here, is Juniper, where I loses part of th' load. That's thirty miles from here, an' th' road's good. Then I cross over to Sherman, lose th' rest of th' load, an' come back from there light—it's fifty mile of hard travelin'. Goin' like I do I has th' good, short haul with th' heavy[18] load; comin' back I have a light waggin on th' long, mean haul. If I went to Sherman first, things would just be turned 'round."
<br> 
<br> "What do you do when you have passengers for Sherman?"
<br> 
<br> "Don't want none!" snorted Buffalo. "Wouldn't carry 'em to Sherman, anyhow. Anybody with sense that can sit a hoss wouldn't crawl along with me in th' heat an' dust on that jouncin' seat. But sometimes I has a tenderfoot to nurse, consarn 'em. They ask so many fool questions I near go loco. But they pays me well for it, you bet!"
<br> 
<br> "Anythin' else I can give you a hand with?" asked Johnny, following the old man out of the shed.
<br> 
<br> "No, thankee; I'm all done. Th' only man that can give me a hand now is that scamp, George. I'm goin' in to eat, friend. Got to be up an' be on my way before th' sun comes up. I get th' cool of th' mornin' for my team, an' give 'em a longer rest when she gets hot. If you see Jim Fanning, tell him I'm buyin' hides as a side line now. I pays spot cash for 'em, same price as Ol' Saunders would pay, less th' freight. He has quit th' business an' went to live with his married da'ter, ol' fool!"
<br> 
<br> "Fanning sell hides?"
<br> 
<br> "No; I just want him to know so he can tell th' Bar H an' th' Triangle an' mebby th' Double X. I want to have a good load goin' back from here. There ain't no profit in goin' all th' way back with an empty waggin. Well, good night, friend! I'm much obliged to you."
<br> 
<br> "That's all right," smiled Johnny. "I'll tell him.[19] Good night; an' good luck!" he added as an after-thought, and then drifted around to the saloon, where he found several men at the bar.
<br> 
<br> Dave performed the introductions, and added: "Nelson, here, says he ain't goin' back punchin' cows as long as his money lasts. He's a travelin' eddicator in th' innercent game of draw—or was it studhoss, Nelson?"
<br> 
<br> "Draw is closer to my heart," laughed Johnny. "My friend, Tex, told me I might learn draw if I lived long enough; but I'd have to have a pack of cards buried with me an' practice in th' other world if I aimed to learn studhoss."
<br> 
<br> "It grieves me to see a young man wastin' his time in idleness," said Ben Dailey, the storekeeper. "Th' devil is allus lookin' for holts. Young men should keep workin'. Might I inquire if you feel like indulgin' in a little game of draw? You'll find us rusty, though."
<br> 
<br> "We don't play oftener than every night, an' some afternoons," said Fanning.
<br> 
<br> "I'm a little scared when a man says he's rusty," replied Johnny. "But I reckon I might as well lose tonight as later. I hope Dave is too busy to cut in—he said he don't know nothin' about it."
<br> 
<br> "Dave's still cuttin' his teeth," chuckled Jim Fanning; "but he uses my silver to cut 'em on. When he learns th' game I'm goin' to drift out of town while I still got a cayuse."
<br> 
<br> Two punchers came stamping in and Dave nodded to them. "Here's yore victims; here's them infants from th' Double X. Boys, say 'Howd'y' to Mr. Nelson.[20] Nelson, that tall, red-headed feller is Slim Hawkes; an' that bowlegged towhead is Tom Wilkes. They ain't been in here in three months, an' they've rid twenty miles to rob us."
<br> 
<br> "An' we might walk home," retorted Wilkes. "Let's lay th' dust before we starts anythin'. Nelson, yo're in bad company. This gang would rob a church. You want to get a kneehold an' hang onto th' pommel after this game starts. Here's how!"
<br> 
<br> As the game progressed the few newcomers who straggled in felt their interest grow. As each finished his drink, Dave would lean forward and whisper: "There's what I call a poker game. Four highway-men playin' 'em close. To listen to 'em you'd think they never saw a card before."
<br> 
<br> Johnny was complaining. "Gents, I know I'm ignorant—but would you advise me to draw to a pair of treys? Shall I hold up an ace, or take three cards? I'll chance it; I never hold a sider. Gimme three."
<br> 
<br> "Ain't that just my luck," sighed Ben. "An' me with three of a kind."
<br> 
<br> A little later Johnny picked up another hand and frowned at it "Well, seein' as I allus hold up a sider, I'll have two, this time."
<br> 
<br> Hoofbeats drummed up and stopped, and a voice was heard outside. Dave looked at the calendar. "Big Tom's a day ahead—he ain't due for his spree till pay-day. Hello, Huff! What you doin' so fur from home?"
<br> 
<br> "Hello, Dave! Hello, boys!" said the newcomer. "I feel purty good tonight. Just got word that Mc[21]Cullough wants two thousand head from us fellers up here. He'll be along with his reg'lar trail outfit in a few weeks. Sixteen men, a four-mule chuck waggin, an' nine saddle hosses to th' man. I'm sendin' word that I can give him a thousand head, an' th' Triangle is goin' to give him five hundred; so he'll want five hundred from th' Double X, which Slim an' Tom can tell Sherwood."
<br> 
<br> "Shore," growled Slim, and his ranch mate nodded.
<br> 
<br> "Goin' up to Dodge again?" queried Dailey.
<br> 
<br> "He didn't say," answered Big Tom. "Who's doin' the scalpin'?" he asked, going over to the table, where he gradually grew more restless as he watched.
<br> 
<br> "Some of these days, when I grows up," grinned Wilkes, "I'm goin' up th' trail with a herd, like a reg'lar cow-puncher. Dodge may be top-heavy with marshals, but I'd like to see it again, with money in my pockets."
<br> 
<br> Slim grunted. "Huh!" He looked over his hand, and drawled: "Th' last time you went up you put on too many airs. Just because Cimarron let you play segundo once in a while when he went on ahead to size up th' water or some river we would have to cross, you got too puffed up. I'm aimin' to be th' second boss th' next trip, an' I'll hand you a few jobs that'll keep you out of mischief."
<br> 
<br> Big Tom watched the winner rake in the chips and could stand it no longer. "Say," he growled, "anybody gettin' tired, an' want to drop out?"
<br> 
<br> Dailey looked up. "I only won two dollars in two hours, an' I got some work to do. Everybody bein' willin', I'll go out an' bury my winnin's."
<br> 
<br> [22]
<br> 
<br> Big Tom took his place. "I'm shore of one thing: I can't lose th' ranch, for I don't own it."
<br> 
<br> A round or two had been played when Big Tom drew his first openers. Johnny raised it and cards were drawn. After it had gone around twice, the others dropped out. Big Tom raised and Johnny helped it along. The betting became stiffer and Big Tom laughed. "I hope you keep on boostin' her."
<br> 
<br> "You can't get me out of this pot with dynamite," replied Johnny, pushing out a raise.
<br> 
<br> Big Tom's gun was out before he left his seat. His chair crashed backward and he leaned over the table. "Meanin'?" he snarled.
<br> 
<br> Johnny, surprised, kept his hand on the chips. "What I said," he answered, evenly.
<br> 
<br> "Tom!" yelled Dave. "He don't mean nothin'! He's a stranger down here."
<br> 
<br> Big Tom's scowl faded at the words. "I reckon I was hasty, Nelson," he said.
<br> 
<br> Johnny spoke slowly, his voice metallic "You was so hasty you come near never gettin' over it. Put down th' gun."
<br> 
<br> "I'm a mite touchy at——"
<br> 
<br> "If you has anythin' to say, put—down—that—gun."
<br> 
<br> "No offense?"
<br> 
<br> "For th' third time: Put—down—that—gun."
<br> 
<br> Big Tom shook his head and appeared to be genuinely sorry. He slid the gun back and picked up his chair. "You raised?"
<br> 
<br> "I did. I advise you to call—and end it."
<br> 
<br> [23]
<br> 
<br> "She's called. Five little hearts," said Big Tom, lying down his cards.
<br> 
<br> "They're hasty, too. Queen full, count 'em. Let's liquor."
<br> 
<br> The foreman paused in indecision. "Nelson——"
<br> 
<br> "We all get touchy," interrupted Johnny, scraping in the winnings. "Will you drink with me?"
<br> 
<br> "I'll take the same," said Big Tom, and he bought the next round, nodded his good night and went out.
<br> 
<br> Johnny turned to Dave. "Will you oblige me by tellin' me what Mr. Huff got huffy about?"
<br> 
<br> Dave hesitated, but Slim Hawkes laughed and answered for him, his slow drawl enhancing the humor of his tale, and wrinkles playing about his eyes and lips told of the enjoyment the picture gave to him. "Clear River crossed our range, flowed through Little Canyon, made a big bend on th' Bar H, passed out of East Canyon, an' flowed down the middle of th' SV. Three years ago a piece of Little Canyon busted loose an' slid down, blockin' th' river, which backed up, getting' higher an' higher, an' began to cut through its bank about three miles above. Big Tom got busy, pronto. He sends for a box of dynamite, sticks it around in th' débris an' let's her go—all of it. When th' earthquake stopped there was a second one in th' dust an' smoke—we all thought it was a delayed charge. It wasn't. It was a section of th' canyon wall, near a hundred feet long an' almost two hundred feet high. There was a shale fault runnin' down from th' top, back about forty feet. Everythin' in front of that was jarred loose an' slid. Th' canyon was choked so hard an'[24] fast that it won't never get open again. Clear River kept right on a-cuttin', an' it now flows on th' other side of Pine Mountain, which means th' Bar H ain't got no water of its own, except a few muddy holes south an' west of th' ranch buildings. That's why he's touchy. But that's a long speech, an' a dry one. Let's all liquor again."
