I went three whole days without seeing him. Every evening I shook my clothes, uselessly repeating my search. I would have given ten years of my life, and paid a large sum of money, to have found him. I blamed myself for not having looked thoroughly; perhaps I had left him on the ground among the coarse Chinese mats of the house in which I had passed the night.
<br> 
<br> On the third evening, having a little spare time, I started to develop some instantaneous photographs that I had taken during the journey.
<br> 
<br> To my immense surprise Fiam appeared in every picture, or rather his shadow, thrown across each landscape. It was evident that Fiam was shut up inside of the camera. I opened it and called inside: “Fiam!” holding it near my ear.
<br> 
<br> “For pity’s sake help me!” It was his little voice [106] beseeching. “Take me out of this!” He was so desperate that he had forgotten his usual correction of “Miferino.”
<br> 
<br> “Come out yourself.”
<br> 
<br> “I can’t. They are holding me by the leg.”
<br> 
<br> “Who are?”
<br> 
<br> “I don’t know who; please help me.”
<br> 
<br> I looked and saw my friend held by one foot caught in the spring of the box. It was not easy to get him out. His foot was broken, and when I put him on the table he limped.
<br> 
<br> “What were you doing in there?”
<br> 
<br> “That awful place,” he whined.
<br> 
<br> “But how did you get in there?”
<br> 
<br> “You left the door open and I wanted to see what it was like. I went in.... What a horrible place! Pitch dark, and every now and then a deafening noise and blinding flash, then grinding wheels. I had to look out or I should have been completely crushed. There wasn’t a safe corner. At last my foot was caught.”
<br> 
<br> “Now,” I said seriously, “you can’t live any longer in your little house. It is for your good. You may [107] live inside of this.” I showed him my silver cigarette case. “You will be comfortable and live like a lord. You see the inside is all decorated.”
<br> 
<br> When he saw the decoration he was resigned, and wanted to see how he felt in his new home which he called the imperial tomb.
<br> 
<br> To make up for depriving him of his liberty at night, I found him a good place to spend his days when he was near me. I put him in the ribbon of my hat; only his little black head stuck outside. He saw everything at enormous distances, and always told me what he had discovered as if he were watching from the bridge of a ship.
<br> 
<br> [108]
<br> 
<br> “There is a city,” he called one day.
<br> 
<br> “How far off?”
<br> 
<br> “Twenty miles.”
<br> 
<br> “Is it large?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, and full of soldiers.”
<br> 
<br> Then I knew we had reached the army, and were getting into the region of the fighting.
<br> 
<br> Fiam had a passion for the top of my hat, which he called the cupola. When I was alone, traveling on foot through the country, observing the position of the armies from a distance, he asked me to let him walk on the brim, which he called the balcony, and then he went around, keeping near the crown so as not to fall off.
