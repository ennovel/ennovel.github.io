<br> 
<br> You know, this was just the time when a great war had broken out between Japan and another empire, and I was ordered to go out and describe what I saw there. While writing up the important events that sent two armies to the front I couldn’t stop to narrate the adventures of my little friend, and so I never put a word about Fiam in any of my writings. Besides, grown people are so incredulous!
<br> 
<br> The war took place in a part of China called Manchuria. In order to get there you have first to travel by railroad to a seaport, then on a ship to China, then on horseback or afoot, crossing plains and mountains for about a hundred miles, and so to the field of battle.
<br> 
<br> In telling his story Fiam had shown so much fear of war that I hadn’t dared to tell him where we were going. He fairly flooded me with questions.
<br> 
<br> [70]
<br> 
<br> “Why do we travel so much?” he asked me one day in the train when I had put him up on my collar so that he could see the country out of the window. I made him look at it well so that he could give me a description of it, as, in fact, he did.
<br> 
<br> “We are traveling to amuse ourselves,” I replied.
<br> 
<br> “Beautiful amusement,” he grumbled, “to be carried by this monster spitting out smoke. It seems to me like going back to that great house where I was split up and cut to pieces. Look up there,” he added after a few moments. “What lovely country! See the roof of that temple through the trees, and that wonderful field of flowers. Let us stop here.”
<br> 
<br> “We can’t.”
<br> 
<br> “Why not, if we are traveling to amuse ourselves?”
<br> 
<br> [71]
<br> 
<br> “Yes, but the amusement will come further on.”
<br> 
<br> Fiam gave a soft whistle—it was his way of sighing. Then he crept down on my shirt to find the silk waterfall and rest a while in a fold; but he couldn’t find any tie. I was wearing a kind of uniform similar to that of the soldiers.
<br> 
<br> “Why are you dressed this way?” he asked in a surprised tone, tapping me on my chin.
<br> 
<br> “It is the fashion in my country.”
<br> 
<br> He whistled again, and going down from button to button he reached my knees.
<br> 
<br> “Why do you wear these great boots?” he said, looking down at my feet, stretching himself out cautiously as if he were an Alpine climber hanging over a precipice.
<br> 
<br> “It is the fashion in my country.”
