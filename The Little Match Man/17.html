<br> 
<br> “Explain yourself,” I commanded.
<br> 
<br> “Put me astride your collar, and I will tell you.”
<br> 
<br> “All right; now talk.”
<br> 
<br> “Do you remember I told you Prince Funato died an old man? And every year at the anniversary of the battle where I had protected him by my branches”—(here Fiam gave two of those sighs of his that sounded like whistles, and observed sadly, “What a [132] beautiful willow I was then!”) “he came to find me?”
<br> 
<br> “Indeed, I remember perfectly.”
<br> 
<br> “Very well; his spirit has entered into one of his descendants.”
<br> 
<br> “That is only a Japanese superstition.”
<br> 
<br> “So you foreigners say; you also think that the Haji is an old Japanese superstition. You have told me so, and yet you see that I really exist.”
<br> 
<br> “That is true. I beg your pardon.”
<br> 
<br> “There is no harm done. Now I have met the man who has the spirit of Prince Funato.”
<br> 
<br> “And who is it?”
<br> 
<br> “The general.”
<br> 
<br> “Not really.”
<br> 
<br> “It is he who is the descendant of the prince.”
<br> 
<br> “How did you find it out?”
<br> 
<br> “I am a Haji, and can see things that men can’t.”
<br> 
<br> “And does the general know it?”
<br> 
<br> “No; the spirit never remembers its former life.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh,” I smiled.
<br> 
<br> “Don’t be so sceptical. You ought to have more faith in me. I can tell you something else.”
<br> 
<br> [133]
<br> 
<br> “Go on, tell it.”
<br> 
<br> “Did you see that tall, serious, gray-haired colonel, with a beautiful beard, seated at the right of the general?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, I think so.”
<br> 
<br> “Colonel of the big thunderbolt?”
<br> 
<br> “The artillery——”
<br> 
<br> “If you like. Well, he is the old warrior that climbed up the mountain alone the last time to greet me. He trembled all over from age. I remember he leaned up against me and said:
<br> 
<br> “‘Honorable Willow, we shall never meet again.’” Another little whistle showed me that Fiam was much moved by his recollections.
<br> 
<br> By this time my European ideas were pretty nearly turned upside down. “What if Fiam should be right?” Two days later I called on the general with the pretext of thanking him for the excellent breakfast of moist bamboo roots that he had given me. I wanted to question him skilfully.
<br> 
<br> I found him with knitted brows bending over a map. Every once in a while he gave an order to some officer, which was received and obeyed in silence. [134] They were coming and going very solemnly. We could hear the tramp of horses arriving and departing outside the tent. Far off the cannon roared.
<br> 
<br> After an exchange of compliments I risked asking the question which was on the tip of my tongue.
<br> 
<br> “General,” I said, “among your ancestors was there one called Funato?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes,” he answered, with some surprise, but with a smile of satisfaction; “Prince Funato Matabaci.”
<br> 
<br> “And after a great battle was he not pursued by an enemy until he was saved by the Haji of a willow?”
<br> 
<br> “Ah, ah!” laughed the general. “I see you are up in the legends of the country. I am glad to hear it.” Then ceasing to laugh, he added: “The fact is that Funato Matabaci went to war with Nitoba Riocito, and in great fright he hid in a wood. All the rest is legendary, and the fancy of an ignorant and credulous age.”
<br> 
<br> Later when I told this to Fiam he was sad and very much hurt.
<br> 
<br> “Well,” he said, “let’s see. Look at the blessings you have brought us from the West. Those lovely inventions that chop down, split and cut poor willows in [135] pieces. These are your beautiful ideas. The most sacred things are only legends to you.”
<br> 
<br> “Fiam, I am....”
<br> 
<br> “You—you are a stupid....”
<br> 
<br> “Ah, thank you.”
<br> 
<br> He couldn’t make me angry with his insults, for after all I thought he was quite right. Some minutes passed in silence, then Fiam went on:
<br> 
<br> “But it doesn’t matter. I love him just the same. It isn’t his fault that he denies me. To me he is still the Funato that I protected as if he were my son, and I promise you I shall never fail to guard, defend, and save him, even if it takes my life.”
<br> 
<br> “But what can you do, poor Fiam?” I asked, much interested.
<br> 
<br> “Ah, who knows? who knows?” and he sighed sadly.
