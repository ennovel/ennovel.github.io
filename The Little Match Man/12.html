Each time it was on account of that hole in his box through which he crawled out to ramble, and which he couldn’t always find on his way back.
<br> 
<br> One morning in a Chinese village, where I had passed the night, just as I was mounting my horse to ride out to the army I discovered that Fiam had disappeared.
<br> 
<br> I looked everywhere, especially among my postage stamps, but couldn’t find him.
<br> 
<br> In the afternoon as I lay under a tree in the stillness of a deserted field I thought I heard his little voice.
<br> 
<br> “Fiam! Fiam!” I called.
<br> 
<br> I could make out the response distinctly:
<br> 
<br> “Miferino! Miferino!”
<br> 
<br> As I was warm I had taken off my waistcoat to use [100] as a pillow as I lay stretched out. The voice came from that.
<br> 
<br> I fumbled around until I found him shut in between the lining and the cloth. I pulled him out and greeted him effusively.
<br> 
<br> “How did you ever get there?”
<br> 
<br> “I have a habit of going out at night.”
<br> 
<br> “A very bad one.”
<br> 
<br> “Well, what do you expect me to do? I don’t sleep. Last night I went out as usual. Your watch near my house made such an abominable noise, tic, tac! It was like a blacksmith’s forge. Never mind. I went out and took a trip over your clothes.”
<br> 
<br> “Over my clothes?”
<br> 
<br> “Exactly; you had thrown them on the floor, and they made a beautiful landscape.”
<br> 
<br> “A landscape?”
<br> 
<br> “Surely. All in a heap they looked like mountains and valleys, ravines, plains, precipices and grottoes—all kinds of things. It was a great pleasure to travel all over it. I climbed up and slid down. I sat on round things like immense tubes.”
<br> 
<br> “They were folds.”
<br> 
<br> [101]
<br> 
<br> “I know it, but your folds are gigantic to me. As I went around I discovered the entrance to a cave. I went in. It was a long tunnel where I had to crawl on all fours. When I got half-way in I wanted to turn around; but I couldn’t, for my hands and feet got caught in the folds, so I had to go forward.”
<br> 
<br> “I see; you were in one of the sleeves.”
<br> 
<br> “When I came out from the tunnel, I discovered a great opening with a shed over it. I entered and found a cavern full of paper.”
<br> 
<br> “It was a pocket.”
<br> 
<br> “I traveled around until I found a little hole I could scarcely squeeze through.”
<br> 
<br> “Ah, yes! My pocket is a little ripped.”
<br> 
<br> “I was now in a large and empty, wearisome place, [102] and when I wanted to get back I couldn’t find the hole through which I entered. Imagine my suffering! After a while I felt you take up the clothes and put them on. I screamed as loud as I could, but you didn’t hear me. I knew that you were looking for me, but I could do nothing. But, at last, you heard me and I am saved.”
<br> 
<br> “I say, Fiam....”
<br> 
<br> “Miferino!”
<br> 
<br> “You ought to promise me not to go out at night or I shall be obliged to make you an iron house and shut you up for a hundred years. Just think, if I lose you the first person who finds you will burn you up without giving you time to say, ‘Ouch!’”
<br> 
<br> He promised. But a few days later he was gone again.
