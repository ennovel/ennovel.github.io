I should never find him again in the bottom of the camera or in the midst of postage stamps! I should never hear his little voice, prompting me with “Miferino.” I should never carry him astride the battlement, or on the crown of my hat. The imperial tomb was empty except for the white cotton bed!
<br> 
<br> I couldn’t sleep. After I don’t know how long the moon rose. I got up to look at the clock. It was midnight. Fiam had been walking four hours. How far had he gone?
<br> 
<br> The firing continued every now and then. “Little thunder,” I thought, remembering the queer idea of my friend. Every few minutes I looked at the clock. One o’clock passed; two o’clock passed. I was getting anxious. I thought an hour had gone by—it was five minutes.
<br> 
<br> At half-past two I began to listen. A quarter to three, three, a quarter past three——
<br> 
<br> [162]
<br> 
<br> I thought he hadn’t found the mine, and I almost felt glad at the idea that I might see him again.
<br> 
<br> Half-past three. The minutes seemed like eternity. Twenty-five minutes to four. Twenty minutes to four——
<br> 
<br> It was (I shall never forget it) at precisely thirteen minutes to four when the night was lighted by an immense brilliant blue light. A few seconds later the whole earth shook and a horrible explosion rent the air. Then silence.
<br> 
<br> It wasn’t long before the trumpets blew. The camp was all commotion. Commands were issued, confused with shouts. These, I made out, were joyful.
<br> 
<br> “The mine has been fired! The mine has been fired!” they repeated again and again.
<br> 
<br> The ranks formed. The regiments drew up in line of march. The officers galloped about. The flags were unfurled.
<br> 
<br> At dawn the columns moved—fresh and eager, as if starting off for the first encounter.
<br> 
<br> The terrible pass was traversed by the soldiers singing while the bayonets glistened in the rising sun. Two hours later we were safely outside the [163] mountainous defile, and were joined by the main army.
<br> 
<br> The enemy was forced to give battle, and was defeated.
<br> 
<br> That evening they all feasted in the general’s tent. All the officers were happy. I alone was sad.
<br> 
<br> After a while they began to ask, Who could have blown up the mine? Some one said:
<br> 
<br> “The soldiers sent to explore returned without finding anything.”
<br> 
<br> “Perhaps,” another suggested, “it blew up of itself on account of poor construction.”
<br> 
<br> “No,” said a third. “It was blown up by the enemy; they thought we were on the march, near the mine.”
<br> 
<br> I arose and said solemnly:
<br> 
<br> “I know who blew up the mine and made your victory and escape possible.”
<br> 
<br> “Tell us, tell us!” they shouted in chorus. “Who?”
<br> 
<br> “It was Fiam, who....”
<br> 
<br> “Who is that?” asked twenty voices at once. “Who is our hero and our rescuer? How did you know him?”
<br> 
<br> “It is,” I proceeded firmly, “the Haji of an old willow tree that....” A tumult of laughter greeted [164] me. Even the general joined in. They thought I was joking. The general cried:
<br> 
<br> “Still more legends, ha, ha!”
<br> 
<br> “I am in earnest,” I said, turning to him, and couldn’t help adding, “It was the Haji of Funato, your Haji.”
<br> 
<br> The laughter increased. “Legends, superstitions, fancies,” I heard in the midst of the hilarity.
<br> 
<br> I was so bewildered I didn’t know whether to get angry or laugh with them.
<br> 
<br> Suddenly I felt a touch on my shoulder. I turned to see an officer looking attentively at me. “My name is Tasa. Let me feel your pulse. Show me your tongue. I recommend a little ice on the head.”
