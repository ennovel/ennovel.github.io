Because of thosevarious moves from city to city in his early youth, he had never been permitted to collect such a sum of practical training in any field as would permit him, so he thought, to aspire to the great worlds of which these menappeared to be a part. Yet his soul now yearned for this. The people who lived in fine houses, who stopped atgreat hotels, and had men like Mr. Squires, and the manager of the bell-hops here, to wait on them and arrangefor their comfort. And he was still a bell-hop. And close to twenty-one. At times it made him very sad. Hewished and wished that he could get into some work where he could rise and be somebody--not always remain abell- hop, as at times he feared he might.</p> 
<p>　　About the time that he reached this conclusion in regard to himself and was meditating on some way to improveand safeguard his future, his uncle, Samuel Griffiths, arrived in Chicago. And having connections here whichmade a card to this club an obvious civility, he came directly to it and for several days was about the placeconferring with individuals who came to see him, or hurrying to and fro to meet people and visit concerns whomhe deemed it important to see.</p> 
<p>　　And it was not an hour after he arrived before Ratterer, who had charge of the pegboard at the door by day andwho had but a moment before finished posting the name of this uncle on the board, signaled to Clyde, who cameover.</p> 
<p>　　"Didn't you say you had an uncle or something by the name of Griffiths in the collar business somewhere in NewYork State?""Sure," replied Clyde. "Samuel Griffiths. He has a big collar factory in Lycurgus. That's his ad you see in all thepapers and that's his fire sign over there on Michigan Avenue.""Would you know him if you saw him?""No," replied Clyde. "I never saw him in all my life.""I'll bet anything it's the same fellow," commented Ratterer, consulting a small registry slip that had been handedhim. "Looka here--Samuel Griffiths, Lycurgus, N. Y. That's probably the same guy, eh?""Surest thing you know," added Clyde, very much interested and even excited, for this was the identical uncleabout whom he had been thinking so long.</p> 
<p>　　"He just went through here a few minutes ago," went on Ratterer. "Devoy took his bags up to K. Swell-lookingman, too. You better keep your eye open and take a look at him when he comes down again. Maybe it's youruncle. He's only medium tall and kinda thin. Wears a small gray mustache and a pearl gray hat. Good-lookin'. I'llpoint him out to you. If it is your uncle you better shine up to him. Maybe he'll do somepin' for you--give you acollar or two," he added, laughing.</p> 
<p>　　Clyde laughed too as though he very much appreciated this joke, although in reality he was flustered. His uncleSamuel! And in this club! Well, then this was his opportunity to introduce himself to his uncle. He had intendedwriting him before ever he secured this place, but now he was here in this club and might speak to him if hechose.</p> 
<p>　　But hold! What would his uncle think of him, supposing he chose to introduce himself? For he was a bell-boyagain and acting in that capacity in this club. What, for instance, might be his uncle's attitude toward boys whoworked as bell-boys, particularly at his-- Clyde's--years. For he was over twenty now, and getting to be pretty oldfor a bell-boy, that is, if one ever intended to be anything else. A man of his wealth and high position might lookon bell-hopping as menial, particularly bell-boys who chanced to be related to him. He might not wish to haveanything to do with him--might not even wish him to address him in any way. It was in this state that heremained for fully twenty-four hours after he knew that his uncle had arrived at this club.</p> 
<p>　　The following afternoon, however, after he had seen him at least half a dozen times and had been able toformulate the most agreeable impressions of him, since his uncle appeared to be so very quick, alert, incisive--sovery different from his father in every way, and so rich and respected by every one here--he began to wonder, tofear even at times, whether he was going to let this remarkable opportunity slip. For after all, his uncle did notlook to him to be at all unkindly--quite the reverse--very pleasant. And when, at the suggestion of Ratterer, hehad gone to his uncle's room to secure a letter which was to be sent by special messenger, his uncle had scarcelylooked at him, but instead had handed him the letter and half a dollar. "See that a boy takes that right away andkeep the money for yourself," he had remarked.</p> 
<p>　　Clyde's excitement was so great at the moment that he wondered that his uncle did not guess that he was hisnephew. But plainly he did not. And he went away a little crest-fallen.</p> 
<p>　　Later some half dozen letters for his uncle having been put in the key-box, Ratterer called Clyde's attention tothem. "If you want to run in on him again, here's your chance. Take those up to him. He's in his room, I think."And Clyde, after some hesitation, had finally taken the letters and gone to his uncle's suite once more.</p> 
<p>　　His uncle was writing at the time and merely called: "Come!" Then Clyde, entering and smiling ratherenigmatically, observed: "Here's some mail for you, Mr. Griffiths.""Thank you very much, my son," replied his uncle and proceeded to finger his vest pocket for change. but Clyde,seizing this opportunity, exclaimed: "Oh, no, I don't want anything for that." And then before his uncle could sayanything more, although he proceeded to hold out some silver to him, he added: "I believe I'm related to you, Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Griffiths. You're Mr. Samuel Griffiths of the Griffiths Collar Company of Lycurgus, aren't you?""Yes, I have a little something to do with it, I believe. Who are you?" returned his uncle, looking at him sharply.</p> 
<p>　　"My name's Clyde Griffiths. My father, Asa Griffiths, is your brother, I believe."At the mention of this particular brother, who, to the knowledge of all the members of this family, was distinctlynot a success materially, the face of Samuel Griffiths clouded the least trifle. For the mention of Asa broughtrather unpleasingly before him the stocky and decidedly not well-groomed figure of his younger brother, whomhe had not seen in so many years. His most recent distinct picture of him was as a young man of about Clyde'sage about his father's house near Bertwick, Vermont. But how different! Clyde's father was then short, fat andpoorly knit mentally as well as physically--oleaginous and a bit mushy, as it were. His chin was not firm, hiseyes a pale watery blue, and his hair frizzled. Whereas this son of his was neat, alert, good-looking andseemingly well-mannered and intelligent, as most bell- hops were inclined to be as he noted. And he liked him.</p> 
<p>　　However, Samuel Griffiths, who along with his elder brother Allen had inherited the bulk of his father'smoderate property, and this because of Joseph Griffiths' prejudice against his youngest son, had always felt thatperhaps an injustice had been done Asa. For Asa, not having proved very practical or intelligent, his father hadfirst attempted to drive and then later ignore him, and finally had turned him out at about Clyde's age, and hadafterward left the bulk of his property, some thirty thousand dollars, to these two elder brothers, share and sharealike--willing Asa but a petty thousand.</p> 
<p>　　It was this thought in connection with this younger brother that now caused him to stare at Clyde rathercuriously. For Clyde, as he could see, was in no way like the younger brother who had been harried from hisfather's home so many years before. Rather he was more like his own son, Gilbert, whom, as he now saw heresembled. Also in spite of all of Clyde's fears he was obviously impressed by the fact that he should have anykind of place in this interesting club. For to Samuel Griffiths, who was more than less confined to the limitedactivities and environment of Lycurgus, the character and standing of this particular club was to be respected.</p> 
<p>　　And those young men who served the guests of such an institution as this, were, in the main, possessed ofefficient and unobtrusive manners. Therefore to see Clyde standing before him in his neat gray and blackuniform and with the air of one whose social manners at least were excellent, caused him to think favorably ofhim.</p> 
<p>　　"You don't tell me!" he exclaimed interestedly. "So you're Asa's son. I do declare! Well, now, this is a surprise.</p> 
<p>　　You see I haven't seen or heard from your father in at least--well, say, twenty-five or six years, anyhow. The lasttime I did hear from him he was living in Grand Rapids, Michigan, I think, or here. He isn't here now, Ipresume.""Oh, no, sir," replied Clyde, who was glad to be able to say this. "The family live in Denver. I'm here all alone.""Your father and mother are living, I presume.""Yes, sir. They're both alive.""Still connected with religious work, is he--your father?""Well, yes, sir," answered Clyde, a little dubiously, for he was still convinced that the form of religious work hisfather essayed was of all forms the poorest and most inconsequential socially. "Only the church he has now," hewent on, "has a lodging house connected with it. About forty rooms, I believe. He and my mother run that andthe mission too.""Oh, I see."He was so anxious to make a better impression on his uncle than the situation seemed to warrant that he wasquite willing to exaggerate a little.</p> 
<p>　　"Well, I'm glad they're doing so well," continued Samuel Griffiths, rather impressed with the trim and vigorousappearance of Clyde. "You like this kind of work, I suppose?""Well, not exactly. No, Mr. Griffiths, I don't," replied Clyde quickly, alive at once to the possibilities of thisquery. "It pays well enough. But I don't like the way you have to make the money you get here. It isn't my idea ofa salary at all. But I got in this because I didn't have a chance to study any particular work or get in with somecompany where there was a real chance to work up and make something of myself. My mother wanted me towrite you once and ask whether there was any chance in your company for me to begin and work up, but I wasafraid maybe that you might not like that exactly, and so I never did."He paused, smiling, and yet with an inquiring look in his eye.</p> 
<p>　　His uncle looked solemnly at him for a moment, pleased by his looks and his general manner of approach in thisinstance, and then replied: "Well, that is very interesting. You should have written, if you wanted to--" Then, aswas his custom in all matters, he cautiously paused. Clyde noted that he was hesitating to encourage him.</p> 
<p>　　"I don't suppose there is anything in your company that you would let me do?" he ventured boldly, after amoment.</p> 
<p>　　Samuel Griffiths merely stared at him thoughtfully. He liked and he did not like this direct request. However,Clyde appeared at least a very adaptable person for the purpose. He seemed bright and ambitious--so much likehis own son, and he might readily fit into some department as head or assistant under his son, once he hadacquired a knowledge of the various manufacturing processes. At any rate he might let him try it. There could beno real harm in that. Besides, there was his younger brother, to whom, perhaps, both he and his older brotherAllen owed some form of obligation, if not exactly restitution.</p> 
<p>　　"Well," he said, after a moment, "that is something I would have to think over a little. I wouldn't be able to say,offhand, whether there is or not. We wouldn't be able to pay you as much as you make here to begin with," hewarned.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, that's all right," exclaimed Clyde, who was far more fascinated by the thought of connecting himself withhis uncle than anything else. "I wouldn't expect very much until I was able to earn it, of course.""Besides, it might be that you would find that you didn't like the collar business once you got into it, or we mightfind we didn't like you. Not every one is suited to it by a long way.""Well, all you'd have to do then would be to discharge me," assured Clyde. "I've always thought I would be,though, ever since I heard of you and your big company."This last remark pleased Samuel Griffiths. Plainly he and his achievements had stood in the nature of an ideal tothis youth.</p> 
<p>　　"Very well," he said. "I won't be able to give any more time to this now. But I'll be here for a day or two more,anyhow, and I'll think it over. It may be that I will be able to do something for you. I can't say now." And heturned quite abruptly to his letters.</p> 
<p>　　And Clyde, feeling that he had made as good an impression as could be expected under the circumstances andthat something might come of it, thanked him profusely and beat a hasty retreat.</p> 
<p>　　The next day, having thought it over and deciding that Clyde, because of his briskness and intelligence, waslikely to prove as useful as another, Samuel Griffiths, after due deliberation as to the situation at home, informedClyde that in case any small opening in the home factory occurred he would be glad to notify him. But he wouldnot even go so far as to guarantee him that an opening would immediately be forthcoming. He must wait.</p> 
<p>　　Accordingly Clyde was left to speculate as to how soon, if ever, a place in his uncle's factory would be made forhim.</p> 
<p>　　In the meanwhile Samuel Griffiths had returned to Lycurgus. And after a later conference with his son, hedecided that Clyde might be inducted into the very bottom of the business at least--the basement of the Griffithsplant, where the shrinking of all fabrics used in connection with the manufacture of collars was brought about,and where beginners in this industry who really desired to acquire the technique of it were placed, for it was hisidea that Clyde by degrees was to be taught the business from top to bottom. And since he must support himselfin some form not absolutely incompatible with the standing of the Griffiths family here in Lycurgus, it wasdecided to pay him the munificent sum of fifteen dollars to begin.</p> 
<p>　　For while Samuel Griffiths, as well as his son Gilbert, realized that this was small pay (not for an ordinaryapprentice but for Clyde, since he was a relative) yet so inclined were both toward the practical rather than thecharitable in connection with all those who worked for them, that the nearer the beginner in this factory was tothe clear mark of necessity and compulsion, the better. Neither could tolerate the socialistic theory relative tocapitalistic exploitation. As both saw it, there had to be higher and higher social orders to which the lower socialclasses could aspire. One had to have castes. One was foolishly interfering with and disrupting necessary andunavoidable social standards when one tried to unduly favor any one--even a relative. It was necessary whendealing with the classes and intelligences below one, commercially or financially, to handle them according tothe standards to which they were accustomed. And the best of these standards were those which held these lowerindividuals to a clear realization of how difficult it was to come by money--to an understanding of how verynecessary it was for all who were engaged in what both considered the only really important constructive workof the world--that of material manufacture--to understand how very essential it was to be drilled, and that sharplyand systematically, in all the details and processes which comprise that constructive work. And so to becomeinured to a narrow and abstemious life in so doing. It was good for their characters. It informed and strengthenedthe minds and spirits of those who were destined to rise. And those who were not should be kept right where theywere.</p> 
<p>　　Accordingly, about a week after that, the nature of Clyde's work having been finally decided upon, a letter wasdispatched to him to Chicago by Samuel Griffiths himself in which he set forth that if he chose he might presenthimself any time now within the next few weeks. But he must give due notice in writing of at least ten days inadvance of his appearance in order that he might be properly arranged for. And upon his arrival he was to seekout Mr. Gilbert Griffiths at the office of the mill, who would look after him.</p> 
<p>　　And upon receipt of this Clyde was very much thrilled and at once wrote to his mother that he had actuallysecured a place with his uncle and was going to Lycurgus. Also that he was going to try to achieve a real success now. Whereupon she wrote him a long letter, urging him to be, oh, so careful of his conduct and associates. Badcompanionship was at the root of nearly all of the errors and failures that befell an ambitious youth such as he. Ifhe would only avoid evil-minded or foolish and headstrong boys and girls, all would be well. It was so easy for ayoung man of his looks and character to be led astray by an evil woman. He had seen what had befallen him inKansas City. But now he was still young and he was going to work for a man who was very rich and who coulddo so much for him, if he would. And he was to write her frequently as to the outcome of his efforts here.</p> 
<p>　　And so, after having notified his uncle as he had requested, Clyde finally took his departure for Lycurgus. But onhis arrival there, since his original notification from his uncle had called for no special hour at which to call atthe factory, he did not go at once, but instead sought out the important hotel of Lycurgus, the Lycurgus House.</p> 
<p>　　Then finding himself with ample time on his hands, and very curious about the character of this city in which hewas to work, and his uncle's position in it, he set forth to look it over, his thought being that once he reported andbegan work he might not soon have the time again. He now ambled out into Central Avenue, the very heart ofLycurgus, which in this section was crossed by several business streets, which together with Central Avenue fora few blocks on either side, appeared to constitute the business center--all there was to the life and gayety ofLycurgus.</p> 不过，克莱德生活中的种种不幸，如按他解释，完全归咎于自己过去没有受过教育。他从幼时起经常随家从这个城市迁至那个城市，始终没让他在某个方面获得一些实际知识使他能够平步青云，成为那个高贵社会的一个成员，而这个高贵社会，正是属于俱乐部里来来往往的那些客人所有。不过，如今他心中正热切渴望自己能进入这么一个高贵社会。这些绅士们住的是漂亮的府邸，出门下榻豪华的大酒店，还有斯夸尔斯先生和这里的侍应生领班这类人侍候他们，让他们得到舒适享受。而他，克莱德，还只不过是一名侍应生。年纪快要二十一岁了。有时真让他够伤心。他整日价梦想能另觅一个什么事由，以便步步高升，做一个了不起的人物……总不能一辈子当侍应生啊。有时候，他一想到这里，就不寒而栗了。
<br> 
<br> 当他对自己作出这么一个结论，心中暗自琢磨怎样才能使自己前途无量的时候，他的伯父塞缪尔。格里菲思来到了芝加哥。本来他同俱乐部就有一些联系，这里对他又特别殷勤，当即邀请他入会。他径直来到了俱乐部，一连好几天，就在这里跟前来拜访他的人交谈，或是来去匆匆，拜访了一些他认为必需拜访的有关人士和厂商。
<br> 
<br> 他到后还不到一个钟头，白天在入口处专管旅客登记的拉特勒，刚把写上克莱德伯父名字的牌子挂到留宿旅客一览牌照上，就跟迎面走来的克莱德打了个招呼。
<br> 
<br> "你不是说你有个伯父，或是一个什么亲戚，也姓格里菲思，在纽约州某某地方经营领子业，是吧?
<br> 
<br> ""是啊，"克莱德回答说。"塞缪尔。格里菲思。他在莱柯格斯开设一家规模宏大的领子工厂。你在各报都可以看到他登的广告。也许你在密执安大街上已看见他的灯光广告。""你要是见到他，还认得不认得?
<br> 
<br> ""不认得，"克莱德回答说。"我从来没见过他哩。""我敢打赌，那包管是他，"拉特勒一口咬定说，一面看着叫他登记的小纸条。
<br> 
<br> "你看……塞缪尔。格里菲思，纽约州莱柯格斯。恐怕就是这个人吧，嗯?
<br> 
<br> ""千真万确，"克莱德接下去说，觉得挺有意思，乃至于很激动。因为有多少个日子，他朝思暮想的，就是这一个伯父啊。
<br> 
<br> "几分钟前他才打这儿走过，"拉特勒继续说着。"德沃埃把他的手提包送到Ｋ号房间去了。看起来是个时髦人物。你最好睁大眼睛，等他下来的时候，把他好好看个清楚呗。也许他就是你的伯父。他中等身材，相当瘦，蓄着一络灰色小胡子，戴一顶银灰色帽子。样子可神气哩。我会指给你看的。要是他真的是你伯父，你还得设法巴结巴结他。说不定他会帮帮你的忙……给你一两条领子什么的，"他一面说着，一面哈哈大笑。
<br> 
<br> 克莱德也笑了起来，好象非常赞赏这个玩笑，其实，他心里却无比激动。
<br> 
<br> 他的伯父塞缪尔!
<br> 
<br> 就在这个俱乐部!
<br> 
<br> 啊，跟伯父相见的大好机会已到了。克莱德在这儿觅到职位以前，一直就想给他写信，如今伯父亲自来到了这个俱乐部，也许还会屈尊俯就，跟他说说话哩。
<br> 
<br> 不过，且慢!
<br> 
<br> 假定说他冒昧地自我介绍的话，那他伯父对他会怎么个想法呢?
<br> 
<br> 因为他到现在充其量还只是在这个俱乐部里当一名侍应生。比方说，对于当侍应生的小伙子，尤其是象他克莱德那样的年纪，他伯父又会持什么样态度呢?
<br> 
<br> 现在他已二十出头了，要是还想干别的事情的话，当这么一个侍应生，年纪已经大了一些。象塞缪尔。格里菲思那样有钱有势的人，也许会把侍应生看成是下贱的，特别碰上这个侍应生正好是他的亲戚。也许他不愿意跟他来往……甚至还不愿意他跟自己说话呢。他知道伯父来到这个俱乐部以后，整整一昼夜，心里始终这样迟疑不决。
<br> 
<br> 可是，到了转天下午，他看见伯父已有五六次了，觉得印象很好。他伯父显得很活泼。机灵。果断……样样都跟他父亲迥然不同，何况他又是那么富有，这儿每个人都尊敬他。克莱德心里开始纳闷，有时甚至感到害怕，担心自己会不会错过了这个难得的机会。依他看，他伯父毕竟还不象是冷若冰霜的人……恰好相反……倒是非常和蔼可亲。后来，还是拉特勒出的主意，克莱德跑到伯父房间去取一封需交专门信差送出的信。殊不知伯父几乎连看都没有看他，只把信和半块美元一起递给了他，说:
<br> 
<br> "派一个人马上送去，这钱是给你的。"克莱德当时心情非常激动，暗自纳闷伯父也许是没有猜到这是他的亲侄儿吧。显然，伯父确实没有猜到。克莱德就不免有点儿垂头丧气地走了。
<br> 
<br> 不久，他伯父的信箱里已有了五六封信，拉特勒又关照克莱德:
<br> 
<br> "如果你心里想要再去找他，这就是你的机会啦。把这些信给他一块送去。我想这会儿他在房间里。"克莱德迟疑了一会儿，终于拿了信，再次上他伯父那个套间去。
<br> 
<br> 他伯父正在写东西，只不过说了一声:
<br> 
<br> "进来!
<br> 
<br> "克莱德走进去，有点儿神秘莫测地微笑着说:
<br> 
<br> "有您几封信，格里菲思先生。""谢谢你，小伙子，"他伯父回答说，一面往马夹口袋里找零钱。克莱德抓住这个机会说:
<br> 
<br> "哦，不，不，这点事就不用给啦。"他伯父正掏出一些银币想给他，可是还来不及说什么的时候，没想到克莱德却接下去说:
<br> 
<br> "我觉得我好象是您的亲戚，格里菲思先生。您就是莱柯格斯格里菲思领子工厂的格里菲思先生，是吧?
<br> 
<br> ""是啊，我想我跟这家工厂有些关系。你是谁呀?
<br> 
<br> "他伯父回答说，目光如炬地把他仔细端详着。
<br> 
<br> "我叫克莱德。格里菲思。我父亲阿萨。格里菲思，跟您是弟兄吧?
<br> 
<br> "塞缪尔。格里菲思一听有人提到自己这个兄弟……格里菲思家人人都知道他穷愁潦倒……脸上立时笼罩一层阴影。多少年来他没有跟阿萨见过面，如今一提到阿萨，令人不快的兄弟的身影马上映入他眼帘。塞缪尔还清楚地记得最后一次是在佛蒙特州伯特威克附近父亲家里见到他，那时他还是一个年纪跟克莱德相仿的年轻人。不过，两人长得多么不一样啊!
<br> 
<br> 克莱德的父亲，当时既矮又胖，无论体质与智力都很差劲……只会阿谀奉承，而且还有点儿粘粘糊糊。他长着一头鬈发，他那淡蓝色眼睛总是水汪汪的，他的下巴颏儿给人以缺乏坚强意志的印象。可是阿萨这个儿子，长得倒干净利落，很机警。漂亮，显然很懂规矩，头脑也聪明，如同他平时所看到大多数侍应生。不用说，他倒是喜欢他。
<br> 
<br> 塞缪尔。格里菲思与他的长兄艾伦，继承了父亲菲薄财产的一大半。这是因为约瑟夫。格里菲思对自己的小儿子怀有偏见的缘故。塞缪尔。格里菲思历来认为这对阿萨也许是不公道的。因为他们的父亲发现阿萨既不能干，又不聪明，开头想把他赶出去，接着干脆不睬他，最后终于在跟克莱德现下年纪相仿的时候把他逐出了家门。后来，做父亲的将自己的财产(大约三万块美元左右)留给了两个大儿子，由他们平分……而留给阿萨的，就只有区区一千块美元。
<br> 
<br> 正是因为塞缪尔。格里菲思想起了自己的兄弟，现在才十分好奇地直瞅着克莱德。他觉得，克莱德简直一点儿都不象很多年前被逐出父亲家门的小兄弟。
<br> 
<br> 还不如说克莱德更象他自己的儿子吉尔伯特。因为他觉得，他们两人长得非常相象。这时，尽管克莱德心里很害怕，可是塞缪尔对他印象显然很好，认为克莱德居然能在这样时髦的俱乐部里觅到一个位置了。塞缪尔。格里菲思平时所接触到的，仅仅局限于莱柯格斯的活动环境，因而在他看来，联谊俱乐部的性质和地位，确是令人可敬的。侍候这里客人的那些年轻人，通常都是态度谦逊，办事利索。所以，他看见克莱德伫立在他面前，身穿整洁的灰黑相间制服，至少举止风度很出色，因而对他产生了好感。
<br> 
<br> "嘿，你说到哪儿去了!
<br> 
<br> "他很感兴趣地大声说道。"那末，你就是阿萨的儿子!
<br> 
<br> 真是太巧了!
<br> 
<br> 唉，真是怎么也想不到。要知道，我没见到你父亲，没接到他的信，至少有……哦，至少也有二十五六个年头了。最后一次接到他的信时，记得他正住在密执安州大瀑布城那里，要不然就住在这里。我想，现在他不在这里吧。
<br> 
<br> ""是的，他不在这里，先生，"克莱德回答说。他能有回话的机会，心里觉得高兴。"全家都住在丹佛。只有我一个人在这里。""我想，你父母都健在吧。""是的，先生。都健在。""你父亲，他……还在做宗教工作吗?
<br> 
<br> ""哦，是的，先生，"克莱德有点儿迟疑地回答说，因为他至今仍然认为，父亲所从事的宗教工作，在众人心目中，乃是最穷酸。最不中用的。"只不过现在他的那个传道馆，"他接下去说，"附设一家寄宿舍。我看大约有四十多个房间。
<br> 
<br> 他和母亲一块在照管这个寄宿舍和传道馆。""哦，我明白。"他恨不得让伯父留下更好的印象，因此在介绍家里境况时不免有点儿夸大了。
<br> 
<br> "现下他们光景很好，我很高兴，"塞缪尔。格里菲思接下去说，对克莱德衣冠整洁。精力饱满的模样儿印象颇佳。"我想你对眼前这种工作很满意吧?
<br> 
<br> ""哦，还说不上十分满意。不，格里菲思先生，我可不满意，"克莱德马上回答说，深知伯父这一句问话的重要性。"当然罗，收入还不错。不过，我不喜欢这儿赚钱的那种方式，老实说，与我所想象的压根儿不一样。我干上这一行，是因为过去我没有机会去学某一个专门手艺，或是上哪一家公司，在那里才有真正机会得到擢升，使自己成为一个了不起的人物。妈有一次要我给您写信，想问问贵厂有没有什么机会，好让我从头学起，但是我怕您也许会不高兴，因此也就没有写。"他沉默无语，微笑着，不过眼里依然流露出探询的神色。
<br> 
<br> 伯父严峻地瞅着他一会儿，对他的容貌以及他提出这样恳求的方式心里都很满意，于是回答说:
<br> 
<br> "哦，那可很有意思。我觉得你就应该写嘛，要是你心里想……"随后，正如他在所有业务的谈话时常有那种谨慎的习惯，他沉吟不语了。
<br> 
<br> 克莱德觉察到伯父有些踌躇不定了，他在思忖该不该鼓励自己的侄儿。
<br> 
<br> "我猜想贵厂大概没有什么工作能让我做吧?
<br> 
<br> "过了半晌克莱德大胆问道。
<br> 
<br> 塞缪尔。格里菲思只是若有所思地两眼直瞅着他。对这样开门见山地提出要求，他心里虽然喜欢，但也有点儿不喜欢。不过，在他看来，克莱德好象少说也是个很合适的人。看来他很聪明能干，也有很大抱负……很象他自己的儿子;只要他熟悉了产品制造过程，也许他完全可以在他儿子手下当个某某部门的负责人或是助理。不管怎么说，不妨就让他试一试。说真的，不会有什么坏处吧。再说，这毕竟还是他小兄弟阿萨的儿子，他和艾伦大哥也许对他负有某种义务，如果说不是恢复遗产继承权的话。
<br> 
<br> "哦，"他过了半晌说，"这事我得考虑一下。我可一时还说不上有没有合适的工作。我们一开头给你的钱，可不会象这儿那么多哩，"他提醒克莱德说。
<br> 
<br> "哦，那敢情好，"克莱德大声说。一想到他本人有可能在伯父手下任职，不消说，比啥都更让他动心了。"当然罗，在我还没有能耐赚这么多钱以前，我可不会指望那么多的。""再说，你一旦进入了领子业，也许会觉得你并不喜欢它，或者是我们也许会不喜欢你。在这儿顺便说一下，这个行业决不是对每个人都适合的。
<br> 
<br> ""哦，到时候您不妨开除我，那就得了，"克莱德为了让伯父放心才这么说。
<br> 
<br> "不过，打从我一听到您和您那个规模宏大的公司以后，我心里一直在想:
<br> 
<br> 我干这一行是适合的。"这最后一句话，让塞缪尔。格里菲思听了很开心。他本人和他的成就，显然已成为这个年轻人的理想了。
<br> 
<br> "好吧，"他说。"此刻我还没有更多时间来考虑这个问题。不过，反正我在这儿还得待上一两天，让我再想一想。也许我可以帮你一点儿忙。可现在我还说不准，"说罢，他突然回过头去看信了。
<br> 
<br> 克莱德觉得自己在现有情况下已经给他伯父留下了一个尽可能好的印象，因此，也许会有一些结果，于是就一再向他道谢，随后匆匆退了出来。
<br> 
<br> 转天，塞缪尔。格里菲思经过通盘考虑，觉得克莱德以他这般聪明伶俐的劲儿，来厂工作想必也决不会比别人逊色，同时又考虑到自己家里情况以后，就对克莱德说，只要厂里一有什么空缺，他很乐意马上通知他。不过，他还不能保证马上就会有空缺。克莱德必须耐心地等待。
<br> 
<br> 这样，克莱德心里就不时在想，要是伯父厂里可以给他一个职位，不知道多咱才能实现。
<br> 
<br> 就在这时，塞缪尔。格里菲思回到了莱柯格斯，后来跟他儿子商量以后，就决定克莱德应该学点业务，要从最基层，至少……在格里菲思工厂的地下室里先干起来:
<br> 
<br> 制造领子所需用的坯布，都要送到这里下水防缩，凡是真的有志于掌握这一行制造技术的初学者，首先都得被安置在这里，伯父的想法是:
<br> 
<br> 要让克莱德逐步精通这一行业务。而既然要他以一种与莱柯格斯格里菲思家的地位相埒的形式维持自己的生活，便决定一开始就付给他优厚薪金每星期十五块美元。
<br> 
<br> 当然罗，塞缪尔。格里菲思和他儿子吉尔伯特都知道:
<br> 
<br> 这是小小不言的薪金(不是指一般的练习生，而是指克莱德来说的，因为他好歹还是个亲戚)。不过，他们父子俩都很讲究实际，对所有替他们做事的人不是一味仁慈为怀，他们认为:
<br> 
<br> 在本厂初学的人，越是接近生活最低水准就越好。有关资本家剥削的社会主义理论……他们俩谁都觉得不能容忍。他们俩都认为，应该有一些高贵的社会阶层，好让低微的社会阶层渴求逐步得到晋升。社会阶层是断断乎非有不可的。
<br> 
<br> 要是过分照顾了某一个人……哪怕是一个亲戚，那就是愚蠢地破坏了必不可缺的社会标准。要是跟阶级地位。知识水平低下的人在商业上或是在钱财上发生关系，那就必须按照他们所熟悉的标准来对待他们。而最佳标准就是:
<br> 
<br> 要让地位低微的人清晰地认识到这钱来之不易，要让他了解到不管哪一个人，只要从事依他们父子俩观点来看乃是世界上唯一真正重要的建设性的工作……制造物质财富的工作……就必须在构成那一建设性工作的一切细部和一切过程中接受训练，而且还要严格地。有系统地接受训练。懂得以上各点，方可适应一种天地虽然狭小，然而却有节制的生活。这对他们的品格来说也有好处。这将使日后一定会按照社会阶层晋升的人在心灵上和精神上都得到更好的锻炼。至于那些没有能耐，得不到晋升的人，就得让他们依然留在原地不动。
<br> 
<br> 因此，大约一周以后，克莱德的工作性质已经最后确定了，塞缪尔。格里菲思就亲自给在芝加哥的克莱德写信，说如果他有意，可在最近几周内随时前来报到。不过，他必须至少在十天前写信告知行期，以便及时给他作好一切安排。他一到莱柯格斯，应去工厂办公处找吉尔伯特。格里菲思，届时后者会照料他的。
<br> 
<br> 克莱德接到这封信后，简直惊喜若狂，马上给母亲写信，说他真的在伯父那里得到了一个位置，眼下就要动身到莱柯格斯去了。信上还说他准备奋力做去，以便将来真正发迹起来。她给儿子回了一封长信，勉励他对举止和择友两事要特别谨小慎微。象他这样的年轻有为的小伙子之所以误入歧途，其根源就在于交上了坏朋友。他只要能躲开那一伙好色的，或是愚蠢和任性的男孩子和女孩子，一切就相安无事了。象他这样外貌和性格的年轻人，很容易被一个坏女人引入歧途。他在堪萨斯城闯下了什么样的大祸，谅他自己心里有数了。不过，现在他还很年轻，而且正要给那个有钱有势的人做事了，此人只要乐意的话，也许会给他帮大忙呢。信上还说希望他经常写信，向她谈谈自己在那儿努力的成果。
<br> 
<br> 克莱德遵照伯父的话事前通知了他以后，就动身去莱柯格斯了。不过，当初伯父关照他时，并没有说定必须在何时何刻到工厂里去，所以，他一到莱柯格斯，并没有马上就去，而是先找到莱柯格斯独一无二的大旅馆，亦即莱柯格斯大饭店。
<br> 
<br> 他觉得眼下时间还很从容，同时，心中又急于想了解一下他即将在此工作的这个城市是个什么样子，还有伯父在本城的地位又是怎样，因此，他就出去游览市容了。那时，他认为自己一旦报到，开始上班以后，也许马上就不会再有这样的闲情逸致了。于是，他就漫步来到了中央大道……莱柯格斯真正的闹市中心区，有好几条生意兴隆的街道都从这里通过，这些街道，连同中央大道两旁几个街区，组成了一个商业中心……莱柯格斯的交际中心与赏心乐事，也都集中在这里。
