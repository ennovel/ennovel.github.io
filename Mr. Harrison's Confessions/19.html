In a small town such an occurrence is sure to be talked about, and to make a great deal of mischief. When I went home to dinner I was so full of it, and foresaw so clearly that I should need some advocate soon to set the case in its right light, that I determined on making a confidante of good Mrs. Rose. I could not eat. She watched rite tenderly, and sighed when she saw my want of appetite.
<br> 
<br> ‘“I am sure you have something on Your mind, Mr. Harrison. Would it be — would it not be — a relief to impart it to some sympathising friend?”
<br> 
<br> ‘It was just what I wanted to do.
<br> 
<br> ‘“My dear, kind Mrs. Rose”, said I, “I must tell you, if you will listen.”
<br> 
<br> ‘She took up the fire-screen, and held it, as yesterday, between me and her.
<br> 
<br> ‘“The most unfortunate misunderstanding has taken place. Miss Tomkinson thinks that I have been paying attentions to Miss Caroline; when, in fact — may I tell you, Mrs. Rose? — my affections are placed elsewhere. Perhaps you have found it out already?” for indeed I thought I had been too much in love to conceal my attachment to Sophy from any one who knew my movements as well as Mrs. Rose.
<br> 
<br> ‘She hung down her head, and said she believed she had found out my secret.
<br> 
<br> ‘“Then only think how miserably I am situated. If I have any hope — oh, Mrs. Rose, do you think I have any hope — ”
<br> 
<br> ‘She put the hand-screen still more before her face, and after some hesitation she said she thought, “If I persevered — in time — I might have hope.” And then she suddenly got up, and left the room.
