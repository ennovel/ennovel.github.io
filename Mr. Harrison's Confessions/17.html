The servant must have left the folding-doors a little ajar, I think. Mrs. Munton came to call on Mrs. Rose; and the former being deaf, I heard all the speeches of the latter lady, as she was obliged to speak very loud in order to be heard. She began:
<br> 
<br> ‘“This is a great pleasure, Mrs. Munton, so seldom as you are well enough to go out.”
<br> 
<br> ‘Mumble, mumble, mumble, through the door.
<br> 
<br> ‘“Oh, very well, thank you. Take this seat, and then you can admire my new work-table, ma’am; a present from Mr. Harrison.”
<br> 
<br> ‘Mumble, mumble.
<br> 
<br> ‘“Who could have told you, ma’am? Miss Horsman? Oh, yes, I showed it Miss Horsman.”
<br> 
<br> ‘Mumble, mumble.
<br> 
<br> ‘“I don’t quite understand you, ma’am.”
<br> 
<br> ‘Mumble, mumble.
<br> 
<br> ‘“I’m not blushing, I believe. I really am quite in the dark as to what you mean.”
<br> 
<br> ‘Mumble, mumble.
<br> 
<br> ‘“Oh, yes, Mr. Harrison and I are most comfortable together. He reminds me so of my dear Mr. Rose — just as fidgety and anxious in his profession.”
<br> 
<br> ‘Mumble, mumble.
<br> 
<br> ‘“I’m sure you are joking now, ma’am” Then I heard a pretty loud:
<br> 
<br> ‘“Oh, no;” mumble, mumble, mumble, for a long time.
<br> 
<br> ‘“Did he really? Well, I’m sure I don’t know. I should be sorry to think he was doomed to be unfortunate in so serious an affair; but you know my undying regard for the late Mr. Rose.”
<br> 
<br> ‘Another long mumble.
<br> 
<br> ‘“You’re very kind, I’m sure. Mr. Rose always thought more of my happiness than his own” — a little crying — “but the turtle-dove has always been my ideal, ma’am”
<br> 
<br> ‘Mumble, mumble.
<br> 
<br> ‘“No one could have been happier than I. As you say, it is a compliment to matrimony.”
<br> 
<br> ‘Mumble.
<br> 
<br> ‘“Oh, but you must not repeat such a thing! Mr. Harrison would not like it. He can’t bear to have his affairs spoken about.”
<br> 
<br> ‘Then there was a change of subject; an inquiry after some poor person, I imagine. I heard Mrs. Rose say:
<br> 
<br> ‘“She has got a mucous membrane, I’m afraid, ma’am.”
<br> 
<br> ‘A commiserating mumble.
<br> 
<br> ‘“Not always fatal. I believe Mr. Rose knew some cases that lived for years after it was discovered that they had a mucous membrane.” A pause. Then Mrs. Rose spoke in a different tone.
<br> 
<br> ‘“Are you sure, ma’am, there is no mistake about what he said?”
<br> 
<br> ‘Mumble,
<br> 
<br> ‘“Pray don’t be so observant, Mrs. Munton; you find out too much. One can have no little secrets.”
<br> 
<br> ‘The call broke up; and I heard Mrs. Munton say in the passage, “I wish you joy, ma’am, with all my heart. There’s no use denying it; for I’ve seen all along what would happen.”
<br> 
<br> ‘When I went in to dinner, I said to Mrs. Rose:
<br> 
<br> ‘“You’ve had Mrs. Munton here, I think. Did she bring any news?” To my surprise, she bridled and simpered, and replied, “Oh, you must not ask, Mr. Harrison; such foolish reports.”
<br> 
<br> ‘I did not ask, as she seemed to wish me not, and I knew there were silly reports always about. Then I think she was vexed that I did not ask. Altogether she went on so strangely that I could not help looking at her; and then she took up a hand-screen, and held it between me and her. I really felt rather anxious.
<br> 
<br> ‘“Are you not feeling well?” said I innocently.
<br> 
<br> ‘“Oh, thank you, I believe I’m quite well; only the room is rather warm, is it not?”
<br> 
<br> ‘“Let me put the blinds down for you? the sun begins to have a good deal of power.” I drew down the blinds.
<br> 
<br> ‘“You are so attentive, Mr. Harrison. Mr. Rose himself never did more for my little wishes than you do.”
<br> 
<br> ‘“I wish I could do more — I wish I could show you how much I feel” — her kindness to John Brouncker, I was going on to say; but I was just then called out to a patient. Before I went I turned back, and said:
<br> 
<br> ‘“Take care of yourself, my dear Mrs. Rose; you had better rest a little.”
<br> 
<br> ‘“For your sake, I will,” said she tenderly.
<br> 
<br> ‘I did not care for whose sake she did it. Only I really thought she was not quite well, and required rest. I thought she was more affected than usual at tea-time; and could have been angry with her nonsensical ways once or twice, but that I knew the real goodness of her heart. She said she wished she had the power to sweeten my life as she could my tea. I told her what a comfort she had been during my late time of anxiety; and then I stole out to try if I could hear the evening singing at the vicarage, by standing close to the garden-wall.
