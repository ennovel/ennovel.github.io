I did not care for the awkwardness of my situation, which had so perplexed and amused me in the morning. I felt that something was wrong; that Sophy was taken away from me. I sank into despair. If anybody liked to marry me, they might. I was willing to be sacrificed. I did not speak to Mrs. Rose. She wondered at me, and grieved over my coldness, I saw; but I had left off feeling anything. Miss Tomkinson cut me in the street; and it did not break my heart. Sophy was gone away; that was all I cared for. Where had they sent her to? Who was her aunt that she should go and visit her? One day I met Lizzie, who looked as though she had been told not to speak to me; but I could not help doing so.
<br> 
<br> ‘“Have your heard from your sister?” said I.
<br> 
<br> ‘“Yes.”
<br> 
<br> ‘“Where is she? I hope she is well.”
<br> 
<br> ‘“She is at the Leoms” — I was not much wiser. “Oh, yes, she is very well. Fanny says she was at the Assembly last Wednesday, and danced all night with the officers.”
<br> 
<br> ‘I thought I would enter myself a member of the Peace Society at once. She was a little flirt, and a hardhearted creature. I don’t think I wished Lizzie goodbye.
