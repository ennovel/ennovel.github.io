<br> 
<br> ‘“Miss Horsman called after you left,” said she. “Have you heard how John Brouncker is at Highport?”
<br> 
<br> ‘“Very well,” replied I. “I called on his wife just now, and she had just got a letter from him. She had been anxious about him, for she had not heard for a week. However, all’s right now; and she has pretty well enough of work, at Mrs. Munton’s, as her servant is ill. Oh, they’ll do, never fear.”
<br> 
<br> ‘“At Mrs. Munton’s? Oh, that accounts for it, then. She is so deaf, and makes such blunders.
<br> 
<br> ‘“Accounts for what?” said I.
<br> 
<br> ‘“Oh, perhaps I had better not tell you,” hesitated Mrs. Rose.
<br> 
<br> ‘“Yes, tell me at once. I beg your pardon, but I hate mysteries.”
<br> 
<br> ‘“You are so like my poor dear Mr. Rose. He used to speak to me just in that sharp, cross way. It is only that Miss Horsman called. She had been making a collection for John Brouncker’s widow and — ”
<br> 
<br> ‘“But the man’s alive!” said I.
<br> 
<br> ‘“So it seems. But Mrs. Munton had told her that he was dead. And she has got Mr. Morgan’s name down at the head of the list, and Mr. Bullock’s .”
<br> 
<br> ‘Mr. Morgan and I had got into a short, cool way of speaking to each other ever since we had differed so much about the treatment of Brouncker’s arm; and I had heard once or twice of his shakes of the head over John’s case. He would not have spoken against my method for the world, and fancied that he concealed his fears.
<br> 
<br> ‘“Miss Horsman is very ill-natured, I think,” sighed forth Mrs. Rose.
<br> 
<br> ‘I saw that something had been said of which I had not heard, for the mere fact of collecting money for the widow was good-natured, whoever did it; so I asked, quietly, what she had said.
<br> 
<br> ‘“Oh, I don’t know if I should tell you. I only know she made me cry; for I’m not well, and I can’t bear to hear any one that I live with abused.”
<br> 
<br> ‘Come! this was pretty plain.
<br> 
<br> ‘“What did Miss Horsman say of me?” asked I, half laughing, for I knew there was no love lost between us.
<br> 
<br> ‘“Oh, she only said she wondered you could go to sales, and spend your money there, when your ignorance had made Jane Brouncker a widow, and her children fatherless.”
<br> 
<br> ‘“Pooh! pooh! John’s alive, and likely to live as long as you or I, thanks to you, Mrs. Rose.”
<br> 
<br> ‘When my work-table came home, Mrs. Rose was so struck with its beauty and completeness, and I was so much obliged to her for her identification of my interests with hers, and the kindness of her whole conduct about John, that I begged her to accept of it. She seemed very much pleased; and, after a few apologies, she consented to take it, and placed it in the most conspicuous part of the front parlour, where she usually sat. There was a good deal of morning calling in Duncombe after the sale, and during this time the fact of John being alive was established to the conviction of all except Miss Horsman, who, I believe, still doubted. I myself told Mr. Morgan, who immediately went to reclaim his money; saying to me that he was thankful for the information; he was truly glad to hear it; and he shook me warmly by the hand for the first time for a month.
