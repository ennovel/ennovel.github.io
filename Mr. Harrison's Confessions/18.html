As I was leaving his office, feeling full of my riches, I met Miss Horsman. She smiled rather grimly, and said:
<br> 
<br> ‘“Oh, Mr. Harrison, I must congratulate you, I believe. I don’t know whether I ought to have known, but as I do, I must wish you joy. A very nice little sum, too. I always said you would have money.”
<br> 
<br> ‘So she had found out my legacy, had she? Well, it was no secret, and one likes the reputation of being a person of property. Accordingly I smiled, and said I was much obliged to her; and, if I could alter the figures to my liking, she might congratulate me still more.
<br> 
<br> ‘She said, “Oh, Mr. Harrison, you can’t have everything. It would be better the other way, certainly. Money is the great thing, as you’ve found out. The relation died most opportunely, I must say.”
<br> 
<br> ‘“He was no relative,” said I; “only an intimate friend.”
<br> 
<br> ‘“Dear-ah-me! I thought it bad been a brother! Well, at any rate, the legacy is safe.”
<br> 
<br> ‘I wished her good morning, and passed on. Before long I was sent for to Miss Tomkinson’s .
<br> 
<br> ‘Miss Tomkinson sat in severe state to receive me. I went in with an air of ease, because I always felt so uncomfortable.
<br> 
<br> ‘“Is this true that I bear?” asked she, in an inquisitorial manner.
<br> 
<br> ‘I thought she alluded to my five hundred pounds; so I smiled, and said that I believed it was.
<br> 
<br> ‘“Can money be so great an object with you, Mr. Harrison?” she asked again.
<br> 
<br> ‘“I said I had never cared much for money, except as an assistance to any plan of settling in life; and then, as I did not like her severe way of treating the subject, I said that I hoped every one was well; though of course I expected some one was ill, or I should not have been sent for.
<br> 
<br> ‘Miss Tomkinson looked very grave and sad. Then she answered: “Caroline is very poorly — the old palpitations at the heart; but of course that is nothing to you.”.
<br> 
<br> ‘I said I was sorry. She had a weakness there, I knew. Could I see her? I might be able to order something for her.
<br> 
<br> ‘I thought I heard Miss Tomkinson say something in a low voice about my being a heartless deceiver. Then she spoke up. “I was always distrustful of you, Mr. Harrison. I never liked your looks. I begged Caroline again and again not to confide in you. I foresaw how it would end. And now I fear her precious life will be a sacrifice.”
<br> 
<br> ‘I begged her not to distress herself, for in all probability there was very little the matter with her sister. Might I see her?
<br> 
<br> ‘“No!” she said shortly, standing up as if to dismiss me. “There has been too much of this seeing and calling. By my consent, you shall never see her again.”
<br> 
<br> ‘I bowed. I was annoyed, of course. Such a dismissal might injure my practice just when I was most anxious to increase it.
<br> 
<br> ‘“Have you no apology, no excuse to offer?”
<br> 
<br> ‘I said I had done my best; I did not feel that there was any reason to offer ail apology. I wished her good morning. Suddenly she came forwards,
<br> 
<br> ‘“Oh, Mr. Harrison,” said she, “if you have really loved Caroline, do not let a little paltry money make you desert her for another.”
<br> 
<br> ‘I was struck dumb. Loved Miss Caroline! I loved Miss Tomkinson a great deal better, and yet I disliked her. She went on:
<br> 
<br> ‘“I have saved nearly three thousand pounds. If you think you are too poor to marry without money, I will give it all to Caroline. I am strong, and can go on working; but she is weak, and this disappointment will kill her.” She sat down suddenly, and covered her face with her hands. Then she looked up.
<br> 
<br> ‘“You are unwilling, I see. Don’t suppose I would have urged you if it had been for myself; but she has had so much sorrow.” And now she fairly cried aloud. I tried to explain; but she would not listen, but kept saying, “Leave the house, sir! leave the house!” But I would be heard.
<br> 
<br> ‘“I have never had any feeling warmer than respect for Miss Caroline, and I have never shown any different feeling. I never for an instant thought of making her my wife, and she has had no cause in my behaviour to imagine I entertained any such intention.”
<br> 
<br> ‘“This is adding insult to injury,” said she. “Leave the house, sir, this instant!”
