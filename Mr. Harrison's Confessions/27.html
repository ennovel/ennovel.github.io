I spoke rudely to Mrs. Rose, who awaited my return at the door. I rushed past, and locked myself in my room. I could not go to bed.
<br> 
<br> ‘The morning sun came pouring in, and enraged me, as everything did since Mr. Morgan refused. I pulled the blind down so violently that the string broke. What did it signify? The light might come in. What was the sun to me? And then I remembered that that sun might be shining on her — dead.
<br> 
<br> ‘I sat down and covered my face. Mrs. Rose knocked at the door. I opened it. She had never been in bed, and had been crying too.
<br> 
<br> ‘“Mr. Morgan wants to speak to you, sir.”
<br> 
<br> ‘I rushed back for my medicine, and went to him. He stood at the door, pale and anxious.
<br> 
<br> ‘“She’s alive, sir,” said he, “but that’s all. We have sent for Dr. Hamilton. I’m afraid he will not come in time. Do you know, sir, I think we should venture — with Dr. —’s sanction to give her that medicine. It is but a chance; but it is the only one, I’m afraid.” He fairly cried before he had ended.
<br> 
<br> ‘“I’ve got it here,” said I, setting off to walk; but he could not go so fast.
<br> 
<br> ‘“I beg your pardon, sir” said he, “for my abrupt refusal last night.”
<br> 
<br> ‘“Indeed, sir,” said I; “I ought much rather to beg your pardon. I was very violent.”
<br> 
<br> ‘“Oh! never mind! never mind! Will you repeat what Dr. — said?”
<br> 
<br> ‘I did so; and then I asked, with a meekness that astonished myself, if I might not go in and administer it.
<br> 
<br> ‘“No, sir,” said he, “I’m afraid not. I am sure your good heart would not wish to give pain. Besides, it might agitate her, if she has any consciousness before death. In her delirium she has often mentioned your name; and, sir, I’m sure you won’t name it again, as it may, in fact, be considered a professional secret; but I did hear our good Vicar speak a little strongly about you; in fact, sir, I did hear him curse you. You see the mischief it might make in the parish, I’m sure, if this were known.
<br> 
<br> ‘I gave him the medicine, and watched him in, and saw the door shut. I hung about the place all day. Poor and rich all came to inquire. The county people drove up in their carriages — the halt and the lame came on their crutches. Their anxiety did my heart good. Mr. Morgan told me that she slept, and I watched Dr. Hamilton into the house. The night came on. She slept. I watched round the house. I saw the light high up, burning still and steady. Then I saw it moved. It was the crisis, in one way or other.
