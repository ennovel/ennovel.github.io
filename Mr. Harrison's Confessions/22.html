I positively dared not go home; but at length I was obliged to. I had done all I could to console Mr. Morgan, but he refused to he comforted. I went at last. I rang at the bell. I don’t know who opened the door, but I think it was Mrs. Rose. I kept a handkerchief to my face, and, muttering something about having a dreadful toothache, I flew up to my room and bolted the door. I had no candle; but what did that signify. I was safe. I could not sleep; and when I did fall into a sort of doze, it was ten times worse wakening up. I could not remember whether I was engaged or not. If I was engaged, who was the lady? I had always considered myself as rather plain than otherwise; but surely I had made a mistake. Fascinating I certainly must be; but perhaps I was handsome. As soon as day dawned, I got up to ascertain the fact at the looking-glass. Even with the best disposition to be convinced, I could not see any striking beauty in my round face, with an unshaven beard and a nightcap like a fool’s cap at the top. No! I must be content to be plain, but agreeable. All this I tell you in confidence. I would not have my little bit of vanity known for the world. I fell asleep towards morning. I was awakened by a tap at my door. It was Peggy: she put in a hand with a note. I took it.
<br> 
<br> ‘“It is not from Miss Horsman?” said I, half in joke, half in very earnest fright.
<br> 
<br> ‘“No, sir; Mr. Morgan’s man brought it.”
<br> 
<br> ‘I opened it. It ran thus:
<br> 
<br> ‘“MY DEAR SIR, — It is now nearly twenty years since I have had a little relaxation, and I find that my health requires it. I have also the utmost confidence in you, and I am sure this feeling is shared by our patients. I have, therefore, no scruple in putting in execution a hastily-formed plan, and going to Chesterton to catch the early train on my way to Paris. If your accounts are good, I shall remain away probably a fortnight. Direct to Meurice’s . — Yours most truly.
<br> 
<br> J. MORGAN.
<br> 
<br> “P.S. — Perhaps it may be as well not to name where I am gone, especially to Miss Tomkinson.”
<br> 
<br> ‘He had deserted me. He — with only one report — had left me to stand my ground with three.
<br> 
<br> ‘“Mrs. Rose’s kind regards, sir, and it’s nearly nine o’clock. Breakfast has been ready this hour, sir.”
<br> 
<br> ‘“Tell Mrs. Rose I don’t want any breakfast. Or stay” (for I was very hungry), “I will take a cup of tea and some toast up here.”
<br> 
<br> ‘Peggy brought the tray to the door.
<br> 
<br> ‘“I hope you’re not ill, sir?” said she kindly.
<br> 
<br> ‘“Not very, I shall be better when I get into the air.”
<br> 
<br> ‘“Mrs. Rose seems sadly put about,” said she; “she seems so grieved like.”
<br> 
<br> ‘I watched my opportunity, and went out by the side-door in the garden.
