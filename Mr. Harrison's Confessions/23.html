Now I thought that, if I could see Sophy, I would speak to her myself; but I did not wish to encounter the Vicar. I went along the lane at the back of the vicarage, and came suddenly upon Miss Bullock. She coloured, and asked me if I would allow her to speak to me. I could only be resigned; but I thought I could probably set one report at rest by this conversation.
<br> 
<br> ‘She was almost crying.
<br> 
<br> ‘“I must tell you, Mr. Harrison, I have watched you here in order to speak to you. I heard with the greatest regret of papa’s conversation with you yesterday.” She was fairly crying. “I believe Mrs. Bullock finds me in her way, and wants to have me married. It is the only way in which I can account for such a complete misrepresentation as she had told papa. I don’t care for you, in the least, sir. You never paid me any attentions. You’ve been almost rude to me; and I have liked you the better. That’s to say, I never have liked you.”
<br> 
<br> ‘“I am truly glad to hear what you say,” answered I. “Don’t distress yourself. I was sure there was some mistake.”
<br> 
<br> ‘But she cried bitterly.
<br> 
<br> ‘“It is so hard to feel that my marriage — my absence — is desired so earnestly at home. I dread every new acquaintance we form with any gentleman. It is sure to be the beginning of a series of attacks on him, of which everybody must be aware, and to which they may think I am a willing party. But I should not much mind if it were not for the conviction that she wishes me so earnestly away. Oh, my own dear mamma, you would never — ”
<br> 
<br> ‘She cried more than ever. I was truly sorry for her, and had just taken her hand, and began — “My dear Miss Bullock” — when the door in the wall of the vicarage garden opened. It was the Vicar letting out Miss Tomkinson, whose face was all swelled with crying. He saw me; but he did not bow, or make any sign. On the contrary, he looked down as from a severe eminence, and shut the door hastily. I turned to Miss Bullock.
<br> 
<br> ‘“I am afraid the Vicar has been hearing something to my disadvantage from Miss Tomkinson, and it is very awkward” — she finished my sentence — “To have found us here together. Yes; but, as long as we understand that we do not care for each other, it does not signify what people say.”
<br> 
<br> ‘“Oh, but to me it does,” said I. “I may, perhaps, tell you — but do not mention it to a creature — I am attached to Miss Hutton.”
<br> 
<br> ‘“To Sophy! Oh, Mr. Harrison, I am so glad; she is such a sweet creature. Oh, I wish you joy.”
<br> 
<br> ‘“Not yet; I have never spoken about it.”
<br> 
<br> ‘“Oh, but it is certain to happen.” She jumped with a woman’s rapidity to a conclusion. And then she began to praise Sophy. Never was a man yet who did not like to hear the praises of his mistress. I walked by her side; we came past the front of the vicarage together. I looked up, and saw Sophy there, and she saw me.
<br> 
<br> ‘That afternoon she was sent away — sent to visit her aunt ostensibly; in reality, because of the reports of my conduct, which were showered down upon the Vicar, and one of which he saw confirmed by his own eyes.
