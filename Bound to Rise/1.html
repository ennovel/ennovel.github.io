<div>

</div> 
<div>
 The speaker was a woman of middle age, not good-looking in the ordinary acceptation of the term, but nevertheless she looked good. She was dressed with extreme plainness, in a cheap calico; but though cheap, the dress was neat. The children she addressed were six in number, varying in age from twelve to four. The oldest, Harry, the hero of the present story, was a broad-shouldered, sturdy boy, with a frank, open face, resolute, though good-natured.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Father isn't here," said Fanny, the second child.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He'll be in directly. He went to the store, and he may stop as he comes back to milk."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The table was set in the center of the room, covered with a coarse tablecloth. The breakfast provided was hardly of a kind to tempt an epicure. There was a loaf of bread cut into slices, and a dish of boiled potatoes. There was no butter and no meat, for the family were very poor.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The children sat up to the table and began to eat. They were blessed with good appetites, and did not grumble, as the majority of my readers would have done, at the scanty fare. They had not been accustomed to anything better, and their appetites were not pampered by indulgence.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They had scarcely commenced the meal when the father entered. Like his wife, he was coarsely dressed. In personal appearance he resembled his oldest boy. His wife looking up as he entered perceived that he looked troubled.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What is the matter, Hiram?" she asked. "You look as if something had happened."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Nothing has happened yet," he answered; "but I am afraid we are going to lose the cow."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Going to lose the cow!" repeated Mrs. Walton in dismay.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "She is sick. I don't know what's the matter with her."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Perhaps it is only a trifle. She may get over it during the day."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "She may, but I'm afraid she won't. Farmer Henderson's cow was taken just that way last fall, and he couldn't save her."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What are you going to do?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have been to Elihu Perkins, and he's coming over to see what he can do for her. He can save her if anybody can."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The children listened to this conversation, and, young as they were, the elder ones understood the calamity involved in the possible loss of the cow. They had but one, and that was relied upon to furnish milk for the family, and, besides a small amount of butter and cheese, not for home consumption, but for sale at the store in exchange for necessary groceries. The Waltons were too poor to indulge in these luxuries.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The father was a farmer on a small scale; that is, he cultivated ten acres of poor land, out of which he extorted a living for his family, or rather a partial living. Besides this he worked for his neighbors by the day, sometimes as a farm laborer, sometimes at odd jobs of different kinds, for he was a sort of Jack at all trades. But his income, all told, was miserably small, and required the utmost economy and good management on the part of his wife to make it equal to the necessity of a growing family of children.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Hiram Walton was a man of good natural abilities, though of not much education, and after half an hour's conversation with him one would say, unhesitatingly, that he deserved a better fate than his hand-to-hand struggle with poverty. But he was one of those men who, for some unaccountable reason, never get on in the world. They can do a great many things creditably, but do not have the knack of conquering fortune. So Hiram had always been a poor man, and probably always would be poor. He was discontented at times, and often felt the disadvantages of his lot, but he was lacking in energy and ambition, and perhaps this was the chief reason why he did not succeed better.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 After breakfast Elihu Perkins, the "cow doctor," came to the door. He was an old man with iron-gray hair, and always wore steel-bowed spectacles; at least for twenty years nobody in the town could remember ever having seen him without them. It was the general opinion that he wore them during the night. Once when questioned on the subject, he laughingly said that he "couldn't see to go to sleep without his specs".
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, neighbor Walton, so the cow's sick?" he said, opening the outer door without ceremony.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, Elihu, she looks down in the mouth. I hope you can save her."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I kin tell better when I've seen the critter. When you've got through breakfast, we'll go out to the barn."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I've got through now," said Mr. Walton, whose anxiety for the cow had diminished his appetite.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "May I go too, father?" asked Harry, rising from the table.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, if you want to."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The three went out to the small, weather-beaten building which served as a barn for the want of a better. It was small, but still large enough to contain all the crops which Mr. Walton could raise. Probably he could have got more out of the land if he had had means to develop its resources; but it was naturally barren, and needed much more manure than he was able to spread over it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 So the yield to an acre was correspondingly small, and likely, from year to year, to grow smaller rather than larger.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 They opened the small barn door, which led to the part occupied by the cow's stall. The cow was lying down, breathing with difficulty. Elihu Perkins looked at her sharply through his "specs."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What do you think of her, neighbor Perkins?" asked the owner, anxiously.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The cow doctor shifted a piece of tobacco from one cheek to the other, and looked wise.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I think the critter's nigh her end," he said, at last.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Is she so bad as that?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Pears like it. She looks like Farmer Henderson's that died a while ago. I couldn't save her."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Save my cow, if you can. I don't know what I should do without her."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I'll do my best, but you mustn't blame me if I can't bring her round. You see there's this about dumb critters that makes 'em harder to cure than human bein's. They can't tell their symptoms, nor how they feel; and that's why it's harder to be a cow doctor than a doctor for humans. You've got to go by the looks, and looks is deceivin'. If I could only ask the critter how she feels, and where she feels worst, I might have some guide to go by. Not but I've had my luck. There's more'n one of 'em I've saved, if I do say it myself."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I know you can save her if anyone can, Elihu," said Mr. Walton, who appreciated the danger of the cow, and was anxious to have the doctor begin.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, I guess I know about as much about them critters as anybody," said the garrulous old man, who had a proper appreciation of his dignity and attainments as a cow doctor. "I've had as good success as anyone I know on. If I can't cure her, you may call her a gone case. Have you got any hot water in the house?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I'll go in and see."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I'll go, father," said Harry.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, come right back. We have no time to lose."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry appreciated the need of haste as well as his father, and speedily reappeared with a pail of hot water.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That's right, Harry," said his father. "Now you'd better go into the house and do your chores, so as not to be late for school."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry would have liked to remain and watch the steps which were being taken for the recovery of the cow; but he knew he had barely time to do the "chores" referred to before school, and he was far from wishing to be late there. He had an ardent thirst for learning, and, young as he was, ranked first in the district school which he attended. I am not about to present my young hero as a marvel of learning, for he was not so. He had improved what opportunities he had enjoyed, but these were very limited. Since he was nine years of age, his schooling had been for the most part limited to eleven weeks in the year. There was a summer as well as a winter school; but in the summer he only attended irregularly, being needed to work at home. His father could not afford to hire help, and there were many ways in which Harry, though young, could help him. So it happened that Harry, though a tolerably good scholar, was deficient in many respects, on account of the limited nature of his opportunities.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He set to work at once at the chores. First he went to the woodpile and sawed and split a quantity of wood, enough to keep the kitchen stove supplied till he came home again from school in the afternoon. This duty was regularly required of him. His father never touched the saw or the ax, but placed upon Harry the general charge of the fuel department.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 After sawing and splitting what he thought to be sufficient, he carried it into the house by armfuls, and piled it up near the kitchen stove. He next drew several buckets of water from the well, for it was washing day, brought up some vegetables from the cellar to boil for dinner, and then got ready for school.
