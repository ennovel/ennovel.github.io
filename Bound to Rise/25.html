He carried in his hand a carpetbag lent him by Mr. Leavitt, which contained his small stock of under-clothing. His outside suits he left at Mr. Leavitt's, not wishing to be encumbered with them while traveling.</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I see you are on time," said the professor.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, sir; I always mean to be."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That's well; now if you'll jump into my buggy with me, we will ride round to the Town Hall and take in my apparatus. I have to keep a carriage," said the magician, as they rode along. "It saves me a great deal of trouble by making me independent of cars and stages."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The apparatus was transferred to a trunk in the back part of the buggy and securely locked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Now we are all ready," said Professor Henderson,
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Would you like to drive?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, sir," answered Harry, with alacrity.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am going to give an entertainment in Holston this evening," said his new employer. "Were you ever there?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, sir."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is a smart little place and although the population is not large, I always draw a full house."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "How far is it, sir?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "About six miles."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Harry was sorry it was not farther, as he enjoyed driving. His companion leaned back at his ease and talked on various subjects. He paused a moment and Harry was startled by hearing a stifled child's voice just behind him: "Oh, let me out! Don't keep me locked up here!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The reins nearly fell from his hands. He turned and heard the voice apparently proceeding from the trunk.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What's the matter?" asked Professor Henderson.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I thought I heard a child's voice."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "So you did," said the voice again.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The truth flashed upon Harry. His companion was exerting some of his powers as a ventriloquist.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, it is you, sir," he said, smiling.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 His companion smiled.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You are right," he said.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I don't see how you can do it," said Harry.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Practice, my boy."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But practice wouldn't make everybody a ventriloquist, would it?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Most persons might become ventriloquists, though in an unequal degree. I often amuse myself by making use of it for playing practical jokes upon people.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do you see that old lady ahead?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes, sir."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I'll offer her a ride. If she accepts, you'll see sport. I shall make you talk but you must be careful to say nothing yourself."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 A few rods farther on, they overtook an old woman.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Good morning, ma'am" said the professor. "Won't you get in and ride? It's easier riding than walking."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The old women scanned his countenance and answered: "Thank you, sir, I'm obleeged to ye. I don't mind if I do."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 She was assisted into the carriage and sat at one end of the seat, Harry being in the middle.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I was going to see my darter, Nancy," said the old women. "Mrs. Nehemiah Babcock her name is. Mebbe you know her husband."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I don't think I do," said the professor.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He's got a brother in Boston in the dry goods business. Mebbe you've been at his store."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Mebbe I have."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I ginerally call to see my darter--her name is Nancy--once a week; but it's rather hard for me to walk, now I'm getting' on in years."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You're most eighty, ain't you?" appeared to proceed from Harry's mouth. Our hero's face twitched and he had hard work to keep from laughing.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Indeed, I'm not!" said the old lady, indignantly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I'm only sixty-seven and folks say I don't look more'n sixty," and the old lady looked angrily at Harry.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You must excuse him, ma'am," said the professor, soothingly. "He is no judge of a lady's age."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I should think not, indeed."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Indeed, madam, you are very young looking."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The old lady was pacified by this compliment but looked askance at Harry.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Is he your son?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, ma'am."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The old lady sniffed, as if to say, "So much the better for you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Are you travelin' far?" asked the old lady.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What do you want to know for?" Harry appeared to ask.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You're a sassy boy!" exclaimed the old woman.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Harry," said Professor Henderson, gravely, "how often have I told you not to be so unmannerly?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He orter be whipped," said the old lady. "Ef I had a boy that was so sassy, I'd larn him manners!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I'm glad I ain't your boy," Harry appeared to reply.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I declare I won't ride another step if you let him insult me so," said the old woman, glaring at our hero.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Professor Henderson caught her eye and significantly touched his forehead, giving her to understand that Harry was only "half-witted."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You don't say so" she ejaculated, taking the hint at once. "How long's he been so?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Ever since he was born."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Ain't you afraid to have him drive?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, not at all. He understands horses as well as I do."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What's his name?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Before the professor's answer could be heard, Harry appeared to rattle off the extraordinary name: "George Washington Harry Jefferson Ebenezer Popkins."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "My gracious! Has he got all them names?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Why not? What have you got to say about it, old women?" said the same voice.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, I ain't got no objection," said the old woman.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You may have fifty-'leven names ef you want to."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I don't interfere with his names," said the professor.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "If he chooses to call himself--"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "George Washington Harry Jefferson Ebenezer Popkins," repeated the voice, with great volubility.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "If he chooses to call himself by all those names, I'm sure I don't care. How far do you go, ma'am?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "About quarter of a mile farther."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The professor saw that he must proceed to his final joke.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Let me out! Don't keep me locked up here!" said the child's voice, from behind, in a pleading tone.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What's that?" asked the startled old lady.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What's what?" asked the professor, innocently.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "That child that wants to get out."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You must have dreamed it, my good lady."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, there 'tis agin'," said the old lady, excited.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It's in the trunk behind you," said the assumed voice, appearing to proceed from our hero.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "So 'tis," said the old lady, turning halfway round.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, I shall die! Let me out! Let me out!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "He's locked up his little girl in the trunk," Harry seemed to say.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You wicked man, let her out this minute," said the old lady, very much excited. "Don't you know no better than to lock up a child where she can't get no air?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "There is no child in the trunk, I assure you," said Professor Henderson, politely.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Don't you believe him," said Harry's voice.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do let me out, father!" implored the child's voice
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "If you don't open the trunk, I'll have you took up for murder," said the old lady.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I will open it to show you are mistaken."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The professor got over the seat, and, opening the trunk, displayed its contents to the astonished old lady.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I told you that there was no child there," he said; "but you would not believe me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Le' me out," gasped the old woman. "I'd rather walk. I never heerd of such strange goin's on afore."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "If you insist upon it, madam, but I'm sorry to lose your company. Take this with you and read it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 He handed her one of his bills, which she put in her pocket, saying she couldn't see to read it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When they were far enough off to make it safe, Harry gave vent to his mirth, which he had restrained till this at difficulty and laughed long and loud.&nbsp;
