</p><p>Editor:&nbsp;</p><p>Atlas StudiosWang Zhong desperately flapped his energy wings and turned himself into a ball of red and blue light as he escaped from the range of the Ninth Shade Killing Formation. Even though the Formation covered an area of 10 square kilometers, with Lao Wang’s full strength at that moment, he was able to reach its barrier in an instant.He charged forth head-first and wanted to use this massive impact combined with the mixed powers of ice and fire to forcibly charge through the barrier. However, this barrier was not simple either as the rules in this space were fragmented. When he charged into the barrier, it felt as if there was nothing and he was not being blocked. However, when he charged through, he realized that he had charged through the other end of the Ninth Shade Killing Formation barrier and was still within the range of the Formation. The Formation used the shrinking and layering of the spatial laws to design this vicious cycle, like going back to the same place over and over again in an illusion!When Wang Zhong passed through the barrier, the swarm of dim light passed through as well. Lao Wang was dumbfounded for just a moment when the rain of dim light caught up to him!He no longer had the protection of the Hidden Dragon Sword, and the impact of the attack was not something his physical body could forcibly resist. At this moment, he did not care about concealing his strength. Golden light burst forth from Lao Wang’s body as golden runes covered his energy wings and his entire body. His body dazzled with a golden light, and a noble aura filled the air. At the same time, the Hidden Dragon Sword had appeared in his hands.Hua!The Hidden Dragon Sword emitted a dazzling golden light, and all the golden runes shone more brightly. His powers of fire and ice, which were barely able to resist the Ninth Shade Killing Formation, instantly multiplied in strength with the integration of his dragon’s breath. This allowed him to forcibly control the entire space.Closely after, he fiercely swung the Hidden Dragon Sword. It was as if the space he controlled was spurred by a powerful force and was forcibly distorted and twisted.A flash of light burst forth from Lao Wang’s eyes.“Sword Two!”The dim lights that resembled a rain of locusts were damaged and exploded in this distorted space. The thin objects that resembled needles turned into strange faces of various races. They were pulled into various shapes by the distorted space and rapidly exploded with a loud crash! Even the perfectly connected spatial rules on the Ninth Shade barrier produced various crunching sounds as a result of this space-distorting sword technique. It was as if the entire Ninth Shade Killing Formation had been twisted and wrung, destroying the dense spatial rules.Countless pathetic screams and ferocious roars burst forth. Even the Ninth Shade killing aura in his surroundings started to rapidly vanish as a result.Dragon’s breath had a natural resistance against this gloomy aura. If not, even a Gold Core would have prolonged trouble with this.Hu hu hu hu~~~ Wu wu wu wu~~~The spiraling in Wang Zhong’s hand had reached its limit, while the distortion that Sword Two caused in this space had also reached its maximum. He suddenly let go, and the distorted space rebounded. Then, the violent momentum and the chaotic power of the rules that were produced as a result spread throughout.Not only did the boundless rain of dim lights in the air vanish, but even the surrounding barrier was destroyed as a result.However, it was obvious that the Ninth Shade Killing Formation was not that simple. A temporary neutralization of the Formation did not mean that it was destroyed. In the blink of an eye, boundless negative energy rapidly surged from the holes once again.At this moment, Lao Wang did not dare to delay. He had just pierced through the barrier and was outside the boundaries of the barrier. He shot out like an arrow and seized the moment to charge outwards before the negative energy sealed the space once again. He had barely managed to cross the short distance of a few steps after going through dangers time and again when in the next moment, the space was sealed once again. Then, a massive black and gloomy barrier that covered an area of 10 square kilometers appeared in front of Wang Zhong’s eyes. It stretched out to the sky and was like a massive black pillar that emitted boundless gloomy power, causing one to tremble in fear just by looking at it.Lao Wang’s pupils rapidly contracted. If it were not for the special characteristics of the Ninth Shade Killing Formation that he had read about in various resources, and if he did not have the Draconic Spiritual Power that could resist the terrifying gloomy aura from the Ninth Shade Killing Formation, it would have simply been impossible for him to break through and escape from the Ninth Shade Killing Formation, which was extremely well-known in the entire underground world!This was a terrifying formation that even almighty Gold Cores could be trapped by. It was rather extravagant to use this to deal with him.And right now, it was charging towards him!As the race that controlled the release of Celestial Honors Assignments, the Fire Demon Race would definitely know that Wang Zhong had entered the underground world to investigate the incident of the Netherworld King. They would also know that Wang Zhong was definitely at the Dragon’s Head Shore. However, an Earthling had never appeared at the Dragon’s Head Shore and would definitely stick out. With the Fire Demon Race’s understanding of the Heavenly Shell Race, they would definitely be able to guess that the Heavenly Shell Race had bestowed Wang Zhong with an identity that they often used —— the Black Titan!Lao Wang had stayed at the Dragon’s Head Shore for over a month, and only a few Black Titans were there. Thus, it was not difficult at all for the Fire Demons to guess that Old Black was Wang Zhong after having this information.Furthermore, when he recalled the seemingly intentional yet unintentional conversations with Brewwre over the past few days, he had often leaked information regarding the Earthlings to Wang Zhong. This was obviously an attempt to see whether Wang Zhong was interested in information regarding Earthlings. Before this, they might have only been 70% to 80% certain of their guess, but with Lao Wang’s particular focus on the topic of Earthlings, they would definitely be fully certain of it.Furthermore, with the identity and status of the Fire Demon Race in the Star Alliance, if they wanted to contact the Ninth Shade Faction and have them kill someone from the Land, it was not a big deal!The Fire Demon Race…If his opponent was from the Fire Demon Race or the Blood Demon Race, they would definitely have a lot of room to maneuver. They simply understood Wang Zhong too well. Furthermore, with the typical style of the two races, once they decided to make a move against Wang Zhong at this timing, they would definitely not tolerate failure. Even if they were 100% certain of success, they would definitely include two or three more layers of insurance.A thought flashed past his mind. After less than half a second of thinking, Lao Wang could sense the auras of several Solid Core experts appearing from the mines that deployed the Ninth Shade Killing Formation. Even though he was not afraid of this many Solid Cores, they had set up traps and were waiting for him. Only a fool would think of tangling with them now.Go!The figure that charged out from the Ninth Shade Killing Formation only paused in the air for a moment before immediately changing direction and flying towards the Dragon’s Head Shore. With the burst of power in this moment, Wang Zhong’s wings, which had been integrated with his dragon’s breath, could allow him to fly far away from this region with one flap. However, the moment he spread out his wings, an attack rapidly shot at him from behind.Even though he was in his most perfect true form, the terrifying attack still felt life-threatening to Wang Zhong. It came too quickly and with too much power. He had just seen a light flash when the strong wind that the attack kicked up pressed against him from behind, almost causing half his back to collapse.Lao Wang’s pupils rapidly contracted. The speed of his true form was extremely high, but how could it compare to this rapid attack?He did not even dare to charge forth, and he forcibly restrained his wings that had spread out. Then, the power of his dragon’s breath exploded within his true form, and his body suddenly twisted. He had only moved half his body when the terrifying power brushed past his left shoulder. It was a blue ray of light that brought about a powerful scorching sensation. A fiery pain instantly spread from that shoulder.Hurry up and go!Lao Wang did not even acknowledge the injury there. He had focused all his attention on trying to monitor all the movements in his surroundings. Since his opponent was well-prepared, once his ambushers started attacking, they would not stop. The best thing he could do was to leave this place as soon as possible.However, before he could flap his wings, a vast and terrifying feeling descended from above the next second. It contained a harsh aura and instantly shrouded an area of 10 square kilometers while locking onto Wang Zhong’s body. This feeling felt similar to when he had sensed the gaze of the Phoenix God at the phoenix remains in the Mizobudapi World back when he was extremely weak. A pair of massive eyes pierced through the cage that trapped him, as if those eyes were observing a small white mouse.All the distracting thoughts in his mind stopped at this moment, and his spread-out wings were motionless. The hurried expression on his face had also disappeared.Lao Wang hovered in midair and could not move. His expression was grim, but he did not even turn around. This opponent’s control of the situation was too powerful. It was like dynamite whose fuse could be lit at any time. As long as he moved even slightly, it would immediately trigger a chain reaction.An opponent who was able to oppress him to such an extent was definitely a Gold Core expert. Furthermore, it was an enemy who was considered strong even among the Gold Cores and was full of animosity towards him!“You actually allowed a mere Void Core to escape the range of the Ninth Shade Killing Formation. Several dozen years of verifying battle formations was wasted on you damned souls.” A calm voice sounded from behind him. “When we return to our Faction, go to the Punishment Hall and receive 500 strokes of the Dim Spirit Whip. Then, copy the Ninth Shade Battle Formation 5,000 times.”Although this voice was calm, it was extremely majestic and certain.In the distance, seven or eight feeble mosquitoes responded in shame, “”Yes.””His opponent had clearly used his thoughts to firmly lock onto him, exerting boundless pressure on him. However, he could still reprimand his subordinates so casually at the same time. It was obvious that Lao Wang was no more than a distracting thought to him. This person’s strength was simply unimaginable.Wang Zhong continuously accumulated Draconic Spiritual Power, and the golden light on Wang Zhong’s body became even more dazzling. However, he still did not move or turn around. His power had been completely suppressed by his enemy, and his senses were sealed. He simply could not move. If he was going to move, he definitely needed to have 100% certainty that he could rapidly escape. If not, he would definitely encounter a fatal and earth-shattering attack.“Earthling.” The person seemed to have finished reprimanding his disciples and turned towards Wang Zhong. There was faint amusement in his voice. “You can turn around now.”Lao Wang’s body was still completely motionless. His opponent’s voice contained an invisible guiding force that commanded Wang Zhong and controlled the entire battlefield. If he turned around at this moment, he would be at a complete disadvantage regardless of whether it was his power, his body, or even his soul. He would become the prey that would be trampled upon.“You scoundrel who launched a sneak ambush.” Wang Zhong smiled. No matter what, today’s happenings could never lead to a compromise. He would have to fight either way. Who would be polite to him at a time like this? Furthermore, this was the exciting part. “You seem to have a very good impression of yourself.”Wang Zhong’s opponent was not surprised that Wang Zhong was able to resist his command. He had just reprimanded several disciples, but with his vision, he was naturally able to see that there was no problem with his disciples’ control of the formation. It was just that the strength of this Earthling had indeed far exceeded their expectations. However, he never expected that this Earthling’s guts would be greater than his strength for him to dare to talk to a Gold Core expert like this. “I am here. I didn’t launch a sneak attack on you.”“Let’s stop quibbling. You actually set up such a massive formation to deal with a mere Void Core like me. Isn’t this the act of a scoundrel?” While Lao Wang was also known to beat scoundrels in one shot, the strength of this Gold Core was just too overwhelming. If he did not employ strategies or add some variables, he would certainly be dead by the end of the day.“Ha ha ha ha! You have the gift of the gab.” His opponent was slightly dumbfounded but did not seem to mind Wang Zhong’s impoliteness. On the contrary, he had laughed out loud. “You are still young, but you have a lot of guts. Your thoughts are also very deliberate. Even on the brink of death, you still think about using strategies and trying to rile me up. This suits my appetite. Even I can’t help but want to praise you.”The smile on Lao Wang’s face did not change, but his state of mind rapidly sunk, and he could not give a reply. Not only was his opponent powerful, his state of mind was also firm. He did not fall for Lao Wang’s trick and was not even angry at all.“It’s rare to see a junior from the Land who suits my appetite. If I didn’t owe the Blood Demon Race a favor back then, I might have actually let you off.” His opponent laughed and said, “What a pity. Even though you have the natural endowments, you don’t know how to conceal them.”“The Blood Demon Race? Impossible!” Wang Zhong exclaimed.His opponent flashed an obvious expression of disdain. “You are already done for. It’s not a big deal even if you know.”Wang Zhong’s expression did not change, but he felt extremely disgusted on the inside. It seemed like he would have to fight to the death with the Blood Demon Race. When he reached this stage, if he managed to go back alive, he would have to find a way to deal with them.His opponent sensed Wang Zhong’s killing intent but simply laughed calmly. “Heh heh, little fellow, the only thing I don’t like about you is your mouth. However, since I’m bullying someone weaker, I’ll give you the chance to understand on your approaching death. I’ll allow you to launch three attacks. If you can force me to retreat, I will give up and not care about this matter.”“Elder Hades?!” In the darkness, several uncertain voices sounded out. “My ancestors—”From the voices, there was no doubt that they were pure Blood Demons who had hidden themselves extremely well. If they had not spoken at this moment, it might have been difficult for Wang Zhong to even sense their presence.“Silence,” the person calmly said. “Even if your ancestors were here, they would not dare to criticize me. Do you want to die?”As he spoke, the power of the rules started to reverberate throughout. In an instant, the Blood Demons did not dare to say anything. The surroundings were deathly silent.When Gold Cores spoke, the power of the rules would follow!Lao Wang silently thought in his heart that this was the Realm that he had dreamed of. It was like the pleasant voice that Elder Yimo used during lessons. This was not a level that ordinary Gold Core experts would be able to achieve. Thus, it was no wonder that he felt as if he had encountered a powerful enemy just from the oppression by his power. Just what kind of person was Elder Hades?At that moment, he simply felt a wave of killing intent from behind him. This was not the time to be concerned about his opponent’s identity. If he wanted to escape from this situation, he could only rely on his own strength.He was allowed to launch three attacks?His strength was being oppressed. This was his only chance if he wanted to turn this loss into a win. Wang Zhong was already firmly holding his Hidden Dragon Sword in his hand. A golden flickering could faintly be seen on the sword, which was accumulating power and waiting to be unleashed.“Little fellow, you can attack.” That person did not express any opinions and spoke with a casual tone.“As you wish!” Wang Zhong roared and raised the Hidden Dragon Sword in his hand. A wave of golden light shot out, and the accumulated power suddenly burst forth from the sword.“Sword One!”Humm humm humm humm~~~When he launched a full-bodied attack while his true form was active, the might of Sword One would be much more powerful than when he faced Phumetheus. He was able to directly cause this Netherworld aura to sweep across the underground world. Then, golden lights that resembled ripples suddenly spread outwards as if they had materialized and warped the space around them. As a result, resonance was achieved, and a massive trembling sound could be heard!In an instant, the Netherworld River churned, and countless spreading ripples appeared on the calm and vast surface of the River. This produced waves that smashed against the shore, causing Netherworld Water to splash everywhere!The several Solid Core figures who were hiding in the distant darkness could not maintain their balance as the space started to tremble violently. At that moment, the surrounding Netherworld River splashed on them, causing them to tumble out from hiding in panic. They seemed extremely miserable.“You were actually able to rely purely on the power of your sword to affect this world.” An approving look appeared on Elder Hades’s face. Regardless of whether it was the Land or the underground world, ordinary experts were unable to affect the operation of rules in the world due to the existence of the spiritual pressure and gravity. They would have to attain the Gold Core Realm before they were able to borrow the power of the world and achieve such results. However, Wang Zhong was a mere Void Core. “Your sword techniques are considered entry-level, but it’s a pity that they are still too immature. Your mere Void Core Realm foundations will be your fatal flaw.”He smiled. Then, he stretched out his hand and waved his finger.Buzz~ Buzz~ Buzz~ Buzz~This did not involve any rules, only pure spiritual power. Ripples of spiritual power that were visible to the naked eye spread outwards from his fingers.This was a single strike to fell all strikes! Even though the spiritual power ripples did not travel quickly, the space that trembled as a result of Sword One instantly calmed down when it was within the range of the ripples and regained its stability. The might of Sword One was unable to affect these ripples at all. On the contrary, it was neutralized and subdued by his opponent.Even when he had faced Phumetheus, Sword One had given the Fire Demon a great headache. However, at this moment, the shockwaves caused by Sword One had been destroyed as easily as weeds upon contact with his opponent’s spiritual power ripples. Thus, Wang Zhong could not maintain the rhythm of his shockwaves. On the contrary, he frequently lost control as a result of the impact from his opponent’s sound waves! As expected of a Gold Core expert from the underground world that was able to stand on equal footing with the ancestors of the Blood Demon Race. Just this move alone made him much, much more powerful than Phumetheus, who was said to be able to fight against Gold Cores.Wang Zhong was a far cry from moving his opponent’s hair, let alone forcing him to retreat.There was no change in Wang Zhong’s expression, as if he had already expected this. Meanwhile, the might from Sword One had not stopped flowing. He flipped his wrist and twisted the Hidden Dragon Sword.With his dragon’s breath, his explosion of power was extremely powerful. In an instant, the world turned upside down, and heaven and earth went the wrong way. At this moment, the boundless evil aura in his surroundings that tried to strangle Wang Zhong was pulled back by this distorted space, and they lost their objective. The entire world revolved and distorted, as if only Wang Zhong, who was standing in the center of this reversed world, was left standing!“Reversing yin and yang, and turning the world upside down.” Elder Hades’s feet remained motionless. No matter how Wang Zhong warped the space around them, the space that he existed in seemed to be as stable and solid as an iron barricade. The elder did not receive any interference at all. Furthermore, the expression on his face made it seem as if he was admiring a painting that he was extremely interested in. He expressed his pity at a part of the painting that was not beautiful enough. “Your form is as beautiful as a painting, but if you cannot kill, then what use is it?”Ding!He tapped his finger, and waves of black smoke rose from his body and filled the surroundings, as if he was filling a deflated and crumpled balloon with air once again. The space that had been forcibly distorted and folded by Sword Two swelled and bounced back to its original shape in an instant.The spiritual pressure in the surroundings instantly became over ten times more stable with the addition of Elder Hades’s power. Lao Wang simply felt as if the world, which had been operating without any obstacles, had suddenly become rusty and stopped. The entire space was still under the effects of Sword Two, but he was barely able to distort or divide the space. At that moment, the spiritual pressure in his surroundings was so powerful that his bones started to produce a cracking sound. Even his operation of spiritual power started to slow down, let alone be able to use Sword Two!He used all his power to launch Sword One and Sword Two consecutively while he was in his true form, but he was still unable to move his opponent at all. Furthermore, he still had to endure the extremely powerful pressure. An observer might feel earth-shattering despair, but at that moment, Lao Wang’s eyes were as clear as water, and his fighting spirits were high.He knew himself well. Sword One focused on form, while Sword Two focused on the power of the world. They were the ultimate attainment of different techniques, but they were not considered killing techniques of pure power. If he dealt with an opponent whose strength was relative to or weaker than his, these two techniques would naturally be extremely powerful. He would be able to exhibit 200% of his power.However, if he was facing an almighty Gold Core expert who was two Realms higher than him, regardless of whether it was his “form” or his control of the power of the world, his opponent was on a completely different level from him. If he was able to use his weaknesses to attack his opponent’s strengths and display half of his power, it was already considered decent. However, it would not be able to deal with his opponent.These two attacks were no more than appetizers. They served to both paralyze his opponent and warm up to accumulate power.A glint suddenly flashed past Wang Zhong’s eyes. The dragon’s breath that he had fully accumulated within his body instantly surged forth. It burst forth from the Hidden Dragon Sword and turned into sword images that filled the sky! Every single sword image dazzled with a golden light as it emitted its power. They gathered in the sky and instantly lit up the riverbank, making it as bright as day!Sword Three!When he was a Heavenly Soul, his understanding of this technique was only that it was a technique used to attack weak mobs. However, that was only because he did not have enough power and was unable to display the true power of Sword Three. He only achieved the revised and complete version of the Three Sword Techniques in the divine territory, and Sword Three had undergone a quantitative change as a result of the difference in his level of power. The duplication abilities of his divine cells had been completely integrated into Sword Three, and the might of each individual sword image had also strengthened.There were no complex rules or dazzling techniques. This pure form of power simply pursued maximum damage!Hua hua hua~~~ Crash crash crash~~~The sword images that filled the air were as quick as rain, and they went into formation like swarms of locusts. Even the black aura that filled and stabilized this space was completely shattered by these sword images that had been infused with dragon’s breath. Within an area of several square kilometers, even the air became as sharp as blades by this sword attack. Dense sword images formed a wave of attacks that rapidly charged towards Elder Hades!“Oh?!” Elder Hades’s originally relaxed expression was now frozen.Wang Zhong’s earlier two techniques seemed mysterious. However, regardless of whether it was his power or his use of the rules, he was unable to completely escape from the shadows of his Void Core Realm. He did not even have the qualifications to make Elder Hades serious about this battle. However, at this very moment, the power of this technique had suddenly increased by several times!Ordinary people only knew that one would definitely have to rely on their comprehension of the rules and their natural competence in their techniques when up against higher-leveled opponents in order to make up for the difference in raw strength. However, they did not know that the difference in rules and techniques between opponents of different Realms was much greater and harder to overcome than the difference in physical strength and spiritual power!It was already unimaginable that Wang Zhong was able to match his opponent in terms of his comprehension of the rules and techniques. Those who truly had the qualifications to face higher-leveled opponents relied on overbearing power to defeat their opponents. However, this also required massive courage and raw strength that far exceeded one’s imagination!When fighting with an opponent of a higher level, there were no flukes or luck to speak of!This time, Elder Hades did not give any comments as even he had sensed the threat of being injured.He had only planned to casually defend himself against these three attacks but never expected Wang Zhong to be able to reach this stage. Luckily, he had not been too complacent when he spoke and had some room to maneuver.Elder Hades stretched out his left sleeve, and a pitch-black arm that was completely different from his right hand was revealed.The arm was dry and charred, and it resembled a burned tree or a dried branch. However, it contained the boundless power of darkness. When he stretched out his hand, this dark power seemed to block out the countless colors in this world. As a result, all the colors in this world turned extremely dim. At the same time, boundless Netherworld aura surged throughout the entire area.Everyone understood the principles behind mobilizing the power of the world. Any Void Core could easily attempt this level of power in the peripheral worlds. However, in the Land and the underground world, where the spiritual pressure was extremely high, only almighty Gold Cores were able to do so!“Netherworld Ghostly Claws!”The power of the world that filled the skies was boundless and was all for him to use. The darkness in the surroundings all gathered in his hand. Then, he stretched his hand outwards slightly, and the darkness turned into a massive claw! The massive claw had ferocious joints, while its claws were long and sharp. It was extremely massive and faced Wang Zhong’s sword images.Dang dang dang dang dang~~The sword images that were filled with boundless power clashed against the claw like eggs smashing against a rock. There was a series of shattering sounds as the sword images were easily broken by the massive claw. They seemed as weak as glass.“Turn!” Lao Wang’s fighting spirit did not diminish. He tilted the Hidden Dragon Sword in his right hand, while he controlled the sword technique with his left hand. Then, he pointed the tip of his sword.The rain of swords that filled the air instantly split into two halves and avoided the massive claw. They charged to the left and the right of the claw respectively, attempting to slaughter Elder Hades, who was hiding behind the massive claw.Elder Hades clenched his fist, and the massive Netherworld Ghostly Claws swept past the air in both directions at the same time. A majority of the thousands of sword images were instantly shattered by this attack, but there were far too many sword images. Furthermore, Lao Wang was controlling them. About one-quarter of the sword images slipped past the Netherworld Ghostly Claws to charge towards Elder Hades.Elder Hades had made some mistakes in his judgment of this Earthling. As a result, when the Earthling unleashed Sword Three, he was at a loss. Even the Netherworld Ghostly Claws had been materialized in a hurry. At that moment, once he fell short, he would continue to be at a disadvantage. He could no longer use the Netherworld Ghostly Claws to defend himself. Furthermore, as the rules he had imposed restricted even him, he could not even move or dodge.Elder Hades focused his mind, and his right hand rapidly gestured in the air. Then, a runic array that was formed from black flames rapidly appeared in front of him and instantly transformed into a massive protective barrier.Meanwhile, the sword images in the air that had slipped through were within attacking range. They did not seem great in number, but they doubled in the air, then again, and once again! Wang Zhong was willing to burn all his power here. The spiritual power in his entire body accumulated, and his spiritual power and divine cells were rapidly sucked dry. He did not care about the price he had to pay. He definitely had to force his enemy to retreat!Victory and defeat would be decided by this move. Wang Zhong roared with anger, “Kill!”Pa pa pa pa pa pa!Countless sword glints landed on the black protective barrier, and this massive impact forcibly caused the entire barrier to collapse. Elder Hades, who was within the barrier, was forced to retreat by half a body’s length.The sword glint assault did not cease, and Elder Hades felt that he could not help but step back. Divine light burst from his eyes, and bloodthirsty black fangs appeared from his mouth. Then, his eyes turned slightly red.</p> </div> </div> <div class="row turn-page"> <a class="col-xs-2" href="/Battle%20Frenzy/1177.html?v=1662299016179">Previous</a> <a class="col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:center;" href="/Battle%20Frenzy/book.html?v=1662299016179">Table</a> <a class="col-xs-2 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:right;" href="/Battle%20Frenzy/1179.html?v=1662299016180"> Next</a> </div> <hr></div><hr><footer class="container"> <p>© Company 2014</p></footer><amp-lightbox id="searchLightbox" class="-il" layout="nodisplay" on="lightboxOpen:searchInput.focus; lightboxClose:searchTriggerOpen.focus" scrollable="" hidden="hidden"> <div> <div class="-ic" role="button" tabindex="0" on="tap:searchLightbox.close"></div> <div class="-ih"> <div class="-sg -sb" on="tap: searchLightbox.close, AMP.setState({ query: '' }), searchForm.clear" role="button" tabindex="0"> <div class="ap-a-ico -sw"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#close"></use> </svg> </div> </div> <div class="ap-o-search-field"> <form action="#" action-xhr="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/echo" class="-ip" id="searchForm" on="submit:AMP.setState({ query: throttledValue }),searchResult.focus" target="_top"> <amp-autocomplete class="-id" filter="substring" min-characters="1" on="select:AMP.setState({ query: event.value })" submit-on-enter="false" src="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/autosuggest"> <div class="ap-a-ico -im"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#search"></use> </svg> </div> <input id="searchInput" class="-iv" name="q" placeholder="What are you looking for?" on="input-throttled:AMP.setState({ throttledValue: event.value })" required=""> <button class="-ig" type="submit" name="search-submit" disabled="" [disabled]="!throttledValue">Search </button> <div role="listbox"></div> </amp-autocomplete> </form> <div class="empty" [class]="query ?
