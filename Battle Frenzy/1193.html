</p><p>Editor:&nbsp;</p><p>Atlas StudiosSeeing Vladimir’s unchanging face, Julienne’s face showed a trace of satisfaction. The little girl was always easily satisfied and easily distracted by other things. The flattery around her seemed to no longer be as hard to bear as before… En?Julienne’s eyes widened. She seemed to have seen the ice prince’s eyelids move slightly?As an ice corpse puppet, it was absolutely impossible to act on his own without the command of the owner, even for something as simple as raising his eyelids.An immortal ice corpse puppet? Perhaps even the highest-state ice corpse puppet? These were just legends. Even for the once incomparably powerful Xeahs with their many supreme secrets, such legends remained as legends. Allowing the ice corpse to naturally evolve had already allowed the Xeah family to reign supreme across the Extreme Ice World, but just now…Julienne was still suspicious of what she saw, but before she could think more about it, a squeaky voice could be heard.The ice bird flew in quickly from the mouth of the canyon and yelled in panic, “Cuckoo, Cuckoo! There are people from the Machinery Race!”There was first silence in the entire ice valley before an uproar of surprise occurred.It had been a long time since the Ice World had been patronized by the Machinery Race. In fact, the Machinery Race generally did not patronize these types of worlds in the Fourth Dimension. Although they supervised all the civilizations under the Star Alliance and had monstrous authority, it was only limited to those in the Fifth Dimension of the Star Alliance plane, and they had no right to reach out to the origin places of the major civilizations unless it was a special case, such as for an appointment from the Star Alliance.However, even if it was for a new appointment in the Star Alliance, they should have been looking for the big figures in the Ice Pole Faction, the leaders of the various sects. What were they doing in the ice valley where only disciples of the Ice Pole Faction could be found?Most of the disciples of the Ice Pole Faction gathered here were surprised, but Julienne’s face was filled with joy.The Xeah clan was once a powerful force in the Extreme Ice World. They had contact with high-level officials and knew the rules of the Star Alliance. The Machines were obviously messengers from the Star Alliance. To make a messenger of the Star Alliance come to such a small place, there could only be one reason: a disciple’s reputation from the Ice Pole Faction had spread and entered the eyes of the senior officials of the Star Alliance or Heavenly Gates. Were the messengers here to recruit students for the Heavenly Gates?Even Julienne herself found such a reason unbelievable. Although she had a strong rise in the Ice Pole Faction, she should not be so well-known. Not to mention the entire Extreme Ice World, even the Ice Pole Faction were considered to be ants in front of the eyes of giants such as the Star Alliance and Heavenly Gates.How could the giants suddenly take the initiative to notice the rise of a little disciple here? But apart from this reason, she really couldn’t think of any other. At least, she had never violated the laws of the Star Alliance. Furthermore, at her level, even if she wanted to violate any laws, she couldn’t.In any case, she was the owner of this ice valley, and if the Machinery Race sent someone to this ice valley, it must be targeted at her. No matter whether it was something to be happy or worried about, being able to get involved with the Star Alliance meant that she was no longer limited to just being a small disciple in the little Ice Pole Faction. This might be the hope that would allow the Xeah family to rise again.She jumped up from her seat with the ice bird next to her still croaking in panic.“Shut up!” Julienne had forgotten about Vladimir’s eyelid movement just now. Her face was flushed with excitement, and there were anxiety and endless expectations in her heart. However, the noisy bird continued beeping in her ear. “Shut up! If you scream anymore, I will turn you into water and flush you down the toilet bowl!”Just as the voice fell, two figures with gleaming silver light were found standing before them.Sure enough, the two were from the Machinery Race! And looking at their clothes, she was sure that they held a certain status in the Machinery Race.In any case, the Extreme Ice World was a level-6 civilization after all. People from the civilization still had the foresight and knowledge of such things. In the ice valley, everyone knelt in an instant. Facing the envoys of the Star Alliance, even the ancestors of the Extreme Ice World had to take a knee, let alone these disciples.“We greet the envoys,” everyone shouted in unison, including Julienne, who had become nervous in her heart.The two from the Machinery Race didn’t even look at the people who had bowed down in front of them but swept their eyes across the crowd, and then…“The Earth civilization and the Blood Demon Race will be starting a Civilization War, and all who participate in the Civilization War and contribute to the survival of their respective civilizations will be granted amnesty for any crimes they face… Earthling Vladimir, would you like to participate in the war as a representative of the Earth?”Everyone in the ice valley was stunned. Earthling? Vladimir? Who was that? And what was the Civilization War between Earth and the Blood Demons? There were some disciples who had heard of some rumors, but such a battle was an affair in the far-away Star Alliance, which had nothing to do with them. The news of the Civilization War had thus not been widely spread in the Extreme Ice World yet.Although every owner who manipulated an ice corpse puppet could find the puppet’s name from the incomplete memories of its life, they would not, however, have the real names of their puppets declared. Such was the tradition. Thus, people in the Ice Pole Faction only knew of the “Ice Prince” but would not know who Vladimir was. Everyone stared at each other, completely confused at what the Machinery Race was saying.Only Julienne, with bright eyes, looked back in the direction of her Ice Prince subconsciously.One could only see that the stiff body trembled slightly this time, and without any instructions from Julienne, the eyes that looked like frost slowly opened. Under the frosty eyelids, Vladimir’s eyes shone brightly, completely different from the gray eyes of the ordinary ice corpses.“I will fight!” Not only his eyes, but his slightly rickety body also slowly straightened up at this moment!It was as if some kind of seal or some kind of restriction had been removed. Julienne could feel the connection between herself and the corpse puppet being disrupted suddenly.Not only that, a terrifying ice force that had been freed from the seal in his body rolled outwards like a violent wind, instantly blasting dozens of disciples who were kneeling close to him far away.“Those who dare to offend my Earth should be killed without mercy!” Vladimir said coldly.Julienne was stunned. Her puppet had… had resurrected?Not only Julienne, but the moment Vladimir made a sound, the entire ice valley also became quiet in an instant.The “resurrection” of ice corpses was not unprecedented in the history of the Extreme Ice World, but they were almost all abnormalities produced after the failure of refining. They might, at best, retain a little memory and wisdom from their previous lives. However, the current Vladimir did not look like a low-class zombie at all. His demeanor and aura clearly showed that he was a living person!Moreover, when the frozen energy was released, when the heart of ice perfectly merged with his soul from the past…All the overflowing ice power in Vladimir gradually subsided, as if it had never existed, as if the explosion of power in the previous moment was just an illusion. Only the few powerhouses present and Julienne, the former owner of the ice corpse, could faintly feel how huge was the force being gathered and restrained in this “corpse”.Rhode D’s pupils were constantly flickering. This task was requested by him. As a friend, he wanted to give Wang Zhong any help he could, but things had become even more interesting than expected along the way. This Vladimir’s elemental power was not only huge, but also pure and flawless. He seemed like a large “elemental spirit”, as if he was an elemental messenger!Any pure and powerful force was enough to be respected in the Land.“Please.” Rhode D’s voice seemed friendly and close.Vladimir took a step forward, and behind him, Julienne finally recovered from the initial shock.She couldn’t imagine Vladimir coming back to life and even leaving her!“No! You can’t go. You’re mine!” she couldn’t help but shout.Regardless of her family’s glory or its return to greatness, at this moment, she felt that such things did not matter much compared to Vladimir leaving her. She felt distressed, as if someone was taking away her most beloved asset.Vladimir stopped for a moment and slowly turned around. With such a calm look, no one understood his inner thoughts at the moment.Julienne ran over with tears falling down her cheeks. She no longer had the awe-inspiring prestige of the “Senior Sister” of the Ice Pole Faction and started crying like a small child. Actually, she should still be considered one.The Earth gave him his first life, and Julienne gave him his second one. For Vladimir, aside from his sense of belonging to and memory of the “Earth”, all he had left were memories of Julienne.“Then let’s go. We should always be together.” The cold and handsome face was meticulous, but his eyes became gentle as Vladimir stretched out his hand toward Julienne.His soul that had fused with the heart of ice had become pure and flawless, shining with an intoxicating light.Not to mention Julienne, even those kneeling in the ice valley were in awe of Vladimir, no matter male or female.What family glory? What family revival? At this moment, it seemed that they were all erased from Julienne’s mind.Julienne became a little dizzy as she held Vladimir’s outstretched hand dumbly.“Cuckoo, Cuckoo! Me too!” A chirp sounded in the silent ice valley, one that was filled with joy and excitement.……The Mirror World…In a corner forgotten by the world, darkness was the norm here. Killing was the main objective here, and it remained the same even after countless epochs.There had been many rebellions in the Mirror World in history, but their instigators had just been a group of lunatics who changed who they killed. Even the way the problem was solved was very similar. The leader of the rebellion would suddenly die one day, causing the so-called rebellion to naturally dissipate since they were left without a leader.Such darkness repeated day after day, and killings continued year after year.The “rats” hiding in the dark had been watching with cold eyes the current so-called rebel army. In the eyes of these rats, the “rebel” army this time was no different from those in the past. It would only differ in how long they could continue struggling. The Star Alliance would soon send a killer to “solve” this problem. Following them was simply a&nbsp;
</p><p>dead</p><p>&nbsp;end.But at this time, the dark world suddenly ushered in a holy light. This dazzling light seemed to shine straight through the entire world. It was as if a huge light hole opened in the sky, and then there was enough light to illuminate the entire world, spreading the afterglow throughout!This was something the Mirror World had never seen before, or at least, no one had seen it in this era. Only some who had lived in the Mirror World long enough could vaguely guess what it was from some ancient records.This was the holy light, which could dispel the evil and bloodlust from killing and could even make the killing curse of the Mirror World disperse.Countless people who had long been eroded by the killing will and forgotten their names were all at a loss under this holy light. They stared blankly at this light, feeling lost, while some rats that had been deeply poisoned were shivering under it. They then ran to hide in a deeper and darker place where the holy light could not shine upon them. Even their teeth were chattering!The entire peaceful Mirror World boiled up in a moment, and within its depths, there were a group of people who had long been “awake” looking at the place where the holy light was shining from in astonishment.“It’s the Machinery Race!”“Could it be that the Machinery Race has sent out an army to encircle us?”In the huge rebel camp, countless people looked at the light with anger and fear.They had already been forced to such a place by the cruel laws of the Star Alliance and had lived in this bloody world like a dog according to the will of the upper class of the Star Alliance for so many years. Even if they had previously committed a serious crime, the punishment should have long been over, not to mention that the people who were exiled to the Mirror World were often being wronged. It was just that they did not have sufficient power or a strong background to defend themselves, causing them to suffer this injustice for generations. But now, the Star Alliance did not even allow them the little peace they had and had even decided to send the Machinery Race to encircle and kill them?Everyone felt despair and grief at this moment.“Master Buddha! Let’s fight!”“Hahaha! It’s not a loss to have known so many friends before dying!”“I will stay here and fight with them! Master Buddha, please leave quickly. As long as you are still alive, the Resistance Army will not be wiped out!”Mo Wen didn’t say a word but just stood there with his hands behind his back. Although he had closed his eyes, he could still clearly feel the holy light in the distance. Instead of panic, there was a faint smile on his face instead.One could only see two silvery bodies fly out from the light, and the people in the camp who were still very excited and clamoring for a fight just now were all stunned.T—two?The Machinery Race only sent out two people to encircle and kill the Resistance Army? This was…“Prepare to meet the Star Alliance messengers,” Mo Wen said faintly, not raising his volume or making any extra action.The whole camp became quiet immediately. Without a doubt, Mo Wen’s word was considered to be an absolute divine decree here, and everyone would follow it regardless.The two silver silhouettes came swiftly in the direction of the camp. When they first appeared, they were still far away, but with only a few space leaps, the silver silhouettes had reached the top of the base camp.The camp was quiet at this time, and everyone looked coldly at the two from the Machinery Race above.There was absolutely no weak person who managed to stay alive in the Mirror World. An ordinary Void Core from the Land was not comparable to even the most inferior Void Core who managed to survive in the Mirror World. This was a world of killing. Without strength, there was only one dead end.Rhode D and his companion could not help but feel a hint of coldness. To be able to make the Machinery Race feel the coldness, it could be said that the resentment and hostility pervading around them were at an insane level.However, they still felt a hint of surprise. These people in the Mirror World had all been sent here by the Machinery Race. Their hatred towards the Machinery Race could be imagined. But at this time, all the people here were quiet and had managed to suppress their anger towards the Machinery Race, merely watching them quietly. No one was making any noise, and there was even a neat queue…Since when did the vicious convicts in the Mirror World become so tame and orderly?In the end, Rhode D fixed his gaze on a young male and female pair in the middle of the camp.As soon as he saw these two people, Rhode D knew their identities — Mo Wen and Mo Xingchen. These were two people from Earth. To be precise, one of them was under an illusion.Mo Wen lost his disguise under Rhode D’s scanning, but he was not surprised at all. In the Mirror World, Mo Wen had been in total control of the situation, and it could even be said that every step of Mo Wen was part of Mo Xingchen’s careful planning.Rhode D had already met Napier and Vladimir. Seeing Mo Wen did not give him any sense of surprise. He even felt a little… disappointed because he didn’t feel any hidden power in him. The female Earthling was even weaker.But… it was better than nothing. There were too few powerhouses from Earth, so few that even the Void Cores were being sent to the battle. It was said that this Buddha had a powerful magical purification ability. Also, this Mo Xingchen’s actual combat ability might be average, but she could have other ways to help Wang Zhong.These distracting thoughts flashed through Rhode D’s mind, but he didn’t worry about it much. He just kept his gaze on Mo Wen’s face and spoke directly, “The Earth civilization and the Blood Demons have started a Civilization War. According to the laws of the Star Alliance, Mo Wen and Mo Xingchen, both of you will receive amnesty and can leave the Mirror World at any time. If you wish to participate in the Civilization War, you can follow me now.”The camp, which was already quiet, became even more silent at this moment.In this world where even death was a form of liberation, no one cared about this Civilization War or anything else. Everyone could only hear the word “amnesty” ringing in their ears.Amnesty, this was something that everyone in the Mirror World once dreamed of, and it was obviously Mo Wen and Mo Xingchen’s dream once too.Dymas, Musin… Countless pairs of eyes were staring at Mo Wen, and there was fear, and even deep resentment, in their eyes. They had no reason to prevent Master Buddha from leaving here, whether it was because of the amnesty or because of the needs of the Resistance Army. But if Master Buddha really left, what would happen to them?“I would like to participate in the war on behalf of the Earth.” Mo Wen’s expression was calm, without the slightest waver on his face. “It’s just… I want to take my brothers out together with me.”“Brothers?” Rhode D was stunned for a moment.However, Mo Wen looked around at the entire camp. “They have all joined Earth. They only need a copy of the Earth’s official document, and they will all be citizens of Earth. According to the laws of the Star Alliance, during the Civilization War, all citizens will receive amnesty, so these people should have the right to leave here!”After a few seconds of calmness, the originally silent camp exploded in an instant!The camp was full of excitement! The Resistance Army was currently no longer comprised of one or two weaklings. Their numbers had already exceeded a thousand, and the weakest they had was a pinnacle Void Core. They had a large number of Solid Cores as their backbone, and there were even several Gold Cores!Under normal circumstances, it would be extremely hard for someone to make a powerhouse change his or her origin, but in the Mirror World, this was Mo Wen’s Resistance Army!These unruly rebels and wicked people from the Land had suffered from this ever-dayless dark life in the Mirror World day after day. They had all long thrown away their unruliness and so-called ideals. Origin? Where was their origin race when they were exiled here waiting to die?The prison term of the Mirror World was different from other places of exile. All Void Cores who entered the Mirror World had to stay for a hundred years, while Solid Cores had to stay for one era, and Gold Cores had to stay for 10 eras! Even though there was a limit, in fact, no one really managed to survive till the limit came. Usually, there would only be about one in 10,000 people who managed to survive long enough to be released from the Mirror World. Even though Gold Cores were strong, only seven out of 10 could last through the sentence. As for the others…?Originally, all of them thought that in this life, they could only wait to die slowly here. They never expected that there would be such a chance for them to be released!Everyone became excited and felt that Master Buddha did not forget them, just as he had once said when he took them into his arms, “Buddha has a predestined relationship with all of you”. All those who belonged to the Resistance Army were together because of fate!“I am willing to follow Master Buddha until death! I would like to join the Earth civilization!”“Live as an Earthling, die as an Earthling!”There were hundreds of strong Solid Cores and hundreds of Void Cores, and even the few powerful beings who had been silent in the crowd were Gold Cores! Their voices were filled with excitement at this moment, and the terrifying aura combined rocked the world! This was a gathering of masters who had survived countless years of killing in the Mirror World.What a powerful force this was! The feeling that it brought to Rhode D was that this was no less than the power of an ordinary level-7 civilization!Rhode D was shocked. He really never thought that there would be such a situation. He believed that even Arbitrator Wikans who controlled everything, Chief Judge Lyune, and even the completely unpredictable Wang Zhong would have never thought that this could happen, that as Earth was going war with a level-7 civilization, there would be such a huge group of powerful experts willing to join Earth!Yes, according to the laws of the Star Alliance, as long as these people voluntarily joined Earth and it was willing to accept them, the Star Alliance would have no right to interfere with such a matter. Of course, their status was that of an immigrant, and they were not qualified to represent Earth as participating in the Civilization War had another set of rules.Nonetheless, according to the laws of the Star Alliance, as citizens of Earth, they naturally also enjoyed the right of amnesty during the war between civilizations, and there was no problem with them leaving here. Also, how were they considered meaningless even though they could not participate in the Civilization War? With such a huge force, if the Blood Demon Race wanted to really end Earth, they would not be able to avoid a decisive battle with this group of people anyway! And in the face of this group of powerhouses who had managed to survive in the Mirror World, even the Blood Demon clan might not be able to secure victory. Even if Earth was defeated, at least Earth’s descendants were guaranteed to continue their heritage.Rhode D was obviously happy to see such a thing happen. After all, he was on Wang Zhong’s side, but even if they were willing to join Earth, a series of procedures would still need to be completed.After hesitating for a while, Mo Xingchen smiled as if she had guessed it and said, “My lord, the procedure is just a piece of paper. If they are willing to follow, will Earth even refuse them?”“Wait a minute.” Rod D did not refuse. He closed his eyes and muttered. Everyone knew that he was sending messages through the communication network of the Machinery Race.Such a matter actually depended on whether the Machinery Race was willing to help Earth. The procedures could be said to be strict and had to be processed. If they were stuck at this juncture, they could not do anything about it either. However, if they had the aid of the Machinery Race, such a problem would be a simple matter.Everyone was waiting anxiously while Mo Wen remained expressionless. After more than ten minutes, Rhode D suddenly opened his eyes, and with a stiff smile on his face that was unique to the Machinery Race, he announced, “Approved! ”……Two months passed in a flash, and the discussion on the war between the two races had already reached its peak.Today was the day when the Civilization War would begin. The gambling houses across the Land were officially closed this morning, but the results of the betting were astonishing.There were very few people who bought the option of who would win or who would lose. After all, the outcome of this match was too easy to guess, and the odds were also very low to prevent those who wanted to bet on both sides at the same time.Most of them were gambling on how many battles the Blood Demons could win. In a nine-person Civilization War, five victories counted as a win, but if Earth managed to take one or two victories, there would be a need for the battle to continue to its sixth or seventh match. Most people bought the choice where the Blood Demon Race needed six matches to take the win. After all, considering the existence of the Netherworld King Mu Zi and Wang Zhong, there was the possibility of some tough matches being seen. These two were capable of fighting the Blood Demon Race’s Gold Cores, except for the Blood Demon Ancestor.Therefore, the victory of the Blood Demon Race in six matches was the most recognized result in this Civilization War in the Land. Unsurprisingly, there were many, hundreds of thousands of people, who bet on this result. There were after all tens of thousands of races and hundreds of millions of citizens in the entirety of the Land. The pool of gambling money had accumulated to a rather horrifying value after the calculations were done, but the odds were still not high.After all, there were too few people betting on Earth, and there was no corresponding pool of money for those betting on the Blood Demon Race to win. Thus, the odds were naturally pitiful. But just last night, when the gambling market was about to close, when the betting odds for the Earth winning were at their highest, a very large bet was placed on the Earth winning. The odds that had almost fallen to the bottom were instantly directly raised by more than ten percentage points! This was definitely a huge amount of money that could even bankrupt a wealthy group like the Illusion Race. Some party had actually bet on Earth? In the entire Star Alliance, who had such great financial resources and courage?Earth? It was impossible for a mere level-4 civilization to have such a huge amount of funds……Machinery Palace, Teleportation Field…A large number of people flowed in and out. Originally, the application for entering the Machinery Palace was already very demanding, and those who could travel to and from Machinery Palace in the past two days were definitely of a strong background in the Land. A large number of people from high-level civilizations constantly poured out from here, and big figures who were normally rarely seen in the Land appeared one after another.Four or five from the Machinery Race and a few from the Insect Race were on the field; they included Rhode D, Devin D, Rowling J, Wanwan Min, etc… Although they were young, everyone knew that they were all future higher-ups of the Star Alliance.At this moment however, they seemed to be waiting to receive someone. They were definitely not there to receive the higher-ups of level-6 and level-7 civilizations. For the Machinery Race, those people were not qualified to be specially received, nor would they be there for the higher-ups of level-8 civilizations or high-level members of the Star Alliance as there would naturally be a special Machinery Race reception team for them.Rhode D and the others seemed like they were having a private gathering as the combination was strange. There were Insect Race members in the group and even Earthlings who were about to go extinct, in the opinions of some.Who were they waiting for?Suddenly, a special transmission arrived.“To the staff of Teleportation Area Number 281, please be aware that the special teleportation from YH Star Territory is about to arrive. Please prepare for reception.”Loud radio waves sounded, and it seemed the Rhode D group’s guest had finally arrived. They weren’t hosting as an official, but as a friend of Wang Zhong. They were responsible for entertaining those who had never been to the Machinery Palace.“They’re here.” Rhode D and others smiled slightly and walked toward the teleportation platform.Many people around were looking at this group of people, and also at the so-called YH star field teleportation at station No. 281. YH star field? That should be somewhere in a boundary world. What kind of people made this group of future Star Alliance leaders wait so long? Furthermore, the people were from such a backward and unknown place. Many people were curious.The transmission channel was still doing its work, and more than twenty people could be spotted standing inside. Except for a few elders such as Wang Zhanfeng and Aunt Shea, most of them were young people.Standing in the transparent transmission channel, Ma Dong looked at the prosperous and technologically savvy territory with emotion.Earth had indeed become stronger. Thinking of the past, they had to provide a variety of resources with the help of the Star Alliance to establish an ultra-long-distance transmission channel. It would then take tens of days to cross half of the Fifth Dimension. This was the limit of the technology that Earthlings could create, and countless people on Earth were even proud of it.But now, they had only spent a little bit of money to let the Machinery Race specially open a rapid transmission channel. From last night till now, it took less than sixteen hours to arrive at the Machinery Palace. From Earth to here, it was as if they were riding on a railroad track. They teleported over several cities easily, which was absolutely unimaginable on Earth a few years ago.Behind Ma Dong, Emily, Laura, Sharmie, Gui Xinying, and the others were all uncontrollably excited and looked around outside the transmission channel. Even the mature and stable elders, Wang Zhanfeng and Aunt Shea, couldn’t help but feel excited. It was understandable since no matter how high their status was on Earth and how high their prestige, they were ultimately still considered “indigenous folk” who had never seen the greater world out there. This applied even for Ma Dong. Even though he had done deals with the Illusion Race several times, it was still the first time he had come so far out from Earth. This excitement was also a kind of planetary pride and recognition towards Earth. It was inevitable for them to feel excited in their hearts.There were still many people who wanted to come, such as Hymin and Barran, who wanted to witness Wang Zhong’s miracle with their own eyes, and to accompany the rise and fall of the Earth civilization. However, it was a pity that none of them managed to reach the realm of the Heavenly Soul. With just the physique of a Heroic Soul, they would have been unable to survive in the harsh environment of the Land. Even walking out of the teleportation field might cause them to be directly crushed by the terrifying gravity.Of course, the most regrettable thing was that Scarlett didn’t come… Scarlett, who had already stepped into the Heavenly Soul Stage when Lao Wang left Earth, was unable to come to the divine territory, and it had nothing to do with her strength.Looking at the prosperous city under the transmission channel, Ma Dong couldn’t help but remember what Scarlett said to him a few days ago.“Actually, it would be better for him if I didn’t show up.”Although it was only a short sentence, Ma Dong could feel Scarlett’s determination and understood her desire to help.Today’s Wang Zhong was more than strong enough and beyond most people’s reach. However, Scarlett was Wang Zhong’s only flaw. Scarlett being low-key over the years made sense. After Wang Zhong entered the Heavenly Gates, Scarlett resigned her identity as the dean of Tianjing Academy and lived in seclusion in New World City. She was afraid that someone would use her to deal with Wang Zhong.Thus, she could not come to the match, and Ma Dong even moved her a few days ago and completely hid her. Their opponent was the Blood Demon Race. He would never underestimate his opponent as he had lost a lot by doing so in the past. The opponent this time was even a terrifying enemy like the Blood Demon Race… Every flaw had to be choked in the cradle!It took merely a few moments before the teleportation array finished its transmission. The surrounding light shields opened, and while the huge gravity and spiritual pressure enveloped them, a breath of fresh air rushed forward, and several familiar faces appeared in front of everyone.Lan Daier, the once beautiful instructor of the Holy City, was waiting for everyone here with a few people from the Machinery Race and the Insect Race. This was naturally not the time for Lan Daier and everyone to catch up with each other.A representative from the Machinery Race first stepped forward, reached out to Wang Zhanfeng, and said enthusiastically, “Friends from Earth, I welcome you. My name is Rhode D, and I am a good friend of Wang Zhong. I will take you to the Observatory Stage for the Civilization War.”The Machinery Race were not really good at communication, so they did not exchange any polite greetings or words, but the enthusiasm given off by Rhode D could still be felt by everyone.Sure enough, they were Earthlings! There had been all kinds of rumors that the Machinery Race were friends with the Earthlings, but one would not expect a future leader from the Machinery Race to personally come to welcome the visitors from the Earth. Wang Zhong himself was not even in the party! This showed the importance of Earth to the Machinery Race.There was constant whispering around them. Under normal circumstances, many would be filled with envy and hatred for Earth that had chanced upon such a friendship with their immense luck, but today, most people’s faces only held a faint smile, and even a bit of ridicule. Even if they were friends with the Machinery Race, they were still from a civilization that was about to be exterminated today. Why was there a need to be jealous of them?Wang Zhanfeng and the others took a deep breath before saying, “Thank you! Sorry for troubling you!”The Observatory Stage was just a general term. It was not only a place for the Machinery Race to study dimensional astrology, but also a venue for various large-scale competitions and events. The Civilization War was held in the Tianwang Pavilion, which could accommodate hundreds of thousands of people. The 1,000,000-spectator arena could be regarded as the largest one in the entire Star Alliance. It was specially prepared for Civilization Wars and had not been used for nearly an era. However, it was still properly maintained, and the entire stadium looked brand new.Although there were still two or three hours before the Civilization War began, when Rhode D and the others rushed to the Tianwang Pavilion with Wang Zhanfeng and his entourage, it was already crowded with people, and the stadium that could accommodate a million spectators was almost full.The stands were shaking, and all kinds of overwhelming noises were buzzing around. Below was a huge oval arena that encompassed a total of 100,000 square meters. A dense rune structure spread around the edge of the arena. Its lines shone with faint blue fluorescence in the air, which seemed to contain some powerful yet invisible energy coming from the runic arrays. Although transparent, the power of this energy could be felt even from a distance. It was obviously a powerful and unmatched protective rune structure, enough to protect the spectators in the stands against attacks from even strong Gold Cores.“The Blood Demons will win! The level of the civilization determines everything!”“Don’t worry. A Civilization War with such a disparity in strength is simply unprecedented.”“Three years ago, Earth was at the bottom among the level-4 civilizations. In just three years, what guts do they have to challenge the Blood Demons in this Civilization War?”“They were definitely forced to do so. I guess the Earth is already crying on the inside before the match has even started.”“That’s not necessarily true. I heard that Earthlings are fully motivated, and everyone there is filled with unprecedented enthusiasm. They firmly believe that their Wang Zhong is a war god and can challenge all nine of their opponents by himself in this Civilization War.”“There is actually such a naive civilization in the Star Alliance?”“Haha, it’s true. I have a friend who had business dealings with Earth. After all, they had just joined the Star Alliance. The ordinary people there have no idea about the strength of the so-called level-7 civilization. They just blindly worship their “god”, Wang Zhong, and all think that Earth will win. Hahahaha!”“I heard that there was a commotion in the gambling house yesterday? A large amount of funds was injected before the market closed, betting that Earth will win. Only Earthlings would be willing to do this since it’s their last struggle.”“Yesterday, when the odds were raised, the money that entered the market was not small. How could a mere Earth have so much money?”“Who knows? I heard that the one surnamed Wang had made a lot in the Heavenly Gates. Their Mu Zi, the Netherworld King, is also rich in the underground world… It is estimated that the whole Earth must have been mortgaged. I see, Earth is not only going to lose everything, they are also going to be putting immense pressure on their children and descendants for thousands of years to come. They will be crushed to death by the huge debt they will have to repay.”“Hehe, poor, pathetic, and (sigh) really a pitiful race.”“It’s estimated that they will not even win a match today. It will be the fastest Civilization War in history!”“Isn’t the one surnamed Wang known as a talent? Well, he can go eat sh*t today!”As soon as he entered the arena, the murmur of the surrounding people poured into Ma Dong and others’ ears like a tsunami. Although the views and attitudes of the Star Alliance clans on this battle were known for a long time, the voices on the scene and those who were maliciously slandering and ridiculing Earth still made everyone’s face look a little unnatural.To be honest, even though the entire Star Alliance looked down on the Earth, the people of Earth themselves did not have such a “consciousness”, especially this group with Wang Zhanfeng, Shirley, Ma Dong, Emily, Lola, and the others. They were not completely unaware of the strength of the Blood Demon Race and the terrifying might of a level-7 civilization. On the contrary, they had had various in-depth communications with the Star Alliance this year. They were very familiar with the power of the so-called Gold Cores and the Blood Demons, who were known as one of the top level-7 civilizations in the Star Alliance.</p> </div> </div> <div class="row turn-page"> <a class="col-xs-2" href="/Battle%20Frenzy/1192.html?v=1662299016847">Previous</a> <a class="col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:center;" href="/Battle%20Frenzy/book.html?v=1662299016846">Table</a> <a class="col-xs-2 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:right;" href="/Battle%20Frenzy/1194.html?v=1662299016847"> Next</a> </div> <hr></div><hr><footer class="container"> <p>© Company 2014</p></footer><amp-lightbox id="searchLightbox" class="-il" layout="nodisplay" on="lightboxOpen:searchInput.focus; lightboxClose:searchTriggerOpen.focus" scrollable="" hidden="hidden"> <div> <div class="-ic" role="button" tabindex="0" on="tap:searchLightbox.close"></div> <div class="-ih"> <div class="-sg -sb" on="tap: searchLightbox.close, AMP.setState({ query: '' }), searchForm.clear" role="button" tabindex="0"> <div class="ap-a-ico -sw"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#close"></use> </svg> </div> </div> <div class="ap-o-search-field"> <form action="#" action-xhr="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/echo" class="-ip" id="searchForm" on="submit:AMP.setState({ query: throttledValue }),searchResult.focus" target="_top"> <amp-autocomplete class="-id" filter="substring" min-characters="1" on="select:AMP.setState({ query: event.value })" submit-on-enter="false" src="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/autosuggest"> <div class="ap-a-ico -im"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#search"></use> </svg> </div> <input id="searchInput" class="-iv" name="q" placeholder="What are you looking for?" on="input-throttled:AMP.setState({ throttledValue: event.value })" required=""> <button class="-ig" type="submit" name="search-submit" disabled="" [disabled]="!throttledValue">Search </button> <div role="listbox"></div> </amp-autocomplete> </form> <div class="empty" [class]="query ?
