</p><p>Editor:&nbsp;</p><p>Atlas StudiosThe surrounding stands were silent. The Blood Demon Ancestor, who had just summoned the Nine Great Ancestral Souls and gathered 100,000 souls, had seemed to be on top of the world. Even the Six Great Kings of the Star Alliance were forced to defend themselves and enter a passive state. However, such a powerful being was instantly met with failure. He was at the end of his rope with nowhere to go!“The Earthlings…”The Heavenly Shell Superintendent, Elder Tsarlozst, and the other looked at Wang Zhong’s gaze. It was no longer the gaze they used to look upon their juniors. Instead, there was a hint of shock in their eyes. In fact, there was even… reverence!Even they did not have the confidence to face the Blood Demon Ancestor, who controlled the Blood River Diagram, empty-handed. Instead, they would have had to rely on the abilities of their family treasures. Yet this Wang Zhong did not have any heaven-defying artifacts on hand…Furthermore, until now, he was only a Solid Core. However, he had easily eliminated the Blood Demon Ancestor’s Blood River Diagram completely and even drove him to despair, just with his own powers! This strength went beyond the scope that the civilizations in the Land could imagine.They had thought that Mo Wen or Mu Zi would be the limits of the Earthlings. However, compared to Wang Zhong, those two were simply too immature…This was a supreme expert who had truly risen to power. Just Wang Zhong alone was enough to frighten the 10,000 races in the Star Alliance and allow the Earth to stand on equal footing with all the other level-8 civilizations!He was truly the top in the Land!Even the king-leveled bosses on the host’s seats, even with their family treasures on hand, would not consider themselves to be much stronger than the Blood Demon Ancestor. Furthermore, in the face of Wang Zhong, who was able to suppress the Blood Demon Ancestor, none of them could be his opponent!“It’s the end…” Fire Demon Elder Kalidan’s voice was somewhat desolate, but there was also a hint of gratification.He could imagine how dangerous it was back when the entire Fire Demon Race collectively wanted Wang Zhong dead! If Lavel had not overridden all their opposing opinions and if her gift of the Hidden Dragon Sword had not allowed Wang Zhong to let Phumetheus off, they would have truly burned all bridges with him. If they were truly antagonistic to Wang Zhong, then the Blood Demon Race would not only have this headache, but the Fire Demon Race would as well!His words did not just represent the end of the Blood Demon Race, but also some of the strength that the Fire Demon Race had accumulated all these years to fight for superiority with the Heavenly Shell Race!It was obvious that Wang Zhong and the Earth were on the Heavenly Shell Race’s side. Furthermore, with such a powerful Wang Zhong and the great strength of the Earth, one could imagine that the scales of the competition between the two level-8 civilizations would tip in favor of the Heavenly Shell Race. As long as Wang Zhong stood with the Heavenly Shell Race, the Fire Demon Race definitely would not have any chance of winning!Luckily, the Fire Demon Race had Lavel. With the relationship between Lavel and Wang Zhong, as well as the things that she had done for Wang Zhong, this Earthling probably would not become complete enemies with the Fire Demon Race or remember their past grievances. At the same time, since the fight between the Fire Demon Race and the Heavenly Shell Race had not truly reached its climax, they only had to give in to withdraw themselves from this struggle. There was still time…“No, not yet.” There was no movement in Chief Judge Lyune’s eyes. The Machinery Race typically knew some secrets about the various races that others did not know about. They happened to know some things about the Blood Demon Ancestor as well.Meanwhile, the others looked at Chief Judge Lyune with some uncertainty. They simply could not imagine the current Blood Demon Ancestor still having any energy to fight back.“You’ve won.” On the contrary, the Blood Demon Ancestor’s voice was calm at that moment. He stood on Wang Zhong’s chessboard and was motionless, while allowing the spearheads of the surrounding chess pieces to aim at him.Without the Blood River Diagram, his power simply could not match that of a true king-leveled expert, let alone Wang Zhong in front of him.However, he still had other methods. He still had another technique to protect his life!He had to live. As long as he was alive, there would still be a chance!“Let me leave, and everything in the Blood Demon Race will be yours.”“Do you think that I will agree?” Lao Wang smiled. “Even if I agree, do you think that the countless dead souls who have died unjustly in the Blood River Diagram would agree?”The Blood Demon Race had too many blood debts! They had slaughtered hundreds of millions of creatures!Furthermore, Wang Zhong and the Earth civilization were able to reach where they were today because they were not naive. Everyone else could live, but this Blood Demon had to die!“Hey…” The Blood Demon Ancestor’s finger perked slightly. A hazy and cruel expression flashed past his face. “Youngster, they say that one should not be harsh on others. Don’t be so ruthless.”From the Blood Demon Ancestor’s tone, he had no intention of giving in at all. He did not even look pitiful as he was supposed to when asking for mercy. On the contrary, he was very stubborn.Wang Zhong smiled. Since the Blood Demon Ancestor’s tone was full of menace, it meant he definitely still had a way out. However, there was no need for Wang Zhong to be afraid.“It’s your turn,” Lao Wang simply said calmly. “You still have one last move.”“…” There was no emotion on the Blood Demon Ancestor’s face or any response from him. There was only silence, as if he was delaying for time in Wang Zhong’s rule domain.However, at that moment, the Star Alliance elites at the surrounding stands, who had calmed down slightly after much difficulty, had finally recovered from their fear.To be honest, before the Civilization War started, the civilizations in the Star Alliance who supported the Blood Demon Race definitely numbered several hundred, or even several thousand, times that of the civilizations who supported the Earth. However, at that moment, all of the voices instantly stood with the Earth.This was not just because of Wang Zhong’s strength, but also because of the blood on the Blood Demon Ancestor’s hands. A hundred thousand people had died in front of everyone’s eyes with their souls swallowed by the Blood River Diagram, and all the survivors present could have been among them.Their bets? Their money? Their position? Whose side they were on? When faced with the threat and fear of life and death, all these were not worth mentioning. At that moment, everyone only had one desire!“Don’t let him off! This old dog is guilty of the most heinous crimes! This old dog should die ten thousand times!”“Master Wang Zhong! Please kill this old dog! Take revenge for the innocent who have died!”“Blood Demon Old Dog! Don’t give him any pity even until death!”“Shut up!” A glint flashed past the Blood Demon Ancestor’s eyes.He could not move nor escape. When he was on the Heaven and Earth Chessboard, he was restricted by the rules and was simply a chess piece.But he still had his own will. This was enough!A dazzling and blood-red ray of light suddenly shot out from his immobile body and infiltrated all over his skin.After losing the Nine Great Souls, he had completely dried up his Blood River Diagram. At that moment, it was as if some other light dazzled in the blood light that shot out from his body and sucked him dry.“Sacrificing yourself?” Wang Zhong did not want to stall for time, but the rules were the rules. The rules of the Heaven and Earth Chessboard were completely natural. It was not that he could not change the rules at all, but once he changed the rules, the rules would no longer be perfect, and it might not have enough power to completely control the Blood Demon Ancestor. He could only wait for the Blood Demon Ancestor to finish taking his time to decide on a move. “Is that of any use? Even your Nine Great Blood Demon Souls cannot resist my domain, much less you simply being able to sacrifice yourself!”There was some ridicule in Lao Wang’s voice as he wanted to provoke the Blood Demon Ancestor. He could sense that the Blood Demon was not simply planning to have a life and death struggle with Lao Wang, and with his domain, he would know that it was ineffective.“Heh heh… Heh heh heh heh…” The Blood Demon Ancestor still did not respond and simply laughed in a cold and gloomy tone. Closely after, a special domain quietly spread…Unlike the explicitly powerful domains of Wang Zhong, Mo Wen, and Mu Zi, this domain was silent and invisible. It existed in the hearts of people and was a pure spirit domain.Other than the king-leveled experts, as well as Mo Wen and Mu Zi who could control domains, no one else in the surrounding spectator stands could sense the existence and spread of this domain. In fact, they did not even know what exactly the Blood Demon Ancestor had done. However, Wang Zhong’s eyebrows froze.At that moment, Lao Wang was extremely sensitive to the power of domains. Thus, he had sensed it the moment the Blood Demon Ancestor activated the domain.It was a wave of malicious power that was filled with a dark and filthy aura. It wanted to infiltrate and influence his soul.However, even though this power infiltrated his soul extremely quickly, it seemed rather weak, just like an ordinary wave of evil aura. When it infiltrated his soul, before it could cause any destruction, it had been forcibly expelled by Lao Wang’s Draconic Spiritual Power and his rule domain, leaving behind no traces on his body.Was this the Blood Demon Ancestor’s trump card? This was rather…No!Very quickly, Lao Wang sensed that even though the dark power had not corroded him, it was extremely contagious! Furthermore, the route of infection was predetermined!Just like how Lao Wang had used his karmic ties through the communication mirror to find people in the Fifth Dimension, the wave of dark power could also be spread through these karmic ties!Thanks to the communication mirror he had previously used, Lao Wang sensed an extremely massive and invisible network rapidly spreading out through his karmic ties, with himself at the center. Furthermore, the speed of this propagation was simply unthinkable. The moment he drove the dark power out, it had already spread to everyone who had ties with Lao Wang! No, the conditions of this curse were more severe. It was an integration of his karmic ties and his bloodline. More accurately, it spread to all Earthlings who had ties with Lao Wang! It spread to 10… 100… thousands of people at the same time!This was…Lao Wang gazed at the Blood Demon Ancestor, who was standing opposite him.At that moment, the Blood Demon Ancestor had swept away all the haze of defeat and laughed crazily. “You have enjoyed success at a young age, and even I cannot help but admire you. You can be said to be invincible in the Land. But so what? Will you choose to let me live, or choose for both sides to suffer and let the entire Earth follow you to your grave? Everything will only take a single thought!”What was that?Countless people on the spectator stands were dumbfounded when they heard this. A majority of people did not know what exactly the Blood Demon Ancestor had just done. However, in that instant, the moment the Blood Demon Ancestor finished speaking, Wang Zhanfeng, Shirley, Milami, Lan Daier, Laura, and the others at where the Earthlings were sitting suddenly trembled. Their normal skin suddenly turned red, and their entire body turned powerless. They became limp and shivered in their seats, as if they had been struck by some terrifying curse.Not only were they affected, even Napier Mo, Vladimir, Aiolos, and the others currently in the Earth waiting room could not resist the Blood Propagation Curse that had spread through Wang Zhong’s karmic ties. Their skin started to rapidly turn red, and they could barely support themselves, even with the strength of a Gold Core. They simply did not lose all ability to resist immediately like Ma Dong and the others. Only Mu Zi and Mo Wen were unscathed. The two of them were at the level where they could truly control laws. Only the power of the laws could resist this infiltration and resist the Blood Propagation Curse.“Don’t move! Don’t use your spiritual power to resist!” Mu Zi was the quickest to sense this. The aura of the Netherworld King instantly spread out, and he immediately wanted to sever the connection between Aiolos and the Blood Propagation Curse. However, he realized that he did not know where to start.“Buddha will only help those who help themselves, fix!” Mo Wen, who had just awakened, started to chant the name of the Buddha, and the light of the Buddha shone from his body. This was a cleansing power that could heal all diseases in the Mirror World, but at that moment, it was useless on Aiolos and the others.This was the power of a curse. It was abstruse, unfathomable, and invisible. It did not materialize at all, and one could only protect themselves if they had a rule domain of the same level. However, if one wanted to help others to cut off the curse, it would simply be ineffective as the power was of a different attribute and a different domain!“Hu! Hu! Hu!” Napier, Vladimir, and even Aiolos’s breathing became extremely rough and heavy at that moment. One could see that their eyes were filled with blood vessels.“I’m alright for now!” Aiolos’s breathing was thick and heavy. He could feel the Blood Propagation Curse rapidly corroding his soul and trying to take control of his soul and his body. If he had not broken through in the previous battle, he would not have been able to resist the bloodthirsty thoughts in his heart. He was skilled at battling. Thus, he was not adept at dealing with such rules and laws.His situation was considered rather good. Beside him, Vladimir and Napier could only barely suppress the evil thoughts in their hearts and could not speak.Meanwhile, Ma Dong and the others on the spectator stands had lost the ability to control themselves. They trembled and shivered, and their bodies felt feverish and powerless. It was as if they had suddenly turned into ordinary people who had no immunity against diseases and were so weak that they collapsed immediately! They hovered along the boundary of death, and any random germ could drive them to their deaths!“It’s the 10,000 Soul Blood Propagation Curse!” The Heavenly Shell Superintendent’s expression darkened.“This technique… is unblockable.” Elder Tsarlozst gasped. Firstly, the Blood River Diagram had absorbed elite souls from the Star Alliance without scruples. Now, the Blood Demon Ancestor had used such a taboo curse law. That wretched Blood Demon Ancestor!But who could do anything against him? At that moment, the bosses could not help but recall some ancient information about the Blood Demon Race once again.At first, the Blood Demon Race had only been a family branch of the Fire Demon Race and cultivated the orthodox fire element laws. However, this passed on through generations until around ten eras ago when a heaven-defying figure appeared — the Blood Propagation Ancestor that had appeared in the Blood River Diagram. His natural endowments were extremely high, and he was once well-known for a period of time in the Fire Demon Race. However, he was too presumptuous and offended an extremely powerful level-7 civilization at that time. He killed several important elders from that race, and the Fire Demon Race was forced to drive him into exile under pressure from the Star Alliance. Thus, he established the independent Blood Demon Race.Furthermore, the 10,000 Soul Blood Propagation Curse was created by the Blood Propagation Ancestor to take revenge on that level-7 civilization. It was a “rule” method that used a curse as its foundation. This was also the basis upon which the divine artifact, the Blood River Diagram, was refined.Later on, it was often said that sorcerers skilled at curses were able to cause the power of their curses to continue for generations in the bloodline. This could not be explained and sounded extremely terrifying, but in reality, it was simply child’s play compared to the Blood Propagation Ancestor’s 10,000 Soul Blood Propagation Curse. This did not simply curse generations of a bloodline, but the entire civilization!Of course, the price to pay was extremely high. The person who laid the curse had to sacrifice their life and their soul! Back then, the Blood Propagation Ancestor had relied on this technique to simply drive that level-7 civilization to extinction. At the same time, he was sealed by the Blood River Diagram and became a part of it.Destroying a level-7 civilization that was as powerful as the Titan Race with just one’s individual strength was something that many king-leveled experts could not do. This incident had shocked the entire Star Alliance. As a result, the Blood Demon Race, who controlled the Blood River Diagram, assumed a top position and replaced that level-7 civilization as they rapidly rose to power. At the same time, the Blood River Diagram and the Karmic 10,000 Soul Blood Propagation Curse had entered the most taboo blacklist of the Star Alliance!The Blood Demon Race was not punished even after sweeping across the Star Alliance for so many years and causing so many deaths as the Alliance had turned a blind eye to them. Besides the protective umbrella of the Fire Demon Race, a greater reason for their power was because they had the Blood River Diagram and this technique.If one truly provoked this race and drove the Ancestor of the Blood Demon Race to risk his life and take revenge, even a level-8 civilization like the Heavenly Shell Race might have their bloodline severed. After all, the scope and range of this technique was just too broad. Furthermore, there was no way to eliminate this curse. No one could match the Blood Demon Race in terms of curses! Moreover, if only a few top experts who could resist the Blood Propagation Curse remained and the rest of the race died out, it would be no different from the extinction of their race.“Earthling, you don’t have much time to ponder.” The Blood Demon Ancestor’s voice reverberated throughout the arena once again. From his tone of voice, he seemed to have regained some confidence.Yes, he had lost. He had lost in the hands of this bizzare Solid Core Earthling, but the Blood Demon Race would not lose! The 10,000 Soul Blood Propagation Curse of his ancestor was invincible and could curse an entire civilization. Whoever came into contact with this curse would die! If the Earthlings really wanted to eliminate him, then the Earth would perish with him! All that would be left was Wang Zhong, a general without an army. Would he do it?“This is only the beginning. I can still control it, but if the Blood Propagation Curse truly devours the first life, then even I will no longer be able to withdraw the curse!” the Blood Demon Ancestor shouted coldly.Wang Zhong was silent and did not speak, as if he was considering something.“What? Are you observing the state of those Earthlings present?” The Blood Demon Ancestor laughed. “Don’t forget this. Even the weakest Earthlings on the spectator stands are at the Foundational Stage and are better able to resist. But what about your homeworld?“Can you see it? Your adorable homeworld, that tiny Earth.” The Blood Demon Ancestor laughed maniacally. “At this moment, one billion people have mysteriously collapsed on the streets. Their entire bodies are red, and they are extremely bloodthirsty. If there is even a slight hint of instability in my control, they will instantly become a bunch of bloodthirsty demons who have lost their intelligence! Then, they will devour themselves alive!”The arena was silent. Even though there were various angry hooting sounds asking for Wang Zhong to kill the Blood Demon Ancestor, when they understood the power of the Blood Propagation Curse, they collectively fell silent. In the Fifth Dimension, even though the different personalities and different cultures among the races there stood in great numbers, there was one similarity among all of them — nothing could possibly be more important than their own race. That was the origin of each individual! If anyone else present was in Wang Zhong’s shoes, none of them would be willing to kill the Blood Demon Ancestor in exchange for the lives of all their fellow people!Wang Zhong hesitated.The Blood Demon Ancestor was the source of the disaster. If he was not eliminated today, there would be no end of trouble in the future. However, he had no way of eliminating the 10,000 Soul Blood Propagation Curse. If the cost was sacrificing the lives of countless people in the Earth civilization, Wang Zhong would definitely reject it.Could Wang Zhong really wait and watch the Blood Demon Ancestor leave just like that?“Hey, hey, hey. Lao Wang, I said that you’d definitely be no good without me!”Wang Zhong was dumbfounded as he heard a familiar voice sounding in his mind. Closely after, a multicolored ray of light dazzled, and a small figure formed in his mind.He was wearing an ostentatious clown outfit as he stuck out his large and bright red nose. His large eyes were wide open as he stretched out his hand and pinched Lao Wang’s nose.“What are you spacing out for?! I only went to sleep, but why does it seem as if you no longer recognize me? Did you actually forget about me? Hey, hey, hey, you can’t be so heartless, right? Who am I? Shout it out loud for me!”Sim—Simba?!Ever since he came to the Land, Simba had been sleeping for two to three full years. At first, Lao Wang was not used to this, but he gradually became accustomed to this after a long time. However, no matter how he adjusted to it, he could not possibly forget Simba’s smile.This was the inseparable fellow who had always accompanied him for as long as he could remember. This was his dearly loved relative!Over the two to three years of Simba’s slumber, even though Lao Wang lived his days as normal, he was constantly worried. A large part of the reason why he had desperately improved his power was because he hoped to be able to quickly awaken Simba after he became strong enough. He thought that it would be a very fast process, but he never expected that there would be no reaction from Simba when he broke through to the Void Core Realm. When he broke through to the Solid Core Realm, there was still no reaction. As a result, Wang Zhong was almost in despair. He could not see any signs of Simba waking up in the foreseeable future.But now, when he was trapped in a dilemma, Simba had suddenly awakened.Yes!Wang Zhong suddenly realised something.His thoughts had been wrong from the very beginning. What could awaken Simba was not the strength of his spiritual power, but the power of his belief!Just like his battles on Skylink in the past, only the power from his spirit and his soul could be used to replenish Simba and the Fate Roulette. Furthermore, he had saved thousands of elite dead souls in the Land from the Blood River Diagram. These dead souls were not ordinary and were all elites from various great civilizations, with great power and wide connections. They were grateful to Wang Zhong, and their relatives, friends, civilizations, and many associated people were also paying close attention to this battle and had all seen this scene. Thus, they were also extremely grateful towards Wang Zhong, and this gave birth to their belief in him…This wave of power had repelled the Blood Demon Ancestor, strengthened his Heaven and Earth Chessboard, and at the same time, stimulated Simba! This allowed him to come back to life!Lao Wang could not help but feel his heart surge. In fact, he had even forgotten the massive danger that the Earth was facing.He had faced death, darkness, and the so-called solitude. He had been abandoned by the entire world, yet Lao Wang had never cared. All of this was not because he had a strong mindset from a young age, but because he had Simba!The two to three years that Simba had spent sleeping was the first time Lao Wang experienced true loneliness. He was able to wholeheartedly devote himself to cultivation and constantly think about cultivation even when he was eating or sleeping. Rather than saying that this state was because he had made a firm resolution and was forced to do so in order to survive, it was because he was afraid of loneliness and boredom. Without the fellow who nagged at his ear from a young age, his loneliness could truly drive him mad.“Simba!” Lao Wang could not help but shout loudly in his mind. His voice was filled with energy that had accumulated for a long time and was now released.“Wrong!” However, Simba was obviously dissatisfied. He widened his eyes and roared, “I’m the Great Simba! The Handsome Simba! The Intelligent Simba! The Invincible Simba!”“Ha ha ha!” Lao Wang could not help but laugh out loud. “You’re my most beloved Simba!”“Hey! Your words have become so sweet! After not seeing you for a few days, your ingratiation has become much more effective!” Simba nodded his head in satisfaction and was in great spirits. It was as if he was not aware that he had just woken up after a long nap. However, in the next second, he would regret his pretentious actions.Lao Wang gave him a fierce bear hug and rubbed him against his chest. His strong and healthy chest muscles pressed against Simba until his face started to turn purple.“Cough! Cough! Cough! Stop! Stop!” Simba managed to struggle out after much difficulty, and his expression turned dark. “Settle the trouble outside first!”Lao Wang suddenly woke up with a start. He had missed Simba too much and had forgotten what he was here for at this moment. He had forgotten that the Earth was now between life and death and that the Blood Demon Ancestor outside would not wait for him and Simba to talk about the past.It was much better now!Even though it was very unlikely for Simba to be able to help him in battle since a long time ago, he now had one more person to discuss things with. Wang Zhong said in a low voice, “That is the 10,000 Soul Blood Propagation…”“Relax, relax! I know that it is slightly troublesome for you, but to Simba…” Simba waved his hand.Ever since Lao Wang obtained the power of belief and stimulated Simba, he had been awake and naturally knew everything that was happening outside. However, since Lao Wang was involved in a battle for life and death, he was in no hurry to jump out and meet up. “Ha ha ha, there is nothing the great Simba doesn’t know or cannot do! You have to rely on Simba during crucial moments!”As he spoke, he stretched out his hand and touched his chest. “Eh? Where’s my Fate Roulette?”“…” Lao Wang picked up the Fate Roulette, which was hanging high in his sea of consciousness, and passed it to Simba. Simba had never had this item on his body, so how could he obtain it from there?“Cough cough cough… I slept for too long, and I’m in a slight daze… It doesn’t matter! These are all small matters, not a problem at all!” Simba gave a dry cough and confidently received the Fate Roulette. “Not bad, not bad. It has enough energy, enough to make a huge judgment… That’s right, what was my line again?”“…” Lao Wang was speechless. Even though he was already accustomed to Simba’s silly attributes, he knew how heaven-defying the power of the Fate Roulette judgment was. However, this matter concerned the life and death of the Earth. This kind of Simba made him feel slightly worried. “Do I need to do something…?”“No need, no need! There’s no need at all! Just tell that Blood Demon something and that he should wait for his death.” Simba scratched his head and suddenly slapped his thigh. “Ah, my line. I remember now!”He tossed the Fate Roulette in his hands into the sky. The Fate Roulette, which was filled with energy thanks to the power of Wang Zhong’s belief, suddenly dazzled. Then, the black and white world started to rapidly rotate and spin.Black and white were reversed, and the heaven and the earth switched places!“Fate is like a wooden dummy. Let’s kick it to our hearts’ content!” Simba shrieked and kicked at the rotating roulette!“Earthling!” In the arena, the Blood Demon Ancestor roared in a frenzy. He felt threatened as Wang Zhong was being so stubborn. He had not expected this!The 10,000 Soul Blood Propagation Curse had been activated, and no one would be able to eliminate it, even if a true god came! If the Blood Demon Ancestor died and lost control of the Blood Propagation Curse, it would immediately kill off all the Earthlings! How could Wang Zhong allow his entire civilization to accompany him to his grave? This did not make sense. What exactly was he hesitating for?!“I almost can’t control the Blood Propagation Curse! You only have one minute left!” the Blood Demon Ancestor roared loudly. In reality, he had no problems with controlling it for another 10 minutes, but he had to give Wang Zhong more pressure.Finally, he saw the Earthling, who had been hesitating all along, suddenly make a determined expression on his face, as if he had made a decision.The Blood Demon Ancestor silently heaved a sigh of relief. The Earthlings were afraid, but so was he! So what if he killed all the Earthlings? As compared to taking revenge, he desired his survival more.However, the next second, the Blood Demon Ancestor heard a sentence that he did not expect to hear.“End of negotiation.” Wang Zhong’s eyes regained their peace as he smiled. “I have chosen to kill you!”He waved his large hand, and 11 chess pieces charged towards the Blood Demon Ancestor to kill him!He was crazy. This Earthling was crazy!The Blood Demon Ancestor’s pupils suddenly contracted. He could not believe that Wang Zhong would sacrifice the lives of everyone on Earth just to kill him!He had never thought that Wang Zhong’s desire to kill him would be so great. Did Wang Zhong think that he did not have the ability to extinguish the Earth?He reacted and shouted wildly, “Then die! All of you!” Since he was able to become the Ancestor of his race, the Blood Demon Ancestor would never be an indecisive person. If he could not live, then the Earthlings should not think of living either!The Blood River Diagram, which could still be stabilized, exploded at that moment. However, at the same time, the monochrome power of the fate judgment had materialized in the chessboard. The judgment succeeded quickly, focusing the monochrome rays of light that were interlaced in the chessboard world into a ball of scorching white light.It was a holy light!The holy light shone. Then, a wave of massive power surged towards the Blood Demon Ancestor and suppressed him!The Blood Demon Ancestor could feel that the moment his Blood Propagation Curse was illuminated by the holy light, it instantly changed direction.The karmic blood propagation threads connected to the bodies of countless Earthlings recoiled and passed through the Blood Demon Ancestor’s body instead before rapidly spreading to the bodies of all the Blood Demons!What was happening?!The Blood Propagation Curse did not have any flaws and could not be eliminated. This was undeniable. The Ancestor who had created this curse was truly a rare talent, and the might of the Blood Propagation Curse had reached the top of all the laws in the Land. However, this was not a power from the Land, but a power of the natural laws. This was a heartless judgment by the world.The Blood Propagation Curse that had been released needed to belong to someone. Since it did not belong to the Earthlings, then it must belong to the Blood Demon Race.It was rebounding back to him!The Blood Demon Ancestor panicked greatly. This was the first time he sensed the massive threat of death! Furthermore, he could even see that the Earthlings on the spectator stands, who had closed their eyes and were waiting for death, had regained their healthy state and frolicked about. On the contrary, at the Blood Demon Race stands, a sea of blood-red eyes instantly shone.“No! This is impossible!” he blurted out with a face full of disbelief. This was a restricted technique that had extinguished an entire level-7 civilization back then! This was an unbreakable power that the Blood Demon Race had used to threaten countless civilizations for several dozen centuries! But it had been resolved by that Earthling just like that?! He could not imagine this. Even as it rebounded and he was being devoured, he simply could not understand what had happened. In fact, he did not even know what kind of power had defeated him.However, it was a pity that he no longer had the opportunity to explore this secret. This sentence had become his last words in this world.“Ah!!” There was a mournful and miserable roar. Light shone from the tattered Blood River Diagram as if it was reflecting light, and the entire Diagram turned into a whirlpool of bloody aura that firmly pulled the Blood Demon Ancestor’s body in. Then, a twisted soul was extracted from his body and sucked into the whirlpool of bloody aura.Closely after, the entire whirlpool was suddenly drawing itself in and rapidly shrank. In the end, there was only a faint splash, and the whirlpool shrank to nothing. It had turned into a dot and disappeared completely, only leaving behind the stiff and empty shell of the Blood Demon Ancestor that had lost its soul. It stood on the chessboard like an actual chess piece.There was dead silence in the arena…The survivors had all witnessed this unbelievable scene. The Blood Demon Ancestor had used a “forbidden curse” in the Star Alliance, but the results were different from what he had expected.“It’s—it’s over?”Few people could see the actual results. Everything that had happened in the arena was too strange. The Blood Demon Ancestor was still standing there, while the Earthling’s chess pieces stopped their attack.Everyone widened their eyes and watched this, but they could not be sure. The level of this battle had gone beyond the scope that these ordinary spectators could understand. The abstruse power of the rules, as well as the curse that could spread throughout a civilization… Such power could not be observed simply with the naked eye.However, the Earthlings and the Blood Demon Race could sense this!Kakadinme had been clenching his fist on the spectator stands. As long as the Ancestor was alive, and as long as the Blood Propagation Curse still existed, no civilization and no one in the Land could truly punish the Blood Demon Race. Even if they momentarily failed in today’s Civilization War, it would be no more than a loss of some wealth. With the strength of the Blood Demon Race, they would eventually seize back what they had once lost. Furthermore, Shai Lowhe, who had been selected as the heir for the Blood Demon Race behind closed doors, had died. This even made Kakadinme slightly excited. As long as Shai Lowhe was dead, only then would he have the opportunity to catch the eyes of the Ancestor and become the next successor of their race. Thus, perhaps the Blood Demons could not accept the loss of this battle, but this did not include Kakadinme. He had even started to imagine how he would lead the declining Blood Demon Race back to glory!However, all these imaginations ceased at this moment, He sensed a wave of power that mysteriously made him panic descend at this moment. As a result, the blood throughout his body throbbed and burned.He felt that his throat was dry, and the skin all over his body also started to rapidly dry up. In fact, it felt as if his soul had contracted a foul disease, making him instantly feel haggard and powerless. Others might panic or feel confused over this, but he was a member of the Blood Demon Race. Furthermore, he was a genius disciple who was close to the core pillars of the Blood Demon Race. Thus, Kakadinme knew too well what this meant.This was the Ancestor’s Blood Propagation Curse, but it was now on the Blood Demon Race. Had the Blood Propagation Curse rebounded?“Ancestor?! Ancestor?!”At this moment, he felt shock and despair. He forcibly resisted the discomfort throughout his body, looked at the arena, and shouted the Ancestor’s name loudly. However, when he saw the Blood Demon Ancestor, who he looked upon as a deity, there was an even more panic-stricken expression on his face. Closely after, his soul was extracted and broken into pieces. Then, everything completely disappeared in the short span of a few seconds!Meanwhile, standing opposite the Blood Demon Ancestor was an Earthling who was also from the Heavenly Gates and of the same age and batch as Kakadinme. However, he was like a deity as he bathed in a pool of holy light. He was holy and lofty, and could not be assaulted!The panic, as well as the anxious and fearful thoughts, in Kakadinme’s heart instantly disappeared, leaving only deep despair.That Earthling, that Wang Zhong… He had killed the Blood Demon Ancestor and even broke the 10,000 Soul Blood Propagation Curse that their Race had relied on as their foundation! This was something that no one in the entire Star Alliance had ever done in over ten eras, and this Earthling had only cultivated for 20 to 30 years…He had wanted to strive against such a being back in the Heavenly Gates?How ridiculous, woeful, and regrettable!Lofty aspirations and high ideals? The revitalization of the Blood Demon Race? In this moment, all of these had lost their significance. He had been struck by the Blood Propagation Curse, and the caster was no longer around. As a result, the curse had lost control, and no one could save the Blood Demon Race. They would definitely lose, and everything would be for nothing.Kakadinme’s eyes turned red, and he felt that he was no longer able to resist the onslaught of the curse. Meanwhile, the skin of the several fellow Blood Demons beside him had started to ulcerate, and dirty blood surged forth from their bodies. Their entire bodies were bright red and extremely itchy. Soon after, they lost their last remaining bits of intelligence and consciousness. They furiously scratched their skin, accelerating the speed at which their body ulcerated…The Blood Demon Race was done for!Kakadinme closed his eyes. The losers would always be in the wrong. He could no longer bear to see the miserable state his fellow Blood Demons were in. He seized the last hint of self-consciousness he had to stretch out his hand and simply smash his own head into pieces…The uproar among the Blood Demons at the spectator stands only lasted for a dozen seconds. Once the Blood Propagation Curse took effect, it was simply too terrifying. The destruction of an entire civilization would occur in no more than an instant. The remaining Gold Core Blood Demons in the waiting room rushed out with red eyes. Even though almighty Gold Core experts were also unable to resist the onslaught of this terrifying curse, their powerful souls and wills, as well as their Gold Core physical bodies, allowed them to resist for a while longer. They wanted to fight for their lives! Even if they died, they would drag in a few Earthlings as scapegoats. Thus, they simply rushed towards the stands where Ma Dong and the others were.To these almighty Gold Core experts, crossing the short distance of a few hundred meters would take no more than the blink of an eye. However, at that moment, it was as if there was a natural moat. The monochrome chessboard world covered the entire arena, including them.Lao Wang did not do anything. He only quietly watched the monochrome chessboard extending infinitely. The five remaining great Gold Cores from the Blood Demon Race simply felt the ground beneath their feet rapidly growing expansively. It was clearly a distance they could clear in one stride, but the more they ran in that direction, the further they felt their destination was.Thirty seconds! Even the few almighty Gold Core experts could not resist for more than thirty seconds.Their festering skin had melted, along with their entire body, turning their bodies into a puddle of foul blood. In the end, this blood dripped on the ground and continuously formed bean-sized blood bubbles that resembled hypertoxic sulphuric acid that melted their bones at the same time.</p> </div> </div> <div class="row turn-page"> <a class="col-xs-2" href="/Battle%20Frenzy/1226.html?v=1662299027805">Previous</a> <a class="col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:center;" href="/Battle%20Frenzy/book.html?v=1662299027805">Table</a> <a class="col-xs-2 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:right;" href="/Battle%20Frenzy/1228.html?v=1662299027806"> Next</a> </div> <hr></div><hr><footer class="container"> <p>© Company 2014</p></footer><amp-lightbox id="searchLightbox" class="-il" layout="nodisplay" on="lightboxOpen:searchInput.focus; lightboxClose:searchTriggerOpen.focus" scrollable="" hidden="hidden"> <div> <div class="-ic" role="button" tabindex="0" on="tap:searchLightbox.close"></div> <div class="-ih"> <div class="-sg -sb" on="tap: searchLightbox.close, AMP.setState({ query: '' }), searchForm.clear" role="button" tabindex="0"> <div class="ap-a-ico -sw"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#close"></use> </svg> </div> </div> <div class="ap-o-search-field"> <form action="#" action-xhr="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/echo" class="-ip" id="searchForm" on="submit:AMP.setState({ query: throttledValue }),searchResult.focus" target="_top"> <amp-autocomplete class="-id" filter="substring" min-characters="1" on="select:AMP.setState({ query: event.value })" submit-on-enter="false" src="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/autosuggest"> <div class="ap-a-ico -im"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#search"></use> </svg> </div> <input id="searchInput" class="-iv" name="q" placeholder="What are you looking for?" on="input-throttled:AMP.setState({ throttledValue: event.value })" required=""> <button class="-ig" type="submit" name="search-submit" disabled="" [disabled]="!throttledValue">Search </button> <div role="listbox"></div> </amp-autocomplete> </form> <div class="empty" [class]="query ?
