</p><p>Editor:&nbsp;</p><p>Atlas Studios“Natural endowments like these are too rare. No wonder it’s said that Earth was once the Playground of the Gods. Could they be the descendants of the deities who visited Earth?”“Speaking of which, I just remembered something. Doesn’t Wang Zhong from the Heavenly Gates have water and fire abilities? Aiolos has lightning abilities, and now, this Napier…”“Damn, could it be that the Earthlings have affinity with four elements?” It was not strange for one or two freaks to emerge from a civilization. For example, practitioners that had affinity with the wind element or the fire element had appeared in races without them. However, their level of affinity was relatively low, as if a beautiful mistake had occurred after they had taken the wrong path. It was difficult for them to achieve normal standards and almost impossible for them to achieve high levels of affinity. They would be considered “deformed people” that the races looked down upon or abandoned. They were simply unable to reach the levels that these Earthlings had achieved.If these Earthlings were able to reach such levels, there was no doubt that this was a natural endowment of their race!This was too powerful. Such natural spatial endowments were something everyone had dreamed of having. When one controlled such abilities, where could they not go in the Land? They could disappear and appear at will without leaving behind any signs or weaknesses, preventing people from tracking them. This was simply invincible!However, this fellow only had this ability, and it seemed as if it could only be used for escaping. His heaven-defying natural endowments in spatial travel did not provide him with any attack abilities. With his realm as a minor Gold Core, when faced with an expert like Carloze, he might not even be able to break through Carloze’s defenses.After a brief shock, boredom started to rise in the audience.It looked like this would be an extended fight that would continue for a very long time. Unless Carloze had some way to force the clown out from the space he was traveling through, would this battle end in a draw? This was obviously not a result that the Earthlings could accept.However, before these people could finish processing this thought, the continuously charging Carloze had stopped. Meanwhile, the entire range of the arena behind him had been enshrouded in the shadows of his red aura.“That’s…?”“It’s a symbol— it’s a formation!” Someone had discovered his method.Skilled equipment refinery practitioners were adept at runic arrays. As an exceptional practitioner from the Blood Demon Race in this aspect, this was definitely Carloze’s specialty. Speaking of which, this was also the most adept and most orthodox combat method in the Blood Demon Race. They used their powerful true forms as their main source of combat power and supplemented it with runic arrays during combat.“Open!” He raised his left hand slightly. Closely after, he closed his fingers, “Form!”At that moment, the seemingly scattered and twisted traces of aura suddenly connected and stretched out under his control. It was pulled straight like threads, forming a dense red network that spread throughout the entire arena. Waves of powerful aura enshrouded the arena, forming a heavenly net that covered the entire battlefield.Buzz~~The moment the heavenly net was formed, a faint buzzing sound could be heard. The spectators could see several threads on the heavenly net trembling for no reason. Meanwhile, Carloze did not even look at them. Instead, he stretched out his five fingers towards the trembling threads.Hua~~The entire heavenly net was activated and wrapped around the trembling area.The spectators could see a humanoid figure continuously struggling in that void. Then, the figure gradually appeared among the layers of threads. It was Napier Mo, who had been hiding throughout the arena.At that moment, Napier Mo seemed to be in a very difficult position, and his clown nose was being forced into a slant to the side by the heavenly net.The spectators could see that the clown was very angry and very disheartened. His legs continuously kicked in random directions, but the more he kicked, the tighter the heavenly net became. In the short span of three to five seconds, Napier Mo was firmly trapped like a large glutinous rice dumpling.Carloze had simply captured the clown alive. It had been too easy.There was no expression on Carloze’s face as everything was under his control. Napier had achieved perfect mastery in his control and comprehension of spatial travel, and was considered a rather rare expert among the assassins. A different Gold Core might have actually died by his hands or, at the very least, been dragged into a fight without a clear winner. However, it was a pity that he had encountered Carloze. The Earthlings had wasted a good battle.“Keep.” Carloze stretched out his left hand, and the heavenly net on the ground, which had forced Napier into a ball, simply flew towards him. Upon closer inspection, the spectators realized that this was not completely condensed out of spiritual power. Instead, it seemed more like a piece of equipment that actually existed. It dazzled with a bewitching and realistic red light.He truly was not willing to believe that all Earthlings had undying bodies!At that moment, the surrounding spectator stands were solemnly silent. This battle was simply far too peaceful compared to the battle between Aiolos and Napier. The two participants did not make any physical contact throughout, nor did they fight each other head-on. Napier possessed an escape ability that was enough for everyone to admire, but who would have thought that he would suddenly be captured alive?At that moment, many spectators had not finished changing their stance on this battle. However, a mysterious glint of amusement flashed past Napier’s eyes at that moment even though he had just been captured alive and was “panic-stricken”. He was now very close to Carloze. Furthermore, the Blood Demon had actively captured him, and he now seemed defenseless.This was a god-given opportunity!A white light suddenly dazzled from Napier’s trapped body. Slowly after, it was as if his entire body had instantly collapsed and shrunk into a white spot. After a brief pause, the white point exploded, and a dazzling white light instantly enshrouded the entire arena.Boom!They were clown clones!The splendid and dazzling light instantly turned the entire world into a vast expense of white. Not only were their expressions and sounds distorted, many spectators even felt that their hearing had been stripped away, as if everything that existed in this world had been distorted in this instant. It was as if the significance of their existence had been deprived by the explosion of this soul. There was not only a vast expense of white before their eyes, but an extreme silence in their ears.This was a soul explosion.The power of any attack that involved a soul body could not be calculated according to normal rules. After all, this was damage on another level, and it was of no use no matter how powerful one’s physical defenses were. Furthermore, in reality, this was the most commonly seen combat technique seen in most examples of the weak defeating the strong in the Land. When one was one Realm away, there was no doubt that using soul attacks was the most effective method. Moreover, looking at the power the clown had produced when his clones exploded, at such a close distance, ordinary Gold Cores might suffer severe injuries if they did not die.At the same time, a hand stretched out from the dark space at the same time as the explosion.The explosion of his soul clones that were enough to frighten the entire arena was no more than a distraction. If this seemingly impressive Gold Core expert was killed so easily, then it would have been a waste of Napier’s fighting spirit.This was just a cover-up. The actual killer was the assassin hiding in the shadows!There did not seem to be anything in the hand, but it seemed to be holding a dagger. The moment the hand waved, even the space in front of it seemed to have been ripped apart.It was a dimensional blade!It was invisible, but it was unusually sharp and could even cut through space!The space had split apart. The silent cracks in the space were like a torn scroll that rapidly stretched from the position where the dimensional blade had appeared towards where Carloze was standing.Die!A glint flashed past Napier’s pupils. He had used this technique to kill several Gold Cores as it was simple but effective. The sharpness of the dimensional blade was not something material objects could resist, and he had accurately aimed at Carloze’s neck! This seemed to be an instant action, but every step had gone through precise calculations, including the distance traveled, as well as Napier’s reaction and dodging position! However, it was a pity…The moment Napier passed through this space and waved his dimensional blade, he did not see the back of Carloze’s neck, but a face looking straight at him.Was Napier in too much of a rush? Had Carloze not been disrupted by the soul explosion of the clones?It did not matter now.From the very beginning, Carloze stood in the center of the explosion while remaining calm and composed. He did not even move by half a step!The explosive power that was enough to change the expressions of countless people in the surrounding stands was no more than a mere firework to him. He did not even bat an eyelid.As one of the commanders of the Blood Demon Race in the outside territories, he did not rely on any combat strategies or commands. Instead, he relied on his powerful strength and his terrifying combat power!Earlier, the Earthling Aiolos was said to have an undying body. However, in Carloze’s eyes, Aiolos was continually injured and continually restored his health. How could this be considered an undying body? At the very best, he was no more than an amusing gecko that could regenerate its tail when it was cut off.Actual undying bodies were powerful! They had powerful defenses that surpassed everything else, and nothing in this world could injure them at all. Only then did one have the qualifications to be called an undying soldier!For example, he was different from other Blood Demon Race experts and even most of the almighty Gold Cores in the Land. Other almighty Gold Cores continually researched various laws, as well as heaven and earth, in order to control the power of the world and the laws. It seemed as if they could become true experts only if they did this. However, Carloze did not think this way. He did not understand the natural endowments behind such abstruse things. Instead, he simply had stubborn willpower that surpassed all else.He had never understood what laws were. To him, all of those were unfounded things that he did not understand. Only his physical body was real, could be seen, and could be touched! Thus, he only focused on refining his body.Furthermore, just by relying on his terrifying willpower and unique natural endowments, he had already achieved great results by following this path. He became an extremely rare almighty Gold Core expert in the Land who did not do research on laws and simply relied on his physical body. Regardless of whether it was in the strength of his attacks, his power, or his defenses, if he was second, no one in the Blood Demon Race would dare to say that they were first. Even the Blood Demon ancestors did not dare to say so!This mere explosive power was simply a firecracker in Carloze’s eyes. Furthermore, it was a firecracker for three-year-olds to play with and was not worth mentioning!Pa!Napier’s hand that was swinging the dimensional blade suddenly stopped in midair as it was lightly grasped by Carloze’s fingers. Closely after, there was a slight pull, and a wave of massive force that could not be resisted simply pulled the clown out from the spatial layer. Meanwhile, the space that was cut through by the dimensional blade rapidly went back to normal at that moment. It was as if nothing had happened in the surroundings at all, only a clown whose right hand was being gripped tightly. He was like a chick that was being picked up and could not resist at all.“I caught you.”A smile appeared on Carloze’s face. It was not that he did not have the ability to chase Napier in the dimensional layers. Instead, he was most frustrated by having to play a game of chase with such weaklings. Instead of chasing him, why would he not just wait for the clown to look for him?But closely after…Crack crack crack crack…In an instant, there was also a change in Napier’s gaze as he was under Carloze’s control. His lips curled upward slightly, and his entire body produced a trembling sound.Voom voom voom voom~~Soul transfer!Boom!Once again, a scorching white light dazzled from Napier’s body even as he was trapped…More clones?The traces of the clown vanished once again.The surrounding spectators were stunned. This clown was simply like a ghost. Putting aside the fact that he could appear and disappear mysteriously, he did not even seem to have a true body! He could escape like this? He was simply an undying bug! Who could deal with this clown?The surroundings were quiet, but Carloze had furrowed his eyebrows. He did not pay attention to the explosive power as it was useless against him no matter how close it was. However, he was very annoyed with this kind of enemy!Hiding and concealing, while playing around with such messy and useless tricks against him… Had the Earthling escaped to the spatial layers again? Did the clown think that he was very free to play house with a three-year-old?“Blood Demon Concealing Armor, Spatial Prohibition Method!”He shouted coldly. Then, the dazzling armor on his body reacted and instantly fell from his body.Pa pa pa pa~~The armor was like a living thing and transformed into countless dazzling fragments with runes on them. Then, they instantly formed a large array on the ground.It was the Blood Demon Concealing Armor, a set of Combat Rune Armor!There would occasionally be two or three people on the stands who knew what was what. The eyes of these people lit up, and they started to drool profusely.The armor could activate runes by itself and could disperse itself into artifacts that had the ability to change shape at will. This was a legendary skill among equipment practitioners, and the armor was a peak piece of work produced when the artifacts in the Land were at their most prominent!Such items were considered rare items even among the level-8 civilizations. However, no one had thought that Carloze possessed such an item.Yes, with the strength of his physical body, he did not even need any defensive equipment. Even though the Combat Rune Armor had the appearance of a set of armor, it was obviously not a defensive weapon. Instead, it was a functional piece of equipment. In particular, it was adept at tracing and breaking through various fabrications! Carloze did not know how many hidden experts he had uncovered by relying on this item.Humm humm humm humm~~~The massive Combat Rune Armor runic array on the ground instantly dazzled the moment it was laid out and pulled on the space in this area, causing the space to tremble.Carloze was half-kneeling on the ground and channeled surging spiritual power from his left hand as he pressed it against the ground. This powerful spiritual power became the source of activation that instantly stimulated the power of the runic array to the highest level.Rumble!!The ground was trembling!The red lines of the runic array instantly spread throughout the entire arena. Closely after, there was a flash of red light as if there was a nuclear fission happening. Massive energy was absorbed through the massive runic array before a shockwave exploded out. This process was too fast.Rumble~~~ Bang bang~~~The entire arena shook violently, and surging spiritual power crashed into the surrounding walls. Not only did the protective barrier shake, but even the space in the arena was shaken and ripped apart by this violent tremor.Puff puff puff puff~~Countless clowns fell from the spatial crack at the same time!One, two, three, four… Clowns fell from the spatial crack like dumplings. However, these clowns did not seem panic-stricken from being forced out of the spatial gap by Carloze. On the contrary, they were all doing their own things.Their poses were all different. Some were doing acrobatics, while some were playing with hula hoops. Some were rubbing their eyes and wailing loudly, while others were dancing and laughing with joy. At that moment, the arena that was full of killing intent was filled with more and more clowns. This was simply an absurd farce!There were too many of them. So many!Carloze would not have been surprised if there were only eight to ten of them. After all, many races in the Land were skilled at soul clones. However, eight to ten clones were usually their limit. But look at this scene! There were over one thousand of such clones!Carloze guessed that perhaps this clown would have many clones, but he never thought that there would be so many! Were there 1,000 clones? What cloning technique in the Land could reach such levels?None, none at all! If one wanted to do this, there was only one answer. This was an illusion! All of these were fake!It was even the kind that he hated the most…Carloze was very strong. He was a dignified and almighty Gold Core expert, and a purely physical Gold Core expert, which was rare even in the entire Land. Thus, his practical combat level was definitely terrifying. As a result, he was never afraid of anyone who dared to ambush him from behind or stabbed him. In fact, he even liked this feeling. He liked anyone who wanted to face him head-on. However, the only kind of enemy he hated was those who hid in the darkness and played tricks and illusions on him, as he was not skilled at such techniques…If he could easily use laws, then why would he have gone through such great troubles and proven himself purely through his physical body, which was 10,000 times more difficult than researching laws! Of course, there would also be no need to spend large amounts of money to repair this Combat Armor that he had obtained from an ancient battlefield and that only served supplementary functions. He had invested in it as he was most lacking in this aspect.“Blood Demon Concealing Armor, Break Formation!”Carloze’s voice was already full of anger. This was the first time he was forced to use his Combat Armor twice when faced with a mere Gold Core who had just advanced! Even though the Combat Armor he had obtained from an ancient battlefield was good, replenishing its energy was very troublesome. He could not activate the armor by simply using the Gold Star Stones that were currently in circulation in the Star Alliance. Instead, he had to collect some ancient energy, which was extremely inconvenient.The Combat Armor, whose fragments spread on the ground and formed a runic array, instantly activated. It was as if it had transformed naturally. In less than half a second, a new runic array had been laid out. It dazzled with golden light and contained the aura of the ancient Dragon Race. This was the most practical technique to break through all hazy illusions!This was an inheritance and a technique from the ancient times. The Combat Rune Armor was unparalleled!“Break!”He channeled his spiritual power. Then there was a brilliant golden light that instantly enshrouded the world and cleansed everything!The countless clowns in the surroundings disappeared, and the original appearance of the arena appeared in front of his eyes. As a result, Carloze’s dark expression relaxed slightly. However, before he could completely relax, an even stranger thing had appeared.He saw that clown standing in front of him.No. More accurately, this was no longer the clown from just now.This fellow was as tall and as strong as him. In fact, even the level of his spiritual power was similar! Layers of light that had been blessed by the laws dazzled on his copper skin. This was something that only almighty Gold Core experts who had forcibly proved themselves with their physical body could achieve!This clown, this assassin, was actually an almighty Gold Core who proved himself with his physical body just like Carloze?Carloze’s first reaction was that this was impossible!Very few people in the entire Land were able to use their physical bodies to prove themselves as almighty Gold Core experts, and all of them were famous boss-leveled beings in their respective large civilizations. How could one become a lowly killer in the underground world with such strength? Furthermore, this was not an issue of rarity or identity. Anyone who was able to use their physical bodies to prove themselves as almighty Gold Core experts were all battle maniacs who loved to fight. Furthermore, they would definitely have the heart to always fight others head-on. If not, what did they cultivate their bodies for? Wasn’t it to fight a satisfying fight?! How could they be like the clown in front of him and hide everywhere!However, if this was fake and yet another illusion… Yet, the formation-breaking array he had set up using his Combat Armor still existed on the battlefield. Furthermore, it continuously dazzled with a golden light that contained dragon’s breath. Anything that was illusory would be revealed in the face of this golden light. How could it possibly be fake?Boom!Before Carloze could finish thinking about this brain-frying question, Napier’s fist had smashed into him.His burly arms did not seem to have gone beyond the range of an ordinary person, and his techniques also seemed rather ordinary. However, the violent power simply pushed Carloze, who was several dozen meters away, back by half a step.A glint flashed past Carloze’s eyes, and he clenched his right hand. Then, a wave of violent power surged forth, as if it had risen from a furnace. His entire fist instantly turned bright red and burning hot. Then, he aimed his fist at his opponent and smashed his fist towards him.Rumble~~~ Bang bang~~~The sound of a terrifying shockwave reverberated throughout the world, and a massive sound wave instantly spread throughout the entire arena at the speed of sound, causing the protective barrier to sway violently and almost break open! This was the protective barrier that even Aiolos and Gollon could not move when they were fighting. However, at that moment, the impact of Napier’s power was enough to reach this stage, even without any collision of rules or laws! It was no wonder that those sacred physical practitioners were all called monsters. Perhaps they could not kill enemies using dubious methods like the controllers of laws could, but the most direct display of their power was enough to ignite the passion of ordinary people.Carloze could sense the surging power of his enemy’s vital energy through his fist, and could sense his enemy’s exuberant and burning combat spirit. It was as if he had been looking for this illusory enemy and friend throughout his life with great difficulty!How satisfying! How satisfying!He never thought that he would be able to fight in such a satisfying manner when faced with a Gold Core assassin from the Earth who had just advanced.He was able to prove himself using his physical body and was one of the commanders of the Blood Demon Race in the outside battlefields. He was truly someone who loved battles and was even crazier than the majority of the so-called combat maniacs who challenged others everywhere! He slaughtered enemies daily without stopping in the external battlefields that others were afraid of, and these battlefields were like heaven to the past him.However, ever since he had successfully proven himself with his physical body, it had been a very long time since he had fought a satisfying fight in the foreign territories. This did not mean that no one there could match up to him, but he simply could not find a true soldier who would determine victory and defeat using their physical bodies! Furthermore, Carloze looked down upon those experts who played with various laws the most. They were all cowards, and no one dared to stand in front of him and have a proper fight with him like a true male would.But now, that person had appeared. It was the seemingly absurd and amusing clown!“Die!”Carloze’s eyes had turned red from excitement, and the spiritual power that rapidly surged from his body started scorching like a blood-colored flame. Furthermore, his opponent was just like him! If the runic array formed by the Combat Armor was not present, he would have doubted whether this was an illusion.But now, there was no doubt. He believed in the judgment abilities of the Combat Rune Armor as it had never been wrong before. It was inherited from an ancient level-8 civilization and contained a wisp of the Draconic Spiritual Power that no longer existed in this world. No illusion could purposely obscure him with the searching abilities of the Combat Rune Armor in play!This was the clown’s true strength. Just like the previous Earthling Aiolos, they were true soldiers. Furthermore, this clown was much stronger than Aiolos.There were no conspiracies or assassinations. There was only a proper fight between them, a collision of blood and flesh. This was the element that could excite Carloze from the depths of his bones! As a result, his fighting spirits were high; his blood was boiling, and he was thoroughly satisfied!Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!Terrifying crashing sounds continuously trembled throughout the arena. Every crash resembled a violent earthquake, causing this entire arena and half of the Machinery Palace to tremble with a buzzing sound!However, Carloze was the only excited one…Besides the terrifying bombarding sounds, the entire arena was deathly silent. Meanwhile, on the spectator stands, the Blood Demon Ancestor’s expression was livid.What was Carloze doing?! Was—was he crazy?Carloze’s hands were wrestling with each other as his left and right hands continuously clashed. Meanwhile, the impact of the collisions landed on his body, causing blood to flow from his mouth. However, he still shouted loudly in satisfaction!Not bad. As an almighty expert who had proven himself using his physical body, Carloze was said to have one of the most powerful defenses in the Land and claimed to have an undying body. At the same time, his fist was also one of the strongest weapons in the Land! To this monster who had focused on his physical body, what could his fist not resolve? Even the most powerful defenses of the undying body would be defeated in the face of his fist.Was this an illusion technique?Impossible!The Blood Demon Ancestor understood Carloze’s abilities very well. His soul was his only weakness, and he was not skilled in resisting illusion techniques. However, the Blood Demon Ancestor understood the functions and ability of the precious Combat Armor even better. All illusory techniques simply hindered one’s eyesight. Furthermore, no illusory technique could hinder one’s vision in the face of the runic array from the Combat Rune Armor as it was a precious treasure that contained a wisp of Draconic Spiritual Power. Thus, any illusions would disperse in the face of this genuine Draconic Spiritual Power.However, the reality was right in front of his eyes. How did that Earthling do it?!The Blood Demon Ancestor could not help but look at the arena. However, he saw a clown-like figure sitting at the side of the arena at that moment. As it watched Carloze frantically attack himself, it was chewing on… a fruit?!“Is this… a puppet technique?” Julienne was simply stunned as golden lights flashed in her eyes. “Has he turned his Gold Core into his puppet?”Being born in the Extreme Ice World, puppet techniques were a topic they were most interested in and a skill that they were most adept in. At that moment, Carloze seemed like a puppet that was being controlled who would do whatever he was made to do. He would not hesitate, even if he was made to kill himself.“It’s not a puppet.” Wang Zhong shook his head and could not help but laugh out loud. “In Napier’s words, he calls this the Great Magician Laws…”Frankly speaking, illusion techniques were the foundation of such techniques, including falsification, deceit, and induction. However, Napier had understood the extremes of illusions. His soul, his nature, his experiences, and everything he worshipped were elevated to a higher level when he obtained the Great Magician techniques. He was the first human to achieve his Gold Core, and at the same time, this allowed his illusory techniques to advance to the level of illusory laws —— this was a transformation!He had made great achievements in turning the illusory into reality. He turned illusions into the truth, and no artifact could break through this terrifying power.Thus, Carloze’s Combat Rune Armor was unable to unravel this technique as this was not an illusion technique!Everything was real in Carloze’s “world”. The clown that he was continuously clashing with was himself, as his love for combat was part of his instinct. Regardless of whether it was because of his pride or his personality, his greatest enemy would always be him and him alone. What Napier wanted to do was no more than to tease out his inner demon and then conceal half of his soul’s vision. As a result, he would see the half-Carloze as a complete person. Then, everything else that had happened would be Carloze’s own story…“You can do that?” Julienne seemed lost in thought, even though she did not understand this at all.Napier had finished eating his apple and took out a banana. When he was done with his banana, he took out a pear… It was as if this fellow’s pocket was filled with an endless supply of fruits.Meanwhile, in the arena, Carloze had started to slow down. It was not that he did not have enough stamina, but his injuries had become too severe. His hands were continuously hitting each other with his strongest power, and he exchanged injuries for injuries…The hardest person to defeat was oneself. This was the case no matter how strong the enemy was.The surroundings had remained silent from the beginning, and the entire world had already predicted Carloze’s outcome. The only one who did not know was Carloze, who was still fighting.Huff, puff, huff, puff…Carloze finally stopped and panted heavily like an ox. His entire body was filled with severe injuries that were sunk deep into his body. Meanwhile, his churning vital energy and surging spiritual power spread in all directions, shrouding the entire arena in a seething bloody fog. However, his eyes were still cross-eyed, as if they were looking at each other, even as a cruel light flashed past them.Meanwhile, Napier, who had been sitting at the side, finally stood up at that moment. He threw the cooked egg shells in his hands aside and clapped his hands.“It’s time for the curtain call,” said Napier cheerily. Then, he faintly snapped his fingers.Carloze sensed a strong sense of danger surging in his head. Then, the powerful enemy he had never encountered before approached him. It was as if his enemy was also exhausted and had used up all his resources. However, a powerful killing aura instantly burst forth at that moment!He subconsciously clenched his fist tightly and fiercely smashed his fist into his opponent’s head. Meanwhile, his opponent had exactly the same reaction and action as him.“Die!”Carloze shot out a cruel gaze at “him”. It felt as if he had returned to the satisfying days of desperately slaughtering enemies on the battlefield when he had still been weak. The fear of life and death stimulated his nerves, making him excited and moved. Then, the remaining terrifying power in his body burst forth in this moment.Boom!A cloud of blood exploded and splattered everywhere. The head of this so-called undying body broke into many pieces like a rotten watermelon, with red and white pieces flying everywhere. Countless droplets of brain juice and blood splattered everywhere, and a Gold Core flew out from that shattered head.The will of the fragmented soul that remained in his Gold Core finally awakened at this moment. He saw that his unshakable fists had sunk deep into his own head, and his head had been broken into pieces. Only a headless corpse was standing motionless in the middle of the arena. Meanwhile, his enemy, the clown soldier that he had seen as his “friend” went back to his original weak and thin self. The clown grinned cheekily and flashed an exaggerated expression while standing beside his corpse.He had lost?!Before he could finish processing this thought, in the next second, a golden light flew past. Carloze’s Gold Core had been drawn by a wave of power and rapidly fell into the hands of the Blood Demon Ancestor, who was on the spectator stands.He was furious on the inside, but there was no expression on his face, and he did not say anything.The Blood Demon Race had already lost a Gold Core and could not afford to lose a second one! Even though this clown likely did not have the ability to destroy a Gold Core, the Blood Demon Ancestor did not want to risk it.Had they… won again…? Was this another victory?Unlike the deafening cheers when Aiolos had won, at that moment, the stands were completely silent.This battle seemed far too easy, so easy that even Ma Dong and the others on the spectator stands did not dare to believe this. More accurately, this did not feel real.An almighty Gold Core had been defeated as well. Previously, Aiolos’s victory was very desperate as he had burst forth with so many trump cards during the battle. The spectators had thought that that was the limit of the Earthlings, but they never thought that Napier would be able to win so easily. He simply sat there and ate a few fruits. This, this…Not only was Ma Dong silent, but no one in the spectator stands was even able to speak.This was simply unbelievable.The Blood Demon Race had lost the first battle, and Gollon had been killed by that Earthling gladiator. Regardless of whether one said that Gollon was careless or that the injuries Gollon had previously suffered had not recovered, it was all fine. After all, the Earthling had displayed his natural endowments, had been guided by the Titans, and had even learned a secret technique from the Titan Race. Thus, he was indeed strong. But what in the world was this monster?One of the three dignified commanders of the Blood Demon Race, a general who had often secured victories in foreign territories, had mysteriously lost in the hands of such an unknown fighter?! Even though everyone knew that this clown was the only Gold Core from the Earth, he was simply a minor Gold Core who had just advanced. What gave him the right to kill an almighty expert like that? Huh?!The Blood Demon Race at the spectator stands had fallen entirely silent. Absolutely no one had imagined such a scene before the battle. Wang Zhong and Mu Zi from the Earth had not appeared, but the Blood Demon Race had already lost 0-2 to the Earth. What in the world were these Earthlings? Where did they all appear from? Regardless of what logic that final mysterious method used, and regardless of whether he had just advanced, if he managed to kill Carloze, then he was an expert! How could such an expert be completely unknown in the Land?!Aiolos was like this, and so was Napier. Then what about the other Earthlings?Putting Wang Zhong and Mu Zi aside, Mo Xingchen, Julienne, Vladimir, Grai, and Mo Wen… Wouldn’t they be the same?The Blood Demon Ancestor’s expression darkened, and information about these five people instantly flashed through his mind several dozen times.To be honest, the Blood Demon Race’s information inquiry was truly lacking this time. They only knew the Earth’s final roster when they appeared on the arena. Now, they had lost two consecutive battles, and the most powerful Wang Zhong and Mu Zi had not yet appeared! This was not simply because the Earth was very strong, but also because of their lack of information! If they had understood the strength of these two people earlier, regardless of whether they made Gollon and Carloze prepare in advance or sent out more targeted experts, they would not have lost two consecutive battles.In fact, even though he had witnessed that battle through the lens of a discerning spectator, the Blood Demon Ancestor still could not determine exactly what technique the clown had used to confuse Carloze. The only thing he could see was that the clown possessed some kind of power of the laws. Was this a realm that a Gold Core who had just advanced could achieve?It was fine if the Earth had a Wang Zhong, and they could tolerate it if Aiolos appeared, but even this obscure clown was like this as well?!The Blood Demon Ancestor could tell that regardless of whether it was the Solid Cores or the newly-advanced Gold Core from Earth, all of them seemed to be able to reach and achieve the realm of laws! It was simply a big mistake to use the strength standards of the Land to judge this group of people.The Blood Demon Race did not have such important information! On the contrary, the Earth understood the information they had on hand very well. Regardless of whether it was for Gollon or for Carloze, their famous techniques and even their combat style were obviously within the Earthlings’ expectations. Thus, the two participants who had been sent out were targeted at these enemies! In particular, this clown had the ability to confuse others. This was the only method the Earth had against Carloze. In other words, if they went head-on against Carloze, none of the Earthlings could match up to him! The only one who could defeat Carloze was Carloze himself!Information asymmetry was supposed to be the customary method that high-leveled civilizations used to suppress low-leveled civilization. However, they never thought that the Blood Demon Race would actually be suppressed by the Earth in this aspect! Then what about the following fights? Besides Wang Zhong and Mu Zi, would the Earth have a third hidden expert like Aiolos or Napier?Ever since their first Civilization War, this was the first time the Blood Demon Ancestor felt pressure from one. How could the Blood Demon Race possibly lose?This was truly a massive joke!“How satisfying! Ha ha, how satisfying!” The Titan Patriarch Tsarlozst laughed out loud. “Blood Shadow old one, it looks like the Blood Demon Race is on the road to complete defeat! You have already suffered two defeats. Ha ha ha, shouldn’t you hurry up and go there to stabilize the situation? The Gold Cores in the Blood Demon Race are not good enough. You were played to death by just an illusion technique. This is simply too much!”The Titan elder could obviously tell that the clown was extraordinary and that this was definitely not an ordinary illusion technique. However, he hid this knowledge and acted as if he was confused. In fact, he had said these words intentionally. Indeed, this was Carloze’s only weakness, as well as the simplest and most effective explanation in the eyes of the majority.The Titan elder teased the Blood Demon Ancestor recklessly, and the Blood Demon Ancestor could sense the delight on the Titan’s face even though he was sitting several dozen meters away. However, he simply took a deep breath.Now was not the time to argue with the Titan Race.Him going into battle? When faced with the extremely mysterious Earth, it was obvious that only the Blood Demon Ancestor had 100% certainty that he would win. However, the Earth obtained the initiative with two wins and could exchange a loss for two wins now. Allowing a weakling to be fielded against him was just like the Blood Demon Race giving their best trump card to the Earth.</p> </div> </div> <div class="row turn-page"> <a class="col-xs-2" href="/Battle%20Frenzy/1219.html?v=1662299025846">Previous</a> <a class="col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:center;" href="/Battle%20Frenzy/book.html?v=1662299025845">Table</a> <a class="col-xs-2 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:right;" href="/Battle%20Frenzy/1221.html?v=1662299025847"> Next</a> </div> <hr></div><hr><footer class="container"> <p>© Company 2014</p></footer><amp-lightbox id="searchLightbox" class="-il" layout="nodisplay" on="lightboxOpen:searchInput.focus; lightboxClose:searchTriggerOpen.focus" scrollable="" hidden="hidden"> <div> <div class="-ic" role="button" tabindex="0" on="tap:searchLightbox.close"></div> <div class="-ih"> <div class="-sg -sb" on="tap: searchLightbox.close, AMP.setState({ query: '' }), searchForm.clear" role="button" tabindex="0"> <div class="ap-a-ico -sw"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#close"></use> </svg> </div> </div> <div class="ap-o-search-field"> <form action="#" action-xhr="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/echo" class="-ip" id="searchForm" on="submit:AMP.setState({ query: throttledValue }),searchResult.focus" target="_top"> <amp-autocomplete class="-id" filter="substring" min-characters="1" on="select:AMP.setState({ query: event.value })" submit-on-enter="false" src="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/autosuggest"> <div class="ap-a-ico -im"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#search"></use> </svg> </div> <input id="searchInput" class="-iv" name="q" placeholder="What are you looking for?" on="input-throttled:AMP.setState({ throttledValue: event.value })" required=""> <button class="-ig" type="submit" name="search-submit" disabled="" [disabled]="!throttledValue">Search </button> <div role="listbox"></div> </amp-autocomplete> </form> <div class="empty" [class]="query ?
