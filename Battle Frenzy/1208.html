</p><p>Editor:&nbsp;</p><p>Atlas StudiosThe entire world fell silent and lost all sound. More accurately, the miserable state of the Blood Demon Race in the short half a minute shocked everyone into silence.They had heard the terrifying legend of the Blood Demon Race previously destroying a level-7 civilization with the flip of the hand and knew that it was with the power of a curse. However, no one had ever thought that the curse would be this tyrannical.Half a minute! It only took half a minute! A powerful civilization had vanished completely, and their deaths were so miserable! It was no wonder that for the past several dozen eras, regardless of how great the offense by the Blood Demon Race was, the Star Alliance usually chose superficial and minor punishments. This was because no civilization was willing to completely oppose the Blood Demon Race. They were definitely a terrifying power that could bring any civilization in the Star Alliance down if they were desperate.However, such a strong power had been extinguished with the wave of a hand by an individual. Furthermore, this person was merely a Solid Core…Countless people on the spectator stands felt a chill down their spine. The more they understood how powerful the Blood Demon Race was, the more they could sense Wang Zhong’s strength! Putting aside the level-5 and level-6 civilizations, even the several level-8 civilization higher-ups on the host’s seats all stood up at that moment.A Solid Core? A junior? With such strength, everyone no longer saw the Earth as a civilization they could control.A true expert could receive absolute respect! Furthermore, this was a terrifying being who had enough might to completely reshuffle the distribution of power in the Land.“The Civilization War between the Blood Demon Race and the Earthling Race…” Superintendent Erza took a deep breath. The voice reverberated through the air with her typical might, as well as a hint of respect for Wang Zhong. “The winner is the Earth!”The entire arena paused for a brief few seconds. This was not because of Superintendent Erza’s announcement, but because of Superintendent Erza’s voice that pulled them back from their shock and astonishment.Clap clap clap…A round of applause first sounded from the host’s seats. This was from the group of bosses that included Elder Yimo, Elder Elder Yimo, Patriarch Kalidan, and the others.Closely after, the Titans, the Illusion Race, the Ocean Empire Planet, and the Heavenly Treasures Street…Clap! Clap clap clap! Clap clap clap clap clap clap!“Earth! Earth! Earth!”“Master Wang Zhong is the best in the world!”“The Earth is invincible!”“I love the monk!” “I love the baldie!”“Boss! That’s my boss! Hey, hey, hey, he is really my boss. We share a room in the Heavenly Gates! Damn, who dares not to give in to him! Stand up and let me see!”Very quickly, the scattered applause turned concordant and was accompanied by earth-shaking cheers and frenzied laughter. It was as if a prairie fire had instantly set the entire arena ablaze.This was a result that had surprised everyone. Many people would definitely lose money today, but even those who had lost on their bets were sincerely cheering at that moment.So what if they lost some money? What was more moving than personally witnessing a new era and the birth of a king who would be recorded in history books?Victory? They had won?!At the Earthling seats, Wang Zhanfeng, Lan Daier, and the others were already brimming with tears. Laura and Milami were excitedly hugging each other, while Emily firmly pulled Ma Dong’s already short hair. “Ma Dongdong! We’ve won! We’ve won! Brother Wang Zhong won!”“I know! I know!” Ma Dong clenched his teeth. At this moment, he did not maintain the image of a high-ranking officer that he had nurtured over the past few years. He cried, laughed, and clenched his teeth. His cousin was too strong, and his scalp was really going to fall off from her pulling. However, he forgot to criticize her harshly as, at this moment, he was no longer the ruler of the Earth. Instead, he was just an ordinary person of Earth, which had won its high-stakes gamble. He was also Wang Zhong’s brother. His eyes were red and moist, but he did not know whether it was because he was in pain or because he was touched. “Lao Wang is still so amazing!”In the Earth waiting room, Mu Zi, Aiolos, Mo Wen, and the others charged out and surrounded Wang Zhong in the arena.“Wang Zhong!”Everyone’s eyes were filled with joy. Even though everyone had come to this Civilization War with a firm attitude that did not allow them to look back, but in reality, besides Mu Zi, even the strongest Mo Wen did not have any certainty that they could win against the Blood Demon Race, let alone simply eliminate the entire Blood Demon Race!Lao Wang simply smiled and stood in the world of the black and white chessboard. This feeling was extremely marvelous, as if he controlled everything. He could even easily distinguish which cheers were sincere and which were fake amidst the one million people present. In fact, he could sense countless errant, envious, and jealous individuals… Of course, all these were no longer important.The Earth had been a “mere level-4 civilization” in everyone’s eyes, yet they had easily eliminated the Blood Demon Race with five straight wins. This differed greatly from what everyone had predicted, and there would definitely be a disparity in their mentality. Furthermore, the Blood Demon Race had established themselves in the Star Alliance over several dozen eras and would have some loyal allies and subordinate civilizations. Thus, it was reasonable for them to produce various emotions. However, they obviously could only think of hating the Earth in their minds. When faced with the Earth, which was at the peak of its power, these people were powerless to cause any more waves.He simply looked up into the sky and in the direction of Superintendent Erza.The Civilization War had ended, but the Earth had not yet received the Blood Demon Race’s assets. This would be the transfer of a large amount of wealth. Even though no one now dared to offend the Earth, if the Star Alliance did not say anything or help them, the Earth would not even be able to estimate how much capital the Blood Demon Race had, let alone accept it.There was a complex expression in Superintendent Erza’s eyes, but this was not hesitation. Instead, when she faced Wang Zhong, who she had seen as a junior not too long ago, she would inevitably have some different emotions towards him. However, she controlled those thoughts very quickly and announced in a clear voice, “The Earth has won the Civilization War and will replace the Blood Demon Race. As the Superintendent of the Heavenly Gates and the Vice President of the Star Alliance Executive Council, I appoint the Earth as the twenty-first level-7 civilization!”The vast voice caused the extremely lively arena to gradually fall silent once again. Even though everyone knew that the Earth would definitely receive all of these, the attitude of the Star Alliance could still determine many things. After all, the Blood Demon Race had suffered the backlash of the Blood Propagation Curse and had probably died out completely in those short few minutes. Many civilizations who had business relations or credit transactions with the Blood Demon Race perked up their ears. If the Star Alliance’s announcement was even slightly vague, they could use it to disclaim their old debts with the Blood Demon Race.“At the same time, considering that there are no survivors from the Blood Demon Race, the Star Alliance will immediately and temporarily take hold of all the assets, debts, property, and wealth of the Blood Demon Race. The Machinery Race will be involved in counting and checking the property of the Blood Demon Race. All civilizations who have business dealings with the Blood Demon Race must actively cooperate. If anyone tries to be opportunistic and embezzles the wealth that should belong to the Earth in any form, once investigations have been completed, light offenders will be given a fine ten times heavier than the usual amount. Meanwhile, heavy offenders will be punished for betraying the Star Alliance!”The arena was silent, and all was quiet.As expected…Everyone had seen how the Star Alliance dealt with the wealth of civilizations that had been extinguished and had their assets confiscated. Typically, when a civilization had been eliminated, only their material wealth that remained on the surface would be counted most of the time. As for the secret debts, the Star Alliance would usually turn a blind eye to them. If one was willing to, they could declare these debts, but if they were not willing to, they would simply leave it. On the one hand, most of the civilizations whose possessions had been confiscated were only level-5 or level-6. Their wealth was limited, and the Star Alliance made little of their assets. On the other hand, the job of checking the accounts for an enormous civilization was too troublesome and complex. It was also impossible to check all the accounts clearly as this project was just too large.But looking at the current situation, they were going to clearly check all the accounts of the Blood Demon Race and even have the Machinery Race step in to check all civilizations who had business dealings with the Blood Demon Race! What a vast project that would waste a lot of manpower and material resources! In the end, they were purely helping the Earth, and the Star Alliance would not benefit in any way.However, the Star Alliance did not hesitate at all. Instead, they also enforced the most severe punishment!However, one could imagine that with such high pressure, there would definitely be no one who dared to think of opportunistically defaulting on their debts. Yes, the Star Alliance could not possibly check all the accounts clearly, but one could never be too careful. Once the Machinery Race discovered them, they might face a great disaster that would wipe out their race.This gave the Earthlings a lot of face… No, it should be said that this showed due respect for Wang Zhong!Even the several lofty level-8 civilizations in the Star Alliance could sense how terrifying and awe-inspiring Wang Zhong was. They treated the Earth as a superpower that was on equal footing as them.“Thank you, Superintendent!” There was no pleasant surprise or sentiment on Lao Wang’s expression. He was simply very calm. A person’s state of mind determined one’s strength to a very large extent. When one truly stood at the top of the world and looked at the rest of the world, they would realize that very few things in this world could shock or surprise them.“Wang Zhong! Wang Zhong! Wang Zhong! Wang Zhong!”No one knew who had started it, but Wang Zhong’s name started to reverberate throughout the arena. Almost one million people shouted in unison. Their voices echoed throughout the vast arena and throughout the Machinery Palace.The Earth had risen, and Wang Zhong had climbed to the top! No one could stop them in this world!……The job of receiving the Blood Demon Race’s wealth was much more successful and easier than imagined. This was thanks to the high-pressure punishment that Superintendent Erza had announced, as well as the high efficiency of the Machinery Race. After only half a month, all of the Blood Demon Race’s capital had been accounted for.Just the Blood Demon Castle alone stored six trillion Gold Star Stones, which was enough to rival the output of Gold Star Stones in the Star Alliance for the past several decades. They were all gathered in one castle. After accumulating Gold Star Stones for several dozen eras, the wealth of the Blood Demon Race was simply dumbfounding.However, to a truly powerful civilization, Gold Star Stones were obviously only a very small portion of their massive wealth. True experts were not misers who could only accumulate wealth. They were more than willing to turn their cash into various material goods and strength. These were many things that the Blood Demon Castle alone could not accommodate.In total, the Machinery Race discovered nine large “warehouses” that belonged to the Blood Demon Race, which were all located on planets at the peripheral worlds that had been invaded and occupied by the Blood Demon Race to store their objects.There were mountains of pills, seas of equipment of various ranks, as well as combat fortresses, spiritual protective barriers, and other objects of various ranks that could completely cover an entire planet. Just counting these items took the Machinery Race about half a month, and this was under the circumstances where they had discovered a lot of information on the current assets that belonged to the Blood Demon Race. If they wanted to make a detailed inventory list, it would probably take countless years to do so.Ma Dong was extremely busy. After all, receiving these items was not an easy job.In the past, he had always thought that the Earth was too poor, but now, it felt as if they were too rich. In the past, he had always thought that there were too many Earthlings densely packed in the cities that were safeguarded by protection walls, but now, it felt as if there were too few people!There were so few people that they did not have enough of them to accept and manage these goods. Putting aside the elites on Earth, even the most ordinary Earthlings had been sent to manage the star trains that contained goods. Even mutated humans had taken on a new lease on life and became the managers of various warehouses. There was no choice as they only had a few billion Earthlings. As compared to those civilizations who were truly developed, had passed on their inheritance through countless years, and occupied many planets, there were far too few Earthlings. They had to encourage births. If not, many families would be left idle.……“Indeed, our population is too small. Furthermore, the Earth rose to power too quickly, and I’m afraid that we will quickly face the greatest frustration that high-leveled civilizations face — the more perfect our genes are, the harder it will be to pass them on.” Lao Wang looked at the person on the other end of the video call and sighed sentimentally. As of present, the Earth had completely integrated with the Star Alliance. In the past, communication had been a problem that caused Earthlings a lot of headaches. Now that they had money and power, as well as the assistance of a super-technological civilization like the Machinery Race, it was simply too easy.On the other end of the video call, a woman laughed. “You… We managed to communicate after much difficulty just for you to talk about the future of the Earth with me.”“Ha ha ha ha!” Lao Wang laughed out loud. “I’m not so noble, my love. I’m talking about our future.”“Oh?” Scarlet’s eyes dazzled. How could she blame Wang Zhong? She knew that Wang Zhong was this kind of person and was simply joking with him.It had been three years. Wang Zhong had gone to the divine territory for three years, and she had been waiting on Earth for those three years. A few days ago, due to the hatred between the Earth and the Blood Demon Race, Ma Dong was afraid that the Blood Demon Race would secretly send someone to take her hostage in order to threaten Wang Zhong. Thus, for her safety, Ma Dong had hidden Scarlet in an isolated secret world.Luckily, the Earth had advanced to a level-7 civilization and was now extremely wealthy. Thus, immediate communication and the like were not a problem at all. As long as Scarlet and Lao Wang were willing to, they could talk over video throughout the night.“A few days ago, Elder Yimo gave me a secret technique. He said that it was often used by the aristocrat races in high-leveled civilizations to pass on their genes and is said to have a 100% success rate… It’s just that the materials needed are slightly complex,” Lao Wang said. “I’m gathering the materials over here. Once I’ve gathered them, let’s try it out. We have to work hard. Isn’t Ma Dongdong encouraging childbirth? We have to set a good example for the Earth population to flourish. There is no shirking our responsibility!”“Says you!” Scarlet’s face turned slightly red, but this was not because she was embarrassed. They were an old married couple, and this was not much. Furthermore, they had not seen each other for three years and were filled with burning passion for each other. After not seeing each other for such a lengthy time, they longed for each other greatly. The bright red expression on her face was something that only Wang Zhong could see. “When you were on Earth a few years ago, I never saw you working this hard!”“Hey! That’s an unjust verdict, a great injustice!” Lao Wang was serious. “I was treasuring your body. Back then, your injuries were still not stable.”“What a joke.” Scarlet cheerily curled a finger through the video call projection. “Only men will be tired.”“Whatever you say…” Lao Wang could not help but laugh. He rubbed his hands together. An originally warm and touching call had turned slightly inappropriate.Suddenly, the door of Scarlet’s room was shoved open.“Oh? Sister, who are you chatting with?” Emily thoughtlessly walked in while eating an ice cream cone.“Cough cough!”Scarlet coughed slightly, and her entire face instantly turned bright red. Emily turned towards the video. Then, she was pleasantly surprised. “Brother Wang Zhong?!”Lao Wang did not know whether to laugh or to cry. The passion that Scarlet had provoked was instantly cleansed thoroughly by this girl. What a bad time for her to appear! Why did she have to appear now? If this happened all the time, there would be a problem!“Ahem…” As expected of a couple who looked alike, Lao Wang even looked exactly the same as Scarlet when he pretended to cough.Emily seemed to have realized something and scratched the back of her head with an awkward expression on her face. “Oh, did I disturb your happy occasion?”“What do you think…?” Lao Wang could only look at her with hidden bitterness.“Yes, yes, yes, it’s all my fault. So what…” Over the past few years, Emily had changed a lot. At the very least, she was no longer the girl who could not tell whose family Wang Zhong belonged to. She stuck out her tongue. “Sister, the Soul Molding Pills from the Star Alliance have arrived. Ma Dongdong asked me to send them to you…“I’ll put them here.” Emily took out a small box and placed it on the table. Then, she cheerily made her retreat. “You can continue, continue. I won’t disturb you flirting with each other.”After this small star of calamity had left, they wanted to adjust their emotions and continue their previous topic. However, after looking at each other for a while, they realized that those emotions had been destroyed and cleaned out by that girl and would not come back.In the end, the two of them could not help but laugh out loud.Life was still very long, and no one in the Land could destroy the joy between the two of them. There was no need to hurry.“When will you come back?” Scarlet asked gently.“I can’t be sure for now. The Earth has just joined the Star Alliance Executive Council, and I am one of the members of the Executive Council. Currently, the Star Alliance is going through an eventful period, and I also have to personally deal with some powers that are loyal to the Blood Demon Race. I’m afraid that I won’t be able to leave in the short-term…” Wang Zhong thought about it. “But Mo Wen let everyone go to the Mirror World because there is a reflection of the origins of the Earth there. I’m thinking of taking some time off to also take a look. The Mirror World is different from the Land, and the spiritual power and gravity are not as great as in the Land. I’ll ask the Machinery Race to customize a set of protective clothing for you. Then, you and Ma Dongdong can come together.”“Okay!” Scarlet’s eyes lit up. To her, there was nothing in this world that was more important and made her happier than being with Wang Zhong.“I added some raw materials and specially made those Perfect Soul Molding Pills to target your illness,” said Wang Zhong with a smile as he pointed to the box that Emily had just placed on the table. “Take one pill every week. After at most half a year, your soul injuries when you broke through to the Heavenly Soul Stage should heal.”“Okay!” Even though Scarlet already knew that Wang Zhong had created these especially efficacious pills, she did not hope for too much. She was now very well. Unlike other people, she truly felt that the Earth was very good. Perhaps the outside world was flashy and splendid, but she preferred the Earth. Maybe this would change in the future, but this was not the time for that.Scarlet was immersed in happiness as she heard everything that Lao Wang had to say. After some time, she finally thought of something else. “That’s right, I have some bad news that I haven’t told you about. Old Potter passed away just yesterday…”Lao Wang was dumbfounded by this familiar name. The voice and expression of an old person instantly appeared in his mind.Back when Wang Zhong was still in Tianjing Academy as a minor, Old Potter had already established a friendship between generations with him. Thus, Wang Zhong was able to come into contact with information about the Fifth Dimension and do research on living runes. As for the backstabbing that he encountered from the 10 Great Families after the CHF, Old Potter had also risked his life to protect many relatives and friends of Wang Zhong. He was a loveable and respectable old man.Three years ago, Wang Zhong had paid him a visit before leaving Earth. Back then, there did not seem to be any issues with his body. However, they had parted forever in just three years.Lao Wang fell silent. His excitement had been swept clean, and he simply felt that his heart was heavy.“How about Laura? How is she?”“Not too good.” Scarlet shook her head. “On the one hand, she is extremely sad. Her parents are no longer around, and Mister Potter was her only blood relative left. On the other hand, several children in the Copperfield family seem to want to fight for power. Their grandfather just passed on yesterday, but I heard that the family is already breaking up today. Laura doesn’t want to care about these matters, but she was personally appointed by Mister Potter as the top heir of the Copperfield family.”Lao Wang furrowed his eyebrows. Scarlet paused before continuing, “If it only involved a few children, it would be easy to resolve, but I heard that some Star Alliance powers are involved… You know that the great families on Earth are now hot commodities in the Star Alliance. Those who invest in them have a lot of money. Furthermore, they have used proper procedures to invest in their stocks. They are rightful directors in the shares system, so Ma Dong and the others cannot step in. If they are allowed to continue like this, Laura will not be able to bring them under control. If the Copperfield family truly breaks up, Mister Potter will not be able to rest peacefully in Heaven.”“The Star Alliance powers?” Lao Wang’s voice was slightly cold. “I got it. Let me settle this matter. Let me see which power in the Star Alliance dares to provoke me!”“You?” Scarlet smiled ambiguously.“Oh, don’t overthink it. I was just blurting out without thinking…”“Look at how nervous you are. Am I so petty?” Scarlet smiled. Laura had not sought her help for this matter. Scarlet had heard about it and told Wang Zhong out of her own initiative.Scarlet understood Laura’s feelings towards Wang Zhong very well. After so many years, Laura had never even faked an expression towards any other man. In fact, Scarlet even knew that Wang Zhong had always had a favorable opinion of Laura. Furthermore, Laura had natural endowments in cultivation and was among the first batch of Void Cores on Earth besides Wang Zhong and the others. It was not a fantasy for Laura to accumulate her Gold Core and achieve immortality in the future.“If you have the time, chat more with Laura. Besides Mister Potter, she will only listen to your words.” Scarlet sighed. “Right now, she is far too early. I went to the Copperfield family yesterday, but everyone was struggling for power in the enormous room. At night, she was the only one keeping vigil for Mister Potter… She seemed very thin and pallid. I’m really afraid that she will not be able to recover from this.”“Sure.”After cutting off communications, Lao Wang’s heart was somewhat heavy.Even though he was the top person in the Land, there were still far too many things he could not control in this world, such as mortality.Wang Zhong closed his eyes and remained silent for about two or three minutes. It was as if he was thinking silently but also seemed as if he was grieving over a death.The departed were already gone, but the days of the living still had to continue.He activated communications again and connected with Ma Dong. “Do you have the details on the Copperfield family?”“It’s slightly complicated…”He could tell that Ma Dong had just stayed up all night. Recently, he was already very busy, and Old Potter’s death would cause major fluctuations of authority in the higher-ups on Earth. After all, ever since the Earth rose as a new power, the Copperfield family, represented by Laura who was the first to accumulate her Void Core, had truly entered the highest ranks of the Earth. In fact, they had even pushed the top five families among the 10 Great Families down the ranks. “Many Star Alliance powers are involved, and they are all investors of the Copperfield family… Furthermore, what’s even more troublesome is that after Laura accumulated her Void Core, she simply became too dazzling to our people and took away too much of the spotlight. Thus, the people on Earth only recognize Laura, but not the Copperfields. As a result, many children are jealous, and they are divided in heart and practice. This even involves Laura’s blood brother. Do you remember him? That one from the Holy City… These children have colluded with domestic and foreign shareholders in the Star Alliance. Regardless of whether it is their personal or official affairs, it’s very hard for me to step in. This is the most troublesome part.”“Oh, this really sounds unpleasant, but Old Potter was somewhat muddled. He had sold many family stocks to fund his rune research. Even though the majority shareholder still seems to be Laura, the first heir in line, she only has 35% of the total stocks. The other shareholders are now all cooperating, and Laura is at a public disadvantage.”“Which Star Alliance powers?” Lao Wang’s tone was not very friendly.“They aren’t any great powers, just some level-5 and level-6 civilizations in public. However, those shareholders have bought their shares according to the official processes of the Star Alliance and have followed the economic conditions of the Star Alliance. It’s very difficult even if I want to step in. Lao Wang, do you have a way?”“There’s no need for polite words between brothers. Help Laura buy back those stocks,” Wang Zhong said. “I don’t care how much money it takes. You must settle this by today.”“Money is only a small issue. I’m just afraid that they will not be willing to sell…”“We will pay twice the amount of money they have spent on the shares.” Wang Zhong paused, and his voice turned cold. “If they are still unwilling to sell their shares, then tell them that I will personally pay a visit to their gates. When the time comes, the price will no longer be the same! As for the children of the family… I understand Old Potter and his thoughts… Just do what I told you. I, Wang Zhong, am also considered one of Old Potter’s disciples, not an outsider! If those children are willing to stay with the Copperfields, then they can stay. As for those who are unwilling, let them go away!”“Ha, since you are willing to appear personally, it will definitely be very easy.” Ma Dong laughed out loud. “I was just wondering if I should tell you about this. If not, Laura would not have been able to deal with this by herself. She’s too pitiful. I was just afraid that you’d be too busy and could not help with this… Speaking of which, why are you suddenly concerned about Laura? Do you have any ‘improper’ plans while she is in danger?”“We’re all old friends. Have some kindness when you speak.” Lao Wang rolled his eyes. When Ma Dong was in charge, he was always relieved. “I’ll leave it to you!”……“Laura, dragging on like this is no way to do it…”“Laura, even though you are the head of the family, as your uncle, I have to say a few words…”“Laura, your grandfather didn’t hand the family to you for you to do nothing! So what if you accumulated your Void Core? So what if you can fight? You need to have the ability to control the family situation. Only then will everyone be sincerely convinced…”The room was in an uproar. Laura quietly sat in front of the table and listened to her so-called relatives all talking at once. Her seemingly calm face concealed a heart that was already haggard.Her grandfather’s mourning room was next door. Until now, Laura still could not breathe freely after the scene where she held her grandfather’s hand before his death yesterday. She simply wanted to stay on vigil at her grandfather’s mourning room without doing or thinking of anything. She wanted to quietly cherish the memories of the past and accompany her grandfather through his last Earthly custom.However, these people had captured her here on the basis of family, and were clamoring and fighting beside her grandfather’s mourning room unscrupulously!Laura wanted to slap all these noisy people to death, but she knew that this was unacceptable. They all had the same blood as her and were also the direct descendants of her grandfather. If she did so beside her grandfather’s mourning room, her grandfather’s soul might not be able to rest peacefully in Heaven.She could only resist and listen to the abominable chattering from these people who tried to force her to agree to some laughable conditions that seemed beneficial to their family but would instead sell out their entire family. However, she was unable to refute. In fact, she did not have any authority to actually make decisions.If this wealth had not been personally handed over from her grandfather for her to protect, then Laura would not have minded at all. She was too lazy to involve herself with these detestable house flies over this wealth. However, the more she was entangled with them, the more Laura realized that she was no match for these eloquent relatives. Furthermore, they had strong level-5 and level-6 civilizations in the Star Alliance supporting them from behind. To the current Earth, level-5 and level-6 civilizations were not considered much, but without Wang Zhong and the other higher-ups, a single family could not even match up to the strength of a random level-4 civilization, let alone a level-5 or level-6 civilization.They used legal processes and the contracts they had personally signed with her grandfather. Furthermore, they had massive strength and countless wealth. Thus, they had bribed those disappointing children in their family into submission… In fact, this even included her own brother! Even her brother, who had once loved her the most, had betrayed her because of jealousy and money, let alone the others.No one could help her with this matter. She had to endure all of this. The family that her grandfather had valued the most had been passed on to her. She had wanted to let the family defend and support her, but she never expected that it would become her main source of hindrance and frustration instead.Listening to the chattering beside her ears, Laura suddenly felt somewhat frustrated.There were several billion Earthlings in this world, several billion people of the same race, yet Laura felt extremely lonely. It was as if she had returned to her childhood when she felt helpless after the passing of her parents. At that time, her grandfather had stretched out his hand to her, but now that her grandfather had left, who else would stretch out a warm hand to her?Ding ding ding~~The Skylink in Laura’s wrist rang and disrupted her train of thought.“Let me receive this call first.” She maintained a polite smile that no one could see through. This acting was very tiring but was a necessary action. If she allowed others to see the turmoil and fatigue in her heart, then she would lose. She had to stick to the position that her grandfather had left for her. She definitely could not allow those petty people with ulterior motives to strip away the effort that her grandfather had put in over his entire life.The room quietened down slightly. Then, Laura looked down and saw the familiar yet foreign profile picture shining on her Skylink.She was dumbfounded. A gap suddenly appeared in her psychological lines of defense that she had been guarding all along. Furthermore, this was a massive gap!“My apologies…” She stood up. She had wanted to conceal her feelings and say “excuse my absence”, but her chaotic heart and the emotional gap affected her intensely. As a result, she could not even say these most basic and simplest words to cover up. She started to choke with tears and could not continue speaking.She hurriedly left the table as the large group of people in the room gazed at her. Then, she quickly walked to her grandfather’s mourning hall in the next room.The dazzling profile picture had been dim for a very long time. This was the first time it had lit up in a few years!She adjusted her sobbing voice and picked up her Skylink. “Hello…”That man’s virtual projection appeared in front of her.“…How are you?”A familiar voice sounded beside her ear. It contained a warmth that Laura could never forget, just as always.Her sobs that she had stopped after much difficulty burst forth again. Laura could no longer resist it as burning hot tears surged forth from her eyes. “Wang Zhong! Grandpa is gone…”Wang Zhong nodded. “Bring your grandfather to the Heavenly Gates. The Natural Race is very adept at appeasing dead souls. If we engage them in some funeral affairs, perhaps it will be much easier when your grandfather reincarnates.”When he looked at Laura, who was crying like a crybaby, he sighed silently. “As for your family matters, don’t worry about them. I’ve asked Ma Dong to deal with them. The Star Alliance powers who are involved in this will hand over their shares very quickly. The Copperfield family will not break up. I promised your grandfather that as long as I have the ability to do so, I will definitely ensure that the Copperfield family will continue to prosper!”The virtual projection stretched out a hand to Laura. “Don’t cry. Come to the Land. Your grandfather may be gone, but you still have us!”Laura desperately nodded as her tears fell like melted wax. All her emotions that she had accumulated after the passing of her grandfather flowed out at this moment.What was a sense of security?It was not how powerful the people beside you were. Instead, it was whether this powerful person was willing to stretch out a helping hand without turning back when one most needed help.Furthermore, this person was him!……Every two or three eras in history, the Star Alliance would usually encounter a great calamity that involved most of the civilizations. There was an inevitable low period that would follow a prosperous one.Many people had seen the Civilization War between the Blood Demon Race and the Earth as the beginning of this Star Alliance calamity, but had never thought that this beginning would also be the end. Even though a level-7 civilization, as well as seven or eight subordinate level-5 and level-6 civilizations, had been toppled, the sudden concession of the Fire Demon Race caused the tumultuous Star Alliance to suddenly calm down and stabilize.Most people would not rack their brains to dig up the secrets behind this, but almost everyone knew that this was all thanks to Wang Zhong and his Earth. If it was not for the Earth’s powerful rise to power that allowed the Heavenly Shell Race to occupy the absolute advantage in their struggle for power, the Fire Demon Race would definitely not admit their loss. Then, the great calamity that involved the entire Star Alliance would inevitably occur during the conflict between the two races.By preventing this disaster, it could be said that Wang Zhong and the Earth had saved millions of creatures in the Star Alliance. As a result, people could not help but revere them from the bottom of their hearts, not just because they feared his strength. Of course, in the Star Alliance, the long united must divide, and great powers could not stop this. Perhaps Wang Zhong and the Earth had only postponed this great calamity, but who cared? At the very least, a calamity would not occur for the next few generations. One could not determine their children’s future, so they would just leave the later generations to deal with what happened in the future.Nevertheless, they truly revered and worshipped the Earth for this. Everyone saw the Earthling Race as the second Heavenly Shell Race in the Star Alliance. In fact, besides several individuals who boasted about the past, most people felt that the Earth was much better than the Heavenly Shell Race back then when they were powerful and simply reigned throughout the ages.Furthermore, the names of Wang Zhong, Mu Zi, Mo Wen, Aiolos, Napier, Vladimir, and the others had spread throughout the Star Alliance. The latter five were called the Five Tigers of Earth.Meanwhile, Wang Zhong had been turned into a myth and was treated as a true deity who surpassed the king-leveled experts. He was not lacking in strength, identity, or status. Thus, he only needed to greet the Machinery Race to go to the Mirror World.“That’s the Tekuja Arena.” Mo Wen smiled and pointed to a broken and circular arena below them. “That was the headquarters of the Resistance Army and where I achieved enlightenment.”A dozen people, including Wang Zhong, hovered in the air and looked at the circular arena below them. This place occupied an extremely large area of several square kilometers. It could have rivaled the Fairy King Arena where the Civilization War was held, except that it was somewhat tattered with weeds growing.The Mirror World was a projection of the real world, and everything that could be seen in the Mirror World would definitely exist in the real Fifth Dimension in material form. The Tekuja Arena was a reflection of the Heavenly King Planet. A powerful level-7 civilization had once lived there and passed down fragments of Buddhism. They could have completely rivaled the present Titan Race. When they were at their peak, they even had the strength to challenge a level-8 civilization. However, it was a pity that they had disappeared in a mysterious battle that involved the Heaven several dozen eras ago.Meanwhile, Mo Wen had comprehended Buddhism from some wall drawings in this tattered arena. “Buddhism is broad and deep. What I have understood and learned is no more than the tip of the iceberg…”He was feeling slightly sentimental. “Wang Zhong, when you have the time, perhaps you can come here and comprehend this. This is a kind of deep reading that is different from the eleven origin laws in the world. Perhaps this will surprisingly be of help when you break through to the Gold Core Realm.”</p> </div> </div> <div class="row turn-page"> <a class="col-xs-2" href="/Battle%20Frenzy/1207.html?v=1662299020505">Previous</a> <a class="col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:center;" href="/Battle%20Frenzy/book.html?v=1662299020504">Table</a> <a class="col-xs-2 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:right;" href="/Battle%20Frenzy/1209.html?v=1662299020505"> Next</a> </div> <hr></div><hr><footer class="container"> <p>© Company 2014</p></footer><amp-lightbox id="searchLightbox" class="-il" layout="nodisplay" on="lightboxOpen:searchInput.focus; lightboxClose:searchTriggerOpen.focus" scrollable="" hidden="hidden"> <div> <div class="-ic" role="button" tabindex="0" on="tap:searchLightbox.close"></div> <div class="-ih"> <div class="-sg -sb" on="tap: searchLightbox.close, AMP.setState({ query: '' }), searchForm.clear" role="button" tabindex="0"> <div class="ap-a-ico -sw"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#close"></use> </svg> </div> </div> <div class="ap-o-search-field"> <form action="#" action-xhr="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/echo" class="-ip" id="searchForm" on="submit:AMP.setState({ query: throttledValue }),searchResult.focus" target="_top"> <amp-autocomplete class="-id" filter="substring" min-characters="1" on="select:AMP.setState({ query: event.value })" submit-on-enter="false" src="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/autosuggest"> <div class="ap-a-ico -im"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#search"></use> </svg> </div> <input id="searchInput" class="-iv" name="q" placeholder="What are you looking for?" on="input-throttled:AMP.setState({ throttledValue: event.value })" required=""> <button class="-ig" type="submit" name="search-submit" disabled="" [disabled]="!throttledValue">Search </button> <div role="listbox"></div> </amp-autocomplete> </form> <div class="empty" [class]="query ?
