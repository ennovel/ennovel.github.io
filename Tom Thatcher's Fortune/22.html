A ROUGH DIAMOND.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      “RATHER a rough fellow that,” said Percy Burnett, as he resumed his seat beside Tom.
<br> 
<br> “Yes, sir.”
<br> 
<br> “A rough diamond, I call him,” said Burnett.
<br> 
<br> Perhaps he saw by Tom’s face that his friend had not struck his young secretary as a diamond, rough or otherwise, for he proceeded:
<br> 
<br> “He has sterling qualities, Jack has, and an excellent heart. He is not refined, I grant. Indeed, he is rather coarse—never moved in good society, but he’ll stand by a friend through thick and thin. Why, he once watched beside my sick bed, when I had a fever, day and night, and wouldn’t leave me till I was out of danger.”
<br> 
<br> “That was very kind,” Tom was forced to admit.
<br> 
<br> “Yes, I shall never forget it. We became very intimate. You may have noticed that he called me Jim?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, I did.”
<br> 
<br> “The fact is, he took a dislike to the name of Percy. I believe he had been injured by some party of that name. So he asked if he might call me Jim, and I consented. Names don’t matter much if the heart’s in the right place.”
<br> 
<br> 127
<br> 
<br> “No, I suppose not,” answered Tom, who was satisfied with the explanation.
<br> 
<br> “I haven’t seen Jack for a good while,” said Mr. Burnett, “and he was curious to know what I was doing. He expressed himself rather oddly.”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, sir.”
<br> 
<br> “The fact is, Tom—and I suppose you may have guessed—I am a dealer in watches and jewelry. I was in business in Cincinnati till recently, but decided to remove to San Francisco, upon learning that there is an excellent opening there for a man in my business. A small part of my stock I have in the satchel which you are carrying. Did you ever think of learning the jewelry business?”
<br> 
<br> “No, I never thought of it,” Tom replied.
<br> 
<br> “When we get to San Francisco I may be able to offer you inducements.”
<br> 
<br> “I shall want to travel about the State a little first,” said Tom. “Thank you for the offer, though.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, well, I shall be in a hurry. Will you go to the mines?”
<br> 
<br> “I think so.”
<br> 
<br> “Perhaps I may go, too. I have never been in any mining district, and I have a curiosity to see what it looks like. Will you have a cigar?”
<br> 
<br> “No, thank you.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, I forgot you don’t smoke. I suppose I must go into the smoking-car—be back soon.”
<br> 
<br> The reader may have a curiosity to know what passed between Percy Burnett and his friend, the rough diamond, when they left the car together.
<br> 
<br> 128 “Who’s that boy you’ve got with you, Jim?” asked Jack.
<br> 
<br> “A young man who is under my guardianship,” said Mr. Burnett, hesitating.
<br> 
<br> Jack laughed.
<br> 
<br> “A pretty sort of guardian you’ll make,” he said, winking at his friend.
<br> 
<br> “Don’t speak so loud, Jack. You’ll attract attention.”
<br> 
<br> “And that’s just what you don’t want, I reckon.”
<br> 
<br> “Well, yes, if you will have it so.”
<br> 
<br> “Come, now, tell me what’s your game anyhow? Is the boy rich?”
<br> 
<br> “No.”
<br> 
<br> “Then what good can he do you?”
<br> 
<br> “He has a little money,” said Percy Burnett, cautiously.
<br> 
<br> “It won’t be his long, then.”
<br> 
<br> “You wrong me—indeed, you do. I am taking him out as far as Salt Lake City, and my expenses are to be paid by his friends.”
<br> 
<br> This was the best story that Mr. Burnett could devise upon the spur of the moment.
<br> 
<br> “All I can say is that his friends can’t know much about you. You didn’t mention to them the term you had served in——”
<br> 
<br> “Hush!” said Burnett, looking about him in alarm. “Don’t you know any better than to blurt out such things where people may hear?”
<br> 
<br> “Well, I’ll keep mum for your sake.”
<br> 
<br> 129 “Do so, and I’ll make it worth your while, Jack.”
<br> 
<br> “When?”
<br> 
<br> “When I return to St. Joe.”
<br> 
<br> “When will that be?”
<br> 
<br> “Before long.”
<br> 
<br> “No, it won’t, if you go all the way to Salt Lake City.”
<br> 
<br> “Perhaps I may not go all the way there,” said Percy, in a low voice.
<br> 
<br> “Oh, I see!” responded Jack, winking. “I begin to see your game.”
<br> 
<br> “You were always a shrewd, long-headed fellow, Jack.”
<br> 
<br> “So I am,” said Jack, evidently gratified by the praise.
<br> 
<br> “Of course, when I am in funds——”
<br> 
<br> “As you expect to be before long.”
<br> 
<br> “Well, as I expect to be before long, if you don’t interfere with my plans. I shall remember my friends.”
<br> 
<br> “Enough said! Now, honor bright! how soon do you expect to get back to St. Joe?”
<br> 
<br> “Perhaps in two or three days.”
<br> 
<br> “You won’t bring the boy back with you?”
<br> 
<br> “Not if he wants to go on.”
<br> 
<br> “I say, Jim, I’m hard up. Let me have five dollars now.”
<br> 
<br> “I assure you, Jack, I am not in a situation to part with any money just now.”
<br> 
<br> “I must have it,” said Jack, significantly.
<br> 
<br> “Oh, well, if you must,” and Mr. Percy Burnett130 drew it from his vest pocket, and reluctantly put it into the hand of the “rough diamond.”
<br> 
<br> “It’s rough luck meeting that fellow!” he muttered as he returned to his young secretary, “I was hoping I should not meet a soul that knew me till this job was fairly off my hands. Jack is always hard up, but it wasn’t safe to refuse him. I must not allow him to have any conversation with the boy. I will take care to steer clear of him when I come back this way.”
<br> 
<br> It was clear that Mr. Percy Burnett was not so much attached to the “rough diamond” as he led Tom to suppose.
