TOM STARTS ON HIS JOURNEY.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      TOM CALLED at the office of Samuel Perkins, in Pearl Street, as requested by that gentleman.
<br> 
<br> “Well, my young friend, are you ready to go to California?” asked the merchant.
<br> 
<br> “Yes, sir.”
<br> 
<br> “You would rather go than enter my employment?”
<br> 
<br> “Just at present, sir, I have a particular reason for wishing to go to California. Whenever I return I will call on you, and if you should then have a vacancy I should like to fill it.”
<br> 
<br> “Good! Have you a watch?”
<br> 
<br> “No, sir.”
<br> 
<br> “I thought not.”
<br> 
<br> Mr. Perkins opened the drawer of his desk, and took out a neat gold watch, of Waltham manufacture, and handed it to Tom.
<br> 
<br> “You will find that useful, I fancy,” he said.
<br> 
<br> “Is this for me?” asked Tom, amazed.
<br> 
<br> “It was purchased expressly for you,” said the merchant.
<br> 
<br> Now there was no possession that Tom so much coveted as that of a watch, and he thanked Mr. Perkins heartily.
<br> 
<br> “No thanks are required, my young friend,” said the114 merchant. “I am still much in your debt for the return of my papers.”
<br> 
<br> “If I hadn’t returned them after you had given me the overcoat I should have been a rascal,” said Tom, warmly.
<br> 
<br> “Still it was a temptation. At any rate, you are heartily welcome to the watch. I have prepared a letter to a friend of mine—a business man—in San Francisco, which I will get you to deliver whenever you reach there.”
<br> 
<br> “Is it important?” asked Tom. “It may be months before I get there.”
<br> 
<br> “It can wait till you reach the city. And now, my young friend, as I am writing letters to go to Europe by to-morrow’s steamer, I must ask you to excuse me. Give me your hand. I wish you all sorts of good luck. Good-by! Don’t forget to report to me whenever you come back to New York.”
<br> 
<br> The very first thing Tom did when he reached the street was to look at his new watch. He regarded it with pride and satisfaction, and I will not venture to say how many times he took it out during the first twenty-four hours. Attached to it was a plain gold chain. Opening it Tom saw that his name was engraved inside. This made it all the more desirable.
<br> 
<br> “I wish mother and Tillie could see my new watch,” he thought. “I’ve a great mind to go up to Wilton this afternoon and show it to them.”
<br> 
<br> But on second thoughts he decided not to do this. It would only render necessary a second leave-taking, and115 this would be painful. He decided that it was better to get started as soon as possible on his trip to the Pacific coast.
<br> 
<br> There were two ways to go to California—across the continent, or by steamer via Panama. Tom was somewhat in doubt upon which to decide. The shortest route would be by steamship, for at that period the union Pacific Railroad had not been built, or even commenced. If Tom had been in haste he would have decided in favor of the steamer, but he was in no especial hurry; besides, he thought there would be a possibility of finding some employment or agency which would pay a part of his expenses, if he went by land. He was also influenced in part by a desire to see the broad plains and prairies of the far West, and he had no objection to a few adventures on the way. It was not quite so easy or safe to go to California in those days. On the way were hostile Indians, desperate adventurers, highwaymen, and a chance of being snowed up in the winter season.
<br> 
<br> After some inquiry, therefore, Tom decided to buy a ticket to St. Louis, and when he arrived there take a short time to study the route and arrange his subsequent plans. Possibly he might secure some business commission or agency there, which would enable him to pay a part or the whole of his traveling expenses.
