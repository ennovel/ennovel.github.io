A FRIEND IN NEED.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      IT IS NOT to be supposed that Tom was indifferent to the sudden appearance of one who seemed sent by heaven to his help.
<br> 
<br> He looked eagerly in the direction of the new comer. The honest face and sturdy figure were not unknown to him.
<br> 
<br> “It is Mr. Brush!” he exclaimed joyfully.
<br> 
<br> “Yes,” said that individual, approaching, “it is Peter Brush. What has this rascal been up to?”
<br> 
<br> “Take care how you call me names, you clodhopper!” exclaimed Burnett, furiously, by no means pleased to see the man he had striven so hard to avoid.
<br> 
<br> “I may be a clodhopper, but I am not a scoundrel and a thief!” returned Brush.
<br> 
<br> Burnett felt that he was in a tight place. Would it be possible to deceive Mr. Brush? At any rate, he decided to try it.
<br> 
<br> “Sir,” he said forcibly, controlling his temper, “you are mistaken. I don’t blame you, for you are misled by what you have just seen.”
<br> 
<br> “If I am mistaken, perhaps you will explain why you have bound that boy, and taken his money and watch?”
<br> 
<br> “The boy is a thief, and has cheated me.”
<br> 149
<br> Peter Brush releases Tom from the hands of the robber.
<br> [Page 149.]
<br> 
<br> 150 “What!” exclaimed Tom, his eyes flashing.
<br> 
<br> “Wait a minute,” said Brush.
<br> 
<br> He stepped up to our hero, and drawing a knife, severed the cords that bound him, while Percy Burnett looked on in annoyance.
<br> 
<br> “Now, Tom,” said Brush, “what have you got to say to this charge?”
<br> 
<br> “I say it’s a lie!” asserted Tom boldly.
<br> 
<br> “Take care, you young rascal!” exclaimed Burnett, making a step toward our hero, now on his feet.
<br> 
<br> “Easy, now,” said Peter Brush. “The boy’s under my protection. Let him alone!”
<br> 
<br> “The boy’s in my employment,” said Burnett, “and I’ll thank you not to interfere.”
<br> 
<br> “I shall interfere all the same, if I think it necessary,” said Brush, composedly.
<br> 
<br> “I am not in your employment,” said Tom, facing Burnett. “I’ve had enough of your service.”
<br> 
<br> “You say the boy is a thief,” continued Brush. “Can you prove it?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, he managed to pick my pocket of a considerable sum of money, which he has now in his possession.”
<br> 
<br> “Don’t believe him, Mr. Brush,” said Tom.
<br> 
<br> “Easy now, Tom. How large a sum of money?” asked Brush.
<br> 
<br> That was just what Burnett could not tell, not knowing how much Tom had in his possession.
<br> 
<br> “I can’t say exactly. It’s over a hundred dollars,” he said, after a pause.
<br> 
<br> 151 “How about the watch? Did you have two?” for Burnett had one of his own besides the one he had taken from Tom.
<br> 
<br> “No; the watch belongs to the boy.”
<br> 
<br> “Yet you took it?”
<br> 
<br> “Precisely. I took it in part compensation for the money of which he had robbed me.”
<br> 
<br> “But you have the money, too.”
<br> 
<br> “Who are you, anyway, and what business have you to interfere between me and my servant?” burst forth Burnett, angrily, finding himself cornered.
<br> 
<br> “Your servant!” said Tom, proudly. “I am not your servant, nor anybody’s servant.”
<br> 
<br> “That’s a fact, Tom,” said Mr. Brush. “This fellow ought to be your servant.”
<br> 
<br> “If you are going to insult me, I’ll leave you,” said Burnett, suiting the action to the word.
<br> 
<br> “Come back, you thief!” cried Brush, covering him with his rifle.
<br> 
<br> “Do you mean to murder me?” asked Percy Burnett, alarmed.
<br> 
<br> “No, but there’s a little formality you must go through before you bid us good-by.”
<br> 
<br> “What is that?”
<br> 
<br> “Hand over the boy’s watch and money.”
<br> 
<br> “There’s the watch,” said Burnett, giving it back with an ill grace. “The money is mine and I will keep it.”
<br> 
<br> “I don’t think you will,” said Brush, composedly.
<br> 
<br> “I will have you arrested for highway robbery,” exclaimed Burnett, angrily.
<br> 
<br> 152 “I don’t think you will find any one to believe you, Jim Dobson.”
<br> 
<br> Burnett started, and a look of dismay overspread his face.
<br> 
<br> “My name is Percy Burnett,” he said, haughtily, recovering himself.
<br> 
<br> “Is it? It used to be Jim Dobson, well known to the police of Chicago, Cincinnati and St. Louis. You were recognized at St. Joe. Now will you hand over the money?”
<br> 
<br> With a muttered curse Burnett, alias Dobson, threw Tom’s pocket-book on the ground.
<br> 
<br> “Now I suppose I may go,” he said, sullenly.
<br> 
<br> “When the boy has examined his wallet to see if the money’s all there.”
<br> 
<br> “I know it is,” said Tom, “he hasn’t had time to open it.”
<br> 
<br> “Then you can go, Mr. Dobson. Good-by! Take my advice and lead a better life in the future.”
<br> 
<br> “Curse your advice!” said Burnett, as he strode rapidly away, leaving Tom and his new friend together in the gathering darkness.
