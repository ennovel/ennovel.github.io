To Keineth it seemed like a fortune!</p> 
<p>She had never thought much about money. She knew some people were very poor--she had often felt sorry for them as she watched them near the Square in New York. And she knew some were very rich, for Aunt Josephine talked of them. She had always had all the money she wanted, because she had never wanted very much. She supposed Peggy and the others had all they wanted, too. Each week Mr. Lee gave to each one of them a small allowance and whenever they managed to save anything from this each of them put it in her bank. Keineth supposed that the Lees were not as rich as Aunt Josephine and not as poor as Francesca's family next door to her old home, but it didn't seem to matter at all, because she did not think that the Lees wanted to be rich, anyway. They never talked of anything in terms of dollars and cents! Twenty-five dollars--that seemed enough to Keineth to buy everything anyone could want!</p> 
<p>Keineth and Peggy had carefully kept the precious secret of the "Castle of Dreams." For a few weeks they had watched the mail each day, then the holiday fun had filled their minds and the secret was forgotten. As the weeks passed and Keineth heard nothing she had almost given up all hope of selling her music and her great ambitions had taken a sad fall. Peggy had urged her to consult her music master about it, but after one or two attempts Keineth found she had not the courage.</p> 
<p>And now a check had come! Twenty-five whole dollars!</p> 
<p>"Peggy! Peggy!" she called, unable to wait one moment to share the good news.</p> 
<p>It was a very excited family that listened to their story at dinner time. Even Billy, red-eyed, forgot his own sorrow. Everyone had to hold the check and read it! Then each one suggested some way for Keineth to spend her money!</p> 
<p>And as is the way with all fortunes, sooner or later they become a burden! Already, even while they made merry over the check, Keineth was beginning to worry as to what she should do with it! Of course Mr. Lee had advised her putting it in the bank, but that did not seem like much fun! If Daddy were at home she would buy something for him with it or she might send it to Tante to help the poor children that were suffering from the war.</p> 
<p>"Give it to the Red Cross!" Peggy suggested grandly.</p> 
<p>"Buy a bicycle!" said Alice, "or one of those cunning electric stoves that we can cook on!"</p> 
<p>"If I had it I'd buy Pilot!" put in Billy sadly.</p> 
<p>"I'd like to do something with it," said Keineth slowly, "that would make somebody just awfully happy, because--" She looked down the length of the table and realized suddenly how dear to her these Lees had grown and what this home was to her. "Because I'm so happy here!"</p> 
<p>And even while she was speaking she decided just what she would do! But she would tell no one, not even Peggy!</p> 
<p>She would buy Pilot for Billy! Mrs. Lee had said they could not afford it! What good luck that her check had come just at the right time! After dinner she searched for and found the old man's card. It was soiled and crumpled from Billy's angry fingers. She hid it away with the check. She must wait until Monday.</p> 
<p>Keineth had to ride on the street-car a very long way before she reached the address which the card gave. Then she found herself before a great iron fence and had to ring twice before the big gate in the fence opened. It opened quite by itself and it clanged shut behind her, startling her with its noise. There seemed to be a million steps leading to the big bronze door and her feet moved like tons of lead! She had to ring again. The door swung back and a sour-faced man in dark livery faced her.</p> 
<p>"Is--is Mr. Grandison at home?" she asked in a voice so strange that she scarcely recognized it herself.</p> 
<p>The sour-faced man looked very hard at her.</p> 
<p>"Who is it, miss?" he asked wonderingly, as though few people came to that door for Mr. Grandison.</p> 
<p>"I'm Keineth Randolph. I must see him, please!" "He never sees anyone, miss, but you can go in. Only I wouldn't advise you to bother him very much because he's bad this morning with his rheumatism!"</p> 
<p>He was telling her this in a whisper as he led her through the long hall. Keineth thought it quite the longest, widest hall she had ever seen and she walked very fast past the big doors that opened into dark empty rooms that looked like great caverns! If a giant, bending his great head, had leaped through one of the heavy door-frames she would have thought it quite to be expected!</p> 
<p>The servant drew back a door and Keineth saw a long room full of books. At the other end, close to a table, sat an old, old man. Then she saw something move suddenly and Pilot dashed at her from a corner and leaped upon her with great whimpering, licking her hands and face and even her shoes.</p> 
<p>"What's this? Come here, Jacky! Who are you? Who let you in here?" roared the old man, glaring at Keineth.</p> 
<p>Keineth, terribly frightened, advanced slowly towards him, one hand on the dog's head. "I live at the bees' where you found Pilot. We all miss him so terribly, especially Billy, that I came to buy him back!"</p> 
<p>"You did, did you? Well, nobody has money enough to buy him."</p> 
<p>Keineth was so indignant at his disagreeable manner that she forgot her fright.</p> 
<p>"I know the Lees haven't money enough, because they have so many children and buy lots of things for them and give them a good time! But I'm going to buy Pilot for them! I know Pilot couldn't be happy here, anyway, it's so--so big and horrid and you're so--cross--after having a happy home with the Lees!"</p> 
<p>Pilot, as though to tell her that was very true, snuggled his nose under her arm and wagged his tail.</p> 
<p>"I've got twenty-five dollars," finished Keineth triumphantly, "and I can spend all of it because I earned it myself--writing music!"</p> 
<p>He turned and looked hard at her. Her fury seemed to have amused him.</p> 
<p>"Music--you write music! A child like you!"</p> 
<p>Keineth stepped closer to him. "Yes. Do you like music?"</p> 
<p>The old man answered very slowly. "It was all I cared for once upon a time! Let me see your eyes!" He reached out a wrinkled hand and drew her towards him. "They are blue--like hers were! Child, years and years ago I loved a young girl very much--and she taught me to love music! But she went out of my life and left me with nothing but loneliness!"</p> 
<p>Keineth thought of the great empty house and felt very sorry for him.</p> 
<p>"What was her name?" she asked softly.</p> 
<p>"A pretty name--like she was!" he muttered, his eyes fastened on the child's face. It was as if something he saw there was awakening the memories. "It was Keineth."</p> 
<p>"Why, that is my name!"</p> 
<p>"Keineth--Keineth what?" he cried.</p> 
<p>"Keineth Randolph."</p> 
<p>"You are John Randolph's girl--her son's girl."</p> 
<p>"You mean my grandmother? That--lady--you loved was my daddy's mother?"</p> 
<p>The old man was half laughing, half crying. He held Keineth's arms with his trembling fingers.</p> 
<p>"Of course--the same blue eyes--and music! How your grandmother loved music! How her fingers could play, make sounds that'd tear the heart right out of you!" He shook his head. "And she wouldn't have me--my money couldn't buy her! After she died I stood in the Square and watched them take her away from the house--saw the flowers I had sent go with her! I saw the man she had chosen instead of me walk out, too. He had two children by the hand--the little fellow was your father. I went away from New York then--" He drew his hands across his eyes as though to brush away the haunting pictures. "And you're Keineth!" he finished.</p> 
<p>Keineth told him of her daddy and of her coming from New York to live with the Lees until her father returned. She had almost forgotten Pilot in her deep sympathy for this lonely old man who had loved her father's mother--and had loved her for so many, many years! But Pilot suddenly barked!</p> 
<p>"Pilot thinks he belongs to us because he once saved my life," Keineth explained, going on, then, to tell the story of her narrow escape from drowning. Perhaps the old man heard her, though his face still wore a far-away look as if he had not yet been able to bring himself back from that dear past the child's eyes had awakened.</p> 
<p>"And so I'd like to buy him, please," Keineth finished, laying her check before him.</p> 
<p>For a long time the old man stared at it, while Keineth and Pilot waited.</p> 
<p>"He loves you better than he does me! You're right--he wasn't happy here--he's cried and cried! I can't keep even a dog's love! Take him." He slowly lifted the check, read it, turned it over, folded it and put it in his pocket.</p> 
<p>Then Keineth felt very sorry for the old man. She felt, too, that now in some way or other he belonged to her, though not exactly related.</p> 
<p>"Won't you come home to lunch with me? Then you can meet Peggy and the others and see how glad they are to get Pilot back! They'll be awfully glad to see you, really! Please don't be lonely any more--for--I'll be your friend!"</p> 
<p>He had risen slowly to his feet, towering over her. He looked down at the bright face. Keineth slipped her hand into his.</p> 
<p>"Oh, please come--it'll be such fun," and she gave his fingers a coaxing, friendly squeeze.</p> 
<p>The sour-faced servant muttered, "Well, I never!" under his breath, when he saw his master walk through the door to his waiting car, holding the little girl's hand and listening to her chatter with a smile! It was the strangest sight he had ever beheld in this very strange house!</p> 
<p>But it was a stranger sight for the Lees when the big limousine drew up at their curb and Pilot dashed from its door, followed by Keineth and a very, very old man who leaned one hand upon Keineth's shoulder.</p> 
<p>"Pilot!" cried Billy, who had seen them through the window.</p> 
<p>"And that old man!" echoed Peggy.</p> 
<p>In the hall Billy was on his knees with his arms around Pilot's neck.</p> 
<p>"Dear, dear old Pilot!" he was saying over and over.</p> 
<p>Mrs. Lee, concealing her amazement when Keineth quaintly introduced "my friend, Mr. Grandison," greeted him cordially and by her smile and gracious manner made the old man immediately feel at home. At the table she placed him between Keineth and Peggy, and Peggy found that he was not such a cross old man after all!</p> 
<p>"It's just like a story, Ken," she said after he had gone away and Keineth had given them an account of her morning's adventure. "You have found a fairy grandfather! But wasn't it scrumptious to see His Aged Grandness eating hash?"</p> 
<p>"Well, I guess Keineth's money has been well spent," added Mrs. Lee, looking fondly at the little girl. "For I think--besides making Billy very happy, it has opened a new life to a very lonely old man!"</p> 
<p>"I'll never forget what Ken has done," said Billy solemnly, as though he was taking a vow. "She's just all right and I'd like to see anyone that says she ain't!"</p> 
<p>"Billy--your English!" pleaded his mother.</p> 
<p>But Keineth blushed with pleasure. She knew she had won Billy's everlasting friendship! That evening a boy brought to the door a huge package addressed to Miss Keineth Randolph. It was a set of beautifully bound books, "The Lives of the Masters," and with them came a little note written in a queer, old-fashioned handwriting.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May these books give instruction, inspiration and courage to one whose feet are on the threshold. They are bought with the money you unselfishly spent to give a boy back his dog.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your devoted friend,</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WILFRED GRANDISON.</p>
