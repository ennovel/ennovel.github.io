<br> 
<br> “When is Marius going to wait on Rose?” asked the elder lady. “He has been home now two days.”
<br> 
<br> Susannah Chressham turned quickly.
<br> 
<br> “Rose is so occupied—since he hath gone into the Ministry, he is seldom at home.”
<br> 
<br> “It isn’t always service in the Ministry keeps him abroad,” remarked his mother lightly.
<br> 
<br> “Marius has been to his reception, you know,” said Miss Chressham, “and will call privately tomorrow.”
<br> 
<br> She came slowly down the centre of the room.
<br> 
<br> “It is nearly a year since Marius came home before,” she said; she seated herself near the Countess and her pink striped dress rustled against the other lady’s lavender muslins; the room was all white and pale colours, flowers were painted on the walls and Cupids smiled from the ceiling; the furniture was Aubusson, finely carved and of melting hues; the candles were scented and set in crystal sconces; in one corner stood an elegant spinet, and close by Susannah’s gold harp; on a tulip-wood table rested a beau-pot of forget-me-nots, the most vivid thing in the chamber.
<br> 
<br> “A year ago,” repeated the Countess vaguely; “yes, just before Rose married.”
<br> 
<br> “I was thinking of Lavinia,” said Miss Chressham quietly; “he has not seen her since.”
<br> 
<br> The Countess Agatha laughed.
<br> 
<br> “I expect he has forgotten her, my dear, certainly she has forgotten him.”
<br> 
<br> “I suppose so; but, just at first, it might be painful for them, and can one forget, like that?”
<br> 
<br> Miss Chressham took her musing face in her two fair hands and gazed absently at her own lovely reflection in the oval mirror opposite.
<br> 
<br> “Oh! my dear, you get too deep for me,” the Countess smiled prettily; “it was vastly sad at the time, but now everything moves along quite properly, and Lavinia has behaved very well.”
<br> 
<br> “She has acquired a manner,” responded Miss Chressham, “and she has been discreet.”
<br> 
<br> “Which is quite sufficient; but then you never liked her.”
<br> 
<br> “How could I? No, I dislike her, and her maid.”
<br> 
<br> “It is quite a pity,” answered the Countess, “for really I can discern no fault in her; of course she was wild at first, and difficult; and, of course, she is only middle-class at heart now, but she is not in any way openly discreditable; indeed, she passes very well for a lady of fashion.”
<br> 
<br> “That is not what I mean,” said Miss Chressham. “I think there is mischief in her, and mischief in that Honoria Pryse; and I think it may be difficult, with Marius.”
<br> 
<br> The Countess laughed; a habit with her that did not in the least imply that she was amused.
<br> 
<br> “I am sure you are wrong, Susannah,” she replied languidly. “Lavinia is merely bent on enjoying herself.”
<br> 
<br> “Well, I trust her not; she hath a quick sly way of questioning; the last time I saw her she was trying to discover from me what I knew of Selina Boyle.”
<br> 
<br> “Can you blame her if she is sometimes jealous?” asked the Countess.
<br> 
<br> Miss Chressham’s foot beat the delicate-hued carpet.
<br> 
<br> “But Rose has not seen Selina save in public since he married, and ’tis understood that it is to be a match between her and Sir Francis,” she answered impatiently. “And I know not how she can be jealous of one whom she doth not even pretend a regard for.”
<br> 
<br> “Well, you always thought Rose’s marriage a mistake,” remarked the elder lady placidly; she could not say she did, there was the money, and she had enjoyed it, was enjoying it, vastly.
<br> 
<br> Miss Chressham suddenly swerved from the subject.
<br> 
<br> “Selina and her father are coming to town; they have taken a house in Golden Square for the season. Sir Francis is delighted; I suppose they will be married this year.”
<br> 
<br> The Countess raised her delicate head and looked at the silver-gilt clock.
<br> 
<br> “Where has Marius gone, my dear; isn’t he late?”
<br> 
<br> Susannah was well used to reminding her aunt of things that lady knew perfectly well.
<br> 
<br> “He has gone to attend my Lord Willouby,” she smiled. “And I think he will be back very soon.”
<br> 
<br> “I recall it,” said the Countess Agatha. “Do you think he will be ordered abroad again?”
<br> 
<br> “Not to Madrid, I hope; he seems wearied of it to the death, doth he not?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes,” sighed his mother. “And I want to keep him at home; he spoke of an appointment in Paris, in the suite of my Lord Northcote; I trust he will not go.”
<br> 
<br> Miss Chressham rose.
<br> 
<br> “The mantua-maker is coming at six, shall we not go upstairs?”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, la!” cried my lady, shaking her laces into place; “it should be very modish, should it not, that watered tabby—which minds me that all the best heads have ribbon in the lapels—I wish to order some of a precise red.”
<br> 
<br> Susannah Chressham smiled, for the Countess Agatha spoke with more animation and decision than she had used when discussing her sons and their affairs.
<br> 
<br> The two ladies left the room; a few moments after their departure the timepiece struck six, and before the clear chimes had ceased Marius entered—Captain the Honourable Marius Lyndwood of the 2nd Buffs now, of a slightly weightier presence, a slightly quieter manner, otherwise not changed at all by his year in the train of the English ambassador in Spain.
<br> 
<br> He wore his buff and blue uniform, and his hair was powdered and rolled into stiff military side-curls; he moved with an air of precision that made him look older than he was. Finding the room empty he walked up and down idly a while, then stopped before the spinet and began turning over Susannah’s fragrant music-sheets. One took his fancy, he had been fond of music and not unskilled; this was a piece of Scarlatti, showy, foreign.
<br> 
<br> He sat down before the keyboard, making a clatter with his sword, and began to play; he laughed to himself at his own mistakes, and commenced whistling the air.
<br> 
<br> The white door opened and Miss Chressham entered; Marius rose, flushing a little, and both smiled.
<br> 
<br> “I thought you must have returned,” said Susannah, coming across the room. “Well, what of the Paris appointment?”
<br> 
<br> “The post has been offered me,” he answered rather gravely. “But my lord says it is as I wish; it can easily be arranged that I stay in London.”
<br> 
<br> “Are you going?” asked Miss Chressham.
<br> 
<br> He fixed his eyes on the keys.
<br> 
<br> “I think so.”
<br> 
<br> She moved away to the table that held the forget-me-nots and bent over them; then he looked at her, at the long fair curls flowing between her shoulders over her gleaming pink gown, and the slender hand hanging by her side.
<br> 
<br> “I want to do something worth while, Susannah,” he said quietly “to make a position for myself—this has all been Rose, Rose’s money.”
<br> 
<br> “I think you had better go,” she answered slowly, “though we miss you very much, Marius.”
<br> 
<br> He went suddenly pale.
<br> 
<br> “I want to thank you for writing to me so often,” he said abruptly. “If I go away will you still write to me?”
<br> 
<br> She faced him, smiling.
<br> 
<br> “Of course, Marius.”
<br> 
<br> He sat silent; she noticed his pallor and his serious mouth, and faintly wondered; he had been rather moody since his return.
<br> 
<br> “Well,” she said, “my lady sent me to see if you were here, that was all; we have the mantua-maker upstairs; but expect us at dinner!” she laughed.
<br> 
<br> “Can you not stay?” he demanded.
<br> 
<br> “Not now,” a touch of surprise was in her tone; “indeed I must go.”
<br> 
<br> Again he made no reply, and she smiled at him and left him.
<br> 
<br> Marius returned again to Scarlatti, swaying a little to the music, the long lace at his wrists sweeping the ivory keys; and again he was interrupted.
<br> 
<br> The servant opened the door.
<br> 
<br> “The Countess of Lyndwood.”
<br> 
<br> His brother’s wife stepped into the chamber and stood facing him; for a moment he did not know her; he received the impression of a slight dark lady, of a vivid personality, gorgeously dressed.
<br> 
<br> She wore black velvet, a large hat with black plumes, and a silver scarf; at her breast was a cluster of pink geranium; she appeared utterly out of harmony with the delicate taste of the chamber.
<br> 
<br> “Good evening, Captain Lyndwood,” she said.
<br> 
<br> He had not seen her since the Earl had turned her from the library at Lyndwood Holt, nearly a year ago; he opened his lips, but nothing came, and she laughed, pointing his silence.
<br> 
<br> “Are my lady and Miss Chressham out?” she asked, coming forward.
<br> 
<br> “They are upstairs, madam,” he answered, remaining standing by the spinet.
<br> 
<br> “Well, I can wait.” She moved slowly, trailing her heavy dress and revealing the fragile grace of her figure effectively and obviously; her hat was well tilted off her face, in her powdered hair was a knot of pink ribbon, and on her left cheek a black patch.
<br> 
<br> “Am I much changed?” she asked, and her eyes were slightly insolent.
<br> 
<br> “Yes,” said Marius in a troubled way. “I think you have changed, madam.”
<br> 
<br> She sank lightly into the gold chair by Susannah’s little work-table.
<br> 
<br> “Think! You know!” she cried; “but you are very much the same, Captain Lyndwood.”
<br> 
<br> He coloured furiously, and looked sternly at the page of music lying before him on the spinet.
<br> 
<br> “You must excuse me, madam,” he said formally, “that I have not yet waited on you. I am intending to visit Lyndwood House tomorrow.”
<br> 
<br> The Countess smiled.
<br> 
<br> “I heard of your return, from the Gazette; why did you not write to me?”
<br> 
<br> “My lord knew of my home-coming, madam,” he answered coldly.
<br> 
<br> “Do you imagine that I am in my lord’s confidence? I say I learnt it from the Gazette.”
<br> 
<br> There was no reply possible to her astonishing directness; her lately acquired manner of ease and presence but emphasised her graceless ignoring of the screen of words used by people of breed.
<br> 
<br> Marius looked at her; she was painted and powdered, beneath her gown showed her violet velvet shoe sparkling with a great diamond buckle; she leant forward a little, and gazed at him with eyes that were desperately unhappy; again she laughed.
<br> 
<br> “What were you playing?” she asked. “La! but I did not know that you were a player.”
<br> 
<br> “’Twas Scarlatti, madam,” he answered.
<br> 
<br> Their eyes met and she rose.
<br> 
<br> “I will play you something,” she said, and pulled off her grey gloves. “I am credited with some skill, Captain Lyndwood.”
<br> 
<br> He moved away from the spinet, mistrusting her, uneasy, the colour still in his fair face; he kept his eyes on her, noting how different she was, admitting her slender elegance and flaunting grace.
<br> 
<br> She played a little prelude, not looking at the notes but at him; then she glanced down at her slim hands and began to sing:
<br> 
<br> “I hung a bird in a wicker cage
<br> 
<br> To catch the morning sun,
<br> 
<br> And saw below the people rage
<br> 
<br> And press, and shout, and run,
<br> 
<br> To see her walk, her guards between,
<br> 
<br> With her face to the Maytime sun.”
<br> 
<br> Marius fingered his sword and walked up and down, but he was listening and she knew it.
<br> 
<br> “I was a clerk at a window, with learnèd books to write,
<br> 
<br> She was a Mary Martyr and sin in the Church’s sight.”
<br> 
<br> The Countess did not raise her eyes; she sang softly, and the words of the laboured incongruous song struck to the heart of her listener.
<br> 
<br> “The bird sang in his prison
<br> 
<br> To a captive daffodil,
<br> 
<br> That with the spring had risen,
<br> 
<br> In the pot on my window sill.
<br> 
<br> The sky was bright as a jewel
<br> 
<br> Through the trees on Tower Hill.
<br> 
<br> As her stainèd feet crept onward, I saw the people turn—
<br> 
<br> And I looked at the Mary Martyr whose body and soul must burn.
<br> 
<br> “Young was she and slender,
<br> 
<br> Lo! but a wondrous thing.
<br> 
<br> Her face was as full of splendour
<br> 
<br> As the primrose woods in spring,
<br> 
<br> When God bends through the branches,
<br> 
<br> To hear the mavis sing.
<br> 
<br> She was but a Mary Martyr, cursed for her heresy,
<br> 
<br> But her eyes were clear as water and troubled the heart in me.”
<br> 
<br> The Countess rose swiftly.
<br> 
<br> “Are you glad to be in London?” she said; she came towards him, swinging her gloves; he was aware of the perfume of her garments, of the heavy soft sound of her moving velvet.
<br> 
<br> “I think I am leaving again for Paris, madam,” he looked at her straightly. “Shall I not fetch Miss Chressham?”
<br> 
<br> “No,” answered Lady Lyndwood. “I came to see you. I learned from the mantua-maker she would be here at this hour. I chanced finding you alone.”
<br> 
<br> He thought her speech outrageous; his nostrils distended a little and his eyes darkened.
<br> 
<br> “You flatter me,” he said shortly.
<br> 
<br> She smiled.
<br> 
<br> “And now I have seen you, and you have nothing to say.”
<br> 
<br> “What should we have to say to one another, my lady?” His mouth set, and he frowned.
<br> 
<br> “Do not do that,” said the Countess suddenly. “You look like your brother.”
<br> 
<br> She moved to the work-table and picked up her gloves; he bit his lip and was silent.
<br> 
<br> The Countess spoke again.
<br> 
<br> “This is a beautiful room, is it not? This house cost my lord a vast sum—you Lyndwoods are very extravagant,” she drew her gauntlets on slowly. “I doubt if even a wealthy match can save you—the fortune of a merchant’s daughter has its limits—if the marriage were to last only as long as the money I were soon free.”
<br> 
<br> Marius turned to gaze at her.
<br> 
<br> “Do you mean to insult us?” he said in a goaded way.
<br> 
<br> She shrugged her shoulders.
<br> 
<br> “What do you think I mean?” her dark eyes held an unfathomable expression, one that could not fail to stir his blood with excitement, with wonder and confusion; she held her head very high and her complexion flushed beneath the rouge; “when we are all damned together each shall know perhaps what the other meant, not before.”
<br> 
<br> With an air of bright and deep passion she moved towards the door; it seemed that she would leave without another word, nor did he offer to detain her, though his curious gaze was eagerly on her; but abruptly she stopped and looked back.
<br> 
<br> “Are you not grown up yet, Marius?” she said wildly and softly.
<br> 
<br> He stood perfectly still and she held out her hand.
<br> 
<br> “Good-bye, Captain Lyndwood,” she said quietly. “I will not ask you to see me to my carriage.”
<br> 
<br> He began some hot reply, but was interrupted; Susannah Chressham entered.
<br> 
<br> “You, madam!” she said, sincerely surprised.
<br> 
<br> The Countess gave her a veiled glance.
<br> 
<br> “I am taking my departure, madam. I had a fancy to come in, but it is too late to stay.”
<br> 
<br> She lifted the heavy skirt off the twinkling paste on her shoes; certainly the most composed of the three.
<br> 
<br> “I sang to Captain Lyndwood!” actually she laughed; “and he never commended it! What are our gallants coming to? Good-night, madam; au revoir, sir.”
<br> 
<br> She curtsied and was gone.
<br> 
<br> Miss Chressham stared at her cousin.
<br> 
<br> “What is this, Marius? she has not been here for months; and the hour and the manner of her leaving!”
<br> 
<br> “I do not know anything of it,” said Marius shortly.
<br> 
<br> Miss Chressham crossed to the spinet.
<br> 
<br> “How dare she play my instrument!” the fair countenance was angry. “And come here in this manner to my lady’s house?”
<br> 
<br> “I do not know,” said Marius again, staring at the floor.
<br> 
<br> Susannah looked up at him sharply.
<br> 
<br> “I think you had better go to Paris,” she said slowly.
