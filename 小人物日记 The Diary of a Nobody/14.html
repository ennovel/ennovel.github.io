We spend a pleasant Christmasat Carrie's mother's. A Mr. Moss is rather too free. A boisterousevening, during which I am struck in the dark. I receive an extraordinaryletter from Mr. Mutlar, senior, respecting Lupin. We miss drinking outthe Old Year.</p> 
<p>　　December 24. - I am a poor man, but I would gladly give ten shillingsto find out who sent me the insulting Christmas card I received thismorning. I never insult people; why should they insult me? The worstpart of the transaction is, that I find myself suspecting all my friends.</p> 
<p>　　The handwriting on the envelope is evidently disguised, being writtensloping the wrong way. I cannot think either Gowing or Cummingswould do such a mean thing. Lupin denied all knowledge of it, and Ibelieve him; although I disapprove of his laughing and sympathising withthe offender. Mr. Franching would be above such an act; and I don'tthink any of the Mutlars would descend to such a course. I wonder if Pitt,that impudent clerk at the office, did it? Or Mrs. Birrell, the charwoman,or Burwin-Fosselton? The writing is too good for the former.</p> 
<p>　　Christmas Day. - We caught the 10.20 train at Paddington, and spent apleasant day at Carrie's mother's. The country was quite nice andpleasant, although the roads were sloppy. We dined in the middle of theday, just ten of us, and talked over old times. If everybody had a nice,UNinterfering mother-in-law, such as I have, what a deal of happinessthere would be in the world. Being all in good spirits, I proposed herhealth, and I made, I think, a very good speech.</p> 
<p>　　I concluded, rather neatly, by saying: "On an occasion like thiswhether relatives, friends, or acquaintances, - we are all inspired withgood feelings towards each other. We are of one mind, and think only oflove and friendship. Those who have quarrelled with absent friendsshould kiss and make it up. Those who happily have not fallen out, cankiss all the same." I saw the tears in the eyes of both Carrie and her mother, and must sayI felt very flattered by the compliment. That dear old Reverend JohnPanzy Smith, who married us, made a most cheerful and amusing speech,and said he should act on my suggestion respecting the kissing. He thenwalked round the table and kissed all the ladies, including Carrie. Ofcourse one did not object to this; but I was more than staggered when ayoung fellow named Moss, who was a stranger to me, and who hadscarcely spoken a word through dinner, jumped up suddenly with a sprigof misletoe, and exclaimed: "Hulloh! I don't see why I shouldn't be on inthis scene." Before one could realise what he was about to do, he kissedCarrie and the rest of the ladies.</p> 
<p>　　Fortunately the matter was treated as a joke, and we all laughed; but itwas a dangerous experiment, and I felt very uneasy for a moment as to theresult. I subsequently referred to the matter to Carrie, but she said: "Oh,he's not much more than a boy." I said that he had a very largemoustache for a boy. Carrie replied: "I didn't say he was not a niceboy."December 26. - I did not sleep very well last night; I never do in astrange bed. I feel a little indigestion, which one must expect at this timeof the year. Carrie and I returned to Town in the evening. Lupin camein late. He said he enjoyed his Christmas, and added: "I feel as fit as aLowther Arcade fiddle, and only require a little more 'oof' to feel as fit as a500 pounds Stradivarius." I have long since given up trying tounderstand Lupin's slang, or asking him to explain it.</p> 
<p>　　December 27. - I told Lupin I was expecting Gowing and Cummingsto drop in to-morrow evening for a quiet game. I was in hope the boywould volunteer to stay in, and help to amuse them. Instead of which, hesaid: "Oh, you had better put them off, as I have asked Daisy and FrankMutlar to come." I said I could not think of doing such a thing. Lupinsaid: "Then I will send a wire, and put off Daisy." I suggested that apost-card or letter would reach her quite soon enough, and would not be soextravagant.</p> 
<p>　　Carrie, who had listened to the above conversation with apparentannoyance, directed a well-aimed shaft at Lupin. She said: "Lupin, why do you object to Daisy meeting your father's friends? Is it because they arenot good enough for her, or (which is equally possible) SHE is not goodenough for them?" Lupin was dumbfounded, and could make no reply.</p> 
<p>　　When he left the room, I gave Carrie a kiss of approval.</p> 
<p>　　December 28 - Lupin, on coming down to breakfast, said to his mother:</p> 
<p>　　"I have not put off Daisy and Frank, and should like them to join Gowingand Cummings this evening." I felt very pleased with the boy for this.</p> 
<p>　　Carrie said, in reply: "I am glad you let me know in time, as I can turnover the cold leg of mutton, dress it with a little parsley, and no one willknow it has been cut." She further said she would make a few custards,and stew some pippins, so that they would be cold by the evening.</p> 
<p>　　Finding Lupin in good spirits, I asked him quietly if he really had anypersonal objection to either Gowing or Cummings. He replied: "Not inthe least. I think Cummings looks rather an ass, but that is partly due tohis patronising 'the three-and-six-one-price hat company,' and wearing areach-me-down frock-coat. As for that perpetual brown velveteen jacketof Gowing's - why, he resembles an itinerant photographer."I said it was not the coat that made the gentleman; whereupon Lupin,with a laugh, replied: "No, and it wasn't much of a gentleman who madetheir coats."We were rather jolly at supper, and Daisy made herself very agreeable,especially in the earlier part of the evening, when she sang. At supper,however, she said: "Can you make tee-to-tums with bread?" and shecommenced rolling up pieces of bread, and twisting them round on thetable. I felt this to be bad manners, but of course said nothing.</p> 
<p>　　Presently Daisy and Lupin, to my disgust, began throwing bread-pills ateach other. Frank followed suit, and so did Cummings and Gowing, tomy astonishment. They then commenced throwing hard pieces of crust,one piece catching me on the forehead, and making me blink. I said:</p> 
<p>　　"Steady, please; steady!" Frank jumped up and said: "Tum, tum; thenthe band played."I did not know what this meant, but they all roared, and continued thebread-battle. Gowing suddenly seized all the parsley off the cold mutton,and threw it full in my face. I looked daggers at Gowing, who replied:</p> 
<p>　　 "I say, it's no good trying to look indignant, with your hair full of parsley."I rose from the table, and insisted that a stop should be put to this fooleryat once. Frank Mutlar shouted: "Time, gentlemen, please! time!" andturned out the gas, leaving us in absolute darkness.</p> 
<p>　　I was feeling my way out of the room, when I suddenly received ahard intentional punch at the back of my head. I said loudly: "Who didthat?" There was no answer; so I repeated the question, with the sameresult. I struck a match, and lighted the gas. They were all talking andlaughing, so I kept my own counsel; but, after they had gone, I said toCarrie; "The person who sent me that insulting post-card at Christmas washere to-night."December 29. - I had a most vivid dream last night. I woke up, andon falling asleep, dreamed the same dream over again precisely. I dreamtI heard Frank Mutlar telling his sister that he had not only sent me theinsulting Christmas card, but admitted that he was the one who punchedmy head last night in the dark. As fate would have it, Lupin, at breakfast,was reading extracts from a letter he had just received from Frank.</p> 
<p>　　I asked him to pass the envelope, that I might compare the writing. Hedid so, and I examined it by the side of the envelope containing theChristmas card. I detected a similarity in the writing, in spite of theattempted disguise. I passed them on to Carrie, who began to laugh. Iasked her what she was laughing at, and she said the card was neverdirected to me at all. It was "L. Pooter," not "C. Pooter." Lupin askedto look at the direction and the card, and exclaimed, with a laugh: "Ohyes, Guv., it's meant for me."I said: "Are you in the habit of receiving insulting Christmas cards?"He replied: "Oh yes, and of SENDING them, too."In the evening Gowing called, and said he enjoyed himself very muchlast night. I took the opportunity to confide in him, as an old friend,about the vicious punch last night. He burst out laughing, and said:</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, it was YOUR HEAD, was it? I know I accidentally hit something,but I thought it was a brick wall." I told him I felt hurt, in both senses ofthe expression.</p> 
<p>　　December 30, Sunday. - Lupin spent the whole day with the Mutlars.</p> 
<p>　　 He seemed rather cheerful in the evening, so I said: "I'm glad to see youso happy, Lupin." He answered: "Well, Daisy is a splendid girl, but Iwas obliged to take her old fool of a father down a peg. What with hismeanness over his cigars, his stinginess over his drinks, his farthingeconomy in turning down the gas if you only quit the room for a second,writing to one on half-sheets of note-paper, sticking the remnant of the lastcake of soap on to the new cake, putting two bricks on each side of thefireplace, and his general 'outside-halfpenny-'bus-ness,' I was compelled tolet him have a bit of my mind." I said: "Lupin, you are not much morethan a boy; I hope you won't repent it."December 31. - The last day of the Old Year. I received anextraordinary letter from Mr. Mutlar, senior. He writes: "Dear Sir, - Fora long time past I have had considerable difficulty deciding the importantquestion, 'Who is the master of my own house? Myself, or YOUR SONLupin?' Believe me, I have no prejudice one way or the other; but I havebeen most reluctantly compelled to give judgment to the effect that I amthe master of it. Under the circumstances, it has become my duty toforbid your son to enter my house again. I am sorry, because it deprivesme of the society of one of the most modest, unassuming, and gentlemanlypersons I have ever had the honour of being acquainted with."I did not desire the last day to wind up disagreeably, so I said nothingto either Carrie or Lupin about the letter.</p> 
<p>　　A most terrible fog came on, and Lupin would go out in it, butpromised to be back to drink out the Old Year - a custom we have alwaysobserved. At a quarter to twelve Lupin had not returned, and the fog wasfearful. As time was drawing close, I got out the spirits. Carrie and Ideciding on whisky, I opened a fresh bottle; but Carrie said it smelt likebrandy. As I knew it to be whisky, I said there was nothing to discuss.</p> 
<p>　　Carrie, evidently vexed that Lupin had not come in, did discuss it all thesame, and wanted me to have a small wager with her to decide by thesmell. I said I could decide it by the taste in a moment. A silly andunnecessary argument followed, the result of which was we suddenly sawit was a quarter-past twelve, and, for the first time in our married life, wemissed welcoming in the New Year. Lupin got home at a quarter- past two, having got lost in the fog - so he said.</p>
