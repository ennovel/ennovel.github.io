We have a pleasant andquiet dinner at his uncle's, marred only by a few awkward mistakes on mypart respecting Mr. Finsworth's pictures. A discussion on dreams.</p> 
<p>　　April 27. - Kept a little later than usual at the office, and as I washurrying along a man stopped me, saying: "Hulloh! That's a face Iknow." I replied politely: "Very likely; lots of people know me,although I may not know them." He replied: "But you know meTeddy Finsworth." So it was. He was at the same school with me. Ihad not seen him for years and years. No wonder I did not know him!</p> 
<p>　　At school he was at least a head taller than I was; now I am at least a headtaller than he is, and he has a thick beard, almost grey. He insisted on myhaving a glass of wine (a thing I never do), and told me he lived atMiddlesboro', where he was Deputy Town Clerk, a position which was ashigh as the Town Clerk of London - in fact, higher. He added that he wasstaying for a few days in London, with his uncle, Mr. Edgar PaulFinsworth (of Finsworth and Pultwell). He said he was sure his unclewould be only too pleased to see me, and he had a nice house, WatneyLodge, only a few minutes' walk from Muswell Hill Station. I gave himour address, and we parted.</p> 
<p>　　In the evening, to my surprise, he called with a very nice letter fromMr. Finsworth, saying if we (including Carrie) would dine with them tomorrow (Sunday), at two o'clock, he would be delighted. Carrie did notlike to go; but Teddy Finsworth pressed us so much we consented.</p> 
<p>　　Carrie sent Sarah round to the butcher's and countermanded our half-leg ofmutton, which we had ordered for to- morrow.</p> 
<p>　　April 28, Sunday. - We found Watney Lodge farther off than weanticipated, and only arrived as the clock struck two, both feeling hot anduncomfortable. To make matters worse, a large collie dog pouncedforward to receive us. He barked loudly and jumped up at Carrie,covering her light skirt, which she was wearing for the first time, with mud. Teddy Finsworth came out and drove the dog off and apologised.</p> 
<p>　　We were shown into the drawing-room, which was beautifully decorated.</p> 
<p>　　It was full of knick-knacks, and some plates hung up on the wall. Therewere several little wooden milk- stools with paintings on them; also awhite wooden banjo, painted by one of Mr. Paul Finsworth's nieces - acousin of Teddy's.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Paul Finsworth seemed quite a distinguished-looking elderlygentleman, and was most gallant to Carrie. There were a great manywater-colours hanging on the walls, mostly different views of India, whichwere very bright. Mr. Finsworth said they were painted by "Simpz," andadded that he was no judge of pictures himself but had been informed ongood authority that they were worth some hundreds of pounds, althoughhe had only paid a few shillings apiece for them, frames included, at a salein the neighbourhood.</p> 
<p>　　There was also a large picture in a very handsome frame, done incoloured crayons. It looked like a religious subject. I was very muchstruck with the lace collar, it looked so real, but I unfortunately made theremark that there was something about the expression of the face that wasnot quite pleasing. It looked pinched. Mr. Finsworth sorrowfullyreplied: "Yes, the face was done after death - my wife's sister."I felt terribly awkward and bowed apologetically, and in a whisper saidI hoped I had not hurt his feelings. We both stood looking at the picturefor a few minutes in silence, when Mr. Finsworth took out a handkerchiefand said: "She was sitting in our garden last summer," and blew his noseviolently. He seemed quite affected, so I turned to look at something elseand stood in front of a portrait of a jolly-looking middle-aged gentleman,with a red face and straw hat. I said to Mr. Finsworth: "Who is thisjovial-looking gentleman? Life doesn't seem to trouble him much." Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Finsworth said: "No, it doesn't. HE IS DEAD TOO - my brother."I was absolutely horrified at my own awkwardness. Fortunately atthis moment Carrie entered with Mrs. Finsworth, who had taken herupstairs to take off her bonnet and brush her skirt. Teddy said: "Short islate," but at that moment the gentleman referred to arrived, and I wasintroduced to him by Teddy, who said: "Do you know Mr. Short?" replied, smiling, that I had not that pleasure, but I hoped it would not belong before I knew Mr. SHORT. He evidently did not see my little joke,although I repeated it twice with a little laugh. I suddenly remembered itwas Sunday, and Mr. Short was perhaps VERY PARTICULAR. In this Iwas mistaken, for he was not at all particular in several of his remarksafter dinner. In fact I was so ashamed of one of his observations that I tookthe opportunity to say to Mrs. Finsworth that I feared she found Mr. Shortoccasionally a little embarrassing. To my surprise she said: "Oh! he isprivileged you know." I did not know as a matter of fact, and so I bowedapologetically. I fail to see why Mr. Short should be privileged.</p> 
<p>　　Another thing that annoyed me at dinner was that the collie dog, whichjumped up at Carrie, was allowed to remain under the dining- room table.</p> 
<p>　　It kept growling and snapping at my boots every time I moved my foot.</p> 
<p>　　Feeling nervous rather, I spoke to Mrs. Finsworth about the animal, andshe remarked: "It is only his play." She jumped up and let in afrightfully ugly-looking spaniel called Bibbs, which had been scratching atthe door. This dog also seemed to take a fancy to my boots, and Idiscovered afterwards that it had licked off every bit of blacking fromthem. I was positively ashamed of being seen in them. Mrs. Finsworth,who, I must say, is not much of a Job's comforter, said: "Oh! we are usedto Bibbs doing that to our visitors."Mr. Finsworth had up some fine port, although I question whether it isa good thing to take on the top of beer. It made me feel a little sleepy,while it had the effect of inducing Mr. Short to become "privileged" torather an alarming extent. It being cold even for April, there was a fire inthe drawing-room; we sat round in easy-chairs, and Teddy and I waxedrather eloquent over the old school days, which had the effect of sendingall the others to sleep. I was delighted, as far as Mr. Short was concerned,that it did have that effect on him.</p> 
<p>　　We stayed till four, and the walk home was remarkable only for thefact that several fools giggled at the unpolished state of my boots.</p> 
<p>　　Polished them myself when I got home. Went to church in the evening,and could scarcely keep awake. I will not take port on the top of beeragain.</p> 
<p>　　 April 29. - I am getting quite accustomed to being snubbed by Lupin,and I do not mind being sat upon by Carrie, because I think she has acertain amount of right to do so; but I do think it hard to be at oncesnubbed by wife, son, and both my guests.</p> 
<p>　　Gowing and Cummings had dropped in during the evening, and Isuddenly remembered an extraordinary dream I had a few nights ago, andI thought I would tell them about it. I dreamt I saw some huge blocks ofice in a shop with a bright glare behind them. I walked into the shop andthe heat was overpowering. I found that the blocks of ice were on fire.</p> 
<p>　　The whole thing was so real and yet so supernatural I woke up in a coldperspiration. Lupin in a most contemptuous manner, said: "What utterrot."Before I could reply, Gowing said there was nothing so completelyuninteresting as other people's dreams.</p> 
<p>　　I appealed to Cummings, but he said he was bound to agree with theothers and my dream was especially nonsensical. I said: "It seemed soreal to me." Gowing replied: "Yes, to YOU perhaps, but not to US."Whereupon they all roared.</p> 
<p>　　Carrie, who had hitherto been quiet, said: "He tells me his stupiddreams every morning nearly." I replied: "Very well, dear, I promiseyou I will never tell you or anybody else another dream of mine thelongest day I live." Lupin said: "Hear! hear!" and helped himself toanother glass of beer. The subject was fortunately changed, andCummings read a most interesting article on the superiority of the bicycleto the horse.</p>
