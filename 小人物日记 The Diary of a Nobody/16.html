Lupin takes us for a drive, which wedon't enjoy. Lupin introduces us to Mr. Murray Posh.</p> 
<p>　　February 8. - It does seem hard I cannot get good sausages forbreakfast. They are either full of bread or spice, or are as red as beef.</p> 
<p>　　Still anxious about the 20 pounds I invested last week by Lupin's advice.</p> 
<p>　　However, Cummings has done the same.</p> 
<p>　　February 9. -Exactly a fortnight has passed, and I have neither seennor heard from Gowing respecting his extraordinary conduct in asking usround to his house, and then being out. In the evening Carrie wasengaged marking a half-dozen new collars I had purchased. I'll backCarrie's marking against anybody's. While I was drying them at the fire,and Carrie was rebuking me for scorching them, Cummings came in.</p> 
<p>　　He seemed quite well again, and chaffed us about marking the collars.</p> 
<p>　　I asked him if he had heard from Gowing, and he replied that he had not.</p> 
<p>　　I said I should not have believed that Gowing could have acted in such anungentlemanly manner. Cummings said: "You are mild in yourdescription of him; I think he has acted like a cad."The words were scarcely out of his mouth when the door opened, andGowing, putting in his head, said: "May I come in?" I said:</p> 
<p>　　"Certainly." Carrie said very pointedly: "Well, you ARE a stranger."Gowing said: "Yes, I've been on and off to Croydon during the lastfortnight." I could see Cummings was boiling over, and eventually hetackled Gowing very strongly respecting his conduct last Saturday week.</p> 
<p>　　Gowing appeared surprised, and said: "Why, I posted a letter to you in themorning announcing that the party was 'off, very much off.'" I said: "Inever got it." Gowing, turning to Carrie, said: "I suppose letterssometimes MISCARRY, don't they, MRS. Carrie?" Cummings sharplysaid: "This is not a time for joking. I had no notice of the party beingput off." Gowing replied: "I told Pooter in my note to tell you, as I wasin a hurry. However, I'll inquire at the post-office, and we must meet again at my place." I added that I hoped he would be present at the nextmeeting. Carrie roared at this, and even Cummings could not helplaughing.</p> 
<p>　　February 10, Sunday. - Contrary to my wishes, Carrie allowed Lupinto persuade her to take her for a drive in the afternoon in his trap. I quitedisapprove of driving on a Sunday, but I did not like to trust Carrie alonewith Lupin, so I offered to go too. Lupin said: "Now, that is nice of you,Guv., but you won't mind sitting on the back-seat of the cart?"Lupin proceeded to put on a bright-blue coat that seemed miles toolarge for him. Carrie said it wanted taking in considerably at the back.</p> 
<p>　　Lupin said: "Haven't you seen a box-coat before? You can't drive inanything else."He may wear what he likes in the future, for I shall never drive withhim again. His conduct was shocking. When we passed HighgateArchway, he tried to pass everything and everybody. He shouted torespectable people who were walking quietly in the road to get out of theway; he flicked at the horse of an old man who was riding, causing it torear; and, as I had to ride backwards, I was compelled to face a gang ofroughs in a donkey-cart, whom Lupin had chaffed, and who turned andfollowed us for nearly a mile, bellowing, indulging in coarse jokes andlaughter, to say nothing of occasionally pelting us with orange-peel.</p> 
<p>　　Lupin's excuse - that the Prince of Wales would have to put up with thesame sort of thing if he drove to the Derby - was of little consolation toeither Carrie or myself. Frank Mutlar called in the evening, and Lupinwent out with him.</p> 
<p>　　February 11. - Feeling a little concerned about Lupin, I mustered upcourage to speak to Mr. Perkupp about him. Mr. Perkupp has alwaysbeen most kind to me, so I told him everything, including yesterday'sadventure. Mr. Perkupp kindly replied: "There is no necessity for youto be anxious, Mr. Pooter. It would be impossible for a son of such goodparents to turn out erroneously. Remember he is young, and will soon getolder. I wish we could find room for him in this firm." The advice ofthis good man takes loads off my mind. In the evening Lupin came in.</p> 
<p>　　After our little supper, he said: "My dear parents, I have some news, which I fear will affect you considerably." I felt a qualm come over me,and said nothing. Lupin then said: "It may distress you - in fact, I'msure it will - but this afternoon I have given up my pony and trap for ever."It may seem absurd, but I was so pleased, I immediately opened a bottle ofport. Gowing dropped in just in time, bringing with him a large sheet,with a print of a tailless donkey, which he fastened against the wall. Hethen produced several separate tails, and we spent the remainder of theevening trying blindfolded to pin a tail on in the proper place. My sidespositively ached with laughter when I went to bed.</p> 
<p>　　February 12. - In the evening I spoke to Lupin about his engagementwith Daisy Mutlar. I asked if he had heard from her. He replied: "No;she promised that old windbag of a father of hers that she would notcommunicate with me. I see Frank Mutlar, of course; in fact, he said hemight call again this evening." Frank called, but said he could not stop,as he had a friend waiting outside for him, named Murray Posh, adding hewas quite a swell. Carrie asked Frank to bring him in.</p> 
<p>　　He was brought in, Gowing entering at the same time. Mr. MurrayPosh was a tall, fat young man, and was evidently of a very nervousdisposition, as he subsequently confessed he would never go in a hansomcab, nor would he enter a four-wheeler until the driver had first got on thebox with his reins in his hands.</p> 
<p>　　On being introduced, Gowing, with his usual want of tact, said: "Anyrelation to 'Posh's three-shilling hats'?" Mr. Posh replied: "Yes; butplease understand I don't try on hats myself. I take no ACTIVE part inthe business." I replied: "I wish I had a business like it." Mr. Poshseemed pleased, and gave a long but most interesting history of theextraordinary difficulties in the manufacture of cheap hats.</p> 
<p>　　Murray Posh evidently knew Daisy Mutlar very intimately from theway he was talking of her; and Frank said to Lupin once, laughingly: "Ifyou don't look out, Posh will cut you out!" When they had all gone, Ireferred to this flippant conversation; and Lupin said, sarcastically: "Aman who is jealous has no respect for himself. A man who would bejealous of an elephant like Murray Posh could only have a contempt forhimself. I know Daisy. She WOULD wait ten years for me, as I said before; in fact, if necessary, SHE WOULD WAIT TWENTY YEARS FORME."</p>
