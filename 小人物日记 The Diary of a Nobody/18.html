The dream of my liferealised. Mr. Perkupp takes Lupin into the office.</p> 
<p>　　March 20. -To-day being the day on which Daisy Mutlar and Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Murray Posh are to be married, Lupin has gone with a friend to spend theday at Gravesend. Lupin has been much cut-up over the affair, althoughhe declares that he is glad it is off. I wish he would not go to so manymusic-halls, but one dare not say anything to him about it. At the presentmoment he irritates me by singing all over the house some nonsense about"What's the matter with Gladstone? He's all right! What's the matterwith Lupin? He's all right!" I don't think either of them is. In theevening Gowing called, and the chief topic of conversation was Daisy'smarriage to Murray Posh. I said: "I was glad the matter was at an end,as Daisy would only have made a fool of Lupin." Gowing, with his usualgood taste, said: "Oh, Master Lupin can make a fool of himself withoutany assistance." Carrie very properly resented this, and Gowing hadsufficient sense to say he was sorry.</p> 
<p>　　March 21. - To-day I shall conclude my diary, for it is one of thehappiest days of my life. My great dream of the last few weeks - in fact,of many years - has been realised. This morning came a letter from Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Perkupp, asking me to take Lupin down to the office with me. I went toLupin's room; poor fellow, he seemed very pale, and said he had a badheadache. He had come back yesterday from Gravesend, where he spentpart of the day in a small boat on the water, having been mad enough toneglect to take his overcoat with him. I showed him Mr. Perkupp's letter,and he got up as quickly as possible. I begged of him not to put on hisfast-coloured clothes and ties, but to dress in something black or quiet-looking.</p> 
<p>　　Carrie was all of a tremble when she read the letter, and all she couldkeep on saying was: "Oh, I DO hope it will be all right." For myself, Icould scarcely eat any breakfast. Lupin came down dressed quietly, and looking a perfect gentleman, except that his face was rather yellow.</p> 
<p>　　Carrie, by way of encouragement said: "You do look nice, Lupin." Lupinreplied: "Yes, it's a good make- up, isn't it? A regular-downrightrespectable-funereal-first- class-City-firm-junior-clerk." He laughedrather ironically.</p> 
<p>　　In the hall I heard a great noise, and also Lupin shouting to Sarah tofetch down his old hat. I went into the passage, and found Lupin in afury, kicking and smashing a new tall hat. I said: "Lupin, my boy, whatare you doing? How wicked of you! Some poor fellow would be gladto have it." Lupin replied: "I would not insult any poor fellow bygiving it to him."When he had gone outside, I picked up the battered hat, and saw inside"Posh's Patent." Poor Lupin! I can forgive him. It seemed hoursbefore we reached the office. Mr. Perkupp sent for Lupin, who was withhim nearly an hour. He returned, as I thought, crestfallen in appearance.</p> 
<p>　　I said: "Well, Lupin, how about Mr. Perkupp?" Lupin commenced hissong: "What's the matter with Perkupp? He's all right!" I feltinstinctively my boy was engaged. I went to Mr. Perkupp, but I couldnot speak. He said: "Well, Mr. Pooter, what is it?" I must have looked afool, for all I could say was: "Mr. Perkupp, you are a good man." Helooked at me for a moment, and said: "No, Mr. Pooter, YOU are thegood man; and we'll see if we cannot get your son to follow such anexcellent example." I said: "Mr. Perkupp, may I go home? I cannotwork any more to-day."My good master shook my hand warmly as he nodded his head. Itwas as much as I could do to prevent myself from crying in the 'bus; infact, I should have done so, had my thoughts not been interrupted byLupin, who was having a quarrel with a fat man in the 'bus, whom heaccused of taking up too much room.</p> 
<p>　　In the evening Carrie sent round for dear old friend Cummings and hiswife, and also to Gowing. We all sat round the fire, and in a bottle of"Jackson Freres," which Sarah fetched from the grocer's, drank Lupin'shealth. I lay awake for hours, thinking of the future. My boy in thesame office as myself - we can go down together by the 'bus, come home together, and who knows but in the course of time he may take greatinterest in our little home. That he may help me to put a nail in here or anail in there, or help his dear mother to hang a picture. In the summer hemay help us in our little garden with the flowers, and assist us to paint thestands and pots. (By-the-by, I must get in some more enamel paint.)All this I thought over and over again, and a thousand happy thoughtsbeside. I heard the clock strike four, and soon after fell asleep, only todream of three happy people - Lupin, dear Carrie, and myself.</p>
