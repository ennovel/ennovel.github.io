Lupin'sopinion of 'Xmas. Lupin's unfortunate engagement is on again.</p> 
<p>　　December 17. - As I open my scribbling diary I find the words"Oxford Michaelmas Term ends." Why this should induce me to indulgein retrospective I don't know, but it does. The last few weeks of my diaryare of minimum interest. The breaking off of the engagement betweenLupin and Daisy Mutlar has made him a different being, and Carrie arather depressing companion. She was a little dull last Saturday, and Ithought to cheer her up by reading some extracts from my diary; but shewalked out of the room in the middle of the reading, without a word. Onher return, I said: "Did my diary bore you, darling?"She replied, to my surprise: "I really wasn't listening, dear. I wasobliged to leave to give instructions to the laundress. In consequence ofsome stuff she puts in the water, two more of Lupin's coloured shirts haverun and he says he won't wear them."I said: "Everything is Lupin. It's all Lupin, Lupin, Lupin. Therewas not a single button on my shirt yesterday, but I made no complaint."Carrie simply replied: "You should do as all other men do, and wearstuds. In fact, I never saw anyone but you wear buttons on the shirt-fronts."I said: "I certainly wore none yesterday, for there were none on."Another thought that strikes me is that Gowing seldom calls in theevening, and Cummings never does. I fear they don't get on well withLupin.</p> 
<p>　　December 18. - Yesterday I was in a retrospective vein - to-day it isPROSPECTIVE. I see nothing but clouds, clouds, clouds. Lupin isperfectly intolerable over the Daisy Mutlar business. He won't say whatis the cause of the breach. He is evidently condemning her conduct, andyet, if we venture to agree with him, says he won't hear a word against her.</p> 
<p>　　So what is one to do? Another thing which is disappointing to me is, that Carrie and Lupin take no interest whatever in my diary.</p> 
<p>　　I broached the subject at the breakfast-table to-day. I said: "I was inhopes that, if anything ever happened to me, the diary would be an endlesssource of pleasure to you both; to say nothing of the chance of theremuneration which may accrue from its being published."Both Carrie and Lupin burst out laughing. Carrie was sorry for this, Icould see, for she said: "I did not mean to be rude, dear Charlie; but trulyI do not think your diary would sufficiently interest the public to be takenup by a publisher."I replied: "I am sure it would prove quite as interesting as some ofthe ridiculous reminiscences that have been published lately. Besides, it'sthe diary that makes the man. Where would Evelyn and Pepys have beenif it had not been for their diaries?"Carrie said I was quite a philosopher; but Lupin, in a jeering tone, said:</p> 
<p>　　"If it had been written on larger paper, Guv., we might get a fair price froma butterman for it."As I am in the prospective vein, I vow the end of this year will see theend of my diary.</p> 
<p>　　December 19. - The annual invitation came to spend Christmas withCarrie's mother - the usual family festive gathering to which we alwayslook forward. Lupin declined to go. I was astounded, and expressedmy surprise and disgust. Lupin then obliged us with the followingRadical speech: "I hate a family gathering at Christmas. What does itmean? Why someone says: 'Ah! we miss poor Uncle James, who washere last year,' and we all begin to snivel. Someone else says: 'It's twoyears since poor Aunt Liz used to sit in that corner.' Then we all begin tosnivel again. Then another gloomy relation says 'Ah! I wonder whoseturn it will be next?' Then we all snivel again, and proceed to eat and drinktoo much; and they don't discover until I get up that we have been seatedthirteen at dinner."December 20. - Went to Smirksons', the drapers, in the Strand, whothis year have turned out everything in the shop and devoted the wholeplace to the sale of Christmas cards. Shop crowded with people, whoseemed to take up the cards rather roughly, and, after a hurried glance at them, throw them down again. I remarked to one of the young personsserving, that carelessness appeared to be a disease with some purchasers.</p> 
<p>　　The observation was scarcely out of my mouth, when my thick coat-sleevecaught against a large pile of expensive cards in boxes one on top of theother, and threw them down. The manager came forward, looking verymuch annoyed, and picking up several cards from the ground, said to oneof the assistants, with a palpable side-glance at me: "Put these amongstthe sixpenny goods; they can't be sold for a shilling now." The result was,I felt it my duty to buy some of these damaged cards.</p> 
<p>　　I had to buy more and pay more than intended. Unfortunately I didnot examine them all, and when I got home I discovered a vulgar cardwith a picture of a fat nurse with two babies, one black and the other white,and the words: "We wish Pa a Merry Christmas." I tore up the card andthrew it away. Carrie said the great disadvantage of going out in Societyand increasing the number of our friends was, that we should have to sendout nearly two dozen cards this year.</p> 
<p>　　December 21. - To save the postman a miserable Christmas, we followthe example of all unselfish people, and send out our cards early. Most ofthe cards had finger-marks, which I did not notice at night. I shall buy allfuture cards in the daytime. Lupin (who, ever since he has had theappointment with a stock and share broker, does not seem over-scrupulousin his dealings) told me never to rub out the pencilled price on the backs ofthe cards. I asked him why. Lupin said: "Suppose your card ismarked 9d. Well, all you have to do is to pencil a 3 - and a long downstroke after it - in FRONT of the ninepence, and people will think youhave given five times the price for it."In the evening Lupin was very low-spirited, and I reminded him thatbehind the clouds the sun was shining. He said: "Ugh! it never shineson me." I said: "Stop, Lupin, my boy; you are worried about DaisyMutlar. Don't think of her any more. You ought to congratulateyourself on having got off a very bad bargain. Her notions are far toogrand for our simple tastes." He jumped up and said: "I won't allowone word to be uttered against her. She's worth the whole bunch of yourfriends put together, that inflated, sloping-head of a Perkupp included." left the room with silent dignity, but caught my foot in the mat.</p> 
<p>　　December 23. - I exchanged no words with Lupin in the morning; butas he seemed to be in exuberant spirits in the evening, I ventured to askhim where he intended to spend his Christmas. He replied: "Oh, mostlikely at the Mutlars'."In wonderment, I said: "What! after your engagement has beenbroken off?"Lupin said: "Who said it is off?"I said: "You have given us both to understand - "He interrupted me by saying: "Well, never mind what I said. IT ISON AGAIN - THERE!"</p>
