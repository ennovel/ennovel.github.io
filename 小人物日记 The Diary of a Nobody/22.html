We are in great trouble. Lupin gets engagedelsewhere at a handsome salary.</p> 
<p>　　May 13. - A terrible misfortune has happened: Lupin is dischargedfrom Mr. Perkupp's office; and I scarcely know how I am writing my diary.</p> 
<p>　　I was away from office last Sat., the first time I have been absent throughillness for twenty years. I believe I was poisoned by some lobster. Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Perkupp was also absent, as Fate would have it; and our most valuedcustomer, Mr. Crowbillon, went to the office in a rage, and withdrew hiscustom. My boy Lupin not only had the assurance to receive him, butrecommended him the firm of Gylterson, Sons and Co. Limited. In myown humble judgment, and though I have to say it against my own son,this seems an act of treachery.</p> 
<p>　　This morning I receive a letter from Perkupp, informing me thatLupin's services are no longer required, and an interview with me isdesired at eleven o'clock. I went down to the office with an aching heart,dreading an interview with Mr. Perkupp, with whom I have never had aword. I saw nothing of Lupin in the morning. He had not got up whenit was time for me to leave, and Carrie said I should do no good bydisturbing him. My mind wandered so at the office that I could not domy work properly.</p> 
<p>　　As I expected, I was sent for by Mr. Perkupp, and the followingconversation ensued as nearly as I can remember it.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Perkupp said: "Good-morning, Mr. Pooter! This is a veryserious business. I am not referring so much to the dismissal of your son,for I knew we should have to part sooner or later. I am the head of thisold, influential, and much-respected firm; and when I consider the timehas come to revolutionise the business, I will do it myself."I could see my good master was somewhat affected, and I said: "Ihope, sir, you do not imagine that I have in any way countenanced myson's unwarrantable interference?" Mr. Perkupp rose from his seat and took my hand, and said: "Mr. Pooter, I would as soon suspect myself assuspect you." I was so agitated that in the confusion, to show mygratitude I very nearly called him a "grand old man."Fortunately I checked myself in time, and said he was a "grand oldmaster." I was so unaccountable for my actions that I sat down, leavinghim standing. Of course, I at once rose, but Mr. Perkupp bade me sitdown, which I was very pleased to do. Mr. Perkupp, resuming, said:</p> 
<p>　　"You will understand, Mr. Pooter, that the high- standing nature of ourfirm will not admit of our bending to anybody. If Mr. Crowbillonchooses to put his work into other hands - I may add, less experiencedhands - it is not for us to bend and beg back his custom." "You SHALLnot do it, sir," I said with indignation. "Exactly," replied Mr. Perkupp; "Ishall NOT do it. But I was thinking this, Mr. Pooter. Mr. Crowbillon isour most valued client, and I will even confess - for I know this will not gobeyond ourselves - that we cannot afford very well to lose him, especiallyin these times, which are not of the brightest. Now, I fancy you can be ofservice."I replied: "Mr. Perkupp, I will work day and night to serve you!"Mr. Perkupp said: "I know you will. Now, what I should like youto do is this. You yourself might write to Mr. Crowbillon - you must not,of course, lead him to suppose I know anything about your doing so - andexplain to him that your son was only taken on as a clerk - quite aninexperienced one in fact - out of the respect the firm had for you, Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pooter. This is, of course, a fact. I don't suggest that you should speakin too strong terms of your own son's conduct; but I may add, that had hebeen a son of mine, I should have condemned his interference with nomeasured terms. That I leave to you. I think the result will be that Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Crowbillon will see the force of the foolish step he has taken, and our firmwill neither suffer in dignity nor in pocket."I could not help thinking what a noble gentleman Mr. Perkupp is. Hismanners and his way of speaking seem to almost thrill one with respect.</p> 
<p>　　I said: "Would you like to see the letter before I send it?"Mr. Perkupp said: "Oh no! I had better not. I am supposed toknow nothing about it, and I have every confidence in you. You must write the letter carefully. We are not very busy; you had better take themorning to-morrow, or the whole day if you like. I shall be here myselfall day to-morrow, in fact all the week, in case Mr. Crowbillon shouldcall."I went home a little more cheerful, but I left word with Sarah that Icould not see either Gowing or Cummings, nor in fact anybody, if theycalled in the evening. Lupin came into the parlour for a moment with anew hat on, and asked my opinion of it. I said I was not in the mood tojudge of hats, and I did not think he was in a position to buy a new one.</p> 
<p>　　Lupin replied carelessly: "I didn't buy it; it was a present."I have such terrible suspicions of Lupin now that I scarcely like to askhim questions, as I dread the answers so. He, however, saved me thetrouble.</p> 
<p>　　He said: "I met a friend, an old friend, that I did not quite think afriend at the time; but it's all right. As he wisely said, 'all is fair in loveand war,' and there was no reason why we should not be friends still.</p> 
<p>　　He's a jolly, good, all-round sort of fellow, and a very different stamp fromthat inflated fool of a Perkupp."I said: "Hush, Lupin! Do not pray add insult to injury."Lupin said: "What do you mean by injury? I repeat, I have done noinjury. Crowbillon is simply tired of a stagnant stick-in-the-mud firm,and made the change on his own account. I simply recommended thenew firm as a matter of biz - good old biz!"I said quietly: "I don't understand your slang, and at my time of lifehave no desire to learn it; so, Lupin, my boy, let us change the subject. Iwill, if it please you, TRY and be interested in your new hat adventure."Lupin said: "Oh! there's nothing much about it, except I have notonce seen him since his marriage, and he said he was very pleased to seeme, and hoped we should be friends. I stood a drink to cement thefriendship, and he stood me a new hat - one of his own."I said rather wearily: "But you have not told me your old friend'sname?"Lupin said, with affected carelessness: "Oh didn't I? Well, I will.</p> 
<p>　　It was MURRAY POSH." May 14. - Lupin came down late, and seeing me at home all themorning, asked the reason of it. Carrie and I both agreed it was better tosay nothing to him about the letter I was writing, so I evaded the question.</p> 
<p>　　Lupin went out, saying he was going to lunch with Murray Posh in theCity. I said I hoped Mr. Posh would provide him with a berth. Lupinwent out laughing, saying: "I don't mind WEARING Posh's one- pricedhats, but I am not going to SELL them." Poor boy, I fear he is perfectlyhopeless.</p> 
<p>　　It took me nearly the whole day to write to Mr. Crowbillon. Once ortwice I asked Carrie for suggestions; and although it seems ungrateful, hersuggestions were none of them to the point, while one or two wereabsolutely idiotic. Of course I did not tell her so. I got the letter off,and took it down to the office for Mr. Perkupp to see, but he againrepeated that he could trust me.</p> 
<p>　　Gowing called in the evening, and I was obliged to tell him aboutLupin and Mr. Perkupp; and, to my surprise, he was quite inclined to sidewith Lupin. Carrie joined in, and said she thought I was taking much toomelancholy a view of it. Gowing produced a pint sample-bottle ofMadeira, which had been given him, which he said would get rid of theblues. I dare say it would have done so if there had been more of it; butas Gowing helped himself to three glasses, it did not leave much for Carrieand me to get rid of the blues with.</p> 
<p>　　May 15. - A day of great anxiety, for I expected every moment a letterfrom Mr. Crowbillon. Two letters came in the evening - one for me, with"Crowbillon Hall" printed in large gold-and-red letters on the back of theenvelope; the other for Lupin, which I felt inclined to open and read, as ithad "Gylterson, Sons, and Co. Limited," which was the recommendedfirm. I trembled as I opened Mr. Crowbillon's letter. I wrote himsixteen pages, closely written; he wrote me less than sixteen lines.</p> 
<p>　　His letter was: "Sir, - I totally disagree with you. Your son, in thecourse of five minutes' conversation, displayed more intelligence thanyour firm has done during the last five years. - Yours faithfully, Gilbert E.</p> 
<p>　　Gillam O. Crowbillon."What am I to do? Here is a letter that I dare not show to Mr. Perkupp, and would not show to Lupin for anything. The crisis had yet to come;for Lupin arrived, and, opening his letter, showed a cheque for 25 poundsas a commission for the recommendation of Mr. Crowbillon, whosecustom to Mr. Perkupp is evidently lost for ever. Cummings and Gowingboth called, and both took Lupin's part. Cummings went so far as to saythat Lupin would make a name yet. I suppose I was melancholy, for Icould only ask: "Yes, but what sort of a name?"May 16. - I told Mr. Perkupp the contents of the letter in a modifiedform, but Mr. Perkupp said: "Pray don't discuss the matter; it is at an end.</p> 
<p>　　Your son will bring his punishment upon himself." I went home in theevening, thinking of the hopeless future of Lupin. I found him in mostextravagant spirits and in evening dress. He threw a letter on the tablefor me to read.</p> 
<p>　　To my amazement, I read that Gylterson and Sons had absolutelyengaged Lupin at a salary of 200 pounds a year, with other advantages. Iread the letter through three times and thought it must have been for me.</p> 
<p>　　But there it was - Lupin Pooter - plain enough. I was silent. Lupin said:</p> 
<p>　　"What price Perkupp now? You take my tip, Guv. - 'off' with Perkuppand freeze on to Gylterson, the firm of the future! Perkupp's firm? Thestagnant dummies have been standing still for years, and now are movingback. I want to go on. In fact I must go OFF, as I am dining with theMurray Poshs to-night."In the exuberance of his spirits he hit his hat with his stick, gave a loudwar "Whoo-oop," jumped over a chair, and took the liberty of rumplingmy hair all over my forehead, and bounced out of the room, giving me nochance of reminding him of his age and the respect which was due to hisparent. Gowing and Cummings came in the evening, and positivelycheered me up with congratulations respecting Lupin.</p> 
<p>　　Gowing said: "I always said he would get on, and, take my word, hehas more in his head than we three put together."Carrie said: "He is a second Hardfur Huttle."</p>
