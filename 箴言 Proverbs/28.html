<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The evil man goes running away when no man is after him, but the upright are without fear, like the lion. 
<br>28:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 邦 国 因 有 罪 过 ， 君 王 就 多 更 换 。 因 有 聪 明 知 识 的 人 ， 国 必 长 存 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Because of the sin of the land, its troubles are increased; but by a man of wisdom and knowledge they will be put out like a fire. 
<br>28:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 穷 人 欺 压 贫 民 ， 好 像 暴 雨 冲 没 粮 食 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; A man of wealth who is cruel to the poor is like a violent rain causing destruction of food. 
<br>28:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 违 弃 律 法 的 ， 夸 奖 恶 人 。 遵 守 律 法 的 ， 却 与 恶 人 相 争 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Those who have no respect for the law give praise to the evil-doer; but such as keep the law are against him. 
<br>28:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 坏 人 不 明 白 公 义 。 惟 有 寻 求 耶 和 华 的 ， 无 不 明 白 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all things. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Evil men have no knowledge of what is right; but those who go after the Lord have knowledge of all things. 
<br>28:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 行 为 纯 正 的 穷 乏 人 ， 胜 过 行 事 乖 僻 的 富 足 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Better is the poor man whose ways are upright, than the man of wealth whose ways are not straight. 
<br>28:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 谨 守 律 法 的 是 智 慧 之 子 。 与 贪 食 人 作 伴 的 ， 却 羞 辱 其 父 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; He who keeps the law is a wise son, but he who keeps company with feasters puts shame on his father. 
<br>28:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 人 以 厚 利 加 增 财 物 ， 是 给 那 怜 悯 穷 人 者 积 蓄 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; He who makes his wealth greater by taking interest, only gets it together for him who has pity on the poor. 
<br>28:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 转 耳 不 听 律 法 的 ， 他 的 祈 祷 也 为 可 憎 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; As for the man whose ear is turned away from hearing the law, even his prayer is disgusting. 
<br>28:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 诱 惑 正 直 人 行 恶 道 的 ， 必 掉 在 自 己 的 坑 里 。 惟 有 完 全 人 ， 必 承 受 福 分 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good things in possession. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Anyone causing the upright to go wandering in an evil way, will himself go down into the hole he has made; but the upright will have good things for their heritage. 
<br>28:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 富 足 人 自 以 为 有 智 慧 。 但 聪 明 的 贫 穷 人 ， 能 将 他 查 透 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The man of wealth seems to himself to be wise, but the poor man who has sense has a low opinion of him. 
<br>28:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 义 人 得 志 有 大 荣 耀 。 恶 人 兴 起 人 就 躲 藏 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; When the upright do well, there is great glory; but when evil-doers are lifted up, men do not let themselves be seen. 
<br>28:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 遮 掩 自 己 罪 过 的 ， 必 不 亨 通 。 承 认 离 弃 罪 过 的 ， 必 蒙 怜 恤 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; He who keeps his sins secret will not do well; but one who is open about them, and gives them up, will get mercy. 
<br>28:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 常 存 敬 畏 的 ， 便 为 有 福 。 心 存 刚 硬 的 ， 必 陷 在 祸 患 里 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Happy is the man in whom is the fear of the Lord at all times; but he whose heart is hard will come into trouble. 
<br>28:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 暴 虐 的 君 王 辖 制 贫 民 。 好 像 吼 叫 的 狮 子 ， 觅 食 的 熊 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the poor people. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Like a loud-voiced lion and a wandering bear, is an evil ruler over a poor people. 
<br>28:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 无 知 的 君 多 行 暴 虐 。 以 贪 财 为 可 恨 的 ， 必 年 长 日 久 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The prince who has no sense is a cruel ruler; but he who has no desire to get profit for himself will have long life. 
<br>28:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 背 负 流 人 血 之 罪 的 ， 必 往 坑 里 奔 跑 ， 谁 也 不 可 拦 阻 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; One who has been the cause of a man's death will go in flight to the underworld: let no man give him help. 
<br>28:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 行 动 正 直 的 ， 必 蒙 拯 救 。 行 事 弯 曲 的 ， 立 时 跌 倒 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; He whose ways are upright will be safe, but sudden will be the fall of him whose ways are twisted. 
<br>28:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 耕 种 自 己 田 地 的 ， 必 得 饱 食 。 追 随 虚 浮 的 ， 足 受 穷 乏 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; By ploughing his land a man will have bread in full measure; but he who goes after good-for-nothing persons will be poor enough. 
<br>28:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 诚 实 人 必 多 得 福 ， 想 要 急 速 发 财 的 ， 不 免 受 罚 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; A man of good faith will have great blessing, but one attempting to get wealth quickly will not go free from punishment. 
<br>28:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 看 人 的 情 面 ， 乃 为 不 好 。 人 因 一 块 饼 枉 法 ， 也 为 不 好 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of bread that man will transgress. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; It is not good to have respect for a man's position: for a man will do wrong for a bit of bread. 
<br>28:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 人 有 恶 眼 想 要 急 速 发 财 ， 却 不 知 穷 乏 必 临 到 他 身 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; He who is ever desiring wealth goes running after money, and does not see that need will come on him. 
<br>28:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 责 备 人 的 ， 后 来 蒙 人 喜 悦 ， 多 于 那 用 舌 头 谄 媚 人 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; He who says words of protest to a man will later have more approval than one who says smooth words with his tongue. 
<br>28:24 [hgb]&nbsp; 偷 窃 父 母 的 ， 说 ， 这 不 是 罪 。 此 人 就 是 与 强 盗 同 类 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; He who takes from his father or his mother what is theirs by right, and says, It is no sin; is the same as a taker of life. 
<br>28:25 [hgb]&nbsp; 心 中 贪 婪 的 ， 挑 起 争 端 。 倚 靠 耶 和 华 的 ， 必 得 丰 裕 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; He who is ever desiring profit is a cause of fighting; but he who puts his faith in the Lord will be made fat. 
<br>28:26 [hgb]&nbsp; 心 中 自 是 的 ， 便 是 愚 昧 人 。 凭 智 慧 行 事 的 ， 必 蒙 拯 救 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; He whose faith is in himself is foolish; but everyone walking wisely will be kept safe. 
<br>28:27 [hgb]&nbsp; 周 济 贫 穷 的 ， 不 致 缺 乏 。 佯 为 不 见 的 ， 必 多 受 咒 诅 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; He who gives to the poor will never be in need, but great curses will be on him who gives no attention to them. 
<br>28:28 [hgb]&nbsp; 恶 人 兴 起 ， 人 就 躲 藏 。 恶 人 败 亡 ， 义 人 增 多 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; When evil-doers are lifted up, men take cover; but when destruction overtakes them, the upright are increased.
