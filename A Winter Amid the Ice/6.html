The crew were almost all the time at work with the saws, and often powder had to be used to blow up the enormous blocks of ice which closed the way.
<br> 
<br> On the 12th of September the sea consisted of one solid plain, without outlet or passage, surrounding the vessel on all sides, so that she could neither advance nor retreat. The temperature remained at an average of sixteen degrees below zero. The winter season had come on, with its sufferings and dangers.
<br> 
<br> The “Jeune–Hardie” was then near the 21st degree of longitude west and the 76th degree of latitude north, at the entrance of Ga?l-Hamkes Bay.
<br> 
<br> Jean Cornbutte made his preliminary preparations for wintering. He first searched for a creek whose position would shelter the ship from the wind and breaking up of the ice. Land, which was probably thirty miles west, could alone offer him secure shelter, and he resolved to attempt to reach it.
<br> 
<br> He set out on the 12th of September, accompanied by André Vasling, Penellan, and the two sailors Gradlin and Turquiette. Each man carried provisions for two days, for it was not likely that their expedition would occupy a longer time, and they were supplied with skins on which to sleep.
<br> 
<br> Snow had fallen in great abundance and was not yet frozen over; and this delayed them seriously. They often sank to their waists, and could only advance very cautiously, for fear of falling into crevices. Penellan, who walked in front, carefully sounded each depression with his iron-pointed staff.
<br> 
<br> About five in the evening the fog began to thicken, and the little band were forced to stop. Penellan looked about for an iceberg which might shelter them from the wind, and after refreshing themselves, with regrets that they had no warm drink, they spread their skins on the snow, wrapped themselves up, lay close to each other, and soon dropped asleep from sheer fatigue.
<br> 
<br> The next morning Jean Cornbutte and his companions were buried beneath a bed of snow more than a foot deep. Happily their skins, perfectly impermeable, had preserved them, and the snow itself had aided in retaining their heat, which it prevented from escaping.
<br> 
<br> The captain gave the signal of departure, and about noon they at last descried the coast, which at first they could scarcely distinguish. High ledges of ice, cut perpendicularly, rose on the shore; their variegated summits, of all forms and shapes, reproduced on a large scale the phenomena of crystallization. Myriads of aquatic fowl flew about at the approach of the party, and the seals, lazily lying on the ice, plunged hurriedly into the depths.
<br> 
<br> “I’ faith!” said Penellan, “we shall not want for either furs or game!”
<br> 
<br> “Those animals,” returned Cornbutte, “give every evidence of having been already visited by men; for in places totally uninhabited they would not be so wild.”
<br> 
<br> “None but Greenlanders frequent these parts,” said André Vasling.
<br> 
<br> “I see no trace of their passage, however; neither any encampment nor the smallest hut,” said Penellan, who had climbed up a high peak. “O captain!” he continued, “come here! I see a point of land which will shelter us splendidly from the north-east wind.”
<br> 
<br> “Come along, boys!” said Jean Cornbutte.
<br> 
<br> His companions followed him, and they soon rejoined Penellan. The sailor had said what was true. An elevated point of land jutted out like a promontory, and curving towards the coast, formed a little inlet of a mile in width at most. Some moving ice-blocks, broken by this point, floated in the midst, and the sea, sheltered from the colder winds, was not yet entirely frozen over.
<br> 
<br> This was an excellent spot for wintering, and it only remained to get the ship thither. Jean Cornbutte remarked that the neighbouring ice-field was very thick, and it seemed very difficult to cut a canal to bring the brig to its destination. Some other creek, then, must be found; it was in vain that he explored northward. The coast remained steep and abrupt for a long distance, and beyond the point it was directly exposed to the attacks of the east-wind. The circumstance disconcerted the captain all the more because André Vasling used strong arguments to show how bad the situation was. Penellan, in this dilemma, found it difficult to convince himself that all was for the best.
<br> 
<br> But one chance remained — to seek a shelter on the southern side of the coast. This was to return on their path, but hesitation was useless. The little band returned rapidly in the direction of the ship, as their provisions had begun to run short. Jean Cornbutte searched for some practicable passage, or at least some fissure by which a canal might be cut across the ice-fields, all along the route, but in vain.
<br> 
<br> Towards evening the sailors came to the same place where they had encamped over night. There had been no snow during the day, and they could recognize the imprint of their bodies on the ice. They again disposed themselves to sleep with their furs.
<br> 
<br> Penellan, much disturbed by the bad success of the expedition, was sleeping restlessly, when, at a waking moment, his attention was attracted by a dull rumbling. He listened attentively, and the rumbling seemed so strange that he nudged Jean Cornbutte with his elbow.
<br> 
<br> “What is that?” said the latter, whose mind, according to a sailor’s habit, was awake as soon as his body.
<br> 
<br> “Listen, captain.”
<br> 
<br> The noise increased, with perceptible violence.
<br> 
<br> “It cannot be thunder, in so high a latitude,” said Cornbutte, rising.
<br> 
<br> “I think we have come across some white bears,” replied Penellan.
<br> 
<br> “The devil! We have not seen any yet.”
<br> 
<br> “Sooner or later, we must have expected a visit from them. Let us give them a good reception.”
<br> 
<br> Penellan, armed with a gun, lightly crossed the ledge which sheltered them. The darkness was very dense; he could discover nothing; but a new incident soon showed him that the cause of the noise did not proceed from around them.
<br> 
<br> Jean Cornbutte rejoined him, and they observed with terror that this rumbling, which awakened their companions, came from beneath them.
<br> 
<br> A new kind of peril menaced them. To the noise, which resembled peals of thunder, was added a distinct undulating motion of the ice-field. Several of the party lost their balance and fell.
<br> 
<br> “Attention!” cried Penellan.
<br> 
<br> “Yes!” some one responded.
<br> 
<br> “Turquiette! Gradlin! where are you?”
<br> 
<br> “Here I am!” responded Turquiette, shaking off the snow with which he was covered.
<br> 
<br> “This way, Vasling,” cried Cornbutte to the mate. “And Gradlin?”
<br> 
<br> “Present, captain. But we are lost!” shouted Gradlin, in fright.
<br> 
<br> “No!” said Penellan. “Perhaps we are saved!”
<br> 
<br> Hardly had he uttered these words when a frightful cracking noise was heard. The ice-field broke clear through, and the sailors were forced to cling to the block which was quivering just by them. Despite the helmsman’s words, they found themselves in a most perilous position, for an ice-quake had occurred. The ice masses had just “weighed anchor,” as the sailors say. The movement lasted nearly two minutes, and it was to be feared that the crevice would yawn at the very feet of the unhappy sailors. They anxiously awaited daylight in the midst of continuous shocks, for they could not, without risk of death, move a step, and had to remain stretched out at full length to avoid being engulfed.
<br> 
<br> As soon as it was daylight a very different aspect presented itself to their eyes. The vast plain, a compact mass the evening before, was now separated in a thousand places, and the waves, raised by some submarine commotion, had broken the thick layer which sheltered them.
<br> 
<br> The thought of his ship occurred to Jean Cornbutte’s mind.
<br> 
<br> “My poor brig!” he cried. “It must have perished!”
<br> 
<br> The deepest despair began to overcast the faces of his companions. The loss of the ship inevitably preceded their own deaths.
<br> 
<br> “Courage, friends,” said Penellan. “Reflect that this night’s disaster has opened us a path across the ice, which will enable us to bring our ship to the bay for wintering! And, stop! I am not mistaken. There is the ‘Jeune–Hardie,’ a mile nearer to us!”
<br> 
<br> All hurried forward, and so imprudently, that Turquiette slipped into a fissure, and would have certainly perished, had not Jean Cornbutte seized him by his hood. He got off with a rather cold bath.
<br> 
<br> The brig was indeed floating two miles away. After infinite trouble, the little band reached her. She was in good condition; but her rudder, which they had neglected to lift, had been broken by the ice.
