<p>KING JOHN</p> 
<p>Had sloth been a temptation by which Durward was easily beset, the noise with which the caserne of the guards resounded after the first toll of primes, had certainly banished the siren from his couch; but the discipline of his father's tower, and of the convent of Aberbrothick, had taught him to start with the dawn; and he did on his clothes gaily, amid the sounding of bugles and the clash of armour, which announced the change of the vigilant guards -- some of whom were returning to barracks after their nightly duty, whilst some were marching out to that of the morning -- and others, again, amongst whom was his uncle, were arming for immediate attendance upon the person of Louis. Quentin Durward soon put on, with the feelings of so young a man on such an occasion, the splendid dress and arms appertaining to his new situation; and his uncle, who looked with great accuracy and interest to see that he was completely fitted out in every respect, did not conceal his satisfaction at the improvement which had been thus made in his nephew's appearance.</p> 
<p>"If thou dost prove as faithful and bold as thou art well favoured, I shall have in thee one of the handsomest and best esquires in the Guard, which cannot but be an honour to thy mother's family. Follow me to the presence chamber; and see thou keep close at my shoulder."</p> 
<p>So saying, he took up a partisan, large, weighty, and beautifully inlaid and ornamented, and directing his nephew to assume a lighter weapon of a similar description, they proceeded to the inner court of the palace, where their comrades, who were to form the guard of the interior apartments, were already drawn up and under arms -- the squires each standing behind their masters, to whom they thus formed a second rank. Here were also in attendance many yeomen prickers, with gallant horses and noble dogs, on which Quentin looked with such inquisitive delight that his uncle was obliged more than once to remind him that the animals were not there for his private amusement, but for the King's, who had a strong passion for the chase, one of the few inclinations which he indulged even when coming in competition with his course of policy; being so strict a protector of the game in the royal forests that it was currently said you might kill a man with greater impunity than a stag.</p> 
<p>On a signal given, the Guards were put into motion by the command of Le Balafre, who acted as officer upon the occasion; and, after some minutiae of word and signal, which all served to show the extreme and punctilious jealousy with which their duty was performed, they marched into the hall of audience where the King was immediately expected.</p> 
<p>New as Quentin was to scenes of splendour, the effect of that which was now before him rather disappointed the expectations which he had formed of the brilliancy of a court. There were household officers, indeed, richly attired; there were guards gallantly armed, and there were domestics of various degrees. But he saw none of the ancient counsellors of the kingdom, none of the high officers of the crown, heard none of the names which in those days sounded an alarum to chivalry; saw none either of those generals or leaders, who, possessed of the full prime of manhood, were the strength of France, or of the more youthful and fiery nobles, those early aspirants after honour, who were her pride. The jealous habits, the reserved manners, the deep and artful policy of the King, had estranged this splendid circle from the throne, and they were only called around it upon certain stated and formal occasions, when they went reluctantly, and returned joyfully, as the animals in the fable are supposed to have approached and left the den of the lion.</p> 
<p>The very few persons who seemed to be there in the character of counsellors were mean looking men, whose countenances sometimes expressed sagacity, but whose manners showed they were called into a sphere for which their previous education and habits had qualified them but indifferently. One or two persons, however, did appear to Durward to possess a more noble mien, and the strictness of the present duty was not such as to prevent his uncle's communicating the names of those whom he thus distinguished.</p> 
<p>With the Lord Crawford, who was in attendance, dressed in the rich habit of his office, and holding a leading staff of silver in his hand, Quentin, as well as the reader, was already acquainted. Among others, who seemed of quality, the most remarkable was the Count de Dunois, the son of that celebrated Dunois, known by the name of the Bastard of Orleans, who, fighting under the banner of Jeanne d'Arc, acted such a distinguished part in liberating France from the English yoke. His son well supported the high renown which had descended to him from such an honoured source; and, notwithstanding his connexion with the royal family, and his hereditary popularity both with the nobles and the people, Dunois had, upon all occasions, manifested such an open, frank loyalty of character that he seemed to have escaped all suspicion, even on the part of the jealous Louis, who loved to see him near his person, and sometimes even called him to his councils. Although accounted complete in all the exercises of chivalry, and possessed of much of the character of what was then termed a perfect knight, the person of the Count was far from being a model of romantic beauty. He was under the common size, though very strongly built, and his legs rather curved outwards, into that make which is more convenient for horseback, than elegant in a pedestrian. His shoulders were broad, his hair black, his complexion swarthy, his arms remarkably long and nervous. The features of his countenance were irregular, even to ugliness; yet, after all, there was an air of conscious worth and nobility about the Count de Dunois, which stamped, at the first glance, the character of the high born nobleman and the undaunted soldier. His mien was bold and upright, his step free and manly, and the harshness of his countenance was dignified by a glance like an eagle, and a frown like a lion. His dress was a hunting suit, rather sumptuous than gay, and he acted on most occasions as Grand Huntsman, though we are not inclined to believe that he actually held the office.</p> 
<p>Upon the arm of his relation Dunois, walking with a step so slow and melancholy that he seemed to rest on his kinsman and supporter, came Louis Duke of Orleans, the first prince of the Blood Royal (afterwards King, by the name of Louis XII), and to whom the guards and attendants rendered their homage as such. The jealously watched object of Louis's suspicions, this Prince, who, failing the King's offspring, was heir to the kingdom, was not suffered to absent himself from Court, and, while residing there, was alike denied employment and countenance. The dejection which his degraded and almost captive state naturally impressed on the deportment of this unfortunate Prince, was at this moment greatly increased by his consciousness that the King meditated, with respect to him, one of the most cruel and unjust actions which a tyrant could commit, by compelling him to give his hand to the Princess Joan of France, the younger daughter of Louis, to whom he had been contracted in infancy, but whose deformed person rendered the insisting upon such an agreement an act of abominable rigour.</p> 
<p>The exterior of this unhappy Prince was in no respect distinguished by personal advantages; and in mind, he was of a gentle, mild and beneficent disposition, qualities which were visible even through the veil of extreme dejection with which his natural character was at present obscured. Quentin observed that the Duke studiously avoided even looking at the Royal Guards, and when he returned their salute, that he kept his eyes bent on the ground, as if he feared the King's jealousy might have construed the gesture of ordinary courtesy as arising from the purpose of establishing a separate and personal interest among them.</p> 
<p>Very different was the conduct of the proud Cardinal and Prelate, John of Balue, the favourite minister of Louis for the time, whose rise and character bore as close a resemblance to that of Wolsey, as the difference betwixt the crafty and politic Louis and the headlong and rash Henry VIII of England would permit. The former had raised his minister from the lowest rank, to the dignity, or at least to the emoluments, of Grand Almoner of France, loaded him with benefices, and obtained for him the hat of a cardinal; and although he was too cautious to repose in the ambitious Balue the unbounded power and trust which Henry placed in Wolsey, yet he was more influenced by him than by any other of his avowed counsellors. The Cardinal, accordingly, had not escaped the error incidental to those who are suddenly raised to power from an obscure situation, for he entertained a strong persuasion, dazzled doubtlessly by the suddenness of his elevation, that his capacity was equal to intermeddling with affairs of every kind, even those most foreign to his profession and studies. Tall and ungainly in his person, he affected gallantry and admiration of the fair sex, although his manners rendered his pretensions absurd, and his profession marked them as indecorous. Some male or female flatterer had, in evil hour, possessed him with the idea that there was much beauty of contour in a pair of huge, substantial legs, which he had derived from his father, a car man of Limoges -- or, according to other authorities, a miller of Verdun, and with this idea he had become so infatuated that he always had his cardinal's robes a little looped up on one side, that the sturdy proportion of his limbs might not escape observation. As he swept through the stately apartment in his crimson dress and rich cope, he stopped repeatedly to look at the arms and appointments of the cavaliers on guard, asked them several questions in an authoritative tone, and took upon him to censure some of them for what he termed irregularities of discipline, in language to which these experienced soldiers dared no reply, although it was plain they listened to it with impatience and with contempt.</p> 
<p>(Wolsey (1471-1530): at one time the chief favourite of Henry VIII. He was raised from obscurity by that sovereign to be Archbishop of York, Lord Chancellor of England, and Cardinal. As legate of the Pope, he gained the ill will of Henry by his failure to secure that king's divorce. He was deprived of his offices, his property was confiscated to the crown, and in 1530 he was arrested for high treason, but died on his way to trial.)</p> 
<p>"Is the King aware," said Dunois to the Cardinal, "that the Burgundian Envoy is peremptory in demanding an audience?"</p> 
<p>"He is," answered the Cardinal; "and here, as I think, comes the all sufficient Oliver Dain, to let us know the royal pleasure."</p> 
<p>As he spoke, a remarkable person, who then divided the favour of Louis with the proud Cardinal himself, entered from the inner apartment, but without any of that important and consequential demeanour which marked the full blown dignity of the churchman. On the contrary, this was a little, pale, meagre man, whose black silk jerkin and hose, without either coat, cloak, or cassock, formed a dress ill qualified to set off to advantage a very ordinary person. He carried a silver basin in his hand, and a napkin flung over his arm indicated his menial capacity. His visage was penetrating and quick, although he endeavoured to banish such expression from his features by keeping his eyes fixed on the ground, while, with the stealthy and quiet pace of a cat, he seemed modestly rather to glide than to walk through the apartment. But though modesty may easily obscure worth, it cannot hide court favour; and all attempts to steal unperceived through the presence chamber were vain, on the part of one known to have such possession of the King's ear as had been attained by his celebrated barber and groom of the chamber, Oliver le Dain, called sometimes Oliver le Mauvais, and sometimes Oliver le Diable, epithets derived from the unscrupulous cunning with which he assisted in the execution of the schemes of his master's tortuous policy. At present he spoke earnestly for a few moments with the Count de Dunois, who instantly left the chamber, while the tonsor glided quietly back towards the royal apartment whence he had issued, every one giving place to him; which civility he only acknowledged by the most humble inclination of the body, excepting in a very few instances, where he made one or two persons the subject of envy to all the other courtiers, by whispering a single word in their ear; and at the same time muttering something of the duties of his place, he escaped from their replies as well as from the eager solicitations of those who wished to attract his notice. Ludovic Lesly had the good fortune to be one of the individuals who, on the present occasion, was favoured by Oliver with a single word, to assure him that his matter was fortunately terminated.</p> 
<p>Presently afterwards he had another proof of the same agreeable tidings; for Quentin's old acquaintance, Tristan l'Hermite, the Provost Marshal of the royal household, entered the apartment, and came straight to the place where Balafre was posted. This formidable officer's uniform, which was very rich, had only the effect of making his sinister countenance and bad mien more strikingly remarkable, and the tone, which he meant for conciliatory, was like nothing so much as the growling of a bear. The import of his words, however, was more amicable than the voice in which they were pronounced. He regretted the mistake which had fallen between them on the preceding day, and observed it was owing to the Sieur Le Balafre's nephew's not wearing the uniform of his corps, or announcing himself as belonging to it, which had led him into the error for which he now asked forgiveness.</p> 
<p>Ludovic Lesly made the necessary reply, and as soon as Tristan had turned away, observed to his nephew that they had now the distinction of having a mortal enemy from henceforward in the person of this dreaded officer.</p> 
<p>"But we are above his volee (brood, rank, class) -- a soldier," said he, "who does his duty, may laugh at the Provost Marshal."</p> 
<p>Quentin could not help being of his uncle's opinion, for, as Tristan parted from them, it was with the look of angry defiance which the bear casts upon the hunter whose spear has wounded him. Indeed, even when less strongly moved, the sullen eye of this official expressed a malevolence of purpose which made men shudder to meet his glance; and the thrill of the young Scot was the deeper and more abhorrent, that he seemed to himself still to feel on his shoulders the grasp of the two death doing functionaries of this fatal officer.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Oliver, after he had prowled around the room in the stealthy manner which we have endeavoured to describe -- all, even the highest officers making way for him, and loading him with their ceremonious attentions, which his modesty seemed desirous to avoid -- again entered the inner apartment, the doors of which were presently thrown open, and King Louis entered the presence chamber.</p> 
<p>Quentin, like all others, turned his eyes upon him; and started so suddenly that he almost dropped his weapon, when he recognised in the King of France that silk merchant, Maitre Pierre, who had been the companion of his morning walk. Singular suspicions respecting the real rank of this person had at different times crossed his thoughts; but this, the proved reality, was wilder than his wildest conjecture.</p> 
<p>The stern look of his uncle, offended at this breach of the decorum of his office, recalled him to himself; but not a little was he astonished when the King, whose quick eye had at once discovered him, walked straight to the place where he was posted, without taking notice of any one else.</p> 
<p>"So;" he said, "young man, I am told you have been brawling on your first arrival in Touraine; but I pardon you, as it was chiefly the fault of a foolish old merchant, who thought your Caledonian blood required to be heated in the morning with Vin de Beaulne. If I can find him, I will make him an example to those who debauch my Guards. -- Balafre," he added, speaking to Lesly, "your kinsman is a fair youth, though a fiery. We love to cherish such spirits, and mean to make more than ever we did of the brave men who are around us. Let the year, day, hour, and minute of your nephew's birth be written down and given to Oliver Dain."</p> 
<p>Le Balafre bowed to the ground, and re-assumed his erect military position, as one who would show by his demeanour his promptitude to act in the King's quarrel or defence. Quentin, in the meantime, recovered from his first surprise, studied the King's appearance more attentively, and was surprised to find how differently he now construed his deportment and features than he had done at their first interview.</p> 
<p>These were not much changed in exterior, for Louis, always a scorner of outward show, wore, on the present occasion, an old dark blue hunting dress, not much better than the plain burgher suit of the preceding day, and garnished with a huge rosary of ebony which had been sent to him by no less a personage than the Grand Seignior, with an attestation that it had been used by a Coptic hermit on Mount Lebanon, a personage of profound sanctity. And instead of his cap with a single image, he now wore a hat, the band of which was garnished with at least a dozen of little paltry figures of saints stamped in lead. But those eyes, which, according to Quentin's former impression, only twinkled with the love of gain, had, now that they were known to be the property of an able and powerful monarch, a piercing and majestic glance; and those wrinkles on the brow, which he had supposed were formed during a long series of petty schemes of commerce, seemed now the furrows which sagacity had worn while toiling in meditation upon the fate of nations.</p> 
<p>Presently after the King's appearance, the Princesses of France, with the ladies of their suite, entered the apartment. With the eldest, afterwards married to Peter of Bourbon, and known in French history by the name of the Lady of Beaujeu, our story has but little to do. She was tall, and rather handsome, possessed eloquence, talent, and much of her father's sagacity, who reposed great confidence in her, and loved her as well perhaps as he loved any one.</p> 
<p>The younger sister, the unfortunate Joan, the destined bride of the Duke of Orleans, advanced timidly by the side of her sister, conscious of a total want of those external qualities which women are most desirous of possessing, or being thought to possess. She was pale, thin, and sickly in her complexion; her shape visibly bent to one side, and her gait was so unequal that she might be called lame. A fine set of teeth, and eyes which were expressive of melancholy, softness, and resignation, with a quantity of light brown locks, were the only redeeming points which flattery itself could have dared to number, to counteract the general homeliness of her face and figure. To complete the picture, it was easy to remark, from the Princess's negligence in dress and the timidity of her manner, that she had an unusual and distressing consciousness of her own plainness of appearance, and did not dare to make any of those attempts to mend by manners or by art what nature had left amiss, or in any other way to exert a power of pleasing. The King (who loved her not) stepped hastily to her as she entered.</p> 
<p>"How now," he said, "our world contemning daughter -- Are you robed for a hunting party, or for the convent, this morning? Speak -- answer."</p> 
<p>"For which your highness pleases, sire," said the Princess, scarce raising her voice above her breath.</p> 
<p>"Ay, doubtless, you would persuade me it is your desire to quit the Court, Joan, and renounce the world and its vanities. -- Ha! maiden, wouldst thou have it thought that we, the first born of Holy Church, would refuse our daughter to Heaven? -- Our Lady and Saint Martin forbid we should refuse the offering, were it worthy of the altar, or were thy vocation in truth thitherward!"</p> 
<p>So saying, the King crossed himself devoutly, looking in the meantime, as appeared to Quentin, very like a cunning vassal, who was depreciating the merit of something which he was desirous to keep to himself, in order that he might stand excused for not offering it to his chief or superior.</p> 
<p>"Dares he thus play the hypocrite with Heaven," thought Durward, "and sport with God and the Saints, as he may safely do with men, who dare not search his nature too closely?"</p> 
<p>Louis meantime resumed, after a moment's mental devotion, "No, fair daughter, I and another know your real mind better. Ha! fair cousin of Orleans, do we not? Approach, fair sir, and lead this devoted vestal of ours to her horse."</p> 
<p>Orleans started when the King spoke and hastened to obey him; but with such precipitation of step, and confusion, that Louis called out, "Nay, cousin, rein your gallantry, and look before you. Why, what a headlong matter a gallant's haste is on some occasions! You had well nigh taken Anne's hand instead of her sister's. -- Sir, must I give Joan's to you myself?"</p> 
<p>The unhappy Prince looked up, and shuddered like a child, when forced to touch something at which it has instinctive horror -- then making an effort, took the hand which the Princess neither gave nor yet withheld. As they stood, her cold, damp fingers enclosed in his trembling hand, with their eyes looking on the ground, it would have been difficult to say which of these two youthful beings was rendered more utterly miserable -- the Duke, who felt himself fettered to the object of his aversion by bonds which he durst not tear asunder, or the unfortunate young woman, who too plainly saw that she was an object of abhorrence to him, to gain whose kindness she would willingly have died.</p> 
<p>"And now to horse, gentlemen and ladies -- we will ourselves lead forth our daughter of Beaujeu," said the King; "and God's blessing and Saint Hubert's be on our morning's sport!"</p> 
<p>"I am, I fear, doomed to interrupt it, Sire," said the Comte de Dunois; "the Burgundian Envoy is before the gates of the Castle and demands an audience."</p> 
<p>"Demands an audience, Dunois?" replied the King. "Did you not answer him, as we sent you word by Oliver, that we were not at leisure to see him today, -- and that tomorrow was the festival of Saint Martin, which, please Heaven, we would disturb by no earthly thoughts -- and that on the succeeding day we were designed for Amboise -- but that we would not fail to appoint him as early an audience, when we returned, as our pressing affairs would permit."</p> 
<p>"All this I said," answered Dunois, "but yet, Sire --"</p> 
<p>"Pasques dieu! man, what is it that thus sticks in thy throat?" said the King. "This Burgundian's terms must have been hard of digestion."</p> 
<p>"Had not my duty, your Grace's commands, and his character as an envoy, restrained me," said Dunois, "he should have tried to digest them himself; for, by our Lady of Orleans, I had more mind to have made him eat his own words, than to have brought them to your Majesty."</p> 
<p>"Body of me," said the King, "it is strange that thou, one of the most impatient fellows alive, should have so little sympathy with the like infirmity in our blunt and fiery cousin, Charles of Burgundy. Why, man, I mind his blustering messages no more than the towers of this Castle regard the whistling of the northeast wind, which comes from Flanders, as well as this brawling Envoy."</p> 
<p>"Know then, Sire," replied Dunois, "that the Count of Crevecoeur tarries below, with his retinue of pursuivants and trumpets, and says, that since your Majesty refuses him the audience which his master has instructed him to demand, upon matters of most pressing concern, he will remain there till midnight, and accost your Majesty at whatever hour you are pleased to issue from your Castle, whether for business, exercise, or devotion; and that no consideration, except the use of absolute force, shall compel him to desist from this."</p> 
<p>"He is a fool," said the King, with much composure. "Does the hot headed Hainaulter think it any penance for a man of sense to remain for twenty-four hours quiet within the walls of his Castle, when he hath the affairs of a kingdom to occupy him? These impatient coxcombs think that all men, like themselves, are miserable, save when in saddle and stirrup. Let the dogs be put up, and well looked to, gentle Dunois. -- We will hold council today, instead of hunting."</p> 
<p>"My Liege," answered Dunois, "you will not thus rid yourself of Crevecoeur; for his master's instructions are, that if he hath not this audience which he demands, he shall nail his gauntlet to the palisade before the Castle in token of mortal defiance on the part of his master, shall renounce the Duke's fealty to France, and declare instant war."</p> 
<p>"Ay," said Louis without any perceptible alteration of voice, but frowning until his piercing dark eyes became almost invisible under his shaggy eyebrows, "is it even so? will our ancient vassal prove so masterful -- our dear cousin treat us thus unkindly? -- Nay, then, Dunois, we must unfold the Oriflamme, and cry Dennis Montjoye!"</p> 
<p>(Montjoie St. Denis, a former war cry of the French soldiers. Saint Denis was a patron saint of France who suffered martyrdom in the third century. Montjoie (mont and joie) may be the name of the hill where the saint met his death; or it may signify that any such place is a "hill of joy.")</p> 
<p>"Marry and amen, and in a most happy hour!" said the martial Dunois; and the guards in the hall, unable to resist the same impulse, stirred each upon his post, so as to produce a low but distinct sound of clashing arms. The King cast his eye proudly round, and, for a moment, thought and looked like his heroic father.</p> 
<p>But the excitement of the moment presently gave way to the host of political considerations, which, at that conjuncture, rendered an open breach with Burgundy so peculiarly perilous. Edward IV, a brave and victorious king, who had in his own person fought thirty battles, was now established on the throne of England, was brother to the Duchess of Burgundy, and, it might well be supposed, waited but a rupture between his near connexion and Louis, to carry into France, through the ever open gate of Calais, those arms which had been triumphant in the English civil wars, and to obliterate the recollection of internal dissensions by that most popular of all occupations amongst the English, an invasion of France. To this consideration was added the uncertain faith of the Duke of Bretagne, and other weighty subjects of reflection. So that, after a deep pause, when Louis again spoke, although in the same tone, it was with an altered spirit. "But God forbid," he said, "that aught less than necessity should make us, the Most Christian' King, give cause to the effusion of Christian blood, if anything short of dishonour may avert such a calamity. We tender our subjects' safety dearer than the ruffle which our own dignity may receive from the rude breath of a malapert ambassador, who hath perhaps exceeded the errand with which he was charged. -- Admit the Envoy of Burgundy to our presence."</p> 
<p>"Beati pacifici, (blessed are the peace makers)" said the Cardinal Balue.</p> 
<p>"True; and your Eminence knoweth that they who humble themselves shall be exalted," added the King.</p> 
<p>The Cardinal spoke an Amen, to which few assented, for even the pale cheek of Orleans kindled with shame, and Balafre suppressed his feelings so little, as to let the butt end of his partisan fall heavily on the floor -- a movement of impatience for which he underwent a bitter reproof from the Cardinal, with a lecture on the mode of handling his arms when in presence of the Sovereign. The King himself seemed unusually embarrassed at the silence around him.</p> 
<p>"You are pensive, Dunois," he said. "You disapprove of our giving way to this hot headed Envoy."</p> 
<p>"By no means,"' said Dunois; "I meddle not with matters beyond my sphere. I was thinking of asking a boon of your Majesty."</p> 
<p>"A boon, Dunois -- what is it? You are an unfrequent suitor, and may count on our favour."</p> 
<p>"I would, then, your Majesty would send me to Evreux to regulate the clergy," said Dunois, with military frankness.</p> 
<p>"That were indeed beyond thy sphere," replied the King, smiling.</p> 
<p>"I might order priests as well," replied the Count, "as my Lord Bishop of Evreux, or my Lord Cardinal, if he likes the title better, can exercise the soldiers of your Majesty's guard."</p> 
<p>The King smiled again, and more mysteriously, while he whispered Dunois, "The time may come when you and I will regulate the priests together. -- But this is for the present a good conceited animal of a Bishop. Ah, Dunois! Rome, Rome puts him and other burdens upon us. -- But patience, cousin, and shuffle the cards, till our hand is a stronger one."</p> 
<p>(Dr. Dryasdust here remarks that cards, said to have been invented in a preceding reign, for the amusement of Charles V during the intervals of his mental disorder, seem speedily to have become common among the courtiers. . . . The alleged origin of the invention of cards produced one of the shrewdest replies I have ever heard given in evidence. It was made by the late Dr. Gregory of Edinburgh to a counsel of great eminence at the Scottish bar. The Doctor's testimony went to prove the insanity of the party whose mental capacity was the point at issue. On a cross interrogation, he admitted that the person in question played admirably at whist. "And do you seriously say, doctor," said the learned counsel, "that a person having a superior capacity for a game so difficult, and which requires in a preeminent degree, memory, judgment, and combination, can be at the same time deranged in his understanding?" -- "I am no card player," said the doctor, with great address, "but I have read in history that cards were invented for the amusement of an insane king." The consequences of this reply were decisive. S.)</p> 
<p>The flourish of trumpets in the courtyard now announced the arrival of the Burgundian nobleman. All in the presence chamber made haste to arrange themselves according to their proper places of precedence, the King and his daughters remaining in the centre of the assembly.</p> 
<p>The Count of Crevecoeur, a renowned and undaunted warrior, entered the apartment; and, contrary to the usage among the envoys of friendly powers, he appeared all armed, excepting his head, in a gorgeous suit of the most superb Milan armour, made of steel, inlaid and embossed with gold, which was wrought into the fantastic taste called the Arabesque. Around his neck and over his polished cuirass, hung his master's order of the Golden Fleece, one of the most honoured associations of chivalry then known in Christendom. A handsome page bore his helmet behind him, a herald preceded him, bearing his letters of credence which he offered on his knee to the King; while the ambassador himself paused in the midst of the hall, as if to give all present time to admire his lofty look, commanding stature, and undaunted composure of countenance and manner. The rest of his attendants waited in the antechamber, or courtyard.</p> 
<p>(The military order of the Golden Fleece was instituted by Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, in the year 1429, the King of Spain being grand master of the order, as Duke of Burgundy.)</p> 
<p>"Approach, Seignior Count de Crevecoeur," said Louis, after a moment's glance at his commission; "we need not our cousin's letters of credence, either to introduce to us a warrior so well known, or to assure us of your highly deserved credit with your master. We trust that your fair partner, who shares some of our ancestral blood, is in good health. Had you brought her in your hand, Seignior Count, we might have thought you wore your armour, on this unwonted occasion, to maintain the superiority of her charms against the amorous chivalry of France. As it is, we cannot guess the reason of this complete panoply."</p> 
<p>"Sire," replied the ambassador, "the Count of Crevecoeur must lament his misfortune, and entreat your forgiveness, that he cannot, on this occasion, reply with such humble deference as is due to the royal courtesy with which your Majesty has honoured him. But, although it is only the voice of Philip Crevecoeur de Cordes which speaks, the words which he utters must be those of his gracious Lord and Sovereign, the Duke of Burgundy."</p> 
<p>"And what has Crevecoeur to say in the words of Burgundy?" said Louis, with an assumption of sufficient dignity. "Yet hold -- remember, that in this presence, Philip Crevecoeur de Cordes speaks to him who is his Sovereign's Sovereign."</p> 
<p>Crevecoeur bowed, and then spoke aloud: "King of France, the mighty Duke of Burgundy once more sends you a written schedule of the wrongs and oppressions committed on his frontiers by your Majesty's garrisons and officers; and the first point of inquiry is, whether it is your Majesty's purpose to make him amends for these injuries?"</p> 
<p>The King, looking slightly at the memorial which the herald delivered to him upon his knee, said, "These matters have been already long before our Council. Of the injuries complained of, some are in requital of those sustained by my subjects, some are affirmed without any proof, some have been retaliated by the Duke's garrisons and soldiers; and if there remain any which fall under none of those predicaments, we are not, as a Christian prince, averse to make satisfaction for wrongs actually sustained by our neighbour, though committed not only without our countenance, but against our express order."'</p> 
<p>"I will convey your Majesty's answer," said the ambassador, "to my most gracious master; yet, let me say, that, as it is in no degree different from the evasive replies which have already been returned to his just complaints, I cannot hope that it will afford the means of re-establishing peace and friendship betwixt France and Burgundy."</p> 
<p>"Be that at God's pleasure," said the King. "It is not for dread of thy master's arms, but for the sake of peace only, that I return so temperate an answer to his injurious reproaches. Proceed with thine errand."</p> 
<p>"My master's next demand," said the ambassador, "is that your Majesty will cease your secret and underhand dealings with his towns of Ghent, Liege, and Malines. He requests that your Majesty will recall the secret agents by whose means the discontents of his good citizens of Flanders are inflamed; and dismiss from your Majesty's dominions, or rather deliver up to the condign punishment of their liege lord, those traitorous fugitives, who, having fled from the scene of their machinations, have found too ready a refuge in Paris, Orleans, Tours, and other French cities."</p> 
<p>"Say to the Duke of Burgundy," replied the King, "that I know of no such indirect practices as those with which he injuriously charges me; that many subjects of France have frequent intercourse with the good cities of Flanders, for the purpose of mutual benefit by free traffic, which it would be as much contrary to the Duke's interest as mine to interrupt; and that many Flemings have residence in my kingdom, and enjoy the protection of my laws, for the same purpose; but none, to our knowledge, for those of treason or mutiny against the Duke. Proceed with your message -- you have heard my answer."</p> 
<p>"As formerly, Sire, with pain," replied the Count of Crevecoeur; "it not being of that direct or explicit nature which the Duke, my master, will accept, in atonement for a long train of secret machinations, not the less certain, though now disavowed by your Majesty. But I proceed with my message. The Duke of Burgundy farther requires the King of France to send back to his dominions without delay, and under a secure safeguard, the persons of Isabelle Countess of Croye, and of her relation and guardian the Countess Hameline, of the same family, in respect the said Countess Isabelle, being, by the law of the country and the feudal tenure of her estates, the ward of the said Duke of Burgundy, hath fled from his dominions, and from the charge which he, as a careful guardian, was willing to extend over her, and is here maintained in secret by the King of France and by him fortified in her contumacy to the Duke, her natural lord and guardian, contrary to the laws of God and man, as they ever have been acknowledged in civilized Europe. -- Once more I pause for your Majesty's reply."</p> 
<p>"You did well, Count de Crevecoeur," said Louis, scornfully, "to begin your embassy at an early hour; for if it be your purpose to call on me to account for the flight of every vassal whom your master's heady passion may have driven from his dominions, the head roll may last till sunset. Who can affirm that these ladies are in my dominions? who can presume to say, if it be so, that I have either countenanced their flight hither, or have received them with offers of protection? Nay, who is it will assert, that, if they are in France, their place of retirement is within my knowledge?"</p> 
<p>"Sire," said Crevecoeur, "may it please your Majesty, I was provided with a witness on this subject -- one who beheld these fugitive ladies in the inn called the Fleur de Lys, not far from this Castle -- one who saw your Majesty in their company, though under the unworthy disguise of a burgess of Tours -- one who received from them, in your royal presence, messages and letters to their friends in Flanders -- all which he conveyed to the hand and ear of the Duke of Burgundy."</p> 
<p>"Bring them forward," said the King; "place the man before my face who dares maintain these palpable falsehoods."</p> 
<p>"You speak in triumph, my lord, for you are well aware that this witness no longer exists. When he lived, he was called Zamet Magraubin, by birth one of those Bohemian wanderers. He was yesterday -- as I have learned -- executed by a party of your Majesty's Provost Marshal, to prevent, doubtless, his standing here to verify what he said of this matter to the Duke of Burgundy, in presence of his Council, and of me, Philip Crevecoeur de Cordes."</p> 
<p>"Now, by Our Lady of Embrun," said the King, "so gross are these accusations, and so free of consciousness am I of aught that approaches them, that, by the honour of a King, I laugh, rather than am wroth at them. My Provost guard daily put to death, as is their duty, thieves and vagabonds; and is my crown to be slandered with whatever these thieves and vagabonds may have said to our hot cousin of Burgundy and his wise counsellors? I pray you, tell my kind cousin, if he loves such companions, he had best keep them in his own estates; for here they are like to meet short shrift and a tight cord."</p> 
<p>"My master needs no such subjects, Sir King," answered the Count, in a tone more disrespectful than he had yet permitted himself to make use of; "for the noble Duke uses not to inquire of witches, wandering Egyptians, or others, upon the destiny and fate of his neighbours and allies."</p> 
<p>"We have had patience enough, and to spare," said the King, interrupting him; "and since thy sole errand here seems to be for the purpose of insult, we will send some one in our name to the Duke of Burgundy -- convinced, in thus demeaning thyself towards us, thou hast exceeded thy commission, whatever that may have been."</p> 
<p>"On the contrary," said Crevecoeur, "I have not yet acquitted myself of it -- Hearken, Louis of Valois, King of France -- Hearken, nobles and gentlemen, who may be present. -- Hearken, all good and true men. -- And thou, Toison d'Or," addressing the herald, "make proclamation after me. -- I, Philip Crevecoeur of Cordes, Count of the Empire, and Knight of the honourable and princely Order of the Golden Fleece, in the name of the most puissant Lord and Prince, Charles, by the grace of God, Duke of Burgundy and Lotharingia, of Brabant and Limbourg, of Luxembourg and of Gueldres; Earl of Flanders and of Artois; Count Palatine of Hainault, of Holland, Zealand, Namur, and Zutphen; Marquis of the Holy Empire; Lord of Friezeland, Salines, and Malines, do give you, Louis, King of France, openly to know, that you, having refused to remedy the various griefs, wrongs, and offences, done and wrought by you, or by and through your aid, suggestion, and instigation, against the said Duke and his loving subjects, he, by my mouth, renounces all allegiance and fealty towards your crown and dignity -- pronounces you false and faithless; and defies you as a Prince, and as a man. There lies my gage, in evidence of what I have said."</p> 
<p>So saying, he plucked the gauntlet off his right hand, and flung it down on the floor of the hall.</p> 
<p>Until this last climax of audacity, there had been a deep silence in the royal apartment during the extraordinary scene; but no sooner had the clash of the gauntlet, when cast down, been echoed by the deep voice of Toison d'Or, the Burgundian herald, with the ejaculation, "Vive Bourgogne!" than there was a general tumult. While Dunois, Orleans, old Lord Crawford, and one or two others, whose rank authorized their interference, contended which should lift up the gauntlet, the others in the hall exclaimed, "Strike him down! Cut him to pieces! Comes he here to insult the King of France in his own palace?"</p> 
<p>But the King appeased the tumult by exclaiming, in a voice like thunder, which overawed and silenced every other sound, "Silence, my lieges, lay not a hand on the man, not a finger on the gage! -- And you, Sir Count, of what is your life composed, or how is it warranted, that you thus place it on the cast of a die so perilous? or is your Duke made of a different metal from other princes, since he thus asserts his pretended quarrel in a manner so unusual?"</p> 
<p>"He is indeed framed of a different and more noble metal than the other princes of Europe," said the undaunted Count of Crevecoeur; "for, when not one of them dared to give shelter to you -- to you, I say, King Louis -- when you were yet only Dauphin, an exile from France, and pursued by the whole bitterness of your father's revenge, and all the power of his kingdom, you were received and protected like a brother by my noble master, whose generosity of disposition you have so grossly misused. Farewell, Sire, my mission is discharged."</p> 
<p>So saying, the Count de Crevecoeur left the apartment abruptly, and without farther leave taking.</p> 
<p>"After him -- after him -- take up the gauntlet and after him!" said the King. "I mean not you, Dunois, nor you, my Lord of Crawford, who, methinks, may be too old for such hot frays; nor you, cousin of Orleans, who are too young for them. -- My Lord Cardinal -- my Lord Bishop of Auxerre -- it is your holy office to make peace among princes; do you lift the gauntlet, and remonstrate with Count Crevecoeur on the sin he has committed, in thus insulting a great monarch in his own Court, and forcing us to bring the miseries of war upon his kingdom, and that of his neighbour."</p> 
<p>Upon this direct personal appeal, the Cardinal Balue proceeded to lift the gauntlet, with such precaution as one would touch an adder -- so great was apparently his aversion to this symbol of war -- and presently left the royal apartment to hasten after the challenger.</p> 
<p>Louis paused and looked round the circle of his courtiers, most of whom, except such as we have already distinguished, being men of low birth, and raised to their rank in the King's household for other gifts than courage or feats of arms, looked pale on each other, and had obviously received an unpleasant impression from the scene which had been just acted. Louis gazed on them with contempt, and then said aloud, "Although the Count of Crevecoeur be presumptuous and overweening, it must be confessed that in him the Duke of Burgundy hath as bold a servant as ever bore message for a prince. I would I knew where to find as faithful an Envoy to carry back my answer."</p> 
<p>"You do your French nobles injustice, Sire," said Dunois; "not one of them but would carry a defiance to Burgundy on the point of his sword."</p> 
<p>"And, Sire," said old Crawford, "you wrong also the Scottish gentlemen who serve you. I, or any of my followers, being of meet rank, would not hesitate a moment to call yonder proud Count to a reckoning; my own arm is yet strong enough for the purpose, if I have but your Majesty's permission."</p> 
<p>"But your Majesty," continued Dunois, "will employ us in no service through which we may win honour to ourselves, to your Majesty, or to France."</p> 
<p>"Say rather," said the King, "that I will not give way, Dunois, to the headlong impetuosity, which, on some punctilio of chivalry, would wreck yourselves, the throne, France, and all. There is not one of you who knows not how precious every hour of peace is at this moment, when so necessary to heal the wounds of a distracted country; yet there is not one of you who would not rush into war on account of the tale of a wandering gipsy, or of some errant damosel, whose reputation, perhaps, is scarce higher. -- Here comes the Cardinal, and we trust with more pacific tidings. -- How now, my Lord, -- have you brought the Count to reason and to temper?"</p> 
<p>"Sire," said Balue, "my task hath been difficult. I put it to yonder proud Count, how he dared to use towards your Majesty the presumptuous reproach with which his audience had broken up, and which must be understood as proceeding, not from his master, but from his own insolence, and as placing him therefore in your Majesty's discretion for what penalty you might think proper."</p> 
<p>"You said right," replied the King; "and what was his answer?"</p> 
<p>"The Count," continued the Cardinal, "had at that moment his foot in the stirrup, ready to mount; and, on hearing my expostulation, he turned his head without altering his position. 'Had I,' said he, 'been fifty leagues distant, and had heard by report that a question vituperative of my Prince had been asked by the King of France, I had, even at that distance, instantly mounted, and returned to disburden my mind of the answer which I gave him but now.'"</p> 
<p>"I said, sirs," said the King, turning around, without any show of angry emotion, "that in the Count Philip of Crevecoeur, our cousin the Duke possesses as worthy a servant as ever rode at a prince's right hand. -- But you prevailed with him to stay?"</p> 
<p>"To stay for twenty-four hours; and in the meanwhile to receive again his gage of defiance," said the Cardinal; "he has dismounted at the Fleur de Lys."</p> 
<p>"See that he be nobly attended and cared for, at our charges," said the King; "such a servant is a jewel in a prince's crown. Twenty-four hours?" he added, muttering to himself, and looking as if he were stretching his eyes to see into futurity; "twenty-four hours? It is of the shortest. Yet twenty-four hours, ably and skilfully employed, may be worth a year in the hand of indolent or incapable agents. -- Well -- to the forest -- to the forest, my gallant lords! -- Orleans, my fair kinsman, lay aside that modesty, though it becomes you; mind not my Joan's coyness. The Loire may as soon avoid mingling with the Cher, as she from favouring your suit, or you from preferring it," he added, as the unhappy prince moved slowly on after his betrothed bride. "And now for your boar spears, gentlemen -- for Allegre, my pricker, hath harboured one that will try both dog and man. -- Dunois, lend me your spear -- take mine, it is too weighty for me; but when did you complain of such a fault in your lance? -- To horse -- to horse, gentlemen."</p> 
<p>And all the chase rode on.</p> 
<p>愿你在法国人眼中快如闪电，</p> 
<p>因为，当你还来不及宣告我的到来，</p> 
<p>我大炮的轰鸣将已被人听见——</p> 
<p>去吧，愿你充当我们愤怒的号角。</p> 
<p>《约翰王》</p> 
<p>即使懒惰是达威特很易犯的过错，那么在第一次晨钟敲过之后，卫队营房的喧闹声也肯定会驱走睡梦的妖魔。然而，在老家的塔楼里受过的父亲的管教和阿伯布罗迪克修道院里的纪律训练已使他习惯于清晨早起。他愉快地穿上衣服；周围是一片号角声和兵器的碰撞声，说明警卫战士正在换岗——有的站完夜岗后正在返回营地，有的正列队前去站早岗——而另一些人，包括他舅父，则正在整理军容以便直接为路易王担任警卫。昆丁·达威特怀着年轻人在这种场合都会产生的一种心情，穿戴上适合他新的身份的华贵的衣服和装备。他舅父十分严格而关切地打量着他，力求他的穿戴各方面都完美无缺。看到他外甥的仪表焕然一新，他掩饰不住满意的表情。“要是你既漂亮，又勇敢忠诚，那么我将会看到你成为卫队最英俊最优秀的扈从之一，而这不能不说是在为你母亲的家族增光。跟我到觐见厅去吧。要注意紧靠在我的身边。”</p> 
<p>接着他拿起一把装饰得很美丽的沉重大戟，并吩咐他外甥也拿一把较轻的，然后和他一道走进宫殿的内院。有几个将去担任内室警卫的卫士已全副武装地排在那里——屈从都站在主人的后面，组成第二个行列。侍候国王的还有牵着骏马和名狗的若干名助猎兵。昆丁愉快而好奇地望着他们。他舅舅不得不一再提醒他，这些动物不是供他消遣的，而是供国王消遣的。国王非常爱好打猎，即使在冥思苦想策谋划略的时候，这也是他从不放弃的少数爱好之一。他如此严格地保护皇家森林中的猎物，以致流行一种说法，即杀死一头公鹿要比杀死一个人受的惩罚更重。</p> 
<p>作为值勤官的勒·巴拉弗雷一声令下，卫队便立即行动起来。从交代了的繁琐的信号和口令中，足见其执行职责的高度准确性和警觉性。他们列队进入觐见厅，在那儿人们正恭候国王随时驾到。</p> 
<p>尽管昆丁对富丽堂皇的场面很陌生，但他眼见的一切却远远赶不上他原来的想象，使他颇为失望。不错，在场的有装束华丽的王室官员，有雄赳赳的武装卫士，有各级仆役。然而他没看见提供国事咨询的老人和高级皇家官员，没听见任何曾使得当代骑士闻之胆寒的英雄们的名字，也没看见任何年富力强，不愧为法国中坚人物的将军和领袖，以及追求荣誉，不愧为法国之骄傲的年轻而热情的贵族。国王猜忌的秉性，含蓄的态度以及深沉而狡黠的谋略使得这一优秀的阶层与王室关系疏远。他们只是在某些指定的正式场合才被国王召见。他们去时很勉强，回来时却很高兴，和寓言里的动物走进虎穴和离开虎穴时的心情十分相似。</p> 
<p>呆在那里像是作咨询的少数几个人也都相貌平平。他们脸上偶尔也带有某种聪明的表情，但其仪态却表明他们是走进了一个与他们过去受的教养很不相称的社会圈子。其中有一两个在达威特看来倒是仪表堂堂，而眼前的守卫也没有严格到妨碍他舅父把他认为突出的几位人物的大名一一告诉他。</p> 
<p>对于穿着华丽的制服，手持银杖，也在场的克劳福德大公，昆丁也和读者一样已很熟悉。在另一些看来很有身份的人物当中最突出的是杜诺瓦伯爵。他是人们称之为“私生的奥尔良”的名将杜诺瓦的儿子。杜诺瓦曾在圣女贞德麾下作战，在使法国摆脱英国奴役的过程中起过杰出的作用。他的儿子没有辜负如此高贵的父辈留给他的英名。虽然杜诺瓦和王室有亲缘关系，在贵族和平民中都享有世袭的声誉，但他在各种场合都表现出一种坦率而忠诚的性格，因而任何人甚至连猜忌心很强的路易，都不会对他有所顾忌。路易很喜欢让他接近自己，有时也把他叫来当当参谋。虽然在骑士操行的各个方面他都算得上完美无缺，并具有当时人们称为模范骑士的许多品德，但这伯爵的面貌却远不是什么浪漫的美男子典型。虽然体格健壮，但他个子比一般人还矮，两腿有些向外弯曲，这对骑马来说更为方便，可走起路来却不那么美观。他有着宽肩、黑发、黝黑的脸色、修长而爱摆动的双臂，五官很不端正，近乎丑陋。然而，不管怎么说，杜诺瓦伯爵却具有一种意识到自己价值的高贵气派，使人一眼就看出他那种贵族后裔和英勇武士的品质。他的表情大胆而刚直，步履矫健而自然，鹰一般的目光和狮子般的皱纹使得他严峻的面孔更显威严。他穿着一套打猎服，华美而不俗丽。在大多数场合下他都扮演狩猎大臣的角色，不过我们并不相信这是他真正的职务。</p> 
<p>倚着亲属杜诺瓦的胳膊站着的是被封为奥尔良公爵的路易。他是皇族第一亲王（以后成为法王路易十二）。警卫和侍从都向他行礼致敬。他迈着如此缓慢而沉郁的步子，以致他像是靠在扶着他的那位亲属身上。在国王别无后嗣的情况下亲王就将继承王位，所以他一直受到路易王小心翼翼的守护。路易不许他离开宫廷一步。他成天幽居深宫，既不让他有所作为，也不给他任何鼓励。这卑贱而近乎囚徒的处境自然使这位不幸的亲王举止之间流露出沮丧的表情。由于他意识到国王正在考虑对他采取一个暴君可能采取的最残忍最不公正的行动，他这种沮丧的表情此刻更是表露无遗。所说的这个行动指的是胁迫他娶路易的小女儿，法国的让娜公主为妻。固然在孩提时他已和她订了婚约，但公主的畸形外表却使得坚持这一婚约成为一种可憎的强制行径。</p> 
<p>这位不幸的亲王外貌并不出众，但内心却温顺而善良。这些素质是透过那掩盖着他天性的异常沮丧的外表中看出的。昆丁注意到这位公爵有意不向国王的卫队张望一眼，并且在他还礼时也两眼朝下，仿佛他害怕国王的猜忌会把一个平常的还礼姿态曲解成有意在卫队中树立个人威望。</p> 
<p>高傲的红衣主教高级教士巴卢·约翰却表现得大不相同。他当时是路易王的宠臣。如果说奸诈多谋的法王路易和卤莽急躁的英王亨利第八之间的差异容许我们作一个比较的话，那么此人发迹的历史及其性格的确和沃尔塞的历史非常相似。路易王把这位宠臣从一个卑贱的人提升到法国赈济大臣的显赫地位（至少让他享有其俸禄），还给了他许许多多优厚待遇，甚至给他戴上了红衣主教的冠冕。虽然他十分审慎，并不像亨利第八对待沃尔塞那样，把无限的权力和信任给予这个野心勃勃的巴卢，但此人却比别的自封的谋臣对他具有更大的影响力。因此这位红衣主教未能避免卑贱者突然升为权贵时很容易犯的一个错误。他无疑被突然的飞黄腾达冲昏了头脑，竟自信有资格干预一切事务，甚至与自己职业和学识毫不相干的事务。他个子高高，样子笨拙，却喜欢对女性表示爱慕，并大献殷勤，尽管他的态度使得他的借口显得荒谬，而他的职业也让这些借口显得不成体统。有几个讨好他的男人或女人曾不幸使他鬼迷心窍地自以为继承了他父亲（原在里莫日赶马车，或另据别的一种说法，曾在凡尔登开磨坊）一双轮廓优美的大腿。这念头搞得他神魂颠倒，以致他总是要把红衣主教的僧袍稍稍拉向一边，好让人看见他那双粗壮的大腿。当他穿着红衣和华丽的罩袍神气地走过大厅的时候，他一再停下来欣赏站岗的骑士们的武器和装备，以权威的口吻问他们几个问题，并擅自以所谓的不合年纪为理由责备几个卫士。这些有经验的武士固然不敢口头回答他的指责，但他们显然对他很鄙视，很不耐烦。</p> 
<p>“国王清不清楚，”杜诺瓦对红衣主教说道，“勃艮第的特使要求他无条件接见？”</p> 
<p>“他已经知道了，”红衣主教回答说，“我想万能的奥利弗·丹进来就是要告诉我们国王的意向。”</p> 
<p>他正说着的时候，一位与红衣主教分享路易王恩宠的大人物从内室走了出来，但他没有那位教会人士借以显示威风和尊严的要人气派。相反，他是个苍白瘦弱的小个子，在黑绸紧身衣裤外面没穿外套、披风和罩袍。普通的衣着自然很难改善他那平庸的外表。他手上拿着一个银盆，胳膊上挂着一条理发的围巾，表明他是个卑微的剃头匠。他的面孔具有锐利和善变的表情，但他总是眼睛盯在地上，竭力想把它从脸上抹掉，不让人看见。他的步子像猫的一样悄然无声，因此他像是谦卑地溜过大厅而不是走过大厅。然而，尽管谦卑容易使人忽视一个人的价值，却不能掩盖一个人在宫廷所受的恩宠。奥利弗·丹有时也被人叫做坏蛋奥利弗，或魔鬼奥利弗。这些都是由于他帮助国王执行其鬼蜮伎俩所表现出的奸诈而赢得的绰号。既然他是国王闻名的理发师和仆役，并已成为国王的亲信，他想悄悄溜过觐见厅的尝试自然是徒劳的。他和杜诺瓦伯爵严肃地谈了片刻。只见那位伯爵顿时离开了大厅，而这位剃头匠则朝他刚走出来的国王起居室溜了回去。在场的都赶忙给他让路。他只是以谦恭的鞠躬作为还礼。惟一的例外是他对一两个人耳语了一句，从而使得他们成为其他朝臣们的羡慕对象；但他一边嘀咕着说，他职责在身，有事要办，以避开他们的答话，以及想引他的注意、急切向他求情的企图。卢德维克·莱斯利也是有幸听到奥利弗对自己耳语的人之一。这句耳语是叫他放心；他的事情已幸运地得到解决。</p> 
<p>不久又再次证实了这个好消息。昆丁的老相识，皇家军法总监特里斯顿·勒尔米特走进大厅后径直来到勒巴拉弗雷所站的地方。这位可畏的军官的华丽制服只是使得他那阴森的脸色和凶恶的面部表情显得更为突出。他那本想表示和解的声调也颇像熊的嗥叫。不过他讲话的内容倒要比他说话的声音友好一些。他对他们之间前一天发生的误会表示遗憾。他说这是因为勒巴拉弗雷先生的外甥没有穿卫队的制服，也没有说明他已参加卫队，从而使他犯了这个错误，为此他请求原谅。</p> 
<p>卢德维克·莱斯利作了一个必不可少的回答。一当特里斯顿转身走掉，他便对外甥说，他们很荣幸，从此有了这样一个可畏的军官作他们的死对头。“不过他的打击够不着我们，”他说道，“一个，洛尽职守的士兵尽可以嘲笑军法总监。”</p> 
<p>昆丁也禁不住抱有和他舅父同样的看法，因为当特里斯顿离开他们的时候，此人的眼睛里放射出仿佛是被长矛戳伤的熊投射在猎人身上那种愤怒而凶恶的目光。要知道，即使在不那么激动的情况下，这位军官阴沉的眼神也表现出一种恶意，足以使人接触他的目光时害怕得发抖。年轻的苏格兰人这时产生的毛骨悚然的感觉就更强烈更可怕，因为他似乎仍然感到这位和他有仇的军官的两名绞刑吏还在牢牢地抓着他的肩膀。</p> 
<p>奥利弗像我们刚才描绘过的那样鬼鬼祟祟地在房里转了一圈——在场的人，即使地位最高的大臣，都纷纷为他让道，以表示无限的敬意，而他却谦逊地竭力躲开这些亲昵的表示——然后又走回内室。隔不多久内室的门便豁然敞开，觐见厅里的人们看见路易工走了进来。</p> 
<p>昆丁也像别人那样把眼睛转过去望着他。他猛然一惊，差点把长戟掉在地上。他一眼就认出，原来法国国王就是昨天早上和他在一起的那位丝绸商皮埃尔老爷。对于这人的真正身份他脑子里不止一次产生过奇怪的猜疑，然而已见分晓的真实情况却比他最离奇的猜测更为离奇。</p> 
<p>他舅父对他这一失礼的表现很生气，狠狠地瞪了他一眼，从而使他镇定过来。然而目光敏捷的国王立刻认出他，不理睬别人而径直向他走来，他更是大为吃惊。“喂，年轻人，”他说道，“我听说你一到都兰就闹事。不过，我原谅你，因为这主要是一个愚蠢的老商人的过错。他以为有必要在早晨用波尔尼酒暖暖你那苏格兰人的热血。要是我能找到他，我将惩罚他，作为对那些敢于腐蚀我的卫队的人们的一种告诫。巴拉弗雷，”他对莱斯利补充说道，“你外甥是个漂亮的小伙子，不过火气很大。我很愿意培养这种精神，也打算比以往更看重我周围的勇士。你把你外甥的生辰年月写下来交给奥利弗·丹。”</p> 
<p>勒巴拉弗雷深深地鞠了一躬，然后重新摆好军人的立正姿势，像是要以此表示他随时准备为国王效忠。昆丁也已经从原先的惊奇中镇定下来，开始更仔细地打量国王的外表。当他发现他现在对国王的举止和仪容的看法与他们初次见面时多么不同，不禁又感到十分惊讶。</p> 
<p>表面看来这一切并没有很大的变化，因为路易王经常嘲笑人们炫耀外表。眼下这个场合他也只是穿着比前一天那件普通平民服好不了多少的深蓝色猎人装，佩戴着一大串马木念珠。这串念珠是“太君”这样一个了不起的人物赠送给他的礼品，据说是黎巴嫩山上一个十分圣洁的埃及基督教隐士使用过的遗物。他头上戴的是顶帽边上至少饰有一打铅制小圣徒像的礼帽，而不是那顶只饰有一个圣母像的便帽。然而，昆丁原先觉得只是闪烁着贪欲的那双眼睛，一旦他知道是属于一位能干而强有力的君主，便觉得更加犀利与威严。他额上的那些皱纹，原以为是长期琐屑地盘算生意经留下的印迹，现在却成了为国运操劳而留下的智慧的印痕。</p> 
<p>国王刚上朝不久，“法国公主”也在她们侍女的伴随下来到大厅。就后来嫁给了波旁·彼得而在法国历史上称之为“博若小姐”的长公主来说，我们这本小说与她关系不大。她个子高大，相当漂亮，具有口才和文才以及得自父亲的那种明智，是她父亲十分信赖、也可能最喜爱的女儿。</p>
