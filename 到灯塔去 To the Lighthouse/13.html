He had seen the Rembrandts. He had been toMadrid. Unfortunately, it was Good Friday and the Prado was shut. Hehad been to Rome. Had Miss Briscoe never been to Rome? Oh, sheshould—It would be a wonderful experience for her—the Sistine Chapel;Michael Angelo; and Padua, with its Giottos. His wife had been in badhealth for many years, so that their sight-seeing had been on a modestscale.</p> 
<p>　　She had been to Brussels; she had been to Paris but only for a flyingvisit to see an aunt who was ill. She had been to Dresden; there weremasses of pictures she had not seen; however, Lily Briscoe reflected, perhapsit was better not to see pictures: they only made one hopelessly discontentedwith one's own work. Mr Bankes thought one could carry thatpoint of view too far. We can't all be Titians and we can't all be Darwins,he said; at the same time he doubted whether you could have your Darwinand your Titian if it weren't for humble people like ourselves. Lilywould have liked to pay him a compliment; you're not humble, MrBankes, she would have liked to have said. But he did not want compliments(most men do, she thought), and she was a little ashamed of herimpulse and said nothing while he remarked that perhaps what he wassaying did not apply to pictures. Anyhow, said Lily, tossing off her littleinsincerity, she would always go on painting, because it interested her.</p> 
<p>　　Yes, said Mr Bankes, he was sure she would, and, as they reached theend of the lawn he was asking her whether she had difficulty in findingsubjects in London when they turned and saw the Ramsays. So that ismarriage, Lily thought, a man and a woman looking at a girl throwing aball. That is what Mrs Ramsay tried to tell me the other night, shethought. For she was wearing a green shawl, and they were standingclose together watching Prue and Jasper throwing catches. And suddenlythe meaning which, for no reason at all, as perhaps they are steppingout of the Tube or ringing a doorbell, descends on people, making them symbolical, making them representative, came upon them, andmade them in the dusk standing, looking, the symbols of marriage, husbandand wife. Then, after an instant, the symbolical outline which transcendedthe real figures sank down again, and they became, as they metthem, Mr and Mrs Ramsay watching the children throwing catches. Butstill for a moment, though Mrs Ramsay greeted them with her usualsmile (oh, she's thinking we're going to get married, Lily thought) andsaid, "I have triumphed tonight," meaning that for once Mr Bankes hadagreed to dine with them and not run off to his own lodging where hisman cooked vegetables properly; still, for one moment, there was a senseof things having been blown apart, of space, of irresponsibility as the ballsoared high, and they followed it and lost it and saw the one star and thedraped branches. In the failing light they all looked sharp-edged and etherealand divided by great distances. Then, darting backwards over thevast space (for it seemed as if solidity had vanished altogether), Prue ranfull tilt into them and caught the ball brilliantly high up in her left hand,and her mother said, "Haven't they come back yet?" whereupon the spellwas broken. Mr Ramsay felt free now to laugh out loud at the thoughtthat Hume had stuck in a bog and an old woman rescued him on conditionhe said the Lord's Prayer, and chuckling to himself he strolled off tohis study. Mrs Ramsay, bringing Prue back into throwing catches again,from which she had escaped, asked,"Did Nancy go with them?"</p>
