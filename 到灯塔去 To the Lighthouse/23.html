What people had shed and left—a pair ofshoes, a shooting cap, some faded skirts and coats in wardrobes—thosealone kept the human shape and in the emptiness indicated how oncethey were filled and animated; how once hands were busy with hooksand buttons; how once the looking-glass had held a face; had held aworld hollowed out in which a figure turned, a hand flashed, the dooropened, in came children rushing and tumbling; and went out again.</p> 
<p>　　Now, day after day, light turned, like a flower reflected in water, itssharp image on the wall opposite. Only the shadows of the trees, flourishingin the wind, made obeisance on the wall, and for a momentdarkened the pool in which light reflected itself; or birds, flying, made asoft spot flutter slowly across the bedroom floor.</p> 
<p>　　So loveliness reigned and stillness, and together made the shape ofloveliness itself, a form from which life had parted; solitary like a pool atevening, far distant, seen from a train window, vanishing so quickly thatthe pool, pale in the evening, is scarcely robbed of its solitude, thoughonce seen. Loveliness and stillness clasped hands in the bedroom, andamong the shrouded jugs and sheeted chairs even the prying of thewind, and the soft nose of the clammy sea airs, rubbing, snuffling, iterating,and reiterating their questions—"Will you fade? Will you perish?"—scarcely disturbed the peace, the indifference, the air of pure integrity,as if the question they asked scarcely needed that they should answer:</p> 
<p>　　we remain.</p> 
<p>　　Nothing it seemed could break that image, corrupt that innocence, ordisturb the swaying mantle of silence which, week after week, in theempty room, wove into itself the falling cries of birds, ships hooting, the drone and hum of the fields, a dog's bark, a man's shout, and foldedthem round the house in silence. Once only a board sprang on the landing;once in the middle of the night with a roar, with a rupture, as aftercenturies of quiescence, a rock rends itself from the mountain andhurtles crashing into the valley, one fold of the shawl loosened andswung to and fro. Then again peace descended; and the shadowwavered; light bent to its own image in adoration on the bedroom wall;and Mrs McNab, tearing the veil of silence with hands that had stood inthe wash-tub, grinding it with boots that had crunched the shingle, cameas directed to open all windows, and dust the bedrooms.</p>
