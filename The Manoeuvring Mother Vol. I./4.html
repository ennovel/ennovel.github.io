He arrived earlier at Wetheral than even Lady Wetheral could expect him, and her smiles were proportionably bland and expressive. Tom Pynsent would have detected and laughed at the affectionate reception which awaited him, had his heart been free to seek amusement in the hopes and fears of Lady Wetheral; but the scene was changed. The parent, anxious for a daughter's establishment, was, in Tom Pynsent's eyes, his prop and stay against the forthcoming proposal; and Lady Wetheral, the "well-known man?uvrer," was at this time only Julia's mother and his kind well-wisher. In short, Tom Pynsent was caught; [78] and, like other keen-sighted men of fortune, he was perfectly upon his guard, when no danger threatened his heart; but every firm resolution melted, when his eye was pleased, and his fancy gratified.
<br> 
<br> He was now on the eve of proposing to Julia Wetheral, in spite of his determination never to bow the knee to a Wetheral, or to be "hooked" by her ladyship's gracious compliments. Poor Tom Pynsent! he fell honourably at the very head of his thousand determinations never to visit Wetheral Castle but as an amusement, and never to flirt with a daughter of that house but as a means of raising false hopes in the lady mother's anxious bosom.
<br> "Men's faiths are wafer-cakes."
<br> 
<br> Lady Wetheral affected to be entirely ignorant of the cause of Tom Pynsent's early visit.
<br> 
<br> "Mr. Pynsent so very early in the field! it must indeed be a hunting appointment. Sir John will be delighted;" and she held out her hand, smiling a million agreeable welcomes. [79] "Where are my daughters? they did not expect you so soon, I dare say. Lord Ennismore has escorted them walking, probably."
<br> 
<br> Tom Pynsent was disappointed at Julia's absence, but he only looked bewildered.
<br> 
<br> "I wish to see Sir John as soon as possible, Lady Wetheral; I came early on purpose to see him; perhaps I may find him in his study; shall I proceed there?"
<br> 
<br> "By all means, my dear Mr. Pynsent, unless you allow me to summon Sir John to us. Am I de trop?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh! no, not that," answered Tom Pynsent, becoming somewhat disordered; "you will hear it in time, so you may as well be present, only—"
<br> 
<br> "Let me lead the way then, my dear Mr. Pynsent;" and she proceeded towards the door of the study. Sir John was seated in his arm-chair, looking over a package of new books; and, for a minute or two, he did not recognize Mr. Pynsent. Lady Wetheral was shocked.
<br> 
<br> "Sir John, you do not appear to remember [80] our friend Mr. Pynsent, who is anxious to see you. What is the study, my love, which so engrosses your faculties?"
<br> 
<br> Sir John rose, and received Tom Pynsent with his usual quiet politeness.
<br> 
<br> "I did not immediately recollect you, sir; I hope your family are well, Mr. Pynsent; be seated, if you please."
<br> 
<br> Tom Pynsent glanced at the chair which was advanced towards him, but he remained standing with a red face and an embarrassed manner.
<br> 
<br> "I hope all are well at Hatton," repeated Sir John, surprised by the silence of his companion.
<br> 
<br> Tom Pynsent could only comfortably entertain one idea at a time, and his present idea was exclusively the proposal he intended to make for Julia. The repetition, however, roused him from his embarrassment.
<br> 
<br> "Sir John, I'm come here for a very particular purpose." The plunge was made, and Tom Pynsent's voice and manner recovered their serenity. "I have something to say, Sir John, which I hope will not give offence. [81] I like Miss Julia very much; indeed I love and admire her extremely, and I wish to know if I have your leave to address her?"
<br> 
<br> Lady Wetheral threw looks and smiles at the speaker, which encouraged and delighted the lover; but Sir John was taken by surprise.
<br> 
<br> "Sir, you are—I am, I confess, a very little surprised. You say my daughter Julia, sir."
<br> 
<br> "I wish for your consent, Sir John, to address Miss Julia. I have spoken to her, and she did not altogether refuse me, as she laughed very much; but I think it right to speak to you upon the subject, that all things may be above-board."
<br> 
<br> "You are acting honourably and properly, Mr. Pynsent," returned Sir John, holding out his hand, which was seized by the warm-hearted Tom. He continued, "My daughter, Mr. Pynsent, must decide for herself, but, if she finds no reason to decline your proposal, I am quite ready to welcome you as my son-in-law."
<br> 
<br> Lady Wetheral went greater lengths in [82] speech than her husband, for her joy was uncontrollable.
<br> 
<br> "My dear Tom—for now I address you as my future son—my happiness will be perfect, should I ever visit you and my dear Julia at Hatton. It gives me unfeigned pleasure to think Julia has fixed her affections upon an object so truly worthy, and so acceptable to her own family. This is indeed to me a very happy moment."
<br> 
<br> "I will do every thing you wish in the settlement way, Sir John," said the honest-hearted suitor, his face almost purple with gratified feelings. "My father says he will relinquish Hatton to me directly; but I don't mean the governor to quit his own favourite place. Let him keep it for life, you know, for we young ones can move about. He will allow me to make a very handsome settlement upon my wife—any thing you suggest, Sir John."
<br> 
<br> Sir John was pleased by the open-hearted manner and matter, and his heart warmed to Tom Pynsent.
<br> 
<br> "Sir, I wish you well with my daughter, [83] and, if you succeed, we shall easily arrange the necessary form. You have my best wishes, for I like your sentiments, and your father, sir, may be proud of your heart. A good son is a sure promise of an indulgent husband, and I quite approve of your declining to allow your father to quit Hatton, Mr. Pynsent."
<br> 
<br> "Why, Sir John, there is but a right and wrong way of doing things—if a man does right, he goes on very well; and if he does wrong, why, he will be damned for it!"
<br> 
<br> The voices of Julia and Lord Ennismore, in playful tones, echoing through the hall, at this moment reached Tom Pynsent's ears. He became alarmed and nervous.
<br> 
<br> "I wish it was over, Sir John. I could wish to see Miss Julia now, and hear my fate at once. A man gets very awkward and nervous in this situation, I declare!" and Tom Pynsent's red face became ashy pale.
<br> 
<br> Lady Wetheral undertook to make his burthen an easy one. She even ventured to answer for Julia's affection—this was going too far. Julia had never confided her feelings [84] to her mother upon any subject, and Lady Wetheral's anxiety to secure Tom Pynsent led her into the commission of much injustice. She had sacrificed Anna Maria's peace by thoughtless man?uvring, and now she was creating false hopes in the heart of Tom Pynsent. His situation at this moment was pitiable, and Sir John at once decided upon the necessity of an immediate conference with Julia. Poor Julia obeyed the summons conveyed through Thompson, and appeared in the study brilliant in smiles, and glowing with her recent exercise. She was not surprised at seeing Tom Pynsent, though she did not expect him so early. Julia was never off her guard. No girl in existence possessed her perfect command of feelings, and her self-possessed manner which never deserted her under any circumstance. She was quite prepared for a scene with Tom Pynsent and her mother.
<br> 
<br> "My dear Julia," said her father, taking her hand, and seating her between Tom Pynsent and himself, "Mr. Pynsent has been here some little time, and he has been speaking [85] on a subject which you alone can dispose of."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, papa, I will dispose of it in one word," replied Julia, in her gayest manner. "What is it about?"
<br> 
<br> Tom Pynsent took up the matter as appertaining to himself, exclusively.
<br> 
<br> "Miss Julia, I have spoken to Sir John upon the subject of last night."
<br> 
<br> "Well, Mr. Pynsent."
<br> 
<br> "And, Sir John gives his consent, Miss Julia, if——."
<br> 
<br> "But I do not give mine, Mr. Pynsent."
<br> 
<br> Lady Wetheral sat rooted upon her chair; the fountain of her speech was dried up. Tom Pynsent coloured.
<br> 
<br> "You laughed at my remarks, Miss Julia, at the time, and that was not discouraging, I thought."
<br> 
<br> "There is no sentiment in a laugh, Mr. Pynsent, but I am sorry you misunderstood my manner. Excuse me, but I never can like you in any light but that of a pleasant acquaintance, and I hope you will not renew the subject. I laughed at your odd way of [86] broaching your subject last night, but I am sure I could not encourage you, for I left you, if you remember."
<br> 
<br> "You were very abrupt with me, Miss Julia, but I fancied you were only angry because I squeezed your hand."
<br> 
<br> Tom Pynsent turned scarlet as he spoke.
<br> 
<br> "Well, Mr. Pynsent, don't let us say another word on the subject, and pray don't worry me with complaints, for I am speaking my unchangeable sentiments when I say, any expostulation on your part will only make me dislike you; and I really like you very much as only Tom Pynsent, our pleasant neighbour."
<br> 
<br> "Why, there's only a right and wrong way of doing things," replied Tom Pynsent, rising; "and I have no idea of teazing a woman as if I was digging out a fox, to make her dread the sound of my voice. I wish you well, Miss Julia, and as you will never hear me complain of a woman who tells me plump she does not like me, you need not be afraid of meeting me sometimes. I like every body to be above-board, and say what they mean. I am very sorry to appear rude, [87] Sir John, but you will excuse my taking leave. I came upon a business which is settled, you know, so I had better take myself off."
<br> 
<br> Tom Pynsent bowed, and turned towards Lady Wetheral, whose lips were white and compressed.
<br> 
<br> "I must not take a lady's word for her daughter in future, but you did all you could to give me hope, for which I am obliged to you, Lady Wetheral. Good morning to you."
<br> 
<br> He passed Julia in silence, but she held out her hand.
<br> 
<br> "Say we are friends, Mr. Pynsent."
<br> 
<br> This little circumstance apparently overpowered poor Tom Pynsent, for he made no reply. He held the offered hand to his lips for some time, and, relinquishing it gently, he quitted the room like a man who had suffered disappointment, but who was prepared to bear his trial without flinching. Even Julia felt admiration at her lover's manly exit.
<br> 
<br> Lady Wetheral was some minutes before she spoke, though her lips had moved without [88] the power of conveying sounds. She was stupified at the conversation which had taken place before her, and Tom Pynsent was gone without her having the ability of tongue or hand to detain him! Julia had unequivocally refused Tom Pynsent, Hatton, and a settlement! These things were too powerful to bear. At length she gained her voice, but it came hollow and slowly from her parched lips.
<br> 
<br> "Julia!"
<br> 
<br> "Well, mamma, what have you to say to me? Do not you think I made a quick affair of my proposal?"
<br> 
<br> "Do you know what you have done?" said her mother, in the same dreadful tone.
<br> 
<br> "To be sure, mamma, I do. I have refused great, broad-faced, but honest Tom Pynsent; but now I have something to tell you."
<br> 
<br> Lady Wetheral waved her hand.
<br> 
<br> "Do not speak to me, Julia; and never let my eyes behold you. I cannot help being your mother, but you are no longer my daughter in feeling, and I command you to remain in your own apartments for ever. [89] You have given me the bitterest sorrow a mother can experience."
<br> 
<br> Sir John quitted the room.
<br> 
<br> "You have brought me in sorrow to the grave, for I shall never outlive this disgrace!"
<br> 
<br> "Oh yes, you will, mamma: you must live to dance at my wedding."
<br> 
<br> "I detest the sound!" she exclaimed—"your wedding! You have refused the first match in the two counties, and you will be disgraced and dishonoured among the wise, while I am pitied and despised by all my friends! Send Thompson to me."
<br> 
<br> Her ladyship became hysterical, and Julia became serious.
<br> 
<br> "I tell you, mamma, you will live to dance at my wedding, if you could only keep off those hysterics. Would you have me accept two men at once? How can I take poor Tom Pynsent when I am engaged to another!"
<br> 
<br> "Engaged to another, without asking my advice! Send instantly for Thompson: I am very ill." Her ladyship rang the bell violently. "You have killed me, and disgraced my reputation, [90] Julia,—you have trifled with my kindness and affection—you have killed your mother!"
<br> 
<br> The servant appeared, and Julia summoned the redoubted Thompson, who hurried to the scene of action. She beheld her lady in her usual state of agitation, when any thing disagreeable occurred. Julia was seated calmly by her side.
<br> 
<br> Thompson applied her usual remedies, and entreated to hear what had distressed her lady's nerves. Every family affair was confided to the lady's-maid.
<br> 
<br> "Your mistress, Thompson, is discomposed at the idea of my engagement to Lord Ennismore," replied Julia. "You know mamma has fits now, upon every fresh occurrence."
<br> 
<br> Julia's words fell upon her mother's heart like the
<br> "Sweet south upon a bank of violets, Stealing and giving odour."
<br> 
<br> She raised her head, and held out her hand to Julia.
<br> 
<br> "My dear child, you have given me excessive pain most uselessly. Thompson, I am better; you always stifle me with those salts; [91] take them away. Your obstinacy in refusing Mr. Pynsent and Hatton almost broke my heart. How could I be aware that you had secured Lord Ennismore, Julia? I never saw the least attention on his part, and I had arranged he was to propose hereafter to Clara. Well, I am much relieved. I really fancied you engaged to some horrid creature, like Leslie."
<br> 
<br> "If you had listened to me, mamma, when I told you I had something to say, all this would have been spared."
<br> 
<br> "My dear, how can people listen when they are in terror? I saw you parading before me as the wife of some common creature, and all my friends laughing at me—what horrid visions!—but now you will be a peeress, with the glory of having refused the first commoner in the county! My dear Julia, you have done extremely well; I am sorry Anna Maria has effected nothing; but I never saw Lord Ennismore offer you any attention—how did it all come about?"
<br> 
<br> "You are the only blind person, then, mamma, for Lord Ennismore has been publicly [92] attentive ever since he came to Wetheral. You must have noticed his manner last night."
<br> 
<br> "No, my dear, that was Tom Pynsent."
<br> 
<br> "Nonsense, mamma, it was Lord Ennismore. Every body saw his attentions; so would you, if you had not been running your head against Tom Pynsent. Lord Ennismore has written this morning to his mother to join him. He hopes she will be with us in a very few days. I told him not to say a word to papa yet, because I knew he objected to Lord Ennismore's health, but we shall soon nurse him into good care."
<br> 
<br> "To be sure, my love!" responded her mother, "Lord Ennismore will find himself a very different person when he is settled into married life, with a wife to watch over him. Tom Pynsent is an excellent creature, but, as you say, he is broad set, and red-faced. Too much health is worse than too little, in my opinion; Sir John will see things in a different light, when he knows of the actual proposal."
<br> 
<br> "He must be made acquainted with my [93] engagement, sooner or later," observed Julia, musing; "I wish the whole business was over."
<br> 
<br> "Let me open the business to your father, my love, and I shall be surprised if he is not extremely pleased at your good fortune. We will say nothing about it to-day, but to-morrow I will answer for his acquiescence. Lady Ennismore will find every thing arranged when she arrives, and I flatter myself you will be in Staffordshire this day six months, I shall be very proud of my daughter Ennismore!"
<br> 
<br> Julia assented to her mother's proposition, and nothing was made public till the following morning, when her ladyship found herself alone with her husband, in his study. Sir John opened the conversation, by lecturing his lady upon her sentiments.
<br> 
<br> "I am called upon, Gertrude, to object to many things which take place at Wetheral, but I was particularly hurt at your observations to Julia yesterday. Had my daughter been condemned by the laws of her country for crimes offensive to humanity, you could [94] not have expressed yourself in stronger terms than the reproaches you levelled at Julia for declining a man who was disagreeable to her."
<br> 
<br> "Now, love, that is past and gone. I was very angry with her, and should continue to be so, had I not found her refusal of Pynsent proceeded from an excellent cause, which I am going to explain. You know it is very wrong to accept one man, when you are engaged to another. That is a rule with all proper people."
<br> 
<br> "Julia has accepted some gentleman, then, Gertrude."
<br> 
<br> "Ah, how differently you and I feel under such a knowledge! A mother feels so keenly! I was obliged to send for Thompson, when I heard Julia plead an engagement. I was sure it was Leslie, or some such creature, and I was in hysterics, while you have not even changed countenance in your suspense. My love, Julia is engaged to Ennismore, if you do not object, which I am sure you will not think of doing. I congratulate you, my dear, on acquiring a peer for your son-in-law."
<br> 
<br> [95]
<br> 
<br> "And Julia refused Pynsent for Ennismore?"
<br> 
<br> "To be sure she did, most wisely."
<br> 
<br> "Then," he exclaimed, "she has done that which she will repent to her dying day; and you, Gertrude, must be responsible for her misery."
<br> 
<br> "Good heavens, how you have thrown down all my plans, Sir John, and how you embitter my happy moments! I cannot imagine why you like to terrify me in this way!"
<br> 
<br> Lady Wetheral trembled, which was ever a prelude to hysterics, but her husband's temper was now tried "to the top of its bent," and he heeded not the increasing symptoms.
<br> 
<br> "Lord Ennismore has been duped into making Julia an offer."
<br> 
<br> "I meant him for Clara, love, not Julia," cried his lady, hoping to ward off his reproach.
<br> 
<br> "And you have given one of your daughters, Gertrude, to a creature diseased in body and mind."
<br> 
<br> "What does that signify, my love? Julia will not think of his looks a month after her [96] marriage, and she will be a peeress, with an immense estate."
<br> 
<br> "You are marrying her to an idiot of quality."
<br> 
<br> "Fiddlededee, Sir John, he enters a room as well as other people. Who makes a fuss about intellects, if a man of large fortune proposes to their daughter? I should die with shame if you advanced such musty notions before company. Besides, you asked Lord Ennismore to Wetheral yourself."
<br> 
<br> "I did so," replied Sir John, "I did so; but I believed my daughters must be safe in their affections. I could not suppose Lord Ennismore would attract a woman's love; and I will not believe Julia cares for him. You have tutored her, Gertrude, to barter her soul for a coronet, and your system has corrupted her heart and feelings."
<br> 
<br> He paced the room in unusual agitation of manner. Lady Wetheral perceived the tide of her powerful influence over her husband's mind was fast ebbing, and a coup de main was the last resource of her inventive genius. She became indignant.
<br> 
<br> [97]
<br> 
<br> "It is well, Sir John, my children have possessed a mother devoted to their interest, since you have ever been indifferent to their well-doing. Had I sat supinely in my room, as you have done in your study, my daughters had passed the prime of their days in insignificance; or, if one had changed the scene, it might have been her happy lot, perhaps, to move into dirty barracks with young Leslie, whom you persist in receiving at Wetheral, in spite of my remonstrances."
<br> 
<br> "Leslie would not choose a wife from your group, my love. His idea of matrimonial comforts does not jump with your own."
<br> 
<br> "Don't make me ill, Sir John, with any allusion to that young man; or imagine for a moment we could 'jump' in any sentiment together. Had I sat supinely looking on, as you have done, Isabel would never have married a wealthy commoner, or Julia become a peeress, with the glory of refusing Tom Pynsent."
<br> 
<br> "Julia has done wrong in declining him for Ennismore; she has given up an honest fellow, [98] for a poor, ill-nursed, unhealthy creature, with a mind as weak as his body."
<br> 
<br> "I never can talk with you, Sir John, upon this kind of subject, your notions are so extremely contracted, and you are so blind to advantages."
<br> 
<br> "What advantages, Gertrude, in Ennismore?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh, my love, unspeakable advantages. He is a man of rank and large fortune, two very considerable advantages, and, if his health is not very good, it may improve; and, as to his mind, he may not be extremely learned—few men are, who are not destined for professions. He may not be particularly good-tempered, but——," Lady Wetheral became somewhat confused in her palliatives, by her husband suddenly stopping short in his perambulation, and, fixing his eyes upon her, "every body has something to balance their virtues."
<br> 
<br> "What virtues does Ennismore possess, Gertrude?"
<br> 
<br> "I'm sure I don't know; I wish you would not annoy me with such out of the way questions. [99] Lord Ennismore shows good taste in addressing Julia, and I dare say she will improve many of his foibles. Lady Ennismore will be here next week, and I hope every thing will be arranged in a few weeks, for you could not be so reckless as to withhold your consent—could you now, my love!"
<br> 
<br> "I will see Julia alone," replied Sir John.
<br> 
<br> "By all means, but do not invent objections for her, and do not distress her with your long lectures, my dear love, for my sake. I see poor Julia is very much attached."
<br> 
<br> "Nonsense! attached to such a man in a fortnight's acquaintance—for shame!"
<br> 
<br> "Julia is decidedly attached to Ennismore, Sir John, quite as much attached as a woman ought to be. I think it highly indelicate in a young girl to run after a man, and disgust him with fondness; those things are not done. She is attached very properly, and I beg you will not persuade her to the contrary."
<br> 
<br> "I shall see, Gertrude."
<br> 
<br> "You never saw in your life, my love; I never could persuade you to see any thing in a proper light."
<br> 
<br> [100]
<br> 
<br> "I saw through Boscawen, Gertrude, when you were blind."
<br> 
<br> "Nonsense! who cared to see through old Boscawen! I never thought about Isabel, therefore, her admirers could not interest me. I was sure she would only attract odd people, and you see I was correct."
