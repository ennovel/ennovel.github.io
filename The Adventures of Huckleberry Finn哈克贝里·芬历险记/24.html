Jim he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope. You see, when we left him all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all by himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he was a runaway nigger, you know. So the duke said it WAS kind of hard to have to lay roped all day, and he'd cipher out some way to get around it. </p> 
<p>He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it. He dressed Jim up in King Lear's outfit -- it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint and painted Jim's face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead, dull, solid blue, like a man that's been drownded nine days. Blamed if he warn't the horriblest looking outrage I ever see. Then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so: </p> 
<p>Sick Arab -- but harmless when not out of his head. </p> 
<p>And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five foot in front of the wigwam. Jim was satisfied. He said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all over every time there was a sound. The duke told him to make himself free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone. Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he wouldn't wait for him to howl. Why, he didn't only look like he was dead, he looked considerable more than that. </p> 
<p>These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was so much money in it, but they judged it wouldn't be safe, because maybe the news might a worked along down by this time. They couldn't hit no project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he'd lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn't put up something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop over to t'other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence to lead him the profitable way -- meaning the devil, I reckon. We had all bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his'n on, and he told me to put mine on. I done it, of course. The king's duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy. I never knowed how clothes could change a body before. Why, before, he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he'd take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand and good and pious that you'd say he had walked right out of the ark, and maybe was old Leviticus himself. Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I got my paddle ready. There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point, about three mile above the town -- been there a couple of hours, taking on freight. Says the king: </p> 
<p>"Seein' how I'm dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St. Louis or Cincinnati, or some other big place. Go for the steamboat, Huckleberry; we'll come down to the village on her." </p> 
<p>I didn't have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride. I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water. Pretty soon we come to a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had a couple of big carpet-bags by him. </p> 
<p>"Run her nose in shore," says the king. I done it. "Wher' you bound for, young man?" </p> 
<p>"For the steamboat; going to Orleans." </p> 
<p>"Git aboard," says the king. "Hold on a minute, my servant 'll he'p you with them bags. Jump out and he'p the gentleman, Adolphus" -- meaning me, I see. </p> 
<p>I done so, and then we all three started on again. The young chap was mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather. He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he'd come down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there. The young fellow says: </p> 
<p>"When I first see you I says to myself, 'It's Mr. Wilks, sure, and he come mighty near getting here in time.' But then I says again, 'No, I reckon it ain't him, or else he wouldn't be paddling up the river.' You AIN'T him, are you?" </p> 
<p>"No, my name's Blodgett -- Elexander Blodgett -- REVEREND Elexander Blodgett, I s'pose I must say, as I'm one o' the Lord's poor servants. But still I'm jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving in time, all the same, if he's missed anything by it -- which I hope he hasn't." </p> 
<p>"Well, he don't miss any property by it, because he'll get that all right; but he's missed seeing his brother Peter die -- which he mayn't mind, nobody can tell as to that -- but his brother would a give anything in this world to see HIM before he died; never talked about nothing else all these three weeks; hadn't seen him since they was boys together -- and hadn't ever seen his brother William at all -- that's the deef and dumb one -- William ain't more than thirty or thirty-five. Peter and George were the only ones that come out here; George was the married brother; him and his wife both died last year. Harvey and William's the only ones that's left now; and, as I was saying, they haven't got here in time." </p> 
<p>"Did anybody send 'em word?" </p> 
<p>"Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter said then that he sorter felt like he warn't going to get well this time. You see, he was pretty old, and George's g'yirls was too young to be much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and so he was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn't seem to care much to live. He most desperately wanted to see Harvey -- and William, too, for that matter -- because he was one of them kind that can't bear to make a will. He left a letter behind for Harvey, and said he'd told in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so George's g'yirls would be all right -- for George didn't leave nothing. And that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to." </p> 
<p>"Why do you reckon Harvey don't come? Wher' does he live?" </p> 
<p>"Oh, he lives in England -- Sheffield -- preaches there -- hasn't ever been in this country. He hasn't had any too much time -- and besides he mightn't a got the letter at all, you know." </p> 
<p>"Too bad, too bad he couldn't a lived to see his brothers, poor soul. You going to Orleans, you say?" </p> 
<p>"Yes, but that ain't only a part of it. I'm going in a ship, next Wednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives." </p> 
<p>"It's a pretty long journey. But it'll be lovely; wisht I was a-going. Is Mary Jane the oldest? How old is the others?" </p> 
<p>"Mary Jane's nineteen, Susan's fifteen, and Joanna's about fourteen -- that's the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare-lip." </p> 
<p>"Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so." </p> 
<p>"Well, they could be worse off. Old Peter had friends, and they ain't going to let them come to no harm. There's Hobson, the Babtis' preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley, and -- well, there's a lot of them; but these are the ones that Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes, when he wrote home; so Harvey 'll know where to look for friends when he gets here." </p> 
<p>Well, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied that young fellow. Blamed if he didn't inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about Peter's business -- which was a tanner; and about George's -- which was a carpenter; and about Harvey's -- which was a dissentering minister; and so on, and so on. Then he says: </p> 
<p>"What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?" </p> 
<p>"Because she's a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn't stop there. When they're deep they won't stop for a hail. A Cincinnati boat will, but this is a St. Louis one." </p> 
<p>"Was Peter Wilks well off?" </p> 
<p>"Oh, yes, pretty well off. He had houses and land, and it's reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up som'ers." </p> 
<p>"When did you say he died?" </p> 
<p>"I didn't say, but it was last night." </p> 
<p>"Funeral to-morrow, likely?" </p> 
<p>"Yes, 'bout the middle of the day." </p> 
<p>"Well, it's all terrible sad; but we've all got to go, one time or another. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we're all right." </p> 
<p>"Yes, sir, it's the best way. Ma used to always say that." </p> 
<p>When we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon she got off. The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost my ride, after all. When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up another mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says: </p> 
<p>"Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new carpet-bags. And if he's gone over to t'other side, go over there and git him. And tell him to git himself up regardless. Shove along, now." </p> 
<p>I see what HE was up to; but I never said nothing, of course. When I got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on a log, and the king told him everything, just like the young fellow had said it -- every last word of it. And all the time he was a-doing it he tried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, for a slouch. I can't imitate him, and so I ain't a-going to try to; but he really done it pretty good. Then he says: </p> 
<p>"How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?" </p> 
<p>The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef and dumb person on the histronic boards. So then they waited for a steamboat. </p> 
<p>About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along, but they didn't come from high enough up the river; but at last there was a big one, and they hailed her. She sent out her yawl, and we went aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, and said they wouldn't land us. But the king was ca'm. He says: </p> 
<p>"If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry 'em, can't it?" </p> 
<p>So they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to the village they yawled us ashore. About two dozen men flocked down when they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says: </p> 
<p>"Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher' Mr. Peter Wilks lives?" they give a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to say, "What d' I tell you?" Then one of them says, kind of soft and gentle: </p> 
<p>"I'm sorry. sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he DID live yesterday evening." </p> 
<p>Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and fell up against the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his back, and says: </p> 
<p>"Alas, alas, our poor brother -- gone, and we never got to see him; oh, it's too, too hard!" </p> 
<p>Then he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn't drop a carpet-bag and bust out a-crying. If they warn't the beatenest lot, them two frauds, that ever I struck. </p> 
<p>Well, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said all sorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the hill for them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king all about his brother's last moments, and the king he told it all over again on his hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that dead tanner like they'd lost the twelve disciples. Well, if ever I struck anything like it, I'm a nigger. It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human race. </p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 他又将那块牌子钉在木条上，把木条竖在窝棚前边四五英尺远的地方。吉姆满意了。他说这样好多了，不必像原来那样捆着躺一天总觉得象是好几年，每回有一点声响都浑身直哆嗦。公爵告诉他轻轻松松，放心大胆，要是有人过去找事儿，他肯定得从窝棚里蹦出来，发作一阵，跟头野兽那样嚎上一两声，他猜想找事儿的人就会赶紧走开，不再管他。这话听起来好象很有道理，可是，你拿一般人来说吧，他不会等着他嚎的，为什么？他可不仅仅是看着像个死人，他那个样子比死人还可怕。这两个坏蛋还想再试试皇室奇物，因为那可以赚好多钱，不过他们又觉得不妥当，因为没准消息到这会儿已经沿路传过来了。他们一时想不出合适的方案。最后公爵说，他得躺一两个小时动动脑筋，看能否想出什么办法，在这个阿肯色的村庄上捞它一把。国王说他要顺便到另一个村上去，什么计划也不想，而是听天由命，按照上帝指引他走上发财之路--我看是靠魔鬼来帮忙。</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 在上次靠岸的地方，我们全买了新衣服。这会儿，国王换上了他的新衣，他叫我把我的新衣服也穿上。我当然就穿上了。国王的衣服都是黑色的，他穿着的确十分神气，很有派头。以前我可不知道人靠衣服还真长精神。过去，他那样子看上去像个腻歪的老无赖；可在眼下，当他摘掉崭新的白色海狸皮帽，弯腰鞠躬面带微笑时，他的神情那么庄重，和善而又虔诚，你会觉得他刚刚步出方舟，没准他就是挪亚老先生本人呢。吉姆打扫干净了独木舟，我准备好桨。一条大轮船靠在岸边，离那个码头下面很远，大约在村子上面三英里地--停在那儿几个小时了，正在装货。国王道："看我这身穿戴，我想也许我最好说是从圣路易斯或辛辛那提或其他大地方来的。朝轮船那儿划，哈克贝利；我们要坐着它到下面那个村。"我一点儿也不用他咐咐第二遍，当然想去坐一把大轮船了。我划到村子上边半英里地靠近了河岸，然后沿着陡峭的堤岸在静水里快速地向前划。很快，我们遇上一个长相好看、老实单纯的乡下小伙子，他正坐在一根木头上擦脸上的汗，由于天气特别热，他身旁还放着两个大旅行包。</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "调头往岸上划，"国王说。我照办。"　你要往哪儿去呀，年轻人？""上那条轮船，去奥尔良。""上这上面来吧，"国王说，"　等一下，我的仆人会替你提那两个大包。跳下去帮帮那位先生，阿道弗斯。"　--这是在说我，我明白。</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 我跳下去帮他提包，然后，我们三人又往前划。那年轻人很感谢我们，他说这种天气提着包赶路可真累人。他问国王要上哪儿，国王告诉他说自己打大河上游来，今天早上在另一个村子上了岸，现在他要往上游走几英里，去看那边农场上的一个老朋友。那个年轻人说："我第一眼看到你的时候，心想：'这是威尔克斯先生，没错儿，他来得几乎正是时候。'可是我又说，'不对，我看这不是他，否则，他得顺着水向下游走才对！你（不是）他吧，是不是？'""不是，我叫布洛吉特--亚历山大·布洛吉特--牧师亚历山大·布洛吉特，我想我得说明，我是上帝的仆人。只是我还是替威尔克斯先生未能及时赶到而难过，的的确确，要是他因为晚来错过了什么--（我）希望他没错过。""啊，他不会因为这错过什么财产，因为他一样会拿到手，可他错过了见他兄弟最后一面的机会--这个他或许也不在乎，谁都说不明白这种事--不过他兄弟可是想在临终前见他一面，即使把他所有的东西都送人也愿意，这三个星期他什么也不说，总在念叨他；他们从小时候分手后一直都不曾见过面--也没有见过他兄弟威廉--就那个又聋又哑的小兄弟--威廉仅仅30　或35　岁。只有彼得和乔治来这儿；乔治是结了婚的那个兄弟，他和他老婆去年全死了。现在只剩下哈维和威廉兄弟俩，我刚才讲过，他们还没来得及赶来这儿。""有人给他们去过信吗？""噢，有啊，一两个月之前，在彼得刚病倒的时候，因为彼得当时说他感觉这回他的病不会好了。你知道，他年岁大了，乔治的女儿又太小，不能常陪他，只有那个红头发的玛丽·简还行，所以，在乔治和他老婆死后，他就有些孤单，好像不怎么想活下去。他想得要命想见哈维，当然还有威廉，为那件事--因为他是那种一想起来不立遗嘱就受不了的人。他给哈维留下一封信，信里说了他的钱藏到了什么地方，还有他预备怎样分割遗产，这样，乔治的几个女儿都可以妥善安顿--因为乔治死后没有留下什么东西，那封信就是他们勉勉强强劝他动笔写成的唯一的一份东西。""你怎么会猜到哈维没来呢？他住在哪里？""噢，他住在英国设菲尔德，在那里传教，没来过这个国家。他不怎么有空，再说他或许根本就没有收到那封信，你知道。""太可怜了，他不能和他兄弟们见上最后一面真是太不幸了，可怜的灵魂。你要去奥尔良？""对，不过这仅仅是一截路。下个星期三，我就会坐船去里约热内卢，我叔叔住在那里。""好远的路啊。不过，那会很有意思的，我都想去。玛丽·简年龄多大？其他几个多大啦！"　"玛丽·简19　岁，苏珊15，乔安娜差不多14--她的话很多，是个豁嘴儿。""可怜的孩子！孤单单地被留在这个冰冷的世界上。""嗨，她们还不算倒霉。老彼得有朋友，他们不会让她们几个受什么伤害。他的朋友有霍布森，他是浸礼会牧师；还有洛特·哈维执事，还有本·罗克，阿布纳·沙克尔福特，还有莱维·贝尔律师，罗宾逊医生，另外还有他们的太太，还有巴特莱寡妇，还有--反正有很多。只是这些人是彼得交情最深的几位，他给老家写信时，常提到他们，因此哈维到这儿以后会知道去哪儿找朋友。"嘿，那老家伙不住地提问题，直到把那个年轻小伙子肚里知道的那些事儿全都掏出来。他如果没把那个倒霉村子里的每个人每件事，还有威尔克斯的全部情况都问个底朝天，那才叫怪呢！他还问彼得干的行当，他是个皮革匠，还有乔治，他是个木匠；还问了哈维，他是个新教徒派的牧师，诸如此类等等。后来他问："你干嘛要往上走这么远，去搭那条轮船呢？""因为那是去奥尔良的大船，我原本还怕他不在那里停靠呢。这种船在深水的时候，你喊它也不停。辛辛那提的船就停，不过这条船是圣路易斯的。""彼得·威尔克斯家境如何？""啊，非常好。他有房有地，人们猜测他会留下三四千块现钱，不知会藏在哪儿。""你说他啥时候死的？""我没说，只是，他是昨晚上死的。""葬礼明--天办吧，是不是？""对，可能是明天中午。""唉，这太让人难过了，不过我们都会要死的，这是迟早的事儿。所以我们该做的是有个准备；这样就可以啦。""是这话，先生，这样是最好啦。妈从前总说这种话。"我们划到那条船跟前时，它已经快装完货了，过了一阵，它开走了。国王根本不提上船的事儿，我也最终没坐成大轮船。那条船开走之后，国王叫我再向上游划一英里地，找了块偏僻的地方，他上了岸，对我说："现在立刻划回去，把公爵接过来，还有新旅行包。要是他去了河对岸，过去找到他。告诉他不管怎样都要来。快划吧。"我明白他这是要搞什么名堂，不过我当然一句话也不问。当我载着公爵过来时，我们藏好独木舟，接着，他们在一根木头上坐下，国王把情况原原本本地跟他讲了一遍，和那个小伙子说的一样--一字不差。他讲的时候，始终尽力装得像个英国人在说话，对于他这么个笨蛋来说，装得很不错。我模仿不了他，因此我也不打算学，不过他的确做得相当好。后来他说："你去装扮那个聋子哑巴好不好，比尔奇沃特？"公爵说，让他去扮放心好了；他说他在舞台上演过聋子哑巴。这样，他们就单等着轮船过来。</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 大约是下午半晌的时候，两只小船过来了，可是，它们可不是从河上游很远过来的，不过，一条大船终于开了过来，他们就招呼它。大船放出小艇，我们得以上了船，这条船是打辛辛那提开来的。他们一听我们就坐四五英里，气得发蒙，把我们大骂一通，还说到时候不给我们靠岸。不过国王很沉得住气。他说："如果先生们出得起钱，一英里地一块，让小艇子接上送下，一条轮船载他们也划算吧，对不对？"这样一说，他们口气就软了下来，连声说这好办；当我们到了那个村子旁，他们又拿小艇把我们送上岸。大约有24　个人看到小艇过去，就一齐往河边跑，这时候，国王说："你们哪位先生能告诉我彼得·威尔克斯先生住在什么地方吗？"他们互相瞥一眼，点点头，好像在说："　我怎么跟你说的？"接着，一个人开口了，说话又和气又斯文："对不起，先生，不过我们至多只能告诉您昨天晚上他曾经住过的地方。"一转眼的工夫，那个混蛋的老家伙顿时垮了下来，倒在那人的身上，下巴搁到人家肩膀上，哭得连腰都直不起来，还一面说："哎呀，哎呀！我们可怜的兄弟去啦，我们可是再也看不到他啦，啊，这可太，（太）难过啦！"然后，他转过身，一边抽抽泣泣，冲着公爵做了很多愚蠢至极的手势，结果，那家伙扔掉一只包，猛然放声痛哭起来。他们要不是最无赖最没治的坏蛋才叫怪呢！这俩大骗子全都该死，我还真的从来没见过这号东西。</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 于是，那帮人都围上来对他俩表示同情，还说了无数好话安慰他俩，替他们拿着旅行包上了山坡，让他俩倚在他们身上哭，告诉国王他兄弟在辞世前的全部细节，国王再拿手势给公爵比划一遍，他俩装腔作势哭那个皮革匠，痛心至极。唉，我要是见过一回这种事，我就不算人。这足以让人替整个人类都害臊。</p>
