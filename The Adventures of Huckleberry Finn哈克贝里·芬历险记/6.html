He catched me a couple of times and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged him or outrun him most of the time. I didn't want to go to school much before, but I reckoned I'd go now to spite pap. That law trial was a slow business -- appeared like they warn't ever going to get started on it; so every now and then I'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. Every time he got money he got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and every time he raised Cain he got jailed. He was just suited -- this kind of thing was right in his line. </p> 
<p>He got to hanging around the widow's too much and so she told him at last that if he didn't quit using around there she would make trouble for him. Well, WASN'T he mad? He said he would show who was Huck Finn's boss. So he watched out for me one day in the spring, and catched me, and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff, and crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn't no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you couldn't find it if you didn't know where it was. </p> 
<p>He kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off. We lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the key under his head nights. He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon, and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on. Every little while he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time, and licked me. The widow she found out where I was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn't long after that till I was used to being where I was, and liked it -- all but the cowhide part. </p> 
<p>It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking and fishing, and no books nor study. Two months or more run along, and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn't see how I'd ever got to like it so well at the widow's, where you had to wash, and eat on a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be forever bothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the time. I didn't want to go back no more. I had stopped cussing, because the widow didn't like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn't no objections. It was pretty good times up in the woods there, take it all around. </p> 
<p>But by and by pap got too handy with his hick'ry, and I couldn't stand it. I was all over welts. He got to going away so much, too, and locking me in. Once he locked me in and was gone three days. It was dreadful lonesome. I judged he had got drowned, and I wasn't ever going to get out any more. I was scared. I made up my mind I would fix up some way to leave there. I had tried to get out of that cabin many a time, but I couldn't find no way. There warn't a window to it big enough for a dog to get through. I couldn't get up the chimbly; it was too narrow. The door was thick, solid oak slabs. Pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away; I reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in the time. But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work. There was an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out. I got under the table and raised the blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out -- big enough to let me through. Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap's gun in the woods. I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty soon pap come in. </p> 
<p>Pap warn't in a good humor -- so he was his natural self. He said he was down town, and everything was going wrong. His lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it And he said people allowed there'd be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would win this time. This shook me up considerable, because I didn't want to go back to the widow's any more and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it. Then the old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of, and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn't skipped any, and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round, including a considerable parcel of people which he didn't know the names of, and so called them what's-his-name when he got to them, and went right along with his cussing. </p> 
<p>He said he would like to see the widow get me. He said he would watch out, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they dropped and they couldn't find me. That made me pretty uneasy again, but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn't stay on hand till he got that chance. </p> 
<p>The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got. There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon, ammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two newspapers for wadding, besides some tow. I toted up a load, and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest. I thought it all over, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and take to the woods when I run away. I guessed I wouldn't stay in one place, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and hunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow couldn't ever find me any more. I judged I would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would. I got so full of it I didn't notice how long I was staying till the old man hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded. </p> 
<p>I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark. While I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up, and went to ripping again. He had been drunk over in town, and laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at. A body would a thought he was Adam -- he was just all mud. Whenever his liquor begun to work he most always went for the govment. his time he says: </p> 
<p>"Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it's like. Here's the law a-standing ready to take a man's son away from him -- a man's own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising. Yes, just as that man has got that son raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin' for HIM and give him a rest, the law up and goes for him. And they call THAT govment! That ain't all, nuther. The law backs that old Judge Thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o' my property. Here's what the law does: The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and up'ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets him go round in clothes that ain't fitten for a hog. They call that govment! A man can't get his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes I've a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes, and I TOLD 'em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face. Lots of 'em heard me, and can tell what I said. Says I, for two cents I'd leave the blamed country and never come a-near it agin. Them's the very words. I says look at my hat -- if you call it a hat -- but the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it's below my chin, and then it ain't rightly a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o' stovepipe. Look at it, says I -- such a hat for me to wear -- one of the wealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights. </p> 
<p>"Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. Why, looky here. There was a free nigger there from Ohio -- a mulatter, most as white as a white man. He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the shiniest hat; and there ain't a man in that town that's got as fine clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a silver-headed cane -- the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State. And what do you think? They said he was a p'fessor in a college, and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything. And that ain't the wust. They said he could VOTE when he was at home. Well, that let me out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to? It was 'lection day, and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn't too drunk to get there; but when they told me there was a State in this country where they'd let that nigger vote, I drawed out. I says I'll never vote agin. Them's the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may rot for all me -- I'll never vote agin as long as I live. And to see the cool way of that nigger -- why, he wouldn't a give me the road if I hadn't shoved him out o' the way. I says to the people, why ain't this nigger put up at auction and sold? -- that's what I want to know. And what do you reckon they said? Why, they said he couldn't be sold till he'd been in the State six months, and he hadn't been there that long yet. There, now -- that's a specimen. They call that a govment that can't sell a free nigger till he's been in the State six months. Here's a govment that calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a govment, and yet's got to set stock-still for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free nigger, and --" </p> 
<p>Pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of language -- mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give the tub some, too, all along, here and there. He hopped around the cabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding first one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick. But it warn't good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that fairly made a body's hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and rolled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had ever done previous. He said so his own self afterwards. He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laid over him, too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe. </p> 
<p>After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens. That was always his word. I judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal the key, or saw myself out, one or t'other. He drank and drank, and tumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn't run my way. He didn't go sound asleep, but was uneasy. He groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time. At last I got so sleepy I couldn't keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I knowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning. </p> 
<p>I don't know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an awful scream and I was up. There was pap looking wild, and skipping around every which way and yelling about snakes. He said they was crawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say one had bit him on the cheek -- but I couldn't see no snakes. He started and run round and round the cabin, hollering "Take him off! take him off! he's biting me on the neck!" I never see a man look so wild in the eyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he rolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way, and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and saying there was devils a-hold of him. He wore out by and by, and laid still a while, moaning. Then he laid stiller, and didn't make a sound. I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it seemed terrible still. He was laying over by the corner. By and by he raised up part way and listened, with his head to one side. He says, very low: </p> 
<p>"Tramp -- tramp -- tramp; that's the dead; tramp -- tramp -- tramp; they're coming after me; but I won't go. Oh, they're here! don't touch me -- don't! hands off -- they're cold; let go. Oh, let a poor devil alone!" </p> 
<p>Then he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying. I could hear him through the blanket. </p> 
<p>By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he see me and went for me. He chased me round and round the place with a claspknife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me, and then I couldn't come for him no more. I begged, and told him I was only Huck; but he laughed SUCH a screechy laugh, and roared and cussed, and kept on chasing me up. Once when I turned short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick as lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and dropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a minute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he would sleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who. </p>  
<p>　　他在寡妇家四周转悠的次数太多了，因此，寡妇后来告诉他，要是他还在那儿转悠，她就对他不客气。好家伙，这不会把他气疯吗？他说他要看看哈克·芬到底归谁管。于是，那年春天有一次，他盯上我，把我抓住了，把我带到大河上游三英里远的地方，坐小船过了河，划到了伊利诺斯州的岸边，那地方树多，又没有房子，只有一个破旧的小木屋，周围树林茂密，要是不知道小屋的位置，谁也不会找到。</p> 
<p>　　他让我一直跟着他，我没有任何机会逃走。我们住在那个破旧小屋里，夜里，他总会锁上门，把钥匙压在他头底下。他有一杆枪，我猜多半是偷来的，我们钓鱼打猎，就这么过日子。不久，他把我锁在屋里，自己到下面商店里去，离码头大约有三英里地，用鱼和猎物换威士忌，回家来喝个烂醉，痛快一阵，再打我一顿。寡妇后来打听到我的地方，还派人过来想找到我，可是，爸用枪把那个人赶走了。那件事过后不久，我就习惯了那个地方，也乐意在那儿呆了，什么都好，除了挨鞭子之外。日子过得懒洋洋的，很惬意，整天舒舒服服地躺着，抽抽烟，钓钓鱼，没书，也不学习。两个多月一晃眼就过去了，我的衣服弄得又烂又脏，我不明白当初在寡妇家我怎么会喜欢上那种日子，你得天天洗脸，吃饭用盘子，还得梳头，按时睡觉起床，又要为书本大费脑筋，老华森小姐还不断地挑毛病找茬。我再也不想回家了。我早就不骂人了，因为寡妇不喜欢；可是现在，我又习惯骂人了，因为爸不反对。总之，在树林里日子过得挺好。</p> 
<p>　　可到后来，爸那条山核桃木鞭用得过于顺手了，我就受不了啦。我浑身鞭痕。他出门也勤了，老把我锁在屋子里。有一次，他锁住我出去了三天，我憋闷得要死。我估计他是淹死了，那我就别指望着出去了。我害怕。我下定决心要想办法离开。我好几次试着要逃出去，都没一点进展。小屋连个狗能钻过去的窗户也没有，我又不能人烟囱朝外爬，太窄了。门是又厚又结实的橡木板。爸很小心，他走的时候从不把刀子之类的东西留在小屋里，我觉得我把那地方都翻过无数次了，我总是在找东西，毕竟这是打发时间的唯一办法。但是这一次，我终于找到点东西，我找了一把生锈的旧木锯，没把手，它放在椽子和屋顶的护墙板之间。我给它上了油就动手干了起来。一块旧马毯钉在屋子那头桌子后面的圆木上，怕风从墙缝里刮进来吹灭蜡烛。我钻到桌子下，掀开马毯就开始了，得把下面那根圆木锯掉一截儿，大得够我钻出去。这活着实叫我干了好长时间，我快干完的时候，听到了爸在树林里放枪。我清除掉自己干活的痕迹，垂下毯子，藏好木锯，不一阵，爸进来了。</p> 
<p>　　爸心情不好，因此就原形毕露。他说他去了趟镇上，事情都错了。他的律师说，他认为他能赢这场官司拿到钱，只要他们能开庭受理，可他们总有办法拖延好长时间不开庭，萨切尔法官就知道该怎么办。他又说大家认为会再立一案，判我跟他断绝关系，让寡妇做我的监护人，他们猜这回肯定能赢。这可叫我大吃一惊，因为我不想再回到寡妇家，去受拘束被教化，就跟他们说的那样。接着，老头儿开始骂人，他把能想到的人都骂到了，后来，又挨个儿骂一遍，唯恐漏掉谁，再以后又把大家放一起统统骂了才算完，包括好多他连名字都叫不出来的人，轮到这些人时，他就说"那个叫什么的"，这么一直骂下去。</p> 
<p>　　他说他很想瞧瞧寡妇怎样把我夺走。他说他要提防着，要是他们想跟他耍花招，他知道离这里六七英里有个地方，把我藏到那里，谁也找不到，那时候他们只得作罢。我听了又不舒服起来，可是仅仅过了一两分钟，我想我决不会呆在他身边让他有那机会。</p> 
<p>　　老头儿叫我到小船上，把他弄到的东西取回来。那儿有一袋50 磅的玉米面，一块咸猪肉，还有弹药，四加仑（加伦：(美国液量单位)3 1 785 升。）威士忌，以及垫东西用的旧书和两张报纸，还有点儿短麻丝。我运了一趟，回来在船头坐下歇歇。我把事情从头到尾盘算了一遍，要逃的话，就带上枪和几条鱼线去树林。我想不会呆在一个地方，而是到全国各处游荡，大部分是在晚上走，靠打猎钓鱼活命，走得远远的，这么一来，老头儿跟寡妇就谁也找不到我了。我估计那天晚上假如爸醉糊涂的话，我就能把它锯开，我猜他会那样。我光想着这件事，没想到我歇的时间太长了，以至于到后来，老头儿扯着嗓子问我是睡着了，还是淹死了。</p> 
<p>　　我把东西全搬进小屋里，天都快黑了。我做饭的时候，老头儿痛饮了一阵儿，劲头上来了又破口大骂一通。他在镇上本来就喝醉了，在臭水沟里躺了一夜，那样子可真够瞧的。人们还以为他是泥做的亚当呢，一身泥巴。他酒劲儿发作时，几乎总是骂政府。这一回，他说："这也叫政府！嘿，瞧瞧吧，看它像个什么东西。还有法律，专门等着把人家的儿子抢走--他的亲生儿子，他费尽千辛万苦，整天操心挂念，花了无数的钱，才把儿子养大，就是么，总算等到把儿子养大了，想让儿子干点儿事，孝顺孝顺他，叫他喘口气歇歇，法律就跑过来找他的麻烦。他们竟把那东西称做政府！法律替萨切尔法官那老家伙撑腰，帮着他抢走我自己的财产。这就是法律干的好事。法律抓着一个有六千多块钱的人，把他硬塞到这么个破旧笼子一般的小屋里，让他穿着猪都不要的烂衣服四处丢人现眼。他们叫它政府！一个人在这样的政府下享受不到他的权利。有时候，我就想干脆离开这个国家算了，永远也不回来了。是的，我跟他们说过这话；我当着萨切尔那老家伙的面就这么说的，很多人都听见了，都能证明我的话。我说，给我两分钱我就离开这个混蛋国家，再不沾它的边儿了。就这话。我还说，瞧瞧我的帽子--要是你们把它也能叫帽子的话--帽顶翘着，帽檐儿都耷拉到我下巴底下去了，这根本就不能算是帽子，倒更像是我的头被硬塞到一截火炉烟筒里去了。瞧瞧，我说--这样的帽子叫我戴着--我本来应该是这镇上最有钱的一个人，当然如果我能享受我的权利的话。""啊，对了，这真是个奇妙的政府，奇妙得很。哼，瞧瞧，镇上有个自由黑人，从俄亥俄州来，是个混血儿，几乎跟白人一样白。他还穿着最白的衬衣，戴着最漂亮的帽子，全镇上没有一个人的衣服比他更好，他有个金表金链子，还有根银头手杖--差不多是全州最叫人看得起的灰白头发老富翁。你猜怎么样？他们说他是个大学教授，哪国的话他都会讲，什么他都懂。这还不算最糟呢。他们说要是在他的家乡，他也能投票选举。哈，这叫我发懵。我心想，这个国家要糟成什么样子呀？那天是选举日，我刚要去投票，如果不是醉得走不到地方我就想亲自去，可是他们对我说在这个国家，只有一个州他们准许那黑人投票，我不去了。我说我再也不投票了。我就是那么讲的，一字不差，他们都听见了。我恨不得这个国家马上完蛋，我只要活着，这辈子都不去投票了。还要看那黑人的傲慢颈儿，干嘛呀，我如果不把他使劲推开，他路也不给我让。我对那群人说，干嘛不把这黑人拿去拍卖掉？我就是想明白这个。你猜他们说什么？唉，他们说他要在这个州足够六个月才可以卖，但他还没待那么长呢。得了吧，你瞧，这简直是怪事。待不够六个月就不能把一个自由黑人卖掉，他们还管它叫政府。这儿有个政府，自己管自己叫政府，就让它接着做政府吧，让它想着自己是政府吧，可是它得纹丝不动坐上整整六个月才可以去抓一个偷偷摸摸贼头贼脑可恶该死穿着雪白衬衣的自由黑人，还."爸一气儿地骂下去，没当心他那两条老腿东倒西歪把他带到了哪儿，结果一下子撞在咸肉桶，摔了个倒栽葱，两根胫骨都碰破了，接下去，他的话可都是最不入耳的了--多半还是咒黑人和政府，尽管他也时不时地骂一两句木桶。在小屋里他换着腿来回跳，提提这根胫骨，又捏捏那一根，后来，他突然放开左脚，猛踢那个木桶。这下可没算计好，因为他左脚穿的正是那只前面露着两个脚趾头的鞋，于是，他狂嚎一声，叫得人头皮发炸，他倒在脏土里打着滚儿，捂着他的脚趾头，再往后他骂得比以往任何时候都凶。后来，他自己亲口这么说的..晚饭后，爸拿过酒罐，说里头的酒足够他醉上两回，发回酒疯儿。他总讲这些话。我估计不到一个小时，他就会醉得稀里糊涂，人事不省。然后，我就偷钥匙，或者自己锯墙逃走，怎么都行。他喝了又喝，慢慢地倒在毯子上。可是，我还是不走运，他并未睡死，只是有些难受。他呻吟叫唤，又来回甩胳膊，折腾了好久。最后，我困得睁不开眼睛，怎么也撑不住，不知不觉就睡熟了，蜡烛亮着。</p> 
<p>　　我不知睡了多久，猛地听到一声可怕的尖叫，我醒了过来。是爸，像发疯一样，左蹦右跳，嘴里还嚷嚷着有蛇。他说蛇正顺着他的脚往上爬，说话间他就跳起来，惨叫一声，又说有一条蛇咬了他的面颊--可是我看不见有什么蛇。他跳着在小屋里跑了一圈儿又一圈儿。他边跑边喊：" 抓掉它！抓掉它！它咬住我的脖子了！" 我从未见过这么疯的眼神，很快，他就累瘫在那里了，倒下来喘着气，后来，他在地上直打滚儿，滚得快极了，碰到什么踢什么，用双手朝四处又抓又打，惨叫着，说魔鬼缠住他了。不多久，他又累坏了，乖乖地躺了一会儿，嘴里还在叫唤。后来，他躺得更老实了，不吱一声。我听得见猫头鹰和狼的叫声，它们在远处的树林里，外面好像静得有些可怕。他在那边的墙角里躺着。慢慢地，他撑起来半片身子，把头歪到一边听了听。他声音低低地说："嚓--嚓--嚓，这是死人的脚步声；嚓--嚓--嚓，他们在后边追我来了。我偏不去--噢，他们来了！别碰我--别碰！手拿开..冰凉冰凉的手；放开..噢，让这个可怜的家伙自己呆会儿吧！"说完，他四肢朝地，爬着求他们放过他，他翻滚着把自己裹到毯子里，滚到了那张旧松木桌子底下，还在不住地哀求。后来，他就哭了起来。隔着毯子我也能听到他的哭声。</p> 
<p>　　不一会儿，他又滚了出来，双脚朝上跳，如同发疯一般，他看到我就朝我冲过来。他手拿一把折刀，撵得我在那地方团团转，说我是死亡天使，还说要杀了我，这样我才不会寻他的事儿。我乞求他，告诉他我只不过是哈克，但是，他笑啊笑得声音那个尖呐，连吼带骂，不停地追赶我。有一回，我转过身去，躲到他胳膊下面时，他伸手一把抓住了我的上衣后领，我想这回我完了。但是，我飞快地挣脱了上衣，救了自己。不久，他累垮了，背靠着门，说他要歇一分钟再杀我。他把刀压在身子底下，说他得睡会儿，攒把劲儿，然后再瞧瞧到底谁怕谁。这样，他很快就打起盹来。不久，我拿过那把底板开裂的椅子爬了上去，轻手轻脚地没弄出一点声响，取下了那杆枪。我拉下枪栓，看明白它确实装着弹药，然后，我把它架到了萝卜桶上，对准爸，坐在枪后边等着他动弹。时间拖拖拉拉走得好慢好轻啊。</p>
