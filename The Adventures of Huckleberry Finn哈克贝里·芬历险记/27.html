So I tiptoed along, and got down stairs all right. There warn't a sound anywheres. I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs. The door was open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was a candle in both rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was open; but I see there warn't nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so I shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn't there. Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind me. I run in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the only place I see to hide the bag was in the coffin. The lid was shoved along about a foot, showing the dead man's face down in there, with a wet cloth over it, and his shroud on. I tucked the moneybag in under the lid, just down beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me creep, they was so cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door. </p> 
<p>The person coming was Mary Jane. She went to the coffin, very soft, and kneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I see she begun to cry, though I couldn't hear her, and her back was to me. I slid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I'd make sure them watchers hadn't seen me; so I looked through the crack, and everything was all right. They hadn't stirred. </p> 
<p>I slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing playing out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much resk about it. Says I, if it could stay where it is, all right; because when we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to Mary Jane, and she could dig him up again and get it; but that ain't the thing that's going to happen; the thing that's going to happen is, the money 'll be found when they come to screw on the lid. Then the king 'll get it again, and it 'll be a long day before he gives anybody another chance to smouch it from him. Of course I WANTED to slide down and get it out of there, but I dasn't try it. Every minute it was getting earlier now, and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir, and I might get catched -- catched with six thousand dollars in my hands that nobody hadn't hired me to take care of. I don't wish to be mixed up in no such business as that, I says to myself. </p> 
<p>When I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up, and the watchers was gone. There warn't nobody around but the family and the widow Bartley and our tribe. I watched their faces to see if anything had been happening, but I couldn't tell. </p> 
<p>Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, and they set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors till the hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full. I see the coffin lid was the way it was before, but I dasn't go to look in under it, with folks around. </p> 
<p>Then the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took seats in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour the people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the dead man's face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was all very still and solemn, only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a little. There warn't no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and blowing noses -- because people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other places except church. </p> 
<p>When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last touches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable, and making no more sound than a cat. He never spoke; he moved people around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done it with nods, and signs with his hands. Then he took his place over against the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever see; and there warn't no more smile to him than there is to a ham. </p> 
<p>They had borrowed a melodeum -- a sick one; and when everything was ready a young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one that had a good thing, according to my notion. Then the Reverend Hobson opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only one dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right along; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait -- you couldn't hear yourself think. It was right down awkward, and nobody didn't seem to know what to do. But pretty soon they see that long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say, "Don't you worry -- just depend on me." Then he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people's heads. So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two sides of the room, he disappears down cellar. Then in about two seconds we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off. In a minute or two here comes this undertaker's back and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his mouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher, over the people's heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, "HE HAD A RAT!" Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place. You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people, because naturally they wanted to know. A little thing like that don't cost nothing, and it's just the little things that makes a man to be looked up to and liked. There warn't no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was. </p> 
<p>Well, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage, and at last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the coffin with his screw-driver. I was in a sweat then, and watched him pretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as soft as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast. So there I was! I didn't know whether the money was in there or not. So, says I, s'pose somebody has hogged that bag on the sly? -- now how do I know whether to write to Mary Jane or not? S'pose she dug him up and didn't find nothing, what would she think of me? Blame it, I says, I might get hunted up and jailed; I'd better lay low and keep dark, and not write at all; the thing's awful mixed now; trying to better it, I've worsened it a hundred times, and I wish to goodness I'd just let it alone, dad fetch the whole business! </p> 
<p>They buried him, and we come back home, and I went to watching faces again -- I couldn't help it, and I couldn't rest easy. But nothing come of it; the faces didn't tell me nothing. </p> 
<p>The king he visited around in the evening, and sweetened everybody up, and made himself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that his congregation over in England would be in a sweat about him, so he must hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home. He was very sorry he was so pushed, and so was everybody; they wished he could stay longer, but they said they could see it couldn't be done. And he said of course him and William would take the girls home with them; and that pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well fixed and amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too -- tickled them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; and told him to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready. Them poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them getting fooled and lied to so, but I didn't see no safe way for me to chip in and change the general tune. </p> 
<p>Well, blamed if the king didn't bill the house and the niggers and all the property for auction straight off -- sale two days after the funeral; but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to. </p> 
<p>So the next day after the funeral, along about noontime, the girls' joy got the first jolt. A couple of nigger traders come along, and the king sold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called it, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their mother down the river to Orleans. I thought them poor girls and them niggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around each other, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it. The girls said they hadn't ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the town. I can't ever get it out of my memory, the sight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other's necks and crying; and I reckon I couldn't a stood it all, but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn't knowed the sale warn't no account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two. </p> 
<p>The thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the children that way. It injured the frauds some; but the old fool he bulled right along, spite of all the duke could say or do, and I tell you the duke was powerful uneasy. </p> 
<p>Next day was auction day. About broad day in the morning the king and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up, and I see by their look that there was trouble. The king says: </p> 
<p>"Was you in my room night before last?" </p> 
<p>"No, your majesty" -- which was the way I always called him when nobody but our gang warn't around. </p> 
<p>"Was you in there yisterday er last night?" </p> 
<p>"No, your majesty." </p> 
<p>"Honor bright, now -- no lies." </p> 
<p>"Honor bright, your majesty, I'm telling you the truth. I hain't been a-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed it to you." </p> 
<p>The duke says: </p> 
<p>"Have you seen anybody else go in there?" </p> 
<p>"No, your grace, not as I remember, I believe." </p> 
<p>"Stop and think." </p> 
<p>I studied awhile and see my chance; then I says: </p> 
<p>"Well, I see the niggers go in there several times." </p> 
<p>Both of them gave a little jump, and looked like they hadn't ever expected it, and then like they HAD. Then the duke says: </p> 
<p>"What, all of them?" </p> 
<p>"No -- leastways, not all at once -- that is, I don't think I ever see them all come OUT at once but just one time." </p> 
<p>"Hello! When was that?" </p> 
<p>"It was the day we had the funeral. In the morning. It warn't early, because I overslept. I was just starting down the ladder, and I see them." </p> 
<p>"Well, go on, GO on! What did they do? How'd they act?" </p> 
<p>"They didn't do nothing. And they didn't act anyway much, as fur as I see. They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they'd shoved in there to do up your majesty's room, or something, s'posing you was up; and found you WARN'T up, and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking you up, if they hadn't already waked you up." </p> 
<p>"Great guns, THIS is a go!" says the king; and both of them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly. They stood there a-thinking and scratching their heads a minute, and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy chuckle, and says: </p> 
<p>"It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand. They let on to be SORRY they was going out of this region! And I believed they WAS sorry, and so did you, and so did everybody. Don't ever tell ME any more that a nigger ain't got any histrionic talent. Why, the way they played that thing it would fool ANYBODY. In my opinion, there's a fortune in 'em. If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn't want a better lay-out than that -- and here we've gone and sold 'em for a song. Yes, and ain't privileged to sing the song yet. Say, where IS that song -- that draft?" </p> 
<p>"In the bank for to be collected. Where WOULD it be?" </p> 
<p>"Well, THAT'S all right then, thank goodness." </p> 
<p>Says I, kind of timid-like: </p> 
<p>"Is something gone wrong?" </p> 
<p>The king whirls on me and rips out: </p> 
<p>"None o' your business! You keep your head shet, and mind y'r own affairs -- if you got any. Long as you're in this town don't you forgit THAT -- you hear?" Then he says to the duke, "We got to jest swaller it and say noth'n': mum's the word for US." </p> 
<p>As they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again, and says: </p> 
<p>"Quick sales AND small profits! It's a good business -- yes." </p> 
<p>The king snarls around on him and says: </p> 
<p>"I was trying to do for the best in sellin' 'em out so quick. If the profits has turned out to be none, lackin' considable, and none to carry, is it my fault any more'n it's yourn?" </p> 
<p>"Well, THEY'D be in this house yet and we WOULDN'T if I could a got my advice listened to." </p> 
<p>The king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swapped around and lit into ME again. He give me down the banks for not coming and TELLING him I see the niggers come out of his room acting that way -- said any fool would a KNOWED something was up. And then waltzed in and cussed HIMSELF awhile, and said it all come of him not laying late and taking his natural rest that morning, and he'd be blamed if he'd ever do it again. So they went off a-jawing; and I felt dreadful glad I'd worked it all off on to the niggers, and yet hadn't done the niggers no harm by it. </p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 来人是玛丽·简。她走到棺材旁，脚步极轻，跪下来朝里看看，然后，她举起手绢，我看到她开始哭了，尽管我听不见，她背对着我。我悄悄走了出去，当我路过餐厅时，我想我应该弄明白那些守灵的人确实没看见我才行，于是，我又打门缝里看，什么事也没。他们没动静。</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 我悄悄回去爬上床，想想自己费了那么大劲，冒了那么大风险，结果却变成了这样，不免稍觉沮丧。我想，要是钱袋能放在那里不动，还挺好；因为等我们到了下游一二百英里地的时候，我就能写封信给玛丽·简，她就能重新把钱挖出来；可事情再不会那样发生了，可能会发生的情况是：当他们来钉棺材盖儿的时候，就会看见那些钱。这样，国王又会重新拿到它。再找机会从他身边偷走可就不知道得过多久啦。当然，我的确想再悄悄地走下去，把钱从那里拿出来，但是，我不想再试了。这时候，每一分钟天就越来越亮，很快，守灵的就会有人醒来，我或许会被人抓住--手上拎着六千块钱，又没人让我代为保管。我可不想被卷到这一类事情里，我心想。</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 早上我下楼时，客厅关上了门，守灵的人走了。在场的就这一家人和巴特莱寡妇，还有我们这一伙。我察看他们的脸色，看是否出了什么事，不过，我没看出来。</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 临近中午，承办丧事的人来了，他们把棺材安置在屋子当中的两把椅子上，然后又把我们的椅子统统摆成排，还从邻居家借了好多椅子，直到把大厅、客厅和餐厅全摆满。我看见棺材盖儿还是照样搁着，不过，四周有人，我不敢往下边看。然后，人们开始挤进来，两个骗子和姑娘坐在前排靠棺材的位子上，有半个小时的时间，人们排成单行，慢慢地绕着棺材走，一个接一个垂下头看一下那个死人的脸，偶尔还会有人掉下几滴泪来，周围很静，庄严肃穆，就那几个姑娘和骗子用手绢捂着眼睛，垂着头，抽抽噎噎几下。什么声音也听不到，只有脚步擦着地板在响，还有擤鼻涕的声音--人们总是在葬礼上擤鼻涕，比其他任何地方都多，教堂除外。</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 等到屋里人全挤满了，那个承办丧事的殡仪员戴着黑手套静静地轻手轻脚地来回走动，在四处关照着，把各项事务都安排得井井有条，稳妥得当，他像只猫一样，悄无声息。他从不说话，他指挥人不断挪动，把来晚的人拉进来，叫别人给让开路，全凭点头和做手势。接着，他自己站到了墙边儿。他是我见过的最轻手轻脚偷偷摸摸又不动声色的人，他不带一丝笑意，像跟火腿肠。</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 他们借来一个手风琴--还有毛病；当大家都准备好了，一个年轻妇女坐下来开始弹琴，吱吱嘎嘎一阵乱响，大家全跟着唱，按我的想法，在场的只有彼得一个人乐得清静。然后，霍布森牧师张口，开始讲话，讲得很慢，相当严肃..葬礼布道词很好，可就是太长了，很腻歪。接着国王又讲话，讲的他那一套废话。终于，事都完了，殡仪员悄悄地拿着螺丝刀向棺材走过来。我急得发慌，眼睛直盯着他。可是他一点儿不多事，只是轻轻地把棺材盖儿推正，拧上螺丝，上得既紧又快。这回我可完啦！我不知道那钱是在里面还是不在。因此，我心想，要是有人把钱偷偷地拿走了呢？现在，我怎么知道该不该给玛丽·简写信呢？如果她挖开墓却什么也找不到，她会如何想呢？糟糕，我想，我或许会被抓起来关进牢里，我最好是隐瞒真情，装作不知，根本就不写信，现在，事情弄得糟极了，本来想做好，结果反倒糟了一百倍，我当初就撒手不管就好啦，真倒霉！</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 他们埋了死人，我们就回家去，我又察颜观色--因为我忍不住，心里不踏实。但是，啥事也没有，我从他们脸上看不出来任何情况。</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 到了晚上，国王到各家走走，跟人们亲热亲热，装着非常友好，他放出风来说，他在英国那边的教友都很急着让他回去，所以，他得尽快把遗产处理完，动身回家。时间如此匆忙，他很难过，大家也这么表示，他们希望他能多住些日子，不过他们也知道那不可能办到。他又说，他和威廉自然要带这几个侄女一块儿回家。这又让大家很高兴，因为这样一来，那几个姑娘就会得到妥善安排，生活在自己亲人身边。这也叫她们很高兴--她们被哄得心花怒放，简直把她们在世上碰到的倒霉事儿给忘得干干净净。她们告诉他想怎么着就怎么着，把东西卖光，越快越好，她们是说走就走。她们这几个可怜虫是那样快活幸福，看着她们被愚弄被欺骗成这样，我的心痛得十分厉害，但是，我又找不到妥善的办法插话，以改变整个事局。</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 啊，国王真的就马上着手，张贴告示，要拍卖房屋、黑奴和全部遗产--拍卖在葬礼之后两天进行；可是，谁想私下提前来买也可以。</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 这样，葬礼过后第二天，临近正午时分，那几个姑娘的兴致遭到了头一回的打击。两个黑奴贩子来了，国王以合理的价格卖给他们黑奴，收了他们所说的那种三天期汇票。他们走了，两个儿子去了上游的孟斐斯，母亲被卖往下游奥尔良。我想那几个可怜的姑娘和黑奴难受得心都快碎了，他们哭成一团，悲痛欲绝，叫我看了也觉得肝肠欲裂，几个姑娘说她们做梦也想不到会眼瞅着这一家人被活活拆散，从这镇上给卖走。那几个可怜悲痛的姑娘和黑奴相互抱头痛哭的场面，我一辈子也忘不了，要不是我清楚了这项买卖无效，黑奴过不了一两个星期就会回来，我想我一点儿也受不了，肯定会脱口而出，告发这两个坏蛋。</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 这事在镇上也引起了轩然大波，很多人直截了当站出来说，把母子这样给活活拆散，实在令人愤慨。两个骗子也有些伤面子，但是，那老混蛋执意要硬干下去，一点儿也不理会公爵好劝歹说，我看得出，公爵心里是特别着急。</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 明天就到了拍卖举行的日子。早上天要大亮时，国王和公爵就来到顶楼，把我喊醒，看他们神情，我就明白出事了。国王问："前天晚上你去我房间了吗？""没有，陛下。"　周围没别人，光是我们几个时，我总这么叫他。</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "昨天或昨天晚上去了没？""没有，陛下。""说老实话，可别撒谎。""是老实话，陛下，我说的是真话。从玛丽·简小姐带您和公爵看房间的时候起，我就从未走进过您的房间。"公爵说道："你看到过别人进去吗？""没有，阁下，我记着没有，我相信。""闭嘴想想。"我装着很认真地想了一会儿，看清楚我有空可钻，然后说："对了，我看见那些黑人进去过几次。"他们俩都吓了一跳，看上去好像是都没料到这一点，然后又像是他们早己料到了。于是，公爵说："什么，他们全进去了？""不是，最起码不是在一次都进去的。也就是说，我记得我没有看见他们全都在一次（出来）过，就那一次。""喂，那一次是什么时候。""是在我们出殡的那天，在早上，也不是太早，由于我睡过头了。我刚开始下梯子，就看见他们了。""快，接着说，接着往下说，他们干什么了？他们有什么举动？""他们没干什么。就我看到的，他们没什么举动。他们踮着脚尖走开了，我看得一清二楚。他们是到陛下的房间里去收拾打扫的，以为您已经起床了，看您还没起来，所以，如果还没把您吵醒的话，他们就希望轻轻地走开，别把您吵醒了惹麻烦。""这话就对啦，这事可糟糕极啦！"　国王说。俩人看着，又难受，又呆傻。他们站在那里挠着头皮想了一分钟，然后，公爵猛然间格格几声冷笑道："这回没什么说的了，黑人这一手耍得多妙啊。他们装作很难受，不愿离开这个地方！我相信他们是难受。你也相信，大家全都相信。别跟我说什么黑人没表演天才吧。啊，他们耍的这一手，骗过了所有的人。依我看，他们还能发财哪。我如果有资金有戏院，我就掏钱请他们表演，那比干什么都强。可在这院，我们却冒冒失失为了那几个钱就卖掉他们。是啊，这会儿还连摸也摸不着那几个钱呢。对了，那几个钱在哪儿？那张汇票？""在银行里等着提款呢。它还能去哪儿？""啊，那就好，谢天谢地。"我怯怯地问："出什么岔子了？"国王挺身冲着我，张嘴骂道："没你的事！别瞎想，管好自己的事吧--如果你有什么要操心的事。但凡你在这个镇上，就别忘了这一点，听好了没？"然后，他又对公爵说，"　我们只得哑巴吃黄连，根本别提这回事：闭紧嘴巴最为要紧。"他们下梯子时，公爵又格格笑起来，他说："卖得快就赚得少！这项买卖做得真好，真的。"国王冲他龇牙裂嘴说道："我快点儿卖掉，本来是想把事情办好。如果事情办完，什么也赚不到反倒赔了不少，一个子儿还带不走，你的错儿比我小吗？""好吧，如果你能听我的话，他们现在还呆在这座房子里，我可早就走了。"国王强词夺理，拚命争辩，又掉过身冲我撒气。他埋怨我看到黑人打他屋里出来又那种举动却没告诉他一声，痛斥我一顿--说哪个傻瓜都能看得出来会出事儿的。接着，他又转而骂了自己一阵，说全怪他那天早上不该睡懒觉，还说他要再这么干就该去下地狱。于是，他们吵着嘴走开了，我特别痛快，把事儿都栽到黑人身上，可对黑人又没什么害处。</p>
