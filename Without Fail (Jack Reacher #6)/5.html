Reacher recognized him from his appearance on the tape. He was tall, broad-shouldered, over fifty, still in reasonable shape. A handsome face, tired eyes. He was wearing a suit and a tie, on a Sunday. Froelich was looking at him, worried. But he in turn was staring straight at Neagley.</p><p>"You're the woman on the video," he said. "In the ballroom, Thursday night."</p><p>He was clearly thinking hard. Running conclusions through his head and then nodding imperceptibly to himself whenever they made sense. After a moment he moved his gaze from Neagley to Reacher and stepped right into the room.</p><p>"And you're Joe Reacher's brother," he said. "You look just like him."</p><p>Reacher nodded.</p><p>"Jack Reacher," he said, and offered his hand.</p><p>Stuyvesant took it.</p><p>"I'm sorry for your loss," he said. "Five years late, I know, but the Treasury Department still remembers your brother with affection."</p><p>Reacher nodded again.</p><p>"This is Frances Neagley," he said.</p><p>"Reacher brought her in to help with the audit," Froelich said.</p><p>Stuyvesant smiled a brief smile.</p><p>"I gathered that," he said. "Smart move. What were the results?"</p><p>The office went quiet.</p><p>"I apologize if I offended you, sir," Froelich said. "You know, before. Talking about the tape like that. I was just explaining the situation."</p><p>"What were the audit results?" Stuyvesant asked again.</p><p>She said nothing back.</p><p>"That bad?" Stuyvesant said to her. "Well, I certainly hope so. I knew Joe Reacher too. Not as well as you did, but we came into contact, time to time. He was impressive. I'm assuming his brother is at least half as smart. Ms. Neagley, probably smarter still. In which case they must have found ways through. Am I right?"</p><p>"Three definites," Froelich said.</p><p>Stuyvesant nodded.</p><p>"The ballroom, obviously," he said. "Probably the family house and that damn outdoors event in Bismarck too. Am I right?"</p><p>"Yes," Froelich said.</p><p>"Extreme levels of performance," Neagley said. "Unlikely to be duplicated."</p><p>Stuyvesant held up his hand and cut her off.</p><p>"Let's go to the conference room," he said. "I want to talk about baseball."</p><p>He led them through narrow winding corridors to a relatively spacious room in the heart of the complex. It had a long table in it with ten chairs, five to a side. No windows. The same gray synthetic carpet underfoot and the same white acoustic tile overhead. The same bright halogen light. There was a low cabinet against one wall. It had closed doors and three telephones on it. Two were white and one was red. Stuyvesant sat down and waved to the chairs on the other side of the table. Reacher glanced at a huge notice board full of memos labeled confidential.</p><p>"I'm going to be uncharacteristically frank," Stuyvesant said. "Just temporarily, you understand, because I think we owe you an explanation, and because Froelich involved you with my initial approval, and because Joe Reacher's brother is family, so to speak, and therefore his colleague is too."</p><p>"We worked together in the military," Neagley said.</p><p>Stuyvesant nodded, like that was an inference he had drawn long ago.</p><p>"Let's talk about baseball," he said. "You follow the game?"</p><p>They all waited.</p><p>"The Washington Senators had already gone when I hit town," he said. "So I've had to make do with the Baltimore Orioles, which has been a mixed bag in terms of fun. But do you understand what's unique about the game?"</p><p>"The length of the season," Reacher said. "The win percentages."</p><p>Stuyvesant smiled, like he was conferring praise.</p><p>"Maybe you're better than half as smart," he said. "The thing about baseball is that the regular season is one hundred sixty-two games long. Way, way longer than any other sport. Any other sport has about half as many games as baseball. Basketball, hockey, football, soccer, anything. Any other sport, the players can start out thinking they can win every single game all season long. It's just about a realistic motivational goal. It's even been achieved, here and there, now and then. But it's impossible in baseball. The very best teams, the greatest champions, they all lose around a third of their games. They lose fifty or sixty times a year, at least. Imagine what that feels like, from a psychological perspective. You're a superb athlete, you're fanatically competitive, but you know for sure you're going to lose repeatedly. You have to make mental adjustments, or you couldn't cope with it. And presidential protection is exactly the same thing. That's my point. We can't win every day. So we get used to it."</p><p>"You only lost once," Neagley said. "Back in 1963."</p><p>"No," Stuyvesant said. "We lose repeatedly. But not every loss is significant. Just like baseball. Not every hit they get produces a run against you, not every defeat they inflict loses you the World Series. And with us, not every mistake kills our guy."</p><p>"So what are you saying?" Neagley asked.</p><p>Stuyvesant sat forward. "I'm saying despite what your audit might have revealed you should still have considerable faith in us. Not every error costs us a run. Now, I completely understand that kind of so-what self-confidence must seem very offhand to an outsider. But you must understand we're forced to think that way. Your audit showed up a few holes, and what we have to do now is judge whether it's possible to fill them. Whether it's reasonable. I'm going to leave that to Froelich's own judgment. It's her show. But what I'm suggesting is that you get rid of any sense of doubt you're feeling about us. As private citizens. Any sense of our failure. Because we're not failing. There are always going to be holes. Part of the job. This is a democracy. Get used to it."</p><p>Then he sat back, like he was finished.</p><p>"What about this specific threat?" Reacher asked him.</p><p>Stuyvesant paused, and then he shook his head. His face had changed. The mood in the whole room had changed.</p><p>"That's precisely where I stop being frank," he said. "I told you it was a temporary indulgence. And it was a very serious lapse on Froelich's part to reveal the existence of any threat at all. All I'm prepared to say is we intercept a lot of threats. Then we deal with them. How we deal with them is entirely confidential. Therefore I would ask you to understand you are now under an absolute obligation never to mention this situation to anybody after you leave here tonight. Or any aspect of our procedures. That obligation is rooted in federal statute. There are sanctions available to me."</p><p>There was silence. Reacher said nothing. Neagley sat quiet. Froelich looked upset. Stuyvesant ignored her completely and gazed hard at Reacher and Neagley, at first hostile, and then suddenly pensive. He started thinking hard again. He stood up and walked over to the low cabinet with the telephones on it. Squatted down in front of it. Opened the doors and took out two yellow legal pads and two ballpoint pens. Walked back and dropped one of each in front of Reacher and one of each in front of Neagley. Circled around the head of the table again and sat back down in his chair.</p><p>"Write your full names," he said. "All and any aliases, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, military ID numbers, and current addresses."</p><p>"What for?" Reacher asked.</p><p>"Just do it," Stuyvesant said.</p><p>Reacher paused and picked up his pen. Froelich looked at him, anxiously. Neagley glanced at him and shrugged and started writing on her pad. Reacher waited a beat and then followed her example. He was finished well before her. He had no middle name and no current address. Stuyvesant walked around behind them and scooped the pads off the table. Said nothing and walked straight out of the room with the pads held tight under his arm. The door slammed loudly behind him.</p><p>"I'm in trouble," Froelich said. "And I've made trouble for you guys, too."</p><p>"Don't worry about it," Reacher said. "He's going to make us sign some kind of confidentiality agreement, is all. He's gone to get them typed up, I guess."</p><p>"But what's he going to do to me?"</p><p>"Nothing, probably."</p><p>"Demote me? Fire me?"</p><p>"He authorized the audit. The audit was necessary because of the threats. The two things were connected. We'll tell him we pushed you with questions."</p><p>"He'll demote me," Froelich said. "He wasn't happy about me running the audit in the first place. Told me it indicated a lack of self-confidence."</p><p>"Bullshit," Reacher said. "We did stuff like that all the time."</p><p>"Audits build self-confidence," Neagley said. "That was our experience. Better to know something for sure than just hope for the best."</p><p>Froelich looked away. Didn't reply. The room went quiet. They all waited, five minutes, then ten, then fifteen. Reacher stood up and stretched. Stepped over to the low cabinet and looked at the red phone. He picked it up and held it to his ear. There was no dial tone. He put it back and scanned the confidential memos on the notice board. The ceiling was low and he could feel heat on his head from the halogen lights. He sat down again and turned his chair and tilted it back and put his feet on the next one in line. Glanced at his watch. Stuyvesant had been gone twenty minutes.</p><p>"Hell is he doing?" he said. "Typing them himself?"</p><p>"Maybe he's calling his agents," Neagley said. "Maybe we're all going to jail, to guarantee our everlasting silence forever."</p><p>Reacher yawned and smiled. "We'll give him ten more minutes. Then we're leaving. We'll all go out and get some dinner."</p><p>Stuyvesant came back after five more. He walked into the room and closed the door. He was carrying no papers. He stepped over and sat down in his original seat and placed his hands flat on the table. Drummed a staccato little rhythm with his fingertips.</p><p>"OK," he said. "Where were we? Reacher had a question, I think."</p><p>Reacher took his feet off the chair and turned to face front.</p><p>"Did I?" he said.</p><p>Stuyvesant nodded. "You asked about this specific threat. Well, it's either an inside job or it's an outside job. It's got to be one or the other, obviously."</p><p>"We're discussing this now?"</p><p>"Yes, we are," Stuyvesant said.</p><p>"Why? What changed?"</p><p>Stuyvesant ignored the question. "If it's an outside job, should we necessarily worry? Perhaps not, because that's like baseball, too. If the Yankees come to town saying they're going to beat the Orioles, does that mean it's true? Boasting about it is not the same thing as actually doing it."</p><p>Nobody spoke.</p><p>"I'm asking for your input here," Stuyvesant said.</p><p>Reacher shrugged.</p><p>"OK," he said. "You think it is an outside threat?"</p><p>"No, I think it's inside intimidation intended to damage Froelich's career. Now ask me what I'm going to do about it."</p><p>Reacher glanced at him. Glanced at his watch. Glanced at the wall. Twenty-five minutes, a Sunday evening, deep inside the D.C.-Maryland-Virginia triangle.</p><p>"I know what you're going to do about it," he said.</p><p>"Do you?"</p><p>"You're going to hire me and Neagley for an internal investigation."</p><p>"Am I?"</p><p>Reacher nodded. "If you're worried about inside intimidation then you need an internal investigation. That's clear. And you can't use one of your own people, because you might hit on the bad guy by chance. And you don't want to bring the FBI in, because that's not how Washington works. Nobody washes their dirty linen in public. So you need some other outsider. And you've got two of them sitting right in front of you. They're already involved, because Froelich just involved them. So either you terminate that involvement, or you choose to expand on it. You'd prefer to expand on it, because that way you don't have to find fault with an excellent agent you just promoted. So can you use us? Of course you can. Who better than Joe Reacher's little brother? Inside Treasury, Joe Reacher is practically a saint. So your ass is covered. And mine is too. Because of Joe I'll get automatic credibility from the start. And I was a good investigator in the military. So was Neagley. You know that, because you just checked. My guess is you just spent twenty-five minutes talking to the Pentagon and the National Security Agency. That's why you wanted those details. They ran us through their computers and we came out clean. More than clean, probably, because I'm sure our security clearances are still on file, and I'm sure they're still way higher than you actually need them to be."</p><p>Stuyvesant nodded. He looked satisfied.</p><p>"An excellent analysis," he said. "You get the job, just as soon as I get hard copies of those clearances. They should be here in an hour or two."</p><p>"You can do this?" Neagley said.</p><p>"I can do what I want," Stuyvesant said. "Presidents tend to give a lot of authority to the people they hope will keep them alive."</p><p>Silence in the room.</p><p>"Will I be a suspect?" Stuyvesant asked.</p><p>"No," Reacher said.</p><p>"Maybe I should be. Maybe I should be your number-one suspect. Perhaps I felt forced to promote a woman because of contemporary pressures to do so, but I secretly resent it, so I'm working behind her back to panic her and thereby discredit her."</p><p>Reacher said nothing.</p><p>"I could have found a friend or a relative who had never been fingerprinted. I could have placed the paper on my desk at seven-thirty Wednesday evening and instructed my secretary not to notice it. She'd have followed my orders. Or I could have instructed the cleaners to smuggle it in that night. They'd have followed my orders, too. But they'd have followed Froelich's orders equally. She should be your number-two suspect, probably. Maybe she has a friend or a relative with no prints on file either, and maybe she's setting this whole thing up in order to deal with it spectacularly and earn some enhanced credibility."</p><p>"Except I'm not setting it up," Froelich said.</p><p>"Neither of you is a suspect," Reacher said.</p><p>"Why not?" Stuyvesant asked.</p><p>"Because Froelich came to me voluntarily, and she knew something about me from my brother. You hired us directly after seeing our military records. Neither of you would have done those things if you had something to hide. Too much risk."</p><p>"Maybe we think we're smarter than you are. An internal investigation that missed us would be the best cover there is."</p><p>Reacher shook his head. "Neither of you is that dumb."</p><p>"Good," Stuyvesant replied. He looked satisfied. "So let's agree it's a jealous rival elsewhere in the department. Let's assume he conspired with the cleaners."</p><p>"Or she," Froelich said.</p><p>"Where are the cleaners now?" Reacher asked.</p><p>"Suspended," Stuyvesant said. "At home, on full pay. They live together. One of the women is the man's wife and the other woman is his sister-in-law. The other crew is working overtime to make up, and costing me a fortune."</p><p>"What's their story?"</p><p>"They know nothing about anything. They didn't bring in any sheet of paper, they never saw it, it wasn't there when they were there."</p><p>"But you don't believe them."</p><p>Stuyvesant was quiet for a long moment. He fiddled with his shirt cuffs and then laid his hands flat on the table again.</p><p>"They're trusted employees," he said. "They're very nervous about being under suspicion. Very upset. Frightened, even. But they're also calm. Like we won't be able to prove anything, because they didn't do anything. They're a little puzzled. They passed a lie-detector test. All three of them."</p><p>"So you do believe them."</p><p>Stuyvesant shook his head. "I can't believe them. How can I? You saw the tapes. Who else put the damn thing there? A ghost?"</p><p>"So what's your opinion?"</p><p>"I think somebody they knew inside the building asked them to do it, and explained it away as a routine test procedure, like a war game or a secret mission, said there was no harm in it, and coached them through what would happen afterward in terms of the video and the questioning and the lie detector. I think that might give a person enough composure to pass the polygraph. If they were convinced they weren't in the wrong and there would be no adverse consequences. If they were convinced they were really helping the department somehow."</p><p>"Have you pursued that with them yet?"</p><p>Stuyvesant shook his head.</p><p>"That'll be your job," he said. "I'm not good at interrogation."</p><p>Reacher said nothing.</p><p>He left as suddenly as he had arrived. Just upped and walked out of the room. The door swung shut behind him and left Reacher and Neagley and Froelich sitting together at the table in the bright light and the silence.</p><p>"You won't be popular," Froelich said. "Internal investigators never are."</p><p>"I'm not interested in being popular," Reacher said.</p><p>"I've already got a job," Neagley said.</p><p>"Take some vacation time," Reacher said. "Stick around, be unpopular with me."</p><p>"Will I get paid?"</p><p>"I'm sure there'll be a fee," Froelich said.</p><p>Neagley shrugged. "OK, I guess my partners could see this as a prestige thing. You know, government work? I could go back to the hotel, make some calls, see if they can cope without me for a spell."</p><p>"You want to get that dinner first?" Froelich asked.</p><p>Neagley shook her head. "No, I'll eat in my room. You two get dinner."</p><p>They wound their way back through the corridors to Froelich's office and she called a driver for Neagley. Then she escorted her down to the garage and came back upstairs to find Reacher sitting quiet at her desk.</p><p>"Are you two having a relationship?" she asked.</p><p>"Who?"</p><p>"You and Neagley."</p><p>"What kind of a question is that?"</p><p>"She was weird about dinner."</p><p>He shook his head. "No, we're not having a relationship."</p><p>"Did you ever? You seem awful close."</p><p>"Do we?"</p><p>"She obviously likes you, and you obviously like her. And she's cute."</p><p>He nodded. "I do like her. And she is cute. But we never had a relationship."</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>"Why not? It just never happened. You know what I mean?"</p><p>"I guess."</p><p>"I'm not sure what it's got to do with you, anyway. You're my brother's ex, not mine. I don't even know your name."</p><p>"M. E.," she said.</p><p>"Martha Enid?" he said. "Mildred Eliza?"</p><p>"Let's go," she said. "Dinner, my place."</p><p>"Your place?"</p><p>"Restaurants are impossible here on Sunday night. And I can't afford them anyway. And I've still got some of Joe's things. Maybe you should have them."</p><p>She lived in a small warm row house in an unglamorous neighborhood across the Anacostia River near Bolling Air Force Base. It was one of those city homes where you close the drapes and concentrate on the inside. There was street parking and a wooden front door with a small foyer behind it that led directly into a living room. It was a comfortable space. Wood floors, a rug, old-fashioned furniture. A small television set with a big cable box wired to it. Some books on a shelf, a small music system with a yard of CDs propped against it. The heaters were turned up high so Reacher peeled off his black jacket and dumped it on the back of a chair.</p><p>"I don't want it to be an insider," Froelich said.</p><p>"Better that than a real outside threat."</p><p>She nodded and moved toward the back of the room where an arch opened into an eat-in kitchen. She looked around, a little vague, like she was wondering what all the machines and cabinets were for.</p><p>"We could send out for Chinese food," Reacher called.</p><p>She took off her jacket and folded it in half and laid it on a stool.</p><p>"Maybe we should," she said.</p><p>She had a white blouse on and without the jacket it looked softer and more feminine. The kitchen was lit with regular bulbs turned low and they were kinder to her skin than the bright office halogen had been. He looked at her and saw what Joe must have seen, eight years previously. She found a take-out menu in a drawer and dialed a number and called in an order. Hot and sour soup and General Tso's chicken, times two.</p><p>"That OK?" she asked.</p><p>"Don't tell me," he said. "It's what Joe liked."</p><p>"I've still got some of his things," she said. "You should come see them."</p><p>She walked ahead of him back to the foyer and up the stairs. There was a guest room at the front of the house. It had a deep closet with a single door. A light bulb came on automatically when she opened it. The closet was full of miscellaneous junk, but the hanging rail had a long line of suits and shirts still wrapped in the dry cleaner's plastic. The plastic had turned a little yellow and brittle with age.</p><p>"These are his," Froelich said.</p><p>"He left them here?" Reacher asked.</p><p>She touched the shoulder of one of the suits through the plastic.</p><p>"I figured he'd come back for them," she said. "But he didn't, the whole year. I guess he didn't need them."</p><p>"He must have had a lot of suits."</p><p>"Couple dozen, I guess," she said.</p><p>"How can a person have twenty-four suits?"</p><p>"He was a dresser," she said. "You must remember that."</p><p>He stood still. The way he remembered it, Joe had lived in one pair of shorts and one T-shirt. In the winters he wore khakis. When it was very cold he added a worn-out leather pilot's jacket. That was it. At their mother's funeral he wore a very formal black suit, which Reacher had assumed was rented. But maybe it wasn't. Maybe working in Washington had changed his approach.</p><p>"You should have them," Froelich said. "They're your property, anyway. You were his next of kin, I guess."</p><p>"I guess I was," he said.</p><p>"There's a box, too," she said. "Stuff he left around and never came back for."</p><p>He followed her gaze to the closet floor and saw a cardboard box sitting underneath the hanging rail. The flaps were folded over each other.</p><p>"Tell me about Molly Beth Gordon," he said.</p><p>"What about her?"</p><p>"After they died I kind of inferred they'd had a thing going."</p><p>She shook her head. "They were close. No doubt about that. But they worked together. She was his assistant. He wouldn't date people in the office."</p><p>"Why did you break up?" he asked.</p><p>The doorbell rang downstairs. It sounded loud in the Sunday hush.</p><p>"The food," Froelich said.</p><p>They went down and ate together at the kitchen table, silently. It felt curiously intimate, but also distant. Like sitting next to a stranger on a long plane ride. You feel connected, but also not connected.</p><p>"You can stay here tonight," she said. "If you like."</p><p>"I didn't check out of the hotel."</p><p>She nodded. "So check out tomorrow. Then base yourself here."</p><p>"What about Neagley?"</p><p>Silence for a beat.</p><p>"Her, too, if she wants. There's another bedroom on the third floor."</p><p>"OK," he said.</p><p>They finished the meal and he put the containers in the trash and rinsed the plates. She set the dishwasher going. Then her phone rang. She stepped through to the living room to answer it. Talked for a long moment and then hung up and came back.</p><p>"That was Stuyvesant," she said. "He's giving you the formal go-ahead."</p><p>He nodded. "So call Neagley and tell her to get her ass in gear."</p><p>"Now?"</p><p>"Get a problem, solve a problem," he said. "That's my way. Tell her to be out front of the hotel in thirty minutes."</p><p>"Where are you going to start?"</p><p>"With the video," he said. "I want to watch the tapes again. And I want to meet with the guy who runs that part of the operation."</p><p>Thirty minutes later they scooped Neagley off the sidewalk in front of the hotel. She had changed into a black suit with a short jacket. The pants were cut tight. They looked pretty good from the back, in Reacher's opinion. He saw Froelich arrive at the same conclusion. But she said nothing. Just drove, five minutes, and then they were back in the Secret Service offices. Froelich headed straight for her desk and left Reacher and Neagley with the agent who ran the video surveillance. He was a small thin nervous guy in Sunday clothes who had come in at short notice to meet with them. He looked a little dazed about it. He led them to a closet-sized equipment room full of racks of recorders. One wall was a floor-to-ceiling shelving unit with hundreds of VHS tapes stacked neatly in black plastic boxes. The recorders themselves were plain gray industrial units. The whole tiny space was full of neat wiring and procedural memos tacked to the walls and soft noise from small motors turning and the smell of warm circuit boards and the green glow of LED numbers ticking over relentlessly.</p><p>"System really looks after itself," the guy said. "There are four recorders slaved to each camera, six hours to a tape, so we change all the tapes once a day, file them away, keep them three months, and then reuse them."</p><p>"Where are the originals from the night in question?" Reacher asked.</p><p>"Right here," the guy said. He fiddled in his pocket and came out with a bunch of small brass keys on a ring. Squatted down in the limited space and opened a low cupboard. Took out three boxes.</p><p>"These are the three I copied for Froelich," he said, on his knees.</p><p>"Some place where we can look at them?"</p>       <amp-ad

          </amp-ad><p>"They're no different than the copies."</p><p>"Copying causes detail loss," Reacher said. "First rule, start with the originals."</p><p>"OK," the guy said. "You can look at them right here, I guess."</p><p>He stood up awkwardly and pushed and pulled some equipment around on a bench and angled a small monitor outward and switched on a stand-alone player. A blank gray square appeared on the screen.</p><p>"No remotes on these things," he said. "You have to use the buttons."</p><p>He stacked the three tape boxes in the correct time sequence.</p><p>"Got chairs?" Reacher asked.</p><p>The guy ducked out and came back dragging two typist's chairs. They tangled in the doorway and he had trouble fitting them both in front of the narrow bench. Then he glanced around like he was unhappy about leaving strangers alone in his little domain.</p><p>"I guess I'll wait in the foyer," he said. "Call me when you're through."</p><p>"What's your name?" Neagley asked.</p><p>"Nendick," the guy said, shyly.</p><p>"OK, Nendick," she said. "We'll be sure to call you."</p><p>He left the room and Reacher put the third tape in the machine.</p><p>"You know what?" Neagley said. "That guy didn't sneak a peek at my ass."</p><p>"Didn't he?"</p><p>"Guys usually do when I'm wearing these pants."</p><p>"Do they?"</p><p>"Usually."</p><p>Reacher kept his gaze firmly on the blank video screen.</p><p>"Maybe he's gay," he said.</p><p>"He was wearing a wedding band."</p><p>"Then maybe he tries hard to avoid inappropriate feelings. Or maybe he's tired."</p><p>"Or maybe I'm getting old," she said.</p><p>He hit fast rewind. The motor whirred.</p><p>"Third tape," he said. "Thursday morning. We'll do this backward."</p><p>The player spooled fast. He watched the counter and hit play and the picture came up with an empty office with the timecode burned in over it showing the relevant Thursday's date and the time at seven fifty-five A.M. He hit forward scan and then froze the picture when the secretary entered the frame at exactly eight o'clock in the morning. He settled in his chair and hit play and the secretary walked into the square area and took off her coat and hung it on the rack. Walked within three feet of Stuyvesant's door and bent down behind her desk.</p><p>"Stowing her purse," Neagley said. "On the floor in the footwell."</p><p>The secretary was a woman of maybe sixty. For a moment she was face-on to the camera. She was a matronly figure. Stern, but kindly. She sat down heavily and hitched her chair in and opened a book on the desk.</p><p>"Checking the diary," Neagley said.</p><p>The secretary stayed firmly in her chair, busy with the diary. Then she started in on a tall stack of memos. She filed some of them in a drawer and used her rubber stamp on others and moved them right to left across her desk.</p><p>"You ever see so much paperwork?" Reacher said. "Worse than the Army."</p><p>The secretary broke off from her memo stack twice, to answer the phone. But she didn't move from her chair. Reacher fast-forwarded until Stuyvesant himself swept into view at ten past eight. He was wearing a dark raincoat, maybe black or charcoal. He was carrying a slim briefcase. He took off his coat and hung it on the rack. Advanced into the square area and the secretary's head moved like she was speaking to him. He set his briefcase on her desk at an exact angle and adjusted its position. Bent to confer with her. Nodded once and straightened up and stepped to his door without his briefcase and disappeared into his office. The timer ticked off four seconds. Then he was back out in the doorway, calling to his secretary.</p><p>"He found it," Reacher said.</p><p>"The briefcase thing is weird," Neagley said. "Why would he leave it?"</p><p>"Maybe he had an early meeting," Reacher said. "Maybe he left it out there because he knew he was leaving again right away."</p><p>He fast-forwarded through the next hour. People ducked in and out of the office. Froelich made two trips. Then a forensic team arrived and left twenty minutes later with the letter in a plastic evidence bag. He hit reverse scan. The whole morning's activity unfolded again, backward. The forensic team left and then arrived, Froelich came out and in twice, Stuyvesant arrived and left, and then his secretary did the same.</p><p>"Now for the boring part," Reacher said. "Hours and hours of nothing."</p><p>The picture settled to a steady shot of an empty area with the timer rushing backward. Absolutely nothing happened. The level of detail coming off the original tape was better than the copy, but there wasn't much in it. It was gray and milky. OK for a surveillance situation, but it wouldn't have won any technical awards.</p><p>"You know what?" Reacher said. "I was a cop for thirteen years, and I never found anything significant on a surveillance tape. Not even once."</p><p>"Me neither," Neagley said. "The hours I spent like this."</p><p>At six A.M. the tape jammed to a stop and Reacher ejected it and fast wound the second tape to the far end and started the patient backward search again. The timer sped through five o'clock and headed fast toward four. Nothing happened. The office just sat there, still and gray and empty.</p><p>"Why are we doing this tonight?" Neagley asked.</p><p>"Because I'm an impatient guy," Reacher said.</p><p>"You want to score one for the military, don't you? You want to show these civilians how the real pros work."</p><p>"Nothing left to prove," Reacher said. "We already scored three and a half."</p><p>He bent closer to the screen. Fought to keep his eyes focused. Four o'clock in the morning. Nothing was happening. Nobody was delivering any letters.</p><p>"Or maybe there's another reason we're doing this tonight," Neagley said. "Maybe you're trying to outpoint your brother."</p><p>"Don't need to. I know exactly how we compared. And it doesn't matter to me what anybody else thinks about it."</p><p>"What happened to him?"</p><p>"He died."</p><p>"I gathered that, belatedly. But how?"</p><p>"He was killed. In the line of duty. Just after I left the Army. Down in Georgia, south of Atlanta. Clandestine rendezvous with an informer from a counterfeiting operation. They were ambushed. He was shot in the head, twice."</p><p>"They get the guys who did it?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"That's awful."</p><p>"Not really. I got them instead."</p><p>"What did you do?"</p><p>"What do you think?"</p><p>"OK, how?"</p><p>"It was a father-and-son team. I drowned the son in a swimming pool. I burned the father to death in a fire. After shooting him in the chest with a hollow-point.44."</p><p>"That ought to do it."</p><p>"Moral of the story, don't mess with me or mine. I just wish they'd known that ahead of time."</p><p>"Any comeback?"</p><p>"I exfiltrated fast. Stayed out of circulation. Had to miss the funeral."</p><p>"Bad business."</p><p>"The guy he was meeting with got it, too. Bled to death under a highway ramp. There was a woman, as well. From Joe's office. His assistant, Molly Beth Gordon. They knifed her at the Atlanta airport."</p><p>"I saw her name. On the roll of honor."</p><p>Reacher was quiet a beat. The video sped backward. Three in the morning, then two-fifty-something. Then two-forty. Nothing happening.</p><p>"The whole thing was a can of worms," he said. "It was his own fault, really."</p><p>"That's harsh."</p><p>"It was a stretch for him. I mean, would you get ambushed at a rendezvous?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Me neither."</p><p>"I'd do all the usual stuff," Neagley said. "You know, arrive three hours early, stake it out, surveil, block the approaches."</p><p>"But Joe didn't do any of that. He was out of his depth. Thing about Joe, he looked tough. He was six-six, two-fifty, built like a brick outhouse. Hands like shovels, face like a catcher's mitt. We were clones, physically, the two of us. But we had different brains. Deep down, he was a cerebral guy. Kind of pure. Naive, even. He never thought dirty. Everything was a game of chess with him. He gets a call, he sets up a meet, he drives down there. Like he's moving his knight or his bishop around. He just didn't expect somebody to come along and blow the whole chessboard away."</p><p>Neagley said nothing. The tape sped on backward. Nothing was happening on it. The square office area just sat there, dim and steady.</p><p>"Afterward I was angry he was so careless," Reacher said. "But then I figured I couldn't blame him for that. To be careless, first of all you've got to know what you're supposed to be careful about. And he just didn't. He didn't know. He didn't see stuff like that. Didn't think that way."</p><p>"So?"</p><p>"So I guess I was angry I didn't do it for him."</p><p>"Could you have?"</p><p>He shook his head. "I hadn't seen him for seven years. I had no idea where he was. He had no idea where I was. But somebody like me should have done it for him. He should have asked for help."</p><p>"Too proud?"</p><p>"No, too naive. That's the bottom line."</p><p>"Could he have reacted? At the scene?"</p><p>Reacher made a face. "They were pretty good, I guess. Semiproficient, by our standards. There must have been some chance. But it would have been a split-second thing, purely instinctive. And Joe's instincts were all buried under the cerebral stuff. He probably stopped to think. He always did. Just enough to make him come out timid."</p><p>"Naive and timid," Neagley said. "They don't share that opinion around here."</p><p>"Around here he must have looked like a wild man. Everything's comparative."</p><p>Neagley shifted in her chair and watched the screen.</p><p>"Stand by," she said. "The witching hour approaches."</p><p>The timer spun back through half past midnight. The office was undisturbed. Then at sixteen minutes past midnight the cleaning crew rushed backward out of the gloom of the exit corridor. Reacher watched them at high speed until they reversed into Stuyvesant's office at seven minutes past. Then he ran the tape forward at normal speed and watched them come out again and clean the secretarial station.</p><p>"What do you think?" he asked.</p><p>"They look pretty normal," Neagley said.</p><p>"If they'd just left the letter in there, would they look so composed?"</p><p>They weren't hurrying. They weren't furtive or anxious or stressed or excited. They weren't glancing backward at Stuyvesant's door. They were just cleaning, efficiently and speedily. He reversed the tape again and sped back through seven minutes past midnight and onward until it jammed to a stop at midnight exactly. He ejected it and inserted the first tape. Wound to the far end and scanned backward until they first entered the picture just before eleven fifty-two. Ran the tape forward and watched them walk into shot and froze the tape when they were all clearly visible.</p><p>"So where would it be?" he asked.</p><p>"Like Froelich speculated," Neagley said. "Could be anywhere."</p><p>He nodded. She was right. Between the three of them and the cleaning cart, they could have concealed a dozen letters.</p><p>"Do they look worried?" he asked.</p><p>She shrugged. "Run the tape. See how they move."</p><p>He let them walk onward. They headed straight for Stuyvesant's door and disappeared from view inside, eleven fifty-two exactly.</p><p>"Show me again," Neagley said.</p><p>He ran the segment again. Neagley leaned back and half-closed her eyes.</p><p>"Their energy level is a little different than when they came out," she said.</p><p>"You think?"</p><p>She nodded. "A little slower? Like they're hesitant?"</p><p>"Or like they're dreading having to do something bad in there?"</p><p>He ran it again.</p><p>"I don't know," she said. "Kind of hard to interpret. And it's no kind of evidence, that's for sure. Just a subjective feeling."</p><p>He ran it again. There was no real overt difference. Maybe they looked a little less wired going in than coming out. Or more tired. But then, they spent fifteen minutes in there. And it was a relatively small office. Already quite clean and neat. Maybe it was their habit to take a ten-minute rest in there, out of sight of the camera. Cleaners weren't dumb. Maybe they put their feet on the desk, not a letter.</p><p>"I don't know," Neagley said again.</p><p>"Inconclusive?" Reacher said.</p><p>"Naturally. But who else have we got?"</p><p>"Nobody at all."</p><p>He hit fast rewind and stared at nothing until he found eight o'clock in the evening. The secretary got up from her desk, put her head around Stuyvesant's door, and went home. He wound back to seven thirty-one and watched Stuyvesant himself leave.</p><p>"OK," he said. "The cleaners did it. On their own initiative?"</p><p>"I seriously doubt it."</p><p>"So who told them to?"</p><p>They stopped in the foyer and found Nendick and sent him back to tidy up his equipment room. Then they went in search of Froelich and found her deep in a stack of paperwork at her desk, on the phone, coordinating Brook Armstrong's return from Camp David.</p><p>"We need to speak with the cleaners," Reacher said.</p><p>"Now?" Froelich said.</p><p>"No better time. Late-night interrogation always works best."</p><p>She looked blank. "OK, I'll drive you, I guess."</p><p>"Better that you're not there," Neagley said.</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>"We're military. We'll probably want to slap them around some."</p><p>Froelich stared at her. "You can't do that. They're department members, no different than me."</p><p>"She's kidding," Reacher said. "But they're going to feel better talking to us if there's nobody else from the department around."</p><p>"OK, I'll wait outside. But I'm going with you."</p><p>She finished up her phone calls and tidied up her paperwork and then led them back to the elevator and down to the garage. They climbed into the Suburban and Reacher closed his eyes for twenty minutes as she drove. He was tired. He had been working hard for six days straight. Then the car came to a stop and he opened his eyes again in a mean neighborhood full of ten-year-old sedans and hurricane fencing. There was orange glow from streetlights here and there. Patched blacktop and scrawny weeds in the sidewalks. The thump of a loud car stereo blocks away.</p><p>"This is it," Froelich said. "Number 2301."</p><p>Number 2301 was the left-hand half of a two-family house. It was a low clapboard structure with paired front doors in the center and symmetrical windows left and right. There was a low wire fence defining a front yard. The yard had a lawn that was partly dead. No bushes or flowers or shrubs. But it was neat enough. No trash. The steps up to the door were swept clean.</p><p>"I'll wait right here," Froelich said.</p><p>Reacher and Neagley climbed out of the car. The night air was cold and the distant stereo was louder. They went in through the gate. Up a cracked concrete walk to the door. Reacher pressed the bell and heard it sound inside the house. They waited. Heard the slap of footsteps on what sounded like a bare floor, and then something metal being hauled out of the way. The door opened and a man stood there, holding the handle. He was the cleaner from the video, no doubt about it. They had looked at him forward and backward for hours. He was not young, not old. Not short, not tall. Just a completely average guy. He was wearing cotton pants and a Redskins sweatshirt. His skin was dark and his cheekbones were high and flat. His hair was black and glossy, with an old-fashioned cut still crisp and neat around the edges.</p><p>"Yes?" he said.</p><p>"We need to talk about the thing at the office," Reacher said.</p><p>The guy didn't ask any questions. Didn't ask for ID. Just glanced at Reacher's face and stepped backward and over the thing he had moved to get the door open. It was a child's seesaw made out of brightly colored curved metal tubes. It had little seats at each end, like you might see on a child's tricycle, and plastic horses' heads with little handlebars coming out of the sides below the ears.</p><p>"Can't leave it outside at night," the guy said. "It would be stolen."</p><p>Neagley and Reacher climbed over it into a narrow hallway. There were more toys neatly packed onto shelves. Bright grade-school paintings visible on the front of the refrigerator in the kitchen. The smell of cooking. There was a living room off the hallway with two silent, scared women in it. They were wearing Sunday dresses, which were very different from their work overalls.</p><p>"We need to know your names," Neagley said.</p><p>Her voice was halfway between warm friendliness and the cold knell of doom. Reacher smiled to himself. That was Neagley's way. He remembered it well. Nobody ever argued with her. It was one of her strengths.</p><p>"Julio," the man said.</p><p>"Anita," the first woman said. Reacher assumed she was Julio's wife, by the way she glanced at him before answering.</p><p>"Maria," the second woman said. "I'm Anita's sister."</p><p>There was a small sofa and two armchairs. Anita and Maria squeezed up to let Julio sit with them on the sofa. Reacher took that as an invitation and sat down in one of the armchairs. Neagley took the other. It put the two of them at a symmetrical angle, like the sofa was a television screen and they were sitting down to watch it.</p><p>"We think you guys put the letter in the office," Neagley said.</p><p>There was no reply. No reaction at all. No expression on the three faces. Just some kind of silent blank stoicism.</p><p>"Did you?" Neagley asked.</p><p>No reply.</p><p>"The kids in bed?" Reacher asked.</p><p>"They're not here," Anita said.</p><p>"Are they yours or Maria's?"</p><p>"They're mine."</p><p>"Boys or girls?"</p><p>"Both girls."</p><p>"Where are they?"</p><p>She paused a beat. "With cousins."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Because we work nights."</p><p>"Not for much longer," Neagley said. "You won't be working at all, unless you tell somebody something."</p><p>No response.</p><p>"No more health insurance, no more benefits."</p><p>No response.</p><p>"You might even go to jail."</p><p>Silence in the room.</p><p>"Whatever happens to us will happen," Julio said.</p><p>"Did somebody ask you to put it there? Somebody you know in the office?"</p><p>Absolutely no response.</p><p>"Somebody you know outside the office?"</p><p>"We didn't do anything with any letter."</p><p>"So what did you do?" Reacher asked.</p><p>"We cleaned. That's what we're there for."</p><p>"You were in there an awful long time."</p><p>Julio looked at his wife, like he was puzzled.</p><p>"We saw the tape," Reacher said.</p><p>"We know about the cameras," Julio said.</p><p>"You follow the same routine every night?"</p><p>"We have to."</p><p>"Spend that long in there every night?"</p><p>Julio shrugged. "I guess so."</p><p>"You rest up in there?"</p><p>"No, we clean."</p><p>"Same every night?"</p><p>"Everything's the same every night. Unless somebody's spilled some coffee or left a lot of trash around or something. That might slow us up some."</p><p>"Was there something like that in Stuyvesant's office that night?"</p><p>"No," Julio said. "Stuyvesant is a clean guy."</p><p>"You spent some big amount of time in there."</p><p>"No more than usual."</p><p>"You got an exact routine?"</p><p>"I guess so. We vacuum, wipe things off, empty the trash, put things neat, move on to the next office."</p><p>Silence in the room. Just the faint thump of the far-off car stereo, much attenuated by the walls and the windows.</p><p>"OK," Neagley said. "Listen up, guys. The tape shows you going in there. Afterward, there was a letter on the desk. We think you put it there because somebody asked you to. Maybe they told you it was a joke or a trick. Maybe they told you it was OK to do it. And it was OK. There's no harm done. But we need to know who asked you. Because this is part of the game, too, us trying to find out. And now you've got to tell us, otherwise the game is over and we have to figure you put it there off of your own bat. And that's not OK. That's real bad. That's making a threat against the Vice President-elect of the United States. And you can go to prison for that."</p><p>No reaction. Another long silence.</p><p>"Are we going to get fired?" Maria asked.</p><p>"Aren't you listening?" Neagley said. "You're going to jail, unless you tell us who it was."</p><p>Maria's face went still, like a stone. And Anita's, and Julio's. Still faces, blank eyes, stoic miserable expressions straight from a thousand years of peasant experience: sooner or later, the harvest always fails.</p><p>"Let's go," Reacher said.</p><p>They stood up and stepped through to the hallway. Climbed over the seesaw and let themselves out into the night. Made it back to the Suburban in time to see Froelich snapping her cell phone shut. There was panic in her eyes.</p><p>"What?" Reacher asked.</p><p>"We got another one," she said. "Ten minutes ago. And it's worse."</p> </div> </div> <div class="row turn-page"> <a class="col-xs-2" href="/Without%20Fail%20(Jack%20Reacher%20%236)/4.html?v=1662297475699">Previous</a> <a class="col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:center;" href="/Without%20Fail%20(Jack%20Reacher%20%236)/book.html?v=1662297475698">Table</a> <a class="col-xs-2 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:right;" href="/Without%20Fail%20(Jack%20Reacher%20%236)/6.html?v=1662297475700"> Next</a> </div> <hr></div><hr><footer class="container"> <p>© Company 2014</p></footer><amp-lightbox id="searchLightbox" class="-il" layout="nodisplay" on="lightboxOpen:searchInput.focus; lightboxClose:searchTriggerOpen.focus" scrollable="" hidden="hidden"> <div> <div class="-ic" role="button" tabindex="0" on="tap:searchLightbox.close"></div> <div class="-ih"> <div class="-sg -sb" on="tap: searchLightbox.close, AMP.setState({ query: '' }), searchForm.clear" role="button" tabindex="0"> <div class="ap-a-ico -sw"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#close"></use> </svg> </div> </div> <div class="ap-o-search-field"> <form action="#" action-xhr="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/echo" class="-ip" id="searchForm" on="submit:AMP.setState({ query: throttledValue }),searchResult.focus" target="_top"> <amp-autocomplete class="-id" filter="substring" min-characters="1" on="select:AMP.setState({ query: event.value })" submit-on-enter="false" src="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/autosuggest"> <div class="ap-a-ico -im"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#search"></use> </svg> </div> <input id="searchInput" class="-iv" name="q" placeholder="What are you looking for?" on="input-throttled:AMP.setState({ throttledValue: event.value })" required=""> <button class="-ig" type="submit" name="search-submit" disabled="" [disabled]="!throttledValue">Search </button> <div role="listbox"></div> </amp-autocomplete> </form> <div class="empty" [class]="query ?
