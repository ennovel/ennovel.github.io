She had tried telephoning George there several times, but there had been no answer. She hoped he would not be angry because she had been detained. It had been a stupid mix-up. Early that afternoon, as Alexandra was leaving for Dark Harbor, the phone had rung. She had thought, I'm late. Let it ring, and had gone out to the car. The maid had come hurrying after her.</p><p>"Mrs. Mellis! It's your sister. She says it is urgent."</p><p>When Alexandra picked up the telephone, Eve said, "Darling, I'm in Washington, D.C. I'm having a terrible problem. I have to see you."</p><p>"Of course," Alexandra said instantly. "I'm leaving for Dark Harbor now to meet George, but I'll be back Monday morning and - "</p><p>"This can't wait." Eve sounded desperate. "Will you meet me at La Guardia Airport? I'll be on the five o'clock plane."</p><p>"I'd like to, Eve, but I told George - "</p><p>"This is an emergency, Alex. But, of course, if you're too busy..."</p><p>"Wait! All right. I'll be there."</p><p>"Thanks, darling. I knew I could count on you."</p><p>It was so seldom that Eve asked her for a favor, she could not refuse her. She would catch a later plane to the island. She telephoned George at the office to tell him she would be detained, but he was not in. She left a message with his secretary. An hour later she took a taxi to La Guardia in time to meet the five o'clock plane from Washington. Eve was not on it. Alexandra waited for two hours, and there was still no sign of Eve. Alexandra had no idea where to reach Eve in Washington. Finally, because there was nothing else she could do, Alexandra took a plane to the island. Now as she approached Cedar Hill House, she found it dark. Surely George should have arrived by now. Alexandra went from room to room, turning on the lights.</p><p>"George?"</p><p>There was no sign of him. She telephoned her home in Manhattan. The maid answered.</p><p>"Is Mr. Mellis there?" Alexandra asked.</p><p>"Why, no, Mrs. Mellis. He said you would both be away for the weekend."</p><p>"Thank you, Marie. He must have been detained somewhere."</p><p>There had to be a logical reason for his absence. Obviously some business had come up at the last minute and, as usual, the partners had asked George to handle it. He would be along at any moment. She dialed Eve's number.</p><p>"Eve!" Alexandra exclaimed. "What on earth happened to you?"</p><p>"What happened to you? I waited at Kennedy, and when you didn't show up - "</p><p>"Kennedy! You said La Guardia."</p><p>"No, darling, Kennedy."</p><p>"But - " It did not matter any longer. "I'm sorry," Alexandra said. "I must have misunderstood. Are you all right?"</p><p>Eve said, "I am now. I've had a hellish time. I got involved with a man who's a big political figure in Washington. He's insanely jealous and - " She laughed. "I can't go into the details over the telephone. The phone company will take out both our phones. I'll tell you all about it Monday."</p><p>"All right," Alexandra said. She was enormously relieved.</p><p>"Have a nice weekend," Eve told her. "How's George?"</p><p>"He's not here." Alexandra tried to keep the note of concern out of her voice. "I suppose he got tied up on business and hasn't had a chance to call me."</p><p>"I'm sure you'll hear from him soon. Good night, darling."</p><p>"Good night, Eve."</p><p>Alexandra replaced the receiver and thought, It would be nice if Eve found someone really wonderful. Someone as good and kind as George. She looked at her watch. It was almost eleven o'clock. Surely he would have had a chance to call by now. She picked up the telephone and dialed the number of the brokerage firm. There was no answer. She telephoned his club. No, they had not seen Mr. Mellis. By midnight, Alexandra was alarmed, and by one A.M. she was in a state of panic. She was not sure what to do. It was possible that George was out with a client and could not get to a telephone, or perhaps he had had to fly somewhere and had not been able to reach her before he left. There was some simple explanation. If she called the police and George walked in, she would feel like a fool.</p><p>At 2:00 A.M. she telephoned the police. There was no police force on the island of Islesboro itself, and the closest station was in Waldo County.</p><p>A sleepy voice said, "Waldo County Sheriff's Department. Sergeant Lambert."</p><p>"This is Mrs. George Mellis at Cedar Hill House."</p><p>"Yes, Mrs. Mellis." The voice was instantly alert. "What can I do for you?"</p><p>"To tell you the truth, I'm not sure," Alexandra said hesitantly. "My husband was supposed to have met me at the house earlier this evening, and he - he hasn't shown up."</p><p>"I see." There were all kinds of implications in that phrase. The sergeant knew at least three reasons why a husband could be away from home at two A.M. in the morning: blondes, brunets and redheads.</p><p>He said tactfully, "Is it possible he was detained on business somewhere?"</p><p>"He - he usually calls."</p><p>"Well, you know how it is, Mrs. Mellis. Sometimes you get in a situation where you can't call. I'm sure you'll be hearing from him."</p><p>Now she did feel like a fool. Of course there was nothing the police could do. She had read somewhere that a person had to be missing for twenty-four hours before the police would even start looking for him, and George was not missing, for heaven's sake. He was just late.</p><p>"I'm sure you're right," Alexandra said into the telephone. "I'm sorry to have troubled you."</p><p>"Not at all, Mrs. Mellis. I'll bet he'll be on the seven o'clock ferry first thing in the morning."</p><p>He was not on the seven o'clock ferry, or the one after that. Alexandra telephoned the Manhattan house again. George was not there.</p><p>A feeling of disaster began to grip Alexandra. George had been in an accident; he was in a hospital somewhere, ill or dead. If only there had not been the mix-up with Eve at the airport. Perhaps George had arrived at the house, and when he found she was not there, he had gone. But that left too many things unexplained. He would have left a note. He could have surprised burglars and been attacked or kidnapped. Alexandra went through the house, room by room, looking for any possible clue. Everything was intact. She went down to the dock. The Corsair was there, safely moored.</p><p>She telephoned the Waldo County Sheriff's Department again. Lieutenant Philip Ingram, a twenty-year veteran of the force, was on morning duty. He was already aware that George Mellis had not been home all night. It had been the chief topic of conversation around the station all morning, most of it ribald.</p><p>Now he said to Alexandra, "There's no trace of him at all, Mrs. Mellis? All right. I'll come out there myself." He knew it would be a waste of time. Her old man was probably tomcatting around in some alley. But when the Blackwells call, the peasants come running, he thought wryly. Anyway, this was a nice lady. He had met her a few times over the years.</p><p>"Back in an hour or so," he told the desk sergeant.</p><p>Lieutenant Ingram listened to Alexandra's story, checked the house and the dock and reached the conclusion that Alexandra Mellis had a problem on her hands. George Mellis was to have met his wife the evening before at Dark Harbor, but he had not shown up. While it was not Lieutenant Ingram's problem, he knew it would do him no harm to be helpful to a member of the Blackwell family. Ingram telephoned the island airport and the ferry terminal at Lincolnville. George Mellis had used neither facility within the past twenty-four hours. "He didn't come to Dark Harbor," the lieutenant told Alexandra. And where the hell did that leave things? Why would the man have dropped out of sight? In the lieutenant's considered opinion, no man in his right mind would voluntarily leave a woman like Alexandra.</p><p>"We'll check the hospitals and mor - " He caught himself. "And other places, and I'll put out an APB on him."</p><p>Alexandra was trying to control her emotions, but he could see what an effort it was. "Thank you, Lieutenant. I don't have to tell you how much I'll appreciate anything you can do."</p><p>"That's my job," Lieutenant Ingram replied.</p><p>When Lieutenant Ingram returned to the station, he began calling hospitals and morgues. The responses were negative. There was no accident report on George Mellis. Lieutenant Ingram's next move was to call a reporter friend on the Maine Courier. After that, the lieutenant sent out a missing person all-points-bulletin.</p><p>The afternoon newspapers carried the story in headlines: HUSBAND OF BLACKWELL HEIRESS MISSING.</p><p>Peter Templeton first heard the news from Detective Nick Pappas.</p><p>"Peter, remember askin' me a while ago to do some checkin' on George Mellis?"</p><p>"Yes..."</p><p>"He's done a vanishing act."</p><p>"He's what?"</p><p>"Disappeared, vamoosed, gone." He waited while Peter digested the news.</p><p>"Did he take anything with him? Money, clothes, passport?"</p><p>"Nope. According to the report we got from Maine, Mr. Mellis just melted into thin air. You're his shrink. I thought you might have some idea why our boy would do a thing like that."</p><p>Peter said truthfully, "I haven't any idea, Nick."</p><p>"If you think of anything, let me know. There's gonna be a lot of heat on this."</p><p>"Yes," Peter promised. "I will."</p><p>Thirty minutes later, Alexandra Mellis telephoned Peter Templeton, and he could hear the shrill edge of panic in her voice. "I - George is missing. No one seems to know what happened to him. I was hoping he might have told you something that might have given you a clue or - " She broke off.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Mrs. Mellis. He didn't. I have no idea what could have happened."</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>Peter wished there was some way he could comfort her. "If I think of anything, I'll call you back. Where can I reach you?"</p><p>"I'm at Dark Harbor now, but I'm going to return to New York this evening. I'll be at my grandmother's."</p><p>Alexandra could not bear the thought of being alone. She had talked to Kate several times that morning. "Oh, darling, I'm sure there's nothing to worry about," Kate said. "He probably went off on some business deal and forgot to tell you."</p><p>Neither of them believed it.</p><p>Eve saw the story of George's disappearance on television. There were photographs of the exterior of Cedar Hill House, and pictures of Alexandra and George after their wedding ceremony. There was a close-up of George, looking upward, with his eyes wide. Somehow it reminded Eve of the look of surprise on his face just before he died.</p><p>The television commentator was saying, "There has been no evidence of foul play and no ransom demands have been made. The police speculate that George Mellis was possibly the victim of an accident and may be suffering from amnesia." Eve smiled in satisfaction.</p><p>They would never find the body. It had been swept out to sea with the tide. Poor George. He had followed her plan perfectly. But she had changed it. She had flown up to Maine and rented a motorboat at Philbrook Cove, to be held for "a friend." She had then rented a second boat from a nearby dock and taken it to Dark Harbor, where she had waited for George. He had been totally unsuspecting. She had been careful to wipe the deck clean before she returned the yacht to the dock. After that, it had been a simple matter to tow George's rented motorboat back to its pier, return her boat and fly back to New York to await the telephone call she knew Alexandra would make.</p><p>It was a perfect crime. The police would list it as a mysterious disappearance.</p><p>The announcer was saying, "In other news..." Eve switched the television set off.</p><p>She did not want to be late for her date with Rory McKenna.</p><p>At six o'clock the following morning, a fishing boat found George Mellis's body pinned against the breakwater at the mouth of Penebscot Bay. The early news reports called it a drowning and accidental death, but as more information came in, the tenor of the stories began to change. From the coroner's office came reports that what at first had been thought to have been shark bites were actually stab wounds. The evening newspaper editions screamed: MURDER SUSPECTED IN GEORGE MELLIS MYSTERY DEATH...MILLIONAIRE FOUND STABBED TO DEATH.</p><p>Lieutenant Ingram was studying the tide charts for the previous evening. When he was finished, he leaned back in his chair, a perplexed expression on his face. George Mellis's body would have been swept out to sea had it not been caught against the breakwater. What puzzled the lieutenant was that the body had to have been carried by the tide from the direction of Dark Harbor. Where George Mellis was not supposed to have been.</p><p>Detective Nick Pappas flew up to Maine to have a talk with Lieutenant Ingram.</p><p>"I think my department might be of some help to you in this case," Nick said. "We have some interesting background information on George Mellis. I know this is out of our jurisdiction, but if you were to ask for our cooperation, we'd be happy to give it to you, Lieutenant."</p><p>In the twenty years Lieutenant Ingram had been with the Waldo County Sheriff's Department, the only real excitement he had seen was when a drunken tourist shot a moose head off the wall of a local curio shop. The George Mellis murder was front-page news, and Lieutenant Ingram sensed a chance to make a name for himself. With a little luck, it could lead to a job as a detective in the New York City Police Department, where the action was. And so now he looked at Nick Pappas and murmured, "I don't know..."</p><p>As though reading his mind, Nick Pappas said, "We're not looking for credit. There's gonna be a hell of a lot of pressure on this one, and it would make life easier for us if we could wrap it up fast. I could start by filling you in on George Mellis's background."</p><p>Lieutenant Ingram decided he had nothing to lose. "OK, you've got a deal."</p><p>Alexandra was in bed, heavily sedated. Her mind stubbornly refused to accept the fact that George had been murdered. How could he have been? There was no reason in the world for anyone to kill him. The police had talked of a knife wound, but they were wrong about that. It had to be some kind of accident. No one would want to kill him... No one would want to kill him... The opiate Dr. Harley gave her finally took hold. She slept.</p><p>Eve had been stunned at the news that George's body had been found. But perhaps it's a good thing, Eve thought. Alexandra will be the one under suspicion. She was there, on the island</p><p>Kate was seated next to Eve on the couch in the drawing room. The news had been a tremendous shock to Kate.</p><p>"Why would anyone want to murder George?" she asked.</p><p>Eve sighed. "I don't know, Gran. I just don't know. My heart breaks for poor Alex."</p><p>Lieutenant Philip Ingram was questioning the attendant on the Lincolnville-Islesboro ferry. "Are you positive neither Mr. or Mrs. Mellis came over on the ferry Friday afternoon?"</p><p>"They didn't come over on my shift, Phil, and I checked with the morning man, and he didn't see 'em neither. They had to have come in by plane."</p><p>"One more question, Lew. Did any strangers take the ferry across on Friday?"</p><p>"Hell," the attendant said, "you know we don't get no strangers goin' to the island this time of year. There might be a few tourists in the summer - but in November? She-e-e-it!"</p><p>Lieutenant Ingram went to talk to the manager of the Isles-boro airport. "George Mellis sure didn't fly in that evening, Phil. He musta come over to the island by ferry."</p><p>"Lew said he didn't see him."</p><p>"Well, hell, he couldn't a swum over, now could he?"</p><p>"What about Mrs. Mellis?"</p><p>"Yep. She come in here in her Beechcraft about ten o'clock. I had my son, Charley, run her over to Cedar Hill from the airport."</p><p>"What kind of mood did Mrs. Mellis seem to be in?"</p><p>"Funny you should ask. She was as nervous as spit on a hot kettle. Even my boy noticed it. Usually she's calm, always has a pleasant word for everybody. But that night she was in a tearin' hurry."</p><p>"One more question. Did any strangers fly in that afternoon or evening? Any unfamiliar faces?"</p><p>He shook his head. "Nope. Just the regulars."</p><p>An hour later, Lieutenant Ingram was on the phone talking to Nick Pappas. "What I've got so far," he told the New York detective, "is damned confusing. Friday night Mrs. Mellis arrived by private plane at the Islesboro airport around ten o'clock, but her husband wasn't with her, and he didn't come in by plane or ferry. In fact, there's nothin' to show he was on the island at all that night."</p><p>"Except the tide."</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"Whoever killed him probably threw him overboard from a boat, figuring the tide would carry him out to sea. Did you check the Corsair?"</p><p>"I looked it over. No sign of violence, no bloodstains."</p><p>"I'd like to bring a forensics expert up there. Would you mind?"</p><p>"Not as long as you remember our little deal."</p><p>"I'll remember. See you tomorrow."</p><p>Nick Pappas and a team of experts arrived the following morning. Lieutenant Ingram escorted them to the Blackwell dock, where the Corsair was tied up. Two hours later, the forensics expert said, "Looks like we hit the jackpot, Nick. There are some bloodstains on the underside of the lee rail."</p><p>That afternoon, the police laboratory verified that the stains matched George Mellis's blood type.</p><p>Manhattan's "silk stocking" police precinct was busier than usual. A series of all-night drug busts had filled the prisoners' cage to capacity, and the holding cells were crowded with prostitutes, drunks and sex offenders. The noise and the stench competed for Peter Templeton's attention, as he was escorted through the din to Lieutenant Detective Pappas's office.</p><p>"Hey, Peter. Nice of you to drop by."</p><p>On the phone Pappas had said, "You're holdin' out on me, chum. Be at my office before six o'clock, or I'll send a fuckin' SWAT team to bring you in."</p><p>When his escort left the office, Peter asked, "What's this all about, Nick? What's bothering you?"</p><p>"I'll tell you what's botherin' me. Someone's being clever. Do you know what we've got? A dead man who vanished from an island he never went to."</p><p>"That doesn't make sense."</p>       <amp-ad

          </amp-ad><p>"Tell me about it, pal. The ferryboat operator and the guy who runs the airport swear they never saw George Mellis on the night he disappeared. The only other way he could have gotten to Dark Harbor was by motorboat. We checked all the boat operators in the area. Zilch."</p><p>"Perhaps he wasn't at Dark Harbor that night."</p><p>"The forensic lab says different. They found evidence that Mellis was at the house and changed from a business suit into the sailing clothes he was wearin' when his body was found."</p><p>"Was he killed at the house?"</p><p>"On the Blackwell yacht. His body was dumped overboard. Whoever did it figured the current would carry the body to China."</p><p>"How did - ?"</p><p>Nick Pappas raised a beefy hand. "My turn. Mellis was your patient. He must have talked to you about his wife."</p><p>"What does she have to do with this?"</p><p>"Everything. She's my first, second and third choice."</p><p>"You're crazy."</p><p>"Hey, I thought shrinks never used words like crazy."</p><p>"Nick, what makes you think Alexandra Mellis killed her husband?"</p><p>"She was there, and she had a motive. She arrived at the island late that night with some cockamamy excuse about being delayed because she was waitin' at the wrong airport to meet her sister."</p><p>"What does her sister say?"</p><p>"Give me a break. What the hell would you expect her to say? They're twins. We know George Mellis was at the house that night, but his wife swears she never saw him. It's a big house, Peter, but it's not that big. Next, Mrs. M gave all the servants the weekend off. When I asked her why, she said it was George's idea. George's lips, of course, are sealed."</p><p>Peter sat there, deep in thought. "You said she had a motive. What?"</p><p>"You have a short memory span. You're the one who put me on the track. The lady was married to a psycho who got his kicks sexually abusing everything he could lay his fists on. He was probably slapping her around pretty good. Let's say she decided she didn't want to play anymore. She asked for a divorce. He wouldn't give it to her. Why should he? He had it made. She wouldn't dare take him to court - it would touch off too juicy a scandal. She had no choice. She had to kill him." He leaned back in his chair.</p><p>"What do you want from me?" Peter asked.</p><p>"Information. You had lunch with Mellis's wife ten days ago." He pressed the button on a tape recorder on the desk. "We're going on the record now, Peter. Tell me about that lunch. How did Alexandra Mellis behave? Was she tense? Angry? Hysterical?"</p><p>"Nick, I've never seen a more relaxed, happily married lady."</p><p>Nick Pappas glared at him and snapped off the tape recorder. "Don't shaft me, my friend. I went to see Dr. John Harley this morning. He's been giving Alexandra Mellis medication to stop her from committing suicide, for Christ's sake!"</p><p>Dr. John Harley had been greatly disturbed by his meeting with Lieutenant Pappas. The detective had gotten right to the point. "Has Mrs. Mellis consulted you professionally recently?"</p><p>"I'm sorry," Dr. Harley said. "I'm not at liberty to discuss my patients. I'm afraid I can't help you."</p><p>"All right, Doc. I understand. You're old friends. You'd like to keep the whole thing quiet. That's okay with me." He rose to his feet. "This is a homicide case. I'll be back in an hour with a warrant for your appointment records. When I find out what I want to know, I'm going to feed it to the newspapers."</p><p>Dr. Harley was studying him.</p><p>"We can handle it that way, or you can tell me now what I want to know, and I'll do what I can to keep it quiet. Well?"</p><p>"Sit down," Dr. Harley said. Nick Pappas sat. "Alexandra has been having some emotional problems lately."</p><p>"What kind of emotional problems?"</p><p>"She's been in a severe depression. She was talking about committing suicide."</p><p>"Did she mention using a knife?"</p><p>"No. She said she had a recurrent dream about drowning. I gave her Wellbutrin. She came back and told me it didn't seem to be helping, and I prescribed Nomifensine. I - I don't know whether it helped or not."</p><p>Nick Pappas sat there, putting things together in his mind. Finally he looked up. "Anything else?"</p><p>"That's everything, Lieutenant."</p><p>But there was more, and John Harley's conscience was bothering him. He had deliberately refrained from mentioning the brutal attack George Mellis had made on Eve Blackwell. Part of his concern was that he should have reported it to the police at the time it happened, but mainly Dr. Harley wanted to protect the Blackwell family. He had no way of knowing whether there was a connection between the attack on Eve and George Mellis's murder, but his instincts told him that it was better not to bring up the subject. He intended to do everything possible to protect Kate Blackwell.</p><p>Fifteen minutes after he made that decision, his nurse said, "Dr. Keith Webster is on line two, Doctor."</p><p>It was as if his conscience was prodding him.</p><p>Keith Webster said, "John, I'd like to stop by this afternoon and see you. Are you free?"</p><p>"I'll make myself free. What time?"</p><p>"How's five o'clock?"</p><p>"Fine, Keith. I'll see you then."</p><p>So, the matter was not going to be laid to rest so easily.</p><p>At five o'clock, Dr. Harley ushered Keith Webster into his office. "Would you like a drink?"</p><p>"No, thank you, John. I don't drink. Forgive me for barging in on you like this."</p><p>It seemed to John Harley that every time he saw him, Keith Webster was apologizing about something. He was such a mild, little man, so inoffensive and eager to please - a puppy waiting to be patted on the head. It was incredible to John Harley that within that pale, colorless persona there lurked such a brilliant surgeon.</p><p>"What can I do for you, Keith?"</p><p>Keith Webster drew a deep breath. "It's about that - you know - that beating George Mellis gave Eve Blackwell."</p><p>"What about it?"</p><p>"You're aware she almost died?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Well, it was never reported to the police. In view of what's happened - Mellis's murder and everything - I was wondering if maybe I shouldn't tell the police about it."</p><p>So there it was. There seemed no way to escape the problem.</p><p>"You have to do whatever you think best, Keith."</p><p>Keith Webster said gloomily, "I know. It's just that I'd hate to do anything that might hurt Eve Blackwell. She's a very special person."</p><p>Dr. Harley was watching him cautiously. "Yes, she is."</p><p>Keith Webster sighed. "The only thing is, John, if I do keep quiet about it now and the police find out later, it's going to look bad for me."</p><p>For both of us, John Harley thought. He saw a possible out. He said casually, "It's not very likely the police would find out, is it? Eve certainly would never mention it, and you fixed her up perfectly. Except for that little scar, you'd never know she'd been disfigured."</p><p>Keith Webster blinked. "What little scar?"</p><p>"The red scar on her forehead. She told me you said you were going to remove it in a month or two."</p><p>Dr. Webster was blinking faster now. It was some kind of nervous tic, Dr. Harley decided.</p><p>"I don't re - When did you last see Eve?"</p><p>"She came in about ten days ago to talk about a problem involving her sister. As a matter of fact, the scar was the only way I could tell it was Eve instead of Alexandra. They're identical twins, you know."</p><p>Keith Webster nodded slowly. "Yes. I've seen photographs of Eve's sister in the newspapers. There's an amazing likeness. And you say the only way you could tell them apart was by the scar on Eve's forehead from the operation I performed?"</p><p>"That's right."</p><p>Dr. Webster sat there, silent, chewing on his lower lip. Finally he said, "Perhaps I shouldn't go to the police just yet. I'd like to think about this a little more."</p><p>"Frankly, I think that's wise, Keith. They're both lovely young women. The newspapers are hinting that the police think Alexandra killed George. That's impossible. I remember when they were little girls..."</p><p>Dr. Webster was no longer listening.</p><p>When he left Dr. Harley, Keith Webster was lost in thought. He had certainly not left even the trace of a scar on that beautiful face. Yet, John Harley had seen it. It was possible that Eve could have gotten a scar afterward in another accident, but then why had she lied? It made no sense.</p><p>He examined it from every angle, going over all the different possibilities, and when he had come to a conclusion, he thought, If I'm right, this is going to change my whole life...</p><p>Early the following morning, Keith Webster called Dr. Harley. "John," he began, "excuse me for disturbing you. You said that Eve Blackwell came in to talk to you about her sister, Alexandra?"</p><p>"That's right."</p><p>"After Eve's visit, did Alexandra happen to come in to see you?"</p><p>"Yes. As a matter of fact, she came to my office the following day. Why?"</p><p>"Just curious. Can you tell me what Eve's sister came to see you about?"</p><p>"Alexandra was in a deep depression. Eve was trying to help her."</p><p>Eve had been beaten and almost killed by Alexandra's husband. And now the man had been murdered and it was Alexandra who was being blamed.</p><p>Keith Webster had always known he was not brilliant. In school he had had to work very hard in order to achieve barely passing grades. He was the perennial butt of his classmates' jokes. He was neither an athlete nor a scholar, and he was so-cially inept. He was as close as one could come to being a nonentity. No one was more surprised than his own family when Keith Webster was admitted to medical school. When he elected to become a surgeon, neither his peers nor his teachers expected him to become a competent one, let alone a great one. But he had surprised them all. There was a talent deep inside him that was nothing short of genius. He was like some exquisite sculptor working his magic with living flesh instead of clay, and in a short time Keith Webster's reputation spread. In spite of his success, however, he was never able to overcome the trauma of his childhood. Inside he was still the little boy who bored everyone, the one at whom the girls laughed.</p><p>When he finally reached Eve, Keith's hands were slippery with sweat. She answered the phone on the first ring. "Rory?" Her voice was low and sultry.</p><p>"No. This is Keith Webster."</p><p>"Oh. Hello."</p><p>He heard the change in her voice. "How've you been?" he asked.</p><p>"Fine."</p><p>He could sense her impatience. "I - I'd like to see you."</p><p>"I'm not seeing anyone. If you read the papers, you'll know my brother-in-law was murdered. I'm in mourning."</p><p>He wiped his hands on his trousers. "That's what I want to see you about, Eve. I have some information you should know about."</p><p>"What kind of information?"</p><p>"I would prefer not to discuss it on the telephone." He could almost hear Eve's mind working.</p><p>"Very well. When?"</p><p>"Now, if it's convenient."</p><p>When he arrived at Eve's apartment thirty minutes later, Eve opened the door for him. "I'm very busy. What did you want to see me about?"</p><p>"About this," Keith Webster said apologetically. He opened a manila envelope he was clutching, took out a photograph and diffidently handed it to Eve. It was a photograph of herself.</p><p>She looked at it, puzzled. "Well?"</p><p>"It's a picture of you."</p><p>"I can see that," she said curtly. "What about it?"</p><p>"It was taken after your operation."</p><p>"So?"</p><p>"There's no scar on your forehead, Eve."</p><p>He watched the change that came over her face.</p><p>"Sit down, Keith."</p><p>He sat opposite her, on the edge of the couch, and he could not keep from staring at her. He had seen many beautiful women in his practice, but Eve Blackwell totally bewitched him. He had never known anyone like her.</p><p>"I think you'd better tell me what this is all about."</p><p>He started at the beginning. He told her about his visit to Dr. Harley and about the mysterious scar, and as Keith Webster talked, he watched Eve's eyes. They were expressionless.</p><p>When Keith Webster finished, Eve said, "I don't know what you're thinking, but whatever it is, you're wasting my time. As for the scar, I was playing a little joke on my sister. It's as simple as that. Now, if you've quite finished, I have a great deal to do."</p><p>He remained seated. "I'm sorry to have bothered you. I just thought I should talk to you before I went to the police." He could see that he really had her attention now.</p><p>"Why on earth would you go to the police?"</p><p>"I'm obliged to report the attack George Mellis made on you. Then there's that business about you and the scar. I don't understand it, but I'm sure you can explain it to them."</p><p>Eve felt the first stab of fear. This stupid, dreary little man in front of her had no idea what had really happened, but he knew enough to start the police asking questions.</p><p>George Mellis had been a frequent visitor to the apartment. The police could probably find witnesses who had seen him. She had lied about being in Washington the night of George's murder. She had no real alibi. She had never thought she would need one. If the police learned that George had almost killed her, it would give them a motive. The whole scheme would begin to unravel. She had to silence this man.</p><p>"What is it you want? Money?"</p><p>"No!"</p><p>She saw the indignation on his face. "What, then?"</p><p>Dr. Webster looked down at the rug, his face red with embarrassment. "I - I like you so much, Eve. I would hate it if anything bad happened to you."</p><p>She forced a smile. "Nothing bad is going to happen to me, Keith. I haven't done anything wrong. Believe me, none of this has anything to do with George Mellis's murder." She reached out and took his hand. "I would really appreciate it very much if you would forget about this. All right?"</p><p>He covered her hand and squeezed it. "I'd like to, Eve. I really would. But they're holding the coroner's inquest Saturday. I'm a doctor. I'm afraid it's my duty to testify at that inquest and tell them everything I know."</p><p>He saw the alarm that appeared in her eyes.</p><p>"You don't have to do that!"</p><p>He stroked her hand. "Yes, I do, Eve. It's my sworn obligation. There's only one thing that could prevent me from doing it." He watched her leap to the bait of his words.</p><p>"What is that?"</p><p>His voice was very gentle. "A husband can't be forced to testify against his wife."</p> </div> </div> <div class="row turn-page"> <a class="col-xs-2" href="/Master%20of%20the%20Game/34.html?v=1662298277741">Previous</a> <a class="col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:center;" href="/Master%20of%20the%20Game/book.html?v=1662298277739">Table</a> <a class="col-xs-2 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:right;" href="/Master%20of%20the%20Game/36.html?v=1662298277742"> Next</a> </div> <hr></div><hr><footer class="container"> <p>© Company 2014</p></footer><amp-lightbox id="searchLightbox" class="-il" layout="nodisplay" on="lightboxOpen:searchInput.focus; lightboxClose:searchTriggerOpen.focus" scrollable="" hidden="hidden"> <div> <div class="-ic" role="button" tabindex="0" on="tap:searchLightbox.close"></div> <div class="-ih"> <div class="-sg -sb" on="tap: searchLightbox.close, AMP.setState({ query: '' }), searchForm.clear" role="button" tabindex="0"> <div class="ap-a-ico -sw"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#close"></use> </svg> </div> </div> <div class="ap-o-search-field"> <form action="#" action-xhr="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/echo" class="-ip" id="searchForm" on="submit:AMP.setState({ query: throttledValue }),searchResult.focus" target="_top"> <amp-autocomplete class="-id" filter="substring" min-characters="1" on="select:AMP.setState({ query: event.value })" submit-on-enter="false" src="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/autosuggest"> <div class="ap-a-ico -im"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#search"></use> </svg> </div> <input id="searchInput" class="-iv" name="q" placeholder="What are you looking for?" on="input-throttled:AMP.setState({ throttledValue: event.value })" required=""> <button class="-ig" type="submit" name="search-submit" disabled="" [disabled]="!throttledValue">Search </button> <div role="listbox"></div> </amp-autocomplete> </form> <div class="empty" [class]="query ?
