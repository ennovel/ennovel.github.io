<br> ? NEIL ARMSTRONG, July 20, 1969
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> DAYS, pale slices between nights, they blend, not exactly alike, transparencies so lightly tinted that only stacked all together do they darken to a fatal shade. One Saturday in August Buchanan approaches Rabbit during the coffee break. They are part of the half?crew working the half?day; hence perhaps this intimacy. The Negro wipes from his lips the moisture of the morning whisky enjoyed outside in the sunshine of the loading platform, and asks, "How're they treatin' you, Harry?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "They?" Harry has known the other man by sight and name for years but still is not quite easy, talking to a black; there always seems to be some joke involved, that he doesn't quite get.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "The world, man."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not bad."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan stands there blinking, studying, jiggling up and down on his feet engagingly. Hard to tell how old they are. He might be thirty?five, he might be sixty. On his upper lip he wears the smallest possible black mustache, smaller than a type brush. His color is ashy, without any shine to it, whereas the other shop Negro, Farnsworth, looks shoe?polished and twinkles among the printing machinery, under the steady shadowless light. "But not good, huh?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'm not sleeping so good," Rabbit does confess. He has an itch, these days, to confess, to spill, he is so much alone.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Your old lady still shackin' up across town?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Everybody knows. Niggers, coolies, derelicts, morons. Numbers writers, bus conductors, beauty shop operators, the entire brick city of Brewer. VERITY EMPLOYEE NAMED CUCKOLD OF WEEK. Angstrom Accepts Official Hornsfrom Mayor. "I'm living alone," Harry admits, adding, "with the kid."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How about that," Buchanan says, lightly rocking. "How about that?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit says weakly, "Until things straighten out."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Gettin' any tail?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry must look startled, for Buchanan hastens to explain, "Man has to have tail. Where's your dad these days?" The ques-tion flows from the assertion immediately, though it doesn't seem to follow.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit says, puzzled, offended, but because Buchanan is a Negro not knowing how to evade him, "He's taking two weeks off so he can drive my mother back and forth to the hospital for some tests."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Years." Buchanan mulls, the two pushed?out cushions of his mouth appearing to commune with each other through a hum; then a new thought darts out through them, making his mustache jig. "Your dad is a real pal to you, that's a wonderful thing. That is a truly wonderful thing. I never had a dad like that, I knew who the man was, he was around town, but he was never my dad in the sense your dad is your dad. He was never my pal like that."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry hangs uncertainly, not knowing if he should commiser-ate or laugh. "Well," he decides to confess, "he's sort of a pal, and sort of a pain in the neck."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan likes the remark, even though he goes through pep-pery motions of rejecting it. "Oh, never say that now. You just be grateful you have a dad that cares. You don't know, man, how lucky you have it. Just 'cause your wife's gettin' her ass looked after elsewhere don't mean the whole world is come to some bad end. You should be havin' your tail, is all. You're a big fella. "
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Distaste and excitement contend in Harry; he feels tall and pale beside Buchanan, and feminine, a tingling target of fun and ten-derness and avarice mixed. Talking to Negroes makes him feel itchy, up behind the eyeballs, maybe because theirs look so semi-liquid and yellow in the white and sore. Their whole beings seem lubricated in pain. "I'll manage," he says reluctantly, thinking of Peggy Fosnacht.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The end?of?break bell rings. Buchanan snaps his shoulders into a hunch and out of it as if rendering a verdict. "How about it, Harry, steppin' out with some of the boys tonight," he says. "Come on into Jimbo's Lounge around nine, ten, see what dev-elops. Maybe nothin'. Maybe sumpthin'. You're just turnin' old, the way you're goin' now. Old and fat and finicky, and that's no way for a nice big man to go." He sees that Rabbit's instincts are to refuse; he holds up a quick palm the color of silver polish and says, "Think about it. I like you, man. If you don't show, you don't show. No sweat."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> All Saturday the invitation hums in his ears. Something in what Buchanan said. He was lying down to die, had been lying down 'for years. His body had been telling him to. His eyes blur print in the afternoons, no urge to run walking even that stretch of tempt-ing curved sidewalk home, has to fight sleep before supper and then can't get under at night, can't even get it up to jerk off to relax himself. Awake with the first light every morning regardless, another day scraping his eyes. Without going much of anywhere in his life he has somehow seen everything too often. Trees, weather, the molding trim drying its cracks wider around the front door, he notices every day going out, house made of green wood. No belief in an afterlife, no hope for it, too much more ofthe same thing, already it seems he's lived twice. When he came back to Janice that began the second time for him; poor kid is having her first time now. Bless that dope. At least she had the drive to get out. Women, fire in their crotch, won't burn out, begin by fight-ing off pricks, end by going wild hunting for one that still works.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Once last week he called the lot to find out if she and Stavros were reporting for work or just screwing around the clock. Mildred Kroust answered, she put him on to Janice, who whis-pered, "Harry, Daddy doesn't know about us, don't ever call me here, I'll call you back." And she had called him late that after-noon, at the house, Nelson in the other room watching Gilligan's Island, and said cool as you please, he hardly knew her voice, "Harry, I'm sorry for whatever pain this is causing you, truly sorry, but it's very important that at this point in our lives we don't let guilt feelings motivate us. I'm trying to look honestly into myself, to see who I am, and where I should be going. I want us both, Harry, to come to a decision we can live with. It's the year nine-teen sixty?nine and there's no reason for two mature people to smother each other to death simply out of inertia. I'm searching for a valid identity and I suggest you do the same." After some more of this, she hung up. Her vocabulary had expanded, maybe she was watching a lot of psychiatric talk shows. The sinners shall be justified. Screw her. Dear Lord, screw her. He is thinking this on the bus.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He thinks, Screw her, and at home has a beer and takes a bath and puts on his good summer suit, a light gray sharkskin, and gets Nelson's pajamas out of the dryer and his toothbrush out of the bathroom. The kid and Billy have arranged for him to spend the night. Harry calls up Peggy to check it out. "Oh absolutely," she says, "I'm not going anywhere, why don't you stay and have dinner?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I can't I don't think."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why not? Something else to do?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Sort of." He and the kid go over around six, on an empty bus. Already at this hour Weiser has that weekend up?tempo, cars hurrying faster home to get out again, a very fat man with orange hair standing under an awning savoring a cigar as if angels will shortly descend, an expectant shimmer on the shut storefronts, girls clicking along with heads big as rose?bushes, curlers wrapped in a kerchief. Saturday night. Peggy meets him at the door with an offer of a drink. She and Billy live in an apartment in one of the new eight?story buildings in West Brewer overlooking the river, where there used to be a harness racetrack. From her living room she has a panorama of Brewer, the concrete eagle on the skyscraper Court House flaring his wings above the back of the Owl Pretzels sign. Beyond the flowerpot?red city Mt. Judge hangs smoky?green, one side gashed by a gravel pit like a roast begin-ning to be carved. The river coal black.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Maybe just one. I gotta go somewhere."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You said that. What kind of drink?" She is wearing a clingy palish?purple sort of Paisley mini that shows a lot of heavy leg. One thing Janice always had, was nifty legs. Peggy has a pasty helpless look of white meat behind the knees.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You have Daiquiri mix?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't know, Ollie used to keep things like that, but when we moved I think it all stayed with him." She and Ollie Fosnacht had lived in an asbestos?shingled semi?detached some blocks away, not far from the county mental hospital. Ollie lives in the city now, near his music store, and she and the kid have this apart-ment, with Ollie in their view if they can find him. She is rum-maging in a low cabinet below some empty bookcases. "I can't see any, it comes in envelopes. How about gin and something?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You have bitter lemon?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> More rummaging. "No, just some tonic."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Good enough. Want me to make it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "If you like." She stands up, heavy?legged, lightly sweating, relieved. Knowing he was coming, Peggy had decided against sunglasses, a sign of trust to leave them off. Her walleyes are naked to him, her face has this helpless look, turned full toward him while both eyes seem fascinated by something in the corners of the ceiling. He knows only one eye is bad but he never can bring him-self to figure out which. And all around her eyes this net of white wrinkles the sunglasses usually conceal.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He asks her, "What for you?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, anything. The same thing. I drink everything."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> While he is cracking an ice tray in the tiny kitchenette, the two boys have snuck out of Billy's bedroom. Rabbit wonders if they have been looking at dirty photographs. The kind of pictures kids used to have to pay an old cripple on Plum Street a dollar apiece for you can buy a whole magazine full of now for seventy?five cents, right downtown. The Supreme Court, old men letting the roof cave in. Billy is a head taller than Nelson, sunburned where Nelson takes a tan after his mother, both of them with hair down over their ears, the Fosnacht boy's blonder and curlier. "Mom, we want to go downstairs and run the mini?bike on the parking lot."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Come back up in an hour," Peggy tells them, "I'll give you supper."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nelson had a peanut?butter sandwich before we left," Rabbit explains.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Typical male cooking," Peggy says. "Where're you going this evening anyway, all dressed up in a suit?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nowhere much. I told a guy I might meet him." He doesn't say it is a Negro. He should be asking her out, is his sudden frightened feeling. She is dressed to go out; but not so dolled?up it can't appear she plans to stay home tonight. He hands her her g.?and?t. The best defense is to be offensive. "You don't have any mint or limes or anything."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Her plucked eyebrows lift. "No, there are lemons in the fridge, is all. I could run down to the grocery for you." Not entirely ironical: using his complaint to weave coziness.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit laughs to retract. "Forget it, I'm just used to bars, where they have everything. At home all I ever do is drink beer."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She laughs in answer. She is tense as a schoolteacher facing her first class. To relax them both he sits down in a loose leather armchair that says pfsshhu. "Hey, this is nice," he announces, meaning the vista, but he spoke too early, for from this low chair the view is flung out of sight and becomes all sky: a thin bright wash, stripes like fat in bacon.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You should hear Ollie complain about the rent." Peggy sits down not in another chair but on the flat grille where the radiator breathes beneath the window, opposite and above him, so he sees a lot of her legs ? shiny skin stuffed to the point of shapelessness. Still, she is showing him what she has, right up to the triangle of underpants, which is one more benefit of being alive in 1969. Miniskirts and those magazines: well, hell, we've always known women had crotches, why not make it legal? A guy at the shop brought in a magazine that, honestly, was all cunts, in blurred bad four?color but cunts, upside down, backwards, the girls attached to them rolling their tongues in their mouths and fanning their hands on their bellies and otherwise trying to hide how silly they felt. Homely things, really, cunts. Without the Supreme Court that might never have been made clear.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hey, how is old Ollie?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Peggy shrugs. "He calls. Usually to cancel his Sunday with Billy. You know he never was the family man you are."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit is surprised to be called that. He is getting too tame. He asks her, "How does he spend his time?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh," Peggy says, and awkwardly turns her body so Rabbit sees pricked out in windowlight the tonic bubbles in her drink, which is surprisingly near drunk, "he rattles around Brewer with a bunch of creeps. Musicians, mostly. They go to Philadelphia a lot, and New York. Last winter he went skiing at Aspen and told me all about it, including the girls. He came back so brown in the face, I cried for days. I could never get him outdoors, when we had the place over on Franklin Street. How do you spend your time?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I work. I mope around the house with the kid. We look at the boob tube and play catch in the back yard."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Do you mope for her, Harry?" With a clumsy shrug of her hip the woman moves off her radiator perch, her walleyes staring to either side of him so he thinks he is her target and flinches. ?But she floats past him and, clattering, refills her drink. "Want another?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No thanks, I'm still working on this one. I gotta go in a minute."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "So soon," she croons unseen, as if remembering the beginning of a song in her tiny kitchenette. From far below their windows arises the razzing, coughing sound of the boys on the mini?bike. The noise swoops and swirls, a rude buzzard. Beyond it across the river hangs the murmur of Brewer traffic, constant like the sea; an occasional car toots, a wink of phosphorescence. From the kitchenette, as if she had been baking the thought in the oven, Peggy calls, "She's not worth it." Then her body is at his back, her voice upon his head. "I didn't know," she says, "you loved her so much. I don't think Janice knew it either."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well, you get used to somebody. Anyway, it's an insult. With a wop like that. You should hear him run down the U.S. government." ,
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Harry, you know what I think. I'm sure you know what I think."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He doesn't. He has no idea. She seems to think he's been reading thoughts printed on her underpants.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I think she's treated you horribly. The last time we had lunch together, I told her so. I said, 'Janice, your attempts to justify yourself do not impress me. You've left a man who came back to you when you needed him, and you've left your son at a point in his development when it's immensely important to have a stable home setting.' I said that right to her face."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Actually the kid goes over to the lot pretty much and sees her there. She and Stavros take him out to eat. In a way it's like he gained an uncle."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You're so forgiving, Harry! Ollie would have strangled me; he's still immensely jealous. He's always asking me who my boyfriends are."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He doubts she has any, and sips his drink. Although in this county women with big bottoms usually don't go begging. Dutchmen love bulk. He says, "Well, I don't know if I did such a great job with Janice. She has to live too."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well Harry, if that's your reasoning, we all have to live." And from the way she stands there in front of him, if he sat up straight her pussy would be exactly at his nose. Hair tickles: he might sneeze. He sips the drink again, and feels the tasteless fluid expand his inner space. He might sit up at any minute, if she doesn't watch out. From the hair on her head probably a thick springy bush, though you can't always tell, some of the cunts in the magazine just had wisps at the base of their bellies, hardly an armpit's worth. Dolls. She moves away saying, "Who'll hold families together, if everybody has to live? Living is a compromise, between doing what you want and doing what other people want."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What about what poor old God wants?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The uncalled?for noun jars her from the seductive pose she has assumed, facing out the window, her backside turned to him. The dog position. Tip her over a chair and let her fuss herself with her fingers into coming while he does it from behind. Janice got so she preferred it, more animal, she wasn't distracted by the look on his face, never was one for wet kisses, when they first started going together complained she couldn't breathe, he asked her if she had adenoids. Seriously. No two alike, a billion cunts in the world, snowflakes. Touch them right they melt. What we most protect is where we want to be invaded. Peggy leaves her drink on the sill like a tall jewel and turns to him with her deformed face open. Since the word has been sprung on her, she asks, "Don't you think God is people?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No, I think God is everything that isn't people. I guess I think that. I don't think enough to know what I think." In irritation, he stands.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Big against the window, a hot shadow, palish?purple edges catching the light ebbing from the red city, the dim mountain, Peggy exclaims. "Oh, you think with" ? and to assist her awkward thought she draws his shape in the air with two hands, having freed them for this gesture ?"your whole person."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She looks so helpless and vague there seems nothing for Harry to do but step into the outline of himself she has drawn and kiss her. Her face, eclipsed, feels large and cool. Her lips bumble on his, the spongy wax of gumdrops, yet narcotic, not quite tasteless: as a kid Rabbit loved bland candy like Dots; sitting in the movies he used to plow through three nickel boxes of them, playing with them with his tongue and teeth, playing, playing before giving himself the ecstasy of the bite. Up and down his length she bumps against him, straining against his height, touching. The strange place on her where nothing is, the strange place higher where some things are. Her haunches knot with the effort of keeping on tiptoe. She pushes, pushes: he is a cunt this one?eyed woman is coldly pushing up into. He feels her mind gutter out; she has wrapped them in a clumsy large ball of darkness.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Something scratches on the ball. A key in a lock. Then the door knocks. Harry and Peggy push apart, she tucks her hair back around her spread?legged eyes and runs heavily to the door and lets in the boys. They are red?faced and furious. "Mom, the fucking thing broke down again," Billy tells his mother. Nelson looks over at Harry. The boy is near tears. Since Janice left, he is silent and delicate: an eggshell full of tears.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It wasn't my fault," he calls huskily, injustice a sieve in his throat. "Dad, he says it was my fault."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You baby, I didn't say that exactly."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You did. He did, Dad, and it wasn't."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "All I said was he spun out too fast. He always spins out too fast. He flipped on a loose stone, now the headlight is bent under and it won't start."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "If it wasn't such a cheap one it wouldn't break all the time."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's not a cheap one it's the best one there is almost and anyway you don't even have any -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I wouldn't take one if you gave it to me -'
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "So who are you to talk."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hey, easy, easy," Harry says. "We'll get it fixed. I'll pay for it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't pay for it, Dad. It wasn't anybody's fault. It's just he's so spoiled."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You shrimp," Billy says, and hits him, much the same way that three weeks ago Harry hit Janice, hard but seeking a spot that could take it. Harry separates them, squeezing Billy's arm so the kid clams up. This kid is going to be tough some day. Already his arm is stringy.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Peggy is just bringing it all into focus, her insides shifting back from that kiss. "Billy, these things will happen ifyou insist on playing so dangerously." To Harry she says, "Damn Ollie for getting it for him, I think he did it to spite me. He knows I hate machines."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry decides Billy is the one to talk to. "Hey. Billy. Shall I take Nelson back home, or do you want him to spend the night anyway?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> And both boys set up a wailing for Nelson to spend the night. "Dad you don't have to come for me or anything, I'll ride my bike home in the morning first thing, I left it here yesterday."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> So Rabbit releases Billy's arm and gives Nelson a kiss somewhere around the ear and tries to find the right eye of Peggy's to look into. "Okey?doak. I'll be off."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She says, "Must you? Stay. Can't I give you supper? Another drink? It's early yet."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "This guy's waiting," Rabbit lies, and makes it around her furniture to the door.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Her body chases him. Her vague eyes shine in their tissuepaper sockets, and her lips have that loosened look kissed lips get; he resists the greedy urge to buy another box of Dots. "Harry," she begins, and seems to fall toward him, after a stumble, though they don't touch.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'm usually here. If?you know."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I know. Thanks for the g.?and?t. Your view is great." He reaches then and pats, not her ass exactly, the flank at the side of it, too broad, too firm, alive enough under his palm, it turns out, to make him wonder, when her door closes, why he is going down the elevator, and out.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> It is too early to meet Buchanan. He walks back through the West Brewer side streets toward Weiser, through the dulling summer light and the sounds of distant games, of dishes rattled in kitchen sinks, of television muffled to a murmur mechanically laced with laughter and applause, of cars driven by teenagers laying rubber and shifting down. Children and old men sit on the porch steps beside the lead?colored milk?bottle boxes. Some stretches of sidewalk are brick; these neighborhoods, the oldest in West Brewer, close to the river, are cramped, gentle, barren. Between the trees there is a rigid flourishing of hydrants, meters, and signs, some of them ? virtual billboards in white on green directing motorists to superhighways whose number is blazoned on the federal shield or on the commonwealth keystone; from these obscure West Brewer byways, sidewalks and asphalt streets rumpled comfortably as old clothes, one can be arrowed toward Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington the national capital, New York the headquarters of commerce and fashion. Or in the other direction can find Pittsburgh and Chicago. But beneath these awesome metal insignia of vastness and motion fat men in undershirts loiter, old ladies move between patches of gossip with the rural waddle of egg?gatherers, dogs sleep curled beside the cooling curb, and children with hockey sticks and tape?handled bats diffidently chip at whiffle balls and wads of leather, whittling themselves into the next generation of athletes and astronauts. Rabbit's eyes sting in the dusk, in this smoke of his essence, these harmless neighborhoods that have gone to seed. So much love, too much love, it is our madness, it is rotting us out, exploding us like dandelion polls. He stops at a corner grocery for a candy bar, an Oh Henry, then at the Burger Bliss on Weiser, dazzling in its lake of parking space, for a Lunar Special (double cheeseburger with an American flag stuck into the bun) and a vanilla milkshake, that tastes toward the bottom of chemical sludge.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The interior of Burger Bliss is so bright that his fingernails, with their big mauve moons, gleam and the coins he puts down in payment seem cartwheels of metal. Beyond the lake of light, unfriendly darkness. He ventures out past a dimmed drive?in bank and crosses the bridge. High slender arc lamps on giant flower stems send down a sublunar light by which the hurrying cars all appear purple. There are no other faces but his on the bridge. From the middle, Brewer seems a web, to which glowing droplets adhere. Mt. Judge is one with the night. The luminous smudge of the Pinnacle Hotel hangs like a star.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Gnats bred by the water brush Rabbit's face; Janice's desertion nags him from within, a sore spot in his stomach. Ease off beer and coffee. Alone, he must take care of himself. Sleeping alone, he dreads the bed, watches the late shows, Carson, Griffin, cocky guys with nothing to sell but their brass. Making millions on sheer gall. American dream: when he first heard the phrase as a kid he pictured God lying sleeping, the quilt?colored map of the U.S. coming out of his head like a cloud. Peggy's embrace drags at his limbs. Suit feels sticky. Jimbo's Friendly Lounge is right off the Brewer end of the bridge, a half?block down from Plum. Inside it, all the people are black.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Black to him is just a political word but these people really are, their faces shine of blackness turning as he enters, a large soft white man in a sticky gray suit. Fear travels up and down his skin, but the music of the great green?and?mauve?glowing jukebox called Moonmood slides on, and the liquid of laughter and tickled muttering resumes flowing; his entrance was merely a snag. Rabbit hangs like a balloon waiting for a dart; then his elbow is jostled and Buchanan is beside him.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hey, man, you made it." The Negro has materialized from the smoke. His overtrimmed mustache looks wicked in here.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You didn't think I would?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Doubted it," Buchanan says. "Doubted it severely."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It was your idea."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Right. Harry, you are right. I'm not arguing, I am rejoicing. Let's fix you up. You need a drink, right?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't know, my stomach's getting kind of sensitive."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You need two drinks. Tell me your poison."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Maybe a Daiquiri?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Never. That is a lady's drink for salad luncheons. Rufe, you old rascal."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yazzuh, yazzuh," comes the answer from the bar.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Do a Stinger for the man."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yaz?zuh."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rufe has a bald head like one of the stone hatchets in the Brewer Museum, only better polished. He bows into the marine underglow of the bar and Buchanan leads Rabbit to a booth in the back. The place is deep and more complicated than it appears from the outside. Booths recede and lurk: darkwood cape?shapes. Along one wall, Rufe and the lowlit bar; behind and above it, not only the usual Pabst and Bud and Miller's gimcracks bobbing and shimmering, but two stuffed small deer?heads, staring with bright brown eyes that will never blink. Gazelles, could they have been gazelles? A space away, toward a wall but with enough room for a row of booths behind, a baby grand piano, painted silver with .one ofthose spray cans, silver in circular swirls. In a room obliquely off the main room, a pool table: colored boys all arms and legs spidering around the idyllic green felt. The presence of any game reassures Rabbit. Where any game is being played a hedge exists against fury. "Come meet some soul," Buchanan says. Two shadows in the booth are a man and a woman. The man wears silver circular glasses and a little pussy of a goatee and is young. The woman is old and wrinkled and smokes a yellow cigarette that requires much sucking in and holding down and closing of the eyes and sighing. Her brown eyelids are gray, painted blue. Sweat shines below the base of her throat, on the slant bone between her breasts, as if she had breasts, which she does not, though her dress, the blood?color of a rooster's comb, is cut deep, as if she did. Before they are introduced she says "Hi" to Harry, but her eyes slit to pin him fast in the sliding of a dream.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "This man," Buchanan is announcing, "is a co?worker of mine, he works right beside his daddy at Ver?i?ty Press, an expert Linotypist," giving syllables an odd ticking equality, a put?on or signal of some sort? "But not only that. He is an ath?e?lete of renown, a basketball player bar none, the Big O of Brewer in his day."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Very beautiful," the other dark man says. Round specs tilt, glint. The shadow of a face they cling to feels thin in the darkness. The voice arises very definite and dry.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Many years ago," Rabbit says, apologizing for his bulk, his bloated pallor, his dead fame. He sits down in the booth to hide.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He has the hands," the woman states. She is in a trance. She says, "Give old Babe one of those hands, white boy." A?prickle with nervousness, wanting to sneeze on the sweetish smoke, Rabbit lifts his right hand up from his lap and lays it on the slippery table. Innocent meat. Distorted paw. Reminds him of, on television, that show with chimpanzees synchronized with talk and music, the eerie look of having just missed the winning design.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The woman touches it. Her touch reptilian cool. Her eyes lift, brooding. Above the glistening bone her throat drips jewels, a napkin of rhinestones or maybe real diamonds; Cadillacs after all, alligator shoes, they can't put their money into real estate like whites; Springer's thrifty Toyotas not to the point. His mind is racing with his pulse. She has a silver sequin pasted beside one eye. Accent the ugly until it becomes gorgeous. Her eyelashes are great false crescents. That she has taken such care of herself leads him to suspect she will not harm him. His pulse slows. Her touch slithers nice as a snake. "Do dig that thumb," she advises the air. She caresses his thumb's curve. Its thin?skinned veined ball. Its colorless moon nail. "That thumb means sweetness and light. It is an indicator of pleasure in Sagittarius and Leo." She gives one knuckle an affectionate pinch.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The Negro not Buchanan (Buchanan has hustled to the bar to check on the Stinger) says, "Not like one of them usual little sawed?off nuggers these devils come at you with, right?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Babe answers, not yielding her trance, "No, sir. This thumb here is extremely plausible. Under the right signs it would absolutely function. Now these knuckles here, they aren't so good, I don't get much music out of these knuckles." And she presses a chord on them, with fingers startlingly hard and certain. "But this here thumb," she goes back to caressing it, "is a real enough heartbreaker."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "All these Charlies is heartbreakers, right? Just cause they don't know how to shake their butterball asses don't mean they don't get Number One in, they gets it in real mean, right? The reason they so mean, they has so much religion, right? That big white God go tells 'em, Screw that black chick, and they really wangs away 'cause God's right there slappin' away at their butterball asses. Cracker spelled backwards is fucker, right?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit wonders if this is how the young Negro really talks, wonders if there is a real way. He does not move, does not even bring back his hand from the woman's inspection, her touches chill as teeth. He is among panthers.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan, that old rascal, bustles back and sets before Rabbit a tall pale glass of poison and shoves in so Rabbit has to shove over opposite the other man. Buchanan's eyes check around the faces and guess it's gotten heavy. Lightly he says, "This man's wife, you know what? That woman, I never had the pleasure of meeting her, not counting those Verity picnics where Farnsworth, you all know Farnsworth now ? ?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Like a father," the young man says, adding, "Right?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> " ? gets me so bombed out of my mind on that barrel beer I can't remember anybody by face or name, where was I? Yes, that woman, she just upped and left him the other week, left him flat to go chasing around with some other gentleman, something like an I?talian, didn't you say Harry?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "A Greek."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Babe clucks. "Honey, now what did he have you didn't? He must of had a thumb long as this badmouth's tongue." She nudges her companion, who retrieves from his lips this shared cigarette, which has grown so short it must burn, and sticks out his tongue. Its whiteness shocks Rabbit; a mouthful of luminous flesh. Though fat and pale, it does not look very long. This man, Rabbit sees, is a boy; the patch of goatee is all he can grow. Harry does not like him. He likes Babe, he thinks, even though she has dried hard, a prune on the bottom of the box. In here they are all on the bottom of the box. This drink, and his hand, are the whitest thing around. Not to think of the other's tongue. He sips. Too sweet, wicked. A thin headache promptly begins.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan is persisting, "Don't seem right to me, healthy big man living alone with nobody now to comfort him."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The goatee bobs. "Doesn't bother me in the slightest. Gives the man time to think, right? Gets the thought of cunt off his back, right? Chances are he has some hobby he can do, you know, like woodwork." He explains to Babe, "You know, like a lot of these peckerwoods have this clever thing they can do down in their basements, like stamp collecting, right? That's how they keep making it big. Cleverness, right?" He taps his skull, whose narrowness is padded by maybe an inch of tight black wool. The texture reminds Rabbit of his mother's crocheting, if she had used tiny metal thread. Her blue bent hands now helpless. Even in here, family sadness pokes at him, probing sore holes.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I used to collect baseball cards," he tells them. He hopes to excite enough rudeness from them so he can leave. He remembers the cards' bubble?gum smell, their silken feel from the powdered sugar. He sips the Stinger.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Babe sees him make a face. "You don't have to drink that piss." She nudges her neighbor again. "Let's have one more stick."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Woman, you must think I'm made of hay."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I know you're plenty magical, that's one thing. Off that uptight shit, the ofay here needs a lift and I'm nowhere near spaced enough to pee?form."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Last drag," he says, and passes her the tiny wet butt.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She crushes it into the Sunflower Beer ashtray. "This roach is hereby dead." And holds her thin hand palm up for a hit.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan is clucking. "Mother?love, go easy on yourself," he tells Babe.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The other Negro is lighting another cigarette; the paper is twisted at the end and flares, subsides. He passes it to her saying, "Waste is a sin, right?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hush now. This honeyman needs to loosen up, I hate to see 'em sad, I always have, they aren't like us, they don't have the insides to accommodate it. They's like little babies that way, they passes it off to someone else." She is offering Rabbit the cigarette, moist end toward him.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He says, "No thanks, I gave up smoking ten years ago."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan chuckles, with thumb and forefinger smooths his mustache sharper.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The boy says, "They're going to live forever, right?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Babe says, "This ain't any of that nicotine shit. This weed is kindness itself."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> While Babe is coaxing him, Buchanan and the boy diagonally discuss his immortality. "My daddy used to say, Down home, you never did see a dead white man, any more'n you'd see a dead mule."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "God's on their side, right? God's white, right? He doesn't want no more Charlies up there to cut into his take, he has it just fine the way it is, him and all those black angels out in the cotton."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Your mouth's gonta hurt you, boy. The man is the lay of the land down here."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Whose black ass you hustling, hers or yours?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You just keep your smack in the heel of your shoe."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Babe is saying, "You suck it in as far as it'll go and hold it down as long as you absolutely can. It needs to mix with you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit tries to comply, but coughing undoes every puff. Also he is afraid of getting "hooked," of being suddenly jabbed with a needle, of starting to hallucinate because of something dropped into his Stinger. AUTOPSY ORDERED IN FRIENDLY LOUNGE DEATH. Coroner Notes Atypical Color of Skin.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Watching him cough, the boy says, "He is beautiful. I didn't know they still came with all those corners. Right out of the crackerbox, right?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> This angers Rabbit enough to keep a drag down. It burns his throat and turns his stomach. He exhales with the relief of vomiting and waits for something to happen. Nothing. He sips the Stinger but now it tastes chemical like the bottom of that milkshake. He wonders how he can get out of here. Is Peggy's offer still open? Just to feel the muggy kiss of summer night on the Brewer streets would be welcome. Nothing feels worse than other people's good times.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Babe asks Buchanan, "What'd you have in mind, Buck?" She is working on the joint now and the smoke includes her eyes.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The fat man's shrug jiggles Rabbit's side. "No big plans," Buchanan mutters. "See what develops. Woman, way you're goin', you won't be able to tell those black keys from the white."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She plumes smoke into his face. "Who owns who?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The boy cuts in. "Ofay doesn't dig he's a john, right?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan, his smoothness jammed, observes, "That mouth again."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit asks loudly, "What else shall we talk about?" and twiddles his fingers at Babe for the joint. Inhaling still burns, but something is starting to mesh. He feels his height above the others as a good, a lordly, thing.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan is probing the other two. "Jill in tonight?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Babe says, "Left her back at the place."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The boy asks, "On a nod, right?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You stay away, hear, she got herself clean. She's on no nod, just tired from mental confusion, from fighting her signs."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Clean," the boy says, "what's clean? White is clean, right? Cunt is clean, right? Shit is clean, right? There's nothin' not clean the law don't go pointing its finger at it, right?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Wrong," Babe says. "Hate is not clean. A boy like you with hate in his heart, he needs to wash."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Wash is what they said to Jesus, right?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Who's Jill?" Rabbit asks.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Wash is what Pilate said he thought he might go do, right? Don't go saying clean to me, Babe, that's one darkie bag they had us in too long."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan is still delicately prying at Babe. "She coming in?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The other cuts in, "She'll be in, can't keep that cunt away; put locks on the doors, she'll ooze in the letter slot."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Babe turns to him in mild surprise. "Now you loves little Jill."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You can love what you don't like, right?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Babe hangs her head. "That poor baby," she tells the tabletop, "just going to hurt herself and anybody standing near."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan speaks slowly, threading his way. "Just thought, man might like to meet Jill."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The boy sits up. Electricity, reflected from the bar and the streets, spins around his spectacle rims. "Gonna match 'em up," he says, "you're gonna cut yourself in on an all?honky fuck. You can out?devil these devils any day, right? You could of outniggered Moses on the hill."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He seems to be a static the other two put up with. Buchanan is still prying at Babe across the table. "Just thought," he shrugs, "two birds with one stone."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> A tear falls from her creased face to the tabletop. Her hair is done tight back like a schoolgirl's, a red ribbon in back. It must hurt, with kinky hair. "Going to take herself down all the way, it's in her signs, can't slip your signs."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Who's that voodoo supposed to boogaboo?" the boy asks. "Whitey here got so much science he don't even need to play the numbers, right?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit asks, "Is Jill white?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The boy tells the two others angrily, "Cut the crooning, she'll be here, Christ, where else would she go, right? We're the blood to wash her sins away, right? Clean. Shit, that burns me. There's no dirt made that cunt won't swallow. With a smile on her face, right? Because she's clean." There seems to be not only a history but a religion behind his anger. Rabbit sees this much, that the other two are working to fix him up with this approaching cloud, this Jill, who will be pale like the Stinger, and poisonous.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He announces, "I think I'll go soon."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan swiftly squeezes his forearm. "What you want to do that for, Br'er Rabbit? You haven't achieved your objective, friend."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "My only objective was to be polite." She'll ooze in the letter slot: haunted by this image and the smoke inside him, he feels he can lift up from the booth, pass across Buchanan's shoulders like a shawl, and out the door. Nothing can hold him, not Mom, not Janice. He could slip a posse dribbling, Tothero used to flatter him.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You going to go off half?cocked," Buchanan warns.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You ain't heard Babe play," the other man says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He stops rising. "Babe plays?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She is flustered, stares at her thin ringless hands, fiddles, mumbles. "Let him go. Let the man run. I don't want him to hear."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The boy teases her. "Babe now, what sort of bad black act you putting on? He wants to hear you do your thing. Your darkie thing, right? You did the spooky card?reading bit and now you can do the banjo bit and maybe you can do the hot momma bit afterwards but it doesn't look like it right now, right?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Ease off, nigger," she says, face still bent low. "Sometime you going to lean too hard."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit asks her shyly, "You play the piano?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He gives me bad vibes," Babe confesses to the two black men. "Those knuckles of his aren't too good. Bad shadows in there."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan surprises Harry by reaching and covering her thin bare hands with one of his broadened big pressman's hands, a ring of milk?blue jade on one finger, battered bright copper on another. His other arm reaches around Harry's shoulders, heavy. "Suppose you was him," he says to Babe, "how would that make you feel?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Bad," she says. "As bad as I feel anyway."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Play for me Babe," Rabbit says in the lovingness of pot, and she lifts her eyes to his and lets her lips pull back on long yellow teeth and gums the color of rhubarb stems. "Men," Babe gaily drawls. "They sure can retail the shit." She pushes herself out of the booth, hobbling in her comb?red dress, and crosses through a henscratch of applause to the piano painted as if by children in silver swirls. She signals to the bar for Rufe to turn on the blue spot and bows stiffly, once, grudging the darkness around her a smile and, after a couple of runs to burn away the fog, plays.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> What does Babe play? All the good old ones. All show tunes. "Up a Lazy River," "You're the Top," "Thou Swell," "Summertime," you know. There are hundreds, thousands. Men from Indiana wrote them in Manhattan. They flow into each other without edges, flowing under black bridges of chords thumped six, seven times, as if Babe is helping the piano to remember a word it won't say. Or spanking the silence. Or saying, Here I am, find me, find me. Her hands, all brown bone, hang on the keyboard hushed like gloves on a table; she gazes up through blue dust to get herself into focus, she lets her hands fall into another tune: "My Funny Valentine," "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," "I Can't Get Started," starting to hum along with herself now, lyrics born in some distant smoke, decades when Americans moved within the American dream, laughing at it, starving on it, but living it, humming it, the national anthem everywhere. Wise guys and hicks, straw boaters and bib overalls, fast bucks, broken hearts, penthouses in the sky, shacks by the railroad tracks, ups and downs, rich and poor, trolley cars, and the latest news by radio. Rabbit had come in on the end of it, as the world shrank like an apple going bad and America was no longer the wisest hick town within a boat ride of Europe and Broadway forgot the tune, but here it all still was, in the music Babe played, the little stairways she climbed and came tap?dancing down, twinkling in black, and there is no other music, not really, though Babe works in some Beatles songs, "Yesterday" and "Hey Jude," doing it rinky?tink, her own style of ice to rattle in the glass. As Babe plays she takes on swaying and leaning backwards; at her arms' ends the standards go root back into ragtime. Rabbit sees circus tents and fireworks and farmers' wagons and an empty sandy river running so slow the sole motion is catfish sleeping beneath the golden skin.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The boy leans forward and murmurs to Rabbit, "You want ass, right? You can have her. Fifty gets you her all night, all ways you can think up. She knows a lot."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Sunk in her music, Rabbit is lost. He shakes his head and says, "She's too good."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Good, man; she got to live, right? This place don't pay her shit."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Babe has become a railroad, prune?head bobbing, napkin of jewels flashing blue, music rolling through crazy places, tunnels of dissonance and open stretches of the same tinny thin note bleeding itself into the sky, all sad power and happiness worn into holes .like shoe soles. From the dark booths around voices call out in a mutter "Go Babe" and "Do it, do it." The spidery boys in the adjacent room are frozen around the green felt. Into the mike that is there no bigger than a lollipop she begins to sing, sings in a voice that is no woman's voice at all and no man's, is merely human, the words of Ecclesiastes. A time to be born, a time to die. A time to gather up stones, a time to cast stones away. Yes. The Lord's last word. There is no other word, not really. Her singing opens up, grows enormous, frightens Rabbit with its enormous black maw of truth yet makes him overjoyed that he is here; he brims with joy, to be here with these black others, he wants to shout love through the darkness of Babe's noise to the sullen brother in goatee and glasses. He brims with this itch but does not spill. For Babe stops. As if suddenly tired or insulted Babe breaks off the song and shrugs and quits.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> That is how Babe plays.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She comes back to the table stooped, trembling, nervous, old.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That was beautiful, Babe," Rabbit tells her.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It was," says another voice. A small white girl is standing there prim, in a white dress casual and dirty as smoke.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hey. Jill," Buchanan says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hi Buck. Skeeter, hi."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> So Skeeter is his name. He scowls and looks at the cigarette of which there is not even butt enough to call a roach.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> ` Jilly?love," Buchanan says, standing until his thighs scrape the table edge, "allow me to introduce. Harry the Rabbit Angstrom, he works at the printing plant with me, along with his daddy."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He has a daddy?" Jill asks, still looking at Skeeter, who will not look at her.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Jilly, you go sit in here where I am," Buchanan says. "I'll go get a chair from Rufe."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Down, baby," Skeeter says. "I'm splitting." No one offers to argue with him. Perhaps they are all as pleased as Rabbit to see him go.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan chuckles, he rubs his hands. His eyes keep in touch with all of them, even though Babe seems to be dozing. He says to Jill, "How about a beverage? A 7?Up? Rufe can make a lemonade even."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nothing," Jill says. Teaparty manner. Hands in lap. Thin arms. Freckles. Rabbit scents in her the perfume of class. She excites him.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Maybe she'd like a real drink," he says. With a white woman here he feels more in charge. Negroes, you can't blame them, haven't had his advantages. Slave ships, cabins, sold down the river, Ku Klux Klan, James Earl Ray: Channel 44 keeps having these documentaries all about it.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'm under age," Jill tells him politely.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit says, "Who cares?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She answers, "The police."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not up the street they wouldn't mind so much," Buchanan explains, "if the girl halfway acted the part, but down here they get a touch fussy."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "The fuzz is fussy," Babe says dreamily. "The fuzz is our fussy friends. The fuzzy motherfuckers fuss."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't, Babe," Jill begs. "Don't pretend."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You let your old black mamma have a buzz on," Babe says. "Don't I take good care of you mostly?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How would the police know if this kid has a drink?" Rabbit asks, willing to be indignant.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan makes his high short wheeze. "Friend Harry, they'd just have to turn their heads."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "There're cops in here?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Friend" ? and from the way he sidles closer Harry feels he's found another father? "if it weren't for po?lice spies, poor Jimbo's wouldn't sell two beers a night. Po?lice spies are the absolute backbone of local low life. They got so many plants going, that's why they don't dare shoot in riots, for fear of killing one of their own."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Like over in York."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Jill asks Rabbit, "Hey. You live in Brewer?" He sees that she doesn't like his being white in here, and smiles without answering. Screw you, little girl.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan answers for him. "Lady, does he live in Brewer? If he lived any more in Brewer he'd be a walking advertisement. He'd be the Owl Pretzel owl. I don't think this fella's ever gotten above Twelfth Street, have you Harry?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "A few times. I was in Texas in the Army, actually."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Did you get to fight?" Jill asks. Something scratchy here, but maybe like a kitten it's the way of making contact.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I was all set to go to Korea," he says. "But they never sent me." Though at the time he was grateful, it has since eaten at him, become the shame of his life. He had never been a fighter but now there is enough death in him so that in a way he wants to kill.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Now Skeeter," Buchanan is saying, "he's just back from Vietnam."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's why he so rude," Babe offers.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I couldn't tell if he was rude or not," Rabbit confesses.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's nice," Buchanan says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He was rude," Babe says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Jill's lemonade arrives. She is still girl enough to look happy when it is set before her: cakes at the teaparty. Her face lights up. A crescent of lime clings to the edge of the glass; she takes it off and sucks and makes a sour face. A child's plumpness has been drained from her before a woman's bones could grow and harden. She is the reddish type of fair; her hair hangs dull, without fire, almost flesh?color, or the color of the flesh of certain soft trees, yews or cedars. Harry feels protective, timidly. In her tension of small bones she reminds him of Nelson. He asks her, "What do you do, Jill?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nothing much," she says. "Hang around." It had been square of him to ask, pushing. The blacks fit around her like shadows.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;"Jilly's a poor soul," Babe volunteers, stirring within her buzz. "She's fallen on evil ways." And she pats Rabbit's hand as if to say, Don't you fall upon these ways.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Young Jill," Buchanan clarifies, "has run away from her home up there in Connec?ticut."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit asks her, "Why would you do that?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why not? Let freedom ring."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Can I ask how old you are?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You can ask."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'm asking."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Babe hasn't let go of Rabbit's hand; with the fingernail of her index finger she is toying with the hairs on the back of his fist. It makes his teeth go cold, for her to do that. "Not so old you couldn't be her daddy," Babe says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He is beginning to get the drift. They are presenting him with this problem. He is the consultant honky. The girl, too, unwilling as she is, is submitting to the interview. She inquires of him, only partly parrying, "How old are you?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Thirty?six."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Divide by two."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Eighteen, huh? How long've you been on the run? Away from your parents."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Her daddy dead," Buchanan interposes softly.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Long enough, thank you." Her face pales, her freckles stand out sharply: blood?dots that have dried brown. Her dry little lips tighten; her chin drifts toward him. She is pulling rank. He is Penn Villas, she is Penn Park. Rich kids make all the trouble.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Long enough for what?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Long enough to do some sick things."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Are you sick?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'm cured."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan interposes, "Babe helped her out."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Babe is a beautiful person," Jill says. "I was really a mess when Babe took me in."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> ` Jilly is my sweetie," Babe says, as suddenly as in playing she moves from one tune to another, ` Jilly is my baby?love and I'm her mamma?love," and takes her brown hands away from Harry's to encircle the girl's waist and hug her against the roostercomb?red of her dress; the two are women, though one is a prune and the other a milkweed. Jill pouts in pleasure. Her mouth is lovable when it moves, Rabbit thinks, the lower lip bumpy and dry as if chapped, though this is not winter but the humid height of summer.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan is further explaining. "Fact of it is, this girl hasn't got no place regular to go. Couple weeks ago, she comes in here, not knowing I suppose the place was mostly for soul, a little pretty girl like this get in with some of the brothers they would tear her apart limb by sweet limb" ? he has to chuckle ? "so Babe takes her right away under her wing. Only trouble with that is" ? the fat man rustles closer, making the booth a squeeze ? "Babe's place is none too big, and anyways. . ."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The child flares up. "Anyways I'm not welcome." Her eyes widen: Rabbit has not seen their color before, they have been shadowy, moving slowly, as if their pink lids are tender or as if, rejecting instruction and inventing her own way of moving through the world, she has lost any vivid idea of what to be looking for. Her eyes are green. The dry tired green, yet one of his favorite colors, of August grass.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Jilly?love," Babe says, hugging, "you the most welcome little white baby there could be."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan is talking only to Rabbit, softer and softer. "You know, those things happen over York way, they could happen here, and how could we protect" ? the smallest wave of his hand toward the girl lets the sentence gracefully hang; Harry is reminded of Stavros's gestures. Buchanan ends chuckling: "We be so busy keepin' holes out of our own skins. Dependin' where you get caught, being black's a bad ticket both ways!"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Jill snaps, "I'll be all right. You two stop it now. Stop trying to sell me to this creep. I don't want him. He doesn't want me. Nobody wants me. That's all right. I don't want anybody."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Everybody wants somebody," Babe says. "I don't mind your hangin' around my place, some gentlemen mind, is all."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit says, "Buchanan minds," and this perception astonishes them; the two blacks break into first shrill, then jingling, laughter, and another Stinger appears on the table between his hands, pale as lemonade.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Honey, it's just the visibility," Babe then adds sadly. "You make us ever so visible."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> A silence grows like the silence when a group of adults is waiting for a child to be polite. Sullenly Jill asks Rabbit, "What do you do?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Set type," Rabbit tells her. "Watch TV. Babysit."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Harry here," Buchanan explains, "had a nasty shock the other day. His wife for no good reason upped and left him."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No reason at all?" Jill asks. Her mouth pouts forward, vexed and aggressive, yet her spark of interest dies before her breath is finished with the question.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit thinks. "I think I bored her. Also, we didn't agree politically."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What about?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "The Vietnam war. I'm all for it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Jill snatches in her breath.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Babe says, "I knew those knuckles looked bad."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan offers to smooth it over. "Everybody at the plant is for it. We think, you don't hold 'em over there, you'll have those black?pajama fellas on the streets over here."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Jill says to Rabbit seriously, "You should talk to Skeeter about it. He says it was a fabulous trip. He loved it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I wouldn't know about that. I'm not saying it's pleasant to fight in or be caught in. I just don't like the kids making the criticisms. People say it's a mess so we should get out. If you stayed out of every mess you'd never get into anything."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Amen," Babe says. "Life is generally shit."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit goes on, feeling himself get rabid, "I guess I don't much believe in college kids or the Viet Cong. I don't think they have any answers. I think they're minorities trying to bring down everything that halfway works. Halfway isn't all the way but it's better than no way."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan smooths on frantically. His upper lip is bubbling with sweat under his slit of a mustache. "I agree ninety?nine per cent. Enlightened self?interest is the phrase I like. The way I see, enlightened self?interest's the best deal we're likely to get down here. I don't buy pie in the sky whoever is slicing it. These young ones like Skeeter, they say All power to the people, you look around for the people, the only people around is them."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Because of Toms like you," Jill says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan blinks. His voice goes deeper, hurt. "I ain't no Tom, girl. That kind of talk doesn't help any of us. That kind of talk just shows how young you are. What I am is a man trying to get from Point A to Point B, from the cradle to the grave hurting the fewest people I can. Just like Harry here, if you'd ask him. Just like your late daddy, God rest his soul."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Babe says, hugging the stubbornly limp girl, "I just likes Jilly's spunk, she's less afraid what to do with her life than fat old smelly you, sittin' there lickin' yourself like an old cigar end." But while talking she keeps her eyes on Buchanan as if his concurrence is to be desired. Mothers and fathers, they turn up everywhere.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan explains to Jill with a nice levelness, "So that is the problem. Young Harry here lives in this fancy big house over in the fanciest part of West Brewer, all by himself, and never gets any tail."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry protests. "I'm not that alone. I have a kid with me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Man has to have tail," Buchanan is continuing.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Play, Babe," a dark voice shouts from a dark booth. Rufe bobs his head and switches on the blue spot. Babe sighs and offers Jill what is left of Skeeter's joint. Jill shakes her head and gets out of the booth to let Babe out. Rabbit thinks the girl is leaving and discovers himself glad when she sits down again, opposite him. He sips his Stinger and she chews the ice from her lemonade while Babe plays again. This time the boys in the poolroom softly keep at their game. The clicking and the liquor and the music mix and make the space inside him very big, big enough to hold blue light and black faces and "Honeysuckle Rose" and stale smoke sweeter than alfalfa and this apparition across the way, whose wrists and forearms are as it were translucent and belonging to another order of creature; she is not yet grown. Her womanliness is attached to her, it floats from her like a little zeppelin he can almost see. And his inside space expands to include beyond Jimbo's the whole world with its arrowing wars and polychrome races, its continents shaped like ceiling stains, its strings of gravitational attraction attaching it to every star, its glory in space as of a blue marble swirled with clouds; everything is warm, wet, still coming to birth but himself and his home, which remains a strange dry place, dry and cold and emptily spinning in the void of Penn Villas like a cast?off space capsule. He doesn't want to go there but he must. He must. "I must go," he says, rising.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hey, hey," Buchanan protests. "The night hasn't even got itself turned around to get started yet."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I ought to be home in case my kid can't stand the kid he's staying with. I promised I'd visit my parents tomorrow, if they didn't keep my mother in the hospital for more tests."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Babe will be sad, you sneaking out. She took a shine to you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Maybe that other guy she took a shine to will be back. My guess is Babe takes a shine pretty easy."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't you get nasty."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No, I love her, Jesus. Tell her. She plays like a whiz. This has been a terrific change of pace for me." He tries to stand, but the table edge confines him to a crouch. The booth tilts and he rocks slightly, as if he is already in the slowly turning cold house he is heading toward. Jill stands up with him, obedient as a mirror.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "One of these times," Buchanan continues beneath them, "maybe you can get to know Babe better. She is one good egg."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't doubt it." He tells Jill, "Sit down."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Aren't you going to take me with you? They want you to."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Gee. I hadn't thought to."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She sits down.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Friend Harry, you've hurt the little girl's feelings. Nasty must be your middle name."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Jill says, "Far as creeps like this are concerned, I have no feelings. I've decided he's queer anyway."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Could be," Buchanan says. "It would explain that wife."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Come on, let me out of the booth. I'd like to take her -'
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Then help yourself, friend. On me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Babe is playing "Time After Time." I tell myself that I'm.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry sags. The table edge is killing his thighs. "O.K., kid. Come along."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I wouldn't dream of it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You'll be bored," he feels in honesty obliged to add.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You've been had," she tells him.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Jilly now, be gracious for the gentleman." Buchanan hastily pushes out of the booth, lest the combination tumble, and lets Harry slide out and leans against him confidentially. Geezers. His breath rises bad, from under the waxed needles. "Problem is," he explains, the last explaining he will do tonight, "it don't look that good, her being in here, under age and all. The fuzz now, they aren't absolutely unfriendly, but they hold us pretty tight to the line, what with public opinion the way it is. So it's not that healthy for anybody. She's a poor child needs a daddy, is the simple truth of it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit asks her, "How'd he die?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Jill says, "Heart. Dropped dead in a New York theater lobby. He and my mother were seeing Hair."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "O.K. Let's shove." To Buchanan Rabbit says, "How much for the drinks? Wow. They're just hitting me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "On us," is the answer, accompanied by a wave of a palm the color of silver polish. "On the black community." He has to wheeze and chuckle. Struggling for solemnity: "This is real big of you, man. You're a big man."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "See you at work Monday."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Jilly?love, you be a good girl. We'll keep in touch."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I bet."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Disturbing, to think that Buchanan works. We all work. Day selves and night selves. The belly hungers, the spirit hungers. Mouths munch, cunts swallow. Monstrous. Soul. He used to try to picture it when a child. A parasite like a tapeworm inside. A sprig of mistletoe hung from our bones, living on air. A jellyfish swaying between our lungs and our liver. Black men have more, bigger. Cocks like eels. Night feeders. Their touching underbelly smell on buses, their dread of those clean dry places where Harry must be. He wonders if he will be sick. Poison in those Stingers, on top of moonburgers.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Babe shifts gears, lays out six chords like six black lead slugs slapping into the tray, and plays, "There's a Small Hotel." With a wishing well.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> With this Jill, then, Rabbit enters the street. On his right, toward the mountain, Weiser stretches sallow under blue street lights. The Pinnacle Hotel makes a tattered blur, the back of the Sunflower Beer clock shows yellow neon petals; otherwise the great street is dim. He can remember when Weiser with its five movie marquees and its medley ofneon outlines appeared as gaudy as a carnival midway. People would stroll, children between them. Now the downtown looks deserted, sucked dry by suburban shopping centers and haunted by rapists. LOCAL HOODS ASSAULT ELDERLY, last week's Vat had headlined. In the original version of the head LOCAL had been BLACK.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> They turn left, toward the Running Horse Bridge. River moisture cools his brow. He decides he will not be sick. Never, even as an infant, could stand it; some guys, Ronnie Harrison for one, liked it, throw up after a few beers or before a big game, joke about the corn between their teeth, but Rabbit needed to keep it down, even at the cost of a bellyache. He still carries from sitting in Jimbo's the sense of the world being inside him; he will keep it down. The city night air. The ginger of tar and concrete baked all day, truck traffic lifted from it like a lid. Infrequent headlights stroke this girl, catching her white legs and thin dress as she hangs on the curb hesitant.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She asks, "Where's your car?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't have any."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's impossible."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "My wife took it when she left me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You didn't have two?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No." This is really a rich kid.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I have a car," she says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Where is it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't know."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How can you not know?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I used to leave it on the street up near Babe's place off of Plum, I didn't know it was somebody's garage entrance, and one morning they had taken it away."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And you didn't go after it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I didn't have the money for any fine. And I'm scared of the police, they might check me out. The staties must have a bulletin on me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Wouldn't the simplest thing for you be to go back to Connecticut?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, please," she says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What didn't you like about it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It was all ego. Sick ego."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Something pretty egotistical about running away, too. What'd that do to your mother?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The girl makes no answer, but crosses the street, from Jimbo's to the beginning of the bridge. Rabbit has to follow. "What kind of car was it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "A white Porsche." Wow."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "My father gave it to me for my sixteenth birthday."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "My father?in?law runs the Toyota agency in town."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> They keep arriving at this place, where a certain symmetry snips their exchanges short. Having crossed the bridge, they stand on a little pond of sidewalk squares where in this age of cars few feet tread. The bridge was poured in the Thirties ? sidewalks, broad balustrades, and lamp plinths ? of reddish rough concrete; above them an original light standard, iron fluted and floral toward the top, looms stately but unlit at the entrance to the bridge, illumined since recently with cold bars of violet on tall aluminum stems rooted in the center of the walkway. Her white dress is unearthly in this light. A man's name is embedded in a bronze plaque, illegible. Jill asks impatiently, "Well, how shall we do?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He assumes she means transportation. He is too shaky still, too full of smoke and Stinger, to look beyond that. The way to the center of Brewer, where taxis prowl and doze, feels blocked. In the gloom beyond Jimbo's neon nimbus, brown shadows, local hoods, giggle in doorways, watching. Rabbit says, "Let's walk across the bridge and hope for a bus. The last one comes around eleven, maybe on Saturdays it's later. Anyway, if none comes at all, it's not too far to walk to my place. My kid does it all the time."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I love walking," she says. She touchingly adds, "I'm strong. You mustn't baby me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The balustrade was poured in an X?pattern echoing rail fences; these Xs click past his legs not rapidly enough. The gritty breadth he keeps touching runs tepid. Flecks as if of rock salt had been mixed into it. Not done that way anymore, not done this color, reddish, the warmth of flesh, her hair also, cut cedar color, lifting as she hurries to keep up.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What's the rush?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Shhh. Dontcha hear 'em?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Cars thrust by, rolling balls of light before them. An anvil?drop below, to the black floor of the river: white shards, boat shapes. Behind them, pattering feet, the press of pursuit. Rabbit dares stop and peek backwards. Two brown figures are chasing them. Their shadows shorten and multiply and lengthen and simplify again as they fly beneath the successive mauve angles, in and out of strips of light; one man is brandishing something white in his hand. It glitters. Harry's heart jams; he wants to make water. The West Brewer end of the bridge is forever away. LOCAL MAN STABBED DEFENDING OUT?OF?STATE GIRL. Body Tossed From Historic Bridge. He squeezes her arm and tries to make her run. Her skin is smooth and narrow yet tepid like the balustrade. She snaps, "Cut it out," and pulls away. He turns and finds, unexpectedly, what he had forgotten was there, courage; his body fits into the hardshell blindness of meeting a threat, rigid, only his eyes soft spots, himself a sufficient shield. Kill.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The Negroes halt under the near purple moon and back a step, frightened. They are young, their bodies liquid. He is bigger than they. The white flash in the hand of one is not a knife but a pocketbook of pearls. The bearer shambles forward with it. His eyewhites and the pearls look lavender in the light. "This yours, lady?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh. Yes."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Babe sent us after."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh. Thank you. Thank her."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "We scare somebody?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not me. Him."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Dude scared us too."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Sorry about that," Rabbit volunteers. "Spooky bridge."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "O.K."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "O.K." Their mauve eyeballs roll; their purple hands flip as their legs in the stitched skin of Levis seek the rhythm of leaving. They giggle together; and also at this moment two giant trailer trucks pass on the bridge, headed in opposite directions: their rectangles thunderously overlap and, having clapped the air between them, hurtle each on its way, corrosive and rumbling. The bridge trembles. The Negro boys have disappeared. Rabbit walks on with Jill.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The pot and brandy and fear in him enhance the avenue he knows too well. No bus comes. Her dress flutters in the corner of his eye as he tries, his skin stretched and his senses shuffling and circling like a cloud of gnats, to make talk. "Your home was in Connecticut."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "A place called Stonington."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Near New York?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Near enough. Daddy used to go down Mondays and come back Fridays. He loved to sail. He said about Stonington it was the only town in the state that faces the open sea, everything else is on the Sound."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And he died, you said. My mother ? she has Parkinson's Disease."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Look, do you like to talk this much? Why don't we just walk? I've never been in West Brewer before. It's nice."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What's nice about it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Everything. It doesn't have a past like the city does. So it's not so disappointed. Look at that, Burger Bliss. Isn't it beautiful, all goldy and plasticky with that purple fire inside?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's where I ate tonight."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How was the food?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Awful. Maybe I taste everything too much, I should start smoking again. My kid loves the place."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How old did you say he was?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Twelve. Thirteen this October. He's small for his age."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You shouldn't tell him that."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah. I try not to ride him."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What would you ride him about?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh. He's bored by things I used to love. I don't think he's having much fun. He never goes outdoors."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hey. What's your name?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Harry."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hey, big Hang. Would you mind feeding me?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Sure, I mean No. At home? I don't know what we have in the icebox. Refrigerator."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I mean over there, at the burger place."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, sure. Terrific. I'm sorry. I assumed you ate."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Maybe I did, I tend to forget material details like that. But I don't think so. All I feel inside is lemonade."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She selects a Cashewburger for 85￠ and a strawberry milkshake. In the withering light she devours the burger, and he orders her another. She smiles apologetically. She has small inturned teeth, roundish and with tiny gaps between them like a printer's hairline spaces. Nice. "Usually I try to rise above eating."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's so ugly. Don't you think, it's one of the uglier things we do?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It has to be done."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's your philosophy, isn't it?" Even in this garishly lit place her face has about it something shadowy and elusive, something that's skipped a stage. Finished, she wipes her fingers one by one on a paper napkin and says decisively, "Thank you very much." He pays. She clutches the purse, but what is in it? Credit cards? Diagrams for the revolution?
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He has had coffee, to keep himself awake. Be up all night fucking this poor kid. Upholding the honor of middle?aged squares. Different races. In China, they used to tell you in the Army, the women put razor blades in their cunts in case the Japanese tried rape. Rabbit's scrotum shrivels at the thought. Enjoy the walk. They march down Weiser, the store windows dark but for burglar lights, the Acme parking lot empty but for scattered neckers, the movie marquee changed from 2001 to TRUE GRIT. Short enough to get it all on. They cross the street at a blinking yellow to Emberly Avenue, which then becomes Emberly Drive, which becomes Vista Crescent. The development is dark. "Talk about spooky," she says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I think it's the flatness," he says. "The town I grew up in, no two houses were on the same level."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "There's such a smell of plumbing somehow."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Actually, the plumbing is none too good."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> This smoky creature at his side has halved his weight. He floats up the steps to the porchlet, knees vibrating. Her profile by his shoulder is fine and cool as the face on the old dime. The key to the door of three stepped windows nearly flies out of his hand, it feels so magical. Whatever he expects when he flicks on the inside hall light, it is not the same old furniture, the fake cobbler's bench, the sofa and the silverthread chair facing each other like two bulky drunks too tired to go upstairs. The blank TV screen in its box of metal painted with wood grain, the see?through shelves with nothing on them.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Wow," Jill says. "This is really tacky."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit apologizes, "We never really picked out the furniture, it just kind of happened. Janice was always going to do different curtains."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Jill asks, "Was she a good wife?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> His answer is nervous; the question plants Janice back in the house, quiet in the kitchen, crouching at the head of the stairs, listening. "Not too bad. Not much on organizational ability, but until she got mixed up with this other guy at least she kept plugging away. She used to drink too much but got that under control. We had a tragedy about ten years ago that sobered her up I guess. Sobered me up too. A baby died."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "An accident we caused."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's sad. Where do we sleep?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why don't you take the kid's room, I guess he won't be back. The kid he's staying with, he's a real spoiled jerk, I told Nelson if it got too painful he should just come home. I probably should have been here to answer the phone. What time is it? How about a beer?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Penniless, she is wearing a little wristwatch that must have cost two hundred at least. "Twelve?ten," she says. "Don't you want to sleep with me?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Huh? That's not your idea of bliss, is it? Sleeping with a creep?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You are a creep, but you just fed me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Forget it. On the white community. Ha."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And you have this sweet funny family side. Always worrying about who needs you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah, well it's hard to know sometimes. Probably nobody if I could face up to it. In answer to your question, sure I'd like to sleep with you, if I won't get hauled in for statutory rape."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You're really scared of the law, aren't you?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I try to keep out of its way is all."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I promise you on a Bible ? do you have a Bible?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "There used to be one somewhere, that Nelson got for going to Sunday school, when he did. We've kind of let all that go. Just promise me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I promise you I'm eighteen. I'm legally a woman. I am not bait for a black gang. You will not be mugged or blackmailed. You may fuck me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Somehow you're making me almost cry."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You're awfully scared of me. Let's take a bath together and then see how we feel about it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He laughs. "By then I guess I'll feel pretty gung?ho about it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She is serious, a serious small?faced animal sniffing out her new lair. "Where's the bathroom?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Take off your clothes here."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The command startles her; her chin dents and her eyes go wide with fright. No reason he should be the only scared person here. Rich bitch calling his living room tacky. Standing on the rug where he and Janice last made love, Jill skins out of her clothes. She kicks off her sandals and strips her dress upward. She is wearing no bra. Her tits tug upward, drop back, give him a headless stare. She is wearing bikini underpants, black lace, in a pattern too fine to read. Not pausing a moment for him to drink her in, she pulls the elastic down with two thumbs, wriggles, and steps out. Where Janice had a springy triangle encroaching on the insides ofher thighs when she didn't shave, Jill has scarcely a shadow, amber fuzz dust darkened toward the center to an upright dainty mane. The horns of her pelvis like starved cheekbones. Her belly a child's, childless. Her breasts in some lights as she turns scarcely exist. Being naked elongates her neck: a true ripeness there, in the unhurried curve from base of skull to small of back, and in the legs, which link to the hips with knots of fat and keep a plumpness all the way down. Her ankles are less slim than Janice's. But, hey, she is naked in this room, his room. This really strange creature, too trusting. She bends to pick up her clothes. She treads lightly on his carpet, as if watchful for tacks. She stands an arm's?length from him, her mouth pouting prim, a fleck of dry skin on the lower lip. "And you?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Upstairs." He undresses in his bedroom, where he always does; in the bathroom on the other side of the partition, water begins to cry, to sing, to splash. He looks down and has nothing of a hard?on. In the bathroom he finds her bending over to test the temperature mix at the faucet. A tuft between her buttocks. From behind she seems a boy's slim back wedged into the upsidedown valentine of a woman's satin rear. He yearns to touch her, to touch the satin symmetry, and does. It stings his figertips like glass we don't expect is there. Jill doesn't deign to flinch or turn at his touch, testing the water to her satisfaction. His cock stays small but has stopped worrying.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Their bath is all too gentle, silent, liquid, and pure. They are each attentive: he soaps and rinses her breasts as if their utter cleanness challenges him to make them even cleaner; she kneels and kneads his back as if a year of working weariness were in it. She blinds him in drenched cloth; she counts the gray hairs (six) in the hair of his chest. Still even as they stand to dry each other and he looms above her like a Viking he cannot shake the contented impotence ofhis sensation that they are the ends ofspotlight beams thrown on the clouds, that their role is to haunt this house like two bleached creatures on a television set entertaining an empty room.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She glances at his groin. "I don't turn you on exactly, do I?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You do, you do. Too much. It's still too strange. I don't even know your last name."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Pendleton." She drops to her knees on the bathroom rug and takes his penis into her mouth. He backs away as if bitten.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Wait."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Jill looks up at him crossly, looks up the slope of his slack gut, a cranky puzzled child with none of the answers in the last class of the day, her mouth slick with forbidden candy. He lifts her as he would a child, but she is longer than a child, and her armpits are scratchy and deep; he kisses her on the mouth. No gumdrops, her lips harden and she twists her thin face away, saying into his shoulder, "I don't turn anybody on, much. No tits. My mother has nifty tits, maybe that's my trouble."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Tell me about your trouble," he says, and leads her by the hand toward the bedroom.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, Jesus, one of those. Trouble?shooters. From the look of it you're in worse shape than me, you can't even respond when somebody takes off their clothes."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "First times are hard; you need to absorb somebody a little first." He darkens the room and they lie on the bed. She offers to embrace him again, hard mouth and sharp knees anxious to have it done, but he smooths her onto her back and massages her breasts, plumping them up, circling. "These aren't your trouble," he croons. "These are lovely." Down below he feels himself easily stiffening, clotting: cream in the freezer. CLINIC FOR RUNAWAYS OPENED. Fathers Do Duty On Nights Off.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Relaxing, Jill grows stringy; tendons and resentments come to the surface. "You should be fucking my mother, she really is good with men, she thinks they're the be?all and end?all. I know she was playing around, even before Daddy died."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Is that why you ran away?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You wouldn't believe if I really told you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Tell me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "A guy I went with tried to get me into heavy drugs."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's not so unbelievable."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah, but his reason was crazy. Look, you don't want to hear this crap. You're up now, why don't you just give it to me?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Tell me his reason."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You see, when I'd trip, I'd see, like, you know ? God. He never would. He just saw pieces of like old movies, that didn't add up."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What kind of stuff did he give you? Pot?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, no, listen, pot is just like having a Coke or something. Acid, when he could get it. Strange pills. He'd rob doctors' cars to get their samples and then mix them to see what happened. They have names for all these pills, purple hearts, dollies, I don't know what all. Then after he stole this syringe he'd inject stuff, he wouldn't even know what it was half the time, it was wild. I would never let him break my skin. I figured, anything went in by the mouth, I could throw it up, but anything went in my veins, I had no way to get rid of it, it could kill me. He said that was part of the kick. He was really freaked, but he had this, you know, power over me. I ran."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Has he tried to follow you?" A freak coming up the stairs. Green teeth, poisonous needles. Rabbit's penis has wilted, listening.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No, he's not the type. Toward the end I don't think he knew me from Adam really, all he was thinking about was his next fix. Junkies are like that. They get to be bores. You think they're talking to you or making love or whatever, and then you realize they're looking over your shoulder for the next fix. You realize you're nothing. He didn't need me to find God for him, if he met God right on the street he'd've tried to hustle Him for money enough for a couple bags."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What did he look like?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, about five?ten, brown hair down to his shoulders, slightly wavy when he brushed it, a neat build. Even after smack had pulled all the color from him he had a wonderful frame. His back was really marvellous, with long sloping shoulders and all these ripply little ribby bumps behind, you know, here." She touches him but is seeing the other. "He had been a runner in junior high."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I meant God."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, God. He changed. He was different every time. But you always knew it was Him. Once I remember something like the inside of a big lily, only magnified a thousand times, a sort of glossy shining funnel that went down and down. I can't talk about it." She rolls over and kisses him on the mouth feverishly. His slowness to respond seems to excite her; she gets up in a crouch and like a raccoon drinking water kisses his chin, his chest, his navel, goes down and stays. Her mouth nibbling is so surprising he fights the urge to laugh; her fingers on the hair of his thighs tickle like the threat of ice on his skin. The hair of her head makes a tent on his belly. He pushes at her but she sticks at it: he might as well relax. The ceiling. The garage light shining upwards shows a stained patch where chimney flashing let the rain in. Must turn the garage light off. Though maybe a good burglar preventive. These junkies around steal anything. He wonders how Nelson made out. Asleep, boy sleeps on his back, mouth open, frightening; skin seems to tighten on the bone like in pictures of Buchenwald. Always tempted to wake him, prove he's O.K. Missed the eleveno'clock news tonight. Vietnam death count, race riots probably somewhere. Funny man, Buchanan. No plan, exactly, just feeling his way, began by wanting to sell him Babe, maybe that's the way to live. Janice in bed got hot like something cooking but this kid stays cool, a prep?school kid applying what she knows. It works.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's nice," she says, stroking the extent of his extended cock, glistening with her spittle.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You're nice," he tells her, "not to lose faith."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I like it," she tells him, "making you get big and strong."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why bother?" he asks. "I'm a creep."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Want to come into me?" the girl asks. But when she lies on her back and spreads her legs, her lack of self?consciousness again strikes him as sad, and puts him off, as does the way she winces when he seeks to enter; so that he grows small. Her blurred face widens its holes and says with a rising inflection, "You don't like me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> While he fumbles for an answer, she falls asleep. It is the answer to a question he hadn't thought to ask: was she tired? Of course, just as she was hungry. A guilty grief expands his chest muscles and presses on the backs of his eyes. He gets up, covers her with a sheet. The nights are growing cool, August covers the sun's retreat. The cold moon. Scraped wallpaper. Pumice stone under a flash bulb. Footprints stay for a billion years, not a fleck of dust blows. The kitchen linoleum is cold on his feet. He switches off the garage light and spreads peanut butter on six Saltines, making three sandwiches. Since Janice left, he and Nelson shop for what they like, keep themselves stocked in salt and starch. He eats the crackers sitting in the living room, not in the silverthread chair but the old brown mossy one, that they've had since their marriage. He chews and stares at the uninhabited aquarium of the television screen. Ought to smash it, poison, he read somewhere the reason kids today are so crazy they were brought up on television, two minutes of this, two minutes of that. Cracker crumbs adhere to the hair of his chest. Six gray. Must be more than that. What did Janice do for Stavros she didn't do for him? Only so much you can do. Three holes, two hands. Is she happy? He hopes so. Poor mutt, he somehow squelched her potential. Let things bloom. The inside of a great lily. He wonders if Jesus will be waiting for Mom, a man in a nightgown at the end of a glossy chute. He hopes so. He remembers he must work tomorrow, then remembers he mustn't, it is Sunday. Sunday, that dog of a day. Ruth used to mock him and church, in those days he could get himself up for anything. Ruth and her chicken farm, wonders if she can stand it. Hopes so. He pushes himself up from the fat chair, brushes crumbs from his chest hair. Some fall and catch further down. Wonder why it was made so curly there, springy, they could stuff mattresses with it, if people would shave, like nuns and wigs. Upstairs, the body in his bed sinks his heart like a bar of silver. He had forgotten she was on his hands. Bad knuckles. The poor kid, she stirs and tries to make love to him again, gives him a furry?mouthed French kiss and falls asleep at it again. A day's work for a day's lodging. Puritan ethic. He masturbates, picturing Peggy Fosnacht. What will Nelson think?

<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Jill sleeps late. At quarter of ten Rabbit is rinsing his cereal bowl and coffee cup and Nelson is at the kitchen screen door, redfaced from pumping his bicycle. "Hey, Dad!"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Shh."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Your noise hurts my head."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Did you get drunk last night?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What sort of talk is that? I never get drunk."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Mrs. Fosnacht cried after you left."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Probably because you and Billy are such brats."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She said you were going to meet somebody in Brewer."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She shouldn't be telling kids things like that. These divorced women, turn their sons into little husbands: cry, shit, and change Tampax right in front of them. "Some guy I work with at Verity. We listened to some colored woman play the piano and then I came home."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "We stayed up past twelve o'clock watching a wicked neat movie about guys landing somewhere in boats that open up in front, some place like Norway -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Normandy."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's right. Were you there?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No, I was your age when it happened."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You could see the machine gun bullets making the water splash up all in a row, it was a blast."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hey, try to keep your voice down."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why, Dad? Is Mommy back? Is she?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No. Have you had any breakfast?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah, she gave us bacon and French toast. I learned how to make it, it's easy, you just smash some eggs and take bread and fry it, I'll make you some sometime."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Thanks. My mother used to make it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I hate her cooking. Everything tastes greasy. Didn't you used to hate her cooking, Dad?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I liked it. It was the only cooking I knew."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Billy Fosnacht says she's dying, is she?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She has a disease. But it's very slow. You've seen how she is. She may get better. They have new things for it all the time."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I hope she does die, Dad."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No you don't. Don't say that."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Mrs. Fosnacht tells Billy you should say everything you feel."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'm sure she tells him a lot of crap."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why do you say crap? I think she's nice, once you get used to her eyes. Don't you like her, Dad? She thinks you don't."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Peggy's O.K. What's on your schedule? When was the last time you went to Sunday school?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The boy circles around to place himself in his father's view. "There's a reason I rushed home. Mr. Fosnacht is going to take Billy fishing on the river in a boat some guy he knows owns and Billy asked if I could come along and I said I'd have to ask you. O.K., Dad? I had to come home anyway to get a bathing suit and clean pants, that fucking mini?bike got these all greasy."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> All around him, Rabbit hears language collapsing. He says weakly, "I didn't know there was fishing in the river."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "They've cleaned it up, Ollie says. At least above Brewer. He says they stock it with trout up around Eifert's Island."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ollie, is it? "That's hours from here. You've never fished. Remember how bored you were with the ball game we took you to."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That was a boring game, Dad. Other people were playing it. This is something you do yourself. Huh, Dad? O.K.? I got to get my bathing suit and I said I'd be back on the bicycle by ten?thirty." The kid is at the foot of the stairs: stop him.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit calls, "What am I going to do all day, if you go off?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You can go visit Mom?mom. She'd rather see just you anyway." The boy takes it that he has secured permission, and pounds upstairs. His scream from the landing freezes his father's stomach. Rabbit moves to the foot of the stairs to receive Nelson in his arms. But the boy, safe on the next?to?bottom step, halts there horrified. "Dad, something moved in your bed!"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "My bed?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I looked in and saw it!"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit offers, "Maybe it was just the air?conditioner fan lifting the sheets."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Dad." The child's pallor begins to recede as some flaw in the horror of this begins to dawn. "It had long hair, and I saw an arm. Aren't you going to call the police?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No, let's let the poor old police rest, it's Sunday. It's O.K., Nelson, I know who it is."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You do?" The boy's eyes sink upon themselves defensively as his brain assembles what information he has about long?haired creatures in bed. He is trying to relate this contraption of half?facts to the figure of his father looming, a huge riddle in an undershirt, before him. Rabbit offers, "It's a girl who's run away from home and I somehow got stuck with her last night."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Is she going to live here?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not ifyou don't want me to," Jill's voice composedly calls from the stairs. She has come down wrapped in a sheet. Sleep has made her more substantial, her eyes are fresh wet grass now. She says to the boy, "I'm Jill. You're Nelson. Your father told me all about you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She advances toward him in her sheet like a little Roman senator, her hair tucked under behind, her forehead shining. Nelson stands his ground. Rabbit is struck to see that they are nearly the same height. "Hi," the kid says. "He did?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, yes," Jill goes on, showing her class, becoming no doubt her own mother, a woman pouring out polite talk in an unfamiliar home, flattering vases, curtains. "You are very much on his mind. You're very fortunate, to have such a loving father."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The kid looks over with parted lips. Christmas morning. He doesn't know what it is, but he wants to like it, before it's unwrapped.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Tucking her sheet about her tighter, Jill moves them into the kitchen, towing Nelson along on the thread of her voice. "You're lucky, you're going on a boat. I love boats. Back home we had a twenty?two?foot sloop."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What's a sloop?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's a sailboat with one mast."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Some have more?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Of course. Schooners and yawls. A schooner has the big mast behind, a yawl has the big one up front. We had a yawl once but it was too much work, you needed another man really."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You used to sail?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "All summer until October. Not only that. In the spring we all used to have to scrape it and caulk it and paint it. I liked that almost the best, we all used to work at it together, my parents and me and my brothers."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How many brothers did you have?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Three. The middle one was about your age. Thirteen?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He nods. "Almost".
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He was my favorite. Is my favorite."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> A bird outside hoarsely scolds in sudden agitation. Cat? The refrigerator purrs.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson abruptly volunteers, "I had a sister once but she died."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What was her name?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> His father has to answer for him. "Rebecca."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Still Jill doesn't look toward him, but concentrates on the boy. "May I eat breakfast, Nelson?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Sure."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't want to take the last of your favorite breakfast cereal or anything."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You won't. I'll show you where we keep them. Don't take the Rice Krispies, they're a thousand years old and taste like floor fluff. The Raisin Bran and Alphabits are O.K., we bought them this week at the Acme."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Who does the shopping, you or your father?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh ? we share. I meet him on Pine Street after work sometimes."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "When do you see your mother?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "A lot of times. Weekends sometimes I stay over in Charlie Stavros's apartment. He has a real gun in his bureau. It's O.K., he has a license. I can't go over there this weekend because they've gone to the Shore."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Where's the shore?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Delight that she is so dumb creases the corners of Nelson's mouth. "In New Jersey. Everybody calls it just the Shore. We used to go to Wildwood sometimes but Dad hated the traffic too much."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's one thing I miss," Jill says, "the smell of the sea. Where I grew up, the town is on a peninsula, with sea on three sides."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hey, shall I make you some French toast? I just learned how."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Jealousy, perhaps, makes Rabbit impatient with this scene: his son in spite of his smallness bony and dominating and alert, Jill in her sheet looking like one of those cartoon figures, justice or Liberty or Mourning Peace. He goes outside to bring in the Sunday Triumph, sits reading the funnies in the sunshine on the porchlet steps until the bugs get too bad, comes back into the living room and reads at random about the Egyptians, the Phillies, the Onassises. From the kitchen comes sizzling and giggling and whispering. He is in the Garden Section (Scorn not the modest goldenrod, dock, and tansy that grow in carefree profusion in fields and roadside throughout these August days; carefully dried and arranged, they will form attractive bouquets to brighten the winter months around the corner) when the kid comes in with milk on his mustache and, wideeyed, pressingly, with a new kind of energy, asks, "Hey Dad, can she come along on the boat? I've called up Billy and he says his father won't mind, only we have to hurry up. You can come too."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Maybe I mind."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Dad. Don't." And Harry reads his son's taut face to mean, She can hear. She's all alone. We must be nice to her, we must be nice to the poor, the weak, the black. Love is here to stay.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Monday, Rabbit is setting the Vat front page. WIDOW, SIXTY?SEVEN, RAPED AND ROBBED. Three Black Youths Held.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Police authorities revealed Saturday that they are holding for questioning two black minors and Wendell Phillips, 19, of 42B Plum Street, in connection with the brutal assault of an unidentified sywsfyz kmlhs the brutal assault of an unidentified elderly white woman late Thursday night.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The conscienceless crime, the latest in a series of similar incidents in the Third Ward, aroused residents of the neighborhood to organize a committee of protest which appeared before Friday's City Council session.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nobody Safe
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nobody's safe on the st
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nobody's safe on the streets any more," said committee spokesman Bernard Vogel to VAT reporters.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nobody's safe not even in our own homes."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Through the clatter Harry feels a tap on his shoulder and looks around. Pajasek, looking worried. "Angstrom, telephone."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Who the hell?" He feels obliged to say this, as apology for being called at work, on Verity time.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "A woman," Pajasek says, not placated.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Who? Jill (last night her hair still damp from the boat ride tickled his belly as she managed to make him come) was in trouble. They had kidnapped her ?the police, the blacks. Or Peggy Fosnacht was calling up to offer supper again. Or his mother had taken a turn for the worse and with her last heartbeats had dialled this number. He is not surprised she would want to speak to him instead of his father, he has never doubted she loves him most. The phone is in Pajasek's little office, three walls of frosted glass, on the desk with the parts catalogues (these old Mergenthalers are always breaking down) and the spindled dead copy. "Hello?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hi, sweetie. Guess who."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> ` Janice. How was the Shore?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Crowded and muggy. How was it here?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Pretty good."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "So I hear. I hear you went out in a boat."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah, it was the kid's idea, he got me invited by Ollie. We went up the river as far as Eifert's Island. We didn't catch much, the state put some trout in but I guess the river's still too full of coal silt. My nose is so sunburned I can't touch it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I hear you had a lot of people in the boat."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nine or so. Ollie runs around with this musical crowd. We had a picnic up at the old camp meeting ground, near Stogey's Quarry, you know, where that witch lived so many years. Ollie's friends all got out guitars and played. It was nice."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I hear you brought a guest too."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Who'd you hear that from?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Peggy told me. Billy told her. He was all turned?on about it, he said Nelson brought a girlfriend."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Beats a mini?bike, huh?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Harry, I don't find this amusing. Where did you find this girl?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Uh, she's a go?go dancer in here at the shop. For the lunch hour. The union demands it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Mere, Harry?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Her weary dismissive insistence pleases him. She is growing in confidence, like a child at school. He confesses, "I sort of picked her up in a bar."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well. That's being honest. How long is she going to stay?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I haven't asked. These kids don't make plans the way we used to, they aren't so scared of starving. Hey, I got to get back to the machine. Pajasek doesn't like our being called here, by the way."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't intend to make a practice of it. I called you at work because I didn't want Nelson to overhear. Harry, now are you listening to me?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Sure, to who else?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I want that girl out of my home. I don't want Nelson exposed to this sort of thing."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What sort of thing? You mean the you and Stavros sort of thing?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Charlie is a mature man. He has lots of nieces and nephews so he's very understanding with Nelson. This girl sounds like a little animal out of her head with dope."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's how Billy described her?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "After she talked to Billy Peggy called up Ollie for a better description."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And that was his description. Gee. They got along famously at the time. She was better?looking than those two old crows Ollie had along, I tell ya."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Harry, you're horrible. I consider this a very negative development. I suppose I have no right to say anything about how you dispose ofyour sexual needs, but I will not have my son corrupted."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He's not corrupted, she's got him to help with the dishes, that's more than we could ever do. She's like a sister to him."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And what is she to you, Harry?" When he is slow to answer, she repeats, her voice taunting, aching, like her mother's, "Harry, what is she to you? A little wifey?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He thinks and tells her, "Come on back to the house, I'm sure she'll go."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Now Janice thinks. Finally she states: "If I come back to the house, it'll be to take Nelson away."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Try it," he says, and hangs up.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He sits a minute in Pajasek's chair to give the phone a chance to ring. It does. He picks it up. "Yeah?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice says, near tears, "Harry, I don't like to tell you this, but if you'd been adequate I would never have left. You drove me to it. I didn't know what I was missing but now that I have it I know. I refuse to accept all the blame, I really do."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "O.K. No blame assigned. Let's keep in touch."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I want that girl away from my son."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "They're getting along fine, relax."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'll sue you. I'll take you to court."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Fine. After the stunts you've been pulling, it'll at least give the judge a laugh."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's my house legally. At least half of it is."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Tell me which my half is, and l'll try to keep Jill in it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice hangs up. Maybe using Jill's name had hurt. He doesn't wait for another ring this time, and leaves the cubicle of frosted glass. The trembling in his hands, which feel frightened and inflated, merges with the clatter of the machines; his body sweat is lost in the smell of oil and ink. He resettles himself at his Mergenthaler and garbles three lines before he can put her phone call in the back of his mind. He supposes Stavros can get her legal advice. But, far from feeling Stavros as one of the enemy camp, he counts on him to keep this madwoman, his wife, under control. Through her body, they have become brothers.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Jill through the succession of nights adjusts Rabbit's body to hers. He cannot overcome his fear of using her body as a woman's her cunt stings, is part of it; he never forces his way into her without remembering those razor blades ?but she, beginning the damp?haired night after the boat ride, perfects ways with her fingers and mouth to bring him off. Small curdled puddles of his semen then appear on her skin, and though easily wiped away leave in his imagination a mark like an acid?bum on her shoulders, her throat, the small of her back; he has the vision of her entire slender fair flexible body being eventually covered with these invisible burns, like a napalmed child in the newspapers. And he, on his side, attempting with hands or mouth to reciprocate, is politely dissuaded, pushed away, reassured she has already come, serving him, or merely asked for the mute pressure of a thigh between hers and, after some few minutes during which he can detect no spasm of relief, thanked. The August nights are sticky and close; when they lie on their backs the ceiling of heavy air seems a foot above their faces. A car, loud on the soft tar and loose gravel, slides by. A mile away across the river a police siren bleats, a new sound, more frantic than the old rising and falling cry. Nelson turns on a light, makes water, flushes the toilet, turns out the light with a snap close to their ears. Had he been listening? Could he even be watching? Jill's breath saws in her throat. She is asleep.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He finds her when he comes back from work sitting and reading, sitting and sewing, sitting and playing Monopoly with Nelson. Her books are spooky: yoga, psychiatry, zen, plucked from racks at the Acme. Except to shop, she reluctantly goes outdoors, even at night. It is not so much that the police of several states are looking for her ? they are looking as well for thousands like her ? as that the light of common day, and the sights and streets that have been the food of Rabbit's life, seem to nauseate her. They rarely watch television, since she leaves the room when they turn the set on, though when she's in the kitchen he sometimes sneaks himself a dose of six?o'clock news. Instead, in the evenings, she and Nelson discuss God, beauty, meaning.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Whatever men make," she says, "what they felt when they made it is there. If it was made to make money, it will smell of money. That's why these houses are so ugly, all the corners they cut to make a profit are still in them. That's why the cathedrals are so lovely; nobles and ladies in velvet and ermine dragged the stones up the ramps. Think of a painter. He stands in front of the canvas with a color on his brush. Whatever he feels when he makes the mark ?if he's tired or bored or happy and proud ? will be there. The same color, but we'll feel it. Like fingerprints. Like handwriting. Man is a means for turning things into spirit and turning spirit into things."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What's the point?" Nelson asks.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "The point is ecstasy," she says. "Energy. Anything that is good is in ecstasy. The world is what God made and it doesn't stink of money, it's never tired, too much or too little, it's always exactly full. The second after an earthquake, the stones are calm. Everywhere is play, even in thunder or an avalanche. Out on my father's boat I used to look up at the stars and there seemed to be invisible strings between them, tuned absolutely right, playing thousands of notes I could almost hear."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why can't we hear them?" Nelson asks.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Because our egos make us deaf. Our egos make us blind. Whenever we think about ourselves, it's like putting a piece of dirt in our eye."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "There's that thing in the Bible."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's what He meant. Without our egos the universe would be absolutely clean, all the animals and rocks and spiders and moon?rocks and stars and grains of sand absolutely doing their thing, unself?consciously. The only consciousness would be God's. Think of it, Nelson, like this: matter is the mirror of spirit. But it's three?dimensional, like an enormous room, a ballroom. And inside it are these tiny other mirrors tilted this way and that and throwing the light back the wrong way. Because to the big face looking in, these little mirrors are just dark spots, where He can't see Himself."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit is entranced to hear her going on like this. Her voice, laconic and dry normally, moves through her sentences as through a memorized recitation, pitched low, an underground murmur. She and Nelson are sitting on the floor with the Monopoly board between them, houses and hotels and money, the game has been going on for days. Neither gives any sign of knowing he has come into the room and is towering above them. Rabbit asks, "Why ?doesn't He just do away with the spots then? I take it the spots are us."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Jill looks up, her face blank as a mirror in this instant. Remembering last night, he expects her to look burned around the mouth; it had been like filling a slippery narrow?mouthed pitcher from an uncontrollable faucet. She answers, "I'm not sure He's noticed us yet. The cosmos is so large and our portion of it so small. So small and recent."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Maybe we'll do the erasing ourselves," Rabbit offers helpfiilly. He wants to help, to hold his end up. Never too late for education. With Janice and old man Springer you could never have this kind of conversation.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "There is that death?wish," Jill concedes.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson will talk only to her. "Do you believe in life on other planets? I don't."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why Nelson, how ungenerous of you! Why not?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't know, it's silly to say -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Say it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I was thinking, if there was life on other planets, they would have killed our moon men when they stepped out of the space ship. But they didn't, so there isn't."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't be dumb," Rabbit says. "The moon is right down our block. We're talking about life in systems millions of light years away."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No, I think the moon was a good test," Jill says. "If nobody bothered to defend it, it proves how little God is content with. Miles and miles of gray dust."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson says, "One guy at school I know says there's people on the moon but they're smaller than atoms, so even when they grind the rocks up they won't find them. He says they have whole cities and everything. We breathe them in through our nostrils and they make us think we see flying saucers. That's what this one guy says."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I myself," Rabbit says, still offering, drawing upon an old Vat feature article he set, "have some hopes for the inside of Jupiter. It's gas, you know, the surface we see. A couple of thousand miles down inside the skin there might be a mix of chemicals that could support a kind of life, something like fish."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's your Puritan fear of waste makes you want that," Jill tells him. "You think the other planets must be used for something, must be farmed. Why? Maybe the planets were put there just to teach men how to count up to seven."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why not just give us seven toes on each foot?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "A kid at school," Nelson volunteers, "was born with an extra finger. The doctor cut it off but you can still see where it was."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Also," Jill says, "astronomy. Without the planets the night sky would have been one rigid thing, and we would never have guessed at the third dimension."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Pretty thoughtful of God," Rabbit says, "if we're just some specks in His mirror."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Jill waves his point away blithely. "He does everything," she says, "by the way. Not because it's what He has to do."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She can be blithe. After he told her once she ought to go outdoors more, she went out and sunbathed in just her bikini underpants, on a blanket beside the barbecue, in the view of a dozen other houses. When a neighbor called up to complain, Jill justified herself, "My tits are so small, I thought they'd think I was a boy." Then after Harry began giving her thirty dollars a week to shop with, she went and redeemed her Porsche from the police. Its garage parking fees had quadrupled the original fine. She gave her address as Vista Crescent and said she was staying the summer with her uncle. "It's a nuisance," she told Rabbit, "but Nelson ought to have a car around, at his age, it's too humiliating not to. Everybody in America has a car except you." So the Porsche came to live by their curb. Its white is dusty and the passenger?side front fender is scraped and one convertible top snap is broken. Nelson loves it so much he nearly cries, finding it there each morning. He washes it. He reads the manual and rotates the tires. That crystalline week before school begins, Jill takes him for drives out into the country, into the farmland and the mountains of Brewer County; she is teaching him how to drive.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Some days they return after Rabbit is home an hour from work. "Dad, it was a blast. We drove way up into this mountain that's a hawk refuge and Jill let me take the wheel on the twisty road coming down, all the way to the highway. Have you ever heard of shifting down?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I do it all the time."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's when you go into a lower gear instead of braking. It feels neat. Jill's Porsche has about five gears and you can really zoom around curves because the center of gravity is so low."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit asks Jill, "You sure you're handling this right? The kid might kill somebody. I don't want to be sued."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He's very competent. And responsible. He must get that from you. I used to stay in the driver's seat and let him just steer but that's more dangerous than giving him control. The mountain was really quite deserted."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Except for hawks, Dad. They sit on all these pine trees waiting for the guys to put out whole carcasses of cows and things. It's really grungy."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well," Rabbit says, "hawks got to live too."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's what I keep telling him," Jill says. "God is in the tiger as well as in the lamb."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah. God really likes to chew himself up."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You know what you are?" Jill asks, her eyes the green of a meadow, her hair a finespun cedar?colored tangle dissolving into windowlight; a captured idea is fluttering in her head. "You are cynical."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> `Just middle?aged. Somebody came up to me and said, `I'm God,' I'd say, `Show me your badge.' "
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Jill dances forward, on fire with some fun and wickedness the day has left in her, and gives him a hug that dances off, a butterfly hug. "I think you're beautiful. Nelson and I both think so. We often talk about it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You do? That's the only thing you can think of to do, talk about me?" He means to be funny, to keep her mood alive, but her face stops, hovers a second; and Nelson's tells him he has struck on something. What they do. In that little car. Well, they don't need much space, much contact: young bodies. The kid's faint mustache, black hairs; her cedar mane. Bodies not sodden yet like his. At that keen age the merest touch. Their brother?sister shyness, touching hands in the flicker of wet glass at the sink. If she'd offer to lay hairy old heavy him the first night, what wouldn't she do to bring the kid along; somebody has to. Why not? Chief question facing these troubled times. Why not.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Though he doesn't pursue this guilt he has startled from her, that night he does make her take him squarely, socks it into her, though she offers her mouth and her cunt is so tight it sears. She is frightened when he doesn't lose his hardness; he makes her sit up on him and pulls her satin hips down, the pelvis bones starved, and she sucks in breath sharply and out of pained astonishment pitched like delight utters, "You're wombing me!" He tries to picture it. A rosy?black floor in her somewhere, never knows where he is, in among kidneys, intestines, liver. His child bride with flesh?colored hair and cloudy innards floats upon him, stings him, sucks him up like a cloud, falls, forgives him. His love of her coats him with distaste and confusion, so that he quickly sleeps, only his first dreams jostled when she gets from bed to go wash, check on Nelson, talk to God, take a pill, whatever else she needs to do to heal the wound where his seared cock was. How sad, how strange. We make companions out of air and hurt them, so they will defy us, completing creation.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry's father sidles up to him at the coffee break. "How's every little thing, Harry?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not bad."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I hate like hell to nag like this, you're a grown man with your own miseries, I know that, but I'd be appreciative as hell if you'd come over some evenings and talk to your mother. She hears all sorts of malicious folderol about you and Janice now, and it would help settle her down if you could put her straight. We're no moralists, Harry, you know that; your mother and I tried to live by our own lights and to raise the two children God was good enough to give us by those same lights, but I know damn well it's a different world now, so we're no moralists, me and Mary."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How is her health, generally?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well, that's another of these problematical things, Harry. They've gone ahead and put her on this new miracle drug, they have some name for it I can never remember, L?dopa, that's right, L?dopa, it's still in the experimental stage I guess, but there's no doubt in a lot of cases it works wonders. Trouble is, also it has these side effects they don't know too much about, depression in your mother's case, some nausea and lack of appetite; and nightmares, Harry, nightmares that wake her up and she wakes me up so I can hear her heart beating, beating like a tom?tom. I never heard that before, Harry, another person's heart in the room as clear as footsteps, but that's what these L?dopa dreams do for her. But there's no doubt, her talk comes easier, and her hands don't shake that way they have so much. It's hard to know what's right, Harry. Sometimes you think, Let Nature take its course, but then you wonder, What's Nature and what isn't? Another side effect" ? he draws closer, glancing around and then glancing down as his coffee slops in the paper cup and burns his fingers ? "I shouldn't mention it but it tickles me, your mother says this new stuff she's taking, whatever you call it, makes her feel, how shall I say?" ? he glances around again, then confides to his son ?"lovey?dovey. Here she is, just turned sixty?five, lying in bed half the day, and gets these impulses so bad she says she can hardly stand it, she says she won't watch television, the commercials make it worse. She says she has to laugh at herself. Now isn't that a helluva thing? A good woman like that. I'm sorry to talk your ear off I live alone with it too much, I suppose, what with Mim on the other side of the country. Christ knows it isn't as if you don't have your problems too."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't have any problems," Rabbit tells him. "Right now I'm just holding my breath to when the kid gets back into school. His state of mind's pretty well stabilized, I'd say. One of the reasons, you know, I don't make it over to Mt. Judge as often as I should, Mom was pretty rough on Nelson when he was little and the kid is still scared of her. On the other hand I don't like to leave him alone in the house, with all these robberies and assaults all over the county, they come out into the suburbs and steal anything they can get their hands on. I was just setting an item, some woman over in Perley Township, they stole her vacuum cleaner and a hundred feet of garden hose while she was upstairs going to the bathroom."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's these God, damn, blacks, is what it is." Earl Angstrom lowers his voice so it turns husky, though Buchanan and Farnsworth always take their coffee break outside in the alley, with Boonie and the other drinkers. "I've always called'em black and they call themselves blacks now and that suits me fine. They can't do a white man's job, except for a few, and take even Buck, he's never made head of makeup though he's been here the longest; so they have to rob and kill, the ones that can't be pimps and prizefighters. They can't cut the mustard and never could. This country should have taken whosever advice it was, George Washington if memory serves, one of the founding fathers, and shipped 'em all back to Africa when we had a chance. Now, Africa wouldn't take 'em. Booze and Cadillacs and white pussy, if you'll pardon my saying so, have spoiled 'em rotten. They're the garbage of the world, Harry. American Negroes are the lowest of the low. They steal and then they have the nerve to say the country owes it to 'em."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "O.K., O.K." To see his father passionate about anything disagrees with Rabbit. He shifts to the most sobering subject they have between them: "Does she mention me much? Mom."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The old man licks spittle from his lips, sighs, slumps confidingly lower, glancing down at the cooled scummed coffee in his hands. "All the time, Harry, every minute of the day. They tell her things about you and she raves against the Springers; oh, how she carries on about that family, especially the women of it. Apparently, the Mrs. is saying you've taken up with a hippie teenager, that's what drove Janice out of the house in the first place."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No, Janice went first. I keep inviting her back."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well, whatever the actualities of the case are, I know you're trying to do the right thing. I'm no moralist, Harry, I know you young people nowadays have more tensions and psychological pressures than a man my age could tolerate. If I'd of had the atomic bomb and these rich?kid revolutionaries to worry about, I'd no doubt just have put a shotgun to my head and let the world roll on without me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'll try to get over. I ought to talk to her," Rabbit says. He looks past his father's shoulder to where the yellow?faced wall clock jumps to within a minute of 11:10, the end of the coffee break. He knows that in all this rolling?on world his mother is the only person who knows him. He remembers from the night we touched the moon the nudge delivered out of her dying, but doesn't want to open himself to her until he understands what is happening inside him enough to protect it. She has something happening to her, death and L?dopa, and he has something happening to him, Jill. The girl has been living with them three weeks and is learning to keep house and to give him a wry silent look saying I know you when he offers to argue about Communism or kids today or any of the other sore spots where he feels rot beginning and black madness creeping in. A little wry green look that began the night he hurt her upwards and touched her womb.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> His father is more with him than he suspects, for the old man draws still closer and says, "One thing it's been on my mind to say, Harry, forgive me talking out of turn, but I hope you're taking all the precautions, knock up one of these minors, the law takes a very dim view. Also, they say they're dirty as weasels and giving everybody the clap." Absurdly, as the clock ticks the last minute and the end?of?break bell rasps, the old man claps.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> In his clean crisp after?work shirt he opens the front door of the apple?green house and hears guitar music from above. Guitar chords slowly plucked, and two high small voices moving through a melody. He is drawn upstairs. In Nelson's room, the two are sitting on the bed, Jill up by the pillows in a yoga position that displays the crotch of her black lace underpants. A guitar is cradled across her thighs. Rabbit has never seen the guitar before; it looks new. The pale wood shines like a woman oiled after a bath. Nelson sits beside Jill in Jockey shorts and T?shirt, craning his neck to read from the sheet of music on the bedspread by her ankles. The boy's legs, dangling to the floor, look suddenly sinewy, long, beginning to be shaded with Janice's dark hair, and Rabbit notices that the old posters of Brooks Robinson and Orlando Cepeda and Steve McQueen on a motorcycle have been removed from the boy's walls. Paint has flaked where the Scotch tape was. They are singing, ". . . must a man wa?alk down"; the delicate thread breaks when he enters, though they must have heard his footsteps on the stairs as warning. The kid's being in his underclothes is O.K.: far from dirty as a weasel, Jill has gotten Nelson to take a shower once a day, before his father's homecoming, perhaps because her own father came home to Stonington only on Fridays and deserved a ceremony.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hey, Dad," Nelson says, "this is neat. We're singing harmony." "Where did you get the guitar?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "We hustled."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Jill nudges the boy with a bare foot, but not quick enough to halt the remark.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit asks him, "How do you hustle?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "We stood on streetcorners in Brewer, mostly at Weiser and Seventh, but then we moved over to Cameron when a pig car slowed down to look us over. It was a gas, Dad. Jill would stop these people and tell 'em I was her brother, our mother was dying of cancer and our father had lit out, and we had a baby brother at home. Sometimes she said a baby sister. Some of the people said we should apply to welfare, but enough gave us a dollar or so so finally we had the twenty dollars Ollie promised was all he'd charge us for a forty?four dollar guitar. And he threw in the music free after Jill talked to him in the back room."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Wasn't that nice of Ollie?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Harry, it really was. Don't look like that."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He says to Nelson, "I wonder what they talked about."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Dad, there was nothing dishonest about it, these people we stopped felt better afterwards, for having got us off their conscience. Anyway, Dad, in a society where power was all to the people money wouldn't exist anyway, you'd just be given what you need."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well hell, that's the way your life is now."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah, but I have to beg for everything, don't I? And I never did get a mini?bike."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nelson, you get some clothes on and stay in your room. I want to talk to Jill a second."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "If you hurt her, l'll kill you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "If you don't shut up, l'll make you live with Mommy and Charlie Stavros."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> In their bedroom, Rabbit carefully closes the door and in a soft shaking voice tells Jill, "You're turning my kid into a beggar and a whore just like yourself," and, after waiting a second for her to enter a rebuttal, slaps her thin disdainful face with its prim lips and its green eyes drenched so dark in defiance their shade is as of tree leaves, a shufing concealing multitude, a microscopic forest he wants to bomb. His slap feels like slapping plastic: stings his fingers, does no good. He slaps her again, gathers the dry flesh of her hair into his hand to hold her face steady, feels cold fury when she buckles and tries to slither away but, after a fist to the side of her neck, lets her drop onto the bed.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Still shielding her face, Jill hisses up at him, strangely hisses out of her little spaced inturned teeth, until her first words come. They are calm and superior. "You know why you did that, you just wanted to hurt me, that's why. You just wanted to have that kick. You don't give a shit about me and Nelson hustling. What do you care about who begs and who doesn't, who steals and who doesn't?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> A blankness in him answers when she asks; but she goes on. "What have the pig laws ever done for you except screw you into a greasy job and turn you into such a gutless creep you can't even keep your idiotic wife?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He takes her wrist. It is fragile. Chalk. He wants to break it, to feel it snap; he wants to hold her absolutely quiet in his arms for the months while it will heal. "Listen. I earn my money one fucking dollar at a time and you're living on it and if you want to go back bumming off your nigger friends, go. Get out. Leave me and my kid alone."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You creep," she says, "you baby?killing creep."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Put another record on," he says. "You sick bitch. You rich kids playing at life make me sick, throwing rocks at the poor dumb cops protecting your daddy's loot. You're just playing, baby. You think you're playing a great game of happy cunt but let me tell you something. My poor dumb mutt of a wife throws a better piece of ass backwards than you can manage frontwards."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Backwards is right, she can't stand facing you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He squeezes her chalk wrist tighter, telling her, "You have no juice, baby. You're all sucked out and you're just eighteen. You've tried everything and you're not scared of nothing and you wonder why it's all so dead. You've had it handed to you, sweet baby, that's why it's so dead. Fucking Christ you think you're going to make the world over you don't have a fucking clue what makes people run. Fear. That's what makes us poor bastards run. You don't know what fear is, do you, poor baby? That's why you're so dead." He squeezes her wrist until he can picture the linked curved bones in it bending ghostly as in an X ray; and her eyes widen a fraction, a hairspace of alarm he can see only because he is putting it there.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She tugs her wrist free and rubs it, not lowering her eyes from his. "People've run on fear long enough," Jill says. "Let's try love for a change."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Then you better find yourself another universe. The moon is cold, baby. Cold and ugly. If you don't want it, the Commies do. They're not so fucking proud."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What's that noise?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> It is Nelson crying, outside the door, afraid to come in. It had been the same way with him and Janice, their fights: just when they were getting something out of them, the kid would beg them to stop. Maybe he imagined that Becky had been killed in just such a quarrel, that this one would kill him. Rabbit lets him in and explains, "We were talking politics."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson squeezes out in the spaces between his sobs. "Daddy, why do you disagree with everybody?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Because I love my country and can't stand to have it knocked."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "If you loved it you'd want it better," Jill says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "If it was better I'd have to be better," he says seriously, and they all laugh, he last.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Thus, through lame laughter ? she still rubs her wrists, the hand he hit her with begins to hurt ? they seek to reconstitute their family. For supper Jill cooks a filet of sole, lemony, light, simmered in sunshine, skin flaky brown; Nelson gets a hamburger with wheatgerm sprinkled on it to remind him of a Nutburger. Wheatgerm, zucchini, water chestnuts, celery salt, Familia: these are some of the exotic items Jill's shopping brings into the house. Her cooking tastes to him of things he never had: candlelight, saltwater, health fads, wealth, class. Jill's family had a servant, and it takes her some nights to understand that dirtied dishes do not clear and clean themselves by magic, but have to be carried and washed. Rabbit, still, Saturday mornings, is the one to vacuum the rooms, to bundle his shirts and the sheets for the laundry, to sort out Nelson's socks and underwear for the washer in the basement. He can see, what these children cannot, dust accumulate, deterioration advance, chaos seep in, time conquer. But for her cooking he is willing to be her servant, part?time. Her cooking has renewed his taste for life. They have wine now with supper, a California white in a half?gallon jug. And always a salad: salad in Diamond County cuisine tends to be a brother of sauerkraut, fat with creamy dressing, but Jill's hands serve lettuce in an oily film invisible as health. Where Janice would for dessert offer some doughy goodie from the Half?A?Loaf, Jill concocts designs of fruit. And her coffee is black nectar compared to the watery tar Janice used to serve. Contentment makes Harry motionless; he watches the dishes be skimmed from the table, and resettles expansively in the living room. When the dishwashing machine is fed and chugging contentedly, Jill comes into the living room, sits on the tacky carpet, and plays the guitar. What does she play? "Farewell, Angelina, the sky is on fire," and a few others she can get through a stanza of. She has maybe six chords. Her fingers on the frets often tighten on strands of her hanging hair; it must hurt. Her voice is a thin instrument that quickly cracks. "All my tri?als, Lord, soon be o?over," she sings, quitting, looking up for applause.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson applauds. Small hands.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Great," Rabbit tells her and, mellow on wine, goes on, in apology for his life, "No kidding, I once took that inner light trip and all I did was bruise my surroundings. Revolution, or whatever, is just a way of saying a mess is fun. Well, it is fun, for a while, as long as somebody else has laid in the supplies. A mess is a luxury, is all I mean."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Jill has been strumming for him, between sentences, part helping him along, part poking fun. He turns on her. "Now you tell us something. You tell us the story of your life."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I've had no life," she says, and strums. "No man's daughter, and no man's wife."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Tell us a story," Nelson begs. From the way she laughs, showing her roundish teeth and letting her thin cheeks go dimply, they see she will comply.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "This is the story of Jill and her lover who was ill," she announces, and releases a chord. It's as if, Rabbit thinks, studying the woman?shape of the guitar, the notes are in there already, waiting to fly from the dovecote of that round hole. "Now Jill," Jill goes on, "was a comely lass, raised in the bosom of the middle class. Her dad and mother each owned a car, and on the hood of one was a Mercedes star. I don't know how much longer I can go on rhyming." She strums quizzically.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't try it," Rabbit advises.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Her upbringing" ? emphasis on the "ging" ? "was orthodox enough ? sailing and dancing classes and francais and all that stuff."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Keep rhyming, Jill," Nelson begs.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Menstruation set in at age fourteen, but even with her braces off Jill was no queen. Her knowledge of boys was confined to boys who played tennis and whose parents with her parents dined. Which suited her perfectly well, since having observed her parents drinking and chatting and getting and spending she was in no great hurry to become old and fat and swell. Ooh, that was a stretch."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't rhyme on my account," Rabbit says. "I'm getting a beer, anybody else want one?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson calls, "I'll share yours, Dad."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Get your own. I'll get it for you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Jill strums to reclaim their attention. "Well, to make a boring story short, one summer" ? she searches ahead for a rhyme, then adds, "after her daddy died."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Uh?oh," Rabbit says, tiptoeing back with two beers.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She met a boy who became her psycho?physical guide."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit pulls his tab and tries to hush the pff.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "His name was Freddy -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He sees there is nothing to do but yank it, which he does so quickly the beer foams through the keyhole.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And the nicest thing about him was that she was ready." Strum. "He had nice brown shoulders from being a lifeguard, and his bathing suit held something sometimes soft and sometimes hard. He came from far away, from romantic Rhode Island across Narragansett Bay."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hey," Rabbit olés.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "The only bad thing was, inside, the nice brown lifeguard had already died. Inside there was an old man with a dreadful need, for pot and hash and LSD and speed." Now her strumming takes a different rhythm, breaking into the middle on the offbeat.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He was a born loser, though his race was white, and he fucked sweet virgin Jill throughout one sandy night. She fell for him" strum ? "and got deep into his bag of being stoned: she freaked out nearly every time the bastard telephoned. She went from popping pills to dropping acid, then" ? she halts and leans forward staring at Nelson so hard the boy softly cries, "Yes?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He lovingly suggested shooting heroin."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson looks as if he will cry: the way his eyes sink in and his chin develops another bump. He looks, Rabbit thinks, like a sulky girl. He can't see much of himself in the boy, beyond the small straight nose.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The music runs on.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Poor Jill got scared; the other kids at school would tell her not to be a self?destructive fool. Her mother, still in mourning, was being kept bus?ee, by a divorced tax lawyer from nearby Westerlee. Bad Freddy was promising her Heaven above, when all Jill wanted was his mundane love. She wanted the feel of his prick, not the prick of the needle; but Freddy would beg her, and stroke her, and sweet?talk and wheedle."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> And Rabbit begins to wonder if she has done this before, that rhyme was so slick. What hasn't this kid done before?
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She was afraid to die" ? strum, strum, pale orange hair thrashing ? "he asked her why. He said the world was rotten and insane; she said she had no cause to complain. He said racism was rampant, hold out your arm; she said no white man but him had ever done her any harm. He said the first shot will just be beneath the skin; she said okay, lover, put that shit right in." Strum strum strum. Face lifted toward them, she is a banshee, totally bled. She speaks the next line. "It was hell."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> St?r?r?um. "He kept holding her head and patting her ass, and saying relax, he'd been to life?saving class. He asked her, hadn't he shown her the face of God? She said, Yes, thank you, but she would have been happy to settle for less. She saw that her lover with his tan skin and white smile was death; she feared him and loved him with every frightened breath. So what did Jill do?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Silence hangs on the upbeat.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson blurts, "What?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Jill smiles. "She ran to the Stonington savings bank and generously withdrew. She hopped inside her Porsche and drove away, and that is how come she is living with you two creeps today."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Both father and son applaud. Jill drinks deep of the beer as a reward to herself. In their bedroom, she is still in the mood, artistic elation, to be rewarded. Rabbit says to her, "Great song. But you know what I didn't like about it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nostalgia. You miss it. Getting stoned with Freddy."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "At least," she says, "I wasn't just playing, what did you call it, happy cunt?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Sorry I blew my stack."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Still want me to go?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit, having sensed this would come, hangs up his pants, his shirt, puts his underclothes in the hamper. The dress she has dropped on the floor he drapes on a hook in her half of the closet, her dirty panties he puts in the hamper. "No. Stay."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Beg me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He turns, a big tired man, slack?muscled, who has to rise and set type in eight hours. "I beg you to stay."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Take back those slaps."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How can I?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Kiss my feet."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He kneels to comply. Annoyed at such ready compliance, which implies pleasure, she stiffens her feet and kicks so her toenails stab his cheek, dangerously near his eyes. He pins her ankles to continue his kissing. Slightly doughy, matronly ankles. Green veins on her insteps. Nice remembered locker room taste. Vanilla going rancid.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Your tongue between my toes," she says; her voice cracks timidly, issuing the command. When again he complies, she edges forward on the bed and spreads her legs. "Now here." She knows he enjoys this, but asks it anyway, to see what she can make of him, this alien man. His head, with its stubborn old?fashioned short haircut ? the enemy's uniform, athlete and soldier; bone above the ears, dingy blond silk thinning on top ? feels large as a boulder between her thighs. The excitement of singing her song, ebbing, unites with the insistent warmth of his tongue lapping. A spark kindles, a green sprig lengthens in the barren space between her legs. "A little higher," Jill says, then, her voice quite softened and crumbling, "Faster. Lovely. Lovely."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> One day after work as he and his father are walking down Pine Street toward their before?bus drink at the Phoenix Bar, a dapper thickset man with sideburns and hornrims intercepts them. "Hey, Angstrom." Both father and son halt, blink. In the tunnel of sunshine, after their day of work, they generally feel hidden.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry recognizes Stavros. He is wearing a suit of little beige checks on a ground of greenish threads. He looks a touch thinner, more brittle, his composure more of an effort. Maybe he is just tense for this encounter. Harry says, "Dad, I'd like you to meet a friend of mine. Charlie Stavros, Earl Angstrom."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Pleased to meet you, Earl."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The old man ignores the extended square hand and speaks to Harry. "Not the same that's ruined my daughter?in?law?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Stavros tries for a quick sale. "Ruined. That's pretty strong. Humored is more how I'd put it." His try for a smile ignored, Stavros turns to Harry. "Can we talk a minute? Maybe have a drink down at the corner. Sorry to butt in like this, Mr. Angstrom."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Harry, what is your preference? You want to be left alone with this scum or shall we brush him off?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Come on, Dad, what's the point?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You young people may have your own ways of working things out, but I'm too old to change. I'll get on the next bus. Don't let yourself be talked into anything. This son of a bitch looks slick."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Give my love to Mom. I'll try to get over this weekend."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "If you can, you can. She keeps dreaming about you and Mim."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah, some time could you give me Mim's address?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She doesn't have an address, just care of some agent in Los Angeles, that's the way they do it now. You were thinking of writing her?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Maybe send her a postcard. See you tomorrow."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Terrible dreams," the old man says, and slopes to the curb to wait for the 16A bus, cheated of his beer, the thin disappointed back of his neck reminding Harry of Nelson.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Inside the Phoenix it is dark and cold; Rabbit feels a sneeze gathering between his eyes. Stavros leads the way to a booth and folds his hands on the Formica tabletop. Hairy hands that have held her breasts. Harry asks, "How is she?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She? Oh hell, in fine form."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit wonders if this means what it seems. The tip of his tongue freezes on his palate, unable to think of a delicate way to probe. He says, "They don't have a waitress in the afternoon. I'll get a Daiquiri for myself, what for you?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Just soda water. Lots of ice."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No hootch?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Never touch it." Stavros clears his throat, smooths back the hair above his sideburns with a flat hand that is, nevertheless, slightly trembling. He explains, "The medicos tell me it's a no?no."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Coming back with their drinks, Rabbit asks, "You sick?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Stavros says, "Nothing new, the same old ticker. Janice must have told you, heart murmur since I was a kid."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> What does this guy think, he and Janice sat around discussing him like he was their favorite child? He does remember Janice crying out he couldn't marry, expecting him, Harry, her husband, to sympathize. Oddly, he had. "She mentioned something."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Rheumatic fever. Thank God they've got those things licked now, when I was a kid I caught every bug they made." Stavros shrugs. "They tell me I can live to be a hundred, if I take care of the physical plant. You know," he says, "these doctors. There's still a lot they don't know."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I know. They're putting my mother through the wringer right now."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Jesus, you ought to hear Janice go on about your mother."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not so enthusiastic, huh?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not so at all. She needs some gripe, though, to keep herself justified. She's all torn up about the kid."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She left him with me and there he stays."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "In court, you know, you'd lose him."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "We'd see."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Stavros makes a small chopping motion around his glass full of soda bubbles (poor Peggy Fosnacht; Rabbit should call her) to indicate a new angle in their conversation. "Hell," he says, "I can't take him in. I don't have the room. As it is now, I have to send Janice out to the movies or over to her parents when my family visits. You know I just don't have a mother, I have a grandmother. She's ninety?three, speaking of living forever."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit tries to imagine Stavros's room, which Janice described as full of tinted photographs, and instead imagines Janice nude, tinted, Playmate of the month, posed on a nappy Greek sofa olive green in color, with scrolling arms, her body twisted at the hips just enough to hide her gorgeous big black bush. The crease of the centerfold cuts across her navel and one hand dangles a rose. The vision makes Rabbit for the first time hostile. He asks Stavros, "How do you see this all coming out?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's what I wanted to ask you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit asks, "She going sour on you?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No, Jesus, au contraire. She's balling me ragged."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit sips, swallows that, probes for another nerve. "She miss the kid?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nelson, he comes over to the lot some days and she sees him weekends anyhow, I don't know that she saw much more of him before. I don't know as how motherhood is Janice's best bag anyway. What she doesn't much care for is the idea of her baby just out of diapers shacking up with this hippie."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She's not a hippie, especially; unless everybody that age is. And I'm the one shacking up."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How is she at it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She's balling me ragged," Rabbit tells him. He is beginning to get Stavros's measure. At first, meeting him on the street so suddenly, he felt toward him like a friend, met through Janice's body. Then first coming into the Phoenix he felt him as a sick man, a man holding himself together against odds. Now he sees him as a competitor, one of those brainy cute close?set little playmakers. O.K. So Rabbit is competing again. What he has to do is hang loose and let Stavros make the move.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Stavros hunches his square shoulders infinitesimally, has some soda, and asks, "What do you see yourself doing with this hippie?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She has a name. Jill."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What's Jill's big picture, do you know?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No. She has a dead father and a mother she doesn't like, I guess she'll go back to Connecticut when her luck runs thin."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Aren't you being, so to speak, her luck?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'm part of her picture right now, yeah."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And she of yours. You know, your living with this girl gives Janice an open?and?shut divorce case."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You don't scare me, somehow."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Do I understand that you've assured Janice that all she has to do is come back and the girl will go?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit begins to feel it, where Stavros is pressing for the opening. The tickle above his nose is beginning up again. "No," he says, praying not to sneeze, "you don't understand that." He sneezes. Six faces at the bar look around; the little Schlitz spinner seems to hesitate. They are giving away refrigerators and ski weekends in Chile on the TV.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You don't want Janice back now?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't know."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You would like a divorce so you can keep living the good life? Or marry the girl, maybe, even? Jill. She'll break your balls, Sport."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You think too fast. I'm just living day by day, trying to forget my sorrow. I've been left, don't forget. Some slick?talking kinkyhaired peacenik?type Japanese?car salesman lured her away, I forget the son?of?a?bitch's name."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That isn't exactly the way it was. She came pounding on my door."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You let her in."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Stavros looks surprised. "What else? She had put herself out on a limb. Where could she go? My taking her in made the least trouble for everybody."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And now it's trouble?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Stavros fiddles his fingertips as if cards are in them; if he loses this trick, can he take the rest? "Her staying on with me gives her expectations we can't fulfill. Marriage isn't my thing, sorry. With anybody."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't try to be polite. So now you've tried her in all positions and want to ship her back. Poor old Jan. So dumb."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't find her dumb. I find her?unsure of herself She wants what every normal chick wants. To be Helen of Troy. There've been hours when I gave her some of that. I can't keep giving it to her. It doesn't hold up." He becomes angry; his square brow darkens. "What do you want? You're sitting there twitching your whiskers, so how about it? If I kick her out, will you pick her up?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Kick her out and see. She can always go live with her parents."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Her mother drives her crazy."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's what mothers are for." Rabbit pictures his own. His bladder gets a touch of that guilty sweetness it had when as a child he was running to school late, beside the slime?rimmed gutter water that ran down from the ice plant. He tries to explain. "Listen, Stavros. You're the one in the wrong. You're the one screwing another man's wife. If you want to pull out, pull out. Don't try to commit me to one of your fucking coalition governments."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Back to that," Stavros says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Right. You intervened, not me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I didn't intervene, I performed a rescue."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's what all you hawks say." He is eager to argue about Vietnam, but Stavros keeps to the less passionate subject.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She was desperate, fella. Christ, hadn't you taken her to bed in ten years?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I resent that."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Go ahead. Resent it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She was no worse off than a million wives." A billion cunts, how many wives? Five hundred million? "We had relations. They didn't seem so bad to me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "All I'm saying is, I didn't cook this up, it was delivered to me hot. I didn't have to talk her into anything, she was pushing all the way. I was the first chance she had. If I'd been a one?legged milkman, I would have done."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You're too modest."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Stavros shakes his head. "She's some tiger."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Stop it, you're giving me a hard?on."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Stavros studies him squarely. "You're a funny guy."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Tell me what it is you don't like about her now."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> His merely interested tone relaxes Stavros's shoulders an inch. The man measures off a little cage in front of his lapels. "It's just too ? confining. It's weight I don't need. I got to keep light, on an even keel. I got to avoid stress. Between you and me, I'm not going to live forever."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You just told me you might."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "The odds are not."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You know, you're just like me, the way I used to be. Everybody now is like the way I used to be."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She's had her kicks for the summer, let her come back. Tell the hippie to move on, that's what a kid like that wants to hear anyway."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit sips the dregs of his second Daiquiri. It is delicious, to let this silence lengthen, widen: he will not promise to take Janice back. The game is on ice. He says at last, because continued silence would have been unbearably rude, ` Just don't know. Sorry to be so vague."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Stavros takes it up quickly. "She on anything?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Who?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "This nympho of yours."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "On something?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You know. Pills. Acid. She can't be on horse or you wouldn'have any furniture left."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> ` Jill? No, she's kicked that stuff:"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't you believe it. They never do. These flower babies dope is their milk."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She's fanatic against. She's been there and back. Not that this is any of your business." Rabbit doesn't like the way the game has started to slide; there is a hole he is trying to plug and can't.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Stavros minutely shrugs. "How about Nelson? Is he acting different?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He's growing up." The answer sounds evasive. Stavros brushes it aside.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Drowsy? Nervous? Taking naps at odd times? What do they do all day while you're playing hunt and peck? They must do something, fella."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She teaches him how to be polite to scum. Fella. Let me pay ?for your water."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "So what have I learned?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I hope nothing."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> But Stavros has sneaked in for that lay?up and the game is in overtime. Rabbit hurries to get home, to see Nelson and Jill, to sniff their breaths, look at their pupils, whatever. He has left his lamb with a viper. But outside the Phoenix, in the hazed sunshine held at its September tilt, traffic is snarled, and the buses are caught along with everything else. A movie is being made. Rabbit remembers it mentioned in the Vat (BREWER MIDDLE AMERICA? Gotham Filmmakers Think So) that Brewer had been chosen for a location by some new independent outfit; none of the stars' names meant anything to him, he forgot the details. Here they are. An arc of cars and trucks mounted with lights extends halfway into Weiser Street, and a crowd of locals with rolled?up shirtsleeves and bag?lugging grannies and Negro delinquents straggles into the rest of the street to get a closer look, cutting down traffic to one creeping lane. The cops that should be unsnarling the tangle are ringing the show, protecting the moviemakers. So tall, Rabbit gets a glimpse from a curb. One of the boarded?up stores near the old Baghdad that used to show M?G?M but now is given over to skin flicks (Sepia Follies, Honeymoon in Swapland ) has been done up as a restaurant front; a tall salmon?faced man with taffy hair and a little bronze?haired trick emerge from this pretend?restaurant arm in arm and there is some incident involving a passerby, another painted actor who emerges from the crowd of dusty real people watching, a bumping?into, followed by laughter on the part of the first man and the woman and a slow resuming look that will probably signal when the film is all cut and projected that they are going to fuck. They do this several times. Between takes everybody waits, wisecracks, adjusts lights and wires. The girl, from Rabbit's distance, is impossibly precise: her eyes flash, her hair hurls reflections like a helmet. Even her dress scintillates. When someone, a director or electrician, stands near her, he looks dim. And it makes Rabbit feel dim, dim and guilty, to see how the spotlights carve from the sunlight a yet brighter day, a lurid pastel island of heightened reality around which the rest of us ? technicians, policemen, the straggling fascinated spectators including himselfare penumbral ghosts, suppliants ignored.

<br> As Brewer renews itself, it discovers more about itself.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The large?scale demolition and reconstruction now taking place in the central city continues uncovering numerous artifacts of the "olden times" which yield interesting insights into our city's past.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> An underground speakeasy complete with wall murals emerged to light during the creation of a parking lot at M ing the creation of a parking lot at Muriel and Greeley Streets.

<br> Old?timers remembered the hideaway as the haunt of "Gloves" Naugel and other Prohibition figures, as also the training?ground for musicians like "Red" Wenrich of sliding trombone fame who went on to become household names on a nationwide scale.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Also old sign?boards are common. Ingeniously shaped in the forms of cows, beehives, boots, mortars, plows, they advertise "dry goods and notions," leatherwork, drugs, and medicines, produce of infinite variety. Preserved underground, most are still easily legible and date from the nineteenth century.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Amid the old fieldstone foundations, metal tools and grindstones come to light.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Arrowheads are not uncommon.

<br> Dr. Klaus Schoerner, vice?president of the Brewer Historical Society, spent a

<br> 
<br> At the coffee break, Buchanan struts up to Rabbit. "How's little Jilly doing for you?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She's holding up."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She worked out pretty fine for you, didn't she?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She's a good girl. Mixed?up like kids are these days, but we've gotten used to her. My boy and me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan smiles, his fine little mustache spreading an em, and sways a half?step closer. "Little Jill's still keeping you company?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit shrugs, feeling pasty and nervous. He keeps giving hostages to fortune. "She has nowhere else to go."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yes, man, she must be working out real fine for you." Still he doesn't walk away, going out to the platform for his whisky. He stays and, still smiling but letting a pensive considerate shadow slowly subdue his face, says, "You know, friend Harry, what with Labor Day coming on, and the kids going back to school, and all this inflation you see everywhere, things get a bit short. In the financial end."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How many children do you have?" Rabbit asks politely. Working with him all these years, he never thought Buchanan was married.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The plump ash?gray man rocks back and forth on the balls of his feet. "Oh . . . say five, that's been counted. They look to their daddy for support, and Labor Day finds him a little embarrassed. The cards just haven't been falling for old Lester lately."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'm sorry," Rabbit says. "Maybe you shouldn't gamble."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I am just tickled to death little Jilly's worked out to fit your needs," Buchanan says. "I was thinking, twenty would sure help me by Labor Day."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Twenty dollars?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That is all. It is miraculous, Harry, how far I've learned to make a little stretch. Twenty little dollars from a friend to a friend would sure make my holiday go easier all around. Like I say, seeing Jill worked out so good, you must be feeling pretty good. Pretty generous. A man in love, they say, is a friend to all."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> But Rabbit has already fished out his wallet and found two tens. "This is just a loan," he says, frightened, knowing he is lying, bothered by that sliding again, that sweet bladder running late to school. The doors will be shut, the principal Mr. Kleist always stands by the front doors, with their rattling chains and push bars rubbed down to the yellow of brass, to snare the tardy and clap them into his airless office, where the records are kept.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "My children bless you," Buchanan says, folding the bills away. "This will buy a world of pencils."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hey, whatever happened to Babe?" Rabbit asks. He fords, with his money in Buchanan's pocket, he has new ease; he has bought rights of inquiry.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan is caught off guard. "She's still around. She's still doing her thing as the young folks say."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I wondered, you know, if you'd broken off connections."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Because he is short of money. Buchanan studies Rabbit's face, to make certain he knows what he is implying. Pimp. He sees he does, and his mustache broadens. "You want to get into that nice Babe, is that it? Tired of white meat, want a drumstick? Harry, what would your Daddy say?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'm just asking how she was. I liked the way she played."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She sure took a shine to you, I know. Come up to Jimbo's some time, we'll work something out."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She said my knuckles were bad." The bell rasps. Rabbit tries to gauge how soon the next touch will be made, how deep this man is into him; Buchanan sees this and playfully, jubilantly slaps the palm of the hand Rabbit had extended, thinking of his knuckles. The slap tingles. Skin.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buchanan says, "I like you, man," and walks away. A plumpudding?colored roll of fat trembles at the back of his neck. Poor diet, starch. Chitlins, grits.

<br> Also in Dr. Kleist's collection were many fascinating photos of Weiser Street when it held a few rode shops and inns. The most famous of these inns was the Goose and Feathers, where George Washington and his retinue tarried one night on their way west to suppress the Whisky Rebellion in 1720. suppress the Whisky Rebellion in 1799.

<br> 
<br> Pajasek comes up behind him. "Angstrom. Telephone." Pajasek is a small tired bald man whose bristling eyebrows increase the look of pressure about his head, as if his forehead is being pressed over his eyes, forming long horizontal folds. "You might tell the party after this you have a home number."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Sorry, Ed. It's probably my crazy wife."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Could you get her to be crazy on your private time?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Crossing from his machine to the relative quiet of the frostedglass walls is like ascending through supportive water to the sudden vacuum of air. Instantly, he begins to struggle. ` Janice, for Christ's sake, I told you not to call me here. Call me at home."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't want to talk to your little answering service. Just the thought of her voice makes me go cold all over."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nelson usually answers the phone. She never answers it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't want to hear her, or see her, or hear about her. I can't describe to you, Harry, the disgust I feel at just the thought of that person."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Have you been on the bottle again? You sound screwed?up."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I am sober and sane. And satisfied, thank you. I want to know what you're doing about Nelson's back?to?school clothes. You realize he's grown three inches this summer and nothing will fit."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Did he, that's terrific. Maybe he won't be such a shrimp after all."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He will be as big as my father and my father is no shrimp."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Sorry, I always thought he was."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Do you want me to hang up right now? Is that what you want?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No, I just want you to call me someplace else than at work."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She hangs up. He waits in Pajasek's wooden swivel chair, looking at the calendar, which hasn't been fumed yet though this is September, and the August calendar girl, who is holding two icecream cones so the scoops cover just where her nipples would be, one strawberry and one chocolate, Double Dips! being the caption, until the phone rings.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What were we saying?" he asks.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I must take Nelson shopping for school clothes."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "O.K., come around and pick him up any time. Set a day."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I will not come near that house, Harry, as long as that girl is in it. I won't even go near Penn Villas. I'm sorry, it's an uncontrollable physical revulsion."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Maybe you're pregnant, if you're so queasy. Have you and Chas been taking precautions?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Harry, I don't know you any more. I said to Charlie, I can't believe I lived thirteen years with that man, it's as if it never happened." .
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Which reminds me, what shall we get Nelson for his birthday? He's going to be thirteen next month."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She begins to cry. "You never forgave me for that, did you? For getting pregnant."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I did, I did. Relax. It worked out great. I'll send Nelson over to your love nest to go shopping. Name the day."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Send him to the lot Saturday morning. I don't like him coming to the apartment, it seems too terrible when he leaves."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Does it have to be Saturday? There was some talk of Jill driving us both down to Valley Forge; the kid and I've never seen it.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Are you poking fun of me? Why do you think this is all so funny, Harry? This is life."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'm not, we were. Seriously."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well, tell her you can't. You two send Nelson over. Only send him with some money, I don't see why I should pay for his clothes."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Buy everything at Kroll's and charge it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Knoll's has gone terribly downhill, you know it has. There's a nice little new shop now up near Perley, past that submarine place that used to be Chinese."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Open another charge account. Tell him you're Springer Motors and offer a Toyota for security."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Harry, you mustn't be so hostile. You sent me off myself. You said, that night, I'll never forget it, it was the shock of my life, `See him if you want to, just so I don't have to see the bastard.' Those were your words."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hey, that reminds me, I did see him the other day."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Who?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Chas. Your dark and swarthy lover."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He ambushed me after work. Waiting in the alley with a dagger. Oog, I said, you got me, you Commie rat."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What did he want?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, to talk about you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What about me? Harry, are you lying, I can't tell any more. What about me?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Whether or not you were happy."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She makes no comeback, so he goes on, "We concluded you were."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Right," Janice says, and hangs up.
