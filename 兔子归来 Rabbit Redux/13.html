<br> ARSON SUSPECTED IN
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> PENN VILLAS BLAZE
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Out?of?Stater Perishes
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> West Brewer police are still collecting testimony from neighbors in connection with the mysterious fire that destroyed the handsome Penn Villas residence of Mr. and Mrs. Harold Angstrom.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> A guest in the home, Mill Jiss
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> A guest in the home, Miss Jill Pendleton, 18, of Stonington, Connecticut, perished of smoke inhalation and burns. Rescue attempts by valiant firemen were to no avail.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Miss Pendleton was pronounced dead on arrival at the Sister of Mercy Homeopathic Sisters of Mercy Homeopathic Hospital in Brewer.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> A man reported seen in the vicinity of the dwelling, Hubert Johnson last of Plum Street, is being sought for questioning. Mr. Johnson is also known as "Skeeter" and sometimes gives his last name as ]Farnsworth.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Furnace Township fire chief Raymond "Buddy" Fessler told VAT reporters, "The fire was set I'm pretty sure, but we have no evidence of a Molotov cocktail or anything of that nature. This was not a bombing in the ordinary sense."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Neighbors are baffled by the event, reporting nothing unusual about the home but the skulking presence of a black man thought
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Pajasek taps him on the shoulder.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "If that's my wife," Rabbit says. "Tell her to bug off. Tell her I'm dead."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's nobody on the phone, Harry. I need to have a word with you privately. If I may."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> That "if I may" is what puts the chill into Harry's heart. Pajasek is imitating somebody higher up. He shuts his frosted?glass door on the clatter and with a soft thump sits at his desk; he slowly spreads his fingers on the mass of ink?smirched papers there. "More bad news, Harry," he says. "Can you take it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Try me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I hate like Jesus to put this into you right on top of your misfortune with your home, but there's no use stalling. Nothing stands still. They've decided up top to make Verity an offset plant. We'll keep an old flatbed for the job work, but the Vat said either go offset or have them print in Philly. It's been in the cards for years. This way, we'll be geared up to take other periodicals, there's some new sheets starting up in Brewer, a lot of it filth in my book but people buy it and the law allows it, so there you are." From the way he sighs, he thinks he's made his point. His forehead, seen from above, is global; the worried furrows retreat to the horizon of the skull, where the brass?pale hair begins, wisps brushed straight back.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit tries to help him. "So no Linotypers, huh?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Pajasek looks up startled; his eyebrows arch and drop and there is a moment of spherical smoothness, with a long clean highlight from the fluorescent tubes overhead. "I thought I made that point. That's part of the technical picture, that's where the economy comes. Offset, you operate all from film, bypass hot metal entirely. Go to a cathode ray tube, Christ, it delivers two thousand lines a minute, that's the whole Vat in seven minutes. We can keep a few men on, retrain them to the computer tape, we've worked the deal out with the union, but this is a sacrifice, Harry, from the management point of view. I'm afraid you're far down the list. Nothing to do with your personal life, understand me – strictly seniority. Your Dad's secure, and Buchanan, Christ, let him go we'd have every do?good outfit in the city on our necks, it's not the way I'd do things. If they'd come to me I would have told them, that man is half?soused from eleven o'clock on every morning, they're all like that, I'd just as soon have a moron with mittens on as long he was white -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "O.K.," Rabbit says. "When do I knock off?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Harry, this hurts me like hell. You learned the skill and now the bottom's dropping out. Maybe one of the Brewer dailies can take you on, maybe something in Philly or up in Allentown, though what with papers dropping out or doubling up all over the state there's something of a glut in the trade right now."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'll survive. What did Kurt Schrack do?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Who he?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You know. The Schockelschtuhl guy."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Christ, him. That was back in B.C. As I remember he bought a farm north of here and raises chickens. If he's not dead by now."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Right. Die I guess would be the convenient thing. From the management point of view."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't talk like that, Harry, it hurts me too much. Give me credit for some feelings. You're a young buck, for Chrissake, you got the best years still ahead of you. You want some fatherly advice? Get the hell out of the county. Leave the mess behind you. Forget that slob you married, no offense."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No offense. About Janice, you can't blame her, I wasn't that great myself. But I can't go anywhere, I got this kid."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Kid, schmid. You can't live your life that way. You got to reason outwards from Number One. To you, you're Number One, not the kid."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's not how it feels, exactly," Rabbit begins, then sees from the sudden gleaming globe of Pajasek's head bent to study the smirched slips on his desk that the man doesn't really want to talk, he wants Harry to go. So Rabbit asks, "So when do I go?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Pajasek says, "You'll get two months' pay plus the benefits you've accumulated, but the new press is coming in this weekend, faster than we thought. Everything moves faster nowadays."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Except me," Rabbit says, and goes. His father, in the bright racket of the shop, swivels away from his machine and gives him the thumbs down sign questioningly. Rabbit nods, thumbs down. As they walk down Pine Street together after work, feeling ghostly in the raw outdoor air after their day's immersion in fluorescence, Pop says, "I've seen the handwriting on the wall all along, whole new philosophy operating at the top now at Verity, one of the partner's sons came back from business school somewhere full of beans and crap. I said to Pajasek, `Why keep me on, I have less than a year before retirement?' and he says, `That's the reason.' I said to him, `Why not let me go and give my place to Harry?' and he says, `Same reason.' He's running scared himself, of course. The whole economy's scared. Nixon's getting himself set to be the new Hoover, these moratorium doves'll be begging for LBJ to come back before Tricky Dick's got done giving their bank accounts a squeeze!"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Pop talks more than ever now, as if to keep Harry's mind cluttered; he clings to him like sanity. It has been a dreadful three days. All Sunday, on no sleep, he drove back and forth in Peggy's borrowed Fury through Brewer between Mt. Judge and Penn Villas, through the municipal headache of the Columbus Day parade. The monochrome idyll of early morning, Skeeter dwindling to a brown dot in brown fields, became a four?color nightmare of martial music, throbbing exhaustion, bare?thighed girls twirling bolts of lightning, iridescent drummers pounding a tattoo on the taut hollow of Harry's stomach, cars stalled in the sidestreets, Knights of Columbus floats, marching veterans, American flags. Between entanglements with this monster celebration, he scavenged in warm ashes and trucked useless stained and soaked furniture, including a charred guitar, to the garage at the back of the Jackson Road place. He found no wallet near the sofa, and no black bag in the closet. Jill's bureau had been along the wall of which only charred 2 by 4s remained, yet he prodded the ashes for a scrap of the six hundred dollars. Back on Jackson Road, insurance investigators were waiting for him, and the sheriff of Furnace Township, a little apple?cheeked old man, in suspenders and a soft felt hat, who was mostly interested in establishing that his failure to be present at the fire could in no way be held against him. He was quite deaf, and every time someone in the room spoke he would twirl around and alertly croak, "Let's put that on the record too! I want everything out in the open, everything on the record!"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Worst of all, Harry had to talk to Jill's mother on the telephone. The police had broken the news to her and her tone fluctuated between a polite curiosity about how Jill came to be living in this house and a grieved outrage seeking its ceiling, a bird cramped in a cage of partial comprehension.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She was staying with me, yes, since before Labor Day," Rabbit told her, over the downstairs phone, in the dark living room, smelling of furniture polish and Mom's medicine. "Before that she had been bumming around in Brewer with a crowd of Negroes who hung out at a restaurant they've closed down since. I thought she'd be better off with me than with them."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "But the police said there was a Negro."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah. He was a friend of hers. He kind of came and went." Each time he was made to tell this story, he reduced the part Skeeter played, beginning with having to lie about driving him south that morning, until the young black man has become in his backwards vision little more substantial than a shadow behind a chair. "The cops say he might have set the fire but I'm sure he didn't."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How are you sure?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I just am. Look, Mrs. -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Aldridge." And this, of all things, her second husband's name, set her to crying.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He fought through her sobbing. "Look, it's hard to talk now, I'm dead beat, my kid's in the next room, if we could talk face to face, I could maybe explain -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The outrage tested a wing. "Explain! Can you explain her back to life?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No, I guess not."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The politeness returned. "My husband and I are flying to Philadelphia tomorrow morning and renting a car. Perhaps we should meet."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah. I'd have to take off from work, except for the lunch hour."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "We'll meet at the West Brewer police station," the distant voice said with surprising firmness, a sudden pinch of authority. "At noon."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit had never been there before. The West Brewer Borough Hall was a brick building with white trim, set diagonally on a plot of grass and flower beds adjacent to the tall madhouse, itself really an addition to the original madhouse, a granite mansion built a century ago by one of Brewer's iron barons. All this land had belonged to that estate. Behind the borough hall stretched a long cement?block shed with a corrugated roof, some doors were open and Rabbit saw trucks, a steamroller, the spidery black machine that tars roads, the giant arm that lifts a man in a basket to trim branches away from electric wires. These appliances of a town's housekeeping seemed to him part of a lost world of blameless activity; he would never be allowed to crawl back into that world. Inside the town hall, there were wickets where people could pay their utilities bills, paneled doors labelled in flaking gold Burgess and Assessor and Clerk. Gold arrows pointed downstairs to the Police Department. Rabbit saw too late that he could have entered this half?basement from the side, saving himself the curious gaze of ten town employees. The cop behind the greentopped counter looked familiar, but it took a minute for the sidebums to register. The collegiate type. Harry was led down a hall past mysterious rooms; one brimmed with radio equipment, another with filing cabinets, a third gave on a cement stairway leading still further down. The dungeon. Jail. Rabbit wanted to run down into this hole and hide but was led into a fourth room, with a dead green table and metal folding chairs. The brokennosed chief was in here and a woman who, though hollow with exhaustion and slow?spoken with pills, was Connecticut. She had more edge, more salt to her manner, than Pennsylvania women. Her hair was not so much gray as grayed; her suit was black. Jill's pensive thin face must have come from her father, for her mother had quite another kind, a roundish eager face with pushy lips that when she was happy must be greedy. Rabbit flicked away the impression of a peppy little dog: wideset brown eyes, a touch of jowl, a collar of pearls at her throat. Nifty tits, Jill had said, but her mother's cupped and braced bosom struck Rabbit in this moment of sexless and sorrowing encounter as a militant prow, part of a uniform's padding. He regretted that he had not enough praised Jill here, her boyish chest with its shallow faint shadows, where she had felt to herself shy and meager and yet had been soft enough in his mouth and hands, quite soft enough, and abundant, as grace is abundant, that we do not measure, but take as a presence, that abounds. In his mist, he heard the chief grunt introductions: Mr. and Mrs. Aldridge. Rabbit remembered in Jill's song the tax lawyer from Westerly, but the man remained blank for him; he had eyes only for the woman, for this wrong?way reincarnation of Jill. She had Jill's composure, less fragilely; even her despairing way of standing with her hands heavy at her sides, at a loss, was Jill's. Rabbit wondered, Has she come from identifying the remains? What was left but blackened bones? Teeth. A bracelet. A flesh- colored swatch of hair. "Hey," he said to her, "I'm sick about this."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yes?s." Her bright eyes passed over his head. "Over the phone, I was so stupid, you mentioned explaining."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Had he? What had he wanted to explain? That it was not his fault. Yet Nelson thought it was. For taking her in? But she was unsheltered. For fucking her? But it is all life, sex, fire, breathing, all combination with oxygen, we shimmer at all moments on the verge of conflagration, as the madhouse windows tell us. Rabbit tried to remember. "You had asked about Skeeter, why I was sure he hadn't set the fire."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yes. Why were you?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He loved her. We all did."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You all used her?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "In ways."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "In your case" ? strange precision, clubwoman keeping a meeting within channels, the vowels roughened by cigarettes and whisky, weathered in the daily sunslant of cocktails ? "as a concubine?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He guessed at what the word meant. "I never forced it," he said. "I had a house and food. She had herself. We gave what we had."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You are a beast." Each word was too distinct; the sentence had been lying in her mind and had warped and did not quite fit.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "O.K., sure," he conceded, refusing to let her fly, to let that caged outrage escape her face and scream. Stepdaddy behind her coughed and shifted weight, preparing to be embarrassed. Harry's guts felt suspended and transparent, as before a game. He was matched against this glossy woman in a way he was never matched with Jill. Jill had been too old for him, too wise, having been born so much later. This little pug, her money and rasping clubwoman voice aside, was his generation, he could understand what she wanted. She wanted to stay out ofharm's way. She wanted to have some fun and not be blamed. At the end she wanted not to have any apologizing to do to any heavenly committee. Right now she wanted to tame the ravenous miracle of her daughter's being cast out and destroyed. Mrs. Aldridge touched her cheeks in a young gesture, then let her hands hang heavy beside her hips.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'm sorry," she said. "There are always . . . circumstances. I wanted to ask, were there any . . . effects."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Effects?" He was back with blackened bones, patterns of teeth, melted bracelets. He thought of the bracelets girls in high school used to wear, chains with name?tags, Dorene, Margaret, Mary Ann.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Her brothers asked me . . . some memento..."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Brothers? She had said. Three. One Nelson's age.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Aldridge stepped forward, bewildered, hoping to be helpful. "There was a car."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "They sold the car," Rabbit said, too loudly. "She ran it without oil and the engine seized up and she sold it for junk."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> His loudness alarmed her. He was still indignant, about the waste of that car. She took a step backward, protesting, "She loved the car."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She didn't love the car, she didn't love anything we would have loved, he wanted to tell Mrs. Aldridge, but maybe she knew more than he, she was there when Jill first saw the car, new and white, her father's gift. Rabbit at last found in his mind an "effect." "One thing I did find," he told Mrs. Aldridge, "her guitar. It's pretty well burned, but-"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Her guitar," the woman repeated, and perhaps having forgotten that her daughter played brought her eyes down, made her round face red and brought the man over to comfort her, a man blank like men in advertisements, his coat impeccable and in the breast pocket a three?folded maroon handkerchief. "I have nothing," she wailed, "she didn't even leave me a note when she left." And her voice had shed its sexy roughness, become high and helpless; it was Jill again, begging, Hold me, help me, I'm all shit inside, everything is crashing in.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry turned from the sight. The chief, leading him out the side door, said, "Rich bitch, if she'd given the girl half a reason to stay home she'd be alive today. I see things like this every week. All our bad checks are being cashed. Keep your nose clean, Angstrom, and take care ofyour own." A coach's paternal punch on the arm, and Harry was sent back into the world.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Pop, how about a quick one?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not today, Harry, not today. We have a surprise for you at home. Mim's coming."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You sure?" The vigil for Mim is months old; she keeps sending postcards, always with a picture of a new hotel on them.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yep. She called your mother this morning from New York City, I talked to your mother this noon. I should have told you but you've had so much on your mind I thought, Might as well save it. Things come in bunches, that's the mysterious truth. We get numb and the Lord lets us have it, that's how His mercy works. You lose your wife, you lose your house, you lose your job. Mim comes in the same day your mother couldn't sleep a wink for nightmares, I bet she's been downstairs all day trying to tidy up if it kills her, you wonder what's next." But he has just said it: Mom's death is next. The number 16A bus joggles, sways, smells of exhaust. The Mt. Judge way, there are fewer Negroes than toward West Brewer. Rabbit sits on the aisle; Pop, by the window, suddenly hawks and spits. The spittle runs in a weak blur down the dirty glass. "Goddammit, but that burns me," he explains, and Rabbit sees they have passed a church, the big gray Presbyterian at Weiser and Park: on its steps cluster some women in overcoats, two young men with backwards collars, nuns and schoolchildren carrying signs and unlit candles protesting the war. This is Moratorium Day. "I don't have much use for Tricky Dick and never have," Pop is explaining, "but the poor devil, he's trying to do the decent thing over there, get us out so the roof doesn't fall in until after we leave, and these queer preachers so shortsighted they can't see across the pulpit go organizing these parades that all they do is convince the little yellow Reds over there they're win-ning. If I were Nixon I'd tax the bejesus out of the churches, it'd take some of the burden off the little man. Old Cushing up there in Boston must be worth a hundred million just by his lonesome."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Pop, all they're saying is they want the killing to stop."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "They've got you too, have they? Killing's not the worst thing around. Rather shake the hand of a killer than a traitor."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> So much passion, where he now feels none, amuses Harry, makes him feel protected, at home. It has been his salvation, to be home again. The same musty teddy?bear smells from the carpet, the same embrace of hot air when you open the cellar door, the same narrow stairs heading up off the living room with the same loose baluster that lost its dowel and has to be renailed again and again, drying out in the ebb of time; the same white?topped kitchen table with the four sets of worn spots where they used to eat. An appetite for boyish foods has returned: for banana slices on cereal, for sugar doughnuts though they come in boxes with cellophane windows now instead ofin waxpaper bags, for raw car-rots and cocoa, at night. He sleeps late, so he has to be wakened for work; in Penn Villas, in the house where Janice never finished making curtains, he would be the one the sun would usually rouse first. Here in Mt. Judge familiar gloom encloses him. The distor-tions in Mom's face and speech, which used to distress him during his visits, quickly assimilate to the abiding reality of her presence, which has endured all these years he has been absent and which remains the same half of the sky, sealing him in ? like the cellar bulkhead out back, of two heavy halves. As a child he used to crouch on the cement steps beneath them and listen to the rain. The patter above seemed to be pitting his consciousness lovingly and mixing its sound with the brusque scrape and stride of Mom working in the kitchen. She still, for spells, can work in the kitchen. Harry's being home, she claims, is worth a hundred doses of L?dopa.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The one disturbing element, new and defiant of assimilation, is Nelson. Sullen, grieving, strangely large and loutish sprawled on the caneback davenport, his face glazed by some television of remembrance: none of them quite know what to do about him. He is not Harry, he is sadder than Harry ever was, yet he demands the privileges and indulgence of Harry's place. In the worn shad-ows of the poorly lit half?house on Jackson Road, the Angstroms keep being startled by Nelson's ungrateful presence, keep losing him. "Where's Nellie?" "Where did the kid get to?" "Is the child upstairs or down?" are questions the other three often put to one another. Nelson stays in his temporary room ? Mim's old room ?for hours of listening to rock?pop?folk turned down to a murmur. He skips meals without explaining or apologizing, and is making a scrapbook of news items the Brewer papers have carried about their fire. Rabbit discovered this scrapbook yesterday, snooping in the boy's room. Around the clippings the boy had drawn with various colors of ballpoint flowers, peace signs, Tao crosses, musi-cal notes, psychedelic rainbows, those open?ended swirling doodles associated with insanity before they became commercial. Also there are two Polaroid snaps of the ruin; Billy took them Monday with a new camera his father had given him. The pho-tos, brownish and curling, show a half?burned house, the burned half dark like a shadow but active in shape, eating the unburned half, the garage studs bent like matchsticks in an ashtray. Looking at the photographs, Rabbit smells ash. The smell is real and not remembered. In Nelson's closet he finds the source, a charred gui-tar. So that is why it wasn't in the garage when he looked for it, to give to Jill's mother. She is back in Connecticut now, let the poor kid keep it. His father can't reach him, and lives with him in his parents' house as an estranged, because too much older, brother.

<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He and his father see, walking up Jackson Road, a strange car parked in front of number 303, a white Toronado with orange-on?blue New York plates. His father's lope accelerates; "There's Mim!" he calls, and it is. She is upstairs and comes to the head of the stairs as they enter beneath the fanlight of stained glass; she descends and stands with them in the murky little foyer. It is Mim. It isn't. It has been years since Rabbit has seen her. "Hi," Mim says, and kisses her father dryly, on the cheek. They were never, even when the children were little, much of a family for kissing. She would kiss her brother the same way, dismissingly, but he holds her, wanting to feel the hundreds of men who have held her before, this his sister whose diapers he changed, who used to hold his thumb when they'd go for Sunday walks along the quarry, who once burst out oh I love you sledding with him, the runners whistling on the dark packed slick, the street waxy with snow still falling. Puzzled by his embrace, Mim kisses him again, another peck on the same cheek, and then finely shrugs his arms away. A competence in that. She feels lean, not an ounce extra but all woman; swimming must do it, in hotel pools, late hours carve the fat away and swimming smooths what's left. She appears to wear no makeup, no lipstick, except for her eyes, which are inhuman, Egyptian, drenched in peacock purple and blue, not merely outlined but re?created, and weighted with lashes he expects to stick fast when she blinks. These marvellously masked eyes force upon her pale mouth all expressiveness; each fractional smile, sardonic crimping, attentive pout, and abrupt broad laugh follows its predecessor so swiftly Harry imagines a coded tape is being fed into her head and producing, rapid as electronic images, this alphabet of expressions. She used to have buck teeth but that has been fixed. Her nose, her one flaw, that kept her off the screen, that perhaps kept her from fame, is still long, with a faceted lump of cartilage at the end, exactly like Mom's nose, but now that Mim is thirty and never going to be a screen beauty seems less a flaw, indeed saves her face from looking like others and gives it, between the peacock eyes and the actressy?fussy mouth, a lenient homeliness. And this, Rabbit guesses, would extend her appeal for men, though now she would get barroom criers, with broken careers and marriages, rather than hard?hearted comers who need an icy showpiece on their arm. In the style of the Sixties her clothes are clownish: bell?bottom slacks striped horizontally as if patched from three kinds of gingham; a pinstripe blouse, mannish but for the puff sleeves; shoes that in color and shape remind him of Donald Duck's bill; and hoop earrings three inches across. Even in high school Mim had liked big earrings; they made her look like a gypsy or Arab then, now, with the tan, Italian. Or Miami Jewish. Her hair is expensively tousled honey?white, which doesn't offend him; not since junior high has she worn it the color it was, the mild brown she once called, while he leaned in her doorway watching her study herself in the mirror, "Protestant rat."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Pop busies his hands, touching her, hanging up his coat, steering her into the dismal living room. "When did you get here? Straight from the West Coast? You fly straight to Idlewild, they do it non?stop now, don't they?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Pop, they don't call it Idlewild any more. I flew in a couple days ago, I had some stuff in New York to do before I drove down. Jersey was breathtaking, once you got past the oil tanks. Everything still so green."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Where'd you get the car, Mim? Rent it from Hertz?" The old man's washed?out eyes sparkle at her daring, at her way with the world.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Mim sighs. "A guy lent it to me." She sits in the caneback rocker and puts her feet up on the very hassock that Rabbit as a child had once dreamed about: he dreamed it was full of dollar bills to solve all their problems. The dream had been so vivid he had tested it; the stitched scar of his incision still shows. The stuffing had been disagreeable fiber deader than straw.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Mim lights a cigarette. She holds it in the exact center of her mouth, exhales twin plumes around it, frowns at the snuffed match.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Pop is enchanted by the routine, struck dumb. Rabbit asks her, "How does Mom seem to you?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Good. For someone who's dying."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She make sense to you?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "A lot of it. The guy who doesn't make much sense to me is you. She told me what you've been doing. Lately."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hang's had a hell of a time lately," Pop chimes in, nodding as if to mesh himself with this spinning wheel, his dazzling daughter. "Today in at Verity, get this, they gave him his notice. They kept me on and canned a man in his prime. I saw the handwriting on the wall but I didn't want it to be me who'd tell him, it was their meatloaf, let them deliver it, bastards, a man gives them his life and gets a boot in the fanny for his pains."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Mim closes her eyes and lets a look of weary age wash over her and says, "Pop, it's fantastic to see you. But don't you want to go up and look in on Mom for a minute? She may need to be led to the pot, I asked her but with me she could be shy still."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Pop rises quickly, obliging; yet then he stands in a tentative crouch, offering to say away her brusqueness. "You two have a language all your own. Mary and I, we used to marvel, I used to say to her, There couldn't ever have been a brother and a sister closer than Harry and Miriam. These other parents used to tell us, you know, about kids fighting, we didn't know what they were talking about, we'd never had an example. I swear to God above we never heard a loud word between the two of you. A lot of boys, all of six when Mim arrived, might have expressed resentment, you know, settled in with things pretty much his own way up to then: not Harry. Right from the start, right from that first summer, we could trust you alone with him, alone in the house, Mary and I off to a movie, about the only way to forget your troubles in those days, go off to a motion picture." He blinks, gropes among these threads for the one to pull it all tight. "I swear to God, we've been lucky," he says, then weakens it by adding, "when you look at some of the things that can happen to people," and goes up; his tears spark as he faces the bulb burning at the head of the stairs, before cautiously returning his eyes to the treads.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Did they ever have a language of their own? Rabbit can't remember it, he just remembers them being here together, in this house season after season, for grade after grade of school, setting off down Jackson Road in the aura of one holiday after another, Hallowe'en, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Valentine's Day, Easter, in the odors and feel of one sports season succeeding another, football, basketball, track; and then him being out and Mim shrunk to a word in his mother's letters; and then him coming back from the Army and finding her grown up, standing in front of the mirror, ready for boys, maybe having had a few, tinting her hair and wearing hoop earrings; and then Janice took him off; and then both of them were off and the house empty of young life; and now both of them are here again. The smoke from her cigarette seems what the room needs, has needed a long time, to chase these old furniture and sickness smells away. He is sitting on the piano stool; he perches forward and reaches toward her. "Gimme a weed."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I thought you stopped."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Years ago. I don't inhale. Unless it's grass."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Grass yet. You've been living it up." She fishes in her purse, a big bright patchy bag that matches her slacks, and tosses him a cigarette. It is menthol, with a complicated filter tip. Death is easily fooled. If the churches don't work, a filter will do.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He says, "I don't know what I've been doing."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I would say so. Mom talked to me for an hour. The way she is now, that's a lot of talking."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What d'ya think of Mom now? Now that you have all this perspective."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She was a great woman. With nowhere to put it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well, is where you put it any better?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It involves less make?believe."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't know, you look pretty fantastic to me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Thanks."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What'd she say? Mom."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nothing you don't know, except Janice calls her a lot."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I knew that. She's called a couple times since Sunday, I can't stand it to talk to her."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why not?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She's too wild. She doesn't make any sense. She says she's getting a divorce but never starts it, she says she'll sue me for burning her house and I tell her I only burned my half. Then she says she'll come get Nelson but never comes, I wish the hell she would."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What does it mean to you, her being wild like this?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I think she's losing her buttons. Probably drinking like a fish."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Mim turns her profile to blunt the cigarette in the saucer serving as an ashtray. "It means she wants back in." Mim knows things, Rabbit realizes proudly. Wherever you go in some directions, Mim has been there. The direction where she hasn't been is the one that has Nelson in it, and the nice hot slap of the slug being made beside your left hand. But these are old directions, people aren't going that way any more. Mim repeats, "She wants you back."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "People keep telling me that," Rabbit says, "but I don't see much evidence. She can find me if she wants to."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Mim crosses her pants legs, aligns the stripes, and lights another cigarette. "She's trapped. Her love for this guy is the biggest thing she has, it's the first step out she's taken since she drowned that baby. Let's face it, Harry. You kids back here in the sticks still believe in ghosts. Before you screw you got to square it with old Jack Frost, or whatever you call him. To square skipping out with herself she has to make it a big deal. So. Remember as kids those candy jars down at Spottsie's you reached inside of to grab the candy and then you couldn't get your fist out? If Janice lets go to pull her hand out she'll have no candy. She wants it out, but she wants the candy too; no, that's not exactly it, she wants the idea of what she's made out of the candy in her own mind. So. Somebody has to break the jar for her."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't want her back still in love with this greaseball."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's how you have to take her."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "The son of a bitch, he even has the nerve, sitting there in these snappy suits, he must make three times what I do just cheating people, he has the fucking nerve to be a dove. One night we all sat in this restaurant with him and me arguing across the table about Vietnam and them playing touch?ass side by side. You'd like him, actually, he's your type. A gangster."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Patiently Mim is sizing him up: one more potential customer at the bar. "Since when," she asks, "did you become such a war lover? As I remember you, you were damn glad to wriggle out of that Korean thing."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's not all war I love," he protests, "it's this war. Because nobody else does. Nobody else understands it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Explain it to me, Harry."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's a, it's a kind of head fake. To keep the other guy off balance. The world the way it is, you got to do something like that once in a while, to keep your options, to keep a little space around you." He is using his arms to show her his crucial concept of space. "Otherwise, he gets so he can read your every move and you're dead."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Mim asks, "You're sure there is this other guy?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Sure I'm sure." The other guy is the doctor who shakes your hand so hard it hurts. I know best. Madness begins in that pinch.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You don't think there might just be a lot of little guys trying to get a little more space than the system they're under lets them have?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Sure there are these little guys, billions of 'em" ? billions, millions, too much of everything ? "but then also there's this big guy trying to put them all into a big black bag. He's crazy, so so must we be. A little."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She nods like a type of doctor herself. "That fits," she says. "Be crazy to keep free. The life you been leading lately sounds crazy enough to last you a while."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What did I do wrong? I was a fucking Good Samaritan. I took in these orphans. Black, white, I said Hop aboard. Irregardless of color or creed, Hop aboard. Free eats. I was the fucking Statue of Liberty."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And it got you a burned?down house."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "O.K. That's other people. That's their problem, not mine. I did what felt right." He wants to tell her everything, he wants his tongue to keep pace with this love he feels for this his sister; he wants to like her, though he feels a forbidding denseness in her, of too many conclusions reached when he wasn't there. He tells her, "I learned some things."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Anything worth knowing?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I learned I'd rather fuck than be blown."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Mim removes a crumb, as of tobacco but the cigarette is filtered, from her lower lip. "Sounds healthy," she says. "Rather unAmerican, though."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And we used to read books. Aloud to each other."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Books about what?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't know. Slaves. History, sort of."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Mim in her stripey clown costume laughs. "You went back to school," she says. "That's sweet." She used to get better marks than he did, even after she began with boys: A's and B's against his B's and C's. Mom at the time told him girls had to be smarter, just to pull even. Mim asks, "So what'd you learn from these books?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I learned" ? he gazes at a corner of a room, wanting to get this right: he sees a cobweb above the sideboard, gesturing in some ceiling wind he cannot feel ?"this country isn't perfect." Even as he says this he realizes he doesn't believe it, any more than he believes at heart that he will die. He is tired of explaining himself. "Speaking of sweet," he says, "how is your life?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Ca va. That's French for, It goes. Va bene."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Somebody keeping you, or is it a new one every night?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She looks at him and considers. A glitter of reflexive anger snipes at her mask of eye makeup. Then she exhales and relaxes, seeming to conclude, Well he's my brother. "Neither. I'm a career girl, Harry. I perform a service. I can't describe it to you, the way it is out there. They're not bad people. They have rules. They're not very interesting rules, nothing like Stick your hand in the fire and make it up to Heaven. They're more like, Ride the exercise bicycle the morning after. The men believe in flat stomach muscles and sweating things out. They don't want to carry too much fluid. You could say they're puritans. Gangsters are puritans. They're narrow and hard because off the straight path you don't live. Another rule they have is, Pay for what you get because anything free has a rattlesnake under it. They're survival rules, rules for living in the desert. That's what it is, a desert. Look out for it, Harry. It's coming East."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's here. You ought to see the middle of Brewer; it's all parking lots."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "But the things that grow here you can eat, and the sun is still some kind of friend. Out there, we hate it. We live underground. All the hotels are underground with a couple of the windows painted blue. We like it best at night, about three in the morning, when the big money comes to the crap table. Beautiful faces, Harry. Hard and blank as chips. Thousands flow back and forth without any expression. You know what I'm struck by back here, looking at the faces? How soft they are. God they're soft. You look so soft to me, Harry. You're soft still standing and Pop's soft curling under. If we don't get Janice propped back under you you're going to curl under too. Come to think of it, Janice is not soft. She's hard as a nut. That's what I never liked about her. I bet I'd like her now. I should go see her."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Sure. Do. You can swap stories. Maybe you could get her a job on the West Coast. She's pretty old but does great things with her tongue."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's quite a hang?up you have there."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I just said, nobody's perfect. How about you? You have some specialty, or just take what comes?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She sits up. "She really hurt you, didn't she?" And eases back. She stares at Harry interested. Perhaps she didn't expect in him such reserves of resentful energy. The living room is dark though the noises that reach them from outside say that children are still playing in the sun. "You're all soft," she says, lulling, "like slugs under fallen leaves. Out there, Harry, there are no leaves. People grow these tan shells. I have one, look." She pulls up her pinstripe blouse and her belly is brown. He tries to picture the rest and wonders if her pussy is tinted honey?blonde to match the hair on her head. "You never see them out in the sun but they're all tan, with ?flat stomach muscles. Their one flaw is, they're still soft inside. They're like those chocolates we used to hate, those chocolate creams, remember how we'd pick through the Christmas box they'd give us at the movie theater, taking out only the square ones and the caramels in cellophane? The other ones we hated, those dark brown round ones on the outside, all ooky inside. But that's how people are. It embarrasses everybody but they need to be milked. Men need to be drained. Like boils. Women too for that matter. You asked me my specialty and that's it, I milk people. I let them spill their insides on me. It can be dirty work but usually it's clean. I went out there wanting to be an actress and that's in a way what I got, only I take on the audience one at a time. In some ways it's more of a challenge. So. Tell me some more about your life."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well I was nursemaid to this machine but now they've retired the machine. I was nursemaid to Janice but she upped and left."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "We'll get her back."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't bother. Then I was nursemaid to Nelson and he hates me because I let Jill die."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She let herself die. Speaking of that, that's what I do like about these kids: they're trying to kill it. Even if they kill themselves in the process."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Kill what?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "The softness. Sex, love; me, mine. They're doing it in. I have nó playmates under thirty, believe it. They're burning it out with dope. They're going to make themselves hard clean through. Like, oh, cockroaches. That's the way to live in the desert. Be a cockroach. It's too late for you, and a little late for me, but once these kids get it together, there'll be no killing them. They'll live on poison.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Mim stands; he follows. For all that she was a tall girl and is enlarged by womanhood and makeup, her forehead comes to his chin. He kisses her forehead. She tilts her face up, slime?blue eyelids shut, to be kissed again. Pop's loose mouth under Mom's chiselled nose. He tells her, "You're a cheerful broad," and pecks her dry cheek. Perfumed stationery. A smile in her cheek pushes his lips. She is himself, with the combination jiggled.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She gives him a sideways hug, patting the fat around his waist. "I swing," Mim confesses. "I'm no showboat like Rabbit Angstrom, but in my quiet way I swing." She tightens the hug, and linked like that they walk to the foot of the stairs, to go up and console their parents.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Next day, Thursday, when Pop and Harry come home, Mim has Mom and Nelson downstairs at the kitchen table, having tea and laughing. "Dad," Nelson says, the first time since Sunday morning he has spoken to his father without first being spoken to, "did you know Aunt Mim worked at Disneyland once? Do Abraham Lincoln for him, please do it again."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Mim stands. Today she wears a knit dress, short and gray; in black tights her legs show skinny and a little knock?kneed, the same legs she had as a kid. She wobbles forward as to a lectern, removes an imaginary piece of paper from a phantom breast pocket, and holds it wavering a little below where her eyes would focus if they could see. Her voice as if on rustling tape within her throat emerges: "Fow?er scow?er and seven yaars ago -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson is falling off the chair laughing; yet his careful eyes for a split second check his father's face, to see how he takes it. Rabbit laughs, and Pop emits an appreciative snarl, and even Mom: the bewildered foolish glaze on her features becomes intentionally foolish, amused. Her laughter reminds Rabbit of the laughter of a child who laughs not with the joke but to join the laughter of others, to catch up and be human among others. To keep the laughter swelling Mim sets out two more cups and saucers in the jerky trance of a lifesize Disney doll, swaying, nodding, setting one cup not in its saucer but on the top of Nelson's head, even to keep the gag rolling pouring some hot water not in the teacup but onto the table; the water runs, steaming, against Mom's elbow. "Stop, you'll scald her!" Rabbit says, and seizes Mim, and is shocked by the tone of her flesh, which for the skit has become plastic, not hers, flesh that would stay in any position you twisted it to. Frightened, he gives her a little shake, and she becomes human, his efficient sister, wiping up, swishing her lean tail from table to stove, taking care of them all.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Pop asks, "What kind of work did Disney have you do, Mim?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I wore a little Colonial get?up and led people through a rep-lica of Mt. Vernon." She curtseys and with both hands in artificial unison points to the old gas stove, with its crusty range and the crazed mica window in the oven door. "The Fa?ther of our Coun-try," she explains in a sweet, clarion, idiot voice,&nbsp; "was himself nev?er a fa?ther."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Mim, you ever get to meet Disney personally?" Pop asks.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Mim continues her act. "His con?nu?bi?al bed, which we see before us, measures five feet four and three?quarter inches from rail to rail, and from head?board to foot?board is two inch?es under sev?en feet, a gi?ant's bed for those days, when most gentle?men were no bigger than warming pans. Here" ?she plucks a plastic fly swatter off the fly?specked wall ? "you see a warm?ing pan."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "If you ask me," Pop says to himself, having not been answered, "it was Disney more than FDR kept the country from going under to the Commies in the Depression."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "The ti?ny holes," Mim is explaining, holding up the flyswatter, "are de?signed to let the heat e?scape, so the fa?ther of our coun?try will not suf?fer a chill when he climbs into bed with his be?lov?ed Mar?tha. Here" ? Mim gestures with two hands at the Verity Press giveaway calendar on the wall, turned to October, a grinning jack?o?lantern ? "is Mar?tha."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson is still laughing, but it is time to let go, and Mim does. She pecks her father on the forehead and asks him, "How's the Prince of Pica today? Remember that, Daddy? When I thought pica was the place where they had the leaning tower."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "North of Brewer somewhere," Nelson tells her, "I forget the exact place, there's some joint that calls itself the Leaning Tower of Pizza." The boy waits to see if this is funny, and though the grown?ups around the table laugh obligingly, he decides that it wasn't, and shuts his mouth. His eyes go wary again. "Can I be excused?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit asks sharply, "Where're you going?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "My room."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's Mim's room. When're you going to let her have it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Any rime."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Whyncha go outdoors? Kick the soccer ball around, do something positive, for Chrissake. Get the self?pity out ofyour system."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Let. Him alone," Mom brings out.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Mim intercedes. "Nelson, when will you show me your famous mini?bike?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's not much good, it keeps breaking down." He studies her, his possible playmate. "You can't ride it in clothes like that."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Out West," she says, "everybody rides motorcycles in trendy knits."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Did you ever ride a motorcycle?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "All the time, Nelson. I used to be den mother for a pack of Hell's Angels. We'll ride over and look at your bike after supper."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's not the kid's bike, it's somebody else's," Rabbit tells her.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It'll be dark after supper," Nelson tells Mim.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I love the dark," she says. Reassured, he clumps upstairs, ignoring his father. Rabbit is jealous. Mim has learned, these years out of school, what he has not: how to manage people.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Shakily, Mom lifts her teacup, sips, sets it down. A perilous brave performance. She is proud of something; he can tell by the way she sits, upright, her neck cords stretched. Her hair has been brushed tight about her head. Tight and almost glossy. "Mim," she says, "went calling today."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit asks, "On who?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Mim answers. "On Janice. At Springer Motors."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well." Rabbit pushes back from the table, his chair legs scraping. "What did the little mutt have to say for herself?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nothing. She wasn't there."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Where was she?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He said seeing a lawyer."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Old man Springer said that?" Fear slides into his stomach, nibbling. The law. The long white envelope. Yet he likes the idea of Mim going over there and standing in one of her costumes in front of the Toyota cutout, a gaudy knife into the heart of the Springer empire. Mim, their secret weapon.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No," she tells him, "not old man Springer. Stavros."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You saw Charlie there? Huh. How does he look? Beat?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He took me out to lunch."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Where?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't know, some Greek place in the black district."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit has to laugh. People dead and dying all around him, he has to let it out. "Wait'll he tells her that."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Mim says, "I doubt he will."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Pop is slow to follow. "Who're we talking about, Mim? That slick talker turned Janice's head?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Mom's face gropes; her eyes stretch as if she is strangling while her mouth struggles to frame a droll thought. In suspense they all fall silent. "Her lover," she pronounces. A sick feeling stabs Rabbit.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Pop says, "Well I've kept my trap shut throughout this mess, don't think Harry there wasn't a temptation to meddle but I kept my peace, but a lover in my book is somebody who loves somebody through thick and thin and from all I hear this smooth operator is just after the ass. The ass and the Springer name. Pardon the expression."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I think," Mom says, faltering though her face still shines. "It's nice. To know Janice has."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "An ass," Mim finally completes for her. And it seems to Rabbit wicked that these two, Pop and Mim, are corrupting Mom on the edge of the grave. Coldly he asks Mim, "What'd you and Chas talk about?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh," Mim says, "things." She shrugs her knitted hip off the kitchen table, where she has been perched as on a bar stool. "Did you know, he has a rheumatic heart? He could kick off at any minute."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Fat chance," Rabbit says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That type of operator," Pop says, snarling his teeth back into place, "lives to be a hundred, while they bury all the decent natural Americans. Don't ask me why it works that way, the Lord must have His reasons."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Mim says, "I thought he was sweet. And quite intelligent. And much nicer about you all than you are about him. He was very thoughtful about Janice, he's probably the first person in thirty years to give her some serious attention as a person. He sees a lot in her."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Must use a microscope," Rabbit says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And you," Mim says, turning, "he thinks you're about the biggest spook he's ever met. He can't understand why if you want Janice back you don't come and get her back."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit shrugs. "Too proud or lazy. I don't believe in force. I don't like contact sports."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I did tell him, what a gentle brother you were."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Never hurt a fly if he could help it, used to worry me," Pop says. "As if we'd had a girl and didn't know it. Isn't that the truth, Mother?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Mom gets out, "Never. All boy."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "In that case, Charlie says," Mim goes on.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit interrupts: " `Charlie' yet."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> " `In that case,' he said, `why is he for the war?"'
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Fuck," Rabbit says. He is more tired and impatient than he knew. "Anybody with any sense at all is for the damn war. They want to fight, we got to fight. What's the alternative? What?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Mim tries to ride down her brother's rising anger. "His theory is," she says, "you like any disaster that might spring you free. You liked it when Janice left, you liked it when your house burned down."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And I'll like it even more," Rabbit says, "when you stop seeing this greasy creep."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Mim gives him the stare that has put a thousand men in their place. "Like you said. He's my type."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "A gangster, right. No wonder you're out there screwing yourself into the morgue. You know where party chicks like you wind up? In coroners' reports, when you take too many sleeping pills when the phone stops ringing, when the gangsters find playmates in not such baggy condition. You're in big trouble, Sis, and the Stavroses of the world are going to be no help. They've put you where you are."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Maa?om," Mim cries, out of old instinct appealing to the frail cripple nodding at the kitchen table. "Tell Harry to lay off:" And Rabbit remembers, it's a myth they never fought; they often did.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> When Pop and Harry return from work the next day, Harry's last day on the job, the Toronado with New York plates is not in front of the house. Mim comes in an hour later, after Rabbit has put the supper chops in the oven; when he asks her where she's been, she drops her big stripey bag on the old davenport and answers, "Oh, around. Revisiting the scenes of my childhood. The downtown is really sad now, isn't it? All black?topped parking lots and Afro?topped blacks. And linoleum stores. I did one nice thing, though. I stopped at that store on lower Weiser with the lefty newspapers for sale and bought a pound of peanuts. Believe it or not Brewer is the only place left you can get good peanuts in the shell. Still warm." She tosses him the bag, a wild pass; he grabs it left?handed and as they talk in the living room he cracks peanuts. He uses a flowerpot for the shells.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "So," he says. "You see Stavros again?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You told me not to."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Big deal, what I tell you. How was he? Still clutching his heart?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He's touching. Just the way he carries himself."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Boo hoo. You analyze me some more?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No, we were selfish, we talked about ourselves. He saw right through me. We were halfway into the first drink and he looks me up and down through those tinted glasses and says, `You work the field don't you?' Gimme a peanut."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He tosses a fistful overhanded; they pelt her on the chest. She is wearing a twitchy little dress that buttons down the front and whose pattern imitates lizardskin. When she puts her feet up on the hassock he sees clear to the crotch of her pantyhose. She acts lazy and soft; her eyes have relented, though the makeup shines as if freshly applied. "That's all you did?" he asks. "Eat lunch."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Th?that's all, f?f?folks."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What're you tryin' to prove? I thought you came East to help Mom."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "To help her help you. How can I help her, I'm no doctor."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well, I really appreciate your help, fucking my wife's boyfriend like this."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Mim laughs at the ceiling, showing Harry the horseshoe curve of her jaw's underside, the shining white jugular bulge. As if cut by a knife the laugh ends. She studies her brother gravely, impudently. "If you had a choice, who would you rather went to bed with him, her or me?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Her. Janice, I can always have too, I mean it's possible; but you, never.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I know," Mim gaily agrees. "Of all the men in the world, you're the only one off bounds. You and Pop."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> ` And how does that make me seem?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She focuses hard on him, to get the one?word answer. "Ridiculous."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's what I thought. Hey, Jesus. Did you really give Stavros a bang today? Or're you just getting my goat? Where would you go? Wouldn't Janice miss him at the office?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh ? he could say he was out on a sale or something," Mim offers, bored now. "Or he could tell her to mind her own business. That's what European men do." She stands, touches all the buttons in the front of her lizardskin dress to make sure they're done. "Let's go visit Mom." Mim adds, "Don't fret. Years ago, I made it a rule never to be with a guy more than three times. Unless there was some percentage in getting involved."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> That night Mim gets them all dressed and out to dinner, at the Dutch smorgasbord diner north toward the ball park. Though Mom's head waggles and she has some trouble cutting the crust of her apple pie, she manages pretty well and looks happy: how come he and Pop never thought of getting her out of the house? He resents his own stupidity, and tells Mim in the hall, as they go in to their beds ? she is back in her old room, Nelson sleeps with him now ? "You're just little Miss Fix?It, aren't you?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yes," she snaps, "and you're just big Mister Muddle." She begins undoing her buttons in front of him, and closes her door only after he has turned away.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Saturday morning she takes Nelson in her Toronado over to the Fosnachts; Janice has arranged with Mom that she and Peggy will do something all day with the boys. Though it takes twenty minutes to drive from Mt. Judge to West Brewer, Mim is gone all morning and comes back to the house after two. Rabbit asks her, "How was it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What? "
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No, seriously. Is he that great in the sack, or just about average in your experience? My theory for a while was there must be something wrong with him, otherwise why would he latch on to Janice when he can have all these new birds coming up?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Maybe Janice has wonderful qualities."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Let's talk about him. Relative to your experience." He imagines that all men have been welded into one for her, faces and voices and chests and hands welded into one murmuring pink wall, as once for him the audience at those old basketball games became a single screaming witness that was the world. "To your wide experience," he qualifies.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why don't you tend your own garden instead of hopping around nibbling at other people's?" Mim asks. When she turns in that clown outfit, her lower half becomes a gate of horizontal denim stripes.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I have no garden," he says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Because you didn't tend it at all. Everybody else has a life they try to fence in with some rules. You just do what you feel like and then when it blows up or runs down you sit there and pout."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Christ," he says, "I went to work day after day for ten years."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Mim tosses this off. "You felt like it. It was the easiest thing to do."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You know, you're beginning to remind me of Janice."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She turns again; the gate opens. "Charlie told me Janice is fantastic. A real wild woman."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Sunday Mim stays home all day. They go for a drive in Pop's old Chevy, out to the quarry, where they used to walk. The fields that used to be dusted white with daisies and then yellow with goldenrod are housing tracts now; of the quarry only the great gray hole in the ground remains. The Oz?like tower ofsheds and chutes where the cement was processed is gone, and the mouth of the cave where children used to hide and frighten themselves is sealed shut with bulldozed dirt and rusted sheets of corrugated iron. "Just as well," Mom pronounces. "Awful things. Used to happen there. Men and boys." They eat at the aluminum diner out on Warren Street, with a view of the viaduct, and this meal out is less successful than the last. Mom refuses to eat. "No appetite," she says, yet Rabbit and Mim think it is because the booths are close and the place is bright and she doesn't want people to see her fumble. They go to a movie. The movie page of the Vat advertises: I Am Curious Yellow, Midnight Cowboy, a double bill of Depraved and The Circus (Girls Never Played Games Like This Before!), a Swedish X?film titled Yes, and Funny Girl. Funny Girl sounds like more of the same but it has Barbra Streisand; there will be music. They make it late to the 6:30 show. Mom falls asleep and Pop gets up and walks around in the back of the theater and talks to the usher in a penetrating whine until one of the scattered audience calls out "Shh." On the way out, the lights on, a trio of hoods give Mim such an eye Rabbit gives them back the finger. Blinking in the street, Mom says, "That was nice. But really Fanny. Was very ugly. But stylish. And a gangster. She always knew Nick Arnstein was a gangster. Everybody. Knew it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Good for her," Mim says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It isn't the gangsters who are doing the country in," Pop says. "If you ask me it's the industrialists. The monster fortunes. The Mellons and the du Ponts, those are the cookies we should put in jail."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit says, "Don't get radical, Pop."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'm no radical," the old man assures him, "you got to be rich to be radical."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Monday, a cloudy day, is Harry's first day out of work. He is awake at seven but Pop goes off to work alone. Nelson goes with him; he still goes to school in West Brewer and switches buses on Weiser. Mim leaves the house around eleven, she doesn't say where to. Rabbit scans the want ads in the Brewer Standard. Accountant. Administrative Trainee. Apprentice Spray Painter. Auto Mechanic. Bartender. The world is full of jobs, even with Nixon's Depression. He skips down through Insurance Agents and Programmers to a column of Salesmen and then turns to the funnies. Goddam Apartment 3?G: he feels he's been living with those girls for years now, when is he going to see them with their clothes off? The artist keeps teasing him with bare shoulders in bathrooms, naked legs in the foreground with the crotch coming just at the panel edge, glimpses of bra straps being undone. He calculates: after two months' pay from Verity he has thirty?seven weeks of welfare and then he can live on Pop's retirement. It is like dying now: they don't let you fall though, they keep you up forever with transfusions, otherwise you'll be an embarrassment to them. He skims the divorce actions and doesn't see himself and goes upstairs to Mom.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She is sitting up in the bed, her hands quiet on the quilted coverlet, an inheritance from her own mother. The television is also quiet. Mom stares out ofthe window at the maples. They have dropped leaves enough so the light in here seems harsh. The sad smell is more distinct: fleshly staleness mingled with the peppermint of medicine. To spare her the walk down the hall they have put a commode over by the radiator. To add a little bounce to her life, he sits down heavily on the bed. Her eyes with their film of clouding pallor widen; her mouth works but produces only saliva. "What's up?" Harry loudly asks. "How's it going?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Bad dreams," she brings out. "L?dopa does things. To the system."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "So does Parkinson's Disease." This wins no response. He tries, "What do you hear from Julia Arndt? And what's?er?name, Mamie Kellog? Don't they still come visiting?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I've outlasted. Their interest."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't you miss their gossip?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I think. It scared them when. It all came true."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He tries, "Tell me one of your dreams."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I was picking scabs. All over my body. I got one off and underneath. There were bugs, the same. As when you turn over a rock."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Wow. Enough to make you stay awake. How do you like Mim's being here?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I do."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Still full of sauce, isn't she?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She tries to be. Cheerful."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hard as nails, I'd say."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Inch by inch," Mom says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Huh?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That was on one. Of the children's programs. Earl leaves the set on and makes me watch. Inch by inch."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah, go on."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Life is a cinch. Yard by yard. Life is hard."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He laughs appreciatively, making the bed bounce more. "Where do you think I went wrong?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Who says. You did?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Mom. No house, no wife, no job. My kid hates me. My sister says I'm ridiculous."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You're. Growing up."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Mim says I've never learned any rules."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You haven't had to."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Huh. Any decent kind of world, you wouldn't need all these rules."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She has no ready answer for this. He looks out of her windows. There was a time ? the year after leaving, even five years after when this homely street, with its old?fashioned high crown, its sidewalk blocks tugged up and down by maple roots, its retaining walls of sandstone and railings of painted iron and two?family brickfront houses whose siding imitates gray rocks, excited Rabbit with the magic of his own existence. These mundane surfaces had given witness to his life; this cup had held his blood; here the universe had centered, each downtwirling maple seed of more account than galaxies. No more. Jackson Road seems an ordinary street anywhere. Millions of such American streets hold millions of lives, and let them sift through, and neither notice nor mourn, and fall into decay, and do not even mourn their own passing but instead grimace at the wrecking ball with the same gaunt facades that have outweathered all their winters. However steadily Mom communes with these maples ? the branches' misty snake?shapes as inflexibly fixed in these two windows as the leading of stained glass ? they will not hold back her fate by the space of a breath; nor, if they are cut down tomorrow to widen Jackson Road at last, will her staring, that planted them within herself, halt their vanishing. And the wash of new light will extinguish even her memory of them. Time is our element, not a mistaken invader. How stupid, it has taken him thirty?six years to begin to believe that. Rabbit turns his eyes from the windows and says, to say something, "Having Mim home sure makes Pop happy"; but in his silence Mom, head rolling on the pillow, her nostrils blood?red in contrast with the linen, has fallen asleep.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He goes downstairs and makes himself a peanut?butter sandwich. He pours himself a glass of milk. He feels the whole house as balanced so that his footsteps might shake Mom and tumble her into the pit. He goes into the cellar and fmds his old basketball and, more of a miracle still, a pump with the air needle still screwed into the nozzle. In their frailty things keep faith. The backboard is still on the garage but years have rusted the hoop and loosened the bolts, so the first hard shots tilt the rim sideways. Nevertheless he keeps horsing around and his touch begins to come back. Up and soft, up and soft. Imagine it just dropping over the front of the rim, forget it's a circle. The day is very gray so the light is nicely even. He imagines he's on television; funny, watching the pros on the box how you can tell, from just some tone of their bodies as they go up, if the shot will go in. Mim comes out of the house, down the back steps, down the cement walk, to him. She is wearing a plain black suit, with wide boxy lapels, and a black skirt just to the knee. An outfit a Greek would like. Classic widow. He asks her, "That new?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I got it at Kroll's. They're outlandishly behind the coasts, but their staid things are half as expensive."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You see friend Chas?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Mim puts down her purse and removes her white gloves and signals for the ball. He used to spot her ten points at Twenty?one when he was in high school. As a girl she had speed and a knockkneed moxie at athletics, and might have done more with it if he hadn't harvested all the glory already. "Friend Janice too," she says, and shoots. It misses but not by much.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He bounces it back. "More arch," he tells her. "Where'd you see Jan?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She followed us to the restaurant."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You fight?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not really. We all had Martinis and retsina and got pretty well smashed. She can be quite funny about herself now, which is a new thing." Her grease?laden eyes squint at the basket. "She says she wants to rent an apartment away from Charlie so she can have Nelson." This shot, the ball hits the crotch and every loose bolt shudders looser.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'll fight her all the way on that."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't get uptight. It won't come to that."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh it won't. Aren't you a fucking little know?it?all?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I try. One more shot." Her breasts jog her black lapels as she shoves the dirty ball into the air. A soft drizzle has started. The ball swishes the net, if the net had been there.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How could you give Stavros his bang if Janice was there?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "We sent her back to her father."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He had meant the question to be rude, not for it to be answered. "Poor Janice," he says. "How does she like being out?tarted?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I said, don't get uptight. I'm flying back tomorrow. Charlie knows it and so does she."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Mim. You can't, so soon. What about them?" He gestures at the house. From the back, it has a tenement tallness, a rickety hangdog wood?and?tar?shingle backside mismatched to its solid street face. "You'll break their hearts."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "They know. My life isn't here, it's there."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You have nothing there but a bunch of horny hoods and a good chance of getting V.D."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, we're clean. Didn't I tell you? We're all obsessed with cleanliness."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah. Mim. Tell me something else. Don't you ever get tired of fucking? I mean" ? to show the question is sincere, not rude "I'd think you would."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She understands and is sisterly honest. "Actually, no. I don't. As a girl I would have thought you would but now being a woman I see you really don't. It's what we do. It's what people do. It's a connection. Of course, there are times, but even then, there's something nice. People want to be nice, haven't you noticed? They don't like being shits, that much; but you have to find some way out of it for them. You have to help them."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Her eyes in their lassos of paint seem, outdoors, younger than they have a right to be. "Well, good," he says weakly; he wants to take her hand, to be helped. As her brother, once, he had been afraid she would fall in the quarry if he let go and he had let go and she had fallen and now says it's all right, all things must fall. She laughs and goes on, "Of course I was never squeamish like you. Remember how you hated food that was mixed up, when the peajuice touched the meat or something? And that time I told you all food had to be mushed like vomit before you could swallow it, you hardly ate for a week."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't remember that. Stavros is really great, huh?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Mim picks up her white gloves from the grass. "He's nice." She slaps her paten with the gloves, studying her brother. "Also," she says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What?" He braces for the worst, the hit that will leave nothing there.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I bought Nelson a mini?bike. Nobody in this Godforsaken household seems to remember it, but tomorrow is his birthday. He's going to be thirteen, for Cry?eye. A teenager."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You can't do that, Mim. He'll kill himself. It's not legal on the streets here."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'm having it delivered over to the Fosnachts' building. They can share it on the parking lot, but it'll be Nelson's. The poor kid deserves something for what you put him through."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You're a super aunt."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And you're so dumb you don't even know it's raining." In the darkening drizzle she sprints, still knock?kneed and speedy, up the walk through their narrow backyard, up the stairs of their spindly back porch. Harry hugs the ball and follows.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> In his parents' house Rabbit not only reverts to peanut?butter sandwiches and cocoa and lazing in bed when the sounds of Pop and Nelson leaving have died; he finds himself faithfully masturbating The room itself demands it: a small long room he used to imagine as a railway car being dragged through the night. Its single window gives on the sunless passageway between the houses. As a boy in this room he could look across the space of six feet at the drawn shade of the room that used to be little Carolyn Zim's. The Zims were night owls. Some nights, though he was three grades ahead of her, Carolyn would go to bed later than he, and he would strain to see in the chinks of light around her shade the glimmer of her undressing. And by pressing his face to the chill glass by his pillow he could look at a difficult diagonal into Mr. and Mrs. Zim's room and one night glimpsed a pink commotion that may have been intercourse. But nearly every morning the Zims could be heard at breakfast fighting and Mom used to wonder how long they would stay together. People that way plainly wouldn't be having intercourse. In those days this room was full of athletes, mostly baseball players, their pictures came on school tablet covers, Musial and DiMag and Luke Appling and Rudy York. And for a while there had been a stamp collection, weird to remember, the big blue album with padded covers and the waxpaper mounts and the waxpaper envelopes stuffed with a tumble of Montenegro and Sierra Leone cancelleds. He imagined then that he would travel to every country in the world and send Mom a postcard from every one, with these stamps. He was in love with the idea of travelling, with running, with geography, with Parcheesi and Safari and all board games where you roll the dice and move; the sense of a railroad car was so vivid he could almost see his sallow overhead light, tulip?shaped, tremble and sway with the motion. Yet travelling became an offense in the game he got good at.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The tablet covers were pulled from the wall while he was in the Army. The spots their tacks left were painted over. The tulip of frosted glass was replaced by a fluorescent circle that buzzes and flickers. Mom converted his room to her junk room: an old pushtreadle Singer, a stack ofReader's Digests and Family Circles, a bridge lamp whose socket hangs broken like a chicken's head by one last tendon, depressing pictures of English woods and Italian palaces where he has never been, the folding cot from Sears on which Nelson slept in his father's room while Mim was here. When Mim left Tuesday, the kid, dazed by his good fortune in owning a mini?bike over in West Brewer, moved back into her room, abandoning Rabbit to memories and fantasies. He always has to imagine somebody, masturbating. As he gets older real people aren't exciting enough. He tried imagining Peggy Fosnacht, because she had been recent, and good, all gumdrops; but remembering her reminds him that he has done nothing for her, has not called her since the fire, has no desire to, left her blue Fury in the basement and had Nelson give her the key, scared to see her, blames her, she seduced him, the low blue flame that made her want to be fucked spread and became the fire. From any thought of the fire his mind darts back singed. Nor can he recall Janice; but for the bird?like dip of her waist under his hand in bed she is all confused mocking darkness where he dare not insert himself. He takes to conjuring up a hefty coarse Negress, fat but not sloppy fat, .muscular and masculine, with a trace of a mustache and a chipped front tooth. Usually she is astraddle him like a smiling Buddha, slowly rolling her ass on his thighs, sometimes coming forward so her big cocoa?colored breasts swing into his face like boxing gloves with sensitive tips. He and this massive whore have just shared a joke, in his fantasy; she is laughing and good humor is rippling through his chest; and the room they are in is no ordinary room but a kind of high attic, perhaps a barn, with distant round windows admitting dusty light and rafters from which ropes hang, almost a gallows. Though she is usually above him, and he sometimes begins on his back, imagining his fingers are her lips, for the climax he always rolls over and gives it to the bed in the missionary position. He has never been able to shoot off lying on his back; it feels too explosive, too throbbing, too blasphemous upwards. God is on that side of him, spreading His feathered wings as above a crib. Better turn and pour it into Hell. You nice big purplelipped black cunt. Gold tooth.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> When this good?humored goddess of a Negress refuses, through repeated conjuration, to appear vividly enough, he tries imagining Babe. Mim, during her brief stay, told him offhand, at the end of his story, that what he should have done was sleep with Babe; it had been all set up, and it was what his subconscious wanted. But Babe in his mind has stick fingers cold as ivory, and there is no finding a soft hole in her, she is all shell. And the puckers on her face have been baked there by a wisdom that withers him. He has better luck making a movie that he is not in, imagining two other people, Stavros and Mim. How did they do it? He sees her white Toronado barrelling up the steepness of Eisenhower Avenue, stopping at 1204. The two of them get out, the white doors slam punkily, they go in, go up, Mim first. She would not even turn for a preliminary kiss; she would undress swiftly. She would stand in noon windowlight lithe and casual, her legs touching at the knees, her breasts with their sunken nipples and bumpy aureoles (he has seen her breasts, spying) still girlish and undeveloped, having never nursed a child. Stavros would be slower in undressing, stolid, nursing his heart, folding his pants to keep the crease for when he returns to the lot. His back would be hairy: dark whirlpools on his shoulder blades. His cock would be thick and ropily veined, ponderous but irresistible in rising under Mim's deft teasing; he hears their wisecracking voices die; he imagines afternoon clouds dimming the sepia faces of the ancestral Greeks on the lace?covered tables; he sees the man's clotted cock with the column of muscle on its underside swallowed by Mim's rat?furred vagina (no, she is not honey?blonde here), sees her greedy ringless fingers press his balls deeper up, up into her ravenous stretched cunt; and himself comes. As a boy, Rabbit had felt it as a spaceflight, a squeezed and weightless toppling over onto his head but now it is a mundane release as of anger, a series of muffled shouts into the safe bedsheet, rocks thrown at a boarded window. In the stillness that follows he hears a tingling, a submerged musical vibration slowly identifiable as the stereo set of the barefoot couple next door, in the other half of the house.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> One night while he is letting his purged body drift in listening Jill comes and bends over and caresses him. He turns his head to kiss her thigh and she is gone. But she has wakened him; it was her presence, and through this rip in her death a thousand details are loosed; tendrils of hair, twists of expression, her frail voice quavering into pitch as she strummed. The minor details of her person that slightly repelled him, the hairlines between her teeth, her doughy legs, the apple smoothness of her valentine bottom, the something prim and above?it?all about her flaky?dry mouth, the unwashed white dress she kept wearing, now return and become the body of his memory. Times return when she merged on the bed with moonlight, her young body just beginning to learn to feel, her nerve endings still curled in like fernheads in the spring, green, a hardness that repelled him but was not her fault, the gift of herself was too new to give. Pensive moments of her face return to hurt him. A daughterly attentiveness he had bid her hide. Why? He had retreated into protest and did not wish her to call him out. He was not ready, he had been affronted. Let black Jesus have her; he had been converted to a hardness of heart, a billion cunts and only one him. He tries to picture, what had been so nice, Jill and Skeeter as he actually saw them once in hard lamplight, but in fantasy now Rabbit rises from the chair to join them, to be a father and lover to them, and they fly apart like ink and paper whirling to touch for an instant on the presses. JILL COMES AGAIN. Angstrom ?Senses Presence. She breathes upon him again as he lies in his boyhood bed and this time he does not make the mistake of turning his face, he very carefully brings his hand up from his side to touch the ends of her hair where it must hang. Waking to find his hand in empty mid?air he cries; grief rises in him out of a parched stomach, a sore throat, singed eyes; remembering her daughterly blind grass?green looking to him for more than shelter he blinds himself, leaves stains on the linen that need not be wiped, they will be invisible in the morning. Yet she had been here, her very breath and presence. He must tell Nelson in the morning. On this dreamlike resolve he relaxes, lets his room, with hallucinatory shuddering, be coupled to an engine and tugged westward toward the desert, where Mim is now.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That bitch," Janice said. "How many times did you screw her?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Three times," Charlie said. "That ended it. It's one of her rules."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> This ghost of conversation haunts Janice this night she cannot sleep. Harry's witch of a sister has gone back to whoring but her influence is left behind in Charlie like a touch of disease. They had it so perfect. Lord they had never told her, not her mother or father or?die nurses at school, only the movies had tried to tell her but they couldn't show it, at least not until recently, how perfect it could be. Sometimes she comes just thinking about him and then other times they last forever together, it is beautiful how slow he can be, murmuring all the time to her, selling her herself. They call it a piece of ass and she never understood why until Charlie, it wasn't on her front so much where she used to get mad at Harry because he couldn't make their bones touch or give her the fric-tion she needed long enough so then he ended blaming her for not being with him, it was deeper inside, where the babies happened, where everything happens, she remembers how, was it with Nelson or poor little Becky, they said push and it was embarrass-ing like forcing it when you haven't been regular, but then the pain made her so panicky she didn't care what came out, and what came out was a little baby, all red?faced and cross as if it had been inter-rupted doing something else in there inside her. Stuff up your ass, she had hated to hear people say it, what men did to each other in jail or in the Army where the only women are yellow women screaming by the roadside with babies in their arms and squatting to go to the bathroom anywhere, disgusting, but with Charlie it is a piece of ass she is giving him, he is remaking her from the bot-tom up, the whole base of her feels made new, it's the foundation of life. Yet afterwards, when she tries to say this, how he remakes her, he gives that lovable shrug and pretends it was something any-body could do, a trick like that little trick he does with matches to amuse his nephews, making them always pick the last one up, instead of the sad truth which is that nobody else in the whole wide (Harry was always worrying about how wide the world was, car-ing about things like how far stars are and the moon shot and the way the Communists wanted to put everybody in a big black bag so he couldn't breathe) world but Charlie could do that for her, she was made for him from the beginning of time without exag-geration. When she tries to describe this to him, how unique they are and sacred, he measures a space of silence with his wonderful hands, just the way his thumbs are put together takes the breath out of her, and slips the question like a cloak from his shoulders.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She asked, "How could you do that to me?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He shrugged. "I didn't do it to you. I did it to her. I screwed her."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why? Why?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why not? Relax. It wasn't that great. She was cute as hell at lunch, but as soon as we got into bed her thermostat switched off. Like handling white rubber."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, Charlie. Talk to me, Charlie. Tell me why."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't lean on me, tiger."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She had made him make love to her. She had done everything for him. She had worshipped him, she had wanted to cry out her sorrow that there wasn't more she could do, that bodies were so limited. Though she had extracted her lover's semen from him, she failed to extract testimony that his sense of their love was as absolute as her own. Terribly ? complainingly, preeningly ? she had said, "You know I've given up the world for you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He had sighed, "You can get it back."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I've destroyed my husband. He's in all the newspapers."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He can take it. He's a showboat."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I've dishonored my parents."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He had turned his back. With Harry it had been usually she who turned her back. Charlie is hard to snuggle against, too broad; it is like clinging to a rock slippery with hair. He had, for him, apol-ogized: "Tiger, I'm bushed. I've felt rotten all day."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Rotten how?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Deep down rotten. Shaky rotten."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> And feeling him slip away from her into sleep had so enraged her she had hurled herself naked from bed, shrieked at him the words he had taught her in love, knocked a dead great?aunt from a bureau top, announced that any decent man would at least have ofered to marry her now knowing she would never accept, did things to the peace of the apartment that now reverberate in her insomnia, so the darkness shudders between pulses of the head-lights that tirelessly pass below on Eisenhower Avenue. The view from the back of Charlie's apartment is an unexpected one, of a bend in the Running Horse River like a cut in fabric, of the ele-phant?colored gas tanks in the boggy land beside the dump, and, around a church with twin blue domes she never knew was there, a little cemetery with iron crosses instead of stones. The traffic out front never ceases. Janice has lived near Brewer all her life but never in it before, and thought all places went to sleep at ten, and was surprised how this city always rumbles with traffic, like her heart which even through dreams keeps pouring out its love.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She awakes. The curtains at the window are silver. The moon is a cold stone above Mt. Judge. The bed is not her bed, then she remembers it has been her bed since, when? July it was. For some reason she sleeps with Charlie on her left; Harry was always on her right. The luminous hands of the electric clock by Charlie's bedside put the time at after two. Charlie is lying face up in the moonlight. She touches his cheek and it is cold. She puts her ear to his mouth and hears no breathing. He is dead. She decides this must be a dream.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Then his eyelids flutter as if at her touch. His eyeballs in the faint cold light seem unseeing, without pupils. Moonlight glints in a dab ofwater at the far corner of the far eye. He groans, and Janice realizes this is what has waked her. A noise not freely given but torn from some heavy mechanism of restraint deep in his chest. Seeing that she is up on an elbow watching, he says, "Hi, tiger. Jesus it hurts."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What hurts, love? Where?" Her breath rushes from her throat so fast it burns. All the space in the room, from the comers in, seems a crystal a wrong move from her will shatter.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Here." He seems to mean to show her but cannot move his arms. Then his whole body moves, arching upward as if twitched by something invisible outside of him. She glances around the room for the unspeaking presence tormenting them, and sees again the lace curtains stamped, interwoven medallions, on the blue of the streetlamp, and against the reflecting blue of the bureau mirroring the square blank silhouettes of framed aunts, uncles, nephews. The groan comes again, and the painful upward arching: a fish hooked deep, in the heart.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Charlie. Is there any pill?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He makes words through his teeth. "Little white. Top shelf. Bathroom cabinet."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The crowded room pitches and surges with her panic. The floor tilts beneath her bare feet; the nightie she put on after her disgraceful scene taps her burning skin scoldingly. The bathroom door sticks. One side of the frame strikes her shoulder, hard. She cannot find the light cord, her hand flailing in the darkness; then she strikes it and it leaps from her touch and while she waits for it to swing back down out of the blackness Charlie groans again, the worst yet, the tightest?sounding. The cord fords her fingers and she pulls; the light pounces on her eyes, she feels them shrink so rapidly it hurts yet she doesn't take the time to blink, staring for the little white pills. She confronts in the cabinet a sick man's wealth. All the pills are white. No, one is aspirin; another is yellow and transparent, those capsules that hold a hundred little bombs to go off against hayfever. Here: this one must be it; though the little jar is unlabelled the plastic squeeze lid looks important. There is tiny red lettering on each pill but she can't take the time to read it, her hands shake too much, they must be right; she tilts the little jar into her palm and five hurry out, no, six, and she wonders how she can be wasting time counting and tries to slide some back into the tiny round glass mouth but her whole body is beating so hard her joints have locked to hold her together. She looks for a glass and sees none and takes the square top of the Water Pik and very stupidly lets the faucet water run to get cold, wetting her palm in turning it off, so the pills there blur and soften and stain the creased skin they are cupped in. She has to hold everything, pills and slopping Water Pik lid, in one hand to free the other to close the bathroom door to keep the light caged away from Charlie. He lifts his large head a painful inch from the pillow and studies the pills melting in her hand and gets out, "Not those. Little white." He grimaces as if to laugh. His head sinks back. His throat muscles go rigid. The noise he makes now is up an octave, a woman's noise. Janice sees she does not have time to go back and search again, he is being tuned too high. She sees that they are beyond chemicals; they are pure spirits, she must make a miracle. Her body feels leaden on her bones, she remembers Harry telling her she has the touch of death. But a pressure from behind like a cuff on the back of her head pitches her forward with a keening cry pitched like his own and she presses herself down upon his body that has been so often pressed upon hers; he has become a great hole nothing less large than she wild with love can fill. She wills her heart to pass through the walls of bone and give its rhythm to his. He grits his teeth "Christ" and strains upward against her as if coming and she presses down with great calm, her body a sufficiency, its warmth and wetness and pulse as powerful as it must be to stanch this wound that is an entire man, his length and breadth loved, his level voice loved and his clever square hands loved and his whirlpools of hair loved and his buffed fingernails loved and the dark gooseflesh bag of his manhood loved and the frailty held within him like a threat and lock against her loved. She is a gateway of love gushing from higher ground; she feels herself dissolving piece by piece like a little mud dam in a sluice. She feels his heart kick like pinned prey and keeps it pinned. Though he has become a devil, widening now into a hole wider than a quarry and then gathering into a pain?squeezed upward thrust as cold as an icicle she does not relent; she widens herself to hold his edges in, she softens herself to absorb the spike of his pain. She will not let him leave her. There is a third person in the room, this person has known her all her life and looked down upon her until now; through this other pair of eyes she sees she is weeping, hears herself praying, Go, Go, to the devil thrashing inside this her man. "Go!" she utters aloud.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Charlie's body changes tone. He is dead. No, at his mouth she eavesdrops on the whistle of his breathing. Sudden sweat soaks his brow, his shoulders, his chest, her breasts, her cheek where it was pressed against his cheek. His legs relax. He grunts, "O.K." She dares slide from him, tucking the covers, which she had torn down to bare his chest, back up to his chin.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Shall I get the real pills now?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "In a minute. Yes. Nitroglycerin. What you brought me was Coricidin. Cold pills."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She sees that his grimace had meant to be laughter, for he does smile now. Harry is right. She is stupid.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> To ease the hurt look from her face Stavros tells her, "Rotten feeling. Pressure worse than a fist. You can't breathe, move anything makes it worse, you feel your own heart. Like some animal skipping inside you. Crazy."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I was scared to leave you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You did great. You brought me back."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She knows this is true. The mark upon her as a giver of death has been erased. As in fucking, she has been rendered transparent, then filled solid with peace. As if after fucking, she takes playful inventory of his body, feels the live sweat on his broad skin, traces a finger down the line of his nose.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He repeats, "Crazy," and sits up in bed, cooling himself, gasping safe on the shore. She snuggles at his side and lets her tears out like a child. Absently, still moving his arms gingerly, he fumbles with the ends of her hair as it twitches on his shoulder.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She asks, "Was it me? My throwing that awful fit about Harry's sister? I could have killed you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Never." Then he admits, "I need to keep things orderly or they get to me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "My being here is disorderly," she says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Never mind, tiger," he says, not quite denying, and tugs her 'hair so her head jerks.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice gets up and fetches the right pills. They had been there all along, on the top shelf, she had looked on the middle shelf. He takes one and shows her how he puts it under his tongue to dissolve. As it dissolves he makes that mouth she loves, lips pushed forward as if concealing a lozenge. When she turns off the light and gets into bed beside him, he rolls on his side to give her a kiss. She does not respond, she is too full of peace. Soon the soft rhythm of his unconscious breathing rises from his side of the bed. On her side, she cannot sleep. Awake in every nerve she untangles her life. The traffic ebbs down below. She and Charlie float motionless above Brewer; he sleeps on the wind, his heart hollow. Next time she might not be able to keep him up. Miracles are granted but we must not lean on them. This love that has blown through her has been a miracle, the one thing worthy of it remaining is to leave. Spirits are insatiable but bodies get enough. She has had enough, he has had enough; more might be too much. She might begin to kill. He calls her tiger. Toward six the air brightens. She sees his square broad forehead, the wiry hair in its tidy waves, the nose so shapely a kind of feminine vanity seems to be bespoken, the mouth even in sleep slightly pouting, a snail?shine of saliva released from one corner. Angel, buzzard, floating, Janice sees that in the vast volume of her love she has renounced the one possible imperfection, its object. Her own love engulfs her; she sinks down through its purity swiftly fallen, all feathers.
