The eight?o'clock news says there was scattered shooting again last night in York and the western part of the state. Edgartown police chief Dominick J. Arena is expected today formally to charge Senator Kennedy with leaving the scene of an accident. Apollo Eleven is in lunar orbit and the Eagle is being readied for its historic descent. Rabbit slept badly and turns the box off and walks around the lawn barefoot to shock the headache out of his skull. The houses of Penn Villas are still, with the odd Catholic car roaring off to mass. Nelson comes down around nine, and after making him breakfast Harry goes back to bed with a cup of coffee and the Sunday Brewer Standard. Snoopy on the front page of the funny papers is lying dreaming on his doghouse and soon Rabbit falls asleep. The kid looked scared. The boy's face shouts, and a soundless balloon comes out. When he awakes, the electric clock says five of eleven. The second hand sweeps around and around; a wonder the gears don't wear themselves to dust. Rabbit dresses ? fresh white shirt out of respect for Sunday ? and goes downstairs the second time, his feet still bare, the carpeting fuzzy to his soles, a bachelor feeling. The house feels enormous, all his. He picks up the phone book and searches out</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Stavros Chas 1204EisenhwerAv</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He doesn't dial, merely gazes at the name and the number as if to see his wife, smaller than a pencil dot, crawling between the letters. He dials a number he knows by heart.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>His father answers. "Yes?" A wary voice, ready to hang up on a madman or a salesman.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Pop, hi; hey, I hope you didn't wait up or anything the other night, we weren't able to make it and I couldn't even get to a phone."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A little pause, not much, just enough to let him know they were indeed disappointed. "No, we figured something came up and went to bed about the usual time. Your mother isn't one to waste herself complaining, as you know."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Right. Well, look. About today."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>His voice goes hoarse to whisper, "Harry, you must come over today. You'll break her heart if you don't."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I will, I will, but -"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The old man has cupped his mouth against the receiver, urging hoarsely, "This may be her last, you know. Birthday."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"We're coming, Pop. I mean, some of us are. Janice has had to go off."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Go off how?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"It's kind of complicated, something about her mother's legs and the Poconos, she decided last night she had to, I don't know. It's nothing to worry about. Everybody's all right, she's just not here. The kid's here though." To illustrate, he calls, "Nelson!"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There is no answer.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"He must be out on his bike, Pop. He's been right around all morning. When would you like us?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Whenever it suits you, Harry. Late afternoon or so. Come as early as you can. We're having roast beef. Your mother wanted to bake a cake but the doctor thought it might be too much for her. I bought a nice one over at the Half?A?Loaf. Butterscotch icing, didn't that used to be your favorite?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"It's her birthday, not mine. What should I get her for a present?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Just your simple presence, Harry, is all the present she desires."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Yeah, O.K. I'll think of something. Explain to her Janice won't be coming."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"As my father, God rest, used to say, It is to be regretted, but it can't be helped."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Once Pop fords that ceremonious vein, he tends to ride it. Rabbit hangs up. The kid's bike ? a rusty Schwinn, been meaning to get him a new one, both fenders rub ? is not in the garage. Nor is the Falcon. Only the oil cans, the gas can, the lawnmower, the jumbled garden hose (Janice must have used it last), a lawn rake with missing teeth, and the Falcon's snow tires are there. For an hour or so Rabbit swims around the house in a daze, not knowing who to call, not having a car, not wanting to go inside with the television set. He pulls weeds in the border beds where that first excited summer of their own house Janice planted bulbs and set in plants and shrubs. Since then they have done nothing, just watched the azaleas die and accepted the daffodils and iris as they came in and let the phlox and weeds fight as these subsequent summers wore on, nature lost in Nature. He weeds until he begins to see himself as a weed and his hand with its ugly big moons on the fingernails as God's hand choosing and killing, then he goes inside the house and looks into the refrigerator and eats a carrot raw. He looks into the phone directory and looks up Fosnacht, there are a lot of them, and two Olivers, and it takes him a while to figure out M is the one, M for Margaret and just the initial to put off obscene calls, though if he were on that kick he'd soon figure out that initials were unattached women. "Peggy, hi; this is Harry Angstrom." He says his name with faint proud emphasis; they were in school together, and she remembers him when he was somebody. "I was just wondering, is Nelson over there playing with Billy? He went off on his bike a while ago and I'm wondering where to."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Peggy says, "He's not here, Harry. Sorry." Her voice is frosted with all she knows, Janice burbling into her ear yesterday. Then more warmly she asks, "How's everything going?" He reads the equation, Ollie left me; Janice left you: hello.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He says hastily, "Great. Hey, if Nelson comes by tell him I want him. We got to go to his grandmother's."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Her voice cools in saying goodbye, joins the vast glaring iceface of all those who know. Nelson seems the one person left in the county who doesn't know: this makes him even more precious. Yet, when the boy returns, red?faced and damp?haired from hard pedalling, he tells his father, "I was at the Fosnachts."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Rabbit blinks and says, "O.K. After this, let's keep in better touch. I'm your mother and your father for the time being." They eat lunch, Lebanon baloney on stale rye. They walk up Emberly to Weiser and catch a 12 bus east into Brewer. It being Sunday, they have to wait twenty minutes under the cloudless colorless sky. At the hospital stop a crowd of visitors gets on, having done their duty, dazed, carrying away dead flowers and read books. Boats, white arrowheads tipping wrinkled wakes, are buzzing in the black river below the bridge. A colored kid leaves his foot in the aisle when Rabbit tries to get off he steps over it. "Big feet," the boy remarks to his companion.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Fat lips," Nelson, following, says to the colored boy.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>They try to find a store open. His mother was always difficult to buy presents for. Other children had given their mothers cheerful junk: dime?store jewelry, bottles of toilet water, boxes of candy, scarves. For Mom that had been too much, or not enough. Mim always gave her something she had made: a woven pot holder, a hand?illustrated calendar. Rabbit was pretty poor at making things so he gave her himself, his trophies, his headlines. Mom had seemed satisfied: lives more than things concerned her. But now what? What can a dying person desire? Grotesque prosthetic devices ? arms, legs, battery?operated hearts ? run through Rabbit's head as he and Nelson walk the dazzling, Sunday?stilled downtown of Brewer. Up near Ninth and Weiser they find a drugstore open. Thermos bottles, sunglasses, shaving lotion, Kodak film, plastic baby pants: nothing for his mother. He wants something big, something bright, something to get through to her. Realgirl Liquid Make?Up, Super Plenamins, Non?Smear polish remover, Nudit for the Legs. A rack of shampoo?in hair color, a different smiling cunt on every envelope: Snow Queen Blond, Danish Wheat, Killarney Russet, Parisian Spice, Spanish Black Wine. Nelson plucks him by the sleeve of his white shirt and leads to where a Sunbeam Clipmaster and a Roto?Shine Magnetic Electric Shoe Polisher nestle side by side, glossily packaged. "She doesn't wear shoes any more, just slippers," he says, "and she never cut her hair that I can remember. It used to hang down to her waist." But his attention is drawn on to a humidifier for $12.95. From the picture on the box, it looks like a fat flying saucer. No matter how immobile she gets, it would be there. Around Brewer, though, the summers are as humid as they can be anyway, but maybe in the winter, the radiators dry out the house, the wallpaper peels, the skin cracks; it might help. It would be there night and day, when he wasn't. He moves on to a Kantleek Water Bottle and a 2%Z ?inch reading glass and dismisses both as morbid. His insides are beginning to feel sickly. The pain of the world is a crater all these syrups and pills a thousandfold would fail to fill. He comes to the Quikease Electric Massager with Scalp Comb. It has the silhouettes of naked women on the box, gracefully touching their shoulders, Lesbians, caressing the backs of their necks, where else the box leaves to the imagination, with what looks like a hair brush on a live wire. $11.95. Bedsores. It might help. It might make her laugh, tickle, buzz: it is life. Life is a massage. And it costs a dollar less than the humidifier. Time is ticking. Nelson tugs at his sleeve and wants a maple walnut ice cream soda. While the kid is eating it, Rabbit buys a birthday card to go with the massager. It shows a rooster crowing, a crimson sun rising, and green letters shouting on the outside It's Great to Get Up in the A.M. . . . and on the inside . . . to Wish You a Happy Birthday, MA! Ma. Am. God, what a lot of ingenious crap there is in the world. He buys it anyway, because the rooster is bright orange and jubilant enough to get through to her. Her eyes aren't dim necessarily but because her tongue gropes they could be. Play it safe.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The world outside is bright and barren. The two of them, father and son, feel sharply alone, Rabbit gripping his bulky package. Where is everybody? Is there life on Earth? Three blocks down the deserted street of soft asphalt the clock that is the face of a giant flower, the center of the Sunflower Beer sign, says they are approaching four. They wait at the same corner, opposite the Phoenix Bar, where Harry's father customarily waits, and take the 16A bus to Mt. Judge. They are the only passengers; the driver tells them mysteriously, "They're about down." Up they go through the City Park, past the World War II tank and the bandshell and the tennis court, around the shoulder of the mountain. On one side of them, gas stations and a green cliff, on the other, a precipice and, distantly, a viaduct. As the kid stares out of the window, toward the next mountain over, Rabbit asks him, "Where did you go this morning? Tell me the truth."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The boy answers, finally. "Eisenhower Avenue."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"To see if Mommy's car was there?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I guess."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Was it?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Yop. "</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"D'you go in?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Nope. Just looked up at the windows awhile."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Did you know the number to look at?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"One two oh four."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You got it."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>They get off at Central, beside the granite Baptist church, and walk up Jackson toward his parents' house. The streets haven't changed in his lifetime. They were built too close together for vacant lots and too solidly to tear down, of a reddish brick with purplish bruises in it, with a texture that as a child Rabbit thought of as chapped, like his lips in winter. Maples and horsechestnuts darken the stumpy front lawns, hedged by little wired barricades of barberry and box. The houses are semi?detached and heavy, their roofs are slate and their porches have brick walls and above each door of oak and bevelled glass winks a fanlight of somber churchly colors. As a child Rabbit imagined that fanlight to be a child of the windows above the Lutheran altar and therefore of ?God, a mauve and golden seeing sentinel posted above where he and Pop and Mom and Mim came and went a dozen times a day. Now, entering with his son, still too much a son himself to knock, he feels his parents' place as stifling. Though the clock on the living?room sideboard says only 4:20, darkness has come: dark carpets, thick drawn drapes, dead wallpaper, potted plants crowding the glass on the side that has the windows. Mom used to complain about how they had the inside half of a corner house; but when the Bolgers, their old neighbors, died, and their half went onto the market, they made no move to inquire after the price, and a young couple from Scranton bought it, the wife pregnant and barefoot and the husband something in one of the new electronics plants out along Route 422; and the Angstroms still live in the dark half. They prefer it. Sunlight fades. They sent him, Harry, out in the world to shine, but hugged their own shadows here. Their neighbor house on the other side, across two cement sidewalks with a strip of grass between them, where lived the old Methodist Mom used to fight with about who would mow the grass strip, has had a FOR SALE sign up for a year. People now want more air and land than those huddled hillside neighborhoods can give them. The house smells to Rabbit of preservative: of odors filming other odors, of layers of time, of wax and aerosol and death; of safety.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A shape, a shade, comes forward from the kitchen. He expects it to be his father, but it is his mother, shuffling, in a bathrobe, yet erect and moving. She leans forward unsmiling to accept his kiss. Her wrinkled cheek is warm; her hand steadying itself on his wrist is knobbed and cold.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Happy birthday, Mom." He hugs the massager against his chest; it is too early to offer it. She stares at the package as if he has put a shield between them.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"I'm sixty?five," she says, groping for phrases, so that her sentences end in the middle. "When I was twenty. I told my boy friend I wanted to be shot. When I was thirty." It is not so much the strange tremulous attempt of her lips to close upon a thought as the accompanying stare, an unblinking ungathering gaze into space that lifts her eyes out of any flow and frightens Rabbit with a sense of ultimate blindness, of a blackboard from which they will all be wiped clean.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You told Pop this?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Not your dad. Another. I didn't meet your dad till later. This other one, I'm glad. He's not here to see me now."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You look pretty good to me," Rabbit tells her. "I didn't think you'd be up."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Nelson. How do I look. To you?" Thus she acknowledges the boy. She has always been testing him, putting him on the defensive. She has never forgiven him for not being another Harry, for having so much Janice in him. Those little Springer hands. Now her own hands, held forgotten in front of her bathrobe belt, constantly work in a palsied waggle.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Nice," Nelson says. He is wary. He has learned that brevity and promptness of response are his best defense.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To take attention off the kid, Rabbit asks her, "Should you be up?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She laughs, an astonishing silent thing; her head tips back, her big nose glints from the facets of its tip and underside, her hand stops waggling. "I know, the way Earl talks. You'd think from the way he wants me in bed. I'm laid out already. The doctor. Wants me up. I had to bake a cake. Earl wanted. One of those tasteless paps from the Half?A?Loaf. Where's Janice?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Yeah, about that. She's awfully sorry, she couldn't come. She had to go off with her mother to the Poconos, it took us all by surprise."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Things can be. Surprising."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From upstairs Earl Angstrom's thin voice calls anxiously, with a wheedler's borrowed triumph, "They're down! Eagle has landed! We're on the moon, boys and girls! Uncle Sam is on the moon!"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"That's just. The place for him," Mom says, and with a rough gesture sweeps her distorted hand back toward her ear, to smooth down a piece of hair that has wandered loose from the bun she still twists up. Funny, the hair as it grays grows more stubborn. They say even inside the grave, it grows. Open coffins of women and find the whole thing stuffed like inside of a mattress. Pubic hair too? Funny it never needs to be cut. Serafina's looked threadbare, mangy. When he touches his mother's arm to help her up the stairs to look at the moon, the flesh above her elbow is disconcerting ?loose upon the bone, as on a well?cooked chicken.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The set is in Mom's bedroom at the front of the house. It has the smell their cellar used to have when they had those two cats. He tries to remember their names. Pansy. And Willy. Willy, the tom, got in so many fights his belly began to slosh and he had to be taken to the Animal Rescue. There is no picture of the moon on the tube, just crackling voices while cardboard cutouts simulate what is happening, and electronic letters spell out who in the crackle of men is speaking .</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>". . . literally thousands of little one and two foot craters around the area," a man is saying in the voice that used to try to sell them Shredded Ralston between episodes of Tom Mix. "We see some angular blocks out several hundred feet in front of us that are prob-ably two feet in size and have angular edges. There is a hill in view just about on the ground track ahead of us. Difficult to estimate, but might be a half a mile or a mile."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A voice identified as Houston says, "Roger, Tranquillity. We copy. Over." The voice has that Texas authority. As if words were invented by them, they speak so lovingly. When Rabbit was stationed at Fort Larson in '53, Texas looked like the moon to him, brown land running from his knees level as a knife, purple rumpled horizon, sky bigger and barer than he could believe, first time away from his damp green Pennsylvania hills, last time too. Everybody's voice was so nice and gritty and loving, even the girls in the whorehouse. Honeh. You didn't pay to be no two?timer.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A voice called Columbia says, "Sounds like a lot better than it did yesterday. At that very low sun angle, it looked rough as a cob then." As a what? The electronic letters specify: MIKE COLLINS SPEAKING FROM COMMAND MODULE ORBITING MOON.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Tranquillity says, "It really was rough, Mike, over the targeted landing area. It was extremely rough, cratered and large numbers of rocks that were probably some many larger than five or ten feet in size." Mom's room has lace curtains aged yellowish and pinned back with tin daisies that to an infant's eyes seemed magical, roseand?thorns wallpaper curling loose from the wall above where the radiator safety valve steams, a kind of plush armchair that soaks up dust. When he was a child this chair was downstairs and he would sock it to release torrents of swirling motes into the shaft of afternoon sun; these whirling motes seemed to him worlds, each an earth, with him on one of them, unthinkably small, unbearably. Some light used to get into the house in late afternoon, between the maples. Now the same maples have thronged that light solid, made the room cellar?dim. The bedside table supports an erect little company of pill bottles and a Bible. The walls hold tinted photographs of himself and Mim in high school, taken he remembers by a pushy pudgy little blue jawed crook who called himself a Studio and weaseled his way into the building every spring and made them line up in the auditorium and wet?comb their hair so their parents couldn't resist two weeks later letting them take in to the homeroom the money for an 8 by 10 tinted print and a sheet of wallet?sized grislies of themselves; now this crook by the somersault of time has become a donor of selves otherwise forever lost: Rabbit's skinny head pink in its translucent blond whiffle, his ears out from his head an inch, his eyes unreally blue as marbles, even his lower lids youthfully fleshy; and Miriam's face plump between the shoulder?length shampoo?shining sheaves rolled under in Rita Hayworth style, the scarlet tint of her lipstick pinned like a badge on the starched white of her face. Both children smile out into space, through the crook's smudged lens, from that sweat?scented giggling gym toward their mother bedridden some day.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Columbia jokes, "When in doubt, land long."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Tranquillity says, "Well, we did."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>And Houston intervenes, "Tranquillity, Houston. We have a P twenty?two update for you if you're ready to copy. Over."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Columbia jokes again: "At your service, sir."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Houston, unamused, a city of computers working without sleep, answers, "Right, Mike. P one one zero four thirty two eighteen; P two one zero four thirty?seven twenty?eight and that is four miles south. This is based on a targeted landing site. Over."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Columbia repeats the numbers.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Tranquillity says, "Our mission timer is now reading nine zero four thirty?four forty?seven and static."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Roger, copy. Your mission timer is now static at ? say again the time."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Nine zero four thirty?four forty?seven."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Roger, copy, Tranquillity. That gravity align looked good. We see you recycling."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Well, no. I was trying to get time sixteen sixty?five out and somehow it proceeded on the six?twenty?two before I could do a BRP thirty?two enter. I want to log a time here and then I'd like to know whether you want me to proceed on torquing angles or to go back and re?enter again before torquing. Over."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Rog, Buzz. Standby."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nelson and his grandfather listen raptly to these procedures; Mary Angstrom turns impatiently ? or is it that her difficulty of motion makes all gestures appear impatient? ? and makes her shuffling way out into the landing and down the stairs again. Rabbit, heart trembling in its hollow, follows. She needs no help going down the stairs. In the garishly bright kitchen she asks, "Where did you say. Janice was?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"In the Poconos with her mother."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Why should I believe that?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Why shouldn't you?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She stoops over, waveringly, to open the oven and look in, her tangled wire hair making a net of light. She grunts, stands, and states, ` Janice. Stays out of my way. These days."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In his frightened, hypnotized condition, Rabbit can only, it seems, ask questions. "Why would she do that?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>His mother stares and stares, only a movement of her tongue between her parted lips betraying that she is trying to speak. "I know too much," she at last brings out, "about her."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Rabbit says, "You know only what a bunch of pathetic old gossips tell you about her. And stop bugging Pop about it, he comes into work and bugs me." Since she does not fight back, he is provoked to go on. "With Mim out turning ten tricks a day in Las Vegas I'd think you'd have more to worry about than poor Janice's private life."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"She was always," his mother brings out, "spoiled."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Yes and Nelson too I suppose is spoiled. How would you describe me? Just yesterday I was sitting over at the Blasts game thinking how lousy I used to be at baseball. Let's face it. As a human being I'm about C minus. As a husband I'm about zilch. When Verity folds I'll fold with it and have to go on welfare. Some life. Thanks, Mom."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Hush," she says, expressionless, "you'll make. The cake fall," and like a rusty jackknife she forces herself to bend over and peer into the gas oven.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Sorry Mom, but Jesus I'm tired lately."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"You'll feel better when. You're my age."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The party is a success. They sit at the kitchen table with the four places worn through the enamel in all those years. It is like it used to be, except that Mom is in a bathrobe and Mim has become Nelson. Pop carves the roast beef and then cuts up Mom's piece in small bits for her; her right hand can hold a fork but cannot use a knife. His teeth slipping down, he proposes a toast in New York State wine to "my Mary, an angel through thick and thin"; Rabbit wonders what the thin was. Maybe this is it. When she unwraps her few presents, she laughs at the massager. "Is this. To keep me hopping?" she asks, and has her husband plug it in, and rests it, vibrating, on the top of Nelson's head. He needs this touch of cheering up. Harry feels Janice's absence gnawing at him. When the cake is cut the kid eats only half a piece, so Rabbit has to eat double so not to hurt his mother's feelings. Dusk thickens: over in West Brewer the sanitorium windows are burning orange and on this side of the mountain the shadows sneak like burglars into the narrow concrete space between this house and the unsold one. Through the papered walls, from the house of the young barefoot couple, seeps the dull bass percussion of a rock group, making the matched tins (cookies, sugar, flour, coffee) on Mom's shelf tingle in their emptiness. In the living room the glass face of the mahogany sideboard shivers. Nelson's eyes begin to sink, and the buttoned?up cupid?curves of his mouth smile in apology as he slumps forward to rest his head on the cold enamel of the table. His elders talk about old times in the neighborhood, people of the Thirties and Forties, once so alive you saw them every day and never thought to take even a photograph. The old Methodist refusing to mow his half of the grass strip. Before him the Zims with that pretty daughter the mother would shriek at every break-fast and supper. The man down the street who worked nights at the pretzel plant and who shot himself one dawn with nobody to hear it but the horses of the milk wagon. They had milk wagons ?then. Some streets were still soft dust. Nelson fights sleep. Rabbit asks him, "Want to head home?"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"Negative, Pop." He drowsily grins at his own wit.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Rabbit extends the joke. "The time is twenty?one hours. We better rendezvous with our spacecraft."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But the spacecraft is empty: a long empty box in the blackness of Penn Villas, slowly spinning in the void, its border beds half-weeded. The kid is frightened to go home. So is Rabbit. They sit on Mom's bed and watch television in the dark. They are told the men in the big metal spider sitting on the moon cannot sleep, so the moon?walk has been moved up several hours. Men in studios, brittle and tired from killing time, demonstrate with actual?size mockups what is supposed to happen; on some channels men in space suits are walking around, laying down tinfoil trays as if for a cookout. At last it happens. The real event. Or is it? A television camera on the leg of the module comes on: an abstraction appears on the screen. The announcer explains that the blackness in the top of the screen is the lunar night, the blackness in the lower left corner is the shadow of the spacecraft with its ladder, the white-ness is the surface of the moon. Nelson is asleep, his head on his father's thigh; funny how kids' skulls grow damp when they sleep. Like bulbs underground. Mom's legs are under the blankets; she is propped up on pillows behind him. Pop is asleep in his chair, his breathing a distant sad sea, touching shore and retreating, touching shore and retreating, an old pump that keeps going; lamplight sneaks through a crack in the windowshade and touches the top of his head, his sparse hair mussed into lank feathers. On the bright box something is happening. A snaky shape sneaks down from the upper left corner; it is a man's leg. It grows another leg, eclipses the bright patch that is the surface of the moon. A man in clumsy silhouette has interposed himself among these abstract shadows and glare. An Armstrong, but not Jack. He says something about "steps" that a crackle keeps Rabbit from understanding. Electronic letters travelling sideways spell out MAN IS ON THE MOON. The voice, crackling, tells Houston that the surface is fine and powdery, he can pick it up with his toe, it adheres to his boot like powdered charcoal, that he sinks in only a fraction of an inch, that it's easier to move around than in the simulations on Earth. From behind him, Rabbit's mother's hand with difficulty reaches out, touches the back of his skull, stays there, awkwardly tries to massage his scalp, to ease away thoughts of the trouble she knows he is in. "I don't know, Mom," he abruptly admits. "I know it's happened, but I don't feel anything yet."</p>
