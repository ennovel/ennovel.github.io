During that time my powers increased enormously. That night after my return from the Talamasca in England, I tested all of them and made certain that, never again would I be at the mercy of Santino's miscreants. For many nights I left Bianca to herself as I made certain of my advantages.</p><p>And once I was utterly sure of my swiftness, of the Fire Gift, and of an immeasurable power to destroy with invisible force, I went to Paris with no other thought but to spy upon Amadeo's coven.</p><p>Before I left for this little venture, I confessed my goals to Bianca and she had at once beseeched me not to court such danger.</p><p>"No, let me go," I responded. "I could hear his voice now over the miles perhaps if I chose to do it. But I must be certain of what I hear and what I see. And I shall tell you something else. I have no desire to reclaim him."</p><p>She was saddened by this, but she seemed to understand it. She kept her usual place in the corner of the shrine, merely nodding to me and exacting the promise from me that I would be most careful.</p><p>As soon as I reached Paris, I fed from one of several murderers, luring him by the powerful Spell Gift from his place in a comfortable inn, and then I sought refuge in a high bell tower of Notre Dame de Paris itself to listen to the miscreants.</p><p>Indeed, it was a huge nest of the most despicable and hateful beings, and they had sought out a catacomb for their existence in Paris just as they had in ancient Rome centuries ago.</p><p>This catacomb was under the cemetery called Les Innocents, and those words seemed tragically apt when I caught their addle-brained vows and chants before they poured out into the night to bring cruelty as well as death to the people of Paris.</p><p>"All for Satan, all for the Beast, all to serve God, and then return to our penitential existence."</p><p>It was not difficult for me to find, through many different minds, the location of my Amadeo, and within an hour or so of my arrival in Paris, I had him fixed as he walked through a narrow medieval street, never dreaming that I watched him from above in bitter silence.</p><p>He was dressed in rags, his hair caked with filth, and when he found his first victim, he visited upon her a painful death which appalled me.</p><p>For an hour or more my eyes followed him as he proceeded on, feeding on another hapless creature, and then circling back to walk his way to the enormous cemetery.</p><p>Leaning against the cold stone of the tower room, I heard him deep in his underground cell drawing together his "coven" as he himself now called it and demanding of each how he or she had harried, for the love of God, the local population.</p><p>"Children of Darkness, it is almost dawn. Each of you shall now open his or her soul to me."</p><p>How firm, how clear was his voice. How certain he was of what he said. How quick he was to correct any Child of Satan who had not slain mortals ruthlessly. It was a man's voice I heard coming from the lips of the boy I once knew. It was chilling to me.</p><p>"Why were you given the Dark Gift?" he demanded of a laggard. "Tomorrow night you must strike twice. And if all of you do not give me greater devotion, I shall punish you for your sins, and see that others are brought into the coven."</p><p>At last I couldn't listen anymore. I was repelled.</p><p>I dreamt of going down into his underground world, of pulling him out of it as I burnt his followers, and forcing him into the light, of taking him with me to the shrine of Those Who Must Be Kept, and pleading with him to renounce his vocation.</p><p>But I didn't do it. I couldn't do it.</p><p>For years and years, he had been one of them. His mind, his soul, his body belonged to those he ruled; and nothing that I had taught him had given him the strength to fight them.</p><p>He was not my Amadeo anymore. That is what I had come to Paris to learn and now I knew the truth of it.</p><p>I felt sadness. I felt despair. But maybe it was anger and revulsion which caused me to leave Paris that night, saying to myself in essence that he must free himself from the dark mentality of the coven on his own. I could not do it for him.</p><p>I had labored long and hard in Venice to erase his memory of the Monastery of the Caves. And now he had found another place of rigid ritual and denial. And his years with me had not protected him from it. Indeed, a circle had long ago closed for him. He was the priest once more. He was the Fool for Satan, as he had once been the Fool for God in far-away Russia. And his brief time with me in Venice had been nothing.</p><p>When I told these things to Bianca, when I explained them as best I could, she was sad but she didn't press me.</p><p>It was easy between us as always, with her listening to me, and then offering her own response without anger.</p><p>"Perhaps in time, you'll change your mind," she said. "You are the one with the power to go there, to fight those who would restrain him if you tried to take him. And that is what it would require, I think, that you would have to take him by force, insist that he come here to be with you, and see the Divine Parents. I don't possess the power to do these things. I ask only that you think on it, that you make no bitter iron resolve against it."</p><p>"I give you my word," I said, "I have not done that. But I do not think the sight of the Divine Parents would change the heart of Amadeo." I paused.</p><p>I thought on all this for a long moment and then I spoke to her more directly:</p><p>"You've only shared this knowledge with me for a brief time," I said. "And in the Divine Parents we both see great beauty. But Amadeo might well see something different. Remember what I've told you of the long centuries that lie behind me. The Divine Parents do not speak. The Divine Parents do not redeem. The Divine Parents ask for nothing."</p><p>"I understand," she said.</p><p>But she didn't. She had not spent enough years with the King and Queen. She couldn't possibly comprehend the full effect of their passivity.</p><p>But I went on in a mild manner:</p><p>"Amadeo possesses a creed, and a seeming place in God's plan," I said. "He might well see our Mother and Father as an enigma belonging to a pagan era. That wouldn't warm his heart. That wouldn't give him the strength which he derives now from his flock, and believe you me, Bianca, he is the leader there. Our boy of long ago is old now; he is a sage of the Children of Darkness as they call themselves." I sighed.</p><p>A little flash of bitter memory came back to me, of Santino asking me when we met in Rome if Those Who Must Be Kept were holy or profane.</p><p>I told this to Bianca.</p><p>"Ah, then you spoke to this creature. You've never told me this."</p><p>"Oh, yes, I spoke to him and spurned him and insulted him. I did all of these foolish things when something more vicious was required. Indeed, when the very words 'Those Who Must Be Kept' had come from his lips, I should have put an end to him."</p><p>She nodded. "I come more and more to understand it. Yet still I hope in time that you will return to Paris, that you will at least reveal yourself to Amadeo. They are weak ones, are they not, and you could come upon him in some open place where you could&amp;iexcl;&amp;ordf;."</p><p>"I know well what you mean to say," I answered. "I wouldn't allow myself ever to be surrounded by torches. Perhaps I will do as you suggest. But I've heard Amadeo's voice, and I don't believe he can be changed now. And there is one thing more which is worth mentioning. Amadeo knows how to free himself from this coven."</p><p>"Are you sure?"</p><p>"Yes, I am. Amadeo knows how to live in the lighted world, and he is ten times stronger by virtue of my old blood than are those who listen to his commands. He could break away. He chooses not to do it."</p><p>"Marius," she said plaintively, "you know how much I love you and how loath I am to contradict you."</p><p>"No, say what you must say," I urged her at once.</p><p>"Think of what he suffered," she said. "He was but a child when it happened."</p><p>I agreed to all this. Then I spoke again:</p><p>"Well, he's no child now, Bianca. He may be as beautiful as he was when I made him through the Blood, but he is a patriarch in the dust. And all of Paris, the wondrous city of Paris, surrounds him. I watched him move through the city streets alone. There was no one there to restrict him. He might have sought the Evil Doer as we do. But he did not. He drank deep of innocent blood, not once but twice."</p><p>"Ah, I see. This is what has so embittered you."</p><p>I thought on it.</p><p>"Yes, you're right. It's what turned me away, though I didn't even know it. I thought it was the manner in which he spoke to his flock. But you are right. It was those two deaths, from which he drew his hot red feast, when Paris swarmed with mortals steeped in murder who might easily have been slain by him."</p><p>She laid her hand on mine.</p><p>"If I choose to snatch any one of these Children of Darkness from his lair," I said, "it is Santino."</p><p>"No, but you mustn't go to Rome. You don't know whether or not there are old ones among that coven."</p><p>"Some night," I said, "some night I shall go there. When I am more certain of immense power, and when I am more certain of the ruthless rage it requires to destroy many others."</p><p>"Be still now," she said. "Forgive me."</p><p>I was quiet for a moment.</p><p>She knew how many nights I had wandered alone. I had now to confess what I had been doing on those nights. I had now to begin my secret plan. I had now&amp;iexcl;&amp;ordf;for the first time in all our years together&amp;iexcl;&amp;ordf;to drive a wedge between her and me, while giving her precisely what she wanted.</p><p>"But let's leave talk of Amadeo," I said. "My mind is on happier things."</p><p>She was immediately interested. She reached out and stroked my face and hair as was her custom.</p><p>"Tell me."</p><p>"How long has it been since you asked me if we could have our own dwelling?"</p><p>"Oh, Marius, don't tease me on this account. Is it possible!"</p><p>"My darling, it's more than possible," I said, warmed by her beaming smile. "I have found a splendid place, a lovely little city on the Elbe River in Saxony."</p><p>For this I received the sweetest kiss.</p><p>"Now in these many nights when I have been off on my own, I have taken the liberty of acquiring a castle near the city, a much decayed place, and I hope you'll forgive me&amp;iexcl;&amp;ordf;."</p><p>"Marius, this is momentous news!" she said.</p><p>"I have already spent a considerable sum for the repairs&amp;iexcl;&amp;ordf;the new wooden floors and stairs, glass windows, and abundant furnishings."</p><p>"Oh, but this is wonderful," she said. She put her arms around me.</p><p>"I'm relieved that you're not angry with me," I said, "for moving so quickly without you. You might say I fell in love with the place, and taking several drapers and carpenters there I told them my dreams and now all is being done as I have directed."</p><p>"Oh, how could I be angry?" she said. "I want it more than anything in the world."</p><p>"There is one more aspect to this castle which I should disclose," I said. "Though the more modern building above is more like a palace than a castle, its foundations are quite old. Indeed, a major part of the foundations were built in early times. And there are huge crypts beneath it, and a true dungeon."</p><p>"You mean to move the Divine Parents?" she asked. "I do. I think it's time for it. You know as well as I that there are small cities and towns springing up all around us. We aren't isolated here. Yes, I want to move the Divine Parents."</p><p>"If you say, of course, I go along with you." She was too happy to conceal it. "But is it safe there? Didn't you remove them to this remote place so that you never had to fear their discovery?" I thought on this for a while before answering. At last I said:</p><p>"It is safe there. And with the passing centuries, the world of the Undead changes around us. And I can't endure this place any longer. And so I take them to a new place. And there are no blood drinkers in it. I have searched far and wide for them. They aren't there. I hear no young ones. I hear no old ones. I believe it's safe. And perhaps the most true answer to that logic is this: I want to bring them there. I want a new place. I want new mountains and new forests."</p><p>"I understand," she said. "Oh, I do understand," she said again. "And more than ever, I believe that they can defend themselves. Oh, they need you, I don't doubt it, and that's why on that long ago night they opened the door for you and lighted the lamps. I can still remember it so vividly. But I spend long hours here simply gazing at them. And I have many thoughts during these hours. And I believe that they would defend themselves against any who sought to hurt them."</p><p>I didn't argue with her. I didn't bother to remind her that centuries ago they had allowed themselves to be placed in the sun. What was the purpose? And for all I knew she was right. They would crush anyone who tried to subject them to such injury.</p><p>"Come now," she said, seeing me fallen into a mood. "I'm too happy with this good news. Be happy with me."</p><p>She kissed me as if she couldn't stop herself. She was so innocent in those moments.</p><p>And I, I was lying to her, truly lying to her for the first time in all our years together.</p><p>I was lying because I hadn't told her a word of Pandora. I was lying because I didn't truly believe that she could harbor no jealousy of Pandora.</p><p>And because I couldn't tell her that my love for Pandora lay at the very heart of what I did. What creature would want to reveal such a scheme to a lover?</p><p>I meant to place us in Dresden. I meant to remain in Dresden. I meant to be near Dresden at every sunset of my existence until such time as Pandora came again. And I could not tell this to Bianca.</p><p>And so I pretended that it was for her that I had chosen this beautiful home, and indeed it was for her, there is no doubt of it. It was for her to make her happy, yes. But that was not all of it.</p><p>Within the month, we began work on the new shrine, utterly transforming the castle dungeon in Saxony into a fit place for the King and Queen.</p><p>Goldsmiths and painters and stone masons were brought down the many flights of stone steps to enhance the dungeon until it was the most marvelous private chapel.</p><p>The throne was covered in gold leaf as was the dais.</p><p>And once again, the proper bronze lamps were found, fresh and new. And there were rich candelabra of gold and silver.</p><p>I alone labored on the heavy iron doors and their complex fastenings.</p><p>As for the castle, it was more of a palace than a castle, as I've said, having been rebuilt several times, and it was charming in its placement above the banks of the Elbe, and it had around it a lovely forest of beech, oak and birch trees. There was a terrace from which one could look down at the river, and from many large windows, one could see the distant city of Dresden.</p><p>Of course we would never hunt in Dresden or in the surrounding hamlets. We would go far afield as had always been our custom. And we would waylay the forest brigands, an activity which had become a regular sport for us.</p><p>Bianca had some concerns. And only reluctantly she confessed to me that she had some fear of living in a place where she could not hunt for herself without me.</p><p>"Dresden is big enough to serve your appetite," I said, "if I were not able to carry you elsewhere. You'll see. It's a beautiful city, a young city I should say, but under the Duke of Saxony it's coming along magnificently."</p><p>"You're sure of this," she asked.</p><p>"Oh, yes, I'm sure of it, and as I've told you, I'm also sure that the forests of Saxony and nearby Thuringia contain their number of murderous thieves who have always been such a special repast for us."</p><p>She thought on all this.</p><p>"Let me remind you, my darling," I said, "you can on any night cut your beautiful blond hair with the full confidence that it will grow back by day, and you can go out clothed as a man, traveling with preternatural speed and strength to hunt your victims. Perhaps we should play at this very soon after our arrival."</p><p>"Yes, would you allow me this?" she asked.</p><p>"Of course, I shall." I was astonished by her gratitude.</p><p>Again she showered me with grateful kisses.</p><p>"But I must caution you on something," I said. "The area to which we move has many small villages, and in these the belief in witchcraft and vampires is quite strong."</p><p>"Vampires," she said. "This is the word used by your friend in the Talamasca."</p><p>"Yes," I replied. "We must always cover the evidence of our feast, lest we become an immediate legend."</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>Finally the castle or schloss as they were called in that part of the world was ready, and it was time for us to make preparations.</p><p>But something else had come to my mind, and I was haunted by it.</p><p>Finally there came a night when as Bianca slept in her corner, I proposed to deal with this matter.</p><p>I knelt down on the bare marble and prayed to my motionless and beautiful Akasha and asked her in most specific words if she would allow Bianca to drink from her.</p><p>"This tender one has been your companion these many years," I said, "and she has loved you without reserve. I give her my strong blood over and over again. But what is my blood in comparison to yours? I fear for her, if ever we were to be separated. Please let her drink. Give her your precious strength."</p><p>Only the sweet silence followed, with the shimmering of so many tiny flames, with the scent of wax and oil, with the glitter of light in the Queen's eyes.</p><p>But I saw an image in answer to my prayer. I saw in my mind my lovely Bianca lying on the breast of the Queen. And for one divine instant we were not in the shrine but in a great garden. I felt the breeze sweeping through the trees. I smelled flowers.</p><p>Then I was in the shrine again, kneeling, with my arms out.</p><p>At once I whispered and gestured for Bianca to come to me. She obeyed, having no idea of what was in my mind, and I guided her up close to the throat of the Queen, covering her as I did so that if Enkil were to lift his arm I would feel it.</p><p>"Kiss her throat," I whispered.</p><p>Bianca was shivering. I think she was on the verge of tears, but she did as I told her to do, and then I saw her sink her small fang teeth into the skin of the Queen, and I felt her body become rigid beneath my embrace.</p><p>It was being accomplished.</p>       <amp-ad

          </amp-ad><p>For several long moments she drank, and it seemed I could hear their heartbeats struggling against each other, one great and one small, and then Bianca fell back, and I gathered her up in my arms, seeing the two tiny wounds heal in Akasha's throat.</p><p>It was finished.</p><p>Withdrawing to the corner, I held Bianca close to me.</p><p>She gave several sighs and undulated and turned towards me and snuggled against me. Then she held out her hand and looked at it, and we could both see that it was whiter now, though it still had the color of human flesh.</p><p>My soul was wondrously soothed by this event. I am only confessing now what it meant to me. For having lied to Bianca I lived with an unbearable guilt, and now, having given her this gift of the Mother's blood I felt a huge measure of relief from it.</p><p>It was my hope that the Mother would allow Bianca to drink again, and in fact this did happen. It happened often. And with every draught of the Divine Blood Bianca became immensely stronger.</p><p>But let me proceed with the tale in order.</p><p>The journey from the shrine was arduous. As in the past I had to rely on mortals to transport the Divine Parents in heavy coffins of stone, and I experienced some trepidation. But not as much as in former eras. I think I was convinced that Akasha and Enkil could protect themselves.</p><p>I don't know what gave me this impression. Perhaps it was that they had opened the shrine for me, and lighted the lamps when I had been so weak and miserable.</p><p>Whatever the case, they were carried to our new home without difficulty, and as Bianca gazed on in complete awe, I took them out of their coffins and placed them on the throne together.</p><p>Their slow obedient movements, their sluggish plasticity&amp;iexcl;&amp;ordf;these things faintly horrified her.</p><p>But as she had now drunk the Mother's blood, she was quick to join me in adjusting her fine spun dress and Enkil's kilt. She helped me to smooth the plaited hair. She helped me to adjust the Queen's bracelets.</p><p>When it was all done, I myself tended to the lamps and the candles.</p><p>Then we both knelt down to pray that the King and the Queen were content to be in this new place.</p><p>And after that we were off to find the brigands in the forest. We had already heard their voices. We quickly picked up their scent, and soon it was fine feasting in the woods, and a stash of stolen gold to make it all the more splendid.</p><p>We were back in the world, Bianca declared. She danced in circles in the great hall of the castle. She delighted in all the furnishings that crowded our new rooms. She delighted in our fancy coffered beds, and all the colored draperies. I too delighted in it.</p><p>But we were in full agreement that we would not live in the world as I had lived in Venice. Such was simply too dangerous. And so having but few servants, we kept entirely to ourselves, and the rumors in Dresden were that our house belonged to a Lady and Lord who lived elsewhere.</p><p>When it pleased us to visit great cathedrals&amp;iexcl;&amp;ordf;and there were many&amp;iexcl;&amp;ordf;or great Royal Courts, we went some distance from our home&amp;iexcl;&amp;ordf;to other cities such as Weimar, or Eisenbach, or Leipzig-and cloaked ourselves in absurd wealth and mystery. It was all quite comforting after our barren life in the Alps. And we enjoyed it immensely.</p><p>But at every sunset my eyes were fixed on Dresden. At every sunset I listened for the sound of a powerful blood drinker&amp;iexcl;&amp;ordf;in Dresden.</p><p>And so the years passed.</p><p>With them came radical changes in clothes which greatly amused us. We were soon wearing elaborate wigs which we found ridiculous. And how I despised the pants which soon came into style, as well as the high-heeled shoes and white stockings which came into fashion with them.</p><p>We could not in our quiet seclusion include enough maids for Bianca, so it was I who laced up her tight corset. But what a vision she was in her low-breasted bodices and her broad swaying panniers.</p><p>During this time, I wrote many times to the Talamasca. Raymond died at the age of eighty-nine, but I soon established a connection there with a young woman named Elizabeth Nollis who had for her personal review my letters to Raymond.</p><p>She confirmed for me that Pandora was still seen with her Asian companion. She begged to know what I might tell of my own powers and habits, but on this I was not too revealing. I spoke of mind reading and the defiance of gravity. But I drove her to distraction with my lack of specifics.</p><p>The greatest and most mysterious success of these letters was that she told me much of the Talamasca. They were rich beyond anyone's dreams, she said, and this was the source of their immense freedom. They had recently set up a Motherhouse in Amsterdam, and also in the city of Rome.</p><p>I was quite surprised by all this, and warned her of Santino's "coven."</p><p>She then sent me a reply that astonished me.</p><p>"It seems now that those strange ladies and gentlemen of which we have written in the past are no longer within the city in which they dwelt with such obvious pleasure. Indeed it is very difficult for our Motherhouse there to find any reports of such activities as one might expect from these people."</p><p>What did this mean? Had Santino abandoned his coven? Had they gone on to Paris en masse? And if so, why?</p><p>Without explaining myself to my quiet Bianca&amp;iexcl;&amp;ordf;who was more and more hunting on her own&amp;iexcl;&amp;ordf;I went off to explore the Holy City myself, coming upon it for the first time in two hundred years.</p><p>I was wary, in fact, a good deal more wary, than I should want to admit to anyone. Indeed, the fear of fire gripped me so dreadfully that when I arrived I could do nothing but keep to the very top of St. Peter's Basilica and look out over Rome with cold, shame-filled eyes; unable for long moments to hear with my blood drinker's ears no matter how I struggled to gain control of myself.</p><p>But I soon satisfied myself, through the Mind Gift, that there were only a few blood drinkers to be found in Rome, and these were lone hunters without the consolation of companions. They were also weak. And as I raped their minds, I realized they knew little of Santino!</p><p>How had this come about? How had this one who had destroyed so much of my life freed himself from his own miserable existence?</p><p>Full of rage, I drew close to one of these lone blood drinkers, and soon accosted him, terrifying him and with reason.</p><p>"What of Santino and the Roman coven?" I demanded. "Gone, all gone," he said, "years ago. Who are you that you know of such things?"</p><p>"Santino!" I said. "Where did he go! Tell me." "But no one knows the answer," he said. "I never laid eyes on him." "But someone made you," I said. "Tell me."</p><p>"My maker lives in the catacombs still where the coven used to gather. He's mad. He can't help you."</p><p>"Prepare to meet God or the Devil," I said. And just that quick I put an end to him. I did it as mercifully as I could. And then he was no more but a spot of grease in the dirt and in this I rubbed my foot before I moved towards the catacombs. He had spoken the truth.</p><p>There was but one blood drinker in this place, but I found it full of skulls just as it had been over a thousand years ago.</p><p>The blood drinker was a babbling fool, and when he saw me in my fine gentleman's clothes, he stared at me and pointed his finger. "The Devil comes in style," he said.</p><p>"No, death has come," I said. "Why did you make that other one whom I've destroyed this night?"</p><p>My confession made no impression on him.</p><p>"I make others to be my companions. But what good does it do? They turn on me."</p><p>"Where is Santino?" I demanded.</p><p>"Long gone," he said. "And who would have ever thought?" I tried to read his mind, but he was too crazed and full of distracted thoughts. It was like chasing scattered mice. "Look at me, when did you last see him!"</p><p>"Oh, decades ago," he said. "I don't know the year. What do years mean here?"</p><p>I could get nothing further from him. I looked about the miserable place with its few candles dripping wax upon yellowed skulls, and then turning on this creature I destroyed him with the Fire Gift as mercifully as I had destroyed the other. And I do think that it was truly a mercy.</p><p>There was but one left, and this one led a far better existence than the other two. I found him in handsome lodgings an hour before sunrise. With little difficulty I learnt that he kept a hiding place beneath the house, but that he spent his idle hours reading in his few well-appointed rooms, and that he dressed tolerably well.</p><p>I also learnt that he couldn't detect my presence. He cut the figure of a man of some thirty mortal years, and he had been in the Blood for some three hundred.</p><p>At last I opened his door, breaking the lock, and stepped before him as he stood up, in horror, from his writing desk.</p><p>"Santino," I said, "what became of him?"</p><p>Though he had fed like a glutton, he was gaunt with huge bones, and long black hair, and though he was very finely dressed in the style of the i6oos, his lace was soiled and dusty.</p><p>"In the name of Hell," he whispered, "who are you? Where do you come from?"</p><p>Again there came that terrific confusion of mind which defeated my ability to subtract thoughts or knowledge from it.</p><p>"I'll satisfy you on those points," I said, "but you must answer me first. Santino. What happened to him."</p><p>I took several deliberate steps towards him which put him into a paroxysm of terror.</p><p>"Be quiet now," I said. Again I tried to read his mind, but I failed. "Don't try to flee," I said. "You won't succeed with it. Answer my questions."</p><p>"I'll tell you what I know," he said, fearfully.</p><p>"That ought to be plenty."</p><p>He shook his head. "I came here from Paris," he said. He was quaking. "I was sent by a vampire named Armand who is the leader of that coven."</p><p>I nodded as though all this were quite intelligible to me, and as though I weren't experiencing agony.</p><p>"That was a hundred years ago, maybe more. Armand had heard no word from Rome in a long time. I came to see the where and why of it. I found the Roman coven in complete confusion."</p><p>He stopped, catching his breath, backing away from me.</p><p>"Speak quickly and tell me more," I said. "I'm impatient."</p><p>"Only if you swear on your honor that you won't harm me. I've done you no harm after all. I was no child of Santino."</p><p>"What makes you think I have honor?" I asked.</p><p>"I know you do," he said. "I can sense such things. Swear on your honor to me and I'll tell you everything."</p><p>"Very well, I swear. I'll leave you alive which is more than I've done with two others tonight who haunted the Roman streets like ghosts. Now talk to me."</p><p>"I came from Paris as I told you. The Roman coven was weak. All ceremony had fallen away. One or two of the old ones had deliberately gone into the fire. Others had simply run away, and Santino had made no move to catch them and punish them. Once it was known that such escape was possible many more fled, and the coven was in a state of disaster."</p><p>"Santino, did you see him?"</p><p>"Yes, I saw him. He had taken to dressing in fine clothes and jewels, and he received me in a palazzo much larger than this one. He told me strange things. I can't really remember all of them."</p><p>"You must remember."</p><p>"He said he had seen old ones, too many old ones, and his faith in Satan had been shaken. He spoke of creatures who seemed to be made of marble, though he knew they could burn. He said he could no longer lead. He told me not to return to Paris, to do as I pleased, and so I have."</p><p>"Old ones," I said, repeating his words. "Did he tell you nothing of these old ones?"</p><p>"He spoke of the great Marius, and of a creature named Mael. And he spoke of beautiful women."</p><p>"What were the names of these women?"</p><p>"He didn't say their names to me. He said only that one had come to the coven on the night of its ceremonial dance, a woman like a living statue, and she had walked through the fire to show that it was useless against her. She had destroyed many of the fledglings who attacked her.</p><p>"When Santino showed attention and patience, she talked with him for several nights, telling him of her wanderings. He had no taste for the coven after that...</p><p>"... But it was the other woman who truly destroyed him."</p><p>"And who was this?" I demanded. "You can't speak fast enough for me."</p><p>"The other woman was of the world, dressing in high style, and traveling by coach in the company of a dark-skinned Asian."</p><p>I was dumbstruck, and maddened that he said nothing more.</p><p>"What happened with this other woman?" I finally asked, though a thousand other words flooded my mind.</p><p>"Santino wanted her love most desperately. Of course the Asian threatened him with pure destruction if he didn't give up this course, but it was the woman's condemnations that ruined him."</p><p>"What condemnations, what did she say and why?" I demanded.</p><p>"I'm not certain. Santino spoke to her of his old piety and his fervor in directing the coven. She condemned him. She said time would punish him for what he'd done to his own kind. She turned away from him in disgust with him."</p><p>I smiled, a bitter smile.</p><p>"Do you understand these things?" he asked. "Are they what you wanted?"</p><p>"Oh, yes, I understand them," I said.</p><p>I turned and went to the window. I unfastened the wooden shutter, and stood looking down into the street.</p><p>I saw nothing, but I couldn't reason.</p><p>"What became of the woman and her Asian companion?" I asked.</p><p>"I don't know. I have seen them in Rome since. Maybe it was fifty years ago. They are easy to recognize, for she is very pale and her companion has a creamy brown skin and while she dresses always as the great lady, he tends toward the exotic."</p><p>I took a deep easy breath.</p><p>"And Santino? Where did he go?" I demanded.</p><p>"That I can't tell you, except that he had no spirit for anything when I talked to him. He wanted her love, and nothing else. He said the ancient ones had ruined him for immortality and frightened him as to death. He had nothing."</p><p>I took another deep breath. Then I turned around and fixed this vampire in my gaze with all his considerable details.</p><p>"Listen to me," I said. "If you ever see this creature again, the great lady who travels by coach, you must tell her one thing for me and one thing alone."</p><p>"Very well."</p><p>"That Marius lives and Marius is searching for her."</p><p>"Marius!" he said with a gasp. He looked at me respectfully, though his eyes measured me from head to foot, and then hesitantly he said, "But Santino believes you to be dead. I think that this is what he told to the woman, that he had sent the coven members North to hurt you."</p><p>"I think it's what he told her too. Now you remember that you saw me alive and that I search for her."</p><p>"But where can she find you?"</p><p>"I can't entrust that knowledge to you," I said. "I would be foolish to do it. But remember what I have said. If you see her speak to her."</p><p>"Very well," he answered. "I hope that you find her."</p><p>With no further words, I left him.</p><p>I went out then into the night and for a long time I roamed the streets of Rome, taking stock of how it had changed with the centuries and how so much had remained the same.</p><p>I marveled at the relics from my time which were still standing. I treasured the few hours I had to make my way through the ruins of the Colosseum and the Forum. I climbed the hill where I had once lived. I found some blocks still from old walls of my house. I wandered in a daze, staring at things because my brain was in a fever.</p><p>In truth I could hardly contain my excitement on account of what I had heard, and yet I was miserable that Santino had escaped me.</p><p>But oh, what a rich irony it was that he had fallen in love with her! That she had denied him! And to think he had confessed to her his murderous deeds, how loathsome. Had he been boasting when he spoke with her?</p><p>Finally my heart was under my control. I could endure with what I had learnt from the young vampire. I would soon come upon Pandora, I knew it.</p><p>As for the other ancient one, she who had walked through the fire, I could not then imagine who it was though I think I know now. Indeed, I'm almost certain of it. I wonder what pulled her out of her secretive ways to visit some merciful release upon Santino's followers.</p><p>At last the night was almost spent, and I went home to be with my ever patient Bianca.</p><p>When I came down the stone steps of the cellar, I found her asleep against her coffin as if she'd been waiting for me. She was in a long nightgown of sheer white silk, tied at the wrists, and her hair was glossy and flowing.</p><p>I lifted her, kissed her closing eyes, and then put her down to her rest, and kissed her again as she lay there.</p><p>"Did you find Santino?" she asked in a drowsy voice. "Did you punish him?"</p><p>"No," I said. "But I will some night in the years to come. Only time itself can rob me of that special pleasure."</p> </div> </div> <div class="row turn-page"> <a class="col-xs-2" href="/Blood%20And%20Gold%20(The%20Vampire%20Chronicles%20%238)/30.html?v=1662298613445">Previous</a> <a class="col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:center;" href="/Blood%20And%20Gold%20(The%20Vampire%20Chronicles%20%238)/book.html?v=1662298613443">Table</a> <a class="col-xs-2 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:right;" href="/Blood%20And%20Gold%20(The%20Vampire%20Chronicles%20%238)/32.html?v=1662298613447"> Next</a> </div> <hr></div><hr><footer class="container"> <p>© Company 2014</p></footer><amp-lightbox id="searchLightbox" class="-il" layout="nodisplay" on="lightboxOpen:searchInput.focus; lightboxClose:searchTriggerOpen.focus" scrollable="" hidden="hidden"> <div> <div class="-ic" role="button" tabindex="0" on="tap:searchLightbox.close"></div> <div class="-ih"> <div class="-sg -sb" on="tap: searchLightbox.close, AMP.setState({ query: '' }), searchForm.clear" role="button" tabindex="0"> <div class="ap-a-ico -sw"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#close"></use> </svg> </div> </div> <div class="ap-o-search-field"> <form action="#" action-xhr="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/echo" class="-ip" id="searchForm" on="submit:AMP.setState({ query: throttledValue }),searchResult.focus" target="_top"> <amp-autocomplete class="-id" filter="substring" min-characters="1" on="select:AMP.setState({ query: event.value })" submit-on-enter="false" src="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/autosuggest"> <div class="ap-a-ico -im"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#search"></use> </svg> </div> <input id="searchInput" class="-iv" name="q" placeholder="What are you looking for?" on="input-throttled:AMP.setState({ throttledValue: event.value })" required=""> <button class="-ig" type="submit" name="search-submit" disabled="" [disabled]="!throttledValue">Search </button> <div role="listbox"></div> </amp-autocomplete> </form> <div class="empty" [class]="query ?
