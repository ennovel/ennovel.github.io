<br> 
<br> “If eggs are up,” says she, “I’ll be gaining a handful of silver, and evenly if prices be down I’ll not do too badly at all for I have a weighty supply.”
<br> 
<br> With that she remarked a little wee boy sitting down by the hedge, he stitching away at a brogue.
<br> 
<br> “If I had a hold of yon lad,” says she, “I’d make him discover a treasure—for the like of him knows where gold does be hid.”
<br> 
<br> She juked up behind him, like a cat would be after a bird, and she caught a strong grip of his neck. [180]
<br> 
<br> Well he let an odious screech out of him, for he was horrid surprised.
<br> 
<br> “I have you, my gosoon,” says she.
<br> 
<br> “Oh surely you have, mam,” he answers. “The strength of your thumb is destroying my thrapple this day.”
<br> 
<br> “Will you show me a treasure?” says she.
<br> 
<br> “I’d have you to know,” he replies, “that the pot of gold I could convey you in sight of is guarded by the appearance of a very strange frog.”
<br> 
<br> “What do I care for the creeping beasts of the world,” says she. “Worse nor a frog wouldn’t scare me at all.”
<br> 
<br> “You’re a terrible fine woman, mistress dear,” says the leprachaun. “I’ve travelled a power of the earth and I never came in with your equal.”
<br> 
<br> “Go on with your old-fashioned chat,” she replies, but she was middling well pleased all the same.
<br> 
<br> “I’m a small little fellow,” says he, “and I couldn’t keep up with yourself. But it’s light in the body I am, the way I’d be never a burden at all and I sitting up on the handle of the basket.”
<br> 
<br> “Up with you,” she answers, “for I’ll [181]soon put you down to walk by my side if you are not speaking the truth.”
<br> 
<br> But she didn’t find the least burden more on the basket when himself was on the handle.
<br> 
<br> He was a great warrant to flatter, and he had her in humour that day all the while he was watching out for a chance to escape, but she kept a hold of his ear.
<br> 
<br> What did he do only put his two wee hands down into the basket and he began for to bail out the eggs. She fetched him a terrible clout, but the harder she beat him the faster he threw out the eggs.
<br> 
<br> “Oh mam! oh mam!” says he, “what for are you skelping my head?”
<br> 
<br> “To make you quit breaking my eggs, you unmannerly coley,” says she.
<br> 
<br> “Sure it’s doing you favour I am,” he replies. “I’d have you to know when I spill an egg on the ground a well-grown spring chicken leps out.”
<br> 
<br> “Quit raving,” says she.
<br> 
<br> “If you doubt my word,” he makes answer, “let you turn and look back at the chickens are flocking along.”
<br> 
<br> With that she turned her head, and the [182]leprachaun slipped from her grasp. He made one spring from the basket into the hedge, and he vanished away from the place.
<br> 
<br> “The wee lad has fooled me entirely,” says she, “and my beautiful eggs are destroyed—but I am the finest woman he’s seen, and that is a good thing to know!”
