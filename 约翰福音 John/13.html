<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now before the feast of the Passover, it was clear to Jesus that the time had come for him to go away from this world to the Father. Having once had love for those in the world who were his, his love for them went on to the end.
<br>13:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;吃 晚 饭 的 时 候 ， （ 魔 鬼 已 将 卖 耶 稣 的 意 思 ， 放 在 西 门 的 儿 子 加 略 人 犹 大 心 里 ） 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So while a meal was going on, the Evil One having now put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to be false to him,
<br>13:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 知 道 父 已 将 万 有 交 在 他 手 里 ， 且 知 道 自 己 是 从 神 出 来 的 ， 又 要 归 到 神 那 里 去 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus, being conscious that the Father had put everything into his hands, and that he came from God and was going to God,
<br>13:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 离 席 站 起 来 脱 了 衣 服 ， 拿 一 条 手 巾 束 腰 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Got up from table, put off his robe and took a cloth and put it round him.
<br>13:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;随 后 把 水 倒 在 盆 里 ， 就 洗 门 徒 的 脚 ， 并 用 自 己 所 束 的 手 巾 擦 干 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then he put water into a basin and was washing the feet of the disciples and drying them with the cloth which was round him.
<br>13:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;挨 到 西 门 彼 得 ， 彼 得 对 他 说 ， 主 阿 ， 你 洗 我 的 脚 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So he came to Simon Peter. Peter said, Lord, are my feet to be washed by you?
<br>13:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 我 所 作 的 ， 你 如 今 不 知 道 ， 后 来 必 明 白 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus, answering, said to him, What I do is not clear to you now, but it will be clear to you in time to come.
<br>13:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 说 ， 你 永 不 可 洗 我 的 脚 。 耶 稣 说 ， 我 若 不 洗 你 ， 你 就 与 我 无 分 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Peter said, I will never let my feet be washed by you, never. Jesus said in answer, If I do not make you clean you have no part with me.
<br>13:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;西 门 彼 得 说 ， 主 阿 ， 不 但 我 的 脚 ， 连 手 和 头 也 要 洗 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Simon Peter said to him, Lord, not my feet only, but my hands and my head.
<br>13:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 凡 洗 过 澡 的 人 ， 只 要 把 脚 一 洗 ， 全 身 就 干 净 了 。 你 们 是 干 净 的 ， 然 而 不 都 是 干 净 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus said to him, He who is bathed has need only to have his feet washed and then he is clean all over: and you, my disciples, are clean, but not all of you.
<br>13:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 原 知 道 要 卖 他 的 是 谁 ， 所 以 说 ， 你 们 不 都 是 干 净 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;(He had knowledge who was false to him; that is why he said, You are not all clean.)
<br>13:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 洗 完 了 他 们 的 脚 ， 就 穿 上 衣 服 ， 又 坐 下 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 我 向 你 们 所 作 的 ， 你 们 明 白 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then, after washing their feet and putting on his robe again, he took his seat and said to them, Do you see what I have done to you?
<br>13:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 称 呼 我 夫 子 ， 称 呼 我 主 ， 你 们 说 的 不 错 。 我 本 来 是 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;You give me the name of Master and Lord: and you are right; that is what I am.
<br>13:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 是 你 们 的 主 ， 你 们 的 夫 子 ， 尚 且 洗 你 们 的 脚 ， 你 们 也 当 彼 此 洗 脚 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;If then I, the Lord and the Master, have made your feet clean, it is right for you to make one another's feet clean.
<br>13:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 给 你 们 作 了 榜 样 ， 叫 你 们 照 着 我 向 你 们 所 作 的 去 作 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;I have given you an example, so that you may do what I have done to you.
<br>13:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 实 实 在 在 地 告 诉 你 们 ， 仆 人 不 能 大 于 主 人 。 差 人 也 不 能 大 于 差 他 的 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Truly I say to you, A servant is not greater than his lord; and he who is sent is not greater than the one who sent him.
<br>13:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 既 知 道 这 事 ， 若 是 去 行 就 有 福 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;If these things are clear to you, happy are you if you do them.
<br>13:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 这 话 不 是 指 着 你 们 众 人 说 的 。 我 知 道 我 所 拣 选 的 是 谁 。 现 在 要 应 验 经 上 的 话 ， 说 ， 同 我 吃 饭 的 人 ， 用 脚 踢 我 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;I am not talking of you all: I have knowledge of my true disciples, but things are as they are, so that the Writings may come true, The foot of him who takes bread with me is lifted up against me.
<br>13:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;如 今 事 情 还 没 有 成 就 ， 我 要 先 告 诉 你 们 ， 叫 你 们 到 事 情 成 就 的 时 候 ， 可 以 信 我 是 基 督
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;From this time forward, I give you knowledge of things before they come about, so that when they come about you may have belief that I am he.
<br>13:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 实 实 在 在 地 告 诉 你 们 ， 有 人 接 待 我 所 差 遣 的 ， 就 是 接 待 我 。 接 待 我 ， 就 是 接 待 那 差 遣 我 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Truly I say to you, He who takes to his heart anyone whom I send, takes me to his heart; and he who so takes me, takes him who sent me.
<br>13:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 了 这 话 ， 心 里 忧 愁 ， 就 明 说 ， 我 实 实 在 在 地 告 诉 你 们 ， 你 们 中 间 有 一 个 人 要 卖 我 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;When Jesus had said this he was troubled in spirit, and gave witness, saying, Truly I say to you, that one of you will be false to me.
<br>13:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;门 徒 彼 此 对 看 ， 猜 不 透 所 说 的 是 谁 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then the eyes of the disciples were turned on one another, in doubt as to whom he had in mind.
<br>13:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 一 个 门 徒 ， 是 耶 稣 所 爱 的 ， 侧 身 挨 近 耶 稣 的 怀 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;There was at table one of his disciples, the one dear to Jesus, resting his head on Jesus' breast.
<br>13:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;西 门 彼 得 点 头 对 他 说 ， 你 告 诉 我 们 ， 主 是 指 着 谁 说 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Making a sign to him, Simon Peter said, Who is it he is talking about?
<br>13:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 门 徒 便 就 势 靠 着 耶 稣 的 胸 膛 ， 问 他 说 ， 主 阿 ， 是 谁 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He, then, resting his head on Jesus' breast, said to him, Lord, who is it?
<br>13:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 我 蘸 一 点 饼 给 谁 ， 就 是 谁 。 耶 稣 就 蘸 了 一 点 饼 ， 递 给 加 略 人 西 门 的 儿 子 犹 大 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;This was the answer Jesus gave: It is the one to whom I will give this bit of bread after I have put it in the vessel. Then he took the bit of bread, put it into the vessel, and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.
<br>13:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 吃 了 以 后 ， 撒 但 就 入 了 他 的 心 。 耶 稣 便 对 他 说 ， 你 所 作 的 快 作 吧 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when Judas took the bread Satan went into him. Then Jesus said to him, Do quickly what you have to do.
<br>13:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;同 席 的 人 ， 没 有 一 个 知 道 是 为 什 么 对 他 说 这 话 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now it was not clear to anyone at table why he said this to him.
<br>13:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 人 因 犹 大 带 着 钱 囊 ， 以 为 耶 稣 是 对 他 说 ， 你 去 买 我 们 过 节 所 应 用 的 东 西 。 或 是 叫 他 拿 什 么 周 济 穷 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Some were of the opinion that because Judas kept the money-bag Jesus said to him, Get the things we have need of for the feast; or, that he was to give something to the poor.
<br>13:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;犹 大 受 了 那 点 饼 ， 立 刻 就 出 去 。 那 时 候 是 夜 间 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So Judas, having taken the bit of bread, straight away went out: and it was night.
<br>13:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 既 出 去 ， 耶 稣 就 说 ， 如 今 人 子 得 了 荣 耀 ， 神 在 人 子 身 上 也 得 了 荣 耀 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then when he had gone out, Jesus said, Now is glory given to the Son of man, and God is given glory in him.
<br>13:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;神 要 因 自 己 荣 耀 人 子 ， 并 且 要 快 快 地 荣 耀 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;If God is given glory in him, God will give him glory in himself, and will give him glory even now.
<br>13:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;小 子 们 ， 我 还 有 不 多 的 时 候 ， 与 你 们 同 在 。 后 来 你 们 要 找 我 ， 但 我 所 去 的 地 方 ， 你 们 不 能 到 。 这 话 我 曾 对 犹 太 人 说 过 ， 如 今 也 照 样 对 你 们 说 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;My dear children, I am only to be with you a little longer. Then you will be looking for me: and as I said to the Jews, so now I say to you, Where I am going you may not come.
<br>13:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 赐 给 你 们 一 条 新 命 令 ， 乃 是 叫 你 们 彼 此 相 爱 。 我 怎 样 爱 你 们 ， 你 们 也 要 怎 样 相 爱 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;I give you a new law: Have love one for another; even as I have had love for you, so are you to have love one for another.
<br>13:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 若 有 彼 此 相 爱 的 心 ， 众 人 因 此 就 认 出 你 们 是 我 的 门 徒 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;By this it will be clear to all men that you are my disciples, if you have love one for another.
<br>13:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;西 门 彼 得 问 耶 稣 说 ， 主 往 哪 里 去 。 耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 我 所 去 的 地 方 ， 你 现 在 不 能 跟 我 去 。 后 来 却 要 跟 我 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Simon Peter said to him, Lord, where are you going? Jesus said in answer, Where I am going you may not come with me now, but you will come later.
<br>13:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 说 ， 主 阿 ， 我 为 什 么 现 在 不 能 跟 你 去 ？ 我 愿 意 为 你 舍 命 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Peter said to him, Why may I not come with you even now? I will give up my life for you.
<br>13:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 你 愿 意 为 我 舍 命 吗 ？ 我 实 实 在 在 地 告 诉 你 ， 鸡 叫 以 先 ， 你 要 三 次 不 认 我 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus said in answer, Will you give up your life for me? Truly I say to you, Before the cry of the cock you will have said three times that you are not my disciple.
