<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;After these things Jesus let himself be seen again by the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and it came about in this way.
<br>21:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 西 门 彼 得 ， 和 称 为 低 土 马 的 多 马 ， 并 加 利 利 的 迦 拿 人 拿 但 业 ， 还 有 西 庇 太 的 两 个 儿 子 ， 又 有 两 个 门 徒 ， 都 在 一 处 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Simon Peter, Thomas named Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were all together.
<br>21:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;西 门 彼 得 对 他 们 说 ， 我 打 鱼 去 。 他 们 说 ， 我 们 也 和 你 同 去 。 他 们 就 出 去 ， 上 了 船 ， 那 一 夜 并 没 有 打 着 什 么 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Simon Peter said to them, I am going fishing. They said to him, And we will come with you. They went out and got into the boat; but that night they took no fish.
<br>21:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;天 将 亮 的 时 候 ， 耶 稣 站 在 岸 上 。 门 徒 却 不 知 道 是 耶 稣 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now very early in the morning Jesus was there by the edge of the sea (though the disciples were not conscious that it was Jesus).
<br>21:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 就 对 他 们 说 ， 小 子 ， 你 们 有 吃 的 没 有 。 他 们 回 答 说 ， 没 有 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So Jesus said to them, Children, have you taken any fish? They made answer, No.
<br>21:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 你 们 把 网 撒 在 船 的 右 边 ， 就 必 得 着 。 他 们 便 撒 下 网 去 ， 竟 拉 不 上 来 了 ， 因 为 鱼 甚 多 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said to them, Let down the net on the right side of the boat and you will get some. So they put it in the water and now they were not able to get it up again because of the great number of fish.
<br>21:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 所 爱 的 那 门 徒 对 彼 得 说 ， 是 主 。 那 时 西 门 彼 得 赤 着 身 子 ， 一 听 见 是 主 ， 就 束 上 一 件 外 衣 ， 跳 在 海 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So the disciple who was dear to Jesus said to Peter, It is the Lord! Hearing that it was the Lord, Peter put his coat round him (because he was not clothed) and went into the sea.
<br>21:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;其 余 的 门 徒 （ 离 岸 不 远 ， 约 有 二 百 肘 ， （ 古 时 以 肘 为 尺 ， 一 肘 约 有 今 时 尺 半 ） 就 在 小 船 上 把 那 网 鱼 拉 过 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the other disciples came in the little boat (they were not far from land, only about two hundred cubits off) pulling the net full of fish.
<br>21:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 上 了 岸 ， 就 看 见 那 里 有 炭 火 ， 上 面 有 鱼 ， 又 有 饼 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;When they got to land, they saw a fire of coals there, with fish cooking on it, and bread.
<br>21:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 把 刚 才 打 的 鱼 ， 拿 几 条 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus said to them, Get some of the fish which you have now taken.
<br>21:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;西 门 彼 得 就 去 ， （ 或 作 上 船 ） 把 网 拉 到 岸 上 ， 那 网 满 了 大 鱼 ， 共 一 百 五 十 三 条 。 鱼 虽 这 样 多 ， 网 却 没 有 破 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So Peter went to the boat and came back pulling the net to land, full of great fish, a hundred and fifty-three; and though there was such a number the net was not broken.
<br>21:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 你 们 来 吃 早 饭 。 门 徒 中 没 有 一 个 敢 问 他 ， 你 是 谁 ？ 因 为 知 道 是 主 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus said to them, Come and take some food. And all the disciples were in fear of putting the question, Who are you? being conscious that it was the Lord.
<br>21:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 就 来 拿 饼 和 鱼 给 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish in the same way.
<br>21:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 从 死 里 复 活 以 后 ， 向 门 徒 显 现 ， 这 是 第 三 次 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now this was the third time that Jesus let himself be seen by the disciples after he had come back from the dead.
<br>21:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 吃 完 了 早 饭 ， 耶 稣 对 西 门 彼 得 说 ， 约 翰 的 儿 子 西 门 ， （ 约 翰 马 太 十 六 章 十 七 节 称 约 拿 ） 你 爱 我 比 这 些 更 深 吗 ？ 彼 得 说 ， 主 阿 ， 是 的 。 你 知 道 我 爱 你 。 耶 稣 对 他 说 ， 你 喂 养 我 的 小 羊 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then when they had taken food, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, is your love for me greater than the love of these others? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you are certain of my love for you. He said to him, Then give my lambs food.
<br>21:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 第 二 次 又 对 他 说 ， 约 翰 的 儿 子 西 门 ， 你 爱 我 吗 ？ 彼 得 说 ， 主 阿 ， 是 的 。 你 知 道 我 爱 你 。 耶 稣 说 ， 你 牧 养 我 的 羊 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Again, a second time, he said to him, Simon, son of John, have you any love for me? Yes, Lord, he said, you are certain of my love for you. Then take care of my sheep, said Jesus.
<br>21:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;第 三 次 对 他 说 ， 约 翰 的 儿 子 西 门 ， 你 爱 我 吗 ？ 彼 得 因 为 耶 稣 第 三 次 对 他 说 ， 你 爱 我 吗 ？ 就 忧 愁 ， 对 耶 稣 说 ， 主 阿 ， 你 是 无 所 不 知 的 ， 你 知 道 我 爱 你 。 耶 稣 说 ， 你 喂 养 我 的 羊 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He said to him a third time, Simon, son of John, am I dear to you? Now Peter was troubled in his heart because he put the question a third time, Am I dear to you? And he said to him, Lord, you have knowledge of all things; you see that you are dear to me. Jesus said to him, Then give my sheep food.
<br>21:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 实 实 在 在 地 告 诉 你 ， 你 年 少 的 时 候 ， 自 己 束 上 带 子 ， 随 意 往 来 ， 但 年 老 的 时 候 ， 你 要 伸 出 手 来 ， 别 人 要 把 你 束 上 ， 带 你 到 不 愿 意 去 的 地 方 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Truly I say to you, When you were young, you made yourself ready and went wherever you had a desire to go: but when you are old, you will put out your hands and another will make you ready, and you will be taken where you have no desire to go.
<br>21:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 这 话 ， 是 指 着 彼 得 要 怎 样 死 荣 耀 神 。 说 了 这 话 ， 就 对 他 说 ， 你 跟 从 我 吧 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now this he said, pointing out the sort of death by which he would give God glory. And after saying this, he said to him, Come after me.
<br>21:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 转 过 来 ， 看 见 耶 稣 所 爱 的 那 门 徒 跟 着 ， 就 是 在 晚 饭 的 时 候 ， 靠 着 耶 稣 胸 膛 ， 说 ， 主 阿 ， 卖 你 的 是 谁 ？ 的 那 门 徒 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Peter, turning round, saw the disciple who was dear to Jesus coming after them--the disciple who was resting on his breast at the last meal, and said, Lord, who is it who will be false to you?
<br>21:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 看 见 他 ， 就 问 耶 稣 说 ， 主 阿 ， 这 人 将 来 如 何 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, What about this man?
<br>21:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 说 ， 我 若 要 他 等 到 我 来 的 时 候 ， 与 你 何 干 ？ 你 跟 从 我 吧 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus said to him, If it is my desire for him to be here till I come back, what is that to you? come yourself after me.
<br>21:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 这 话 传 在 弟 兄 中 间 ， 说 那 门 徒 不 死 。 其 实 耶 稣 不 是 说 他 不 死 。 乃 是 说 我 若 要 他 等 到 我 来 的 时 候 ， 与 你 何 干 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So this saying went about among the brothers that this disciple would not undergo death: Jesus, however, did not say that he would not undergo death, but, If it is my desire for him to be here till I come back, what is that to you?
<br>21:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;为 这 些 事 作 见 证 ， 并 且 记 载 这 些 事 的 ， 就 是 这 门 徒 。 我 们 也 知 道 他 的 见 证 是 真 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;This is the disciple who gives witness about these things and who put them in writing: and we have knowledge that his witness is true.
<br>21:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 所 行 的 事 ， 还 有 许 多 ， 若 是 一 一 的 都 写 出 来 ， 我 想 所 写 的 书 ， 就 是 世 界 也 容 不 下 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus did such a number of other things that, if every one was recorded, it is my opinion that even the world itself is not great enough for the books there would be.
