<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;When Jesus had said these words he went out with his disciples over the stream Kedron to a garden, into which he went with his disciples.
<br>18:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;卖 耶 稣 的 犹 大 也 知 道 那 地 方 。 因 为 耶 稣 和 门 徒 屡 次 上 那 里 去 聚 集 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Judas, who was false to him, had knowledge of the place because Jesus went there frequently with his disciples.
<br>18:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;犹 大 领 了 一 队 兵 ， 和 祭 司 长 并 法 利 赛 人 的 差 役 ， 拿 着 灯 笼 ， 火 把 ， 兵 器 ， 就 来 到 园 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So Judas, getting a band of armed men and police from the chief priests and Pharisees, went there with lights and with arms.
<br>18:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 知 道 将 要 临 到 自 己 的 一 切 事 ， 就 出 来 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 找 谁 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Jesus, having knowledge of everything which was coming on him, went forward and said to them, Who are you looking for?
<br>18:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 回 答 说 ， 找 拿 撒 勒 人 耶 稣 。 耶 稣 说 ， 我 就 是 。 卖 他 的 犹 大 也 同 他 们 站 在 那 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Their answer was, Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus said, I am he. And Judas, who was false to him, was there at their side.
<br>18:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 一 说 我 就 是 ， 他 们 就 退 后 倒 在 地 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he said to them, I am he, they went back, falling to the earth.
<br>18:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 又 问 他 们 说 ， 你 们 找 谁 ？ 他 们 说 ， 找 拿 撒 勒 人 耶 稣 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So again he put the question to them, Who are you looking for? And they said, Jesus the Nazarene.
<br>18:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 我 已 经 告 诉 你 们 ， 我 就 是 。 你 们 若 找 我 ， 就 让 这 些 人 去 吧 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus made answer, I have said that I am he; if you are looking for me, let these men go away.
<br>18:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 要 应 验 耶 稣 从 前 的 话 ， 说 ， 你 所 赐 给 我 的 人 ， 我 没 有 失 落 一 个 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;(He said this so that his words might come true, I have kept safe all those whom you gave to me.)
<br>18:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;西 门 彼 得 带 着 一 把 刀 ， 就 拔 出 来 ， 将 大 祭 司 的 仆 人 砍 了 一 刀 ， 削 掉 他 的 右 耳 。 那 仆 人 名 叫 马 勒 古 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, took it out and gave the high priest's servant a blow, cutting off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.
<br>18:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 就 对 彼 得 说 ， 收 刀 入 鞘 吧 。 我 父 所 给 我 的 那 杯 ， 我 岂 可 不 喝 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Jesus said to Peter, Put back your sword: am I not to take the cup which my Father has given to me?
<br>18:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 队 兵 和 千 夫 长 并 犹 太 人 的 差 役 ， 就 拿 住 耶 稣 ， 把 他 捆 绑 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then the band and the chief captain and the police took Jesus and put cords round him.
<br>18:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;先 带 到 亚 那 面 前 。 因 为 亚 那 是 本 年 作 大 祭 司 该 亚 法 的 岳 父 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;They took him first to Annas, because Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was the high priest that year.
<br>18:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 该 亚 法 ， 就 是 从 前 向 犹 太 人 发 议 论 说 ， 一 个 人 替 百 姓 死 是 有 益 的 那 位 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;It was Caiaphas who had said to the Jews that it was in their interest for one man to be put to death for the people.
<br>18:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;西 门 彼 得 跟 着 耶 稣 ， 还 有 一 个 门 徒 跟 着 。 那 门 徒 是 大 祭 司 所 认 识 的 。 他 就 同 耶 稣 进 了 大 祭 司 的 院 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Simon Peter went after Jesus with another disciple. Now that disciple was a friend of the high priest and he went in with Jesus into the house of the high priest;
<br>18:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 却 站 在 门 外 。 大 祭 司 所 认 识 的 那 个 门 徒 出 来 ， 和 看 门 的 使 女 说 了 一 声 ， 就 领 彼 得 进 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Peter was kept outside at the door. Then this other disciple, who was a friend of the high priest, came out and had a word with the girl who kept the door, and took Peter in.
<br>18:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 看 门 的 使 女 对 彼 得 说 ， 你 不 也 是 这 人 的 门 徒 吗 ？ 他 说 ， 我 不 是 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then the girl who was the door-keeper said to Peter, Are you not one of this man's disciples? In answer he said, I am not.
<br>18:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;仆 人 和 差 役 ， 因 为 天 冷 ， 就 生 了 炭 火 ， 站 在 那 里 烤 火 。 彼 得 也 同 他 们 站 着 烤 火 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now the servants and the police had made a fire of coals because it was cold; they were warming themselves in front of it and Peter was there with them, warming himself.
<br>18:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;大 祭 司 就 以 耶 稣 的 门 徒 和 他 的 教 训 盘 问 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then the high priest put questions to Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.
<br>18:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 我 从 来 是 明 明 地 对 世 人 说 话 。 我 常 在 会 堂 和 殿 里 ， 就 是 犹 太 人 聚 集 的 地 方 ， 教 训 人 。 我 在 暗 地 里 ， 并 没 有 说 什 么 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus made answer, I said things openly to the world at all times; I have given my teaching in the Synagogues and in the Temple to which all the Jews come; and I have said nothing secretly.
<br>18:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 为 什 么 问 我 呢 ？ 可 以 问 那 听 见 的 人 ， 我 对 他 们 说 的 是 什 么 。 我 所 说 的 ， 他 们 都 知 道 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Why are you questioning me? put questions to my hearers about what I have said to them: they have knowledge of what I said.
<br>18:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 了 这 话 ， 旁 边 站 着 的 一 个 差 役 ， 用 手 掌 打 他 说 ， 你 这 样 回 答 大 祭 司 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;When he said this, one of the police by his side gave him a blow with his open hand, saying, Do you give such an answer to the high priest?
<br>18:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 我 若 说 的 不 是 ， 你 可 以 指 证 那 不 是 。 我 若 说 的 是 ， 你 为 什 么 打 我 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus said in answer, If I have said anything evil, give witness to the evil: but if I said what is true, why do you give me blows?
<br>18:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;亚 那 就 把 耶 稣 解 到 大 祭 司 该 亚 法 那 里 ， 仍 是 捆 着 解 去 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Annas sent him chained to Caiaphas, the high priest.
<br>18:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;西 门 彼 得 正 站 着 烤 火 ， 有 人 对 他 说 ， 你 不 也 是 他 的 门 徒 吗 ？ 彼 得 不 承 认 ， 说 ， 我 不 是 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Simon Peter was still there warming himself by the fire. They said to him, Are you not one of his disciples? He said, No, I am not.
<br>18:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 大 祭 司 的 一 个 仆 人 ， 是 彼 得 削 掉 耳 朵 那 人 的 亲 属 ， 说 ， 我 不 是 看 见 你 同 他 在 园 子 里 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;One of the servants of the high priest, a relation of him whose ear had been cut off by Peter, said, Did I not see you with him in the garden?
<br>18:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 得 又 不 承 认 。 立 时 鸡 就 叫 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then again Peter said, No. And straight away a cock gave its cry.
<br>18:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 将 耶 稣 从 该 亚 法 那 里 往 衙 门 内 解 去 。 那 时 天 还 早 。 他 们 自 己 却 不 进 衙 门 ， 恐 怕 染 了 污 秽 ， 不 能 吃 逾 越 节 的 筵 席 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So they took Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the Praetorium. It was early. They themselves did not go into the Praetorium, so that they might not become unclean, but might take the Passover.
<br>18:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 就 出 来 ， 到 他 们 那 里 ， 说 ， 你 们 告 这 人 是 为 什 么 事 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So Pilate came out to them and put the question: What have you to say against this man?
<br>18:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 回 答 说 ， 这 人 若 不 是 作 恶 的 ， 我 们 就 不 把 他 交 给 你 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;They said to him in answer, If the man was not a wrongdoer we would not have given him up to you.
<br>18:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 说 ， 你 们 自 己 带 他 去 ， 按 着 你 们 的 律 法 审 问 他 吧 。 犹 太 人 说 ， 我 们 没 有 杀 人 的 权 柄 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves and let him be judged by your law. But the Jews said to him, We have no right to put any man to death.
<br>18:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 要 应 验 耶 稣 所 说 ， 自 己 将 要 怎 样 死 的 话 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;(That the word of Jesus might come true, pointing to the sort of death he would have.)
<br>18:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 又 进 了 衙 门 ， 叫 耶 稣 来 ， 对 他 说 ， 你 是 犹 太 人 的 王 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Pilate went back into the Praetorium and sent for Jesus and said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?
<br>18:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 这 话 是 你 自 己 说 的 ， 还 是 别 人 论 我 对 你 说 的 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus made answer, Do you say this of yourself, or did others say it about me?
<br>18:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 说 ， 我 岂 是 犹 太 人 呢 ？ 你 本 国 的 人 和 祭 司 长 ， 把 你 交 给 我 。 你 作 了 什 么 事 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Pilate said, Am I a Jew? Your nation and the chief priests have given you into my hands: what have you done?
<br>18:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 我 的 国 不 属 这 世 界 。 我 的 国 若 属 这 世 界 ， 我 的 臣 仆 必 要 争 战 ， 使 我 不 至 于 被 交 给 犹 太 人 。 只 是 我 的 国 不 属 这 世 界 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus said in answer, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom was of this world, my disciples would have made a good fight to keep me out of the hands of the Jews: but my kingdom is not here.
<br>18:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 就 对 他 说 ， 这 样 ， 你 是 王 吗 ？ 耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 你 说 我 是 王 。 我 为 此 而 生 ， 也 为 此 来 到 世 间 ， 特 为 给 真 理 作 见 证 。 凡 属 真 理 的 人 ， 就 听 我 的 话 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Pilate said to him, Are you then a king? Jesus made answer, You say that I am a king. For this purpose was I given birth, and for this purpose I came into the world, that I might give witness to what is true. Every lover of what is true gives ear to my voice.
<br>18:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 说 ， 真 理 是 什 么 呢 ？ 说 了 这 话 ， 又 出 来 到 犹 太 人 那 里 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 我 查 不 出 他 有 什 么 罪 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Pilate said to him, True? what is true? Having said this he went out again to the Jews and said to them, I see no wrong in him.
<br>18:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 你 们 有 个 规 矩 ， 在 逾 越 节 要 我 给 你 们 释 放 一 个 人 ， 你 们 要 我 给 你 们 释 放 犹 太 人 的 王 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But every year you make a request to me to let a prisoner go free at the Passover. Is it your desire that I let the King of the Jews go free?
<br>18:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 又 喊 着 说 ， 不 要 这 人 ， 要 巴 拉 巴 。 这 巴 拉 巴 是 个 强 盗 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then again they gave a loud cry, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was an outlaw.
