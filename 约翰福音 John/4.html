<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now when it was clear to the Lord that word had come to the ears of the Pharisees that Jesus was making more disciples than John and was giving them baptism
<br>4:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;（ 其 实 不 是 耶 稣 亲 自 施 洗 ， 乃 是 他 的 门 徒 施 洗 ）
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;(Though, in fact, it was his disciples who gave baptism, not Jesus himself),
<br>4:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 就 离 了 犹 太 ， 又 往 加 利 利 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He went out of Judaea into Galilee again.
<br>4:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;必 须 经 过 撒 玛 利 亚 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he must needs go through Samaria.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And it was necessary for him to go through Samaria.
<br>4:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 到 了 撒 玛 利 亚 的 一 座 城 ， 名 叫 叙 加 ， 靠 近 雅 各 给 他 儿 子 约 瑟 的 那 块 地 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So he came to a town of Samaria which was named Sychar, near to the bit of land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph:
<br>4:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 那 里 有 雅 各 井 。 耶 稣 因 走 路 困 乏 ， 就 坐 在 井 旁 。 那 时 约 有 午 正 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now Jacob's fountain was there. Jesus, being tired after his journey, was resting by the fountain. It was about the sixth hour.
<br>4:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 一 个 撒 玛 利 亚 的 妇 人 来 打 水 。 耶 稣 对 她 说 ， 请 你 给 我 水 喝 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;A woman of Samaria came to get water, and Jesus said to her, Give me some water.
<br>4:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 时 门 徒 进 城 买 食 物 去 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For his disciples had gone to the town to get food.
<br>4:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;撒 玛 利 亚 的 妇 人 对 他 说 ， 你 既 是 犹 太 人 ， 怎 么 向 我 一 个 撒 玛 利 亚 妇 人 要 水 喝 呢 ？ 原 来 犹 太 人 和 撒 玛 利 亚 人 没 有 来 往 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The woman of Samaria said to him, Why do you, a Jew, make a request for water to me, a woman of Samaria? She said this because Jews have nothing to do with the people of Samaria.
<br>4:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 你 若 知 道 神 的 恩 赐 ， 和 对 你 说 给 我 水 喝 的 是 谁 ， 你 必 早 求 他 ， 他 也 必 早 给 了 你 活 水 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;In answer Jesus said, If you had knowledge of what God gives freely and who it is who says to you, Give me water, you would make your prayer to him, and he would give you living water.
<br>4:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;妇 人 说 ， 先 生 没 有 打 水 的 器 具 ， 井 又 深 ， 你 从 哪 里 得 活 水 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The woman said to him, Sir, you have no vessel and the fountain is deep; from where will you get the living water?
<br>4:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 们 的 祖 宗 雅 各 ， 将 这 井 留 给 我 们 。 他 自 己 和 儿 子 并 牲 畜 ， 也 都 喝 这 井 里 的 水 ， 难 道 你 比 他 还 大 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Are you greater than our father Jacob who gave us the fountain and took the water of it himself, with his children and his cattle?
<br>4:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 凡 喝 这 水 的 ， 还 要 再 渴 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus said to her, Everyone who takes this water will be in need of it again:
<br>4:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;人 若 喝 我 所 赐 的 水 就 永 远 不 渴 。 我 所 赐 的 水 ， 要 在 他 里 头 成 为 泉 源 ， 直 涌 到 永 生 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But whoever takes the water I give him will never be in need of drink again; for the water I give him will become in him a fountain of eternal life.
<br>4:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;妇 人 说 ， 先 生 ， 请 把 这 水 赐 给 我 ， 叫 我 不 渴 ， 也 不 用 来 这 么 远 打 水 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The woman said to him, Sir, give me this water, so that I may not be in need again of drink and will not have to come all this way for it.
<br>4:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 你 去 叫 你 丈 夫 也 到 这 里 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus said to her, Go, get your husband and come back here with him.
<br>4:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;妇 人 说 ， 我 没 有 丈 夫 。 耶 稣 说 ， 你 说 没 有 丈 夫 ， 是 不 错 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;In answer, the woman said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, You have said rightly, I have no husband:
<br>4:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 已 经 有 五 个 丈 夫 。 你 现 在 有 的 ， 并 不 是 你 的 丈 夫 。 你 这 话 是 真 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;You have had five husbands, and the man you have now is not your husband: that was truly said.
<br>4:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;妇 人 说 ， 先 生 ， 我 看 出 你 是 先 知 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The woman said to him, Sir, I see that you are a prophet.
<br>4:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 们 的 祖 宗 在 这 山 上 礼 拜 。 你 们 倒 说 ， 应 当 礼 拜 的 地 方 是 在 耶 路 撒 冷 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Our fathers gave worship on this mountain, but you Jews say that the right place for worship is in Jerusalem.
<br>4:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 妇 人 ， 你 当 信 我 ， 时 候 将 到 ， 你 们 拜 父 ， 也 不 在 这 山 上 ， 也 不 在 耶 路 撒 冷 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus said to her, Woman, take my word for this; the time is coming when you will not give worship to the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem.
<br>4:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 所 拜 的 ， 你 们 不 知 道 。 我 们 所 拜 的 ， 我 们 知 道 。 因 为 救 恩 是 从 犹 太 人 出 来 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;You give worship, but without knowledge of what you are worshipping: we give worship to what we have knowledge of: for salvation comes from the Jews.
<br>4:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;时 候 将 到 ， 如 今 就 是 了 ， 那 真 正 拜 父 的 ， 要 用 心 灵 和 诚 实 拜 他 ， 因 为 父 要 这 样 的 人 拜 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But the time is coming, and is even now here, when the true worshippers will give worship to the Father in the true way of the spirit, for these are the worshippers desired by the Father.
<br>4:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;神 是 个 灵 （ 或 无 个 字 ） 所 以 拜 他 的 ， 必 须 用 心 灵 和 诚 实 拜 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;God is Spirit: then let his worshippers give him worship in the true way of the spirit.
<br>4:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;妇 人 说 ， 我 知 道 弥 赛 亚 ， （ 就 是 那 称 为 基 督 的 ） 要 来 。 他 来 了 ， 必 将 一 切 的 事 都 告 诉 我 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The woman said to him, I am certain that the Messiah, who is named Christ, is coming; when he comes he will make all things clear to us.
<br>4:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 这 和 你 说 话 的 就 是 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus said to her, I, who am talking to you, am he.
<br>4:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;当 下 门 徒 回 来 ， 就 希 奇 耶 稣 和 一 个 妇 人 说 话 。 只 是 没 有 人 说 ， 你 是 要 什 么 ？ 或 说 ， 你 为 什 么 和 她 说 话 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;At that point the disciples came back, and they were surprised to see him talking to a woman; but not one of them said to him, What is your purpose? or, Why are you talking to her?
<br>4:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 妇 人 就 留 下 水 罐 子 ， 往 城 里 去 ， 对 众 人 说 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then the woman put down her water-pot and went into the town, and said to the people,
<br>4:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 来 看 ， 有 一 个 人 将 我 素 来 所 行 的 一 切 事 ， 都 给 我 说 出 来 了 ， 莫 非 这 就 是 基 督 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Come and see a man who has been talking to me of everything I ever did! Is it possible that this is the Christ?
<br>4:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 就 出 城 往 耶 稣 那 里 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So they went out of the town and came to him.
<br>4:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 其 间 ， 门 徒 对 耶 稣 说 ， 拉 比 请 吃 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;While this was taking place, the disciples were saying to Jesus, Master, take some food.
<br>4:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 我 有 食 物 吃 ， 是 你 们 不 知 道 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But he said to them, I have food of which you have no knowledge.
<br>4:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;门 徒 就 彼 此 对 问 说 ， 莫 非 有 人 拿 什 么 给 他 吃 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So the disciples said one to another, Did anyone give him food?
<br>4:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 我 的 食 物 ， 就 是 遵 行 差 我 来 者 的 旨 意 ， 作 成 他 的 工 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus said, My food is to do the pleasure of him who sent me and to make his work complete.
<br>4:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 岂 不 说 ， 到 收 割 的 时 候 ， 还 有 四 个 月 吗 ？ 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 举 目 向 田 观 看 ， 庄 稼 已 经 熟 了 ， （ 原 文 作 发 白 ） 可 以 收 割 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;You would say, Four months from now is the time of the grain-cutting. Take a look, I say to you, at the fields; they are even now white for cutting.
<br>4:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;收 割 的 人 得 工 价 ， 积 蓄 五 谷 到 永 生 。 叫 撒 种 的 和 收 割 的 一 同 快 乐 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He who does the cutting now has his reward; he is getting together fruit for eternal life, so that he who did the planting and he who gets in the grain may have joy together.
<br>4:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;俗 语 说 ， 那 人 撒 种 ， 这 人 收 割 ， 这 话 可 见 是 真 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;In this the saying is a true one, One does the planting, and another gets in the grain.
<br>4:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 差 你 们 去 收 你 们 所 没 有 劳 苦 的 。 别 人 劳 苦 ， 你 们 享 受 他 们 所 劳 苦 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;I sent you to get in grain which you had no hand in planting: other men did that work, and you take the reward.
<br>4:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 城 里 有 好 些 撒 玛 利 亚 人 信 了 耶 稣 ， 因 为 那 妇 人 作 见 证 说 ， 他 将 我 素 来 所 行 的 一 切 事 ， 都 给 我 说 出 来 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now a number of the people of that town had faith in him because of the woman's witness: He has been talking to me of everything I ever did.
<br>4:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 撒 玛 利 亚 人 来 见 耶 稣 ， 求 他 在 他 们 那 里 住 下 。 他 便 在 那 里 住 了 两 天 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So when the people came to him they made request to him to be among them for a time, and he was there two days.
<br>4:41&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 耶 稣 的 话 ， 信 的 人 就 更 多 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And many more believed because of his own word;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And a great number more of them came to have faith in him because of what he himself said.
<br>4:42&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;便 对 妇 人 说 ， 现 在 我 们 信 ， 不 是 因 为 你 的 话 ， 是 我 们 亲 自 听 见 了 ， 知 道 这 真 是 救 世 主 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they said to the woman, Now we have faith, but not because of your story: we ourselves have given ear to his words, and we are certain that he is truly the Saviour of the world.
<br>4:43&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;过 了 那 两 天 ， 耶 稣 离 了 那 地 方 ， 往 加 利 利 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And after the two days he went on from there into Galilee.
<br>4:44&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 耶 稣 自 己 作 过 见 证 说 ， 先 知 在 本 地 是 没 有 人 尊 敬 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For Jesus himself said that a prophet has no honour in the country of his birth.
<br>4:45&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;到 了 加 利 利 ， 加 利 利 人 既 然 看 见 他 在 耶 路 撒 冷 过 节 所 行 的 一 切 事 ， 就 接 待 他 。 因 为 他 们 也 是 上 去 过 节 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans took him to their hearts because of the things which they had seen him do in Jerusalem at the feast--they themselves having been there at the feast.
<br>4:46&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 又 到 了 加 利 利 的 迦 拿 ， 就 是 他 从 前 变 水 为 酒 的 地 方 。 有 一 个 大 臣 ， 他 的 儿 子 在 迦 百 农 患 病 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So he came to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain man of high position whose son was ill at Capernaum.
<br>4:47&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 听 见 耶 稣 从 犹 太 到 了 加 利 利 ， 就 来 见 他 ， 求 他 下 去 医 治 他 的 儿 子 。 因 为 他 儿 子 快 要 死 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;When it came to his ears that Jesus had come from Judaea into Galilee, he went to him and made a request that he would come down to his son, who was near to death, and make him well.
<br>4:48&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 就 对 他 说 ， 若 不 看 见 神 迹 奇 事 ， 你 们 总 是 不 信 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Jesus said to him, You will not have faith if you do not see signs and wonders.
<br>4:49&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 大 臣 说 ， 先 生 ， 求 你 趁 着 我 的 孩 子 还 没 有 死 ， 就 下 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The man said, Sir, come down before my boy is dead.
<br>4:50&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 说 ， 回 去 吧 。 你 的 儿 子 活 了 。 那 人 信 耶 稣 所 说 的 话 ， 就 回 去 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus said, Go in peace; your son is living. The man had faith in the word which Jesus said to him and went away.
<br>4:51&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;正 下 去 的 时 候 ， 他 的 仆 人 迎 见 他 ， 说 ， 他 的 儿 子 活 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And while he was going down, his servants came to him and said, Your boy is living.
<br>4:52&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 就 问 什 么 时 候 见 好 的 。 他 们 说 ， 昨 日 未 时 热 就 退 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So he put a question to them as to the hour when he became better; and they said to him, The disease went from him yesterday at the seventh hour.
<br>4:53&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 便 知 道 这 正 是 耶 稣 对 他 说 ， 你 儿 子 活 了 的 时 候 ， 他 自 己 和 全 家 就 都 信 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;It was clear then to the father that this was the very time at which Jesus said to him, Your son is living. And he had faith in Jesus, he and all his family.
<br>4:54&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 是 耶 稣 在 加 利 利 行 的 第 二 件 神 迹 ， 是 他 从 犹 太 回 去 以 后 行 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now this is the second sign which Jesus did after he had come out of Judaea into Galilee.
