<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Pilate took Jesus and had him whipped with cords.
<br>19:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;兵 丁 用 荆 棘 编 作 冠 冕 ， 戴 在 他 头 上 ， 给 他 穿 上 紫 袍 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the men of the army made a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they put a purple robe on him.
<br>19:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 挨 近 他 说 ， 恭 喜 犹 太 人 的 王 阿 。 他 们 就 用 手 掌 打 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they kept coming and saying, Long life to the King of the Jews! And they gave him blows with their hands.
<br>19:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 又 出 来 对 众 人 说 ， 我 带 他 出 来 见 你 们 ， 叫 你 们 知 道 我 查 不 出 他 有 什 么 罪 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Pilate went out again and said to them, See, I let him come out to you to make it clear to you that I see no wrong in him.
<br>19:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 出 来 ， 戴 着 荆 棘 冠 冕 ， 穿 着 紫 袍 。 彼 拉 多 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 看 这 个 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Jesus came out with the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, Here is the man!
<br>19:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;祭 司 长 和 差 役 看 见 他 ， 就 喊 着 说 ， 钉 他 十 字 架 ， 钉 他 十 字 架 。 彼 拉 多 说 ， 你 们 自 己 把 他 钉 十 字 架 吧 。 我 查 不 出 他 有 什 么 罪 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So when the chief priests and the police saw him they gave a loud cry, To the cross! to the cross! Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves and put him on the cross: I see no crime in him.
<br>19:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;犹 太 人 回 答 说 ， 我 们 有 律 法 ， 按 那 律 法 ， 他 是 该 死 的 ， 因 他 以 自 己 为 神 的 儿 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the Jews made answer, We have a law, and by that law it is right for him to be put to death because he said he was the Son of God.
<br>19:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 听 见 这 话 ， 越 发 害 怕 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;When this saying came to Pilate's ears his fear became greater;
<br>19:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 进 衙 门 ， 对 耶 稣 说 ， 你 是 哪 里 来 的 ？ 耶 稣 却 不 回 答 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he went again into the Praetorium and said to Jesus, Where do you come from? But Jesus gave him no answer.
<br>19:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 说 ， 你 不 对 我 说 话 吗 ？ 你 岂 不 知 我 有 权 柄 释 放 你 ， 也 有 权 柄 把 你 钉 十 字 架 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Pilate said to him, You say nothing to me? is it not clear to you that I have power to let you go free and power to put you to death on the cross?
<br>19:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 若 不 是 从 上 头 赐 给 你 的 ， 你 就 毫 无 权 柄 办 我 。 所 以 把 我 交 给 你 的 那 人 ， 罪 更 重 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus gave this answer: You would have no power at all over me if it was not given to you by God; so that he who gave me up to you has the greater sin.
<br>19:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;从 此 彼 拉 多 想 要 释 放 耶 稣 。 无 奈 犹 太 人 喊 着 说 ， 你 若 释 放 这 个 人 ， 就 不 是 该 撒 的 忠 臣 。 （ 原 文 作 朋 友 ） 凡 以 自 己 为 王 的 ， 就 是 背 叛 该 撒 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Hearing this, Pilate had a desire to let him go free, but the Jews said in a loud voice, If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend: everyone who makes himself a king goes against Caesar.
<br>19:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 听 见 这 话 ， 就 带 耶 稣 出 来 ， 到 了 一 个 地 方 ， 名 叫 铺 华 石 处 ， 希 伯 来 话 叫 厄 巴 大 ， 就 在 那 里 坐 堂 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So when these words came to Pilate's ear, he took Jesus out, seating himself in the judge's seat in a place named in Hebrew, Gabbatha, or the Stone Floor.
<br>19:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 日 是 预 备 逾 越 节 的 日 子 ， 约 有 午 正 。 彼 拉 多 对 犹 太 人 说 ， 看 哪 ， 这 是 你 们 的 王 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;(It was the day when they made ready for the Passover; and it was about the sixth hour.) And he said to the Jews, There is your King!
<br>19:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 喊 着 说 ， 除 掉 他 ， 除 掉 他 ， 钉 他 在 十 字 架 上 。 彼 拉 多 说 ， 我 可 以 把 你 们 的 王 钉 十 字 架 吗 ？ 祭 司 长 回 答 说 ， 除 了 该 撒 ， 我 们 没 有 王 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then they gave a loud cry, Away with him! away with him! to the cross! Pilate said to them, Am I to put your King to death on the cross? The chief priests said in answer, We have no king but Caesar.
<br>19:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 彼 拉 多 将 耶 稣 交 给 他 们 去 钉 十 字 架 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So then he gave him up to them to be put to death on the cross. And they took Jesus away;
<br>19:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 就 把 耶 稣 带 了 去 。 耶 稣 背 着 自 己 的 十 字 架 出 来 ， 到 了 一 个 地 方 ， 名 叫 髑 髅 地 ， 希 伯 来 话 叫 各 各 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he went out with his cross on him to the place which is named Dead Man's Head (in Hebrew, Golgotha):
<br>19:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 就 在 那 里 钉 他 在 十 字 架 上 ， 还 有 两 个 人 和 他 一 同 钉 着 ， 一 边 一 个 ， 耶 稣 在 中 间 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Where they put him on the cross with two others, one on this side and one on that, and Jesus in the middle.
<br>19:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 又 用 牌 子 写 了 一 个 名 号 ， 安 在 十 字 架 上 。 写 的 是 犹 太 人 的 王 ， 拿 撒 勒 人 耶 稣 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Pilate put on the cross a statement in writing. The writing was: JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
<br>19:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 许 多 犹 太 人 念 这 名 号 。 因 为 耶 稣 被 钉 十 字 架 的 地 方 ， 与 城 相 近 ， 并 且 是 用 希 伯 来 ， 罗 马 ， 希 利 尼 ， 三 样 文 字 写 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The writing was seen by a number of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was put to death on the cross was near the town; and the writing was in Hebrew and Latin and Greek.
<br>19:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;犹 太 人 的 祭 司 长 ， 就 对 彼 拉 多 说 ， 不 要 写 犹 太 人 的 王 。 要 写 他 自 己 说 我 是 犹 太 人 的 王 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Do not put, The King of the Jews, but, He said, I am the King of the Jews.
<br>19:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;彼 拉 多 说 ， 我 所 写 的 ， 我 已 经 写 上 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Pilate made answer, What I have put in writing will not be changed.
<br>19:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;兵 丁 既 然 将 耶 稣 钉 在 十 字 架 上 ， 就 拿 他 的 衣 服 分 为 四 分 ， 每 兵 一 分 。 又 拿 他 的 里 衣 。 这 件 里 衣 ， 原 来 没 有 缝 儿 ， 是 上 下 一 片 织 成 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when Jesus was nailed to the cross, the men of the army took his clothing, and made a division of it into four parts, to every man a part, and they took his coat: now the coat was without a join, made out of one bit of cloth.
<br>19:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 就 彼 此 说 ， 我 们 不 要 撕 开 ， 只 要 拈 阄 ， 看 谁 得 着 。 这 要 应 验 经 上 的 话 说 ， 他 们 分 了 我 的 外 衣 ， 为 我 的 里 衣 拈 阄 。 兵 丁 果 然 作 了 这 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So they said among themselves, Let this not be cut up, but let us put it to the decision of chance and see who gets it. (They did this so that the Writings might come true, which say, They made a distribution of my clothing among them, and my coat they put to the decision of chance.) This was what the men of the army did.
<br>19:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;站 在 耶 稣 十 字 架 旁 边 的 ， 有 他 母 亲 ， 与 他 母 亲 的 姊 妹 ， 并 革 罗 吧 的 妻 子 马 利 亚 ， 和 抹 大 拉 的 马 利 亚 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now by the side of the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother's sister Mary, the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene.
<br>19:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 见 母 亲 和 他 所 爱 的 那 门 徒 站 在 旁 边 ， 就 对 他 母 亲 说 ， 母 亲 （ 原 文 作 妇 人 ） ， 看 你 的 儿 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple who was dear to him, he said to his mother, Mother, there is your son!
<br>19:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 对 那 门 徒 说 ， 看 你 的 母 亲 。 从 此 那 门 徒 就 接 她 到 自 己 家 里 去 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then he said to the disciple, There is your mother! And from that hour the disciple took her to his house.
<br>19:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 事 以 后 ， 耶 稣 知 道 各 样 的 事 已 经 成 了 ， 为 要 使 经 上 的 话 应 验 ， 就 说 ， 我 渴 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;After this, being conscious that all things had now been done so that the Writings might come true, Jesus said, Give me water.
<br>19:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 一 个 器 皿 盛 满 了 醋 ， 放 在 那 里 。 他 们 就 拿 海 绒 蘸 满 了 醋 ， 绑 在 牛 膝 草 上 ， 送 到 他 口 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now there was a vessel ready, full of bitter wine, and they put a sponge full of it on a stick and put it to his mouth.
<br>19:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 尝 （ 原 文 作 受 ） 了 那 醋 ， 就 说 ， 成 了 。 便 低 下 头 ， 将 灵 魂 交 付 神 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So when Jesus had taken the wine he said, All is done. And with his head bent he gave up his spirit.
<br>19:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;犹 太 人 因 这 日 是 预 备 日 ， 又 因 那 安 息 日 是 个 大 日 ， 就 求 彼 拉 多 叫 人 打 断 他 们 的 腿 ， 把 他 们 拿 去 ， 免 得 尸 首 当 安 息 日 留 在 十 字 架 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now it was the day of getting ready for the Passover, and so that the bodies might not be on the cross on the Sabbath (because the day of that Sabbath was a great day), the Jews made a request to Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
<br>19:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 兵 丁 来 ， 把 头 一 个 人 的 腿 ， 并 与 耶 稣 同 钉 第 二 个 人 的 腿 ， 都 打 断 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So the men of the army came, and the legs of the first were broken and then of the other who was put to death on the cross with Jesus:
<br>19:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;只 是 来 到 耶 稣 那 里 ， 见 他 已 经 死 了 ， 就 不 打 断 他 的 腿 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But when they came to Jesus, they saw that he was dead by this time, and so his legs were not broken;
<br>19:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;惟 有 一 个 兵 拿 枪 扎 他 的 肋 旁 ， 随 即 有 血 和 水 流 出 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But one of the men made a wound in his side with a spear, and straight away there came out blood and water.
<br>19:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;看 见 这 事 的 那 人 就 作 见 证 ， 他 的 见 证 也 是 真 的 ， 并 且 他 知 道 自 己 所 说 的 是 真 的 ， 叫 你 们 也 可 以 信 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he who saw it has given witness (and his witness is true; he is certain that what he says is true) so that you may have belief.
<br>19:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 些 事 成 了 ， 为 要 应 验 经 上 的 话 说 ， 他 的 骨 头 ， 一 根 也 不 可 折 断 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;These things came about so that the Writings might be true, No bone of his body will be broken.
<br>19:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;经 上 又 有 一 句 说 ， 他 们 要 仰 望 自 己 所 扎 的 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And again another verse says, They will see him who was wounded by their spears.
<br>19:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 些 事 以 后 ， 有 亚 利 马 太 人 约 瑟 ， 是 耶 稣 的 门 徒 ， 只 因 怕 犹 太 人 ， 就 暗 暗 地 作 门 徒 ， 他 来 求 彼 拉 多 ， 要 把 耶 稣 的 身 体 领 去 。 彼 拉 多 允 准 ， 他 就 把 耶 稣 的 身 体 领 去 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, made a request to Pilate to let him take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate said he might do so. So he went and took away his body.
<br>19:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 有 尼 哥 底 母 ， 就 是 先 前 夜 里 去 见 耶 稣 的 ， 带 着 没 药 ， 和 沉 香 ， 约 有 一 百 斤 前 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Nicodemus came (he who had first come to Jesus by night) with a roll of myrrh and aloes mixed, about a hundred pounds.
<br>19:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 就 照 犹 太 人 殡 葬 的 规 矩 ， 把 耶 稣 的 身 体 ， 用 细 麻 布 加 上 香 料 裹 好 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then they took the body of Jesus, folding linen about it with the spices, as is the way of the Jews when they put the dead to rest.
<br>19:41&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 耶 稣 钉 十 字 架 的 地 方 ， 有 一 个 园 子 。 园 子 里 有 一 座 新 坟 墓 ， 是 从 来 没 有 葬 过 人 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now there was a garden near the cross, and in the garden a new place for the dead in which no man had ever been put.
<br>19:42&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;只 因 是 犹 太 人 的 预 备 日 ， 又 因 那 坟 墓 近 ， 他 们 就 把 耶 稣 安 放 在 那 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So they put Jesus there, because it was the Jews' day of getting ready for the Passover, and the place was near.
