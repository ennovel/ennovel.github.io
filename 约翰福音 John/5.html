<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
<br>5:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 靠 近 羊 门 ， 有 一 个 池 子 ， 希 伯 来 话 叫 作 毕 士 大 ， 旁 边 有 五 个 廊 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now in Jerusalem near the sheep-market there is a public bath which in Hebrew is named Beth-zatha. It has five doorways.
<br>5:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;里 面 躺 着 瞎 眼 的 ， 瘸 腿 的 ， 血 气 枯 干 的 ， 许 多 病 人 。 （ 有 古 卷 在 此 有 等 候 水 动
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;In these doorways there were a great number of people with different diseases: some unable to see, some without the power of walking, some with wasted bodies.
<br>5:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 有 天 使 按 时 下 池 子 搅 动 那 水 ， 水 动 之 后 ， 谁 先 下 去 ， 无 论 害 什 么 病 ， 就 痊 愈 了 ） 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;[]
<br>5:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 那 里 有 一 个 人 ， 病 了 三 十 八 年 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;One man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years.
<br>5:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 看 见 他 躺 着 ， 知 道 他 病 了 许 久 ， 就 问 他 说 ， 你 要 痊 愈 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;When Jesus saw him there on the floor it was clear to him that he had been now a long time in that condition, and so he said to the man, Is it your desire to get well?
<br>5:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;病 人 回 答 说 ， 先 生 ， 水 动 的 时 候 ， 没 有 人 把 我 放 在 池 子 里 。 我 正 去 的 时 候 ， 就 有 别 人 比 我 先 下 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The ill man said in answer, Sir, I have nobody to put me into the bath when the water is moving; and while I am on the way down some other person gets in before me.
<br>5:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 说 ， 起 来 ， 拿 你 的 褥 子 走 吧 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus said to him, Get up, take your bed and go.
<br>5:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 人 立 刻 痊 愈 ， 就 拿 起 褥 子 来 走 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the man became well straight away, and took up his bed and went. Now that day was the Sabbath.
<br>5:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 天 是 安 息 日 ， 所 以 犹 太 人 对 那 医 好 的 人 说 ， 今 天 是 安 息 日 ， 你 拿 褥 子 是 不 可 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So the Jews said to the man who had been made well, It is the Sabbath; and it is against the law for you to take up your bed.
<br>5:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 却 回 答 说 ， 那 使 我 痊 愈 的 ， 对 我 说 ， 拿 你 的 褥 子 走 吧 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He said to them, But he who made me well, said to me, Take up your bed and go.
<br>5:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 问 他 说 ， 对 你 说 拿 褥 子 走 的 ， 是 什 么 人 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then they put to him the question: Who is the man who said to you, Take it up and go?
<br>5:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 医 好 的 人 不 知 道 是 谁 。 因 为 那 里 的 人 多 ， 耶 稣 已 经 躲 开 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now he who had been made well had no knowledge who it was, Jesus having gone away because of the number of people who were in that place.
<br>5:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;后 来 耶 稣 在 殿 里 遇 见 他 ， 对 他 说 ， 你 已 经 痊 愈 了 。 不 要 再 犯 罪 。 恐 怕 你 遭 遇 的 更 加 利 害 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;After a time Jesus came across him in the Temple and said to him, See, you are well and strong; do no more sin for fear a worse thing comes to you.
<br>5:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 人 就 去 告 诉 犹 太 人 ， 使 他 痊 愈 的 是 耶 稣 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The man went away and said to the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
<br>5:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;所 以 犹 太 人 逼 迫 耶 稣 ， 因 为 他 在 安 息 日 作 了 这 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And for this reason the Jews were turned against Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.
<br>5:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 就 对 他 们 说 ， 我 父 作 事 直 到 如 今 ， 我 也 作 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But his answer was: My Father is still working even now, and so I am working.
<br>5:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;所 以 犹 太 人 越 发 想 要 杀 他 。 因 他 不 但 犯 了 安 息 日 ， 并 且 称 神 为 他 的 父 ， 将 自 己 和 神 当 作 平 等 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For this cause the Jews had an even greater desire to put Jesus to death, because not only did he not keep the Sabbath but he said God was his Father, so making himself equal with God.
<br>5:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 我 实 实 在 在 地 告 诉 你 们 ， 子 凭 着 自 己 不 能 作 什 么 ， 惟 有 看 见 父 所 作 的 ， 子 才 能 作 。 父 所 作 的 事 ， 子 也 照 样 作 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So Jesus made answer and said, Truly I say to you, The Son is not able to do anything himself; he is able to do only what he sees the Father doing; whatever the Father does the Son does it in the same way.
<br>5:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;父 爱 子 ， 将 自 己 所 作 的 一 切 事 指 给 他 看 。 还 要 将 比 这 更 大 的 事 指 给 他 看 ， 叫 你 们 希 奇 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For the Father has love for the Son and lets him see everything which he does: and he will let him see greater works than these so that you may be full of wonder.
<br>5:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;父 怎 样 叫 死 人 起 来 ， 使 他 们 活 着 ， 子 也 照 样 随 自 己 的 意 思 使 人 活 着 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;In the same way, as the Father gives life to the dead, even so the Son gives life to those to whom he is pleased to give it.
<br>5:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;父 不 审 判 什 么 人 ， 乃 将 审 判 的 事 全 交 与 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The Father is not the judge of men, but he has given all decisions into the hands of the Son;
<br>5:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;叫 人 都 尊 敬 子 ， 如 同 尊 敬 父 一 样 。 不 尊 敬 子 的 ， 就 是 不 尊 敬 差 子 来 的 父 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So that all men may give honour to the Son even as they give honour to the Father. He who gives no honour to the Son gives no honour to the Father who sent him.
<br>5:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 实 实 在 在 地 告 诉 你 们 ， 那 听 我 话 ， 又 信 差 我 来 者 的 ， 就 有 永 生 ， 不 至 于 定 罪 ， 是 已 经 出 死 入 生 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Truly I say to you, The man whose ears are open to my word and who has faith in him who sent me, has eternal life; he will not be judged, but has come from death into life.
<br>5:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 实 实 在 在 地 告 诉 你 们 ， 时 候 将 到 ， 现 在 就 是 了 ， 死 人 要 听 见 神 儿 子 的 声 音 。 听 见 的 人 就 要 活 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Truly I say to you, The time is coming, it has even now come, when the voice of the Son of God will come to the ears of the dead, and those hearing it will have life.
<br>5:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 父 怎 样 在 自 己 有 生 命 ， 就 赐 给 他 儿 子 也 照 样 在 自 己 有 生 命 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For even as the Father has life in himself, so he has given to the Son to have life in himself.
<br>5:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;并 且 因 为 他 是 人 子 ， 就 赐 给 他 行 审 判 的 权 柄 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he has given him authority to be judge because he is the Son of man.
<br>5:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 不 要 把 这 事 看 作 希 奇 。 时 候 要 到 ， 凡 在 坟 墓 里 的 ， 都 要 听 见 他 的 声 音 ， 就 出 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Do not be surprised at this: for the time is coming when his voice will come to all who are in the place of the dead,
<br>5:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;行 善 的 复 活 得 生 ， 作 恶 的 复 活 定 罪 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they will come out; those who have done good, into the new life; and those who have done evil, to be judged.
<br>5:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 凭 着 自 己 不 能 作 什 么 。 我 怎 么 听 见 ， 就 怎 么 审 判 。 我 的 审 判 也 是 公 平 的 。 因 为 我 不 求 自 己 的 意 思 ， 只 求 那 差 我 来 者 的 意 思 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Of myself I am unable to do anything: as the voice comes to me so I give a decision: and my decision is right because I have no desire to do what is pleasing to myself, but only what is pleasing to him who sent me.
<br>5:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 若 为 自 己 作 见 证 ， 我 的 见 证 就 不 真 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;If I gave witness about myself, my witness would not be true.
<br>5:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;另 有 一 位 给 我 作 见 证 。 我 也 知 道 他 给 我 作 的 见 证 是 真 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;There is another who gives witness about me and I am certain that the witness he gives about me is true.
<br>5:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 曾 差 人 到 约 翰 那 里 ， 他 为 真 理 作 过 见 证 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;You sent to John and he gave true witness.
<br>5:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;其 实 我 所 受 的 见 证 ， 不 是 从 人 来 的 。 然 而 我 说 这 些 话 ， 为 要 叫 你 们 得 救 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But I have no need of a man's witness: I only say these things so that you may have salvation.
<br>5:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;约 翰 是 点 着 的 明 灯 。 你 们 情 愿 暂 时 喜 欢 他 的 光 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He was a burning and shining light, and for a time you were ready to be happy in his light.
<br>5:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 我 有 比 约 翰 更 大 的 见 证 。 因 为 父 交 给 我 要 我 成 就 的 事 ， 就 是 我 所 作 的 事 ， 这 便 见 证 我 是 父 所 差 来 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But the witness which I have is greater than that of John: the work which the Father has given me to do, the very work which I am now doing, is a witness that the Father has sent me.
<br>5:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;差 我 来 的 父 ， 也 为 我 作 过 见 证 。 你 们 从 来 没 有 听 见 他 的 声 音 ， 也 没 有 看 见 他 的 形 像 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the Father himself who sent me has given witness about me. Not one of you has ever given ear to his voice; his form you have not seen.
<br>5:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 并 没 有 他 的 道 存 在 心 里 。 因 为 他 所 差 来 的 ， 你 们 不 信 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And you have not kept his word in your hearts, because you have not faith in him whom he has sent.
<br>5:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 查 考 圣 经 。 （ 或 作 应 当 查 考 圣 经 ） 因 你 们 以 为 内 中 有 永 生 。 给 我 作 见 证 的 就 是 这 经 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;You make search in the holy Writings, in the belief that through them you get eternal life; and it is those Writings which give witness about me.
<br>5:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;然 而 你 们 不 肯 到 我 这 里 来 得 生 命 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And still you have no desire to come to me so that you may have life.
<br>5:41&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 不 受 从 人 来 的 荣 耀 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;I receive not honour from men.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;I do not take honour from men;
<br>5:42&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 我 知 道 你 们 心 里 ， 没 有 神 的 爱 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But I have knowledge of you that you have no love for God in your hearts.
<br>5:43&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 奉 我 父 的 名 来 ， 你 们 并 不 接 待 我 。 若 有 别 人 奉 自 己 的 名 来 ， 你 们 倒 要 接 待 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;I have come in my Father's name, and your hearts are not open to me. If another comes with no other authority but himself, you will give him your approval.
<br>5:44&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 互 相 受 荣 耀 ， 却 不 求 从 独 一 之 神 来 的 荣 耀 ， 怎 能 信 我 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;How is it possible for you to have faith while you take honour one from another and have no desire for the honour which comes from the only God?
<br>5:45&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;不 要 想 我 在 父 面 前 要 告 你 们 。 有 一 位 告 你 们 的 ， 就 是 你 们 所 仰 赖 的 摩 西 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Put out of your minds the thought that I will say things against you to the Father: the one who says things against you is Moses, on whom you put your hopes.
<br>5:46&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 如 果 信 摩 西 ， 也 必 信 我 。 因 为 他 书 上 有 指 着 我 写 的 话 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;If you had belief in Moses you would have belief in me; for his writings are about me.
<br>5:47&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 若 不 信 他 的 书 ， 怎 能 信 我 的 话 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;If you have no belief in his writings, how will you have belief in my words?
