<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee--that is, the sea of Tiberias.
<br>6:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 许 多 人 ， 因 为 看 见 他 在 病 人 身 上 所 行 的 神 迹 ， 就 跟 随 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And a great number of people went after him because they saw the signs which he did on those who were ill.
<br>6:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 上 了 山 ， 和 门 徒 一 同 坐 在 那 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Jesus went up the mountain and was seated there with his disciples.
<br>6:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 时 犹 太 人 的 逾 越 节 近 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now the Passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.
<br>6:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 举 目 看 见 许 多 人 来 ， 就 对 腓 力 说 ， 我 们 从 哪 里 买 饼 叫 这 些 人 吃 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Lifting up his eyes, Jesus saw a great number of people coming to where he was, and he said to Philip, Where may we get bread for all these people?
<br>6:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 说 这 话 ， 是 要 试 验 腓 力 。 他 自 己 原 知 道 要 怎 样 行 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;This he said, testing him: for he had no doubt what he himself would do.
<br>6:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;腓 力 回 答 说 ， 就 是 二 十 两 银 子 的 饼 ， 叫 他 们 各 人 吃 一 点 ， 也 是 不 够 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Philip made answer, Bread to the value of two hundred pence would not be enough even to give everyone a little.
<br>6:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 一 个 门 徒 ， 就 是 西 门 彼 得 的 兄 弟 安 得 烈 ， 对 耶 稣 说 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, said to Jesus,
<br>6:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 这 里 有 一 个 孩 童 ， 带 着 五 个 大 麦 饼 ， 两 条 鱼 。 只 是 分 给 这 许 多 人 ， 还 算 什 么 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;There is a boy here with five barley cakes and two fishes: but what is that among such a number?
<br>6:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 你 们 叫 众 人 坐 下 。 原 来 那 地 方 的 草 多 ， 众 人 就 坐 下 。 数 目 约 有 五 千 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus said, Let the people be seated. Now there was much grass in that place. And those seated on the grass were about five thousand.
<br>6:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 拿 起 饼 来 ， 祝 谢 了 ， 就 分 给 那 坐 着 的 人 。 分 鱼 也 是 这 样 ， 都 随 着 他 们 所 要 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Jesus took the cakes and having given praise to God, he gave them to the people who were seated, and the fishes in the same way, as much as they had need of.
<br>6:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 吃 饱 了 ， 耶 稣 对 门 徒 说 ， 把 剩 下 的 零 碎 ， 收 拾 起 来 ， 免 得 有 糟 蹋 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when they had had enough, Jesus said to his disciples, Take up the broken bits which are over, so that nothing may be wasted.
<br>6:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 便 将 那 五 个 大 麦 饼 的 零 碎 ， 就 是 众 人 吃 了 剩 下 的 ， 收 拾 起 来 ， 装 满 了 十 二 个 篮 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So they took them up: twelve baskets full of broken bits of the five cakes which were over after the people had had enough.
<br>6:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 看 见 耶 稣 所 行 的 神 迹 。 就 说 ， 这 真 是 那 要 到 世 间 来 的 先 知 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the people saw the sign which he had done, they said, Truly, this is the prophet who is to come into the world.
<br>6:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 既 知 道 众 人 要 来 强 逼 他 作 王 ， 就 独 自 又 退 到 山 上 去 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now when Jesus saw that the people were about to come and take him by force to make him a king, he went away again up the mountain by himself.
<br>6:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;到 了 晚 上 ， 他 的 门 徒 下 海 边 去 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;When evening came the disciples went down to the sea;
<br>6:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;上 了 船 ， 要 过 海 往 迦 百 农 去 。 天 已 经 黑 了 ， 耶 稣 还 没 有 来 到 他 们 那 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they took a boat and went across the sea in the direction of Capernaum. By then it was dark and still Jesus had not come to them.
<br>6:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;忽 然 狂 风 大 作 ， 海 就 翻 腾 起 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The sea was getting rough because of a strong wind which was blowing.
<br>6:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;门 徒 摇 橹 约 行 了 十 里 多 路 ， 看 见 耶 稣 在 海 面 上 走 ， 渐 渐 近 了 船 ， 他 们 就 害 怕 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;After they had gone three or four miles they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near to the boat; and they had great fear.
<br>6:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 是 我 。 不 要 怕 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But he said to them, It is I, have no fear.
<br>6:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;门 徒 就 喜 欢 接 他 上 船 ， 船 立 时 到 了 他 们 所 要 去 的 地 方 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then they readily took him into the boat: and straight away the boat was at the land to which they were going.
<br>6:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;第 二 日 ， 站 在 海 那 边 的 众 人 ， 知 道 那 里 没 有 别 的 船 ， 只 有 一 只 小 船 ， 又 知 道 耶 稣 没 有 同 他 的 门 徒 上 船 ， 乃 是 门 徒 自 己 去 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The day after, the people who were on the other side of the sea saw that only one small boat had been there, that Jesus had not gone in that boat with the disciples, but that the disciples had gone away by themselves.
<br>6:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;然 而 有 几 只 小 船 从 提 比 哩 亚 来 ， 靠 近 主 祝 谢 后 分 饼 给 人 吃 的 地 方 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;(Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Some other boats, however, came from Tiberias near to the place where they had taken the bread after the Lord had given praise.
<br>6:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 见 耶 稣 和 门 徒 ， 都 不 在 那 里 ， 就 上 了 船 ， 往 迦 百 农 去 找 耶 稣 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So when the people saw that Jesus was not there, or his disciples, they got into those boats and went over to Capernaum looking for Jesus.
<br>6:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;既 在 海 那 边 找 着 了 ， 就 对 他 说 ， 拉 比 ， 是 几 时 到 这 里 来 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when they came across him on the other side of the sea they said, Rabbi, when did you come here?
<br>6:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 我 实 实 在 在 地 告 诉 你 们 ， 你 们 找 我 ， 并 不 是 因 见 了 神 迹 ， 乃 是 因 吃 饼 得 饱 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus, answering them, said, Truly I say to you, You come after me, not because you saw signs, but because you were given the bread and had enough.
<br>6:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;不 要 为 那 必 坏 的 食 物 劳 力 ， 要 为 那 存 到 永 生 的 食 物 劳 力 ， 就 是 人 子 要 赐 给 你 们 的 。 因 为 人 子 是 父 神 所 印 证 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Let your work not be for the food which comes to an end, but for the food which goes on for eternal life, which the Son of man will give to you, for on him has God the Father put his mark.
<br>6:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 人 问 他 说 ， 我 们 当 行 什 么 ， 才 算 作 神 的 工 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then they said to him, How may we do the works of God?
<br>6:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 信 神 所 差 来 的 ， 这 就 是 作 神 的 工 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus, answering, said to them, This is to do the work of God: to have faith in him whom God has sent.
<br>6:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 又 说 ， 你 行 什 么 神 迹 ， 叫 我 们 看 见 就 信 你 。 你 到 底 作 什 么 事 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So they said, What sign do you give us, so that we may see and have faith in you? What do you do?
<br>6:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 们 的 祖 宗 在 旷 野 吃 过 吗 哪 ， 如 经 上 写 着 说 ， 他 从 天 上 赐 下 粮 来 给 他 们 吃 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Our fathers had the manna in the waste land, as the Writings say, He gave them bread from heaven.
<br>6:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 我 实 实 在 在 地 告 诉 你 们 ， 那 从 天 上 来 的 粮 ， 不 是 摩 西 赐 给 你 们 的 ， 乃 是 我 父 将 天 上 来 的 真 粮 赐 给 你 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus then said to them, Truly I say to you, What Moses gave you was not the bread from heaven; it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.
<br>6:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 神 的 粮 ， 就 是 那 从 天 上 降 下 来 赐 生 命 给 世 界 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The bread of God is the bread which comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world.
<br>6:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 说 ， 主 阿 ， 常 将 这 粮 赐 给 我 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Ah, Lord, they said, give us that bread for ever!
<br>6:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 我 就 是 生 命 的 粮 。 到 我 这 里 来 的 ， 必 定 不 饿 。 信 我 的 ， 永 远 不 渴 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And this was the answer of Jesus: I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never be in need of food, and he who has faith in me will never be in need of drink.
<br>6:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;只 是 我 对 你 们 说 过 ， 你 们 已 经 看 见 我 ， 还 是 不 信 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But it is as I said to you: you have seen me, and still you have no faith.
<br>6:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;凡 父 所 赐 给 我 的 人 ， 必 到 我 这 里 来 。 到 我 这 里 来 的 ， 我 总 不 丢 弃 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Whatever the Father gives to me will come to me; and I will not send away anyone who comes to me.
<br>6:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 我 从 天 上 降 下 来 ， 不 是 要 按 自 己 的 意 思 行 ， 乃 是 要 按 那 差 我 来 者 的 意 思 行 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For I have come down from heaven, not to do my pleasure, but the pleasure of him who sent me.
<br>6:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;差 我 来 者 的 意 思 ， 就 是 他 所 赐 给 我 的 ， 叫 我 一 个 也 不 失 落 ， 在 末 日 却 叫 他 复 活 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And this is the pleasure of him who sent me, that I am not to let out of my hands anything which he has given me, but I am to give it new life on the last day.
<br>6:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 我 父 的 意 思 ， 是 叫 一 切 见 子 而 信 的 人 得 永 生 。 并 且 在 末 日 我 要 叫 他 复 活 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;This, I say, is my Father's pleasure, that everyone who sees the Son and has faith in him may have eternal life: and I will take him up on the last day.
<br>6:41&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;犹 太 人 因 为 耶 稣 说 ， 我 是 从 天 上 降 下 来 的 粮 ， 就 私 下 议 论 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now the Jews said bitter things about Jesus because of his words, I am the bread which came down from heaven.
<br>6:42&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;说 ， 这 不 是 约 瑟 的 儿 子 耶 稣 吗 ？ 他 的 父 母 我 们 岂 不 认 得 吗 ？ 他 如 今 怎 么 说 ， 我 是 从 天 上 降 下 来 的 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we have seen? How is it then that he now says, I have come down from heaven?
<br>6:43&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 你 们 不 要 大 家 议 论 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus made answer and said, Do not say things against me, one to another.
<br>6:44&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;若 不 是 差 我 来 的 父 吸 引 人 ， 就 没 有 能 到 我 这 里 来 的 。 到 我 这 里 来 的 ， 在 末 日 我 要 叫 他 复 活 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;No man is able to come to me if the Father who sent me does not give him the desire to come: and I will take him up from the dead on the last day.
<br>6:45&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 先 知 书 上 写 着 说 ， 他 们 都 要 蒙 神 的 教 训 。 凡 听 见 父 之 教 训 又 学 习 的 ， 就 到 我 这 里 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The writings of the prophets say, And they will all have teaching from God. Everyone whose ears have been open to the teaching of the Father comes to me.
<br>6:46&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 不 是 说 ， 有 人 看 见 过 父 ， 惟 独 从 神 来 的 ， 他 看 见 过 父 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Not that anyone has ever seen the Father; only he who is from God, he has seen the Father.
<br>6:47&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 实 实 在 在 地 告 诉 你 们 ， 信 的 人 有 永 生 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Truly I say to you, He who has faith in me has eternal life.
<br>6:48&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 就 是 生 命 的 粮 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;I am that bread of life.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;I am the bread of life.
<br>6:49&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 的 祖 宗 在 旷 野 吃 过 吗 哪 ， 还 是 死 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Your fathers took the manna in the waste land--and they are dead.
<br>6:50&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 是 从 天 上 降 下 来 的 粮 ， 叫 人 吃 了 就 不 死 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The bread which comes from heaven is such bread that a man may take it for food and never see death.
<br>6:51&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 是 从 天 上 降 下 来 生 命 的 粮 。 人 若 吃 这 粮 ， 就 必 永 远 活 着 。 我 所 要 赐 的 粮 ， 就 是 我 的 肉 ， 为 世 人 之 生 命 所 赐 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;I am the living bread which has come from heaven: if any man takes this bread for food he will have life for ever: and more than this, the bread which I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world.
<br>6:52&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 此 ， 犹 太 人 彼 此 争 论 说 ， 这 个 人 怎 能 把 他 的 肉 ， 给 我 们 吃 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then the Jews had an angry discussion among themselves, saying, How is it possible for this man to give us his flesh for food?
<br>6:53&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 我 实 实 在 在 地 告 诉 你 们 ， 你 们 若 不 吃 人 子 的 肉 ， 不 喝 人 子 的 血 ， 就 没 有 生 命 在 你 们 里 面 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, If you do not take the flesh of the Son of man for food, and if you do not take his blood for drink, you have no life in you.
<br>6:54&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;吃 我 肉 ， 喝 我 血 的 人 就 有 永 生 。 在 末 日 我 要 叫 他 复 活 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He who takes my flesh for food and my blood for drink has eternal life: and I will take him up from the dead at the last day.
<br>6:55&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 的 肉 真 是 可 吃 的 ， 我 的 血 真 是 可 喝 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;My flesh is true food and my blood is true drink.
<br>6:56&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;吃 我 肉 喝 我 血 的 人 ， 常 在 我 里 面 ， 我 也 常 在 他 里 面 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He who takes my flesh for food and my blood for drink is in me and I in him.
<br>6:57&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;永 活 的 父 怎 样 差 我 来 ， 我 又 因 父 活 着 ， 照 样 ， 吃 我 肉 的 人 ， 也 要 因 我 活 着 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;As the living Father has sent me, and I have life because of the Father, even so he who takes me for his food will have life because of me.
<br>6:58&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 就 是 从 天 上 降 下 来 的 粮 。 吃 这 粮 的 人 ， 就 永 远 活 着 ， 不 象 你 们 的 祖 宗 吃 过 吗 哪 ， 还 是 死 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;This is the bread which has come down from heaven. It is not like the food which your fathers had: they took of the manna, and are dead; but he who takes this bread for food will have life for ever.
<br>6:59&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 些 话 是 耶 稣 在 迦 百 农 会 堂 里 教 训 人 说 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus said these things in the Synagogue while he was teaching at Capernaum.
<br>6:60&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 的 门 徒 中 有 好 些 人 听 见 了 ， 就 说 ， 这 话 甚 难 ， 谁 能 听 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then, hearing this, a number of his disciples said, This is a hard saying; who is able to take in such teaching?
<br>6:61&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 心 里 知 道 门 徒 为 这 话 议 论 ， 就 对 他 们 说 ， 这 话 是 叫 你 们 厌 弃 吗 ？ （ 厌 弃 原 文 作 跌 倒 ）
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;When Jesus became conscious that his disciples were protesting about what he said, he said to them, Does this give you trouble?
<br>6:62&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;倘 或 你 们 看 见 人 子 升 到 他 原 来 所 在 之 处 ， 怎 么 样 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;What then will you say if you see the Son of man going up to where he was before?
<br>6:63&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;叫 人 活 着 的 乃 是 灵 ， 肉 体 是 无 益 的 。 我 对 你 们 所 说 的 话 ， 就 是 灵 ， 就 是 生 命 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The spirit is the life giver; the flesh is of no value: the words which I have said to you are spirit and they are life.
<br>6:64&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;只 是 你 们 中 间 有 不 信 的 人 。 耶 稣 从 起 头 就 知 道 ， 谁 不 信 他 ， 谁 要 卖 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But still some of you have no faith. For it was clear to Jesus from the first who they were who had no faith, and who it was who would be false to him.
<br>6:65&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 又 说 ， 所 以 我 对 你 们 说 过 ， 若 不 是 蒙 我 父 的 恩 赐 ， 没 有 人 能 到 我 这 里 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said, This is why I said to you, No man is able to come to me if he is not given the power to do so by the Father.
<br>6:66&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;从 此 他 门 徒 中 多 有 退 去 的 ， 不 再 和 他 同 行 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Because of what he said, a number of the disciples went back and would no longer go with him.
<br>6:67&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 就 对 那 十 二 个 门 徒 说 ， 你 们 也 要 去 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So Jesus said to the twelve, Have you a desire to go away?
<br>6:68&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;西 门 彼 得 回 答 说 ， 主 阿 ， 你 有 永 生 之 道 ， 我 们 还 归 从 谁 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Simon Peter gave this answer: Lord, to whom are we to go? you have the words of eternal life;
<br>6:69&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 们 已 经 信 了 ， 又 知 道 你 是 神 的 圣 者 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And we have faith and are certain that you are the Holy One of God.
<br>6:70&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 我 不 是 拣 选 了 你 们 十 二 个 门 徒 吗 ？ 但 你 们 中 间 有 一 个 是 魔 鬼 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Jesus said, Did I not make a selection of you, the twelve, and one of you is a son of the Evil One?
<br>6:71&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 这 话 是 指 着 加 略 人 西 门 的 儿 子 犹 大 说 的 。 他 本 是 十 二 个 门 徒 里 的 一 个 ， 后 来 要 卖 耶 稣 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He was talking of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. It was he who was to be false to Jesus--one of the twelve.
