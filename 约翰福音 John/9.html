<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he went on his way, he saw a man blind from birth.
<br>9:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;门 徒 问 耶 稣 说 ， 拉 比 ， 这 人 生 来 是 瞎 眼 的 ， 是 谁 犯 了 罪 ？ 是 这 人 呢 ？ 是 他 父 母 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And his disciples put a question to him, saying, Master, was it because of this man's sin, or the sin of his father and mother, that he has been blind from birth?
<br>9:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 也 不 是 这 人 犯 了 罪 ， 也 不 是 他 父 母 犯 了 罪 ， 是 要 在 他 身 上 显 出 神 的 作 为 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus said in answer, It was not because of his sin, or because of his father's or mother's; it was so that the works of God might be seen openly in him.
<br>9:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;趁 着 白 日 ， 我 们 必 须 作 那 差 我 来 者 的 工 。 黑 夜 将 到 ， 就 没 有 人 能 作 工 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;While it is day we have to do the works of him who sent me: the night comes when no work may be done.
<br>9:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 在 世 上 的 时 候 ， 是 世 上 的 光 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
<br>9:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 了 这 话 ， 就 吐 唾 沫 在 地 上 ， 用 唾 沫 和 泥 抹 在 瞎 子 的 眼 睛 上 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Having said these words, he put earth, mixed with water from his mouth, on the man's eyes,
<br>9:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;对 他 说 ， 你 往 西 罗 亚 池 子 里 去 洗 ， （ 西 罗 亚 翻 出 来 ， 就 是 奉 差 遣 ） 他 去 一 洗 ， 回 头 就 看 见 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And said to him, Go and make yourself clean in the bath of Siloam (the sense of the name is, Sent). So he went away and, after washing, came back able to see.
<br>9:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 的 邻 舍 ， 和 那 素 常 见 他 是 讨 饭 的 ， 就 说 ， 这 不 是 那 从 前 坐 着 讨 饭 的 人 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then the neighbours and others who had seen him before in the street, with his hand out for money, said, Is not this the man who got money from people?
<br>9:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 人 说 ， 是 他 。 又 有 人 说 ， 不 是 ， 却 是 像 他 。 他 自 己 说 ， 是 我 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Some said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am he.
<br>9:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 对 他 说 ， 你 的 眼 睛 是 怎 么 开 的 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So they said to him, How then were your eyes made open?
<br>9:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 回 答 说 ， 有 一 个 人 名 叫 耶 稣 。 他 和 泥 抹 我 的 眼 睛 ， 对 我 说 ， 你 往 西 罗 亚 池 子 去 洗 。 我 去 一 洗 ， 就 看 见 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;His answer was: The man who is named Jesus put earth mixed with water on my eyes, and said to me, Go and make yourself clean in Siloam: so I went away and, after washing, am now able to see.
<br>9:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 说 ， 那 个 人 在 哪 里 ？ 他 说 ， 我 不 知 道 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they said to him, Where is he? His answer was: I have no knowledge.
<br>9:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 把 从 前 瞎 眼 的 人 ， 带 到 法 利 赛 人 那 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;They took him before the Pharisees--this man who had been blind.
<br>9:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 和 泥 开 他 眼 睛 的 日 子 是 安 息 日 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now the day on which the earth was mixed by Jesus and the man's eyes were made open was the Sabbath.
<br>9:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;法 利 赛 人 也 问 他 是 怎 么 得 看 见 的 。 瞎 子 对 他 们 说 ， 他 把 泥 抹 在 我 的 眼 睛 上 ， 我 去 一 洗 ， 就 看 见 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So the Pharisees put more questions to him about how his eyes had been made open. And he said to them, He put earth on my eyes, and I had a wash and am able to see.
<br>9:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;法 利 赛 人 中 有 的 说 ， 这 个 人 不 是 从 神 来 的 ， 因 为 他 不 守 安 息 日 。 又 有 人 说 ， 一 个 罪 人 怎 能 行 这 样 的 神 迹 呢 ？ 他 们 就 起 了 纷 争 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then some of the Pharisees said, That man has not come from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath. Others said, How is it possible for a sinner to do such signs? So there was a division among them.
<br>9:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 又 对 瞎 子 说 ， 他 既 然 开 了 你 的 眼 睛 ， 你 说 他 是 怎 样 的 人 呢 ？ 他 说 ， 是 个 先 知 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Again they said to the blind man, What have you to say about him for opening your eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.
<br>9:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;犹 太 人 不 信 他 从 前 是 瞎 眼 ， 后 来 能 看 见 的 ， 等 到 叫 了 他 的 父 母 来 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now the Jews had no belief in the statement that he had been blind and was now able to see, till they sent for the father and mother of the man whose eyes had been made open,
<br>9:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;问 他 们 说 ， 这 是 你 们 的 儿 子 吗 ？ 你 们 说 他 生 来 是 瞎 眼 的 ， 如 今 怎 么 能 看 见 了 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And put the question to them, saying, Is this your son, of whom you say that he was blind at birth? how is it then that he is now able to see?
<br>9:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 父 母 回 答 说 ， 他 是 我 们 的 儿 子 ， 生 来 就 瞎 眼 ， 这 是 我 们 知 道 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;In answer his father and mother said, We are certain that this is our son and that he was blind at birth:
<br>9:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;至 于 他 如 今 怎 么 能 看 见 ， 我 们 却 不 知 道 。 是 谁 开 了 他 的 眼 睛 ， 我 们 也 不 知 道 。 他 已 经 成 了 人 ， 你 们 问 他 吧 。 他 自 己 必 能 说 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But how it is he is now able to see, or who made his eyes open, we are not able to say: put the question to him; he is old enough to give an answer for himself.
<br>9:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 父 母 说 这 话 ， 是 怕 犹 太 人 ， 因 为 犹 太 人 已 经 商 议 定 了 ， 若 有 认 耶 稣 是 基 督 的 ， 要 把 他 赶 出 会 堂 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;They said this because of their fear of the Jews: for the Jews had come to an agreement that if any man said that Jesus was the Christ he would be put out of the Synagogue.
<br>9:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 此 他 父 母 说 ， 他 已 经 成 了 人 ， 你 们 问 他 吧 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;That was the reason why they said, He is old enough; put the question to him.
<br>9:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;所 以 法 利 赛 人 第 二 次 叫 了 那 从 前 瞎 眼 的 人 来 ， 对 他 说 ， 你 该 将 荣 耀 归 给 神 。 我 们 知 道 这 人 是 个 罪 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So they sent a second time for the man who had been blind and they said to him, Give glory to God: it is clear to us that this man is a sinner.
<br>9:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 说 ， 他 是 个 罪 人 不 是 ， 我 不 知 道 。 有 一 件 事 我 知 道 ， 从 前 我 是 眼 瞎 的 ， 如 今 能 看 见 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He said in answer, I have no knowledge if he is a sinner or not, but one thing I am certain about; I was blind, and now I see.
<br>9:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 就 问 他 说 ， 他 向 你 作 什 么 ？ 是 怎 么 开 了 你 的 眼 睛 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then they said to him, What did he do to you? how did he give you the use of your eyes?
<br>9:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 回 答 说 ， 我 方 才 告 诉 你 们 ， 你 们 不 听 。 为 什 么 又 要 听 呢 ？ 莫 非 你 们 也 要 作 他 的 门 徒 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;His answer was: I have said it before, but your ears were shut: why would you have me say it again? is it your desire to become his disciples?
<br>9:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 就 骂 他 说 ， 你 是 他 的 门 徒 。 我 们 是 摩 西 的 门 徒 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they were angry with him and said, You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.
<br>9:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;神 对 摩 西 说 话 ， 是 我 们 知 道 的 。 只 是 这 个 人 ， 我 们 不 知 道 他 从 哪 里 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;We are certain that God gave his word to Moses: but as for this man, we have no knowledge where he comes from.
<br>9:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 人 回 答 说 ， 他 开 了 我 的 眼 睛 ， 你 们 竟 不 知 道 他 从 哪 里 来 ， 这 真 是 奇 怪 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The man said in answer, Why, here is a strange thing! You have no knowledge where he comes from though he gave me the use of my eyes.
<br>9:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 们 知 道 神 不 听 罪 人 。 惟 有 敬 奉 神 ， 遵 行 他 旨 意 的 ， 神 才 听 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;We have knowledge that God does not give ear to sinners, but if any man is a worshipper of God and does his pleasure, to him God's ears are open.
<br>9:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;从 创 世 以 来 ， 未 曾 听 见 有 人 把 生 来 是 瞎 子 的 眼 睛 开 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;In all the years nobody has ever before seen the eyes of a man blind from birth made open.
<br>9:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 人 若 不 是 从 神 来 的 ， 什 么 也 不 能 作 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;If this man did not come from God he would be unable to do anything.
<br>9:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 回 答 说 ， 你 全 然 生 在 罪 孽 中 ， 还 要 教 训 我 们 吗 ？ 于 是 把 他 赶 出 去 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Their answer was: You came to birth through sin; do you make yourself our teacher? And they put him out of the Synagogue.
<br>9:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 听 说 他 们 把 他 赶 出 去 。 后 来 遇 见 他 ， 就 说 ， 你 信 神 的 儿 子 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;It came to the ears of Jesus that they had put him out, and meeting him he said, Have you faith in the Son of man?
<br>9:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 回 答 说 ， 主 阿 ， 谁 是 神 的 儿 子 ， 叫 我 信 他 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He said in answer, And who is he, Lord? Say, so that I may have faith in him.
<br>9:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 你 已 经 看 见 他 ， 现 在 和 你 说 话 的 就 是 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus said to him, You have seen him; it is he who is talking to you.
<br>9:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 说 ， 主 阿 ， 我 信 。 就 拜 耶 稣 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said, Lord, I have faith. And he gave him worship.
<br>9:39&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 说 ， 我 为 审 判 到 这 世 上 来 ， 叫 不 能 看 见 的 ， 可 以 看 见 。 能 看 见 的 ， 反 瞎 了 眼 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jesus said, I came into this world to be a judge, so that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind.
<br>9:40&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;同 他 在 那 里 的 法 利 赛 人 ， 听 见 这 话 ， 就 说 ， 难 道 我 们 也 瞎 了 眼 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;These words came to the ears of the Pharisees who were with him and they said to him, Are we, then, blind?
<br>9:41&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 若 瞎 了 眼 ， 就 没 有 罪 了 。 但 如 今 你 们 说 ， 我 们 能 看 见 ， 所 以 你 们 的 罪 还 在 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jesus said to them, If you were blind you would have no sin: but now that you say, We see; your sin is there still.
