Pangloss! Ah, Martin! Martin! Ah, my dear Cunegonde, what sort of a world is this?" said Candide on board the Dutch ship.</p> 
<p>"Something very foolish and abominable," said Martin.</p> 
<p>"You know England? Are they as foolish there as in France?"</p> 
<p>"It is another kind of folly," said Martin. "You know that these two nations are at war for a few acres of snow in Canada,[31] and that they spend over this beautiful war much more than Canada is worth. To tell you exactly, whether there are more people fit to send to a madhouse in one country than the other, is what my imperfect intelligence will not permit. I only know in general that the people we are going to see are very atrabilious."</p>   
<p>"What is all this?" said Candide; "and what demon is it that exercises his empire in this country?"</p> 
<p>He then asked who was that fine man who had been killed with so much ceremony. They answered, he was an Admiral.[32]</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"And why kill this Admiral?"</p> 
<p>"It is because he did not kill a sufficient number of men himself. He gave battle to a French Admiral; and it has been proved that he was not near enough to him."</p> 
<p>"But," replied Candide, "the French Admiral was as far from the English Admiral."</p> 
<p>"There is no doubt of it; but in this country it is found good, from time to time, to kill one Admiral to encourage the others."</p> 
<p>Candide was so shocked and bewildered by what he saw and heard, that he would not set foot on shore, and he made a bargain with the Dutch skipper (were he even to rob him like the Surinam captain) to conduct him without delay to Venice.</p> 
<p>The skipper was ready in two days. They coasted France; they passed in sight of Lisbon, and Candide trembled. They passed through the Straits, and entered the Mediterranean. At last they landed at Venice.</p> 
<p>"God be praised!" said Candide, embracing Martin. "It is here that I shall see again my beautiful Cunegonde. I trust Cacambo as myself. All is well, all will be well, all goes as well as possible."</p>
