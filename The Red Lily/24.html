She tried to distract him with ardent gayety, with the sweetness of pressing intimacy, with superb humility. But he remained sombre. He had all night meditated, labored over, and recognized his sadness. He had found reasons for suffering. His thought had brought together the hand that dropped a letter in the post-box before the bronze San Marco and the dreadful unknown who had been seen at the station. Now Jacques Dechartre gave a face and a name to the cause of his suffering. In the grandmother’s armchair where Therese had been seated on the day of her welcome, and which she had this time offered to him, he was assailed by painful images; while she, bent over one of his arms, enveloped him with her warm embrace and her loving heart. She divined too well what he was suffering to ask it of him simply.
<br> 
<br> In order to bring him back to pleasanter ideas, she recalled the secrets of the room where they were and reminiscences of their walks through the city. She was gracefully familiar.
<br> 
<br> “The little spoon you gave me, the little red lily spoon, I use for my tea in the morning. And I know by the pleasure I feel at seeing it when I wake how much I love you.”
<br> 
<br> Then, as he replied only in sentences sad and evasive, she said:
<br> 
<br> “I am near you, but you do not care for me. You are preoccupied by some idea that I do not fathom. Yet I am alive, and an idea is nothing.”
<br> 
<br> “An idea is nothing? Do you think so? One may be wretched or happy for an idea; one may live and one may die for an idea. Well, I am thinking.”
<br> 
<br> “Of what are you thinking?”
<br> 
<br> “Why do you ask? You know very well I am thinking of what I heard last night, which you had concealed from me. I am thinking of your meeting at the station, which was not due to chance, but which a letter had caused, a letter dropped — remember! — in the postbox of San Michele. Oh, I do not reproach you for it. I have not the right. But why did you give yourself to me if you were not free?”
<br> 
<br> She thought she must tell an untruth.
<br> 
<br> “You mean some one whom I met at the station yesterday? I assure you it was the most ordinary meeting in the world.”
<br> 
<br> He was painfully impressed with the fact that she did not dare to name the one she spoke of. He, too, avoided pronouncing that name.
<br> 
<br> “Therese, he had not come for you? You did not know he was in Florence? He is nothing more to you than a man whom you meet socially? He is not the one who, when absent, made you say to me, ‘I can not?’ He is nothing to you?”
<br> 
<br> She replied resolutely:
<br> 
<br> “He comes to my house at times. He was introduced to me by General Lariviere. I have nothing more to say to you about him. I assure you he is of no interest to me, and I can not conceive what may be in your mind about him.”
<br> 
<br> She felt a sort of satisfaction at repudiating the man who had insisted against her; with so much harshness and violence, upon his rights of ownership. But she was in haste to get out of her tortuous path. She rose and looked at her lover, with beautiful, tender, and grave eyes.
<br> 
<br> “Listen to me: the day when I gave my heart to you, my life was yours wholly. If a doubt or a suspicion comes to you, question me. The present is yours, and you know well there is only you, you alone, in it. As for my past, if you knew what nothingness it was you would be glad. I do not think another woman made as I was, to love, would have brought to you a mind newer to love than is mine. That I swear to you. The years that were spent without you — I did not live! Let us not talk of them. There is nothing in them of which I should be ashamed. To regret them is another thing. I regret to have known you so late. Why did you not come sooner? You could have known me five years ago as easily as to-day. But, believe me, we should not tire ourselves with speaking of time that has gone. Remember Lohengrin. If you love me, I am for you like the swan’s knight. I have asked nothing of you. I have wanted to know nothing. I have not chided you about Mademoiselle Jeanne Tancrede. I saw you loved me, that you were suffering, and it was enough — because I loved you.”
<br> 
<br> “A woman can not be jealous in the same manner as a man, nor feel what makes us suffer.”
<br> 
<br> “I do not know that. Why can not she?”
<br> 
<br> “Why? Because there is not in the blood, in the flesh of a woman that absurd and generous fury for ownership, that primitive instinct of which man has made a right. Man is the god who wants his mate to himself. Since time immemorial woman is accustomed to sharing men’s love. It is the past, the obscure past, that determines our passions. We are already so old when we are born! Jealousy, for a woman, is only a wound to her own self-love. For a man it is a torture as profound as moral suffering, as continuous as physical suffering. You ask the reason why? Because, in spite of my submission and of my respect, in spite of the alarm you cause me, you are matter and I am the idea; you are the thing and I am the mind; you are the clay and I am the artisan. Do not complain of this. Near the perfect amphora, surrounded with garlands, what is the rude and humble potter? The amphora is tranquil and beautiful; he is wretched; he is tormented; he wills; he suffers; for to will is to suffer. Yes, I am jealous. I know what there is in my jealousy. When I examine it, I find in it hereditary prejudices, savage conceit, sickly susceptibility, a mingling of rudest violence and cruel feebleness, imbecile and wicked revolt against the laws of life and of society. But it does not matter that I know it for what it is: it exists and it torments me. I am the chemist who, studying the properties of an acid which he has drunk, knows how it was combined and what salts form it. Nevertheless the acid burns him, and will burn him to the bone.”
<br> 
<br> “My love, you are absurd.”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, I am absurd. I feel it better than you feel it yourself. To desire a woman in all the brilliancy of her beauty and her wit, mistress of herself, who knows and who dares; more beautiful in that and more desirable, and whose choice is free, voluntary, deliberate; to desire her, to love her for what she is, and to suffer because she is not puerile candor nor pale innocence, which would be shocking in her if it were possible to find them there; to ask her at the same time that she be herself and not be herself; to adore her as life has made her, and regret bitterly that life, which has made her so beautiful, has touched her — Oh, this is absurd! I love you! I love you with all that you bring to me of sensations, of habits, with all that comes of your experiences, with all that comes from him-perhaps, from them-how do I know? These things are my delight and they are my torture. There must be a profound sense in the public idiocy which says that love like ours is guilty. Joy is guilty when it is immense. That is the reason why I suffer, my beloved.”
<br> 
<br> She knelt before him, took his hands, and drew him to her.
<br> 
<br> “I do not wish you to suffer; I will not have it. It would be folly. I love you, and never have loved any one but you. You may believe me; I do not lie.”
<br> 
<br> He kissed her forehead.
<br> 
<br> “If you deceived me, my dear, I should not reproach you for that; on the contrary, I should be grateful to you. Nothing is so legitimate, so human, as to deceive pain. What would become of us if women had not for us the pity of untruth? Lie, my beloved, lie for the sake of charity. Give me the dream that colors black sorrow. Lie; have no scruples. You will only add another illusion to the illusion of love and beauty.”
<br> 
<br> He sighed:
<br> 
<br> “Oh, common-sense, common wisdom!”
<br> 
<br> She asked him what he meant, and what common wisdom was. He said it was a sensible proverb, but brutal, which it was better not to repeat.
<br> 
<br> “Repeat it all the same.”
<br> 
<br> “You wish me to say it to you: ‘Kissed lips do not lose their freshness.’”
<br> 
<br> And he added:
<br> 
<br> “It is true that love preserves beauty, and that the beauty of women is fed on caresses as bees are fed on flowers.”
<br> 
<br> She placed on his lips a pledge in a kiss.
<br> 
<br> “I swear to you I never loved any one but you. Oh, no, it is not caresses that have preserved the few charms which I am happy to have in order to offer them to you. I love you! I love you!”
<br> 
<br> But he still remembered the letter dropped in the post-box, and the unknown person met at the station.
<br> 
<br> “If you loved me truly, you would love only me.”
<br> 
<br> She rose, indignant:
<br> 
<br> “Then you believe I love another? What you are saying is monstrous. Is that what you think of me? And you say you love me! I pity you, because you are insane.”
<br> 
<br> “True, I am insane.”
<br> 
<br> She, kneeling, with the supple palms of her hands enveloped his temples and his cheeks. He said again that he was mad to be anxious about a chance and commonplace meeting. She forced him to believe her, or, rather, to forget. He no longer saw or knew anything. His vanished bitterness and anger left him nothing but the harsh desire to forget everything, to make her forget everything.
<br> 
<br> She asked him why he was sad.
<br> 
<br> “You were happy a moment ago. Why are you not happy now?”
<br> 
<br> And as he shook his head and said nothing:
<br> 
<br> “Speak! I like your complaints better than your silence.”
<br> 
<br> Then he said:
<br> 
<br> “You wish to know? Do not be angry. I suffer now more than ever, because I know now what you are capable of giving.”
<br> 
<br> She withdrew brusquely from his arms and, with eyes full of pain and reproach, said:
<br> 
<br> “You can believe that I ever was to another what I am to you! You wound me in my most susceptible sentiment, in my love for you. I do not forgive you for this. I love you! I never have loved any one except you. I never have suffered except through you. Be content. You do me a great deal of harm. How can you be so unkind?”
<br> 
<br> “Therese, one is never kind when one is in love.”
<br> 
<br> She remained for a long time immovable and dreamy. Her face flushed, and a tear rose to her eyes.
<br> 
<br> “Therese, you are weeping!”
<br> 
<br> “Forgive me, my heart, it is the first time that I have loved and that I have been really loved. I am afraid.”
