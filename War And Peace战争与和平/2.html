The people of the highest distinction in Petersburg were there, people very different in ages and characters, but alike in the set in which they moved. The daughter of Prince Vassily, the beauty, Ellen, came to fetch her father and go with him to the ambassador's fête. She was wearing a ball-dress with an imperial badge on it. The young Princess Bolkonsky was there, celebrated as the most seductive woman in Petersburg. She had been married the previous winter, and was not now going out into the great world on account of her interesting condition, but was still to be seen at small parties. Prince Ippolit, the son of Prince Vassily, came too with Mortemart, whom he introduced. The Abbé Morio was there too, and many others.</p> 
<p>“Have you not yet seen, or not been introduced to ma tante?” Anna Pavlovna said to her guests as they arrived, and very seriously she led them up to a little old lady wearing tall bows, who had sailed in out of the next room as soon as the guests began to arrive. Anna Pavlovna mentioned their names, deliberately turning her eyes from the guest to ma tante, and then withdrew. All the guests performed the ceremony of greeting the aunt, who was unknown, uninteresting and unnecessary to every one. Anna Pavlovna with mournful, solemn sympathy, followed these greetings, silently approving them. Ma tante said to each person the same words about his health, her own health, and the health of her majesty, who was, thank God, better to-day. Every one, though from politeness showing no undue haste, moved away from the old lady with a sense of relief at a tiresome duty accomplished, and did not approach her again all the evening. The young Princess Bolkonsky had come with her work in a gold-embroidered velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, faintly darkened with down, was very short over her teeth, but was all the more charming when it was lifted, and still more charming when it was at times drawn down to meet the lower lip. As is always the case with perfectly charming women, her defect — the shortness of the lip and the half-opened mouth — seemed her peculiar, her characteristic beauty. Every one took delight in watching the pretty creature full of life and gaiety, so soon to be a mother, and so lightly bearing her burden. Old men and bored, depressed young men gazing at her felt as though they were becoming like her, by being with her and talking a little while to her. Any man who spoke to her, and at every word saw her bright little smile and shining white teeth, gleaming continually, imagined that he was being particularly successful this evening. And this each thought in turn.</p> 
<p>The little princess, moving with a slight swing, walked with rapid little steps round the table with her work-bag in her hand, and gaily arranging the folds of her gown, sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar; it seemed as though everything she did was a festival for herself and all around her.</p> 
<p>“I have brought my work,” she said, displaying her reticule, and addressing the company generally. “Mind, Annette, don't play me a nasty trick,” she turned to the lady of the house; “you wrote to me that it was quite a little gathering. See how I am got up.”</p> 
<p>And she flung her arms open to show her elegant grey dress, trimmed with lace and girt a little below the bosom with a broad sash.</p> 
<p>“Never mind, Lise, you will always be prettier than any one else,” answered Anna Pavlovna.</p> 
<p>“You know my husband is deserting me,” she went on in just the same voice, addressing a general; “he is going to get himself killed. Tell me what this nasty war is for,” she said to Prince Vassily, and without waiting for an answer she turned to Prince Vassily's daughter, the beautiful Ellen.</p> 
<p>“How delightful this little princess is!” said Prince Vassily in an undertone to Anna Pavlovna.</p> 
<p>Soon after the little princess, there walked in a massively built, stout young man in spectacles, with a cropped head, light breeches in the mode of the day, with a high lace ruffle and a ginger-coloured coat. This stout young man was the illegitimate son of a celebrated dandy of the days of Catherine, Count Bezuhov, who was now dying at Moscow. He had not yet entered any branch of the service; he had only just returned from abroad, where he had been educated, and this was his first appearance in society. Anna Pavlovna greeted him with a nod reserved for persons of the very lowest hierarchy in her drawing-room. But, in spite of this greeting, Anna Pavlovna's countenance showed signs on seeing Pierre of uneasiness and alarm, such as is shown at the sight of something too big and out of place. Though Pierre certainly was somewhat bigger than any of the other men in the room, this expression could only have reference to the clever, though shy, observant and natural look that distinguished him from every one else in the drawing-room.</p> 
<p>“It is very kind of you, M. Pierre, to have come to see a poor invalid,” Anna Pavlovna said to him, exchanging anxious glances with her aunt, to whom she was conducting him.</p> 
<p>Pierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued searching for something with his eyes. He smiled gleefully and delightedly, bowing to the little princess as though she were an intimate friend, and went up to the aunt. Anna Pavlovna's alarm was not without grounds, for Pierre walked away from the aunt without waiting to the end of her remarks about her majesty's health. Anna Pavlovna stopped him in dismay with the words: “You don't know Abbé Morio? He's a very interesting man,” she said.</p> 
<p>“Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it's very interesting, but hardly possible …”</p> 
<p>“You think so?” said Anna Pavlovna in order to say something and to get away again to her duties as hostess, but Pierre committed the opposite incivility. Just now he had walked off without listening to the lady who was addressing him; now he detained by his talk a lady who wanted to get away from him. With head bent and legs planted wide apart, he began explaining to Anna Pavlovna why he considered the abbé's scheme chimerical.</p> 
<p>“We will talk of it later,” said Anna Pavlovna, smiling.</p>  
<p>安娜·帕夫洛夫娜的客厅渐渐挤满了来宾。彼得堡的有名望的显贵都来赴会了，就其年龄和性情而言，这些人虽然各不相同，但是就其生活的社会而言，却是相同的。瓦西里公爵的女儿——貌美的海伦前来赴会了，她顺路来接父亲，以便一同去出席公使的庆祝大会。她佩戴花字奖章，身穿舞会的艳装。知名的、年轻的、身材矮小的叫做博尔孔斯卡娅的公爵夫人，LafemmelaplusséduisantedePétersbourg①，也来赴会了；她于去冬出阁，因为怀胎，眼下不能跻身于稠人广众的交际场所，但仍旧出席小型晚会。瓦西里公爵的儿子伊波利特随同他所举荐的莫特马尔也来赴会了；此外，前来赴会的还有莫里约神父和许多旁的人。 </p> 
<p>“我还没有见过（或者：您和Matante②不相识吧？）。”安娜·帕夫洛夫娜对各位来宾说，又一本正经地把他们领到小老太太跟前，她头上束着高高的蝴蝶结，当宾客快要到来时，便从另一个房间从容平稳地走出来；安娜·帕夫洛夫娜喊出一个个来客的名字，同时把目光慢慢地从客人移到matante身上，之后她就走开了。 </p> 
<p>①彼得堡的迷人的女人。</p> 
<p>②法语：我的姑母。</p>  
<p>年轻的名叫博尔孔斯卡娅的公爵夫人来了，她随身带着一个金线织的丝绒袋子，内中装有针线活儿。她那长有略带黑色绒毛的令人悦目的上唇，翘起来，露出了上牙，正因为这样，上唇启开时，就显得愈加好看，有时候上唇向前伸出或者搭在下唇上，就愈益好看了。她的缺点——翘嘴唇、微微张开的口——似乎已构成她的特殊的美。无论谁看见这个身体健壮、充满活力、即令是怀胎，依然一身轻快的、长相十分好看的未来的母亲，都感到无比喜悦。老年人和阴郁而烦闷的年青人，设若和她在一块待上片刻，聊聊天，就好像变得和她一个模样了。谁和她聊过天，看见她每说一句话都会露出来爽朗的微笑，看见她那雪白的、闪闪发亮的牙齿，就会感到今天受宠若惊，飘飘然。每个人脑子里都会浮现出这种想法。</p> 
<p>身材矮小的公爵夫人手上提着一个装有针线活的袋子，迈着急速的碎步，蹒跚地绕过桌子，愉快地弄平连衣裙，便在银质茶炊旁的长沙发上坐下来，仿佛她无论做什么事情，对她本人和她周围的人，都是一件partiedeplaisir。①“J'aiapportémonouvrage，”②她打开女用手提包，把脸转向大家说道。</p> 
<p>“您瞧吧，Annette，nemejouezpasunmauvais′tour，”她把脸转向女主人说话。“Vousm'avezécrit，quec'étaitunetoutepetitesoirée；voyezcommejesuisattifée．”③ </p> 
<p>①法语：开心事。</p> 
<p>②法语：我把针线活儿随身带来了。</p> 
<p>③法语：不要恶毒地跟我开玩笑，您写给我的信上说，你们举行一个小型的晚会。您瞧，我已经围上披肩了。</p>  
<p>“Soyeztranquille，Lise，voussereztoujourslaplusjolie，”①安娜·帕夫洛夫娜回答。</p> 
<p>“Voussavez，monmarim'abandonne。”她把脸转向一位将军，用同样的语调继续说下去，“ilvasefairetuer．Ditesmoi，pourquoicettevilaineguerre，”②她对瓦西里公爵说道，不等他回答，便转过身来和公爵的女儿——貌美的海伦谈话。</p> 
<p>“Quelledélicieusepersonnequecettepetiteprincesse！”③瓦西里公爵轻言细语地对安娜·帕夫洛夫娜说道。 </p> 
<p>①法语：丽莎，请您放心吧，您毕竟比谁都漂亮。</p> 
<p>②法语：您知道，我的丈夫要把我抛弃了。他要去拼死卖命。请您告诉我，这种万恶的战争是为了什么目的啊！</p> 
<p>③法语：这个身材矮小的公爵夫人，是个多么讨人喜欢的人啊！</p>  
<p>“C'estbienaimableàvous，monsieurPierre，d'etrevenuvoirunepauvremalade，”①安娜·帕夫洛夫娜对他说道，把他带到姑母面前，惊惶失措地和她互使眼色。皮埃尔嘟哝着说了一句令人不懂的话，继续不停地用眼睛探寻着什么。他欢快地微微一笑，像对亲密的朋友那样，向身材矮小的公爵夫人鞠躬行礼，接着便向姑母面前走去。安娜·帕夫洛夫娜的惊惶失措的神态并不是无缘无故的，因为皮埃尔还没有听完姑母讲太后的健康情形，便从她身旁走开了。安娜·帕夫洛夫娜心慌意乱地用话阻拦他。 </p> 
<p>①法语：皮埃尔先生，您真是太好了，来探望一个可怜的女病人。</p>  
<p>“是的，我听过有关他所提出的永久和平的计划。这真是十分有趣，不过未必有可能……”</p> 
<p>“您有这样的想法？……”安娜·帕夫洛夫娜说道，她本想随便聊聊，再去做些家庭主妇的活儿，但是皮埃尔竟然做出一反常态的缺少礼貌的举动。原先他没有听完对话人的话就走开了，此刻他却说些闲话来拦住需要离开他的对话人。他便垂着头，叉开他两条大腿，开始向安娜·帕夫洛夫娜证明，他为何认为神父的计划纯粹是幻想。</p> 
<p>“我们以后来谈吧。”安娜·帕夫洛夫娜说道，流露出一丝微笑。</p> 
<p>她摆脱了那个不善于生活的年轻人之后，便回过头来去干家庭主妇的活儿，继续留心地听听，仔细地看看，准备去帮助哪个谈得不带劲的地方的人。像一个纺纱作坊的老板，让劳动者就位以后，便在作坊里踱来踱去，发现纺锤停止转动，或者声音逆耳，轧轧作响、音量太大时，就赶快走去制动纺车，或者使它运转自如——安娜·帕夫洛夫娜也是这样处理事情的，她在自己客厅里踱来踱去，不时地走到寂然无声或者谈论过多的人群面前，开口说句话或者调动他们的坐位，于是又使谈话机器从容不迫地、文质彬彬地转动起来。但是在她这样照料的当儿，依然看得出她分外担心皮埃尔。当皮埃尔走到莫特马尔周围的人们近旁听听他们谈话，后来又走到有神父发言的那一群人面前的时候，她总是怀着关切的心态注视着皮埃尔。对于在外国受过教育的皮埃尔来说，安娜·帕夫洛夫娜的这次晚会，是他在俄国目睹的第一个晚会。他知道，彼得堡的知识分子都在这里集会，他真像个置身于玩具商店的孩童那样，看不胜看，眼花缭乱。他老是惧怕错失他能听到的深奥议论的机会。他亲眼望见在这里集会的人们都现出充满信心而又文雅的表情，他老是等待能听到特别深奥的言论。末了，他向莫里约面前走去。他心里觉得他们的谈话十分有趣，他于是停了下来，等待有机会说出自己的主见，就像年轻人那样，个个喜欢这一着。</p>
