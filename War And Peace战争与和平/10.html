There she stopped listening to the talk in the drawing-room, and waiting for Boris to come out. She was beginning to get impatient, and stamping her foot was almost ready to cry at his not coming at once, when she heard the young man's footsteps coming out discreetly, not too slowly nor too quickly. Natasha darted swiftly away and hid among the tubs of shrubs.</p> 
<p>Boris stood still in the middle of the room, looked round him, brushed a speck of dirt off the sleeve of his uniform, and going up to the looking-glass examined his handsome face. Natasha, keeping quiet, peeped out of her hiding-place, waiting to see what he would do. He stood a little while before the glass, smiled at his reflection, and walked towards the other door. Natasha was on the point of calling to him, but she changed her mind. “Let him look for me,” she said to herself. Boris had only just gone out, when at the other door Sonya came in, flushed and muttering something angrily through her tears. Natasha checked her first impulse to run out to her, and remained in her hiding-place, as it were under the invisible cap, looking on at what was going on in the world. She began to feel a peculiar novel sort of enjoyment in it. Sonya was murmuring something as she looked towards the drawing-room door. The door opened and Nikolay came in.</p> 
<p>“Sonya! what is the matter? how can you?” said Nikolay, running up to her.</p> 
<p>“Nothing, nothing, leave me alone!” Sonya was sobbing.</p> 
<p>“No, I know what it is.”</p> 
<p>“Very well, you do, so much the better then, and you can go back to her.”</p> 
<p>“So-o-onya! one word! How can you torture me and yourself for a mere fancy?” said Nikolay, taking her hand. Sonya did not pull her hand away, and left off crying.</p> 
<p>Natasha, not stirring and hardly breathing, looked with shining eyes from her hiding-place. “What's coming now?” she thought.</p> 
<p>“Sonya! I care for nothing in the whole world! You're everything to me,” said Nikolay. “I'll prove it to you.”</p> 
<p>“I don't like you to talk like that.”</p> 
<p>“Well, I won't then; come, forgive me, Sonya.” He drew her to him and kissed her.</p> 
<p>“Oh, that's nice,” thought Natasha, and when Sonya and Nikolay had gone out of the room she followed them and called Boris to her.</p> 
<p>“Boris, come here,” she said with a sly and significant look. “I've something I want to tell you. Here, here,” she said, and she led him into the conservatory, to the place where she had hidden between the tubs. Boris followed her, smiling.</p> 
<p>“What is the something?” he inquired. She was a little embarrassed; she looked round her, and seeing her doll flung down on a tub she picked it up.</p> 
<p>“Kiss the doll,” she said. Boris looked with observant, affectionate eyes at her eager face and made no answer. “Don't you want to? Well, then come here,” she said, and went further in among the shrubs and tossed away the doll. “Closer, closer!” she whispered. She caught hold of the young officer's arms above the cuff, and her flushed face had a look of solemnity and awe.</p> 
<p>“Would you like to kiss me?” she whispered, hardly audibly, peeping up at him from under her eyelids, smiling and almost crying with excitement.</p> 
<p>Boris reddened. “How absurd you are!” he said, bending down to her, flushing redder still, but doing nothing, waiting what would come next. Suddenly she jumped on to a tub, so that as she stood she was taller than he, flung both arms round him so that her slender, bare arms clasped him above his neck, and flinging back her hair with a toss of her head, she kissed him just on his lips.</p> 
<p>She slipped away among the flower-pots on the other side, and stood with hanging head.</p> 
<p>“Natasha,” he said, “you know I love you, but—”</p> 
<p>“You're in love with me,” Natasha broke in.</p> 
<p>“Yes I am, but, please, don't let us do like that.… In another four years… Then I shall ask for your hand.” Natasha pondered a moment.</p> 
<p>“Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen …” she said, counting on her thin little fingers.</p> 
<p>“Very well. Then it's settled?” And her excited face beamed with a smile of delight and relief.</p> 
<p>“Settled!” said Boris.</p> 
<p>“For ever?” said the little girl. “Till death?” And taking his arm, with a happy face she walked quietly beside him into the next room.</p>  
<p>鲍里斯在房间中央停步了，环顾了一遭，掸掉制服袖子上的尘屑，走到镜台前，仔细瞧瞧他那俊美的面孔。娜塔莎没有出声，从她躲匿的地方向外观望，等待着，看他怎样办。他在镜台前伫立了片刻，微微一笑，就向大门口走去。娜塔莎想喊他一声，随即改变了念头。</p> 
<p>“让他去找吧，”她对自己说道。鲍里斯刚刚走出来，索尼娅涨红了脸，透过泪水愤恨地低声细语，从另一道门走了出来。娜塔莎忍住了，没有起步向她身边跑去，还留在躲匿的地方，宛如戴上一顶隐身帽，不时地窥视人世间的动静。她正在享受一种特别新鲜的乐趣。索尼娅用耳语说着什么话，又回头望望客厅门。尼古拉从门口走出来了。</p> 
<p>“索尼娅，你怎么啦？哪能这样呢？”尼古拉说道，向她身边跑来了。</p> 
<p>“没有什么，没有什么，丢下我别管吧！”索尼娅嚎啕大哭起来。</p> 
<p>“不，我知道干嘛。”</p> 
<p>“哦，您知道，好得很，您上她那儿去吧。”</p> 
<p>“索——尼娅！有句话要跟你说！哪能凭瞎想这样折磨我，这样折磨你自己！”尼古拉说道，一把抓住她的手。</p> 
<p>索尼娅不去挣脱自己的手，停止哭泣了。</p> 
<p>娜塔莎屏住气息，一动不动地从她躲匿的地方用那闪闪发亮的眼睛向外张望。“此刻会出什么事呢？”她思忖道。</p> 
<p>“索尼娅！我所需要的不是整个世界！在我心目中唯有你才是一切，”尼古拉说道，“我向你证明我说的话。”</p> 
<p>“我不喜欢你这样说话。”</p> 
<p>“哦，我再也不说了，嗯，索尼娅，宽恕我吧！”他把她拖到自己身边，吻了吻她。</p> 
<p>“嗬，多么好啊！”娜塔莎心里想道，索尼娅和尼古拉从房里走出以后，她跟随着他们，把鲍里斯喊到自己身边来。</p> 
<p>“鲍里斯，您到这里来，”她现出一副意味深长的狡黠的神态说道，“我有一件事要说给您听。到这里来吧，到这里来吧。”她说道，把他领到花房里她躲匿过的花桶之间。鲍里斯微露笑容，跟在她后面走去。</p> 
<p>“这究竟是件什么事呢？”他发问。</p> 
<p>她困窘不安，向四下打量一番，看见她那被扔在花桶上的洋娃娃，把它拿起来。</p> 
<p>“吻吻这个洋娃娃吧。”她说道。</p> 
<p>鲍里斯用关切而温和的目光望着她那兴奋的脸盘，一声也不回答。</p> 
<p>“您不愿意吗？喂，就到这儿来吧，”她说道，并向花丛纵深走去，扔掉了那个洋娃娃，“靠近点，靠近点吧！”她轻言细语地说道。她双手抓住军官的袖口，在她那涨红了的脸上可以望见激动和恐惧的神色。</p> 
<p>“您愿意吻吻我吗？”她低声细语，几乎听不清楚，皱着眉头向他瞧着，脸上露出微笑，激动得几乎要哭出声来。</p> 
<p>鲍里斯面红耳赤。</p> 
<p>“您多么可笑！”他说道，向她弯下腰来，面红得更加厉害，但却没有采取任何行动，只是等待好机会。</p> 
<p>她突然跳到花桶上，身段就显得比他高了，她用自己的双手把他抱住了，于是她那纤细的裸露的手臂在他的颈项上方弯成弧形了，她仰起头来，把头发甩在后面，正好在他的唇上吻了一下。</p> 
<p>她经过花钵中间窜到花丛的另一边，低垂着头，停步不前了。</p> 
<p>“娜塔莎，”他说道，“您知道我是爱您的，可是……”</p> 
<p>“您爱上我了吗？”娜塔莎打断了他的话。</p> 
<p>“是的，我爱上您了，但是您瞧，真是的，我们以后不要像刚才那样冒冒失失……还有四个年头……那时候我会向您求婚。”</p> 
<p>娜塔莎思忖了一下。</p> 
<p>“十三岁，十四岁，十五岁，十六岁……”她说道，弯屈着她那纤细的指头算算，“很好！那么成了定局罗？”</p> 
<p>欣喜和安定的微笑使她兴奋的面部神采奕奕。</p> 
<p>“成定局了！”鲍里斯说道。</p> 
<p>“永远吗？”小女孩说道，“一直到寿终正寝？”</p> 
<p>她于是挽着他的手臂，露出幸运的神色，静悄悄地和他并排走到摆满沙发的休息室里去。</p>
