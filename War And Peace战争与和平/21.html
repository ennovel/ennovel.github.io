They were mute at once on seeing Pierre and his companion, and the princess concealed something as Pierre fancied and murmured: “I can't stand the sight of that woman.”</p> 
<p>“Katish has had tea served in the little drawing-room,” Prince Vassily said to Anna Mihalovna. “Go, my poor Anna Mihalovna, take something or you will not hold out.”</p> 
<p>To Pierre he said nothing; he simply pressed his arm sympathetically. Pierre and Anna Mihalovna went on into the little drawing-room.</p> 
<p>“There is nothing so reviving as a cup of this excellent Russian tea, after a sleepless night,” said Lorrain with an air of restrained briskness, sipping it out of a delicate china cup without a handle, as he stood in the little circular drawing-room close to a table laid with tea-things and cold supper-dishes. All who were in Count Bezuhov's house on that night had, with a view to fortifying themselves, gathered around the table. Pierre remembered well that little circular drawing-room with its mirrors and little tables. When there had been balls in the count's house, Pierre, who could not dance, had liked sitting in that little room full of mirrors, watching the ladies in ball-dresses with pearls and diamonds on their bare shoulders, as they crossed that room and looked at themselves in the brightly lighted mirrors that repeated their reflections several times. Now the same room was dimly lighted with two candles, and in the middle of the night the tea-set and supper-dishes stood in disorder on one of the little tables, and heterogeneous, plainly dressed persons were sitting at it, whispering together, and showing in every word that no one could forget what was passing at that moment and what was still to come in the bedroom. Pierre did not eat anything, though he felt very much inclined to. He looked round inquiringly towards his monitress, and perceived that she had gone out again on tiptoe into the reception-room where Prince Vassily had remained with the eldest princess. Pierre supposed that this too was an inevitable part of the proceedings, and, after a little delay, he followed her. Anna Mihalovna was standing beside the princess, and they were both talking at once in excited tones.</p> 
<p>“Allow me, madam, to know what is and what is not to be done,” said the princess, who was apparently in the same exasperated temper as she had been when she slammed the door of her room.</p> 
<p>“But, dear princess,” Anna Mihalovna was saying mildly and persuasively, blocking up the way towards the bedroom and not letting the princess pass. “Would that not be too great a tax on poor uncle at such a moment, when he needs repose? At such moments to talk of worldly matters when his soul is already prepared …”</p> 
<p>Prince Vassily was sitting in a low chair in his habitual attitude, with one leg crossed high above the other. His cheeks were twitching violently, and when they relaxed, they looked heavier below; but he wore the air of a man little interested in the two ladies' discussion.</p> 
<p>“No, my dear Anna Mihalovna, let Katish act on her own discretion. You know how the count loves her.”</p> 
<p>“I don't even know what is in this document,” said the princess, addressing Prince Vassily, and pointing to the inlaid portfolio which she held in her hand. “All I know is that the real will is in the bureau, and this is a paper that has been forgotten. …”</p> 
<p>She tried to get round Anna Mihalovna, but the latter, with another little skip, barred her way again.</p> 
<p>“I know, dear, sweet princess,” said Anna Mihalovna, taking hold of the portfolio, and so firmly that it was clear she would not readily let go of it again. “Dear princess, I beg you, I beseech you, spare him. I entreat you.”</p> 
<p>The princess did not speak. All that was heard was the sound of a scuffle over the portfolio. There could be no doubt that if she were to speak, she would say nothing complimentary to Anna Mihalovna. The latter kept a tight grip, but in spite of that her voice retained all its sweet gravity and softness.</p> 
<p>Pierre, come here, my dear boy. He will not be one too many, I should imagine, in a family council; eh, prince?”</p> 
<p>“Why don't you speak, mon cousin?” the princess shrieked all of a sudden, so loudly that they heard her voice, and were alarmed by it in the drawing-room. “Why don't you speak when here a meddling outsider takes upon herself to interfere, and make a scene on the very threshold of a dying man's room? Scheming creature,” she muttered viciously, and tugged at the portfolio with all her might, but Anna Mihalovna took a few steps forward so as not to lose her grasp of it and changed hands.</p> 
<p>“Ah,” said Prince Vassily, in reproachful wonder. He got up. “It is ridiculous. Come, let go. I tell you.” The princess let go.</p> 
<p>“And you.”</p> 
<p>Anna Mihalovna did not heed him.</p> 
<p>“Let go, I tell you. I will take it all upon myself. I will go and ask him. I … you let it alone.”</p> 
<p>“But, prince,” said Anna Mihalovna, “after this solemn sacrament, let him have a moment's peace. Here, Pierre, tell me your opinion,” she turned to the young man, who going up to them was staring in surprise at the exasperated face of the princess, which had thrown off all appearance of decorum, and the twitching cheeks of Prince Vassily.</p> 
<p>“Remember that you will have to answer for all the consequences,” said Prince Vassily sternly; “you don't know what you are doing.”</p> 
<p>“Infamous woman,” shrieked the princess, suddenly pouncing on Anna Mihalovna and tearing the portfolio from her. Prince Vassily bowed his head and flung up his hands.</p> 
<p>At that instant the door, the dreadful door at which Pierre had gazed so long, and which had opened so softly, was flung rapidly, noisily open, banging against the wall, and the second princess ran out wringing her hands.</p> 
<p>“What are you about?” she said, in despair. “He is passing away, and you leave me alone.”</p> 
<p>The eldest princess dropped the portfolio. Swiftly Anna Mihalovna stooped and, snatching up the object of dispute, ran into the bedroom. The eldest princess and Prince Vassily recovering themselves followed her. A few minutes later the eldest princess came out again with a pale, dry face, biting her underlip. At the sight of Pierre her face expressed irrepressible hatred.</p> 
<p>“Yes, now you can give yourself airs,” she said, “you have got what you wanted.” And breaking into sobs, she hid her face in her handkerchief and ran out of the room.</p> 
<p>The next to emerge was Prince Vassily. He staggered to the sofa, on which Pierre was sitting, and sank on to it, covering his eyes with his hand. Pierre noticed that he was pale, and that his lower jaw was quivering and working as though in ague.</p> 
<p>“Ah, my dear boy,” he said, taking Pierre by the elbow—and there was a sincerity and a weakness in his voice that Pierre had never observed in him before—“what sins, what frauds we commit, and all for what? I'm over fifty, my dear boy. … I too. … It all ends in death, all. Death is awful.” He burst into tears.</p> 
<p>Anna Mihalovna was the last to come out. She approached Pierre with soft, deliberate steps. “Pierre,” she said. Pierre looked inquiringly at her. She kissed the young man on the forehead, wetting him with her tears. She did not speak for a while.</p> 
<p>“He is no more. …”</p> 
<p>Pierre gazed at her over his spectacles.</p> 
<p>“Come. I will take you back. Try to cry. Nothing relieves like tears.”</p> 
<p>She led him into the dark drawing-room, and Pierre was glad that no one could see his face. Anna Mihalovna left him, and when she came back he was fast asleep with his arm under his head.</p> 
<p>The next morning Anna Mihalovna said to Pierre: “Yes, my dear boy, it is a great loss for us all. I do not speak of you. But God will uphold you; you are young, and now you are at the head of an immense fortune, I hope. The will has not been opened yet. I know you well enough to know that this will not turn your head, but it will impose duties upon you and you must be a man.”</p> 
<p>Pierre did not speak.</p> 
<p>“Perhaps, later, I may tell you, my dear boy, that if I had not been there God knows what would have happened. You know, my uncle promised me, only the day before yesterday, not to forget Boris. But he had no time. I hope, dear friend, that you will fulfil your father's desire.”</p> 
<p>Pierre did not understand a word, and colouring shyly, looked dumbly at Anna Mihalovna. After talking to him, Anna Mihalovna drove to the Rostovs', and went to bed. On waking in the morning, she told the Rostovs and all her acquaintances the details of Count Bezuhov's death. She said that the count had died, as she would wish to die herself, that his end had been not simply touching, but edifying; that the last interview of the father and son had been so touching that she could not recall it without tears; and that she did not know which had behaved more nobly in those terrible moments: the father, who had remembered everything and every one so well at the last, and had said such moving words to his son; or Pierre, whom it was heartbreaking to see, so utterly crushed was he, though he yet tried to conceal his grief, so as not to distress his dying father. “It is painful, but it does one good; it uplifts the soul to see such men as the old count and his worthy son,” she said. She told them about the action of the princess and Prince Vassily too, but in great secrecy, in whispers, and with disapproval.</p>  
<p>皮埃尔仿佛看见公爵的大小姐把一样东西藏起来，并且轻言细语地说道：</p> 
<p>“我不能跟这个女人见面。”</p> 
<p>“Caticheafaitdonnerduthédanslepetitesalon，”瓦西里公爵对安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜说道，“Allez，mapauvre安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜，prenezquequeclhose，autrementvousnesuffirezpas．”③</p> 
<p>他对皮埃尔什么话也没有说，只是亲切地握握他的手。皮埃尔和安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜向petitAalon④走去。 </p> 
<p>①法语：他昏迷不醒了。</p> 
<p>②法语：我们走吧。</p> 
<p>③法语：卡季什已经吩咐人将茶端进小客厅去了。可怜的安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜，您最好去提提精神，否则您会没有力气的。</p> 
<p>④法语：小客厅。</p>  
<p>①法语：在不眠之夜以后，再没有什么比一碗十分可口的俄国茶更能恢复精力的了。</p>  
<p>“可是，亲爱的公爵小姐，”安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜拦住通往寝室的路，不让公爵小姐走过去，她温和而恳切地说，“在可怜的叔叔需要休息的时刻，这样做不会使他太难受么？在他已经有了精神准备的时刻，竟然谈论世俗的事情……”</p> 
<p>瓦西里公爵坐在安乐椅上，一条腿高高地架在另一条腿上，现出十分亲热的姿态。他的腮帮子深陷，下部看起来更为肥厚，跳动得很厉害，但是他摆出一副不太关心两个女士谈论的样子。</p> 
<p>“Voyons，mabonne，安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜，laissezfaireCatiche①，您知道，伯爵多么喜爱她啊。”</p> 
<p>“这份文件中包含有什么，我真的不知道，”公爵小姐把脸转向瓦西里公爵，并用手指着她拿在手里的镶花皮包，说道，“我只知道他的真遗嘱搁在旧式写字台里，而这是一份被遗忘的文件……”</p> 
<p>她想从安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜身边绕过去，但安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜跳到她跟前，拦住她的去路。</p> 
<p>“亲爱的、慈善的公爵小姐，我知道，”安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜说道，用手抓着皮包，抓得很紧，看起来她不会很快松手的，“亲爱的公爵小姐，我求您，我央求您，怜悯怜悯他。</p> 
<p>Jevousenconjure……”② </p> 
<p>①法语：不过，我亲爱的安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜，让卡季什去做她知道做的事吧。</p> 
<p>②法语：我央求您。</p>  
<p>“皮埃尔，我的朋友，到这里来。我想，他在亲属商议事情时不是多馀的。公爵，不是这样吗？”</p> 
<p>“我的表兄，干嘛不作声？”公爵的大小姐突然叫喊起来，喊声很大，客厅里也能听见，可把大家吓坏了，“天晓得有个什么人胆敢在这里干涉别人的事，在临近死亡的人家里大吵大闹，您干嘛在这个时候一声不吭？一个施耍阴谋诡计的女人！”她凶恶地轻声说道，使尽全身力气去拖皮包，但是安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜向前走了几步，不想放开那个皮包，换一只手把它抓住了。</p> 
<p>“哎呀！”瓦西里公爵露出责备和惊讶的神态说，他站起身来。“C'estridicule，voyons①，放开吧，我说给您听吧。”</p> 
<p>公爵的大小姐放开手了。</p> 
<p>“您也放开手！”</p> 
<p>安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜没有听从他。</p> 
<p>“放开，我说给您听吧。我对一切负责。我去问他。我……</p> 
<p>您别这样了。”</p> 
<p>“Mais，monnpuince，”②安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜说道，“在举行这样盛大的圣礼以后，让他安静片刻吧。皮埃尔，您把您的意见说出来，”她把脸转向年轻人说道；皮埃尔走到他们近侧，诧异地打量着公爵小姐那副凶狠的，丧失体统的面孔和瓦西里公爵的不停地颤动的两颊。 </p> 
<p>①法语：这真可笑。得啦吧。</p> 
<p>②法语：但是，我的公爵。</p>  
<p>“讨厌的女人！”公爵小姐嚷道，忽然向安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜扑了过去，夺取那皮包。</p> 
<p>瓦西里公爵低下头来，把两手一摊。</p> 
<p>这时分，那扇房门——素来都是轻轻地打开的令人可怖的房门，皮埃尔久久地望着，房门忽然砰地一声被推开了，撞到墙壁上，公爵的二小姐从那里跑出来，把两手举起轻轻一拍。</p> 
<p>“你们在做什么事？”她无所顾忌地说道，“Ils'envaetvousmelaissezseule．”① </p> 
<p>①法语：他快要死了，可你们把我一个人留在那里。</p>  
<p>“对了，您现在高兴了，”她说道，“这是您所期待的。”</p> 
<p>她于是嚎啕大哭起来，用手绢蒙住脸，从房里跑出去了。</p> 
<p>瓦西里公爵跟在公爵的大小姐后面走出去。他步履踉跄地走到皮埃尔坐的长沙发前面，用一只手蒙住眼睛，跌倒在长沙发上。皮埃尔发现他脸色苍白，下颔跳动着，颤栗着，像因冷热病发作而打战似的。</p> 
<p>“哎呀，我的朋友！”他一把抓住皮埃尔的胳膊肘，说道，嗓音里带有一种诚实的软弱的意味，这是皮埃尔过去从未发觉到的，“我们造了多少孽，我们欺骗多少人，这一切为了什么？我的朋友，我已经五十多岁了……要知道，我……人一死，什么都完了，都完了。死是非常可怕的。”他大哭起来。</p> 
<p>安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜最后一人走出来。她用徐缓的脚步走到皮埃尔面前。</p> 
<p>“皮埃尔！……”她说道。</p> 
<p>皮埃尔以疑问的目光望着她。她吻吻年轻人的前额，眼泪把它沾湿了。她沉默了片刻。</p> 
<p>“Iln'estplus…”①</p> 
<p>皮埃尔透过眼镜望着她。</p> 
<p>“Allons，jevousreconduiraiTachezdepleurer．Riennesoulage，commeleslarmes．”② </p> 
<p>①法语：他不在世了。</p> 
<p>②法语：我们走吧，我送您去。想法子哭吧，没有什么比眼泪更能使人减轻痛苦。</p>  
<p>翌日清晨，安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜对皮埃尔说：</p> 
<p>“Oui，moncher，c'estunegrandepertepournoustous，Jeneparlepasdevous．Maisdieuvoussoutiendra，vousêtesjeuneetvousvoilàalateted'uneimmensefortune，jel'espère，Letestanentn'apasétéencoreouvert，Jevousconnaisassezpoursavoirquecelanevoustounrnerapaslatête，maiscelavousim－posedesdevoirs，etilfautêtre</p>

<p>皮埃尔沉默不言。</p> 
<p>“Peut—êtreplustardjevousdirai，moncher，quesijen'avaispasetela，Dieusaitcequiseraitarrive．Voussavezmononcleavant—hierencoremepromettaitdenepasoubliBerBoris．Maisiln'apaseuletemps．J'espère，moncherami，quevousremplirezledésirdevotrepère．”② </p> 
<p>①法语：对，我的朋友，即使不提及您，这对于我们所有的人也是极大的损失。但是上帝保佑您，您很年轻，我希望您如今是一大笔财产的拥有者。遗嘱还没有拆开来，对于您的情形我相当熟悉，坚信这不会使您冲昏头脑。但是这要您承担义务，您要做个大丈夫。</p> 
<p>②法语：以后我也许会说给您听的，如果我不在那里，天知道会发生什么事。您知道，叔父前天答应我不要不顾鲍里斯，但是他来不及了。我的朋友，我希望您能履行父亲的意愿。</p>  
<p>bien：caelèvel'amedevoirdeshommes，commelevieuxcomteetsondignefils。”①她说道。她也秘而不宣地、低声地谈到公爵的大小姐和瓦西里公爵的行为，但却不予以赞扬。 </p> 
<p>①法语：这是令人难受的，却是富有教育意义的，当你看见老伯爵和他的当之无愧的儿子时，灵魂就变得高尚了。</p>
