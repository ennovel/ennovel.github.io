The countess was longing for a tête-à-tête talk with the friend of her childhood, Anna Mihalovna, whom she had not seen properly since she had arrived from Petersburg. Anna Mihalovna, with her tear-worn and amiable face, moved closer up to the countess's easy-chair.</p> 
<p>“With you I will be perfectly open,” said Anna Mihalovna. “We haven't many old friends left. That's how it is I value your friendship so.”</p> 
<p>Anna Mihalovna looked at Vera and stopped. The countess pressed her friend's hand.</p> 
<p>“Vera,” said the countess to her eldest daughter, unmistakably not her favourite, “how is it you have no notion about anything? Don't you feel that you're not wanted here? Go to your sister or …”</p> 
<p>The handsome young countess smiled scornfully, apparently not in the least mortified.</p> 
<p>“If you had told me, mamma, I would have gone away long ago,” she said, and went off towards her own room. But passing through the divan-room, she noticed two couples sitting symmetrically in the two windows. She stopped and smiled contemptuously at them. Sonya was sitting close beside Nikolay, who was copying out some verses for her, the first he had ever written. Boris and Natasha were sitting in the other window, and were silent when Vera came in. Sonya and Natasha looked at Vera with guilty, happy faces.</p> 
<p>It was an amusing and touching sight to see these little girls in love, but the sight of them did not apparently arouse any agreeable feeling in Vera. “How often have I asked you,” she said, “not to take my things? You have a room of your own.” She took the inkstand away from Nikolay.</p> 
<p>“One minute, one minute,” he said, dipping his pen in.</p> 
<p>“You always manage to do things just at the wrong moment,” said Vera. “First you burst into the drawing-room so that every one was ashamed of you.” Although or just because what she said was perfectly true, no one answered; all the four simply looked at one another. She lingered in the room with the inkstand in her hand. “And what sort of secrets can you have at your age, Natasha and Boris, and you two!—it's all simply silly nonsense!”</p> 
<p>“Well, what has it to do with you, Vera?” Natasha said in defence, speaking very gently. She was evidently more good-humoured and affectionate than usual that day with every one.</p> 
<p>“It's very silly,” said Vera; “I am ashamed of you. What sort of secret…”</p> 
<p>“Every one has secrets. We don't interfere with you and Berg,” said Natasha, getting warmer.</p> 
<p>“I should think you didn't interfere,” said Vera, “because there could be no harm in any conduct of mine. But I shall tell mamma how you behave with Boris.”</p> 
<p>“Natalya Ilyinishna behaves very well to me,” said Boris. “I have nothing to complain of,” he said.</p> 
<p>“Leave off, Boris, you're such a diplomatist” (the world diplomatist was much in use among the children in the special sense they attached to the word). “It's tiresome, really,” said Natasha, in a mortified and shaking voice; “why does she set upon me?”</p> 
<p>“You'll never understand it,” she said, addressing Vera, “because you've never cared for any one; you've no heart; you're simply Madame de Genlis” (this nickname, considered most offensive, had been given to Vera by Nikolay), “and your greatest delight is in getting other people into trouble. You can flirt with Berg, as much as you like,” she said quickly.</p> 
<p>“Well, I'm not likely to run after a young man before visitors.…”</p> 
<p>“Well, she has gained her object!” Nikolay put in; “she has said something nasty to every one, and upset everybody. Let's go into the nursery.”</p> 
<p>All four rose, like a flock of scared birds, and went out of the room.</p> 
<p>“You've said nasty things to me, and I said nothing to any one,” said Vera.</p> 
<p>“Madame de Genlis! Madame de Genlis!” cried laughing voices through the door.</p> 
<p>The handsome girl who produced such an irritating and unpleasant effect on every one smiled; and, obviously unaffected by what had been said to her, she went up to the looking-glass and put her scarf and her hair tidy. Looking at her handsome face, she seemed to become colder and more composed than ever.</p> 
<p>In the drawing-room the conversation was still going on.</p> 
<p>“Ah, chère,” said the countess, “in my life, too, everything is not rose-coloured. Do you suppose I don't see that, in the way we are going on, our fortune can't last long? And it's all the club and his good-nature. When we're in the country we have no rest from it,—it's nothing but theatricals, hunting parties, and God knows what. But we won't talk of me. Come, tell me how you managed it all. I often wonder at you, Annette, the way you go racing off alone, at your age, to Moscow, and to Petersburg, to all the ministers, and all the great people, and know how to get round them all too. I admire you, really! Well, how was it arranged? Why, I could never do it.”</p> 
<p>“Ah, my dear!” answered Princess Anna Mihalovna, “God grant that you never know what it is to be left a widow, with no one to support you, and a son whom you love to distraction. One learns how to do anything,” she said with some pride. “My lawsuit trained me to it. If I want to see one of these great people, I write a note: ‘Princess so-and-so wishes to see so-and-so,' and I go myself in a hired cab two or three times—four, if need be—till I get what I want. I don't mind what they think of me.”</p> 
<p>“Well, tell me, then, whom did you interview for Borinka?” asked the countess. “Here's your boy an officer in the Guards, while my Nikolinka's going as an ensign. There's no one to manage things for him. Whose help did you ask?”</p> 
<p>“Prince Vassily's. He was so kind. Agreed to do everything immediately; put the case before the Emperor,” said Princess Anna Mihalovna enthusiastically, entirely forgetting all the humiliation she had been through to attain her object.</p> 
<p>“And how is he? beginning to get old, Prince Vassily?” inquired the countess. “I have never seen him since our theatricals at the Rumyantsovs', and I dare say he has forgotten me. He paid me attentions,” the countess recalled with a smile.</p> 
<p>“He's just the same,” answered Anna Mihalovna, “so affable, brimming over. Greatness has not turned his head. ‘I am sorry I can do so little for you, Princess,' he said to me; ‘I'm at your command.' Yes, he's a splendid man, and very good to his relatives. But you know, Natalie, my love for my boy. I don't know what I would not do to make him happy. And my means are so scanty,” pursued Anna Mihalovna, dropping her voice mournfully, “that now I am in a most awful position. My wretched lawsuit is eating up all I have, and making no progress. I have not, can you conceive it, literally, not sixpence in the world, and I don't know how to get Boris's equipment.” She took out her handkerchief and shed tears. “I must have five hundred roubles, and I have only a twenty-five rouble note. I'm in such a position.… My one hope now is in Prince Kirill Vladimirovitch Bezuhov. If he will not come to the help of his godson—you know he is Boris's godfather—and allow him something for his maintenance, all my efforts will have been in vain; I shall have nothing to get his equipment with.”</p> 
<p>The countess deliberated in tearful silence.</p> 
<p>“I often think—perhaps it's a sinful thought,” said the princess—“but I often think: here is Prince Kirill Vladimirovitch Bezuhov living all alone … that immense fortune … and what is he living for? Life is a burden to him, while Boris is only just beginning life.”</p> 
<p>“He will be sure to leave something to Boris,” said the countess.</p> 
<p>“God knows, chère amie! These wealthy grand people are such egoists. But still I'm going to see him at once with Boris, and I will tell him plainly the state of the case. People may think what they choose of me, I really don't care, when my son's fate depends on it.” The princess got up. “It's now two o'clock, and you dine at four. I shall have time to drive there and back.”</p> 
<p>And with the air of a Petersburg lady, used to business, and knowing how to make use of every moment, Anna Mihalovna sent for her son, and with him went out into the hall.</p> 
<p>“Good-bye, my dear,” she said to the countess, who accompanied her to the door. “Wish me good-luck,” she added in a whisper unheard by her son.</p> 
<p>“You're going to Prince Kirill Vladimirovich's, ma chère?” said the count, coming out of the dining-room into the hall. “If he's better, invite Pierre to dine with us. He has been here; used to dance with the children. Be sure you invite him, ma chère. Now do come and look how Taras has surpassed himself to-day. He says Count Orlov never had such a dinner as we're going to have to-day.”</p>  
<p>“我对你直言不讳，”安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜说道，“我们这些老朋友剩存的已经很少了！因此，我十分珍惜你的友情。”</p> 
<p>安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜望了望薇拉，便停住了。伯爵夫人握了握朋友的手。</p> 
<p>“薇拉，”伯爵夫人把脸转向显然不受宠爱的长女，说道，“您怎么一点不明事理啊？难道你不觉得，你在这里是个多余的人吗？到几个妹妹那里去吧，或者……”</p> 
<p>貌美的薇拉鄙夷地微露笑容，显然她一点也不感到屈辱。</p> 
<p>“妈妈，假如您老早对我说了这番话，我老早就会离开您了。”她说了这句话，便向自己房里去了。</p> 
<p>但是，当她路过摆满沙发的休息室时，她发觉休息室里有两对情人在两扇窗户近侧对称地坐着。她停步了，鄙视地微微一笑。索尼娅坐在尼古拉近侧，他把他头次创作的诗句誊写给她看。鲍里斯和娜塔莎坐在另一扇窗户旁边，当薇拉走进来时，他们都默不作声了。索尼娅和娜塔莎带着愧悔、但却幸福的神态，瞥了薇拉一眼。</p> 
<p>看见这些热恋的小姑娘，真令人高兴和感动。但是她们的样子在薇拉身上显然没有引起愉快的感觉。</p> 
<p>“我请求你们多少次了，”她说道，“不要拿走我的东西，你们都有你们自己的房间。”她拿起尼古拉身边的墨水瓶。</p> 
<p>“我马上给你，马上给你。”他说道，把笔尖蘸上墨水了。</p> 
<p>“你们向来不善于适合时宜地做事情，”薇拉说道，“方才你们跑到客厅里来，真教大家替你们害臊。”</p> 
<p>虽然她说的话完全合情合理，莫非正因为如此，所以没有人回答，这四个人只是互使眼色而已。她手里拿着墨水瓶迟迟未起步，在房里滞留。</p> 
<p>“你们这样的年纪，会有什么秘密，娜塔莎和鲍里斯之间，你们二人之间会有什么秘密，会是一些愚蠢事。”</p> 
<p>“嘿，薇拉，这与你何干。”娜塔莎用低沉的嗓音作辩护。</p> 
<p>这天她对大家显然比平常更慈善，更温和。</p> 
<p>“很愚蠢，”薇拉说道，“我替你们害臊，这是什么秘密呢？</p> 
<p>……”</p> 
<p>“每个人都有自己的秘密。我们不招惹你和贝格就是了。”</p> 
<p>娜塔莎急躁地说……</p> 
<p>“我认为，你们不会触犯人，”薇拉说道，“因为我从来没有什么不轨的行为。看吧，你怎样对待鲍里斯，我准会告诉妈妈。”</p> 
<p>“娜塔莉娅·伊利尼什娜待我非常好，”鲍里斯说道，“我不会诉怨的。”他说道。</p> 
<p>“鲍里斯，请您不要管，您是这么一个外交家（外交家这个词在儿童中间广为流传，他们使这个词具有一种特殊意义），真够乏味，”娜塔莎用委屈的颤栗的嗓音说道，“她干嘛跟着我，纠缠得没完没了？这一点你永远也不会明白，”她把脸转向薇拉说道，“因为你从来没有爱过任何人；你简直没有心肠，你只是个ma－damedeGenlis①（尼古拉给薇拉起的侮辱人的绰号），你主要的乐趣就是给他人制造不愉快的事情。你去向贝格献媚吧，你想怎样献媚就怎样献媚。”她急匆匆地说道。 </p> 
<p>①法语：让莉夫人。</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“是的，我也许不会在客人们面前去追逐一个年轻人……”</p> 
<p>“得啦，你达到目的了，”尼古拉插话了，“在大家面前说了许多讨厌的话，真使大家扫兴了。我们到儿童室去吧。”</p> 
<p>这四个人有如一群惊弓之鸟都站立起来，从房里走出去了。</p> 
<p>“人家对我说了许多讨厌的话，可我没有对谁说什么。”薇拉说道。</p> 
<p>“madamedeGenlis！madamedeGenlis！”有人从门后传出一阵笑语。</p> 
<p>貌美的薇拉给了大家一种令人激动的不愉快的印象，但她却微微一笑；大家说的话显然对她不发生作用，她向镜台前走去。把围巾和头发弄平，一面注视着她那美丽的面孔，她显然变得更冷漠，更安详了。</p> 
<p>客厅中的谈话持续下去了。</p> 
<p>“啊！亲爱的，”伯爵夫人说道，“在我的生活上toutn'estpasrose，我难道看不见吗，dutrain，quenousallons①，我们的财富不能长久地维系下去！这个俱乐部和他的慈善，全都碍了事。我们住在乡下，我们难道会静心养性吗？戏院呀，狩猎呀，天知道还有什么花样。至于我的情形，又有什么可谈的呢？哦，这一切一切你究竟是怎样安排的啊？安内特，我对你的境况常常感到惊讶，你这个年纪，怎么一个人乘坐马车，去莫斯科，去彼得堡，到各位部长那里去，到各个贵族那里去，你善于应酬各种人，真令我感到惊奇！嗬，这方面的事情究竟是怎样妥善安排的啊？这方面的事情我一点也不内行。” </p> 
<p>①法语：依照我们这种生活方式，并非幸福盈门，尽如人意。</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“啊，我的心肝！”名叫安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜的公爵夫人答道，“但愿你不要知道，当一个寡妇，无依无靠，还有一个你所溺爱的儿子，生活多么艰苦，什么事都得学会，”她带着有点傲气的神态继续说道，“这场诉讼让我学了乖。如果我要会见某位显要达官，我就写一封便函：‘Princesseunetelle①欲晋谒某人，'我于是外出走一趟。我坐上马车亲自造访，哪怕走两趟也好，走三趟、四趟也好，直至达到目的为止。无论别人对我持有什么看法，对我来说，横直一样。”</p> 
<p>“喂，你怎样替鲍里斯求情的呢？”伯爵夫人问道，“要知道，你的儿子已经是近卫军军官了，而尼古拉才当上士官生。</p> 
<p>没有人为他斡旋哩。你向谁求过情呢？”</p> 
<p>“我向瓦西里公爵求过情。他真是殷勤待人。现在他什么都答应了，并且禀告了国王。”名叫安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜的公爵夫人异常高兴地说道，完全忘记了她为达到目的而遭受的凌辱。</p> 
<p>“瓦西里公爵怎么样？变老了吧？”伯爵夫人问道，“自从我们在鲁缅采夫家演了那幕闹剧以后，我就没有见过他。我想，他已经忘记我了。Ilmefaisaitlacour，”②伯爵夫人面露微笑地想起这件事。</p> 
<p>“他还是那个样子，”安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜答道，“他很殷勤地待人，满口说的是奉承讨好的话。Lesgrandeursneluiontpastournélatêtedutout③。‘亲爱的公爵夫人，我感到遗憾的是，我能替您做的事太少了，'他对我说道，‘如有事就请吩咐吧。'不过，他是个享有荣誉的人，是个挺好的亲戚，娜塔莎，可你总知道，我疼爱自己的儿子。我不知道。为了他的幸福我有什么事不能做到啊。我的境况糟糕透了，”安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜降低嗓门心情忧悒地继续说下去，“我的情况糟糕透了，使我现在处于最难堪的地位。我那倒霉的讼案把我拥有的一切吞噬掉了，而且毫无进展。你可以想象我没有金钱，àlalettre④竟然没有十戈比的小银币，我不知道要用什么给鲍里斯置备军装，”她掏出一条手绢，哭起来了，“我现在需要五百卢布，而我身边只有一张二十五卢布的纸币。我处于这种境地……现在我唯一的希望寄托在基里尔弗拉基米罗维奇·别祖霍夫伯爵身上。如果他不愿意支援他的教子——要知道他曾给鲍里斯施洗礼——，不愿意发给他一笔薪金，那么，我的奔走斡旋势必付诸东流；我将用什么给他置备军装啊。” </p> 
<p>①法语：某公爵夫人。</p> 
<p>②法语：他轻浮地追求过我。</p> 
<p>③法语：荣耀的地位没有使他变样子。</p> 
<p>④法语：有时候。</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>伯爵夫人两眼噙着泪水，沉默地想着什么事。</p> 
<p>“我常常想到，这也许就是罪孽，”那公爵夫人说道，“我常常想到，基里尔·弗拉基米罗维奇·别祖霍夫伯爵孤单地生活……他有这么多产业……他的生活目的何在？对他来说，生命是沉重的负担，可是鲍里斯才刚刚开始生活。”</p> 
<p>“他想必会给鲍里斯留下什么财产。”伯爵夫人说道。</p> 
<p>“chèreamie①，天晓得！这些富翁和显贵都是利己主义者。但是我还是即刻偕同鲍里斯到他那里去，坦率地对他说明，究竟是怎么一回事。人家对我抱有什么看法，请听便吧，说实话，只要儿子的命运有赖于此事，我一切都不在乎，”公爵夫人站立起来，“现在是两点钟，四点钟你们吃午餐。我出去走走还来得及哩。” </p> 
<p>①法语：亲爱的朋友。</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜具有精明能干、善于利用时间的彼得堡贵族夫人的作风，她派人去把儿子喊来，和他一同到接待室去。</p> 
<p>“我的心肝，再会吧，”她对送她到门口的伯爵夫人说道，“请你祝我成功吧。”她背着儿子轻言细语地补充说一句。</p> 
<p>“machère，您到基里尔·弗拉基米罗维奇伯爵那里去吗？”伯爵从餐厅出来，也到接待室去时，说道，“如果皮埃尔身体好一些，请他上我家里来吃午饭。要知道，他时常到我这里来，和孩子们一块跳舞。machère，务必要请他。哦，让我们看看，塔拉斯今天怎样大显神通啊。他说，奥尔洛夫伯爵家里未曾举办像我们今天这样的午宴哩。”</p>
