Stavros says the oil companies have the price hike they wanted for now, and the government has told them to cool it or face an excess profits tax. Melanie says the world will turn to the bicycle, as Red China has already done; she has bought herself a twelve?speed Fuji with her waitress's wages, and on fair days pedals around the mountain and down, her chestnut curls flying, through Cityview Park into Brewer. Toward the end of July comes a week of record heat; the papers are full of thermal statistics and fuzzy photographs of the time at the turn of the century when the trolley tracks warped in Weiser Square, it was so hot. Such heat presses out from within, against our clothes; we want to break out, to find another self beside the sea or in the mountains. Not until August will Harry and Janice go to the Poconos, where the Springers have a cottage they rent to other people for July. All over Brewer, air?conditioners drip onto patios and into alleyways.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> On an afternoon of such hot weather, with his Corona still having bodywork done, Harry borrows a Caprice trade?in from the lot and drives southwest toward Galilee. On curving roads he passes houses of sandstone, fields of corn, a cement factory, a billboard pointing to a natural cave (didn't natural caves go out of style a while ago?), and another billboard with a great cutout of a bearded Amishman advertising "Authentic Dutch Smorgasbord'' Galilee is what they call a string town, a hilly row of house with a feed store at one end and a tractor agency at the other. In the middle stands an old wooden inn with a deep porch all along the second story and a renovated restaurant on the first with a window full of credit card stickers to catch the busloads of tourists that come up from Baltimore, blacks most of them, God knows what they hope to see out here in the sticks. A knot of young locals is hanging around in front of the Rexall's, you never used to see that in farm country, they'd be too busy with the chores. There is an old stone trough, a black?lacquered row of hitching posts, a glossy new bank, a traffic island with a monument Harry cannot make out the meaning of, and a small brick post office with its bright silver letters GALILEE up a side street that in a block dead?ends at the edge of a field. The woman in the post office tells Harry where the Nunemacher farm is, along R. D. 2. By the landmarks she gives him ? a vegetable stand, a pond rimmed with willows, a double silo close to the road ? he feels his way through the tummocks and swales of red earth crowded with shimmering green growth, merciless vegetation that allows not even the crusty eroded road embankments to rest barren but makes them bear tufts and mats of vetch and honeysuckle vines and fills the stagnant hot air with the haze of exhaled vapor. The Caprice windows are wide open and the Brewer disco station fades and returns in twists of static as the land and electrical wires obtrude. NUNEMACHER is a faded name on a battered tin mailbox. The house and barn are well back from the road, down a long dirt lane, brown stones buried in pink dust.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit's heart rises in his chest. He cruises the road, surveying the neighboring mailboxes; but Ruth gave him, when he once met her by accident in downtown Brewer a dozen years ago, no clue to her new name, and the girl a month ago refused to write hers in his showroom ledger. All he has to go by, other than Nunemacher's being his daughter's neighbor, if she is his daughter, is Ruth's mentioning that her husband besides being a farmer ran a fleet of school buses. He was older than she and should be dead now, Harry figures. The school buses would be gone. The mailboxes along this length of road say BLANKENBILLER, MUTH, and BYER. It is not easy to match the names with the places, as glimpsed in their hollows, amid their trees, at the end of their lanes of grass and dirt. He feels conspicuous, gliding along in a magenta Caprice, though no other soul emerges from the wide landscape to observe him. The thickwalled houses hold their inhabitants in, this hazy mid?afternoon too `hot for work. Harry drives down a lane at random and stops and backs around in the beaten, rutted space between the buildings while some pigs he passed in their pen set up a commotion of snorting and a fat woman in an apron comes out of a door of the house. She is shorter than Ruth and younger than Ruth would be now, with black hair pulled tight beneath a Mennonite cap. He waves and keeps going. This was the Blankenbillers, he sees by the mailbox as he pulls onto the road again.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The other two places are nearer the road and he thinks he might get closer on foot. He parks on a widened stretch of shoulder, packed earth scored by the herringbone of tractor tire treads. When he gets out of the car, the powerful sweetish stench of the Blankenbillers' pigsty greets him from a distance, and what had seemed to be silence settles into his ear as a steady dry hum of insects, an undercoat to the landscape. The flowering weeds of mid?summer, daisies and Queen Anne's lace and chicory, thrive at the side of the road and tap his pants legs as he hops up onto the bank. In his beige summerweight salesman's suit he prowls behind a hedgerow of sumac and black gum and wild cherry overgrown with poison ivy, shining leaves of it big as valentines and its vines having climbed to the tips of strangled trees. The roughly shaped sandstones of a tumbled old wall lie within this hedgerow, hardly one upon another. At a gap where wheeled vehicles have been driven through he stands surveying the cluster of buildings below him ? barn and house, asbestos?sided chicken house and slat?sided corn crib, both disused, and a newish building of cement?block with a roof of corrugated overlapped Fiberglas. Some kind of garage, it looks like. On the house roof has been mounted a copper lightning rod oxidized green and an H?shaped television aerial, very tall to catch the signals out here. Harry means only to survey, to relate this layout to the Nunemacher spread across the next shaggy rise, but a soft clinking arising from somewhere amid the buildings, and the ripples a little runnel makes pouring itself into a small pond perhaps once for ducks, and an innocent clutter of old tractor seats and axles and a rusted iron trough in a neglected patch between the woodpile and the mowed yard lure him downward like a species of music while he chums in his head the story he will tell if approached and challenged. This soft dishevelled farm feels like a woman's farm, in need of help. An unreasonable expectancy brings his heart up to the pitch of the surrounding insect?hum.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Then he sees it, behind the barn, where the woods are encroaching upon what had once been a cleared space, sumac and cedar in the lead: the tilted yellow shell of a school bus. Its wheels and windows are gone and the snub hood of its cab has been torn away to reveal a hollow space where an engine was cannibalized; but like a sunken galleon it testifies to an empire, a fleet of buses whose proprietor has died, his widow left with an illegitimate daughter to raise. The land under Rabbit seems to move, with the addition of yet another citizen to the subterrain of the dead.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry stands in what once had been an orchard, where even now lopsided apple and pear trees send up sprays of new shoots from their gutted trunks. Though the sun burns, wetness at the root of the orchard grass has soaked his suede shoes. If he ventures a few steps farther he will be in the open and liable to be spotted from the house windows. There are voices within the house he can hear now, though they have the dim steady rumble that belongs to voices on radio or television. A few steps farther, he could distinguish these voices. A few steps farther still, he will be on the lawn, beside a plaster birdbath balanced off?center on a pillar of blue?tinted fluting, and then he will be committed to stride up bravely, put his foot on the low cement porch, and knock. The front door, set deep in its socket of stone, needs its green paint refreshed. From the tattered composition shingles of its roof to the dreary roller shades that hang in its windows the house exhales the tired breath of poverty.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> What would he say to Ruth if she answered his knock?
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Hi. You may not remember me . . .
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Jesus. I wish I didn't.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> No, wait. Don't close it. Maybe I can help you.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> How the hell would you ever help me? Get out. Honest to God, Rabbit, just looking at you makes me sick.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> I have money now.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> I don't want it. I don't want anything that stinks of you. When I did need you, you ran.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> O.K., O.K. But let's look at the present situation. There's this girl of ours
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Girl, she's a woman. Isn't she lovely? I'm so proud.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Me too. We should have had lots. Great genes.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Don't be so fucking cute. I've been here for twenty years, where have you been?
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> It's true, he could have tried to look her up, he even knew she lived around Galilee. But he hadn't. He hadn't wanted to face her, the complicated and accusing reality of her. He wanted to hold her in his mind as just fucked and satisfied, lifting white and naked above him on an elbow. Before he drifted off to sleep she got him a drink of water. He does not know if he loved her or not, but with her he had known love, had experienced that cloudy inflation of self which makes us infants again and tips each moment with a plain excited purpose, as these wands of grass about his knees are tipped with packets of their own fine seeds.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> A door down below slams, not on the sides of the house he can see. A voice sounds the high note we use in speaking to pets. Rabbit retreats behind an apple sapling too small to hide him. In his avidity to see, to draw closer to that mysterious branch of his past that has flourished without him, and where lost energy and lost meaning still flow, he has betrayed his big body, made it a target. He crowds so close to the little tree that his lips touch the bark of its crotch, bark smooth as glass save where darker ridges of roughness at intervals ring its gray. The miracle of it: how things grow, always remembering to be themselves. His lips have flinched back from the unintended kiss. Living microscopic red things ? mites, aphids, he can see them ? will get inside him and multiply.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hey!" a voice calls. A woman's voice, young on the air, frightened and light. Could Ruth's voice be so young after so many years?
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rather than face who it is, he runs. Up through the heavy orchard grass, dodging among the old fruit trees, breaking through as if a sure lay?up waits on the other side of the ragged hedgerow, onto the red tractor path and back to the Caprice, checking to see if he tore his suit as he trots along, feeling his age. He is panting; the back of his hand is scratched, by raspberries or wild rose. His heart is pounding so wildly he cannot fit the ignition key into the lock. When it does click in, the motor grinds for a few revolutions before catching, overheated from waiting in the sun. The female voice calling "Hey" so lightly hangs in his inner ear as the motor settles to its purr and he listens for pursuing shouts and even the sound of a rifle. These farmers all have guns and think nothing of using them, the years he worked as a typesetter for the Vat hardly a week went by without some rural murder all mixed in with sex and booze and incest.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> But the haze of the country around Galilee hangs silent above the sound of his engine. He wonders if his figure had been distinct enough to be recognized, by Ruth who hadn't seen him since he'd put on all this weight or by the daughter who has seen him once, a month ago. They report this to the police and use his name it'll get back to Janice and she'll raise hell to hear he's been snooping after this girl. Won't wash so good at Rotary either. Back. He must get back. Afraid of getting lost the other way, he dares back around and head back the way he came, past the mailboxes. He decides the mailbox that goes with the farm he spied on down in its little tousled valley with the duck pond is the blue one saying BYER. Fresh sky blue, painted this summer, with a decal flower, the sort of decoration a young woman might apply.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Byer. Ruth Byer. His daughter's first name Jamie Nunemacher never pronounced, that Rabbit can recall.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He asks Nelson one night, "Where's Melanie? I thought she was working days this week."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She is. She's gone out with somebody."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Really? You mean on a date?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The Phillies have been rained out tonight and while Janice and her mother are upstairs watching a Waltons rerun he and the kid find themselves in the living room, Harry leafing through the August Consumer Reports that has just come ("Are hair dyes safe?" "Road tests: 6 pickup trucks" "An alternative to the $2000 funeral") while the boy is looking into a copy of a book he has stolen from Fred Springer's old office at the lot, which has become Harry's. He doesn't look up. "You could call it a date. She just said she was going out."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "But with somebody."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Sure."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's O.K. with you? Her going out with somebody?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Sure. Dad, I'm trying to read."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The same rain that has postponed the Phils against the Pirates at Three Rivers Stadium has swept east across the Commonwealth and beats on the windows here at 89 Joseph Street, into the lowspreading branches of the copper beech that is the pride of the grounds, and at times thunderously upon the roof and spouting of the front porch roof. "Lemme see the book," Harry begs, and from within the Barcalounger holds out a long arm. Nelson irritably tosses over the volume, a squat green handbook on automobile dealership written by some crony of old man Springer's who had an agency in Paoli. Harry has looked into it once or twice: mostly hot air, hotshot stuff geared to the greater volume you can expect in the Philly area. "This tells you," he tells Nelson, "more than you need to know."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'm trying to understand," Nelson says, "about the financing."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's very simple. The bank owns the new cars, the dealer owns the used cars. The bank pays Mid?Atlantic Toyota when the car leaves Maryland; also there's something called holdback that the manufacturer keeps in case the dealer defaults on parts purchases, but that he rebates annually, and that to be frank about it has the effect of reducing the dealer's apparent profit in case he gets one of these wiseass customers who takes a great interest in the numbers and figures he can jew you down. Toyota insists we sell everything at their list so there's not much room for finagling, and that saves you a lot of headaches in my opinion. If they don't like the price they can come back a month later and find it three hundred bucks higher, the way the yen is going. Another wrinkle about financing, though, is when the customer takes out his loan where we send him ? Brewer Trust generally, and though this magazine right here had an article just last month about how you ought to shop around for loans instead of going where the agency recommends it's a hell of a hassle actually to buck the system, just to save maybe a half of a per cent ? the bank keeps back a percentage for our account, supposedly to cover the losses of selling repossessed vehicles, but in fact it amounts to a kickback. Follow me? Why do you care?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Just interested."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You should have been interested when your granddad Springer was around to be talked to. He ate this crap up. By the time he had sold a car to a customer the poor bozo thought he was robbing old Fred blind when the fact is the deal had angles to it like a spider web. When he wanted Toyota to give him the franchise, he claimed sixty thousand feet of extra service space that was just a patch of weeds, and then got a contractor who owed him a favor to throw down a slab and put up an uninsulated shell. That shop is still impossible to heat in the winter, you should hear 'Manny bitch."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson asks, "Did they used to ever chop the clock?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Where'd you learn that phrase?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "From the book."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well. ..." This isn't so bad, Harry thinks, talking to the kid sensibly while the rain drums down. He doesn't know why it makes him nervous to see the kid read. Like he's plotting something. They say you should encourage it, reading, but they never say why. "You know chopping the clock is a felony. But maybe in the old days sometimes a mechanic, up in the dashboard anyway, kind of had his screwdriver slip on the odometer. People who buy a used car know it's a gamble anyway. A car might go twenty thousand miles without trouble or pop a cylinder tomorrow. Who's to say? I've seen some amazing wear on cars that were running like new. Those VW bugs, you couldn't kill 'em. The body so rotten with rust the driver can see the road under his feet but the engine still ticking away." He tosses the chunky green book back. Nelson fumbles the catch. Harry asks him, "How do you feel, about your girlfriend's going out with somebody else?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I've told you before, Dad, she's not my girlfriend, she's my friend. Can't you have a friend of the opposite sex?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You can try it. How come she settled on moving back here with you then?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson's patience is being tried but Harry figures he might as wéll keep pushing, he's not learning anything playing the silent game. Nelson says, "She needed to blow the scene in Colorado and I was coming east and told her my grandmother's house had a lot of empty rooms. She's not been any trouble, has she?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No, she's charmed old Bessie right out of her sneakers. What was the matter with the scene in Colorado, that she needed to blow it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, you know. The wrong guy was putting a move on her, and she wanted to get her head together."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The rain restates its theme, hard, against the thin windows. Rabbit has always loved that feeling, of being inside when it rains. Shingles in the attic, pieces of glass no thicker than cardboard keeping him dry. Things that touch and yet not.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Delicately Harry asks, "You know the guy she's out with?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yes, Dad, and so do you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Billy Fosnacht?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Guess again. Think older. Think Greek."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh my God. You're kidding. That old crock?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson watches him with an alertness, a stillness of malice. He is not laughing, though the opportunity has been given. He explains, "He called up the Crépe House and asked her, and she thought Why not? It gets pretty boring around here, you have to admit. Just for a meal. She didn't promise to go to bed with him. The trouble with your generation, Dad, you can only think along certain lines."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Charlie Stavros," Harry says, trying to get a handle on it. The kid seems in a pretty open mood. Rabbit dares go on, "You remember he saw your mother for a while."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I remember. But everybody else around here seems to have forgotten. You all seem so cozy now."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Times change. You don't think we should be? Cozy."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson sneers, sinking lower into the depths of the old sofa. "I don't give that much of a damn. It's not my life."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It was," Harry says. "You were right there. I felt sorry for you, Nelson, but I couldn't think what else to do. That poor girl Jill -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Dad -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Skeeter's dead, you know. Killed in a Philadelphia shootout. Somebody sent me a clipping."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Mom wrote me that. I'm not surprised. He was crazy."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah, and then not. You know he said he'd be dead in ten years. He really did have a certain -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Dad. Let's cool this conversation."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "O.K. Suits me. Sure.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rain. So sweet, so solid. In the garden the smallest scabs of earth, beneath the lettuce and lopsided bean leaves perforated by Japanese beetles, are darkening, soaking, the leaves above them glistening, dripping, in the widespread vegetable sharing of this secret of the rain. Rabbit returns his eyes to his magazine from studying Nelson's stubborn clouded face. The best type of fourslice toaster, he reads, is the one that has separate controls for each pair of toast slots. Stavros and Melanie, can you believe? Charlie had kept saying he had liked her style.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> As if in apology for having cut his father off when the rain was making him reminiscent, Nelson breaks the silence. "What's Charlie's title over there, anyway?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Senior Sales Rep. He's in charge of the used cars and I take care of the new. That's more or less. In practice, we overlap. Along with Jake and Rudy, of course." He wants to keep reminding the kid of Jake and Rudy. No rich men's sons, they give a good day's work for their dollar.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Are you satisfied with the job Charlie does for you?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Absolutely. He knows the ropes better than I do. He knows half the county."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah, but his health. How much energy you think he has?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The question has a certain collegiate tilt to it. He hasn't asked Nelson enough about college, maybe that's the way through to him. All these women around, it's too easy for Nelson to hide. "Energy? He has to watch himself and take it easy, but he gets the job done. People don't like to be hustled these days, there was too much of that, the way the car business used to be. I think a salesman who's a little ? what's the word? ? laid back, people trust more. I don't mind Charlie's style." He wonders if Melanie does. Where are they, in some restaurant? He pictures her face, brighteyed almost like a thyroid bulge and her cheeks that look always rouged, rosy with exertion even before she bought the Fuji, her young face dense and smooth as she smiles and keeps smiling opposite old Charlie's classic con?man's profile, as he puts his move on her. And then later that business down below, his thick cock that blue?brown of Mediterranean types and, he wonders if her hair there is as curly as the hair on her head, in and out, he can't believe it will happen, while the rest of them sit here listening to the rain.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson is saying, "I was wondering if something couldn't be done with convertibles." A heavy shamed diffidence thickens his words so they seem to drop one by one from his face, downturned where he sits in the tired gray sofa with his muskrat cut.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Convertibles? How?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You know, Dad, don't make me say it. Buy 'em and sell 'em. Detroit doesn't make 'em anymore, so the old ones are more and more valuable. You could get more than you paid for Mom's Mustang."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "If you don't wreck it first."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> This reminder has the effect Rabbit wants. "Shit," the boy exclaims, defenseless, darting looks at every comer of the ceiling looking for the escape hatch, "I didn't wreck your damn precious Corona, I just gave it a little dent."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's still in the shop. Some dent."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I didn't do it on purpose, Christ, Dad, you act like it was some divine chariot or something. You've gotten so uptight in your old age."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Have I?" He asks sincerely, thinking this might be information.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yes. All you think about is money and things."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's not good, is it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You're right. Let's forget about the car. Tell me about college." "It's yukky," is the prompt response. "It's Dullsville. People think because of that shooting ten years ago it's some great radical place but the fact is most of the kids are Ohio locals whose idea of a terrific time is drinking beer till they throw up and having shaving cream fights in the dorms. Most of 'em are going to go into their father's business anyway, they don't care."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry ignores this, asking, "You ever have reason to go over to the big Firestone plant? I keep reading in the paper where they kept making those steel?belted radial five hundreds even after they kept blowing up on everybody."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Typical," the boy tells him. "All the products you buy are like that. All the American products."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "We used to be the best," Harry says, staring into the distance as if toward a land where he and Nelson can perfectly agree.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "So I'm told." The boy looks downward into his book.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nelson, about work. I told your mother we'd make a summer job for you over there on wash?up and maintenance. You'd learn a lot, just watching Manny and the boys."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Dad, I'm too old for wash?up. And maybe I need more than a summer job."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Are you trying to tell me you'd drop out of college with one lousy year to go?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> His voice has grown loud and the boy looks alarmed. He stares at his father open?mouthed, the dark ajar spot making with his two eyesockets three holes, in a hollow face. The rain drums on the porch roof spout. Janice and her mother come down from The Waltons weeping. Janice wipes at her eyes with her fingers and laughs. "It's so stupid, to get carried away. It was in People how all the actors couldn't stand each other, that's what broke up the show."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well, they have lots of reruns," Ma Springer says, dropping onto the gray sofa beside Nelson, as if this little trip downstairs has been all her legs can bear. "I'd seen that one before, but still they get to you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry announces, "The kid here says he may not go back to Kent."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice had been about to walk into the kitchen for a touch of Campari but freezes, standing. She is wearing just her short seethrough nightie over underpants in the heat. "You knew that, Harry," she says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Red bikini underpants, he notices, that show through as dusty pink. At the height of the heat wave last week she got her hair cut in Brewer by a man Doris Kaufinann goes to. He exposed the back of her neck and gave her bangs; Harry isn't used to them yet, it's as if a strange woman was slouching around here nearly naked. He almost shouts, "The hell I did. After all the money we've put into his education?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well," Janice says, swinging so her body taps the nightie from within, "maybe he's got what he can out of it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't get all this. There's something fishy going on. The kid comes home with no explanation and his girlfriend goes out with Charlie Stavros while he sits here hinting to me I should can Charlie so I can hire him instead."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well," Ma Springer pronounces peacefully, "Nelson's of an age. Fred made space for you, Harry, and I know if he was here he'd make space for Nelson."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> In on the dining?room sideboard, dead Fred Springer listens to the rain, misty?eyed.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not at the top he wouldn't," Harry says. "Not to somebody who quits college a few lousy credits short of graduating."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well Harry," Ma Springer says, as calm and mellow as if the TV show had been a pipe of pot, "some would have said you weren't so promising when Fred took you on. More than one person advised him against it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Out in the country, under the ground, old Farmer Byer mourns his fleet of school buses, rotting in the rain.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I was a forty?year?old man who'd lost his job through no fault of his own. I sat and did Linotype as long as there was Linotype."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You worked at your father's trade," Janice tells him, "and that's what Nelson's asking to do."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Sure, sure," Harry shouts, "when he gets out of college if that's what he wants. Though frankly I'd hoped he'd want more. But what is the rush? What'd he come home for anyway? If I'd ever been so lucky at his age to get to a state like Colorado I'd sure as hell have stayed at least the summer."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Sexier than she can know, Janice drags on a cigarette. "Why don't you want your own son home?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He's too big to be home! What's he running from?" From the look on their faces he may have hit on something, he doesn't know what. He's not sure he wants to know what. In the silence that answers him he listens again to the downpour, an incessant presence at the edge of their lamplight domain, gentle, insistent, unstoppable, a million small missiles striking home and running in rivulets from the face of things. Skeeter, Jill, and the Kent State Four are out there somewhere, bone dry.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Forget it," Nelson says, standing up. "I don't want any job with this creep."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What's he so hostile for?" Harry beseeches the women. "All I've said was I don't see why we should fire Charlie so the kid can peddle convertibles. In time, sure. In 1980, even. Take over, young America. Eat me up. But one thing at a time, Jesus. There's tons of time."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Is there?" Janice asks strangely. She does know something. Cunts always know something.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He turns to her directly. "You. I'd think you'd be loyal to Charlie at least."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "More than to my own son?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'll tell you this. I'll tell you all this. If Charlie goes, I go." He ?struggles to stand, but the Barcalounger has a sticky grip.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hip, hip hooray," Nelson says, yanking his denim jacket from the clothes tree inside the front door and shrugging it on. He looks humpbacked and mean, a rat going out to be drowned.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Now he's going out to wreck the Mustang." Harry struggles to his feet and stands, taller than them all.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ma Springer slaps her knees with open palms. "Well this discussion has ruined my mood. I'm going to heat up water for a cup of tea, the damp has put the devil in my joints."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice says, "Harry, say goodnight to Nelson nicely."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He protests, "He hasn't said goodnight nicely to me. I was down here trying to talk nicely to him about college and it was like pulling teeth. What's everything such a secret for? I don't even know what he's majoring in now. First it was pre?med but the chemistry was too hard, then it was anthropology but there was too much to memorize, last I heard he'd switched to social science but it was too much bullshit."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'm majoring in geography," Nelson admits, nervous by the door, tense to scuttle.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Geography! That's something they teach in the third grade! I never heard of a grownup studying geography."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Apparently it's a great specialty out there," Janice says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Whadde they do all day, color maps?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Mom, I got to split. Where's your car keys?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Look in my raincoat pocket."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry can't stop getting after him. "Now remember the roads around here are slippery when wet," he says. "If you get lost just call up your geography professor."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Charlie's taking Melanie out really bugs you, doesn't it?" Nelson says to him.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not at all. What bugs me is why it doesn't bug you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'm queer," Nelson tells him.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> ` Janice, what have I done to this kid to deserve this?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She sighs. "Oh, I expect you know."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He is sick of these allusions to his tainted past. "I took care of him, didn't I? While you were off screwing around who was it put his breakfast cereal on the table and got him off to school?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "My daddy did," Nelson says in a bitter mincing voice.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice intervenes. "Nellie, why don't you go now if you're going to go? Did you find the keys?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The child dangles them.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You're committing automotive suicide," Rabbit tells her. "This kid is a car killer."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It was just a fucking dent," Nelson cries to the ceiling, "and he's going to make me suffer and suffer." The door slams, having admitted a sharp gust of the aroma of the rain.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Now who else would like some tea?" Ma Springer calls from the kitchen. They go in to her. Moving from the stuffy overfurnished living room to the kitchen with its clean enamelled surfaces provides a brighter perspective on the world. "Harry, you shouldn't be so hard on the boy," his mother?in?law advises. "He has a lot on his mind."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Like what?" he asks sharply.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh," Ma says, still mellow, setting out plates of comfort, Walton?style, "the things young people do."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice has on underpants beneath her nightie but no bra and in the bright light her nipples show inside the cloth with their own pink color, darker, more toward wine. She is saying, "It's a hard age. They seem to have so many choices and yet they don't. They've been taught by television all their lives to want this and that and yet when they get to be twenty they find money isn't so easy to come by after all. They don't have the opportunities even we had."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> This doesn't sound like her. "Who have you been talking to?" Harry asks scornfully.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice is harder to put down than formerly; she tidies her bangs with a fiddling raking motion of her fingers and answers, "Some of the girls at the club, their children have come home too and don't know what to do with themselves. It even has a name now, the back?to?the?nest something."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Syndrome," he says; he is being brought round. He and Pop and Mom sometimes after Mim had been put to bed would settle like this around the kitchen table, with cereal or cocoa if not tea. He feels safe enough to sound plaintive. "If he'd just ask for help," he says, "I'd try to give it. But he doesn't ask. He wants to take without asking."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And isn't that just human nature," Ma Springer says, in a ?spruced?up voice. The tea tastes to her satisfaction and she adds as if to conclude, "There's a lot of sweetness in Nelson, I think he's just a little overwhelmed for now."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Who isn't?" Harry asks.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> In bed, perhaps it's the rain that sexes him up, he insists they make love, though at first Janice is reluctant. "I would have taken a bath," she says, but she smells great, deep jungle smell, of precious rotting mulch going down and down beneath the ferns. When he won't stop, crazy to lose his face in this essence, the cool stem fury of it takes hold of her and combatively she comes, thrusting her hips up to grind her clitoris against his face and then letting him finish inside her beneath him. Lying spent and adrift he listens again to the rain's sound, which now and then quickens to a metallic rhythm on the window glass, quicker than the throbbing in the iron gutter, where ropes of water twist.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I like having Nelson in the house," Harry says to his wife. "It's great to have an enemy. Sharpens your senses."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Murmurously beyond their windows, yet so close they might be in the cloud of it, the beech accepts, leaf upon leaf, shelves and stairs of continuous dripping, the rain.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nelson's not your enemy. He's your boy and needs you more now than ever though he can't say it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rain, the last proof left to him that God exists. "I feel," he says, "there's something I don't know."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice admits, "There is."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What is it?" Receiving no answer, he asks then, "How do you know it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Mother and Melanie talk."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How bad is it? Drugs?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh Harry no." She has to hug him, his ignorance must make him seem so vulnerable. "Nothing like that. Nelson's like you are, underneath. He likes to keep himself pure."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Then what the fuck's up? Why can't I be told?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She hugs him again, and lightly laughs. "Because you're not a Springer."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Long after she has fallen into the steady soft rasping of sleep he lies awake listening to the rain, not willing to let it go, this sound of life. You don't have to be a Springer to have secrets. Blue eyes so pale in the light coming into the back seat of that Corolla. Janice's taste is still on his lips and he thinks maybe it wouldn't be such a good idea for Sealtest. Twice as he lies awake a car stops outside and the front door opens: the first time from the quietness of the motor and the lightness of the steps on the porch boards, Stavros dropping off Melanie; the next time, not many minutes later, the motor brutally raced before cut?off and the footsteps loud and defiant, must be Nelson, having had more beers than was good for him. From the acoustical quality surrounding the sounds of this second car Rabbit gathers that the rain is letting up. He listens for the young footsteps to come upstairs but one set seems to trap the other in the kitchen, Melanie having a snack. The thing about vegetarians, they seem always hungry. You eat and eat and it's never the right food. Who told him that, once? Tothero, he seemed so old there at the end but how much older than Harry is now was he? Nelson and Melanie stay in the kitchen talking until the eavesdropper wearies and surrenders. In his dream, Harry is screaming at the boy over the telephone at the lot, but though his mouth is open so wide he can see all his own teeth spread open like in those dental charts they marked your cavities on that looked like a scream, no sound comes out; his jaws and eyes feel frozen open and when he awakes it seems it has been the morning sun, pouring in hungrily after the rain, that he has been aping.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The display windows at Springer Motors have been recently washed and Harry stands staring through them with not a fleck of dust to show him he is not standing outdoors, in an air-conditioned outdoors, the world left rinsed and puddled by last night's rain, with yet a touch of weariness in the green of the tree across Route 111 behind the Chuck Wagon, a dead or yellow leaf here and there, at the tips of the crowded branches that are dying. The traffic this weekday flourishes. Carter keeps talking about a windfall tax on the oil companies' enormous profits but that won't happen, Harry feels. Carter is smart as a whip and prays a great deal but his gift seems to be the old Eisenhower one of keeping much from happening, just a little daily seepage.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Charlie is with a young black couple wrapping up the sale of a trade?in, unloading a '73 Buick eight?cylinder two?tone for three K on good folks too far behind in the rat race to know times have changed, we're running out of gas, the smart money is into for-eign imports with sewing?machine motors. They even got dressed up for the occasion, the wife wears a lavender suit with the skirt old?fashionedly short, her calves hard and high up on her skinny bow legs. They really aren't shaped like we are; Skeeter used to say they were the latest design. Her ass is high and hard along the same lines as her calves as she revolves gleefully around the garish old Buick, in the drench of sunshine, on the asphalt still wet and gleaming. A pretty sight, out of the past. Still it does not dispel the sour unease in Harry's stomach after his short night's sleep. Charlie says something that doubles them both up laughing and then they drive the clunker off. Charlie comes back to his desk in a corner of the cool showroom and Harry approaches him there.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How'd you dig Melanie last night?" He tries to keep the smirk out of his voice.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nice girl." Charlie keeps his pencil moving. "Very straight."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry's voice rises indignantly. "What's straight about her? She's kooky as a bluebird, for all I can see."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not so, champ. Very level head. She's one of those women you worry about, that they see it all so clearly they'll never let themselves go."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You're telling me she didn't let herself go with you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I didn't expect her to. At my age ? who needs it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You're younger than I am."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not at heart. You're still learning."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> It is as when he was a boy in grade school, and there seemed to be a secret everywhere, flickering up and down the aisles, bouncing around like the playground ball at recess, and he could not get his hands on it, the girls were keeping it from him, they were too quick. "She mention Nelson?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "A fair amount."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Whatcha think is going on between them?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I think they're just buddies."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You don't think anymore they got to be fucking?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Charlie gives up, slapping his desk and pushing back from his paperwork. "Hell, I don't know how these kids have it organized. In our day if you weren't fucking you'd move on. With them it may be different. They don't want to be killers like we were. If they are fucking, from the way she talks about him it has about the charge of cuddling a teddy bear before you go to sleep."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She sees him that way, huh? Childish."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Vulnerable is the way she'd put it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry offers, "There's some piece missing here. Janice was dropping hints last night."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Stavros delicately shrugs. "Maybe it's back in Colorado. The piece."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Did she say anything specific?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Stavros ponders before answering, pushing up his amber glasses with a forefinger and then resting that finger on the bridge of his nose. "No."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry tries outright grievance. "I can't figure out what the kid wants."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He wants to get started at the real world. I think he wants in around here."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I know he wants in, and I don't want him in. He makes me uncomfortable. With that sorehead look of his he couldn't sell -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Coke in the Sahara," Charlie finishes for him. "Be that as it may, he's Fred Springer's grandson. He's engonaki."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah, both Janice and Bessie are pushing, you saw that the other night. They're driving me wild. We have a nice symmetrical arrangement here, and how many cars'd we move in July?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Stavros checks a sheet of paper under his elbow. "Twentynine, would you believe. Thirteen used, sixteen new. Including three of those Celica GTs for ten grand each. I didn't think it would go, not against all the little sports coming out of Detroit at half the price. Those Nips, they know their market research."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "So to hell with Nelson. There's only one month left in the summer anyway. Why screw Jake and Rudy out of sales commission just to accommodate a kid too spoiled to take a job in the shop? He wouldn't even have had to dirty his hands, we could have put him in Parts."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Stavros says, "You could put him on straight salary here on the floor. I'd take him under my wing."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Charlie doesn't seem to realize he is the one to get pushed out. You try to defend somebody and he undermines you while you're doing it. But Charlie sees the problem after all; he expresses it: "Look. You're the son?in?law, you can't be touched. But me, the old lady is my connection here, and it's sentimental at that, she likes me because I remind her of Fred, of the old days. Sentiment doesn't beat out blood. I'm in no position to hang tough. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Furthermore I think I can talk to the kid, do something for him. Don't worry, he'll never stick in this business, he's too twitchy. He's too much like his old man."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I see no resemblance," Harry says, though pleased.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You wouldn't. I don't know, it seems to be hard these days, being a father. When I was a kid it seemed simple. Tell the kid what to do and if he doesn't do it sock him one. Here's my thought. When you and Jan and the old lady are taking your weeks in the Poconos, has Nelson been planning to come along?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "They've asked him, but he didn't seem too enthusiastic. As a kid he was always lonely up there. Jesus, it'd be hell, in that little space. Even around the house every time you come into a room it seems he's sitting there with a beer."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Right. Well how about buying him a suit and tie and letting him come in here? Give him the minimum wage, no commission and no draw. He wouldn't be getting on your nerves, or you on his."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How could I be getting on his nerves? He walks all over me. He takes the car all the time and tries to make me feel guilty besides."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Charlie doesn't dignify this with an answer; he knows too much of the story.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry admits, "Well, it's an idea. Then he'd be going back to college?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Charlie shrugs. "Let's hope. Maybe you can make that part of the bargain."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Looking down upon the top of Charlie's fragile wavy?haired skull, Rabbit cannot avoid awareness of his own belly, an extensive; suit?straining slope; he has become a person and a half, where the same years have pared Charlie's shape, once stocky, bit by bit. He asks him, "You really want to do this for Nelson?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I like the kid. To me, he's just another basket case. At his age now they're all basket cases."
<br>

<br> 
<br> A couple has parked out in the glare and is heading for the showroom doors, a well?dressed Penn Park sort of pair that will probably collect the literature and sneak off to buy a Mercedes, as an investment. "Well, it's your funeral," Harry tells Charlie. Actually it might be nice all around. Melanie wouldn't be left alone in that big house all by herself. And it occurs to him that this all may be Melanie's idea, and Charlie's way of keeping his move on her alive.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> In bed Melanie asks Nelson, "What are you learning?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, stuff." They have decided upon her bed in the front room for these weeks when the old people are in the Poconos. Melanie in the month and more of her tenancy here has gradually moved the headless dress dummy to a comer and hidden some of the Springers' other ugly possessions ? slid some rolled?up hall carpeting beneath the bed, tucked a trunkful of old curtains and a broken foot?pedalled Singer into the back of the closet, already crammed with outgrown and outmoded clothes in polyethylene cleaner bags. She has Scotch?taped a few Peter Max posters to the walls and made the room her own. They have used Nelson's room up to now, but his childhood bed is single and in truth he feels inhibited there. They had not intended to sleep together at all in this house but out of their long and necessary conversations it had been inevitable they sink into it. Melanie's breasts are indeed, as Charlie had noticed at a glance, large; their laden warm sway sometimes sickens Nelson, reminding him of a more shallowbreasted other, whom he has abandoned. He elaborates: "Lots of things. There's all these pressures that don't show, like between the agency and the manufacturer. You got to buy sets of their special tools, for thousands of dollars, and they keep loading their base models with what used to be extras, where the dealer used to make a lot of his profit. Charlie told me a radio used to cost the dealer about thirty?five dollars and he'd add about one?eighty on to the sales price. See then by the manufacturer getting greedy and taking these options away from the dealer the dealers have to think up more gimmicks. Like undercoating. And rustproofing. There's even a treatment they'll give the vinyl upholstery to keep it from wearing supposedly. All that stuff. It's all cutthroat but kind ofjolly at the same time, all these little pep talks people keep giving each other. My grandfather used to have a performance board but Dad's let it drop. You can tell Charlie thinks Dad's really lazy and sloppy the way he runs things."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She pushes herself more upright in the bed, her breasts sluggish and luminous in the half?light the maples filter from the sodium lamps on Joseph Street. There is that something heavy and maternal and mystical in her he cannot escape. "Charlie's asked me out on another date," she says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Go," Nelson advises, enjoying the altered feeling of the bed, Melanie's lifting her torso above him deepening the rumpled trough in which he lies. When he was a little child and Mom and Dad were living in that apartment high on Wilbur Street and they would come visit here he would be put to bed in this very room, his grandmother's hair all black then but the patterns of light carved on the ceiling by the window mullions just the same as they are now. Mom?mom would sing him songs, he remembers, but he can't remember what they were. In Pennsylvania Dutch, some of them. Reide, reide, Geile . . . .
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Melanie pulls a hairpin from the back of her head and fishes with it in the ashtray for a dead roach that may have a hit or two left in it. She holds it to her red lips and lights it; the paper flares. When she lifted her arm to pull the hairpin, the hair in her armpit, unshaved, has flared in Nelson's field of vision. Despite himself, to no purpose, his prick with little knocks of blood begins to harden down in the trough of childish warmth. "I don't know," Melanie says. "I think with them away, he's psyched to score."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How do you feel about that?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not so great."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He's a pretty nice guy," Nelson says, snuggling deeper beside her abstracted body, enjoying the furtive growth of his erection. "Even if he did screw Mom."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Suppose it kills him, how would I feel then? I mean, one of the reasons for my coming with you was to clean my head of all this father?figure shit."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You came along because Pru told you to." Saying the other's name is delicious, a cool stab in the warmth. "So I wouldn't get away."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well, yeah, but I wouldn't have if I hadn't had reasons of my own. I'm glad I came. I like it here. It's like America used to be. All these brick houses built so solid, one against the other."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I hate it. Everything's so humid and stuffy and, so closed."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You really feel that Nelson?" He likes it when she kind of purrs his name. "I thought you acted frightened, in Colorado. There was too much space. Or maybe it was the situation."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson loses Colorado in awareness of his erection, like a piece of round?ended ridged ivory down there, and of the womanly thick cords in her throat swelling as she sucks one last hit from the tiny butt held tight against her painted lips. Melanie always wears makeup, lipstick and touches of red to her cheeks to make her complexion less olive, where Pru never wore any, her lips pale as her brow, and everything about her face precise and dry as a photograph. Pru: the thought of her is a gnawing in his stomach, like somebody rolling a marble around over grits of sand. He says, "Maybe what I mind about around here is Dad." At the thought of Dad the abrasion intensifies. "I can't stand him, the way he sits there in the living room hogging the Barcalounger. He" ? he can hardly find words, the discomfort is so great ? "just sits there in the middle of the whole fucking world, taking and taking. He doesn't know anything the way Charlie does. What did he ever do, to build up the lot? My granddad was grubbing his way up while my father wasn't doing anything but being a lousy husband to my mother. That's all he's done to deserve all this money: be too lazy and shiftless to leave my mother like he wanted to. I think he's queer. You should have seen him with this black guy I told you about."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You loved your granddad, didn't you Nelson?" When she's high on pot her voice gets husky and kind of trancy, like one of these oracles sitting over her tripod they talked about in anthro at Kent. Kent: more sand rubbing in his stomach.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He liked me," Nelson insists, writhing a little and noticing with his hand that his erection has slightly wilted, possessing no longer the purity of ivory but the compromised texture of flesh and blood. "He wasn't always criticizing me because I wasn't some great shakes athlete and ten feet tall."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I've never heard your father criticize you," she says, "except when you cracked up his car."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Goddam it I didn't crack it up, I just dented the bastard and he's going through this whole big deal, weeks in the body shop while I'm supposed to feel guilty or inept or something. And there was an animal in the road, some little thing I don't know what it was, a woodchuck, I would have seen the stripes if it had been a skunk, I don't know why they don't make these dumb animals with longer legs, it waddled. Right into the headlights. I wish I'd killed it. I wish I'd smashed up all Dad's cars, the whole fucking inventory."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "This is really crazy talk Nelson," Melanie says from within her amiable trance. "You need your father. We all need fathers. At least yours is where you can find him. He's not a bad man."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He is bad, really bad. He doesn't know what's up, and he doesn't care, and he thinks he's so great. That's what gets me, his happiness. He is so fucking happy." Nelson almost sobs. "You think of all the misery he's caused. My little sister dead because of him and then this Jill he let die."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Melanie knows these stories. She says in a patient singsong, "You mustn't forget the circumstances. Your father's not God." Her hand follows down inside the bedsheet where his has been exploring. She smiles. Her teeth are perfect. She's had orthodontia, and poor Pru never did, her people were too poor, so she hates to smile, though the irregularity isn't really that noticeable, just a dog tooth slightly overlapping on one side. "You're feeling frustrated right now," Melanie tells him, "because of your situation. But your situation is not your father's fault."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It is," Nelson insists. "Everything's his fault, it's his fault I'm so fucked up, and he enjoys it, the way he looks at me sometimes, you can tell he's really eating it up, that I'm fucked up. And then the way Mom waits on him, like he's actually done something for her, instead of the other way around."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Come on Nelson, let it go," Melanie croons. "Forget everything for now. I'll help you." She flips down the sheet and turns her back. "Here's my ass. I love being fucked from behind when I have a buzz on. It's like I'm occupying two planes of being."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Melanie hardly ever tries to come when they make love, takes it for granted she is serving the baby male and not herself. With Pru, though, the woman was always trying, breathing "Wait" in his ear and squirming around with her pelvis for the right contact, and even when he couldn't wait and failed, this was somehow more flattering. Remembering Pru this way he feels the nibble of guilt in the depths of his stomach take a sharper bite, like the moment in Jaws when the girl gets pulled under.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;

<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Water. Rabbit distrusts the element though the little brown hourglass?shaped lake that laps the gritty beach in front of the Springers' old cottage in the Poconos seems friendly and tame, and he swims in it every day, taking a dip before breakfast, before Janice is awake, and while Ma Springer in her quilty bathrobe fusses at the old oil stove to make the morning coffee. On weekdays when there aren't so many people around he walks down across the coarse imported sand wrapped in a beach towel and, after a glance right and left at the cottages that flank theirs back in the pines, slips into the lake naked. What luxury! A chill silver embrace down and through his groin. Gnats circling near the surface shatter and reassemble as he splashes through them, cleaving the plane of liquid stillness, sending ripples right and left toward muddy rooty banks city blocks away. A film of mist sits visible on the skin of the lake if the hour is early enough. He was never an early?to?rise freak but sees the point of it now, you get into the day at the start, before it gets rolling, and roll with it. The film of mist tastes of evening chill, of unpolluted freshness in a world waking with him. As a kid Rabbit never went to summer camps, maybe Nelson is right they were too poor, it never occurred to them. The hot cracked sidewalks and dusty playground of Mt. Judge were summer enough, and the few trips to the Jersey Shore his parents organized stick up in his remembrance as almost torture, the hours on poky roads in the old Model A and then the mudbrown Chevy, his sister and mother adding to the heat the vapors of female exasperation, Pop dogged at the wheel, the back of his neck sweaty and scrawny and freckled while the flat little towns of New Jersey threw back at Harry distorted echoes of his own town, his own life, for which he was homesick after an hour. Town after town numbingly demonstrated to him that his life was a paltry thing, roughly duplicated by the millions in settings where houses and porches and trees mocking those in Mt. Judge fed the illusions of other little boys that their souls were central and important and invisibly cherished. He would look at the little girls on the sidewalks they drove alongside wondering which of them he would marry, for his idea of destiny was to move away and marry a girl from another town. The traffic as they neared the Shore became thicker, savage, metropolitan. Cars, he has always found cars, their glitter, their exhalations, cruel. Then at last arriving in a burst of indignities ? the parking lot full, the bathhouse attendant rude ? they would enter upon a few stilted hours on the alien beach whose dry sand burned the feet and scratched in the crotch and whose wet ribs where the sea had receded had a deadly bottomless smell, a smell of vast death. Every found shell had this frightening faint stink. His parents in bathing suits alarmed him. His mother didn't look obscenely fat like some of the other mothers but bony and long and hard, and as she stood to call him or little Mim back from the suspect crowds of strangers or the dangerous rumor of undertow her arms seemed to be flapping like featherless wings. Not Rabbit then, he would be called as "Hassy! Hassy!" And his father's skin where the workclothes always covered it seemed so tenderly white. He loved his father for having such whiteness upon him, secretly, a kind of treasure; in the bathhouse he and Pop changed together rapidly, not looking at one another, and at the end of the day changed again. The ride back to Diamond County was always long enough for the sunburn to start hurting. He and Mim would start slapping each other just to hear the other yell and to relieve the boredom of this wasted day that could have been spent among the fertile intrigues and perfected connections of the Mt. Judge playground.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> In his memory of these outings they always seem to be climbing toward the ocean as toward a huge blue mountain. Sometimes at night before falling to sleep he hears his mother say with a hiss, "Hassy." He sees now that he is rich that these were the outings of the poor, ending in sunburn and stomach upset. Pop liked crabcakes and baked oysters but could never eat them without throwing up. When the Model A was tucked into the garage and little Mim tucked into bed Harry could hear his father vomiting in a far corner of the yard. He never complained about vomiting or about work, they were just things you had to do, one more regularly than the other.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> So as a stranger to summer places Rabbit had come to this cottage Fred Springer had bought rather late in his life, after the Toyota franchise had made him more than a used?car dealer, after his one child was married and grown. Harry and Janice used to come for just visits of a week. The space was too small, the tensions would begin to rub through, with Nelson bored and bugeaten after the first day or so. You can only go visit Bushkill Falls so often, climbing up and down those steps admiring the ferns.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> When old man Springer died Harry became the man of the place and at last understood that Nature isn't just something that pushes up through the sidewalk cracks and keeps the farmers trapped in the sticks but is an elixir, a luxury that can be bought and fenced off and kept pure for the more fortunate, in an impure age. Not that this five?room, dark?shingled cottage, which Ma Springer rents for all but these three weeks of August, taking the Labor Day gravy and renting into hunting season if she can, was in any league with the gabled estates and lodges and resort hotels that are all around them tumbling down or being broken up by developers; but it has two acres ofwoods behind it and a dock and rowboat of its own, and holds out to Harry the possibility that life can be lived selectively, as one chooses from a menu, or picks a polished fruit from a bowl. Here in the Poconos food, exercise, and sleep, no longer squeezed into the margins of the day, swell to a sumptuous importance. The smell of fresh coffee drifting to greet him as he walks still wet back from his swim; the kiss of morning fog through a rusted window screen; the sight of Janice with bare brown feet wearing the same tennis shorts and kid's black T?shirt day after day; the blue jay switching stances on the porch rail; the smooth rose?veined rock holding shut the upstairs door that has lost its latch; the very texture of root?riddled mud and reeds where the fresh cedar dock pilings have been driven: he feels love for each phenomenon and not for the first time in his life seeks to bring himself into harmony with the intertwining simplicities that uphold him, that were woven into him at birth. There must be a good way to live.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He eases off on the gin and snacks. He swims and listens to Ma Springer reminisce over the morning coffee and goes down into the village with Janice each day to shop. At night they play threehanded pinochle by the harsh light of bridge lamps, the light feeling harsh because when he had first come to this place they lit kerosene lamps, with fragile interior cones of glowing ash, and went to bed soon after dark, the crickets throbbing. He does not like to fish, nor does he much like playing tennis with Janice against one of the other couples that have access to the lake community's shared court, an old rectangle of clay in the pines, the edges coated with brown needles and the chicken?wire fencing drooping like wet wash. Janice plays every day at the Flying Eagle, and beside her efficient grace he feels cumbersome and out of it. The ball hops at him with a speed his racket cannot match. Her black T?shirt has on it in faded 3?D script the word Phillies; it is a shirt he bought Nelson on one of their excursions to Veterans Stadium, and the boy left it behind when he went away to Kent, and Janice in her middle?aged friskiness found it and made it hers. Typical of the way things have gone, that the kid's growing up should seem a threat and a tragedy to him and to her an excuse to steal a T?shirt. Not that it would fit Nelson anymore. It fits her fine; he feels her beside him in the corner of his eye nimbler and freer than he in her swarthy thick?middled old girl's shape with her short hair and bouncing bangs. The ball arcs back steadily from her racket while he hits it too hard or else, trying to "stroke" it like she tells him, pops it weakly into the net. "Harry, don't try to steer it," she says. "Keep your knees bent. Point your hip toward the net." She has had a lot of lessons. The decade past has taught her more than it has taught him.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> What has he done, he wonders as he waits to receive the serve, with this life of his more than half over? He was a good boy to his mother and then a good boy to the crowds at the basketball games, a good boy to Tothero his old coach, who saw in Rabbit something special. And Ruth saw in him something special too, though she saw it winking out. For a while Harry had kicked against death, then he gave in and went to work. Now the dead are so many he feels for the living around him the camaraderie of survivors. He loves these people with him, penned in among the lines of the tennis court. Ed and Loretta: he's an electrical contractor from Easton specializing in computer installations. Harry loves the treetops above their heads, and the August blue above these. What does he know? He never reads a book, just the newspaper to have something to say to people, and then mostly human interest stories, like where the Shah is heading next and how sick he really is, and that Baltimore doctor. He loves Nature, though he can name almost nothing in it. Are these pines, or spruces, or firs? He loves money, though he doesn't understand how it flows to him, or how it leaks away. He loves men, uncomplaining with their pot bellies and cross?hatched red necks, embarrassed for what to talk about when the game is over, whatever the game is. What a threadbare thing we make of life! Yet what a marvellous thing the mind is, they can't make a machine like it, though some of these computers Ed was telling about fill rooms; and the body can do a thousand things there isn't a factory in the world can duplicate the motion. He used to love screwing, though more and more he's willing just to think about it and let the younger people mess with it, meeting in their bars and cars, amazing how many of them there are now, just walking down the street or getting into a movie line he often seems to be the oldest guy in sight. At night when he's with Janice, she needing a touch of cock to lead her into sleep, he tries to picture what will turn him on, and he's running out of pictures; the last that works is of a woman on all fours being fucked by one man while she blows another. And it's not clear in the picture if Harry is doing the fucking or is the man being blown, he is looking at all three from the outside, as if up on a screen at one of these movie theaters on upper Weiser with titles like Harem Girls and All the Way, and the woman's sensations seem nearer to him than the man's, the prick in your mouth like a small wet zucchini, plus the other elsewhere, in and out, in and out, a kind of penance at your root. Sometimes he prays a few words at night but a stony truce seems to prevail between himself and God.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He begins to run. In the woods, along the old logging roads and bridle trails, he ponderously speeds in tennis shoes first, orange with clay dust, and then in gold?and?blue Nikes bought at a sporting goods shop in Stroudsburg especially for this, running shoes with tipped?up soles at toe and heel, soles whose resilient circlets like flattened cleats lift him powerfully as, growing lighter and quicker and quieter, he runs. At first he feels his weight like some murderous burden swaddled about his heart and lungs and his thigh muscles ache in the morning so that he staggers in leaving the bed and laughs aloud in surprise. But as over the days, running after supper in the cool of the early evening while all the light has not ebbed from the woods, he accustoms his body to this new demand, his legs tighten, his weight seems less, his chest holds more air, the twigs fly past his ears as if winged on their own, and he extends the distance he jogs, eventually managing the mile and a half to the waist of the hourglass, where the gates of an old estate bar the way. Carbon Castle the locals call the estate, built by a coal baron from Scranton and now little utilized by his scattered and dwindled descendants, the swimming pool drained, the tennis courts overgrown, energy gone. The glass eyes of the stuffed deer heads in the hunting lodge stare through cobwebs; the great main house with its precipitous slate roofs and diamond?paned windows is boarded up, though ten years ago one of the grandsons tried to 'make of it a commune, the villagers say. The young people vandalized the place, the story runs, and sold off everything they could move, including the two bronze brontosaurs that guarded the main entrance, emblems of the Coal Age. The heavy iron gates to Carbon Castle are double?chained and padlocked; Rabbit touches the forbidding metal, takes a breath for a still second while the world feels still to be rushing on, pouring through the tremble of his legs, then turns and jogs back, casting his mind wide, so as to become unconscious of his heaving body. There is along the way an open space, once a meadow, now spiked with cedars and tassle?headed weeds, where swallows dip and careen, snapping up insects revived in the evening damp. Like these swallows Rabbit, the blue and gold of his new shoes flickering, skims, above the earth, above the dead. The dead stare upwards. Mom and Pop are lying together again as for so many years on that sway?backed bed they'd bought second?hand during the Depression and never got around to replacing though it squeaked like a tricycle left out in the rain and was so short Pop's feet stuck out of the covers. Paperywhite feet that got mottled and marbled with veins finally: if he'd ever have exercised he might have lived longer. Tothero down there is all eyes, eyes big as saucers staring out of his lopsided head while his swollen tongue hunts for a word. Fred Springer, who put Harry where he is, eggs him on, hunched over and grimacing like a man with a poker hand so good it hurts. Skeeter, who that newspaper clipping claimed had fired upon the Philly cops first even though there were twenty of them in the yard and hallways and only some pregnant mothers and children on the commune premises, Skeeter black as the earth turns his face away. The meadow ends and Harry enters a tunnel, getting dark now, the needles a carpet, he makes no sound, Indians moved without sound through trees without end where a single twig snapping meant death, his legs in his fatigue cannot be exactly controlled but flail against the cushioned path like arms of a loose machine whose gears and joints have been bevelled by wear. Becky, a mere seed laid to rest, and Jill, a pale seedling held from the sun, hang in the earth, he imagines, like stars, and beyond them there are myriads, whole races like the Cambodians, that have drifted into death. He is treading on them all, they are resilient, they are cheering him on, his lungs are burning, his heart hurts, he is a membrane removed from the hosts below, their filaments caress his ankles, he loves the earth, he will never make their mistake and die.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The last hundred feet, up their path to the tilting front porch, Rabbit sprints. He opens the front screen door and feels the punky floorboards bounce under him. The milk?glass shades of the old kerosene lamps, increasingly valuable as antiques, tremble, like the panes in the breakfront back on Joseph street. Janice emerges barefoot from the kitchen and says, "Harry, you're all red in the face."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'm. All. Right."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Sit down. For heaven's sakes. What are you training for?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "The big bout," he pants. "It feels great. To press against. Your own limitations."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You're pressing too hard ifyou ask me. Mother and I thought ?you got lost. We want to play pinochle."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I got to take. A shower. The trouble with running is. You get all sweaty."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I still don't know what you're trying to prove." With that Phillies shirt on she looks like Nelson, before he needed to shave.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's now or never," he tells her, the blood of fantasy rushing through his brain. "There's people out to get me. I can lie down now. Or fight."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Who's out to get you?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You should know. You hatched him."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The hot water here runs off a little electric unit and is scalding for a few minutes and then cools with lightning speed. Harry thinks, A good way to kill somebody would be to turn off the cold water while they're in the shower. He dances out before the hot expires totally, admires the wet prints of his big feet on the bare pine floors of this attic?shaped upstairs, and thinks of his daughter, her feet in those cork?soled platforms. With her leggy pallor and calm round face she glows like a ghost but unlike the dead shares the skin of this planet with him, breathes air, immerses herself in water, moves from element to element, and grows. He goes into the bedroom he and Janice have here and dresses himself in Jockey shorts, an alligator shirt, and soft Levis all washed and tumble?dried at the laundromat behind the little Acme in the village. Each crisp item seems another tile of his well?being he is fitting into place. As he sits on the bed to put on fresh socks a red ray of late sun slices through a gap in the pines and falls knifelike across his toes, the orangish corns and the little hairs between the joints and the nails translucent like the thin sheets in furnace peepholes. There are feet that have done worse than his, on a lot ofwomen's in summer sandals you notice how the little toes have been bent under by years of pointy high?heeled shoes, and the big toes pushed over so the joint sticks out like a broken bone; thank God since he is a man that has never had to happen to him. Nor to Cindy Murkett either, come to think of it: toes side by side like candies in a box. Suck. That lucky stiff Webb. Still. It's good to be alive. Harry goes downstairs and adds the fourth element to his happiness; he lights a fire. Ma Springer, riding shrewdly with the times, has bought a new wood stove. Its bright black flue pipe fits snugly into the smudged old fireplace of ugly fieldstones. Old man Springer had installed baseboard electric heat when the cottage was connected for electricity, but his widow begrudges the expense of turning it on, even though by August the nights bring in a chill from the lake. The stove comes from Taiwan and is clean as a skillet, installed just this summer. Harry lays some rough sticks found around the cottage on top of a crumpled Sports page from the Philadelphia Bulletin and watches them catch, watches the words EAGLES READY ignite and blacken, the letters turning white on the crinkling ash; then he adds some crescentshaped scraps of planed fruitwood a local furniture?maker sells by the bushel outside his factory. This fire greets the dark as Janice and her mother, the dishes done, come in and get out the pinochle deck.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> As she deals, Ma Springer says, the words parcelled out in rhythm with the cards, ` "Janice and I were saying, really we don't think it's so wise, for you to be running like this, at your age."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "My age is the age to do it. Now's the time to start taking care of myself, I've had a free ride up to now."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Mother says you should have your heart checked first," Janice says. She has put on a sweater and jeans but her feet are still bare. He glances at them under the card table. Pretty straight, the toes are. Not too much damage, considering. Bony and brown and boyish. He likes it, that up here in the Poconos she looks so often like a boy. His playmate. As when a child he would stay over at a playmate's house.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Your father, you know," Ma Springer is telling him, "was taken off by his heart."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He'd been suffering for years," Harry says, "with a lot of things. He was seventy. He was ready to go."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You may not think so when your time comes."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I've been thinking about all the dead people I know lately," Harry says, looking at his cards. Ace, ten, king, and jack of spades, but no queen. No pinochle either therefore. No runs. No four of anything. A raft of low clubs. "I pass."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Pass," Janice says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'll take it at twenty?one," Ma Springer sighs, and lays down a run in diamonds, and the nine, and a queen of spades to go with the jack.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Wow," Harry tells her. "What power."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Which dead, Harry?" Janice asks.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She is afraid he means Becky. But he really rarely thinks of their dead infant, and then pleasantly, as of a brief winter day's sun on last night's snowfall, though her name was June. "Oh, Pop and Mom mostly. Wondering if they're watching. You do so much to get your parents' attention for so much of your life, it seems weird to be going on without them. I mean, who cares now?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "A lot of people care," Janice says, clumsily earnest.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You don't know what it feels like," he tells her. "You still have your mother."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "For just a little while yet," Bessie says, playing an ace of clubs. Gathering in the trick with a deft rounding motion of her hand, she pronounces, "Your father now was a good worker, who never gave himself airs, but your mother I must confess I never could abide. A sharp tongue, in a plain body."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Mother. Harry loved his mother."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Bessie snaps down the ace of hearts. "Well that's right and proper I guess, at least they say it is, for a boy to like his mother. But I used to feel sorry for him when she was alive. She drove him to have an uncommon high opinion of himself and yet could give him nothing to grab a hold of, the way Fred and I could you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She talks of Harry as if he too is dead. "I'm still here, you kriow," he says, flipping on the lowest heart he has.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Bessie's mouth pinches in and her face slightly bloats as her black eyes stare down at her cards. "I know you're still here, I'm not saying anything I won't say to your face. Your mother was an unfortunate woman who caused a lot of devilment. You and Janice when you were starting out would never have had such a time of it if it hadn't been for Mary Angstrom, and that goes for ten years ago too. She thought too much of herself for what she was." Ma has that fanatic tight look about the cheeks women get when they hate one another. Mom didn't think that much of Bessie Springer either ? little upstart married to that crook, a woman without enough brains to grease a saucepan living in that big house over on Joseph Street looking down her nose. The Koerners were dirt farmers and not even the good dirt, they farmed the hills.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Mother, Harry's mother was bedridden all through that time the house burned down. She was dying."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not so dying she didn't stir up a lot of mischief before she went. If she'd have let you two work out your relations with these others there would never have been a separation and all the grief. She was envious of the Koerners and had been since Day One. I knew her when she was Mary Renninger two classes ahead of me in the old Thad Stevens School before they built the new high school where the Morris farm used to be, and she thought too much of herself then. The Renningers weren't country people, you see, they came right out of Brewer and had that slum mentality, that cockiness. Too tall for her sex and too big for her britches. Your sister, Harry, got all her looks from your father's side. Your father's father they say was one of those very fair Swedes, a plasterer." With a thump of her thumb she lays down the ace of diamonds.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You can't lead trump until after the third trick," Harry reminds her.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, foolish." She takes the ace back and stares at her cards through the unbecoming though fashionable eyeglasses she bought recently ? heavy blue shell frames hinged low to S?shaped temples and with a kind of continuous false eyebrow of silvery inlay. They aren't even comfortable, she has to keep touching the bridge to push them up on her little round nose.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Her agony is so great pondering the cards, Harry reminds her, "You only need one point to make your bid. You've already made it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yes, well . . . make all you can while you can, Fred used to say." She fans her cards a little wider. "Ali. I thought I had another one of those." She lays down a second ace of clubs.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> But Janice trumps it. She pulls in the trick and says, "Sorry, Mother. I only had a singleton of clubs, how could you know?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I had a feeling as soon as I put down that ace. I had a premonition."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry laughs; you have to love the old lady. Cabined with these two women, he has grown soft and confiding, as when he was a little boy and asked Mom where ladies went wee?wee. "I used to sometimes wonder," he confides to Bessie, "if Mom had ?ever, you know, been false to Pop."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I wouldn't have put it past her," she says, grim?upped as Janice leads out her own aces. Her eyes flash at Harry. "See, ifyou'd have let me play that diamond she wouldn't have gotten in."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Ma," he says, "you can't take every trick, don't be so greedy. I know Mom must have been sexy, because look at Mim."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What do you hear from your sister?" Ma asks to be polite, staring down at her cards again. The shadows thrown by her ornate spectacle frames score her cheeks and make her look old, dragged down, where there is no anger to swell the folds of her face.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Mim's fine. She's running this beauty parlor in Las Vegas. She's getting rich."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I never believed half ofwhat people said about her," Ma utters absently.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Now Janice has run through her aces and plays a king of spades to the ace she figures Harry must have. Since she joined up with that bridge?and?tennis bunch of witches over at the Flying Eagle, Janice isn't as dumb at cards as she used to be. Harry plays the expected ace and, momentarily in command, asks Ma Springer, "How much of my mother do you see in Nelson?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not a scrap," she says with satisfaction, whackingly trumping his ten of spades. "Not a whit."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What can I do for the kid?" he asks aloud. It is as if another has spoken, through him. Fog blowing through a window screen.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Be patient," Ma answers, triumphantly beginning to run out the trumps.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Be loving," Janice adds.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Thank God he's going back to college next month."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Their silence fills the cottage like cool lake air. Crickets.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He accuses, "You both know stuff I don't."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> They do not deny it.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He gropes. "What do you both think of Melanie, really? I think she depresses the kid."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I dare say the rest are mine," Ma Springer announces, laying down a raft of little diamonds.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Harry," Janice tells him. "Melanie's not the problem."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "If you ask me," Ma Springer says, so firmly they both know she wants the subject changed, "Melanie is making herself altogether too much at home."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> On television Charlie's Angels are chasing the heroin smugglers in a great array of expensive automobiles that slide and screech, that plunge through fruit carts and large panes of glass and finally collide one with another, and then another, tucking into opposing fenders and grilles in a great slow?motion climax of bent metal and arrested motion and final justice. The Angel who has replaced Farrah Fawcett?Majors gets out of her crumpled Malibu and tosses her hair: this becomes a freeze?frame. Nelson laughs in empathetic triumph over all those totalled Hollywood cars. Then the more urgent tempo and subtly louder volume of the commercial floods the room; a fresh palette of reflected light paints the faces, chubby and clownish side by side, of Melanie and Nelson as they sit on the old sofa of gray nappy stuff cut into a pattern and gaze at the television set where they have placed it in the rearranged living room, where the Barcalounger used to be. Beer bottles glint on the floor beneath their propped?up feet; hanging drifts of sweetish smoke flicker in polychrome as if the ghosts of Charlie's Angels are rising to the ceiling. "Great smash?up," Nelson pronounces, with difficulty rising and fumbling the television off.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I thought it was stupid," Melanie says in her voice of muffled singing.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh shit, you think everything is stupid except what's his name, Kerchief."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "G. I. Gurdjieff" She has a prim mode of withdrawal, into mental regions where she knows he cannot reach. At Kent it became clear there were realms real for others not real to him not just languages he didn't know, or theorems he couldn't grasp, but drifting areas of unprofitable knowledge where nevertheless profits of a sort were being made. Melanie was mystical, she ate no meat and felt no fear, the tangled weedy gods of Asia spelled a harmony to her. She lacked that fury against limits that had been part of Nelson since he had known he would never be taller than five nine though his father was six three, or perhaps before that since he had found himself helpless to keep his father and mother together and to save Jill from the ruin she wanted, or perhaps before that since he had watched grownups in dark suits and dresses assembling around a small white coffin, with silvery handles and something sparkly in the paint, that they told him held what had been his baby sister, born and then allowed to die without anybody asking him; nobody ever asked him, the grownup world was like that, it just ground on, and Melanie was part of that world, smugly smiling out at him from within that bubble where the mystery resided that amounted to power. It would be nice, as long as he was standing, to take up one of the beer bottles and smash it down into the curly hair of Melanie's skull and then to take the broken half still in his hand and rotate it into the smiling plumpnesses of her face, the great brown eyes and cherry lips, the mocking implacable Buddha calm. "I don't care what the fuck his dumb name is, it's all bullshit," he tells her instead.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You should read him," she says. "He's wonderful."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah, what does he say?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Melanie thinks, unsmiling. "It's not easy to sum up. He says there's a Fourth Way. Besides the way of the yogi, the monk, and the fakir."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, great."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And if you go this way you'll be what he calls awake."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Instead of asleep?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He was very interested in somehow grasping the world as it is. He believed we all have plural identities."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I want to go out," he tells her.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nelson, it's ten o'clock at night."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I promised I might meet Billy Fosnacht and some of the guys down at the Laid?Back." The Laid?Back is a new bar in Brewer, at the comer of Weiser and Pine, catering to the young. It used to be called the Phoenix. He accuses her, "You go out all the time with Stavros leaving me here with nothing to do."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You could read Gurdjieff," she says, and giggles. "Anyway I haven't gone out with Charlie more than four or five times."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah, you work all the other nights."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It isn't as if we ever do anything, Nelson. The last time we sat and watched television with his mother. You ought to see her. She looks younger than he does. All black hair." She touches her own dark, vital, springy hair. "She was wonderful."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson is putting on his denim jacket, bought at a shop in Boulder specializing in the worn?out clothes of ranch hands and sheep herders. It had cost twice what a new one would have cost. "I'm working on a deal with Billy. One of the other guys is going to be there. I gotta go."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Can I come along?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You're working tomorrow, aren't you?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You know I don't care about sleep. Sleep is giving in to the body."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I won't be late. Read one of your books." He imitates her giggle.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Melanie asks him, "When have you last written to Pru? You haven't answered any of her recent letters."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> His rage returns; his tight jacket and the very wallpaper of this room seem to be squeezing him smaller and smaller. "How can I, she writes twice every fucking day, it's worse than a newspaper. Christ, she tells me her temperature, what she's eaten, when she's taken a crap practically -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The letters are typewritten, on stolen Kent stationery, page after page, flawlessly.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She thinks you're interested," Melanie says in reproach. "She's lonely and apprehensive."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson gets louder. "She's apprehensive! What does she have to be apprehensive about? Here I am, good as gold, with you such a goddam watchdog I can't even go into town for a beer."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Go."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He is stabbed by guilt. "Honest, I did promise Billy; he's going to bring this kid whose sister owns a '76 TR convertible with only fifty?five thousand miles on it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Just go," Melanie says quietly. "I'll write to Pru and explain how you're too busy."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Too busy, too busy. Who the hell am I doing all this for except for fucking silly?ass Pru?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't know, Nelson. I honestly don't know what you're doing or who you're doing it for. I do know that I found a job, according to our plan, whereas you did nothing except finally bully your poor father into making up a job for you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "My poor father! Poor father! Listen who do you think put him where he is? Who do you think owns the company, my mother and grandmother own it, my father is just their front man and doing a damn lousy job of it too. Now that Charlie's run out of moxie there's nobody over there with any drive or creativity at all. Rudy and Jake are stooges. My father's running that outfit into the ground; it's sad."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You can say all that, Nelson, and that Charlie's run out of moxie which I think I'm in a better position than you to know, but you haven't shown me much capacity for responsibility."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He hears, though frustrated and guilty to the point of tears, a deliberate escalation in her "capacity for responsibility" in answer to his mention of "creativity." Against the Melanies of the world he will always come in tongue?tied. "Bullshit" is all he can say.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You have a lot of feelings, Nelson," she tells him. "But feel-
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> ings aren't actions." She stares at him as if to hypnotize him,
<br> 
<br> batting her eyes once.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh Christ. I'm doing exactly what you and Pru wanted me to do."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You see, that's how your mind works, putting everything off on others. We didn't want you to do anything specific, we just wanted you to cope like an adult. You couldn't seem to do it out there so you came back here to put yourself in phase with reality. I don't see that you've done it." When she bats her eyelids like that, her head becomes a doll's, all hollow inside. Fun to smash. "Charlie says," Melanie says, "you're overanxious as a salesman; when the people come in, they're scared away."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "They're scared away by the lousy tinny Japanese cars that cost a fortune because of the shit?eating yen. I wouldn't buy one, I don't see why anybody else should buy one. It's Detroit. Detroit has let everybody down, millions of people depending for jobs on Detroit's coming up with some decent car design and the assholes won't do it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't swear so much, Nelson. It doesn't impress me." As she gazes steadily up at him her eyeballs show plenty of white; he pictures the also plentiful white orbs of her breasts and he doesn't want this quarrel to progress so far she won't comfort him in bed. She hasn't ever sucked him off but he bets she does it for Charlie, that's the only way these old guys can get it up. Smiling that hollow?headed Buddha smile, Melanie says, "You go off and play with the other little boys, l'll stay here and write Pru and won't tell her you said her ass is silly. But I'm getting very tired, Nelson, of covering for you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well who asked you to? You're getting something out of it too." In Colorado she had been sleeping with a married man who was also the partner of the crumb Nelson was supposed to spend the summer working for, putting up condominiums in ski country. The man's wife was beginning to make loud noises though she had been around herself and the other guy Melanie was seeing had visions of himself as a cocaine supplier to the beautiful people at Aspen and yet lacked the cool and the contacts, and seemed headed for jail or an early grave depending on which foot he tripped over first. Roger the guy's name was and Nelson had liked him, the way he sidled along like a lanky yellow hound who knows he's going to be kicked. It had been Roger who had gotten them into hang gliding, Melanie too prudent but Pru surprisingly willing to try, joking about how this would be one way to solve all their problems. Her face so slender in the great white crash helmet they rented you at the Highlands base, up on the Golden Horn, in the second before the launch into astonishing, utterly quiet space she would give him that same wry sharp estimating look sideways he had seen the first time she had decided to sleep with him, in her little studio apartment in that factorylike high?rise over in Stow, her picture window above a parking lot. He had met Melanie first, in a course they both took called the Geography of Religions: Shintó, shamanism, the Jains, all sorts of antique superstitions thriving, according to the maps, in overlapping patches, like splotches of disease, and in some cases even spreading, the world was in such a desperate state. Pru was not a student but a typist for the Registrar's office over in Rockwell Hall; Melanie had gotten to know her during a campaign by the Students' League for a Democratic Kent to create discontent among the university employees, especially the secretaries. Most of such friendships withered when the next cause came along but Pru had stuck. She wanted something. Nelson had been drawn to her grudging crooked smile, as if she too had trouble spinning herself out for display, not like these glib kids who had gone from watching TV straight to the classroom with never a piece of the world's real weather to halt their tongues. And also her typist's hard long hands, like the hands of his grandmother Angstrom. She had taken her portable Remington west with her in hopes of finding some free?lance work out of Denver, so she typed her letters telling him when she went to sleep and when she woke up and when she felt like vomiting, whereas he has to respond in his handwriting that he hates, it is such a childish?looking scrawl. The fluent perfection of her torrent of letters overwhelms him, he couldn't have known she would be the source of such a stream. Girls write easier than boys somehow: he remembers the notes in green ink Jill used to leave around the house in Penn Villas. And he remembers, suddenly, more of the words of the song Mommom used to sing: "Reide, reide, Geile / Alle Schtunn en Medi / Geht's iwwer der Schtumbe / Fallt's Bubbli nunner!" with the last word, where Baby falls down, nunner, not sung but spoken, in a voice so solemn he always laughed.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What am I getting out of it, Nelson?" Melanie asks with that maddening insistent singingness.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Kicks," he tells her. "Safe kicks, too, the kind you like. Controlling me, more or less. Charming the old folks."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Her voice relaxes and she sounds sad. "I think that's wearing thin. Maybe I've talked too much to your grandmother."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Could be." As he stands there he feels some advantage return to him. This is his house, his town, his inheritance. Melanie is an outsider here.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well, I liked her," she says, strangely using the past tense. "I'm always drawn to older people."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She makes more sense at least than Mom and Dad."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What do you want me to tell Pru if I write?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't know." His shoulders shiver in his jacket as if the taut little coat is an electric contact; he feels his face cloud, even his breath grow hot. Those white envelopes, the white of the crash helmet she put on, the white of her belly. Space would open up immensely under you after you launched but was not menacing somehow, the harness holding you tight and the trees falling away smaller along the grassy ski trails and tilted meadows below and the great nylon wing responsive to every tug on the control bar. "Tell her to hold on."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Melanie says, "She's been holding on, Nelson, she can't keep holding on forever. I mean, it shows. And I can't stay on here much longer either. I have to visit my mother before I go back to Kent."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Everything seems to complicate, physically, in front of his mouth, so he is conscious of the effort of breathing. "And I gotta get to the Laid?Back before everybody leaves."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, go. Just go. But tomorrow I want you to help me start tidying up. They'll be back Sunday and you haven't once weeded the garden or mowed the lawn."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Driving Ma Springer's cushy old Newport up Jackson to where Joseph Street intersects, the first thing Harry sees is his tomato?red Corona parked in front, looking spandy?new and just washed besides. They had got it fixed at last. It was cute of the kid to have had it washed. Loving, even. A surge of remorse for all the ill will he has been bearing Nelson gives a quickening countercurrent to the happiness he feels at being back in Mt. Judge, on a sparkling Sunday noon late in August with the dry?grass smell of football in the air and the maples thinking of turning gold. The front lawn, even that awkward little section up by the azalea bushes and the strip between the sidewalk and the curb where roots are coming to the surface and hand?clippers have to be used, has been mowed. Harry knows how those hand?clippers begin to chafe in the palm. When the boy comes out on the porch and down to the street to help with the bags, Harry shakes Nelson's hand. He thinks of kissing him but the start of a frown scares him off his impulse to be extra friendly flounders and drowns amidst the clutter of greetings. Janice embraces Nelson and, more lightly, Melanie. Ma Springer, overheated from the car ride, allows herself to be kissed on the cheek by both young people. Both are dressed up, Melanie in a peach?colored linen suit Harry didn't know she owned and Nelson in a gray sharkskin he knows the boy didn't have before. A new suit to be a salesman in. The effect is touchingly trimmer; ?in the tilt of the child's combed head his father is startled to see a touch of the dead Fred Springer, con artist.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Melanie looks taller than he remembers: high heels. In her pleased croon of a voice she explains, "We went to church," turning toward Ma Springer. "You had said over the phone you might try to make the service and we thought we'd surprise you in case you did."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Melanie, I couldn't get them up in time," Bessie says. "They were just a pair of lovebirds up there."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "The mountain air, nothing personal," Rabbit says, handing Nelson a duffel bag full of dirty sheets. "It was supposed to be a vacation and I wasn't going to get up at dawn the last day we were there just so Ma could come make cow eyes at that fag."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He didn't seem that faggy, Dad. That's just how ministers talk."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "To me he seemed pretty radical," Melanie says. "He went on about how the rich have to go through a camel's eye." To Harry she says, "You look thinner."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He's been running, like an idiot," Janice says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Also not having to eat lunch at a restaurant every day," he says. "They give you too much. It's a racket."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Mother, be careful of the curb," Janice says sharply. "Do you want an arm?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I've been managing this curb for thirty years, you don't need to tell me it's here."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nelson, help Mother up the steps," Janice nevertheless says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "The Corona looks great," Harry tells the boy. "Better than new." He suspects, though, that that annoying bias in the steering will still be there.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I really got on 'em abut it, Dad. Manny kept giving it bottom priority because it was yours and you weren't here. I told him by the time you were here I wanted that car done, period."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Take care of the paying customers first," Harry says, vaguely obliged to defend his service chief.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Manny's a jerk," the boy calls over his shoulder as he steers his grandmother and the duffel bag through the front door, under the stained?glass fanlight that holds among leaded foliate shapes the number 89.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Toting suitcases, Harry follows them in. This house had faded in his mind. "Oh boy," he breathes. "Like an old shoe."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ma is dutifully admiring the neatness, the flowers from the border beds arranged in vases on the sideboard and dining?room table, the vacuumed rugs and the laundered antimacassars on the nappy gray sofa and matching easy chair. She touches the tufted chenille. "These pieces haven't looked so good since Fred fought with the cleaning woman, old Elsie Lord, and we had to let her go."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Melanie explains, "If you use a damp brush, with just a dab of rug cleaner -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Melanie, you know how to do a job," Harry says. "The only trouble with you, you should have been a man." This comes out rougher than he had intended, but a sudden small vexation had thrown him off balance when he stepped into the house. His house, yet not his. These stairs, those knickknacks. He lives here like a boarder, a rummy old boarder in his undershirt, too fuddled to move. Even Ruth has her space. He wonders how his roundfaced girl is doing, out in that overgrown terrain, in her sandstone house with its scabby green door.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ma Springer is sniffing the air. "Something smells sweet," she says. "It must be the rug cleaner you used."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson is at Harry's elbow, closer than he usually gets. "Dad, speaking of jobs, I have something I want to show you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't show me anything till I get these bags upstairs. It's amazing how much crap you need just to walk around in sneakers in the Poconos."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice bangs the kitchen door, coming in from the outside. "Harry, you should see the garden, it's all beautifully weeded! The lettuce comes up to my knees, the kohlrabi has gotten enormous!"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry says to the young people, "You should have eaten some, the kohlrabi gets pulpy if you let it grow too big."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It never has any taste, Dad," Nelson says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah. I guess nobody much likes it except me." He likes to nibble, is one reason he's fat. While growing up he had many sensitive cavities and now that he has his molars crowned eating has become perhaps too much of a pleasure. No more twinges, just everlasting gold.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Kohlrabi," Melanie is saying dreamily, "I wondered what it was, Nelson kept telling me turnips. Kohlrabi is rich in vitamin C. "
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How're the crepes cooking these days?" Harry asks her, trying to make up for having told the girl she should have been a man. He may have hit on something, though; in her a man's normal bossiness has had to turn too sweet.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Fine. I've given them my notice and the other waitresses are going to give me a party."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson says, "She's turned into a real party girl, Dad. I hardly ever saw her when we were here together. Your pal Charlie Stavros keeps taking her out, he's even coming for her this afternoon."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> You poor little shnook, Rabbit thinks. Why is the kid standing so close? He can hear the boy's worried breath.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He's taking me to Valley Forge," Melanie explains, brighteyed, those bright eyes concealing what mischief, Rabbit may never know now. The girl is pulling out. "I'm about to leave Pennsylvania and I really haven't seen any of the sights, so Charlie's being nice enough to take me to some of the places. Last weekend we went into Amish country and saw all the buggies."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Depressing damn things, aren't they?" Harry says, going on, "Those Amish are mean bastards ? mean to their kids, to their animals, to each other."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Dad
<br> 
<br> "If you're going as far as Valley Forge you might as well go look at the Liberty Bell, see if it still has a crack in it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "We weren't sure it was open Sundays."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Philly in August is a sight to see anyhow. One big swamp of miserable humanity. They cut your throat for a laugh down there."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Melanie, I'm so sorry to hear you're leaving," Janice intervenes smoothly. It sometimes startles Harry, how smooth Janice can be in her middle age. Looking back, he and Jan were pretty rough customers ? kids with a grudge, and not much style. No style, in fact. A little dough does wonders.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah," the guest of their summer says, "I should visit my family. My mother and sisters, I mean, in Carmel. I don't know if I'll go up to see my father or not, he's gotten so strange. And then back to college. It's been wonderful staying here, you were all so kind. I mean, considering that you didn't even know me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No problem," Harry says, wondering about her sisters, if they all have such eyes and ruby lips. "You did it yourself; you paid your way." Lame, lame. Never could talk to her.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I know Mother will really miss your company," Janice says, and calls over, "Isn't that right, Mother?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> But Ma Springer is examining the china in her breakfront, to see if anything has been stolen, and doesn't seem to hear.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry asks Nelson abruptly, "So what did you want to show me in such a hurry?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's over at the lot," the boy says. "I thought we could drive over when you came back."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Can't I even have lunch first? I hardly had any breakfast, with all this talk of making church. Just a couple of Pecan Sandies that the ants hadn't gotten to." His stomach hurts to think of it.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't think there is that much for lunch," Janice says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Melanie offers, "There's some wheat germ and yogurt in the fridge, and some Chinese vegetables in the freezer."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I have no appetite," Ma Springer announces. "And I want to try my own bed. Without exaggerating I don't believe I had more than three hours' sleep in a row all that time up there. I kept hearing the raccoons."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She's just sore about missing church," Rabbit tells the others. He feels trapped by all this fuss of return. There is a tension here that wasn't here before. You never return to the same place. Think of the dead coming back on Resurrection Day. He goes out through the kitchen into his garden and eats a kohlrabi raw, tearing off the leaves with his hands and stripping the skin from the bland crisp bulb with his front teeth. The butch women up the street are still hammering away ? what can they be building? How did that poem used to go? Build thee more stately something O my soul. Lofty Bingaman would have known, waving her hand in the air. The air feels nice. A flatter noon than earlier, the summer settling to its dust. The trees have dulled down from the liquid green of June and the undertone of insect hum has deepened to a constant dry rasp, if you listen. The lettuce is tall and seedy, the beans are by, a carrot he pulls up is stubby as a fat man's prick, all its push gone upwards into greens. Back in the kitchen Janice has found some salami not too dried?out to eat and has made sandwiches for him and Nelson. This excursion to the lot seems bound to happen, when Harry had hoped to get over to the club this afternoon and see if the gang has missed him. He can see them gathered by the shuddering bright pool of chlorinated aqua, laughing, Buddy and his dog of the month, the Harrisons, foxy old Webb and his little Cindy. Little Cindy Blackbottom Babytoes. Real sunlight people, not these shadows in the corners of Ma's glum house. Charlie honks out front but doesn't come in. Embarrassed, and he should be, the babysnatcher. Harry looks at Janice to see how she takes it when the front door slams. Not a flicker. Women are tough. He asks her, "So what're you going to do this afternoon?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I was going to tidy up the house, but Melanie seems to have done it all. Maybe I'll go over to the club and see if I can get into a game. At least I could swim." She swam at Hourglass Lake, and in truth does look more supple through the middle, longer from hips to breasts. Not a bad little bride, he sometimes thinks, surprised by their connivance in this murky world of old blood and dark strangers.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How'd you like that, about Charlie and Melanie?" he asks.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She shrugs, imitating Charlie. "I like it fine, why not? More power to him. You only live once. They say."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Whyn't you go over and Nellie and I'll come join you after I look at this thing of his, whatever it is?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson comes into the kitchen, mouth ajar, eyes suspicious.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice says, "Or I could come with you and Nelson to the lot and then we all three could go to the club together and save gas by using only the one car."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Mom, it's business," Nelson protests, and from the way his face clouds both parents see that they had better let him have his way. His gray suit makes him seem extra vulnerable, in the way of children placed in unaccustomed clothes for ceremonies they don't understand.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> So Nelson and Harry, behind the wheel of his Corona for the first time in a month, drive through the Sunday traffic the route they both know better than the lines in their palms, down Joseph to Jackson to Central and around the side of the mountain. Harry says, "Car feels a little different, doesn't it?" This is a bad start; he tries to patch it with, "Guess a car never feels the same after it's been banged up."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson bridles. "It was just a dent, it didn't have anything to do with the front end, that's where you'd feel the difference if there was any."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry holds his breath and then concedes, "Probably imagining it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> They pass the view of the viaduct and then the shopping center where the four?theater complex advertises AGATHA MANHATTAN MEATBALLS AMITYVILLE HORROR. Nelson asks, "Did you read the book, Dad?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What book?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Amityville Horror. The kids at Kent were all passing it around."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Kids at Kent. Lucky stiffs. What he could have done with an education. Been a college coach somewhere. "It's about a haunted house, isn't it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Dad, it's about Satanism. The idea is some previous occupant of the house had conjured up the Devil and then he wouldn't go away. Just an ordinary?looking house on Long Island."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You believe this stuff?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well ? there's evidence that's pretty hard to get around."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit grunts. Spineless generation, no grit, nothing solid to tell a fact from a spook with. Satanism, pot, drugs, vegetarianism. Pathetic. Everything handed to them on a platter, think life's one big TV, full of ghosts.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson reads his thoughts and accuses: "Well you believe all that stuff they say in church and that's really sick. You should have seen it, they were giving out communion today and it was incredible, all these people sort of patting their mouths and looking serious when they come back from the altar rail. It was like something out of anthropology."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "At least," Harry says, "it makes people like your grandmother feel better. Who does this Amityville horror make feel better?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's not supposed to, it's just something that happened. The people in the house didn't want it to happen either, it just did." From the pitch of his voice the kid is feeling more in a corner than Rabbit had intended. He doesn't want to think about the invisible anyway; every time in his life he's made a move toward it somebody has gotten killed.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> In silence father and son wind along Cityview Drive, with its glimpses through trees grown too tall of the flowerpot?colored city that German workers built on a grid laid out by an English surveyor and where now the Polacks and spics and blacks sit crammed in listening to each other's television sets jabber through the walls, and each other's babies cry, and each other's Saturday nights turn ugly. Tricky to drive now, all these bicycles and mopeds and worst of all the roller skaters in jogging shorts with earphones on their heads, looking like boxers, all doped up, roller- skating as though they owned the street. The Corona coasts along Locust, where the doctors and lawyers hole up in their long brick single?family dwellings, set back and shady, with retaining walls and plantings of juniper fighting the slope of the ground, and pass-es on the right Brewer High, that he thought of as a kid as a cas-tle, the multiple gyms and rows of lockers you wouldn't believe, receding to infinity it seemed, the few times he went there, the times the Mt. Judge varsity played the Brewer JV squad, more or less for laughs (theirs). He thinks of telling Nelson about this, but knows the kid hates to have him reminisce about his sporting days. Brewer kids, Rabbit remembers in silence, were mean, with something dirty?looking about their mouths, as if they'd all just sucked raspberry popsicles. The girls fucked and some of the really vicious types smoked things called reefers in those days. Now even Presidents' kids, that Ford son and who knows about Chip, fuck and smoke reefers. Progress. In a way, he sees now, he grew up in a safe pocket of the world, like Melanie said, like one of those places you see in a stream where the twigs float backward and accumulate along the mud.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> As they swing down into the steep part of Eisenhower, Nelson breaks the silence and asks, "Didn't you used to live up on one of these cross streets?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah. Summer. For a couple of months, ages ago. Your mother and I were having some problems. What makes you ask?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I just remembered. Like when you feel you've been someplace before, only it must have been in a dream. When I'd miss you real bad Mom used to put me in the car and we'd drive over here and look at some house hoping you'd come out. It was in a row that all looked alike to me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And did I? Come out."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not that I can ever remember. But I don't remember much about it, just being there in the car, and Mom having brought some cookies along to keep me entertained, and her starting to cry."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Jesus, I'm sorry. I never knew about this before, that she drove you over."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Maybe it just happened once. But it feels like more than once. I remember her being so big."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Eisenhower flattens out and they pass without comment number 1204, where Janice years later had fled to Charlie Stavros, and where Nelson used to come on his bicycle and look up at the window. The kid had been desperate for a mini?bike at the time, and Mim had finally gotten him one, but he hadn't used it much, a sadness had attached to it, it was a piece ofjunk somewhere now. Funny about feelings, they seem to come and go in a flash yet outlast metal.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Down over the abandoned car yards they go, through the factory outlet district, and left on Third, then right on lower Weiser, past white windowless Schoenbaum Funeral Directors, and then over the bridge. The traffic is mostly composed of old ladies poking back from their restaurant lunch they owed themselves after church and of carloads of kids already beered?up heading for the ballgame in the stadium north of Brewer where the Blasts play. Left on Route 111. D I S C O. FUEL ECONOMY. They have forgotten to turn on the radio, so distracting has the tension between them been. Harry clears his throat and says, "So Melanie's getting set to go back to college. You must be too."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Silence. The subject of college is hot, too hot to touch. He should have been asking the kid what he's been learning at the lot. SPRINGER MOTORS. They pull in. Three weeks since Harry's seen it, and as with the house there's been a pollution. That Caprice he sometimes drove when the Corona was out of action isn't there, must have been sold. Six new Corollas are lined up next to the highway in their sweet and sour colors. Harry can never quite get over how small their wheels look, almost like tricycle wheels compared to the American cars he grew up with. Still, they're the guts of the line: buy cheap, most people are still poor, face it. You don't ?get something for nothing but hope springs eternal. Like a little sea of melting candy his cars bake in the sun. Since it's Sunday Harry parks right next to the hedge that struggles up front around the entrance and that collects at its roots all the stray wrappers and napkins that blow across 111 from the Chuck Wagon. The display windows need washing again. A paper banner bearing the slogan of the new TV campaign, OH WHAT A FEELING, fills the top half of the lefthand pane. The showroom has two new Celicas, one black with a yellow side stripe and one blue with a white one. Under the OH WHAT A FEELING poster, featuring some laughing cunt in a bathing suit splashing around in some turquoise pool with an Alp or Rocky in the background, lurks something different, a little low roachlike car that is no Toyota. Harry has no key; Nelson lets them in the double glass door with his. The strange car is a TR?6 convertible, polished up for sale but unmistakably worn, the windshield dull with the multiplied scratches of great mileage, the fender showing that slight ripple where metal has been bruised and healed. "What the hell is this?" Harry asks, lifted to a great height by the comparative lowness of this intruding automobile.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Dad, that's my idea we talked about, to sell convertibles. Honest, hardly anybody makes 'em anymore, even Jaguar has quit, they're bound to go up and up. We're asking fifty?five hundred and already a couple of guys have almost bought it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why'd the owner get rid of it if it was worth so much? What'd you give him on the trade?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well, it wasn't a trade?in exactly -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What was it, exactly?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "We bought it -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You bought it!"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "A friend of Billy Fosnacht's has this sister who's marrying some guy who's moving to Alaska. It's in great shape, Manny went all over it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Manny and Charlie let you go ahead with this?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why wouldn't they? Charlie's been telling me how he and old man Springer used to do all these crazy things, they'd give away stuffed animals and crates of oranges and have these auctions with girls in evening gowns where the highest bid got the car even if it was only five dollars ? guys from car rodeos used to come -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That was the good old days. These are the bad new days. People come in here looking for Toyotas, they don't want some fucking British sports car -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "But they will, once we have the name."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "We have a name. Springer Motors, Toyota and used. That's what we're known for and that's what people come in here for." He hears his voice straining, feels that good excited roll of anger building in him, like in a basketball game when you're down ten points and less than five minutes left on the clock and you've just taken one too many elbows in the ribs, and all the muscles go loose suddenly and something begins lifting you and you know nothing is impossible, with faith. He tries to hold himself back, this is a fragile kid and his son. Still, this has been his lot. "I don't remember discussing any convertibles with you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "One night, Dad, we were sitting in the living room just the two of us, only you got sore about the Corona and changed the subject."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And Charlie really gave you the green light?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Sure; he kind of shrugged. With you gone he had the new cars to manage, and this whole shipment came in early -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah. I saw. That close to the road they'll pick up all the dust."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "? and anyway Charlie's not my boss. We're equals. I told him Mom?mom had thought it was a good idea."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh. You talked to Ma Springer about this?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well not exactly at the time, she was off with you and Mom, but I know she wants me to plug into the lot, so it'll be three generations and all that stuff."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry nods. Bessie will back the kid, they're both black?eyed Springers. "O.K., I guess no harm done. How much you pay for this crate?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He wanted forty?nine hundred but I jewed him down to forty?two."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Jesus. That's way over book. Did you look at the book? Do you know what the book is?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Dad of course I know what the fucking book is, the point is convertibles don't go by the book, they're like antiques, there's only so many and there won't be any more. They're what they call collectibles."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You paid forty?two for a '76 TR that cost six new. How many miles on it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "A girl drove it, they don't drive a car hard."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Depends on the girl. Some of these tootsies I see on the road are really pushing. How many miles did you say?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well, it's kind of hard to say; this guy who went to Alaska was trying to fix something under the dashboard and I guess he didn't know which -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh boy. O.K., let's see if we can unload it for wholesale and chalk it up to experience. I'll call Hornberger in town tomorrow, he still handles TR and MG, maybe he'll take it off our hands as a favor."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry realizes why Nelson's short haircut troubles him: it reminds him of how the boy looked back in grade school, before all that late Sixties business soured everything. He didn't know how short he was going to be then, and wanted to become a baseball pitcher like Jim Bunning, and wore a cap all summer that pressed his hair in even tighter to his skull, that bony freckled unsmiling face. Now his necktie and suit seem like that baseball cap to be the costume of doomed hopes. Nelson's eyes brighten as if at the approach of tears. "Take if off our hands for cost? Dad, I know we can sell it, and clear a thousand. And there's two more."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Two more TRs?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Two more convertibles, out back." By now the kid is scared, white in the face so his eyelids and eartips look pink. Rabbit is scared too, he doesn't want any more of this, but things are rolling, the kid has to show him, and he has to react. They walk back along the corridor past the parts department, Nelson leading the way and picking a set of car keys offthe pegboard fastened next to the metal doorframe, and then they let themselves into the great hollow space of the garage, so silent on Sunday, a bare?girdered ballroom with its good warm stink of grease and acetylene. Nelson switches off the burglar alarm and pushes against the crash bar of the back door. Air again. Brewer far across the river, the tip of the tall courthouse with its eagle in concrete relief peeking above the forest of weeds, thistle and poke, at the lot's unvisited edge. This back area is bigger than it should be and always makes Rabbit think somehow of Paraguay. Making a little island of their own on the asphalt, two extinct American convertibles sit: a '72 Mercury Cougar, its top a tattered cream and its body that intense pale scum?color they called Nile Green, and a '74 Olds Delta 88 Royale, in color the purply?red women wore as nail polish in the days of spy movies. They were gallant old boats, Harry has to admit to himself, all that stretched tin and aerodynamical razzmatazz, headed down Main Street straight for a harvest moon with the old accelerator floored. He says, "These are here on spec, or what? I mean, you haven't paid for them yet." He senses that even this is the wrong thing to say.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "They're bought, Dad. They're ours."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "They're mine?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "They're not yours, they're the company's."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How the hell'd you work it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What do you mean, how the hell? I just asked Mildred Kroust to write the checks and Charlie told her it was O.K."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Charlie said it was O.K.?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He thought we'd all agreed. Dad, cut it out. It's not such a big deal. That's the idea here, isn't it ? buy cars and sell 'em at a profit?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not those crazy cars. How much were they?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I bet we make six, seven hundred on the Merc and more on the Olds. Dad, you're too uptight. It's only money. Was I supposed to have any responsibility while you were away, or not?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How much?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I forget exactly. The Cougar was about two thousand and the Royale, some dealer toward Pottsville that Billy knows had it but I thought we should be able to offer, you know, a selection, it came to I think around two?five."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Two thousand five hundred dollars."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Just repeating the numbers slowly makes him feel good, in a bad kind ofway. Any debt he ever owed Nelson is being paid back now. He goes at it again. "Two thousand five hundred good American -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The child almost screams. "We'll get it back, I promise! It's like antiques, it's like gold! You can't lose, Dad."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry can't stop adding. "Forty?two hundred for the little chop?clock TR, four thousand five hundred -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The boy is begging. "Leave me alone, I'll do it myself. I've already put an ad in the paper, they'll be gone in two weeks. I promise."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You promise. You'll be back in college in two weeks."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Dad. I won't."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You won't?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I want to quit Kent and stay here and work." This little face all frightened and fierce, so pale his freckles seem to be coming forward and floating on the surface, like flecks in a mirror.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Jesus, that is all I need," Harry sighs.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson looks at him shocked. He holds up the car keys. His eyes blur, his lower lip is unsteady. "I was going to let you drive the Royale for fun."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry says, "Fun. You know how much gas these old hot rods bum? You think people today with gas a dollar a gallon are going to want these eight?cylinder inefficient guzzlers just to feel the wind in their hair? Kid, you're living in a dream world."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "They don't care, Dad. People don't care that much about money anymore, it's all shit anyway. Money is shit."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Maybe to you but not to me I'll tell you that now. Let's keep calm. Think of the parts. These things sure as hell need some work, the years they've been around. You know what six?, sevenyear?old parts cost these days, when you can get 'em at all? This isnit some fancy place dealing in antiques, we sell Toyotas. Toyotas."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The child shrinks beneath his thunder. "Dad, I won't buy any more, I promise, until these sell. These'll sell, I promise."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You'll promise me nothing. You'll promise me to keep your nose out of my car business and get your ass back to Ohio. I hate to be the one telling you this, Nelson, but you're a disaster. You've gotta get yourself straightened out and it isn't going to happen here."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He hates what he's saying to the kid, though it's what he feels. He hates it so much he turns his back and tries to get back into the door they came out of but it has locked behind them, as it's supposed to do. He's locked out of his own garage and Nelson has the keys. Rabbit rattles the knob and thumps the metal door with the heel of his hand and even as in a blind scrimmage knees it; the pain balloons and coats the world in red so that though he hears a car motor start up not far away he doesn't connect it to himself until a squeak of rubber and a roar of speed slam metal into metal. That black gnashing cuts through the red. Rabbit turns around and sees Nelson backing off for a second go. Small parts are still settling, tinkling in the sunshine. He thinks the boy might now aim to crush him against the door where he is paralyzed but that is not the case. The Royale rams again into the side of the Mercury, which lifts up on two wheels. The pale green fender collapses enough to explode the headlight; the lens rim flies free.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Seeing the collision coming, Harry expected it to happen in slow motion, like on television, but instead it happened comically fast, like two dogs tangling and then thinking better of it. The Royale's motor dies. Through the windshield's granular fracture Nelson's face looks distorted, twisted by tears, twisted small. Rabbit feels a wooden sort of choked hilarity rising within him as he contemplates the damage. Pieces of glass finer than pebbles, bright grit, on the asphalt. Shadows on the broad skins of metal where shadows were not designed to be. The boy's short haircut looking like a round brush as he bends his face to the wheel sobbing. The whisper of Sunday traffic continuing from the other side of the building. These strange awkward blobs of joy bobbing in Harry's chest. Oh what a feeling.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Within a week, at the club, it has become a story he tells on himself. "Five thousand bucks' worth of metal, crunch. I had this terrible impulse to laugh, but the kid was in there crying, they were his cars after all, the way he saw it. The only thing I could think of to do was go stand by the Olds with my arms out like this." He spreads his arms wide, under the benign curve of the mountain. "If the kid'd come out swinging my gut would've been wide open. But sure enough he stumbles out all blubbery and I take him into my arms." He demonstrates the folding, consoling motion. "I haven't felt so close to Nelson since he was about two. What makes me really feel rotten, he was right. His ad for the convertibles ran that same Sunday and we must have had twenty calls. The TR was gone by Wednesday, for fifty?five Cs. People aren't counting their pennies anymore, they're throwin' 'em out the window."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Like the Arabs," Webb Murkett says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Jesus, those Arabs," Buddy Inglefinger says. "Wouldn't it be bliss just to nuke 'em all?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Did you see what gold did last week?" Webb smiles. "That's the Arabs dumping their dollars in Europe. They smell a rat."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buddy asks, "D'you see in today's paper where some investigation out of Washington showed that absolutely the government rigged the whole gas shortage last June?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "We knew it at the time, didn't we?" Webb asks back, the red hairs that arc out of his eyebrows glinting.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Today is the Sunday before Labor Day, the day of the members?only fourball. Their foursome has a late starting time and they are having a drink by the pool waiting, with their wives. With some of their wives: Buddy Inglefinger has no wife, just that same dumb pimply Joanne he's been dragging around all summer, and Janice this morning said she'd go with her mother to church and show up at the club around drink time, for the after?the?fourball banquet. This is strange. Janice loves the Flying Eagle even more than he does. But ever since Melanie left the house this last 'Wednesday something is cooking. Charlie has taken two weeks off now that Harry is back from the Poconos, and with Nelson being persona non grata around the lot the Chief Sales Representative has his hands full. There is always a little uptick at the end of summer, what with the fall models being advertised and raised prices already in the wind and the standing inventory beginning to look like a bargain, what with inflation worse and worse. There always comes in September a parched brightness to the air that hits Rabbit two ways, smelling of apples and blackboard dust and marking the return to school and work in earnest, but then again reminding him he's suffered another promotion, taken another step up the stairs that has darkness at the head.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Cindy Murkett hoists herself out of the pool. Dry sun catches in every drop beaded on her brown shoulders, so tan the skin bears a flicker of iridescence. Her boyishly cut hair is plastered in a fringe of accidental feathers halfway down the back of her skull. Standing on the flagstones, she tilts her head to twist water from this hair. Hair high inside her thigh merges with the black triangle of her string bikini. Walking over to their group, Cindy leaves plump wet footprints, heel and sole pad and tiny round toes. Little circular darkdab sucky toes.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You think gold is still a good thing to buy?" Harry asks Webb, but the man has turned his narrow creased face to gaze up at his young wife. The fat eaves of her body drip onto his lap, the checks of his golf pants, darkening their lime green by drops. From the length of those eyebrow hairs of Webb's that curve out it's a wonder some don't stab him in the eye. He hugs her hips sideways; the Murketts look framed as for an ad against the green sweep of Mt. Pemaquid. Behind them a diver knifes supply into the chlorine. Harry's eyes sting.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Thelma Harrison has been listening to his story, its sad undertone. "Nelson must have been desolated by what he'd done," she says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He likes the word "desolated," so old?fashioned, coming from this mousy sallow woman who somehow keeps the lid on that jerk Harrison. "Not so's you'd notice," he says. "We had that moment right after it happened, but he's been mean as hell to everybody since, especially since I made the mistake of telling him his ad had produced some results. He wants to keep coming to the lot but I told him to stay the hell away. You know what he did borders on
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Thelma offers, "Maybe there's more on his mind than he can tell you." The sun must be right behind his head from the way she shields her eyes to look up at him, even though she has on her sunglasses, big rounded brown ones that darken at the top like windshields. They hide the top half of her face so her lips seem to move with a strange precise independence; though thin, they have a dozen little curves that might fit sweetly around Harrison's thick prick, if you try to think what her hold on him might be, though this is hard to imagine. She's such a schoolteacher with her little pleated skirt and studied way of holding herself and pronouncing words. For all of her lotions her nose is pink and the pinkness 'spreads into the area below her eyes, that her sunglasses all but hide.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> In his floating wifeless state beside the pool, near the bottom of his g?and?t with its wilted sprig of mint, waiting for his fourball to start, he finds Thelma's solemn staring mottled look a bit befuddling. "Yeah," he says, eyes on the sprig. "Janice keeps suggesting that. But she won't tell me what it might be."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Maybe she can't," Thelma says, pressing her legs together tighter and tugging the skirt of her bathing suit down over an inch of thigh. She has these little purple veins women her age get but Harry can't see why she'd be self?conscious with an old potbellied pal like him.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He tells her, "He doesn't seem to want to go back to college so maybe he's flunked out and never told us. But wouldn't we have gotten a letter from the dean or something? These letters from Colorado, boy, we see plenty of them."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You know Harry," Thelma tells him, "a lot of fathers Ronnie and I know complain how the boys don't want to come into the family business. They have these businesses and no one to carry them on. It's a tragedy. You should be glad Nelson does care about cars."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "All he cares about is smashing 'em up," Harry says. "It's his revenge." He lowers his voice to confide, "I think one of the troubles between me and the kid is every time I had a little, you know, slip?up, he was there to see it. That's one of the reasons I don't like to have him around. The little twerp knows it, too."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ronnie Harrison, trying to put some kind of a move on poor old Joanne, looks up and shouts across to his wife, "What's the old hotshot trying to sell ya, hon? Don't let him do a number on ya."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Thelma ignores her husband with a dim smile and tells Harry matter?of?factly, "I think that's more in you than in Nelson. I'm wondering, could he be having girl trouble? Nelson."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry is wondering if another g?and?t might erase a little headache that's beginning. Drinking in the middle of the day always does that to him. "Well I can't see how. These kids, they just drift in and out of each other's beds like a bunch of gerbils. This girl he brought with him, Melanie, they didn't seem to have any contact really, in fact were getting pretty short with each other toward the end. She took some kind of a crazy shine to Charlie Stavros, of all people."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why `of all people'?" Her smile is less dim, its thin curves declare that she knows Charlie had been Janice's lover, in the time before this club existed.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well he's old enough to be her father for one thing and he has one foot in the grave for another. He had rheumatic fever as a kid and it left him with a bum ticker. You ought to see him toddle around the lot now, it's pathetic."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Having an ailment doesn't mean you want to give up living," she says. "You know I have what they call lupus; that's why I try to protect myself against the sun and can't get nice and tan like Cindy."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh. Really?" Why is she telling him this?
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Thelma from a wryness in her smile sees that she's presumed. "Some men with heart murmurs live forever," she says. "And now the girl and Charlie are out of the county together."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> This is a new thought also. "Yeah, but in totally different directions. Charlie goes to Florida and Melanie's visiting her family on the West Coast." But he remembers Charlie talking up Florida to her at the dinner table and he finds the possibility that they are together depressing. You can't trust anybody not to fuck. He turns his head to let the sun strike the skin of his face; his eyes close, the lids glowing red. He should be practicing chipping for the fourball instead of lying here drowning in these voices. He heard on the radio driving over that a hurricane is approaching Florida.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ronnie Harrison's voice, close at hand, shouts, "What's that hon, you say I'm going to live forever? You bet your sweet bippy I amt"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit opens his eyes and sees that Ronnie has changed the position of his chair to make room for Cindy Murkett, who is at home enough now among them all not to fuss covering her lap with the towel the way she did earlier in the summer; she just sits there on the wire grid of her poolside chair naked but for a few black strings and the little triangles they hold in place, letting her boobs wobble the way they will as she pushes back the wet hair from her ears and temples, not once but several times, selfconscious at that. In her happiness with Webb she is letting her weight slip up, there is almost too much baby fat; when she stands, Harry knows, the pattern of the chair bottom will be printed in the backs of her thighs like a waffle iron releasing two warm slabs of dark dough. Still, that wobble: to lick and suck and let them fall first one and then the other into your eyesockets. He closes his eyes. Ronme Harrison is trying to entrance Joanne and Cindy simultaneously with a story that involves a lot of deep?pitched growling as the hero?self talks back to the villain?other. What a conceited shit.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Webb Murkett leans forward to tell Harry, "In answer to your question, yes, I think gold is an excellent buy. It's up over sixty per cent in less than a year and I see no reason for it not to appreciate at the same rate as long as the world energy situation holds. The dollar is bound to keep leaking, Harry, until they figure out how to get gasoline cheap out of grain alcohol, which'll put us back in the driver's seat. Grain we've got."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> From the other side of the group, Buddy Inglefinger calls over, "Nuke 'em, I say; let's take their oil from the Arabs the same way we took it from the Eskimos." Joanne gives this an obligatory giggle, Ronnie's story having been overridden for a minute. Buddy sees Harry as his straight man and calls, "Hey Harry, did you see in Time where people stuck with their big old American cars are giving 'em to charity and taking a deduction or leaving 'em on the street to be stolen so they can collect the insurance? It said some dealer somewhere is giving you a free Chevette if you buy a Cadillac Eldorado."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "We don't get Time," Harry tells him coolly. Looked at a certain way, the world is full of twerps. Oh but to close your eyes and just flicker out with your tongue for Cindy's nipples as she swung them back and forth, back and forth, teasing.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Joanne tries to join in: "Meanwhile the President is floating down the Mississippi."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What else can the poor schmuck do?" Harry asks her, himself feeling floating and lazy and depressed.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hey Rabbit," Harrison calls, "whaddidya think when he was attacked by that killer rabbit?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> This gets enough of a laugh so they stop teasing him. Thelma speaks softly at his side. "Children are hard. Ron and I have been lucky with Alex, once we gave him an old television set he could take apart he's known what he's wanted to do, electronics. But now our other boy Georgie sounds a lot like your Nelson, though he's a few years younger. He thinks what his father does is gruesome, betting against people that they're going to die, and Ron can't make him understand how life insurance is really such a small part of the whole business."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "They're disillusioned," Webb Murkett asserts in that wise voice of tumbling gravel. "They've seen the world go crazy since they were age two, from JFK's assassination right through Vietnam to the oil mess now. And here the other day for no good reason they blow up this old gent Mountbatten."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Huh," Rabbit grunts, doubting. According to Skeeter the world was never a pleasant place.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Thelma intervenes, saying, "Harry was saying about how Nelson wants to come into the car business with him, and his negative feelings about it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Be the very worst thing you could do for him," Webb says. "I've had five kids, not counting the two tykes Cindy has given me, bless her for it, and when any of them mentioned the roofing business to me I'd say, `Go get a job with another roofer, you'll never learn a thing staying with me.' I couldn't give 'em an order, and if I did they wouldn't obey it anyway. When those kids turned twenty?one, boy or girl, I told each one of them, `It's been nice knowing you, but you're on your own now.' And not one has ever sent me a letter asking for money, or advice, or anything. I get a Christmas card at Christmastime if I'm lucky. One once said to me, Marty the oldest, he said, `Dad, thanks for being such a bastard. It's made me fit for life."'
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry contemplates his empty glass. "Webb, whaddeya think? Should I have another drink or not? It's fourball, you can carry the team."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't do it, Harry, we need you. You're the long knocker. Stay sober."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He obeys, but can't shake his depression, thinking of Nelson. Thanks for being such a bastard. He misses Janice. With her around, his paternity is diluted, something the two of them did together, conniving, half by accident, and can laugh together about. When he contemplates it by himself, bringing a person into the world seems as terrible as pushing somebody into a furnace. By the time they finally get out onto the golf course, green seems a shade of black. Every blade of grass at his feet is an individual life that will die, that has flourished to no purpose. The fairway springy beneath his feet blankets the dead, is the roof of a kingdom where his mother stands at a cloudy sink, her hands red and wearing sleeves of soap bubbles when she lifts them out to give him some sort of warning. Between her thumb and knobby forefinger, the hands not yet badly warped by Parkinson's, a bubble pops. Mountbatten. And this same week their old mailman has died, Mr. Abendroth, a cheerful overweight man with his white hair cut in a whiffle, dead of a thrombosis at sixty?two. Ma Springer had heard about it from the neighbors, he'd been bringing the neighborhood their bills and magazines ever since Harry and Janice had moved in; it had been Mr. Abendroth who had delivered last April that anonymous envelope containing the news that Skeeter was dead. As he held that clipping that day the letters of type like these blades of grass drew Harry's eyes down, down into a blackness between them, as the ribs of a grate reveal the unseen black river rushing in the sewer. The earth is hollow, the dead roam through caverns beneath its thin green skin. A cloud covers the sun, giving the grass a silver sheen. Harry takes out a seven?iron and stands above his ball. Hit down. One of the weaknesses of Harry's game is he cannot make himself take a divot, he tries with misapplied tenderness to skim it off the turf, and hits it thin. This time he hits the ball fat, into a sand bunker this side of the tenth green. Must have rocked forward onto his toes, another fault. His practice swing is always smooth and long but when the pressure is on anxiety and hurry enter in. "You dummy," Ronnie Harrison shouts over at him. "What'd you do that for?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "To annoy you, you creep," Rabbit tells him. In a fourball one of the foursome must do well on every hole or the aggregate suffers. Harry here had the longest drive. Now look at him. He wriggles his feet to root himself in the sand, keeping his weight back on his heels, and makes himself swing through with the wedge, pick it up and swing it through, blind faith, usually he picks it clean in his timidity and flies it over the green but in this instance with his fury at Ronnie and his glum indifference it all works out: the ball floats up on its cushioning spray of sand, bites, and crawls so close to the pin the three others of his foursome cackle and cheer. He sinks the putt to save his par. Still, the game seems long today, maybe it's the gin at noon or the end?of?summer doldrums, but he can't stop seeing the fairways as chutes to nowhere or feel-ing he should be somewhere else, that something has happened, is happening, that he's late, that an appointment has been made for him that he's forgotten. He wonders if Skeeter had this feeling in the pit of his stomach that moment when he decided to pull his gun out and get blasted, if he had that feeling when he woke on the morning of that day. Tired flowers, goldenrod and wild car-rot, hang in the rough. The millions of grass blades shine, ready to die. This is what it all comes to, a piece of paper that itself turns yellow, a news item you cut out and mail to another with no note. File to forget. History carves these caverns with a steady drip?drip. Dead Skeeter roams below, cackling. Time seeps up through the blades of grass like a colorless poison. He is tired, Harry, of sum-mer, of golf, of the sun. When he was younger and just taking up the game twenty years ago and even when he took it up again eight years or so ago there were shots that seemed a miracle, straight as an edge of glass and longer than any power purely his could have produced, and it was for the sake of collaboration with this power that he kept playing, but as he improved and his handi-cap dwindled from sky's?the?limit to a sane sixteen, these supershots became rarer, even the best of his drives had a little tail or were struck with a little scuff, and a shade off line one way or another, and the whole thing became more like work, pleasant work but work, a matter of approximations in the realm of the imperfect, with nothing breaking through but normal healthy happiness. In pursuit of such happiness Harry feels guilty, out on the course as the shadows lengthen, in the company of these three men, who away from their women loom as as boring as they must appear to God.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice is not waiting for him in the lounge or beside the pool when at last around 5:45 they come in from playing the par?5 eighteenth. Instead one of the girls in their green and white uni-forms comes over and tells him that his wife wants him to call home. He doesn't recognize this girl, she isn't Sandra, but she knows his name. Everybody knows Harry at the Flying Eagle. He goes into the lounge, his hand lifted in continuous salute to the members there, and puts the same dime he's been using as a ball marker on the greens into the pay phone and dials. Janice answers after a single ring.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hey come on over," he begs. "We miss you. I played pretty good, the second nine, once I worked a g?and?t out of my sys-tem. With our handicap strokes Webb figures our best ball to be a sixty?one, which ought to be good for an alligator shirt at least. You should have seen my sand shot on the third."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'd like to come over," Janice says, her voice sounding so careful and far away the idea crosses his mind she's being held for ransom and so must be careful what she says, "but I can't. There's somebody here."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Who?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Somebody you haven't met yet."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Important?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She laughs. "I believe so."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why are you being so fucking mysterious?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Harry, just come."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "But there's going to be the banquet, and the prizes. I can't desert my foursome."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "If you won any prize Webb can give it to you later. I can't keep talking forever."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "This better be good," he warns her, hanging up. What can it be? Another accident for Nelson, the police have come for him. The kid has a criminal slouch. Harry goes back to the pool and tells the others, "Crazy Janice says I have to come home but she won't say why."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The women's faces show concern but the men are on their second round of drinks now and feeling no pain. "Hey Harry," Buddy Inglefinger shouts. "Before you go, here's one you might not have heard up in the Poconos. Why did the Russian ballet dancer defect to the U.S.A.?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't know, why?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Because Communism wasn't Goodunov."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The obliging laughter of the three women, as they all gaze upward in the reddening slant sun toward Harry's face, is like some fruit, three different ripenesses on the same branch, still hanging there when he turns his back. Cindy has put on over her bare shoulders a peach?colored silken shirt and in the V of its throat her little gold cross twinkles; he hadn't noticed it when she was nearly naked. He changes out of his golf shoes in the locker room and instead of showering just takes the hanger holding the sports coat and slacks he was going to put on for the banquet out to the parking lot on his arm. The Corona still doesn't feel right. He hears on the radio the Phillies have eked out a victory in Atlanta, 2?1. The gang never mentions the Phillies anymore, they're in fifth place, out of it. Get out of it in this society and you're as good as dead, an embarrassment. Not Goodunov. Keep Our City Clean. The radio announcer is not that wiseass woman but a young man with a voice like bubbles of fat in water, every syllable. Hurricane David has already left six hundred dead in the Caribbean region, he says, and, finally, life may exist, some scientists are coming to believe, on Titan, Saturn's largest moon. Harry passes the old box factory and enjoys yet once again the long view of the town of Mt. Judge you get coming in the Route 422 way. The row houses ascending the slope of the mountain like stairs, their windows golden with setting sun like holes in a Hallowe'en pumpkin. Suppose he had been born on Titan instead, how different would he feel down deep? He thinks of those cindery lunar surfaces, the chunky men in their white suits hopping, the footprints they left in the dust there forever. He remembers how when they'd come visiting the Springers or after the fire the first years they lived here he and Nelson used to watch Lost in Space together on the gray sofa, how they'd squirm and groan when Doctor Smith did some dumb imperilling egotistical thing, and only that manly?voiced robot and the little boy Will with enough sense to pull the thing off, the spaceship fighting free of man?eating plants or whatever the week's villains were. He wonders now if Nelson saw himself as Will, saving the grownups from themselves, and he wonders where the boy actor is now, what he is, Rabbit hopes not a junkie the way so many of these child stars seem to end up. That was good solid space they were lost in, not this soupy psychedelic space they have on TV now, all tricks with music and lights, tricks he associates with the movie 2001, an unpleasant association since that was the time Janice ran off with Charlie and all hell broke loose on the home front. The problem is, even if there is a Heaven how can there be one we can stand forever? On Earth, when you look up from being bored, things have changed, you're that much closer to the grave, and that's exciting. Imagine climbing up and up into that great tree of night sky. Dizzying. Terrible. Rabbit didn't even like to get too high into these little Norway maples around town, though with the other kids as witnesses he pushed himself up, gripping tighter and tighter as the branches got smaller. From a certain angle the most terrifying thing in the world is your own life, the fact that it's yours and nobody else's. A loop is rising in his chest as in a rope when you keep twisting. Whatever can have happened bad enough to make Janice miss the fourball banquet?
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He accelerates along Jackson as the streetlights come on, earlier each day now. Janice's Mustang is out along the curb with the top down, she must have gone somewhere after church, she wouldn't take Bessie to church with the top down. Inside the front door, a wealth of duffel bags and suitcases has been deposited in the living room as by a small army. In the kitchen there is laughter and light. The party comes to meet him halfway, in the shadowy no?man's land between the staircase and the breakfront. Ma Springer and Janice are overtopped by a new female, taller, with a smoothly parted head of hair from which the kitchen light strikes an arc of carrot color, where Melanie's hair would have caught in its curls a straggly halo. He had grown used to Melanie. It is Nelson who speaks. "Dad, this here is Pru," the "this here" a little scared joke.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nelson's fiancée," Janice amplifies in a voice tense but plump, firmly making the best of it.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Is that a fact?" Harry hears himself ask. The young woman saunters forward, a slender slouching shape, and he takes the bony hand she extends. In the lingering daylight that the dining?room windows admit she stands plain, a young redhead past girlhood, with amts too long and hips too wide for the boniness of her face, an awkward beauty, her body helplessly not only hers but somehow theirs, overcommitted, with a look about her of wry, slightly twisted resignation, of having been battered by life young as she is, but the battering having not yet reached her eyes, which are clear green, though guarded. As she entrusts her hand to his her smile is a fraction slow, as if inside she must make certain there is something to smile at, but then comes forth eagerly enough, with a crimp in one comer. She wears a baggy brown sweater and the new looser style of jeans, bleach spattered across the thighs. Her hair, swept back behind her ears to form a single fanning sheaf down her back, looks ironed, it is so straight, and dyed, it is so vivid a pallid red.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I wouldn't say fiancée exactly," Pru says, directly to Harry. "There's no ring, look." She holds up a naked trembling hand.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry in his need to get a fix on this new creature glances from Nelson right through Janice, whom he can grill later in bed, to Ma Springer. Her mouth is clamped shut; if you tapped her she'd ring like a gong, rigid in her purple church dress. Nelson's mouth is ajar. He is a sick man fascinated by the ministration of doctors around him, his illness at last confessed and laid open to cure. In Pru's presence he looks years younger than when Melanie was about, a nervous toughness melted all away. It occurs to Harry that this girl is older than the boy, and another, deeper, instinctive revelation pounds in upon him even as he hears himself saying, as humorous paternal host, "Well in any case it's nice to meet you, Pru. Any friend of Nelson's, we put up with around here." This maybe falls flat, so he adds, "I bet you're the girl's been sending all those letters."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Her eyes glance down, the demure plane of her cheek reddened as if he's slapped her. "Too many I suppose," she says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No bother to me," he assures her, "I'm not the mailman. He recently upped and died, by the way. Not your fault, though."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She lifts her eyes, a flourishing green.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Pru is pregnant. One of the few advantages of not having been born yesterday is that a man acquires, like a notion of tomorrow's weather from the taste of the evening air, some sense of the opposite sex's physiology, its climate. She has less waist than a woman so young should, and that uncanny green clarity of her eyes and a soft slowed something in her motions as she turns away from Harry's joke to take a cue from Nelson bespeak a burden beyond disturbing, a swell beneath the waves. In her third or fourth month, Rabbit guesses. And with this guess a backwards roll of light illumines the months past. And the walls of this house, papered with patterns sunk into them like stains, change meaning, containing this seed between them. The fuzzy gray sofa and the chair that matches and the Barcalounger and the TV set (an Admiral) and Ma Springer's pompous lamps of painted porcelain and tarnished brass and the old framed watercolors sunk to the tint of dust from never being looked at, the table runners Ma once crocheted and her collection of brittle bright knickknacks stored on treble corner shelves nicked and sanded to suggest antique wood but stemming from an era of basement carpentry in Fred Springer's long married life: all these souvenirs of the dead bristle with new point, with fresh mission, if as Harry imagines this intruder's secret is a child to come.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He feels swollen. His guess has been like a fist into him. As was not the case with Melanie he feels kinship with this girl, is touched by her, turned on: he wants to be giving her this baby.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> In bed he asks Janice, "How long have you known?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh," she says, "about a month. Melanie let some of the cat out of the bag and then I confronted Nelson with it. He was relieved to talk, he cried even. He just didn't want you to know."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why not?" He is hurt. He is the boy's father.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice hesitates. "I don't know, I guess he was afraid you'd be mad. Or laugh at him."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why would I laugh at him? The same thing happened to me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He doesn't know that, Harry."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How could he not? His birthday keeps coming around seven months after our anniversary."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well, yes." In her impatience she sounds much like her mother, setting the heel of her voice into each word. The bed creaks as she flounces in emphasis. "Children don't want to know these things, and by the time they're old enough to care it's all so long ago."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "When did he knock the girl up, does he remember that much?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Weren't you funny, guessing so quickly she was in a family way? We weren't going to tell you for a while."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Thanks. It was the first thing that hit me. That baggy sweater. That, and that she's taller than Nelson."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Harry, she isn't. He's an inch taller, he's told me himself, it's just that his posture is so poor."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And how much older is she? You can see she's older."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well, a year or less. She was a secretary in the Registrar's office -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah and why wasn't he fucking another student? What does he have to get mixed up in the secretarial pool for?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Harry, you should talk to them if you want to know every in and out ofit all. You know though how he used to say how phony these college girls were, he never felt comfortable in that atmosphere. He's from business people on my side and working people on yours and there hasn't been much college in his background."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Or in his future from the way it looks."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's not such a bad thing the girl can do a job. You heard her say at supper she'd like him to go back to Kent and finish, and she could take in typing in their apartment."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah and I heard the little snot say he wanted no part of it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You won't get him to go back by shouting at him."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I didn't shout."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You got a look on your face."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well, Jesus. Because the kid gets a girl pregnant he thinks he's entitled to run Springer Motors."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Harry, he doesn't want to run it, he just wants a place in it." "You can't give him a place without taking a place from somebody else."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Mother and I think he should have a place," Janice says, so definitely it seems her mother has spoken, out of the dark air of this bedroom where the old lady's presence was always felt as a rumble of television or a series of snores coming through the wall.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He reverts to his question, "When did he get her pregnant?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, when these things happen, in the spring. She missed her first period in May, but they waited till they got to Colorado to do the urine test. It was positive and Pru told him she wasn't going to get an abortion, she didn't believe in them and too many of her friends had had their insides messed up."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "In this day and age, she said all that."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Also I believe there's Catholicism in her background, on her mother's side."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Still, she looks like she has some common sense."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Maybe it was common sense talking. If she goes ahead and has the baby then Nelson has to do something."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Poor little devil. How come she got pregnant in the first place? Don't they all have the Pill, and loops, and God knows what else now? I was reading in Consumer Reports about these temporary polyurethane tube ties."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Some of these new things are getting a bad name in the papers. They give you cancer."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not at her age they wouldn't. So then she sat out there in the Rocky Mountains hatching this thing while Melanie kept him on a short leash around here."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice is growing sleepy, whereas Harry fears he will be awake forever, with this big redhead out of the blue across the hall. Ma Springer had made it clear she expected Pru to sleep in Melanie's old room and had stomped upstairs to watch The Jeffersons. The old crow had just sat there pretty silent all evening, looking like a boiler with too. much pressure inside. She plays her cards tight. Harry nudges Janice's sleepy soft side to get her talking again.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She says, "Melanie said Nelson became very hard to manage, once the test came back positive ? running around with a bad crowd out there, making Pru take up hang gliding. Then when he saw she wouldn't change her mind all he wanted to do was run back here. They couldn't talk him out of it, he went and quit this good job he had with a man building condominiums. Melanie I guess had some reasons of her own to get away so she invited herself along. Nelson didn't want her to but I guess the alternative was Pru letting her parents and us know what the situation was and instead of that he begged for time, trying to get some kind of nest ready for her here and maybe still hoping it would all go away, I don't know."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Poor little Nelson," Harry says. Sorrow for the child bleeds upward to the ceiling with its blotches of streetlight shuffling through the beech. "This has been Hell for him."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well Melanie's theory was not Hell enough; she didn't like the way he kept going out with Billy Fosnacht and his crowd instead of facing us with the facts and telling us why he really wanted to go to work at the lot."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry sighs. "So when's the wedding?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "As soon as it can be arranged. I mean, it's her fifth month. Even you spotted it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Even you, he resents this, but doesn't want to tell Janice of the instinctive bond he has with this girl. Pru is like his mother, awkward and bony, with big hands, but less plain.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "One of the reasons I took Mother to church this morning was so we could have a word with Reverend Campbell."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That fag? Lordy?O."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Harry you know nothing about him. He's been uncommonly sweet to Mother and he's really done a lot for the parish."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "The little boys' choir especially, I bet."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You are so un?open. Mother with all her limitations is more open than you." She turns her face away and says into her pillow, "Harry, I'm very tired. All this upsets me too. Was there anything else you wanted to ask?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He asks, "Does he love the girl, do you think?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You've seen her. She's striking."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I can see that, but can Nelson? You know they say history repeats but it never does, exactly. When we got married everybody was doing it but now when these kids hang back and just live together it must be a bigger deal. I mean, marriage must be more frightening."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice turns her head back again and offers, "I think it's good, that she's a little older."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well, Nelson needs steadying."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "A girl who gets herself knocked up and then pulls this rightto?life act isn't my idea of steady. What kind of parents does she come from anyway?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "They're just average people in Ohio. I think the father works as a steamfitter."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "A?ha," he says. "Blue collar. She's not marrying Nelson, she's marrying Springer Motors."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Just like you did," Janice says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He should resent this but he likes it, her new sense of herself as a prize. He lays his hand in that soft place where her waist dips. "Listen," he says, "when I married you you were selling salted nuts at Kroll's and my parents thought your dad was a shifty character who was going to wind up in jail."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> But he didn't, he wound up in Heaven. Fred Springer made that long climb into the tree of the stars. Lost in space. Now Janice is following, his touch tipping her into sleep just as he feels below his waist a pulsing that might signal a successful erection. Nothing like the thought of fucking money. He doesn't fuck her enough, his poor dumb moneybags. She has fallen asleep naked. When they were newly married and for years thereafter she wore cotton nighties that made her look like that old?fashioned Time to Retire ad, but sometime in the Seventies she began to come to bed in just her skin, her little still?tidy snake?smooth body brown wherever the tennis dress didn't cover, with a fainter brown belly where that Op?pattern two?piece bathing suit exposed her middle. How quickly Cindy's footprints dried on the flagstones behind her today! The strange thing is he can never exactly picture fucking her, it is like looking into the sun. He turns on his back, frustrated yet relieved to be alone in the quiet night where his mind can revolve all that is new. In middle age you are carrying the world in a sense and yet it seems out of control more than ever, the self that you had as a boy all scattered and distributed like those pieces of bread in the miracle. He had been struck in Kruppenbach's Sunday School by the verse that tells of the clean?up, twelve baskets full of the fragments. Keep Your City Clean. He listens for the sound of footsteps slithering out of Melanie's ? no, Pru's ?room, she'd come a long way today and had met a lot of new faces, what a hard thing for her this evening must have been. While Ma and Janice had scraped together supper, another miracle of sorts, the girl had sat there in the bamboo basket chair brought in from the porch and they all eased around her like cars easing past an accident on the highway. Harry could hardly take his eyes from this grown woman sitting there so demure and alien and perceptibly misshapen. She breathed that air he'd forgotten, of high?school loveliness, come uninvited to bloom in the shadow of railroad overpasses, alongside telephone poles, within earshot of highways with battered aluminum center strips, out of mothers gone to lard and fathers ground down by gray days ofwork and more work, in an America littered with bottlecaps and pull?tabs and pieces ofbroken muffler. Rabbit remembered such beauty, seeing it caught here in Pru, in her long downy arms and skinny bangled wrists and the shining casual fall of her hair, caught as a stick snags the flow of a stream with a dimpled swirl. Janice sighs in her sleep. A car swishes by, the radio trailing disco through the open window. Labor Day Eve, the end of something. He feels the house swell beneath him, invading presences crowding the downstairs, the dead awakened. Skeeter, Pop, Mom, Mr. Abendroth. The photograph of Fred Springer fading on the sideboard fills with the flush of hectic color Fred carried on his cheeks and where the bridge of his nose pressed. Harry buries his mind in the girls of Mt. Judge High as they were in the Forties, the fuzzy sweaters and dimestore pearls, the white blouses that let the beige shadow of the bra show through, the skirts, always skirts, long as gowns when the New Look was new, swinging in the locker?lined halls, and then out along the pipe rail that guarded the long cement wells that let light into the basement windows of the shop and home ec. and music rooms, the long skirts in rows, the saddle shoes and short white socks in rows, the girls exhaling winter breath like cigarette smoke, their pea jackets, nobody wore parkas then, the dark lipstick of those girls, looking all like Rita Hayworth in the old yearbooks. The teasing of their skirts, open above their socks, come find me if you can, the wild fact of pubic hair, the thighs timidly parted in the narrow space of cars, the damp strip of underpants, Mary Ann his first girl, her underpants down around her saddle shoes like an animal trap, the motor running to keep the heater on in Pop's new blue Plymouth, that they let him borrow one night a week in spite of all Mim's complaining and sarcasm. Mim a flat?chested brat until about seventeen when she began to have her own secrets. Between Mary Ann's legs a locker?room humidity and flesh smell turned delicate, entrusted to him. Married another while he was in the Army. Invited another into that secret space of hers, he couldn't believe it. Lost days, buried at the back of his brain, deep inside, gray cells of which millions die every day he has read somewhere, taking his life with them into blackout, his only life, trillions of electric bits they say, makes even the biggest computer look sick: having found and entered again that space he notices his prick has stayed hard and grown harder, the process there all along, little sacs of blood waiting for the right deep part of the brain to come alive again. Left?handedly, on his back so as not to disturb Janice, he masturbates, remembering Ruth. Her room on Summer. The first night, him having run, all that sad craziness with dead Tothero, then the privacy of this room. This island, their four walls, her room. Her fat white body out of her clothes and her poking fun of his jockey underpants. Her arms seemed thin, thin, pulling him down and rising above him, one long underbelly erect in light.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Hey.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Hey.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> You're pretty.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Come on. Work.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He shoves up and comes, the ceiling close above him, his body feeling curved as if tied to a globe that is growing, growing as his seed bucks up against the sheet. More intense than pumping down into darkness. Weird behavior for an old guy. He stealthily slides from the bed and gropes after a handkerchief in a drawer, not wanting the scrape to wake Janice or Ma Springer or this Pru, cunts all around him. Back in bed, having done his best, though it's always queer where the wet is, maybe it doesn't come out when you feel it does, he composes himself for sleep by thinking of his daughter, her pale round face floating in what appeared to be a milky serene disposition. A voice hisses, Hassy.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The Reverend Archie Campbell comes visiting a few nights later, by appointment. He is short and slight, but his voice compensates by being deep and mellow; he enunciates with such casual smiling sonorousness that his sentences seem to keep travelling around a corner after they are pronounced. His head is too big for his body. His lashes are long and conspicuous and he sometimes shuts his eyes as if to display the tremor in his closed lids. He wears his backwards collar with a flimsy black buttonless shirt and a seersucker coat. When he smiles, thick lips like Carter's reveal small even teeth, like seeds in a row, stained by nicotine.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ma Springer offers him a cup of coffee but he says, "Dear me, no thank you, Bessie. This is my third call this evening and any more caffeine intake will positively give me the shakes." The sentence travels around a corner and disappears up Joseph Street.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry says to him, "A real drink then, Reverend. Scotch? A g?and?t? It's still summer officially."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Campbell glances around for their reaction ? Nelson and Pru side by side on the gray sofa, Janice perched on a straight chair brought in from the dining room, Ma Springer uneasy on her legs, her offer of coffee spurned. "Well as a matter offact yes," the minister drawls. "A touch of the sauce might be sheer bliss. Harry, do you have vodka, perchance?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice intervenes, "Way in the back of the corner cupboard, Harry, the bottle with the silver label."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He nods. "Anybody else?" He looks at Pru especially, since in these few days of living with them she's shown herself to be no stranger to the sauce. She likes liqueurs; she and Nelson the other day brought back from a shopping expedition along with the beer sixpacks Kahlúa, Cointreau, and Amaretto di Saronno, chunky little bottles, there must have been between twenty and thirty dollars invested in that stuff. Also they have found in the corner cupboard some créme de menthe left over from a dinner party Harry and Janice gave for the Murketts and Harrisons last February and a little bright green gleam of it appears by Pru's elbow at surprising times, even in the morning, as she and Ma watch Edge of Night. Nelson says he wouldn't turn down a beer. Ma Springer says she's going to have coffee anyway, she even has decaffeinated if the rector would prefer. But Archie sticks to his guns, with a perky little bow of thanks to her and a wink all around. The guy is something of a card, Rabbit can see that. Probably the best way to play it, at this late date A.D. They had figured him for the gray easy chair that matches the sofa, but he foxes them by pulling out the lopsided old Syrian hassock from behind the combination lamp and table, where Ma keeps some of her knickknacks, and squatting down. Thus situated, the minister grins up at them all and, nimble as a monkey, fishes a pipe from his front coat pocket and stuffs its bowl with a brown forefinger.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice gets up and goes with Harry into the kitchen while he makes the drinks. "That's some little pastor you've got there," he tells her softly.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't be snide."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What's snide about that?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Everything." She pours herself some Campari in an orangejuice glass and without comment fills with créme de menthe one of the set of eight little cylindrical liqueur glasses that came as a set with a decanter she had bought at Kroll's years ago, about the same time they joined the Flying Eagle. They hardly ever have used them. When Harry returns to the living room with Campbell's vodka?and?tonic and Nelson's beer and his own g?and?t Janice follows him in and sets this cylinder of gaudy green on the end table next to Pru's elbow. Pru gives no sign of noticing.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Reverend Campbell has persuaded Ma Springer to take the Barcalounger, where Harry had anticipated sitting, and to raise up its padded extension for her legs. "I must say," she says, "that does wonders for the pressure in my ankles."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Thus laid back the old lady looks vulnerable, and absurdly . reduced in importance within the family circle. Janice, seeing her mother stretched out helpless, volunteers, "Mother, I'll fetch you your coffee."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And that plate of chocolate?chip cookies I set out. Though I don't suppose anybody with liquor wants cookies too."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I do, Mom?mom," Nelson says. He wears a different expression since Pru arrived ? the surly clotted look has relaxed into an expectant emptiness, a wide?eyed docility that Harry finds just as irritating.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Since the minister declined to take the gray easy chair, Harry must. As he sinks into it his legs stretch out, and Campbell without rising jumps the hassock and himself together a few feet to one side, like a bullfrog hopping, pad and all, to avoid being touched by Harry's big suede shoes. Grinning at his own agility, the little man resonantly announces, "Well now. I understand somebody here wants to get married."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not me, I'm married already," Rabbit says quickly, as a joke of his own. He has the funny fear that Campbell, one of whose little hands (they look grubby, like his teeth) rests on the edge of the hassock inches from the tips of Harry's shoes, will suddenly reach down and undo the laces. He moves his feet over, some more inches away.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Pru had smiled sadly at his joke, gazing down, her green?filled glass as yet untouched. Seated beside her, Nelson stares forward, solemnly unaware of the dabs of beer on his upper lip. A baby eating: Rabbit remembers how Nelson used to batter with the spoon, held left?handed in his fist though they tried to get him to take it in his right, on the tray of the high chair in the old apartment on Wilbur Street, high above the town. He was never one of the messier babies, though ? always wanting to be good. Harry wants to cry, gazing at the innocently ignored mustache of foam on the kid's face. They're selling him down the river. Pru touches her glass furtively, without giving it aglance.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ma Springer's voice sounds weary, rising from the Barcalounger. "Yes they'd like to have it be in the church, but it won't be one of your dressy weddings. Just family. And as soon as convenient, even next week we were thinking." Her feet in their dirty aqua sneakers, with rounded toes and scuffed rims of white rubber, look childish and small off the floor, up on the padded extension.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice's voice sounds hard, cutting in. "Mother there's no need for such a rush. Pru's parents will need time to make arrangements to come from Ohio."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Her mother says, with a flip of her tired hand toward Pru, "She says her folks may not be bothering to come."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The girl blushes, and tightens her touch on the glass, as if to pick it up when attention has moved past her. "We're not as close as this family is," she says. She lifts her eyes, with their translucent green, to the face of the minister, to explain, "I'm one of seven. Four of my sisters are married already, and two of those marriages are on the rocks. My father's sour about it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ma Springer explains, "She was raised Catholic."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The minister smiles broadly. "Prudence seems such a Protestant name."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The blush, as if quickened by a fitful wind, deepens again. "I was baptized Teresa. My friends in high school used to think I was prudish, that's where Pru came from."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Campbell giggles. "Really! That's fascinating!" The hair on the top of his head, Rabbit sees, is getting thin, young as he is. Thank God that's one aspect of aging Harry doesn't have to worry about: good lasting heads of hair on both sides of his family, though Pop's toward the end had gone through gray to yellow, finer than cornsilk, and too dry to comb. They say the mother's genes determine. One of the things he never liked about Janice was her high forehead, like she might start to go bald. Nelson's too young to tell yet. Old man Springer used to slick his hair back so he always looked like a guy in a shirt collar ad, even on Saturday mornings, and in the coffin they got the parting all wrong; the newspaper obituary had reversed the photo in doing the halftone and the mortician had worked from that. With Mim, one of the first signs of her rebellion as he remembers was she bleached stripes into her hair, "Protestant rat" she used to call the natural color, in tenth grade, and Mom would get after her saying, "Better that than look like a skunk." It was true, with those blonde pieces Mim did look tough, suddenly ? besmirched. That's life, besmirching yourself. The young clergyman's voice is sliding from syllable to syllable smoothly, his surprising high giggle resettled in the back of his throat. "Bessie, before we firm up particulars like the date and the guest list, I think we should investigate some basics. Nelson and Teresa: do you love one another, and are you both prepared to make the ?eternal commitment that the church understands to exist at the heart of Christian marriage?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The question is a stunner. Pru says "Yes" in a whisper and takes the first sip from her glass of créme de menthe.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson looks so glazed his mother prompts, "Nelson."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He wipes his mouth and whines, "I said I'd do it, didn't I? I've been here all summer trying to work things out. I'm not going back to school, I'll never graduate now, because of this. What more do you people want?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> All flinch into silence but Harry, who says, "I thought you didn't like Kent."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I didn't, much. But I'd put in my time and would just as soon have gotten the degree, for what it's worth, which isn't much. All summer, Dad, you kept bugging me about college and I wanted to say, O.K., O.K., you're right, but you didn't know the story, you didn't know about Pru."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't marry me then," Pru says quickly, quietly.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The boy looks sideways at her on the sofa and sinks lower into the cushions. "I'd just as soon," he says. "It's time I got serious."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "We can get married and still go back for a year and have you finish." Pru has transferred her hands to her lap and with them the little glass of green; she gazes down into it and speaks steadily, as if she is drawing up out of its tiny well words often rehearsed, her responses to Nelson's complaints.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Naa," Nelson says, shamed. "That seems silly. If I'm gonna be married, let's really do it, with a job and clunky old station wagon and a crummy ranch house and all that drill. There's nothing I can get at Kent'll make me better at pushing Dad's little Japanese kiddy cars off on people. If Mom and Mom?mom can twist his arm so he'll take me in."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Jesus, how you distort!" Harry cries. "We'll all take you in, how can we help but? But you'd be worth a helluva lot more to the company and what's more to yoursef if you'd finish up at college. Because I keep saying this I'm treated around here like a monster." He turns to Archie Campbell, forgetting how low the man is sitting and saying over his head, "Sorry about all this chitchat, it's hardly up your alley."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No," the young man mellifluously disagrees, "it's part of the picture." Of Pru he asks, "What would be your preference, of where to live for the coming year? The first year of married life, all the little books say, sets the tone for all the rest."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> With one hand Pru brushes back her long hair from her shoulders as if angry. "I don't have such happy associations with Kent," she allows. "I'd be happy to begin in a fresh place."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Campbell's pipe is filling the room with a sweetish tweedy perfume. Probably less than thirty and there's nothing they can throw at him that he hasn't fielded before. A pro: Rabbit can respect that. But how did he let himself get queer?
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ma Springer says in a spiteful voice, "You may wonder now why they don't wait that year."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The small man's big head turns and he beams. "No, I hadn't wondered at that."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She's got herself in a family way," the old lady declares, needlessly.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "With Nelson's help, of course," the minister smiles.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice tries to intervene: "Mother, these things happen."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ma snaps back, "Don't tell me. I haven't forgotten it happened to you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Mother."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "This is horrible," Nelson announces from the sofa. "What'd we drag this poor guy in here for anyway? Pru and I didn't ask to be married in a church, I don't believe any of that stuff anyway."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You don't?" Harry is shocked, hurt.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No, Dad. When you're dead, you're dead."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You are?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Come off it, you know you are, everybody knows it down deep."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nobody knows for sure," Pru points out in a quiet voice.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson asks her furiously, "How many dead people have you seen?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Even as a child, Harry remembers, Nelson's face would get white around the gills when he was angry. He would get nervous stomach aches, and clutch at the edge of the banister on his way upstairs to get his books. They would send him off to school anyway. Harry still had his job at Verity and Janice was working part?time at the lot and they had no babysitter. School was the babysitter.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Reverend Campbell, puffing unrufed on his aromatic pipe, asks Pru another question. "How do your parents feel about your being married outside of the Roman faith?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> That tender blush returns, deepening the green of her eyes. "Only my mother was a Catholic actually, and I think by the time I came along she had pretty much given up. I was baptized but never confirmed, though there was this confirmation dress my sisters had worn. Daddy had beaten it out of her I guess you could say. He didn't like having all the children to feed."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What was his denomination?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He was a nothing."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry remembers out loud, "Nelson's grandfather came from a Catholic background. His mother was Irish. My dad's side, I'm talking about. Hell, what I think about religion is -'
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> All eyes are upon him.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "? is without a little of it, you'll sink."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Saying this, he gazes toward Nelson, mostly because the child's vivid pale?gilled face falls at the center of his field of vision. That muskrat haircut: it suggests to Harry a convict's shaved head that has grown out. The boy sneers. "Well don't sink, Dad, whatever you do."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice leans forward to speak to Pru in that mannerly mature woman's bosomy voice she can produce now. "I wish you could persuade your parents to come to the wedding."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ma Springer says, trying a more placating tone, since she has got the minister here and the conference is not delivering for her, "Around here the Episcopalians are thought the next thing to the Catholics anyway."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Pru shakes her head, her red hair flicking, a creature at bay. She says, "My parents and I don't talk much. They didn't approve of something I did before I met Nelson, and they wouldn't approve of this, the way I am now."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What did you do?" Harry asks.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She doesn't seem to have heard, saying as if to herself, "I've learned to take care of myself without them."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'll say this," Campbell says pleasantly, his pipe having gone dead and its relighting having occupied his attention for the last minute. "I'm experiencing some difficulty wrapping my mind around" ? the phrase brings out his mischievous grin, stretched like that guy's on Mad ? "performing a church ceremony for two persons one of whom belongs to the Church of Rome and the other, he has just told us, is an atheist." He gives a nod to Nelson. "Now the bishop gives us more latitude in these matters than we used to have. The other day I married a divorced Japanese man, but with an Episcopal background, to a young woman who originally wanted the words `Universal Mother' substituted for `God' in the service. We talked her out of that. But in this case, good people, I really don't see much indication that Nelson and his very charming fiancée are at all prepared for, or desirous of, what you might call our brand of magic." He releases a great cloud of smoke and closes his lips in that prissy satisfied way of pipe?smokers, waiting to be contradicted.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ma Springer is struggling as if to rise from the Barcalounger. "Well no grandson of Fred Springer is going to get married in a Roman Catholic church!" Her head falls back on the padded headrest. Her gills look purple.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh," Archie Campbell says cheerfully. "I don't think my dear friend Father McGahern could handle them either. The young lady was never even confirmed. You know," he adds, knitting his hands at one knee and gazing into space, "a lot of wonderful, dynamic marriages have been made in City Hall. Or a UnitarianUniversalist service. My friend Jim Hancock of the fellowship in Maiden Springs has more than once taken some of our problem betrothals."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit jumps up. Something awful is being done here, he doesn't know exactly what, or to whom. "Anybody besides me for another drink?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Without looking at Harry, Campbell holds out a glass which has become empty, as has Pru's little glass of créme de menthe. The green of it has all gone into her eyes. The minister is telling her, and Nelson, "Truly, under some circumstances, even for the most devout it can be the appropriate recourse. At a later date, the wedding can be consecrated in a church; we see a number now of these reaffirmations of wedding vows."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why don't they just keep living in sin right here?" Harry asks. "We don't mind."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "We do indeed," Ma says, sounding smothered.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hey Dad," Nelson calls, "could you bring me another beer?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Get it yourself. My hands are full." Yet he stops in front of Pru and takes up the little liqueur glass. "Sure it's good for the baby?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She looks up with an unexpected coldness. He was feeling so fatherly and fond and from her eyes he is a dumb traffic cop. "Oh her eyes yes," she tells him. "It's the beer and wine that are bad; they bloat you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> By the time Rabbit returns from the kitchen, Campbell is allowing himself to be brought around. He has what they want: a church wedding, a service acceptable in the eyes of the Grace Stuhls of this world. Knowing this, he is in no hurry. Beneath the girlish lashes his eyes are as dark as Janice's and Ma's, the Koerner eyes. Ma Springer is holding forth, the little rounded toes of her aqua sneakers bouncing. "You must take what the boy says with a grain of salt. At his age I didn't know what I believed myself, I thought the government was foolish and the gangsters had the right idea. This was back in Prohibition days."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson looks at her with his own dark eyes, sullen. "Mommom, if it matters so much to you, I don't care that much, one way or another."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What does Pru think?" Harry asks, giving her her poison. He wonders if the girl's frozen stiffness of manner, and those little waits while her smile gets unstuck, aren't simply fear: it is she who is growing another life within her body, and nobody else.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I think," she responds slowly, so quietly the room goes motionless to hear, "it would be nicer in a church."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson says, "I know I sure don't want to go down to that awful new concrete City Hall they've built behind where the Bijou used to be, some guy I know was telling me the contractor raked off a million and there's cracks in the cement already."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice in her relief says, "Harry, I could use some more Campari."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Campbell lifts his replenished glass from his low place on the hassock. "Cheers, good people." He states his terms: "The customary procedure consists of at least three sessions of counseling and Christian instruction after the initial interview. This I suppose we can consider the interview." As he addresses Nelson particularly, Harry hears a seductive note enrich the great mellow voice. "Nelson, the church does not expect that every couple it marries be a pair of Christian saints. It does ask that the participants have some understanding of what they are undertaking. I don't take the vows; you and Teresa do. Marriage is not merely a rite; it is a sacrament, an invitation from God to participate in the divine. And the invitation is not for one moment only. Every day you share is meant to be sacramental. Can you feel a meaning in that? There were wonderful words in the old prayer book; they said that marriage was not `to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly; but reverently, discreetly, advisedly, soberly, and in the fear of God.' " He grins, having intoned this, and adds, "The new prayer book omits the fear of God."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson whines, "I said, I'd go along."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice asks, a little prim, "How long would these sessions of instructions take?" It is like she is sitting, in that straight?backed dining?room chair, on an egg that might hatch too soon.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh," Campbell says, rolling his eyes toward the ceiling, "I should think, considering the various factors, we could get three of them in in two weeks. I just happen, the officious clergyman said, to have my appointment book here." Before reaching into the breast pocket of the seersucker coat, Campbell taps out the bowl of his pipe with a finicky calm that conveys to Harry the advantages of being queer: the world is just a gag to this guy. He walks on water; the mud of women and making babies never dirties his shoes. You got to take off your hat: nothing touches him. That's real religion.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Some rebellious wish to give him a poke, to protest the smooth bargain that has been struck, prompts Harry to say, "Yeah, we want to get 'em in before the baby comes. He'll be here by Christmas."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "God willing," Campbell smiles, adding, "He or she."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "January," Pru says in a whisper, after putting down her glass. Harry can't tell if she is pleased or displeased by the gallant way he keeps mentioning the baby that everybody else wants to ignore. While the appointments are being set up she and Nelson sit on that sofa like a pair of big limp Muppets, with invisible arms coming up through the cushions into their torsos and heads.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Fred had his birthday in January," Ma Springer announces, grunting as she tries to get out of the Barcalounger, to see the minister off.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh Mother," Janice says. "One twelfth of the world has January birthdays."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I was born in January," Archie Campbell says, rising. He grins to show his seedy teeth. "In my case, after much prayerful effort. My parents were ancient. It's a wonder I'm here at all."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The next day a warm rain is beginning to batter the yellowing leaves down from the trees in the park along Cityview Drive as Harry and Nelson drive through Brewer to the lot. The kid is still persona non grata but he's asked to check on the two convertibles he crunched, one of which, the Royale, Manny is repairing. The '72 Mercury, hit twice from the side, was more severely damaged, and parts are harder to get. Rabbit's idea had been when the kid went off to school to sell it for junk and write off the loss. But he didn't have the heart not to let the boy look at the wrecks at least. Then Nelson is going to borrow the Corona and visit Billy Fosnacht before he goes back to Boston to become an endodontist. Harry had a root canal job once; it felt like they were tickling the underside of his eyeball. What a hellish way to make a living. Maybe there's no entirely good way. The Toyota's windshield wipers keep up a steady rubbery singsong as the Brewer traffic slows, brake lights burning red all along Locust Boulevard. The Castle has started up again and yellow school buses loom ahead in the jam. Harry switches the wipers from Fast to Intermittent and wishes he still smoked cigarettes. He wants to talk to the kid.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nelson."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Unhh?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How do you feel?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "O.K. I woke up with a soreness in my throat but I took two of those five?hundred?milligram vitamin Cs Melanie talked Bessie into getting."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She was really a health nut, wasn't she? Melanie. We still have all that Granola in the kitchen."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah, well. It was part of her act. You know, mystical gypsy. She was always reading this guru, I forget his name. It sounded like a sneeze."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You miss her?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Melanie? No, why would I?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Weren't you kind of close?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson avoids the implied question. "She was getting pretty grouchy toward the end."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You think she and Charlie went off together?" _ "Beats me," the boy says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The wipers, now on Intermittent, startle Rabbit each time they switch across, as if someone other than he is making decisions in this car. A ghost. Like in that movie about Encounters of the Third Kind the way the truck with Richard Dreyfuss in it begins to shake all over and the headlights behind rise up in the air instead of pulling off to one side. He readjusts the knob from Intermittent to Slow. "I didn't mean your physical health, exactly. I meant more your state of mind. After last night."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You mean about that sappy minister? I don't mind going over to listen to his garbage a couple times if it'll satisfy the Springer honor or whatever."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I guess I mean more about the marriage in general. Nellie, I don't want to see you railroaded into anything."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The boy sits up a little in the side of Harry's vision; the yellow buses ahead pull into the Brewer High driveway and the line of cars begins to move again, slowly, beside a line of parked cars whose rooftops are spattered with leaves the rain has brought down. "Who says I'm being railroaded?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nobody says it. Pru seems a fine girl, if you're ready for marriage."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You don't think I'm ready. You don't think I'm ready for anything."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He lets the hostility pass, trying to talk meditatively, like Webb Murkett. "You know, Nelson, I'm not sure any man is ever a hundred per cent ready for marriage. I sure as hell know I wasn't, from the way I acted toward your mother."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah, well," the boy says, in a voice a little crumbled, from his father's not taking the bait. "She got her own back."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I never could hold that against her. Or Charlie either. You ought to understand. After we got back together that time, we've both been pretty straight. We've even had a fair amount of fun together, in our dotage. I'm just sorry we had so much working out to do, with you still on the scene."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah, well." Nelson's voice sounds breathy and tight, and he keeps looking at his knees, even when Harry hangs that tricky left turn onto Eisenhower Avenue. The boy clears his throat and volunteers, "It's the times, I guess. A lot of the kids I got to know at Kent, they had horror stories worse than any of mine."
<br>

<br> 
<br> "Except that thing with Jill. They couldn't top that, I bet." He doesn't quite chuckle. Jill is a sacred name to the boy; he will never talk about it. Harry goes on clumsily, as the car gains momentum downhill and the spic and black kids strolling uphill to school insolently flirt with danger, daring him to hit them, his fenders brushing their bodies, "There's something that doesn't feel right to me in this new development. The girl gets knocked up, O.K., it takes two to tango, you have some responsibility there, nobody can deny it. But then as I understand it she flat out refuses to get the abortion, when one of the good things that's come along in twenty years along with a lot that's not so good is you can go have an abortion
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> now right out in the open, in a hospital, safe and clean as having your appendix out."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> So?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "So why didn't she?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The boy makes a gesture that Rabbit fears might be an attempt to grab the wheel; his grip tightens. But Nelson is merely waving to indicate a breadth of possibilities. "She had a lot of reasons. I forget what all they were."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'd like to hear them."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well for one thing she said she knew of women who had their insides all screwed up by abortions, so they could never have a baby. You say it's easy as an appendix but you've never had it done. She didn't believe in it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I thought she wasn't that much of a Catholic."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She wasn't, she isn't, but still. She said it wasn't natural."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What's natural? In this day and age with all these contraceptives getting knocked up like that isn't natural."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well she's shy, Dad. They don't call her Pru for nothing. Going to a doctor like that, and having him scrape you out, she just didn't want to do it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You bet she didn't. Shy. She wanted to have a baby, and she wasn't too shy to manage that. How much younger're you than she?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "A year. A little more. What does it matter? It wasn't just a baby she wanted to have, it was my baby. Or so she said."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's sweet. I guess. What did you think about it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I thought it was O.K., probably. It was her body. That's what they all tell you now, it's their body. I didn't see much I could do about it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Then it's sort of her funeral, isn't it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How do you mean?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I mean," Harry says, in his indignation honking at some kids at the intersection of Plum Street who saunter right out toward him, this early in the school year the crossing guards aren't organized yet, "so she decides to keep pregnant till there's no correcting it while this other girl babysits for you, and your mother and grandmother and now this nance of a minister all decide when and how you're going to marry the poor broad. I mean, where do you come in? Nelson Angstrom. I mean, what do you want? Do you know?" In his frustration he hits the rim of the steering wheel with the heel of his hand, as the avenue dips down beneath the blackened nineteenth?century stones of the underpass at Eisenhower and Seventh, that in a bad rainstorm is flooded but not today. The arch of this underpass, built without a keystone, by masons all long dead, is famous, and from his earliest childhood has reminded Rabbit of a crypt, of death. They emerge among the drooping wet pennants of low?cost factory outlets.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well, I want -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Fearing the kid is going to say he wants a job at Springer Motors, Harry interrupts: "You look scared, is all I see. Scared to say, No to any of these women. I've never been that great at saying No either, but just because it runs in the family doesn't mean you have to get stuck. You don't necessarily have to lead my life, I guess is what I want to say."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Your life seems pretty comfy to me, frankly." They turn down Weiser, the forest of the inner?city mall a fogged green smear in the rearview mirror.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah, well," Harry says, "it's taken me a fair amount of time to get there. And by the time you get there you're pooped. The world," he tells his son, "is full of people who never knew what hit 'em, their lives are over before they wake up."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Dad, you keep talking about yourself but I don't see what it has to do with me. What can I do with Pru except marry her? She's not so bad, I mean I've known enough girls to know they all have their limits. But she's a person, she's a friend. It's as if you want to deny her to me, as if you're jealous or something. The way you keep mentioning her baby."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> This kid should have been spanked at some point. "I'm not jealous, Nelson. Just the opposite. I feel sorry for you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't feel sorry for me. Don't waste your feelings on me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> They pass Schoenbaum Funeral Directors. Nobody out front in this rain. Harry swallows and asks, "Don't you want out, if we could rig it somehow?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How could we rig it? She's in her fifth month."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She could go ahead have the baby without you marrying her. These adoption agencies are crying for white babies, you'd be doing somebody else a favor."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Pru would never consent."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't be too sure. We could ease the pain. She's one of seven, she knows the value of a dollar."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Dad, this is crazy talk. You're forgetting this baby is a person. An Angstrom!"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Jesus, how could I forget that?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The light at the foot of Weiser, before the bridge, is red. Harry looks over at his son and gets an impression of something freshly hatched, wet and not quite unfolded. The light turns green. A bronze plaque on a pillar of pebbled concrete names the mayor for whom the bridge was named but it is raining too hard to read it.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He starts up again, "Or you could just, I don't know, not make any decision, just disappear for a while. I'd give you the money for that."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Money, you're always offering me money to stay away."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Maybe because when I was your age I wanted to get away and I couldn't. I didn't have the money. I didn't have the sense. We tried to send you away to get some sense and you've thumbed your nose at it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I haven't thumbed my nose, it's just that there's not that much out there. It isn't what you think, Dad. College is a rip?off, the professors are teaching you stuff because they're getting paid to do it, not because it does you any good. They don't give a fuck about geography or whatever any more than you do. It's all phony, they're there because parents don't want their kids around the house past a certain age and sending them to college makes them look good. `My little Johnny's at Haavahd.' `My little Nellie's at Kent."'
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Really, that's how you see it? In my day kids wanted to get out in the world. We were scared but not so scared we kept running back to Mama. And Grandmama. What're you going to do when you run out of women to tell you what to do?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Same thing you'll do. drop dead."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> D I S C O. DATSUN. FUEL ECONOMY. Route 111 has a certain beauty in the rain, the colors and the banners and the bluish asphalt of the parking lots all run together through the swish of traffic, the beat of wipers. Rubbery hands flailing, Help, help. Rabbit has always liked rain, it puts a roof on the world. "I just don't like seeing you caught," he blurts out to Nelson. "You're too much me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson gets loud. "I'm not you! I'm not caught!"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nellie, you're caught. They've got you. and you didn't even squeak. I hate to see it, is all. All I'm trying to say is, as far as I'm concerned you don't have to go through with it. If you want to get out of it, I'll help you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't want to be helped that way! I like Pru. I like the way she looks. She's great in bed. She needs me, she thinks I'm neat. She doesn't think I'm a baby. You say I'm caught but I don't feel caught, I feel like I'm becoming a man!"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Help, help.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Good," Harry says then. "Good luck."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Where I want your help, Dad, you won't give it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Where's that?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Here. Stop making it so hard for me to fit in at the lot."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> They turn into the lot. The tires of the Corona splash in the gutter water rushing toward its grate along the highway curb. Stonily Rabbit says nothing.
