His own mother took a turn for the worse in December ? her whole left side feels numb, so even with a cane it frightens her to walk ? and as Charlie predicted his cousin Gloria went back to Norristown and her husband, though Charlie wouldn't give it a year; so he has been pretty well tied down. This time it's Harry who's come back with a tan. He gives Charlie a two?handed handclasp, he's so happy to see him at Springer Motors again. The Greek sales rep doesn't look that hot, however: those trips to Florida were like a paint job. He looks pale. He looks as if you pricked his skin he'd bleed gray. He stand hunched over protecting his chest like he'd smoked three packs a day all his life, though Charlie like most Mediterranean types has never really had the self?destructive habits you see in northern Europeans and Negroes. Harry wouldn't have given him such an all?out handshake this way a week ago, but since fucking Thelma up the ass he's felt freer, more in love with the world again.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "The old mastoras. You look great," he exuberantly lies to Charlie.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I've felt better," Charlie tells him. "Thank God it hasn't been any kind of a winter so far." Harry can see, through the plate?glass window, a snowless, leafless landscape, the dust of all seasons swirling and drifting, intermixed with the paper refuse from the Chuck Wagon that has blown across Route 111. A new banner is up: THE ERA OF COROLLA. Toyota = Total Economy. Charlie volunteers, "It's pretty damn depressing, watching Manna mou head straight downhill. She gets out of bed just to go to the bathroom and keeps telling me I ought to get married."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Good advice, maybe."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well, I made a little move on Gloria in that direction, and it may be what scared her back to her husband. That guy, what a shit. She'll be back."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Wasn't she a cousin?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "All the better. Peppy type. About four eleven, little heavy in the rumble seat, not quite classy enough for you, champ. But cute. You should see her dance. I hadn't been to those Hellenic Society Saturday nights for years, she talked me into it. I loved to watch her sweat."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You say she'll be back."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah but not for me. I've missed that boat." He adds, "I've missed a lot of boats."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Who hasn't?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Charlie rolls a toothpick in the center of his lower lip. Harry doesn't like to look at him closely; he's become one of those old Brewer geezers who go into cigar stores to put ten dollars on the numbers and hang around the magazine racks waiting for a conversation. "You've caught a few," he ventures to tell Harry.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No, listen. Charlie. I'm in rotten shape. A kid who's disappeared and a new house with no furniture in it." Yet these facts, species of emptiness and new possibility, excite and please him more than not.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "The kid'll turn up," Charlie says. "He's just letting off steam."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's what Pru says. You never saw anybody so calm, considering. We went up to the hospital last night after getting in from the islands and, Jesus, is she happy about that baby. You'd think she was the first woman in the history of the world to pull this off. I guess she was worried about the kid being normal, after that fall she took a while ago."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Worried about herself, more likely. Girl like that who's been knocked around a lot by life, having a baby's the one way they can prove to themselves they're human. What're they thinking of calling it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She doesn't want to call it after her mother, she wants to name it after Ma. Rebecca. But she wants to wait to hear from Nelson, because, you know, that was his sister's name. The infant that, you know, didn't make it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah." Charlie understands. Inviting bad luck. The sound of Mildred Kroust's typewriter bridges their silence. In the shop one of Manny's men is pounding an uncooperative piece of metal. Charlie asks, "What're you going to do about the house?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Move in, Janice says. She surprised me, the way she talked to her mother. Right in the car driving home. She told her she was welcome to move in with us but she didn't see why she couldn't have a house of her own like other women her age and since Pru and the baby were obviously going to have to stay she doesn't want her to feel crowded in her own home. Bessie, that is."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Huh. About time Jan stood on her own two feet. Wonder who she's been talking to?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Webb Murkett, it occurs to Harry, through a tropical night of love; but things always work best between him and Charlie when they don't go too deep into Janice. He says, "The trouble with having the house is we have no furniture of our own. And everything costs a fucking fortune. A simple mattress and box spring and steel frame to set it on for six hundred dollars; if you add a headboard that's another six hundred. Carpets! Three, four thousand for a little Oriental, and they all come out of Iran and Afghanistan. The salesman was telling me they're a better investment than gold."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Gold's doing pretty well," Charlie says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Better than we are, huh? Have you had a chance to look at the books?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "They've looked better," Charlie admits. "But nothing a little more inflation won't cure. Young couple came in here Tuesday, the first day I got the call from Bessie, and bought a Corvette convertible Nelson had laid in. Said they wanted a convertible and thought the dead of winter would be a good time to buy one. No trade?in, weren't interested in financing, paid for it with a check, a regular checking account. Where do they get the money? Neither one of 'em could have been more than twenty?five. Next day, yesterday, kid came in here in a GMC pick?up and said he'd heard we had a snowmobile for sale. It took us a while to find it out back but when we did he got that light in his eyes so I began by asking twelve hundred and we settled at nine seventy?five. I said to him, There isn't any snow, and he said, That's all right, he was moving up to Vermont, to wait out the nuclear holocaust. Said Three?Mile Island really blew his mind. D'y'ever notice how Carter can't say `nuclear'? He says `nookier.' "
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You really got rid of that snowmobile? I can't believe it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "People don't care about economizing anymore. Big Oil has sold capitalism down the river. What the czar did for the Russians, Big Oil is doing for us."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry can't take the time to talk economics today. He apologizes, "Charlie, I'm still on vacation in theory, to the end of the week, and Janice is meeting me downtown, we got a thousand things to do in connection with this damn house of hers."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Charlie nods. "Amscray. I got some sorting out to do myself. One thing nobody could accuse Nelson of is being a neatness 'freak." He shouts after Harry as he goes into the corridor for his hat and coat, "Say hello to Grandma for me!"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Meaning Janice, Harry slowly realizes.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He ducks into his office, where the new 1980 company calendar with its photo of Fujiyama hangs on the wall. He makes a mental note to himself, not for the first time, to do something about those old clippings that hang outside on the pressed-board partition, they're getting too yellow, there's a process he's heard about where they photograph old halftones so they look white as new, and can be blown up to any size. Might as well blow them up big, it's a business expense. He takes from old man Springer's heavy oak coat?rack with its four little bow legs the sheepskin overcoat Janice got him for Christmas and the little narrow?brim suede hat that goes with it. At his age you wear a hat. He went all through last winter without a cold, because he had taken to wearing a hat. And vitamin C helps. Next it'll be Geritol. He hopes he didn't cut Charlie short but he found talking to him today a little depressing, the guy is at a dead end and turning cranky. Big Oil doesn't know any more what's up than Little Oil. But then from Harry's altitude at this moment anyone might look small and cranky. He has taken off, he is flying high, on his way to an island in his life. He takes a tube of Life Savers (Butter Rum) from his top lefthand desk drawer, to sweeten his breath in case he's kissed, and lets himself out through the back of the shop. He is careful with the crash bar: a touch of grease on this sheepskin and there's no getting it off.

<br> *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson having stolen his Corona, Harry has allocated to himself a grape?blue Celica Supra, the "ultimate Toyota," with padded dash, electric tachometer, state?of?the?art four?speaker solid?state AM/FM/MPX stereo, quartz?accurate digital clock, automatic overdrive transmission, cruise control, computer?tuned suspension, ten?inch disc brakes on all four wheels, and quartz halogen hi?beam headlights. He loves this smooth machine. The Corona for all its dependable qualities was a stodgy little bug, whereas this blue buzzard has charisma. The blacks along lower Weiser really stared yesterday afternoon when he drove it home. After Janice and he had brought Ma back to 89 Joseph in the Chrysler (which in fact even Harry found not so easy to steer, after a week of being driven in taxis on the wrong side of the road), they put her to bed and came into town in the Mustang, Janice all hyper after her standing up for herself about the house, to Schaechner Furniture, where they looked at beds and ugly easy chairs and Parsons tables like the Murketts had, only not so nice as theirs, the wood grain not checkerboarded. They couldn't make any decisions; when the store was about to close she drove him over to the lot so he could have a car too. He picked this model priced in five digits. Blacks stared out from under the neon Signs, JIMBO's Friendly LOUNGE and LIVE ENTERTAINMENT and ADULT ADULT ADULT, as he slid by in virgin blue grapeskin; he was afraid some of them lounging in the cold might come running out at a stoplight and scratch his hood with a screwdriver or smash his windshield with a hammer, taking vengeance for their lives. On a number of walls now in this part of town you can see spray?painted SKEETER LIVES, but they don't say where.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He has lied to Charlie. He doesn't have to meet Janice until one?thirty and it is now only 11:17 by the Supra's quartz clock. He is driving to Galilee. He turns on the radio and its sound is even punkier, richer, more many?leaved and many?layered, than that of the radio in the old Corona. Though he moves the dial from left to right and back again he can't find Donna Summer, she went out with the Seventies. Instead there is a guy singing hymns, squeezing the word "Jesus" until it drips. And that kind of mellow mixed?voice backup he remembers from the records when he was in high school: the jukeboxes where you could see the record fall and that waxy rustling cloth, organdy or whatever, the girls went to dances in, wearing the corsage you gave them. The corsage would get crushed as the dancing got closer and the girls' perfumes would be released from between their powdery breasts as their bodies were warmed and pressed by partner after partner, in the violet light of the darkened gym, crépe?paper streamers drooping overhead and the basketball hoops wreathed with paper flowers, all those warm bodies softly bumping in anticipation of the cold air stored in cars outside, the little glowing dashboard ?lights, the body heat misting the inside of the windshield, the organdy tugged and mussed, chilly fingers fumbling through coats and pants and underpants, clothes become a series of tunnels, Mary Ann's body nestling toward his hands, the space between her legs so different and mild and fragrant and safe, a world apart. And now, the news, on the half hour. That wise?voiced young woman is long gone from this local station, Harry wonders where she is by now, doing go?go or assistant vice?president at Sunflower Beer. The new announcer sounds like Billy Fosnacht, fat?upped. President Carter has revealed that he personally favors a boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Reaction from athletes is mixed. Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi has backed off from yesterday's apparently pro?Soviet stance on Afghanistan. On the crowded campaign trail, U.S. Representative Philip Crane of Illinois has labelled as "foolish" Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy's proposal that the Seabrook, New Hampshire, proposed nuclear plant be converted to coal. In Japan, former Beatle Paul McCartney was jailed on charges of possessing eight ounces of marijuana. In Switzerland, scientists have succeeded in programming bacteria to manufacture the scarce human protein interferon, an anti?viral agent whose artificial production may usher in an era as beneficial to mankind as the discovery of penicillin. Meanwhile, if the fillings in your teeth cost more, it's because the price of gold hit eight hundred dollars an ounce in New York City today. Fuck. He sold too soon. Eight hundred times thirty equals twenty?four thousand, that's up nearly ten grand from fourteen six, if he'd just held on, damn that Webb Murkett and his silver. And the 76ers continue their winning ways, 121 to 110 over the Portland Trail Blazers at the Spectrum last night. Poor old Eagles out of their misery, Jaworski went down flinging. And now, to continue our program of Nice Music for Nice Folks, the traditional melody "Savior, Keep a Watch Over Me." Harry turns it off, driving to the purr of the Supra.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He knows the way now. Past the giant Amishman pointing to the natural cave, through the narrow town with its Purina feedstore sign and old inn and new bank and hitching posts and tractor agency. The corn stubble of the fields sticks up pale, all the gold bleached from it. The duck pond has frozen edges but a wide center of black water, so mild has the winter been. He slows past the Blankenbiller and Muth mailboxes, and turns down the driveway where the box says BYER. His nerves are stretched so nothing escapes his vision, the jutting stones of the two beaten reddish tracks that make the old road, the fringe of dried weeds each still bearing the form its green life assumed in the vanished summer, the peeling pumpkin?colored school bus husk, a rusting harrow, a small springhouse whitewashed years ago, and then the shabby farm buildings, corn crib and barn and stone house, approached from a new angle, for the first time from the front. He drives the Celica into the space of packed dirt where he once saw the Corolla pull in; in turning off the engine and stepping from the car he sees the ridge from which he spied, a far scratchy line of black cherry and gum trees scarcely visible through the apple trees of the orchard, farther away than it had felt, the odds were no one had ever seen him. This is crazy. Run.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> But, as with dying, there is a moment that must be pushed through, a slice of time more transparent than plate glass; it is in front of him and he takes the step, drawing heart from that loving void Thelma had confided to him. In his sheepskin coat and silly small elf hat and three?piece suit of pinstriped wool bought just this November at that tailor of Webb's on Pine Street, he walks across the earth where silted?over flat sandstones once formed a walk. It is cold, a day that might bring snow, a day that feels hollow. Though it is near noon no sun shows through, not even a silver patch betrays its place in the sky, one long ribbed underbelly of low gray clouds. A drab tall thatch of winter woods rears up on his right. In the other direction, beyond the horizon, a chain saw sounds stuck. Even before, removing one glove, he raps with a bare hand on the door, where paint a poisonous green is coming loose in long curving flakes, the dog inside the house hears his footsteps scrape stone and sets up a commotion of barking.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry hopes the dog is alone, its owner out. There is no car or pick?up truck in the open, but one might be parked in the barn or the newish garage of cement blocks with a roof of corrugated overlapped Fiberglas. Inside the house no light burns that he can see, but then it is near noon, though the day is dull and growing darker. He peers in the door and sees himself reflected with his pale hat in another door, much like this one, with two tall panes of glass, the thickness of a stone wall away. Beyond the old panes a hallway with a tattered striped runner recedes into unlit depths. As his eyes strain to see deeper his nose and ungloved hand sting with the cold. He is about to turn away and return to the warm car when a shape materializes within the house and rushes, puffed up with rage, toward him. The black?haired collie leaps and leaps again against the inner door, frantic, trying to bite the glass, those ugly little front teeth a dog has, inhuman, and the split black lip and lavender gums, unclean. Harry is paralyzed with fascination; he does not see the great shape materialize behind Fritzie until a hand clatters on the inner door latch.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The fat woman's other hand holds the dog by the collar; Harry helps by opening the green outer door himself. Fritzie recognizes his scent and stops barking. And Rabbit recognizes, buried under the wrinkles and fat but with those known eyes blazing out alive, Ruth. So amid a tumult of wagging and the whimpers of that desperate doggy need to reclaim a friend, the two old lovers confront one another. Twenty years ago he had lived with this woman, March to June. He saw her for a minute in Kroll's eight years later, and she had spared him a few bitter words, and now a dozen years have poured across them both, doing their damage. Her hair that used to be a kind of dirty fiery gingery color is flattened now to an, iron gray and pulled back in a bun like the Mennonites wear. She wears wide denim dungarees and a man's red lumberjack shirt beneath a black sweater with unravelled elbows and dog hairs and wood chips caught in the greasy weave. Yet this is Ruth. Her upper lip still pushes out a little, as if with an incipient blister, and her flat blue eyes in their square sockets still gaze at him with a hostility that tickles him. "What do you want?" she asks. Her voice sounds thickened, as by a cold.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'm Harry Angstrom."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I can see that. What do you want here?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I was wondering, could we talk a little? There's something I need to ask you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No, we can't talk a little. Go away."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> But she has released the dog's collar, and Fritzie sniffs at his ankles and his crotch and writhes in her urge to jump up, to impart the scarcely bearable joy locked in her narrow skull, behind her bulging eyes. Her bad eye still looks sore. "Good Fritzie," Harry says. "Down. Down."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ruth has to laugh, that quick ringing laugh of hers, like change tossed onto a counter. "Rabbit, you're cute. Where'd you learn her name?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I heard you all calling her once. A couple times I've been here, up behind those trees, but I couldn't get up my nerve to come any closer. Stupid, huh?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She laughs again, a touch less ringingly, as if she is truly amused. Though her voice has roughened and her bulk has doubled and there is a down including a few dark hairs along her cheeks and above the comers of her mouth, this is really Ruth, a cloud his life had passed through, solid again. She is still tall, compared to Janice, compared to any of the women of his life but Mim and his mother. She always had a weight about her; she joked the first night when he lifted her that this would put him out of action, a weight that pushed him off, along with something that held him fast, an air of being willing to play, in the little space they had, and though the time they had was short. "So you were scared of us," she says. She bends slightly, to address the dog. "Fritzie, shall we let him in for a minute?" The dog's liking him, a dim spark of dog memory setting her tail wagging, has tipped the balance.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The hall inside smells decidedly of the past, the way these old farm houses do. Apples in the cellar, cinnamon in the cooking, a melding of the old plaster and wallpaper paste, he doesn't know. Muddy boots stand in a corner of the hall, on newspapers spread there, and he notices that Ruth is in stocking feet ? thick gray men's work socks, but sexy nonetheless, the silence of her steps, though she is huge. She leads him to the right, into a small front parlor with an oval rug of braided rags on the floor and a folding wooden lawn chair mixed in with the other furniture. The only modem piece is the television set, its overbearing rectangular eye dead for the moment. A small wood fire smolders in a sandstone fireplace. Harry checks his shoes before stepping onto the rag rug, to make sure he is not tracking in dirt. He removes his fancy tittle sheepskin hat.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> As if regretting this already, Ruth sits on the very edge of her chair, a cane?bottomed rocker, tipping it forward so her knees nearly touch the floor and her arm can reach down easily to scratch Fritzie's neck and keep her calm. Harry guesses he is supposed to sit opposite, on a cracked black leather settee beneath two depressing sepia studio portraits, a century old at least they must be, in matching carved frames, of a bearded type and his buttoned?up wife, both long turned to dust in their coffins. But before sitting down he sees across the room, by the light of a window whose deep sill teems with potted African violets and those broad?leafed plants people give for Mother's Days, a more contemporary set of photographs, color snapshots that line one shelf of a bookcase holding rows of the paperback mysteries and romances Ruth used to read and apparently still does. That used to hurt him about her in those months, how she would withdraw into one of those trashy thrillers set in England or Los Angeles though he was right there, in the flesh, a living lover. He crosses to the bookcase and sees her, younger but already stout, standing before a comer of this house within the arm of a man older, taller, and stouter than she: this must have been Byer. A big sheepish farmer in awkward Sunday clothes, squinting against the sunlight with an expression like that of the large old portraits, his mouth wistful in its attempt to satisfy the camera. Ruth looks amused, her hair up in a bouffant do and still gingery, amused that for this sheltering man she is a prize. Rabbit feels, for an instant as short and bright as the click of a shutter, jealous of these lives that others led: this stout plain country couple posing by a chipped corner of brown stucco, on earth that from the greening state of the grass suggests March or April. Nature's old tricks. There are other photographs, color prints of combed and smiling adolescents, in those cardboard frames high?school pictures come in. Before he can examine them, Ruth says sharply, "Who said you could look at those? Stop it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's your family."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You bet it is. Mine and not yours."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> But he cannot tear himself away from the images in flashlit color of these children. They gaze not at him but past his right ear, each posed identically by the photographer as he worked his school circuit May after May. A boy and the girl at about the same age ? the senior photo ? and then in smaller format a younger boy with darker hair, cut longer and parted on the other side of his head from his brother. All have blue eyes. "Two boys and a girl," Harry says. "Who's the oldest?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What the hell do you care? God, I'd forgotten what a pushy obnoxious bastard you are. Stuck on yourself from cradle to grave."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "My guess is, the girl is the oldest. When did you have her, and when did you marry this old guy? How can you stand it, by the way, out here in the boondocks?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I stand it fine. It's more than anybody else ever offered me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I didn't have much to offer anybody in those days."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "But you've done fine since. You're dressed up like a pansy."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And you're dressed up like a ditchdigger."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I've been cutting wood."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You operate one of those chain saws? Jesus, aren't you afraid you'll cut off a finger?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No, I'm not. The car you sold Jamie works fine, if that's what you came to ask."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How long have you known I've been at Springer Motors?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, always. And then it was in the papers when Springer died."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Was that you drove past in the old station wagon the day Nelson got married?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It might have been," Ruth says, sitting back in her rocking chair, so it tips the other way. Fritzie has stretched out to sleep. The wood fire spits. "We pass through Mt. Judge from time to time. It's a free country still, isn't it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why would you do a crazy thing like that?" She loves him.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'm not saying I did anything. How would I know Nelson was getting married at that moment?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You saw it in the papers." He sees she means to torment him. "Ruth, the girl. She's mine. She's the baby you said you couldn't stand to have the abortion for. So you had it and then found this old chump of a farmer who was glad to get a piece of young ass and had these other two kids by him before he kicked the bucket."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't talk so rude. You're not proving anything to me except what a sad case I must have been ever to take you in. You are Mr. 'Bad News, honest to God. You're nothing but me, me and gimme, gimme. When I had something to give you I gave it even though I knew I'd never get anything back. Now thank God I have nothing to give." She limply gestures to indicate the raggedly furnished little room. Her voice in these years has gained that country slowness, that stubborn calm with which the country withholds what the city wants.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Tell me the truth," he begs.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I just did."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "About the girl."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She's younger than the older boy. Scott, Annabelle, and then Morris in '66. He was the afterthought. June 6, 1966. Four sixes."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't stall, Ruth, I got to get back to Brewer. And don't lie. Your eyes get all watery when you lie."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "My eyes are watery because they can't stand looking at you. A regular Brewer sharpie. A dealer. The kind of person you used to hate, remember? And fat. At least when I knew you you had a body."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He laughs, enjoying the push of this; his night with Thelma has made his body harder to insult. "You," he says, "are calling me fat?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I am. And how did you get so red in the face?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's my tan. We just got back from the islands."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh Christ, the islands. I thought you were about to have a stroke."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "When did your old guy pack it in? Whajja do, screw him to death?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She stares at him a time. "You better go."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Soon," he promises.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Frank passed away in August of '76, of cancer. Of the colon. He hadn't even reached retirement age. When I met him he was younger than we are now."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "O.K., sorry. Listen, stop making me be such a prick. Tell me about our girl."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She's not our girl, Harry. I did have the abortion. My parents arranged it with a doctor in Pottsville. He did it right in his office and about a year later a girl died afterwards of complications and they put him in jail. Now the girls just walk into the hospital."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And expect the taxpayer to pay," Harry says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Then I got a job as the day cook in a restaurant over toward Stogey's Quarry to the east of here and Frank's cousin was the hostess for that time and one thing led to another pretty fast. We had Scott in late 1960, he just turned nineteen last month, one of these Christmas babies that always get cheated on presents."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Then the girl when? Annabelle."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "The next year. He was in a hurry for a family. His mother had never let him marry while she was alive, or anyway he blamed her."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You're lying. I've seen the girl; she's older than you say."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She's eighteen. Do you want to see birth certificates?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> This must be a bluff. But he says, "No."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Her voice softens. "Why're you so hepped on the girl anyway? Why don't you pretend the boy's yours?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I have one boy. He's enough" ? the phrase just comes ? "bad news." He asks, brusquely, "And where are they? Your boys."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What's it to you?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nothing much. I was just wondering how come they're not around, helping you with this place."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Morris is at school, he gets home on the bus after three. Scott has a job in Maryland, working in a plant nursery. I told both him and Annie, Get out. This was a good place for me to come to and hide, but there's nothing here for young people. When she and Jamie Nunemacher got this scheme of going and living together in Brewer, I couldn't say No, though his people were dead set against it. We had a big conference, I told them that's how young people do now, they live together, and aren't they smart? They know I'm an old whore anyway, I don't give a fuck what they think. The neighbors always let us alone and we let them alone. Frank and old Blankenbiller hadn't talked for fifteen years, since he began to take me out." She sees she has wandered, and says, "Annabelle won't be with the boy forever. He's nice enough, but..."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I agree," Rabbit says, as if consulted. Ruth is lonely, he sees, and willing to talk, and this makes him uneasy. He shifts his weight on the old black sofa. Its springs creak. A shift in the air outside has created a downdraft that sends smoke from the damp fire curling into the room.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She glances to the dead couple in their frames like carved coffins above his head and confides, "Even when Frank was healthy, he had to have the buses to make ends meet. Now I rent the big fields and just try to keep the bushes down. The bushes and the oil bills." And it is true, this room is so cold he has not thought of taking his heavy coat off.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yes well," he sighs. "It's hard." Fritzie, wakened by some turn in the dream that had been twitching the ends of her paws, stands and skulks over to him as if to bark, and instead drops down to the rug again, coiling herself trustfully at his feet. With his long arm Harry reaches to the bookcase and lifts out the photograph of the daughter. Ruth does not protest. He studies the pale illumined face in its frame of maroon cardboard: backed by a strange background of streaked blue like an imitation sky, the girl gazes beyond him. Round and polished like a fruit by the slick silk finish of the print, the head, instead of revealing its secret, becomes more enigmatic, a shape as strange as those forms of sea life spotlit beneath the casino boardwalk. The mouth is Ruth's, that upper lip he noticed at the lot. And around the eyes, that squared?off look, though her brow is rounder than Ruth's and her hair, brushed to a photogenic gloss, less stubborn. He looks at the ear, for a nick in the edge like Nelson has; her hair would have to be lifted. Her nose is so delicate and small, the nostrils displayed by a slight upturn of the tip, that the lower half of her face seems heavy, still babyish. There is a candor to her skin and a frosty light to the eyes that could go back to those Swedes in their world of snow; he glimpsed it in the Murketts' bathroom mirror. His blood. Harry finds himself reliving with Annabelle that moment when her turn came in the unruly school line to enter the curtained corner of the gym and, suddenly blinded, to pose for posterity, for the yearbook, for boyfriend and mother, for time itself as it wheels on unheeding by: the opportunity come to press your face up against blankness and, by thinking right thoughts, to become a star. "She looks like me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ruth laughs now. "You're seeing things."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No kidding. When she came to the lot that first time, something hit me ?her legs, maybe, I don't know. Those aren't your legs." Which had been thick, twisting like white flame as she moved naked about their room.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well, Frank had legs too. Until he let himself get out of shape, he was on the lanky side. Over six foot, when he straightened up, I'm a ?sucker for the big ones I guess. Then neither of the boys inherited his height."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah, Nelson didn't get mine, either. A shrimp just like his mother."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You're still with Janice. You used to call her a mutt," Ruth reminds him. She has settled into this situation comfortably now, leaning back in the rocker and rocking, her stocking feet going up on tiptoe, then down on the heels, then back on tiptoe. "Why am I telling you all about my life when you don't say a thing about yours?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's pretty standard," he says. "Don't be sore at me because I stayed with Janice. "
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh Christ no. I just feel sorry for her."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "A sister," he says, smiling. Women are all sisters, they tell us now.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Fat has been added to Ruth's face not in smooth scoops but in lumps, so when she lifts her head her eye sockets seem built of bony welts. A certain forgiving mischief has lifted her armored glance. "Annie was fascinated by you," she volunteers. "She several times asked me if I'd ever heard of you, this basketball hero. I said we went to different high schools. She was disappointed when you weren't there when she and Jamie went back to pick up the car finally. Jamie had been leaning to a Fiesta."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "So you don't think Jamie is the answer for her?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "For now. But you've seen him. He's common."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I hope she doesn't -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Go my way? No, it'll be all right. There aren't whores anymore, just healthy young women. I've raised her very innocent. I always felt 1 was very innocent, actually."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "We all are, Ruth."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She likes his saying her name, he should be careful about saying it. He puts the photograph back and studies it in place, Annabelle between her brothers. "How about money?" he asks, trying to keep it light. "Would some help her? I could give it to you so it, you know, wouldn't come out of the blue or anything. If she wants an education, for instance." He is blushing, and Ruth's silence doesn't help. The rocker has stopped rocking.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> At last she says, "I guess this is what they call deferred payments."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's not for you, it would be for her. I can't give a lot. I mean, I'm not that rich. But if a couple thousand would make a difference -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He lets the sentence hang, expecting to be interrupted. He can't look at her, that strange expanded face. Her voice when it comes has the contemptuous confident huskiness he heard from her ages ago, in bed. "Relax. You don't have to worry, I'm not going to take you up on it. If I ever get really hard up here I can sell off apiece of road frontage, five thousand an acre is what they've been getting locally. Anyway, Rabbit. Believe me. She's not yours."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "O.K., Ruth. If you say so." In his surge of relief he stands.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She stands too, and having risen together their ghosts feel their inflated flesh fall away; the young man and woman who lived illicitly together one flight up on Summer Street, across from a big limestone church, stand close again, sequestered from the world, and as before the room is hers. "Listen," she hisses up at him, radiantly is his impression, her distorted face gleaming. "I wouldn't give you the satisfaction of that girl being yours if there was a million dollars at stake. I raised her. She and I put in a lot of time together here and where the fuck were you? You saw me in Kroll's that time and there was no follow?up, I've known where you were all these years and you didn't give a simple shit what had happened to me, or my kid, or anything."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You were married," he says mildly. My kid: something odd here.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You bet I was," she rushes on. "To a better man than you'll ever be, sneer all you want. The kids have had a wonderful father and they know it. When he died we just carried on as if he was still around, he was that strong. Now I don't know what the hell is going on with you in your little life up there in Mt. Judge -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "We're moving," he tells her. "To Penn Park."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Swell. That's just where you belong, with those phonies. You should have left that mutt of yours twenty years ago for her good as well as your own, but you didn't and now you can stew in it; stew in it but leave my Annie alone. It's creepy, Harry. When I think of you thinking she's your daughter it's like rubbing her all over with shit."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He sighs through his nose. "You still have a sweet tongue," he says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She is embarrassed; her iron hair has gone straggly and she presses it flat with the heels of her hands as if trying to crush something inside her skull. "I shouldn't say something like that but it's frightening, having you show up in your fancy clothes wanting to claim my daughter. You make me think, if I hadn't had the abortion, if I hadn't let my parents have their way, it might have all worked out differently, and we could have a daughter now. But you
<br> 
<br> "I know. You did the right thing." He feels her fighting the impulse to touch him, to cling to him, to let herself be crushed into his clumsy arms as once. He looks for a last topic. Awkwardly he asks, "What're you going to do, when Morris grows up and leaves home?" He remembers his hat and picks it up, pinching the soft new crown in three fingers.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't know. Hang on a little more. Whatever happens, land won't go down. Every year I last it out here is money in the bank."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He sighs through his nose again. "O.K., if that's how it is. I'll run then. Really no soap on the girl?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Of course not. Think it through. Suppose she was yours. At this stage it'd just confuse her."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He blinks. Is this an admission? He says, "I never was too good at thinking things through."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ruth smiles at the floor. The squarish dent above her cheekbone, seen this way from above, was one of the first things he noticed about her. Chunky and tough but kindly, somehow. Another human heart, telling him he was a big bunny, out by the parking meters in the neon light, the first time they met. Trains still ran through the center of Brewer then. "Men don't have to be," she says. "They don't get pregnant."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The dog became agitated when they both stood and Ruth's voice became louder and angry, and now Fritzie leads them from the room and waits, tail inquisitively wagging, with her nose at the crack of the door leading outside. Ruth opens it and the storm door wide enough for the dog to pass through but not Harry. "Want a cup of coffee?" she asks.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He told Janice one o'clock at Schaechner's. "Oh Jesus, thanks, but I ought to get back to work."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You came here just about Annabelle? You don't want to hear about me?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I have heard about you, haven't I?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Whether I have a boyfriend or not, whether I ever thought about you?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah, well, I'm sure that'd be interesting. From the sound of it you've done terrifically. Frank and Morris and, who's the other one?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Scott."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Right. And you have all this land. Sorry, you know, to have left you in such a mess way back then."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well," Ruth says, with a considering slowness in which he imagines he can hear her late husband speaking. "I guess we make our own messes."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She seems now not merely fat and gray but baffled: straw on her sweater, hair on her cheeks. A shaggy monster, lonely. He longs to be out that double door into the winter air, where nothing is growing. Once he escaped by telling her, I'll be right back, but now there is not even that to say. Both know, what people should never know, that they will not meet again. He notices on the hand of hers that grips the doorknob a thin gold ring all but lost in the flesh of one finger. His heart races, trapped.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She has mercy on him. "Take care, Rabbit," she says. "I was just kidding about the outfit, you look good." Harry ducks his head as if to kiss her cheek but she says, "No." By the time he has taken a step off the concrete porch, her shadow has vanished from the double door's black glass. The gray of the day has intensified, releasing a few dry flakes of snow that will not amount to anything, that float sideways like flecks of ash. Fritzie trots beside him to the glossy grape?blue Cebca, and has to be discouraged from jumping into the back seat.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Once on his way, out the driveway and past the mailboxes that say BLANKENBILLER and MUTH, Harry pops a Life Saver into his mouth and wonders if he should have called her bluff on the birth certificates. Or suppose Frank had had another wife, and Scott was his child by that marriage? If the girl was as young as Ruth said, wouldn't she still be in high school? But no. Let go. Let it go. God doesn't want him to have a daughter.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Waiting in the overheated front room of Schaechner's surrounded by plush new furniture, Janice looks petite and prosperous and, with her Caribbean tan, younger than forty?three. When he kisses her, on the lips, she says, "Mmm. Butter Rum. What are you hiding?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Onions for lunch."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She dips her nose close to his lapel. "You smell of smoke."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Uh, Manny gave me a cigar."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She hardly listens to his lies, she is breathy and electric with news of her own. "Harry, Melanie called Mother from Ohio. Nelson is with her. Everything's all right."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> As Janice continues, he can see her mouth move, her bangs tremble, her eyes widen and narrow, and her fingers tug in excitement at the pearl strand the lapels of her coat disclose, but Rabbit is distracted from the exact sense of what she is saying by remembering, when he bent his face close to old Ruth's in the light of the door, a glitter there, on the tired skin beneath her eyes, and by the idiotic thought, which it seems he should bottle and sell, that our tears are always young, the saltwater stays the same from cradle, as she said, to grave.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The little stone house that Harry and Janice bought for $78,000, with $15,600 down, sits on a quarter?acre of bushy land tucked in off a macadamized dead end behind two larger examples of what is locally known as Penn Park Pretentious: a tall mockTudor with gables like spires and red?tiled roofs and clinker bricks sticking out at crazy melted angles, and a sort of neo?plantation manse of serene thin bricks the pale yellow of lemonade, with a glassed?in sunporch and on the other side a row of Palladian windows, where Harry guesses the dining room is. He has been out surveying his property, looking for a sunny patch where a garden might be dug in this spring. The spot behind Ma Springer's house on Joseph Street had been too shady. He finds a corner that might ?do, with some cutting back of oak limbs that belong to his neighbor. The earth generally in this overgrown, mature suburb is wellshaded; his lawn is half moss, which this mild winter has dried but left exposed and resilient still. He also finds a little cement fish pond with a blue?painted bottom, dry and drifted with pine needles. Someone had once sunk seashells in the wet cement of the slanting rim. The things you buy when you buy a house. Doorknobs, windowsills, radiators. All his. If he were a fish he could swim in this pond, come spring. He tries to picture that moment when whoever it was, man, woman, or child or all three, had set these shells here, in the summer shade of trees a little less tall than these above him now. The weak winter light falls everywhere in his yard, webbed by the shadows from leafless twigs. He senses standing here a silt of caring that has fallen from purchaser to purchaser. The house was built in that depressed but scrupulous decade when Harry was born. Suave gray limestone had been hauled from the quarries in the far north of Diamond County and dressed and fitted by men who took the time to do it right. At a later date, after the war, some owner broke through the wall facing away from the curb and built an addition of clapboards and white?blotched brick. Paint is peeling from the clapboards beneath the Andersen windows of what is now Janice's kitchen. Harry makes a mental note to trim back the branches that brush against the house, to cut down the dampness. Indeed there are several trees here that might be turned altogether into firewood, but until they leaf out in the spring he can't be sure which should go. The house has two fireplaces, one in the big long living room and the other, off the same flue, in the little room behind, that Harry thinks of as a den. His den.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He and Janice moved in yesterday, a Saturday. Pru was coming home from the hospital with the baby and if they were not there she could take their Joseph Street bedroom, with its own bathroom, away from the street. Also they thought the confusion might mask for Janice's mother the pain of their escape. Webb Murkett and the others got back from the Caribbean Thursday night as planned, and Saturday morning Webb brought one of his roofer's trucks with extension ladders roped to both sides and helped them move. Ronnie Harrison, that fink, said he had to go into the office to tackle the backlog of paperwork that had built up during his vacation; he had worked Friday night to midnight. But Buddy Inglefinger came over with Webb, and it didn't take the three men more than two hours to move the Angstroms. There wasn't much furniture they could call their own, mostly clothes, and Janice's mahogany bureau, and some cardboard boxes of kitchen equipment that had been salvaged when the previous house they could call their own had burned down in 1969. All of Nelson's stuff, they left. One of the butch women came out onto her porch and waved goodbye; so news travels in a neighborhood, even when the people aren't friendly. Harry had always meant to ask them what it was like, and why. He can see not liking men, he doesn't like them much himself, but why would you like women any better, ifyou were one? Especially women who hammer all the time, just like men.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> From Schaechner's on Thursday afternoon he and Janice had bought, and got them to deliver on Friday, a new color Sony TV (Rabbit hates to put any more money into Japanese pockets but he knows from Consumer Reports that in this particular line they can't be touched for quality) and a pair of big padded silvery?pink wing chairs (he has always wanted a wing chair, he hates drafts on his neck, people have died from drafts on their necks) and a Queen?size mattress and box springs on a metal frame, without headboard. This bed he and Webb and Buddy carry upstairs to the room at the back, with a partially slanted ceiling but space for a mirror if they want it on the blank wall next to the closet door, and the chairs and TV go not into the living room, which is too big to think about furnishing at first, but into the much cozier room just off it, the den. Always he has wanted a den, a room where people would have trouble getting at him. What he especially loves about this little room, besides the fireplace and the built?in shelves where you could keep either books or Ma's knickknacks and china when she dies, with liquor in the cabinets below, and even room for a little refrigerator when they get around to it, are the wall?to?wall carpeting of a kind of greenand?orange mix that reminds him of cheerleaders' tassels and the little high windows whose sashes crank open and shut and are composed of leaded lozenge?panes such as you see in books of fairy tales. He thinks in this room he might begin to read books, instead of just magazines and newspapers, and begin to learn about history, say. You have to step down into the den, one step down from the hardwood floor of the living room, and this small difference in plane hints to him of many reforms and consolidations now possible in his life, like new shoots on a tree cropped back.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Franklin Drive is the elegant street their dead?end spur cuts off of 14VZ Franklin Drive is their postal address, and the spur itself has no street name, they should call it Angstrom Way. Webb suggested Angstrom Alley, but Harry has had enough of alleys in his Mt. Judge years, and resents Webb's saying this. First he tells you to sell gold too soon, then he fucks your wife, and now he puts your house down. Harry has never lived at so low a number as 14Y2 before. But the mailman in his little red, white, and blue jeep knows where they are. Already they've received mail here: flyers to RESIDENT collected while they were in the Caribbean, and Saturday around one?thirty, after Webb and Buddy were gone, while Janice and Harry in the kitchen were arranging spoons and pans they'd forgotten they owned, the letter slot clacked and a postcard and a white envelope lay on the front hall's bare floor. The envelope, one of the long plain stamped ones you buy at the post office, had no return address and was postmarked Brewer. It was addressed to just MR. HARRY ANGSTROM in the same slanting block printing that had sent him last April the clipping about Skeeter. Inside this new envelope the clipping was very small, and the same precise hand that had addressed it had schoolteacherishly inscribed in ballpoint along the top edge, From "Golf Magazine" Annual "Roundup." The item read:
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> A COSTLY BIRDIE
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Dr. Sherman Thomas cooked his own goose when he killed one of the Canadian variety at Congressional CC. The court levied a $500 fine for the act.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice forced a laugh, reading at his side, there in the echoing bare hallway, that led through a white arch into the long living room.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He looked over at her guiltily and agreed with her unspoken thought. "Thelma."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Her color had risen. A minute before, they had been in sentimental raptures over an old Mixmaster that, plugged in again after ten years in Ma Springer's attic, had whirred. Now she blurted, "She'll never let us alone. Never."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Thelma? Of course she will, that was the deal. She was very definite about it. Weren't you, with Webb?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh of course, but words don't mean anything to a woman in love."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Who? You with Webb?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No, you goon. Thelma. With you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She told me, she loves Ronnie. Though I don't see how she can."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He's her bread and butter. You're her dream man. You really turn her on."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You sound amazed," he said accusingly.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, you don't not turn me on, I can see what she sees, it's just. . ." She turned away to hide her tears. Everywhere he looked, women were crying. ". . . . the intrusion. To know that that was her that sent that other thing way back then, to think of her watching us all the time, waiting to pounce . . . They're evil people, Harry. I don't want to see any of them anymore."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh come on." He had to hug her, there in the hollow hall. He likes it now when she gets all flustered and frowny, her breath hot and somehow narrow with grief she seems most his then, the keystone of his wealth. Once when she got like this, her fear contaminated him and he ran; but in these middle years it is so clear to him that he will never run that he can laugh at her, his stubborn prize. "They're just like us. That was a holiday. In real life they're very square."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice was vehement. "I'm furious with her, doing such a flirtatious thing, so soon after. They'll never let us alone, never, now that we have a house. As long as we were at Mother's we were protected."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> And it was true, the Harrisons and the Murketts and Buddy Inglefinger and the tall new girlfriend with her frizzy hair now up in corn rows and juju beads like the woman in "10" did come over last night, the Angstroms' first night in their new house, bearing bottles of champagne and brandy, and stayed until two, so Sunday feels sour and guilty. Harry has no habits yet in this house; without habits and Ma Springer's old furniture to cushion him, his life stretches emptily on all sides, and it seems that moving in any direction he's bound to take a fall.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The other piece of mail that came Saturday, the postcard, was from Nelson.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Hi Mom &amp; Dad ?
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Spring Semester begins the 28th so am in good shape. Need certified check for $1087 (397 instrucional fee, 90 general fee, 600 surcharge for non Ohio students) plus living expenses. $2000?2500 slid. be enuff. Will call when you have phone. Melanie says Hi. Love, Nelson
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> On the other side of the card was a modern brick building topped by big slatted things like hot air vents, identified as Business
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Administration Building, Kent State University. Harry asked, "What about Pru? The kid's a father and doesn't seem to know it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He knows it. He just can't do everything at once. He's told
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Pru over the phone he'll drive back as soon as he's registered and look at the baby and leave us the car he took. Though maybe,
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry, we could just let him use it for now."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's my Corona!"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He's doing what you wanted him to do, go back to college.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Pru understands."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She understands she's linked up with a hopeless loser," Harry said, but his heart wasn't in it. The kid was no threat to him for now. Harry was king of the castle.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> And today is Super Sunday. Janice tries to get him up for church, she is driving Mother, but he is far too hungover and wants to return to the warm pocket of a dream he had been having, a dream involving a girl, a young woman, he has never met before, with darkish hair, they have met somehow at a party and are in a little bathroom together, not speaking but with a rapport, as if just having had sex or about to have sex, between them, sex very certain and casual between them but not exactly happening, the floor of many small square tiles at an angle beneath them, the small space of the bathroom cupped around them like the little chrome bowl around the flame of the perpetual cigar lighter at the old tobacco store downtown, the bliss of a new relationship, he wants it to go on and on but is awake and can't get back. This bed- room, its bright slanted ceiling, is strange. They must get curtains soon. Is Janice up to this? Poor mutt, she's never had to do much. He makes what breakfast he can of a single orange in the nearly empty refrigerator, plus some salted nuts left over from the party last night, plus a cup of instant coffee dissolved with hot water straight from the tap. This house too, like Webb's, has those single?lever faucets shaped like a slender prick stung on the tip by a bee. The refrigerator went with the place and, one of the things that sold him, has an automatic ice?maker that turns out crescent- shaped cubes by the bushel. Even though the old Mixmaster works he hasn't forgotten his promise to Janice to buy her a Cuisinart. Maybe the trouble she has getting meals on the table related to its being Ma Springer's old?fashioned kitchen. He roams through his house warily exulting in the cast?iron radiators, the brass window catches, the classy little octagonal bathroom tiles, and the doors with key?lock knobs; these details of what he has bought shine out in the absence of furniture and will soon sink from view as the days here clutter them over. Now they are naked and pristine.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Upstairs, in a slanting closet off of what once must have been a boys' bedroom ? its walls pricked with dozens of thumbtack holes and marred with ends of Scotch tape used to hold posters - he finds stacks of Playboys and Penthouses from the early Seventies. He fetches from out beside the kitchen steps, under the slowly revolving electric meter, one of the big green plastic trash barrels he and Janice bought yesterday at Shur Valu; but before disposing of each magazine Rabbit leafs through it, searching out the center spreads month after month, year after year, as the airbrushing recedes and the pubic hair first peeks and then froths boldly forth and these young women perfect as automobile bodies let their negligees fall open frontally and revolve upon their couches of leopard skin so subscribers' eyes at last can feast upon their full shame and treasure. An invisible force month after month through each year's seasons forces gently wider open their flawless thighs until somewhere around the bicentennial issues the Constitutional triumph of open beaver is attained, and the buxom boldly gazing girls from Texas and Hawaii and South Dakota yield up to the lights and lens a vertical rosy aperture that seems to stare back, out of a blood?flushed nether world, scarcely pretty, an ultimate of disclosure which yet acts as a barrier to some secret beyond, within, still undisclosed as the winter light diminishes at the silent window. Outside, a squirrel is watching, its gray back arched, its black eye alert. Nature, Harry sees, is everywhere. This tree that comes so close to the house he thinks is a cherry, its bark in rings. The squirrel, itself spied, scurries on. The full load of magazines makes the trash barrel almost too heavy to lift. A ton of cunt. He lugs it downstairs. Janice comes back after two, having had lunch with her mother and Pru and the baby.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Everybody seemed cheerful," she reports, "including Baby."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Baby have a name yet?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Pru asked Nelson about Rebecca and he said absolutely not. Now she's thinking of Judith. That's her mother's name. I told them to forget Janice, I never much liked it for myself."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I thought she hated her mother."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She doesn't hate her, she doesn't much respect her. It's her father she hates. But he's been on the phone to her a couple of times and been very, what's the word, conciliatory."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh great. Maybe he can come and help run the lot. He can do our steam fitting. How does Pru feel about Nelson's running off, just on the eve?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice takes off her hat, a fuzzy violet loose?knit beret she wears in winter and that makes her look with the sheepskin coat like some brown?faced boy of a little soldier off to the wars. Her hair stands up with static electricity. In the empty living room she has nowhere to drop her hat, and throws it onto a white windowsill. "Well," she says, "she's interesting about it. For just now she says she's just as glad he isn't around, it would be one more thing to cope with. In general she feels it's something he had to do, to get his shit together ?that's her expression. I think she knows she pushed him. Once he gets his degree, she thinks, he'll be much more comfortable with himself. She doesn't seem at all worried about losing him for good or anything."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Huh. Whaddeya have to do to get blamed for something these days?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "They're very tolerant of each other," Janice says, "and I think that's nice." She heads upstairs, and Harry follows her up, closely, afraid of losing her in the vast newness of their house.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He asks, "She gonna go out there and live with him in an apartment or what?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She thinks her going out there with the baby would panic him right now. And of course for Mother it'd be much nicer if she stayed."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Isn't Pru at all miffed about Melanie?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No, she says Melanie will watch after him for her. They don't have this jealousy thing the way we do, if you can believe them."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "If."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Speaking of which." Janice drops her coat on the bed and bends over, ass high, to unzip her boots. "Thelma had left a message with Mother about whether or not you and I wanted to come over to their house for a light supper and watch the Super Bowl. I guess the Murketts will be there."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And you said?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I said No. Don't worry, I was quite sweet. I said we were having Mother and Pru over here to watch the game on our brand?new Sony. It's true. I invited them." In stocking feet she stands and puts her hands on the hips of her black church suit as if daring him to admit he would rather go out and be with that racy crowd than stay home with his family.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Fine," he says. "I haven't really seen -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, and quite a sad thing. Mother got it from Grace Stuhl, who's good friends apparently with Peggy Fosnacht's aunt. While we were down there Peggy went into her doctor's for a check?up and by nighttime he had her in the hospital and a breast taken off."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "My God." Breast he had sucked. Poor old Peggy. Flicked away by God's fmgemail. Life is too big for us, in the end.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "They of course said they got it all but then they always say that.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She seemed lately headed for something unfortunate."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She's been grotesque. I should call her, but not today."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice is changing into dungarees to do housecleaning. She says the people have left the place filthy but he can't see it, except for the Playboys. She has never been much of a neatness freak wherever they have lived before. Uncurtained winter light bouncing off the bare floors and blank walls turns her underwear to silver and gives her shoulders and arms a quick life as of darting fish before they disappear into an old shirt of his and a moth?eaten sweater. Behind her their new bed, unmade, hasn't been fucked on yet, they were too drunk and exhausted last night. In fact they haven't since that night on the island. He asks her irritably what about his lunch.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice asks, "Oh, didn't you find something in the fridge?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "There was one orange. I ate it for breakfast."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I know I bought eggs and sliced ham but I guess Buddy and what's?her?name ?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Valerie."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Wasn't her hair wild? do you think she takes drugs? ? ate it all up in that omelette they made after midnight. Isn't that a sign of drugs, an abnormal appetite for food? I know there's some cheese left, Harry. Couldn't you make do with cheese and crackers until I go out and buy something for Mother later? I don't know what's open Sundays around here, I can't keep running back to the Mt. Judge Superette and using up gas."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "'No," he agrees, and makes do with cheese and crackers and a Schlitz that is left over from the three sixpacks Ronnie and Thelma brought over. Webb and Cindy brought the brandy and champagne. All afternoon he helps Janice clean, Windexing windows and wiping woodwork while she mops floors and even scours the kitchen and bathroom sinks. They have a downstairs bathroom here but he doesn't know where to buy toilet paper printed with comic strips. Janice has brought her mother's waxing machine in the Mustang along with some Butcher's paste and he wipes the wax on the long blond living?room floor, each whorl of wood grain and slightly popped?up nail and old scuff of a rubber heel his, his house. As he lays the wax on with circular swipes Rabbit keeps chasing the same few thoughts in his brain, stupid as brains are when you do physical work. Last night he kept wondering if the other two couples had gone ahead and swapped, Ronnie and Cindy doing it the second time, after he and Janice had left and they did act cozy, as if the four of them made the innermost circle of the party and the Angstroms and poor Buddy and that hungry Valerie were second echelon or third worlders somehow. Thelma got pretty drunk for her, her sallow skin gleaming to remind him of Vaseline, though when he thanked her for sending the clipping about the goose she stared at him and then sideways at Ronnie and then back at him as if he had rocks in his head. He guesses it'll all come out, what happened down there afterwards, people can't keep a good secret, but it pains him to think that Thelma would let Webb do to her everything the two of them did or that Cindy really wanted to go with Ronnie again and would lift up her heavy breast with a motherly hand so that loudmouthed jerk could suck and tell about it, with his scalp bare like that he's such a baby, Harrison. No point in keeping secrets, we'll all be dead soon enough, already we're survivors, the kids are everywhere, making the music, giving the news. Ever since that encounter with Ruth he's felt amputated, a whole world half?seen in the comer of his eye snuffed out. Janice and the waxing machine are whining and knocking behind him and the way his brain is going on reminds him of some article he read last year in the paper or Time about some professor at Princeton's theory that in ancient times the gods spoke to people directly through the left or was it the right half of their brains, they were like robots with radios in their heads telling them everything to do, and then somehow around the time of the ancient Greeks or Assyrians the system broke up, the batteries too weak to hear the orders, though there are glimmers still and that is why we go to church, and what with all these jigaboos and fags roller?skating around with transistorized earmuffs on their heads we're getting back to it. How at night just before drifting off he hears Mom's voice clear as a whisper from the corner of the room saying Hassy, a name as dead as the boy that was called that is dead. Maybe the dead are gods, there's certainly something kind about them, the way they give you room. What you lose as you age is witnesses, the ones that watched from early on and cared, like your own little grandstand. Mom, Pop, old man Springer, baby Becky, good old Jill (maybe ?that dream had to do with the time he took her in so suddenly, except her hair wasn't dark, it was so intense, the dream, there's nothing like a new relationship), Skeeter, Mr. Abendroth, Frank Byer, Mamie Eisenhower just recently, John Wayne, LBJ, JFK, Skylab, the goose. With Charlie's mother and Peggy Fosnacht cooking. And his daughter Annabelle Byer snuffed out with that whole world he was watching in the corner of his eye like those entire planets obliterated in Star Wars. The more dead you know it seems the more living there are you don't know. Ruth's tears, when he was leaving: maybe God is in the universe the way salt is in the ocean, giving it a taste. He could never understand why people can't drink saltwater, it can't be any worse than mixing Coke and potato chips.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Behind him he hears Janice knocking her waxer clumsily against the baseboards at every sweep and it comes to him why they're being so busy, they're trying not to panic here in this house, where they shouldn't be at all, so far from Joseph Street. Lost in space. Like what souls must feel when they awaken in a baby's body so far from Heaven: not only scared so they cry but guilty, guilty. A huge hole to fill up. The money it'll take to fill these rooms with furniture when they had it all free before: he's ruined himself. And the mortgage payments: $62,400 at 13%2 per cent comes to nearly $8500 interest alone, $700 a month over twenty years nibbling away at the principal until he's sixty?six. What did Ruth say about her youngest, 6/6/66? Funny about numbers, they don't lie but do play tricks. Three score and ten, all the things he'll never get to do now: to have Cindy arrange herself in the pose of one of those Penthouse sluts on a leopard skin and get down in front of her on all fours and just eat and eat and eat.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Last night Buddy turned to him so drunk his silver?rimmed eyeglasses were steamed and said he knew it was crazy, he knew what people would say about her being too tall and having three children and all, but Valerie really did it for him. She is the one, Harry. With tears in his eyes he said that. The big news from over at the Flying Eagle was Doris Kaufmann's planning to get married again. To a guy Rabbit used to know slightly, Don Eberhardt, who had gotten rich buying up inner?city real estate when nobody wanted it, before the gas crunch. Life is sweet, that's what they say.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Light still lingers in the windows, along the white windowsills, at five when they finish, the days this time of year lengthening against the grain. The planets keep their courses no matter what we do. In the freshly waxed hall by the foot of the stairs he touches Janice underneath her chin where the flesh is soft but not really repulsive and suggests a little nap upstairs, but she gives him a kiss warm and competent, the competence cancelling out the warmth, and tells him, "Oh Harry, that's a sweet idea but I have no idea when they might be coming, it's all mixed up with a hedown Mother was going to have, she really does seem frailer, and the baby's feeding time, and I haven't even shopped yet. Isn't the Super Bowl on?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not till six, it's on the West Coast. There's a pre?game thing on at four?thirty but it's all hoopla, you can only take so much. I wanted to watch the Phoenix Open at two?thirty, but you were so damn frantic to clean up just because your mother's coming over."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You should have said something. I could have done it myself."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> While she goes off in the Mustang he goes upstairs, because there isn't any place downstairs to lie down. He hopes to see the squirrel again, but the animal is gone. He thought squirrels hibernated, but maybe this winter is too mild. He holds his hands over a radiator, his, and with pride and satisfaction feels it breathing heat. He lies down on their new bed with the Amish quilt they brought from Mt. Judge and almost without transition falls asleep. In his dream he and Charlie are in trouble at the agency, some crucial papers with numbers on them are lost, and where the new cars should be in the showroom there are just ragged craters, carefully painted with stripes and stars, in the concrete floor. He awakes realizing he is running scared. There has been another explosion, muffled: Janice closing the door downstairs. It is after six. "I had to drive out almost to the ballpark before I found this MinitMart that was open. They didn't have fresh anything of course, but I got four frozen Chinese dinners that the pictures of on the box looked good."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Isn't crap like that loaded with chemicals? You don't want to poison Pru's milk."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And I bought you lots of baloney and eggs and cheese and crackers so stop your complaining."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The nap, that at first waking had felt as if somebody had slugged him in the face with a ball of wet clothes, begins to sink into his bones and cheer him up. Darkness has erased the staring depth of day; the windows might be black photographic plates in their frames. Thelma and Nelson are out there circling, waiting to move in. Janice bought thirty dollars' worth at the MinitMart and as she fills the bright refrigerator he sees in a comer there are two more beers that escaped the vultures last night. She even brought him a jar of salted peanuts for all of $1.29 to watch the game with. The first half sways back and forth. He is rooting for the Steelers to lose, he hates what they did to the Eagles and in any case doesn't like overdogs; he pulls for the Rams the way he does for the Afghan rebels against the Soviet military machine.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> At half?time a lot of girls in colored dresses and guys that look like fags in striped jerseys dance while about a thousand pieces of California brass imitate the old Big Bands with an off?key blare; these kids try to jitterbug but they don't have the swing, that onebeat wait back on your heels and then the twirl. They do a lot of disco wiggling instead. Then some little piece of sunshine with an Andrews?sisters pageboy sings "Sentimental journey" but it doesn't have that Doris Day wartime Forties soul, how could it? No war. These kids were all born, can you believe it, around 1960 at the earliest and, worse yet, are sexually mature. On the "a?all aboard" they snake together in what is supposed to be the Chattanooga Choo?choo and then produce, out there in cloudless California, flashing sheets like tinfoil that are supposed to be solar panels. "Energy is people," they sing. "People are en?er?gy!" Who needs Khomeini and his oil? Who needs Afghanistan? Fuck the Russkis. Fuck the Japs, for that matter. We'll go it alone, from sea to shining sea.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Tired of sitting in his den alone with a hundred million other boobs watching, Harry goes into the kitchen for that second beer, Janice sits at a card table her mother parted with as a loan grudgingly, even though she never plays cards except in the Poconos. "Where are our guests?" he asks.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice is sitting there helping the Chinese dinners warm up in the oven and reading a copy of House Beautiful she must have bought at the MinitMart. "They must have fallen asleep. They're up a good deal of the night, in a way it's a merry, Harry, we're not there anymore."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He trims his lips in upon a bitter taste in the beer. Grain gone bad. Men love their poison. "Well I guess living in this house with just you is the way for me to lose weight. I never get fed."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You'll get fed," she says, turning a slick page.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Jealous of the magazine, of the love for this house he feels growing in her, he complains, "It's like waiting for a shoe to drop."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She darts a dark, not quite hostile look up at him. "I'd think you've had enough shoes drop lately to last ten years."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> From her tone he supposes she means something about Thelma but that had been far from his mind, for now.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Their guests don't arrive until early in the fourth quarter, just after Bradshaw, getting desperate, has thrown a bomb to Stallworth; receiver and defender go up together and the lucky stiff makes a circus catch. Rabbit still feels the Rams are going to win it. Janice calls that Ma and Pru are here. Ma Springer is all chattery in the front hall, taking off her mink, about the drive through Brewer, where hardly any cars were moving because she supposes of the game. She is teaching Pru to drive the Chrysler and Pru did very well once they figured out how to move the seat back: she hadn't realized what long legs Pru has. Pru, pressing a pink?wrapped bundle tight to her chest out of the cold, looks worn and thin in the face but more aligned, like a bed tugged smooth. "We would have been here earlier but I was typing a letter to Nelson and wanted to finish," she apologizes.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It worries me," Ma is going on, "they used to say it brought bad luck to take a baby out visiting before it was baptized."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh Mother," Janice says; she is eager to show her mother the cleaned?up house and leads her upstairs, even though the only lights are some 40?watt neo?colonial wall sconces in which the previous owners had let many of the bulbs die.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> As Harry resettles himself in one of his silvery?pink wing chairs ?in front of the game, he can hear the old lady clumping on her painful legs directly above his head, inspecting, searching out the room where she might some day have to come and stay. He assumes Pru is with them, but the footsteps mingling on the ceiling are not that many, and Teresa comes softly down the one step into his den and deposits into his lap what he has been waiting for. Oblong cocooned little visitor, the baby shows her profile blindly in the shuddering flashes of color jerking from the Sony, the tiny stitchless seam of the closed eyelid aslant, lips bubbled forward beneath the whorled nose as if in delicate disdain, she knows she's good. You can feel in the curve of the cranium she's feminine, that shows from the first day. Through all this she has pushed to be here, in his lap, his hands, a real presence hardly weighing anything but alive. Fortune's hostage, heart's desire, a granddaughter. His. Another nail in his coffin. His.
