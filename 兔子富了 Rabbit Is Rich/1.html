The fucking world is running out of gas. But they won't catch him, not yet, because there isn't a piece of junk on the road gets better mileage than his Toyotas, with lower service costs. Read Consumer Reports, April issue. That's all he has to tell the people when they come in. And come in they do, the people out there are getting frantic, they know the great American ride is ending. Gas lines at ninety?nine point nine cents a gallon and ninety per cent of the stations to be closed for the weekend. The governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania calling for five?dollar minimum sales to stop the pan-icky topping?up. And truckers who can't get diesel shooting at their own trucks, there was an incident right in Diamond County, along the Pottsville Pike. People are going wild, their dollars are going rotten, they shell out like there's no tomorrow. He tells them, when they buy a Toyota, they're turning their dollars into yen. And they believe him. A hundred twelve units new and used moved in the first five months of 1979, with eight Corollas, five Coronas including a Luxury Edition Wagon, and that Celica that Charlie said looked like a Pimpmobile unloaded in these first three weeks of June already, at an average gross mark?up of eight hun-dred dollars per sale. Rabbit is rich.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He owns Springer Motors, one of the two Toyota agencies in the Brewer area. Or rather he co?owns a half?interest with his wife Janice, her mother Bessie sitting on the other half inherited when old man Springer died five years back. But Rabbit feels as though he owns it all, showing up at the showroom day after day, riding herd on the paperwork and the payroll, swinging in his clean suit in and out of Service and Parts where the men work filmed with oil and look up white?eyed from the bulb?lit engines as in a kind of underworld while he makes contact with the public, the community, the star and spearpoint of all these two dozen employees and hundred thousand square feet of working space, which seem a wide shadow behind him as he stands there up front. The wall of imitation boards, really sheets of random?grooved Masonite, around the door into his office is hung with framed old clippings and team portraits, including two all?county tens, from his days as a basketball hero twenty years ago ? no, more than twenty?five years now. Even under glass, the clippings keep yellowing, something in the chemistry of the paper apart from the air, something like the deepening taint of sin people used to try to scare you with. ANGSTROM HITS FOR 42. "Rabbit" Leads Mt. Judge Into Semi?Finals. Resurrected from the attic where his dead parents had long kept them, in scrapbooks whose mucilage had dried so they came loose like snakeskins, these clippings thus displayed were Fred Springer's idea, along with that phrase about an agency's reputation being the shadow of the man up front. Knowing he was dying long before he did, Fred was getting Harry ready to be the man up front. When you think of the dead, you got to be grateful.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ten years ago when Rabbit got laid off as a Linotyper and reconciled with Janice, her father took him on as salesman and when the time was ripe five years later had the kindness to die. Who would have thought such a little tense busy bird of a man could get it up for a massive coronary? Hypertense: his diastolic had been up around one?twenty for years. Loved salt. Loved to talk Republican, too, and when Nixon left him nothing to say he had kind of burst. Actually, he had lasted a year into Ford, but the skin of his face was getting tighter and the red spots where the cheek and jaw bones pressed from underneath redder. When Harry looked down at him rouged in the coffin he saw it had been coming, dead Fred hadn't much changed. From the way Janice and her mother carried on you would have thought a mixture of Prince Valiant and Moses had bit the dust. Maybe having already buried both his own parents made Harry hard. He looked down, noticed that Fred's hair had been parted wrong, and felt nothing. The great thing about the dead, they make space.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> While old man Springer was still prancing around, life at the lot was hard. He kept long hours, held the showroom open on winter nights when there wasn't a snowplow moving along Route 111, was always grinding away in that little high?pitched grinder of a voice about performance guidelines and washout profits and customer servicing and whether or not a mechanic had left a thumbprint on some heap's steering wheel or a cigarette butt in the ashtray. When he was around the lot it was like they were all trying to fill some big skin that Springer spent all his time and energy imagining, the ideal Springer Motors. When he died that skin became Harry's own, to stand around in loosely. Now that he is king of the lot he likes it here, the acre of asphalt, the new?car smell present even in the pamphlets and pep talks Toyota mails from California, the shampooed carpet wall to wall, the yellowing basketball feats up on the walls along with the plaques saying Kiwanis and Rotary and C of C and the trophies on a high shelf won by the Little League teams the company sponsors, the ample square peace of this masculine place spiced by the girls in billing and reception that come and go under old Mildred Kroust, and the little cards printed with HAROLD C. ANGSTROM on them and CHIEF SALES REPRESENTATIVE. The man up front. A center of sorts, where he had been a forward. There is an airiness to it for Harry, standing there in his own skin, casting a shadow. The cars sell themselves, is his philosophy. The Toyota commercials on television are out there all the time, preying on people's minds. He likes being part of all that; he likes the nod he gets from the community, that had overlooked him like dirt ever since high school. The other men in Rotary and Chamber turn out to be the guys he played ball with back then, or their ugly younger brothers. He likes having money to float in, a big bland good guy is how he sees himself, six three and around two fifteen by now, with a forty?two waist the suit salesman at Kroll's tried to tell him until he sucked his gut in and the man's thumb grudgingly inched the tape tighter. He avoids mirrors, when he used to love them. The face far in his past, crewcut and thin jawed with sleepy predatory teen?age eyes in the glossy team portraits, exists in his present face like the chrome bones of a grille within the full front view of a car and its fenders. His nose is still small and straight, his eyes maybe less sleepy. An ample blown?dry?looking businessman's haircut masks his eartips and fills in where his temples are receding. He didn't much like the counterculture with all its drugs and draft?dodging but he does like being allowed within limits to let your hair grow longer than those old Marine cuts and to have it naturally fluff out. In the shaving mirror a chaos of wattles and slack cords blooms beneath his chin in a way that doesn't bear study. Still, life is sweet. That's what old people used to say and when he was young he wondered how they could mean it.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Last night it hailed in Brewer and its suburbs. Stones the size of marbles leaped up from the slant little front yards and drummed on the tin signs supporting flickering neon downtown; then came a downpour whose puddles reflected a dawn gray as stone. But the day has turned breezy and golden and the patched and whitestriped asphalt of the lot is dry, late in the afternoon of this longest Saturday in June and the first of calendar summer. Usually on a Saturday Route 111 is buzzing with shoppers pillaging the malls hacked from the former fields of corn, rye, tomatoes, cabbages, and strawberries. Across the highway, the four concrete lanes and the median divider of aluminum battered by many forgotten accidents, stands a low building faced in dark clinker brick that in the years since Harry watched its shell being slapped together of plywood has been a succession of unsuccessful restaurants and now serves as the Chuck Wagon, specializing in barbecued take?outs. The Chuck Wagon too seems quiet today. Beyond its lot littered with flattened take?out cartons a lone tree, a dusty maple, drinks from a stream that has become a mere ditch. Beneath its branches a picnic table rots unused, too close to the overflowing dumpster the restaurant keeps by its kitchen door. The ditch marks the bound of a piece of farmland sold off but still awaiting its development. This shapely old maple from its distance seems always to be making to Harry an appeal he must ignore.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He turns from the dusty window and says to Charlie Stavros, "They're running scared out there."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Charlie looks up from the desk where he is doing paperwork, the bill of sale and NV?1 on a '74 Barracuda 8 they finally moved for twenty?eight hundred yesterday. Nobody wants these old guzzlers, though you got to take them on trade?in. Charlie handles the used cats. Though he has been with Springer Motors twice as long as Harry, his desk is in a corner of the showroom, out in the open, and the ride on h15 Card is SENIOR SALES REPRESENTATIVE. Yet he bears no grudge. He sets down his pen even with the edge of his papers and in response to his boss asks, "Did you see in the paper the other day where some station owner and his wife somewhere in the middle of the state were pumping gas for a line and one of the cars slips its clutch and crushes the wife against the car next in line, broke her hip I think I read, and while the husband was holding her and begging for help the people in the cars instead of giving him any help took over the pumps and gave themselves free gas?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah," Harry says, "I guess I heard that on the radio, though it's hard to believe. Also about some guy in Pittsburgh who takes a couple of two?by?fours with him and drives his back wheels up on them so as to get a few more cents' worth of gas in his tank. That's fanatical."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Charlie emits a sardonic, single?syllabled laugh, and explains, "The little man is acting like the oil companies now. I'll get mine, and screw you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't blame the oil companies," Harry says tranquilly. "It's too big for them too. Mother Earth is drying up, is all."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Shit, champ, you never blame anybody," Stavros tells the taller man. "Skylab could fall on your head right now and you'd go down saying the government had done its best."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry tries to picture this happening and agrees, "Maybe so. They're strapped these days like everybody else. About all the feds can do these days is meet their own payroll."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That they're guaranteed to do, the greedy bastards. Listen, Harry. You know damn well Carter and the oil companies have rigged this whole mess. What does Big Oil want? Bigger profits. What does Carter want? Less oil imports, less depreciation of the dollar. He's too chicken to ration, so he's hoping higher prices will do it for him. We'll have dollar?fifty no?lead before the year is out."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> ."And people'll pay it," Harry says, serene in his middle years. The two men fall silent, as if arrived at a truce, while the scared traffic kicks up dust along the business strip of Route 111 and the unbought Toyotas in the showroom exude new?car smell. Ten years ago Stavros had an affair with Harry's wife Janice. Harry thinks of Charlie's prick inside Janice and his feeling is hostile and cozy in almost equal proportions, coziness getting the edge. At the time he took his son?in?law on, old man Springer asked him if he could stomach working with him, Charlie. Rabbit didn't see why not. Sensing he was being asked to bargain, he said he'd work with him, not under him. No question of that, you'd be under me only, as long as I'm among the living, Springer had promised: you two'll work side by side. Side by side then they had waited for customers in all weathers and bemoaned their boss's finickiness and considered monthly which of the used cars on inventory would never move and should be wholesaled to cut carrying costs. Side by side they had suffered with Springer Motors as the Datsun franchise came into the Brewer area, and then those years when everyone was buying VWs and Volvos, and now the Hondas and Le Car presenting themselves as the newest thing in cute economy. In these nine years Harry added thirty pounds to his frame while Charlie went from being a chunky Greek who when he put on his shades and a checked suit looked like an enforcer for the local numbers racket to a shrivelled little tipster?type. Stavros had always had a tricky ticker, from rheumatic fever when he was a boy. Janice had been moved by this, this weakness hidden within him, his squarish chest. Now like a flaw ramifying to the surface of a crystal his infirmity has given him that dehydrated prissy look of a reformed rummy, of a body preserved day to day by taking thought. His eyebrows that used to go straight across like an iron bar have dwindled in to be two dark clumps, disconnected, almost like the charcoal dabs clowns wear. His sideburns have gone white so the top of his tightly wavy hair looks dyed in a broad stripe. Each morning at work Charlie changes his lavender?tinted black hornrims for ones with amber lenses the instant he's indoors, and walks through the day's business like a grizzled old delicate ram who doesn't want to slip on a crag and fall. Side by side, 1 promise you. When old man Springer promised that, when he turned his full earnestness on anything, the pink patches in his face glowed red and his lips tightened back from his teeth so you thought all the more of his skull. Dirty yellow teeth loaded with gum?line fillings, and his sandcolored mustache never looked quite even, or quite clean.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The dead, Jesus. They were multiplying, and they look up begging you to join them, promising it is all right, it is very soft down here. Pop, Mom, old man Springer, Jill, the baby called Becky for her little time, Tothero. Even John Wayne, the other day. The obituary page every day shows another stalk of a harvest endlessly rich, the faces of old teachers, customers, local celebrities like himself flashing for a moment and then going down. For the first time since childhood Rabbit is happy, simply, to be alive. He tells Charlie, "I figure the oil's going to run out about the same time I do, the year two thousand. Seems funny to say it, but I'm glad .I lived when I did. These kids coming up, they'll be living on table scraps. We had the meal."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You've been sold a bill of goods," Charlie tells him. "You and a lot of others. Big Oil has enough reserves located right now to last five hundred years, but they want to ooze it out. In the Delaware Bay right now I heard there's seventeen supertankers, seventeen, at anchor waiting for the prices to go up enough for them to come into the South Philly refineries and unload. Meanwhile you get murdered in gas lines."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Stop driving. Run," Rabbit tells him. "I've begun this jogging thing and it feels great. I want to lose thirty pounds." Actually his resolve to run before breakfast every day, in the dew of the dawn, lasted less than a week. Now he contents himself with trotting around the block after supper sometimes to get away from his wife and her mother while they crab at each other.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He has touched a sore point. Charlie confides as if to the NV?1 form, "Doctor tells me if I try any exercise he washes his hands."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit is abashed, slightly. "Really? That's not what that Doctor Whatsisname used to say. White. Paul Dudley White."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He died. Exercise freaks are dropping down dead in the parks like flies. It doesn't get into the papers because the fitness industry has become big bucks. Remember all those little health?food stores hippies used to run? You know who runs 'em now? General Mills."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry doesn't always know how seriously to take Charlie. He does know, in relation to his old rival, that he is hearty and huge, indisputably preferred by God in this chance matter of animal health. If Janice had run off with Charlie like she wanted to she'd be nothing but a nursemaid now. As is, she plays tennis three, four times a week and has never looked sharper. Harry keeps wanting to downplay himself around Charlie, protecting the more fragile man from the weight of his own good fortune. He keeps silent, while Charlie's mind works its way back from the shame and shadow of his doctor washing his hands, back into memory's reserves of energy. "Gasoline," he suddenly says, giving it that Greek cackle, almost a wheeze. "Didn't we used to burn it up? I had an Imperial once with twin carburetors and when you took off the filter and looked down through the butterfly valve when the thing was idling it looked like a toilet being flushed."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry laughs, wanting to ride along. "Cruising," he says, "after high school got out, there was nothing to do but cruise. Back and forth along Central, back and forth. Those old V?8s, what do you think they got to the gallon? Ten, twelve miles? Nobody ever thought to keep track."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "My uncles still won't drive a little car. Say they don't want to get crumpled if they meet a truck."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Remember Chicken? Funny more kids weren't killed than were."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Cadillacs. If one of his brothers got a Buick with fins, my father had to have a Cadillac with bigger fins. You couldn't count the taillights, it looked like a carton of red eggs."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "There was one guy at Mt. Judge High, Don Eberhardt, 'd get out on the running board of his Dad's Dodge when it was going down the hill behind the box factory and steer from out there. All the way down the hill."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "First car I bought for myself, it was a '48 Studebaker, with that nose that looked like an airplane. Had about sixty?five thousand miles on it, it was the summer of '53. The dig?out on that baby! After a stoplight you could feel the front wheels start to lift, just like an airplane."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Here's a story. One time when we were pretty newly married I got sore at Janice for something, just being herself probably, and drove to West Virginia and back in one night. Crazy. You couldn't do that now without going to the savings bank first."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah," Charlie says slowly, saddened. Rabbit hadn't wanted to sadden him. He could never figure out, exactly, how much the man had loved Janice. "She described that. You did a lot of roaming around then."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "A little. I brought the car back though. When she left me, she took the car and kept it. As you remember."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Do I?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He has never married, and that says something flattering, to Janice and therefore to Harry, the way it's worked out. A man fucks your wife, it puts a new value on her, within limits. Harry wants to restore the conversation to the cheerful plane of dwindling energy. He tells Stavros, "Saw a kind of funny joke in the paper the other day. It said, You can't beat Christopher Columbus for mileage. Look how far he got on three galleons." He pronounces the crucial word carefully, in three syllables; but Charlie doesn't act as if he gets it, only smiles a one?sided twitch of a smile that could be in response to pain.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "The oil companies made us do it," Charlie says. "They said, Go ahead, burn it up like madmen, all these highways, the shopping malls, everything. People won't believe it in a hundred years, the sloppy way we lived."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's like wood," Harry says, groping back through history, which is a tinted fog to him, marked off in centuries like a football field, with a few dates ?1066, 1776 ? pinpointed and a few faces ? George Washington, Hitler ?hanging along the sidelines, not cheering. "Or coal. As a kid I can remember the anthracite rattling down the old coal chute, with these red dots they used to put on it. I couldn't imagine how they did it, I thought it was something that happened in the ground. Little elves with red brushes. Now there isn't any anthracite. That stuff they strip?mine now just crumbles in your hand." It gives him pleasure, makes Rabbit feel rich, to contemplate the world's wasting, to know that the earth is mortal too.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well," Charlie sighs. "At least it's going to keep those chinks from ever having an industrial revolution."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> That seems to wrap it up, though Harry feels they have let something momentous, something alive under the heading of energy, escape. But a lot of topics, he has noticed lately, in private conversation and even on television where they're paid to talk it up, run dry, exhaust themselves, as if everything's been said in this hemisphere. In his inner life too Rabbit dodges among more blanks than there used to be, patches of burnt?out gray cells where there used to be lust and keen dreaming and wide?eyed dread; he falls asleep, for instance, at the drop of a hat. He never used to understand the phrase. But then he never used to wear a hat and now, at the first breath of cold weather, he does. His roof wearing thin, starlight showing through.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> You ASKED FOR IT, WE GOT IT, the big paper banner on the showroom window cries, in tune with the current Toyota television campaign. The sign cuts a slice from the afternoon sun and gives the showroom a muted aquarium air, or that of a wide sunken ship wherein the two Coronas and the acid?green Corolla SR?5 liftback wait to be bought and hoisted into the air on the other side of the glass and set down safe on the surface of the lot and Route 111 and the world of asphalt beyond.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> A car swings in from this world: a fat tired '71 or '2 Country Squire wagon soft on its shocks, with one dented fender hammered out semi?smooth but the ruddy rustproofing underpaint left to do for a finish. A young couple steps out, the girl milky?pale and bare?legged and blinking in the sunshine but the boy roughened and reddened by the sun, his jeans dirt?stiffened by actual work done in the red mud of the county. A kind of crate of rough green boards has been built into the Squire's chrome roof rack and from where Rabbit is standing, a soft wedge shot away, he can see how the upholstery and inner padding have been mangled by the station wagon's use as a farm truck. "Hicks," Charlie says from his desk. The pair comes in shyly, like elongated animals, sniffing the air?conditioned air.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Feeling protective, God knows why, Charlie's snipe ringing in his ears, Harry walks toward them, glancing at the girl's hand to see if she wears a wedding ring. She does not, but such things mean less than they used to. Kids shack up. Her age he puts at nineteen or twenty, the boy a bit older ? the age of his own son. "Can I help you folks?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The boy brushes back his hair, showing a low white forehead. His broad baked face gives him a look of smiling even when he isn't. "We chust came in for some information." His accent bespeaks the south of the county, less aggressively Dutch than the north, where the brick churches get spiky and the houses and barns are built of limestone instead of sandstone. Harry figures them for leaving some farm to come into the city, with no more need to haul fenceposts and hay bales and pumpkins and whatever else this poor heap was made to haul. Shack up, get city jobs, and spin around in a little Corolla. We got it. But the boy could be just scouting out prices for his father, and the girlfriend be riding along, or not even be a girlfriend, but a sister, or a hitchhiker. A little touch of the hooker about her looks. The way her soft body wants to spill from these small clothes, the faded denim shorts and ?purple Paisley halter. The shining faintly freckled flesh of her shoulders and top arms and the busy wanton abundance of her browny?red many?colored hair, carelessly bundled. A buried bell rings. She has blue eyes in deep sockets and the silence of a girl from the country used to letting men talk while she holds a sweetand?sour secret in her mouth, sucking it. An incongruous disco touch in her shoes, with their high cork heels and ankle straps. Pink toes, painted nails. This girl will not stick with this boy. Rabbit wants this to be so; he imagines he feels an unwitting swimming of her spirit upward toward his, while her manner is all stillness. He feels she wants to hide from him, but is too big and white, too suddenly womanly, too nearly naked. Her shoes accent the length of her legs; she is taller than average, and not quite fat, though tending toward chunky, especially around the chest. Her upper lip closes over the lower with a puffy bruised look. She is bruisable, he wants to protect her; he relieves her of the pressure of his gaze, too long by a second, and turns to the boy.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "This is a Corolla," Harry says, slapping orange tin. "The twodoor model begins at thirty?nine hundred and will give you highway mileage up to forty a gallon and twenty to twenty?five city driving. I know some other makes advertise more but believe me you can't get a better buy in America today than this jalopy right here. Read Consumer Reports, April issue. Much better than average on maintenance and repairs through the first four years. Who in this day and age keeps a car much longer than four years? In four years we may all be pushing bicycles the way things are going. This particular car has four?speed synchromesh transmission, fully transistorized ignition system, power?assisted front disc brakes, vinyl reclining bucket seats, a locking gas cap. That last feature's getting to be pretty important. Have you noticed lately how all the autosupply stores are selling out of their siphons? You can't buy a siphon in Brewer today for love nor money, guess why. My mother?in?law's old Chrysler over in Mt. Judge was drained dry the other day in front of the hairdresser's, she hardly ever takes the buggy out except to go to church. People are getting rough. Did you notice in the .paper this morning where Carter is taking gas from the farmers and going to give it to the truckers? Shows the power of a gun, doesn't it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I didn't see the paper," the boy says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He is standing there so stolidly Harry has to move around him with a quick shuffle?step, dodging a cardboard cutout of a happy customer with her dog and packages, to slap acid?green. "Now if you want to replace your big old wagon, that's some antique, with another wagon that gives you almost just as much space for half the running expense, this SR?5 has some beautiful features ? a fivespeed transmission with an overdrive that really saves fuel on a long trip, and a fold?down split rear seat that enables you to carry one passenger back there and still have the long space on the other side for golf clubs or fenceposts or whatever. I don't know why Detroit never thought it, that split seat. Here we're supposed to be Automobile Heaven and the foreigners come up with all the ideas. If you ask me Detroit's let us all down, two hundred million of us. I'd much rather handle native American cars but between the three of us they're junk. They're cardboard. They're pretend."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Now what are those over there?" the boy asks.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's the Corona, if you want to move toward the top of the line. Bigger engine ? twenty?two hundred ccs. Instead of sixteen. More of a European look. I drive one and love it. I get about thirty miles to the gallon on the highway, eighteen or so in Brewer. Depends on how you drive, of course. How heavy a foot you have. Those testers for Consumer Reports, they must really give it the gun, their mileage figures are the one place they seem off to me. This liftback here is priced at sixty?eight five, but remember you're buying yen for dollars, and when trade?in time comes you get your yen back."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The girl smiles at "yen." The boy, gaining confidence, says, "And this one here now." The young farmer has touched the Celica's suave black hood. Harry is running out of enthusiasm. Interested in that, the kid wasn't very interested in buying.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You've just put your hand on one super machine," Harry tells him. "The Celica GT Sport Coupe, a car that'll ride with a Porsche or an MG any day. Steel?belted radials, quartz crystal clock, AM/FM stereo ? all standard. Standard. You can imagine what the extras are. This one has power steering and a sun roof. Frankly, it's pricey, pretty near five figures, but like I say, it's an investment. That's how people buy cars now, more and more.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> 'That old Kleenex mentality of trade it in every two years is gone with the wind. Buy a good solid car now, you'll have something for a long while, while the dollars if you keep 'em will go straight to Hell. Buy good goods, that's my advice to any young man starting up right now."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He must be getting too impassioned, for the boy says, "We're chust looking around, more or less."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I understand that," Rabbit says quickly, pivoting to face the silent girl. "You're under absolutely no pressure from me. Picking a car is like picking a mate ? you want to take your time." The girl blushes and looks away. Generous paternal talkativeness keeps bubbling up in Harry. "It's still a free country, the Commies haven't gotten any further than Cambodia. No way I can make you folks buy until you're good and ready. It's all the same to me, this product sells itself. Actually you're lucky there's such a selection on the floor, a shipment came in two weeks ago and we won't have another until August. Japan can't make enough of these cars to keep the world happy. Toyota is number?one import all over the globe." He can't take his eyes of this girl. Those chunky eyesockets reminding him of somebody. The milky flecked shoulders, the dent of flesh where the halter strap digs. Squeeze her and you'd leave thumbprints, she's that fresh from the oven. "Tell me," he says, "which size're you thinking of? You planning to cart a family around, or just yourselves?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The girl's blush deepens. Don't marry this chump, Harry thinks. His brats will drag you down. The boy says, "We don't need another wagon. My dad has a Chevy pick?up, and he let me take the Squire over when I got out of high school."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "A great junk car," Rabbit concedes. "You can hurt it but you can't kill it. Even in '71 they were putting more metal in than they do now. Detroit is giving up the ghost." He feels he is floating on their youth, on his money, on the brightness of this June afternoon and its promise that tomorrow, a Sunday, will be fair for his golf game. "But for people planning to tie the knot and get serious you need something more than a nostalgia item, you need something more like this." He slaps orange tin again and reads irritation in the cool pallor of the girl's eyes as they lift to his. Forgive me, baby, you get so fucking bored standing around in here, when the time comes you tend to run off at the mouth.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Stavros, forgotten, calls from his desk, across the showroom space awash in sun shafts slowly approaching the horizontal, "Maybe they'd like to take a spin." He wants peace and quiet for his paperwork.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Want to test drive?" Harry asks the couple.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's pretty late," the boy points out.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It'll take a minute. You only pass this way once. Live it up. I'll get some keys and a plate. Charlie, are the keys to the blue Corolla outside hanging on the pegboard or in your desk?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'll get 'em," Charlie grunts. He pushes up from his desk and, still bent, goes into the corridor behind the waist?high partition of frosted glass ? a tacky improvement ordered by Fred Springer toward the end of his life. Behind it, three hollow flush doors in a wall of fake?walnut pressboard open into the offices of Mildred Kroust and the billing girl, whoever she is that month, with the office of the Chief Sales Representative between them. The doors are usually ajar and the girl and Mildred keep crossing back and forth to consult. Harry prefers to stand out here on the floor. In the old days there were just three steel desks and a strip of carpet; the one closed door marked the company toilet with its dispenser of powdered soap you turned upside down to get any out of. Reception now is off in another separate cubicle, adjoining the waiting room where few customers ever wait. The keys Charlie needs hang, among many others, some no longer unlocking anything in this world, on a pegboard darkened by the touch of greasy fingertips beside the door on the way to Parts: Parts, that tunnel of loaded steel shelves whose sliding window overlooks the clangorous cavern of Service. No reason for Charlie to go except he knows where things are and you don't want to leave customers alone for a moment and feeling foolish, they're apt to sneak away. More timid than deer, customers. With nothing to say between them, the boy, the girl, and Harry can hear the faint strained wheeze of Charlie's breathing as he comes back with the demonstrator Corolla keys and the dealer's plate on its rusty spring clip. "Want me to take these youngsters out?" he asks.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No, you sit and rest," Harry tells him, adding, "You might start locking up in back." Their sign claims they are open Saturdays to six but on this ominous June day of gas drought quarter of should be close enough. "Back in a minute."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The boy asks the girl, "Want to come or stay here?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, come," she says, impatience lighting up her mild face as she turns and names him. "Jamie, Mother expects me back."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry reassures her, "It'll just take a minute." Mother. He wishes he could ask her to describe Mother.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Out on the lot, bright wind is bringing summer in. The spots ofgrass around the asphalt sport buttery dabs of dandelion. He clips the plate to the back of the Corolla and hands the boy the keys. He holds the seat on the passenger side forward so the girl can get into the rear; as she does so the denim of her shorts permits a peek of cheek of ass. Rabbit squeezes into the death seat and explains to Jamie the trinkets of the dashboard, including the space where a tape deck could go. They are, all three passengers, on the tall side, and the small car feels stuffed. Yet with imported spunk the Toyota tugs them into rapid motion and finds its place in the passing lane of Route 111. Like riding on the back of a big bumblebee; you feel on top of the buzzing engine. "Peppy," Jamie acknowledges.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And smooth, considering," Harry adds, trying not to brake on the bare floor. To the girl he calls backwards, "You O.K.? Shall I slide my seat forward to give more room?" The way the shorts are so short now you wonder if the crotches don't hurt. The stitching, pinching up.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No I'm all right, I'll sit sideways."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He wants to turn and look at her but at his age turning his head is not so easy and indeed some days he wakes with pains all through the neck and shoulders from no more cause than his dead weight on the bed all night. He tells Jamie, "This is the sixteen hundred cc., they make a twelve hundred base model but we don't like to handle it, I'd hate to have it on my conscience that somebody was killed because he didn't have enough pick?up to get around a truck or something on these American roads. Also we believe in carrying a pretty full complement of options; without 'em you'll find yourself short?changed on the trade?in when the time comes." He manages to work his body around to look at the girl. "These Japanese for all their good qualities have pretty short legs," he tells her. The way she has to sit, her ass is nearly on the floor and her knees are up in the air, these young luminous knees inches from his face.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Unself?consciously she is pulling a few long hairs away from her mouth where they have blown and gazing through the side window at this commercial stretch of greater Brewer. Fast?food huts in eye?catching shapes and retail outlets of everything from bridal outfits to plaster birdbaths have widened the aspect of this, the old Weisertown Pike, with their parking lots, leaving the odd surviving house and its stump of a front lawn sticking out painfully. Competitors ? Pike Porsche and Renault, Diefendorfer Volkswagen, Old Red Barn Mazda and BMW, Diamond County Automotive Imports ? flicker their FUEL ECONOMY banners while the gasoline stations intermixed with their beckoning have shrouded pumps and tow trucks parked across the lanes where automobiles once glided in, were filled, and glided on. An effect of hostile barricade, late in the day. Where did the shrouds come from? Some of them quite smartly tailored, in squared?off crimson canvas. A new industry, gas pump shrouds. Among vacant lakes of asphalt a few small stands offer strawberries and early peas. A tall sign gestures to a cement?block building well off the road; Rabbit can remember when this was a giant Mister Peanut pointing toward a low shop where salted nuts were arrayed in glass cases, Brazil nuts and hazelnuts and whole cashews and for a lesser price broken ones, Diamond County a great area for nuts but not that great, the shop failed. Its shell was broken and doubled in size and made into a nightclub and the sign repainted, keeping the top hat but Mister Peanut becoming a human reveller in white tie and trails. Now after many mutilations this sign has been turned into an ill?fitted female figure, a black silhouette with no bumps indicating clothing, her head thrown back and the large letters D I S C O falling in bubbles as if plucked one by one from her cut throat. Beyond such advertisements the worn green hills hold a haze of vapor and pale fields bake as their rows of corn thicken. The inside of the Corolla is warming with a mingled human smell. Harry thinks of the girl's long thigh as she stretched her way into the back seat and imagines he smells vanilla. Cunt would be a good flavor of ice cream, Sealtest ought to work on it.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The silence from the young people troubles him. He prods it. ?He says, "Some storm last night. I heard on the radio this morning the underpass at Eisenhower and Seventh was flooded for over an hour."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Then he says, "You know it seems gruesome to me, all these gas stations closed up like somebody has died."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Then he says, "Did you see in the paper where the Hershey company has had to lay off nine hundred people because of the truckers' strike? Next thing we'll be in lines for Hershey bars."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The boy is intently passing a Freihofer's Bakery truck and Harry responds for him: "The downtown stores are all pulling out. Nothing left in the middle of the city now but the banks and the post office. They put that crazy stand of trees in to make a mall but it won't do any good, the people are still scared to go downtown."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The boy is staying in the fast lane, and in third gear, either for the pep or because he's forgotten there is a fourth. Harry asks him, "Getting the feel of it, Jamie? If you want to turn around, there's an intersection coming up."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The girl understands. "Jamie, we better turn around. The man wants to get home for supper."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> As Jamie slows to ease right at the intersection, a Pacer ? silliest car on the road, looks like a glass bathtub upside?down ? swings left without looking. The driver is a fat spic in a Hawaiian shirt. The boy slaps the steering wheel in vain search for the horn. Toyota indeed has put the horn in a funny place, on two little arcs a thumb's reach inside the steering?wheel rim; Harry reaches over quick and toots for him. The Pacer swerves back into its lane, with a dark look back above the Hawaiian shirt. Harry directs, `Jamie, I want you to take a left at the next light and go across the highway and take the next left you can and that'll bring us back." To the girl he explains, "Prettier this way." He thinks aloud, "What can I tell you about the car I haven't? It has a lot of locks. Those Japanese, they live on top of each other and are crazy about locks. Don't kid yourselves, we're coming to it, I won't be here to see it, but you will. When I was a kid nobody ever thought to lock their house and now everybody does, except my crazy wife. If she locked the door she'd lose the key. One of the reasons I'd like to go to Japan ? Toyota asks some of their dealers but you got to have a bigger gross than I do ? is to see how you lock up a paper house. At any rate. You can't get the key out of the ignition without releasing this catch down here. The trunk in back releases from this lever. The locking gas cap you already know about. Did either of you hear about the woman somewhere around Ardmore this week who cut into a gas line and the guy behind her got so mad he sneaked his own locking gas cap onto her tank so when she got to the pump the attendant couldn't remove it? They had to tow her away. Serve the bitch right, if you ask me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> They have taken their two lefts and are winding along a road where fields come to the edge so you can see the clumps of red earth still shiny from where the plow turned them, and where what businesses there are ?LAWNMOWERS SHARPENED, PA. DUTCH QUILTS ? seem to stem from an earlier decade than those along Route 111, which runs parallel. On the banks ofthe road, between mailboxes some of which are painted with a heart or hex design, crown vetch is in violet flower. At a crest the elephant?colored gas tanks of Brewer lift into view, and the brick?red rows as they climb Mt. Judge and smudge its side. Rabbit dares ask the girl, "You from around here?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "More toward Galilee. My mother has a farm."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> And is your mother's name Ruth? Harry wants to ask, but doesn't, lest he frighten her, and destroy for himself the vibration of excitement, of possibility untested. He tries to steal another peek at her, to see if her white skin is a mirror, and if the innocent blue in her eyes is his own, but his bulk restrains him, and the tightness of the car. He asks the boy, "You follow the Phillies, Jamie? How about that seven?zip loss last night? You don't see Bowa commit an error that often."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Is Bowa the one with the big salary?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry will feel better when he gets the Toyota out of this moron's hands. Every turn, he can feel the tires pull and the sudden secret widen within him, circle upon circle, it's like seed: seed that goes into the ground invisible and if it takes hold cannot be stopped, it fulfills the shape it was programmed for, its destiny, sure as our death, and shapely. "I think you mean Rose," he answers. "He's not been that much help, either. They're not going anywhere this year, Pittsburgh's the team. Pirates or Steelers, they always win. Take this left, at the yellow blinker. That'll take you right across One Eleven and then you swing into the lot from the back. What's your verdict?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> From the side the boy has an Oriental look ? a big stretch of skin between his red ear and red nose, puffy eyes whose glitter gives away nothing. People who gouge a living out of the dirt are just naturally mean, Harry has always thought. Jamie says, "Like I said we were looking around. This car seems pretty small but maybe that's chust what you're used to."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Want to give the Corona a whirl? That interior feels like a palace after you've been in one of these, you wouldn't think it would, it's only about two centimeters wider and five longer." He marvels at himself, how centimeters trip off his tongue. Another five years with these cars and he'll be talking Japanese. "But you better get used," he tells Jamie, "to a little scaling down. The big old boats have had it. People trade 'em in and we can't give 'em away. Wholesale half of 'em, and the wholesalers turn 'em into windowboxes. The five hundred trade?in I'd allow you on yours is just a courtesy, believe me. We like to help young people out. I think it's a helluva world we're coming to, where a young couple like yourselves can't afford to buy a car or own a home. Ifyou can't get your foot on even the bottom rung of a society geared like this, people are going to lose faith in the system. The Sixties were a lark in the park compared to what we're going to see if things don't straighten out."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Loose stones in the back section of the lot crackle. They pull into the space the Corolla came from and the boy can't find the button to release the key until Harry shows him again. The girl leans forward, anxious to escape, and her breath stirs the colorless hairs on Harry's wrist. His shirt is stuck to his shoulder blades, he discovers standing to his height in the air. All three of them straighten slowly. The sun is still bright but horsetails high in the sky cast doubt upon the weather for tomorrow's golf game after all. "Good driving," he says to Jamie, having given up on any sale. "Come back in for a minute and I'll give you some literature." Inside the showroom the sun strikes the paper banner and makes the letters TI TOD EW show through. Stavros is nowhere to be seen. Harry hands the boy his CHIEF card and asks him to sign the customer register.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Like I said-'the boy begins.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry has lost patience with this escapade. "It doesn't commit you to a blessed thing," he says. "Toyota'll send you a Christmas card is all it means. I'll do it for you. First name James ??"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nunemacher," the boy says warily, and spells it. "R. D. number two, Galilee."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry's handwriting has deteriorated over the years, gained a twitch at the end of his long arm, which yet is not long enough for him to see clearly what he writes. He owns reading glasses but it is his vanity never to wear them in public. "Done," he says, and all too casually turns to the girl. "O.K. young lady, how about you? Same name?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No way," she says, and giggles. "You don't want me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> A boldness sparks in the cool flat eyes. In that way of women she has gone all circles, silly, elusive. When her gaze levels there is something sexy in the fit of her lower lids, and the shadow of insufficient sleep below them. Her nose is slightly snub. "Jamie's our neighbor, I just came along for the ride. I was going to look for a sundress at Kroll's if there was time."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Something buried far back glints toward the light. Today's slant of sun has reached the shelf where the trophies Springer Motors sponsors wait to be awarded; oval embossments on their weightless white?metal surfaces shine. Keep your name, you little cunt, it's still a free country. But he has given her his. She has taken his card from Jamie's broad red hand and her eyes, childishly alight, slip from its lettering to his face to the section of far wall where his old headlines hang yellowing, toasted brown by time. She asks him, "Were you ever a famous basketball player?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The question is not so easy to answer, it was so long ago. He tells her, "In the dark ages. Why do you ask, you've heard the name?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh no," this visitant from lost time gaily lies. "You just have that look."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> When they have gone, the Country Squire swaying off on its soupy shocks, Harry uses the toilet down past Mildred Kroust's door along the corridor half of frosted glass and meets Charlie coming back from locking up. Still, there is pilferage, mysterious discrepancies eating into the percentages. Money is like water in a leaky bucket: no sooner there, it begins to drip. "Whajja think of the girl?" Harry asks the other man, back in the showroom.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "With these eyes, I don't see the girls anymore. If I saw 'em, with my condition I couldn't do anything about it. She looked big and dumb. A lot of leg."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not so dumb as that hick she was with," Harry says. "God when you see what some girls are getting into it makes you want to cry."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Stavros's dark dabs of eyebrows lift. "Yeah? Some could say it was the other way around." He sits down to business at his desk. "Manny get to talk to you about that Torino you took on trade?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Manny is head of Service, a short stooping man with black pores on his nose, as if with that nose he burrows through each day's dirty work. Of course he resents Harry, who thanks to his marriage to Springer's daughter skates around in the sun of the showroom and accepts clunky Torinos on trade?in. "He told me the front end's out of alignment."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Now he thinks in good conscience it should have a valve job. He also thinks the owner turned back the odometer."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What could I do, the guy had the book right in his hand, I couldn't give him less than book value. If I don't give 'em book value Diefendorfer or Pike Porsche sure as hell will."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You should have let Manny check it out, he could have told at a glance it had been in a collision. And if he spotted the odometer monkey business put the jerk on the defensive."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Can't he weight the front wheels enough to hide the shimmy?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Stavros squares his hands patiently on the olive?green top of his desk. "It's a question of good will. The customer you unload that Torino on will never be back, I promise you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Then what's your advice?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Charlie says, "Discount it over to Ford in Pottsville. You had a cushion of nine hundred on that sale and can afford to give away two rather than get Manny's back up. He has to mark up his parts to protect his own department and when they're Ford parts you're carrying a mark?up already. Pottsville'll put a coat of wax on it and make some kid happy for the summer."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Sounds good." Rabbit wants to be outdoors, moving through the evening air, dreaming of his daughter. "If I had my way," he tells Charlie, "we'd wholesale the American makes out of here as fast as they come in. Nobody wants 'em except the blacks and the spics, and even they got to wake up some day."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Charlie doesn't agree. "You can still do well in used, ifyou pick your spots. Fred used to say every car has a buyer somewhere, but you shouldn't allow more on any trade?in than you'd pay cash for that car. It is cash, you know. Numbers are cash, even if you don't handle any lettuce." He tips back his chair, letting his palms screech with friction on the desktop. "When I first went to work for Fred Springer in '63 we sold nothing but second?hand American models, you never saw a foreign car this far in from the coast. The cars would come in off the street and we'd paint 'em and give 'em a tune?up and no manufacturer told us what price to attach, we'd put the price on the windshield in shaving cream and wipe it off and try another if it didn't move inside a week. No import duty, no currency devaluation; it was good clean dog eat dog."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Reminiscence. Sad to see it rotting Charlie's brain. Harry waits respectfully for the mood to subside, then asks as if out of the blue, "Charlie, if I had a daughter, what d'you think she'd look like?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Ugly," Stavros says. "She'd look like Bugs Bunny."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It'd be fun to have a daughter, wouldn't it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Doubt it." Charlie lifts his palms so the legs of his chair slap to the floor. "What d'you hear from Nelson?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry turns vehement. "Nothing much, thank God," he says. "The kid never writes. Last we heard he was spending the summer out in Colorado with this girl he's picked up." Nelson attends college at Kent State, in Ohio, off and on, and has a year's worth of credits still to go before he graduates, though the boy was twentytwo last October.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What kind of girl?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Lordy knows, I can't keep track. Each one is weirder than the last. One had been a teen?age alcoholic. Another told fortunes from playing cards. I think that same one was a vegetarian, but it may have been somebody else. I think he picks 'em to frustrate 'me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't give up on the kid. He's all you've got."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Jesus, what a thought."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You just go ahead. I want to finish up here. I'll lock up."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "O.K., I'll go see what Janice has burned for supper. Want to come take pot luck? She'd be tickled to see you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Thanks, but Manna mou expects me." His mother, getting decrepit herself, lives with Charlie now, in his place on Eisenhower Avenue, and this is another bond between them, since Harry lives with his mother?in?law.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "O.K. Take care, Charlie. See you in Monday's wash."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Take care, champ."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The day is still golden outside, old gold now in Harry's lengthening life. He has seen summer come and go until its fading is one in his heart with its coming, though he cannot yet name the weeds that flower each in its turn through the season, or the insects that also in ordained sequence appear, eat, and perish. He knows that in June school ends and the playgrounds open, and the grass needs cutting again and again if one is a man, and if one is a child games can be played outdoors while the supper dishes tinkle in the mellow parental kitchens, and the moon is discovered looking over your shoulder out of a sky still blue, and a silver blob of milkweed spittle has appeared mysteriously on your knee. Good luck. Car sales peak in June: for a three?hundred?car?a?year dealer like Harry this means upwards of twenty?five units, with twenty?one accounted for already and six selling days to go. Average eight hundred gross profit times twenty?five equals twenty grand minus the twenty?five per cent they estimate for salesmen's compensation both salary and incentives leaves fifteen grand minus between eight and ten for other salaries those cute little cunts come and go in billing one called Cissy a Polack a few years ago they got as far as rubbing fannies easing by in that corridor and the rent that Springer Motors pays itself old man Springer didn't believe in owning anything the banks could own but even he had to pay off the mortgage eventually boy the rates now must kill anybody starting up and the financing double?digit interest Brewer Trust been doing it for years and against the twelve per cent you got to figure the two or three per cent that comes back as loss reserves nobody likes to call it kick?back and the IRS calls it taxable earnings and the upkeep the electricity that Sun 2001 Diagnostic Computer Manny wants would use a lot ofjuice and the power tools they can't even turn a nut on a wheel anymore it has to be pneumatic rrrrrrt and the heat thank God a few months' reprieve from that the fucking Arabs are killing us and the men won't wear sweaters under the coveralls the young mechanics are the worst they say they lose feeling in their fingertips and health insurance there's another killer up and up the hospitals keeping people alive that are really dead like some game they're playing at Medicaid's expense and the advertising he often wonders how much good it does a rule of thumb he read somewhere is one and a half per cent of gross sales but if you look at the Auto Sales page of the Sunday paper you never saw such a jumble just the quiet listing of the prices and the shadow of the dealer like old man Springer said the man he gets known to be at Rotary and in the downtown restaurants and the country club really he should be allowed to take all that off as business expenses the four seventy?five a week he pays himself doesn't take into account the suits to make himself presentable he has to buy three or four a year and not at Kroll's anymore he doesn't like that salesman who measured his fat waist Webb Murkett knows of a little shop on Pine Street that's as good as hand tailoring and then the property taxes and the kids keep throwing stones or shooting BBs at the glass signs outside we ought to go back to wood grouted wood but national Toyota has its specifications, where was he, let's say nine total monthly expenses variable and invariable that leaves four net profit and deduct another thousand from that for inflation and pilferage and the unpredictable that's always there you still have three, fifteen hundred for Ma Springer and fifteen hundred for Janice and him plus the two thousand salary when his poor dead dad used to go off to the print shop at quarter after seven every morning for forty dollars a week and that wasn't considered bad money then. Harry wonders what his father would think if he could only see him now, rich.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> His 1978 Luxury Edition liftback five?door Corona is parked in its space. Called Red Metallic, it is a color more toward brown, like tired tomato soup. If the Japanese have a weakness it is their color sense: their Copper Metallic to Harry's eyes is a creosote brown, the Mint Green Metallic something like what he imagines cyanide to be, and what they called Beige a plain lemon yellow. In the war there used to be all these cartoons showing the Japanese wearing thick glasses and he wonders if it can be true, they don't see too well, all their colors falling in between the stripes of the rainbow. Still, his Corona is a snug machine. Solid big?car feel, padded tilt steering wheel, lumbar support lever for adjustable driver comfort, factory?installed AM/FM/MPX four?speaker radio. The radio is what he enjoys, gliding through Brewer with the windows up and locked and the power?boosted ventilation flowing through and the four corners of the car dinging out disco music as from the four corners of the mind's ballroom. Peppy and gentle, the music reminds Rabbit of the music played on radios when he was in high school, "How High the Moon" with the clarinet breaking away, the licorice stick they used to call it, "Puttin' on the Ritz": city music, not like that country music of the Sixties that tried to take us back and make us better than we are. Black girls with tinny chiming voices chant nonsense words above a throbbing electrified beat and he likes that, the thought of those black girls out of Detroit probably, their boyfriends goofing off on the assembly line, in shimmery tinsel dresses throbbing one color after another as the disco lights spin. He and Janice ought to visit at least the place down Route 111 D I S C O he noticed today for the hundredth time, never dared go in. In his mind he tries to put Janice and the colored girls and the spinning lights all together and they fly apart. He thinks of Skeeter. Ten years ago this small black man came and lived with him and Nelson for a crazy destructive time. Now Skeeter is dead, he learned just this April. Someone anonymous sent him, in a long stamped envelope such as anybody can buy at the post office, addressed in neat block ballpoint printing such as an accountant or a schoolteacher might use, a clipping in the familiar type of the Brewer Vat, where Harry had been a Linotyper until Linotypmg became obsolete:
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> FORMER RESIDENT
<br> 
<br> SLAIN IN PHILLY
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Hubert Johnson, formerly of Brewer, died of gunshot wounds in General Municipal Hospital, Philadelphia, after an alleged shoot?out with police officers.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Johnson was purported to have fired the first shots without provocation upon officers investigating reported violations of sanitation and housing laws in a religious commune supposedly headed by Johnson, whose Messiah Now Freedom Family included a number of black families and young persons.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Numerous complaints had been occasioned among neighbors by their late singing and abrasive behavior. The Messiah Now Freedom Family was located on Columbia Avenue.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Johnson Wanted
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Johnson, last of Plum Street, city, was remembered locally as "Skeeter" and also went under the name of Farasworth. He was wanted here under several complaints, local officials confirmed.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Philadelphia police lieutenant Roman Surpitski informed reporters that he and his men had no choice but to return fire upon Johnson. Fortunately, no officers and no other "commune" members suffered wounds in the exchange.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The office of outgoing Mayor Frank Rizzo declined to comment upon the incident. "We don't come up against as many of these crazies as we used to," Lieutenant Surpitski volunteered.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The clipping had been accompanied by no note. Yet the sender must have known him, known something of his past, and be watching him, as the dead supposedly do. Creepy. Skeeter dead, a certain light was withdrawn from the world, a daring, a promise that all would be overturned. Skeeter had foretold this, his death young. Harry last had seen him heading across a field of corn stubble, among crows gleaning. But that had been so long ago the paper in his hand this last April felt little different from any other news item or from those sports clippings hanging framed in his showroom, about himself. Your selves die too. That part of him subject to Skeeter's spell had shrivelled and been overlaid. In his life he had known up close no other black people and in truth had been beyond all fear and discomfort flattered by the attentions of this hostile stranger descended like an angel; Harry felt he was seen by this furious man anew, as with X?rays. Yet he was surely a madman and his demands inordinate and endless and with him dead Rabbit feels safer.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> As he sits snug in his sealed and well?assembled car the venerable city of Brewer unrolls like a silent sideways movie past his closed windows. He follows 111 along the river to West Brewer, where once he lived with Skeeter, and then cuts over the Weiser Street Bridge renamed after some dead mayor whose name nobody ever uses and then, to avoid the pedestrian mall with fountains and birch trees the city planners put in the broadest two blocks of Weiser to renew the downtown supposedly (the joke was, they planted twice as many trees as they needed, figuring half would die, but in fact almost all of them thrived, so they have a kind of forest in the center of town, where a number of muggings have taken place and the winos and junkies sleep it off), Harry cuts left on Third Street and through some semi?residential blocks of mostly ophthalmologists' offices to the diagonal main drag called Eisenhower, through the sector of old factories and railroad yards. Railroads and coal made Brewer. Everywhere in this city, once the fifth largest in Pennsylvania but now slipped to seventh, structures speak of expended energy. Great shapely stacks that have not issued smoke for half a century. Scrolling cast?iron light stanchions not lit since World War II. The lower blocks of Weiser given over to the sale of the cut?rate and the X?rated and the only new emporium a big windowless enlargement in white brick of Schoenbaum Funeral Directors. The old textile plants given over to discount clothing outlets teeming with a gimcrack cheer of banners FACTORY FAIR and slogans Where the Dollar Is Still a Dollar. These acres of dead railroad track and car shops and stockpiled wheels and empty boxcars stick in the heart of the city like a great rusting dagger. All this had been cast up in the last century by what now seem giants, in an explosion of iron and brick still preserved intact in this city where the sole new buildings are funeral parlors and government offices, Unemployment and join the Army.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Beyond the car yards and the underpass at Seventh that had been flooded last night, Eisenhower Avenue climbs steeply through tight?built neighborhoods of row houses built solid by German workingmen's savings and loans associations, only the fanlights of stained glass immune to the later layers of aluminum awning and Permastone siding, the Polacks and Italians being squeezed out by the blacks and Hispanics that in Harry's youth were held to the low blocks down by the river. Dark youths thinking in languages of their own stare from the triangular stone porches of the old corner grocery stores.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The vanished white giants as they filled Brewer into its grid named these higher streets that Eisenhower crosses for fruits and the seasons of the year: Winter, Spring, Summer, but no Fall Street. For three months twenty years ago Rabbit lived on Summer with a woman, Ruth Leonard. There he fathered the girl he saw today, if that was his daughter. There is no getting away; our sins, our seed, coil back. The disco music shifts to the Bee Gees, white men who have done this wonderful thing of making themselves sound like black women. "Stayin' Alive" comes on with all that amplified throbbleo and a strange nasal whining underneath: the John Travolta theme song. Rabbit still thinks of him as one of the Sweathogs from Mr. Kotter's class but for a while back there last summer the U.S.A. was one hundred per cent his, every twat under fifteen wanting to be humped by a former Sweathog in the back seat of a car parked in Brooklyn. He thinks of his own daughter getting into the back seat of the Corolla, bare leg up to her ass. He wonders if her pubic hair is ginger in color like her mother's was. That curve where a tender entire woman seems an inch away around a kind of corner, where no ugly penis hangs like sausage on the rack, blue?veined. Her eyes his blue: wonderful to think that he has been turned into cunt, a secret message carried by genes all that way through all these comings and goings all these years, the bloody tunnel of growing and living, of staying alive. He better stop thinking about it, it fills him too full of pointless excitement. Some music does that.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Some car with double headlights, a yellow LeMans with that big vertical bar in the middle of the grille, is riding his tail so close he eases over behind a parked car and lets the bastard by: a young blonde with a tipped?up tiny profile is driving. How often that seems to be the case these days, some pushy road?hog you hate turns out to be a little girl at the wheel, who must be somebody's daughter and from the lackadaisical glassy look on her face has no idea ofbeing rude, just wants to get there. When Rabbit first began to drive the road was full of old fogeys going too slow and now it seems nothing but kids in a hell of a hurry, pushing. Let 'em by, is his motto. Maybe they'll kill themselves on a telephone pole in the next mile. He hopes so.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> His route takes him up into the area of the stately Brewer High School, called the Castle, built in 1933, the year of his birth is how he remembers. They wouldn't build it now, no faith in education, indeed they say with zero growth rate approaching there aren't enough students to fill the schools now, they are closing a lot of the elementary schools down. Up this high the city builders had run out of seasons and went to tree names. Locust Boulevard east of the Castle is lined with houses with lawns all around, though the strips between are narrow and dark and rhododendrons die for lack of sun. The better?off live' up here, the bone surgeons and legal eagles and middle management of the plants that never had the wit to go south or have come in since. When Locust begins to curve through the municipal park its name changes to Cityview Drive, though with all the trees that have grown up in time there isn't much view left; Brewer can be seen all spread out really only from the Pinnacle Hotel, now a site of vandalism and terror where once there had been dancing and necking. Something about spics they don't like to see white kids making out, they surround the car and smash the windshield with rocks and slit the clothes off the girl while roughing up the boy. What a world to grow up in, especially for a girl. He and Ruth walked up to the Pinnacle once or twice. The railroad tie steps probably rotted now. She took off her shoes because the high heels dug into the gravel between the railroad ties, he remembers her city?pale feet lifting ahead of him under his eyes, naked just for him it seemed. People satisfied with less then. In the park a World War II tank, made into a monument, points its guns at tennis courts where the nets, even the ones made of playground fencing, keep getting ripped away. The strength these kids use, just to destroy. Was he that way at that age? You want to make a mark. The world seems indestructible and won't let you out. Let 'em by.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> There is a stoplight and, turning left, Harry passes between houses gabled and turreted the way they did early in the century when men wore straw hats and made ice cream by hand and rode bicycles, and then there is a shopping center, where a four?theater movie complex advertises on its sign high up where vandals can't reach it to steal letters ALIEN MOONRAKER MAIN EVENT ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ. None of them does he want to see though he likes the way Streisand's hair frizzes up and that Jewish nose, not just the nose, there is Jewishness in the thrust of her voice that thrills him, must have to do with being the chosen people, they do seem more at home here on Earth, the few he knows, more full of bounce. Funny about Streisand, if she isn't matched up with an Egyptian like Sharif it's with a super Waspy?looking type like Ryan O'Neal; same thing with Woody Allen, nothing Jewish about Diane Keaton, though her hair does frizz come to think of it.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The music stops, the news comes on. A young female voice reads it, with a twang like she knows she's wasting our time. Fuel, truckers. Three?Mile Island investigations continue. Date for Skylab fall has been revised. Somoza in trouble too. Stay of execution of convicted Florida killer denied. Former leader of Great Britain's Liberal Party acquitted of charges of conspiring to murder his former homosexual lover. This annoys Rabbit, but his indignation at this pompous pansy's getting off scot?free dissolves in his curiosity about the next criminal case on the news, this of a Baltimore physician who was charged with murdering a Canada goose with a golf club. The defendant claims, the disinterested female voice twangs on, that he had accidentally struck the goose with a golf ball and then had dispatched the wounded creature with a club to end its misery. The voice concludes, "A mercy killing, or murder most foul?" He laughs aloud, in the car, alone. He'll have to try to remember that, to tell the gang at the club tomorrow. Tomorrow will be a sunny day, the woman reassures him, giving the weather. "And now, the Number One Hit coast to coast, `Hot Stuff,' by the Queen of Disco, Donna Summer!"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Sittin' here eatin' my heart out waitin'
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Waitin' for some lover to call ....
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit likes the chorus where the girls in the background chime in, you can picture them standing around some steamy city corner chewing gum and who knows what else:
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Hot stuff
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> I need hot stuff
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> I want some hot stuf
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> I need hot stuuuuufft?
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Still he liked Donna Summer best in the days when she was doing those records of a woman breathing and panting and sighing like she was coming. Maybe it wasn't her, just some other slim black chick. But he thinks it was her.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The road takes on a number, 422, and curves around the shoulders of Mt. Judge, with a steep drop on the right side and a view of the viaduct that once brought water to the city from the north of the county across the black breadth of the Running Horse River. Two gas stations mark the beginning of the borough of Mt. Judge; instead of keeping on 422 toward Philadelphia Harry steers his Corona off the highway onto Central by the granite Baptist church and then obliquely up Jackson Street and after three blocks right onto Joseph. If he stays on Jackson two more blocks he will pass his old house, one number in from the corner of Maple, but since Pop passed on, after holding on without Mom for a couple ofyears, doing all the yardwork and vacuuming and meals by himself until his emphysema just got too bad and you'd find him sitting in a chair all curled over like a hand sheltering a guttering candle?flame from the wind, Rabbit rarely drives by: the people he and Mim had sold it to had painted the wood trim an awful grape color and hung an ultraviolet plant light in the big front window. Like these young couples in Brewer who think anything goes on a row house, however cute, and they're doing the world a favor by taking it on. Harry hadn't liked the guy's accent, haircut, or leisure suit; he had liked the price he had paid, though: fiftyeight thousand for a place that had cost Mom and Pop forty?two hundred in 1935. It made a nice bundle even with Mim taking her half with her back out to Nevada and the real?estate agents' and lawyers' fees, they just step in everywhere where money's changing hands. He had begged Janice at the time to use the twenty grand to buy a new house, just for them, maybe over in Penn Park in West Brewer, five minutes from the lot. But no, Janice didn't think they should desert Mother: the Springers had taken them in when they had no house, their own house had burned, and their marriage had hit rock bottom and what with Harry being promised to head up new car sales at about the time Pop died and Nelson having had so many shocks already in his life and so many bad aftereffects still smoldering at that end of Brewer, the inquest for Jill and a police investigation and her parents thinking of suing all the way from Connecticut and the insurance company taking forever to come through with the claim because there were suspicious circumstances and poor Peggy Fosnacht having to swear Harry had been with her and so couldn't have set it himself, what with all this it seemed better to lie low, to hide behind the Springer name in the big stucco house, and the weeks had become months and the months years without the young Angstroms going into another place of their own, and then with Fred dying so suddenly and Nelson going off to college there seemed more room and less reason than ever to move. The house, 89 Joseph, always reminds Harry under its spreading trees with its thready lawn all around of the witch's house made out of candy, penuche for the walls and licorice Necco wafers for the thick slate roof. Though the place looks big outside the downstairs is crammed with furniture come down through Ma Springer's people the Koemers and the shades are always half drawn; except for the screened?in back porch and the little upstairs room that had been Janice's when she was a girl and then Nelson's for those five years before he went away to Kent, there isn't a corner of the Springer house where Harry feels able to breathe absolutely his own air.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He circles around into the alley of bluestone grit and puts the Corona into the garage beside the '74 navy?blue Chrysler Newport that Fred got the old lady for her birthday the year before he died and that she drives around town with both hands tight on the wheel, with the look on her face as if a bomb might go off under the hood. Janice always keeps her Mustang convertible parked out front by the curb, where the maple drippings can ruin the top faster. When the weather gets warm she leaves the top down for .nights at a time so the seats are always sticky. Rabbit swings down the overhead garage door and carries up the cement walk through the back yard like twin car headlights into a tunnel his strange consciousness of having not one child now but two.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice greets him in the kitchen. Something's up. She is wearing a crisp frock with pepperminty stripes but her hair is still scraggly and damp from an afternoon of swimming at the club pool. Nearly every day she has a tennis date with some of her girlfriends at the club they belong to, the Flying Eagle Tee and Racquet, a newish organization laid out on the lower slopes of Mt. Judge's woodsy brother mountain with the Indian name, Mt. Pemaquid, and then kills the rest of the afternoon lying at poolside gossiping or playing cards and getting slowly spaced on Spritzers or vodkaand?tonics. Harry likes having a wife who can be at the club so much. Janice is thickening through the middle at the age of fortythree but her legs are still hard and neat. And brown. She was always dark?complected and with July not even here she has the tan of a savage, legs and arms almost black like some little Polynesian in an old Jon Hall movie. Her lower lip bears a trace of zinc oxide, which is sexy, even though he never loved that stubborn slothke set her mouth gets. Her still?wet hair pulled back reveals a high forehead somewhat mottled, like brown paper where water has been dropped and dried. He can tell by the kind of heat she is giving off that she and her mother have been fighting. "What's up now?" he asks.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's been wild," Janice says. "She's in her room and says we should eat without her."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah well, she'll be down. But what's to eat? I don't see anything cooking." The digital clock built into the stove says 6:32.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Harry. Honest to God I was going to shop as soon as I came back and changed out of tennis things but then this postcard was here and Mother and I have been at it ever since. Anyway it's summer, you don't want to eat too much. Doris Kaufmann, I'd give anything to have her serve, she says she never has more than a glass of iced tea for lunch, even in the middle of winter. I thought maybe soup and those cold cuts I bought that you and Mother refuse to touch, they have to be eaten sometime. And the lettuce is coming on in the garden now so fast we must start having salads before it gets all leggy." She had planted a little vegetable garden in the part of the back yard where Nelson's swing set used to be, getting a man from down the block to turn the earth with his Rototiller, the earth miraculously soft and pungent beneath the crust of winter and Janice out there enthusiastic with her string and rake in the gauzy shadows of the budding trees; but now that summer is here and the leafed?out trees keep the garden in the shade and the games at the club have begun she has let the plot go to weeds.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Still, he cannot dislike this brown?eyed woman who has been his indifferent wife for twenty?three years this past March. He is rich because of her inheritance and this mutual knowledge rests adhesively between them like a form of sex, comfortable and sly. "Salad and baloney, my favorite meal," he says, resigned. "Lemme have a drink first. Some window?shoppers came in to the lot today just as I was leaving. Tell me what postcard."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> As he stands by the refrigerator making a gin?and?bitter?lemon, knowing these sugary mixers add to the calories in the alcohol and help to keep him overweight but figuring that this Saturday evening meal in its skimpiness will compensate and maybe he'll jog a little afterwards, Janice goes in through the dark dining room into the musty front parlor where the shades are drawn and Ma Springer's sulking spirit reigns, and brings back a postcard. It shows a white slope of snow under a stark blue wedge of sky; two small dark hunched figures are tracing linked S's on the slanted snow, skiing. GREETINGS FROM COLORADO red cartoon letters say across the sky that looks like blue paint. On the opposite side a familiar scrawled hand, scrunched as if something in the boy had been squeezed too tight while his handwriting was coming to birth, spells out:
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Hi Mom &amp; Dad &amp; Grandmom:
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> These mts. make Mt. Judge look sick! No snow tho, just plenty of grass (joke). Been learning to hang glide. Job didn't work out, guy was a bum. Penna. beckons. OK if I bring Melanie home too? She could get job and be no troble. Love,
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Melanie?" Harry asks.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's what Mother and I have been fighting about. She doesn't want the girl staying here."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Is this the same girl he went out there with two weeks ago?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I was wondering," Janice says. "She had a name more like Sue or Jo or something."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Where would she sleep?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well, either in that front sewing room or Nelson's room."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "With the kid?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well really, Harry, I wouldn't be utterly surprised. He is twenty?two. When have you gotten so Puritanical?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'm not being Puritanical, just practical. It's one thing to have these kids go off into the blue and go hang gliding or whatever else and another to have them bring all their dope and little tootsies back to the nest. This house is awkward upstairs, you know that. There's too much hall space and you can't sneeze or fart or fuck without everybody else hearing; it's been bliss, frankly, with just us and Ma. Remember the kid's radio all through high school to two in the morning, how he'd fall asleep to it? That bed of his is a little single, what are we supposed to do, buy him and Melody a double bed?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Melanie. I don't know, she can sleep on the floor. They all have sleeping bags. You can try putting her in the sewing room but I know she won't stay there. We wouldn't have." Her blurred dark eyes gaze beyond him into time. "We spent all our energy sneaking down hallways and squirming around in the back seats of cars and I thought we could spare our children that."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have a child, not children," he says coldly, as the gin expands his inner space. They had children once, but their infant daughter Becky died. It was his wife's fault. The entire squeezed and cut?down shape of his life is her fault; at every turn she has been a wall to his freedom. "Listen," he says to her, "I've been trying to get out of this fucking depressing house for years and I don't want this shiftless arrogant goof?off we've raised coming back and pinning me in. These kids seem to think the world exists to serve them but I'm sick of just standing around waiting to be of service."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice stands up to him scarcely flinching, armored in her country?club tan. "He is our son, Harry, and we're not going to turn away a guest of his because she is female in sex. If it was a boyfriend of Nelson's you wouldn't be at all this excited, it's the fact that it's a girlfriend of Nelson's that's upsetting you, a girlfriend of Nelson's. If it was a girlfriend of yours, the upstairs wouldn't be too crowded for you to fart in. This is my son and I want him here if he wants to be here."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't have any girlfriends," he protests. It sounds pitiful. Is Janice saying he should have? Women, once sex gets out in the open, they become monsters. You're a creep ifyou fuck them and a creep if you don't. Harry strides into the dining room, making the glass panes of the antique breakfront shudder, and calls up the dark stained stairs that are opposite the breakfront, "Hey Bessie, come on down! I'm on your side!"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> There is a silence as from God above and then the creak of a bed being relieved of a weight, and reluctant footsteps slither across the ceiling toward the head of the stairs. Mrs. Springer on her painful dropsical legs comes down talking: "This house is legally mine and that girl is not spending one night under a roof Janice's father slaved all his days to keep over our heads."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The breakfront quivers again; Janice has come into the dining room. She says in a voice tightened to match her mother's, "Mother, you wouldn't be keeping this enormous roof over your head if it weren't for Harry and me sharing the upkeep. It's a great sacrifice on Harry's part, a man of his income not having a house he can call his own, and you have no right to forbid Nelson to come home when he wants to, no right, Mother."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The plump old lady groans her way down to the landing three steps shy of the dining?room floor and hesitates there saying, in a voice tears have stained, "Nellie I'm happy to see whenever he deems fit, I love that boy with all my soul even though he hasn't turned out the way his grandfather and I had hoped."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice says, angrier in proportion as the old lady makes herself look pathetic, "You're always bringing Daddy in when he can't speak for himself but as long as he was alive he was very hospitable and tolerant of Nelson and his friends. I remember that cookout Nelson had in the back yard for his high?school graduation when Daddy had had his first stroke already, I went upstairs to see if it was getting too rowdy for him and he said with his wry little smile" ?tears now stain her own voice too ? " `The sound of young voices does my old heart good."'
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> That slippery?quick salesman's smile of his, Rabbit can see it still. Like a switchblade without the click.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "A cookout in the back yard is one thing," Mrs. Springer says, thumping herself in her dirty aqua sneakers down the last three steps of the stairs and looking her daughter level in the eye. "A slut in the boy's bed is another."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry thinks this is pretty jazzy for an old lady and laughs aloud. Janice and her mother are both short women; like two doll's heads mounted on the same set of levers they turn identically chocolateeyed, slot?mouthed faces to glare at his laugh. "We don't know the girl is a slut," Harry apologizes. "All we know is her name is Melanie instead of Sue."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You said you were on my side," Mrs. Springer says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I am, Ma, I am. I don't see why the kid has to come storming home; we gave him enough money to get him started out there, I'd? like to see him get some kind of grip on the world. He's not going to get it hanging around here all summer."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, money," Janice says. "That's all you ever think about. And what have you ever done except hang around here? Your father got you one job and my father got you another, I don't call that any great adventure."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's not all I think about," he begins lamely, of money, before his mother?in?law interrupts.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Harry doesn't want a home of his own," Ma Springer tells her daughter. When she gets excited and fearful of not making herself understood her face puffs up and goes mottled. "He has such disagreeable associations from the last time you two went out on your own."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice is firm, younger, in control. "Mother, you know nothing about it. You know nothing about life period. You sit in this house and watch idiotic game shows and talk on the phone to what friends you have that are still alive and then sit in judgment on Harry and me. You know nothing of life now. You have no idea."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "As if playing games at a country club with the nickel rich and coming home tiddled every night is enough to make you wise," the old lady comes back, holding on with one hand to the knob of the newel post as if to ease the pain in her ankles. "You come home," she goes on, "too silly to make your husband a decent supper and then want to bring this tramp into a house where I do all the housekeeping, even if I can scarcely stand to stand. I'm the one that would be here with them, you'd be off in that convertible. What will the neighbors make of it? What about the people in the church?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't care even if they care, which I dare say they won't," Janice says. "And to bring the church into it is ridiculous. The last minister at St. John's ran off with Mrs. Eckenroth and this one now is so gay I wouldn't let my boy go to his Sunday school, if I had a boy that age."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nellie didn't go that much anyway," Harry recalls. "He said it gave him headaches." He wants to lower the heat between the two women before it boils over into grief. He sees he must break this up, get a house of his own, before he runs out of gas. Stone outside, exposed beams inside, and a sunken living room: that is his dream.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Melanie," his mother?in?law is saying, "what kind of name is that? It sounds colored."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh Mother, don't drag out all your prejudices. You sit and giggle at the Jeffersons as if you're one of them and Harry and Charlie unload all their old gas?hogs on the blacks and if we take their money we can take what else they have to offer too."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Can Melanie actually be black? Harry is asking himself, thrilled. Little cocoa babies. Skeeter would be so pleased.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Anyway," Janice is going on, looking frazzled suddenly, "nobody's said the girl is black, all we know is she hang glides."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Or is that the other one?" Harry asks.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "If she comes, I go," Bessie Springer says. "Grace Stuhl has all those empty rooms now that Ralph's passed on and she's more than once said we should team up."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Mother, I find that humiliating, that you've been begging Grace Stuhl to take you in."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I haven't been begging, the thought just naturally occurred to the both of us. I'd expect to be bought out here, though, and the values in the neighborhood have been going way up since they banned the through truck traffic."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Mother. Harry hates this house."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He says, still hoping to calm these waters, "I don't hate it, exactly; I just think the space upstairs -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Harry," Janice says. "Why don't you go out and pick some lettuce from the garden like we said? Then we'll eat."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Gladly. He is glad to escape the house, the pinch of the women, their heat. Crazy the way they flog at each other with these ghosts of men, Daddy dead, Nelson gone, and even Harry himself a kind of ghost in the way they talk of him as if he wasn't standing right there. Day after day, mother and daughter sharing that same house, it's not natural. Like water blood must run or grow a scum. Old lady Springer always plump with that sausage look to her wrists and ankles but now her face puffy as well like those movie stars whose cheeks they stuff cotton up into to show them getting older. Her face not just plumper but wider as if a screw turning inside is spreading the sides of her skull apart, her eyes getting smaller, Janice heading the same way though she tries to keep trim, there's no stopping heredity. Rabbit notices now his own father talking in his own brain sometimes when he gets tired.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Bitter lemon fading in his mouth, an aluminum colander pleasantly light in his hand, he goes down the brick back steps into grateful space. He feels the neighborhood filter through to him and the voices in his brain grow still. Dark green around him is damp with coming evening, though this long day's lingering brightness surprises his eye above the shadowy masses of the trees. Rooftops and dormers notch the blue as it begins to blush brown; here also electric wires and television aerials mar with their scratches the soft beyond, a few swallows dipping as they do at day's end in the middle range of air above the merged back yards, where little more than a wire fence or a line of hollyhocks marks the divisions of property. When he listens he can hear the sounds of cooking clatter or late play, alive in this common realm with a dog's bark, a bird's weep weep, the rhythmic far tapping of a hammer. A crew of butch women has moved in a few houses down and they're always out in steel?toed boots and overalls with ladders and hammers fixing things, they can do it all, from rain gutters to cellar doors: terrific. He sometimes waves to them when he jogs by in twilight but they don't have much to say to him, a creature of another species.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit swings open the imperfect little gate he constructed two springs ago and enters the fenced rectangle of silent vegetable presences. The lettuce flourishes between a row of bean plants whose leaves are badly bug?eaten and whose stems collapse at a touch and a row of feathery carrot tops all but lost in an invasion of plantain and chickweed and purselane and a pulpy weed with white?and?yellow flowers that grows inches every night. It is easy to pull, its roots let go docilely, but there are so many he wearies within minutes of pulling and shaking the moist earth free from the roots and laying bundles of the weed along the chicken?wire fence as mulch and as barrier to the invading grasses. Grass that won't grow in the lawn where you plant it comes in here wild to multiply. Seed, so disgustingly much of it, Nature such a cruel smotherer. He thinks again of the dead he has known, the growingly many, and of the live child, if not his then some other father's, who visited him today with her long white legs propped up on cork heels, and of the other child, undoubtedly his, the genes show even in that quick scared way he looks at you, who has threatened to return. Rabbit pinches off the bigger lettuce leaves (but not the ones at the base so big as to be tough and bitter) and looks into his heart for welcome, welcoming love for his son. He finds instead a rumple of apprehensiveness in form and texture like a towel tumbled too soon from the dryer. He finds a hundred memories, some vivid as photographs and meaningless, snapped by the mind for reasons of its own, and others mere facts, things he knows are true but has no snapshot for. Our lives fade behind us before we die. He changed the boy's diapers in the sad apartment high on Wilbur Street, he lived with him for some wild months in an apple?green ranch house called 26 Vista Crescent in Penn Villas, and here at 89 Joseph he watched him become a high?school student with a wispy mustache that showed when he stood in the light, and a headband like an Indian's instead of getting a haircut, and a fortune in rock records kept in the sunny room whose drawn shades are above Harry's head now. He and Nelson have been through enough years together to turn a cedar post to rot and yet his son is less real to Harry than these crinkled leaves of lettuce he touches and plucks. Sad. Who says? The calm eyes of the girl who showed up at the lot today haunt the growing shadows, a mystery arrived at this time of his own numb life, death taking his measure with the invisible tapping of that neighborhood hammer: each day he is a little less afraid to die. He spots a Japanese beetle on a bean plant leaf and with a snap of his fingernail ? big fingernails, with conspicuous cuticle moons ? snaps the iridescent creature off: Die.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Back in the house, Janice exclaims, "You've picked enough for six of us!"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Where'd Ma go?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She's in the front hall, on the telephone to Grace Stuhl. Really, she's impossible. I really think senility is setting in. Harry, what shall we do?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Ride with the punches?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, great."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well honey it is her house, not ours and Nelson's."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, drop dead. You're no help." An illumination rises sluggishly within her sable, gin?blurred eyes. "You don't want to be any help," she announces. "You just like to see us fight."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The evening passes in a stale crackle of television and suppressed resentment. Waitin' for some lover to call .... Ma Springer, having condescended to share with them at the kitchen table some lumpy mushroom soup Janice has warmed and the cold cuts slightly sweaty from waiting too long in the refrigerator and all that salad he picked, stalks upstairs to her own room and shuts the door with a firmness that must carry out into the neighborhood as far as the butch women's house. A few cars, looking for hot stuff, prowl by on Joseph Street, with that wet?tire sound that makes Harry and Janice feel alone as on an island. For supper they opened a halfgallon of Gallo Chablis and Janice keeps drifting into the kitchen to top herself up, so that by ten o'clock she is lurching in that way he hates. He doesn't blame people for many sins but he does hate uncoórdination, the root of all evil as he feels it, for without coordination there can be no order, no connecting. In this state she bumps against doorframes coming through and sets her glass on the sofa arm so a big translucent lip of contents slops up and over into the fuzzy gray fabric. Together they sit through Battlestar Galactica and enough of The Love Boat to know it's not one of the good cruises. When she gets up to fill her glass yet again he switches to the Phillies game. The Phillies are being held to one hit by the Expos, he can't believe it, all that power. On the news, there is rioting in Levittown over gasoline, people are throwing beer bottles full of gasoline; they explode, it looks like old films of Vietnam or Budapest but it is Levittown right down the road, north of Philadelphia. A striking trucker is shown holding up a sign saying To HELL WITH SHELL. And Three?Mile Island leaking radioactive neutrons just down the road in the other direction. The weather for tomorrow looks good, as a massive high continues to dominate from the Rocky Mountain region eastward all the way to Maine. Time for bed.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry knows in his bones, it has been borne in on him over the years, that on the nights of the days when Janice has fought with her mother and drunk too much she will want to make love. The first decade of their marriage, it was hard to get her to put out, there were a lot of things she wouldn't do and didn't even know were done and these seemed to be the things most on Rabbit's mind, but then with the affair with Charlie Stavros opening her up at about the time of the moon shot, and the style of the times proclaiming no holds barred, and for that matter death eating enough into her body for her to realize it wasn't such a precious vessel and there wasn't any superman to keep saving it for, Harry has no complaints. Indeed what complaints there might be in this line would come from her about him. Somewhere early in the Carter administration his interest, that had been pretty faithful, began to wobble and by now there is a real crisis of confidence. He blames it on money, on having enough at last, which has made him satisfied all over; also the money itself, relaxed in the bank, gets smaller in real value all the time, and this is on his mind, what to do about it, along with everything else: the Phils, and the dead, and golf. He has taken the game up with a passion since they joined the Flying Eagle, without getting much better at it, or at least without giving himself any happier impression of an absolute purity and power hidden within the coiling of his muscles than some lucky shots in those first casual games he played once did. It is like life itself in that its performance cannot be forced and its underlying principle shies from being permanently named. Arms like ropes, he tells himself sometimes, with considerable success, and then, when that goes bad, shift the weight. Or, Don't chicken?wing it, or, Keep the angle, meaning the angle between club and arms when wrists are cocked. Sometimes he thinks it's all in the hands, and then in the shoulders, and even in the knees. When it's in the knees he can't control it. Basketball was somehow more instinctive. If you thought about merely walking down the street the way you think about golf you'd wind up falling off the curb. Yet a good straight drive or a soft chip stiff to the pin gives him the bliss that used to come thinking of some woman, imagining if only you and she were alone on a warm island.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Naked, Janice bumps against the doorframe from their bathroom back into their bedroom. Naked, she lurches onto the bed where he is trying to read the July issue of Consumer Reports and thrusts her tongue into his mouth. He tastes Gallo, baloney, and toothpaste while his mind is still trying to sort out the virtues and failings of the great range of can openers put to the test over five close pages of print. The Sunbeam units were most successful at opening rectangular and dented cans and yet pierced coffee cans with such force that grains of coffee spewed out onto the counter. Elsewhere, slivers of metal were dangerously produced, magnets gripped so strongly that the contents of the cans tended to spatter, blades failed to reach deep lips, and one small plastic insert so quickly wore away that the model (Ekco C865K) was judged Not Acceptable. Amid these fine discriminations Janice's tongue like an eyeless eager eel intrudes and angers him. Ever since in her late thirties she had her tubes burned to avoid any more bad side effects from the Pill, a demon ofloss (never any more children never ever) has given her sexuality a false animation, a thrust somehow awry. Her eyes as her face backs off from the kiss he has resisted, squirming, have in them no essential recognition of him, only a glaze of liquor and blank unfriendly wanting. By the light by which he had been trying to read he sees the hateful aged flesh at the base of her throat, reddish and tense as if healed from a bum. He wouldn't see it so clearly if he didn't have his reading glasses on. "Jesus," he says, "at least let's wait till I turn out the light."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I like it on." Her insistence is slurred. "I like to see all the gray hair on your chest."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> This interests him. "Is there much?" He tries to see, past his chin. "It's not gray, it's just blond, isn't it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice pulls the bedsheet down to his waist and crouches to examine him hair by hair. Her breasts hang down so her nipples, bumply in texture like hamburger, sway an inch above his belly. "You do here, and here." She pulls each gray hair.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Ouch. Damn you, Janice. Stop." He pushes his stomach up so her nipples vanish and her breasts are squashed against her own frail ribs. Gripping the hair of her head in one fist in his rage at being invaded, the other hand still holding the magazine in which he was trying to read about magnets gripping, he arches his spine so she is thrown from his body to her side of the bed. In her boozy haze mistaking this for love play, Janice tugs the sheet down still lower on him and takes his prick in a fumbling, twittering grip. Her touch is cold from having just washed her hands in the bathroom. The next page of Consumer Reports is printed on blue and asks, Summer cooling, 1979: air?conditioner orfan? He tries to skim the list of advantages and disadvantages peculiar to each (Bulky and heavy to install as opposed to Light and portable, Expensive to run as against Inexpensive to run, the fan seems to be scoring all the points) but can't quite disassociate himself from the commotion below his Waist, where Janice's anxious fingers seem to be asking the same question over and over, without getting the answer they want. Furious, he throws the magazine against the wall behind which Ma Springer sleeps. More carefully, he removes his reading glasses and puts them in his bedside table drawer and switches off the bedside lamp.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> His wife's importunate flesh must then compete with the sudden call to sleep that darkness brings. It has been a long day. He was awake at six?thirty and got up at seven. His eyelids have grown too thin to tolerate the early light. Even now near midnight he feels tomorrow's early dawn rotating toward him. He recalls again the blue?eyed apparition who seemed to be his and Ruth's genes mixed; he is reminded then from so long ago of that Ruth whom he fucked upwards the first time, saying "Hey" in his surprise at her beauty, her body one long underbelly erect in light from the streetlamp outside on Summer Street, his prick erect in her ripe, ripe loveliness above him, Hey, it seems a melancholy falling that an act so glorious has been dwindled to this blurred burrowing of two old bodies, one drowsy and one drunk. Janice's rummaging at his prick has become hostile now as it fails to rise; her attention burns upon it like solar rays focused by a magnifying glass upon a scrap of silk, kids used to kill ants that way. Harry watched but never participated. We are cruel enough without meaning to be. He resents that in her eagerness for some dilution of her sense of being forsaken, having quarrelled with her mother, and perhaps also afraid of their son's return, Janice gives him no space of secrecy in which blood can gather as it did behind his fly in ninth?grade algebra sitting beside Lotty Bingaman who in raising her hand to show she had the answers showed him wisps of armpit hair and pressed the thin cotton of her blouse tighter against the elastic trusswork of her bra, so its salmon color strained through. Then the fear was the bell would ring and he would have tó stand with this hard?on.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He resolves to suck Janice's tits, to give himself a chance to pull himself together, this is embarrassing. A pause at the top, you need a pause at the top to generate momentum. His spit glimmers within her dark shape above him; the headboard of their bed is placed between two windows shaded from the light of sun and moon alike by a great copper beech whose leaves yet allow a little streetlight through.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That feels nice." He wishes she wouldn't say this. Nice isn't enough. Without some shadow of assault or outrage it becomes another task, another duty. To think, all along, that Lotty was sitting there itching to be fucked. It wasn't just him. She was holding a dirty yearning between her legs just like the lavatory walls said, those drawings and words put there by the same kids who magnified the ants to death, that little sticky pop they died with, you could hear it, did girls too make a little sticky noise when they opened up? The thought of her knowing when she raised her hand that her blouse was tugged into wrinkles all pointing to the tip of her tit and that an edge of bra peeped out through the cotton armhole with those little curly virgin hairs and that he was watching for it all to happen does make blood gather. In the fumbly worried dark, with Ma Springer sleeping off her sulk a thickness of plaster away, Harry as if casually presents his stiffened prick to Janice's hand. Hot stuuuuf.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> But wanderings within her own brain have blunted her ardor and her touch conveys this, it is too heavy, so in a desperate mood of self?rescue he hisses "Suck" in her ear, "Suck." Which she does, turning her back, her head heavy on his belly. Diagonal on the bed he stretches one arm as if preparing to fly and caresses her ass, these lower globes of hers less spherical than once they were, and the fur between more findable by his fingers. She learned to blow when she went away with Stavros but doesn't really get her head into it, nibbles more, the top inch or two. To keep himself excited he tries to remember Ruth, that exalted "Hey" and the way she swallowed it once, but the effort brings back with such details the guilt of their months together and, betrayal betrayed, his desertion and the final sour sorrow of it all.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice lets him slide from her mouth and asks, "What are you thinking about?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Work," he lies. "Charlie worries me. He's taking such good care of himself you hate to ask him to do anything. I seem to handle most of the customers now."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well why not? You give yourself twice the salary he gets and he's been there forever."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah, but I married the boss's daughter. He could have, but didn't."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Marriage wasn't our thing," Janice says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What was?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Never mind."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Absentmindedly he strokes her long hair, soft from all that swimming, as it flows on his abdomen. "Pair of kids came into the lot late today," he begins to tell her, then thinks better of it. Now 'that her sexual push is past, his prick has hardened, the competing muscles of anxiety having at last relaxed. But she, she is relaxed all over, asleep with his prick in her face. "Want me inside?" he asks softly, getting no answer. He moves her off his chest and works her inert body around so they lie side by side and he can fuck her from behind. She wakes enough to cry "Oh" when he penetrates. Slickly admitted, he pumps slowly, pulling the sheet up over them both. Not hot enough yet for the fan versus air?conditioner decision, both are tucked around the attic somewhere, back under the dusty eaves, strain your back lifting it out, he has never liked the chill of air?conditioning even when it was only to be had at the movies and thought to be a great treat drawing you in right off the hot sidewalk, the word COOL in blue?green with icicles on the marquee, always seemed to him healthier to live in the air God gave however lousy and let your body adjust, Nature can adjust to anything. Still, some of these nights, sticky, and the cars passing below with that wet?tire sound, the kids with their windows open or tops down and radios blaring just at the moment of dropping off to sleep, your skin prickling wherever it touched cloth and a single mosquito alive in the room. His prick is stiff as stone inside a sleeping woman. He strokes her ass, the crease where it nestles against his belly, must start jogging again, the crease between its halves and that place within the crease, opposite of a nipple, dawned on him gradually over these years that she had no objection to being touched there, seemed to like it when she was under him his hand beneath her bottom. He touches himself too now and then to test if he is holding hard; he is, thick as a tree where it comes up out of the grass, the ridges of the roots, her twin dark moons swallowing and letting go, a little sticky sound. The long slack oily curve of her side, ribs to hip bone, floats under his fingertips idle as a gull's glide. Love has lulled her, liquor has carried her off. Bless that dope. "Jan?" he whispers. "You awake?" He is not displeased to be thus stranded, another consciousness in bed is a responsibility, a snag in the flow of his thoughts. Further on in that issue an article How to shop for a car loan he ought to look at for professional reasons though it's not the sort of thing that interests him, he can't get it out ofhis head how they noticed those coffee grounds that jump out of the can when punctured. Janice snores: a single rasp ofbreath taken underwater, at some deep level where her nose becomes a harp. Big as the night her ass unconscious wraps him all around in this room where dabs of streetlight sifted by the beech shuffle on the ceiling. He decides to fuck her, the stiffness in his cock is killing him. His hard?on was her idea anyway. The Japanese beetle he flicked away comes into his mind as a model of delicacy. Hold tight, dream girl. He sets three fingers on her flank, the pinky lifted as in a counting game. He is stealthy so as not to wake her but single in his purpose, quick, and pure. The climax freezes his scalp and stops his heart, all stealthy; he hasn't come with such a thump in months. So who says he's running out of gas?
<br>

<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I hit the ball O.K.," Rabbit says next afternoon, "but damned if I could score." He is sitting in green bathing trunks at a white outdoor table at the Flying Eagle Tee and Racquet Club with the partners of his round and their wives and, in the case of Buddy Inglefinger, girlfriend. Buddy had once had a wife too but she left him for a telephone lineman down near West Chester. You could see how that might happen because Buddy's girlfriends are sure a sorry lot.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "When did you ever score?" Ronnie Harrison asks him so loudly heads in the swimming pool turn around. Rabbit has known Ronnie for thirty years and never liked him, one of those locker?room show?offs always soaping himself for everybody to see and giving the JVs redbellies and out on the basketball court barging around all sweat and elbows trying to make up in muscle what he lacked in style. Yet when Harry and Janice joined Flying Eagle there old Ronnie was, with a respectable job at Schuylkill Mutual and this nice proper wife who taught third grade for years and must be great in bed, because that's all Ronnie ever used to talk about, he was like frantic on the subject, in the locker room. His kinky brass?colored hair, that began to thin right after high school, is pretty thoroughly worn through on top now, and the years and respectability have drained some pink out of him; the skin from his temples to the comers of his eyes is papery and bluish, ?and Rabbit doesn't remember that his eyelashes were white. He likes playing golf with Ronnie because he loves beating him, which isn't too hard: he has one of those herky jerky punch swings short stocky guys gravitate toward and when he gets excit-ed he tends to roundhouse a big banana right into the woods.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I heard Harry was a big scorer," Ronnie's wife Thelma says softly. She has a narrow forgettable face and still wears that quaint old?fashioned kind of one?piece bathing suit with a little pleated skirt. Often she has a towel across her shoulders or around her ankles as if to protect her skin from the sun; except for her sunburnt nose she is the same sallow color all over. Her wavy mousy hair is going gray strand by strand. Rabbit can never look at her without wondering what she must do to keep Harrison happy. He senses intelligence in her but intelligence in women has never much interested him.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I set the B?league county scoring record in 1951," he says, to defend himself, and to defend himself further adds, "Big deal."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's been broken long since," Ronnie feels he has to explain. "By blacks."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Every record has," Webb Murkett interposes, being tactful. "I don't know, it seems like the miles these kids run now have shrunk. In swimming they can't keep the record books up to date." Webb is the oldest man of their regular foursome, fifty and then some ? a lean thoughtful gentleman in roofing and siding contracting and supply with a canning gravel voice, his long face broken into longitudinal strips by creases and his hazel eyes almost lost under an amber tangle of eyebrows. He is the steadiest golfer, too. The one unsteady thing about him, he is on his third wife; this is Cindy, a plump brown?backed honey still smelling of high school, though they have two little ones, a boy and a girl, ages five and three. Her hair is cut short and lies wet in one direction, as if surfacing from a dive, and when she smiles her teeth look unnaturally even and white in her tan face, with pink spots of peeling on the roundest part of her cheeks; she has an exciting sexually neutral look, though her boobs slosh and shiver in the triangular little hammocks of her bra. The suit is one of those minimal black ones with only a string or two between the nape of her neck and where her ass begins to divide, a cleft more or less visible depending on the sag of her black diaper. Harry admires Webb. Webb always swings within himself, and gets good roll.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Better nutrition, don't you think that's it?" Buddy Inglefinger's girl pipes up, in a little?girl reedy voice that doesn't go with her pushed?in face. She is some kind of physical therapist, though her own shape isn't too great. The girls Buddy brings around are a good lesson to Harry in the limits of being single ?hard little secretaries and restaurant hostesses, witchy?looking former flower children with grizzled ponytails and flat chests full of Navajo jewelry, overweight assistant heads of personnel in one of those grim new windowless office buildings a block back from Weiser where they spend all day putting computer print?outs in the wastebasket. Women pickled in limbo, their legs chalky and their faces slightly twisted, as if they had been knocked into their thirties by a sideways blow. They remind Harry somehow ofpirates, jaunty and maimed, though without the eye patches. What the hell was this one's name? She had been introduced around not a half hour ago, but when everybody was still drunk on golf.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buddy brought her, so he can't let her two cents hang up there while the silence gets painful. He fills in, "My guess is it's mostly in the training. Coaches at even the secondary level have all these techniques that in the old days only the outstanding athlete would discover, you know, pragmatically. Nowadays the outstanding isn't that outstanding, there's a dozen right behind him. Or her." He glances at each of the women in a kind of dutiful tag. Feminism won't catch him off guard, he's traded jabs in too many singles bars. "And in countries like East Germany or China they're pumping these athletes full of steroids, like beef cattle, they're hardly human." Buddy wears steel?rimmed glasses of a style that only lathe operators used to employ, to keep shavings out of their eyes. Buddy does something with electronics and has a mind like that, too precise. He goes on, to bring it home, "Even golf. Palmer and now Nicklaus have been trampled out of sight by these kids nobody has heard of, the colleges down south clone 'em, you can't keep their names straight from one tournament to the next."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry always tries to take an overview. "The records fall because they're there," he says. "Aaron shouldn't have been playing, they kept him in there just so he could break Ruth's record. ?I can remember when a five?minute mile in high school was a miracle. Now girls are doing it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It is amazing," Buddy's girl puts in, this being her conversation, "what the human body can do. Any one of us women here could go out now and pick up a car by the front bumper, if we were motivated. If say there was a child of ours under the tires. You read about incidents like that all the time, and at the hospital where I trained the doctors could lay the statistics of it right out on paper. We don't use half the muscle?power we have."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Webb Murkett kids, "Hear that, Cin? Gas stations all closed down, you can carry the Audi home. Seriously, though. I've always marvelled at these men who know a dozen languages. If the brain is a computer think of all the gray cells this entails. There seems to be lots more room in there, though."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> His young wife silently lifts her hands to twist some water from her hair, that is almost too short to grab. This action gently lifts her tits in their sopping black small slings and reveals the shape of each erect nipple. A white towel is laid across her lap as if to relieve Harry from having to think about her crotch. What turns him off about Buddy's girl, he realizes, is not only does she have pimples on her chin and forehead but on her thighs, high on the inside, like something venereal. Georgene? Geraldine? She is going on in that reedy too?eager voice, "Or the way these yogas can lift themselves off the ground or go back in time for thousands of years. Edgar Cayce has example after example. It's nothing supernatural, I can't believe in God, there's too much suffering, they're just using human powers we all have and never develop. You should all read the Tibetan Book of the Dead."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Really?" Thelma Harrison says dryly. "Who's the author?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Now silence does invade their group. A greenish reflective wobble from the pool washes ghostly and uneasy across their faces and a child gasping as he swims can be heard. Then Webb kindly says, "Closer to home now, we've had a spooky experience lately. I bought one of these Polaroid SX?70 Land Cameras as kind of a novelty, to give the kids a charge, and all of us can't stop being fascinated, it is supernatural, to watch that image develop right under your eyes."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "The kind," Cindy says, "that spits it out at you like this." She makes a cross?eyed face and thrusts out her tongue with a thrrupping noise. All the men laugh, and laugh.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Consumer Reports had something on it," Harry says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's magical," Cindy tells them. "Webb gets really turned on." When she grins her teeth look stubby, the healthy gums come so babyishly low.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why is my glass empty?" Janice asks.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Losers buy," Harry virtually shouts. Such loudness years ago would have been special to male groups but now both sexes have watched enough beer commercials on television to know that this is how to act, jolly and loud, on weekends, in the bar, beside the barbecue grill, on beaches and sundecks and mountainsides. "Winners bought the first round," he calls needlessly, as if among strangers or men without memories, while several arms flail for the waitress.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry's team lost the Nassau, but he feels it was his partner's fault. Buddy is such a flub artist, even when he hits two good shots he skulls the chip and takes three putts to get down. Whereas Harry as he has said hit the ball well, if not always straight: arms like ropes, start down slow, and look at the ball until it seems to swell. He ended with a birdie, on the long par?five that winds in around the brook with its watercress and sandy orange bottom almost to the clubhouse lawn; and that triumph ? the wooden gobbling sound the cup makes when a long putt falls! ? eclipses many double bogeys and suffuses with a limpid certainty of his own omnipotence and immortality the sight of the scintillating chlorinated water, the sunstruck faces and torsos of his companions, and the undulant shadow?pitted flank of Mt. Pemaquid where its forest begins above the shaven bright stripes of the fairways. He feels brother to this mountain in the day's declining sunlight. Mt. Pemaquid has only been recently tamed; for the two centuries while Mt. Judge presided above the metropolitan burgeoning of Brewer, the mountain nearby yet remained if not quite a wilderness a strange and forbidding place, where resort hotels failed and burned down and only hikers and lovers and escaping criminals ventured. The developers of the Flying Eagle (its name plucked from a bird, probably a sparrow hawk, the first surveyor spotted and took as an omen) bought three hundred acres of the lower slopes cheap; as the bulldozers ground the second?growth ash, poplar, hickory, and dogwood into muddy troughs that would become fairways and terraced tennis courts, people said the club would fail, the county already had the Brewer Country Club south of the city for the doctors and the Jews and ten miles north the Tulpehocken Club behind its fieldstone walls and tall wrought?iron fencing for the old mill?owning families and their lawyers and for the peasantry several nine?hole public courses tucked around in the farmland. But there was a class of the young middle?aged that had arisen in the retail businesses and service industries and software end of the new technology and that did not expect liveried barmen and secluded cardrooms, that did not mind the pre?fab clubhouse and sweep?it?yourself tennis courts of the Flying Eagle; to them the polyester wall?to?wall carpeting of the locker rooms seemed a luxury, and a Coke machine in a cement corridor a friendly sight. They were happy to play winter rules all summer long on the immature, patchy fairways and to pay for all their privileges the five hundred, now risen to six?fifty, in annual dues, plus a small fortune in chits. Fred Springer for years had angled for admission to the Brewer C.C. ? the Tulpehocken was as out of reach as the College of Cardinals, he knew that ? and had failed; now his daughter Janice wears whites and signs chits just like the heiresses of Sunflower Beer and Frankhauser Steel. Just like a du Pont. At the Flying Eagle Harry feels exercised, cleansed, cherished; the biggest man at the table, he lifts his hand and a girl in the restaurant uniform of solid green blouse and checked skirt of white and green comes and takes his order for more drinks on this Sunday of widespread gas dearth. She doesn't ask his name; the people here know it. Her own name is stitched Sandra on her blouse pocket; she has milky skin like his daughter but is shorter, and the weary woman she will be is already moving into her face.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Do you believe in astrology?" Buddy's girl abruptly asks Cindy Murkett. Maybe she's a Lesbian, is why Harry can't remember her name. It was a name soft around the edges, not Gertrude.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't know," Cindy says, the widened eyes of her surprise showing very white in her mask of tan. "I look at the horoscope in the papers sometimes. Some of the things they say ring so true, but isn't there a trick to that?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's no trick, it's ancient science. It's the most ancient science there is."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> This assault on Cindy's repose agitates Harry so he turns to Webb and asks if he watched the Phillies game last night.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "The Phillies are dead," Ronnie Harrison butts in.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buddy comes up with the statistic that they've lost twentythree of their last thirty?four games.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I was brought up a Catholic," Cindy is saying to Buddy's girl in a voice so lowered Harry has to strain to hear. "And the priests said such things are the work of the Devil." She fingers as she confides this the small crucifix she wears about her throat on a chain so fine it has left no trace in her tan.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Bowa's being out has hurt them quite a lot," Webb says judiciously, and pokes another cigarette into his creased face, lifting his rubbery upper lip automatically like a camel. He shot an 84 this afternoon, with a number of three?putt greens.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice is asking Thelma where she bought that lovely bathing suit. She must be drunk. "You can't find that kind at all in Kroll's anymore," Rabbit hears her say. Janice is wearing an old sort of Op?pattern blue two?piece, with a white cardigan bought to go with her tennis whites hung capelike over her shoulders. She holds a cigarette in her hand and Webb Murkett leans over to light it with his turquoise propane lighter. She's not so bad, Harry thinks, remembering how he fucked her in her sleep. Or was it, for she seemed to moan and stop snoring afterwards. Compared to Thelma's passive sallow body Janice's figure has energy, edge, the bones of the knees pressing their shape against the skin as she leans forward to accept his light. She does this with a certain accustomed grace. Webb respects her, as Fred Springer's daughter.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry wonders where his own daughter is this afternoon, out in the country. Doing some supper chore, having come back from feeding chickens or whatever. Sundays in the sticks aren't so different, animals don't know about holidays. Would she have gone to church this morning? Ruth had no use for that. He can't picture Ruth in the country at all. For him, she was city, those solid red brick rows of Brewer that take what comes. The drinks come. ?Grateful cries, like on the beer commercials, and Cindy Murkett decides to earn hers by going for another swim. When she stands, the backs of her thighs are printed in squares and her skimpy black bathing suit bottom, still soaked, clings in two thin arcs well below two dimples symmetrically set in her fat like little whirlpools; the sight dizzies Harry. Didn't he used to take Ruth to the public pool in West Brewer? Memorial Day. There was the smell of grass pressed under your damp towel spread out in the shade of the trees away from the tile pool. Now you sit in chairs of enamelled wire that unless you have a cushion print a waffle pattern on the backs of your thighs. The mountain is drawing closer. Sun reddening beyond the city dusts with gold the tips of trees high like a mane on the crest of Pemaquid and deepens the pockets of dark between each tree in the undulating forest that covers like deep?piled carpet the acreage between crest and course. Along the far eleventh fairway men are still picking their way, insect?sized. As his eyes are given to these distances Cindy flat?dives and a few drops of the splash prick Harry's naked chest, that feels broad as the basking mountain. He frames in his mind the words, 1 heard a funny story on the radio yesterday driving home ....
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> . . . if I had your nice legs," Ronnie's plain wife is concluding to Janice.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh but you still have a waist. Creeping middle?itis, that's what I've got. Harry says I'm shaped like a pickle." Giggle. First she giggles, then she begins to lurch.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He looks asleep."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He opens his eyes and announces to the air, "I heard a funny story on the radio yesterday driving home."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Fire Ozark," Ronnie is insisting loudly. "He's lost their re-spect, he's demoralizing. Until they can Ozark and trade Rose away, the Phillies are D, E, A, D, dead."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'm listening," Buddy's awful girlfriend tells Harry, so he has to go on.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh just some doctor down in Baltimore, the radio announ-cer said he was hauled into court for killing a goose on the course with a golf club."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Course on the golf with a goose club," Janice giggles. Some day what would give him great pleasure would be to take a large round rock and crush her skull in with it.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Where'd you hear this, Harry?" Webb Murkett asks him, coming in late but politely tilting his long head, one eye shut against the smoke of his cigarette.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "On the radio yesterday, driving home," Harry answers, sorry he has begun.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Speaking of yesterday," Buddy has to interrupt, "I saw a gas line five blocks long. That Sunoco at the corner of Ash and Fourth, it went down Fourth to Buttonwood, Buttonwood to Fifth, Fifth back to Ash, and then a new line beginning the other side of Ash. They had guys directing and everything. I couldn't believe it, and cars were still getting into it. Five fucking blocks long."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Big heating?oil dealer who's one of our clients," Ronnie says, "says they have plenty of crude, it's just they've decided to put the squeeze on gasoline and make more heating oil out of it. The crude. In their books winter's already here. I asked the guy what was going to happen to the average motorist and he looked at me funny and said, `He can go screw himself instead of driving every weekend to the Jersey Shore."'
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Ronnie, Harry's trying to tell a story," Thelma says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It hardly seems worth it," he says, enjoying now the pro-longed focus on him, the comedy of delay. Sunshine on the mountain. The second gin is percolating through his system and elevating his spirits. He loves this crowd, his crowd, and the crowds at the other tables too, that are free to send delegates over and mingle with theirs, everybody knowing everybody else, and the kids in the pool, that somebody would save even if that caramel?colored lifeguard?girl popping bubble gum weren't on duty, and loves the fact that this is all on credit, the club not tak-ing its bite until the tenth of every month.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Now they coax him. "Come on, Harry, don't be a prick," Buddy's girl says. She's using his name now, he has to find hers. Gretchen. Ginger. Maybe those aren't actually pimples on her thighs, just a rash from chocolate or poison oak. She looks aller-gic, that pushed?in face, like she'd have trouble breathing. Defects come in clumps.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "So this doctor," he concedes, "is hauled into court for killing a goose on the course with a golf club."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What club?" Ronnie asks.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I knew you'd ask that," Harry says. "If not you, some other jerk."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'd think a sand wedge," Buddy says, "right at the throat. It'd clip the head right off."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Too short in the handle, you couldn't get close enough," Ronnie argues. He squints as if to judge a distance. "I'd say a five or even an easy four would be the right stick. Hey Harry, how about that five?iron I put within a gimme on the fifteenth from way out on the other side of the sand trap? In deep rough yet."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You nudged it," Harry says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Heh?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I saw you nudge the ball up to give yourself a lie."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Let's get this straight. You're saying I cheated."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Something like that."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Let's hear the story, Harry," Webb Murkett says, lighting another cigarette to dramatize his patience.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ginger was in the ballpark. Thelma Harrison is staring at him with her big brown sunglasses and that is distracting too. "So the doctor's defense evidently was that he had hit the goose with a golf ball and injured it badly enough he had to put it out of its misery. Then this announcer said, it seemed cute at the time, she was a female announcer -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Wait a minute sweetie, I don't understand," Janice says. "You mean he threw a golf ball at this goose?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh my God," Rabbit says, "am I ever sorry I got started on this. Let's go home."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No tell me," Janice says, looking panicked.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He didn't throw the ball, the goose was on the fairway probably by some pond and the guy's drive or whatever it was -'
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Could have been his second shot and he shanked it," Buddy offers.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> His nameless girlfriend looks around and in that fake little?girl voice asks, "Are geese allowed on golf courses? I mean, that may be stupid, Buddy's the first golfer I've gone out with -'
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You call that a golfer?" Ronnie interrupts.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buddy tells them, "I've read somewhere about a course in Alaska where these caribou wander. Maybe it's Sweden."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I've heard of moose on courses in Maine," Webb Murkett says. Lowering sun flames in his twisted eyebrows. He seems sad. Maybe he's feeling the liquor too, for he rambles on, "Wonder why you never hear of a Swedish golfer. You hear of Bjorn Borg, and this skier Stenmark."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit decides to ride it through. "So the announcer says, `A mercy killing, or murder most foul?"'
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Ouch," someone says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ronnie is pretending to ruminate, "Maybe you'd be better off with a four?wood, and play the goose off your left foot."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nobody heard the punch line," Harry protests.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I heard it," Thelma Harrison says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "We all heard it," Buddy says. "It's just very distressing to me," he goes on, and looks very severe in his steel?rimmed glasses, so the women at first take him seriously, "that nobody here, I mean nobody, has shown any sympathy for the goose."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Somebody sympathized enough to bring the man to court," Webb Murkett points out.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I discover myself," Buddy complains sternly, "in the midst of a crowd of people who while pretending to be liberal and tolerant are really anti?goose."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Who, me?" Ronnie says, making his voice high as if goosed. Rabbit hates this kind of humor, but the others seem to enjoy it, including the women.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Cindy has returned glistening from her swim. Standing there with her bathing suit slightly awry, she tugs it straight and blushes in the face of their laughter. "Are you talking about me?" The little cross glints beneath the hollow of her throat. Her feet look pale on the poolside flagstones. Funny, how pale the tops of feet stay.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Webb gives his wife's wide hips a sideways hug. "No, honey. Harry was telling us a shaggy goose story."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Tell me, Harry."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not now. Nobody liked it. Webb will tell you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Sandra in her green and white uniform comes up to them. "Mrs. Angstrom."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The words shock Harry, as if his mother has been resurrected.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yes," Janice answers matter?of?factly.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Your mother is on the phone."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh Lordie, what now?" Janice stands, lurches slightly, composes herself. She takes her beach towel from the back of her chair and wraps it around her hips rather than walk in merely a bathing suit past dozens of people into the clubhouse. "What do you think it is?" she asks Harry.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He shrugs. "Maybe she wants to know what kind of baloney we're having tonight."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> A dig in that, delivered openly. The awful girlfriend titters. Harry is ashamed of himself, thinking in contrast of Webb's sideways hug of Cindy's hips. This kind of crowd will do a marriage in if you let it. He doesn't want to get sloppy.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> In defiance Janice asks, "Honey, could you order me another vod?and?ton while I'm gone?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No." He softens this to, "I'll think about it," but the chill has been put on the party.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The Murketts consult and conclude it may be time to go, they have a thirteen?year?old babysitter, a neighbor's child. The same sunlight that ignited Webb's eyebrows lights the halo of fine hairs standing up from the goosebumps on Cindy's thighs. Not bothering with any towel around her, she saunters to the ladies' locker room to change, her pale feet leaving wet prints on the gray flagstones. Wait, wait, the Sunday, the weekend cannot be by, a golden sip remains in the glass. On the transparent tabletop among the wire chairs drinks have left a ghostly clockwork of rings refracted into visibility by the declining light. What can Janice's mother want? She has called out to them from a darker older world he remembers but wants to stay buried, a world of constant clothing and airless front parlors, of coal bins and narrow houses with spite-fully drawn shades, where the farmer's drudgery and the mill-worker's ruled land and city. Here, clean children shivering with their sudden emergence into the thinner element are handed towels by their mothers. Cindy's towel hangs on her empty chair. To be Cindy's towel and to be sat upon by her: the thought dries Rabbit's mouth. To stick your tongue in just as far as it would go while her pussy tickles your nose. No acne in that crotch. Heaven. He looks up and sees the shaggy mountain shouldering into the sun still, though the chairs are making long shadows, lozenge checker-boards. Buddy Inglefmger is saying to Webb Murkett in a low voice whose vehemence is not ironical, "Ask yourself sometime who benefits from inflation. The people in debt benefit, society's losers. The government benefits because it collects more in taxes without raising the rates. Who doesn't benefit? The man with money in his pocket, the man who's paid his bills. That's why" ? Buddy's voice drops to a conspiratorial hiss ? "that man is vanishing like the red Indian. Why should I work," he asks Webb, "when the money is taken right out of my pocket for the benefit of those who don't?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry is thinking his way along the mountain ridge, where clouds are lifting like a form of steam. As if in driven motion Mt. Pemaquid cleaves the summer sky and sun, though poolside is in shadow now. Thelma is saying cheerfully to the girlfriend, "Astrology, paten?reading, psychiatry ? I'm for all of it. Anything that helps get you through." Harry is thinking of his own parents. They should have belonged to a club. Living embattled, Mom feuding with the neighbors, Pop and his union hating the men who owned the printing plant where he worked his life away, both of them scorning the few kin that tried to keep in touch, the four of them, Pop and Mom and Hassy and Mim, against the world and a certain guilt attaching to any reaching up and outside for a friend. Don't trust anybody: Andy Mellon doesn't, and 1 don't. Dear Pop. He never got out from under. Rabbit basks above that old remembered world, rich, at rest.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Buddy's voice nags on, aggrieved. "Money that goes out of one pocket goes into somebody else's, it doesn't just evaporate. The big boys are getting rich out of this."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> A chair scrapes and Rabbit feels Webb stand. His voice comes from a height, gravelly, humorously placating. "Become a big boy yourself I guess is the only answer."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh sure," Buddy says, knowing he is being put off.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> A tiny speck, a bird, the fabled eagle it might be, no, from the motionlessness of its wings a buzzard, is flirting in flight with the ragged golden?green edge of the mountain, now above it like a speck on a Kodak slide, now below it out of sight, while a blue-bellied cloud unscrolls, endlessly, powerfully. Another chair is scraped on the flagstones. His name, "Harry," is sharply called, in Janice's voice.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He lowers his gaze at last out of glory and as his eyes adjust his forehead momentarily hurts, a small arterial pain; perhaps with such a negligible unexplained ache do men begin their deaths, some slow as being tumbled by a cat and some fast as being struck by a hawk. Cancer, coronary. "What did Bessie want?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice's tone is breathless, faintly stricken. "She says Nelson's come. With this girl."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Melanie," Harry says, pleased to have remembered. And his remembering brings along with it Buddy's girlfriend's name. Joanne. "It was nice to have met you, Joanne," he says in parting, shaking her hand. Making a good impression. Casting his shadow.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> As Harry drives them home in Janice's Mustang convertible with the top down, air pours over them and lends an illusion of urgent and dangerous speed. Their words are snatched from their mouths. "What the fuck are we going to do with the kid?" he asks her.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How do you mean?" With her dark hair being blown back, Janice looks like a different person. Eyes asquint against the rush of wind and her upper lip lifted, a hand held near her ear to keep her rippling silk head scarf from flying away. Liz Taylor in A Place in the Sun. Even the little crow's?feet at the corner of her eye look glamorous. She is wearing her tennis dress and the white cashmere cardigan.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I mean is he going to get a job or what?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well Harry. He's still in college."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He doesn't act like it." He feels he has to shout. "I wasn't so fucking fortunate as to get to college and the guys that did didn't goof off in Colorado hang gliding and God knows what until their father's money ran out."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You don't know what they did. Anyway times are different. Now you be nice to Nelson. After the things you put him through -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not just me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "? after what he went through you should be grateful he wants to come home. Ever."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't know."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You don't know what?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "This doesn't feel good to me. I've been too happy lately."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't be irrational," Janice says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She is not, this implies. But one of their bonds has always been that her confusion keeps pace with his. As the wind pours past he feels a scared swift love for something that has no name. Her? His life? The world? Coming from the Mt. Pemaquid direction, you see the hillside borough of Mt. Judge from a spread?out angle altogether different from what you see coming home from the Brewer direction: the old box factory a long lean?windowed slab down low by the dried?up falls, sent underground to make electricity, and the new supertall Exxon and Mobil signs on their tapered aluminum poles along Route 422 as eerie as antennae arrived out of space. The town's stacked windows burn orange in the sun that streams level up the valley, and from this angle great prominence gathers to the sandstone spire of the Lutheran church where Rabbit went to Sunday school under crusty old Fritz Kruppenbach, who pounded in the lesson that life has no terrors for those with faith but for those without faith there can be no salvation and no peace. No peace. A sign says THICKLY SETTLED. As the Mustang slows, Harry is moved to confess to Janice, "I started to tell you last night, this young couple came into the lot yesterday and the girl reminded me of Ruth. She would be about the right age too. Slimmer, and not much like her in her way of talking, but there was, I don't know, something."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Your imagination is what it was. Did you get the girl's name?" "I asked, but she wouldn't give it. She was cute about it, too. Kind of flirty, without anything you could put your finger on."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And you think that girl was your daughter."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> From her tone he knows he shouldn't have confessed. "I didn't say that exactly."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Then what did you say? You're telling me you're still thinking of this bag you fucked twenty years ago and now you and she have a darling little baby." He glances over and Janice no longer suggests Elizabeth Taylor, her lips all hard and crinkled as if baked in her fury. Ida Lupino. Where did they go, all the great Hollywood bitches? In town for years there had been just a Stop sign at the corner where Jackson slants down into Central but the other year after the burgess's own son smashed up a car running the sign the borough put in a light, that is mostly on blink, yellow this way and red the other. He touches the brake and takes the left turn. Janice leans with the turn to keep her mouth close to his ear. "You are crazy," she shouts. "You always want what you don't have instead of what you do. Getting all cute and smiley in the face thinking about this girl that doesn't exist while your real son, that you had with your wife, is waiting at home right now and you saying you wished he'd stay in Colorado."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I do wish that," Harry says ? anything to change the subject even slightly. "You're wrong about my wanting what I don't have. I pretty much like what I have. The trouble with that is, then you get afraid somebody will take it from you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well it's not going to be Nelson, he wants nothing from you except a little love and he doesn't get that. I don't know why you're such an unnatural father."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> So they can finish their argument before they reach Ma Springer's he has slowed their speed up Jackson, under the shady interlock of maples and horsechestnuts, that makes the hour feel later than it is. "The kid has it in for me," he says mildly, to see what this will bring on.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> It re?excites her. "You keep saying that but it's not true. He loves you. Or did." Where the sky shows through the mingled tree tops there is still a difference of light, a flickering that beats upon their faces and hands mothlike. In a sullen semi?mollified tone she says, "One thing definite, I don't want to hear any more about your darling illegitimate daughter. It's a disgusting idea."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I know. I don't know why I mentioned it." He had mistaken the two of them for one and entrusted to her this ghost of his alone. A mistake married people make.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Disgusting!" Janice cries.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'll never mention it again," he promises.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> They ease into Joseph, at the corner where the fire hydrant still wears, faded, the red?white?and?blue clown outfit that schoolchildren three Junes ago painted on for the Bicentennial. Polite in his freshened dislike of her, he asks, "Shall I put the car in the garage?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Leave it out front, Nelson may want it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> As they walk up the front steps his feet feel heavy, as if the world has taken on new gravity. He and the kid years ago went through something for which Rabbit has forgiven himself but which he knows the kid never has. A girl called Jill died when Harry's house burned down, a girl Nelson had come to love like a sister. At least like a sister. But the years have piled on, the surviving have patched things up, and so many more have joined the dead, undone by diseases for which only God is to blame, that it no longer seems so bad, it seems more as if Jill just moved to another town, where the population is growing. Jill would be twenty?eight now. Nelson is twenty?two. Think of all the blame God has to shoulder.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ma's front door sticks and yields with a shove. The living room is dark and duffel bags have been added to its clutter of padded furniture. A shabby plaid suitcase, not Nelson's, sits on the stair landing. The voices come from the sunporch. These voices lessen Harry's gravity, seem to refute the world's rumors of universal death. He moves toward the voices, through the dining room and then the kitchen, into the porch area conscious of himself as slightly too drunk to be cautious enough, overweight and soft and a broad target.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Copper?beech leaves crowd at the porch screen. Faces and bodies rise from the aluminum and nylon furniture like the cloud of an explosion with the sound turned down on TV. More and more in middle age the world comes upon him like images on a set with one thing wrong with it, like those images the mind entertains before we go to sleep, that make sense until we look at them closely, which wakes us up with a shock. It is the girl who has risen most promptly, a curly?headed rather sturdy girl with shining brown eyes halfway out of her head and a ruby?red dimpling smile lifted from a turn?of?the?century valentine. She has on jeans that have been through everything and a Hindu sort of embroidered shirt that has lost some sequins. Her handshake surprises him by being damp, nervous.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson slouches to his feet. His usual troubled expression wears a mountaineer's tan, and he seems thinner, broader in the shoulders. Less of a puppy, more of a mean dog. At some point in Colorado or at Kent he has had his hair, which in high school used to fall to his shoulders, cut short, to give a punk look. "Dad, this is my friend Melanie. My father. And my mother. Mom, this is Melanie."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Pleased to meet you both," the girl says, keeping the merry red smile as if even these plain words are prelude to a joke, to a little circus act. That is what she reminds Harry of, those somehow unreal but visibly brave women who hang by their teeth in circuses, or ride one?footed the velvet rope up to fly through the spangled air, though she is dressed in that raggy look girls hide in now. A strange wall or glare has instantly fallen between himself and this girl, a disinterest that he takes to be a gesture toward his son.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson and Janice are embracing. Those little Springer hands, Harry remembers his mother saying, as he sees them press into the back of Janice's tennis dress. Tricky little paws, something about the curve of the stubby curved fingers that hints of sneaky strength. No visible moons to the fingernails and the ends look nibbled. A habit of sullen grievance and blank stubbornness has descended to Nelson from Janice. The poor in spirit.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Yet when Janice steps aside to greet Melanie, and father and son are face to face, and Nelson says, "Hey, Dad," and like his father Harry wonders whether to shake hands or hug or touch in any way, love floods clumsily the hesitant space.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You look fit," Harry says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I feel beat."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How'd you get here so soon?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hitched, except for a stretch after Kansas City where we took a bus as far as Indianapolis." Places where Rabbit has never been, restless though his blood is. The boy tells him, "The night before last we spent in some field in western Ohio, I don't know, after Toledo. It was weird. We'd gotten stoned with the guy who picked us up in this van all painted with designs, and when he dumped us off Melanie and I were really disoriented, we had to keep talking to each other so we wouldn't panic. The ground was colder than you'd think, too. We woke up frozen but at least the trees had stopped looking like octopuses."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nelson," Janice cries, "something dreadful could have happened to you! To the two of you."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Who cares?" the boy asks. To his grandmother, Bessie sitting in her private cloud in the darkest corner of the porch, he says, "You wouldn't care, would you Mom?mom, if I dropped out of the picture?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Indeed I would," is her stout response. "You were the apple of your granddad's eye."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Melanie reassures Janice, "People are basically very nice." Her voice is strange, gurgling as if she has just recovered from a fit of laughter, with a suspended singing undertone. Her mind seems focused on some faraway cause for joy. "You only meet the difficult ones now and then, and they're usually all right as long as you don't show fear."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What does your mother think of your hitchhiking?" Janice asks her.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She hates it," Melanie says, and laughs outright, her curls shaking. "But she lives in California." She turns serious, her eyes shining on Janice steadily as lamps. "Really though, it's ecologically sound, it saves all that gas. More people should do it, but everybody's afraid."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> A gorgeous frog, is what she looks like to Harry, though her body from what you can tell in those flopsy?mopsy clothes is human enough, and even exemplary. He tells Nelson, "If you'd budgeted your allowance better you'd've been able to take the bus all the way."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Buses are boring, Dad, and full of creeps. You don't learn anything on a bus."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's true," Melanie chimes in. "I've heard terrible stories from girlfriends of mine, that happened to them on buses. The drivers can't do anything, they just drive, and ifyou look at all, you know, what they think of as hippie, they egg the guys on it seems."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "The world is no longer a safe place," Ma Springer announces from her dark corner.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry decides to act the father. "I'm glad you made it," he tells Nelson. "I'm proud of you, getting around the way you do. If I'd seen a little more of the United States when I was your age, I'd be a better citizen now. The only free ride I ever got was when Uncle sent me to Texas. Lubbock, Texas. They'd let us out," he tells Melanie, "Saturday nights, in the middle of a tremendous cow pasture. Fort Larson, it was called." He is overacting, talking too much.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Dad," Nelson says impatiently, "the country's the same now wherever you go. The same supermarkets, the same plastic shit for sale. There's nothing to see."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Colorado was a disappointment to Nelson," Melanie tells them, with her merry undertone.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I liked the state, I just didn't care for the skunks who live in it." That aggrieved stunted look on his face. Harry knows he will never find out what happened in Colorado, to drive the kid back to him. Like those stories kids bring back from school where it was never them who started the fight.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Have these children had any supper?" Janice asks, working up her mother act. You get out of practice quickly.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ma Springer with unexpected complacence announces, "Melanie made the most delicious salad out of what she could find in the refrigerator and outside."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I love your garden," Melanie tells Harry. "The little gate. Things grow so beautifully around here." He can't get over the way she warbles everything, all the while staring at his face as if fearful he will miss some point.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah," he says. "It's depressing, in a way. Was there any baloney left?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson says, "Melanie's veggy, Dad."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Vega?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Vegetarian," the boy explains in his put?on whine.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh. Well, no law against that."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The boy yawns. "Maybe we should hit the hay. Melanie and I got about an hour's sleep last night."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice and Harry go tense, and eye Melanie and Ma Springer.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice says, "I better make up Nellie's bed."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I've already done it," her mother tells her. "And the bed in the old sewing room too. I've had a lot of time by myself today, it seems you two are at the club more and more."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How was church?" Harry asks her.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ma Springer says unwillingly, "It was not very inspiring. For the collection music they had brought out from St. Mary's in Brewer one of those men who can sing in a high voice like a woman."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Melanie smiles. "A countertenor. My brother was once a countertenor."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Then what happened?" Harry asks, yawning himself. He suggests, "His voice changed."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Her eyes are solemn. "Oh no. He took up polo playing."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He sounds like a real sport."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He's really my half?brother. My father was married before."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson tells Harry, "Mom?mom and I ate what was left of the baloney, Dad. We ain't no veggies."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry asks Janice, "What's there left for me? Night after night, I starve around here."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice waves away his complaint with a queenly gesture she wouldn't have possessed ten years ago. "I don't know, I was thinking we'd get a bite at the club, then Mother called."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'm not sleepy," Melanie tells Nelson.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Maybe she ought to see a little ofthe area," Harry offers. "And you could pick up a pizza while you're out."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "In the West," Nelson says, "they hardly have pizzas, everything is this awful Mexican crap, tacos and chili. Yuk."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'll phone up Giordano's, remember where that is? A block beyond the courthouse, on Seventh?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Dad, I've lived my whole life in this lousy county."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You and me both. How does everybody feel about pepperoni? Let's get a couple, I bet Melanie's still hungry. One pepperoni and one combination."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Jesus, Dad. We keep telling you, Melanie's a vegetarian."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oops. I'll order one plain. You don't have any bad feelings about cheese, do you Melanie? Or mushrooms. How about with mushrooms?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'm full," the girl beams, her voice slowed it seems by its very burden of delight. "But I'd love to go with Nelson for the ride, I really like this area. It's so lush, and the houses are all kept so neat."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice takes this opening, touching the girl's arm, another gesture she might not have dared in the past. "Have you seen the upstairs?" she asks. "What we normally use for a guest room is across the hall from Mother's room, you'd share a bathroom with her."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, I didn't expect a room at all. I had thought just a sleeping bag on the sofa. Wasn't there a nice big sofa in the room where we first came in?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry assures her, "You don't want to sleep on that sofa, it's so full of dust you'll sneeze to death. The room upstairs is nice, honest; if you don't mind sharing with a dressmaker's dummy."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh no," the girl responds. "I really just want a tiny corner where I won't be in the way, I want to go out and get a job as a waitress."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The old lady fidgets, moving her coffee cup from her lap to the folding tray table beside her chair. "I made all my dresses for years but once I had to go to the bifocals I couldn't even sew Fred's buttons on," she says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "By that time you were rich anyway," Harry tells her, jocular in his relief at the bed business seeming to work out so smoothly. Old lady Springer, when you cross her there's no end to it, she never forgets. Harry was a little hard on Janice early in the marriage and you can still see resentment in the set of Bessie's mouth. He dodges out of the sunporch to the phone in the kitchen. While
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Giordano's is ringing, Nelson comes up behind him and rummages in his pockets. "Hey," Harry says, "what're ya robbing me for?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Car keys. Mom says take the car out front."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry braces the receiver between his shoulder and ear and fishes the keys from his left pocket and, handing them over, for the first time looks Nelson squarely in the face. He sees nothing of himself there except the small straight nose and a cowlick in one eyebrow that sends a little fan of hairs the wrong way and seems to express a doubt. Amazing, genes. So precise in all that coiled coding they can pick up a tiny cowlick like that. That girl had had Ruth's tilt, exactly: a little forward push of the upper lip and thighs, soft?tough, comforting.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Thanks, Pops."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't dawdle. Nothing worse than cold pizza."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What was that?" a tough voice at the other end of the line asks, having at last picked up the phone.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nothing, sorry," Harry says, and orders three pizzas ? one pepperoni, one combination, and one plain in case Melanie changes her mind. He gives Nelson a ten?dollar bill. "We ought to talk sometime, Nellie, when you get some rest." The remark goes with the money, somehow. Nelson makes no answer, taking the bill.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> When the young people are gone, Harry returns to the sunporch and says to the women, "Now that wasn't so bad, was it? She seemed happy to sleep in the sewing room."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Seems isn't being," Ma Springer darkly says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Hey that's right," Harry says. "Whaddid you think ofher anyway? The girlfriend."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Does she feel like a girlfriend to you?" Janice asks him. She has at last sat down, and has a small glass in her hand. The liquid in the glass he can't identify by its color, a sickly but intense red like old?fashioned cream soda or the fluid in thermometers.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Whaddeya mean? They spent last night in a field together. God knows how they shacked up in Colorado. Maybe in a cave."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'm not sure that follows anymore. They try to be friends in a way we couldn't when we were young. Boys and girls."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nelson does not look contented," Ma Springer announces heavily.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "When did he ever?" Harry asks.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "As a little boy he seemed very hopeful," his grandmother says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Bessie, what's your analysis of what brought him back here?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The old lady sighs. "Some disappointment. Some thing that got too big for him. I'll tell you this though. If that girl doesn't behave herself under our roof, I'm moving out. I talked to Grace Stuhl about it after church and she's more than willing, poor soul, to have me move in. She thinks it might prolong her life."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Mother," Janice asks, "aren't you missing All in the Family?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It was to be a show I've seen before, the one where this old girlfriend of Archie's comes back to ask for money. Now that it's summer it's all reruns. I did hope to look at The Jeffersons though, at nine?thirty, before this hour on Moses, if I can stay awake. Maybe I'll go upstairs to rest my legs. When I was making up Nellie's little bed, a corner hit a vein and it won't stop throbbing." She stands, wincing.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Mother," Janice says impatiently, "I would have made up those beds if you'd just waited. Let me go up with you and look at the guest room."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry follows them out of the sunporch (it's getting too tragic in there, the copper beech black as ink, captive moths beating their wings to a frazzle on the screens) and into the dining room. He likes the upward glimpse of Janice's legs in the tennis dress as she goes upstairs to help her mother make things fit and proper. Ought to try fucking her some night when they're both awake. He could go upstairs and give her a hand now but he is attracted instead to the exotic white face of the woman on the cover of the July Consumer Reports, that he brought downstairs this morning to read in the pleasant hour between when Ma went off to church and he and Janice went off to the club. The magazine still rests on the arm of the Barcalounger, that used to be old man Springer's evening throne. You couldn't dislodge him, and when he went off to the bathroom or into the kitchen for his Diet Pepsi the chair stayed empty. Harry settles into it. The girl on the cover is wearing a white bowler hat on her white?painted face above the lapels of a fully white tuxedo; she is made up in red, white, and blue like a clown and in her uplifted hand has a dab of gooey white face cleaner. Jism, models are prostitutes, the girls in blue movies rub their faces in jism. Broadway tests, face cleansers it says beneath her, for face cleansers are one of the commodities this month's issue is testing, along with cottage cheese (how unclean is it? it is rather unclean), air?conditioners, compact stereos, and can openers (why do people make rectangular cans anyway?). He turns to finish with the air?conditioners and reads that if you live in a high?humidity area (and he supposes he does, at least compared to Arizona) almost all models tend to drip, some enough to make them doubtful choices for installation over a patio or walkway. It would be nice to have a patio, along with a sunken living room like Webb Murkett does. Webb and that cute little cunt Cindy, always looking hosed down. Still, Rabbit is content. This is what he ikes, domestic peace. Women circling with dutiful footsteps above him and the summer night like a lake lapping at the windows. He has time to read about compact stereos and even try the piece on car loans before Nelson and Melanie come back out of this night with three stained boxes of pizza. Quickly Harry snatches off his reading glasses, for he feels strangely naked in them.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The boy's face has brightened and might even be called cheerful. "Boy," he tells his father, "Mom's Mustang really can dig when you ask it to. Some jungle bunny in about a '69 Caddy kept racing his motor and I left him standing. Then he tailgated me all the way to the Running Horse Bridge. It was scary."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You came around that way? Jesus, no wonder it took so long."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nelson was showing me the city," Melanie explains, with her musical smile, that leaves the trace of a hum in the air as she moves with the flat cardboard boxes toward the kitchen. Already she has that nice upright walk of a waitress.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He calls after her, "It's a city that's seen better days."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I think it's beauti?ful," her answer floats back. "The people paint their houses in these different colors, like something you'd see in the Mediterranean."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "The spics do that," Harry says. "The spics and the wops."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Dad, you're really prejudiced. You should travel more."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Naa, it's all in fun. I love everybody, especially with my car windows locked." He adds, "Toyota was going to pay for me and your mother to go to Atlanta, but then some agency toward Harrisburg beat our sales total and they got the trip instead. It was a regional thing. It bothered me because I've always been curious about the South: love hot weather."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't be so chintzy, Dad. Go for your vacation and pay your way."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Vacations, we're pretty well stuck with that camp up in the Poconos." Old man Springer's pride and joy.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I took this course in sociology at Kent. The reason you're so tight with your money, you got the habit of poverty when you were a child, in the Depression. You were traumatized."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "We weren't that bad off. Pop got decent money, printers were never laid off like some of the professions. Anyway who says I'm tight with my money?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You owe Melanie three dollars already. I had to borrow from her."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You mean those three pizzas cost thirteen dollars?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "We got a couple of sixpacks to go with them."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You and Melanie can pay for your own beer. We never drink it around here. Too fattening."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Where's Mom?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Upstairs. And another thing. Don't leave your mother's car out front with the top down. Even if it doesn't rain, the maples drop something sticky on the seats."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I thought we might go out again."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You're kidding. I thought you said you got only an hour's sleep last night."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Dad, lay off the crap. I'm going on twenty?three."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Twenty?three, and no sense. Give me the keys. I'll put the Mustang out back in the garage."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Mo?om," the boy shouts upwards. "Dad won't let me drive your car!"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice is coming down. She has put on her peppermint dress and looks tired. Harry tells her, "All I asked was for him to put it in the garage. The maple sap gets the seats sticky. He says he wants to go out again. Christ, it's nearly ten o'clock."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "The maples are through dripping for the year," Janice says. To Nelson she merely says, "If you don't want to go out again maybe you should put the top up. We had a terrible thunderstorm two nights ago. It hailed, even."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why do you think," Rabbit asks her, "your top is all black and spotty? The sap or whatever it is drips down on the canvas and can't be cleaned off"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Harry, it's not your car," Janice tells him.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Piz?za," Melanie calls from the kitchen, her tone bright and pearly. "Mangiamo, prego!"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Dad's really into cars, isn't he?" Nelson asks his mother. "Like they're magical, now that he sells them."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry asks her, "How about Ma? She want to eat again?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Mother says she feels sick."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh great. One of her spells."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Today was an exciting day for her."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Today was an exciting day for me too. I was told I'm a tightwad and think cars are magical." This is no way to be, spiteful. "Also, Nelson, I birdied the eighteenth, you know that long dogleg? A drive that just cleared the creek and kept bending right, and then I hit an easy five?iron and then wedged it up to about twelve feet and sank the damn putt! Still have your clubs? We ought to play." He puts a paternal hand on the boy's back.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I sold them to a guy at Kent." Nelson takes an extra?fast step, to get out from under his father's touch. "I think it's the stupidest game ever invented."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You must tell us about hang gliding," his mother says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's neat. It's very quiet. You're in the wind and don't feel a thing. Some of the people get stoned beforehand but then there's the danger you'll think you can really fly."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Melanie has sweetly set out plates and transferred the pizzas from their boxes to cookie sheets. Janice asks, "Melanie, do you hang glide?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh no," says the girl. "I'd be terrified." Her giggling does not somehow interrupt her lustrous, caramel?colored stare. "Pru used to do it with Nelson. I never would."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Who's Pru?" Harry asks.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You don't know her," Nelson tells him.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I know I don't. I know I don't know her. If I knew her I wouldn't have to ask."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I think we're all cross and irritable," Janice says, lifting a piece of pepperoni loose and laying it on a plate.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson assumes that plate is for him. "Tell Dad to quit leaning on me," he complains, settling to the table as if he has tumbled from a motorcycle and is sore all over.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> In bed, Harry asks Janice, "What's eating the kid, do you think?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't know."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Something is." ? "Yes."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> As they think this over they can hear Ma Springer's television going, chewing away at Moses from the Biblical sound of the voices, shouting, rumbling, with crescendos of music between. The old lady falls asleep with it on and sometimes it crackles all night, if janice doesn't tiptoe in and turn it off. Melanie had gone to bed in her room with the dressmaker's dummy. Nelson came upstairs to watch The Jeffersons with his grandmother and by the time his parents came upstairs had gone to bed in his old room, without saying goodnight. Sore all over. Rabbit wonders if the young couple from the country will come into the lot tomorrow. The girl's pale round face and the television screen floating unwatched in Ma Springer's room become confused in his mind as the exalted music soars. Janice is asking, "How do you like the girl?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Melanie baby. Spooky. Are they all that way, of that generation, like a rock just fell on their heads and it was the nicest experience in the world?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I think she's trying to ingratiate herself. It must be a difficult thing, to go into a boyfriend's home and make a place for yourself. I wouldn't have lasted ten minutes with your mother."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Little she knows, the poison Mom talked about her. "Mom was like me," Harry says. "She didn't like being crowded." New people at either end of the house and old man Springer's ghost sittirig downstairs on his Barcalounger. "They don't act very lovey," he says. "Or is that how people are now? Hands off."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I think they don't want to shock us. They know they must get around Mother."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Join the crowd."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice ponders this. The bed creaks and heavy footsteps slither on the other side of the wall, and the excited cries of the television set are silenced with a click. Burt Lancaster just getting warmed up. Those teeth: can they be his own? All the stars have them crowned. Even Harry, he used to have a lot of trouble with his molars and now they're snug, safe and painless, in little jackets of gold alloy costing four hundred fifty each.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She's still up," Janice says. "She won't sleep. She's stewing." In the positive way she pronounces her s's she sounds more and more like her mother. We carry our heredity concealed for a while and then it pushes through. Out of those narrow DNA coils.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> In a stir of wind as before a sudden rain the shadows of the copper?beech leaves surge and fling their ragged interstices of streetlight back and forth across the surfaces where the ceiling meets the far wall. Three cars pass, one after the other, and Harry's sense of the active world outside sliding by as he lies here safe wells up within him to merge with the bed's nebulous ease. He is in his bed, his molars are in their crowns. "She's a pretty good old sport," he says. "She rolls with the punches."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "She's waiting and watching," Janice says in an ominous voice that shows she is more awake than he. She asks, "When do I get my turn?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Turn?" The bed is gently turning, Stavros is waiting for him by the great display window that brims with dusty morning light. You asked for it.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You came last night, from the state I was in this morning. Me and the sheet."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The wind stirs again. Damn. The convertible is still out there with the top down. "Honey, it's been a long day." Running out of gas. "Sorry."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You're forgiven," Janice says. "Just." She has to add, "I might think I don't turn you on much anymore."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No, actually, over at the club today I was thinking how much sassier you look than most of those broads, old Thelma in her little skirt and the awful girlfriend of Buddy's."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And Cindy?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not my type. Too pudgy."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Liar."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> You got it. He is dead tired yet something holds him from the black surface of sleep, and in that half?state just before or after he sinks he imagines he hears lighter, younger footsteps slither outside in the hall, going somewhere in a hurry.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Melanie is as good as her word, she gets a job waitressing at a new restaurant downtown right on Weiser Street, an old restaurant with a new name, The Crepe House. Before that it was the Café Barcelona, painted tiles and paella, iron grillwork and gazpacho; Harry ate lunch there once in a while but in the evening it had attracted the wrong element, hippies and Hispanic families from the south side instead of the white?collar types from West Brewer and the heights along Locust Boulevard, that you need to make a restaurant go in this city. Brewer never has been much for Latin touches, not since Carmen Miranda and all those Walt Disney Saludos Amigos movies. Rabbit remembers there used to be a Club Castanet over on Warren Avenue but the only thing Spanish had been the name and the frills on the waitresses' uniforms, which had been orange. Before the Crepe House had been the Barcelona it had been for many years Johnny Frye's Chophouse, good solid food day and night for the big old?fashioned German eaters, who have eaten themselves pretty well into the grave by now, taking with them tons of pork chops and sauerkraut and a river of Sunflower Beer. Under its newest name, Johnny Frye's is a success; the lean new race of downtown office workers comes out of the banks and the federal offices and the deserted department stores and makes its way at noon through the woods the city planners have inflicted on Weiser Square and sits at the little tile tables left over from the Café Barcelona and dabbles at glorified pancakes wrapped around minced whatever. Even driving through after a movie at one of the malls you can see them in there by candlelight, two by two, bending toward each other over the crepes earnest as hell, on the make, the guys in leisure suits with flared open collars and the girls in slinky dresses that cling to their bodies as if by static electricity, and a dozen more just like them standing in the foyer waiting to be seated. It has to do with diet, Harry figures ? people now want to feel they're eating less, and a crepe sounds like hardly a snack whereas if they called it a pancake they would have scared everybody away but kids and two?ton Katrinkas. Harry marvels that this new tribe of customers exists, on the make, and with money. The world keeps ending but new people too dumb to know it keep showing up as if the fun's just started. The Crepe House is such a hit they've bought the decrepit brick building next door and expanded into the storerooms, leaving the old cigar store, that still has a little gas pilot to light up by by the cash register, intact and doing business. To staff their new space the Crepe House needed more waitresses. Melanie works some days the lunch shift from ten to six and other days she goes from five to near one in the morning. One day Harry took Charlie over to lunch for him to see this new woman in the Angstrom life, but it didn't work out very well: having Nelson's father show up as a customer with a strange man put roses of embarrassment in Melanie's cheeks as she served them in the midst of the lunchtime mob.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not a bad looker," Charlie said on that awkward occasion, gazing after the young woman as she flounced away. The Crepe House dresses its waitresses in a kind of purple colonial mini, with a big bow in back that switches as they walk.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You can see that?" Harry said. "I can't. It bothers me, actually. That I'm not turned on. The kid's been living with us two weeks now and I should be climbing the walls."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "A little old for wall?climbing, aren't you, chief? Anyway there are some women that don't do it for some men. That's why they turn out so many models."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "As you say she has all the equipment. Big knockers, ifyou look."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I looked."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "The funny thing is, she doesn't seem to turn Nelson on either, that I can see. They're buddies all right; when she's home they spend hours in his room together playing his old records and talking about God knows what, sometimes they come out of there it looks like he's been crying, but as far as Jan and I can tell she sleeps in the front room, where we put her as a sop to old lady Springer that first night, never thinking it would stick. Actually Bessie's kind of taken with her by now, she helps with the housework more than Janice does for one thing; so at this point wherever Melanie sleeps I think she'd look the other way."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "They've got to be fucking," Stavros insisted, setting his hands on the table in that defining, faintly menacing way he has: palms facing, thumbs up.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You'd think so," Rabbit agreed. "But these kids now are spooky. These letters in long white envelopes keep arriving from Colorado and they spend a lot of time answering. The postmark's Colorado but the return address printed on is some dean's office at Kent. Maybe he's flunked out."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Charlie scarcely listened. "Maybe I should give her a buzz, if Nelson's not ringing her bell."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Come on, Charlie. I didn't say he's not, I just don't get that vibe around the house. I don't think they do it in the back of the Mustang, the seats are vinyl and these kids today are too spoiled." He sipped his Margarita and wiped the salt from his lips. The bartender here was left over from the Barcelona days, they must have a cellarful of tequila. "To tell you the truth I can't imagine Nelson screwing anybody, he's such a sourpussed little punk."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Got his grandfather's frame. Fred was sexy, don't kid yourself. Couldn't keep his hands off the clerical help, that's why so many of them left. Where'd you say she's from?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "California. Her father sounds like a bum, he lives in Oregon after being a lawyer. Her parents split a time ago."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "So she's a long way from home. Probably needs a friend, along more mature lines."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Well I'm right there across the hall from her."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You're family, champ. That doesn't count. Also you don't appreciate this chick and no doubt she twigs to that. Women do."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Charlie, you're old enough to be her father."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Aah. These Mediterranean types, they like to see a little gray hair on the chest. The old mastoras."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What about your lousy ticker?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Charlie smiled and put his spoon into the cold spinach soup that Melanie had brought. "Good a way to go as any."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Charlie, you're crazy," Rabbit said admiringly, admiring yet once again in their long relationship what he fancies as the other man's superior grip upon the basic elements of life, elements that Harry can never settle in his mind.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Being crazy's what keeps us alive," Charlie said, and sipped, closing his eyes behind his tinted glasses to taste the soup better. "Too much nutmeg. Maybe Janice'd like to have me over, it's been a while. So I can feel things out."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Listen, I can't have you over so you can seduce my son's girlfriend."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You said she wasn't a girlfriend."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I said they didn't act like it, but then what do I know?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You have a pretty good nose. I trust you, champ." He changed the subject slightly. "How come Nelson keeps showing up at the lot?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't know, with Melanie off at work he doesn't have much to do, hanging around the house with Bessie, going over to the club with Janice swimming till his eyes get pink from the chlorine. He shopped around town a little for a job but no luck. I don't think he tried too hard."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Maybe we could fit him in at the lot."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't want that. Things are cozy enough around here for him already."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He going back to college?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I don't know. I'm scared to ask."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Stavros put down his soup spoon carefully. "Scared to ask," he repeated. "And you're paying the bills. If my father had ever said to anybody he was scared of anything to do with me, I think the roof would have come off the house."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Maybe scared isn't the word."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Scared is the word you used." He looked up squinting in what seemed to be pain through his thick glasses to perceive Melanie more clearly as, in a flurry of purple colonial flounces, she set before Harry a Crépe con Zucchini and before Charlie a Crépe aux Champignons et Oignons. The scent of their vegetable steam remained like a cloud of perfume she had released from the frills of her costume before flying away. "Nice," Charlie said, not of the food. "Very nice." Rabbit still couldn't see it. He thought of her body without the frills and got nothing in the way of feeling except a certain fear, as if seeing a weapon unsheathed, or gazing upon an inflexible machine with which his soft body should not become involved.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> But he feels obliged one night to say to Janice, "We haven't had Charlie over for a while."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She looks at him curiously. "You want to? Don't you see enough of him at the lot?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah but you don't see him there."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Charlie and I had our time, of seeing each other."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Look, the guy lives with his mother who's getting to be more and more of a drag, he's never married, he's always talking about his nieces and nephews but I don't think they give him shit actually -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "All right, you don't have to sell it. I like seeing Charlie. I must say I think it's creepy that you encourage it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why shouldn't I? Because of that old business? I don't hold a grudge. It made you a better person."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Thanks," Janice says dryly. Guiltily he tries to count up how many nights since he's given her an orgasm. These July nights, you get thirsty for one more beer as the Phillies struggle and then in bed feel a terrific weariness, a bliss of inactivity that leads you to understand how men can die willingly, gladly, into an eternal release from the hell of having to perform. When Janice hasn't been fucked for a while, her gestures speed up, and the thought of Charlie's coming intensifies this agitation. "What night?" she asks.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Whenever. What's Melanie's schedule this week?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What does that have to do with it?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He might as well meet her properly. I took him over to the crépe place for lunch and though she tried to be pleasant she was rushed and it didn't really work out."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What would `work out' mean, if it did?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't give me a hard time, it's too fucking humid. I've been thinking of asking Ma to go halves with us on a new air?conditioner, I read where a make called Friedrich is best. I mean `work out' just as ordinary human interchange. He kept asking me embarrassing questions about Nelson."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Like what? What's so embarrassing about Nelson?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Like whether or not he was going to go back to college and why he kept showing up at the lot."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why shouldn't he show up at the lot? It was his grandfather's. And Nelson's always loved cars."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Loves to bounce 'em around, at least. The Mustang has a whole new set of rattles, have you noticed?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I hadn't noticed," Janice says primly, pouring herself more Campari. In an attempt to cut down her alcohol intake, to slow down creeping middle?itis, she has appointed Campari?and?soda her summer drink; but keeps forgetting to put in the soda. She adds, "He's used to those flat Ohio roads."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Out at Kent Nelson had bought some graduating senior's old Thunderbird and then when he decided to go to Colorado sold it for half what he paid. Remembering this adds to Rabbit's suffocating sensation of being put upon. He tells her, "They have the fifty?five?mile?an?hour speed limit out there too. The poor country is trying to save gas before the Arabs turn our dollars into zinc pennies and that baby boy of yours does fifty?five in second gear."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice knows he is trying to get her goat now, and turns her back with that electric swiftness, as of speeded?up film, and heads toward the dining?room phone. "I'll ask him for next week," she says. "If that'll make you less bitchy."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Charlie always brings flowers, in a stapled green cone of paper, that he hands to Ma Springer. After all those years of kissing Springer's ass he knows his way around the widow. Bessie takes them without much of a smile; her maiden name was Koerner and she never wholly approved of Fred's taking on a Greek, and then her foreboding came true when Charlie had an affair with Janice with such disastrous consequences, around the time of the moon landing. Well, nobody is going to the moon much these days.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The flowers, unwrapped, are roses the color of a palomino horse. Janice puts them in a vase, cooing. She has dolled up in a perky daisy?patterned sundress for the occasion, that shows off her brown shoulders, and wears her long hair up in the heat, to remind them all of her slender neck and to display the gold necklace of tiny overlapping fish scales that Harry gave her for their twentieth wedding anniversary three years ago. Paid nine hundred dollars for it then, and it must be worth fifteen hundred now, gold going crazy the way it is. She leans forward to give Charlie a kiss, on the mouth and not the cheek, thus effortlessly reminding those who watch of how these two bodies have travelled within one another. "Charlie, you look too thin," Janice says. "Don't you know how to feed yourself?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I pack it in, Jan, but it doesn't stick to the ribs anymore. You look terrific, on the other hand."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Melanie's got us all on a health kick. Isn't that right, Mother? Wheat germ and alfalfa sprouts and I don't know what all. Yogurt."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I feel better, honest to God," Bessie pronounces. "I don't know though if it's the diet or just having a little more life around the house."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Charlie's square fingertips are still resting on Janice's brown arm. Rabbit sees the phenomenon as he would something else in nature ? a Japanese beetle on a leaf, or two limbs of a tree rubbing together in the wind. Then he remembers, descending into the molecules, what love feels like: huge, skin on skin, planets impinging.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "We all eat too much sugar and sodium," Melanie says, in that happy uplifted voice of hers, that seems unconnected to what is below, like a blessing no one has asked for. Charlie's hand has snapped away from Janice's skin; he is all warrior attention; his profile in the gloom of this front room through which all visitors to this household must pass shines, low?browed and jut jawed, the muscles around the hollow of his jaw pulsing. He looks younger than at the lot, maybe because the light is poorer.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Melanie," Harry says, "you remember Charlie from lunch the other day, doncha?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Of course. He had the mushrooms and capers."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Onions," Charlie says, his hand still poised to take hers.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Charlie's my right?hand man over there, or I'm his is I guess how he'd put it. He's been moving cars for Springer Motors since -" He can't think of a joke.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Since they were called horseless buggies," Charlie says, and takes her hand in his. Watching, Harry marvels at her young hand's narrowness. We broaden all over. Old ladies' feet: they look like little veiny loaves of bread, rising. Away from her spacey stare Melanie is knit as tight together as a new sock. Charlie is moving in on her. "How are you, Melanie? How're you liking these parts?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "They're nice," she smiles. "Quaint, almost."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Harry tells me you're a West Coast baby."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Her eyes lift, so the whites beneath the irises show, as she looks toward her distant origins. "Oh yes. I was born in Marin County. My mother lives now in a place called Carmel. That's to the south."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I've heard of it," Charlie says. "You've got some rock stars there."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Not really, I don't think . . . . Joan Baez, but she's more what you'd call traditional. We live in what used to be our summer place."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "How'd that happen?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Startled, she tells him. "My father used to work in San Francisco as a corporation lawyer. Then he and my mother broke up and we had to sell the house on Pacific Avenue. Now he's in Oregon learning to be a forester."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That's a sad story, you could say," Harry says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Daddy doesn't think so," Melanie tells him. "He's living with a lovely girl who's part Yakima Indian."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Back to Nature," Charlie says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's the only way to go," Rabbit says. "Have some soybeans."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> This is a joke, for he is passing them Planter's dry?roasted cashews in a breakfast bowl, nuts that he bought on impulse at the grocery next to the state liquor store fifteen minutes ago, running out in the rattling Mustang to stoke up for tonight's company. He had been almost scared off by the price on the jar, $2.89, up 30￠ from the last time he'd noticed, and reached for the dry?roasted peanuts instead. Even these, though, were over a dollar, $1.09, peanuts that you used to buy a big sack of unshelled for a quarter when he was a boy, so he thought, What the hell's the point of being rich, and took the cashews after all.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He is offended when Charlie glances down and holds up a fastidious palm, not taking any. "No salt," Harry urges. "Loaded with protein."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Never touch junk," Charlie says. "Doc says it's a no?no."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Junk!" he begins to argue.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> But Charlie is keeping the pressure on Melanie. "Every winter, I head down to Florida for a month. Sarasota, on the Gulf side."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What's that got to do with California?" Janice asks, cutting in.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Same type of Paradise," Charlie says, turning a shoulder so as to keep speaking directly to Melanie. "It's my meat. Sand in your shoes, that's the feeling, wearing the same ragged cut?offs day after day. This is over on the Gulf side. I hate the Miami side. The only way you'd get me over on the Miami side would ??be inside an alligator. They have 'em, too: come up out of these canals right onto your lawn and eat your pet dog. It happens a lot.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I've never been to Florida," Melanie says, looking a little glazed, even for her.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You should give it a try," Charlie says. "It's where the real people are."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You mean we're not real people?" Rabbit asks, egging him on, helping Janice out. This must hurt her. He takes a cashew between his molars and delicately cracks it, prolonging the bliss. That first fracture, in there with tongue and spit and teeth. He loves nuts. Clean eating, not like meat. In the Garden of Eden they ate nuts and fruit. Dry?roasted, the cashew bums a little. He prefers them salted, soaked in sodium, but got this kind in deference to Melanie; he's being brainwashed about chemicals. Still, some chemical must have entered into this dry?roasting too, there's nothing you can eat won't hurt you down here on earth. Janice must just hate this.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's not just all old people either," Charlie is telling Melanie. "You see plenty of young people down there too, just living in their skins. Gorgeous."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Janice," Mrs. Springer says, pronouncing it Chaniss. "We should go on the porch and you should offer people drinks." To Charlie she says, "Melanie made a lovely fruit punch."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> j "How much gin can it absorb?" Charlie asks.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry loves this guy, even if he is putting the make on Melanie in front of Janice. On the porch, when they've settled on the aluminum furniture with their drinks and Janice is in the kitchen stirring at the dinner, he asks him, to show him off, "How'd you like Carter's energy speech?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Charlie cocks his head toward the rosy?cheeked girl and says, "I thought it was pathetic. The man was right. I'm suffering from a crisis in confidence. In him."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nobody laughs, except Harry. Charlie passes the ball. "What did you think of it, Mrs. Springer?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The old lady, called onto the stage, smooths the cloth of her lap and looks down as if for crumbs. "He seems a well?intentioned Christian man, though Fred always used to say the Democrats were just a tool for the unions. Still and all. Some businessman in there might have a better idea what to do with the inflation."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He is a businessman, Bessie," Harry says. "He grows peanuts. His warehouse down there grosses more than we do."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I thought it was sad," Melanie unexpectedly says, leaning forward so her loose gypsyish blouse reveals cleavage, a tube of air between her braless breasts, "the way he said people for the first time think things are going to get worse instead of better."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Sad if you're a chick like you," Charlie says. "For old crocks like us, things are going to get worse in any case."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You believe that?" Harry asks, genuinely surprised. He sees his life as just beginning, on clear ground at last, now that he has a margin of resources, and the stifled terror that always made him restless has dulled down. He wants less. Freedom, that he always thought was outward motion, turns out to be this inner dwindling.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I believe it, sure," Charlie says, "but what does this nice girl here believe? That the show's over? How can she?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I believe," Melanie begins. "Oh, I don't know ? Bessie, help me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry didn't know she calls the old lady by her first name. Took him years of living with her to work up to feeling easy about that, and it wasn't really until after one day he had accidentally walked in on her in her bathroom, Janice hogging theirs.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Say what's on your mind," the old woman advises the younger. "Everybody else is."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The luminous orbs of Melanie's eyes scout their faces in a sweep that ends in an upward roll such as you see in images of saints. "I believe the things we're running out of we can learn to do without. I don't need electric carving knives and all that. I'm more upset about the snail darters and the whales than about iron ore and oil." She lingers on this last word, giving it two syllables, and stares at Harry. As if he's especially into oil. He decides what he resents about her is she seems always to be trying to hypnotize him. "I mean," she goes on, "as long as there are growing things, there's still a world with endless possibilities."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The hum beneath her words hangs in the darkening space of the porch. Alien. Moonraker.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "One big weed patch," Harry says. "Where the hell is Nelson, anyway?" He is irked, he figures, because this girl is out of this world and that makes his world feel small. He feels sexier even toward fat old Bessie. At least her voice has a lot of the county, a lot of his life, in it. That time he blundered into the bathroom he didn't see much; she shouted, sitting on the toilet with her skirt around her knees, and he heard her shout and hardly saw a thing, just a patch of flank as white as a butcher's marble counter.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Bessie answers him dolefully, "I believe he went out for a reason. Janice would know."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice comes to the doorway of the porch, looking snappy in her daisies and an orange apron. "He went off around six with Billy Fosnacht. They should have been back by now."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Which car'd they take?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "They had to take the Corona. You were at the liquor store with the Mustang."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh great. What's Billy Fosnacht doing around anyway? Why isn't he in the volunteer army?" He feels like making a show, for Charlie and Melanie, of authority.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> There is authority, too, in the way Janice is holding a wooden stirring spoon. She says, to the company in general, "They say he's doing very well. He's in his first year of dental school up somewhere in New England. He wants to be a, what do they call it ??"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Ophthalmologist," Rabbit says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Endodontist."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "My God," is all Harry can say. Ten years ago, the night his house had burned, Billy had called his mother a bitch. He had seen Billy often since, all the years Nelson was at Mt. Judge High, but had never forgotten that, how Peggy had then slapped him, this little boy just thirteen years old, the marks of her fingers leaping up pink on the child's delicate cheek. Then he had called her a whore, Harry's jism warm inside her. Later that night Nelson had vowed to kill his father. You fucking asshole, you've let her die. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. Harry had put up his hands to fight. The misery of life. It has carried him away from the faces on the porch. In the silence he hears from afar a neighbor woman's hammer knocking. "How are Ollie and Peggy?" he asks, his voice rough even after clearing it. Billy's parents have dropped from his sight, as the Toyota business lifted him higher in the social scale.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "About the same," Janice says. "Ollie's still at the music store. They say Peggy's gotten into causes." She turns back to her stirring.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Charlie tells Melanie, "You should book yourself on a flight to Florida when you get fed up around here."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What's with you and Florida?" Harry asks him loudly. "She says she comes from California and you keep pushing Florida at her. There's no connection."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Charlie pulls at his spiked pink punch and looks like a pathetic old guy, the skin pegged ever tighter to the planes of his skull. "We can make a connection."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Melanie calls toward the kitchen, ` "Janice, can I be of any help?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No dear, thanks; it's all but done. Is everybody starving? Does anybody else want their drink freshened?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Why not?" Harry asks, feeling reckless. This bunch isn't going to be fun, he'll have to make his fun inside. "How about you, Charlie?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Forget it, champ. One's my limit. The doctors tell me even that should be a no?no, in my condition." Of Melanie he asks, "How's your Kool?Aid holding up?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't call it Kool?Aid, that's rude," Harry says, pretending to joust. "I admire anybody of this generation who isn't polluting their system with pills and booze. Ever since Nelson got back, the sixpacks come and go in the fridge like, like coal down a chute." He feels he has said this before, recently.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I'll get you some more," Melanie sings, and takes Charlie's glass, and Harry's too. She has no name for him, he notices. Nelson's father. Over the hill. Out of this world.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Make mine weak," he tells her. "A g?and?t."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ma Springer has been sitting there with thoughts of her own. She says to Stavros, "Nelson has been asking me all these questions about how the lot works, how much sales help there is, and how the salesmen are paid, and so on."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Charlie shifts his weight in his chair. "This gas crunch's got to affect car sales. People won't buy cows they can't feed. Even if so far Toyota's come along smelling pretty good."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry intervenes. "Bessie, there's no way we can make room for Nelson on sales without hurting Jake and Rudy. They're married men trying to feed babies on their commissions. If you want I could talk to Manny and see if he can use another kid on cleanup
<br> 
<br> "He doesn't want to work on clean?up," Janice calls sharply from the kitchen.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ma Springer confirms, "Yes, he told me he'd like to see what he could do with sales, you know he always admired Fred so, idolized him you might say -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh come on," Harry says. "He never gave a damn about either of his grandfathers once he hit about tenth grade. Once he got onto girls and rock he thought everybody over twenty was a sap. All he wanted was to get the hell out of Brewer, and I said, O.K., here's the ticket, go to it. So what's he pussy?footing around whispering to his mother and grandmother now for?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Melanie brings in the two men's drinks. Waitressly erect, she holds a triangulated paper napkin around the dewy base of each. Rabbit sips his and fords it strong when he asked for it weak. A love message, of sorts?
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Ma Springer puts one hand on each of her thighs and points her elbows out, elbows all in folds like little pug dog faces. "Now Harry -"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I know what you're going to say. You own half the company. Good for you, Bessie, I'm glad. If it'd been me instead of Fred I'd've left it all to you." He quickly turns to Melanie and says, "What they really should do with this gas crisis is bring back the trolley cars. You're too young to remember. They ran on tracks but the power came from electric wires overhead. Very clean. They went everywhere when I was a kid."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh, I know. They still have them in San Francisco."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Harry, what I wanted to say
<br> 
<br> "But you're not running it," he continues to his mother?in?law, "and never have, and as long as I am, Nelson, if he wants a start there, can hose down cars for Manny. I don't want him in the sales room. He has none of the right attitudes. He can't even straighten up and smile."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I thought those were cable cars," Charlie says to Melanie.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh they just have those on a few hills. Everybody keeps saying how dangerous they are, the cables snap. But the tourists expect them."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Harry. Dinner," Janice says. She is stern. "We won't wait for Nelson any more, it's after eight."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Sorry if I sound hard," he says to the group as they rise to go eat. "But look, even now, the kid's too rude to come home in time for dinner."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Your own son," Janice says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Melanie, what do you think? What's his plan? Isn't he heading back to finish college?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Her smile remains fixed but seems flaky, painted?on. "Nelson may feel," she says carefully, "that he's spent enough time at college."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "But where's his degree?" He hears his own voice in his head as shrill, sounding trapped. "Where's his degree?" Harry repeats, hearing no answer.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice has lit candles on the dining table, though the July day is still so light they look wan. She had wanted this to be nice for Charlie. Dear old Jan. As Harry walks to the table behind her he rests his eyes on what he rarely sees, the pale bared nape of her neck. In the shuffle as they take places he brushes Melanie's arm, bare also, and darts a look down the ripe slopes loosely concealed by the gypsy blouse. Firm. He mutters to her, "Sorry, didn't mean to put you on the spot just now. I just can't figure out what Nelson's game is."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh you didn't," she answers crooningly. Ringlets fall and tremble; her cheeks flame within. As Ma Springer plods to her place at the head of the table, the girl peeks up at Harry with a glint he reads as sly and adds, "I think one factor, you know, is Nelson's becoming more security?minded."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He can't quite follow. Sounds like the kid is going to enter the Secret Service.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Chairs scrape. They wait while a dim tribal memory of grace flits overhead. Then Janice dips her spoon into her soup, tomato, the color of Harry's Corona. Where is it? Out in the night, with the kid at the wheel making every joint rattle. They rarely sit in this room ? even with the five of them now they eat around the 'kitchen table ? and Harry is newly aware of, propped on the sideboard where the family silver is stored, tinted photos of Janice as a high?school senior with her hair brushed and rolled under in a page?boy to her shoulders, of Nelson as an infant propped with his favorite teddy bear (that had one eye) on a stagy sunbathed window seat of this very house, and then Nelson as himself a highschool senior, his hair almost as long as Janice's, but less brushed, looking greasy, and his grin for the cameraman lopsided, halfdefiant. In a gold frame broader than his daughter and grandson got, Fred Springer, misty?eyed and wrinkle?free courtesy of the portrait studio's darkroom magic, stares in studied three?quarters profile at whatever it is the dead see.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Charlie asks the table, "Did you see where Nixon gave a big party at San Clemente in honor of the moon?landing anniversary? They should keep that guy around forever, as an example of what sheer gall can do."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "He did some good things," Ma Springer says, in that voice of hers that shows hurt, tight and dried?out, somehow. Harry is sensitive to it after all these years.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He tries to help her, to apologize if he had been rough with her over who ran the company. "He opened up China," he says.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "And what a can of worms that's turned out to be," Stavros says. "At least all those years they were hating our guts they didn't cost us a nickel. This party of his wasn't cheap either. Everybody was there ? Red Skelton, Buzz Aldrin."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You know I think it broke Fred's heart," Ma Springer pronounces. "Watergate. He followed it right to the end, when he could hardly lift his head from the pillows, and he used to say to me, 'Bessie, there's never been a President who hasn't done worse. They just have it in for him because he isn't a glamour boy. If that had been Roosevelt or one of the Kennedys,' he'd say, `you would never have heard "boo" about Watergate.' He believed it, too.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry glances at the gold?framed photograph and imagines it nodded. "I believe it," he says. "Old man Springer never steered me wrong." Bessie glances at him to see if this is sarcasm. He keeps his face motionless as a photograph.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Speaking of Kennedys," Charlie puts in ? he really is talking too much, on that one Kool?Aid ? "the papers are sure giving Chappaquiddick another go?around. You wonder, how much more can they say about a guy on his way to neck who drives off a bridge instead?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Bessie may have had a touch of sherry, too, for she is working herself up to tears. "Fred," she says, "would never settle on its being that simple. `Look at the result,' he said to me more than once. `Look at the result, and work backwards from that."' Her berry?dark eyes challenge them to do so, mysteriously. "What was the result?" This seems to be in her own voice. "The result was, a poor girl from up in the coal regions was killed."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh Mother," Janice says. "Daddy just had it in for Democrats. I loved him dearly, but he was absolutely hipped on that."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Charlie says, "I don't know, Jan. The worst things I ever heard your father say about Roosevelt was that he tricked us into war and died with his mistress, and it turns out both are true." He looks in the candlelight after saying this like a cardsharp who has snapped down an ace. "And what they tell us now about how Jack Kennedy carried on in the White House with racketeers' molls and girls right off the street Fred Springer in his wildest dreams would never have come up with." Another ace. He looks, Harry thinks, like old man Springer in a way: that hollow?templed, wellcombed look. Even the little dabs of eyebrows sticking out like toy artillery.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry says, "I never understood what was so bad about Chappaquiddick. He tried to get her out." Water, flames, the tongues of God: a man is helpless.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What was bad about it," Bessie says, "was he put her in."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "What do you think about all this, Melanie?" Harry asks, playing cozy to get Charlie's goat. "Which party do you back?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh the parties," she exclaims in a trance. "I think they're both evil." Ev?il: a word in the air. "But on Chappaquiddick a friend of mine spends every summer on the island and she says she wonders why more people don't drive off that bridge, there are no guard rails or anything. This is lovely soup," she adds to Janice.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "That spinach soup the other day was terrific," Charlie tells Melanie. "Maybe a little heavy on the nutmeg."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Janice has been smoking a cigarette and listening for a car door to slam. "Harry, could you help me clear? You might want to carve in the kitchen."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The kitchen is suffused with the strong, repugnant smell of roasting lamb. Harry doesn't like to be reminded that these are living things, with eyes and hearts, that we eat; he likes salted nuts, hamburger, Chinese food, mince pie. "You know I can't carve lamb," he says. "Nobody can. You're just having it because you think it's what Greeks eat, showing off for your old lover boy."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> She hands him the carving set with the bumpy bone handles. "You've done it a hundred times. Just cut parallel slices perpendicular to the bone."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Sounds easy. You do it if it's so fucking easy." He is thinking, stabbing someone is probably harder than the movies make it look, cutting underdone meat there's plenty of resistance, rubbery and tough. He'd rather hit her on the head with a rock, if it came to that, or that green glass egg Ma has as a knickknack in the living room.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Listen," Janice hisses. A car door has slammed on the street. Footsteps pound on a porch, their porch, and the reluctant front door pops open with a bang. A chorus of voices around the table greet Nelson. But he keeps coming, searching for his parents, and finds them in the kitchen. "Nelson," Janice says. "We were getting worried."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The boy is panting, not with exertion but the shallow?lunged panting of fear. He looks small but muscular in his grape?colored tie?dyed T?shirt: a burglar dressed to shinny in a window. But caught, here, in the bright kitchen light. He avoids looking Harry in the eye. "Dad. There's been a bit of a mishap."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "The car. I knew it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Yeah. The Toyota got a scrape."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "My Corona. Whaddeya mean, a scrape?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Nobody was hurt, don't get carried away."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Any other car involved?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "No, so don't worry, nobody's going to sue." The assurance is contemptuous.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't get smart with me."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "O.K., O.K., Jesus."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "You drove it home?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The boy nods.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Harry hands the knife back to Janice and leaves the kitchen to address the candlelit group left at the table ? Ma at the head, Melanie bright?eyed next to her, Charlie on Melanie's other side, his square cufflink reflecting a bit of flame. "Everybody keep calm. Just a mishap, Nelson says. Charlie, you want to come carve some lamb for me? I got to look at this."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> He wants to put his hands on the boy, whether to give him a push or comfort he doesn't know; the actual touch might demonstrate which, but Nelson stays just ahead of his father's fingertips, dodging into the summer night. The streetlights have come on, and the Corona's tomato color looks evil by the poisonous sodium glow ? a hollow shade of black, its metallic lustre leeched away. Nelson in his haste has parked it illegally, the driver's side along the curb. Harry says, "This side looks fine."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "It's the other side, Dad." Nelson explains: "See Billy and I were coming back from Allenville where his girlfriend lives by this windy back road and because I knew I was getting late for supper I may have been going a little fast, I don't know, you can't go too' fast on those back roads anyway, they wind too much. And this woodchuck or whatever it was comes out in front of me and in trying to avoid it I get off the road a little and the back end slides into this telephone pole. It happened so fast, I couldn't believe it."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rabbit has moved to the other side and by lurid light views the damage. The scrape had begun in the middle of the rear door and deepened over the little gas?cap door; by the time the pole reached the tail signal and the small rectangular sidelight, it had no trouble ripping them right out, the translucent plastic torn and shed like Christmas wrapping, and inches of pretty color?coded wiring exposed. The urethane bumper, so black and mat and trim, that gave Harry a small sensuous sensation whenever he touched the car home against the concrete parking?space divider at the place on the lot stencilled ANGSTROM, was pulled out from the frame. The dent even carried up into the liftback door, which would never seat exactly right again.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nelson is chattering, "Billy knows this kid who works in a body shop over near the bridge to West Brewer and he says you should get some real expensive rip?offplace to do the estimate and then when you get the check from the insurance company give it to him and he can do it for less. That way there'll be a profit everybody can split."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "A profit," Harry repeats numbly.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Nails or rivets in the pole have left parallel longitudinal gashes the length of the impact depression. The chrome?and?rubber stripping has been wrenched loose at an angle, and behind the wheel socket on this side ? hooded with a slightly protruding flare like an eyebrow, one of the many snug Japanese details he has cherished ? a segment of side strip has vanished entirely, leaving a chorus of tiny holes. Even the many?ribbed hubcap is dented and besmirched. He feels his own side has taken a wound. He feels he is witnessing in evil light a crime in which he has collaborated.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Oh come on, Dad," Nelson is saying. "Don't make such a big deal of it. It'll cost the insurance company, not you, to get it fixed, and anyway you can get a new one for almost nothing, don't they give you a terrific discount?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Terrific," Rabbit says. "You just went out and smashed it up. My Corona."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "I didn't mean to, it was an accident, shit. What do you want me to do, piss blood? Get down on my knees and cry?"
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Don't bother."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> "Dad, it's just a thing; you're looking like you lost your best friend."
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> A breeze, too high to touch them, ruffles the treetops and makes the streetlight shudder on the deformed metal. Harry sighs. "Well. How'd the woodchuck do?"
