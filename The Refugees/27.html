A Dwindling Island.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      Amos Green was aroused in the morning by a hand upon his shoulder, and springing to his feet, found De Catinat standing beside him. The survivors of the crew were grouped about the upturned boat, slumbering heavily after their labours of the night. The red rim of the sun had just pushed itself above the water-line, and sky and sea were one blaze of scarlet and orange from the dazzling gold of the horizon to the lightest pink at the zenith. The first rays flashed directly into their cave, sparkling and glimmering upon the ice crystals and tingeing the whole grotto with a rich warm light. Never was a fairy’s palace more lovely than this floating refuge which Nature had provided for them.
<br> 
<br> But neither the American nor the Frenchman had time now to give a thought to the novelty and beauty of their situation. The latter’s face was grave, and his friend read danger in his eyes.
<br> 
<br> “What is it, then?”
<br> 
<br> “The berg. It is coming to pieces.”
<br> 
<br> “Tut, man, it is as solid as an island.”
<br> 
<br> “I have been watching it. You see that crack which extends backwards from the end of our grotto. Two hours ago I could scarce put my hand into it. Now I can slip through it with ease. I tell you that she is splitting across.”
<br> 
<br> Amos Green walked to the end of the funnel-shaped recess and found, as his friend had said, that a green sinuous crack extended away backwards into the iceberg, caused either by the tossing of the waves, or by the terrific impact of their vessel. He roused Captain Ephraim and pointed out the danger to him.
<br> 
<br> “Well, if she springs a leak we are gone,” said he. “She’s been thawing pretty fast as it is.”
<br> 
<br> They could see now that what had seemed in the moonlight to be smooth walls of ice were really furrowed and wrinkled like an old man’s face by the streams of melted water which were continually running down them. The whole huge mass was brittle and honeycombed and rotten. Already they could hear all round them the ominous drip, drip, and the splash and tinkle of the little rivulets as they fell into the ocean.
<br> 
<br> “Hullo!” cried Amos Green, “what’s that?”
<br> 
<br> “What then?”
<br> 
<br> “Did you hear nothing?”
<br> 
<br> “No.”
<br> 
<br> “I could have sworn that I heard a voice.”
<br> 
<br> “Impossible. We are all here.”
<br> 
<br> “It must have been my fancy then.”
<br> 
<br> Captain Ephraim walked to the seaward face of the cave and swept the ocean with his eyes. The wind had quite fallen away now, and the sea stretched away to the eastward, smooth and unbroken save for a single great black spar which floated near the spot where the Golden Rod had foundered.
<br> 
<br> “We should lie in the track of some ships,” said the captain thoughtfully. “There’s the codders and the herring-busses. We’re over far south for them, I reckon. But we can’t be more’n two hundred mile from Port Royal in Arcadia, and we’re in the line of the St. Lawrence trade. If I had three white mountain pines, Amos, and a hundred yards of stout canvas I’d get up on the top of this thing, d’ye see, and I’d rig such a jury-mast as would send her humming into Boston Bay. Then I’d break her up and sell her for what she was worth, and turn a few pieces over the business. But she’s a heavy old craft, and that’s a fact, though even now she might do a knot or two an hour if she had a hurricane behind her. But what is it, Amos?”
<br> 
<br> The young hunter was standing with his ear slanting, his head bent forwards, and his eyes glancing sideways like a man who listens intently. He was about to answer when De Catinat gave a cry and pointed to the back of the cave.
<br> 
<br> “Look at the crack now.”
<br> 
<br> It had widened by a foot since they had noticed it last, until it was now no longer a crack. It was a pass.
<br> 
<br> “Let us go through,” said the captain.
<br> 
<br> “It can but come out on the other side.”
<br> 
<br> “Then let us see the other side.”
<br> 
<br> He led the way and the other two followed him. It was very dark as they advanced, with high dripping ice walls on either side and one little zigzagging slit of blue sky above their heads. Tripping and groping their way, they stumbled along until suddenly the passage grew wider and opened out into a large square of flat ice. The berg was level in the centre and sloped upwards from that point to the high cliffs which bounded it on each side. In three directions this slope was very steep, but in one it slanted up quite gradually, and the constant thawing had grooved the surface with a thousand irregularities by which an active man could ascend. With one impulse they began all three to clamber up until a minute later they were standing not far from the edge of the summit, seventy feet above the sea, with a view which took in a good fifty miles of water. In all that fifty miles there was no sign of life, nothing but the endless glint of the sun upon the waves.
<br> 
<br> Captain Ephraim whistled. “We are out of luck,” said he.
<br> 
<br> Amos Green looked about him with startled eyes. “I cannot understand it,” said he. “I could have sworn—By the eternal, listen to that!” The clear call of a military bugle rang out in the morning air. With a cry of amazement they all three craned forward and peered over the edge.
<br> 
<br> A large ship was lying under the very shadow of the iceberg. They looked straight down upon her snow-white decks, fringed with shining brass cannon, and dotted with seamen. A little clump of soldiers stood upon the poop going through the manual exercise, and it was from them that the call had come which had sounded so unexpectedly in the ears of the castaways. Standing back from the edge, they had not only looked over the top-masts of this welcome neighbour, but they had themselves been invisible from her decks. Now the discovery was mutual, as was shown by a chorus of shouts and cries from beneath them.
<br> 
<br> But the three did not wait an instant. Sliding and scrambling down the wet, slippery incline, they rushed shouting through the crack and into the cave where their comrades had just been startled by the bugle-call while in the middle of their cheerless breakfast. A few hurried words and the leaky long-boat had been launched, their possessions had been bundled in, and they were afloat once more. Pulling round a promontory of the berg, they found themselves under the stern of a fine corvette, the sides of which were lined with friendly faces, while from the peak there drooped a huge white banner mottled over with the golden lilies of France. In a very few minutes their boat had been hauled up and they found themselves on board the St. Christophe man-of-war, conveying Marquis de Denonville, the new Governor–General of Canada, to take over his duties.
