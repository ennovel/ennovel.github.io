Children Of Belial.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      The elderly Huguenot had stood silent after his repulse by the king, with his eyes cast moodily downwards, and a face in which doubt, sorrow, and anger contended for the mastery. He was a very large, gaunt man, raw-boned and haggard, with a wide forehead, a large, fleshy nose, and a powerful chin. He wore neither wig nor powder, but Nature had put her own silvering upon his thick grizzled locks, and the thousand puckers which clustered round the edges of his eyes, or drew at the corners of his mouth, gave a set gravity to his face which needed no device of the barber to increase it. Yet in spite of his mature years, the swift anger with which he had sprung up when the king refused his plaint, and the keen fiery glance which he had shot at the royal court as they filed past him with many a scornful smile and whispered gibe at his expense, all showed that he had still preserved something of the strength and of the spirit of his youth. He was dressed as became his rank, plainly and yet well, in a sad-coloured brown kersey coat with silver-plated buttons, knee-breeches of the same, and white woollen stockings, ending in broad-toed black leather shoes cut across with a great steel buckle. In one hand he carried his low felt hat, trimmed with gold edging, and in the other a little cylinder of paper containing a recital of his wrongs, which he had hoped to leave in the hands of the king’s secretary.
<br> 
<br> His doubts as to what his next step should be were soon resolved for him in a very summary fashion. These were days when, if the Huguenot was not absolutely forbidden in France, he was at least looked upon as a man who existed upon sufferance, and who was unshielded by the laws which protected his Catholic fellow-subjects. For twenty years the stringency of the persecution had increased until there was no weapon which bigotry could employ, short of absolute expulsion, which had not been turned against him. He was impeded in his business, elbowed out of all public employment, his house filled with troops, his children encouraged to rebel against him, and all redress refused him for the insults and assaults to which he was subjected. Every rascal who wished to gratify his personal spite, or to gain favour with his bigoted superiors, might do his worst upon him without fear of the law. Yet, in spite of all, these men clung to the land which disowned them, and, full of the love for their native soil which lies so deep in a Frenchman’s heart, preferred insult and contumely at home to the welcome which would await them beyond the seas. Already, however, the shadow of those days was falling upon them when the choice should no longer be theirs.
<br> 
<br> Two of the king’s big blue-coated guardsmen were on duty at that side of the palace, and had been witnesses to his unsuccessful appeal. Now they tramped across together to where he was standing, and broke brutally into the current of his thoughts.
<br> 
<br> “Now, Hymn-books,” said one gruffly, “get off again about your business.”
<br> 
<br> “You’re not a very pretty ornament to the king’s pathway,” cried the other, with a hideous oath. “Who are you, to turn up your nose at the king’s religion, curse you?”
<br> 
<br> The old Huguenot shot a glance of anger and contempt at them, and was turning to go, when one of them thrust at his ribs with the butt end of his halberd.
<br> 
<br> “Take that, you dog!” he cried. “Would you dare to look like that at the king’s guard?”
<br> 
<br> “Children of Belial,” cried the old man, with his hand pressed to his side, “were I twenty years younger you would not have dared to use me so.”
<br> 
<br> “Ha! you would still spit your venom, would you? That is enough, Andre! He has threatened the king’s guard. Let us seize him and drag him to the guard-room.”
<br> 
<br> The two soldiers dropped their halberds and rushed upon the old man, but, tall and strong as they were, they found it no easy matter to secure him. With his long sinewy arms and his wiry frame, he shook himself clear of them again and again, and it was only when his breath had failed him that the two, torn and panting, were able to twist round his wrists, and so secure him. They had hardly won their pitiful victory, however, before a stern voice and a sword flashing before their eyes, compelled them to release their prisoner once more.
<br> 
<br> It was Captain de Catinat, who, his morning duties over, had strolled out on to the terrace, and had come upon this sudden scene of outrage. At the sight of the old man’s face he gave a violent start, and drawing his sword, had rushed forward with such fury that the two guardsmen not only dropped their victim, but, staggering back from the threatening sword-point, one of them slipped and the other rolled over him, a revolving mass of blue coat and white kersey.
<br> 
<br> “Villains!” roared De Catinat. “What is the meaning of this?”
<br> 
<br> The two had stumbled on to their feet again, very shamefaced and ruffled.
<br> 
<br> “If you please, captain,” said one, saluting, “this is a Huguenot who abused the royal guard.”
<br> 
<br> “His petition had been rejected by the king, captain, and yet he refused to go.”
<br> 
<br> De Catinat was white with fury. “And so, when a French citizen has come to have a word with the great master of his country, he must be harassed by two Swiss dogs like you?” he cried. “By my faith, we shall soon see about that!”
<br> 
<br> He drew a little silver whistle from his pocket, and at the shrill summons an old sergeant and half a dozen soldiers came running from the guard-room.
<br> 
<br> “Your names?” asked the captain sternly.
<br> 
<br> “Andre Meunier.”
<br> 
<br> “And yours?”
<br> 
<br> “Nicholas Klopper.”
<br> 
<br> “Sergeant, you will arrest these men, Meunier and Klopper.”
<br> 
<br> “Certainly, captain,” said the sergeant, a dark grizzled old soldier of Conde and Turenne.
<br> 
<br> “See that they are tried today.”
<br> 
<br> “And on what charge, captain?”
<br> 
<br> “For assaulting an aged and respected citizen who had come on business to the king.”
<br> 
<br> “He was a Huguenot on his own confession,” cried the culprits together.
<br> 
<br> “Hum!” The sergeant pulled doubtfully at his long moustache. “Shall we put the charge in that form, captain? Just as the captain pleases.” He gave a little shrug of his epauletted shoulders to signify his doubt whether any good could arise from it.
<br> 
<br> “No,” said De Catinat, with a sudden happy thought. “I charge them with laying their halberds down while on duty, and with having their uniforms dirty and disarranged.”
<br> 
<br> “That is better,” answered the sergeant, with the freedom of a privileged veteran. “Thunder of God, but you have disgraced the guards! An hour on the wooden horse with a musket at either foot may teach you that halberds were made for a soldier’s hand, and not for the king’s grass-plot. Seize them! Attention! Right half turn! March!”
<br> 
<br> And away went the little clump of guardsmen with the sergeant in the rear.
<br> 
<br> The Huguenot had stood in the background, grave and composed, without any sign of exultation, during this sudden reversal of fortune; but when the soldiers were gone, he and the young officer turned warmly upon each other.
<br> 
<br> “Amory, I had not hoped to see you!”
<br> 
<br> “Nor I you, uncle. What, in the name of wonder, brings you to Versailles?”
<br> 
<br> “My wrongs, Amory. The hand of the wicked is heavy upon us, and whom can we turn to save only the king?”
<br> 
<br> The young officer shook his head. “The king is at heart a good man,” said he. “But he can only see the world through the glasses which are held before him. You have nothing to hope from him.”
<br> 
<br> “He spurned me from his presence.”
<br> 
<br> “Did he ask your name?”
<br> 
<br> “He did, and I gave it.”
<br> 
<br> The young guardsman whistled. “Let us walk to the gate,” said he. “By my faith, if my kinsmen are to come and bandy arguments with the king, it may not be long before my company finds itself without its captain.”
<br> 
<br> “The king would not couple us together. But indeed, nephew, it is strange to me how you can live in this house of Baal and yet bow down to no false gods.”
<br> 
<br> “I keep my belief in my own heart.”
<br> 
<br> The older man shook his head gravely.
<br> 
<br> “Your ways lie along a very narrow path,” said he, “with temptation and danger ever at your feet. It is hard for you to walk with the Lord, Amory, and yet go hand in hand with the persecutors of His people.”
<br> 
<br> “Tut, uncle!” said the young man impatiently. “I am a soldier of the king’s, and I am willing to let the black gown and the white surplice settle these matters between them. Let me live in honour and die in my duty, and I am content to wait to know the rest.”
<br> 
<br> “Content, too, to live in palaces, and eat from fine linen,” said the Huguenot bitterly, “when the hands of the wicked are heavy upon your kinsfolk, and there is a breaking of phials, and a pouring forth of tribulation, and a wailing and a weeping throughout the land.”
<br> 
<br> “What is amiss, then?” asked the young soldier, who was somewhat mystified by the scriptural language in use among the French Calvinists of the day.
<br> 
<br> “Twenty men of Moab have been quartered upon me, with one Dalbert, their captain, who has long been a scourge to Israel.”
<br> 
<br> “Captain Claude Dalbert, of the Languedoc Dragoons? I have already some small score to settle with him.”
<br> 
<br> “Ay, and the scattered remnant has also a score against this murderous dog and self-seeking Ziphite.”
<br> 
<br> “What has he done, then?”
<br> 
<br> “His men are over my house like moths in a cloth bale. No place is free from them. He sits in the room which should be mine, his great boots on my Spanish leather chairs, his pipe in his mouth, his wine-pot at his elbow, and his talk a hissing and an abomination. He has beaten old Pierre of the warehouse.”
<br> 
<br> “Ha!”
<br> 
<br> “And thrust me into the cellar.”
<br> 
<br> “Ha!”
<br> 
<br> “Because I have dragged him back when in his drunken love he would have thrown his arms about your cousin Adele.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh!” The young man’s colour had been rising and his brows knitted at each successive charge, but at this last his anger boiled over, and he hurried forward with fury in his face, dragging his elderly companion by the elbow. They had been passing through one of those winding paths, bordered by high hedges, which thinned away every here and there to give a glimpse of some prowling faun or weary nymph who slumbered in marble amid the foliage. The few courtiers who met them gazed with surprise at so ill-assorted a pair of companions. But the young soldier was too full of his own plans to waste a thought upon their speculations. Still hurrying on, he followed a crescent path which led past a dozen stone dolphins shooting water out of their mouths over a group of Tritons, and so through an avenue of great trees which looked as if they had grown there for centuries, and yet had in truth been carried over that very year by incredible labour from St. Germain and Fontainebleau. Beyond this point a small gate led out of the grounds, and it was through it that the two passed, the elder man puffing and panting with this unusual haste.
<br> 
<br> “How did you come, uncle?”
<br> 
<br> “In a caleche.”
<br> 
<br> “Where is it?”
<br> 
<br> “That is it, beyond the auberge.”
<br> 
<br> “Come, let us make for it.”
<br> 
<br> “And you, Amory, are you coming?”
<br> 
<br> “My faith, it is time that I came, from what you tell me. There is room for a man with a sword at his side in this establishment of yours.”
<br> 
<br> “But what would you do?”
<br> 
<br> “I would have a word with this Captain Dalbert.”
<br> 
<br> “Then I have wronged you, nephew, when I said even now that you were not whole-hearted towards Israel.”
<br> 
<br> “I know not about Israel,” cried De Catinat impatiently. “I only know that if my Adele chose to worship the thunder like an Abenaqui squaw, or turned her innocent prayers to the Mitche Manitou, I should like to set eyes upon the man who would dare to lay a hand upon her. Ha, here comes our caleche! Whip up, driver, and five livres to you if you pass the gate of the Invalides within the hour.”
<br> 
<br> It was no light matter to drive fast in an age of springless carriages and deeply rutted roads, but the driver lashed at his two rough unclipped horses, and the caleche jolted and clattered upon its way. As they sped on, with the road-side trees dancing past the narrow windows, and the white dust streaming behind them, the guardsman drummed his fingers upon his knees, and fidgeted in his seat with impatience, shooting an occasional question across at his grim companion.
<br> 
<br> “When was all this, then?”
<br> 
<br> “It was yesterday night.”
<br> 
<br> “And where is Adele now?”
<br> 
<br> “She is at home.”
<br> 
<br> “And this Dalbert?”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, he is there also!”
<br> 
<br> “What! you have left her in his power while you came away to Versailles?”
<br> 
<br> “She is locked in her room.”
<br> 
<br> “Pah! what is a lock?” The young man raved with his hands in the air at the thought of his own impotence.
<br> 
<br> “And Pierre is there?”
<br> 
<br> “He is useless.”
<br> 
<br> “And Amos Green.”
<br> 
<br> “Ah, that is better. He is a man, by the look of him.”
<br> 
<br> “His mother was one of our own folk from Staten Island, near Manhattan. She was one of those scattered lambs who fled early before the wolves, when first it was seen that the king’s hand waxed heavy upon Israel. He speaks French, and yet he is neither French to the eye, nor are his ways like our ways.”
<br> 
<br> “He has chosen an evil time for his visit.”
<br> 
<br> “Some wise purpose may lie hid in it.”
<br> 
<br> “And you have left him in the house?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes; he was sat with this Dalbert, smoking with him, and telling him strange tales.”
<br> 
<br> “What guard could he be? He is a stranger in a strange land. You did ill to leave Adele thus, uncle.”
<br> 
<br> “She is in God’s hands, Amory.”
<br> 
<br> “I trust so. Oh, I am on fire to be there!”
<br> 
<br> He thrust his head through the cloud of dust which rose from the wheels, and craned his neck to look upon the long curving river and broad-spread city, which was already visible before them, half hid by a thin blue haze, through which shot the double tower of Notre Dame, with the high spire of St. Jacques and a forest of other steeples and minarets, the monuments of eight hundred years of devotion. Soon, as the road curved down to the river-bank, the city wall grew nearer and nearer, until they had passed the southern gate, and were rattling over the stony causeway, leaving the broad Luxembourg upon their right, and Colbert’s last work, the Invalides, upon their left. A sharp turn brought them on to the river quays, and crossing over the Pont Neuf, they skirted the stately Louvre, and plunged into the labyrinth of narrow but important streets which extended to the northward. The young officer had his head still thrust out of the window, but his view was obscured by a broad gilded carriage which lumbered heavily along in front of them. As the road broadened, however, it swerved to one side, and he was able to catch a glimpse of the house to which they were making.
<br> 
<br> It was surrounded on every side by an immense crowd.
