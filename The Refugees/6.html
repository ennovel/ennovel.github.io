A House Of Strife.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      The house of the Huguenot merchant was a tall, narrow building standing at the corner of the Rue St. Martin and the Rue de Biron. It was four stories in height, grim and grave like its owner, with high peaked roof, long diamond-paned windows, a frame-work of black wood, with gray plaster filling the interstices, and five stone steps which led up to the narrow and sombre door. The upper story was but a warehouse in which the trader kept his stock, but the second and third were furnished with balconies edged with stout wooden balustrades. As the uncle and the nephew sprang out of the caleche, they found themselves upon the outskirts of a dense crowd of people, who were swaying and tossing with excitement, their chins all thrown forwards and their gaze directed upwards. Following their eyes, the young officer saw a sight which left him standing bereft of every sensation save amazement.
<br> 
<br> From the upper balcony there was hanging head downwards a man clad in the bright blue coat and white breeches of one of the king’s dragoons. His hat and wig had dropped off, and his close-cropped head swung slowly backwards and forwards a good fifty feet above the pavement. His face was turned towards the street, and was of a deadly whiteness, while his eyes were screwed up as though he dared not open them upon the horror which faced them. His voice, however, resounded over the whole place until the air was filled with his screams for mercy.
<br> 
<br> Above him, at the corner of the balcony, there stood a young man who leaned with a bent back over the balustrades, and who held the dangling dragoon by either ankle. His face, however, was not directed towards his victim, but was half turned over his shoulder to confront a group of soldiers who were clustering at the long, open window which led out into the balcony. His head, as he glanced at them, was poised with a proud air of defiance, while they surged and oscillated in the opening, uncertain whether to rush on or to retire.
<br> 
<br> Suddenly the crowd gave a groan of excitement. The young man had released his grip upon one of the ankles, and the dragoon hung now by one only, his other leg flapping helplessly in the air. He grabbed aimlessly with his hands at the wall and the wood-work behind him, still yelling at the pitch of his lungs.
<br> 
<br> “Pull me up, son of the devil, pull me up!” he screamed. “Would you murder me, then? Help, good people, help!”
<br> 
<br> “Do you want to come up, captain?” said the strong clear voice of the young man above him, speaking excellent French, but in an accent which fell strangely upon the ears of the crowd beneath.
<br> 
<br> “Yes, sacred name of God, yes!”
<br> 
<br> “Order off your men, then.”
<br> 
<br> “Away, you dolts, you imbeciles! Do you wish to see me dashed to pieces? Away, I say! Off with you!”
<br> 
<br> “That is better,” said the youth, when the soldiers had vanished from the window. He gave a tug at the dragoon’s leg as he spoke, which jerked him up so far that he could twist round and catch hold of the lower edge of the balcony. “How do you find yourself now?” he asked.
<br> 
<br> “Hold me, for heaven’s sake, hold me!”
<br> 
<br> “I have you quite secure.”
<br> 
<br> “Then pull me up!”
<br> 
<br> “Not so fast, captain. You can talk very well where you are.”
<br> 
<br> “Let me up, sir, let me up!”
<br> 
<br> “All in good time. I fear that it is inconvenient to you to talk with your heels in the air.”
<br> 
<br> “Ah, you would murder me!”
<br> 
<br> “On the contrary, I am going to pull you up.”
<br> 
<br> “Heaven bless you!”
<br> 
<br> “But only on conditions.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, they are granted! I am slipping!”
<br> 
<br> “You will leave this house—you and your men. You will not trouble this old man or this young girl any further. Do you promise?”
<br> 
<br> “Oh yes; we shall go.”
<br> 
<br> “Word of honour?”
<br> 
<br> “Certainly. Only pull me up!”
<br> 
<br> “Not so fast. It may be easier to talk to you like this. I do not know how the laws are over here. Maybe this sort of thing is not permitted. You will promise me that I shall have no trouble over the matter.”
<br> 
<br> “None, none. Only pull me up!”
<br> 
<br> “Very good. Come along!”
<br> 
<br> He dragged at the dragoon’s leg while the other gripped his way up the balustrade until, amid a buzz of congratulation from the crowd, he tumbled all in a heap over the rail on to the balcony, where he lay for a few moments as he had fallen. Then staggering to his feet, without a glance at his opponent, he rushed, with a bellow of rage, through the open window.
<br> 
<br> While this little drama had been enacted overhead, the young guardsman had shaken off his first stupor of amazement, and had pushed his way through the crowd with such vigour that he and his companion had nearly reached the bottom of the steps. The uniform of the king’s guard was in itself a passport anywhere, and the face of old Catinat was so well known in the district that everyone drew back to clear a path for him towards his house. The door was flung open for them, and an old servant stood wringing his hands in the dark passage.
<br> 
<br> “Oh, master! Oh, master!” he cried.
<br> 
<br> “Such doings, such infamy! They will murder him!”
<br> 
<br> “Whom, then?”
<br> 
<br> “This brave monsieur from America. Oh, my God, hark to them now!”
<br> 
<br> As he spoke, a clatter and shouting which had burst out again upstairs ended suddenly in a tremendous crash, with volleys of oaths and a prolonged bumping and smashing, which shook the old house to its foundations. The soldier and the Huguenot rushed swiftly up the first flight of stairs, and were about to ascend the second one, from the head of which the uproar seemed to proceed, when a great eight-day clock came hurtling down, springing four steps at a time, and ending with a leap across the landing and a crash against the wall, which left it a shattered heap of metal wheels and wooden splinters. An instant afterwards four men, so locked together that they formed but one rolling bundle, came thudding down amid a debris of splintered stair-rails, and writhed and struggled upon the landing, staggering up, falling down, and all breathing together like the wind in a chimney. So twisted and twined were they that it was hard to pick one from the other, save that the innermost was clad in black Flemish cloth, while the three who clung to him were soldiers of the king. Yet so strong and vigorous was the man whom they tried to hold that as often as he could find his feet he dragged them after him from end to end of the passage, as a boar might pull the curs which had fastened on to his haunches. An officer, who had rushed down at the heels of the brawlers, thrust his hands in to catch the civilian by the throat, but he whipped them back again with an oath as the man’s strong white teeth met in his left thumb. Clapping the wound to his mouth, he flashed out his sword and was about to drive it through the body of his unarmed opponent, when De Catinat sprang forward and caught him by the wrist.
<br> 
<br> “You villain, Dalbert!” he cried.
<br> 
<br> The sudden appearance of one of the king’s own bodyguard had a magic effect upon the brawlers. Dalbert sprang back, with his thumb still in his mouth, and his sword drooping, scowling darkly at the new-comer. His long sallow face was distorted with anger, and his small black eyes blazed with passion and with the hell-fire light of unsatisfied vengeance. His troopers had released their victim, and stood panting in a line, while the young man leaned against the wall, brushing the dust from his black coat, and looking from his rescuer to his antagonists.
<br> 
<br> “I had a little account to settle with you before, Dalbert,” said De Catinat, unsheathing his rapier.
<br> 
<br> “I am on the king’s errand,” snarled the other.
<br> 
<br> “No doubt. On guard, sir!”
<br> 
<br> “I am here on duty, I tell you!”
<br> 
<br> “Very good. Your sword, sir!”
<br> 
<br> “I have no quarrel with you.”
<br> 
<br> “No?” De Catinat stepped forward and struck him across the face with his open hand. “It seems to me that you have one now,” said he.
<br> 
<br> “Hell and furies!” screamed the captain. “To your arms, men! Hola, there, from above! Cut down this fellow, and seize your prisoner! Hola! In the king’s name!”
<br> 
<br> At his call a dozen more troopers came hurrying down the stairs, while the three upon the landing advanced upon their former antagonist. He slipped by them, however, and caught out of the old merchant’s hand the thick oak stick which he carried.
<br> 
<br> “I am with you, sir,” said he, taking his place beside the guardsman.
<br> 
<br> “Call off your canaille, and fight me like a gentleman,” cried De Catinat.
<br> 
<br> “A gentleman! Hark to the bourgeois Huguenot, whose family peddles cloth!”
<br> 
<br> “You coward! I will write liar on you with my sword-point!”
<br> 
<br> He sprang forward, and sent in a thrust which might have found its way to Dalbert’s heart had the heavy sabre of a dragoon not descended from the side and shorn his more delicate weapon short off close to the hilt. With a shout of triumph, his enemy sprang furiously upon him with his rapier shortened, but was met by a sharp blow from the cudgel of the young stranger which sent his weapon tinkling on to the ground. A trooper, however, on the stair had pulled out a pistol, and clapping it within a foot of the guardsman’s head, was about to settle the combat, once and forever, when a little old gentleman, who had quietly ascended from the street, and who had been looking on with an amused and interested smile at this fiery sequence of events, took a sudden step forward, and ordered all parties to drop their weapons with a voice so decided, so stern, and so full of authority, that the sabre points all clinked down together upon the parquet flooring as though it were a part of their daily drill.
<br> 
<br> “Upon my word, gentlemen, upon my word!” said he, looking sternly from one to the other. He was a very small, dapper man, as thin as a herring, with projecting teeth and a huge drooping many-curled wig, which cut off the line of his skinny neck and the slope of his narrow shoulders. His dress was a long overcoat of mouse-coloured velvet slashed with gold, beneath which were high leather boots, which, with his little gold-laced, three-cornered hat, gave a military tinge to his appearance. In his gait and bearing he had a dainty strut and backward cock of the head, which, taken with his sharp black eyes, his high thin features, and his assured manner, would impress a stranger with the feeling that this was a man of power. And, indeed, in France or out of it there were few to whom this man’s name was not familiar, for in all France the only figure which loomed up as large as that of the king was this very little gentleman who stood now, with gold snuff-box in one hand, and deep-laced handkerchief in the other, upon the landing of the Huguenot’s house. For who was there who did not know the last of the great French nobles, the bravest of French captains, the beloved Conde, victor of Recroy and hero of the Fronde? At the sight of his pinched, sallow face the dragoons and their leader had stood staring, while De Catinat raised the stump of his sword in a salute.
<br> 
<br> “Heh, heh!” cried the old soldier, peering at him.
<br> 
<br> “You were with me on the Rhine—heh? I know your face, captain. But the household was with Turenne.”
<br> 
<br> “I was in the regiment of Picardy, your Highness. De Catinat is my name.”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, yes. But you, sir, who the devil are you?”
<br> 
<br> “Captain Dalbert, your Highness, of the Languedoc Blue Dragoons.”
<br> 
<br> “Heh! I was passing in my carriage, and I saw you standing on your head in the air. The young man let you up on conditions, as I understood.”
<br> 
<br> “He swore he would go from the house,” cried the young stranger. “Yet when I had let him up, he set his men upon me, and we all came downstairs together.”
<br> 
<br> “My faith, you seem to have left little behind you,” said Conde, smiling, as he glanced at the litter which was strewed all over the floor. “And so you broke your parole, Captain Dalbert?”
<br> 
<br> “I could not hold treaty with a Huguenot and an enemy of the king,” said the dragoon sulkily.
<br> 
<br> “You could hold treaty, it appears, but not keep it. And why did you let him go, sir, when you had him at such a vantage?”
<br> 
<br> “I believed his promise.”
<br> 
<br> “You must be of a trusting nature.”
<br> 
<br> “I have been used to deal with Indians.”
<br> 
<br> “Heh! And you think an Indian’s word is better than that of an officer in the king’s dragoons?”
<br> 
<br> “I did not think so an hour ago.”
<br> 
<br> “Hem!” Conde took a large pinch of snuff, and brushed the wandering grains from his velvet coat with his handkerchief of point.
<br> 
<br> “You are very strong, monsieur,” said he, glancing keenly at the broad shoulders and arching chest of the young stranger. “You are from Canada, I presume?”
<br> 
<br> “I have been there, sir. But I am from New York.”
<br> 
<br> Conde shook his head. “An island?”
<br> 
<br> “No, sir; a town.”
<br> 
<br> “In what province?”
<br> 
<br> “The province of New York.”
<br> 
<br> “The chief town, then?”
<br> 
<br> “Nay; Albany is the chief town.”
<br> 
<br> “And how came you to speak French?”
<br> 
<br> “My mother was of French blood.”
<br> 
<br> “And how long have you been in Paris?”
<br> 
<br> “A day.”
<br> 
<br> “Heh! And you already begin to throw your mother’s country-folk out of windows!”
<br> 
<br> “He was annoying a young maid, sir, and I asked him to stop, whereon he whipped out his sword, and would have slain me had I not closed with him, upon which he called upon his fellows to aid him. To keep them off, I swore that I would drop him over if they moved a step. Yet when I let him go, they set upon me again, and I know not what the end might have been had this gentleman not stood my friend.”
<br> 
<br> “Hem! You did very well. You are young, but you have resource.”
<br> 
<br> “I was reared in the woods, sir.”
<br> 
<br> “If there are many of your kidney, you may give my friend De Frontenac some work ere he found this empire of which he talks. But how is this, Captain Dalbert? What have you to say?”
<br> 
<br> “The king’s orders, your Highness.”
<br> 
<br> “Heh! Did he order you to molest the girl? I have never yet heard that his Majesty erred by being too harsh with a woman.” He gave a little dry chuckle in his throat, and took another pinch of snuff.
<br> 
<br> “The orders are, your Highness, to use every means which may drive these people into the true Church.”
<br> 
<br> “On my word, you look a very fine apostle and a pretty champion for a holy cause,” said Conde, glancing sardonically out of his twinkling black eyes at the brutal face of the dragoon. “Take your men out of this, sir, and never venture to set your foot again across this threshold.”
<br> 
<br> “But the king’s command, your Highness.”
<br> 
<br> “I will tell the king when I see him that I left soldiers and that I find brigands. Not a word, sir! Away! You take your shame with you, and you leave your honour behind.” He had turned in an instant from the sneering, strutting old beau to the fierce soldier with set face and eye of fire. Dalbert shrank back from his baleful gaze, and muttering an order to his men, they filed off down the stair with clattering feet and clank of sabres.
<br> 
<br> “Your Highness,” said the old Huguenot, coming forward and throwing open one of the doors which led from the landing, “you have indeed been a saviour of Israel and a stumbling-block to the froward this day. Will you not deign to rest under my roof, and even to take a cup of wine ere you go onwards?”
<br> 
<br> Conde raised his thick eyebrows at the scriptural fashion of the merchant’s speech, but he bowed courteously to the invitation, and entered the chamber, looking around him in surprise and admiration at its magnificence. With its panelling of dark shining oak, its polished floor, its stately marble chimney-piece, and its beautifully moulded ceiling, it was indeed a room which might have graced a palace.
<br> 
<br> “My carriage waits below,” said he, “and I must not delay longer. It is not often that I leave my castle of Chantilly to come to Paris, and it was a fortunate chance which made me pass in time to be of service to honest men. When a house hangs out such a sign as an officer of dragoons with his heels in the air, it is hard to drive past without a question. But I fear that as long as you are a Huguenot, there will be no peace for you in France, monsieur.”
<br> 
<br> “The law is indeed heavy upon us.”
<br> 
<br> “And will be heavier if what I hear from court is correct. I wonder that you do not fly the country.”
<br> 
<br> “My business and my duty lie here.”
<br> 
<br> “Well, every man knows his own affairs best. Would it not be wise to bend to the storm, heh?”
<br> 
<br> The Huguenot gave a gesture of horror.
<br> 
<br> “Well, well, I meant no harm. And where is this fair maid who has been the cause of the broil?”
<br> 
<br> “Where is Adele, Pierre?” asked the merchant of the old servant, who had carried in the silver tray with a squat flask and tinted Venetian glasses.
<br> 
<br> “I locked her in my room, master.”
<br> 
<br> “And where is she now?”
<br> 
<br> “I am here, father.” The young girl sprang into the room, and threw her arms round the old merchant’s neck. “Oh, I trust these wicked men have not hurt you, love!”
<br> 
<br> “No, no, dear child; none of us have been hurt, thanks to his Highness the Prince of Conde here.”
<br> 
<br> Adele raised her eyes, and quickly drooped them again before the keen questioning gaze of the old soldier. “May God reward your Highness!” she stammered. In her confusion the blood rushed to her face, which was perfect in feature and expression. With her sweet delicate contour, her large gray eyes, and the sweep of the lustrous hair, setting off with its rich tint the little shell-like ears and the alabaster whiteness of the neck and throat, even Conde, who had seen all the beauties of three courts and of sixty years defile before him, stood staring in admiration at the Huguenot maiden.
<br> 
<br> “Heh! On my word, mademoiselle, you make me wish that I could wipe forty years from my account.” He bowed, and sighed in the fashion that was in vogue when Buckingham came to the wooing of Anne of Austria, and the dynasty of cardinals was at its height.
<br> 
<br> “France could ill spare those forty years, your Highness.”
<br> 
<br> “Heh, heh! So quick of tongue too? Your daughter has a courtly wit, monsieur.”
<br> 
<br> “God forbid, your Highness! She is as pure and good—”
<br> 
<br> “Nay, that is but a sorry compliment to the court. Surely, mademoiselle, you would love to go out into the great world, to hear sweet music, see all that is lovely, and wear all that is costly, rather than look out ever upon the Rue St. Martin, and bide in this great dark house until the roses wither upon your cheeks.”
<br> 
<br> “Where my father is, I am happy at his side,” said she, putting her two hands upon his sleeve. “I ask nothing more than I have got.”
<br> 
<br> “And I think it best that you go up to your room again,” said the old merchant shortly, for the prince, in spite of his age, bore an evil name among women. He had come close to her as he spoke, and had even placed one yellow hand upon her shrinking arm, while his little dark eyes twinkled with an ominous light.
<br> 
<br> “Tut, tut!” said he, as she hastened to obey. “You need not fear for your little dove. This hawk, at least, is far past the stoop, however tempting the quarry. But indeed, I can see that she is as good as she is fair, and one could not say more than that if she were from heaven direct. My carriage waits, gentlemen, and I wish you all a very good day!” He inclined his bewigged head, and strutted off in his dainty, dandified fashion. From the window De Catinat could see him slip into the same gilded chariot which had stood in his way as he drove from Versailles.
<br> 
<br> “By my faith,” said he, turning to the young American, “we all owe thanks to the prince, but it seems to me, sir, that we are your debtors even more. You have risked your life for my cousin, and but for your cudgel, Dalbert would have had his blade through me when he had me at a vantage. Your hand, sir! These are things which a man cannot forget.”
<br> 
<br> “Ay, you may well thank him, Amory,” broke in the old Huguenot, who had returned after escorting his illustrious guest to the carriage. “He has been raised up as a champion for the afflicted, and as a helper for those who are in need. An old man’s blessing upon you, Amos Green, for my own son could not have done for me more than you, a stranger.”
<br> 
<br> But their young visitor appeared to be more embarrassed by their thanks than by any of his preceding adventures. The blood flushed to his weather-tanned, clear-cut face, as smooth as that of a boy, and yet marked by a firmness of lip and a shrewdness in the keen blue eyes which spoke of a strong and self-reliant nature.
<br> 
<br> “I have a mother and two sisters over the water,” said he diffidently.
<br> 
<br> “And you honour women for their sake?”
<br> 
<br> “We always honour women over there. Perhaps it is that we have so few. Over in these old countries you have not learned what it is to be without them. I have been away up the lakes for furs, living for months on end the life of a savage among the wigwams of the Sacs and the Foxes, foul livers and foul talkers, ever squatting like toads around their fires. Then when I have come back to Albany where my folk then dwelt, and have heard my sisters play upon the spinet and sing, and my mother talk to us of the France of her younger days and of her childhood, and of all that they had suffered for what they thought was right, then I have felt what a good woman is, and how, like the sunshine, she draws out of one’s soul all that is purest and best.”
<br> 
<br> “Indeed, the ladies should be very much obliged to monsieur, who is as eloquent as he is brave,” said Adele Catinat, who, standing in the open door, had listened to the latter part of his remarks.
<br> 
<br> He had forgotten himself for the instant, and had spoken freely and with energy. At the sight of the girl, however, he coloured up again, and cast down his eyes.
<br> 
<br> “Much of my life has been spent in the woods,” said he, “and one speaks so little there that one comes to forget how to do it. It was for this that my father wished me to stay some time in France, for he would not have me grow up a mere trapper and trader.”
<br> 
<br> “And how long do you stop in Paris?” asked the guardsman.
<br> 
<br> “Until Ephraim Savage comes for me.”
<br> 
<br> “And who is he?”
<br> 
<br> “The master of the Golden Rod.”
<br> 
<br> “And that is your ship?”
<br> 
<br> “My father’s ship. She has been to Bristol, is now at Rouen, and then must go to Bristol again. When she comes back once more, Ephraim comes to Paris for me, and it will be time for me to go.”
<br> 
<br> “And how like you Paris?”
<br> 
<br> The young man smiled. “They told me ere I came that it was a very lively place, and truly from the little that I have seen this morning, I think that it is the liveliest place that I have seen.”
<br> 
<br> “By my faith,” said De Catinat, “you came down those stairs in a very lively fashion, four of you together with a Dutch clock as an avant-courier, and a whole train of wood-work at your heels. And you have not seen the city yet?”
<br> 
<br> “Only as I journeyed through it yester-evening on my way to this house. It is a wondrous place, but I was pent in for lack of air as I passed through it. New York is a great city. There are said to be as many as three thousand folk living there, and they say that they could send out four hundred fighting-men, though I can scarce bring myself to believe it. Yet from all parts of the city one may see something of God’s handiwork—the trees, the green of the grass, and the shine of the sun upon the bay and the rivers. But here it is stone and wood, and wood and stone, look where you will. In truth, you must be very hardy people to keep your health in such a place.”
<br> 
<br> “And to us it is you who seem so hardy, with your life in the forest and on the river,” cried the young girl. “And then the wonder that you can find your path through those great wildernesses, where there is naught to guide you.”
<br> 
<br> “Well, there again! I marvel how you can find your way among these thousands of houses. For myself, I trust that it will be a clear night to-night.”
<br> 
<br> “And why?”
<br> 
<br> “That I may see the stars.”
<br> 
<br> “But you will find no change in them.”
<br> 
<br> “That is it. If I can but see the stars, it will be easy for me to know how to walk when I would find this house again. In the daytime I can carry a knife and notch the door-posts as I pass, for it might be hard to pick up one’s trail again, with so many folk ever passing over it.”
<br> 
<br> De Catinat burst out laughing again. “By my faith, you will find Paris livelier than ever,” said he, “if you blaze your way through on the door-posts as you would on the trees of a forest. But perchance it would be as well that you should have a guide at first; so, if you have two horses ready in your stables, uncle, our friend and I might shortly ride back to Versailles together, for I have a spell of guard again before many hours are over. Then for some days he might bide with me there, if he will share a soldier’s quarters, and so see more than the Rue St. Martin can offer. How would that suit you, Monsieur Green?”
<br> 
<br> “I should be right glad to come out with you, if we may leave all here in safety.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, fear not for that,” said the Huguenot. “The order of the Prince of Conde will be as a shield and a buckler to us for many a day. I will order Pierre to saddle the horses.”
<br> 
<br> “And I must use the little time I have,” said the guardsman, as he turned away to where Adele waited for him in the window.
