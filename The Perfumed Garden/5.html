<br> 
<br> When such a man has a bout with a woman, he does not do her business with the vigour and in a manner to give her enjoyment. He lays himself down upon her without previous toying, he does not kiss her, nor twine himself round her, he does not bite her, nor suck her lips, nor tickle her.
<br> 
<br> He gets upon her before she has begun longing for pleasure, and then he introduces with infinite trouble a member soft and nerveless. Scarcely has he commenced when he is already done for; he makes one or two movements, and then sinks upon the woman’s breast to spend his sperm, and that is the most he can do. This done he withdraws his affair, and makes all haste to get down again from her.
<br> 
<br> Such a man — as was said by a writer — is quick in ejaculation and slow as to erection; after the trembling, which follows the ejaculation of the seed, his chest is heavy and his sides ache.
<br> 
<br> Qualities like those are no recommendations with women. Despicable also is the man who is false to his words; who does not fulfil the promise he has made; who never speaks without telling lies, and who conceals from his wife all his doings, except the adulterous exploits which he commits.
<br> 
<br> Women cannot esteem such men, as they cannot procure them any enjoyment.
<br> 
<br> It is said that a man of the name of Abbes, whose member was extremely small and slight, had a very corpulent wife, whom he could not contrive to satisfy in coition, so that she soon began to complain to her female friends about it.
<br> 
<br> This woman possessed a considerable fortune, whilst Abbes was very poor; and when he wanted anything, she was sure not to let him have what he wanted.
<br> 
<br> One day he went to see a wise man, and submitted his case to him.
<br> 
<br> The sage told him: “If you had a fine member you might dispose of her fortune. Do you not know that women’s religion is in their vulva’s? But I will prescribe you a remedy which will do away with your troubles.”
<br> 
<br> Abbes lost no time to make up the remedy according to the recipe of the wise man, and after he had used it his member grew to be long and thick. When his wife saw it in that state she was surprised, but it came still better when he made her feel in the matter of enjoyment quite another thing than she had been accustomed to experience; he began in fact to work her with his tool in a quite remarkable manner to such point that she rattled and sighed and sobbed and cried out during the operation.
<br> 
<br> As soon as the wife found in her husband such eminently good qualities she gave him her fortune, and placed her person and all she had at his disposal.
