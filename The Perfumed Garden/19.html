<br> 
<br> Know, O Vizir (God be good to you!), that this chapter which treats of the size of the virile member, is of the first importance both for men and women. For the men, because from a large and vigorous member there spring the affection and love of the women; for the women, because it is by such members that their amorous passions get appeased, and the greatest pleasure is procured for them. This is evident from the fact that many men, solely by reason of their insignificant member, are, as far as the coition is concerned, objects of aversion to the women, who likewise entertain the same sentiment with regard to those whose members are soft, nerveless, and relaxed. Their whole happiness consists in the use of robust and strong members.
<br> 
<br> A man, therefore, with a small member, who wants to make it grand or fortify it for the coitus, must rub it before the copulation with tepid water, until it gets red and extended by the blood flowing into it, in consequence of the heat; he must then anoint it with a mixture of honey and ginger, rubbing it in sedulously. Then let him join the woman; he will procure for her such pleasure that she objects to him getting off her again.
<br> 
<br> Another remedy consists in a compound made of a moderate quantity of pepper, lavender, galanga, and musk, reduced to powder, sifted and mixed up with honey and preserved ginger. The member, after having been first washed in warm water, is then vigorously rubbed with the mixture; it will then grow large and brawny, and afford to the woman a marvellous feeling of voluptuousness.
<br> 
<br> A third remedy is the following: wash the member in warm water until it becomes red, and enters into erection. Then take a piece of soft leather, upon which spread hot pitch, and envelop the member with it. It will not be long before the member raises its head, trembling with passion. The leather is to be left on until the pitch grows cold, and the member is again in a state of repose. This operation, several times repeated, will have the effect of making the member strong and thick.
<br> 
<br> A fourth remedy is based upon the use made of leeches, but only of such as live in water (sic). You put as many of them into a bottle as can be got in, and then fill it up with oil. Then expose the bottle to the sun, until the heat of the same has effected a complete mixture. Then, with the fluid thus obtained the member is to be rubbed several consecutive days, and it will, by being thus treated, become of a good size and of full dimensions.
<br> 
<br> For another procedure I will here note the use of an ass’s member. Procure one and boil it, together with onions and a large quantity of corn. With this dish feed fowls, which you eat afterwards. One can also macerate the ass’s verge with oil, and use the fluid thus obtained afterwards for anointing one’s member with, it, and drinking of it.
<br> 
<br> Another way is to bruise leeches with oil, and rub the verge with this ointment; or, if it is preferred, the leeches may be put into a bottle, and, thus enclosed, buried in a warm dunghill until they are dissolved into a coherent mass and form a sort of liniment, which is used for repeatedly anointing the member. The member is certain to greatly benefit by this.
<br> 
<br> One may likewise take rosin and wax, mixed with tubipore,199 asphodel,200 and cobbler’s glue,201 with which mixture rub the member, and the result will be that its dimensions will be enlarged.
<br> 
<br> The efficacy of all these remedies is well known, and I have tested them.
