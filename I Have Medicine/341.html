There was also the more frightening power of the sun attached to them. After those two arrows pierced through the origin flood dragon’s eyes, it only took a few moments for the eyes to be burned by this power. They were nearly turned to ashes!The origin flood dragon let out an agonizing shriek. Due to the pain, its entire body swooped down below and its dragon tail swung out with strength. Across the surface of the river, enormous waves that were three hundred meters tall were whipped up, and those innumerable streams of water created surging whirlpools!It was only a pity that, no matter how high the flood dragon whipped up the river water, it was incapable of diving under the river’s surface — This river had been sealed off by several Ascendant Realm powerhouses long ago. How could they allow it to escape?However, the origin flood dragon was under intense pain, and when it madly swung its tail, it still possessed incredible strength. These Ascendant Realm powerhouses couldn’t help becoming agitated from sensing this qi energy. Their chests ached somewhat as well. Although this power wasn’t able to injure these Ascendant Realm powerhouses, it also appeared that this flood dragon was already close to going berserk. Now, perhaps it was about to stake it all with one move!On the other side of the battlefield.The might of Tianheng’s arrows was truly formidable. Even Gu Zuo, who had watched Tianheng mature was astonished. Let alone the other people.Those numerous organizations spectating from far away saw Tianheng taking action. His body seemed to transform into a bright star, and his attitude was like that of a sun god. That shocking arrow technique left people’s minds with a surge of thoughts! All of a sudden, their hearts no longer had any doubts about this all-star prodigy — How could an ordinary person use such a stunning martial skill while at the Immortal Realm?!The other prodigies all felt cold in their hearts.This was…the power of an all-star prodigy?At this very moment, they couldn’t help inwardly calculating. If they were faced with this arrow, were they capable of withstanding it? One couldn’t look at how that origin flood dragon’s eyes were a weak point. Even if it was like this, an origin beast was still an origin beast. The defensive power of that pair of dragon eyes was also extremely frightening. Otherwise, when Bao Hong previously stabbed into them, they wouldn’t have healed so quickly.But now, that origin flood dragon had been genuinely blinded by the two arrows!The prodigies focused even more.Bao Hong had always been a straightforward person. Whenever his heart was unwilling, he would act on it. After seeing that Tianheng truly had the capital to back himself up, Bao Hong developed some admiration, and became much more content with his place.Qi Xuanao’s expression was calm and gentle. He still didn’t say much, but restraining fear slowly grew in his heart.Only Fan Meng cared even more about Tianheng’s matters. Even though he was also shaken by that arrow technique, he wasn’t willing to let Tianheng hog all of the glory.Hence, he simply said: “Prodigy Gongyi has already blinded the flood dragon’s eyes. We must pull together and work as one to attack that origin flood dragon’s vital parts and kill it!”Qi Xuanao and Bao Hong nodded their heads: “That’s right. This is the perfect moment to strike.”The Ice Phoenix Goddess also spoke: “I’ll use the Ice Phoenix Heavenly Dance’s most powerful skill to slightly freeze that origin flood dragon. Everyone, work together. Don’t miss this opportunity.”In a flash, these prodigies had already concluded their communication.Immediately following this, the Ice Phoenix Goddess danced in the void. Snow as soft as goose feathers instantly began falling. Every single snowflake drifted in different directions. A blanketing chill spread across the land.Numerous snowflakes fell onto the Black Sand River. In a split second, it was frozen solid, which allowed the river water to be further covered by ice and frost. This emitted an extremely intense cold.It wasn’t only the surface of the river. Every place that those snowflakes passed by was turned silvery-white. That origin flood dragon was naturally no exception.In just the blink of an eye, snow fell upon the flood dragon’s body, plating its scales in a layer of white. The origin flood dragon sensed the danger within the snow. Originally, it was in the middle of enduring the agony in its eyes, but at this moment, it promptly writhed its body and discharged its qi energy to shake off all of the surrounding snowflakes!However, it was also due to its blindness that it couldn’t perceive the descending snowflakes in time. When it sensed the cold and danger, the snowflakes had already fallen. No matter how much it shook, it was still somewhat late.One couldn’t focus on the fact that the flood dragon had been a step too late. The power of ice and cold had rapidly invaded through its scales. The flood dragon’s blood and flesh were oppressed by the ice and cold, and slowly became stiff and rigid…Although this rigidity didn’t completely freeze the origin flood dragon, this nevertheless impacted its movements. At this moment, the frenzied and vicious might it previously revealed was weakened.Taking advantage of this golden opportunity, the other couple of prodigies swiftly acted!Fan Meng took the lead. One would only hear him shouting in a loud voice: “A Fierce Beast Roars at the Sky!”Then, his hands spread out, extending towards the front. He made an abrupt pushing motion!At this moment, a sinister beast head rushed out of Fan Meng, and formed an enormous beast shadow. As this entity dashed straight towards the flood dragon’s body, its huge jaws widened, and its sharp teeth clamped down onto the flood dragon’s throat!— It only needed to bite this place, and forcefully grip that origin flood dragon’s vital part. This limited the flood dragon’s actions in fear of causing irreparable damage to itself.After that, it was Bao Hong who made the next move.His legs suddenly bent, and the soles of his feet pushed out! He immediately transformed into a human-shaped cannonball as he flew straight up. Then, like a shooting star, he abruptly smashed down!Both of his fists shot forward. The strength and qi energy of his entire body gathered into each punch. His body’s qi energy flared and boiled, causing his face to flush red. This was precisely caused by the qi and blood.The power of his whole body slammed downward right at the weak point at the back of the origin flood dragon’s head! Although it wasn’t effective when he previously struck its Tianling Acupoint, this attack was different. If someone observed carefully, they would see that his fists were wearing a pair of battle gloves. These things seemed ancient and unadorned, but they possessed an understated presence. These gloves could increase his strength several times over. Thus, as he smashed down, it was extremely powerful!Following this was Qi Xuanao.He didn’t spare any words, and only took out that great saber once more. Immediately after that, his figure flashed past, and appeared beneath that flood dragon’s body. He raised the great saber, whirled his waist, swung his muscular arms, and performed a ferocious, circular slash!The cutting edge of that saber followed the curvature of the origin flood dragon’s abdomen, and slashed out. Wherever the saber met scales, it was sonorous and resounding like metal scraping against metal. However, Qi Xuanao didn’t stop with this one move. He spun his vigorous form again. He was actually using a saber technique, and unleashed saber strikes again and again. Every saber mark struck one location!The last one to take the stage was Tianheng.Previously, his two arrows pierced the flood dragon’s eyes. Now, he put away the greatbow, and slowly stretched out his two palms.As for these palms, they were dyed with a bit of red.Tianheng’s comportment was still natural, graceful, and poised like the young master of an aristocratic family. Originally, his skin was a lustrous white, but at this moment, he was almost as white as jade. Compared to his palms, whose color and luster were gradually deepening, it seemed like his palms were welling up with a drop of blood. There was an incredibly strange sense of beauty.Immediately following this, Tianheng’s right hand stretched forward, and lightly made a grabbing gesture.In an instant, a scarlet-red storm swept out. In the sky, it suddenly formed a gigantic hand!The size of this hand was no less than a dozen meters in size. Its blood vessels were distinct, and it didn’t seem like it had been condensed from energy. Instead, it was like a real hand had descended from thin air to forcefully grab something!At this moment, the origin flood dragon’s long tail was captured by that hand!With the strength of that hand, it tightly clenched onto that tail. When that origin flood dragon was caught, it couldn’t move its tail anymore. Its entire body was in pain, and its head was dizzy. Meanwhile, its insides were chilled and constricted, and struggling was extremely difficult. This made it even more furious.It opened its jaws, and sprayed poisonous fluids. This jet of liquid burst forth, and everything fell into that great river, which dyed a large tract of the river’s waves pitch-black. However, this poisonous fluid couldn’t injure these prodigies in the least. Its eyes were blinded, and it was continuously wounded. No matter how berserk it became, its momentum was also gradually declining…However, although the origin flood dragon’s imposing aura was slowly diminishing, the internal qi of a rank one origin beast was quite deep. If these prodigies wanted to thoroughly kill it, they couldn’t pull their punches. After the flood dragon was enraged, it was waiting for something. Once the prodigies used up their internal qi, it might still have the chance to escape with its life!In this way, the battle unexpectedly entered another deadlock!Tianheng’s eyes faintly narrowed.His right hand closed once more. The huge, blood-red hand that clutched the flood dragon’s tail promptly tightened, too.A surge of bloody qi erupted within the hollow of the palm. Within that clenched hand, it seemed to be mixing with an indistinct, black light. A sickly-sweet stench assailed one’s nostrils.Sizzling noises were coming from the flood dragon’s tail. In the blink of an eye, mottled traces appeared on the originally bright and clean scales. Now, they looked like rusted sheets of iron. These scales no longer possessed formidable defensive capabilities!As for the reddish-black light, it extended up along the scales. The origin flood dragon unleashed an even more miserable roar, and struggled even more violently! Thread-like cracks appeared within the white snow on its body, and some qi energy broke through. Consequently, Qi Xuanao, who was underneath the flood dragon’s body, was jolted by that qi energy. He fell down for about a kilometer before flying back up shortly thereafter. He could sense that the flood dragon’s power was dwindling, which reduced the distance that he was swept away…Presently, the flood dragon knew that it would be useless even if they remained in a deadlock. Right now, it was afraid that it really wouldn’t be able to preserve its small life. Therefore, it stimulated all of its ferocity. It wanted to take these puny bugs down with it!As a result, the qi energy on its body abruptly rose several times over!All of a sudden, not only was the ice and snow that covered its body shaken off, even Fan Meng, Qi Xuanao, and Bao Hong, these people who were close to the flood dragon’s body, were blown away by that qi energy. They did their best to muster up enough strength, and they weren’t too badly wounded during this fierce and violent qi energy blast — But even though it was like this, they still suffered some internal injuries.At the flood dragon’s tail, that extremely powerful-looking, blood-red hand likewise developed hairline fractures along its clear, porcelain-like surface. If the origin flood dragon stimulated its strength once more, perhaps the gigantic blood hand holding its dragon tail in place would also collapse.Tianheng stood quite a distance away. At this moment, although the gale-force winds generated from the origin flood dragon’s qi energy blew against his robes and long hair, he was still stable and unruffled.The blood-red color on his palms didn’t wane. Right now, he slowly unfurled his fingers once more.This time, he extended his left hand. One would only see his left hand unhurriedly lifting up. After that, his palm flipped over, and abruptly pressed down!In a split second, a blood-red hand that was over a hundred meters wide appeared in the sky above the origin flood dragon. This time’s palm wasn’t as distinct as before, but for some reason, the bloody qi it produced was several times denser!This hand followed Tianheng’s previous movements. It flipped over, and brazenly pressed down!Howl—The origin flood dragon’s shriek rattled people’s eardrums with a reverberating echo! This unexpectedly wounded some spectating martial artists whose realms were comparatively low. Blood flowed out of their ears!There seemed to be the crisp sound of breaking bones underneath that howl. Between the torrential waves, the roars of the flood dragon were long, continuous, and filled with suffering. However, its enormous body was still clearly visible to everyone.The place where that blood-red hand pressed down on was that origin flood dragon’s lengthy dragon tail. At this moment, in coordination with the previous blood palm, the tail was twisted and wrung into a crooked shape until its bones broke and sinews snapped! Countless streams of bloody qi followed the grooves of the misshapen scales, and burrowed inside. Every invasion contaminated a range of several meters. The scales within that range became dull and dim. It was practically impossible to move them again…The origin flood dragon’s voice slowly weakened. Just a while ago, it had incited its ferocity, and ended up receiving another shocking blow. As for the qi energy it previously roused, how could it still act so boisterously?Qi Xuanao and the other prodigies naturally wouldn’t let this chance slip away. They swiftly flew over, and utilized their own methods at the same time!A Fierce Beast Devours the Sky!First Strike of the Cruel Bear!The Harsh Saber, Third Form!Dance of Ice, Ninth Heaven!These prodigies used the true ultimate knowledges they practiced. These were also one of the most powerful moves they could currently send out. These moves burst forth with terrifying strength, causing the hearts of the spectating martial artists and organizations in the rear to be overwhelmed with emotions. Their complexions couldn’t stop flushing with excitement.Yes. They had come from various places. Perhaps, they didn’t know about each prodigy’s skills, but there would always be someone who had seen prodigies or heard about their ultimate knowledges.However, such people had only seen one or two prodigies, or merely listened to hearsay. Now, all of these prodigies were taking action at the same time. How couldn’t this cause people’s hearts to surge and their horizons to broaden?These attacks fell upon the origin flood dragon’s body, and it could only let out an agonized groan. Because its defenses were corroded, it could no longer weather the majority of the attacks and protect itself.All of the attacks displayed tremendous abilities. The origin flood dragon’s throat was crushed, its skull was shattered, and its abdomen was sliced open with a long laceration, which caused its internal organs to tumble out. Countless skewers that were condensed from ice and snow penetrated those dull scales, making the origin flood dragon’s body look like a hedgehog.Lastly, a figure grasped a silver spear, and quivered the spear tip.In a split second, a current of horrifying power flooded out, and directly pierced that origin flood dragon’s heart!After letting out a final, unwilling, blood-curdling screech, the flood dragon’s enormous body thrashed violently. It swayed a few times before powerlessly falling onto the surface of the river, creating a gigantic splash.Numerous battle slaves uniformly acted, and used a huge net to catch it. The origin flood dragon didn’t have the least bit of breath remaining. Just like this, with a body covered in cuts and bruises, it died under the encirclement and onslaught of these prodigies!Soon after, the waves of the great river settled down.A number of silhouettes shot out, and landed along the riverbank.Their figures seemed far smaller than the corpse of the origin flood dragon on the river. However, as they stood there, no one dared to neglect them in the least.With their Immortal Realms, they slayed a rank one origin beast.Sure enough, the prowess of prodigies shocked the heavens and shook the earth. They were outstanding and extraordinary!Numerous spectating martial artists let out lengthy gasps of air. At this time, they discovered that they had long forgotten to breathe during the exciting battle just now…Gu Zuo, who was on the back of an enormous wild beast, slowly unclenched his fingers and sighed in relief.In the beginning, he could still calmly watch the battle, but as time passed, he watched with more and more focus. His mood also became apprehensive and nervous.Now, the matter had ended. The prodigies killed the origin flood dragon without a hitch, and his big brother’s impact during this battle couldn’t be ignored by anyone.Gu Zuo inwardly nodded his head.Undoubtedly, Tianheng’s performance was the best, and his power was the strongest!At this time, those arrogant and condescending prodigies wouldn’t dare to hold any veiled criticisms against his big brother, right?After sighing again, Gu Zuo’s line of sight couldn’t help falling onto the corpse of that origin flood dragon.Ah, an origin beast’s corpse… He hadn’t seen one before.He really wanted to dissect it, and harvest its medicinal ingredients.Just as he was thinking about it, Ao Ying suddenly appeared in front of Gu Zuo. In a respectful voice, he said: “Pharmacist Gu, the young master invites you to come over.”Gu Zuo stared blankly. Then, he swiftly inquired in his consciousness.[Big brother, you’re calling for me?]Tianheng’s reply quickly arrived.[Ah Zuo, come to my side.]Gu Zuo’s face warmed up. He turned his head to look at Ao Ying: “Okay.”Ao Ying immediately concealed himself once more.Under his command, the wild beast soon galloped forward. It rushed straight to the banks of the Black Sand River. Surrounding this wild beast were resounding footsteps. These belonged to the previously dismissed battle slaves who couldn’t approach the battlefield, and included the subordinates of the other prodigies. All of them promptly came over, and rendezvoused with the battle slaves who held the lines at the riverbanks.Once the enormous wild beast reached its destination, Gu Zuo walked a few steps to the side, and jumped down below!The space between his eyebrows slightly swelled with light, and his Core Psyche Realm’s psychic power rapidly discharged. It bundled up his body, and instantly allowed him to become as lithe as a swallow. He rode the winds and floated down.Not long after, he stood firmly on the ground.Tianheng waved his hand to Gu Zuo: “Ah Zuo, come here.”Gu Zuo subconsciously wore a smile, and swiftly scampered over: “Big brother.”Beside the other prodigies were also several men and women who had pure and mild qi emissions. They were similarly pharmacists, and their relationships with those prodigies seemed quite close.Qi Xuanao opened his mouth first: “Now that the origin flood dragon is dead, its physical body will be partitioned by us. The things inside its den will also be distributed by us. As for how everything will be divided… Brother Gongyi has made the biggest contributions during this trip, and he should obtain even more.”His words were reasonable, but since he took the initiative to speak, this was doubtlessly to express his goodwill to Tianheng.Bao Hong also said: “This is how it ought to be.”The Ice Phoenix Goddess lightly inclined her beautiful forehead: “Indeed. It should be like this.”Finally, that Fan Meng also spoke: “That’s right.”Although he still viewed Tianheng as a love rival, he saw things clearly during the previous battle. With his pride as a prodigy, he wouldn’t go so far as to make things difficult for Tianheng in this place. On the contrary, it would make himself seem crass.Tianheng naturally didn’t refuse: “In that case, many thanks, everyone.”Gu Zuo listened on the side, and was somewhat appreciative of these prodigies.In the past, he would hear that many people would fight each other with faces flushed in anger when plundering resources. Any agreed-upon distributions based on one’s merits were promises that couldn’t be kept. Where could negotiations be so peaceful like now?But when he thought about it again, he felt that this was very normal.After all, these were prodigies! Good things weren’t in short supply. Fighting over the benefits brought about by the origin beast certainly wouldn’t be proper. If this happened, it would truly be a loss of face!Hence, he inwardly nodded again.After this, Qi Xuanao and the other prodigies glanced at each other. It seemed that they were communicating something.Nevertheless, it was Qi Xuanao who spoke: “From what this Qi witnessed, Brother Gongyi’s contributions far exceed ours. It would be appropriate for his share to be twice our own. It’s just that this won’t be easily split up. Therefore, this Qi thinks that Brother Gongyi can take thirty percent of everything, and the remaining seventy percent can be further distributed between the four of us. Apart from this, Brother Gongyi gets first pick of the various treasures on the origin flood dragon’s physical body, and there will be no need to divide it between us. What does everyone think?”The Ice Phoenix Goddess and the other two prodigies nodded: “Okay.”Naturally, Tianheng also gave a faint smile: “Since it’s like this, this one won’t stand on ceremony.”Following that, it was time to disassemble the origin flood dragon’s physical body.Fan Meng said: “There are treasures all over an origin beasts’s body. We martial artists have rough hands and coarse feet. I’m afraid it’ll be hard to harvest anything. Thus, our subordinates can each send out a pharmacist to extract those elusive and inaccessible treasures. Afterwards, it’ll be allocated by us. How about that?”Having heard what was said, the group of prodigies didn’t object.Tianheng slightly inclined his body, and revealed an encouraging smile to Gu Zuo: “Go ahead, Ah Zuo.”Gu Zuo felt joy in his heart. He didn’t expect that Tianheng would really let him participate!After that, he looked at the others. Basically everyone was at the Core Psyche Realm. However, their internal qi realms were only somewhat higher than his own. Thus, not everyone had become profound-level pharmacists. As such, they were likewise being sent out by the prodigies to gain first-hand knowledge. Perhaps they were the prodigies’ personal pharmacists or candidates to become personal pharmacists?If it was like this, then he couldn’t lose out to them!The pharmacists of the other prodigies had probably experienced professional training, but Gu Zuo himself traversed an unorthodox path. There were many item books that he had gone through. His field of knowledge was vast, and he wasn’t lacking in strong points.As a result, Gu Zuo silently made a fist.— He certainly wouldn’t cause his big brother to lose face!Soon, Gu Zuo and several other pharmacists were ready and waiting.That gigantic origin flood dragon’s corpse had been dragged ashore by the battle slaves. When it wasn’t moving, the enormity of the flood dragon’s body seemed like a small mountain range. It emitted a faint suppressive might.Although the origin flood dragon had died, the realm it possessed while alive was still being exhibited. If some pharmacists with low realms came over, their legs would soften under this kind of suppressive might. To say nothing of hanging on the corpse to collect medicinal ingredients.However, Gu Zuo wasn’t afraid. His spiritual path realm was rather high, and he didn’t care about this bit of suppression.Currently, what he needed to do was to swiftly harvest any useful medicinal ingredients. He had to do his best to collect more than the others to give face to his big brother.After that, Gu Zuo breathed deeply, and took out a knife that emitted a faint, spiritual light.This was something that Tianheng had prepared for him in advance. It was a spirit weapon that was especially used for cutting the corpses of origin beasts. This spirit weapon didn’t have any attributes. When such tools were first refined, they were provided for the use of pharmacists. Now, they brought out the best in each other.Gu Zuo followed the winding flood dragon’s body, and arrived in front of a claw. He looked at the sharp talons, which flickered with a cold gleam, and his eyes shined.First, he would settle the larger chunks. Then, he would take care of the things that required delicate work…However, just when he was about to undertake his task, his expression turned a bit subtle.[Side Mission: Harvest the origin flood dragon’s physical body for medicinal ingredients. No fewer than five types.][Mission Items: One set of harvesting equipment.][Completion Method: Unrestricted.][Completion Time: One day.][Failure Penalty: None.]Gu Zuo’s reaction to the appearance of one more small chest in the Divine Medicine Palace Hall was to blink his eyes.Currently, he understood that all of the missions that the system gave him were things that he was about to do or matters that he could quickly accomplish. Their objectives were usually to give him item books or suitable objects… Basically, these were all free presents from beginning to end.How could it be compared to this time? Rather than saying that this was simply letting him complete a mission, it was better to say that it was only delivering him the harvesting tools — That mission requirement which stated “no fewer than five types” should be urging him not to be lazy.One needed to know that the categories of medicinal ingredients on this origin flood dragon weren’t fewer than five types.Gu Zuo composed himself, and his thoughts moved. That small chest appeared in front of him.When he opened it, he saw a flash of spiritual light. It was blinding.There really were many things inside.A small hatchet, pliers, gourds, long needles, surgical hooks… The variety was comprehensive. Anything that Gu Zuo could think of was right here.This was practically gifting a pillow to a drowsy person!Gu Zuo no longer hesitated. He placed the knife his big brother gave him inside the chest. Then, he turned to the small hatchet, and took it out.Soon after, he took several deep breaths. Gu Zuo faced the area that connected the flood dragon’s claw to its body, and chopped down with the hatchet!The pharmacists were bustling around.For such an enormous flood dragon body, it wasn’t easy to harvest its parts.Gu Zuo had selected a dragon claw. Although that spirit weapon hatchet was sharp, it still consumed a lot of energy.The origin flood dragon’s outer layers were very hard. Even though he checked to make sure he used his strength at the seams between scales, it was difficult to break apart the connective tissues that held everything together.He concentrated the qi energy within his body onto the hatchet, and used his psychic power to meticulously observe the places being cut open by the hatchet. Every movement of the hatchet was slowly adjusted, which allowed the wound at the incision site to deepen and widen… After persevering for a full hour, this flood dragon claw was stripped away in perfect condition. Once he severed it, he didn’t damage the tendons and muscles inside. He also didn’t cause any damage to the intact skin that covered the flood dragon’s body.After smoothly taking down one dragon claw, a battle slave came over and used a vessel to receive it. Without the slightest hesitation, Gu Zuo turned around and moved forward to another dragon claw. He started the harvesting process once again.Because he gained experience with the first attempt, Gu Zuo was much faster during the second one. Thus, Gu Zuo was already done in less than an hour. Immediately following that was the third and fourth claws. Each attempt was faster than the last.The origin flood dragon had a total of four claws, and all of them were smoothly collected by him!Gu Zuo wiped away his sweat, and heaved a sigh of relief.This was considered a successful harvest for one type of medicinal ingredient… Of course, he didn’t blindly harvest the flood dragon’s claws. Rather, it was because he had already decided on the second type of harvestable material.— The flood dragon’s scales.Once the dragon claws were sliced off, there were small cracks around the scales in the areas adjacent to the claws. He simply peeled off these scales along the cracks. It was much easier than randomly finding a place to start working.Harvesting the dragon scales was a delicate affair. This was because not every dragon scale was intact. Back when his big brother used the Blood Palm, the reddish-black blood poison had invaded and contaminated many scales, which harmed the origin flood dragon. It was just that these contaminated scales couldn’t be placed among the harvestable medicinal ingredients that were in good condition.Of course, Gu Zuo felt that, if the other prodigies didn’t want these discarded scales, he would still want them… His big brother’s blood poison was powerful. A flood dragon’s scales also possessed medicinal properties. Who knew what kind of effect it would have once both sides combined? He wanted to test them.While thinking such things, the movements of Gu Zuo’s hands never once faltered.He swiftly took out the knife, and started to flawlessly peel away the scales one at a time.The intact scales were set on one side, and the scales contaminated with blood poison were placed on the other side… Without realizing it, Gu Zuo started climbing up as he descaled the corpse. When he dropped back down, he had a huge pile of scales.The jet-black flood dragon skin inside was also revealed.Merely, some of the dragon skin’s surfaces were also contaminated with blood poison. In other people’s opinions, these sections of skin were also going to be abandoned…Gu Zuo rubbed his shoulders, and prepared to continue.With so many flood dragon scales taken, the second type of medicinal ingredient was settled. As such, he would subsequently take the flood dragon’s skin — En, as well as its blood.Previously, the wounds that caused the origin flood dragon’s death had long been frozen by the Ice Phoenix Goddess’ ice and frost. This also completely preserved the blood within its body. However, after he sliced open the skin, its blood would obviously flow out.After that, Gu Zuo held the knife in one hand, while his other hand took out that gourd.Just then, he noticed that the gourd was specially used for storing blood. The internal volume was dozens of cubic meters. If nothing else, the blood that flowed out of one or two wounds definitely wouldn’t be able to fill it — At worst, after he extracted several rounds of blood, he would send the dragon blood within the gourd into the sky to be collected by the battle slaves.The flood dragon’s skin was sliced open. Gu Zuo separated the good skin from the spoiled skin, and he cut them into large sheets as much as possible. At the same time, once any skin was sliced, the flowing blood would be rapidly sucked dry by that gourd. What remained was pure dragon muscle. While there was also blood contained within the muscles, it didn’t flow easily.Just like this, the flood dragon’s skin and blood made up two types of medicinal ingredients.Once these were harvested, Gu Zuo took out a surgical hook, and began lifting the muscles and sinews within the flood dragon’s body. Each and every blood vessel was distinct. Utilizing various tools, he did his best to keep every single strand of muscle intact and undamaged.He worked enthusiastically, and every movement was practiced and unhindered. He was as smooth as floating clouds and flowing water.Slowly, the fifth type of medicinal ingredient, the flood dragon’s many muscles, was taken by Gu Zuo.However, Gu Zuo wasn’t content with only this. He continued his operations along the flood dragon’s body, and fully concentrated on harvesting the medicinal ingredients. He worked with the other pharmacists to partition these ingredients. Their faces all revealed satisfied expressions.In the vicinity of the flood dragon’s body.The prodigies stood calmly, but they weren’t only standing there.They instructed the Ascendant Realm battle slaves to remove the seal on the river’s surface, and sent these battle slaves to dive to the bottom of the river. That origin flood dragon’s old lair would be plundered, and everything inside would be extracted.As before, the remaining battle slaves stood near the great river. While they didn’t use any sealing techniques, they guarded the area, and didn’t allow anyone to fish in troubled waters.Because the origin flood dragon was already dead, the spectating organizations and martial artists who were originally far away had stepped forward one after another to get a full view of the flood dragon. They also looked somewhat covetously at those pharmacists who were harvesting the corpse.Pile after pile of medicinal ingredients were resolved. On the ground, they practically accumulated into numerous, small mountains. This caused feelings of admiration and envy to arise within these people.Ah, an origin beast…Even if it were the members of organizations, it would cost a lot to exchange for the things on an origin beast’s body. Not to mention the people who weren’t part of any organizations. With their realms, it was basically impossible to hunt and kill an origin beast. If it was purchased in the outside world, the prices were deathly expensive.What an origin beast represented was tremendous wealth and riches!Most of all, this fortune was still piling up before their very eyes — As for those prodigies, their expressions were calm and composed as before.Later on, the battle slaves continuously brought out the things inside the origin flood dragon’s underwater lair, and set everything in a pile. Although the flood dragon had only recently advanced, once it evolved, it had acted willfully and recklessly within the great river, and accumulated many treasures. After that, it caused havoc above the river, and seized even more good things. All of it was amassed within its old lair.Now, after moving these things out, everyone could see clearly. There were even spirit weapons and many rare and wondrous treasures. While their ranks weren’t extremely high, the sheer number of goods couldn’t be looked down upon.It was a huge fortune…Time slowly passed.The pharmacists were working nonstop. In the end, they progressively harvested as many medicinal ingredients as they could gather. Even the flood dragon’s head and abdomen were cut open, and the things inside were extracted.At this moment, the only thing that remained was a corpse with its skin peeled away. It was just a skeleton and some of its muscles with meat essence attached to its surfaces. At first glance, it was surprisingly in good condition, and still presented the shape of a flood dragon. People couldn’t help exclaiming in admiration for the exquisite skills of those pharmacists. Unexpectedly, they could achieve a dissection to such a degree.The flood dragon’s skin, scales, muscles, and so on were piled up like mountains. The flood dragon’s blood, claws, heart, brain, and other organs were placed in different vessels. They were exuding a rich and heavy bloody qi.Gongyi Tianheng smiled at the other prodigies: “The meat essence on the flood dragon’s corpse has been preserved. It can be taken down by the battle slaves. This will also expose the the flood dragon’s bones.”The group of prodigies heard this, and commanded their subordinates: “All of you, go quickly.”Tianheng gestured to Ao Min, who was next to him. The Ascendant Realm mastiff brought along over a hundred battle slaves, and went to cut apart the flood dragon’s flesh.Afterwards, Gu Zuo couldn’t hold back, and asked within his consciousness.[Big brother, how was my performance? Was I outdone by them?]Just then, he had been too earnest. It was to the point that he didn’t pay attention to whether he did a good job or not.Tianheng beamed.[Ah Zuo did extremely well. You didn’t lose out to the other pharmacists, and you even did better than several people. All of the numerous medicinal ingredients are intact, and there are almost no mistakes. The other prodigies are rather envious of your elder brother.]Gu Zuo’s face slightly reddened after being praised.He knew it was impossible for the other prodigies to feel envy, but when he was praised by his big brother, this already made him very, very happy.[I didn’t make big brother lose face?]Tianheng’s gaze softened.[You gave this elder brother a lot of face.]More time passed. All of the flood dragon’s flesh was cut down by the battle slaves. What remained was a skeleton. Apart from the tail section, which had been bent out of shape, this flood dragon skeleton was quite intact.Presently, the entire harvest had concluded. Following this was the true distribution of the spoils of war.Gongyi Tianheng was given the rights to choose first.He pretended to ponder somewhat, and walked in front of a jade box.Contained within this box was water from the Black Sand River. And soaking within the water was a pair of pearls. Each pearl was approximately the size of a clenched fist.They were the dragon eyes that were previously pierced by Tianheng’s arrows. Because they were burned by the power of the sun, the majority of each dragon eye was damaged. The remaining pieces were carefully extracted. These were the most important parts of the dragon eyes, but they also weren’t as precious as the original pair.Tianheng smiled and said: “I’ll be taking these things!”Having heard what was said, the expressions of the other prodigies slightly shifted.He ended up taking those things? Its worth clearly wasn’t the highest…The group of prodigies didn’t say much. However, they all took the same action without any prior arrangements. During the subsequent allocations, each of them uniformly handed over an extra one or two percent of their own gains to Tianheng.Because the prodigies didn’t argue over the benefits and only took what was necessary, the exchange went smoothly. Therefore, all of the spoils of war were divided cleanly within an hour.T/N: Happy New Year!Please don’t forget to support the original author.</p> </div> </div> <div class="row turn-page"> <a class="col-xs-2" href="/I%20Have%20Medicine/340.html?v=1662298959525">Previous</a> <a class="col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:center;" href="/I%20Have%20Medicine/book.html?v=1662298959524">Table</a> <a class="col-xs-2 col-xs-offset-2" style="text-align:right;" href="/I%20Have%20Medicine/342.html?v=1662298959527"> Next</a> </div> <hr></div><hr><footer class="container"> <p>© Company 2014</p></footer><amp-lightbox id="searchLightbox" class="-il" layout="nodisplay" on="lightboxOpen:searchInput.focus; lightboxClose:searchTriggerOpen.focus" scrollable="" hidden="hidden"> <div> <div class="-ic" role="button" tabindex="0" on="tap:searchLightbox.close"></div> <div class="-ih"> <div class="-sg -sb" on="tap: searchLightbox.close, AMP.setState({ query: '' }), searchForm.clear" role="button" tabindex="0"> <div class="ap-a-ico -sw"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#close"></use> </svg> </div> </div> <div class="ap-o-search-field"> <form action="#" action-xhr="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/echo" class="-ip" id="searchForm" on="submit:AMP.setState({ query: throttledValue }),searchResult.focus" target="_top"> <amp-autocomplete class="-id" filter="substring" min-characters="1" on="select:AMP.setState({ query: event.value })" submit-on-enter="false" src="https://api.xtestw.com/v1/search/autosuggest"> <div class="ap-a-ico -im"> <svg> <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#search"></use> </svg> </div> <input id="searchInput" class="-iv" name="q" placeholder="What are you looking for?" on="input-throttled:AMP.setState({ throttledValue: event.value })" required=""> <button class="-ig" type="submit" name="search-submit" disabled="" [disabled]="!throttledValue">Search </button> <div role="listbox"></div> </amp-autocomplete> </form> <div class="empty" [class]="query ?
