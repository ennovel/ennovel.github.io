She felt as soldiers sometimesfeel who know the enemy is undermining them; no danger on thesurface; nothing that can be seen, met, baffled, attacked, orevaded; in daily peril, all the more horrible that it imitatesperfect serenity, they await the fatal match. She imparted hermisgivings to Aubertin; but he assured her she exaggerated thedanger.</p> 
<p>　　"We have a friend still more zealous and active than our enemy;believe me, your depression is really caused by his absence; we allmiss the contact of that young heroic spirit; we are a body, and heits soul."Josephine was silent, for she said to herself, "Why should I dashtheir spirits? they are so happy and confident."Edouard had animated Rose and Aubertin with his own courage, and hadeven revived the baroness.</p> 
<p>　　It had been agreed between him and Picard that the latter shouldcommunicate with Dr. Aubertin direct, should anything fresh occur.</p> 
<p>　　And on the third day after Edouard's departure, Picard sent up aprivate message: "Perrin has just sent me a line to say he will nottrouble us, as he is offered the money in another quarter."This was a heavy blow, and sent them all to bed more or lessdespondent.</p> 
<p>　　The next day brought a long letter from Edouard to Rose, telling herhe had found his uncle crusty at first; but at last with a littlepatience, and the co-operation of Martha, his uncle's old servant,and his nurse, the old boy had come round. They might look on theaffair as all but settled.</p> 
<p>　　The contents of this letter were conveyed to the baroness. Thehouse brightened under it: the more so that there was some hope oftheir successful champion returning in person next day. MeantimePerrin had applied to Raynal for the immediate loan of a large sumof money on excellent security. Raynal refused plump. Perrin rodeaway disconsolate.</p> 
<p>　　But the next day he returned to the charge with another proposal:</p> 
<p>　　and the nature of this second proposal we shall learn from events.</p> 
<p>　　The day Edouard was expected opened deliciously. It was a balmymorning, and tempted the sisters out before breakfast. Theystrolled on the south terrace with their arms round each other'swaists, talking about Edouard, and wondering whether they shouldreally see him before night. Rose owned she had missed him, andconfessed for the first time she was a proud and happy girl.</p> 
<p>　　"May I tell him so?" asked Josephine.</p> 
<p>　　"Not for all the world. Would you dare?"Further discussion of that nice point was stopped by the baronesscoming out, leaning on Dr. Aubertin.</p> 
<p>　　Then--how we young people of an unceremonious age should havestared--the demoiselles de Beaurepaire, inasmuch as this was theirmother's first appearance, lowered their fair heads at the same timelike young poplars bowing to the wind, and so waited reverently tillshe had slightly lifted her hands, and said, "God bless you, mychildren!"It was done in a moment on both sides, but full of grace and piety,and the charm of ancient manners.</p> 
<p>　　"How did our dear mother sleep?" inquired Josephine. Aubertininterposed with a theory that she slept very well indeed if she tookwhat he gave her.</p> 
<p>　　"Ay, IF," suggested Rose, saucily.</p> 
<p>　　"I slept," said the baroness, "and I wish I had not for I dreamed anugly dream." They all gathered round her, and she told her dream.</p> 
<p>　　"I thought I was with you all in this garden. I was admiring theflowers and the trees, and the birds were singing with all theirmight. Suddenly a dark cloud came; it cleared almost directly; butflowers, trees, sky, and birds were gone now, and I could see thechateau itself no more. It means that I was dead. An ugly dream,my children, an ugly dream.""But only a dream, dear mother," said Rose: then with a sweet,consoling smile, "See, here is your terrace and your chateau.""And here are your daughters," said Josephine; and they both cameand kissed her to put their existence out of doubt. "And here isyour Aesculapius," said Aubertin. "And here is your Jacintha.""Breakfast, madame," said Jacintha. "Breakfast, mesdemoiselles.</p> 
<p>　　Breakfast, monsieur:" dropping each a distinct courtesy in turn.</p> 
<p>　　"She has turned the conversation very agreeably," said the baroness,and went in leaning on her old friend.</p> 
<p>　　But the sisters lagged behind and took several turns in silence.</p> 
<p>　　Rose was the first to speak. "How superstitious of you!""I said nothing.""No; but you looked volumes at me while mamma was telling her dream.</p> 
<p>　　For my part I feel sure love is stronger than hate; and we shallstay all our days in this sweet place: and O Josey! am I not a happygirl that it's all owing to HIM!"At this moment Jacintha came running towards them. They took it fora summons to breakfast, and moved to meet her. But they soon sawshe was almost as white as her apron, and she came open-mouthed andwringing her hands. "What shall I do? what shall I do? Oh, don'tlet my poor mistress know!"They soon got from her that Dard had just come from the town, andlearned the chateau was sold, and the proprietor coming to takepossession this very day. The poor girls were stupefied by theblow.</p> 
<p>　　If anything, Josephine felt it worst. "It is my doing," she gasped,and tottered fainting. Rose supported her: she shook it off by aviolent effort. "This is no time for weakness," she cried, wildly;"come to the Pleasaunce; there is water there. I love my mother.</p> 
<p>　　What will I not do for her? I love my mother."Muttering thus wildly she made for the pond in the Pleasaunce. Shehad no sooner turned the angle of the chateau than she started backwith a convulsive cry, and her momentary feebleness left herdirectly; she crouched against the wall and griped the ancientcorner-stone with her tender hand till it powdered, and she spiedwith dilating eye into the Pleasaunce, Rose and Jacintha pantingbehind her. Two men stood with their backs turned to her looking atthe oak-tree; one an officer in full uniform, the other the humansnake Perrin. Though the soldier's back was turned, his off-handed,peremptory manner told her he was inspecting the place as its master.</p> 
<p>　　"The baroness! the baroness!" cried Jacintha, with horror. Theylooked round, and the baroness was at their very backs.</p> 
<p>　　"What is it?" cried she, gayly.</p> 
<p>　　"Nothing, mamma.""Let me see this nothing."They glanced at one another, and, idle as the attempt was, the habitof sparing her prevailed, and they flung themselves between her andthe blow.</p> 
<p>　　"Josephine is not well," said Rose. "She wants to go in." Bothgirls faced the baroness.</p> 
<p>　　"Jacintha," said the baroness, "fetch Dr. Aubertin. There, I havesent her away. So now tell me, why do you drive me back so?</p> 
<p>　　Something has happened," and she looked keenly from one to theother.</p> 
<p>　　"O mamma! do not go that way: there are strangers in the Pleasaunce.""Let me see. So there are. Call Jacintha back that I may orderthese people out of my premises." Josephine implored her to becalm.</p> 
<p>　　"Be calm when impertinent intruders come into my garden?""Mother, they are not intruders.""What do you mean?""They have a right to be in our Pleasaunce. They have bought thechateau.""It is impossible. HE was to buy it for us--there is some mistake--what man would kill a poor old woman like me? I will speak to thisgentleman: he wears a sword. Soldiers do not trample on women. Ah!</p> 
<p>　　that man."The notary, attracted by her voice, was coming towards her, a paperin his hand.</p> 
<p>　　Raynal coolly inspected the tree, and tapped it with his scabbard,and left Perrin to do the dirty work. The notary took off his hat,and, with a malignant affectation of respect, presented the baronesswith a paper.</p> 
<p>　　The poor old thing took it with a courtesy, the effect of habit, andread it to her daughters as well as her emotion permitted, and thelanguage, which was as new to her as the dialect of Cat Island toColumbus.</p> 
<p>　　"Jean Raynal, domiciled by right, and lodging in fact at the Chateauof Beaurepaire, acting by the pursuit and diligence of MasterPerrin, notary; I, Guillaume Le Gras, bailiff, give notice toJosephine Aglae St. Croix de Beaurepaire, commonly called theBaroness de Beaurepaire, having no known place of abode"--"Oh!""but lodging wrongfully at the said Chateau of Beaurepaire, that sheis warned to decamp within twenty-four hours"--"To decamp!""failing which that she will be thereto enforced in the manner forthat case made and provided with the aid of all the officers andagents of the public force.""Ah! no, messieurs, pray do not use force. I am frightened enoughalready. I did not know I was doing anything wrong. I have beenhere thirty years. But, since Beaurepaire is sold, I comprehendperfectly that I must go. It is just. As you say, I am not in myown house. I will go, gentlemen, I will go. Whither shall I go, mychildren? The house where you were born to me is ours no longer.</p> 
<p>　　Excuse me, gentlemen--this is nothing to you. Ah! sir, you haverevenged yourself on two weak women--may Heaven forgive you!"The notary turned on his heel. The poor baroness, all whose pridethe iron law, with its iron gripe, had crushed into dismay andterror, appealed to him. "O sir! send me from the house, but notfrom the soil where my Henri is laid! is there not in all thisdomain a corner where she who was its mistress may lie down and die?</p> 
<p>　　Where is the NEW BARON, that I may ask this favor of him on myknees?"She turned towards Raynal and seemed to be going towards him withoutstretched arms. But Rose checked her with fervor. "Mamma! donot lower yourself. Ask nothing of these wretches. Let us loseall, but not forget ourselves."The baroness had not her daughter's spirit. Her very persontottered under this blow. Josephine supported her, and the nextmoment Aubertin came out and hastened to her side. Her head fellback; what little strength she had failed her; she was half lifted,half led, into the house.</p> 
<p>　　Commandant Raynal was amazed at all this, and asked what the deucewas the matter.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh!" said the notary, "we are used to these little scenes in ourbusiness.""But I am not," replied the soldier. "You never told me there wasto be all this fuss."He then dismissed his friend rather abruptly and strode up and downthe Pleasaunce. He twisted his mustaches, muttered, and "pested,"and was ill at ease. Accustomed to march gayly into a town, and seethe regiment, that was there before, marching gayly out, or viceversa, and to strike tents twice a quarter at least, he was littleprepared for such a scene as this. True, he did not hear all thebaroness's words, but more than one tone of sharp distress reachedhim where he stood, and the action of the whole scene was soexpressive, there was little need of words. He saw the noticegiven; the dismay it caused, and the old lady turn imploringlytowards him with a speaking gesture, and above all he saw hercarried away, half fainting, her hands clasped, her reverend facepale. He was not a man of quick sensibilities. He did notthoroughly take the scene in at first: it grew upon him afterwards.</p> 
<p>　　"Confound it," thought he, "I am the proprietor. They all say so.</p> 
<p>　　Instead of which I feel like a thief. Fancy her getting so fond ofa PLACE as all this."Presently it occurred to him that the shortness of the notice mighthave much to do with her distress. "These notaries," said he tohimself, "understand nothing save law: women have piles of baggage,and can't strike tents directly the order comes, as we can. Perhapsif I were to give them twenty-four days instead of hours?--hum!"With this the commandant fell into a brown study. Now each of ushas his attitude of brown study. One runs about the room like hyenain his den; another stands stately with folded arms (this one seldomthinks to the purpose); another sits cross-legged, brows lowered:</p> 
<p>　　another must put his head into his hand, and so keep it up tothinking mark: another must twiddle a bit of string, or a key; granthim this, he can hatch an epic. This commandant must draw himselfup very straight, and walk six paces and back very slowly, till theproblem was solved: I suspect he had done a good bit of sentinelwork in his time.</p> 
<p>　　Now whilst he was guarding the old oak-tree, for all the world as ifit had been the gate of the Tuileries or the barracks, Josephine deBeaurepaire came suddenly out from the house and crossed thePleasaunce: her hair was in disorder, her manner wild: she passedswiftly into the park.</p> 
<p>　　Raynal recognized her as one of the family; and after a moment'sreflection followed her into the park with the good-naturedintention of offering her a month to clear out instead of a day.</p> 
<p>　　But it was not so easy to catch her: she flew. He had to take hisscabbard in his left hand and fairly run after her. Before he couldcatch her, she entered the little chapel. He came up and had hisfoot on the very step to go in, when he was arrested by that heheard within.</p> 
<p>　　Josephine had thrown herself on her knees and was praying aloud:</p> 
<p>　　praying to the Virgin with sighs and sobs and all her soul:</p> 
<p>　　wrestling so in prayer with a dead saint as by a strange perversitymen cannot or will not wrestle with Him, who alone can hear amillion prayers at once from a million different places,--canrealize and be touched with a sense of all man's infirmities in away no single saint with his partial experience of them can realizeand be touched by them; who unasked suspended the laws of naturethat had taken a stranger's only son, and she a widow; and wept atanother great human sorrow, while the eyes of all the great saintsthat stood around it and Him were dry.</p> 
<p>　　Well, the soldier stood, his right foot on the step and his sword inhis left hand, transfixed: listening gravely to the agony of prayerthe innocent young creature poured forth within:--"O Madonna! hear me: it is for my mother's life. She will die--shewill die. You know she cannot live if she is taken away from herhouse and from this holy place where she prays to you this manyyears. O Queen of Heaven! put out your hand to us unfortunates!</p> 
<p>　　Virgin, hear a virgin: mother, listen to a child who prays for hermother's life! The doctor says she will not live away from here.</p> 
<p>　　She is too old to wander over the world. Let them drive us forth:</p> 
<p>　　we are young, but not her, mother, oh, not her! Forgive the cruelmen that do this thing!--they are like those who crucified your Son--they know not what they are doing. But you, Queen of Heaven, youknow all; and, sweet mother, if you have kind sentiments towards me,poor Josephine, ah! show them now: for you know that it was I whoinsulted that wicked notary, and it is out of hatred to me he hassold our beloved house to a hard stranger. Look down on me, a childwho loves her mother, yet will destroy her unless you pity me andhelp me. Oh! what shall I say?--what shall I do? mercy! mercy! formy poor mother, for me!"Here her utterance was broken by sobs.</p> 
<p>　　The soldier withdrew his foot quietly. Her words had knockedagainst his very breast-bone. He marched slowly to and fro beforethe chapel, upright as a dart, and stiff as a ramrod, and actuallypale: for even our nerves have their habits; a woman's passionategrief shook him as a cannon fired over his head could not.</p> 
<p>　　Josephine little thought who was her sentinel. She came to the doorat last, and there he was marching backwards and forwards, uprightand stiff. She gave a faint scream and drew back with a shudder atthe sight of their persecutor. She even felt faintish at him, aswomen will in such cases.</p> 
<p>　　Not being very quick at interpreting emotion, Raynal noticed heralarm, but not her repugnance; he saluted her with militaryprecision by touching his cap as only a soldier can, and said rathergently for him, "A word with you, mademoiselle."She replied only by trembling.</p> 
<p>　　"Don't be frightened," said Raynal, in a tone not very reassuring.</p> 
<p>　　"I propose an armistice.""I am at your disposal, sir," said Josephine, now assuming acalmness that was belied by the long swell of her heaving bosom.</p> 
<p>　　"Of course you look on me as an enemy.""How can I do otherwise, sir? yet perhaps I ought not. You did notknow us. You just wanted an estate, I suppose--and--oh!""Well, don't cry; and let us come to the point, since I am a man offew words.""If you please, sir. My mother may miss me.""Well, I was in position on your flank when the notary delivered hisfire. And I saw the old woman's distress.""Ah, sir!""When you came flying out I followed to say a good word to you. Icould not catch you. I listened while you prayed to the Virgin.</p> 
<p>　　That was not a soldier-like trick, you will say. I confess it.""It matters little, sir, and you heard nothing I blush for.""No! by St. Denis; quite the contrary. Well, to the point. Younglady, you love your mother.""What has she on earth now but her children's love?""Now look here, young lady, I had a mother; I loved her in myhumdrum way very dearly. She promised me faithfully not to die tillI should be a colonel; and she went and died before I was acommandant, even; just before, too.""Then I pity you," murmured Josephine; and her soft purple eye beganto dwell on him with less repugnance.</p> 
<p>　　"Thank you for that word, my good young lady," said Raynal. "Now, Ideclare, you are the first that has said that word to me about mylosing the true friend, that nursed me on her knee, and pinched andpinched to make a man of me. I should like to tell you about herand me.""I shall feel honored," said Josephine, politely, but withconsiderable restraint.</p> 
<p>　　Then he told her all about how he had vexed her when he was a boy,and gone for a soldier, though she was all for trade, and how he hadbeen the more anxious to see her enjoy his honors and success.</p> 
<p>　　"And, mademoiselle," said he, appealingly, "the day this epaulet wasput on my shoulder in Italy, she died in Paris. Ah! how could youhave the heart to do that, my old woman?"The soldier's mustache quivered, and he turned away brusquely, andtook several steps. Then he came back to Josephine, and to hisinfinite surprise saw that her purple eyes were thick with tears.</p> 
<p>　　"What? you are within an inch of crying for my mother, you who haveyour own trouble at this hour.""Monsieur, our situations are so alike, I may well spare some littlesympathy for your misfortune.""Thank you, my good young lady. Well, then, to business; while youwere praying to the Virgin, I was saying a word or two for my partto her who is no more.""Sir!""Oh! it was nothing beautiful like the things you said to the other.</p> 
<p>　　Can I turn phrases? I saw her behind her little counter in the RueQuincampoix; for she is a woman of the people, is my mother. I sawmyself come to the other side of the counter, and I said, 'Lookhere, mother, here is the devil to pay about this new house. Theold woman talks of dying if we take her from her home, and the youngone weeps and prays to all the saints in paradise; what shall we do,eh?' Then I thought my old woman said to me, 'Jean, you are asoldier, a sort of vagabond; what do you want with a house inFrance? you who are always in a tent in Italy or Austria, or whoknows where. Have you the courage to give honest folk so much painfor a caprice? Come now,' says she, 'the lady is of my age, sayyou, and I can't keep your fine house, because God has willed itotherwise; so give her my place; so then you can fancy it is me youhave set down at your hearth: that will warm your heart up a bit,you little scamp,' said my old woman in her rough way. She was notwell-bred like you, mademoiselle. A woman of the people, nothingmore.""She was a woman of God's own making, if she was like that," criedJosephine, the tears now running down her cheeks.</p> 
<p>　　"Ah, that she was, she was. So between her and me it is settled--what are you crying for NOW? why, you have won the day; the field isyours; your mother and you remain; I decamp." He whipped hisscabbard up with his left hand, and was going off without anotherword, if Josephine had not stopped him.</p> 
<p>　　"But, sir, what am I to think? what am I to hope? it is impossiblethat in this short interview--and we must not forget what is due toyou. You have bought the estate.""True; well, we will talk over that, to-morrow; but being turned outof the house, that was the bayonet thrust to the old lady. So yourun in and put her heart at rest about it. Tell her that she maylive and die in this house for Jean Raynal; and tell her about theold woman in the Rue Quincampoix.""God bless you, Jean Raynal!" cried Josephine, clasping her hands.</p> 
<p>　　"Are you going?" said he, peremptorily.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, yes!" and she darted towards the chateau.</p> 
<p>　　But when she had taken three steps she paused, and seemed irresolute.</p> 
<p>　　She turned, and in a moment she had glided to Raynal again and hadtaken his hand before he could hinder her, and pressed two velvetlips on it, and was away again, her cheeks scarlet at what she haddone, and her wet eyes beaming with joy. She skimmed the grass likea lapwing; you would have taken her at this minute for Rose, or forVirgil's Camilla; at the gate she turned an instant and clasped herhands together, with such a look, to show Raynal she blessed himagain, then darted into the house.</p> 
<p>　　"Aha, my lady," said he, as he watched her fly, "behold you changeda little since you came out." He was soon on the high road marchingdown to the town at a great rate, his sword clanking, and thus ranhis thoughts: "This does one good; you are right, my old woman.</p> 
<p>　　Your son's bosom feels as warm as toast. Long live the five-francpieces! And they pretend money cannot make a fellow happy. Theylie; it is because they do not know how to spend it."Meantime at the chateau, as still befalls in emergencies and trials,the master spirit came out and took its real place. Rose was nowthe mistress of Beaurepaire; she set Jacintha, and Dard, and thedoctor, to pack up everything of value in the house. "Do it thismoment!" she cried; "once that notary gets possession of the house,it may be too late. Enough of folly and helplessness. We havefooled away house and lands; our movables shall not follow them."The moment she had set the others to work, she wrote a single lineto Riviere to tell him the chateau and lands were sold, and would hecome to Beaurepaire at once? She ran with it herself to Bigot'sauberge, the nearest post-office, and then back to comfort hermother.</p> 
<p>　　The baroness was seated in her arm-chair, moaning and wringing herhands, and Rose was nursing and soothing her, and bathing hertemples with her last drop of eau de Cologne, and trying in vain toput some of her own courage into her, when in came Josephine radiantwith happiness, crying "Joy! joy! joy!" and told her strange tale,with this difference, that she related her own share in it brieflyand coldly, and was more eloquent than I about the strange soldier'sgoodness, and the interest her mother had awakened in his heart.</p> 
<p>　　And she told about the old woman in the Rue Quincampoix, her ruggedphrases, and her noble, tender heart. The baroness, deaf to Rose'sconsolations, brightened up directly at Josephine's news, and at herglowing face, as she knelt pouring the good news, and hope, andcomfort, point blank into her. But Rose chilled them both.</p> 
<p>　　"It is a generous offer," said, she, "but one we cannot accept. Wecannot live under so great an obligation. Is all the generosity tobe on the side of this Bonapartist? Are we noble in name only?</p> 
<p>　　What would our father have said to such a proposal?"Josephine hung her head. The baroness groaned.</p> 
<p>　　"No, mother," continued Rose; "let house and land go, but honor andtrue nobility remain.""What shall I do? you are cruel to me, Rose.""Mamma," cried the enthusiastic girl, "we need depend on no one.</p> 
<p>　　Josephine and I have youth and spirit.""But no money.""We have plenty of jewels, and pictures, and movables. We can takea farm.""A farm!" shrieked the baroness.</p> 
<p>　　"Why, his uncle has a farm, and we have had recourse to him forhelp: better a farmhouse than an almshouse, though that almshousewere a palace instead of a chateau."Josephine winced and held up her hand deprecatingly. The baronesspaled: it was a terrible stroke of language to come from herdaughter. She said sternly, "There is no answer to that. We wereborn nobles, let us die farmers: only permit me to die first.""Forgive me, mother," said Rose, kneeling. "I was wrong; it is forme to obey you, not to dictate. I speak no more." And, afterkissing her mother and Josephine, she crept away, but she left herwords sticking in both their consciences.</p> 
<p>　　"HIS uncle," said the shrewd old lady. "She is no longer a child;and she says his uncle. This makes me half suspect it is her thatdear boy--Josephine, tell me the truth, which of you is it?""Dear mother, who should it be? they are nearly of an age: and whatman would not love our sweet Rose, that had eyes or a heart?"The baroness sighed deeply; and was silent. After awhile she said,"The moment they have a lover, he detaches their hearts from theirpoor old mother. She is no longer what my Josephine is to me.""Mamma, she is my superior. I see it more and more every day. Sheis proud: she is just; she looks at both sides. As for me, I am tooapt to see only what will please those I love.""And that is the daughter for me," cried the poor baroness, openingher arms wide to her.</p> 
<p>　　The next morning when they were at breakfast, in came Jacintha tosay the officer was in the dining-room and wanted to speak with theyoung lady he talked to yesterday. Josephine rose and went to him.</p> 
<p>　　"Well, mademoiselle," said he gayly, "the old woman was right. HereI have just got my orders to march: to leave France in a month. Apretty business it would have been if I had turned your mother out.</p> 
<p>　　So you see there is nothing to hinder you from living here.""In your house, sir?""Why not, pray?""Forgive us. But we feel that would be unjust to you, humiliatingto us: the poor are sometimes proud.""Of course they are," said Raynal: "and I don't want to offend yourpride. Confound the house: why did I go and buy it? It is no useto me except to give pain to worthy people." He then, after amoment's reflection, asked her if the matter could not be arrangedby some third party, a mutual friend. "Then again," said he, "Idon't know any friend of yours.""Yes, sir," said Josephine; "we have one friend, who knows you, andesteems you highly."She wanted to name Edouard; but she hesitated, and asked herconscience if it was fair to name him: and while she blushed andhesitated, lo and behold a rival referee hove in sight. Raynal sawhim, suddenly opened a window, and shouted, "Hallo come in here: youare wanted."Perrin had ridden up to complete the exodus of the De Beaurepaires,and was strolling about inspecting the premises he had expelled themfrom.</p> 
<p>　　Here was a pretty referee!</p> 
<p>　　Josephine almost screamed--"What are you doing? that is our enemy,our bitterest enemy. He has only sold you the estate to spite us,not for the love of you. I had--we had--we mortified his vanity.</p> 
<p>　　It was not our fault: he is a viper. Sir, pray, pray, pray be onyour guard against his counsels."These words spoken with rare fire and earnestness carriedconviction: but it was too late to recall the invitation. Thenotary entered the room, and was going to bow obsequiously toRaynal, when he caught sight of Josephine, and almost started.</p> 
<p>　　Raynal, after Josephine's warning, was a little at a loss how tomake him available; and even that short delay gave the notary's onefoible time to lead him into temptation. "Our foibles are ourmanias.""So," said he, "you have taken possession, commandant. Thesemilitary men are prompt, are they not, mademoiselle?""Do not address yourself to me, sir, I beg," said Josephine quietly.</p> 
<p>　　Perrin kept his self-command. "It is only as Commandant Raynal'sagent I presume to address so distinguished a lady: in thatcharacter I must inform you that whatever movables you have removedare yours: those we find in the house on entering we keep.""Come, come, not so fast," cried Raynal; "bother the chairs andtables! that is not the point.""Commandant," said the notary with dignity, "have I done anything tomerit this? have I served your interests so ill that you withdrawyour confidence from me?""No, no, my good fellow; but you exceed your powers. Just now Iwant you to take orders, not give them.""That is only just," said Perrin, "and I recall my hasty remark:</p> 
<p>　　excuse the susceptibility of a professional man, who is honored withthe esteem of his clients; and favor me with your wishes.""All right," said Raynal heartily. "Well, then--I want mademoiselleand her family to stay here while I go to Egypt with the FirstConsul. Mademoiselle makes difficulties; it offends her delicacy.""Comedy!" said the notary contemptuously.</p> 
<p>　　"Though her mother's life depends on her staying here.""Comedy!" said Perrin. Raynal frowned.</p> 
<p>　　"Her pride (begging her pardon) is greater than her affection.""Farce!""I have pitched upon you to reconcile the two.""Then you have pitched upon the wrong man," said Perrin bluntly. Headded obsequiously, "I am too much your friend. She has beentalking you over, no doubt; but you have a friend, an Ulysses, whois deaf to the siren's voice. I will be no party to such atransaction. I will not co-operate to humbug my friend and rob himof his rights."If Josephine was inferior to the notary in petty sharpness, she washis superior in the higher kinds of sagacity; and particularly ininstinctive perception of character. Her eye flashed with delightat the line Perrin was now taking with Raynal. The latter speedilyjustified her expectations: he just told Perrin to be off, and sendhim a more accommodating notary.</p> 
<p>　　"A more accommodating notary!" screamed Perrin, stung to madness bythis reproach. "There is not a more accommodating notary in Europe.</p> 
<p>　　Ungrateful man! is this the return for all my zeal, my integrity, myunselfishness? Is there another agent in the world who would havelet such a bargain as Beaurepaire fall into your hands? It servesme right for deviating from the rules of business. Send me anotheragent--oh!"The honest soldier was confused. The lawyer's eloquence overpoweredhim. He felt guilty. Josephine saw his simplicity, and made a cutwith a woman's two-edged sword. "Sir," said she coolly, "do you notsee it is an affair of money? This is his way of saying, Pay mehandsomely for so unusual a commission.""And I'll pay him double," cried Raynal, catching the idea; "don'tbe alarmed, I'll pay you for it.""And my zeal, my devotion?""Put 'em in figures.""And my prob--?""Add it up.""And my integ--?""Add them together: and don't bother me.""I see! I see! my poor soldier. You are no match for a woman'stongue.""Nor, for a notary's. Go to h---, and send in your bill!" roaredthe soldier in a fury. "Well, will you go?" and he marched at him.</p> 
<p>　　The notary scuttled out, with something between a snarl and a squeak.</p> 
<p>　　Josephine hid her face in her hands.</p> 
<p>　　"What is the matter with you?" inquired Raynal. "Not crying again,surely!""Me! I never cry--hardly. I hid my face because I could not helplaughing. You frightened me, sir," said she: then very demurely, "Iwas afraid you were going to beat him.""No, no; a good soldier never leathers a civilian if he can possiblyhelp it; it looks so bad; and before a lady!""Oh, I would have forgiven you, monsieur," said Josephine benignly,and something like a little sun danced in her eye.</p> 
<p>　　"Now, mademoiselle, since my referee has proved a pig, it is yourturn. Choose you a mutual friend."Josephine hesitated. "Ours is so young. You know him very well.</p> 
<p>　　You are doubtless the commandant of whom I once heard him speak withsuch admiration: his name is Riviere, Edouard Riviere.""Know him? he is my best officer, out and out." And without amoment's hesitation he took Edouard's present address, and acceptedthat youthful Daniel as their referee; then looked at his watch andmarched off to his public duties with sabre clanking at his heels.</p> 
<p>　　The notary went home gnashing his teeth. His sweet revenge wasturned to wormwood this day. Raynal's parting commissions rang inhis ear; in his bitter mood the want of logical sequence in the twoorders disgusted him.</p> 
<p>　　So he inverted them.</p> 
<p>　　He sent in a thundering bill the very next morning, but postponedthe other commission till his dying day.</p> 
<p>　　As for Josephine, she came into the drawing-room beaming with loveand happiness, and after kissing both her mother and Rose withgentle violence, she let them know the strange turn things hadtaken.</p> 
<p>　　And she whispered to Rose, "Only think, YOUR Edouard to be OURreferee!"Rose blushed and bent over her work; and wondered how Edouard woulddischarge so grave an office.</p> 
<p>　　The matter approached a climax; for, as the reader is aware, Edouardwas hourly expected at Beaurepaire.</p> 
<p>　　He did not come; but it was not his fault. On receiving Rose'sletter he declined to stay another hour at his uncle's.</p> 
<p>　　He flung himself on his horse; and, before he was well settled onthe stirrups, the animal shied violently at a wheelbarrow some foolhad left there; and threw Edouard on the stones of the courtyard.</p> 
<p>　　He jumped up in a moment and laughed at Marthe's terror; meantime afarm-servant caught the nag and brought him back to his work.</p> 
<p>　　But when Edouard went to put his hand on the saddle, he found itwould not obey him. "Wait a minute," said he; "my arm is benumbed.""Let me see!" said the farmer, and examined the limb himself;"benumbed? yes; and no wonder. Jacques, get on the brute and ridefor the surgeon.""Are you mad, uncle?" cried Edouard. "I can't spare my horse, and Iwant no surgeon; it will be well directly.""It will be worse before it is better.""I don't know what you mean, uncle; it is only numbed, ah! it hurtswhen I rub it.""It is worse than numbed, boy; it is broken.""Broken? nonsense:" and he looked at it in piteous bewilderment:</p> 
<p>　　"how can it be broken? it does not hurt except when I touch it.""It WILL hurt: I know all about it. I broke mine fifteen years ago:</p> 
<p>　　fell off a haystack.""Oh, how unfortunate I am!" cried Edouard, piteously. "But I willgo to Beaurepaire all the same. I can have the thing mended there,as well as here.""You will go to bed," said the old man, quietly; "that is whereYOU'LL go.""I'll go to blazes sooner," yelled the young one.</p> 
<p>　　The old man made a signal to his myrmidons, whom Marthe's cries hadbrought around, and four stout fellows took hold of Edouard by thelegs and the left shoulder and carried him up-stairs raging andkicking; and deposited him on a bed.</p> 
<p>　　Presently he began to feel faint, and so more reasonable. They cuthis coat off, and put him in a loose wrapper, and after considerabledelay the surgeon came, and set his arm skilfully, and behold thisardent spirit caged. He chafed and fretted sadly. Fortitude wasnot his forte.</p> 
<p>　　It was two days after his accident. He was lying on his back,environed by slops and cursing his evil fate, and fretting his soulout of its fleshly prison, when suddenly he heard a cheerfultrombone saying three words to Marthe, then came a clink-clank, andMarthe ushered into the sickroom the Commandant Raynal. The sickman raised himself in bed, with great surprise and joy.</p> 
<p>　　"O commandant! this is kind to come and see your poor officer inpurgatory.""Ah," cried Raynal, "you see I know what it is. I have been chaineddown by the arm, and the leg, and all: it is deadly tiresome.""Tiresome! it is--it is--oh, dear commandant, Heaven bless you forcoming!""Ta! ta! ta! I am come on my own business.""All the better. I have nothing to do; that is what kills me. I'meating my own heart.""Cannibal! Well, my lad, since you are in that humor, cheer up, forI bring you a job, and a tough one; it has puzzled me.""What is it, commandant? What is it?""Well, do you know a house and a family called Beaurepaire?""Do I know Beaurepaire?"And the pale youth turned very red; and stared with awe at thiswizard of a commandant. He thought he was going to be called overthe coals for frequenting a disaffected family. "Well," saidRaynal, "I have been and bought this Beaurepaire."Edouard uttered a loud exclamation. "It was YOU bought it! shenever told me that.""Yes," said Raynal, "I am the culprit; and we have fixed on you toundo my work without hurting their pride too much, poor souls; butlet us begin with the facts."Then Raynal told him my story after his fashion. Of course I shallnot go and print his version; you might like his concise way betterthan my verbose; and I'm not here to hold up any man's coat-tails.</p> 
<p>　　Short as he made it, Edouard's eyes were moist more than once; andat the end he caught Raynal's hand and kissed it. Then he askedtime to reflect; "for," said he, "I must try and be just.""I'll give you an hour," said Raynal, with an air of grandmunificence. The only treasure he valued was time.</p> 
<p>　　In less than an hour Edouard had solved the knot, to his entiresatisfaction; he even gave the commandant particular instructionsfor carrying out his sovereign decree. Raynal received these ordersfrom his subordinate with that simplicity which formed part of hisamazing character, and rode home relieved of all responsibility inthe matter.</p> 
<p>　　COMMANDANT RAYNAL TO MADEMOISELLE DE BEAUREPAIRE.</p> 
<p>　　Mademoiselle,--Before I could find time to write to our referee,news came in that he had just broken his arm;--"Oh! oh, dear! our poor Edouard!"And if poor Edouard had seen the pale faces, and heard the falteringaccents, it would have reconciled him to his broken arm almost.</p> 
<p>　　This hand-grenade the commandant had dropped so coolly among them,it was a long while ere they could recover from it enough to readthe rest of the letter,--so I rode over to him, and found him on his back, fretting for wantof something to do. I told him the whole story. He undertook thebusiness. I have received his instructions, and next week shall beat his quarters to clear off his arrears of business, and makeacquaintance with all your family, if they permit.</p> 
<p>　　RAYNAL.</p> 
<p>　　As the latter part of this letter seemed to require a reply, thebaroness wrote a polite note, and Jacintha sent Dard to leave it forthe commandant at Riviere's lodgings. But first they all sat downand wrote kind and pitying and soothing letters to Edouard. Need Isay these letters fell upon him like balm?</p> 
<p>　　They all inquired carelessly in their postscripts what he haddecided as their referee. He replied mysteriously that they wouldknow that in a week or two. Meantime, all he thought it prudent totell them was that he had endeavored to be just to both parties.</p> 
<p>　　"Little solemn puppy," said Rose, and was racked with curiosity.</p> 
<p>　　Next week Raynal called on the baroness. She received him alone.</p> 
<p>　　They talked about Madame Raynal. The next day he dined with thewhole party, and the commandant's manners were the opposite of whatthe baroness had inculcated. But she had a strong prejudice in hisfavor. Had her feelings been the other way his brusquerie wouldhave shocked her. It amused her. If people's hearts are with you,THAT for their heads!</p> 
<p>　　He came every day for a week, chatted with the baroness, walked withthe young ladies; and when after work he came over in the evening,Rose used to cross-examine him, and out came such descriptions ofbattles and sieges, such heroism and such simplicity mixed, as madethe evening pass delightfully. On these occasions the young ladiesfixed their glowing eyes on him, and drank in his character as wellas his narrative, in which were fewer "I's" than in anything of thesort you ever read or heard.</p> 
<p>　　At length Rose contrived to draw him aside, and, hiding hercuriosity under feigned nonchalance, asked him what the referee haddecided. He told her that was a secret for the present.</p> 
<p>　　"Well, but," said Rose, "not from me. Edouard and I have nosecrets.""Come, that's good," said Raynal. "Why, you are the very one hewarned me against the most; said you were as curious as Mother Eve,and as sharp as her needle.""Then he is a little scurrilous traitor," cried Rose, turning veryred. "So that is how he talks of me behind my back, and calls me anangel to my face; I'll pay him for this. Do tell me, commandant;never mind what HE says.""What! disobey orders?""Orders? to you from that boy!""Oh!" said Raynal, "for that matter, we soldiers are used to commandone moment, and obey the next."In a word, this military pedant was impracticable, and Rose gave himup in disgust, and began to call up a sulky look when the other twosang his praises. For the old lady pronounced him charming, andJosephine said he was a man of crystal; never said a word he did notmean, and she wished she was like him. But the baroness thoughtthis was going a little too far.</p> 
<p>　　"No, thank you," said she hastily; "he is a man, a thorough man. Hewould make an intolerable woman. A fine life if one had a parcel ofwomen about, all blurting out their real minds every moment, andnever smoothing matters.""Mamma, what a horrid picture!" chuckled Rose.</p> 
<p>　　She then proposed that at his next visit they should all three makean earnest appeal to him to let them know what Edouard had decided.</p> 
<p>　　But Josephine begged to be excused, feared it would be hardlydelicate; and said languidly that for her part she felt they were ingood hands, and prescribed patience. The baroness acquiesced, andpoor Rose and her curiosity were baffled on every side.</p> 
<p>　　At last, one fine day, her torments were relieved without anyfurther exertion on her part. Jacintha bounced into the drawing-room with a notice that the commandant wanted to speak to Josephinea minute out in the Pleasaunce.</p> 
<p>　　"How droll he is," said Rose; "fancy sending in for a young ladylike that. Don't go, Josephine; how, he would stare.""My dear, I no more dare disobey him than if I was one of hissoldiers." And she laid down her work, and rose quietly to do whatshe was bid.</p> 
<p>　　"Well," said Rose, superciliously, "go to your commanding officer.</p> 
<p>　　And, O Josephine, if you are worth anything at all, do get out ofhim what that Edouard has settled."Josephine kissed her, and promised to try. After the firstsalutation, there was a certain hesitation about Raynal whichJosephine had never seen a trace of in him before; so, to put him athis ease, and at the same time keep her promise to Rose, she askedtimidly if their mutual friend had been able to suggest anything.</p> 
<p>　　"What! don't you know that I have been acting all along upon hisinstructions?" answered Raynal.</p> 
<p>　　"No, indeed! and you have not told us what he advised.""Told you? why, of course not; they were secret instructions. Ihave obeyed one set, and now I come to the other; and there is thedifficulty, being a kind of warfare I know nothing about.""It must be savage warfare, then," suggested the lady politely.</p> 
<p>　　"Not a bit of it. Now, who would have thought I was such a coward?"Josephine was mystified; however, she made a shrewd guess. "Do youfear a repulse from any one of us? Then, I suppose, you meditatesome extravagant act of generosity.""Not I.""Of delicacy, then.""Just the reverse. Confound the young dog! why is he not here tohelp me?""But, after all," suggested Josephine, "you have only to carry outhis instructions.""That is true! that is true! but when a fellow is a coward, apoltroon, and all that sort of thing."This repeated assertion of cowardice on the part of the livingDamascus blade that stood bolt-upright before her, struck Josephineas so funny that she laughed merrily, and bade him fancy it was onlya fort he was attacking instead of the terrible Josephine; whom nonebut heroes feared, she assured him.</p> 
<p>　　This encouragement, uttered in jest, was taken in earnest. Thesoldier thanked her, and rallied visibly at the comparison. "Allright," said he, "as you say, it is only a fort--so--mademoiselle!""Monsieur!""Hum! will you lend me your hand for a moment?""My hand! what for? there," and she put it out an inch a minute. Hetook it, and inspected it closely.</p> 
<p>　　"A charming hand; the hand of a virtuous woman?""Yes," said Josephine as cool as a cucumber, too sublimely andabsurdly innocent even to blush.</p> 
<p>　　"Is it your own?""Sir!" She blushed at that, I can tell you.</p> 
<p>　　"Because if it was, I would ask you to give it me. (I've fired thefirst shot anyway.)"Josephine whipped her hand off his palm, where it lay like creamspilt on a trencher.</p> 
<p>　　"Ah! I see; you are not free: you have a lover.""No, no!" cried Josephine in distress; "I love nobody but my motherand sister: I never shall.""Your mother," cried Raynal; "that reminds me; he told me to askher; by Jove, I think he told me to ask her first;" and Raynal upwith his scabbard and was making off.</p> 
<p>　　Josephine begged him to do nothing of the kind.</p> 
<p>　　"I can save you the trouble," said she.</p> 
<p>　　"Ah, but my instructions! my instructions!" cried the militarypedant, and ran off into the house, and left Josephine "plantedthere," as they say in France.</p> 
<p>　　Raynal demanded a private interview of the baroness so significantlyand unceremoniously that Rose had no alternative but to retire, butnot without a glance of defiance at the bear. She ran straight,without her bonnet, into the Pleasaunce to slake her curiosity atJosephine. That young lady was walking pensively, but turned atsight of Rose, and the sisters came together with a clash of tongues.</p> 
<p>　　"O Rose! he has"--"Oh!"So nimbly does the female mind run on its little beaten tracks, thatit took no more than those syllables for even these innocent youngwomen to communicate that Raynal had popped.</p> 
<p>　　Josephine apologized for this weakness in a hero. "It wasn't hisfault," said she. "It is your Edouard who set him to do it.""My Edouard? Don't talk in that horrid way: I have no Edouard. Yousaid 'no' of course.""Something of the kind.""What, did you not say 'no' plump?""I did not say it brutally, dear.""Josephine, you frighten me. I know you can't say 'no' to any one;and if you don't say 'no' plump to such a man as this, you might aswell say 'yes.'""Well, love," said Josephine, "you know our mother will relieve meof this; what a comfort to have a mother!"They waited for Raynal's departure, to go to the baroness. They hadto wait a long time. Moreover, when he did leave the chateau hecame straight into the Pleasaunce. At sight of him Rose seizedJosephine tight and bade her hold her tongue, as she could not say"no" plump to any one. Josephine was far from raising any objectionto the arrangement.</p> 
<p>　　"Monsieur," said Rose, before he could get a word out, "even if shehad not declined, I could not consent."Raynal tapped his forehead reflectively, and drew forth from memorythat he had no instructions whatever to ask HER consent.</p> 
<p>　　She colored high, but returned to the charge.</p> 
<p>　　"Is her own consent to be dispensed with too? She declined thehonor, did she not?""Of course she did; but this was anticipated in my instructions. Iam to be sure and not take the first two or three refusals.""O Josephine, look at that insolent boy: he has found you out.""Insolent boy!" cried Raynal; "why, it is the referee of your ownchoosing, and as well behaved a lad as ever I saw, and a zealousofficer.""My kind friends," put in Josephine with a sweet languor, "I cannotlet you quarrel about a straw.""It is not about a straw," said Raynal, "it is about you.""The distinction involves a compliment, sir," said Josephine; thenshe turned to Rose, "Is it possible you do not see Monsieur Raynal'sstrange proposal in its true light? and you so shrewd in general.</p> 
<p>　　He has no personal feeling whatever in this eccentric proceeding: hewants to make us all happy, especially my mother, without seeming tolay us under too great an obligation. Surely good-nature was nevercarried so far before; ha, ha! Monsieur, I will encumber you with myfriendship forever, if you permit me, but farther than that I willnot abuse your generosity.""Now look here, mademoiselle," began Raynal bluntly, "I did startwith a good motive at first, that there's no denying. But, since Ihave been every day in your company, and seen how good and kind youare to all about you, I have turned selfish; and I say to myself,what a comfort such a wife as you would be to a soldier! Why, onlyto have you to write letters home to, would be worth half a fellow'spay. Do you know sometimes when I see the fellows writing theirletters it gives me a knock here to think I have no one at all towrite to."Josephine sighed.</p> 
<p>　　"So you see I am not so mighty disinterested. Now, mademoiselle,you speak so charmingly, I can't tell what you mean: can't tellwhether you say 'no' because you could never like me, or whether itis out of delicacy, and you only want pressing. So I say no more atpresent: it is a standing offer. Take a day to consider. Take twoif you like. I must go to the barracks; good-day.""Oh! this must be put an end to at once," said Rose.</p> 
<p>　　"With all my heart," replied Josephine; "but how?""Come to our mother, and settle that," said the impetuous sister,and nearly dragged the languid one into the drawing-room.</p> 
<p>　　To their surprise they found the baroness walking up and down theroom with unusual alacrity for a person of her years. She no soonercaught sight of Josephine than she threw her arms open to her withjoyful vivacity, and kissed her warmly. "My love, you have savedus. I am a happy old woman. If I had all France to pick from Icould not have found a man so worthy of my Josephine. He is brave,he is handsome, he is young, he is a rising man, he is a good son,and good sons make good husbands--and--I shall die at Beaurepaire,shall I not, Madame the Commandante?"Josephine held her mother round the neck, but never spoke. After asilence she held her tighter, and cried a little.</p> 
<p>　　"What is it?" asked the baroness confidentially of Rose, but withoutshowing any very profound concern.</p> 
<p>　　"Mamma! mamma! she does not love him.""Love him? She would be no daughter of mine if she loved a man atsight. A modest woman loves her husband only.""But she scarcely knows Monsieur Raynal.""She knows more of him than I knew of your father when I marriedhim. She knows his virtues and appreciates them. I have heard her,have I not, love? Esteem soon ripens into love when they are oncefairly married.""Mother, does her silence then tell you nothing? Her tears--arethey nothing to you?""Silly child! These are tears that do not scald. The sweet soulweeps because she now for the first time sees she will have to leaveher mother. Alas! my eldest, it is inevitable. Mothers are notimmortal. While they are here it is their duty to choose goodhusbands for their daughters. My youngest, I believe, has chosenfor herself--like the nation. But for my eldest I choose. We shallsee which chooses the best. Meantime we stay at Beaurepaire, thanksto my treasure here.""Josephine! Josephine! you don't say one word," cried Rose indismay.</p> 
<p>　　"What CAN I say? I love my mother and I love you. You draw medifferent ways. I want you to be both happy.""Then if you will not speak out I must. Mother, do not deceiveyourself: it is duty alone that keeps her silent: this match isodious to her.""Then we are ruined. Josephine, is this match odious to you?""Not exactly odious: but I am very, very indifferent.""There!" cried Rose triumphantly.</p> 
<p>　　"There!" cried the baroness in the same breath, triumphantly. "Sheesteems his character; but his person is indifferent to her: inother words, she is a modest girl, and my daughter; and let me tellyou, Rose, that but for the misfortunes of our house, both mydaughters would be married as I was, without knowing half as much oftheir husbands as Josephine knows of this brave, honest, generous,filial gentleman.""Well, then, since she will not speak out, I will. Pity me: I loveher so. If this stranger, whom she does not love, takes her awayfrom us, he will kill me. I shall die; oh!"Josephine left her mother and went to console Rose.</p> 
<p>　　The baroness lost her temper at this last stroke of opposition.</p> 
<p>　　"Now the truth comes out, Rose; this is selfishness. Do not deceiveYOURself--selfishness!""Mamma!""You are only waiting to leave me yourself. Yet your eldest sister,forsooth, must be kept here for you,--till then." She added moregently, "Let me advise you to retire to your own room, and examineyour heart fairly. You will find there is a strong dash of egoismin all this.""If I do"--"You will retract your opposition.""My heart won't let me; but I will despise myself, and be silent."And the young lady, who had dried her eyes the moment she wasaccused of selfishness, walked, head erect, from the room.</p> 
<p>　　Josephine cast a deprecating glance at her mother. "Yes, my angel!"said the latter, "I was harsh. But we are no longer of one mind,and I suppose never shall be again.""Oh, yes, we shall. Be patient! Mother--you shall not leaveBeaurepaire."The baroness colored faintly at these four last words of herdaughter, and hung her head.</p> 
<p>　　Josephine saw that, and darted to her and covered her with kisses.</p> 
<p>　　That day the doctor scolded them both. "You have put your motherinto a high fever," said he; "here's a pulse; I do wish you would bemore considerate."The commandant did not come to dinner as usual. The evening passedheavily; their hearts were full of uncertainty.</p> 
<p>　　"We miss our merry, spirited companion," said the baroness with agrim look at Rose. Both young ladies assented with ludicrouseagerness.</p> 
<p>　　That night Rose came and slept with Josephine, and more than onceshe awoke with a start and seized Josephine convulsively and heldher tight.</p> 
<p>　　Accused of egoism! at first her whole nature rose in arms againstthe charge: but, after a while, coming as it did from so revered aperson, it forced her to serious self-examination. The poor girlsaid to herself, "Mamma is a shrewd woman. Am I after all deceivingmyself? Would she be happy, and am I standing in the way?" In themorning she begged her sister to walk with her in the park, so thatthey might be safe from interruption.</p> 
<p>　　There, she said sadly, she could not understand her own sister.</p> 
<p>　　"Why are you so calm and cold, while am I in tortures of anxiety?</p> 
<p>　　Have you made some resolve and not confided it to your Rose?""No, love," was the reply; "I am scarce capable of a resolution; Iam a mere thing that drifts.""Let me put it in other words, then. How will this end?""I hardly know.""Do you mean to marry Monsieur Raynal, then? answer me that.""No; but I should not wonder if he were to marry ME.""But you said 'no.'""Yes, I said 'no' once.""And don't you mean to say it again, and again, and again, tillkingdom come?""What is the use? you heard him say he would not desist any themore, and I care too little about the matter to go on persisting,and persisting, and persisting.""Why not, if he goes on pestering, and pestering, and pestering?""Ah, he is like you, all energy, at all hours; but I have so littlewhere my heart is unconcerned: he seems, too, to have a wish! Ihave none either way, and my conscience says 'marry him!'""Your conscience say marry one man when you love another?""Heaven forbid! Rose, I love no one: I HAVE loved; but now my heartis dead and silent; only my conscience says, 'You are the cause ofall your mother's trouble; you are the cause that Beaurepaire wassold. Now you can repair that mischief, and at the same time make abrave man happy, our benefactor happy.' It is a great temptation: Ihardly know why I said 'no' at all; surprise, perhaps--or to pleaseyou, pretty one."Rose groaned: "Are you then worth so little that you would throwyourself away on a man who does not love you, nor want you, and isquite as happy single?""No; not happy; he is only stout-hearted and good, and thereforecontent; and he is a character that it would be easy--in short, Ifeel my power here: I could make that man happy; he has nobody towrite to even, when he is away--poor fellow!""I shall lose all patience," cried Rose; "you are at your old trick,thinking of everybody but yourself: I let you do it in trifles, butI love you too well to permit it when the happiness of your wholelife is at stake. I must be satisfied on one point, or else thismarriage shall never take place: just answer me this; if CamilleDujardin stood on one side, and Monsieur Raynal on the other, andboth asked your hand, which would you take?""That will never be. Whose? Not his whom I despise. Esteem mightripen into love, but what must contempt end in?"This reply gave Rose great satisfaction. To exhaust all awkwardcontingencies, she said, "One question more, and I have done.</p> 
<p>　　Suppose Camille should turn out--be not quite--what shall I say--inexcusable?"At this unlucky gush, Josephine turned pale, then red, then paleagain, and cried eagerly, "Then all the world should not part us.</p> 
<p>　　Why torture me with such a question? Ah! you have heard something."And in a moment the lava of passion burst wildly through its thinsheet of ice. "I was blind. This is why you would save me fromthis unnatural marriage. You are breaking the good news to me bydegrees. There is no need. Quick--quick--let me have it. I havewaited three years; I am sick of waiting. Why don't you speak? Whydon't you tell me? Then I will tell YOU. He is alive--he is well--he is coming. It was not he those soldiers saw; they were so faroff. How could they tell? They saw a uniform but not a face.</p> 
<p>　　Perhaps he has been a prisoner, and so could not write; could notcome: but he is coming now. Why do you groan? why do you turn pale?</p> 
<p>　　ah! I see; I have once more deceived myself. I was mad. He I loveis still a traitor to France and me, and I am wretched forever. Oh!</p> 
<p>　　that I were dead! oh! that I were dead! No; don't speak to me:</p> 
<p>　　never mind me; this madness will pass as it has before, and leave mea dead thing among the living. Ah! sister, why did you wake me frommy dream? I was drifting so calmly, so peacefully, so dead, andpainless, drifting over the dead sea of the heart towards the livingwaters of gratitude and duty. I was going to make more than oneworthy soul happy; and seeing them happy, I should have been contentand useful--what am I now?--and comforted other hearts, and diedjoyful--and young. For God is good; he releases the meek andpatient from their burdens."With this came a flood of tears; and she leaned against a bough withher forehead on her arm, bowed like a wounded lily.</p> 
<p>　　"Accursed be that man's name, and MY tongue if ever I utter it againin your hearing!" cried Rose, weeping bitterly. "You are wiser thanI, and every way better. O my darling, dry your tears! Here hecomes: look! riding across the park.""Rose," cried Josephine, hastily, "I leave all to you. ReceiveMonsieur Raynal, and decline his offer if you think proper. It isyou who love me best. My mother would give me up for a house; foran estate, poor dear.""I would not give you for all the world.""I know it. I trust all to you.""Well, but don't go; stay and hear what I shall say.""Oh, no; that poor man is intolerable to me NOW. Let me avoid hissight, and think of his virtues."Rose was left alone, mistress of her sister's fate. She put herhead into her hands and filled with anxiety and sudden doubt.</p> 
<p>　　Like a good many more of us, she had been positive so long as thedecision did not rest with her. But with power comes responsibility,with responsibility comes doubt. Easy to be an advocate inre incerta; hard to be the judge. And she had but a few secondsto think in; for Raynal was at hand. The last thing in hermind before he joined her was the terrible power of that baseCamille over her sister. She despaired of curing Josephine, but ahusband might. There's such divinity doth hedge a husband ininnocent girls' minds.</p> 
<p>　　"Well, little lady," began Raynal, "and how are you, and how is mymother-in-law that is to be--or is not to be, as your sisterpleases; and how is SHE? have I frightened her away? There were twopetticoats, and now there is but one.""She left me to answer you.""All the worse for me: I am not to your taste.""Do not say that," said Rose, almost hysterically.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh! it is no sacrilege. Not one in fifty likes me.""But I</p>
