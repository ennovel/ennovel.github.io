He longedto be friends again with Rose, but did not know how. His own prideheld him back, and so did his fear that he had gone too far, andthat his offended mistress would not listen to an offer ofreconciliation from him. He sat down alone now to all his littlemeals. No sweet, mellow voices in his ear after the fatigues of theday. It was a dismal change in his life.</p> 
<p>　　At last, one day, he received three lines from Josephine, requestinghim to come and speak to her. He went over directly, full of vaguehopes. He found her seated pale and languid in a small room on theground floor.</p> 
<p>　　"What has she been doing to you, dear?" began she kindly.</p> 
<p>　　"Has she not told you, Madame Raynal?""No; she is refractory. She will tell me nothing, and that makes mefear she is the one in fault.""Oh! if she does not accuse me, I am sure I will not accuse her. Idare say I am to blame; it is not her fault that I cannot make herlove me.""But you can. She does.""Yes; but she loves others better, and she holds me out no hope itwill ever be otherwise. On this one point how can I hope for yoursympathy; unfortunately for me you are one of my rivals. She toldme plainly she never could love me as she loves you.""And you believed her?""I had good reason to believe her."Josephine smiled sadly. "Dear Edouard," said she, "you must notattach so much importance to every word we say. Does Rose at herage know everything? Is she a prophet? Perhaps she really fanciesshe will always love her sister as she does now; but you are a manof sense; you ought to smile and let her talk. When you marry heryou will take her to your own house; she will only see me now andthen; she will have you and your affection always present. Each daysome new tie between you and her. You two will share every joy,every sorrow. Your children playing at your feet, and reflectingthe features of both parents, will make you one. Your hearts willmelt together in that blessed union which raises earth so near toheaven; and then you will wonder you could ever be jealous of poorJosephine, who must never hope--ah, me!"Edouard, wrapped up in himself, mistook Josephine's emotion at thepicture she had drawn of conjugal love. He soothed her, and vowedupon his honor he never would separate Rose from her.</p> 
<p>　　"Madame Raynal," said he, "you are an angel, and I am a fiend.</p> 
<p>　　Jealousy must be the meanest of all sentiments. I never will bejealous again, above all, of you, sweet angel. Why, you are mysister as well as hers, and she has a right to love you, for I loveyou myself.""You make me very happy when you talk so," sighed Josephine. "Peaceis made?""Never again to be broken. I will go and ask her pardon. What isthe matter now?"For Jacintha was cackling very loud, and dismissing with ignominytwo beggars, male and female.</p> 
<p>　　She was industry personified, and had no sympathy with mendicity.</p> 
<p>　　In vain the couple protested, Heaven knows with what truth, thatthey were not beggars, but mechanics out of work. "March! tramp!"was Jacintha's least word. She added, giving the rein to herimagination, "I'll loose the dog." The man moved away, the womanturned appealingly to Edouard. He and Josephine came towards thegroup. She had got a sort of large hood, and in that hood shecarried an infant on her shoulders. Josephine inspected it. "Itlooks sickly, poor little thing," said she.</p> 
<p>　　"What can you expect, young lady?" said the woman. "Its mother hadto rise and go about when she ought to have been in her bed, and nowshe has not enough to give it.""Oh, dear!" cried Josephine. "Jacintha, give them some food and anice bottle of wine.""That I will," cried Jacintha, changing her tone with courtier-likealacrity. "I did not see she was nursing."Josephine put a franc into the infant's hand; the little fingersclosed on it with that instinct of appropriation, which is our firstand often our last sentiment. Josephine smiled lovingly on thechild, and the child seeing that gave a small crow.</p> 
<p>　　"Bless it," said Josephine, and thereupon her lovely head reareditself like a snake's, and then darted down on the child; and theyoung noble kissed the beggar's brat as if she would eat it.</p> 
<p>　　This won the mother's heart more than even the gifts.</p> 
<p>　　"Blessings on you, my lady!" she cried. "I pray the Lord not toforget this when a woman's trouble comes on you in your turn! It isa small child, mademoiselle, but it is not an unhealthy one. See."Inspection was offered, and eagerly accepted.</p> 
<p>　　Edouard stood looking on at some distance in amazement, mingled withdisgust.</p> 
<p>　　"Ugh!" said he, when she rejoined him, "how could you kiss thatnasty little brat?""Dear Edouard, don't speak so of a poor little innocent. Who wouldpity them if we women did not? It had lovely eyes.""Like saucers.""Yes.""It is no compliment when you are affectionate to anybody; youoverflow with benevolence on all creation, like the rose which shedsits perfume on the first-comer.""If he is not going to be jealous of me next," whined Josephine.</p> 
<p>　　She took him to Rose, and she said, "There, whenever good friendsquarrel, it is understood they were both in the wrong. Bygones areto be bygones; and when your time comes round to quarrel again,please consult me first, since it is me you will afflict." She leftthem together, and went and tapped timidly at the doctor's study.</p> 
<p>　　Aubertin received her with none of that reserve she had seen in him.</p> 
<p>　　He appeared both surprised and pleased at her visit to his littlesanctum. He even showed an emotion Josephine was at a loss toaccount for. But that wore off during the conversation, and,indeed, gave place to a sort of coldness.</p> 
<p>　　"Dear friend," said she, "I come to consult you about Rose andEdouard." She then told him what had happened, and hinted atEdouard's one fault. The doctor smiled. "It is curious. You havecome to draw my attention to a point on which it has been fixed forsome days past. I am preparing a cure for the two young fools; asevere remedy, but in their case a sure one."He then showed her a deed, wherein he had settled sixty thousandfrancs on Rose and her children. "Edouard," said he, "has a goodplace. He is active and rising, and with my sixty thousand francs,and a little purse of ten thousand more for furniture and nonsense,they can marry next week, if they like. Yes, marriage is asovereign medicine for both of these patients. She does not lovehim quite enough. Cure: marriage. He loves her a little too much.</p> 
<p>　　Cure: marriage.""O doctor!""Can't help it. I did not make men and women. We must take humannature as we find it, and thank God for it on the whole. Have younothing else to confide to me?""No, doctor.""Are you sure?""No, dear friend. But this is very near my heart," falteredJosephine.</p> 
<p>　　The doctor sighed; then said gently, "They shall be happy: as happyas you wish them."Meantime, in another room, a reconciliation scene was taking place,and the mutual concessions of two impetuous but generous spirits.</p> 
<p>　　The baroness noticed the change in Josephine's appearance.</p> 
<p>　　She asked Rose what could be the matter.</p> 
<p>　　"Some passing ailment," was the reply.</p> 
<p>　　"Passing? She has been so, on and off, a long time. She makes mevery anxious."Rose made light of it to her mother, but in her own heart she grewmore and more anxious day by day. She held secret conferences withJacintha; that sagacious personage had a plan to wake Josephine fromher deathly languor, and even soothe her nerves, and check thosepitiable fits of nervous irritation to which she had become subject.</p> 
<p>　　Unfortunately, Jacintha's plan was so difficult and so dangerous,that at first even the courageous Rose recoiled from it; but thereare dangers that seem to diminish when you look them long in theface.</p> 
<p>　　The whole party was seated in the tapestried room: Jacintha wasthere, sewing a pair of sheets, at a respectful distance from thegentlefolks, absorbed in her work; but with both ears on full cock.</p> 
<p>　　The doctor, holding his glasses to his eye, had just begun to readout the Moniteur.</p> 
<p>　　The baroness sat close to him, Edouard opposite; and the youngladies each in her corner of a large luxurious sofa, at some littledistance.</p> 
<p>　　"'The Austrians left seventy cannon, eight thousand men, and threecolors upon the field. Army of the North: General Menard defeatedthe enemy after a severe engagement, taking thirteen field-piecesand a quantity of ammunition.'"The baroness made a narrow-minded renmark. "That is always the waywith these journals," said she. "Austrians! Prussians! when it'sEgypt one wants to hear about."--"No, not a word about Egypt," saidthe doctor; "but there is a whole column about the Rhine, whereColonel Dujardin is--and Dard. If I was dictator, the firstnuisance I would put down is small type." He then spelled out asanguinary engagement: "eight thousand of the enemy killed. We havesome losses to lament. Colonel Dujardin"--"Only wounded, I hope," said the baroness.</p> 
<p>　　The doctor went coolly on. "At the head of the 24th brigade made abrilliant charge on the enemy's flank, that is described in thegeneral order as having decided the fate of the battle.""How badly you do read," said the old lady, sharply. "I thought hewas gone; instead of that he has covered himself with glory; but itis all our doing, is it not, young ladies? We saved his life.""We saved it amongst us, madame.""What is the matter, Rose?" said Edouard.</p> 
<p>　　"Nothing: give me the salts, quick."She only passed them, as it were, under her own nostrils; then heldthem to Josephine, who was now observed to be trembling all over.</p> 
<p>　　Rose contrived to make it appear that this was mere sympathy onJosephine's part.</p> 
<p>　　"Don't be silly, girls," cried the baroness, cheerfully; "there isnobody killed that we care about."Dr. Aubertin read the rest to himself.</p> 
<p>　　Edouard fell into a gloomy silence and tortured himself aboutCamille, and Rose's anxiety and agitation.</p> 
<p>　　By and by the new servant brought in a letter. It was the long-expected one from Egypt.</p> 
<p>　　"Here is something better than salts for you. A long letter,Josephine, and all in his own hand; so he is safe, thank Heaven! Iwas beginning to be uneasy again. You frightened me for that poorCamille: but this is worth a dozen Camilles; this is my son; I wouldgive my old life for him."--"My dear Mother--('Bless him!'), my dearwife, and my dear sister--('Well! you sit there like two rocks!')--We have just gained a battle--fifty colors. ('What do you think ofthat?') All the enemy's baggage and ammunition are in our hands.</p> 
<p>　　('This is something like a battle, this one.') Also the Pasha ofNatolie. ('Ah! the Pasha of Natolie; an important personage, nodoubt, though I never had the honor of hearing of him. Do youhear?--you on the sofa. My son has captured the Pasha of Natolie.</p> 
<p>　　He is as brave as Caesar.') But this success is not one of thosethat lead to important results ('Never mind, a victory is avictory'), and I should not wonder if Bonaparte was to dash home anyday. If so, I shall go with him, and perhaps spend a whole day withyou, on my way to the Rhine."At this prospect a ghastly look passed quick as lightning betweenRose and Josephine.</p> 
<p>　　The baroness beckoned Josephine to come close to her, and read herwhat followed in a lower tone of voice.</p> 
<p>　　"Tell my wife I love her more and more every day. I don't expect asmuch from her, but she will make me very happy if she can make shiftto like me as well as her family do."--"No danger! What husbanddeserves to be loved as he does? I long for his return, that hiswife, his mother, and his sister may all combine to teach this poorsoldier what happiness means. We owe him everything, Josephine, andif we did not love him, and make him happy, we should be monsters;now should we not?"Josephine stammered an assent.</p> 
<p>　　"NOW you may read his letter: Jacintha and all," said the baronessgraciously.</p> 
<p>　　The letter circulated. Meantime, the baroness conversed withAubertin in quite an undertone.</p> 
<p>　　"My friend, look at Josephine. That girl is ill, or else she isgoing to be ill.""Neither the one nor the other, madame," said Aubertin, looking hercoolly in the face.</p> 
<p>　　"But I say she is. Is a doctor's eye keener than a mother's?""Considerably," replied the doctor with cool and enviable effrontery.</p> 
<p>　　The baroness rose. "Now, children, for our evening walk. We shallenjoy it now.""I trust you may: but for all that I must forbid the evening air toone of the party--to Madame Raynal."The baroness came to him and whispered, "That is right. Thank you.</p> 
<p>　　See what is the matter with her, and tell me." And she carried offthe rest of the party.</p> 
<p>　　At the same time Jacintha asked permission to pass the rest of theevening with her relations in the village. But why that swift,quivering glance of intelligence between Jacintha and Rose deBeaurepaire when the baroness said, "Yes, certainly"?</p> 
<p>　　Time will show.</p> 
<p>　　Josephine and the doctor were left alone. Now Josephine had noticedthe old people whisper and her mother glance her way, and the wholewoman was on her guard. She assumed a languid complacency, and byway of shield, if necessary, took some work, and bent her eyes andapparently her attention on it.</p> 
<p>　　The doctor was silent and ill at ease.</p> 
<p>　　She saw he had something weighty on his mind. "The air would havedone me no harm," said she.</p> 
<p>　　"Neither will a few words with me.""Oh, no, dear friend. Only I think I should have liked a littlewalk this evening.""Josephine," said the doctor quietly, "when you were a child I savedyour life.""I have often heard my mother speak of it. I was choked by thecroup, and you had the courage to lance my windpipe.""Had I?" said the doctor, with a smile. He added gravely, "It seemsthen that to be cruel is sometimes kindness. It is the nature ofmen to love those whose life they save.""And they love you.""Well, our affection is not perfect. I don't know which is most toblame, but after all these years I have failed to inspire you withconfidence." The doctor's voice was sad, and Josephine's bosompanted.</p> 
<p>　　"Pray do not say so," she cried. "I would trust you with my life.""But not with your secret.""My secret! What secret? I have no secrets.""Josephine, you have now for full twelve months suffered in body andmind, yet you have never come to me for counsel, for comfort, for anold man's experience and advice, nor even for medical aid.""But, dear friend, I assure you"--"We DO NOT deceive our friend. We CANNOT deceive our doctor."Josephine trembled, but defended herself after the manner of hersex. "Dear doctor," said she, "I love you all the better for this.</p> 
<p>　　Your regard for me has for once blinded your science. I am not sorobust as you have known me, but there is nothing serious the matterwith me. Let us talk of something else. Besides, it is notinteresting to talk about one's self.""Very well; since there is nothing serious or interesting in yourcase, we will talk about something that is both serious andinteresting.""With all my heart;" and she smiled with a sense of relief.</p> 
<p>　　But the doctor leaned over the table to her, and said in a cautiousand most emphatic whisper, "We will talk about YOUR CHILD."The work dropped from Josephine's hands: she turned her face wildlyon Aubertin, and faltered out, "M--my child?""My words are plain," replied he gravely. "YOUR CHILD."When the doctor repeated these words, when Josephine looking in hisface saw he spoke from knowledge, however acquired, and not fromguess, she glided down slowly off the sofa and clasped his knees ashe stood before her, and hid her face in an agony of shame andterror on his knees.</p> 
<p>　　"Forgive me," she sobbed. "Pray do not expose me! Do not destroyme.""Unhappy young lady," said he, "did you think you had deceived me,or that you are fit to deceive any but the blind? Your face, youranguish after Colonel Dujardin's departure, your languor, and thenyour sudden robustness, your appetite, your caprices, your strangesojourn at Frejus, your changed looks and loss of health on yourreturn! Josephine, your old friend has passed many an hour thinkingof you, divining your folly, following your trouble step by step.</p> 
<p>　　Yet you never invited him to aid you."Josephine faltered out a lame excuse. If she had revered him lessshe could have borne to confess to him. She added it would be arelief to her to confide in him.</p> 
<p>　　"Then tell me all," said he.</p> 
<p>　　She consented almost eagerly, and told him--nearly all. The old manwas deeply affected. He murmured in a broken voice, "Your story isthe story of your sex, self-sacrifice, first to your mother, then toCamille, now to your husband.""And he is well worthy of any sacrifice I can make," said Josephine.</p> 
<p>　　"But oh, how hard it is to live!""I hope to make it less hard to you ere long," said the doctorquietly. He then congratulated himself on having forced Josephineto confide in him. "For," said he, "you never needed an experiencedfriend more than at this moment. Your mother will not always be soblind as of late. Edouard is suspicious. Jacintha is a shrewdyoung woman, and very inquisitive."Josephine was not at the end of her concealments: she was ashamed tolet him know she had made a confidant of Jacintha and not of him.</p> 
<p>　　She held her peace.</p> 
<p>　　"Then," continued Aubertin, "there is the terrible chance ofRaynal's return. But ere I take on me to advise you, what are yourown plans?""I don't know," said Josephine helplessly.</p> 
<p>　　"You--don't--know!" cried the doctor, looking at her in utteramazement.</p> 
<p>　　"It is the answer of a mad woman, is it not? Doctor, I am littlebetter. My foot has slipped on the edge of a precipice. I close myeyes, and let myself glide down it. What will become of me?""All shall be well," said Aubertin, "provided you do not still lovethat man."Josephine did not immediately reply: her thoughts turned inwards.</p> 
<p>　　The good doctor was proceeding to congratulate her on being cured ofa fatal passion, when she stopped him with wonder in her face. "Notlove him! How can I help loving him? I was his betrothed. Iwronged him in my thoughts. War, prison, anguish, could not killhim; he loved me so. He struggled bleeding to my feet; and could Ilet him die, after all? Could I be crueller than prison, andtorture, and despair?"The doctor sighed deeply; but, arming himself with the necessaryresolution, he sternly replied, "A woman of your name cannotvacillate between love and honor; such vacillations have but oneend. I will not let you drift a moral wreck between passion andvirtue; and that is what it will come to if you hesitate now.""Hesitate! Who can say I have hesitated where my honor wasconcerned? You can read our bodies then, but not our hearts. What!</p> 
<p>　　you see me so pale, forlorn, and dead, and that does not tell you Ihave bid Camille farewell forever? That we might be safer still Ihave not even told him he is a father: was ever woman so cruel as Iam? I have written him but one letter, and in that I must deceivehim. I told him I thought I might one day be happy, if I could hearthat he did not give way to despair. I told him we must never meetagain in this world. So now come what will: show me my duty and Iwill do it. This endless deceit burns my heart. Shall I tell myhusband? It will be but one pang more, one blush more for me. Butmy mother!" and, thus appealed to, Dr. Aubertin felt, for the firsttime, all the difficulty of the situation he had undertaken to cure.</p> 
<p>　　He hesitated, he was embarrassed.</p> 
<p>　　"Ah," said Josephine, "you see." Then, after a short silence, shesaid despairingly, "This is my only hope: that poor Raynal will belong absent, and that ere he returns mamma will lie safe from sorrowand shame in the little chapel. Doctor, when a woman of my ageforms such wishes as these, I think you might pity her, and forgiveher ill-treatment of you, for she cannot be very happy. Ah me! ahme! ah me!""Courage, poor soul! All is now in my hands, and I will save you,"said the doctor, his voice trembling in spite of him. "Guilt liesin the intention. A more innocent woman than you does not breathe.</p> 
<p>　　Two courses lay open to you: to leave this house with CamilleDujardin, or to dismiss him, and live for your hard duty till itshall please Heaven to make that duty easy (no middle course wastenable for a day); of these two paths you chose the right one, and,having chosen, I really think you are not called on to reveal yourmisfortune, and make those unhappy to whose happiness you havesacrificed your own for years to come.""Forever," said Josephine quietly.</p> 
<p>　　"The young use that word lightly. The old have almost ceased to useit. They have seen how few earthly things can conquer time."He resumed, "You think only of others, Josephine, but I shall thinkof you as well. I shall not allow your life to be wasted in aneedless struggle against nature." Then turning to Rose, who hadglided into the room, and stood amazed, "Her griefs were as manybefore her child was born, yet her health stood firm. Why? becausenature was on her side. Now she is sinking into the grave. Why?</p> 
<p>　　because she is defying nature. Nature intended her to be pressingher child to her bosom day and night; instead of that, a peasantwoman at Frejus nurses the child, and the mother pines atBeaurepaire."At this, Josephine leaned her face on her hands on the doctor'sshoulder. In this attitude she murmured to him, "I have never seenhim since I left Frejus." Dr. Aubertin sighed for her. Emboldenedby this, she announced her intention of going to Frejus the verynext day to see her little Henri. But to this Dr. Aubertindemurred. "What, another journey to Frejus?" said he, "when thefirst has already roused Edouard's suspicions; I can never consentto that."Then Josephine surprised them both. She dropped her coaxing voiceand pecked the doctor like an irritated pigeon. "Take care," saidshe, "don't be too cruel to me. You see I am obedient, resigned. Ihave given up all I lived for: but if I am never to have my littleboy's arms round me to console me, then--why torment me any longer?</p> 
<p>　　Why not say to me, 'Josephine, you have offended Heaven; pray forpardon, and die'?"Then the doctor was angry in his turn. "Oh, go then," said he, "goto Frejus; you will have Edouard Riviere for a companion this time.</p> 
<p>　　Your first visit roused his suspicions. So before you go tell yourmother all; for since she is sure to find it out, she had betterhear it from you than from another.""Doctor, have pity on me," said Josephine.</p> 
<p>　　"You have no heart," said Rose. "She shall see him though, in spiteof you.""Oh, yes! he has a heart," said Josephine: "he is my best friend.</p> 
<p>　　He will let me see my boy."All this, and the tearful eyes and coaxing yet trembling voice, washard to resist. But Aubertin saw clearly, and stood firm. He puthis handkerchief to his eyes a moment: then took the pining youngmother's hand. "And, do you think," said he, "I do not pity you andlove your boy? Ah! he will never want a father whilst I live; andfrom this moment he is under my care. I will go to see him; I willbring you news, and all in good time; I will place him where youshall visit him without imprudence; but, for the present, trust awiser head than yours or Rose's; and give me your sacred promise notto go to Frejus."Weighed down by his good-sense and kindness, Josephine resisted nolonger in words. She just lifted her hands in despair and began tocry. It was so piteous, Aubertin was ready to yield in turn, andconsent to any imprudence, when he met with an unexpected ally.</p> 
<p>　　"Promise," said Rose, doggedly.</p> 
<p>　　Josephine looked at her calmly through her tears.</p> 
<p>　　"Promise, dear," repeated Rose, and this time with an intonation sofine that it attracted Josephine's notice, but not the doctor's. Itwas followed by a glance equally subtle.</p> 
<p>　　"I promise," said Josephine, with her eye fixed inquiringly on hersister.</p> 
<p>　　For once she could not make the telegraph out: but she could see itwas playing, and that was enough. She did what Rose bid her; shepromised not to go to Frejus without leave.</p> 
<p>　　Finding her so submissive all of a sudden, he went on to suggestthat she must not go kissing every child she saw. "Edouard tells mehe saw you kissing a beggar's brat. The young rogue was going toquiz you about it at the dinner-table; luckily, he told me hisintention, and I would not let him. I said the baroness would beannoyed with you for descending from your dignity--and exposing anoble family to fleas--hush! here he is.""Tiresome!" muttered Rose, "just when"--Edouard came forward with a half-vexed face.</p> 
<p>　　However, he turned it off into play. "What have you been saying toher, monsieur, to interest her so? Give me a leaf out of your book.</p> 
<p>　　I need it."The doctor was taken aback for a moment, but at last he said slyly,"I have been proposing to her to name the day. She says she mustconsult you before she decides that.""Oh, you wicked doctor!--and consult HIM of all people!""So be off, both of you, and don't reappear before me till it issettled."Edouard's eyes sparkled. Rose went out with a face as red as fire.</p> 
<p>　　It was a balmy evening. Edouard was to leave them for a week thenext day. They were alone: Rose was determined he should go awayquite happy. Everything was in Edouard's favor: he pleaded hiscause warmly: she listened tenderly: this happy evening her piquancyand archness seemed to dissolve into tenderness as she and Edouardwalked hand in hand under the moon: a tenderness all the moreheavenly to her devoted lover, that she was not one of those angelswho cloy a man by invariable sweetness.</p> 
<p>　　For a little while she forgot everything but her companion. In thatsoft hour he won her to name the day, after her fashion.</p> 
<p>　　"Josephine goes to Paris with the doctor in about three weeks,"murmured she.</p> 
<p>　　"And you will stay behind, all alone?""Alone? that shall depend on you, monsieur."On this Edouard caught her for the first time in his arms.</p> 
<p>　　She made a faint resistance.</p> 
<p>　　"Seal me that promise, sweet one!""No! no!--there!"He pressed a delicious first kiss upon two velvet lips that in theirinnocence scarcely shunned the sweet attack.</p> 
<p>　　For all that, the bond was no sooner sealed after this fashion, thanthe lady's cheek began to burn.</p> 
<p>　　"Suppose we go in NOW?" said she, dryly.</p> 
<p>　　"Ah, not yet.""It is late, dear Edouard."And with these words something returned to her mind with its fullforce: something that Edouard had actually made her forget. Shewanted to get rid of him now.</p> 
<p>　　"Edouard," said she, "can you get up early in the morning? If youcan, meet me here to-morrow before any of them are up; then we cantalk without interruption."Edouard was delighted.</p> 
<p>　　"Eight o'clock?""Sooner if you like. Mamma bade me come and read to her in her roomto-night. She will be waiting for me. Is it not tiresome?""Yes, it is.""Well, we must not mind that, dear; in three weeks' time we are tohave too much of one another, you know, instead of too little.""Too much! I shall never have enough of you. I shall hate the nightwhich will rob me of the sight of you for so many hours in thetwenty-four.""If you can't see me, perhaps you may hear me; my tongue runs bynight as well as by day.""Well, that is a comfort," said Edouard, gravely. "Yes, littlequizzer, I would rather hear you scold than an angel sing. Judge,then, what music it is when you say you love me!""I love you, Edouard."Edouard kissed her hand warmly, and then looked irresolutely at herface.</p> 
<p>　　"No, no!" said she, laughing and blushing. "How rude you are. Nexttime we meet.""That is a bargain. But I won't go till you say you love me again.</p> 
<p>　　"Edouard, don't be silly. I am ashamed of saying the same thing sooften--I won't say it any more. What is the use? You know I loveyou. There, I HAVE said it: how stupid!""Adieu, then, my wife that is to be.""Adieu! dear Edouard.""My hus--go on--my hus--""My huswife that shall be."Then they walked very slowly towards the house, and once more Roseleft quizzing, and was all tenderness.</p> 
<p>　　"Will you not come in, and bid them 'good-night'?""No, my own; I am in heaven. Common faces--common voices wouldbring me down to earth. Let me be alone;--your sweet words ringingin my ear. I will dilute you with nothing meaner than the stars.</p> 
<p>　　See how bright they shine in heaven; but not so bright as you shinein my heart.""Dear Edouard, you flatter me, you spoil me. Alas! why am I notmore worthy of your love?""More worthy! How can that be?"Rose sighed.</p> 
<p>　　"But I will atone for all. I will make you a better--(here shesubstituted a full stop for a substantive)--than you expect. Youwill see else."She lingered at the door: a proof that if Edouard, at thatparticular moment, had seized another kiss, there would have been novery violent opposition or offence.</p> 
<p>　　But he was not so impudent as some. He had been told to wait tillthe next meeting for that. He prayed Heaven to bless her, and sothe affianced lovers parted for the night.</p> 
<p>　　It was about nine o'clock. Edouard, instead of returning to hislodgings, started down towards the town, to conclude a bargain withthe innkeeper for an English mare he was in treaty for. He wantedher for to-morrow's work; so that decided him to make the purchase.</p> 
<p>　　In purchases, as in other matters, a feather turns the balancedscale. He sauntered leisurely down. It was a very clear night; thefull moon and the stars shining silvery and vivid. Edouard's heartswelled with joy. He was loved after all, deeply loved; and inthree short weeks he was actually to be Rose's husband: her lord andmaster. How like a heavenly dream it all seemed--the first hopelesscourtship, and now the wedding fixed! But it was no dream; he felther soft words still murmur music at his heart, and the shadow ofher velvet lips slept upon his own.</p> 
<p>　　He had strolled about a league when he heard the ring of a horse'shoofs coming towards him, accompanied by a clanking noise; it camenearer and nearer, till it reached a hill that lay a little ahead ofEdouard; then the sounds ceased; the cavalier was walking his horseup the hill.</p> 
<p>　　Presently, as if they had started from the earth, up popped betweenEdouard and the sky, first a cocked hat that seemed in that light tobe cut with a razor out of flint; then the wearer, phosphorescenthere and there; so brightly the keen moonlight played on hisepaulets and steel scabbard. A step or two nearer, and Edouard gavea great shout; it was Colonel Raynal.</p> 
<p>　　After the first warm greeting, and questions and answers, Raynaltold him he was on his way to the Rhine with despatches.</p> 
<p>　　"To the Rhine?"I am allowed six days to get there. I made a calculation, and foundI could give Beaurepaire half a day. I shall have to make up for itby hard riding. You know me; always in a hurry. It is Bonaparte'sfault this time. He is always in a hurry too.""Why, colonel," said Edouard, "let us make haste then. Mind they goearly to rest at the chateau.""But you are not coming my way, youngster?""Not coming your way? Yes, but I am. Yours is a face I don't seeevery day, colonel; besides I would not miss THEIR faces, especiallythe baroness's and Madame Raynal's, at sight of you; and, besides,"--and the young gentleman chuckled to himself, and thought of Rose'swords, "the next time we meet;" well, this will be the next time.</p> 
<p>　　"May I jump up behind?"Colonel Raynal nodded assent. Edouard took a run, and lighted likea monkey on the horse's crupper. He pranced and kicked at thisunexpected addition; but the spur being promptly applied to hisflanks, he bounded off with a snort that betrayed more astonishmentthan satisfaction, and away they cantered to Beaurepaire, withoutdrawing rein.</p> 
<p>　　"There," said Edouard, "I was afraid they would be gone to bed; andthey are. The very house seems asleep--fancy--at half-past ten.""That is a pity," said Raynal, "for this chateau is the strongholdof etiquette. They will be two hours dressing before they will comeout and shake hands. I must put my horse into the stable. Go youand give the alarm.""I will, colonel. Stop, first let me see whether none of them areup, after all."And Edouard walked round the chateau, and soon discovered a light atone window, the window of the tapestried room. Running round theother way he came slap upon another light: this one was nearer theground. A narrow but massive door, which he had always seen notonly locked but screwed up, was wide open; and through the aperturethe light of a candle streamed out and met the moonlight streamingin.</p> 
<p>　　"Hallo!" cried Edouard.</p> 
<p>　　He stopped, turned, and looked in.</p> 
<p>　　"Hallo!" he cried again much louder.</p> 
<p>　　A young woman was sleeping with her feet in the silvery moonlight,and her head in the orange-colored blaze of a flat candle, whichrested on the next step above of a fine stone staircase, whoseexistence was now first revealed to the inquisitive Edouard.</p> 
<p>　　Coming plump upon all this so unexpectedly, he quite started.</p> 
<p>　　"Why, Jacintha!"He touched her on the shoulder to wake her. No. Jacintha wassleeping as only tired domestics can sleep. He might have taken thecandle and burnt her gown off her back. She had found a step thatfitted into the small of her back, and another that supported herhead, and there she was fast as a door.</p> 
<p>　　At this moment Raynal's voice was heard calling him.</p> 
<p>　　"There is a light in that bedroom.""It is not a bedroom, colonel; it is our sitting-room now. We shallfind them all there, or at least the young ladies; and perhaps thedoctor. The baroness goes to bed early. Meantime I can show youone of our dramatis personae, and an important one too. She rulesthe roost."He took him mysteriously and showed him Jacintha.</p> 
<p>　　Moonlight by itself seems white, and candlelight by itself seemsyellow; but when the two come into close contrast at night, candleturns a reddish flame, and moonlight a bluish gleam.</p> 
<p>　　So Jacintha, with her shoes in this celestial sheen, and her face inthat demoniacal glare, was enough to knock the gazer's eye out.</p> 
<p>　　"Make a good sentinel--this one," said Raynal--"an outlying picketfor instance, on rough ground, in front of the enemy's riflemen.""Ha! ha! colonel! Let us see where this staircase leads. I have anidea it will prove a short cut.""Where to?""To the saloon, or somewhere, or else to some of Jacintha's haunts.</p> 
<p>　　Serve her right for going to sleep at the mouth of her den.""Forward then--no, halt! Suppose it leads to the bedrooms? Mindthis is a thundering place for ceremony. We shall get drummed outof the barracks if we don't mind our etiquette."At this they hesitated; and Edouard himself thought, on the whole,it would be better to go and hammer at the front door.</p> 
<p>　　Now while they hesitated, a soft delicious harmony of female voicessuddenly rose, and seemed to come and run round the walls. The menlooked at one another in astonishment; for the effect was magical.</p> 
<p>　　The staircase being enclosed on all sides with stone walls andfloored with stone, they were like flies inside a violoncello; thevoices rang above, below, and on every side of the vibrating walls.</p> 
<p>　　In some epochs spirits as hardy as Raynal's, and wits as quick asRiviere's, would have fled then and there to the nearest public, andtold over cups how they had heard the dames of Beaurepaire, longsince dead, holding their revel, and the conscious old devil's nestof a chateau quivering to the ghostly strains.</p> 
<p>　　But this was an incredulous age. They listened, and listened, anddecided the sounds came from up-stairs.</p> 
<p>　　"Let us mount, and surprise these singing witches," said Edouard.</p> 
<p>　　"Surprise them! what for? It is not the enemy--for once. What isthe good of surprising our friends?"Storming parties and surprises were no novelty and therefore notreat to Raynal.</p> 
<p>　　"It will be so delightful to see their faces at first sight of you.</p> 
<p>　　O colonel, for my sake! Don't spoil it by going tamely in at thefront door, after coming at night from Egypt for half an hour."Raynal grumbled something about its being a childish trick; but toplease Edouard consented at last; only stipulated for a light: "orelse," said he, "we shall surprise ourselves instead with a brokenneck, going over ground we don't know to surprise the natives--ourskirmishers got nicked that way now and then in Egypt.""Yes, colonel, I will go first with Jacintha's candle." Edouardmounted the stairs on tiptoe. Raynal followed. The solid stonesteps did not prate. The men had mounted a considerable way, whenpuff a blast of wind came through a hole, and out went Edouard'scandle. He turned sharply round to Raynal. "Peste!" said he in avicious whisper. But the other laid his hand on his shoulder andwhispered, "Look to the front." He looked, and, his own candlebeing out, saw a glimmer on ahead. He crept towards it. It was ataper shooting a feeble light across a small aperture. They caughta glimpse of what seemed to be a small apartment. Yet Edouardrecognized the carpet of the tapestried room--which was a very largeroom. Creeping a yard nearer, he discovered that it was thetapestried room, and that what had seemed the further wall was onlythe screen, behind which were lights, and two women singing a duet.</p> 
<p>　　He whispered to Raynal, "It is the tapestried room.""Is it a sitting-room?" whispered Raynal.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes! yes! Mind and not knock your foot against the wood."And Raynal went softly up and put his foot quietly through theaperture, which he now saw was made by a panel drawn back close tothe ground; and stood in the tapestried chamber. The carpet wasthick; the voices favored the stealthy advance; the floor of the oldhouse was like a rock; and Edouard put his face through theaperture, glowing all over with anticipation of the little scream ofjoy that would welcome his friend dropping in so nice and suddenlyfrom Egypt.</p> 
<p>　　The feeling was rendered still more piquant by a sharp curiositythat had been growing on him for some minutes past. For why wasthis passage opened to-night?--he had never seen it opened before.</p> 
<p>　　And why was Jacintha lying sentinel at the foot of the stairs?</p> 
<p>　　But this was not all. Now that they were in the room both menbecame conscious of another sound besides the ladies' voices--a verypeculiar sound. It also came from behind the screen. They bothheard it, and showed, by the puzzled looks they cast at one another,that neither could make out what on earth it was. It consisted of asuccession of little rustles, followed by little thumps on thefloor.</p> 
<p>　　But what was curious, too, this rustle, thump--rustle, thump--fellexactly into the time of the music; so that, clearly, either therustle thump was being played to the tune, or the tune sung to therustle thump.</p> 
<p>　　This last touch of mystery inflamed Edouard's impatience beyondbearing: he pointed eagerly and merrily to the corner of the screen.</p> 
<p>　　Raynal obeyed, and stepped very slowly and cautiously towards it.</p> 
<p>　　Rustle, thump! rustle, thump! rustle, thump! with the rhythm ofharmonious voices.</p> 
<p>　　Edouard got his head and foot into the room without taking his eyeoff Raynal.</p> 
<p>　　Rustle, thump! rustle, thump! rustle, thump!</p> 
<p>　　Raynal was now at the screen, and quietly put his head round it, andhis hand upon it.</p> 
<p>　　Edouard was bursting with expectation.</p> 
<p>　　No result. What is this? Don't they see him? Why does he notspeak to them? He seems transfixed.</p> 
<p>　　Rustle, thump! rustle, thump; accompanied now for a few notes by onevoice only, Rose's.</p> 
<p>　　Suddenly there burst a shriek from Josephine, so loud, so fearful,that it made even Raynal stagger back a step, the screen in hishand.</p> 
<p>　　Then another scream of terror and anguish from Rose. Then a faintercry, and the heavy helpless fall of a human body.</p> 
<p>　　Raynal sprang forward whirling the screen to the earth in terribleagitation, and Edouard bounded over it as it fell at his feet. Hedid not take a second step. The scene that caught his eye stupefiedand paralyzed him in full career, and froze him to the spot withamazement and strange misgivings.</p>
