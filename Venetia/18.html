When we are young, we think that not only ourselves, but that all about us, are immortal. Until the arrow has struck a victim round our own hearth, death is merely an unmeaning word; until then, its casual mention has stamped no idea upon our brain. There are few, even among those least susceptible of thought and emotion, in whose hearts and minds the first death in the family does not act as a powerful revelation of the mysteries of life, and of their own being; there are few who, after such a catastrophe, do not look upon the world and the world’s ways, at least for a time, with changed and tempered feelings. It recalls the past; it makes us ponder over the future; and youth, gay and light-hearted youth, is taught, for the first time, to regret and to fear.
<br> 
<br> On Cadurcis, a child of pensive temperament, and in whose strange and yet undeveloped character there was, amid lighter elements, a constitutional principle of melancholy, the sudden decease of his mother produced a profound effect. All was forgotten of his parent, except the intimate and natural tie, and her warm and genuine affection. He was now alone in the world; for reflection impressed upon him at this moment what the course of existence too generally teaches to us all, that mournful truth, that, after all, we have no friends that we can depend upon in this life but our parents. All other intimacies, however ardent, are liable to cool; all other confidence, however unlimited, to be violated. In the phantasmagoria of life, the friend with whom we have cultivated mutual trust for years is often suddenly or gradually estranged from us, or becomes, from, painful, yet irresistible circumstances, even our deadliest foe. As for women, as for the mistresses of our hearts, who has not learnt that the links of passion are fragile as they are glittering; and that the bosom on which we have reposed with idolatry all our secret sorrows and sanguine hopes, eventually becomes the very heart that exults in our misery and baffles our welfare? Where is the enamoured face that smiled upon our early love, and was to shed tears over our grave? Where are the choice companions of our youth, with whom we were to breast the difficulties and share the triumphs of existence? Even in this inconstant world, what changes like the heart? Love is a dream, and friendship a delusion. No wonder we grow callous; for how few have the opportunity of returning to the hearth which they quitted in levity or thoughtless weariness, yet which alone is faithful to them; whose sweet affections require not the stimulus of prosperity or fame, the lure of accomplishments, or the tribute of flattery; but which are constant to us in distress, and console us even in disgrace!
<br> 
<br> Before she retired for the night, Lady Annabel was anxious to see Plantagenet. Mistress Pauncefort had informed her of his visit to his mother’s room. Lady Annabel found Cadurcis in the gallery, now partially lighted by the moon which had recently risen. She entered with her light, as if she were on her way to her own room, and not seeking him.
<br> 
<br> ‘Dear Plantagenet,’ she said, ‘will you not go to bed?’
<br> 
<br> ‘I do not intend to go to bed to-night,’ he replied.
<br> 
<br> She approached him and took him by the hand, which he did not withdraw from her, and they walked together once or twice up and down the gallery.
<br> 
<br> ‘I think, dear child,’ said Lady Annabel, ‘you had better come and sit with us.’
<br> 
<br> ‘I like to be alone,’ was his answer; but not in a sullen voice, low and faltering.
<br> 
<br> ‘But in sorrow we should be with our friends,’ said Lady Annabel.
<br> 
<br> ‘I have no friends,’ he answered. ‘I only had one.’
<br> 
<br> ‘I am your friend, dear child; I am your mother now, and you shall find me one if you like. And Venetia, have you forgotten your sister? Is she not your friend? And Dr. Masham, surely you cannot doubt his friendship?’
<br> 
<br> Cadurcis tried to stifle a sob. ‘Ay, Lady Annabel,’ he said, ‘you are my friend now, and so are you all; and you know I love you much. But you were not my friends two years ago; and things will change again; they will, indeed. A mother is your friend as long as she lives; she cannot help being your friend.’
<br> 
<br> ‘You shall come to Cherbury and live with us,’ said Lady Annabel.’ You know you love Cherbury, and you shall find it a home, a real home.’
<br> 
<br> He pressed her hand to his lips; the hand was covered with his tears.
<br> 
<br> ‘We will go to Cherbury tomorrow, dear Plantagenet; remaining here will only make you sad.’
<br> 
<br> ‘I will never leave Cadurcis again while my mother is in this house,’ he said, in a firm and serious voice. And then, after a moment’s pause, he added, ‘I wish to know when the burial is to take place.’
<br> 
<br> ‘We will ask Dr. Masham,’ replied Lady Annabel. ‘Come, let us go to him; come, my own child.’
<br> 
<br> He permitted himself to be led away. They descended to the small apartment where Lady Annabel had been previously sitting. They found the Doctor there; he rose and pressed Plantagenet’s hand with great emotion. They made room for him at the fire between them; he sat in silence, with his gaze intently fixed upon the decaying embers, yet did not quit his hold of Lady Annabel’s hand. He found it a consolation to him; it linked him to a being who seemed to love him. As long as he held her hand he did not seem quite alone in the world.
<br> 
<br> Now nobody spoke; for Lady Annabel felt that Cadurcis was in some degree solaced; and she thought it unwise to interrupt the more composed train of his thoughts. It was, indeed, Plantagenet himself who first broke silence.
<br> 
<br> ‘I do not think I can go to bed, Lady Annabel,’ he said. ‘The thought of this night is terrible to me. I do not think it ever can end. I would much sooner sit up in this room.’
<br> 
<br> ‘Nay! my child, sleep is a great consoler; try to go to bed, love.’
<br> 
<br> ‘I should like to sleep in my mother’s room,’ was his strange reply. ‘It seems to me that I could sleep there. And if I woke in the night, I should like to see her.’
<br> 
<br> Lady Annabel and the Doctor exchanged looks.
<br> 
<br> ‘I think,’ said the Doctor, ‘you had better sleep in my room, and then, if you wake in the night, you will have some one to speak to. You will find that a comfort.’
<br> 
<br> ‘Yes, that you will,’ said Lady Annabel. ‘I will go and have the sofa bed made up in the Doctor’s room for you. Indeed that will be the very best plan.’
<br> 
<br> So at last, but not without a struggle, they persuaded Cadurcis to retire. Lady Annabel embraced him tenderly when she bade him good night; and, indeed, he felt consoled by her affection.
<br> 
<br> As nothing could persuade Plantagenet to leave the abbey until his mother was buried, Lady Annabel resolved to take up her abode there, and she sent the next morning for Venetia. There were a great many arrangements to make about the burial and the mourning; and Lady Annabel and Dr. Masham were obliged, in consequence, to go the next morning to Southport; but they delayed their departure until the arrival of Venetia, that Cadurcis might not be left alone.
<br> 
<br> The meeting between himself and Venetia was a very sad one, and yet her companionship was a great solace. Venetia urged every topic that she fancied could reassure his spirits, and upon the happy home he would find at Cherbury.
<br> 
<br> ‘Ah!’ said Cadurcis, ‘they will not leave me here; I am sure of that. I think our happy days are over, Venetia.’
<br> 
<br> What mourner has not felt the magic of time? Before the funeral could take place, Cadurcis had recovered somewhat of his usual cheerfulness, and would indulge with Venetia in plans of their future life. And living, as they all were, under the same roof, sharing the same sorrows, participating in the same cares, and all about to wear the same mournful emblems of their domestic calamity, it was difficult for him to believe that he was indeed that desolate being he had at first correctly estimated himself. Here were true friends, if such could exist; here were fine sympathies, pure affections, innocent and disinterested hearts! Every domestic tie yet remained perfect, except the spell-bound tie of blood. That wanting, all was a bright and happy vision, that might vanish in an instant, and for ever; that perfect, even the least graceful, the most repulsive home, had its irresistible charms; and its loss, when once experienced, might be mourned for ever, and could never be restored.
