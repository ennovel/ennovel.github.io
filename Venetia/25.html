He is at length discovered. It was, then, an irresistible destiny that, after the wild musings and baffled aspirations of so many years, had guided her to this chamber. She is the child of Marmion Herbert; she beholds her lost parent. That being of supernatural beauty, on whom she gazes with a look of blended reverence and love, is her father. What a revelation! Its reality exceeded the wildest dreams of her romance; her brightest visions of grace and loveliness and genius seemed personified in this form; the form of one to whom she was bound by the strongest of all earthly ties, of one on whose heart she had a claim second only to that of the being by whose lips his name was never mentioned. Was he, then, no more? Ah! could she doubt that bitterest calamity? Ah! was it, was it any longer a marvel, that one who had lived in the light of those seraphic eyes, and had watched them until their terrestrial splendour had been for ever extinguished, should shrink from the converse that could remind her of the catastrophe of all her earthly hopes! This chamber, then, was the temple of her mother’s woe, the tomb of her baffled affections and bleeding heart. No wonder that Lady Annabel, the desolate Lady Annabel, that almost the same spring must have witnessed the most favoured and the most disconsolate of women, should have fled from the world that had awarded her at the same time a lot so dazzling and so full of despair. Venetia felt that the existence of her mother’s child, her own fragile being, could have been that mother’s sole link to life. The heart of the young widow of Marmion Herbert must have broken but for Venetia; and the consciousness of that remaining tie, and the duties that it involved, could alone have sustained the victim under a lot of such unparalleled bitterness. The tears streamed down her cheek as she thought of her mother’s misery, and her mother’s gentle love; the misery that she had been so cautious her child should never share; the vigilant affection that, with all her own hopes blighted, had still laboured to compensate to her child for a deprivation the fulness of which Venetia could only now comprehend.
<br> 
<br> When, where, why did he die? Oh that she might talk of him to her mother for ever! It seemed that life might pass away in listening to his praises. Marmion Herbert! and who was Marmion Herbert? Young as he was, command and genius, the pride of noble passions, all the glory of a creative mind, seemed stamped upon his brow. With all his marvellous beauty, he seemed a being born for greatness. Dead! in the very burst of his spring, a spring so sweet and splendid; could he be dead? Why, then, was he ever born? It seemed to her that he could not be dead; there was an animated look about the form, that seemed as if it could not die without leaving mankind a prodigal legacy of fame.
<br> 
<br> Venetia turned and looked upon her parents’ bridal bed. Now that she had discovered her father’s portrait, every article in the room interested her, for her imagination connected everything with him. She touched the wreath of withered roses, and one instantly broke away from the circle, and fell; she knelt down, and gathered up the scattered leaves, and placed them in her bosom. She approached the table in the oriel: in its centre was a volume, on which reposed a dagger of curious workmanship; the volume bound in velvet, and the word ‘ANNABEL’ embroidered upon it in gold. Venetia unclasped it. The volume was his; in a fly-leaf were written these words:
<br> 
<br> ‘TO THE LADY OF MY LOVE, FROM HER MARMION HERBERT.’
<br> 
<br> With a fluttering heart, yet sparkling eye, Venetia sank into a chair, which was placed before the table, with all her soul concentred in the contents of this volume. Leaning on her right hand, which shaded her agitated brow, she turned a page of the volume with a trembling hand. It contained a sonnet, delineating the feelings of a lover at the first sight of his beloved, a being to him yet unknown. Venetia perused with breathless interest the graceful and passionate picture of her mother’s beauty. A series of similar compositions detailed the history of the poet’s heart, and all the thrilling adventures of his enchanted life. Not an incident, not a word, not a glance, in that spell-bound prime of existence, that was not commemorated by his lyre in strains as sweet and as witching! Now he poured forth his passion; now his doubts; now his hopes; now came the glowing hour when he was first assured of his felicity; the next page celebrated her visit to the castle of his fathers; and another led her to the altar.
<br> 
<br> With a flushed cheek and an excited eye, Venetia had rapidly pored over these ardent annals of the heart from whose blood she had sprung. She turns the page; she starts; the colour deserts her countenance; a mist glides over her vision; she clasps her hands with convulsive energy; she sinks back in her chair. In a few moments she extends one hand, as if fearful again to touch the book that had excited so much emotion, raises herself in her seat, looks around her with a vacant and perplexed gaze, apparently succeeds in collecting herself, and then seizes, with an eager grasp, the volume, and throwing herself on her, knees before the chair, her long locks hanging on each side over a cheek crimson as the sunset, loses her whole soul in the lines which the next page reveals.
<br> ON THE NIGHT OUR DAUGHTER WAS BORN.
<br> i.
<br> 
<br> Within our heaven of love, the new-born star
<br> 
<br> We long devoutly watched, like shepherd kings,
<br> 
<br> Steals into light, and, floating from afar,
<br> 
<br> Methinks some bright transcendent seraph sings,
<br> 
<br> Waving with flashing light her radiant wings,
<br> 
<br> Immortal welcome to the stranger fair:
<br> 
<br> To us a child is born. With transport clings
<br> 
<br> The mother to the babe she sighed to bear;
<br> 
<br> Of all our treasured loves the long-expected heir!
<br> ii.
<br> 
<br> My daughter! can it be a daughter now
<br> 
<br> Shall greet my being with her infant smile?
<br> 
<br> And shall I press that fair and taintless brow
<br> 
<br> With my fond lips, and tempt, with many a wile
<br> 
<br> Of playful love, those features to beguile
<br> 
<br> A parent with their mirth? In the wild sea
<br> 
<br> Of this dark life, behold a little isle
<br> 
<br> Rises amid the waters, bright and free,
<br> 
<br> A haven for my hopes of fond security!
<br> iii.
<br> 
<br> And thou shalt bear a name my line has loved,
<br> 
<br> And their fair daughters owned for many an age,
<br> 
<br> Since first our fiery blood a wanderer roved,
<br> 
<br> And made in sunnier lands his pilgrimage,
<br> 
<br> Where proud defiance with the waters wage
<br> 
<br> The sea-born city’s walls; the graceful towers
<br> 
<br> Loved by the bard and honoured by the sage!
<br> 
<br> My own VENETIA now shall gild our bowers,
<br> 
<br> And with her spell enchain our life’s enchanted hours!
<br> iv.
<br> 
<br> Oh! if the blessing of a father’s heart
<br> 
<br> Hath aught of sacred in its deep-breath’d prayer,
<br> 
<br> Skilled to thy gentle being to impart,
<br> 
<br> As thy bright form itself, a fate as fair;
<br> 
<br> On thee I breathe that blessing! Let me share,
<br> 
<br> O God! her joys; and if the dark behest
<br> 
<br> Of woe resistless, and avoidless care,
<br> 
<br> Hath, not gone forth, oh! spare this gentle guest.
<br> 
<br> And wreak thy needful wrath on my resigned breast!
<br> 
<br> An hour elapsed, and Venetia did not move. Over and over again she conned the only address from the lips of her father that had ever reached her ear. A strange inspiration seconded the exertion of an exercised memory. The duty was fulfilled, the task completed. Then a sound was heard without. The thought that her mother had returned occurred to her; she looked up, the big tears streaming down her face; she listened, like a young hind just roused by the still-distant huntsman, quivering and wild: she listened, and she sprang up, replaced the volume, arranged the chair, cast one long, lingering, feverish glance at the portrait, skimmed through the room, hesitated one moment in the ante-chamber; opened, as all was silent, the no longer mysterious door, turned the noiseless lock, tripped lightly along the vestibule; glided into her mother’s empty apartment, reposited the key that had opened so many wonders in the casket; and, then, having hurried to her own chamber, threw herself on her bed in a paroxysm of contending emotions, that left her no power of pondering over the strange discovery that had already given a new colour to her existence.
