After dinner they were glad to cluster round the large fire in the green drawing-room. Dr. Masham had promised to read the evening service in the chapel, which was now lit up, and the bell was sounding, that the cottagers might have the opportunity of attending.
<br> 
<br> Plantagenet and Venetia followed the elders to the chapel; they walked hand-inhand down the long galleries.
<br> 
<br> ‘I should like to go all over this house,’ said Plantagenet to his companion. ‘Have you ever been?’
<br> 
<br> ‘Never,’ said Venetia; ‘half of it is shut up. Nobody ever goes into it, except mamma.’
<br> 
<br> In the night there was a violent snowstorm; not only was the fall extremely heavy, but the wind was so high, that it carried the snow off the hills, and all the roads were blocked up, in many places ten or twelve feet deep. All communication was stopped. This was an adventure that amused the children, though the rest looked rather grave. Plantagenet expressed to Venetia his wish that the snow would never melt, and that they might remain at Cherbury for ever.
<br> 
<br> The children were to have a holiday this week, and they had planned some excursions in the park and neighbourhood, but now they were all prisoners to the house. They wandered about, turning the staircase into mountains, the great hall into an ocean, and the different rooms into so many various regions. They amused themselves with their adventures, and went on endless voyages of discovery. Every moment Plantagenet longed still more for the opportunity of exploring the uninhabited chambers; but Venetia shook her head, because she was sure Lady Annabel would not grant them permission.
<br> 
<br> ‘Did you ever live at any place before you came to Cherbury?’ inquired Lord Cadurcis of Venetia.
<br> 
<br> ‘I know I was not born here,’ said Venetia; ‘but I was so young that I have no recollection of any other place.’
<br> 
<br> ‘And did any one live here before you came?’ said Plantagenet.
<br> 
<br> ‘I do not know,’ said Venetia; ‘I never heard if anybody did. I, I,’ she continued, a little constrained, ‘I know nothing.’
<br> 
<br> ‘Do you remember your papa?’ said Plantagenet.
<br> 
<br> ‘No,’ said Venetia.
<br> 
<br> ‘Then he must have died almost as soon as you were born, said Lord Cadurcis.
<br> 
<br> ‘I suppose he must,’ said Venetia, and her heart trembled.
<br> 
<br> ‘I wonder if he ever lived here!’ said Plantagenet.
<br> 
<br> ‘Mamma does not like me to ask questions about my papa,’ said Venetia, ‘and I cannot tell you anything.’
<br> 
<br> ‘Ah! your papa was different from mine, Venetia,’ said Cadurcis; ‘my mother talks of him often enough. They did not agree very well; and, when we quarrel, she always says I remind her of him. I dare say Lady Annabel loved your papa very much.’
<br> 
<br> ‘I am sure mamma did,’ replied Venetia.
<br> 
<br> The children returned to the drawing-room, and joined their friends: Mrs. Cadurcis was sitting on the sofa, occasionally dozing over a sermon; Dr. Masham was standing with Lady Annabel in the recess of a distant window. Her ladyship’s countenance was averted; she was reading a newspaper, which the Doctor had given her. As the door opened, Lady Annabel glanced round; her countenance was agitated; she folded up the newspaper rather hastily, and gave it to the Doctor.
<br> 
<br> ‘And what have you been doing, little folks?’ inquired the Doctor of the new comers.
<br> 
<br> ‘We have been playing at the history of Rome,’ said Venetia, ‘and now that we have conquered every place, we do not know what to do.’
<br> 
<br> ‘The usual result of conquest,’ said the Doctor, smiling.
<br> 
<br> ‘This snowstorm is a great trial for you; I begin to believe that, after all, you would be more pleased to take your holidays at another opportunity.’
<br> 
<br> ‘We could amuse ourselves very well,’ said Plantagenet, ‘if Lady Annabel would be so kind as to permit us to explore the part of the house that is shut up.’
<br> 
<br> ‘That would be a strange mode of diversion,’ said Lady Annabel, quietly, ‘and I do not think by any means a suitable one. There cannot be much amusement in roaming over a number of dusty unfurnished rooms.’
<br> 
<br> ‘And so nicely dressed as you are too!’ said Mrs. Cadurcis, rousing herself: ‘I wonder how such an idea could enter your head!’
<br> 
<br> ‘It snows harder than ever,’ said Venetia; ‘I think, after all, I shall learn my French vocabulary.’
<br> 
<br> ‘If it snows tomorrow,’ said Plantagenet, ‘we will do our lessons as usual. Holidays, I find, are not so amusing as I supposed.’
<br> 
<br> The snow did continue, and the next day the children voluntarily suggested that they should resume their usual course of life. With their mornings occupied, they found their sources of relaxation ample; and in the evening they acted plays, and Lady Annabel dressed them up in her shawls, and Dr. Masham read Shakspeare to them.
<br> 
<br> It was about the fourth day of the visit that Plantagenet, loitering in the hall with Venetia, said to her, ‘I saw your mamma go into the locked-up rooms last night. I do so wish that she would let us go there.’
<br> 
<br> ‘Last night!’ said Venetia; ‘when could you have seen her last night?’
<br> 
<br> ‘Very late: the fact is, I could not sleep, and I took it into my head to walk up and down the gallery. I often do so at the abbey. I like to walk up and down an old gallery alone at night. I do not know why; but I like it very much. Everything is so still, and then you hear the owls. I cannot make out why it is; but nothing gives me more pleasure than to get up when everybody is asleep. It seems as if one were the only living person in the world. I sometimes think, when I am a man, I will always get up in the night, and go to bed in the daytime. Is not that odd?’
<br> 
<br> ‘But mamma!’ said Venetia, ‘how came you to see mamma?’
<br> 
<br> ‘Oh! I am certain of it,’ said the boy; ‘for, to tell you the truth, I was rather frightened at first; only I thought it would not do for a Cadurcis to be afraid, so I stood against the wall, in the shade, and I was determined, whatever happened, not to cry out.’
<br> 
<br> ‘Oh! you frighten me so, Plantagenet!’ said Venetia.
<br> 
<br> ‘Ah! you might well have been frightened if you had been there; past midnight, a tall white figure, and a light! However, there is nothing to be alarmed about; it was Lady Annabel, nobody else. I saw her as clearly as I see you now. She walked along the gallery, and went to the very door you showed me the other morning. I marked the door; I could not mistake it. She unlocked it, and she went in.’
<br> 
<br> ‘And then?’ inquired Venetia, eagerly.
<br> 
<br> ‘Why, then, like a fool, I went back to bed,’ said Plantagenet. ‘I thought it would seem so silly if I were caught, and I might not have had the good fortune to escape twice. I know no more.’
<br> 
<br> Venetia could not reply. She heard a laugh, and then her mother’s voice. They were called with a gay summons to see a colossal snow-ball, that some of the younger servants had made and rolled to the window of the terrace-room. It was ornamented with a crown of holly and mistletoe, and the parti-coloured berries looked bright in a straggling sunbeam which had fought its way through the still-loaded sky, and fell upon the terrace.
<br> 
<br> In the evening, as they sat round the fire, Mrs. Cadurcis began telling Venetia a long rambling ghost story, which she declared was a real ghost story, and had happened in her own family. Such communications were not very pleasing to Lady Annabel, but she was too well bred to interrupt her guest. When, however, the narrative was finished, and Venetia, by her observations, evidently indicated the effect that it had produced upon her mind, her mother took the occasion of impressing upon her the little credibility which should be attached to such legends, and the rational process by which many unquestionable apparitions might be accounted for. Dr. Masham, following this train, recounted a story of a ghost which had been generally received in a neighbouring village for a considerable period, and attested by the most veracious witnesses, but which was explained afterwards by turning out to be an instance of somnambulism. Venetia appeared to be extremely interested in the subject; she inquired much about sleep-walkers and sleepwalking; and a great many examples of the habit were cited. At length she said, ‘Mamma, did you ever walk in your sleep?’
<br> 
<br> ‘Not to my knowledge,’ said Lady Annabel, smiling; ‘I should hope not.’
<br> 
<br> ‘Well, do you know,’ said Plantagenet, who had hitherto listened in silence, ‘it is very curious, but I once dreamt that you did, Lady Annabel.’
<br> 
<br> ‘Indeed!’ said the lady.
<br> 
<br> ‘Yes! and I dreamt it last night, too,’ continued Cadurcis. ‘I thought I was sleeping in the uninhabited rooms here, and the door opened, and you walked in with a light.’
<br> 
<br> ‘No! Plantagenet,’ said Venetia, who was seated by him, and who spoke in a whisper, ‘it was not —’
<br> 
<br> ‘Hush!’ said Cadurcis, in a low voice.
<br> 
<br> ‘Well, that was a strange dream,’ said Mrs. Cadurcis; ‘was it not, Doctor?’
<br> 
<br> ‘Now, children, I will tell you a very curious story,’ said the Doctor; ‘and it is quite a true one, for it happened to myself.’
<br> 
<br> The Doctor was soon embarked in his tale, and his audience speedily became interested in the narrative; but Lady Annabel for some time maintained complete silence.
