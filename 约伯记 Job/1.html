<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. He was without sin and upright, fearing God and keeping himself far from evil.
<br>1:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 生 了 七 个 儿 子 ， 三 个 女 儿 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he had seven sons and three daughters.
<br>1:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 的 家 产 有 七 千 羊 ， 三 千 骆 驼 ， 五 百 对 牛 ， 五 百 母 驴 ， 并 有 许 多 仆 婢 。 这 人 在 东 方 人 中 就 为 至 大 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And of cattle he had seven thousand sheep and goats, and three thousand camels, and a thousand oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great number of servants. And the man was greater than any of the sons of the east.
<br>1:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 的 儿 子 ， 按 着 日 子 ， 各 在 自 己 家 里 设 摆 筵 宴 ， 就 打 发 人 去 ， 请 了 他 们 的 三 个 姐 妹 来 ， 与 他 们 一 同 吃 喝 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;His sons regularly went to one another's houses, and every one on his day gave a feast: and at these times they sent for their three sisters to take part in their feasts with them.
<br>1:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;筵 宴 的 日 子 过 了 ， 约 伯 打 发 人 去 叫 他 们 自 洁 。 他 清 早 起 来 ， 按 着 他 们 众 人 的 数 目 献 燔 祭 。 因 为 他 说 ， 恐 怕 我 儿 子 犯 了 罪 ， 心 中 弃 掉 神 。 约 伯 常 常 这 样 行 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And at the end of their days of feasting, Job sent and made them clean, getting up early in the morning and offering burned offerings for them all. For, Job said, It may be that my sons have done wrong and said evil of God in their hearts. And Job did this whenever the feasts came round.
<br>1:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 一 天 ， 神 的 众 子 ， 来 侍 立 在 耶 和 华 面 前 ， 撒 但 也 来 在 其 中 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And there was a day when the sons of the gods came together before the Lord, and the Satan came with them.
<br>1:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 和 华 问 撒 但 说 ， 你 从 哪 里 来 ？ 撒 但 回 答 说 ， 我 从 地 上 走 来 走 去 ， 往 返 而 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the Lord said to the Satan, Where do you come from? And the Satan said in answer, From wandering this way and that on the earth, and walking about on it.
<br>1:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 和 华 问 撒 但 说 ， 你 曾 用 心 察 看 我 的 仆 人 约 伯 没 有 。 地 上 再 没 有 人 像 他 完 全 正 直 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 远 离 恶 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the Lord said to the Satan, Have you taken note of my servant Job, for there is no one like him on the earth, a man without sin and upright, fearing God and keeping himself far from evil?
<br>1:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;撒 但 回 答 耶 和 华 说 ， 约 伯 敬 畏 神 ， 岂 是 无 故 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the Satan said in answer to the Lord, Is it for nothing that Job is a god-fearing man?
<br>1:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 岂 不 是 四 面 圈 上 篱 笆 ， 围 护 他 和 他 的 家 ， 并 他 一 切 所 有 的 吗 ？ 他 手 所 做 的 都 蒙 你 赐 福 。 他 的 家 产 也 在 地 上 增 多 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Have you yourself not put a wall round him and his house and all he has on every side, blessing the work of his hands, and increasing his cattle in the land?
<br>1:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 且 伸 手 毁 他 一 切 所 有 的 。 他 必 当 面 弃 掉 你 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But now, put out your hand against all he has, and he will be cursing you to your face.
<br>1:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 和 华 对 撒 但 说 ， 凡 他 所 有 的 都 在 你 手 中 。 只 是 不 可 伸 手 加 害 于 他 。 于 是 撒 但 从 耶 和 华 面 前 退 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the Lord said to the Satan, See, I give all he has into your hands, only do not put a finger on the man himself. And the Satan went out from before the Lord.
<br>1:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 一 天 ， 约 伯 的 儿 女 正 在 他 们 长 兄 的 家 里 ， 吃 饭 喝 酒 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And there was a day when his sons and daughters were feasting in the house of their oldest brother,
<br>1:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 报 信 的 来 见 约 伯 ， 说 ， 牛 正 耕 地 ， 驴 在 旁 边 吃 草 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And a man came to Job, and said, The oxen were ploughing, and the asses were taking their food by their side:
<br>1:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;示 巴 人 忽 然 闯 来 ， 把 牲 畜 掳 去 ， 并 用 刀 杀 了 仆 人 。 惟 有 我 一 人 逃 脱 ， 来 报 信 给 你 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the men of Sheba came against them and took them away, putting the young men to the sword, and I was the only one who got away safe to give you the news.
<br>1:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 还 说 话 的 时 候 ， 又 有 人 来 说 ， 神 从 天 上 降 下 火 来 ， 将 群 羊 和 仆 人 都 烧 灭 了 。 惟 有 我 一 人 逃 脱 ， 来 报 信 给 你 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And this one was still talking when another came, and said, The fire of God came down from heaven, burning up the sheep and the goats and the young men completely, and I was the only one who got away safe to give you the news.
<br>1:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 还 说 话 的 时 候 ， 又 有 人 来 说 ， 迦 勒 底 人 分 作 三 队 忽 然 闯 来 ， 把 骆 驼 掳 去 ， 并 用 刀 杀 了 仆 人 。 惟 有 我 一 人 逃 脱 ， 来 报 信 给 你 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And this one was still talking when another came, and said, The Chaldaeans made themselves into three bands, and came down on the camels and took them away, putting the young men to the sword, and I was the only one who got away safe to give you the news.
<br>1:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 还 说 话 的 时 候 ， 又 有 人 来 说 ， 你 的 儿 女 正 在 他 们 长 兄 的 家 里 吃 饭 喝 酒 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And this one was still talking when another came, and said, Your sons and your daughters were feasting together in their oldest brother's house,
<br>1:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;不 料 ， 有 狂 风 从 旷 野 刮 来 ， 击 打 房 屋 的 四 角 ， 房 屋 倒 塌 在 少 年 人 身 上 ， 他 们 就 都 死 了 。 惟 有 我 一 人 逃 脱 ， 来 报 信 给 你 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;When a great wind came rushing from the waste land against the four sides of the house, and it came down on the young men, and they are dead; and I was the only one who got away safe to give you the news.
<br>1:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;约 伯 便 起 来 ， 撕 裂 外 袍 ， 剃 了 头 ， 伏 在 地 上 下 拜 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Job got up, and after parting his clothing and cutting off his hair, he went down on his face to the earth, and gave worship, and said,
<br>1:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;说 ， 我 赤 身 出 于 母 胎 ， 也 必 赤 身 归 回 。 赏 赐 的 是 耶 和 华 ， 收 取 的 也 是 耶 和 华 。 耶 和 华 的 名 是 应 当 称 颂 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;With nothing I came out of my mother's body, and with nothing I will go back there; the Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; let the Lord's name be praised.
<br>1:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 这 一 切 的 事 上 约 伯 并 不 犯 罪 ， 也 不 以 神 为 愚 妄 （ 或 作 也 不 妄 评 神 ） 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;In all this Job did no sin, and did not say that God's acts were foolish.
