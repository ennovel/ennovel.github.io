<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But Job answered and said,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Job made answer and said,
<br>21:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 要 细 听 我 的 言 语 ， 就 算 是 你 们 安 慰 我 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Give attention with care to my words; and let this be your comfort.
<br>21:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;请 宽 容 我 ， 我 又 要 说 话 。 说 了 以 后 ， 任 凭 你 们 嗤 笑 吧 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Let me say what is in my mind, and after that, go on making sport of me.
<br>21:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 岂 是 向 人 诉 冤 ， 为 何 不 焦 急 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;As for me, is my outcry against man? is it then to be wondered at if my spirit is troubled?
<br>21:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 要 看 着 我 而 惊 奇 ， 用 手 捂 口 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Take note of me and be full of wonder, put your hand on your mouth.
<br>21:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 每 逢 思 想 ， 心 就 惊 惶 ， 浑 身 战 兢 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;At the very thought of it my flesh is shaking with fear.
<br>21:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;恶 人 为 何 存 活 ， 享 大 寿 数 ， 势 力 强 盛 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Why is life given to the evil-doers? why do they become old and strong in power?
<br>21:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 眼 见 儿 孙 ， 和 他 们 一 同 坚 立 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Their children are ever with them, and their offspring before their eyes.
<br>21:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 的 家 宅 平 安 无 惧 。 神 的 杖 也 不 加 在 他 们 身 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Their houses are free from fear, and the rod of God does not come on them.
<br>21:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 的 公 牛 孳 生 而 不 断 绝 。 母 牛 下 犊 而 不 掉 胎 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Their ox is ready at all times to give seed; their cow gives birth, without dropping her young.
<br>21:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 打 发 小 孩 子 出 去 ， 多 如 羊 群 。 他 们 的 儿 女 踊 跃 跳 舞 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;They send out their young ones like a flock, and their children have pleasure in the dance,
<br>21:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 随 着 琴 鼓 歌 唱 ， 又 因 箫 声 欢 喜 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;They make songs to the instruments of music, and are glad at the sound of the pipe.
<br>21:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 度 日 诸 事 亨 通 ， 转 眼 下 入 阴 间 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Their days come to an end without trouble, and suddenly they go down to the underworld.
<br>21:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 对 神 说 ， 离 开 我 们 吧 。 我 们 不 愿 晓 得 你 的 道 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Though they said to God, Go away from us, for we have no desire for the knowledge of your ways.
<br>21:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;全 能 者 是 谁 ， 我 们 何 必 事 奉 他 呢 ？ 求 告 他 有 什 么 益 处 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;What is the Ruler of all, that we may give him worship? and what profit is it to us to make prayer to him?
<br>21:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;看 哪 ， 他 们 亨 通 不 在 乎 自 己 。 恶 人 所 谋 定 的 离 我 好 远 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Truly, is not their well-being in their power? (The purpose of the evil-doers is far from me.)
<br>21:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;恶 人 的 灯 何 尝 熄 灭 。 患 难 何 尝 临 到 他 们 呢 ？ 神 何 尝 发 怒 ， 向 他 们 分 散 灾 祸 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;How frequently is the light of the evil-doers put out, or does trouble come on them? how frequently does his wrath take them with cords?
<br>21:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 何 尝 像 风 前 的 碎 秸 ， 如 暴 风 刮 去 的 糠 秕 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;How frequently are they as dry stems before the wind, or as grass taken away by the storm-wind?
<br>21:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 说 ， 神 为 恶 人 的 儿 女 积 蓄 罪 孽 。 我 说 ， 不 如 本 人 受 报 ， 好 使 他 亲 自 知 道 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;You say, God keeps punishment stored up for his children. Let him send it on the man himself, so that he may have the punishment of it!
<br>21:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;愿 他 亲 眼 看 见 自 己 败 亡 ， 亲 自 饮 全 能 者 的 忿 怒 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Let his eyes see his trouble, and let him be full of the wrath of the Ruler of all!
<br>21:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 的 岁 月 既 尽 ， 他 还 顾 他 本 家 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For what interest has he in his house after him, when the number of his months is ended?
<br>21:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;神 既 审 判 那 在 高 位 的 ， 谁 能 将 知 识 教 训 他 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Is anyone able to give teaching to God? for he is the judge of those who are on high.
<br>21:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 人 至 死 身 体 强 壮 ， 尽 得 平 靖 安 逸 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;One comes to his end in complete well-being, full of peace and quiet:
<br>21:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 的 奶 桶 充 满 ， 他 的 骨 髓 滋 润 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;His buckets are full of milk, and there is no loss of strength in his bones.
<br>21:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 人 至 死 心 中 痛 苦 ， 终 身 未 尝 福 乐 的 滋 味 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And another comes to his end with a bitter soul, without ever tasting good.
<br>21:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 一 样 躺 卧 在 尘 土 中 ， 都 被 虫 子 遮 盖 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Together they go down to the dust, and are covered by the worm.
<br>21:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 知 道 你 们 的 意 思 ， 并 诬 害 我 的 计 谋 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;See, I am conscious of your thoughts, and of your violent purposes against me;
<br>21:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 说 ， 霸 者 的 房 屋 在 哪 里 ？ 恶 人 住 过 的 帐 棚 在 哪 里 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For you say, Where is the house of the ruler, and where is the tent of the evil-doer?
<br>21:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 岂 没 有 询 问 过 路 的 人 吗 ？ 不 知 道 他 们 所 引 的 证 据 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Have you not put the question to the travellers, and do you not take note of their experience?
<br>21:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 是 恶 人 在 祸 患 的 日 子 得 存 留 ， 在 发 怒 的 日 子 得 逃 脱 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;How the evil man goes free in the day of trouble, and has salvation in the day of wrath?
<br>21:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 所 行 的 ， 有 谁 当 面 给 他 说 明 。 他 所 做 的 ， 有 谁 报 应 他 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Who will make his way clear to his face? and if he has done a thing, who gives him punishment for it?
<br>21:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;然 而 他 要 被 抬 到 茔 地 ， 并 有 人 看 守 坟 墓 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He is taken to his last resting-place, and keeps watch over it.
<br>21:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 要 以 谷 中 的 土 块 为 甘 甜 ， 在 他 以 先 去 的 无 数 ， 在 他 以 后 去 的 更 多 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The earth of the valley covering his bones is sweet to him, and all men come after him, as there were unnumbered before him.
<br>21:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 们 对 答 的 话 中 既 都 错 谬 ， 怎 么 徒 然 安 慰 我 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Why then do you give me comfort with words in which there is no profit, when you see that there is nothing in your answers but deceit?
