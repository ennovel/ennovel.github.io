<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Zophar the Naamathite made answer and said,
<br>20:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 心 中 急 躁 ， 所 以 我 的 思 念 叫 我 回 答 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For this cause my thoughts are troubling me and driving me on.
<br>20:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 已 听 见 那 羞 辱 我 ， 责 备 我 的 话 。 我 的 悟 性 叫 我 回 答 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;I have to give ear to arguments which put me to shame, and your answers to me are wind without wisdom.
<br>20:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 岂 不 知 亘 古 以 来 ， 自 从 人 生 在 地 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Have you knowledge of this from early times, when man was placed on the earth,
<br>20:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;恶 人 夸 胜 是 暂 时 的 ， 不 敬 虔 人 的 喜 乐 ， 不 过 转 眼 之 间 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;That the pride of the sinner is short, and the joy of the evil-doer but for a minute?
<br>20:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 的 尊 荣 虽 达 到 天 上 ， 头 虽 顶 到 云 中 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Though he is lifted up to the heavens, and his head goes up to the clouds;
<br>20:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 终 必 灭 亡 ， 像 自 己 的 粪 一 样 。 素 来 见 他 的 人 要 说 ， 他 在 哪 里 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Like the waste from his body he comes to an end for ever: those who have seen him say, Where is he?
<br>20:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 必 飞 去 如 梦 ， 不 再 寻 见 ， 速 被 赶 去 ， 如 夜 间 的 异 象 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He is gone like a dream, and is not seen again; he goes in flight like a vision of the night.
<br>20:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;亲 眼 见 过 他 的 ， 必 不 再 见 他 。 他 的 本 处 也 再 见 不 着 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The eye which saw him sees him no longer; and his place has no more knowledge of him.
<br>20:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 的 儿 女 要 求 穷 人 的 恩 。 他 的 手 要 赔 还 不 义 之 财 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;His children are hoping that the poor will be kind to them, and his hands give back his wealth.
<br>20:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 的 骨 头 虽 然 有 青 年 之 力 ， 却 要 和 他 一 同 躺 卧 在 尘 土 中 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;His bones are full of young strength, but it will go down with him into the dust.
<br>20:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 口 内 虽 以 恶 为 甘 甜 ， 藏 在 舌 头 底 下 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Though evil-doing is sweet in his mouth, and he keeps it secretly under his tongue;
<br>20:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;爱 恋 不 舍 ， 含 在 口 中 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Though he takes care of it, and does not let it go, but keeps it still in his mouth;
<br>20:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 的 食 物 在 肚 里 却 要 化 为 酸 ， 在 他 里 面 成 为 虺 蛇 的 恶 毒 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;His food becomes bitter in his stomach; the poison of snakes is inside him.
<br>20:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 吞 了 财 宝 ， 还 要 吐 出 。 神 要 从 他 腹 中 掏 出 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He takes down wealth as food, and sends it up again; it is forced out of his stomach by God.
<br>20:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 必 吸 饮 虺 蛇 的 毒 气 。 蝮 蛇 的 舌 头 也 必 杀 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He takes the poison of snakes into his mouth, the tongue of the snake is the cause of his death.
<br>20:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;流 奶 与 蜜 之 河 ， 他 不 得 再 见 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Let him not see the rivers of oil, the streams of honey and milk.
<br>20:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 劳 碌 得 来 的 要 赔 还 ， 不 得 享 用 （ 原 文 作 吞 下 ） ， 不 能 照 所 得 的 财 货 欢 乐 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He is forced to give back the fruit of his work, and may not take it for food; he has no joy in the profit of his trading.
<br>20:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 欺 压 穷 人 ， 且 又 离 弃 。 强 取 非 自 己 所 盖 的 房 屋 （ 或 作 强 取 房 屋 不 得 再 建 造 ） 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Because he has been cruel to the poor, turning away from them in their trouble; because he has taken a house by force which he did not put up;
<br>20:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 因 贪 而 无 厌 ， 所 喜 悦 的 连 一 样 也 不 能 保 守 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;There is no peace for him in his wealth, and no salvation for him in those things in which he took delight.
<br>20:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;其 余 的 没 有 一 样 他 不 吞 灭 ， 所 以 他 的 福 乐 不 能 长 久 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He had never enough for his desire; for this cause his well-being will quickly come to an end.
<br>20:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 在 满 足 有 余 的 时 候 ， 必 到 狭 窄 的 地 步 。 凡 受 苦 楚 的 人 ， 都 必 加 手 在 他 身 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Even when his wealth is great, he is full of care, for the hand of everyone who is in trouble is turned against him.
<br>20:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 正 要 充 满 肚 腹 的 时 候 ， 神 必 将 猛 烈 的 忿 怒 ， 降 在 他 身 上 。 正 在 他 吃 饭 的 时 候 ， 要 将 这 忿 怒 像 雨 降 在 他 身 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;God gives him his desire, and sends the heat of his wrath on him, making it come down on him like rain.
<br>20:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 要 躲 避 铁 器 。 铜 弓 的 箭 要 将 他 射 透 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He may go in flight from the iron spear, but the arrow from the bow of brass will go through him;
<br>20:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 把 箭 一 抽 ， 就 从 他 身 上 出 来 。 发 光 的 箭 头 从 他 胆 中 出 来 ， 有 惊 惶 临 在 他 身 上 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He is pulling it out, and it comes out of his back; and its shining point comes out of his side; he is overcome by fears.
<br>20:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 的 财 宝 归 于 黑 暗 。 人 所 不 吹 的 火 要 把 他 烧 灭 ， 要 把 他 帐 棚 中 所 剩 下 的 烧 毁 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;All his wealth is stored up for the dark: a fire not made by man sends destruction on him, and on everything in his tent.
<br>20:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;天 要 显 明 他 的 罪 孽 ， 地 要 兴 起 攻 击 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The heavens make clear his sin, and the earth gives witness against him.
<br>20:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 的 家 产 必 然 过 去 。 神 发 怒 的 日 子 ， 他 的 货 物 都 要 消 灭 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The produce of his house is taken away into another country, like things given into the hands of others in the day of wrath.
<br>20:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 是 恶 人 从 神 所 得 的 分 ， 是 神 为 他 所 定 的 产 业 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;This is the reward of the evil man, and the heritage given to him by God.
