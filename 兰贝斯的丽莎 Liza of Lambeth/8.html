When she woke, she rubbed her eyes to gather her senses together and gradually she remembered having gone to the theatre on the previous evening; then suddenly everything came back to her. She stretched out her legs and gave a long sigh of delight. Her heart was full; she thought of Jim, and the delicious sensation of love came over her. Closing her eyes, she imagined his warm kisses, and she lifted up her arms as if to put them round his neck and draw him down to her; she almost felt the rough beard on her face, and the strong heavy arms round her body. She smiled to herself and took a long breath; then, slipping back the sleeves of her nightdress, she looked at her own thin arms, just two pieces of bone with not a muscle on them, but very white and showing distinctly the interlacement of blue veins: she did not notice that her hands were rough, and red and dirty with the nails broken, and bitten to the quick. She got out of bed and looked at herself in the glass over the mantelpiece: with one hand she brushed back her hair and smiled at herself; her face was very small and thin, but the complexion was nice, clear and white, with a delicate tint of red on the cheeks, and her eyes were big and dark like her hair. She felt very happy.</p> 
<p>She did not want to dress yet, but rather to sit down and think, so she twisted up her hair into a little knot, slipped a skirt over her nightdress, and sat on a chair near the window and began looking around. The decorations of the room had been centred on the mantelpiece; the chief ornament consisted of a pear and an apple, a pineapple, a bunch of grapes, and several fat plums, all very beautifully done in wax, as was the fashion about the middle of this most glorious reign. They were appropriately coloured--the apple blushing red, the grapes an inky black, emerald green leaves were scattered here and there to lend finish, and the whole was mounted on an ebonised stand covered with black velvet, and protected from dust and dirt by a beautiful glass cover bordered with red plush. Liza's eyes rested on this with approbation, and the pineapple quite made her mouth water. At either end of the mantelpiece were pink jars with blue flowers on the front; round the top in Gothic letters of gold was inscribed: 'A Present from a Friend'--these were products of a later, but not less artistic age. The intervening spaces were taken up with little jars and cups and saucers--gold inside, with a view of a town outside, and surrounding them, 'A Present from Clacton-on-Sea,' or, alliteratively, 'A Memento of Margate.' Of these many were broken, but they had been mended with glue, and it is well known that pottery in the eyes of the connoisseur loses none of its value by a crack or two. Then there were portraits innumerable--little yellow cartes-de-visite in velvet frames, some of which were decorated with shells; they showed strange people with old-fashioned clothes, the women with bodices and sleeves fitting close to the figure, stern-featured females with hair carefully parted in the middle and plastered down on each side, firm chins and mouths, with small, pig-like eyes and wrinkled faces, and the men were uncomfortably clad in Sunday garments, very stiff and uneasy in their awkward postures, with large whiskers and shaved chins and upper lips and a general air of horny-handed toil. Then there were one or two daguerreotypes, little full-length figures framed in gold paper. There was one of Mrs. Kemp's father and one of her mother, and there were several photographs of betrothed or newly-married couples, the lady sitting down and the man standing behind her with his hand on the chair, or the man sitting and the woman with her hand on his shoulder. And from all sides of the room, standing on the mantelpiece, hanging above it, on the wall and over the bed, they stared full-face into the room, self-consciously fixed for ever in their stiff discomfort.</p> 
<p>The walls were covered with dingy, antiquated paper, and ornamented with coloured supplements from Christmas Numbers--there was a very patriotic picture of a soldier shaking the hand of a fallen comrade and waving his arm in defiance of a band of advancing Arabs; there was a 'Cherry Ripe,' almost black with age and dirt; there were two almanacks several years old, one with a coloured portrait of the Marquess of Lorne, very handsome and elegantly dressed, the object of Mrs. Kemp's adoration since her husband's demise; the other a Jubilee portrait of the Queen, somewhat losing in dignity by a moustache which Liza in an irreverent moment had smeared on with charcoal.</p> 
<p>The furniture consisted of a wash-hand stand and a little deal chest of drawers, which acted as sideboard to such pots and pans and crockery as could not find room in the grate; and besides the bed there was nothing but two kitchen chairs and a lamp. Liza looked at it all and felt perfectly satisfied; she put a pin into one corner of the noble Marquess to prevent him from falling, fiddled about with the ornaments a little, and then started washing herself. After putting on her clothes she ate some bread-and-butter, swallowed a dishful of cold tea, and went out into the street.</p> 
<p>She saw some boys playing cricket and went up to them.</p> 
<p>'Let me ply,' she said.</p> 
<p>'Arright, Liza,' cried half a dozen of them in delight; and the captain added: 'You go an' scout over by the lamp-post.'</p> 
<p>'Go an' scout my eye!' said Liza, indignantly. 'When I ply cricket I does the battin'.'</p> 
<p>'Na, you're not goin' ter bat all the time. 'Oo are you gettin' at?' replied the captain, who had taken advantage of his position to put himself in first, and was still at the wicket.</p> 
<p>'Well, then I shan't ply,' answered Liza.</p> 
<p>'Garn, Ernie, let 'er go in!' shouted two or three members of the team.</p> 
<p>'Well, I'm busted!' remarked the captain, as she took his bat. 'You won't sty in long, I lay,' he said, as he sent the old bowler fielding and took the ball himself. He was a young gentleman who did not suffer from excessive backwardness.</p> 
<p>'Aht!' shouted a dozen voices as the ball went past Liza's bat and landed in the pile of coats which formed the wicket. The captain came forward to resume his innings, but Liza held the bat away from him.</p> 
<p>'Garn!' she said; 'thet was only a trial.'</p> 
<p>'You never said trial,' answered the captain indignantly.</p> 
<p>'Yus, I did,' said Liza; 'I said it just as the ball was comin'--under my breath.'</p> 
<p>'Well, I am busted!' repeated the captain.</p> 
<p>Just then Liza saw Tom among the lookers-on, and as she felt very kindly disposed to the world in general that morning, she called out to him:</p> 
<p>''Ulloa, Tom!' she said. 'Come an' give us a ball; this chap can't bowl.'</p> 
<p>'Well, I got yer aht, any'ow,' said that person.</p> 
<p>'Ah, yer wouldn't 'ave got me aht plyin' square. But a trial ball--well, one don't ever know wot a trial ball's goin' ter do.'</p> 
<p>Tom began bowling very slowly and easily, so that Liza could swing her bat round and hit mightily; she ran well, too, and pantingly brought up her score to twenty. Then the fielders interposed.</p> 
<p>'I sy, look 'ere, 'e's only givin' 'er lobs; 'e's not tryin' ter git 'er aht.'</p> 
<p>'You're spoilin' our gime.'</p> 
<p>'I don't care; I've got twenty runs--thet's more than you could do. I'll go aht now of my own accord, so there! Come on, Tom.'</p> 
<p>Tom joined her, and as the captain at last resumed his bat and the game went on, they commenced talking, Liza leaning against the wall of a house, while Tom stood in front of her, smiling with pleasure.</p> 
<p>'Where 'ave you been idin' yerself, Tom? I ain't seen yer for I dunno 'ow long.'</p> 
<p>'I've been abaht as usual; an' I've seen you when you didn't see me.'</p> 
<p>'Well, yer might 'ave come up and said good mornin' when you see me.'</p> 
<p>'I didn't want ter force myself on, yer, Liza.'</p> 
<p>'Garn! You are a bloomin' cuckoo. I'm blowed!'</p> 
<p>'I thought yer didn't like me 'angin' round yer; so I kep' awy.'</p> 
<p>'Why, yer talks as if I didn't like yer. Yer don't think I'd 'ave come aht beanfeastin' with yer if I 'adn't liked yer?'</p> 
<p>Liza was really very dishonest, but she felt so happy this morning that she loved the whole world, and of course Tom came in with the others. She looked very kindly at him, and he was so affected that a great lump came in his throat and he could not speak.</p> 
<p>Liza's eyes turned to Jim's house, and she saw coming out of the door a girl of about her own age; she fancied she saw in her some likeness to Jim.</p> 
<p>'Say, Tom,' she asked, 'thet ain't Blakeston's daughter, is it?'</p> 
<p>'Yus thet's it.'</p> 
<p>'I'll go an' speak to 'er,' said Liza, leaving Tom and going over the road.</p> 
<p>'You're Polly Blakeston, ain't yer?' she said.</p> 
<p>'Thet's me!' said the girl.</p> 
<p>'I thought you was. Your dad, 'e says ter me, "You dunno my daughter, Polly, do yer?" says 'e. "Na," says I, "I don't." "Well," says 'e, "You can't miss 'er when you see 'er." An' right enough I didn't.'</p> 
<p>'Mother says I'm all father, an' there ain't nothin' of 'er in me. Dad says it's lucky it ain't the other wy abaht, or e'd 'ave got a divorce.'</p> 
<p>They both laughed.</p> 
<p>'Where are you goin' now?' asked Liza, looking at the slop-basin she was carrying.</p> 
<p>'I was just goin' dahn into the road ter get some ice-cream for dinner. Father 'ad a bit of luck last night, 'e says, and 'e'd stand the lot of us ice-cream for dinner ter-day.'</p> 
<p>'I'll come with yer if yer like.'</p> 
<p>'Come on!' And, already friends, they walked arm-in-arm to the Westminster Bridge Road. Then they went along till they came to a stall where an Italian was selling the required commodity, and having had a taste apiece to see if they liked it, Polly planked down sixpence and had her basin filled with a poisonous-looking mixture of red and white ice-cream.</p> 
<p>On the way back, looking up the street, Polly cried:</p> 
<p>'There's father!'</p> 
<p>Liza's heart beat rapidly and she turned red; but suddenly a sense of shame came over her, and casting down her head so that she might not see him, she said:</p> 
<p>'I think I'll be off 'ome an' see 'ow mother's gettin' on.' And before Polly could say anything she had slipped away and entered her own house.</p> 
<p>Mother was not getting on at all well.</p> 
<p>'You've come in at last, you ----, you!' snarled Mrs. Kemp, as Liza entered the room.</p> 
<p>'Wot's the matter, mother?'</p> 
<p>'Matter! I like thet--matter indeed! Go an' matter yerself an' be mattered! Nice way ter treat an old woman like me--an' yer own mother, too!'</p> 
<p>'Wot's up now?'</p> 
<p>'Don't talk ter me; I don't want ter listen ter you. Leavin' me all alone, me with my rheumatics, an' the neuralgy! I've 'ad the neuralgy all the mornin', and my 'ead's been simply splittin', so thet I thought the bones 'ud come apart and all my brains go streamin' on the floor. An' when I wake up there's no one ter git my tea for me, an' I lay there witin' an' witin', an' at last I 'ad ter git up and mike it myself. And, my 'ead simply cruel! Why, I might 'ave been burnt ter death with the fire alight an' me asleep.'</p> 
<p>'Well, I am sorry, mother; but I went aht just for a bit, an' didn't think you'd wike. An' besides, the fire wasn't alight.'</p> 
<p>'Garn with yer! I didn't treat my mother like thet. Oh, you've been a bad daughter ter me--an' I 'ad more illness carryin' you than with all the other children put togither. You was a cross at yer birth, an' you've been a cross ever since. An' now in my old age, when I've worked myself ter the bone, yer leaves me to starve and burn to death.' Here she began to cry, and the rest of her utterances was lost in sobs.</p> 
<p>* * * * *</p> 
<p>The dusk had darkened into night, and Mrs. Kemp had retired to rest with the dicky-birds. Liza was thinking of many things; she wondered why she had been unwilling to meet Jim in the morning.</p> 
<p>'I was a bally fool,' she said to herself.</p> 
<p>It really seemed an age since the previous night, and all that had happened seemed very long ago. She had not spoken to Jim all day, and she had so much to say to him. Then, wondering whether he was about, she went to the window and looked out; but there was nobody there. She closed the window again and sat just beside it; the time went on, and she wondered whether he would come, asking herself whether he had been thinking of her as she of him; gradually her thoughts grew vague, and a kind of mist came over them. She nodded. Suddenly she roused herself with a start, fancying she had heard something; she listened again, and in a moment the sound was repeated, three or four gentle taps on the window. She opened it quickly and whispered:</p> 
<p>'Jim.'</p> 
<p>'Thet's me,' he answered, 'come aht.'</p> 
<p>Closing the window, she went into the passage and opened the street door; it was hardly unlocked before Jim had pushed his way in; partly shutting it behind him, he took her in his arms and hugged her to his breast. She kissed him passionately.</p> 
<p>'I thought yer'd come ter-night, Jim; summat in my 'eart told me so. But you 'ave been long.'</p> 
<p>'I wouldn't come before, 'cause I thought there'd be people abaht. Kiss us!' And again he pressed his lips to hers, and Liza nearly fainted with the delight of it.</p> 
<p>'Let's go for a walk, shall we?' he said.</p> 
<p>'Arright!' They were speaking in whispers. 'You go into the road through the passage, an' I'll go by the street.'</p> 
<p>'Yus, thet's right,' and kissing her once more, he slid out, and she closed the door behind him.</p> 
<p>Then going back to get her hat, she came again into the passage, waiting behind the door till it might be safe for her to venture. She had not made up her mind to risk it, when she heard a key put in the lock, and she hardly had time to spring back to prevent herself from being hit by the opening door. It was a man, one of the upstairs lodgers.</p> 
<p>''Ulloa!' he said, ''oo's there?'</p> 
<p>'Mr. 'Odges! Strikes me, you did give me a turn; I was just goin' aht.' She blushed to her hair, but in the darkness he could see nothing.</p> 
<p>'Good night,' she said, and went out.</p> 
<p>She walked close along the sides of the houses like a thief, and the policeman as she passed him turned round and looked at her, wondering whether she was meditating some illegal deed. She breathed freely on coming into the open road, and seeing Jim skulking behind a tree, ran up to him, and in the shadows they kissed again.</p> 
<p>肯普太太惯常在星期天的早晨昏昏沉沉地睡大觉，否则也不会让丽莎这样尽睡着。</p> 
<p>丽莎醒来，揉揉眼睛，清一清头脑，渐渐记起了头夜到戏院看戏的事，接着一切全都闪现在眼前。</p> 
<p>她伸了伸腿，喜悦地深深叹息一声。她心潮如涌；她想着吉姆，沉浸在爱情的迷人的快感中。她闭着眼睛，想象他的火热的吻，她举起臂膀，仿佛要揽住他的脖子，使他俯下身子挨近她。她几乎感觉到他粗硬的胡子贴在她脸上，坚实的臂膊搂抱着她的身体。</p> 
<p>她自己笑笑，痛快地透了口气。于是她撩起睡衣的袖子，看看自己瘦削的手臂，就只两根骨头，没有一点肌肉，然而非常白嫩，一根根交叉的青色的血管看得清清楚楚。她没有注意到自己的手很粗，又红又脏，指甲有的坏了，有的被她咬到了指尖的活肉。</p> 
<p>她爬下床来，在壁炉架上的镜子里自己照照，一只手把头发往后掠了掠，对着自己微笑。她的面庞是小小的，而且很瘦，可是她的面色可好，白嫩清秀，两颊微微泛红，一双大眼睛同她的头发一样乌黑。她感到非常快活。</p> 
<p>她不想就换衣服，而要坐下随心想想，所以她把头发盘起一个小结子．在睡衣外面套上条裙子，在近窗口的一张椅子上坐下，朝室内四面看看。</p> 
<p>房间的壁炉架上主要的装饰品是一只生梨、一只苹果、一只菠萝、一串葡萄和几个肥硕的李子，全都是蜡制的，做得很好看I那是这个最昌盛的王朝注中期的时兴玩意。它们颜色逼真：苹果象涨红的脸，葡萄象墨水的蓝黑色，衬托着几瓣翠绿的叶子，整个这一堆水果搁在一个覆着黑丝绒的乌木座子上，上面罩着红色长毛绒镶边的漂亮的玻璃罩子，不让沾上灰尘。丽莎盯着这看，十分欣赏，菠萝使她看得淌口水。</p> 
<p>壁炉架的两旁是两只桃红色的大花瓶，几朵蓝色的花朵朝着外面I近瓶口处描着一圈金色的美术字：“一片情谊”。这两个花瓶倒有古董的艺术味儿。中间的位置上放着些杯盘和小花瓶——里面是金色的，外面是画的城市风景，边上一圈写着“克拉克顿注精制礼品”，有的还藏个韵，写着“马盖特注海滨纪念品”。这些东西，有的已经破损，但是用胶水粘补好的，不过大家知道，在鉴赏家眼里，陶器上有一、两道裂痕是丝毫无损其价值的。</p> 
<p>此外就是数不清的肖像——一张张明信片那么大的黄色的小照片，镶着丝绒框子，有的还用贝壳作装饰,照片上有穿着老式服装的怪样的男人们，有紧身围腰和袖子裹紧在身上的女人们。那些女人都面孔铁板，头发在正中央分开，贴牢在两边，下颔和嘴巴都显得很坚定，眼睛小得象猪眼睛，脸上皱纹密布。男人们穿着怪不舒服的节日穿的新衣裳，做着僵硬和尴尬的姿势，两鬓留着一大蓬络腮胡子，面颊和上嘴唇剃得光光的，他们给人以饱经风霜的印象。</p> 
<p>还有一、两张银版照相，是小小的全身像，金纸镶边。一张是肯普太太父亲的像，一张是肯普太太母亲的像。再就是几张订婚照和结婚照，女的坐着，男的站在她后面，手搁在椅背上，或者是男的坐着，女的手搭在他肩上。</p> 
<p>这些照相，有的竖在壁炉架上，有的挂在炉架顶上，有的挂在墙上，有的挂在床头；照相上的人们永远固定在他们僵硬而不舒服的状态，从各个角度面一直注视着这间房间。</p> 
<p>墙上糊着灰暗陈旧的墙纸，上面还点缀些圣诞特刊上剪下来的图画。有一张是很富有爱国精神的，一个士兵一面跟一个倒下的伙伴握手诀别，一面怒对一伙冲来的阿拉伯人挥着臂膊；一张是《樱桃园熟图》，日久尘染，几乎已经变成黑黑的了；还有两份几年前的旧年历，一份上面是洛恩侯爵注的彩色画像，极其漂亮而华贵，是肯普太太丈夫故后的爱之所钟；另一份上面是维多利亚女王在位六十周年庆典时的画像，可惜由于丽莎一时无礼，在女王脸上用木炭画了一簇小胡子，多少有损尊严。</p> 
<p>室内的家具有一只脸盆架，一张松板五斗橱，这是兼当餐具柜的，凡是壁炉前面放不下的瓶瓶罐罐都往这上面放。此外，除了那张床，就剩两只烧火椅子和一盏灯。</p> 
<p>丽莎瞧着这一切，十分满意。</p> 
<p>她在高贵的侯爵像的一个角上钉上一根别针，不让它掉下来，又随手把那些小摆设弄弄整齐，然后她自己开始梳头洗脸。</p> 
<p>她穿好衣服，吃了些黄油面包，一口吞了一碗冷茶，出门到街上去了。</p> 
<p>她看见几个男孩子在打板球，就走到他们跟前。</p> 
<p>“我来打，”她说。</p> 
<p>“好，丽莎，”六七个孩子开心地叫道。队长接着说，“你到灯杆那边去守外场。”</p> 
<p>“守你的魂！”丽莎气呼呼地说。“我打板球，总是当击球手的。”</p> 
<p>“不，你不能总是当击球手。你当了我当什么？”队长回答说。他已经利用自己的身份，把自己先排进去，一直在场内。</p> 
<p>“好，那我就不打，”丽莎说。</p> 
<p>“得了，欧尼，让她进场！”队里两、三个队员嚷道。</p> 
<p>“哼，该死！”队长说，把他的球棒给了丽莎。“我可以打赌，你场内待不长，”说着，他叫原来的投球手去守外场，他自己拿起了球。他是少年绅士，不肯过分退让的。</p> 
<p>“出场！”当球飞过丽莎的球棒，打进了当作球门的一堆衣服里时，六、七个声音同时叫喊。队长跑上前来，要重当击球手，但是丽莎不把球棒给他。</p> 
<p>“去！”她说；“这只是练球，不能算。”</p> 
<p>“你没说过练球，”他恼火地回答。</p> 
<p>“说过，我说过，”丽莎说；“我说的时候，正好球来r 说得轻了些。”</p> 
<p>“哼，该死！”队长又是这么说。</p> 
<p>就在那个时候，丽莎在旁边观看的人丛中看到了汤姆。那天早晨，她正对世界上的一切都感到亲切，所以就朝他叫喊起来一一</p> 
<p>“喂，汤姆！”她说。“你来投球；那个家伙不行。”</p> 
<p>“不，好歹我把你打出场了，”那个家伙说。</p> 
<p>“呀，要是正式比赛，你休想把我打出场。而这是一次练球——练球的球可谁也说不准。”</p> 
<p>汤姆开始非常缓慢而且平稳地投球，因此丽莎能挥舞球棒狠狠地击球；而且她连续得分，气喘吁吁地打到了二十分。这时候外场员们提出意见了——</p> 
<p>“喂，喂，他尽给她投下手球，根本不想把她打出场。”</p> 
<p>“你在破坏我们的比赛。”</p> 
<p>“我不管I反正我得了二十分——这就比你们谁都强。现在我自动出场，就这样！来，汤姆。”</p> 
<p>汤姆到她身边。队长重新拿起他的球棒。比赛继续进行。丽莎和汤姆开始聊起天来，丽莎靠在一幢房子的墙上，汤姆站在她面前欢乐地微笑着。</p> 
<p>“你这一阵子躲到哪儿去了，汤姆？我不知多久没看见你了。”</p> 
<p>“我还是象平时一样常在街上逛逛；你不看见我，我倒总看见你。”</p> 
<p>“你看见我，也该过来招呼一声。”</p> 
<p>“我不愿硬叫自己缠着你，丽莎。”</p> 
<p>“去你的：你真是个莫名其妙的怪人！”</p> 
<p>“我想你不喜欢我缠着你，所以我避开些。”</p> 
<p>“啊，你这样说，好象我不喜欢你似的。要是我不喜欢你，我会跟你一起出去野餐狂欢吗？”</p> 
<p>丽莎实在是极不老实，不过今天早晨她爱整个世界，当然汤姆也在其中。</p> 
<p>她非常亲切地瞧着他，他感动得只觉得有一大块什么塞住了他的喉咙，说不出话来。</p> 
<p>丽莎的目光转向吉姆住的房子，看见门口走出一个和她差不多年龄的姑娘；她觉得她长得有点象吉姆。</p> 
<p>“哎，汤姆，”她问，“那个是不是布莱克斯顿的女儿？”</p> 
<p>“是的，正是。”</p> 
<p>“我去跟她说几句话，”丽莎说着，就丢下汤姆，跑了过去。</p> 
<p>“你是波莉·布莱克斯顿，是不是？’’她说。</p> 
<p>“我是！”那姑娘说。</p> 
<p>“我一看就知道你是的。你爸爸，他对我说，“你不认识我女儿波莉吗？’他说。‘不，’我说，‘我不认识。，</p> 
<p>“‘哎，’他说，‘你一看见她，就看出来了。’真的，我一看就看出来了。”</p> 
<p>“我妈说我完全象爸爸，一点不象她。我爸说幸亏没有倒个头，否则他要离婚了。”</p> 
<p>她们俩都笑了。</p> 
<p>“你这会上哪儿去？”丽莎问，看她手里捧着那只倒茶脚的盘子。</p> 
<p>“我就到大街上去买点冰淇淋，吃饭时候吃。我爸昨夜交好运，他说的，所以今天吃饭时候请我们大家吃冰淇淋。”</p> 
<p>“我同你一起去，好不好？”</p> 
<p>“好，走！”</p> 
<p>她们一下就成了朋友，手挽手地向威斯敏斯特桥大道走去。她们一路走到一家意大利人开的卖这东西的铺子，她们先各人尝了尝味道之后，波莉拿出六个便士，让她的那个盘子给装厂满满的一盘红色和白色混在一起、看上去象是有毒的冰淇淋。</p> 
<p>在回家的路上，波莉朝前一看，叫道——</p> 
<p>“我爸来了！”</p> 
<p>丽莎的心怦怦地跳起来，激动得脸也红了。但是突然感到一阵羞耻，她沉倒了头，尽量不要看见他。她说——</p> 
<p>“我要回家去看看我妈怎么样。”波莉还没来得及答话，她已经一溜烟跑进了自己屋里。</p> 
<p>她妈正觉得不舒服。</p> 
<p>“你到底来啦，你这——，你！’’肯普太太看见丽莎进来，大吼大叫。</p> 
<p>“怎么样，妈？”</p> 
<p>“怎么样！我这样子——你说怎么样！随你怎么样，你要怎么样就怎么样！好哇，你这样对待我这样个老太婆一一还是你自己的母亲呢！”</p> 
<p>“出了什么事？’’</p> 
<p>“别跟我说话；我不要听你说。你把我一个人丢在家里，又是我的风湿，又是神经痛！我今天一个早晨一直神经痛，头简直要裂开来，我想头颅骨会一裂两爿，脑浆会流了一地。我醒来的时候，没有人给我弄杯茶，我躺在床上尽是等着、等着，到头来还得自己爬起来弄。而我的头简直痛得要我的命！还有，炉子里点着火，我睡着，活活烧死也不知道。”</p> 
<p>“对不起，妈，不过我只出去了一刻工夫，想不到你会醒的。</p> 
<p>而且炉子没生火。”</p> 
<p>“去你的！我从来没有这样对待我的妈。啊，你真是个没良心的女儿——我肚子里有你的时候最难过，所有其他孩子加起来也没有使我那么难过。你生下来的时候，我苦透，你生下来以后．我一直为你吃尽苦头，现在我老了，一生做得筋疲力尽了，你却丢下我不管，让我去饿死、烧死。”说到这里，她放声大哭，其余的话都淹没在抽噎之中。</p> 
<p>黄昏进入夜晚，肯普太太跟那些小鸟一样静下来休息了。</p> 
<p>丽莎头脑里想着许多事情，她想为什么今天早晨她不愿意和吉姆见面。</p> 
<p>“我是个十足的傻瓜，”她自忖。</p> 
<p>昨天的夜晚竞象是不知多么久远，昨夜发生的事情确似发生在不知多久之前。</p> 
<p>她整天没跟吉姆说过一句话，她有满腔的话要跟他说。</p> 
<p>她不知他会不会在街上，所以她来到窗前，往外望着，但是外面什么人也没有。她重又把窗关了，就在窗边坐下，盼着他来，心里揣度着，他是不是也象她想着他那样地在想她呢。她头脑渐渐模糊起来。她瞌睡了。</p> 
<p>她蓦地惊醒，好象听见什么声音。她再仔细听，一会儿这声音又来了，在窗上轻轻的、得得的三、四声。她连忙开窗，低声地叫道一</p> 
<p>“吉姆。”</p> 
<p>“是我，”他回答；“出来。’’</p> 
<p>她把窗关上，跑到走廊里，去开沿街的门。锁刚开，占姆已经推门而入。他把门半掩着，把她一把抱住，紧紧贴在怀里。他热烈地吻她。</p> 
<p>“我知道你今夜会来的，我心里有什么东西告诉我的。可你来得这么晚。”</p> 
<p>“我故意不早来，因为我想街上有人。吻我！”他再次把嘴唇贴在她嘴唇上，丽莎乐陶陶的几乎晕过去。</p> 
<p>“我们去散一会步，好不好？”他说。</p> 
<p>“好！”他们低声耳语。“你穿小弄上大道，我打这街上走。”</p> 
<p>“好，那样好．”他又吻了她一下，溜出门去，她把门关好。</p> 
<p>然后她为了去拿顶帽子，回到走廊里，先在门背后等了一会儿，不要让人发觉了她的冒险行动。正在犹豫要不要回进去拿帽子的时候，她听见门锁上钥匙声音，想连忙缩回身子，不让有人开进门来撞到她，可是已经来不及。开门的是个男人，他是住在楼上的邻居。</p> 
<p>“谁？”他说，“谁在这儿？”</p> 
<p>“霍吉斯先生！Ⅱ育，你着实吓我一跳；我正要出去。”她脸涨得通红，幸亏他在黑暗里根本看不见。</p> 
<p>“再见，”她说完，就出去了。</p> 
<p>她紧贴着一幢幢房子的墙脚，象个贼似地走去。警察看见她走过，回过头来瞧着她，怀疑她是不是在想干什么违法的事情。</p> 
<p>她一进入大道，呼吸舒畅了，看见吉姆在一棵树下躲着，直奔上前去，他们在荫影底下又是接吻。</p>
