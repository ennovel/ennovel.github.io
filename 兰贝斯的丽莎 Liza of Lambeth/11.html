<p>''E ain't wot I thought 'e wos,' she said. 'I don't mind sayin' thet; but 'e 'as a lot ter put up with; I expect I'm rather tryin' sometimes, an' 'e means well. P'raps 'e'll be kinder like when the biby's born.'</p> 
<p>'Cheer up, old gal,' answered Liza, who had seen something of the lives of many married couples; 'it won't seem so bad after yer gets used to it; it's a bit disappointin' at fust, but yer gits not ter mind it.'</p> 
<p>After a little Sally said she must go and see about her husband's tea. She said good-bye, and then rather awkwardly:</p> 
<p>'Say, Liza, tike care of yerself!'</p> 
<p>'Tike care of meself--why?' asked Liza, in surprise.</p> 
<p>'Yer know wot I mean.'</p> 
<p>'Na, I'm darned if I do.'</p> 
<p>'Thet there Mrs. Blakeston, she's lookin' aht for you.'</p> 
<p>'Mrs. Blakeston!' Liza was startled.</p> 
<p>'Yus; she says she's goin' ter give you somethin' if she can git 'old on yer. I should advise yer ter tike care.'</p> 
<p>'Me?' said Liza.</p> 
<p>Sally looked away, so as not to see the other's face.</p> 
<p>'She says as 'ow yer've been messin' abaht with 'er old man.'</p> 
<p>Liza didn't say anything, and Sally, repeating her good-bye, slid off.</p> 
<p>Liza felt a chill run through her. She had several times noticed a scowl and a look of anger on Mrs. Blakeston's face, and she had avoided her as much as possible; but she had no idea that the woman meant to do anything to her. She was very frightened, a cold sweat broke out over her face. If Mrs. Blakeston got hold of her she would be helpless, she was so small and weak, while the other was strong and muscular. Liza wondered what she would do if she did catch her.</p> 
<p>That night she told Jim, and tried to make a joke of it.</p> 
<p>'I say, Jim, your missus--she says she's goin' ter give me socks if she catches me.'</p> 
<p>'My missus! 'Ow d'yer know?'</p> 
<p>'She's been tellin' people in the street.'</p> 
<p>'Go' lumme,' said Jim, furious, 'if she dares ter touch a 'air of your 'ead, swop me dicky I'll give 'er sich a 'idin' as she never 'ad before! By God, give me the chanst, an' I would let 'er 'ave it; I'm bloomin' well sick of 'er sulks!' He clenched his fist as he spoke.</p> 
<p>Liza was a coward. She could not help thinking of her enemy's threat; it got on her nerves, and she hardly dared go out for fear of meeting her; she would look nervously in front of her, quickly turning round if she saw in the distance anyone resembling Mrs. Blakeston. She dreamed of her at night; she saw the big, powerful form, the heavy, frowning face, and the curiously braided brown hair; and she would wake up with a cry and find herself bathed in sweat.</p> 
<p>It was the Saturday afternoon following this, a chill November day, with the roads sloshy, and a grey, comfortless sky that made one's spirits sink. It was about three o'clock, and Liza was coming home from work; she got into Vere Street, and was walking quickly towards her house when she saw Mrs. Blakeston coming towards her. Her heart gave a great jump. Turning, she walked rapidly in the direction she had come; with a screw round of her eyes she saw that she was being followed, and therefore went straight out of Vere Street. She went right round, meaning to get into the street from the other end and, unobserved, slip into her house, which was then quite close; but she dared not risk it immediately for fear Mrs. Blakeston should still be there; so she waited about for half an hour. It seemed an age. Finally, taking her courage in both hands, she turned the corner and entered Vere Street. She nearly ran into the arms of Mrs. Blakeston, who was standing close to the public-house door.</p> 
<p>Liza gave a little cry, and the woman said, with a sneer:</p> 
<p>'Yer didn't expect ter see me, did yer?'</p> 
<p>Liza did not answer, but tried to walk past her. Mrs. Blakeston stepped forward and blocked her way.</p> 
<p>'Yer seem ter be in a mighty fine 'urry,' she said.</p> 
<p>'Yus, I've got ter git 'ome,' said Liza, again trying to pass.</p> 
<p>'But supposin' I don't let yer?' remarked Mrs. Blakeston, preventing her from moving.</p> 
<p>'Why don't yer leave me alone?' Liza said. 'I ain't interferin' with you!'</p> 
<p>'Not interferin' with me, aren't yer? I like thet!'</p> 
<p>'Let me go by,' said Liza. 'I don't want ter talk ter you.'</p> 
<p>'Na, I know thet,' said the other; 'but I want ter talk ter you, an' I shan't let yer go until I've said wot I wants ter sy.'</p> 
<p>Liza looked round for help. At the beginning of the altercation the loafers about the public-house had looked up with interest, and gradually gathered round in a little circle. Passers-by had joined in, and a number of other people in the street, seeing the crowd, added themselves to it to see what was going on. Liza saw that all eyes were fixed on her, the men amused and excited, the women unsympathetic, rather virtuously indignant. Liza wanted to ask for help, but there were so many people, and they all seemed so much against her, that she had not the courage to. So, having surveyed the crowd, she turned her eyes to Mrs. Blakeston, and stood in front of her, trembling a little, and very white.</p> 
<p>'Na, 'e ain't there,' said Mrs. Blakeston, sneeringly, 'so yer needn't look for 'im.'</p> 
<p>'I dunno wot yer mean,' answered Liza, 'an' I want ter go awy. I ain't done nothin' ter you.'</p> 
<p>'Not done nothin' ter me?' furiously repeated the woman. 'I'll tell yer wot yer've done ter me--you've robbed me of my 'usbind, you 'ave. I never 'ad a word with my 'usbind until you took 'im from me. An' now it's all you with 'im. 'E's got no time for 'is wife an' family--it's all you. An' 'is money, too. I never git a penny of it; if it weren't for the little bit I 'ad saved up in the siving-bank, me an' my children 'ud be starvin' now! An' all through you!' She shook her fist at her.</p> 
<p>'I never 'ad any money from anyone.'</p> 
<p>'Don' talk ter me; I know yer did. Yer dirty bitch! You oughter be ishimed of yourself tikin' a married man from 'is family, an' 'im old enough ter be yer father.'</p> 
<p>'She's right there!' said one or two of the onlooking women. 'There can't be no good in 'er if she tikes somebody else's 'usbind.'</p> 
<p>'I'll give it yer!' proceeded Mrs. Blakeston, getting more hot and excited, brandishing her fist, and speaking in a loud voice, hoarse with rage. 'Oh, I've been tryin' ter git 'old on yer this four weeks. Why, you're a prostitute--that's wot you are!'</p> 
<p>'I'm not!' answered Liza indignantly.</p> 
<p>'Yus, you are,' repeated Mrs. Blakeston, advancing menacingly, so that Liza shrank back. 'An' wot's more, 'e treats yer like one. I know 'oo give yer thet black eye; thet shows what 'e thinks of yer! An' serve yer bloomin' well right if 'e'd give yer one in both eyes!'</p> 
<p>Mrs. Blakeston stood close in front of her, her heavy jaw protruded and the frown of her eyebrows dark and stern. For a moment she stood silent, contemplating Liza, while the surrounders looked on in breathless interest.</p> 
<p>'Yer dirty little bitch, you!' she said at last. 'Tike that!' and with her open hand she gave her a sharp smack on the cheek.</p> 
<p>Liza started back with a cry and put her hand up to her face.</p> 
<p>'An' tike thet!' added Mrs. Blakeston, repeating the blow. Then, gathering up the spittle in her mouth, she spat in Liza's face.</p> 
<p>Liza sprang on her, and with her hands spread out like claws buried her nails in the woman's face and drew them down her cheeks. Mrs. Blakeston caught hold of her hair with both hands and tugged at it as hard as she could. But they were immediately separated.</p> 
<p>''Ere, 'old 'ard!' said some of the men. 'Fight it aht fair and square. Don't go scratchin' and maulin' like thet.'</p> 
<p>'I'll fight 'er, I don't mind!' shouted Mrs. Blakeston, tucking up her sleeves and savagely glaring at her opponent.</p> 
<p>Liza stood in front of her, pale and trembling; as she looked at her enemy, and saw the long red marks of her nails, with blood coming from one or two of them, she shrank back.</p> 
<p>'I don't want ter fight,' she said hoarsely.</p> 
<p>'Na, I don't suppose yer do,' hissed the other, 'but yer'll damn well 'ave ter!'</p> 
<p>'She's ever so much bigger than me; I've got no chanst,' added Liza tearfully.</p> 
<p>'You should 'ave thought of thet before. Come on!' and with these words Mrs. Blakeston rushed upon her. She hit her with both fists one after the other. Liza did not try to guard herself, but imitating the woman's motion, hit out with her own fists; and for a minute or two they continued thus, raining blows on one another with the same windmill motion of the arms. But Liza could not stand against the other woman's weight; the blows came down heavy and rapid all over her face and head. She put up her hands to cover her face and turned her head away, while Mrs. Blakeston kept on hitting mercilessly.</p> 
<p>'Time!' shouted some of the men--'Time!' and Mrs. Blakeston stopped to rest herself.</p> 
<p>'It don't seem 'ardly fair to set them two on tergether. Liza's got no chanst against a big woman like thet,' said a man among the crowd.</p> 
<p>'Well, it's er' own fault,' answered a woman; 'she didn't oughter mess about with 'er 'usbind.'</p> 
<p>'Well, I don't think it's right,' added another man. 'She's gettin' it too much.'</p> 
<p>'An' serve 'er right too!' said one of the women. 'She deserves all she gets an' a damn sight more inter the bargain.'</p> 
<p>'Quite right,' put in a third; 'a woman's got no right ter tike someone's 'usbind from 'er. An' if she does she's bloomin' lucky if she gits off with a 'idin'--thet's wot I think.'</p> 
<p>'So do I. But I wouldn't 'ave thought it of Liza. I never thought she was a wrong 'un.'</p> 
<p>'Pretty specimen she is!' said a little dark woman, who looked like a Jewess. 'If she messed abaht with my old man, I'd stick 'er--I swear I would!'</p> 
<p>'Now she's been carryin' on with one, she'll try an' git others--you see if she don't.'</p> 
<p>'She'd better not come round my 'ouse; I'll soon give 'er wot for.'</p> 
<p>Meanwhile Liza was standing at one corner of the ring, trembling all over and crying bitterly. One of her eyes was bunged up, and her hair, all dishevelled, was hanging down over her face. Two young fellows, who had constituted themselves her seconds, were standing in front of her, offering rather ironical comfort. One of them had taken the bottom corners of her apron and was fanning her with it, while the other was showing her how to stand and hold her arms.</p> 
<p>'You stand up to 'er, Liza,' he was saying; 'there ain't no good funkin' it, you'll simply get it all the worse. You 'it 'er back. Give 'er one on the boko, like this--see; yer must show a bit of pluck, yer know.'</p> 
<p>Liza tried to check her sobs.</p> 
<p>'Yus, 'it 'er 'ard, that's wot yer've got ter do,' said the other. 'An' if yer find she's gettin' the better on yer, you close on 'er and catch 'old of 'er 'air and scratch 'er.'</p> 
<p>'You've marked 'er with yer nails, Liza. By gosh, you did fly on her when she spat at yer! thet's the way ter do the job!'</p> 
<p>Then turning to his fellow, he said:</p> 
<p>'D'yer remember thet fight as old Mother Cregg 'ad with another woman in the street last year?'</p> 
<p>'Na,' he answered, 'I never saw thet.'</p> 
<p>'It was a cawker; an' the cops come in and took 'em both off ter quod.'</p> 
<p>Liza wished the policemen would come and take her off; she would willingly have gone to prison to escape the fiend in front of her; but no help came.</p> 
<p>'Time's up!' shouted the referee. 'Fire away!'</p> 
<p>'Tike care of the cops!' shouted a man.</p> 
<p>'There's no fear abaht them,' answered somebody else. 'They always keeps out of the way when there's anythin' goin' on.'</p> 
<p>'Fire away!'</p> 
<p>Mrs. Blakeston attacked Liza madly; but the girl stood up bravely, and as well as she could gave back the blows she received. The spectators grew tremendously excited.</p> 
<p>'Got 'im again!' they shouted. 'Give it 'er, Liza, thet's a good 'un!--'it 'er 'ard!'</p> 
<p>'Two ter one on the old 'un!' shouted a sporting gentleman; but Liza found no backers.</p> 
<p>'Ain't she standin' up well now she's roused?' cried someone.</p> 
<p>'Oh, she's got some pluck in 'er, she 'as!'</p> 
<p>'Thet's a knock-aht!' they shouted as Mrs. Blakeston brought her fist down on to Liza's nose; the girl staggered back, and blood began to flow. Then, losing all fear, mad with rage, she made a rush on her enemy, and rained down blows all over her nose and eyes and mouth. The woman recoiled at the sudden violence of the onslaught, and the men cried:</p> 
<p>'By God, the little 'un's gettin' the best of it!'</p> 
<p>But quickly recovering herself the woman closed with Liza, and dug her nails into her flesh. Liza caught hold of her hair and pulled with all her might, and turning her teeth on Mrs. Blakeston tried to bite her. And thus for a minute they swayed about, scratching, tearing, biting, sweat and blood pouring down their faces, and their eyes fixed on one another, bloodshot and full of rage. The audience shouted and cheered and clapped their hands.</p> 
<p>'Wot the 'ell's up 'ere?'</p> 
<p>'I sy, look there,' said some of the women in a whisper. 'It's the 'usbind!'</p> 
<p>He stood on tiptoe and looked over the crowd.</p> 
<p>'My Gawd,' he said, 'it's Liza!'</p> 
<p>Then roughly pushing the people aside, he made his way through the crowd into the centre, and thrusting himself between the two women, tore them apart. He turned furiously on his wife.</p> 
<p>'By Gawd, I'll give yer somethin' for this!'</p> 
<p>And for a moment they all three stood silently looking at one another.</p> 
<p>Another man had been attracted by the crowd, and he, too, pushed his way through.</p> 
<p>'Come 'ome, Liza,' he said.</p> 
<p>'Tom!'</p> 
<p>He took hold of her arm, and led her through the people, who gave way to let her pass. They walked silently through the street, Tom very grave, Liza weeping bitterly.</p> 
<p>'Oh, Tom,' she sobbed after a while, 'I couldn't 'elp it!' Then, when her tears permitted, 'I did love 'im so!'</p> 
<p>When they got to the door she plaintively said: 'Come in,' and he followed her to her room. Here she sank on to a chair, and gave herself up to her tears.</p> 
<p>Tom wetted the end of a towel and began wiping her face, grimy with blood and tears. She let him do it, just moaning amid her sobs:</p> 
<p>'You are good ter me, Tom.'</p> 
<p>'Cheer up, old gal,' he said kindly, 'it's all over now.'</p> 
<p>After a while the excess of crying brought its cessation. She drank some water, and then taking up a broken handglass she looked at herself, saying:</p> 
<p>'I am a sight!' and proceeded to wind up her hair. 'You 'ave been good ter me, Tom,' she repeated, her voice still broken with sobs; and as he sat down beside her she took his hand.</p> 
<p>'Na, I ain't,' he answered; 'it's only wot anybody 'ud 'ave done.'</p> 
<p>'Yer know, Tom,' she said, after a little silence, 'I'm so sorry I spoke cross like when I met yer in the street; you ain't spoke ter me since.'</p> 
<p>'Oh, thet's all over now, old lidy, we needn't think of thet.'</p> 
<p>'Oh, but I 'ave treated yer bad. I'm a regular wrong 'un, I am.'</p> 
<p>He pressed her hand without speaking.</p> 
<p>'I say, Tom,' she began, after another pause. 'Did yer know thet--well, you know--before ter-day?'</p> 
<p>He blushed as he answered:</p> 
<p>'Yus.'</p> 
<p>She spoke very sadly and slowly.</p> 
<p>'I thought yer did; yer seemed so cut up like when I used to meet yer. Yer did love me then, Tom, didn't yer?'</p> 
<p>'I do now, dearie,' he answered.</p> 
<p>'Ah, it's too lite now,' she sighed.</p> 
<p>'D'yer know, Liza,' he said, 'I just abaht kicked the life aht of a feller 'cause 'e said you was messin' abaht with--with 'im.'</p> 
<p>'An' yer knew I was?'</p> 
<p>'Yus--but I wasn't goin' ter 'ave anyone say it before me.'</p> 
<p>'They've all rounded on me except you, Tom. I'd 'ave done better if I'd tiken you when you arst me; I shouldn't be where I am now, if I 'ad.'</p> 
<p>'Well, won't yer now? Won't yer 'ave me now?'</p> 
<p>'Me? After wot's 'appened?'</p> 
<p>'Oh, I don't mind abaht thet. Thet don't matter ter me if you'll marry me. I fair can't live without yer, Liza--won't yer?'</p> 
<p>She groaned.</p> 
<p>'Na, I can't, Tom, it wouldn't be right.'</p> 
<p>'Why, not, if I don't mind?'</p> 
<p>'Tom,' she said, looking down, almost whispering, 'I'm like that--you know!'</p> 
<p>'Wot d'yer mean?'</p> 
<p>She could scarcely utter the words--</p> 
<p>'I think I'm in the family wy.'</p> 
<p>He paused a moment; then spoke again.</p> 
<p>'Well--I don't mind, if yer'll only marry me.'</p> 
<p>'Na, I can't, Tom,' she said, bursting into tears; 'I can't, but you are so good ter me; I'd do anythin' ter mike it up ter you.'</p> 
<p>She put her arms round his neck and slid on to his knees.</p> 
<p>'Yer know, Tom, I couldn't marry yer now; but anythin' else--if yer wants me ter do anythin' else, I'll do it if it'll mike you 'appy.'</p> 
<p>He did not understand, but only said:</p> 
<p>'You're a good gal, Liza,' and bending down he kissed her gravely on the forehead.</p> 
<p>Then with a sigh he lifted her down, and getting up left her alone. For a while she sat where he left her, but as she thought of all she had gone through her loneliness and misery overcame her, the tears welled forth, and throwing herself on the bed she buried her face in the pillows.</p> 
<p>* * * * *</p> 
<p>Jim stood looking at Liza as she went off with Tom, and his wife watched him jealously.</p> 
<p>'It's 'er you're thinkin' abaht. Of course you'd 'ave liked ter tike 'er 'ome yerself, I know, an' leave me to shift for myself.'</p> 
<p>'Shut up!' said Jim, angrily turning upon her.</p> 
<p>'I shan't shut up,' she answered, raising her voice. 'Nice 'usbind you are. Go' lumme, as good as they mike 'em! Nice thing ter go an' leave yer wife and children for a thing like thet! At your age, too! You oughter be ashimed of yerself. Why, it's like messin' abaht with your own daughter!'</p> 
<p>'By God!'--he ground his teeth with rage--'if yer don't leave me alone, I'll kick the life aht of yer!'</p> 
<p>'There!' she said, turning to the crowd--'there, see 'ow 'e treats me! Listen ter that! I've been 'is wife for twenty years, an' yer couldn't 'ave 'ad a better wife, an' I've bore 'im nine children, yet say nothin' of a miscarriage, an' I've got another comin', an' thet's 'ow 'e treats me! Nice 'usbind, ain't it?' She looked at him scornfully, then again at the surrounders as if for their opinion.</p> 
<p>'Well, I ain't goin' ter stay 'ere all night; get aht of the light!' He pushed aside the people who barred his way, and the one or two who growled a little at his roughness, looking at his angry face, were afraid to complain.</p> 
<p>'Look at 'im!' said his wife. ''E's afraid, 'e is. See 'im slinkin' awy like a bloomin' mongrel with 'is tail between 'is legs. Ugh!' She walked just behind him, shouting and brandishing her arms.</p> 
<p>'Yer dirty beast, you,' she yelled, 'ter go foolin' abaht with a little girl! Ugh! I wish yer wasn't my 'usbind; I wouldn't be seen drowned with yer, if I could 'elp it. Yer mike me sick ter look at yer.'</p> 
<p>The crowd followed them on both sides of the road, keeping at a discreet distance, but still eagerly listening.</p> 
<p>Jim turned on her once or twice and said:</p> 
<p>'Shut up!'</p> 
<p>But it only made her more angry. 'I tell yer I shan't shut up. I don't care 'oo knows it, you're a ----, you are! I'm ashimed the children should 'ave such a father as you. D'yer think I didn't know wot you was up ter them nights you was awy--courtin', yus, courtin'? You're a nice man, you are!'</p> 
<p>Jim did not answer her, but walked on. At last he turned round to the people who were following and said:</p> 
<p>'Na then, wot d'you want 'ere? You jolly well clear, or I'll give some of you somethin'!'</p> 
<p>They were mostly boys and women, and at his words they shrank back.</p> 
<p>''E's afraid ter sy anythin' ter me,' jeered Mrs. Blakeston. ''E's a beauty!'</p> 
<p>Jim entered his house, and she followed him till they came up into their room. Polly was giving the children their tea. They all started up as they saw their mother with her hair and clothes in disorder, blotches of dried blood on her face, and the long scratch-marks.</p> 
<p>'Oh, mother,' said Polly, 'wot is the matter?'</p> 
<p>''E's the matter.' she answered, pointing to her husband. 'It's through 'im I've got all this. Look at yer father, children; e's a father to be proud of, leavin' yer ter starve an' spendin' 'is week's money on a dirty little strumper.'</p> 
<p>Jim felt easier now he had not got so many strange eyes on him.</p> 
<p>'Now, look 'ere,' he said, 'I'm not goin' ter stand this much longer, so just you tike care.'</p> 
<p>'I ain't frightened of yer. I know yer'd like ter kill me, but yer'll get strung up if you do.'</p> 
<p>'Na, I won't kill yer, but if I 'ave any more of your sauce I'll do the next thing to it.'</p> 
<p>'Touch me if yer dare,' she said, 'I'll 'ave the law on you. An' I shouldn't mind 'ow many month's 'ard you got.'</p> 
<p>'Be quiet!' he said, and, closing his hand, gave her a heavy blow in the chest that made her stagger.</p> 
<p>'Oh, you ----!' she screamed.</p> 
<p>She seized the poker, and in a fury of rage rushed at him.</p> 
<p>'Would yer?' he said, catching hold of it and wrenching it from her grasp. He threw it to the end of the room and grappled with her. For a moment they swayed about from side to side, then with an effort he lifted her off her feet and threw her to the ground; but she caught hold of him and he came down on the top of her. She screamed as her head thumped down on the floor, and the children, who were standing huddled up in a corner, terrified, screamed too.</p> 
<p>Jim caught hold of his wife's head and began beating it against the floor.</p> 
<p>She cried out: 'You're killing me! Help! help!'</p> 
<p>Polly in terror ran up to her father and tried to pull him off.</p> 
<p>'Father, don't 'it 'er! Anythin' but thet--for God's sike!'</p> 
<p>'Leave me alone,' he said, 'or I'll give you somethin' too.'</p> 
<p>She caught hold of his arm, but Jim, still kneeling on his wife, gave Polly a backhanded blow which sent her staggering back.</p> 
<p>'Tike that!'</p> 
<p>Polly ran out of the room, downstairs to the first-floor front, where two men and two women were sitting at tea.</p> 
<p>'Oh, come an' stop father!' she cried. ''E's killin' mother!'</p> 
<p>'Why, wot's 'e doin'?'</p> 
<p>'Oh, 'e's got 'er on the floor, an' 'e's bangin' 'er 'ead. 'E's payin' 'er aht for givin' Liza Kemp a 'idin'.'</p> 
<p>One of the women started up and said to her husband:</p> 
<p>'Come on, John, you go an' stop it.'</p> 
<p>'Don't you, John,' said the other man. 'When a man's givin' 'is wife socks it's best not ter interfere.'</p> 
<p>'But 'e's killin' 'er,' repeated Polly, trembling with fright.</p> 
<p>'Garn!' rejoined the man, 'she'll git over it; an' p'raps she deserves it, for all you know.'</p> 
<p>John sat undecided, looking now at Polly, now at his wife, and now at the other man.</p> 
<p>'Oh, do be quick--for God's sike!' said Polly.</p> 
<p>At that moment a sound as of something smashing was heard upstairs, and a woman's shriek. Mrs. Blakeston, in an effort to tear herself away from her husband, had knocked up against the wash-hand stand, and the whole thing had crashed down.</p> 
<p>'Go on, John,' said the wife.</p> 
<p>'No, I ain't goin'; I shan't do no good, an' 'e'll only round on me.'</p> 
<p>'Well, you are a bloomin' lot of cowards, thet's all I can say,' indignantly answered the wife. 'But I ain't goin' ter see a woman murdered; I'll go an' stop 'im.'</p> 
<p>With that she ran upstairs and threw open the door. Jim was still kneeling on his wife, hitting her furiously, while she was trying to protect her head and face with her hands.</p> 
<p>'Leave off!' shouted the woman.</p> 
<p>Jim looked up. ''Oo the devil are you?' he said.</p> 
<p>'Leave off, I tell yer. Aren't yer ashimed of yerself, knockin' a woman abaht like that?' And she sprang at him, seizing his fist.</p> 
<p>'Let go,' he said, 'or I'll give you a bit.'</p> 
<p>'Yer'd better not touch me,' she said. 'Yer dirty coward! Why, look at 'er, she's almost senseless.'</p> 
<p>Jim stopped and gazed at his wife. He got up and gave her a kick.</p> 
<p>'Git up!' he said; but she remained huddled up on the floor, moaning feebly. The woman from downstairs went on her knees and took her head in her arms.</p> 
<p>'Never mind, Mrs. Blakeston. 'E's not goin' ter touch yer. 'Ere, drink this little drop of water.' Then turning to Jim, with infinite disdain: 'Yer dirty blackguard, you! If I was a man I'd give you something for this.'</p> 
<p>Jim put on his hat and went out, slamming the door, while the woman shouted after him: 'Good riddance!'</p> 
<p>* * * * *</p> 
<p>'Lord love yer,' said Mrs. Kemp, 'wot is the matter?'</p> 
<p>She had just come in, and opening the door had started back in surprise at seeing Liza on the bed, all tears. Liza made no answer, but cried as if her heart were breaking. Mrs. Kemp went up to her and tried to look at her face.</p> 
<p>'Don't cry, dearie; tell us wot it is.'</p> 
<p>Liza sat up and dried her eyes.</p> 
<p>'I am so un'appy!'</p> 
<p>'Wot 'ave yer been doin' ter yer fice? My!'</p> 
<p>'Nothin'.'</p> 
<p>'Garn! Yer can't 'ave got a fice like thet all by itself.'</p> 
<p>'I 'ad a bit of a scrimmage with a woman dahn the street,' sobbed out Liza.</p> 
<p>'She 'as give yer a doin'; an' yer all upset--an' look at yer eye! I brought in a little bit of stike for ter-morrer's dinner; you just cut a bit off an' put it over yer optic, that'll soon put it right. I always used ter do thet myself when me an' your poor father 'ad words.'</p> 
<p>'Oh, I'm all over in a tremble, an' my 'ead, oo, my 'ead does feel bad!'</p> 
<p>'I know wot yer want,' remarked Mrs. Kemp, nodding her head, 'an' it so 'appens as I've got the very thing with me.' She pulled a medicine bottle out of her pocket, and taking out the cork smelt it. 'Thet's good stuff, none of your firewater or your methylated spirit. I don't often indulge in sich things, but when I do I likes to 'ave the best.'</p> 
<p>She handed the bottle to Liza, who took a mouthful and gave it her back; she had a drink herself, and smacked her lips.</p> 
<p>Thet's good stuff. 'Ave a drop more.'</p> 
<p>'Na,' said Liza, 'I ain't used ter drinkin' spirits.'</p> 
<p>She felt dull and miserable, and a heavy pain throbbed through her head. If she could only forget!</p> 
<p>'Na, I know you're not, but, bless your soul, thet won' 'urt yer. It'll do you no end of good. Why, often when I've been feelin' thet done up thet I didn't know wot ter do with myself, I've just 'ad a little drop of whisky or gin--I'm not partic'ler wot spirit it is--an' it's pulled me up wonderful.'</p> 
<p>Liza took another sip, a slightly longer one; it burnt as it went down her throat, and sent through her a feeling of comfortable warmth.</p> 
<p>'I really do think it's doin' me good,' she said, wiping her eyes and giving a sigh of relief as the crying ceased.</p> 
<p>'I knew it would. Tike my word for it, if people took a little drop of spirits in time, there'd be much less sickness abaht.'</p> 
<p>They sat for a while in silence, then Mrs. Kemp remarked:</p> 
<p>'Yer know, Liza, it strikes me as 'ow we could do with a drop more. You not bein' in the 'abit of tikin' anythin' I only brought just this little drop for me; an' it ain't took us long ter finish thet up. But as you're an invalid like we'll git a little more this time; it's sure ter turn aht useful.'</p> 
<p>'But you ain't got nothin' ter put it in.'</p> 
<p>'Yus, I 'ave,' answered Mrs. Kemp; 'there's thet bottle as they gives me at the 'orspital. Just empty the medicine aht into the pile, an' wash it aht, an' I'll tike it round to the pub myself.'</p> 
<p>Liza, when she was left alone, began to turn things over in her mind. She did not feel so utterly unhappy as before, for the things she had gone through seemed further away.</p> 
<p>'After all,' she said, 'it don't so much matter.'</p> 
<p>Mrs. Kemp came in.</p> 
<p>''Ave a little drop more, Liza.' she said.</p> 
<p>'Well, I don't mind if I do. I'll get some tumblers, shall I? There's no mistike abaht it,' she added, when she had taken a little, 'it do buck yer up.'</p> 
<p>'You're right, Liza--you're right. An' you wanted it badly. Fancy you 'avin' a fight with a woman! Oh, I've 'ad some in my day, but then I wasn't a little bit of a thing like you is. I wish I'd been there, I wouldn't 'ave stood by an' looked on while my daughter was gettin' the worst of it; although I'm turned sixty-five, an' gettin' on for sixty-six, I'd 'ave said to 'er: "If you touch my daughter you'll 'ave me ter deal with, so just look aht!"'</p> 
<p>She brandished her glass, and that reminding her, she refilled it and Liza's.</p> 
<p>'Ah, Liza,' she remarked, 'you're a chip of the old block. Ter see you settin' there an' 'avin' your little drop, it mikes me feel as if I was livin' a better life. Yer used ter be rather 'ard on me, Liza, 'cause I took a little drop on Saturday nights. An', mind, I don't sy I didn't tike a little drop too much sometimes--accidents will occur even in the best regulated of families, but wot I say is this--it's good stuff, I say, an' it don't 'urt yer.'</p> 
<p>'Buck up, old gal!' said Liza, filling the glasses, 'no 'eel-taps. I feel like a new woman now. I was thet dahn in the dumps--well, I shouldn't 'ave cared if I'd been at the bottom of the river, an' thet's the truth.'</p> 
<p>'You don't sy so,' replied her affectionate mother.</p> 
<p>'Yus, I do, an' I mean it too, but I don't feel like thet now. You're right, mother, when you're in trouble there's nothin' like a bit of spirits.'</p> 
<p>'Well, if I don't know, I dunno 'oo does, for the trouble I've 'ad, it 'ud be enough to kill many women. Well, I've 'ad thirteen children, an' you can think wot thet was; everyone I 'ad I used ter sy I wouldn't 'ave no more--but one does, yer know. You'll 'ave a family some day, Liza, an' I shouldn't wonder if you didn't 'ave as many as me. We come from a very prodigal family, we do, we've all gone in ter double figures, except your Aunt Mary, who only 'ad three--but then she wasn't married, so it didn't count, like.'</p> 
<p>They drank each other's health. Everything was getting blurred to Liza, she was losing her head.</p> 
<p>'Yus,' went on Mrs. Kemp, 'I've 'ad thirteen children an' I'm proud of it. As your poor dear father used ter sy, it shows as 'ow one's got the blood of a Briton in one. Your poor dear father, 'e was a great 'and at speakin' 'e was: 'e used ter speak at parliamentary meetin's--I really believe 'e'd 'ave been a Member of Parliament if 'e'd been alive now. Well, as I was sayin', your father 'e used ter sy, "None of your small families for me, I don't approve of them," says 'e. 'E was a man of very 'igh principles, an' by politics 'e was a Radical. "No," says 'e, when 'e got talkin', "when a man can 'ave a family risin' into double figures, it shows 'e's got the backbone of a Briton in 'im. That's the stuff as 'as built up England's nime and glory! When one thinks of the mighty British Hempire," says 'e, "on which the sun never sets from mornin' till night, one 'as ter be proud of 'isself, an' one 'as ter do one's duty in thet walk of life in which it 'as pleased Providence ter set one--an' every man's fust duty is ter get as many children as 'e bloomin' well can." Lord love yer--'e could talk, I can tell yer.'</p> 
<p>'Drink up, mother,' said Liza. 'You're not 'alf drinkin'.' She flourished the bottle. 'I don't care a twopanny 'ang for all them blokes; I'm quite 'appy, an' I don't want anythin' else.'</p> 
<p>'I can see you're my daughter now,' said Mrs. Kemp. 'When yer used ter round on me I used ter think as 'ow if I 'adn't carried yer for nine months, it must 'ave been some mistike, an' yer wasn't my daughter at all. When you come ter think of it, a man 'e don't know if it's 'is child or somebody else's, but yer can't deceive a woman like thet. Yer couldn't palm off somebody else's kid on 'er.'</p> 
<p>'I am beginnin' ter feel quite lively,' said Liza. 'I dunno wot it is, but I feel as if I wanted to laugh till I fairly split my sides.'</p> 
<p>And she began to sing: 'For 'e's a jolly good feller--for 'e's a jolly good feller!'</p> 
<p>Her dress was all disarranged; her face covered with the scars of scratches, and clots of blood had fixed under her nose; her eye had swollen up so that it was nearly closed, and red; her hair was hanging over her face and shoulders, and she laughed stupidly and leered with heavy, sodden ugliness.</p> 
<p>'Disy, Disy! I can't afford a kerridge. But you'll look neat, on the seat Of a bicycle mide for two.'</p> 
<p>She shouted out the tunes, beating time on the table, and her mother, grinning, with her thin, grey hair hanging dishevelled over her head, joined in with her weak, cracked voice--</p> 
<p>'Oh, dem golden kippers, oh!'</p> 
<p>Then Liza grew more melancholy and broke into 'Auld Lang Syne'.</p> 
<p>'Should old acquaintance be forgot And never brought to mind?</p> 
<p>* * * * *</p> 
<p>For old lang syne'.</p> 
<p>Finally they both grew silent, and in a little while there came a snore from Mrs. Kemp; her head fell forward to her chest; Liza tumbled from her chair on to the bed, and sprawling across it fell asleep.</p> 
<p>'_Although I am drunk and bad, be you kind, Cast a glance at this heart which is bewildered and distressed. O God, take away from my mind my cry and my complaint. Offer wine, and take sorrow from my remembrance. Offer wine._'</p> 
<p>过了几天，丽莎跟萨莉在谈天，萨莉似乎没有丽莎上次看到她的时候那样快活。</p> 
<p>“他不象我原先所想的那样，”她说。“我不妨这样说；不过他有许多地方也忍受着；我看有时候是我不好，而他心眼儿倒是不错的。也许孩子生了下来，他会待我好些。”</p> 
<p>“开心点，萨莉，”丽莎看到过不少夫妻生活情况，她回答说。“你习惯之后就不会觉得那么糟糕，开始时候是令人失望的，但慢慢地你就不放在心上了。”</p> 
<p>谈了一会，萨莉说她必须走了，要去准备她丈夫的茶点。</p> 
<p>她说了再见，接着有点为难地对丽莎说一</p> 
<p>“嗳，丽莎，你自己小心！”</p> 
<p>“我自己小心——为什么？”丽莎诧异地问。</p> 
<p>“你明白我的意思的。”</p> 
<p>“不，我实在不明白。”</p> 
<p>“就是那边那个布莱克斯顿太太，她在候着你。”</p> 
<p>“布莱克斯顿太太！”丽莎吓了一跳。</p> 
<p>“是的，她说只要她能抓到你，她就打你。我劝你小心些。”</p> 
<p>“我？”丽莎说。</p> 
<p>萨莉回转头，故意不朝丽莎的脸看。</p> 
<p>“她说你跟她的老头儿搅在一起。”</p> 
<p>丽莎默不作声，萨莉重又说了声再见，转身就走了。</p> 
<p>丽莎感到一阵彻骨的寒噤。她不止一次看到布莱克斯顿太太那副杀气腾腾的怒容。她总是尽量回避她，但是她没有想到这个女人要对她怎么样。</p> 
<p>她害怕极了，满脸淌着冷汗。</p> 
<p>如果她被布莱克斯顿太太抓到，她将毫无办法，她又小又瘦弱，而那一个是又大又强壮。她不知万一被她抓到了怎么办。</p> 
<p>那天夜里，她把这话告诉了吉姆，说得象是个笑话似的。</p> 
<p>“我说，吉姆，你的老婆——她说她如果找到我，要送些袜子给我穿穿。注”</p> 
<p>“我老婆！你怎么知道？”</p> 
<p>“她在街上对人家说。”</p> 
<p>“好吧，”吉姆说，火冒三丈地，“她敢碰你一根头发，我就揍她，叫她知道我的厉害！老天爷，给我机会，我要教训教训她，我对她那老是直眉瞪眼的样子恨透了！”他一面说，一面握握拳头。</p> 
<p>丽莎是个胆小的姑娘。冤家的威胁始终盘旋在她头脑里，她吓得不大敢出门，只怕碰上了她。她提心吊胆地一直朝前看着，一看见远处有象布莱克斯顿太太的人，就急忙转身。她夜里做梦也梦见她，她看见那个高大、强壮的身影、那横眉怒目的凶恶的脸相，还有那编成一条条辫子的古怪的棕色头发；她时常急哭着醒来，一身大汗。</p> 
<p>在这之后的一个星期六下午。十一月的阴湿天气，路上泥泞，天空灰蒙蒙的，使人精神萎靡。</p> 
<p>三点钟光景，丽莎放工回家，走进维尔街，正匆匆往屋里走，忽然看见布莱克斯顿太太迎面过来。她吓了一大跳。</p> 
<p>她连忙回头走。她从眼角里看到，她背后被那个女人钉着，所以她一直走出了维尔街。她兜了个圈子，目的是想从另一头进入这条小街，她家就在那边口头，她可以不让人看见，溜回家里。</p> 
<p>可是她不敢立刻冒险兜入小街，因为她怕布莱克斯顿太太候在那里；所以等了约摸半个小时。这半个小时不知有多长。</p> 
<p>最后她鼓足勇气，拐过转角，走进了维尔街。她差一点和布莱克斯顿太太撞了个满怀，原来她正站在那小酒店门口附近。</p> 
<p>丽莎一声惊叫，那女人嘲笑她说一</p> 
<p>“你没料到会碰上我，没料到吧？”</p> 
<p>丽莎不答理，只想经她面前走过去。</p> 
<p>布莱克斯顿太太跨前一步，挡住了她的去路。</p> 
<p>“你好象怪急匆匆的，”她说。</p> 
<p>“是呀，我要赶回家去，”丽莎说，又想走过去。</p> 
<p>“可要是我不让你去呢？”布莱克斯顿太太拦住她。</p> 
<p>“你干吗不放我走？”丽莎说。“我没有碍你事！”</p> 
<p>“没有碍我事，你没有吗？那就好！’’</p> 
<p>“让我过去，”丽莎说。“我不要跟你说话。”</p> 
<p>“你不要，我知道，”那一个说，“可我要跟你说话！让我把要对你说的话都说了，才放你过去。”</p> 
<p>丽莎四面看看，寻求解救。</p> 
<p>吵闹刚开始的时候，小酒店周围闲荡的人们只是好奇地看看，后来逐渐聚成了一个小圈子。过路行人加入进来。街上其他的人看见一群人，也赶来看热闹。</p> 
<p>丽莎看见所有人的眼睛都盯着她，男的感到有趣和起劲，女的不但不同情她，而且极为愤慨。丽莎想要求人救助，但是人那么多，而且他们都好象对她那么反感，所以她实在没有求救的勇气。</p> 
<p>她向周围的人群环视了一圈、转脸瞧着布莱克斯顿太太。丽莎站在她面前，浑身发抖，脸色惨白。</p> 
<p>“他不在，他不在这儿，”布莱克斯顿太太嗤笑着对她说，“所以你不用找他。”</p> 
<p>“我不懂你什么意思，”丽莎回答说。“我要走。我没有碍你什么。”</p> 
<p>“没有碍我什么？”那女人勃然大怒，重复她的话说。“我来告诉你，你碍了我什么——你把我的丈夫夺了去，你夺去了我的丈夫。你没把他夺去之前，我跟我丈夫从没吵过一句嘴。现在全是你，你跟他搅在一起，他没有时间顾自己的老婆、顾自己的家——全是你。还有，他的钱。我一个子儿都拿不到；要是没有我早先在银行里储蓄了的那点钱，我和孩子们都要饿死了！这一切都是你造成的！”</p> 
<p>她对她挥挥拳头。</p> 
<p>“我从没有拿过任何人的钱。”</p> 
<p>“别跟我说；我知道你拿了。你这臭狗娘！你该自己晓得不要脸，勾搭结了婚的男人，破坏人家的家庭，人家男人年纪又大得好做你的爷老子。”</p> 
<p>“她这话说得对！”旁边有两个女人说。“她跟别人的丈夫胡搅，不会有好处。”</p> 
<p>“我要给你颜色看！”布莱克斯顿太太继续说，越说越激昂，越冲动，挥舞着拳头，因狂怒而叫喊得嗓子也发哑了。“我这四个星期来一直在候着你。哼，你这婊子——你就是婊子！”</p> 
<p>“我不是！”丽莎气愤地回答。</p> 
<p>“你是的，你是婊子，”布莱克斯顿太太重复说，咄咄逼人地走前一步，丽莎只得后退。“而且，他也把你当婊子。我知道你这眼睛是谁打青的，这就表明他是把你当什么的！他就是把你两只眼睛都打得又青又肿，也是活该！”</p> 
<p>布莱克斯顿太太直站在她面前，坚实的下颚突出着，竖起墨黑的眉毛，凶相毕露。她站着沉默了一会，打量着丽莎，这会儿周围的人屏住了呼吸，看得紧张。</p> 
<p>“你这肮脏的小狗娘，你！”她终于又开口了。“尝尝这个！”她张开手掌，向她面颊上啪的一记响亮的耳光。</p> 
<p>丽莎哇的一声，倒退一步，用手捧住了面颊。</p> 
<p>“再来一个！”布莱克斯顿太太说着，又是一巴掌。然后她在嘴里拌了一口唾沫，吐了丽莎一面孔。</p> 
<p>丽莎纵身向她扑上去，张开手指，象爪子般地深深掐进那女人的脸皮里，然后顺着面颊往下抓。布莱克斯顿太太用双手揪住她的头发，拚命地拉。可是她们一会儿就被拖开了。</p> 
<p>“停！停！”男人中间有几个说。“要规规矩矩地打。不能这样乱抓乱拉。”</p> 
<p>“我跟她打；打好啦！”布莱克斯顿太太卷起袖子，野蛮地注视着她的对手。</p> 
<p>丽莎站在她面前，脸色惨白，浑身发抖。她看看她的敌人．看看她抓出来的一条条血红的指甲印，有两条还在流血，她吓退了。</p> 
<p>“我不要打，”她嘶哑地说。</p> 
<p>“你不要打，我知道你不要打．”那一个发着嘘声说．“可是我非要你打不可！”</p> 
<p>“她比我高大多少，我怎么打得过．”丽莎眼泪汪汪地加上一句。</p> 
<p>“你早该想到这一点。来吧！”说着，布莱克斯顿太太又冲上去。她用两个拳头一个连一个地猛击丽莎。</p> 
<p>丽莎不是招架，而是学那女人的样，也用两个拳头回击。她们这样连续一、两分钟，两人都象风车似地挥拳打对方。但是丽莎敌不过她强劲的手把子，满头满面挨着来得又重又快的拳头。</p> 
<p>她举手遮住了脸，扭转了头，听任布莱克斯顿太太无情的毒打。</p> 
<p>“暂停！”几个男人喊道——“暂停！”于是布莱克斯顿太太停下来休息一下。</p> 
<p>“让她们两个对打不大公平。丽莎不是那么个高大的女人的对手．”人群中有一个男人说。</p> 
<p>“嗯，这怪她自己不好．”一个女人反驳道，“她不应该和那个女人的丈夫胡搅。”</p> 
<p>“不过．我觉得不对，”另一个女人又说，“她挨打得太厉害了。”</p> 
<p>“她这也活该！”一个女人说。“她罪有应得，而且得到加倍的惩罚。”</p> 
<p>“对啊．”又一个女人说；“一个女人不应该勾搭别个女人的丈夫。干了这种事，挨一顿打就算数，还是太便宜了她——照我看来。”</p> 
<p>“我也是这样看法。不过我没有想到这会是丽莎。我从来没想到她是个坏东西。”</p> 
<p>“她这个榜样很好：”一个矮小的黑黝黝的女人说，看上去她是犹太人。“要是她跟我的老头胡搅，我就杀死她——我发誓非杀死她不可！”</p> 
<p>“既然她勾搭了一个，今后她就要勾搭另外的——你瞧着吧。”</p> 
<p>“她识相点不要走近我们家；我也要教训教训她。”</p> 
<p>他们这样你一句我一句的时候，丽莎始终站在这圈子的一个角落里周身发抖，伤心地哭泣着。</p> 
<p>她的一只眼睛肿了起来，头发乱七八糟地披在面孔上。</p> 
<p>两个小伙子以决斗中的助手自居，站在她面前，颇有讽刺意味地安慰着她。一个拎起她的围裙的下角，给她打扇，另一个比划着教她站立和举臂的姿势。</p> 
<p>“你要顶住她，丽莎．”他在说，“退缩不行，你只会更加吃亏。你要还击。打她鼻子，你瞧，就象这样；你必须拿出点劲头来，你知道。”</p> 
<p>丽莎竭力屏住啜泣。</p> 
<p>“对，要打得重，你必须打得重，”另一个说。“如果她占着上风，你就扭住她，揪她的头发，抓她的脸。”</p> 
<p>“你已经抓了她许多指甲印，丽莎。她向你啐唾沫的当儿．你确是猛扑上去了！就该那样干！”</p> 
<p>他又转向他的同伙说——</p> 
<p>“你记得去年我们街上格雷格老大娘跟另‘个女人打架的那一场吗？’’</p> 
<p>“不．”他说，“那一场我没看到。’’</p> 
<p>“那才精彩哪；后来警察来，把她们都抓了起来。”</p> 
<p>丽莎巴不得警察来把她带走；她宁愿进监狱，逃开她面前的恶煞；奈何救星不来。</p> 
<p>“休息时间过了！”裁判员喊道。“继续开打！”</p> 
<p>“当心警察！”有个人喊道。</p> 
<p>．．不用担心警察，”另外一个人回答说。“他们看见发生着什么事情，总是躲躲开的。”</p> 
<p>“继续开打！”</p> 
<p>布莱克斯顿太太疯狂地猛击丽莎；而这姑娘勇敢地站着，一边挨打，一边拼着命还击。</p> 
<p>观众们看得有劲极了。</p> 
<p>“又打中一拳！”他们叫嚷。“再给她一拳，丽莎，好，这一拳打得好！狠狠打！”</p> 
<p>-二比一，老的领先！”一位爱好运动的先生叫道；丽莎觉得观众不在她一边。</p> 
<p>“这回她拼起命来，不是还顶得住吗？”有人大声说。</p> 
<p>“哦，她有点劲头，她有！”</p> 
<p>正在这时候，布莱克斯顿太太一拳打中丽莎的鼻子。</p> 
<p>“这一拳定局了！”他们大叫起来，看看那姑娘摇摇晃晃倒后去，鼻血直淌。</p> 
<p>她愤怒得发了疯，一切恐惧都消失了，向她的敌人直扑上去，拳头象雨点般落在对方鼻子上、眼睛上、嘴巴上。那个女人在这突然的猛攻面前退缩起来，于是那些男人们又叫道一</p> 
<p>“天哪，小的占优势了！”</p> 
<p>但是那个女人很快就镇定下来，扭住丽莎，用指甲深深掐入她的肉里。丽莎狠命抓住她的头发，张开牙齿对着布莱克斯顿太太，要咬她。</p> 
<p>她们这样扭来扭去，抓呀，撕呀，咬呀，两个人互相盯住，眼睛里充满了血和愤怒。观众喝彩、呼喊，拍手叫好。</p> 
<p>“出了什么事？”</p> 
<p>“喂，瞧，”女人中间有人低声说。“她丈夫来了。”</p> 
<p>他踮起脚尖，从人群后面抬头看。</p> 
<p>“我的天哪！”他说，“是丽莎！”</p> 
<p>他粗暴地把人们推开，从人群中挤到圈子中央，插入那两个女人中间，把她们一把拉开。他恶狠狠对着他老婆——</p> 
<p>“好哇，我要好好教训你！”</p> 
<p>接着，他们三个人面面相觑，沉默了一会。</p> 
<p>另一个男人被这人群吸引了过来。他也挤到了里边。</p> 
<p>“回家去，丽莎，”他说。</p> 
<p>“汤姆！”</p> 
<p>他挽着她的手臂，搀扶她走出给她让路的人群。</p> 
<p>他们默默无言地沿着小街走去，汤姆十分沉痛，丽莎哀哀啜泣。</p> 
<p>“噢，汤姆．”她走了一段，抽噎着说，“我不由自主！”然后她泪如潮涌，“我实在爱他呀！”</p> 
<p>他们到达她家门口时，她用哀求的口气说，“进来。”他跟着她到了她房间里。</p> 
<p>一到屋里，她在一张椅子上倒下，大哭起来。</p> 
<p>汤姆拿块手巾，把一端蘸湿了，给她揩干净粘着血和眼泪的面孔。她让他揩，只是抽抽搭搭地呻吟。</p> 
<p>“你待我真好，汤姆。”</p> 
<p>“打起精神来，好姑娘，”他亲切地说，“现在一切都过去了。”</p> 
<p>过了一会，放纵的啼哭停止下来了。她喝了些水，然后拿起一面破镜子，朝自己照照，哀叹道</p> 
<p>“我变成了这个模样！’’</p> 
<p>她开始把头发盘起来。</p> 
<p>“你待我真好，汤姆，”她重复说，依然是抽抽搭搭地。他在她身旁坐下，她握住了他的手。</p> 
<p>“不，我没有做什么，”他回答；“这只是任何人都会做的。”</p> 
<p>“你知道，汤姆，”稍稍沉默后，她说，“上回我在街上碰到你的时候，对你说话不大客气，我很对不起你；你从此没跟我说过话。’’</p> 
<p>“哦，现在这些都成了过去，好姑娘，我们不必再去提它。”</p> 
<p>“啊，可我待你不好。我是个十足的坏东西，的确。”</p> 
<p>他默不作声地捏捏她的手。</p> 
<p>“我说，汤姆，”又停顿了一下之后，她说。“你早已知道那个事情吗？——在今天以前你已经知道了吗？”</p> 
<p>他涨红了脸回答说——</p> 
<p>“是的。”</p> 
<p>她非常悲伤地慢吞吞地说一</p> 
<p>“我早就料你已经知道；我每次碰到你的时候，总看见你那么垂头丧气似的。你当时是爱我的，汤姆，是不是？”</p> 
<p>“我现在也爱着你，亲爱的，”他说。</p> 
<p>“呵，现在太晚了，”她叹息。</p> 
<p>“你知道吗，丽莎，”他说，“我差些踢死一个人，就因为他说你跟他——有关系。”</p> 
<p>“事实上，你是知道我确实是的。”</p> 
<p>“是的——不过我不愿任何人在我面前说这个话。”</p> 
<p>“除了你，汤姆，他们都跟我不对。当时你向我求婚，我答应了你就好了；我答应了你，不会落到今朝的地步。”</p> 
<p>“那末，现在你答应吗？你答应要我吗？”</p> 
<p>“我？出了这事情之后？”</p> 
<p>“哦，我不把这放在心上。只要你嫁给我，我无所谓。我没有你简直没法生活，丽莎——你肯答应吗？”</p> 
<p>她呻吟了一声。</p> 
<p>“不，我不能，汤姆。这不行。”</p> 
<p>“如果我不介意，有什么不行？”</p> 
<p>“汤姆，”她说，沉着头，声音几乎在喉咙里，“我已经有——你知道！’’</p> 
<p>“有什么？”</p> 
<p>她这话实在难以出口——</p> 
<p>“恐怕我已经有孕了。”</p> 
<p>他打了个顿；然后他还是说——</p> 
<p>“唔——只要你嫁给我，我无所谓。”</p> 
<p>“不，我不能，汤姆，”她突然放声大哭，“我不能，可你偏又待我这样好；我愿作出一切来补偿你的恩情。”</p> 
<p>她用双手攀着他的脖子，身子泻到他膝盖上。</p> 
<p>“你知道，汤姆，我现在没法嫁给你了，可是你要我怎样——随便你另外要我怎样，我都愿意，只要使你快活。”</p> 
<p>他不懂丽莎的意思，而只是说——</p> 
<p>“你真是个好姑娘，丽莎，’’他俯下身去在她脑门子上庄重地亲了个吻。</p> 
<p>他叹了口气，把她扶起来坐好，自己站起身来走了。</p> 
<p>她在他把她放下的位子上坐了一会，回想她所经过的一切，孤寂和悲怆使她心情沉重得不禁泪如泉涌。她扑倒在床上，把脸埋在枕头里。</p> 
<p>刚才丽莎跟汤姆走去的时候，吉姆瞧着丽莎，而他的妻子用妒忌的目光盯视着他。</p> 
<p>“你是在想着她。我知道，你当然最好是自己送她回家去，而全不管我。”</p> 
<p>“住口！”吉姆气势汹汹地对她说。</p> 
<p>“我偏要说，”她提高了嗓门回答。“你这个丈夫好哇！口亨，好极啦！丢下老婆和孩子去搞那么个东西！你又是这么一把年纪！你该觉得羞耻。哼，就象跟你自己的女儿在胡搅！”</p> 
<p>“你听着！”他愤怒得咬牙切齿，“你再跟我噜苏，我一脚踢死你！”</p> 
<p>“你们瞧！’’她对着众人说，“你们瞧，他是怎样对待我的！你们听我说！我做了他二十年的妻子，你们哪儿也找不到更好的妻子；我替他生了九个孩子，一次流产还不算，现在又一个快生下来了，而他这样待我！真是个好丈夫，呸！”</p> 
<p>她鄙夷地看看他，接着又面对着周围的人们，仿佛在要他们发表意见。</p> 
<p>“我可不要在这里待到天亮；别跟我胡闹啦！”他把挡住他去路的人们推开；有两个对他的粗暴喝了一声，看看他的凶相，也不敢响了。</p> 
<p>“你们看他！”他的妻子说。“他害怕了，他害怕。看他象条杂种狗，夹着尾巴溜了。呸！’’她跟在他背后，挥舞着臂膀嚷着。</p> 
<p>“你这下流的畜生，你，”她叫骂道；“去跟个小丫头胡搅！呸！</p> 
<p>我但愿你不是我丈夫；我掉在水里，也不愿被人看见跟你淹死在一起。我看见你都恶心。”</p> 
<p>人们在街路两边跟着他们，小心保持着一定距离，但始终认真听着。</p> 
<p>吉姆有一、两次回过头来对她说——</p> 
<p>“住口！”</p> 
<p>可是这反而给她火上加油。</p> 
<p>“我告诉你，我偏要说。我不怕人家知道，知道你是——，你是！我为孩子们有你这样一个做爹的而羞耻。你以为我不知道你那些夜里在干些什么吗？——吊膀子，你，你在吊膀子！你这个好男人，你！”</p> 
<p>吉姆闷声不响，只是向前跑。终于他转过身来，对跟着的人们说一</p> 
<p>“喂，你们跟着干吗？你们好散了，再跟着，我可要给你们点颜色看！”</p> 
<p>他们大多是男孩子和妇女，他们听了他这个话，都退回去了。</p> 
<p>“他不敢对我说一句话，”布莱克斯顿太太讥笑他。“他真是个宝货！”</p> 
<p>吉姆进了家门，她跟在他后面，一直上楼回到房间里。大女儿波莉正在给弟弟妹妹们吃点心。</p> 
<p>当他们看到自己的母亲头发、衣裳弄得一塌糊涂，脸上满是结着的血块和长长的指甲痕，全都吓了一跳。</p> 
<p>“噢，妈妈，”波莉说，“怎么回事？”</p> 
<p>“问他！”她指着她丈夫，回答说。“全是他，叫我得到了这好报应。瞧你们的爸爸，孩子们，你们应该为有这样一个爸爸而骄傲，他把你们丢下不管，让你们饿死，自己拿了一个个星期的工钱，去花在一个肮脏的小婊子身上。”</p> 
<p>吉姆此刻不看见周围有那么许多陌生的眼睛瞅住他了，心里轻松了些。</p> 
<p>“喂，你听着，”他说，“我忍耐到了头了，你当心点。”</p> 
<p>“我不怕你。我知道你恨不得把我杀了，可你杀了我，自己要上绞台。”</p> 
<p>“不，我不要杀死你，不过你再要对我这样无法无天，我要打得你个半死。’’-</p> 
<p>“你敢碰我，”她说；“我控告你。我不管你将服多少个月的苦役。’’</p> 
<p>“闭嘴！”他喝道，同时握紧拳头，对准她胸口狠狠地一拳，把她打得跌跌撞撞。</p> 
<p>“好，你——！”她尖声大叫。</p> 
<p>她抓起火钳，怒不可遏地向他冲去。</p> 
<p>“你来？”他说着，一把抓住火钳，从她手中夺了下来。他把它扔到了房间的另一头，和她扭打起来。</p> 
<p>开始他们扭来扭去，扭了一会，他一下把她拎了起来，向地上扔去；但是她扭住着他，他扑倒在她身上。她的头砰的撞在地上，她急叫；孩子们缩在一个角落里，吓得也急叫起来。</p> 
<p>吉姆揪住他老婆的头，尽往地上撞。</p> 
<p>她叫起救命来，“你要杀死我！救命！救命！”</p> 
<p>波莉惊慌地奔到她父亲身边，拼命想把他拖开。</p> 
<p>“爹，别打她！看上帝份上，千万别打！”</p> 
<p>“放手，”他说，“要不，我也揍你。”</p> 
<p>她抓住他的臂膊，但是吉姆依然跪在他妻子身上，反手对波莉一拳，把她打得差些仰天翻倒。</p> 
<p>“揍你！”</p> 
<p>波莉奔出房门，赶到下面二楼前间，那里有两个男人和两个女人坐着在喝茶。</p> 
<p>“嗨，你们去制止爸爸呀！”她叫道。“他要把妈妈打死了。”</p> 
<p>“怎么，他在怎么样？”</p> 
<p>“噢，他把她揿在地上，把她的头往地上撞。他因为她打了丽莎·肯普而在向她算帐。”</p> 
<p>两个女人中的一个抢上来对她丈夫说——</p> 
<p>“快去，约翰，你去制止他。”</p> 
<p>“不要去，约翰，”另一个男人说。“男人在打老婆的时候，最好不要去劝解。”</p> 
<p>“可是他要打死她了，”波莉重复说，吓得尽是哆嗦。</p> 
<p>“没有的事！”那个男人说；“她打过就好；或许她也活该，谁知道。”</p> 
<p>约翰坐在那儿犹豫不决，一会看看波莉，一会看看他妻子，一会看看另外的那个男人。</p> 
<p>“啊，快呀，快呀——看在上帝份上！”波莉说。</p> 
<p>这时候忽然听见楼上砰的什么东西打碎的声音和女人的尖叫。</p> 
<p>原来布莱克斯顿太太在拼命摆脱她丈夫的挣扎中，撞到了洗脸盆架子上去，脸盆连架子全翻倒了下来。</p> 
<p>“去呀，约翰，”他妻子说。</p> 
<p>“不，我不去，我去也没用，他反而会跟我吵起来。”</p> 
<p>“唉，你真是个胆小鬼，我只能这样说，”他妻子愤慨地说。“可我不能看着一个女人惨遭杀害，我去制止他。”</p> 
<p>说完，她直奔上楼，推门进去。</p> 
<p>吉姆正跪在他老婆身上，恶狠狠地打她，而她呢，用双手挡着头和脸。</p> 
<p>“住手！’’那女人喊道。</p> 
<p>吉姆抬头看看。</p> 
<p>“你是什么人？”他说。</p> 
<p>“住手，我叫你。你这样乱打一个女人，不难为情吗？”</p> 
<p>她跳上前去，抓住他的拳头。</p> 
<p>“放手．”他说，“否则我就给你几下。”</p> 
<p>“你还是别碰我的好，”她说。“你这下流的胆小鬼！哼，你瞧她，她几乎已经没有知觉了。’’</p> 
<p>吉姆住了手，定睛看看他老婆。他站起身子，踢了她一脚。</p> 
<p>“起来l"他说；然而她始终蜷缩在地上，微弱地呻吟着。</p> 
<p>二楼上来的那个女人跪倒下来，双手捧起她的手。</p> 
<p>“不要紧，布莱克斯顿太太。他不会再碰你。这儿，喝一点水吧。”</p> 
<p>她回头转向吉姆，带着无限轻蔑的神气对他说，“你这卑鄙的流氓，你！假如我是个男人，我决不会饶过你。”</p> 
<p>吉姆戴上帽子，往门外一走，反手碰上房门；那女人在背后叫嚷：“滚得远些！”</p> 
<p>“上帝保佑你，”肯普太太说，“是怎么回事啊？”</p> 
<p>她刚回来，开进房门，看见丽莎躺在床上，哭成了个泪人儿，愣了一下。</p> 
<p>丽莎没有回答，只是啼哭，仿佛她的心要碎了。肯普太太走上前去，想看看她的面孔。</p> 
<p>“别哭，亲爱的；告诉我出了什么事。”</p> 
<p>丽莎坐起来，揩揩干眼泪。</p> 
<p>“我好伤心哟！”‘</p> 
<p>“你怎么把脸弄成这个样子啦？唷！”</p> 
<p>“没有什么。”</p> 
<p>“别瞒我！你好端端的不可能把脸弄得这样。”</p> 
<p>“我跟街上那头的一个女人冲突了一下．”丽莎抽噎着说。</p> 
<p>“她打你了，你被打得一塌糊涂——瞧你的眼睛！我带回来一小块肉排，准备明天做菜的，你就切下一片，贴在眼睛上面，很快就好了。，当年我跟你爹吵架，我自己就用这东西的。”</p> 
<p>“噢，我浑身发抖，我的头，噢，我的头痛得可厉害！”</p> 
<p>“我懂得你需要什么，’’肯普太太点点头说。“我正好有着你所需要的东西。”</p> 
<p>她从袋里掏出一只药瓶，拔掉塞子，嗅了嗅。</p> 
<p>“这是好货；决不是你们那种烧酒或者加甲醇的酒精。我不大喝这些东西，而我喝起来，总喜欢是最好的好货。”</p> 
<p>她把瓶子递给丽莎，丽莎喝了一口还给她；她自己也喝了一口，咂着嘴唇。</p> 
<p>“这是好货。再喝一口。”</p> 
<p>“不，”丽莎说，“我不会喝烈酒。”</p> 
<p>她感到昏昏沉沉的，很难过，头里一阵阵剧痛。她但愿能失去了知觉！</p> 
<p>“是的，我知道你不会喝酒，不过，上帝保佑你，那东西对你没有害处。它会给你带来说不完的好处。是呀，我常常在觉得实在精疲力竭、无可奈何的时候，喝一点威士忌或者荷兰酒一一我倒不一定要哪一种烈酒——一喝就精神振作，不能再灵。”</p> 
<p>丽莎又喝了一口，这回稍微多些；它象燃烧着一样从喉咙里下去，一股令人陶醉的热流传遍全身。</p> 
<p>“我喝了这东西的确觉得舒服，”她说，停止了哭泣，擦擦干眼泪，舒了口气。</p> 
<p>“我早就知道你喝了就舒服。相信我的话，要是人们都及时喝口烈酒，各种毛病要少得多。”</p> 
<p>她们默默坐了片刻，接着肯普太太又说一</p> 
<p>“你知道，丽莎，我看我们可以再喝一点。平时你不喝这一类东西，所以我只给自己带来了这一点点，两个人一下就喝光了。但是你好象身体有毛病，我们该多喝一点，肯定对你有好处。”</p> 
<p>“可你又没有装酒的大瓶子。”</p> 
<p>“有，我有，”肯普太太答道，“我有医院里给我的那个瓶。只要把里面的药往垃圾堆里一倒，洗洗干净，我就自己拿到小酒店去买去。”</p> 
<p>丽莎一个人留在家里，开始回顾发生了的事情。她并不觉得象早先那样无限的悲伤，因为她经受的一切似乎已经是遥远的往事。</p> 
<p>“毕竟．”她说，“没有什么不得了的事。”</p> 
<p>肯普太太回来了。</p> 
<p>“再喝一点，丽莎，”她说。</p> 
<p>“好，再喝一点也好。我喝它几杯吗？没错，”她喝了些之后，加上一句，“的确提精神。”</p> 
<p>“对了，丽莎——对了。你非常需要喝酒。你想想看嘛，你跟那个女人打过架！哦，我年轻时候也打过架，不过我完全不象你这样。但愿刚才我在场，我决不会站在旁边看着自己女儿挨打。我虽然已经过了六十五，快六十六了，我还是要对她说：．你敢碰我女儿，就得跟我较量较量，你当心点！”，</p> 
<p>她挥舞起杯子来，这可提醒了她，她把自己的和丽莎</p>
