As soon as her work was over and she had finished tea, Liza would slip out and at some appointed spot meet Jim. Usually it would be at the church, where the Westminster Bridge Road bends down to get to the river, and they would go off, arm-in-arm, till they came to some place where they could sit down and rest. Sometimes they would walk along the Albert Embankment to Battersea Park, and here sit on the benches, watching the children play. The female cyclist had almost abandoned Battersea for the parks on the other side of the river, but often enough one went by, and Liza, with the old-fashioned prejudice of her class, would look after the rider and make some remark about her, not seldom more forcible than ladylike. Both Jim and she liked children, and, tiny, ragged urchins would gather round to have rides on the man's knees or mock fights with Liza.</p> 
<p>They thought themselves far away from anyone in Vere Street, but twice, as they were walking along, they were met by people they knew. Once it was two workmen coming home from a job at Vauxhall: Liza did not see them till they were quite near; she immediately dropped Jim's arm, and they both cast their eyes to the ground as the men passed, like ostriches, expecting that if they did not look they would not be seen.</p> 
<p>'D'you see 'em, Jim?' asked Liza, in a whisper, when they had gone by. 'I wonder if they see us.' Almost instinctively she turned round, and at the same moment one of the men turned too; then there was no doubt about it.</p> 
<p>'Thet did give me a turn,' she said.</p> 
<p>'So it did me,' answered Jim; 'I simply went 'ot all over.'</p> 
<p>'We was bally fools,' said Liza; 'we oughter 'ave spoken to 'em! D'you think they'll let aht?'</p> 
<p>They heard nothing of it, when Jim afterwards met one of the men in a public-house he did not mention a meeting, and they thought that perhaps they had not been recognized. But the second time was worse.</p> 
<p>It was on the Albert Embankment again. They were met by a party of four, all of whom lived in the street. Liza's heart sank within her, for there was no chance of escape; she thought of turning quickly and walking in the opposite direction, but there was not time, for the men had already seen them. She whispered to Jim:</p> 
<p>'Back us up,' and as they met she said to one of the men:</p> 
<p>''Ulloa there! Where are you off to?'</p> 
<p>The men stopped, and one of them asked the question back.</p> 
<p>'Where are you off to?'</p> 
<p>'Me? Oh, I've just been to the 'orspital. One of the gals at our place is queer, an' so I says ter myself, "I'll go an' see 'er."' She faltered a little as she began, but quickly gathered herself together, lying fluently and without hesitation.</p> 
<p>'An' when I come aht,' she went on, ''oo should I see just passin' the 'orspital but this 'ere cove, an' 'e says to me, "Wot cheer," says 'e, "I'm goin' ter Vaux'all, come an' walk a bit of the wy with us." "Arright," says I, "I don't mind if I do."'</p> 
<p>One man winked, and another said: 'Go it, Liza!'</p> 
<p>She fired up with the dignity of outraged innocence.</p> 
<p>'Wot d'yer mean by thet?' she said; 'd'yer think I'm kiddin'?'</p> 
<p>'Kiddin'? No! You've only just come up from the country, ain't yer?'</p> 
<p>'Think I'm kidding? What d'yer think I want ter kid for? Liars never believe anyone, thet's fact.'</p> 
<p>'Na then, Liza, don't be saucy.'</p> 
<p>'Saucy! I'll smack yer in the eye if yer sy much ter me. Come on,' she said to Jim, who had been standing sheepishly by; and they walked away.</p> 
<p>The men shouted: 'Now we shan't be long!' and went off laughing.</p> 
<p>After that they decided to go where there was no chance at all of their being seen. They did not meet till they got over Westminster Bridge, and thence they made their way into the park; they would lie down on the grass in one another's arms, and thus spend the long summer evenings. After the heat of the day there would be a gentle breeze in the park, and they would take in long breaths of the air; it seemed far away from London, it was so quiet and cool; and Liza, as she lay by Jim's side, felt her love for him overflowing to the rest of the world and enveloping mankind itself in a kind of grateful happiness. If it could only have lasted! They would stay and see the stars shine out dimly, one by one, from the blue sky, till it grew late and the blue darkened into black, and the stars glittered in thousands all above them. But as the nights grew cooler, they found it cold on the grass, and the time they had there seemed too short for the long journey they had to make; so, crossing the bridge as before, they strolled along the Embankment till they came to a vacant bench, and there they would sit, with Liza nestling close up to her lover and his great arms around her. The rain of September made no difference to them; they went as usual to their seat beneath the trees, and Jim would take Liza on his knee, and, opening his coat, shelter her with it, while she, with her arms round his neck, pressed very close to him, and occasionally gave a little laugh of pleasure and delight. They hardly spoke at all through these evenings, for what had they to say to one another? Often without exchanging a word they would sit for an hour with their faces touching, the one feeling on his cheek the hot breath from the other's mouth; while at the end of the time the only motion was an upraising of Liza's lips, a bending down of Jim's, so that they might meet and kiss. Sometimes Liza fell into a light doze, and Jim would sit very still for fear of waking her, and when she roused herself she would smile, while he bent down again and kissed her. They were very happy. But the hours passed by so quickly, that Big Ben striking twelve came upon them as a surprise, and unwillingly they got up and made their way homewards; their partings were never ending--each evening Jim refused to let her go from his arms, and tears stood in his eyes at the thought of the separation.</p> 
<p>'I'd give somethin',' he would say, 'if we could be togither always.'</p> 
<p>'Never mind, old chap!' Liza would answer, herself half crying, 'it can't be 'elped, so we must jolly well lump it.'</p> 
<p>But notwithstanding all their precautions people in Vere Street appeared to know. First of all Liza noticed that the women did not seem quite so cordial as before, and she often fancied they were talking of her; when she passed by they appeared to look at her, then say something or other, and perhaps burst out laughing; but when she approached they would immediately stop speaking, and keep silence in a rather awkward, constrained manner. For a long time she was unwilling to believe that there was any change in them, and Jim who had observed nothing, persuaded her that it was all fancy. But gradually it became clearer, and Jim had to agree with her that somehow or other people had found out. Once when Liza had been talking to Polly, Jim's daughter, Mrs. Blakeston had called her, and when the girl had come to her mother Liza saw that she spoke angrily, and they both looked across at her. When Liza caught Mrs. Blakeston's eye she saw in her face a surly scowl, which almost frightened her; she wanted to brave it out, and stepped forward a little to go and speak with the woman, but Mrs. Blakeston, standing still, looked so angrily at her that she was afraid to. When she told Jim his face grew dark, and he said: 'Blast the woman! I'll give 'er wot for if she says anythin' ter you.'</p> 
<p>'Don't strike 'er, wotever 'appens, will yer, Jim?' said Liza.</p> 
<p>'She'd better tike care then!' he answered, and he told her that lately his wife had been sulking, and not speaking to him. The previous night, on coming home after the day's work and bidding her 'Good evenin',' she had turned her back on him without answering.</p> 
<p>'Can't you answer when you're spoke to?' he had said.</p> 
<p>'Good evenin',' she had replied sulkily, with her back still turned.</p> 
<p>After that Liza noticed that Polly avoided her.</p> 
<p>'Wot's up, Polly?' she said to her one day. 'You never speaks now; 'ave you 'ad yer tongue cut aht?'</p> 
<p>'Me? I ain't got nothin' ter speak abaht, thet I knows of,' answered Polly, abruptly walking off. Liza grew very red and quickly looked to see if anyone had noticed the incident. A couple of youths, sitting on the pavement, had seen it, and she saw them nudge one another and wink.</p> 
<p>Then the fellows about the street began to chaff her.</p> 
<p>'You look pale,' said one of a group to her one day.</p> 
<p>'You're overworkin' yerself, you are,' said another.</p> 
<p>'Married life don't agree with Liza, thet's wot it is,' added a third.</p> 
<p>''Oo d'yer think yer gettin' at? I ain't married, an' never like ter be,' she answered.</p> 
<p>'Liza 'as all the pleasures of a 'usband an' none of the trouble.'</p> 
<p>'Bli'me if I know wot yer mean!' said Liza.</p> 
<p>'Na, of course not; you don't know nothin', do yer?'</p> 
<p>'Innocent as a bibe. Our Father which art in 'eaven!'</p> 
<p>''Aven't been in London long, 'ave yer?'</p> 
<p>They spoke in chorus, and Liza stood in front of them, bewildered, not knowing what to answer.</p> 
<p>'Don't you mike no mistake abaht it, Liza knows a thing or two.'</p> 
<p>'O me darlin', I love yer fit to kill, but tike care your missus ain't round the corner.' This was particularly bold, and they all laughed.</p> 
<p>Liza felt very uncomfortable, and fiddled about with her apron, wondering how she should get away.</p> 
<p>'Tike care yer don't git into trouble, thet's all,' said one of the men, with burlesque gravity.</p> 
<p>'Yer might give us a chanst, Liza, you come aht with me one evenin'. You oughter give us all a turn, just ter show there's no ill-feelin'.'</p> 
<p>'Bli'me if I know wot yer all talkin' abaht. You're all barmy on the crumpet,' said Liza indignantly, and, turning her back on them, made for home.</p> 
<p>Among other things that had happened was Sally's marriage. One Saturday a little procession had started from Vere Street, consisting of Sally, in a state of giggling excitement, her fringe magnificent after a whole week of curling-papers, clad in a perfectly new velveteen dress of the colour known as electric blue; and Harry, rather nervous and ill at ease in the unaccustomed restraint of a collar; these two walked arm-in-arm, and were followed by Sally's mother and uncle, also arm-in-arm, and the procession was brought up by Harry's brother and a friend. They started with a flourish of trumpets and an old boot, and walked down the middle of Vere Street, accompanied by the neighbours' good wishes; but as they got into the Westminster Bridge Road and nearer to the church, the happy couple grew silent, and Harry began to perspire freely, so that his collar gave him perfect torture. There was a public-house just opposite the church, and it was suggested that they should have a drink before going in. As it was a solemn occasion they went into the private bar, and there Sally's uncle, who was a man of means, ordered six pots of beer.</p> 
<p>'Feel a bit nervous, 'Arry?' asked his friend.</p> 
<p>'Na,' said Harry, as if he had been used to getting married every day of his life; 'bit warm, thet's all.'</p> 
<p>'Your very good 'ealth, Sally,' said her mother, lifting her mug; 'this is the last time as I shall ever address you as miss.'</p> 
<p>'An' may she be as good a wife as you was,' added Sally's uncle.</p> 
<p>'Well, I don't think my old man ever 'ad no complaint ter mike abaht me. I did my duty by 'im, although it's me as says it,' answered the good lady.</p> 
<p>'Well, mates,' said Harry's brother, 'I reckon it's abaht time to go in. So 'ere's to the 'ealth of Mr. 'Enry Atkins an' 'is future missus.'</p> 
<p>'An' God bless 'em!' said Sally's mother.</p> 
<p>Then they went into the church, and as they solemnly walked up the aisle a pale-faced young curate came out of the vestry and down to the bottom of the chancel. The beer had had a calming effect on their troubled minds, and both Harry and Sally began to think it rather a good joke. They smiled on each other, and at those parts of the service which they thought suggestive violently nudged one another in the ribs. When the ring had to be produced, Harry fumbled about in different pockets, and his brother whispered:</p> 
<p>'Swop me bob, 'e's gone and lorst it!'</p> 
<p>However, all went right, and Sally having carefully pocketed the certificate, they went out and had another drink to celebrate the happy event.</p> 
<p>In the evening Liza and several friends came into the couple's room, which they had taken in the same house as Sally had lived in before, and drank the health of the bride and bridegroom till they thought fit to retire.</p> 
<p>一个爱情和欢乐的时期这样开始了。</p> 
<p>丽莎一下班，吃好点心，就往外溜，到什么约定的地方去碰头吉姆。通常是在教堂附近，威斯敏斯特桥大道在那里弯向泰晤士河。他们常携手闲荡，直到有什么地方可以坐下休息。</p> 
<p>有时候，她沿着亚尔培堤走到巴特西公园注，在那里凳子上坐下，看孩子们玩耍。骑自行车的女性注已经不大到巴特西来，而到对岸的那些公园里去了，但是还不时有一辆经过，丽莎带着老派的偏见，常看着骑车的过去，背后议论，说话常粗野得不象个上等女人。</p> 
<p>吉姆和丽莎俩都喜欢孩子，那些很小的破衣烂衫的小鬼常来绕着他们，要在吉姆的膝盖上骑马，或者跟丽莎假打架。</p> 
<p>他们觉得自己是跟维尔街的人们离得远远的了，可是有两次，他们正在路上走，却被他们认识的人碰到了。</p> 
<p>一次是两个工人正从沃克斯霍尔注完工回家，到他们走得很近的时候，丽莎才看见他们；她急忙把吉姆的臂膀甩掉．两个人在对方走过身边的时候都把眼睛朝着地上，象鸵鸟一样，以为只要你不看，就不会被人看见。</p> 
<p>“你看见他们吗，吉姆？”他们走过以后，丽莎轻轻问。“恐怕他们没看见我们。”</p> 
<p>她几乎本能地回过头去，正好那两个男人中的一个也回过头来；那就没有疑问了。</p> 
<p>“真吓了我一跳，”她说。</p> 
<p>“我也是，”吉姆回答；“我浑身一阵火热。”</p> 
<p>“我们真是傻瓜，”丽莎说；“我们该招呼他们！你看他们会传出去吗？”</p> 
<p>他们一点也没有听到什么。后来吉姆在小酒店遇到那两个人中的一个，他也没提起碰到过他。他们想，大概他们没有被认出来。</p> 
<p>然而第二次糟了。</p> 
<p>这回又是在亚尔培堤上。他们碰上了一伙四个人，都是住在一条街上的。丽莎的心往下沉了，因为逃避已经不可能。她想连忙回头跑，可是那几个人早已看到他们了。</p> 
<p>她小声对吉姆说——</p> 
<p>“壮起胆来。”所以他们走到面前的时候，她对其中的一个说，“喂！你们上哪儿去？”</p> 
<p>这几个人停了下来，其中一个反过来问——</p> 
<p>“你们上哪儿去？”</p> 
<p>“我吗？哦，我刚到医院去。厂里有个姑娘不舒服，所以我想，我该去看看她。”</p> 
<p>她开始说话的时候，有点结结巴巴，可很快就镇静下来，谎话说得挺利落，没有丝毫吞吞吐吐的。</p> 
<p>“我医院里出来，”她继续说，“准知道正好这家伙经过医院，他对我说‘你好！’他说，‘我到沃克斯霍尔去，我们一起走一段，好吗？’‘好，’我说，‘一起走也好嘛。’”</p> 
<p>一个人做了个眼色，另一个说，“得了吧，丽莎！”</p> 
<p>她做出清白受污辱的神气而火冒起来。</p> 
<p>“你这是什么意思？”她说；“你以为我在骗人？”</p> 
<p>“骗人？不！你是刚从乡下来的老实人，是不是？”</p> 
<p>“你以为我骗人？你说我为什么要骗人？自己说谎的人从来不相信别人，那倒是千真万确的。”</p> 
<p>“好吧，丽莎，别那么泼辣。”</p> 
<p>“泼辣！你再说，我打肿你的眼睛。我们走．”她对局促不安地站在旁边的吉姆说；他们走了。</p> 
<p>这些人叫嚷着，“我们不用等多久，就有好戏看。”他们嘻嘻哈哈地也走了。</p> 
<p>从那一回以后，他们决定拣绝对没有人看见的地方去。他们一定要过了威斯敏斯特桥才碰头，然后才同到巴特西公园。他们总是卧在草地上，相互偎依着，这样度过了一个个漫长的夏夜。</p> 
<p>白天的闷热过去之后，公园里微风习习，他们痛快地呼吸着凉爽的空气。这儿似乎远离了伦敦，又清静，又凉快。丽莎躺在吉姆身旁，只觉得她在一种醉人的欢乐之中，她对他的爱情泛溢到整个世界，把整个人类都沉浸在里面。但愿好景常在！</p> 
<p>他们常尽是待着，看一颗颗星星在蔚蓝的空中熹微地闪现出来，直到深夜，蔚蓝变成漆黑，满天千万颗星照耀在他们头顶。</p> 
<p>但是随着夜间逐渐转凉，他们觉得躺在草地上冷了，同时又觉得走了那么长的路来到这里，逗留的时间也似乎太短。所以他们同原先一样，过了桥沿着亚尔培堤漫步，看见有空凳子，就在那里坐下。丽莎蜷缩在她情人的怀里，他的粗大的臂膀抱着她。</p> 
<p>九月的雨并不影响他们；他们跟平常一样，来到他们树下的位子上，吉姆会把丽莎抱在膝盖上，张开自己的外套，给她遮雨，而她呢，两臂挽住他的脖子，紧挨着他，偶尔格格地发出一声欢乐和愉快的笑声。</p> 
<p>这些漫长的夜晚，他们竟不大说话；事实上，他们有什么可交谈的呢？他们常默默无言地两人贴着脸，坐上一个小时，彼此的面颊上都感觉到对方嘴里热烘烘的呼吸，而到临了，唯一的动作就是丽莎的嘴唇往上一抬，吉姆的嘴唇凑上去，两人的嘴唇就这样合在一起，接吻。</p> 
<p>有时候丽莎微微睡着了，吉姆总一动不动地坐在那儿，只怕惊醒了她。她自己醒来的时候，常嫣然一笑，他又俯下身子去吻她。他们真是快乐。</p> 
<p>可是时间过得那么快，不知不觉大鹏钟敲起了十二点。他们只好勉强站起身来，回家走了。</p> 
<p>他们的分手是没完没了的——每天晚上吉姆死抱住她，不肯放手，他想到分离就热泪盈眶。</p> 
<p>“只要我们能永远在一起，”他说，“要我怎么样我都情愿。”</p> 
<p>“别烦恼，老朋友！”丽莎自己含着眼泪哭出来，回答说，“这也没有办法．所以我们只能好好忍受。”</p> 
<p>但是尽管他们谨慎小心，维尔街的人们还是都知道了。</p> 
<p>首先，丽莎觉察到那些女人似乎不象以前那样对她亲热了，而且她常常觉得她们在谈论她。她经过的时候，她们好象瞧着她，然后讲些什么，或者还放声大笑，而她走近她们的时候，她们立刻停止说话，局促不安地缄默了。</p> 
<p>她有很长一段时期，一直不愿相信她们对她的态度变了。吉姆是什么也没有觉察到，还向她劝说，说那全都是她的想象。可是后来越来越明显，吉姆也不得不同意丽莎的想法，觉得人们确实已经不知怎么发现了他们的秘密。</p> 
<p>有一回，丽莎在跟吉姆的女儿波莉谈话，布莱克斯顿太太把她叫了去。波莉到了她母亲跟前，丽莎看见那女人怒冲冲地说了些什么，接着母女俩都远远瞧着她。丽莎看见布莱克斯顿太太目光对着她，脸上一副阴冷的怒容几乎使她惊骇。她硬着头皮走前几步，去招呼那女人，可是布莱克斯顿太太动也不动地站着，恶狠狠地瞧着她，吓得她不敢开口。</p> 
<p>她告诉了吉姆，他气得脸色发青，说道，“那个女人该死！要是她对你说了什么，我就揍她。”</p> 
<p>“无论怎么样都不要打她，吉姆，好吗？”丽莎说。</p> 
<p>“那她就得识相！”他回答。</p> 
<p>他告诉她，近来他老婆在发脾气，不跟他说话。上一天夜里，他一天工作完毕回家，向她道“晚安’’，她扭转了头，睬也不睬他。</p> 
<p>“我跟你说话，你不能回一声吗？”当时他说。</p> 
<p>“晚安，”她回答了，死样怪气地，依旧不回头。</p> 
<p>从那一回之后，丽莎觉得波莉总是回避她。</p> 
<p>“怎么啦，波莉？”有一天她对她说。“你现在一句话也不说了；你把舌头给人割掉了吗？”</p> 
<p>“我？我没有什么好说的，我知道，”波莉回答，一面转身就走。</p> 
<p>丽莎面孔涨得通红，急忙看看周围有没有人注意到这情况。有两个小伙子坐在人行道上，看到了。她看见他们彼此用臂肘轻轻碰碰，眨眨眼睛。</p> 
<p>后来，这条小街上的人们开始跟她开起玩笑来。</p> 
<p>“你脸色苍白”，有一天，一群人中有一个对她说。</p> 
<p>“你干得太卖力了，准是的，”另一个说。</p> 
<p>“问题是结婚生活对丽莎不合适，’’第三个加上一句。</p> 
<p>“你在跟谁说话？我没有结婚，我从来不要结婚，”她回答。</p> 
<p>“丽莎有丈夫可能给她的一切欢乐，而没有丈夫可能给她的任何麻烦。”</p> 
<p>“我不懂你在说些什么！”丽莎说。</p> 
<p>“不，你当然不懂，你是一点也不懂的，对吗？”</p> 
<p>“象婴儿一样天真。我们在天上的父啊！注”</p> 
<p>“在伦敦还待得不久吧？”</p> 
<p>他们一吹一唱的，丽莎站在他们面前，茫然无从接嘴。</p> 
<p>“你别弄错了，丽莎是懂得点儿的。”</p> 
<p>“啊，我亲爱的，我爱你，恨不得把你杀了，可要当心不要你的老婆就在转角处。”这个话说得特别大胆，因此大伙都哈哈大笑。</p> 
<p>丽莎狼狈不堪，尽摸弄着她的围裙，不知该怎么脱身。</p> 
<p>“当心别招祸，那倒是最要紧的，”一个男人用一本正经的口气开玩笑。</p> 
<p>“你也给我们个机会，丽莎；几时晚上你跟我也一起出去一次。你应该让我们每个人都挨到一次，表示你对我们一视同仁。”</p> 
<p>“你们都在说些什么，我完全莫名其妙。你们都昏了头。”丽莎愤慨地说完，就转身朝家里走。</p> 
<p>另外发生的事情中，还有萨莉的结婚。</p> 
<p>有个星期六，一个小小的行列从维尔街出发。行列中，萨莉兴奋得尽是傻笑，前刘海用卷发纸卷了一个星期，显得异常漂亮；她穿着一身簇新的棉绒衣服，颜色是所谓电光蓝的。还有哈利，神经有点紧张，颈项里裹着不习惯的硬领，很不自在。他们俩携手并行，后面跟着萨莉的母亲和舅舅，也是手挽着手。行列由哈利的哥哥和一个朋友领头。</p> 
<p>他们在一阵喇叭声中扔了一只旧皮靴注而出发，在维尔街街心上行进，一路受到邻居们的祝贺。可是他们进入威斯敏斯特桥大道，渐渐在走近教堂的时候，这对幸福的新人不作声了，哈利开始汗流如注，因而他的硬领真使他受罪。</p> 
<p>就在教堂对面有家小酒店，于是有人建议在进教堂之前先喝上一杯。因为这是个严肃的时刻，所以他们进入里边的小房间，萨莉的舅舅是有钱人，他叫了六罐啤酒。</p> 
<p>“觉得有点紧张吧，哈利？”他的朋友问。</p> 
<p>“不，”哈利说，仿佛他已经习惯于一生天天做新郎似的；“就是热一点。”</p> 
<p>“祝你身体健康，萨莉，”她母亲举杯说；“这回是我最后一次称你姑娘了。”</p> 
<p>“愿她象你一样做个好妻子，”萨莉的舅舅说。</p> 
<p>“嗯，我想我的老头儿对我从来没有一句抱怨的话。我尽到了我对他的责任，虽然这是我自己说的。”那位善良的老太太说。</p> 
<p>“好吧，朋友们，”哈利的哥哥说，“我看时间差不多．要进教堂了。所以我这儿向亨利·阿特金斯注和他未来的夫人敬一杯。祝他们身体健康。”</p> 
<p>“还愿上帝保佑他们！”萨莉的母亲说。</p> 
<p>然后他们进入了教堂。</p> 
<p>在他们严肃地在通道上向前走去的时候，一个脸色苍白的年轻副牧师从法衣室里出来，走到圣坛脚下。</p> 
<p>啤酒对他们纷乱的心情有镇定作用，这会儿哈利和萨莉俩都觉得这玩意实在是大笑话。他们相视微笑，碰到礼拜式中有些他们觉得有暗示性处，彼此用臂肘猛触对方的肋骨。到要拿出戒指的时候，哈利在一只只口袋里乱摸。他哥哥在旁轻声地说——</p> 
<p>“该死，他准丢掉了！”</p> 
<p>然而一切还是顺利进行。萨莉小心翼翼地放好了结婚证书之后，他们走出教堂，又去喝一杯酒，庆祝这大喜事。</p> 
<p>晚上，丽莎和几个朋友来到这对新人屋里。他们的新房就借在萨莉原来住的同一幢房子里。他们喝酒祝贺新郎新娘身体健康，直闹到他们认为该是告辞了的时候。</p>
