Liza when she was dressing herself in the morning, felt the hardness of fate in the impossibility of eating one's cake and having it; she wished she had reserved her new dress, and had still before her the sensation of a first appearance in it. With a sigh she put on her ordinary everyday working dress, and proceeded to get the breakfast ready, for her mother had been out late the previous night, celebrating the new arrivals in the street, and had the 'rheumatics' this morning.</p> 
<p>'Oo, my 'ead!' she was saying, as she pressed her hands on each side of her forehead. 'I've got the neuralgy again, wot shall I do? I dunno 'ow it is, but it always comes on Sunday mornings. Oo, an' my rheumatics, they give me sich a doin' in the night!'</p> 
<p>'You'd better go to the 'orspital mother.'</p> 
<p>'Not I!' answered the worthy lady, with great decision. 'You 'as a dozen young chaps messin' you abaht, and lookin' at yer, and then they tells yer ter leave off beer and spirrits. Well, wot I says, I says I can't do withaht my glass of beer.' She thumped her pillow to emphasize the statement.</p> 
<p>'Wot with the work I 'ave ter do, lookin' after you and the cookin' and gettin' everythin' ready and doin' all the 'ouse-work, and goin' aht charring besides--well, I says, if I don't 'ave a drop of beer, I says, ter pull me together, I should be under the turf in no time.'</p> 
<p>She munched her bread-and-butter and drank her tea.</p> 
<p>'When you've done breakfast, Liza,' she said, 'you can give the grate a cleanin', an' my boots'd do with a bit of polishin'. Mrs. Tike, in the next 'ouse, 'll give yer some blackin'.'</p> 
<p>She remained silent for a bit, then said:</p> 
<p>'I don't think I shall get up ter-day. Liza. My rheumatics is bad. You can put the room straight and cook the dinner.'</p> 
<p>'Arright, mother, you stay where you are, an' I'll do everythin' for yer.'</p> 
<p>'Well, it's only wot yer ought to do, considerin' all the trouble you've been ter me when you was young, and considerin' thet when you was born the doctor thought I never should get through it. Wot 'ave you done with your week's money, Liza?'</p> 
<p>'Oh, I've put it awy,' answered Liza quietly.</p> 
<p>'Where?' asked her mother.</p> 
<p>'Where it'll be safe.'</p> 
<p>'Where's that?'</p> 
<p>Liza was driven into a corner.</p> 
<p>'Why d'you want ter know?' she asked.</p> 
<p>'Why shouldn't I know; d'you think I want ter steal it from yer?'</p> 
<p>'Na, not thet.'</p> 
<p>'Well, why won't you tell me?'</p> 
<p>'Oh, a thing's sifer when only one person knows where it is.'</p> 
<p>This was a very discreet remark, but it set Mrs. Kemp in a whirlwind of passion. She raised herself and sat up in the bed, flourishing her clenched fist at her daughter.</p> 
<p>'I know wot yer mean, you ---- you!' Her language was emphatic, her epithets picturesque, but too forcible for reproduction. 'You think I'd steal it,' she went on. 'I know yer! D'yer think I'd go an' tike yer dirty money?'</p> 
<p>'Well, mother,' said Liza, 'when I've told yer before, the money's perspired like.'</p> 
<p>'Wot d'yer mean?'</p> 
<p>'It got less.'</p> 
<p>'Well, I can't 'elp thet, can I? Anyone can come in 'ere and tike the money.'</p> 
<p>'If it's 'idden awy, they can't, can they, mother?' said Liza.</p> 
<p>Mrs. Kemp shook her fist.</p> 
<p>'You dirty slut, you,' she said, 'yer think I tike yer money! Why, you ought ter give it me every week instead of savin' it up and spendin' it on all sorts of muck, while I 'ave ter grind my very bones down to keep yer.'</p> 
<p>'Yer know, mother, if I didn't 'ave a little bit saved up, we should be rather short when you're dahn in yer luck.'</p> 
<p>Mrs. Kemp's money always ran out on Tuesday, and Liza had to keep things going till the following Saturday.</p> 
<p>'Oh, don't talk ter me!' proceeded Mrs. Kemp. 'When I was a girl I give all my money ter my mother. She never 'ad ter ask me for nothin'. On Saturday when I come 'ome with my wiges, I give it 'er every farthin'. That's wot a daughter ought ter do. I can say this for myself, I be'aved by my mother like a gal should. None of your prodigal sons for me! She didn't 'ave ter ask me for three 'apence ter get a drop of beer.'</p> 
<p>Liza was wise in her generation; she held her tongue, and put on her hat.</p> 
<p>'Now, you're goin' aht, and leavin' me; I dunno wot you get up to in the street with all those men. No good, I'll be bound. An' 'ere am I left alone, an' I might die for all you care.'</p> 
<p>In her sorrow at herself the old lady began to cry, and Liza slipped out of the room and into the street.</p> 
<p>Leaning against the wall of the opposite house was Tom; he came towards her.</p> 
<p>''Ulloa!' she said, as she saw him. 'Wot are you doin' 'ere?'</p> 
<p>'I was waitin' for you ter come aht, Liza,' he answered.</p> 
<p>She looked at him quickly.</p> 
<p>'I ain't comin' aht with yer ter-day, if thet's wot yer mean,' she said.</p> 
<p>'I never thought of arskin' yer, Liza--after wot you said ter me last night.'</p> 
<p>His voice was a little sad, and she felt so sorry for him.</p> 
<p>'But yer did want ter speak ter me, didn't yer, Tom?' she said, more gently.</p> 
<p>'You've got a day off ter-morrow, ain't yer?'</p> 
<p>'Bank 'Oliday. Yus! Why?'</p> 
<p>'Why, 'cause they've got a drag startin' from the "Red Lion" that's goin' down ter Chingford for the day--an' I'm goin'.'</p> 
<p>'Yus!' she said.</p> 
<p>He looked at her doubtfully.</p> 
<p>'Will yer come too, Liza? It'll be a regular beeno; there's only goin' ter be people in the street. Eh, Liza?'</p> 
<p>'Na, I can't.'</p> 
<p>'Why not?'</p> 
<p>'I ain't got--I ain't got the ooftish.'</p> 
<p>'I mean, won't yer come with me?'</p> 
<p>'Na, Tom, thank yer; I can't do thet neither.'</p> 
<p>'Yer might as well, Liza; it wouldn't 'urt yer.'</p> 
<p>'Na, it wouldn't be right like; I can't come aht with yer, and then mean nothin'! It would be doin' yer aht of an outing.'</p> 
<p>'I don't see why,' he said, very crestfallen.</p> 
<p>'I can't go on keepin' company with you--after what I said last night.'</p> 
<p>'I shan't enjoy it a bit without you, Liza.'</p> 
<p>'You git somebody else, Tom. You'll do withaht me all right.'</p> 
<p>She nodded to him, and walked up the street to the house of her friend Sally. Having arrived in front of it, she put her hands to her mouth in trumpet form, and shouted:</p> 
<p>''I! 'I! 'I! Sally!'</p> 
<p>A couple of fellows standing by copied her.</p> 
<p>''I! 'I! 'I! Sally!'</p> 
<p>'Garn!' said Liza, looking round at them.</p> 
<p>Sally did not appear and she repeated her call. The men imitated her, and half a dozen took it up, so that there was enough noise to wake the seven sleepers.</p> 
<p>''I! 'I! 'I! Sally!'</p> 
<p>A head was put out of a top window, and Liza, taking off her hat, waved it, crying:</p> 
<p>'Come on dahn, Sally!'</p> 
<p>'Arright, old gal!' shouted the other. 'I'm comin'!'</p> 
<p>'So's Christmas!' was Liza's repartee.</p> 
<p>There was a clatter down the stairs, and Sally, rushing through the passage, threw herself on to her friend. They began fooling, in reminiscence of a melodrama they had lately seen together.</p> 
<p>'Oh, my darlin' duck!' said Liza, kissing her and pressing her, with affected rapture, to her bosom.</p> 
<p>'My sweetest sweet!' replied Sally, copying her.</p> 
<p>'An' 'ow does your lidyship ter-day?'</p> 
<p>'Oh!'--with immense languor--'fust class; and is your royal 'ighness quite well?'</p> 
<p>'I deeply regret,' answered Liza, 'but my royal 'ighness 'as got the collywobbles.'</p> 
<p>Sally was a small, thin girl, with sandy hair and blue eyes, and a very freckled complexion. She had an enormous mouth, with terrible, square teeth set wide apart, which looked as if they could masticate an iron bar. She was dressed like Liza, in a shortish black skirt and an old-fashioned bodice, green and grey and yellow with age; her sleeves were tucked up to the elbow, and she wore a singularly dirty apron, that had once been white.</p> 
<p>'Wot 'ave you got yer 'air in them things for?' asked Liza, pointing to the curl-papers. 'Goin' aht with yer young man ter-day?'</p> 
<p>'No, I'm going ter stay 'ere all day.'</p> 
<p>'Wot for, then?'</p> 
<p>'Why, 'Arry's going ter tike me ter Chingford ter-morrer.'</p> 
<p>'Oh? In the "Red Lion" brake?'</p> 
<p>'Yus. Are you goin'?'</p> 
<p>'Na!'</p> 
<p>'Not! Well, why don't you get round Tom? 'E'll tike yer, and jolly glad 'e'll be, too.'</p> 
<p>''E arst me ter go with 'im, but I wouldn't.'</p> 
<p>'Swop me bob--why not?'</p> 
<p>'I ain't keeping company with 'im.'</p> 
<p>'Yer might 'ave gone with 'im all the sime.'</p> 
<p>'Na. You're goin' with 'Arry, ain't yer?'</p> 
<p>'Yus!'</p> 
<p>'An' you're goin' to 'ave 'im?'</p> 
<p>'Right again!'</p> 
<p>'Well, I couldn't go with Tom, and then throw him over.'</p> 
<p>'Well, you are a mug!'</p> 
<p>The two girls had strolled down towards the Westminster Bridge Road, and Sally, meeting her young man, had gone to him. Liza walked back, wishing to get home in time to cook the dinner. But she went slowly, for she knew every dweller in the street, and as she passed the groups sitting at their doors, as on the previous evening, but this time mostly engaged in peeling potatoes or shelling peas, she stopped and had a little chat. Everyone liked her, and was glad to have her company. 'Good old Liza,' they would say, as she left them, 'she's a rare good sort, ain't she?'</p> 
<p>She asked after the aches and pains of all the old people, and delicately inquired after the babies, past and future; the children hung on to her skirts and asked her to play with them, and she would hold one end of the rope while tiny little ragged girls skipped, invariably entangling themselves after two jumps.</p> 
<p>She had nearly reached home, when she heard a voice cry:</p> 
<p>'Mornin'!'</p> 
<p>She looked round and recognized the man whom Tom had told her was called Jim Blakeston. He was sitting on a stool at the door of one of the houses, playing with two young children, to whom he was giving rides on his knee. She remembered his heavy brown beard from the day before, and she had also an impression of great size; she noticed this morning that he was, in fact, a big man, tall and broad, and she saw besides that he had large, masculine features and pleasant brown eyes. She supposed him to be about forty.</p> 
<p>'Mornin'!' he said again, as she stopped and looked at him.</p> 
<p>'Well, yer needn't look as if I was goin' ter eat yer up, 'cause I ain't,' he said.</p> 
<p>''Oo are you? I'm not afeard of yer.'</p> 
<p>'Wot are yer so bloomin' red abaht?' he asked pointedly.</p> 
<p>'Well, I'm 'ot.'</p> 
<p>'You ain't shirty 'cause I kissed yer last night?'</p> 
<p>'I'm not shirty; but it was pretty cool, considerin' like as I didn't know yer.'</p> 
<p>'Well, you run into my arms.'</p> 
<p>'Thet I didn't; you run aht and caught me.'</p> 
<p>'An' kissed yer before you could say "Jack Robinson".' He laughed at the thought. 'Well, Liza,' he went on, 'seein' as 'ow I kissed yer against yer will, the best thing you can do ter make it up is to kiss me not against yer will.'</p> 
<p>'Me?' said Liza, looking at him, open-mouthed. 'Well you are a pill!'</p> 
<p>The children began to clamour for the riding, which had been discontinued on Liza's approach.</p> 
<p>'Are them your kids?' she asked.</p> 
<p>'Yus; them's two on 'em.'</p> 
<p>''Ow many 'ave yer got?'</p> 
<p>'Five; the eldest gal's fifteen, and the next one 'oo's a boy's twelve, and then there are these two and baby.'</p> 
<p>'Well, you've got enough for your money.'</p> 
<p>'Too many for me--and more comin'.'</p> 
<p>'Ah well,' said Liza, laughing, 'thet's your fault, ain't it?'</p> 
<p>Then she bade him good morning, and strolled off.</p> 
<p>He watched her as she went, and saw half a dozen little boys surround her and beg her to join them in their game of cricket. They caught hold of her arms and skirts, and pulled her to their pitch.</p> 
<p>'No, I can't,' she said trying to disengage herself. 'I've got the dinner ter cook.'</p> 
<p>'Dinner ter cook?' shouted one small boy. 'Why, they always cooks the cats' meat at the shop.'</p> 
<p>'You little so-and-so!' said Liza, somewhat inelegantly, making a dash at him.</p> 
<p>He dodged her and gave a whoop; then turning he caught her round the legs, and another boy catching hold of her round the neck they dragged her down, and all three struggled on the ground, rolling over and over; the other boys threw themselves on the top, so that there was a great heap of legs and arms and heads waving and bobbing up and down.</p> 
<p>Liza extricated herself with some difficulty, and taking off her hat she began cuffing the boys with it, using all the time the most lively expressions. Then, having cleared the field, she retired victorious into her own house and began cooking the dinner.</p> 
<p>第二天是星期日。丽莎早晨起来穿衣服的时候，想到一样东西不可能“吃下肚里，还在手里”，深深懊悔自己不该把新衣裳穿了出去，从此再没有第一次穿着它去出风头的可能了。</p> 
<p>她叹息一声，穿上家常的工作衣服，着手准备早餐，因为她母亲昨夜去给街上新搬来的人家贺喜，回来睡晚了，今天早晨她的“风湿”又发了。</p> 
<p>“唷，我的头呀！”她双手按住两边的额角，正在叫苦。“我又神经痛发作了；怎么办呀？不知怎么搞的，总是在星期天早上发病。哦，还有我的风湿，一夜里简直要我命！”</p> 
<p>“你还是去医院看一看吧，妈妈。”</p> 
<p>“我才不去呢！”这位可敬的太太斩钉截铁地说，“你有一群小伙子跟你混在一起，看着你，叫你不要喝啤酒，不要喝白酒。而我呢，我说呀，我说我没有我这杯啤酒就活不下去。”她猛力拍打枕头，加强她的语气。</p> 
<p>“我有那么些事情要做，既要照顾你，烧饭弄菜，把样样都弄舒齐，做不完的家务，还要出去打杂——所以我说呀，要不是靠一点啤酒支撑着，我早埋在地里了。”</p> 
<p>她啃着黄油面包，喝她的茶。</p> 
<p>“丽莎，”她说，“你吃好了早饭，把门窗的格栅揩揩干净，再把我的皮鞋稍微擦一下。隔壁泰克太太会给你些鞋油的。”</p> 
<p>她沉默了一会儿，接着又说——</p> 
<p>“我看今天我起不来了，丽莎。我风湿发作。你把房间收拾收拾，把饭烧好了。”</p> 
<p>“好，妈妈；你就什么都不要动，都由我来。”</p> 
<p>“好吧，这也是你应该做的，你要想想你小时候添了我多少麻烦，想想我生你的时候，医生总以为我绝对没命了。丽莎，你这个星期的工钱怎么样了？”</p> 
<p>“哦，我放起来了．”丽莎轻声回答。</p> 
<p>“放在哪儿！”她母亲问。</p> 
<p>“放在安全的地方！”</p> 
<p>丽莎被迫逼得走投无路。</p> 
<p>“你要知道它干吗？”她问。</p> 
<p>“为什么我不该知道，难道你以为我要偷你的吗？”</p> 
<p>“不，不是那个。”</p> 
<p>“那么，你干吗不告诉我？”</p> 
<p>“哦，东西放在哪里，只有一个人知道，比较安全。”</p> 
<p>她这句话说得很谨慎，不料引起肯普太太大发雷霆：她竖起身子，坐在床上向她女儿挥舞着拳头。</p> 
<p>“我懂你的意思——你这——你！”她的语言很有力，形容词也用得绘声绘色，只是太生动有力，未便转述。“你以为我会偷你的，”她继续说。“我知道你！你以为我会拿你的肮脏钱吗？”</p> 
<p>“不过，妈，”丽莎说，“以前我告诉了你，钱就好象走气了。’’</p> 
<p>“你这是什么意思？”</p> 
<p>“钱少了。”</p> 
<p>“呀，这我可没有办法，我能怎么样？任何人都可能跑进这屋里来拿了去的。’’</p> 
<p>“要是藏得好好的，他们就拿不到了，是不是，妈妈？”丽莎说。</p> 
<p>肯普太太挥着拳头说一</p> 
<p>“你这下贱的臭货，你，你以为我会拿你的钱！我为了养活你，把骨头都磨断了，你应该把每个星期的工钱交给我，不应该积起来，尽去买乱七八糟的东西。”</p> 
<p>“你要知道，妈妈，假如我不积一点起来，到你倒霉的时候，我们就尴尬了。”</p> 
<p>肯普太太的钱总是到星期二就用完了，于是到星期六为止这个家就得由丽莎维持。</p> 
<p>“哦，别跟我说！”肯普太太继续说。“我是年轻姑娘的时候，我把钱都交给我妈。她从来没有向我要过。每逢星期六我拿了工钱，一分一厘都给她。做女儿的应该这样嘛。我可以自己说一句，我对我母亲尽了做女儿的本分。别用浪子回头这一套来教训我！我的妈从来不必开口向我要三个铜板去买口啤酒喝的。”</p> 
<p>丽莎是她这一辈里一个聪明的姑娘；她一声不响，戴上了帽子。</p> 
<p>“哼，你准备出去，把我丢下；我不知道你跟这些男人在街上搞些什么名堂。没有好处，我可以肯定。你把我一个人丢在这里，孤单单的，我死，你也不管。”</p> 
<p>老太太伤心得哭泣起来，而丽莎一溜烟从屋子里到了街上。</p> 
<p>对面房子的墙脚跟前，汤姆靠在那儿；他向她走来。</p> 
<p>“嗨！”她看见了他，招呼他。“你在这儿作啥？”</p> 
<p>“我在等你出来，丽莎，”他回答。</p> 
<p>她向他瞥了一眼。</p> 
<p>“你要是那个意思，那我说我今天不跟你出去，”她说。</p> 
<p>“我没再想要求你跟我出去，丽莎——既然你昨天夜里对我说了那些话。”</p> 
<p>他的声音有些发颤，她很为他难过。</p> 
<p>“不过，你总有什么话要对我说，是不是，汤姆？”她说，口气比刚才温和。</p> 
<p>“你不是明天有一天休假吗？”</p> 
<p>“公假日注。是啊！怎么样？”</p> 
<p>“嗯，因为他们有辆四轮大马车，从红狮酒店出发，明天到庆福注去一天——我准备去。”</p> 
<p>“是吗！”她说。</p> 
<p>他用疑惑的眼光凝视着她。</p> 
<p>“你也去吗，丽莎？是个普通的郊游聚餐会，去的都是这里街上的人。怎么样，丽莎？”</p> 
<p>“不，我不能去。”</p> 
<p>“为什么不能去？”</p> 
<p>“我没有——我没有钱。”</p> 
<p>“我是想问，你跟我去，好吗？”</p> 
<p>“不，汤姆，谢谢你；这我也不行。”</p> 
<p>“你完全可以去嘛，丽莎，对你不会有什么不好。”</p> 
<p>“不，这不大好，我不能跟你去了却又对你没有意思！这变成我骗你白白请我出去玩一次啦。”</p> 
<p>“我不懂为什么，’’他垂头丧气地说。</p> 
<p>“昨天夜里我跟你说了那些之后，我不能再跟你在一起。”</p> 
<p>“没有你一起去，我还有什么味儿，丽莎。”</p> 
<p>“你可以另外找个别人，汤姆。你完全可以不一定要我。”</p> 
<p>她对他点了点头，朝街上她的女伴萨莉家走去了。到了门前，她把双手做了个喇叭形状，大声叫道——</p> 
<p>“嗨！嗨！嗨！萨莉！”</p> 
<p>两个站在旁边的男人学着她叫。</p> 
<p>“嗨！嗨！嗨！萨莉！”</p> 
<p>“去！”丽莎说，回头看看他们。</p> 
<p>萨莉没应，她继续叫喊，这两个男人模仿她，另外五、六个跟了上来，于是声音响得足以唤醒沉睡的七隐士注。</p> 
<p>“嗨！嗨！嗨！萨莉！”</p> 
<p>一个头从上面顶层的窗口探出来，丽莎脱下帽子，挥着向她招呼，大声叫喊一</p> 
<p>“下来，萨莉！”</p> 
<p>“好，老朋友！”对方也叫。“我就来了！”</p> 
<p>“圣诞节也就来了，”丽莎给她个机智的回复。</p> 
<p>楼梯上一阵啪嗒啪嗒的声音，萨莉直奔下来，投入丽莎的怀抱。她们回想起最近一起看的一出传奇剧，学着开起玩笑来。</p> 
<p>“哦，我的心肝宝贝！”丽莎一边说，一边亲吻她，装出欣喜若狂的样子，把她紧紧抱住。</p> 
<p>“我最亲爱的亲爱的！”萨莉也装腔作势，这样对答。</p> 
<p>“小姐今天好？”</p> 
<p>“噢！”——嗲声嗲气，有气无力地——“好极；公主您好？”</p> 
<p>“非常遗憾，”丽莎回答，“可是我这个公主肚子里尽在咕噜噜叫。”</p> 
<p>萨莉是个瘦小的姑娘，灰黄的头发，蓝色的眼睛，满脸雀斑。她的嘴特别大，稀开的阔板牙齿，仿佛铁棒也能嚼，样子很难看。她穿得跟丽莎差不多，一条稍短的黑裙子，一件已经旧得说不出是绿、是灰、还是黄的老式紧身上衣，袖子卷到了臂肘弯，外面罩着一条原来是白的、现在脏得一塌糊涂的围裙。</p> 
<p>“你的头发卷着这些东西干吗？”丽莎指着萨莉头上的卷发纸，问道。“今天你要跟男朋友出去吗？”</p> 
<p>“不，我今天整天不出去。”</p> 
<p>“那你为什么卷头发？”</p> 
<p>“是这样，明天哈利要带我到庆福去。”</p> 
<p>“噢？乘红狮酒店的四轮大马车去吗？”</p> 
<p>“是啊。你去吗？”</p> 
<p>“不去！”</p> 
<p>“不去！咦，你为什么不叫汤姆带你去？他会带你去，他也正高兴哩。”</p> 
<p>“他叫我跟他去，可我不去。”</p> 
<p>“天晓得——为什么不跟他去呢？’’</p> 
<p>“我不跟他做朋友了。”</p> 
<p>“可你还是可以跟他一起去嘛。”</p> 
<p>“不。你跟哈利一起去吗？”</p> 
<p>“对！”</p> 
<p>“你准备要他吗？”</p> 
<p>“又说对了！”</p> 
<p>“可我不能跟汤姆一起去了之后又把他丢了。"</p> 
<p>“啊呀！你真是个傻瓜！”</p> 
<p>两个姑娘朝着威斯敏斯特桥大道踱过去，萨莉碰到了她的男朋友，向他走去了。</p> 
<p>丽莎回头走，要赶回家做饭。但是她走不快，因为她认识小街上的每一个居民，一路上碰到象昨天黄昏时候一样坐在门口的那一堆堆人，——这会儿大多数在削土豆或者剥豆壳——她总站停下来，跟她们攀谈几句。人人都喜欢她，喜欢跟她在一起。</p> 
<p>“好姑娘丽莎，”她们在她走过去后说，“她真是个难得的好姑娘呀！”</p> 
<p>她询问所有老年人的病痛，亲切关怀刚出生的和还没出生的婴儿们的情况；孩子们绕在她裙脚跟前，要她跟他们一起玩；破破烂烂的女小孩儿们跳绳，跳不上两、三下就绊住了，她常握着绳子的一端，帮她们挥绳。</p> 
<p>她快到家门口的时候，听见有人在招呼一</p> 
<p>“早上好！”</p> 
<p>她回头一看，原来就是汤姆告诉她名字的吉姆·布莱克斯顿。他坐在一所房子门口的一张凳子上，有两个很小的孩子骑在他膝盖上玩。</p> 
<p>她从昨天起脑海里一直浮现着他那浓密的棕色胡子和一个高大的形象。今天早晨她看清了，他确实是个大个子，又高又阔，此外她还看到，他有粗犷的男性的面貌，棕色的眼睛神采奕奕。</p> 
<p>她猜他大概四十岁左右。</p> 
<p>“早上好！”她停下来瞧着他的时候，他重复招呼了一声。</p> 
<p>丽莎脸涨得通红，慌张得回不出话。</p> 
<p>“怎么，你不用害怕得好象我会吃掉你，你放心，我不会的”，他说。</p> 
<p>“你算什么？我不怕你。”</p> 
<p>“那你为什么脸涨得那么红呢？”他一针见血地问。</p> 
<p>“嗯，我热嘛。”</p> 
<p>“昨天夜里我吻了你，你不恼火吗？”</p> 
<p>“我不恼火；不过我和你素不相识，你真是岂有此理。’’</p> 
<p>“咦，是你冲进我怀里来的。”</p> 
<p>“我没有，是你冲出来把我抓住的。”</p> 
<p>“而且我趁你惊慌失措，吻了你。”他想到这情景，哈哈大笑。</p> 
<p>“好吧，丽莎，”他接着说，“既然我勉强了你，吻了你，那么你最好的补救办法就是不勉强自己地吻还我。”</p> 
<p>“我吻你？”丽莎说，张开着嘴盯着他。“哼，你这个坏蛋！”</p> 
<p>两个孩子又吵着要在膝盖上骑马，刚才因为丽莎来了，才停下来的。</p> 
<p>“他们是你的孩子吗？”她问。</p> 
<p>“是的，他们是其中两个。”</p> 
<p>“你一共有几个？”</p> 
<p>“五个；最大的是女的，十五岁，下面一个是男的．f．：岁，再下面就是这两个和一个刚生下的娃娃。”</p> 
<p>“哦，这么些孩子开支够大的了。”</p> 
<p>“已经多得我受不了一一可是还要生出来呢。’’</p> 
<p>“唷，这是你的不是，对吗？”丽莎说着笑了起来。</p> 
<p>然后她对他道了早安，漫步走去了。</p> 
<p>他瞧着她慢慢走去，看她被五六个小孩子围着，要她和他们一起打板球。他们抓住她的手臂和裙子，把她拖到他们球门口。</p> 
<p>“不，我不能玩．”她说，一边拚命挣脱。“我要去烧饭。”</p> 
<p>“去烧饭？”一个很小的孩子嚷道。“哦，饭馆里总是烧猫肉的。”</p> 
<p>“你这个小东西！”丽莎说，不太文雅地向他冲上去。</p> 
<p>他避得快，对着她呐喊挑战；一个转身，他把她两条腿抱住了，另一个孩子上去攀住她的脖子，他们把她拖倒在地上，三个人在地上扭成一团，滚来滚去；其余几个孩子又扑到他们上面，于是只见一大堆的腿：臂膀、头在乱挥乱动，有如波涛起伏，浪花飞溅。</p> 
<p>丽莎好容易挣脱了出来，脱下帽子，挥击他们，嘴里尽说着最生动的骂人的语言。终于她击退了他们，胜利归家，开始做饭。</p>
