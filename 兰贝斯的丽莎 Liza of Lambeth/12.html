Her mother had evidently roused herself, for she was lying in bed by her side, partially undressed, with all the bedclothes rolled round her. Liza shivered in the cold night, and taking off some of her things--her boots, her skirt, and jacket--got right into bed; she tried to get some of the blanket from her mother, but as she pulled Mrs. Kemp gave a growl in her sleep and drew the clothes more tightly round her. So Liza put over herself her skirt and a shawl, which was lying over the end of the bed, and tried to go to sleep.</p> 
<p>But she could not; her head and hands were broiling hot, and she was terribly thirsty; when she lifted herself up to get a drink of water such a pang went through her head that she fell back on the bed groaning, and lay there with beating heart. And strange pains that she did not know went through her. Then a cold shiver seemed to rise in the very marrow of her bones and run down every artery and vein, freezing the blood; her skin puckered up, and drawing up her legs she lay huddled together in a heap, the shawl wrapped tightly round her, and her teeth chattering. Shivering, she whispered:</p> 
<p>'Oh, I'm so cold, so cold. Mother, give me some clothes; I shall die of the cold. Oh, I'm freezing!'</p> 
<p>But after awhile the cold seemed to give way, and a sudden heat seized her, flushing her face, making her break out into perspiration, so that she threw everything off and loosened the things about her neck.</p> 
<p>'Give us a drink,' she said. 'Oh, I'd give anythin' for a little drop of water!'</p> 
<p>There was no one to hear; Mrs. Kemp continued to sleep heavily, occasionally breaking out into a little snore.</p> 
<p>Liza remained there, now shivering with cold, now panting for breath, listening to the regular, heavy breathing by her side, and in her pain she sobbed. She pulled at her pillow and said:</p> 
<p>'Why can't I go to sleep? Why can't I sleep like 'er?'</p> 
<p>And the darkness was awful; it was a heavy, ghastly blackness, that seemed palpable, so that it frightened her and she looked for relief at the faint light glimmering through the window from a distant street-lamp. She thought the night would never end--the minutes seemed like hours, and she wondered how she should live through till morning. And strange pains that she did not know went through her.</p> 
<p>Still the night went on, the darkness continued, cold and horrible, and her mother breathed loudly and steadily by her side.</p> 
<p>At last with the morning sleep came; but the sleep was almost worse than the wakefulness, for it was accompanied by ugly, disturbing dreams. Liza thought she was going through the fight with her enemy, and Mrs. Blakeston grew enormous in size, and multiplied, so that every way she turned the figure confronted her. And she began running away, and she ran and ran till she found herself reckoning up an account she had puzzled over in the morning, and she did it backwards and forwards, upwards and downwards, starting here, starting there, and the figures got mixed up with other things, and she had to begin over again, and everything jumbled up, and her head whirled, till finally, with a start, she woke.</p> 
<p>The darkness had given way to a cold, grey dawn, her uncovered legs were chilled to the bone, and by her side she heard again the regular, nasal breathing of the drunkard.</p> 
<p>For a long while she lay where she was, feeling very sick and ill, but better than in the night. At last her mother woke.</p> 
<p>'Liza!' she called.</p> 
<p>'Yus, mother,' she answered feebly.</p> 
<p>'Git us a cup of tea, will yer?'</p> 
<p>'I can't, mother, I'm ill.'</p> 
<p>'Garn!' said Mrs. Kemp, in surprise. Then looking at her: 'Swop me bob, wot's up with yer? Why, yer cheeks is flushed, an' yer forehead--it is 'ot! Wot's the matter with yer, gal?'</p> 
<p>'I dunno,' said Liza. 'I've been thet bad all night, I thought I was goin' ter die.'</p> 
<p>'I know wot it is,' said Mrs. Kemp, shaking her head; 'the fact is, you ain't used ter drinkin', an' of course it's upset yer. Now me, why I'm as fresh as a disy. Tike my word, there ain't no good in teetotalism; it finds yer aht in the end, an' it's found you aht.'</p> 
<p>Mrs. Kemp considered it a judgment of Providence. She got up and mixed some whisky and water.</p> 
<p>''Ere, drink this,' she said. 'When one's 'ad a drop too much at night, there's nothin' like havin' a drop more in the mornin' ter put one right. It just acts like magic.'</p> 
<p>'Tike it awy,' said Liza, turning from it in disgust; 'the smell of it gives me the sick. I'll never touch spirits again.'</p> 
<p>'Ah, thet's wot we all says sometime in our lives, but we does, an' wot's more we can't do withaht it. Why, me, the 'ard life I've 'ad--.' It is unnecessary to repeat Mrs. Kemp's repetitions.</p> 
<p>Liza did not get up all day. Tom came to inquire after her, and was told she was very ill. Liza plaintively asked whether anyone else had been, and sighed a little when her mother answered no. But she felt too ill to think much or trouble much about anything. The fever came again as the day wore on, and the pains in her head grew worse. Her mother came to bed, and quickly went off to sleep, leaving Liza to bear her agony alone. She began to have frightful pains all over her, and she held her breath to prevent herself from crying out and waking her mother. She clutched the sheets in her agony, and at last, about six o'clock in the morning, she could bear it no longer, and in the anguish of labour screamed out, and woke her mother.</p> 
<p>Mrs. Kemp was frightened out of her wits. Going upstairs she woke the woman who lived on the floor above her. Without hesitating, the good lady put on a skirt and came down.</p> 
<p>'She's 'ad a miss,' she said, after looking at Liza. 'Is there anyone you could send to the 'orspital?'</p> 
<p>'Na, I dunno 'oo I could get at this hour?'</p> 
<p>'Well, I'll git my old man ter go.'</p> 
<p>She called her husband, and sent him off. She was a stout, middle-aged woman, rough-visaged and strong-armed. Her name was Mrs. Hodges.</p> 
<p>'It's lucky you came ter me,' she said, when she had settled down. 'I go aht nursin', yer know, so I know all abaht it.'</p> 
<p>'Well, you surprise me,' said Mrs. Kemp. 'I didn't know as Liza was thet way. She never told me nothin' abaht it.'</p> 
<p>'D'yer know 'oo it is 'as done it?'</p> 
<p>'Now you ask me somethin' I don't know,' replied Mrs. Kemp. 'But now I come ter think of it, it must be thet there Tom. 'E's been keepin' company with Liza. 'E's a single man, so they'll be able ter get married--thet's somethin'.'</p> 
<p>'It ain't Tom,' feebly said Liza.</p> 
<p>'Not 'im; 'oo is it, then?'</p> 
<p>Liza did not answer.</p> 
<p>'Eh?' repeated the mother, ''oo is it?'</p> 
<p>Liza lay still without speaking.</p> 
<p>'Never mind, Mrs. Kemp,' said Mrs. Hodges, 'don't worry 'er now; you'll be able ter find aht all abaht it when she gits better.'</p> 
<p>For a while the two women sat still, waiting the doctor's coming, and Liza lay gazing vacantly at the wall, panting for breath. Sometimes Jim crossed her mind, and she opened her mouth to call for him, but in her despair she restrained herself.</p> 
<p>The doctor came.</p> 
<p>'D'you think she's bad, doctor?' asked Mrs. Hodges.</p> 
<p>'I'm afraid she is rather,' he answered. 'I'll come in again this evening.'</p> 
<p>'Oh, doctor,' said Mrs. Kemp, as he was going, 'could yer give me somethin' for my rheumatics? I'm a martyr to rheumatism, an' these cold days I 'ardly knows wot ter do with myself. An', doctor, could you let me 'ave some beef-tea? My 'usbind's dead, an' of course I can't do no work with my daughter ill like this, an' we're very short--.'</p> 
<p>The day passed, and in the evening Mrs. Hodges, who had been attending to her own domestic duties, came downstairs again. Mrs. Kemp was on the bed sleeping.</p> 
<p>'I was just 'avin' a little nap,' she said to Mrs. Hodges, on waking.</p> 
<p>''Ow is the girl?' asked that lady.</p> 
<p>'Oh,' answered Mrs. Kemp, 'my rheumatics 'as been thet bad I really 'aven't known wot ter do with myself, an' now Liza can't rub me I'm worse than ever. It is unfortunate thet she should get ill just now when I want so much attendin' ter myself, but there, it's just my luck!'</p> 
<p>Mrs. Hodges went over and looked at Liza; she was lying just as when she left in the morning, her cheeks flushed, her mouth open for breath, and tiny beads of sweat stood on her forehead.</p> 
<p>''Ow are yer, ducky?' asked Mrs. Hodges; but Liza did not answer.</p> 
<p>'It's my belief she's unconscious,' said Mrs. Kemp. 'I've been askin' 'er 'oo it was as done it, but she don't seem to 'ear wot I say. It's been a great shock ter me, Mrs. 'Odges.'</p> 
<p>'I believe you,' replied that lady, sympathetically.</p> 
<p>'Well, when you come in and said wot it was, yer might 'ave knocked me dahn with a feather. I knew no more than the dead wot 'ad 'appened.'</p> 
<p>'I saw at once wot it was,' said Mrs. Hodges, nodding her head.</p> 
<p>'Yus, of course, you knew. I expect you've 'ad a great deal of practice one way an' another.'</p> 
<p>'You're right, Mrs. Kemp, you're right. I've been on the job now for nearly twenty years, an' if I don't know somethin' abaht it I ought.'</p> 
<p>'D'yer finds it pays well?'</p> 
<p>'Well, Mrs. Kemp, tike it all in all, I ain't got no grounds for complaint. I'm in the 'abit of askin' five shillings, an' I will say this, I don't think it's too much for wot I do.'</p> 
<p>The news of Liza's illness had quickly spread, and more than once in the course of the day a neighbour had come to ask after her. There was a knock at the door now, and Mrs. Hodges opened it. Tom stood on the threshold asking to come in.</p> 
<p>'Yus, you can come,' said Mrs. Kemp.</p> 
<p>He advanced on tiptoe, so as to make no noise, and for a while stood silently looking at Liza. Mrs. Hodges was by his side.</p> 
<p>'Can I speak to 'er?' he whispered.</p> 
<p>'She can't 'ear you.'</p> 
<p>He groaned.</p> 
<p>'D'yer think she'll get arright?' he asked.</p> 
<p>Mrs. Hodges shrugged her shoulders.</p> 
<p>'I shouldn't like ter give an opinion,' she said, cautiously.</p> 
<p>Tom bent over Liza, and, blushing, kissed her; then, without speaking further, went out of the room.</p> 
<p>'Thet's the young man as was courtin' 'er,' said Mrs. Kemp, pointing over her shoulder with her thumb.</p> 
<p>Soon after the Doctor came.</p> 
<p>'Wot do yer think of 'er, doctor?' said Mrs. Hodges, bustling forwards authoritatively in her position of midwife and sick-nurse.</p> 
<p>'I'm afraid she's very bad.'</p> 
<p>'D'yer think she's goin' ter die?' she asked, dropping her voice to a whisper.</p> 
<p>'I'm afraid so!'</p> 
<p>As the doctor sat down by Liza's side Mrs. Hodges turned round and significantly nodded to Mrs. Kemp, who put her handkerchief to her eyes. Then she went outside to the little group waiting at the door.</p> 
<p>'Wot does the doctor sy?' they asked, among them Tom.</p> 
<p>''E says just wot I've been sayin' all along; I knew she wouldn't live.'</p> 
<p>And Tom burst out: 'Oh, Liza!'</p> 
<p>As she retired a woman remarked:</p> 
<p>'Mrs. 'Odges is very clever, I think.'</p> 
<p>'Yus,' remarked another, 'she got me through my last confinement simply wonderful. If it come to choosin' between 'em I'd back Mrs. 'Odges against forty doctors.'</p> 
<p>'Ter tell yer the truth, so would I. I've never known 'er wrong yet.'</p> 
<p>Mrs. Hodges sat down beside Mrs. Kemp and proceeded to comfort her.</p> 
<p>'Why don't yer tike a little drop of brandy ter calm yer nerves, Mrs. Kemp?' she said, 'you want it.'</p> 
<p>'I was just feelin' rather faint, an' I couldn't 'elp thinkin' as 'ow twopenneth of whisky 'ud do me good.'</p> 
<p>'Na, Mrs. Kemp,' said Mrs. Hodges, earnestly, putting her hand on the other's arm. 'You tike my tip--when you're queer there's nothin' like brandy for pullin' yer togither. I don't object to whisky myself, but as a medicine yer can't beat brandy.'</p> 
<p>'Well, I won't set up myself as knowin' better than you Mrs. 'Odges; I'll do wot you think right.'</p> 
<p>Quite accidentally there was some in the room, and Mrs. Kemp poured it out for herself and her friend.</p> 
<p>'I'm not in the 'abit of tikin' anythin' when I'm aht on business,' she apologized, 'but just ter keep you company I don't mind if I do.'</p> 
<p>'Your 'ealth. Mrs. 'Odges.'</p> 
<p>'Sime ter you, an' thank yer, Mrs. Kemp.'</p> 
<p>Liza lay still, breathing very quietly, her eyes closed. The doctor kept his fingers on her pulse.</p> 
<p>'I've been very unfortunate of lite,' remarked Mrs. Hodges, as she licked her lips, 'this mikes the second death I've 'ad in the last ten days--women, I mean, of course I don't count bibies.'</p> 
<p>'Yer don't sy so.'</p> 
<p>'Of course the other one--well, she was only a prostitute, so it didn't so much matter. It ain't like another woman is it?'</p> 
<p>'Na, you're right.'</p> 
<p>'Still, one don't like 'em ter die, even if they are thet. One mustn't be too 'ard on 'em.'</p> 
<p>'Strikes me you've got a very kind 'eart, Mrs. 'Odges,' said Mrs. Kemp.</p> 
<p>'I 'ave thet; an' I often says it 'ud be better for my peace of mind an' my business if I 'adn't. I 'ave ter go through a lot, I do; but I can say this for myself, I always gives satisfaction, an' thet's somethin' as all lidies in my line can't say.'</p> 
<p>They sipped their brandy for a while.</p> 
<p>'It's a great trial ter me that this should 'ave 'appened,' said Mrs. Kemp, coming to the subject that had been disturbing her for some time. 'Mine's always been a very respectable family, an' such a thing as this 'as never 'appened before. No, Mrs. 'Odges, I was lawfully married in church, an' I've got my marriage lines now ter show I was, an' thet one of my daughters should 'ave gone wrong in this way--well, I can't understand it. I give 'er a good education, an' she 'ad all the comforts of a 'ome. She never wanted for nothin'; I worked myself to the bone ter keep 'er in luxury, an' then thet she should go an' disgrace me like this!'</p> 
<p>'I understand wot yer mean. Mrs. Kemp.'</p> 
<p>'I can tell you my family was very respectable; an' my 'usband, 'e earned twenty-five shillings a week, an' was in the sime plice seventeen years; an' 'is employers sent a beautiful wreath ter put on 'is coffin; an' they tell me they never 'ad such a good workman an' sich an 'onest man before. An' me! Well, I can sy this--I've done my duty by the girl, an' she's never learnt anythin' but good from me. Of course I ain't always been in wot yer might call flourishing circumstances, but I've always set her a good example, as she could tell yer so 'erself if she wasn't speechless.'</p> 
<p>Mrs. Kemp paused for a moment's reflection.</p> 
<p>'As they sy in the Bible,' she finished, 'it's enough ter mike one's grey 'airs go dahn into the ground in sorrer. I can show yer my marriage certificate. Of course one doesn't like ter say much, because of course she's very bad; but if she got well I should 'ave given 'er a talkin' ter.'</p> 
<p>There was another knock.</p> 
<p>'Do go an' see 'oo thet is; I can't, on account of my rheumatics.'</p> 
<p>Mrs. Hodges opened the door. It was Jim.</p> 
<p>He was very white, and the blackness of his hair and beard, contrasting with the deathly pallor of his face, made him look ghastly. Mrs. Hodges stepped back.</p> 
<p>''Oo's 'e?' she said, turning to Mrs. Kemp.</p> 
<p>Jim pushed her aside and went up to the bed.</p> 
<p>'Doctor, is she very bad?' he asked.</p> 
<p>The doctor looked at him questioningly.</p> 
<p>Jim whispered: 'It was me as done it. She ain't goin' ter die, is she?'</p> 
<p>The doctor nodded.</p> 
<p>'O God! wot shall I do? It was my fault! I wish I was dead!'</p> 
<p>Jim took the girl's head in his hands, and the tears burst from his eyes.</p> 
<p>'She ain't dead yet, is she?'</p> 
<p>'She's just living,' said the doctor.</p> 
<p>Jim bent down.</p> 
<p>'Liza, Liza, speak ter me! Liza, say you forgive me! Oh, speak ter me!'</p> 
<p>His voice was full of agony. The doctor spoke.</p> 
<p>'She can't hear you.'</p> 
<p>'Oh, she must hear me! Liza! Liza!'</p> 
<p>He sank on his knees by the bedside.</p> 
<p>They all remained silent: Liza lying stiller than ever, her breast unmoved by the feeble respiration, Jim looking at her very mournfully; the doctor grave, with his fingers on the pulse. The two women looked at Jim.</p> 
<p>'Fancy it bein' 'im!' said Mrs. Kemp. 'Strike me lucky, ain't 'e a sight!'</p> 
<p>'You 'ave got 'er insured, Mrs. Kemp?' asked the midwife. She could bear the silence no longer.</p> 
<p>'Trust me fur thet!' replied the good lady. 'I've 'ad 'er insured ever since she was born. Why, only the other dy I was sayin' ter myself thet all thet money 'ad been wisted, but you see it wasn't; yer never know yer luck, you see!'</p> 
<p>'Quite right, Mrs. Kemp; I'm a rare one for insurin'. It's a great thing. I've always insured all my children.'</p> 
<p>'The way I look on it is this,' said Mrs. Kemp--'wotever yer do when they're alive, an' we all know as children is very tryin' sometimes, you should give them a good funeral when they dies. Thet's my motto, an' I've always acted up to it.'</p> 
<p>'Do you deal with Mr. Stearman?' asked Mrs. Hodges.</p> 
<p>'No, Mrs. 'Odges, for undertikin' give me Mr. Footley every time. In the black line 'e's fust an' the rest nowhere!'</p> 
<p>'Well, thet's very strange now--thet's just wot I think. Mr. Footley does 'is work well, an' 'e's very reasonable. I'm a very old customer of 'is, an' 'e lets me 'ave things as cheap as anybody.'</p> 
<p>'Does 'e indeed! Well Mrs. 'Odges if it ain't askin' too much of yer, I should look upon it as very kind if you'd go an' mike the arrangements for Liza.'</p> 
<p>'Why, certainly, Mrs. Kemp. I'm always willin' ter do a good turn to anybody, if I can.'</p> 
<p>'I want it done very respectable,' said Mrs. Kemp; 'I'm not goin' ter stint for nothin' for my daughter's funeral. I like plumes, you know, although they is a bit extra.'</p> 
<p>'Never you fear, Mrs. Kemp, it shall be done as well as if it was for my own 'usbind, an' I can't say more than thet. Mr. Footley thinks a deal of me, 'e does! Why, only the other dy as I was goin' inter 'is shop 'e says "Good mornin', Mrs. 'Odges." "Good mornin', Mr. Footley," says I. "You've jest come in the nick of time," says 'e. "This gentleman an' myself," pointin' to another gentleman as was standin' there, "we was 'avin' a bit of an argument. Now you're a very intelligent woman, Mrs. 'Odges, and a good customer too." "I can say thet for myself," say I, "I gives yer all the work I can." "I believe you," says 'e. "Well," 'e says, "now which do you think? Does hoak look better than helm, or does helm look better than hoak? Hoak _versus_ helm, thet's the question." "Well, Mr. Footley," says I, "for my own private opinion, when you've got a nice brass plite in the middle, an' nice brass 'andles each end, there's nothin' like hoak." "Quite right," says 'e, "thet's wot I think; for coffins give me hoak any day, an' I 'ope," says 'e, "when the Lord sees fit ter call me to 'Imself, I shall be put in a hoak coffin myself." "Amen," says I.'</p> 
<p>'I like hoak,' said Mrs. Kemp. 'My poor 'usband 'e 'ad a hoak coffin. We did 'ave a job with 'im, I can tell yer. You know 'e 'ad dropsy, an' 'e swell up--oh, 'e did swell; 'is own mother wouldn't 'ave known 'im. Why, 'is leg swell up till it was as big round as 'is body, swop me bob, it did.'</p> 
<p>'Did it indeed!' ejaculated Mrs. Hodges.</p> 
<p>'Yus, an' when 'e died they sent the coffin up. I didn't 'ave Mr. Footley at thet time; we didn't live 'ere then, we lived in Battersea, an' all our undertikin' was done by Mr. Brownin'; well, 'e sent the coffin up, an' we got my old man in, but we couldn't get the lid down, he was so swell up. Well, Mr. Brownin', 'e was a great big man, thirteen stone if 'e was a ounce. Well, 'e stood on the coffin, an' a young man 'e 'ad with 'im stood on it too, an' the lid simply wouldn't go dahn; so Mr. Browning', 'e said, "Jump on, missus," so I was in my widow's weeds, yer know, but we 'ad ter git it dahn, so I stood on it, an' we all jumped, an' at last we got it to, an' screwed it; but, lor', we did 'ave a job; I shall never forget it.'</p> 
<p>Then all was silence. And a heaviness seemed to fill the air like a grey blight, cold and suffocating; and the heaviness was Death. They felt the presence in the room, and they dared not move, they dared not draw their breath. The silence was terrifying.</p> 
<p>Suddenly a sound was heard--a loud rattle. It was from the bed and rang through the room, piercing the stillness.</p> 
<p>The doctor opened one of Liza's eyes and touched it, then he laid on her breast the hand he had been holding, and drew the sheet over her head.</p> 
<p>Jim turned away with a look of intense weariness on his face, and the two women began weeping silently. The darkness was sinking before the day, and a dim, grey light came through the window. The lamp spluttered out.</p> 
<p>半夜光景丽莎醒来，嘴里又热又干，头稍一移动就是刀劈一般的一阵剧痛。</p> 
<p>她母亲当然也醒了，因为她和她同睡一张床，就在她身旁。她衣服也没有穿好，把被褥都裹在身上。</p> 
<p>丽莎在这寒冷的夜里瑟瑟发抖，她是脱捧了一部分衣裳——鞋子、裙子和外套——上床的。她想从她母亲那里把毯子拉过来些，可是她一拉，肯普太太就在睡梦中号叫，把被褥裹得更紧。所以丽莎把她搁在床背上的裙子和一条披巾拖来盖在身上，想能够睡去。</p> 
<p>但是她睡不着。她的头和手都沸烫，嘴里干得要命。她自己撑起来喝一口水的时候，头痛得倒下身子尽是哼哼地呻吟，躺在那儿心跳得厉害。一阵阵她从没有经受过的异样的疼痛侵袭着她。</p> 
<p>然后她骨髓中发出一阵寒冷的颤抖，直透入每根血管，仿佛使血液都凝冻了。她的皮肤皱了起来，她蜷起双腿，缩成一团，紧紧裹着披巾，牙齿格格地打战。她颤抖着用微弱的声音说——</p> 
<p>“噢，我好冷，好冷啊！妈，给我盖一点，我要冷死了。呵．我冻死了！”</p> 
<p>但是过了一阵这寒冷似乎过去了，接下来突然一阵火热，脸上烧得通红，一身大汗，热得她把盖着的东西全都掀掉，把头颈里裹着的也都松开。</p> 
<p>“我口渴呀，”她说。“噢，要我怎么都行，给我一点水啊！”</p> 
<p>没有人听到她。肯普太太又睡熟了，不时发出一声鼾声。</p> 
<p>丽莎躺在那儿，一忽儿冷得发抖，一忽儿喘不过气，耳朵边只听得身旁那均匀而粗重的呼吸。她在痛苦中呜咽。</p> 
<p>她用力拉拉枕头，说道一一</p> 
<p>“为什么我睡不着？为什么我不能象她那样睡着呢？”</p> 
<p>这里黑暗得可怕l这种黑暗沉重而阴森，似乎用手可以摸得到，她十分恐惧I全凭远处的路灯透过窗口照来微弱的光芒，使她稍微心宽一些。</p> 
<p>她觉得这黑夜将永无终止——每一分钟都象是一个小时，她不知将如何挨到天明。</p> 
<p>又是一阵她没有经受过的异样的疼痛。</p> 
<p>夜依然，黑暗依然，又冷又可怕I她母亲在她身旁大声而着实地打呼。</p> 
<p>终于随着早晨的来到，睡眠也来到了。但是这睡眠几乎比醒着更糟糕．因为它带来可憎可怕的噩梦。</p> 
<p>丽莎在梦中和她的敌人打架，布莱克斯顿太太越来越高大，而且一个化了几个，她转向哪一面都正对着她。她逃了，她奔着奔着，后来又算起一笔早上没算清的帐目来。她从前面加到后面，上面加到下面．这儿加起，那儿加起，这些数字总跟其他东西混在一起．她得从头再箅，越算越糊涂，她头脑打转，直到最后一声惊叫，醒来了。</p> 
<p>黑暗已经让位给一个寒冷、阴黯的黎明。她那两条一点没盖什么的腿冻得冷到骨髓里，她又听到她身旁那泥醉的妈妈均匀的鼻息。</p> 
<p>她就这样躺了好一段时间，觉得身体很不舒服，很难过，不过比夜里好些。</p> 
<p>她母亲终于醒了。</p> 
<p>“丽莎！”她叫道。</p> 
<p>“唉，妈妈，”她没力气地回答。</p> 
<p>“弄杯茶给我，好吗？”</p> 
<p>“我不能动，妈，我病着。”</p> 
<p>“噢！”肯普太太惊异地说。再朝她看看，“唷，你怎么啦？怎么，你面孔通红，额角上——烫得厉害！你怎么啦，我的女儿？”</p> 
<p>“我不知道，”丽莎说。“我整夜难过得不得了，总当要死了。”</p> 
<p>“我懂了，”肯普太太摇摇头说，“问题是你没喝惯酒，所以喝了一点自然吃不消了。瞧我，我这生龙活虎的样子。相信我的话，忌酒没有好处，这回就叫你看颜色啦，叫你看颜色。”</p> 
<p>肯普太太把这看作是上帝的惩罚。</p> 
<p>她站起身来，配了些冲水的威士忌。</p> 
<p>“喏，喝这个，”她说，“碰到夜里喝得太多了一点的时候，最好是第二天早上再喝一点醒醒酒。这有魔术般的效力。”</p> 
<p>“拿开，”丽莎说，厌恶地掉转头；“我闻到这气味就难过。我永世也不再碰烈酒。”</p> 
<p>“啊，我们一生中有时候都这么说，不过我们喝还是喝．而且非喝不可。啊呀，我这艰难辛苦的一生——”这里无需去重复肯普太太重复的话。</p> 
<p>丽莎整天没有起床。</p> 
<p>汤姆来看望她，知道她病得厉害。丽莎哀伤地问，有没有别人来看过她，她母亲对她说“没有”，她听了微微叹息。但是她感觉很难过，对任何事情都不想多费心思。</p> 
<p>到渐近夜晚的时候，寒热又上升了，她的头痛也更加厉害。她母亲上床来，很快就睡着了，由丽莎一个人去忍受苦难。</p> 
<p>直到清晨六点钟左右，她终究再也忍受不住了，一阵分娩的阵痛使她尖声急叫起来，惊醒了她母亲。</p> 
<p>肯普太太吓得不知所措。她赶上楼去，叫醒了住在她们楼上的那个女人。这位善良的老太太毫不犹豫，穿上一条裙子，就下楼来了。</p> 
<p>“她小产了，”她看了看丽莎说。“你能叫个人到医院去请医生吗？”</p> 
<p>“不，这个时候我找谁去呢？”．</p> 
<p>“好吧，我叫我老头儿去跑一趟。”</p> 
<p>她叫了她丈夫，差他去了。她是个结实的中年妇女，浓眉大眼，臂膀粗粗的。她叫霍奇斯太太。</p> 
<p>“幸亏你来找了我．”她坐定下来后说。“我在外面当看护，所以这些我都懂。”</p> 
<p>“不过，你使我大吃一惊，”肯普太太说，“我一点不知道她有身子了。她从没有对我讲起过。”</p> 
<p>“你可知道是谁跟她有了的？”</p> 
<p>“你问的问题我一无所知，’’肯普太太答道。“不过，我现在想想，一定是汤姆。他常和丽莎在一起。他是单身汉，所以他们可以结婚——倒还好。”</p> 
<p>“不是汤姆，’’丽莎微弱的声音说。</p> 
<p>“不是他，那么是谁呢？”</p> 
<p>丽莎不答话。</p> 
<p>“嗯？”她妈重复问，“是谁呢？”</p> 
<p>丽莎一动不动躺在那儿，不吭一声。</p> 
<p>“别管它，肯普太太，”霍奇斯太太说，“现在不要去烦扰她。等她好一点，你什么都会弄明白的。”</p> 
<p>这两个女人默默地坐着，等待医生到来。丽莎气喘吁吁地躺着，两只眼睛空望着墙上。有时候吉姆在她心头闪过，她张开嘴巴想要叫唤他，但在绝望之中又没有叫出声来。</p> 
<p>医生来了。</p> 
<p>“你看她情况严重吗，医生？”霍奇斯太太问。</p> 
<p>“恐怕很严重，”他回答。“我晚上再来。”</p> 
<p>“啊，医生，”他要走的时候，肯普太太对他说，“你能给我些治风湿的药吗？我的风湿要我的命，现在冷天，我简直不知怎么过。另外，医生，你能给我些牛肉汁吗？我丈夫死了，我女儿病成这样子，我当然没法出去干活，所以我们实在短缺——”</p> 
<p>白天过去了，晚上，霍奇斯太太忙了一天自己的家务，又下楼来了。肯普太太在床上睡着。</p> 
<p>“我正在稍微打个瞌睡，”她醒来对霍奇斯太太说。</p> 
<p>“你女儿怎么样？”那个太太问。</p> 
<p>“哦，”肯普太太回答，“我的风湿发得那么厉害，我痛得简直毫无办法，而现在丽莎又不能替我擦药，那就更糟。真不巧，正在我需要照顾自己的时候，她生病了。不过，这也是我自己运气不好！”</p> 
<p>霍奇斯太太走到丽莎跟前看看她。她就象早上离开她时候一样地躺着，两颊通红，嘴巴张着喘气，额头上尽是一颗颗小小的汗珠。</p> 
<p>“你怎么样，宝贝？”霍奇斯太太问，但是丽莎没有回答。</p> 
<p>“我看她没有知觉了，”肯普太太说。“我再三问她是谁跟她搞了的，可她似乎听不见我说的话。这件事对我的震动可大呀，霍奇斯太太。”</p> 
<p>“我相信你．”那个太太同情地说。</p> 
<p>“唉，当你来对我说这是怎么回事的时候，你只要拿根羽毛准能把我拨倒。我原来对这事情象死人一样，一无所知。’’</p> 
<p>“我一看就知道是这么回事了，”霍奇斯太太点点头说。</p> 
<p>“是呀，你当然懂得。我想你在这方面有丰富的工作经验。”</p> 
<p>“你说得对，肯普太太，你说得对。我做这工作，到现在快有二十年了，不懂也该懂了。”</p> 
<p>“你觉得这行当收入不错吧？”</p> 
<p>“嗯，肯普太太，总的说来，我觉得还可以。我一般是收费五先令．我该说，我做的工作，要这一点不算太多。”</p> 
<p>丽莎害病的消息很快传布开去了，于是一天里面邻人来看望她的不止一个、两个。</p> 
<p>此刻有人敲门，霍奇斯太太去开了门。</p> 
<p>汤姆站在门口，要求进来。</p> 
<p>“好，你进来，”肯普太太说。</p> 
<p>他蹑手蹑脚地走过来，默默站在那儿望着丽莎。霍奇斯太太在他旁边。</p> 
<p>“我可以对她说话吗？”他轻声说。</p> 
<p>“她听不见你。”</p> 
<p>他叹息了一声。</p> 
<p>“你看她会好吗？”他问。</p> 
<p>霍奇斯太太耸耸肩膀。</p> 
<p>“我不敢说．”她谨慎地说。</p> 
<p>汤姆俯下身子，涨红了脸，吻了她一下,然后没再说一句话，就离开了这屋子。</p> 
<p>“那就是追求她的那个小伙子，”肯普太太说，用大拇指指着背后离去的汤姆。</p> 
<p>不多一刻，医生来了。</p> 
<p>“你看她怎么样，医生？”霍奇斯太太以催生婆和看护的身份神气十足地匆忙上前，问他。</p> 
<p>“恐怕情况很不好。”</p> 
<p>“你看她会死吗？”她压低声音在他耳朵边问。</p> 
<p>“靠不住！”</p> 
<p>医生在丽莎旁边坐下的时候，霍奇斯太太转身对肯普太太有所暗示地点点头，肯普太太用手帕擦眼睛。</p> 
<p>然后霍奇斯太太走出屋子，来到在门口等待着的一些人跟前。</p> 
<p>“医生怎么说？”他们问，其中有汤姆。</p> 
<p>“他说的就是我早就说的，我早知道她活不成了。”</p> 
<p>汤姆突然放声大叫，“啊，丽莎！”</p> 
<p>霍奇斯太太回进屋里，有个女人评论说——</p> 
<p>“我认为霍奇斯太太实在聪明。”</p> 
<p>“是啊，”另一个女人评论说，“上一回她给我催生，简直高明极了。如果要我作选择的话，我宁可要霍奇斯太太，而不要四十个医生。”</p> 
<p>“老实说，我也宁可要她。我从来没有听到她出过毛病。”</p> 
<p>霍奇斯太太在肯普太太旁边坐下，开始安慰她。</p> 
<p>“你为什么不喝一点白兰地镇定镇定神经呢，肯普太太？”她说：“你需要喝一点。”</p> 
<p>“我真有点要昏过去了，不禁想喝两便士威士忌提提神。”</p> 
<p>“不，肯普太太，”霍奇斯太太把手按在这个太太的臂膀上，认真地说。“你听我的话——你觉得不舒服的时候，白兰地最能使你振作起来。我自己并不反对威士忌，不过当药吃的话，却远不如白兰地。”</p> 
<p>“我不会以为自己比你在行，霍奇斯太太；你认为怎样对，我都照着做。’’</p> 
<p>碰巧家里有点白兰地，肯普太太就倒出来给她自己和她的朋友喝。</p> 
<p>“我出外工作的时候，是习惯不喝酒的，”她表示抱歉，“不过，为了陪陪你，喝一口也可以。”</p> 
<p>“祝你健康，霍奇斯太太。‘‘</p> 
<p>“你也健康，谢谢你，肯普太太。”</p> 
<p>丽莎一动不动地躺着，呼吸很微弱，眼睛闭着。医生一直把指头按在她脉搏上。</p> 
<p>“我最近运气非常不好，’’霍奇斯太太舔舔嘴唇说，“这是我这十天里碰到的第二个要死的人——我是指女人；当然婴孩不算在内。”</p> 
<p>“是吗？”</p> 
<p>“还有一个死掉的——不过，那是个妓女，所以无所谓。这同其他女人不一样，是不是？”</p> 
<p>“不一样，你说得对。’’</p> 
<p>“然而我们总不希望她们死掉，即使是妓女。我们决不能对她们太冷酷。”</p> 
<p>“我发现你良心真好，霍奇斯太太，’’肯普太太说。</p> 
<p>“我的心是好；我常说，我要是没有这颗良心，还好心安理得地多做点生意哩。我什么都得承担，的确，但是我可以自己夸口说一句，我总干得叫人满意，这可不是干我们这一行的人都能说得的。”</p> 
<p>她们喝了一会白兰地。</p> 
<p>“这种事情会发生，真是对我沉重的折磨，”肯普太太说，话头讲到了她困恼已久的问题上。</p> 
<p>“我们家一向很体面的，从没有出过这种事。不，霍奇斯太太，我是在教堂里合法地结婚的，我现在还拿得出结婚证书来给你看，而在我的女儿中间会有一个出这样的毛病——唉，我没法理解。我给她受过好好的教育，她又有一切家庭的安乐。她什么也不缺少。我做死做活给她吃得好，穿得好，而她竟做出这样丢人的事来！”</p> 
<p>“我懂得你的意思，肯普太太。”</p> 
<p>“我可以告诉你，我的家庭是很体面的；我丈夫，他一星期挣二十五先令，而且在同一个地方做了十七年；他的老板还在他棺材上安上了一个漂亮的花圈；他们对我说，他们从来不曾有过象他这样好的工人、这样老实的人。</p> 
<p>“而我呢！唉，我可以这样说——我对这个姑娘是尽到了我的责任，我从没有教坏她什么。当然我的境况并不一直是你们所说的那样兴旺，可是我始终给她做出好榜样。要不是她现在不会开口，你可以自己问她。”</p> 
<p>肯普太太停顿下来，思考了一会儿。</p> 
<p>“《圣经》上说的，”她末了说，“带着灰白的头发含悲埋在地下是足够的了。注 我现在还可以拿出结婚证书给你看。当然她病很重，我不能多说什么，然而如果她好了的话．我要好好训她一顿。”</p> 
<p>又有人敲门。</p> 
<p>“去看看是谁I我不能动，由于我的风湿。”</p> 
<p>霍奇斯太太去开了门。来的是吉姆。</p> 
<p>他脸色惨白异常，他的漆黑的头发和胡子和他死人般苍白的脸，相映之下显得阴森可怕。霍奇斯太太后退了一步。</p> 
<p>“他是谁？”她转身问肯普太太。</p> 
<p>吉姆把她推开，直走到床前。</p> 
<p>“医生，她很不好吗？”他问。</p> 
<p>医生疑惑地朝他看看。</p> 
<p>吉姆低声说，“是我跟她有了的。她不会死吧，会不会死?"</p> 
<p>医生点点头。</p> 
<p>“啊，上帝！教我怎么办？这是我的罪过！我但愿一死！’’</p> 
<p>吉姆双手捧住姑娘的头，眼泪直淌下来。</p> 
<p>“她还没有死吧？”</p> 
<p>“她还有口气，”医生说。</p> 
<p>吉姆俯下身子。</p> 
<p>“丽莎，丽莎．对我说话呀！丽莎，你饶恕我！哦，对我说话呀！”</p> 
<p>他的声音十分凄惨。</p> 
<p>医生说——</p> 
<p>“她听不见你。”</p> 
<p>“哦．她一定得听见我！丽莎！丽莎！”</p> 
<p>他在她床前跪倒了下来。</p> 
<p>他们全都默不作声：丽莎更沉静地躺着，呼吸微弱得胸口也不动，吉姆悲痛万分地端详着她；医生沉重地把手指按在她脉搏上。那两个女人望着吉姆。</p> 
<p>“想不到是他！”肯普太太说。“我觉得也是运气，他多英俊！”</p> 
<p>“你给她保了险吗，肯普太太？’’那催生婆问。她再也受不了这沉默了。</p> 
<p>“这还用问我！”这位好太太说。“她一生下来，我就给她保好险了。是啊，前几天我还在想，这种钱都是白费的，可你瞧，并不白费；一个人的命运自己也不知道！”</p> 
<p>“对呀，肯普太太；我特别相信保险。保险是大好事。我给我所有的孩子都保上险。”</p> 
<p>“我是这样想的，”肯普太太说，“不管他们活着的时候你怎样对待他们——我们都知道，孩子有时候是非常讨厌的——但是他们死了，丧葬必须给他们好好办。这是我的格言，我一直都遵守的。”</p> 
<p>“你交托给史蒂曼先生办的吗？”霍奇斯太太问。</p> 
<p>“不，霍奇斯太太，丧葬的事我每次都找福特利先生。在这个行业中，他是首屈一指，别人都望尘莫及的！”</p> 
<p>“咦，这可真奇怪——你的想法和我正好完全一样。福特利先生生活做得好，收费又公道。我真正是他的老主顾了，他总给我最便宜的价钱。”</p> 
<p>“真的吗！那末，霍奇斯太太，如果他对你不会敲竹杠的话，我想麻烦你，请你去跟他安排一下丽莎的事。’’</p> 
<p>“好哇，没问题，肯普太太。只要我能够，我总是乐于帮人做好事的。”</p> 
<p>“我要把这事情办得很体面，’’肯普太太说。“我为女儿办丧葬，决不吝啬，你知道，我要排场，虽然那是有点多余的。”</p> 
<p>“不用担心，肯普太太，我一定使它办得象给我自己丈夫办丧葬一样，我话都说完了。</p> 
<p>“福特利先生很看得起我，的确！就在几天前，我到他店里去，他说，．霍奇斯太太，早上好。’我说，‘福特利先生，早上好。’</p> 
<p>“．你来得正好”他说。‘这位先生和我，’他指着站在旁边的另一位先生，．我们正在争论一个问题。喏，你是个有见识的女人，霍奇斯太太，而且又是我的老主顾。’</p> 
<p>“-这倒可以自己称得”我说，‘我有生意总是尽量拉来给你做的。’</p> 
<p>“．我相信你是的”他说。‘喂，’他说，‘现在请你说说看：</p> 
<p>“．棺材的材料是栎木比榆木好呢，还是榆木比栎木好？栎木还是榆木，就是这么个问题。’</p> 
<p>“‘哦，福特利先生，’我说，‘我个人的意见，如果你在棺材面上中央用黄铜镶嵌，两头各装黄铜把儿，那就没有比栎木更好的了。’</p> 
<p>“‘对啊，’他说，‘这就是我的想法。讲到棺材，最好永远给我栎木的，而且我希望，’他说，‘到上帝想到要召我回到他身边的时候，我自己将被放进一口栎木的棺材。，</p> 
<p>“‘阿门，’我说。”</p> 
<p>“我喜欢栎木，”肯普太太说。“我那可怜的丈夫，他用的就是栎木棺材。我们放他进去可费劲哪，我可以告诉你，你知道，他有水肿病，周身浮肿——啊，肿得不得了，肿得他亲娘也认不得他。</p> 
<p>呃，他的腿肿得同他身体一样粗，一点不假。”</p> 
<p>“当真！”霍奇斯太太叫起来。</p> 
<p>“是的，他一死，棺材送来了。当时我还没有跟福特利先生有往来关系。那个时候我们不住在这里，我们住在巴特西，所有丧葬的事情都由布朗宁先生办。就这样，布朗宁先生把棺材送来了，我们把我的老头儿放了进去，可是我们盖不上盖子，他肿得太厉害了。</p> 
<p>“正好布朗宁先生又高又大，足足有一百八九十磅。他站到了棺材盖上，他带来的一个小伙子也站了上去，但盖子就是盖不下去。于是布朗宁先生说——</p> 
<p>“‘跳上来，太太，’他说；我穿着寡妇的丧服，你知道，可是我们总得把盖子盖上，所以我也站了上去，我们大家一起跳，这才终于盖好，旋上螺钉。不过，天哪，我们可费劲哪；我永远忘不了。”</p> 
<p>接着，一片寂静。空气沉重得仿佛充塞着灰色的瘟疫，阴冷而令人窒息；这沉重的就是死亡。他们感觉到它来到了这屋子里，他们不敢动，他们不敢透气。寂静使人毛骨悚然。</p> 
<p>突然响起一个声音——一阵大声的哮吼。它从床上发出来，震动整个房间，打破了沉寂。</p> 
<p>医生揭开丽莎的一只眼睛，碰碰它，然后把他一直握着的她那只手按在她胸口上，拉起床单，遮没了她的头。</p> 
<p>吉姆脸上带着极度疲惫的神色转身离去。两个女人开始悄悄地呜咽起来。</p> 
<p>黑暗在黎明前渐渐消散，一道熹微的灰白光芒从窗口投射进来。灯火毕毕剥剥爆响着熄灭了。</p>
