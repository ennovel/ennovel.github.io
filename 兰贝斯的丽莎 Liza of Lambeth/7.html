Liza had got up early and strolled off to her work in good time, but she did not meet her faithful Sally on the way, nor find her at the factory when she herself arrived. The bell rang and all the girls trooped in, but still Sally did not come. Liza could not make it out, and was thinking she would be shut out, when just as the man who gave out the tokens for the day's work was pulling down the shutter in front of his window, Sally arrived, breathless and perspiring.</p> 
<p>'Whew! Go' lumme, I am 'ot!' she said, wiping her face with her apron.</p> 
<p>'I thought you wasn't comin',' said Liza.</p> 
<p>'Well, I only just did it; I overslep' myself. I was aht lite last night.'</p> 
<p>'Were yer?'</p> 
<p>'Me an' 'Arry went ter see the ply. Oh, Liza, it's simply spiffin'! I've never see sich a good ply in my life. Lor'! Why, it mikes yer blood run cold: they 'ang a man on the stige; oh, it mide me creep all over!'</p> 
<p>And then she began telling Liza all about it--the blood and thunder, the shooting, the railway train, the murder, the bomb, the hero, the funny man--jumbling everything up in her excitement, repeating little scraps of dialogue--all wrong--gesticulating, getting excited and red in the face at the recollection. Liza listened rather crossly, feeling bored at the detail into which Sally was going: the piece really didn't much interest her.</p> 
<p>'One 'ud think yer'd never been to a theatre in your life before,' she said.</p> 
<p>'I never seen anything so good, I can tell yer. You tike my tip, and git Tom ter tike yer.'</p> 
<p>'I don't want ter go; an' if I did I'd py for myself an' go alone.'</p> 
<p>'Cheese it! That ain't 'alf so good. Me an' 'Arry, we set together, 'im with 'is arm round my wiste and me oldin' 'is 'and. It was jam, I can tell yer!'</p> 
<p>'Well, I don't want anyone sprawlin' me abaht, thet ain't my mark!'</p> 
<p>'But I do like 'Arry; you dunno the little ways 'e 'as; an' we're goin' ter be married in three weeks now. 'Arry said, well, 'e says, "I'll git a licence." "Na," says I, "'ave the banns read aht in church: it seems more reg'lar like to 'ave banns; so they're goin' ter be read aht next Sunday. You'll come with me 'an 'ear them, won't yer, Liza?"'</p> 
<p>'Yus, I don't mind.'</p> 
<p>On the way home Sally insisted on stopping in front of the poster and explaining to Liza all about the scene represented.</p> 
<p>'Oh, you give me the sick with your "Fital Card", you do! I'm goin' 'ome.' And she left Sally in the midst of her explanation.</p> 
<p>'I dunno wot's up with Liza,' remarked Sally to a mutual friend. 'She's always got the needle, some'ow.'</p> 
<p>'Oh, she's barmy,' answered the friend.</p> 
<p>'Well, I do think she's a bit dotty sometimes--I do really,' rejoined Sally.</p> 
<p>Liza walked homewards, thinking of the play; at length she tossed her head impatiently.</p> 
<p>'I don't want ter see the blasted thing; an' if I see that there Jim I'll tell 'im so; swop me bob, I will.'</p> 
<p>She did see him; he was leaning with his back against the wall of his house, smoking. Liza knew he had seen her, and as she walked by pretended not to have noticed him. To her disgust, he let her pass, and she was thinking he hadn't seen her after all, when she heard him call her name.</p> 
<p>'Liza!'</p> 
<p>She turned round and started with surprise very well imitated. 'I didn't see you was there!' she said.</p> 
<p>'Why did yer pretend not ter notice me, as yer went past--eh, Liza?'</p> 
<p>'Why, I didn't see yer.'</p> 
<p>'Garn! But you ain't shirty with me?'</p> 
<p>'Wot 'ave I got to be shirty abaht?'</p> 
<p>He tried to take her hand, but she drew it away quickly. She was getting used to the movement. They went on talking, but Jim did not mention the theatre; Liza was surprised, and wondered whether he had forgotten.</p> 
<p>'Er--Sally went to the ply last night,' she said, at last.</p> 
<p>'Oh!' he said, and that was all.</p> 
<p>She got impatient.</p> 
<p>'Well, I'm off!' she said.</p> 
<p>'Na, don't go yet; I want ter talk ter yer,' he replied.</p> 
<p>'Wot abaht? anythin' in partickler?' She would drag it out of him if she possibly could.</p> 
<p>'Not thet I knows on,' he said, smiling.</p> 
<p>'Good night!' she said, abruptly, turning away from him.</p> 
<p>'Well, I'm damned if 'e ain't forgotten!' she said to herself, sulkily, as she marched home.</p> 
<p>The following evening about six o'clock, it suddenly struck her that it was the last night of the 'New and Sensational Drama'.</p> 
<p>'I do like thet Jim Blakeston,' she said to herself; 'fancy treatin' me like thet! You wouldn't catch Tom doin' sich a thing. Bli'me if I speak to 'im again, the ----. Now I shan't see it at all. I've a good mind ter go on my own 'ook. Fancy 'is forgettin' all abaht it, like thet!'</p> 
<p>She was really quite indignant; though, as she had distinctly refused Jim's offer, it was rather hard to see why.</p> 
<p>''E said 'e'd wite for me ahtside the doors; I wonder if 'e's there. I'll go an' see if 'e is, see if I don't--an' then if 'e's there, I'll go in on my own 'ook, jist ter spite 'im!'</p> 
<p>She dressed herself in her best, and, so that the neighbours shouldn't see her, went up a passage between some model lodging-house buildings, and in this roundabout way got into the Westminster Bridge Road, and soon found herself in front of the theatre.</p> 
<p>'I've been witin' for yer this 'alf-hour.'</p> 
<p>She turned round and saw Jim standing just behind her.</p> 
<p>''Oo are you talkin' to? I'm not goin' to the ply with you. Wot d'yer tike me for, eh?'</p> 
<p>''Oo are yer goin' with, then?'</p> 
<p>'I'm goin' alone.'</p> 
<p>'Garn! don't be a bloomin' jackass!'</p> 
<p>Liza was feeling very injured.</p> 
<p>'Thet's 'ow you treat me! I shall go 'ome. Why didn't you come aht the other night?'</p> 
<p>'Yer told me not ter.'</p> 
<p>She snorted at the ridiculous ineptitude of the reply.</p> 
<p>'Why didn't you say nothin' abaht it yesterday?'</p> 
<p>'Why, I thought you'd come if I didn't talk on it.'</p> 
<p>'Well, I think you're a ---- brute!' She felt very much inclined to cry.</p> 
<p>'Come on, Liza, don't tike on; I didn't mean no offence.' And he put his arm round her waist and led her to take their places at the gallery door. Two tears escaped from the corners of her eyes and ran down her nose, but she felt very relieved and happy, and let him lead her where he would.</p> 
<p>There was a long string of people waiting at the door, and Liza was delighted to see a couple of niggers who were helping them to while away the time of waiting. The niggers sang and danced, and made faces, while the people looked on with appreciative gravity, like royalty listening to de Reske, and they were very generous of applause and halfpence at the end of the performance. Then, when the niggers moved to the pit doors, paper boys came along offering _Tit-Bits_ and 'extra specials'; after that three little girls came round and sang sentimental songs and collected more halfpence. At last a movement ran through the serpent-like string of people, sounds were heard behind the door, everyone closed up, the men told the women to keep close and hold tight; there was a great unbarring and unbolting, the doors were thrown open, and, like a bursting river, the people surged in.</p> 
<p>Half an hour more and the curtain went up. The play was indeed thrilling. Liza quite forgot her companion, and was intent on the scene; she watched the incidents breathlessly, trembling with excitement, almost beside herself at the celebrated hanging incident. When the curtain fell on the first act she sighed and mopped her face.</p> 
<p>'See 'ow 'ot I am.' she said to Jim, giving him her hand.</p> 
<p>'Yus, you are!' he remarked, taking it.</p> 
<p>'Leave go!' she said, trying to withdraw it from him.</p> 
<p>'Not much,' he answered, quite boldly.</p> 
<p>'Garn! Leave go!' But he didn't, and she really did not struggle very violently.</p> 
<p>The second act came, and she shrieked over the comic man; and her laughter rang higher than anyone else's, so that people turned to look at her, and said:</p> 
<p>'She is enjoyin' 'erself.'</p> 
<p>Then when the murder came she bit her nails and the sweat stood on her forehead in great drops; in her excitement she even called out as loud as she could to the victim, 'Look aht!' It caused a laugh and slackened the tension, for the whole house was holding its breath as it looked at the villains listening at the door, creeping silently forward, crawling like tigers to their prey.</p> 
<p>Liza trembling all over, and in her terror threw herself against Jim, who put both his arms round her, and said:</p> 
<p>'Don't be afride, Liza; it's all right.'</p> 
<p>At last the men sprang, there was a scuffle, and the wretch was killed, then came the scene depicted on the posters--the victim's son knocking at the door, on the inside of which were the murderers and the murdered man. At last the curtain came down, and the house in relief burst forth into cheers and cheers; the handsome hero in his top hat was greeted thunderously; the murdered man, with his clothes still all disarranged, was hailed with sympathy; and the villains--the house yelled and hissed and booed, while the poor brutes bowed and tried to look as if they liked it.</p> 
<p>'I am enjoyin' myself,' said Liza, pressing herself quite close to Jim; 'you are a good sort ter tike me--Jim.'</p> 
<p>He gave her a little hug, and it struck her that she was sitting just as Sally had done, and, like Sally, she found it 'jam'.</p> 
<p>The _entr'actes_ were short and the curtain was soon up again, and the comic man raised customary laughter by undressing and exposing his nether garments to the public view; then more tragedy, and the final act with its darkened room, its casting lots, and its explosion.</p> 
<p>When it was all over and they had got outside Jim smacked his lips and said:</p> 
<p>'I could do with a gargle; let's go onto thet pub there.'</p> 
<p>'I'm as dry as bone,' said Liza; and so they went.</p> 
<p>When they got in they discovered they were hungry, and seeing some appetising sausage-rolls, ate of them, and washed them down with a couple of pots of beer; then Jim lit his pipe and they strolled off. They had got quite near the Westminster Bridge Road when Jim suggested that they should go and have one more drink before closing time.</p> 
<p>'I shall be tight,' said Liza.</p> 
<p>'Thet don't matter,' answered Jim, laughing. 'You ain't got ter go ter work in the mornin' an' you can sleep it aht.'</p> 
<p>'Arright, I don't mind if I do then, in for a penny, in for a pound.'</p> 
<p>At the pub door she drew back.</p> 
<p>'I say, guv'ner,' she said, 'there'll be some of the coves from dahn our street, and they'll see us.'</p> 
<p>'Na, there won't be nobody there, don't yer 'ave no fear.'</p> 
<p>'I don't like ter go in for fear of it.'</p> 
<p>'Well, we ain't doin' no 'arm if they does see us, an' we can go into the private bar, an' you bet your boots there won't be no one there.'</p> 
<p>She yielded, and they went in.</p> 
<p>'Two pints of bitter, please, miss,' ordered Jim.</p> 
<p>'I say, 'old 'ard. I can't drink more than 'alf a pint,' said Liza.</p> 
<p>'Cheese it,' answered Jim. 'You can do with all you can get, I know.'</p> 
<p>At closing time they left and walked down the broad road which led homewards.</p> 
<p>'Let's 'ave a little sit dahn,' said Jim, pointing to an empty bench between two trees.</p> 
<p>'Na, it's gettin' lite; I want ter be 'ome.'</p> 
<p>'It's such a fine night, it's a pity ter go in already;' and he drew her unresisting towards the seat. He put his arm round her waist.</p> 
<p>'Un'and me, villin!' she said, in apt misquotation of the melodrama, but Jim only laughed, and she made no effort to disengage herself.</p> 
<p>They sat there for a long while in silence; the beer had got to Liza's head, and the warm night air filled her with a double intoxication. She felt the arm round her waist, and the big, heavy form pressing against her side; she experienced again the curious sensation as if her heart were about to burst, and it choked her--a feeling so oppressive and painful it almost made her feel sick. Her hands began to tremble, and her breathing grew rapid, as though she were suffocating. Almost fainting, she swayed over towards the man, and a cold shiver ran through her from top to toe. Jim bent over her, and, taking her in both arms, he pressed his lips to hers in a long, passionate kiss. At last, panting for breath, she turned her head away and groaned.</p> 
<p>Then they again sat for a long while in silence, Liza full of a strange happiness, feeling as if she could laugh aloud hysterically, but restrained by the calm and silence of the night. Close behind struck a church clock--one.</p> 
<p>'Bless my soul!' said Liza, starting, 'there's one o'clock. I must get 'ome.'</p> 
<p>'It's so nice out 'ere; do sty, Liza.' He pressed her closer to him. 'Yer know, Liza, I love yer--fit ter kill.'</p> 
<p>'Na, I can't stay; come on.' She got up from the seat, and pulled him up too. 'Come on,' she said.</p> 
<p>Without speaking they went along, and there was no one to be seen either in front or behind them. He had not got his arm round her now, and they were walking side by side, slightly separated. It was Liza who spoke first.</p> 
<p>'You'd better go dahn the Road and by the church an' git into Vere Street the other end, an' I'll go through the passage, so thet no one shouldn't see us comin' together,' she spoke almost in a whisper.</p> 
<p>'Arright, Liza,' he answered, 'I'll do just as you tell me.'</p> 
<p>They came to the passage of which Liza spoke; it was a narrow way between blank walls, the backs of factories, and it led into the upper end of Vere Street. The entrance to it was guarded by two iron posts in the middle so that horses or barrows should not be taken through.</p> 
<p>They had just got to it when a man came out into the open road. Liza quickly turned her head away.</p> 
<p>'I wonder if 'e see us,' she said, when he had passed out of earshot. ''E's lookin' back,' she added.</p> 
<p>'Why, 'oo is it?' asked Jim.</p> 
<p>'It's a man aht of our street,' she answered. 'I dunno 'im, but I know where 'e lodges. D'yer think 'e sees us?'</p> 
<p>'Na, 'e wouldn't know 'oo it was in the dark.'</p> 
<p>'But he looked round; all the street'll know it if he see us.'</p> 
<p>'Well, we ain't doin' no 'arm.'</p> 
<p>She stretched out her hand to say good night.</p> 
<p>'I'll come a wy with yer along the passage,' said Jim.</p> 
<p>'Na, you mustn't; you go straight round.'</p> 
<p>'But it's so dark; p'raps summat'll 'appen to yer.'</p> 
<p>'Not it! You go on 'ome an' leave me,' she replied, and entering the passage, stood facing him with one of the iron pillars between them.</p> 
<p>'Good night, old cock,' she said, stretching out her hand. He took it, and said:</p> 
<p>'I wish yer wasn't goin' ter leave me, Liza.'</p> 
<p>'Garn! I must!' She tried to get her hand away from his, but he held it firm, resting it on the top of the pillar.</p> 
<p>'Leave go my 'and,' she said. He made no movement, but looked into her eyes steadily, so that it made her uneasy. She repented having come out with him. 'Leave go my 'and.' And she beat down on his with her closed fist.</p> 
<p>'Liza!' he said, at last.</p> 
<p>'Well, wot is it?' she answered, still thumping down on his hand with her fist.</p> 
<p>'Liza,' he said a whisper, 'will yer?'</p> 
<p>'Will I wot?' she said, looking down.</p> 
<p>'You know, Liza. Sy, will yer?'</p> 
<p>'Na,' she said.</p> 
<p>He bent over her and repeated--</p> 
<p>'Will yer?'</p> 
<p>She did not speak, but kept beating down on his hand.</p> 
<p>'Liza,' he said again, his voice growing hoarse and thick--'Liza, will yer?'</p> 
<p>She still kept silence, looking away and continually bringing down her fist. He looked at her a moment, and she, ceasing to thump his hand, looked up at him with half-opened mouth. Suddenly he shook himself, and closing his fist gave her a violent, swinging blow in the belly.</p> 
<p>'Come on.' he said.</p> 
<p>And together they slid down into the darkness of the passage.</p> 
<p>过了两天；是个星期五的早晨。丽莎起得很早，有宽裕的时间踱着步上工去，但她一路上没有遇到她的忠实朋友萨莉，到了厂里也没看见她。</p> 
<p>钟声响了，姑娘们一群群都往厂里拥，唯独依然不见萨莉到来。丽莎不知这是怎么回事，怕萨莉将被关出在厂外。正在发出勤牌子的人要拉下他窗口的百叶窗的时候，萨莉赶到了，气吁吁、汗淋淋的。</p> 
<p>“唷！天哪，我热死了！”她说，一边用围裙揩脸上的汗水。</p> 
<p>“我当你不来了，”丽莎说。</p> 
<p>“不，我正好赶进；我睡过头了。我昨天夜里出去了，回来很晚。’’</p> 
<p>“是吗？”</p> 
<p>“我和哈利去看那个戏的。哦，丽莎，那个戏简直好看极了！我一生从来没看过这样的好戏。天哪！它使你紧张得血都发冷。他们在台上把一个人绞死，哦，使我浑身都起了鸡皮疙瘩！”</p> 
<p>接着她把这戏的情节，从头到底详详细细讲给丽莎听暴力和流血呀，开枪呀，火车呀，凶杀呀，炸弹呀，英雄呀，小丑呀——她在激动的心情下把剧情杂乱无章地讲给她听，还背诵几段对话一全背错的——指手划脚地做出各种姿势；她回忆起这一切，兴奋得满面通红。</p> 
<p>丽莎听得不耐烦，对萨莉讲得那么噜苏觉得讨厌：她对这个戏实在不感兴趣。</p> 
<p>“人家会觉得，好象你一生从来没有进过戏院似的，”她说。</p> 
<p>“我从来没有看过这样好的戏，我可以告诉你。你听我的话，叫汤姆带你去看。”</p> 
<p>“我不要去I要去的话，我也自己买票、一个人去。”</p> 
<p>“得了！那有什么味儿？我和哈利，我们坐在一起，他揽着我的腰，我握着他的手，这才乐哪，我可以告诉你！”</p> 
<p>“嗯，我可不要任何人在我身上抚抚摸摸；我不喜欢！”</p> 
<p>“可是我喜欢哈利；你不知道他的那些小动作哩；我们过三个星期就要结婚了。哈利说，他说‘我要去领张结婚证书’。‘不，’我说，‘要在教堂里宣读结婚预告，这样似乎更正式；’所以这个星期天将宣读我们的结婚预告。你跟我一起去听，好不好？”</p> 
<p>“好哇，我一起去。”</p> 
<p>放工后，在回家的途中，萨莉一定要在戏院广告前面停下，把广告上的那个场面详细解释给丽莎听。</p> 
<p>“啊，你的《致命的纸牌》叫人恶心，我真要恶心了！我要回家去了。’’她不等萨莉解释完，管自走了。</p> 
<p>“我不知丽莎怎么了，”萨莉对一个她们共同的朋友说。“不知为什么，她总是不乐意。”</p> 
<p>“哦，她是个傻子，”那个朋友说。</p> 
<p>“是啊．我觉得她有时候真有点痴呆——我确实有这样的感觉，”萨莉回答说。</p> 
<p>丽莎朝着家里走去，一路想着那个戏；终于她不耐烦地把头往后一仰。</p> 
<p>“我不要看这该死的戏。我如果见到吉姆那个家伙，就对他这样讲；我一定这样讲！”</p> 
<p>她果然看见他了；他背靠着他家的墙，在抽烟。丽莎知道他已经看到她，她经过他面前，只装没有注意到他。她觉得可恶的是，他让她走过去，而当她正以为他可能并没有看见她的时候，却听见他叫唤她的名字。</p> 
<p>“丽莎！’’</p> 
<p>她回过头去，吃了一惊的样子——装得很象。“我没看见你在那儿！”她说。</p> 
<p>“你走过去的时候，为什么假装没看到我——嗯，丽莎？”</p> 
<p>“呀，我是没有看见你。”</p> 
<p>“胡说！你可不是跟我生气吧？”</p> 
<p>“我生什么气？”</p> 
<p>他想要握住她的手，但她迅速缩回了。她已经习惯于这个动作。他们继续交谈下去，可是吉姆始终不提看戏的事，丽莎很奇怪，心想他会不会忘记了。</p> 
<p>“呃——萨莉昨天夜里去看戏的，”最后是她说。</p> 
<p>“噢！”他说；就这么一声。</p> 
<p>她忍受不住了。</p> 
<p>“好，我走了！”她说。</p> 
<p>“不，不要就走；我有话要跟你说．”他回答。</p> 
<p>“什么话？有什么事？”她拼命想引出看戏的话题。</p> 
<p>“我也不知道．”他微笑着说。</p> 
<p>“再见！”她说着，急促地转身离开了他。</p> 
<p>“哼，肯定他全忘了!”她一边走回家，一边心里想，气鼓鼓地。</p> 
<p>第二天晚上六点光景，她忽然想到今夜是这本“新型惊险剧”的最后一场。</p> 
<p>“我确实是喜欢那个吉姆·布莱克斯顿的，”她暗自思忖，“而他竟这样对待我！汤姆决不会象他那样。我死也不再理睬他，那个——。现在我将根本看不成这本戏了。我真想自个儿去。瞧他忘记得那么干干净净！”</p> 
<p>她非常气愤，虽然很难说为什么气愤，因为是她自己清清楚楚拒绝了吉姆的请求的。</p> 
<p>“他说他会在戏院外面等我的，不知他会不会在那里。我要去看看他到底在不在那里，我L定要去看看——要是他在的话，我就自己买了票进去看戏，偏要气气他。”</p> 
<p>她穿上了她的漂亮衣裳，为了不让邻居看见，特地从几幢模范工房中间的小弄里穿出去，兜到威斯敏斯特桥大道，不多一会就到了戏院门前。</p> 
<p>“我等你半个小时了。”</p> 
<p>她回头看时，只见吉姆站在她背后。</p> 
<p>“你在跟谁说话？我可不是来跟你一起去看戏的。你把我当什么来着？’’</p> 
<p>“那你跟谁一起去？”</p> 
<p>“我一个人去。”</p> 
<p>“得了！别成了该死的蠢驴！”</p> 
<p>丽莎觉得受了极大的侮辱。</p> 
<p>“你就是这样对待我！我回家去了。你那天夜里为什么不出来？”</p> 
<p>“你教我不要出来的嘛。”</p> 
<p>她听了这悖谬可笑的回答，哼了一声。</p> 
<p>“你昨天为什么只字不提看戏的事呢？”</p> 
<p>“咦，我想如果我不谈这件事，你准会来。”</p> 
<p>“好哇，我想你真是——畜生！”她真要哭出来。</p> 
<p>“好吧，丽莎，别激动，我并不存心惹恼你。”</p> 
<p>他用手臂挽着她的腰，把她带到戏院走廊门口。</p> 
<p>她眼角里涌出两颗泪珠，沿着鼻子滚下，但是她感到宽慰和快活，任他带到什么地方去。</p> 
<p>门口等着一长条的人。丽莎看见两个黑人在帮他们消磨等待的时间，心里高兴。黑人唱歌、跳舞、又做怪脸，大家聚精会神地看得津津有味，有如王家贵族在静听雷斯凯注演唱。在表演完毕的时候，大家热烈鼓掌，并且踊跃向他们投赠半便士的铜币。</p> 
<p>当黑人们退到楼下后座的进口处时，报童们又叫卖起小报和号外来；这之后来了三个小姑娘，唱着爱情歌曲，又拿到一些铜币。</p> 
<p>终于门里边响起了声音，门口排成一字长蛇阵的人们骚动起来，每个人都挤拢来，男的叫女的挨紧、拉住I一片劈里啪啦开锁去闩的声音，门都打开了，人们就象决了堤的河流一样向场子里直冲进去。</p> 
<p>过了半个小时，幕开了。这戏确实惊险动人。丽莎完全忘记了她的伴侣，专心一志地盯着台上。她看得气也透不过来．激动得发抖，看到绞杀人的那个精采场面时，她几乎发疯了。</p> 
<p>第一幕幕落，她舒了口气，揩揩脸上的汗。</p> 
<p>“瞧我好热呀，”她对吉姆说．把手给他摸。</p> 
<p>“是呀，你热了！”他拿住她的手。</p> 
<p>“放开！”她说，要把手缩回来。</p> 
<p>“有什么关系？”他非常大胆地回答。</p> 
<p>“去！放开！”但是他不放，她也并不真正强烈挣扎。</p> 
<p>第二幕开场了。她看见了那小丑，尖叫起来；她的笑声比任何人都大，因此人们都回过头来看她，说道——</p> 
<p>“她看得可开心。”</p> 
<p>后来，到谋杀的一场，她尽是咬指甲，额上汗流如注。她紧张得甚至力竭声嘶地对那将被杀害的人大叫起来，“当心！”这一下引起了哄堂大笑，也松弛了紧张空气，因为全场正屏气凝视着两个坏人在门口侧耳静听，蹑手蹑脚地向他走去，宛如老虎在爬向它要捕食的动物。</p> 
<p>丽莎周身哆嗦，吓得紧挨着吉姆，他就双手把她抱住，对她说——</p> 
<p>“别害怕，丽莎；没事。”</p> 
<p>最后坏人们猛扑上去，一场搏斗，可怜的人被杀；接着就是广告上画的那个场面——被害者的儿子在外面敲门，里面是两个凶手和那被杀害的人。</p> 
<p>幕落下，全场观众松了一口气，接着爆发出一阵阵的喝彩声。那戴着大礼帽的漂亮的英雄受到雷声般的鼓掌；被杀害的人．依然弄得蓬头散发、衣衫零乱的样子，受到同情的欢呼；坏蛋们呢，全场报以一片嘘嘘、呸呸的喧哗，而那两个可怜的家伙还是连连鞠躬，似乎表示深深感谢。</p> 
<p>“我看得好看极了，”丽莎说，把身子紧紧贴拢吉姆，“你带我来看这戏，你真好——吉姆。”</p> 
<p>他紧紧抱了她一下，她忽然想起，她正同萨莉说的一样地坐着，她同萨莉一样“够味儿”。</p> 
<p>幕间休息的时间很短，不一会幕又升起了。</p> 
<p>小丑脱去了衣服，把衬衣衬裤公诸于众，引起观众惯常的哄堂大笑；然后又是悲剧，最后一幕是一间黑沉沉的房间、抽签、爆炸。</p> 
<p>当戏演完了，散场出来的时候，吉姆咂着嘴唇，说道——</p> 
<p>“我得喝口酒；我们到那边小酒店去。”</p> 
<p>“我也渴得要命，”丽莎说；所以他们就去了。</p> 
<p>走进小酒店，他们觉得肚子饿了，看见刺激食欲的香肠卷，吃了一些，同时灌下了两罐啤酒。然后吉姆点起烟斗，他们离开了小酒店。</p> 
<p>他们走到快近威斯敏斯特桥大道的时候，吉姆建议趁酒店还没打烊再去喝几杯。</p> 
<p>“我要醉了，”丽莎说。</p> 
<p>“没有关系．”吉姆笑着答道。“你明天早晨又不用上班，多睡一会就是。”</p> 
<p>“好吧，那么我去；反正喝了，就索性喝吧。”</p> 
<p>她到了酒店门口，脚步缩住了。</p> 
<p>“我说，大爷，”她说，“这里会有我们街上的人，他们会看见我们的。”</p> 
<p>“不，不会有人，你放心。”</p> 
<p>“我怕进去。”</p> 
<p>“嗳，就是他们看见我们，我们又不是在做什么坏事，而且我们可以到里边的小房间去，包管你那儿一个人也没有。”</p> 
<p>她顺从了。他们进了酒店。</p> 
<p>“请来两品脱苦啤酒，小姐．”吉姆对女侍者说。</p> 
<p>“嗳，老朋友。我至多喝半品脱．”丽莎说。</p> 
<p>“胡说．”吉姆回答。“你是有多少能喝多少的．我知道。”</p> 
<p>他们到酒店关门的时候才离开酒店．沿着宽广的大道向回家的路上走去。</p> 
<p>“我们在这里坐一会儿．”吉姆指着两棵树间的一张空凳子说。</p> 
<p>“不，时间晚了；我要回家了。”</p> 
<p>“那么好的夜晚，要紧回家去岂不可惜I"他拉她坐下．她并不推拒。他拿手臂在她的腰里揽着。</p> 
<p>“放手，坏蛋！”她随口胡乱引用那传奇剧里的话说；可是吉姆只哈哈笑笑，她也不挣脱他的搂抱。</p> 
<p>他们在那里坐着，沉默了好一阵子I啤酒涌上她头里，热烘烘的夜晚的空气更使她昏昏沉沉。</p> 
<p>她觉得他的手臂揽在她腰里，高大的身躯紧贴在她身旁；她重又感受到那种奇异的激情，仿佛她的心就要爆炸，这激情使她透不过气来——一种那么痛苦、压迫的感觉几乎使她要打恶心。她的手发起抖来，呼吸越来越急迫，似乎竟要窒息了。她昏昏迷迷地倒在那男人身上，从头顶到脚尖一阵寒颤。</p> 
<p>吉姆俯倒身子，双手抱住她，在她嘴唇上压上了一个长长的热吻。她气喘吁吁地掉转头，低声呻吟。</p> 
<p>他们又默默无言地坐了好一阵子，丽莎只觉异样的喜悦，仿佛将歇斯底里地大笑起来。</p> 
<p>就在背后，教堂的钟声敲起——一点！</p> 
<p>“天哪！”丽莎一震动，说道，“一点啦！我必须回家了。”</p> 
<p>“这儿外面多凉快，再待一会儿，丽莎。”他把她抱得更紧。“你知道，丽莎，我爱你——爱得恨不得把你杀了。”</p> 
<p>“不，我不能再待下去；走吧。”她从凳子上站起身来，把他也拖起。“走吧，”她说。</p> 
<p>他们一路走去，又是默默无言地；前前后后不看见一个人。他这会儿没挽住她。他们稍稍分开着并肩走去。</p> 
<p>丽莎先开口。</p> 
<p>“你最好沿这大道，绕着教堂，兜回维尔街，我穿小弄走，这样没有人会看见我们在一起；”她几乎耳语般地说。</p> 
<p>“好，丽莎，”他答道，“你叫我怎样，我就怎样。”</p> 
<p>他们来到了丽莎所说那条小弄口；这条小弄两边都是没有门窗的墙，是工厂的背面，它通向维尔街的末梢头。弄口中央设有两个铁桩，不让马匹和车辆通行。</p> 
<p>他们刚到得那里，忽然小弄里走出一个人来，正拐弯上大路上去。丽莎连忙把头掉转。</p> 
<p>“不知他看见我们没有．”待他走远了些，她说。“他在回头看，”她又说。</p> 
<p>“嗯，这是谁？”吉姆问。</p> 
<p>“是我们街上的人．”她答道。“我不认识他，可我知道他住在哪一家。你猜他看见我们吗？”</p> 
<p>“不，他在黑暗里看不出是谁的。”</p> 
<p>“但是他回过头来看的；要是他看见是我们，整条街上的人就将全都知道。”</p> 
<p>“这也没什么，我们又不是在干坏事。”</p> 
<p>她伸出手，要对他说再见。</p> 
<p>“我陪你在小弄里走一段．”吉姆说。</p> 
<p>“不，你不能陪我；你这就兜过去定吧。”</p> 
<p>“可小弄里那么暗；也许会出什么事情。”</p> 
<p>“不可能！你回家去吧，别管我．”她一面说着，一面走进小弄里，隔着一个铁桩和吉姆对面站住。</p> 
<p>“再见，老朋友，’’她伸出手说。</p> 
<p>他握住了她的手，说道——</p> 
<p>“我但愿你不要离开我，丽莎。”</p> 
<p>“好啦，我必须走了！”她想要缩回她的手，但是他把它紧紧压住在铁桩顶上。</p> 
<p>“放开我的手，”她说。</p> 
<p>他不动，却一味盯住了她的眼睛，弄得她心慌起来。她懊悔不该跟他出来。</p> 
<p>“放开我的手，’’说完，她握紧拳头打他的手。</p> 
<p>“丽莎！”末了他说。</p> 
<p>“嗯，怎么样？”她一边说，一边不断用拳头狠狠打他的手。</p> 
<p>“丽莎，”他轻轻地说，“你肯吗？”</p> 
<p>“肯什么？”她说，低下了头。</p> 
<p>“你知道的，丽莎。说，你肯吗？”</p> 
<p>“不，”她说。</p> 
<p>他凑到她耳边，重复说——</p> 
<p>“你肯吗？’’</p> 
<p>她默不作声，尽是打他的手。</p> 
<p>“丽莎．”他还是说，声音变得嘶哑、粗重——“丽莎，你肯吗？”</p> 
<p>她依然不响，眼睛朝着别处，拳头尽乱打。</p> 
<p>他定睛对她看了一会，她停住了在猛打他的手，半张着嘴抬头瞧着他。突然间，他一阵震颤，握紧拳头，狠狠地在她肚子上砰的一拳。“来吧．”他说。终于他们两个一起向小弄的黑暗中悄悄走去。</p>
