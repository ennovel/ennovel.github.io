They were both of them rather stale and bedraggled after the day's outing; their fringes were ragged and untidily straying over their foreheads, their back hair, carelessly tied in a loose knot, fell over their necks and threatened completely to come down. Liza had not had time to put her hat on, and was holding it in her hand. Sally's was pinned on sideways, and she had to bash it down on her head every now and then to prevent its coming off. Cinderella herself was not more transformed than they were; but Cinderella even in her rags was virtuously tidy and patched up, while Sally had a great tear in her shabby dress, and Liza's stockings were falling over her boots.</p> 
<p>'Wot cheer, Sal!' said Liza, when she caught her up.</p> 
<p>'Oh, I 'ave got sich a 'ead on me this mornin'!' she remarked, turning round a pale face: heavily lined under the eyes.</p> 
<p>'I don't feel too chirpy neither,' said Liza, sympathetically.</p> 
<p>'I wish I 'adn't drunk so much beer,' added Sally, as a pang shot through her head.</p> 
<p>'Oh, you'll be arright in a bit,' said Liza. Just then they heard the clock strike eight, and they began to run so that they might not miss getting their tokens and thereby their day's pay; they turned into the street at the end of which was the factory, and saw half a hundred women running like themselves to get in before it was too late.</p> 
<p>All the morning Liza worked in a dead-and-alive sort of fashion, her head like a piece of lead with electric shocks going through it when she moved, and her tongue and mouth hot and dry. At last lunch-time came.</p> 
<p>'Come on, Sal,' said Liza, 'I'm goin' to 'ave a glass o' bitter. I can't stand this no longer.'</p> 
<p>So they entered the public-house opposite, and in one draught finished their pots. Liza gave a long sigh of relief.</p> 
<p>'That bucks you up, don't it?'</p> 
<p>'I was dry! I ain't told yer yet, Liza, 'ave I? 'E got it aht last night.'</p> 
<p>'Who d'yer mean?'</p> 
<p>'Why, 'Arry. 'E spit it aht at last.'</p> 
<p>'Arst yer ter nime the day?' said Liza, smiling.</p> 
<p>'Thet's it.'</p> 
<p>'And did yer?'</p> 
<p>'Didn't I jest!' answered Sally, with some emphasis. 'I always told yer I'd git off before you.'</p> 
<p>'Yus!' said Liza, thinking.</p> 
<p>'Yer know, Liza, you'd better tike Tom; 'e ain't a bad sort.' She was quite patronizing.</p> 
<p>'I'm goin' ter tike 'oo I like; an' it ain't nobody's business but mine.'</p> 
<p>'Arright, Liza, don't get shirty over it; I don't mean no offence.'</p> 
<p>'What d'yer say it for then?'</p> 
<p>'Well, I thought as seeing as yer'd gone aht with 'im yesterday thet yer meant ter after all.'</p> 
<p>''E wanted ter tike me; I didn't arsk 'im.'</p> 
<p>'Well, I didn't arsk my 'Arry, either.'</p> 
<p>'I never said yer did,' replied Liza.</p> 
<p>'Oh, you've got the 'ump, you 'ave!' finished Sally, rather angrily.</p> 
<p>The beer had restored Liza: she went back to work without a headache, and, except for a slight languor, feeling no worse for the previous day's debauch. As she worked on she began going over in her mind the events of the preceding day, and she found entwined in all her thoughts the burly person of Jim Blakeston. She saw him walking by her side in the Forest, presiding over the meals, playing the concertina, singing, joking, and finally, on the drive back, she felt the heavy form by her side, and the big, rough hand holding hers, while Tom's arm was round her waist. Tom! That was the first time he had entered her mind, and he sank into a shadow beside the other. Last of all she remembered the walk home from the pub, the good nights, and the rapid footsteps as Jim caught her up, and the kiss. She blushed and looked up quickly to see whether any of the girls were looking at her; she could not help thinking of that moment when he took her in his arms; she still felt the roughness of his beard pressing on her mouth. Her heart seemed to grow larger in her breast, and she caught for breath as she threw back her head as if to receive his lips again. A shudder ran through her from the vividness of the thought.</p> 
<p>'Wot are you shiverin' for, Liza?' asked one of the girls. 'You ain't cold.'</p> 
<p>'Not much,' answered Liza, blushing awkwardly on her meditations being broken into. 'Why, I'm sweatin' so--I'm drippin' wet.'</p> 
<p>'I expect yer caught cold in the Faurest yesterday.'</p> 
<p>'I see your mash as I was comin' along this mornin'.'</p> 
<p>Liza stared a little.</p> 
<p>'I ain't got one, 'oo d'yer mean, ay?'</p> 
<p>'Yer only Tom, of course. 'E did look washed aht. Wot was yer doin' with 'im yesterday?'</p> 
<p>''E ain't got nothin' ter do with me, 'e ain't.'</p> 
<p>'Garn, don't you tell me!'</p> 
<p>The bell rang, and, throwing over their work, the girls trooped off, and after chattering in groups outside the factory gates for a while, made their way in different directions to their respective homes. Liza and Sally went along together.</p> 
<p>'I sy, we are comin' aht!' cried Sally, seeing the advertisement of a play being acted at the neighbouring theatre.</p> 
<p>'I should like ter see thet!' said Liza, as they stood arm-in-arm in front of the flaring poster. It represented two rooms and a passage in between; in one room a dead man was lying on the floor, while two others were standing horror-stricken, listening to a youth who was in the passage, knocking at the door.</p> 
<p>'You see, they've 'killed im,' said Sally, excitedly.</p> 
<p>'Yus, any fool can see thet! an' the one ahtside, wot's 'e doin' of?'</p> 
<p>'Ain't 'e beautiful? I'll git my 'Arry ter tike me, I will. I should like ter see it. 'E said 'e'd tike me to the ply.'</p> 
<p>They strolled on again, and Liza, leaving Sally, made her way to her mother's. She knew she must pass Jim's house, and wondered whether she would see him. But as she walked along the street she saw Tom coming the opposite way; with a sudden impulse she turned back so as not to meet him, and began walking the way she had come. Then thinking herself a fool for what she had done, she turned again and walked towards him. She wondered if she had seen her or noticed her movement, but when she looked down the street he was nowhere to be seen; he had not caught sight of her, and had evidently gone in to see a mate in one or other of the houses. She quickened her step, and passing the house where lived Jim, could not help looking up; he was standing at the door watching her, with a smile on his lips.</p> 
<p>'I didn't see yer, Mr. Blakeston,' she said, as he came up to her.</p> 
<p>'Didn't yer? Well, I knew yer would; an' I was witin' for yer ter look up. I see yer before ter-day.'</p> 
<p>'Na, when?'</p> 
<p>'I passed be'ind yer as you an' thet other girl was lookin' at the advertisement of thet ply.'</p> 
<p>'I never see yer.'</p> 
<p>'Na, I know yer didn't. I 'ear yer say, you says: "I should like to see thet."'</p> 
<p>'Yus, an' I should too.'</p> 
<p>'Well, I'll tike yer.'</p> 
<p>'You?'</p> 
<p>'Yus; why not?'</p> 
<p>'I like thet; wot would yer missus sy?'</p> 
<p>'She wouldn't know.'</p> 
<p>'But the neighbours would!'</p> 
<p>'No they wouldn't, no one 'd see us.'</p> 
<p>He was speaking in a low voice so that people could not hear.</p> 
<p>'You could meet me ahtside the theatre,' he went on.</p> 
<p>'Na, I couldn't go with you; you're a married man.'</p> 
<p>'Garn! wot's the matter--jest ter go ter the ply? An' besides, my missus can't come if she wanted, she's got the kids ter look after.'</p> 
<p>'I should like ter see it,' said Liza meditatively.</p> 
<p>They had reached her house, and Jim said:</p> 
<p>'Well, come aht this evenin' and tell me if yer will--eh, Liza?'</p> 
<p>'Na, I'm not comin' aht this evening.'</p> 
<p>'Thet won't 'urt yer. I shall wite for yer.'</p> 
<p>''Tain't a bit of good your witing', 'cause I shan't come.'</p> 
<p>'Well, then, look 'ere, Liza; next Saturday night's the last night, an' I shall go to the theatre, any'ow. An' if you'll come, you just come to the door at 'alf-past six, an' you'll find me there. See?'</p> 
<p>'Na, I don't,' said Liza, firmly.</p> 
<p>'Well, I shall expect yer.'</p> 
<p>'I shan't come, so you needn't expect.' And with that she walked into the house and slammed the door behind her.</p> 
<p>Her mother had not come in from her day's charing, and Liza set about getting her tea. She thought it would be rather lonely eating it alone, so pouring out a cup of tea and putting a little condensed milk into it, she cut a huge piece of bread-and-butter, and sat herself down outside on the doorstep. Another woman came downstairs, and seeing Liza, sat down by her side and began to talk.</p> 
<p>'Why, Mrs. Stanley, wot 'ave yer done to your 'ead?' asked Liza, noticing a bandage round her forehead.</p> 
<p>'I 'ad an accident last night,' answered the woman, blushing uneasily.</p> 
<p>'Oh, I am sorry! Wot did yer do to yerself?'</p> 
<p>'I fell against the coal-scuttle and cut my 'ead open.'</p> 
<p>'Well, I never!'</p> 
<p>'To tell yer the truth, I 'ad a few words with my old man. But one doesn't like them things to get abaht; yer won't tell anyone, will yer?'</p> 
<p>'Not me!' answered Liza. 'I didn't know yer husband was like thet.'</p> 
<p>'Oh, 'e's as gentle as a lamb when 'e's sober,' said Mrs. Stanley, apologetically. 'But, Lor' bless yer, when 'e's 'ad a drop too much 'e's a demond, an' there's no two ways abaht it.'</p> 
<p>'An' you ain't been married long neither?' said Liza.</p> 
<p>'Na, not above eighteen months; ain't it disgriceful? Thet's wot the doctor at the 'orspital says ter me. I 'ad ter go ter the 'orspital. You should have seen 'ow it bled!--it bled all dahn' my fice, and went streamin' like a bust waterpipe. Well, it fair frightened my old man, an' I says ter 'im, "I'll charge yer," an' although I was bleedin' like a bloomin' pig I shook my fist at 'im, an' I says, "I'll charge ye--see if I don't!" An' 'e says, "Na," says 'e, "don't do thet, for God's sike, Kitie, I'll git three months." "An' serve yer damn well right!" says I, an' I went aht an' left 'im. But, Lor' bless yer, I wouldn't charge 'im! I know 'e don't mean it; 'e's as gentle as a lamb when 'e's sober.' She smiled quite affectionately as she said this.</p> 
<p>'Wot did yer do, then?' asked Liza.</p> 
<p>'Well, as I wos tellin' yer, I went to the 'orspital, an' the doctor 'e says to me, "My good woman," says 'e, "you might have been very seriously injured." An' me not been married eighteen months! An' as I was tellin' the doctor all about it, "Missus," 'e says ter me, lookin' at me straight in the eyeball. "Missus," says 'e, "'ave you been drinkin'?" "Drinkin'?" says I; "no! I've 'ad a little drop, but as for drinkin'! Mind," says I, "I don't say I'm a teetotaller--I'm not, I 'ave my glass of beer, and I like it. I couldn't do withaht it, wot with the work I 'ave, I must 'ave somethin' ter keep me tergether. But as for drinkin' 'eavily! Well! I can say this, there ain't a soberer woman than myself in all London. Why, my first 'usband never touched a drop. Ah, my first 'usband, 'e was a beauty, 'e was."'</p> 
<p>She stopped the repetition of her conversation and addressed herself to Liza.</p> 
<p>''E was thet different ter this one. 'E was a man as 'ad seen better days. 'E was a gentleman!' She mouthed the word and emphasized it with an expressive nod.</p> 
<p>''E was a gentleman and a Christian. 'E'd been in good circumstances in 'is time; an' 'e was a man of education and a teetotaller, for twenty-two years.'</p> 
<p>At that moment Liza's mother appeared on the scene.</p> 
<p>'Good evenin', Mrs. Stanley,' she said, politely.</p> 
<p>'The sime ter you, Mrs. Kemp.' replied that lady, with equal courtesy.</p> 
<p>'An' 'ow is your poor 'ead?' asked Liza's mother, with sympathy.</p> 
<p>'Oh, it's been achin' cruel. I've hardly known wot ter do with myself.'</p> 
<p>'I'm sure 'e ought ter be ashimed of 'imself for treatin' yer like thet.'</p> 
<p>'Oh, it wasn't 'is blows I minded so much, Mrs. Kemp,' replied Mrs. Stanley, 'an' don't you think it. It was wot 'e said ter me. I can stand a blow as well as any woman. I don't mind thet, an' when 'e don't tike a mean advantage of me I can stand up for myself an' give as good as I tike; an' many's the time I give my fust husband a black eye. But the language 'e used, an' the things 'e called me! It made me blush to the roots of my 'air; I'm not used ter bein' spoken ter like thet. I was in good circumstances when my fust 'usband was alive, 'e earned between two an' three pound a week, 'e did. As I said to 'im this mornin', "'Ow a gentleman can use sich language, I dunno."'</p> 
<p>''Usbands is cautions, 'owever good they are,' said Mrs. Kemp, aphoristically. 'But I mustn't stay aht 'ere in the night air.'</p> 
<p>''As yer rheumatism been troublin' yer litely?' asked Mrs. Stanley.</p> 
<p>'Oh, cruel. Liza rubs me with embrocation every night, but it torments me cruel.'</p> 
<p>Mrs. Kemp then went into the house, and Liza remained talking to Mrs. Stanley, she, too, had to go in, and Liza was left alone. Some while she spent thinking of nothing, staring vacantly in front of her, enjoying the cool and quiet of the evening. But Liza could not be left alone long, several boys came along with a bat and a ball, and fixed upon the road just in front of her for their pitch. Taking off their coats they piled them up at the two ends, and were ready to begin.</p> 
<p>'I say, old gal,' said one of them to Liza, 'come an' have a gime of cricket, will yer?'</p> 
<p>'Na, Bob, I'm tired.'</p> 
<p>'Come on!'</p> 
<p>'Na, I tell you I won't.'</p> 
<p>'She was on the booze yesterday, an' she ain't got over it,' cried another boy.</p> 
<p>'I'll swipe yer over the snitch!' replied Liza to him, and then on being asked again, said:</p> 
<p>'Leave me alone, won't yer?'</p> 
<p>'Liza's got the needle ter-night, thet's flat,' commented a third member of the team.</p> 
<p>'I wouldn't drink if I was you, Liza,' added another, with mock gravity. 'It's a bad 'abit ter git into,' and he began rolling and swaying about like a drunken man.</p> 
<p>If Liza had been 'in form' she would have gone straight away and given the whole lot of them a sample of her strength; but she was only rather bored and vexed that they should disturb her quietness, so she let them talk. They saw she was not to be drawn, and leaving her, set to their game. She watched them for some time, but her thoughts gradually lost themselves, and insensibly her mind was filled with a burly form, and she was again thinking of Jim.</p> 
<p>''E is a good sort ter want ter tike me ter the ply,' she said to herself. 'Tom never arst me!'</p> 
<p>Jim had said he would come out in the evening; he ought to be here soon, she thought. Of course she wasn't going to the theatre with him, but she didn't mind talking to him; she rather enjoyed being asked to do a thing and refusing, and she would have liked another opportunity of doing so. But he didn't come and he had said he would!</p> 
<p>'I say, Bill,' she said at last to one of the boys who was fielding close beside her, 'that there Blakeston--d'you know 'im?'</p> 
<p>'Yes, rather; why, he works at the sime plice as me.'</p> 
<p>'Wot's 'e do with 'isself in the evening; I never see 'im abaht?'</p> 
<p>'I dunno. I see 'im this evenin' go into the "Red Lion". I suppose 'e's there, but I dunno.'</p> 
<p>Then he wasn't coming. Of course she had told him she was going to stay indoors, but he might have come all the same--just to see.</p> 
<p>'I know Tom 'ud 'ave come,' she said to herself, rather sulkily.</p> 
<p>'Liza! Liza!' she heard her mother's voice calling her.</p> 
<p>'Arright, I'm comin',' said Liza.</p> 
<p>'I've been witin' for you this last 'alf-hour ter rub me.'</p> 
<p>'Why didn't yer call?' asked Liza.</p> 
<p>'I did call. I've been callin' this last I dunno 'ow long; it's give me quite a sore throat.'</p> 
<p>'I never 'eard yer.'</p> 
<p>'Na, yer didn't want ter 'ear me, did yer? Yer don't mind if I dies with rheumatics, do yer? I know.'</p> 
<p>Liza did not answer, but took the bottle, and, pouring some of the liniment on her hand, began to rub it into Mrs. Kemp's rheumatic joints, while the invalid kept complaining and grumbling at everything Liza did.</p> 
<p>'Don't rub so 'ard, Liza, you'll rub all the skin off.'</p> 
<p>Then when Liza did it as gently as she could, she grumbled again.</p> 
<p>'If yer do it like thet, it won't do no good at all. You want ter sive yerself trouble--I know yer. When I was young girls didn't mind a little bit of 'ard work--but, law bless yer, you don't care abaht my rheumatics, do yer?'</p> 
<p>At last she finished, and Liza went to bed by her mother's side.</p> 
<p>第二天早晨，丽莎在赶着去工厂的路上，追上了萨莉。她们俩经过一天出外玩乐，都疲惫、零乱不堪，前刘海乱七八糟地披在脑门子上，后面的头发胡乱地打成了一个松散的发结，悬在颈根上，好象随时会散开来。丽莎没来得及把她的帽子戴上，就拎在手里。萨莉的帽子用别针别着，歪在半边；她得不断用力把它往头上揿牢，不让掉下来。</p> 
<p>即使灰姑娘也没有她们这样不成样子；灰姑娘衣衫尽管破烂，也打好补丁，穿得整整齐齐，而萨莉的破旧衣裳撕裂了一大片，丽莎的袜子卸到了鞋面上。</p> 
<p>“你好吗，萨莉！”丽莎赶上了她，招呼她。</p> 
<p>“唷，我今天早上头痛得厉害哪！”她说，转过一张苍白的脸来，眼睛底下显出深深的纹痕。</p> 
<p>“我也不太舒服，”丽莎有同感地说。</p> 
<p>“我不该喝了那么多啤酒，”萨莉头里一阵剧痛，又补充了一句。</p> 
<p>“哦，一会儿你就好了，”丽莎说。</p> 
<p>就在这时候，她们听见钟声敲响八点，她们赶紧奔跑，不要迟到了拿不到牌子，因而拿不到这一天的工资。她们拐进一条街，工厂在这条街的尽头处；只见六七十个女工象她们一样在拼命地奔，要赶在上班时间之前进厂门。</p> 
<p>整个上午，丽莎有气无力地干着活，头稍微动一动，就象一块铅受到一次电流冲击；舌头和嘴里又是发烧，又是干渴。</p> 
<p>总算午餐时间到来了。</p> 
<p>“来呀，萨莉，”丽莎说；“我要去喝一杯。我再也受不住了。”</p> 
<p>于是她们走进对面的小酒店，各人一杯啤酒，一口就喝完了。丽莎深深地舒了一口气。</p> 
<p>“这东西倒真给人提精神，是不是？’’</p> 
<p>“我刚才口干得要死。我没有告诉你吧，丽莎？一一‘他昨夜说出口了。”</p> 
<p>“你说什么？”</p> 
<p>“嗳，哈利嘛。他终于说出口了。”</p> 
<p>“叫你定日子吗？’’丽莎笑嘻嘻问。</p> 
<p>“是啊。”</p> 
<p>“那你定了吗？”</p> 
<p>“早先我不是说笑话吧！”萨莉加强了口气说。“我一直对你说的，我将比你先出嫁。’’</p> 
<p>“是啊！”丽莎想了想说。</p> 
<p>“我劝你，丽莎，你还是要汤姆好；他这人不坏。”她用着好象是保护人的口吻说。</p> 
<p>“我爱准，就要谁；这是我的事，不用别人管。”</p> 
<p>“好吧，丽莎，别恼火，我不是有意惹犯你。”</p> 
<p>“那你说这些干吗？”</p> 
<p>“哦，我看见你昨天跟他一起去郊游¨总以为你终究还是要他了。”</p> 
<p>“他要带我一起去，我可没叫他带我去。"</p> 
<p>“是啊，我也不是叫我的哈利带我去的。"</p> 
<p>“我从来没说过是你叫他的嘛。”</p> 
<p>“噢，你在闹别扭，准是！”萨莉气呼呼地说。</p> 
<p>啤酒使丽莎恢复了精神I她回到厂里工作．头也不痛了。昨天狂饮狂欢，这会儿除了还有点吃力之外，倒不觉得有什么不舒服。</p> 
<p>她一面干活，一面回想着昨天的一桩桩事情，只觉得她思想里始终纠缠着那个粗壮的人——吉姆·布莱克斯顿。她在头脑里看见他跟她并肩在森林中散步，看见他主持野餐、拉手风琴、唱歌、说笑话I最后她感觉到在马车回来的途中，她身旁那个高大的汉子，他的又粗又大的手握着她的手，同时汤姆的臂膀揽着她的腰。</p> 
<p>汤姆！他这才第一次出现在她的脑海里，但是随即又在那另一个人的旁边沉落了下去。</p> 
<p>最后她回忆起从小酒店散步回家、几次说“明天见”、吉姆赶上来的捷速的脚步、还有接吻。</p> 
<p>她一阵脸红，急忙看看有没有姑娘们瞧着她。她不禁想起他把她抱在怀里的那个时刻；她此刻还感觉到他的胡子覆在她嘴上的刺激。她的心似乎在胸窝里膨胀起来，她仰起头透口气，仿佛再次迎着他的嘴唇。</p> 
<p>想到这生动的情景，她周身哆嗦起来。</p> 
<p>“你怎么在发抖，丽莎？"一个姑娘问她。“你不冷吧？”</p> 
<p>“不冷．’’丽莎说着，她因为被人闯进了她的沉思默想的境界而羞赧。“怎么，我还在出汗——汗在淌下来。”</p> 
<p>“我当你准是在森林里着凉了，”那姑娘说。</p> 
<p>“我今天早晨上班来的时候看见你的男朋友，”另一个姑娘说。</p> 
<p>丽莎略微一愣。</p> 
<p>“我没有男朋友；你说谁？”</p> 
<p>“当然是你的汤姆口罗。他垂头丧气的。你昨天对他怎么样啦？”</p> 
<p>“我跟他没有关系，没有。’’</p> 
<p>“得了；别跟我来这一套。”</p> 
<p>铃声响了，姑娘们丢掉生活，一哄而出。她们三三两两在厂门口闲谈几句，各自分头回家去。丽莎和萨莉一起走。</p> 
<p>“总算下班了！”萨莉大声说，一边看着正在附近戏院上演的一出戏剧的广告。</p> 
<p>“那个戏我要去看！”丽莎和萨莉手挽手站在那引人注目的广告前面，这样说。</p> 
<p>广告上画着两间房间，中间一条走廊I一间房间里地板上躺着一个死人，另外有两个人非常惊慌地听着走廊里一个年轻人在敲门。</p> 
<p>“你瞧，他们把他杀了，”萨莉兴奋地说。</p> 
<p>“是啊，哪个笨蛋都看得出！问题是外面那个呢？他是干什么来着的？’’</p> 
<p>“他可漂亮哪！我要叫哈利带我去看，一定叫他带我去。这个戏我要看。他说了要带我去看的。”</p> 
<p>她们又往前走。丽莎和萨莉分了手，各自回家。</p> 
<p>丽莎知道必须经过吉姆家门口，只不知会不会看到他。可是她沿着小街走去的时候，看见汤姆正迎面走来。她突然一个念头想回避他，旋转身子退回去。后来她想这样做也愚蠢，便重新回转身来，朝着他走。</p> 
<p>她不知他会不会已经看到她，或者注意到了她在转去转来。但是当她向前看去的时候，他却不见了。他没有看到她，而且显然是跑进哪一幢房子去看他的朋友了。</p> 
<p>她加速脚步；在经过吉姆住的房子的时候，不由自主地看望一下。他正站在门口注视着她，嘴角上挂着微笑。</p> 
<p>“我没看见你，布莱克斯顿先生，”她看他走上前来，对他说。</p> 
<p>“你没有看见吗？嗯，我料到你会看见我的；我在等你朝这边看。我今天已经先见到过你。”</p> 
<p>“不；什么时候？”</p> 
<p>“我路上经过，看见你和另外一个姑娘在看那个戏剧广告。”</p> 
<p>“我可没有看见你。’’</p> 
<p>“没有，我知道你没有看见。我听见你说，你说，-那个戏我要去看。”’</p> 
<p>“是的，我是要去看。”</p> 
<p>“好吧，那我带你去。”</p> 
<p>“你？”</p> 
<p>“是啊；有什么不好？”</p> 
<p>“好是好，可是你老婆会说什么呢？”</p> 
<p>“她不会知道。”</p> 
<p>“可邻居会知道的！”</p> 
<p>“不，他们不会知道；没有人会看到我们。”</p> 
<p>他低声地说，不让人听到。</p> 
<p>“你可以在戏院外面跟我碰头，”他接着说。</p> 
<p>“不，我不能跟你一起去；你是个有了老婆的人。”</p> 
<p>“见鬼！那有什么关系——就去看看戏嘛？而且，我老婆要一起去也不行；她要管那些孩子。’’</p> 
<p>“我去是想去，”丽莎再三琢磨着说。</p> 
<p>他们到了她家门口，吉姆说——</p> 
<p>“嗳，今晚上你出来，告诉我你到底去不去——好吗，丽莎？”</p> 
<p>“不，我今晚上不出来。”</p> 
<p>“你出来一趟也不妨事嘛。反正我等你。”</p> 
<p>“你等也没用，因为我不会出来的。”</p> 
<p>“好，那么，这样吧，丽莎；这个星期六晚上是最后一场，我是无论如何要去的。如果你也去的话，那就六点半到戏院门口，我会在那里等着你的。好吗？”</p> 
<p>“不，我不去，”丽莎坚决地说，</p> 
<p>“不管怎么样，到时候我等你。”</p> 
<p>“我不会去的，所以你不必白等。”她说完就走进了屋里，把门砰的关上了。</p> 
<p>她母亲在外面打杂工，还没有回家；丽莎准备点心吃。她觉得一个人吃怪寂寞的，因此她倒了杯茶，里面加了一点炼乳，又切了一大块黄油面包，坐到了门口的石阶上。</p> 
<p>另外一个女人下楼来，看见丽莎，就在她旁边坐下，交谈起来。</p> 
<p>“怎么，斯坦利太太，你头上怎么啦？”丽莎看见她头上包着绷带，问她。</p> 
<p>“昨天夜里我不当心把头岸弄开了。”那女人回答，窘得脸涨得通红。</p> 
<p>“啊，真可怜！你怎么弄开的？”</p> 
<p>“我跌倒在煤斗上，把头撞开了。”</p> 
<p>“唷，幸亏我从没有过。’’</p> 
<p>“老实告诉你吧，丽莎，我跟我那老家伙吵了几句。不过我不喜欢这些事情传开去；你不会跟人家说吧，嗯？”</p> 
<p>“我决不会说！”丽莎答道。“想不到你丈夫是那样的。”</p> 
<p>“嗳，他清醒的时候可温柔哪——小绵羊般地温柔，”斯坦利太太辩解说。“但是，老天爷，他多喝了一点，就变了个魔鬼，竟然拿他没有办法。”</p> 
<p>“你不是结婚还没多久吗？”丽莎说。</p> 
<p>“没多久，还不过一年半；好不丢人？医院里医生就是这样对我说的。我只好到医院里去。你没有看见血流得可厉害哪！——满面都是血，血象炸开的自来水管那样直喷。这下我那老家伙可真害怕了；我对他说，‘我告你。’我虽然象屠宰场里的猪一样流着血，还是挥着拳头对他说，‘我告你一一不告你才怪！，而他说，‘不，’他说，‘别告我，看上帝份上，基蒂，我要吃三个月官司的。’</p> 
<p>“‘活该！’我说完，就往外跑。</p> 
<p>“可是，天哪．我没去告他！我知道他心眼儿不坏；他在清醒的时候象小绵羊一样温柔。”她说这话的时候，情意深长地微笑着。</p> 
<p>“那你后来怎么样？”丽莎问。</p> 
<p>“我吗．我对你说了，我跑到了医院里，医生对我说，．好女人，’他说，‘你好象伤得很厉害哪。’</p> 
<p>“我——我结婚还没一年半！</p> 
<p>“我把情况全都讲给医生听，他听了说，‘太大，’他直盯着我的眼睛说．‘太太，’他说，‘你一向喝酒吗？’</p> 
<p>“‘喝酒？’我说，‘不！我稍微呷过几口，至于你说一向喝酒吧，那——’我说，‘我确实不是个滴酒不进的人，我不是；我也喝杯啤酒，我喜欢。我不喝不行，我有那么多活要干，总得喝一点什么支持精神。可是，至于大喝呢，那，我可以这样说，整个伦敦找不到一个比我更清醒的女人。’</p> 
<p>“唉，我第一个丈夫才真是滴酒不进的。啊，我第一个丈夫真是个美男子，真是个美男子。”</p> 
<p>她终止了重复的话头，又对丽莎说——</p> 
<p>“他跟现在这个大不相同。他曾经过过好日子。他是个上等人！”她一个个字眼咬得着着实实，还表情十足地点点头。</p> 
<p>“他是个上等人，是个基督徒。他原先景况很好I他是个有教养的人，二十二年没碰过一口酒。”</p> 
<p>正说得起劲，来了丽莎的母亲。</p> 
<p>“晚上好，斯坦利太太，”她彬彬有礼地说。</p> 
<p>“你也好，肯普太太．”那个女人同样有礼貌地回答。</p> 
<p>“你的可怜的头怎么样？”丽莎的母亲同情地问。</p> 
<p>“噢，痛得要死。我不知怎么办。”</p> 
<p>“他这样对待你，该觉得可耻。”</p> 
<p>“噢，肯普太太，我对于他打我倒不怎么在乎．”斯坦利太太答道，“你不要以为我怨这个。我是气他对我说的话。我同任何女人一样受得起拳头。拳头我不放在心上，如果他不是无耻地趁我不宜动手的时候打我，我也能站起来狠狠揍他，而且不知多少次我把我第一个丈夫打得鼻青眼肿。可是现在这冤家骂我的那些下流话！听了羞死人，我听不惯这样对我说话。我第一个丈夫活着的时候，我景况好，他一个星期能挣两、三英镑哪。今天早晨我对他说，‘上等人怎么说得出这种话．我真不懂。’”</p> 
<p>“再好的丈夫也是莫名其妙的，”肯普太太警句式地说。“我不能尽在这儿夜晚的空气里呆着。"</p> 
<p>“近来你的风湿发作得怎么样？”</p> 
<p>“啊，可厉害哪。丽莎每夜替我搽药，还是痛得要命。”</p> 
<p>肯普太太回到了屋里去，丽莎继续跟斯坦利太太交谈着。后来斯坦利太太也回屋里去了，剩下丽莎一个人。</p> 
<p>她头脑里空空地站了一会，茫然望着前面，欣赏着夜晚的凉爽和静谧。</p> 
<p>然而丽莎不可能长久没人打扰她。几个男孩子拿着球板和球儿过来，拣中她面前的街面作球场。他们脱下外套，在两头堆起了球门，准备开场打球。</p> 
<p>“我说，好姑娘，”其中一个对丽莎说，“来跟我们一起玩一场板球，好吗？”</p> 
<p>“我不来，鲍勃，我很累。”</p> 
<p>“来吧！”</p> 
<p>“不来，我对你说不来嘛。”</p> 
<p>“她昨天喝醉了，还没有醒过来，”另一个孩子大声说。</p> 
<p>“我揍你！”丽莎对他说。</p> 
<p>他们再三叫她，她说——</p> 
<p>“别缠着我，好不好？”</p> 
<p>“丽莎在不开心，很明显，”球队里的另一个说。</p> 
<p>“如果我是你，我才不喝酒哩，”又一个孩子装着一本正经的样子加上一句。“喝上了酒不好，”说完，他摇摇晃晃做出醉鬼的样子。</p> 
<p>要是当时丽莎“竞技状态良好”的话，她早已冲出去，给他们大伙儿点颜色看看了；但她仅是厌烦他们打扰了她的安宁，所以让他们讲去。</p> 
<p>他们看看拉她不动，也就撇下她，自己去玩了。</p> 
<p>她观看了一会他们的游戏，渐渐神思恍惚，心中不知不觉让一个粗壮的人形盘踞着，她重又尽是想着吉姆。</p> 
<p>“他好，他要请我去看戏，”她心想。“汤姆从没有请过我！”</p> 
<p>吉姆刚才说，他晚上要出来的，她想这时候他该快来了。</p> 
<p>当然她不准备同他一起去看戏，不过她乐于跟他聊聊；她喜欢有人求她而又拒绝人家的请求，她希望再有机会重演一次。但是他不来，而他又明明说好要来的！</p> 
<p>“喂，比尔，”最后她对那一伙中的一个守外场的孩子说，“那边住的那个布莱克斯顿——你认识他吗？”</p> 
<p>“认识，当然认识；怎么，他是跟我在同一个地方做生活的。”</p> 
<p>“他今晚在干什么？我没看见他出来过。”</p> 
<p>“我不知道。我看见他今晚走进红狮酒店的。我想他大概在那里，不过我吃不准。’’</p> 
<p>那么，他是不来了。诚然她对他说过她今夜不出门的，可是他还是可以来——就来看看嘛。</p> 
<p>“我知道，换了汤姆，他会来的．”她抑郁地心里想。</p> 
<p>“丽莎！丽莎！”她听见她母亲的声音在叫她。</p> 
<p>“嗳，我来了，”丽莎说。</p> 
<p>“我这半个钟头一直等着你来替我搽药。’’</p> 
<p>“你干吗不叫我？”丽莎问。</p> 
<p>“我叫了。我不知叫了多长时间，喉咙都叫痛了。”</p> 
<p>“我一点没听见。’’</p> 
<p>“你不听见，你会要听见我吗？我害风湿死了，你也不管，你会管？我知道。”</p> 
<p>丽莎不吭声，只是拿出药瓶，在手上倒了些油膏，开始往肯普太太患风湿的关节上擦，那患者却尽是埋怨和责怪丽莎。</p> 
<p>“别擦得那么重，丽莎，你要把我的皮肤都擦下来了。”</p> 
<p>而丽莎尽量小心地轻轻给她擦时，她又责怪起来。</p> 
<p>“你要是这样擦法，一点用处也没有。你怕吃力——我知道你。在我年轻时候，姑娘们从来不怕出点力气——可是，天晓得，你却一点不顾我的风湿I你顾吗？”</p> 
<p>总算她唠叨完了。丽莎上床，在她母亲身旁睡下。</p>
