It did belong to the guy in the picture, Morton Lightower, and his family. The name rang a bell with Jacobi. "Isn't that the guy who owned that X/L Systems?"</p> 
<p>"No idea." I shook my head.</p> 
<p>"You know. The Internet honcho. Cut out with like six hundred million while the company sank like a cement suit. Stock used to sell for sixty bucks, now it's something like sixty cents."</p> 
<p>Suddenly I remembered seeing it on the news. "The Creed of Greed guy." He was trying to buy ball teams, gobbling up lavish homes, installing a $50,000 security gate on his place in Aspen, at the same time he was dumping his own stock and laying off half his staff.</p> 
<p>"I've heard of investor backlash," Jacobi said, shaking his head, "but this is a little much."</p> 
<p>Behind me, I heard a woman yelling to let her through the crowd. Inspector Paul Chin ushered her forward, through the web of news vans and camera crews. She stood in front of the bombed-out home.</p> 
<p>"Oh, my God," she gasped, a hand clasped over her mouth.</p> 
<p>Chin led her my way. "Lightower's sister," he said.</p> 
<p>She had her hair pulled back tightly, a cashmere sweater over jeans, and a pair of Manolo Blahnik flats I had once mooned over for about ten minutes in the window of Neiman's.</p> 
<p>"Please," I said, leading the unsteady woman over to an open black-and-white. "I'm Lieutenant Boxer, Homicide."</p> 
<p>"Dianne Aronoff," she muttered vacantly. "I heard it on the news. Mort? Charlotte? The kids...Did anyone make it out?"</p> 
<p>"We pulled out a boy, about eleven."</p> 
<p>"Eric," she said. "He's okay?"</p> 
<p>"He's at the Burn Unit at Cal Pacific. I think he's going to be all right."</p> 
<p>"Thank God!" she exclaimed. Then she covered her face again. "How can this be happening?"</p> 
<p>I knelt down in front of Dianne Aronoff and took her hand. I squeezed it gently. "Ms. Aronoff, I have to ask you some questions. This was no accident. Do you have any idea who could've targeted your brother?"</p> 
<p>"No accident," she repeated. "Mortie was saying, `The media treats me like bin Laden. No one understands. What I do is supposed to be about making money.' "</p> 
<p>Jacobi switched gears. "Ms. Aronoff, it looks like the explo-sion originated from the second floor. You have any idea who might've had access to the home?"</p> 
<p>"There was a housekeeper," she said, dabbing at her eyes. "Viola."</p> 
<p>Jacobi exhaled. "Unfortunately, that's probably the third body we found. Buried under the rubble."</p> 
<p>"Oh..." Dianne Aronoff choked a sob.</p> 
<p>I pressed her hand. "Look, Ms. Aronoff, I saw the explo-sion. That bomb was planted from inside. Someone was either let in or had access. I need you to think."</p> 
<p>"There was an au pair," she muttered. "I think she some-times spent the night."</p> 
<p>"Lucky for her." Jacobi rolled his eyes. "If she'd been in there with your nephew..."</p> 
<p>"Not for Eric." Dianne Aronoff shook her head. "For Caitlin."</p> 
<p>Jacobi and I looked at each other. "Who?"</p> 
<p>"Caitlin, Lieutenant. My niece."</p> 
<p>When she saw our blank faces, she froze.</p> 
<p>"When you said Eric was the only one brought out, I just assumed..."</p> 
<p>We continued to stare at each other. No one else had been found in the house.</p> 
<p>"Oh, my God, Detectives, she is only six months old."</p>
