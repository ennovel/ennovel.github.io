<p>We had about an hour. That was all we had before this grotesque, seemingly random murder became headlines around the world as the second killing in a vicious terror spree. I needed to know how Bengosian had died, and fast.</p> 
<p>The second call was to Tracchio. It was still before five</p> 
<p>A.M. The night duty officer patched me through. "It's Lindsay Boxer," I said. "You said to make sure you knew the minute something went on." "Yeah," I heard him grunt, fumbling around with the phone. "I'm at the Clift Hotel. I think we just found the motive for the Lightower bombing."</p> 
<p>I could visualize him bolting upright in his pajamas, knocking his glasses onto the floor. "One of those X/L part-ners finally come clean? It was money, wasn't it?"</p> 
<p>"No," I said, shaking my head, "war."</p> 
<p>After I hung up with the Chief, I looked around Bengo-sian's hotel room. No blood, no sign of a struggle. A half-filled champagne glass rested on the conference table. Another shattered, at Bengosian's feet. His suit jacket was thrown onto the couch. An open bottle of Roederer.</p> 
<p>"Get a description of who he came up with," I told Lor-raine Stafford, one of my Homicide inspectors. "They might have security cameras in the lobby if we're lucky. And let's try and track down how Bengosian spent the early part of his night."</p> 
<p>We have declared war, the note read, on the agents of greed and corruption....</p> 
<p>A chill went right through me. It was going to happen again.</p> 
<p>I knew that in the next few hours I had to find out every-thing I could about Bengosian and Hopewell Health Care. I had no idea what he had done to be murdered like this.</p> 
<p>I picked up the crumpled note.</p> 
<p>We will find you, no matter how large your house or powerful your lawyers. We are inside your homes, your workplaces.... Your war is not beyond, but here. It is with us.</p> 
<p>Who the hell are you, August Spies?</p>
