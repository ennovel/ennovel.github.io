Maybe it was the thought of the three dead people in the house, or all the cops and firemen charging around the accident scene. I stared at that knapsack, and my brain was shouting out that it was wrong - dead wrong. "Everyone get back!" I yelled again.</p> 
<p>I started toward the knapsack. I didn't know what I was going to do yet, but the area had to be cleared.</p> 
<p>"No way, LT." Jacobi reached for my arm. "You don't get to do this, Lindsay."</p> 
<p>I pulled away from him. "Get everyone out of here, Warren."</p> 
<p>"I may not outrank you, LT," Jacobi said, more impas-sioned this time, "but I've got fourteen more years on the force. I'm telling you, don't go near that bag."</p> 
<p>The fire captain rushed up, shouting into his handheld, "Possible explosive device. Move everybody back. Get Magi-takos from the Bomb Squad up here."</p> 
<p>Less than a minute later, Niko Magitakos, head of the city's bomb squad, and two professionals covered in heavy protective gear pushed past me, heading toward the red bag. Niko wheeled out a boxlike instrument, an X-ray scanner. A square armored truck, like a huge refrigerator, backed up ominously toward the spot.</p> 
<p>The tech with the X-ray scanner took a read on the knap-sack from three or four feet away. I was sure the bag was hot - or at least a leave-behind. I was praying, Don't let this blow.</p> 
<p>"Get the truck in here." Niko turned with a frown. "It looks hot."</p> 
<p>In the next minutes, reinforced steel curtains were pulled out of the truck and set up in a protective barrier. A tech wheeled in a claw and crept closer to the bag. If it was a bomb, it could go off any second.</p> 
<p>I found myself in no-man's-land, not wanting to move. A bead of sweat trickled down my cheek.</p> 
<p>The man with the claw lifted the backpack to transport it to the truck.</p> 
<p>Nothing happened.</p> 
<p>"I don't get any reading," the tech holding the electro-sensor said. "We're gonna go for a hand entry."</p> 
<p>They lifted the backpack into the protective truck as Niko knelt in front of it. With practiced hands, he opened the zip-pered back.</p> 
<p>"There's no charge," Niko said. "It's a fucking battery radio."</p> 
<p>There was a collective sigh. I pulled out of the crowd and ran to the bag. There was an ID tag on the strap, one of those plastic labels. I lifted the strap and read.</p> 
<p>BOOM! FUCKERS.</p> 
<p>I was right. It was a goddamn leave-behind. Inside the backpack, next to the standard clock radio, was a photo in a frame. A computer photo, printed on paper, from a digital camera. The face of a good-looking man, maybe forty.</p> 
<p>One of the charred bodies inside, I was pretty sure.</p> 
<p>MORTON LIGHTOWER, read the inscription, AN ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE.</p> 
<p>"LET THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE BE HEARD."</p> 
<p>A name was printed at the bottom. AUGUST SPIES.</p> 
<p>Jesus, this was an execution!</p> 
<p>My stomach turned.</p>
