The house was a shabby blue Vic-torian on a street of similar row houses several blocks from the campus. Two patrol cars had the street blocked off. A SWAT van pulled up alongside. I didn't know what to expect, but I wasn't taking any chances.</p> 
<p>We all donned protective vests under our police jackets. It was 11:45. The Berkeley PD had the house under surveil-lance. They said no one had left, but a black girl carrying a Cal-Berkeley bag had gone in thirty minutes before.</p> 
<p>"Let's go find a missing baby," I said to the guys.</p> 
<p>Jacobi, Cappy, and I crept behind a line of parked cars close to the front of the house. No sign of activity inside. We knew the place could be booby-trapped.</p> 
<p>Two inspectors sidled up to the front porch. A SWAT team guy waited with a ram in case we needed to break in. The</p> 
<p>scene was eerily quiet.</p> 
<p>I gave the nod. Let's go in.</p> 
<p>"Open up! San Francisco Police!" Cappy rapped heavily on the door.</p> 
<p>My eyes were peeled to the side windows for any sign of activity. They had already used a bomb. I was sure there'd be no hesitation to opening up with guns. But there was nothing.</p> 
<p>Suddenly, I heard footsteps approaching from inside, the sound of a lock being turned. As the door swung open, we trained our guns on whoever was behind it.</p> 
<p>The black girl in a Cal-Berkeley sweatshirt, whom the Berkeley cops had seen going in. One look at the SWAT team and she let out a startled scream.</p> 
<p>"Wendy Raymore?" Cappy barked, yanking her out of the doorway.</p> 
<p>The shocked girl could barely speak. Cappy threw her into the arms of a waiting SWAT team member. Trembling, she pointed to a staircase. "I think she's up there."</p> 
<p>The three of us pushed our way inside. Two upstairs bed-rooms were open and empty. No one inside. Down the hall, another door was closed.</p> 
<p>Cappy rapped at the door. "Wendy Raymore? San Fran-cisco Police!"</p> 
<p>There was no answer.</p> 
<p>The adrenaline was burning in my veins. Cappy looked at me and checked his gun. Jacobi readied himself. I nodded.</p> 
<p>Cappy kicked open the door. We moved in, leveling guns around the room.</p> 
<p>A girl in a T-shirt shot up in bed. She looked stunned, blinking sleep from her eyes. She started to shriek: "Oh, my</p> 
<p>God, what's going on?"</p> 
<p>"Wendy Raymore?" Cappy kept his gun on her.</p> 
<p>The girl's face was white with terror, eyes going back and forth.</p> 
<p>"Where's the baby?" Cappy shouted.</p> 
<p>This is all wrong! Fucking all wrong, I was thinking.</p> 
<p>The girl had long dark hair and a swarthy complexion. She looked nothing like the description Dianne Aronoff had given us. Or the picture on Wendy Raymore's student ID. Or the girl I saw hurrying away from the bombing. I thought I knew what had happened. This girl had probably lost her ID, or it had been stolen. But who had it now?</p> 
<p>I put down my gun. We were staring at a different girl.</p> 
<p>"This isn't the au pair," I said.</p>
