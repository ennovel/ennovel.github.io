I gasped as a flash of heat and debris nearly knocked me to the ground.</p> 
<p>I turned away and crouched down to shield Martha as the oven like shock waves from the explosion passed over us. A few seconds later, I turned to pull myself up. Mother of God...I couldn't believe my eyes. The town house I had just admired was now a shell. Fire ripped through the second floor.</p> 
<p>In that instant I realized that people could still be inside.</p> 
<p>I tied Martha to a lamppost. Flames gusted just fifty feet away. I ran across the street to the blazing home. The second floor was gone. Anyone up there didn't have a chance.</p> 
<p>I fumbled through my fanny pack for the cell phone. Frantically, I punched in 911. "This is Lieutenant Lindsay Boxer, San Francisco Police Department, Shield two-seven-two-one. There's been an explosion at the corner of Alhambra and Pierce. A residence. Casualties likely. Need full medical and fire support. Get them moving!"</p> 
<p>I cut off the dispatcher. Procedure told me to wait, but if anyone was in there, there was no time. I ripped off my sweatshirt and wrapped it loosely around my face. "Oh, Jesus Christ, Lindsay," I said, and held my breath.</p> 
<p>Then I pushed my way into the burning house.</p> 
<p>"Is anyone there?" I shouted, choking immediately on the gray, raspy smoke. The intense heat bit at my eyes and face, and it hurt just to peek out from the protective cloth. A wall of burning Sheetrock and plaster hung above me.</p> 
<p>"Police!" I shouted again. "Is anyone there?"</p> 
<p>The smoke felt like sharp razors slicing into my lungs. It was impossible to hear above the roar of the flames. I suddenly understood how people trapped in fires on high floors would leap to their death rather than bear the intolerable heat.</p> 
<p>I shielded my eyes, pushing my way through the billow-ing smoke. I hollered a last time, "Is anyone alive in here?"</p> 
<p>I couldn't go any farther. My eyebrows were singed. I real-ized I could die in there.</p> 
<p>I turned and headed for the light and cool that I knew were behind me. Suddenly, I spotted two shapes, the bodies of a woman and a man. Clearly dead, their clothes on fire.</p> 
<p>I stopped, feeling my stomach turn. But there was noth-ing I could do for them.</p> 
<p>Then I heard a muffled noise. I didn't know if it was real. I stopped, tried to listen above the rumble of the fire. I could hardly bear the pain of the blistering heat on my face.</p> 
<p>There it was again. It was real, all right.</p> 
<p>Someone was crying.</p>
