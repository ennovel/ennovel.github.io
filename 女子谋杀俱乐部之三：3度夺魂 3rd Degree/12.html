"Charlotte Lightower was pregnant."</p> 
<p>Claire was looking drawn and helpless in her orange sur-gical scrubs. "Two months. Poor woman probably didn't even know herself."</p> 
<p>I don't know why I found that so sad, but I did. Maybe it made the Lightowers seem like more of a family to me, humanized them.</p> 
<p>"I was hoping to catch up with you sometime today." Claire gave me a halfhearted smile. "Just didn't envision it like this."</p> 
<p>"Yeah." I smiled and wiped a tear from the corner of my eye.</p> 
<p>"I heard what you did," Claire said. She came over and gave me a hug. "That took a lot of guts, honey. Also, you are a dumb bunny, do you know that?"</p> 
<p>"There was a moment when I wasn't sure I was going to make it out, Claire. There was all this smoke. It was every-where. In my eyes, my lungs. I couldn't see for shit. I just took hold of that little boy and prayed."</p> 
<p>"You saw the light. It led you out?" Claire smiled.</p> 
<p>"No. Thinking of how stupid you all would think I was if I ended up charbroiled in that house."</p> 
<p>"Woulda put a bit of a damper on our margarita nights," she said, nodding.</p> 
<p>"Have I ever told you" - I lifted my head and smiled - "you have a way of putting everything in perspective."</p> 
<p>The Lightowers' remains were side by side on two gur-neys. Even at Christmas the morgue is a lonely place, but on that Sunday afternoon, with the techs gone home, graphic autopsy photos and medical alerts pinned to the antiseptic walls, and a grisly smell in the air, it was as grim as I could remember.</p> 
<p>I moved over to the bodies.</p> 
<p>"So, you called me down here," I said. "What did you want me to see?"</p> 
<p>"I called you down here," she said, " 'cause it occurred to me that you needed a good hug."</p> 
<p>"I did," I said, "but a killer medical revelation wouldn't hurt."</p> 
<p>Claire moved over to a table and started to take off her surgical gloves. "Killer medical revelation?" She rolled her eyes. "What could I possibly have for you, Lindsay. These three people, they were blown up."</p>
