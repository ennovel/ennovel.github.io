Finding the Lightower baby at McDonald's was one of those times. The entire Hall seemed to breathe a deep, grateful sigh of relief.</p> 
<p>I got Cindy on the line and asked a favor. She said she'd be delighted to put a little pressure on X/L.</p> 
<p>I hung up with Cindy, and Charlie Clapper was knocking on my door. "Nice bust, Boxer."</p> 
<p>"That's a little sexist, even from you," I said with a smile.</p> 
<p>Clapper laughed. His Crime Scene team had spent the better part of the past day and a half picking through the bomb site. Charlie looked exhausted.</p> 
<p>"FYEF, darlin'," he said, motioning with his head for me to follow. "For your eyes first. They're a whole lot cuter than Tracchio's."</p> 
<p>"Knew I earned this gold shield for something."</p> 
<p>Charlie took me to his office down the hall. Niko was in there, from the Bomb Squad, leaning back in Charlie's old hardwood recliner and picking something out of a Chinese food container.</p> 
<p>"Okay, we've pieced together an idea of the explosive device." Charlie threw out a chair for me. On a poster board, someone had drawn a floor plan of the Lightowers' town house. "Traces of C-4 were all over the place. Half a pound's enough to blow a jet from the sky, so from the size of the blast, I figure this was about five times that. Whoever did it put it inside something like this" - he took out a black Nike sport bag - "and placed it in one of the rooms."</p> 
<p>"How do we know that?" I asked.</p> 
<p>"Easy." Clapper grinned. He pulled out a fragment of black nylon with a Nike swoosh on it. "We found this plas-tered against the wall."</p> 
<p>"Any luck you could scrape a few prints off the bag?" I asked hopefully.</p> 
<p>"Sorry, honey," Clapper snickered, "this is the bag."</p> 
<p>"It was triggered by a fairly sophisticated device," Niko explained. "Remote detonation. Blasting cap was hooked up to a cell phone."</p> 
<p>"There's a market for C-4, Lindsay. We could look into any construction-site thefts, missing military inventory," said Charlie Clapper.</p> 
<p>"How are you with babies, Charlie?"</p> 
<p>"If they're eighteen or over," the CSU man said, grinning. "Why? You finally getting the itch?"</p> 
<p>If Clapper were a foot taller, fifty pounds lighter, and hadn't been married for thirty years, I just might take him up on his little flirtations one day. "Sorry, this one's a little younger."</p> 
<p>"You mean the Lightower baby?" Charlie scrunched his face.</p> 
<p>I nodded. "I want her dusted, Charlie. The kid, blanket, bassinet, anything you can find."</p> 
<p>"Been thirty years since I changed a diaper." Clapper let out a breath, looking a little squeamish. "Hey, I almost for-got...." He pulled out a coded evidence bag from under-neath a pile of papers on the desk. "There was a room down the hall from the nursery. Someone spent the night there. Someone who isn't accounted for now."</p> 
<p>The au pair, I was thinking.</p> 
<p>"Don't get excited," Charlie said, shrugging. "Everything was cinders. But we picked up this by the bed."</p> 
<p>He tossed me the plastic bag. Inside was a small, twisted canister about three inches long.</p> 
<p>I held it up. Didn't have the slightest idea what it was.</p> 
<p>"Everything must've melted." Clapper shrugged. He fumbled behind him through his jacket draped over the chair. He came out with something that looked similar.</p> 
<p>"Proventil, Lindsay." He took the cap off his own device and fit it neatly onto the one from the evidence bag. He pressed the mouthpiece twice. Two puffs shot out into the air.</p> 
<p>"Whoever slept in that bed had asthma."</p>
