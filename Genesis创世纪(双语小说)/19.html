<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And at nightfall the two angels came to Sodom; and Lot was seated at the way into the town: and when he saw them he got up and came before them, falling down on his face to the earth. 
<br>19:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 说 ， 我 主 阿 ， 请 你 们 到 仆 人 家 里 洗 洗 脚 ， 住 一 夜 ， 清 早 起 来 再 走 。 他 们 说 ， 不 ， 我 们 要 在 街 上 过 夜 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said, My masters, come now into your servant's house and take your rest there for the night, and let your feet be washed; and early in the morning you may go on your way. And they said, Not so, but we will take our night's rest in the street. 
<br>19:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 罗 得 切 切 地 请 他 们 ， 他 们 这 才 进 去 ， 到 他 屋 里 。 罗 得 为 他 们 预 备 筵 席 ， 烤 无 酵 饼 ， 他 们 就 吃 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But he made his request more strongly, so they went with him into his house; and he got food ready for them, and made unleavened bread, of which they took. 
<br>19:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 还 没 有 躺 下 ， 所 多 玛 城 里 各 处 的 人 ， 连 老 带 少 ， 都 来 围 住 那 房 子 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But before they had gone to bed, the men of the town, all the men of Sodom, came round the house, young and old, from every part of the town; 
<br>19:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 呼 叫 罗 得 说 ， 今 日 晚 上 到 你 这 里 来 的 人 在 哪 里 呢 ？ 把 他 们 带 出 来 ， 任 我 们 所 为 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And crying out to Lot, they said, Where are the men who came to your house this night? Send them out to us, so that we may take our pleasure with them. 
<br>19:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 罗 得 出 来 ， 把 门 关 上 ， 到 众 人 那 里 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Lot went out to them in the doorway, shutting the door after him. 
<br>19:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 说 ， 众 弟 兄 ， 请 你 们 不 要 作 这 恶 事 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said, My brothers, do not this evil. 
<br>19:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 有 两 个 女 儿 ， 还 是 处 女 ， 容 我 领 出 来 ， 任 凭 你 们 的 心 愿 而 行 。 只 是 这 两 个 人 既 然 到 我 舍 下 ， 不 要 向 他 们 作 什 么 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; See now, I have two unmarried daughters; I will send them out to you so that you may do to them whatever seems good to you: only do nothing to these men, for this is why they have come under the shade of my roof. 
<br>19:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 众 人 说 ， 退 去 吧 。 又 说 ， 这 个 人 来 寄 居 ， 还 想 要 作 官 哪 。 现 在 我 们 要 害 你 比 害 他 们 更 甚 。 众 人 就 向 前 拥 挤 罗 得 ， 要 攻 破 房 门 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And they said, Give way there. This one man, they said, came here from a strange country, and will he now be our judge? now we will do worse to you than to them; and pushing violently against Lot, they came near to get the door broken in. 
<br>19:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 只 是 那 二 人 伸 出 手 来 ， 将 罗 得 拉 进 屋 去 ， 把 门 关 上 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But the men put out their hands and took Lot into the house to them, shutting the door again. 
<br>19:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 并 且 使 门 外 的 人 ， 无 论 老 少 ， 眼 都 昏 迷 。 他 们 摸 来 摸 去 ， 总 寻 不 着 房 门 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But the men who were outside the door they made blind, all of them, small and great, so that they were tired out with looking for the door. 
<br>19:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 二 人 对 罗 得 说 ， 你 这 里 还 有 什 么 人 吗 ？ 无 论 是 女 婿 是 儿 女 ， 和 这 城 中 一 切 属 你 的 人 ， 你 都 要 将 他 们 从 这 地 方 带 出 去 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the men said to Lot, Are there any others of your family here? sons-in-law or sons or daughters, take them all out of this place; 
<br>19:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 们 要 毁 灭 这 地 方 。 因 为 城 内 罪 恶 的 声 音 在 耶 和 华 面 前 甚 大 ， 耶 和 华 差 我 们 来 ， 要 毁 灭 这 地 方 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For we are about to send destruction on this place, because a great outcry against them has come to the ears of the Lord; and the Lord has sent us to put an end to the town. 
<br>19:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 罗 得 就 出 去 ， 告 诉 娶 了 他 女 儿 的 女 婿 们 （ 娶 了 或 作 将 要 娶 ） 说 ， 你 们 起 来 离 开 这 地 方 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 要 毁 灭 这 城 。 他 女 婿 们 却 以 为 他 说 的 是 戏 言 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were married to his daughters, Come, let us go out of this place, for the Lord is about to send destruction on the town. But his sons-in-law did not take him seriously. 
<br>19:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 天 明 了 ， 天 使 催 逼 罗 得 说 ， 起 来 ， 带 着 你 的 妻 子 和 你 在 这 里 的 两 个 女 儿 出 去 ， 免 得 你 因 这 城 里 的 罪 恶 同 被 剿 灭 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when morning came, the angels did all in their power to make Lot go, saying, Get up quickly and take your wife and your two daughters who are here, and go, for fear that you come to destruction in the punishment of the town. 
<br>19:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 但 罗 得 迟 延 不 走 。 二 人 因 为 耶 和 华 怜 恤 罗 得 ， 就 拉 着 他 的 手 和 他 妻 子 的 手 ， 并 他 两 个 女 儿 的 手 ， 把 他 们 领 出 来 ， 安 置 在 城 外 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But while he was waiting, the men took him and his wife and his daughters by the hand, for the Lord had mercy on them, and put them outside the town. 
<br>19:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 领 他 们 出 来 以 后 ， 就 说 ， 逃 命 吧 。 不 可 回 头 看 ， 也 不 可 在 平 原 站 住 。 要 往 山 上 逃 跑 ， 免 得 你 被 剿 灭 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when they had put them out, he said, Go for your life, without looking back or waiting in the lowland; go quickly to the mountain or you will come to destruction. 
<br>19:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 罗 得 对 他 们 说 ， 我 主 阿 ， 不 要 如 此 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Lot said to them, Not so, O my Lord; 
<br>19:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 仆 人 已 经 在 你 眼 前 蒙 恩 。 你 又 向 我 显 出 莫 大 的 慈 爱 ， 救 我 的 性 命 。 我 不 能 逃 到 山 上 去 ， 恐 怕 这 灾 祸 临 到 我 ， 我 便 死 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; See now, your servant has had grace in your eyes and great is your mercy in keeping my life from destruction, but I am not able to get as far as the mountain before evil overtakes me and death; 
<br>19:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 看 哪 ， 这 座 城 又 小 又 近 ， 容 易 逃 到 ， 这 不 是 一 个 小 的 吗 ？ 求 你 容 我 逃 到 那 里 ， 我 的 性 命 就 得 存 活 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; This town, now, is near, and it is a little one: O, let me go there (is it not a little one?) so that my life may be safe. 
<br>19:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 天 使 对 他 说 ， 这 事 我 也 应 允 你 。 我 不 倾 覆 你 所 说 的 这 城 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said, See, I have given you your request in this one thing more: I will not send destruction on this town. 
<br>19:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 要 速 速 地 逃 到 那 城 。 因 为 你 还 没 有 到 那 里 ， 我 不 能 作 什 么 。 因 此 那 城 名 叫 琐 珥 （ 琐 珥 就 是 小 的 意 思 ） 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Go there quickly, for I am not able to do anything till you have come there. For this reason, the town was named Zoar. 
<br>19:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 罗 得 到 了 琐 珥 ， 日 头 已 经 出 来 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The sun was up when Lot came to Zoar. 
<br>19:24 [hgb]&nbsp; 当 时 ， 耶 和 华 将 硫 磺 与 火 从 天 上 耶 和 华 那 里 降 与 所 多 玛 和 蛾 摩 拉 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the Lord sent fire and flaming smoke raining down from heaven on Sodom and Gomorrah. 
<br>19:25 [hgb]&nbsp; 把 那 些 城 和 全 平 原 ， 并 城 里 所 有 的 居 民 ， 连 地 上 生 长 的 ， 都 毁 灭 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he sent destruction on those towns, with all the lowland and all the people of those towns and every green thing in the land. 
<br>19:26 [hgb]&nbsp; 罗 得 的 妻 子 在 后 边 回 头 一 看 ， 就 变 成 了 一 根 盐 柱 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But Lot's wife, looking back, became a pillar of salt. 
<br>19:27 [hgb]&nbsp; 亚 伯 拉 罕 清 早 起 来 ， 到 了 他 从 前 站 在 耶 和 华 面 前 的 地 方 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Abraham got up early in the morning and went to the place where he had been talking with the Lord: 
<br>19:28 [hgb]&nbsp; 向 所 多 玛 和 蛾 摩 拉 与 平 原 的 全 地 观 看 ， 不 料 ， 那 地 方 烟 气 上 腾 ， 如 同 烧 窑 一 般 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And looking in the direction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the lowland, he saw the smoke of the land going up like the smoke of an oven. 
<br>19:29 [hgb]&nbsp; 当 神 毁 灭 平 原 诸 城 的 时 候 ， 他 记 念 亚 伯 拉 罕 ， 正 在 倾 覆 罗 得 所 住 之 城 的 时 候 ， 就 打 发 罗 得 从 倾 覆 之 中 出 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So it came about that when God sent destruction on the towns of the lowland, he kept his word to Abraham, and sent Lot safely away when he put an end to the towns where he was living. 
<br>19:30 [hgb]&nbsp; 罗 得 因 为 怕 住 在 琐 珥 ， 就 同 他 两 个 女 儿 从 琐 珥 上 去 ， 住 在 山 里 。 他 和 两 个 女 儿 住 在 一 个 洞 里 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Lot went up out of Zoar to the mountain, and was living there with his two daughters, for fear kept him from living in Zoar: and he and his daughters made their living-place in a hole in the rock. 
<br>19:31 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 女 儿 对 小 女 儿 说 ， 我 们 的 父 亲 老 了 ， 地 上 又 无 人 按 着 世 上 的 常 规 进 到 我 们 这 里 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the older daughter said to her sister, Our father is old, and there is no man to be a husband to us in the natural way: 
<br>19:32 [hgb]&nbsp; 来 ， 我 们 可 以 叫 父 亲 喝 酒 ， 与 他 同 寝 。 这 样 ， 我 们 好 从 他 存 留 后 裔 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Come, let us give our father much wine, and we will go into his bed, so that we may have offspring by our father, 
<br>19:33 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 ， 那 夜 她 们 叫 父 亲 喝 酒 ， 大 女 儿 就 进 去 和 她 父 亲 同 寝 。 她 几 时 躺 下 ， 几 时 起 来 ， 父 亲 都 不 知 道 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And that night they made their father take much wine; and the older daughter went into his bed; and he had no knowledge of when she went in or when she went away. 
<br>19:34 [hgb]&nbsp; 第 二 天 ， 大 女 儿 对 小 女 儿 说 ， 我 昨 夜 与 父 亲 同 寝 。 今 夜 我 们 再 叫 他 喝 酒 ， 你 可 以 进 去 与 他 同 寝 。 这 样 ， 我 们 好 从 父 亲 存 留 后 裔 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And on the day after, the older daughter said to the younger, Last night I was with my father; let us make him take much wine this night again, and do you go to him, so that we may have offspring by our father. 
<br>19:35 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 ， 那 夜 她 们 又 叫 父 亲 喝 酒 ， 小 女 儿 起 来 与 她 父 亲 同 寝 。 她 几 时 躺 下 ， 几 时 起 来 ， 父 亲 都 不 知 道 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And that night again they made their father take much wine; and the younger daughter went into his bed; and he had no knowledge of when she went in or when she went away. 
<br>19:36 [hgb]&nbsp; 这 样 ， 罗 得 的 两 个 女 儿 都 从 她 父 亲 怀 了 孕 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And so the two daughters of Lot were with child by their father. 
<br>19:37 [hgb]&nbsp; 大 女 儿 生 了 儿 子 ， 给 他 起 名 叫 摩 押 ， 就 是 现 今 摩 押 人 的 始 祖 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the older daughter had a son, and she gave him the name Moab: he is the father of the Moabites to this day. 
<br>19:38 [hgb]&nbsp; 小 女 儿 也 生 了 儿 子 ， 给 他 起 名 叫 便 亚 米 ， 就 是 现 今 亚 扪 人 的 始 祖 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the younger had a son and gave him the name Ben-ammi: from him come the children of Ammon to this day.
