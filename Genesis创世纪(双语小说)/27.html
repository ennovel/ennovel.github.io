<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now when Isaac was old and his eyes had become clouded so that he was not able to see, he sent for Esau, his first son, and said to him, My son: and he said, Here am I. 
<br>27:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 说 ， 我 如 今 老 了 ， 不 知 道 哪 一 天 死 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said, See now, I am old, and my death may take place at any time: 
<br>27:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 现 在 拿 你 的 器 械 ， 就 是 箭 囊 和 弓 ， 往 田 野 去 为 我 打 猎 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So take your arrows and your bow and go out to the field and get meat for me; 
<br>27:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 照 我 所 爱 的 作 成 美 味 ， 拿 来 给 我 吃 ， 使 我 在 未 死 之 先 给 你 祝 福 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And make me food, good to the taste, such as is pleasing to me, and put it before me, so that I may have a meal and give you my blessing before death comes to me. 
<br>27:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 撒 对 他 儿 子 以 扫 说 话 ， 利 百 加 也 听 见 了 。 以 扫 往 田 野 去 打 猎 ， 要 得 野 味 带 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now Isaac's words to his son were said in Rebekah's hearing. Then Esau went out to get the meat. 
<br>27:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 利 百 加 就 对 她 儿 子 雅 各 说 ， 我 听 见 你 父 亲 对 你 哥 哥 以 扫 说 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Rebekah said to Jacob, her son, Your father said to your brother Esau in my hearing, 
<br>27:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 去 把 野 兽 带 来 ， 作 成 美 味 给 我 吃 ， 我 好 在 未 死 之 先 ， 在 耶 和 华 面 前 给 你 祝 福 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Go and get some roe's meat and make me a good meal, so that I may be full, and give you my blessing before the Lord before my death. 
<br>27:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 现 在 ， 我 儿 ， 你 要 照 着 我 所 吩 咐 你 的 ， 听 从 我 的 话 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now, my son, do what I say. 
<br>27:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 到 羊 群 里 去 ， 给 我 拿 两 只 肥 山 羊 羔 来 ， 我 便 照 你 父 亲 所 爱 的 给 他 作 成 美 味 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Go to the flock and get me two fat young goats; and I will make of them a meal to your father's taste: 
<br>27:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 拿 到 你 父 亲 那 里 给 他 吃 ， 使 他 在 未 死 之 先 给 你 祝 福 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And you will take it to him, so that he may have a good meal and give you his blessing before his death. 
<br>27:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 雅 各 对 他 母 亲 利 百 加 说 ， 我 哥 哥 以 扫 浑 身 是 有 毛 的 ， 我 身 上 是 光 滑 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Jacob said to Rebekah, his mother, But Esau my brother is covered with hair, while I am smooth: 
<br>27:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 倘 若 我 父 亲 摸 着 我 ， 必 以 我 为 欺 哄 人 的 ， 我 就 招 咒 诅 ， 不 得 祝 福 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; If by chance my father puts his hand on me, it will seem to him that I am tricking him, and he will put a curse on me in place of a blessing. 
<br>27:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 母 亲 对 他 说 ， 我 儿 ， 你 招 的 咒 诅 归 到 我 身 上 。 你 只 管 听 我 的 话 ， 去 把 羊 羔 给 我 拿 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And his mother said, Let the curse be on me, my son: only do as I say, and go and get them for me. 
<br>27:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 便 去 拿 来 ， 交 给 他 母 亲 。 他 母 亲 就 照 他 父 亲 所 爱 的 作 成 美 味 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So he went and got them and took them to his mother: and she made a meal to his father's taste. 
<br>27:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 利 百 加 又 把 家 里 所 存 大 儿 子 以 扫 上 好 的 衣 服 给 他 小 儿 子 雅 各 穿 上 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Rebekah took the fair robes of her oldest son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son: 
<br>27:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 又 用 山 羊 羔 皮 包 在 雅 各 的 手 上 和 颈 项 的 光 滑 处 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck: 
<br>27:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 就 把 所 作 的 美 味 和 饼 交 在 他 儿 子 雅 各 的 手 里 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And she gave into the hand of Jacob, her son, the meat and the bread which she had made ready. 
<br>27:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 雅 各 到 他 父 亲 那 里 说 ， 我 父 亲 。 他 说 ， 我 在 这 里 。 我 儿 ， 你 是 谁 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he came to his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I: who are you, my son? 
<br>27:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 雅 各 对 他 父 亲 说 ， 我 是 你 的 长 子 以 扫 。 我 已 照 你 所 吩 咐 我 的 行 了 。 请 起 来 坐 着 ， 吃 我 的 野 味 ， 好 给 我 祝 福 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Jacob said, I am Esau, your oldest son; I have done as you said: come now, be seated and take of my meat, so that you may give me a blessing. 
<br>27:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 撒 对 他 儿 子 说 ， 我 儿 ， 你 如 何 找 得 这 么 快 呢 ？ 他 说 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 你 的 神 使 我 遇 见 好 机 会 得 着 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Isaac said, How is it that you have got it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the Lord your God made it come my way. 
<br>27:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 撒 对 雅 各 说 ， 我 儿 ， 你 近 前 来 ， 我 摸 摸 你 ， 知 道 你 真 是 我 的 儿 子 以 扫 不 是 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Isaac said, Come near so that I may put my hand on you, my son, and see if you are truly my son Esau or not. 
<br>27:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 雅 各 就 挨 近 他 父 亲 以 撒 。 以 撒 摸 着 他 ， 说 ， 声 音 是 雅 各 的 声 音 ， 手 却 是 以 扫 的 手 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Jacob went near his father Isaac: and he put his hands on him; and he said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau. 
<br>27:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 撒 就 辨 不 出 他 来 。 因 为 他 手 上 有 毛 ， 像 他 哥 哥 以 扫 的 手 一 样 ， 就 给 他 祝 福 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he did not make out who he was, because his hands were covered with hair like his brother Esau's hands: so he gave him a blessing. 
<br>27:24 [hgb]&nbsp; 又 说 ， 你 真 是 我 儿 子 以 扫 吗 ？ 他 说 ， 我 是 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said, Are you truly my son Esau? And he said, I am. 
<br>27:25 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 撒 说 ， 你 递 给 我 ， 我 好 吃 我 儿 子 的 野 味 ， 给 你 祝 福 。 雅 各 就 递 给 他 ， 他 便 吃 了 ， 又 拿 酒 给 他 ， 他 也 喝 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said, Put it before me and I will take of my son's meat, so that I may give you a blessing. And he put it before him and he took it; and he gave him wine, and he had a drink. 
<br>27:26 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 父 亲 以 撒 对 他 说 ， 我 儿 ， 你 上 前 来 与 我 亲 嘴 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, my son, and give me a kiss. 
<br>27:27 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 就 上 前 与 父 亲 亲 嘴 。 他 父 亲 一 闻 他 衣 服 上 的 香 气 ， 就 给 他 祝 福 ， 说 ， 我 儿 的 香 气 如 同 耶 和 华 赐 福 之 田 地 的 香 气 一 样 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he came near and gave him a kiss; and smelling the smell of his clothing, he gave him a blessing, and said, See, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field on which the blessing of the Lord has come: 
<br>27:28 [hgb]&nbsp; 愿 神 赐 你 天 上 的 甘 露 ， 地 上 的 肥 土 ， 并 许 多 五 谷 新 酒 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; May God give you the dew of heaven, and the good things of the earth, and grain and wine in full measure: 
<br>27:29 [hgb]&nbsp; 愿 多 民 事 奉 你 ， 多 国 跪 拜 你 。 愿 你 作 你 弟 兄 的 主 。 你 母 亲 的 儿 子 向 你 跪 拜 。 凡 咒 诅 你 的 ， 愿 他 受 咒 诅 。 为 你 祝 福 的 ， 愿 他 蒙 福 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Let peoples be your servants, and nations go down before you: be lord over your brothers, and let your mother's sons go down before you: a curse be on everyone by whom you are cursed, and a blessing on those who give you a blessing. 
<br>27:30 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 撒 为 雅 各 祝 福 已 毕 ， 雅 各 从 他 父 亲 那 里 才 出 来 ， 他 哥 哥 以 扫 正 打 猎 回 来 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when Isaac had come to the end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob had not long gone away from Isaac his father, Esau came in from the field. 
<br>27:31 [hgb]&nbsp; 也 作 了 美 味 ， 拿 来 给 他 父 亲 ， 说 ， 请 父 亲 起 来 ， 吃 你 儿 子 的 野 味 ， 好 给 我 祝 福 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he made ready a meal, good to the taste, and took it to his father, and said to him, Let my father get up and take of his son's meat, so that you may give me a blessing. 
<br>27:32 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 父 亲 以 撒 对 他 说 ， 你 是 谁 ？ 他 说 ， 我 是 你 的 长 子 以 扫 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Isaac his father said to him, Who are you? And he said, I am your oldest son, Esau. 
<br>27:33 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 撒 就 大 大 地 战 兢 ， 说 ， 你 未 来 之 先 ， 是 谁 得 了 野 味 拿 来 给 我 呢 ？ 我 已 经 吃 了 ， 为 他 祝 福 。 他 将 来 也 必 蒙 福 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And in great fear Isaac said, Who then is he who got meat and put it before me, and I took it all before you came, and gave him a blessing, and his it will be? 
<br>27:34 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 扫 听 了 他 父 亲 的 话 ， 就 放 声 痛 哭 ， 说 ， 我 父 阿 ， 求 你 也 为 我 祝 福 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And hearing the words of his father, Esau gave a great and bitter cry, and said to his father, Give a blessing to me, even to me, O my father! 
<br>27:35 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 撒 说 ， 你 兄 弟 已 经 用 诡 计 来 将 你 的 福 分 夺 去 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said, Your brother came with deceit, and took away your blessing. 
<br>27:36 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 扫 说 ， 他 名 雅 各 ， 岂 不 是 正 对 吗 ？ 因 为 他 欺 骗 了 我 两 次 。 他 从 前 夺 了 我 长 子 的 名 分 ， 你 看 ， 他 现 在 又 夺 了 我 的 福 分 。 以 扫 又 说 ， 你 没 有 留 下 为 我 可 祝 的 福 吗 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said, Is it because he is named Jacob that he has twice taken my place? for he took away my birthright, and now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Have you not kept a blessing for me? 
<br>27:37 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 撒 回 答 以 扫 说 ， 我 已 立 他 为 你 的 主 ， 使 他 的 弟 兄 都 给 他 作 仆 人 ， 并 赐 他 五 谷 新 酒 可 以 养 生 。 我 儿 ， 现 在 我 还 能 为 你 作 什 么 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Isaac answering said, But I have made him your master, and have given him all his brothers for servants; I have made him strong with grain and wine: what then am I to do for you, my son? 
<br>27:38 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 扫 对 他 父 亲 说 ， 父 阿 ， 你 只 有 一 样 可 祝 的 福 吗 ？ 我 父 阿 ， 求 你 也 为 我 祝 福 。 以 扫 就 放 声 而 哭 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Esau said to his father, Is that the only blessing you have, my father? give a blessing to me, even me! And Esau was overcome with weeping. 
<br>27:39 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 父 亲 以 撒 说 ， 地 上 的 肥 土 必 为 你 所 住 。 天 上 的 甘 露 必 为 你 所 得 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Isaac his father made answer and said to him, Far from the fertile places of the earth, and far from the dew of heaven on high will your living-place be: 
<br>27:40 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 必 倚 靠 刀 剑 度 日 ， 又 必 事 奉 你 的 兄 弟 。 到 你 强 盛 的 时 候 ， 必 从 你 颈 项 上 挣 开 他 的 轭 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; By your sword will you get your living and you will be your brother's servant; but when your power is increased his yoke will be broken from off your neck. 
<br>27:41 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 扫 因 他 父 亲 给 雅 各 祝 的 福 ， 就 怨 恨 雅 各 ， 心 里 说 ， 为 我 父 亲 居 丧 的 日 子 近 了 ， 到 那 时 候 ， 我 要 杀 我 的 兄 弟 雅 各 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So Esau was full of hate for Jacob because of his father's blessing; and he said in his heart, The days of weeping for my father are near; then I will put my brother Jacob to death. 
<br>27:42 [hgb]&nbsp; 有 人 把 利 百 加 大 儿 子 以 扫 的 话 告 诉 利 百 加 ， 她 就 打 发 人 去 ， 叫 了 她 小 儿 子 雅 各 来 ， 对 他 说 ， 你 哥 哥 以 扫 想 要 杀 你 ， 报 仇 雪 恨 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Rebekah, hearing what Esau had said, sent for Jacob, her younger son, and said to him, It seems that your brother Esau is purposing to put you to death. 
<br>27:43 [hgb]&nbsp; 现 在 ， 我 儿 ， 你 要 听 我 的 话 ， 起 来 ， 逃 往 哈 兰 ， 我 哥 哥 拉 班 那 里 去 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So now, my son, do what I say: go quickly to Haran, to my brother Laban; 
<br>27:44 [hgb]&nbsp; 同 他 住 些 日 子 ， 直 等 你 哥 哥 的 怒 气 消 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And be there with him for a little time, till your brother's wrath is turned away; 
<br>27:45 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 哥 哥 向 你 消 了 怒 气 ， 忘 了 你 向 他 所 作 的 事 ， 我 便 打 发 人 去 把 你 从 那 里 带 回 来 。 为 什 么 一 日 丧 你 们 二 人 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Till the memory of what you have done to him is past and he is no longer angry: then I will send word for you to come back; are the two of you to be taken from me in one day? 
<br>27:46 [hgb]&nbsp; 利 百 加 对 以 撒 说 ， 我 因 这 赫 人 的 女 子 连 性 命 都 厌 烦 了 。 倘 若 雅 各 也 娶 赫 人 的 女 子 为 妻 ， 像 这 些 一 样 ， 我 活 着 还 有 什 么 益 处 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?
