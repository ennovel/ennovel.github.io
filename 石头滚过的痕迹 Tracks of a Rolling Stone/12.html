He was attached to the Vienna Embassy,where his uncle, Lord Ponsonby, was then ambassador. Shortlybefore this there had been serious insurrections both inParis, Vienna, and Berlin.</p> 
<p>　　Many may still be living who remember how Louis Philippe fledto England; how the infection spread over this country; how25,000 Chartists met on Kennington Common; how the upper andmiddle classes of London were enrolled as special constables,with the future Emperor of the French amongst them; how thepromptitude of the Iron Duke saved London, at least, from thefate of the French and Austrian capitals.</p> 
<p>　　This, however, was not till the following spring. Up toOctober, no overt defiance of the Austrian Government had yetasserted itself; but the imminence of an outbreak was theanxious thought of the hour. The hot heads of Germany,France, and England were more than meditating - they werethreatening, and preparing for, a European revolution.</p> 
<p>　　Bloody battles were to be fought; kings and emperors were tobe dethroned and decapitated; mobs were to take the place ofparliaments; the leaders of the 'people' - I.E. the stumporators - were to rule the world; property was to be dividedand subdivided down to the shirt on a man's - a rich man's -back; and every 'po'r' man was to have his own, and -somebody else's. This was the divine law of Nature,according to the gospels of Saint Jean Jacques and Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Feargus O'Connor. We were all naked under our clothes, whichclearly proved our equality. This was the simple, thebeautiful programme; once carried out, peace, fraternal andeternal peace, would reign - till it ended, and the earthlyParadise would be an accomplished fact.</p> 
<p>　　I was an ultra-Radical - a younger-son Radical - in thosedays. I was quite ready to share with my elder brother; Ihad no prejudice in favour of my superiors; I had oftendreamed of becoming a leader of the 'people' - a stumporator, I.E. - with the handsome emoluments of ministerialoffice.</p> 
<p>　　William Grey came to say good-bye. He was suddenly recalledin consequence of the insurrection. 'It is a most criticalstate of affairs,' he said. 'A revolution may break out allover the Continent at any moment. There's no saying where itmay end. We are on the eve of a new epoch in the history ofEurope. I wouldn't miss it on any account.'</p> 
<p>　　'Most interesting! most interesting!' I exclaimed. 'How Iwish I were going with you!'</p> 
<p>　　'Come,' said he, with engaging brevity.</p> 
<p>　　'How can I? I'm just going back to Cambridge.'</p> 
<p>　　'You are of age, aren't you?'</p> 
<p>　　I nodded.</p> 
<p>　　'And your own master? Come; you'll never have such a chanceagain.'</p> 
<p>　　'When do you start?'</p> 
<p>　　'To-morrow morning early.'</p> 
<p>　　'But it is too late to get a passport.'</p> 
<p>　　'Not a bit of it. I have to go to the Foreign Office for mydespatches. Dine with me to-night at my mother's - nobodyelse - and I'll bring your passport in my pocket.'</p> 
<p>　　'So be it, then. Billy Whistle [the irreverend nickname weundergraduates gave the Master of Trinity] will rusticate meto a certainty. It can't be helped. The cause is sacred.</p> 
<p>　　I'll meet you at Lady Grey's to-night.'</p> 
<p>　　We reached our destination at daylight on October 9. We hadalready heard, while changing carriages at Breslau station,that the revolution had broken out at Vienna, that the railswere torn up, the Bahn-hof burnt, the military defeated anddriven from the town. William Grey's official papers, aidedby his fluent German, enabled us to pass the barriers, andfind our way into the city. He went straight to the Embassy,and sent me on to the 'Erzherzog Carl' in the Karnthner ThorStrasse, at that time the best hotel in Vienna. It beingstill nearly dark, candles were burning in every window byorder of the insurgents.</p> 
<p>　　The preceding day had been an eventful one. Theproletariats, headed by the students, had sacked the arsenal,the troops having made but slight resistance. They thenmarched to the War Office and demanded the person of the WarMinister, Count Latour, who was most unpopular on account ofhis known appeal to Jellachich, the Ban of Croatia, toassist, if required, in putting down the disturbances. Somesharp fighting here took place. The rioters defeated thesmall body of soldiers on the spot, captured two guns, andtook possession of the building. The unfortunate ministerwas found in one of the upper garrets of the palace. Theruffians dragged him from his place of concealment, andbarbarously murdered him. They then flung his body from thewindow, and in a few minutes it was hanging from a lamp-postabove the heads of the infuriated and yelling mob.</p> 
<p>　　In 1848 the inner city of Vienna was enclosed within a broadand lofty bastion, fosse, and glacis. These were levelled in1857. As soon as the troops were expelled, cannon wereplaced on the Bastei so as to command the approaches fromwithout. The tunnelled gateways were built up, andbarricades erected across every principal thoroughfare.</p> 
<p>　　Immediately after these events Ferdinand I. abdicated infavour of the present Emperor Francis Joseph, who retiredwith the Court to Schobrunn. Foreigners at once took flight,and the hotels were emptied. The only person left in the'Archduke Charles' beside myself was Mr. Bowen, afterwardsSir George, Governor of New Zealand, with whom I was glad tofraternise.</p> 
<p>　　These humble pages do not aspire to the dignity of History;but a few words as to what took place are needful for thewriter's purposes. The garrison in Vienna had beencomparatively small; and as the National Guard had joined thestudents and proletariats, it was deemed advisable by theGovernment to await the arrival of reinforcements underPrince Windischgratz, who, together with a strong body ofServians and Croats under Jellachich, might overawe theinsurgents; or, if not, recapture the city withoutunnecessary bloodshed. The rebels were buoyed up by hopes ofsupport from the Hungarians under Kossuth. But in this theywere disappointed. In less than three weeks from the day ofthe outbreak the city was beleaguered. Fighting beganoutside the town on the 24th. On the 25th the soldiersoccupied the Wieden and Nussdorf suburbs. Next day theGemeinderath (Municipal Council) sent a PARLEMENTAR to treatwith Windischgratz. The terms were rejected, and the citywas taken by storm on October 30.</p> 
<p>　　A few days before the bombardment, the Austrian commandergave the usual notice to the Ambassadors to quit the town.</p> 
<p>　　This they accordingly did. Before leaving, Lord Ponsonbykindly sent his private secretary, Mr. George Samuel, to warnme and invite me to join him at Schonbrunn. I politelyelected to stay and take my chance. After the attack on thesuburbs began I had reason to regret the decision. Thehotels were entered by patrols, and all efficient waitersKOMMANDIERE'D to work at the barricades, or carry arms. Onthe fourth day I settled to change sides. The constantbanging of big guns, and rattle of musketry, with theimpossibility of getting either air or exercise without therisk of being indefinitely deprived of both, was becomingless amusing than I had counted on. I was already providedwith a PASSIERSCHEIN, which franked me inside the town, andup to the insurgents' outposts. The difficulty was how tocross the neutral ground and the two opposing lines. Broaddaylight was the safest time for the purpose; the officioussentry is not then so apt to shoot his friend. With muchstalking and dodging I made a bolt; and, notwithstandingviolent gesticulations and threats, got myself safely seizedand hurried before the nearest commanding officer.</p> 
<p>　　He happened to be a general or a colonel. He was a fiercelooking, stout old gentleman with a very red face, all theredder for his huge white moustache and well-filled whiteuniform. He began by fuming and blustering as if about toorder me to summary execution. He spoke so fast, it was noteasy to follow him. Probably my amateur German was aspuzzling to him. The PASSIERSCHEIN, which I produced, wasnot in my favour; unfortunately I had forgotten my ForeignOffice passport. What further added to his suspicion was hisinability to comprehend why I had not availed myself of thenotice, duly given to all foreigners, to leave the citybefore active hostilities began. How anyone, who had thechoice, could be fool enough to stay and be shelled orbayoneted, was (from his point of view) no proof ofrespectability. I assured him he was mistaken if he thoughtI had a predilection for either of these alternatives.</p> 
<p>　　'It was just because I desired to avoid both that I hadsought, not without risk, the protection I was so sure offinding at the hands of a great and gallant soldier.'</p> 
<p>　　'Dummes Zeug! dummes Zeug!' (stuff o' nonsense), he puffed.</p> 
<p>　　But a peppery man's good humour is often as near the surfaceas his bad. I detected a pleasant sparkle in his eye.</p> 
<p>　　'Pardon me, Excellenz,' said I, 'my presence here is the bestproof of my sincerity.'</p> 
<p>　　'That,' said he sharply, 'is what every rascal might pleadwhen caught with a rebel's pass in his pocket. Geleitsbriefefur Schurken sind Steckbriefe fur die Gerechtigkeit.' (Safe-conduct passes for knaves are writs of capias to honest men.)I answered: 'But an English gentleman is not a knave; and noone knows the difference better than your Excellenz.' Theterm 'Schurken' (knaves) had stirred my fire; and though Imade a deferential bow, I looked as indignant as I felt.</p> 
<p>　　'Well, well,' he said pacifically, 'you may go about yourbusiness. But SEHEN SIE, young man, take my advice, don'tsatisfy your curiosity at the cost of a broken head. Dazugehoren Kerle die eigens geschaffen sind.' As much as tosay: 'Leave halters to those who are born to be hanged.'</p> 
<p>　　Indeed, the old fellow looked as if he had enjoyed life toowell to appreciate parting with it gratuitously.</p> 
<p>　　I had nothing with me save the clothes on my back. When Ishould again have access to the 'Erzherzcg Carl' wasimpossible to surmise. The only decent inn I knew of outsidethe walls was the 'Golden Lamm,' on the suburb side of theDonau Canal, close to the Ferdinand bridge which faces theRothen Thurm Thor. Here I entered, and found it occupied bya company of Nassau JAGERS. A barricade was thrown up acrossthe street leading to the bridge. Behind it were two guns.</p> 
<p>　　One end of the barricade abutted on the 'Golden Lamm.' Withthe exception of the soldiers, the inn seemed to be deserted;and I wanted both food and lodging. The upper floor was fullof JAGERS. The front windows over-looked the Bastei. Thesewere now blocked with mattresses, to protect the men frombullets. The distance from the ramparts was not more than150 yards, and woe to the student or the fat grocer, in hisNational Guard uniform, who showed his head above the walls.</p> 
<p>　　While I was in the attics a gun above the city gate fired atthe battery below. I ran down a few minutes later to see theresult. One artilleryman had been killed. He was alreadylaid under the gun-carriage, his head covered with a cloak.</p> 
<p>　　The storming took place a day or two afterwards. One of theprincipal points of resistance had been at the bottom of theJagerzeile. The insurgents had a battery of several gunshere; and the handsome houses at the corners facing thePrater had been loop-holed and filled with students. Iwalked round the town after all was over, and was especiallyimpressed with the horrors I witnessed. The beautifulhouses, with their gorgeous furniture, were a mass of smokingruins. Not a soul was to be seen, not even a prowling thief.</p> 
<p>　　I picked my way into one or two of them without hindrance.</p> 
<p>　　Here and there were a heap of bodies, some burnt to cinders,some with their clothes still smouldering. The smell of theroasted flesh was a disgusting association for a long time tocome. But the whole was sickening to look at, and still moreso, if possible, to reflect upon; for this was the pricewhich so often has been, so often will be, paid for thealluring dream of liberty, and for the pursuit of thatmischievous will-o'-the-wisp - jealous Equality.</p>
