Sleep was out of the question. The night wasbright and frosty; and there was not heat enough in my bodyto dry my flannel shirt. I made shift to pull up some briarbushes; and, piling them round me as a screen, got somelittle shelter from the light breeze. For hours I laywatching Alpha Centauri - the double star of the Great Bear'spointers - dipping under the Polar star like the hour hand ofa clock. My thoughts, strange to say, ran little on themorrow; they dwelt almost solely upon William Nelson. Howfar was I responsible, to what extent to blame, for leadinghim, against his will, to death? I re-enacted the wholeevent. Again he was in my hands, still breathing when I lethim go, knowing, as I did so, that the deed consigned himliving to his grave. In this way I passed the night.</p> 
<p>　　Just as the first streaks of the longed-for dawn broke in theEast, I heard distant cries which sounded like the whoops ofIndians. Then they ceased, but presently began again muchnearer than before. There was no mistake about them now, -they were the yappings of a pack of wolves, clearly enough,upon our track of yesterday. A few minutes more, and thelight, though still dim, revealed their presence coming on atfull gallop. In vain I sought for stick or stone. Even theriver, though I took to it, would not save me if they meantmischief. When they saw me they slackened their pace. I didnot move. They then halted, and forming a half-moon somethirty yards off, squatted on their haunches, and began atintervals to throw up their heads and howl.</p> 
<p>　　My chief hope was in the coming daylight. They were lesslikely to attack a man then than in the dark. I had oftenmet one or two together when hunting; these had alwaysbolted. But I had never seen a pack before; and I knew apack meant that they were after food. All depended on theirhunger.</p> 
<p>　　When I kept still they got up, advanced a yard or two, thenrepeated their former game. Every minute the light grewstronger; its warmer tints heralded the rising sun. Seeing,however, that my passivity encouraged them, and convincedthat a single step in retreat would bring the pack upon me, Idetermined in a moment of inspiration to run amuck, and trustto Providence for the consequences. Flinging my arms wildlyinto the air, and frantically yelling with all my lungs, Idashed straight in for the lot of them. They were, as Iexpected, taken by surprise. They jumped to their feet andturned tail, but again stopped - this time farther off, andhowled with vexation at having to wait till their preysuccumbed.</p> 
<p>　　The sun rose. Samson was on the move. I shouted to him, andhe to me. Finding me thus reinforced the enemy slunk off,and I was not sorry to see the last of my ugly foes. I nowrepeated my instructions about our trysting place, waitedpatiently till Samson had breakfasted (which he did with themost exasperating deliberation), saw him saddle my horse andleave his camp. I then started upon my travels up the river,to meet him. After a mile or so, the high ground on bothbanks obliged us to make some little detour. We then lostsight of each other; nor was he to be seen when I reached theappointed spot.</p> 
<p>　　Long before I did so I began to feel the effects of mylabours. My naked feet were in a terrible state from thecactus thorns, which I had been unable to avoid in the dark;occasional stones, too, had bruised and made them verytender. Unable to shuffle on at more than two miles an hourat fastest, the happy thought occurred to me of tearing up myshirt and binding a half round each foot. This enabled me toget on much better; but when the September sun was high, myunprotected skin and head paid the penalty. I waited for acouple of hours, I dare say, hoping Samson would appear. Butconcluding at length that he had arrived long before me,through the slowness of my early progress, and had gonefurther up the river - thinking perhaps that I had meant someother place - I gave him up; and, full of internal 'd-n' athis incorrigible consistency, plodded on and on for - I knewnot where.</p> 
<p>　　Why, it may be asked, did I not try to cross where I hadintended? I must confess my want of courage. True, theriver here was not half, not a third, of the width of thescene of my disasters; but I was weak in body and in mind.</p> 
<p>　　Had anything human been on the other side to see me - to seehow brave I was, (alas! poor human nature!) - I could haveplucked up heart to risk it. It would have been such acomfort to have some one to see me drown! But it isdifficult to play the hero with no spectators save oneself.</p> 
<p>　　I shall always have a fellow-feeling with the Last Man:</p> 
<p>　　practically, my position was about as uncomfortable as hiswill be.</p> 
<p>　　One of the worst features of it was, what we so oftensuffered from before - the inaccessibility of water. The sunwas broiling, and the and soil reflected its scorching rays.</p> 
<p>　　I was feverish from exhaustion, and there was nothing,nothing to look forward to. Mile after mile I crawled along,sometimes half disposed to turn back, and try the deep butnarrow passage; then that inexhaustible fountain of lasthopes - the Unknown - tempted me to go forward. Ipersevered; when behold! as I passed a rock, an Indian stoodbefore me.</p> 
<p>　　He was as naked as I was. Over his shoulder he carried aspear as long as a salmon rod. Though neither had foreseenthe other, he was absolutely unmoved, showed no surprise, nocuriosity, no concern. He stood still, and let me come up tohim. My only, or rather my uppermost, feeling was gladness.</p> 
<p>　　Of course the thought crossed me of what he might do if heowed the white skins a grudge. If any white man had everharmed one of his tribe, I was at his mercy; and it wascertain that he would show me none. He was a tall powerfulman, and in my then condition he could have done what hepleased with me. Friday was my model; the red man wasRobinson Crusoe. I kneeled at his feet, and touched theground with my forehead. He did not seem the least elated bymy humility: there was not a spark of vanity in him.</p> 
<p>　　Indeed, except for its hideousness and brutality, his facewas without expression.</p> 
<p>　　I now proceeded to make a drawing, with my finger, in thesand, of a mule in the water; while I imitated by pantomimethe struggles of the drowning. I then pointed to myself;and, using my arms as in swimming, shook my head and myfinger to signify that I could not swim. I worked animaginary paddle, and made him understand that I wanted himto paddle me across the river. Still he remained unmoved;till finally I used one argument which interested him morethan all the rest of my story. I untied a part of the shirtround one foot and showed him three gold studs. These I tookout and gave to him. I also made a drawing of a rifle in thesand, and signified that he would get the like if he wentwith me to my camp. Whereupon he turned in the direction Iwas going; and, though unbidden by a look, I did not hesitateto follow.</p> 
<p>　　I thought I must have dropped before we reached his village.</p> 
<p>　　This was an osier-bed at the water's side, where the wholeriver rushed through a rocky gorge not more than fifty tosixty yards broad. There were perhaps nearly a hundredIndians here, two-thirds of whom were women and children.</p> 
<p>　　Their habitations were formed by interlacing the tops of theosiers. Dogs' skins spread upon the ground and numeroussalmon spears were their only furniture. In a few minutes myarrival created a prodigious commotion. The whole populationturned out to stare at me. The children ran into the bushesto hide. But feminine curiosity conquered feminine timidity.</p> 
<p>　　Although I was in the plight of the forlorn Odysseus afterhis desperate swim, I had no 'blooming foliage' to wind[Greek text which cannot be reproduced]. Unlike thePhaeacian maidens, however, the tawny nymphs were all asbrave as Princess Nausicaa herself. They stared, andpointed, and buzzed, and giggled, and even touched my skinwith the tips of their fingers - to see, I suppose, if thewhite would come off.</p> 
<p>　　But ravenous hunger turned up its nose at flirtation. Thefillets of drying salmon suspended from every bough were amillion times more seductive than the dark Naiads who haddressed them. Slice after slice I tore down and devoured, asthough my maw were as compendious as Jack the Giant Killer's.</p> 
<p>　　This so astonished and delighted the young women that theykept supplying me, - with the expectation, perhaps, thatsooner or later I must share the giant's fate.</p> 
<p>　　While this was going on, a conference was being held; and Ihad the satisfaction of seeing some men pull up a lot of deadrushes, dexterously tie them into bundles, and truss thesetogether by means of spears. They had no canoes, for thevery children were amphibious, living, so it seemed, as muchin the water as out of it. When the raft was completed, Iwas invited to embark. My original friend, who had twisted atow-rope, took this between his teeth, and led the way.</p> 
<p>　　Others swam behind and beside me to push and to pull. Theforce of the water was terrific; but they seemed to care nomore for that than fish. My weight sunk the rush bundles agood bit below the surface; and to try my nerves, my crewevery now and then with a wild yell dived simultaneously,dragging the raft and me under water. But I sat tight; andwith genuine friendliness they landed me safely on thedesired shore.</p> 
<p>　　It was quite dark before we set forth. Robinson Crusoewalked on as if he knew exactly where my camp was. Probablythe whole catastrophe had by this time been bruited for milesabove and below the spot. Five other stalwart young fellowskept us company, each with salmon spear in hand. The walkseemed interminable; but I had shipped a goodly cargo oflatent energy.</p> 
<p>　　When I got home, instead of Samson, I found the camp occupiedby half a dozen Indians. They were squatted round a fire,smoking. Each one, so it seemed, had appropriated somearticle of our goods. Our blankets were over theirshoulders. One had William's long rifle in his lap. Anotherwas sitting upon mine. A few words were exchanged with thenewcomers, who seated themselves beside their friends; but nomore notice was taken of me than of the mules which wereeating rushes close to us. How was I, single-handed, toregain possession? That was the burning question. Adiplomatic course commanded itself as the only possible one.</p> 
<p>　　There were six men who expected rewards, but the wherewithalwas held in seisin by other six. The fight, if there wereone, should be between the two parties. I would hope toprove, that when thieves fall out honest men come by theirown.</p> 
<p>　　There is one adage whose truth I needed no further proof of.</p> 
<p>　　Its first line apostrophises the 'Gods and little fishes.'</p> 
<p>　　My chief need was for the garment which completes the rhyme.</p> 
<p>　　Indians, having no use for corduroy small clothes, I speedilydonned mine. Next I quietly but quickly snatched upWilliam's rifle, and presented it to Robinson Crusoe, pattinghim on the back as if with honours of knighthood. Thedispossessed was not well pleased, but Sir Robinson was; and,to all appearances, he was a man of leading, if of darkness.</p> 
<p>　　While words were passing between the two, I sauntered roundto the gentleman who sat cross-legged upon my weapon. He wasas heedless of me as I, outwardly, of him. When well withinreach, mindful that 'DE L'AUDACE' is no bad motto, in loveand war, I suddenly placed my foot upon his chest, tightenedthe extensor muscle of my leg, and sent him heels over head.</p> 
<p>　　In an instant the rifle was mine, and both barrels cocked.</p> 
<p>　　After yesterday's immersion it might not have gone off, butthe offended Indian, though furious, doubtless inferred fromthe histrionic attitude which I at once struck, that I feltconfident it would. With my rifle in hand, with my suitelooking to me to transfer the plunder to them, my positionwas now secure. I put on a shirt - the only one left to me,by the way - my shoes and stockings, and my shooting coat;and picking out William's effects, divided these, with hisammunition, his carpet-bag, and his blankets, amongst myoriginal friends. I was beginning to gather my own thingstogether, when Samson, leading my horse, unexpectedly rodeinto the midst of us. The night was far advanced. TheIndians took their leave; and added to the obligation bybequeathing us a large fresh salmon, which served us for manya day to come.</p> 
<p>　　As a postscript I may add that I found poor Mary's address onone of her letters, and faithfully kept my promise as soon asI reached pen and ink.</p>
