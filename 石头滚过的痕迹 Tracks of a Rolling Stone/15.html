<p>　　For me, it was the inane life of that draff of Society - theyoung man-about-town: the tailor's, the haberdasher's, thebootmaker's, and trinket-maker's, young man; the dancing and'hell'-frequenting young man; the young man of the 'CiderCellars' and Piccadilly saloons; the valiant dove-slayer, thepark-lounger, the young lady's young man - who puts his hatinto mourning, and turns up his trousers because - becausethe other young man does ditto, ditto.</p> 
<p>　　I had a share in the Guards' omnibus box at Covent Garden,with the privilege attached of going behind the scenes. Ah!</p> 
<p>　　that was a real pleasure. To listen night after night toGrisi and Mario, Alboni and Lablache, Viardot and Ronconi,Persiani and Tamburini, - and Jenny Lind too, though she wasat the other house. And what an orchestra was Costa's - withSainton leader, and Lindley and old Dragonetti, who togetherbut alone, accompanied the RECITATIVE with their harmoniouschords on 'cello and double-bass. Is singing a lost art? Oris that but a TEMPORIS ACTI question? We who heard those nowsilent voices fancy there are none to match them nowadays.</p> 
<p>　　Certainly there are no dancers like Taglioni, and Cerito, andFanny Elsler, and Carlotta Grisi.</p> 
<p>　　After the opera and the ball, one finished the night atVauxhall or Ranelagh; then as gay, and exactly the same, asthey were when Miss Becky Sharpe and fat Jos supped thereonly five-and-thirty years before.</p> 
<p>　　Except at the Opera, and the Philharmonic, and Exeter Hall,one rarely heard good music. Monsieur Jullien, that princeof musical mountebanks - the 'Prince of Waterloo,' as JohnElla called him, was the first to popularise classical musicat his promenade concerts, by tentatively introducing asingle movement of a symphony here and there in the programmeof his quadrilles and waltzes and music-hall songs.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Ella, too, furthered the movement with his Musical Unionand quartett parties at Willis's Rooms, where Sainton andCooper led alternately, and the incomparable Piatti and Hillmade up the four. Here Ernst, Sivori, Vieuxtemps, andBottesini, and Mesdames Schumann, Dulcken, Arabella Goddard,and all the famous virtuosi played their solos.</p> 
<p>　　Great was the stimulus thus given by Ella's energy andenthusiasm. As a proof of what he had to contend with, andwhat he triumphed over, Halle's 'Life' may be quoted, whereit says: 'When Mr. Ella asked me [this was in 1848] what Iwished to play, and heard that it was one of Beethoven'spianoforte sonatas, he exclaimed "Impossible!" andendeavoured to demonstrate that they were not works to beplayed in public.' What seven-league boots the world hasstridden in within the memory of living men!</p> 
<p>　　John Ella himself led the second violins in Costa's band, andhad begun life (so I have been told) as a pastry-cook. Iknew both him and the wonderful little Frenchman 'at home.'</p> 
<p>　　According to both, in their different ways, Beethoven andMozart would have been lost to fame but for their heroicefforts to save them.</p> 
<p>　　I used occasionally to play with Ella at the house of a ladywho gave musical parties. He was always attuned to thehighest pitch, - most good-natured, but most excitable wheremusic was to the fore. We were rehearsing a quintett, thepianoforte part of which was played by the young lady of thehouse - a very pretty girl, and not a bad musician, butnervous to the point of hysteria. Ella himself was in ahypercritical state; nothing would go smoothly; and the pianowas always (according to him) the peccant instrument. Againand again he made us restart the movement. There were a goodmany friends of the family invited to this last rehearsal,which made it worse for the poor girl, who was obviously onthe brink of a breakdown. Presently Ella again jumped offhis chair, and shouted: 'Not E flat! There's no E flatthere; E natural! E natural! I never in my life knew ayoung lady so prolific of flats as you.' There was a pause,then a giggle, then an explosion; and then the poor girl,bursting into tears, rushed out of the room.</p> 
<p>　　It was at Ella's house that I first heard Joachim, then aboutsixteen, I suppose. He had not yet performed in London. Allthe musical celebrities were present to hear the youthfulprodigy. Two quartetts were played, Ernst leading one andJoachim the other. After it was over, everyone wasenraptured, but no one more so than Ernst, who unhesitatinglypredicted the fame which the great artist has so eminentlyachieved.</p> 
<p>　　One more amusing little story belongs to my experiences ofthese days. Having two brothers and a brother-in-law in theGuards, I used to dine often at the Tower, or the Bank, orSt. James's. At the Bank of England there is always at nightan officer's guard. There is no mess, as the officer isalone. But the Bank provides dinner for two, in case theofficer should invite a friend. On the occasion I speak of,my brother-in-law, Sir Archibald Macdonald, was on duty. Thesoup and fish were excellent, but we were young and hungry,and the usual leg of mutton was always a dish to be lookedforward to.</p> 
<p>　　When its cover was removed by the waiter we looked in vain;there was plenty of gravy, but no mutton. Our surprise waseven greater than our dismay, for the waiter swore 'So 'elphis gawd' that he saw the cook put the leg on the dish, andthat he himself put the cover on the leg. 'And what did youdo with it then?' questioned my host. 'Nothing, S'Archibald.</p> 
<p>　　Brought it straight in 'ere.' 'Do you mean to tell me it wasnever out of your hands between this and the kitchen?'</p> 
<p>　　'Never, but for the moment I put it down outside the door tochange the plates.' 'And was there nobody in the passage?'</p> 
<p>　　'Not a soul, except the sentry.' 'I see,' said my host, whowas a quick-witted man. 'Send the sergeant here.' Thesergeant came. The facts were related, and the order givento parade the entire guard, sentry included, in the passage.</p> 
<p>　　The sentry was interrogated first. 'No, he had not seennobody in the passage.' 'No one had touched the dish?'</p> 
<p>　　'Nobody as ever he seed.' Then came the orders: 'Attention.</p> 
<p>　　Ground arms. Take off your bear-skins.' And the truth -I.E., the missing leg - was at once revealed; the sentry hadpopped it into his shako. For long after that day, when theguard either for the Tower or Bank marched through thestreets, the little blackguard boys used to run beside it andcry, 'Who stole the leg o' mutton?'</p>
