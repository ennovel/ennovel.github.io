THE NEW MOTHER.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      When the new Mrs. Lincoln entered the humble log-cabin which was to be her future home, it may well be imagined that her heart sank within her at the primitive accommodations, or rather, lack of accommodations.
<br> 
<br> “How do you like it?” asked Thomas Lincoln, who was much more easily satisfied than his wife.
<br> 
<br> “Not at all at present. There are no doors or windows. There is not even a plank floor.”
<br> 
<br> “We have got along without them,” said her husband.
<br> 
<br> “We can’t get along without them any longer. You are a carpenter, and can easily provide them. I will put in my furniture, and after awhile we will have things more comfortable.”
<br> 
<br> “I don’t think we need the bureau. You say it cost forty dollars. You had better sell it. It{18} is sinful extravagance to have so much money in furniture.”
<br> 
<br> “I can’t consent to that,” said Mrs. Lincoln decidedly. “I have nothing that is too good for us. I will see that you and the children live more comfortably in future.”
<br> 
<br> Abe and Nancy looked on with interest while the bureau and the other possessions of their new mother were taken from the wagon by their father and their uncle Ralph. They began to think they were going to live in city style. In particular they admired the bureau which had cost forty dollars. Why, their cabin had not cost that. They felt something like the country minister of sixty years since, to whom his parishioners presented a carpet for the “fore room.” When it was spread on the floor, he gazed at it admiringly and ejaculated, “What, all this and heaven too! This is too much!”
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Lincoln was quite in earnest, and set her husband to work the next day at the improvements she had specified. When after a time they were completed; when the earthen floor was succeeded by one of boards; when two windows had been set in the sides of the cabin, and a door{19} closed up the entrance; when the primitive bed and bedstead had been superseded by the newcomer’s comfortable bedstead and bedding, and the three-legged stools had been removed to give place to chairs, the three children were very happy.
<br> 
<br> And indeed it was a happy day for Thomas Lincoln and his young family when his second wife took charge of his household. She was kind-hearted and energetic, and though she had three children of her own, she was never found wanting in care or affection for her husband’s children. She took a special interest in young Abe. She read him better than his father, and saw that there was that in him which it would pay to develop.
<br> 
<br> To begin with, she rigged him out in new clothes. His ragged condition had excited her sympathy, and she rightly judged that neat attire helps a boy’s or girl’s self-respect. I have no doubt that Abe, though he never had a weakness for fine clothes, surveyed himself complacently when for the first time he saw himself respectably dressed.
<br> 
<br> This is the description of Abe’s step-mother{20} given many years after by Mrs. Chapman, the daughter of Dennis Hanks:
<br> 
<br> “His wife, my grandmother, is a very tall woman, straight as an Indian; fair complexion, and was, when I first remember her, very handsome, sprightly, talkative, and proud; wore her hair curled till gray; is kind-hearted and very charitable, and also very industrious.”
<br> 
<br> It may be mentioned here that this good lady lived long enough to see the neglected boy whom she so kindly took in hand elected to the highest place in the gift of his countrymen.
<br> 
<br> It was not long before Mrs. Lincoln began to broach her plans for the benefit of her step-son.
<br> 
<br> “Abe,” she said one day, “have you ever been to school?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, ma’am. I went to school a little while in Kentucky.”
<br> 
<br> “You didn’t learn much, I suppose?”
<br> 
<br> “Not much; I can read and write a little.”
<br> 
<br> “That’s a good beginning. In this country, Abe, you will never amount to much unless you get an education. Would you like to go to school?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes,” answered the boy earnestly.{21}
<br> 
<br> “I will speak to your father about it. Is there any school near here?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, Mr. Dorsey keeps school about a mile and a half from here, near the Little Pigeon Creek meeting-house.”
<br> 
<br> “You and Nancy and Dennis must go there.” Mrs. Lincoln broached the subject to her husband.
<br> 
<br> “Abe ought to go to school, Thomas,” she said, “and so ought the other children.”
<br> 
<br> “I don’t know as I can spare him,” said his father. “I need his help in the shop and on the farm.”
<br> 
<br> “He can find time out of school hours. The boy must have an education.”
<br> 
<br> “I agree to that, wife. It shall be as you say.”
<br> 
<br> In Mr. Dorsey’s school Abe’s studies were elementary. His time was given to reading, writing, and ciphering. The school-house was about as primitive as the Lincoln cabin before the improvements were made on it. It was built of unhewn logs, and holes stuffed with greased paper supplied the place of windows. It was low-studded, being barely six feet high. The scholars studied in classes, and Abe’s ambition was excited,{22} so that he soon came to be looked upon as one of the foremost scholars.
<br> 
<br> A year or two later, in the same humble school-house, a new teacher named Andrew Crawford wielded the ferule. He was, it may be inferred, a better scholar than Mr. Dorsey, and was able to carry his pupils further.
<br> 
<br> Abe was now in his fifteenth year, and was growing at an alarming rate. He was already nearly six feet in height, and must have presented a singular appearance in the rustic garb in which he presented himself at this temple of learning. I quote Mr. Lamon’s description of his physical appearance and dress:
<br> 
<br> “He was growing at a tremendous rate, and two years later attained his full height of six feet four inches. He was long, wiry, and strong; while his big feet and hands and the length of his legs and arms were out of all proportion to his small trunk and head. His complexion was very swarthy, and Mrs. Gentry says that his skin was shrivelled and yellow even then. He wore low shoes, buckskin breeches, linsey-wolsey shirt, and a cap made of the skin of an opposum or a coon. The breeches clung close to his thighs and{23} legs, but failed by a large space to meet the tops of his shoes. Twelve inches remained uncovered and exposed that much of ‘shin-bone—sharp, blue, and narrow.’ ‘He would always come to school thus, good-humoredly and laughing,’ says his old friend, Nat Grigsby. ‘He was always in good health, never was sick, had an excellent constitution, and took care of it.’ ”
<br> 
<br> It impresses us rather curiously to learn that the new teacher Crawford undertook to teach “manners” to the rough brood that was under his charge. It was certainly a desirable accomplishment, but the teaching must have been attended with some difficulties.
<br> 
<br> For the amusement of my young readers I will try to describe one of these lessons. Mr. Crawford wished the boys to learn how to enter a room and pay their respects to the assembled company.
<br> 
<br> “Abe, it is your turn,” he says.
<br> 
<br> Abe Lincoln, understanding what is meant, rose from his seat, and retires from the room. A moment later a knock is heard at the door. A scholar, specially deputed to do so—we will{24} suppose Nat Grigsby—advances to the door and opens it.
<br> 
<br> Before him stands Abe—tall, awkward, with the lower part of his limbs exposed.
<br> 
<br> Nat bows, and, taking him by the arm, leads him from bench to bench, presenting him to his fellow-pupils, as though he were a guest going the rounds in a drawing-room. Abe, who was never without a sense of fun, no doubt stole timorous glances askance at his rustic garb as he strode here and there, bowing politely to the boys and girls whom he knew so well. Yet it is possible that this exercise may have made it less awkward for him in later days to attend to his social duties when events brought him prominently before the country.
<br> 
<br> So far from laughing at Master Crawford’s instruction in manners, I am disposed to think very favorably of it. He must on the whole have been a sensible man, and no doubt had a considerable influence over the rough boys who submitted willingly to what possibly struck them as ludicrous.
<br> 
<br> I doubt, however, with all his pains, whether he succeeded in making Abe Lincoln graceful or courtly. On the whole, he was rather unpromising{25} material; being long, lank, and awkward. Yet this tall, gawky boy was laying the foundation of a noble manhood. He was making the most of his slender advantages, not dreaming what greatness the Future had in store for him.
