LINCOLN AS A CLERK</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      Young Lincoln’s successful trip to New Orleans led to his engagement for a similar trip in the early part of 1831. With him were associated John Hanks and John Johnston. Their employer was a Mr. Denton Offutt, of Lexington, Kentucky, and a part of the cargo consisted of a drove of hogs. Each of the three was to be paid at the rate of fifty cents per day, and the round sum of sixty dollars divided between them. Abe considered this very good pay, and was very glad to make the engagement. The three young men not only managed the boat, but built it, and this retarded the expedition. We read with some interest that while they were boarding themselves at Sangamontown, while building the boat, Abe officiated as cook to the entire satisfaction of his associates.{61}
<br> 
<br> “At New Orleans,” says John Hanks, “we saw negroes chained, maltreated, whipped, and scourged. Lincoln saw it; his heart bled, he said nothing much, was silent from feeling, was sad, looked bad, felt bad, was thoughtful and abstracted. I can say, knowing it, that it was on this trip that he formed his opinions of slavery. It run its iron in him then and there,—May, 1831. I have heard him say so often and often.”
<br> 
<br> One day, soon after his return from his second river trip, Abe received a visit from a muscular, powerfully-built man, who accosted him thus: “You are Abe Lincoln, I reckon?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes,” said Abe; “you are right there.”
<br> 
<br> “I’ve heard you can wrestle some,” continued the stranger.
<br> 
<br> “A little,” answered young Lincoln, modestly.
<br> 
<br> “I’ve come to wrestle with you to see who’s the best man. My name’s Daniel Needham.”
<br> 
<br> The stranger announced his name with evident pride, and young Lincoln recognized it as that of a man who had a high reputation as an amateur pugilist.
<br> 
<br> “I’m glad to know you,” said Lincoln, “and I don’t mind accepting your challenge.”{62}
<br> 
<br> Abe valued his popularity among the boys, and, though he did not feel sure of the result, he felt that it would not do to back out. He would lose his reputation, which was considerable.
<br> 
<br> “Where shall it be?” asked Needham.
<br> 
<br> “Just where and when you like,” answered Abe, promptly.
<br> 
<br> So the meeting was fixed in the “greenwood” at Wabash Point, and there it was that the two met in friendly rivalry.
<br> 
<br> Though Daniel Needham was older and more firmly knit, Lincoln was sinewy and strong, and his superior height, and long arms and legs gave him a great advantage—sufficient to compensate for his youth and spareness.
<br> 
<br> The result was that Abe achieved victory in short order. He threw his older opponent twice with so much ease that Needham rose to his feet very much mortified as well as astonished.
<br> 
<br> “Lincoln,” said he, making the confession reluctantly, “you have thrown me twice, but you can’t whip me.”
<br> 
<br> “Are you satisfied that I can throw you?” asked Abe. “If you are not, and must be convinced through a thrashing, I will do that too for your sake.”{63}
<br> 
<br> “I reckon we’ll put it off,” said Needham, finding his young rival more willing than he had expected. He had hoped that, though not shrinking from a friendly wrestling contest, Abe might hesitate to meet him in a more serious encounter.
<br> 
<br> I have told this story partly because I know my young readers would be interested in it, partly to give an idea of the strength and athletic power of the hero of my story.
<br> 
<br> But wrestling contests would not earn a living for young Lincoln. He was in search of employment, and found it. As one thing leads to another, the same man who had sent him to New Orleans in charge of a flat-boat, opened a store at New Salem, and needing a clerk, bethought himself of young Lincoln. Abe unpacked the goods upon their arrival, and worked energetically to put them in order. With a new store-book, serving as a ledger, and a pen behind his ear, he made his début as a “first clerk” of the leading mercantile establishment in the town. In the readiness with which he turned from one thing to another, Abe might well be taken for a typical Yankee, though born in Kentucky.
<br> 
<br> We are now to look upon the future President{64} in a new capacity. As a clerk he proved honest and efficient, and my readers will be interested in some illustrations of the former trait which I find in Dr. Holland’s interesting volume.
<br> 
<br> One day a woman came into the store and purchased sundry articles. They footed up two dollars and six and a quarter cents, or the young clerk thought they did. We do not hear nowadays of six and a quarter cents, but this was a coin borrowed from the Spanish currency, and was well known in my own boyhood.
<br> 
<br> The bill was paid, and the woman was entirely satisfied. But the young store-keeper, not feeling quite sure as to the accuracy of his calculation, added up the items once more. To his dismay he found that the sum total should have been but two dollars.
<br> 
<br> “I’ve made her pay six and a quarter cents too much,” said Abe, disturbed.
<br> 
<br> It was a trifle, and many clerks would have dismissed it as such. But Abe was too conscientious for that.
<br> 
<br> “The money must be paid back,” he decided.
<br> 
<br> This would have been easy enough had the woman lived “just round the corner,” but, as the{65} young man knew, she lived between two and three miles away. This, however, did not alter the matter. It was night, but he closed and locked the store, and walked to the residence of his customer. Arrived there, he explained the matter, paid over the six and a quarter cents, and returned satisfied. If I were a capitalist, I would be willing to lend money to such a young man without security.
<br> 
<br> Here is another illustration of young Lincoln’s strict honesty:
<br> 
<br> A woman entered the store and asked for half a pound of tea.
<br> 
<br> The young clerk weighed it out, and handed it to her in a parcel. This was the last sale of the day.
<br> 
<br> The next morning, when commencing his duties, Abe discovered a four-ounce weight on the scales. It flashed upon him at once that he had used this in the sale of the night previous, and so, of course, given his customer short weight. I am afraid that there are many country merchants who would not have been much worried by this discovery. Not so the young clerk in whom we are interested. He weighed out the balance of{66} the half pound, shut up store, and carried it to the defrauded customer. I think my young readers will begin to see that the name so often given, in later times, to President Lincoln, of “Honest Old Abe,” was well deserved. A man who begins by strict honesty in his youth is not likely to change as he grows older, and mercantile honesty is some guarantee of political honesty.
<br> 
<br> There is another incident for which I am also indebted to Dr. Holland:
<br> 
<br> The young clerk was waiting upon two or three ladies, when a noted bully entered the store, and began to talk in a manner offensive not only to the ladies, but to any person of refinement.
<br> 
<br> Young Lincoln leaned over the counter, and said quietly, “Don’t you see that ladies are present?”
<br> 
<br> “What is that to me?” demanded the bully.
<br> 
<br> “Out of respect for them, will you stop your rough talk?”
<br> 
<br> “I will talk as I please, and I should like to see the man that will stop me,” answered the bully, arrogantly. “If you think you are the better man, we’ll try it on the spot.”
<br> 
<br> Lincoln began to see that the man meant to{67}
<br> Image unavailable: ABE’S EARLY HOME. THE LOG CABIN. Page 9
<br> ABE’S EARLY HOME. THE LOG CABIN. Page 9
<br> 
<br> force a quarrel upon him, and he did not shrink from it.
<br> 
<br> “If you will wait till the ladies retire,” he said quietly, “I will give you any satisfaction you wish.”
<br> 
<br> The ladies had by this time completed their purchases, and were glad to leave the store.
<br> 
<br> No sooner had they left than the bully broke out into a storm of abuses and insults. The young clerk listened with the quiet patience habitual to him, and finally observed: “Well, if you must be whipped, I suppose I may as well whip you as any other man.”
<br> 
<br> “That’s what I’m after,” answered the bully.
<br> 
<br> “Come outdoors, then,” said Lincoln.
<br> 
<br> Abe, when they were fairly outside, thought there was no need of further delay. He grappled with the bully, threw him upon the ground with ease, and, holding him there, rubbed some “smart-weed” in his face and eyes till he bellowed for mercy.
<br> 
<br> “Do you give up?” asked Abe, in no way excited.
<br> 
<br> “Yes, yes!”
<br> 
<br> Upon this, Lincoln went for some water, washed{68} his victim’s face, and did what he could to alleviate his sufferings. It is safe to say that the fellow never wanted another dose of the same medicine. It will further interest my young readers to learn that, so far from feeling a grudge against Lincoln, the bully became his fast friend, and behaved henceforth in a more creditable manner.
