THE LOG-CABIN.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      Three children stood in front of a rough log-cabin in a small clearing won from the surrounding forest. The country round about was wild and desolate. Not far away was a vast expanse of forest, including oaks, beeches, walnuts and the usual variety of forest trees.
<br> 
<br> We are in Indiana, and the patch of land on which the humble log-cabin stood is between the forks of Big Pigeon and Little Pigeon Creeks, a mile and a half east of Gentryville, a small village not then in existence.
<br> 
<br> The oldest of the three children was Nancy{10} Lincoln, about twelve years old. Leaning against the cabin in a careless attitude was a tall, spindling boy, thin-faced, and preternaturally grave, with a swarthy complexion. He was barefoot and ragged; the legs of his pantaloons, which were much too short, revealing the lower part of his long legs; for in his boyhood, as in after days, he ran chiefly to legs.
<br> 
<br> Who in the wildest flight of a daring imagination would venture to predict that this awkward, sad-faced, ragged boy would forty years later sit in the chair of Washington, and become one of the rulers of the earth? I know of nothing more wonderful in the Arabian Nights than this.
<br> 
<br> The second boy was a cousin of the other two children—Dennis Hanks, who, after the death of his parents, had come to live in the Lincoln household.
<br> 
<br> The sun was near its setting. It seemed already to have set, for it was hidden by the forest trees behind which it had disappeared.
<br> 
<br> “Abe,” said the girl, addressing her brother, “do you think father will be home to-night?”
<br> 
<br> “I reckon,” answered Abe laconically, shifting from one foot to the other.{11}
<br> 
<br> “I hope so,” said Dennis. “It’s lonesome stayin’ here by ourselves.”
<br> 
<br> “There some one comin’ with father,” said Nancy slowly. “We’re goin’ to have a new mother. I hope we’ll like her.”
<br> 
<br> “It’ll seem good to have a woman in the house,” said Dennis. “It seems lonesome-like where they’re all men.”
<br> 
<br> “I reckon you mean yourself and me,” said Abe smiling.
<br> 
<br> The boy’s grave, thin face brightened up as he said this in a humorous tone.
<br> 
<br> “Then I ought to be considered a woman if you two are goin’ to set up as men,” said Nancy. “But Dennis is right. It’ll be good for us if she’s the right sort. Some step-mothers ain’t.”
<br> 
<br> “I reckon you’re right,” said Abe again.
<br> 
<br> “I’m afraid she won’t like the house,” said Nancy. “It ain’t as good as it might be, though it’s better than the ‘camp’ we used to live in.”
<br> 
<br> As she spoke her eyes turned toward an even more primitive dwelling forty yards away. It was known as “a half-faced camp,” and was merely a cabin enclosed on three sides and open on the fourth; built not of logs, but of poles. It{12} was fourteen feet square, and without a floor. Here it was that the elder Lincoln lived with his family when first he settled down in the Indiana wilderness after his removal from Kentucky. The present dwelling was an improvement on the first, but how far it was from being comfortable may be judged from a description.
<br> 
<br> It was indeed a cabin, while the other had been only a camp, but it had neither floor, door, nor window. There was a doorway for an entrance, but there was nothing to keep out intruders. There was small temptation, however, for the professional burglar. The possessions of the Lincolns were altogether beneath the notice of even the poorest tramp. A few three-legged stools served for chairs. In one corner of the cabin was an extemporized bedstead made of poles stuck in the cracks of the logs, while the other end rested in the crotch of a forked stick sunk in the earthen floor. A bag of leaves covered with skins and old petticoats rested on some boards laid over the poles. Here had slept the elder Lincoln and his wife, while Abe laid himself down in the loft above. A hewed puncheon supported by four legs served for a table. A{13} few dishes of pewter and tin completed the list of furniture.
<br> 
<br> This was the home to which Thomas Lincoln was bringing his new wife. She was a widow from Elizabethtown in Kentucky, where he had formerly lived. She was an old flame of Mr. Lincoln, but had rejected him, being able, as she thought, to do better. But when within a few years he became a widower and she a widow, the suit was renewed and the answer was favorable.
<br> 
<br> Even now the married pair are on their way home.
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Johnston considered herself a poor widow, but she was much better off than the man she had just married. She was the owner of a bureau that cost forty dollars; this alone being a value far greater than her new husband’s entire stock of furniture. Other articles, too, she had, including a table, a set of chairs, a large clothes chest, cooking utensils, knives, forks, bedding, and other articles.
<br> 
<br> “Look, Abe!” said Nancy in sudden excitement, pointing to an approaching vehicle.
<br> 
<br> Abe followed the direction of his sister’s finger, and he opened his eyes in astonishment. A large{14} four-horse team was in sight—a strange and unusual spectacle in that wilderness. The children could not have been more excited if Barnum’s grand procession of circus chariots had filed into view—a vision of Oriental splendor.
<br> 
<br> “There’s father!” exclaimed Abe, distinguishing with a boy’s keen vision the well-known figure of his father sitting beside the driver.
<br> 
<br> “Father and Uncle Ralph,” corrected Nancy.
<br> 
<br> “And the team’s full of furniture. Can it be comin’ here?”
<br> 
<br> “I reckon your new mother’s aboard,” said Dennis.
<br> 
<br> This remark made the children thoughtful, because it recalled their own sad-faced and gentle mother who had faded from life a year before and gone uncomplainingly to her rest. Then, besides, the prospect of a step-mother is apt to be disquieting when nothing is known of her disposition or character.
<br> 
<br> “Is all that furniture comin’ here?” soliloquized Nancy wonderingly.
<br> 
<br> “I reckon so,” answered Abe.
<br> 
<br> When the team came nearer another exciting discovery was made. There were others aboard{15} the wagon besides their father, their new mother, and their uncle Ralph Krame, who was the owner of the team. There were two girls and a boy, children of Mrs. Lincoln by her former marriage. They were not far from the same age as the three children who were awaiting their arrival, but they were much better dressed. It was clear that the log-cabin would no longer be lonely. It would be full and running over. The six children and their parents were to be crowded into it.
<br> 
<br> “That is my house, Sally,” said Thomas Lincoln, pointing out the cabin in the woods to his new wife.
<br> 
<br> “That!” she exclaimed in dismay, for her new husband had led her to expect that he was tolerably well-to-do, not with any intention to deceive, but mainly because they had different standards of comfort.
<br> 
<br> We can imagine that the heart of the new wife must have sunk within her as from the wagon she caught the first sight of her future home. She had not been accustomed to luxury, but her old home was luxurious compared with this.
<br> 
<br> She relapsed into silence, and did not choose to make her husband uncomfortable by revealing{16} the true state of her feelings. She seems to have been a capable woman, and probably made up her mind upon the instant to make “the best of it.” Besides, she had already caught sight of the children.
<br> 
<br> “And those are Nancy and Abe?” she said.
<br> 
<br> “Yes,” answered Thomas Lincoln. “That’s Abe with the long legs, and the other boy is his cousin Dennis.”
<br> 
<br> The new Mrs. Lincoln regarded with womanly compassion the three neglected children, and in her heart she resolved to make their lot more desirable. Perhaps the children read her face aright, for, as they scanned her kindly face, all fear of the new step-mother disappeared, and they responded shyly, but cordially, to her greeting.
