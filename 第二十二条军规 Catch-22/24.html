Lilacs bloomed in April and fruit ripened on the vine. Heartbeatsquickened and old appetites were renewed. In April a livelier iris gleamed upon the burnished dove. April wasspring, and in the spring Milo Minderbinder’s fancy had lightly turned to thoughts of tangerines.</p> 
<p>　　“Tangerines?”</p> 
<p>　　“Yes, sir.”</p> 
<p>　　“My men would love tangerines,” admitted the colonel in Sardinia who commanded four squadrons of B-26s.</p> 
<p>　　“There’ll be all the tangerines they can eat that you’re able to pay for with money from your mess fund,” Miloassured him.</p> 
<p>　　“Casaba melons?”</p> 
<p>　　“Are going for a song in Damascus.”</p> 
<p>　　“I have a weakness for casaba melons. I’ve always had a weakness for casaba melons.”</p> 
<p>　　“Just lend me one plane from each squadron, just one plane, and you’ll have all the casabas you can eat thatyou’ve money to pay for.”</p> 
<p>　　“We buy from the syndicate?”</p> 
<p>　　“And everybody has a share.”</p> 
<p>　　“It’s amazing, positively amazing. How can you do it?”</p> 
<p>　　“Mass purchasing power makes the big difference. For example, breaded veal cutlets.”</p> 
<p>　　“I’m not so crazy about breaded veal cutlets,” grumbled the skeptical B-25 commander in the north of Corsica.</p> 
<p>　　“Breaded veal cutlets are very nutritious,” Milo admonished him piously. “They contain egg yolk and breadcrumbs. And so are lamb chops.”</p> 
<p>　　“Ah, lamb chops,” echoed the B-25 commander. “Good lamb chops?”</p> 
<p>　　“The best,” said Milo, “that the black market has to offer.”</p> 
<p>　　“Baby lamb chops?”</p> 
<p>　　“In the cutest little pink paper panties you ever saw. Are going for a song in Portugal.”</p> 
<p>　　“I can’t send a plane to Portugal. I haven’t the authority.”</p> 
<p>　　“I can, once you lend the plane to me. With a pilot to fly it. And don’t forget—you’ll get General Dreedle.”</p> 
<p>　　“Will General Dreedle eat in my mess hall again?”</p> 
<p>　　“Like a pig, once you start feeding him my best white fresh eggs fried in my pure creamery butter. There’ll betangerines too, and casaba melons, honeydews, filet of Dover sole, baked Alaska, and cockles and mussels.”</p> 
<p>　　“And everybody has a share?”</p> 
<p>　　“That,” said Milo, “is the most beautiful part of it.”</p> 
<p>　　“I don’t like it,” growled the unco-operative fighter-plane commander, who didn’t like Milo either.</p> 
<p>　　“There’s an unco-operative fighter-plane commander up north who’s got it in for me,” Milo complained toGeneral Dreedle. “It takes just one person to ruin the whole thing, and then you wouldn’t have your fresh eggsfried in my pure creamery butter any more.”</p> 
<p>　　General Dreedle had the unco-operative fighter-plane commander transferred to the Solomon Islands to diggraves and replaced him with a senile colonel with bursitis and a craving for litchi nuts who introduced Milo tothe B-17 general on the mainland with a yearning for Polish sausage.</p> 
<p>　　“Polish sausage is going for peanuts in Cracow,” Milo informed him.</p> 
<p>　　“Polish sausage,” sighed the general nostalgically. “You know, I’d give just about anything for a good hunk ofPolish sausage. Just about anything.”</p> 
<p>　　“You don’t have to give anything. Just give me one plane for each mess hall and a pilot who will do what he’stold. And a small down payment on your initial order as a token of good faith.”</p> 
<p>　　“But Cracow is hundreds of miles behind the enemy lines. How will you get to the sausage?”</p> 
<p>　　“There’s an international Polish sausage exchange in Geneva. I’ll just fly the peanuts into Switzerland andexchange them for Polish sausage at the open market rate. They’ll fly the peanuts back to Cracow and I’ll fly thePolish sausage back to you. You buy only as much Polish sausage as you want through the syndicate. There’ll betangerines too, with only a little artificial coloring added. And eggs from Malta and Scotch from Sicily. You’ll bepaying the money to yourself when you buy from the syndicate, since you’ll own a share, so you’ll really begetting everything you buy for nothing. Doesn’t that makes sense?”</p> 
<p>　　“Sheer genius. How in the world did you ever think of it?”</p> 
<p>　　“My name is Milo Minderbinder. I am twenty-seven years old.”</p> 
<p>　　Milo Minderbinder’s planes flew in from everywhere, the pursuit planes, bombers, and cargo ships streaminginto Colonel Cathcart’s field with pilots at the controls who would do what they were told. The planes were decorated with flamboyant squadron emblems illustrating such laudable ideals as Courage, Might, Justice, Truth,Liberty, Love, Honor and Patriotism that were painted out at once by Milo’s mechanics with a double coat of flatwhite and replaced in garish purple with the stenciled name M &amp; M ENTERPRISES, FINE FRUITS ANDPRODUCE. The ‘M &amp; M’ In ‘M &amp; M ENTERPRISES’ stood for Milo &amp; Minderbinder, and the &amp; was inserted,Milo revealed candidly, to nullify any impression that the syndicate was a one-man operation. Planes arrived forMilo from airfields in Italy, North Africa and England, and from Air Transport Command stations in Liberia,Ascension Island, Cairo, and Karachi. Pursuit planes were traded for additional cargo ships or retained foremergency invoice duty and small-parcel service; trucks and tanks were procured from the ground forces andused for short-distance road hauling. Everybody had a share, and men got fat and moved about tamely withtoothpicks in their greasy lips. Milo supervised the whole expanding operation by himself. Deep otter-brownlines of preoccupation etched themselves permanently into his careworn face and gave him a harried look ofsobriety and mistrust. Everybody but Yossarian thought Milo was a jerk, first for volunteering for the job ofmess officer and next for taking it so seriously. Yossarian also thought that Milo was a jerk; but he also knewthat Milo was a genius.</p> 
<p>　　One day Milo flew away to England to pick up a load of Turkish halvah and came flying back from Madagascarleading four German bombers filled with yams, collards, mustard greens and black-eyed Georgia peas. Milo wasdumbfounded when he stepped down to the ground and found a contingent of armed M.P.s waiting to imprisonthe German pilots and confiscate their planes. Confiscate! The mere word was anathema to him, and he stormedback and forth in excoriating condemnation, shaking a piercing finger of rebuke in the guilt-ridden faces ofColonel Cathcart, Colonel Korn and the poor battle-scarred captain with the submachine gun who commandedthe M.P.s.</p> 
<p>　　“Is this Russia?” Milo assailed them incredulously at the top of his voice. “Confiscate?” he shrieked, as thoughhe could not believe his own ears. “Since when is it the policy of the American government to confiscate theprivate property of its citizens? Shame on you! Shame on all of you for even thinking such a horrible thought.”</p> 
<p>　　“But Milo,” Major Danby interrupted timidly, “we’re at war with Germany, and those are German planes.”</p> 
<p>　　“They are no such thing!” Milo retorted furiously. “Those planes belong to the syndicate, and everybody has ashare. Confiscate? How can you possibly confiscate your own private property? Confiscate, indeed! I’ve neverheard anything so depraved in my whole life.”</p> 
<p>　　And sure enough, Milo was right, for when they looked, his mechanics had painted out the German swastikas onthe wings, tails and fuselages with double coats of flat white and stenciled in the words M &amp; M ENTERPRISES,FINE FRUITS AND PRODUCE. Right before their eyes he had transformed his syndicate into an internationalcartel.</p> 
<p>　　Milo’s argosies of plenty now filled the air. Planes poured in from Norway, Denmark, France, Germany, Austria,Italy, Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Sweden, Finland, Poland—from everywhere in Europe, in fact, butRussia, with whom Milo refused to do business. When everybody who was going to had signed up with M &amp; MEnterprises, Fine Fruits and Produce, Milo created a wholly owned subsidiary, M &amp; M Fancy Pastry, andobtained more airplanes and more money from the mess funds for scones and crumpets from the British Isles, prune and cheese Danish from Copenhagen, éclairs, cream puffs, Napoleons and petits fours from Paris, Reimsand Grenoble, Kugelhopf, pumpernickel and Pfefferkuchen from Berlin, Linzer and Dobos Torten from Vienna,Strudel from Hungary and baklava from Ankara. Each morning Milo sent planes aloft all over Europe and NorthAfrica hauling long red tow signs advertising the day’s specials in large square letters: “EYEROUND, 79￠...</p> 
<p>　　WHITING, 21￠.” He boosted cash income for the syndicate by leasing tow signs to Pet Milk, Gaines DogFood, and Noxzema. In a spirit of civic enterprise, he regularly allotted a certain amount of free aerial advertisingspace to General Peckem for the propagation of such messages in the public interest as NEATNESS COUNTS,HASTE MAKES WASTE, and THE FAMILY THAT PRAYS TOGETHER STAYS TOGETHER. Milopurchased spot radio announcements on Axis Sally’s and Lord Haw Haw’s daily propaganda broadcasts fromBerlin to keep things moving. Business boomed on every battlefront.</p> 
<p>　　Milo’s planes were a familiar sight. They had freedom of passage everywhere, and one day Milo contracted withthe American military authorities to bomb the German-held highway bridge at Orvieto and with the Germanmilitary authorities to defend the highway bridge at Orvieto with antiaircraft fire against his own attack. His feefor attacking the bridge for America was the total cost of the operation plus six per cent and his fee fromGermany for defending the bridge was the same cost-plus-six agreement augmented by a merit bonus of athousand dollars for every American plane he shot down. The consummation of these deals represented animportant victory for private enterprise, he pointed out, since the armies of both countries were socializedinstitutions. Once the contracts were signed, there seemed to be no point in using the resources of the syndicateto bomb and defend the bridge, inasmuch as both governments had ample men and material right there to do soand were perfectly happy to contribute them, and in the end Milo realized a fantastic profit from both halves ofhis project for doing nothing more than signing his name twice.</p> 
<p>　　The arrangements were fair to both sides. Since Milo did have freedom of passage everywhere, his planes wereable to steal over in a sneak attack without alerting the German antiaircraft gunners; and since Milo knew aboutthe attack, he was able to alert the German antiaircraft gunners in sufficient time for them to begin firingaccurately the moment the planes came into range. It was an ideal arrangement for everyone but the dead man inYossarian’s tent, who was killed over the target the day he arrived.</p> 
<p>　　“I didn’t kill him!” Milo kept replying passionately to Yossarian’s angry protest. “I wasn’t even there that day, Itell you. Do you think I was down there on the ground firing an antiaircraft gun when the planes came over?”</p> 
<p>　　“But you organized the whole thing, didn’t you?” Yossarian shouted back at him in the velvet darkness cloakingthe path leading past the still vehicles of the motor pool to the open-air movie theater.</p> 
<p>　　“And I didn’t organize anything,” Milo answered indignantly, drawing great agitated sniffs of air in through hishissing, pale, twitching nose. “The Germans have the bridge, and we were going to bomb it, whether I steppedinto the picture or not. I just saw a wonderful opportunity to make some profit out of the mission, and I took it.</p> 
<p>　　What’s so terrible about that?”</p> 
<p>　　“What’s so terrible about it? Milo, a man in my tent was killed on that mission before he could even unpack hisbags.”</p> 
<p>　　“But I didn’t kill him.”</p> 
<p>　　“You got a thousand dollars extra for it.”</p> 
<p>　　“But I didn’t kill him. I wasn’t even there, I tell you. I was in Barcelona buying olive oil and skinless andboneless sardines, and I’ve got the purchase orders to prove it. And I didn’t get the thousand dollars. Thatthousand dollars went to the syndicate, and everybody got a share, even you.” Milo was appealing to Yossarianfrom the bottom of his soul. “Look, I didn’t start this war, Yossarian, no matter what that lousy Wintergreen issaying. I’m just trying to put it on a businesslike basis. Is anything wrong with that? You know, a thousanddollars ain’t such a bad price for a medium bomber and a crew. If I can persuade the Germans to pay me athousand dollars for every plane they shoot down, why shouldn’t I take it?”</p> 
<p>　　“Because you’re dealing with the enemy, that’s why. Can’t you understand that we’re fighting a war? People aredying. Look around you, for Christ’s sake!”</p> 
<p>　　Milo shook his head with weary forbearance. “And the Germans are not our enemies,” he declared. “Oh I knowwhat you’re going to say. Sure, we’re at war with them. But the Germans are also members in good standing ofthe syndicate, and it’s my job to protect their rights as shareholders. Maybe they did start the war, and maybethey are killing millions of people, but they pay their bills a lot more promptly than some allies of ours I couldname. Don’t you understand that I have to respect the sanctity of my contract with Germany? Can’t you see itfrom my point of view?”</p> 
<p>　　“No,” Yossarian rebuffed him harshly.</p> 
<p>　　Milo was stung and made no effort to disguise his wounded feelings. It was a muggy, moonlit night filled withgnats, moths, and mosquitoes. Milo lifted his arm suddenly and pointed toward the open-air theater, where themilky, dust-filled beam bursting horizontally from the projector slashed a conelike swath in the blackness anddraped in a fluorescent membrane of light the audience tilted on the seats there in hypnotic sags, their facesfocused upward toward the aluminized movie screen. Milo’s eyes were liquid with integrity, and his artless anduncorrupted face was lustrous with a shining mixture of sweat and insect repellent.</p> 
<p>　　“Look at them,” he exclaimed in a voice choked with emotion. “They’re my friends, my countrymen, mycomrades in arms. A fellow never had a better bunch of buddies. Do you think I’d do a single thing to harm themif I didn’t have to? Haven’t I got enough on my mind? Can’t you see how upset I am already about all that cottonpiling up on those piers in Egypt?” Milo’s voice splintered into fragments, and he clutched at Yossarian’s shirtfront as though drowning. His eyes were throbbing visibly like brown caterpillars. “Yossarian, what am I goingto do with so much cotton? It’s all your fault for letting me buy it.”</p> 
<p>　　The cotton was piling up on the piers in Egypt, and nobody wanted any. Milo had never dreamed that the NileValley could be so fertile or that there would be no market at all for the crop he had bought. The mess halls in hissyndicate would not help; they rose up in uncompromising rebellion against his proposal to tax them on a percapita basis in order to enable each man to own his own share of the Egyptian cotton crop. Even his reliablefriends the Germans failed him in this crisis: they preferred ersatz. Milo’s mess halls would not even help him store the cotton, and his warehousing costs skyrocketed and contributed to the devastating drain upon his cashreserves. The profits from the Orvieto mission were sucked away. He began writing home for the money he hadsent back in better days; soon that was almost gone. And new bales of cotton kept arriving on the wharves atAlexandria every day. Each time he succeeded in dumping some on the world market for a loss it was snappedup by canny Egyptian brokers in the Levant, who sold it back to him at the original price, so that he was reallyworse off than before.</p> 
<p>　　M &amp; M Enterprises verged on collapse. Milo cursed himself hourly for his monumental greed and stupidity inpurchasing the entire Egyptian cotton crop, but a contract was a contract and had to be honored, and one night,after a sumptuous evening meal, all Milo’s fighters and bombers took off, joined in formation directly overheadand began dropping bombs on the group. He had landed another contract with the Germans, this time to bombhis own outfit. Milo’s planes separated in a well co-ordinated attack and bombed the fuel stocks and theordnance dump, the repair hangars and the B-25 bombers resting on the lollipop-shaped hardstands at the field.</p> 
<p>　　His crews spared the landing strip and the mess halls so that they could land safely when their work was doneand enjoy a hot snack before retiring. They bombed with their landing lights on, since no one was shooting back.</p> 
<p>　　They bombed all four squadrons, the officers’ club and the Group Headquarters building. Men bolted from theirtents in sheer terror and did not know in which direction to turn. Wounded soon lay screaming everywhere. Acluster of fragmentation bombs exploded in the yard of the officers’ club and punched jagged holes in the side ofthe wooden building and in the bellies and backs of a row of lieutenants and captains standing at the bar. Theydoubled over in agony and dropped. The rest of the officers fled toward the two exits in panic and jammed up thedoorways like a dense, howling dam of human flesh as they shrank from going farther.</p> 
<p>　　Colonel Cathcart clawed and elbowed his way through the unruly, bewildered mass until he stood outside byhimself. He stared up at the sky in stark astonishment and horror. Milo’s planes, ballooning serenely in over theblossoming treetops with their bomb bay doors open and wing flaps down and with their monstrous, bug-eyed,blinding, fiercely flickering, eerie landing lights on, were the most apocalyptic sight he had ever beheld. ColonelCathcart let go a stricken gasp of dismay and hurled himself headlong into his jeep, almost sobbing. He found thegas pedal and the ignition and sped toward the airfield as fast as the rocking car would carry him, his huge flabbyhands clenched and bloodless on the wheel or blaring his horn tormentedly. Once he almost killed himself whenhe swerved with a banshee screech of tires to avoid plowing into a bunch of men running crazily toward the hillsin their underwear with their stunned faces down and their thin arms pressed high around their temples as punyshields. Yellow, orange and red fires were burning on both sides of the road. Tents and trees were in flames, andMilo’s planes kept coming around interminably with their blinking white landing lights on and their bomb baydoors open. Colonel Cathcart almost turned the jeep over when he slammed the brakes on at the control tower.</p> 
<p>　　He leaped from the car while it was still skidding dangerously and hurtled up the flight of steps inside, wherethree men were busy at the instruments and the controls. He bowled two of them aside in his lunge for the nickel-plated microphone, his eyes glittering wildly and his beefy face contorted with stress. He squeezed themicrophone in a bestial grip and began shouting hysterically at the top of his voice.</p> 
<p>　　“Milo, you son of a bitch! Are you crazy? What the hell are you doing? Come down! Come down!”</p> 
<p>　　“Stop hollering so much, will you?” answered Milo, who was standing there right beside him in the controltower with a microphone of his own. “I’m right here.” Milo looked at him with reproof and turned back to his work. “Very good, men, very good,” he chanted into his microphone. “But I see one supply shed still standing.</p> 
<p>　　That will never do, Purvis—I’ve spoken to you about that kind of shoddy work before. Now, you go right backthere this minute and try it again. And this time come in slowly... slowly. Haste makes waste, Purvis. Hastemakes waste. If I’ve told you that once, I must have told you that a hundred times. Haste makes waste.”</p> 
<p>　　The loudspeaker overhead began squawking. “Milo, this is Alvin Brown. I’ve finished dropping my bombs.</p> 
<p>　　What should I do now?”</p> 
<p>　　“Strafe,” said Milo.</p> 
<p>　　“Strafe?” Alvin Brown was shocked.</p> 
<p>　　“We have no choice,” Milo informed him resignedly. “It’s in the contract.”</p> 
<p>　　“Oh, okay, then,” Alvin Brown acquiesced. “In that case I’ll strafe.”</p> 
<p>　　This time Milo had gone too far. Bombing his own men and planes was more than even the most phlegmaticobserver could stomach, and it looked like the end for him. High-ranking government officials poured in toinvestigate. Newspapers inveighed against Milo with glaring headlines, and Congressmen denounced the atrocityin stentorian wrath and clamored for punishment. Mothers with children in the service organized into militantgroups and demanded revenge. Not one voice was raised in his defense. Decent people everywhere wereaffronted, and Milo was all washed up until he opened his books to the public and disclosed the tremendousprofit he had made. He could reimburse the government for all the people and property he had destroyed and stillhave enough money left over to continue buying Egyptian cotton. Everybody, of course, owned a share. And thesweetest part of the whole deal was that there really was no need to reimburse the government at all.</p> 
<p>　　“In a democracy, the government is the people,” Milo explained. “We’re people, aren’t we? So we might just aswell keep the money and eliminate the middleman. Frankly, I’d like to see the government get out of waraltogether and leave the whole field to private industry. If we pay the government everything we owe it, we’llonly be encouraging government control and discouraging other individuals from bombing their own men andplanes. We’ll be taking away their incentive.”</p> 
<p>　　Milo was correct, of course, as everyone soon agreed but a few embittered misfits like Doc Daneeka, who sulkedcantankerously and muttered offensive insinuations about the morality of the whole venture until Milo mollifiedhim with a donation, in the name of the syndicate, of a lightweight aluminum collapsible garden chair that DocDaneeka could fold up conveniently and carry outside his tent each time Chief White Halfoat came inside histent and carry back inside his tent each time Chief White Halfoat came out. Doc Daneeka had lost his headduring Milo’s bombardment; instead of running for cover, he had remained out in the open and performed hisduty, slithering along the ground through shrapnel, strafing and incendiary bombs like a furtive, wily lizard fromcasualty to casualty, administering tourniquets, morphine, splints and sulfanilamide with a dark and dolefulvisage, never saying one word more than he had to and reading in each man’s bluing wound a dreadful portent ofhis own decay. He worked himself relentlessly into exhaustion before the long night was over and came downwith a snife the next day that sent him hurrying querulously into the medical tent to have his temperature taken by Gus and Wes and to obtain a mustard plaster and vaporizer.</p> 
<p>　　Doc Daneeka tended each moaning man that night with the same glum and profound and introverted grief heshowed at the airfield the day of the Avignon mission when Yossarian climbed down the few steps of his planenaked, in a state of utter shock, with Snowden smeared abundantly all over his bare heels and toes, knees, armsand fingers, and pointed inside wordlessly toward where the young radio-gunner lay freezing to death on thefloor beside the still younger tail-gunner who kept falling back into a dead faint each time he opened his eyes andsaw Snowden dying.</p> 
<p>　　Doc Daneeka draped a blanket around Yossarian’s shoulders almost tenderly after Snowden had been removedfrom the plane and carried into an ambulance on a stretcher. He led Yossarian toward his jeep. McWatt helped,and the three drove in silence to the squadron medical tent, where McWatt and Doc Daneeka guided Yossarianinside to a chair and washed Snowden off him with cold wet balls of absorbent cotton. Doc Daneeka gave him apill and a shot that put him to sleep for twelve hours. When Yossarian woke up and went to see him, DocDaneeka gave him another pill and a shot that put him to sleep for another twelve hours. When Yossarian wokeup again and went to see him, Doc Daneeka made ready to give him another pill and a shot.</p> 
<p>　　“How long are you going to keep giving me those pills and shots?” Yossarian asked him.</p> 
<p>　　“Until you feel better.”</p> 
<p>　　“I feel all right now.”</p> 
<p>　　Doc Daneeka’s frail suntanned forehead furrowed with surprise. “Then why don’t you put some clothes on? Whyare you walking around naked?”</p> 
<p>　　“I don’t want to wear a uniform any more.”</p> 
<p>　　Doc Daneeka accepted the explanation and put away his hypodermic syringe. “Are you sure you feel all right?”</p> 
<p>　　“I feel fine. I’m just a little logy from all those pills and shots you’ve been giving me.”</p> 
<p>　　Yossarian went about his business with no clothes on all the rest of that day and was still naked late the nextmorning when Milo, after hunting everywhere else, finally found him sitting up a tree a small distance in back ofthe quaint little military cemetery at which Snowden was being buried. Milo was dressed in his customarybusiness attire—olive-drab trousers, a fresh olive-drab shirt and tie, with one silver first lieutenant’s bargleaming on the collar, and a regulation dress cap with a stiff leather bill.</p> 
<p>　　“I’ve been looking all over for you,” Milo called up to Yossarian from the ground reproachfully.</p> 
<p>　　“You should have looked for me in this tree,” Yossarian answered. “I’ve been up here all morning.”</p> 
<p>　　“Come on down and taste this and tell me if it’s good. It’s very important.”</p> 
<p>　　Yossarian shook his head. He sat nude on the lowest limb of the tree and balanced himself with both handsgrasping the bough directly above. He refused to budge, and Milo had no choice but to stretch both arms aboutthe trunk in a distasteful hug and start climbing. He struggled upward clumsily with loud grunts and wheezes,and his clothes were squashed and crooked by the time he pulled himself up high enough to hook a leg over thelimb and pause for breath. His dress cap was askew and in danger of falling. Milo caught it just in time when itbegan slipping. Globules of perspiration glistened like transparent pearls around his mustache and swelled likeopaque blisters under his eyes. Yossarian watched him impassively. Cautiously Milo worked himself around in ahalf circle so that he could face Yossarian. He unwrapped tissue paper from something soft, round and brownand handed it to Yossarian.</p> 
<p>　　“Please taste this and let me know what you think. I’d like to serve it to the men.”</p> 
<p>　　“What is it?” asked Yossarian, and took a big bite.</p> 
<p>　　“Chocolate-covered cotton.”</p> 
<p>　　Yossarian gagged convulsively and sprayed his big mouthful of chocolate-covered cotton right into Milo’s face.</p> 
<p>　　“Here, take it back!” he spouted angrily. “Jesus Christ! Have you gone crazy? You didn’t even take the goddamseeds out.”</p> 
<p>　　“Give it a chance, will you?” Milo begged. “It can’t be that bad. Is it really that bad?”</p> 
<p>　　“It’s even worse.”</p> 
<p>　　“But I’ve got to make the mess halls feed it to the men.”</p> 
<p>　　“They’ll never be able to swallow it.”</p> 
<p>　　“They’ve got to swallow it,” Milo ordained with dictatorial grandeur, and almost broke his neck when he let gowith one arm to wave a righteous finger in the air.</p> 
<p>　　“Come on out here,” Yossarian invited him. “You’ll be much safer, and you can see everything.”</p> 
<p>　　Gripping the bough above with both hands, Milo began inching his way out on the limb sideways with utmostcare and apprehension. His face was rigid with tension, and he sighed with relief when he found himself seatedsecurely beside Yossarian. He stroked the tree affectionately. “This is a pretty good tree,” he observedadmiringly with proprietary gratitude.</p> 
<p>　　“It’s the tree of life,” Yossarian answered, waggling his toes, “and of knowledge of good and evil, too.”</p> 
<p>　　Milo squinted closely at the bark and branches. “No it isn’t,” he replied. “It’s a chestnut tree. I ought to know. Isell chestnuts.”</p> 
<p>　　“Have it your way.”</p> 
<p>　　They sat in the tree without talking for several seconds, their legs dangling and their hands almost straight up onthe bough above, the one completely nude but for a pair of crepe-soled sandals, the other completely dressed in acoarse olive-drab woolen uniform with his tie knotted tight. Milo studied Yossarian diffidently through thecorner of his eye, hesitating tactfully.</p> 
<p>　　“I want to ask you something,” he said at last. “You don’t have any clothes on. I don’t want to butt in oranything, but I just want to know. Why aren’t you wearing your uniform?”</p> 
<p>　　“I don’t want to.”</p> 
<p>　　Milo nodded rapidly like a sparrow pecking. “I see, I see,” he stated quickly with a look of vivid confusion. “Iunderstand perfectly. I heard Appleby and Captain Black say you had gone crazy, and I just wanted to find out.”</p> 
<p>　　He hesitated politely again, weighing his next question. “Aren’t you ever going to put your uniform on again?”</p> 
<p>　　“I don’t think so.”</p> 
<p>　　Milo nodded with spurious vim to indicate he still understood and then sat silent, ruminating gravely withtroubled misgiving. A scarlet-crested bird shot by below, brushing sure dark wings against a quivering bush.</p> 
<p>　　Yossarian and Milo were covered in their bower by tissue-thin tiers of sloping green and largely surrounded byother gray chestnut trees and a silver spruce. The sun was high overhead in a vast sapphire-blue sky beaded withlow, isolated, puffy clouds of dry and immaculate white. There was no breeze, and the leaves about them hungmotionless. The shade was feathery. Everything was at peace but Milo, who straightened suddenly with amuffled cry and began pointing excitedly.</p> 
<p>　　“Look at that!” he exclaimed in alarm. “Look at that! That’s a funeral going on down there. That looks like thecemetery. Isn’t it?”</p> 
<p>　　Yossarian answered him slowly in a level voice. “They’re burying that kid who got killed in my plane overAvignon the other day. Snowden.”</p> 
<p>　　“What happened to him?” Milo asked in a voice deadened with awe.</p> 
<p>　　“He got killed.”</p> 
<p>　　“That’s terrible,” Milo grieved, and his large brown eyes filled with tears. “That poor kid. It really is terrible.”</p> 
<p>　　He bit his trembling lip hard, and his voice rose with emotion when he continued. “And it will get even worse ifthe mess halls don’t agree to buy my cotton. Yossarian, what’s the matter with them? Don’t they realize it’s theirsyndicate? Don’t they know they’ve all got a share?”</p> 
<p>　　“Did the dead man in my tent have a share?” Yossarian demanded caustically.</p> 
<p>　　“Of course he did,” Milo assured him lavishly. “Everybody in the squadron has a share.”</p> 
<p>　　“He was killed before he even got into the squadron.”</p> 
<p>　　Milo made a deft grimace of tribulation and turned away. “I wish you’d stop picking on me about that dead manin your tent,” he pleaded peevishly. “I told you I didn’t have anything to do with killing him. Is it my fault that Isaw this great opportunity to corner the market on Egyptian cotton and got us into all this trouble? Was Isupposed to know there was going to be a glut? I didn’t even know what a glut was in those days. An opportunityto corner a market doesn’t come along very often, and I was pretty shrewd to grab the chance when I had it.”</p> 
<p>　　Milo gulped back a moan as he saw six uniformed pallbearers lift the plain pine coffin from the ambulance andset it gently down on the ground beside the yawning gash of the freshly dug grave. “And now I can’t get rid of asingle penny’s worth,” he mourned.</p> 
<p>　　Yossarian was unmoved by the fustian charade of the burial ceremony, and by Milo’s crushing bereavement. Thechaplain’s voice floated up to him through the distance tenuously in an unintelligible, almost inaudiblemonotone, like a gaseous murmur. Yossarian could make out Major Major by his towering and lanky aloofnessand thought he recognized Major Danby mopping his brow with a handkerchief. Major Danby had not stoppedshaking since his run-in with General Dreedle. There were strands of enlisted men molded in a curve around thethree officers, as inflexible as lumps of wood, and four idle gravediggers in streaked fatigues loungingindifferently on spades near the shocking, incongruous heap of loose copperred earth. As Yossarian stared, thechaplain elevated his gaze toward Yossarian beatifically, pressed his fingers down over his eyeballs in a mannerof affliction, peered upward again toward Yossarian searchingly, and bowed his head, concluding whatYossarian took to be a climactic part of the funeral rite. The four men in fatigues lifted the coffin on slings andlowered it into the grave. Milo shuddered violently.</p> 
<p>　　“I can’t watch it,” he cried, turning away in anguish. “I just can’t sit here and watch while those mess halls letmy syndicate die.” He gnashed his teeth and shook his head with bitter woe and resentment. “If they had anyloyalty, they would buy my cotton till it hurts so that they can keep right on buying my cotton till it hurts themsome more. They would build fires and burn up their underwear and summer uniforms just to create biggerdemand. But they won’t do a thing. Yossarian, try eating the rest of this chocolate-covered cotton for me. Maybeit will taste delicious now.”</p> 
<p>　　Yossarian pushed his hand away. “Give up, Milo. People can’t eat cotton.”</p> 
<p>　　Milo’s face narrowed cunningly. “It isn’t really cotton,” he coaxed. “I was joking. It’s really cotton candy,delicious cotton candy. Try it and see.”</p> 
<p>　　“Now you’re lying.”</p> 
<p>　　“I never lie!” Milo rejoindered with proud dignity.</p> 
<p>　　“You’re lying now.”</p> 
<p>　　“I only lie when it’s necessary,” Milo explained defensively, averting his eyes for a moment and blinking hislashes winningly. “This stuff is better than cotton candy, really it is. It’s made out of real cotton. Yossarian,you’ve got to help me make the men eat it. Egyptian cotton is the finest cotton in the world.”</p> 
<p>　　“But it’s indigestible,” Yossarian emphasized. “It will make them sick, don’t you understand? Why don’t you tryliving on it yourself if you don’t believe me?”</p> 
<p>　　“I did try,” admitted Milo gloomily. “And it made me sick.”</p> 
<p>　　The graveyard was yellow as hay and green as cooked cabbage. In a little while the chaplain stepped back, andthe beige crescent of human forms began to break up sluggishly, like flotsam. The men drifted without haste orsound to the vehicles parked along the side of the bumpy dirt road. With their heads down disconsolately, thechaplain, Major Major and Major Danby moved toward their jeeps in an ostracized group, each holding himselffriendlessly several feet away from the other two.</p> 
<p>　　“It’s all over,” observed Yossarian.</p> 
<p>　　“It’s the end,” Milo agreed despondently. “There’s no hope left. And all because I left them free to make theirown decisions. That should teach me a lesson about discipline the next time I try something like this.”</p> 
<p>　　“Why don’t you sell your cotton to the government?” Yossarian suggested casually, as he watched the four menin streaked fatigues shoveling heaping bladefuls of the copper-red earth back down inside the grave.</p> 
<p>　　Milo vetoed the idea brusquely. “It’s a matter of principle,” he explained firmly. “The government has nobusiness in business, and I would be the last person in the world to ever try to involve the government in abusiness of mine. But the business of government is business,” he remembered alertly, and continued withelation. “Calvin Coolidge said that, and Calvin Coolidge was a President, so it must be true. And the governmentdoes have the responsibility of buying all the Egyptian cotton I’ve got that no one else wants so that I can make aprofit, doesn’t it?” Milo’s face clouded almost as abruptly, and his spirits descended into a state of sad anxiety.</p> 
<p>　　“But how will I get the government to do it?”</p> 
<p>　　“Bribe it,” Yossarian said.</p> 
<p>　　“Bribe it!” Milo was outraged and almost lost his balance and broke his neck again. “Shame on you!” he scoldedseverely, breathing virtuous fire down and upward into his rusty mustache through his billowing nostrils andprim lips. “Bribery is against the law, and you know it. But it’s not against the law to make a profit, is it? So itcan’t be against the law for me to bribe someone in order to make a fair profit, can it? No, of course not!” He fellto brooding again, with a meek, almost pitiable distress. “But how will I know who to bribe?”</p> 
<p>　　“Oh, don’t you worry about that,” Yossarian comforted him with a toneless snicker as the engines of the jeepsand ambulance fractured the drowsy silence and the vehicles in the rear began driving away backward. “Youmake the bribe big enough and they’ll find you. Just make sure you do everything right out in the open. Let everyone know exactly what you want and how much you’re willing to pay for it. The first time you act guilty orashamed, you might get into trouble.”</p> 
<p>　　“I wish you’d come with me,” Milo remarked. “I won’t feel safe among people who take bribes. They’re nobetter than a bunch of crooks.”</p> 
<p>　　“You’ll be all right,” Yossarian assured him with confidence. “If you run into trouble, just tell everybody that thesecurity of the country requires a strong domestic Egyptian-cotton speculating industry.”</p> 
<p>　　“It does,” Milo informed him solemnly. “A strong Egyptian-cotton speculating industry means a much strongerAmerica.”</p> 
<p>　　“Of course it does. And if that doesn’t work, point out the great number of American families that depend on itfor income.”</p> 
<p>　　“A great many American families do depend on it for income.”</p> 
<p>　　“You see?” said Yossarian. “You’re much better at it than I am. You almost make it sound true.”</p> 
<p>　　“It is true,” Milo exclaimed with a strong trace of old hauteur.</p> 
<p>　　“That’s what I mean. You do it with just the right amount of conviction.”</p> 
<p>　　“You’re sure you won’t come with me?”</p> 
<p>　　Yossarian shook his head.</p> 
<p>　　Milo was impatient to get started. He stuffed the remainder of the chocolate-covered cotton ball into his shirtpocket and edged his way back gingerly along the branch to the smooth gray trunk. He threw this arms about thetrunk in a generous and awkward embrace and began shinnying down, the sides of his leather-soled shoesslipping constantly so that it seemed many times he would fall and injure himself. Halfway down, he changed hismind and climbed back up. Bits of tree bark stuck to his mustache, and his straining face was flushed withexertion.</p> 
<p>　　“I wish you’d put your uniform on instead of going around naked that way,” he confided pensively before heclimbed back down again and hurried away. “You might start a trend, and then I’ll never get rid of all thisgoldarned cotton.”</p>
