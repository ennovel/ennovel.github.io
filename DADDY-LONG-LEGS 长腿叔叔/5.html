The English instructor said that my last
<br> paper shows an unusual amount of originality. She did, truly. 
<br> Those were her words. It doesn't seem possible, does it,
<br> considering the eighteen years of training that I've had? The aim
<br> of the John Grier Home (as you doubtless know and heartily approve of)
<br> is to turn the ninety-seven orphans into ninety-seven twins.
<br> 
<br> The unusual artistic ability which I exhibit was developed at an early
<br> age through drawing chalk pictures of Mrs. Lippett on the woodshed door.
<br> 
<br> I hope that I don't hurt your feelings when I criticize the home
<br> of my youth? But you have the upper hand, you know, for if I become
<br> too impertinent, you can always stop payment of your cheques. 
<br> That isn't a very polite thing to say--but you can't expect me
<br> to have any manners; a foundling asylum isn't a young ladies'
<br> finishing school.
<br> 
<br> You know, Daddy, it isn't the work that is going to be hard in college. 
<br> It's the play. Half the time I don't know what the girls are
<br> talking about; their jokes seem to relate to a past that every one
<br> but me has shared. I'm a foreigner in the world and I don't understand
<br> the language. It's a miserable feeling. I've had it all my life. 
<br> At the high school the girls would stand in groups and just look at me. 
<br> I was queer and different and everybody knew it. I could FEEL
<br> `John Grier Home' written on my face. And then a few charitable
<br> ones would make a point of coming up and saying something polite. 
<br> I HATED EVERY ONE OF THEM--the charitable ones most of all.
<br> 
<br> Nobody here knows that I was brought up in an asylum. I told
<br> Sallie McBride that my mother and father were dead, and that a kind
<br> old gentleman was sending me to college which is entirely true
<br> so far as it goes. I don't want you to think I am a coward,
<br> but I do want to be like the other girls, and that Dreadful Home
<br> looming over my childhood is the one great big difference. 
<br> If I can turn my back on that and shut out the remembrance, I think,
<br> I might be just as desirable as any other girl. I don't believe
<br> there's any real, underneath difference, do you?
<br> 
<br> Anyway, Sallie McBride likes me!
<br> Yours ever,
<br> Judy Abbott
<br> (Nee Jerusha.)
