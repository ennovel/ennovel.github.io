<br> Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,
<br> 
<br> You never answered my question and it was very important.
<br> 
<br> ARE YOU BALD?
<br> 
<br> 
<br> I have it planned exactly what you look like--very satisfactorily--
<br> until I reach the top of your head, and then I AM stuck. I can't
<br> decide whether you have white hair or black hair or sort of sprinkly
<br> grey hair or maybe none at all.
<br> 
<br> Here is your portrait:
<br> 
<br> But the problem is, shall I add some hair?
<br> 
<br> Would you like to know what colour your eyes are? They're grey,
<br> and your eyebrows stick out like a porch roof (beetling, they're
<br> called in novels), and your mouth is a straight line with a tendency
<br> to turn down at the corners. Oh, you see, I know! You're a snappy
<br> old thing with a temper.
<br> (Chapel bell.)
<br> 9.45 p.m.
<br> 
<br> I have a new unbreakable rule: never, never to study at night no matter
<br> how many written reviews are coming in the morning. Instead, I read
<br> just plain books--I have to, you know, because there are eighteen
<br> blank years behind me. You wouldn't believe, Daddy, what an abyss
<br> of ignorance my mind is; I am just realizing the depths myself. 
<br> The things that most girls with a properly assorted family and a home
<br> and friends and a library know by absorption, I have never heard of. 
<br> For example:
<br> 
<br> I never read Mother Goose or David Copperfield or Ivanhoe or
<br> Cinderella or Blue Beard or Robinson Crusoe or Jane Eyre or Alice
<br> in Wonderland or a word of Rudyard Kipling. I didn't know that Henry
<br> the Eighth was married more than once or that Shelley was a poet. 
<br> I didn't know that people used to be monkeys and that the Garden
<br> of Eden was a beautiful myth. I didn't know that R. L. S. stood
<br> for Robert Louis Stevenson or that George Eliot was a lady. 
<br> I had never seen a picture of the `Mona Lisa' and (it's true but you
<br> won't believe it) I had never heard of Sherlock Holmes.
<br> 
<br> Now, I know all of these things and a lot of others besides,
<br> but you can see how much I need to catch up. And oh, but it's fun! 
<br> I look forward all day to evening, and then I put an `engaged' on the
<br> door and get into my nice red bath robe and furry slippers and pile
<br> all the cushions behind me on the couch, and light the brass student
<br> lamp at my elbow, and read and read and read one book isn't enough. 
<br> I have four going at once. Just now, they're Tennyson's poems and
<br> Vanity Fair and Kipling's Plain Tales and--don't laugh--Little Women. 
<br> I find that I am the only girl in college who wasn't brought up on
<br> Little Women. I haven't told anybody though (that WOULD stamp me
<br> as queer). I just quietly went and bought it with $1.12 of my last
<br> month's allowance; and the next time somebody mentions pickled limes,
<br> I'll know what she is talking about!
<br> 
<br> (Ten o'clock bell. This is a very interrupted letter.)
<br> 
<br> 
<br> Saturday
<br> Sir,
<br> 
<br> I have the honour to report fresh explorations in the field of geometry. 
<br> On Friday last we abandoned our former works in parallelopipeds
<br> and proceeded to truncated prisms. We are finding the road rough
<br> and very uphill.
<br> 
<br> 
<br> Sunday
<br> 
<br> The Christmas holidays begin next week and the trunks are up. 
<br> The corridors are so filled up that you can hardly get through,
<br> and everybody is so bubbling over with excitement that studying is
<br> getting left out. I'm going to have a beautiful time in vacation;
<br> there's another Freshman who lives in Texas staying behind,
<br> and we are planning to take long walks and if there's any ice--
<br> learn to skate. Then there is still the whole library to be read--
<br> and three empty weeks to do it in!
<br> 
<br> Goodbye, Daddy, I hope that you are feeling as happy as am.
<br> Yours ever,
<br> Judy
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> PS. Don't forget to answer my question. If you don't want
<br> the trouble of writing, have your secretary telegraph. He can
<br> 
<br> just say:
<br> Mr. Smith is quite bald,
<br> 
<br> or
<br> 
<br> Mr. Smith is not bald,
<br> 
<br> or
<br> 
<br> Mr. Smith has white hair.
<br> 
<br> 
<br> And you can deduct the twenty-five cents out of my allowance.
<br> 
<br> Goodbye till January--and a merry Christmas!
