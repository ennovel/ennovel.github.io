<br> 
<br> 
<br> Here I am! I travelled yesterday for four hours in a train. 
<br> It's a funny sensation, isn't it? I never rode in one before.
<br> 
<br> College is the biggest, most bewildering place--I get lost whenever
<br> I leave my room. I will write you a description later when I'm
<br> feeling less muddled; also I will tell you about my lessons. 
<br> Classes don't begin until Monday morning, and this is Saturday night. 
<br> But I wanted to write a letter first just to get acquainted.
<br> 
<br> It seems queer to be writing letters to somebody you don't know. 
<br> It seems queer for me to be writing letters at all--I've never
<br> written more than three or four in my life, so please overlook it
<br> if these are not a model kind.
<br> 
<br> Before leaving yesterday morning, Mrs. Lippett and I had a very
<br> serious talk. She told me how to behave all the rest of my life,
<br> and especially how to behave towards the kind gentleman who is doing
<br> so much for me. I must take care to be Very Respectful.
<br> 
<br> But how can one be very respectful to a person who
<br> wishes to be called John Smith? Why couldn't you
<br> have picked out a name with a little personality? 
<br> I might as well write letters to Dear Hitching-Post or Dear Clothes-Prop.
<br> 
<br> I have been thinking about you a great deal this summer; having
<br> somebody take an interest in me after all these years makes me
<br> feel as though I had found a sort of family. It seems as though I
<br> belonged to somebody now, and it's a very comfortable sensation. 
<br> I must say, however, that when I think about you, my imagination
<br> has very little to work upon. There are just three things that
<br> I know:
<br> 
<br> I. You are tall.
<br> 
<br> II. You are rich.
<br> 
<br> III. You hate girls.
<br> 
<br> I suppose I might call you Dear Mr. Girl-Hater. Only that's rather
<br> insulting to me. Or Dear Mr. Rich-Man, but that's insulting
<br> to you, as though money were the only important thing about you. 
<br> Besides, being rich is such a very external quality. Maybe you
<br> won't stay rich all your life; lots of very clever men get smashed
<br> up in Wall Street. But at least you will stay tall all your life! 
<br> So I've decided to call you Dear Daddy-Long-Legs. I hope you won't mind. 
<br> It's just a private pet name we won't tell Mrs. Lippett.
<br> 
<br> The ten o'clock bell is going to ring in two minutes. Our day is
<br> divided into sections by bells. We eat and sleep and study by bells. 
<br> It's very enlivening; I feel like a fire horse all of the time. 
<br> There it goes! Lights out. Good night.
<br> 
<br> Observe with what precision I obey rules--due to my training
<br> in the John Grier Home.
<br> Yours most respectfully,
<br> Jerusha Abbott
<br> To Mr. Daddy-Long-Legs Smith
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 1st October
<br> Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,
<br> 
<br> 
<br> I love college and I love you for sending me--I'm very, very happy,
<br> and so excited every moment of the time that I can scarcely sleep. 
<br> You can't imagine how different it is from the John Grier Home. 
<br> I never dreamed there was such a place in the world. I'm feeling
<br> sorry for everybody who isn't a girl and who can't come here; I am
<br> sure the college you attended when you were a boy couldn't have been
<br> so nice.
<br> 
<br> My room is up in a tower that used to be the contagious ward
<br> before they built the new infirmary. There are three other girls
<br> on the same floor of the tower--a Senior who wears spectacles
<br> and is always asking us please to be a little more quiet, and two
<br> Freshmen named Sallie McBride and Julia Rutledge Pendleton. 
<br> Sallie has red hair and a turn-up nose and is quite friendly;
<br> Julia comes from one of the first families in New York and hasn't
<br> noticed me yet. They room together and the Senior and I have singles. 
<br> Usually Freshmen can't get singles; they are very scarce, but I got
<br> one without even asking. I suppose the registrar didn't think it would
<br> be right to ask a properly brought-up girl to room with a foundling. 
<br> You see there are advantages!
<br> 
<br> My room is on the north-west corner with two windows and a view. 
<br> After you've lived in a ward for eighteen years with twenty
<br> room-mates, it is restful to be alone. This is the first chance
<br> I've ever had to get acquainted with Jerusha Abbott. I think I'm
<br> going to like her.
<br> 
<br> Do you think you are?
<br> 
<br> Tuesday
<br> 
<br> They are organizing the Freshman basket-ball team and there's
<br> just a chance that I shall get in it. I'm little of course,
<br> but terribly quick and wiry and tough. While the others are hopping
<br> about in the air, I can dodge under their feet and grab the ball. 
<br> It's loads of fun practising--out in the athletic field in the
<br> afternoon with the trees all red and yellow and the air full of
<br> the smell of burning leaves, and everybody laughing and shouting. 
<br> These are the happiest girls I ever saw--and I am the happiest
<br> of all!
<br> 
<br> I meant to write a long letter and tell you all the things I'm learning
<br> (Mrs. Lippett said you wanted to know), but 7th hour has just rung,
<br> and in ten minutes I'm due at the athletic field in gymnasium clothes. 
<br> Don't you hope I'll get in the team?
<br> 
<br> Yours always,
<br> Jerusha Abbott
<br> 
<br> PS. (9 o'clock.)
<br> 
<br> 
<br> Sallie McBride just poked her head in at my door. This is what
<br> she said:
<br> 
<br> `I'm so homesick that I simply can't stand it. Do you feel that way?'
<br> 
<br> I smiled a little and said no; I thought I could pull through. 
<br> At least homesickness is one disease that I've escaped! I never heard
<br> of anybody being asylum-sick, did you?
