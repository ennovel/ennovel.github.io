<br> Exact date unknown
<br> 
<br> Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,
<br> 
<br> Is it snowing where you are? All the world that I see from my tower
<br> is draped in white and the flakes are coming down as big as pop-corns.
<br> It's late afternoon--the sun is just setting (a cold yellow colour)
<br> behind some colder violet hills, and I am up in my window seat
<br> using the last light to write to you.
<br> 
<br> Your five gold pieces were a surprise! I'm not used to receiving
<br> Christmas presents. You have already given me such lots of things--
<br> everything I have, you know--that I don't quite feel that I
<br> deserve extras. But I like them just the same. Do you want to know
<br> what I bought with my money?
<br> 
<br> I. A silver watch in a leather case to wear on my wrist and get me
<br> to recitations in time.
<br> 
<br> II. Matthew Arnold's poems.
<br> 
<br> III. A hot water bottle.
<br> 
<br> IV. A steamer rug. (My tower is cold.)
<br> 
<br> V. Five hundred sheets of yellow manuscript paper. (I'm going
<br> to commence being an author pretty soon.)
<br> 
<br> VI. A dictionary of synonyms. (To enlarge the author's vocabulary.)
<br> 
<br> VII. (I don't much like to confess this last item, but I will.)
<br> A pair of silk stockings.
<br> 
<br> And now, Daddy, never say I don't tell all!
<br> 
<br> It was a very low motive, if you must know it, that prompted the
<br> silk stockings. Julia Pendleton comes into my room to do geometry,
<br> and she sits cross-legged on the couch and wears silk stockings
<br> every night. But just wait--as soon as she gets back from vacation
<br> I shall go in and sit on her couch in my silk stockings. You see,
<br> Daddy, the miserable creature that I am but at least I'm honest;
<br> and you knew already, from my asylum record, that I wasn't perfect,
<br> didn't you?
<br> 
<br> To recapitulate (that's the way the English instructor begins every
<br> other sentence), I am very much obliged for my seven presents. 
<br> I'm pretending to myself that they came in a box from my family
<br> in California. The watch is from father, the rug from mother,
<br> the hot water bottle from grandmother who is always worrying for fear
<br> I shall catch cold in this climate--and the yellow paper from my
<br> little brother Harry. My sister Isabel gave me the silk stockings,
<br> and Aunt Susan the Matthew Arnold poems; Uncle Harry (little Harry is
<br> named after him) gave me the dictionary. He wanted to send chocolates,
<br> but I insisted on synonyms.
<br> 
<br> You don't object, do you, to playing the part of a composite family?
<br> 
<br> And now, shall I tell you about my vacation, or are you only interested
<br> in my education as such? I hope you appreciate the delicate shade
<br> of meaning in `as such'. It is the latest addition to my vocabulary.
<br> 
<br> The girl from Texas is named Leonora Fenton. (Almost as funny
<br> as Jerusha, isn't it?) I like her, but not so much as Sallie McBride;
<br> I shall never like any one so much as Sallie--except you. I must
<br> always like you the best of all, because you're my whole family
<br> rolled into one. Leonora and I and two Sophomores have walked 'cross
<br> country every pleasant day and explored the whole neighbourhood,
<br> dressed in short skirts and knit jackets and caps, and carrying shiny
<br> sticks to whack things with. Once we walked into town--four miles--
<br> and stopped at a restaurant where the college girls go for dinner. 
<br> Broiled lobster (35 cents), and for dessert, buckwheat cakes and maple
<br> syrup (15 cents). Nourishing and cheap.
<br> 
<br> It was such a lark! Especially for me, because it was so awfully
<br> different from the asylum--I feel like an escaped convict every
<br> time I leave the campus. Before I thought, I started to tell
<br> the others what an experience I was having. The cat was almost
<br> out of the bag when I grabbed it by its tail and pulled it back. 
<br> It's awfully hard for me not to tell everything I know. I'm a very
<br> confiding soul by nature; if I didn't have you to tell things to,
<br> I'd burst.
<br> 
<br> We had a molasses candy pull last Friday evening, given by the
<br> house matron of Fergussen to the left-behinds in the other halls. 
<br> There were twenty-two of us altogether, Freshmen and Sophomores and
<br> juniors and Seniors all united in amicable accord. The kitchen is huge,
<br> with copper pots and kettles hanging in rows on the stone wall--
<br> the littlest casserole among them about the size of a wash boiler. 
<br> Four hundred girls live in Fergussen. The chef, in a white cap
<br> and apron, fetched out twenty-two other white caps and aprons--
<br> I can't imagine where he got so many--and we all turned ourselves
<br> into cooks.
<br> 
<br> It was great fun, though I have seen better candy. When it was
<br> finally finished, and ourselves and the kitchen and the door-knobs
<br> all thoroughly sticky, we organized a procession and still in our
<br> caps and aprons, each carrying a big fork or spoon or frying pan,
<br> we marched through the empty corridors to the officers' parlour,
<br> where half-a-dozen professors and instructors were passing
<br> a tranquil evening. We serenaded them with college songs and
<br> offered refreshments. They accepted politely but dubiously. 
<br> We left them sucking chunks of molasses candy, sticky and speechless.
<br> 
<br> So you see, Daddy, my education progresses!
<br> 
<br> Don't you really think that I ought to be an artist instead
<br> of an author?
<br> 
<br> Vacation will be over in two days and I shall be glad to see the
<br> girls again. My tower is just a trifle lonely; when nine people occupy
<br> a house that was built for four hundred, they do rattle around a bit.
<br> 
<br> Eleven pages--poor Daddy, you must be tired! I meant this to be
<br> just a short little thank-you note--but when I get started I seem
<br> to have a ready pen.
<br> 
<br> Goodbye, and thank you for thinking of me--I should be perfectly
<br> happy except for one little threatening cloud on the horizon. 
<br> Examinations come in February.
<br> Yours with love,
<br> Judy
<br> 
<br> 
<br> PS. Maybe it isn't proper to send love? If it isn't, please excuse. 
<br> But I must love somebody and there's only you and Mrs. Lippett
<br> to choose between, so you see--you'll HAVE to put up with it,
<br> Daddy dear, because I can't love her.
